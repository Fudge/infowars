[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  You
[00:30.000 --> 00:43.640]  Do my amazing son Rex Jones who's now 19 years old today. We love you Rex
[00:43.640 --> 00:48.440]  You're such a great patriot and look forward to fighting the globals with you for many years to come
[00:48.440 --> 00:52.920]  Until we've read the planet of these monsters, but maybe not for many years to come
[00:52.920 --> 00:59.640]  I'd love to hang up my spurs. Ladies and gentlemen, the entire New World Order program is on fire
[00:59.640 --> 01:03.680]  And not in a good way. It is falling apart in front of us
[01:04.360 --> 01:07.840]  The developments are just simply amazing. I'm gonna fly back to Austin
[01:09.120 --> 01:11.120]  At 8 a.m. Tomorrow I
[01:11.920 --> 01:15.200]  Should be able to get back from the airport by the time the show kicks off at 11 a.m
[01:15.400 --> 01:18.920]  We're gonna have a lot of the articles and a lot of the documents a lot of the stories for you today
[01:18.920 --> 01:22.920]  I know Owen Troyer's gonna be co-hosting so you can show those all to you, but we have
[01:22.920 --> 01:30.480]  The number one and number two scientists of the FDA going public three weeks ago that writing a letter to lands it saying this will destroy vaccine
[01:31.480 --> 01:37.560]  Safety and people trust in vaccines for generations saying don't give it to children the regular vaccine is hurting people
[01:37.560 --> 01:39.920]  It's not a vaccine and don't give people boosters
[01:40.840 --> 01:48.800]  You then had one FDA board next to the highest level 26 to 2 vote last Friday to stop all the injections
[01:48.800 --> 01:56.320]  Basically yellow card. It's saying this drug clothes failing. We had another top FDA board over all drugs and vaccines on the
[01:57.560 --> 01:59.560]  Weekend on on the 18th Saturday
[02:01.040 --> 02:08.600]  Two days ago come out and vote 16 to 2 saying this drug quote is failing. It's not working. They call the drug down a vaccine
[02:08.640 --> 02:11.640]  That's what it is. It's a gene therapy. This is not a proper
[02:12.840 --> 02:17.600]  Proper approval and they went on to say you shouldn't give people boosters and you shouldn't give it to children
[02:17.600 --> 02:22.120]  Fauci and the head of the National Institutes of Health and others Collins
[02:22.520 --> 02:27.240]  All came out and said we're gonna give it to children. We're gonna give it to newborns
[02:28.560 --> 02:34.480]  But trust the science so this is Fauci that cooked up the bio weapon in Wuhan released it
[02:34.600 --> 02:39.400]  Obviously is released new strains. That's what all the top intelligence operatives and I believe them have said look out
[02:39.400 --> 02:43.360]  Just hit Texas and just hit Florida when we were open and had the lowest cases
[02:43.360 --> 02:48.240]  This is globalist bio warfare through the chai comms with their agents
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.480]  David Rockefeller was a chai comm agent helped set up the whole regime and power
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.000]  People like Klaus Schwab
[02:56.680 --> 03:01.400]  And people like Bill Gates are China files. They worship common is China
[03:01.880 --> 03:04.400]  They say we should never open China did a great job
[03:04.400 --> 03:07.160]  And I'm gonna talk about if we come back from break the key to all this
[03:07.160 --> 03:11.080]  I know I harp on this a lot, but I want to talk real slow for new listeners out there
[03:11.080 --> 03:14.160]  And I want all of us including myself really have this sink in
[03:14.960 --> 03:17.040]  We are facing a new type of war
[03:17.040 --> 03:22.440]  We're facing covert war against populations and against infrastructure and against our health and our souls
[03:22.760 --> 03:26.400]  Which is not a new type of war. It's really satanic satanic war. It's total war
[03:26.760 --> 03:29.640]  but it's a new type of war in modern times in that
[03:30.760 --> 03:37.400]  There's no announcement. There's no uniforms. There's no nothing there's people we think we should trust in positions of trust
[03:37.400 --> 03:42.800]  They're directing these attacks on us. So that is all coming up today
[03:42.800 --> 03:46.240]  And I want Troyer also has a very prominent medical doctor
[03:46.760 --> 03:51.880]  Sylvia studio with him. I'm I'm here still in DC in studio with him in the third hour
[03:51.880 --> 03:54.680]  In fact, the doctor gets there earlier probably get him in there
[03:55.440 --> 04:00.600]  Even sooner or maybe you guys are gonna take the fourth hour today. I'm just saying one hour is not enough
[04:00.840 --> 04:03.160]  That is all coming up in so much more
[04:03.160 --> 04:09.720]  Oh, and I want to talk about the undeclared war a covert war the perfect operating system for total tyranny
[04:09.720 --> 04:16.120]  And how to stop it becoming fully aware of the war and then seeing how things that are connected from the globalist own statements
[04:16.120 --> 04:19.240]  and how to stop this program and
[04:19.480 --> 04:23.840]  They were also going to look at the ongoing globalist invasion of the southern border
[04:23.840 --> 04:26.240]  We first broke it yesterday and of course it was confirmed
[04:27.080 --> 04:28.800]  another 10,000
[04:28.800 --> 04:33.320]  patients coming across a building up on the side of Rio no so by a
[04:33.960 --> 04:38.760]  Callan by plane hours away an hour away by car five and a half hours away
[04:39.120 --> 04:43.920]  200 plus miles away physically as the crow flies from del Rio. What's happening there?
[04:43.920 --> 04:49.400]  That's now all broken, but barely it did a box news reported local Texas news is reporting it
[04:49.440 --> 04:54.600]  But I searched the term this morning patients in McAllen. It was like two articles about it
[04:54.600 --> 05:00.800]  So this is just huge news. I will destroy your riding shotgun. We'll be right back. Stay with us
[05:00.800 --> 05:02.800]  We're already halfway through September
[05:03.400 --> 05:05.040]  2021
[05:05.040 --> 05:11.040]  It's just incredible and now the world is waking up that info wars was the tip of the spear and was dead on
[05:11.040 --> 05:13.480]  That's why it's more important than ever to keep us on air

[06:24.240 --> 06:31.360]  And we are back live thanks to the race of god, thank you so much for joining us on this live
[06:32.240 --> 06:34.240]  monday september 20th
[06:35.680 --> 06:37.680]  2021 edition
[06:37.680 --> 06:41.720]  I talked about this some last night, but I have got my notes here
[06:42.880 --> 06:47.640]  Specifically how physically incontinent but more importantly mentally in a continent
[06:49.000 --> 06:51.000]  Joe biden has become
[06:51.240 --> 06:53.920]  We're gonna be breaking that down at the bottom of the hour
[06:53.920 --> 06:56.880]  I've got all the notes right here several pages of them
[06:57.120 --> 07:01.640]  I'm gonna go over why this is so incredibly important directly from the secret
[07:01.640 --> 07:07.280]  Service directly from the secret service directly from the people that were guarding
[07:08.400 --> 07:10.400]  Biden in new jersey and
[07:11.000 --> 07:13.000]  on 9-11
[07:13.000 --> 07:20.960]  We can have a in new york and from inside the white house. This is from two separate sources in the secret service
[07:21.000 --> 07:23.000]  We're here in DC right now
[07:23.880 --> 07:29.800]  This is of the greatest national security import and it is exclusive horrible information
[07:29.800 --> 07:32.400]  I mean you've seen much of it unfold in the public eye
[07:33.360 --> 07:38.640]  But that's why they cancel a lot of biden events when he's not drugged up properly and going into full-on dementia
[07:39.640 --> 07:41.880]  But everybody else behind the scenes has to see it
[07:43.400 --> 07:47.400]  That's why when you see the secret service around biden or you see people talking to him or looking they're just like
[07:48.080 --> 07:50.080]  totally freaked out because
[07:50.080 --> 07:52.520]  It's it's it's it's the first truly
[07:54.680 --> 07:56.920]  Alzheimer's dementia ridden person
[07:56.920 --> 08:00.360]  In control the nuclear codes who had the election stolen
[08:01.680 --> 08:07.920]  For him and put into power then you've got the invasion at the south Texas border that's now stretched out over 200 miles
[08:08.960 --> 08:11.960]  Confirming again Fox News the DPS the state police
[08:12.480 --> 08:16.200]  The governor's office put out a report that yes, there's thousands and thousands of more Asians
[08:16.960 --> 08:19.640]  Five plus hours by car an hour by air
[08:20.520 --> 08:22.880]  200 plus miles away as the crow flies
[08:22.880 --> 08:27.600]  Coming across or are now building up on the reanosis side of McAllen, Texas
[08:28.480 --> 08:30.760]  This is just a complete collapse of the country and now it's confirmed
[08:31.760 --> 08:37.680]  That biden is basically taking the unaccompanied males the men with women the people with children
[08:37.680 --> 08:43.680]  They're all being flown different parts of the country broken up on the buses and turned into the Democratic Party
[08:43.680 --> 08:48.040]  That'd be a permanent underclass that they're gonna fly a few flights out for PR purposes
[08:48.040 --> 08:54.200]  But they told these people to come here just like biden said in March before the election a year and a half ago or now more
[08:55.120 --> 08:58.880]  He said if I win the election or when I get in immediately surge the border
[08:58.880 --> 09:03.800]  Well, he said 12 days ago for all the started. Hey, we're gonna let the Haitians stay
[09:04.360 --> 09:09.960]  And they stopped deportations of Haitians that are already gotten here. So they call their families and they said
[09:10.440 --> 09:14.920]  Now is the time to come into the country now is the time
[09:14.920 --> 09:18.400]  Vamanos underlay underlay underlay so that's Spanish
[09:18.400 --> 09:22.960]  I don't know how you say hurry up get here in in in French or in Creole
[09:23.680 --> 09:25.680]  But but there you go
[09:27.280 --> 09:29.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, and I don't blame these people want to come here
[09:29.920 --> 09:35.400]  The issue is they're gonna come here and be brainwashed for a Democratic Party operatives and the globalists have stolen the aid
[09:35.400 --> 09:41.040]  Help shut down a rob Haiti and all these other countries. Then they bring these people here to be another client group that they control
[09:41.400 --> 09:43.400]  So that's all coming up today
[09:43.400 --> 09:45.400]  I
[09:45.760 --> 09:50.320]  Want next segment to try to judiciously as best I can because they hope all this comes out
[09:51.520 --> 09:54.400]  They try to suppress all this and buy people off and control them
[09:54.400 --> 10:01.120]  But regulators in the EU regulators in India regulators even in Australia regulators in Russia
[10:02.240 --> 10:09.560]  Regulators in the UK regulators in Canada regulators in the United States have all come out and and the more come out the more courage there is
[10:09.560 --> 10:15.960]  And said look we yellow carded this so-called vaccine three months ago and said it should be pulled and we got ignored
[10:16.600 --> 10:22.280]  That's just the vaccine period the main advisory group for 20 years and as advised the UK government that's in the statute
[10:22.280 --> 10:24.760]  They're supposed to follow they're like, oh, we're not gonna follow them now
[10:24.760 --> 10:29.600]  And then the two head scientist quit at the FDA and then now they voted in two different boards
[10:29.600 --> 10:34.480]  When the highest board 16 to 2 the vaccines not working and this is endangering all vaccines
[10:34.480 --> 10:40.360]  The public's gonna never trust them again and children shouldn't take it and under and and and old people shouldn't take boosters
[10:40.360 --> 10:46.360]  And Israel says the boosters don't help you they give 48 hours of coverage that doesn't even mean anything so
[10:47.520 --> 10:51.400]  This is insane. This is crazy. But again, they did it on purpose and in their own
[10:53.480 --> 10:59.480]  Spars 2023 2025 document that we covered now six eight months ago. I forget how long ago
[10:59.480 --> 11:05.160]  We guys look up the spars report. That's like four million views on Bandai video. We'll put it on screen to give the actual date
[11:05.280 --> 11:09.920]  Five six months ago. I don't remember. I know general Flynn had a big gill about it said that reports dead on
[11:10.080 --> 11:14.000]  It's a war game and in the war game one year into vaccines
[11:14.080 --> 11:20.200]  It comes out they're killing everybody and causing heart attacks and neurological disorders and then all the regulators get in trouble
[11:20.360 --> 11:26.280]  But not big pharma and not Bill Gates. They even had that war game doubt that it's gonna cause heart attacks strokes
[11:26.280 --> 11:32.320]  That it'll then destroy confidence in the government and then you get into deeper parts of that document and others
[11:32.320 --> 11:39.120]  Then it means we overthrow the government. We that's the snow. It's globalist did this through the government who want to cause a civil war
[11:39.120 --> 11:45.080]  We want Gates. We want Fauci. We want Peter Dazik. We want the chai comms
[11:45.160 --> 11:49.720]  We want the UN the UN and the globalists did this through our government
[11:50.000 --> 11:55.200]  So then we lose total faith in it and everything collapses and I'm not saying have blind faith in the government
[11:55.200 --> 11:59.040]  But they're dissolving our republic framing it for the crimes. They've committed
[11:59.360 --> 12:05.440]  That they make our border patrol and National Guard go bring across millions. It's not two million this year
[12:05.840 --> 12:13.960]  Restimating eight to ten million by October 31st. That's the end of fiscal year 2021. That's directly in a hotel room with a senior
[12:15.400 --> 12:22.200]  Whistleblower from the border patrol. You have the head of the board full union saying everything I say they're ordered to complete the smuggling process
[12:22.200 --> 12:29.800]  They should just walk off because they're they're making it all orderly this giant invasion and then they complete the illegal activity
[12:30.280 --> 12:32.280]  And and so that's the case and
[12:33.040 --> 12:39.880]  They also have NGOs controlling it. So Owen, we're gonna cover a lot here today. We're gonna go over the incredible news lands it
[12:40.600 --> 12:42.960]  The publication not just a lands it study
[12:43.480 --> 12:46.200]  Lands it most respected group out their hands down
[12:46.200 --> 12:52.320]  New England medical journal John Hopkins. They're respected. That's because they want to quarterback the attack not all the scientists there
[12:52.320 --> 12:58.880]  But they're actually John Hopkins working group is what is under Gates command and swabs command on record with all these different war game drills
[12:58.880 --> 13:04.280]  They do the Rockefeller Foundation actually controlling it from on high, but then it's it's it's like
[13:06.000 --> 13:10.880]  Then managed by the Gates Foundation John Hopkins and the chai comms and the media below that
[13:11.840 --> 13:13.840]  They've don't come out and said look
[13:13.840 --> 13:15.840]  Fauci created the weapon
[13:16.440 --> 13:17.680]  Fauci did it
[13:17.680 --> 13:22.160]  Fauci's a total criminal and then Fauci fed fake medical journals info
[13:23.200 --> 13:27.160]  Into the main journals and lied and the whole house of cards is coming down
[13:27.160 --> 13:30.680]  So and if folks, you know, I don't give you positive news to give you fake positive news
[13:30.680 --> 13:32.200]  I give you the whole
[13:32.200 --> 13:38.680]  Hard scary facts because I believe in you and I believe that regulators and others that have been sheep dipped and brainwashed and
[13:38.680 --> 13:44.840]  Conditioned and gas lit to go along with this and suddenly find themselves inside this depopulation op
[13:44.960 --> 13:47.920]  Need to really see others on the outside say what it really is
[13:48.080 --> 13:52.880]  That's what we've done with all these doctors and scientists and medical reports and studies. And so now they really
[13:53.240 --> 13:58.520]  Know what they've done and a lot of them are now going to defect back to the reality and back to their own future and their own families
[13:58.520 --> 14:05.200]  Because they figure out this is a dystopia. They're building and so oh and this is a really big moment to watch the wheels go off worldwide
[14:05.200 --> 14:11.280]  Now they're moving forward with indictments against the regulators in India that try to block ivermectin from the public
[14:11.280 --> 14:13.280]  I've now cured everybody with ivermectin
[14:13.320 --> 14:20.600]  More in Australia. They've been caught secretly giving patients ivermectin because hospitals are doing a good job and not following the government's orders to murder people
[14:20.600 --> 14:24.160]  I mean, this is all this an exercise of pure power Owen and the wheels have come off
[14:25.520 --> 14:32.120]  Yeah, and now we have more evidence that the vaccines are neither safe or effective if
[14:32.840 --> 14:34.840]  Oscar de la Jolla and
[14:34.840 --> 14:38.240]  The contrast to joe rogan wasn't the perfect example
[14:38.240 --> 14:41.360]  We now have a gold medal olympic swimmer
[14:41.600 --> 14:47.020]  Anybody knows swimmers or maybe some of the most conditioned athletes on earth except for maybe boxers that would have been
[14:47.520 --> 14:53.000]  De La Hoya as the example who was fully vaccinated and now is in the hospital with
[14:53.440 --> 14:54.680]  COVID
[14:54.680 --> 15:03.280]  Alex I also have as you're kind of on the ground right now in DC on the ground digging deeply into the border story on the ground
[15:03.280 --> 15:09.120]  Digging deeply into what I guess the feds were trying to set up yesterday for the justice for J6
[15:09.120 --> 15:14.320]  Or they just were there and all such numbers that the one arrest happens to be a fed with a gun
[15:14.880 --> 15:18.240]  But there's so many other things developing here Alex. I
[15:18.760 --> 15:23.040]  Know it's yesterday's news, but I mean Hillary Clinton has been caught red-handed
[15:23.760 --> 15:26.560]  working with top executives and lawyers
[15:27.200 --> 15:30.240]  Framing Donald Trump so that she could spy on him now
[15:30.240 --> 15:33.800]  It's all out there, but but the media that lied about that's not gonna get caught
[15:34.440 --> 15:39.600]  We've got more border news Alex. We've got more news on the election front coming as well
[15:39.600 --> 15:46.600]  I mean, I can't even give you a surface-level view of this waterfront Alex without like ten minutes because so much is developing right now
[15:47.880 --> 15:51.040]  Well, you're absolutely right and so their whole narrative is falling apart
[15:51.040 --> 15:54.440]  But they still control the justice department so are able to carry out all this crimes
[15:54.440 --> 15:58.480]  We're in this paradox where they're in power when everybody sees what monsters they are. We'll be right back
[15:58.480 --> 16:03.440]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity
[16:03.960 --> 16:12.160]  This will be the most important message. You'll hear this year. Here's why we now have a small number of solar generators back in stock
[16:12.400 --> 16:19.120]  These emergency backup systems provide a life-saving backup power when you need it most and unlike gas generators
[16:19.160 --> 16:26.360]  solar generators run quietly emit no dangerous fumes and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the Sun
[16:26.360 --> 16:31.280]  Whether it's wildfires dangerous weather power grid issues or just getting off the grid
[16:31.280 --> 16:34.920]  You'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again
[16:35.320 --> 16:44.440]  Even better all this week radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses to go to my solar backup comm to learn more and check
[16:44.680 --> 16:49.440]  Availability, that's my solar backup comm look for the free report crisis cooling
[16:49.440 --> 16:55.440]  How to make absolutely sure your meat milk and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage
[16:55.440 --> 16:58.280]  Yours free at my solar backup comm
[16:58.480 --> 17:03.800]  Hey everybody, if you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food

[18:00.920 --> 18:05.920]  Globalist general Milley has revealed to the world that the United States
[18:06.280 --> 18:09.720]  It's not a free republic, but it's run by a permanent state by a network
[18:09.720 --> 18:16.080]  Birocracy the big takeaway here is is that he didn't act alone. He felt that he was safe to talk
[18:16.480 --> 18:23.080]  On an overseas phone line system that he knew was being watched by not just our government with the five eyes the Russians
[18:23.080 --> 18:27.360]  And the Chinese he wanted the world to know that he was proud of what he was doing
[18:27.600 --> 18:34.560]  Because he was backed by the deep state this permanent bureaucracy sees America as its enemy it sees the American people as his enemy
[18:34.560 --> 18:42.440]  It sees prosperity as its entity and it conspired with the Communist Chinese to threaten them basically and say Trump may nuke you
[18:42.640 --> 18:47.000]  But if he tries we'll call and say we're attacking you so you can respond first
[18:47.120 --> 18:53.040]  That's beyond treason, but it shows the type of anti-american sycophants living in their own fetid bubble
[18:53.040 --> 18:58.160]  They try to get away with this Milley and all of his accomplices to go to prison now for life
[18:58.160 --> 19:05.320]  What was the most important point in Joe Biden's declaration of war against America on Thursday, September 9th, 2021
[19:06.760 --> 19:11.720]  wasn't the announcement of forced inoculations of 80 to 100 million Americans wasn't the announcement of
[19:12.560 --> 19:18.280]  federalization of all the major cities the bypassing of state governors the threat to basically remove them
[19:19.560 --> 19:21.560]  No, it wasn't that was all bad enough
[19:22.480 --> 19:24.560]  It's the fact that he's following a UN
[19:24.560 --> 19:32.520]  Globalist Great Reset blueprint that Australia the UK Europe and the rest of Western world is and that this is just the beginning
[19:33.320 --> 19:35.320]  more lockdowns
[19:35.360 --> 19:37.880]  National medical IDs approved by the United Nations
[19:38.520 --> 19:44.200]  Carbon taxes that don't just track and trace you a tax you but actually tell you when you could go somewhere and what you could do
[19:44.200 --> 19:49.840]  It's all been announced at the UN level. This is a UN world government takeover
[19:49.840 --> 19:56.040]  Corporate revolution through global governments. It's illegal and Congress must stand up and stop it now
[19:56.040 --> 20:17.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:17.440 --> 20:25.880]  Ladies and gentlemen again, we are back live on this live Monday edition. I'm Alex Jones in DC
[20:25.880 --> 20:30.800]  I want Shroyer is in the ATX in Austin, Texas, and I want to just talk now
[20:31.560 --> 20:37.280]  About how big this is and just thank God for this because their entire globalist agenda
[20:39.000 --> 20:44.320]  Is about creating fear releasing a virus releasing other nanotech
[20:44.320 --> 20:51.760]  Simulant protein crystals that do grow and replicate yourselves like viruses. That's what they've made and
[20:52.680 --> 20:56.240]  To then basically target certain populations to scare them into submission
[20:56.640 --> 21:03.040]  And also make trillions of dollars while they kill you and intubate you to then further corrupt the medical system and take over
[21:03.240 --> 21:06.600]  They admit an operation lockstep. That's their plan. So we know the plan
[21:06.600 --> 21:10.720]  And so all we have to do is become aware of the plan admit to ourselves
[21:10.720 --> 21:17.720]  How horrible and evil the globalist are because that's a big thing to get over for most people and I understand but medical doctors and
[21:17.920 --> 21:19.920]  scientists and nurses and
[21:19.920 --> 21:21.920]  very prestigious people
[21:22.120 --> 21:26.040]  Across the board have gone public and I've talked off record to a
[21:26.800 --> 21:32.080]  Major head of a major biotech company that actually gets approval and creates real products
[21:33.520 --> 21:38.000]  And they told me eight months ago. Hey, I know this is bad. Don't take the vaccine. It's a gene therapy
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.680]  It's gonna hurt people Bill Gates and fouts. You're crazy
[21:41.480 --> 21:45.040]  It's all about power for them. My god watch. It's gonna blow up in their face and
[21:45.520 --> 21:49.520]  I'm like you got to say something you got to go public. Oh, no, you got a promise not to say my name
[21:49.800 --> 21:54.880]  You can tell people a big guy in biotech told you that because you know, I'm just not gonna fight these guys
[21:54.880 --> 21:59.320]  They'll crush you even me but watch they've bitten off more than they can chew and
[22:00.360 --> 22:04.560]  Here we are eight months later and and we're eight nine months into these injections here
[22:04.560 --> 22:07.920]  We're a year in the UK and it's hell on earth. So
[22:09.080 --> 22:11.200]  What I'm saying is as negative as it is
[22:11.920 --> 22:13.920]  Fauci was on TV Saturday and Sunday
[22:14.600 --> 22:18.960]  Going you can pull the clips up. They were on info wars.com a lot of you probably saw it going
[22:18.960 --> 22:23.760]  Oh, well, I think it's okay. The FDA is having a debate about science and boosters will see
[22:24.280 --> 22:29.240]  But then the head of the NIH comes out and says no, we're gonna do it same thing Boris Johnson says we're doing booster shots
[22:29.240 --> 22:31.880]  We don't care if their regulatory group said no
[22:32.400 --> 22:33.640]  so
[22:33.640 --> 22:38.600]  They've always covered up tainted vaccines and vaccines that have had things added to them and they've done
[22:39.080 --> 22:44.960]  Experiments through them, but those were old-fashioned vaccines that in many cases would protect you from measles mumps rebella
[22:45.160 --> 22:51.060]  They just might give a certain percentage of boys autism and some were contaminated with lung cancer viruses
[22:52.720 --> 22:55.720]  That's a fact the main mmr for 40 years has been
[22:56.360 --> 22:58.720]  Detaminated because they grow it on tissues that have that at them
[22:58.720 --> 23:04.680]  That's why peanut allergies didn't exist till 40 years ago, then they grew these people complained about fetal tissue
[23:05.120 --> 23:12.840]  They started growing it on peanut protein, and it worked real good except a certain percentage people given vaccines grown on peanut protein
[23:13.320 --> 23:18.160]  Would have would basically be violently allergic to it. Let's see. There's all those issues
[23:18.880 --> 23:24.540]  So they go, oh forget growing stuff on tissue forget doing all that. We'll just take the genome of
[23:24.540 --> 23:31.300]  A human being and just mix it in with mr. And a and then we'll just program the cells ourselves and then of course
[23:31.300 --> 23:37.500]  They're like but for 20 years you tried to get that approved in it certain percentage people take mr. And a kills them
[23:38.220 --> 23:44.940]  I mean folks I can play you congressional hearings. I have of the head scientist at Baylor who's pro vaccine
[23:45.660 --> 23:49.860]  But the dean of their biology department saying no one's ever succeeded at
[23:49.860 --> 23:57.380]  At a mRNA or no one's ever succeeded at a vaccine period for a coronavirus, but Bill Gates is trying again
[23:58.180 --> 24:00.340]  And he goes on to say and I think it's a great idea
[24:01.700 --> 24:03.700]  mad scientists folks
[24:04.860 --> 24:09.700]  Skip animal trials go directly to humans have no surveillance and then just hope you cover it up
[24:10.100 --> 24:13.980]  Hope you just say oh well you're censored on Facebook. You're censored on Twitter
[24:13.980 --> 24:21.620]  Oh, you can't talk about your son. It was in good shape and went to go play basketball inside with a heart attack was no heart defects
[24:22.140 --> 24:24.140]  five days after Moderna and
[24:24.460 --> 24:28.620]  The list goes on and on and now they admit. Oh, it's not as rare as we thought
[24:29.540 --> 24:34.100]  Your heart swelling or flat-out heart attacks. Oh, and then last October for even rolled it out
[24:34.220 --> 24:39.620]  Here's what we believe the side effects will be our scientists tell us their scientists aren't
[24:39.620 --> 24:45.180]  Stupid at the NIH and the CDC and the FDA that's above them or the British
[24:45.780 --> 24:49.980]  Medical system and they told them don't do it and then they did it
[24:50.340 --> 24:56.420]  But no and I like it this all the time to deep water horizon, which I watched some of the trawling line
[24:56.420 --> 24:58.420]  I read the transcript. I covered it heavily
[24:58.420 --> 25:02.660]  Back when the BP oil spill happened and that was because they were drilling the deepest
[25:02.660 --> 25:07.100]  well ever recorded at that time now they go even deeper yelling something like 30,000 feet and
[25:07.100 --> 25:13.620]  They told the engineers from England to Houston to the Gulf of Mexico
[25:14.140 --> 25:18.260]  They're the transcripts of this and they told them we don't want to use concrete in the hole
[25:18.740 --> 25:23.180]  You know as you fill it to keep pressure above the drill bit and the casings going down
[25:23.500 --> 25:31.180]  We believe you can just pump salt water in there and the pressure will hold the natural gas the oil in and they said
[25:31.180 --> 25:37.380]  Yeah, if you don't hit natural gas and oil, that'll be fine if we hit natural gas and oil even small patches
[25:37.380 --> 25:39.380]  It's gonna blow the rig up
[25:40.140 --> 25:42.940]  and they gamble these are gamblers and
[25:43.900 --> 25:47.140]  It blew up because they hit a gigantic gas well
[25:47.740 --> 25:58.820]  Okay, now they were so the media is now in the lands it and all the places going you rolled the dice and it really hurt people and we need to yell a card this vaccine
[25:58.820 --> 26:03.940]  That's the UK main advisory group the group under law. They're supposed to listen to it came out three months ago
[26:04.980 --> 26:09.940]  Now imagine they didn't roll the dice folks. They wanted to kill nationalism
[26:09.940 --> 26:16.020]  They wanted to push the you and they want a world ID. They want to divide and conquer the country's more to stop populism
[26:16.740 --> 26:21.940]  And they believe with big tech and corporate media and the rest of it. They could release a bio weapon
[26:22.860 --> 26:26.020]  and then release even more dangerous variants later and
[26:26.020 --> 26:30.100]  Scare everybody into accepting it and going along with the idea that a bunch of people died
[26:30.100 --> 26:34.980]  That's what the Gulf War syndrome was was the anthrax shots killed 40,000 US troops. We now know
[26:35.900 --> 26:41.820]  All the other militaries took it as well. They all got comparable per capita percentage of their troops that got sick and or die
[26:42.340 --> 26:49.420]  Something like 6% ended up dying within a couple years or quicker over 20% ended up getting sick French didn't take it
[26:49.420 --> 26:56.340]  They didn't get sick. We know all this their congressional hearings. Okay, so
[26:56.900 --> 27:00.100]  We already have tens of millions of boys that are autistic in the US alone
[27:00.100 --> 27:03.220]  It's all over the world and the more vaccinated the more it happens
[27:03.220 --> 27:08.220]  So they knew and we're testing but it has blown up in their face at their own regulators
[27:08.740 --> 27:13.700]  People that are paid off obviously corrupt most of the time have gone. Whoa. I'm coming to Jesus
[27:13.700 --> 27:19.840]  You're gonna give it all the little kids when we know it's causing them up to 16 times
[27:20.220 --> 27:23.660]  14 times 6 times in the studies have giant heart attacks
[27:23.660 --> 27:28.500]  We're gonna have hundreds of thousands of little boys with heart attacks little boys are amped up more than girls
[27:28.500 --> 27:30.500]  But little girls are dying too
[27:31.340 --> 27:34.140]  Again the healthier you are the more stuff like this kills
[27:34.140 --> 27:36.300]  You've already had problems and stuff that might not kill you
[27:36.300 --> 27:40.020]  But if you're an athlete or something and you go and you take something like this
[27:40.020 --> 27:43.980]  You're already tuned up. They're gonna kill you or you're you're gonna wish you were dead
[27:43.980 --> 27:48.140]  They say this heart swollen start swollen over a few hours and for a few days keep swelling
[27:48.140 --> 27:50.060]  They say it's like having a heart attack for three days
[27:50.540 --> 27:54.060]  So a lot of folks you have a big giant heart attack die right then that's a blessing
[27:54.060 --> 27:58.820]  But you're young and healthy and got a good heart and your heart swells up and the blood can't go through it for days
[27:58.820 --> 28:03.820]  You know the frickin pain they're under they have to sedate them and put them in comas. This is so bad. Okay, and
[28:04.420 --> 28:07.980]  When they come out of comas and don't die and have a damaged heart they tell them shut up
[28:07.980 --> 28:09.980]  You're not allowed to speak so
[28:10.780 --> 28:13.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna go to break. I'm gonna come and get Owens take on this
[28:13.300 --> 28:15.740]  We're gonna play a lot of clips and more than he takes over next hour, but
[28:16.860 --> 28:20.580]  Do you understand the vindication of all of you that warn people about this?
[28:20.820 --> 28:24.820]  Understand the vindication of info wars, but now here's our next big fight
[28:26.460 --> 28:29.060]  We've got to get all these articles together in special reports
[28:29.220 --> 28:33.380]  We got to get them up on info wars calm and banned out video because you can't put this out anywhere else
[28:33.380 --> 28:39.100]  And we have to get it out to everybody you've got to get it out now because they're just trying to paper over it
[28:39.100 --> 28:42.420]  Like it's no big deal and just move on. We're not gonna let them do it
[28:42.420 --> 28:46.540]  You're not gonna let them do it and you're the reason we've had so much success even though things are bad
[28:46.540 --> 28:51.740]  We're gonna be a lot worse against this make we could bring down their whole house of cards if we play this right
[28:51.740 --> 28:57.300]  So we're in the fight warms turning praise God. We'll be right back in four wars calm tomorrow's news today
[28:57.300 --> 29:04.100]  Hey everybody confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture me too
[29:04.100 --> 29:08.620]  But listen after all the research all the conflicting studies after all the squabbling
[29:08.620 --> 29:15.540]  There's one thing almost everyone agrees on it's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death
[29:15.580 --> 29:19.500]  You probably already believe that I certainly do so here's the thing
[29:19.500 --> 29:25.860]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate
[29:25.860 --> 29:28.820]  Some efficacy in immune support now
[29:28.820 --> 29:33.700]  You'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at stronger defense calm
[29:33.740 --> 29:36.740]  No cures or treatments there instead little known
[29:36.740 --> 29:44.180]  But shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune support product based on that research called immune 10x
[29:44.180 --> 29:48.580]  And the best part you can go to the stronger defense website right now and claim your own
[29:48.660 --> 29:52.860]  Supply of immune 10x without paying anything today crazy, right?
[29:52.860 --> 29:58.620]  Learn more about this unusual limited time offer at stronger defense calm. That's stronger defense calm
[30:00.660 --> 30:02.940]  When Bob Woodward's new book came out
[30:03.820 --> 30:09.980]  Alleging that General Milley had called the head of the Chinese military and said Trump might nuke you you tried to overthrow the US
[30:10.020 --> 30:13.860]  Government, but basically I'm protecting you and I'll warn you if we launch an attack
[30:13.860 --> 30:17.500]  Which was the greatest reason in US history that has ever been committed
[30:18.140 --> 30:22.140]  People said oh Alex it must not be true and I might wait Bob Woodbridge former naval intelligence
[30:22.140 --> 30:23.980]  He's a big insider globalist
[30:23.980 --> 30:26.780]  He wouldn't have put this out unless they wanted to put it out
[30:26.860 --> 30:32.840]  Say that Billy was a hero to set the precedent you can have a permanent bureaucracy stay behind network deep state
[30:33.260 --> 30:37.780]  Basically that has its own bureaucratic coup over America. That's why they put bite in he's so incredibly weak
[30:37.780 --> 30:39.780]  He's to undermine the idea of the presidency
[30:39.820 --> 30:44.540]  Well people said I was making it up with Bob Woodward's line. Well now Milley admits he did it
[30:44.540 --> 30:46.700]  You see I didn't need to trust Bob Woodward
[30:46.700 --> 30:52.220]  I remember Pelosi on January 8th ragging that she'd gotten a call from Milley that he'd taken control of the nukes
[30:52.380 --> 30:57.020]  So this treason was hiding in plain view back then and we covered it. See I have a memory folks
[30:57.020 --> 30:59.900]  I remember all this stuff. That's why I know it's true and what's false
[31:00.220 --> 31:02.220]  I'll tell you what's life and death
[31:02.300 --> 31:09.060]  If you don't have freedom of speech if you don't have the right to be able to communicate then you don't have a future
[31:09.540 --> 31:11.340]  Always when governments take away speech
[31:11.340 --> 31:17.420]  They then enslave the population and then they finally start exterminating the population and America the entire world is going down
[31:17.420 --> 31:20.700]  The tubes because the UN globals directed great reset
[31:20.780 --> 31:25.180]  That's why it's more important than ever that info or stay on the air and that all of us stay healthy

[32:00.340 --> 32:05.820]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies
[32:05.820 --> 32:10.740]  We are told and the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses
[32:10.860 --> 32:13.880]  Which is why fluoridated water is a big problem
[32:14.460 --> 32:20.860]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions
[32:21.220 --> 32:26.940]  Natural functions which have been known for millennia the Hindu chakras aligned with the endocrine system
[32:26.940 --> 32:30.100]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye
[32:30.100 --> 32:38.100]  Also described as the seat of the soul the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise
[32:38.620 --> 32:40.620]  Unseen dimensions of reality
[32:40.860 --> 32:48.820]  Fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy our water filtration systems with the proper filters
[32:48.940 --> 32:54.420]  We'll keep your drinking water fluoride free and the propure shower head will seal the deal

[33:02.740 --> 33:05.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:13.620 --> 33:15.620]  Big brother
[33:15.780 --> 33:17.780]  mainstream media
[33:17.900 --> 33:22.940]  Government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he
[33:22.940 --> 33:28.420]  Live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones
[33:28.420 --> 33:36.060]  I must be right. I must be right. I must be right. I must be right. I must
[33:41.100 --> 33:47.660]  Must be right, I must be right. I must be right. I must be right. I must be right
[33:47.660 --> 33:54.060]  I must come back ladies and gentlemen that is the puppet president of the United States, and I want to be 100%
[33:54.060 --> 33:59.780]  percent absolutely clear here because this is very important, this is the key to everything.
[33:59.780 --> 34:07.100]  It's not funny to me that Joe Biden is a complete absolute puppet, doesn't know who he is.
[34:07.100 --> 34:12.020]  It doesn't help our country, it doesn't help anybody but the globalist, so they can have
[34:12.020 --> 34:16.820]  him up there, they can commit all these crimes, they can destroy our country, they can sell
[34:16.820 --> 34:22.240]  us out, they can trigger a civil war, they can dissolve our borders, they can bring in
[34:22.240 --> 34:29.580]  all of our enemies, they can devalue our currency, they can push poison injections on us and
[34:29.580 --> 34:37.500]  national IDs and compulsory gene therapies and all the rest of it and the mask mandates
[34:37.500 --> 34:41.460]  and he gets all the hatred and he gets all the blame and he's a zombie that doesn't
[34:41.460 --> 34:46.380]  even know who he is because any other president, even if they're a globalist, doesn't like
[34:46.380 --> 34:50.740]  being hated and so they'll try to hide the programs and hide what they're doing because
[34:50.740 --> 34:56.140]  they care about their legacy but with Biden it doesn't matter because they have to drug
[34:56.140 --> 35:00.500]  him up and roll him out and then they put him on sedatives later and put him away, it's
[35:00.500 --> 35:04.660]  why he's only seen about an hour a day, if they have to he'll pop up for an hour, be
[35:04.660 --> 35:09.540]  gone five, six hours and then he'll come back out about half the time they cancel it or
[35:09.540 --> 35:16.020]  they cancel press conferences or they cancel events because he will just go off on a tangent
[35:16.020 --> 35:21.700]  and start being honest with people, I mean, three years ago he was like, yeah, they were
[35:21.700 --> 35:25.900]  investigating me and my son for corruption in Ukraine, so I said, you know, if you don't
[35:25.900 --> 35:30.140]  fire that prosecutor, you won't get that billion dollars by this evening, I'm flying out in
[35:30.140 --> 35:34.860]  a couple of hours, if we don't get word by the time we fly out, you'll get your billion
[35:34.860 --> 35:39.700]  dollars and son of a bitch, they fired the prosecutor, that was on television, everybody
[35:39.700 --> 35:45.540]  was like, whoa, he was at the CFR, Richard and Haas and others are like, okay, they're
[35:45.540 --> 35:51.700]  all looking down because Biden has not been playing with a full deck for about five years.
[35:51.700 --> 35:54.820]  I mean, hell, we got videos I didn't play yesterday where he said back when he was a
[35:54.820 --> 35:58.980]  senator, some of these videos are like 20 years old, he goes, you never make people
[35:58.980 --> 36:03.500]  take shots, you never make people go around their medical rights, you never release people's
[36:03.500 --> 36:08.780]  medical rights, medical records in general public because that is sacrosanct because
[36:08.780 --> 36:13.580]  it's tyranny and you can't have one size fits all, you don't know what medical issues somebody
[36:13.580 --> 36:16.740]  else has got, but they're not able to take shots.
[36:16.740 --> 36:20.500]  Talking about force inoculations, they've been pushing this forever, so the big lie,
[36:20.500 --> 36:24.940]  they also say, oh, we've always had force injections, we have one Supreme Court ruling
[36:24.940 --> 36:31.340]  from 100 years ago, it's 100 plus years ago, 103 years ago, it was the same ruling that
[36:31.340 --> 36:36.300]  said you could sterilize poor black people and white people, just because they're poor,
[36:36.300 --> 36:39.820]  you can make people take whatever shots you want, you can give people lobotomies, that
[36:39.820 --> 36:44.020]  got overturned later, so we have the Supreme Court say black people are two-thirds human,
[36:44.020 --> 36:51.420]  I'm not going to follow that crap, that's from 170 years ago, so look, I'm following
[36:51.420 --> 36:55.820]  my own rights, you can have the Supreme Court say because I'm white, I've got to be executed,
[36:55.820 --> 37:00.500]  I'm going to go to war, that's a legitimate and unconstitutional thing, our founders point
[37:00.500 --> 37:05.540]  out in the Ninth Amendment that all rights not listed or not reserved here that are just
[37:05.540 --> 37:12.420]  basic human rights that we know exist in our hearts are valid, this bill of rights doesn't
[37:12.420 --> 37:17.060]  give you your rights, it simply enshrines, this government is going to protect and defend
[37:17.060 --> 37:23.100]  those or it should be overthrown, that's the Declaration of Independence, so I'm not looking
[37:23.100 --> 37:26.460]  for civil war, I'm not looking for war, I'm not looking to kill globalists, I'm looking
[37:26.460 --> 37:30.660]  for them to stop and go away, but they're not going to do that, so we're going to identify
[37:30.660 --> 37:33.620]  them, we're going to expose them, we're going to deal with them legally and lawfully, but
[37:33.620 --> 37:37.060]  they're going to escalate, talk about that and how to beat them in the key next segment,
[37:37.060 --> 37:40.220]  but I want to get on with stake on this at the moment, but let me go ahead without further
[37:40.220 --> 37:45.020]  ado because I talked about this yesterday some and I said today I get into the details
[37:45.020 --> 37:52.300]  and so I have a note I took in the meeting with Secret Service and then we had another
[37:52.300 --> 37:55.980]  Secret Service contact, give us more, now I've got to be honest with you, you remember
[37:55.980 --> 38:01.020]  back five years ago, I thought we were being set up because I never thought the Secret
[38:01.020 --> 38:05.660]  Service would reach out to us, but they were so nice to us in Cleveland with the RNC that
[38:05.660 --> 38:11.060]  July and gave us so much info and would give us standing ovations and we drove around town
[38:11.060 --> 38:16.100]  and came into the big convention center that it was pretty amazing because they knew how
[38:16.100 --> 38:20.860]  bad Obama was, they were really like Trump and they wanted to beat Hillary, they knew
[38:20.860 --> 38:26.500]  she was cheating, but still when the Secret Service gives you direct information for the
[38:26.500 --> 38:32.100]  first time it's like really they're like Hillary has ambulances that follow her, she's collapsing
[38:32.100 --> 38:38.020]  almost every time she goes out, she's having convulsions, we think she's got a brain tumor
[38:38.020 --> 38:42.860]  and this is very, very important and we ask specificities that don't worry about that,
[38:42.860 --> 38:47.580]  we don't have all the specifics, they're very secretive, you've got reporters follow her,
[38:47.580 --> 38:50.380]  they have to take her off the drugs for her convulsions because those make you really
[38:50.380 --> 38:56.900]  sleepy and groggy, which is going to give a speech and a lot of times she ends up having
[38:56.900 --> 39:02.460]  one right around the time or after even during, she's collapsed a bunch, you've got to have
[39:02.460 --> 39:06.020]  crew followers, so we had very little crew, Millie, we were trying to follow her around,
[39:06.020 --> 39:11.540]  she didn't give a speech in Cleveland, Ohio later after the RNC and she was in a tent
[39:11.540 --> 39:16.780]  for an hour and a half, didn't give a speech and so she had the special glasses for the
[39:16.780 --> 39:21.420]  convulsions, so we missed that but then a European camera guy got to be by the back exit when
[39:21.420 --> 39:26.780]  Hillary came out to her ambulance, it's a black ambulance, she collapses and that footage
[39:26.780 --> 39:31.740]  is very famous, they tried to suppress the footage of Hillary collapsing or the media
[39:31.740 --> 39:35.420]  tried to cut it short and say she just stumbled, they didn't show her falling down and being
[39:35.420 --> 39:39.780]  put like a quote side of beef in the vehicle and the guy with the EpiPen who was always
[39:39.780 --> 39:44.900]  right next to her who could jab at in her to stop having it if she had a convulsion on
[39:44.900 --> 39:50.940]  the stage, I mean that's all a fact and later came out that was the case, so I've learned
[39:50.940 --> 39:56.180]  the Secret Service doesn't just give us info, like set us up with this info and so this
[39:56.180 --> 40:02.420]  is different Secret Service, this is two separate groups that reached out to us and wanted us
[40:02.420 --> 40:07.740]  to know this and good luck to the globalists, this was digital, this was face to face, I'm
[40:07.740 --> 40:16.300]  going to leave it at that, but real deep throat type stuff, you know what I mean, not parking
[40:16.300 --> 40:21.420]  garages but pretty close, so here is the information, Biden the day before 9-11 was
[40:21.420 --> 40:26.980]  at the intercontinental and was supposed to come down to meetings and go to events but
[40:26.980 --> 40:32.180]  would not come down and would not show up, he finally came down late, didn't know who
[40:32.180 --> 40:39.540]  he was or where he was, so he disappeared again then he was later going out at the helicopter
[40:39.540 --> 40:45.740]  on 9-10 and the doctor got out of the ambulance, a pelican size case about two feet by one
[40:45.740 --> 40:53.540]  foot out filled with all these drugs for Biden, the day before that he was in New Jersey and
[40:53.540 --> 40:58.380]  was late to a bunch of events and kept changing clothes because he was defecating all over
[40:58.380 --> 41:02.500]  himself, people can laugh at that, it's not funny, that's dementia, this is how bad
[41:02.500 --> 41:06.380]  it is, they got a puppet with the nuclear codes, this scares me for my children and
[41:06.380 --> 41:11.820]  quite frankly the whole world, again he was looking around, didn't know who he was and
[41:11.820 --> 41:16.460]  they said see the footage and we varied the footage of him on 9-11, they said 9-11 didn't
[41:16.460 --> 41:21.140]  know who he was, just running around to people and acting completely insane like a lobotomized
[41:21.140 --> 41:29.660]  gopher or something and then separately another group approached us and said in the White
[41:29.660 --> 41:34.300]  House, this is in the White House people, he roams the halls at night always saying
[41:34.300 --> 41:38.380]  I got to go bathroom, I got to go bathroom and just saying really embarrassing stuff
[41:38.380 --> 41:41.100]  they didn't want to repeat, they just said yeah you've seen what he says about getting
[41:41.100 --> 41:44.820]  his butt wiped right, well he's really kind of upset about it, ashamed of it, he makes
[41:44.820 --> 41:49.220]  jokes about it, he's in a whole other part, not in the residence area at night where
[41:49.220 --> 41:52.980]  they're operating the phones and stuff, low level people and he's stumbling around saying
[41:52.980 --> 41:56.140]  I need to find the bathroom, help me find the bathroom, they have to lead him back to
[41:56.140 --> 42:00.180]  his quarters on the other side of the White House and it's just a disaster ladies and
[42:00.180 --> 42:06.220]  gentlemen and then that's the thing they have to cut him off about now with the mics is
[42:06.220 --> 42:13.060]  he starts saying man you know my brain got taken out in the surgery and I've been, yes
[42:13.060 --> 42:21.060]  I, he'll say SH-T myself, he'll say why am I here, why am I here, who am I and you've
[42:21.060 --> 42:25.420]  seen him in public say who am I, why am I here, that's what he does when he shifts into
[42:25.420 --> 42:28.900]  the gear and anybody who's had family who's had Alzheimer's or dementia knows, you're
[42:28.900 --> 42:33.420]  sitting there coming to visit grandpa, they're fine, you're eating a hamburger with them
[42:33.420 --> 42:39.940]  and I got to take my clothes off, I got to go to the Boy Scout, I got to put my uniform
[42:39.940 --> 42:43.860]  on, they just go and that's what's happened with Biden, I didn't think these globalists
[42:43.860 --> 42:49.140]  had him there so he takes the blame when America goes down, we'll be right back in FullWars.com
[42:49.140 --> 42:52.700]  tomorrow's who's today and on my children that happened and that's what we were told
[42:52.700 --> 42:56.220]  by the Secret Service, that's real, that's going on, just like we broke, the Haitians
[42:56.220 --> 42:58.780]  slam into McCallan, that's not mainstream news.
[42:58.780 --> 43:04.620]  We've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp
[43:04.620 --> 43:09.100]  in World War II that when they came for one group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't
[43:09.100 --> 43:12.580]  stand up and then when they came for another group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't
[43:12.580 --> 43:17.580]  stand up and finally when they came for him there was nobody else to stand up.
[43:17.580 --> 43:21.220]  Well the Global Social Credit Score that China is putting in that's banning people to three
[43:21.220 --> 43:26.620]  hours of video games a week and if you criticize the government you can never buy or sell again.
[43:26.620 --> 43:31.060]  Well that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise of COVID, vaccine
[43:31.060 --> 43:35.060]  passports, they even admit it, now Thursday there's going to be a carbon tax attached
[43:35.060 --> 43:38.300]  to it, they're going to track where you go and what you do and decide where you can
[43:38.300 --> 43:39.300]  go and what you can do.
[43:39.300 --> 43:44.140]  That's what the lockdowns are about, you'll accept that, you'll accept anything.
[43:44.140 --> 43:48.300]  So again, the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending
[43:48.300 --> 43:51.620]  like they're part of the power structure but they're all going to be targeted by this nightmare
[43:51.620 --> 43:52.620]  as well.
[43:52.620 --> 43:56.380]  We need to get back to basic human rights and promote them or all of us will be enslaved
[43:56.380 --> 44:00.100]  by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists.
[44:00.100 --> 44:07.020]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class, not
[44:07.020 --> 44:12.540]  in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[44:12.540 --> 44:17.900]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class and that's done by design.
[44:17.900 --> 44:23.940]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[44:23.940 --> 44:28.820]  that look into say the Anglo-American establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg group, the trilateral
[44:28.820 --> 44:33.980]  commission of the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[44:33.980 --> 44:38.700]  Until 10 years ago the media said the controlled corporate media, the Bilderberg group, didn't
[44:38.700 --> 44:39.700]  exist.
[44:39.700 --> 44:44.060]  Well now the Bilderberg group is public and its former head, still on the steering committee,
[44:44.060 --> 44:50.100]  is Klaus Schwab and he has set up the great reset in global government and if as a liberty
[44:50.100 --> 44:54.740]  movement worldwide we don't address the globalist head on about the fact that they are a worldwide
[44:54.740 --> 44:59.780]  authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot, we do expose them, we can beat
[44:59.780 --> 45:00.780]  them easily.
[45:00.780 --> 45:06.940]  It's already halfway through September 2021, it's just incredible and now the world is
[45:06.940 --> 45:10.740]  waking up that Info Wars was the tip of the spear and was dead on.

[46:00.340 --> 46:05.140]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[46:05.140 --> 46:07.860]  for beta testing to operational.
[46:07.860 --> 46:12.620]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot
[46:12.620 --> 46:13.620]  takeover.
[46:13.620 --> 46:17.020]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working
[46:17.020 --> 46:21.660]  across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[46:21.660 --> 46:25.780]  Humanity is strong, we're incredible and if we're aware of the attack that's happening,
[46:25.780 --> 46:29.940]  we have a real chance of defeating it, if we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[46:29.940 --> 46:34.180]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential and warning
[46:34.180 --> 46:35.820]  others is absolutely essential.
[46:35.820 --> 46:40.420]  And at the same time, supporting info wars by buying high quality products to keep us
[46:40.420 --> 46:44.060]  on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family and they're
[46:44.060 --> 46:46.540]  also funding our operation.
[46:46.540 --> 46:52.020]  infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com is incredible, a lot of our products that have been sold
[46:52.020 --> 46:56.220]  out because the supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies, vaso beats and others,
[46:56.220 --> 47:04.180]  so get them today at infowarstore.com and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[47:04.180 --> 47:11.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:11.700 --> 47:24.940]  All right folks, final segment here that I'm going to host and then we've got a bunch
[47:24.940 --> 47:29.860]  of special reports that are extremely powerful, like the vaccine genocide must end, that's
[47:29.860 --> 47:33.340]  going to be at the start of the hour, six after Owen's going to be hosting, he's at
[47:33.340 --> 47:38.460]  a big medical doctor, one of the most prominent names that's been vindicated by what top regulators,
[47:38.460 --> 47:42.180]  not just here, but around the world have come out and said they're now inditing people
[47:42.180 --> 47:46.460]  in the government of India that work with Bill Gates, they've done that before five
[47:46.460 --> 47:51.020]  years ago and banned Bill Gates and his dad from the country, so he just bought off the
[47:51.020 --> 47:52.020]  federal regulators there.
[47:52.020 --> 47:56.460]  I mean, this is a bold assault, people go, why would the globalist assault us like this?
[47:56.460 --> 47:58.860]  They'll end up going to prison.
[47:58.860 --> 48:02.180]  Why did Hitler attack all of Europe and then attack the Russians?
[48:02.180 --> 48:09.060]  And this general staff told him, don't do it, it's called megalomania and these people
[48:09.060 --> 48:12.300]  have it and they've never gotten in trouble and it's a thrill to them and they want to
[48:12.300 --> 48:13.300]  depopulate it.
[48:13.300 --> 48:18.500]  When you look at Fauci, oh, I'm going to shoot a special report on this, I mentioned this
[48:18.500 --> 48:22.220]  last night when people discover this about Fauci, they don't believe me, so I'm not going
[48:22.220 --> 48:26.580]  to say it on ear, I'm going to get off here in like eight minutes, I'm going to go shoot
[48:26.580 --> 48:32.540]  the special report and then we will have it by the start of the fourth hour today.
[48:32.540 --> 48:38.980]  It's going to be short, it's going to be sweet, but it's going to be very, very powerful.
[48:38.980 --> 48:41.860]  And again, I'm getting on a plane at 8 a.m. in the morning, I should be back at the start
[48:41.860 --> 48:47.500]  of the show, regardless, there's no delays or anything, I will be there tomorrow and
[48:47.500 --> 48:50.980]  of course, you've got Owen and Harrison Smith did a great job with their own respective
[48:50.980 --> 48:56.380]  transmissions at Band-Aught Video, so remember, all of you that took all the heat were exposing
[48:56.380 --> 49:00.540]  the poison vaccines, all of you that took all the heat were being demonized and being
[49:00.540 --> 49:05.540]  attacked, all of you that went out and told the truth and all the nurses and doctors and
[49:05.540 --> 49:10.420]  scientists that told the truth in the last 18, 19 months, you've been vindicated and
[49:10.420 --> 49:13.500]  it's not about you getting pat on the back, I know you don't care, you care about life
[49:13.500 --> 49:16.420]  and justice and freedom in the future.
[49:16.420 --> 49:19.060]  Everybody that got in your face and everybody that told you you were wrong and said, oh,
[49:19.060 --> 49:24.660]  where's your experts and wouldn't let you talk, we have the two top scientists, we have
[49:24.660 --> 49:28.740]  them specifically saying it wasn't just about boasters, it was about the vaccine in general
[49:28.740 --> 49:33.300]  being a bad drug and then it's going to, quote, discredit vaccines for generations, because
[49:33.300 --> 49:38.380]  you could make clean vaccines that were tested and actually work, but they lower immune systems
[49:38.380 --> 49:41.780]  still when you do it, but there's something out there killing 5% of people, I want the
[49:41.780 --> 49:46.980]  vaccine, I want a clean vaccine, I want it tested, but they don't want that, they want
[49:46.980 --> 49:50.300]  the power to do what they want when they want, I'm all about technology, I wouldn't look
[49:50.300 --> 49:54.580]  up Regeneron, the company's been around since 88th, they're the most profitable company
[49:54.580 --> 49:58.980]  per capita, they're a small company, but they're the most profitable per capita, everything
[49:58.980 --> 50:03.100]  they've done has been a winner because they test the hell out of it for up to 5 years
[50:03.100 --> 50:08.620]  on animals and they have a lot of failures, but tested on rats and tested on guinea pigs
[50:08.620 --> 50:13.220]  and tested on pigs and yeah, then I don't like doing it myself, I mean, monkeys are
[50:13.220 --> 50:17.420]  really cool, but they test on primates too, it's come out because they want to know what
[50:17.420 --> 50:22.860]  it's going to do and these are therapies that then save millions of lives and it works,
[50:22.860 --> 50:27.420]  the thing is then it mutates, I've got to make a new one, but then Biden's trying to
[50:27.420 --> 50:32.060]  block that, that's not Biden, it's the cold blooded evil people at the big pharma companies,
[50:32.060 --> 50:37.220]  it's the Pfizer head who said on TV, he's not taking the shot, so they tell you what
[50:37.220 --> 50:43.220]  they're doing to your face, I want to just say this here though while we have the time
[50:43.220 --> 50:46.100]  and I want to take this little clip and put it on the last segment once we archive this
[50:46.100 --> 50:52.900]  video with this big Biden announcement, do you realize how dangerous it is to have someone
[50:52.900 --> 50:58.100]  who is in the middle stages of dementia, who they then use drugs to dial up and put teleprompters
[50:58.100 --> 51:02.940]  in front of, because he's able to read out the teleprompter, how that makes our enemies
[51:02.940 --> 51:07.300]  think A, we're foolish and bad and crazy and overrun and controlled, they don't respect
[51:07.300 --> 51:12.740]  that and scares them what could Biden and his controllers end up doing, this is not
[51:12.740 --> 51:17.460]  a message of strength, it's a message of weakness, which the globalists want to further demoralize
[51:17.460 --> 51:21.020]  and break down the country in the process of globalization.
[51:21.020 --> 51:26.120]  So this is a very destructive, very dangerous gamble, just like the globalists did Klaus Schwab
[51:26.120 --> 51:31.140]  and Bill Gates and they're running it, all the old money's dead now, they run it to depopulate
[51:31.140 --> 51:35.060]  us, I mean these are crazy people, they're very neurotic, they're very organized, they're
[51:35.060 --> 51:40.380]  very smart, but I can show you a really smart person that's a serial killer, in fact most
[51:40.380 --> 51:44.300]  serial killers have high IQs and they're the ones that get caught because they kill people
[51:44.300 --> 51:51.020]  by grabbing women out of the back of their yard or out of their house or at a car wash
[51:51.020 --> 51:56.820]  at night, no, no, the smart serial killers are called high functioning serial killers,
[51:56.820 --> 52:02.140]  high IQ and they always gravitate towards government and management and particularly
[52:02.140 --> 52:06.580]  medical research fields, because then they can get away with all sorts of stuff and I'm
[52:06.580 --> 52:12.740]  telling you, when I break this news at the end of the show today about Fauci and I'll
[52:12.740 --> 52:16.660]  just say it and I'll let it out now, because if I tell you it nobody cares, but if it's
[52:16.660 --> 52:23.180]  like an esoteric Q thing, except this is real, you follow breadcrumbs here, this is how Q
[52:23.180 --> 52:28.580]  would do it, it's something about Fauci, something about him that's very closely associated
[52:28.580 --> 52:31.340]  with him, what is it?
[52:31.340 --> 52:36.500]  And then a group affiliated with the Q disinfo op will go, it's his name, it's the name
[52:36.500 --> 52:39.620]  Fauci, what's that mean?
[52:39.620 --> 52:43.060]  And then they already know there's something similar in the media that is going to say
[52:43.060 --> 52:47.740]  that so they can then get your confidence that they know secret knowledge and then con
[52:47.740 --> 52:52.260]  you down the road, but you already have the magic relationship with Trump and the intelligence
[52:52.260 --> 52:56.580]  agencies, but you don't, you have a relationship with a globalist intelligence agency running
[52:56.580 --> 52:58.980]  a Soviet style operation trust on you.
[52:58.980 --> 53:03.740]  So if I say go look up operation trust, nobody looks up operation trust in the 1920s in Russia,
[53:03.740 --> 53:09.140]  how they rounded up the resistance, but if I say it has to do with an operation, with
[53:09.140 --> 53:14.620]  a name that means you should believe in someone, that you should put your faith in someone,
[53:14.620 --> 53:15.620]  what is that word?
[53:15.620 --> 53:16.620]  What is the operation?
[53:16.620 --> 53:20.580]  And then everybody would run around eight-channon, four-channon, oh my God, what is the, and
[53:20.580 --> 53:27.500]  the word's trust, we found the Soviet document, that's a Q is operation trust, 2.0.
[53:27.500 --> 53:30.900]  I'm telling you look up his name and it's all right there.
[53:30.900 --> 53:36.900]  His name, his name, his name.
[53:36.900 --> 53:37.900]  What does his name mean?
[53:37.900 --> 53:41.660]  See if I just told you no one would care.
[53:41.660 --> 53:44.660]  I even said what it meant last night on my show.
[53:44.660 --> 53:48.340]  No one cares, so I guess give you everything up front, but if I tell you look up his name
[53:48.340 --> 53:55.580]  and the county came from and what the family did and then where the grim reaper came from
[53:55.580 --> 54:07.500]  during the black plague in Italy, oh, ooh, ooh, so that's coming up into the show today
[54:07.500 --> 54:08.500]  with Owen Schroer.
[54:08.500 --> 54:12.220]  I'm gonna go get that done right now with my great crew, but like I said, there's just
[54:12.220 --> 54:13.220]  so much to break down.
[54:13.220 --> 54:16.340]  I'll say this and then get Owen's taking what I've been saying, he's about to take
[54:16.340 --> 54:17.340]  over.
[54:17.340 --> 54:22.820]  We can't operate without your support, you know we just keep winning thanks to God and
[54:22.820 --> 54:23.820]  your prayers.
[54:23.820 --> 54:28.540]  All the glory goes to God spiritually, but when it comes to you taking action, thank
[54:28.540 --> 54:29.540]  you so much.
[54:29.540 --> 54:35.420]  We're all in a better position now, we've come so far on a scale of one to 10, the globalist
[54:35.420 --> 54:39.500]  wanted to be at a 10 defeating us, a zero as we defeated them.
[54:39.500 --> 54:44.700]  They ran the tables at first and ran it out to about a seven, but hey, that's not the
[54:44.700 --> 54:45.700]  end of the race.
[54:45.700 --> 54:50.020]  We pushed that back to like a three right now with all these scientists coming out and
[54:50.020 --> 54:51.020]  everything.
[54:51.020 --> 54:54.540]  It's a big problem spitting this probably release a more deadly bio weapon to cover
[54:54.540 --> 54:58.700]  it up or launch a war or crash the stock market or have a cyber attack and you see that starting
[54:58.700 --> 55:00.220]  to happen right now today.
[55:00.220 --> 55:05.020]  So don't think we're out of the woods, but once we don't trust them and here's the key.
[55:05.020 --> 55:08.700]  Once we know this is a covert war by the globalists and who they are and once we get world leaders
[55:08.700 --> 55:12.900]  like the president of Austria has come out and said this is all new world order.
[55:12.900 --> 55:16.180]  All these other leaders are saying it's all new world order.
[55:16.180 --> 55:19.540]  Lands it saying Fauci released the virus himself, all the rest, you know, it's basically all
[55:19.540 --> 55:24.860]  coming out that Fauci is the main suspect and Fauci lied and created gain of function.
[55:24.860 --> 55:29.460]  Once that happens and once we identify them and once we make the sleeping giant wake up
[55:29.460 --> 55:33.740]  and see what's attacking it, it's game over and now they won't be able to pull more stuff
[55:33.740 --> 55:38.660]  because we'll say Kibono in Latin who stands the game.
[55:38.660 --> 55:43.980]  And so we're going to lay all that out here, ladies and gentlemen, but that's the key is
[55:43.980 --> 55:49.060]  getting everybody to recognize the globalist, want to be populist, want to take control,
[55:49.060 --> 55:52.780]  want to kill off the pensioners in their own words and are doing all this.
[55:52.780 --> 55:55.020]  And again, realize it's an undeclared war.
[55:55.020 --> 55:56.780]  It's a psi up.
[55:56.780 --> 56:01.180]  It's a disinformation up perfectly tailored so people never know what's hitting them so
[56:01.180 --> 56:05.580]  that while they attack us, they pose as saviors and get more control while they depopulate
[56:05.580 --> 56:07.620]  us and tell us, oh, global warming's coming.
[56:07.620 --> 56:08.620]  The third world's going to collapse.
[56:08.620 --> 56:10.540]  They're going to flood you.
[56:10.540 --> 56:12.060]  You didn't pay carbon taxes.
[56:12.060 --> 56:15.780]  That's the reason the third world's collapsing when it's cutting all the resources off and
[56:15.780 --> 56:19.540]  having a year and a half lockdown still going on in Africa and Latin America forces all
[56:19.540 --> 56:22.940]  these people up here to then invade us and be controlled.
[56:22.940 --> 56:23.940]  It's economic war.
[56:23.940 --> 56:25.660]  And they admit all this in their white papers.
[56:25.660 --> 56:27.460]  They admitted the replacement migration.
[56:27.460 --> 56:28.460]  This is their plan.
[56:28.460 --> 56:33.580]  Secret documents came out in 2007 from the Banff-Canada meeting where they said we're
[56:33.580 --> 56:38.620]  going to use viruses, the fear of viruses, collapsing third worlds and currency collapses
[56:38.620 --> 56:40.940]  to take over and set up a world government.
[56:40.940 --> 56:42.740]  We know we have their battle plans.
[56:42.740 --> 56:44.500]  We have their damn playbook.
[56:44.500 --> 56:47.300]  But our congressmen and senators need to get into the playbook.
[56:47.300 --> 56:48.300]  We need to get into the playbook.
[56:48.300 --> 56:53.220]  We need to understand this broadcast is not some weird flavor or political theory or some
[56:53.220 --> 56:54.980]  new denomination of a church.
[56:54.980 --> 56:58.740]  This is people studying the globalist operation and understanding what they're going to do
[56:58.740 --> 57:01.500]  and then trying to warn others to build up their resistance.
[57:01.500 --> 57:04.500]  So the sale is going to end on Sunday.
[57:04.500 --> 57:06.540]  It has to because a lot of the T-shirts are about to sell out.
[57:06.540 --> 57:07.540]  Some already have.
[57:07.540 --> 57:09.220]  We've got over 100 different designs.
[57:09.220 --> 57:11.820]  The new designs, the old designs, summer designer.
[57:11.820 --> 57:15.460]  Some are just low-cost, still high-quality.
[57:15.460 --> 57:23.060]  Some are limited edition, $9.95 for the lower-cost, $14.95 for the more expensive.
[57:23.060 --> 57:24.580]  That sale is going to end.
[57:24.580 --> 57:27.700]  Also ultra-12, 50% off, winter, some 50% off.
[57:27.700 --> 57:29.260]  That's going to end on Sunday.
[57:29.260 --> 57:32.260]  So take advantage of those sales and fund the InfoWar at InfoWarStore.com.
[57:32.260 --> 57:33.500]  These are great products.
[57:33.500 --> 57:37.500]  They boost your immune system and they make everything we've done here possible, so I thank
[57:37.500 --> 57:38.500]  you all.
[57:38.500 --> 57:39.500]  Tell everybody tune in now.
[57:39.500 --> 57:41.660]  We're starting to turn the tide together.
[57:41.660 --> 57:44.620]  The regulators worldwide are covering their ass and going public.
[57:44.620 --> 57:46.340]  The wheels are coming off.
[57:46.340 --> 57:48.860]  They're also admitting the vaccines are creating a new variance.
[57:48.860 --> 57:49.860]  We are winning.
[57:49.860 --> 57:50.860]  Thank God.
[57:50.860 --> 57:51.860]  I'll tell you what's often death.
[57:51.860 --> 57:56.380]  If you don't have freedom of speech, if you don't have the right to be able to communicate,
[57:56.380 --> 57:58.740]  then you don't have a future.
[57:58.740 --> 58:02.140]  Always when governments take away speech, they then enslave the population and then
[58:02.140 --> 58:04.300]  they finally start exterminating the population.
[58:04.300 --> 58:08.700]  And America, the entire world is going down the tubes because the UN Global has directed
[58:08.700 --> 58:09.940]  great reset.
[58:09.940 --> 58:13.260]  That's why it's more important than ever that InfoWar stay on the air and that all of us
[58:13.260 --> 58:14.260]  stay healthy.
[58:14.260 --> 58:18.740]  That's why I'm offering a bunch of our best selling products at 50% off for a limited
[58:18.740 --> 58:22.340]  time only until the end of the month of September.
[58:22.340 --> 58:26.180]  That's only about 12, 13 days as of the time we're taping this.
[58:26.180 --> 58:28.420]  And that means all of these amazing products.
[58:28.420 --> 58:31.740]  We have ultra 12, highest quality B12 taken out of the tongue.
[58:31.740 --> 58:35.660]  We have winter sun, highest quality organic vitamin D3 taken out of the tongue.
[58:35.660 --> 58:36.660]  Amazing.
[58:36.660 --> 58:37.660]  We've got knock out the sleep babe.
[58:37.660 --> 58:40.180]  We've got hair and beard formula that's got all the vitamins and minerals as well and
[58:40.180 --> 58:41.180]  not just your hair and beard.
[58:41.180 --> 58:46.500]  And we've got our great liquid turmeric formula all 50% off at infowarstore.com and it keeps
[58:46.500 --> 58:47.500]  us on the air.
[58:47.500 --> 58:48.500]  Take action.
[58:48.500 --> 58:49.500]  And I thank you.
[58:49.500 --> 58:50.500]  General Lee.
[58:50.500 --> 58:51.500]  It's General Milley.
[58:51.500 --> 58:58.580]  I just want you to know that Trump tried to overthrow the US government two days ago
[58:58.580 --> 58:59.580]  on January 6th.
[58:59.580 --> 59:04.140]  And I just want you to know I've taken control of the nuclear weapons and if Trump tries to
[59:04.140 --> 59:07.260]  launch an attack on you, we'll let you know first the attacks coming.
[59:07.260 --> 59:10.260]  That is from the transcript.
[59:10.260 --> 59:14.980]  Then he called Pelosi, Schumer and others to say, I'm loyal to you.
[59:14.980 --> 59:17.380]  I'm going to protect Trump from using nuclear weapons.
[59:17.380 --> 59:21.460]  When Trump was going for detente with China and North Korea at the time and Trump's responded
[59:21.460 --> 59:22.740]  saying it's a total lie.
[59:22.740 --> 59:24.860]  Pelosi's come out and admitted it happened.
[59:24.860 --> 59:29.780]  Hell, she bragged back on January 8th that it took place then and is saying that she
[59:29.780 --> 59:33.740]  honors Milley and that he's this courageous person, so we're all these other Democrats.
[59:33.740 --> 59:37.980]  So this is the permanent deep state coup that's been in control for a long time now coming
[59:37.980 --> 59:39.780]  out of the shadows publicly.
[59:39.780 --> 59:43.620]  Remember, these people literally hate you and your family, now they're injecting you
[59:43.620 --> 59:46.860]  with poison soft kill injections.
[59:46.860 --> 59:53.540]  Wake up America or be destroyed.
[59:53.540 --> 1:00:07.780]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:07.780 --> 1:00:12.420]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are in our two of the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:12.420 --> 1:00:15.860]  Owen Schroyer here in the Info Wars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[1:00:15.860 --> 1:00:18.900]  I'm going to be taking over from here on out.
[1:00:18.900 --> 1:00:25.180]  Alex Jones is going to be filing some special reports from DC and then you may be seeing
[1:00:25.180 --> 1:00:33.340]  and hearing from him again, maybe be doing some podcasts later on today as well.
[1:00:33.340 --> 1:00:36.500]  So be on the lookout for that.
[1:00:36.500 --> 1:00:40.740]  Let me just kind of hit the reset button on the broadcast here and tell you what I'm going
[1:00:40.740 --> 1:00:47.740]  to be doing for the remainder of this transmission until the fourth hour host takes over.
[1:00:47.740 --> 1:00:52.020]  Who is hosting the fourth hour today, guys?
[1:00:52.020 --> 1:00:58.220]  The always entertaining and informative Gerald Salente.
[1:00:58.220 --> 1:01:02.620]  So let me just tell you the waterfront of news here and then in the third hour, we're
[1:01:02.620 --> 1:01:09.940]  going to have a medical doctor in studio and I just got to tell you, I mean, it's an honor
[1:01:09.940 --> 1:01:13.460]  and a privilege to be meeting all these wonderful doctors and getting them on air.
[1:01:13.460 --> 1:01:21.540]  The frustrating aspect is I've probably now interviewed a dozen, two dozen doctors in
[1:01:21.540 --> 1:01:25.340]  the last year and a half and they all say, for the most part, the same thing.
[1:01:25.340 --> 1:01:29.180]  There might be a little differentiate over here or, you know, a different topic over
[1:01:29.180 --> 1:01:30.980]  here, but it's pretty much over all the same thing.
[1:01:30.980 --> 1:01:33.100]  The vaccines are neither safer or effective.
[1:01:33.100 --> 1:01:34.220]  Here's the truth about COVID.
[1:01:34.220 --> 1:01:37.900]  Here's the truth about the treatments and everything the mainstream is telling you is
[1:01:37.900 --> 1:01:38.900]  a complete lie.
[1:01:38.900 --> 1:01:40.420]  But it doesn't matter.
[1:01:40.420 --> 1:01:45.220]  I could interview 100 medical doctors and it still wouldn't make a difference, which
[1:01:45.220 --> 1:01:46.220]  is really frustrating.
[1:01:46.220 --> 1:01:51.900]  Or maybe it is making a difference and I'm just impatient or I'm just expecting more.
[1:01:51.900 --> 1:01:55.300]  But here's what we have coming up.
[1:01:55.300 --> 1:02:01.420]  I don't think it's irrelevant or old news to cover the lies from the Hillary Clinton
[1:02:01.420 --> 1:02:09.660]  campaign in 2016 and where the criminal indictment of her lawyer could potentially go.
[1:02:09.660 --> 1:02:13.380]  I understand most people sit there and they've been seeing the Durham story for four or five
[1:02:13.380 --> 1:02:15.620]  years now and they've just given up.
[1:02:15.620 --> 1:02:17.860]  I agree, completely agree.
[1:02:17.860 --> 1:02:22.940]  But the developments and now what we have the receipts on, I think are very significant.
[1:02:22.940 --> 1:02:24.220]  We'll talk about that.
[1:02:24.220 --> 1:02:28.780]  I've got this whole stack of COVID and vaccine news, people that are fully vaccinated, being
[1:02:28.780 --> 1:02:36.660]  hospitalized in the state of Washington, they're announcing quarantine camps, Australian style,
[1:02:36.660 --> 1:02:45.420]  all of that and more in this big stack of news, the latest debacles from the Biden administration
[1:02:45.420 --> 1:02:51.700]  where they've now confirmed what we already knew that the airstrike that Biden ordered
[1:02:51.700 --> 1:02:58.420]  in Afghanistan actually killed seven kids, seven children murdered by that airstrike
[1:02:58.420 --> 1:03:01.940]  and three civilians, none of which were the terrorists they claimed that they striked.
[1:03:01.940 --> 1:03:05.220]  And then they launched the strike, they said, look, we got a terrorist and they followed
[1:03:05.220 --> 1:03:09.700]  up saying we killed this terrorist and that turned out to be a lie.
[1:03:09.700 --> 1:03:14.060]  And it was all to save face because of the disastrous pull out from Afghanistan that
[1:03:14.060 --> 1:03:22.180]  resulted in dozens dead, including U.S. armed servicemen and women.
[1:03:22.180 --> 1:03:26.300]  So they launched the airstrike, they killed seven kids, they killed three innocent civilians
[1:03:26.300 --> 1:03:31.340]  and what is Joe Biden doing this weekend, he's riding around on a bike like a five-year-old
[1:03:31.340 --> 1:03:37.180]  that just got the training wheels off because that's his mental capacity.
[1:03:37.180 --> 1:03:42.220]  We've also got updates from the border.
[1:03:42.220 --> 1:03:47.540]  That is just a surrender of the United States sovereignty is the wide open southern border
[1:03:47.540 --> 1:03:48.540]  by Joe Biden.
[1:03:48.540 --> 1:03:55.020]  He surrendered the U.S. for an invasion at the southern border and you see that happening
[1:03:55.020 --> 1:04:04.540]  now we continue to be teased on election audit news coming out of Georgia and Arizona.
[1:04:04.540 --> 1:04:09.500]  But we're told that we'll have Arizona by the end of this month and we're told that
[1:04:09.500 --> 1:04:12.220]  we'll have Georgia by the end of next month.
[1:04:12.220 --> 1:04:17.100]  Again, it will have any consequence, I'm not sure, but we'll cover that.
[1:04:17.100 --> 1:04:25.700]  But of course, remember the media and the Democrats and the Capitol Police and the federal government
[1:04:25.700 --> 1:04:30.260]  built up a big event this weekend that was happening called Justice for J6.
[1:04:30.260 --> 1:04:37.060]  A couple hundred people showed up, all peaceful people and there was one arrest made and what
[1:04:37.060 --> 1:04:42.380]  is the, what are the odds or is it a coincidence that the one arrest that was made was a federal
[1:04:42.380 --> 1:04:43.380]  agent?
[1:04:43.380 --> 1:04:44.380]  That's right.
[1:04:44.380 --> 1:04:49.620]  It was a federal agent and who are the unindicted co-conspirators from January 6th?
[1:04:49.620 --> 1:04:52.100]  Are those also federal agents?
[1:04:52.100 --> 1:05:00.460]  Just like we saw this weekend, the only arrest of federal agents, hmm, very interesting.
[1:05:00.460 --> 1:05:04.780]  We're already halfway through September 2021.
[1:05:04.780 --> 1:05:09.180]  It's just incredible and now the world is waking up that Info Wars was the tip of the
[1:05:09.180 --> 1:05:10.700]  spear and was dead on.
[1:05:10.700 --> 1:05:13.940]  That's why it's more important than ever to keep us on air and I thank you all for your

[1:05:55.540 --> 1:05:56.540]  Please continue to support us.
[1:05:56.540 --> 1:05:58.220]  I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[1:05:58.220 --> 1:05:59.220]  Plus these are great products.
[1:05:59.220 --> 1:06:25.220]  Please take action.
[1:06:25.220 --> 1:06:37.020]  Thank you.
[1:06:37.020 --> 1:06:41.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, before I get into all of this news, as usual, we have big breaking
[1:06:41.760 --> 1:06:47.380]  reports with all of our great crew here, filed at band.video.
[1:06:47.380 --> 1:06:53.340]  And one of the recent ones that is so groundbreaking is from John Bowne.
[1:06:53.340 --> 1:07:01.540]  The vaccine genocide must end, you can find it at band.video, here it is.
[1:07:01.540 --> 1:07:06.540]  The federal government has shielded coronavirus vaccine manufacturers from personal liability
[1:07:06.540 --> 1:07:07.540]  lawsuits.
[1:07:07.540 --> 1:07:11.780]  Instead, there's a federal fund for those who can prove their injuries were caused by
[1:07:11.780 --> 1:07:15.020]  the vaccine less than one year after receiving it.
[1:07:15.020 --> 1:07:21.260]  They only pay non-covered medical expenses and lost wages as a general rule.
[1:07:21.260 --> 1:07:25.180]  Doctors should level the playing field if the vaccines are so reliable and their efficacy
[1:07:25.180 --> 1:07:29.180]  is so high, then revoke the vaccine maker's liability.
[1:07:29.180 --> 1:07:33.500]  But that will never happen because what is disguised as a pandemic is actually a full
[1:07:33.500 --> 1:07:37.260]  scale war on the inhabitants of western civilization.
[1:07:37.260 --> 1:07:40.060]  Joe Biden has known of the plan for decades.
[1:07:40.060 --> 1:07:45.380]  If we don't get one disease under control, you may find legislative bodies taking whole
[1:07:45.380 --> 1:07:51.260]  classes of people based upon propensity of conduct to say, we're going to put you in
[1:07:51.260 --> 1:07:55.380]  a certain category, we're going to demand mandatory testing for you.
[1:07:55.380 --> 1:08:04.860]  The affirmative task we have now is to actually create a new world order.
[1:08:04.860 --> 1:08:10.140]  While world leaders will ignore New York's COVID-19 vaccine requirement when they gather
[1:08:10.140 --> 1:08:13.820]  at the United Nations General Assembly this week.
[1:08:13.820 --> 1:08:16.340]  We must declare war on this virus.
[1:08:16.340 --> 1:08:20.860]  The United Nations, including the World Health Organization, is fully mobilized.
[1:08:20.860 --> 1:08:23.460]  We stand in full solidarity with you.
[1:08:23.460 --> 1:08:29.900]  Meanwhile, the FDA is finally coming to its senses on the vaccine deaths and injuries.
[1:08:29.900 --> 1:08:33.460]  I'm going to focus my remarks today on the elephant in the room that nobody likes to
[1:08:33.460 --> 1:08:37.060]  talk about, that the vaccines kill more people than they save.
[1:08:37.060 --> 1:08:42.980]  VARES shows heart attacks happen 71 times more often following these vaccines compared
[1:08:42.980 --> 1:08:45.060]  to any other vaccine.
[1:08:45.060 --> 1:08:50.980]  Even if the vaccines had 100% protection, it still means we kill two people to save
[1:08:50.980 --> 1:08:52.380]  one life.
[1:08:52.380 --> 1:08:57.660]  Four experts did analyses using completely different non-U.S. data sources, and all of
[1:08:57.660 --> 1:09:03.740]  them came up with approximately the same number of excess vaccine-related deaths, about 411
[1:09:03.740 --> 1:09:10.300]  deaths per million doses that translate into 150,000 people have died.
[1:09:10.300 --> 1:09:13.220]  Three treatments are a much better alternative to boosters.
[1:09:13.220 --> 1:09:18.060]  The proof is that in Israel, cases are at an all-time high.
[1:09:18.060 --> 1:09:25.100]  In India, Uttar Pradesh is now COVID-19 free as of today.
[1:09:25.100 --> 1:09:27.260]  Almost nobody there is vaccinated.
[1:09:27.260 --> 1:09:30.780]  While booster shots are fumbled by the Biden administration.
[1:09:30.780 --> 1:09:37.100]  Isn't announcing a specific date and a specific plan for the general population before any
[1:09:37.100 --> 1:09:42.100]  of the regulators, the FDA, the CDC, have approved it, isn't that the exact opposite
[1:09:42.100 --> 1:09:43.420]  of follow the science?
[1:09:43.420 --> 1:09:47.780]  We had looked at the data and it looked as if boosters were going to be a good thing
[1:09:47.780 --> 1:09:49.700]  for Americans to start to utilize.
[1:09:49.700 --> 1:09:54.940]  Bill Biden has tightened the screws on the deception pertaining to the lifeline of monoclonal
[1:09:54.940 --> 1:10:00.900]  antibody treatments, using the redistribution to punish red states that refuse his misguided
[1:10:00.900 --> 1:10:02.780]  draconian mandates.
[1:10:02.780 --> 1:10:10.020]  We are very, very concerned with the Biden administration and the HHS's recent abrupt
[1:10:10.020 --> 1:10:15.380]  sudden announcement that they are going to dramatically cut the number of monoclonal
[1:10:15.380 --> 1:10:19.580]  antibodies that are going to be sent to the state of Florida.
[1:10:19.580 --> 1:10:23.940]  He promised on September 9th that he was going to send 50 percent more supply of monoclonal
[1:10:23.940 --> 1:10:25.780]  antibodies to states.
[1:10:25.780 --> 1:10:31.820]  Yet, the Biden administration is cutting supplies in red states by 50 percent.
[1:10:31.820 --> 1:10:38.340]  Taking our role as the government overseeing the entire country is to be equitable in how
[1:10:38.340 --> 1:10:39.660]  we distribute.
[1:10:39.660 --> 1:10:43.980]  We're not going to give a greater percentage to Florida over Oklahoma, nor do I think are
[1:10:43.980 --> 1:10:44.980]  you suggesting that.
[1:10:44.980 --> 1:10:50.580]  Meanwhile, a local news station in Detroit recently asked its viewers on its Facebook
[1:10:50.580 --> 1:10:55.340]  page to comment on any unvaccinated hospitalizations or deaths.
[1:10:55.340 --> 1:11:00.740]  What followed in the comments section were scores of people recounting vaccinated related
[1:11:00.740 --> 1:11:06.700]  injuries and deaths, many questioning why the skyrocketing vaccinated injuries and deaths
[1:11:06.700 --> 1:11:13.340]  are being ignored as oncology wards are filling up with vaccinated patients riddled with cancer.
[1:11:13.340 --> 1:11:18.780]  As natural immunity continues to be demonized, regardless, that a recent Israeli study determined
[1:11:18.780 --> 1:11:23.820]  that natural immunity is 27 times more effective than the vaccines.
[1:11:23.820 --> 1:11:31.180]  And by the way, ladies and gentlemen, let me just say this, and this really is what separates
[1:11:31.180 --> 1:11:36.980]  info wars from most of the other media, especially those out in D.C.
[1:11:36.980 --> 1:11:44.140]  I can tell you, just like at the end of that John Bowne report, there are all kinds of
[1:11:44.140 --> 1:11:53.340]  threads out there on social media where it's just hundreds or even thousands of people
[1:11:53.340 --> 1:11:56.500]  that are talking about vaccine injuries.
[1:11:56.500 --> 1:12:00.380]  And it'll just be one person that starts it like, Hey, I don't understand.
[1:12:00.380 --> 1:12:01.980]  My dad was fully vaxxed.
[1:12:01.980 --> 1:12:07.700]  Now he's in the ICU with COVID and they say he's going to die or, Hey, I'm fully vaxxed
[1:12:07.700 --> 1:12:12.500]  and and now I'm in the ICU, not with COVID, but but I have a heart problem and the doctors
[1:12:12.500 --> 1:12:14.060]  tell me it's from vaccines.
[1:12:14.060 --> 1:12:17.940]  And then there's hundreds, if not thousands of comments of people saying the exact same
[1:12:17.940 --> 1:12:21.300]  thing, sharing their stories, and the media completely ignores it.
[1:12:21.300 --> 1:12:27.580]  And so that's just because I live this.
[1:12:27.580 --> 1:12:31.420]  I don't spend three hours a day in makeup.
[1:12:31.420 --> 1:12:36.740]  I don't spend my evenings whining and dining with politicos.
[1:12:36.740 --> 1:12:41.540]  That's what you get from most mainstream news, folks, three hours in makeup and then whining
[1:12:41.540 --> 1:12:45.140]  and dining with politicos all night, and then they have someone write their scripts, tells
[1:12:45.140 --> 1:12:46.140]  them what to do.
[1:12:46.140 --> 1:12:47.140]  They're not informed.
[1:12:47.140 --> 1:12:48.140]  They have no clue what's going on.
[1:12:48.140 --> 1:12:49.140]  They take the paycheck.
[1:12:49.140 --> 1:12:50.140]  They live the lifestyle.
[1:12:50.140 --> 1:12:52.900]  That's not how we operate here.
[1:12:52.900 --> 1:12:56.340]  We live this.
[1:12:56.340 --> 1:12:57.940]  So it's almost frustrating.
[1:12:57.940 --> 1:13:03.660]  Like on a weird ego competitive level, it's like, Hey, yeah, give us the exclusive.
[1:13:03.660 --> 1:13:04.900]  Let us be the most hardcore.
[1:13:04.900 --> 1:13:06.300]  Let us be the most informative.
[1:13:06.300 --> 1:13:09.540]  Let us be tomorrow's news today if you don't want to do it.
[1:13:09.540 --> 1:13:10.540]  But it's not even about that.
[1:13:10.540 --> 1:13:15.980]  It's about everything is at stake.
[1:13:15.980 --> 1:13:23.580]  And if people don't start to wake up, America won't exist as we know it or at all.
[1:13:23.580 --> 1:13:27.860]  So the vaccines is just one element of that dynamic.
[1:13:27.860 --> 1:13:32.900]  And I've got more on that coming up in this big, massive stack of news that I have right
[1:13:32.900 --> 1:13:37.020]  here that we're going to come back with and discuss.
[1:13:37.020 --> 1:13:39.220]  But here's a perfect example.
[1:13:39.220 --> 1:13:46.140]  I'm watching Fox News this morning and you have my little pony Dana Perino on there.
[1:13:46.140 --> 1:13:50.580]  And she's got, I think that same guy that was on with Wallace Sunday night.
[1:13:50.580 --> 1:13:56.980]  You know, some, some, some establishment, big pharma hack, just talking about how great
[1:13:56.980 --> 1:14:01.780]  the vaccines are and how successful the rollout has been and how they're going to be perfectly
[1:14:01.780 --> 1:14:03.020]  safe for kids.
[1:14:03.020 --> 1:14:08.780]  And it's time to vaccinate all the kids and even newborns is totally fine.
[1:14:08.780 --> 1:14:14.140]  And my little pony Perino just sits up there blinking with her 10 layers of makeup on and
[1:14:14.140 --> 1:14:19.780]  her hours worth of hair done and oh, you know, oh, I'm, I'm a news host.
[1:14:19.780 --> 1:14:20.780]  I'm a news anchor.
[1:14:20.780 --> 1:14:23.820]  I'm informing people.
[1:14:23.820 --> 1:14:25.460]  She does three hours of makeup.
[1:14:25.460 --> 1:14:26.740]  She's told what to say.
[1:14:26.740 --> 1:14:30.500]  And then she goes and winds and dines later that evening or plays fetch with her dog.
[1:14:30.500 --> 1:14:33.180]  Hey, hey, fine, Dana, I get it.
[1:14:33.180 --> 1:14:35.180]  You're a big establishment person.
[1:14:35.180 --> 1:14:36.780]  You came out of the Bush administration.
[1:14:36.780 --> 1:14:37.780]  You earned your keep.
[1:14:37.780 --> 1:14:39.300]  Take millions of dollars of Fox news.
[1:14:39.300 --> 1:14:40.300]  Good for you.
[1:14:40.300 --> 1:14:43.380]  You're not helping anybody other than yourself.
[1:14:43.380 --> 1:14:47.660]  And I think that your audience should know that and maybe they do by now.
[1:14:47.660 --> 1:14:50.020]  Dana, Perino might be the nicest person.
[1:14:50.020 --> 1:14:51.020]  I don't know her.
[1:14:51.020 --> 1:14:52.580]  I know she's not helping her audience.
[1:14:52.580 --> 1:14:55.060]  I know she's not informing her audience.
[1:14:55.060 --> 1:15:00.660]  I know that Fox news is shilling vaccines for big pharma just like they're told to.
[1:15:00.660 --> 1:15:06.620]  But see when I go into reality, whether it's people commenting on social media or I'm just
[1:15:06.620 --> 1:15:09.700]  living life and I'm just talking to people or I'm talking to friends or I'm talking to
[1:15:09.700 --> 1:15:13.220]  family and it's all the same thing.
[1:15:13.220 --> 1:15:17.100]  See, you're lucky.
[1:15:17.100 --> 1:15:18.100]  Consider yourself lucky.
[1:15:18.100 --> 1:15:19.740]  And it's sad to say this.
[1:15:19.740 --> 1:15:24.300]  You get the vaccine and you have a minor side effect, maybe two or three days of numbness.
[1:15:24.300 --> 1:15:25.460]  Maybe your arm goes numb.
[1:15:25.460 --> 1:15:26.460]  Maybe you get a fever.
[1:15:26.460 --> 1:15:27.460]  Maybe you get dizzy.
[1:15:27.460 --> 1:15:28.460]  Maybe you get nauseous.
[1:15:28.460 --> 1:15:31.900]  Maybe you get lightheaded headaches about two or three days about the average.
[1:15:31.900 --> 1:15:34.300]  That's like the good reaction.
[1:15:34.300 --> 1:15:40.940]  Oh, but see, a lot of people getting there, getting their myocarditis, a lot of people
[1:15:40.940 --> 1:15:43.580]  getting even worse COVID, a lot of people dying.
[1:15:43.580 --> 1:15:49.180]  In fact, when we come back, I'm going to start it off and I've got the latest VAERS numbers
[1:15:49.180 --> 1:15:51.820]  right here in front of me.
[1:15:51.820 --> 1:15:55.820]  The latest VAERS numbers on the vaccine injuries right here in front of me.
[1:15:55.820 --> 1:15:59.380]  And you tell me it's safe and effective.
[1:15:59.380 --> 1:16:03.460]  What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood-burning fireplace
[1:16:03.460 --> 1:16:05.640]  and not spend thousands doing it?
[1:16:05.640 --> 1:16:08.580]  You can with Great Wall of Fire fireplace grates.

[1:17:09.060 --> 1:17:11.660]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.

[1:17:13.180 --> 1:17:17.460]  And now to get around Big Tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[1:17:17.460 --> 1:17:18.460]  we've got.

[1:18:00.300 --> 1:18:05.180]  Record numbers of three humans across the planet, from Australia to Germany, the United
[1:18:05.180 --> 1:18:11.620]  States, to Canada, to Mexico, from Brazil to South Africa, understand we're under a great
[1:18:11.620 --> 1:18:14.860]  reset UN globalist attack.
[1:18:14.860 --> 1:18:21.060]  But none of our leaders other than Bolsonaro had trumped a little bit, seemed to understand
[1:18:21.060 --> 1:18:22.060]  that.
[1:18:22.060 --> 1:18:27.860]  And so no one is addressing the fact that this is a 21st century corporate economic war on
[1:18:27.860 --> 1:18:33.060]  the general population and the conversion of the planet into a high-tech technocracy
[1:18:33.060 --> 1:18:40.180]  with a global IP, global medical system, global medical, control, ID, and of course a carbon
[1:18:40.180 --> 1:18:43.860]  taxes that tied to that, the tractor every movement.
[1:18:43.860 --> 1:18:44.860]  This is their takeover.
[1:18:44.860 --> 1:18:49.820]  They admitted it, they said it, to no, the Prime Minister of Canada is on TV yesterday
[1:18:49.820 --> 1:18:54.660]  saying this is an environmental takeover plan and the whole lockdowns of just talking
[1:18:54.660 --> 1:18:56.340]  to prepare for climate lockdowns.
[1:18:56.340 --> 1:19:00.860]  So they're announcing their takeover, we've got a resistance, they know.
[1:19:00.860 --> 1:19:06.660]  Globalist General Milley has revealed to the world that the United States is not a free
[1:19:06.660 --> 1:19:10.940]  republic but is run by a permanent state-bound network, bureaucracy.
[1:19:10.940 --> 1:19:13.820]  The big takeaway here is that he didn't act alone.
[1:19:13.820 --> 1:19:19.780]  He felt that he was safe to talk on an overseas phone line system that he knew was being watched
[1:19:19.780 --> 1:19:23.780]  by not just our government, the Five Eyes, the Russians, and the Chinese.
[1:19:23.780 --> 1:19:25.380]  He wanted the world to know that.
[1:19:25.380 --> 1:19:29.460]  He was proud of what he was doing because he was backed by the deep state.
[1:19:29.460 --> 1:19:33.700]  This permanent bureaucracy sees America as its enemy, it sees the American people as
[1:19:33.700 --> 1:19:38.980]  its enemy, it sees prosperity as its enemy and it conspired with the Communist Chinese
[1:19:38.980 --> 1:19:44.060]  to threaten them basically and say, Trump may nuke you but if he tries, we'll call and
[1:19:44.060 --> 1:19:47.060]  say we're attacking you so you can respond first.
[1:19:47.060 --> 1:19:51.460]  It's beyond treason but it shows the type of anti-American sycophants living in their
[1:19:51.460 --> 1:19:54.500]  own vetted bubble that try to get away with this.
[1:19:54.500 --> 1:20:03.180]  Milley and all of his accomplices need to go to prison now for life.
[1:20:03.180 --> 1:20:24.340]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:24.340 --> 1:20:30.940]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:30.940 --> 1:20:34.020]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[1:20:34.020 --> 1:20:39.580]  I'm kind of like that clock we just showed on screen where the numbers are just ticking
[1:20:39.580 --> 1:20:45.060]  and spinning incessantly, nonsensically because my head is just spinning here and I'm going
[1:20:45.060 --> 1:20:50.260]  to have to stop it from spinning and get it focused to cover the stack of news.
[1:20:50.260 --> 1:20:54.140]  But seriously, it's just like, I'm just on a merry-go-round and no matter what angle
[1:20:54.140 --> 1:20:59.500]  I'm looking at outside the merry-go-round, it's just total clown world insanity.
[1:20:59.500 --> 1:21:03.300]  So here's the angle we're going to focus on right now with the COVID and the vaccine news.
[1:21:03.300 --> 1:21:05.580]  And we'll start with this.
[1:21:05.580 --> 1:21:15.300]  Now they already say, and for years, it's maybe 10% of actual vaccine injuries that
[1:21:15.300 --> 1:21:18.460]  get reported to the VAERS website.
[1:21:18.460 --> 1:21:22.260]  That's the Vaccine Adverse Reaction Government website.
[1:21:22.260 --> 1:21:28.420]  And so they had to set this up basically because the vaccine manufacturers were given legal
[1:21:28.420 --> 1:21:36.980]  immunity, no pun intended, but legal immunity to any potential lawsuits due to vaccine side
[1:21:36.980 --> 1:21:39.540]  effects like death.
[1:21:39.540 --> 1:21:44.060]  So to try to balance that out, they said, well, you'll have legal immunity, but we're
[1:21:44.060 --> 1:21:47.540]  going to have a website here for people to report their vaccine injuries.
[1:21:47.540 --> 1:21:57.580]  By the way, there's an organic upstart called vaxaction.com, that's just an organic peer
[1:21:57.580 --> 1:22:01.700]  to peer vaccine adverse reaction website, vaxaction.com.
[1:22:01.700 --> 1:22:03.140]  I suggest you use that.
[1:22:03.140 --> 1:22:06.300]  It's more interactive and it doesn't go through government censorship.
[1:22:06.300 --> 1:22:13.700]  But here's what we have as of September 10th.
[1:22:13.700 --> 1:22:23.180]  So just recently, these are updated numbers for the year 2021 on the official vaccine
[1:22:23.180 --> 1:22:25.020]  adverse reaction website.
[1:22:25.020 --> 1:22:29.740]  And by the way, all of these numbers are record highs.
[1:22:29.740 --> 1:22:35.420]  In fact, you may recall, I still have the graph in my office over here.
[1:22:35.420 --> 1:22:37.540]  Maybe someone from the crew can go grab it.
[1:22:37.540 --> 1:22:39.860]  In fact, guys, somebody do that for me.
[1:22:39.860 --> 1:22:44.740]  Somebody go grab the huge posters that are in my office.
[1:22:44.740 --> 1:22:45.740]  I see you guys back there.
[1:22:45.740 --> 1:22:47.180]  Yeah, just go grab them out of my office.
[1:22:47.180 --> 1:22:48.740]  You'll see them as soon as you walk into my office.
[1:22:48.740 --> 1:22:53.140]  The huge posters that show that all of these numbers are record highs.
[1:22:53.140 --> 1:23:01.540]  It'd be like, I mean, imagine the steroid era in baseball when for decades, the highest
[1:23:01.540 --> 1:23:07.780]  number of home runs was 60 or 61 home runs and nobody ever eclipsed 60 or 61 home runs.
[1:23:07.780 --> 1:23:08.780]  It was by far the best.
[1:23:08.780 --> 1:23:09.780]  Well, then what happened?
[1:23:09.780 --> 1:23:12.420]  Well, the player started using steroids.
[1:23:12.420 --> 1:23:16.340]  And so you had multiple guys hitting 60 home runs and even 70 home runs.
[1:23:16.340 --> 1:23:18.580]  And you said, whoa, something is up here.
[1:23:18.580 --> 1:23:20.540]  Well, the guys are using steroids.
[1:23:20.540 --> 1:23:21.860]  That's why you see all these records.
[1:23:21.860 --> 1:23:25.060]  And then they got rid of steroids and now the numbers have been pedestrian again.
[1:23:25.060 --> 1:23:28.620]  But that's just an analogy.
[1:23:28.620 --> 1:23:32.820]  The point is that these numbers are so high and that's quite frankly a bad analogy.
[1:23:32.820 --> 1:23:39.700]  That would be like if Mark McGuire or Barry Bonds hit 100 home runs in a season.
[1:23:39.700 --> 1:23:40.700]  That's what this would be like.
[1:23:40.700 --> 1:23:44.580]  It wouldn't be just, oh, Mark McGuire hit 70 or Barry Bonds hit 70.
[1:23:44.580 --> 1:23:51.060]  It'd be like if Mark McGuire and Barry Bonds or Sammy Sosa hit 100 or even 200 home runs.
[1:23:51.060 --> 1:23:55.500]  I mean, statistically, it'd be like 1,000 home runs if you would scrap late the actual
[1:23:55.500 --> 1:23:57.580]  percentages out.
[1:23:57.580 --> 1:24:04.100]  So imagine a baseball player hits 1,000 home runs in a major league season, 1,000.
[1:24:04.100 --> 1:24:07.500]  That's like as many bats as probably a record is, is 1,000.
[1:24:07.500 --> 1:24:12.060]  And now someone hits 1,000 home runs, you say, OK, something is wrong here.
[1:24:12.060 --> 1:24:16.260]  That's what's happening with the vaccine adverse reaction website.
[1:24:16.260 --> 1:24:19.140]  So these are all record highs, not even close.
[1:24:19.140 --> 1:24:22.780]  This is 1,000 home runs in a major league baseball season.
[1:24:22.780 --> 1:24:31.220]  You have 15,000 deaths from vaccines, 61,000 hospitalizations, 80,000 in urgent care, over
[1:24:31.220 --> 1:24:34.820]  110,000 doctor office visits.
[1:24:34.820 --> 1:24:42.820]  And then all of these other different side effects, 800, 8100 bells palsy, 6,000 anaphaxylitis.
[1:24:42.820 --> 1:24:45.140]  I'm probably butchering that.
[1:24:45.140 --> 1:24:52.820]  Almost 2,000 miscarriages, almost 7,000 heart attacks, almost 6,000 myocarditis, almost 20,000
[1:24:52.820 --> 1:25:02.740]  permanently disabled, over 15,000 life threatening, almost 30,000 severe allergic reaction, 3,000
[1:25:02.740 --> 1:25:09.420]  thrombocytophina, low platelet that's affecting your blood.
[1:25:09.420 --> 1:25:11.980]  And by the way, I'm also trying to follow up on a report.
[1:25:11.980 --> 1:25:14.140]  I'm going to be covering it later on the war room.
[1:25:14.140 --> 1:25:18.260]  In fact, I really don't even want to mention it yet because I just don't have enough information
[1:25:18.260 --> 1:25:19.820]  on this.
[1:25:19.820 --> 1:25:23.820]  But I know I'm in communication with enough people in the medical industry to maybe find
[1:25:23.820 --> 1:25:24.820]  some information on this.
[1:25:24.820 --> 1:25:31.020]  I'm hoping when I talk about on the war room later that people are drawing blood from vaccinated
[1:25:31.020 --> 1:25:36.460]  people and from unvaccinated people and what they're finding is just unbelievable.
[1:25:36.460 --> 1:25:39.580]  And from the little background research I did this morning, there's already some other
[1:25:39.580 --> 1:25:43.140]  whistleblowers out there talking about it.
[1:25:43.140 --> 1:25:47.460]  They analyze blood from non-vaccinated people and from vaccinated people and it's just stunning
[1:25:47.460 --> 1:25:49.580]  what is happening.
[1:25:49.580 --> 1:25:52.220]  But I'm going to digress off of that.
[1:25:52.220 --> 1:25:56.260]  So imagine, so these are the record numbers that we have and the crews, hey guys, just
[1:25:56.260 --> 1:25:57.460]  pull them in here live on air.
[1:25:57.460 --> 1:25:58.860]  Yeah, yeah, Rob, just bring them on in here.
[1:25:58.860 --> 1:25:59.860]  We got the cameras here.
[1:25:59.860 --> 1:26:02.900]  So just back that camera up.
[1:26:02.900 --> 1:26:05.740]  This was months ago.
[1:26:05.740 --> 1:26:09.340]  This was months ago and I believe the number on there is just over 10,000.
[1:26:09.340 --> 1:26:15.700]  Here, here, we'll have Rob be our model today and put these out in front of the desk.
[1:26:15.700 --> 1:26:20.500]  So imagine though, I went out on the streets of Austin, you may recall the video and I
[1:26:20.500 --> 1:26:22.980]  showed people how there's been almost 10,000.
[1:26:22.980 --> 1:26:25.500]  I believe this was in July.
[1:26:25.500 --> 1:26:30.940]  I believe this was in July and I showed, so again, so imagine a Major League Baseball
[1:26:30.940 --> 1:26:34.340]  player hits 500 home runs in a season.
[1:26:34.340 --> 1:26:36.460]  You'd say something is wrong here.
[1:26:36.460 --> 1:26:38.060]  That's just not right.
[1:26:38.060 --> 1:26:43.300]  So you went from about a thousand, according to the VAERS website, you went from about
[1:26:43.300 --> 1:26:49.500]  a thousand vaccine deaths a year and then you notice that number goes straight up, almost
[1:26:49.500 --> 1:26:53.780]  straight vertically, kind of like Joe Biden's vote tallies at 2 a.m. in the morning.
[1:26:53.780 --> 1:26:54.780]  Incredible there.
[1:26:54.780 --> 1:26:58.220]  And it just goes straight up and now, and now that, that was months ago before it hadn't
[1:26:58.220 --> 1:26:59.980]  even at 10,000 yet.
[1:26:59.980 --> 1:27:06.780]  Now it's at 15,000 as of September 10th, it's at 15,000 guys just put the, put the
[1:27:06.780 --> 1:27:10.780]  graphs on screen here so people can get, get the idea.
[1:27:10.780 --> 1:27:15.260]  So these are the official, this is a line graph and a bar graph because we don't discriminate
[1:27:15.260 --> 1:27:16.260]  here.
[1:27:16.260 --> 1:27:17.260]  We like all types of graphs.
[1:27:17.260 --> 1:27:22.540]  Maybe we should have a pie graph too, you know, be fully diversified, full screen shot.
[1:27:22.540 --> 1:27:26.680]  So you can see here, this was in July.
[1:27:26.680 --> 1:27:33.780]  These are the VAERS reported deaths from vaccines as of July and you'll notice a certain year
[1:27:33.780 --> 1:27:35.460]  it goes through the roof.
[1:27:35.460 --> 1:27:36.460]  Well that would be this year.
[1:27:36.460 --> 1:27:37.740]  What's the anomaly of this year?
[1:27:37.740 --> 1:27:39.700]  The COVID vaccines.
[1:27:39.700 --> 1:27:49.540]  And now the number is up to 15,000 deaths and they believe only 10% of the people actually
[1:27:49.540 --> 1:27:54.240]  report or even know to report a vaccine injury or side effect.
[1:27:54.240 --> 1:27:57.100]  So you could, you could go with those numbers.
[1:27:57.100 --> 1:28:02.020]  It may be aggressive to say, well, okay, let's multiply 15,000 by 10.
[1:28:02.020 --> 1:28:03.020]  What do you get?
[1:28:03.020 --> 1:28:04.020]  You get 150,000.
[1:28:04.020 --> 1:28:08.980]  150,000 people died of the COVID vaccine or is it just 15,000?
[1:28:08.980 --> 1:28:11.340]  Either way, not a good look.
[1:28:11.340 --> 1:28:12.980]  Either way, not a good look.
[1:28:12.980 --> 1:28:20.660]  And when you analyze the actual comparison year by year to vaccine related deaths, again,
[1:28:20.660 --> 1:28:27.340]  it's like a Major League Baseball player hitting 500 home runs in a season or it's like the,
[1:28:27.340 --> 1:28:28.820]  the football season just started.
[1:28:28.820 --> 1:28:35.180]  It'd be like if a quarterback through 300 touchdown passes in a year or a running back
[1:28:35.180 --> 1:28:39.860]  runs for, for, for 20,000 yards in one season.
[1:28:39.860 --> 1:28:40.860]  It's off the charts.
[1:28:40.860 --> 1:28:42.100]  It's never been seen before.
[1:28:42.100 --> 1:28:43.900]  It's, it's, it's immeasurable.
[1:28:43.900 --> 1:28:45.220]  And I haven't even gotten to the news.
[1:28:45.220 --> 1:28:51.300]  This is just one story of the vaccine injury website, the official government website reporting
[1:28:51.300 --> 1:28:59.260]  15,000 vaccine deaths in the year 2021 alone.
[1:28:59.260 --> 1:29:00.380]  Attention radio listeners.
[1:29:00.380 --> 1:29:05.300]  If you're concerned about the coming chaos after the November elections, this will be
[1:29:05.300 --> 1:29:07.380]  an extremely important message.
[1:29:07.380 --> 1:29:08.380]  Here's why.
[1:29:08.380 --> 1:29:15.180]  No matter what the outcome in November, catastrophic social upheaval is a very real possibility.
[1:29:15.180 --> 1:29:16.420]  Here's why this is important.
[1:29:16.420 --> 1:29:21.300]  Listen, we all know that silver and gold have been historic hedges against the uncertain
[1:29:21.300 --> 1:29:25.100]  waves of social chaos and unstable currencies.
[1:29:25.100 --> 1:29:29.780]  But did you know that there's been times in the past during times of extreme hardship
[1:29:29.780 --> 1:29:34.220]  when Americans put another store of value above even silver and gold?
[1:29:34.220 --> 1:29:35.220]  It's true.
[1:29:35.220 --> 1:29:39.940]  Open pollinated seeds have been and could very well be the ultimate store of value in
[1:29:39.940 --> 1:29:41.660]  the coming hard times ahead.
[1:29:41.660 --> 1:29:45.800]  Go to survivalseedbank.com to get heirloom seeds below wholesale.
[1:29:45.800 --> 1:29:51.100]  Visit survivalseedbank.com this week and get hundreds of dollars in free bonuses.

[1:29:53.740 --> 1:29:55.420]  But above all, don't wait.
[1:29:55.420 --> 1:30:00.620]  Beat the crowds by claiming your own survival seed bank today.
[1:30:00.620 --> 1:30:05.580]  When Bob Woodward's new book came out, alleging that General Milley had called the head of
[1:30:05.580 --> 1:30:10.460]  the Chinese military and said, Trump might nuke you, he tried to overthrow the U.S. government.
[1:30:10.460 --> 1:30:14.300]  But basically, I'm protecting you and I'll warn you if we launch an attack, which was
[1:30:14.300 --> 1:30:18.020]  the greatest reason in the U.S. history that has ever been committed.
[1:30:18.020 --> 1:30:19.420]  People said, oh, Alex, it must not be true.
[1:30:19.420 --> 1:30:20.420]  And I might wait.
[1:30:20.420 --> 1:30:23.900]  Bob Woodward's former naval intelligence, he's a big insider globalist.
[1:30:23.900 --> 1:30:27.220]  He wouldn't have flipped this out unless they wanted to put it out and say that Milley was
[1:30:27.220 --> 1:30:29.500]  a hero to set the precedent.
[1:30:29.500 --> 1:30:33.420]  You can have a permanent bureaucracy stay behind network deep state basically that has
[1:30:33.420 --> 1:30:34.980]  its own bureaucratic coup over America.
[1:30:34.980 --> 1:30:36.300]  That's why he put bite in.
[1:30:36.300 --> 1:30:39.300]  He's so incredibly weak to undermine the idea of the presidency.
[1:30:39.300 --> 1:30:42.660]  Well, people said I was making it up with Bob Woodward's line.
[1:30:42.660 --> 1:30:44.420]  Well now Milley admits he did it.
[1:30:44.420 --> 1:30:46.140]  You see, I didn't need to trust Bob Woodward.
[1:30:46.140 --> 1:30:50.700]  I remember Pelosi on January 8th ragging that she'd gotten a call from Milley that he'd
[1:30:50.700 --> 1:30:52.220]  taken control of the nukes.
[1:30:52.220 --> 1:30:55.220]  So this treason was hiding and playing to you back then and we covered it.
[1:30:55.220 --> 1:30:56.500]  See, I have a memory, folks.
[1:30:56.500 --> 1:30:58.020]  I remember all this stuff.
[1:30:58.020 --> 1:30:59.900]  That's why I know it's true and what's false.
[1:30:59.900 --> 1:31:05.260]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something.
[1:31:05.260 --> 1:31:09.620]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[1:31:09.620 --> 1:31:10.620]  the years.
[1:31:10.620 --> 1:31:14.540]  I am truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners
[1:31:14.540 --> 1:31:15.540]  of this show.
[1:31:15.540 --> 1:31:18.060]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[1:31:18.060 --> 1:31:21.380]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[1:31:21.380 --> 1:31:22.380]  You've got red blood.
[1:31:22.380 --> 1:31:27.420]  And if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers
[1:31:27.420 --> 1:31:31.780]  and sisters together and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you
[1:31:31.780 --> 1:31:32.780]  over the years.
[1:31:32.780 --> 1:31:36.340]  And as crazy as your things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[1:31:36.340 --> 1:31:39.780]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[1:31:39.780 --> 1:31:44.780]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[1:31:44.780 --> 1:31:47.180]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[1:31:47.180 --> 1:31:50.780]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've
[1:31:50.780 --> 1:31:56.300]  done and just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you and hopefully
[1:31:56.300 --> 1:31:58.780]  God will touch your heart to continue to support Him for worse.
[1:31:58.780 --> 1:31:59.780]  God bless.
[1:31:59.780 --> 1:32:02.220]  I'll tell you what's lying for death.
[1:32:02.220 --> 1:32:07.020]  If you don't have freedom of speech, if you don't have the right to be able to communicate,
[1:32:07.020 --> 1:32:11.500]  even if you don't have a future, always when governments take away speech, they then enslave
[1:32:11.500 --> 1:32:14.940]  the population and then they finally start exterminating the population.
[1:32:14.940 --> 1:32:19.380]  And America, the entire world is going down the tubes because the UN Global's directed
[1:32:19.380 --> 1:32:20.380]  great reset.
[1:32:20.380 --> 1:32:23.820]  That's why it's more important than ever that impful wars stay on the air and that all of
[1:32:23.820 --> 1:32:24.820]  us stay healthy.
[1:32:24.820 --> 1:32:29.380]  That's why I'm offering a bunch of our best selling products in 50% off for a limited
[1:32:29.380 --> 1:32:32.980]  time only until the end of the month of September.
[1:32:32.980 --> 1:32:36.820]  That's only about 12, 13 days as of the time we're taping this.
[1:32:36.820 --> 1:32:39.060]  And that means all of these amazing products.
[1:32:39.060 --> 1:32:42.380]  We have ultra 12, highest quality B12 taken out of the tongue.
[1:32:42.380 --> 1:32:46.300]  We have winter sun, highest quality organic vitamin D3 taken out of the tongue.

[1:32:48.300 --> 1:32:50.900]  We've got hair and beard formula that's got all the vitamins and minerals as well, not
[1:32:50.900 --> 1:32:51.900]  just your hair and beard.
[1:32:51.900 --> 1:32:57.140]  And we've got our great liquid turmeric formula all 50% off at infowarstore.com and it keeps
[1:32:57.140 --> 1:32:58.140]  us on the air.
[1:32:58.140 --> 1:33:03.220]  Take action and I thank you.
[1:33:03.220 --> 1:33:18.620]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:18.620 --> 1:33:19.620]  You found it.
[1:33:19.620 --> 1:33:21.820]  The tip of the spear.
[1:33:21.820 --> 1:33:27.540]  It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[1:33:27.540 --> 1:33:30.220]  All right.
[1:33:30.220 --> 1:33:31.860]  There is no way.
[1:33:31.860 --> 1:33:42.140]  I can get through all of this news before I'm joined by a doctor in studio, Dr. Brian
[1:33:42.140 --> 1:33:47.740]  Artis to, I guess, further get into this COVID stuff.
[1:33:47.740 --> 1:33:49.220]  So I'm thinking about maybe putting this off.
[1:33:49.220 --> 1:33:51.620]  The good news is I'm going to be hosting the war room today.
[1:33:51.620 --> 1:33:54.020]  So I've got three hours to cover it.
[1:33:54.020 --> 1:33:58.740]  So I think what I'm going to do here is I'm going to put this COVID news on hold for now
[1:33:58.740 --> 1:34:02.580]  because I'm sure we're going to be getting into it with the good doctor joining us here
[1:34:02.580 --> 1:34:04.620]  in 30 minutes in studio.
[1:34:04.620 --> 1:34:09.740]  So I'm going to put this stack of news on hold for the war room today.
[1:34:09.740 --> 1:34:13.340]  But then another part of me is like, I got to cover it now.
[1:34:13.340 --> 1:34:15.500]  It's just too big not to cover.
[1:34:15.500 --> 1:34:18.140]  But then the entire show ends up being about COVID and vaccine.
[1:34:18.140 --> 1:34:26.940]  So let me just push pause on that for now and get into the rest of this news that is developing.
[1:34:26.940 --> 1:34:32.820]  And let's start over here with the Durham indictment of Hillary Clinton's lawyer.
[1:34:32.820 --> 1:34:43.580]  Now, I understand in a way this is all irrelevant, but it's also not because it exposes how fake
[1:34:43.580 --> 1:34:50.340]  and corrupt the mainstream media is and how dumb people like Natasha Bertrand are.
[1:34:50.340 --> 1:34:51.340]  What's her name?
[1:34:51.340 --> 1:34:52.340]  Natasha Bertrand or Bertrand.
[1:34:52.340 --> 1:34:53.540]  She writes for the Atlantic.
[1:34:53.540 --> 1:34:57.860]  One of the biggest Russiagate hoaxers in the history of Russiagate, right up there with
[1:34:57.860 --> 1:35:04.900]  the CNN crews and the MSNBC crews, just totally falling for all the lies.
[1:35:04.900 --> 1:35:10.980]  And so what's come out in this indictment is quite stunning, actually.
[1:35:10.980 --> 1:35:16.500]  John Durham indictment shows Clinton likely worked with top Google executive to fabricate
[1:35:16.500 --> 1:35:18.500]  Russia hoax, says Google whistleblower.
[1:35:18.500 --> 1:35:22.820]  And in the indictment, it actually says, and the name isn't included in there, but it actually
[1:35:22.820 --> 1:35:28.140]  says a big tech executive was involved in this.
[1:35:28.140 --> 1:35:31.740]  A university was also involved in this.
[1:35:31.740 --> 1:35:38.740]  That said university was on the table for millions of dollars in research grants.
[1:35:38.740 --> 1:35:41.140]  You're connecting the dots here.
[1:35:41.140 --> 1:35:44.940]  So Hillary Clinton says, hey, go along with this hoax so that I can get into office.
[1:35:44.940 --> 1:35:48.540]  I get into office, you get your millions of dollars of research grants.
[1:35:48.540 --> 1:35:51.660]  Ah, you get the Google execs involved.
[1:35:51.660 --> 1:35:52.860]  You do the same thing with them.
[1:35:52.860 --> 1:35:55.860]  Hey, we'll give you, we'll give you legal protection.
[1:35:55.860 --> 1:35:57.140]  We'll give you a legal grant.
[1:35:57.140 --> 1:35:58.340]  Just go along with this hoax.
[1:35:58.340 --> 1:35:59.340]  Don't worry, Hillary will win.
[1:35:59.340 --> 1:36:00.340]  It'll be fine.
[1:36:00.340 --> 1:36:02.860]  Oh, they all got caught.
[1:36:02.860 --> 1:36:07.180]  And now you have Michael Sussman indicted.
[1:36:07.180 --> 1:36:11.020]  Is he going to sing like a canary?
[1:36:11.020 --> 1:36:14.060]  Or is he just going to take the charges?
[1:36:14.060 --> 1:36:19.340]  It's going to be an interesting thing to watch develop.
[1:36:19.340 --> 1:36:25.940]  But Hillary Clinton was caught working with the feds, working with lawyers, working with
[1:36:25.940 --> 1:36:30.780]  universities, working with big tech executives, fabricating the Russia hoax, and literally
[1:36:30.780 --> 1:36:37.980]  a fake news story folks, literally completely made up by Hillary Clinton and her cohorts
[1:36:37.980 --> 1:36:45.660]  in 2016 during the election cycle, completely made up the whole Russia gate phenomenon fake
[1:36:45.660 --> 1:36:49.380]  news story, all confirmed, totally made up.
[1:36:49.380 --> 1:36:53.180]  Do you get any apology from the mainstream news that lied to you?
[1:36:53.180 --> 1:36:57.900]  Do you get any apologies from Natasha Bertrand from the Atlantic who lied to you and went
[1:36:57.900 --> 1:37:02.540]  on TV every night telling you that Trump was working directly with Russia and had back
[1:37:02.540 --> 1:37:04.060]  channel ties to Russia?
[1:37:04.060 --> 1:37:05.740]  All lies, Natasha.
[1:37:05.740 --> 1:37:06.740]  Are you going to come out and apologize?
[1:37:06.740 --> 1:37:09.940]  Are you going to come out and admit that you were, you were fooled?
[1:37:09.940 --> 1:37:11.900]  No, I doubt it.
[1:37:11.900 --> 1:37:16.300]  Because you're a liar.
[1:37:16.300 --> 1:37:19.980]  The awards given to CNN for their Russia gate coverage, all a hoax.
[1:37:19.980 --> 1:37:21.980]  Are they going to apologize?
[1:37:21.980 --> 1:37:29.580]  No, you won't get any apologized as Glenn Greenwald points out quoting Hillary Clinton's
[1:37:29.580 --> 1:37:35.500]  tweet when all of this broke right before the election on October 31st entirely made
[1:37:35.500 --> 1:37:41.820]  up whole cloth by Hillary's campaign bribing other people to go along with the lie.
[1:37:41.820 --> 1:37:46.740]  Now we know it, stated by Glenn Greenwald, all four statements from this Hillary tweet
[1:37:46.740 --> 1:37:50.460]  eight days before the election, all four are complete lies.
[1:37:50.460 --> 1:37:54.780]  This scam was cooked up by her own campaign operatives then fed to her media servants
[1:37:54.780 --> 1:38:00.620]  who laundered it as she pretended she learned it from them.
[1:38:00.620 --> 1:38:02.580]  All made up, all a giant hoax.
[1:38:02.580 --> 1:38:03.580]  And here's why it's key.
[1:38:03.580 --> 1:38:04.580]  I get it.
[1:38:04.580 --> 1:38:05.580]  It's yesterday's news.
[1:38:05.580 --> 1:38:08.980]  It doesn't really impact anything maybe anymore except for these indictments that are rolling
[1:38:08.980 --> 1:38:13.100]  down and maybe there'll be some cooperation, maybe not.
[1:38:13.100 --> 1:38:16.140]  It just shows how the media lies about everything.
[1:38:16.140 --> 1:38:21.060]  It shows how politicians are involved, how big tech executives are involved, how universities
[1:38:21.060 --> 1:38:23.100]  are involved, how the media is involved.
[1:38:23.100 --> 1:38:25.260]  They're all involved.
[1:38:25.260 --> 1:38:31.500]  They're all involved lying to you, deceiving you, all because they want money and power.
[1:38:31.500 --> 1:38:35.020]  And Hillary Clinton is one of the worst ever.
[1:38:35.020 --> 1:38:41.580]  And she's been caught red-handed, hand in the cookie jar, crumbs all over her mouth,
[1:38:41.580 --> 1:38:47.700]  crumbs all over her blouse, crumbs all over the table, still eating the cookies, and she's
[1:38:47.700 --> 1:38:48.700]  been caught.
[1:38:48.700 --> 1:38:50.260]  And where is the media on any of this?
[1:38:50.260 --> 1:38:55.580]  Well, they're covering it up because they were involved in the big lie.
[1:38:55.580 --> 1:39:04.420]  As they are covering up the status of Joe Biden right now, who you can see riding a bike,
[1:39:04.420 --> 1:39:10.860]  he went on another vacation this weekend as the country deteriorates and consumer prices
[1:39:10.860 --> 1:39:11.860]  skyrocket.
[1:39:11.860 --> 1:39:13.260]  The border is wide open.
[1:39:13.260 --> 1:39:16.700]  We just murdered innocent children in Afghanistan.
[1:39:16.700 --> 1:39:20.820]  And Joe Biden is on an ice cream social bike ride.
[1:39:20.820 --> 1:39:26.420]  And there's videos, it's all a publicity stunt to prove that Biden, I guess, can ride a bike
[1:39:26.420 --> 1:39:28.140]  or whatever.
[1:39:28.140 --> 1:39:33.860]  And so, but you see him smiling as he's riding by the media like a five-year-old because
[1:39:33.860 --> 1:39:35.300]  that's his mental capacity.
[1:39:35.300 --> 1:39:39.620]  Joe Biden is essentially a five-year-old and he's riding a bike and it's just the greatest
[1:39:39.620 --> 1:39:41.980]  thing in the world for Joe.
[1:39:41.980 --> 1:39:43.540]  This is just the greatest enjoyment.
[1:39:43.540 --> 1:39:45.740]  He's in a five-year-old's mental state.
[1:39:45.740 --> 1:39:49.580]  It's all photo op, it's all a video op, it's all just a giant hoax.
[1:39:49.580 --> 1:39:52.420]  Oh, look at Joe, he can ride a bike.
[1:39:52.420 --> 1:39:53.420]  And Joe just doesn't know what's going on.
[1:39:53.420 --> 1:39:55.500]  He's just like a five-year-old that just got the training wheels off.
[1:39:55.500 --> 1:40:01.220]  He's just so excited to ride his bike around the neighborhood with his friends.
[1:40:01.220 --> 1:40:04.540]  But where's Joe Biden on this?
[1:40:04.540 --> 1:40:10.060]  Kabul Airport Suicide Bomber who murdered 13 Americans and wounded dozens of others was
[1:40:10.060 --> 1:40:16.140]  set free from Bagram Prison after Joe Biden abandoned the U.S. base in July.
[1:40:16.140 --> 1:40:21.540]  So the prisoners that were set free by the Biden administration at Bagram Air Force Base
[1:40:21.540 --> 1:40:23.580]  murdered Americans.
[1:40:23.580 --> 1:40:29.100]  And the prisoners that were traded for a deserter, Bo Bergdahl, that nobody actually was trying
[1:40:29.100 --> 1:40:32.580]  to get back because he deserted.
[1:40:32.580 --> 1:40:37.100]  And then the Taliban used him as a bargaining chip with Obama to free their prisoners.
[1:40:37.100 --> 1:40:39.780]  Obama traded five terrorists for one U.S. deserter.
[1:40:39.780 --> 1:40:41.740]  It was never about bringing Bo Bergdahl home.
[1:40:41.740 --> 1:40:43.620]  That was all fake news.
[1:40:43.620 --> 1:40:45.180]  Bo Bergdahl was already out there.
[1:40:45.180 --> 1:40:48.940]  He was used to the bargaining chip by the Taliban and Obama worked with the Taliban to
[1:40:48.940 --> 1:40:53.860]  free five of their top leaders who are now running Afghanistan.
[1:40:53.860 --> 1:40:59.220]  So the Biden administration freed prisoners from Kabul who ended up murdering American
[1:40:59.220 --> 1:41:07.620]  citizens and the Obama administration freed prisoners from Guantanamo Bay who are now
[1:41:07.620 --> 1:41:13.060]  running the regime in Afghanistan.
[1:41:13.060 --> 1:41:21.180]  And they still won't even comment on murdering seven children and three innocent civilians
[1:41:21.180 --> 1:41:25.860]  in Afghanistan with a drone strike authorized by Biden.
[1:41:25.860 --> 1:41:28.860]  And now they're just blaming the military for it when Biden is the one that made the
[1:41:28.860 --> 1:41:31.900]  call or maybe it was Millie who really knows at this point.
[1:41:31.900 --> 1:41:33.420]  They murdered children.
[1:41:33.420 --> 1:41:38.180]  Can you imagine if Trump launched a drone strike that murdered seven children?
[1:41:38.180 --> 1:41:39.180]  Can you imagine?
[1:41:39.180 --> 1:41:40.940]  Can you imagine what the media coverage would be like?
[1:41:40.940 --> 1:41:42.540]  Can you imagine what the headlines would be like?
[1:41:42.540 --> 1:41:44.660]  Can you imagine the cover of Time magazine?
[1:41:44.660 --> 1:41:46.700]  What that would be like?
[1:41:46.700 --> 1:41:50.860]  But Biden does it and there's crickets, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:41:50.860 --> 1:41:54.820]  This or as Elon Musk puts it.
[1:41:54.820 --> 1:41:59.300]  And by the way, there's a reason why the Biden administration is ignoring Elon Musk.
[1:41:59.300 --> 1:42:02.100]  He's still sleeping.
[1:42:02.100 --> 1:42:09.060]  Musk mocks Biden for ignoring SpaceX's historic all civilian orbital mission.
[1:42:09.060 --> 1:42:15.100]  In the wake of the inspiration for private orbital mission success, SpaceX CEO Elon
[1:42:15.100 --> 1:42:19.740]  Musk offered a snarky reply when asked why President Joe Biden was ignoring the feat
[1:42:19.740 --> 1:42:27.140]  when even his competitors had celebrated the achievement and Musk said he's still sleeping.
[1:42:27.140 --> 1:42:30.980]  But yeah, the Biden administration doesn't want to recognize Elon Musk because he's not
[1:42:30.980 --> 1:42:32.340]  for government tyranny.
[1:42:32.340 --> 1:42:34.820]  He's not for vaccine mandates.
[1:42:34.820 --> 1:42:36.340]  He's his own man.
[1:42:36.340 --> 1:42:40.060]  He doesn't want to be holding to any globalist forces.
[1:42:40.060 --> 1:42:41.700]  He's come out against the COVID tyranny.
[1:42:41.700 --> 1:42:43.980]  He's come out against the government tyranny.
[1:42:43.980 --> 1:42:50.840]  And you know, he is actually legitimately exploring space and innovating for the people.
[1:42:50.840 --> 1:42:54.860]  Not for the globalists, not for the elite, but for the people.
[1:42:54.860 --> 1:42:58.780]  So let's see if Elon Musk doesn't get more hardcore in the coming months or weeks or
[1:42:58.780 --> 1:42:59.780]  years.
[1:42:59.780 --> 1:43:03.500]  Finally, vitamin D3 and vitamin K that are both essential are getting the respect and
[1:43:03.500 --> 1:43:05.260]  the attention they deserve.
[1:43:05.260 --> 1:43:06.260]  We've got a great product.
[1:43:06.260 --> 1:43:08.580]  It's been out for six years, winter sun.
[1:43:08.580 --> 1:43:12.500]  Long before the big crisis came along, we were there saying, this is high quality.
[1:43:12.500 --> 1:43:13.500]  This will make you healthy.
[1:43:13.500 --> 1:43:15.020]  This will be better for you and your family.
[1:43:15.020 --> 1:43:19.820]  But what else doesn't get attention and needs to be looked at is vitamin B12.
[1:43:19.820 --> 1:43:20.820]  It is just as essential.
[1:43:20.820 --> 1:43:25.660]  It is just as important and it is amazing and it's not just about your immune system.
[1:43:25.660 --> 1:43:28.100]  It's about every part of your body.
[1:43:28.100 --> 1:43:33.020]  It's really a hormone and it's what your building blocks of your entire body operate
[1:43:33.020 --> 1:43:34.020]  off of.
[1:43:34.020 --> 1:43:36.380]  So these vitamins are essential.
[1:43:36.380 --> 1:43:40.980]  Vitamin D3 and of course vitamin B12 go together like a horse and carriage.
[1:43:40.980 --> 1:43:41.980]  Do your own research.
[1:43:41.980 --> 1:43:45.300]  We've got the highest grades you're going to find out there and they're taken under
[1:43:45.300 --> 1:43:46.300]  the tongue.
[1:43:46.300 --> 1:43:50.460]  It's key to put it under the tongue for about a minute and let it sit so your blood vessels
[1:43:50.460 --> 1:43:51.460]  absorb it.
[1:43:51.460 --> 1:43:57.820]  They're both available 50% off at mforestore.com together or by themselves at 50% off at 25%
[1:43:57.820 --> 1:43:58.820]  off.
[1:43:58.820 --> 1:44:03.540]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[1:44:03.540 --> 1:44:05.580]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[1:44:05.580 --> 1:44:11.300]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[1:44:11.300 --> 1:44:12.300]  We failed.
[1:44:12.300 --> 1:44:13.300]  Yes.
[1:44:13.300 --> 1:44:14.300]  A lot of people are awake.
[1:44:14.300 --> 1:44:15.300]  Yes.
[1:44:15.300 --> 1:44:19.500]  We're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[1:44:19.500 --> 1:44:21.900]  deindustrialization great reset.
[1:44:21.900 --> 1:44:26.180]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[1:44:26.180 --> 1:44:30.780]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[1:44:30.780 --> 1:44:34.100]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda and we've
[1:44:34.100 --> 1:44:37.900]  also got to get personally prepared and one of the number one things to do is high quality
[1:44:37.900 --> 1:44:43.620]  storeable food, you got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at mforestore.com.
[1:44:43.620 --> 1:44:47.620]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready
[1:44:47.620 --> 1:44:49.020]  to ship right now.
[1:44:49.020 --> 1:44:53.980]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits
[1:44:53.980 --> 1:44:56.460]  because believe me, serious times are coming.
[1:44:56.460 --> 1:45:00.140]  Get ready at mforestore.com.
[1:45:00.140 --> 1:45:03.540]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[1:45:03.540 --> 1:45:07.740]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[1:45:07.740 --> 1:45:10.980]  But let me tell you, the new world order is breathing down our neck.
[1:45:10.980 --> 1:45:14.060]  The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they
[1:45:14.060 --> 1:45:15.380]  can to shut us down.
[1:45:15.380 --> 1:45:19.700]  So please pray to keep info wars on the air and please support the local station you're
[1:45:19.700 --> 1:45:20.700]  listening to as well.
[1:45:20.700 --> 1:45:26.780]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film,
[1:45:26.780 --> 1:45:31.700]  get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[1:45:31.700 --> 1:45:33.180]  in the face of this thing.
[1:45:33.180 --> 1:45:35.300]  I need your help more than ever now.
[1:45:35.300 --> 1:45:39.660]  I want to keep fighting the globalist, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[1:45:39.660 --> 1:45:45.020]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great

[1:47:33.980 --> 1:47:41.660]  And the legend continues, ladies and gentlemen, the legend of info wars.
[1:47:41.660 --> 1:47:51.460]  Here we are still live, 20 plus years fighting the globalist, I'm going on 6 years here myself
[1:47:51.460 --> 1:47:57.580]  and what an honor and a privilege it is to have this audience and have this platform
[1:47:57.580 --> 1:48:02.620]  and still be live despite all the attacks against us, which are just far reaching, you
[1:48:02.620 --> 1:48:07.100]  know most of it and the censorship as well.
[1:48:07.100 --> 1:48:12.740]  Let's get into this stack of news over here, again we have a renowned doctor joining us
[1:48:12.740 --> 1:48:20.020]  coming up, Dr. Brian Artist in studio and we'll just get into the latest with COVID and the
[1:48:20.020 --> 1:48:24.460]  vaccines and everything, you know, it'll echo everything else you've heard from all the
[1:48:24.460 --> 1:48:28.940]  great doctors we've had on here live discussing this with the mainstream media won't tell
[1:48:28.940 --> 1:48:34.140]  you because they're owned by big pharma, kind of like our politicians.
[1:48:34.140 --> 1:48:39.220]  But let's look at some of these other stories developing.
[1:48:39.220 --> 1:48:44.540]  From the national file, George Soros funds the Bush Clinton Obama group pushing for Afghan
[1:48:44.540 --> 1:48:49.020]  migrants, former presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama and failed presidential candidate
[1:48:49.020 --> 1:48:53.620]  Hillary Clinton are serving as honorary co-chairs of an organization to support the welcoming
[1:48:53.620 --> 1:48:58.100]  of Afghan migrants into the United States of America following the U.S. defeat to the
[1:48:58.100 --> 1:49:00.780]  Taliban and failed evacuation.
[1:49:00.780 --> 1:49:07.580]  The organization welcomes welcome.us is funded by socialist billionaire George Soros's Open
[1:49:07.580 --> 1:49:16.460]  Society Foundations as the late great George Carlin said, it's a big club and you ain't
[1:49:16.460 --> 1:49:17.460]  in it.
[1:49:17.460 --> 1:49:25.100]  By the way, Jason Whitlock, who's also a TV show host, I believe it was, he was a guest
[1:49:25.100 --> 1:49:31.060]  on either Tucker, or maybe it was Cudlow, I'm just all the media I'm consuming is merging
[1:49:31.060 --> 1:49:32.660]  in my brain.
[1:49:32.660 --> 1:49:37.540]  He went on and called Joy Reid a satanic priestess of the New World Order.
[1:49:37.540 --> 1:49:43.660]  Folks, that's like mainstream media people now saying this stuff.
[1:49:43.660 --> 1:49:46.020]  Wow.
[1:49:46.020 --> 1:49:49.780]  And of course, you have Nicki Minaj going up against Joy Reid as well.
[1:49:49.780 --> 1:49:55.020]  But that's just more to the it's a big club and you ain't in it.
[1:49:55.020 --> 1:50:00.700]  New video at infowars.com invasion force of tens of thousands of Haitians heading towards
[1:50:00.700 --> 1:50:01.700]  southern border.
[1:50:01.700 --> 1:50:04.660]  So it's, it's, you know, it's like 30,000 plus now.
[1:50:04.660 --> 1:50:05.660]  Yeah, there it is.
[1:50:05.660 --> 1:50:10.500]  Jason Whitlock put it back on Jason Whitlock stated Joy Reid was a satanic priestess in
[1:50:10.500 --> 1:50:19.940]  the alphabet cult, here's the thing though, Joy Reid doesn't have near enough power.
[1:50:19.940 --> 1:50:24.460]  See, she's like, she's like in the back room during these things.
[1:50:24.460 --> 1:50:32.260]  The real the real ones are Marina Abramovich and such, but I'm digressing Biden regime
[1:50:32.260 --> 1:50:37.460]  processing Haitian family units in Del Rio and releasing them into the United States.
[1:50:37.460 --> 1:50:40.980]  No vaccine mandates, no testing, just come on in.
[1:50:40.980 --> 1:50:43.100]  We got a wide open country.
[1:50:43.100 --> 1:50:48.780]  Biden has surrendered the U.S. to the New World Order to the globalists.
[1:50:48.780 --> 1:50:51.900]  And this is what's really going on here.
[1:50:51.900 --> 1:50:56.100]  This is just wild stuff, wild images and videos coming out of the southern border.
[1:50:56.100 --> 1:50:59.300]  They're now lassoing up the illegal border crossers.
[1:50:59.300 --> 1:51:02.540]  I'm just just unbelievable.
[1:51:02.540 --> 1:51:06.900]  Just scenes from a third world hellholes, scenes from a dystopian science fiction movie
[1:51:06.900 --> 1:51:08.780]  all down at our southern border.
[1:51:08.780 --> 1:51:14.340]  And this is what it comes down to Senate parliamentarian kills Democrat bid to shoehorn
[1:51:14.340 --> 1:51:18.420]  eight million green cards into $3.5 trillion spending bill.
[1:51:18.420 --> 1:51:20.780]  This is from zero hedge.
[1:51:20.780 --> 1:51:25.580]  And so we've known that this is the plan by the Democrats by Biden.
[1:51:25.580 --> 1:51:28.020]  Bring in as many illegal immigrants as possible.
[1:51:28.020 --> 1:51:31.020]  We're looking at about Alex thinks it's about eight to 10 million.
[1:51:31.020 --> 1:51:33.300]  I'm maybe a little on the lower side of that.
[1:51:33.300 --> 1:51:35.540]  He's usually right when we have these debates.
[1:51:35.540 --> 1:51:41.900]  I believe it's going to be about five to seven million illegal immigrants entering this year.
[1:51:41.900 --> 1:51:47.660]  But either way, the goal is green cards and then amnesty and then voting blocks and then
[1:51:47.660 --> 1:51:52.780]  turn Texas blue and then forget about ever having a free country again.
[1:51:52.780 --> 1:51:56.900]  Newsome signs housing bills that limit single family zoning.
[1:51:56.900 --> 1:52:00.500]  Advocacy group says law will help narrow racial wealth gap in California.
[1:52:00.500 --> 1:52:01.660]  So this is the second part.
[1:52:01.660 --> 1:52:08.020]  So first it is bring them all in, then it is make them all citizens, then it is flood
[1:52:08.020 --> 1:52:13.420]  suburban America with these people to just completely destroy it because they've already
[1:52:13.420 --> 1:52:14.700]  destroyed the inner cities.
[1:52:14.700 --> 1:52:19.140]  See when America was booming, you wanted to live in the inner city.
[1:52:19.140 --> 1:52:20.820]  You wanted to live downtown.
[1:52:20.820 --> 1:52:27.980]  You had great public transport or you could walk or whatever was going on.
[1:52:27.980 --> 1:52:29.580]  It was safe.
[1:52:29.580 --> 1:52:30.580]  You had good schools.
[1:52:30.580 --> 1:52:33.740]  Well, then the Democrats got in charge and all that went to hell.
[1:52:33.740 --> 1:52:38.940]  Now inner cities are the most crime-ridden impoverished parts of the land of the United
[1:52:38.940 --> 1:52:41.420]  States of America.
[1:52:41.420 --> 1:52:52.140]  So now they want to import that poverty, import that degeneracy, import that destruction,
[1:52:52.140 --> 1:52:55.060]  import that criminality into the suburbs.
[1:52:55.060 --> 1:52:58.380]  So now it's, hey, most people, once you get a family, you want to get out of the cities
[1:52:58.380 --> 1:53:03.100]  because it's the most criminal impoverished areas of America to live in.
[1:53:03.100 --> 1:53:05.860]  Well, now the Democrats, they have a solution for that.
[1:53:05.860 --> 1:53:10.020]  They're going to bring in eight million illegal immigrants, make them citizens, and then build
[1:53:10.020 --> 1:53:14.820]  housing projects in the American suburbs.
[1:53:14.820 --> 1:53:15.980]  See how that works?
[1:53:15.980 --> 1:53:20.980]  It's all the Democrat plans, Coward and Pliven, Agenda 21.
[1:53:20.980 --> 1:53:21.980]  You name it.
[1:53:21.980 --> 1:53:22.980]  This is what they're doing.
[1:53:22.980 --> 1:53:28.700]  They globalist takeover to destroy America into a one-world government.
[1:53:28.700 --> 1:53:30.980]  And if you don't like it, you're a racist, don't you know?
[1:53:30.980 --> 1:53:35.180]  Paul finds that more white than black people want police to abolish in Minneapolis.
[1:53:35.180 --> 1:53:45.300]  Oh, by the way, the bill, the bill that was written by Ilhan Omar to defund and abolish
[1:53:45.300 --> 1:53:47.220]  the police in Minnesota, guess what?
[1:53:47.220 --> 1:53:48.700]  She scrapped it.
[1:53:48.700 --> 1:53:49.700]  Yeah.
[1:53:49.700 --> 1:53:50.700]  She scrapped it.
[1:53:50.700 --> 1:53:57.180]  She figured this one out before she did, that it's actually black people that deal with
[1:53:57.180 --> 1:54:01.460]  crime living in Minneapolis that want the police.
[1:54:01.460 --> 1:54:03.460]  Go figure.
[1:54:03.460 --> 1:54:04.800]  Go figure.
[1:54:04.800 --> 1:54:09.740]  People that live in these cities that happen to be black don't want to see their cities
[1:54:09.740 --> 1:54:13.940]  and areas overwhelmed with criminals and violence.
[1:54:13.940 --> 1:54:14.940]  Who would have thought?
[1:54:14.940 --> 1:54:18.900]  I guess Ilhan Omar just figured that one out.
[1:54:18.900 --> 1:54:22.780]  This is just news of the hilarious now.
[1:54:22.780 --> 1:54:27.380]  The videos at info wars.com, the stories by Steve Watson.
[1:54:27.380 --> 1:54:35.580]  Driver tells eco protesters blocking motorway, motorway, you are causing more pollution.
[1:54:35.580 --> 1:54:37.180]  It's the extinction rebellion.
[1:54:37.180 --> 1:54:41.340]  By the way, AOC came out today and said we have 12 years left to live.
[1:54:41.340 --> 1:54:45.380]  I will bet, I mean, what should I bet?
[1:54:45.380 --> 1:54:54.700]  My head, my legs, my male member, I will bet everything that the earth is not going to
[1:54:54.700 --> 1:54:59.980]  cease to exist, humanity is not going to cease to exist because of man-made climate change
[1:54:59.980 --> 1:55:01.500]  in 12 years.
[1:55:01.500 --> 1:55:06.660]  Do you understand that politicians and media, more recently the Democrats, but politicians
[1:55:06.660 --> 1:55:12.620]  and media have been telling you that climate or weather was going to end the planet for
[1:55:12.620 --> 1:55:13.620]  100 years?
[1:55:13.620 --> 1:55:14.620]  100 years.
[1:55:14.620 --> 1:55:16.660]  They have been doing this.
[1:55:16.660 --> 1:55:22.500]  And I say that, I did a report, I don't remember how long ago, on the war room where we documented
[1:55:22.500 --> 1:55:27.860]  how in the 20s they said an ice age was going to kill us all and then in the 30s it was
[1:55:27.860 --> 1:55:35.980]  a flood and then in the 70s it was acid rain and then in the 80s it was an ice age and
[1:55:35.980 --> 1:55:41.420]  then in the 90s it was a flood and then in the 2000s it was global warming and now here
[1:55:41.420 --> 1:55:44.980]  you are, it's just climate change, it's just, overall just climate change is going to kill
[1:55:44.980 --> 1:55:45.980]  all of us.
[1:55:45.980 --> 1:55:50.020]  It's always 10 years to live, it's always we're all doomed, we're all dead and then
[1:55:50.020 --> 1:55:54.260]  somehow we're all still here and it's kind of like the weatherman who always gets things
[1:55:54.260 --> 1:55:56.980]  wrong, I'm not saying the weatherman is bad, it's hard to predict the weather, but the
[1:55:56.980 --> 1:56:00.980]  point is most people know the weatherman usually not going to get the weather right
[1:56:00.980 --> 1:56:05.860]  and that's fine, but these people want to actually dictate policy off of their lies.
[1:56:05.860 --> 1:56:10.220]  Yeah, there's the 80s with Leonard Nimoy telling you that an ice age is inevitable and we're
[1:56:10.220 --> 1:56:12.740]  all going to be dead by the year 2000.
[1:56:12.740 --> 1:56:18.740]  They just had to remove at a glacier park, I believe it was in Alaska, a sign that said
[1:56:18.740 --> 1:56:23.460]  by the year 2020 all these glaciers will be melted, well you can still go to that glacier
[1:56:23.460 --> 1:56:30.460]  park and guess what, they're all still there and so they had to take the sign down.
[1:56:30.460 --> 1:56:35.860]  But hey, according to one of the dumbest people to ever serve in Congress, if not the dumbest,
[1:56:35.860 --> 1:56:40.420]  Alexander Ocasio-Cortez were all dead in 12 years due to weather, so planned accordingly
[1:56:40.420 --> 1:56:45.860]  I guess, but see that's just all nonsense and hilarious until they actually want to
[1:56:45.860 --> 1:56:51.260]  write policy and take away all of your individual liberties and civil liberties and freedoms
[1:56:51.260 --> 1:56:55.980]  and rights in the name of weather as if they can stop the weather.
[1:56:55.980 --> 1:57:00.700]  But then they actually have weather machines and weather modification programs that are
[1:57:00.700 --> 1:57:06.620]  run and made by men that they never even talk about, perhaps, I don't even know if you would
[1:57:06.620 --> 1:57:12.100]  call that hypocrisy, what would you even call that, irony, I mean it's maybe the greatest
[1:57:12.100 --> 1:57:18.620]  irony in our history that they talk about man-made climate change all day long, like
[1:57:18.620 --> 1:57:24.260]  it's going to kill us, but they don't actually talk about weather weapons and weather modification
[1:57:24.260 --> 1:57:29.140]  that's all public information now and China and Russia and Saudi Arabia and Qatar and
[1:57:29.140 --> 1:57:33.620]  all these other countries admit that they make weather, the U.S. government admits that
[1:57:33.620 --> 1:57:38.180]  they make water, I've been to their meetings, I've sat in their meetings where they talk
[1:57:38.180 --> 1:57:43.220]  about how they manipulate weather in Texas and then I'm told I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[1:57:43.220 --> 1:57:47.540]  Alright, more news coming up on the other side of this break, don't go anywhere.
[1:57:47.540 --> 1:57:59.380]  59 years old in good health, I'm not working in the front line, so my type is not recommended
[1:57:59.380 --> 1:58:01.380]  to get vaccinated.
[1:58:01.380 --> 1:58:07.580]  That was the current CEO of Pfizer just a few months ago on a national TV interview
[1:58:07.580 --> 1:58:16.060]  saying, oh he doesn't need to take the so-called MRNA, Maxine Australia gene therapy, he said
[1:58:16.060 --> 1:58:19.940]  you know he's 57 years old, he's healthy, he doesn't need it, it's at risk people,
[1:58:19.940 --> 1:58:25.100]  but that's not what it's PR firms that have bought off the politicians over 100 countries
[1:58:25.100 --> 1:58:30.260]  say, they say you've got to take it to have a job or leave your house or get on a plane
[1:58:30.260 --> 1:58:34.700]  or a train or even get outside your home for one hour a day if you live in Australia.
[1:58:34.700 --> 1:58:39.780]  So remember, the White House is exempt, Congress and their staff are exempt, the Postal Service
[1:58:39.780 --> 1:58:44.580]  is exempt, all these big corporate heads are exempt, they're not taking their poison vaccine,
[1:58:44.580 --> 1:58:49.740]  they're pushing it on you, wake up folks, wake up.
[1:58:49.740 --> 1:58:56.540]  In late August, Info War saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[1:58:56.540 --> 1:59:02.020]  that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause
[1:59:02.020 --> 1:59:06.020]  an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[1:59:06.020 --> 1:59:09.260]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to
[1:59:09.260 --> 1:59:12.920]  have, it's a check box that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with
[1:59:12.920 --> 1:59:17.060]  water filtration, self-defense and a relationship with God.
[1:59:17.060 --> 1:59:21.420]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in now, we're ready to
[1:59:21.420 --> 1:59:26.020]  ship to you within 24 hours of your order, it's high quality, it's very, very low cost

[1:59:31.420 --> 1:59:35.220]  and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[1:59:35.220 --> 1:59:41.500]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the Info War at infowarstore.com.
[1:59:41.500 --> 1:59:45.380]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their
[1:59:45.380 --> 1:59:46.380]  control.
[1:59:46.380 --> 1:59:53.580]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[1:59:53.580 --> 2:00:23.500]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:23.500 --> 2:00:28.700]  Currently at a Leander, Texas school district meeting, parents railed against the Marxist
[2:00:28.700 --> 2:00:32.020]  Filth passing his literature for high school students.
[2:00:32.020 --> 2:00:37.020]  Last week I asked my children if I could check the books that they picked up from the school.
[2:00:37.020 --> 2:00:42.020]  My son picked up this brand new book from the shelves and called us Long Boy.
[2:00:42.020 --> 2:00:46.180]  He was under the impression it was about a kid that ends up with a baby getting mowing
[2:00:46.180 --> 2:00:47.180]  the grass at Disneyland.
[2:00:47.180 --> 2:00:50.180]  I'd like to share a few quotes with you.
[2:00:50.180 --> 2:00:55.180]  On page 19, month that it really matters in 4th grade, at a church youth group meeting
[2:00:55.180 --> 2:01:00.180]  out in the bushes, I touched Doug Goble's s*** and he touched mine.
[2:01:00.180 --> 2:01:04.180]  In fact, there was even some mouths involved.
[2:01:04.180 --> 2:01:09.180]  What sort of diversity are you intending to teach my child with material like this?
[2:01:09.180 --> 2:01:14.180]  At this point, I need you to know that according to policy, FFH, local sexual harassment is
[2:01:14.180 --> 2:01:19.180]  defined as someone with sexual advances, sexually motivated and verbal, non-verbal
[2:01:19.180 --> 2:01:24.180]  conduct or other conduct or communication of a sexual nature when the conduct is so
[2:01:24.180 --> 2:01:28.180]  severe, persistent or pervasive that it affects the student's ability to participate.
[2:01:28.180 --> 2:01:34.180]  In Ohio, Hudson Mayor Craig Schubert told all five local school board members to resign
[2:01:34.180 --> 2:01:39.180]  during a board meeting or face charges over class material he described as child pornography.
[2:01:39.180 --> 2:01:44.180]  My name is Craig Schubert, I'm the mayor of this city.
[2:01:44.180 --> 2:01:51.180]  It has come to my attention that your educators are distributing essentially what is child
[2:01:51.180 --> 2:01:54.180]  pornography in the classroom.
[2:01:54.180 --> 2:01:57.180]  I've spoken to a judge this evening.
[2:01:57.180 --> 2:02:00.180]  She's already confirmed that.
[2:02:00.180 --> 2:02:03.180]  So I'm going to give you a simple choice.
[2:02:03.180 --> 2:02:08.180]  You either choose to resign from this board of education or you will be charged.
[2:02:08.180 --> 2:02:10.180]  Thank you.
[2:02:10.180 --> 2:02:14.180]  What a sex scene you wouldn't show your mom.
[2:02:14.180 --> 2:02:17.180]  Rewrite the sex scene from above into one that you'd let your mom read.
[2:02:17.180 --> 2:02:21.180]  Describe your favorite part of a man's body using only verbs.
[2:02:21.180 --> 2:02:27.180]  Those are some of the writing prompts found inside this book, 642 things to write about.
[2:02:27.180 --> 2:02:32.180]  And up until Monday, that book was being used by students in Hudson's high school senior
[2:02:32.180 --> 2:02:34.180]  college credit plus writing class.
[2:02:34.180 --> 2:02:39.180]  Do not sexualize our kids.
[2:02:39.180 --> 2:02:42.180]  The raw filth.
[2:02:42.180 --> 2:02:53.180]  The raw filth that snuck past the gatekeeping functions of this board of ed in 642 reasons
[2:02:53.180 --> 2:02:54.180]  was disgusting.
[2:02:54.180 --> 2:02:58.180]  The students were told not to take the book home.
[2:02:58.180 --> 2:02:59.180]  Why?
[2:02:59.180 --> 2:03:00.180]  So their parents couldn't see it.
[2:03:00.180 --> 2:03:03.180]  We don't know what is being said to our kids.
[2:03:03.180 --> 2:03:07.180]  I demand that there be cameras in the classrooms.
[2:03:07.180 --> 2:03:12.180]  When the Hudson school board arrogantly continued to promote Marxist pedophilia,
[2:03:12.180 --> 2:03:15.180]  indoctrination, they were served.
[2:03:15.180 --> 2:03:17.180]  Oh, yeah.
[2:03:17.180 --> 2:03:20.180]  Nicole Meacher was set in the left-hand field for Gulliver.
[2:03:20.180 --> 2:03:25.180]  For those watching, those were, you're the board president, correct?
[2:03:25.180 --> 2:03:28.180]  Had mentioned those were the court papers that are being served.
[2:03:28.180 --> 2:03:33.180]  The Marxist indoctrination of America's future can no longer be ignored.
[2:03:33.180 --> 2:03:38.180]  Public and private schools can both be sued for a variety of violations.
[2:03:38.180 --> 2:03:44.180]  Northern California, the entire Oakley Union school district board has resigned after bashing
[2:03:44.180 --> 2:03:46.180]  parents before a virtual school board meeting.
[2:03:46.180 --> 2:03:50.180]  The members were responding to complaints from parents over distance learning.
[2:03:50.180 --> 2:03:55.180]  If you're going to call me out, I'm going to fuck you up.
[2:03:55.180 --> 2:03:58.180]  Sorry, that's just me.
[2:03:58.180 --> 2:04:04.180]  Wow. Well, that was just one of the comments made by the school board members during the eight-minute conversation earlier this week.
[2:04:04.180 --> 2:04:07.180]  A new reaction today to this controversy.
[2:04:07.180 --> 2:04:13.180]  The district says that the social media posts, the personal posts from this teacher caused alarm and concern.
[2:04:13.180 --> 2:04:18.180]  Regarding saluting the American flag, it's prompted a district investigation,
[2:04:18.180 --> 2:04:24.180]  a visible showing of patriotism around the school, and the teacher has been removed from the classroom.
[2:04:24.180 --> 2:04:30.180]  My kid today goes, hey, it's kind of weird that we just stand and then, you know, we say it to nothing.
[2:04:30.180 --> 2:04:31.180]  And I'm like, oh, wow.
[2:04:31.180 --> 2:04:35.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, you can find the full John Bowne report at band.video.
[2:04:35.180 --> 2:04:38.180]  We must take our schools back from Marxism.
[2:04:38.180 --> 2:04:43.180]  Now, coming up, you need to tell everyone we're live right now with Dr. Brian Artis,
[2:04:43.180 --> 2:04:45.180]  because I was just discussing what we're going to get into.
[2:04:45.180 --> 2:04:46.180]  This is so key.
[2:04:46.180 --> 2:04:51.180]  It defeats the entire medical tyranny and COVID fear mongering if we can get this to go viral.
[2:04:51.180 --> 2:04:55.180]  So tell everybody to tune in, band.video, freeworldnews.tv.
[2:04:55.180 --> 2:05:24.180]  Dr. Brian Artis breaks it all down coming up.
[2:05:25.180 --> 2:05:29.180]  We're offering a bunch of our best selling products at 50% off for a limited time,
[2:05:29.180 --> 2:05:32.180]  only until the end of the month of September.
[2:05:32.180 --> 2:05:36.180]  That's only about 12, 13 days as of the time we're taping this.
[2:05:36.180 --> 2:05:38.180]  And that means all of these amazing products.
[2:05:38.180 --> 2:05:41.180]  We have ultra 12, highest quality B12 taken out of the tongue.
[2:05:41.180 --> 2:05:45.180]  We have winter sun, highest quality organic vitamin D3 taken out of the tongue.
[2:05:45.180 --> 2:05:46.180]  Amazing.
[2:05:46.180 --> 2:05:47.180]  We've got knock out the sleep babe.
[2:05:47.180 --> 2:05:50.180]  We've got hair and beard formula that's got all the vitamins and minerals as well,
[2:05:50.180 --> 2:05:51.180]  not just hair and beard.
[2:05:51.180 --> 2:05:54.180]  And we've got our great liquid turmeric formula all 50% off
[2:05:54.180 --> 2:05:56.180]  at infowarstore.com.
[2:05:56.180 --> 2:05:57.180]  And it keeps us on the air.
[2:05:57.180 --> 2:05:58.180]  Take action.
[2:05:58.180 --> 2:06:09.180]  And I thank you.
[2:06:09.180 --> 2:06:10.180]  All right.
[2:06:10.180 --> 2:06:11.180]  You found it.
[2:06:11.180 --> 2:06:12.180]  Yeah, you have.
[2:06:12.180 --> 2:06:17.180]  It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[2:06:17.180 --> 2:06:18.180]  So here's the thing.
[2:06:18.180 --> 2:06:25.180]  If we're sporing this at an aggregate, I've seen maybe you've got Dr. Fauci and then the
[2:06:25.180 --> 2:06:30.180]  same two or three doctors that go on all the mainstream news television shows telling
[2:06:30.180 --> 2:06:32.180]  you, oh, the vaccine in the mask.
[2:06:32.180 --> 2:06:33.180]  That's it.
[2:06:33.180 --> 2:06:34.180]  Vaccine and mask.
[2:06:34.180 --> 2:06:35.180]  There's nothing else out there.
[2:06:35.180 --> 2:06:38.180]  Only a vaccine, only a mask, nothing else.
[2:06:38.180 --> 2:06:41.180]  Live in fear of COVID and, you know, become a slave to medical tyranny.
[2:06:41.180 --> 2:06:43.180]  And all that you have is the vaccine in the mask.
[2:06:43.180 --> 2:06:48.180]  It's maybe two or three doctors that go on TV telling you that and then you have Dr.
[2:06:48.180 --> 2:06:49.180]  Fauci telling you that.
[2:06:49.180 --> 2:06:54.180]  Well, we've had dozens of doctors here live on the show that are telling you, hey, there's
[2:06:54.180 --> 2:06:55.180]  other options out there.
[2:06:55.180 --> 2:06:56.180]  Hey, there's other studies.
[2:06:56.180 --> 2:06:57.180]  Hey, there's other research.
[2:06:57.180 --> 2:06:59.180]  Hey, you don't have to live in fear.
[2:06:59.180 --> 2:07:06.180]  And so on an aggregate level, it's like 300, 400, 500 doctors to like five, but they're
[2:07:06.180 --> 2:07:10.180]  able to penetrate the mainstream consciousness because they're able to get on mainstream
[2:07:10.180 --> 2:07:11.180]  news.
[2:07:11.180 --> 2:07:14.180]  And so I've got another great doctor here, Dr. Brian Artis.
[2:07:14.180 --> 2:07:17.180]  The DrArtisShow.com is where you can find more on him.
[2:07:17.180 --> 2:07:20.180]  And I guess that his own coverage of this.
[2:07:20.180 --> 2:07:24.180]  And every time there's a new flavor, there's a new element, there's a new breaking news
[2:07:24.180 --> 2:07:25.180]  story they bring to me.
[2:07:25.180 --> 2:07:30.180]  And he is fired up today because he's sick and tired of doctors and lawyers saying that
[2:07:30.180 --> 2:07:34.180]  there is no ivermectin approved use for COVID.
[2:07:34.180 --> 2:07:36.180]  Well, that's just a flat out lie.
[2:07:36.180 --> 2:07:40.180]  He brings to me the actual NIH website document right here.
[2:07:40.180 --> 2:07:44.180]  So Dr. Artis, where do you want to begin with this?
[2:07:44.180 --> 2:07:46.180]  This should shut the whole thing down.
[2:07:46.180 --> 2:07:48.180]  But I guess let's start with it like this.
[2:07:48.180 --> 2:07:54.180]  As a doctor that's done the research for yourself that finds the NIH says that ivermectin is
[2:07:54.180 --> 2:07:56.180]  approved use, what does it mean to you?
[2:07:56.180 --> 2:08:01.180]  What does it represent to you that you can't even get a word and edgewise on mainstream
[2:08:01.180 --> 2:08:02.180]  news.
[2:08:02.180 --> 2:08:04.180]  You have all the mainstream media demonizing ivermectin.
[2:08:04.180 --> 2:08:06.180]  They tell you it's only for horses.
[2:08:06.180 --> 2:08:08.180]  They tell you that people are overdosing on it.
[2:08:08.180 --> 2:08:09.180]  That's all lies.
[2:08:09.180 --> 2:08:14.180]  Before we even get into the health aspect of that, what does that represent to you that
[2:08:14.180 --> 2:08:17.180]  they don't want people to know about ivermectin?
[2:08:17.180 --> 2:08:19.180]  Well, it's obviously they don't want them to know about ivermectin.
[2:08:19.180 --> 2:08:23.180]  Number one reason would be is it's an option that's actually been proven in 61 studies
[2:08:23.180 --> 2:08:28.180]  around the world to be effective at stopping the disease process of SARS-CoV-2, which they
[2:08:28.180 --> 2:08:30.180]  call COVID-19.
[2:08:30.180 --> 2:08:36.180]  And within two days it actually reduces transmission of COVID-19 even to loved ones in households.
[2:08:36.180 --> 2:08:38.180]  That's how many studies have been spread?
[2:08:38.180 --> 2:08:39.180]  Yes.
[2:08:39.180 --> 2:08:41.180]  And the actual vaccines have never been promoted to even do that.
[2:08:41.180 --> 2:08:45.180]  They actually state these do not prevent you from getting COVID-19 and they do not prevent
[2:08:45.180 --> 2:08:46.180]  you from transmitting it.
[2:08:46.180 --> 2:08:51.180]  It only reduces the possibility you might be hospitalized for a future infection.
[2:08:51.180 --> 2:08:56.180]  So what happens when you're either dealing with other doctors or media or lawyers and
[2:08:56.180 --> 2:09:00.180]  they tell you ivermectin is not approved used for COVID?
[2:09:00.180 --> 2:09:06.180]  I'm super excited to be on this show right now to actually expose your audience to some
[2:09:06.180 --> 2:09:11.180]  of this information and lies that are being told to all the loved ones of individuals who
[2:09:11.180 --> 2:09:14.180]  are being treated in ICUs currently for COVID-19.
[2:09:14.180 --> 2:09:19.180]  There are plenty of us out there educating you on the fact that early treatment is best.
[2:09:19.180 --> 2:09:23.180]  Hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin are safe and effective against SARS-CoV-2 infections.
[2:09:23.180 --> 2:09:29.180]  But still doctors and ICUs around America are continuing to tell my audience members,
[2:09:29.180 --> 2:09:33.180]  when they say do not treat them with remdesivir, we want you to treat them with ivermectin.
[2:09:33.180 --> 2:09:38.180]  This is what's being said to them every day and I get thousands of emails with this reply.
[2:09:38.180 --> 2:09:44.180]  All doctors are stating ivermectin is not an approved treatment drug for COVID-19.
[2:09:44.180 --> 2:09:49.180]  Now I have heard this now for a year and a half, but just three days ago I happened to
[2:09:49.180 --> 2:09:51.180]  uncover, you want to go ahead and get into this?
[2:09:51.180 --> 2:09:53.180]  No, this is the key element right here.
[2:09:53.180 --> 2:09:59.180]  So anybody that tells you that ivermectin is not approved used for COVID, you show them this.
[2:09:59.180 --> 2:10:04.180]  Yes, so there's a chart and I asked you guys to put it up on the website, put up the actual link
[2:10:04.180 --> 2:10:07.180]  and then also show the chart, so I hope you're showing it.
[2:10:07.180 --> 2:10:10.180]  There is a chart on NIH.gov's website.
[2:10:10.180 --> 2:10:15.180]  It was actually updated July 8th, 2021.
[2:10:15.180 --> 2:10:23.180]  The table is titled Table 2e, Characteristics of Antiviral Agents that Are Approved or Under Evaluation
[2:10:23.180 --> 2:10:25.180]  for the Treatment of COVID-19.
[2:10:25.180 --> 2:10:30.180]  This is the NIH.gov, do you know who put in the mandated Remdesivir treatment protocol
[2:10:30.180 --> 2:10:32.180]  starting in May 1st, 2020?
[2:10:32.180 --> 2:10:33.180]  What organization?
[2:10:33.180 --> 2:10:35.180]  I'm guessing it was the NIH.
[2:10:35.180 --> 2:10:37.180]  It was the NIH and Anthony Fauci.
[2:10:37.180 --> 2:10:42.180]  I'm pretty sure Fauci has a direct investment in Remdesivir, whatever it's called.
[2:10:42.180 --> 2:10:45.180]  Remdesivir, it rhymes with on the drive down here to the studio.
[2:10:45.180 --> 2:10:52.180]  I want to make a shirt that says Remdesivir, pronounced are near death.
[2:10:52.180 --> 2:10:57.180]  Which by the way, you have a tie of that into what's going on in the hospitals as well.
[2:10:57.180 --> 2:11:00.180]  Your death is near is how you actually state Remdesivir.
[2:11:00.180 --> 2:11:02.180]  Your death is near.
[2:11:02.180 --> 2:11:04.180]  Remdesivir, your death is near.
[2:11:04.180 --> 2:11:09.180]  All right, so Anthony Fauci in May 1st, 2020 puts out this mandate, NIH.gov,
[2:11:09.180 --> 2:11:14.180]  that Remdesivir is the only treatment option for COVID-19 throughout all of America.
[2:11:14.180 --> 2:11:17.180]  Hydroxychloroquine is bad, you can't use it, chloroquine is bad.
[2:11:17.180 --> 2:11:21.180]  Then you've heard forever for the last year and a half that ivermectin is not approved.
[2:11:21.180 --> 2:11:28.180]  Well on the NIH.gov's website, on this chart it actually shows that Remdesivir is the first drug listed
[2:11:28.180 --> 2:11:33.180]  under this characteristics of antiviral agents that are approved or under evaluation for the treatment of COVID-19.
[2:11:33.180 --> 2:11:36.180]  Remdesivir is first, go to the second page.
[2:11:36.180 --> 2:11:39.180]  I couldn't believe it, I just found this like three or four days ago.
[2:11:39.180 --> 2:11:42.180]  The second drug on the list is ivermectin.
[2:11:42.180 --> 2:11:50.180]  And it actually states the dose most commonly used in clinical trials is ivermectin 0.2 to 0.6 milligrams
[2:11:50.180 --> 2:11:55.180]  given as a single dose or as a once daily dose for up to five days.
[2:11:55.180 --> 2:12:03.180]  And this is the exact protocol that flccc.net has been proposing since December or January of last year
[2:12:03.180 --> 2:12:05.180]  that everybody wants to bash in the media.
[2:12:05.180 --> 2:12:07.180]  And it's on the NIH's website.
[2:12:07.180 --> 2:12:11.180]  Now what's interesting is, and I would love for anybody to say this about this chart,
[2:12:11.180 --> 2:12:17.180]  everyone who has a loved one in ICUs who has asked anybody, any doctor, administrator, nurse
[2:12:17.180 --> 2:12:22.180]  to please use ivermectin to treat their loved ones that are in ICUs and get them off of Remdesivir.
[2:12:22.180 --> 2:12:25.180]  And a doctor says it's not approved.
[2:12:25.180 --> 2:12:32.180]  Print this chart out and throw it in their face because it is on that NIH.gov's website right underneath Remdesivir
[2:12:32.180 --> 2:12:35.180]  is an option to treat COVID-19 and everyone needs to know it.
[2:12:35.180 --> 2:12:37.180]  This was buried on the site.
[2:12:37.180 --> 2:12:40.180]  If you actually go to Google duck.go, it doesn't matter.
[2:12:40.180 --> 2:12:43.180]  Type in NIH and the title we just showed you of the chart.
[2:12:43.180 --> 2:12:49.180]  Type that in and it will take you to the link. Scroll up on that page to a table and it says click here for the table.
[2:12:49.180 --> 2:12:50.180]  Click it, open it.
[2:12:50.180 --> 2:12:53.180]  This is what you get and go print it out and show it to the doctors in demand.
[2:12:53.180 --> 2:12:55.180]  They give that treatment protocol.
[2:12:55.180 --> 2:13:00.180]  It works. Ivermectin is proven safe and effective in over 60 studies around the world.
[2:13:00.180 --> 2:13:05.180]  In contrast, since May 1st, we've been told you can only use Remdesivir.
[2:13:05.180 --> 2:13:06.180]  I have four studies here.
[2:13:06.180 --> 2:13:10.180]  I wanted to look like you Owen, but you've got like a whole bunch more papers than me.
[2:13:10.180 --> 2:13:15.180]  I only set up a narrative over the last 16 months with Remdesivir in four trials.
[2:13:15.180 --> 2:13:17.180]  There's actually five, but I can just quote the fifth one.
[2:13:17.180 --> 2:13:20.180]  All right, so what do we know that they're doing in hospitals right now?
[2:13:20.180 --> 2:13:27.180]  I have been screaming since the middle of May 2020 that the mandated protocol by Anthony Fauci
[2:13:27.180 --> 2:13:32.180]  was going to be the reason all Americans who were treated for COVID-19 and died.
[2:13:32.180 --> 2:13:39.180]  The Remdesivir drug is why they were going to die and I could prove it and I could prove Anthony Fauci knew it beforehand.
[2:13:39.180 --> 2:13:47.180]  Anthony Fauci in May 2020 said that there was a study that was concluded on an experimental drug called Remdesivir on Ebola
[2:13:47.180 --> 2:13:52.180]  that went from November 2018 to December 2019.
[2:13:52.180 --> 2:13:57.180]  This is four and a half months before the mandate for COVID-19 came out to use Remdesivir.
[2:13:57.180 --> 2:13:59.180]  I'm holding the study right here.
[2:13:59.180 --> 2:14:04.180]  A randomized controlled trial of Ebola virus disease therapeutics, the New England Journal of Medicine.
[2:14:04.180 --> 2:14:11.180]  He stated that it was proven safe and effective Remdesivir that is safe and effective against the Ebola virus.
[2:14:11.180 --> 2:14:15.180]  So we're going to use it during this coronavirus, which are not the same viruses.
[2:14:15.180 --> 2:14:21.180]  But what I did was click the link that he was referencing on NIH.gov on this memo of mandated treatment for COVID-19.
[2:14:21.180 --> 2:14:23.180]  And what I found was I couldn't believe it.
[2:14:23.180 --> 2:14:32.180]  The actual study, the whole study was funded by NIAID, Anthony Fauci's Allergy and Infectious Disease of the National Institutes of Health.
[2:14:32.180 --> 2:14:34.180]  They actually funded the whole study.
[2:14:34.180 --> 2:14:36.180]  So Fauci basically paying himself.
[2:14:36.180 --> 2:14:42.180]  And then in the study they found that Remdesivir, the independent safety board for the study,
[2:14:42.180 --> 2:14:49.180]  found that Remdesivir caused a mortality rate of 54% of every African they gave the drug to.
[2:14:49.180 --> 2:14:53.180]  That was the highest death rate of all four experimental drugs in the trial.
[2:14:53.180 --> 2:14:57.180]  The safety board pulled Remdesivir from the trial and said it was too deadly.
[2:14:57.180 --> 2:15:00.180]  We can't give it to any more Africans with Ebola diagnosis.
[2:15:00.180 --> 2:15:06.180]  And I was going to say Ebola, which came out of Africa, so I guess they were trying to treat it at the source and it was just a complete disaster.
[2:15:06.180 --> 2:15:08.180]  Yes, so Remdesivir was pulled.
[2:15:08.180 --> 2:15:11.180]  A second drug was pulled because it had a 49% death rate.
[2:15:11.180 --> 2:15:14.180]  And then there was two other drugs that you're hearing about in the media right now.
[2:15:14.180 --> 2:15:22.180]  And the whole reason why you're hearing about them is because the NIH panel review for that study was nine or 10 individuals from the NIH itself,
[2:15:22.180 --> 2:15:24.180]  who also oversaw that study.
[2:15:24.180 --> 2:15:28.180]  Two other drugs that made it to the end of the trial were monoclonal antibodies.
[2:15:28.180 --> 2:15:32.180]  One was put in by DARPA called MAB114.
[2:15:32.180 --> 2:15:34.180]  The second drug was called Regeneron.
[2:15:34.180 --> 2:15:35.180]  Haven't you heard about that?
[2:15:35.180 --> 2:15:37.180]  Well, let's pause right there because we've got to go to a break.
[2:15:37.180 --> 2:15:39.180]  And so we'll come back with more of that.
[2:15:39.180 --> 2:15:50.180]  And, ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Artis has made a connection between Remdesivir and the ventilators that are killing people, too.
[2:15:50.180 --> 2:15:52.180]  This is all breaking right now.
[2:15:52.180 --> 2:15:53.180]  It's all in front of your face.
[2:15:53.180 --> 2:15:55.180]  It's all documented on the Internet.
[2:15:55.180 --> 2:15:58.180]  And thank God Dr. Artis is here sharing this information with us.

[2:17:55.180 --> 2:18:24.180]  That is from the transcript. Then he called up Pelosi, Schumer, and others to say I'm loyal to you.
[2:18:24.180 --> 2:18:32.180]  I'm going to protect Trump from using nuclear weapons when Trump was going for detente with China and North Korea at the time and Trump's responded saying it's a total lie.
[2:18:32.180 --> 2:18:34.180]  Pelosi's come out and admitted it happened.
[2:18:34.180 --> 2:18:41.180]  Hell, she bragged back on January 8th that it took place then and is saying that she honors Millie and that he's this courageous person.
[2:18:41.180 --> 2:18:43.180]  So are all these other Democrats.
[2:18:43.180 --> 2:18:49.180]  So this is the permanent deep state coup that's been in control for a long time now coming out of the shadows publicly.
[2:18:49.180 --> 2:18:55.180]  Remember these people literally hate you and your family now they're injecting you with poison soft kill injections.
[2:18:55.180 --> 2:19:20.180]  Wake up America or be destroyed.
[2:19:20.180 --> 2:19:28.180]  Well, that's that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise of covid vaccine passports.
[2:19:28.180 --> 2:19:29.180]  They even admit it.
[2:19:29.180 --> 2:19:32.180]  Now there's going to be a carbon tax attached to it.
[2:19:32.180 --> 2:19:36.180]  They're going to track where you go and what you do and decide where you can go and what you can do.
[2:19:36.180 --> 2:19:38.180]  That's what the lockdowns are about.
[2:19:38.180 --> 2:19:39.180]  You'll accept that.
[2:19:39.180 --> 2:19:40.180]  You'll accept anything.
[2:19:40.180 --> 2:19:47.180]  So again, the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending like they're part of the power structure.
[2:19:47.180 --> 2:19:50.180]  But they're all going to be targeted by this nightmare as well.
[2:19:50.180 --> 2:19:59.180]  We need to get back to basic human rights and promote them or all of us will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalist.
[2:19:59.180 --> 2:20:19.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:19.180 --> 2:20:25.180]  Just incredible information being discussed here with myself and Dr. Brian artist during the break.
[2:20:25.180 --> 2:20:30.180]  The doctor artist show dot com is where you can get more information.
[2:20:30.180 --> 2:20:36.180]  And so we just mean this is this is just groundbreaking game changing stuff that we just had in the last segment.
[2:20:36.180 --> 2:20:39.180]  How they say ivermectin is not approved use for covid.
[2:20:39.180 --> 2:20:42.180]  But then you go to the NIH website and I mean it's literally right there.
[2:20:42.180 --> 2:20:45.180]  He just printed out put it down on the desk gave me a copy.
[2:20:45.180 --> 2:20:47.180]  So they they act like this isn't out there.
[2:20:47.180 --> 2:20:48.180]  But you just simply go look and there it is.
[2:20:48.180 --> 2:20:54.180]  It's like saying the sun does not set in the west and then you go stand outside on a sunny day.
[2:20:54.180 --> 2:20:57.180]  And you watch the sun set in the west and like there it is the sun is setting in the west.
[2:20:57.180 --> 2:20:58.180]  Wow.
[2:20:58.180 --> 2:20:59.180]  No the sun does not set in the west.
[2:20:59.180 --> 2:21:01.180]  Anthony Fauci told me so.
[2:21:01.180 --> 2:21:02.180]  But it's actually worse than that.
[2:21:02.180 --> 2:21:10.180]  And I have been saying this just because I'm just getting people sharing me Intel and I'm just watching it happen.
[2:21:10.180 --> 2:21:11.180]  I hate to even admit that this is the case.
[2:21:11.180 --> 2:21:16.180]  But I've been telling people for months if you get covid the last place you want to go is a hospital.
[2:21:16.180 --> 2:21:18.180]  And I haven't exactly known all the ins and outs.
[2:21:18.180 --> 2:21:26.180]  I'm just watching people go into hospitals and die and go into hospitals and become prisoners where people who don't go into the hospital end up being just fine.
[2:21:26.180 --> 2:21:27.180]  Maybe it takes them a week to recover.
[2:21:27.180 --> 2:21:29.180]  Maybe it takes them a couple days.
[2:21:29.180 --> 2:21:30.180]  You get into the hospital.
[2:21:30.180 --> 2:21:33.180]  You're a prisoner and chances are you're going to die.
[2:21:33.180 --> 2:21:38.180]  And now Dr. Artis actually has the scientific reasons why that is happening.
[2:21:38.180 --> 2:21:41.180]  So this is even more bombshell exclusive stuff that we're getting right here.
[2:21:41.180 --> 2:21:43.180]  The whole world needs to know about this.
[2:21:43.180 --> 2:21:45.180]  We can literally save lives Dr. Artis.
[2:21:45.180 --> 2:21:50.180]  I have been trying since May 2020 to keep as many people as possible out of ICU's in America.
[2:21:50.180 --> 2:21:55.180]  Your likelihood of surviving goes up if you stay away from the hospitals.
[2:21:55.180 --> 2:21:56.180]  Sad but true.
[2:21:56.180 --> 2:21:57.180]  Explain why.
[2:21:57.180 --> 2:21:58.180]  Okay.
[2:21:58.180 --> 2:22:03.180]  So Anthony Fauci knew in May 2020 that there was an Ebola study that he was quoting proved room-desivir to be safe and effective.
[2:22:03.180 --> 2:22:14.180]  And that's why we're going to use it now during this pandemic of a coronavirus only to find out if you look at the study on Ebola from 2018 to 2019 published in December.
[2:22:14.180 --> 2:22:20.180]  It actually showed that room-desivir killed 54% of all people you gave it to in the trial.
[2:22:20.180 --> 2:22:26.180]  It was the most deadly drug in that trial and there was three other drugs that actually were proven to be less deadly.
[2:22:26.180 --> 2:22:28.180]  But these four drugs did not have a control group.
[2:22:28.180 --> 2:22:33.180]  It was just we're giving all you guys these four drugs in four regions of Africa and let's see what happens.
[2:22:33.180 --> 2:22:36.180]  The Regeneron monoclonal antibody was also in that study.
[2:22:36.180 --> 2:22:40.180]  I need to throw these numbers out to you because everybody asked what about these monoclonal antibodies?
[2:22:40.180 --> 2:22:47.180]  Monoclonal antibodies Regeneron actually had a mortality rate in the Ebola trial of 33% of all people they gave it to still died.
[2:22:47.180 --> 2:22:50.180]  MAB114 was put in by DARPA.
[2:22:50.180 --> 2:22:51.180]  It's a monoclonal antibody.
[2:22:51.180 --> 2:22:54.180]  It had a death rate of 35%.
[2:22:54.180 --> 2:23:00.180]  And then ZMAP, which was put in by our United States Health Department, actually put that in there.
[2:23:00.180 --> 2:23:01.180]  It's a monoclonal antibody.
[2:23:01.180 --> 2:23:03.180]  It had a death rate of 49%.
[2:23:03.180 --> 2:23:10.180]  So all these drugs had a very high percentage of death rate higher than the less than 1% of all COVID infected people on the planet.
[2:23:10.180 --> 2:23:14.180]  I was going to say even Ebola I think was like a 25% death rate.
[2:23:14.180 --> 2:23:17.180]  So the drugs are more deadly than the viruses they're fighting.
[2:23:17.180 --> 2:23:25.180]  So they selected a drug from a study Anthony Fauci was overseeing and actually picked the one that killed the most people to make it the mandated drug of choice for Americans.
[2:23:25.180 --> 2:23:32.180]  In the same May memo, he asked the federal government to buy up all the stocks of Remdesivir and not share it with another country until the end of 2020.
[2:23:32.180 --> 2:23:39.180]  If you want to know why America had the most deaths supposedly from COVID-19, it was not from COVID-19 infections.
[2:23:39.180 --> 2:23:41.180]  They all died in ICUs in America.
[2:23:41.180 --> 2:23:48.180]  550,000 of you, more than any other country in the world, and they were all being treated with the same deadly drug called Remdesivir.
[2:23:48.180 --> 2:23:57.180]  So Anthony Fauci on that May memo also quoted a second study that supports his decision to use Remdesivir, this proven deadly drug from the Ebola trial.
[2:23:57.180 --> 2:24:02.180]  And the actual owner of Remdesivir and the patent owner is a company called Gilead Sciences.
[2:24:02.180 --> 2:24:11.180]  They did a 53 COVID-19 infected little personal study called a cohort study from 53 patients from Japan, America and Canada.
[2:24:11.180 --> 2:24:14.180]  And they gave these COVID-19 sick people Remdesivir for 10 days.
[2:24:14.180 --> 2:24:17.180]  Do you know what the results was in 10 days?
[2:24:17.180 --> 2:24:23.180]  23% of all of them experienced multiple organ failure, acute kidney failure, hypotension, and septic shock.
[2:24:23.180 --> 2:24:32.180]  Another 8% had to be taken off the drug before day 10 because they experienced such severe acute kidney failure and liver failure, they were going to die.
[2:24:32.180 --> 2:24:36.180]  That's 31% of everyone they gave that drug to for COVID-19 infected people.
[2:24:36.180 --> 2:24:39.180]  This was the drug Anthony Fauci chose.
[2:24:39.180 --> 2:24:41.180]  This is why so many people are dying in ICUs.
[2:24:41.180 --> 2:24:48.180]  Now fast forward five months later, after May, France decides to do their own study because they're not using Remdesivir.
[2:24:48.180 --> 2:24:56.180]  Remember, Anthony Fauci told our government to only buy up all the reserves of this experimental drug that by with the way before the pandemic,
[2:24:56.180 --> 2:24:59.180]  Remdesivir had failed in four human trials to be safe or effective.
[2:24:59.180 --> 2:25:02.180]  It was proven to be deadly even before the Ebola trial.
[2:25:02.180 --> 2:25:05.180]  It was never FDA approved before the pandemic.
[2:25:05.180 --> 2:25:10.180]  Anthony Fauci chose a non FDA approved safe and efficacious viral drug for this pandemic.
[2:25:10.180 --> 2:25:12.180]  So, you know, that's just another element of this.
[2:25:12.180 --> 2:25:22.180]  Ivermectin Nobel Prize winning approved for all these different uses and Fauci goes with the ones the vaccines and Remdesivir that aren't approved.
[2:25:22.180 --> 2:25:27.180]  He literally chose the non approved drugs and then we're told by our leadership, we'll do anything to stop the spread.
[2:25:27.180 --> 2:25:28.180]  Well, how about Ivermectin?
[2:25:28.180 --> 2:25:30.180]  No, not that even worse.
[2:25:30.180 --> 2:25:41.180]  He picked the one drug that killed more people than anybody else in a trial and it was extracted from the trial and then quoted to the American public and all doctors and hospitals to use this one drug and know where the drug was proven to be safe and effective against Ebola.
[2:25:41.180 --> 2:25:42.180]  No, it wasn't.
[2:25:42.180 --> 2:25:44.180]  It was proven to be the most dangerous.
[2:25:44.180 --> 2:25:47.180]  So the safety board pulled it halfway through the study.
[2:25:47.180 --> 2:25:54.180]  So France five months later after America's killed 400,000 people or Anthony Fauci's killed 400,000 people in America with Remdesivir.
[2:25:54.180 --> 2:25:56.180]  France decides to do their own study.
[2:25:56.180 --> 2:26:01.180]  They take five COVID-19 patients and give them this experimental drug called Remdesivir.
[2:26:01.180 --> 2:26:03.180]  This is what they found five.
[2:26:03.180 --> 2:26:12.180]  Two of them had to come off the drug because their liver enzyme activity went up three to five times normal within the 14 window of time.
[2:26:12.180 --> 2:26:16.180]  Four out of the five couldn't even do the full 14 days because their organs started failing.
[2:26:16.180 --> 2:26:22.180]  Two of the five has such a cute kidney failure, they had to have renal transplants.
[2:26:22.180 --> 2:26:25.180]  Their kidneys had to be taken out and put someone else's in.
[2:26:25.180 --> 2:26:27.180]  That's how dangerous Remdesivir was.
[2:26:27.180 --> 2:26:29.180]  And not even two weeks of studies.
[2:26:29.180 --> 2:26:30.180]  And in less than two weeks.
[2:26:30.180 --> 2:26:36.180]  So four of the five had to come off the drug because of liver damage and disease and acute kidney failure for transplants.
[2:26:36.180 --> 2:26:37.180]  Two of the five died.
[2:26:37.180 --> 2:26:39.180]  Did France choose Remdesivir?
[2:26:39.180 --> 2:26:40.180]  No.
[2:26:40.180 --> 2:26:42.180]  That was in September five months after the May mandate.
[2:26:42.180 --> 2:26:44.180]  But America kept chugging along.
[2:26:44.180 --> 2:26:50.180]  We're still right now making that the only drug doctors are being told in hospitals to inject inside of our loved ones.
[2:26:50.180 --> 2:26:51.180]  All right.
[2:26:51.180 --> 2:26:54.180]  So the World Health Organization does a review five months ago.
[2:26:54.180 --> 2:27:01.180]  Someone looks at the database for the World Health Organization and they want to do a, it's called a reporting odds ratio.
[2:27:01.180 --> 2:27:08.180]  They want to see how many times does acute renal failure come up when Remdesivir is used to treat COVID-19.
[2:27:08.180 --> 2:27:10.180]  And then they compare it to three other drugs.
[2:27:10.180 --> 2:27:13.180]  One is hydroxychloroquine that other countries are using.
[2:27:13.180 --> 2:27:15.180]  And this is what they found.
[2:27:15.180 --> 2:27:27.180]  They found that the reporting odds ratio of acute renal failure with Remdesivir was 20-fold that of all comparative drugs, including hydroxychloroquine.
[2:27:27.180 --> 2:27:29.180]  Now I need to explain to you, this is what's happening.
[2:27:29.180 --> 2:27:31.180]  And Anthony Fauci knew it beforehand.
[2:27:31.180 --> 2:27:41.180]  In the March 2020 study done by Gilead Sciences, they found 31% of all people they gave the drug to in less than 10 days experienced acute kidney failure and multiple organ failure.
[2:27:41.180 --> 2:27:47.180]  When you shut down the kidneys in somebody and poison their kidneys to death, the body retains water.
[2:27:47.180 --> 2:27:51.180]  Your kidney excretes water by processing it in the form of urine.
[2:27:51.180 --> 2:27:59.180]  You shut down the kidneys, you make the body retain water, it fills up your abdomen, then it goes around your heart inside what's called the pericardium.
[2:27:59.180 --> 2:28:01.180]  And then it floods into your lungs.
[2:28:01.180 --> 2:28:05.180]  And you are drowning these Americans and people around the world using Remdesivir.
[2:28:05.180 --> 2:28:10.180]  You're drowning them to death with a side effect called pulmonary edema.
[2:28:10.180 --> 2:28:19.180]  And no hospital in America is doing a sputum test to actually determine is it actually viral or bacterial or God forbid what they're calling COVID pneumonia.
[2:28:19.180 --> 2:28:21.180]  No, that's not hospital protocol.
[2:28:21.180 --> 2:28:23.180]  They won't even do it if you ask them to.
[2:28:23.180 --> 2:28:25.180]  They just take a chest x-ray and say that's pneumonia.
[2:28:25.180 --> 2:28:26.180]  No, it isn't.
[2:28:26.180 --> 2:28:27.180]  It's pulmonary edema.
[2:28:27.180 --> 2:28:34.180]  You caused acute kidney failure and everyone who has a loved one who has died, NICUs, being treated with Remdesivir.
[2:28:34.180 --> 2:28:36.180]  Look at your actual death certificate.
[2:28:36.180 --> 2:28:39.180]  It's going to say this, complications of COVID, acute renal failure.
[2:28:39.180 --> 2:28:41.180]  Secondary COVID pneumonia.
[2:28:41.180 --> 2:28:53.180]  In the order we knew the drug was going to shut down your body and cause acute kidney failure, resulting in water in your lungs mixed with the pneumonia like mucus, then they of course have to vent you.
[2:28:53.180 --> 2:28:54.180]  Let's expand on that.
[2:28:54.180 --> 2:28:58.180]  We got to go to break because this is so key and this is why the hospital is such a dangerous place right now.
[2:28:58.180 --> 2:29:06.180]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[2:29:06.180 --> 2:29:07.180]  Here's why.
[2:29:07.180 --> 2:29:11.180]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[2:29:11.180 --> 2:29:16.180]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[2:29:16.180 --> 2:29:25.180]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[2:29:25.180 --> 2:29:34.180]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:29:34.180 --> 2:29:40.180]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too.
[2:29:40.180 --> 2:29:44.180]  Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[2:29:44.180 --> 2:29:46.180]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:29:46.180 --> 2:29:54.180]  Look for the free report, crisis cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[2:29:54.180 --> 2:30:05.180]  Yours free at mysolarbackup.com.
[2:30:24.180 --> 2:30:29.180]  I'm told to know that he was proud of what he was doing because he was backed by the Deep State.
[2:30:29.180 --> 2:30:32.180]  This permanent bureaucracy sees America as its enemy.
[2:30:32.180 --> 2:30:34.180]  It sees the American people as its enemy.
[2:30:34.180 --> 2:30:36.180]  It sees prosperity as its enemy.
[2:30:36.180 --> 2:30:40.180]  And it conspired with the Communist Chinese to threaten them basically and say,
[2:30:40.180 --> 2:30:46.180]  Trump may nuke you, but if he tries, we'll call and say we're attacking you so you can respond first.
[2:30:46.180 --> 2:30:48.180]  That's beyond reason.
[2:30:48.180 --> 2:30:53.180]  But it shows the type of anti-American sycophants living in their own vetted bubble that try to get away with this.
[2:30:53.180 --> 2:30:59.180]  Millie and all of his accomplices need to go to prison now for life.
[2:30:59.180 --> 2:31:04.180]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[2:31:04.180 --> 2:31:06.180]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[2:31:06.180 --> 2:31:11.180]  I was barely holding onto a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[2:31:11.180 --> 2:31:14.180]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1.
[2:31:14.180 --> 2:31:15.180]  And it worked pretty good.
[2:31:15.180 --> 2:31:18.180]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with that too.
[2:31:18.180 --> 2:31:21.180]  You had, you know, with the Deep Bird and the Forest, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[2:31:21.180 --> 2:31:28.180]  So I took it and then in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[2:31:28.180 --> 2:31:31.180]  You know, I could think again. I could connect with people again.
[2:31:31.180 --> 2:31:38.180]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[2:31:38.180 --> 2:31:40.180]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[2:31:40.180 --> 2:31:42.180]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[2:31:42.180 --> 2:31:44.180]  It literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[2:31:44.180 --> 2:31:45.180]  It's amazing. It works.
[2:31:45.180 --> 2:31:51.180]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free of the globalist system.
[2:31:51.180 --> 2:31:54.180]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[2:31:54.180 --> 2:32:16.180]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[2:32:25.180 --> 2:32:27.180]  And overall, a stronger immune system.

[2:33:23.180 --> 2:33:28.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:28.180 --> 2:33:34.180]  It's really crazy, ladies and gentlemen. Again, Dr. Brian Artisan Studio.
[2:33:34.180 --> 2:33:40.180]  And he can break this down obviously with his medical background and then all the research that he's done.
[2:33:40.180 --> 2:33:42.180]  But we've witnessed it in real time.
[2:33:42.180 --> 2:33:44.180]  That's why we've been discouraging people to go to the hospitals.
[2:33:44.180 --> 2:33:48.180]  I wish that wasn't the case. I wish that the hospital was the most trusted place you could go.
[2:33:48.180 --> 2:33:52.180]  You know you were going to get the best treatment. Now it seems it's run by greed.
[2:33:52.180 --> 2:33:57.180]  But explain the connection now, Dr. Artisan, because this is so key for people to understand.
[2:33:57.180 --> 2:34:02.180]  They're lying about how people are dying. Just like they lied about it last year. They're lying about it this year.
[2:34:02.180 --> 2:34:11.180]  But now they're being killed by either medical malpractice or this is just some sort of eugenics program that they're running and they don't want to tell us about it.
[2:34:11.180 --> 2:34:19.180]  So explain what happens when people are sick with COVID and they go into the hospital and they get told to take remdesivir.
[2:34:19.180 --> 2:34:22.180]  So explain, get into how that's what they're told to take.
[2:34:22.180 --> 2:34:27.180]  And then the side effects from that puts them on the vent which then ends up killing them. Break that down.
[2:34:27.180 --> 2:34:36.180]  So here we go. So from the actual March 2020 study where Gilead actually gave the drug remdesivir to 53 patients for a 10 day period.
[2:34:36.180 --> 2:34:45.180]  What they found was 10% of all people they gave it to within five days had such acute kidney failure and liver failure they had to come off the drug they were dying.
[2:34:45.180 --> 2:34:52.180]  Five days. You want to know where Anthony Fauci got the five day treatment window for remdesivir in hospitals?
[2:34:52.180 --> 2:34:56.180]  It's what the protocol is right now. Five days of remdesivir.
[2:34:56.180 --> 2:35:00.180]  Six days you're dead. Six days to ten days you're going to be dead.
[2:35:00.180 --> 2:35:05.180]  So they are driving a narrative to kill as many Americans as possible and I have to just point this out.
[2:35:05.180 --> 2:35:12.180]  Still to this day we're up to 690,000 people in America have died as a result of COVID-19 supposedly.
[2:35:12.180 --> 2:35:19.180]  95 to 99% of all of them died in ICUs. What were they all treated with? A deadly drug called remdesivir.
[2:35:19.180 --> 2:35:22.180]  Since April of this year they have been doing something else.
[2:35:22.180 --> 2:35:31.180]  They not only had remdesivir that caused acute kidney failure and multiple organ failure in 31% of all people they gave it to between days five and ten.
[2:35:31.180 --> 2:35:37.180]  They added dexamethasone which is actually shown to cause 4% more acute kidney failure. It's a steroid.
[2:35:37.180 --> 2:35:43.180]  And then they added a antibiotic called vancomycin. And I told the world be ready.
[2:35:43.180 --> 2:35:53.180]  They figured out if they add vancomycin it will cause an additional percentage of acute kidney failure and they can make the delta variant look even more dangerous for the young and the healthy.
[2:35:53.180 --> 2:36:04.180]  And sure enough as you see the death rates or any deaths at all in ICUs you can correlate them back to acute kidney failure caused by a combination of any of these drugs but remdesivir is number one.
[2:36:04.180 --> 2:36:13.180]  We just showed you that the NIH has it on their website that actually ivermectin is approved and under evaluation drug to treat COVID-19 in America.
[2:36:13.180 --> 2:36:25.180]  So demand ivermectin and show to the doctors that this is what you want or else your loved ones are going to be intubated because you're shutting down their kidneys, flooding their body with water, their lungs with water while they're being left on a saline bag.
[2:36:25.180 --> 2:36:28.180]  You're pumping water in shutting down kidneys that excrete it.
[2:36:28.180 --> 2:36:33.180]  So you're literally pumping liquid death into their lungs.
[2:36:33.180 --> 2:36:38.180]  Yes. I've actually called this since May 2020, Anthony's genocide. This is before we all started seeing the deaths come out.
[2:36:38.180 --> 2:36:46.180]  I said you're going to see this. You're going to see acute kidney failure leading to pulmonary edema that they're going to diagnose as secondary pneumonia to COVID and it isn't.
[2:36:46.180 --> 2:36:56.180]  Well see I just knew because I don't have a medical background. I just knew that ventilator is like one of the last efforts you ever want to take because your lungs are never going to function normal again.
[2:36:56.180 --> 2:37:04.180]  Your automatic breathing reaction is never going to be the same again. And so it's a risky thing to put someone on ventilator, but sometimes it's the last option to keep somebody alive.
[2:37:04.180 --> 2:37:16.180]  This was like, this is what they wanted. They wanted to put you on a ventilator as like a first option, but now that you've connected the dots, that it's the side effect from this drug shuts down the kidneys, fills the lungs with water.
[2:37:16.180 --> 2:37:25.180]  As they're pumping water into you, it just goes right into the lungs, then they blow your lungs out and they kill you. It's all part of a process and they won't even give you ivermectin.
[2:37:25.180 --> 2:37:35.180]  You also wonder, people ask me all the time, are the doctors complicit in ICUs? This is what I say. They are now. It's been a year and a half. You've done the same protocol every time.
[2:37:35.180 --> 2:37:45.180]  Your hospital administrators are telling you what to do. You have to have figured out by now that remdesivir, the cocktail treatment in ICUs is the number one killer of these COVID-19 patients.
[2:37:45.180 --> 2:38:02.180]  So the question becomes, if the NIH is telling us and publishing on their website that ivermectin is an approved drug and it actually causes zero renal failure in anybody ever in 40 years, ever 4.4 billion doses around the world, no one has ever gotten acute kidney failure from it.
[2:38:02.180 --> 2:38:06.180]  But remdesivir is proving to do it in 31% of everybody you give it to.
[2:38:06.180 --> 2:38:10.180]  And now we just know that tenfold because of all the people taking it and dying.
[2:38:10.180 --> 2:38:18.180]  And the question is, is why would they continue to do it? Well, if you go on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services dot gov, CMS dot gov.
[2:38:18.180 --> 2:38:33.180]  There is a bonus payout that the actual CMS is giving to all hospitals and doctors around the country that if they will treat individuals with COVID-19 with remdesivir, which is like 3,600 bucks of treatment compared to ivermectin, which is like 7 bucks.
[2:38:33.180 --> 2:38:48.180]  If they will choose remdesivir as the treatment for all COVID-19 patients, there are codes the CMS gives the hospital that if you will code it for remdesivir and treat them with it, we will give you a 20% bonus on top of the charge for the remdesivir treatment.
[2:38:48.180 --> 2:38:54.180]  So this incentivizes hospitals to tell doctors, you're going to use remdesivir, we need more money.
[2:38:54.180 --> 2:39:05.180]  The government is actually paying hospitals 20% more for a remdesivir treatment and they're giving them the treatment codes to use to put on their charts.
[2:39:05.180 --> 2:39:08.180]  This is why they don't want to stop.
[2:39:08.180 --> 2:39:19.180]  The government, your government is incentivizing hospitals to drown your loved ones to death with pulmonary edema mixed with some cytokine storm from the SARS-CoV-2 virus that might be in your lungs.
[2:39:19.180 --> 2:39:24.180]  But for sure, all of you who have loved ones who have died, look at your death certificate.
[2:39:24.180 --> 2:39:27.180]  Acute renal failures on there, renal means kidneys.
[2:39:27.180 --> 2:39:36.180]  The drug that they used shut down your loved ones kidneys, created pulmonary edema and drowned your loved one to death and then vented him to the end of his days.
[2:39:36.180 --> 2:39:39.180]  And they're using in a lot of hospitals a drug used to euthanize people.
[2:39:39.180 --> 2:39:43.180]  It's called medazolam to actually put them in a comatose state.
[2:39:43.180 --> 2:39:51.180]  That was used for lethal injections for years in the UK as being used to kill people in elderly care centers for the last year and a half.
[2:39:51.180 --> 2:39:54.180]  And then code them as COVID-19 when we know that drug kills you.
[2:39:54.180 --> 2:39:56.180]  But this is what they're using.
[2:39:56.180 --> 2:39:58.180]  We've seen this on medical reports, by the way.
[2:39:58.180 --> 2:40:01.180]  And by the way, follow the money is something most people can wrap their head around.
[2:40:01.180 --> 2:40:03.180]  It's a pretty easy concept, follow the money.
[2:40:03.180 --> 2:40:13.180]  And I remember when over a year and a half ago, when the COVID outbreak panics first started happening, we had whistleblowers coming on saying, look, here's what they're doing.
[2:40:13.180 --> 2:40:17.180]  And this is how they, this is how they helped escalate the numbers.
[2:40:17.180 --> 2:40:21.180]  They said, if you have a COVID-19 patient, it was like boom, $10,000, just boom, 10,000 bucks.
[2:40:21.180 --> 2:40:23.180]  So they wanted to diagnose everybody with COVID.
[2:40:23.180 --> 2:40:25.180]  Oh, you've got COVID runny nose.
[2:40:25.180 --> 2:40:26.180]  You've got COVID headache.
[2:40:26.180 --> 2:40:27.180]  You've got COVID.
[2:40:27.180 --> 2:40:28.180]  Oh, you coughed.
[2:40:28.180 --> 2:40:31.180]  You've got COVID 10,000, 10,000, 10,000, 10,000.
[2:40:31.180 --> 2:40:36.180]  Then we found out if they would put them on a ventilator, they were getting bonuses up to $50,000.
[2:40:36.180 --> 2:40:39.180]  So it was, oh, let's put you on a ventilator, 50,000.
[2:40:39.180 --> 2:40:40.180]  Let's put you on a ventilator, 50,000.
[2:40:40.180 --> 2:40:42.180]  So just lining their pockets.
[2:40:42.180 --> 2:40:43.180]  The nurses didn't mind.
[2:40:43.180 --> 2:40:46.180]  They were getting bonuses to do dance videos on TikTok.
[2:40:46.180 --> 2:40:49.180]  So they didn't mind the whole, the fear and the panic and putting the people on vents.
[2:40:49.180 --> 2:40:51.180]  But now this is a new level.
[2:40:51.180 --> 2:40:59.180]  I'm pretty sure in India, it's seven US dollars for what they call a blister pack of ivermectin, seven US dollars.
[2:40:59.180 --> 2:41:01.180]  Blister pack treats it for a week.
[2:41:01.180 --> 2:41:06.180]  You don't have COVID versus like you were saying, 3,600 for remdesivir.
[2:41:06.180 --> 2:41:08.180]  So this is an easy follow the money aspect.
[2:41:08.180 --> 2:41:10.180]  But let me just ask you this angle.
[2:41:10.180 --> 2:41:15.180]  So we know that Fauci helped get this remdesivir on the market.
[2:41:15.180 --> 2:41:17.180]  It failed in the trials in Africa.
[2:41:17.180 --> 2:41:18.180]  Funny how they always want to test in Africa.
[2:41:18.180 --> 2:41:20.180]  That's the whole another story.
[2:41:20.180 --> 2:41:26.180]  But so is it a situation where they had all of this drug, all of this remdesivir basically sitting out there with no use.
[2:41:26.180 --> 2:41:27.180]  It was failed.
[2:41:27.180 --> 2:41:30.180]  So they, so they said, look, we got to do something with this access drug.
[2:41:30.180 --> 2:41:32.180]  We can't just take this hit.
[2:41:32.180 --> 2:41:34.180]  So they said, well, let's just give it to Americans.
[2:41:34.180 --> 2:41:38.180]  No, it couldn't have been that because in the Ebola trial, there was two drugs put in by our federal government.
[2:41:38.180 --> 2:41:40.180]  ZMAP was by the United States Department of Health.
[2:41:40.180 --> 2:41:42.180]  So it wasn't even an excess thing.
[2:41:42.180 --> 2:41:44.180]  No, this was not excess.
[2:41:44.180 --> 2:41:45.180]  No, this was a that drug.
[2:41:45.180 --> 2:41:46.180]  That's even worse.
[2:41:46.180 --> 2:41:49.180]  The narrative had to be set for America.
[2:41:49.180 --> 2:41:50.180]  Look at it.
[2:41:50.180 --> 2:41:55.180]  We are 4.7% of the entire world's population in the United States of America.
[2:41:55.180 --> 2:41:58.180]  4.5% of the entire world's population.
[2:41:58.180 --> 2:42:04.180]  By the end of 2020, we had a quarter of the entire world's deaths of COVID-19.
[2:42:04.180 --> 2:42:09.180]  We represent 4.7% or so of the entire world's population.
[2:42:09.180 --> 2:42:13.180]  Why did we have a quarter of all the deaths in the world?
[2:42:13.180 --> 2:42:16.180]  We were the only country treating people with remdesivir.
[2:42:16.180 --> 2:42:24.180]  And we had to get our federal agencies convinced and our American society convinced that COVID-19 was deadly and it wasn't.
[2:42:24.180 --> 2:42:26.180]  The drug treatment was deadly.
[2:42:26.180 --> 2:42:31.180]  But then in the media, they could tell you all these people were dying of COVID-19, 550,000 people.
[2:42:31.180 --> 2:42:36.180]  So they could sell you on an idea that a vaccine was coming to save all of you.
[2:42:36.180 --> 2:42:38.180]  And that is never true.
[2:42:38.180 --> 2:42:39.180]  You never needed it.
[2:42:39.180 --> 2:42:44.180]  What's interesting is, is we know less than 1% of the entire world died who were infected with COVID-19.
[2:42:44.180 --> 2:42:45.180]  Less than 1%.
[2:42:45.180 --> 2:42:48.180]  But it's an even higher percentage if you went to the hospital.
[2:42:48.180 --> 2:42:51.180]  All right, we got another segment with Dr. Artis coming up.
[2:42:51.180 --> 2:42:53.180]  Don't go anywhere, folks.
[2:42:53.180 --> 2:42:55.180]  Share this with your friends and family.
[2:42:55.180 --> 2:42:58.180]  This is such key information.
[2:42:58.180 --> 2:43:06.180]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere.
[2:43:06.180 --> 2:43:11.180]  But if you look at all the different studies and reports about NASA and other governments and other agencies,
[2:43:11.180 --> 2:43:14.180]  they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate.
[2:43:14.180 --> 2:43:19.180]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[2:43:19.180 --> 2:43:22.180]  So yes, climate change is totally real.
[2:43:22.180 --> 2:43:26.180]  But notice, first they called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s,
[2:43:26.180 --> 2:43:29.180]  and then it's going to be global warming, and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted to.
[2:43:29.180 --> 2:43:31.180]  Okay, now it's just climate change.
[2:43:31.180 --> 2:43:41.180]  But did you know that man-made climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN?
[2:43:41.180 --> 2:43:44.180]  They have weather control treaties from 1979.
[2:43:44.180 --> 2:43:47.180]  Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time.
[2:43:47.180 --> 2:43:54.180]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[2:43:54.180 --> 2:43:57.180]  So yes, man-made climate change is real.
[2:43:57.180 --> 2:44:04.180]  When Bob Woodward's new book came out, alleging that General Milley had called the head of the Chinese military and said,
[2:44:04.180 --> 2:44:08.180]  Trump might nuke you, he tried to overthrow the U.S. government.
[2:44:08.180 --> 2:44:11.180]  But basically, I'm protecting you and I'll warn you if we launch an attack,
[2:44:11.180 --> 2:44:15.180]  which was the greatest reason in U.S. history that has ever been committed.
[2:44:15.180 --> 2:44:17.180]  People said, oh, Alex, it must not be true.
[2:44:17.180 --> 2:44:18.180]  And I might wait.
[2:44:18.180 --> 2:44:21.180]  Bob Woodward's former naval intelligence, he's a big insider globalist.
[2:44:21.180 --> 2:44:24.180]  He wouldn't have put this out unless they wanted to put it out,
[2:44:24.180 --> 2:44:30.180]  say that Milley was a hero to set the precedent that you can have a permanent bureaucracy stay behind network deep state,
[2:44:30.180 --> 2:44:33.180]  basically that has its own bureaucratic coup over America.
[2:44:33.180 --> 2:44:34.180]  That's why he put bite in.
[2:44:34.180 --> 2:44:37.180]  He's so incredibly weak to undermine the idea of the presidency.
[2:44:37.180 --> 2:44:40.180]  Well, people said I was making it up with Bob Woodward's line.
[2:44:40.180 --> 2:44:42.180]  Well, now Milley admits he did it.
[2:44:42.180 --> 2:44:44.180]  You see, I didn't need to trust Bob Woodward.
[2:44:44.180 --> 2:44:50.180]  I remember Pelosi on January 8th ragging that she got the call for Milley that he take control of the nukes.
[2:44:50.180 --> 2:44:53.180]  So this treason was hiding in plain view back then and we covered it.
[2:44:53.180 --> 2:44:54.180]  See, I have a memory folks.
[2:44:54.180 --> 2:44:55.180]  I remember all this stuff.
[2:44:55.180 --> 2:45:24.180]  That's why I know it's true and what's false.
[2:45:25.180 --> 2:45:44.180]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart and support us.
[2:45:44.180 --> 2:45:46.180]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[2:45:46.180 --> 2:45:54.180]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done and just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[2:45:54.180 --> 2:45:58.180]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support InfoWars.
[2:45:58.180 --> 2:46:27.180]  God bless.
[2:46:28.180 --> 2:46:32.180]  For a limited time, only until the end of the month of September.
[2:46:32.180 --> 2:46:36.180]  That's only about 12, 13 days as of the time we're taping this.
[2:46:36.180 --> 2:46:38.180]  And that means all these amazing products.
[2:46:38.180 --> 2:46:41.180]  We have Ultra 12, highest quality B12 taken out of the tongue.
[2:46:41.180 --> 2:46:45.180]  We have Winter Sun, highest quality organic vitamin D3 taken out of the tongue.
[2:46:45.180 --> 2:46:46.180]  Amazing.
[2:46:46.180 --> 2:46:47.180]  We've got Knockout the Sleep Bay.
[2:46:47.180 --> 2:46:51.180]  We've got Heron Beard formula that's got all the vitamins and minerals as well, not just for your Heron Beard.
[2:46:51.180 --> 2:46:57.180]  And we've got our great liquid turmeric formula all 50% off at InfoWars.com and it keeps us on the air.
[2:46:57.180 --> 2:47:02.180]  Take action and I thank you.
[2:47:02.180 --> 2:47:17.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:47:17.180 --> 2:47:25.180]  Key information, ladies and gentlemen, this interview needs to get 100 million views, a billion views.
[2:47:25.180 --> 2:47:27.180]  But of course, with the censorship, it probably won't.
[2:47:27.180 --> 2:47:29.180]  But you are the modern day Paul Revere.
[2:47:29.180 --> 2:47:32.180]  You are the messengers that can get this information out.
[2:47:32.180 --> 2:47:39.180]  And by the way, we're going to take little snippets of this so you can share 90-second videos, two-minute videos, or you can share the whole interview.
[2:47:39.180 --> 2:47:41.180]  It's going to be maybe an hour long, maybe more.
[2:47:41.180 --> 2:47:43.180]  We may have to go into the fourth hour here with Dr. Artis.
[2:47:43.180 --> 2:47:47.180]  But let's now get into the vaccine angle of all of this.
[2:47:47.180 --> 2:47:53.180]  So as you were explaining to me in the break, August 1st was such a big day because that's when Israel did their vaccine rollout.
[2:47:53.180 --> 2:47:56.180]  And then since then, Israel has had the most COVID.
[2:47:56.180 --> 2:48:00.180]  And so here's what the media does and we're going to get Dr. Artis' take.
[2:48:00.180 --> 2:48:01.180]  Let's clarify.
[2:48:01.180 --> 2:48:07.180]  August 1st of this year is when Israel started giving the third vaccines called booster shots.
[2:48:07.180 --> 2:48:08.180]  Oh, the boosters.
[2:48:08.180 --> 2:48:14.180]  This is when they rolled out in Israel when 98% of all the country was already vaccinated with the first and second shots.
[2:48:14.180 --> 2:48:17.180]  They gave August 1st the booster shots.
[2:48:17.180 --> 2:48:20.180]  So here's how the media covers up what's really going on.
[2:48:20.180 --> 2:48:23.180]  This is the Washington Post, August 31st.
[2:48:23.180 --> 2:48:25.180]  Coronavirus vaccines work.
[2:48:25.180 --> 2:48:28.180]  If they really have to convince you of it, they probably don't.
[2:48:28.180 --> 2:48:31.180]  But this statistical illusion makes people think they don't.
[2:48:31.180 --> 2:48:37.180]  And it's all about what we're going to get into here, that as soon as they rolled out the vaccines in Israel and then the boosters and you have the dates,
[2:48:37.180 --> 2:48:42.180]  that's when Israel had the biggest spike in COVID really probably on planet Earth.
[2:48:42.180 --> 2:48:44.180]  I mean, just boom, straight up.
[2:48:44.180 --> 2:48:45.180]  That's because they vaccinated everybody.
[2:48:45.180 --> 2:48:47.180]  They literally gave them COVID.
[2:48:47.180 --> 2:48:53.180]  So then they say, oh, see, just because everybody that got vaccinated got COVID doesn't mean the vaccines don't work.
[2:48:53.180 --> 2:48:55.180]  It's just an illusion.
[2:48:55.180 --> 2:48:56.180]  Oh, it's just an illusion.
[2:48:56.180 --> 2:48:57.180]  Like Ivermectin works.
[2:48:57.180 --> 2:48:59.180]  Oh, that's just an illusion too.
[2:48:59.180 --> 2:49:04.180]  Oh, so explain the real story about what's going on in Israel with these vaccines.
[2:49:04.180 --> 2:49:08.180]  So the third shots for all of Israel, everybody's already fully vaccinated.
[2:49:08.180 --> 2:49:10.180]  The majority of everybody, they give them these booster shots.
[2:49:10.180 --> 2:49:17.180]  And then like you mentioned, it's skyrockets, not in COVID, just cases, hospitalized cases for COVID-19.
[2:49:17.180 --> 2:49:24.180]  It's higher the spikes than the highest spikes in Israel during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 right now.
[2:49:24.180 --> 2:49:25.180]  The vaccine variant.
[2:49:25.180 --> 2:49:26.180]  Yes.
[2:49:26.180 --> 2:49:28.180]  So the vaccines obviously don't work.
[2:49:28.180 --> 2:49:29.180]  They haven't worked.
[2:49:29.180 --> 2:49:32.180]  Unless you're trying to get people sick and kill them, then they're working very well.
[2:49:32.180 --> 2:49:33.180]  Oh, exactly right.
[2:49:33.180 --> 2:49:36.180]  So if that's your agenda, then it's perfect, right?
[2:49:36.180 --> 2:49:37.180]  You're loving this.
[2:49:37.180 --> 2:49:38.180]  Yeah, it's doing great.
[2:49:38.180 --> 2:49:40.180]  I love this Sweden.
[2:49:40.180 --> 2:49:41.180]  No lockdowns.
[2:49:41.180 --> 2:49:42.180]  Sweden.
[2:49:42.180 --> 2:49:43.180]  No masks.
[2:49:43.180 --> 2:49:44.180]  I don't need to vaccinate anybody.
[2:49:44.180 --> 2:49:48.180]  Did you see where they actually have banned tourists from Israel?
[2:49:48.180 --> 2:49:49.180]  Yep.
[2:49:49.180 --> 2:49:53.180]  United States in a third country who have more vaccinated people than half of them.
[2:49:53.180 --> 2:49:55.180]  They're like, than half of the populace in those countries.
[2:49:55.180 --> 2:50:00.180]  They don't want people coming into their country because they've been vaccinated and are spreading COVID-19 variants.
[2:50:00.180 --> 2:50:01.180]  Or like Japan too.
[2:50:01.180 --> 2:50:06.180]  And it's amazing when you have a government and leadership that actually cares about its people.
[2:50:06.180 --> 2:50:08.180]  It's amazing how the response is different.
[2:50:08.180 --> 2:50:09.180]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[2:50:09.180 --> 2:50:11.180]  So I mentioned in the break that August 1st was a big date.
[2:50:11.180 --> 2:50:13.180]  People need to know that these boosters aren't working.
[2:50:13.180 --> 2:50:19.180]  Actually, the FDA just actually said on Friday that they don't agree that the boosters in America need to be given out.
[2:50:19.180 --> 2:50:22.180]  They don't think they're effective because they don't want to be part of this death exercise.
[2:50:22.180 --> 2:50:23.180]  That's right.
[2:50:23.180 --> 2:50:24.180]  So this was great actually.
[2:50:24.180 --> 2:50:28.180]  I was impressed that the panel said, we don't think boosters at this time are recommended.
[2:50:28.180 --> 2:50:29.180]  Thank you.
[2:50:29.180 --> 2:50:30.180]  That's great.
[2:50:30.180 --> 2:50:35.180]  But now take it one step further and say that these vaccines are actually killing people, but maybe another day.
[2:50:35.180 --> 2:50:36.180]  That's right.
[2:50:36.180 --> 2:50:41.180]  So just to bring to light some things, August 1st was another big day and very important to me.
[2:50:41.180 --> 2:50:48.180]  So the JAMA, the Journal of American Medical Association, published on August 1st the same day Israel rolled out their booster shots.
[2:50:48.180 --> 2:50:57.180]  They were doing a 7,000 veteran study in VA hospitals around the country for veterans who were treated with remdesivir for COVID-19.
[2:50:57.180 --> 2:51:01.180]  Do you know what the conclusions of this over 7,000 people they evaluated was?
[2:51:01.180 --> 2:51:07.180]  Remdesivir showed zero benefit to beating COVID-19 or treating COVID-19.
[2:51:07.180 --> 2:51:12.180]  It only proved to keep the veterans sicker in the hospitals longer.
[2:51:12.180 --> 2:51:21.180]  And in the last statement, it says that's keeping veterans locking up ICU beds who can't be opened up for other patients who are sick.
[2:51:21.180 --> 2:51:22.180]  Because the drugs are keeping them sick.
[2:51:22.180 --> 2:51:23.180]  Because the drugs are keeping them sick.
[2:51:23.180 --> 2:51:26.180]  That's like a guy that bats zero, literally batting zero.
[2:51:26.180 --> 2:51:30.180]  He's old for lifetime and he's batting clean up in your lineup.
[2:51:30.180 --> 2:51:36.180]  So the veterans of our country are being used as experimentals and they're finding that they don't benefit at all from remdesivir either.
[2:51:36.180 --> 2:51:42.180]  There's zero benefit published in the JAMA report, August 1st, zero benefit of remdesivir.
[2:51:42.180 --> 2:51:46.180]  What was interesting is they didn't go into acute kidney failure and death.
[2:51:46.180 --> 2:51:47.180]  They just said it didn't work.
[2:51:47.180 --> 2:51:48.180]  It's absolutely true.
[2:51:48.180 --> 2:51:49.180]  Remdesivir is not effective.
[2:51:49.180 --> 2:51:50.180]  Ivermectin is.
[2:51:50.180 --> 2:51:51.180]  Hydroxychloroquine is.
[2:51:51.180 --> 2:52:01.180]  Oh, I do want to remind you that the France study they found that are sorry, the World Health Organization database review five months ago in April 2021.
[2:52:01.180 --> 2:52:11.180]  They found that hydroxychloroquine was proven to cause 20 times less acute kidney failure if you treated patients with it around the world for countries using hydroxychloroquine instead of remdesivir.
[2:52:11.180 --> 2:52:13.180]  There are better options.
[2:52:13.180 --> 2:52:14.180]  Early treatment is best.
[2:52:14.180 --> 2:52:16.180]  I'm just going to state it here.
[2:52:16.180 --> 2:52:20.180]  My goal has been to educate people as much as possible to protect them and prevent them from going into the hospitals.
[2:52:20.180 --> 2:52:24.180]  There are places to get Ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine to be prescribed to you.
[2:52:24.180 --> 2:52:26.180]  There's also you need to be on zinc.
[2:52:26.180 --> 2:52:30.180]  The benefit of those two drugs are they are zinc ionophores.
[2:52:30.180 --> 2:52:34.180]  If you haven't listened to Zev Zalinko, he educates you very well on this.
[2:52:34.180 --> 2:52:40.180]  The key to beating any viral infection is getting zinc into your cells because it stops viruses from replicating.
[2:52:40.180 --> 2:52:45.180]  And Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine have a benefit of what's called zinc ionophore.
[2:52:45.180 --> 2:52:48.180]  It actually forces more zinc into the cell.
[2:52:48.180 --> 2:52:53.180]  You also need to be supplementing more zinc every day to protect you as we move into this cold season from cold viruses,
[2:52:53.180 --> 2:52:56.180]  which are coronaviruses that we're exposed to forever.
[2:52:56.180 --> 2:52:58.180]  Influenza viruses is all proven to do that.
[2:52:58.180 --> 2:53:00.180]  So early treatment is best.
[2:53:00.180 --> 2:53:03.180]  I just have to ask you this also, Owen.
[2:53:03.180 --> 2:53:07.180]  The majority of all Americans that are dying from supposedly COVID-19, which I told you it's renal failure,
[2:53:07.180 --> 2:53:10.180]  causing secondary COVID pneumonia, which is really pulmonary edema.
[2:53:10.180 --> 2:53:11.180]  Read the charts.
[2:53:11.180 --> 2:53:13.180]  All your loved ones are doing it.
[2:53:13.180 --> 2:53:19.180]  If you were going to choose a place to die because you were scared ultimately that you're having symptoms of COVID-19,
[2:53:19.180 --> 2:53:24.180]  you believe, and you think the big worry is you're going to die.
[2:53:24.180 --> 2:53:28.180]  And this is your decision to either go to the hospital or to stay home.
[2:53:28.180 --> 2:53:35.180]  The majority of everyone who has died has been treated in ICUs and not allowed to be with their families.
[2:53:35.180 --> 2:53:36.180]  Kept prisoner.
[2:53:36.180 --> 2:53:44.180]  Less than 1% of all world infected COVID-19 patients, less than 1% have died being infected with COVID-19.
[2:53:44.180 --> 2:53:47.180]  Your chances of survival are better if you stay home.
[2:53:47.180 --> 2:53:51.180]  I couldn't even imagine if I pulled the entire world.
[2:53:51.180 --> 2:53:54.180]  If you were to pass away or thought you were going to be on your death bed,
[2:53:54.180 --> 2:53:56.180]  would you rather be with your family or without them?
[2:53:56.180 --> 2:53:58.180]  If you go into an ICU, you will not be with them.
[2:53:58.180 --> 2:54:00.180]  You're going to be intubated.
[2:54:00.180 --> 2:54:01.180]  You're going to be unconscious.
[2:54:01.180 --> 2:54:05.180]  You're not going to be able to communicate with them in a cold, sterile environment where you're being poisoned to death.
[2:54:05.180 --> 2:54:06.180]  Stay home.
[2:54:06.180 --> 2:54:07.180]  Early treatment works.
[2:54:07.180 --> 2:54:08.180]  There's access to places.
[2:54:08.180 --> 2:54:12.180]  In fact, Ben Marble of MyFreeDoctor.com will be in the studio on Wednesday.
[2:54:12.180 --> 2:54:17.180]  He can teach you about MyFreeDoctor.com, how they help you get prescriptions around the country in all 50 states,
[2:54:17.180 --> 2:54:19.180]  synergy health, DPC.
[2:54:19.180 --> 2:54:25.180]  They actually can help you get prescriptions and they actually ship them directly to you from compound pharmacies from around the country.
[2:54:25.180 --> 2:54:27.180]  So there are access to these things.
[2:54:27.180 --> 2:54:28.180]  Go get them.
[2:54:28.180 --> 2:54:29.180]  And you want them preventively.
[2:54:29.180 --> 2:54:31.180]  You want them prophylactically.
[2:54:31.180 --> 2:54:36.180]  There's access to these things that can save you from going to what I consider the modern day death camps,
[2:54:36.180 --> 2:54:38.180]  which are ICUs and hospitals.
[2:54:38.180 --> 2:54:44.180]  Well, and this is the sad part about it is the media and Fauci and others drove this fear-mongering home.
[2:54:44.180 --> 2:54:46.180]  So the average person just thinks, oh, I got a cough.
[2:54:46.180 --> 2:54:47.180]  I got the sniffles.
[2:54:47.180 --> 2:54:48.180]  I better go to a hospital.
[2:54:48.180 --> 2:54:49.180]  I'm going to die.
[2:54:49.180 --> 2:54:50.180]  And that was never the case.
[2:54:50.180 --> 2:54:53.180]  It was always a 99.9% chance you were going to survive.
[2:54:53.180 --> 2:54:56.180]  And I think the obvious question that if people were being honest,
[2:54:56.180 --> 2:55:04.180]  that yeah, I'd much rather be at home if I'm going to die with access to my loved ones instead of being poisoned in the hospital where I get treated like a prisoner.
[2:55:04.180 --> 2:55:05.180]  But you know what?
[2:55:05.180 --> 2:55:08.180]  I think you need to rehash this because this is so key.
[2:55:08.180 --> 2:55:14.180]  I mean, this is the type of statistic that I think will get people to start thinking of all the COVID deaths.
[2:55:14.180 --> 2:55:20.180]  What is the percentage of people that died of COVID in hospitals?
[2:55:20.180 --> 2:55:24.180]  So in hospitals, it's got to be at least 99% because that's where everybody went when they got seriously sick.
[2:55:24.180 --> 2:55:26.180]  I mean, to me, that's everything right there.
[2:55:26.180 --> 2:55:27.180]  Where did they die?
[2:55:27.180 --> 2:55:28.180]  What's killing people?
[2:55:28.180 --> 2:55:29.180]  COVID or the hospital?
[2:55:29.180 --> 2:55:31.180]  They're in ICUs.
[2:55:31.180 --> 2:55:32.180]  And what are they doing to them in ICUs?
[2:55:32.180 --> 2:55:39.180]  They're giving them a drug proven to cause acute kidney failure, multiple organ failure, and 31% of everybody you give it to.
[2:55:39.180 --> 2:55:41.180]  It's the whole narrative.
[2:55:41.180 --> 2:55:43.180]  They were able to kill in the first year.
[2:55:43.180 --> 2:55:48.180]  It was less than a year from May 1st to the end of December, 550,000 Americans.
[2:55:48.180 --> 2:55:52.180]  If that isn't holocaust numbers, they did what?
[2:55:52.180 --> 2:55:54.180]  6 million in six years?
[2:55:54.180 --> 2:56:02.180]  You've got over 690,000 Americans dead in ICUs this year in the last 16 months.
[2:56:02.180 --> 2:56:10.180]  That does not include the vaccine deaths that are hugely unreported in VARS and at the CMS.gov website database.
[2:56:10.180 --> 2:56:17.180]  CMS had a whistleblower that 45,000 CMS Medicare and Medicaid services database.
[2:56:17.180 --> 2:56:26.180]  Within three days post the shots in America, already 45,000 reported dead in three days post their vaccines.
[2:56:26.180 --> 2:56:34.180]  And those don't even make it to the VARS reports because as of September 10th, it still only says 15,000 have died from vaccines in 2021,
[2:56:34.180 --> 2:56:40.180]  which is still like a 10,000% increase on the VARS reports from every other year.
[2:56:40.180 --> 2:56:42.180]  And so we're going to come back.
[2:56:42.180 --> 2:56:43.180]  Let's keep you in studio here.
[2:56:43.180 --> 2:56:48.180]  Gerald Salente patiently waiting to host the fourth hour, but I got to keep doctor artists here because I got a few more questions for him,
[2:56:48.180 --> 2:56:54.180]  including why do you believe they are pushing these vaccines on children?
[2:56:54.180 --> 2:56:57.180]  What do you think the side effects of that are going to be?
[2:56:57.180 --> 2:57:06.180]  And then also we should also get into how they are basically manipulating the system so they can get the numbers to be reported on the media to say,
[2:57:06.180 --> 2:57:08.180]  see the hospitals are overwhelmed.
[2:57:08.180 --> 2:57:09.180]  It's all your fault.
[2:57:09.180 --> 2:57:10.180]  You didn't get a vaccine.
[2:57:10.180 --> 2:57:11.180]  It's all your fault.
[2:57:11.180 --> 2:57:12.180]  You didn't wear a mask.
[2:57:12.180 --> 2:57:13.180]  It's all total BS.
[2:57:13.180 --> 2:57:16.180]  They're rigging the hospitals so they can get these numbers.
[2:57:16.180 --> 2:57:19.180]  So Dr. Artis is going to be with us for at least five more minutes, maybe 20 more minutes.
[2:57:19.180 --> 2:57:25.180]  If Dr. or Gerald Salente doesn't mind holding the folks, remember info wars store.com is how we're able to do this.
[2:57:25.180 --> 2:57:32.180]  No, I don't know if Dr. Artis has been on any other big platforms to bring you this news, probably not for over an hour to talk about it.
[2:57:32.180 --> 2:57:34.180]  That's why info wars has to be on air.
[2:57:34.180 --> 2:57:37.180]  So tell your friends and family about the broadcast.
[2:57:37.180 --> 2:57:47.180]  Tell them about the video archives that banned out video and please shop at info wars store.com so that we can continue to bring you these guests.
[2:57:47.180 --> 2:57:51.180]  Biden and his corporate controllers are lying to you.
[2:57:51.180 --> 2:57:54.180]  This is not a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[2:57:54.180 --> 2:58:02.180]  This is an engineered virus in a lab that they then injected into the public using their poison vaccine.
[2:58:02.180 --> 2:58:08.180]  So the body then created mutations that actually spread even worse like the Delta variant.
[2:58:08.180 --> 2:58:10.180]  That is scientifically admitted.
[2:58:10.180 --> 2:58:13.180]  That is mainline science and not even debated.
[2:58:13.180 --> 2:58:17.180]  But the general public does not even know that.
[2:58:17.180 --> 2:58:28.180]  So when that criminal with his pedophile crackhead son gets up there on television and tells you that you are to blame because you didn't take your poison shot.
[2:58:28.180 --> 2:58:30.180]  That is a giant lie.
[2:58:30.180 --> 2:58:39.180]  Countries like Israel and Singapore with the highest vaccine rate at the highest death and highest illness rates.
[2:58:39.180 --> 2:58:40.180]  That is the facts.
[2:58:40.180 --> 2:58:47.180]  Get that information out to your friends, family and strangers like your life depends on it because it does.
[2:58:47.180 --> 2:58:52.180]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[2:58:52.180 --> 2:59:02.180]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[2:59:02.180 --> 2:59:12.180]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[2:59:12.180 --> 2:59:19.180]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[2:59:19.180 --> 2:59:22.180]  But there is only two things to do.
[2:59:22.180 --> 2:59:25.180]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[2:59:25.180 --> 2:59:28.180]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[2:59:28.180 --> 2:59:34.180]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[2:59:34.180 --> 2:59:49.180]  So we must prepare, get up to a years worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios and life-saving knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[3:00:04.180 --> 3:00:13.180]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. It's Alex Jones.
[3:00:13.180 --> 3:00:16.180]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[3:00:16.180 --> 3:00:19.180]  I don't know how they're going to get away with this, Dr. Artist.
[3:00:19.180 --> 3:00:22.180]  I really don't. Final five minutes here with Dr. Artist.
[3:00:22.180 --> 3:00:28.180]  Then we've got a breaking news report from Alex Jones coming up and then the always great Gerald Salenty here.
[3:00:28.180 --> 3:00:33.180]  I'll be back hosting the War Room, by the way, and I'll get into all this news and take calls on all this.
[3:00:33.180 --> 3:00:38.180]  Headline out today, Pfizer says COVID-19 vaccine works in kids ages 5 to 11.
[3:00:38.180 --> 3:00:42.180]  Oh, oh, by the way, it's hilarious here.
[3:00:42.180 --> 3:00:49.180]  Because you can go, we already covered this on the NIH website and you can click the trials for Ivermectin or for Remdesivir or all that.
[3:00:49.180 --> 3:00:53.180]  Oh, but you can't for the vaccine because there are no trials.
[3:00:53.180 --> 3:00:59.180]  Oh, but we should give them to kids, even though Pfizer's product, Shantix, just was discovered it had cancer causing ingredients in it.
[3:00:59.180 --> 3:01:04.180]  So, Dr. Artist, final segment here with you. We're going to have you back in studio next week, by the way, on the War Room.
[3:01:04.180 --> 3:01:07.180]  But what do you make of this vaccine now?
[3:01:07.180 --> 3:01:10.180]  Oh, it works for kids. We don't know that, but we say it.
[3:01:10.180 --> 3:01:15.180]  Yeah, this is my issue real quick. I have five children. There's no way I would let any of them get these shots.
[3:01:15.180 --> 3:01:28.180]  But Pfizer is asking the FDA for approval to give all children in America 5 to 11 years old approval by either this month, September 2021, or October next month to give all American children 5 to 11 these shots.
[3:01:28.180 --> 3:01:31.180]  None of them would die from COVID. They probably wouldn't even have a symptom.
[3:01:31.180 --> 3:01:38.180]  Yeah, and I don't know if you know this, but it isn't pushed in the media, but it's actually on the inserts now for Pfizer and Moderna and Johnson & Johnson.
[3:01:38.180 --> 3:01:45.180]  There's a black box warning on there that the media didn't tell you, but they, under the rug, made sure it was put on the inserts.
[3:01:45.180 --> 3:01:54.180]  Yeah, like it's like tiny little print, like there's a black box warning now that says myocarditis is a rare side effect of these shots.
[3:01:54.180 --> 3:02:01.180]  It's actually occurring to teenagers around the country and some teenagers are dying as a result of heart inflammation from these shots.
[3:02:01.180 --> 3:02:09.180]  Johnson & Johnson also has a second black box warning that was put on a few months ago for rare blood clot disorders that we know were announced in the media.
[3:02:09.180 --> 3:02:18.180]  The problem with that is, is my problem is the FDA published a document internally in October. The date was October 22nd, 2020.
[3:02:18.180 --> 3:02:35.180]  And this is actually a report by what's called the CBER division within the FDA, and they pulled the FDA heads in, did a 25-slide presentation on vaccine safety and effectiveness reporting that they were going to be reviewing when the shots come out for COVID-19 two months later in December.
[3:02:35.180 --> 3:02:40.180]  So this report was done by the FDA in the FDA in October.
[3:02:40.180 --> 3:02:54.180]  On that listed document on slide 16, I think we may have showed it here before, I don't know, but on slide 16, it actually lists 22 bullet-pointed known side effects from the shots that were going to be expected to be reported into the government.
[3:02:54.180 --> 3:03:03.180]  This is in October, way before myocarditis was put as a black box warning on all the inserts for the Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson shots now.
[3:03:03.180 --> 3:03:17.180]  This is in October of last year. Myocarditis is listed as one of the side effects they knew were going to be coming from these shots, but they did not put this on the fact sheets that accompanied the vaccines to give the American public informed consent.
[3:03:17.180 --> 3:03:26.180]  But they had a list of a total of over 110 known diseases in these 22 bullet points. By the way, death is on there. Death is on there, miscarriage is on there.
[3:03:26.180 --> 3:03:34.180]  Also, what's called Guillain-Barre syndrome, and this is key. It's the first one on the list. I'm looking at it right here. FDA.
[3:03:34.180 --> 3:03:40.180]  Working list of possible side effects coming from the COVID-19 shots. Guillain-Barre syndrome. Do you know what Guillain-Barre syndrome is?
[3:03:40.180 --> 3:03:42.180]  It's basically paralysis.
[3:03:42.180 --> 3:03:51.180]  Yeah, it's paralyzed limbs, legs, arms, half of your faces in some people. Looks like Bell's palsy or a stroke. But you get this to occur. Guillain-Barre syndrome.
[3:03:51.180 --> 3:03:56.180]  Guillain-Barre syndrome is also a known side effect of flu shots. Go on CDC.gov and you can see it.
[3:03:56.180 --> 3:03:57.180]  It's like number one even.
[3:03:57.180 --> 3:04:04.180]  It's the number one serious side effect. And just so you know, 60% of all people who have this as a side effect never fully recover.
[3:04:04.180 --> 3:04:13.180]  So, oh sorry, 60% with physical therapy will recover. 40% never do within a year. Guillain-Barre syndrome, paralyzing. It's like a polio-like illness.
[3:04:13.180 --> 3:04:24.180]  Now just so you know, the CDC has known that vaccines in children cause paralyzed legs, paralyzed arms, and half of children's faces in some of them.
[3:04:24.180 --> 3:04:39.180]  They call it acute flaccid paralysis since 2001. And they found that a polio-derived child vaccine in Filipino children was the cause for acute flaccid paralysis in children in the Philippines.
[3:04:39.180 --> 3:04:50.180]  2001, that was 20 years ago. 2014, the CDC starts reporting that there's outbreaks across America for acute flaccid myelitis, which is the exact same diagnosis.
[3:04:50.180 --> 3:04:57.180]  It's unbelievable. Dr. Brian Artis, we thank you so much. TheDrArtisShow.com. He's going to be on the war with me next week. Just so much hardcore information.

[3:06:23.180 --> 3:06:38.180]  My dad, particularly my mom's son as well, would take me on Saturdays and Sundays and sometimes on weeknights to the Dallas Library or to the Garland Library or the Rockwell Library or different little libraries because I wanted to look at books.
[3:06:38.180 --> 3:06:50.180]  And my favorite books were always historical books. I wanted to look up the Romans and the Vikings and I wanted to study the Mongols and I wanted to know about ancient China and I wanted to know about the Aztecs.
[3:06:50.180 --> 3:07:01.180]  And so over time I really became somewhat of a history buff. But I've also been fascinated with people's family names, their last names, because there's always so much history in that.
[3:07:01.180 --> 3:07:19.180]  And yesterday I was sitting there thinking about how horrible Anthony Fauci is and all the terrible things he did back in the 1980s covering up what was happening with HIV and blocking good drugs that were treating people almost 100% effectiveness while giving people things like AZT that actually killed them.
[3:07:19.180 --> 3:07:28.180]  That's why Magic Johnson got on AZT at Fauci's recommendation and got off of it because it almost killed him and he's alive today and so many others listened to Fauci and died.
[3:07:28.180 --> 3:07:39.180]  He was the one that did that and how he recommended Rendezavir with the Communist Chinese government a year and a half ago and it killed 50% of the people that took it with organ failure, mainly the kidneys.
[3:07:39.180 --> 3:07:48.180]  So I was thinking, man, I wonder what his family name means because usually that's associated with the type of family you were and traits that kept showing up in families or the type of jobs you did.
[3:07:48.180 --> 3:07:57.180]  So I looked up the Fauci family name and guess what the Fauci family name means? It means the sickle.
[3:07:57.180 --> 3:08:07.180]  You know what the grim reaper carries and I went, you know, that's funny. I studied the 14th century black plague, read four or five books of it over the years, watched documentaries about it.
[3:08:07.180 --> 3:08:18.180]  This is very fascinating. Changed the whole course of our civilization and there are groups of globalists that want to create a new plague they believe and wipe out most of the people and create a new Renaissance.
[3:08:18.180 --> 3:08:36.180]  So I thought, let me look up the Fauci family from Italy. Let me look up Fauci's background because memory was telling me that the grim reaper with a sickle came out of Italy in the 14th century and then spread around Europe and then to Russia and other parts of the world.
[3:08:36.180 --> 3:08:55.180]  And sure enough, I looked it up. The grim reaper with his sickle comes from the 14th century, the black plague in Italy from actually the same region that Fauci's from and people with the name sickle were then associated with death and the grim reaper.
[3:08:55.180 --> 3:09:10.180]  So I likened him to the angel of death that was Joseph Mengele in World War II that ran the Nazi eugenics program for the Rockefellers and IBM that tortured thousands of death himself but also gave the directives that then killed millions in horrible deaths.
[3:09:10.180 --> 3:09:20.180]  The IBM numbers were put on the Jews arms and others that was put into the primitive punch card computers decide who would live and who would die and how long you'd be allowed to live.
[3:09:20.180 --> 3:09:38.180]  And then you see Fauci carrying on the angel of death's program really is kind of his protoge spiritually now today and then to know his name means the sickle and is associated in Italy with the grim reaper and death.
[3:09:38.180 --> 3:09:52.180]  It's really amazing. Even in his name, not just his actions, Anthony Fauci is the modern angel of death and he attends eugenics conferences with David Rockefeller at Ted Turner and others and his call for depopulation.
[3:09:52.180 --> 3:10:10.180]  Just like Bill Gates has and so it's no wonder Bill Gates has worked with them because before Bill Gates was even on the scene, 40 plus years ago Fauci was running secret vaccine programs illegal testing around the world. He didn't just run the modern Wuhan lab that cooked up the coronavirus under his direct gain of function orders, which has now come out.
[3:10:10.180 --> 3:10:28.180]  But the clock is ticking and the walls are closing in and time is running out for Dr. Death or Dr. Mingela 2.0. Let's just call him the little angel of death Fauci. I just thought you might want to know some of the strange history surrounding his name and where the modern grim reaper came from.
[3:10:28.180 --> 3:10:42.180]  You can go back to Exodus in the Bible and hear about the angel of death, but it wasn't until 600 years ago that we got the current grim reaper from the same town region that Dr. Fauci now hails from of the same name.
[3:10:42.180 --> 3:11:00.180]  So I'm Alex Jones reporting for infowars.com and now you know the rest of the story.
[3:11:00.180 --> 3:11:14.180]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente.
[3:11:14.180 --> 3:11:32.180]  Hey, great to be on the Alex Jones show. That's Fauci. Yeah, what Alex Jones said about Amir Sikol. What a piece of garbage he is. And by the way, Alex, when you're looking up names, you have to look up mine because my real last name isn't Salente and they changed it.
[3:11:32.180 --> 3:11:35.180]  You know, all that stuff that happened when immigrants came here.
[3:11:35.180 --> 3:11:48.180]  My real last name is Chalantano. So it's not within E. It's an A and O at the end. And there's a great guy. His name is Andriano Chalantano.
[3:11:48.180 --> 3:12:04.180]  And Andriano Chalantano was the Elvis Presley of Italy. Oh yeah, a real rocking cat. So I must have that in my blood because you know what I say, you better boogie before the lights go out because tomorrow is iffy.
[3:12:04.180 --> 3:12:19.180]  Yeah, but no fun allowed anymore. Nope. You know what it says over there in that, you know, that thing called the Declaration of Independence. Where is it over here?
[3:12:19.180 --> 3:12:34.180]  That I don't have in front of me, but that you have the God given rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
[3:12:34.180 --> 3:12:45.180]  Happiness is a dirty word now. No happiness. Freak out little kids with masks and everybody else. Happiness is gone. Life.
[3:12:45.180 --> 3:12:55.180]  No, no, no, no, no, we'll tell you what to do. And we're in charge. Liberty. No, no, you will not get liberty until you get vaccinated.
[3:12:55.180 --> 3:13:08.180]  Do you believe this is happening in America? A. M. E. R. I. K. A. America, the land of the Nazi fascist communists that are in control.
[3:13:08.180 --> 3:13:19.180]  The morons are in control. The idiots are in control. Yep.
[3:13:19.180 --> 3:13:31.180]  That guy, Don Lemon. Perfect name. Perfect name for that sour little piece of crap. A little nothing of a clown boy with an arrogant attitude.
[3:13:31.180 --> 3:13:41.180]  This is from Yahoo. Don Lemon says unvaccinated people should be shunned or left behind.
[3:13:41.180 --> 3:13:54.180]  CNN's Don Lemon CNN, the crap news network, the cartoon news network, the little low life scummy sucker. Yeah, that guy.
[3:13:54.180 --> 3:14:07.180]  Go back to Howard Trends Journal, February 2020. He's telling his staff to keep hyping the fact the COVID stuff as it broke out in China.
[3:14:07.180 --> 3:14:22.180]  Yeah, look at this little boy. Look at this little jerky, arrogant little. I can't call him by that other word because he probably doesn't have one. Yeah.
[3:14:22.180 --> 3:14:33.180]  Anyway, that sucker told his staff to keep selling the COVID war because their ratings are in the toilet, just where this little crap head's head is because that's what's coming out of his mouth.
[3:14:33.180 --> 3:14:51.180]  You ready? Lemon said that those who refuse the vaccine should be shamed or left behind because they're delaying the progress of the United States in its attempts to defeat the pandemic.
[3:14:51.180 --> 3:15:04.180]  Hey, dumb bell. Hey, little moron, nine. Who's dying of the COVID according to the CDC? 78% of the people are obese or overweight.
[3:15:04.180 --> 3:15:14.180]  Take a look at the cover of your Trends Journal. We're watching. Now, you don't have to take the boat anymore. They're everywhere all over America.
[3:15:14.180 --> 3:15:27.180]  Whales are everywhere. The people who ate it and abetted Trump are stupid because they believed his big lie. Hey, jerk.
[3:15:27.180 --> 3:15:45.180]  Can't say the word head. Trump promoted the vaccine. Idiot moron low life piece of garbage crap and you demo craps. When Trump was promoting it, Harrison Biden said he was over promoting it.
[3:15:45.180 --> 3:15:57.180]  Yeah, there's a lot more on this and we're going to get back in the meantime. Markets are going down. We told you so. We warned you. What's next? Stay tuned.
[3:16:16.180 --> 3:16:40.180]  Hey, everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture? Me too. But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[3:16:40.180 --> 3:16:47.180]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death. You probably already believe that. I certainly do.
[3:16:47.180 --> 3:16:57.180]  So here's the thing. I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[3:16:57.180 --> 3:17:12.180]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at strongerdefence.com. No cures or treatments there. Instead, little known but shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune support product based on that research called

[3:17:42.180 --> 3:18:08.180]  I'll tell you what's life and death. If you don't have freedom of speech, if you don't have the right to be able to communicate, then you don't have a future.
[3:18:08.180 --> 3:18:19.180]  In some ways, when governments take away speech, they then enslave the population and then they finally start exterminating the population. In America, the entire world is going down the tubes because the UN Global's directed great reset.
[3:18:19.180 --> 3:18:32.180]  That's why it's more important than ever that infill war stay on the air and that all of us stay healthy. That's why I'm offering a bunch of our best selling products in 50% off for a limited time only until the end of the month of September.

[3:20:24.180 --> 3:20:30.180]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[3:20:30.180 --> 3:20:41.180]  Hey, great Pete, honey, Alex Jones show. And I was saying about this little clown boy, this little arrogant little boy, Don the Lemonhead.
[3:20:41.180 --> 3:21:03.180]  He goes on, the people who aided and abetted Trump are stupid because they believe his big lie. All right, and I said, going back to the election in 2020, Biden and Harris came out against Trump because he was promoting the vaccine.
[3:21:03.180 --> 3:21:23.180]  This is from the Trends Journal, September 29, 2020, just about a year ago, Lemonhead, but your brain can't go back that far because you got a brain as big as the rest of your little known nothings.
[3:21:23.180 --> 3:21:46.180]  Yep. The polls showed that only 13% of Americans would be willing to take the vaccine upon rollout. Joe Biden and his running mate, Senator Camilla Harris, have raised suspicions about the reliability of any vaccine rolled out before the election.
[3:21:46.180 --> 3:22:02.180]  Hey, this is the same vaccine that you're pushing that, you know, we're losing our patients. We're losing our patients. Oh, yeah, you mean the patients that are dying from the vaccine? Are those the patients talking about?
[3:22:02.180 --> 3:22:20.180]  No. President Trump and his campaign seen effective vaccine as a major boost to his reelection prospects. In May, President Trump announced Operation Warp Speed, which he compared to the US race for the atomic bomb.
[3:22:20.180 --> 3:22:39.180]  The Associated Press reported once there is a viable vaccine, Trump said he would employ quote every plane, truck and soldier to distribute the doses dope head lemon lemon brain.
[3:22:39.180 --> 3:22:54.180]  You sour little crappy boy, you little lying freak. You're on the Cartoon News Network. And boy, you fill it out perfectly, just like the rest of you clowns.
[3:22:54.180 --> 3:23:13.180]  News website stat reported that many demo craps have indicated a swift vaccine approval would be politically motivated by the White House. Harris said she would not trust the vaccine under Trump. Hey, hey, scum head, how come you're selling it now?
[3:23:13.180 --> 3:23:26.180]  It's the same vaccine, you little freak. Oh, and how about your freak on top of you? Oh, I don't mean it like that. Oh, yeah, I think you worked your way up by having freaks on top of you.
[3:23:26.180 --> 3:23:37.180]  I think that's the way the story goes. Didn't you screw yourself up to the top? Oh, yeah. Oh, the guy that was married that you were putting out for I forgot about him.
[3:23:37.180 --> 3:23:44.180]  But oh, yeah, he was a big deal over there in California.
[3:23:44.180 --> 3:23:46.180]  Anyway,
[3:23:46.180 --> 3:23:49.180]  Biden agreed with his running mate.
[3:23:49.180 --> 3:23:57.180]  I trust vaccines, he said. I trust the scientists, but I don't trust Donald Trump.
[3:23:57.180 --> 3:24:08.180]  Politico reported that Trump called out Biden for recklessly endangering lives. Trump said I'm calling on Biden to stop promoting his anti vaccine theories.
[3:24:08.180 --> 3:24:20.180]  Hey, fat mouth, little jerk off over there on CNN. How come you weren't calling out by then? I'll tell you why, because you're a nothing little boy.
[3:24:20.180 --> 3:24:31.180]  You're just a prostitute. That's right. A media whore who gets to pay to put out.
[3:24:31.180 --> 3:24:40.180]  The Axios, Ipsos poll show that there had been a rise in suspicions about taking the vaccine.
[3:24:40.180 --> 3:24:46.180]  Then I'm going to give you our trend forecast. Despite this, this is why you subscribe to the Trends Journal.
[3:24:46.180 --> 3:24:52.180]  Remember, this is September 2020, a year ago.
[3:24:52.180 --> 3:25:05.180]  As we have noted from nations, capitals across globe to Wall Street, the word is that until a COVID vaccine is made available to the public, there will be there will be no strong economic rebound.
[3:25:05.180 --> 3:25:30.180]  Therefore, the faster the vaccine hits the main street, we forecast resistance to get vaccinated will decrease as the major media and politicians promote getting vaccinated as the only way to win the COVID war with virtually no mention of building up one's immune system and getting healthy.
[3:25:30.180 --> 3:25:45.180]  Governments will impose educational and other restrictions on all those who refuse to get vaccinated. There you got it. We had forecast this would happen. And now it's going on.
[3:25:45.180 --> 3:25:50.180]  So that's your lemon story.
[3:25:50.180 --> 3:26:12.180]  CNN confirmed that lemon is fully vaccinated. And lemon compared, you ready for this, the little lemon head compared COVID-19 vaccine to other medical vaccines, so polio or measles, saying that the only reason people feel differently about COVID vaccines is
[3:26:12.180 --> 3:26:30.180]  because of the current political climate, you little jerk, you little arrogant scum, political climate. Hey, I forgot. How about all those people working in elder care facilities?
[3:26:30.180 --> 3:26:51.180]  All those people in Indiana that just quit rather than get vaccinated? Yeah, elder care, elder care workers and people working in the biggest Indiana health facility quitting because they didn't want to get vaccinated.
[3:26:51.180 --> 3:27:12.180]  Oh, you think that because they're Trump supporters? No, no, maybe it's because maybe it's because elder care people workers see the effects day and night of the people that have been vaccinated.
[3:27:12.180 --> 3:27:27.180]  They're not Trump supporters, idiot, little boy, little boy of nothing. And comparing it to the vaccine of polio or measles, mump head.
[3:27:27.180 --> 3:27:41.180]  It's not the same kind of vaccine. It's a gene therapy shot, the first ever injected into human beings. Got it? No, that's too much for you to understand.
[3:27:41.180 --> 3:27:49.180]  You don't have to listen to a minority of people who are being harmful for the greater good. Oh, no, you only have to listen to a majority of people.
[3:27:49.180 --> 3:28:02.180]  Oh, and who are being harmful to the greater good? What greater good? Hey, hey, idiot mind, hey, moron brain, hey, low life, little classless boy, little boy of nothing.
[3:28:02.180 --> 3:28:12.180]  If you're vaccinated, you're all messed up. You're safe. That's right. Who are we arming? Oh, only Trump supporters. You should be happy about that.
[3:28:12.180 --> 3:28:22.180]  They'll all die. Hey, what is the efficacy rate of the vaccine? Oh, according to the Israeli Health Ministry, only 39%.
[3:28:22.180 --> 3:28:28.180]  Why not get it? Hey, three shots. That's right. Three strikes are out.
[3:28:28.180 --> 3:28:36.180]  Cuomo agreed with Lemon, saying the majority cannot be held down by a tyranny of a minority.
[3:28:36.180 --> 3:28:50.180]  Oh, yeah, you must believe the majority. The majority rules. Hey, F you Cuomo, don't you call me a tyrant or a...
[3:28:50.180 --> 3:28:58.180]  Your little brother was a tyrant. Oh, your big brother, gone like you should be, little boy of nothing.
[3:28:58.180 --> 3:29:06.180]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic because I sit there and I beg you for support,
[3:29:06.180 --> 3:29:12.180]  constantly for prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth, and we're all this together.

[3:29:24.180 --> 3:29:30.180]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else. They crippled all the other groups, and we're still here.
[3:29:30.180 --> 3:29:36.180]  And as this whole new world order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up. That's why we've got to be taken off here.
[3:29:36.180 --> 3:29:42.180]  America has got to be taken down. You can't have all these other nations enslaved, and America is still quasi-free.
[3:29:42.180 --> 3:29:47.180]  You can't have info wars has been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.

[3:29:58.180 --> 3:30:08.180]  General Lee. It's General Milley. I just want you to know that Trump tried to overthrow the U.S. government two days ago on January 6.
[3:30:08.180 --> 3:30:16.180]  And I just want you to know I've taken control of the nuclear weapons, and if Trump tries to launch an attack on you, we'll let you know first the attack's coming.
[3:30:16.180 --> 3:30:23.180]  That is from the transcript. Then he called up Pelosi, Schumer, and others to say, I'm loyal to you.
[3:30:23.180 --> 3:30:31.180]  I'm going to protect Trump from using nuclear weapons. When Trump was going for detente with China and North Korea at the time, and Trump's responded saying it's a total lie.
[3:30:31.180 --> 3:30:40.180]  Pelosi's come out and admitted it happened. Hell, she bragged back on January 8 that it took place then, and is saying that she honors Milley and that he's this courageous person.
[3:30:40.180 --> 3:30:48.180]  So are all these other Democrats. So this is the permanent deep state coup that's been in control for a long time now coming out of the shadows publicly.

[3:35:30.180 --> 3:35:49.180]  America is struggling to keep up with other countries in exercise. General health during pandemic. This is from CNN, a CNBC, excuse me, New York.
[3:35:49.180 --> 3:36:06.180]  A credible survey shows Americans aren't losing weight or feeling as energized during the day as much as others from across the world.
[3:36:06.180 --> 3:36:23.180]  Look at the cover of the Trends Journal. We're watching. It's on land and on sea. You don't have to take a boat to see it. Who's watching whom? Look what this country's become.
[3:36:23.180 --> 3:36:42.180]  When I was a young guy back in 1963, about 3.6% of America was obese. You know what the number is today?
[3:36:42.180 --> 3:37:07.180]  Over 42% from 3.6 back then in 63, 42%. Yeah. Oh, and this is costing us, by the way, because these are the people that go to hospitals that drive up the costs of health care.
[3:37:07.180 --> 3:37:18.180]  So I want to have a fat tax. The more you weigh, the more you pay. You want to do what you want to do. You know, fine, I don't want to pay for this.
[3:37:18.180 --> 3:37:29.180]  The more you weigh, the more you pay. The hospital is 78% to fill with these people. That's according to the CDC.
[3:37:29.180 --> 3:37:40.180]  So going back, getting the best shape you can and support info wars because they have the products that you need and you want to learn how to fight.
[3:37:40.180 --> 3:37:56.180]  I suggest you go to attackproof.com. Attackproof.com. That's what I learned out. One of the ways I learned out with John Perkins, not that John Perkins, the real John Perkins, who was a student of Bradley Steiner who passed away.
[3:37:56.180 --> 3:38:08.180]  So this is the top guy that's alive now. And you can find him again on attackproof.com. Physically, emotionally, you've got to be in that fight.
[3:38:08.180 --> 3:38:19.180]  You have to be in good health and spiritually. You keep, look, I'm not the same guy was when I was a young guy. You keep learning and trying to get better.
[3:38:19.180 --> 3:38:30.180]  So whatever it is, oh, and by the way, these new age places, what a joke they've turned into. I believed in them, used to support them, went to them and learned things from them.
[3:38:30.180 --> 3:38:40.180]  Now, if you want to go to the Omega Institute over here in Rheinbeck, where I used to go all the time, you've got to be vaccinated. New age.
[3:38:40.180 --> 3:38:48.180]  Hey, you want to go to Esalen on the other side of the country over there? I used to go there all the time, not all the time, many times.
[3:38:48.180 --> 3:38:59.180]  Yep, right up there in Big Sur, overlooking the O's. Beautiful. Got to get the jab. New age. You're old age and dead.
[3:38:59.180 --> 3:39:04.180]  So it's up to you and Info Wars has great products to help you.
[3:39:04.180 --> 3:39:17.180]  And hey, I'm not making this up. Salad Chain CEO, this was about a couple of weeks ago, draws backlash over comments about COVID-19 pandemic and obesity.
[3:39:17.180 --> 3:39:19.180]  This is from USA Today.
[3:39:19.180 --> 3:39:29.180]  Jonathan Newman, co-founder and CEO of Sweetgreen, a popular salad chain, faced backlash on social media this week after posting that no vaccine or mask will save us.
[3:39:29.180 --> 3:39:34.180]  And connecting individuals are obese and overweight with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
[3:39:34.180 --> 3:39:50.180]  Newman said, in a since deleted LinkedIn post, you little coward, you little coward, you deleted it. Coward boy, coward boy, little coward Newman.
[3:39:50.180 --> 3:39:54.180]  Hey, maybe Newman, yeah, gruesome noosa, maybe you're related.
[3:39:54.180 --> 3:40:05.180]  Anyway, he said, we cannot run away from it. COVID is here to stay for the foreseeably future. We cannot run away from it.
[3:40:05.180 --> 3:40:10.180]  However, he noted that he's vaccinated and encourages other to get vaccinated.
[3:40:10.180 --> 3:40:15.180]  78% of hospitalizations due to COVID are obese.
[3:40:15.180 --> 3:40:22.180]  And overweight people, Newman said, in the coward who took his LinkedIn post off.
[3:40:22.180 --> 3:40:27.180]  Is there any underlying problem that perhaps we have not given enough attention to?
[3:40:27.180 --> 3:40:34.180]  Is there another way to think about how we have health care by addressing the root cause?
[3:40:34.180 --> 3:40:37.180]  Journalists and others on social media.
[3:40:37.180 --> 3:40:40.180]  Journalists, oh, you mean like that little prostitute?
[3:40:40.180 --> 3:40:51.180]  You're all prostitutes, you're media whores that get paid to put out by your corporate pimps and your government whore masters around the world.
[3:40:51.180 --> 3:41:02.180]  Journalists and others on social media criticize Newman's argument on Wednesday, accusing him of shaming overweight, obese people, regardless of their vaccination status.
[3:41:02.180 --> 3:41:11.180]  Others call the comments out of touch with food that is accessible for low income individuals and families.
[3:41:11.180 --> 3:41:16.180]  You know what that is? That's BS.
[3:41:16.180 --> 3:41:28.180]  Low income, huh? I could feed four people to seven dollars by making a wonderful resort, though.
[3:41:28.180 --> 3:41:37.180]  Or a pasta, yeah, with broccoli and anchovies and olives.
[3:41:37.180 --> 3:41:43.180]  Oh, yeah. Maybe less than six or seven bucks.
[3:41:43.180 --> 3:41:48.180]  Oh, but you could buy the crap at the junk food places, huh?
[3:41:48.180 --> 3:41:51.180]  Is that what you're talking about? No.
[3:41:51.180 --> 3:41:54.180]  Obesity, rich and poor.
[3:41:54.180 --> 3:41:57.180]  I told you I was, yeah, that's it.
[3:41:57.180 --> 3:41:59.180]  Double it down, sip it down.
[3:41:59.180 --> 3:42:01.180]  I was in Cape May, New Jersey.
[3:42:01.180 --> 3:42:07.180]  That's what gave me the idea for the Trends Journal cover.
[3:42:07.180 --> 3:42:10.180]  Yep.
[3:42:10.180 --> 3:42:13.180]  These are the people telling us what to do.
[3:42:13.180 --> 3:42:17.180]  Again, this is a middle class, upper middle class place, Cape May.
[3:42:17.180 --> 3:42:28.180]  No poor people, but whales all around the town didn't have to go in the water to see them.
[3:42:28.180 --> 3:42:30.180]  We have to get in shape.
[3:42:30.180 --> 3:42:34.180]  America's going down hard and heavy.
[3:42:34.180 --> 3:42:46.180]  We're in the fight for our lives to support info war because they have products that can help you improve your life in a very healthy manner.
[3:42:46.180 --> 3:42:58.180]  So go to info wars stores dot com info wars store dot com and get the products that can help you win the covid war.
[3:42:58.180 --> 3:43:11.180]  The ultimate fluoride free charcoal mouthwash is now available at info wars store dot com and Dr. Jones naturals dot com for the lowest price possible to complete your daily mouth cleaning routine.

[3:44:14.180 --> 3:44:21.180]  The overseas phone line system that he knew was being watched by the star government with the five eyes of the Russians and the Chinese.
[3:44:21.180 --> 3:44:27.180]  He wanted the world to know that he was proud of what he was doing because he was backed by the deep state.
[3:44:27.180 --> 3:44:38.180]  This permanent bureaucracy sees America as its enemy. It sees the American people as its enemy. It sees prosperity as its enemy and it conspired with the Communist Chinese to threaten them basically and say,
[3:44:38.180 --> 3:44:46.180]  Trump may nuke you, but if he tries, we'll call and say we're attacking you so you can respond first. That's beyond treason.
[3:44:46.180 --> 3:44:58.180]  But it shows the type of anti-American sycophants living in their own fetid bubble. They try to get away with this. Millie and all of his accomplices seem to go to prison now for life.
[3:44:58.180 --> 3:45:05.180]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point. It's very bittersweet. Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[3:45:05.180 --> 3:45:09.180]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that. I care about beating the new world order.
[3:45:09.180 --> 3:45:14.180]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[3:45:14.180 --> 3:45:20.180]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons. I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this.
[3:45:20.180 --> 3:45:24.180]  We're going to see this through to the end. We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[3:45:24.180 --> 3:45:31.180]  So please pray for us and please buy the products and then for store dot com. They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[3:45:31.180 --> 3:45:36.180]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great. Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't.
[3:45:36.180 --> 3:45:42.180]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[3:45:42.180 --> 3:45:47.180]  That's why the globalists are censoring. They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[3:45:47.180 --> 3:45:50.180]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[3:45:50.180 --> 3:45:58.180]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[3:45:58.180 --> 3:46:07.180]  I'll tell you what's life and death. If you don't have freedom of speech, if you don't have the right to be able to communicate, then you don't have a future.
[3:46:07.180 --> 3:46:13.180]  Always when governments take away speech, they then enslave the population and then they finally start exterminating the population.
[3:46:13.180 --> 3:46:19.180]  And America, the entire world is going down the tubes because the UN Globals directed great reset.
[3:46:19.180 --> 3:46:23.180]  That's why it's more important than ever that info or stay on the air and that all of us stay healthy.
[3:46:23.180 --> 3:46:31.180]  That's why I'm offering a bunch of our best selling products at 50% off for a limited time only until the end of the month of September.
[3:46:31.180 --> 3:46:35.180]  That's only about 12, 13 days as of the time we're taping this.
[3:46:35.180 --> 3:46:41.180]  And that means all of these amazing products. We have ultra 12, highest quality B12 taken out of the tongue.
[3:46:41.180 --> 3:46:45.180]  We have winter sun, highest quality organic vitamin D3 taken out of the tongue. Amazing.
[3:46:45.180 --> 3:46:49.180]  We've got knock out the sleep pay. We've got hair and beard formula that's got all the vitamins and minerals as well.
[3:46:49.180 --> 3:46:55.180]  And not just hair and beard. And we've got our great liquid turmeric formula all 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[3:46:55.180 --> 3:47:20.180]  And it keeps us on the air. Take action. I thank you.
[3:47:25.180 --> 3:47:31.180]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:31.180 --> 3:47:37.180]  And now your host, Gerald Salente.
[3:47:37.180 --> 3:47:40.180]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:40.180 --> 3:47:46.180]  And as I said, do what you can to support Infowars with their great products because it's fine.
[3:47:46.180 --> 3:47:50.180]  You better get in the best shape you can. This is terrible what's going on.
[3:47:50.180 --> 3:47:56.180]  And again, Infowars stores, they got great vitamins.
[3:47:56.180 --> 3:47:59.180]  They got the top of the top lines there.
[3:47:59.180 --> 3:48:04.180]  And again, when you look at the shape of this country, it's going down.
[3:48:04.180 --> 3:48:08.180]  It's going down hard and heavy.
[3:48:08.180 --> 3:48:11.180]  So to win the fight, you better be in good shape.
[3:48:11.180 --> 3:48:16.180]  I want to talk about the markets a little bit. The Dow is down today over 900 points.
[3:48:16.180 --> 3:48:24.180]  The hang sang over there that was down. It really took a dive in overnight down over 3%.
[3:48:24.180 --> 3:48:27.180]  Europe stocks down over an hour or 2%.
[3:48:27.180 --> 3:48:34.180]  This comes as no surprise to you listening to me on Infowars and, of course, the subscribers of the Trends Journal.
[3:48:34.180 --> 3:48:40.180]  Matter of fact, it could go to a couple of shows I was on recently, Max Kaiser on Infowars.
[3:48:40.180 --> 3:48:47.180]  And Robert Kurosaki on Rich Dad. Boy, what a show.
[3:48:47.180 --> 3:48:51.180]  Rich Dad.com. You got to see that one. And again, this inflation is real.
[3:48:51.180 --> 3:48:54.180]  I've been saying this. It's happening.
[3:48:54.180 --> 3:48:58.180]  Now, I want to make this clear. The markets were down over 900.
[3:48:58.180 --> 3:49:02.180]  As we're now, they're down about 720 something.
[3:49:02.180 --> 3:49:08.180]  Gold is up not as much as I should see it going up, but it's up over 11 bucks.
[3:49:08.180 --> 3:49:13.180]  They're going to do everything to artificially prop up this market.
[3:49:13.180 --> 3:49:18.180]  There's no relationship to reality.
[3:49:18.180 --> 3:49:21.180]  They use arrogant terms like plunge protection team.
[3:49:21.180 --> 3:49:23.180]  Plunge protection team?
[3:49:23.180 --> 3:49:26.180]  Well, buddies will lose the money. We've got to rig it.
[3:49:26.180 --> 3:49:28.180]  We're going to give it a good name.
[3:49:28.180 --> 3:49:37.180]  And the morons and the imbeciles that vote for the crime syndicate call the Republicans and the Democrats to swallow our crap.
[3:49:37.180 --> 3:49:44.180]  You know, the point being is that the markets could be crashing and they will do anything, anything to save them.
[3:49:44.180 --> 3:49:49.180]  Meanwhile, the whole general economy is going down big time.
[3:49:49.180 --> 3:49:53.180]  Conventions trade shows. No, we're fearful. We're not doing them anymore.
[3:49:53.180 --> 3:49:56.180]  They're hardly doing them at all. Restaurant business going down.
[3:49:56.180 --> 3:50:00.180]  Hospitality sector way off. Hey, how about that?
[3:50:00.180 --> 3:50:02.180]  Oh, yeah. People flying.
[3:50:02.180 --> 3:50:09.180]  Like they used to numbers down back to May. Business travel food.
[3:50:09.180 --> 3:50:13.180]  Oh, commercial real estate. How many people are working in New York City?
[3:50:13.180 --> 3:50:18.180]  Oh, 22 percent occupancy rate. All the businesses that depended on them.
[3:50:18.180 --> 3:50:20.180]  And that's in New York. It's Boston.
[3:50:20.180 --> 3:50:24.180]  Oh, over there, the geeky, freaky little boys of nothing.
[3:50:24.180 --> 3:50:33.180]  These little guys with Cajones, probably smaller than a mothball, that little sucker, Berg or that cook.
[3:50:33.180 --> 3:50:42.180]  But another guy, piece of whatever it is, or pit crap, whatever it is for Google.
[3:50:42.180 --> 3:50:47.180]  Yeah, the occupancy rate over there in the offices is 20 percent.
[3:50:47.180 --> 3:50:51.180]  Twenty percent because they're the first ones to freak everybody out.
[3:50:51.180 --> 3:50:54.180]  I can go back. It's in your Trends Journal.
[3:50:54.180 --> 3:50:58.180]  Last February, 2020, when they were selling the fear in hysteria,
[3:50:58.180 --> 3:51:02.180]  he was the first to tell the workers and the others to work at home.
[3:51:02.180 --> 3:51:06.180]  Work at home because this way our business will really zoom and boom.
[3:51:06.180 --> 3:51:12.180]  Yeah, got it. They were the first to close down.
[3:51:12.180 --> 3:51:18.180]  So the markets are not related to reality.
[3:51:18.180 --> 3:51:23.180]  But at some point, they're going to bubble up and burst.
[3:51:23.180 --> 3:51:26.180]  They're way overvalued. They're P.E. ratios.
[3:51:26.180 --> 3:51:28.180]  You know, all time highs. You ready?
[3:51:28.180 --> 3:51:37.180]  I mean, I'm not making this stuff up today in the Wall Street Journal.
[3:51:37.180 --> 3:51:43.180]  Market the junk debt rallies.
[3:51:43.180 --> 3:51:48.180]  Oh, junk debt, huh?
[3:51:48.180 --> 3:51:52.180]  Junk debt sales soar toward record year.
[3:51:52.180 --> 3:51:56.180]  The three trillion dollar market for low rated companies debt.
[3:51:56.180 --> 3:52:01.180]  In other words, the debt ain't worth crap.
[3:52:01.180 --> 3:52:08.180]  Is having its best year ever.
[3:52:08.180 --> 3:52:11.180]  You ready?
[3:52:11.180 --> 3:52:16.180]  It tops the previous high for a full year in data.
[3:52:16.180 --> 3:52:21.180]  Going back to I'm not making this up.
[3:52:21.180 --> 3:52:25.180]  2008.
[3:52:25.180 --> 3:52:31.180]  2008. Hey, who was the guy that took out the domain name,
[3:52:31.180 --> 3:52:35.180]  the panic of 08 in 2007?
[3:52:35.180 --> 3:52:39.180]  Oh, yeah, Gerald Solenti.
[3:52:39.180 --> 3:52:43.180]  08.
[3:52:43.180 --> 3:52:46.180]  Merger and acquisition activity.
[3:52:46.180 --> 3:52:48.180]  Record highs.
[3:52:48.180 --> 3:52:50.180]  All the cheap money.
[3:52:50.180 --> 3:52:52.180]  All the cheap money.
[3:52:52.180 --> 3:52:55.180]  Oh, and how about the fed frauds?
[3:52:55.180 --> 3:52:57.180]  Yeah.
[3:52:57.180 --> 3:53:01.180]  The guys didn't know what the deal is that have been buying and shorting
[3:53:01.180 --> 3:53:03.180]  stocks and equities.
[3:53:03.180 --> 3:53:05.180]  You saw that.
[3:53:05.180 --> 3:53:10.180]  Oh, no, it made it into the news and out.
[3:53:10.180 --> 3:53:13.180]  It's one big club and you ain't in it.
[3:53:13.180 --> 3:53:16.180]  My heart, you know why you can't find workers?
[3:53:16.180 --> 3:53:21.180]  Oh, you want I go to Hanifords and I see the people stocking shelves
[3:53:21.180 --> 3:53:27.180]  and I go to Costco, not Costco Home Depot or Lowe's.
[3:53:27.180 --> 3:53:31.180]  My heart breaks when I see the people working at these places.
[3:53:31.180 --> 3:53:33.180]  They have no future.
[3:53:33.180 --> 3:53:35.180]  They have things called grocery stores.
[3:53:35.180 --> 3:53:39.180]  No, no, not chains and the people working in the grocery stores.
[3:53:39.180 --> 3:53:40.180]  You know, I'm going to learn about this.
[3:53:40.180 --> 3:53:43.180]  See what I could learn and I'm going to open up my own business.
[3:53:43.180 --> 3:53:45.180]  You're not going to open up anything anymore.
[3:53:45.180 --> 3:53:48.180]  The bigs have taken over everything.
[3:53:48.180 --> 3:53:53.180]  Needing household income in America in 2020 had his biggest dips since
[3:53:53.180 --> 3:53:55.180]  they've been doing the numbers.
[3:53:55.180 --> 3:53:58.180]  But the billionaires got eight trillion dollars richer.
[3:53:58.180 --> 3:54:00.180]  It was a thing called hardware stores.
[3:54:00.180 --> 3:54:03.180]  Now there are hardly any of them.
[3:54:03.180 --> 3:54:07.180]  Got hardware chains.
[3:54:07.180 --> 3:54:10.180]  It used to be a thing called stationary stores.
[3:54:10.180 --> 3:54:11.180]  We're right over here.
[3:54:11.180 --> 3:54:12.180]  O'Reilly's in Kingston.
[3:54:12.180 --> 3:54:14.180]  I remember it in the nineteen nineties.
[3:54:14.180 --> 3:54:17.180]  God, now it's stationary chains.
[3:54:17.180 --> 3:54:21.180]  And all we are are workers of slave land.
[3:54:21.180 --> 3:54:23.180]  You're working on the chain gang.
[3:54:23.180 --> 3:54:24.180]  Got it?
[3:54:24.180 --> 3:54:27.180]  Got it?
[3:54:27.180 --> 3:54:30.180]  Look at these low life.
[3:54:30.180 --> 3:54:33.180]  The whole thing is rigged.
[3:54:33.180 --> 3:54:36.180]  Again, we're in the fight for our lives.
[3:54:36.180 --> 3:54:39.180]  Look what they did in selling the vaccine.
[3:54:39.180 --> 3:54:41.180]  Yeah, you get your Krispy Kreme.
[3:54:41.180 --> 3:54:50.180]  Oh, Krispy, crappy junk that'll blow you up so you could join the Whale Club.
[3:54:50.180 --> 3:54:53.180]  And then the comedians telling us what to do.
[3:54:53.180 --> 3:54:55.180]  Comedians.
[3:54:55.180 --> 3:55:05.180]  Chris Rock urges fans to get vaccinated as he reveals COVID-19 diagnosis.
[3:55:05.180 --> 3:55:10.180]  Chris Rock has revealed he's tested positive for COVID.
[3:55:10.180 --> 3:55:16.180]  And using his diagnosis to encourage others to get vaccinated.
[3:55:16.180 --> 3:55:27.180]  The former Saturday Night Live Star added that first he said he just found out that I have COVID.
[3:55:27.180 --> 3:55:37.180]  Get vaccinated.
[3:55:37.180 --> 3:55:50.180]  Comedian Alan Gray, who worked, whom Rock worked with during a special.
[3:55:50.180 --> 3:55:56.180]  He, this guy had gotten vaccinated before.
[3:55:56.180 --> 3:56:03.180]  He dubbed himself Two Shots Rock.
[3:56:03.180 --> 3:56:06.180]  Two Shots Rock, a Rockhead.
[3:56:06.180 --> 3:56:09.180]  You got vaccinated.
[3:56:09.180 --> 3:56:11.180]  And now you got COVID.
[3:56:11.180 --> 3:56:17.180]  And you are telling people that trust me, you don't want this.
[3:56:17.180 --> 3:56:20.180]  And you got it after getting vaccinated.
[3:56:20.180 --> 3:56:22.180]  And now you're selling the vaccination.
[3:56:22.180 --> 3:56:25.180]  What are you getting paid off?
[3:56:25.180 --> 3:56:30.180]  Or are you really a comedian and you have no other brain in your head?
[3:56:30.180 --> 3:56:32.180]  Get it straight.
[3:56:32.180 --> 3:56:36.180]  You got vaccinated.
[3:56:36.180 --> 3:56:38.180]  Two Shot Rock.
[3:56:38.180 --> 3:56:41.180]  So.
[3:56:41.180 --> 3:56:45.180]  So to start and clarify, if he was Delta variant, he's fully vaccinated.
[3:56:45.180 --> 3:56:54.180]  In May Rock joke during multiple talk shows, appearance about cutting the line to the fast track to get his shot quote.
[3:56:54.180 --> 3:56:55.180]  I don't care.
[3:56:55.180 --> 3:56:57.180]  I use my celebrity Jimmy.
[3:56:57.180 --> 3:57:00.180]  He told Jimmy Fallon during a visit to the Tonight Show.
[3:57:00.180 --> 3:57:02.180]  Like step aside, Betty White.
[3:57:02.180 --> 3:57:04.180]  Step aside, old people.
[3:57:04.180 --> 3:57:12.180]  I did hootie tang hootie tang crap head.
[3:57:12.180 --> 3:57:14.180]  The futures in your hands.
[3:57:14.180 --> 3:57:15.180]  Don't drop it.
[3:57:15.180 --> 3:57:18.180]  You can see what's going on over here.
[3:57:18.180 --> 3:57:20.180]  They want to vaxx us to death.
[3:57:20.180 --> 3:57:21.180]  Oh, yeah.
[3:57:21.180 --> 3:57:26.180]  You don't want to get this get vaccinated like Two Shot Rockhead.
[3:57:26.180 --> 3:57:36.180]  Shout out and you could take the SHOT and I would say put an eye in there because it's a lot of crap that you're spewing out.
[3:57:36.180 --> 3:57:43.180]  Again, support info was and the Trends Journal last week's 162 pages of book to read what you want.
[3:57:43.180 --> 3:57:44.180]  The facts are there.
[3:57:44.180 --> 3:57:45.180]  The futures in your hands.
[3:57:45.180 --> 3:57:49.180]  Don't drop it.
[3:57:49.180 --> 3:57:56.180]  You can see what's going on over here.
[3:57:56.180 --> 3:58:04.180]  The public leaders of nations across the planet are declaring their allegiance to the new world order and Democrat politicians have been announcing it here as well.
[3:58:04.180 --> 3:58:11.180]  That means allegiance to a tyrannical world corporate government established by the Rockefellers through the U.N.
[3:58:11.180 --> 3:58:20.180]  And to have the global digital tracking covid passes or vaccine passes to form the backbone of their new world ID.
[3:58:20.180 --> 3:58:29.180]  And now their puppet bite has announced the forced inoculation of 100 million Americans to keep their jobs in total violation of the Nuremberg code.
[3:58:29.180 --> 3:58:30.180]  This is criminal.
[3:58:30.180 --> 3:58:34.180]  And he's lying saying it's an approved vaccine when they did not approve it.
[3:58:34.180 --> 3:58:38.180]  They say that's a 20, 25, maybe they just expanded the emergency authorization.
[3:58:38.180 --> 3:58:41.180]  That's why the two top scientists quit a week and a half ago.
[3:58:41.180 --> 3:58:45.180]  Well, you live to see an absolute new world order, world government.
[3:58:45.180 --> 3:58:49.180]  If you submit, they will totally enslave you.
[3:58:49.180 --> 3:58:57.180]  When Bob Woodward's new book came out, alleging that General Milley had called the head of the Chinese military and said Trump might nuke you.
[3:58:57.180 --> 3:58:59.180]  He tried to overthrow the U.S. government.
[3:58:59.180 --> 3:59:06.180]  But basically I'm protecting you and I'll warn you if we launch an attack, which was the greatest reason in U.S. history that has ever been committed.
[3:59:06.180 --> 3:59:08.180]  People said, oh, Alex, it must not be true.
[3:59:08.180 --> 3:59:09.180]  And I might wait.
[3:59:09.180 --> 3:59:10.180]  Bob Woodward's former naval intelligence.
[3:59:10.180 --> 3:59:12.180]  He's a big insider globalist.
[3:59:12.180 --> 3:59:15.180]  He wouldn't have put this out unless they wanted to put it out.
[3:59:15.180 --> 3:59:24.180]  Say that Billy was a hero to set the precedent that you can have a permanent bureaucracy stay behind network deep state basically that has its own bureaucratic coup over America.
[3:59:24.180 --> 3:59:25.180]  That's why he put five in.
[3:59:25.180 --> 3:59:28.180]  He's so incredibly weak to undermine the idea of the presidency.
[3:59:28.180 --> 3:59:31.180]  Well, people said I was making it up with Bob Woodward's line.
[3:59:31.180 --> 3:59:33.180]  Well, now Milley admits he did it.
[3:59:33.180 --> 3:59:35.180]  You see, I didn't need to trust Bob Woodward.
[3:59:35.180 --> 3:59:41.180]  I remember Pelosi on January 8th ragging that she got the call for Milley that he take control of the nukes.
[3:59:41.180 --> 3:59:44.180]  So this treason was hiding and playing to you back then and we covered it.
[3:59:44.180 --> 3:59:45.180]  See, I have a memory folks.
[3:59:45.180 --> 3:59:46.180]  I remember all this stuff.
[3:59:46.180 --> 4:00:13.180]  That's why I know it's true and what's false.
[4:00:13.180 --> 4:00:38.180]  That's why I know it's true.
