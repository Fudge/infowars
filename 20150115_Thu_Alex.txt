[00:00.000 --> 00:11.960]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:11.960 --> 00:19.440]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:19.440 --> 00:28.120]  Alex Jones well my friends it's already the 15th of day of the January we're
[00:28.120 --> 00:34.360]  already halfway into the first month of 2015 I'm your host Alex Jones and I've
[00:34.360 --> 00:38.960]  been procrastinating busy with documentary filmmaking the nightly news
[00:38.960 --> 00:44.800]  the radio show family issues you name it in the last year that our new studio has
[00:44.800 --> 00:48.240]  been pretty much finished and that we've been hosting the nightly news out of
[00:48.240 --> 00:53.320]  for about six months to start segueing out of the old little studio that's
[00:53.320 --> 00:59.640]  going to be a voiceover room in the future and a backup studio into the new
[00:59.640 --> 01:04.880]  studio but we are in the new TV studio if you're a radio listener you go to
[01:04.880 --> 01:10.640]  infowars.com forward slash show or prisonplanet.tv members also have the
[01:10.640 --> 01:14.440]  higher def feed and we'll get the commercial free podcast later today
[01:14.440 --> 01:20.440]  you'll be able to see it all there at prisonplanet.tv as well and of course
[01:20.440 --> 01:25.720]  we're not really presenting this in television so you get to look at yours
[01:25.720 --> 01:30.400]  truly you I need to actually pay you to do that I understand that I think I've
[01:30.400 --> 01:35.720]  got a face for radio sometimes but the reason we are television is we can show
[01:35.720 --> 01:40.400]  you video clips we can show you the news articles we can show you the documents
[01:40.400 --> 01:46.320]  we can have our guest in studio and you can get a chance to basically add
[01:46.320 --> 01:52.040]  several layers of informational awareness to that and I know that goes
[01:52.040 --> 01:59.680]  without saying infowars.com going back more than ten years ago pioneered not
[01:59.680 --> 02:05.880]  just having a webcam that I've had since 1997 when Limbaugh and other folks
[02:05.880 --> 02:08.960]  started doing them as well we are trailblazers when it comes to adding
[02:08.960 --> 02:14.680]  video to radio folks say I watch you on the radio people say what do you mean we
[02:14.680 --> 02:20.320]  watch well it's a radio format of talk radio teleprompter free talking point
[02:20.320 --> 02:24.840]  free where we just break down the analysis take calls have guests but then
[02:24.840 --> 02:32.080]  you add a television section to it where it's then live real television as well
[02:32.080 --> 02:36.680]  so the heart is radio and the heart of the audience the vast majority is audio
[02:36.680 --> 02:40.320]  whether it's AM and FM affiliates or 600 plus thousand people that download the
[02:40.320 --> 02:45.200]  podcast every day or people that listen to the audio streams by the hundreds of
[02:45.200 --> 02:49.560]  thousands then you have tens of million each week that watch the show via YouTube
[02:49.560 --> 02:55.000]  other platforms still the heart of it is a radio transmission and then built
[02:55.000 --> 03:01.360]  around that really the original non dinosaur media the first broadcast
[03:01.360 --> 03:07.080]  media was radio but from the beginning it was long-form and not as scripted as
[03:07.080 --> 03:12.040]  when television came in that was kind of dominated by Hollywood and so it was
[03:12.040 --> 03:17.680]  talk radio that led us out of the dark ages of the free speech restrictions of
[03:17.680 --> 03:22.200]  the fairness doctrine and other things that were put in place in the 60s those
[03:22.200 --> 03:26.320]  were overturned in the 80s by good people at the telecommunications
[03:26.320 --> 03:31.760]  commissions and the FCC like constitutional lawyer Bruce Fine and
[03:31.760 --> 03:37.840]  then since then it is the format of talk radio and real analysis long-form
[03:37.840 --> 03:44.840]  breakdown of information that became the model then of new media and the online
[03:44.840 --> 03:54.440]  TV radio shows that are now spreading across the board in media and and
[03:54.440 --> 04:00.240]  really overthrowing the existing a state-run dinosaur system but the
[04:00.240 --> 04:06.880]  establishment is striking back the establishment is more and more trying
[04:06.880 --> 04:10.560]  to buy up the alternative media trying to jam the alternative media with
[04:10.560 --> 04:14.280]  infighting and disinformation but I'm here to tell you it's too little too
[04:14.280 --> 04:20.240]  late because of the fundamentals show in the polling the people not just here
[04:20.240 --> 04:26.400]  but all over the world do not buy into the system anymore they do not trust the
[04:26.400 --> 04:32.160]  system anymore they know fundamentally something's wrong and they've begun to
[04:32.160 --> 04:36.920]  set about trying to find out exactly what's wrong to change that and turn
[04:36.920 --> 04:42.920]  things around and seeking a redress seeking solutions seeking to fix things
[04:42.920 --> 04:48.160]  is the first part of the equation and the rest historically follows because no
[04:48.160 --> 04:53.040]  army can stop an idea whose time has come and it's time to legalize freedom to
[04:53.040 --> 04:57.200]  quote Ron Paul I'm Alex Jones coming to you out of the new studios deep in the

[08:09.880 --> 08:16.040]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the
[08:16.040 --> 08:24.840]  GCN radio network well this should be interesting today I would expect that you
[08:24.840 --> 08:31.120]  might see a few interruptions here in there because we are doing three hours
[08:31.120 --> 08:38.360]  of live radio slash television with a full eight-camera shoot and a full crew
[08:38.360 --> 08:43.680]  today out of the new TV studios and we've got several satellite uplinks ready
[08:43.680 --> 08:48.080]  that I've just got to pull the trigger on we've got ground studios also in
[08:48.080 --> 08:52.920]  Houston and other areas that we can satellite uplink through we have a
[08:52.920 --> 08:58.960]  whole bunch of cable systems and TV stations a huge file of them over the
[08:58.960 --> 09:04.440]  last three years that have contacted us not just here but in Europe that want to
[09:04.440 --> 09:10.400]  put free-to-air this three-hour radio show on and I've just had to build the
[09:10.400 --> 09:15.440]  infrastructure and get ready for it and quite frankly I've been procrastinating
[09:15.440 --> 09:19.160]  because I've been so busy dealing with the three-hour radio show the nightly
[09:19.160 --> 09:24.280]  news making special reports and everything else that I was cozy in my
[09:24.280 --> 09:29.160]  studio I've been in for seven years and before that I was in other radio and TV
[09:29.160 --> 09:34.200]  studios over the last 20 years but now we are shifting in the next few weeks
[09:34.200 --> 09:42.520]  entirely into the new TV studio and of course with the crew who produces the
[09:42.520 --> 09:47.520]  radio show and the nightly news but this is first and foremost a syndicated
[09:47.520 --> 09:52.560]  radio broadcast over a hundred and eighty AM and FM affiliates and we are also of
[09:52.560 --> 09:57.600]  course satellite satellite simulcast on global shortwave WWCR and of course
[09:57.600 --> 10:03.760]  dominant when it comes to political talk radio online at info wars.com and of
[10:03.760 --> 10:08.320]  course prisonplanet.com and prisonplanet.tv everyone listening on the
[10:08.320 --> 10:14.440]  radio who is online can go to the free video feed at info wars.com forward slash
[10:14.440 --> 10:19.720]  show you can find all the free podcast links iPhone and droid apps and so much

[10:24.720 --> 10:31.400]  the listen tab as well but again we are in the new TV studio I simply have to
[10:31.400 --> 10:38.600]  pull the trigger on satellite systems in Atlanta in Houston and everywhere you
[10:38.600 --> 10:43.120]  know they say build it and they will come over the years we've been approached
[10:43.120 --> 10:49.600]  as folks knew we were building this with major outfits that are anti-new world
[10:49.600 --> 10:54.880]  order TV stations local cable systems you name it that are ready to put us on
[10:54.880 --> 11:03.480]  main cable channels other talk show hosts that have gotten on cable you
[11:03.480 --> 11:07.880]  notice either get their own channel but their 500 600 700 or a thousand channels
[11:07.880 --> 11:12.840]  up we have TV and radio stations lined up across the United States that are
[11:12.840 --> 11:18.760]  ready to put us on broadcast TV that are ready to put us on UHF VHF and they're
[11:18.760 --> 11:24.120]  ready to put us on basic cable channels and I have been dragging my feet I
[11:24.120 --> 11:29.600]  apologize to all of those partners who just want to fight the tyrants who
[11:29.600 --> 11:34.440]  believed in us to support us and offer all this and the next month I'm setting
[11:34.440 --> 11:38.360]  the deadline I'm going to sign those agreements most of the stations are
[11:38.360 --> 11:42.480]  going to give a satellite up links for free put us on you know share
[11:42.480 --> 11:48.040]  advertising with us it's extremely exciting what's happening and it's just
[11:48.040 --> 11:52.760]  been so momentous that I've been holding back trying to get everything just
[11:52.760 --> 11:57.280]  right and I realize I've been successful because I never waited to get stuff
[11:57.280 --> 12:01.760]  just right I've always just gone in there knowing I'm fighting for freedom
[12:01.760 --> 12:05.240]  that we're fighting tyrants that I'm not perfect and I've just got to do the
[12:05.240 --> 12:09.800]  best job I can and I want to tell the crew that as well all of them have done
[12:09.800 --> 12:13.480]  just an amazing job we can punch up and show some of the folks in the control
[12:13.480 --> 12:18.440]  room and the entire operation here across the board you can see Leanne
[12:18.440 --> 12:22.440]  McAdoo back there smiling helping run the show we'll be talking to her some
[12:22.440 --> 12:29.080]  later CJ and so many others Nico and Rob do and Marcos and John bounds back
[12:29.080 --> 12:34.880]  there and Richard I mean there's so many people you got Joe look at Leanne it's
[12:34.880 --> 12:39.360]  like she's on the deck of the enterprise except there's m4s cross behind her
[12:39.360 --> 12:45.520]  saying Molan Lobby wonder what that means so there isn't a TV station or
[12:45.520 --> 12:52.040]  network like it and we've been growing for 20 years we're now 20 years and
[12:52.040 --> 12:59.240]  change into the info war here in 2015 and I want to thank all of our AM and
[12:59.240 --> 13:04.840]  FM affiliates out there talk radio is the original alternative media back when
[13:04.840 --> 13:09.640]  the newspapers and broadcast TV was so controlled that's been declassified they
[13:09.640 --> 13:13.360]  tried to put in laws in the 60s the fairness doctrine to restrict free
[13:13.360 --> 13:17.880]  speech on talk radio they would find you or remove you from the air or take your
[13:17.880 --> 13:25.680]  license until it was overturned in 1987 by Ronald Reagan and his appointee to the
[13:25.680 --> 13:32.640]  FCC attorney Bruce Fine who's a guest of ours routinely until that you couldn't
[13:32.640 --> 13:37.120]  have talk radio now they want to bring in fairness doctrine for the internet
[13:37.120 --> 13:44.640]  under FCC control and Obama has had Syspa reintroduced as of yesterday to
[13:44.640 --> 13:48.880]  restrict free speech on the internet in the aftermath of 20 dead in France
[13:48.880 --> 13:55.520]  since when do we get rid of free speech because of 20 dead plus the terrorists
[13:55.520 --> 13:59.280]  were operating publicly on their Facebook and were allowed to fly around
[13:59.280 --> 14:04.120]  even though they were on no fly list so why would we pass laws to restrict free
[14:04.120 --> 14:13.120]  speech and let the sunset on freedom for scum killing people but this is the
[14:13.120 --> 14:18.000]  equation that we're told and then there are demonstrations around the world for
[14:18.000 --> 14:22.840]  free speech and the EU says they're promoting free speech when it's the EU
[14:22.840 --> 14:27.800]  pushing to arrest you if you don't believe in man-made global warming or if
[14:27.800 --> 14:32.920]  you criticize the United Nations or EU unelected bureaucrats now here's what's
[14:32.920 --> 14:39.240]  coming up today in the second hour we have incredibly important mainstream news
[14:39.240 --> 14:44.200]  proof that people are taking the flu shots especially children and dying
[14:44.200 --> 14:52.880]  after they take them we know that's going on we also know that the flu shot
[14:52.880 --> 14:56.920]  itself is causing these so-called mystery illnesses we're going to prove
[14:56.920 --> 15:02.800]  that and document that this is a major public emergency and we're going to be
[15:02.800 --> 15:07.920]  exposing it coming up in the second hour that in a raft of other news with
[15:07.920 --> 15:13.760]  doctor group look at this headline how eating certain beans cuts the risk of
[15:13.760 --> 15:17.640]  these five cancers he's going to be talking about that now we're also going
[15:17.640 --> 15:22.120]  to talk about these five common foods could be making you fat some really
[15:22.120 --> 15:28.880]  important information with doctor group coming up so you'll definitely want to
[15:28.880 --> 15:35.840]  join us for that in the second hour then George Norrie second most syndicated
[15:35.840 --> 15:39.920]  and listened to talk show host in the world with about 18 million listeners a

[15:48.560 --> 15:53.680]  out but more importantly the waterfront 2015 what he sees unfolding this year

[15:58.000 --> 16:03.440]  speech we're also going to talk about comment love joy that's amazing so many
[16:03.440 --> 16:07.720]  people right now we'll cover the waterfront with George Norrie of
[16:07.720 --> 16:15.760]  coast-to-coast-am.com in the third hour today now that said there's no way for me
[16:15.760 --> 16:19.760]  to even tell you what I think the top story is today there's so much so let's
[16:19.760 --> 16:26.600]  just start going to the stacks right now CIA finds no wrongdoing in agency search
[16:26.600 --> 16:31.160]  of computers used by Senate investigators so breaking into senators
[16:31.160 --> 16:34.840]  computers breaking into the investigators investigating the CIA
[16:34.840 --> 16:38.520]  violating the fourth amendment violating the separation of powers
[16:38.520 --> 16:47.720]  violating their bosses the elected representatives this is sick and they're
[16:47.720 --> 16:52.720]  just saying oh it's just a search it's not snooping it's not espionage it's not
[16:52.720 --> 16:59.040]  blackmailing Congress the CIA is basically British intelligence how in the
[16:59.040 --> 17:07.640]  saw the imitation game what's based on a true story and where is I find it very
[17:07.640 --> 17:12.960]  sad what happened to Turig that was a total genius and invented a computer
[17:12.960 --> 17:23.520]  basically decode the Germans enigma system with their ultra system that said
[17:23.520 --> 17:29.360]  the whole movie the backdrop is mi6 is lying to Winston Churchill and is
[17:29.360 --> 17:34.480]  propping up Stalin and protecting communist and it's cute and funny and
[17:34.480 --> 17:37.600]  wonderful it's actually a true story that really happened and wasn't be
[17:37.600 --> 17:43.680]  classified until the 90s but after World War two ended they kept propping up
[17:43.680 --> 17:48.800]  Stalin and then Stalin was giving weapons to Vietnam we had that war it just
[17:48.800 --> 17:54.520]  shows how sick it is but in the movie mi6 basically runs the government and
[17:54.520 --> 18:01.200]  Winston Churchill doesn't which is why Winston Churchill freaked out and said
[18:01.200 --> 18:06.400]  our government's been taken over by communist because it was true just like

[25:43.600 --> 25:50.920]  see what are we gonna do about it I'm not bragging we did a report on this it
[25:50.920 --> 25:56.200]  wasn't hard the Washington Times has now done it months later I'm glad they did
[25:56.200 --> 26:01.160]  we need to do another report on this if you blow up the signs on video and read
[26:01.160 --> 26:05.920]  down at the bottom which nonprofits are funding it they're all George Soros
[26:05.920 --> 26:13.200]  funded we cracked five different signs in New York and in Ferguson with the fight
[26:13.200 --> 26:16.440]  the cops the cops are the problem everything's because the cops did it
[26:16.440 --> 26:19.160]  it's not the government it's not the foreign banks it's not the offshore
[26:19.160 --> 26:23.280]  corporations it's the cops it's the cops you know just just just go after them
[26:23.280 --> 26:27.600]  and that'll fix everything no that'll start a civil war that George Soros can
[26:27.600 --> 26:33.680]  capitalize on like he did when he was 15 hunting down Jews to rob them in
[26:33.680 --> 26:40.840]  Romania and here it is I told you that they did an investigation why I did one
[26:40.840 --> 26:44.720]  we just searched the name of the groups we can see all the pasty white kids out
[26:44.720 --> 26:48.960]  there agitating handing out the signs saying deck the halls with dead cops and
[26:48.960 --> 26:55.360]  all that crap I told you it was Soros I told you I'm sick of it George Soros
[26:55.360 --> 27:01.080]  funds Ferguson protest hopes disperse civil action and at the same time he
[27:01.080 --> 27:04.600]  wants to then demonize peaceful demonstrations and legitimate
[27:04.600 --> 27:10.320]  demonstrations against federalization and militarization of police he's just
[27:10.320 --> 27:17.280]  such a stinking villain and people keep falling for it there's a solidarity man
[27:17.280 --> 27:22.140]  at the finance center in Ferguson protest movement no it's not victim Michael
[27:22.140 --> 27:25.920]  Brown or officer Darren Wilson it's not even Reverend L. Sharpton despite the
[27:25.920 --> 27:34.080]  ubiquitous campaign on TV on the streets oh no rather it's liberal billionaire you
[27:34.080 --> 27:38.200]  mean Nazi collaborator piece of crap excuse me piece of garbage it's liberal
[27:38.200 --> 27:43.600]  billionaire monster demon George Soros they didn't say that it's liberal
[27:43.600 --> 27:48.720]  billionaire George Soros who's built a business empire that dominates across the
[27:48.720 --> 27:52.120]  ocean in Europe while forging a political machine powered by nonprofit
[27:52.120 --> 27:56.360]  foundations that impact American politics and policy not unlike what he did
[27:56.360 --> 28:02.800]  with move on.org yeah he wants your guns too meanwhile parents
[28:02.800 --> 28:07.560]  investigated for neglect after letting kids walk home alone oh yeah don't let
[28:07.560 --> 28:12.080]  your 10-year-old plan the park either so that's the type of news I have in that
[28:12.080 --> 28:19.320]  stack let me now move to the next little part of the stack federal report says
[28:19.320 --> 28:23.880]  border patrols drone program doesn't fly and doesn't stop many illegals well
[28:23.880 --> 28:27.320]  yeah because they're just legalized as soon as they get to the border patrol
[28:27.320 --> 28:30.880]  given vouchers loaded on buses and brought into the United States a
[28:30.880 --> 28:36.560]  Democratic Party controlled areas of course it doesn't work because it's not
[28:36.560 --> 28:40.400]  meant to work the only place you could have aircraft drones whatever is on the
[28:40.400 --> 28:45.160]  border that's the Fed's only jurisdiction is the border to have
[28:45.160 --> 28:49.640]  militarization but of course they won't militarize the border unless it's to keep
[28:49.640 --> 28:53.440]  you from getting out of the country if the IRS says you can't leave and by the
[28:53.440 --> 28:57.640]  way they couldn't get that bill passed in 2014 or 2013 so now they're just
[28:57.640 --> 29:02.440]  announcing under Obamacare regs that you know what we may just not let you leave
[29:02.440 --> 29:10.720]  there's no law who needs a stinking law who needs anything this is rule by fiat
[29:10.720 --> 29:13.440]  and again I go back to this article I mentioned we're gonna go to break into

[29:21.640 --> 29:27.400]  years ago where CPAs are now libel CPAs will give you none of the basic
[29:27.400 --> 29:32.000]  write-offs they will just try to give half your money to the private Federal
[29:32.000 --> 29:35.960]  Reserve collection agency the IRS because they're libel you got to go get a tax
[29:35.960 --> 29:41.200]  lawyer now and it doesn't even matter because there is no law it's just a
[29:41.200 --> 29:44.840]  bunch of criminals and now they won't even tell you how to fill it out because
[29:44.840 --> 29:48.560]  they don't want you to use that as a defense they want to rob you and we're

[33:32.000 --> 33:37.000]  Newsmax hey rabbi I got a better idea how about everybody in Europe's able to
[33:37.000 --> 33:43.200]  carry guns including felons because felons are gonna carry guns any ways so
[33:43.200 --> 33:48.480]  I don't want any gun laws any gun laws other than private property people should
[33:48.480 --> 33:54.520]  be able to restrict it on their private property if they see fit back in the old
[33:54.520 --> 33:59.240]  days even 67 years ago in fact before the 68 gun control act when you got out
[33:59.240 --> 34:03.680]  of prison if you'd been arrested with a gun at the time and you owned it they
[34:03.680 --> 34:09.880]  would give you your gun back famously what is it in high planes drifter with
[34:09.880 --> 34:13.960]  Clint Eastwood when they let the bad guys out of the jail at the beginning of
[34:13.960 --> 34:17.320]  the movie they give them their guns that's how it really worked because a
[34:17.320 --> 34:21.600]  criminal is gonna have a gun anyways you don't take somebody's horse and you don't
[34:21.600 --> 34:25.200]  take somebody's gun that's why you could be executed for stealing somebody's
[34:25.200 --> 34:32.960]  horse because somebody could die if you took their horse now Hollywood sells the
[34:32.960 --> 34:37.520]  image of wall-wall-west high crime you actually study the first hundred years
[34:37.520 --> 34:41.440]  of US history other than wars and infighting crime was very very low
[34:41.440 --> 34:45.200]  because most people were armed and you certainly didn't have people's houses
[34:45.200 --> 34:52.000]  getting robbed but Europe's leading rabbi let Jews carry guns for protection
[34:52.000 --> 34:58.320]  well the head of Interpol said last year which I thought was amazing as
[34:58.320 --> 35:02.760]  Interpol is pretty corrupt in my view when radical Islamists has continued to
[35:02.760 --> 35:07.640]  attack shopping malls around the world including Kenya he said it's now time for
[35:07.640 --> 35:11.000]  law-abiding citizens to be able to have concealed carry and to be armed that
[35:11.000 --> 35:18.320]  will stop this and that's absolutely true imagine if these Islamists would have
[35:18.320 --> 35:24.000]  tried to attack the average business in say Texas where maybe 20% of people are
[35:24.000 --> 35:30.560]  concealed carry it would look like trying to rob a police station instead of a
[35:30.560 --> 35:35.600]  bank you would get your butt shot off a prominent Jewish organization Europe is
[35:35.600 --> 35:39.640]  petitioning the European Union to allow members of the Jewish community to carry
[35:39.640 --> 35:43.520]  guns for the essential protection of their communities that won't be allowed
[35:43.520 --> 35:47.600]  because if that idea came well then other people are gonna want it right but
[35:47.600 --> 35:50.800]  see the feminists say women shouldn't have guns because a woman being in power
[35:50.800 --> 35:54.600]  to protect themselves that that's not feminist of course it's completely
[35:54.600 --> 36:00.040]  feminist it's beyond feminist it's human see see they want your guns to
[36:00.040 --> 36:03.520]  enslave you and I know our listeners know that but the general public still
[36:03.520 --> 36:07.800]  doesn't completely get it they're starting to the system arms of the teeth
[36:07.800 --> 36:13.760]  while telling us we should turn our guns in the European Jewish Association is
[36:13.760 --> 36:17.560]  pressing for new legislation that would change the gun license laws which are
[36:17.560 --> 36:20.880]  basically impossible in Europe to get guns after a series of deadly attacks on
[36:20.880 --> 36:24.920]  Jews across Europe most recently during the Paris terrorist hostage siege which
[36:24.920 --> 36:31.120]  killed four Jews in the kosher market yeah in Israel pretty much anybody can
[36:31.120 --> 36:37.560]  get an M16 to protect themselves and they arm the settlers everybody else but
[36:37.560 --> 36:45.040]  then the ADL lobbies to take guns of American people so I think what's good
[36:45.040 --> 36:51.320]  for Israel or Switzerland is good for us Switzerland has the lowest crime rate
[36:51.320 --> 36:57.840]  in the world and every military age person has to own a gun and then after
[36:57.840 --> 37:02.320]  that there's tax incentives to own guns and when you're part of the militia they
[37:02.320 --> 37:05.760]  do home inspections to make sure your guns are hidden in case a foreign enemy
[37:05.760 --> 37:10.280]  ever took over and they have weapons caches in redoubts all over the hills
[37:10.280 --> 37:15.240]  and mountains where citizens can get in to caches of full-auto grenade launchers
[37:15.240 --> 37:19.480]  you name it and by the way Switzerland has one of the smallest
[37:19.480 --> 37:29.200]  militaries in the world and for 500 years no one will invade them 450
[37:29.200 --> 37:33.960]  something years the story of William Tell is true we'll do a report on William
[37:33.960 --> 37:40.200]  Tell the shot the apple off with the crossbow they really made him do that and
[37:40.200 --> 37:44.280]  then he got mad went and killed a bunch of the police who were Austrian
[37:44.280 --> 37:51.360]  Hungarian Empire basically had taken over Switzerland and he started an
[37:51.360 --> 37:56.040]  uprising that overthrew them that's why Switzerland became the model of us in
[37:56.040 --> 38:02.680]  1776 Switzerland itself was imitating the free areas of the Netherlands
[38:02.680 --> 38:07.520]  previously where the private business owners had to guard their own businesses
[38:07.520 --> 38:12.160]  at their ports from pirates and so if you had a little port you would have
[38:12.160 --> 38:15.760]  your own garrison your own cannons your own weapons so the Netherlands and
[38:15.760 --> 38:22.160]  Switzerland is where we get this from and if you study William Tell then you
[38:22.160 --> 38:26.840]  know the rest of the story and so that's why they have the lowest crime rate in
[38:26.840 --> 38:32.320]  the world and they're armed to the teeth with armored redoubts big steel doors
[38:32.320 --> 38:36.200]  they have keys to they can trust their citizens and they can open it up and
[38:36.200 --> 38:41.360]  there's food and weapons and huge caches and guess what nobody ever robs them
[38:41.360 --> 38:46.360]  hey Alex I've actually been to Switzerland and I've seen the armored
[38:46.360 --> 38:50.840]  redoubts I've seen the tank blockades as you drive through these little villages
[38:50.840 --> 38:53.960]  for folks that don't know the people have the tanks in fact do you live there
[38:53.960 --> 38:58.760]  what for six months six months back in the 90s and working on a ski resort tell
[38:58.760 --> 39:02.680]  folks about I'm glad you brought this up well it is interesting and I thought it was they
[39:02.680 --> 39:07.080]  had these tank blockade driving this is Rob do the news director speaking more
[39:07.080 --> 39:10.200]  and more we're gonna just have the crew chime in when they've got interesting
[39:10.200 --> 39:14.000]  points I've told them to do that so do spend a few minutes talking about
[39:14.000 --> 39:19.560]  Switzerland sure I went to Switzerland back in the early 90s and what I thought
[39:19.560 --> 39:24.080]  was amazing was was one when we stayed on the ski resort we go down into town and
[39:24.080 --> 39:28.880]  we had a place to stay in there and it was a bomb shelter huge probably two-foot
[39:28.880 --> 39:33.760]  thick steel door you go inside there it had cots and stuff but then they had
[39:33.760 --> 39:39.680]  storage units for people every one of them had a machine gun a machine gun a
[39:39.680 --> 39:44.880]  helmet these guys they were ready and I thought back at the time I was probably
[39:44.880 --> 39:49.720]  a little more liberal than I am now and and definitely not as pro gun and I was
[39:49.720 --> 39:52.880]  like oh why are they allowed to have all these guns and I asked one of the the
[39:52.880 --> 39:56.360]  bartenders there and they said we're armed we're armed that's why nobody
[39:56.360 --> 40:00.160]  invades us and then as you're going through the countryside you see these
[40:00.160 --> 40:03.960]  concrete barriers that they had left over from World War two they just keep
[40:03.960 --> 40:08.680]  them they're set up and you're not gonna get any any heavy armor you're not gonna
[40:08.680 --> 40:12.280]  get any tanks into Switzerland you're not gonna get very far definitely and
[40:12.280 --> 40:17.840]  you're gonna be shot at by by people and there's also they had trees their
[40:17.840 --> 40:21.960]  missile silos are disguised as giant trees up in the mountains the Swiss are
[40:21.960 --> 40:25.160]  ready for anything and that's why nobody invades them and that's why they're
[40:25.160 --> 40:28.480]  able to remain neutral and that's why they have and it's because 400 plus years
[40:28.480 --> 40:33.400]  ago they got taken over and they kicked the enemy out after a 60-something years
[40:33.400 --> 40:38.400]  of occupation and 400 plus years later they're the richest safest country in
[40:38.400 --> 40:43.280]  the world and they've built new tank redoubts all over the country as well and
[40:43.280 --> 40:47.360]  they are ready and that's why nobody dared invade we got them up right now
[40:47.360 --> 40:51.840]  that's exactly what it looked like and it was amazing everywhere and a lot of
[40:51.840 --> 40:54.840]  people that lived in the cities had little shacks that they would go to on
[40:54.840 --> 40:59.600]  the weekends and have gardens the Swiss are definitely they know what it's about
[40:59.600 --> 41:03.120]  there they know about nature they know about the Second Amendment and they
[41:03.120 --> 41:07.360]  know about freedom and unfortunately they live in socialist Europe so they
[41:07.360 --> 41:10.720]  they have some of those programs there but it's a very clean place and they're
[41:10.720 --> 41:13.240]  trying to get rid of it they're trying to get rid of the cantons the reason
[41:13.240 --> 41:16.920]  they're successful again we're partially based on this also the Eric the
[41:16.920 --> 41:22.240]  Iroquois nation gave a lot to the Constitution Bill of Rights Jefferson
[41:22.240 --> 41:26.640]  talked about that the Swiss system as well they have their cantons that are
[41:26.640 --> 41:31.000]  their states that then go and meet the leaders the cantons meet and are the
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.000]  federal government just like we in the past would send us senators were
[41:35.000 --> 41:38.440]  elected by the legislature they were creatures of the state they could be
[41:38.440 --> 41:42.520]  recalled and the states around the country well in 1913 at the same time
[41:42.520 --> 41:46.320]  they gave us the private Federal Reserve and the collection agency the IRS they
[41:46.320 --> 41:51.160]  got rid of that and made senators be popularly elected making them then their
[41:51.160 --> 41:56.280]  own little kings and so we need to go back to our Swiss roots and our Iroquois
[41:56.280 --> 42:00.600]  roots because the Iroquois a confederation others were some of the
[42:00.600 --> 42:04.080]  most successful natives and didn't have as much warring because they would have
[42:04.080 --> 42:09.160]  all their sub tribes you know elect leaders who would then go vote so again
[42:09.160 --> 42:14.400]  that's what we come from Native American and Swiss and Dutch systems fused
[42:14.400 --> 42:19.680]  together not Greek democracy we do not come from Greek democracy that is a
[42:19.680 --> 42:24.720]  lie Greek democracy was a bucket for black stones and a bucket for white
[42:24.720 --> 42:29.960]  stones was only in a few other states and if they didn't like what you said
[42:29.960 --> 42:34.240]  the elite got to vote not the not the average man not the average woman in
[42:34.240 --> 42:39.960]  fact most men were slaves no Greeks were slaves slavery was just across the
[42:39.960 --> 42:43.880]  board and but but the higher up elite would get to go vote and they didn't
[42:43.880 --> 42:48.920]  like what you said they'd go vote and they would black stones would be a no
[42:48.920 --> 42:52.160]  vote white stones a yes vote and if there were more black stones than white
[42:52.160 --> 42:55.560]  stones on a vote to kill you then they wouldn't kill you but if there were more
[42:55.560 --> 42:59.640]  white stones they would kill you then they'd vote on how to kill you that's a
[42:59.640 --> 43:05.680]  democracy where a 51% votes to say make black people slaves again black people
[43:05.680 --> 43:12.320]  are slaves again if in a democracy if they vote to take from people that have
[43:12.320 --> 43:15.880]  good health records and have been paying their insurance and double your prices
[43:15.880 --> 43:22.200]  to then pay off insurance companies it happens but in a republic I don't care
[43:22.200 --> 43:26.600]  of 90% of people vote to make black people slaves and and put them in a
[43:26.600 --> 43:31.480]  field and put a rope around their neck and make them pull plows the black
[43:31.480 --> 43:34.840]  folks or the white folks or anybody else is being oppressed have a right to say
[43:34.840 --> 43:39.120]  no and fight to defend themselves because in a republic you can't vote to
[43:39.120 --> 43:43.520]  take somebody's private property or make them live like you want them to or
[43:43.520 --> 43:48.480]  follow your God or not follow your God this is what America is and they will
[43:48.480 --> 43:52.960]  not tell us they lie and they tell us it comes from the Greeks and I'm not
[43:52.960 --> 43:56.400]  bashing the Greeks some of the philosophy culture and architecture does
[43:56.400 --> 44:01.680]  and it contributed to the Renaissance overall but our system is Swiss and
[44:01.680 --> 44:09.400]  Iroquois it is not Greek and it's a giant lie that we are a grecian democracy we
[44:09.400 --> 44:15.160]  are not a grecian democracy and again Greece at one time had more than 20
[44:15.160 --> 44:19.520]  kingdoms depending on which period of the Greeks so you could find any system
[44:19.520 --> 44:23.360]  you wanted in the Greek system and I've kind of gone off on a rant here do it's
[44:23.360 --> 44:27.000]  just that the average American does not know where we came from well Jefferson
[44:27.000 --> 44:31.760]  told us the Swiss and the Iroquois is where he came up with the Constitution
[44:31.760 --> 44:39.240]  along with Magna Carta so it's a fusion of English common law Iroquois and Swiss
[44:39.240 --> 44:42.520]  ideas and we just need to know what our American roots are but isn't it
[44:42.520 --> 44:46.640]  interesting that they don't want Hispanics to feel included in Texas even
[44:46.640 --> 44:51.560]  though the Constitution was written by the Hispanic founder more than 35% of
[44:51.560 --> 44:55.200]  people that voted in the first legislature were Hispanic they want
[44:55.200 --> 44:58.120]  to exclude Hispanics from being part of Texas culture when they're at the very
[44:58.120 --> 45:01.600]  heart of it and they want to exclude Native Americans out of the
[45:01.600 --> 45:06.400]  Constitution and that they were the main model even above the Swiss isn't that
[45:06.400 --> 45:09.880]  interesting dude it's very interesting and when that was one of the things
[45:09.880 --> 45:13.200]  Russell Means talked about when we went to visit him he's like did you know that
[45:13.200 --> 45:18.840]  did you know that your Constitution is based off Iroquois law and it's amazing
[45:18.840 --> 45:23.680]  that they don't teach kids that they teach kids and you hear everybody say
[45:23.680 --> 45:26.920]  that we're a democracy we're a democracy we're a constitutional
[45:26.920 --> 45:32.120]  republic and people don't realize that because it's not taught to kids and it's
[45:32.120 --> 45:35.600]  it's sad and there's a there's a New York Times article bringing up Iroquois
[45:35.600 --> 45:41.440]  Constitution a forerunner to colonists democratic principles but they lie and
[45:41.440 --> 45:46.400]  call it democratic principles no it's a yes it's a limited democracy and that
[45:46.400 --> 45:49.640]  you can do whatever you want as long as you don't hurt somebody else but the
[45:49.640 --> 45:54.280]  majority cannot vote to take the rights of a minority and the minority rights and
[45:54.280 --> 45:58.600]  the majority rights are all codified and those are the rules of the game you
[45:58.600 --> 46:03.840]  cannot violate them and the minute you violate them you're now in a mob rule
[46:03.840 --> 46:11.160]  tyranny and that's what we have where special interest the IRS the White House
[46:11.160 --> 46:16.960]  can engage in any crime they want and they're above the law but the IRS can
[46:16.960 --> 46:21.920]  tell some old lady who's 85 years old oh 10 years ago we think you underpaid a
[46:21.920 --> 46:28.040]  thousand dollars and so you know with interest it's now 50,000 and then they
[46:28.040 --> 46:31.960]  drain the old woman's bank account make her sell her house throw around the
[46:31.960 --> 46:38.080]  street and we stand for this as a society we put up with this garbage this is
[46:38.080 --> 46:43.760]  pure bull the IRS has written the rules on record to screw everyone over where
[46:43.760 --> 46:48.160]  it's impossible and now the New York Times reports that law lets IRS sees
[46:48.160 --> 46:52.560]  accounts on suspicion no crime no charges of people with no criminal
[46:52.560 --> 46:59.000]  records because they deposit cash ever you ever deposit under a thousand
[46:59.000 --> 47:01.340]  dollars well she didn't make a thousand dollars a day with her small
[47:01.340 --> 47:08.280]  restaurant she had for 40 years they took her life savings $33,000 that she
[47:08.280 --> 47:14.640]  had receipts on they don't care this is tyranny this is evil this is what was
[47:14.640 --> 47:20.960]  happening in William Tell's time in Switzerland in fact do remind me I'm
[47:20.960 --> 47:25.640]  gonna do a special report on William Tell it's riveting stuff yeah and again
[47:25.640 --> 47:29.760]  where's the movie about William Tell where's the movie about the Iroquois
[47:29.760 --> 47:34.400]  nation where's the movie about Magna Carta where's the movie about George
[47:34.400 --> 47:38.960]  Washington where is it all so epic when you read the real history books that you
[47:38.960 --> 47:46.800]  cannot believe it it's so epic America part of our job is to retell the history
[47:46.800 --> 47:51.400]  that they're trying to hide and that they don't teach kids anymore it's
[47:51.400 --> 47:56.040]  literally there's a dark period in when America was first being formed that they
[47:56.040 --> 47:59.840]  don't teach kids and of course America had a lot of problems and a lot of
[47:59.840 --> 48:03.440]  swashbuckling a lot of battles and evil and six different empires trying to take
[48:03.440 --> 48:06.560]  over this open area and all the different native tribes getting different
[48:06.560 --> 48:09.360]  groups that want to double cross each other people are people we all act the
[48:09.360 --> 48:13.040]  same when there's always gonna be evil that's our job to stand up to it and
[48:13.040 --> 48:17.160]  point out when it's wrong absolutely afraid to do it absolutely so I've
[48:17.160 --> 48:24.320]  covered about ten articles so far just look at this how about the Jewish group
[48:24.320 --> 48:31.760]  comes out and says let's arm everybody in France I mean what's gonna happen if
[48:31.760 --> 48:35.720]  France says okay if you're Jewish you can have a guy but nobody else can isn't
[48:35.720 --> 48:38.880]  that discrimination but see under political correctness if you're a
[48:38.880 --> 48:47.280]  protected minority you get rights that other people don't but I think it's a
[48:47.280 --> 48:51.280]  great idea and I agree with the head of Interpol saying it's time to arm people
[48:51.280 --> 48:56.080]  that will put it into this very very quick now let's continue here for top
[48:56.080 --> 49:02.920]  secret service executives told to leave their post in agency shakeup this is a
[49:02.920 --> 49:06.320]  persecution ladies and gentlemen that let me give you a little news flash
[49:06.320 --> 49:09.280]  there have been members of the secret service that have always been visiting
[49:09.280 --> 49:15.560]  hookers I don't care what doctors lawyers auto mechanics there's a
[49:15.560 --> 49:19.760]  percentage of every profession that sees hookers I mean that's been going on
[49:19.760 --> 49:25.120]  since before civilization okay they use that as this big deal to now persecute a
[49:25.120 --> 49:29.080]  bunch of people in the agency who again if they were going after them for real
[49:29.080 --> 49:32.920]  corruption like the CIA blackmailing Congress and hacking their computers
[49:32.920 --> 49:37.800]  they've now investigated themselves and says it's fine then I'd say yeah go up a
[49:37.800 --> 49:41.560]  secret service this is the same White House persecuting the military
[49:41.560 --> 49:48.680]  persecuting Petraeus right now over a girlfriend oh let's indict him over a
[49:48.680 --> 49:56.960]  girlfriend this is the same Justice Department that is openly running fast
[49:56.960 --> 50:01.080]  and furious covering up Benghazi covering up all these big banks and

[56:58.680 --> 57:03.440]  now we've got Dr. Group who's here he's come up from South Texas huge
[57:03.440 --> 57:07.440]  investigative report it's hiding in plain view the flu shot is killing people
[57:07.440 --> 57:11.520]  and causing mystery illnesses he's going to give the medical science behind it
[57:11.520 --> 57:17.400]  that's all coming up and a lot more with Dr. Group US Lucen's embargo on Cuba
[57:17.400 --> 57:22.840]  making trade and travel easier I don't like communism I don't like Fidel
[57:22.840 --> 57:29.880]  Castro the conservative Cuban community is one of the most pro-liberty groups out
[57:29.880 --> 57:36.880]  there that said I do want to open Cuba up because opening it up to trade and
[57:36.880 --> 57:40.960]  opening it up now after 60 plus years or almost 60 years whatever it is since
[57:40.960 --> 57:45.640]  embargo has been in there since like 61 so let me do your math as it is over 60
[57:45.640 --> 57:49.640]  years since all of this has been going on Obama has now eased them but it's
[57:49.640 --> 57:54.600]  selective and I warned of this this is the crony capitalist model it's why they
[57:54.600 --> 57:58.480]  like to partner with dictatorships where they will now allow select
[57:58.480 --> 58:03.760]  corporations and groups in and will still then selectively prosecute people
[58:03.760 --> 58:07.040]  so it's not safe to go to Cuba under this we knew this was coming this is the
[58:07.040 --> 58:12.280]  model they will allow selective groups selective corporations to operate and
[58:12.280 --> 58:18.760]  not generally you either totally open it up or you don't open it up at all
[58:18.760 --> 58:23.120]  that's my view opening it up would cause the communist dictatorship to fall
[58:23.120 --> 58:26.440]  over time I don't think it would still be there they wouldn't have done this
[58:26.440 --> 58:31.320]  but it's just another bad move I mean it's like Obama offering free tuition
[58:31.320 --> 58:34.800]  turns out it massively increases the prices it's like Obamacare was supposed
[58:34.800 --> 58:39.920]  to be free it's all screw jobs on top of screw jobs stay with us

[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:45.800]  flu causing misery illnesses causing deaths we got a stack of news on that
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:51.160]  front as well again I was getting into this earlier in the last hour it makes
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:57.600]  me so angry that the IRS is targeting tens of thousands of nonprofit
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:04.560]  Christian pro-life and constitutional organizations and criminally going after
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:08.240]  them with no evidence and admitting its political persecution and the IRS says
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:15.040]  they will now continue all of that selectively they issued every charity
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:19.640]  release to any liberal group that requested them last year and denied
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:25.520]  almost every new application for conservative nonprofits this is
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:32.160]  unprecedented and now George Soros Washington Times it is analysis of it
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:39.600]  and again we just blew up the video that showed on the signs who was backing it
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:45.520]  they were all Soros groups well now it turns out that the money from Soros is
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:51.200]  going directly in to stir up these anti-police demonstrations trying to
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:56.600]  scapegoat the police as the end-all be-all problem in America and in the
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:01.920]  world certainly there's problems with police certainly they become militarized
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:06.320]  but that's the globalist that's the feds I mean Soros worked with militarized
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:10.160]  police in Nazi Germany and was one of their top minions and was very well
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:14.640]  rewarded and made his first millions off of that so I just want to point out
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:25.960]  who's behind this now that said when you look at the Albuquerque situation last
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:29.280]  Friday and in fact you guys print me that article I forgot to cover that in
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:37.120]  detail they indicted the two officers that shot the unarmed homeless man to
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.720]  death and why did they indict them the grand jury indicted them because one of
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:43.960]  the cops driving up says I can't wait to blow this guy's testicles off and kill
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:49.840]  him and the other guy was celebrating and then they fire on him and go boo ya
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:55.240]  and are all excited and have the dog bite him when he's dead it's clearly cold
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:01.600]  blooded murder by mentally ill killers in my view so they now have been charged
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:10.160]  with murder and again that is the story DA's office bypasses grand jury I guess
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:16.080]  because they wouldn't take action the Albuquerque department continues to kill
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:20.120]  unarmed innocent people and has been arrogant about it and it's causing a
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:25.400]  total collapse and confidence in the system do you see George Soros out
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:30.000]  there stirring up trouble no because it's a Democrat controlled area this is
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  purely partisanship just like the Democratic Party and Soros funded
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.440]  Occupy Wall Street Occupy Wall Street had some good points a lot of the
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.520]  corruption comes from Wall Street but it's not free market it's crony insider
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:46.320]  fraud it's gangsterism but after a year of that when they couldn't organize it
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:51.520]  into a Democratic Party group you know they financed it Obama in 36 cities had
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:55.880]  SWAT teams federal SWAT teams raid them and arrest them and including snipers
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:01.640]  prepared to kill the peaceful leaders that came out in the news last year so
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:07.160]  see they're just trying to get some big infighting movement going to distract us
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:14.320]  from black unemployment doubling under Obama are there legitimate cases to be
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:18.520]  investigated the police killing innocent black men absolutely do cops
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:23.480]  sometimes get off because they're cops absolutely do they brutally murder
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:30.240]  people sometimes absolutely do they get off sometimes absolutely but does that
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:35.640]  mean when George Soros tries to stir up a race war it's good no because a race
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:40.160]  war is not gonna help anybody and I know I've harped on that at nauseam it's
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:47.920]  just that here it is the Washington Times 33 million this last year to stir
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:54.000]  up these groups 33 million just to stir up the race war stuff I mean he runs MSNBC
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.320]  it's the race war channel 33 million
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:03.640]  when cells become toxic they die early and aging sets in no one has put together

[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:36.320]  I am your host Alex Jones we have breaking news out of Belgium live
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:40.040]  reports of three dead and anti-terror raid in Belgium Belgium public
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:45.160]  television channel RTBF is reporting that three people have been killed during
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:52.360]  a police counterterrorism raid in Ververas in the east of the country the
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:56.680]  belga news agency quoted federal prosecutors saying there had been a police
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:01.560]  operation or the center of the town but did not confirm there had been casualties
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:09.080]  I wonder if it'll turn out that their patsies trained by ISIS in one of those
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:14.200]  third world Middle Eastern countries that have been turned over to their
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:19.000]  control by the West and $10 billion being given to them regardless it'll be
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:25.280]  used to try to take more people's basic freedoms casualties in Belgium police
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:30.480]  anti-terror raid that's a long telegraph headline three dead so we'll
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:37.960]  continue to watch that as it unfolds I want to welcome Dr. Edward group in
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:41.800]  studio with us for the rest of the hour we'll be interspersing news throughout
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:47.320]  the broadcast again I think it's big news that it's now been documented in a
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:51.920]  Washington Times report that George Soros has spent $33 million last year
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:58.320]  financing race war groups anti-police groups in an attempt to stir up civil
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:04.880]  unrest in America so the feds and Obama can save us he of course learned back
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:08.760]  when he was 15 as a Nazi collaborator helping ferret out and find Jews and
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:14.320]  robbing them that having a destabilized country is a great way to make money for
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:19.520]  people that have ate an abetted mass murderers like George Soros so again I
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:22.520]  told you he was behind it we didn't research on the groups that were out
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:26.680]  there now it's in the Washington Times today the CIA has put out a report
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:30.840]  saying that's perfectly fine for them to spy on Congress and blackmail Congress
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:34.880]  basically they say no wrongdoing an agency search of computers it's just a
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:39.120]  search of the computer it's not violating you when your smart television
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:42.480]  records everything you do and quote sends it to third parties as Samsung
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:45.280]  Microsoft and others admit they're doing it's okay I mean they're just
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:48.760]  recording you and giving it to somebody I mean be kind of like if your
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:52.320]  neighbor got a dinner at nine at night and saw you look through the window at
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:55.760]  them your neighbor might come out and punch you in the nose but nowadays you
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:00.840]  just go hey I mean your TV watches you what's the big deal 1984 is an instruction
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:06.520]  manual didn't you get the memo now the reason we've got Dr. Group here is so
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:10.600]  important in the last few months it's emerged that thousands have been dying
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:16.080]  from mystery illnesses super pneumonia they're calling it Legionnaires disease
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:21.840]  on steroids even New York Daily News has been talking about that there is so
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:27.520]  many new bizarre things emerging and I know that when there's a real pandemic
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:32.000]  as happened in 2014 when I lost three family members to basically super
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.080]  pneumonia in Texas that the media wouldn't cover it well this year it's so
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:44.000]  bad so far in the winter in 2014 2015 that we're now 15 days into that they're
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.160]  starting to report on how serious it is and Rob do was the one that pointed out
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:52.920]  a few weeks ago so we called Dr. Group because he been reporting on it as well
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:58.440]  that we're seeing children all over the country hundreds of them that we know
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:02.640]  about I've got over 30 articles here just in the stack today where the little
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:07.560]  kids take the flu shot and then die a week later of the flu now they're on
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:11.040]  the news saying oh you better get another shot or you better take camera
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:15.000]  flu because this year's mutation we didn't guess it right it doesn't help
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.280]  you they've never guessed correctly the bigger the hoax as Joseph Gerbils and
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:27.000]  Hitler said the more they'll believe it the bigger the lie the flu shot on record
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.560]  just just search engine taking flu shot doubles your chances of getting flu
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:36.880]  lowers immune system there's a reason flu is worse and they have this fake
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:41.240]  number of 34,000 a year that die from it that's 34,000 people that die of
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:46.440]  malnutrition they have cancer diabetes amputees they've had surgeries you name
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:50.160]  it it's well known that they then attribute to flu so yes if you're
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:55.320]  really sick as you've had 15 flu shots over the years then you take another
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:13:00.640]  flu shot they have all these movies coming out about well you're gonna get
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:04.040]  Alzheimer's when you're 20 now all these neurological disorders are just
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:09.040]  going straight up I saw studies 20 years ago when I first got on air I saw
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:13.480]  study six seven years ago again it comes out all the time flu shots connected
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:18.200]  to Alzheimer's neurological disorders they cause autoimmune responses in the
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:22.480]  body that are much worse than if you have an allergy to a bee sting which
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:27.920]  can also make you swell up and die it's simple a lot of people are allergic to
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:33.080]  use a layman term to vaccines that's only one level though and the insert say
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:40.000]  it confirm flu vaccine increases risk of serious pandemic that was the H1N1
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.920]  and that was directly out of the Canadian government and others now
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:48.960]  joining us for the balance of the hour is Dr. Edward group of the global healing
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:52.440]  center he's also helped us pioneer some of the groundbreaking products at
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:57.560]  infowarslife.com we're gonna talk about the latest on this go through all this
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:00.840]  with him and then talk about some of the ways that we can bolster immune systems
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:06.360]  naturally against the new super viruses and things that are coming out of the
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:12.560]  vaccines and again much of the vaccine manufacturing is corrupted with the RNA
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:17.520]  and DNA of the animal cultures the egg cultures the fetal cultures it's raised
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:23.760]  in just like Pepsi test their flavoring with fetal cells I mean ladies and
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:27.360]  gentlemen we're not in Kansas anymore Dr. group thank you for coming up
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:32.280]  from South Texas from your clinic to break all this down with us flu
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:35.920]  pneumonia worst ever this year's flu is going to be the worst ever spiking
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:39.760]  pneumonia and flu cases but they admit vaccination for flu with their big push
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:43.280]  is the highest ever we'd backed it off you know six seven years ago they've
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:48.320]  doubled down mystery illness what is the mystery illness everybody's getting
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:53.160]  government pushes vaccines with mega mercury sterility drugs governments new
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:56.560]  drugs for the year are full of sterilization and death-causing materials
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:03.040]  and the Tama flu scam Dr. group thanks for joining us break it down well first
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:06.760]  of all it's impossible to develop a flu shot because the influenza virus
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:10.920]  replicates so often and that's not debated not debated not debated there's
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:16.320]  over 300 documented influenza viruses so basically what they do is they just
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:20.800]  choose each individual one that they want to include in the vaccines the
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:24.080]  scary thing is women are getting flu shots when they're pregnant so what
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:28.240]  they're trying to do is introduce these compounds like what you're talking about
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:32.880]  RNA DNA and I'm going to go over a few of those too as well but if you look at
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:38.680]  the 13 flu vaccines or flu shots that were approved this year if you can zoom
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:42.560]  in on this one of the ones that I'm the most concerned about is the flu level
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:49.680]  and that has 25,000 times the amount of mercury allowable by the EPA in it and
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:54.120]  it's got 51 parts per million and what they're doing with these flu shots now
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:59.760]  is they're doing trivalent and quadrivalent strains in here so let's
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:03.120]  say you were to mix two strains together you don't know what's gonna happen with
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:08.160]  that then they loaned three strains let's say influenza A influenza B H1N1
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:16.000]  subtype H3N2 subtype swine flu and the interesting thing is I've broken this
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.600]  down to show people how the pharmaceutical companies make money on
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:23.760]  all these things and how they put out the propaganda and why this is all done
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:29.960]  on purpose when you start creating and injecting children as you can see these
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:34.840]  vaccines most of them are approved for three years and up when you start
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.920]  injecting all these things in the body what you have to worry about is not only
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:43.640]  the individual viral strains but what else is included in those vaccines and
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:50.000]  courtesy of the CDC and the FDA.gov site I've have a list of some of the most
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:57.120]  toxic things that are in here you have most most of these ingredients can
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:02.160]  cause sterility in males and also mess with the reproductive system in females
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:06.480]  they're also endocrine disrupting chemicals in there there's antibiotics in
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:10.920]  here that's why people are developing resistance to some of the bacterial bugs
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:18.440]  as well mercury Triton X polysorbate 20 the fluva lax vaccine this year has
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:24.400]  made in Darby canine kidney cell proteins in it I don't know where they're
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:27.840]  getting the dogs from to get the kidney cells from the dogs and the culturing
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:31.560]  and let's be clear that's same thing with monkeys that gave over a hundred a
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:37.480]  million Americans cancer according to the CDC declassification in 1987 through
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:42.520]  that 40-year vaccination program they knew and Dr. Sox on video admitting that
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:48.040]  it all had SV 40 that would end up giving almost everyone cancer it embeds in
[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:52.960]  your DNA the RNA and then starts causing mutations that's why we have all
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:58.480]  these rare cancers that are so popular now this is over the top insane it is
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:02.640]  over the top insane because what are they going to be doing next year they're
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:06.840]  going to have 20 influenza substrains the next year they're going to have 25 I
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:09.680]  mean when are they going to put 300 substrains in there I mean it's all
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:12.680]  designed to weaken the immune system they're training everyone soon everyone's
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:16.160]  gonna have Alzheimer's should everyone have cancer but no one says oh the
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:20.120]  vaccine says it does that this is an extermination what the reason why they
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:23.480]  have Alzheimer's at 20 is because they get a flu shot every year and if you
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:29.000]  combine let's say one CC three CC's of these flu shots and you give it to
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.680]  somebody well they know now that these flu shots can cross the placenta to as
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:37.320]  well and get into the baby so let's say you give someone for 20 years a flu
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:41.120]  shot not only do they have mercury but they also have aluminum and you know
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:45.120]  what happens when you put mercury and aluminum together for the for the
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:48.800]  neurofibers in the brain it completely fries and melts away the neurons in the
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:53.000]  brain super charges it it super charges it and that's why you're seeing because
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.320]  the aluminum is an adjuvant and then accelerates the power of the mercury the
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:19:03.640]  yes it does it it highly by a thousand times accelerates the D but that's good
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:07.560]  to have your you know your son playing football at 17 and 25 is dead I mean
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:11.080]  this is kind of a because you can be in a march or a run and raise some money for
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:14.240]  the very companies doing well it creates mental illness to yeah yeah but
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:18.280]  exactly but but I mean never never never try to find out why all this is
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:21.880]  exploding off the chart just let the companies doing it grandstand and then
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:26.440]  raise money off charity to quote find a cure for what they did on purpose well
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:29.120]  that's the way it works it's a corporation I mean that they're in it
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:33.120]  for money and in the depopulation and they want everybody sick and they want
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:36.720]  everybody dependent upon the government and that's what links it to the Tama
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:40.400]  flu and some of the other and stay there I want to go through the mystery
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:44.320]  illness and the evidence you've got that it's actually causing it the flu shots
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:50.320]  what's happening in the body and then I want to talk about the incredible push
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:54.480]  I mean I have been bullied in elevators and in grocery stores get your flu shot
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:59.640]  by nurses and citizens there's a cult now really pushing us stay there millions
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:03.400]  of people are going to get sick this winter from colds flues and other
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:08.120]  illnesses make sure you're not one of them protect yourself with supernatural
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:13.320]  silver a revolutionary new product recent advances in silver technology have

[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:36.200]  is just break the crew in because they like to be on air we're just live in
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:39.920]  prompt to we're gonna bring everybody back there more and more into the show
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:43.640]  Dr. group by the way I will be talking to Leanne and Joe and others about what
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:46.480]  they think about the flu vaccine and what's happening coming up a little
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:51.720]  bit in the next segment but first new breaking news on Belgium Belgium arrest
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:57.760]  a police probe Europe wide terror links they believe that the folks that they've
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:00.920]  just engaged in and looks like a gun battle there's things some may be dead
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:06.040]  may have been connected to giving ammunition or arms to the brothers and
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:11.120]  others so we will continue to break that down there's a Bulgarian warrant
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:15.880]  Spanish investigation looking for terrorists I hope they can roll up these
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:21.120]  ISIS groups the problem is they came out of the west you're a special operations
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:24.840]  veteran yourself Dr. group you've seen a lot of this around the world classified
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:29.040]  stuff you can't talk about watching our government fund ISIS NATO fund ISIS
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:33.480]  France kind of led this whole Syrian free army thing now they're attacking
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:37.920]  France before we shift gears back into flu what is your gut just watching it
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:42.000]  tell you that they're trying to establish a police state I mean it's all
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:49.520]  about fear so they can train and militarize our individual county and city
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:52.320]  police departments which they're already doing I mean they're created
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:57.760]  Homeland Security they have the TSA they all of the military they're setting up
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:02.720]  checkpoints all over the United States the special operations military groups
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:07.440]  that they're forming that are trained in civilian warfare the FEMA camps I mean
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:11.040]  if you put every single thing together it's really doesn't look good it doesn't
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:15.400]  look good it's all fear-based to create the fear and then the government to
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:20.060]  protect you and then George Soros spent 33 mil last year let's just say it
[01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:25.400]  trying to stir blacks up all of it's done by design a Nazi collaborator trying
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:29.640]  to cause a race war I mean can you make that up truth is stranger than fiction
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:35.040]  what is he doing walking around it gets deeper and deeper and deeper is one of
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:38.280]  the things because there's so many people this year and I do believe that
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:42.640]  this year's flu is one of the worst on record now let's get into how big I mean
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:45.720]  this is an emergency public service announcement you're getting into
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:48.560]  sum it up and we'll get into the data I mean you have it all there from the CDC
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:53.480]  worst on record when we have record flu shots right so more flu shots worse flu
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:58.320]  if you look at this document right here you'll see that every single region and
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:02.120]  from the CDC site is elevated elevated elevated elevated read that for
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:06.360]  radio listeners okay so region number one is elevated all the way region one
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:09.880]  to ten which are all the regions nationally in the United States are
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:14.480]  elevated that's the level that they're at right now from the CDC there's a few
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:18.560]  different types of strains that are out there in the flu shots or it correlates
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:21.960]  to what's in the flu shot exactly exactly if there's people are getting the
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:26.460]  exact strains that are in the shot exactly the a influenza a h1n1 which was
[01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:29.640]  bird flu that came out in 2009 there's an interesting story that I'm going to
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:33.840]  get into with that considering the fact that Tama flu is about to expire and the
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:37.320]  five-year expiration date and they're trying to push out all the billions in
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:43.160]  dose of doses of Tama flu they have left over but then you have the a h3 which
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:48.680]  is a swine flu derivative and you have the sub a sub typing and another B
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:54.200]  influenza so this is what's reported by the CDC and as we know that usually the
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:28:01.120]  flu season is going to last all the way through February so my main research has
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:03.820]  been because my phones are ringing off the hook and people are saying what
[01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:07.000]  can we do about this of course I tell them don't get the flu shot their
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:13.080]  doctors are recommending CBS News said that mercury's good for my brain CBS News
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:16.720]  says a lot of things okay through you're saying they're lying well I believe
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:20.280]  them I mean even though it's deadly poison I believe well you have 26 deaths
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:23.960]  already child deaths this year because of the flu I think it's way more no it's
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:27.480]  that's what's been reported and you have so many people missing work and you have
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:31.120]  so many kids missing school and that's how it's spreading because they're using
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:34.520]  live viruses to spread this around the weakened people's weakened people's
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:38.800]  immune system and the thing is they're coming back and saying okay these are
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:44.120]  the approved medications that we're allowing for this year's flu Tama
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:49.120]  flu is the big one I don't know if anyone else noticed but since October pretty
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:54.280]  much the Tama flu commercials have been running non-stop on all major TV
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:29:00.320]  channels so why is it that we put an H1N1 virus in the in the flu shots this
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:04.840]  year and then come on the back end and then try to sell and prescribe Tama
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:10.480]  flu and for those who don't know Wolfgang Wardard the head of the EU medical
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:14.240]  Commission later was able to confirm and came on our broadcast during the H1N1
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:18.160]  outbreak that it had been put in vaccines a year before as a quote
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:23.280]  simulant to see how flu spread it was a secret medical test but it was a real
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:28.320]  flu virus so then it showed up bigger the next year because it had spread into
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:33.360]  Mexico in the off flu season so they staged that whole deal and it's just a
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:37.720]  minor blurb of the news oh they staged it big deal well the whole flu shot is
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:40.720]  it's a business and it's just like prescription medications this is
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:45.320]  something they can sell to 300 million people every single year and children
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:48.240]  explain how it's connected to the mystery illnesses when we come back stay

[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:15.280]  guess over a month ago the point is I didn't just say that earlier that's
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:21.680]  admitted they do this every year and then I'll be at the health club in the
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:29.680]  steam room and some old guy was like yeah I've been sick I got the flu you
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:35.400]  better get your flu shot these people not getting it give it to everybody and I
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:39.480]  went to the old guys like a week ago I joined a health club and I looked at him
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:45.240]  and I said you know who I am don't you he goes yeah I know who you are and I was
[01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:50.160]  just like well wait a minute so you get the flu shot every year I do and I'm
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:54.800]  sitting there and I go well but you got the flu and now you're kind of bitching
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:58.680]  at me as if I gave it to you because that's the line you people that don't
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:03.000]  get vaccinated that's in the news you're causing everyone why you didn't get
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:07.320]  vaccinated so I got shingles you didn't get vaccinated so I got the flu you
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:10.200]  didn't get vaccinated so I got hepatitis when I got a blood transfusion or
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:17.880]  whatever hypothetical if you've gotten it it protects you then me not getting it
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:24.120]  should not affect you dumb dumb and then I was at a business deal and I got on
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:29.040]  the elevator and there was this mobile nurse with these two guys with her and
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:32.280]  I said oh interesting you're a mobile nurse she looks me she goes it's about a
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:38.160]  month ago get your flu shot and I went excuse me and she goes you heard me
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:41.040]  everybody needs to get it it's an imperative and then I've been in a
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:47.640]  Walgreens and heard them barking it and just I was in the gym the same gym but
[01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:51.520]  not in the steam room and this guy walks behind me when I'm on the elliptical and
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:55.280]  goes everybody needs to get their flu shots now he obviously knew who I was so
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:36:00.080]  people know who I am so they're barking at me but I've talked to other people who
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:05.960]  aren't public figures they're being barked at so we went to record lows
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:10.200]  getting flu vaccine actually during the whole H1N1 thing six years ago five
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:13.520]  years ago because the public really didn't trust them stuff had been coming
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:17.240]  out about it but then since then they have it's got to be tripled the amount
[01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:21.200]  of ads the amount of people that get incentives to give the shots free shots
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:25.560]  when you go in CVS you know a hundred dollars sometimes you go in this clinic
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:29.960]  or that clinic it's being pushed at gas stations it says get a flu shot and they
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:34.320]  got nurses everywhere so record level and then we have record flu and they
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:39.560]  admit doesn't even protect you this shows the total hoax this shows how
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:43.560]  insane is but before you get back into the medical evidence and why it's giving
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:47.360]  rise to these mystery illnesses and what's happening Dr. Group you're a
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:50.760]  healthcare provider you have a lot of sources have you experienced what I just
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:55.160]  mentioned have you heard about it what is going on with this huge push this mind
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:37:00.800]  control that has bullied people into getting the flu shot it's all about
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:05.840]  profit because ten years ago we never had signs and Walgreens in CVS I mean they
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:09.560]  didn't even have flu shots available there so it's a big push because the big
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:13.160]  pharmaceutical companies and the manufacturers it goes deeper than just
[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:17.800]  the manufacturers of the vaccines it goes the flu shot and then what to take
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:21.800]  for the flu shots so you have to link the flu shot profits with the
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:25.680]  antiviral profits with Tamiflu and some of the other ones that are out and it's
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:28.280]  about creating medical tyranny down the road they're just preparing you that
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:31.680]  this is something you must do if there's no doctors visit and there's no need for
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:35.520]  a prescription they've authorized it so anybody behind the counter at Walgreens
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:39.280]  or anybody else can give you the flu shot it's all about money because they
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:45.960]  know that every single year they can get the 300 million doses to children to
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:50.840]  pregnant women to everybody else out of those 300 million doses they're also
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:55.000]  going to get massive side effects Guillain-Barre syndrome neurological
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:00.880]  disorders problems with children they're gonna get excessive prescription
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:06.440]  medication renewals and doctors visits off of that and they're gonna be able to
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:10.040]  send and get the money from the Tamiflu and all the other things that they
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:13.760]  going that they're going to prescribe it and we have newscast after newscast and
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:17.760]  we did a special report last week that Rob do put together where it shows local
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:21.880]  news going this little eight-year-old took the shot was dead two days later we
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:25.200]  don't know why it didn't protect her they don't go the rest of the way all
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:29.040]  these kids take the shot and are dead two days or a week later and no one's
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:33.720]  saying we think the flu shot did it anytime that you have a government that
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:38.520]  passes a bill saying that the vaccine manufacturers are not going to be liable
[01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:44.160]  for any damages caused by the vaccine that should make your hair stand up
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:47.600]  because that just means that there is something wrong with it and that means
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:52.640]  that there's going to be massive injury created they're even working on for
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:58.880]  next year's flu vaccine nanoparticles that can be activated by electromagnetic
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:02.680]  frequencies let's stop right there that was in the BBC just last week we can
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:07.640]  pull that up they call it vaccines which is a small amount of smallpox and then
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:11.440]  you you defeat it when you're healthy you don't get sick when you're unhealthy
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:16.760]  so you don't die again take it the 500 year old theory for those that don't know
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:20.600]  is you take what's bad a little bit of it when you're healthy so that you have a
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:23.920]  chance to beat it and then get the immunity but now the whole science of
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:29.600]  vaccines is nanotech live virus as you name it that literally change the brain
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:34.360]  so you're quote never stressed again or nanotech that change your body this is
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:39.080]  science fiction this is just government injecting stuff in you to change you oh
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:42.840]  the troops won't be depressed anymore I knew about that 10 years ago people
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:46.600]  didn't believe me the last five years it's in the news they're now giving
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:50.360]  troops these shots where they won't be depressed they're the ones that go kill
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:53.800]  themselves because it's a lobotomy basically Dr. Grip I'm ranting go ahead
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:57.400]  no you're you're exactly right we've talked about how many chemicals that
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:00.360]  people are exposed to through the food in the water and everything else and
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:04.360]  there's a lot of different modes of attack the nanoparticles the scary thing
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:08.640]  about it is these could actually be activated with a smart meter I mean if
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:12.240]  you look at the big picture you have all the smart meters on on your homes they
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:15.920]  could be activated with now putting chips and a lot of the new meds coming out
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:19.120]  that you ingest I mean you can see the plan they're putting cell phone towers
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:23.080]  on top of schools right now I mean that's just insane with all the children
[01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:26.160]  being exposed to high levels of electromagnetic radiation they're
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:30.760]  subsidizing the schools even more so the with when you when you link it all
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:34.560]  together and you look at the how they caused the flu by injecting the flu
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:42.280]  vaccine how they use strains that such as the h1n1 which back in 2009 when the
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:48.840]  UK government spent $500 million stockpiling tamiflu and the US
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:54.840]  government spent $1.3 billion stockpiling tamiflu that was five years ago if
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:41:00.640]  you try trace it back to the FDA in the emergency epidemic or pandemic report
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:04.640]  that they put around that they extended the expiration date on tamiflu and some
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:11.680]  of the other antivirals for five years what's five years from 2009 2014 that's
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:17.360]  right where we are right now so why did they put the h1n1 in the 2014 2015
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:22.440]  flu shot it makes you wonder if you go back and you and you look at this trail
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:27.240]  but not only are you damaged from the flu shot let's say you go to the doctor
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:32.680]  and you take tamiflu well there was a doctor in Salt Lake City Dr. Peter
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:38.960]  Silas back in 2009 when the bird flu hit that was one of the leading prescribers
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:43.800]  of tamiflu and he noticed severe effects with the children that he was
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:48.960]  prescribing it to aggression and severe anger one kid actually pushed his
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:52.200]  brother down the stairs and almost killed him because he was on tamiflu
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:59.800]  violence extreme hallucinations mental illness vomiting well they found the
[01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:02.960]  same thing in England and we've been putting the headlines on the screen for
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:06.840]  radio listeners that even government reports admitted it's well basically a
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:11.800]  worthless drug it's all worthless right shots are worthless the tamiflu is
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:15.360]  worthless except it'll give you Alzheimer's and it'll make your kids be
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:20.880]  deformed I mean and they know all this they know it it's sick well one of the
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:26.160]  ways that nobody knows that the pharmaceutical companies cause different
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:30.440]  things with prescription medications is the fillers in the high the things that
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:34.280]  they hide the dangerous substances they hide in the pills let's say you have an
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:37.480]  antibiotic or let's say with tamiflu or something like that it might be a
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:42.400]  thousand milligram capsule you might only have five milligrams of the actual
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:48.160]  ingredient that they're putting in there for example with tamiflu they have FDNC
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:52.280]  blue number two in there which is which is causes brain cancer abnormal cell
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:57.120]  growth hyperactivity they have titanium dioxide which is now being linked to
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:00.860]  fibromyalgia type symptoms all the people that think they have muscle pain
[01:43:00.860 --> 01:43:07.080]  fibromyalgia is linked to titanium dioxide they have sorbitol benzoate they
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:12.960]  even have sodium saccharin saccharin sodium propylene glycol all of that's
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:17.800]  antifreeze that are in is it propylene glycol antifreeze so they put all
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:21.800]  wait a minute you're claiming antifreeze isn't good for me because CBS News says
[01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:25.440]  mercury is good for children then you would think antifreeze is good it don't
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:27.800]  use aren't you supposed to give antifreeze to your cat or dog in their
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:31.320]  water bowl if they're outside to keep their body temperature from freezing yeah
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:35.600]  so so we should do what the government says not be conspiracy theories and we
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:39.040]  should all start drinking antifreeze right of course I'm being sarcastic it
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:42.800]  will cause kidney failure and kill you people use antifreeze to murder their
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:48.520]  spouses folks this is insane say that again antifreeze is in it antifreeze
[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:53.440]  titanium I'm just reading off of a few here there's propylene glycol red 40 blue
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:58.280]  one blue number two artificial flavoring which is most likely MSG and by the way
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:02.920]  the flu shots actually some flu shots this year actually contain MSG
[01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:07.480]  sorbitol monosodium citrate they use that as a brain adjuvant so you they're
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:11.960]  putting in here what we know will jack you up yes and they're putting a lot of
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:16.000]  it in there don't like government have a brain damage shot we only gave the
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:21.880]  black people syphilis ah take the shot ah oh you're having a convulsion trust
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:27.120]  us don't run we're your friends we come in peace how many people do you know
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:30.320]  that actually look up the ingredients in one of the prescription medications
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:34.320]  before they take it if aliens landed and said that they want to work with humans
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:37.240]  and they were gonna give us all this great medical technology and then we
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:42.200]  saw our cancer rates quadruple and we saw our neurological disorders more than
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:46.280]  quadruple and all and deformities increase we would say the aliens are
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:52.040]  jacking with us but our own government's doing it and we just go oh we love you the
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:56.120]  CDC stands for center of disease creation that's all they do they create
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:45:00.080]  disease they work with the pharmaceutical companies the pharmaceutical
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:04.080]  companies pay the top scientists to do the clinical studies the report you're
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:08.280]  talking about is the Cochrane report that came out because the government the
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:12.160]  UK government and the German German government wanted to review the Tama
[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:16.280]  flu because all of a sudden all these governments spent all this money and the
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:20.000]  Cochrane group is some of the top scientists in the world and they
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:25.720]  evaluated first of all Roche who's licensed to produce Tama flu from
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:30.680]  Gilead which you remember Donald Rumsfeld sat on the board of that you can all
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:34.240]  their scam vaccines can trace all this back to the Bush family the Rockefellers
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:38.200]  the Rothschild that was the interest shot wasn't it mmm the Gilead was
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:43.040]  Port Gilead and they had the lab up in Canada they were subcontracting with
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:46.400]  Bioport well they do a lot of the development and then they license it
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:50.520]  out and they license it out so they don't have the liability very loving but
[01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:54.720]  anyway that the Cochrane report did report the Tama flu is basically doesn't
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:58.600]  do anything it doesn't it doesn't reduce yeah the headline was Tama flu stock
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:02.800]  piling worthless right so who paid for all that the taxpayer but I mean if they
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:06.080]  just want to rip us off that's one thing how about hurting us with the deadly
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:11.600]  vaccines right exactly hurting us is a vaccine was never meant to be injected
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:15.880]  directly into the body it's you your immune system doesn't work that way the
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:19.560]  way your immune system works is you breathe it in and your way that your
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:24.560]  receptors react with your white blood cells and your neutrophils they react
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:30.720]  to a antigen to develop an antibody when you shoot anything inside the system
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:36.360]  via a needle nothing like that ever happens in nature so your immune system
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:40.040]  freaks out it causes an immune response and it's hard for your body to develop
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:44.680]  an antibody against it so you have another a lot of different side
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:48.040]  infections too that can happen and believe it or not even with the flu
[01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:52.280]  vaccine it reduces your immune system to the point that a lot of times you get
[01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:57.840]  external or other types of bacterial infections or you get pneumonia you know
[01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:02.000]  this is where the mystery illness thing that comes in there's been about three
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:05.360]  different types or three or four different types of reports that I've
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:11.160]  been seeing with this year's flu one is chronic congestion and sinus malfunction
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:15.280]  the other one is respiratory which I think is the H1N1 strain with a
[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:19.080]  nagging cough that can go on for months and months and months the other is flu
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:22.440]  like symptoms when you're in bed with a fever and the other is something
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:26.840]  associated with the stomach so if you take quadrivalent flu vaccines and you
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:30.320]  mix them and you throw them out there all over the world all that's going to do
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:33.960]  is cause one virus or one influenza virus to mix with another influenza
[01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:38.480]  virus and one influenza to mix with the swine flu and the H1N1 and it's
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:42.360]  going to create all these subcategories and all these other types of flu
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:46.640]  strains that are going to start affecting more and more and more people and
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:50.240]  that's why the CDC announced that we are now pretty much in a pandemic state
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:53.720]  with this year's and then you've also got all the admitted and allowable
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:58.520]  contaminants from these facilities producing vaccines in some of the
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:03.040]  nastiest environments you can imagine where there's just thousands in some
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:09.200]  cases of other viruses bacteria mold just growing in there and then they just
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:14.560]  suck it out mix it together inject it in and you are literally putting monkey
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:19.240]  pus and vomit into your body yes like you said and all these vaccines by the
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:22.800]  way are cultured on some sort of cell culture and most of them are from egg
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:27.120]  like what you said well they started out on dead babies and then they move it
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:30.920]  on to the eggs to mass grow yes that's correct and who knows where these eggs
[01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:33.840]  are coming from and who knows where these canine cells and everything else
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:39.000]  see that's how you can secretly manipulate the RNA in the DNA they
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:43.360]  might say that's a flu vaccine okay they might put influenza viruses in there
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:48.640]  but what's really going on because why do you how are you going to get into the
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:55.000]  human DNA and RNA to change it you have to use a virus as a carrier okay a
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.840]  viruses can go through that's right it's the perfect Trojan horse delivery system
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:04.720]  Trojan horse delivery where you can actually go inside the human cell carry
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:08.480]  you know culture do whatever you're doing to the DNA RNA no one talks about
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:12.520]  that no one knows what they're doing to that okay why are they putting RNA and
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:16.720]  DNA fragments in the flu vaccine why why isn't it just influenza a they're
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:20.080]  doing something to the RNA and the DNA and they're using the virus well we know
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:24.400]  we know and look they Trojan horse the cell phones the computers the TVs the
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:27.680]  medical stuff this government's been caught thousands of times in lethal
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:32.920]  testing on whites blacks it doesn't matter they've been caught we would be
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:37.280]  insane to take this stuff just like in India and Africa they run from the
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:44.240]  vaccine trucks they know they do I mean it's simple they're killing us and
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:48.280]  you're right they're putting Trojan horse if 50 years ago they were putting
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:51.800]  Trojan horse cancer viruses in people to reduce population that trigger when
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:55.200]  hormone levels drop as scientists have broken down they're designed to kill you
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:58.720]  after you retire they don't want to pay out your social security wonder what the
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:02.440]  new stuff is well we know it's behavior modification and we know they've got
[01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:06.240]  viruses tailored that attacks certain receptors in the brain and that's what
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:09.600]  they're doing to it they're obviously targeting different DNA and RNA pairs
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:12.480]  within us for the people that are getting the flu shot and that's right if
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:16.240]  you know it we're gonna skip this one network break this is so important I
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:20.040]  want you to be able to finish this point go ahead well the strange thing is that
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:24.280]  the vaccines a lot of them they're not made exactly the same and there's
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:28.760]  alterations that are going on within especially the live vaccines so you
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:33.600]  might have a bad that we're showing brain cells and what mercury does to
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:39.000]  that's what mercury does to brain cells when it hits it just completely
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:46.600]  takes all the coding the fibral the neurofibral coding of the nerve so that's
[01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:50.360]  an important video but we have one that's the electron microscope I think
[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:54.480]  it's pig brain and mercury and you can just see it basically electrochemically
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:51:00.960]  explode mm-hmm but I mean that's good for you because the fed said ten years
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:06.000]  ago journal pediatrics mercury helps children's behavior not hurts it well
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.520]  yeah if you want drooling zombies to the lawyer speak then yeah it does help the
[01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:14.400]  behavior because we were dead that would be better for them well it's the flu
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:17.800]  vaccine is just nothing more than an experiment it's a social experiment too
[01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:22.080]  because if it if we really had like let's say three flu vaccines that were
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:25.880]  approved by the FDA and then all the doctors all over the United States got
[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:29.760]  those three flu vaccines but that's not the way it works all the lots are
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:34.920]  different some lots are have more mercury than others and this part of the
[01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:39.000]  country gets a certain amount of this vaccines these doctors get certain
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:42.800]  vaccines these doctors get certain flu shot and by the way that was declassified
[01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:47.480]  six years ago in China Germany in the UK they quote secret program where they
[01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:52.240]  get quote clean vaccines so they're actually getting real vaccines and then
[01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:55.880]  we don't sorry interrupted you know what I'm saying is it's the it's very
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:59.280]  strange the way they're doing it they're almost creating it like let's say we
[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:03.960]  want the southern United States to have more of the h1n1 we want the west
[01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:08.400]  you western United States to have more of the influenza a and you can actually
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:12.000]  see that on the documents we showed earlier that in the different regions
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:16.000]  you're seeing more of one individual virus than the other one so it's almost
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:23.840]  planned it's a planned attack I think we should trust them I trust Monsanto
[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:27.680]  well I don't know I mean so what have been all the studies the BT corn within
[01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:31.120]  three generations kills all the guinea pigs or makes them deformed with with
[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:34.360]  their organs outside their body and hair growing out of their mouths and we
[01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:37.280]  see similar things starting to happen with humans what's wrong with that
[01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:40.520]  information isn't it a gift from Monsanto to have a deformed baby
[01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:45.960]  information is power so I mean if you know about this it doesn't take long to
[01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:51.040]  look up flu shot dangers no I'm not gonna read the insert where it admits it
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:54.640]  could kill me I'm just gonna take it because you're gonna listen to your
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:58.200]  doctor and the next time somebody bosses me around I'm gonna say yes sir you're
[01:52:58.200 --> 01:53:02.440]  right thank you no actually I say to him look you need to not be aggressive
[01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:05.760]  you've just doubled your chances all time we're taking three of those shots you
[01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:09.680]  take it every year oh look your hands shaking what are you like 55 you're
[01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:12.640]  gonna be dead soon get out of my face that's what I tell him I go you go tell
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:16.120]  somebody else to kill themselves not me and they start getting smart mouth I go
[01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:19.560]  you heard it's this giggy dumbass because I use that because you might have
[01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:24.360]  heard about that you think I trust this government you stupid punk get out of my
[01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:28.240]  face I've actually done that I'm sick of these people man that nurse started
[01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:31.600]  shooting her mouth off me in that elevator with these two guys she had
[01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:35.280]  with her this we're doing some in-call visit you know like do medical stuff and
[01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:39.720]  I just said listen shut your fat mouth I mean we need to get aggressive with them
[01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:44.000]  they're trying to bully us we know the facts we know mercury and good for kids
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:49.800]  brains tell them to go get a vaccine they put that well they're already you
[01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:53.960]  mean the the scary thing is all the health care workers all over the nation
[01:53:53.960 --> 01:53:58.680]  are being forced to get vaccinated or if they don't they have to wear masks well
[01:53:58.680 --> 01:54:02.200]  that's part of the occult brainwashing is that they just make them get into this
[01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:05.600]  cult so now that they've been forced to do it you're gonna do it that's right
[01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:09.240]  you're not gonna give me the flu take it well wait a minute you just took the
[01:54:09.240 --> 01:54:15.000]  shot you're protected dummy before we go any further let's talk about info wars
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.720]  life calm products I was asking you personally I was telling you what I'm
[01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:23.360]  doing to try to avoid the flu at my family sunlight rest healthy non-gmo
[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:28.320]  lots of purified water a survival shield X to supermail vitality I'm just
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:31.080]  going ahead because of bacteria and stuff taken the silver bullet during this
[01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:35.280]  winter season info wars life calm talk about the resolution pack talk about
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:40.360]  these products you developed well the products are all really a way to keep
[01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:45.440]  yourself healthy keep yourself strong keep your mind alert and ways to the
[01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:50.000]  information out there is ways that you can learn about all the different ways
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:54.560]  the globalist agenda the population control agenda how you can protect your
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:59.720]  family how you can keep your body clean because really the attack the major
[01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:04.280]  attack is on our health and our mental ability they want us dumbed down they
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:09.400]  want us to be non-aggressive they want to be able to control our cells at it at
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:13.880]  a cellular level they want to reduce our spirituality are you saying Obama's
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:18.960]  wrong to teach triple two equals five Obama's racist well you know what two
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:21.840]  plus two equals five people will probably start believing that pretty
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:25.480]  soon because they won't be able to their they won't have any brain activity left
[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:30.800]  to be able to add properly I mean that's it's gone I know you are racist it used
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:37.320]  to be able to you used to be able to attack the adults but the thing is they
[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:41.720]  figured there's so much profit in pharmaceuticals and flu shots that now
[01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:46.040]  it's all the way down to children and hurt them early they can medicalize them
[01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:50.880]  early and really suck a lot out they can get them for their whole lives whole
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:54.560]  lives and from what I know none of the doctors I know none of the nurses that
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:58.920]  are smart none of them take the vaccine it's like dr. Oz said I don't get my
[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:02.640]  kids to shop but you should take it we have that clip yeah but he had to say
[01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:07.440]  I don't take it but here's the good news I mean thinking about the positive side
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:10.800]  not trying to be fear mongering is there's ways around it and that's why
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:15.880]  we're here is to teach people about this because we do the research we track it
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:20.160]  all the way back down and we say okay don't get your flu shot tell everybody
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:24.640]  you know protect your family protect your kids unfortunately this year with
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:30.600]  this flu shot you know people that are very even healthy that are exposed to a
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:34.440]  new virus might get sick and might get the flu and that's just the way it goes
[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:37.440]  but if they have a strong immune system they're gonna be able to fight us they
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:41.040]  admit here's one and guardian doesn't protect you just show this to your
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:45.400]  friends and family it doesn't do anything the minute this happened they
[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:48.960]  should have recalled it all but it's never worked nicely just a plug here
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:54.880]  you were telling me survival shield x2 is it is a great thing I guess it's
[01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:59.520]  antiviral bacterial you name it what else of the family of products is the
[01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:02.800]  best out there to bolster immune system the oxy powder flushing the guts out
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:07.800]  I've done that that's amazing we've got 48% off super mill vitality or super
[01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:13.240]  female vitality the mythical bollum and vitamin B12 and then you add to that the
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:18.480]  oxy powder 48% off that special does in today I said I'd extended through today
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:23.960]  that it will end this evening you've got 48% off on that your purchase helps
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:27.800]  support the broadcast do you believe that pack you help us put together is a
[01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:30.800]  smart resolution to be healthy and have a good immune system about the group
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:37.000]  absolutely I mean the oxy powder I love the iodine just because of the fact that
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:41.400]  there's nothing that can live in an iodine environment so it's a very strong
[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:46.360]  antimicrobial silver is always one of my favorite things silver bullet to take
[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:50.040]  and really you know increasing your water content with apple cider vinegar
[01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:54.920]  believe it or not you can even cut some onions and put them around your house if
[01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:58.720]  or anytime you have people coming over you're gonna be around because the
[01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:02.760]  onions the gas from the onions actually have been shown to reduce and to kill
[01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:06.080]  any type of influenza in the air it's kind of one of those natural remedies
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:11.720]  that's the old Transylvanian thing of like garlic and onions keeps the devil away right but all of
[01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:15.920]  the things in the infowars life product line would be effective it's because
[01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:20.080]  it's all about addressing the root cause of the problem strengthening your

[01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:52.680]  another major health threat this one in Toledo Ohio where everybody in the
[01:58:52.680 --> 01:58:56.760]  entire city has been told not to drink the water Ohio governor declaring a
[01:58:56.760 --> 01:59:01.520]  state of emergency did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:06.880]  gallons of water at home every single day if there's a water emergency will
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:11.120]  you be prepared panic residents forming long lines throughout the day we're

[02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:26.360]  Dr. Group we got five more minutes left with you you hadn't even gotten into the
[02:00:26.360 --> 02:00:31.720]  bowel statistics Bill Gates is making his main focus the bowel that he believes
[02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:34.880]  with the new big profit center because they help screw it up so much with the
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:39.240]  BT corn and the rest of it get into some of those numbers they tie into the
[02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:43.280]  oxy powder well you know I've always said that everything starts in the bow
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:46.880]  all the chemicals that are out there all the tech toxins in the water the food
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:50.120]  and everything the main exposure point is the bow and that's really been the
[02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:55.520]  focus on my research and finding out what the root cause of all disease is
[02:00:55.520 --> 02:00:58.920]  every single thing comes in through the bow so that's been my focus is to keep
[02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:04.120]  the bow clean one of the things I wanted to do is was let people know exactly how
[02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:09.960]  stopped up America really is some of these statistics less than 50% of people
[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:15.120]  have one bow movement a day and by the way the attack on the bow traces back
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:19.080]  that's a whole nother show but this is all been done by design because they
[02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:23.240]  know how important the appendix is they know important how important the bow
[02:01:23.240 --> 02:01:27.520]  is and they know if they clog the bowel up they cause leaky gut syndrome all of
[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:32.160]  that stuff is going to be directly into the bloodstream they know the liver is
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:36.240]  going to be you mean the government that put ISIS in control to kill 300,000
[02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:40.560]  innocent Syrians might want to hurt me that they're not nice the government
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:44.000]  really doesn't know about it we're talking about the social engineers the
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:47.040]  real government club of Rome we're talking about the real you know the
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:51.080]  real deal guys that that everything comes down upon and that's why Bill Gates
[02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:54.720]  is getting into the bow thing right now because he knows also and they know
[02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:58.600]  that they want to destroy the bow a hundred million people in the United
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:03.680]  States suffer from constipation people spend 800 million a year on
[02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:09.280]  constipation relief products there's 700 or more varieties of over-the-counter
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:14.280]  and prescription laxatives available now prescription laxatives and over-the-counter
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:19.000]  laxatives guess who owns that see we talk about pharmaceutical companies all
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:23.520]  the time I mean as far as prescribing drugs but the whole other arm of
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:28.960]  pharmaceutical companies is the OTC drug arm the all of the things that you do
[02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:34.840]  not need a doctor per to prescribe and those are just as profitable if not
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:39.560]  more profitable than the drugs prescribed by the doctors that's why the flu
[02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:43.120]  vaccines and the flu shots to are so profitable because doctors do not need
[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:47.120]  to prescribe them and that's why the psychotropic drugs are so profitable
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:51.880]  because any doctor can prescribe those without any type of lab work without
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:56.520]  any type of diagnostic testing without anything that costs money and that has
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:03:04.000]  some form of traceable documentation so all these things really have you don't
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.920]  need to go to the doctor's office you don't need to have blood work done you
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:09.840]  don't need to have MRIs done there's nothing traceable you come in and you
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:14.640]  say I'm biting my fingernails well you have a so obsessive compulsive disorder
[02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:17.920]  here's some psychotropic drugs for it everybody's got a mental illness and
[02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:20.480]  the state's going to take your rights away to keep you safe so listen to this
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:27.120]  a 50 billion a year industry just on prescription drugs Lipitor 7.2 billion
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:32.520]  dollars last year for the pharmaceutical companies Nexium and acid drug
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:40.240]  okay 6.3 billion drug 6.3 billion the list goes on and these are just the top
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:46.320]  10 actually of the prescription medications you have a bill of five well
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:52.480]  anti-psychotic drug 4.6 billion asthma inhaler 4.7 let's do all the
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:56.480]  chemtrails in the air and get everybody on that on having asthma problems and
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:00.840]  let's sell 4.7 billion in asthma drugs cholesterol lowering drugs that's right
[02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:05.200]  and have the government do it in a secret geoengineering program paid for by
[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:08.560]  taxpayers and then Bill Gates gets part of the money because he runs part of the
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:13.800]  program and that's on record no I know these people are scientists of evil
[02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:19.000]  scientists of evil and what they're banking on is that the general public
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:25.680]  will not know or never find out how easy it is to eliminate all the conditions
[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:28.880]  that they have and address the root cause of their problem which is too many

[02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:28.120]  Texas Austin and coming up in a few minutes George Norrie the second most
[02:08:28.120 --> 02:08:32.040]  syndicated talk show host in the world behind a rush limbaugh good friend of
[02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:37.720]  mine been going on his broadcast now for hard to believe 12 13 years he is
[02:08:37.720 --> 02:08:42.920]  joining us to talk about the waterfront I want to get into these attacks in
[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:46.400]  Europe and the calls to take our liberties and pass SOPA and SISPA to
[02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:49.760]  restrict freedom I thought we're gonna stand up against threats and not get
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:54.160]  rid of free speech we're gonna get into health news and so much more in fact I
[02:08:54.160 --> 02:08:57.640]  know George Norrie back when they had the model states health emergency
[02:08:57.640 --> 02:09:02.920]  powers act was the only national big host to say hey we shouldn't have a
[02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:07.440]  government law making you take a shot and he was pointing out that this was
[02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:12.200]  medical tyranny and that got turned around we had the anthrax shots killing
[02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:16.360]  trips turned out those were very toxic so I'm gonna get George's take on what
[02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:20.120]  we just covered in the last hour first I know he's done a lot of research on
[02:09:20.120 --> 02:09:24.320]  that and interviewed so many virologist and medical doctors record amounts of
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:29.280]  flu this year record amounts of people getting the flu vaccine and I showed the
[02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:32.960]  London Guardian last hour where they admit it's not the right strain it
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:37.120]  doesn't protect you they've never guessed the right strain so we'll we'll talk to
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:40.080]  him but I want to start going to the studio and folks in there on the
[02:09:40.080 --> 02:09:44.120]  control board Leigh Ann McAdoo as a great reporter and researcher but she's
[02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:48.080]  also helping run the show today she's there with Joe Jennings Leigh Ann I
[02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:52.680]  briefly wanted to get your take on that last hour the mystery illnesses directly
[02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:56.720]  linked to the flu vaccine the neurological disorders off the charts
[02:09:56.720 --> 02:10:01.520]  this is bigger than profit this is about social control what was your take on
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:06.160]  that well I just think it's insanity that they keep pushing the vaccines even
[02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:10.360]  though like this it's not gonna protect you from this year's flu but get it
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:15.040]  anyway and and it reminds you of when we did that undercover report and they
[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:19.520]  were telling me I said you know I think I'm pregnant should I still get the flu
[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:25.040]  shot and she's like yeah you know it has the the Marisol in it Mercury is good
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:31.800]  for you apparently but looking at the vaccine insert that they admit that they
[02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:37.520]  haven't tested the how the flu will affect fetal development it hasn't been
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:41.600]  tested on people younger than five exactly and until six years ago every
[02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:45.880]  insert every doctor said never anybody who has kids knows this anybody who's
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:51.480]  had a wife knows this a pregnant woman never takes a vaccine because it's
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:56.120]  linked to all sorts of deformities all sorts of miscarriages it's just known
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:11:00.200]  but they tripled down a few years ago and said you know what pregnant women
[02:11:00.200 --> 02:11:06.040]  need double exactly that get two flu shots I mean this this is so evil what
[02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:09.760]  do you think's behind it Leanne it must be something evil because I mentioned
[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:14.160]  that in the report as well with the H1N1 and they were recommending women get
[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:20.200]  two shots and then they had a record amount of spontaneous abortions they
[02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:24.400]  were calling these miscarriages of pregnant women because they were giving
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:27.800]  them double doses well it's the UN program they've been caught in India
[02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:31.640]  giving them shots that make them have miscarriages and that's what this is
[02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:37.000]  and they just cover it up I mean this is so evil people ask how did Nazi Germany
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:41.160]  happen it was kept covert the average German really didn't know what was
[02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:44.040]  happening at the end of the war folks thought they were making it up but it
[02:11:44.040 --> 02:11:48.000]  turned out they were naive some of them live right next door to death camps and
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.720]  just believe the cover story Leanne thank you for your take on that we've now
[02:11:51.720 --> 02:11:56.480]  got George Norrie of Coast to Coast AM.com on the line he also hosts a
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:12:01.060]  popular television show he's on shows on sci-fi channel you name it and he

[02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:24.680]  issues. Wow Alex first of all like congratulations on your new television

[02:12:57.480 --> 02:13:04.080]  every story that breaks is a conspiracy but you got to look at all of them and
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:09.480]  say who benefits who profits why is this happening and that's what's going on on
[02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:15.800]  this planet right now it's almost as if we can't keep track of how much is
[02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:23.080]  occurring worldwide it's a wonder that people are so frustrated I have been
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:28.000]  talking with some guests of ours on coast to coast one in particular psychiatrist
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:33.160]  Dr. Peter Breggen and you know he is so opposed to pharmaceutical law
[02:13:33.160 --> 02:13:38.360]  medicines and what he believes is over prescribing of America when he's and
[02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:44.120]  he's right but my question to him was Peter as a psychiatrist why are people
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:50.320]  so tight why are they so upset about everything and he said just look at the
[02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:56.240]  state of affairs people are on the edge of their seats and they're waiting for
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:14:01.320]  the other shoe to fall and they just they can't handle it anymore
[02:14:01.320 --> 02:14:06.280]  well George you're absolutely right and if you look at what they've medically
[02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:11.520]  proven scientifically proven that mammals but other animals as well no one
[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:16.160]  tornadoes coming when our earthquakes coming sometimes days before birds and
[02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:21.560]  seals navigate by the Earth's magnetic field we know humans do that as well and
[02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:27.280]  we have a sixth sense that is picking up that there is a real evil behind this
[02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:31.720]  global government and now we've gone from most of what we would cover 15 years
[02:14:31.720 --> 02:14:37.960]  ago being denied to now so much of it is in our face yeah your television does
[02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:42.080]  listen to you and watch you watch what you say you know Samsung came out and
[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:45.760]  said yeah we are recording everything shut up but other companies do it as well
[02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:50.440]  stuff that is so bizarre yeah there's a box in all the cars now that have been
[02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:54.320]  made the last 10 years worldwide we're gonna start taxing you by the mile we're
[02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:58.560]  gonna track you yeah you know what we did put cancer viruses in the shot it
[02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:02.200]  killed a bunch of people big deal I mean I can play clips of the inventor of the
[02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:07.560]  of the polio shot saying that why do you think they're flaunting it in our face
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:12.520]  so much because it's the best of times worst of times they're flaunting it but
[02:15:12.520 --> 02:15:17.680]  people are waking up but then they say what do you do about it well that's
[02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:23.240]  exactly why they flaunt it it's one of those situations where they flaunt it
[02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:28.680]  because they believe there's nothing we can do about it they're not correct and
[02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:34.640]  they'll find out but they do they just lay it right out there for you in the
[02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:40.640]  old days the old days of what we did Alex on radio and on television it wasn't
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:45.160]  that evident it was there it was an undertone and now you know the
[02:15:45.160 --> 02:15:50.000]  Bilderberg meetings and the things that were so secret of Bohemian Grove that
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:56.120]  you infiltrated in such a great way those are done very quietly in those days
[02:15:56.120 --> 02:16:01.840]  you know now you know things are coming a little more forthright because they
[02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:07.040]  just don't care anymore they figure you know there's nothing these people can do
[02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:13.040]  so let's just do it and be done with it are secret things beyond that still
[02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:17.320]  going on there's no question about it I mean there was a report today that
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:23.360]  billionaire George Soros may have helped fund the Ferguson uprising in my
[02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:29.960]  home area of the same 33 million dollars yeah 33 million dollars how could you
[02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:34.240]  spend that kind of money for demonstrations and stuff but you know
[02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:38.840]  what who knows but you know I'm glad you raised that George because I know you
[02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:41.840]  don't get into just you know political bomb throwing you just covered the facts
[02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:46.240]  and let folks make their own decision but George Soros just every time you
[02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:50.720]  turn over a rock or something bad's happening he's there I mean what is his
[02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:55.720]  problem he is there and God knows how much money he has to play with geez
[02:16:55.720 --> 02:17:02.560]  it's incredible but you know what these people Alex are so bored with their own
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:07.960]  lives that they've got to screw up everybody else's in order to get their
[02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:14.080]  little jolly it's truly unbelievable I mean you would think that people with
[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:19.000]  this kind of wealth would enjoy themselves and simply just have a nice
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:24.080]  life help other people but you know this clandestine stuff that they do and
[02:17:24.080 --> 02:17:30.600]  this uprising and let's let's create more strife and you know let's put the
[02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:34.720]  wedge between people I mean it's it's it's ludicrous it really is it's sad
[02:17:34.720 --> 02:17:39.720]  actually well the good news is that he's getting identified there's so much to get
[02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:43.920]  into I've got questions of the economy on what happened in France on the move
[02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:47.760]  to reintroduce CISPA that's now happened yesterday there's so much to cover but I
[02:17:47.760 --> 02:17:52.040]  love the wild card George what do you want to get into first here today well
[02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:55.920]  there's so many things that have been going on Alex and first of all I want
[02:17:55.920 --> 02:18:01.080]  to continue to congratulate you for doing the things that you've been doing
[02:18:01.080 --> 02:18:06.400]  that have been cutting edge I thank God years ago when I got that one phone
[02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:12.280]  caller from a coast to coast listener and an Alex Jones fan who came on my
[02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:16.360]  show and said hey you gotta you gotta have this talk show host Alex Jones on
[02:18:16.360 --> 02:18:21.400]  and I didn't know who you were at that time and I'm going what do I want to
[02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:25.760]  put another talk show host on my show for and he said trust me trust me do some
[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:30.360]  homework and I did and I remember inviting you on for the first time and
[02:18:30.360 --> 02:18:35.720]  I bet you were shocked when that first call came and said we wanted to put you
[02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:39.640]  on coast to coast I was most talk show hosts are complete ego maniacs and only
[02:18:39.640 --> 02:18:42.760]  care about their own narcissism but I know that you were more interested in
[02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:46.120]  the story and actually getting the word out that's why I also interview other
[02:18:46.120 --> 02:18:50.960]  talk show host because it's just so interesting and Michael Savages had me
[02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:54.800]  on his show some he comes on my show I think we're the only three national
[02:18:54.800 --> 02:18:58.280]  talk show host you guys are obviously bigger than I am in terrestrial radio
[02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:06.360]  by several light years you know by tens of millions it just gets back to we're
[02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:11.600]  into freedom and into having a real debate versus just being the biggest
[02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:16.720]  ego in town and I think the American people have that same world view they
[02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:21.320]  don't care about the egos or the names or who's the best they only care about
[02:19:21.320 --> 02:19:25.440]  getting their basic freedoms back because people are really concerned and no
[02:19:25.440 --> 02:19:30.520]  amount of martial law garbage or race war stuff that Soros is trying to stir
[02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:35.880]  up will fix it George there's no doubt about it in your listeners Alex and our
[02:19:35.880 --> 02:19:41.160]  listeners at coast to coast and many of them crossover are so intelligent so
[02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:47.120]  into it I'm proud when I go on the air every night I'm proud to know that the
[02:19:47.120 --> 02:19:50.760]  people who are listening to my show the people who are listening to your show
[02:19:50.760 --> 02:19:55.880]  are on it oh yeah they're a lot smarter than I am in many cases oh my gosh what

[02:23:31.160 --> 02:23:34.960]  symptoms associated with diabetes I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar and
[02:23:34.960 --> 02:23:38.160]  I've been getting the foot pain as well but I've noticed in the past week or so

[02:24:13.640 --> 02:24:16.880]  run on for a long time George Norrie
[02:24:16.880 --> 02:24:23.880]  coast2coastam.com host is our guest and we are picking his brain today George I
[02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:27.520]  want to get your take because I know you watched it closely and covered it on the
[02:24:27.520 --> 02:24:33.280]  attacks in Paris you know that when I was a guest on your broadcast just about a
[02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:39.400]  month or two ago I went on to predict yet again it's not hard to predict it that
[02:24:39.400 --> 02:24:44.520]  the fact that the West helped ISIS and Al Qaeda get a base in Syria and Iraq that
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:49.480]  they would then begin attacking us I'm not saying the government runs it but on
[02:24:49.480 --> 02:24:54.760]  record they helped give them a new base and then gave them weapons so now we see
[02:24:54.760 --> 02:24:59.200]  moves to take our basic freedoms to censor the internet give me your take
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:04.120]  on the Paris attacks the tragic attacks and I want to ask you the question is
[02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:12.720]  does this signify a new asymmetrical 9-11 situation well it's amazing that we
[02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:18.840]  seem to get in bed with people who turn on us Alex after we've helped them and
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:25.280]  fund them I mean Al Qaeda for example they were the Mujahideen in Afghanistan
[02:25:25.280 --> 02:25:28.920]  when they wanted to get the Soviet Union out at the time we of course funded
[02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:34.360]  them and Osama bin Laden and look what they did they turned on us with knowledge
[02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:39.240]  of course by so many people within government in this particular case you're
[02:25:39.240 --> 02:25:46.760]  absolutely right ISIS who many of these whack jobs are members of we're
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:53.360]  financed by us you know we wanted to get the Assad out of Syria and we wanted to
[02:25:53.360 --> 02:25:58.680]  continue to do what was going on in Iraq so we funded them and these
[02:25:58.680 --> 02:26:02.920]  people got a little too big for their britches and started doing things on
[02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:08.440]  their own and now the entire Middle East is up in arms over all of this the
[02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:13.960]  Paris situation was sad and I've talked about it on our program quite a bit
[02:26:13.960 --> 02:26:19.400]  it's tragic but I've got to tell you something but the magazine you know I
[02:26:19.400 --> 02:26:23.720]  believe in freedom of speech these people are entitled to do what they want
[02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:29.280]  and say what they want without fear of somebody trying to shoot them or kill
[02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:33.720]  them because of their views I mean God knows look away you and I have said on
[02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:38.440]  the air over all these years but we have that right to say that but there comes
[02:26:38.440 --> 02:26:44.400]  responsibility with that there comes consequences with that and by you know
[02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:51.640]  making these what I believe to be cruel pictorials of the Prophet Muhammad
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:56.960]  they've attacked Jewish people they've attacked Catholic people in this
[02:26:56.960 --> 02:27:03.400]  magazine in a very cruel way I don't find it to be humorous at all you're
[02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:06.840]  going to create some problems and you're going to create animosity so the big
[02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:13.480]  question is is would this Paris event have occurred had this magazine not kept
[02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:20.480]  pushing its cartoonish figures on Muhammad and in flaming continuing to
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:27.840]  inflame radicals who are already whacked out and my answer to that is is
[02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:32.160]  probably not these you know people would have been alive and then it's
[02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:36.360]  festered into the delicatessen shootings and everything else but there's no
[02:27:36.360 --> 02:27:42.640]  question there's mass hatred out there of the Western world and people who have
[02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:50.600]  freedom but a lot of that goes both ways and you know sometimes I think maybe as
[02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:55.440]  a country we should simply say you people handle your own problems and you get
[02:27:55.440 --> 02:28:00.720]  out and I'm going to cite Saudi Arabia for an example we deal with Saudi Arabia
[02:28:00.720 --> 02:28:06.320]  for one reason they have oil Saudi Arabia may be one of the most
[02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:14.000]  despicable countries on the planet they behead people they chop off arms if you
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:20.560]  rob something and we put up with that if that happens in any other country that
[02:28:20.560 --> 02:28:24.760]  we're not getting anything from we either go in there and try to attack them
[02:28:24.760 --> 02:28:29.840]  or take them over or sanctions you name it sure Saudi Arabia may be one of the
[02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:33.920]  only countries as bad as North Korea I mean if they catch a woman driving a
[02:28:33.920 --> 02:28:38.720]  car without authorization until a few years ago they would execute them yeah
[02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:44.200]  yeah or lash them and everything else it's crazy so where are the feminists
[02:28:44.200 --> 02:28:47.960]  complaining about radical Islam and Saudi Arabia they don't do that they
[02:28:47.960 --> 02:28:52.640]  just criticize men wearing pants in America yeah absolutely and the and the
[02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:57.320]  women in those countries who do complain they get muffled pretty darn fast I
[02:28:57.320 --> 02:29:03.160]  think what this Paris episode is showing us is that it's gonna happen again and
[02:29:03.160 --> 02:29:07.760]  it's gonna happen in the United States it's gonna happen in other countries as
[02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:15.760]  well you know the line has been drawn and the radicals who hate us are going to
[02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:22.400]  do what they do and this is to this is sadly going to happen I think for the
[02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:26.400]  rest of our lifetime and George I want to talk about this eternal war like the
[02:29:26.400 --> 02:29:29.800]  war on drugs they're calling it getting ready for the next big wave they say
[02:29:29.800 --> 02:29:34.880]  it's quote metastasized and it's gonna be much bigger how do we stop that from

[02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:07.360]  perfect place but if you don't fight for a level playing field you will be
[02:34:07.360 --> 02:34:11.880]  screwed over you will be enslaved tors nori is our guest and that was my next
[02:34:11.880 --> 02:34:15.240]  question for him that's where he went before i even asked it they're saying
[02:34:15.240 --> 02:34:20.040]  get ready for a quote metastasization that was the just department two days
[02:34:20.040 --> 02:34:24.440]  ago in the associate of press it's like the war on drugs it'll never end so the
[02:34:24.440 --> 02:34:28.360]  border basically stays wide open and these terrorists have facebook's and say
[02:34:28.360 --> 02:34:31.360]  what they're gonna do time and time again they're on no fly list because good
[02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:36.080]  parts of agencies put them on there then they're still allowed to fly around it's
[02:34:36.080 --> 02:34:39.520]  clear they're being used radical islamists and others to take our
[02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:44.720]  freedoms meanwhile homeland security admits their main training is for
[02:34:44.720 --> 02:34:48.080]  veterans gun owners libertarians conservatives which in the just
[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:53.360]  department's own crime statistics have the lowest level of antisocial behavior
[02:34:53.360 --> 02:34:57.480]  and criminal activity mean go to a tea party event folks and drop a wallet with
[02:34:57.480 --> 02:35:01.800]  a thousand bucks in it in the middle of them nobody's taking it everybody knows
[02:35:01.800 --> 02:35:07.040]  that and these implications in the news the tea party's gonna kill cops they're
[02:35:07.040 --> 02:35:12.040]  gonna blow stuff up get ready for the bombs if they ever start staging this
[02:35:12.040 --> 02:35:15.280]  stuff and saying the tea party did it it's pretty obvious i mean george you're
[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:20.480]  a newsman before you got to talk radio 20 years ago there at the night hawk out
[02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:24.040]  of st louis and we're then number one they got picked up to host cus to cus and
[02:35:24.040 --> 02:35:28.120]  even a fabulous job since art bell retired i should add it took the show i
[02:35:28.120 --> 02:35:31.800]  think in a great direction of covering more politics and analysis and also the
[02:35:31.800 --> 02:35:35.480]  fun stuff the interesting stuff i like to hear about comments and you know an
[02:35:35.480 --> 02:35:40.760]  old lady saw her backyard but looking at this isn't it obvious and i'm putting
[02:35:40.760 --> 02:35:43.680]  words your mouth give me your take on this when they're like patriots are
[02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:47.040]  gonna blow stuff up patriots are gonna nuke a city you know those
[02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:51.360]  conservatives they're terrorists and there's none of it going on nothing
[02:35:51.360 --> 02:35:55.560]  happening no evidence you covered oklahoma city when it happened clearly
[02:35:55.560 --> 02:36:01.680]  bare minimum a provocateur false flag but in your own words they're getting us
[02:36:01.680 --> 02:36:06.560]  ready they say for a war with the tea party as if we're the terrorist i mean
[02:36:06.560 --> 02:36:11.920]  how ominous is that where they're trying to criminalize opposition to
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:15.480]  socialism in this country do you get concerned they could stage false flags
[02:36:15.480 --> 02:36:20.160]  and blame it on patriots oh there's no question about it i mean i'm not as you
[02:36:20.160 --> 02:36:25.240]  well know alex i don't think that there's a conspiracy under every rock but
[02:36:25.240 --> 02:36:29.760]  they do happen and do have to investigate it and you do have to weigh the
[02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:35.920]  possibilities i mean for example years ago in the 50s i mean they sprayed
[02:36:35.920 --> 02:36:41.960]  biologicals or the people of st louis testing it and they denied it for years
[02:36:41.960 --> 02:36:47.360]  until we uncovered it you know seven eight nine years ago they tested and
[02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:55.560]  sprayed sailors and ships they are capable of doing anything they need to do
[02:36:55.560 --> 02:37:00.840]  to up end this world and here's the sad part of the whole thing if we had a
[02:37:00.840 --> 02:37:06.040]  perfect world a perfect planet where everybody got along that there were no
[02:37:06.040 --> 02:37:13.640]  wars there were there were no problems i am convinced that the elitists would
[02:37:13.640 --> 02:37:20.640]  create terrorism would create wars just to keep the apple cart upended just to
[02:37:20.640 --> 02:37:27.400]  keep the industrial military complex profitable and that's the sad part of
[02:37:27.400 --> 02:37:32.480]  all this because you just don't know anymore who to trust who to go through
[02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:36.640]  you know you and i if you and i were running countries and we got together
[02:37:36.640 --> 02:37:41.800]  and went out got a drink came back and settled everything and you know we
[02:37:41.800 --> 02:37:46.280]  began building a great planet for each other there's going to be somebody else
[02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:50.080]  out there that says wait a minute wait a minute how do we get involved how do we
[02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:56.440]  profit from this so they have ended nori and jones have ended terrorism across
[02:37:56.440 --> 02:38:01.920]  the planet so we better do it and because of that i don't think it'll
[02:38:01.920 --> 02:38:07.840]  ever end it'll never end that's extremely poignant and in central there
[02:38:07.840 --> 02:38:11.000]  was a report i think two years ago out of a major british think tank i forget
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:17.360]  the exact headline i think it was like top geopolitical expert governments want
[02:38:17.360 --> 02:38:21.880]  crises and it was a big report with a bunch of experts breaking it down
[02:38:21.880 --> 02:38:28.040]  proving cases where north korea china the us russia they all do it israel
[02:38:28.040 --> 02:38:33.400]  mexico will stir up a crisis or make it worse so special interest can get no bid
[02:38:33.400 --> 02:38:37.880]  contracts i mean it really comes down to just corrupt interest that aren't don't
[02:38:37.880 --> 02:38:41.480]  even have an ideology they just want power and control are they're doing
[02:38:41.480 --> 02:38:45.480]  everything they can to stir the pot look at george soros trying to fund the
[02:38:45.480 --> 02:38:48.760]  stuff against the police and obviously there are bad cops and there is
[02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:52.680]  corruption but those bad cops in albuquerque just got charged who clearly
[02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:56.680]  i think executed that guy but at the same time the attempt to scapegoat the
[02:38:56.680 --> 02:39:01.000]  police the system knows soros knows congress has eight percent approval
[02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:04.920]  rating eighty plus percent don't trust the government the gallup poll show if
[02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:08.360]  you can make it about the cops and attack them
[02:39:08.360 --> 02:39:11.880]  then you're not going to get any reform but if you hype everybody up soros
[02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:15.960]  uses money to get people to try to you know create a good
[02:39:15.960 --> 02:39:19.880]  government it would probably work so it shows how
[02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:24.200]  spiders like him make their money out of crises
[02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:27.240]  and out of a war economies like he did in world war two
[02:39:27.240 --> 02:39:31.800]  doing what he did to his own people so he's just repeating what he knows
[02:39:31.800 --> 02:39:35.160]  you know they say you can't teach an old dog new tricks church
[02:39:35.160 --> 02:39:40.360]  oh that's absolutely true but the bottom line here alitz on this subject is
[02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:44.280]  you need to protect yourself you need to protect your family i happen to be a
[02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:47.480]  concealed weapons permit holder works well in
[02:39:47.480 --> 02:39:51.160]  missouri doesn't work for me at all in california
[02:39:51.160 --> 02:39:54.840]  but you got to protect your family and do what you have to do
[02:39:54.840 --> 02:39:58.520]  and that is something that you have been pounding away at
[02:39:58.520 --> 02:40:02.520]  for so many years and you know the the day's going to come
[02:40:02.520 --> 02:40:05.880]  whether the power grid goes out something we've been pushing as a
[02:40:05.880 --> 02:40:08.600]  campaign something that's going to happen way
[02:40:08.600 --> 02:40:11.000]  beyond the things that are happening right now
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:15.240]  and people need to be ready for it or there's going to be a calamity
[02:40:15.240 --> 02:40:19.960]  beyond anything you can imagine now i want to shift gears and talk about
[02:40:19.960 --> 02:40:23.240]  something that i know you're really an expert on you've looked at every angle
[02:40:23.240 --> 02:40:26.280]  i tune in three or four times a week when i'm staying up late
[02:40:26.280 --> 02:40:29.880]  or i listen when 5 90 a.m rears you at like eight at night now
[02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:33.000]  which is great because i used to go to bed about 10 or 11 and then get up at
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:36.520]  about 6 a.m but when i do stay up later i'm on a road trip i listen
[02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:41.240]  and or i listen to the podcast but you've written someone is hiding something
[02:40:41.240 --> 02:40:45.000]  with another great writer and researcher we're going to talk about that we're
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.160]  also going to talk about critical health news
[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:50.680]  dot com a really exciting site that you've launched
[02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:53.640]  but before we go there i want to move quickly through a bunch of different
[02:40:53.640 --> 02:40:57.880]  articles with you george you can do that let's do it my next point was this you
[02:40:57.880 --> 02:41:02.120]  just magically brought up we should all be armed before i asked it
[02:41:02.120 --> 02:41:06.200]  newsmax europe's leading rabbi let jews carry guns for protection
[02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:09.640]  well yeah they do in israel why not let everybody
[02:41:09.640 --> 02:41:13.160]  uh in europe carry a gun and then you wouldn't see stuff like this just like
[02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:17.880]  the head of interpol said last year arm people and you won't see these kenya
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:20.760]  shopping mall shootings so it does show some sanity
[02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:25.960]  it's starting to come out it's starting i mean i have always said look the
[02:41:25.960 --> 02:41:30.680]  criminals or the element that wants to get you will get a gun
[02:41:30.680 --> 02:41:36.600]  they will find the gun so the average citizen the good guy the good
[02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:40.360]  woman you know she doesn't go to some clandestine person
[02:41:40.360 --> 02:41:43.880]  to buy a handgun she'll go to a legitimate dealer give her the right
[02:41:43.880 --> 02:41:47.080]  give him the right to do that don't try to sequester them
[02:41:47.080 --> 02:41:50.680]  don't try to stop them from doing that everybody
[02:41:50.680 --> 02:41:55.560]  who is a law abiding person who doesn't have mental illness
[02:41:55.560 --> 02:42:02.680]  should be able to get a gun in this country and on this planet
[02:42:02.680 --> 02:42:06.440]  i agree a cia finds no wrongdoing an agency search
[02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:09.640]  of computers used by the senate investigators they violated the fourth
[02:42:09.640 --> 02:42:12.440]  amendment they violated the the branches of government
[02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:15.880]  now they've investigated themselves and say they did nothing i mean clearly this
[02:42:15.880 --> 02:42:19.800]  is about blackmailing congress if they can get away with this the sky's the
[02:42:19.800 --> 02:42:23.320]  limit they've gotten away with it uh not only
[02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:27.640]  with this alex but so many other things let's go back to the jfk
[02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:31.800]  assassination the cia understood they were they knew
[02:42:31.800 --> 02:42:35.160]  about it uh they may have had some people as part of it
[02:42:35.160 --> 02:42:40.440]  uh they tried to do in fidel kastrow uh they have had their hands on everything
[02:42:40.440 --> 02:42:42.680]  look we need a great intelligence service
[02:42:42.680 --> 02:42:46.120]  or a country and there are other countries out there that hate us
[02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:51.240]  we need to have great intelligence but man don't turn yourselves on us
[02:42:51.240 --> 02:42:55.480]  we're the we're the good people you know do what you're gonna do with the
[02:42:55.480 --> 02:43:01.240]  former kgb folks and stuff like that but don't spy on americans or or do what
[02:43:01.240 --> 02:43:06.280]  you have to do to congress and uh it it's it's despicable
[02:43:06.280 --> 02:43:09.320]  and it's totally illegal this is what third world countries do they end up
[02:43:09.320 --> 02:43:11.720]  having their intelligence service take over
[02:43:11.720 --> 02:43:16.040]  and this is what seizer did with his legions 2040 something years ago i mean
[02:43:16.040 --> 02:43:19.240]  we know where this goes
[02:43:19.560 --> 02:43:23.480]  another story now sorry go ahead no no go ahead
[02:43:23.480 --> 02:43:26.840]  i was going to simply round it up by saying that
[02:43:26.840 --> 02:43:30.680]  they have this feeling as if they're gods
[02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:35.320]  and that there's nothing that anyone can do to stop
[02:43:35.320 --> 02:43:39.080]  that's what it comes down to in the final equation another story what do you
[02:43:39.080 --> 02:43:43.640]  think's going on here with the purges of the military brass the purges of the
[02:43:43.640 --> 02:43:48.520]  navy seals and army special operations the purges now of secret
[02:43:48.520 --> 02:43:52.200]  service people that's really creepy as well
[02:43:52.200 --> 02:43:55.720]  that is creepy you know is there incompetence where some of these people
[02:43:55.720 --> 02:43:59.800]  need to be let go maybe maybe but i think there's a
[02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:04.120]  different agenda afoot here i haven't put my finger on it yet
[02:44:04.120 --> 02:44:08.600]  because they do seem to be ousting some pretty darn good people
[02:44:08.600 --> 02:44:12.520]  and you know it takes years to train great navy seals
[02:44:12.520 --> 02:44:16.120]  and a good secret service agent there's something going on here there's
[02:44:16.120 --> 02:44:19.320]  something well it's like they need to get them out of the picture for some
[02:44:19.320 --> 02:44:22.360]  reason well dan bonjino was the head guy on foreign
[02:44:22.360 --> 02:44:25.800]  detail so he was you know really being promoted up towards the very top of the
[02:44:25.800 --> 02:44:29.240]  organization he was already near the top and he said look i can't violate my
[02:44:29.240 --> 02:44:32.200]  confidence i've signed the agreements but he said here repeatedly he said
[02:44:32.200 --> 02:44:36.680]  it's so incredible you wouldn't believe it well we know from fbi agents that
[02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:38.680]  work in the white house and others the kind of stuff that was going on with
[02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:43.480]  hillary and i mean it's just these people
[02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:48.200]  it is so scary and then you see patreus who as a general did some pretty good
[02:44:48.200 --> 02:44:50.360]  operations i'm not defending these wars but
[02:44:50.360 --> 02:44:54.040]  was a pretty good general had a lot of i mean i'm not endorsing him but compared
[02:44:54.040 --> 02:44:56.920]  to a lot of people because he had a girlfriend
[02:44:56.920 --> 02:45:00.440]  they're looking at indicting him and holder who ran fast and furious and did
[02:45:00.440 --> 02:45:03.560]  all this how can holder with the irs targeting
[02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:07.560]  christians and veterans and all this why is he still there he was supposed to be
[02:45:07.560 --> 02:45:11.880]  gone six months ago so i mean so there's clearly a purge going on
[02:45:11.880 --> 02:45:15.960]  be careful but you'll tell your good friend in bed
[02:45:15.960 --> 02:45:20.600]  exactly yeah what i mean but
[02:45:20.600 --> 02:45:24.200]  they're gonna indict a general over a girlfriend i mean this is insane
[02:45:24.200 --> 02:45:28.760]  i know it i know and it's not like she ran to other countries with her trade
[02:45:28.760 --> 02:45:33.240]  secrets jeez i mean are you gonna indict someone who
[02:45:33.240 --> 02:45:37.160]  tells his wife somebody who's working for government
[02:45:37.160 --> 02:45:41.320]  and assigned a confidentiality and a nondisclosure and everything else do you
[02:45:41.320 --> 02:45:43.640]  get a top secret clearance you're gonna tell
[02:45:43.640 --> 02:45:47.160]  your wife and then you're gonna indict the guy for doing that
[02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:51.640]  it's the same thing meanwhile well i could just rant about it all day let's
[02:45:51.640 --> 02:45:57.000]  talk about your new book something or someone is hiding something
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:00.760]  and folks can also go to see your tv show at beyondbelief.com
[02:46:00.760 --> 02:46:06.600]  coast2coastam.com let's talk about someone is hiding something the new book
[02:46:06.600 --> 02:46:11.320]  this is exciting alex so richard belzer who played
[02:46:11.320 --> 02:46:15.960]  munch in law and order and you know him quite well
[02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:20.680]  he of course has written books on jfk
[02:46:20.680 --> 02:46:25.160]  in our co-author is david wane who's just amazing
[02:46:25.160 --> 02:46:29.640]  they were working on this book the malaysian airline man
[02:46:29.640 --> 02:46:33.960]  370 flight that disappeared on march 8th of last year
[02:46:33.960 --> 02:46:38.120]  and they came to me and said look we're looking for someone to write
[02:46:38.120 --> 02:46:42.120]  additional chapters of things that may have happened
[02:46:42.120 --> 02:46:46.120]  we've got our ideas here they are can you add a few
[02:46:46.120 --> 02:46:49.960]  and i went yeah okay so they brought me in as a third partner
[02:46:49.960 --> 02:46:53.240]  in the book someone is hiding something which comes out in a month
[02:46:53.240 --> 02:46:58.920]  it's available right now on amazon.com uh they're taking pre-orders it's amazing
[02:46:58.920 --> 02:47:03.240]  how they discount that but it's just an amazing story
[02:47:03.240 --> 02:47:10.120]  of how this huge Boeing 777 with with hundreds of people on board
[02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:14.680]  just disappeared and then now we've had two other disasters
[02:47:14.680 --> 02:47:17.800]  that they went over ukraine and the other plane coming out of their missing
[02:47:17.800 --> 02:47:20.680]  in your gut what do you think's going on or talk about some of the theories
[02:47:20.680 --> 02:47:23.160]  they're in the book well some of the theories are the
[02:47:23.160 --> 02:47:29.160]  standard ones pilot suicide hijacking um and again i'm not
[02:47:29.160 --> 02:47:32.840]  going to say this is the one or this isn't but uh
[02:47:32.840 --> 02:47:35.400]  Diego Garcia a lot of folks think it was diverted there
[02:47:35.400 --> 02:47:41.000]  Diego Garcia shot down by governments um a UFO gobbled them up as
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:45.080]  preposterous as that may sound going through a portal a time warp
[02:47:45.080 --> 02:47:49.320]  so there's a lot of different a brand new weapon that was tested
[02:47:49.320 --> 02:47:53.640]  and hit that plane there so there's a lot of different scenarios what is
[02:47:53.640 --> 02:47:58.680]  fascinating about this story is look how fast they found the asia flight their
[02:47:58.680 --> 02:48:02.920]  asia flight uh they just found the fuselage yesterday with sadly
[02:48:02.920 --> 02:48:06.040]  bodies inside they're going to try to raise that
[02:48:06.040 --> 02:48:09.720]  they can't find this thing which flew for hours
[02:48:09.720 --> 02:48:14.520]  all over that area hundreds and hundreds of miles
[02:48:14.520 --> 02:48:19.640]  um it's an amazingly bizarre story so we put it all together and
[02:48:19.640 --> 02:48:24.280]  someone is hiding something uh and that quote by the way
[02:48:24.280 --> 02:48:29.960]  came from former government officials uh in Indonesia and Malaysia
[02:48:29.960 --> 02:48:33.800]  they're the ones who said that they're baffled by this everybody's baffled
[02:48:33.800 --> 02:48:36.440]  by it well then the similar plane same-making model
[02:48:36.440 --> 02:48:40.600]  gets shot down over ukraine that was a sister plane it was made during the
[02:48:40.600 --> 02:48:45.560]  same time that's bizarre you know i say there are no coincidences
[02:48:45.560 --> 02:48:49.400]  uh that went down and then this one sadly goes down but
[02:48:49.400 --> 02:48:52.680]  i you know i i'm very curious when they really analyze
[02:48:52.680 --> 02:48:58.520]  the cockpit recorders the black boxes what they may pick up but can you
[02:48:58.520 --> 02:49:02.280]  imagine you know both of us being in radio listening to audio
[02:49:02.280 --> 02:49:07.400]  i would love in in a non-statistic way to hear those two copilot
[02:49:07.400 --> 02:49:11.800]  the pilot and the copilot on on on tape what they're saying
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:16.120]  while this is going down well it's it's it's wild what's happening speaking of
[02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:20.120]  that we're about to go to break um and i've got a few final points i want to
[02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:23.400]  get into you uh with george norrie here today but
[02:49:23.400 --> 02:49:26.840]  what else is on your radar speaking of aviation what else
[02:49:26.840 --> 02:49:30.040]  right now is something you're watching
[02:49:30.040 --> 02:49:34.520]  well we're just uh watching everything unfold we're watching things going on in
[02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:38.440]  space we're watching now world events that affect all of us and
[02:49:38.440 --> 02:49:42.520]  what you said was absolutely right alex i've tweaked the show since i came in
[02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:47.960]  you know coast to coast was the just paranormal show uh years ago
[02:49:47.960 --> 02:49:52.520]  and we have added now we're up to 600 affiliates from 440
[02:49:52.520 --> 02:49:57.400]  um but the programming we still do the fun stuff and the entertaining stuff
[02:49:57.400 --> 02:50:01.160]  uh and the paranormal stuff believe me that's a staple of the program
[02:50:01.160 --> 02:50:07.240]  but we are now doing alex jones investigation type radio
[02:50:07.240 --> 02:50:11.480]  uh because these events affect all of us and and for us not to
[02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:15.320]  would be irresponsible the program's too big
[02:50:15.320 --> 02:50:19.000]  not to look at that sure but i'll tell you when i'm driving through the
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:23.400]  mountains at midnight in colorata and you guys have got guests on about
[02:50:23.400 --> 02:50:27.160]  vampire stories and vampire hitchhikers i'm looking back over my

[02:50:34.440 --> 02:50:38.680]  real george soros kind of resembles a shadow rodent
[02:50:38.680 --> 02:50:42.280]  i'm sorry hillary actually i don't want to steal the title

[02:56:14.600 --> 02:56:17.960]  is a little more dangerous than gorbachev was at the time
