[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]  InfoWars. Tomorrow's news. Today.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:56.160]  It's Thursday, July 13th, 2023. And I am your host, Alex Jones. Wow. Huh. Crazy developments.
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.320]  The gloves are off with the pedo-Satanist. California tried to pass a bill to make it
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.480]  a felony to be caught sex-trafficking children. The Democrats unanimously voted it down and
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:16.520]  then laughed at the victims as they cried. Actual video of the evil uncloaking itself.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:25.640]  Speaking of evil, the poor little victim, Ray Epps, has filed a lawsuit against Fox
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.200]  for saying that he instigated by saying, go into the Capitol and then saying that
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:40.920]  he quote, orchestrated the attack with his text messages. He said to family, I just orchestrated
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.560]  it. Well, you're not allowed to say that. So they'll get a pick jury in DC totally controlled
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.360]  and probably give $8 billion or something to Ray Epps. But Ray Epps to be criminally
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.480]  charged for events on January 6th. His attorney says Trump's supporter. Yeah, right. Ray Epps
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:07.720]  sues Fox news editor Carlson baselessly called him a Jan six instigator. Okay. And Wiley coyote
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.920]  doesn't go after the roadrunner. Okay. A Trump supporter. Ray Epps sues Fox news for defamation
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.160]  over January six falsehoods. But in the lawsuit, they say he's been told that his criminal
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.960]  charging is imminent, but that's from his lawyers. I mean, who knows what's true, but
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.520]  Ray Christopher Ray, the FBI director got smashed yesterday repeatedly on the subject
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:38.280]  that's coming up. So we have what the F California assembly Democrats block bill to make child
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.240]  trafficking a crime. And then they laugh about it. I mean, it's just, these people
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.520]  are next level. And I've got a whole stack of news where California is becoming the pedophile
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:57.160]  utopia. Then of course the biggest news here is the war effort is in shambles as Hawks turn on
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:04.240]  each other at NATO summit. They're now preparing to blame Zelensky for the failure of NATO to defeat
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:12.200]  Russia. And so the knives are out for Zelensky in a big, big way. Key stack on that big new
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.160]  developments on the central bank, digital currencies, and the entire control grid rolling
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:24.800]  out. Uh, we also have some of the ties into all the pedo information leftist everywhere in court
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:32.000]  rulings and in statements and in Disney programs, Disney movies are saying murder of children is
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.840]  their religious sacrament under the first amendment. And they're right. Pure evil, latest
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.040]  production cartoon about a girl who inherits a ritualistic killing blood drinking cult from her
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:51.200]  father. Then satanic temple lawsuit claiming Texas law violates the religious freedom to murder
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.120]  children dismissed by federal judge. Oh, too bad. And then this one hellish Democrat freak fantasizes
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:05.960]  about being first tranny to implant uterus and abort baby for their religious sacrament. It's
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:16.120]  all coming up today. That's just four of the stacks. Then we've got more articles saying that
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:24.320]  if you're in shape, you are a white supremacist, EU commissioner, fairy Britain, Warren social
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.880]  media companies that if they don't engage in total censorship, they'll be criminally charged. So
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:35.640]  that's the EU weighing in on our free speech. We got good news federal judge again, backing other
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.960]  federal judges. ruling is illegal what the Biden administration really the Obama administration has
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.520]  been doing on the surveillance and censorship going on. That's only the tip of the iceberg. Big

[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:43.360]  Thank you for joining us my friends on this live teleprompter free Thursday, July 13. Worldwide
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:51.080]  broadcast. I'm your host Alex Jones. Dr. Rima Labo, whose husband was the head of the army, and
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.040]  the head of secret operations at another time, is really one of the top experts on the New World
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.360]  Order. She's got huge developments concerning the UN takeover of global healthcare and more. She
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.960]  joins us in an hour and a half from now, the balance of the broadcast, but we will again open
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.440]  the phones up today. We will again cover the waterfront of incredible breaking news. Well, the
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:24.280]  Russians are decisively winning in Ukraine. They are decisively crushing Zelensky. And so now NATO
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:30.800]  is preparing to trash and blame Elensky for that. And that's what's currently happening. So we're
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:36.160]  going to be hitting that first. But let's go ahead and look at some clips here. See, listen to some
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:43.440]  clips here of Biden. And folks, we have hours of these, we would fill the entire show with gaffes. We
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:51.600]  are not excising small cutlets out of his buffoonery and out of his public meltdown. We're just showing
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:59.760]  you a small sample. His entire speech in between the World War Three warmongering was absolutely
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:05.320]  incoherent dribble, which is humiliating for our republic. But here's Biden saying Russia could end
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:12.880]  this war tomorrow by ceasing its inhumane attacks on Russia. One country cannot be allowed to seize
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:18.760]  its neighbor's territory by force. Russia could end this war tomorrow by withdrawing its forces
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:25.800]  in Ukraine, wrecking its international borders and ceasing its attacks on its inhumane attacks
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.160]  on Russia. I mean, spy Russia on Ukraine.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:38.120]  So there you go. And the truth is, Ukraine is the birthplace of Russia. But it's where Russia for
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:44.840]  1000 years has fought Muslims, and then fought Catholics. And I'm not an Orthodox, I'm not a
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:50.600]  Catholic. I love both sides. They're all Christians are good people. But it was the battleground in
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:58.360]  Hitler's Germany, and in World War Two, and it the West has exacerbated the splits between Western
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:03.640]  Ukraine and Eastern Ukraine. Eastern Ukraine is as Russia as New York City is American.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:13.480]  So the US started this whole thing. And there's the Freudian slip by Biden, saying that Russia
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:19.720]  needs to stop attacking Russia. Well, if the chai comms took over Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi,
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:26.520]  we'd be down there fighting them too. And of course, the chai comms would try to claim Well,
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:31.480]  there's an ethnic minority of Hispanics that say they're Mexican, not American. So we're here for
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:38.600]  them. That's basically what NATO is doing is they're using that excuse of the Aryan Ukrainian
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:44.280]  minority. And it's a big minority 3040% who do not see themselves as Slavic, they see themselves as
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:49.560]  German. And that's why Hitler annexed part of Ukraine in World War Two. So that battle's been
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:54.840]  going on for at least 400 years in Ukraine between Europeans. Before that it was with Muslims
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:00.920]  routinely invading. But if you think that's a ridiculous clip, here is Henry Kissinger getting
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:08.600]  a call from those famous Russian pranksters that get into they've pranked Nancy Pelosi,
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:15.400]  and they they've pranked basically all the top people. You think of them, they've pranked them.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:22.600]  They got through on the Skype or the zoom of Henry Kissinger and posed as the dictator
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.920]  of Ukraine Zelensky here is an off North Stream to
[00:10:29.052 --> 00:10:46.852]  How do you think, who is behind, who is behind the explosion of North Stream 2?
[00:10:46.852 --> 00:10:47.852]  Who is guilty?
[00:10:47.852 --> 00:10:48.852]  How do you think?
[00:10:48.852 --> 00:10:51.852]  I frankly thought you were.
[00:10:51.852 --> 00:10:52.852]  Really?
[00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:53.852]  You think that we?
[00:10:53.852 --> 00:10:54.852]  No, no.
[00:10:55.852 --> 00:11:02.852]  But I didn't blame you.
[00:11:02.852 --> 00:11:04.852]  I love how there's David Rockefeller behind it.
[00:11:04.852 --> 00:11:06.852]  I would not say that as a criticism.
[00:11:06.852 --> 00:11:08.852]  It's so real.
[00:11:08.852 --> 00:11:10.852]  And Nelson Rockefeller.
[00:11:10.852 --> 00:11:12.852]  Hey, back that up guys.
[00:11:12.852 --> 00:11:18.852]  Nelson Rockefeller is in the middle on the right hand side and above that is a shot with David and some other people.
[00:11:18.852 --> 00:11:21.852]  So that's the patrons of him is the Rockefellers.
[00:11:21.852 --> 00:11:24.852]  There's New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller right there.
[00:11:24.852 --> 00:11:31.852]  The other, the lady over on the side, that's Roosevelt's wife, the communist.
[00:11:31.852 --> 00:11:34.852]  Please get it off the screen before I throw up.
[00:11:34.852 --> 00:11:38.852]  So, see I'm a weirdo.
[00:11:38.852 --> 00:11:40.852]  I'm into history so I know who these people are.
[00:11:40.852 --> 00:11:42.852]  That's why I know what's going to happen next.
[00:11:42.852 --> 00:11:43.852]  I study all these people.
[00:11:43.852 --> 00:11:47.852]  Most people study football and all their favorite football players and basketball players.
[00:11:47.852 --> 00:11:48.852]  I'm sorry.
[00:11:48.852 --> 00:11:51.852]  I do not study the jock size of LeBron James.
[00:11:51.852 --> 00:11:55.852]  I study the enemies of freedom and what they're up to because I want to stop them.
[00:11:55.852 --> 00:11:57.852]  Nothing against the fact people love sports.
[00:11:57.852 --> 00:12:02.852]  I'm just saying I know the baseball cards, the bad guys, not the baseball cards that don't matter.
[00:12:02.852 --> 00:12:05.852]  So continuing, let's hear some more babble from Biden.
[00:12:05.852 --> 00:12:08.852]  Here's Biden versus a teleprompter.
[00:12:08.852 --> 00:12:19.852]  Soon NATO will be the 32nd freestanding, have free, 30 free, 32 freestanding members,
[00:12:19.852 --> 00:12:23.852]  standing together to defend our people and our territory.
[00:12:23.852 --> 00:12:29.852]  Now here's Biden saying that, well, we hear Zelensky hasn't been too happy putting out these tweets
[00:12:29.852 --> 00:12:33.852]  that NATO's abandoned him and NATO's weak and he wants full war.
[00:12:33.852 --> 00:12:37.852]  He wants NATO to, he's already fired missiles into Poland trying to get World War III going.
[00:12:37.852 --> 00:12:40.852]  He knows the Russians have said we invaded because you plan to join NATO.
[00:12:40.852 --> 00:12:42.852]  They went, oh, no, we're not joining NATO.
[00:12:42.852 --> 00:12:45.852]  Then, of course, you're trying to join NATO right now.
[00:12:45.852 --> 00:12:51.852]  And so here's Biden saying, oh, Ukrainian President Zelensky seemed very satisfied
[00:12:51.852 --> 00:12:54.852]  with everything we've been doing when we left.
[00:12:54.852 --> 00:12:55.852]  Here it is.
[00:12:55.852 --> 00:12:58.852]  They already have the equivalent of attackers now.
[00:12:58.852 --> 00:13:02.852]  What we need most of all is artillery shells.
[00:13:02.852 --> 00:13:04.852]  And they're in short supply.
[00:13:04.852 --> 00:13:06.852]  We're working on that.
[00:13:06.852 --> 00:13:13.852]  And so he seems very, very satisfied with everything we're doing when we left.
[00:13:13.852 --> 00:13:17.852]  OK, so let's boil down why this is happening.
[00:13:17.852 --> 00:13:23.852]  The Russians from the beginning said they just want 25 percent of Ukraine
[00:13:23.852 --> 00:13:28.852]  that has rivers and some hills that give them some defense against NATO
[00:13:28.852 --> 00:13:33.852]  and that they want their industrial base that is in the east of Ukraine
[00:13:33.852 --> 00:13:36.852]  that the Russians built after it was all destroyed at the end of World War II.
[00:13:36.852 --> 00:13:42.852]  And they want the Black Sea fleet base they have in Crimea.
[00:13:42.852 --> 00:13:44.852]  And so that's been their plan from the beginning.
[00:13:44.852 --> 00:13:47.852]  Putin said five years ago, if you keep building up troops,
[00:13:47.852 --> 00:13:49.852]  if you keep attacking Russian-controlled areas,
[00:13:49.852 --> 00:13:53.852]  we're going to launch a military operation to clean them out.
[00:13:53.852 --> 00:13:54.852]  They didn't stop.
[00:13:54.852 --> 00:13:55.852]  Putin went in.
[00:13:55.852 --> 00:13:57.852]  It endangers World War III.
[00:13:57.852 --> 00:13:59.852]  The rest is history.
[00:13:59.852 --> 00:14:01.852]  It's very, very serious.
[00:14:01.852 --> 00:14:03.852]  The Russians have secured that area.
[00:14:03.852 --> 00:14:05.852]  The counteroffensive has been completely destroyed.
[00:14:05.852 --> 00:14:11.852]  And so now NATO wants to make a deal with Putin and wind this down.
[00:14:11.852 --> 00:14:17.852]  Or they want Zelensky to just continue to put Ukrainians into a meat grinder forever
[00:14:17.852 --> 00:14:21.852]  and build a bunch of permanent munitions factories in Poland
[00:14:21.852 --> 00:14:26.852]  to then militarize that entire area and continue to launder money.
[00:14:26.852 --> 00:14:28.852]  And Zelensky is playing right along with it.
[00:14:28.852 --> 00:14:31.852]  But he will not allow some of the groups that want to end this to do that.
[00:14:31.852 --> 00:14:36.852]  So he's playing right into the idea of just basically sacrificing
[00:14:36.852 --> 00:14:40.852]  hundreds of thousands more conservatively Ukrainians to die, including Russians.
[00:14:40.852 --> 00:14:44.852]  So it's absolutely evil, started by Soros, started by the State Department,
[00:14:44.852 --> 00:14:48.852]  started by the West, needs to stop.
[00:14:48.852 --> 00:14:57.852]  And these guys are really right now eyeing where they want to go with this.
[00:14:57.852 --> 00:15:02.852]  Is NATO going to escalate with Russia and further threaten nuclear war?
[00:15:02.852 --> 00:15:07.852]  Or is NATO going to make Zelensky sue for peace,
[00:15:07.852 --> 00:15:13.852]  and then Russia gets 25 percent of Ukraine, and this whole thing stops?
[00:15:13.852 --> 00:15:17.852]  And that's basically where the world is right now.
[00:15:17.852 --> 00:15:24.852]  Putin is being empowered by this, not weakened.
[00:15:24.852 --> 00:15:35.852]  The bizarre Purgojan work, Purgojan, you see Europe in fire with the Islamic uprising
[00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:38.852]  and those uprisings spreading.
[00:15:38.852 --> 00:15:41.852]  And so right now the globalists know they're losing.
[00:15:41.852 --> 00:15:43.852]  Russia and BRICS is becoming stronger.
[00:15:43.852 --> 00:15:47.852]  Russia is making record amounts of money through oil export.
[00:15:47.852 --> 00:15:50.852]  The West is getting weaker and weaker.
[00:15:50.852 --> 00:15:54.852]  It's hurting the dollars hegemony.
[00:15:54.852 --> 00:15:58.852]  So this is a very, very important moment where the world is right now.
[00:15:58.852 --> 00:16:03.852]  And again, we have the neocons, we have the warmongers, we have the crazies
[00:16:03.852 --> 00:16:07.852]  that can't see the writing on the wall that Russia is fundamentally winning this
[00:16:07.852 --> 00:16:13.852]  and will win this and has not been baited into a wider war so far,
[00:16:13.852 --> 00:16:18.852]  and that if you don't then send in regular NATO troops,
[00:16:18.852 --> 00:16:20.852]  Ukraine is already lost.
[00:16:20.852 --> 00:16:25.852]  But even if you send in NATO troops, then Russia goes to full mobilization
[00:16:25.852 --> 00:16:29.852]  and that invariably leads to tactical and then regional
[00:16:29.852 --> 00:16:34.852]  and then worldwide commitment into nuclear war.
[00:16:34.852 --> 00:16:36.852]  So let's look at some of these headlines.
[00:16:36.852 --> 00:16:42.852]  War effort in shambles as hawks turn on each other at NATO summit.
[00:16:42.852 --> 00:16:48.852]  The war in Ukraine shifts decisively in Russia's favor.
[00:16:48.852 --> 00:16:51.852]  Viktor Orban helps prevent World War III.
[00:16:51.852 --> 00:16:54.852]  We should bring peace instead of weapons to Ukraine.
[00:16:54.852 --> 00:16:57.852]  And look at the photo, and I've watched the actual video.
[00:16:57.852 --> 00:16:59.852]  This is not taken out of context.
[00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:01.852]  Here is Zelensky in his little costume.
[00:17:01.852 --> 00:17:04.852]  He wasn't told this wasn't a costume party.
[00:17:04.852 --> 00:17:08.852]  And they just ignored him up in the big photo shoot they did for five minutes
[00:17:08.852 --> 00:17:12.852]  where they all get together in their own little cliques.
[00:17:12.852 --> 00:17:16.852]  And this sends a message of who's with who and who's in what globalist clique.
[00:17:16.852 --> 00:17:22.852]  It's all the same cult but different arms of it, different tentacles of it.
[00:17:22.852 --> 00:17:30.852]  And they all want him to know he's the uncool kid over at the table by himself.
[00:17:30.852 --> 00:17:33.852]  And this is because he talked out of hand.
[00:17:33.852 --> 00:17:36.852]  He tried to blame NATO for the loss.
[00:17:36.852 --> 00:17:38.852]  And they're like, no, no, no, no, Zelensky.
[00:17:38.852 --> 00:17:44.852]  You are the gay pornographic actor that we have blackmailed.
[00:17:44.852 --> 00:17:46.852]  You're the guy we're going to burn when you fail.
[00:17:46.852 --> 00:17:49.852]  You're the guy we're going to set up.
[00:17:49.852 --> 00:17:54.852]  It's like Saddam Hussein was used to attack Iran and a hero in the U.S. media for seven years.
[00:17:54.852 --> 00:17:59.852]  Look how it ended for him after he served his usefulness.
[00:17:59.852 --> 00:18:04.852]  So he's a total puppet, a total actor being set up, now being shown,
[00:18:04.852 --> 00:18:07.852]  hey, little man, you don't actually run anything.
[00:18:07.852 --> 00:18:13.852]  You are just a miserable little puppet.
[00:18:13.852 --> 00:18:17.852]  U.S. delegation furious over Zelensky's tweet.
[00:18:17.852 --> 00:18:20.852]  U.K. defense minister says what everyone is thinking.
[00:18:20.852 --> 00:18:23.852]  We are not an Amazon delivery service for weapons to Ukraine.
[00:18:23.852 --> 00:18:27.852]  Notice how British intelligence has been involved more than anybody
[00:18:27.852 --> 00:18:32.852]  except the U.S. State Department and the CIA, stirring this up, overthrowing elected governments,
[00:18:32.852 --> 00:18:36.852]  launching this war, encouraging the most high-tech weapons to go.
[00:18:36.852 --> 00:18:40.852]  And now that all this failed and the Russians have won decisive victories
[00:18:40.852 --> 00:18:46.852]  and destroyed roughly half of all the new equipment in just a few weeks sent to the front line,
[00:18:46.852 --> 00:18:54.852]  now the British government turns on their moron puppet in his little military dictator outfit,
[00:18:54.852 --> 00:18:58.852]  his little Fidel Castro outfit, his little Kim Jong-un outfit,
[00:18:58.852 --> 00:19:03.851]  his little Kim Jong-il outfit, his little Stalin outfit, his little Hitler outfit.
[00:19:03.851 --> 00:19:09.851]  And now the British government that helped quarterback and blueprint
[00:19:09.851 --> 00:19:12.851]  and run the whole thing actually commanded it.
[00:19:12.851 --> 00:19:17.851]  Now they say, who do you think you are demanding weapons from us?
[00:19:17.851 --> 00:19:20.851]  We just run your intel operation and tell you what to do.
[00:19:20.851 --> 00:19:24.851]  And now they're getting in position to fall.
[00:19:24.851 --> 00:19:27.851]  They've made their hundreds and hundreds of billions of weapons.
[00:19:27.851 --> 00:19:29.851]  They've smuggled out the kids.
[00:19:29.851 --> 00:19:31.851]  They've harvested the organs.
[00:19:31.851 --> 00:19:34.851]  They've killed hundreds of thousands of Russians.
[00:19:34.851 --> 00:19:36.851]  They've destabilized the planet.
[00:19:36.851 --> 00:19:40.851]  They've shifted out of the COVID narrative power grab into this new COVID power grab.
[00:19:40.851 --> 00:19:44.851]  Now it's the confrontation with China is the next phase and power outages are domestically
[00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:46.851]  and race war and civil war.
[00:19:46.851 --> 00:19:47.851]  Now, don't worry.
[00:19:47.851 --> 00:19:48.851]  They got new crises ready.
[00:19:48.851 --> 00:19:53.851]  But since the Russians are winning, they're going to end this current thing
[00:19:53.851 --> 00:19:55.851]  and move on to the next current thing.
[00:19:55.851 --> 00:19:57.851]  At least they're thinking about it.
[00:19:57.851 --> 00:20:01.851]  And they want Zelensky to know if we decide to roll over to Putin,
[00:20:01.851 --> 00:20:08.851]  you better do everything we tell you or you're going to end up dying in a helicopter accident
[00:20:08.851 --> 00:20:11.851]  or you're going to die of a heart attack, buddy boy.
[00:20:11.851 --> 00:20:15.851]  It'll come out you died of cocaine overdose because you're not a real leader.
[00:20:15.851 --> 00:20:16.851]  You are a dictator.
[00:20:16.851 --> 00:20:18.851]  You've arrested your entire political opposition.
[00:20:18.851 --> 00:20:21.851]  You work with Nazi Azov battalions.
[00:20:21.851 --> 00:20:25.851]  You've banned all the major political opposition and arrested the heads of the Orthodox Church.
[00:20:25.851 --> 00:20:27.851]  No one's going along with you.
[00:20:27.851 --> 00:20:31.851]  Opposition is forming to this agenda worldwide, and we're getting ready to blame you
[00:20:31.851 --> 00:20:37.851]  for everything we trained you as a sex operative of the CIA to do.
[00:20:37.851 --> 00:20:42.851]  Because that's what Zelensky did was go into hotel rooms with Western diplomats
[00:20:42.851 --> 00:20:45.851]  and other diplomats and have sex with men to set them up.
[00:20:45.851 --> 00:20:48.851]  My intel has come in on.
[00:20:48.851 --> 00:20:50.851]  He doesn't just play the piano with his penis.
[00:20:50.851 --> 00:20:54.851]  He doesn't just wear high heels and leather outfits and grab men's butts on TV.
[00:20:54.851 --> 00:20:57.851]  He's just like Arnold Schwarzenegger and all the rest of their puppets.
[00:20:57.851 --> 00:21:03.851]  He's a homosexual sex operative.
[00:21:03.851 --> 00:21:08.851]  Just like Macron, just like half these guys.
[00:21:08.851 --> 00:21:12.851]  It's all Jeffrey Epstein crap over and over and over,
[00:21:12.851 --> 00:21:19.851]  and he started believing in his Napoleon complex that he was really God.
[00:21:19.851 --> 00:21:24.851]  They're the ones peeing on each other in hotel rooms, not Trump.
[00:21:24.851 --> 00:21:28.851]  Trump's playing golf.
[00:21:28.851 --> 00:21:32.851]  I'm hiking up mountains.
[00:21:32.851 --> 00:21:34.851]  Never get sick of it.
[00:21:34.851 --> 00:21:37.851]  You guys are doing something completely different.
[00:21:37.851 --> 00:21:40.851]  So UK defense minister says what everybody is thinking.
[00:21:40.851 --> 00:21:47.851]  We are not an Amazon delivery service for weapons to Ukraine.
[00:21:47.851 --> 00:21:48.851]  Here's Zelensky.
[00:21:48.851 --> 00:21:56.851]  After the war, Ukraine will be in NATO.
[00:21:56.851 --> 00:22:03.851]  Bubbling Joe Biden embarrasses U.S. on world stage once again with incoherent NATO speech.
[00:22:03.851 --> 00:22:06.851]  Got to love Henry Kissinger.
[00:22:06.851 --> 00:22:08.851]  He thinks he's actually talking to Zelensky.
[00:22:08.851 --> 00:22:12.851]  Those guys are perfect doing American accents, English accents.
[00:22:12.851 --> 00:22:13.851]  It sounds just like Zelensky.
[00:22:13.851 --> 00:22:16.851]  What are you saying to me?
[00:22:16.851 --> 00:22:19.851]  U.S. bombing of the Nord Stream.
[00:22:19.851 --> 00:22:24.851]  And obviously Kissinger knows it was the West for him, the U.S. Navy.
[00:22:24.851 --> 00:22:30.851]  I mean, it is you.
[00:22:30.851 --> 00:22:33.851]  But I did not blame you.
[00:22:33.851 --> 00:22:39.851]  Why you be so mean to me?
[00:22:39.851 --> 00:22:43.851]  Can we get the Emperor Skeksis death scene, please, ready?
[00:22:44.851 --> 00:22:49.851]  Because I got to tell you, if you put a Skeksis head on Kissinger or his wife,
[00:22:49.851 --> 00:22:51.851]  you would have an actual Skeksis.
[00:22:51.851 --> 00:22:53.851]  Let's roll the pranksters.
[00:22:53.851 --> 00:22:56.851]  This is, I think, their most epic prank yet.
[00:22:56.851 --> 00:22:59.851]  Let's go ahead and roll Kissinger getting pranked.
[00:22:59.851 --> 00:23:08.851]  Nord Stream 2.
[00:23:08.851 --> 00:23:09.851]  How do you think?
[00:23:09.851 --> 00:23:19.851]  Who is behind the explosion of Nord Stream 2?
[00:23:19.851 --> 00:23:20.851]  Who is guilty?
[00:23:20.851 --> 00:23:21.851]  How do you think?
[00:23:21.851 --> 00:23:24.851]  I frankly thought you were.
[00:23:24.851 --> 00:23:25.851]  Really?
[00:23:25.851 --> 00:23:27.851]  You think that we?
[00:23:27.851 --> 00:23:29.851]  No, no.
[00:23:29.851 --> 00:23:37.851]  But I didn't blame you.
[00:23:37.851 --> 00:23:40.851]  I would not say that as a criticism.
[00:23:40.851 --> 00:23:43.851]  It is so real.
[00:24:07.851 --> 00:24:10.851]  What is their system collapsing in front of us right now?
[00:24:10.851 --> 00:24:32.851]  Start the clip over, please.
[00:24:32.851 --> 00:24:41.851]  I hate your whimper.
[00:24:41.851 --> 00:24:43.851]  Inside the US Senate?
[00:24:44.851 --> 00:24:58.851]  Literally.
[00:24:59.851 --> 00:25:07.851]  Come here.
[00:25:07.851 --> 00:25:15.851]  She is not dead yet, my Lord Chamberlain.
[00:25:15.851 --> 00:25:25.851]  Kneel.
[00:25:25.851 --> 00:25:54.851]  Kneel.
[00:25:54.851 --> 00:26:00.851]  That was like 100 bytes.
[00:26:01.851 --> 00:26:25.851]  Kneel.
[00:26:25.851 --> 00:26:27.851]  I've had enough fun, but it's actually not fun
[00:26:27.851 --> 00:26:30.851]  because these people are collapsing on top of us.
[00:26:30.851 --> 00:26:33.851]  So I've covered what's going on with the war.
[00:26:33.851 --> 00:26:35.851]  It's huge.
[00:26:35.851 --> 00:26:37.851]  I'm not a Russophobe.
[00:26:37.851 --> 00:26:39.851]  I'm not a Russophile.
[00:26:39.851 --> 00:26:41.851]  I have studied the history of it quite a bit.
[00:26:41.851 --> 00:26:43.851]  It's very fascinating.
[00:26:43.851 --> 00:26:46.851]  The West did start this.
[00:26:46.851 --> 00:26:50.851]  The West has basically been funding the communist system the whole time,
[00:26:50.851 --> 00:26:53.851]  and as you can see is setting it up now here.
[00:26:53.851 --> 00:26:58.851]  Russia is opposing it to many facets and areas,
[00:26:58.851 --> 00:27:00.851]  but really not completely,
[00:27:00.851 --> 00:27:03.851]  and is just as leftist and shot up and infiltrated as we are.
[00:27:03.851 --> 00:27:05.851]  So Russia is not going to save us.
[00:27:05.851 --> 00:27:07.851]  The US isn't going to save us.
[00:27:07.851 --> 00:27:10.851]  God is going to save us in our personal relationship with God.
[00:27:10.851 --> 00:27:12.851]  That said, the globalists bragged.
[00:27:12.851 --> 00:27:13.851]  They started the war.
[00:27:13.851 --> 00:27:14.851]  They overthrew the government.
[00:27:14.851 --> 00:27:17.851]  They started trying to push the Russian people out of Ukraine,
[00:27:17.851 --> 00:27:21.851]  and Russia responded because it's in their heartland,
[00:27:21.851 --> 00:27:23.851]  and the quicker this war is over, the better,
[00:27:23.851 --> 00:27:30.851]  and Putin has not been expansionist.
[00:27:30.851 --> 00:27:32.851]  Putin has not been expansionist,
[00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:35.851]  and so I believe that after this is stabilized,
[00:27:35.851 --> 00:27:39.851]  Russia will then move forward with industrial expansion,
[00:27:39.851 --> 00:27:41.851]  not military expansion.
[00:27:41.851 --> 00:27:45.851]  I'm all for Russia becoming stable and successful,
[00:27:45.851 --> 00:27:47.851]  and I want Mexico to be stable and successful,
[00:27:47.851 --> 00:27:50.851]  and I want Brazil to be successful and stable,
[00:27:50.851 --> 00:27:53.851]  and I want Africa, I want Nigeria, and I want Libya,
[00:27:53.851 --> 00:27:55.851]  and I want South Africa to be stable,
[00:27:55.851 --> 00:27:57.851]  and I want Japan and China to be stable,
[00:27:57.851 --> 00:28:00.851]  and I want Germany to be stable, and France to be stable,
[00:28:00.851 --> 00:28:01.851]  and Canada to be stable.
[00:28:01.851 --> 00:28:03.851]  I mean, come on, folks.
[00:28:03.851 --> 00:28:04.851]  We're all humans here.
[00:28:04.851 --> 00:28:06.851]  We're all on one planet together.
[00:28:06.851 --> 00:28:08.851]  We've got plenty of resources, incredible ideas,
[00:28:08.851 --> 00:28:11.851]  and we can just go to the stars together
[00:28:11.851 --> 00:28:14.851]  instead of running around like a bunch of idiots,
[00:28:14.851 --> 00:28:18.851]  allowing a ruling class to create crises to pose as our saviors
[00:28:19.851 --> 00:28:23.851]  and use crisis management as the pretext to dominate and control
[00:28:23.851 --> 00:28:26.851]  and try to limit resources to we the people,
[00:28:26.851 --> 00:28:30.851]  because they're not trying to get rid of toxic technology.
[00:28:30.851 --> 00:28:32.851]  They're trying to get rid of technology that works
[00:28:32.851 --> 00:28:36.851]  and create a collapsed civilization because they compete with wealth.
[00:28:36.851 --> 00:28:41.851]  They want to make us poor so they can dictate the terms of our surrender.
[00:28:41.851 --> 00:28:44.851]  All right, we are going to go to break.
[00:28:44.851 --> 00:28:46.851]  We are going to come back,
[00:28:46.851 --> 00:28:51.851]  but they are definitely getting ready to blame Zelensky for the failure in Ukraine
[00:28:51.851 --> 00:28:53.851]  or, oh, I didn't hit the most important point.
[00:28:53.851 --> 00:28:56.851]  I forgot one key part of this when we come back.
[00:28:59.851 --> 00:29:01.851]  The globalists are only humans.
[00:29:01.851 --> 00:29:03.851]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[00:29:03.851 --> 00:29:05.851]  They have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[00:29:05.851 --> 00:29:08.851]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[00:29:08.851 --> 00:29:11.851]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body
[00:29:11.851 --> 00:29:15.851]  and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink
[00:29:15.851 --> 00:29:17.851]  and that you cook with,
[00:29:17.851 --> 00:29:20.851]  and you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:29:20.851 --> 00:29:22.851]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[00:29:22.851 --> 00:29:25.851]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[00:29:25.851 --> 00:29:30.851]  It purifies very quickly, and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[00:29:30.851 --> 00:29:32.851]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[00:29:32.851 --> 00:29:34.851]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price.

[00:29:52.851 --> 00:29:56.851]  and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[00:29:56.851 --> 00:29:59.851]  In some cases, they add to the water supply like fluoride.
[00:29:59.851 --> 00:30:01.851]  A lot of people have asked me,
[00:30:01.851 --> 00:30:05.851]  why is InfowarsStore at InfowarsLife, not at a probiotic for more than three years?
[00:30:05.851 --> 00:30:07.851]  The answer is simple.

[00:30:16.851 --> 00:30:20.851]  and said, we're not doing business with you, Mr. Jones, anymore.
[00:30:20.851 --> 00:30:23.851]  Finally, we've got a probiotic just as good or better

[00:31:29.851 --> 00:31:31.851]  Most over-the-counter toothpastes have fluoride.
[00:31:31.851 --> 00:31:33.851]  Ours don't, and it doesn't have fillers in it.
[00:31:33.851 --> 00:31:39.851]  It is just chock full of incredible things that God gave us through Mother Nature.

[00:32:12.851 --> 00:32:14.851]  Two separate formulas.
[00:32:14.851 --> 00:32:17.851]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[00:32:17.851 --> 00:32:21.851]  One is a four- to six-hour good base of clean energy,
[00:32:21.851 --> 00:32:23.851]  again, with no hangover or letdown.
[00:32:24.851 --> 00:32:26.851]  And the other is a very special proprietary formula,

[00:32:35.851 --> 00:32:38.851]  got to stay up until midnight working, doing a radio interview or something,
[00:32:38.851 --> 00:32:41.851]  and boom, writing an article or writing a book,
[00:32:41.851 --> 00:32:43.851]  and then I get two, three hours of energy,
[00:32:43.851 --> 00:32:44.851]  and then can go right to bed after it.
[00:32:44.851 --> 00:32:46.851]  Brain Force Ultra, Brain Force Plus,

[00:33:00.851 --> 00:33:04.851]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[00:33:04.851 --> 00:33:06.851]  it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:28.950]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:43.990]  Zapo Royskaya, that's a mouthful, the biggest nuclear power plant in Europe, some argue
[00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:52.070]  the biggest in the world, has been evacuated by the Russians who took it a year and a half
[00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:59.150]  ago, and Zelensky has been saying the Russians are going to blow it up with no evidence.
[00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:06.550]  Remember, he shot missiles into Poland last year and blamed Russia, but the Poles had
[00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:11.630]  NATO anti-missile defense systems and shot both down, so they got the damn tail numbers
[00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:16.590]  off of them, and they've been fired by Zelensky on purpose, clearly, from the trajectory.
[00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:18.150]  They weren't accidental missiles.
[00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:24.030]  He fired them in to blame the Russians and demanded, even when the Poles came out and
[00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:29.350]  said it was not the Russians, he went, I want you to attack NATO, attack now, use nukes
[00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:40.950]  if needed, and then out came that crazy, low IQ vegetable, and I've met him, I know him,
[00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:48.390]  to say we need to have nuclear war, and we shouldn't be against nuclear war, and I guess
[00:34:48.390 --> 00:34:55.630]  calling him a vegetable makes me a vegetable, what's his name, Fast Times at Ridgemont High,
[00:34:55.630 --> 00:35:00.790]  Harvey Milk, he's been in a bunch of movies, he's an idiot, Sean Penn, Sean Penn, Sean
[00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:01.790]  Penn, yeah.
[00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:07.990]  I mean, I've got Hollywood so dialed out of my brain, folks, I don't even, I mean, I got
[00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:12.910]  nuclear reactors names on my mind, and what's happening in South Africa, you know, and with
[00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:17.710]  riots and mass murder, I mean, I just, it's just, but we played the clips where he's like,
[00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:18.710]  what's wrong with nuclear war?
[00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:21.470]  It's got to be on the table, we can survive one.
[00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:30.510]  Hey, Sean, go jump off a cliff, buddy, burn in hell, you idiot, two moron actors, and
[00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:36.270]  I tell you, I take real pleasure watching Zelensky sink, and watching his bosses turn
[00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:40.270]  on him, but remember, the bosses are the main enemies, so let me finish the point
[00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:53.350]  about the Zaporozhskaya reactor, I know I'm butchering that, Z-A-H-P-O-H-R-O-Z-H-S-K-Y-A,
[00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:57.990]  he keeps saying that it's going to be blown up by the Russians, so Ukraine's losing, NATO
[00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:01.190]  looks bad, Russia hasn't escalated, what do they do?
[00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:04.670]  They stage a false flag, and I don't know if it's going to be blowing up a bridge or
[00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:07.870]  blowing up a pipeline and blaming the Russians, we've already seen that, I don't know if it's
[00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:13.630]  going to be blowing up a nuclear power plant, but I'm telling you, the globalists are, some
[00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:22.030]  of the factions of the globalists are crazy enough to do it, but it looks like they're
[00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:30.010]  testing the waters to flush him down the toilet and end this war, and that would be a very
[00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:41.010]  good thing, an extremely good thing, okay, let's now shift gears into this, and you talk
[00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:47.530]  about trying to do justice to something, everything we cover now is so bizarre and so over-the-top
[00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:58.650]  and so insane that it feels like a lie when you're saying it, I mean, does that make sense?
[00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:06.450]  Now, this doesn't sound real, it doesn't sound real that a month ago, Obama ordered
[00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:13.010]  the federal government, that's his, the president is Obama, ordered the federal government to
[00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:24.010]  stop taking DNA from unaccompanied children and babies, and then people that are accompanied
[00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:28.850]  but have no IDs, they can do in a day a DNA test to see if the person is the mother or
[00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:33.450]  father or if they're a grandfather or grandmother or if they're a sister or brother or if they're
[00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:39.090]  a first cousin up to like fourth cousins, why would you get rid of something, an inexpensive
[00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:43.770]  quick test, because you want to help the smugglers get away with them, but not just that, it's
[00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:48.330]  unaccompanied children with whatever ID they've got or whatever you make up, they then give
[00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:52.970]  them to Democrat aid groups, which have been caught all over the world, UN groups running
[00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:56.610]  the smuggling, hell, the deputy head of the Clinton foundation was convicted of smuggling
[00:37:56.610 --> 00:38:04.090]  kids out of Haiti, so they're doing some nasty stuff, folks, and you'd think that's not true,
[00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:09.770]  that doesn't sound true, though it's in the Washington Post, they're saying big deal,
[00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:13.610]  like it doesn't sound real, they took human trafficking and child sex trafficking and
[00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:20.490]  child prostitution and sex slavery off the federal websites this week, they did, it doesn't
[00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:32.290]  exist now, according to them, and these next clips I've got are so horrible that it's hard
[00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:38.690]  to process, it's hard to process Democrats saying, yeah, we kill babies as part of a
[00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:43.170]  satanic ritual in federal court, we want to keep it legal, we have women get pregnant
[00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:49.970]  on purpose so we can murder the baby in a ritual, now, what's wrong with that?
[00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:57.690]  I have that article right here, mainstream news, I'm going to cover that, California
[00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:03.770]  assembly Democrats block bill to make child trafficking a serious felony, that's right,
[00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:08.090]  California doesn't have a law that if you're caught with kidnapped children as young as
[00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:16.370]  five in sex slavery, that it's a felony, California has legalized sex with 12-year-old boys with
[00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:21.770]  adults, if they say it's consenting, a child of 12 can't be consenting, plus they tell
[00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:27.290]  the kids we'll kill your family if you say you didn't want to do this, standard procedure,
[00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:33.530]  California has legalized giving people HIV or hepatitis, California has said children
[00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:37.450]  from all over the country can run to their state and be sterilized outside of parental
[00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:42.230]  consent and outside of them being able to give consent because they're not at the age
[00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:47.790]  of consent, and California is now sterilizing children as young as seven who go with these
[00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:53.430]  quote providers, Washington state passed a law, Oregon is passing a law that if the child
[00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:59.670]  quote runs away as young as 10, they can be taken to a safe house and parents not told
[00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:05.030]  where they are under state funding, but who are the sponsors, the teachers, the pedophiles,
[00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:08.750]  the criminals in the community, they tell the 7, 8, 9-year-old, oh, don't tell your
[00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:12.030]  parents you're really another gender, we're going to put you in this club, don't tell
[00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:16.630]  them, oh, hey, next week you're going to escape, remember, never talk to your parents again,
[00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:22.270]  they have pedos on Facebook and TikTok telling kids just do no communication, cut them off,
[00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:27.790]  your parents are bad, just go with your friend and your guardian and your ally, and so a
[00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:32.470]  pedophile convinces your 7, 8, 9, 10-year-old that you're really going to have this incredible
[00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:37.110]  life of wondrousness, and then the states, multiple states are passing laws, governors
[00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:43.590]  are signing laws that you then disappear and the parents aren't told under state law
[00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:51.070]  where you are, and you're quote taken to a transgender house where it's all peer pressure,
[00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:57.070]  it's all control, you know, it's all pedo, right, yeah, there's the state senator that
[00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:06.470]  gets all these laws passed in California there, right there on the side there, wow.
[00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:15.390]  So this is a cult and they're turning California into a giant pedo command base, and we come
[00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:23.670]  back, we're going to play all these clips of when the victims of human trafficking where
[00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:26.590]  people were confirmed to be victims, where there was convictions, they're there, they've
[00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:35.630]  already testified, when they cry, the Democrats laugh and make jokes because they're on the
[00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:43.270]  payroll folks, big money in human baby parts and kidnap children's organs and delivering
[00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:48.270]  fetuses with still beating hearts to quote U.S. research facilities and universities,
[00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:53.910]  look that up, big money in all of this, but if they can convince your child particularly
[00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:58.870]  of their autistic or down syndrome, you're going to be a star now, we have fun parties
[00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:03.310]  at school where everybody worships you and you dress up like a girl and we give you prizes
[00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:07.390]  and is your mommy mean to you, would you like to go away to a nice place where you'll
[00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:11.150]  be with people like you, with your friends all the time, like a birthday party all the
[00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:18.110]  time, okay, sign right here, you're 8 years old, Billy, you were Billy, you're Jenny now,
[00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:22.310]  you're going to be at a party all the time and they load your kid in a van that day and
[00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:26.630]  the parents say Billy never got off the bus and they go, we don't know where Billy is and
[00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:35.270]  under state law, in places like Oregon and Washington State, your child disappears into
[00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:41.430]  a labyrinth of pedophiles and that's just the low level, Aleister Crowley scientists,
[00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:48.430]  Satanists that want to chop off their genitals and mutilate them in sacrifices and then it
[00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:54.710]  gets worse, if Billy ever tries to escape, Billy is going to be chopped up and thrown
[00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:57.510]  in the ocean, we're right back.

[00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:15.270]  you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it, the fish oil is better than it and
[00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:21.190]  that's an example of what I'm talking about, fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart,
[00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:24.950]  the cleanest, the best out there, krill oils is the best and it will give you the damn

[00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:32.790]  is hallucinogenic, it's so good, in my view, I'm not making a medical statement here but
[00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:36.870]  let me tell you something, I eat 5 capulets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing
[00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:47.750]  Santa Claus that night, so your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is, so
[00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:50.950]  we don't make a big profit off of it but you notice I just obsess because whatever the

[00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:08.390]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:28.580]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:32.299]  So, I mean, I knew the Globalists were Satanists, I knew that was their operating system decades
[00:47:32.299 --> 00:47:33.299]  ago.
[00:47:33.299 --> 00:47:38.340]  Because top experts had been fighting them long before I was born, told me that, and
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:39.900]  then I saw evidence of it.
[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:42.580]  But I thought it was only the top people.
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:44.380]  Back then it mainly was.
[00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:47.340]  But they have successfully made it the culture of the Democratic Party.
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:52.940]  I mean, if you go out to a pro-life vote at the Texas Capitol, or anywhere else for that
[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:57.180]  matter, these women show up in like church lady outfits that look completely normal,
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:02.060]  and they'll start hailing Satan and hissing at you and saying, I love the devil, I love
[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:03.860]  to kill babies.
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:07.220]  And their joke is they're trying to freak out Christians.
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:13.020]  But when you see how crazed they are, no, they really bought into it and don't get
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:16.799]  what they're into, and what they've been captured by.
[00:48:16.799 --> 00:48:22.060]  And so now the mainline culture has become this satanic situation.
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:27.299]  So about five years ago, I went to see Hail Satan, I think was the name of it.
[00:48:27.299 --> 00:48:34.420]  It was the movie about the big satanic church in the United States today.
[00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:38.779]  And they said, oh, we're a big part of Democratic Party now, and people love us, and thousands
[00:48:38.779 --> 00:48:39.779]  come to our events.
[00:48:39.779 --> 00:48:43.740]  And to be anti-Christian, we don't really believe in the devil, but we're being anti-Christian
[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:44.900]  just to be shocking.
[00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.259]  But then I looked at it and saw the people and looked them up.
[00:48:47.259 --> 00:48:53.620]  They were very serious and definitely into it, and very nihilistic.
[00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:58.779]  And then they filed in court, pure evil, latest Disney production, this cartoon about girl
[00:48:58.779 --> 00:49:03.980]  who inherits ritualistic killing, blood drinking, cult from her father, satanic temple that's
[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:09.380]  the movie Hail Satan's about, lawsuit claiming Texas law violates the religious right to
[00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:12.220]  abortion rituals dismissed by federal judge.
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:15.340]  They say killing the baby is a ritual, which it is.
[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:21.259]  Hellish, demonic freak fantasizes about being first tranny to implant uterus to abort a
[00:49:21.259 --> 00:49:26.060]  baby so they can carry out the sacrament of murdering their child.
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:28.540]  So these are not nice people.
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:31.060]  But you're thinking, well, that's just the freakazoids.
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:32.060]  No.
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:35.819]  You can see all the clips at Infowars.com.
[00:49:35.819 --> 00:49:37.660]  We're not going to play them all because there's hours of it.
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:39.299]  You can watch the whole hearings there.
[00:49:39.299 --> 00:49:51.420]  But California Assembly Democrats block bill to make child trafficking a serious felony.
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:58.380]  And again, in the new Disney movie, they mix the rainbow and LGBT P.S. with Satanism.
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:01.580]  That's how it all works now, folks.
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:07.420]  BBC fires top presenter accused of paying teen for forty five thousand dollars for sexually
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:08.500]  explicit photos.
[00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:09.500]  That's a side issue.
[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:10.500]  We'll get to it.
[00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:17.180]  D.O.J. removes international sex trafficking of minors from areas of concern page because
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:22.140]  there is no trafficking of children except what Biden does.
[00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:24.060]  So we've got these clips.
[00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:30.060]  But but just imagine here is the California Assembly Democrats block bill to make child
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:32.740]  trafficking a serious felony.
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:38.380]  California lawmakers, the Assembly Public Safety Committee blocked a measure that all Republicans
[00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:42.980]  voted for to classify human trafficking as of a minor.
[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:46.980]  As a serious felony under state law.
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:53.420]  All six Democrats in the committee voted against the proposal, while the two Republicans were
[00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:55.819]  the only ones to say yes.
[00:50:55.819 --> 00:51:00.220]  The results of the vote prompted members of the audience, some of whom had been traffic
[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:05.860]  victims who had testified themselves to openly sob in front of the committee.
[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:09.980]  The measure was halfway through the state's legislative process, having cleared the Senate
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:15.580]  state unanimously with broad bipartisan support.
[00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:19.900]  None of the six Democrats on the Assembly Public Safety Committee were willing to cast
[00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:22.060]  a vote on the measure.
[00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:30.220]  Republican Assemblyman Juan Alanis and Tom Lackey were the bill's only votes.
[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:32.740]  So let's go ahead and play.
[00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:36.800]  The first longer clip that I've got here on my list.
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:41.580]  Let's go ahead and play.
[00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:44.980]  Clip three and then let's play clip four after that.
[00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:49.700]  California lawmakers today rejected a measure that would make human trafficking of a child
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.500]  a serious felony.
[00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:55.779]  Reports say right now those convicted of trafficking people under the age of 17 are able to get
[00:51:55.779 --> 00:52:00.500]  out of prison early and serve much less time than what they're sentenced to.
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:05.060]  Case Area 3 Capitol correspondent Ashley Zavala explains both sides of this issue and why
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:10.740]  the lawmaker who wrote this bill was shocked by the vote today.
[00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:13.940]  California lawmakers in the Assembly Public Safety Committee today blocked a bill that
[00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:18.359]  would have defined human trafficking of a child a serious felony.
[00:52:18.359 --> 00:52:22.120]  This would have made it a strikeable offense, meaning it could put people convicted of trafficking
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:27.060]  children away for longer if they are convicted of trafficking them again.
[00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:31.279]  Right now, those convicted are eligible for early release credits, meaning their sentences
[00:52:31.279 --> 00:52:33.720]  can be significantly reduced.
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:36.440]  Supporters say this measure would have changed that.
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:40.340]  But opponents say more prison time doesn't get to the root of the problem and say there
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:44.080]  are already laws on the books that can put traffickers away for a significant amount
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:45.200]  of time.
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:47.920]  This bill was halfway through the legislative process.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:52.279]  It passed unanimously through the state Senate with broad bipartisan support.
[00:52:52.279 --> 00:52:56.600]  State Senator Shannon Grove, who authored the bill, told us she was blindsided by today's
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:57.600]  vote.
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:01.720]  You can pass a note to a bank and rob a bank.
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:07.060]  You can commit arson, and that's considered a serious felony, but to traffic a minor child
[00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:09.560]  in the state of California is not.
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:10.560]  That's something wrong.
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:15.400]  I mean, I'm talking zero to 17, where the average age is 10.
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:18.080]  They would not pass this bill.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:19.960]  Now the vote tally was two to zero.
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:24.600]  No Democrats were willing to vote for this bill, and those two votes came from Republicans.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:26.240]  This bill is not dead.
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:29.000]  It's just not moving forward for the rest of the year.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:33.200]  Discussions on this at the state capitol can pick up next year.
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.960]  Reporting at the state capitol, Ashley Zavala, KCRA 3 News.
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:40.840]  Well, if you may have noticed, the Assembly Public Safety Committee is known for blocking
[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:45.560]  measures that would increase prison time, recently rejecting similar measures for fentanyl
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:47.759]  dealers and domestic violence offenders.
[00:53:47.759 --> 00:53:51.880]  The chairman of the committee, Assemblyman Reggie Jones-Sawyer, has promised to work
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:54.359]  with Senator Grove on this human trafficking bill.
[00:53:54.359 --> 00:53:57.759]  Yeah, I don't want to put those fentanyl dealers in jail.
[00:53:57.759 --> 00:53:59.960]  They're really nice people, too.
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:05.720]  So California is a pedophile wonderland.
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:11.960]  California is a pedophile utopia, at least in the making.
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:15.400]  And we know California is the model for the rest of the country.
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:20.720]  I'm dumbfounded by Biden taking child sex trafficking off the federal website, saying
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:24.720]  it's not an issue, doesn't exist, and saying we're not going to DNA test kids that are
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:25.720]  unaccompanied.
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:29.319]  We just turn them over to random people or test who are they really with.
[00:54:29.319 --> 00:54:32.759]  The test takes a day, very inexpensive.
[00:54:32.759 --> 00:54:37.200]  But no, we're going to tell the children, come here, and adults, bring children.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:41.620]  It's the happy land to kidnap kids and bring them here.
[00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:44.160]  It's a pedophile paradise.
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:48.400]  Who was that singer died like last year, Coolio?
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:50.240]  Living in a gangster's paradise.
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:51.240]  Make sure Coolio died.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:52.240]  I'm going from memory here.
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:57.319]  I remember he used to be like bulletproof, and 100% now, he did die, right?
[00:54:57.319 --> 00:54:58.319]  He did.
[00:54:58.319 --> 00:55:02.600]  So maybe we should go out with, living in a gangster's paradise.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:03.600]  Maybe we can pull that up.
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.520]  But it's not a gangster's paradise.
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:07.160]  It's a pedophile's paradise.
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:10.560]  Okay, I got a lot more on this.
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:18.120]  We've got, man, economic news, four-shot news, central bank neutral currency news, RAIPS,
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:23.800]  criminally charged for role in January 6th, blames Tucker, he says to be criminally charged.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:31.080]  This is just crazy chutzpah and bravado by RAIPS, but I'll explain why they're doing it.
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:35.920]  Because they got jurisdictions, folks, where juries will do whatever a Democrat judge
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:36.920]  tells them.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:37.920]  Believe me, I've experienced it.
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:39.080]  So that's coming up next hour.
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:40.400]  Your phone calls as well.
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:43.560]  We're going to have a special guest, Dr. Rima Labo.
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:49.200]  But first, let me tell you, we've decided to extend on the products we still have in
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:57.640]  stock, the big mega sale, and we're calling it July is Patriot Pride Month.
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:01.800]  Now we don't have a red, white, and blue rainbow, but basically that's what it is.
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:02.800]  We love America.
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:03.800]  We love freedom.
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:04.800]  We love justice.
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:06.000]  We're not funding big tech companies.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.680]  We're not buying the stuff at Amazon.
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:10.359]  We're not going to the big box stores.
[00:56:10.359 --> 00:56:11.480]  We're not funding the New World Order.
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:15.680]  We're getting high quality products that are in stock, that fund freedom, that fund the
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:18.960]  resistance that are ready to ship right now.

[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:50.840]  The globalists are only humans.
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.920]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:55.359]  They have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[00:57:55.359 --> 00:57:58.560]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:02.680]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:06.759]  by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[00:58:06.759 --> 00:58:10.359]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:58:10.359 --> 00:58:12.560]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:15.240]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:19.480]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:21.840]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:25.800]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price for a limited time, 10% off on

[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:37.720]  Get it today and it funds the Infowar.
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:38.720]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:42.359]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists
[00:58:42.359 --> 00:58:45.080]  from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:48.759]  In some cases, they add to the water supply like fluoride.
[00:58:48.759 --> 00:58:49.759]  You wanted to plug RainForce.
[00:58:49.759 --> 00:58:50.759]  Do you like RainForce?
[00:58:50.759 --> 00:58:51.759]  Yeah.
[00:58:51.759 --> 00:58:52.759]  Yeah.
[00:58:52.759 --> 00:58:53.759]  So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[00:58:53.759 --> 00:58:55.759]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[00:58:55.759 --> 00:58:59.800]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:02.120]  two books with Alex Jones?
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:05.440]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:09.359]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[00:59:09.359 --> 00:59:13.359]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[00:59:13.359 --> 00:59:18.759]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce.
[00:59:18.759 --> 00:59:24.080]  I'll take RainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer, and I'm good for the next
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:26.600]  four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:32.319]  So it really is true that RainForce is something I use every day, and it helps me with my writing.
[00:59:32.319 --> 00:59:33.319]  All right.
[00:59:33.319 --> 00:59:34.319]  We love you.
[00:59:34.319 --> 00:59:35.319]  We'll be right back.
[00:59:35.319 --> 00:59:38.520]  Get your RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at InfowarStore.com.
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:40.680]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:56.680]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:58.840]  We'll be right back.
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:27.840]  I'm happy.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:30.840]  I'm still so strange and wild.
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.840]  I'm in the wind.
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.840]  I'm in the water.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:35.840]  Nobody's sun.
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.840]  Nobody's dark.
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:38.840]  That's right.
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:41.840]  Watching the chemtrails over the country club.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.840]  You think you're relaxing at your country club.
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:44.840]  You're away from the crime.
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:46.840]  You're away from the tyranny.
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:49.840]  You're isolated from what you've done to the public.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.840]  But you're being sprayed by aluminum dioxide, barium salts.
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.840]  The atmosphere is being cooked.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:55.840]  Nobody's safe.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  Chemtrails over the country club, boys and girls.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  There's nothing more avant-garde than Infowars.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  I don't say that from some sense of accomplishment.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  I mean, anybody else could have been avant-garde if they cared about the facts and researched
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  the globalist operation.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  All right.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:29.160]  We did a pretty good job last hour covering the fact that the Ukraine World War III operation
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:31.160]  is not going according to plan.
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:37.160]  Still a giant disaster and a terrible situation for everybody except the soulless globalist.
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:40.160]  But they're getting ready to scapegoat Zelensky.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:44.160]  They're looking at ending the war and blaming him.
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.160]  I don't know.
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.160]  They may double down again.
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:49.160]  But definitely they're having second thoughts about World War III with Russia right now.
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.160]  So that's a good thing.
[01:01:51.319 --> 01:01:54.319]  The over-the-top developments that I already mentioned.
[01:01:54.319 --> 01:01:58.319]  California is like, okay, well, okay.
[01:01:58.319 --> 01:02:02.319]  You're letting people out that are two-time sex traffickers of children.
[01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:06.319]  We really need to keep them in prison and charge them with felonies.
[01:02:06.319 --> 01:02:10.319]  They're like, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[01:02:10.319 --> 01:02:13.319]  And then I never played the clip, did I?
[01:02:13.319 --> 01:02:15.319]  I never got to the clip of them laughing about it.
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:20.480]  Yeah, here's Assemblyman Reggie Jones Sawyer
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:24.480]  was caught on a hot mic laughing at the victims of human trafficking
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.480]  who heckled him after blocking the bill.
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.480]  Here it is.
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:30.480]  A petition for reconsideration, sir.
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.480]  Oh, that bill fails.
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:35.480]  Reconsideration is granted unanimously.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:36.480]  Thank you, sir.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:37.480]  Thank you, sir.
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:40.440]  Power.
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:43.440]  Power.
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:45.440]  Power.
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:47.440]  Thank you.
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:48.440]  Power.
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:49.440]  I appreciate the remarks.
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.440]  Yeah, so that's Public Safety Committee Chair Democrat,
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.440]  Reginald Byron Jones Sawyer.
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.440]  He's laughing at the reaction there.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:01.440]  Republican State Senator Shannon Grove put forward the measure.
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:04.440]  Man, this guy's got more names than a Roman emperor!
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.520]  Man, this guy's got more names than a Roman emperor.
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:09.520]  So we've got all that.
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.279]  But let me tell you what we're going to cover when we come back.
[01:03:12.359 --> 01:03:17.560]  Ray Epps, our little sweetheart, he's filed a suit against Fox News.
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:23.120]  He blames Tucker Carlson for the fact that people think he was orchestrating
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:28.240]  things, though he sent a text message to family while he was there ramming signs
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:33.040]  into the police and leading the first breach that he quote orchestrated it.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:34.520]  Wow.
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.240]  You say, well, then why would he file a suit?
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:38.759]  Because they'll just it's in D.C.
[01:03:38.759 --> 01:03:42.560]  They'll have a controlled judge, controlled jury, 50 billion, 50 billion
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:43.080]  for ramps.
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:51.920]  I mean, in a controlled courtroom with weaponized systems, lawfare, 90 plus
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:56.120]  million to an FBI agent, never said his name, didn't know who he was, never
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:56.960]  showed a picture of him.
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:57.759]  None of my crew did.
[01:03:58.319 --> 01:04:00.920]  And then he just marches in and says, Alex Jones was mean to me.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:05.160]  One time somebody called my desk and said, are you really do you really work
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:05.880]  at the FBI?
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:09.920]  And the jury said ninety five million or ninety four million.
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:14.880]  Just. No evidence, never said his name, didn't know who he was, sued me.
[01:04:15.439 --> 01:04:18.080]  So, I mean, hell, Tucker said Rams his name.
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.720]  How about eighty seven trillion?
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.399]  How about all the money in the universe?
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.880]  And if a judge tells a Democrat jury, listen here, Fox News talked about this
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:28.880]  poor little baby cake.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:32.359]  They won't show ramps saying attack the building or go into the building.
[01:04:32.359 --> 01:04:33.760]  They won't show him saying go in.
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.480]  They won't show him ramming a sign.
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:38.319]  They won't show his text message saying I orchestrated it.
[01:04:38.319 --> 01:04:39.399]  They won't allow any of that in.
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:42.760]  They'll just go, here's this little baby cake right here.
[01:04:43.279 --> 01:04:44.359]  He can do a thing.
[01:04:44.359 --> 01:04:46.600]  And this mean Fox News did it.
[01:04:47.279 --> 01:04:52.760]  And that jury will say nine hundred eighty seven quadrillion dollars right now.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:55.680]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:03.439]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the
[01:05:03.439 --> 01:05:07.680]  electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops, they're hitting us with hundreds of
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:12.080]  chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:17.439]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine, the allowable level the
[01:05:17.439 --> 01:05:20.399]  government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to
[01:05:20.399 --> 01:05:24.840]  sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.720]  Look it up. Don't let them do this to your family.
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:30.880]  We have the very best gravity fed filter system out there.
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:34.120]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors.
[01:05:34.279 --> 01:05:36.600]  The Alexa Pure ready to ship to you right now.
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.720]  We have replacement filters for folks who've already gotten it.
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.560]  It does 10,000 gallons where you replace them.
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:43.439]  It is amazing. It's great for your home, your business.
[01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:46.520]  You put swamp water in it, tap water, whatever, well water.
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:47.840]  Almost everything's contaminated.
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:51.040]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:54.600]  globalist onslaught. Get yours today at Infowarsstore.com for a limited time.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.960]  We're running a 10 percent discount.
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.120]  That is a huge discount.
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:58.359]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[01:05:58.399 --> 01:05:59.240]  You need this filter.
[01:06:03.439 --> 01:06:10.120]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:18.080]  All right, a lot of people watch the clips of Ray Epps running around like a
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.480]  chicken with his head cut off.
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:26.319]  Saying go into the Capitol tomorrow, go in today, go in, go in.
[01:06:26.319 --> 01:06:29.560]  I orchestrated it, helping ram signs into police.
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:34.399]  And then our own Owen Schroer arrested, indicted, facing years in prison for
[01:06:34.399 --> 01:06:38.080]  being outside the Capitol, saying do not go in.
[01:06:40.359 --> 01:06:41.840]  He's facing years in jail.
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:46.240]  But Ray Epps has the New York Times defending him, everybody defending him.
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:50.600]  Well, now a real nightmare for the Deep State New World Order came true.
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:56.920]  Representative Nails, Republican, asked FBI Director Ray if he will arrest Ray
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:03.399]  Epps, then hours after this happened, the lawsuit was filed against Fox by Ray
[01:07:03.399 --> 01:07:08.680]  Epps with his lawyer saying he's been told by the FBI he will be indicted.
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:11.000]  That's probably like a psychological thing.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.439]  Like, oh, he will be indicted.
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:20.120]  But and we're suing Fox News because it's it's it's Tucker that's made
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.640]  people think he, quote, instigated it.
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:24.960]  No, you didn't say instigated.
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:31.439]  You said orchestrated, because when you instigate, you kind of just push
[01:07:31.439 --> 01:07:36.279]  somebody when you're the orchestrate, you're the orator, you're the conductor.
[01:07:36.439 --> 01:07:36.840]  You're up there.
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:39.439]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:45.640]  Can we pull up on YouTube a video of a conductor directing a symphony?
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.920]  Are we going to Porky Pig and the famous.
[01:07:50.279 --> 01:07:54.399]  Looney Tunes shows, so no, no, no, no, no, no, you didn't instigate, it's
[01:07:54.399 --> 01:07:56.680]  work, you said that you.
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:59.000]  Orchestrated.
[01:08:02.359 --> 01:08:05.080]  See, they say I orchestrate info wars.
[01:08:06.279 --> 01:08:09.439]  And I do, I'm the orchestrator now.
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:14.760]  It's more like jazz, though, because I'm not in control of the violins and
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:17.400]  the horns and the piano.
[01:08:17.639 --> 01:08:18.720]  It's more like I love liberty.
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:19.160]  I love freedom.
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:19.800]  What does everybody think?
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.360]  Have guests on, have a larger discussion.
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:21.960]  It's more like jazz.
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:22.840]  Like, what are you going to play?
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.240]  Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom.
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:25.639]  Somebody else over here doing something else.
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:26.639]  We're not, we're not.
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:28.760]  This is like a jazz operation.
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:34.360]  I'm not like a conductor that's hitting the violin and then ordering the harp
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:38.160]  and then having the piano hit and then the violins going and then no, no, no.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.760]  Maybe they even got a trombone in there.
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:44.600]  Maybe they've got a pipe organ.
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:48.520]  I'm not running any of that.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:50.920]  I'm not involved in any of that.
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:53.520]  I'm just simply trying to promote freedom.
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.760]  But, but he said, I orchestrated it.
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:58.240]  That's not instigated.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:02.480]  Instigate just means like you're at a football game.
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:03.639]  I went, yeah, get them.
[01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:03.920]  Yeah.
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:04.960]  Come on team.
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:06.920]  Or, or, or, or you're at a swim meet.
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:09.480]  Your daughter's about to win the, you know, the, the race.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:10.520]  Like, come on, baby.
[01:09:10.639 --> 01:09:11.920]  Come on, Charlotte.
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:14.040]  You can do it a little bit harder.
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:17.920]  That's instigating orchestrating is when you're running the show.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:23.160]  Like you're a general in a battle, commanding the forces and giving them the roars.
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:30.480]  So imagine in the text messages, he says, I orchestrated.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:36.400]  Let me tell you, a quarterback doesn't orchestrate a victory.
[01:09:36.559 --> 01:09:42.600]  The coach orchestrates, the quarterback executes and instigates.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:51.120]  So you've got the self-described conductor.
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:55.720]  Who's orchestrating orchestra.
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:56.600]  That's what that comes from.
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:58.080]  Orchestra orchestrating.
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:09:59.400]  Yeah.
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:04.360]  Only an, only an, only a master can orchestrate all these different people.
[01:10:04.559 --> 01:10:07.680]  He says, I'm an, I am a conductor.
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:13.200]  And now, Oh, they'll have to be a special jury and a special judge.
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.520]  No evidence will be shown.
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:15.840]  He'll just sit there and cry.
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:19.720]  And the jury will say 79 trillion, just 87 billion.
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:25.720]  It'll be just, just so the news will say ramps, innocent.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:30.280]  He fought the gen six invaders with a battle axe.
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:33.400]  He personally killed 500 of them like Samson.
[01:10:33.559 --> 01:10:37.840]  But Alex Jones came and overpowered him and forced his way in and then
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:40.240]  killed 9,000 members of Congress.
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.320]  I mean, that's preposterous.
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.720]  That's absurdist.
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:52.360]  That's a tight satirical, but who cares if there's death camps in China run by
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:58.240]  apple, because Tim cook wears a black turtleneck, you see, and Ray Adams.
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.600]  Where is a red Trump hat?
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:00.480]  You will see.
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:07.720]  So let's go ahead and go to this incredible excoriation of the FBI director.
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:13.480]  And then literally within hours of this happening, we hear, Ray apps will be
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:15.360]  indicted from his lawyer.
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.160]  Probably won't happen.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:20.080]  And that, Oh, it's all the fault of Tucker Turtleson.
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:20.800]  Here it is.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.400]  I, I, I, I don't, I don't, I don't think it's a good.
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:27.400]  Here it is.
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:32.400]  I want to turn my attention now to this fella, this character Mr. Ray Epps.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:35.400]  We've all heard of him. We've heard of Mr. Ray Epps.
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:38.400]  He was number 16 on your FBI Most Wanted list.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:43.400]  He was encouraging people the night prior and the day of to go into the Capitol.
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:48.400]  And Mr. Ray Epps can be seen at the first breach of Capitol grounds at approximately 12.50pm.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.400]  Play the clip, please.
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:56.400]  We need to go into the Capitol.
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.400]  Into the Capitol.
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:02.400]  We are going to the Capitol where our problems are.
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.400]  It's that direction.
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:07.400]  Please spread the word.
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:09.400]  Alright, no David, one more thing.
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.400]  Sir, can we go up there?
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:12.400]  No.
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:14.400]  When we go in, leave us here.
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.400]  We don't need to get shot.
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:37.400]  We want justice!
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:43.400]  There he is, breaching the line, going in at the first breach into the Capitol grounds, the restricted area.
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.400]  Mr. Ray, you have arrested hundreds of people related to January 6th.
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:50.400]  And there have been people arrested for breaching Capitol grounds.
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.400]  Cooey Griffin is an example.
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:54.400]  Rachel Genko is an example.
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:56.400]  And then we go to Mr. Brandon Strecker.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:03.400]  Brandon was arrested for disorderly and destructive conduct, which included yelling, I quote,
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:04.400]  Go, go, go!
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:07.400]  As rioters tried to empty the Capitol.
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:09.400]  These three never went into the Capitol.
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:11.400]  They never assaulted anyone.
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.400]  So let's be honest with each other.
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:18.400]  There is very little difference between the actions of Ray Epps and Brandon Strecker that day,
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:22.400]  but yet Strecker was arrested and Epps wasn't.
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:25.400]  Epps also testified to the January 6th committee.
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:29.400]  He was back at his hotel when video evidence showed that he wasn't.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:30.400]  He lied.
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:33.400]  He was on the Capitol grounds just as Brandon Strecker was.
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:37.400]  Epps even texted his nephew at 2.12 p.m. and said, I quote,
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:40.400]  I was in the front with a few others.
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:41.400]  It was on the video.
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:43.400]  I also orchestrated it.
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:47.400]  Now look into the camera, sir, when you answer my next question.
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:51.400]  Are you going to arrest Mr. Epps, yes or no?
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:57.400]  I'm not going to engage here in a discussion about individual people who are or are not going to be prosecuted.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.400]  And I get a commitment.
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:13:59.400]  You just watched the video.
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:00.400]  I'm an old law dog.
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:03.400]  I understand a little bit about probable cause.
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:04.400]  He did very little.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:07.400]  There was very little difference what he did and Mr. Strecker.
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:08.400]  You can see him.
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:09.400]  He's encouraging.
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:10.400]  He's encouraging.
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:11.400]  I almost think he's inciting a riot.
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:16.400]  He's encouraging people the night prior to go into the Capitol the day of.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:17.400]  Go into the Capitol.
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:22.400]  And he was at the first breach and he breached the restricted area.
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.400]  Everybody, a lot of people get arrested for not going into the Capitol.
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:26.400]  But you're in the restricted area.
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:31.400]  But yet, Ray Epps, who many people feel fed, fed, fed.
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:32.400]  Right.
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:33.400]  And there's a lot of clout over this.
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:35.400]  So my point is this.
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:37.400]  You arrested a lot of folks for unlawful activity.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.400]  You just saw the video.
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:43.400]  And I will tell you, if you don't arrest Mr. Epps, there's a reason behind it.
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.400]  I believe you know what it is.
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.400]  And it appears to me you are protecting this guy.
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.400]  I strongly recommend you get your house back in order.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:51.400]  With that, I yield back.
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:58.400]  So you ask again, how does Ray Epps say go into the way more than Strecker did?
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:01.400]  How does he do that?
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:02.400]  And then he's protected and defended.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.400]  Well, I mean, you know what's going on.
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:06.400]  But you're not supposed to say that.
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.400]  So now his lawyer says he's going to be indicted.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:11.400]  Let's not hold our breath and see if that happens.
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:14.400]  Or they can indict and kind of drop the prosecution later.
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:16.400]  Because they know they've got a problem here.
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:19.400]  They put, what, over 800 people in jail so far.
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:21.400]  Many of them totally peaceful outside.
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:27.400]  They're trying to put Owen Schroyer in jail for being there with me.
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:29.400]  You say, why did they indict you?
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:33.400]  They figured I was already a big enough figure where they wouldn't be able to contain me.
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:34.400]  They think, oh, and they can.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:35.400]  But it's not working.
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.400]  But it's not working.
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:37.400]  Owen's exploded.
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.400]  The work he's doing is amazing.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.400]  But we're fighting hard for everybody, folks.
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.400]  This is very, very serious.
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:43.400]  All right.
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:48.400]  I want to get into something I didn't cover when it came to the California trying to keep kidnapping children legal.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.400]  Yes, it's legal in California.
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:51.400]  You heard them, basically.
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:54.400]  I'm going to get into the devil worship of the Democratic Party when we come back.
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.400]  I have a special guest, Dr. Remo Labo.
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:00.400]  The globalists are only humans.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.400]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.400]  They have a lot of power.
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:04.400]  But they can be defeated.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:07.400]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:16.400]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:19.400]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.400]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:24.400]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:29.400]  It purifies very quickly, and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.400]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:33.400]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price.
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:36.400]  For a limited time, 10 percent off on top of that.
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:41.400]  Exclusively at InfowarsStore.com on the Alexa Pure water filtration system.
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:45.400]  In stock and replacement filters for folks that need those in stock.
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:47.400]  Get it today, and it funds the Infowar.
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:48.400]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:55.400]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:58.400]  In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:03.400]  InfowarsStore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:05.400]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.400]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.400]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:10.400]  Hey, what's better?
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.400]  Knockout.
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:12.400]  What's better?
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:13.400]  Down and out.
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:14.400]  What's better?
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:16.400]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:21.400]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:24.400]  So one person might like this coffee.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.400]  Another person likes that coffee.
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:27.400]  That's how our bodies work.
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:28.400]  They're all very diverse.
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:39.400]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfowarsMD Good Night Sleep.

[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:04.400]  A lot of people have asked me, why is InfowarsStore at InfowarsLife not at a probiotic for more than three years?
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:05.400]  And the answer is simple.
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:08.400]  We only bring you the highest quality at the lowest prices.
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:13.400]  We had a top maker, top certified of probiotics for more than seven years.
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:18.400]  They got bought by a libtard company and said, we're not doing business with you, Mr. Jones, anymore.
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:24.400]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:28.400]  We're able to private label it under InfowarsMD as our probiotic formula.

[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:11.400]  And for a limited time, they're 50% off when you get them together or 40% off when you get them individually.
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:15.400]  Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra, two separate formulas.
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:18.400]  They both give you good clean energy without the crash.
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:24.400]  One is a four to six-hour good base of clean energy, again, with no hangover or letdown.
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:27.400]  And the other is a very special proprietary formula.
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:29.400]  That's Brain Force Ultra that hits really, really quick.
[01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:30.400]  And I love it.
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:31.400]  It wears off in two to three hours.
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:36.400]  So if I've got to work at night but don't want to stay up all night, I can take it and stay 9 o'clock at night.
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:38.400]  Got to stay up until midnight working, doing a radio interview or something.
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:41.400]  And boom, writing an article or writing a book.
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:45.400]  And then I get two, three hours of energy and then go right to bed after.
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.400]  Brain Force Ultra, Brain Force Plus, both.
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:50.400]  50% off by themselves or 40% off individually.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:52.400]  A lot of people love these products.
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:53.400]  They've got five-star reviews.
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:55.400]  But if you haven't tried them, you really should.
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:58.400]  50% off, InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:06.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:18.700]  So here's the facts. California is basically legalizing pedophilia, saying child sex traffickers won't even get in trouble.
[01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:21.700]  You can give people HIV or hepatitis and not get in trouble.
[01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:27.700]  Places like Washington State have passed laws where they can grab your kids as young as 7, 8 years old and put them in a facility,
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:32.700]  never even telling you where they went, because they're protecting your child because you're transphobic,
[01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:37.700]  and then they can basically complete the sexual mutilization of the children.
[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:42.700]  And then you see that clip we played, there's a bunch of these clips from CNN yesterday.
[01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:47.700]  These right-wing crazy nuts say child trafficking's happening and it's connected to Satanism.
[01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:52.700]  They're just nuts. But it's everywhere. Just today, look at these headlines.
[01:20:52.700 --> 01:21:01.700]  Pure Evil, latest Disney production, is a cartoon about a girl who inherits a ritualistic killing, blood-drinking cult from her father.
[01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:03.700]  We're going to play you that trailer in a moment.
[01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:12.700]  Satanic Temples, lawsuit, claiming Texas law violates the religious freedom to abort, to abortion rituals,
[01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:17.700]  dismissed by a federal judge, saying it's a ritual to kill babies.
[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:27.700]  Hellish Demonic Freak fantasizes about being first trainee to implant uterus in aborted babies.
[01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:33.700]  So again, implant a uterus and then abort the babies. That is their crazy dream.
[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:40.700]  I want you to pay to put a uterus in me so I can kill a baby, because I want to be a woman that kills babies.
[01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:45.700]  And he's wearing his Illuminati buttons, all the rest of his little buttons.
[01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:51.700]  I mean, this is the scum of the earth in a revolution against us, completely coming after us.
[01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:55.700]  And I bet you by bottom dollar, that individual's into Satanism.
[01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:59.700]  But let's go ahead and roll the program.
[01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:13.700]  Praise Petty is set to premiere in July 21st at 10 p.m., and it's owned and promoted by Disney.
[01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:18.700]  So here is the trailer for that, and then let's back-to-back go ahead and play
[01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:23.700]  The Hellish Demonic Freak fantasizes about being first trainee to implant uterus in a born baby.
[01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:29.700]  It's morning again. The sun is shining. The ghosts are screaming.
[01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:36.700]  And I'm still here, despite the fact that last night I witnessed someone get ritualistically murdered by my dad's cult that I just inherited.
[01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:38.700]  Oh, here we go.
[01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:46.700]  I'm Petty. I had it all.
[01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:47.700]  Mother!
[01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:48.700]  Here.
[01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:49.700]  What's this?
[01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:50.700]  It's a message from your father.
[01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:56.700]  It's me, your father. The community of New Utopia is all yours.
[01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:01.700]  I just needed to figure out my place in my dead dad's weird town.
[01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:03.700]  I'm walking here.
[01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:06.700]  The great daughter! She's arrived!
[01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:12.700]  Welcome to New Utopia.
[01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:16.700]  I'm new to this being the cult leader thing. Thank you.
[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:19.700]  But I was excited to get to work.
[01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:20.700]  Do you need this hammer?
[01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:22.700]  Yeah, just put it between my pecs.
[01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:30.700]  Is this town doing okay?
[01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:31.700]  No, we're starving.
[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:35.700]  You being here means the prophecy of the great daughter's return is fulfilled.
[01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:38.700]  I'll make New Utopia normal.
[01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:41.700]  No more human sacrifice.
[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:44.700]  Tell me what to do!
[01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:47.700]  No!
[01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:54.700]  Surprise!
[01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:59.700]  I have a vision for New Utopia, and it is right!
[01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:03.700]  Everyone is happy to have someone to mindlessly follow.
[01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:10.700]  I love the leaders, and the comet is coming!
[01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:13.700]  Ha! You blinked.
[01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:18.700]  We need you here so the comet will return.
[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:23.700]  Oh, God. It's a space cult? Oh, of course. Boomers love space.
[01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:29.700]  All right, praise Petey. And by the way, when I watched that this morning,
[01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:33.700]  I was watching on my phone, so I didn't see it said Mike Judge is the producer.
[01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:36.700]  Well, I'm good friends with Mike Judge. Used to hang out with him all the time.
[01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:39.700]  Then I just got busy, he got busy, and we haven't hung out in years.
[01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:42.700]  My wife's a big Beavis & Butthead fan. She's like, we need to go hang out with Mike Judge.
[01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:44.700]  We gotta go hang out with Mike Judge. Please call Mike Judge.
[01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:47.700]  I'm like, you don't normally care about my famous friends, but I want to hang out with Mike Judge.
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:51.700]  And so she didn't want to go to the opening of Joe Rogan's Comedy Club 2.
[01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:54.700]  We did that, but I'm going to call him tonight.
[01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:57.700]  But there I am saying, hey, look at all the Satanism.
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:24:59.700]  This is like, we're not going to kill people anymore.
[01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:02.700]  Because I know Mike's aware of the New World Order, doesn't like it.
[01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:04.700]  He made King of the Hill, Beavis & Butthead.
[01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:09.700]  King of the Hill is still the top-grossing TV program ever, even ahead of Seinfeld.
[01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:12.700]  It's made $2 billion. Pretty crazy, but I'm definitely...
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:15.700]  Funny, I said a couple of days ago, I'm going to call Mike Judge.
[01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:19.700]  I'm going to call Mike today and say, what is the meaning of this?
[01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:21.700]  His last big hit was Silicon Valley.
[01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:26.700]  But my point is, it's entering the main culture that there are rich, elitist millionaires
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:30.700]  that want Satanism and claim it's going to create a utopia.
[01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:34.700]  Because I was just talking about how they want this leftist pedo-utopia yesterday.
[01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:38.700]  Then I watched this trailer, it's talking about this utopia.
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:40.700]  This is what these crazies are pushing.
[01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:43.700]  This is really hitting peak pedo right now.
[01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:49.700]  Mike Judge, that only makes big hits, has a new Disney TV program coming out
[01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:57.700]  about Satanism, secret cults, worldwide elites, rich people setting this up.
[01:25:57.700 --> 01:25:59.700]  Absolutely crazy.
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:01.700]  Gateway Pundit calls it pure evil.
[01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:04.700]  I'm going to give Mike Judge a bit of doubt because Beavis & Butthead is pure funny
[01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:07.700]  and King of the Hill is pure Americana.
[01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:12.700]  Looks like they're just exposing the occultists and how bad they are.
[01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:16.700]  You heard her in there saying, we're going to stop sacrificing people now.
[01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:18.700]  But I'm going to find out.
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:19.700]  I'm going to call Mike.
[01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:20.700]  I'm going to get his take on it.
[01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:24.700]  I'll assure you, once the show comes out, I will watch it and give you my views on it.
[01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:26.700]  Mike's a really smart guy.
[01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:31.700]  He was one of the head guys when he was 20-something years old on the F-18 project.
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:32.700]  He was one of the managers.
[01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:34.700]  He's a physicist, mathematician.
[01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:40.700]  Took his money for that project and went and made Beavis & Butthead that he hand-drew
[01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:41.700]  that became a super hit.
[01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:43.700]  So I really, really respect him.
[01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:45.700]  But let me tell you who I don't respect is this person.
[01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:47.700]  Let's go to this clip.
[01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:53.700]  Hellish demonic freak fantasizes about being first trainee to implant uterus and abort baby.
[01:26:53.700 --> 01:27:00.700]  Radical male trans activist claims he wants a uterus and ovaries scientifically implanted
[01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:04.700]  which he'll use to get impregnated before murdering a baby via abortion.
[01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:06.700]  Here is this individual.
[01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:13.700]  The first trans woman to have a successful uterus transplant, ovaries and eggs included.
[01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:19.700]  And I want to be the first trans woman to have an abortion.
[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:27.700]  I will let a doctor who has successfully transplanted a uterine complex before
[01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:32.700]  cut the organs out of a willing, healthy, transmasculine donor.
[01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:34.700]  Hit pause. Hit pause.
[01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:37.700]  You hear the cut the organs out of the willing.
[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:38.700]  I mean, it's literally Hellraiser.
[01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:40.700]  Cut the organs out.
[01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:44.700]  I want to have a woman kill the baby.
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:46.700]  And I'm sure they'll be like, oh, we gotta pay for it right now.
[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:48.700]  And that's how sick this is.
[01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:49.700]  I mean, go back to this.
[01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:52.700]  To have an abortion.
[01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:59.700]  I will let a doctor who has successfully transplanted a uterine complex before
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:04.700]  cut the organs out of a willing, healthy, transmasculine donor.
[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:07.700]  Place them in my body.
[01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:13.700]  I will devote myself, heart and soul, to their aftercare.
[01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:19.700]  I will have as much gay sex as it takes.
[01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:23.700]  With as many trans women as it takes.
[01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:29.700]  And let the transphobes and homophobes scratch their heads,
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:32.700]  wondering what to make of it.
[01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:34.700]  That's it. So it's total mad scientist.
[01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:36.700]  I'll do anything.
[01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:39.700]  Once you see this, you're like, well, I don't care if they have animal human clones.
[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:42.700]  Or I don't care if we release GMOs from mosquitoes.
[01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:43.700]  Everything's so crazy.
[01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:47.700]  They're just glorifying the scum to totally confuse everybody.
[01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:49.700]  Wow, what a piece of filth.
[01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:52.700]  Burn in hell, scumbag. Burn in hell.
[01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:01.700]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots,
[01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:04.700]  or the electromagnetic 5G, or the GMO crops.
[01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:08.700]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized
[01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:10.700]  companies and industry to use.
[01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:13.700]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:17.700]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply
[01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:22.700]  is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:25.700]  Look it up. Don't let them do this to your family.
[01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:28.700]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there.
[01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:31.700]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors.
[01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:34.700]  The Alexa Pure, ready to ship to you right now.
[01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:36.700]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:38.700]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:41.700]  It is amazing. It's great for your home, your business.
[01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:44.700]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:46.700]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:50.700]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.
[01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:52.700]  Get yours today at Infoworkstore.com for a limited time.

[01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:57.700]  You need this filter.
[01:29:57.700 --> 01:30:02.700]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia,
[01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:07.700]  the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy,
[01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:10.700]  you are crazy, in my view, if you don't get high-quality storable food
[01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:12.700]  and water filtration and self-defense.
[01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:14.700]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:17.700]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:19.700]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:24.700]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:26.700]  This is something you need now.
[01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:30.700]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high-quality water filtration department.
[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:34.700]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices

[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:04.700]  We made it even stronger.
[01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:08.700]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:15.700]  TurboForce is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:21.700]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:23.700]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:28.700]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:33.700]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver.
[01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:35.700]  You name it.
[01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:38.700]  It is the super fuel.
[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:41.700]  RainForce Plus is great. RainForce Ultra is great.
[01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:43.700]  They're two different nootropics. They go good with this.
[01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:45.700]  But this is the King Kong.
[01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:47.700]  This is the boss.
[01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:51.700]  TurboForce, back in stock, discounted, Infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:54.700]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:32:02.700]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:05.700]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:10.700]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers
[01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:13.700]  to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:16.700]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:19.700]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:21.700]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:26.700]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury,
[01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:29.700]  who was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time.
[01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:36.700]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:38.700]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:43.700]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:47.700]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water.
[01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:50.700]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water.
[01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:52.700]  And a remedy to this madness.
[01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:56.700]  Available now at Infowarsstore.com
[01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:03.700]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:05.700]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:34.440]  We're going to the real danger zone for the next hour, ladies and gentlemen, with Dr.
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:42.760]  of PreventGenocide2030.org. But here's a blast from the past. This has gone viral. It's probably
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:46.840]  had 100 million views conservatively. There's so many versions of it. Jesse Ventura's show
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:51.400]  with myself and Dr. Rima Lebo in 2009 with her nailing what was coming next.
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:58.280]  Jesse Ventura's conspiracy investigators have tracked down the deadly secret behind the elite
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:04.120]  group that tries to rule the world. When the population gets too big to handle,
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:12.520]  the solution is cut it down. There's an entire agenda afoot to force the population to undergo
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:18.360]  different type of medical treatments, namely vaccines. We're seeing a medical tyranny being
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:23.240]  set up not just in the United States, but worldwide under the UN and the World Health
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:29.240]  Organization. They want a planetary dictatorship so they can population agenda and they want to
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:34.280]  do it through the medical system. And that's why vaccines are so important. We know that many of
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:39.640]  these vaccines turn out to have serious adverse reactions. This is being done by design. They
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:45.720]  kill you slowly over time. That's why they're called soft kill. We must acknowledge that the
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:53.480]  genetic COVID-19 genetic injections cause far more harm than good and provide zero benefit
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:59.160]  relative to risk. The death rates from this vaccine are there's been more deaths in eight
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:05.160]  months than in all the billions of vaccines combined over the last 30 years. 50% of the
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:09.640]  deaths occur within 48 hours, 80% within a week. And I've got an insider I think you should really
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:17.400]  talk to Dr. Rima Labo. In a very short time, not today, not tomorrow, but very soon, we'll be
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:25.800]  facing compulsory vaccination under the mistaken term of voluntary vaccination. Now, what is it
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:30.200]  about these vaccinations? You think that they're bad? Well, first of all, let's start with the
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:38.360]  fact that the World Health Organization has decided that we have 90% too many people.
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:45.960]  The World Health Organization has been working since 1974 on vaccines to create permanent
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:52.280]  sterility. Now, this is pretty shocking. This process has already been ongoing. To make matters
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:36:01.400]  worse, the vaccines that were illegally approved by the FDA contain a substance called squalene.
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:07.640]  Squalene, an organic compound used in vaccines to stimulate the immune system and increase the
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:16.120]  response. If I inject you with squalene, you're immune. Dr. Rima Labo, medical doctor,
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:24.680]  preventgenocide2030.org, preventgenocide2030.org joins us for the rest of the next hour. And wow,
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:29.400]  where to begin? She's got a bunch of UN documents that are public for this UN World Treaty,
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:35.240]  the announcements of the Central Bank digital currencies, the announcement of the medical IDs,
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:41.080]  the vaccine passports. It's all coming. It's all here. So, doctor, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:47.480]  Thank you. It's always a pleasure to talk to you, Alex. And this is such an important conversation.
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:50.840]  I'm really glad we're talking today. Well, let's plunge right into it.
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:52.760]  Because you said it's a lot of documents to go over.
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:37:02.840]  I did. Let's start with the fact that the UN and the WHO, which is a subsidiary servant
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:07.960]  organization, like UNESCO and UNICEF and Food and Agriculture Organization,
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:16.680]  are designed to control the entire world to be a world dictatorship, the likes of which
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:26.360]  we have never seen. And up until now, their very pretty contour, their makeup, their facade
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:34.440]  has been all benign and lovely. But those pretenses are falling away.
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:43.800]  On the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, the member states asked, and there are quotes
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:50.760]  around all of that, the member states asked the Secretary General Gutierrez, who is a very scary
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:38:00.760]  dude, but they asked Gutierrez to come up with a new document to move the UN further than its
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:08.600]  already quite terrifying charter takes it. Now, if you read the UN charter, which I did in high
[01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:14.520]  school as part of my civics class, and frankly, I was bored out of my mind by it. But if you read
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:21.480]  it now, you'll see that it takes over everything. That's how it's written. And they said, but that's
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:29.800]  not enough. They said, what if there are more shocks? There are global shocks. And I sent you a
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:38.440]  documented misspelled call, a document called Annotated Global Shocks Plan for September 2024.
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:41.800]  That's right. We'll put all that on the screen. So they're talking about, and previously,
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:47.560]  we're going to use disease X, they said four years ago, to bring the UN into control. That was COVID.
[01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:52.280]  Now they're saying we need more global shocks. And so we'll put those documents on screen.
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:39:02.040]  And this document says that this shows that the global shock concept, which is anything,
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:09.960]  it can be climate change, it can be slowed down in the supply chain, it can be a black swan event,
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:16.920]  something we don't know yet. It can be another pandemic, it can be nothing at all. It can be
[01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:24.760]  the threat of having a global shock. It could be a war, like, for instance, the, by the way,
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:32.920]  speaking of war, the United Nations was formed, allegedly, to prevent wars. And I would like to
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:40.040]  point out that I can't think of a single conflict that the United Nations successfully either
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:45.720]  prevented or brought to a conclusion sooner. They're certainly not doing much of a good job
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:49.960]  in the Ukraine. Their specialty is cheerleading wars.
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:56.360]  They cheerlead wars because, of course, the people who control the United Nations and the
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:40:03.640]  globalist hegemony organizations and structures make money from wars, and they also depopulate
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:09.480]  and control for wars. So wars are very useful for them. So anyway, once we have all these global
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:17.400]  shocks that could happen to us, there's only, from their point of view, one possible way to
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:22.920]  deal with the possibility of global shocks. And that is to take over the entire world.
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:30.200]  And that's just what they've planned to do. So on the 75th anniversary of the globalist
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:35.400]  organization, which was written and designed to take over the world, eventually,
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:41.960]  the member states said, tell us how we can take over the world, Director General Gutierrez.
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:48.360]  And Director General Gutierrez was only too happy to do so. He produced a document called
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:59.160]  Who We Are. And the document called Who We Are states that we are a group of people who are
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:08.600]  going to control everything because we say we can. And given global shocks, we can control
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:15.720]  communication, we can control academia, we can control supply lines, we can control manufacturing,
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:22.920]  we can control food, we can control everything because, as they say, that's who we are.
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:31.960]  And the special report of the Secretary General says we have a common agenda. And that common
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:37.960]  agenda, and these are public documents that are available to anyone, the public document
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:46.280]  is filled with hyperbole and filled with misstatements which have absolutely no documentation
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:54.760]  and no reality. Statements like we are at an inflection point in history in our biggest
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:59.960]  shared test since the Second World War. Humanity faces a stark and urgent choice,
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:06.040]  a breakdown or a breakthrough. What are they talking about? This is puffery of the most
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:09.160]  political sort. And then meanwhile, I want to play a short clip to back you up.
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:15.480]  They say, oh, COVID came from global warming. No, it was in a lab. Oh, there's migrants flooding us
[01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:20.200]  because of COVID and global warming. No, you locked them down and then organized them to
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:24.280]  come here. So they're saying global warming is going to cause a civilizational collapse
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:28.120]  and it's all our fault. But they're the ones administratively through the big banks,
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:32.600]  through the Fortune 500, through the U.N. literally collapsing civilization.
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:36.360]  And then John Kerry comes out a few days ago in Europe and says, don't worry,
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:40.200]  there'll be more resources under this. But but in their own reports, they say they're
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:47.160]  going to cut the resources off. Here he is. And we're seeing already in every aspect of life,
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:52.760]  it is now being affected by the climate crisis. But again, I say this is not something where
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:57.320]  everybody has to go, oh, my God, I don't want to do this because it's scary as hell and because
[01:42:57.320 --> 01:43:01.560]  we're not going to live the way we did. No, we will have a better quality of life.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:08.280]  So under your research, I mean, I have their official U.N. report saying we're limited 200
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:15.320]  square foot coffin apartments need bugs. Exactly. That is exactly where they want us to go.
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:24.040]  And they have decided that the way to do this is to have a plan. And the plan is to go from
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:29.960]  the common agenda, which the secretary general of the United Nations says we have. And in fact,
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:37.000]  we do not. Their agenda is not my agenda in any way to go from that to a roadmap for
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:44.200]  a pact for the future. They have put out something. They have beautiful graphics,
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:49.960]  by the way. They really have excellent public relations people. So they have something called
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:56.520]  a road to the summit of the future. And they have decided that there will be a summit of the future
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:44:04.920]  held in September 2024. And at that time, a pact for the future will be signed, which will be
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:13.720]  administered by and implemented by former heads of government. That's W.E.F. guys, right? Like
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:20.920]  Jacinda Ardern, for example, like every one of our former presidents, like Justin Trudeau,
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:27.160]  if he is a former prime minister at that point, they've got a whole roster of people that they've
[01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:33.400]  put capes and and crowns on to say that there's something special when really they're despicable
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:40.280]  sock puppets who are perfectly happy to sell us all out for their own well-being. So this
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:46.840]  pact for the future is going to bring us global solidarity and sustainability. Anytime you hear
[01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:54.520]  words like that, you know that they're planning something destructive. So they rode to the summit
[01:44:54.520 --> 01:45:02.280]  for the future. And by the way, their global shocks pact and summit plans will be implemented
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:11.640]  in September 2024, just before the U.S. election. I wonder how that happened. So they've got this
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:16.840]  roadmap and they've got a common agenda. And one of the things that they've done, Alex, and this
[01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:22.600]  is really important, and I know you've talked about it a lot, is that they have weaponized
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:29.800]  language. What does that mean? That means that they take words like human rights and they
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:36.840]  redefine that so that it means our ability to destroy becomes human right is to take your
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:45.000]  seven-year-old and cut their genitals off. A human right is to censor you. Yeah, exactly. And that
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:52.760]  is precisely the point. Now, one of the things that they've defined, as you said, is that sexuality,
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:46:02.360]  the sex life of every child, is a human right. Let me point out, as a child and adolescent
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:07.800]  psychiatrist, as a mother, as a human being, as a rational person, the children don't have a sex
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:15.320]  life. Children have an experiential life in which they experience feelings from every part of their
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:22.200]  body, correctly and appropriately. They experience genital feelings and physical feelings of other
[01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:29.160]  sorts. And they're exploring how all of that feels. And that's great. But children do not have a sex
[01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:36.840]  life. However, on March 8th of this year, this same dastardly despicable body known as the United
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:44.520]  Nations said, hey, jurists, hey, criminal prosecutors, hey, legislators all over the world,
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:52.840]  let's reformat, let's reform and reformat our entire legal structure and decriminalize
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:47:00.600]  sex with anybody as long as that anybody says, okay. And as I've said on your program and as
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:07.080]  other people have commented, that means that if somebody says, hey, little boy, hey, little girl,
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:12.440]  touch me here and I'll give you a piece of candy. And the kid who's two years old, three years old
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:20.440]  says, okay. That means that child has consented and there's no disparity in power or capability.
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:25.640]  So they're getting rid of saying that children, children aren't of age. You don't have consent to
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:30.040]  buy a rocket launcher or join the military or skydive or, you know, do any of this. I mean,
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:34.360]  this is an absolute targeting of children. And since we've been talking about this,
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:38.120]  Biden took off child trafficking is an issue of the U.S. government websites.
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:42.120]  They stopped DNA testing of children that they're finding at the border so they can disappear them
[01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:47.560]  into wherever knows next. California will not even make it a felony to be caught sex,
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:52.920]  trapping a child the second time they're legalizing sexual 12 year olds in California.
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:57.480]  They're legalizing. They did legalize giving somebody HIV or hepatitis. I mean, they're
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:03.160]  really making their move. How many of these pedophiles are there? Like, I mean, how big is
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:10.280]  this submerged iceberg? Because when you have the corporate media attacking movies like Sound of
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:15.000]  Freedom and just saying it's not true, there's no sex trafficking while they sexualize children
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:20.520]  everywhere, all over the news and TV removed and while they remove sex trafficking from
[01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:27.880]  activities of interest from our justice system. Yes. I mean, it's so this is a pedophile revolution.
[01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:32.600]  What is it about at its base? Is it is there a group behind that or is it just a pedophile army?
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:40.760]  Let's talk about what happens when you hyper sexualize children, when you rape children,
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:47.160]  when you intrude on their psychosexual development. What happens is that you truncate,
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:51.720]  you cut off, you freeze their emotional development. If you
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:49:01.240]  rape and traumatize every single child and then continually re traumatize them, because remember,
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:09.000]  the entire educational curriculum worldwide is being focused through a lens of sexuality. Math
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:14.360]  is to be taught through sex. That's their entire cult is sexually manipulating a child,
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:17.720]  ruining their development, steering control, their development. You're talking about trauma
[01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:23.960]  based mind control. I'm talking about trauma based mind control, making people obedient,
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:31.880]  making people incapable of further thought when people have post traumatic stress disorder
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:35.880]  because they've been traumatized. And that's what we're talking about. Intentional
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:43.800]  bile traumatization. What happens is that they cannot see the future. They cannot think past
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:50.840]  the immediate fear and trauma and survival. So what you're doing is freezing people in a state
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:56.760]  of early childhood, emotional and psychological development. And you can give them facts and they
[01:49:56.760 --> 01:50:03.160]  can do math and be physicists or technicians or doctors or whatever. But emotionally, you have
[01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:09.480]  made them completely tractable and further controllable. So this is all about mind
[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:16.440]  control. Now, in Ireland, they're going to kill 200,000 cows, and the population is supposed to
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:25.160]  say, okay, kill 10% of our herd, our cattle herd, go ahead, do that. And in the Netherlands,
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:32.360]  closed down 10,000 farms, people are supposed to attractively say, okay, whatever it is that you
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:38.840]  want to do, because I can't think further than my immediate survival and pleasure. And that's the
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:47.880]  brave new world trauma based mind control that all of this UN stuff and all of this who stuff rests
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:54.200]  upon. Well, as a psychiatrist, you're an expert in this Dr. Labo. But I know I've read a lot of
[01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:58.600]  books about it seen in the history. I know Dr. Ewing Cameron, Jolene West, the CIA kidnapped
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:04.200]  10,000 plus children into Canada alone. There's been history channel shows to try to create mind
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:10.600]  control slaves. That's why they're young to compartmentalize them. So clearly, that's what
[01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:15.560]  they're doing. They're trying to accelerate development, the chemicals of the food and water,
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:19.960]  accelerate puberty, then they freeze you and arrest your development at that point, basically,
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:27.480]  is that accurate in layman's terms? It is accurate. It is teaching parents to become
[01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:33.880]  part of the perpetrator circle that surrounds children. It is teaching parents that they
[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:40.040]  should start masturbating their infants from birth. Now we know, interestingly, George Gordon,
[01:51:40.040 --> 01:51:48.200]  Lord Byron, the great poet, was treated in that way by his Scottish nurse, who believed that that
[01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:54.760]  was a good way to calm infants. So she masturbated him from his birth. And that's something that was
[01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:59.800]  taught by the lady they tried to make the surgeon general, Jocelyn Elder. She publicly said that
[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:05.160]  parents and administrators should masturbate one-year-olds. So this is sexual assault of
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:12.200]  one-year-olds. Yes, making everyone a perpetrator. So the child has nowhere to turn. The child has
[01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:18.280]  no one who is safe, who is interested in their own development rather than they're interested
[01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:22.760]  in their sexualization. And their own discovery as they go into puberty and that whole thing.
[01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:29.400]  Yeah, absolutely. Children, and let me tell you a secret. No child needs to be taught how to
[01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:37.320]  masturbate. Every kid figures it out. And they figure it out just fine. So instead of intruding
[01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:43.640]  on the psychosexual development of children in order to circumvent normal development and cut
[01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:49.240]  off normal development, another kind of castration, if you will, instead of doing...
[01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:55.480]  Right, draw a picture of your private places. You can touch your penis or vulva with a teddy
[01:52:55.480 --> 01:53:03.000]  bear figure because this is for very, very young children. This is perverted. This is wrong. And it
[01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:09.960]  creates people who are infinitely easier to control than you are, Alex, and that I am.
[01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:18.680]  So this is a real problem. But all of these things, our common agenda, Agenda 2030. Oh, by the way,
[01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:25.720]  all of this stuff, the global shock business and the path to the future and the future summit,
[01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:33.640]  all of that is based on accelerating Agenda 2030. Why? Because they're having a lot of trouble.
[01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:37.960]  They're behind schedule. They're not getting where they need to go. And we're halfway...
[01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:41.560]  And that was my next question. You got to come back soon to do like two, three hours commercial
[01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:45.480]  free. I'll come in Saturday if you want to do two hours commercial free to lay all this out. But
[01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:49.720]  we've got some in the next hour. But let me ask you this then. I totally agree. It's not going
[01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:56.200]  well. How? Why are they crazy enough to have ABC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, every channel? I mean,
[01:53:56.200 --> 01:54:01.080]  hundreds of clips I've seen. Well, I stopped watching after like the 30th clip. Hundreds
[01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:05.640]  I've read the transcript of where they're like, how dare the sound of freedom? It doesn't exist.
[01:54:05.640 --> 01:54:11.800]  So they've gone from admitting there's giant child sex trafficking to overnight taking it off
[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:16.040]  the federal websites, saying they're not going to do DNA testing of kids or just turn loose with
[01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:23.080]  no ID, small children. I mean, they are panicked right now, it seems. Is that accurate? That is
[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:27.880]  accurate. Now, that, of course, makes them more dangerous. But let's be clear about why they're
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:33.320]  panicked. They're panicked because of you, Alex. They're panicked because of me. Prevent Genocide
[01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:42.680]  2030. And by the way, our new Twitter account, prevent 2030. Or should say at prevent 20,
[01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:48.280]  prevent 2030. They wouldn't let us put the word genocide in our title on Twitter. That's
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:56.120]  interesting. They're panicked because people are saying, don't you dare? Don't you dare touch my
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:55:02.840]  child? Don't you dare take away my car? Don't you dare take away my house? Don't you dare tell me
[01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:11.160]  that I can't eat meat? Don't you dare tell me that the patriarchy has to be has to be a political
[01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:18.600]  concern for my one-year-old? Don't you dare sexualize education? People are saying, wait,
[01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:24.920]  what? No. And they're saying it all over the world. And that's why, as I have always said,
[01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:31.640]  they are terrified of our numbers. They are terrified of our power because they are not
[01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:37.400]  fully in power yet. And this means that this is our opportunity, because frankly, Alex,
[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:45.240]  if we miss this one, we won't have another. And look, you called it 12, 13 years ago in that
[01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:49.560]  super viral clip. And if you'd had more time on Ventura show, you laid more of it out for them.
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:54.040]  But they obviously had to edit it down for time. But you you've treated heads of state. They've
[01:55:54.040 --> 01:55:58.440]  let you on the plan. And I mean, you're not making this stuff up. You're on record as a top position.
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:03.400]  This is as serious as a heart attack. It's more serious than a heart attack,
[01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:09.000]  because a heart attack only kills the person whose heart it was. This is to kill all of us,
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:16.520]  either as living beings, making 90 percent or more of us basically toxic fertilizer.
[01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:21.160]  And they have, as you know, a new way of disposing of our massive number of corpses.
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:25.880]  And that is to digest us in lye and turn us into slime. I was about to say,
[01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:30.200]  20 plus states passed a law for mass death and to liquefy our bodies.
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:37.640]  Exactly, exactly. And the ones who are allowed to survive, the ones who are useful to them,
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:45.080]  we will be both mind controlled and genetically controlled through the so-called vaccines,
[01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:53.800]  through the nanotechnology. And by the way, Alex, I have a proposal into people who can fund it
[01:56:53.800 --> 01:57:00.920]  for a research project to find out exactly what will get the nanotechnology out of our bodies
[01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:08.600]  that has been injected or infected from the injected and to then make it available as a
[01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:14.760]  frequency for seven billion people. I agree. The number one question I get is how do we counter
[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:19.400]  because the globalists wouldn't have launched this attack of this nanotech self-replicating
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:25.400]  prion if they didn't have a cure? They have a cure for themselves, of course, we don't have
[01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:32.040]  that cure. And so it is urgently important. And that is a research project that I have.
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:38.600]  Certainly to reverse engineer. Where do people find out about that research project?
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:44.280]  Well, you know, we have a website called Prevent Genocide 2030,
[01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:51.800]  where we have information. With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders,
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:57.560]  the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:02.680]  You are crazy, in my view, if you don't get high quality, storable food and water filtration
[01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:06.680]  and self-defense. Now, we're not selling guns and ammo. That's for you to go out and get for
[01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:10.920]  yourself and learn how to use if you haven't. And I'm preaching the choir on that. But a lot
[01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:15.160]  of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:19.000]  This is something you need now. And we've got it in the food department
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.600]  and in the high quality water filtration department. The highest quality food,
[01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:27.160]  the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.
[01:58:27.160 --> 01:58:32.680]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10 percent off on all storable food
[01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:37.720]  and on water and air filtration. Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[01:58:37.720 --> 01:58:41.960]  Our prices are already the lowest at 10 percent off. It's an insane deal for a limited time.
[01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:45.960]  Go to Infowarsstore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:53.880]  Everybody running around here, I want to thank Alex Jones and Infowars for offering scholarships
[01:58:53.880 --> 01:59:00.360]  to River University. Maybe you're watching Infowars today and you don't know what to do
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:06.360]  with the problems that we face in the world today. You've been through COVID 19, 20, 19, 20, 21,
[01:59:06.360 --> 01:59:13.080]  22, 23. But here at River University, not only do we show you what the problem is, but we show you
[01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:19.880]  how to deal with it. Come, a full three year bachelor degree will train you up in ministry,
[01:59:19.880 --> 01:59:25.160]  government, worship, that you can go out and actually bring about a transformation

[01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:55.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:05.960 --> 02:00:23.720]  All over the United States, all over Europe, all over the world, anywhere the globals are
[02:00:23.720 --> 02:00:28.120]  in control, they're removing language about human trafficking and sex with children being bad.
[02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:33.160]  Transgender Minnesota lawmaker introduces bill removing anti-paedophile language
[02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:39.000]  from the state's Human Rights Act. Fox News. And now the federal government's expunging it
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  off their sites saying it's not even a problem, an issue. Dr. Rima Lebo is a trailblazer exposing
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:54.440]  this. Preventgenocide2030.org. Please continue with this assault and what you think is going
[02:00:54.440 --> 02:01:01.080]  to be their next salvo where they talk about creating these shocks, where they talk about
[02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:08.200]  creating these crises, what you think it's going to be. You mean what the next shock will be? Yes.
[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:14.600]  Is that what you're saying? Yes. It won't be another disease. People are disease weary.
[02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:25.320]  People are vaccine leery. And so being weary and leery of their prior manipulation. And by the way,
[02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:31.320]  I call it propagandemic. I want to emphasize again, and I know you've pointed this out and
[02:01:31.320 --> 02:01:37.560]  others are beginning to say it too, that we didn't have a pandemic. We didn't have any excess deaths
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:44.680]  from this terrible thing that was supposed to kill us all until the alleged vaccines were
[02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:50.600]  injected into people. And then the deaths started accelerating, as we know, and the disabilities. So
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:56.760]  they've done that. And I think the next thing that they think they can ride, because they're
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:02:04.280]  always looking for the next racehorse that they can push across the finish line. I think the next
[02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:08.680]  horse that they're going to ride is one that they're gearing up on right now, and that's
[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:15.640]  climate change. The one after that, I predict will be food shortages, because with the food
[02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:25.960]  shortages, they'll be able to corral people into their centers. Come to our 15 minute cities,
[02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:31.240]  come to our 10 minute cities, come to our urban concentration camps, our dog kennels,
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:39.160]  where we will feed you and we will take care of you. And yes, you won't have steak. And by the
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:46.920]  way, the German government, I believe yesterday, issued a directive to people to eat no more than
[02:02:46.920 --> 02:02:54.920]  10 grams of protein per day. Well, you can't maintain a healthy body on 10 grams of protein.
[02:02:55.800 --> 02:03:01.320]  Whether you get it from an animal source or a vegetable source, 10 grams of protein is simply
[02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:06.280]  not adequate for health. But that's what they want. The sicker you are, the more needy you are,
[02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:13.000]  the more controllable you are. And therefore, if they give you synthetic meat, if they give you
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:18.200]  insects, if they give you whatever it is that they tell you will support your life and your health
[02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:25.080]  and be good for you, or just keep you alive, even if it's not good for you, you'll eat it.
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:31.080]  And you'll eat it living in their cities. And you'll do what they say, because your credit
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:38.200]  score will go down if you don't do what they say. And if your credit score goes down, you can't get
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:43.240]  even bugs to eat. And what's incredible, we've got to go to break for one minute and join some
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:49.000]  stations, but we don't have to wait anymore with you and, you know, General Stolbein warning us 20
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:54.600]  years ago. It's all here now. It's all fabulously evil, fabulously ridiculous, just out in the open.
[02:03:55.160 --> 02:04:01.640]  And we can stop it. And that's the important part, Alex, not what they're going to do,
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:07.720]  not what they have done. But the fact that we, you and I, and every listener here and everybody
[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:17.640]  that they know, actually has the power to stop this disastrous plan now before it goes one step
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:23.160]  further. Everybody's got a bookmarket and share it preventgenocide2030.org. And I meant to get her
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:27.640]  when she was on a few months ago, the next week, time flew by. We didn't do it. I'll come in
[02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:33.240]  Saturday if she can do it from like noon to two, do two hours commercial free. The crew, noon,
[02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:37.640]  Saturday, two hours commercial free. She sends it all over. No breaks. She'll be able to go over
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:41.960]  it all. Might take one five minute break. We go to the bathroom or something, but we'll do Saturday
[02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:47.640]  noon to 2 p.m. Central with her. We got 30 more minutes left with Dr. Rima Labo. Then Dr. Darren
[02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:52.440]  Beattie pops in about the big developments with the Fed provocateurs and all the rest of the stuff
[02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:56.680]  on January 6th, the big Ray Epps developments. We'll be right back in 60 seconds. Stay with us.
[02:04:58.920 --> 02:05:04.120]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G or
[02:05:04.120 --> 02:05:10.200]  the GMO crops. They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies
[02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:16.520]  and industry to use. One of the top pesticides used is atrazine. The allowable level the
[02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:21.080]  government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically
[02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:27.000]  turn your son into a feminized mutant. Look it up. Don't let them do this to your family. We have
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:32.440]  the very best gravity-fed filter system out there. Highest rated at half the price of leading
[02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:36.920]  competitors. The Alexa Pure ready to ship to you right now. We have replacement filters for folks
[02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:41.000]  who have already gotten it. It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them. It is amazing. It's great
[02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:46.040]  for your home, your business. You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water. Almost everything
[02:05:46.040 --> 02:05:50.360]  is contaminated. This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist
[02:05:50.360 --> 02:05:54.920]  onslaught. Get yours today at Infoworkstore.com for a limited time. We're running a 10% discount.
[02:05:54.920 --> 02:05:58.200]  That is a huge discount. It's probably the lowest price out there. You need this filter.
[02:06:02.200 --> 02:06:07.800]  You found it. The tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:10.360 --> 02:06:13.560]  All right. Dr. Rima Lambo is one of the smartest people we've ever interviewed
[02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:19.160]  and she's so on target. She's so accurate and she's so desperate. I would use the word I am too
[02:06:19.160 --> 02:06:23.480]  to warn you that we'd stop this together. Plus, we're really starting to get the initiative and
[02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:29.160]  barely winning, I would say. But I'm going to let you host here because if I interrupt any,
[02:06:29.960 --> 02:06:33.640]  I'm going to just start talking because everything you say, I'm going to write notes.
[02:06:33.640 --> 02:06:36.680]  I'm going to sit here and turn my mic off and write notes for at least 10 minutes,
[02:06:36.680 --> 02:06:41.320]  15 minutes, give you the floor to host here and run through all this and talk about the scenarios
[02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:46.520]  and the admitted UN documents you sent us and how nightmarish this is. But studying the eugenicists
[02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:53.320]  going back to the mid 1850s and before that and doing your research on how they never break ranks.
[02:06:53.320 --> 02:07:00.680]  They always push the same agenda. It's so anti-human. It's just so satanic. I know you get
[02:07:00.680 --> 02:07:05.240]  into documents and science and all of it, but at the end of the day, what is it? It does seem like
[02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:12.520]  there's some outside inhuman force driving these people where they go against their own self-interest.
[02:07:12.520 --> 02:07:16.680]  So speak to that and then recap what you've said, get into the rest of it. And I mean,
[02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:20.680]  what we're facing, because this isn't like, oh, we better fight tyranny or our children will be
[02:07:20.680 --> 02:07:25.640]  slaves. We're going to be slaves. We are slaves. They're shutting down thousands of farms in
[02:07:25.640 --> 02:07:31.400]  Netherlands, thousands in Ireland. Who cares about the Netherlands? Third biggest food producer.
[02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:37.400]  They're collapsing the third world. I mean, they are involved in shutting off nitrogen fertilizer.
[02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:42.360]  So already they put into function things that is going to kill hundreds of millions
[02:07:42.360 --> 02:07:45.960]  conservatively. And that's what they've currently put into function. And then they're going to blame
[02:07:45.960 --> 02:07:51.000]  it on global warming and us as society breaks down when they're the ones as the managers.
[02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:56.760]  How do they think they'll get away with it? It's just it's it's wild. So break it down for us.
[02:07:57.880 --> 02:08:02.840]  You know, during the break, Alex, I was thinking that we needed to segue into hate.
[02:08:02.840 --> 02:08:09.480]  We need to talk about hate. And that is a large part of the answer to the question that you just
[02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:16.120]  asked. We are being manipulated and maneuver to hate one another and to have no common agenda
[02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:22.760]  with one another while the globalists put out something that they call our common agenda,
[02:08:22.760 --> 02:08:27.640]  which is to destroy all of us and to enslave us from the genetic level outward.
[02:08:27.640 --> 02:08:36.600]  So one of the best techniques that dictators have always used is to have an external enemy.
[02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:43.720]  And if you can make the external enemy external to your tiny little group, then everybody is
[02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:51.560]  your enemy. So right now in California, there is a measure before the legislature to sentence people
[02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:58.680]  differently based on whether they are black or not black. And I assume that people who are brown
[02:08:58.680 --> 02:09:05.160]  will be classed with people who are black, but maybe not so that a white person would get a more
[02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:12.280]  extensive time in jail than a black person for the same crime. Well, what do you think that's
[02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:21.000]  going to do to the relations between black and white people? Nothing good. A reparations
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:27.880]  is being considered so that black people will get five million dollars each from the state of
[02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:38.680]  California for being something or other. And this is insane. We're talking about making sure that
[02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:48.360]  society is a place where it's dangerous to be and then helping people by propaganda to hate somebody
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:54.040]  and hold them responsible. Not the globalists, of course, not the people who are destroying the
[02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:59.960]  judicial system and destroying the educational system and destroying the food system and
[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:07.080]  destroying the social cohesion, destroying the civil rights that we all work for, perverting
[02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:15.960]  every concept like sustainability, like human rights, perverting justice, perverting safety,
[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:23.960]  perverting the common good. And that's what they're doing. But they're doing it by accelerating our
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:31.400]  hatred for one another, making the group smaller and smaller. Anti-Semitism is very much on the
[02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:38.840]  rise because they want it to be on the rise. Anti-racist feeling. A woman was interviewed
[02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:46.760]  recently in a video clip that I saw a black woman saying, I am a racist. It is a crime to be white.
[02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:51.800]  Well, of course, that's crazy, but it's the same craziness as it's a crime to be black. It's a
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:56.920]  crime to be Christian. It's a crime to be Jewish. It's a crime to be Hindu. I will remind you that
[02:10:56.920 --> 02:11:06.760]  when India was released from British control, there was a mass slaughter in which 30 million
[02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:13.640]  people died because they were either Hindu and should have been Muslim, or they were Muslim
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:18.760]  and should have been Hindu. And so Indians were killing Indians. And how do you think the British
[02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:27.160]  conquistadors felt about that? They were perfectly happy because it weakened India so much
[02:11:27.160 --> 02:11:35.240]  that it was easier to get control back in many, many nefarious and subversive ways.
[02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:42.680]  Now that's happening to us. And each of us has a responsibility to say, no, I will not hate.
[02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:51.960]  I will not see racism or racial divides as the issue that determines how I feel about anyone
[02:11:51.960 --> 02:12:00.120]  or policies that are acceptable to me. I will not be a racist, a sexist, a religiousist,
[02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:07.560]  an isist. I will be a human being who sees others based on their humanity,
[02:12:07.560 --> 02:12:15.000]  because fundamentally, these globalists see us based on our utility, not on that need.
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:21.320]  Those two children are correct. Those two children should be the leaders for our future
[02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:28.120]  and should lead us into that kind of joyful collaboration with other people, because we
[02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:34.440]  have so much in common, not making enemies of them, because making enemies of them
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:42.840]  puts us under the thumb of these monsters. You asked, is there an outside influence? I don't know.
[02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:51.720]  I was at a very pleasant lunch recently with a guy who is the head salesman for transcranial
[02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:59.080]  stimulation devices, which is a non-pharmaceutical method of treating OCD and schizophrenia and
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:05.800]  addictions and a whole bunch of other things. And anything that's non-pharmaceutical is
[02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:13.160]  good with me. So he was there and also the owner of about 65 clinics that use this technology.
[02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:20.520]  And he said, you know who's responsible for all of this globalist stuff that's going on?
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:27.720]  I said, no, who's responsible? He said, Satan. I said, well, maybe. I don't have any documentation
[02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:32.920]  that that's so. I know that you believe it. He has a religious belief that tells him that.
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:39.320]  But he was absolutely confident. And I said, well, for me, I make a distinction between what I believe
[02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:45.560]  and what I know. These activities, that's a very, very powerful graphic. These activities
[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:51.800]  certainly are evil. That much I know. Whether there's a reptilian component,
[02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:59.560]  I'm looking for evidence for that. I haven't seen any. Whether it's an actual physical Satan,
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:05.400]  I don't know. I'm looking for evidence. I haven't seen that either. But that's not relevant to me.
[02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:13.080]  What's relevant is what is actually happening, what is actually planned and what we can actually do
[02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:21.800]  to stop it. And what that is, as far as I'm concerned, is we use this, the Freedom Mouse.
[02:14:21.800 --> 02:14:28.680]  We ride the Freedom Mouse. They gave us the Internet to control us. Well, that's not working
[02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:34.520]  so well for them. They're trying. One of the things that is a goal for these globalists is
[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:43.480]  to control all communication, to prevent any kind of infodemic, which means wrong think.
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:50.680]  And wrong think means saying the truth that they don't like, or even saying something that's wrong
[02:14:50.680 --> 02:14:57.240]  that they don't like. But it's saying what we believe in saying, what we need to say.
[02:14:57.240 --> 02:15:06.360]  Now, if you go to preventgenocide2030.org, you will see that there is a place for you to click,
[02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:15.880]  to take action. And that action is to bombard your lawmakers with your demand, not your request,
[02:15:15.880 --> 02:15:24.680]  but your demand that we get our country out of the UN and out of WHO. Now, Alex,
[02:15:24.680 --> 02:15:31.480]  I have to tell you I made a mistake. I thought, and I'm a very big fan of Sun Tzu and strategic
[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:37.320]  analysis. I learned a lot about that from General Burt, who was, as you know, a brilliant strategic
[02:15:37.320 --> 02:15:48.120]  analyst. And I thought that our strategy needed to be to get out of WHO and then get out of the
[02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:55.080]  controlling organization behind it, the UN. And then I became aware of the summit for the future
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:16:02.120]  scheduled for September 2024 and the pact for the future and the documents that we've been
[02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:07.000]  talking about today. Well, let me just get where you're going. I mean, if you look at right now,
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:13.400]  it's Biden's head of the COVID response is actually running the whole UN treaty. So it's
[02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:17.800]  all coming out of the US, just like the UN came out of the US. So even if he got out of the UN
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:22.600]  and got out of the WHO, it's still the corporations, bureaucracies are the ones calling the shots.
[02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:29.720]  The UN is just the front group. Absolutely. It's just a front group. First, we have the WHO. And
[02:16:29.720 --> 02:16:35.080]  behind that, we have the UN. And behind that, we have the financial system. And then above that,
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:40.760]  there are the guys who are trying to take the world apart. And whether that's satanic or not,
[02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:49.640]  I don't know. But the point is that we have the power right now to force our countries out of
[02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:58.040]  half of that four phase system. One half. That's WHO. Well, if we stop the WHO treaty,
[02:16:58.040 --> 02:17:01.800]  they won't have the agreement to put the power and attack us. So that's where the rubber meets
[02:17:01.800 --> 02:17:08.360]  the road. So we politically blow that up. And the only way we can politically blow that up
[02:17:08.360 --> 02:17:14.680]  is to force the spineless, gutless, worthless people who are the gatekeepers,
[02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:21.880]  they're called politicians, to shorten it, to force them to do our will. And that means
[02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:28.360]  showing them what our will is through a massive display of demand. And that's why at Prevent
[02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:34.520]  Genocide 2030, we have letters for the UK, we have letters for the US, we have letters for
[02:17:34.520 --> 02:17:37.720]  Canada, we have letters for lots of countries. No, it's beautiful. If people pick up on your
[02:17:37.720 --> 02:17:42.600]  expert analysis, it'll be that much stronger. And what you're saying is true at the UN, at the
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:47.000]  IMF, at the World Bank, at the CIA, at the Carnegie Endowment. They are in Rockefeller
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:51.640]  Foundation. They're in full panic. Here's an article today about Daily Skeptic on Infowars.com.
[02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:57.320]  EU Commissioner Thierry Brinton warned social media companies to turn up the dial on censorship
[02:17:57.320 --> 02:18:02.040]  or else he's trying to basically arrest Elon Musk. Now, I don't lionize Musk and think he's perfect.
[02:18:02.760 --> 02:18:07.560]  I think he's kind of a, you know, middle road alternative they've created. But they're actually
[02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:11.400]  trying to go after him criminally. Because I can tell you, there's a lot less censorship on Twitter
[02:18:11.400 --> 02:18:15.400]  than anywhere else. What do you make of this? But you're right, they're hitting the panic button,
[02:18:15.400 --> 02:18:23.560]  admitting they're losing. They are terrified. Because they're they're really very expensive
[02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:29.400]  and extensive attempts at completely controlling our thought. Because what's the narrative about
[02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:36.600]  the narrative is to control our wetware. It's to make us compliant with their lies.
[02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:42.680]  And that's failed. And that's failing even more rapidly. And when it fails, it tends to backlash.
[02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:47.560]  And they're getting a sustained cultural, spiritual, intellectual backlash that is
[02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:52.200]  incalculable. I mean, look at like, most of the mainline comics are coming out against him now.
[02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:56.440]  Most of the Hollywood stars are coming out against him. All these other bigwigs are coming out
[02:18:56.440 --> 02:18:59.960]  against him. I mean, just because they see which way the wind's blowing. So I think we've reached
[02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:04.120]  a critical mass here. But like you said, the enemy is going to pull something big.
[02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:10.920]  Yet the enemy is going to pull something big and what they're remember, now that there is a huge
[02:19:10.920 --> 02:19:19.000]  accelerating opposition to the narrative in its specifics and in general, what they will do is
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:25.880]  penetrate that opposition and start and not start and continue trying to control it and spin it in
[02:19:25.880 --> 02:19:32.280]  their direction. So instead of a bandwagon, it's a steer wagon. Exactly. A steer wagon, precisely.
[02:19:33.400 --> 02:19:42.200]  We have the opportunity at this point to completely destroy their ability to implement
[02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:50.760]  Agenda 2030. Agenda 2030 is the end of everything that we value. Everything. There is no area that
[02:19:50.760 --> 02:19:59.960]  they have left unscathed. Now, Agenda 2030 is bad enough. But behind that is this pact for the
[02:19:59.960 --> 02:20:10.920]  future, which simply explicitly expands the control so that there is not an atom left out of
[02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:15.880]  their control. That's the build back better. Whoever's left holding the pieces in these
[02:20:15.880 --> 02:20:21.160]  citadels, these globalist systems, then divide up the spoils of the world in this new dystopia.
[02:20:21.160 --> 02:20:28.760]  That's their reset, build back better on our bones. Well, the term that the head of state
[02:20:28.760 --> 02:20:36.360]  that I've spoken about, who clued me into this back in 2002, 2003, the term that she used was the
[02:20:36.360 --> 02:20:43.960]  neo-feudal era. And she was very specific. There will be us, the neo-feudalists at the top.
[02:20:45.240 --> 02:20:51.640]  And below that, us will be our servants and servitors. And below them, our technicians.
[02:20:51.640 --> 02:20:57.560]  And that requires only 10% of the world's current population. Everyone else is superfluous.
[02:20:57.560 --> 02:21:02.920]  And Yuval Harari, not long ago, said virtually the same thing. The word for word says what you said
[02:21:02.920 --> 02:21:10.520]  20 years ago on my show. Exactly. And so 20 years ago, we could have stopped this really easily.
[02:21:10.520 --> 02:21:14.280]  But 20 years ago, when I said it, when General Byrd said it, when you said it,
[02:21:14.280 --> 02:21:23.480]  we were labeled as lunatics. 20 years ago, when you learned this, exactly 20 years ago, like 2003.
[02:21:24.200 --> 02:21:27.080]  And then you warned of it all, and then here it is.
[02:21:28.920 --> 02:21:37.880]  And we were labeled as lunatics because we were genocide. But now, there is lunacy afoot.
[02:21:38.840 --> 02:21:45.640]  And the lunacy is all on their side. So the sanity is, oh, look at what's happening,
[02:21:45.640 --> 02:21:50.520]  look at their documents, look at their actions, and stop it.
[02:21:50.520 --> 02:21:54.360]  Well, let's talk about basic psychology, since you are a psychiatrist, amongst other things.
[02:21:54.360 --> 02:21:57.880]  Isn't that the classic thing of the madness of elites? Like they have this master plan,
[02:21:57.880 --> 02:22:01.960]  they're going to make us perfect. We're the bad guys, but they're really projecting
[02:22:01.960 --> 02:22:07.320]  their hate onto us. But then every time they're about to get full control, they all go nuts.
[02:22:07.320 --> 02:22:11.400]  You study history. As soon as some elite tries to control everybody, they go crazy.
[02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:17.160]  Well, they are crazy, or they wouldn't try to control everybody. They start out crazy.
[02:22:17.640 --> 02:22:20.200]  Normal people don't try to control everybody. So they get crazier, though.
[02:22:21.080 --> 02:22:27.880]  They get crazier. As we know, what happens when people get powerful is that they want to get more
[02:22:27.880 --> 02:22:37.160]  powerful. And if their power means to debase, demean, and destroy everything around them,
[02:22:37.160 --> 02:22:41.960]  then that becomes more and more reasonable position. And let me tell you something that
[02:22:41.960 --> 02:22:49.960]  I know as a psychiatrist and a psychoanalyst. I have sat with a lot of people who have done a lot
[02:22:49.960 --> 02:22:57.880]  of, to me, awful things. And that includes parents, and it includes spouses, and it includes
[02:22:57.880 --> 02:23:05.960]  politicians and heads of state. And the interesting thing is that everybody has a because. Everybody
[02:23:05.960 --> 02:23:13.880]  has a rationalization why it was okay to tie their kid to a radiator in the middle of winter
[02:23:13.880 --> 02:23:20.520]  and beat the kid with an electric cord until they were dead. They always have a because.
[02:23:20.520 --> 02:23:26.520]  Well, I was trying to keep them from going to hell because there was a demon in the child,
[02:23:26.520 --> 02:23:32.280]  or whatever. No matter how crazy it is, it makes sense to them. So the fact that these people are
[02:23:32.280 --> 02:23:39.240]  crazy, the fact that those who wish to be dictators start out crazy, or they wouldn't want to be
[02:23:39.240 --> 02:23:46.200]  dictators, is irrelevant. And let me tell you about a group of people that I was asked to meet with
[02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:53.160]  recently. A group of really good people. Yes, that's a very important graphic. A group of very
[02:23:53.960 --> 02:24:01.400]  good-hearted people have decided, as a number of others have, that they need to replace the WHO.
[02:24:02.040 --> 02:24:08.840]  These are medical people and epidemiologists and scientists from around the world. And the WHO is
[02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:15.720]  bad, so we're going to be the better, kinder, gentler WHO. And I said to them, wait a minute,
[02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:22.520]  we don't need no stinking WHO. We need collaboration, not central control. We never
[02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:29.880]  need central control. And you're using the same model. So it's basically just regulatory capture.
[02:24:29.880 --> 02:24:35.400]  You're going to be the WHO, and you're going to decide what's good and what's bad. And when
[02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:39.960]  somebody violates what you think is good, you're going to squash them. We should have medical
[02:24:39.960 --> 02:24:43.160]  freedom, and then people can make their own decisions. That creates a free market and
[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:50.040]  accelerates renaissance. Exactly. Accelerates renaissance. Now, every dictator, every dictatorial
[02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:56.760]  system decides that it can improve humanity. That we're going to perfect humanity. We're going to
[02:24:56.760 --> 02:25:03.400]  make the new man. Marxism wants to make the new man. Democracy fanatics want to remake the new
[02:25:03.400 --> 02:25:07.560]  man. Hitler was going to create the ubermenschen. Hitler was going to create the ubermenschen.
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:14.680]  We don't need no stinking new man. What we need is for humanity to be treated humanely.
[02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:21.160]  And then humanity is a good man or woman. And we've forgotten that, politically speaking. We've
[02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:27.880]  forgotten that in terms of sociology. And speaking of sociology and stupidity, there is a
[02:25:27.880 --> 02:25:33.560]  new area in obstetrics and gynecology. It is devoted to the pregnancy of transgender men.
[02:25:34.440 --> 02:25:42.200]  Say what? It is devoted to the pregnancy needs, the reproductive rights of transgender men. Well,
[02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:50.120]  let's start out with the fact that transgender is a delusion. So it's a church of insanity,
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:54.040]  a church of being at war with science. What is the master plan behind that?
[02:25:54.040 --> 02:26:01.640]  Just standardizing total insanity? It's normalizing insanity. It's not standardizing
[02:26:01.640 --> 02:26:07.400]  it. It's normalizing it so that anything can be presented as a... It's animal farm. You're right.
[02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:12.760]  It's the opposite. I was saying standardizing to create... You're right. It's total Pandora's
[02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:17.800]  box of insanity. It's anything the state says becomes true.
[02:26:20.040 --> 02:26:25.960]  That's what it is. And we, as sane people, when something inside you says, wait a minute, wait,
[02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:30.680]  what? That's not right. That doesn't make any sense at all. Chances are it doesn't make any
[02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:36.280]  sense at all. And if you... Exactly. And if you go along with it, then you have allowed yourself
[02:26:36.280 --> 02:26:40.920]  to be deflected from being sane. But it's such an assault on women. I mean, they're so worried
[02:26:40.920 --> 02:26:45.000]  about women. Look, it's not about kissing women's ass. We're all the same species. I don't even see
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:50.600]  us as separate. We're all made by... But the point is, the attacks clearly on women and children,
[02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:54.760]  because men are supposed to defend and die for women and children. It's an attack on the species
[02:26:54.760 --> 02:27:00.920]  itself. It's so naked. It's so obvious. The entire comprehensive sexuality
[02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:08.280]  education program, and I'll send you the UN PowerPoint that we can talk about on Saturday,
[02:27:08.280 --> 02:27:16.840]  Alex. I'll send that to Daria, your excellent producer. That entire assault on humanity and
[02:27:16.840 --> 02:27:26.440]  on decency and on sexuality and reality says that it's designed to protect girls and women.
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:34.440]  But it's not. It's designed to destroy girls and women and boys and men and human beings
[02:27:34.520 --> 02:27:41.320]  altogether. However, everything that the globalists say, everything that the governmentalists say,
[02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:46.520]  the would-be rulers say, has to be inverted because it's all... I've noticed that's their
[02:27:46.520 --> 02:27:50.360]  greatest weakness. If you simply flip it, it's what's going on. It's so easy. All right. We got
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:55.880]  to talk to you on Saturday, noon to 2 p.m. Central. Thank you, Dr. Rima Labo. You'll have the floor.
[02:27:55.880 --> 02:27:58.840]  It says all the documents. You can do a whole PowerPoint. You can go through everything. You'll
[02:27:58.840 --> 02:28:04.760]  have the floor. I'll just be there to kind of be the usher. Preventgenocide2030.org.
[02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:09.960]  Preventgenocide2030.org. Everybody, check it out. Share it. Incredible job. Everybody needs
[02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:13.800]  to interview you. I know you've already done a lot of interviews, but please come on our other shows
[02:28:13.800 --> 02:28:18.120]  and please, everybody out there, interview this lady. Thank you so much. Look forward to talking
[02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:23.640]  to you again soon. Thank you, Alex. Ellie knows what she's talking about, folks. It's on.
[02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:28.280]  All right. We got this Ray Epps news that's really scaring the deep state.
[02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:32.680]  And so that's coming up in just a minute. And please remember, I didn't even plug last hour.
[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:37.160]  We need funds. We got great products you already need. You want us to fight the new

[02:28:57.640 --> 02:29:01.560]  The globalists are only humans. Yeah, they have control of the central banks,
[02:29:01.560 --> 02:29:05.320]  they have a lot of power, but they can be defeated. But some of their operations are

[02:31:18.200 --> 02:31:26.200]  find in stores. It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew. Both of these have known documented natural
[02:31:26.200 --> 02:31:32.920]  compounds to lower pain and to also make your nerves healthier which is one of the major reasons
[02:31:32.920 --> 02:31:38.760]  nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain. There's major research behind this all.
[02:31:38.760 --> 02:31:46.040]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from Infowars MD and Nerve Renew from Infowars MD exclusively
[02:31:46.040 --> 02:31:52.520]  at Infowarsstore.com right now. Introducing them both, 25% off. You'll find them exclusively

[02:31:57.240 --> 02:32:04.600]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth and they've got our children
[02:32:04.600 --> 02:32:10.920]  drinking that. This is a psychotic death cult. Period. Case closed. Out to get you and your
[02:32:10.920 --> 02:32:16.760]  family. We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the My Patron Supply Ready Hour group. It's been
[02:32:16.760 --> 02:32:21.000]  around about 15 years. Became the biggest company in the last six. They went out, hired engineers,
[02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:25.720]  reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price
[02:32:25.720 --> 02:32:31.400]  and they made it as good in all the studies. It reduces things to non-detectable levels,
[02:32:31.400 --> 02:32:35.160]  thousands of chemicals. But you can go paint two or three times. There's four or five other filters
[02:32:35.160 --> 02:32:40.280]  out there that are just as good. We sell the very best highest grade water filtration system
[02:32:40.280 --> 02:32:46.520]  for half the price of leading competitor and the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you
[02:32:46.520 --> 02:32:49.720]  you should filter your water. You should also filter your shower water. That's another way
[02:32:49.720 --> 02:32:53.960]  you absorb this crap. But I'm done talking about that. The point is you get the filters
[02:32:53.960 --> 02:32:56.920]  at m4store.com. They're discounted right now. Finally back in stock.
[02:32:58.840 --> 02:33:06.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:06.620 --> 02:33:26.460]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[02:33:26.460 --> 02:33:27.460]  the InfoWar.
[02:33:27.460 --> 02:33:38.700]  Dr. Professor, former Trump advisor, Darren Beatty joins us, and I appreciate him moving
[02:33:38.700 --> 02:33:44.660]  stuff around to get on with us today, because this just broke last night and this morning.
[02:33:44.660 --> 02:33:54.740]  Within hours of the disgraced FBI head, Christopher Wray, getting up there and testifying that
[02:33:54.740 --> 02:33:59.340]  he knew nothing about Ray Epps, and members of Congress showing him saying go into the
[02:33:59.340 --> 02:34:04.100]  Capitol, showing him saying he orchestrated it, showing him charging him when they breached
[02:34:04.100 --> 02:34:12.340]  the first barrier, suddenly there's a lawsuit filed against Fox News by Ray Epps' lawyers,
[02:34:12.340 --> 02:34:16.780]  and they say, oh, we've been told we're about to be criminally charged, it's Tucker Carlson's
[02:34:16.780 --> 02:34:23.380]  fault. And then, oh, it's terrible, Tucker, they say in the lawsuit, says we instigated.
[02:34:23.380 --> 02:34:28.580]  No, no, instigating is like you push something. Orchestrating, in his own words, is when you're
[02:34:28.580 --> 02:34:34.700]  running it. You're in command. Like a top general orchestrates something, or a college
[02:34:34.700 --> 02:34:40.380]  football coach, when they coach the game, they're the orchestra, the quarterback executes.
[02:34:40.380 --> 02:34:46.700]  You could say, I guess, a running back instigates. So, I don't see what they'll do is they'll
[02:34:46.700 --> 02:34:51.420]  get a rigged jury, folks. They go into special areas, special juries, D.C., other areas,
[02:34:51.420 --> 02:34:55.420]  and then they just, they only put on evidence, and it doesn't matter. They can send a newborn
[02:34:55.420 --> 02:35:02.180]  baby to the firing squad in District of Criminals. But a lot of movement, they're really panicked
[02:35:02.180 --> 02:35:08.820]  on this. Why is this moving so fast right now? And we saw Congressman Nails really just
[02:35:08.820 --> 02:35:14.580]  tear up, along with other congresspeople, the FBI director, and then again, play the
[02:35:14.580 --> 02:35:19.980]  clip. But again, let's move on from Strzoka, because the congressman says, well, Strzoka
[02:35:19.980 --> 02:35:24.140]  did as much as Epps. No, Strzoka didn't run around for days before saying break in. He
[02:35:24.140 --> 02:35:30.060]  didn't ram signs into people. He didn't say he orchestrated it in text messages. He just
[02:35:30.060 --> 02:35:35.340]  got excited and went, go, go, go. Well, let's move Strzoka aside. My Owen Troyer, my good
[02:35:35.340 --> 02:35:41.420]  friend I've known eight years, who I love, seven and a half years, been here seven years.
[02:35:41.420 --> 02:35:47.240]  Owen has no criminal record, a beautiful, great, hardworking guy, a good Christian man,
[02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:51.080]  and he's there with me and tries to stop people going in and tells people don't go in the
[02:35:51.080 --> 02:35:57.800]  Capitol. He's facing years in prison. And then I got to hear how Ray Epps is this little
[02:35:57.800 --> 02:36:03.040]  poor darling in the New York Times. They are so scared. Ray Epps is the thing, like in
[02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:07.080]  the Jenga game or Janga or whatever it is, where you pull the piece of wood and the whole
[02:36:07.080 --> 02:36:12.980]  thing comes down, or it's the card in the house of cards.
[02:36:12.980 --> 02:36:20.540]  So I want to go to Dr. Beattie here to talk about this and how big this is, but first
[02:36:20.540 --> 02:36:26.440]  I want to play this short clip, very short clip, just from Congress yesterday of them
[02:36:26.440 --> 02:36:34.100]  actually showing the FBI director a small piece of what Mr. Epps is on video doing.
[02:36:34.100 --> 02:36:38.180]  And Mr. Ray Epps can be seen at the first breach of Capitol grounds at approximately
[02:36:38.180 --> 02:36:40.180]  1250 p.m. Play the clip, please.
[02:37:08.180 --> 02:37:36.220]  Within an hour, the lawsuit's filed saying he's going to be indicted. I don't know that's
[02:37:36.220 --> 02:37:41.860]  even true. But they don't even show him ramming the sign in, because I guess that just gets
[02:37:41.860 --> 02:37:47.140]  too complex for people. Dr. Beattie, thanks for joining us on short notice, revolver.news,
[02:37:47.140 --> 02:37:52.020]  with the great work you do over there. But wow, I mean, everybody seeing this is beyond
[02:37:52.020 --> 02:37:57.060]  vindication that this is in Congress. And how are they indicting hundreds of people
[02:37:57.060 --> 02:38:02.020]  that didn't even enter the Capitol and putting them in jail like our own reporters? One of
[02:38:02.020 --> 02:38:08.260]  our other reporters has been given a conviction for just being there. This is preposterous.
[02:38:08.260 --> 02:38:18.500]  First of all, it's really a thrill to be back. It's been a long time, as I'm very glad that I'm
[02:38:18.500 --> 02:38:24.940]  back here to discuss a critically important development in the January 6th saga, the Fed
[02:38:24.940 --> 02:38:33.380]  surrection saga. Because notwithstanding the imminent likelihood of a defamation suit against
[02:38:33.380 --> 02:38:40.580]  myself, I will maintain as I have that Ray Epps is a smoking gun of the Fed's erection. And what do
[02:38:40.580 --> 02:38:46.940]  I mean by that? Well, we've seen the video clip that Congressman Nell played, which incidentally
[02:38:47.100 --> 02:38:53.460]  comes from revolver.news. That's our clip. It's been seen by tens of millions of people now. But
[02:38:53.460 --> 02:39:00.900]  it kind of speaks for itself. Here is an individual wearing a Trump hat in Canada.
[02:39:03.870 --> 02:39:07.870]  ...
[02:39:07.870 --> 02:39:15.870]  ...repeatedly demanding that the crowd go into the Capitol, not to, into the Capitol,
[02:39:15.870 --> 02:39:22.870]  and acknowledging his understanding that that would be illegal by prefacing every exhortation of that sort by saying,
[02:39:22.870 --> 02:39:26.870]  I'll probably go to jail for this. I'll probably get arrested for this.
[02:39:27.870 --> 02:39:34.870]  The only thing is, despite having his behavior so egregious that he was one of the first 20 people
[02:39:34.870 --> 02:39:38.870]  placed on the FBI's most wanted list in relation to January 6th,
[02:39:38.870 --> 02:39:43.870]  despite being a January 6th participant whose behavior was so egregious,
[02:39:43.870 --> 02:39:50.870]  that video of Epps was prominently featured in the New York Times'
[02:39:50.870 --> 02:39:57.870]  ominously titled documentary feature on January 6th called Day of Rage.
[02:39:57.870 --> 02:39:59.870]  But then everything changed.
[02:40:00.290 --> 02:40:09.410]  Let's do this, Dr. Beattie, stay right there, we're going to reconnect to you, you have
[02:40:09.410 --> 02:40:13.210]  a little bit of Skype problems, let's disconnect, let's reconnect, this is so important what
[02:40:13.210 --> 02:40:17.130]  you're saying, and yes, they're going to sue Dr. Beattie.
[02:40:17.130 --> 02:40:20.890]  And he's totally innocent, all he did was show clips of what someone said, who text
[02:40:20.890 --> 02:40:27.210]  messaged his family, I orchestrated it, I orchestrated it, it's like you get caught at a bank with
[02:40:27.210 --> 02:40:31.930]  money in your hand, and you have a note in your pocket saying, I orchestrated it.
[02:40:31.930 --> 02:40:37.130]  But you understand these juries, these judges will not let any of that to the jury.
[02:40:37.130 --> 02:40:43.210]  And they will say that Dr. Beattie has not given them, they'll first sue him and demand
[02:40:43.210 --> 02:40:44.210]  his discovery.
[02:40:44.210 --> 02:40:48.810]  And they'll say, give us discovery, Dr. Beattie, that you made up these lies, there will be
[02:40:48.810 --> 02:40:51.730]  no discovery he made up lies, he's showing you clips.
[02:40:51.730 --> 02:40:54.810]  The judge will then default him and say, you did not give us the evidence that you
[02:40:54.810 --> 02:41:00.610]  were a liar, jury, he is guilty, no evidence will be put on, no clips of re-apps.
[02:41:00.610 --> 02:41:04.690]  They will then say that Dr. Beattie made a $50 billion off of it, and the jury will
[02:41:04.690 --> 02:41:05.690]  rule $10 billion.
[02:41:05.690 --> 02:41:09.890]  And I'm not trying to, it doesn't matter, he'll get overturned on appeal, but I've experienced
[02:41:09.890 --> 02:41:14.450]  it, ladies and gentlemen, they did the same thing with the Dominion lawsuit.
[02:41:14.450 --> 02:41:22.810]  The judge didn't do an official default, they said, oh, I find you guilty, you lied.
[02:41:22.810 --> 02:41:25.010]  So I'm going to tell the jury you're guilty.
[02:41:25.010 --> 02:41:26.010]  Same thing as a default.
[02:41:26.010 --> 02:41:27.010]  I'm going to shut up now.
[02:41:27.010 --> 02:41:30.570]  You were making great points, only cut up a little bit, so I reconnected.
[02:41:30.570 --> 02:41:31.570]  Please continue.
[02:41:31.570 --> 02:41:34.130]  Yeah, I apologize for my connection here.
[02:41:34.130 --> 02:41:39.850]  But I was just setting it up to say that we've all seen how egregious his behavior is.
[02:41:39.850 --> 02:41:45.890]  The New York Times featured him prominently in a segment called Day of Rage, precisely
[02:41:45.890 --> 02:41:48.370]  because his behavior was so egregious.
[02:41:48.370 --> 02:41:54.370]  He was one of the first people named in the top 20 of the FBI's most wanted list in relation
[02:41:54.370 --> 02:41:55.370]  to January 6th.
[02:41:55.370 --> 02:41:58.770]  But then everything changed suddenly.
[02:41:58.770 --> 02:42:07.450]  And conveniently, everything changed shortly after Revolver News created a national conversation
[02:42:07.450 --> 02:42:12.810]  pertaining to the possibility of federal involvement in January 6th.
[02:42:12.810 --> 02:42:18.330]  Then Epps' name was quietly taken off of the FBI's most wanted list.
[02:42:18.330 --> 02:42:23.890]  Then the New York Times, which previously had featured Epps as a key figure in their
[02:42:23.890 --> 02:42:31.850]  Day of Rage documentary, does a fully dedicated puff piece on Epps that doesn't explore or
[02:42:31.850 --> 02:42:39.370]  address any of the common sense questions or suspicions that arise as a result of just
[02:42:39.370 --> 02:42:42.050]  seeing what his behavior was.
[02:42:42.050 --> 02:42:47.770]  Then we have a 60 Minutes segment that was unbelievably sympathetic.
[02:42:47.770 --> 02:42:52.770]  And a 60 Minutes producer who incidentally led me on saying that he would have me on
[02:42:52.770 --> 02:42:55.570]  to address the alternative view.
[02:42:55.570 --> 02:43:11.650]  And they thought the alternative view is so devastating for Epps that they wouldn't even
[02:43:11.650 --> 02:43:14.570]  have me on because it would be too dangerous.
[02:43:14.570 --> 02:43:21.050]  And also Adam Kinzinger, a man who spent a lot of time on all fours, a man who has
[02:43:21.050 --> 02:43:25.810]  never met a January 6th participant he didn't want to see rotting in jail for less than
[02:43:25.810 --> 02:43:26.810]  50 years.
[02:43:26.810 --> 02:43:40.890]  All of a sudden, Adam Kinzinger, it's revealed in the transcripts.
[02:43:40.890 --> 02:43:45.770]  And now to add to the list, the cherry on top of unlikely bedfellows for Epps, former
[02:43:45.770 --> 02:43:50.530]  head of the Arizona Oath Keepers, only guy caught on camera telling people to go into
[02:43:50.530 --> 02:43:56.050]  the Capitol as early as January 5th, the cherry on top is his legal representation.
[02:43:56.050 --> 02:43:59.690]  His lawyer is a guy called Michael Tater.
[02:43:59.690 --> 02:44:01.130]  Who is Michael Tater?
[02:44:01.130 --> 02:44:06.770]  He comes from deep within the bowels of the nexus of the Democrat machine and the national
[02:44:06.770 --> 02:44:08.770]  security establishment.
[02:44:08.770 --> 02:44:15.730]  Is in the employment of notoriously disgraced Democrat hatchet man, David Brock.
[02:44:15.730 --> 02:44:21.090]  He's also formerly an employee of the law firm Perkins Coy, one of the laboratories
[02:44:21.090 --> 02:44:27.330]  out of which the hoax steel dossier was concocted.
[02:44:27.330 --> 02:44:34.450]  These are the people pushing Epps, helping Epps.
[02:44:34.450 --> 02:44:38.370]  Let me ask you this, because you made a lot of great points in your Skype, I think, because
[02:44:38.370 --> 02:44:39.370]  you're not blocking calls.
[02:44:39.370 --> 02:44:40.370]  I can tell what's happening.
[02:44:40.370 --> 02:44:41.370]  I know Skype works.
[02:44:41.370 --> 02:44:44.850]  You're getting call after call after call because people want you on right now and that's
[02:44:44.850 --> 02:44:46.250]  messing it up.
[02:44:46.250 --> 02:44:50.570]  But they've definitely got to be in panic mode because everybody knows close to a thousand
[02:44:50.570 --> 02:44:53.730]  people have been charged, most of them doing far less than Ray Epps.
[02:44:53.730 --> 02:44:55.330]  There's no way they get out of this.
[02:44:55.330 --> 02:44:59.010]  Not suing Fox, not suing Tucker, not suing you.
[02:44:59.010 --> 02:45:04.010]  I mean, I don't see how they ever get around the fact, your Skype's back now, that this
[02:45:04.010 --> 02:45:09.770]  is so blaring and so obvious and that they've not been able to repackage Ray Epps as a
[02:45:09.770 --> 02:45:10.770]  hero.
[02:45:10.770 --> 02:45:16.250]  What about the timing that they filed the lawsuit right after the FBI director got confronted?
[02:45:16.250 --> 02:45:19.930]  Well, I don't know too much about the timing.
[02:45:19.930 --> 02:45:22.970]  I think this has been in the works for a very long time.
[02:45:22.970 --> 02:45:27.770]  In fact, I know it's been in the works for a very long time and I think it's probably
[02:45:27.770 --> 02:45:33.770]  worthwhile to address some of the contextual and strategic questions surrounding the defamation
[02:45:33.770 --> 02:45:35.690]  claim itself.
[02:45:35.690 --> 02:45:41.370]  It's important to note that at the moment, technically speaking, I am not a defendant
[02:45:41.370 --> 02:45:45.410]  in a defamation case and neither is Tucker Carlson.
[02:45:45.410 --> 02:45:50.410]  Fox News is the defendant in this case and I think there's a reason why.
[02:45:50.410 --> 02:45:56.490]  First of all, as you mentioned, Fox News has demonstrated that it is a soft target.
[02:45:56.490 --> 02:46:06.410]  They caved weakly, shamefully, unnecessarily in the Dominion case and agreed to settle
[02:46:06.410 --> 02:46:09.410]  for a number that's close to a billion dollars.
[02:46:09.410 --> 02:46:13.050]  They have a target on their back and it's very clear from the language of the legal
[02:46:13.050 --> 02:46:18.170]  complaint that they're trying to piggyback off of the Dominion precedent in order to
[02:46:18.170 --> 02:46:20.610]  milk more money out of Fox.
[02:46:20.610 --> 02:46:23.850]  Here's why I think Fox will comply.
[02:46:23.850 --> 02:46:26.290]  First of all, they're just soft and weak.
[02:46:26.290 --> 02:46:31.730]  It's a weak corporation, as most American corporations are, if not all.
[02:46:31.730 --> 02:46:36.730]  Secondly, it's in their self-interest to settle this case.
[02:46:36.730 --> 02:46:38.730]  Why, one might ask?
[02:46:38.730 --> 02:46:42.930]  Well, they just fired Tucker Carlson.
[02:46:42.930 --> 02:46:49.970]  By settling this case, they can reinforce the narrative that Tucker Carlson was a liability
[02:46:49.970 --> 02:46:54.210]  for them and therefore they were justified in firing Tucker.
[02:46:54.210 --> 02:46:56.730]  I think their interest is to settle.
[02:46:56.730 --> 02:46:57.730]  Well, exactly.
[02:46:57.730 --> 02:47:02.170]  They want to do it to legitimize January 6th, their false narrative in firing Tucker, but
[02:47:02.170 --> 02:47:03.930]  no one's buying it.
[02:47:03.930 --> 02:47:06.730]  Just like indicting Trump, sending 20 points up.
[02:47:06.730 --> 02:47:10.650]  I mean, this is going to, I think this is going to blow up in their face.
[02:47:10.650 --> 02:47:11.650]  What do you think?
[02:47:11.650 --> 02:47:16.770]  I think even the dumbest DC jury is going to say, no, Fox News, you're right, Fox won't
[02:47:16.770 --> 02:47:20.050]  put a defense on, they'll just roll over.
[02:47:20.050 --> 02:47:21.050]  They'll roll over.
[02:47:21.050 --> 02:47:22.050]  It won't go to a jury.
[02:47:22.050 --> 02:47:27.290]  The other reason is, I think there's a possibility that they wouldn't sue Fox if they thought
[02:47:27.290 --> 02:47:33.010]  that Fox would play hardball and retaliate, you know, taking advantage of the discovery
[02:47:33.010 --> 02:47:36.330]  process, because that could be a vulnerability.
[02:47:36.330 --> 02:47:37.330]  We don't know.
[02:47:37.330 --> 02:47:41.010]  Murdoch doesn't have some buyout for Fox deal, I've been told about for $10 billion, where
[02:47:41.010 --> 02:47:44.850]  he gets paid $3 billion more than it's worth by some big corporation for rolling over to
[02:47:44.850 --> 02:47:45.850]  discredit conservatives.
[02:47:45.850 --> 02:47:47.490]  In fact, I think that's what's going on.
[02:47:47.490 --> 02:47:50.570]  In fact, from my sources, I'm told that is what's going on.
[02:47:50.890 --> 02:47:51.890]  Yeah.
[02:47:51.890 --> 02:47:54.610]  Fox, in my estimation, will cave on this.
[02:47:54.610 --> 02:47:55.890]  It serves their interests.
[02:47:55.890 --> 02:47:57.450]  It serves the regime's interests.
[02:47:57.450 --> 02:48:03.530]  It serves EPSA's interests because EPSA's interested in the new world order.
[02:48:03.530 --> 02:48:07.570]  They want to discredit populism and Tucker Carlson and you and everybody else.
[02:48:07.570 --> 02:48:10.410]  And so that's all this is.
[02:48:10.410 --> 02:48:11.410]  They will settle.
[02:48:11.410 --> 02:48:17.570]  The question is, after that settlement, will EPSA and his team then bring a defamation
[02:48:17.570 --> 02:48:21.930]  case to Revolver News and Tucker in his independent capacity?
[02:48:21.930 --> 02:48:27.410]  I think that's quite likely as well, but the first stop is for them to extract a settlement
[02:48:27.410 --> 02:48:28.410]  out of Fox.
[02:48:28.410 --> 02:48:33.970]  Now, there's an interesting dimension of this that pertains to defamation law and our first
[02:48:33.970 --> 02:48:34.970]  pass.
[02:48:34.970 --> 02:48:41.050]  The definitive first pass analysis of this development is available right now at revolver.news.
[02:48:41.050 --> 02:48:46.530]  We're working on a follow up that addresses this legal specifics of their defamation case,
[02:48:46.530 --> 02:48:48.650]  which is incredibly weak.
[02:48:48.650 --> 02:48:52.410]  And it gets to a core question, which is actually very fascinating.
[02:48:52.410 --> 02:48:59.730]  The whole principle of defamation is predicated on the idea of reputational damage.
[02:48:59.730 --> 02:49:09.890]  Now, it's interesting to ask from a reputational point of view, is it better for EPSA to be
[02:49:09.890 --> 02:49:16.050]  somebody who is an organic participant in what the regime calls the worst domestic terrorist
[02:49:16.050 --> 02:49:21.050]  attack in America since 9-11 or since the Civil War?
[02:49:21.050 --> 02:49:26.330]  Or is it better reputationally for him to have been in the employment or operating at
[02:49:26.330 --> 02:49:30.050]  the direction of the federal government?
[02:49:30.050 --> 02:49:36.450]  I think there's a very strong case to be made that reputationally, it's better to be a fed
[02:49:36.450 --> 02:49:38.730]  than a criminal.
[02:49:38.730 --> 02:49:45.990]  And in fact, there is extensive precedent within defamation laws saying that it's not really
[02:49:46.130 --> 02:49:51.750]  defamation to accuse someone of being fed or informant because, again, incorrectly,
[02:49:51.750 --> 02:49:53.110]  we understand it's incorrect.
[02:49:53.110 --> 02:49:58.710]  But from the standpoint of the legal system, it's not a bad thing to work for the federal
[02:49:58.710 --> 02:50:01.030]  government or to work at their direction.
[02:50:01.030 --> 02:50:02.030]  Oh, obviously.
[02:50:02.030 --> 02:50:03.030]  Yeah.
[02:50:03.030 --> 02:50:04.030]  Yeah.
[02:50:04.030 --> 02:50:05.030]  That's going to get a fair trial.
[02:50:05.030 --> 02:50:06.030]  They're they're putting they're putting all this on fraud.
[02:50:06.030 --> 02:50:09.510]  But but I'm just saying in the court of public opinion, this is going to make reps bigger
[02:50:09.510 --> 02:50:10.510]  than ever.
[02:50:10.510 --> 02:50:14.230]  I mean, they're like even though News Corp, you know, Fox is going to roll over.
[02:50:14.230 --> 02:50:15.590]  That's a blow up in their face.
[02:50:15.590 --> 02:50:20.150]  If they're dumb enough to go after Tucker and you, I mean, if I was you, I'd be like
[02:50:20.150 --> 02:50:22.150]  Brer Rabbit wanting to get thrown in the briar patch.
[02:50:22.150 --> 02:50:27.250]  I mean, that is going to be spectacular if they're dumb enough, which shows how weak
[02:50:27.250 --> 02:50:28.250]  they are on this.
[02:50:28.250 --> 02:50:30.990]  I mean, he's saying I orchestrated the text message.
[02:50:30.990 --> 02:50:32.270]  He's telling him to go in.
[02:50:32.270 --> 02:50:34.270]  He's ramming him with signs.
[02:50:34.270 --> 02:50:36.230]  He's in the first breach.
[02:50:36.230 --> 02:50:40.390]  And then and then all these other people are going to jail for less stuff.
[02:50:40.390 --> 02:50:44.750]  How the hell do we not say he's protected whether you're right or wrong?
[02:50:44.750 --> 02:50:45.750]  That's your opinion.
[02:50:45.750 --> 02:50:49.350]  Of course, we know that's not just your opinion.
[02:50:49.350 --> 02:50:50.350]  What do you make now?
[02:50:50.350 --> 02:50:54.310]  When we say Fed, Fed, Fed, maybe you want to work for the FBI, maybe work for the D.C.
[02:50:54.310 --> 02:50:58.310]  police or a private corporate cut out group, because now we know more and more from congressmen
[02:50:58.310 --> 02:51:04.710]  and others that the foot video shows undercover off duty D.C. police.
[02:51:04.710 --> 02:51:07.950]  I don't think the Capitol Police were in on it other than a stand down and their commanders
[02:51:07.950 --> 02:51:10.910]  not giving them orders to use the PA system.
[02:51:10.910 --> 02:51:12.990]  They should have taken matters in their own hands, in my view.
[02:51:12.990 --> 02:51:16.670]  But the D.C. police were involved with other federal agents as well.
[02:51:16.670 --> 02:51:20.910]  I mean, I think there there's obviously something big here from your deep research.
[02:51:20.910 --> 02:51:26.110]  If you learn more about the coalition of government operatives that, you know, help provocateur
[02:51:26.110 --> 02:51:27.110]  this.
[02:51:27.110 --> 02:51:34.790]  Yes, but I like to maintain focus and I've maintained that there are two smoking guns
[02:51:34.790 --> 02:51:35.790]  in the feds.
[02:51:35.790 --> 02:51:39.110]  One is that the other is the pipe bomb.
[02:51:39.110 --> 02:51:46.190]  And those two dimensions of January 6th have occupied most of my time and focus, because
[02:51:46.190 --> 02:51:49.390]  I think those are the highest leverage.
[02:51:49.390 --> 02:51:52.070]  As for EPS being protected, you're absolutely right.
[02:51:52.070 --> 02:51:56.350]  And I want to make it clear, I've never maintained that EPS is a federal agent.
[02:51:56.350 --> 02:51:58.510]  I don't actually think he's a federal agent.
[02:51:58.510 --> 02:52:00.870]  I don't think he's an FBI agent.
[02:52:00.870 --> 02:52:06.190]  He was leaning very heavily on this denial of being involved with law enforcement.
[02:52:06.190 --> 02:52:10.190]  And I would repeatedly point out that the Department of Homeland Security is not a
[02:52:10.190 --> 02:52:11.830]  law enforcement agency.
[02:52:11.830 --> 02:52:14.230]  Military intelligence isn't a law enforcement agency.
[02:52:14.230 --> 02:52:17.470]  There are many federal agencies that are not law enforcement.
[02:52:17.470 --> 02:52:18.470]  Sure.
[02:52:18.470 --> 02:52:22.030]  And as you know, different agencies recruit different agencies recruit for a certain
[02:52:22.030 --> 02:52:24.510]  look historically, not just in U.S. history.
[02:52:24.510 --> 02:52:31.270]  He has he has a military door kicker look and an intel look that would then be hired
[02:52:31.270 --> 02:52:32.270]  by an NGO.
[02:52:32.270 --> 02:52:36.150]  If I had to say something and I'm not saying this, I'm saying he looks like
[02:52:36.150 --> 02:52:39.270]  military intel hired by an NGO.
[02:52:39.270 --> 02:52:44.550]  Yes, it could be that it could be a private cut out group.
[02:52:44.550 --> 02:52:49.670]  I will only say and I'll maintain that any reasonable person looking at the context,
[02:52:49.670 --> 02:52:55.190]  looking at behavior, considering that the DOJ hasn't charged him despite him being really
[02:52:55.190 --> 02:52:59.550]  kind of a poster boy to someone who could have been, you know, the poster boy for this
[02:52:59.550 --> 02:53:04.030]  so-called, you know, insurrection, given all of his background and behavior.
[02:53:04.030 --> 02:53:07.870]  The fact that they're defending and not charging him when they could, they could charge him
[02:53:07.870 --> 02:53:10.790]  with trespassing like they did Owen Schroer.
[02:53:10.790 --> 02:53:17.310]  They could charge him with conspiracy and they charge others with conspiracy for doing
[02:53:17.310 --> 02:53:18.950]  very similar things.
[02:53:18.950 --> 02:53:21.910]  So it wasn't like they couldn't have charged him if they wanted to.
[02:53:21.910 --> 02:53:22.910]  They decided not to.
[02:53:22.910 --> 02:53:24.030]  And the question is, why?
[02:53:24.030 --> 02:53:25.790]  Why was he being protected?
[02:53:25.790 --> 02:53:34.010]  And I think the overwhelmingly likely answer to that is that he was not an organic participant
[02:53:34.010 --> 02:53:35.890]  in January 6th.
[02:53:35.890 --> 02:53:36.890]  He was-
[02:53:36.890 --> 02:53:37.890]  I totally agree.
[02:53:37.890 --> 02:53:39.130]  So let me throw this out.
[02:53:39.130 --> 02:53:45.210]  Will Ray Epps and his Democratic Party lawyers, will they sue the people the night before
[02:53:45.210 --> 02:53:47.130]  that screamed fed at him?
[02:53:47.130 --> 02:53:52.450]  Because are we not allowed if someone's calling for invading the Capitol, whether we were right
[02:53:52.450 --> 02:53:53.450]  or wrong?
[02:53:53.450 --> 02:53:54.450]  Can I scream at somebody?
[02:53:54.450 --> 02:53:55.450]  You're a purple man.
[02:53:55.450 --> 02:53:56.450]  You're a green man.
[02:53:56.450 --> 02:53:57.450]  You're a pink man.
[02:53:57.450 --> 02:53:59.210]  Or I can say, I think you're an Easter bunny.
[02:53:59.210 --> 02:54:00.890]  It just, I see you walking on the street.
[02:54:00.890 --> 02:54:05.690]  I think you're a gorilla, or I think you're an elf, or I think you're a storm cloud.
[02:54:05.690 --> 02:54:08.250]  I mean, people thought he was a fed.
[02:54:08.250 --> 02:54:10.530]  Why aren't they allowed to have that view too?
[02:54:10.530 --> 02:54:15.750]  Why aren't you as a professor and a political scientist saying, everybody else got charged.
[02:54:15.750 --> 02:54:16.750]  This guy didn't.
[02:54:16.750 --> 02:54:18.610]  Whatever happened to our First Amendment?
[02:54:18.610 --> 02:54:22.930]  Well, you know, they're picking their targets strategically and it's clear they have in
[02:54:22.930 --> 02:54:28.650]  their crosshairs, you know, Fox News for the money, but they want to destroy Tucker Carlson
[02:54:28.650 --> 02:54:31.530]  and me and revolver.news for reporting it.
[02:54:31.530 --> 02:54:38.610]  In the legal complaint, they identify me as originator and chief purveyor of the coverage
[02:54:38.610 --> 02:54:42.110]  on EPS, which they find objectionable and defamatory.
[02:54:42.110 --> 02:54:45.370]  And I'm proud to say that I am the originator of this reporting.
[02:54:45.370 --> 02:54:47.930]  It's not defamatory in any capacity.
[02:54:47.930 --> 02:54:50.210]  We're very careful and nuanced.
[02:54:50.210 --> 02:54:55.450]  And I think the questions that we raise and the suggested answers, the possible answers
[02:54:55.450 --> 02:54:59.730]  to those questions are well within reasonable discourse.
[02:54:59.730 --> 02:55:02.170]  They're entirely unobjectionable.
[02:55:02.170 --> 02:55:07.410]  If they turn to a lawsuit against revolver news, they will lose.
[02:55:07.410 --> 02:55:09.050]  They have a very weak case.
[02:55:09.050 --> 02:55:12.930]  So if they if they decide to do that, I'm prepared for it.
[02:55:12.930 --> 02:55:17.490]  For now, they're going after Fox, which is the soft target.
[02:55:17.490 --> 02:55:20.890]  But let's see if they bring it to me and revolver.
[02:55:20.890 --> 02:55:21.890]  We're prepared.
[02:55:21.890 --> 02:55:22.890]  We're ready.
[02:55:22.890 --> 02:55:25.730]  Ray EPS is so suspicious.
[02:55:25.730 --> 02:55:26.730]  It's so dirty.
[02:55:26.730 --> 02:55:27.730]  The whole thing.
[02:55:27.730 --> 02:55:29.550]  Well, I mean, it's but hold on, professor.
[02:55:29.550 --> 02:55:33.250]  It's not like he testified to Congress that he orchestrated it.
[02:55:33.250 --> 02:55:38.250]  Now, if you had a text message where he confessed to orchestrating and if he admitted to Congress,
[02:55:38.250 --> 02:55:39.570]  then you'd have no problem.
[02:55:39.570 --> 02:55:41.090]  But you don't have him confess.
[02:55:41.090 --> 02:55:42.090]  Wait, wait.
[02:55:42.090 --> 02:55:43.090]  But you do.
[02:55:43.090 --> 02:55:44.090]  He did say that.
[02:55:44.090 --> 02:55:45.090]  Right.
[02:55:45.090 --> 02:55:47.930]  I mean, he's so you know, he should sue himself for defamation.
[02:55:47.930 --> 02:55:52.650]  He should sue the New York Times for defamation, because as I pointed out, the New York Times
[02:55:53.410 --> 02:55:59.330]  featured EPS in its Day of Rage documentary, contextually suggesting that he should sue
[02:55:59.330 --> 02:56:00.330]  the FBI.
[02:56:00.330 --> 02:56:03.330]  The FBI put him on the most wanted list.
[02:56:03.330 --> 02:56:04.330]  Exactly.
[02:56:04.330 --> 02:56:06.090]  So it's ridiculous.
[02:56:06.090 --> 02:56:07.890]  It's clearly a targeted approach.
[02:56:07.890 --> 02:56:10.690]  They want to go after the people who are effective in media.
[02:56:10.690 --> 02:56:16.610]  Tucker Carlson is effective in media and Revolver News pound for pound might be the most effective
[02:56:16.610 --> 02:56:20.970]  organization in media in terms of an upstart and changing now.
[02:56:20.970 --> 02:56:21.970]  I agree.
[02:56:22.290 --> 02:56:23.290]  You've done a great job.
[02:56:23.290 --> 02:56:24.290]  That's why they're after us.
[02:56:24.290 --> 02:56:25.290]  All right.
[02:56:25.290 --> 02:56:26.290]  Join us again with a better connection.
[02:56:26.290 --> 02:56:28.330]  It was still great information.
[02:56:28.330 --> 02:56:30.970]  Thank you, Dr. Revolver Dot News.
[02:56:30.970 --> 02:56:32.770]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:56:32.770 --> 02:56:34.530]  Amazing info.
[02:56:34.530 --> 02:56:35.530]  Thank you.
[02:56:35.530 --> 02:56:36.530]  Yeah.
[02:56:36.530 --> 02:56:37.530]  This gives me a headache, folks.
[02:56:37.530 --> 02:56:39.410]  I mean, he's ramming signs into people.
[02:56:39.410 --> 02:56:40.770]  He's saying, go in.
[02:56:40.770 --> 02:56:43.610]  My reporters are being arrested trying to stop people going in.
[02:56:43.610 --> 02:56:46.970]  I mean, I'm just like, come on, man, to use a Joe Biden quote.
[02:56:46.970 --> 02:56:50.490]  I am well done with this crap.
[02:56:50.490 --> 02:56:53.570]  I am well done with it.
[02:56:53.570 --> 02:56:59.410]  I mean, if the feds had me saying I orchestrated an attack and I'm up there saying, invade
[02:56:59.410 --> 02:57:02.050]  the Capitol, I'd be in jail right now.
[02:57:02.050 --> 02:57:03.050]  Not this guy.
[02:57:03.050 --> 02:57:05.050]  And then now he's going to sue everybody.
[02:57:05.050 --> 02:57:06.050]  Woo.
[02:57:06.050 --> 02:57:08.050]  Talk about horse manure.
[02:57:08.050 --> 02:57:09.930]  This is the definition of it.
[02:57:09.930 --> 02:57:13.330]  Hey, I'm the billion five hundred million dollar man.
[02:57:13.330 --> 02:57:14.690]  Everybody else sue me all day.
[02:57:14.690 --> 02:57:15.690]  I don't have anything.
[02:57:15.690 --> 02:57:18.850]  Do Hernandez is about to take over.
[02:57:18.850 --> 02:57:22.810]  I did not plug this hour and barely last hour, and I'm our biggest problem.
[02:57:22.810 --> 02:57:25.250]  We have the Patriot pride.
[02:57:25.250 --> 02:57:32.530]  I told the crew to make a red, white and blue rainbow, and they said, don't think you're
[02:57:32.530 --> 02:57:33.530]  being liberal.
[02:57:33.530 --> 02:57:34.530]  And I said, no, no, no.
[02:57:34.530 --> 02:57:35.530]  It's a joke.
[02:57:35.530 --> 02:57:40.490]  And the crew rebelled and did not make a red, white and blue rainbow.
[02:57:40.490 --> 02:57:44.010]  But it's about Patriot pride, not pedo pride.
[02:57:44.010 --> 02:57:51.890]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic five
[02:57:51.890 --> 02:57:53.930]  G or the GMO crops.
[02:57:53.930 --> 02:57:58.770]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and
[02:57:58.770 --> 02:57:59.770]  industry to use.
[02:57:59.770 --> 02:58:03.650]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[02:58:03.650 --> 02:58:07.310]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply
[02:58:07.310 --> 02:58:12.890]  is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[02:58:12.890 --> 02:58:13.890]  Look it up.
[02:58:13.890 --> 02:58:15.290]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[02:58:15.290 --> 02:58:20.530]  We have the very best gravity fed filter system out there, highest rated at half the price
[02:58:20.530 --> 02:58:21.650]  of leading competitors.
[02:58:21.650 --> 02:58:23.970]  The Alexa Pure ready to ship to you right now.
[02:58:23.970 --> 02:58:26.250]  We have replacement filters for folks who've already gotten it.
[02:58:26.250 --> 02:58:28.170]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[02:58:28.170 --> 02:58:29.210]  It is amazing.
[02:58:29.210 --> 02:58:30.810]  It's great for your home, your business.
[02:58:30.810 --> 02:58:34.010]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, whatever, well water.
[02:58:34.010 --> 02:58:35.490]  Almost everything's contaminated.
[02:58:35.490 --> 02:58:39.530]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.
[02:58:39.530 --> 02:58:41.250]  Get yours today at Infoworkstore.com.
[02:58:41.250 --> 02:58:43.550]  For a limited time, we're running a 10% discount.
[02:58:43.550 --> 02:58:44.550]  That is a huge discount.
[02:58:44.550 --> 02:58:45.910]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[02:58:45.910 --> 02:58:47.830]  You need this filter.
[02:58:47.830 --> 02:58:50.110]  Infowars is a one of a kind operation.
[02:58:50.110 --> 02:58:54.590]  And so please go to Infowars store and just make a donation and you can make it one time
[02:58:54.590 --> 02:58:55.590]  or recurring.

[02:59:11.830 --> 02:59:16.510]  That way we get 95% of it after credit card fees that are making 20, 30, 40% like we do
[02:59:16.510 --> 02:59:17.510]  on the products.
[02:59:17.510 --> 02:59:18.510]  But these really are amazing products.
[02:59:18.510 --> 02:59:20.750]  The big July 4th sale's going on right now.
[02:59:20.750 --> 02:59:23.330]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the new world order.
[02:59:23.330 --> 02:59:26.790]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated, people are listening more than ever.
[02:59:26.790 --> 02:59:31.030]  But in this major recession, going into depression and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's
[02:59:31.030 --> 02:59:32.030]  hard.
[02:59:32.030 --> 02:59:33.030]  I know times are tough.
[02:59:33.030 --> 02:59:36.510]  So thank you for your support, but whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the
[02:59:36.510 --> 02:59:38.070]  articles and the videos.
[02:59:38.070 --> 02:59:39.070]  That you can do for free.
[02:59:39.070 --> 02:59:41.510]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[02:59:41.510 --> 02:59:45.030]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now and I thank
[02:59:45.030 --> 02:59:46.030]  you from the bottom of my heart.
[02:59:46.030 --> 02:59:47.030]  God bless you.
[02:59:47.030 --> 02:59:55.030]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:59:57.600 --> 03:00:07.040]  Well, a lot of people say we live in boring times.
[03:00:07.040 --> 03:00:09.400]  I say those people are brain dead.
[03:00:09.400 --> 03:00:16.280]  Well, the amazing, dynamic Drew Hernandez is set to take over in about five minutes from
[03:00:16.280 --> 03:00:17.280]  now.
[03:00:17.280 --> 03:00:18.280]  There he is on screen.
[03:00:18.280 --> 03:00:20.040]  Let's punch him up.
[03:00:20.040 --> 03:00:22.240]  I like that shirt.
[03:00:22.240 --> 03:00:23.240]  We really appreciate it.
[03:00:23.240 --> 03:00:25.720]  Hernandez, he's an amazing guy.
[03:00:25.720 --> 03:00:30.520]  And I'm going to do a special two-hour Saturday show with Dr. Raymond Labo, live, noon to
[03:00:30.520 --> 03:00:31.520]  2 p.m.
[03:00:31.520 --> 03:00:35.160]  We've got other big guests and things tomorrow that are going to be very informative.
[03:00:35.160 --> 03:00:42.440]  We will have next week the director, the star, and the actual hero of Sound of Freedom.
[03:00:42.440 --> 03:00:43.440]  That is coming up.
[03:00:43.440 --> 03:00:46.040]  We've got so much more for you tomorrow as well.
[03:00:46.040 --> 03:00:50.880]  But let me now cut a live ad on air, because I haven't had time to cut an ad for the new
[03:00:50.880 --> 03:00:51.880]  special.
[03:00:51.880 --> 03:00:52.880]  If you don't fund the operation, we're going to shut down.
[03:00:52.880 --> 03:00:56.480]  So bear with me.
[03:00:56.480 --> 03:01:00.680]  We sell products that will empower you and your family's life.
[03:01:00.680 --> 03:01:03.640]  We sell products that are real game changers.
[03:01:03.640 --> 03:01:09.280]  Corporate media says we sell snake oil, high-quality, gravity-fed water filter, stainless steel that
[03:01:09.280 --> 03:01:16.600]  if you look at the competitors are at the highest ratings there are for around 50% of
[03:01:16.600 --> 03:01:18.640]  the price of leading competitors.
[03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:24.840]  Despite that, right now we have the Patriot pride sale going for the rest of July to counter
[03:01:24.840 --> 03:01:28.000]  the Bud Light communist pedo pride.
[03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:35.520]  So we have 10% off on water filtration, air filtration, storable foods right now at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:01:35.520 --> 03:01:41.760]  We have double Patriot points, meaning you get 10% off on your next order, not 5% off.
[03:01:41.760 --> 03:01:47.440]  We have Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra, the current amazing brain-boosting nootropics
[03:01:47.440 --> 03:01:52.840]  that were 50% off together, they're now 50% off individually.
[03:01:52.840 --> 03:01:55.000]  We have probiotic fiber, 50% off.

[03:02:12.500 --> 03:02:14.160]  So it's 60.
[03:02:14.160 --> 03:02:16.600]  Experience libido, the stamina of the energy.
[03:02:16.600 --> 03:02:19.320]  Metal Shield X3, about to sell out, 25% off.

[03:02:56.960 --> 03:02:57.960]  World.
[03:02:57.960 --> 03:02:58.960]  Get a signed copy.
[03:02:58.960 --> 03:02:59.960]  Only a few hundred left.
[03:02:59.960 --> 03:03:00.960]  That's a fundraiser.
[03:03:00.960 --> 03:03:02.120]  Get an Alex Jones for President t-shirt.
[03:03:02.120 --> 03:03:03.120]  No more are being printed.
[03:03:03.120 --> 03:03:05.600]  They're like, hey, boss, you said this is limited edition.
[03:03:05.600 --> 03:03:06.600]  We did a third printing.
[03:03:06.600 --> 03:03:07.640]  They're about to sell out.
[03:03:07.640 --> 03:03:08.640]  What's the new shirt?
[03:03:08.640 --> 03:03:10.840]  I've been so busy, I haven't come up with a new shirt.
[03:03:10.840 --> 03:03:11.840]  But we'll have a new one.
[03:03:11.840 --> 03:03:14.000]  But no more of that shirt's getting printed.
[03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:16.480]  Or the Trump Political Prisoner shirt.
[03:03:16.480 --> 03:03:20.800]  There's like a thousand of those left, less than a thousand Alex Jones shirts left.
[03:03:20.800 --> 03:03:22.240]  I want to thank you for your support.
[03:03:22.240 --> 03:03:24.080]  I don't have George Soros backing me.
[03:03:24.080 --> 03:03:26.520]  I don't have the globalists backing me.
[03:03:26.520 --> 03:03:29.480]  I have we the people backing us.
[03:03:29.480 --> 03:03:31.040]  Please go to infowarsstore.com.

[03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:44.440]  And whatever you do, share the articles and the videos.
[03:03:44.440 --> 03:03:46.920]  And I see you doing it.
[03:03:46.920 --> 03:03:48.960]  Some of you re-upload, it gets 100 views.
[03:03:48.960 --> 03:03:50.480]  That's amazing.
[03:03:50.480 --> 03:03:56.280]  Globalist politicians, people that are beneath Trump, top level Republican candidates are
[03:03:56.280 --> 03:03:59.320]  talking to crowds of 20 people.
[03:03:59.320 --> 03:04:03.320]  I see our listeners, I can't even keep track of it, thousands of videos with a couple
[03:04:03.320 --> 03:04:04.320]  hundred views.
[03:04:04.320 --> 03:04:05.320]  I just see them.
[03:04:05.320 --> 03:04:06.320]  Boom, boom, boom.
[03:04:06.320 --> 03:04:07.320]  I check the aggregator.
[03:04:07.320 --> 03:04:09.240]  I see hundreds of videos with thousands of views.
[03:04:09.240 --> 03:04:12.220]  I see dozens of videos with hundreds of thousands of views.
[03:04:12.220 --> 03:04:15.600]  And I see several videos with millions of views without even looking.
[03:04:15.600 --> 03:04:18.360]  It's just every day.
[03:04:18.360 --> 03:04:23.000]  So if you put out a video and 100 people watch it, that's a devastating victory.
[03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:27.280]  But some of you put it out and 1,000 see it, somebody else sees it, grabs it, and a million
[03:04:27.280 --> 03:04:28.280]  watch it.
[03:04:28.280 --> 03:04:29.640]  That's how we win wars.
[03:04:29.640 --> 03:04:33.960]  That's human intelligence overriding AI via the Holy Spirit.
[03:04:33.960 --> 03:04:38.160]  So spread the word, pray for the broadcast, and get products that enrich your life while
[03:04:38.160 --> 03:04:39.560]  funding our operation.
[03:04:39.560 --> 03:04:47.720]  Go to infowarestore.com now for the Patriot Pride Month that fights pedophilia, that fights
[03:04:47.720 --> 03:04:51.480]  abortion, that fights Satanism, and gives you great products.
[03:04:51.480 --> 03:04:54.920]  Patriot Pride Month, infowarestore.com, up to 60% off.
[03:04:54.920 --> 03:04:58.640]  Drew Hernandez takes over now.
[03:04:58.640 --> 03:05:04.040]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food
[03:05:04.040 --> 03:05:05.400]  supply.
[03:05:05.400 --> 03:05:10.040]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[03:05:10.040 --> 03:05:14.240]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[03:05:14.240 --> 03:05:17.060]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[03:05:17.060 --> 03:05:20.400]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:05:20.400 --> 03:05:25.600]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[03:05:25.600 --> 03:05:28.880]  keep the soil rich with iodine.
[03:05:28.880 --> 03:05:35.000]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day, derived from ancient
[03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:39.280]  sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[03:05:39.280 --> 03:05:45.120]  Our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[03:05:45.120 --> 03:05:51.240]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[03:05:51.240 --> 03:05:57.480]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at infowarestore.com.
[03:06:05.160 --> 03:06:12.000]  All righty, InfoWarriors, welcome to the fourth hour of the most banned transmission show
[03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:13.720]  in the universe, in the galaxy.
[03:06:13.720 --> 03:06:14.960]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:14.960 --> 03:06:17.840]  I am your host, guest host, Drew Hernandez.
[03:06:17.840 --> 03:06:20.320]  I want to thank every single one of you guys for being here.
[03:06:20.320 --> 03:06:23.880]  Like Alex just said, and he's serious about this, guys.
[03:06:23.880 --> 03:06:24.880]  Very serious.
[03:06:24.880 --> 03:06:29.160]  He loves to see this stuff, whether it's on Twitter, Getter, Truth Social, no matter where
[03:06:29.160 --> 03:06:31.920]  you're cutting up clips, you're making your own memes.
[03:06:31.920 --> 03:06:34.720]  These things go like super viral, especially on Twitter.
[03:06:34.720 --> 03:06:39.320]  Personally, we love to see this stuff on Twitter, because obviously Elon will not establish
[03:06:39.320 --> 03:06:43.760]  InfoWars or Alex Jones or Owen Schreier officially back on Twitter.
[03:06:43.760 --> 03:06:48.480]  So when you guys are doing stuff like that, and he's not lying, he sees this stuff.
[03:06:48.480 --> 03:06:54.240]  Sometimes I'll see like a really based, sick edit or clip of the show, something he said,
[03:06:54.240 --> 03:06:55.680]  I'll just send it to him.
[03:06:55.680 --> 03:06:57.280]  And he loves this kind of stuff, guys.
[03:06:57.280 --> 03:06:58.960]  So keep that going, man.
[03:06:58.960 --> 03:06:59.960]  Keep that going.
[03:06:59.960 --> 03:07:05.080]  InfoWars.com, ban.video, the InfoWars Army, spreading that information no matter where
[03:07:05.080 --> 03:07:06.840]  we go, no matter where we are.
[03:07:06.840 --> 03:07:08.480]  That's how this works, guys.
[03:07:08.480 --> 03:07:11.440]  OK, doesn't matter if they ban one of us.
[03:07:11.440 --> 03:07:16.640]  Doesn't matter if they ban a million of us, because the freedom movement will always survive.
[03:07:16.640 --> 03:07:18.000]  We will always be here.
[03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:19.000]  All right.
[03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:23.320]  The freedom fighters have always opposed tyranny since the beginning of time.
[03:07:23.320 --> 03:07:24.320]  All right.
[03:07:24.320 --> 03:07:29.080]  And this is why the New World Order and the satanic global cabal, they just cannot figure
[03:07:29.200 --> 03:07:33.760]  out or understand how to put a stop to every single one of us.
[03:07:33.760 --> 03:07:36.040]  Because there could be a revolutionary figure.
[03:07:36.040 --> 03:07:40.320]  There could be one individual that decides to come out and literally stand up against
[03:07:40.320 --> 03:07:42.680]  on their own two feet against tyranny.
[03:07:42.680 --> 03:07:47.800]  And once that happens, it mobilizes, it activates a million other people.
[03:07:47.800 --> 03:07:51.000]  So all it takes is one.
[03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:54.120]  It truly only takes one individual.
[03:07:54.120 --> 03:07:58.600]  And that amplifies, it lights a fire amongst everybody else, because everybody else gets
[03:07:58.600 --> 03:08:00.080]  plugged out of the matrix.
[03:08:00.080 --> 03:08:02.880]  And this is this is how the globalists think.
[03:08:02.880 --> 03:08:04.400]  They know this stuff.
[03:08:04.400 --> 03:08:09.520]  They know when one individual gets jacked outside of the matrix, John Connor escapes
[03:08:09.520 --> 03:08:16.360]  the Terminator and starts to like really just get together the entire like futuristic revolutionary,
[03:08:16.360 --> 03:08:20.880]  you know, army together fighting against the A.I., fighting against the global regime,
[03:08:20.880 --> 03:08:25.720]  fighting against the Terminators, fighting against the W.E.F., fighting against the U.N.,
[03:08:25.720 --> 03:08:27.560]  fighting against the E.U.
[03:08:27.560 --> 03:08:31.440]  And I'm not calling for violence, but what I'm saying is these people clearly think
[03:08:31.440 --> 03:08:34.480]  this way and they understand this stuff.
[03:08:34.480 --> 03:08:38.240]  So don't let these people convince you that you are the minority.
[03:08:38.240 --> 03:08:40.680]  Don't let them convince you that you're the crazy person.
[03:08:40.680 --> 03:08:42.400]  You're the conspiracy theorist.
[03:08:42.400 --> 03:08:44.440]  You're just believing in a bunch of nonsense.
[03:08:44.440 --> 03:08:46.560]  You're just the town crazy person.
[03:08:46.560 --> 03:08:50.800]  You're the guy that's just running around claiming that the world's going to end and you look
[03:08:50.800 --> 03:08:56.520]  all psychotic, you know, not showering and your beard is all out of control and you look
[03:08:56.520 --> 03:08:58.360]  disgusting like you're a leftist.
[03:08:58.360 --> 03:08:59.880]  Actually, it's them.
[03:08:59.880 --> 03:09:02.120]  That's actually the climate cult.
[03:09:02.120 --> 03:09:06.120]  That's their people running around doing that with terrible hygiene.
[03:09:06.120 --> 03:09:08.640]  You know, you always see these people with terrible hygiene.
[03:09:08.640 --> 03:09:09.640]  They're not allowed.
[03:09:09.640 --> 03:09:11.920]  The climate cult's not allowed to have deodorant.
[03:09:11.920 --> 03:09:16.540]  They're not allowed to brush their teeth because that hires their carbon footprint.
[03:09:16.540 --> 03:09:18.320]  They're not allowed to do their hair.
[03:09:18.320 --> 03:09:20.200]  The women can't wear makeup.
[03:09:20.200 --> 03:09:21.200]  They're all disgusting.
[03:09:21.200 --> 03:09:22.480]  Like, they look gross.
[03:09:22.480 --> 03:09:26.500]  They smell, you know, their body, the disgusting lesbians.
[03:09:26.500 --> 03:09:30.740]  Their breasts are all flopping all over the place and jiggling and they're just like these
[03:09:30.740 --> 03:09:33.500]  walruses and you guys know what I'm talking about.
[03:09:33.500 --> 03:09:35.260]  That's what they want.
[03:09:35.260 --> 03:09:36.580]  They want that.
[03:09:36.580 --> 03:09:39.580]  That's why they slander the truth speakers.
[03:09:39.580 --> 03:09:44.180]  That's why they slander the ones that are truly the John Connors, all right, that are
[03:09:44.180 --> 03:09:51.420]  not only escaping, you know, the AI technocracy, futuristic war that wants to impose its will
[03:09:51.420 --> 03:09:53.020]  upon all of us.
[03:09:53.020 --> 03:09:54.020]  And if we don't, we die.
[03:09:54.020 --> 03:09:55.020]  No, no, no.
[03:09:55.020 --> 03:09:56.020]  They're not.
[03:09:56.020 --> 03:10:00.820]  They don't only see that these people are evading them, but we're exposing guys.
[03:10:00.820 --> 03:10:03.740]  We evade, we expose, we win.
[03:10:03.740 --> 03:10:06.380]  We evade, we expose, we win.
[03:10:06.380 --> 03:10:08.300]  That's how this stuff works.
[03:10:08.300 --> 03:10:13.940]  And you know, they know this, you know, recently I've been, I'll post things on Instagram every
[03:10:13.940 --> 03:10:17.540]  now and then and post like a W E F clip.
[03:10:17.540 --> 03:10:20.060]  I'll post like a world economic forum supporter.
[03:10:20.060 --> 03:10:24.820]  I like to call them agents posted one the other day and it went super viral on Twitter
[03:10:24.820 --> 03:10:28.820]  when super viral on Instagram and immediately the fact checkers bounce on it, they jump
[03:10:28.820 --> 03:10:29.820]  on it.
[03:10:29.820 --> 03:10:33.780]  AP and all these other fact checkers that are designated, that are authorized by the
[03:10:33.780 --> 03:10:38.700]  new world order and made it to make sure that you are not believing this information.
[03:10:38.700 --> 03:10:46.820]  They slap a fat check on it and it's literally a world economic forum supporter telling people
[03:10:46.820 --> 03:10:49.800]  that the coming they're talking about cashless.
[03:10:49.800 --> 03:10:52.020]  They're talking about a digitized system of economy.
[03:10:52.020 --> 03:10:57.180]  You guys all saw the clip saying that, well, this is going to lead to economies having
[03:10:57.180 --> 03:10:59.860]  the ability to lock anyone out.
[03:10:59.860 --> 03:11:00.860]  That's undesirable.
[03:11:00.860 --> 03:11:02.860]  I'm paraphrasing.
[03:11:02.860 --> 03:11:07.660]  And of course the clip got hundreds of thousands of views.
[03:11:07.660 --> 03:11:10.720]  You look at the comments, people are like, screw the W E F.
[03:11:10.720 --> 03:11:12.660]  We're not going to submit to this tyranny.
[03:11:12.660 --> 03:11:14.140]  We're done with these people.
[03:11:14.140 --> 03:11:15.540]  This is America.
[03:11:15.540 --> 03:11:19.940]  And then the fact checkers come in and they slap a label on it.
[03:11:20.460 --> 03:11:22.500]  You guys can go see this on my Instagram right now.
[03:11:22.500 --> 03:11:23.500]  Andrew Hernandez live.
[03:11:23.500 --> 03:11:28.980]  It's like the third or the fourth post and they try to block it out from people seeing
[03:11:28.980 --> 03:11:29.980]  it.
[03:11:29.980 --> 03:11:35.460]  Now, I'm not, this is, this is like, this is like, you know, not even the pre-course,
[03:11:35.460 --> 03:11:38.180]  you know, breakfast for anyone that watches info wars.
[03:11:38.180 --> 03:11:42.980]  I guess what I'm trying to say is, you know, you see these people desperately trying to
[03:11:42.980 --> 03:11:48.860]  discredit even what their own people say, because in the fact check, they're like, well, this
[03:11:48.860 --> 03:11:51.780]  is just a misrepresentation of what he actually said.
[03:11:51.780 --> 03:11:56.340]  He was just saying that, you know, this could potentially happen in the, uh, you know, in
[03:11:56.340 --> 03:12:00.940]  a, in a, in a governmental society or a dictatorial society that they could, they, they might
[03:12:00.940 --> 03:12:02.740]  impose their will on people.
[03:12:02.740 --> 03:12:03.740]  Yeah.
[03:12:03.740 --> 03:12:08.700]  That's kind of what we are all saying, but they try to run their fact checkers and their
[03:12:08.700 --> 03:12:13.460]  propaganda with these mental gymnastics to be like, well, that guy's saying it in negative
[03:12:13.460 --> 03:12:16.380]  light, but this guy's saying it because he's a good guy.
[03:12:16.380 --> 03:12:18.300]  He's just a warning, right?
[03:12:18.740 --> 03:12:19.900]  No, they're allowed to come out.
[03:12:19.900 --> 03:12:23.900]  They try to mental gymnastic everything, but that's the cult.
[03:12:23.900 --> 03:12:25.180]  That's the cult.
[03:12:25.180 --> 03:12:28.940]  The point is, is these people know that we know what they're doing.
[03:12:28.940 --> 03:12:31.100]  These people know that we're fully awake.
[03:12:31.100 --> 03:12:32.100]  Okay.
[03:12:32.100 --> 03:12:33.100]  Not all gay and woke.
[03:12:33.100 --> 03:12:34.100]  All right.
[03:12:34.100 --> 03:12:37.100]  We're fully awake, fully jacked out of the matrix.
[03:12:37.100 --> 03:12:39.380]  John Connors activated.
[03:12:39.380 --> 03:12:40.980]  We are fighting the new world order.
[03:12:40.980 --> 03:12:42.820]  We are fighting the AI takeovers.
[03:12:42.820 --> 03:12:48.580]  We are fighting the futuristic regime, technocracies, the 1984 literal tyranny that they want to
[03:12:48.580 --> 03:12:49.660]  impose on all of us.
[03:12:49.660 --> 03:12:52.780]  They all talk about this out in the open.
[03:12:52.780 --> 03:12:57.140]  They say this stuff, but they try to make you sound like you're crazy.
[03:12:57.140 --> 03:12:58.140]  There it is right there.
[03:12:58.140 --> 03:12:59.140]  Third post.
[03:12:59.140 --> 03:13:00.140]  There it is.
[03:13:00.140 --> 03:13:01.500]  Super viral video.
[03:13:01.500 --> 03:13:02.500]  Everybody saw this.
[03:13:02.500 --> 03:13:03.500]  There it is.
[03:13:03.500 --> 03:13:04.500]  There it is.
[03:13:04.500 --> 03:13:07.780]  And look, I trolled them and I put, okay, supporter.
[03:13:07.780 --> 03:13:08.780]  You didn't like that.
[03:13:08.780 --> 03:13:09.780]  I said, agent.
[03:13:09.780 --> 03:13:10.780]  Okay.
[03:13:10.780 --> 03:13:11.780]  Supporter.
[03:13:11.820 --> 03:13:14.060]  You got to troll these people, but they are desperate.
[03:13:14.060 --> 03:13:15.060]  It's AP.
[03:13:15.060 --> 03:13:16.980]  I don't know if you guys can find it.
[03:13:16.980 --> 03:13:18.420]  You might, there might be a link right there.
[03:13:18.420 --> 03:13:22.820]  If you click the actual fact check, it'll open up the AP article.
[03:13:22.820 --> 03:13:26.780]  And it's just like, it's just some like woke white leftist women trying to shut me down.
[03:13:26.780 --> 03:13:31.860]  And it's, it's just hilarious, you know, but they know that their battle plans have been
[03:13:31.860 --> 03:13:33.120]  exposed.
[03:13:33.120 --> 03:13:36.660]  And when this happens, they have to shut it down.
[03:13:36.660 --> 03:13:38.340]  They have to discredit it.
[03:13:38.340 --> 03:13:44.020]  Even though when they themselves are saying this stuff, oh, they're warning about a authoritarian
[03:13:44.020 --> 03:13:47.780]  regime taking advantage of a cashless digitized society.
[03:13:47.780 --> 03:13:49.780]  Oh, he, there it is right there.
[03:13:49.780 --> 03:13:50.780]  AP.
[03:13:50.780 --> 03:13:54.420]  And the one on the bottom, all the fact checkers.
[03:13:54.420 --> 03:13:55.700]  Would you look at that?
[03:13:55.700 --> 03:14:00.660]  Shutting down the own words, shutting down their own words.
[03:14:00.660 --> 03:14:04.980]  The world economic forums words, these people, oh, he's not bought and paid for, oh, he's
[03:14:04.980 --> 03:14:06.860]  not a world economic forum agent.
[03:14:06.860 --> 03:14:11.620]  Well, he's definitely a world economic forum supporter.
[03:14:11.620 --> 03:14:18.380]  And you don't get on that stage unless you are designated a true, uh, okay, let's use
[03:14:18.380 --> 03:14:19.420]  your terms.
[03:14:19.420 --> 03:14:23.140]  They like to call themselves stakeholders, right?
[03:14:23.140 --> 03:14:24.140]  Shareholders of the new world order.
[03:14:24.140 --> 03:14:25.740]  You guys have all heard this nonsense.
[03:14:25.740 --> 03:14:28.140]  Just watch five minutes of any of their conferences.
[03:14:28.140 --> 03:14:33.140]  Well, you, we have the future of the stakeholders and the stakeholders in their regime.
[03:14:33.140 --> 03:14:34.140]  You are a stakeholder.
[03:14:34.140 --> 03:14:35.940]  You are the Hitler youth.
[03:14:36.020 --> 03:14:38.580]  You are part of the next newer dollar regime.
[03:14:38.580 --> 03:14:41.100]  And you hear, you know, these people are just psychotic.
[03:14:41.100 --> 03:14:46.820]  They use these terms, new world order, but you just come out and you, you post what they
[03:14:46.820 --> 03:14:53.580]  say you, you post this, you, you post literally what they say.
[03:14:53.580 --> 03:14:54.980]  You are the bad guy.
[03:14:54.980 --> 03:14:55.980]  Okay.
[03:14:55.980 --> 03:14:59.400]  You are the one that is called the conspiracy theorist, the liar.
[03:14:59.400 --> 03:15:03.260]  We all know that fact checkers are not fact checkers.
[03:15:03.260 --> 03:15:09.380]  We know that the fact checkers on big tech, they are designated authoritarian censors.
[03:15:09.380 --> 03:15:10.380]  That's what they are.
[03:15:10.380 --> 03:15:11.380]  1984.
[03:15:11.380 --> 03:15:12.940]  They are censoring the internet.
[03:15:12.940 --> 03:15:15.300]  They are censoring what everybody is saying.
[03:15:15.300 --> 03:15:20.300]  They are monitoring it and they are enforcing what the new world order wants to be said
[03:15:20.300 --> 03:15:21.620]  and what will not be said.
[03:15:21.620 --> 03:15:22.780]  Well, you know what?
[03:15:22.780 --> 03:15:24.300]  That's why we got banned out video.
[03:15:24.300 --> 03:15:25.300]  You know what?
[03:15:25.300 --> 03:15:26.700]  That's why we're here on info wars.com.
[03:15:26.700 --> 03:15:28.060]  Well, you know what?
[03:15:28.060 --> 03:15:32.660]  That's why we have the ability to have our own systems that are supported by the people.
[03:15:32.660 --> 03:15:33.660]  You're the people.
[03:15:33.660 --> 03:15:34.940]  That's every single one of you.
[03:15:34.940 --> 03:15:36.620]  And this is what we're fighting against.
[03:15:36.620 --> 03:15:37.620]  Every single day.
[03:15:37.620 --> 03:15:42.580]  It is a internal out in the open psyop that they're trying to run on.
[03:15:42.580 --> 03:15:48.620]  Not only the American people, but the absolute total population of humanity, warp their minds,
[03:15:48.620 --> 03:15:53.700]  warp their minds, propagate, propagate, propagate, go to info war store.com to keep this war
[03:15:53.700 --> 03:15:54.700]  going.

[03:15:55.700 --> 03:15:56.900]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:56.900 --> 03:16:00.780]  This is Adam King, host of the Adam King show, joined by the one and only Greg Reese of the
[03:16:00.780 --> 03:16:01.780]  Reese report.

[03:16:31.300 --> 03:16:36.380]  And we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[03:16:36.380 --> 03:16:41.020]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR, the real NPR of the base, right?

[03:16:57.980 --> 03:17:02.980]  A lot of people have asked me, why is info war store at info wars life, not at a probiotic
[03:17:02.980 --> 03:17:03.980]  for more than three years?
[03:17:03.980 --> 03:17:05.420]  And the answer is simple.
[03:17:05.420 --> 03:17:08.340]  We only bring you the highest quality, the lowest prices.
[03:17:08.340 --> 03:17:12.540]  We had a top maker, top certified of probiotics for more than seven years.
[03:17:12.540 --> 03:17:17.180]  They got bought by a Lybtard company and said, we're not doing business with you, Mr. Jones
[03:17:17.180 --> 03:17:18.180]  anymore.
[03:17:18.180 --> 03:17:24.180]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.
[03:17:24.180 --> 03:17:28.260]  We're able to private label it under info wars MD as our probiotic formula.

[03:17:54.180 --> 03:18:05.180]  Two of our bestselling nootropics or brain boosters are now back in stock at info wars
[03:18:05.180 --> 03:18:06.180]  store.com.
[03:18:06.180 --> 03:18:10.100]  And for a limited time, they're 50% off when you get them together or 40% off when you
[03:18:10.100 --> 03:18:11.220]  get them individually.
[03:18:11.220 --> 03:18:15.420]  Brain force plus and brain force ultra, two separate formulas.
[03:18:15.420 --> 03:18:18.420]  They both give you good clean energy without the crash.
[03:18:18.420 --> 03:18:23.900]  One is a four to six hour good base of clean energy, again with no hangover or letdown
[03:18:23.900 --> 03:18:28.580]  and the other is a very special proprietary formula that's brain force ultra that hits
[03:18:28.580 --> 03:18:29.580]  really, really quick.
[03:18:29.580 --> 03:18:30.580]  And I love it.
[03:18:30.580 --> 03:18:31.580]  It wears off in two to three hours.
[03:18:31.580 --> 03:18:34.220]  So if I've got to work at night, but don't want to stay up all night, I can take it and
[03:18:34.220 --> 03:18:37.620]  say nine o'clock at night, got to stay up till midnight working, doing a radio interview
[03:18:37.620 --> 03:18:42.820]  or something and boom, writing an article or writing a book and then I get two, three
[03:18:42.820 --> 03:18:44.940]  hours of energy and then you go right to bed after it.
[03:18:44.940 --> 03:18:50.220]  Brain force ultra, brain force plus, both 50% off by themselves or 40% off individually.
[03:18:50.220 --> 03:18:51.580]  A lot of people love these products.
[03:18:51.580 --> 03:18:55.060]  They've got five star reviews, but if you haven't tried them, you really should 50%
[03:18:55.060 --> 03:18:57.620]  off info or store.com.
[03:18:57.620 --> 03:18:58.620]  You wanted to plug brain force.
[03:18:58.620 --> 03:18:59.620]  Do you like brain force?
[03:18:59.620 --> 03:19:00.620]  Yeah.
[03:19:00.620 --> 03:19:01.620]  Yeah.
[03:19:01.620 --> 03:19:02.620]  So my name is Ken Hacken-Ladley.
[03:19:02.620 --> 03:19:04.660]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[03:19:04.660 --> 03:19:08.340]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkiewicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers
[03:19:08.340 --> 03:19:10.980]  and now two books with Alex Jones.
[03:19:10.980 --> 03:19:14.300]  That's because I use brain force every day.
[03:19:14.300 --> 03:19:18.220]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[03:19:18.220 --> 03:19:22.220]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[03:19:22.220 --> 03:19:27.620]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is brain force.
[03:19:27.620 --> 03:19:32.580]  I'll take brain force in the morning right before I go to my computer and I'm good for
[03:19:32.580 --> 03:19:35.460]  the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[03:19:35.460 --> 03:19:41.180]  So it really is true that brain force is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing.
[03:19:41.180 --> 03:19:42.180]  All right.
[03:19:42.180 --> 03:19:43.180]  We love you.
[03:19:43.180 --> 03:19:44.180]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:44.180 --> 03:19:47.380]  Get your brain force plus brain force ultra and turbo force at info or store.com.
[03:19:47.940 --> 03:19:49.060]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[03:19:57.940 --> 03:20:04.180]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:05.700 --> 03:20:20.220]  Sequence, sequence, sequence, the New World Order, the Deep State, they roll out their
[03:20:20.220 --> 03:20:26.900]  plans in a sequence of events because they are strategic, because they are working in
[03:20:26.900 --> 03:20:28.060]  unison.
[03:20:28.060 --> 03:20:30.060]  We all know there's a demonic component to this.
[03:20:30.060 --> 03:20:34.540]  It's all energized by the Antichrist spirit, all moving, just happening to be moving all
[03:20:34.540 --> 03:20:39.340]  in one direction, and the Bible just happens to tell us this is kind of what the end game
[03:20:39.340 --> 03:20:41.340]  is for humanity, right?
[03:20:41.340 --> 03:20:45.620]  You know, but the sequence of events, which is pretty interesting, that I wanted to talk
[03:20:45.620 --> 03:20:51.980]  about today, you know, we opened the show with, you know, just launching a nuclear red pill
[03:20:51.980 --> 03:20:55.840]  missile straight into the New World Order's face, because we have to.
[03:20:55.840 --> 03:20:58.000]  That's the existence of InfoWars every single day.
[03:20:58.000 --> 03:20:59.000]  This is what we do.
[03:20:59.000 --> 03:21:01.100]  That's why Band.Video exists.
[03:21:02.100 --> 03:21:06.420]  That's why they try to shut it down and discredit it, and lawfare, and shut down Alex, and sue
[03:21:06.420 --> 03:21:12.860]  him into the abyss, and everybody else that supports him, but, you know, by the way, go
[03:21:12.860 --> 03:21:17.620]  get your Alex Jones for president t-shirt 2024, go get it now, Band.Video.com, but you
[03:21:17.620 --> 03:21:24.900]  know, so when you take a look at their plans, it's the sequence of events, and it's not
[03:21:24.900 --> 03:21:31.900]  by coincidence, they don't operate with their hair on fire, running around trying to figure
[03:21:31.900 --> 03:21:33.140]  out what they're going to do.
[03:21:33.140 --> 03:21:34.700]  These people are intelligent.
[03:21:34.700 --> 03:21:38.020]  They are high IQs.
[03:21:38.020 --> 03:21:40.380]  These are people that come out of Ivy Leagues.
[03:21:40.380 --> 03:21:44.100]  These are people that, and I'm not talking about, you know, affirmative action, you know,
[03:21:44.100 --> 03:21:48.380]  a woke black person that just got there because, well, I'm woke and black, so yeah, give me
[03:21:48.380 --> 03:21:53.860]  my master's degree from Harvard, yeah, now put me in the Oval Office, yeah, huh.
[03:21:53.860 --> 03:21:54.860]  I'm not talking about that.
[03:21:54.860 --> 03:21:59.380]  I'm talking about dealing with some seriously intellectually advanced people.
[03:21:59.380 --> 03:22:03.340]  You look at people like Bill Gates, seriously intellectually advanced.
[03:22:03.340 --> 03:22:07.900]  You take a look at people like Jeffrey Epstein, alright, to be able to pull that kind of pedophile
[03:22:07.900 --> 03:22:14.740]  ring for that long, not only in deep state American politics, but Hollywood, various
[03:22:14.740 --> 03:22:19.940]  different channels in cultural society, getting people on board, blackmailing high prominent
[03:22:19.940 --> 03:22:24.740]  powerful people, literally getting them under your thumb.
[03:22:24.740 --> 03:22:28.260]  Takes a very advanced intellectual type of person to do that, and I'm not saying that
[03:22:28.260 --> 03:22:29.540]  to praise them.
[03:22:29.540 --> 03:22:34.900]  I'm just saying, don't underestimate your opponent, don't you ever, ever.
[03:22:34.900 --> 03:22:39.960]  That is the worst mistake that you could ever make when it comes to dealing with the New
[03:22:39.960 --> 03:22:45.060]  World Order, their proxies, their pawns, their agents, their organizations.
[03:22:45.060 --> 03:22:50.100]  The biggest mistake that you and I can make when dealing with these people is simply underestimating
[03:22:50.100 --> 03:22:52.260]  them, underestimating them, alright.
[03:22:52.260 --> 03:22:54.700]  The biggest mistake is someone that just will not take the red pill.
[03:22:54.700 --> 03:22:56.100]  We've talked about this, right?
[03:22:56.100 --> 03:22:59.780]  Morpheus says, here you go, Alex Jones hands you the red pill, you just deny it.
[03:22:59.780 --> 03:23:04.860]  You say it's not real, you refuse to take it, but then you can get someone that's totally
[03:23:04.860 --> 03:23:08.820]  red pilled, but then gets kind of complacent, and then you get in this place in your life
[03:23:08.820 --> 03:23:15.300]  where you start underestimating these people, and it's a dangerous place to be.
[03:23:15.300 --> 03:23:20.180]  We're dealing with people that have war chests of billions, possibly trillions of dollars,
[03:23:20.180 --> 03:23:21.180]  alright.
[03:23:21.420 --> 03:23:24.700]  Some of these oil companies and these guys that are backed behind them, they finesse
[03:23:24.700 --> 03:23:28.460]  their way financially to make sure that it's not absolutely tied to them.
[03:23:28.460 --> 03:23:32.780]  We've got trillionaires on planet Earth, alright.
[03:23:32.780 --> 03:23:38.300]  If the Forbes list was real, you would have Saudis, you had all these dudes from the Middle
[03:23:38.300 --> 03:23:43.100]  East that are multi-trillionaires, alright, but I think a lot of these people like to
[03:23:43.100 --> 03:23:44.100]  stay low-key.
[03:23:44.100 --> 03:23:46.060]  They like to stay low-key.
[03:23:46.060 --> 03:23:50.180]  They like to kind of stay off the radar, and that's smart.
[03:23:50.180 --> 03:23:55.140]  A smart person, it's kind of like that movie American Gangster, remember American Gangster
[03:23:55.140 --> 03:24:00.260]  with Denzel Washington, a mafia dude, a straight gang, you know what I mean, like serious gang,
[03:24:00.260 --> 03:24:04.940]  like straight drug pushing cartels, like these dudes.
[03:24:04.940 --> 03:24:08.540]  Remember Denzel Washington would tell his family when he recruited his family, when
[03:24:08.540 --> 03:24:14.620]  he became the next drug lord in his city, and his family came, they were all like trying
[03:24:14.620 --> 03:24:20.100]  to be like ghetto fabulous, ghetto flashy, and he'll tell them, you will stick out like
[03:24:20.100 --> 03:24:23.020]  a sore thumb, alright.
[03:24:23.020 --> 03:24:24.860]  That's what the feds look for.
[03:24:24.860 --> 03:24:26.100]  That's what the cops look for.
[03:24:26.100 --> 03:24:29.260]  They look for the one that comes in that doesn't belong, that's all flashy.
[03:24:29.260 --> 03:24:32.580]  They want to see a black guy that looks all flashy running around, how did he get that
[03:24:32.580 --> 03:24:33.580]  money?
[03:24:33.580 --> 03:24:36.820]  Oh, well let's investigate, let's put him away in jail forever.
[03:24:36.820 --> 03:24:41.900]  That's the mindset, you know, these high IQ criminals, they think that way.
[03:24:41.900 --> 03:24:43.940]  They don't want to be running around flashy.
[03:24:43.940 --> 03:24:45.700]  They don't want a target on their back.
[03:24:45.700 --> 03:24:50.540]  They don't want to be seen as this destructive figure that is going to take down humanity.
[03:24:50.540 --> 03:24:54.020]  That's why they all appear to be humanitarian, have you guys noticed that?
[03:24:54.020 --> 03:24:59.700]  John Kerry, Klaus Schwab, all of their little programs with the World Economic Forum, climate
[03:24:59.700 --> 03:25:03.020]  change, that climate change cult, they all want to save the world.
[03:25:03.020 --> 03:25:04.020]  It sounds very virtuous.
[03:25:04.020 --> 03:25:09.860]  They have this messianic God complex, this messiah complex where only they have the message
[03:25:10.020 --> 03:25:15.820]  and they have the solutions and they are the chosen ones to save all of mankind.
[03:25:15.820 --> 03:25:18.700]  But the kicker is, well, if you don't listen to us, you're all going to die and get locked
[03:25:18.700 --> 03:25:22.420]  out of the next, you know, utopian economy, the 10 minute city, you're going to get locked
[03:25:22.420 --> 03:25:23.420]  out of all this.
[03:25:23.420 --> 03:25:26.900]  The futuristic AI virtual reality economy, you're going to get locked out of the cashless
[03:25:26.900 --> 03:25:27.900]  society.
[03:25:27.900 --> 03:25:30.340]  If you don't obey us, you are done.
[03:25:30.340 --> 03:25:33.060]  They're like saviors with strings attached.
[03:25:33.060 --> 03:25:36.300]  They're saviors with a contract.
[03:25:36.300 --> 03:25:37.300]  They're not saviors.
[03:25:37.300 --> 03:25:41.980]  They're what Jesus said that we would see are false messiahs.
[03:25:41.980 --> 03:25:46.060]  And I definitely think the climate cult falls in that category.
[03:25:46.060 --> 03:25:50.460]  But these people, they, like I said, you notice, you pay attention to the way they talk.
[03:25:50.460 --> 03:25:53.540]  You pay attention to the way they give their speeches.
[03:25:53.540 --> 03:25:59.140]  It sounds very convincing, very convincing humanitarian effort.
[03:25:59.140 --> 03:26:01.520]  We're going to help the third world.
[03:26:01.520 --> 03:26:05.420]  We're going to help those that are impoverished in third world countries.
[03:26:05.420 --> 03:26:07.580]  We're going to pull them out of poverty.
[03:26:07.580 --> 03:26:13.740]  All of our plans are to ensure the human race survives for the next 100 years.
[03:26:13.740 --> 03:26:15.540]  They all talk like this, right?
[03:26:15.540 --> 03:26:18.420]  Like they're so confident that they're the ones that are going to save planet Earth.
[03:26:18.420 --> 03:26:24.260]  And they're the only ones that can, like nobody else can, no one else can, but them, right?
[03:26:24.260 --> 03:26:29.660]  Especially for Americans, nobody else can ensure the survival for the United States
[03:26:29.660 --> 03:26:34.500]  of America, for us to thrive, whether tech and not technologically, spiritually, economically,
[03:26:34.500 --> 03:26:35.500]  you name it, right?
[03:26:35.500 --> 03:26:36.500]  Nobody else.
[03:26:36.500 --> 03:26:37.500]  Nope.
[03:26:37.500 --> 03:26:38.500]  Nope.
[03:26:38.500 --> 03:26:40.780]  Americans, you stupid Americans, you have no idea what you're doing.
[03:26:40.780 --> 03:26:43.700]  You need the UN.
[03:26:43.700 --> 03:26:45.660]  They just talked about this in the last segment.
[03:26:45.660 --> 03:26:50.540]  The UN is getting ready in the next couple months to seize emergency powers in the United
[03:26:50.540 --> 03:26:53.980]  States of America for their next emergency to be declared.
[03:26:53.980 --> 03:26:58.220]  And not only will they seize powers once they announce it, they will set the timeline as
[03:26:58.220 --> 03:26:59.980]  well, right?
[03:26:59.980 --> 03:27:02.360]  They will see, they will announce the next pandemic.
[03:27:02.360 --> 03:27:04.900]  They will announce the next climate change hysteria.
[03:27:04.900 --> 03:27:10.080]  They will announce their next new world order operation to lock everybody down, total obedience,
[03:27:10.080 --> 03:27:11.880]  sacrifice freedom for security.
[03:27:11.880 --> 03:27:16.120]  You must do this as a good citizen for thy neighbor in the new world order, the Antichrist
[03:27:16.120 --> 03:27:18.160]  regime, correct?
[03:27:18.160 --> 03:27:22.360]  And not only will they have the emergency powers, not only will they announce what the emergency
[03:27:22.360 --> 03:27:25.240]  is, they will have the emergency powers.
[03:27:25.240 --> 03:27:30.360]  They will have the legal basis to do so because the puppet Biden regime is not going to say
[03:27:30.360 --> 03:27:32.800]  or have any pushback about it.
[03:27:32.800 --> 03:27:33.800]  They're just going to allow it.
[03:27:33.800 --> 03:27:34.800]  That's why he's there.
[03:27:34.800 --> 03:27:35.800]  Does it make sense now?
[03:27:35.800 --> 03:27:37.240]  I've been saying this for months.
[03:27:37.240 --> 03:27:38.760]  Why was Biden installed?
[03:27:38.760 --> 03:27:39.800]  He's just a vegetable.
[03:27:39.800 --> 03:27:41.000]  He doesn't know anything.
[03:27:41.000 --> 03:27:42.680]  He can't navigate anywhere.
[03:27:42.680 --> 03:27:44.000]  And that is by design.
[03:27:44.000 --> 03:27:48.320]  So when the UN comes along and says, we want emergency powers, the next time you guys have
[03:27:48.320 --> 03:27:51.080]  an emergency in your country, oh, well, here you go.
[03:27:51.080 --> 03:27:52.080]  Where's Ashley?
[03:27:52.080 --> 03:27:53.080]  I mean, just go have sex with my daughter.
[03:27:53.080 --> 03:27:54.080]  That's all I care about.
[03:27:54.080 --> 03:27:56.200]  Oh, don't ask me anything else.
[03:27:56.200 --> 03:27:58.060]  That's how it works, guys.
[03:27:58.060 --> 03:28:00.000]  That's what's happening to us.
[03:28:00.640 --> 03:28:04.400]  The Americans, you are too stupid to pull yourself up from your own bootstraps.
[03:28:04.400 --> 03:28:05.400]  You don't have your own autonomy.
[03:28:05.400 --> 03:28:07.800]  You don't have your own power.
[03:28:07.800 --> 03:28:08.800]  That's fine.
[03:28:08.800 --> 03:28:09.800]  United States of America.
[03:28:09.800 --> 03:28:10.800]  You guys fled tyranny.
[03:28:10.800 --> 03:28:11.800]  Well, it's back, baby.
[03:28:11.800 --> 03:28:12.800]  You guys fled tyranny.
[03:28:12.800 --> 03:28:14.040]  Well, it's back, baby.
[03:28:14.040 --> 03:28:17.280]  Well, we know how Americans deal with tyrants.
[03:28:17.280 --> 03:28:20.600]  We don't call for violence, but we will defend ourselves from violent tyranny.
[03:28:20.600 --> 03:28:21.600]  I'll tell you that right now.
[03:28:21.600 --> 03:28:22.600]  Seventeen seventy six.
[03:28:22.600 --> 03:28:23.600]  I'm not calling for violence.
[03:28:23.600 --> 03:28:26.400]  But what I'm saying is these people want tyranny.
[03:28:26.400 --> 03:28:28.240]  Well, we want freedom.
[03:28:28.240 --> 03:28:33.080]  And we know that that is a recipe for freedom to win.
[03:28:33.080 --> 03:28:35.520]  I'll just say that that is a recipe for freedom to win.
[03:28:35.520 --> 03:28:38.600]  But they believe that they know better than us.
[03:28:38.600 --> 03:28:44.360]  These foreign entities, these foreign organizations that have no business dictating what the United
[03:28:44.360 --> 03:28:48.640]  States of America is going to do, you're going to tell me as an American how my country is
[03:28:48.640 --> 03:28:49.640]  going to go.
[03:28:49.640 --> 03:28:50.640]  Yeah.
[03:28:50.640 --> 03:28:51.640]  No, thanks.
[03:28:51.640 --> 03:28:52.640]  America first.
[03:28:52.640 --> 03:28:53.640]  Get the hell out of here.
[03:28:53.640 --> 03:28:54.640]  Infowars.com.
[03:28:54.640 --> 03:28:55.640]  Video.
[03:28:55.800 --> 03:29:03.800]  We have three original, one of a kind toothpaste designed by my father, a dentist at Infowars.com
[03:29:03.800 --> 03:29:08.000]  that don't have fillers that are filled with high quality essential oils and more.
[03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:10.440]  We have the turmeric toothpaste.
[03:29:10.440 --> 03:29:13.600]  We have the ultimate tooth whitening with real calcium toothpaste.
[03:29:13.600 --> 03:29:17.900]  And we have the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste, again, with a whole bunch of key
[03:29:17.900 --> 03:29:21.880]  essential oils that are so good, not for your teeth and your gums, but your whole mouth,
[03:29:21.880 --> 03:29:23.100]  your throat and more.
[03:29:23.100 --> 03:29:25.160]  These are really game changing toothpaste.
[03:29:25.160 --> 03:29:26.600]  They're very, very strong.
[03:29:26.600 --> 03:29:28.560]  Most over-the-counter toothpaste have fluoride.
[03:29:28.560 --> 03:29:29.560]  Ours don't.
[03:29:29.560 --> 03:29:31.040]  And it doesn't have fillers in it.
[03:29:31.040 --> 03:29:37.040]  It is just chock full of incredible things that God gave us through mother nature.
[03:29:37.040 --> 03:29:38.800]  So it's now back in stock.
[03:29:38.800 --> 03:29:40.520]  It became a bestseller.
[03:29:40.520 --> 03:29:43.840]  The turmeric toothpaste is available again at Infowars.com.
[03:29:43.840 --> 03:29:45.240]  We're selling out of the tooth whitening toothpaste.
[03:29:45.240 --> 03:29:46.240]  We've got some of that left.
[03:29:46.240 --> 03:29:49.960]  And we also have some of the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste in stock, but it's running
[03:29:49.960 --> 03:29:50.960]  out as well.
[03:29:50.960 --> 03:29:54.400]  So all three toothpastes in stock for a limited time, Infowars.com.
[03:29:56.160 --> 03:30:01.200]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?
[03:30:01.200 --> 03:30:03.840]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[03:30:03.840 --> 03:30:05.400]  So let me get this straight.
[03:30:05.400 --> 03:30:09.360]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document showing that during the
[03:30:09.360 --> 03:30:13.760]  Obama administration, Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son Hunter to force
[03:30:13.760 --> 03:30:17.960]  the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption, an event that
[03:30:17.960 --> 03:30:22.400]  Donald Trump looked into, sparking the first impeachment and forcing the arming of Ukraine,
[03:30:22.400 --> 03:30:25.320]  in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia.
[03:30:25.320 --> 03:30:30.000]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop, which the FBI also had, but that they
[03:30:30.000 --> 03:30:35.760]  swore was Russian disinformation and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign,
[03:30:35.760 --> 03:30:40.440]  all while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents, despite the FBI admittedly
[03:30:40.440 --> 03:30:44.880]  letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016 when they were simultaneously
[03:30:44.880 --> 03:30:49.000]  launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump using falsified evidence provided
[03:30:49.000 --> 03:30:51.440]  by the Clinton campaign.
[03:30:51.440 --> 03:30:53.440]  Do I have that all straight?
[03:31:22.320 --> 03:31:27.760]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[03:31:27.760 --> 03:31:32.920]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name
[03:31:32.920 --> 03:31:33.920]  it.
[03:31:33.920 --> 03:31:37.720]  It is the super fuel.
[03:31:37.720 --> 03:31:39.160]  Rainforce Plus is great.
[03:31:39.160 --> 03:31:40.160]  Rainforce Ultra is great.
[03:31:40.160 --> 03:31:41.160]  There are two different nootropics.
[03:31:41.160 --> 03:31:42.160]  They go good with this.
[03:31:42.160 --> 03:31:44.680]  But this is the King Kong.
[03:31:44.680 --> 03:31:46.280]  This is the boss.
[03:31:46.280 --> 03:31:47.280]  Rainforce.
[03:31:47.280 --> 03:31:48.280]  Back in stock.
[03:31:48.280 --> 03:31:49.280]  Discounted.

[03:31:50.280 --> 03:31:56.240]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[03:31:56.240 --> 03:32:02.640]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity,
[03:32:02.640 --> 03:32:05.840]  the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[03:32:05.840 --> 03:32:10.160]  You are crazy, in my view, if you don't get high quality, storable food and water filtration
[03:32:10.160 --> 03:32:11.160]  and self-defense.
[03:32:11.160 --> 03:32:13.320]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[03:32:13.320 --> 03:32:15.920]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[03:32:16.560 --> 03:32:17.880]  And I preach to the choir on that.
[03:32:17.880 --> 03:32:21.760]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water
[03:32:21.760 --> 03:32:22.800]  filtration.
[03:32:22.800 --> 03:32:24.480]  This is something you need now.
[03:32:24.480 --> 03:32:29.000]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.
[03:32:29.000 --> 03:32:33.280]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find
[03:32:33.280 --> 03:32:35.200]  and still get quality.

[03:32:45.320 --> 03:32:47.560]  Our prices are already the lowest at 10% off.
[03:32:47.560 --> 03:32:49.520]  It's an insane deal for a limited time.
[03:32:49.520 --> 03:32:53.480]  Go to infowarsstore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[03:32:56.200 --> 03:33:02.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:11.200 --> 03:33:15.200]  Strategic plans, back to the sequence of events.
[03:33:15.200 --> 03:33:21.200]  The reason why I'm talking like this is I think this month, past couple months,
[03:33:22.200 --> 03:33:28.200]  very interesting, very interesting sequence of events.
[03:33:28.200 --> 03:33:31.200]  Say, Drew, what are you talking about?
[03:33:31.200 --> 03:33:37.200]  What we witnessed during Groomer Month this past June, I think was next level.
[03:33:37.200 --> 03:33:44.200]  You saw naked homosexuals, boomers, literally naked boomer homosexuals
[03:33:44.200 --> 03:33:49.200]  walking around Seattle with their penises hanging out with little boys, children, hundreds, hundreds.
[03:33:50.200 --> 03:33:55.200]  Just watching, smiling like it's totally normal, like they're at Disneyland.
[03:33:55.200 --> 03:33:59.200]  We saw a bunch of land whale walrus lesbians in New York.
[03:33:59.200 --> 03:34:02.200]  I think it was Savannah Hernandez that covered this.
[03:34:02.200 --> 03:34:09.200]  Bunch of walrus land whale lesbians with their disgusting blubber breasts
[03:34:09.200 --> 03:34:14.200]  bouncing around with children running around in the water, like flapping around like a bunch of walruses.
[03:34:14.200 --> 03:34:17.200]  Playing in the water, playing in the fountains.
[03:34:18.200 --> 03:34:22.200]  Bunch of AIDS and HIV spreading all over the place.
[03:34:22.200 --> 03:34:25.200]  We saw some pretty dark stuff.
[03:34:25.200 --> 03:34:32.200]  I covered one in Tempe, Arizona, some homosexual rapper that claimed to be divine, claims to be a god.
[03:34:32.200 --> 03:34:39.200]  Getting up on stage rapping about getting sodomized and sodomizing men in front of little girls, little kids.
[03:34:39.200 --> 03:34:44.200]  We've seen a lot of this stuff, and it can get desensitizing sometimes.
[03:34:44.200 --> 03:34:47.200]  You see it so much, you're like, well, I guess that's America now.
[03:34:47.200 --> 03:34:49.200]  BAM! Right?
[03:34:49.200 --> 03:34:51.200]  No, we can never get desensitized.
[03:34:51.200 --> 03:34:53.200]  This should trigger you in a righteous way.
[03:34:53.200 --> 03:34:57.200]  Not trigger you like a leftist, a snowflake, where you can't hear anything that's offensive,
[03:34:57.200 --> 03:35:00.200]  and oh my god, let's just censor everybody.
[03:35:00.200 --> 03:35:02.200]  No, trigger like, we got pedophiles here!
[03:35:02.200 --> 03:35:06.200]  We got pedophiles walking the streets with their genitals out!
[03:35:06.200 --> 03:35:09.200]  We got parents taking them to the pedophiles!
[03:35:09.200 --> 03:35:11.200]  That should righteously trigger you!
[03:35:11.200 --> 03:35:14.200]  Let's throw some people in jail! Come on!
[03:35:14.200 --> 03:35:18.200]  Let's send a message to society that this is not going to fly with us!
[03:35:18.200 --> 03:35:21.200]  That's what I'm talking about.
[03:35:21.200 --> 03:35:25.200]  But, you know, this was a very dark month.
[03:35:25.200 --> 03:35:28.200]  Right? We saw Target get exposed.
[03:35:28.200 --> 03:35:37.200]  We're working alongside of a designer that is open about their Satanism and Satanic clothing for children.
[03:35:38.200 --> 03:35:40.200]  This is all manifesting, guys.
[03:35:40.200 --> 03:35:42.200]  These are manifestations of evil.
[03:35:42.200 --> 03:35:43.200]  Alright?
[03:35:43.200 --> 03:35:50.200]  These are manifestations of these demonic influences that are influencing fallen humanity that's reprobate,
[03:35:50.200 --> 03:35:51.200]  and you're seeing it.
[03:35:51.200 --> 03:35:52.200]  People are seeing it.
[03:35:52.200 --> 03:35:53.200]  That's why they're getting red-pilled.
[03:35:53.200 --> 03:35:54.200]  They're getting Christ-pilled.
[03:35:54.200 --> 03:35:55.200]  They're getting God-pilled.
[03:35:55.200 --> 03:35:56.200]  They're like, well, that's in the Bible?
[03:35:56.200 --> 03:35:57.200]  Yeah, man.
[03:35:57.200 --> 03:35:58.200]  It is, dude.
[03:35:58.200 --> 03:36:00.200]  And we've been trying to warn people for decades,
[03:36:00.200 --> 03:36:03.200]  but maybe now you're awake because you want your evidence?
[03:36:03.200 --> 03:36:06.200]  You want to see to believe?
[03:36:06.200 --> 03:36:11.200]  Go read Romans chapter 1 and then go relive Pride Month 2023
[03:36:11.200 --> 03:36:16.200]  and come back and tell me that God doesn't exist and is not speaking through the word of God.
[03:36:16.200 --> 03:36:17.200]  Alright?
[03:36:17.200 --> 03:36:18.200]  There you go.
[03:36:18.200 --> 03:36:21.200]  There you go.
[03:36:21.200 --> 03:36:25.200]  So Pedophile Month gets amplified to the next level.
[03:36:25.200 --> 03:36:26.200]  Right?
[03:36:26.200 --> 03:36:31.200]  Pedophile Month gets amplified to the next level in 2023,
[03:36:31.200 --> 03:36:34.200]  and then you've got this movie Sound of Freedom that's going to drop
[03:36:34.200 --> 03:36:36.200]  and we've been trying to suppress for years.
[03:36:36.200 --> 03:36:38.200]  I just think the timing is interesting.
[03:36:38.200 --> 03:36:41.200]  These sequence of events, right?
[03:36:41.200 --> 03:36:43.200]  See this rise in pedophilia and grooming,
[03:36:43.200 --> 03:36:49.200]  these homosexuals trying to normalize it, add that P to the LGBTQ, whatever, right?
[03:36:49.200 --> 03:36:53.200]  And then Sound of Freedom drops July 4th, Patriot Month,
[03:36:53.200 --> 03:36:56.200]  and the sequence of events is astounding.
[03:36:56.200 --> 03:37:01.200]  It's truly astounding to see the normalization of pedophilia has gone into overdrive, you guys.
[03:37:01.200 --> 03:37:02.200]  It truly has.
[03:37:02.200 --> 03:37:06.200]  Like, this stuff is accelerating and it's accelerating fast
[03:37:06.200 --> 03:37:09.200]  because you could tell by the way that they respond to it.
[03:37:09.200 --> 03:37:13.200]  They're trying to normalize pedophilia at these groomer rallies, these groomer marches.
[03:37:13.200 --> 03:37:16.200]  In the United States of America, the homosexuals just walking around naked
[03:37:16.200 --> 03:37:18.200]  with their penises hanging out in front of children.
[03:37:18.200 --> 03:37:19.200]  Alright?
[03:37:19.200 --> 03:37:20.200]  That's what it is, man.
[03:37:20.200 --> 03:37:23.200]  Oh, and by the way, Tim Cass, when they covered also in New York,
[03:37:23.200 --> 03:37:25.200]  you got all the homosexuals running around saying,
[03:37:25.200 --> 03:37:28.200]  We're here, we're queer, we're coming for your children!
[03:37:28.200 --> 03:37:30.200]  We're here, we're queer, we're coming for your children!
[03:37:30.200 --> 03:37:33.200]  Just out in the open.
[03:37:33.200 --> 03:37:36.200]  And then in California, they literally legislated that if you don't,
[03:37:36.200 --> 03:37:40.200]  if you don't accept your child's self-identifying pronouns,
[03:37:40.200 --> 03:37:42.200]  then we will take your child.
[03:37:42.200 --> 03:37:43.200]  That's child abuse.
[03:37:43.200 --> 03:37:44.200]  This is accelerating.
[03:37:44.200 --> 03:37:47.200]  In the month of June, just stay with me, alright?
[03:37:47.200 --> 03:37:48.200]  Stay with me.
[03:37:48.200 --> 03:37:51.200]  Sequence, sequence, sequence.
[03:37:51.200 --> 03:37:54.200]  Then I find it interesting that Sound of Freedom drops.
[03:37:54.200 --> 03:37:55.200]  Damn, man.
[03:37:55.200 --> 03:37:57.200]  Wow.
[03:37:57.200 --> 03:37:59.200]  You see Rolling Stone.
[03:37:59.200 --> 03:38:00.200]  You see The Guardian.
[03:38:00.200 --> 03:38:02.200]  You see that news publication Jezebel.
[03:38:02.200 --> 03:38:05.200]  They're all calling it QAnon adjacent.
[03:38:05.200 --> 03:38:11.200]  They're calling it like a, you know, just a total conspiracy.
[03:38:11.200 --> 03:38:13.200]  None of it has any validity.
[03:38:13.200 --> 03:38:15.200]  It's all tied to QAnon.
[03:38:15.200 --> 03:38:18.200]  They try to discredit Jim Caviezel.
[03:38:18.200 --> 03:38:21.200]  They try to discredit the producers, the directors.
[03:38:21.200 --> 03:38:25.200]  They try to discredit the actual guy that the movie's made about
[03:38:25.200 --> 03:38:28.200]  that does this, that has been doing this for decades,
[03:38:28.200 --> 03:38:32.200]  fighting against child sex trafficking, exposing pedophile rings,
[03:38:32.200 --> 03:38:34.200]  elites, low-level people.
[03:38:34.200 --> 03:38:37.200]  But why does it always end up being the elites involved with pedophilia?
[03:38:37.200 --> 03:38:38.200]  You want to know why?
[03:38:38.200 --> 03:38:41.200]  Because they're the ones that could truly afford this kind of stuff.
[03:38:41.200 --> 03:38:42.200]  There's a reason for that.
[03:38:42.200 --> 03:38:44.200]  It's not cheap, alright?
[03:38:44.200 --> 03:38:48.200]  Child sex trafficking is not, it's not cheap to just go purchase
[03:38:48.200 --> 03:38:50.200]  an eight-year-old boy and sodomize the hell out of him
[03:38:50.200 --> 03:38:52.200]  for however long you want.
[03:38:52.200 --> 03:38:54.200]  This is not cheap stuff, you guys.
[03:38:54.200 --> 03:38:57.200]  This is a multibillion-dollar daily,
[03:38:57.200 --> 03:39:00.200]  multibillion-dollar industry, alright?
[03:39:00.200 --> 03:39:03.200]  So there's a reason why the elites are more typically involved
[03:39:03.200 --> 03:39:06.200]  with this kind of stuff because they can fork up the cash
[03:39:06.200 --> 03:39:09.200]  like it's nothing, baby, and they also can fork up the cash
[03:39:09.200 --> 03:39:12.200]  to make it all go away if they need to,
[03:39:12.200 --> 03:39:13.200]  blackmail whoever they need to.
[03:39:13.200 --> 03:39:16.200]  Anyways, the response has been astounding.
[03:39:16.200 --> 03:39:18.200]  It truly has been.
[03:39:18.200 --> 03:39:20.200]  You see the pedophile occult media try to discredit
[03:39:20.200 --> 03:39:22.200]  all these news publications.
[03:39:22.200 --> 03:39:25.200]  It's QAnon, QAnon adjacent, QAnon conspiracy.
[03:39:25.200 --> 03:39:26.200]  Did you guys see that guy?
[03:39:26.200 --> 03:39:28.200]  I think it was Mike Rothschild.
[03:39:28.200 --> 03:39:30.200]  Of all last names.
[03:39:30.200 --> 03:39:33.200]  Mike Rothschild on CNN.
[03:39:33.200 --> 03:39:37.200]  He literally said that the Sound of Freedom movie,
[03:39:37.200 --> 03:39:40.200]  okay, it's made, these kind of movies are made
[03:39:40.200 --> 03:39:43.200]  off of bogus statistics.
[03:39:43.200 --> 03:39:45.200]  Moral panics.
[03:39:45.200 --> 03:39:46.200]  What's a moral panic?
[03:39:46.200 --> 03:39:49.200]  Shouldn't we be morally panicked to want to do something
[03:39:49.200 --> 03:39:53.200]  to save children that are being child sex trafficked?
[03:39:53.200 --> 03:39:56.200]  That absolutely warrants a moral panic.
[03:39:56.200 --> 03:39:57.200]  We should all be doing something.
[03:39:57.200 --> 03:40:01.200]  Alert, alert, alert, society, civilization.
[03:40:01.200 --> 03:40:03.200]  The babies are being targeted.
[03:40:03.200 --> 03:40:04.200]  The babies are being raped.
[03:40:04.200 --> 03:40:06.200]  The babies are being sex trafficked.
[03:40:06.200 --> 03:40:08.200]  Alert, alert, state emergency.
[03:40:08.200 --> 03:40:10.200]  We must do something.
[03:40:10.200 --> 03:40:11.200]  Who are the perpetrators?
[03:40:11.200 --> 03:40:12.200]  Who are the criminals?
[03:40:12.200 --> 03:40:13.200]  Who needs to go down?
[03:40:13.200 --> 03:40:15.200]  Who needs to be legally and lawfully executed
[03:40:15.200 --> 03:40:17.200]  according to the laws of the land?
[03:40:17.200 --> 03:40:20.200]  Who, who, who, who is doing this to the babies?
[03:40:21.200 --> 03:40:23.200]  Oh, but a moral panic is a bad thing
[03:40:23.200 --> 03:40:25.200]  according to the CNN talking head.
[03:40:25.200 --> 03:40:29.200]  Mike Rothschild, of all people, wild.
[03:40:29.200 --> 03:40:32.200]  Oh yeah, there he is.
[03:40:32.200 --> 03:40:34.200]  Mike Rothschild, of all people.
[03:40:34.200 --> 03:40:37.200]  You got a Rothschild telling you that Sound of Freedom
[03:40:37.200 --> 03:40:39.200]  is based off of bogus statistics.
[03:40:39.200 --> 03:40:41.200]  Yeah, I'll believe that, sure.
[03:40:41.200 --> 03:40:45.200]  Sure, I'll believe a Rothschild any day of the week.
[03:40:45.200 --> 03:40:47.200]  Any day of the week, just tell me, Daddy.
[03:40:47.200 --> 03:40:48.200]  Tell me, Daddy Rothschild.
[03:40:48.200 --> 03:40:49.200]  Tell me, Daddy.
[03:40:49.200 --> 03:40:50.200]  What do you want me to believe today?
[03:40:50.200 --> 03:40:52.200]  Oh, Daddy, just dictate me.
[03:40:52.200 --> 03:40:53.200]  Daddy, dictate me, baby.
[03:40:53.200 --> 03:40:55.200]  I just want to be dictated.
[03:40:55.200 --> 03:40:58.200]  Propagate my mind, Daddy.
[03:40:58.200 --> 03:40:59.200]  Wild.
[03:40:59.200 --> 03:41:02.200]  Yeah, he said it's based off of moral panic,
[03:41:02.200 --> 03:41:07.200]  bogus statistics, and fear.
[03:41:07.200 --> 03:41:08.200]  And fear.
[03:41:08.200 --> 03:41:10.200]  You know, it's just, it's so wild.
[03:41:10.200 --> 03:41:13.200]  Like, all of the things that warrant, you know,
[03:41:13.200 --> 03:41:17.200]  to mobilize us into action, to put a stop to something
[03:41:17.200 --> 03:41:19.200]  should not be Republican.
[03:41:19.200 --> 03:41:20.200]  This should not be Democrat.
[03:41:20.200 --> 03:41:23.200]  This should not be political outside of the sphere
[03:41:23.200 --> 03:41:27.200]  of only legislating to put a stop to this damn stuff.
[03:41:27.200 --> 03:41:29.200]  Like, there should be death penalties for all pedophiles,
[03:41:29.200 --> 03:41:32.200]  child sex traffickers, all this stuff, dude.
[03:41:32.200 --> 03:41:33.200]  I'm totally for that.
[03:41:33.200 --> 03:41:35.200]  That's how you send a message to society
[03:41:35.200 --> 03:41:36.200]  that you are not going to touch children.
[03:41:36.200 --> 03:41:38.200]  You are not going to sex traffic children.
[03:41:38.200 --> 03:41:40.200]  You are not going to rape children.
[03:41:40.200 --> 03:41:41.200]  If you do, you die.
[03:41:41.200 --> 03:41:45.200]  If you do, torture, torture, torture, torture, torture.
[03:41:46.200 --> 03:41:48.200]  Because that's what they're doing to the kids.
[03:41:48.200 --> 03:41:50.200]  They're torturing the kids.
[03:41:50.200 --> 03:41:52.200]  They're torturing them psychologically.
[03:41:52.200 --> 03:41:54.200]  They're torturing them physically.
[03:41:54.200 --> 03:41:56.200]  They're torturing them sexually.
[03:41:56.200 --> 03:41:58.200]  Eye for an eye, baby.
[03:41:58.200 --> 03:41:59.200]  You want to torture kids?
[03:41:59.200 --> 03:42:01.200]  Well, then you're going to get it too.
[03:42:01.200 --> 03:42:03.200]  That's how we should be in society.
[03:42:03.200 --> 03:42:05.200]  That's how you send a message to society,
[03:42:05.200 --> 03:42:08.200]  to criminals and pedophiles and child sex traffickers
[03:42:08.200 --> 03:42:10.200]  that this will be your fate.
[03:42:10.200 --> 03:42:13.200]  This will be your fate if you go after the innocent children.
[03:42:13.200 --> 03:42:16.200]  This will be your fate if you decide to go down that path.
[03:42:16.200 --> 03:42:19.200]  This will be your fate if you decide to disobey.
[03:42:21.200 --> 03:42:24.200]  But we live in a cucked out society where,
[03:42:24.200 --> 03:42:27.200]  you know, you'll see cuckservatives get all triggered
[03:42:27.200 --> 03:42:28.200]  based off of what I said.
[03:42:28.200 --> 03:42:29.200]  Oh, Drew, really?
[03:42:29.200 --> 03:42:30.200]  What, really?
[03:42:30.200 --> 03:42:31.200]  Yeah, really, baby.
[03:42:31.200 --> 03:42:32.200]  Yes.
[03:42:32.200 --> 03:42:33.200]  Really.
[03:42:33.200 --> 03:42:34.200]  Yes, really.
[03:42:34.200 --> 03:42:36.200]  Because this stuff is real.
[03:42:36.200 --> 03:42:41.200]  But I just find how the occult, satanic, pedophile media
[03:42:41.200 --> 03:42:45.200]  is running cover, trying to act like this stuff don't exist.
[03:42:45.200 --> 03:42:48.200]  We've been seeing this develop the last couple days,
[03:42:48.200 --> 03:42:50.200]  and then there's more of the sequence.
[03:42:50.200 --> 03:42:52.200]  I'll tell you about that when we come back from the break.
[03:42:52.200 --> 03:42:53.200]  Do not go anywhere.
[03:42:53.200 --> 03:42:54.200]  Blast all the links.
[03:42:54.200 --> 03:42:55.200]  Do it now.
[03:42:55.200 --> 03:42:56.200]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:56.200 --> 03:42:58.200]  With all the craziness in the world,
[03:42:58.200 --> 03:43:01.200]  the collapsing borders, the war with Russia,
[03:43:01.200 --> 03:43:04.200]  the insanity, the currency devaluations,
[03:43:04.200 --> 03:43:06.200]  the economy going crazy,
[03:43:06.200 --> 03:43:08.200]  you are crazy in my view if you don't get
[03:43:08.200 --> 03:43:11.200]  high-quality storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[03:43:11.200 --> 03:43:13.200]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[03:43:13.200 --> 03:43:15.200]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself
[03:43:15.200 --> 03:43:16.200]  and learn how to use if you haven't,
[03:43:16.200 --> 03:43:18.200]  and I'm preaching the choir on that.
[03:43:18.200 --> 03:43:20.200]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns,
[03:43:20.200 --> 03:43:23.200]  but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[03:43:23.200 --> 03:43:25.200]  This is something you need now,
[03:43:25.200 --> 03:43:27.200]  and we've got it in the food department
[03:43:27.200 --> 03:43:29.200]  and in the high-quality water filtration department.
[03:43:29.200 --> 03:43:32.200]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration
[03:43:32.200 --> 03:43:35.200]  at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.
[03:43:35.200 --> 03:43:37.200]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now
[03:43:37.200 --> 03:43:40.200]  for 10% off on all storable food
[03:43:40.200 --> 03:43:42.200]  and on water and air filtration.
[03:43:42.200 --> 03:43:45.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[03:43:45.200 --> 03:43:47.200]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[03:43:47.200 --> 03:43:49.200]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal.
[03:43:49.200 --> 03:43:52.200]  For a limited time, go to infowarsstore.com
[03:43:52.200 --> 03:43:54.200]  and get prepared while you still can.
[03:43:56.200 --> 03:44:02.200]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth,
[03:44:02.200 --> 03:44:04.200]  and they've got our children drinking that.
[03:44:04.200 --> 03:44:08.200]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed,
[03:44:08.200 --> 03:44:10.200]  out to get you and your family.
[03:44:10.200 --> 03:44:12.200]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze,
[03:44:12.200 --> 03:44:15.200]  made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour group.
[03:44:15.200 --> 03:44:17.200]  It's been around about 15 years,
[03:44:17.200 --> 03:44:19.200]  became the biggest company in the last six.
[03:44:19.200 --> 03:44:21.200]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered
[03:44:21.200 --> 03:44:23.200]  the fancy best water filter system out there
[03:44:23.200 --> 03:44:25.200]  that sells for twice the price,
[03:44:25.200 --> 03:44:28.200]  and they made it as good in all the studies.
[03:44:28.200 --> 03:44:30.200]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels,
[03:44:30.200 --> 03:44:31.200]  thousands of chemicals.
[03:44:31.200 --> 03:44:33.200]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[03:44:33.200 --> 03:44:35.200]  There's four or five other filters out there
[03:44:35.200 --> 03:44:36.200]  that are just as good.
[03:44:36.200 --> 03:44:39.200]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system
[03:44:39.200 --> 03:44:41.200]  for half the price of the leading competitor.
[03:44:41.200 --> 03:44:44.200]  And the media says we're bad and a cult
[03:44:44.200 --> 03:44:46.200]  for telling you you should filter your water.
[03:44:46.200 --> 03:44:48.200]  You should also filter your shower water.
[03:44:48.200 --> 03:44:50.200]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[03:44:50.200 --> 03:44:51.200]  But I'm done talking about that.
[03:44:51.200 --> 03:44:54.200]  The point is, you can get the filters at infowarsstore.com.
[03:44:54.200 --> 03:44:55.200]  They're discounted right now.
[03:44:55.200 --> 03:44:56.200]  Finally back in stock.
[03:44:56.200 --> 03:44:59.200]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots
[03:44:59.200 --> 03:45:02.200]  or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[03:45:02.200 --> 03:45:04.200]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals
[03:45:04.200 --> 03:45:08.200]  that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[03:45:08.200 --> 03:45:12.200]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[03:45:12.200 --> 03:45:14.200]  The allowable level the government admits
[03:45:14.200 --> 03:45:16.200]  that they allow to be in your water supply
[03:45:16.200 --> 03:45:17.200]  is enough to sterilize you
[03:45:17.200 --> 03:45:21.200]  and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[03:45:21.200 --> 03:45:22.200]  Look it up.
[03:45:22.200 --> 03:45:24.200]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[03:45:24.200 --> 03:45:27.200]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there,
[03:45:27.200 --> 03:45:30.200]  highest rated at half the price of leading competitors,
[03:45:30.200 --> 03:45:33.200]  the Alexa Pure, ready to ship to you right now.
[03:45:33.200 --> 03:45:35.200]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[03:45:35.200 --> 03:45:37.200]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[03:45:37.200 --> 03:45:38.200]  It is amazing.
[03:45:38.200 --> 03:45:40.200]  It's great for your home, your business.
[03:45:40.200 --> 03:45:43.200]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[03:45:43.200 --> 03:45:44.200]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[03:45:44.200 --> 03:45:47.200]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body
[03:45:47.200 --> 03:45:48.200]  and counter the globalist onslaught.
[03:45:48.200 --> 03:45:50.200]  Get yours today at infowarsstore.com.
[03:45:50.200 --> 03:45:52.200]  For a limited time, we're running a 10% discount.
[03:45:52.200 --> 03:45:53.200]  That is a huge discount.
[03:45:53.200 --> 03:45:55.200]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[03:45:55.200 --> 03:45:56.200]  You need this filter.
[03:45:56.200 --> 03:45:58.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book,
[03:45:58.200 --> 03:46:00.200]  The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[03:46:00.200 --> 03:46:03.200]  is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words
[03:46:03.200 --> 03:46:04.200]  plan for our future.
[03:46:04.200 --> 03:46:06.200]  That is a hellish future.
[03:46:06.200 --> 03:46:08.200]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books,
[03:46:08.200 --> 03:46:09.200]  I guess they're starting to ban them,
[03:46:09.200 --> 03:46:12.200]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World
[03:46:12.200 --> 03:46:15.200]  at bookstores, Amazon, or infowarsstore.com.
[03:46:15.200 --> 03:46:18.200]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[03:46:18.200 --> 03:46:21.200]  after the signed copies we got run out.
[03:46:21.200 --> 03:46:23.200]  And there's about 1,000 left of them right now.
[03:46:23.200 --> 03:46:26.200]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[03:46:26.200 --> 03:46:28.200]  a signed copy, at infowarsstore.com.
[03:46:28.200 --> 03:46:32.200]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:46:32.200 --> 03:46:35.200]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[03:46:35.200 --> 03:46:38.200]  You'll also know that you help keep infowars on the air.
[03:46:38.200 --> 03:46:41.200]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book
[03:46:41.200 --> 03:46:42.200]  or unsigned copies.
[03:46:42.200 --> 03:46:45.200]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet
[03:46:45.200 --> 03:46:48.200]  to go to infowarsstore.com and get a signed copy
[03:46:48.200 --> 03:46:51.200]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library
[03:46:51.200 --> 03:46:53.200]  or give them to the local school.
[03:46:53.200 --> 03:46:54.200]  This is an infowar.
[03:46:54.200 --> 03:46:56.200]  I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[03:47:05.500 --> 03:47:17.180]  Hi guys, you are now watching the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.

[03:47:55.860 --> 03:47:57.720]  This is how you support free speech.
[03:47:57.720 --> 03:47:59.620]  This is how you keep the InfoWar going.
[03:48:00.620 --> 03:48:04.100]  All right, guys, let's continue talking about sequence.
[03:48:04.100 --> 03:48:09.860]  I've been noticing this, and I like to sit back and watch the world, pray, ask God to
[03:48:09.860 --> 03:48:14.820]  give me vision and give me sight to see things that I might be missing.
[03:48:14.820 --> 03:48:19.980]  I really have been doing that these past couple months, and I've seen this sequence.
[03:48:19.980 --> 03:48:27.260]  I saw this all groomer month, this attempt to normalize pedophilia, homosexuals roaming
[03:48:27.260 --> 03:48:31.980]  the streets naked with children, parents bringing their kids to them.
[03:48:31.980 --> 03:48:37.420]  The homosexuals running around saying, we're here, we're queer, we're coming for your children.
[03:48:37.420 --> 03:48:40.620]  Sound of Freedom drops July 4th.
[03:48:40.620 --> 03:48:45.660]  The pedophile occult media, all their news publications attempt to smear the hell out
[03:48:45.660 --> 03:48:46.660]  of it.
[03:48:46.660 --> 03:48:47.660]  It's just wild.
[03:48:47.660 --> 03:48:48.660]  It's so wild to see.
[03:48:48.660 --> 03:48:54.340]  Mike Rothschild telling you that the movie's based off of bogus statistics, attempting
[03:48:54.340 --> 03:48:58.140]  to discredit it entirely.
[03:48:58.140 --> 03:48:59.140]  And then you see this report.
[03:48:59.140 --> 03:49:00.140]  I think it's on InfoWars.com.
[03:49:00.140 --> 03:49:03.780]  I'm sure you guys can find it in a couple seconds.
[03:49:03.780 --> 03:49:08.140]  And then you see this report of the Biden DOJ removing from their official website,
[03:49:08.140 --> 03:49:13.620]  official intel that's been around for decades of the realities of child sex trafficking,
[03:49:13.620 --> 03:49:17.620]  particularly at the southern border, the formerly known southern border, hundreds of thousands
[03:49:17.620 --> 03:49:23.140]  of children that get sex trafficked alone just through the formerly known southern border,
[03:49:23.380 --> 03:49:27.020]  criminal cartels, the pedophile rings, they all come, these kids from the third world.
[03:49:27.020 --> 03:49:29.180]  This happens locally as well.
[03:49:29.180 --> 03:49:31.500]  But then you see this report.
[03:49:31.500 --> 03:49:33.740]  It wasn't only documented by InfoWars.
[03:49:33.740 --> 03:49:35.060]  This was all over the place.
[03:49:35.060 --> 03:49:39.260]  DOJ erases child sex trafficking information from its website.
[03:49:39.260 --> 03:49:44.580]  They remove specific excerpts that had to do with the formerly known southern border and
[03:49:44.580 --> 03:49:51.420]  some critical details about how this is done financially, how this is done not only across
[03:49:51.500 --> 03:49:55.980]  the entire globe, but in the United States of America globally, how they operate with
[03:49:55.980 --> 03:50:00.300]  pimps, how they operate via money, how there are payments and financial transactions that
[03:50:00.300 --> 03:50:01.300]  are made.
[03:50:01.300 --> 03:50:05.900]  And it's not just people and society that you and I would call normal.
[03:50:05.900 --> 03:50:12.020]  This goes like they removed a bunch of intel and you got to ask yourself, apparently this
[03:50:12.020 --> 03:50:13.020]  was done.
[03:50:13.020 --> 03:50:14.780]  They tried to do it quietly, I think, a couple of months ago.
[03:50:14.780 --> 03:50:17.460]  I think it was May is when they actually did it.
[03:50:17.460 --> 03:50:19.500]  I think it's I think it was.
[03:50:19.500 --> 03:50:22.060]  Someone might have to fact check that on me.
[03:50:22.060 --> 03:50:27.300]  But this was quietly done just a couple of months before pedophile month, just a couple
[03:50:27.300 --> 03:50:30.620]  of months before Sound of Freedom comes out.
[03:50:30.620 --> 03:50:32.420]  You want to know why they do this?
[03:50:32.420 --> 03:50:34.060]  Because this is the sinister part.
[03:50:34.060 --> 03:50:35.620]  This is the sinister part.
[03:50:35.620 --> 03:50:39.340]  Like I said, sequence, sequence, sequence.
[03:50:39.340 --> 03:50:46.040]  It's interesting that this takes place preemptively before groomer month, pedophile month.
[03:50:46.040 --> 03:50:47.040]  And this takes place.
[03:50:47.040 --> 03:50:48.040]  All right.
[03:50:48.040 --> 03:50:53.200]  Just happens to take place before Sound of Freedom finally drops on July 4th.
[03:50:53.200 --> 03:50:58.760]  And then don't you find it interesting that the occult media is all calling it QAnon adjacent
[03:50:58.760 --> 03:51:00.880]  conspiratorial?
[03:51:00.880 --> 03:51:02.480]  None of this is real.
[03:51:02.480 --> 03:51:04.800]  It's bogus statistics.
[03:51:04.800 --> 03:51:08.400]  Isn't it interesting that Mike Rothschild said that on CNN?
[03:51:08.400 --> 03:51:10.400]  Bogus statistics.
[03:51:11.000 --> 03:51:16.160]  Oh, and take a look at the DOJ removing what?
[03:51:16.160 --> 03:51:21.280]  Some legitimate statistics that the federal government has put out so that the public
[03:51:21.280 --> 03:51:22.280]  can be aware.
[03:51:22.280 --> 03:51:24.560]  Listen, this is what's interesting about this.
[03:51:24.560 --> 03:51:27.280]  Why would they do that?
[03:51:27.280 --> 03:51:29.520]  I would say two reasons.
[03:51:29.520 --> 03:51:35.840]  Number one, they know it's real and they don't want to be seen affiliated with QAnon adjacent
[03:51:35.840 --> 03:51:37.520]  conspiracies.
[03:51:37.520 --> 03:51:39.360]  That's surface level, I would say.
[03:51:39.360 --> 03:51:40.360]  I'll say there's three reasons.
[03:51:40.360 --> 03:51:43.320]  The first, they don't want to be seen as QAnon adjacent.
[03:51:43.320 --> 03:51:44.320]  Right.
[03:51:44.320 --> 03:51:49.400]  Well, we can't be seen confirming what's in this movie or the federal government.
[03:51:49.400 --> 03:51:54.600]  So when the media comes out and say says it's bogus statistics, oh, OK, well, the DOJ removed
[03:51:54.600 --> 03:51:55.600]  some of that stuff.
[03:51:55.600 --> 03:51:56.600]  So, yeah.
[03:51:56.600 --> 03:51:57.600]  OK.
[03:51:57.600 --> 03:51:58.600]  Big Brother says it.
[03:51:58.600 --> 03:51:59.600]  I believe it, too.
[03:51:59.600 --> 03:52:00.600]  The mainstream media says it.
[03:52:00.600 --> 03:52:03.000]  Oh, I believe it, too.
[03:52:03.000 --> 03:52:05.840]  That's surface level at surface level.
[03:52:05.840 --> 03:52:10.200]  And I would say the next reason is this is the sinister part is that they are 100 percent
[03:52:11.040 --> 03:52:14.320]  fully aware that all this stuff is fully real and it's fully operational.
[03:52:14.320 --> 03:52:18.880]  That's the second reason they are fully aware that there are hundreds of thousands of children
[03:52:18.880 --> 03:52:23.160]  in this country alone, the United States of America being abducted.
[03:52:23.160 --> 03:52:24.680]  They are disappearing.
[03:52:24.680 --> 03:52:28.960]  They're ending up in pedophile rings and they're ending up being sex trafficked to never be
[03:52:28.960 --> 03:52:30.560]  seen ever again.
[03:52:30.560 --> 03:52:31.680]  They're pimped out.
[03:52:31.680 --> 03:52:32.880]  They're prostituted.
[03:52:32.880 --> 03:52:34.280]  They're sexually abused.
[03:52:34.280 --> 03:52:36.080]  They're psychologically abused.
[03:52:36.080 --> 03:52:40.880]  They live a life of absolute hopelessness and a lot of them commit suicide, never to
[03:52:40.880 --> 03:52:43.760]  be heard of ever again.
[03:52:43.760 --> 03:52:48.220]  The Biden DOJ and the deep state, they know this stuff.
[03:52:48.220 --> 03:52:50.880]  They know that it's real.
[03:52:50.880 --> 03:52:53.520]  They know that it's in existence.
[03:52:53.520 --> 03:52:55.520]  That's the second sinister part.
[03:52:55.520 --> 03:52:56.520]  And it gets deeper.
[03:52:56.520 --> 03:52:57.520]  It gets deeper.
[03:52:57.520 --> 03:53:02.120]  The further down you go down this rabbit hole, you find the truth.
[03:53:02.120 --> 03:53:05.360]  And it's it's horrible and it's evil.
[03:53:05.360 --> 03:53:08.520]  The third reason is that they are a part of it.
[03:53:08.520 --> 03:53:13.480]  The third reason is that our own government knows that this stuff is operational.
[03:53:13.480 --> 03:53:16.560]  They run cover for the pedophile politicians.
[03:53:16.560 --> 03:53:19.800]  They run cover for the Jeffrey Epstein's for decades.
[03:53:19.800 --> 03:53:23.600]  And then whoever's on that little black book, whoever's on the Epstein flight logs, they
[03:53:23.600 --> 03:53:26.760]  all get protected because the fall man fell.
[03:53:26.760 --> 03:53:27.760]  So that's it.
[03:53:27.760 --> 03:53:28.760]  Make a Netflix documentary.
[03:53:28.760 --> 03:53:31.920]  Give them a watered down version of it that we want them to know.
[03:53:32.040 --> 03:53:36.240]  Psyop, Psyop, Psyop, Psyop, protect the elites, protect the pedophiles.
[03:53:36.240 --> 03:53:37.760]  That is how deep this goes.
[03:53:37.800 --> 03:53:44.400]  That's the sequence, they run cover for everything.
[03:53:44.400 --> 03:53:49.320]  They not only want to appear like we're not QAnon adjacent, they not only know that this
[03:53:49.320 --> 03:53:53.359]  stuff is a reality, but they partake.
[03:53:53.359 --> 03:53:56.679]  Who do you think has the money to do this?
[03:53:56.679 --> 03:54:02.759]  Who do you think has tens of thousands of dollars to go purchase a child to molest?
[03:54:02.759 --> 03:54:06.320]  The BBC has done stories on this in 2011.
[03:54:06.320 --> 03:54:12.599]  Children from Africa disappearing, undercover reporters interacting with child sex traffickers
[03:54:12.599 --> 03:54:15.480]  and all of the kids, hundreds of thousands of kids.
[03:54:15.480 --> 03:54:17.759]  They all come out and say the same thing.
[03:54:17.759 --> 03:54:19.259]  They're cutting us.
[03:54:19.259 --> 03:54:20.880]  They're extracting our blood.
[03:54:20.880 --> 03:54:25.599]  They're not only raping us, but these little African kids know exactly what juju is.
[03:54:25.599 --> 03:54:27.279]  They know exactly what voodoo is.
[03:54:27.279 --> 03:54:30.160]  They know exactly what these witch doctors do and why they do it.
[03:54:30.160 --> 03:54:34.119]  And all these eyewitness, all these little kids from Africa that are survivors come
[03:54:34.119 --> 03:54:36.599]  out and they say the same thing.
[03:54:36.599 --> 03:54:39.679]  They are performing witchcraft rituals on us.
[03:54:39.679 --> 03:54:40.920]  They're cutting our bodies.
[03:54:40.920 --> 03:54:42.140]  They're cutting our wrists.
[03:54:42.140 --> 03:54:43.580]  They're extracting our blood.
[03:54:43.580 --> 03:54:48.119]  And that's a part of us being sex trafficked because that is just, this was in 2011, the
[03:54:48.119 --> 03:54:49.279]  BBC reported on this.
[03:54:49.279 --> 03:54:50.640]  I'm shocked that they did that.
[03:54:51.700 --> 03:54:55.700]  The rise of Juju, the rise of witchcraft in the UK.
[03:54:55.700 --> 03:54:57.700]  Anyone can go find this article, it's out there.
[03:54:57.700 --> 03:55:00.700]  I'm sure that the team can find it in five seconds.
[03:55:00.700 --> 03:55:03.700]  This is real! Hundreds of thousands of children,
[03:55:03.700 --> 03:55:06.700]  sex traffic for the purposes of witchcraft.
[03:55:06.700 --> 03:55:09.700]  For the purposes of witchcraft!
[03:55:09.700 --> 03:55:11.700]  Interfacing with demonic powers,
[03:55:11.700 --> 03:55:14.700]  and it's seen as some kind of religious experience,
[03:55:14.700 --> 03:55:16.700]  and the elites are all involved in it.
[03:55:16.700 --> 03:55:18.700]  The elites are all involved in it.
[03:55:18.700 --> 03:55:20.700]  And you know what?
[03:55:20.700 --> 03:55:22.700]  I'll end with this.
[03:55:22.700 --> 03:55:24.700]  Do you guys see what happened in California?
[03:55:24.700 --> 03:55:26.700]  Let's get this up, guys.
[03:55:26.700 --> 03:55:29.700]  Failure of child sex trafficking bill in California.
[03:55:29.700 --> 03:55:31.700]  This just happened a couple days ago.
[03:55:31.700 --> 03:55:33.700]  Sequence, guys. Sequence.
[03:55:33.700 --> 03:55:35.700]  Running cover.
[03:55:35.700 --> 03:55:36.700]  Running cover.
[03:55:36.700 --> 03:55:37.700]  Do you think that this...
[03:55:37.700 --> 03:55:39.700]  Listen, failure of child sex trafficking bill
[03:55:39.700 --> 03:55:41.700]  on California Assembly Committee
[03:55:41.700 --> 03:55:43.700]  sparks outrage.
[03:55:43.700 --> 03:55:45.700]  A bill to strengthen penalties
[03:55:45.700 --> 03:55:47.700]  to make a serious felony for repeat offenders
[03:55:47.700 --> 03:55:49.700]  convicted of sexually trafficking children
[03:55:49.700 --> 03:55:51.700]  failed to pass.
[03:55:51.700 --> 03:55:53.700]  Democrats rejected it.
[03:55:53.700 --> 03:55:55.700]  The Assembly Public Safety Committee on July 11th
[03:55:55.700 --> 03:55:57.700]  with only two Republican members
[03:55:57.700 --> 03:56:00.700]  voting in favor for the measure.
[03:56:01.700 --> 03:56:03.700]  You guys, who do you think that's for?
[03:56:03.700 --> 03:56:06.700]  You think that's for your everyday pimp?
[03:56:06.700 --> 03:56:10.700]  You think that's for your gangster child sex trafficker?
[03:56:10.700 --> 03:56:12.700]  Who do you think that's for?
[03:56:12.700 --> 03:56:13.700]  Huh?
[03:56:13.700 --> 03:56:15.700]  Who do you think that...
[03:56:15.700 --> 03:56:18.700]  Who do you think that shutdown and denial is for?
[03:56:18.700 --> 03:56:20.700]  You think that's for the little guys?
[03:56:20.700 --> 03:56:21.700]  Huh?
[03:56:21.700 --> 03:56:24.700]  You think that's for the little guys that somehow, someway
[03:56:24.700 --> 03:56:26.700]  you know, they're watching CP.
[03:56:26.700 --> 03:56:28.700]  They're watching child porn.
[03:56:28.700 --> 03:56:30.700]  You know, you watch To Catch a Predator.
[03:56:30.700 --> 03:56:32.700]  You watch Alex Rosen.
[03:56:32.700 --> 03:56:34.700]  You know, catching pedophiles, which is honorable.
[03:56:34.700 --> 03:56:36.700]  That's 100%. Keep that going, baby.
[03:56:36.700 --> 03:56:38.700]  Keep that going. Catch those people.
[03:56:38.700 --> 03:56:39.700]  CC unit.
[03:56:39.700 --> 03:56:40.700]  A lot of these dudes, man.
[03:56:40.700 --> 03:56:42.700]  They're killing it out there.
[03:56:42.700 --> 03:56:45.700]  You think that's for those dudes that they're catching?
[03:56:45.700 --> 03:56:47.700]  Stuff like this, this kind of legislation
[03:56:47.700 --> 03:56:48.700]  getting struck down?
[03:56:48.700 --> 03:56:50.700]  You think they're trying to run cover for them?
[03:56:50.700 --> 03:56:51.700]  No, man.
[03:56:51.700 --> 03:56:53.700]  That's not even the half of it.
[03:56:53.700 --> 03:56:55.700]  This kind of stuff
[03:56:55.700 --> 03:56:57.700]  is to protect the elites
[03:56:57.700 --> 03:56:59.700]  that are all involved
[03:56:59.700 --> 03:57:01.700]  in these child sex trafficking
[03:57:01.700 --> 03:57:03.700]  pedophile rings.
[03:57:03.700 --> 03:57:05.700]  That's what stuff like that in California,
[03:57:05.700 --> 03:57:07.700]  this is my opinion,
[03:57:07.700 --> 03:57:09.700]  that's what stuff like that in California is about.
[03:57:09.700 --> 03:57:11.700]  They're running cover
[03:57:11.700 --> 03:57:13.700]  for what they know.
[03:57:13.700 --> 03:57:15.700]  They're running cover
[03:57:15.700 --> 03:57:17.700]  for who they know.
[03:57:17.700 --> 03:57:19.700]  Because everybody knows
[03:57:19.700 --> 03:57:21.700]  that this child sex trafficking,
[03:57:21.700 --> 03:57:23.700]  this child sex cult,
[03:57:23.700 --> 03:57:25.700]  is fully operational.
[03:57:25.700 --> 03:57:26.700]  Fully operational.
[03:57:26.700 --> 03:57:28.700]  We need to engage, expose,
[03:57:28.700 --> 03:57:30.700]  expose, shut down,
[03:57:30.700 --> 03:57:32.700]  legally, lawfully, protect the children.
[03:57:32.700 --> 03:57:33.700]  Protect the children.
[03:57:33.700 --> 03:57:35.700]  Do not give them over to the pedophiles.
[03:57:35.700 --> 03:57:36.700]  That is how we lose.
[03:57:36.700 --> 03:57:38.700]  We must protect innocents.
[03:57:38.700 --> 03:57:40.700]  It is of God.
[03:57:40.700 --> 03:57:42.700]  It is part of God to protect the innocents.
[03:57:42.700 --> 03:57:43.700]  Love you guys.
[03:57:43.700 --> 03:57:44.700]  I'll see you guys on the next doom.
[03:57:44.700 --> 03:57:46.700]  War Room starts now.
