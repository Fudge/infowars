[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[00:16.000 --> 00:29.000]  Well they said it would never happen. It was an insane conspiracy theory of Christians in the 1970s and 80s.
[00:29.000 --> 00:42.000]  Why in the future they would microchip us to buy and sell? There'd be a cashless society. We'd merge with machines and worship a one world government.
[00:42.000 --> 00:49.000]  And now to come true.
[00:49.000 --> 00:59.000]  Well the number one enemy of the globalist other than Trump was General Michael Flynn who helped lead the military five years ago to not back al-Qaeda slash al-Nusra ISIS in Syria.
[00:59.000 --> 01:06.000]  When our military finally had their come to Jesus moment Obama tried to purge the military over the next few years but it didn't work.
[01:06.000 --> 01:16.000]  Well the system is very very panicked and they've cooked up this fact that the national security advisor elect shouldn't be talking to a Russian counterpart.
[01:16.000 --> 01:28.000]  And of course they even have the intercepts dropping spot on by Obama and Hillary and Soros using our taxpayer money saying I can't talk to you about sanctions but the president obviously wants to have better relations so we'll get those phone calls set up.
[01:28.000 --> 01:39.000]  He was setting the phone calls up and they said did you talk to the Russians about sanctions? Well technically he didn't negotiate anything but they mentioned they wanted to talk about sanctions so oh it's a lie you gotta go.
[01:39.000 --> 01:46.000]  Very bad sign though because this will create more panic more running scared from the globalist brainwashing machine.
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.000]  Here's a report by Paul Watson though on the hysterics of the so-called liberals.
[01:50.000 --> 02:00.000]  Walking to get coffee saw these all over a sidewalk in the town I'm in. Is this an attempt at swastikas to neo-nazis not have Google?
[02:00.000 --> 02:08.000]  Turns out Sarah Silverman doesn't know how to use Google since one quick search reveals that these are harmless construction markings.
[02:08.000 --> 02:15.000]  No this wasn't a joke. Sarah Silverman actually believes that construction markings are neo-nazis swastikas.
[02:15.000 --> 02:21.000]  The same Sarah Silverman who called on her millions of fans to support a military coup to overthrow Donald Trump.
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.000]  She later corrected her innocent mistake proving again that this wasn't a joke.
[02:25.000 --> 02:34.000]  But wait if these are some thinly veiled pro-Trump neo-nazi message does that mean we need to start punching utility men and construction workers on the street?
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.000]  Look at this guy. Is that a sick hyal? And this guy appears to be erecting a giant T for Trump.
[02:39.000 --> 02:47.000]  This guy is literally Hitler. But seriously this is what happens when rampant virtue signalling meets hysteria.
[02:47.000 --> 02:54.000]  The left is so beset by Trump derangement syndrome they're seeing neo-nazis and swastikas in everything.
[02:54.000 --> 03:02.000]  Just last month someone at university in Ohio mistook a white sheet covering some lab equipment for a Ku Klux Klan robe.
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.000]  Students in Indiana freaked out when they thought this Catholic priest was a KKK member.
[03:07.000 --> 03:15.000]  Neo-nazi hate crimes are being faked across the country. This is collective madness. This is what mass hysteria looks like.
[03:15.000 --> 03:23.000]  Piers Morgan was relentlessly attacked by JK Rowling and other leftists because he refused to accept the premise that Donald Trump was the new Hitler.
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.000]  He was also subjected to a volley of abuse from comedian Jim Jeffries.
[03:27.000 --> 03:34.000]  He let him kill the Jews on the first day. He worked up to it.
[03:34.000 --> 03:44.000]  That is the exact ridiculous hysterical over-the-top nonsense.
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.000]  If people got hysterical in Germany right away then it wouldn't...
[03:48.000 --> 03:51.000]  He's not the new Hitler.
[03:51.000 --> 03:59.000]  Hey Jim, repeatedly shouting f*** off while a biased far-left crowd claps like circus seals isn't an argument.
[03:59.000 --> 04:10.000]  Do you realize how utterly retarded you sound when you compare the architect of one of the worst mass genocides in human history to a former reality TV host?
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  Listen to what actual survivors of Nazi Germany have got to say.
[04:14.000 --> 04:22.000]  Inga Andrews warns that it's the violent far-left mobs who shut down free speech, not Donald Trump that remind her of Hitler.
[04:22.000 --> 04:34.000]  The irony behind all this is that by resorting to such patently ludicrous hyperbole and hysteria, the left is actually helping Donald Trump by becoming the farcical embodiment of delirium,
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.000]  a neurotic derangement in their anti-Trump fervor.
[04:37.000 --> 04:50.000]  Their sidelining and discrediting genuine, legitimate opposition to Trump. So if you're a Trump supporter, the unhinged meltdown we're now seeing on the left cannot go on long enough.
[05:07.000 --> 05:15.000]  Their songwriter dashingly removed her flowing white cloak, only to reveal a Donald Trump Make America Great Again flag turned into a dress.
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.000]  Stunning the crowd, she proudly displayed her courage and beauty to a rush of cameras.
[05:20.000 --> 05:25.000]  Despite backlash from the tolerant left on social media, and who knows what from her peers at the Shammys,
[05:25.000 --> 05:38.000]  she actually showed vast support for Joy as she gained more than 50,000 Twitter followers overnight, was overwhelmed with support, and her album sales jumped over 18,000% to the top of Amazon and number 7 on iTunes.
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.000]  Let this serve as a marketing example and business model for America.
[05:41.000 --> 05:48.000]  Conservative values, anti-PC culture, and real unity and patriotism, this is what is truly popular amongst consumers.
[05:48.000 --> 05:58.000]  As Joy Villa said, you can either stand for what you believe in, or fall for what you don't. No one else but Joy Villa made the Grammys great again. This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.

[07:57.000 --> 08:26.000]  I am a shotgun rider for the San Jacinto Line. The desert is my brother. My skin is cracked and dry. I was riding on a cold coast. And everything was fine, till we took a shorter road to save some time.
[08:26.000 --> 08:39.000]  The bandits only fired once, they shot me in the chest. They may have wounded me, but they'll never get the best of better men.

[08:42.000 --> 08:54.000]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[08:54.000 --> 09:13.000]  It's Tuesday, Valentine's Day, 2017. I'm Alex Jones, your host. Again, thank you so much for joining us. One of my daughters born on Valentine's Day, a little sweetie.
[09:13.000 --> 09:27.000]  We always celebrate our birthdays on the same day because I'm born just a couple of days before her on the old Aquarian calendar. Wow, there's so much to talk about. It's such a big time right now.
[09:27.000 --> 09:43.000]  I woke up at 3.30 a.m. this morning and I knew as I went to the computer, because I went to bed pretty early last night, that it was going to be that Flynn had resigned or been fired.
[09:43.000 --> 09:53.000]  Because I knew that was going to happen two days ago. But I just, what's the fun of being the first to report something like that?
[09:53.000 --> 10:04.000]  Well, the Mitt Romney thing I told you about a month before and two weeks before that he was being played with and toyed with, and I had that directly from about as high as it can go.
[10:04.000 --> 10:09.000]  The Flynn information, I can just read the tea leaves and made a few phone calls.
[10:09.000 --> 10:16.000]  And this is all a great example of how they get everybody running scared. They kept saying during the campaign, has anybody talked to Russians?
[10:16.000 --> 10:21.000]  And they said no. And of course, they were spying on everybody in the Trump campaign and knew that wasn't the case. They hadn't talked to them.
[10:21.000 --> 10:33.000]  But once your president-elect, your designated national security advisor, is supposed to start talking to the Chinese leaders, the Russian leaders, the Israeli leaders, and Flynn talked to all of them.
[10:33.000 --> 10:41.000]  And they asked, did you talk about sanctions with the Russians? He said no.
[10:41.000 --> 10:51.000]  And then they reportedly have the recording and the transcript where the Russian ambassador brings up, well, we want to talk to Trump about sanctions and how that can go and what we can do to get that done.
[10:51.000 --> 10:59.000]  And he said, this has come out now. He said, well, you know the president-elect's policy. He wants an open door and a clean slate.
[10:59.000 --> 11:06.000]  But I can't talk specifics about sanctions. But I'm sure he'll be ready to talk about those when he talks to President Putin.
[11:06.000 --> 11:11.000]  And they went, ladies and gentlemen, we got a firestorm on our hands.
[11:11.000 --> 11:17.000]  Flynn lied. He did talk to the Russians. He talked about sanctions.
[11:17.000 --> 11:30.000]  Now, if somebody calls up an auto parts store and you're the manager, somebody says, I like to talk to you about buying your auto parts place.
[11:30.000 --> 11:37.000]  You say, well, I'm not the owner. He's on vacation. He gets back in a couple of days. But I know he's been talking about wanting to sell it.
[11:37.000 --> 11:41.000]  So Mr. just send us your information and I'm sure he'll be getting back with you.
[11:41.000 --> 11:53.000]  Does that turn into the auto parts store manager was like trying to sell our business with ever having the permission?
[11:53.000 --> 12:04.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Henry Kissinger is the top advisor to Vladimir Putin. One reason I don't particularly trust Putin at some levels.
[12:04.000 --> 12:12.000]  The mega globalist reportedly a Soviet spy during World War II, a double agent code named bore. That's been leaked information.
[12:12.000 --> 12:16.000]  That's why, you know, so many of the secrets.
[12:16.000 --> 12:26.000]  Oh, yeah, the living fossil was a major assistant, kind of like a rinse previous to the O.S.S. with the Rockefellers with David Rockefeller.
[12:26.000 --> 12:33.000]  That's not known. The Rockefellers in the O.S.S. I just released that information, but I've had that on good sources and Intel to back it up.
[12:33.000 --> 12:41.000]  He was certainly a Nazi Germany before the war started taking lots of photos and meeting with lots of top Nazis because his daddy was a heavy investor.
[12:41.000 --> 12:50.000]  The point is that the Rockefellers are on record having major plants inside Russia and inside Germany and made monies off all three sides of the war.
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  There were three sides to it, wasn't two sides.
[12:52.000 --> 12:55.000]  We're two sides at the end, three sides at the beginning. Look it up.
[12:55.000 --> 13:04.000]  Those are like stubborn things like facts being cursed with them being cursed to be informed and then watching people run around go go away USA KKK that's all they know.
[13:04.000 --> 13:11.000]  Well, meanwhile their whole future is being destroyed by the globalist and they're running around going Donald Trump's a Russian agent.
[13:11.000 --> 13:18.000]  What Donald Trump has done and when I've told people a thousand times, which is crazy is it's in mainstream news today admitting what I'm saying is true,
[13:18.000 --> 13:31.000]  that Trump is grabbing globalism away from the multinationals that stole it using U.S. money, power and influence and is actually trying to use globalism to block the communist Chinese reform Europe
[13:31.000 --> 13:40.000]  and have an alliance with Europe, the U.K., Israel, Japan and any other free country wants to have trade and we'll build lots of golf courses and hotels and factories.
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.000]  A pro human president leading America.
[13:44.000 --> 13:52.000]  And they had now admitted Bloomberg and Reuters and Google and news and Yahoo and Politico.
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  It's Trump versus the globalist.
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.000]  Why just two months ago the New York Times said Alex Jones is crazy.
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.000]  He believes in something called the globalist.
[14:03.000 --> 14:10.000]  That was the old propaganda the last 20 years and they got laughed at so hard in three articles they wrote in one week.
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  One of them had me in the headline.
[14:12.000 --> 14:16.000]  What is this globalism? Does it exist that Alex Jones talks about?
[14:16.000 --> 14:26.000]  It's like, what is this Toucan? Does Toucan birds exist?
[14:26.000 --> 14:32.000]  It is globalism, a far-right conspiracy theory buoyed by Trump.
[14:32.000 --> 14:40.000]  And then it goes on to say it's racist and it doesn't exist and Alex Jones is insane.
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.000]  Well that's solid BS gold, isn't it?
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  But notice now it's not that.
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  I have a stack of mainstream news today where they're like, world governments in total crisis.
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  They're going to find out about the derivatives and the scams we've run.
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  We've got to start killing people.
[14:55.000 --> 15:02.000]  Everybody got all their Sarah Silvermans and all their rappers and music people and movie stars saying kill Trump.
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  And they've got major publications calling for his death.
[15:05.000 --> 15:11.000]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, these people have committed so many crimes, the globalist, that if Trump keeps going it's over.
[15:11.000 --> 15:19.000]  You notice Jerry Sandusky's son just got arrested for procuring children for the globalist.
[15:19.000 --> 15:23.000]  And of course Sandusky, I've told you, was a procurer.
[15:23.000 --> 15:28.000]  You take one look at that soulless ringwraith.
[15:28.000 --> 15:34.000]  And you have to understand he got in trouble because he was dipping into his boss's goodie bag.
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.000]  And you can't have Renfield sucking blood himself.
[15:38.000 --> 15:44.000]  You're not a vampire, bro. You're a, you bring us the goodies.
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.000]  I told you there's going to be more arrests in Penn State.
[15:47.000 --> 15:58.000]  I told you that on the Joe Rogan podcast, which is the number one podcast in world history, which they're also trying to block on the charts at Google Play and iTunes or whatever else.
[15:58.000 --> 16:01.000]  Joe's tweeted that out, it's confirmed.
[16:01.000 --> 16:03.000]  Still number one.
[16:03.000 --> 16:05.000]  I know it's only got 45 million views or something now.
[16:05.000 --> 16:07.000]  He would have 200, 300 million.
[16:07.000 --> 16:08.000]  I mean, you saw the algorithm.
[16:08.000 --> 16:09.000]  You just couldn't have that.
[16:09.000 --> 16:15.000]  It couldn't have three or four times the Super Bowl because you probably couldn't ignore that, but ignore 40 million.
[16:15.000 --> 16:17.000]  That'll be easier, of course.
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  But that's on all the different platforms, over 40 million views.
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  And they did block it when it went total viral.
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  They just put a governor on it and stopped it.
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.000]  By the way, Lee and McAddy was pointing this out to me last night.
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.000]  We were doing a live report and I went and looked it up last night to show I don't know much.
[16:36.000 --> 16:39.000]  It's why it's important for people to keep me informed.
[16:39.000 --> 16:43.000]  They'd called a month ago for taking Donald Trump's Twitter away, but that was a little too anti-free speech.
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.000]  That might be too obvious to take the president's Twitter away.
[16:47.000 --> 16:49.000]  Got to discredit him a little bit first.
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.000]  People might actually go, wait, we have something called free speech here.
[16:52.000 --> 17:00.000]  So they now don't let any of the positive comments or good tweets get to him because he tweets back and communicates with people and sees stuff he thinks is interesting.
[17:00.000 --> 17:02.000]  That's a portal he's looking into.
[17:02.000 --> 17:09.000]  So they want to isolate him as much as they can into the White House previous cult.
[17:09.000 --> 17:17.000]  And so they've got it set now where only the negative comments are in the top 100.
[17:17.000 --> 17:20.000]  So they've really suspended Donald Trump.
[17:20.000 --> 17:30.000]  And Donald Trump's up there wondering why suddenly he's getting nothing but negative feedback because they put a filter on there of only people that are attacking him, thinking he's not tech savvy.
[17:30.000 --> 17:35.000]  And then I'd imagine the trusted people come in and say, look, sir, it's getting negative.
[17:35.000 --> 17:39.000]  Sir, give us your cell phone. Don't talk to anyone anymore.
[17:39.000 --> 17:42.000]  In fact, you're not allowed to talk to the Russians. That means you're a Russian spy.
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  Think about how dumb they think we are.
[17:44.000 --> 17:51.000]  Ronald Reagan went and did the deals with Russia and then Congress ratified it.
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.000]  But that's what a president can go sign treaties if he wants.
[17:53.000 --> 17:56.000]  The president is co-equal to Congress and the courts.
[17:56.000 --> 18:00.000]  Hell, the liberals are arguing he's above them all, but not now.
[18:00.000 --> 18:04.000]  But they're on there going, yeah, he's been taught.
[18:04.000 --> 18:06.000]  He talked to Putin a couple of times.
[18:06.000 --> 18:08.000]  He's talking about meeting Putin.
[18:08.000 --> 18:15.000]  And they've so bullied Trump and his administration that they're backing off even in this foreseeable meeting with Putin.
[18:15.000 --> 18:18.000]  Oh my gosh, all the other presidents meet with the Russian president.
[18:18.000 --> 18:23.000]  But see, you can't because, well, you're not the president, sir.
[18:23.000 --> 18:37.000]  Ritz Priebus and Paul Ryan are. And look, just be nice and John McCain and Lindsey Graham will stop trying to overthrow you. Bull, they hate you. They're not men, they're scum.
[18:37.000 --> 18:46.000]  And they don't like you because you've told law enforcement across the country they're green-lighted to go after the pedophile network no matter how far they go.
[18:46.000 --> 18:50.000]  And how hard it is to deal with the country.
[18:50.000 --> 18:55.000]  Yeah, Trump's not using blackmail like the Democrats do with their pedophile rings and the Republicans are involved as well.
[18:55.000 --> 19:01.000]  Trump's burning it all down.
[19:01.000 --> 19:11.000]  So that's what's going on in this country is you got a bunch of scum on top who are into really bad stuff and even get into their club.
[19:11.000 --> 19:13.000]  You've got to do horrible things.
[19:13.000 --> 19:17.000]  And they know their whole party is in trouble.
[19:17.000 --> 19:21.000]  Let's skip this break.
[19:21.000 --> 19:37.000]  They know that their whole shindig is in trouble because they went so far publicly saying they were going to teach pedophilia to kids, sexualizing them, publicly trying to legalize an ambulance,
[19:37.000 --> 19:47.000]  publicly saying mothers and fathers are bad, publicly saying there's 50 and then 100 genders and you can't have a men's bathroom or a woman's bathroom because somebody else might not be a man or a woman just to make you feel bad for existing.
[19:47.000 --> 19:51.000]  Total societal attack.
[19:51.000 --> 19:59.000]  And the intelligence agencies can't help but run across all the weird occultic stuff that the elites are into.
[19:59.000 --> 20:07.000]  This is the gamut, but it's just an entire sewer of different garbage floating through it with the things they're into.
[20:07.000 --> 20:11.000]  But it's all about hurting innocent degrading people, dominating and slaving.
[20:11.000 --> 20:16.000]  That's why they've got, you know, 50 shades of gray than a new one comes out and it's more intense.
[20:16.000 --> 20:23.000]  And now people are getting killed, being part of it, you know, choking to death and the hospitals are having all these emergency calls.
[20:23.000 --> 20:30.000]  And then next it'll be, oh, killing somebody and then next raping a child. See, that's how they, successive approximation.
[20:30.000 --> 20:37.000]  People say, well, it is kind of fun to slap your wife on the butt. You know, they like it. Well, that's not hurting somebody. That's, that's fine.
[20:37.000 --> 20:43.000]  They like it. You like it. That's not actually hurting somebody.
[20:43.000 --> 20:54.000]  But they take something innocent like that and then they extrapolate it out to the UN saying legalize men being able to pick up children up to five years old.
[20:54.000 --> 21:05.000]  If you're five year old or your son or daughter wants to go out with some potbellied pedophile that comes knocking on your door.
[21:05.000 --> 21:14.000]  The UN and some countries like Sweden are actually looking at legalizing and saying, oh, your child can have man boy love.
[21:14.000 --> 21:26.000]  And then salon has articles about what's wrong with fantasizing about a four year old or five year old girl with some again, soft, weird, super ultra beta male kind of gremlin,
[21:26.000 --> 21:40.000]  Renfield type on their licking his lips. I mean, it's, and again, that's, that's a Renfield folks. That's not, you don't, you don't see the Dracula's unless Chucky Summers out in daylight.
[21:40.000 --> 21:52.000]  That, that's, that's, that's one. That's a Renfield and then Schumer and I'm not saying Schumer's involved in anything.
[21:52.000 --> 22:01.000]  I also heard about New York. I'm just saying spiritually. That's my opinion that that has a Renfield spirit and there's a Dracula spirit.
[22:01.000 --> 22:10.000]  But you notice the servants of this always look like that guy. Well, let's pull up Sandesky's son out reportedly been indicted for trying to procure children.
[22:10.000 --> 22:27.000]  Was he procuring him for? Was he trying to get him in the van for? Look at those eyes. That's somebody been tortured hard. That's somebody under mind control.
[22:27.000 --> 22:42.000]  That's a grabber, not a drinker, because let me tell you, they ain't just raping them. Renfield's rape Dracula's killed.
[22:42.000 --> 23:01.000]  Put that in your pipe and smoke it and remember who you're siding with. Just remember because whatever you do, you're going to pay for in this life and the next.
[23:01.000 --> 23:11.000]  So they think they've had a big victory. They have a big celebration right now that they brought down the former head of defense intelligence who reorganized the Pentagon,
[23:11.000 --> 23:20.000]  got the different branches working together, successfully developed plans to stop radical Islamic jihad terror worldwide blocked.
[23:20.000 --> 23:28.000]  They had to watch the Arab Spring turned loose and our military being ordered to resupply and supply Al Qaeda forces out of Saudi Arabia,
[23:28.000 --> 23:42.000]  and watch the name change to ISIS to confuse the public as from everybody from Colonel Shaffer to Rand Paul to Ted Cruz to myself to countless others exposed what was really happening.
[23:42.000 --> 23:48.000]  And so Trump learned about this, admired people involved. There are a lot of other generals involved, but Flynn led the charge.
[23:48.000 --> 23:56.000]  He got fired by Obama for it. Trump brought in Flynn. Flynn thinks he's completely normal, completely good. He wasn't violating the Logan Act.
[23:56.000 --> 24:04.000]  For his own personal gain to discuss foreign deals or policy at a non official governmental meeting.
[24:04.000 --> 24:11.000]  He's on the phone lining up phone calls for the president elect public phone calls he made days later.
[24:11.000 --> 24:23.000]  And they set it all up with a public politically ignorant on average that the National Security Advisor incoming on December 15th had a conversation with the Russian ambassador.
[24:23.000 --> 24:37.000]  You can go back and look, every transition team going back to when they put the red phone in back in the early 60s.
[24:37.000 --> 24:44.000]  Every single transition team talk to their counterparts. In fact, you do that in the weeks before even in office and that totally normal.
[24:44.000 --> 24:54.000]  But see, they set the agendas, they set the rules where if you put mother or father on your first grade, you know, entrance papers when you move, put your kid in school.
[24:54.000 --> 25:01.000]  They go, they call you and they say, we don't have mother and father. You have to use these code abbreviations not to hurt anybody's feeling.
[25:01.000 --> 25:10.000]  You're being inducted into a cult to not say mother, you know, Carol Jones, father, David Jones. No, you just.
[25:10.000 --> 25:18.000]  You just say whatever, whatever that particular school has a code word or an acronym and then there's new ones that you learn the language you're allowed to use.
[25:18.000 --> 25:25.000]  Well, same thing. The media said, you don't talk to the Russians, Trump, you're a Russian agent.
[25:25.000 --> 25:38.000]  Trump's like, I don't think about the Russians, but I know Putin is a nationalist and really pulled out of globalism is doing more for his country than what happened under globalism and I want to use American power through all the power we have to actually empower our country.
[25:38.000 --> 25:49.000]  And they even have foreign affairs and other publications from the Council on Foreign Relations and the Washington Post coming out.
[25:49.000 --> 25:58.000]  I'm going to read some of these articles coming up and admitting, OK, Trump really does want to make America take over globalism and actually make it free market and not have a bunch of war.
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.000]  And just we're not going to let him do that. And the Russians actually are scared of this too.
[26:02.000 --> 26:11.000]  This is going to be so effective and so big that it'll make the U.S. so powerful, what led to Russia. But then they go on and say, but they do hope for their own nationalism.
[26:11.000 --> 26:16.000]  So this puts Putin between a rock and a hard place. So some Russians are actually wanting to get rid of Trump now.
[26:16.000 --> 26:30.000]  And that's really what's going on because the globalists are reaching out to Russia saying, listen, you don't want to be part of this because this is going to end all of the corporate imperialism that all these major power sectors are involved in.
[26:30.000 --> 26:41.000]  The Russians, the Chinese and the United States. The Euro is a fundamentally abusive system meant to destroy sovereignty, meant to destroy cultures and meant to turn people into dead or slaves.
[26:41.000 --> 26:47.000]  That's in their founding documents. It was a corporate takeover by stealth. That's falling apart of its own weight.
[26:47.000 --> 26:56.000]  So they brand everything as a Russian conspiracy because, as I said a thousand times, the Russians began to pull out of globalism 18 years ago, 19 years ago.
[26:56.000 --> 27:00.000]  What's interesting is, it doesn't mean they're perfect, it just means they're trying to become sovereign again.
[27:00.000 --> 27:07.000]  And Trump recognizes that under globalism we are diminished even though our great strength and will built it.
[27:07.000 --> 27:20.000]  They hijacked the Renaissance nation to build the global tyranny. And in the final quarter, Trump is trying to reverse the tables on them.
[27:20.000 --> 27:29.000]  And even if they kill Trump, even if they end up wrecking him down the road, because great positive things are happening, but this is a death battle.
[27:29.000 --> 27:37.000]  In my words and in their words, I'll call it a death battle for years. They call it a death battle with the illiberal West.
[27:37.000 --> 27:44.000]  That's George Soros. That's in the news today. We must stop the illiberal West from messing up our world government.
[27:44.000 --> 27:51.000]  Where it's a bunch of rich billionaires saying, we're going to merge with machines and meet God, merge with it or be destroyed. I mean, that's in the news today.
[27:51.000 --> 28:00.000]  Elon Musk, merge with machines or be obsolete. I mean, it's U.L. assimilate. We are the board. We do not offer any quarter. Submit to us.
[28:00.000 --> 28:09.000]  And it's not like you can merge with a machine. Everybody else is just to be drugged up, phased out, sterilized, bye-bye.
[28:09.000 --> 28:15.000]  So, I mean, we're given a total black flag with a skull and bones on it by the globalist saying, we're never going to surrender.
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.000]  And by the way, we're going to torture you to death.
[28:18.000 --> 28:24.000]  See, a black flag means no surrender. A white flag means surrender. Everybody knows that. What does a skull and crossbones on a flag mean?
[28:24.000 --> 28:35.000]  It was on flags before pirates adopted it on boats. If a military, sort of getting used to some of the crusades, put that on a flag, it meant we're going to kill everybody.
[28:35.000 --> 28:42.000]  If there's blood dripping off the skeleton, it means we're going to torture you too.
[28:42.000 --> 28:48.000]  And skull and bones, the whole globalist deal, is a skull and crossbones. It means, and they worship pirates.
[28:48.000 --> 28:57.000]  We're going to overrun you. We're going to rape you. We're going to kill you. You understand? No quarter.
[28:57.000 --> 29:05.000]  So, our military now knows about this. It's been decompartmentalized, I've exposed it, Drudge has exposed it, Ron Paul has exposed it, countless others have exposed it.
[29:05.000 --> 29:13.000]  People in the military were able to go look this up, find out it was true, decompartmentalize, realize we were being double-crossed by Islamic operations,
[29:13.000 --> 29:19.000]  wasn't just a destabilization in the Middle East, like the military had been told, they were like, all right, fine, have them all kill each other.
[29:19.000 --> 29:24.000]  That was bad enough, see. No, you can't use evil for good and then have it turn out to be good.
[29:24.000 --> 29:28.000]  See, it was really a double-cross to flood us as well and bring us down.
[29:28.000 --> 29:36.000]  The military caught that in mid-sentence, right when they were going to turn us over to Islam in free speech, go out to the Christians, take our guns, all of it,
[29:36.000 --> 29:44.000]  and our military and intelligence agencies said no, but there's now an internal civil war inside the intelligence agencies trying to overthrow Trump,
[29:44.000 --> 29:49.000]  and they're now in open rebellion at the State Department. That's admitted with the media saying, kill Trump.
[29:49.000 --> 29:55.000]  Which the Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[33:21.000 --> 33:38.000]  So here is the bottom line. Everyone around Trump that's a patriot, that supports this republic and that actually wants to give Americans good paying jobs and a future, wants to honor mom and dad and apple pie and baseball and being good,
[33:38.000 --> 33:54.000]  not being demoralized is being targeted and they're either saying you're a KKK member, a white supremacist, like they say about Bannon with just no evidence. They say I'm KKK and they say I'm deeply racist and all of a sudden they're made up crap.
[33:54.000 --> 34:09.000]  I mean they know exactly what they're doing with their constituents to scare other people from being associated with the message. So you keep your mouth shut or you'll get called racist too. But everybody knows that's made up so they've moved on to the Russian spy area.
[34:09.000 --> 34:20.000]  Now they know there's zero connections with Bannon in Russia. But a national security advisor, what do they do? They talk to the other major powers.
[34:20.000 --> 34:29.000]  And so now what's happened? Flynn has stepped down and Michael Moore tweeted. He said now we're going to get Bannon and everybody else. But notice who they don't want.
[34:29.000 --> 34:39.000]  Whenever there's word that previs might be kicked out, it's like, oh no, no, leave previs. He's good Trump. Oh, and we love your son-in-law.
[34:39.000 --> 34:54.000]  We love your son-in-law Jared. He's such a good guy too. He's the guy you should listen to. And I'm not saying Trump's son-in-law is a bad person, but I mean he's New York real estate. He wants to get along with all those folks.
[34:54.000 --> 35:04.000]  He's not hard-nosed like Trump. And I know he helped him a lot in the campaign. And I believe he's loyal to Trump. The point is, you get put under a lot of pressure here.
[35:04.000 --> 35:09.000]  And when Trump went out and gave a press conference yesterday, he went to the Daily Caller and the local radio station.
[35:09.000 --> 35:20.000]  He's delegitimizing the corporate media. This is credited itself as fake news. You watch the Spicer thing. It's ABC News, CNN, CBS, over and over and over again.
[35:20.000 --> 35:28.000]  And then, I mean, maybe once a week some token radio station or something.
[35:28.000 --> 35:37.000]  And again, the briefing rooms aren't where the power is anymore anyways. So that's all a dinosaur itself, but it just shows you Trump's instincts are right.
[35:37.000 --> 35:43.000]  Trump got Trump elected. The American people got him elected. Not Sean Spicer, not Renz Priebus.
[35:43.000 --> 35:50.000]  And I can't help it. A lot of insiders tell me Spicer's not that good. I like his body language. I like a lot of his answers. I just like the guy.
[35:50.000 --> 36:00.000]  Just at a, you know, level. At a physical level. I don't get heebie-jeebies about him. I can do about Renz Priebus.
[36:00.000 --> 36:06.000]  But I get the heebie-jeebies about Renz Priebus. And then I know all about it. He's a Paul Ryan Renfield.
[36:06.000 --> 36:15.000]  And when I say somebody's a Renfield, I don't mean a procurer of children. A Renfield just means a minion of evil.
[36:15.000 --> 36:23.000]  Now I'm saying Sandusky's son just got arrested and indicted for trying to procure kids. And that, that is a Renfield.
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  A literal Renfield. In the child procurement area.
[36:27.000 --> 36:35.000]  But, but not about a Renfield. I just mean, you know, that was Count Dracula's little half vampire and sane minion.
[36:35.000 --> 36:39.000]  And again, all the great literatures is archetypes of real stuff going on in the world.
[36:39.000 --> 36:48.000]  Do they live forever? No, but their evil goes on generation by generation by the abuse they put on children.
[36:48.000 --> 36:54.000]  And they need Renfields around them that'll keep their mouths shut when they're doing the real torture and in butchering.
[36:54.000 --> 37:00.000]  Which always we know is at the top of the pyramid with pedophilia.
[37:00.000 --> 37:11.000]  And I'm not saying Jerry Sandusky and Penn State or Jerry Sandusky's son were involved in that type of Renfielding. We just know it was the raping of little children in broad daylight by Sandusky.
[37:11.000 --> 37:21.000]  And they said, Renfield, you can't do that in public. We do that out at the farmhouses late at night.
[37:21.000 --> 37:26.000]  And then see Renfields produce Renfields.
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.000]  These are guilds. These are classes.
[37:30.000 --> 37:36.000]  I ought to create a deck of cards with vampires versus their minions.
[37:36.000 --> 37:41.000]  Because that's an allegory the public can get and that's what they are.
[37:41.000 --> 37:47.000]  You see, globalism isn't so much a destination as a journey.
[37:47.000 --> 38:03.000]  In a very casual society in full control of the family, they are going to brain damage and euthanize and hurt people so bad that humanity's not going to know what's happening to them until they're finally doing the evil right out in the open in front of everybody.
[38:03.000 --> 38:12.000]  And that's their big goal, to take God's creation and overthrow it and turn it upside down.
[38:12.000 --> 38:25.000]  And as I said yesterday, all Trump is, is humanity coming up under the water in a riptide and trying to get a Gopa air before he gets pulled right back under.
[38:25.000 --> 38:29.000]  Come on in, the water's nice.
[38:29.000 --> 38:32.000]  Says Michael Moore.
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.000]  Says Lord Rothschild.
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  Says Rockefeller.
[38:36.000 --> 38:44.000]  Says George Soros. Take one look at what he looks like and how he acts and what he does and take one look at their little photo shoots and their friends.
[38:44.000 --> 38:49.000]  You look at them, you go, my God, that looks like the cast of a vampire movie.
[38:49.000 --> 38:56.000]  And you know, it's funny what you're looking at. Sometimes your eyes don't lie to you.
[38:56.000 --> 39:04.000]  And how they hate barrel-chested, red-skinned, strong men.
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.000]  Strong, barrel-chested black men or anything else.
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  And I'm not saying people are bad at it.
[39:09.000 --> 39:17.000]  I'm talking about the way the globalists look as a group, as a combine.
[39:17.000 --> 39:22.000]  What they're up to, what they're involved in, what they're doing and how they'll be defeated.
[39:22.000 --> 39:29.000]  You have to recognize them as predators that have been born and trained and are genetically inbred.
[39:29.000 --> 39:34.000]  They don't care what group they are of every cast, every group. They all have the parasite cast.
[39:34.000 --> 39:39.000]  The Moorlox and the Eloy. H.E. Wells wrote a book saying Moorlox and Eloy is the real eugenics.
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.000]  Saga and how he sees the elite versus the people.
[39:42.000 --> 39:47.000]  But the paradox is the Moorlox is underground. It is evil. It does drag you into the pit and feed on you.
[39:47.000 --> 39:52.000]  But it's smarter than you. It has knowledge of science.
[39:52.000 --> 39:58.000]  Why is it smart about control and the Eloy are beautiful and smart, but they don't care about science?
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.000]  They're ruled by the Moorlox.
[40:01.000 --> 40:09.000]  Then we can pull up this 1930s time machine, those of the 60s one as well, and they put up the Moorlox and the Eloy as for TV viewers.
[40:09.000 --> 40:14.000]  The New York Times, the Washington Post probably say Alex Jones believes vampires and Moorlox are real.
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  No, I said they're allegories.
[40:16.000 --> 40:26.000]  But it won't stop Fox News from editing the tape. That's why it's going to be audio so they can deceive their viewers.
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.000]  But make no mistake.
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.000]  What you've seen is the ongoing counter coup.
[40:34.000 --> 40:45.000]  And it's not a good sign because there was a coup. We had a counter coup. It's a counter coup to the counter coup.
[40:45.000 --> 40:55.000]  And it shows that Trump is listening more and more to Paul Ryan and rinse previous at others saying, look, we know there's no Russian ties to you.
[40:55.000 --> 41:00.000]  But if anybody else has ties, prove it to people, get rid of them.
[41:00.000 --> 41:06.000]  And so all the news is saying today this proves it's a Russian operation. This is going to bring Trump down.
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.000]  This proves the investigation is just going to get started now.
[41:10.000 --> 41:16.000]  And John McCain's running around foaming at the mouth and the Republican leaders are on Fox News with their chest out going, yeah.
[41:16.000 --> 41:24.000]  We'll get to the bottom of this. We'll keep Trump on a short leash. We know how to keep you safe from them during Ruskies.
[41:24.000 --> 41:36.000]  Just like we knew it would go. So I know Trump's super smart.
[41:36.000 --> 41:46.000]  So maybe Flynn did some other things because that's really what it is.
[41:46.000 --> 41:54.000]  I shouldn't say maybe Flynn did other things. Flynn's not bad and Flynn's a super patriot and led inside the government the counter coup against the globalist.
[41:54.000 --> 42:00.000]  We're about to in free speech, totally take over just in the name of net neutrality, start total censorship.
[42:00.000 --> 42:06.000]  Again, everything's upside down. Real hardcore evil was about to commence. They admitted that that was their plan when Hillary got in.
[42:06.000 --> 42:17.000]  But it was so obvious over the top that finally people in our government and the citizens and across the world are awakening saying, no, we don't want this.
[42:17.000 --> 42:23.000]  And so Flynn's on the phone 18 hours a day.
[42:23.000 --> 42:36.000]  And they've got so many regulations and so many different things that they could go through all that and they could find a few things Flynn might not have dotted or crossed perfectly like the next to Suza.
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  And then you see that's the big embarrassment.
[42:38.000 --> 42:47.000]  I don't think Flynn's gone because of this made up Russian crap.
[42:47.000 --> 42:54.000]  This paperwork filed in consulting deals previous to the campaign with Turkey.
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.000]  And I'll just put that out there. Nobody else knows about that kind of stuff. Just everybody understands what's really going on.
[42:58.000 --> 43:04.000]  You've got to be 100% absolutely pristine clean, which which he was.
[43:04.000 --> 43:06.000]  But it doesn't matter. They're going to go after everybody.
[43:06.000 --> 43:16.000]  They're going to try to persecute whoever they can to intimidate everybody in that White House if they can't intimidate Trump to toe the line or we're going to personally destroy you and your family.
[43:16.000 --> 43:23.000]  All as an article, the real reason General Flynn was forced to design the military industrial complex is trying to sabotage Trump.
[43:23.000 --> 43:31.000]  And Eisenhower warned us of the complex, not a strong defense, but a complex that wants to dominate America and the rest of the world.
[43:31.000 --> 43:36.000]  And it was basically sabotaging our country because the complex itself is the global government.
[43:36.000 --> 43:40.000]  It is the teeth of the global corporate government and thinks it's so big.
[43:40.000 --> 43:46.000]  It's going to sit here and destroy mom and apple pie in prosperity and go after Christians and go after families.
[43:46.000 --> 43:56.000]  And it's just not going to happen. Military industrial complex run by a bunch of analysts and a bunch of pervert foundations and a bunch of control freak social engineers.
[43:56.000 --> 44:01.000]  So every time we're against the military industrial complex, they go, oh, you're against the military or see these are all definitions or oh, you're against having a strong defense.
[44:01.000 --> 44:07.000]  No, Trump's going to give us an updated strong defense and more than a third of our fighters are going to be operable again.
[44:07.000 --> 44:15.000]  And we're going to have systems that work. At least that's the goal. Nothing's perfect.
[44:15.000 --> 44:18.000]  And Trump's already backed off some of the F-35 and the rest of it.
[44:18.000 --> 44:21.000]  Because Matt has said, well, the rest of the world's already buying it.
[44:21.000 --> 44:26.000]  So we're going to sell the world this thing and we hope it gets to where it works better.
[44:26.000 --> 44:32.000]  What's powerful about it is the platforms, the things that are on the platform.
[44:32.000 --> 44:38.000]  Not the, the plane is like a black budget con game for a bunch of other stuff they've been building.
[44:38.000 --> 44:44.000]  Okay, I'll just let you know everything. And I don't even need to be told all this. I study this constantly.
[44:44.000 --> 44:49.000]  I know how things work. That's what I do. Not bragging, but that's why the military is the world listen.
[44:49.000 --> 45:00.000]  It's why people that are in power listen because this is a real broadcast folks. This isn't dumb down Oscars or Grammys or Emmys and American dad and all that stuff.
[45:00.000 --> 45:07.000]  This is the real world. So Trump's even like, okay, have your F-35. God, the thing cost billions of piece.
[45:07.000 --> 45:14.000]  Well, and they're like, well, it's too big to fail, sir. He's like, for the time being fine, at least we just built it in America.
[45:14.000 --> 45:19.000]  And can we get Boeing back here? Can we get some jobs going?
[45:19.000 --> 45:25.000]  Those are the few things Trump's kind of halfway like signals because in a deal you're supposed to tell Japan,
[45:25.000 --> 45:30.000]  we're going to take everything away from you and Japan runs and goes, we'll give you hundreds of billions of investment and we'll start accepting your products.
[45:30.000 --> 45:37.000]  We promise, please, because they know Trump's strong. Plus they're worried about China. I mean, Trump, you know, the media keep saying,
[45:37.000 --> 45:45.000]  Trump is backing off what he said he'd do to China by half. That's what you do in a negotiation.
[45:45.000 --> 45:51.000]  It's not one sided deals anymore. He comes and says, you're screwing us over. We're going to do the same thing back to you unless you negotiate.
[45:51.000 --> 46:02.000]  And then they start negotiating. That's what a negotiation is a two way street reciprocal.
[46:02.000 --> 46:06.000]  So that's the whole spend machine.
[46:06.000 --> 46:11.000]  I'm going to submit air refueling here for a moment and then start reading into this article.
[46:11.000 --> 46:20.000]  And I really want to have these guests on today, but I'm tempted to push some of them back.
[46:20.000 --> 46:25.000]  I've been trying to get Michael Schneider on for a while, but he was out of town. Can we push Schneider to the third hour?
[46:25.000 --> 46:33.000]  Or maybe 1230 because I need to read these articles because I read these articles myself and then they're so important.
[46:33.000 --> 46:37.000]  And then I never get to him on air. I just kind of mentioned him.
[46:37.000 --> 46:49.000]  And we look at that headline sabotage. Obama is commanding an activist army of 30,000 anti-Trump activists from his home two miles in a bunker from the White House.
[46:49.000 --> 46:53.000]  And then by the way, that's in the New York Post and in the Hill.
[46:53.000 --> 46:58.000]  I mean, this is incredible.
[46:58.000 --> 47:04.000]  We told you this was coming, but the government's like divided into two. There's a civil war going on.
[47:04.000 --> 47:09.000]  And the bureaucracy is the people in a lot of control positions are obviously Obama people.
[47:09.000 --> 47:12.000]  Remember how he put tens of thousands of new people in before he left?
[47:12.000 --> 47:15.000]  And just the last month, just putting moles in everywhere.
[47:15.000 --> 47:22.000]  I mean, this is so seditious. And then they tell us when they're the globalist takeover army, they're the corporate invaders.
[47:22.000 --> 47:25.000]  It'd be like if aliens invaded.
[47:25.000 --> 47:29.000]  And we had a president that got elected to deal with the threat.
[47:29.000 --> 47:35.000]  And the aliens pointed their finger and said, no, the Russians are the threat because Trump was talking to the Russians about fighting the aliens.
[47:35.000 --> 47:40.000]  Because globalism is alien. It's a new form of government. It's global. It's oppressive. It's anti-human. It's satanic.
[47:40.000 --> 47:47.000]  It's directed by, if you believe the Bible, a fallen offworld entity.
[47:47.000 --> 47:52.000]  And they make fun of that on the young Turks and in Huffington Post and the New York Times.
[47:52.000 --> 47:56.000]  Oh, Jones believes an offworld entity is directing humanity to destroy itself.
[47:56.000 --> 48:00.000]  Yeah, that's what every major culture believes. And I'm Christian. The Jews believe that too.
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  And you know what? You look around, that's what's going on.
[48:02.000 --> 48:09.000]  And then he found out the world leaders are praying to it and believe they're getting satanic knowledge on how to fight us.
[48:09.000 --> 48:16.000]  And you know what? You go study the British families in the 1850s that did all this.
[48:16.000 --> 48:32.000]  And they openly believe they're channeling the stuff and then envisioned DNA, envisioned biometrics, envisioned all the major sciences, computers,
[48:32.000 --> 48:35.000]  and then went out and told their scientists start developing it.
[48:35.000 --> 48:39.000]  And then they said, we've got to have the general public hear about this so that the inventors come forward.
[48:39.000 --> 48:46.000]  So they had HG Wells in the 1890s and things start and others start writing this,
[48:46.000 --> 48:50.000]  knowing that the elites couldn't come up with it, but they'd been given the knowledge.
[48:50.000 --> 48:55.000]  So they believe that they put out basically the basic template in predictive programming that then,
[48:55.000 --> 48:58.000]  because we're made in the image of God, we're master builders,
[48:58.000 --> 49:02.000]  that there would be humans that would then build it because they heard about it.
[49:02.000 --> 49:08.000]  I mean, it sounds like a science fiction movie. That's what you're living, folks.
[49:08.000 --> 49:14.000]  So they've got you obsessed with UFOs and, you know, crashed rockets and weather balloons and all this.
[49:14.000 --> 49:18.000]  That's not where this stuff came from. It came from the other dimensions.
[49:18.000 --> 49:23.000]  It's like that goofy movie, Pacific Rim, we thought the aliens would come from outer space.
[49:23.000 --> 49:31.000]  They came from a rift in the time space continuum, a blast gate in the deep, deep ocean.
[49:31.000 --> 49:39.000]  That's basically what it is, but it's not 500-yard-tall dinosaurs.
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  And then you can say, well, that's just insanity.
[49:41.000 --> 49:46.000]  But I talked to top psychiatrists, psychologists, genetic engineers, all of them believe in God now.
[49:46.000 --> 49:51.000]  All of them know it's a demonic interstellar, intergalactic, interdimensional deal.
[49:51.000 --> 49:55.000]  I mean, just that that's what Christians all believe. There's a fallen devil.
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  It wants to overthrow creation, do horrible things.
[49:57.000 --> 50:02.000]  In the days of men, when all this was happening, there were giants and the seed wasn't clean
[50:02.000 --> 50:09.000]  because they genetically manipulated God's design.
[50:09.000 --> 50:13.000]  And so God had to wipe off all the life on Earth and start over.
[50:13.000 --> 50:17.000]  And then we dig up all this fantastical stuff.
[50:17.000 --> 50:23.000]  And they tell us, oh, that's billions of years old.
[50:23.000 --> 50:27.000]  Folks, we're living in the middle of a fantastic forbidden planet.
[50:27.000 --> 50:31.000]  And I'm telling you, the elite, they know the secrets. I don't know them all.
[50:31.000 --> 50:36.000]  I've just reverse engineered it, studied it and read their writings and watched what they're doing.
[50:36.000 --> 50:41.000]  But either this is all true and they're completely insane or they're just completely insane.
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.000]  I'm not saying I believe any of it.
[50:44.000 --> 50:50.000]  But I know this, they want to turn over Western society to a bunch of radical Islamic men
[50:50.000 --> 50:53.000]  because they hate Christianity and they hate women.
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  That's why they tell you all day how much they love women.
[50:55.000 --> 51:21.000]  This is the story of the shaving company called Harry's in an epic battle of David versus Goliath.
[51:21.000 --> 51:25.000]  They hired the best designers, they bought a 95 year old German blade factory
[51:25.000 --> 51:30.000]  and they started selling high quality razors online with no upcharging direct to customers.
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  How did the overpriced razor company respond?
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  By threatening to sue their pants off.
[51:34.000 --> 51:40.000]  Don't worry, Chef and Andy have plenty of pants and a relentless dream to give all guys a great shave at a great price.
[51:40.000 --> 51:42.000]  Try Harry's free.
[51:42.000 --> 51:48.000]  They'll send you a razor with five German blades, foaming shave gel and even a travel blade cover when you sign up.

[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  I won't even turn my head.
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  I won't even turn my head.
[54:19.000 --> 54:22.000]  Don't send your Ken folks around to give me no talking to.
[54:22.000 --> 54:25.000]  Don't send your Ken folks to give me no talking to.
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  I'll be gone, like I said.
[54:27.000 --> 54:29.000]  I'll be gone, like I said.
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  I enjoy this song more and more as I get older.
[54:31.000 --> 54:36.000]  You would say the same old thing that you've been saying all along.
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.000]  Lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut till I'm gone.
[54:41.000 --> 54:44.000]  Don't give me that old familiar.
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.000]  Think you've been there before?
[54:46.000 --> 54:51.000]  I love women so much.
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  They could be funny sometimes, Ken.
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  Alright, let's get serious.
[55:04.000 --> 55:15.000]  That old Johnny Cash.
[55:15.000 --> 55:19.000]  Okay, coming up, I'm going to focus to be a good boy.
[55:19.000 --> 55:26.000]  And I'm going to go ahead and read these articles where they admit in major globalist publications exactly what's going on.
[55:26.000 --> 55:30.000]  And when they reach that level, you know it's a danger zone.
[55:30.000 --> 55:35.000]  Because they're not communicating with the USA, KKK, go away zombies.
[55:35.000 --> 55:40.000]  They just go ahead and go, okay, okay, Trump wants to actually have a revolution and make America run the global government.
[55:40.000 --> 55:44.000]  And Russia, you better watch out because, you know, you're hearing he wants to work with Russia.
[55:44.000 --> 55:47.000]  Well, that means that the United States is actually going to run everything so you better watch out.
[55:47.000 --> 55:51.000]  He's kicking us out of here and you should just join with us because...
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  And so they're just totally panicking.
[55:53.000 --> 55:59.000]  But they're admitting the real Trump plan with soft power and being the good guys again
[55:59.000 --> 56:04.000]  and actually doing business deals with people and giving them a chance to work with us.
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  Now they want to have a military confrontation.
[56:06.000 --> 56:12.000]  They're going to come up against a real military that can absolutely defeat them.
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  So I'm going to get to all that.
[56:14.000 --> 56:18.000]  Report, North Korea assassinates Kim Jong-un's half-brother in Malaysia.
[56:18.000 --> 56:19.000]  That's been confirmed.
[56:19.000 --> 56:22.000]  Kim Jong-nam, poor guy.
[56:22.000 --> 56:31.000]  There are some stories that are absolute rosetta stones, as I say, decoder keys to everything.
[56:31.000 --> 56:36.000]  And he was in such a prison of tyranny, even though he was going to be the leader.
[56:36.000 --> 56:44.000]  It was such a hellhole that he got caught with a fake passport in Tokyo trying to go to Disney World.
[56:44.000 --> 56:50.000]  He did want to execute people and torture people and that's why his dad basically disowned him.
[56:50.000 --> 56:56.000]  And then he did find the little demon in Kim Jong-un and now Kim Jong-un has had him killed.
[56:56.000 --> 57:01.000]  Imagine the status top of the one of total state and then it's twisted as Disney World is still.
[57:01.000 --> 57:05.000]  Imagine how magic that is to somebody that's grown up in North Korea.
[57:05.000 --> 57:11.000]  And all he wanted to do as an adult was go to Disney World.
[57:11.000 --> 57:12.000]  All right, listen, I barely plug.
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  So when we plug, we need your support.
[57:14.000 --> 57:17.000]  The new toothpaste is here, sold out last time.
[57:17.000 --> 57:22.000]  It's super blue with a colloidal silver and iodine plus tea tree and more.
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  It's got the peppermint and it's just amazing.
[57:24.000 --> 57:25.000]  It's concentrated.
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  It supports the broadcast.
[57:27.000 --> 57:33.000]  And this is the type of item that I literally got this a few months ago, used it, was out, dug around in my drawer,
[57:33.000 --> 57:39.000]  found an old, you know, organic brand and thought, why don't I just have this set up because I forget to bring stuff home.
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  And I said, you need to plug auto-ship.
[57:41.000 --> 57:46.000]  Everybody needs to go sign up for auto-ship every 30 days, every 60, every 90, whatever, you get 10% off when you do it.
[57:46.000 --> 57:50.000]  And then for store.com for super blue, then you're getting great toothpaste.
[57:50.000 --> 57:55.000]  You're getting the best quality and you're supporting the transmission that's fighting so hard against the globalist.
[57:55.000 --> 58:00.000]  Because again, we're the talking points to the good people in the government and other governments to understand what's really going on.
[58:00.000 --> 58:03.000]  I don't say that arrogantly, but we really know what we're talking about.
[58:03.000 --> 58:04.000]  Our guests know what we're talking about.
[58:04.000 --> 58:05.000]  We're cutting edge.
[58:05.000 --> 58:08.000]  That's why you hear stuff here years or months before it's in the news.
[58:08.000 --> 58:12.000]  So super blue is really just an amazing product.
[58:12.000 --> 58:16.000]  My dad's a dentist, retired, developed it.
[58:16.000 --> 58:21.000]  Again, it's the number one selling national brand out there of organic toothpaste, probably labeled by us at their factory,
[58:21.000 --> 58:24.000]  but then added the clodal silver and other goodies to it.
[58:24.000 --> 58:27.000]  So it's a true game changer, one-of-a-kind, a proprietary product.
[58:27.000 --> 58:31.000]  Infowarsstore.com, InfowarsLive.com or 888-2533-139.
[58:31.000 --> 58:34.000]  Shipping is free on all orders, $50 or more.
[58:34.000 --> 58:46.000]  We'll be back with our number two. Stay with us.
[59:04.000 --> 59:06.000]  To see if they could find something.
[59:34.000 --> 59:37.000]  The man who is second in the betrayal of national security,
[59:37.000 --> 59:40.000]  only to the presidential candidate that he supported, Hillary Clinton.
[59:40.000 --> 59:44.000]  And immediately, Democrats call for more of Trump's cabinet appointments to be investigated.
[59:44.000 --> 59:46.000]  You can't appease Stalinists.
[59:46.000 --> 1:00:11.000]  ForeverWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  If you just heard that one minute hot topic thing that I air on my internet streams,
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  because I've gotten rid of most of the ads on our streams,
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  you heard David Knight on fire in 60 seconds, devastatingly laying out what happened to Flynn.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  Can we grab that and play that to start the next segment for the full AM and FM audience to hear?
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  That is powerful.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  That one minute, it's one of the really technical, tedious, complex stuff that knights the best.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  And I don't mean that in a bad way. I don't mean this condescending.
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  But for the general talk radio audience that's more informed than the general public,
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  still a lot of the stuff Knight covers sometimes I'm sitting there having to like strain to understand what he's saying.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  And I spend my life studying this stuff.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  So I think Knight's only problem is he's too smart for most of us.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  But if he's here, I just want him on because the way he just crystallized that all down for everybody.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  He'll be on. Okay, good. It's just it makes me so angry.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  The traitorous head of the Justice Department that wouldn't implement the law that Trump put in that was clearly the law.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  And then the court that's rebelling, she said, oh, Flynn could be blackmailed.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  These are the people that were recording Flynn going over everything he said trying to find something.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  And they said, you lied to Pence saying you didn't talk about sanctions.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  And the Washington Post admits, oh, we've got the transcript.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  Well, then give it to us.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  Where the Russians say we want to talk about sanctions.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  We talk about that with Trump at the first meeting.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  And obviously they didn't talk about it the first meeting, which meant Flynn, the word I got is said, that's probably not a good idea.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  Well, aren't we going to have good relations?
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  Well, you've heard the president.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  I mean, that's the job of the incoming National Security Director to talk to world leaders.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  That's what they do all day long.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  But they go, oh, my gosh, firestorm.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  Remember during the campaign, they kept saying he was talking to the Russians, which they weren't.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  But then once he was president, they'd already set the table that the president and his National Security Advisors were going to talk to anybody.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  The Justice Department says so.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  And of the Justice Department of Obama, see, it's the Justice Department of Obama back in time is now back to the future.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  And Obama's moved into an armored compound with a bunker and machine gun nest two miles away.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  And they're just announcing the total overthrow and have every major news channel that I see.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  And Holly Woods, Sarah Silverman, everybody, saying kill Trump overthrow coup d'etat.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  You've got a drudgereport.com. He's linked to our article where the Russians biggest fear is quoted in foreign affairs.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  Other publications is that they're going to kill Trump.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  And then I saw media already saying how ridiculous.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  Look at the fake news. The Russians are worried as if anyone would kill Trump.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  It's like no one wants to get rid of your cash, Alex.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  Crazy people like Alex Jones.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  There's a plan to get rid of cash to then control populations.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  And now it's all happening because it was in white papers 20 years ago.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  By the way, where do you think we got the warnings about all this from?
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  Who do you think was in the John Birch Society?
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  There was almost all FBI and CIA people that were freaked out on what they were told.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  They were brought into the above PhD level courses.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  Like the professor we had on last week, a special Rockefeller secret PhD from the Rockefeller Foundation.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  They admit he has it.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  I've talked to many people that have gotten those.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  Man, it is total. We're going to brainwash the public.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  We're going to end the family.
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  We're going to make humans made in labs. We're going to be God.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  They have been spewing this BS since 1856.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  When Galton, Wedgwood, Huxley, and others had their meetings, look it up.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  They wrote books. It's so crazy, man.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  We will discover the secrets of the universe.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  And through these secrets, we will be able to destroy entire cities with weapons.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  And we will find the double snakes of the code of the human.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  And it is, it's a double snake.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  The ancient New DNA was double.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  Folks, I'm telling you, they got heavy knowledge, okay?
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  But they used it to hurt people.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  And it's wrong.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  And it needs to stop.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  And we need all these secrets of the universe to empower humanity,
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  not to empower a bunch of horrible, greedy creatures that only want it for themselves.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  But they want to make us like them.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  That's why the public is becoming so greedy, so envious.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  Because we get all this technology and all this freedom.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  And even though they poison it with their trojan horses,
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  still it makes us decadent, just like the devil was in heaven.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  We're going to break it all down.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  Powerful transmission straight ahead.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  Who made a commitment to wear a white puzzle piece pin every day for a year
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  to force herself to think about her white privilege
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  and the impact white privilege has on people of color.
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  Well, as a person of color, I ask you to instead consider this.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  What is the impact of continuously fomenting racial division
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  by focusing on superficial differences?
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  This article is by The College Fix.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  It's linked on DrudgeReport.com.
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  Stay tuned for more special reports.

[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  That's infowarsteam.com.
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  And vitamin mineral fusion.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  We'll catch you now before we sell out.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  Well, the Democrats and the Congressional Caucus are on C-SPAN right now,
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  having a press conference about Russians hacking the election
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  and that they have all this proof which they don't have,
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  and the fact that Flynn has resigned just shows that the Ruskies took America over.
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  So see, Mr. President, whoever advised you to just go ahead and give the neocons
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  a sacrificial lamb and get rid of somebody that actually had really good policy ideas
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  to not open our borders to Islam, radical Islam.
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  You're going to notice now that that put blood in the water for the sharks.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  And I know President Trump's smart, but that's a fact.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  But you see, they have publications where the establishment is actually very, very,
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  very, very honest about what they're doing and what they stand for.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  And Paul Watson has written about this today at infowarsteam.com.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  I got up at 3.30 in the morning.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  I was already reading this article out of just tens of thousands that are out there.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  And hours later saw that Paul had written about it.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  That's how synced we get.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  Russian insiders fear Washington establishment will assassinate Trump.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  It's one of the top links on Drudge. It's our article.
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  Of course, media calls us fake news.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  All we do is link to the Council on Foreign Relations Connected Foreign Policy Report
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  put out by the Washington Post.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  And I say that because it's like a copy journal.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  I mean, they admit they overlap with foreign affairs, the bimonthly little book that comes out on newsstands
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  that's put up by the Council on Foreign Relations.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  Talk about infiltrated.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  That was set up by British intelligence publicly, OSS in 1922 in New York,
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  to openly, through the Atlantic society, merge the United States and England.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  That's why the first big Hollywood movies, everybody talks with the British accent,
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  even if they weren't British.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  That was, I mean, they were trying to make us Anglophiles and suddenly the Queen was in newspapers
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  and on the radio and the cool thing to do was drink out of teacups and have the Queen on it.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  You ever wondered how America, like, was against royalty and all this suddenly worshipped
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  and it was the rollout of silent movies and then movies and musicals and newspapers
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  and British intelligence bankrolled Hollywood.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  There's books written on that. That's not a secret.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  That's what made us worship the British government again.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  I just love how we're infiltrated by Russians.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  I mean, the Russians will fight you in brute force at a war and it'll fight hard,
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  but nobody's more weasley than British intelligence and we're up to our eyeballs and all that right now.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  Luckily, there's some better people getting in in the U.K.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  and so they're trying to bring in nationalism and prosperity and not total surrender to Islam.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  The same thing's happening in Europe.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  Sanity's coming back.
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  And of course, it's been in the London Independent.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  It's been even in the BBC that's tried to cover it up before that major pedophile rings, quote,
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  run the U.K. and that it's a national security crisis.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  That's a headline.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  And then what do we have at the Vatican?
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  How was the Vatican brought down and taken over by the globalists completely?
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  The black pope, the Jesuit general, is now in control.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  And now the Vatican's openly anti-Christian.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  I mean, it's literally a pentagram. It's upside down.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  It's an upside down cross.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  Pope Francis is an upside down cross.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  That's what he embodies.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  He's an absolute on fire demon.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  You can just look at him, not much less what he does.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  Most satanic creature I've ever seen.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  Talk about Dracula, he's it.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  And they overthrew what was left of the Catholic Church with their pedophile rings.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  You notice now the entire Catholic war that's going on and the entire Catholic world
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  is actually battling right now, Pope Francis, because he's such an abomination
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  when he says stuff in official Catholic papers like,
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  it disgusts me to see Europe saying it's Christian.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  And as Christian roots, it disgusts you.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  Notice that Athens just allowed the first mosque in hundreds of years.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  You know why?
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  Greeks used to be blonde-haired and blue-eyed folks.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  So did Romans.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  Do you know why Greeks now have black hair?
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  And you know why they have Muslim features or Islamic features or Arabic features, I should say?
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  You know why?
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  I could go further about anatomy.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  Greek statues, Greek paintings look nothing like Greeks today.
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  Unless you see somebody that somehow kept their Greek lineage, it looks like Milo,
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  a tall guy with blonde hair and blue eyes.
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  Because the Muslims came in and put hundreds of thousands of the sword
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  and forcibly raped basically everybody, and the only Greeks who survived
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  hid in the mountains for hundreds of years and finally repelled them.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  But now come on in, baby.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  Some Greek islands now, there's hundreds of them,
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  have over 300,000 Muslims on them alone.
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  Greek, Greece is gone again.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  And they just ran the white flag up to build a big fat juicy mosque.
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  And then we're just told that we should just totally, and here's the deal.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  If it was a bunch of brown-skinned people coming in that wanted to be Greek,
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  I don't care what color they are.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  The point is Greeks aren't Greeks because they got overrun by the Muslims
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  just like Constantinople used to be its name.
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  It's now called Istanbul, and the big beautiful blue mosque,
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  the marvel of Islamic architecture was built by Christians.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  And it was the Holy Roman Empire until it was sacked by the Muslims
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  when Rome finally fell completely.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  Not Rome-Rome that fell to Alaric in 410, the Visigoth Chieftain, but the other Rome.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  But see, again, I am cursed with history, cursed with knowledge, cursed with the facts.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  I can't just feel like Sarah Silverman and see what everybody knows is power pole markings on the ground
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  where they explain where the cables are, what type they are.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  They've got little handbooks, it's universal.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  Whether a line's live, whether it's not, how far apart they are, they go market.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  What do the engineers do for people that are going to go dig it up?
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  And if they mess up, it turns the power off in the neighborhood or bust a water main, you know that stuff?
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  No, it's a swastika sea, because she knows how to see swastikas.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  It's called being a basket case artificial schizophrenic.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  It's crazy.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  People from California that moved to Texas, they think country music itself is racist.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  I've had them tell me, oh my God, you shouldn't have a big Ford pickup truck.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  And oh my gosh, I can't believe how many of them there are around here.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  After a woman walked in front of my car in a parking lot, I stopped and waved her by and she turned and said, F you to me.
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  And I rolled up and went, I said, what's your problem?
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  I said, oh, look at you with your big old truck and you're Mr. Tough Guy.
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  And I went, man, what are you talking about?
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  And then there was a couple guys lined up.
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  There was a hamburger place right there.
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  And they were walking up the window and they were like, yeah, it's kind of hard to deal with these people.
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  But you get used to these Texans.
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  And I just looked at all these shrunken sacks of dehumanized garbage all into how they were weak and ugly.
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  All races and colors just all look like they had their souls sucked out of them.
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  They were literally just like, look at your big truck.
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  But they really meant was look at your big neck.
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  Look at your eyes.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:40.000]  They had fire in them.
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  Oh, look at you.
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  Look at you.
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  You just swam two miles Barton Springs.
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  You're all, you're all, you're alive.
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  And again, they want death.
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  They've given over to death.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  They hate it.
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  They want to be weak.
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:16:58.000]  They want to be pathetic.
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  They want to be falling.
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  I need to read this article.
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  I really did.
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  I'm going to skip the breaks.
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  We have time to do it.
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  Talk about it for an hour.
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  And then I came and find it.
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  Here it is.
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  Now, a lot of this article is true, but at key points, they lie.
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  And I'll go over where they're lying.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  But again, let's get into this report.
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  The Washington Post puts out foreign policy is the name of the
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  publication.
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  They're the ones that announced three years ago, the CIA is
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  taking over domestic media and it's going to lie to you.
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  And it's now legal to spend taxpayer money doing this.
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  This is where the government people read this.
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:52.000]  And they hear, oh, it's in the newspaper.
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  In fact, in DC, at least a while ago, they used to even print a
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  weekly version of it.
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  And it went inside the Washington Post.
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  Oh, it must be normal to lie to people and take over.
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  It's in the newspaper.
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  Okay.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  So it's all to normalize this with everybody and have it be
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  completely kosher.
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  So let's read this article that Paul Watson wrote about this
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  linkedondrugreport.com.
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  The Kremlin is starting to worry about Trump.
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  Vladimir Putin's entourage cheered the outcome of the U.S.
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  election until they saw exactly what they were dealing with.
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  And see, now that Trump is delivering on everything he said
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  he would do or trying, the globalists are really panicking.
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:44.000]  In 2016, a senior Russian official explained to a group of
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  visiting foreigners why the government had decided not to
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  celebrate the upcoming 110th anniversary of the Bolshevik
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  Revolution.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  Now, again, this is a globalist publication to its own people,
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  not to you.
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  So most of it's true.
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  How big is it that they don't celebrate the Bolshevik Revolution
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  something that they always celebrate?
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  Because it's a total repudiation of communism and globalism.
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  And the Russians realized that was a foreign invasion and a
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:16.000]  foreign system.
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  That's in the history books and they're repudiating it.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  But that doesn't even get into all this.
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  It gets into how the elite admit that Trump's for real and
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  actually want to bring back nationalism and really believes
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  in what he's doing and how horrible it is.
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  But see, they'll tell you all day and have Howard Stern tell you,
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  oh, he's fake, it's not real.
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  But they're scared because they know he's real.
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  He took zero Goldman Sachs money, as I said a thousand times.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  Hillary got 100% of it.
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  Speaking of Goldman Sachs, Mnuchin or Munchkin is speaking
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  at a press conference.
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  I wanted to go to this.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  This may be dealing with Flynn.
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  They've been talking about press conferences for hours today.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  Let's go and see what Trump's chief financial advisor has to say.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  He's going meetings with the head of the Federal Reserve.
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:19:58.000]  And I look forward to that now that I'm in office doing that
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:19:59.000]  and spending time with her.
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:01.000]  Thank you very much, everybody.
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:02.000]  It's a pleasure to be here.
[1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  Yeah, he was just announcing what he's going to do.
[1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:05.000]  That's right.
[1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:06.000]  In fact, they said this yesterday.
[1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:08.000]  All right, let's get back to the fun.
[1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:11.000]  Trump is going to be getting rid of the top Federal Reserve
[1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:12.000]  people that are currently there.
[1:20:12.000 --> 1:20:14.000]  He's ordering the new people, this has been announced,
[1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:17.000]  to flood the general public with money and to local banks
[1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:19.000]  and to not the megabanks who just hoarded trillions
[1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:21.000]  and gave literally none of it out.
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:23.000]  They loaned some of it to other banks
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  and they loaned it out at 30% interest and paid a loans.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:31.000]  I mean, that's another big, wonderful thing Trump's doing.
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  To the 80% of the job creators in this country
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  are small businesses.
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:37.000]  Let me get back to the document.
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  Because you read something like this.
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  OK, go back to Spicer on Flynn.
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  Go ahead.
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  General Flynn, on a daily basis for a few weeks,
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  tried to ascertain the truth.
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  We got to a point not based on a legal issue,
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  but based on a trust issue with a level of trust
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  between the President and General Flynn
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  The President was very concerned that General Flynn
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  had misled the Vice President and others.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  He was also very concerned in light of sensitive subjects
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  dealt with by that position of national security advisors
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  like China, North Korea, and the Middle East,
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  that the President must have complete and unwavering trust
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  for the person in that position.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  The evolving and eroding level of trust
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  as a result of this situation
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  in a series of other questionable instances
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  is what led the President to ask for General Flynn's resignation.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  A very strong opinionation.
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  The Department of Justice notified the White House
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  Council of the situation.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  The White House Council briefed the President
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  and a small group of the senior advisors.
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:42.000]  The White House Council reviewed and determined
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  that there is not an illegal issue,
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  but rather a trust issue.
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  During this process, it is important to note
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  that the President did not have his Attorney General,
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  Jeff Sessions, who he trusts immensely,
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  approved by the Senate.
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  When the President heard the information
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  as presented by White House Council,
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  he instinctively thought that General Flynn
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  did not do anything wrong,
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  and the White House Council's review corroborated that.
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  It is not ordinary for an incoming national security advisor
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  to speak with his counterparts
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  about the issues of concern to them.
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  In fact, he spoke with over 30 of his counterparts
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  throughout the transition.
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  As Charles Krauthammer said last night,
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  it is, quote, perfectly reasonable
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  for him to do so.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  The issue here was that the President
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  got to the point where General Flynn's
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  relationship, misleading the Vice President
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  and others, or the possibility
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  that he had forgotten critical details
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  of this important conversation
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  had created a critical mass
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  in an unsustainable situation.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  That is a big mistake.
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  That's why the President decided to ask for his resignation
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  and he got it.
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  They throw him under the bus.
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  And make it about a trust issue when they admit
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  that they know it's just like,
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  hey, can we talk about sanctions later?
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  Yeah, the President, I'm sure he'll talk to you about that.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  Did you talk about sanctions? No, because he didn't.
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  United Nations Nikki Haley stood before
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  the U.N. Security Council on her first day
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  and strongly denounced the Russian occupation
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  of Crimea.
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  As Ambassador Haley said at the time,
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  the dire situation in eastern Ukraine
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  is one that demands clear
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  and strong condemnation.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  Yeah, this is a sacrificial lamb
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  and people inside the White House trying to have a coup
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  to signal they're going to be anti-Russia
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  and claim Russia invaded Ukraine
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  and that George Soros' operation overthrow was a great thing.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  He fully expects to
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  and wants to be able to get along with Russia
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  unlike previous administrations
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  so that we can solve many problems together
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  facing the world, such as the threat of ISIS.
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  This is the military industrial complex
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  where they're bullying Trump
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  and saying you do this
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  or we're going to come after you.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  And watch Trump, they're only going to come after you
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  more now, buddy.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  A decorated and distinguished veteran
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  of the United States Army
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  until that person is ultimately chosen.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  Before I get into the President's schedule
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  for today, a quick recap of the President's
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  activity over the last few days,
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  since we haven't had the honor of sharing so much time
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  together. The President's been keeping it close by.
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  Since I missed the first 30 seconds of this,
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  we rewind it to the start of Spicer.
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  Everybody wants to hear that.
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  Again,
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  I don't have any dog in the fight with Flynn.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  I know what he did, exposing al-Qaeda and ISIS,
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  working with the other military brass to say
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  no to Obama being their air force.
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  Truly historic standing up,
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  unsung, going on TV, exposing that
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  Obama was backing al-Qaeda and ISIS,
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  really helping the military understand
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  that globalists have been allies
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  of Saudi Arabia and some of the worst elements
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  of Islam and the guy's a total hero.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  And he's just not a BSer.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  He's a hands-on guy who works 18, 20 hours a day.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  Totally normal to talk to your
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  foreign counterparts. They had to all admit that.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  And the Russians say,
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  we didn't talk about sanctions. We said, can we talk to Trump about him?
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  He said, I can't speak for the President.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  They admit, I can't speak for the President,
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  but you know, he says he wants to have a clean slate and we'll see what happens.
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  He said, can't speak to you about it.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  And evaluating this issue
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  with respect to General Flynn
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  on a daily basis for a few weeks,
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  trying to ascertain the truth.
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  We got to a point not based on a legal issue,
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  but based on a trust issue
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  with a level of trust between the President
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  and General Flynn had eroded to the point.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  So we did get to it from the start.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  All right, so there's the statement right there.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  This is not going to stop.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  I said this this morning and you see it.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  It's just we're going to get everybody.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  Rex Tillerson's a Russian agent.
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  The Secretary of State.
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  Trump's a Russian agent. Michael Moore said
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  we're going to get Tillerson. We're going to get Bannon.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  And then we're going to get Trump.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  It's going to be your fire.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  And then you've got Sean Spicer
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  and Priebus and Paul Ryan.
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  By the way, the Russians have made statements.
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  They say, look, the Democrats want war with us
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  and the Republicans want to
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  reign Trump in and turn him
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  into a kept creature. We get it.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  It's what we would do.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  They can be just as Machiavelli as anybody
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  and it's this disease of being Machiavelli
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  where people can't stop doing it
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  and just have trade deals
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  and be normal and move out of this war time economy.
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  It doesn't mean we still won't have weapons.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  It doesn't mean China isn't out of control.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  It doesn't mean there's no.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  The globalists are building a world where it's all going to be drones
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  and anti-human and cashless.
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  The big war is against humanity by the technocracy
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  and Trump knows that's why he said
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  we need to build a world for people
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  and we need to create jobs.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  We need to celebrate families.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  But instead
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  and still great things have happened
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  but this is very, very troubling
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  and they are just
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  maneuvering Trump.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  He's still getting a lot done trying to cut the taxes
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  trying to get us out of all this other garbage
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  trying to bring back last eagle
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  and you notice Spicer
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  and Ryan
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  and all of them
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  they run around in circles
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  over and over again
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  and they
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  say
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  that
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  well, no, we're not going to cut taxes right now.
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  We're going to do Obamacare first
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  we're not going to drain the swamp
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  and then Trump goes, what do you mean?
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  Of course we're going to drain the swamp
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  and yes, we're cutting taxes and he's going forward with it
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  and he's doing it. He signed more stuff to start
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  cutting back Obamacare that he can do executive
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  just yesterday. He's doing all sorts of stuff
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  and but they're all
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  clearly working against him.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  Spicer is the least worse
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  because he knows Trump's watching him
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  so he's got to say some of the stuff Trump says
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  but
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  it's bad man
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  and listen, you wanted somebody to go drain the swamp
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  you wanted somebody to fight globalism
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  you wanted somebody to bring God back
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  you wanted somebody to invoke the birthright
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  of Providence
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  Trump gets an A plus on what he's trying to do
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  but when you're pulling from
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  a pool of Republican
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  establishment people that are scared of John McCain
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  they're scared of Lindsey Graham
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  those guys are monsters
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  Kucky Schumer's a monster
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  they know
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  and
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  they want to clapper
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  and Brennan and all these especially Brennan
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  a Wahhabist admittedly
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  openly threatening Trump saying you better watch it
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  two days before Trump gets in
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  that's because he's got the deep state, the globalist
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  all behind him
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  now they're looking over their shoulder because they know
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  the police and military at the grassroots are awake but
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  maybe 65% of the public
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  somewhat awake but we've got to get
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  the rest of the public awake right now
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  I've got a night coming up
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  but I've got to read this article and I've got to read it quick
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  it's long but it's so informative
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  as they admit so much the truth
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  because this is an elite publication to themselves
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  and then I'm going to have David chime in on this whole situation
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  but
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  you've got the Ark type of the big dam there
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  in California that the liberals
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  wouldn't let them fix, they want to tear down the dams
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  saying there's no water of course
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  and they've got all these big reservoirs
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  that don't even have endangered fish in them
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  even indigenous and call them endangered
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  I know it's crazy, like Klamath
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  and not let you have water
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  to run everybody out of the lands, they can buy it up
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  and then it's so emblematic
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  of the collapsing country
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  and people ask, you know, why aren't you covering this more
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:00.000]  well I know it's really interesting and I know it's emblematic
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  and I know it's the liberals
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  and democrats that basically blocked it
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  getting repaired or fixed and it also shows
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:08.000]  how they've got all these reservoirs full of water
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:10.000]  but they won't let it flow
[1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  people say, oh well they've got a lot of rain now
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  but it's been dry, no folks
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:16.000]  they've got a six or seven big reservoirs
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  from northern California all the way down
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:20.000]  that are just full and they go
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:22.000]  sorry, the such and such fish is endangered
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:24.000]  and people go, that's not even from here
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:26.000]  and they go, doesn't matter, we see
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:28.000]  it's good for the ecosystem
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:30.000]  you can't have the water
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:32.000]  it's just overflowing and flooding everything
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:34.000]  you can't have it, sorry
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  oh I guess it's overflowing
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:38.000]  I guess you can have some now
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  nobody even knows how to evacuate
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  shows if there's a big earthquake which they're overdue for
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:44.000]  it's gonna be a time bomb
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  whatever man, I tell ya
[1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:48.000]  the people even deserve freedom
[1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  we're on the march
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:52.000]  the empire's on the run
[1:29:52.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:22.000]  are more
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:24.000]  stronger than anything else on the market
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:26.000]  you've talked to people that have been using this
[1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  actually testing it for years, people that currently
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:30.000]  are testing it for us, they didn't just say outstanding
[1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  what they really say about them
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:34.000]  they want to know how do they get it, where do they find it
[1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  a lot of my law enforcement official buddies
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  want to know the same thing
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:40.000]  the backpack body armor is only $200
[1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:42.000]  I mean it's unbelievable
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:44.000]  it's a quarter inch thick, it's got a 20 year warranty
[1:30:44.000 --> 1:30:46.000]  it's waterproof, you can wear it, it's comfortable
[1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:48.000]  and we shot everything you can imagine of it
[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:50.000]  again, fund the info
[1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  or kit the game changing in nanotech

[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  but I want to read this incredibly
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  important article
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  by Foreign Policy which is the Washington Post
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:42.000]  version of foreign affairs
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  the council on farm relations
[1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  because they got so into the act of
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  everything's KKK and Trump's retarded
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  and Trump's mentally ill
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  and Trump's you know a narcissist
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  that normally they write
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  pretty accurate reports because it's what the establishment
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  reads
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  oh yeah the CIA is going to run everything and take over free press
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  because you know we know best
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  I mean it's just crazy stuff so
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  their own people in a Washington Post insert
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  you know once a month can read the magazine
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  and also read it online
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  and kind of get their marching orders
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  it's like a tragedy and hope
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  that Quigley wrote back in the 60s
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  so the top folks in the State Department
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  can understand we fund fascism but
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  communism and socialism as long as
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  it's authoritarian we fund it it's what we want
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  and we've taken over both parties
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  we have the illusion of change
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  we want to carry out social engineering
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  that's the real system and all of the world
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  people are trying to pull out of it
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  well the branding is
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  urination your people
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  you want your own sovereignty
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  you want to run your own show and not be under exploitive
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  third wave corporate colonialism
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  that's globalism
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  but reversing using third world
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  populations and vulcanization
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  for the exploitation and control and driving down
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  of wages and looting of the first world
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  and having no escape
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  to the third world
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  what do you do outside threat you're an outside
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  globalist force you admit you are
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  people wake up to that you go oh my gosh
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  the Russians everywhere that
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  countries are trying to pull out it's it's it's not that
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  Italy doesn't want to be under EU
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  dictatorship literally and have all their power taken away
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  no it's the Russians
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  UK and never got to vote to enter
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  the Euro it's not that they want to be free or sovereign
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  and not have giant taxes it's the Russians
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  again where'd your homework go
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  the Russians ate it
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  sorry officer didn't know I was speeding the Russians broke my speedometer
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  yeah
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  some even said the Russians must have hacked
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  the Super Bowl I thought it was a joke
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  when I heard that if they were actually saying that
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  that's Trump's team the Russians paid off
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  the but see
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  they asked Flynn
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  they said you talk about
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  sanctions with Russia
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  he said no we talked about line up
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  and you know
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  discussion with the president that's what I'm told to do and they said
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  and later was all being recorded the Russians are when do we
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  talk about sanctions well I'm sure he'll talk about that with you
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  that's not talking about sanctions and the president said
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  well I thought you never talked about influence and I don't remember
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  I didn't talk about substantive
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  why are we running scared of them saying this
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  and then recording us you're the president
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  you can go make treaties with Russia you can do whatever you want
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  they got a tiger by the tail sir
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  don't listen to Jared and don't listen to
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  all the other guys
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  don't listen to Spicer
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  don't listen to
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  previous
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  and
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  Trump got rid of
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  and I'm not disagreeing with Trump because
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  there was some other paperwork issues that I knew about
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  separately that people thought he wouldn't even get in there because of
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  so I'm not saying it's an overall bad decision
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  but
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  I guess
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  if Trump's going to fire somebody he'll do it decisively
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  and say there's a trust issue but I think that's
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  just a stupid way and puts more blood in the water
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  to say it had become too confusing
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  we clearly didn't do anything illegal but she didn't
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  they all admit it's totally normal
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  but it's just that he didn't say I talked
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  about it with it
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  like if somebody asked me
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  you know out in this parking lot hey you want to buy my car and I said
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  yeah maybe down the road let's talk
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  about it next week people said hey did you discuss
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  buying a car and I was like no not really
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  he asked me if I wanted one but I didn't discuss the details of it
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  I mean it's literally
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  parsing hairs how many
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  angels can dance on the head of a pen
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  but but I get it
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  the answer is yeah they asked me about sanctions
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  I said refer it to you
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  that means squeeze
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  everything out until the president everything
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  let me hit some of this article
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  I'll go over more of it with David
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  this is the Kremlin is starting to worry about
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  Trump and the article really
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  doesn't say much about that it's more of just a communication
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  the world that Trump's for real
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  and he's super dangerous because he's real
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  now listen to this
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  the last thing the Russian government expected
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  was a 2017 would bring
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  it face to face
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  with not a revolution of the past
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  because they say they're canceling the Bolshevik Revolution
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  celebration for the first you know
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  the 100th year anniversary Putin doesn't like it
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  he says it's bad they twist that and say
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  because Putin's afraid of revolutions no
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  Putin was a secret acolyte of Alexander
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  Sheldon needs and that's all admitted now
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  and doesn't like communism and what the west
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  did to Russia and he wants
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  Russia to become a superpower
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  and be strong and free markets
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  they had people get married having kids
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  Christian anti-globalists
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  they're banning the tranny bathrooms okay
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  they're the opposite of Hollywood
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  and Hollywood knows it
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  Christianity's coming back there
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  it's real and all the cold war brainwashers
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  don't want people to believe
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  the proof of what's happening
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  and Soros has been trying to overthrow it
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  desperately
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  so the last thing Russian government expected
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  2017 would bring it face to face
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  not with a revolution of the past
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  well the revolution of the present
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  the radical regime change taking place in the United States
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  as a result of the electoral victory of Donald Trump
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  it is Trump's electoral
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  revolution that has captured the imagination
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  and fanned the fears
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  of Russian elites that's not true
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  they're breaking
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  completely with communism and this whole
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  free market model and embracing it
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  now
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  now it gets into the truth though they're going to say
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  Trump isn't narcissistic and mentally ill
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  he's actually a hardcore revolutionary
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  that believes in Americanism
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  listen to this
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  the search for a key to Trump's mind boggling
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  and miscellaneous gusher of policies
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  not miscellaneous it's all targeted for free
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  the people
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  the search for a key to Trump's mind boggling
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  and miscellaneous gusher of policy
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  directives
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  has tended to focus on his
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  disturbingly erratic
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  vindictive simplistic narcissistic
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  insecure and occasionally delusional personality
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  then they go on to say that's not the case
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  there's no exception
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  being made for those conspiracy theorists
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  who treat him as a kind of Manchurian candidate
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  or sock puppet of the Kremlin
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  see this is the CIA writes this
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  they're saying he's not a Russian agent
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  he's worse get ready
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  what most observers
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  have been late to recognize
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  is the extent to which behind his mask
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  as a showman
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  Trump views himself as a revolutionary
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  insurgent with a mission to dismantle
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  America's old regime
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  that's the secret
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  then they go on and say Russia they're going to see
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  this man on you he means it
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  he means it
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  come on come on you don't really want to do this do you
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  he's going to take over
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  it's like selling snowcones in hell
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  to promote freedom over the globalist
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  everybody wants one
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  ladies and gentlemen
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  Donald Trump's like a big old glass of
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  ice water after you run a marathon
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  with that
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  water dripping down the edges and the sides
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  and that's what he's doing there's some problems
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  because his own governments in revolt
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  doing whatever it wants now but what he's pushing
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  what he's doing is amazing
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  and it goes on
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  to quote Bannon and others about how
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  we're going to break the will of the collectives
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  when people pour in Dhamma we're going to empower humanity
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  we're going to build bridges of people that want to work with us
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  and we're going to build the super rail
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  and we're going to build rail
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  you know perhaps across the ocean I mean it's all
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  just as big ideas what makes humans great
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  we built the Panama Canal 100 years ago
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  folks are more
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  we don't do anything like that now
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  big ideas is what we operate on
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  and so they go on in this
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  long article
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  and they admit that America is going to be vastly
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  more powerful now because it's going to take over
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  the organs of globalism but do it in soft
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  power and use it to empower people and that this
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  will unset the entire international order
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  and that Russia will never be able to
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  dominate this and it will defeat the globalist
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  and Russia so the globalists are saying
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  don't do it Russia
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  no
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  America will be too powerful see
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  everybody's supposed to sink
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  and then Russia's been infiltrated by globalists
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  and they go on to threaten him and they go
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  we know you have globalists in your cabinet
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  we know you have billions of globalist money
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  we know you've been double playing the globalist Putin
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  and there's globalists in your very office
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  that we know are against Trump
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  and Trump is going to destroy them
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  and they go listen he's real dangerous he's real
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  please don't do it just please
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  and then they go on to say yeah the Russian people
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  sense that and they're and they just you got
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  to deal with them too because you better watch out
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  they're going to overthrow you Putin
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  yeah they sense Trump's real this revolution's powerful
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  and it's worldwide you better roll over
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  Putin because let me tell you this Trump's
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  bad
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  I mean they go on right there to say
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  Trump's the real deal folks
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  and they and they tell Russia
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  you're evil like us aren't you
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  help us stop Trump
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  this is the big come to Jesus moment
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  is Russia good or is Russia really evil
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  what's really happening
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  Trump's real
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  all right David Knight you laid it out really good
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  in a one-minute boil down that I'm going to air here in a moment
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  from earlier in the broadcast
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  the one-minute hot topics
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  but I mean you just nailed it
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  the blackmail is the globalist with this
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  made-up Russia crap
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:42:58.000]  yeah and and and just
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:00.000]  all of this and I think the sacrificial lamb
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:02.000]  is a miscalculation
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:04.000]  except for I know about
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:06.000]  other paperwork issues
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:08.000]  that Trump reportedly just said oh that's nothing
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  it was it really is nothing he's the president
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  I mean the president can do whatever deals he wants
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:14.000]  that's that's what he does is international stuff
[1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:16.000]  and Congress approves it this idea that the president
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:18.000]  and his people can't talk to the Russians
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:20.000]  is just asinine go ahead
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:22.000]  we know Alex the thing that they're so concerned about
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  was something that phone call that happened
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  seven weeks after the election three weeks
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  before the inauguration it was on the day
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  that the Obama administration decided
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  that they were going to do some last-minute
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  interference with the Trump administration
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:36.000]  by imposing sanctions
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:38.000]  by throwing out Russian diplomats or spies
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:40.000]  or whatever they were but nevertheless
[1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:42.000]  I can imagine that when Flynn was talking to them
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  just as you said earlier that this wasn't
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  a key part of what they were talking about
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  I can imagine maybe he called him up to talk about Syria
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  and the Russian ambassador said you see all this stuff
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:52.000]  that happened today the sanctions and the other stuff
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  yeah don't worry about it well I should admit it
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  I mean I should admit it
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  yeah exactly and so
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:00.000]  what he said in his letter was he said
[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:02.000]  I inadvertently left out some details
[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  he did not mislead he did not lie to them
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  and as you know
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  we have a two-hour conversation at dinner like we've had before
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:10.000]  and we say what you about at dinner all mainly
[1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:12.000]  the work in the news
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  you didn't tell me you talked about
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  how you once had a
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  VW van or just
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  that happens to me
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  my wife all the time is like
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  I'm thinking the central part
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:26.000]  of the conversation is this or that and then later on
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  I said oh you know we mentioned something about
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:30.000]  you know cars I'm glad you didn't tell me you talked about
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  the car and it's like what was important
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  anything is just a side thing
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  but I'm sure that's what happened but Alex
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  I think this is a self inflicted
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  wound and you know when you're swimming with sharks
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  you can't cut yourself in the water
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:44.000]  and now the sharks are turning around
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  we've got the Democrats who are saying this is
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  just the beginning that's the chairman of the
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  House Democrat Congress
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  caucus he said this is just the beginning
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:54.000]  this is bigger than Flynn but even more importantly Alex
[1:44:54.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  we've got a GOP Senator
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  who's on the Senate Intelligence Committee
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:00.000]  Roy Blunt and he's
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  saying there needs to be an exhaustive investigation
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  of the ties between Russia and Trump
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  and he's saying we need to find out
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  we need to get Flynn in here we need to grill him we need to know
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  what did he know that's right this is a Republican party
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  you know it coming into bully
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  and take over the libertarian
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  Americana movement and because
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  Roy Blunt is somebody who I'm sure
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  he has deep ties with the
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  CIA he sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  during the election he
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  tried to distance himself from Trump for political reasons
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  he said I'm not really sure I don't know
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  if he eventually wound up going to the RNC
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  he said he wasn't going to go because he didn't want
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  to tie himself closely to Trump
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  with Flynn we've got somebody as you pointed
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  out who was Frank in his assessment
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  he exposed the CIA's
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:42.000]  surrogates whether they
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  want to call them al-Qaeda or ISIS it's the same
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  thing they're being run by the CIA
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  and so it was a masterful move
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  we thought when Trump put this guy
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  in charge of intelligence
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:54.000]  here and now he had to be
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  removed by the intelligence and I want to be clear
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:45:58.000]  I'm not trying to again lionize
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:00.000]  the CIA but the good
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:02.000]  people on the CIA had a huge part in all
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:04.000]  the info coming out about how we were backing al-Qaeda
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  and ISIS and stopping that and whistle
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  blowing but it's the globalist at the
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:10.000]  top that are trying to sabotage
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  and that we're surveilling president elect
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:14.000]  Trump like he's some type of Russian
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  agent the president could talk to the
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  Russians all he wants he's the president
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  that's why we elected him he's our leader
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:22.000]  well absolutely and think about what
[1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  happened Alex when the intelligence
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:26.000]  people recorded this
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:28.000]  conversation they provided
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:30.000]  a transcript to David Ignatius
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  at the Washington Post they also
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  gave the information to Sally Yates
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  who is an Obama holdover and the
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:38.000]  as attorney general so now you have an illegal
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:40.000]  spying going on against US citizens
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:42.000]  and giving it to the media and
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:44.000]  that's why Trump says the real story here
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:46.000]  are the illegal leaks they've been doing
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  this repeatedly to embarrass Trump
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:50.000]  to try to entrap him in something
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:52.000]  well let's go further to this fired
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:54.000]  energy of the justice department
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:56.000]  that's a good point you make that I mean
[1:46:56.000 --> 1:46:58.000]  it's the justice department that's been blackmailing
[1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  yeah yeah absolutely with Sally Yates
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  who did this Sally Yates gets this
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:04.000]  information from the people and the intelligence
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:06.000]  or I would call him the Stasi state
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:08.000]  because that's the way these people are acting now
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:10.000]  this is a surveillance state that is
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:12.000]  using its intelligence
[1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:14.000]  capability its eavesdropping
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  capability as a political
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:18.000]  weapon against Donald Trump
[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  remember that even before the election
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:22.000]  we had John Brennan who was
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:24.000]  the sitting head of the CIA
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:26.000]  campaigning against Donald Trump
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  I've never seen anything like that in my entire life
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:30.000]  for the CIA to be that openly political
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:32.000]  we know they go around they manipulate
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  things they do stuff in secret they
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  assassinate people but now they're doing this kind of stuff
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  and open sure and it gets worse than that
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  then we have all these foreign leaders
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:42.000]  weighing in and giving money to Hillary
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  and Hillary meeting secretly with Putin
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  and all the money going back and forth so everything
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  they say about Trump they've done
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  but this is a point Macadoo made last night
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  and I looked into this this is true because I know
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  how Twitter works and Watson's
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  going to do a report on this
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  Trump they first said get rid of his Twitter feed
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  a few months ago they talked about taking it away
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  from the president that's how I heard there
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:04.000]  now they just block any positive
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  tweets from the top hundred you've got
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  to see more even though almost all of it's
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  positive so when you go look at his tweets
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  all you see is people attacking here
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  let's put it up so
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  Trump comes out and says
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  the real story here is
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  why are there so many illegal leaks
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  coming out of Washington will the leaks
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  be happening as I deal with North Korea
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  or you bet they will etc but then
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  if you open it up it's like good morning
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  real Donald Trump let's recap you lose court
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  cases you have totally going to be overturned
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  you lose appeal that's going to be overturned
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  if they're 80% reversed your Supreme Court
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  pick insults you
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  Flynn just resigns
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  and you know that's a good point there are a lot of
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  backstabbers not a lot of people with Trump's courage
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  and again it's not that I want to lionize
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  Trump he is like a lion with all these
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:50.000]  wolves attacking him
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  and really is trying to do good and everything
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  is aligned against him and then I hear all
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  this sniveling that we're backing
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  a Goldman Sachs person when
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  the people he put in from Goldman Sachs are battling
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  Goldman Sachs and they're destroying
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  Goldman Sachs global government and the TPP
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  that Goldman Sachs basically created
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  with Hillary and again
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  he got zero money from them and they
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  banned their employees giving money
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  to Trump which is by the way illegal
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  so I mean but then all the
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  pseudo fake conservatives and pseudo
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  fake liberals get to be high and mighty
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  David and say oh
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  we're supporting the big elite president
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  as he desperately tries to cut their taxes
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  and regulations and kill the carbon
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  tax so the big question
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  is David does the average American out there
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  deserve Donald Trump?
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  Probably not Alex and you know
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  when I saw that David Petrez is one
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  of the people they're touting as being one of the
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:42.000]  three to replace Michael Flynn it's like
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  are you serious are you seriously
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  considering the guy who next to Hillary
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  Clinton the person that he supported
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  he's also anti-gun supported Hillary
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  Clinton yeah absolutely so
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  you look at that you look at Sally Yates who
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  is saying hey he could be blackmailed and she's the one
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  who's doing the blackmailing it's absolutely amazing
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  and then of course yesterday I talked about the fact
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  that we're banding about the Logan Act
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  which you pointed out many times
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  at Bilderberg and we talked about
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  how you pointed out again in 2012
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  these people are coming in in violation of the
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  Logan Act and yet they go to a private
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  meeting to try to use the Logan Act
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  against Michael Flynn
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  Exactly the Logan Act
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:20.000]  is government officials meeting
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  at a private corporate meeting to discuss
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  their private business in a
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  government capacity selling favors
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  it's not the incoming national security advisor
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  making the routine hundreds of phone calls
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  to world leaders and chief
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  ambassadors are supposed to make and they admit that
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  and they're meeting at Davos
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  talking about how they can undermine
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  the Trump administration that's precisely
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  what we're talking about with the Logan Act
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  but they get away with it let's expand on that we should all point out
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  Communist China openly
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  admits they're manipulating our media and against
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  Trump and Democrats are openly
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  working with them with Republicans but that's
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  okay for the Chinese president to say
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  don't worry I'll defeat Trump
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  and the conservatives

[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  We've had John Brennan,
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:18.000]  wild director of the CIA
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  actively campaigning against Trump
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  We've seen the surveillance state leaking to embarrass Trump
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  and now they've maneuvered to get Flynn
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  out in a move worthy of Stalin
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  The surveillance state gave transcripts of Flynn's
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  phone calls to the Washington Post
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  to put him under a microscope
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  to see if they could find something
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  Bring me the man, I'll find the crime
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  Flynn said he inadvertently left out details
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  when he briefed Pence
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  He didn't say he lied, he didn't say he misled
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  Were the sanctions and expulsions mentioned in passing?
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  Not really the topic of conversation?
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  We don't know, but the Washington Post knows
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  Sally Yates, the Obama holdover
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  who was just fired for gross insubordination
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  Yeah, it was Yates who was blackmailing
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  And if you think they're really concerned about security
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  One of the three names being put forward
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  to take Flynn's place is David Petraeus
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  the man who is second in the betrayal
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  of national security, only to the presidential candidate
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  that he supported, Hillary Clinton
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  And immediately, Democrats call for more
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  of Trump's cabinet appointments to be investigated
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  You can't appease Stalinists
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  ForeverWars.com, I'm David Knight
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  Alright, now
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  David's gonna pop back in for five minutes the next hour
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  We've got a few minutes left here, I'm gonna make a point
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  They're now saying Trump
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  violated national security when he's the president
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  when he met with the Japanese president
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  at their dinner and
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  showed photos
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  of the North Korean launch that's been on the news
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  You understand the CIA
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  and all these other agencies classify
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  newspaper articles and say that no one in the CIA
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  is allowed to read them, if they don't want
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  stuff heard, there's more
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  BS there than anything
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  It's like, oh look, there's photos
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  of Trump with the prime minister
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  looking at satellite photos
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  and looking at stuff, holy moly
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  Oh my gosh, it's treason
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  to have two world leaders meet
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  This is great how they're working at dinner
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  and talking about North Korea
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  This is a president that's actually engaged
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  And Trump's on the phone getting stuff done
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  I mean, it's just amazing
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  Let's say we like Hillary Clinton and Jerry Epstein
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  a little pedophile crew
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  And I've got so much other news to get to
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  It's just incredible
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  There's a lot of good news taking place as well
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  But look at this, George Soros
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  insider, banks ending cash
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  to establish world government
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  This has been publicly announced in the newspapers
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  They're just, I'm going to cover this
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  mainstream newspapers, oh yeah
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  We're setting up world government
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  We're not going to have any cash
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  But the crazy conspiracy theorists say we're going to do that
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  But we are
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  Farage, blisters EU parliament
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  forecast 2017 popular surge
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  Let me tell you two big points here
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  I'll talk about this when I come back with David
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  Two things need to happen
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  Trump needs to organize a true American
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  party within the Republican party
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  to go after all the Republican blue bloods
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  and try to block his agenda
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  And he's got to come out and do what I've told him
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  over the phone, I begged him to do
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  I said you got to go after him for working with the
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  communist Chinese and getting money from them
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  and how the Chinese governments openly
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  saying they're going to block you, sir
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  That's oping and espionage and they're going to claim you're a Russian
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  and they're never going to stop
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:22.000]  You got to do it, man
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  He's got to take them out
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  with the crimes they've committed
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  or they're going to frame him and us and shut this whole thing down
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  Because God forbid we get
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  taxes cut on poor people
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  And God forbid we build some super rail and
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  God forbid we get some jobs back in Detroit
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  And God forbid we don't pay carbon taxes
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  Nobody else has to pay them
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  God almighty
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  Listen, I plugged so little
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:46.000]  I'm so focused that we had
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:48.000]  Buckley came in this morning and last night
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:50.000]  the accountant said we're losing money right now
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  You need to make some money, Mr. Jones
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:54.000]  Because we're not making that much selling a much toothpaste
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:56.000]  because we don't make any money on that
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  We're selling a lot of toothpaste though
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  It's fluoride free with
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:02.000]  nano silver and also iodine
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  It's great, super blue
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:06.000]  Proprietary, it's amazing, best out there
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:08.000]  maybe the biggest lab in the country but our proprietary blend

[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  Yeah, I still
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:24.000]  open doors for little old ladies
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:26.000]  I still try to help the blind
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  to see
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  I got no friends
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  They can't be seen
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:38.000]  with me
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  You know, I am
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  in the same
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  guild, the same
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  brotherhood as Trump
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  It's not even admiring
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  it's that I'm in the same zeitgeist
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  I know Trump really wants to restore the Republic
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  He really had not to get you, that's all
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  and he really knows what the global
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  star, a bunch of pedophile devil wars
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  versus he wants to fight them
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  and he gets demonized
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  he gets lied about, I mean there's
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  weeks ago, it's now in the news
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  Keith Schiller, who's been
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  Trump's bodyguard for almost 30 years
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  veteran New York police
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  officer before that, done a great job
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  Trump's keeping him for good reasons
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  Hell, they've caught secret service agents
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  planning all sorts of stuff and saying they hope Trump dies
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  basically, not that all the secret service is bad
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  but they're coming after him
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  and he knows that
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  and I know more about his security than just that
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  he trusts military people
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  so Trump's got multiple layers
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  and people watching watchers
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:36.000]  he's got the Department of Defense
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  watching the secret service, the secret service isn't bad
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  it's just super infiltrated
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  and
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  just like the Russians
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  are saying we're afraid they're going to kill Trump
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  Hell, they're on every channel there is saying kill Trump
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  so in closing, looking at that
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  I mean this is so real David
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  the news is so over the top
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  insanely sensational
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  that I
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  I've never in my life had anxiety attacks
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  but I really thought about what I'm having
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  where I have trouble breathing now a lot of times
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  when I'm looking at this I'm like
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  I'm waking up at 3.30 in the morning and I'm just like
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  this is a freaking nightmare man
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  we have these horrible pedophiles running everything
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  they're openly moving against Trump
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  they're saying he's a freaking Russian spy
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  and he can't talk to the Japanese president about North Korea
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  I mean it's just so obvious that the bad guys
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:22.000]  are out to get Trump, what do you say?
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  Absolutely, that's the most amazing thing
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  that they would try to make something out of this meeting
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  with the Japanese Prime Minister
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  Alex this underscores the fact
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  that if he doesn't go on offense
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  he can't just play defense, they're going to keep coming
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  after him no matter how absurd the charges
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  here's an example of
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  some more of the double standard
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  when the Hill talks about Trump saying the real
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  story here are the illegal leaks
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:46.000]  are you going to try to undermine me when I'm dealing with North Korea?
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  Well of course they are, they're going to do anything that they can
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  but then at the bottom of the story
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  what the Hill says is well during the campaign
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  he signals his affection
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  for leaks that were hurting Hillary Clinton
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  well that's a very different thing because
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  in those leaks and certainly
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:02.000]  WikiLeaks and Julian Assange did not like Hillary Clinton
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  just like the NSA
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  and the surveillance state doesn't like
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  Donald Trump because he's exposing
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:10.000]  along with Michael Flynn what had happened
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  in Syria and other places
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  but when we saw those leaks about Hillary Clinton
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  we saw them in complete
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  we saw them in full context
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  what we're seeing here this being leaked out
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  selectively to the Washington Post
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  and then they only tell us
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  their view on it and they never show it to us
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  because when they later come out it's all a bunch of bull
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  it's an innuendo
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  and so what they say well you know
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  he talked to them about
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  you know he talked to the Russians
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:38.000]  about the sanctions or whatever
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:40.000]  we don't know what that was it wasn't substantial
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  I'm sure it wasn't substantial but we're never going to see that transcript
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  Washington Post will see it
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:46.000]  the Democrat acting attorney general
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  look he comes down to this who do we trust
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  Donald Trump and the generals
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  and patriots and banning with the history
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  for this country or a bunch of globalists
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:56.000]  scum that openly have the night
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  circuit ruling that kids in California
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  can't wear American flag shirts
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:02.000]  I mean it's the enemy
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  I mean it's ridiculous
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  it's like saying I'm a Russian agent
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  that's ridiculous
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  we look at Sally A. to the Department of Justice
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:12.000]  it just reminds us of all these hangovers from the Obama administration
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  same thing is true in the CIA
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  same thing is true in the EPA
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  the thing that really concerns me
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  Alex is going back to the election
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  and openly involving himself
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  in a domestic election
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  that was beyond belief
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  it used to be the CIA
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  if they did it in foreign countries
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  exactly I want you to finish that
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  we'll go to our next guest
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  it's signaled though
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  not just that the overthrow of foreign countries are trying this here
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  that they're arrogantly were lining up to do it
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  they wouldn't have 20 newspapers
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  Hollywood stars
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  comedians TV stars
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  saying kill Trump
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  every day and nothing happens
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  if they weren't planning something big
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  these people want to mount America's head
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  on the wall
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:05:18.000]  I'm scared of our power
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:28.000]  we don't know
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:30.000]  but the Washington Post knows
[2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:32.000]  Sally Yates the Obama holdover
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:34.000]  who was just fired for gross insubordination
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:36.000]  said Flynn could be blackmailed
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  yeah it was Yates who was blackmailing
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:40.000]  and if you think they're really concerned about security

[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  in the
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:08.000]  Somalia and see how much she likes that

[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:18.000]  on a slave block in Somalia i said
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:20.000]  if she's up there whining and the whole thing is about
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  let the islamists into the country
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  and

[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:28.000]  she literally
[2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  would be enslaved and gang raped

[2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:50.000]  i mean it's outrageous that they're bitching
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:52.000]  about the west

[2:10:54.000 --> 2:10:56.000]  different people i was talking about
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  and just put it on her to make me look like some mean guy

[2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:02.000]  that are doing that but that's my example
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:04.000]  of how this just goes on and on and on
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:06.000]  see i don't plan a lot of stuff around the show

[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:18.000]  that north korea launched
[2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:20.000]  and then they just sit there and say look

[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  separately

[2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  it was fascinating
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:36.000]  to watch the flurry of activity at the dinner
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:38.000]  when the news came that north korea
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  launched a missile in the direction of japan
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  the prime minister abe of japan huddled with the staff
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  and the president is on the phone
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:46.000]  with washington dc
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:48.000]  the two world leaders then
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:50.000]  conference and then it went into another room
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:52.000]  to freshly arranged press conference
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:54.000]  wow the center of action

[2:12:56.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  so now the president can't even
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:00.000]  watch the news
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:04.000]  photos appear to show donald trump

[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:08.000]  at the mart along go patio
[2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  trump works seven

[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  on four months of golf vacation
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  like obama who just would say
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:30.000]  i got briefed the next day
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  you see the japanese leader of him are just run off
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  to confer and they're like is that sensitive
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:36.000]  is that because you know the president he doesn't
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  even get to read the newspaper
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  he can't talk to anybody
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:42.000]  he's got to go through the republican party
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:44.000]  and linsey graham is high and mighty
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  and if we don't do it linsey graham says
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:48.000]  it's all over they have a night michael
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  steiner's with us for the rest of the hour i want
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  you to get some final comments this is
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:54.000]  just an incredible time to be alive but the
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:56.000]  good news for me is nationalism
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:13:58.000]  awakening to the globalist to their criminal
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  system is exploding everywhere and there's
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  no way they can put the genie back in the
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  bottle but listeners need to know
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  i wouldn't expand
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:08.000]  in the face of all this if i didn't think we
[2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  couldn't beat it and quite frankly i don't like
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:12.000]  to manage people i don't want to we have
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  responsibility i know for a fact that bright
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:16.000]  light is exploding other major patriot sites
[2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:18.000]  are contracting because a lot of people think
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  the war is over even though it just begun
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  we're exploding because our listeners get it
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  but i don't want to continue to explode against
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:28.000]  the enemy i want to beat them they're dangerous
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:30.000]  i'm not afraid to die man but i don't want
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:32.000]  to you understand i got up at
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  3 30 in the morning because i could
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:36.000]  just see energy i can feel it it's in the
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  everybody feels it
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  i want to rest i don't want this fight to
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  keep going but you know what my
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  flesh
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  just doesn't have what it takes my spirit is

[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:54.000]  how evil they are it's not like some
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:14:56.000]  football game where i want to beat the globalist
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  just because they're the enemy they're bad

[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:12.000]  tweeted pizza gate his son did

[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  this is all about child trafficking around the
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:20.000]  world

[2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:12.000]  backyards
[2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:14.000]  all right uh david night final
[2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:16.000]  comments we're going to our next guest i appreciate
[2:16:16.000 --> 2:16:18.000]  your fine work
[2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:20.000]  alex one of the things that concerns me is i think
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:22.000]  trump is acting too presidential during the elections
[2:16:22.000 --> 2:16:24.000]  he was not averse to intimidating his opponents
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:26.000]  that's how he won the election
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:28.000]  now i think they are starting to intimidate him
[2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:30.000]  they're using everything they can to try to embarrass him
[2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:32.000]  and they've got a hit list they've got flinn
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:34.000]  they've got bannon they've got miller they've got
[2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:36.000]  most of the people that are cored understanding
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:38.000]  what's going on with globalism and they want to take them
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:40.000]  out and they've just taken out flinn
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:42.000]  they're trying to take out bannon by embarrassing
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:44.000]  trump putting bannon up on the cover
[2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:46.000]  of time magazine saying he's the real brains
[2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:48.000]  behind the operations they do the same thing to me
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:50.000]  they say alex jones runs trump
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:52.000]  because they can't stand he's reading the news
[2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:54.000]  side at night that's right and with miller
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:56.000]  somebody who's been a very astute
[2:16:56.000 --> 2:16:58.000]  advisor to both sessions and now to trump
[2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:00.000]  of course he helped to bring
[2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:02.000]  sessions along on the immigration issues on tpp
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:04.000]  as well
[2:17:04.000 --> 2:17:06.000]  we've now got john dean from watergate
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:08.000]  saying he's going down they've got a
[2:17:08.000 --> 2:17:10.000]  list here of the people who understand the
[2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:12.000]  problem who are pushing back against it at the
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:14.000]  same time we see people in france saying
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:16.000]  for the first time after watching brexit
[2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:18.000]  after watching trump win an election
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:20.000]  for the first time i believe that my vote can
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:22.000]  really do something here in france we're hearing the same
[2:17:22.000 --> 2:17:24.000]  stuff from the voters in france and of course
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:26.000]  they're using because they're the globalists
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:28.000]  and soros has admittedly hired google
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:30.000]  soros has hired google to block
[2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:32.000]  all the nationalist groups again
[2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:34.000]  and the state departments with soros
[2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:36.000]  even though trump supposedly runs it
[2:17:36.000 --> 2:17:38.000]  soros still runs the state department
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:40.000]  and is trying to stop the nationalist movement
[2:17:40.000 --> 2:17:42.000]  but it gets better
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:44.000]  trying to stop the islamists
[2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:46.000]  because they're russian agents man
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:48.000]  didn't you know that you didn't have your kids
[2:17:48.000 --> 2:17:50.000]  you didn't have your life you didn't build your
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:52.000]  engineering company you didn't build your other retail
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:54.000]  companies you didn't do all the things you did
[2:17:54.000 --> 2:17:56.000]  exposing people having toxic stuff tested on
[2:17:56.000 --> 2:17:58.000]  david you were animated by russia
[2:17:58.000 --> 2:18:00.000]  your mother when she laid down on her back
[2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:02.000]  to give birth to you boy that was a russian
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:04.000]  and that's what they're saying in france now
[2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:06.000]  they're saying the russians are going to hack our elections
[2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:08.000]  and so forth they're losing everywhere alex
[2:18:08.000 --> 2:18:10.000]  in greece the people are now saying we'd rather
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:12.000]  use the us dollar
[2:18:12.000 --> 2:18:14.000]  rather than the euro and so
[2:18:14.000 --> 2:18:16.000]  they're losing this battle but they're not giving up
[2:18:16.000 --> 2:18:18.000]  and and he's got to go
[2:18:18.000 --> 2:18:20.000]  on offense not on defense
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:22.000]  he's got to intimidate these people he's got to
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:24.000]  identify who these traders
[2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:26.000]  are in the surveillance state
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:28.000]  openly trying to subvert our elections
[2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:30.000]  like john brennan and his cronies
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:32.000]  he's got to get those people out of the surveillance
[2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:34.000]  state this is a solemnist
[2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:36.000]  state that is in washington and they're working with
[2:18:36.000 --> 2:18:38.000]  the democrats in the mainstream media
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:40.000]  these are people that study evil they love
[2:18:40.000 --> 2:18:42.000]  evil they think you're crazy if you're not mackie
[2:18:42.000 --> 2:18:44.000]  bellion they'd rob somebody for a dollar
[2:18:44.000 --> 2:18:46.000]  instead of make a thousand with them they're just
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:48.000]  all about dominating and screwing everyone over
[2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:50.000]  they're just an infestering group of devil
[2:18:50.000 --> 2:18:52.000]  worshipers and i say that because that's what they are
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  folks they're devil worshipers it's all about them
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:18:56.000]  it's a different variety some are actual
[2:18:56.000 --> 2:18:58.000]  classic ones others are pedophiles others
[2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:00.000]  but they're just all about them them them
[2:19:00.000 --> 2:19:02.000]  when when when hurt everybody else
[2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:04.000]  david night thank you so much god bless you
[2:19:04.000 --> 2:19:06.000]  thank you alice paul wasen's house for the next
[2:19:06.000 --> 2:19:08.000]  hour let's go now i appreciate michael
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:10.000]  steiner joining us we're going to skip this
[2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:12.000]  breaks we have more time the economic class
[2:19:12.000 --> 2:19:14.000]  blog he wrote about it then he got picked up
[2:19:14.000 --> 2:19:16.000]  in the hill the new york post almost with the
[2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:18.000]  same headline a secret army
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:20.000]  in a secret bunker but it's admitted it's not
[2:19:20.000 --> 2:19:22.000]  secret now we have
[2:19:22.000 --> 2:19:24.000]  a continuing on with the globalist deep state
[2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:26.000]  trying to sabotage trump democrats at press
[2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:28.000]  conferences saying trumps a russian agent
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:30.000]  i think trump now must as he did in the
[2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:32.000]  second debate go on the offense
[2:19:32.000 --> 2:19:34.000]  or they are going to come after
[2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:36.000]  him and then probably just kill him and
[2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:38.000]  just like they did jfk go ahead
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:40.000]  yeah alex
[2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:42.000]  people need to realize the trump
[2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:44.000]  movement is in a life or death struggle
[2:19:44.000 --> 2:19:46.000]  against the globalist and the globalist
[2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:48.000]  you see there's this vast complex
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:50.000]  array this vast web of laws
[2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:52.000]  for what government officials can do and can't
[2:19:52.000 --> 2:19:54.000]  do now in the past they've been very
[2:19:54.000 --> 2:19:56.000]  selectively enforced like when obama
[2:19:56.000 --> 2:19:58.000]  breaks broke laws you know they didn't
[2:19:58.000 --> 2:20:00.000]  really care but now then trump and his team
[2:20:00.000 --> 2:20:02.000]  are in they're going to use these laws as
[2:20:02.000 --> 2:20:04.000]  weapons to go after you know flinn is
[2:20:04.000 --> 2:20:06.000]  just the first that's just the beginning
[2:20:06.000 --> 2:20:08.000]  and they're immediately going to go on to the
[2:20:08.000 --> 2:20:10.000]  next targets and they're going to try to take
[2:20:10.000 --> 2:20:12.000]  out whoever they can whether it's trumps family
[2:20:12.000 --> 2:20:14.000]  members of the administration it's war
[2:20:14.000 --> 2:20:16.000]  and they've declared war on the trump
[2:20:16.000 --> 2:20:18.000]  administration and barack obama is very
[2:20:18.000 --> 2:20:20.000]  very involved in all this you know
[2:20:20.000 --> 2:20:22.000]  most ex presidents when they leave
[2:20:22.000 --> 2:20:24.000]  the white house traditionally they
[2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:26.000]  they've gone back to wherever they
[2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:28.000]  they originally came from and they build
[2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:30.000]  a library and they do oil painting whatever
[2:20:30.000 --> 2:20:32.000]  they do but barack obama
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:34.000]  instead he's decided he is going to stay
[2:20:34.000 --> 2:20:36.000]  in washington dc in fact he's
[2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:38.000]  established a new residence some are
[2:20:38.000 --> 2:20:40.000]  calling it a compound about
[2:20:40.000 --> 2:20:42.000]  two miles from the white house
[2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:44.000]  and from there he's actually
[2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:46.000]  directing what is being called an army
[2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:48.000]  an army of volunteers
[2:20:48.000 --> 2:20:50.000]  through an organization known
[2:20:50.000 --> 2:20:52.000]  as organizing for action
[2:20:52.000 --> 2:20:54.000]  it was the organization that
[2:20:54.000 --> 2:20:56.000]  originally started as his
[2:20:56.000 --> 2:20:58.000]  original presidential campaign then his
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:00.000]  re-election campaign we need a civilian
[2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:02.000]  force just as strong just as big as our military
[2:21:02.000 --> 2:21:04.000]  he's creating a brown shirt literal
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:06.000]  nazi brown shirt
[2:21:06.000 --> 2:21:08.000]  outside of government paramilitary
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:10.000]  group of guns
[2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  oh he is and since 2013
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:14.000]  they've raised 40 million dollars
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:16.000]  and now that
[2:21:16.000 --> 2:21:18.000]  administration is over obama is bringing in
[2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:20.000]  a lot of his old cronies the people he worked
[2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:22.000]  with people who are part of the administration
[2:21:22.000 --> 2:21:24.000]  are part of his campaigns in the past
[2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:26.000]  and they're building a team and they're at the
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:28.000]  forefront of a lot of these protests so
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:30.000]  you've seen some of these protests that
[2:21:30.000 --> 2:21:32.000]  whether at the airports to protest the
[2:21:32.000 --> 2:21:34.000]  immigration which some of them
[2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:36.000]  basically turned into riots that was
[2:21:36.000 --> 2:21:38.000]  organizing for action involved in a lot
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:40.000]  of those or at a lot of these town halls
[2:21:40.000 --> 2:21:42.000]  where people are going crazy because of
[2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:44.000]  there it's organizing for action
[2:21:44.000 --> 2:21:46.000]  and now we know because of wiki leaks
[2:21:46.000 --> 2:21:48.000]  all of it what Trump was saying was true
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:50.000]  it's like send women in get them to beat
[2:21:50.000 --> 2:21:52.000]  people up get them attacked and it's just
[2:21:52.000 --> 2:21:54.000]  this crazy power tripping nazi
[2:21:54.000 --> 2:21:56.000]  collaborator fruit ball that still
[2:21:56.000 --> 2:21:58.000]  admittedly is the center of all of it i mean
[2:21:58.000 --> 2:22:00.000]  good god
[2:22:00.000 --> 2:22:02.000]  yeah a lot of people have been talking about
[2:22:02.000 --> 2:22:04.000]  George Soros funding and organizing
[2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:06.000]  these protesters but organizing for action
[2:22:06.000 --> 2:22:08.000]  is really key they're really central to all this
[2:22:08.000 --> 2:22:10.000]  in fact if you go to the official website
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:12.000]  organizing for action right on the
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:14.000]  on the main page in the background is a huge
[2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:16.000]  picture of Barack Obama this is Barack
[2:22:16.000 --> 2:22:18.000]  Obama's organization like i said more than
[2:22:18.000 --> 2:22:20.000]  30,000 members across the united states
[2:22:20.000 --> 2:22:22.000]  and they they claim to have
[2:22:22.000 --> 2:22:24.000]  250 national chapters around the
[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:26.000]  country and Barack Obama's
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  going to be guiding and directing this
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:30.000]  organization from his compound
[2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:32.000]  less than two miles from the White House
[2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:34.000]  where he's building a giant brick
[2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:36.000]  wall around the compound
[2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:38.000]  to keep people out which is kind of ironic
[2:22:38.000 --> 2:22:40.000]  and he's saying join us
[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:42.000]  join us we fight
[2:22:42.000 --> 2:22:44.000]  i want to get more into this but this is
[2:22:44.000 --> 2:22:46.000]  all just part of a larger operation
[2:22:46.000 --> 2:22:48.000]  the state department is
[2:22:48.000 --> 2:22:50.000]  openly working against Trump saying he's
[2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:52.000]  a russian agent with no evidence they're
[2:22:52.000 --> 2:22:54.000]  openly saying they're going to work with
[2:22:54.000 --> 2:22:56.000]  Soros and Google to stop lapin i mean
[2:22:56.000 --> 2:22:58.000]  this is so seditious i don't shoot
[2:22:58.000 --> 2:23:00.000]  my mouth off about
[2:23:00.000 --> 2:23:02.000]  arresting people and stuff but this is all
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:04.000]  foreign globalist outside corporate
[2:23:04.000 --> 2:23:06.000]  takeover i think
[2:23:06.000 --> 2:23:08.000]  the president has to just go ahead and formulate
[2:23:08.000 --> 2:23:10.000]  a plan to
[2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:12.000]  to go ahead and call for mass indictments
[2:23:12.000 --> 2:23:14.000]  to start arresting people i think it needs to go ahead
[2:23:14.000 --> 2:23:16.000]  and happen i'm serious i'm not going to wait till they kill him
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:18.000]  i'm not going to wait they're organizing overthrow
[2:23:18.000 --> 2:23:20.000]  they're saying kill him all over the niche i say
[2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:22.000]  legally with the fbi
[2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:24.000]  with our agencies
[2:23:24.000 --> 2:23:26.000]  do the research identify the people calling
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:28.000]  for sedition and murder and start
[2:23:28.000 --> 2:23:30.000]  arresting them and there's tens of thousands doing it
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:32.000]  and i say arrest every frickin one of
[2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:34.000]  them right now they want to take the gloves off
[2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:36.000]  because here's the deal chicken necks we already
[2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:38.000]  kicked your ass in the election and if you want
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:40.000]  a civil war we're going to run over you as well
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:42.000]  but i don't want to go there i have a family
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:44.000]  and the idiots
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:46.000]  that are going along with this are the biggest
[2:23:46.000 --> 2:23:48.000]  bunch of dumbasses i've ever seen
[2:23:48.000 --> 2:23:50.000]  now as for john mccain and lindsay
[2:23:50.000 --> 2:23:52.000]  graham and all these other perverts they got so much dirt on them
[2:23:52.000 --> 2:23:54.000]  that that's why they do what they do
[2:23:54.000 --> 2:23:56.000]  but i gotta tell you
[2:23:56.000 --> 2:23:58.000]  we gotta start moving and acting right now
[2:23:58.000 --> 2:24:00.000]  i happen to know for over a week
[2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:02.000]  and now it's in the news and i'm sick
[2:24:02.000 --> 2:24:04.000]  of sitting here and waiting till it's in the news
[2:24:04.000 --> 2:24:06.000]  with all my sources but i got to do it
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:08.000]  they're trying to get rid
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:10.000]  of his head of security he's had for decades
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:12.000]  keith schiller i'm gonna
[2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  learn more today when i get off here about it
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:16.000]  and he's been told shut up while they run him out
[2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:18.000]  and get rid of all the private security he brought in
[2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:20.000]  bunch of top military people
[2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  i mean it's just
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:24.000]  insane and they know
[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  there's moves to kill the president every day
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:28.000]  there were hundreds that got foiled with obama
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:30.000]  but they shut those down because you don't promote those
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:32.000]  i mean
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:34.000]  i'm just gonna be quiet at this point
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:36.000]  look they're already trying to kill trumps the issue
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:38.000]  and they're making a move
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  and the cowards in the white house
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:42.000]  like previs and spicer
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:44.000]  they are crapping their pants
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:46.000]  well you shouldn't have signed up for men's work
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:48.000]  and boys you yellow bellies
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:50.000]  get the hell out of there
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:52.000]  there's men that are ready to stand with the president
[2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:54.000]  and restore this republic
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  and i'm about to shoot my mouth off
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:24:58.000]  i don't usually talk like this but i gotta tell you
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:00.000]  schneider i'm starting to get really pissed off
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:02.000]  yeah
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:04.000]  people need to understand this is a life or death struggle
[2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:06.000]  we've got a cold war going on inside
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:08.000]  the u.s. government right now
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:10.000]  and nothing like we've ever seen because
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:12.000]  what we've got we've got donald trump in there
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  and he's basically a beach head
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:16.000]  you know we haven't won the battle he's just a
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  beach head but we've got this entire
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:20.000]  government bureaucracy
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:22.000]  which for decades has been filled up with people
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:24.000]  that are loyal to barack obama
[2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:26.000]  or bush or but basically
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  little patients with chips on their shoulder
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  trained to hate america this is a fifth
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:32.000]  column of trash
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  yeah and so donald trump needs to do a house
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:36.000]  cleaning basically of the entire u.s.
[2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  government which is i mean when
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  all the bureaucracies that's going to take a
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  long time and again he tried to leave some
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:44.000]  in so they could run things but they're just sabotaging
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:46.000]  they're an open and i know he wants to look strong
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:48.000]  so he can't say for the first
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:50.000]  time since the civil war agencies
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  are an open revolt but they are
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:54.000]  they're announcing it they're openly
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:56.000]  press conferences saying remove him right
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:25:58.000]  now they could try to kill him within days
[2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:00.000]  i can feel it
[2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  that have been coming out it's these
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:04.000]  globalist sympathizers
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  that are still inside the government that
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:08.000]  are the source of the leaks they're
[2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:10.000]  openly trying to sabotage
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:12.000]  trump from the inside and so they've
[2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:14.000]  all got to go but what happens every time trump
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:16.000]  gets rid of some people the mainstream media
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:18.000]  cries and whines and says oh you're at all
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:20.000]  of them
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:22.000]  yeah these list of people signing letters against trump that's a list who to fire right there
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:24.000]  oh it absolutely is
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  so donald trump
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:28.000]  basically needs to clean out
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:30.000]  the certainly the top levels of
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:32.000]  every single government agency
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:34.000]  you know but but and then he's
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:36.000]  got to replace that and so that's going to
[2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  impede really the the functioning
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:40.000]  of the government potentially but it's really
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:42.000]  what needs to happen we've got to have a total
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:44.000]  and complete house cleaning because as long
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:46.000]  as those people are there they're going to be actively
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  committing war
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:50.000]  and waging war against the trump administration
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:52.000]  and trying to sabotage
[2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:54.000]  and trying to do whatever they can
[2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:56.000]  to hurt trump i don't know how people even
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:26:58.000]  sleep now because i've just always enjoyed my sleep
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  i work hard but i sleep really good i can't
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:02.000]  even sleep now i've even stopped drinking
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:04.000]  coffee very much because i just can't handle it
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:06.000]  i mean it's just like you can see
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  it you can feel it and then
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:10.000]  it trumps doing so much good stuff
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:12.000]  and then the fake right wing is all
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  working against him and the fake left
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:16.000]  wing and and like oh he's golden sacks
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:18.000]  when golden sacks is openly against him
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:20.000]  and he's destroying their whole agenda
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:22.000]  and then he's doing all these good things that bring
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:24.000]  jobs back it's just unprecedented
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:28.000]  oh it really is but unfortunately
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  i'm seeing a lot of complacency
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:32.000]  on the right among trump supporters
[2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:34.000]  because they think we won the election
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:36.000]  and so they think oh everything's been accomplished
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:38.000]  but really nothing's been accomplished the promise
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:40.000]  of trump the promise of the future
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:42.000]  depends on what happens with the battles moving
[2:27:42.000 --> 2:27:44.000]  forward meanwhile on the left
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  the complacency on the left is gone
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  they were complacent before the election because
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:50.000]  they thought oh hillary clinton is going to win
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  it's going to be an easy victory no problem trumps
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:54.000]  that's why we got elected roger stone said
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:27:56.000]  why aren't you celebrating and i just said
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:27:58.000]  if they to put hillary in their system would have been
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:28:00.000]  totally destroyed within four day years but she might
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  have started nuclear war so the right thing to do
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:04.000]  was to put trump in but now the real war
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:06.000]  is just about to begin and man this is
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  the big one and again i wish
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:10.000]  the enemy wasn't so evil it wouldn't be so
[2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:12.000]  bad and i wouldn't fight them so hard
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:14.000]  i like my whole soul is like these

[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:31.000]  where my dad teaching Sunday school to
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  adults with that stuff when I was like

[2:35:44.000 --> 2:35:50.000]  and praying with them and then it's all
[2:35:50.000 --> 2:35:52.000]  just happened and it was because there
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:54.000]  were people in intelligence agencies back
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:35:56.000]  then that were briefed on the plan and
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:35:58.000]  they were like this sounds really horrible
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:07.000]  it's just insane it's totally insane

[2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:16.000]  gotta tell you the economic collapse blog

[2:36:17.000 --> 2:36:19.000]  knowing he's out there because he really
[2:36:19.000 --> 2:36:21.000]  condenses a lot of info he also has
[2:36:21.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  really good analysis it's not fear
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:25.000]  monitoring but spot on he's also an
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:33.000]  author like I need to read that but the
[2:36:33.000 --> 2:36:36.000]  point is is that before we go back to him

[2:36:40.000 --> 2:36:41.000]  plug Twitter times an hour and all of a

[2:36:42.000 --> 2:36:44.000]  but then I stopped plugging because I
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:45.000]  just I'm not really worried about money
[2:36:45.000 --> 2:36:47.000]  but I need the money I need to hire a

[2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:49.000]  aggressive I need to go to the next
[2:36:49.000 --> 2:36:51.000]  level every time we grow we just get
[2:36:51.000 --> 2:36:54.000]  more powerful and I don't want the power
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:36:56.000]  I want to defeat the globalist I want to
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:37:00.000]  run them over and so I just I need a
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:02.000]  lot of money and I sell great products
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:05.000]  water filters air filters nutraceuticals
[2:37:05.000 --> 2:37:07.000]  great toothpaste that nobody else has got
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:09.000]  with colloidal silver and iodine in it
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  we get the biggest manufacturer of
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:12.000]  organic toothpaste in the country everybody
[2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:15.000]  knows their name and they have a brand
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:16.000]  name but it's actually another company
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:18.000]  makes the toothpaste the owner company
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:20.000]  and when you get a private label you
[2:37:20.000 --> 2:37:21.000]  obviously don't see you can't see the
[2:37:21.000 --> 2:37:22.000]  name of the company but it's the big
[2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:24.000]  name it's high quality and they
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:27.000]  proprietary make it for us and they
[2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:28.000]  really like the formula effect I'm in
[2:37:28.000 --> 2:37:30.000]  talks I need to get on their subject
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:32.000]  with actually under their name putting
[2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:34.000]  it out in stores they're like it's funny
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:35.000]  they want to actually work with us and
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:37.000]  don't want to even steal our our idea I
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:38.000]  guess they want me to brand it have you
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:40.000]  get it in stores point is this is the
[2:37:40.000 --> 2:37:41.000]  one product we're going to probably put
[2:37:41.000 --> 2:37:43.000]  in stores I mean my dad made the label
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:45.000]  himself you want to do the whole project
[2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:46.000]  as I think people actually like the
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:48.000]  cheesy label I'm not putting my dad down
[2:37:48.000 --> 2:37:49.000]  looks like I made it or something I'm
[2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:51.000]  not a good Photoshop guy but my dad
[2:37:51.000 --> 2:37:53.000]  David Jones did this whole thing start to
[2:37:53.000 --> 2:37:56.000]  finish and so it's a big hit it doesn't
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:37:58.000]  really make us a lot of money because
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:37:59.000]  you'll make money on toothpaste but it's
[2:37:59.000 --> 2:38:00.000]  a great product for folks to learn about
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:02.000]  our other products and how good they are

[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:21.000]  4.8 stars unprecedented five stars you

[2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:25.000]  healthy oral hygiene outstanding product
[2:38:25.000 --> 2:38:28.000]  good move to a new product I would buy
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:30.000]  this again game changed I mean it really
[2:38:30.000 --> 2:38:33.000]  is the best concentrated toothpaste
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:34.000]  out there doesn't have the fillers
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:36.000]  remember toothpaste you know I had
[2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:37.000]  fluoride in it used to work better
[2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:39.000]  because it was real thick and would
[2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:40.000]  barely come out of the tubes they were
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:41.000]  giving you a lot of product in there
[2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:43.000]  remember that old fashion toothpaste
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  it's all like real light now and kind of
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  just comes out even if it's organic
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:49.000]  because it's fillers there's not fillers
[2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:52.000]  in this and quite frankly it's kind of
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:54.000]  strong it's almost I can handle a lot
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:55.000]  it's kind of strong for me because it's
[2:38:55.000 --> 2:38:58.000]  real good we got bubblegum coming out
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:01.000]  I told my dad I said it's your project
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:03.000]  but why bubblegum why don't we just call
[2:39:03.000 --> 2:39:06.000]  it light or something you know good for
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:08.000]  kids but it says kids formula but quite
[2:39:08.000 --> 2:39:10.000]  frankly I might do the bubblegum sometimes
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:13.000]  and I'm not the type of guy that can't
[2:39:13.000 --> 2:39:15.000]  handle strong toothpaste I mean my dad
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:17.000]  really came up with something here so
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:20.000]  it's concentrated it's strong it's got a
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:22.000]  lot of tea tree oil and peppermint in it too

[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:36.000]  read your book I didn't get shown to plug
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:38.000]  your book but I want to read it before I
[2:39:38.000 --> 2:39:39.000]  have you on about it but I didn't even
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:40.000]  know you were an author on top of it so
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:42.000]  let's talk about that in a minute but
[2:39:42.000 --> 2:39:44.000]  first kind of take over because I'm all
[2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:46.000]  wound up here today what would you call
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:49.000]  the climate we're in because I mean it's
[2:39:49.000 --> 2:39:51.000]  so surreal to be immersed in the facts
[2:39:51.000 --> 2:39:53.000]  and know what's really going on versus
[2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:54.000]  what we're told and to see Democrats
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:56.000]  saying it's much worse there's Russians
[2:39:56.000 --> 2:39:58.000]  all in the White House Trump's going down
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:01.000]  we're bringing him down it's on Firestorm
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:03.000]  his national security advisor talked to
[2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:05.000]  the Russian ambassador and they mentioned
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:06.000]  sanctions he said yeah the president will
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:08.000]  talk to you about that and they admit
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:10.000]  that's totally normal but it doesn't
[2:40:10.000 --> 2:40:12.000]  matter Firestorm everything and then
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:14.000]  Trump's removed him and I mean this
[2:40:14.000 --> 2:40:16.000]  seems like cutting yourself and jumping
[2:40:16.000 --> 2:40:19.000]  in like shark infested waters go ahead
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:22.000]  yeah Alex what we're seeing is kind of
[2:40:22.000 --> 2:40:24.000]  the blossoming of a political movement
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:26.000]  and for whatever reason history or
[2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:28.000]  Providence has chosen Donald Trump to be
[2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:30.000]  at the head of this anti-globalist
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:33.000]  movement and this battle is going to
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:36.000]  take a period of time to play out and
[2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:38.000]  if this movement if Donald Trump loses
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:40.000]  if this movement loses we're going to
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:42.000]  lose everything ultimately because the
[2:40:42.000 --> 2:40:44.000]  globalist we're going to have FEMA camps
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:46.000]  we're going to have you know a socialism
[2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:48.000]  we're going to have everything
[2:40:48.000 --> 2:40:50.000]  they announced the camps they've announced
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:52.000]  they want to shut down the press
[2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:54.000]  they've announced they want to arrest me
[2:40:54.000 --> 2:40:56.000]  I mean it's real sorry go ahead
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:40:58.000]  yeah that's why the success of
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:00.000]  Trump is so critical because if he loses
[2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:02.000]  if his movement is defeated if this
[2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:04.000]  movement is defeated and the globalist
[2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:06.000]  win well they're just going to go all the
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:08.000]  way and we're going to lose everything
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:10.000]  but if we win I'm going to go away
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:12.000]  back we could get our country back we
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  could get the United States back we could
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:16.000]  get America back so this is
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:18.000]  literally life or death
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:20.000]  future or no future by the way
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:22.000]  they've called it death battle their own
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:24.000]  people say we're in a death battle and they
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:26.000]  even say with America they even chant
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:28.000]  USA KKK
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:30.000]  go away these are literal fifth column
[2:41:30.000 --> 2:41:32.000]  brainwash idiots
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:34.000]  who have no idea what North Korea is like
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:36.000]  sorry oh and I don't even know if
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:38.000]  Donald Trump fully comprehends the full
[2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:40.000]  scope of this you know he just
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:42.000]  says oh we need have one nation we need
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:44.000]  to have borders but when he talks about
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:46.000]  borders or building a wall or immigration
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:48.000]  bands what he's saying is we want to
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:50.000]  have a nation we want to have borders
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:52.000]  that means something and that's totally
[2:41:52.000 --> 2:41:54.000]  opposed to the globalist who want a world
[2:41:54.000 --> 2:41:56.000]  without borders that's why they're so upset
[2:41:56.000 --> 2:41:58.000]  because it goes directly against their agenda
[2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:00.000]  or when Donald Trump says I'm opposed to
[2:42:00.000 --> 2:42:02.000]  free trade I'm opposed to not
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:04.000]  necessarily free trade but these these
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:06.000]  kind of locking and interweaving globalist
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:08.000]  trade agreements
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:10.000]  that are trying to basically merge
[2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:12.000]  the whole global economy
[2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:14.000]  into a one world economy when
[2:42:14.000 --> 2:42:16.000]  Donald Trump says I'm opposed to those agreements
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:18.000]  he's directly opposing
[2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:20.000]  their agenda to bring the global
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:22.000]  economy into one or when Donald Trump
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:24.000]  says hey I'm concerned about radical
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:26.000]  Islam and the terrorism well
[2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:28.000]  you're not supposed to say anything bad about
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:30.000]  Islam because Islam is supposed
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:32.000]  to be according to the globalist part of their
[2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:34.000]  one world religion agenda
[2:42:34.000 --> 2:42:36.000]  so the globalist one a one world
[2:42:36.000 --> 2:42:38.000]  and that's key that's key
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:40.000]  people understand the Pope is saying
[2:42:40.000 --> 2:42:42.000]  nothing disgusts me more that's a quote
[2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:44.000]  than hearing about Christian roots of Europe
[2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:46.000]  that's a quote three months ago
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:48.000]  they're in the news today saying
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:50.000]  one world currency
[2:42:50.000 --> 2:42:52.000]  total control
[2:42:52.000 --> 2:42:54.000]  open borders
[2:42:54.000 --> 2:42:56.000]  it's crazy let's go back to before the break
[2:42:56.000 --> 2:42:58.000]  the break interrupts you and so did I
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:00.000]  you mentioned political everybody suddenly
[2:43:00.000 --> 2:43:02.000]  like global governments in trouble
[2:43:02.000 --> 2:43:04.000]  it was so wonderful and liberal and Trump's bad
[2:43:04.000 --> 2:43:06.000]  so they've gone from denying it to now saying
[2:43:06.000 --> 2:43:08.000]  it's anti-racist world governments loving
[2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:10.000]  when it's an
[2:43:10.000 --> 2:43:12.000]  unelected nightmare so what do you make
[2:43:12.000 --> 2:43:14.000]  of their defeat
[2:43:14.000 --> 2:43:16.000]  having to admit now globalism's real
[2:43:16.000 --> 2:43:18.000]  it's unelected it's in crisis but it's
[2:43:18.000 --> 2:43:20.000]  liberal so we should all support it go ahead
[2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:22.000]  yeah one time if you
[2:43:22.000 --> 2:43:24.000]  use the term globalists well people
[2:43:24.000 --> 2:43:26.000]  would immediately peg you as a quote unquote
[2:43:26.000 --> 2:43:28.000]  conspiracy theorist and so you've been
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:30.000]  using that term for many many years
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:32.000]  it's a term that I use but the mainstream
[2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:34.000]  media would never use that term before but now
[2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:36.000]  they're openly using the term globalist
[2:43:36.000 --> 2:43:38.000]  New York Times is opening it using
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:40.000]  the word globalist in their headlines and saying
[2:43:40.000 --> 2:43:42.000]  oh the globalist feel defeated they feel
[2:43:42.000 --> 2:43:44.000]  like their their agenda has been derailed
[2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:46.000]  and so they're they're just coming out wet
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:48.000]  right out in the open and saying this
[2:43:48.000 --> 2:43:50.000]  and they're trying to position themselves as the good guys
[2:43:50.000 --> 2:43:52.000]  as opposed to the Trump oh Trump
[2:43:52.000 --> 2:43:54.000]  and his people they're against globalism
[2:43:54.000 --> 2:43:56.000]  they're the bad guys they need to be defeated
[2:43:56.000 --> 2:43:58.000]  so now instead of a a a conflict
[2:43:58.000 --> 2:44:00.000]  that was kind of underneath
[2:44:00.000 --> 2:44:02.000]  and hidden now it's just way out
[2:44:02.000 --> 2:44:04.000]  in the open now the mainstream media is just getting
[2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:06.000]  all on board oh globalism is good we need
[2:44:06.000 --> 2:44:08.000]  globalism and so it's it's come
[2:44:08.000 --> 2:44:10.000]  to the surface it's right out in front
[2:44:10.000 --> 2:44:12.000]  and and and you know and people
[2:44:12.000 --> 2:44:14.000]  need to realize that this is moving forward
[2:44:14.000 --> 2:44:16.000]  and Snyder describe what globalism is it's
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:18.000]  totally corporate world government above the law
[2:44:18.000 --> 2:44:20.000]  tax exempt ruling us with
[2:44:20.000 --> 2:44:22.000]  weird creepies like Bill Clinton running
[2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:24.000]  oh yeah and in this
[2:44:24.000 --> 2:44:26.000]  article in the New York Times they even said Bill Clinton's
[2:44:26.000 --> 2:44:28.000]  one of the biggest globalists of all which is very
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:30.000]  true but I was shocked to see it in the New York Times
[2:44:30.000 --> 2:44:32.000]  but they're not even trying to hide
[2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:34.000]  it anymore and so they're going to use
[2:44:34.000 --> 2:44:36.000]  political ends and the law
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:38.000]  on the courts to try to fight Trump they're
[2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:40.000]  also potentially going to use the economy
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:42.000]  and so people need to be watching
[2:44:42.000 --> 2:44:44.000]  the economy because they that's my
[2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:46.000]  next issue you're so on target
[2:44:46.000 --> 2:44:48.000]  we've seen Bloomberg
[2:44:48.000 --> 2:44:50.000]  Goldman Sachs all the big banks
[2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:52.000]  saying dump your stocks the Trump recovery
[2:44:52.000 --> 2:44:54.000]  is over the public should be
[2:44:54.000 --> 2:44:56.000]  so angry at that they're openly trying
[2:44:56.000 --> 2:44:58.000]  to plunge the economy to sabotage Trump
[2:44:58.000 --> 2:45:00.000]  I've never seen him so naked
[2:45:00.000 --> 2:45:02.000]  like we're idiots admitting
[2:45:02.000 --> 2:45:04.000]  they want to sabotage it to hurting
[2:45:04.000 --> 2:45:06.000]  talk about that
[2:45:06.000 --> 2:45:08.000]  yeah at some point they're going to pull a trigger
[2:45:08.000 --> 2:45:10.000]  you know that the elite one thing to have is
[2:45:10.000 --> 2:45:12.000]  lots and lots of money lots of financial resources
[2:45:12.000 --> 2:45:14.000]  and so they have the kind of resources
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:16.000]  that can do an incredible amount of damage to
[2:45:16.000 --> 2:45:18.000]  the financial system into the economy
[2:45:18.000 --> 2:45:20.000]  and so you know the people out there who are
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:22.000]  assuming hey we're going to go through the next four years
[2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:24.000]  and just because Trump is president we're not going to
[2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:26.000]  have any economic problems I think
[2:45:26.000 --> 2:45:28.000]  that they're being maybe naive because
[2:45:28.000 --> 2:45:30.000]  ultimately you know how American voters
[2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:32.000]  vote is primarily
[2:45:32.000 --> 2:45:34.000]  due to their pocket books how the economy
[2:45:34.000 --> 2:45:36.000]  is doing and so the global elite
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:38.000]  if they want to hurt Trump's re-election
[2:45:38.000 --> 2:45:40.000]  chances for 2020 they will
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:42.000]  want to crush the economy
[2:45:42.000 --> 2:45:44.000]  make things look terrible and so
[2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:46.000]  that a globalist candidate can win next time
[2:45:46.000 --> 2:45:48.000]  and so in my opinion I've been writing
[2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:50.000]  about this and how and the signs that
[2:45:50.000 --> 2:45:52.000]  we are already potentially moving into
[2:45:52.000 --> 2:45:54.000]  a recession but potentially
[2:45:54.000 --> 2:45:56.000]  what Trump and Trump supporters should want
[2:45:56.000 --> 2:45:58.000]  if a recession is coming
[2:45:58.000 --> 2:46:00.000]  what we should want is for it to start
[2:46:00.000 --> 2:46:02.000]  as soon as possible I know that sounds a
[2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:04.000]  little strange but follow me start as
[2:46:04.000 --> 2:46:06.000]  soon as possible so it can end as soon as
[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:08.000]  possible if you remember back during the Reagan years
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:10.000]  you know when Reagan came in
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:12.000]  a horrible recession started
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:14.000]  very early in his presidency but then there was
[2:46:14.000 --> 2:46:16.000]  a recovery and then they had those commercials
[2:46:16.000 --> 2:46:18.000]  during Reagan's re-election campaign
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:20.000]  it's morning in America again
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:22.000]  and he rode that momentum to an easy victory
[2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:24.000]  so if the coming recession starts
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:26.000]  quickly and then there's a recovery
[2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:28.000]  Trump could potentially ride that momentum
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:30.000]  to you know and help him in the
[2:46:30.000 --> 2:46:32.000]  2020 campaign but right now
[2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:34.000]  we're already seeing the economy start to slow down
[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:36.000]  sure what do we do as citizens and
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:38.000]  listeners and activists I have my ideas
[2:46:38.000 --> 2:46:40.000]  I'll tell you in a minute yours
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:42.000]  I want to tell the intelligence agencies
[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:44.000]  everything's surveilled we already know that the time
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:46.000]  you're talking about your own butt and do the right thing
[2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:48.000]  I mean I can say
[2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:50.000]  I clearly just as a citizen to put myself on the line
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:52.000]  here because turning yourself over to Soros
[2:46:52.000 --> 2:46:54.000]  and these vampires is just not even a
[2:46:54.000 --> 2:46:56.000]  choice we must resist this
[2:46:56.000 --> 2:46:58.000]  the criminal activities you know the
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:00.000]  information the pedophilia
[2:47:00.000 --> 2:47:02.000]  the corruption the Chinese funding
[2:47:02.000 --> 2:47:04.000]  the Democrats
[2:47:04.000 --> 2:47:06.000]  hell they're in the newspapers
[2:47:06.000 --> 2:47:08.000]  you know saying they're going to stop Trump
[2:47:08.000 --> 2:47:10.000]  we've got to get the word out on that
[2:47:10.000 --> 2:47:12.000]  you've got to leak information on criminal activity
[2:47:12.000 --> 2:47:14.000]  the war just begun
[2:47:14.000 --> 2:47:16.000]  Trump's leading our force
[2:47:16.000 --> 2:47:18.000]  on the beachhead we have a winning force
[2:47:18.000 --> 2:47:20.000]  we will win we've got to get it all on the beach
[2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:22.000]  and we've got to have the initiative and we've got to fight
[2:47:22.000 --> 2:47:24.000]  and we've got to realize we're not up against
[2:47:24.000 --> 2:47:26.000]  dumb liberal media we're up against evil people
[2:47:26.000 --> 2:47:28.000]  you see their congressmen and senators
[2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:30.000]  who seem like mentally ill are retarded
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:32.000]  that's because they're puppets but there are smart
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:34.000]  psychopaths behind them we're dealing with
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:36.000]  and we have to
[2:47:36.000 --> 2:47:38.000]  literally turn the heat up pray to God
[2:47:38.000 --> 2:47:40.000]  take action call cease me in call
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:42.000]  congress go to events have our own
[2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:44.000]  tea party event go out and confront the liberals
[2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:46.000]  trying to storm all these other events and bully people
[2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:48.000]  in the submission expose John McCain
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:50.000]  expose Lindsey Graham expose
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:52.000]  Mitch McConnell expose the speaker of the house
[2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:54.000]  who is an absolute globalist under Soros
[2:47:54.000 --> 2:47:56.000]  control federal election commission
[2:47:56.000 --> 2:47:58.000]  shows it Paul Ryan we have
[2:47:58.000 --> 2:48:00.000]  to get Trump absolutely to
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:02.000]  understand he doesn't even know
[2:48:02.000 --> 2:48:04.000]  he doesn't know how Twitter works how I hardly
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:06.000]  do but they're only letting negative tweets up at
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:08.000]  the top for him to see it they're gaming everything
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:10.000]  to isolate the president and we've got
[2:48:10.000 --> 2:48:12.000]  to just absolutely
[2:48:12.000 --> 2:48:14.000]  barrage through so that he knows
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:16.000]  that we understand what's happening because
[2:48:16.000 --> 2:48:18.000]  his instincts are all dead on still
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:20.000]  he doesn't go to mainstream media he can
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:22.000]  he goes to new media events but the again
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:24.000]  when Spicer does he
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:26.000]  goes to the globalist so we just have
[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:28.000]  to get through to the president and have
[2:48:28.000 --> 2:48:30.000]  to let him know that we understand what's happening and get through to
[2:48:30.000 --> 2:48:32.000]  everybody else and again good people
[2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:34.000]  the military police corporate
[2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:36.000]  folks everybody this is the time
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:38.000]  to sign which side you're on holy
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:40.000]  smokes here you've got
[2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:42.000]  to join with the Republic and sovereignty
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:44.000]  this is so clear this is
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:46.000]  so critical Michael Schneider
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:48.000]  yeah Alex people need to
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:50.000]  understand we're in a war but it's not a war with
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:52.000]  guns it's not a war with fists it's an
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:54.000]  information war and and
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:48:56.000]  let me give just give people an example
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:48:58.000]  let's say there was no Alex Jones
[2:48:58.000 --> 2:49:00.000]  let's say there was no info wars
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:02.000]  com would Donald Trump be president
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  today I think that's an open
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:06.000]  question because you know the support
[2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:08.000]  that you gave and the millions upon
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:10.000]  millions of people that you all reach
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:12.000]  every week you know and
[2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:14.000]  the support for Trump the president
[2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:16.000]  told me he believes it was a critical factor
[2:49:16.000 --> 2:49:18.000]  in the whole deal the point is is that
[2:49:18.000 --> 2:49:20.000]  everybody has to be the info or don't think
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:22.000]  Alex is there they could get me folks
[2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:24.000]  let's just and I don't fear for myself
[2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:26.000]  I fear for failure and these monsters
[2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:28.000]  get in control of our children go ahead
[2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:30.000]  oh yeah and so
[2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:32.000]  we all need to do what we can you know
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:34.000]  personally I'm just one person
[2:49:34.000 --> 2:49:36.000]  living in the in the middle of the mountains
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:38.000]  in the middle of nowhere up in the northwest
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:40.000]  and from my little ten years ago
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:42.000]  you hardly reach anybody and I reached 20 30
[2:49:42.000 --> 2:49:44.000]  40 million people a week you're on drugs
[2:49:44.000 --> 2:49:46.000]  you're all over everywhere all the time you're doing a great job
[2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:48.000]  yeah and that was just one
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:50.000]  person taking action not giving up trying
[2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:52.000]  to do what he could but it takes all of
[2:49:52.000 --> 2:49:54.000]  us because there's a limit to what any one of us can do
[2:49:54.000 --> 2:49:56.000]  so we but we can all be involved in
[2:49:56.000 --> 2:49:58.000]  you know people would have never heard and we can override
[2:49:58.000 --> 2:50:00.000]  their algorithms they try to cheat us they try
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:02.000]  to block us we use their platforms
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:04.000]  and spread there but we make our own
[2:50:04.000 --> 2:50:06.000]  platforms the key is hit them on every platform
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:08.000]  go ahead
[2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  then that's why they've made such a big deal of fake news
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:12.000]  because they know we're a threat they know
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:14.000]  that the power that we have now they know that
[2:50:14.000 --> 2:50:16.000]  Donald Trump never could have won the election
[2:50:16.000 --> 2:50:18.000]  without the alternative media and so
[2:50:18.000 --> 2:50:20.000]  they're said okay we've got to target fake news
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:22.000]  we've got to go after these people and try
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:24.000]  to hit them hard but that's why we need to
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:26.000]  redouble our efforts get bigger and big
[2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:28.000]  and get stronger not so we can become famous
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:30.000]  or so we can do whatever but because
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:32.000]  we so we can make more of a difference
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:34.000]  more so the pedophile network that runs
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:36.000]  everything can't keep grabbing our kids on the back yard
[2:50:36.000 --> 2:50:38.000]  yeah that's why yeah they don't go right to hell
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:40.000]  and Hillary making pizza gate story jokes
[2:50:40.000 --> 2:50:42.000]  yeah what a she was a specialist
[2:50:42.000 --> 2:50:44.000]  that representing pedophiles
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:46.000]  that were known rapists of children
[2:50:46.000 --> 2:50:48.000]  now we know who she is she's a
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:50.000]  she's a frickin Renfield man
[2:50:50.000 --> 2:50:52.000]  god I'm right I wish I didn't have
[2:50:52.000 --> 2:50:54.000]  the whole thing figured out we're gonna come right back

[2:53:58.000 --> 2:54:02.000]  we've got it man I should have talked
[2:54:02.000 --> 2:54:04.000]  more about this Orville dam in northern
[2:54:04.000 --> 2:54:07.000]  California
[2:54:13.000 --> 2:54:15.000]  I mean you look at how scary it looks
[2:54:15.000 --> 2:54:18.000]  coming down that mountainside it is just
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:21.000]  incredible when they pull back you show
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:22.000]  the footage from earlier that's not
[2:54:22.000 --> 2:54:24.000]  during the break again a lot of this is
[2:54:24.000 --> 2:54:26.000]  radio listeners were listening to us on
[2:54:26.000 --> 2:54:27.000]  the station you're like well they're
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:29.000]  talking about seeing stuff we're just
[2:54:29.000 --> 2:54:32.000]  showing you Fox News analyzing it back
[2:54:32.000 --> 2:54:35.000]  it up back about about about a minute or
[2:54:35.000 --> 2:54:38.000]  so because it showed it from far off and
[2:54:38.000 --> 2:54:40.000]  now it's eroding the mountainside and
[2:54:40.000 --> 2:54:43.000]  yeah and I mean talk about scary looking
[2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:46.000]  and again they wouldn't fix the dam they
[2:54:46.000 --> 2:54:48.000]  wouldn't upkeep it for 30 years they
[2:54:48.000 --> 2:54:51.000]  want dams destroyed folks and then they
[2:54:51.000 --> 2:54:52.000]  say of course California doesn't have
[2:54:52.000 --> 2:54:54.000]  any water people go well they were in a
[2:54:54.000 --> 2:54:56.000]  drought these those reservoirs were full
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:54:58.000]  they wouldn't let you use it for
[2:54:58.000 --> 2:54:59.000]  environmental reasons they just want to
[2:54:59.000 --> 2:55:01.000]  bankrupt everything because they're
[2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:02.000]  long-term folks they then get your
[2:55:02.000 --> 2:55:06.000]  property but I do think it's an archetypal
[2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:11.000]  or allegory parable parallel example of
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:13.000]  the human awakening to what's happening
[2:55:13.000 --> 2:55:15.000]  and seven and a half billion souls
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:17.000]  realizing what the globalists are doing
[2:55:17.000 --> 2:55:20.000]  just like Zuckerberg thought he could
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:22.000]  steal a bunch of land in Hawaii from
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:24.000]  people everybody stood up to him he's
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:26.000]  this big fake liberal it's it's like
[2:55:26.000 --> 2:55:29.000]  standing in front of rushing dam water
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:31.000]  and people call me alarmist I've always
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:34.000]  used the allegory of the dam if I live
[2:55:34.000 --> 2:55:36.000]  up on the mountainside and I've got a
[2:55:36.000 --> 2:55:38.000]  radio down to the town ten miles away
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:39.000]  and I see the dam break this happened
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:42.000]  before and I radio down and say get out
[2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:43.000]  of there get out of there water's gonna be
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:45.000]  there about ten minutes and fifty feet
[2:55:45.000 --> 2:55:47.000]  high it's gonna kill you I'm not a fear
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:49.000]  monger I'm warning people I'm doing
[2:55:49.000 --> 2:55:52.000]  something proactive and let me tell you
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:53.000]  it's flooding so bad it looks like that
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:55:55.000]  damn may break not just the spillway
[2:55:55.000 --> 2:55:58.000]  it's it's now eroding all around the
[2:55:58.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  mountainsides and I could look here's
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:02.000]  the deal I could get massive ratings we
[2:56:02.000 --> 2:56:05.000]  did live Facebook mentions covering the
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:08.000]  helicopter and drone feeds of this that
[2:56:08.000 --> 2:56:10.000]  are being shown by Noah and other groups
[2:56:10.000 --> 2:56:14.000]  but there's so much real stuff going on
[2:56:14.000 --> 2:56:15.000]  that's even bigger that even though this
[2:56:15.000 --> 2:56:17.000]  dam is dangerous and horrible and a great
[2:56:17.000 --> 2:56:19.000]  example of our infrastructure crumbling
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:21.000]  it's not that important you know covering
[2:56:21.000 --> 2:56:23.000]  that they're 12 years overdue for a
[2:56:23.000 --> 2:56:25.000]  mega quake in Southern California it'll
[2:56:25.000 --> 2:56:27.000]  be thousands of times worse than this
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:30.000]  conservatively 10,000 times worse that's
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:32.000]  really the big enchilada and again it
[2:56:32.000 --> 2:56:35.000]  shows no one cares anymore in the
[2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:37.000]  establishment they don't care if reactors
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:39.000]  are leaking Fukushima there's just this
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:42.000]  crazy narcissism where they're so obsessed
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:44.000]  with themselves they don't care and so
[2:56:44.000 --> 2:56:46.000]  downstream dams are flooding more storms
[2:56:46.000 --> 2:56:49.000]  are coming that damn looks like it's
[2:56:49.000 --> 2:56:51.000]  gonna break to me I saw some footage of
[2:56:51.000 --> 2:56:53.000]  the mountain around it coming down
[2:56:53.000 --> 2:56:56.000]  doesn't look good to me doesn't look good
[2:56:56.000 --> 2:56:59.000]  to me I tell you and folks don't even
[2:56:59.000 --> 2:57:01.000]  know how to evacuate properly let's go
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:02.000]  back to Michael Schneider Michael what
[2:57:02.000 --> 2:57:03.000]  do you think about this damn closing
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:06.000]  comments I think it's quite alarming
[2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:08.000]  because literally for years our
[2:57:08.000 --> 2:57:09.000]  infrastructure has been crumbling all
[2:57:09.000 --> 2:57:11.000]  around us and Donald Trump is right
[2:57:11.000 --> 2:57:13.000]  with his instincts to want to spend a
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:14.000]  trillion dollars on infrastructure
[2:57:14.000 --> 2:57:16.000]  because literally I mean we had all
[2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:18.000]  these great projects which were built
[2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:20.000]  in the 30s and 40s and 50s and 60s when
[2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:23.000]  America was a lot greater than it was
[2:57:23.000 --> 2:57:25.000]  today the last time was Eisenhower
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:27.000]  building stuff yeah a lot of those great
[2:57:27.000 --> 2:57:29.000]  infrastructure projects are now crumbling
[2:57:29.000 --> 2:57:30.000]  they haven't been replaced they haven't
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:33.000]  been up and so you know Governor Jerry
[2:57:33.000 --> 2:57:35.000]  Brown of California had a list of a
[2:57:35.000 --> 2:57:37.000]  hundred billion dollars of projects that
[2:57:37.000 --> 2:57:39.000]  needed to be done in California and the
[2:57:39.000 --> 2:57:41.000]  Oroville Dam wasn't even on his list you
[2:57:41.000 --> 2:57:43.000]  know that's how bad things have done I
[2:57:43.000 --> 2:57:44.000]  mean if you go into many of our airports
[2:57:44.000 --> 2:57:46.000]  today you know they some of them look
[2:57:46.000 --> 2:57:48.000]  like third world countries like you're
[2:57:48.000 --> 2:57:50.000]  going to say that and they go oh he's
[2:57:50.000 --> 2:57:53.000]  anti-America no he knows infrastructure
[2:57:53.000 --> 2:57:55.000]  spending actually is what gives people
[2:57:55.000 --> 2:57:58.000]  jobs and creates a country it's like
[2:57:58.000 --> 2:58:01.000]  renovating a house it ups the value it
[2:58:01.000 --> 2:58:03.000]  absolutely does and it's one of the
[2:58:03.000 --> 2:58:05.000]  legitimate functions of a federal
[2:58:05.000 --> 2:58:07.000]  government or state government is to
[2:58:07.000 --> 2:58:09.000]  build infrastructure to do roads and
[2:58:09.000 --> 2:58:11.000]  airports and dams and these kind of
[2:58:11.000 --> 2:58:13.000]  things but you know it's been neglected
[2:58:13.000 --> 2:58:15.000]  for so long and it's been in a crisis
[2:58:15.000 --> 2:58:17.000]  for years there's been report after
[2:58:17.000 --> 2:58:19.000]  report about the crisis now the thing
[2:58:19.000 --> 2:58:21.000]  that Trump's facing it's great to want to
[2:58:21.000 --> 2:58:23.000]  spend all that money on infrastructure
[2:58:23.000 --> 2:58:25.000]  but unfortunately where is the money
[2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:27.000]  going to come from because under Obama
[2:58:27.000 --> 2:58:29.000]  of course the national debt went from
[2:58:29.000 --> 2:58:31.000]  10.6 trillion to 20 trillion dollars I
[2:58:31.000 --> 2:58:33.000]  mean every and it's going up
[2:58:33.000 --> 2:58:35.000]  more than a trillion dollars a year
[2:58:35.000 --> 2:58:37.000]  it's insane you're really an expert on that
[2:58:37.000 --> 2:58:39.000]  we should have you back soon thank you so much
[2:58:39.000 --> 2:58:41.000]  I'm going to introduce Watson and T-minus
[2:58:41.000 --> 2:58:43.000]  70 seconds as we go into the fourth hour
[2:58:43.000 --> 2:58:45.000]  stay with us I'm Alex Jones spread the link
[2:58:45.000 --> 2:58:47.000]  you're trying to censor us I mean we're
[2:58:47.000 --> 2:58:49.000]  the new counterculture we're actually
[2:58:49.000 --> 2:58:51.000]  fighting for something the military
[2:58:51.000 --> 2:58:53.000]  industrial complex is trying to sabotage
[2:58:53.000 --> 2:58:55.000]  Donald Trump last night national
[2:58:55.000 --> 2:58:57.000]  security advisor Michael Flynn
[2:58:57.000 --> 2:58:59.000]  officially resigned this following reports
[2:58:59.000 --> 2:59:01.000]  that he had misled officials
[2:59:01.000 --> 2:59:03.000]  about his contacts with Russia
[2:59:03.000 --> 2:59:05.000]  meanwhile the establishment media
[2:59:05.000 --> 2:59:07.000]  says this validates their conspiracy
[2:59:07.000 --> 2:59:09.000]  theory that Russia
[2:59:09.000 --> 2:59:11.000]  hacked the US elections
[2:59:11.000 --> 2:59:13.000]  they're also claiming that general Flynn's
[2:59:13.000 --> 2:59:15.000]  conversation with the Russian ambassador
[2:59:15.000 --> 2:59:17.000]  is a violation of the Logan act
[2:59:17.000 --> 2:59:19.000]  but wait a minute where was the mainstream
[2:59:19.000 --> 2:59:21.000]  media during the Bilderberg
[2:59:21.000 --> 2:59:23.000]  conferences you know the secret
[2:59:23.000 --> 2:59:25.000]  group of global elitists
[2:59:25.000 --> 2:59:27.000]  ignored by the mainstream media as they
[2:59:27.000 --> 2:59:29.000]  privately meet each year
[2:59:29.000 --> 2:59:31.000]  to plan and coordinate global
[2:59:31.000 --> 2:59:33.000]  policy look the establishment
[2:59:33.000 --> 2:59:35.000]  wants to purge the Trump
[2:59:35.000 --> 2:59:37.000]  administration and replace them
[2:59:37.000 --> 2:59:39.000]  with compromised Washington
[2:59:39.000 --> 2:59:41.000]  insiders and globalists in other
[2:59:41.000 --> 2:59:43.000]  words they are trying to refill
[2:59:43.000 --> 2:59:45.000]  the swamp and you can learn more

[2:59:53.000 --> 2:59:57.000]  show
[3:00:23.000 --> 3:00:25.000]  they've had multiple press conferences
[3:00:25.000 --> 3:00:27.000]  every channel says
[3:00:27.000 --> 3:00:29.000]  fires storm
[3:00:29.000 --> 3:00:31.000]  Trump's a Russian agent
[3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:33.000]  Lapin's a Russian agent
[3:00:33.000 --> 3:00:35.000]  Parage is a Russian agent
[3:00:35.000 --> 3:00:37.000]  you don't want big mega banks
[3:00:37.000 --> 3:00:39.000]  raping you and your family
[3:00:39.000 --> 3:00:41.000]  if you want to have lower taxes
[3:00:41.000 --> 3:00:43.000]  if you want sovereignty if you don't want
[3:00:43.000 --> 3:00:45.000]  5 million jihadis
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:47.000]  shipped into your country
[3:00:47.000 --> 3:00:49.000]  80% of military aged men
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:00:51.000]  raping your women in the street
[3:00:51.000 --> 3:00:53.000]  then you're a Russian agent
[3:00:53.000 --> 3:00:55.000]  well if that's true then
[3:00:55.000 --> 3:00:57.000]  put the Russians in charge
[3:00:57.000 --> 3:00:59.000]  but of course it's not
[3:00:59.000 --> 3:01:01.000]  the Russians
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:03.000]  have enjoyed 85 years
[3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:05.000]  of globalist gang raping
[3:01:05.000 --> 3:01:07.000]  and now they've broken away
[3:01:07.000 --> 3:01:09.000]  so the only truth is
[3:01:09.000 --> 3:01:11.000]  Russia was the trailblazer out of the
[3:01:11.000 --> 3:01:13.000]  new world order are they perfect hell no
[3:01:13.000 --> 3:01:15.000]  are we? No
[3:01:15.000 --> 3:01:17.000]  the point is all over the world
[3:01:17.000 --> 3:01:19.000]  from Brazil to Spain
[3:01:19.000 --> 3:01:21.000]  the people went out from under foreign banks
[3:01:21.000 --> 3:01:23.000]  ripping them off
[3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:25.000]  Paul Watson
[3:01:25.000 --> 3:01:27.000]  let's not toot your horn
[3:01:27.000 --> 3:01:29.000]  but I think our audience of folks should recognize
[3:01:29.000 --> 3:01:31.000]  that you probably undoubtedly
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:33.000]  bragging it's true more than Milo
[3:01:33.000 --> 3:01:35.000]  more than anybody else more than
[3:01:35.000 --> 3:01:37.000]  myself now I reach more people every week with your videos
[3:01:37.000 --> 3:01:39.000]  I did the math
[3:01:39.000 --> 3:01:41.000]  The New York Times is doing a story on it and I'm going to send them the numbers today
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:43.000]  you my friend have got about
[3:01:43.000 --> 3:01:45.000]  25 million views a week
[3:01:45.000 --> 3:01:47.000]  every week on average not to mention your articles
[3:01:47.000 --> 3:01:49.000]  so I salute your dedication
[3:01:49.000 --> 3:01:51.000]  in 16 years working with me
[3:01:51.000 --> 3:01:53.000]  and the circle is now complete
[3:01:53.000 --> 3:01:55.000]  so when I first met you
[3:01:55.000 --> 3:01:57.000]  I was the master now you are the master
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:01:59.000]  tell us what's coming up
[3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:01.000]  well we're going to talk about this general
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:03.000]  Flynn thing of course Alex because
[3:02:03.000 --> 3:02:05.000]  you mentioned the mainstream media now
[3:02:05.000 --> 3:02:07.000]  with the New York Times interviewing you
[3:02:07.000 --> 3:02:09.000]  they're trying to do profile
[3:02:09.000 --> 3:02:11.000]  pieces on me they're trying to co-opt us
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:13.000]  and it's because as it ties into
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:15.000]  this general Flynn thing which
[3:02:15.000 --> 3:02:17.000]  I don't know if you've mentioned this but
[3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:19.000]  days after
[3:02:19.000 --> 3:02:21.000]  Trump won days after
[3:02:21.000 --> 3:02:23.000]  CNN did a big hit piece about
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:25.000]  how general Flynn's son
[3:02:25.000 --> 3:02:27.000]  was a massive fan of you
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:29.000]  listen to your radio show
[3:02:29.000 --> 3:02:31.000]  put hashtag info wars in all his tweets
[3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:33.000]  retweeted me
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:35.000]  they wrote a whole
[3:02:35.000 --> 3:02:37.000]  they only knew the rest of the story they'd really be upset
[3:02:37.000 --> 3:02:39.000]  yeah and that's because his son
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:41.000]  you know the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:43.000]  general Flynn is a patriot
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:45.000]  he's anti-New World Order
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:47.000]  this is part of the deep state
[3:02:47.000 --> 3:02:49.000]  the military industrial complex
[3:02:49.000 --> 3:02:51.000]  trying to sabotage Trump
[3:02:51.000 --> 3:02:53.000]  basically Flynn testified
[3:02:53.000 --> 3:02:55.000]  and closed Congress to Walter Jones
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:02:57.000]  everybody about our government was running al-Qaeda
[3:02:57.000 --> 3:02:59.000]  that's why they hate him
[3:02:59.000 --> 3:03:01.000]  and the guy's a total patriot with balls the size
[3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:03.000]  of Nebraska and they just destroyed him
[3:03:03.000 --> 3:03:05.000]  because they can't have a real man around go ahead
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  sorry
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:09.000]  yeah he was enemy number one
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:11.000]  he had a conversation with a Russian ambassador
[3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:13.000]  and he said
[3:03:13.000 --> 3:03:15.000]  yeah don't overreact
[3:03:15.000 --> 3:03:17.000]  to the Obama administration sanctions
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:19.000]  based on Russian hacking of the election
[3:03:19.000 --> 3:03:21.000]  which we know was complete BS
[3:03:21.000 --> 3:03:23.000]  no evidence has ever been presented
[3:03:23.000 --> 3:03:25.000]  to substantiate that
[3:03:25.000 --> 3:03:27.000]  all he said was don't overreact
[3:03:27.000 --> 3:03:29.000]  we'll talk about sanctions later on
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:31.000]  didn't even talk about sanctions with them
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:33.000]  the whole issue why Trump accepted
[3:03:33.000 --> 3:03:35.000]  his resignation was
[3:03:35.000 --> 3:03:37.000]  because he didn't tell Pence about it
[3:03:37.000 --> 3:03:39.000]  now there's speculation that Pence is a little bit
[3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:41.000]  more of a neocon which we know is true
[3:03:41.000 --> 3:03:43.000]  now Pence is now thrown his way
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:45.000]  around
[3:03:45.000 --> 3:03:47.000]  yeah and he wanted to have more of an antagonistic
[3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:49.000]  stance towards Russia
[3:03:49.000 --> 3:03:51.000]  whereas Mike Flynn didn't
[3:03:51.000 --> 3:03:53.000]  he wanted to have good relations with Russia
[3:03:53.000 --> 3:03:55.000]  and isn't it ironic Alex that
[3:03:55.000 --> 3:03:57.000]  the mainstream media is all suddenly
[3:03:57.000 --> 3:03:59.000]  concerned about the Logan Act
[3:03:59.000 --> 3:04:01.000]  I mean they said absolutely nothing
[3:04:01.000 --> 3:04:03.000]  whatsoever about it
[3:04:03.000 --> 3:04:05.000]  but decades as US politician
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:07.000]  after US politician violated
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:09.000]  the Logan Act by attending every
[3:04:09.000 --> 3:04:11.000]  Bilderberg meeting but now it's
[3:04:11.000 --> 3:04:13.000]  suddenly this grave breach
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:15.000]  of the Logan Act they've suddenly discovered
[3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:17.000]  it on Wikipedia and now they're all
[3:04:17.000 --> 3:04:19.000]  concerned about it absolutely ridiculous
[3:04:19.000 --> 3:04:21.000]  but I think you know
[3:04:21.000 --> 3:04:23.000]  the only two eras from the Trump
[3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:25.000]  administration were the implementation
[3:04:25.000 --> 3:04:27.000]  of the travel ban which was
[3:04:27.000 --> 3:04:29.000]  bodged that was Brine's previous fault
[3:04:29.000 --> 3:04:31.000]  and pressuring
[3:04:31.000 --> 3:04:33.000]  General Flynn to resign because
[3:04:33.000 --> 3:04:35.000]  now all these leftists have come out
[3:04:35.000 --> 3:04:37.000]  and said they're sniffing blood in the water
[3:04:37.000 --> 3:04:39.000]  now they're going to go for Bannon, Miller
[3:04:39.000 --> 3:04:41.000]  and the rest of them so that's what I'm going to get into
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:43.000]  and they always put out photos showing Flynn
[3:04:43.000 --> 3:04:45.000]  alone thinking by himself
[3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:47.000]  or showing up early to briefings
[3:04:47.000 --> 3:04:49.000]  like oh look he's just staying alone out of the mail
[3:04:49.000 --> 3:04:51.000]  it's bad it's like the archetype of Donald
[3:04:51.000 --> 3:04:53.000]  Trump it's what they hate
[3:04:53.000 --> 3:04:55.000]  they hate somebody that isn't a potbelly pedophile
[3:04:55.000 --> 3:04:57.000]  Paul Watson taking over straight ahead
[3:04:59.000 --> 3:05:01.000]  Students wear white pins to remind them
[3:05:01.000 --> 3:05:03.000]  of white privilege
[3:05:03.000 --> 3:05:05.000]  Ashley Beckford here for infowars.com
[3:05:05.000 --> 3:05:07.000]  That's right liberal Democrats
[3:05:07.000 --> 3:05:09.000]  are about as tolerant as Nazis
[3:05:09.000 --> 3:05:11.000]  reminiscent of the yellow stars
[3:05:11.000 --> 3:05:13.000]  Nazis force the Jews to wear
[3:05:13.000 --> 3:05:15.000]  College Democrats
[3:05:15.000 --> 3:05:17.000]  at Liberal Arts Elizabeth Town College
[3:05:17.000 --> 3:05:19.000]  this month are wearing
[3:05:19.000 --> 3:05:21.000]  white pins in the shape of puzzle pieces
[3:05:21.000 --> 3:05:23.000]  to remind them of their white privilege
[3:05:23.000 --> 3:05:25.000]  Now this is the brain child
[3:05:25.000 --> 3:05:27.000]  of a Lutheran pastor
[3:05:27.000 --> 3:05:29.000]  who made a commitment to wear a white
[3:05:29.000 --> 3:05:31.000]  puzzle piece pin every day
[3:05:31.000 --> 3:05:33.000]  for a year to force herself
[3:05:33.000 --> 3:05:35.000]  to think about her white privilege
[3:05:35.000 --> 3:05:37.000]  and the impact white privilege has
[3:05:37.000 --> 3:05:39.000]  on people of color well as a person
[3:05:39.000 --> 3:05:41.000]  of color I ask you to instead
[3:05:41.000 --> 3:05:43.000]  consider this what is the impact
[3:05:43.000 --> 3:05:45.000]  of continuously fomenting
[3:05:45.000 --> 3:05:47.000]  racial division by focusing
[3:05:47.000 --> 3:05:49.000]  on superficial differences
[3:05:49.000 --> 3:05:51.000]  this article is by the college fix
[3:05:51.000 --> 3:05:53.000]  it's linked on drudgereport.com
[3:05:53.000 --> 3:05:55.000]  stay tuned for more special reports
[3:05:58.000 --> 3:06:00.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter
[3:06:00.000 --> 3:06:02.000]  it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned
[3:06:02.000 --> 3:06:04.000]  it's the air we're breathing especially

[3:06:36.000 --> 3:06:38.000]  the general public doesn't
[3:06:38.000 --> 3:06:40.000]  the Alexa pure breeze would be a steel

[3:08:38.000 --> 3:08:40.000]  enrichment that we continue to enjoy
[3:08:40.000 --> 3:08:42.000]  off the back of the refugee crisis
[3:08:42.000 --> 3:08:44.000]  as they call it and the
[3:08:44.000 --> 3:08:46.000]  sanctuary cities that have been
[3:08:46.000 --> 3:08:48.000]  created throughout Europe
[3:08:48.000 --> 3:08:50.000]  in which we witness this cultural
[3:08:50.000 --> 3:08:52.000]  enrichment on a regular basis I'm talking
[3:08:52.000 --> 3:08:54.000]  about Malmo in Sweden
[3:08:54.000 --> 3:08:56.000]  I'm talking about Paris
[3:08:56.000 --> 3:08:58.000]  in France we're going to tell you
[3:08:58.000 --> 3:09:00.000]  what the sanctuary cities
[3:09:00.000 --> 3:09:02.000]  in Europe have been
[3:09:02.000 --> 3:09:04.000]  experiencing later on in the show
[3:09:04.000 --> 3:09:06.000]  but I want to set the table for this
[3:09:06.000 --> 3:09:08.000]  general Flynn discussion
[3:09:08.000 --> 3:09:10.000]  by going to this clip from Charles
[3:09:10.000 --> 3:09:12.000]  Krauthammer now this was referenced
[3:09:12.000 --> 3:09:14.000]  by Sean Spicer in the official
[3:09:14.000 --> 3:09:16.000]  White House press conference
[3:09:16.000 --> 3:09:18.000]  which ended just over an hour ago
[3:09:18.000 --> 3:09:20.000]  and suddenly Charles Krauthammer
[3:09:20.000 --> 3:09:22.000]  who is a columnist and a Fox News
[3:09:22.000 --> 3:09:24.000]  contributor started trending
[3:09:24.000 --> 3:09:26.000]  on Twitter and it was a devastating
[3:09:26.000 --> 3:09:28.000]  new scandal that Sean
[3:09:28.000 --> 3:09:30.000]  Spicer had quoted Charles
[3:09:30.000 --> 3:09:32.000]  Krauthammer's defence of Trump
[3:09:32.000 --> 3:09:34.000]  in this Flynn situation
[3:09:34.000 --> 3:09:36.000]  because Trump had previously criticised
[3:09:36.000 --> 3:09:38.000]  Charles Krauthammer
[3:09:38.000 --> 3:09:40.000]  and for about half an hour that was the new
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:42.000]  huge scandal of course
[3:09:42.000 --> 3:09:44.000]  Krauthammer's defence of Trump
[3:09:44.000 --> 3:09:46.000]  is more credible given that the two
[3:09:46.000 --> 3:09:48.000]  don't really like each other so again
[3:09:48.000 --> 3:09:50.000]  another complete non-controversy
[3:09:50.000 --> 3:09:52.000]  but he set the table by pointing out
[3:09:52.000 --> 3:09:54.000]  that basically this is
[3:09:54.000 --> 3:09:56.000]  a supposed cover-up as the media
[3:09:56.000 --> 3:09:58.000]  is spinning it of a crime
[3:09:58.000 --> 3:10:00.000]  that never took place
[3:10:00.000 --> 3:10:02.000]  let's go to this clip
[3:10:02.000 --> 3:10:04.000]  let's get more on this first what some are calling
[3:10:04.000 --> 3:10:06.000]  a major personnel crisis
[3:10:06.000 --> 3:10:08.000]  for the Trump administration and what it
[3:10:08.000 --> 3:10:10.000]  could mean for this president going forward
[3:10:10.000 --> 3:10:12.000]  syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer
[3:10:12.000 --> 3:10:14.000]  joins me now from Washington
[3:10:14.000 --> 3:10:16.000]  Charles your thoughts as this is developing
[3:10:16.000 --> 3:10:18.000]  this afternoon
[3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:20.000]  what strikes me is how bizarre
[3:10:20.000 --> 3:10:22.000]  the whole story is
[3:10:22.000 --> 3:10:24.000]  this is a cover-up without a crime
[3:10:24.000 --> 3:10:26.000]  the idea that one should
[3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:28.000]  be all aghast because
[3:10:28.000 --> 3:10:30.000]  the incoming national security advisor
[3:10:30.000 --> 3:10:32.000]  spoke with the Russian ambassador
[3:10:32.000 --> 3:10:34.000]  and spoke about sanctions
[3:10:34.000 --> 3:10:36.000]  seems to me to be perfectly reasonable
[3:10:36.000 --> 3:10:38.000]  the idea that it was illegal
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:40.000]  is preposterous when I hear
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:42.000]  Nancy Pelosi
[3:10:42.000 --> 3:10:44.000]  get all upset about this and how
[3:10:44.000 --> 3:10:46.000]  the grip of the Russians this shows us to be
[3:10:46.000 --> 3:10:48.000]  this is an absurdity
[3:10:48.000 --> 3:10:50.000]  but then you ask yourself well then
[3:10:50.000 --> 3:10:52.000]  why did he lie about it
[3:10:52.000 --> 3:10:54.000]  even internally in talking to the vice president
[3:10:54.000 --> 3:10:56.000]  and that shows a tremendous
[3:10:56.000 --> 3:10:58.000]  lapse of judgment and
[3:10:58.000 --> 3:11:00.000]  a sort of a lack of
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:02.000]  trustworthiness so the president
[3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:04.000]  is faced with a very
[3:11:04.000 --> 3:11:06.000]  difficult problem
[3:11:06.000 --> 3:11:08.000]  if he fires him then
[3:11:08.000 --> 3:11:10.000]  it puts in question the president's own judgment
[3:11:10.000 --> 3:11:12.000]  choosing him in the first place
[3:11:12.000 --> 3:11:14.000]  having to fire him
[3:11:14.000 --> 3:11:16.000]  within three weeks
[3:11:16.000 --> 3:11:18.000]  on the other hand this is a guy who has been
[3:11:18.000 --> 3:11:20.000]  advising him stuck with him
[3:11:20.000 --> 3:11:22.000]  has appeared to have done the right
[3:11:22.000 --> 3:11:24.000]  thing in talking with the Russian
[3:11:24.000 --> 3:11:26.000]  ambassador and done a
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:28.000]  crazy thing in lying about it to Pence
[3:11:28.000 --> 3:11:30.000]  and he's got to decide how it's going to look
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:32.000]  either way it's going to be
[3:11:32.000 --> 3:11:34.000]  he's going to be hurt but if he is going to get
[3:11:34.000 --> 3:11:36.000]  rid of him he better have somebody of
[3:11:36.000 --> 3:11:38.000]  stature waiting in the wings
[3:11:38.000 --> 3:11:40.000]  okay so that was Charles
[3:11:40.000 --> 3:11:42.000]  Krauthammer on Fox News last night of course
[3:11:42.000 --> 3:11:44.000]  a few hours before it was made official that
[3:11:44.000 --> 3:11:46.000]  Trump had accepted general Flynn's
[3:11:46.000 --> 3:11:48.000]  resignation and again he's making
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:50.000]  the point this was a crime without
[3:11:50.000 --> 3:11:52.000]  a cover up during the transitional
[3:11:52.000 --> 3:11:54.000]  period the national
[3:11:54.000 --> 3:11:56.000]  security advisor general Flynn
[3:11:56.000 --> 3:11:58.000]  spoke to a Russian ambassador
[3:11:58.000 --> 3:12:00.000]  and basically told him
[3:12:00.000 --> 3:12:02.000]  please don't overreact to the
[3:12:02.000 --> 3:12:04.000]  Obama administration sanctions
[3:12:04.000 --> 3:12:06.000]  that were applied as a result
[3:12:06.000 --> 3:12:08.000]  of the baseless conspiracy theory
[3:12:08.000 --> 3:12:10.000]  which was never proven
[3:12:10.000 --> 3:12:12.000]  that Russia hacked the election
[3:12:12.000 --> 3:12:14.000]  they didn't even talk about any details
[3:12:14.000 --> 3:12:16.000]  of sanctions any measures that would
[3:12:16.000 --> 3:12:18.000]  take place under a Trump administration
[3:12:18.000 --> 3:12:20.000]  and yet it's the reason
[3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:22.000]  that he didn't tell Mike Pence immediately
[3:12:22.000 --> 3:12:24.000]  that this conversation
[3:12:24.000 --> 3:12:26.000]  took place as to why
[3:12:26.000 --> 3:12:28.000]  he got in the hot water and what led to
[3:12:28.000 --> 3:12:30.000]  his resignation again
[3:12:30.000 --> 3:12:32.000]  as Trump has pointed out
[3:12:32.000 --> 3:12:34.000]  the biggest story here the far
[3:12:34.000 --> 3:12:36.000]  biggest story from an objective perspective
[3:12:36.000 --> 3:12:38.000]  is the fact that who
[3:12:38.000 --> 3:12:40.000]  the question of who's leaking all this information
[3:12:40.000 --> 3:12:42.000]  we have the NSA
[3:12:42.000 --> 3:12:44.000]  spying on the Trump administration
[3:12:44.000 --> 3:12:46.000]  leaking these phone calls
[3:12:46.000 --> 3:12:48.000]  to try and sabotage Trump
[3:12:48.000 --> 3:12:50.000]  it's Obama's acting
[3:12:50.000 --> 3:12:52.000]  Attorney General Sally Yates
[3:12:52.000 --> 3:12:54.000]  the one who was fired by Trump
[3:12:54.000 --> 3:12:56.000]  she was responsible
[3:12:56.000 --> 3:12:58.000]  for leaking this and it's all under the
[3:12:58.000 --> 3:13:00.000]  guys oh we were just giving the White House
[3:13:00.000 --> 3:13:02.000]  a heads up it was organized from
[3:13:02.000 --> 3:13:04.000]  the very beginning by the same
[3:13:04.000 --> 3:13:06.000]  deep state military industrial
[3:13:06.000 --> 3:13:08.000]  complex headed up
[3:13:08.000 --> 3:13:10.000]  by CIA head John Brennan
[3:13:10.000 --> 3:13:12.000]  headed up by James Clapper
[3:13:12.000 --> 3:13:14.000]  they're the ones behind this
[3:13:14.000 --> 3:13:16.000]  they're the ones who leaked this to the media
[3:13:16.000 --> 3:13:18.000]  they're trying to sabotage
[3:13:18.000 --> 3:13:20.000]  undermine the Trump administration
[3:13:20.000 --> 3:13:22.000]  because again
[3:13:22.000 --> 3:13:24.000]  his election completely
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:26.000]  devastated them
[3:13:26.000 --> 3:13:28.000]  on one level it's just sheer but her
[3:13:28.000 --> 3:13:30.000]  again these people even months later
[3:13:30.000 --> 3:13:32.000]  cannot fathom
[3:13:32.000 --> 3:13:34.000]  their neocon warmongering
[3:13:34.000 --> 3:13:36.000]  hag Hillary Clinton
[3:13:36.000 --> 3:13:38.000]  lost and basically made them all
[3:13:38.000 --> 3:13:40.000]  irrelevant they're desperately
[3:13:40.000 --> 3:13:42.000]  seeking to regain relevancy
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:44.000]  they're desperately seeking
[3:13:44.000 --> 3:13:46.000]  to infiltrate the Trump administration
[3:13:46.000 --> 3:13:48.000]  now they've succeeded
[3:13:48.000 --> 3:13:50.000]  in this coup d'etat
[3:13:50.000 --> 3:13:52.000]  and they've got rid of General Flynn
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:54.000]  and it's being celebrated by
[3:13:54.000 --> 3:13:56.000]  the left that's the other irony that's emerged
[3:13:56.000 --> 3:13:58.000]  out of all this elements
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:00.000]  of the CIA the NSA
[3:14:00.000 --> 3:14:02.000]  the military industrial complex
[3:14:02.000 --> 3:14:04.000]  not all of them because of course it's very politicized
[3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:06.000]  but elements of the CIA
[3:14:06.000 --> 3:14:08.000]  the NSA the military industrial complex
[3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:10.000]  are openly sabotaging
[3:14:10.000 --> 3:14:12.000]  Trump and the left
[3:14:12.000 --> 3:14:14.000]  is cheering them on
[3:14:14.000 --> 3:14:16.000]  while claiming they're the resistance
[3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:18.000]  we see this hashtag all over
[3:14:18.000 --> 3:14:20.000]  Twitter the resistance
[3:14:20.000 --> 3:14:22.000]  join the resistance to Trump this is incredible
[3:14:22.000 --> 3:14:24.000]  we're fighting the establishment
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:26.000]  now you are the establishment
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:28.000]  you're literally in bed
[3:14:28.000 --> 3:14:30.000]  with the deep state
[3:14:30.000 --> 3:14:32.000]  with the military industrial complex
[3:14:32.000 --> 3:14:34.000]  with the Hillary neocon alliance
[3:14:34.000 --> 3:14:36.000]  whose foreign policy
[3:14:36.000 --> 3:14:38.000]  created ISIS
[3:14:38.000 --> 3:14:40.000]  whose foreign policy created the migrant crisis
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:42.000]  whose foreign policy
[3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:44.000]  led to all those devastating terror attacks
[3:14:44.000 --> 3:14:46.000]  led to ISIS
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:48.000]  literally feeding children into
[3:14:48.000 --> 3:14:50.000]  meat grinders and feeding them
[3:14:50.000 --> 3:14:52.000]  to their own parents okay
[3:14:52.000 --> 3:14:54.000]  that's what you're a part of
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:14:56.000]  that's the side you're on
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:14:58.000]  not the resistance
[3:14:58.000 --> 3:15:00.000]  that's the deep state
[3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:02.000]  that's the establishment
[3:15:02.000 --> 3:15:04.000]  that's the military industrial complex
[3:15:04.000 --> 3:15:06.000]  but they're all out celebrating this
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:08.000]  because they think now that they've got
[3:15:08.000 --> 3:15:10.000]  Flynn to resign now that they've forced it
[3:15:10.000 --> 3:15:12.000]  and again
[3:15:12.000 --> 3:15:14.000]  you go back to the golden rule
[3:15:14.000 --> 3:15:16.000]  never apologize never back down
[3:15:16.000 --> 3:15:18.000]  this is mistake
[3:15:18.000 --> 3:15:20.000]  number two of the Trump administration
[3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:22.000]  so far again mistake
[3:15:22.000 --> 3:15:24.000]  number one was the roll out of the travel ban
[3:15:24.000 --> 3:15:26.000]  by it being completely constitutional
[3:15:26.000 --> 3:15:28.000]  according to the US code
[3:15:28.000 --> 3:15:30.000]  the mistake was in the roll out
[3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:32.000]  because it then gave them the momentum
[3:15:32.000 --> 3:15:34.000]  to temporarily overturn it
[3:15:34.000 --> 3:15:36.000]  because it wasn't implemented properly
[3:15:36.000 --> 3:15:38.000]  that was Reince previous's fault
[3:15:38.000 --> 3:15:40.000]  the second mistake is
[3:15:40.000 --> 3:15:42.000]  kowtowing to this phony outrage
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:44.000]  based on this complete non scandal
[3:15:44.000 --> 3:15:46.000]  and pressuring Mike Flynn
[3:15:46.000 --> 3:15:48.000]  to resign
[3:15:48.000 --> 3:15:50.000]  and the left is all out cheering this
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:52.000]  again they're part of the resistance
[3:15:52.000 --> 3:15:54.000]  literally in bed with the military industrial complex
[3:15:54.000 --> 3:15:56.000]  but here we go
[3:15:56.000 --> 3:15:58.000]  Mike Sernovich points out in an article on
[3:15:58.000 --> 3:16:00.000]  dangerandplay.com
[3:16:00.000 --> 3:16:02.000]  what general Flynn's resignation
[3:16:02.000 --> 3:16:04.000]  means for America
[3:16:04.000 --> 3:16:06.000]  tonight the fake news media launched
[3:16:06.000 --> 3:16:08.000]  a tactical nuke on America
[3:16:08.000 --> 3:16:10.000]  the line has been broken
[3:16:10.000 --> 3:16:12.000]  and the media now knows Trump is far more
[3:16:12.000 --> 3:16:14.000]  sensitive to bad press than he seemed to be
[3:16:14.000 --> 3:16:16.000]  during the campaign
[3:16:16.000 --> 3:16:18.000]  he goes on to say few understand the significance
[3:16:18.000 --> 3:16:20.000]  of tonight's events as they don't understand
[3:16:20.000 --> 3:16:22.000]  what Trump has fought
[3:16:22.000 --> 3:16:24.000]  the war isn't Republicans vs Democrats
[3:16:24.000 --> 3:16:26.000]  as they are two puppets
[3:16:26.000 --> 3:16:28.000]  of the same master
[3:16:28.000 --> 3:16:30.000]  the war had always been against
[3:16:30.000 --> 3:16:32.000]  the media
[3:16:32.000 --> 3:16:34.000]  consider the source of the media's power
[3:16:34.000 --> 3:16:36.000]  it's you
[3:16:36.000 --> 3:16:38.000]  again if you don't kowtow
[3:16:38.000 --> 3:16:40.000]  to this phony outrage culture
[3:16:40.000 --> 3:16:42.000]  that they created
[3:16:42.000 --> 3:16:44.000]  they have no power whatsoever
[3:16:44.000 --> 3:16:46.000]  he goes on to say Trump's election show
[3:16:46.000 --> 3:16:48.000]  that a candidate could win even with bad press
[3:16:48.000 --> 3:16:50.000]  through the power of social media
[3:16:50.000 --> 3:16:52.000]  you could bypass the media
[3:16:52.000 --> 3:16:54.000]  negating its power
[3:16:54.000 --> 3:16:56.000]  and he goes on to show some of the tweets
[3:16:56.000 --> 3:16:58.000]  which are in this article
[3:16:58.000 --> 3:17:00.000]  from leftists from George Soros bloggers
[3:17:00.000 --> 3:17:02.000]  celebrating
[3:17:02.000 --> 3:17:04.000]  this resignation
[3:17:04.000 --> 3:17:06.000]  Oliver Willis tweeted
[3:17:06.000 --> 3:17:08.000]  Michael Flynn resignation shows Trump bleeds
[3:17:08.000 --> 3:17:10.000]  like everyone else and now there's blood in the water
[3:17:10.000 --> 3:17:12.000]  rise up
[3:17:12.000 --> 3:17:14.000]  hashtag resist
[3:17:14.000 --> 3:17:16.000]  as they literally side with the deep state establishment
[3:17:16.000 --> 3:17:18.000]  again that's the George Soros blogger
[3:17:18.000 --> 3:17:20.000]  see how they're responding to this
[3:17:20.000 --> 3:17:22.000]  David from top neocon
[3:17:22.000 --> 3:17:24.000]  tweeted
[3:17:24.000 --> 3:17:26.000]  tonight's resignation reminds
[3:17:26.000 --> 3:17:28.000]  both why patriots should cherish
[3:17:28.000 --> 3:17:30.000]  a free and independent press
[3:17:30.000 --> 3:17:32.000]  and why Donald Trump so fears and hates it
[3:17:32.000 --> 3:17:34.000]  so they're all loving this
[3:17:34.000 --> 3:17:36.000]  listen to what Michael Moore said
[3:17:36.000 --> 3:17:38.000]  regarding Flynn's resignation
[3:17:38.000 --> 3:17:40.000]  he's only first to go
[3:17:40.000 --> 3:17:42.000]  one by one they will drop
[3:17:42.000 --> 3:17:44.000]  until the so-called president
[3:17:44.000 --> 3:17:46.000]  again
[3:17:46.000 --> 3:17:48.000]  it's about planting that seed of illegitimacy
[3:17:48.000 --> 3:17:50.000]  until the so-called president
[3:17:50.000 --> 3:17:52.000]  is told you're fired
[3:17:52.000 --> 3:17:54.000]  up next Miller
[3:17:54.000 --> 3:17:56.000]  and Bannon
[3:17:56.000 --> 3:17:58.000]  that's Michael Moore
[3:17:58.000 --> 3:18:00.000]  so again they don't see this
[3:18:00.000 --> 3:18:02.000]  as an isolated resignation
[3:18:02.000 --> 3:18:04.000]  as an isolated scandal
[3:18:04.000 --> 3:18:06.000]  this is part of the momentum that they're trying to build
[3:18:06.000 --> 3:18:08.000]  to delegitimize
[3:18:08.000 --> 3:18:10.000]  undermine
[3:18:10.000 --> 3:18:12.000]  and sabotage the Trump administration
[3:18:12.000 --> 3:18:14.000]  and they're doing it in concert
[3:18:14.000 --> 3:18:16.000]  with
[3:18:16.000 --> 3:18:18.000]  the military industrial complex
[3:18:18.000 --> 3:18:20.000]  with the politicized elements of the CIA
[3:18:20.000 --> 3:18:22.000]  and the NSA
[3:18:22.000 --> 3:18:24.000]  and on this score
[3:18:24.000 --> 3:18:26.000]  they won, they won this battle
[3:18:26.000 --> 3:18:28.000]  they forced Flynn to resign
[3:18:28.000 --> 3:18:30.000]  and we'll see what happens going forward
[3:18:30.000 --> 3:18:32.000]  there's a big article up on
[3:18:32.000 --> 3:18:34.000]  infowars.com called
[3:18:34.000 --> 3:18:36.000]  the real reason General Flynn was forced to resign
[3:18:36.000 --> 3:18:38.000]  and again
[3:18:38.000 --> 3:18:40.000]  you can look at the history of this as it relates
[3:18:40.000 --> 3:18:42.000]  because it's scandal
[3:18:42.000 --> 3:18:44.000]  in 1984
[3:18:44.000 --> 3:18:46.000]  again if Democrats meet with Russian officials
[3:18:46.000 --> 3:18:48.000]  it's perfectly fine, it's not a scandal
[3:18:48.000 --> 3:18:50.000]  in 1984 Senator Ted Kennedy
[3:18:50.000 --> 3:18:52.000]  approached the Soviet government
[3:18:52.000 --> 3:18:54.000]  about aiding, defeating
[3:18:54.000 --> 3:18:56.000]  Ronald Reagan's re-election
[3:18:56.000 --> 3:18:58.000]  he offered them diplomatic
[3:18:58.000 --> 3:19:00.000]  and arms control concessions if they would help
[3:19:00.000 --> 3:19:02.000]  install Walter Mondale in the White House
[3:19:02.000 --> 3:19:04.000]  again
[3:19:04.000 --> 3:19:06.000]  the media didn't react in frothing hysteria
[3:19:06.000 --> 3:19:08.000]  when that happened
[3:19:08.000 --> 3:19:10.000]  the media didn't give a damn
[3:19:10.000 --> 3:19:12.000]  about the Logan Act
[3:19:12.000 --> 3:19:14.000]  for the past god knows how many decades
[3:19:14.000 --> 3:19:16.000]  when US politician
[3:19:16.000 --> 3:19:18.000]  after US politician all globalists
[3:19:18.000 --> 3:19:20.000]  of course
[3:19:20.000 --> 3:19:22.000]  violated the Logan Act by scheming
[3:19:22.000 --> 3:19:24.000]  conspiring to set the consensus
[3:19:24.000 --> 3:19:26.000]  for policy when they attended
[3:19:26.000 --> 3:19:28.000]  Bilderberg meetings
[3:19:28.000 --> 3:19:30.000]  a direct violation of the Logan Act
[3:19:30.000 --> 3:19:32.000]  but General Flynn
[3:19:32.000 --> 3:19:34.000]  has a brief cursory
[3:19:34.000 --> 3:19:36.000]  phone call with a Russian ambassador
[3:19:36.000 --> 3:19:38.000]  as the incoming National Security
[3:19:38.000 --> 3:19:40.000]  Advisor
[3:19:40.000 --> 3:19:42.000]  and it's just absolute
[3:19:42.000 --> 3:19:44.000]  outrage again
[3:19:44.000 --> 3:19:46.000]  didn't even talk about sanctions
[3:19:46.000 --> 3:19:48.000]  said please don't overreact
[3:19:48.000 --> 3:19:50.000]  to what the Obama administration has done
[3:19:50.000 --> 3:19:52.000]  complete fake contrived scandal yet again
[3:19:52.000 --> 3:19:54.000]  we'll be back to discuss it more
[3:19:54.000 --> 3:19:56.000]  on the Alex Jones Show Live
[3:19:56.000 --> 3:20:24.000]  on Monday at 6 p.m.

[3:20:28.000 --> 3:20:30.000]  minerals, amino acids, enzymes
[3:20:30.000 --> 3:20:32.000]  and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself
[3:20:32.000 --> 3:20:34.000]  and yes the body does have the ability
[3:20:34.000 --> 3:20:36.000]  to balance blood pressure
[3:20:36.000 --> 3:20:38.000]  now it's cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries
[3:20:38.000 --> 3:20:40.000]  it can also work on
[3:20:40.000 --> 3:20:42.000]  balancing the circulation for diabetics
[3:20:42.000 --> 3:20:44.000]  so the body is an amazing thing
[3:20:44.000 --> 3:20:46.000]  it simply needs some help
[3:20:46.000 --> 3:20:48.000]  so it has tools to heal itself

[3:21:57.000 --> 3:21:59.000]  this is the story
[3:21:59.000 --> 3:22:01.000]  of the shaving company called Harry's
[3:22:01.000 --> 3:22:03.000]  in an epic battle of David vs Goliath
[3:22:03.000 --> 3:22:05.000]  in the early 1980s
[3:22:05.000 --> 3:22:06.000]  a child was born
[3:22:06.000 --> 3:22:07.000]  two of them actually
[3:22:07.000 --> 3:22:09.000]  their names were Jeff and Andy
[3:22:09.000 --> 3:22:10.000]  time went by
[3:22:10.000 --> 3:22:12.000]  they developed facial hair
[3:22:12.000 --> 3:22:14.000]  and one day, something happened
[3:22:14.000 --> 3:22:16.000]  Andy got ripped off by overpriced razors
[3:22:16.000 --> 3:22:18.000]  so they decided to start their own shaving company
[3:22:18.000 --> 3:22:20.000]  and fix shaving once and for all
[3:22:20.000 --> 3:22:22.000]  they hired the best designers
[3:22:22.000 --> 3:22:24.000]  they bought a 95 year old German blade factory
[3:22:24.000 --> 3:22:26.000]  and they started selling high quality razors online
[3:22:26.000 --> 3:22:28.000]  with no upcharging direct to customers
[3:22:28.000 --> 3:22:31.000]  how did the overpriced razor company respond?
[3:22:31.000 --> 3:22:33.000]  by threatening to sue their pants off
[3:22:33.000 --> 3:22:35.000]  don't worry, Jeff and Andy have plenty of pants
[3:22:35.000 --> 3:22:37.000]  and a relentless dream to get all guys

[3:24:16.000 --> 3:24:18.000]  at infowarslife.com
[3:24:18.000 --> 3:24:19.000]  because as you know
[3:24:19.000 --> 3:24:22.000]  we're under constant attack by the establishment
[3:24:22.000 --> 3:24:23.000]  by the mainstream media
[3:24:23.000 --> 3:24:25.000]  because of what we represent
[3:24:25.000 --> 3:24:28.000]  which is a truly authentic news outlet
[3:24:28.000 --> 3:24:31.000]  that is not beholden to corporate interest
[3:24:31.000 --> 3:24:33.000]  that is not beholden to golf state
[3:24:33.000 --> 3:24:36.000]  dictatorships like CNN
[3:24:36.000 --> 3:24:39.000]  that is not beholden to George Soros funding
[3:24:39.000 --> 3:24:41.000]  like Black Lives Matter
[3:24:41.000 --> 3:24:44.000]  and a plethora of other leftist organizations
[3:24:44.000 --> 3:24:47.000]  we don't rely on carrying the can for anyone
[3:24:47.000 --> 3:24:49.000]  we're not funded by anyone
[3:24:49.000 --> 3:24:51.000]  aside from you getting the products
[3:24:51.000 --> 3:24:53.000]  that's why we're completely independent
[3:24:53.000 --> 3:24:55.000]  we're not perfect
[3:24:55.000 --> 3:24:57.000]  but we just go where we think the truth is
[3:24:57.000 --> 3:25:00.000]  and that formula has worked for so many years now
[3:25:00.000 --> 3:25:02.000]  but only because of your support
[3:25:02.000 --> 3:25:05.000]  and now we have at infowarslife.com
[3:25:05.000 --> 3:25:08.000]  the new fluoride free toothpaste
[3:25:08.000 --> 3:25:10.000]  is super blue fluoride free toothpaste
[3:25:10.000 --> 3:25:12.000]  it's back in stock after being sold out
[3:25:12.000 --> 3:25:15.000]  for months at infowarslife.com

[3:25:22.000 --> 3:25:25.000]  can contribute to the development of heart disease and heart attacks
[3:25:25.000 --> 3:25:27.000]  not only that of course
[3:25:27.000 --> 3:25:29.000]  we've seen the studies
[3:25:29.000 --> 3:25:31.000]  study after study showing that
[3:25:31.000 --> 3:25:33.000]  sodium fluoride reduces IQ
[3:25:33.000 --> 3:25:35.000]  it leads to cancer
[3:25:35.000 --> 3:25:38.000]  all these horrible impacts on the body
[3:25:38.000 --> 3:25:41.000]  why do you think they have a warning on fluoride toothpaste
[3:25:41.000 --> 3:25:44.000]  which tells children not to swallow an amount
[3:25:44.000 --> 3:25:47.000]  greater than the size of a pig
[3:25:47.000 --> 3:25:50.000]  this is basically a toxic chemical
[3:25:50.000 --> 3:25:53.000]  if by now you haven't got fluoride free toothpaste
[3:25:53.000 --> 3:25:56.000]  then you obviously haven't been listening to infowars

[3:26:17.000 --> 3:26:19.000]  that's now trying to sabotage Donald Trump
[3:26:19.000 --> 3:26:22.000]  so get the new super blue fluoride free toothpaste

[3:26:28.000 --> 3:26:30.000]  again
[3:26:30.000 --> 3:26:33.000]  by this point everybody must be using fluoride free toothpaste

[3:27:12.000 --> 3:27:14.000]  now getting back into this Flynn thing
[3:27:14.000 --> 3:27:17.000]  before we move on to what's happening in Europe
[3:27:17.000 --> 3:27:19.000]  of course before the break we were talking about
[3:27:19.000 --> 3:27:21.000]  the complete non-controversy
[3:27:21.000 --> 3:27:23.000]  the non-scandal that this represents
[3:27:23.000 --> 3:27:25.000]  of course it's being seized upon
[3:27:25.000 --> 3:27:27.000]  by the anti-trump hysterical media
[3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:29.000]  that is in bed with the deep state
[3:27:29.000 --> 3:27:32.000]  the military industrial complex that is now trying to
[3:27:32.000 --> 3:27:34.000]  sabotage Donald Trump
[3:27:34.000 --> 3:27:36.000]  just three weeks after his inauguration
[3:27:36.000 --> 3:27:39.000]  there's a big article up on infowars.com
[3:27:39.000 --> 3:27:42.000]  the real reason general Flynn was forced to resign
[3:27:42.000 --> 3:27:44.000]  let's read a segment
[3:27:44.000 --> 3:27:47.000]  and this really encapsulates what I've been talking about
[3:27:47.000 --> 3:27:49.000]  there is currently a scorched earth effort
[3:27:49.000 --> 3:27:51.000]  underway to isolate Trump
[3:27:51.000 --> 3:27:53.000]  by purging his administration of people
[3:27:53.000 --> 3:27:56.000]  who truly believe in Trump's vision of America first
[3:27:56.000 --> 3:27:58.000]  replacing them with compromise
[3:27:58.000 --> 3:28:01.000]  Washington insiders and globalists
[3:28:01.000 --> 3:28:04.000]  in other words refilling the swamp
[3:28:04.000 --> 3:28:07.000]  so Flynn is the first casualty of this so far
[3:28:07.000 --> 3:28:10.000]  they hope that there will be others
[3:28:10.000 --> 3:28:12.000]  now they're talking about replacing him
[3:28:12.000 --> 3:28:15.000]  with David Petraeus the Bilderberg member
[3:28:15.000 --> 3:28:17.000]  you see the agenda here
[3:28:17.000 --> 3:28:20.000]  this fifth column is comprised of politically parties
[3:28:20.000 --> 3:28:23.000]  and black cats within the CIA and the NSA
[3:28:23.000 --> 3:28:27.000]  who are still in sense that Hillary Clinton lost
[3:28:27.000 --> 3:28:30.000]  that's right months after her defeat
[3:28:30.000 --> 3:28:32.000]  they still can't accept it
[3:28:32.000 --> 3:28:36.000]  know how the controversy first emerged in the Washington Post
[3:28:36.000 --> 3:28:39.000]  and was leaked by then acting Attorney General Sally Yates
[3:28:39.000 --> 3:28:41.000]  James Clapper and John Brennan
[3:28:41.000 --> 3:28:44.000]  under the guise of alerting the White House
[3:28:44.000 --> 3:28:46.000]  just looking out for Trump there
[3:28:46.000 --> 3:28:48.000]  as the conservative treehouse notes
[3:28:48.000 --> 3:28:51.000]  the Washington Post is the official leak outlet
[3:28:51.000 --> 3:28:54.000]  for the political arm of the CIA
[3:28:54.000 --> 3:28:58.000]  and the most politicized of all agents ever inside the CIA was
[3:28:58.000 --> 3:29:01.000]  John Brennan a black cat extraordinaire
[3:29:01.000 --> 3:29:05.000]  Brennan and his deep state cohorts are heading up a divine and conquer strategy
[3:29:05.000 --> 3:29:08.000]  to drive wedges between Trump cabinet members
[3:29:08.000 --> 3:29:11.000]  while inserting their own people
[3:29:11.000 --> 3:29:14.000]  David Petraeus to sabotage the administration
[3:29:14.000 --> 3:29:18.000]  this is why leaks designed to undermine Trump keep happening
[3:29:18.000 --> 3:29:20.000]  this is why Trump tweets about it
[3:29:20.000 --> 3:29:23.000]  this is why Sean Spicer got up an hour and a half ago
[3:29:23.000 --> 3:29:25.000]  and made the point
[3:29:25.000 --> 3:29:28.000]  why isn't the media asking
[3:29:28.000 --> 3:29:31.000]  who is leaking this information and why
[3:29:31.000 --> 3:29:33.000]  that is a way bigger story
[3:29:33.000 --> 3:29:35.000]  than General Mike Flynn
[3:29:35.000 --> 3:29:37.000]  having a cursory conversation
[3:29:37.000 --> 3:29:39.000]  with the Russian ambassador
[3:29:39.000 --> 3:29:41.000]  before he even takes office
[3:29:41.000 --> 3:29:43.000]  that is the big story
[3:29:43.000 --> 3:29:45.000]  we'll talk more about it after the break
[3:29:45.000 --> 3:29:59.000]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[3:29:59.000 --> 3:30:02.000]  we're selling a product DNA force that is the very best
[3:30:02.000 --> 3:30:05.000]  nutraceutical that we can produce
[3:30:05.000 --> 3:30:08.000]  Dr. Group you took years for you to develop DNA force for us
[3:30:08.000 --> 3:30:11.000]  it's been something that I've been working on for a long time Alex
[3:30:11.000 --> 3:30:14.000]  because I think it's very very important
[3:30:14.000 --> 3:30:17.000]  what the aging process is is when the cell replicates
[3:30:17.000 --> 3:30:20.000]  we lose a little bit of our telomeres
[3:30:20.000 --> 3:30:23.000]  telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes
[3:30:23.000 --> 3:30:25.000]  and when it runs out you start dying
[3:30:25.000 --> 3:30:29.000]  we chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials
[3:30:29.000 --> 3:30:32.000]  it's one of the most effective substances in the world
[3:30:32.000 --> 3:30:34.000]  it works like an antioxidant
[3:30:34.000 --> 3:30:37.000]  it works to repair nerve growth factor
[3:30:37.000 --> 3:30:40.000]  so this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount
[3:30:40.000 --> 3:30:42.000]  it's in powder form
[3:30:42.000 --> 3:30:44.000]  I take many 5 star reviews

[3:33:30.000 --> 3:33:33.000]  so finishing off with this general Flynn story
[3:33:33.000 --> 3:33:37.000]  basically he was the number one target for the deep state fifth columnists
[3:33:37.000 --> 3:33:40.000]  they want to delegitimize, they want to undermine
[3:33:40.000 --> 3:33:42.000]  they want to sabotage the Trump administration
[3:33:42.000 --> 3:33:45.000]  they're doing it in concert with both the Democratic
[3:33:45.000 --> 3:33:47.000]  and Republican establishment
[3:33:47.000 --> 3:33:49.000]  along with the mainstream media
[3:33:49.000 --> 3:33:52.000]  and the agenda is so brazen now
[3:33:52.000 --> 3:33:56.000]  that you had this story which of course was up on George Alex talked about it
[3:33:56.000 --> 3:34:00.000]  Russian insiders for your Washington establishment will assassinate Trump
[3:34:00.000 --> 3:34:02.000]  bearing in mind let's emphasize
[3:34:02.000 --> 3:34:06.000]  this was in foreign policy magazine
[3:34:06.000 --> 3:34:10.000]  okay this isn't some rumor off an internet forum
[3:34:10.000 --> 3:34:13.000]  this isn't the Russian TV host saying this
[3:34:13.000 --> 3:34:16.000]  this is in foreign policy magazine
[3:34:16.000 --> 3:34:19.000]  printed by the Washington Post Company
[3:34:19.000 --> 3:34:24.000]  a magazine edited and run by David Rothkopf
[3:34:24.000 --> 3:34:27.000]  a top globalist, council on foreign relations member
[3:34:27.000 --> 3:34:30.000]  managing director of Kissinger Associates
[3:34:30.000 --> 3:34:32.000]  this is the real deal
[3:34:32.000 --> 3:34:34.000]  and in this article they say
[3:34:34.000 --> 3:34:38.000]  Russian insiders, Kremlin insiders are concerned basically that
[3:34:38.000 --> 3:34:40.000]  they will kill Trump
[3:34:40.000 --> 3:34:43.000]  the Washington establishment will kill Trump
[3:34:43.000 --> 3:34:46.000]  you've seen the entire mainstream media narrative backing that up
[3:34:46.000 --> 3:34:48.000]  for over a year now
[3:34:48.000 --> 3:34:51.000]  that Trump's going to be assassinated and you bet your bottom dollar
[3:34:51.000 --> 3:34:54.000]  if an attempt is made on the president's life
[3:34:54.000 --> 3:34:56.000]  they will celebrate it
[3:34:56.000 --> 3:34:59.000]  they celebrate so-called Nazis getting punched
[3:34:59.000 --> 3:35:01.000]  which is anyone who disagrees with them
[3:35:01.000 --> 3:35:04.000]  they legitimize violence when it's used to shut down
[3:35:04.000 --> 3:35:06.000]  Milo-Unopolis's speech
[3:35:06.000 --> 3:35:09.000]  they legitimize violent hatred across the board
[3:35:09.000 --> 3:35:11.000]  you had New York Times columnists
[3:35:11.000 --> 3:35:13.000]  you had other mainstream media hacks
[3:35:13.000 --> 3:35:15.000]  tweeting
[3:35:15.000 --> 3:35:17.000]  Indian Night of the London Times
[3:35:17.000 --> 3:35:19.000]  tweeting when's the assassination happening
[3:35:19.000 --> 3:35:21.000]  they've built the narrative for this
[3:35:21.000 --> 3:35:23.000]  for over a year
[3:35:23.000 --> 3:35:25.000]  now foreign policy magazine
[3:35:25.000 --> 3:35:27.000]  is brazenly saying
[3:35:27.000 --> 3:35:29.000]  that Russian Kremlin insiders
[3:35:29.000 --> 3:35:31.000]  fear the Washington establishment
[3:35:31.000 --> 3:35:34.000]  will assassinate Donald Trump
[3:35:34.000 --> 3:35:37.000]  again because they're the fifth column
[3:35:37.000 --> 3:35:39.000]  they're trying to sabotage Trump
[3:35:39.000 --> 3:35:41.000]  they are the military industrial complex
[3:35:41.000 --> 3:35:43.000]  they are the deep state
[3:35:43.000 --> 3:35:46.000]  which makes it all the more ridiculous
[3:35:46.000 --> 3:35:49.000]  that you have all these leftists calling themselves
[3:35:49.000 --> 3:35:51.000]  the resistance
[3:35:51.000 --> 3:35:53.000]  when they couldn't be deeper
[3:35:53.000 --> 3:35:56.000]  in bed with the actual establishment
[3:35:56.000 --> 3:35:59.000]  that has poisoned America for decades
[3:35:59.000 --> 3:36:01.000]  the military industrial complex
[3:36:01.000 --> 3:36:03.000]  absolutely astounding
[3:36:03.000 --> 3:36:05.000]  delusion on behalf of the left
[3:36:05.000 --> 3:36:07.000]  this is out of Breitbart
[3:36:07.000 --> 3:36:09.000]  as Flynn resigns
[3:36:09.000 --> 3:36:11.000]  pre-bus future in doubt as Trump
[3:36:11.000 --> 3:36:14.000]  I circulate list of alternate chief of staff candidates
[3:36:14.000 --> 3:36:16.000]  now there is speculation
[3:36:16.000 --> 3:36:18.000]  as Alex has talked about at length
[3:36:18.000 --> 3:36:20.000]  that Rhine's pre-bus is one of these
[3:36:20.000 --> 3:36:22.000]  neocon insiders that has infiltrated
[3:36:22.000 --> 3:36:24.000]  or at least
[3:36:24.000 --> 3:36:26.000]  is completely incompetent
[3:36:26.000 --> 3:36:28.000]  because he was responsible for the rollout
[3:36:28.000 --> 3:36:30.000]  of the travel ban which was a complete disaster
[3:36:30.000 --> 3:36:33.000]  not the policy but the implementation of it
[3:36:33.000 --> 3:36:36.000]  so now Breitbart reports many other potential
[3:36:36.000 --> 3:36:38.000]  cases
[3:36:38.000 --> 3:36:40.000]  in relation to the Obama Attorney General
[3:36:40.000 --> 3:36:42.000]  who was fired by Trump
[3:36:42.000 --> 3:36:44.000]  holdovers from the Obama administration
[3:36:44.000 --> 3:36:46.000]  who have found their way into spots
[3:36:46.000 --> 3:36:48.000]  throughout the Trump administration
[3:36:48.000 --> 3:36:50.000]  away throughout government
[3:36:50.000 --> 3:36:52.000]  one source told Breitbart
[3:36:52.000 --> 3:36:56.000]  quote they're hiding like sleeper cells everywhere
[3:36:56.000 --> 3:36:58.000]  White House and other government sources say
[3:36:58.000 --> 3:37:00.000]  there are as many as 50 of them
[3:37:00.000 --> 3:37:02.000]  throughout government
[3:37:02.000 --> 3:37:04.000]  and pre-bus has full knowledge of their whereabouts
[3:37:04.000 --> 3:37:06.000]  and who they are and what potential for damage
[3:37:06.000 --> 3:37:08.000]  they may cause
[3:37:08.000 --> 3:37:10.000]  so you're talking about at least 50
[3:37:10.000 --> 3:37:12.000]  Obama administration holdouts
[3:37:12.000 --> 3:37:14.000]  that have embedded themselves
[3:37:14.000 --> 3:37:16.000]  within the Trump administration
[3:37:16.000 --> 3:37:18.000]  and are just waiting to leak
[3:37:18.000 --> 3:37:20.000]  more information of course
[3:37:20.000 --> 3:37:22.000]  putting the national security of the country
[3:37:22.000 --> 3:37:24.000]  completely at risk they don't care about that
[3:37:24.000 --> 3:37:26.000]  that's nothing to them because they're hysterical
[3:37:26.000 --> 3:37:28.000]  they hate Trump they've been driven by
[3:37:28.000 --> 3:37:30.000]  Trump derangement syndrome
[3:37:30.000 --> 3:37:32.000]  mass hysteria 50
[3:37:32.000 --> 3:37:34.000]  embedded sleeper cells
[3:37:34.000 --> 3:37:36.000]  Obama administration holdovers
[3:37:36.000 --> 3:37:38.000]  in the Trump administration
[3:37:38.000 --> 3:37:40.000]  just waiting to leak
[3:37:40.000 --> 3:37:42.000]  more intel that the media can then
[3:37:42.000 --> 3:37:44.000]  spin into another massive
[3:37:44.000 --> 3:37:46.000]  controversy so don't think
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:37:48.000]  by any stretch of the imagination
[3:37:48.000 --> 3:37:50.000]  that this is the end of it
[3:37:50.000 --> 3:37:52.000]  moving on
[3:37:52.000 --> 3:37:54.000]  Fox News reports again this completely exemplifies
[3:37:54.000 --> 3:37:56.000]  the supposed
[3:37:56.000 --> 3:37:58.000]  feigned neutrality of the mainstream
[3:37:58.000 --> 3:38:00.000]  media complete BS
[3:38:00.000 --> 3:38:02.000]  New York Times reporter apologizes
[3:38:02.000 --> 3:38:04.000]  for calling First Lady Melania Trump a
[3:38:04.000 --> 3:38:06.000]  hooker and you will notice
[3:38:06.000 --> 3:38:08.000]  that many of their biases tend to
[3:38:08.000 --> 3:38:10.000]  slip out in private conversations
[3:38:10.000 --> 3:38:12.000]  while the New York Times reporter that
[3:38:12.000 --> 3:38:14.000]  referred to First Lady Melania Trump as a hooker
[3:38:14.000 --> 3:38:16.000]  has apologized
[3:38:16.000 --> 3:38:18.000]  I want to take ownership of a mistake I made
[3:38:18.000 --> 3:38:20.000]  New York Times Features writer Jacob Bernstein said
[3:38:20.000 --> 3:38:22.000]  on Twitter speaking
[3:38:22.000 --> 3:38:24.000]  at a party in what I thought was a
[3:38:24.000 --> 3:38:26.000]  personal conversation I nevertheless
[3:38:26.000 --> 3:38:28.000]  nevertheless made a stupid remark about the First Lady
[3:38:28.000 --> 3:38:30.000]  so basically
[3:38:30.000 --> 3:38:32.000]  this New York Times reporter
[3:38:32.000 --> 3:38:34.000]  told the model
[3:38:34.000 --> 3:38:36.000]  whose name I can't pronounce
[3:38:36.000 --> 3:38:38.000]  Emily Rochowsky I think it is
[3:38:38.000 --> 3:38:40.000]  told the model at a party
[3:38:40.000 --> 3:38:42.000]  that Melania Trump was a
[3:38:42.000 --> 3:38:44.000]  hooker she actually went public
[3:38:44.000 --> 3:38:46.000]  with this credit to her
[3:38:46.000 --> 3:38:48.000]  because now she probably faces the wrath
[3:38:48.000 --> 3:38:50.000]  of the leftist entertainment industry
[3:38:50.000 --> 3:38:52.000]  establishment who are
[3:38:52.000 --> 3:38:54.000]  painfully intolerant people
[3:38:54.000 --> 3:38:56.000]  they're all for diversity until it comes to
[3:38:56.000 --> 3:38:58.000]  diversity of thought which they viciously police
[3:38:58.000 --> 3:39:00.000]  and excommunicate people for
[3:39:00.000 --> 3:39:02.000]  if they don't go along with the leftist grain
[3:39:02.000 --> 3:39:04.000]  but it was the model
[3:39:04.000 --> 3:39:06.000]  Emily Rochowsky who revealed in a tweet
[3:39:06.000 --> 3:39:08.000]  Monday that an unidentified New York Times
[3:39:08.000 --> 3:39:10.000]  reporter called the First Lady a hooker
[3:39:10.000 --> 3:39:12.000]  so she tweeted that out
[3:39:12.000 --> 3:39:14.000]  and then he had to go out publicly
[3:39:14.000 --> 3:39:16.000]  apologize for saying that Melania
[3:39:16.000 --> 3:39:18.000]  Trump was a hooker again
[3:39:18.000 --> 3:39:20.000]  exposing the fact that he's
[3:39:20.000 --> 3:39:22.000]  a completely biased hack
[3:39:22.000 --> 3:39:24.000]  working for the New York Times
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:26.000]  some of which still tries
[3:39:26.000 --> 3:39:28.000]  to maintain this feigned neutrality
[3:39:28.000 --> 3:39:30.000]  when it comes to coverage of Trump which we all know
[3:39:30.000 --> 3:39:32.000]  is a complete dishonest lie
[3:39:32.000 --> 3:39:34.000]  the New York Times
[3:39:34.000 --> 3:39:36.000]  also published fake tweets
[3:39:36.000 --> 3:39:38.000]  New York Times coming out
[3:39:38.000 --> 3:39:40.000]  with fake news well imagine my shock
[3:39:40.000 --> 3:39:42.000]  fake news fake tweets
[3:39:42.000 --> 3:39:44.000]  by Michael Flynn they came from
[3:39:44.000 --> 3:39:46.000]  a fake account but the New York Times
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:48.000]  included them in their coverage
[3:39:48.000 --> 3:39:50.000]  of his resignation American
[3:39:50.000 --> 3:39:52.000]  Mirror reports Nancy
[3:39:52.000 --> 3:39:54.000]  Pelosi slams Mike Flynn over
[3:39:54.000 --> 3:39:56.000]  parody tweets
[3:39:56.000 --> 3:39:58.000]  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi
[3:39:58.000 --> 3:40:00.000]  lashed out at former National Security Advisor
[3:40:00.000 --> 3:40:02.000]  Michael Flynn today over a series
[3:40:02.000 --> 3:40:04.000]  of tweets from a parody Twitter account
[3:40:04.000 --> 3:40:06.000]  so basically a fake
[3:40:06.000 --> 3:40:08.000]  Twitter account tweeted out that
[3:40:08.000 --> 3:40:10.000]  General Mike Flynn thought it was
[3:40:10.000 --> 3:40:12.000]  necessary for him to be the scapegoat
[3:40:12.000 --> 3:40:14.000]  for the Trump administration
[3:40:14.000 --> 3:40:16.000]  and that's why he resigned
[3:40:16.000 --> 3:40:18.000]  Nancy Pelosi and all these
[3:40:18.000 --> 3:40:20.000]  other Democrats got up in front
[3:40:20.000 --> 3:40:22.000]  of a press conference
[3:40:22.000 --> 3:40:24.000]  and said that these were real
[3:40:24.000 --> 3:40:26.000]  tweets and then she went into a diatribe
[3:40:26.000 --> 3:40:28.000]  about how he's lying
[3:40:28.000 --> 3:40:30.000]  that he's not a scapegoat again completely
[3:40:30.000 --> 3:40:32.000]  fake tweets fake account
[3:40:32.000 --> 3:40:34.000]  but Nancy Pelosi gets up and talks
[3:40:34.000 --> 3:40:36.000]  about it New York Times puts it in
[3:40:36.000 --> 3:40:38.000]  print and they just quietly
[3:40:38.000 --> 3:40:40.000]  try to move on while lecturing us
[3:40:40.000 --> 3:40:42.000]  and everyone else that wear fake news while
[3:40:42.000 --> 3:40:44.000]  they're literally printing
[3:40:44.000 --> 3:40:46.000]  fake news so you
[3:40:46.000 --> 3:40:48.000]  have that going on you have
[3:40:48.000 --> 3:40:50.000]  of course what's happening in Europe
[3:40:50.000 --> 3:40:52.000]  which we can move on to now
[3:40:52.000 --> 3:40:54.000]  sanctuary cities throughout
[3:40:54.000 --> 3:40:56.000]  Europe which have accepted
[3:40:56.000 --> 3:40:58.000]  millions of Muslim
[3:40:58.000 --> 3:41:00.000]  migrants well what do you know
[3:41:00.000 --> 3:41:02.000]  they're now erupting into riots
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:04.000]  violent attacks on reporters
[3:41:04.000 --> 3:41:06.000]  while people Chan
[3:41:06.000 --> 3:41:08.000]  Ella Akbar this is
[3:41:08.000 --> 3:41:10.000]  what has happened in France which has the highest
[3:41:10.000 --> 3:41:12.000]  Muslim population
[3:41:12.000 --> 3:41:14.000]  in Europe everywhere
[3:41:14.000 --> 3:41:16.000]  that Islamic ghettos exist
[3:41:16.000 --> 3:41:18.000]  you have high crime
[3:41:18.000 --> 3:41:20.000]  you have high rates of sexual assault
[3:41:20.000 --> 3:41:22.000]  you have violence you have
[3:41:22.000 --> 3:41:24.000]  riots because multiculturalism
[3:41:24.000 --> 3:41:26.000]  has failed it doesn't
[3:41:26.000 --> 3:41:28.000]  work bringing in huge numbers
[3:41:28.000 --> 3:41:30.000]  of people who aren't integrated and don't want
[3:41:30.000 --> 3:41:32.000]  to integrate and housing them
[3:41:32.000 --> 3:41:34.000]  in these high rise hopeless
[3:41:34.000 --> 3:41:36.000]  ghettos only leads
[3:41:36.000 --> 3:41:38.000]  to violence and unrest
[3:41:38.000 --> 3:41:40.000]  how many times do we need to see
[3:41:40.000 --> 3:41:42.000]  it before we reverse this policy
[3:41:42.000 --> 3:41:44.000]  it happened back in 2005
[3:41:44.000 --> 3:41:46.000]  in Paris it's happening right
[3:41:46.000 --> 3:41:48.000]  now and you can go ahead
[3:41:48.000 --> 3:41:50.000]  and roll the clip of these riots
[3:41:50.000 --> 3:41:52.000]  as they've been unfolding over the past
[3:41:52.000 --> 3:41:54.000]  few nights the UK
[3:41:54.000 --> 3:41:56.000]  Express reports Paris erupts
[3:41:56.000 --> 3:41:58.000]  in violence many streets and no go zones
[3:41:58.000 --> 3:42:00.000]  as five suburbs in flames
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:02.000]  again I looked into the
[3:42:02.000 --> 3:42:04.000]  areas in which this was taking place
[3:42:04.000 --> 3:42:06.000]  it's suburban areas in northern Paris
[3:42:06.000 --> 3:42:08.000]  and what do you know
[3:42:08.000 --> 3:42:10.000]  population 33% Muslim
[3:42:10.000 --> 3:42:12.000]  again just a coincidence
[3:42:12.000 --> 3:42:14.000]  police in Paris are struggling to cope
[3:42:14.000 --> 3:42:16.000]  with the fallout from a plague of riots
[3:42:16.000 --> 3:42:18.000]  which have kicked off in the cities northern suburbs
[3:42:18.000 --> 3:42:20.000]  five large areas have been
[3:42:20.000 --> 3:42:22.000]  reduced to no go areas for the past five
[3:42:22.000 --> 3:42:24.000]  nights as masked men cause mayhem on the streets
[3:42:24.000 --> 3:42:26.000]  now remember that after the
[3:42:26.000 --> 3:42:28.000]  Paris attacks
[3:42:28.000 --> 3:42:30.000]  people were criticised
[3:42:30.000 --> 3:42:32.000]  people were publicly shamed
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:34.000]  for even claiming
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:36.000]  that there were Muslim no go ghetto areas
[3:42:36.000 --> 3:42:38.000]  in Paris that was a conspiracy theory
[3:42:38.000 --> 3:42:40.000]  back as little as
[3:42:40.000 --> 3:42:42.000]  18 months ago well look what's happening
[3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:44.000]  now residents have been
[3:42:44.000 --> 3:42:46.000]  on lockdown as armed police try to tackle
[3:42:46.000 --> 3:42:48.000]  the rioters who of course millions of pounds
[3:42:48.000 --> 3:42:50.000]  of damage again they were
[3:42:50.000 --> 3:42:52.000]  the thing that sparked this
[3:42:52.000 --> 3:42:54.000]  and it never takes much to spark
[3:42:54.000 --> 3:42:56.000]  it was the alleged mistreatment and rape
[3:42:56.000 --> 3:42:58.000]  of a suspect by police
[3:42:58.000 --> 3:43:00.000]  they responded by burning down
[3:43:00.000 --> 3:43:02.000]  their own community by attacking
[3:43:02.000 --> 3:43:04.000]  TV reporters
[3:43:04.000 --> 3:43:06.000]  cars set on fire
[3:43:06.000 --> 3:43:08.000]  numerous different districts in Paris
[3:43:08.000 --> 3:43:10.000]  affected
[3:43:10.000 --> 3:43:12.000]  and it centres on the horrific
[3:43:12.000 --> 3:43:14.000]  police brutality alleged in a housing
[3:43:14.000 --> 3:43:16.000]  estate called Rosé de Vaughn
[3:43:16.000 --> 3:43:18.000]  which is known locally as the city of
[3:43:18.000 --> 3:43:20.000]  3000 again they build these huge
[3:43:20.000 --> 3:43:22.000]  horrible ghetto
[3:43:22.000 --> 3:43:24.000]  towers
[3:43:24.000 --> 3:43:26.000]  which are designed
[3:43:26.000 --> 3:43:28.000]  physically designed to encourage crime
[3:43:28.000 --> 3:43:30.000]  to encourage unrest to encourage hopelessness
[3:43:30.000 --> 3:43:32.000]  fill them
[3:43:32.000 --> 3:43:34.000]  with immigrants from Islamic
[3:43:34.000 --> 3:43:36.000]  countries who aren't integrated have no
[3:43:36.000 --> 3:43:38.000]  access
[3:43:38.000 --> 3:43:40.000]  and then they act surprised at what happens
[3:43:40.000 --> 3:43:42.000]  these are the fruits of
[3:43:42.000 --> 3:43:44.000]  multiculturalism these are the fruits of
[3:43:44.000 --> 3:43:46.000]  sanctuary cities
[3:43:46.000 --> 3:43:48.000]  the article continues
[3:43:48.000 --> 3:43:50.000]  local residents and police forces have called
[3:43:50.000 --> 3:43:52.000]  the continued unrest disgraceful
[3:43:52.000 --> 3:43:54.000]  while the man allegedly assaulted by police
[3:43:54.000 --> 3:43:56.000]  named only as Theo has pleaded for calm
[3:43:56.000 --> 3:43:58.000]  so even the guy who was
[3:43:58.000 --> 3:44:00.000]  allegedly raped by police
[3:44:00.000 --> 3:44:02.000]  is telling them to stop
[3:44:02.000 --> 3:44:04.000]  Eve LeFarbe
[3:44:04.000 --> 3:44:06.000]  police union said
[3:44:06.000 --> 3:44:08.000]  while setting a wheelchair van on fire
[3:44:08.000 --> 3:44:10.000]  is a disgrace this has to stop
[3:44:10.000 --> 3:44:12.000]  so again they attack police they attack
[3:44:12.000 --> 3:44:14.000]  firemen they attack ambulance workers
[3:44:14.000 --> 3:44:16.000]  they set wheelchair vans on fire
[3:44:16.000 --> 3:44:18.000]  what on earth has that got to do with the
[3:44:18.000 --> 3:44:20.000]  mistreatment alleged mistreatment of
[3:44:20.000 --> 3:44:22.000]  one individual no justification
[3:44:22.000 --> 3:44:24.000]  whatsoever
[3:44:24.000 --> 3:44:26.000]  the French government's response to the
[3:44:26.000 --> 3:44:28.000]  latest outbreaks of violence is to put
[3:44:28.000 --> 3:44:30.000]  2600 cameras on police officers to record
[3:44:30.000 --> 3:44:32.000]  them out on the job
[3:44:32.000 --> 3:44:34.000]  so France's socialist government is more
[3:44:34.000 --> 3:44:36.000]  concerned about
[3:44:36.000 --> 3:44:38.000]  police brutality than the fact that
[3:44:38.000 --> 3:44:40.000]  Paris' areas of
[3:44:40.000 --> 3:44:42.000]  Paris are literally being burned to the ground
[3:44:42.000 --> 3:44:44.000]  right now but that's the main concern
[3:44:44.000 --> 3:44:46.000]  is documenting what the police are doing
[3:44:46.000 --> 3:44:48.000]  last night it was claimed
[3:44:48.000 --> 3:44:50.000]  well it wasn't claimed I've seen the video
[3:44:50.000 --> 3:44:52.000]  I've heard it it was claimed rioters
[3:44:52.000 --> 3:44:54.000]  shattered Allah Akbar during violent protests
[3:44:54.000 --> 3:44:56.000]  in Paris where a car was set on fire
[3:44:56.000 --> 3:44:58.000]  and again
[3:44:58.000 --> 3:45:00.000]  the areas in which these riots are happening
[3:45:00.000 --> 3:45:02.000]  at least 33%
[3:45:02.000 --> 3:45:04.000]  Muslim probably more in most cases
[3:45:04.000 --> 3:45:06.000]  front national
[3:45:06.000 --> 3:45:08.000]  MP Marion Le Pen who is the daughter
[3:45:08.000 --> 3:45:10.000]  of Marine Le Pen
[3:45:10.000 --> 3:45:12.000]  or the niece tweeted the amateur video
[3:45:12.000 --> 3:45:14.000]  which shows chaotic scenes including
[3:45:14.000 --> 3:45:16.000]  clouds and smoke after cars were set on fire
[3:45:16.000 --> 3:45:18.000]  and a man yelling Allah Akbar
[3:45:18.000 --> 3:45:20.000]  Arabic but God is greatest
[3:45:20.000 --> 3:45:22.000]  three times
[3:45:22.000 --> 3:45:24.000]  so each
[3:45:24.000 --> 3:45:26.000]  time
[3:45:26.000 --> 3:45:28.000]  Paris experiences more of these scenes
[3:45:28.000 --> 3:45:30.000]  these cars being torched
[3:45:30.000 --> 3:45:32.000]  police ambulance workers firemen
[3:45:32.000 --> 3:45:34.000]  reporters being attacked
[3:45:34.000 --> 3:45:36.000]  in these immigrant suburban areas
[3:45:36.000 --> 3:45:38.000]  the more votes
[3:45:38.000 --> 3:45:40.000]  captured by Marine Le Pen
[3:45:40.000 --> 3:45:42.000]  which is what they're worried about
[3:45:42.000 --> 3:45:44.000]  because several of the other candidates in the French
[3:45:44.000 --> 3:45:46.000]  presidential election which is coming up
[3:45:46.000 --> 3:45:48.000]  first round I believe at the end of next month
[3:45:48.000 --> 3:45:50.000]  they're all mired in scandal
[3:45:50.000 --> 3:45:52.000]  Le Pen is going to win the first round
[3:45:52.000 --> 3:45:54.000]  of course the way it's set up
[3:45:54.000 --> 3:45:56.000]  in France
[3:45:56.000 --> 3:45:58.000]  renegade candidate can never
[3:45:58.000 --> 3:46:00.000]  truly capture victory
[3:46:00.000 --> 3:46:02.000]  because they all pile in
[3:46:02.000 --> 3:46:04.000]  for the establishment candidates in the second round
[3:46:04.000 --> 3:46:06.000]  but again they're still intensely
[3:46:06.000 --> 3:46:08.000]  worried about Marine Le Pen winning
[3:46:08.000 --> 3:46:10.000]  the election which is why George Soros
[3:46:10.000 --> 3:46:12.000]  is now funding Google
[3:46:12.000 --> 3:46:14.000]  to stop populist Le Pen
[3:46:14.000 --> 3:46:16.000]  this is an article up on
[3:46:16.000 --> 3:46:18.000]  informals.com by Jerome Corsi
[3:46:18.000 --> 3:46:20.000]  though largely not
[3:46:20.000 --> 3:46:22.000]  reported by the mainstream media George Soros
[3:46:22.000 --> 3:46:24.000]  has invested in Google as it stepped up
[3:46:24.000 --> 3:46:26.000]  its fake news campaign
[3:46:26.000 --> 3:46:28.000]  designed to depress the vote
[3:46:28.000 --> 3:46:30.000]  of anti-globalist Marine Le Pen
[3:46:30.000 --> 3:46:32.000]  isn't it interesting that fake news
[3:46:32.000 --> 3:46:34.000]  only ever benefits candidates
[3:46:34.000 --> 3:46:36.000]  who oppose the globalists
[3:46:36.000 --> 3:46:38.000]  and who oppose the establishment
[3:46:38.000 --> 3:46:40.000]  isn't that interesting
[3:46:40.000 --> 3:46:42.000]  could it be that this fake news
[3:46:42.000 --> 3:46:44.000]  scandal has been completely contrived
[3:46:44.000 --> 3:46:46.000]  as part of an effort
[3:46:46.000 --> 3:46:48.000]  to censor and crush
[3:46:48.000 --> 3:46:50.000]  support for those anti-globalist
[3:46:50.000 --> 3:46:52.000]  candidates? Gee I wonder
[3:46:52.000 --> 3:46:54.000]  in every single country
[3:46:54.000 --> 3:46:56.000]  in which these anti-globalist candidates
[3:46:56.000 --> 3:46:58.000]  are performing well whether it be
[3:46:58.000 --> 3:47:00.000]  Marine Le Pen in France
[3:47:00.000 --> 3:47:02.000]  Gert Wilders in Holland
[3:47:02.000 --> 3:47:04.000]  or any other European country
[3:47:04.000 --> 3:47:06.000]  they cite fake news they say
[3:47:06.000 --> 3:47:08.000]  we need to censor quote fake news
[3:47:08.000 --> 3:47:10.000]  because these populists are just getting too
[3:47:10.000 --> 3:47:12.000]  successful
[3:47:12.000 --> 3:47:14.000]  of course the Stanford University study
[3:47:14.000 --> 3:47:16.000]  which came out a couple of weeks ago
[3:47:16.000 --> 3:47:18.000]  confirmed that fake news
[3:47:18.000 --> 3:47:20.000]  had no impact whatsoever
[3:47:20.000 --> 3:47:22.000]  however on the US presidential election
[3:47:22.000 --> 3:47:24.000]  completely debunked
[3:47:24.000 --> 3:47:26.000]  done narrative
[3:47:26.000 --> 3:47:28.000]  dead
[3:47:28.000 --> 3:47:30.000]  quietly they just glossed
[3:47:30.000 --> 3:47:32.000]  over that article and still
[3:47:32.000 --> 3:47:34.000]  this entire fake news narrative remains
[3:47:34.000 --> 3:47:36.000]  part of the mainstream media narrative
[3:47:36.000 --> 3:47:38.000]  even though provably
[3:47:38.000 --> 3:47:40.000]  manifestly fake news did not
[3:47:40.000 --> 3:47:42.000]  win the election for Donald Trump
[3:47:42.000 --> 3:47:44.000]  had no impact whatsoever
[3:47:44.000 --> 3:47:46.000]  Stanford University study
[3:47:46.000 --> 3:47:48.000]  admits it but now George
[3:47:48.000 --> 3:47:50.000]  Soros is funding this first draft
[3:47:50.000 --> 3:47:52.000]  technology company
[3:47:52.000 --> 3:47:54.000]  which again is working with Facebook
[3:47:54.000 --> 3:47:56.000]  in France to try and censor
[3:47:56.000 --> 3:47:58.000]  content that's pro
[3:47:58.000 --> 3:48:00.000]  Marine Le Pen
[3:48:00.000 --> 3:48:02.000]  she's kicking their ass on the field
[3:48:02.000 --> 3:48:04.000]  so they have to change the rules
[3:48:04.000 --> 3:48:06.000]  they have to cheat
[3:48:06.000 --> 3:48:08.000]  to try and cheat her out of
[3:48:08.000 --> 3:48:10.000]  potentially becoming the next
[3:48:10.000 --> 3:48:12.000]  president of France
[3:48:12.000 --> 3:48:14.000]  and you know Hillary Clinton basically
[3:48:14.000 --> 3:48:16.000]  ran on the platform of
[3:48:16.000 --> 3:48:18.000]  having a vagina she was a woman
[3:48:18.000 --> 3:48:20.000]  isn't it interesting that
[3:48:20.000 --> 3:48:22.000]  France has never had a female president
[3:48:22.000 --> 3:48:24.000]  so why isn't everybody supporting
[3:48:24.000 --> 3:48:26.000]  Marine Le Pen because she has
[3:48:26.000 --> 3:48:28.000]  a vagina I mean that was enough
[3:48:28.000 --> 3:48:30.000]  for Hillary Clinton
[3:48:30.000 --> 3:48:32.000]  we were all told we were misogynists
[3:48:32.000 --> 3:48:34.000]  and sexists for not supporting her
[3:48:34.000 --> 3:48:36.000]  why not Marine Le Pen
[3:48:36.000 --> 3:48:38.000]  different rules apply because she's not
[3:48:38.000 --> 3:48:40.000]  a left wing establishment figure
[3:48:40.000 --> 3:48:42.000]  every single time
[3:48:42.000 --> 3:48:44.000]  and so they're trying to crush
[3:48:44.000 --> 3:48:46.000]  and they're trying to crush
[3:48:46.000 --> 3:48:48.000]  censor support for Marine Le Pen
[3:48:48.000 --> 3:48:50.000]  in France as
[3:48:50.000 --> 3:48:52.000]  areas of Paris burn to the ground
[3:48:52.000 --> 3:48:54.000]  as a result of the
[3:48:54.000 --> 3:48:56.000]  migrants that they've imported on mass
[3:48:56.000 --> 3:48:58.000]  and speaking of the same
[3:48:58.000 --> 3:49:00.000]  subject the cultural
[3:49:00.000 --> 3:49:02.000]  enrichment of Europe
[3:49:02.000 --> 3:49:04.000]  Swedish electricity company pulls out of
[3:49:04.000 --> 3:49:06.000]  multicultural Malmo citing security risk
[3:49:06.000 --> 3:49:08.000]  an electrical maintenance
[3:49:08.000 --> 3:49:10.000]  company has announced it can no longer serve
[3:49:10.000 --> 3:49:12.000]  customers in the multicultural
[3:49:12.000 --> 3:49:14.000]  Swedish city of Malmo
[3:49:14.000 --> 3:49:16.000]  citing security risks and increasing violence
[3:49:16.000 --> 3:49:18.000]  in a message posted on the company's
[3:49:18.000 --> 3:49:20.000]  Facebook page
[3:49:20.000 --> 3:49:22.000]  Pogs EL states that it can no longer
[3:49:22.000 --> 3:49:24.000]  operate in Malmo due to skyrocketing
[3:49:24.000 --> 3:49:26.000]  skyrocketing violence and
[3:49:26.000 --> 3:49:28.000]  shootings now just by coincidence
[3:49:28.000 --> 3:49:30.000]  Malmo has
[3:49:30.000 --> 3:49:32.000]  a 43% foreign
[3:49:32.000 --> 3:49:34.000]  population gee I wonder
[3:49:34.000 --> 3:49:36.000]  if there's some kind of connection
[3:49:36.000 --> 3:49:38.000]  between riots
[3:49:38.000 --> 3:49:40.000]  explosions
[3:49:40.000 --> 3:49:42.000]  sexual assaults on a regular basis
[3:49:42.000 --> 3:49:44.000]  complete bedlam
[3:49:44.000 --> 3:49:46.000]  unrest and the fact that
[3:49:46.000 --> 3:49:48.000]  areas of Malmo have
[3:49:48.000 --> 3:49:50.000]  90% Muslim migrant population
[3:49:50.000 --> 3:49:52.000]  I'm sure it's just a complete
[3:49:52.000 --> 3:49:54.000]  coincidence
[3:49:54.000 --> 3:49:56.000]  of course in an interview with Breitbart
[3:49:56.000 --> 3:49:58.000]  chief superintendent of Malmo
[3:49:58.000 --> 3:50:00.000]  now retired Torsten Alofsen
[3:50:00.000 --> 3:50:02.000]  explained how mass immigration
[3:50:02.000 --> 3:50:04.000]  has turned some areas of Malmo
[3:50:04.000 --> 3:50:06.000]  into mini war zones
[3:50:06.000 --> 3:50:08.000]  he said quote Malmo is
[3:50:08.000 --> 3:50:10.000]  the most for explosions yet thankfully
[3:50:10.000 --> 3:50:12.000]  nobody has been killed by the explosions
[3:50:12.000 --> 3:50:14.000]  some of them are just used to frighten people
[3:50:14.000 --> 3:50:16.000]  again I've got friends
[3:50:16.000 --> 3:50:18.000]  who go to Malmo
[3:50:18.000 --> 3:50:20.000]  every other month they describe
[3:50:20.000 --> 3:50:22.000]  these exact scenes
[3:50:22.000 --> 3:50:24.000]  just random explosions going off
[3:50:24.000 --> 3:50:26.000]  as you walk down the street just people throwing grenades
[3:50:26.000 --> 3:50:28.000]  again
[3:50:28.000 --> 3:50:30.000]  this is the fruit that Europe's
[3:50:30.000 --> 3:50:32.000]  sanctuary cities that cultural
[3:50:32.000 --> 3:50:34.000]  enrichment has brought us
[3:50:34.000 --> 3:50:36.000]  of course now in Sweden they're starting
[3:50:36.000 --> 3:50:38.000]  to rebel against that we have
[3:50:38.000 --> 3:50:40.000]  the Swedish spring
[3:50:40.000 --> 3:50:42.000]  a top cop going public
[3:50:42.000 --> 3:50:44.000]  pointing out
[3:50:44.000 --> 3:50:46.000]  the massive crime surge that has resulted
[3:50:46.000 --> 3:50:48.000]  as a result of Sweden
[3:50:48.000 --> 3:50:50.000]  opening its doors wide open
[3:50:50.000 --> 3:50:52.000]  to mass immigration we'll be back

[3:55:33.440 --> 3:55:39.240]  Now, JK Rowling, the net worth one billion Harry Potter
[3:55:39.240 --> 3:55:43.560]  author, continually lectures everybody in the United Kingdom
[3:55:43.560 --> 3:55:45.920]  about how we need to take in more refugees.
[3:55:45.920 --> 3:55:50.920]  Of course, we already taken net 300,000 immigrants
[3:55:50.920 --> 3:55:54.120]  every single year in a tiny island country
[3:55:54.120 --> 3:55:56.320]  with a population of about 65 million.
[3:55:56.320 --> 3:55:57.400]  But now that's not enough.
[3:55:57.400 --> 3:55:59.560]  We need to take in more.
[3:55:59.560 --> 3:56:01.800]  Problem with that is that there's a chronic housing
[3:56:01.800 --> 3:56:03.800]  shortage in the United Kingdom.
[3:56:03.800 --> 3:56:06.160]  Literally, nobody can afford to buy a house.
[3:56:06.160 --> 3:56:08.680]  They have to build hundreds of thousands of new houses
[3:56:08.680 --> 3:56:12.080]  every year simply to try and keep up with the demand.
[3:56:12.080 --> 3:56:13.200]  And it's not enough.
[3:56:13.200 --> 3:56:16.240]  There's a dire housing shortage.
[3:56:16.240 --> 3:56:20.400]  So she says we need to take in more refugees, more migrants.
[3:56:20.400 --> 3:56:21.920]  Well, that's fine, JK Rowling.
[3:56:21.920 --> 3:56:25.600]  But you need to put your money where your mouth is.
[3:56:25.600 --> 3:56:28.000]  Now, if you look at JK Rowling's history, again,
[3:56:28.000 --> 3:56:35.080]  net worth $1 billion, she bought a house and she bulldozed.
[3:56:35.080 --> 3:56:39.240]  She flattened the $1 million worth house next door.
[3:56:39.240 --> 3:56:39.920]  What did she do?
[3:56:39.920 --> 3:56:43.360]  Did she build a migrant center, a little refugee camp on there?
[3:56:43.360 --> 3:56:47.280]  No, she did it to extend her garden.
[3:56:47.280 --> 3:56:51.280]  OK, so now Mike Zernovich, who's been on this show,
[3:56:51.280 --> 3:56:56.720]  has offered to pay the cost of up to 100 migrants, refugees,
[3:56:56.720 --> 3:57:00.560]  the plane cost so they can travel to the United Kingdom
[3:57:00.560 --> 3:57:04.680]  and be housed in JK Rowling's many mansions
[3:57:04.680 --> 3:57:07.360]  where she has many spare bedrooms.
[3:57:07.360 --> 3:57:09.360]  Is she going to take up the offer?
[3:57:09.360 --> 3:57:11.200]  Well, I wonder.
[3:57:11.200 --> 3:57:14.160]  You know, people like Gary Lineker, again,
[3:57:14.160 --> 3:57:17.920]  a famous TV host, vastly wealthy, continually
[3:57:17.920 --> 3:57:21.240]  virtue signals about accepting Syrian refugees
[3:57:21.240 --> 3:57:24.320]  as accepted precisely zero himself.
[3:57:24.320 --> 3:57:28.400]  Bob Geldof, vastly wealthy musician,
[3:57:28.400 --> 3:57:32.320]  virtue signaled about taking in Syrian refugee families.
[3:57:32.320 --> 3:57:36.840]  Two years later, he's taken in precisely zero.
[3:57:36.840 --> 3:57:40.200]  Lily Allen, virtue signals about how the UK must
[3:57:40.200 --> 3:57:43.360]  take in more Syrian migrants, children,
[3:57:43.360 --> 3:57:46.280]  even though they look literally 40 years old when they arrive
[3:57:46.280 --> 3:57:48.160]  but were told their children.
[3:57:48.160 --> 3:57:49.920]  She virtue signals about it, calls
[3:57:49.920 --> 3:57:52.080]  anyone who disagrees with her a racist.
[3:57:52.080 --> 3:57:53.400]  Where does Lily Allen live?
[3:57:53.400 --> 3:57:56.760]  Oh, she lives in the Cotswolds, one of the wealthiest,
[3:57:56.760 --> 3:57:59.120]  whitest areas of Britain.
[3:57:59.120 --> 3:58:00.960]  And it's always the same way.
[3:58:00.960 --> 3:58:03.880]  These people never have to deal with the effects
[3:58:03.880 --> 3:58:05.720]  of mass immigration themselves.
[3:58:05.720 --> 3:58:09.160]  That's always left to the poor working class peasants
[3:58:09.160 --> 3:58:12.840]  while they virtue signal to us from their ivory towers
[3:58:12.840 --> 3:58:15.280]  about how we're mean and racist for not allowing
[3:58:15.280 --> 3:58:19.920]  in more refugees while they just sit back and tweet about it.
[3:58:19.920 --> 3:58:22.120]  Well, JK Rowling, I think it's time
[3:58:22.120 --> 3:58:24.080]  that you put your money where your mouth is,
[3:58:24.080 --> 3:58:26.040]  that you actually stood up for your principles
[3:58:26.040 --> 3:58:29.600]  and accepted housing of Syrian refugees.
[3:58:29.600 --> 3:58:30.920]  We're gonna have more on that in future.
[3:58:30.920 --> 3:58:32.920]  That's gonna wrap it up for the Alex Jones show.
[3:58:32.920 --> 3:58:34.960]  Alex will be back 11 to two tomorrow.
