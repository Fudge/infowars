[00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:09.771]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.771 --> 00:00:11.352]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.352 --> 00:00:12.893]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.893 --> 00:00:17.095]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.095 --> 00:00:21.157]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.941 --> 00:00:38.286]  Well, fresh off of Dave Mustaine on the show yesterday with his official international response to saying the mass shootings could have been staged by the criminals that staged Fast and Furious.
[00:00:38.286 --> 00:00:42.588]  You know them as the Obama administration.
[00:00:44.107 --> 00:00:49.230]  And then we had Richard Belzer, along with Christopher Walken yesterday.
[00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.833]  On the heels of that, you can only go up one level, to quote Spinal Tap, from 10 to 11.
[00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:58.234]  They said, well why not just make it louder and make it 10?
[00:00:58.234 --> 00:00:59.235]  It's 11.
[00:00:59.235 --> 00:01:01.256]  And our 11 is Max Keiser.
[00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:02.817]  Alright, Max is a funny guy.
[00:01:02.817 --> 00:01:04.318]  I like him.
[00:01:04.318 --> 00:01:06.399]  You know, he'd be a nice, fun guy to hang around and drink beer with.
[00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:14.422]  But I shouldn't open the interview up joking around with him or that'll set the tone and then it'll disintegrate very rapidly with the two of us.
[00:01:14.422 --> 00:01:16.543]  And I am in a kind of a joking mood today.
[00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:18.784]  Don't ask me why.
[00:01:18.784 --> 00:01:19.764]  Well, actually, I know why.
[00:01:19.764 --> 00:01:21.625]  All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
[00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:26.427]  I actually got to go wakeboarding yesterday evening with some friends that took me out.
[00:01:26.427 --> 00:01:27.848]  I want to thank them for that.
[00:01:29.685 --> 00:01:30.606]  And I feel energized.
[00:01:30.606 --> 00:01:32.667]  I feel like I was on a week-long vacation.
[00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:35.890]  Now I have many vacations, three-hour periods every once in a while.
[00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.154]  So we're going to be talking about the big news with Max Keiser.
[00:01:41.154 --> 00:01:54.725]  When we come back from break, we're going to get into the talk of QE3, the rapidly deteriorating situation since we had him on a week ago, less than a week ago, doing nothing to MF Global, what precedent this sets.
[00:01:54.725 --> 00:01:57.547]  We're going to talk about it all with Max Keiser today.
[00:01:59.056 --> 00:02:02.577]  And we're also going to look at a bunch of the different military developments and more.
[00:02:02.577 --> 00:02:05.738]  And the new combat robots to occupy our cities.
[00:02:05.738 --> 00:02:10.779]  Pentagon developing autonomous humanoid robots to perform evacuation operations like Katrina.
[00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:12.820]  That means gun confiscations.
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.380]  So talk about Skynet.
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.200]  It's here.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.321]  And police departments are getting Homeland Security blimps.
[00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:27.088]  It's all very nice, so it's all part of, well, it's all part of our tax money and the playing army on the disheveled, overtaxed American people.
[00:02:27.088 --> 00:02:29.210]  But it's the same thing worldwide happening.
[00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.033]  Max Keiser, tell us, tell us what's front and center on your plate.
[00:02:32.033 --> 00:02:34.995]  We're going to come back and launch the official interview here.
[00:02:34.995 --> 00:02:44.543]  Max Keiser, syndicated radio host, TV host, maxkeiser.com, a one-stop shop for all things financial crystal ball gazing.
[00:02:44.543 --> 00:02:45.484]  Good to have you here with us.
[00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:48.126]  Hey, Alex, great, great to be with you.
[00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:59.679]  And just continuing on the theme that we established a few months ago, just trying to pick the exact date of when you have this global fiat money collapse.
[00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:04.485]  I've said April of next year is the outside chance of that happening anytime between now and then.
[00:03:04.485 --> 00:03:05.686]  And just try to
[00:03:06.607 --> 00:03:12.951]  Figure out where the seismic shocks are in the system, what will trigger the event.
[00:03:12.951 --> 00:03:15.493]  So I'm looking at a couple of different things.
[00:03:15.493 --> 00:03:20.616]  And as I mentioned on the last show, I've done some more work looking into Japan.
[00:03:21.937 --> 00:03:30.606]  You know, Japan is a very interesting country because they funded 20 years of stagnant economic development with their savings accounts.
[00:03:30.606 --> 00:03:37.173]  So people in Japan are almost forced to buy Japanese government bonds.
[00:03:37.173 --> 00:03:40.596]  But now, demographically, these people are retiring, so they have to sell.
[00:03:41.457 --> 00:03:43.599]  To fund their retirement.
[00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.962]  So that means a guarantee upward move in interest rates.
[00:03:46.962 --> 00:03:53.607]  That could be the trigger that starts a global cascading effect in the entire.
[00:03:53.607 --> 00:04:00.173]  What got me started on this is because it just emerged this past week, Alex, that the second biggest buyer of U.S.
[00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:02.975]  Treasury debt now is no longer China.
[00:04:02.975 --> 00:04:04.316]  Number one, of course, is America.
[00:04:04.316 --> 00:04:06.398]  America is the biggest buyer of its own debt.
[00:04:06.658 --> 00:04:09.579]  But taking the second spot now is Japan.
[00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.599]  China is walking away from the table.
[00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.100]  Japan has always been under the Treasury of America's thumb.
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.941]  They'll do whatever America says.
[00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:20.501]  And now they are the number two biggest buyer of U.S.
[00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:21.121]  Treasury bonds.
[00:04:21.121 --> 00:04:25.222]  But that is extremely dangerous because their economy itself is a tinderbox.
[00:04:25.222 --> 00:04:31.784]  Probably the weakest, most fragile economy in the world after the Fukushima disaster, after 20 years of the zombie economy and the zombie banks.
[00:04:31.784 --> 00:04:32.544]  But now they are
[00:04:32.944 --> 00:04:33.825]  Supporting America.
[00:04:33.825 --> 00:04:36.787]  Japan, the zombie economy, is supporting the American economy.
[00:04:36.787 --> 00:04:39.389]  Give you an idea of how fragile the system is.
[00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.251]  China is walking away.
[00:04:41.251 --> 00:04:43.693]  What is China buying with the money that they have?
[00:04:43.693 --> 00:04:46.255]  Well, it's turned out that they are buying gold.
[00:04:46.255 --> 00:04:55.703]  My sources tell me that China, before the end of this year, will come out with an official statement announcing that they've upped their gold by over a thousand tons.
[00:04:55.703 --> 00:04:56.364]  Stay there, stay there.
[00:04:56.364 --> 00:04:58.986]  We're going to come right back with all things economic.
[00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:06.197]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[00:05:06.197 --> 00:05:09.159]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:14.544]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[00:05:14.544 --> 00:05:17.807]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business.
[00:05:17.967 --> 00:05:19.508]  Blowing up your food prices.
[00:05:19.508 --> 00:05:27.151]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[00:05:27.151 --> 00:05:31.012]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[00:05:31.012 --> 00:05:32.793]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[00:05:32.793 --> 00:05:36.815]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[00:05:36.815 --> 00:05:39.436]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[00:05:39.716 --> 00:05:42.498]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[00:05:42.498 --> 00:05:47.062]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food costs.
[00:05:47.062 --> 00:05:47.703]  Don't wait!
[00:05:47.703 --> 00:05:50.165]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash alex.
[00:05:50.165 --> 00:05:53.147]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash alex.

[00:06:00.686 --> 00:06:06.671]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[00:06:06.671 --> 00:06:12.255]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[00:06:12.255 --> 00:06:14.517]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[00:06:14.517 --> 00:06:22.003]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[00:06:22.503 --> 00:06:26.304]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[00:06:26.304 --> 00:06:30.645]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[00:06:30.645 --> 00:06:37.527]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[00:06:37.527 --> 00:06:40.568]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[00:06:40.568 --> 00:06:43.669]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:47.390]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.871]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[00:06:50.412 --> 00:06:55.521]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:57.184]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[00:07:00.126 --> 00:07:10.757]  The Silver Lungs Generator is the only all-encompassing professional class product for producing endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[00:07:10.757 --> 00:07:20.968]  With recent regulations threatening the sale of silver-based supplements, now you can secure yourself and your family by producing your own silver solutions anywhere, anytime.
[00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:29.453]  You can have the peace of mind knowing that you can create endless supply of silver anytime, anywhere, for any application.
[00:07:29.453 --> 00:07:36.656]  The Silver Lungs Generator is a one-time purchase that requires no maintenance nor replacement parts for the life of the unit.
[00:07:36.656 --> 00:07:41.438]  This product was designed to be an invaluable part of your vital preparations.

[00:08:04.912 --> 00:08:09.734]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:09.734 --> 00:08:11.335]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.335 --> 00:08:12.876]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.876 --> 00:08:17.057]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.057 --> 00:08:22.200]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:33.145]  Well, if true, it signals one of the biggest, stinking, ugliest, mange-covered,
[00:08:34.738 --> 00:08:35.249]  Rats!
[00:08:36.582 --> 00:08:45.369]  Fat on the blood of dead children, and criminal wars, and tyranny worldwide, and fat off the blood of all they killed with Arkansas.
[00:08:45.369 --> 00:09:01.363]  Hillary Clinton, one of the king rats, the Washington Examiner, DrudgeReport.com, are reporting, or Drudge is linked to it, because technically he's not reporting, that she is set to not be his VP, because they want to get rid of Biden.
[00:09:01.363 --> 00:09:05.126]  I mean, that's admitted after Biden came out.
[00:09:06.408 --> 00:09:09.469]  And so they want to put basically chains on black people.
[00:09:09.469 --> 00:09:11.730]  Hillary rejected VP slot.
[00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.092]  Be ready your own 2016 run.
[00:09:14.092 --> 00:09:18.994]  And go ahead and go to the examiner, you know, let's show people if they're watching on Prison Planet on TV.
[00:09:18.994 --> 00:09:30.819]  And it goes on, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was pressed by her husband and a top Obama aide to consider replacing Vice President Joe Biden just a couple of weeks ago.
[00:09:30.819 --> 00:09:34.261]  Claims the author of the New York Times bestseller, The Amateur.
[00:09:35.544 --> 00:09:35.764]  I don't
[00:09:50.307 --> 00:09:55.390]  I'm not going to go the route of their talk show host saying it's not that big of a deal.
[00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.391]  They use it as a weapon.
[00:09:56.391 --> 00:09:57.712]  Let's use the word.
[00:09:57.712 --> 00:10:00.393]  It doesn't matter with the political correctness.
[00:10:00.393 --> 00:10:08.638]  They can say that stuff to get everybody fighting with each other and to inject racial division, divide and conquer, and then it's cute and sweet.
[00:10:08.638 --> 00:10:14.702]  Yeah, you can show the Cruz like, can we even show the headline?
[00:10:14.702 --> 00:10:15.643]  He's allowed to say it.
[00:10:16.567 --> 00:10:24.093]  To try to create race war, but then we, the evil whitey, exactly, we're bad.
[00:10:24.093 --> 00:10:25.894]  And again, it isn't a black-white thing.
[00:10:25.894 --> 00:10:27.035]  These people know this.
[00:10:27.035 --> 00:10:29.217]  They're engaging in class warfare.
[00:10:29.217 --> 00:10:32.419]  They're just literally pimping out racial conflict.
[00:10:32.419 --> 00:10:34.981]  It's unbelievable.
[00:10:34.981 --> 00:10:38.364]  Those black leaders, make sure those black babies get aborted, 51% of them.
[00:10:40.319 --> 00:10:41.879]  So we're going to be going over all of that.
[00:10:41.879 --> 00:10:42.880]  But that's enough.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.240]  Coming up in about 25 minutes, we're going to open the phones up.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:58.604]  In fact, they're open now for your questions for former top stockbroker, retired author, researcher, who's done BBC shows, syndicated radio, RT, Press TV, he does that every week.
[00:10:58.604 --> 00:11:00.124]  Max Keiser was on with us Friday.
[00:11:00.124 --> 00:11:01.724]  No, no, last Sunday.
[00:11:01.724 --> 00:11:03.165]  Now he's on with us this Friday.
[00:11:03.165 --> 00:11:03.605]  It is
[00:11:04.525 --> 00:11:09.388]  The 17th day of August 2012 on this Friday edition.
[00:11:09.388 --> 00:11:13.171]  This is teleprompter free radio slash TV.
[00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:14.672]  Talking point free as well.
[00:11:14.672 --> 00:11:15.632]  We just cover it.
[00:11:15.632 --> 00:11:17.274]  Well, like I see it, my guests see it.
[00:11:17.274 --> 00:11:19.015]  That's why sometimes we have differing views with guests.
[00:11:19.015 --> 00:11:22.557]  We're not monolithic liberal show, monolithic conservative show.
[00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:23.258]  I'm into freedom.
[00:11:23.258 --> 00:11:24.478]  I'm into an open debate.
[00:11:24.478 --> 00:11:26.500]  I'm into getting people to think for themselves.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.721]  I think you deserve more than talking points.
[00:11:28.721 --> 00:11:29.942]  I think you're smart.
[00:11:29.942 --> 00:11:33.204]  I think when I tell you all this scary stuff, you'll make preparation for it.
[00:11:33.204 --> 00:11:34.305]  I don't tell you this stuff to scare you.
[00:11:35.186 --> 00:11:36.347]  I think you're like me.
[00:11:36.347 --> 00:11:37.768]  I think you want to know the truth.
[00:11:37.768 --> 00:11:40.070]  The truth's always there anyways.
[00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:46.256]  If you didn't know the elevator didn't actually come when the doors opened, and you step out and go, well, I don't see an elevator.
[00:11:46.256 --> 00:11:48.458]  I see a 100-floor shaft.
[00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:49.078]  But you know what?
[00:11:49.078 --> 00:11:50.600]  I just feel like I'll step on in there.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.281]  I'm going to be positive.
[00:11:52.281 --> 00:11:53.482]  I don't want to be scared.
[00:11:53.482 --> 00:11:55.724]  And then you'd fall 100 floors and die.
[00:11:55.724 --> 00:11:59.088]  And you'll bounce at the bottom and splat everywhere like Sloppy Joe's on the highway.
[00:12:00.523 --> 00:12:02.165]  That's what we're talking about here.
[00:12:02.165 --> 00:12:03.687]  Okay, the elevator doors have opened.
[00:12:03.687 --> 00:12:04.709]  There is no elevator.
[00:12:04.709 --> 00:12:06.211]  Do not walk into it.
[00:12:06.211 --> 00:12:08.995]  But people are like lemmings falling off the edge of the cliff.
[00:12:10.461 --> 00:12:12.342]  After all, Gloria Steinem says it's cool.
[00:12:12.342 --> 00:12:16.124]  I mean, she is CIA after all, which means banker, banker-occupier.
[00:12:16.124 --> 00:12:18.766]  Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com joins us.
[00:12:18.766 --> 00:12:21.487]  He's also the inventor of the virtual trading system.
[00:12:21.487 --> 00:12:23.308]  He's with the Hollywood Stock Exchange.
[00:12:23.308 --> 00:12:26.750]  He was on with us Sunday, and now things have really deteriorated.
[00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:30.413]  Fox News, AP, Reuters, they're all talking about global collapse.
[00:12:30.413 --> 00:12:32.314]  Banks prepared for collapse.
[00:12:32.314 --> 00:12:35.335]  Banks told prepare for collapse.
[00:12:35.335 --> 00:12:35.736]  We've been
[00:12:36.696 --> 00:12:40.259]  Now told, and China has announced, the government's pulling out of the U.S.
[00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:42.760]  stock market, saying it's fraudulent.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.942]  That's what Max has been saying.
[00:12:44.942 --> 00:12:51.506]  George Soros and others rushing in to buy gold, getting completely out of the market, even privately.
[00:12:51.506 --> 00:12:53.888]  They stopped managing people's money years ago.
[00:12:53.888 --> 00:12:56.750]  What does all of this signify?
[00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:59.432]  For those of us watching, the writing's on the wall.
[00:13:00.072 --> 00:13:02.914]  Massive war, total collapse.
[00:13:02.914 --> 00:13:04.996]  Can it be averted?
[00:13:04.996 --> 00:13:12.581]  Max, when you say collapse on the outside by next April at the latest, are you saying that it will happen?
[00:13:12.581 --> 00:13:13.962]  Is there any way to avert it?
[00:13:13.962 --> 00:13:15.483]  What does the collapse look like?
[00:13:15.483 --> 00:13:16.704]  Max Keiser, you have the floor.
[00:13:17.691 --> 00:13:27.360]  Yeah, I'm saying that it's a 90% chance of collapse by next April, but it could happen at any time between now and April.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:33.686]  The global economy, you have to look at it in terms of the way a systems analyst would look at any complicated system.
[00:13:33.686 --> 00:13:41.313]  Every time you add more to the system, the complexity doesn't rise in a linear fashion, it rises exponentially.
[00:13:42.013 --> 00:13:58.399]  So every time the Fed puts on more quantitative easing, every time investment banks bail out some other investment bank, every time more derivatives are released into the system, you don't go from, let's say, 700 trillion in notional value derivatives to 800 trillion in a linear way.
[00:13:58.399 --> 00:14:05.101]  You have to think of it in terms of this global quadrillion to two quadrillion derivative souffle.
[00:14:06.581 --> 00:14:10.144]  Being encumbered with exponentially more risk.
[00:14:10.144 --> 00:14:12.686]  This is classic systems analysis.
[00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:17.489]  Because we no longer have an economy of supply and demand, of output, of factories, of wages.
[00:14:17.489 --> 00:14:21.372]  We've left that world 40 years ago when we went off the gold standard in 1971.
[00:14:21.372 --> 00:14:26.236]  By the way, this is the 41st anniversary of the closing of the gold window on August 15, 1971, by Richard Nixon.
[00:14:28.157 --> 00:14:32.280]  But all this time since then, we've been building in the complexity, building in the debt.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.763]  And so now, between now and April of next year is my call.
[00:14:35.763 --> 00:14:39.146]  You're going to have complete systemic collapse, much worse than in 2008.
[00:14:39.146 --> 00:14:45.672]  2008 was just a precursor to what will be a complete and utter breakdown.
[00:14:46.292 --> 00:15:01.558]  And just so the game here is to try to pick where it starts, what the trigger and to kind of study it in terms of how the economies rattle and roll as a result of this complete and utter systemic breakdown.
[00:15:01.558 --> 00:15:06.320]  As I mentioned, Japan, to me, seems like the weakest link in the chain.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:12.723]  Once that goes, it's the one of the top three armies in the world, the second biggest creditor behind the US itself, the US debt.
[00:15:13.243 --> 00:15:19.009]  And they just have a lot of awful demographic and economic trends going against them.
[00:15:19.009 --> 00:15:23.935]  So look more locally, Alex, to follow up on a story you've been talking about for a few weeks.
[00:15:23.935 --> 00:15:27.959]  The fraud that is Facebook, Groupon, and Zynga.
[00:15:27.959 --> 00:15:28.980]  I want to add something to that.
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.203]  And you said on this show, let me just interrupt to get the number out, 800-259-9231.
[00:15:34.446 --> 00:15:37.167]  800-259-9231.
[00:15:37.167 --> 00:15:38.868]  Call's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:15:38.868 --> 00:15:40.069]  Max, I hate to toot your horn.
[00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:45.271]  I just want to point out, mainstream media gets it wrong most of the time beforehand because they're lying.
[00:15:45.271 --> 00:15:46.212]  They have an agenda.
[00:15:46.212 --> 00:15:50.254]  You keep getting it right, and our guests do, because you know what's happening.
[00:15:50.254 --> 00:15:57.717]  But expanding on this, you said six months ago, well before this, you said Facebook was going to be a giant pump and dump.
[00:15:57.717 --> 00:15:59.918]  Everybody who knew what was going on knew that.
[00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:01.719]  And now they get away with this.
[00:16:01.719 --> 00:16:03.140]  But Martha Stewart goes to jail.
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:03.440]  Go ahead.
[00:16:04.406 --> 00:16:04.886]  Right.
[00:16:04.886 --> 00:16:14.030]  It's a pop-and-dump scandal, which you'd see on Wall Street 20 years ago on the penny stock firms.
[00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:18.012]  You know, they're very famous companies back then who were big in the penny stock.
[00:16:18.012 --> 00:16:22.714]  And they would call people up on the phone and get them to buy stock while they themselves were selling the stock.
[00:16:22.714 --> 00:16:28.076]  And then suddenly there were no more sellers and the stock would collapse and the insiders made out like bandits.
[00:16:28.076 --> 00:16:29.557]  Now, this is the first time we've seen it.
[00:16:30.117 --> 00:16:30.737]  I don't know.
[00:16:50.789 --> 00:16:51.990]  Zynga and Groupon.
[00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:57.772]  Groupon is a stock that went public at 20, traded near 30, is now at 5.
[00:16:57.772 --> 00:17:00.693]  And Zynga is down 60 or 70, 80% as well.
[00:17:00.693 --> 00:17:07.136]  What all these three companies have in common, this is a dimension that hasn't been touched on a lot, is that they all share a common auditor.
[00:17:07.136 --> 00:17:08.476]  Ernst & Young.
[00:17:08.476 --> 00:17:11.117]  Ernst & Young is one of the biggest auditors in America.
[00:17:11.117 --> 00:17:12.018]  They are crooked.
[00:17:12.018 --> 00:17:13.458]  They are as crooked as Wall Street.
[00:17:13.458 --> 00:17:15.459]  They are as crooked as the fund managers.
[00:17:15.459 --> 00:17:17.340]  They are as crooked as the rating agencies.
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.921]  And explain how this works.
[00:17:19.921 --> 00:17:22.383]  It's not just that they're crooked and cook the books.
[00:17:22.383 --> 00:17:33.829]  Only certain groups like Arthur Anderson and others who are politically connected with Justice Department people in a revolving door, only you go to them, not for them to cook the books even really.
[00:17:33.829 --> 00:17:34.949]  That's on the surface.
[00:17:34.949 --> 00:17:41.033]  It's really a payoff to regulators who are in a revolving door to let you be above the law.
[00:17:41.834 --> 00:17:44.659]  Well, Arthur Anderson is one of the biggest accounting firms.
[00:17:44.659 --> 00:17:46.823]  They got caught up in Enron.
[00:17:46.823 --> 00:17:49.548]  Enron blew up, and Arthur Anderson disappeared.
[00:17:49.548 --> 00:17:52.653]  There were ten or so big firms at one point.
[00:17:52.653 --> 00:17:53.695]  I think we're down to four now.
[00:17:53.695 --> 00:17:55.137]  But am I correct in what I said?
[00:17:56.509 --> 00:18:16.185]  Ernst & Young is not necessarily hired to cook the books because the system is so corrupt that there is no genuine, generally accepted accounting principles worth anything anymore.
[00:18:16.185 --> 00:18:19.708]  Ernst & Young, they cover these three companies that I just mentioned.
[00:18:19.708 --> 00:18:22.871]  They have just lost, in total, these three companies alone.
[00:18:22.871 --> 00:18:24.492]  The market caps have dropped by $62 billion.
[00:18:26.313 --> 00:18:29.477]  In the past just a few months and it's going public.
[00:18:29.477 --> 00:18:36.425]  And just to give you an idea of what Ernst & Young does, what these big accounting firms do, I had an experience myself when I was CEO of a company in Los Angeles.
[00:18:36.425 --> 00:18:39.649]  We had one of these big accounting firms come in, PricewaterhouseCooper.
[00:18:39.649 --> 00:18:43.853]  And they, the trick is basically, it depends on what they call revenue.
[00:18:44.714 --> 00:18:55.663]  In the case of Zynga, that they sell virtual tractors and they sell virtual raspberries as part of Farmville, which is a game on Facebook.
[00:18:55.663 --> 00:18:58.385]  The Urmson Young would count the virtual money as real money.
[00:18:58.385 --> 00:19:00.087]  So that was the fraud that they were committing.
[00:19:00.547 --> 00:19:07.792]  In the case of the company I was involved with, PricewaterhouseCoopers, they were identifying losses as revenue.
[00:19:07.792 --> 00:19:09.633]  We had $2 million in losses.
[00:19:09.633 --> 00:19:13.755]  They put in the filing for the IPO of Bear Stearns, $2 million in revenues.
[00:19:13.755 --> 00:19:17.618]  According to their formula, that was the revenues of the company, even though
[00:19:18.218 --> 00:19:19.699]  They were the losses of the company.
[00:19:19.699 --> 00:19:33.046]  But they didn't get in trouble after that, because the accounting rules in America, just like all the banking rules and all the political rules and all the special interest rules and all the abrogation of all the civil rights and all the constitutional rules, are now in the hands of the lunatics running this asylum.
[00:19:33.046 --> 00:19:36.568]  They're the ones, Ernst & Young can say, that losses equals revenues.
[00:19:37.388 --> 00:19:39.690]  And therefore, the company is worth $100 billion.
[00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:44.733]  Then it goes to the public market, and within three months we know, wait a minute, the company's not worth $5.
[00:19:44.733 --> 00:19:45.573]  Sure, Max, stay there.
[00:19:45.573 --> 00:19:48.695]  When we come back, I want to get your take on this then.
[00:19:48.695 --> 00:19:56.881]  If the whole thing is rotten, and as you said, the whole structure is the rust, take the rust out of the car, there's no car, what happens when there is an implosion?
[00:19:56.881 --> 00:19:57.781]  Is it total?
[00:19:57.781 --> 00:19:58.702]  Does it make it worse?
[00:20:00.256 --> 00:20:06.763]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[00:20:06.763 --> 00:20:09.365]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[00:20:09.365 --> 00:20:14.751]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[00:20:14.751 --> 00:20:19.436]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[00:20:19.696 --> 00:20:27.363]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[00:20:27.363 --> 00:20:31.227]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[00:20:31.227 --> 00:20:33.009]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[00:20:33.009 --> 00:20:37.032]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we have all known this was coming.
[00:20:37.032 --> 00:20:39.655]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.

[00:20:42.697 --> 00:20:47.279]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[00:20:47.279 --> 00:20:47.920]  Don't wait!

[00:23:37.998 --> 00:23:38.779]  This capitalism?
[00:23:38.779 --> 00:23:45.063]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:23:45.063 --> 00:23:45.924]  Hi, Ted Anderson.

[00:24:24.992 --> 00:24:29.956]  And now they're buying 1.4 billion bullets.
[00:24:29.956 --> 00:24:33.398]  They've got drones and checkpoints going up everywhere.
[00:24:33.398 --> 00:24:37.161]  And more and more they admit it's for a civil unrest collapse.
[00:24:37.161 --> 00:24:43.726]  Max Keiser, who's been stunningly accurate in his prediction so far, unfortunately, is saying in the next
[00:24:45.717 --> 00:24:46.098]  I don't know.
[00:24:46.098 --> 00:24:47.159]  How far away is April?
[00:24:47.159 --> 00:24:49.823]  3, 4, 5, 6, 7 months.
[00:24:49.823 --> 00:24:50.584]  6, 7 months.
[00:24:50.584 --> 00:24:52.747]  He sees it all imploding.
[00:24:52.747 --> 00:24:57.533]  And now they're in Fox News saying it looks like the Fed is going to go to QE3.
[00:24:57.533 --> 00:25:00.257]  But they've already done other forms of stimulus that cause inflation.
[00:25:01.258 --> 00:25:04.942]  Max, what happens when the corruption is so systemic?
[00:25:04.942 --> 00:25:11.770]  I mean, if we had crashes in 1929, not much of the economy was tied up in the market.
[00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:15.855]  What happens when everything's tied up in fraud if things go belly up?
[00:25:17.312 --> 00:25:23.254]  Well, it's a good point, because back in the 20s and 30s, you still had a very big farming component in the U.S.
[00:25:23.254 --> 00:25:26.855]  economy, and even during the Depression, there was enough family farms in America.
[00:25:26.855 --> 00:25:28.716]  People could eat to some degree.
[00:25:28.716 --> 00:25:30.316]  That's not so anymore.
[00:25:30.316 --> 00:25:35.258]  You have the big industrial farming, the Monsanto farming, the huge conglomerate farming.
[00:25:35.258 --> 00:25:37.199]  You don't really have the small farms anymore.
[00:25:37.199 --> 00:25:39.680]  So when the thing blows up, there's no recourse.
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.560]  There's nowhere to go back.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.861]  I'll make another prediction for 2013.
[00:25:42.861 --> 00:25:45.182]  You keep asking me, is there any way to stop it?
[00:25:45.182 --> 00:26:03.432]  I say, no, there's no way to stop this, because systems analysis tells me that when you complicate a system to the degree that this has been compromised and complicated, there's a 99.9% probability of a total, utter systemic collapse before April, and that's my thought.
[00:26:03.432 --> 00:26:04.893]  Now, following up on that,
[00:26:05.273 --> 00:26:09.554]  There is only one possible outcome as a result of that, and that's civil war.
[00:26:09.554 --> 00:26:11.055]  There's got to be a civil war.
[00:26:11.055 --> 00:26:14.856]  It's going to be a civil war in America, intergenerational.
[00:26:14.856 --> 00:26:31.721]  All the people under 30 are going to go to war with everybody who's 45 plus, who basically stole all their money, stole their country, stole their wealth, destroyed the arability and the viability of the soil, and that will be the civil war.
[00:26:31.721 --> 00:26:33.262]  There's only, if you have one,
[00:26:33.922 --> 00:26:38.043]  You're going to have the other, and that would come in 2013.
[00:26:38.043 --> 00:26:43.204]  Max, I'm so speechless I've got to interject something here.
[00:26:43.204 --> 00:26:48.806]  This is shaking me right now, because I know you wouldn't just say this and put your credibility on the line.
[00:26:48.806 --> 00:26:52.807]  You're really sure of this, and I hope you're wrong.
[00:26:52.807 --> 00:26:53.647]  That's all I can say.
[00:26:54.414 --> 00:27:01.776]  Well, I'm putting my flag, you know, planting my flag on this one, as I have done before with predictions previously.
[00:27:01.776 --> 00:27:10.419]  And there's, because there's no avoiding the collapse, there's no remedy to the collapse.
[00:27:10.419 --> 00:27:11.919]  The underlying chaos
[00:27:12.319 --> 00:27:15.840]  Is too great.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.182]  86% of all the trades in the New York Stock Exchange are computer to computer.
[00:27:19.182 --> 00:27:21.322]  That's true of exchanges all over the world.
[00:27:21.322 --> 00:27:26.404]  The algorithms that support all this trading are funded with 0% interest rates from the Fed.
[00:27:26.404 --> 00:27:28.105]  They can borrow money at zero.
[00:27:28.105 --> 00:27:31.887]  They can do anything they want with any amount of money that they want.
[00:27:31.887 --> 00:27:35.488]  If they ever make a mistake, they get bailed out with more free money from the Feds.
[00:27:35.828 --> 00:27:40.369]  They keep adding layer and layer and layer of problems on the system.
[00:27:40.369 --> 00:27:42.890]  We already had the flash crash in 2010.
[00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:47.291]  We had the entire evisceration of night capital just a couple of weeks ago.
[00:27:47.291 --> 00:27:51.512]  $440 million in 45 minutes due to a spastic computer program.
[00:27:51.512 --> 00:27:52.992]  Here's why you may be right.
[00:27:52.992 --> 00:27:59.754]  I mean, undoubtedly, it's all a giant fraud waiting to blow up, Max, but why are the Chinese pulling out of the U.S.
[00:27:59.754 --> 00:28:00.274]  stock market?
[00:28:01.067 --> 00:28:02.027]  They're buying gold.
[00:28:02.027 --> 00:28:05.248]  They're buying every... This is going to be another surprise announcement, Gal.
[00:28:05.248 --> 00:28:13.331]  They're going to come out before the end of the year and say that their gold holdings are not at roughly 1,000 tons, but they're closer to 2,000 tons.
[00:28:13.331 --> 00:28:17.592]  They may even be up toward 3,000 tons, which would put them right up with Germany.
[00:28:17.592 --> 00:28:21.574]  Number two biggest concentration of gold in the world is Germany with 3,000 tons, then the U.S.
[00:28:21.574 --> 00:28:22.014]  with 8,000 tons.
[00:28:22.014 --> 00:28:22.554]  China?
[00:28:25.475 --> 00:28:27.376]  Big surprise announcement coming this year.
[00:28:27.376 --> 00:28:31.679]  They're either going to double, probably double their gold to 2,000 tons.
[00:28:31.679 --> 00:28:33.680]  It'll shock the world.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:40.304]  It'll put a whole nother wave of buying pressure on gold, which we still see is going to continue.
[00:28:40.304 --> 00:28:44.047]  It's climbed to $5,000, $6,000, $7,000 an ounce.
[00:28:44.047 --> 00:28:46.248]  And China is a big part of that.
[00:28:46.248 --> 00:28:49.510]  As you mentioned, Soros is now back in gold in a big way.
[00:28:50.831 --> 00:28:51.251]  Well, yeah.
[00:29:11.562 --> 00:29:13.503]  Well, I mean, that's what the Chinese said.
[00:29:13.503 --> 00:29:20.264]  They said Monday, I mean, of course, you were just mentioning earlier, they said this system doesn't work, it's not real.
[00:29:20.264 --> 00:29:28.767]  In fact, I had the article, I forget their exact statement, but they, we'll try to find it during the break, but they were like, you know, this system is no longer, we can't gauge this.
[00:29:28.767 --> 00:29:31.768]  They basically said it wasn't real.
[00:29:31.768 --> 00:29:34.008]  Exactly what you're saying, Max.
[00:29:34.008 --> 00:29:35.769]  Yeah, I know, they listen to my show.
[00:29:37.429 --> 00:29:38.771]  They listen to reality, I'm sure.
[00:29:38.771 --> 00:29:39.952]  And they probably do listen to you.
[00:29:39.952 --> 00:29:43.075]  We'll be right back with Max Keiser and your phone calls.
[00:29:43.075 --> 00:29:44.217]  And he's got a lot more to cover.
[00:29:44.217 --> 00:29:49.482]  Stay with us.
[00:29:49.482 --> 00:29:50.864]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.864 --> 00:29:53.407]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.407 --> 00:29:56.070]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.097 --> 00:30:05.598]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:30:05.598 --> 00:30:08.019]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:30:08.019 --> 00:30:17.121]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:30:17.121 --> 00:30:20.561]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:30:20.561 --> 00:30:22.242]  There's no priming required.
[00:30:22.242 --> 00:30:24.522]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[00:30:24.522 --> 00:30:27.023]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:30:28.183 --> 00:30:29.604]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:30:29.604 --> 00:30:31.025]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:30:31.025 --> 00:30:34.186]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:30:34.186 --> 00:30:37.588]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:30:37.588 --> 00:30:39.489]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[00:30:39.489 --> 00:30:41.711]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:30:41.711 --> 00:30:44.452]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:30:44.452 --> 00:30:46.033]  It's what my family uses.
[00:30:46.033 --> 00:30:49.335]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[00:30:49.335 --> 00:30:55.198]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[00:30:55.198 --> 00:30:56.339]  You can also call to order.
[00:30:56.459 --> 00:30:56.499]  888-253-3139
[00:31:17.412 --> 00:31:22.637]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:31:22.637 --> 00:31:24.960]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.764]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:31:29.764 --> 00:31:30.885]  And here's the best part.
[00:31:30.885 --> 00:31:33.949]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:31:33.949 --> 00:31:37.232]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:31:37.552 --> 00:31:40.735]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:31:40.735 --> 00:31:42.957]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:31:42.957 --> 00:31:43.918]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:31:43.918 --> 00:31:44.158]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:31:44.158 --> 00:31:47.541]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:31:47.541 --> 00:31:49.282]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:31:59.531 --> 00:32:06.057]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[00:32:06.057 --> 00:32:08.659]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[00:32:08.659 --> 00:32:14.044]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[00:32:14.044 --> 00:32:18.728]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[00:32:19.008 --> 00:32:26.652]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[00:32:26.652 --> 00:32:30.514]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[00:32:30.514 --> 00:32:32.295]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[00:32:32.295 --> 00:32:36.317]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[00:32:36.317 --> 00:32:38.938]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[00:32:39.218 --> 00:32:42.001]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[00:32:42.001 --> 00:32:46.565]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food costs.
[00:32:46.565 --> 00:32:47.225]  Don't wait!
[00:32:47.225 --> 00:32:49.107]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:32:49.107 --> 00:32:50.688]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:32:50.688 --> 00:32:52.210]  You can bet your life on efoodsdirect.
[00:33:03.029 --> 00:33:04.930]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:06.312]  A lie!
[00:33:06.312 --> 00:33:08.313]  No man is obsolete!
[00:33:08.313 --> 00:33:10.194]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[00:33:10.194 --> 00:33:13.437]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[00:33:13.437 --> 00:33:18.901]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[00:33:18.901 --> 00:33:26.127]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth, a crawling insect, an ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[00:33:26.747 --> 00:33:28.248]  I am a human being!
[00:33:28.248 --> 00:33:35.972]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind!
[00:33:35.972 --> 00:33:37.132]  I don't care!
[00:33:37.132 --> 00:33:38.173]  I tell you, I don't care!
[00:33:38.173 --> 00:33:39.733]  I'm a human being!
[00:33:39.733 --> 00:33:40.234]  I exist!
[00:33:41.317 --> 00:33:47.443]  If I speak one thought aloud, that thought lives, even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[00:33:47.443 --> 00:33:50.606]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[00:33:50.606 --> 00:33:58.294]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength, when you have no strength at all!
[00:33:58.294 --> 00:34:03.579]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and the state has no use for your kind!
[00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:09.413]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:34:09.413 --> 00:34:11.414]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:34:11.414 --> 00:34:20.880]  Alright, we're going back to Max Keiser because I want to ask him what the collapse he's predicting will look like.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:28.945]  I mean, he's saying worse than 08 and that was a heart attack in the financial system orchestrated to hold us hostage and bring in control.
[00:34:28.945 --> 00:34:30.066]  How bad will this one be?
[00:34:31.203 --> 00:34:41.747]  Because Paulson, the Secretary of the Treasury, threatened martial law, and we first reported that with a congressman on the show, who heard it and closed committee, and people thought I made it up, and a week later it was big national news.
[00:34:41.747 --> 00:34:43.468]  We got no credit, of course.
[00:34:43.468 --> 00:34:44.848]  And it's not that that even matters.
[00:34:44.848 --> 00:34:53.252]  I'm just tired of people doubting what I have a congressman on, or, you know, I have somebody interesting on, and people just can't believe it was even real.
[00:34:54.821 --> 00:34:56.922]  I mean, it had like Willie Nelson on.
[00:34:56.922 --> 00:34:59.384]  People don't believe I had Christopher Walken on yesterday.
[00:34:59.384 --> 00:35:03.006]  I mean, they don't believe that the truth has been successful.
[00:35:03.006 --> 00:35:04.728]  They just can't get it through their heads.
[00:35:04.728 --> 00:35:08.830]  They're playing games with themselves, not us that are awake.
[00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:12.333]  We're going to go back and ask them that question in a moment, and go to your phone calls.
[00:35:12.333 --> 00:35:15.135]  Max Keiser, maxkeiser.com is our guest.
[00:35:15.135 --> 00:35:17.376]  If you just joined us again, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:35:17.376 --> 00:35:20.198]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.

[00:35:31.265 --> 00:35:33.586]  I mean, it's in-depth.
[00:35:33.586 --> 00:35:36.808]  If you like this radio show and the info, then you're going to love the television show.
[00:35:36.808 --> 00:35:37.888]  It's very informative.
[00:35:37.888 --> 00:35:42.291]  The guests, the in-studio, the documents, the mini-documentaries.
[00:35:42.291 --> 00:35:42.931]  That's 15 cents a day.
[00:35:45.165 --> 00:35:45.225]  Yes.
[00:36:02.063 --> 00:36:11.575]  Superfoods out there just incredible vitamin minerals Trace element things like beyond tangy tangerine discounted at Infowarsteam.com.
[00:36:11.575 --> 00:36:16.881]  That's Infowarsteam.com Tomorrow we're launching Infowarshealth.com a new site
[00:36:17.779 --> 00:36:17.899]  Yeah.
[00:36:48.029 --> 00:36:49.170]  Okay, I gotta ask you Max Keiser, what
[00:37:17.415 --> 00:37:19.196]  What then does a collapse look like?
[00:37:19.196 --> 00:37:24.780]  I mean, you're going out there big time, and I find it chilling because I respect your analysis.
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:31.063]  When you say collapse, some people then say that means road warrior, you know, bands of motorcycles feeding on people.
[00:37:31.063 --> 00:37:32.504]  Well, crime rates are already exploding.
[00:37:32.504 --> 00:37:35.446]  There are a lot of towns where there are no police.
[00:37:35.446 --> 00:37:39.508]  Or if there are, they're there to make sure you don't have guns, or they are the gangs.
[00:37:39.508 --> 00:37:44.912]  So we're starting to see some road... Chicago, most dangerous city in the world now, but obviously
[00:37:46.271 --> 00:37:51.633]  By collapse, you don't mean full Road Warrior collapse, or how bad could it get?
[00:37:51.633 --> 00:38:09.160]  Well, first of all, before I get into that, I wanted to touch on some news here about the extent to which this fraud has perpetrated itself throughout the economy and why people are going to continue to be outraged and why that anger is building.
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.681]  Remember, John Corzine
[00:38:11.081 --> 00:38:19.264]  Former head of Goldman Sachs, former governor of New Jersey, he was caught when he moved over to MS Global, stealing 1.2 billion dollars.
[00:38:19.264 --> 00:38:21.244]  We talked about it on your show before.
[00:38:21.244 --> 00:38:25.286]  Now, he is basically allowed to go scot-free.
[00:38:25.286 --> 00:38:28.146]  There's no penalty at all for John Corzine.
[00:38:28.146 --> 00:38:32.668]  His defense, his defense is that the money vaporized.
[00:38:33.248 --> 00:38:42.985]  He has no idea where it went and he just can't seem to be able to generate any evidence of its whereabouts that are ever existed or where it went.
[00:38:43.897 --> 00:38:51.979]  That's the kind of outrageous statement coming from a former governor, former head of Goldman Sachs, former head of MF Global, that gets under people's skin.
[00:38:51.979 --> 00:38:53.219]  And they say, wait a minute.
[00:38:53.219 --> 00:38:56.759]  This guy is part of a racket.
[00:38:56.759 --> 00:39:04.141]  The racket of the rating agencies, the fund managers, Wall Street, the auditors, as we just talked about, the media, CNBC.
[00:39:04.141 --> 00:39:06.421]  And it's a mafia-style racket.
[00:39:06.421 --> 00:39:08.382]  They're practicing racketeering.
[00:39:08.382 --> 00:39:09.942]  And they are stealing.
[00:39:10.302 --> 00:39:14.445]  Wholesale our wealth and by proxy our country.
[00:39:14.445 --> 00:39:37.942]  At some point there is a breaking point and the most victimized group in America will be the new generation that wakes up one day and finds gasoline at $15 a gallon, a bag of groceries for $300, and no way to get to work because the roads are completely in disrepair, and on and on and on.
[00:39:38.442 --> 00:39:44.884]  And those people will have no recourse whatsoever but to take back their country by any means necessary.
[00:39:44.884 --> 00:39:50.145]  It's just, it's not a big leap of faith here, this is just a logical progression of what happened.
[00:39:50.145 --> 00:39:59.028]  That's right, and the bankers are gearing up with 1.4 billion plus rounds of ammo, checkpoints, giant armored tanks, vehicles, admitting they're going to put the army on the street.
[00:39:59.028 --> 00:40:05.769]  What's the army going to do when their wife can't, you know, with her paycheck, pay for groceries, or mama's thrown out on the street?
[00:40:05.769 --> 00:40:07.450]  I mean, what are these bankers thinking?
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:15.283]  Well, you know, when you say it won't be like road warriors, you know, it could be like, you know, a soft gulag.
[00:40:15.283 --> 00:40:16.343]  A soft gulag.
[00:40:16.343 --> 00:40:25.966]  And what I mean by that would be, on one hand, you've got this massive private prison industry that's growing the fastest, one of the fastest growing industries in America is private prisons.
[00:40:25.966 --> 00:40:28.527]  Corrections Corps of America hitting new all-time highs on their stock.
[00:40:28.527 --> 00:40:29.467]  We talked about it recently.
[00:40:29.467 --> 00:40:36.210]  And still put all the people in the new FEMA camps where they're there for petty reasons, making things, further driving down wages.
[00:40:37.391 --> 00:41:00.386]  Well, and prison labor, since we talked last time, it's come out that factory owners in America are complaining to the Chamber of Commerce because the prison labor now, which works for 80 to 90 cents a day, is becoming such a big component of the American labor force that the only way you can get a job in America now is to go to prison, to find yourself in prison.
[00:41:00.386 --> 00:41:06.270]  And so the manufacturers, the factories in America, they don't have anybody to hire because the people...
[00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:17.180]  Look at the crime wave in France, the riots, the crime wave in Greece, and they've disarmed most of the people, so the criminals are just robbing, and it says the police can't help.
[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:20.463]  Yeah, because it turns out the cops are the ones robbing a lot of people.
[00:41:20.463 --> 00:41:21.724]  I mean, this can only go on so long.
[00:41:24.286 --> 00:41:30.910]  All right, so my idea of the soft gulag is, first of all, you have the hard gulag, which are the prisons and the, you know, the camps.
[00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:44.238]  And we know, we see that being telegraphed in the stock market already, because the capitalization of those companies is moving aggressively higher, because they know that they're about to get 20, 30, 40, 50 million new inmates, and that's incredibly profitable.
[00:41:44.238 --> 00:41:46.139]  They get huge tax abatements.
[00:41:46.139 --> 00:41:50.062]  They get, they own the restaurants and hotels near the prisons, so people go visit their
[00:41:50.362 --> 00:41:54.684]  Family in prison, they eat in the restaurants, they stay in the hotels, they lose their voting rights.
[00:41:54.684 --> 00:41:55.825]  It's a fantastic money center.
[00:41:55.825 --> 00:42:01.127]  But the soft gulag, we saw that last week with the introduction of face deals.
[00:42:01.127 --> 00:42:07.310]  You know, these new Facebook cameras in retail shops that are geared to face recognition.
[00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:11.733]  And you get discounts by giving up your liberties and freedoms, but that's only up front.
[00:42:11.733 --> 00:42:14.114]  Later, everyone will have to do it to buy and sell.
[00:42:14.634 --> 00:42:20.936]  Right, so, in other words, you give up your liberties and freedoms for a deal on some Chinese-made garbage.
[00:42:20.936 --> 00:42:29.059]  So you get 20 cents off, and you'll allow Facebook to essentially keep you in check, keep you in line.
[00:42:29.059 --> 00:42:40.363]  Whenever you go into a mall or a shopping environment, and of course they'll hook it up to the grid, which includes every camera out there, you will be buzzed on your cell phone whenever you stray off the path.
[00:42:40.823 --> 00:42:51.406]  If you stray toward a retailing outlet that they don't want you to go to or doesn't have the deal that they want you to look at, you'll get buzzed, you'll get phoned, you'll start... Yeah, this is how they control markets.
[00:42:51.406 --> 00:42:54.726]  We've got to go to calls because I promised to, but new documents.
[00:42:54.726 --> 00:42:58.067]  Big Sis lied about canceling mobile body scanner program.
[00:42:58.067 --> 00:43:00.888]  They're now rolling out giant... they have the army doing this.
[00:43:01.748 --> 00:43:16.517]  We have footage on local news from New York where they make you and your family drive under a high-powered x-ray machine that shoots through metal, more powerful than a chest x-ray, and they're still rolling it out.
[00:43:16.517 --> 00:43:20.219]  New documents, Big Sis lied about canceling mobile body scanner program.
[00:43:20.219 --> 00:43:23.701]  Homeland Security claimed it had dropped the plans in early stage.
[00:43:23.701 --> 00:43:28.204]  We've got the local newscast showing the idiot police and military
[00:43:28.724 --> 00:43:38.508]  Standing out there under high-powered, guys show people this article it's incredible, under giant high-powered x-ray machines that shoot through your car or your truck.
[00:43:38.508 --> 00:43:40.589]  I mean this is suicide!
[00:43:40.589 --> 00:43:48.753]  I mean these globalists are just setting up a system of total war against everybody with the GMO food, the radiation, the mass death.
[00:43:48.753 --> 00:43:51.054]  We are run by lunatics.
[00:43:51.454 --> 00:43:54.595]  The Gulag concept is coming into focus.
[00:43:54.595 --> 00:44:00.497]  And Facebook, by the way, also is introducing online gambling in the UK with British pounds.
[00:44:00.497 --> 00:44:06.638]  So that member I called the Gulag Casino, which is going to, people will give up their liberties also for a chance to gamble online.
[00:44:06.638 --> 00:44:10.800]  Of course, they hold out these enormous mega multimillion dollar pots of money.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:12.600]  We're good to go.
[00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:42.732]  Well, thanks for taking my call, Brother Alex.
[00:44:42.732 --> 00:44:44.973]  Mr. Kaiser, good to talk to you.
[00:44:44.973 --> 00:44:50.477]  My question is, I can't really afford gold, and obviously it's going to go way up.
[00:44:50.477 --> 00:45:00.185]  Do you think silver would be a good investment for somebody who can't afford gold, or do you just, at this point, just invest in... You're talking to Mr. Silver right now, Max.
[00:45:00.985 --> 00:45:03.826]  Yeah, silver, of course, they call it the poor man's gold.
[00:45:03.826 --> 00:45:06.488]  It's basically the same thing as owning gold.
[00:45:06.488 --> 00:45:08.169]  It'll operate the same thing.
[00:45:08.169 --> 00:45:11.730]  You know, gold and silver now, more and more, are being considered a currency.
[00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:21.095]  The CME in Chicago, the Commodity Mercantile Exchange, just announced today that they are accepting gold as collateral.
[00:45:21.095 --> 00:45:24.577]  That means for the first time now, these commodity futures operations
[00:45:25.377 --> 00:45:26.998]  Or part of the banking system.
[00:45:26.998 --> 00:45:34.562]  They are so distrustful of the banks themselves that they are violating this idea that gold is somehow not a money.
[00:45:34.562 --> 00:45:36.163]  They're saying now gold is a currency.
[00:45:36.163 --> 00:45:37.643]  We will take gold as collateral.
[00:45:37.643 --> 00:45:39.824]  So gold is seeping its way into the economy.
[00:45:39.824 --> 00:45:42.246]  It's being monetized slowly but surely.
[00:45:43.226 --> 00:45:46.947]  Only thing that's going to be left standing, 5,000 years of history will tell you that.
[00:45:46.947 --> 00:45:49.628]  Silver is just as good as gold in this environment.
[00:45:49.628 --> 00:45:54.170]  If you don't want to buy pure silver, you can buy junk silver, which is 90% silver.
[00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:58.292]  You know, the 1964 or previous... Everybody knows what those coins are.
[00:45:58.292 --> 00:46:03.353]  And when all this paper fully goes down, people are going to still be transacting.
[00:46:03.353 --> 00:46:12.537]  It's going to be whiskey, cigarettes, silver, gold, bullets, firearms, food, people that know how to fix things, trades.
[00:46:13.557 --> 00:46:15.537]  I mean, that's where it's at.
[00:46:15.537 --> 00:46:27.160]  Yeah, well, Stacey, my fiancée, soon-to-be wife, you know, she has thousands of these miniature bottles of whiskey from the airplanes that she's going to use as currency, she says.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:34.621]  By the way, Max, yeah, I've got a bunch of whiskey and stuff, obviously not drinking it, but I'm joking, but I do have a bunch of whiskey and stuff.
[00:46:34.621 --> 00:46:37.662]  I mean, I know that there's a good chance all this is going to happen.
[00:46:37.662 --> 00:46:39.822]  I hope it doesn't, but sir, I hope that answers your question.
[00:46:41.066 --> 00:46:41.547]  It does.
[00:46:41.547 --> 00:46:43.728]  And one quick follow-up.
[00:46:43.728 --> 00:46:46.129]  What would that do with a person with a mortgage?
[00:46:46.129 --> 00:46:53.734]  I mean, if the dollar tanks and you owe your mortgage in dollars, I mean, how does that affect the average homeowner?
[00:46:53.734 --> 00:46:55.775]  Well, sometimes... Max, you answer it.
[00:46:55.775 --> 00:46:56.196]  Go ahead.
[00:46:56.716 --> 00:47:03.139]  Well, theoretically, you inflate the mortgage value away and it's quote-unquote good for the homeowner.
[00:47:03.139 --> 00:47:12.163]  But I think we're in an environment where there's so much economic dislocation and there's so many other variables at play here that it's not worth it.
[00:47:12.763 --> 00:47:13.724]  In that sense.
[00:47:13.724 --> 00:47:15.705]  But you mean your point is well taken.
[00:47:15.705 --> 00:47:16.325]  It's a good point.
[00:47:16.325 --> 00:47:18.646]  But there are other things to consider.
[00:47:18.646 --> 00:47:23.388]  And real estate as a class of investment is problematic for a number of reasons.
[00:47:23.388 --> 00:47:26.210]  You know, you have the society breaking down.
[00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:32.393]  You don't know what different neighborhoods today could suddenly become war zones next week.
[00:47:32.393 --> 00:47:34.334]  You know, there's a lot of things happening.
[00:47:34.334 --> 00:47:35.454]  But your point is well taken.
[00:47:35.454 --> 00:47:36.335]  It's a good point.
[00:47:36.335 --> 00:47:38.236]  And I can't, you know, say it's not a good point.
[00:47:38.596 --> 00:47:40.018]  All right, thank you so much, sir.
[00:47:40.018 --> 00:47:42.300]  Let's go to Jay in Texas.
[00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:44.102]  You're on the air, Jay.
[00:47:44.102 --> 00:47:45.303]  Hey, how you doing, Max?
[00:47:45.303 --> 00:47:51.370]  Hey, there's an article out in Veterans Today about foreign cash disqualifies Romney from presidential bid.
[00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:54.613]  Something about him being over in Israel and Italy or London.
[00:47:54.613 --> 00:47:55.775]  Do you know anything about that?
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:58.802]  I haven't seen that specific, that particular article.
[00:47:58.802 --> 00:48:04.445]  You know, Romney, of course, is problematic for a number of different reasons.
[00:48:04.445 --> 00:48:10.469]  You know, the whole Bain Capital affiliation and everything that goes on there.
[00:48:10.469 --> 00:48:19.936]  I don't understand why people would want to look at a guy who said his tax rate for the past five years is averaging about 13 percent.
[00:48:19.936 --> 00:48:24.239]  So clearly he's not in the same country that we are living in.
[00:48:24.239 --> 00:48:25.520]  He lives in some other country.
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:26.100]  He's a foreigner.
[00:48:26.981 --> 00:48:31.308]  No, he lives in global country where the globalists are all above the law.
[00:48:31.308 --> 00:48:33.231]  He can't really consider him to be an American.
[00:48:33.231 --> 00:48:36.176]  He pays taxes like he lives in the Cayman Islands.
[00:48:36.176 --> 00:48:38.780]  So go to the Cayman Islands and leave us alone!
[00:48:40.117 --> 00:48:41.178]  Yeah, I hear you.
[00:48:41.178 --> 00:48:46.741]  You certainly had courage to live in France, and now you're going to the tax haven, as they call it, of England, Max.
[00:48:46.741 --> 00:48:49.383]  Let's go to Mark in North Carolina.
[00:48:49.383 --> 00:48:50.043]  You're on the air.
[00:48:50.043 --> 00:48:51.204]  Go ahead.
[00:48:51.204 --> 00:48:53.505]  Hey Alex, Max, thanks for taking my call.
[00:48:53.505 --> 00:48:56.687]  And doggone, you answered several of my questions while I was sitting here waiting.
[00:48:56.687 --> 00:49:05.613]  But I still have one good one, I think, and that's got to do with whether you've got oil or aerospace or other items, including the silver and the gold.
[00:49:05.613 --> 00:49:09.155]  Once you have it, what's the best ways or what's the best and safest bet for keeping
[00:49:09.747 --> 00:49:13.148]  Well, I mean, number one, don't tell anybody about it but your spouse.
[00:49:13.148 --> 00:49:16.189]  Number two, have guns to defend it and be ready to use them.
[00:49:16.189 --> 00:49:19.470]  And number three, don't put all your eggs in one basket, Max Keiser.
[00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:24.831]  Well, my understanding is that InfoWars is opening up a huge warehouse down in Austin, Texas to store everybody's precious metals.
[00:49:24.831 --> 00:49:27.652]  That's where I send all mine!
[00:49:27.652 --> 00:49:28.372]  Very funny, Max.
[00:49:30.256 --> 00:49:31.056]  No, okay.
[00:49:31.056 --> 00:49:37.579]  So, yes, you don't want, obviously, you're at risk if you have it in your home or you know it.
[00:49:37.579 --> 00:49:41.141]  There's a lot of work on the web in terms of what people are doing with this.
[00:49:41.141 --> 00:49:49.665]  Personally, there are services that you can get involved with that store your metals in vaults that are completely outside the banking system.
[00:49:50.505 --> 00:49:59.796]  I mean, there's all sorts of private lockers, safety deposit boxes aren't 100% safer, but the point is, if you've got a couple of them, you can always get the stuff out later.
[00:49:59.796 --> 00:50:02.399]  So, I mean, just all over the place is basically it.
[00:50:03.212 --> 00:50:07.933]  This common sense, you know, you're right to be concerned.
[00:50:07.933 --> 00:50:11.074]  From there, there are a number of strategies you can use.
[00:50:11.074 --> 00:50:20.376]  Each one has pluses and minuses, but tied to your individual circumstance, which I don't know, but it's easy enough to get the research on this.
[00:50:20.376 --> 00:50:26.218]  Yeah, I'm also, I'm investing in lead and the systems that project it.
[00:50:26.218 --> 00:50:29.779]  And I'm also, food and things like that.
[00:50:30.868 --> 00:50:47.372]  Well, yeah, but, you know, the funny thing is Portugal just announced that the folks there that are being exposed to austerity measures have just run out of all the gold that they can sell at the local pawn shop to swap.
[00:50:47.372 --> 00:50:51.913]  No, I know, I know, absolutely, and the bankers drove the price down to hoard it themselves.
[00:50:51.913 --> 00:50:53.314]  More calls straight ahead.
[00:50:53.314 --> 00:50:56.734]  Logan, John, Terry, Scott, your calls straight ahead.
[00:50:56.734 --> 00:50:58.915]  Stay with us, I'm Alex Jones with Max Geiser.
[00:51:01.863 --> 00:51:08.047]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[00:51:08.047 --> 00:51:13.151]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[00:51:13.151 --> 00:51:15.333]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[00:51:15.333 --> 00:51:22.618]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[00:51:23.118 --> 00:51:26.819]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[00:51:26.819 --> 00:51:31.080]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:37.742]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[00:51:37.742 --> 00:51:40.723]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[00:51:40.723 --> 00:51:43.704]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[00:51:43.704 --> 00:51:47.345]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[00:51:47.345 --> 00:51:49.766]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[00:51:50.286 --> 00:51:55.269]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[00:51:55.269 --> 00:52:00.252]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.

[00:52:04.134 --> 00:52:05.175]  That bears repeating.
[00:52:05.175 --> 00:52:09.057]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.

[00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:33.151]  Aids in controlling yeast infections.

[00:52:59.681 --> 00:53:04.442]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[00:53:04.442 --> 00:53:06.543]  I want you to know some very important information.
[00:53:07.459 --> 00:53:16.431]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[00:53:16.431 --> 00:53:21.358]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[00:53:56.184 --> 00:53:57.465]  Protect your immune system.
[00:53:57.465 --> 00:53:58.506]  It's the only one you've got.
[00:54:05.903 --> 00:54:10.247]  Basically, an offshore criminal class has gotten control.
[00:54:10.247 --> 00:54:13.731]  They fund themselves by militarizing against us.
[00:54:13.731 --> 00:54:16.033]  They make money out of enslaving us.
[00:54:16.033 --> 00:54:21.898]  They brainwash people to be paranoid and think their neighbors are terrorists, while the government runs Al Qaeda publicly.
[00:54:21.898 --> 00:54:24.100]  It is an insane time to be alive.
[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:28.284]  Max Keiser is our guest for this little segment, and the next, and then in studio.
[00:54:28.885 --> 00:54:31.886]  We're going to have Joe Bannister and his lawyer, political prisoner.
[00:54:31.886 --> 00:54:34.127]  They tried to make him a political prisoner.
[00:54:34.127 --> 00:54:35.787]  Joe Bannister, former Treasury agent.
[00:54:35.787 --> 00:54:39.669]  This is very important in light of all the corruption for the IRS coming out.
[00:54:39.669 --> 00:54:42.490]  Logan in California, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:54:43.317 --> 00:54:45.098]  Nice to talk to you, AJ.
[00:54:45.098 --> 00:54:48.539]  Remember, apathy is treason, my brother.
[00:54:48.539 --> 00:55:04.724]  My question for Max Keiser is, I don't hear anybody speaking about commercial real estate and the fact that you can only claim a loss on your business for five years before you have to declare bankruptcy.
[00:55:04.724 --> 00:55:09.566]  And I believe that that is going to be one of the trigger mechanisms for the next collapse because
[00:55:10.186 --> 00:55:14.988]  Housing real estate was the bubble that popped the first time.
[00:55:14.988 --> 00:55:18.409]  And so I wanted to know what you thought about that, Max.
[00:55:18.409 --> 00:55:20.689]  Well, all I can say is that I would agree with you.
[00:55:20.689 --> 00:55:22.670]  OK, what you're saying is absolutely correct.
[00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:32.613]  The commercial real estate sector is kind of a huge bubble proportions, just like the student loan sector is a huge multi, you know, trillion dollar plus bubble ready to burst as well.
[00:55:32.613 --> 00:55:34.834]  So there's still big bubbles yet to burst.
[00:55:36.144 --> 00:55:49.689]  Here in California, everywhere I look, strip malls, they have one business in ten units, and every single one of them has a for-rent sign, a for-sale sign, and they've been kidding for years.
[00:55:49.689 --> 00:55:52.290]  I have friends... Okay, let me jump in here.
[00:55:52.290 --> 00:55:53.530]  So think that through for a second.
[00:55:53.530 --> 00:55:58.772]  So in other words, you've got this commercial real estate that's vacant, that's not generating any income, it's backed by bonds,
[00:55:59.352 --> 00:56:05.960]  Collateralized bonds of some nature, mortgage collateralized bonds, which have been sold back and forth amongst banks.
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:10.365]  And those banks, when they sell those back and forth to each other, they value them for a hundred cents on the dollar.
[00:56:10.365 --> 00:56:13.189]  None of the banks yet have said, wait a minute, the strip malls are empty.
[00:56:13.189 --> 00:56:14.931]  Those bonds are not worth a hundred cents on the dollar.
[00:56:14.931 --> 00:56:16.292]  They're worth only five cents on the dollar.
[00:56:16.292 --> 00:56:17.254]  No one has done that yet.
[00:56:17.694 --> 00:56:18.734]  Well said, well said!
[00:56:46.946 --> 00:56:47.707]  Thank you, Logan.
[00:56:47.707 --> 00:56:48.367]  Gotta jump.
[00:56:48.367 --> 00:56:50.008]  Terry and Canada, you're on the air.
[00:56:50.008 --> 00:56:52.229]  Go ahead.
[00:56:52.229 --> 00:56:55.951]  Alex, Max, thank you very much, guys.
[00:56:55.951 --> 00:57:03.795]  I was first introduced to Max, Mike Maloney, and when he air-guitared the Sex Pistols, he had me hooked.
[00:57:03.795 --> 00:57:05.016]  So, my question is,
[00:57:06.216 --> 00:57:12.659]  Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney does double duty at the Bank of International Settlements.
[00:57:12.659 --> 00:57:16.921]  So my exact question is, is the Bank of Canada buying gold?
[00:57:16.921 --> 00:57:25.124]  And once this financial collapse happens, where does Canada fit into it all, being the biggest trader with the U.S.? ?
[00:57:26.428 --> 00:57:31.774]  Well, Carney's an interesting case because, of course, just six months ago, Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P.
[00:57:31.774 --> 00:57:37.561]  Morgan, was lecturing Carney on why he needs to reduce his minimum capital reserve requirements in that country.
[00:57:37.561 --> 00:57:41.586]  Because doesn't he know that selling more derivatives is in the best interest of all the bankers around the world?
[00:57:41.946 --> 00:57:42.226]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:56.923 --> 00:58:01.404]  They need to get rid of their Glass-Steagall because they've done that previously and got into trouble with it.
[00:58:01.404 --> 00:58:01.944]  Great points.
[00:58:01.944 --> 00:58:05.525]  We're going to come back in five more minutes with Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com.
[00:58:05.525 --> 00:58:08.586]  Again, if you've just tuned in, I'm Alex Jones of InfoWars.com.
[00:58:08.586 --> 00:58:12.766]  No, we're not dry, old, fake, left-wing media regurgitating fables.
[00:58:12.766 --> 00:58:15.927]  We're not old, dry, right-wing media regurgitating old fables.
[00:58:15.927 --> 00:58:19.268]  We're looking for real reality and freedom in our time.
[00:58:19.268 --> 00:58:20.468]  I hope Max Keiser's wrong.
[00:58:20.468 --> 00:58:22.409]  He says it's going to happen in the next six, seven months.
[00:58:22.409 --> 00:58:23.969]  By next April, total collapse.
[00:58:24.449 --> 00:58:28.230]  I hope he's wrong, but there's a good chance he's going to be right.
[00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:32.292]  The globalists could always have some new bubble, some new scam, some new thing they do.
[00:58:32.292 --> 00:58:34.593]  But Max has never said it's coming down now.
[00:58:34.593 --> 00:58:36.833]  He's saying that and a lot of our other experts are.
[00:58:36.833 --> 00:58:38.234]  That's super creepy.
[00:58:38.234 --> 00:58:42.996]  We're here warning people.
[00:58:42.996 --> 00:58:46.737]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.555 --> 00:58:54.039]  Supernatural silver is not an ionic or a colloidal silver.
[00:58:54.039 --> 00:59:00.024]  It is a nanocatalytic silver salt technology with superior benefits to the colloidal silvers of yesterday.
[00:59:00.024 --> 00:59:03.328]  This new molecular structure is permanently bonded to water.
[00:59:03.328 --> 00:59:09.654]  It is the only water-soluble silver that is 99% bioavailable and non-toxic with no known side effects.
[00:59:10.154 --> 00:59:18.139]  Silversol's patented technology has advanced antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties with a 15-year shelf life.
[00:59:18.139 --> 00:59:24.283]  It can be used internally as well as topically and is one of the most important items needed in any emergency.
[00:59:24.283 --> 00:59:31.028]  Independent testing from universities, hospitals, military, and private labs make this the most proven product in the industry.
[00:59:31.428 --> 00:59:33.990]  No silver solution is better or safer.
[00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:36.891]  Protect yourself and your loved ones and be prepared.

[00:59:55.461 --> 00:59:57.943]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:02.028 --> 01:00:06.849]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:06.849 --> 01:00:08.429]  You want answers?
[01:00:08.429 --> 01:00:10.350]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:10.350 --> 01:00:14.171]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:14.171 --> 01:00:19.412]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:19.412 --> 01:00:24.133]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Friday Worldwide Transmission.
[01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:29.973]  We've got five minutes left with Max Keiser.
[01:00:29.973 --> 01:00:32.055]  Invaluable information, maxkeiser.com.
[01:00:32.055 --> 01:00:33.896]  He knows we're having him on a lot more.
[01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:35.698]  We're very thankful for him coming on.
[01:00:35.698 --> 01:00:40.503]  You can find out about his TV and radio shows at maxkeiser.com.
[01:00:40.503 --> 01:00:42.985]  Be sure and support the alternative truthful media.
[01:00:42.985 --> 01:00:45.727]  It doesn't mean he has all the answers or I have all the answers.
[01:00:45.727 --> 01:00:48.950]  It doesn't mean we're infallible, nothing close to it, but we're trying.
[01:00:49.611 --> 01:00:50.652]  To get to the truth.
[01:00:50.652 --> 01:00:56.016]  And Max has really proven he's got his pulse for being a former insider on where things are going.
[01:00:56.016 --> 01:00:58.097]  And this conversation is freaking me out.
[01:00:58.097 --> 01:00:59.759]  I live here too.
[01:00:59.759 --> 01:01:03.742]  And I see all the preparations and I wish we weren't right.
[01:01:03.742 --> 01:01:05.963]  I just, man.
[01:01:05.963 --> 01:01:17.092]  Somehow we've got to turn this around and try to educate as many military and police as the globalists plan on having a civil war in this country that they trigger instead of having us come together and fixing the system.
[01:01:18.049 --> 01:01:18.751]  I'm not.
[01:01:29.966 --> 01:01:30.086]  Yeah.
[01:01:51.997 --> 01:01:53.778]  Hey, Max, Alex, good to talk to you guys.
[01:01:53.778 --> 01:01:58.081]  You know, I always enjoy listening to Max and you too, Alex.
[01:01:58.081 --> 01:02:01.964]  Just kind of wanted to tell you a little bit of what's going on here.
[01:02:01.964 --> 01:02:07.748]  I'm about two hours outside of Chicago, close to a little place called Gary, Indiana.
[01:02:07.748 --> 01:02:14.793]  I don't know if you guys know about it, but it's a cesspit, basically, just rampant crime.
[01:02:14.793 --> 01:02:21.237]  But what they're doing here is they're opening up, I should say, several churches
[01:02:21.237 --> 01:02:21.517]  I'm good.
[01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:40.251]  Yeah, like I said a couple days ago.
[01:02:40.251 --> 01:02:42.932]  Give us your take on that, Max.
[01:02:42.932 --> 01:02:48.594]  Well, Walmart is the company's store on the plantation.
[01:02:48.594 --> 01:02:52.776]  You know, every dollar you save at Walmart, you destroy $1.50 in wages.
[01:02:52.776 --> 01:02:57.058]  If you shop at Walmart, you're putting yourself into a wageless prison environment.
[01:02:57.058 --> 01:02:57.778]  It's as simple as that.
[01:02:57.778 --> 01:02:59.159]  Same thing with Target, though.
[01:02:59.159 --> 01:02:59.779]  They're all the same.
[01:03:00.834 --> 01:03:01.655]  Yeah, okay.
[01:03:01.655 --> 01:03:04.196]  But Walmart is the biggest employer in the United States.
[01:03:04.196 --> 01:03:10.761]  No, I mean, it wrote the book, but it's now even being slave-marted out worse by Amazon.
[01:03:10.761 --> 01:03:11.422]  Possibly.
[01:03:11.422 --> 01:03:16.285]  But, in other words, the retailing environment... Race to the bottom.
[01:03:16.285 --> 01:03:17.766]  Race to the bottom.
[01:03:17.766 --> 01:03:19.267]  Yeah, it's okay, the race to the bottom.
[01:03:19.267 --> 01:03:24.811]  I mean, if you want to segue into a discussion about guns, I mean, that's a different discussion.
[01:03:24.811 --> 01:03:26.092]  Yeah, but I mean, I was interrupting.
[01:03:26.092 --> 01:03:28.474]  Give us, in closing, your take on what's happening to retail.
[01:03:29.929 --> 01:03:33.230]  Well, no, it's the race to the bottom.
[01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:38.672]  You know, I was trying to come up with a good metaphor for this transition to this total collapse state.
[01:03:38.672 --> 01:03:44.955]  And, you know, you see it in nature all the time, Alex, you know, the transition in these system dynamics when there's a shift.
[01:03:44.955 --> 01:03:54.118]  You know, when you have water, for example, retains a lot of heat, and then suddenly it only takes one degree to go from water to vapor.
[01:03:54.118 --> 01:03:55.498]  Okay, that's a phase shift.
[01:03:57.259 --> 01:03:58.420]  And that's what I'm talking about.
[01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:03.163]  The heat, the water, the system is heating up as systems break down.
[01:04:03.163 --> 01:04:12.050]  And once we get that one final degree shift in complexity and outrage, you have a phase shift from water to steam.
[01:04:12.050 --> 01:04:16.053]  And steam, compared to water, is extremely, you know, unstable.
[01:04:16.053 --> 01:04:19.175]  And that's the society that we're heading for in 2013.
[01:04:19.175 --> 01:04:21.057]  Something extremely unstable.
[01:04:21.437 --> 01:04:35.447]  So when you say collapse, you mean lots of instability, crazy stuff going on, and the globalists know this shift's happening, so they want to flip it, like judo, and take all that rage and use it for them to take over, but you're saying you don't see things going well for them, or will they stay in control?
[01:04:35.447 --> 01:04:39.190]  I think they're in good shape, Alex.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:42.882]  We're going to have to have you back up very soon.
[01:04:42.882 --> 01:04:44.144]  Thank you so much, Max.
[01:04:44.144 --> 01:04:45.806]  I want to see where you think all this is going.
[01:04:45.806 --> 01:04:47.168]  Max Keiser has been our guest.
[01:04:47.168 --> 01:04:48.851]  We've got in-studio guests straight ahead.
[01:04:48.851 --> 01:04:52.075]  A guy that tried to make a political prisoner for his speech.
[01:04:52.075 --> 01:04:52.496]  Stay with us.
[01:04:58.271 --> 01:05:01.754]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[01:05:01.754 --> 01:05:07.678]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[01:05:07.678 --> 01:05:14.282]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[01:05:14.282 --> 01:05:19.966]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[01:05:19.966 --> 01:05:23.609]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[01:05:23.789 --> 01:05:27.592]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[01:05:27.592 --> 01:05:32.196]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[01:05:32.196 --> 01:05:34.698]  You'll also find it at infowarshop.com.
[01:05:34.698 --> 01:05:38.562]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[01:05:38.562 --> 01:05:42.986]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey.
[01:05:42.986 --> 01:05:45.628]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[01:05:45.928 --> 01:05:52.750]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:58.092]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshop.com.
[01:05:58.092 --> 01:06:03.594]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[01:06:03.594 --> 01:06:04.914]  Start purifying your water.
[01:06:05.034 --> 01:06:05.715]  We're good to go.
[01:06:26.078 --> 01:06:27.599]  Easy to set up and use.
[01:06:27.599 --> 01:06:29.019]  Doesn't require electricity.
[01:06:29.019 --> 01:06:32.181]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:06:32.181 --> 01:06:35.562]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:06:35.562 --> 01:06:39.704]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:06:39.704 --> 01:06:42.445]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:06:42.445 --> 01:06:44.025]  It's what my family uses.
[01:06:44.025 --> 01:06:47.347]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[01:06:47.347 --> 01:06:52.589]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[01:06:53.169 --> 01:06:58.712]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[01:06:58.712 --> 01:07:04.715]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[01:07:04.715 --> 01:07:10.298]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[01:07:10.298 --> 01:07:12.540]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:20.024]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[01:07:20.524 --> 01:07:24.327]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[01:07:24.327 --> 01:07:28.691]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[01:07:28.691 --> 01:07:35.557]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[01:07:35.557 --> 01:07:38.600]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.702]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[01:07:41.702 --> 01:07:45.446]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[01:07:45.446 --> 01:07:47.928]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[01:07:48.448 --> 01:07:53.550]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[01:07:53.550 --> 01:07:59.492]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[01:07:59.492 --> 01:08:06.114]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:06.114 --> 01:08:09.095]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:20.066 --> 01:08:28.537]  You know, I should have hyped this up better, but our listeners know that we tend to be all bite and no bark, as they say.
[01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:30.500]  We've had a lot of amazing guests in the last few days.
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.362]  We just had Max Keiser on yesterday.
[01:08:32.362 --> 01:08:34.925]  We had Richard Belzer along with...
[01:08:35.706 --> 01:08:41.171]  Christopher Walken and Dave Mustaine with an exclusive response to the big national story.
[01:08:41.171 --> 01:08:55.203]  So I'm really proud of the InfoWars radio slash TV show and I'm also very proud of my crew and the great work they're doing and the sponsors, the AM and FM affiliates, XM 166, everybody, our sponsors.
[01:08:55.203 --> 01:08:58.705]  We couldn't do this without you and it also shows that
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:01.542]  Liberty is popular.
[01:09:01.542 --> 01:09:09.287]  Now, I knew this because I'd followed the trial, and I think once even, maybe even tried to call you as a guest, but who knows.
[01:09:09.287 --> 01:09:19.595]  I didn't even really realize until I was sitting in here with Joe Bannister, who we had on earlier in the week via phone, and of course I've been interviewing now for about 14 years or so, or 13 years, which is about 99, right?
[01:09:19.595 --> 01:09:21.136]  So I guess about 13 years.
[01:09:22.957 --> 01:09:23.578]  I don't know.
[01:09:40.330 --> 01:09:44.193]  Joe Bannister for his thought crimes a few years ago.
[01:09:44.193 --> 01:09:52.498]  Mr. Bernhoff was able to get, I don't want to say get him off because he didn't do anything, but the point is it's hard to beat the criminal IRS.
[01:09:52.498 --> 01:09:53.539]  And I'm very excited.
[01:09:53.539 --> 01:09:54.179]  I didn't know this.
[01:09:54.179 --> 01:09:57.181]  I knew that you were, I guess in the Midwest or what was it, Milwaukee?
[01:09:57.461 --> 01:09:58.622]  Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Alex, yeah.
[01:10:28.081 --> 01:10:33.845]  Well, first of all, we came down to Austin, my firm did, because that's where all the troublemakers are, and we figured this is a good place to be.
[01:10:33.845 --> 01:10:36.466]  And that's partly true, but we're really liking it here in Austin.
[01:10:36.466 --> 01:10:41.329]  Great people, a lot of energy, and of course, this show is here, so we're having fun.
[01:10:42.119 --> 01:10:45.740]  Yeah, now that you're here in town, look out, you're our legal expert.
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:46.601]  Good to have you here.
[01:10:46.601 --> 01:10:47.221]  Thank you.
[01:10:47.221 --> 01:10:55.484]  In fact, I wanted to get you on the TV show tonight, so hopefully next time you're both in town, come back, because I forgot I'm shooting for a documentary film today, a film cruise here.
[01:10:55.484 --> 01:10:58.625]  So, we've got to work it out somehow to get that done.
[01:10:58.625 --> 01:11:00.245]  Okay, I'm excited, I'm going to shut up.
[01:11:02.126 --> 01:11:07.655]  Tell us about your take on the IRS, the big scandals coming out, all the rest of the corruption.
[01:11:07.655 --> 01:11:15.909]  It seems like the veil is lifting, that we really do have a corporate mafia in control that exempts itself from the fraudulent laws that they put in place.
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:25.027]  I think that's right, Alex, and one of the hot topics in academic commentators, the federal judiciary, and defense practitioners is government misconduct.
[01:11:25.027 --> 01:11:38.196]  After former Senator Ted Stevens and the subordination of perjury, falsification of evidence, and the scandal about that, what we're seeing, what I'm seeing now, is a cascade of investigative and prosecutorial misconduct that's infecting the courts.
[01:11:38.196 --> 01:11:42.239]  The difference now over the past four or five years is that it's being exposed to some extent.
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:54.308]  We will never know what sort of investigative or prosecutorial misconduct lay behind Joe's investigation and prosecution because we did not get all the discovery we were entitled to.
[01:11:54.308 --> 01:12:02.094]  But I remember getting the call from Joe after the arrest, and that was a traumatic time, I know, for him and his family.
[01:12:02.094 --> 01:12:05.977]  And we were able to jump in and help, and we're grateful to be able to do it.
[01:12:07.307 --> 01:12:15.691]  Let's go through that case before Wesley Snipes because, I mean, you're just winning and winning and winning in a system where it's almost impossible to win.
[01:12:15.691 --> 01:12:19.793]  Tommy Cryer, God bless him, died this year.
[01:12:19.793 --> 01:12:21.434]  He was able to defeat them.
[01:12:21.434 --> 01:12:25.076]  When you can get a jury trial, I mean, is that how you're able to do this, actually exposing the fraud?
[01:12:25.476 --> 01:12:25.956]  Absolutely.
[01:12:25.956 --> 01:12:34.640]  The last bastion of freedom, the interposition between government power and the executive and the citizens, citizens like Joe, is the jury.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:40.083]  Now there's, unfortunately, the quality of the jurors that we're seeing in jury pools
[01:12:41.224 --> 01:12:42.825]  It's a function of American culture.
[01:12:42.825 --> 01:12:46.849]  We have a lot of people that watch too much TV, that listen to government propaganda.
[01:12:46.849 --> 01:12:51.393]  It's very difficult to get free-thinking, individualist-type people on juries.
[01:12:51.393 --> 01:12:55.556]  So one of the things that you have to do is pay attention to your jury selection.
[01:12:55.556 --> 01:12:57.878]  Joe's jury, we like diversity on our juries.
[01:12:58.559 --> 01:13:00.340]  And, you know, I'll be candid about this.
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:08.245]  For example, the African-American community has a different perspective of the system than white America does generally.
[01:13:08.245 --> 01:13:10.046]  They've had an experience with the system.
[01:13:10.046 --> 01:13:11.927]  They're suspicious of system statements.
[01:13:11.927 --> 01:13:13.788]  Not as naive!
[01:13:13.788 --> 01:13:15.529]  That's a great way to put it.
[01:13:15.529 --> 01:13:21.913]  And they're more inclined to think and listen carefully to what otherwise other Americans might shut out.
[01:13:21.913 --> 01:13:26.296]  You know, how could it be that the government who wears the white hats indicts a good guy?
[01:13:26.756 --> 01:13:29.217]  Well, you know, the government comes into court with the white hats on.
[01:13:29.217 --> 01:13:30.978]  Joe's supposed to have the black hat on.
[01:13:30.978 --> 01:13:33.760]  And our trial theme was, no, they indicted the good guy.
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:36.061]  And so we tried to switch the hats.
[01:13:36.061 --> 01:13:38.642]  And that's a tough concept for most Americans.
[01:13:38.642 --> 01:13:43.285]  But thank God we still have jury trials in all of our criminal cases and unanimity is required.
[01:13:43.285 --> 01:13:47.607]  It's got to be 12 unanimous jurors giving a unanimous verdict.
[01:13:47.607 --> 01:13:48.948]  And that's your last chance.
[01:13:48.948 --> 01:13:51.149]  That's your last chance to defend yourself.
[01:13:51.149 --> 01:13:53.450]  The other thing that's going on, of course, is it's a
[01:13:54.571 --> 01:14:02.378]  An exemplar of despotic systems that they use their judicial process to single out and punish dissenters.
[01:14:02.378 --> 01:14:16.410]  That's always been the case throughout world history, but it's a real shame and it's a disgrace that the American federal criminal judicial process increasingly is being used as a forum to target and punish principled dissenters.
[01:14:16.410 --> 01:14:19.913]  And so that sets the state of the American judicial process today.
[01:14:20.595 --> 01:14:21.276]  Well, it's scary.
[01:14:21.276 --> 01:14:23.157]  It's like you say, Joe.
[01:14:23.157 --> 01:14:25.639]  Hey, I'm not saying don't pay them, even though it's all a fraud.
[01:14:25.639 --> 01:14:26.560]  They'll break your legs.
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:27.881]  I mean, they'll worse than that.
[01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:30.603]  They'll put you in prison for 20 years and take everything you got.
[01:14:30.603 --> 01:14:33.106]  I'd rather have my legs broken than that 10 times.
[01:14:33.106 --> 01:14:35.147]  I mean, this is vicious what you went through.
[01:14:35.147 --> 01:14:42.854]  I know most our listeners are aware of your story, but look at what happened to just the guest I had on the other day, the IRS.
[01:14:43.194 --> 01:14:43.956]  Yep, yep, yep.
[01:14:43.956 --> 01:14:45.098]  Sherry Peele Jackson.
[01:14:45.098 --> 01:14:46.902]  I mean, she did nothing wrong.
[01:14:46.902 --> 01:14:48.685]  And for her speech, look at Erwin Schiff.
[01:14:48.685 --> 01:14:51.050]  In prison for a book in America!
[01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:54.312]  Book burning, book burning is alive in America.
[01:14:54.312 --> 01:14:59.057]  We don't burn them anymore, we issue injunctions against their publication and dissemination.
[01:14:59.057 --> 01:15:03.321]  And that's what the court issued against Schiff prior to the criminal trial.
[01:15:03.321 --> 01:15:07.806]  The court enjoined Schiff from printing and publishing his book upon pain of contempt.
[01:15:07.806 --> 01:15:12.510]  I mean, it's interesting that even the Library Association of America came out in support of Schiff on that point.
[01:15:13.251 --> 01:15:29.906]  And it's also interesting that in an age where court decisions have said that free speech covers books on how to stalk, torture, and kill people, how to identify and groom children for sexual abuse, and that's free speech.
[01:15:29.906 --> 01:15:32.127]  You know, that stuff's out there, that's okay.
[01:15:32.127 --> 01:15:37.832]  But God forbid someone like Erwin Schiff wants to print his thoughts and research conclusions about the scope and nature of the tax.
[01:15:38.593 --> 01:15:40.255]  That's something, you burn the book.
[01:15:40.255 --> 01:15:46.521]  Well, I mean, he found the key to it and proved all their fraud after decades of research, and they said, you're going to a dungeon.
[01:15:46.521 --> 01:15:54.809]  Yeah, and the other speech, the other types of speech that, you know, I'm libertarian, but nevertheless, some of that speech is abhorrent.
[01:15:54.809 --> 01:15:57.312]  First Amendment covers that, but it doesn't cover Irwin.
[01:15:57.312 --> 01:16:00.315]  Yeah, you have to protect the abhorrent stuff or we lose our good stuff.
[01:16:00.735 --> 01:16:01.195]  That's right.
[01:16:01.195 --> 01:16:05.638]  You know, there was a famous Supreme Court Justice that made it really a great profound comment.
[01:16:05.638 --> 01:16:10.280]  We tolerate the speech we hate because someday our speech might be hated.
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:11.220]  So I'm good with that.
[01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:12.021]  I'm a libertarian.
[01:16:12.021 --> 01:16:13.982]  I believe in the principles of this country.
[01:16:13.982 --> 01:16:22.626]  But what we're having now is selective identification of speech that the state deems subversive, harmful, or dangerous.
[01:16:22.626 --> 01:16:27.669]  Back in the old days, frankly, we used to talk about our founders and the Middle Ages and then 1600s, 1700s.
[01:16:30.230 --> 01:16:33.411]  Oh, there was torture going on in terms of criminal punishment.
[01:16:33.411 --> 01:16:35.312]  And now we're so much more civilized.
[01:16:35.312 --> 01:16:36.873]  And I don't think that's the case.
[01:16:36.873 --> 01:16:40.975]  In fact... No, they just make it more sophisticated and more covers.
[01:16:40.975 --> 01:16:42.175]  There's more velvet gloves.
[01:16:42.175 --> 01:16:42.695]  That's right.
[01:16:42.695 --> 01:16:43.276]  What were you going to say?
[01:16:43.276 --> 01:16:43.776]  I interrupted.
[01:16:43.776 --> 01:16:46.357]  No, it has a perception of being more civilized.
[01:16:46.357 --> 01:16:56.121]  But in fact, if you were a heretic before in the colonies, you know, and you said something that they considered blasphemous, they'd put you in the stock for a day, a little public humiliation.
[01:16:56.841 --> 01:16:57.442]  We're good to go.
[01:17:17.535 --> 01:17:22.898]  Never having a trial, but he's in prison drugged for Medicare-Medicaid fraud, they claimed.
[01:17:22.898 --> 01:17:26.901]  I mean, now they drug you or electroshock you because of your views.
[01:17:26.901 --> 01:17:28.301]  That's like the old Soviet Union.
[01:17:28.301 --> 01:17:29.862]  It's barbaric.
[01:17:29.862 --> 01:17:31.403]  It's absolutely barbaric.
[01:17:31.403 --> 01:17:33.284]  And when you take a look at the U.S.
[01:17:33.284 --> 01:17:40.649]  sentencing guidelines, which determines sentencing ranges, and we take a look at the so-called white-collar guidelines, particularly regarding tax,
[01:17:41.289 --> 01:17:49.435]  And you have people that, you know, failed to pay a little bit of tax on a couple years of income, and the sentencing ranges can be five to ten years in federal prison.
[01:17:49.435 --> 01:17:50.916]  You know, everything is upside down.
[01:17:50.916 --> 01:17:57.061]  You can beat, you can be out of a state prison in California on a murder one charge, 6.9 years, something like that.
[01:17:57.061 --> 01:18:00.504]  You know, but if you run afoul of the IRS, look forward to a double-digit sentence.
[01:18:01.324 --> 01:18:02.905]  And this is systematic.
[01:18:02.905 --> 01:18:05.105]  This isn't accidental.
[01:18:05.105 --> 01:18:12.988]  This is absolute, intentional policy that's being passed by Congress, enforced by its agency, the Internal Revenue Service.
[01:18:12.988 --> 01:18:15.469]  This guy ought to have a radio show.
[01:18:15.469 --> 01:18:16.970]  No wonder he's winning with all these juries.
[01:18:19.051 --> 01:18:20.011]  Wow, amazing.
[01:18:20.011 --> 01:18:23.913]  Again, we have Joe Bannister and Robert G. Bernhoft, his incredible lawyer.
[01:18:23.913 --> 01:18:30.397]  You've got to go to BernhoftLaw.com because I've followed your cases and then I'm running around here with 20 things happening and you guys are here.
[01:18:30.397 --> 01:18:34.960]  And then it kind of re-clicks, you know, Joe goes, you know, he's the guy that's won all these other cases too.
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:37.441]  And I'm just realizing how rare that is.
[01:18:37.441 --> 01:18:40.323]  Why have you been so successful when very few others have?
[01:18:40.745 --> 01:18:42.687]  We're going to skip this break because it's so important, guys.
[01:18:42.687 --> 01:18:43.047]  Go ahead.
[01:18:43.047 --> 01:18:48.992]  Yeah, the conviction rate generally is around about body temperature in federal criminal trials.
[01:18:48.992 --> 01:18:51.434]  95-96% take your statistic.
[01:18:51.434 --> 01:18:57.999]  The way we approach these cases is, first of all, we have aggressive motion practice to get the discovery that our clients are entitled to.
[01:18:57.999 --> 01:19:02.003]  And there's various rules and cases, so we're very aggressive about getting discovery.
[01:19:02.003 --> 01:19:07.728]  And the devil's in the details, and the government's thematics, and sometimes investigative misconduct lurks in the discovery.
[01:19:08.508 --> 01:19:09.589]  Um, and then we prepare.
[01:19:09.589 --> 01:19:15.051]  It's about preparation, mastery of information, and it's also having an understanding of human nature.
[01:19:15.051 --> 01:19:17.232]  You know, this is an age where we want to change human nature.
[01:19:17.232 --> 01:19:18.852]  We don't want to acknowledge it.
[01:19:18.852 --> 01:19:27.836]  We acknowledge the functions of human nature, how it plays out, and, you know, court trials are theater dramatics where the stakes are very, very high.
[01:19:28.716 --> 01:19:31.739]  You have to understand what makes people tick when you pick a jury.
[01:19:31.739 --> 01:19:39.386]  You have to look at those people as individuals, ask them a few questions, and they will tell you things about themselves without even realizing it.
[01:19:39.386 --> 01:19:45.071]  So jury selection, and Joe assisted me at counsel table with jury selection in his trial.
[01:19:45.071 --> 01:19:50.556]  And you have to have good people instincts, and you have to be aggressive, and you have to know the law.
[01:19:50.556 --> 01:19:53.539]  But picking a jury is crucially important, as it was in Joe's case.
[01:19:55.171 --> 01:19:56.392]  And you're right, it is theater.
[01:19:56.392 --> 01:20:04.620]  People say, why do they do a year or 14-month, million-dollar investigation of Amish selling cheese and milk to their neighbors?
[01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:13.148]  Turns out the neighbors have moved in and demand they sell them their milk and cheese that their community's eating, so they could take it across state lines and sell it to make it a federal case.
[01:20:13.148 --> 01:20:17.372]  Then they SWAT team them and get them down on the ground when they're a known non-violent sect for 400 years.
[01:20:18.493 --> 01:20:18.733]  Absolutely.
[01:20:18.733 --> 01:20:21.777]  Increasingly, you know, especially in tax cases, especially in non-financial
[01:20:38.115 --> 01:20:48.504]  I mean, I did a case in Boston a few months ago, and they were completing building the Tea Party Museum right there in sight of the courthouse.
[01:20:48.504 --> 01:20:54.569]  And so we took the government's epithet, its defamatory epithet, and we said, no, we'll accept that.
[01:20:54.569 --> 01:20:55.090]  That's right.
[01:20:55.090 --> 01:21:00.595]  My clients are principal tax protesters, and they're protesting taxation without explanation.
[01:21:01.235 --> 01:21:05.959]  Wrote letters to the IRS, asked for the code section that made them liable, no answers.
[01:21:05.959 --> 01:21:08.181]  And we reached that jury on a pretty good level.
[01:21:08.181 --> 01:21:16.288]  So it is drama, and increasingly these prosecutions are done by misleading the jury about things they don't know about, can't be expected to know.
[01:21:16.288 --> 01:21:19.951]  Misleading the jury about tax law, about how accounting is done.
[01:21:19.951 --> 01:21:24.375]  And in Joe's case, of course, it's just the drumbeat that this guy's dangerous.
[01:21:24.375 --> 01:21:27.718]  If you don't convict this guy, he's going to get to the children.
[01:21:27.918 --> 01:21:33.160]  But if we rediscover 1776, common sense says the government's dangerous!
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:33.940]  Absolutely.
[01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:35.761]  We were very aggressive in Joe's trial.
[01:21:35.761 --> 01:21:39.022]  My co-counsel Jeff Dickstein did an incredible job.
[01:21:39.022 --> 01:21:41.603]  And he put to the jury, which side is the con on?
[01:21:41.603 --> 01:21:42.864]  Which side is the con on?
[01:21:42.864 --> 01:21:44.844]  They charged Joe Bannister with conspiracy.
[01:21:44.844 --> 01:21:45.725]  Conspiracy.
[01:21:45.725 --> 01:21:47.765]  Was that a conspiracy?
[01:21:47.765 --> 01:21:49.526]  And we put it to the jury.
[01:21:49.526 --> 01:21:51.567]  You cannot win these cases by half measures.
[01:21:51.567 --> 01:21:54.288]  You can't go in there with soft themes.
[01:21:54.288 --> 01:21:54.728]  I agree.
[01:21:54.728 --> 01:21:56.529]  People say wake up America being nice.
[01:21:56.529 --> 01:21:56.669]  No.
[01:21:57.850 --> 01:21:59.131]  I never calculated anything.
[01:21:59.131 --> 01:22:01.153]  I'm aggressive like a bull in a china shop.
[01:22:01.153 --> 01:22:03.096]  That's what gets results, the truth.
[01:22:03.096 --> 01:22:03.736]  That's right.
[01:22:03.736 --> 01:22:08.341]  And you have to break through the barriers of people from seeing the truth.
[01:22:08.341 --> 01:22:10.724]  Look at Joe's case again.
[01:22:10.724 --> 01:22:11.885]  Did you go with this angle too?
[01:22:12.366 --> 01:22:17.669]  I mean, because I follow some of the news, but was so busy, you know, was just following the paper and talking to Joe some on the phone.
[01:22:17.669 --> 01:22:19.930]  But I, you know, don't have a little inside stuff.
[01:22:19.930 --> 01:22:22.671]  But I would have made the point he was moving up.
[01:22:22.671 --> 01:22:23.632]  He had a career.
[01:22:23.632 --> 01:22:24.953]  He had everything.
[01:22:24.953 --> 01:22:27.574]  He just did this to warn people of the truth.
[01:22:27.574 --> 01:22:29.095]  Why would he lose everything?
[01:22:29.315 --> 01:22:31.277]  They're the liars!
[01:22:31.277 --> 01:22:36.122]  That is a really interesting point, because the government's playbook in criminal tax is greed.
[01:22:36.122 --> 01:22:41.248]  You know, he chose to play, and then they point to the jury, well, you chose to pay.
[01:22:41.248 --> 01:22:45.152]  They create class, economic envy, and responsibility envy.
[01:22:45.152 --> 01:22:47.014]  They tried to trot that theme out in Joe's case.
[01:22:47.014 --> 01:22:48.255]  Closing argument, especially.
[01:22:48.255 --> 01:22:49.516]  Closing argument!
[01:22:49.516 --> 01:22:50.758]  That you lost everything!
[01:22:51.158 --> 01:22:55.221]  He put everything on the line, and yet the greed was the function, the factor?
[01:22:55.221 --> 01:22:56.062]  It was extraordinary.
[01:22:56.062 --> 01:22:57.243]  It wasn't plausible.
[01:22:57.243 --> 01:22:58.884]  And the jury didn't buy it.
[01:22:58.884 --> 01:23:01.906]  Did you tell the story how he set out to disprove the tax protesters?
[01:23:01.906 --> 01:23:02.827]  Absolutely.
[01:23:02.827 --> 01:23:05.009]  There was tons of great testimony and evidence.
[01:23:05.009 --> 01:23:14.336]  And of course, Joe, being a man of integrity, had former colleagues that were videotaped in a deposition talking about what a great special agent he was.
[01:23:14.336 --> 01:23:16.838]  The integrity, the discipline, the work ethic.
[01:23:17.438 --> 01:23:19.340]  So, it was a tough go for the government.
[01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:21.181]  And that was their evidence, but it blew up in their face.
[01:23:21.181 --> 01:23:21.882]  That's right.
[01:23:21.882 --> 01:23:24.204]  They put the evidence of Joe- I find that more and more.
[01:23:24.204 --> 01:23:38.696]  They'll stand up a huge room of, like, 500 Marines, officers, and say, you will not watch Alex Jones, you will make- give people demerits, and- and write them up, and we'll kick them out if they watch it three times, and then all of them go watch it until- and then- and then tell everybody to watch.
[01:23:38.696 --> 01:23:41.899]  So the whole military's watching, because for ten years they tell them don't watch it.
[01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:47.544]  I mean, the system is so disconnected from reality, they seem to be their own worst enemy.
[01:23:47.544 --> 01:23:48.245]  Have you found that?
[01:23:48.245 --> 01:23:52.349]  They are alienated from where America is really at.
[01:23:52.349 --> 01:23:53.470]  They are disconnected.
[01:23:53.470 --> 01:24:00.838]  They believe their own fantasies and the things they want everybody else to believe, and they just assume people believe that.
[01:24:01.638 --> 01:24:15.324]  But when you've got Joe standing up there with the New York Times investigative reporter and a Pulitzer Prize winner, and he's asking questions and taking notes, and Joe is expressing some views and beliefs that he has, the government thought this was sedition of the first order!
[01:24:15.324 --> 01:24:17.364]  This is subversive!
[01:24:17.364 --> 01:24:23.187]  And the jury looked at him and said, well gosh, he's thoughtful, he's speaking his mind, I mean, that's a crime?
[01:24:23.187 --> 01:24:25.608]  And the government's theory was, in fact, that was a crime.
[01:24:25.608 --> 01:24:28.529]  That was a conspiracy to defraud the United States.
[01:24:28.809 --> 01:24:30.031]  And your motto nails it.
[01:24:30.031 --> 01:24:31.652]  There's a war on for your mind.
[01:24:31.652 --> 01:24:34.516]  There's a war on for the juror's mind.
[01:24:34.516 --> 01:24:44.027]  Because all that propaganda and all that conditioning all throughout their lives, the government just wants that to stick long enough to convict the defendant.
[01:24:44.027 --> 01:24:44.828]  People like you.
[01:24:44.828 --> 01:24:46.930]  But when you have somebody that can communicate your innocence,
[01:24:48.497 --> 01:24:50.119]  It snaps them out of that.
[01:24:50.119 --> 01:24:51.040]  Let me ask you this.
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:25:00.731]  Going through the fire, but also getting to defend people like Joe, because I've noticed you only take cases where it's really clear that the government's totally in the wrong there, and still that's an uphill battle.
[01:25:00.731 --> 01:25:07.718]  How good does it feel to actually find a niche in this increasingly corrupt world where you do get to do good work?
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:14.443]  Well, I tell people all the time, I am an extraordinary lucky individual.
[01:25:14.443 --> 01:25:18.566]  Because we actually make a difference once in a while.
[01:25:18.566 --> 01:25:26.351]  And even moving more transcendently from helping Joe out and his family and avoiding 15, 16 years in federal prison, that would be gratifying.
[01:25:26.351 --> 01:25:28.833]  But we do get to make a difference on a larger scale.
[01:25:28.833 --> 01:25:31.915]  That's a blessing in today's world.
[01:25:31.915 --> 01:25:33.296]  You don't get to do that very often.
[01:25:33.576 --> 01:25:35.017]  We take it very seriously at Assembling.
[01:25:35.017 --> 01:25:43.440]  I'll tell you one thing, before the jury came back with the verdict in Joe's case, and I kind of leaned over to him and I said, look, you know, I don't know where this is going.
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:50.463]  We've got a pretty good feeling, but win, lose, or draw, when that jury verdict comes in, you know, we're going to be even keel.
[01:25:50.463 --> 01:25:51.584]  Don't let them do it to it.
[01:25:51.584 --> 01:25:55.586]  We're going to walk out of this courtroom one way or the other with your head held up high.
[01:25:55.586 --> 01:25:56.686]  You're entitled to that.
[01:25:56.686 --> 01:25:58.767]  They can't take that away from you.
[01:25:58.767 --> 01:26:01.188]  If it's a victory, we'll celebrate outside.
[01:26:01.488 --> 01:26:07.070]  You know, and that was one of the most emotional moments of my life when that jury verdict was returned.
[01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:10.052]  The special agent that investigated me?
[01:26:10.052 --> 01:26:13.373]  I want Bob to tell you what he said to Bob upon my acquittal.
[01:26:13.373 --> 01:26:16.054]  Yeah, I came over to, I think it was Special Agent Breslin.
[01:26:16.054 --> 01:26:17.195]  It was Howard and Breslin.
[01:26:17.195 --> 01:26:22.177]  I went over to Special Agent Breslin and, I mean, he had tears running down his face.
[01:26:22.177 --> 01:26:27.939]  And he looked at me and he said, thank you, Counselor, for taking care of our boy Joe.
[01:26:27.939 --> 01:26:28.680]  And I was just...
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.821]  Because there they are, pretty much even having to testify against him.
[01:26:31.821 --> 01:26:33.642]  Imagine the guilt they were going through.
[01:26:33.642 --> 01:26:34.322]  Yeah.
[01:26:34.322 --> 01:26:36.403]  Because when you do evil things, it comes back on you.
[01:26:36.403 --> 01:26:36.784]  That's right.
[01:26:36.784 --> 01:26:39.345]  It was a political prosecution, political persecution.
[01:26:39.345 --> 01:26:40.605]  Everybody knew that.
[01:26:40.605 --> 01:26:45.428]  And those special agents that used to work with Joe, they knew he was a man of integrity.
[01:26:45.428 --> 01:26:48.929]  They knew he didn't have any intent to commit any crime.
[01:26:48.929 --> 01:26:51.971]  He didn't want to commit a crime carrying out the IRS stuff.
[01:26:51.971 --> 01:26:52.471]  That's right.
[01:26:52.471 --> 01:26:54.552]  So he has a crisis of conscience.
[01:26:54.552 --> 01:26:57.333]  But knowing who Joe was, that was unexpected.
[01:26:57.333 --> 01:26:58.354]  I did not expect that.
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:06.541]  Very exciting story.
[01:27:06.541 --> 01:27:07.762]  What about Wesley Snipes?
[01:27:07.762 --> 01:27:13.347]  We've had so many famous trials and you got him to not go to prison for all the fake stuff.
[01:27:13.347 --> 01:27:17.271]  Yeah, that was a really tough case because we were in Ocala, Florida
[01:27:18.312 --> 01:27:24.340]  Everybody thought that he couldn't get a fair trial down there, it was going to be an all-white jury, and it was an all-white jury.
[01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:26.343]  But I picked that jury, and I like that jury.
[01:27:26.343 --> 01:27:30.969]  I thought I picked some really thoughtful people down there.
[01:27:30.969 --> 01:27:35.075]  You know, the problem with representing a high-profile celebrity is the fact that they're high-profile.
[01:27:35.675 --> 01:27:36.896]  Uh, everything changes.
[01:27:36.896 --> 01:27:37.857]  It becomes surreal.
[01:27:37.857 --> 01:27:42.141]  There's an entourage, there was massive media down there, and everything gets distorted.
[01:27:42.141 --> 01:27:45.845]  So we actually had to try that case outside the courtroom as well as inside.
[01:27:45.845 --> 01:27:48.567]  That's the big difference between a non-celebrity.
[01:27:48.567 --> 01:27:54.873]  So many small-time lawyers who aren't, you know, super professional like yourself, they don't get, they always don't talk to the media.
[01:27:54.873 --> 01:27:57.455]  And I'm like, no, it's a media war.
[01:27:57.455 --> 01:27:59.337]  I mean, the prosecutors, they know that.
[01:27:59.517 --> 01:28:01.499]  They're out there giving their press releases.
[01:28:01.499 --> 01:28:09.727]  Prosecution issued a press release that Wesley Snipes was a fugitive and he was in Namibia shooting Gallowalker if I'm not mistaken.
[01:28:09.727 --> 01:28:12.790]  They don't have an extradition treaty at all with the United States.
[01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:18.395]  Wesley could have stayed in Namibia for a good long time, but his attorneys were negotiating with the government his surrender.
[01:28:19.156 --> 01:28:22.179]  Out there in the media, and the jurors hear this, potential jurors hear this.
[01:28:22.179 --> 01:28:23.180]  Oh, he fled.
[01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:23.920]  He's a fugitive.
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:25.262]  He won't come back.
[01:28:25.262 --> 01:28:26.123]  That's evidence of guilt.
[01:28:26.123 --> 01:28:27.324]  That shows that fraud.
[01:28:27.324 --> 01:28:28.405]  I mean, they're saying he's a criminal.
[01:28:28.405 --> 01:28:29.305]  He's run when he hadn't.
[01:28:29.305 --> 01:28:30.146]  We had to fight that.
[01:28:30.146 --> 01:28:36.512]  You have to go out to the media and dispel the misinformation and propaganda to get yourself back to a level playing field.
[01:28:36.512 --> 01:28:37.973]  And if you don't do that, you lose.
[01:28:37.973 --> 01:28:38.694]  And you lose bad.
[01:28:38.694 --> 01:28:40.195]  And Wesley goes to prison for 16 years.
[01:28:40.195 --> 01:28:42.678]  Well, I have a view of the law, not that I'm a lawyer, but I've studied it a bit.
[01:28:43.038 --> 01:28:51.404]  That even if somebody's guilty, if the system cheats, the danger of the system cheating is more dangerous than a guilty person not going to jail.
[01:28:51.404 --> 01:28:52.785]  Well, there's no question about that.
[01:28:52.785 --> 01:29:00.570]  And that's why the discovery violations and the cascading misconduct into federal courts particularly is crucially important to stop and remedy.
[01:29:00.570 --> 01:29:02.131]  An exceptional event occurred.
[01:29:02.131 --> 01:29:08.576]  Judge Richard Tolman, a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals judge after the Stevens case, issued an open letter to Attorney General Holder.
[01:29:09.216 --> 01:29:13.902]  Really an unprecedented event when a judge speaks to the executive branch at such a high level and it's a public letter.
[01:29:13.902 --> 01:29:16.685]  And he says, look at the paraphrasing, look Mr. Holder.
[01:29:47.458 --> 01:29:51.390]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:54.059]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.129 --> 01:30:08.254]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[01:30:08.254 --> 01:30:12.316]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[01:30:12.316 --> 01:30:19.620]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils that are earth-friendly and safe.
[01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:22.442]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com.

[01:30:33.431 --> 01:30:38.835]  Or save big with a 1 to 2 year supply of soaps for all your cleaning needs.
[01:30:38.835 --> 01:30:40.816]  This is an amazing deal.
[01:30:40.816 --> 01:30:46.060]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.

[01:30:57.711 --> 01:31:04.236]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[01:31:04.236 --> 01:31:06.838]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[01:31:06.838 --> 01:31:12.222]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[01:31:12.222 --> 01:31:17.186]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[01:31:17.186 --> 01:31:24.491]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods or meat foods direct now.
[01:31:24.811 --> 01:31:28.695]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[01:31:28.695 --> 01:31:30.476]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[01:31:30.476 --> 01:31:34.499]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we have all known this was coming.
[01:31:34.499 --> 01:31:37.422]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[01:31:37.422 --> 01:31:40.184]  The fact is, you can eat at any time to save money today.
[01:31:40.184 --> 01:31:44.768]  And because it stores for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[01:31:44.768 --> 01:31:45.409]  Don't wait!
[01:31:45.409 --> 01:31:46.890]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:31:46.890 --> 01:31:47.230]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:31:52.895 --> 01:31:55.157]  Or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:31:55.157 --> 01:31:57.539]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[01:31:57.539 --> 01:32:03.043]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[01:32:03.043 --> 01:32:05.445]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:32:05.445 --> 01:32:11.170]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there, bar none, is ProPure.
[01:32:11.170 --> 01:32:14.553]  And it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[01:32:14.553 --> 01:32:18.016]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[01:32:18.016 --> 01:32:19.417]  There's no priming required.
[01:32:19.657 --> 01:32:21.939]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[01:32:21.939 --> 01:32:25.241]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[01:32:25.241 --> 01:32:27.043]  Easy to set up and use.
[01:32:27.043 --> 01:32:28.464]  Doesn't require electricity.
[01:32:28.464 --> 01:32:31.626]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:32:31.626 --> 01:32:35.009]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:32:35.009 --> 01:32:39.152]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:32:39.152 --> 01:32:41.894]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:32:41.894 --> 01:32:43.475]  It's what my family uses.
[01:32:43.475 --> 01:32:44.196]  Infowars.com
[01:32:44.776 --> 01:32:45.437]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:32:45.437 --> 01:32:47.058]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:29.082 --> 01:33:34.605]  We've got a lot of stuff to talk about.
[01:33:34.605 --> 01:33:44.589]  The websites to check out are AgentForTruth.com, that's Joe Bannister's, and there's Robert, or Bob G. Bernhoff's website, BernhoffLaw.com.
[01:33:44.589 --> 01:33:51.773]  And I can tell you, if I ever have the Collection Agency for the Private Fellow Reserve come after me, I know who I'm going to get right over here.
[01:33:51.773 --> 01:33:52.773]  I hope I can get him.
[01:33:52.773 --> 01:33:53.554]  You were telling me that
[01:33:54.474 --> 01:33:58.081]  I was saying, boy, I bet killing is their business and business is good for them.
[01:33:58.081 --> 01:34:01.948]  I bet you trying to save people, I bet your business is just booming.
[01:34:01.948 --> 01:34:06.516]  You know, it is, and it's a bit of a mental torture because
[01:34:08.206 --> 01:34:12.069]  Business is business, and in making a living, there's nothing to apologize for making a living.
[01:34:12.069 --> 01:34:13.590]  But it's grueling, too!
[01:34:13.590 --> 01:34:13.950]  It is.
[01:34:13.950 --> 01:34:16.932]  It takes its toll, and you deal with a lot of human road meat.
[01:34:16.932 --> 01:34:18.173]  The gristmill of the government.
[01:34:18.173 --> 01:34:21.715]  They grind people up, spit them out, don't look back.
[01:34:21.715 --> 01:34:26.838]  And particularly in trials where you have convictions, those are extraordinarily difficult.
[01:34:26.838 --> 01:34:29.620]  You get to know people very well over a 2-3 year period.
[01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:35.044]  If there's not a good outcome at trial, you don't sleep very well for a very, very long time.
[01:34:35.044 --> 01:34:37.966]  I remember the good ones, and there have been plenty of those.
[01:34:38.166 --> 01:34:41.109]  Because it's like a fight, isn't it?
[01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:44.253]  And if you lose, as a man, you really feel like you lost.
[01:34:44.253 --> 01:34:47.516]  Oh yeah, I disappear for several weeks after any trial, win, lose, or draw.
[01:34:47.516 --> 01:34:50.539]  I just kind of disappear for a while and get my head together.
[01:34:50.539 --> 01:34:54.063]  You know, we use a sort of symbolism of combat, and it is.
[01:34:54.063 --> 01:34:58.889]  I called up the government in Casey the other day, I said, boys, are you all ready to sheathe your swords and stop the bloodletting?
[01:34:59.409 --> 01:35:02.851]  They're kind of shocked by that, and they kind of pause for 10 or 15 minutes.
[01:35:02.851 --> 01:35:04.012]  I mean, but that's what it is.
[01:35:04.012 --> 01:35:05.393]  Trials are combat.
[01:35:05.393 --> 01:35:11.177]  And I tell my clients, some of them really want to charge forward to trial, and there's too much machismo going on.
[01:35:11.177 --> 01:35:14.038]  And I say, look, a couple of things I want to mention.
[01:35:14.038 --> 01:35:18.841]  Number one, there's going to be blood everywhere, and we're going to measure the victors by the buckets of blood.
[01:35:18.841 --> 01:35:20.683]  That's reality at trials.
[01:35:21.443 --> 01:35:24.685]  And secondly, I always get to go home after the trials.
[01:35:24.685 --> 01:35:26.906]  So you have to have a sense of humility.
[01:35:26.906 --> 01:35:30.227]  It's better to win the war strategically by never getting to the battlefield.
[01:35:30.227 --> 01:35:31.348]  Oh, no question.
[01:35:31.348 --> 01:35:38.831]  And of course, we do a lot of representation that nobody sees, doesn't make the news, where we're helping people out of audits, collection, criminal investigations.
[01:35:38.831 --> 01:35:41.653]  Just letting the IRS know, hey, go pick on somebody else.
[01:35:42.193 --> 01:35:52.704]  Well, I think there is an element to that because, you know, we practice aggressively but collegially and professionally and I think my counterparts in the government that are opposite me respect that.
[01:35:52.704 --> 01:35:57.929]  So yeah, I think we do help our clients just by entering the fray and solving problems rather than just trial work.
[01:35:57.929 --> 01:35:59.811]  We do a ton of other stuff that nobody sees.
[01:36:00.776 --> 01:36:07.560]  Yeah, I've noticed that because I've got a really good lawyer here in town, and it just immediately gets people's attention.
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:11.442]  A lot of times, pretty big operation stuff comes up from time to time.
[01:36:11.442 --> 01:36:17.946]  Immediately, if you have a small lawyer, I mean, you know that, but for the audience, I'm just telling them that it really does matter.
[01:36:17.946 --> 01:36:26.531]  Well, it does matter, and the other thing is that we're not, you know, increasingly, a huge percentage of federal criminal indictments are resolved by plea agreement.
[01:36:27.031 --> 01:36:30.733]  And there's a very, there's a huge coercion from the sentencing guidelines.
[01:36:30.733 --> 01:36:33.594]  I mean, you've got a businessman, he's indicted for tax.
[01:36:33.594 --> 01:36:39.817]  If he gets dinged with a felony count at trial, he does seven to eight years, maybe the plea's 18 months, 24 months.
[01:36:39.817 --> 01:36:43.899]  So this has a hugely coercive effect to get pleas.
[01:36:43.899 --> 01:36:49.042]  Now when we come to a case, we do trials, we're not afraid of trials, and we win a lot of our trials.
[01:36:49.582 --> 01:36:54.806]  So immediately, our government counterparts understand, okay, this isn't going to be a bagman plea case.
[01:36:54.806 --> 01:36:56.047]  This case could go to trial.
[01:36:56.047 --> 01:36:58.910]  And they start counting their cost and their risk.
[01:36:58.910 --> 01:36:59.790]  You know, what's the problem?
[01:36:59.790 --> 01:37:06.676]  Yeah, they'd rather feed on a bunch of innocent old ladies, ruin their lives, grab wedding rings off their fingers, you know, just let them commit suicide.
[01:37:07.136 --> 01:37:07.817]  I don't think so.
[01:37:22.489 --> 01:37:30.292]  Well, you know what you're talking about, because I've just experienced this 17 years on air and getting out there and doing stuff, you know, up against these crooks, and that's how I see it.
[01:37:30.292 --> 01:37:35.954]  Some of them are Dudley Do-rights, from my experience, who are stupid and are made fun of by the higher-ups.
[01:37:35.954 --> 01:37:37.034]  That's really how this works.
[01:37:37.034 --> 01:37:45.437]  But these are just criminals on the top that know exactly what they're doing, and I don't know how they sleep at night wrecking the families, doing the things they've done to people.
[01:37:45.737 --> 01:37:50.880]  Yeah, you know, the rationalization justification for putting people in prison for double digits over tax.
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:57.284]  By the way, we're the only country of these so-called civilized industrial nations that has criminal tax at all.
[01:37:57.284 --> 01:37:58.524]  Criminal tax is the exception.
[01:37:58.524 --> 01:38:06.009]  Now, Russia, former Soviet Union, Russia, North Korea, China, there's a wonderful series of countries that have a criminal tax regime.
[01:38:06.009 --> 01:38:07.350]  That's not good company.
[01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:09.871]  We should not have criminal tax in the United States.
[01:38:09.871 --> 01:38:12.452]  Oh, that's my next question for you, and Joe, pop in any time.
[01:38:14.312 --> 01:38:18.613]  You know, they grab the kids in Russia, the orphans, train them to be tax enforcers, and they beat you up as well.
[01:38:18.613 --> 01:38:20.233]  So I guess it's the only country worse than us.
[01:38:20.233 --> 01:38:21.754]  Well, I mean, you're the expert.
[01:38:21.754 --> 01:38:23.234]  Is Russia worse than the U.S.?
[01:38:23.234 --> 01:38:26.595]  Yeah, well, the Russian tax police, that's a whole different world.
[01:38:26.595 --> 01:38:28.195]  Really a mafia, I mean.
[01:38:28.195 --> 01:38:28.616]  It is.
[01:38:28.616 --> 01:38:33.937]  But the fact is, is that civilized nations, truly civilized nations, do not criminalize something like tax.
[01:38:33.937 --> 01:38:38.198]  If you owe the government money, the government has plenty of mechanisms to get that money from you.
[01:38:38.838 --> 01:38:43.720]  But to put people in prison for owing tax liability or not filing the proper form.
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:46.540]  North Korea, China, Russia, Nazi Germany, not a good company.
[01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:49.201]  Well, you know, that's the company we're in.
[01:38:49.201 --> 01:38:51.862]  And I argued with David K. Johnson from the New York Times about that.
[01:38:51.862 --> 01:38:56.864]  He was appalled by my idea that criminal tax demonstrated we were uncivilized.
[01:38:56.864 --> 01:38:58.164]  Well, it does.
[01:38:58.164 --> 01:39:00.745]  And I've argued with Nathan Hulkman, former Assistant U.S.
[01:39:00.745 --> 01:39:02.766]  Attorney General, Tax Division for the United States.
[01:39:02.766 --> 01:39:03.946]  He was appalled by that notion.
[01:39:04.406 --> 01:39:05.247]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:39:05.247 --> 01:39:10.931]  I want to go back to the Wesley Snipes because we got cut off by a break, then we went off in another direction, but finish up on this point.
[01:39:10.931 --> 01:39:31.047]  Is all the criminality and government coming out in triplicate and the fact that the IRS is giving out fake ID numbers and letting people steal and get fake returns, the illegals and all the rest of this, and then even blaming citizens when those get attached to Social Security numbers and using the fraud the IRS engaged in as a way to go grab citizens' bank accounts and things?
[01:39:31.767 --> 01:39:40.759]  I mean, is it making it easier for you to do your job as people begin to realize also that the ultra-rich basically have exempted themselves as well?
[01:39:40.759 --> 01:39:43.002]  I think there is a general awareness.
[01:39:43.002 --> 01:39:46.607]  You know, and I'm not going to do an explicitly political thing.
[01:39:46.607 --> 01:39:47.308]  I like dissenters.
[01:39:47.828 --> 01:39:49.350]  I want more dissenters in America.
[01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:51.071]  I want more people that are going to rock the boat.
[01:39:51.071 --> 01:39:58.959]  So the Tea Party movement for me was a good thing because it showed that there could be a vibrant, robust political movement that wasn't party-centric.
[01:39:58.959 --> 01:40:02.662]  And it doesn't matter whether I endorse what they believe or not.
[01:40:02.662 --> 01:40:03.823]  I like the Communist Workers.
[01:40:03.823 --> 01:40:05.285]  I like the Socialist Workers Party.
[01:40:05.285 --> 01:40:09.208]  I want people that are going to rock the boat and diselect Democrats and Republicans.
[01:40:09.208 --> 01:40:12.472]  And I think there's a mood in the country of deepening suspicion.
[01:40:13.212 --> 01:40:17.513]  I think Congress's popularity is down around 9%.
[01:40:17.513 --> 01:40:19.073]  It's really low.
[01:40:19.073 --> 01:40:20.874]  These are huge problems.
[01:40:20.874 --> 01:40:30.256]  I mean, once you lose the consent of the governed, you don't have a legitimate... You either go back to freedom or you go to North Korea.
[01:40:30.256 --> 01:40:31.196]  Absolutely.
[01:40:31.196 --> 01:40:32.296]  And that's where we're treading.
[01:40:32.296 --> 01:40:35.657]  But I believe that there's an increasing awakening in Americans.
[01:40:37.657 --> 01:40:42.320]  Regarding suspicion of the system, suspicion of statements by government.
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:43.521]  And I think that's positive.
[01:40:43.521 --> 01:40:48.785]  I have hope, you know, I have hope that more Americans will recognize that these are political problems.
[01:40:48.785 --> 01:40:50.506]  They're not necessarily legal ones.
[01:40:50.506 --> 01:40:51.727]  We don't need more legislation.
[01:40:51.727 --> 01:40:53.348]  We need less.
[01:40:53.348 --> 01:40:56.390]  And they need to get out there and start voting for people who are going to be truly independent.
[01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:57.051]  Well, I agree.
[01:40:57.051 --> 01:41:01.454]  Anybody that isn't in the cookie cutter mold is the way to go, just because it shakes up the system.
[01:41:01.454 --> 01:41:05.037]  This type of tyranny depends on a very smooth road to get away.
[01:41:05.717 --> 01:41:06.618]  You know, with the crimes.
[01:41:06.618 --> 01:41:07.378]  Let me bring this up.
[01:41:07.378 --> 01:41:11.642]  I also see this endless demonization of defense attorneys by media, by culture.
[01:41:11.642 --> 01:41:13.283]  Oh, they're the scum, they're the trash.
[01:41:13.283 --> 01:41:18.547]  From my experience, everybody deserves a good defense because government is the big danger.
[01:41:18.547 --> 01:41:21.470]  It's what killed more people in history than anything else.
[01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:23.532]  262 million in the last century.
[01:41:23.532 --> 01:41:26.334]  University of Hawaii did a study on democide.
[01:41:26.334 --> 01:41:27.775]  It's the big danger.
[01:41:27.775 --> 01:41:28.556]  And I have found
[01:41:29.096 --> 01:41:35.179]  That it's the political prosecutors, because there's good prosecutors too that will go to the wall to really get bad guys.
[01:41:35.179 --> 01:41:37.480]  But more and more, they just make deals and let them out.
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:43.742]  They want, I notice, these prosecutors to hammer down good people that are just trying to live their lives.
[01:41:43.742 --> 01:41:47.024]  And for me, that's why I thank God for the defense attorneys.
[01:41:47.024 --> 01:41:51.886]  And I see this move to try to demonize defense attorneys, quote, getting bad guys off.
[01:41:52.626 --> 01:41:53.968]  And letting it go to courts.
[01:41:53.968 --> 01:41:57.951]  Boy, if they do that, they've already neutered the grand jury.
[01:41:57.951 --> 01:42:00.254]  All we're left with is the cartridge box.
[01:42:00.254 --> 01:42:08.122]  Yeah, there's a lot of pandering going on from mainstream media about defense attorneys and evil defense attorneys.
[01:42:08.122 --> 01:42:10.904]  Seems to be a general program of defamation.
[01:42:11.685 --> 01:42:19.833]  Um, the fact is, is that in the criminal defense realm, we're accountable in open court on the record more so than any of the civil attorneys are.
[01:42:19.833 --> 01:42:29.462]  They can play games with discovery and engage in litigation thuggery, while we're always accountable on the record every 30 to 60 days for what we're doing and how we're doing it.
[01:42:30.563 --> 01:42:34.284]  My experience with the Federal Criminal Defense Bar is generally very positive.
[01:42:34.284 --> 01:42:35.844]  There's exceptions to that.
[01:42:35.844 --> 01:42:39.705]  And I noticed you mentioned something, Alex, and I want to make a point about this.
[01:42:39.705 --> 01:42:42.686]  I know some really fine lawyers and fine men at U.S.
[01:42:42.686 --> 01:42:56.690]  Department of Justice Tax Division that I've been opposite in cases and local prosecutors who believe in what they're doing, who follow the rules, who don't violate the Constitution and laws of the United States respecting discovery to the defense,
[01:42:57.350 --> 01:43:07.336]  And really, one of the things that really bothers me is all of those good men and women that are actually inside the system and are behaving with integrity, they get stroked with all of this massive misconduct.
[01:43:07.336 --> 01:43:08.176]  Well, that's the problem.
[01:43:08.176 --> 01:43:15.540]  The good people get out, historically, and then the criminals create little armies that then expand and then take over.
[01:43:15.540 --> 01:43:17.802]  Yes, when bad conduct is incentived.
[01:43:18.464 --> 01:43:24.426]  Rather than disincentive, it does drive out the ethical and the good and the men and women that want to do a public service.
[01:43:24.426 --> 01:43:25.826]  Because there's bad guys out there.
[01:43:25.826 --> 01:43:27.486]  We live in a dangerous world.
[01:43:27.486 --> 01:43:31.147]  And I believe in law and order, even though I'm a Libertarian, but I believe in law and order.
[01:43:31.147 --> 01:43:32.608]  And I'm an objective moralist.
[01:43:32.608 --> 01:43:35.289]  And that means law and order and the government first.
[01:43:35.289 --> 01:43:36.049]  Absolutely.
[01:43:36.049 --> 01:43:37.409]  The government is the great teacher.
[01:43:37.409 --> 01:43:38.349]  We learn by them.
[01:43:38.349 --> 01:43:42.771]  If the government breaks the rules and gets away with impunity, what does that teach the citizens?
[01:43:42.771 --> 01:43:43.731]  Fish rots from the head.
[01:43:43.951 --> 01:43:44.751]  Absolutely.
[01:43:44.751 --> 01:43:46.532]  Some things roll downhill.
[01:43:46.532 --> 01:43:47.433]  Joe, you've been sitting here.
[01:43:47.433 --> 01:43:48.894]  This guy's amazing.
[01:43:48.894 --> 01:43:50.114]  I've seen him on TV before.
[01:43:50.114 --> 01:43:52.435]  I was sitting here looking, I see this guy on television.
[01:43:52.435 --> 01:43:53.156]  He's impressive.
[01:43:53.156 --> 01:43:57.118]  I mean, we know why he's one of the best lawyers out there, I guess.
[01:43:57.118 --> 01:43:58.299]  How did you snag this guy?
[01:43:58.299 --> 01:44:00.039]  I guess because you're a good guy, too.
[01:44:00.039 --> 01:44:08.464]  Well, a month or two after I resigned from the IRS in 99, really right around the same time that you first interviewed me, I get a call from this Bob Bernhoff from Milwaukee.
[01:44:08.464 --> 01:44:11.145]  And you know, I was like a deer caught in the headlights.
[01:44:11.145 --> 01:44:11.766]  I just wanted to
[01:44:12.506 --> 01:44:18.673]  Make a living to support my family and leave the IRS behind, but people were calling me and wanting to get in contact with me.
[01:44:18.673 --> 01:44:28.883]  So that's when I first met Bob and had no idea the extent of the monster that was out there eating people up.
[01:44:31.125 --> 01:44:43.432]  It helped me to understand that, and then I became involved in it, and of course that's what led to the IRS, you know, really taking a disliking to me after I left, because I was trying to get into that apparatus.
[01:44:43.432 --> 01:44:48.275]  Actually, I was not trying to get into the apparatus, people wanted me to come in and help the effort.
[01:44:48.275 --> 01:44:49.395]  No, I know you were drug into it.
[01:44:49.395 --> 01:44:58.821]  I didn't want... I had enough of the IRS, frankly, but... I remember at first I was trying to get you back on the radio and stuff, you're like, I don't know right now, I'm just... I might just be a CPA, I might blah blah blah, but...
[01:44:59.341 --> 01:45:02.784]  Well, you've been with me since the beginning, Alex.
[01:45:02.784 --> 01:45:08.489]  I mean, I was just... It was like March or... Was it Media Bypass you were first in?
[01:45:08.489 --> 01:45:08.910]  Yeah.
[01:45:08.910 --> 01:45:10.331]  Pat Shannon called me.
[01:45:10.331 --> 01:45:10.932]  That's right.
[01:45:10.932 --> 01:45:12.693]  We need to get Pat Shannon back on.
[01:45:12.693 --> 01:45:16.256]  He was on my radio show talking about Oklahoma City being a staged event.
[01:45:17.097 --> 01:45:25.646]  And he said, hey, I'm doing a story on this, you know, Treasury agent who investigated things and woke things up.
[01:45:25.646 --> 01:45:26.507]  You ought to talk to him.
[01:45:26.507 --> 01:45:27.948]  And I said, OK, well, what's his number?
[01:45:27.948 --> 01:45:33.174]  And so I had gone out and interviewed you by the time his newspaper article or magazine article came out.
[01:45:33.174 --> 01:45:35.216]  Now that my memory gets refreshed, very exciting.
[01:45:35.216 --> 01:45:37.598]  Yeah, that was the tax issue for 1999.
[01:45:37.598 --> 01:45:39.220]  But you've now been through the fire, my friend.
[01:45:40.701 --> 01:45:44.205]  Well thanks to, unfortunately you don't, you're not innocent until proven guilty.
[01:45:44.205 --> 01:45:47.828]  You need to find someone who can communicate your innocence.
[01:45:47.828 --> 01:45:54.935]  And I've just been blessed to have Mr. Bernhoft, Mr. Dickstein, people that could communicate to the jury.
[01:45:56.050 --> 01:46:02.576]  No, the government really doesn't deserve that reputation for honesty and integrity that you think they have.
[01:46:02.576 --> 01:46:05.938]  Open up your mind and look at the evidence.
[01:46:05.938 --> 01:46:07.400]  And that's what it took.
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:08.881]  And they acquitted me.
[01:46:08.881 --> 01:46:12.364]  Mr. Bernhoff, let me ask you a question on this front.
[01:46:12.364 --> 01:46:18.909]  Can you bring in, let's say you were doing a trial right now of another agent, a whistleblower, somebody like
[01:46:20.748 --> 01:46:32.080]  Our guest here today, what, could you bring in the fact that John Corzine was allowed to take billions of dollars and say he doesn't know where it went, and then now they admit he really did give it to another bank?
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:37.727]  I mean, could you bring up, hey, the big bankers, they get to keep billions, but he hasn't done anything and he's in trouble.
[01:46:37.727 --> 01:46:38.828]  Or is that not admissible?
[01:46:39.048 --> 01:46:39.729]  No, it's not.
[01:46:39.729 --> 01:46:41.850]  You know, that stuff doesn't come in now.
[01:46:41.850 --> 01:46:47.994]  There's an old Supreme Court case that says that in closing argument, defense attorneys have to be given wings to soar.
[01:46:47.994 --> 01:46:55.519]  That's a great quote and it's true, but you can only bring in testimony and evidence that's going to be relevant to the charges that tend to disprove them.
[01:46:55.519 --> 01:46:59.802]  We can bring in impeachment evidence against government witnesses and we can certainly do that.
[01:46:59.802 --> 01:47:06.427]  Could you say this same government lets John Corzine take billions that disappear, but then they want to send him to jail but he hasn't taken a single cent?
[01:47:06.827 --> 01:47:07.668]  Uh, that can be done.
[01:47:07.668 --> 01:47:09.671]  Uh, and that can be done in closing argument.
[01:47:09.671 --> 01:47:12.874]  Closing argument in Joe's case was very, very aggressive.
[01:47:12.874 --> 01:47:17.260]  Uh, and, uh, I mean, there were, there was talk of jackbooted thugs and all sorts of interesting things.
[01:47:17.694 --> 01:47:18.975]  But no, you can do that.
[01:47:18.975 --> 01:47:35.806]  Testimony and evidence is one thing, but closing argument, you can draw parallels, you can put it to the jury that they've got a decision to make, that there's a double standard operating here, and that the government is not behaving correctly towards your client, the defendant who's in the block and stands to go to prison for 15, 16 years.
[01:47:35.806 --> 01:47:37.988]  Finishing up with Wesley Snipes, we've got a final segment.
[01:47:37.988 --> 01:47:39.288]  You guys can talk about whatever you'd like.
[01:47:39.288 --> 01:47:41.870]  I'm just in awe here, hearing all of this.
[01:47:43.391 --> 01:47:48.294]  You had gotten to the point of how they were trying to try the case in the media and claiming he'd run from justice.
[01:47:48.294 --> 01:47:51.636]  And I remember right away in the news, you guys went, this is propaganda.
[01:47:51.636 --> 01:47:53.338]  He was always intending to be here.
[01:47:53.338 --> 01:47:54.138]  Here he is.
[01:47:54.138 --> 01:47:54.558]  Right.
[01:47:54.558 --> 01:48:01.223]  We had to, whatever jury was finally in that box in the courtroom, and I'll tell you something, Judge William Terrell Hodges was an excellent judge.
[01:48:01.983 --> 01:48:02.283]  I don't know.
[01:48:23.096 --> 01:48:29.142]  But nobody gets any respect in the federal criminal process by not being aggressive and advocating zealously for your client.
[01:48:29.142 --> 01:48:34.647]  But in the Snipes case, you've got to get people to reject that propaganda, that misinformation.
[01:48:34.647 --> 01:48:38.750]  And we consistently said, look, 12 people are going to be in that jury box.
[01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:45.256]  And they're the ones who are going to hear actual testimony and evidence, not rumor, not innuendo, not propaganda.
[01:48:45.256 --> 01:48:46.878]  And those are the themes that we beat.
[01:48:46.878 --> 01:48:47.919]  We drilled those themes.
[01:48:48.419 --> 01:48:49.019]  And we had to.
[01:48:49.019 --> 01:48:56.883]  I did a walk and talk with Steve Barrett, great reporter from Orlando, a TV station down there, and we pummeled back against this propaganda.
[01:48:56.883 --> 01:49:06.827]  If you don't do that, those jurors are going to go in there with absolute misinformation in their minds, and they won't pay attention to the actual truth, the actual testimony and evidence, and then you're in trouble.
[01:49:06.827 --> 01:49:08.548]  And that's when you lose, and that's when you get convicted.
[01:49:09.068 --> 01:49:12.650]  And that's what would have happened down there, no question about it.
[01:49:12.650 --> 01:49:16.051]  The other thing is, you know, there were some discovery violations in the Snipes case.
[01:49:16.051 --> 01:49:18.332]  Those never became really public.
[01:49:18.332 --> 01:49:21.013]  We were really put to it by the prosecution team.
[01:49:21.013 --> 01:49:28.156]  They were revealing sometimes hundreds of pages of crucial documents the day after a particular trial day at 5-5-30.
[01:49:28.156 --> 01:49:32.238]  And we had to spend all night mastering that material so we could step up the next morning.
[01:49:32.238 --> 01:49:38.401]  It was a very, very difficult... They were hoping you'd be lazy and go back to the hotel and get a scotch, but you'd have to stay up all night.
[01:49:38.601 --> 01:49:40.982]  I'll tell you something, people have a misapprehension of how trials work.
[01:49:40.982 --> 01:49:42.802]  Once you go, we call it going into the trial hole.
[01:49:42.802 --> 01:49:47.443]  You go into the trial hole, you are off the grid, nobody, you don't even know- If you're a winner.
[01:49:47.443 --> 01:49:48.204]  Absolutely.
[01:49:48.204 --> 01:49:53.345]  You've got to be prepared to get a couple of hours of sleep a night, take it seriously, and the work is extraordinary.
[01:49:53.345 --> 01:49:54.445]  Nobody sees that.
[01:49:54.445 --> 01:49:56.086]  That's all that work that goes behind the scenes.
[01:49:56.086 --> 01:49:57.666]  Joe can testify to that.
[01:49:57.666 --> 01:50:00.687]  How many nights- And the defendant better jump in and pout all night.
[01:50:00.687 --> 01:50:07.309]  That's another thing, people think high-powered lawyers, you know, because the media acts like they just show up in a helicopter and win because they're-
[01:50:07.569 --> 01:50:10.633]  No, it's a bunch of, it's a real work.
[01:50:10.633 --> 01:50:11.934]  And some of it's extremely tedious.
[01:50:11.934 --> 01:50:15.838]  You know, you got a case, the Snipes case said over a million pages of discovery documents.
[01:50:15.838 --> 01:50:18.542]  You don't master those documents, you're going to lose.
[01:50:18.542 --> 01:50:21.745]  And that's the sort of paging through page after page after page.
[01:50:21.745 --> 01:50:23.207]  I mean, that's where the nuggets come from.
[01:50:23.467 --> 01:50:27.468]  Yeah, I think you had, what, 58 boxes of discovery?
[01:50:27.468 --> 01:50:29.108]  A couple hundred thousand pages?
[01:50:29.108 --> 01:50:31.809]  So that's the sort of work that goes on behind the scenes.
[01:50:31.809 --> 01:50:39.030]  Trial success is a function of knowledge, skill, experience, but most importantly, mastery of the facts and the documents.
[01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:46.052]  If you're not willing to get dirty, roll up your sleeves with your team and your client like Joe, who helped us through his discovery, and drill down night after
[01:50:46.152 --> 01:50:47.833]  Well, that sounds like life in general.
[01:50:47.833 --> 01:50:51.216]  I mean, the system counts on us just being lazy, lying the surface.
[01:50:51.216 --> 01:50:52.017]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:52.017 --> 01:50:54.459]  Final, incredible segment with both our guests.
[01:50:54.459 --> 01:50:55.960]  I'm Alex Jones at fullwars.com.
[01:50:59.747 --> 01:51:05.932]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[01:51:05.932 --> 01:51:11.037]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[01:51:11.037 --> 01:51:13.239]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[01:51:13.239 --> 01:51:20.525]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[01:51:21.005 --> 01:51:24.708]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[01:51:24.708 --> 01:51:28.972]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[01:51:28.972 --> 01:51:35.657]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[01:51:35.657 --> 01:51:38.619]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[01:51:38.619 --> 01:51:41.642]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[01:51:41.642 --> 01:51:45.285]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[01:51:45.285 --> 01:51:47.707]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[01:51:48.207 --> 01:51:53.189]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[01:51:53.189 --> 01:51:57.970]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[01:51:57.970 --> 01:52:02.752]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:52:02.752 --> 01:52:05.772]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:52:05.772 --> 01:52:14.095]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:52:14.742 --> 01:52:20.283]  Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:52:20.283 --> 01:52:31.665]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only, without harming a single normal cell.
[01:52:31.665 --> 01:52:38.667]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:52:39.347 --> 01:52:43.629]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[01:52:43.629 --> 01:52:47.231]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[01:52:47.231 --> 01:52:54.495]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[01:52:54.495 --> 01:52:55.775]  Protect your immune system.
[01:52:55.775 --> 01:52:56.816]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:52:57.336 --> 01:53:04.040]  After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've witnessed that a lot of illness can be linked to toxins and deficiencies combined.
[01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:10.543]  Improving your liver function and restoring your cells' ability to detoxify is essential to achieving radiant health.
[01:53:10.543 --> 01:53:14.726]  Listen to the real-world results of Doug and his wife after taking One World Way.
[01:53:14.726 --> 01:53:16.106]  My name is Doug Diderot.
[01:53:16.106 --> 01:53:19.168]  For years, I had an ongoing rash with itching around my eyes.
[01:53:19.168 --> 01:53:22.590]  This was due to metal dust particles landing on my face in the workplace.
[01:53:23.070 --> 01:53:29.757]  After being on One World Way for two weeks, I began to have a severe rash and itching sensation around my eyes.
[01:53:29.757 --> 01:53:33.841]  This rash and itching lasted for five weeks and is now 100% gone.
[01:53:33.841 --> 01:53:42.169]  Additionally, without extra exercise, I've also increased my muscle size and my wife has lost weight and gained a more attractive figure.
[01:53:42.669 --> 01:53:43.150]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:53:43.150 --> 01:53:43.511]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:53:43.511 --> 01:53:43.811]  888-988-3325.
[01:53:43.811 --> 01:53:45.253]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[01:53:45.253 --> 01:53:46.115]  That's OneWorldWhey.com.
[01:54:09.087 --> 01:54:13.868]  There's a man going around taking names.
[01:54:13.868 --> 01:54:15.829]  And he decides who to free.
[01:54:15.829 --> 01:54:20.890]  We're ending this segment, this interview, with a good song.
[01:54:20.890 --> 01:54:24.291]  Johnny Cash, when the man comes around.
[01:54:24.291 --> 01:54:27.651]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down.
[01:54:27.651 --> 01:54:29.892]  When the man comes around.
[01:54:29.892 --> 01:54:33.213]  Robert G. Bernhoft, probably the most
[01:54:34.093 --> 01:54:36.575]  I mean, I can't think of anybody more preeminent than you when it comes to tax stuff.
[01:54:36.575 --> 01:54:37.675]  It's an honor to have you.
[01:54:37.675 --> 01:54:42.098]  And I can't think of somebody more honorable and preeminent when it comes to standing up for what's right.
[01:54:42.098 --> 01:54:44.079]  They ought to make a movie about your life.
[01:54:44.079 --> 01:54:55.185]  Joe Bannister, agentfortruth.com, agentfortruth.com, and again, bernhoftlaw.com, B-E-R-N-H-O-F-T-L-A-W-T-C-O-M.
[01:54:55.185 --> 01:54:58.027]  We'll make sure both these get linked up at infowars.com today.
[01:54:58.527 --> 01:55:08.381]  And if you're a radio listener on XM or on our 100-plus stations, by tomorrow we will have this up on YouTube for everybody, not just people watching at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:55:08.381 --> 01:55:11.785]  And so please get this video and get it out to everybody.
[01:55:11.785 --> 01:55:15.050]  That's a question I have for you, Robert.
[01:55:15.971 --> 01:55:17.672]  When does the man come to town?
[01:55:17.672 --> 01:55:22.115]  Because, you know, earlier you said we're treading water between North Korea and Liberty.
[01:55:22.115 --> 01:55:23.035]  We're going to choose one or the other.
[01:55:23.035 --> 01:55:28.398]  We're going to go back the other direction towards freedom or we're going to go down the black hole.
[01:55:28.398 --> 01:55:30.439]  I mean, is the man going to come around?
[01:55:30.439 --> 01:55:33.661]  People are waking up, but the system is deciding to go with tyranny.
[01:55:33.661 --> 01:55:36.523]  How do you see this with your considerable gravitas?
[01:55:36.523 --> 01:55:37.563]  How do you see this ending?
[01:55:37.563 --> 01:55:38.824]  I mean, what's your gut tell you?
[01:55:41.857 --> 01:55:43.339]  That's a heavy and loaded question.
[01:55:43.339 --> 01:55:45.522]  It's a great one.
[01:55:45.522 --> 01:55:56.136]  In my sphere, putting aside from politics, if we don't stop, if we don't stem this epidemic of investigative and prosecutorial misconduct, we're in deep trouble.
[01:55:56.696 --> 01:56:07.423]  If our federal criminal process continues to be debauched by concealment and deceit, ethics violations, constitutional violations, it's over for the American Republic.
[01:56:07.423 --> 01:56:13.226]  I mean, we used to be sort of like the lighthouse on the hill, the example of great judicial systems.
[01:56:13.226 --> 01:56:19.090]  The whole world looked to the United States for our rules, our evidence, our procedure, our process, our jury trials.
[01:56:19.710 --> 01:56:20.350]  We're losing that.
[01:56:20.350 --> 01:56:22.011]  We're becoming a laughing stock.
[01:56:22.011 --> 01:56:27.914]  Yeah, the great Americans, and look at, they can't even get a fair trial for a former sitting United States Senator.
[01:56:27.914 --> 01:56:32.196]  If we don't stem it, if we don't stem it... Look at how they put that governor in jail in Alabama for no reason.
[01:56:32.196 --> 01:56:32.937]  Yeah.
[01:56:32.937 --> 01:56:34.657]  That was admitted a fraud.
[01:56:34.657 --> 01:56:42.221]  And the amazing thing about the former Senator Steven's prosecution, and there's thousands of these cases, that one gets all the publicity because he was a former U.S.
[01:56:42.221 --> 01:56:43.182]  Senator.
[01:56:43.182 --> 01:56:45.783]  And that shifted the balance of power in the United States Senate.
[01:56:46.243 --> 01:56:54.567]  But when you think about the Stevens case, that was prosecuted by the highest level of Department of Justice in Washington, the Office of Public Integrity, OPR.
[01:56:54.567 --> 01:56:58.990]  They couldn't get that right, and they want to say that lying AUSAs, Assistant U.S.
[01:56:58.990 --> 01:57:02.872]  Attorneys, really understand the discovery rules.
[01:57:02.872 --> 01:57:11.016]  This needs to stop, and responsible prosecutors are for changing the rules and disciplining prosecutors who do not follow the rules.
[01:57:11.576 --> 01:57:13.458]  Federal judges are getting sick and tired of this.
[01:57:13.458 --> 01:57:19.044]  Well, what about when it comes out that we've got to do five minutes overdrive, you can do it just to finish up this little addendum we have.
[01:57:19.044 --> 01:57:22.547]  Kind of like, you know, that little extra reserve tank.
[01:57:22.547 --> 01:57:23.748]  What?
[01:57:23.748 --> 01:57:25.991]  How do they get away with this?
[01:57:25.991 --> 01:57:29.875]  Because more and more it's just coming out that the sky's the limit.
[01:57:29.875 --> 01:57:32.217]  I think they're doing it on purpose, basically.
[01:57:32.217 --> 01:57:34.499]  Well, the incentives are to win at all costs.
[01:57:35.220 --> 01:57:38.923]  And when you have an incentive to do that, people start breaking the rules.
[01:57:38.923 --> 01:57:45.628]  And then they start becoming rewarded for breaking the rules with conviction rates, promotions, and the things that they want.
[01:57:45.628 --> 01:57:48.110]  And then they recognize that they never get caught.
[01:57:48.110 --> 01:57:50.112]  And if they do get caught, they never get punished.
[01:57:50.112 --> 01:57:51.693]  Well, you saw the case in Williamson County.
[01:57:51.693 --> 01:57:57.597]  It's a famous one where they knew the guy really didn't do it, and they suppressed evidence, and they tried to keep the guy in prison.
[01:57:57.597 --> 01:58:01.340]  I mean, how does somebody try to put people who aren't even criminals?
[01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:03.202]  It's bad enough to set up an ex-con.
[01:58:03.782 --> 01:58:06.023]  And send them away, but well, they shouldn't have been out.
[01:58:06.023 --> 01:58:08.303]  But now it's just set up totally innocent people?
[01:58:08.303 --> 01:58:16.446]  Yeah, you look at the prosecutor in the non-rape Duke LaCrosse case, for example, which, of course, no rape occurred, and that was all politics by that prosecutor.
[01:58:16.446 --> 01:58:22.947]  He's the only prosecutor that's been meaningfully disciplined for massive government misconduct in a very, very long time.
[01:58:22.947 --> 01:58:32.690]  So what happens is, even if the judge makes what's called a judicial referral of a prosecutor to the Bar Association, where that prosecutor has his license, the bars don't discipline the prosecutors.
[01:58:32.810 --> 01:58:38.676]  Tell you what, back in one minute of five minute overdrive, I've got to hear more about the lacrosse case.
[01:58:38.676 --> 01:58:40.078]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:51.083 --> 01:58:56.086]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:58:56.086 --> 01:59:03.270]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:59:03.410 --> 01:59:09.035]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:59:09.035 --> 01:59:13.079]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[01:59:43.832 --> 01:59:45.112]  We're getting prepared.

[01:59:53.445 --> 02:00:00.547]  Alex Jones on GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:00.547 --> 02:00:01.868]  Big Brother.
[02:00:01.868 --> 02:00:03.628]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:03.628 --> 02:00:05.389]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:05.389 --> 02:00:06.969]  You want answers?
[02:00:06.969 --> 02:00:08.510]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:08.510 --> 02:00:12.711]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:12.711 --> 02:00:16.773]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:18.899 --> 02:00:19.460]  We're good.
[02:00:36.021 --> 02:00:43.103]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we've got a very special presentation lined up for you in the next 60 minutes.
[02:00:43.103 --> 02:00:49.605]  And I'm presenting this not because I think it, but because I know it, and I've seen the dramatic results.
[02:00:49.605 --> 02:00:53.066]  And this is a major revolution against the globalists.
[02:00:53.066 --> 02:00:54.727]  Getting the fluoride out of the water is?
[02:00:55.862 --> 02:00:57.403]  Well, I'm going to talk more about it later in the hour.
[02:00:57.403 --> 02:01:01.066]  Getting the GMO out of our lives that they're trying to assault us with.
[02:01:01.066 --> 02:01:06.431]  But the trace elements, minerals and vitamins, when you get it all together, it helps battle all the other stuff.
[02:01:06.431 --> 02:01:11.215]  But they want you sick, the medical system, Big Pharma, they don't want you to know.
[02:01:11.215 --> 02:01:14.357]  They know, they knew when the 20 sodium fluoride brain damaged you.
[02:01:14.357 --> 02:01:17.980]  They know MSG is toxic and causes neurological disorders.
[02:01:17.980 --> 02:01:22.464]  And they know that most of these illnesses are mineral and vitamin deficiencies.
[02:01:22.464 --> 02:01:23.184]  Well, joining us
[02:01:24.266 --> 02:01:28.208]  He is a pharmacist, compounding pharmacist for more than 20 years, Ben Fuchs.
[02:01:28.208 --> 02:01:32.350]  He's a syndicated radio host here on the GCN Network, GCNLive.com.
[02:01:32.350 --> 02:01:36.872]  And he joins us, he's part of InfoWarsTeam.com as well, and one of our advisors.
[02:01:36.872 --> 02:01:42.955]  We've got medical doctors, veterinarians, naturopaths, all advising us at InfoWarsTeam.com.
[02:01:42.955 --> 02:01:45.496]  You can see those videos posted there in Aaron's testimonial.
[02:01:45.496 --> 02:01:47.437]  But that's not why this is here today.
[02:01:47.437 --> 02:01:49.157]  That's not why we're covering this.
[02:01:49.157 --> 02:01:52.119]  We are going to engage in the public service.
[02:01:53.292 --> 02:01:56.393]  Of going through everything.
[02:01:56.393 --> 02:02:08.235]  Of going through all the vitamins, all the minerals, and then trace elements, just bam, bam, bam, quickly, and then we can go back through other issues that the system doesn't want you to know.
[02:02:08.235 --> 02:02:14.716]  I had a family member who I noticed was only drinking Coca-Colas about five years ago.
[02:02:14.716 --> 02:02:19.797]  They were old, they were pretty much gonna die, and I just begged him, I said, if you will just start drinking water,
[02:02:21.923 --> 02:02:28.504]  Your body, you're dehydrated because Coca-Cola and things, and iced tea, you name it, is what is it called?
[02:02:28.504 --> 02:02:29.525]  A diuretic.
[02:02:29.525 --> 02:02:31.205]  It makes you urinate.
[02:02:31.205 --> 02:02:34.285]  You drink 20 ounces, you urinate 25 ounces.
[02:02:34.285 --> 02:02:36.946]  I said, you look like beef jerky, you gotta drink water.
[02:02:36.946 --> 02:02:41.247]  And they got mad at me and started drinking water and looked like a new person.
[02:02:41.247 --> 02:02:42.527]  Again, it's like simple.
[02:02:42.527 --> 02:02:46.448]  Your teeth will fall out and old wounds will open up and your hair will fall out if you don't get vitamin C.
[02:02:48.140 --> 02:02:52.742]  We've got these food deserts out there, not just in poor areas, everywhere.
[02:02:52.742 --> 02:02:55.003]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs joins us after this break.
[02:02:55.003 --> 02:02:57.564]  He is waiting in the wings right now.
[02:02:57.564 --> 02:03:00.365]  In fact, Pharmacist Ben, we've got two minutes until we've got a break.
[02:03:00.365 --> 02:03:02.085]  Tell us what's coming up today.
[02:03:02.085 --> 02:03:04.026]  You've lined up an incredible presentation.
[02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:06.501]  Well, I've got lots of stuff to talk about.
[02:03:06.501 --> 02:03:07.642]  Thank you for the intro, Alex.
[02:03:07.642 --> 02:03:08.642]  Thank you for the kind words.
[02:03:08.642 --> 02:03:11.504]  There's a lot of stuff in the news.
[02:03:11.504 --> 02:03:14.586]  I like the Consumer Reports article that came out a couple of weeks ago.
[02:03:14.586 --> 02:03:17.328]  Ten surprising dangers of vitamins and supplements.
[02:03:17.328 --> 02:03:19.269]  I'd love to be able to address that.
[02:03:19.269 --> 02:03:23.031]  There was a study that came out, I think it was last week, in the Journal of Nature Medicine.
[02:03:23.031 --> 02:03:26.033]  Chemotherapy can actually cause cancer.
[02:03:26.033 --> 02:03:28.675]  I thought that was pretty fascinating.
[02:03:28.675 --> 02:03:29.335]  Let's see.
[02:03:29.335 --> 02:03:31.777]  Statin drugs linked with development of cataracts.
[02:03:31.997 --> 02:03:33.699]  What else do you want to talk about here, Alex?
[02:03:33.699 --> 02:03:44.888]  There's the sugary drink ban in New York, and the digital pill they want you to swallow that will give doctors the real-time scoop on what's happening inside your body.
[02:03:44.888 --> 02:03:46.469]  That could be kind of interesting.
[02:03:46.469 --> 02:03:49.392]  How about dentists wanting us to drink more fluoride?
[02:03:49.392 --> 02:03:52.214]  They don't like bottled water because people aren't getting enough fluoride.
[02:03:52.214 --> 02:03:53.715]  We can talk about that, too.
[02:03:53.715 --> 02:03:54.916]  Lots of stuff here we could talk about.
[02:03:54.916 --> 02:03:57.459]  Diabetes drugs raise the risk of bladder cancer.
[02:03:57.459 --> 02:03:59.280]  Statin drugs raise the risk of diabetes.
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:00.401]  There's tons of good stuff, Alex.
[02:04:00.401 --> 02:04:03.422]  I want to go over all those studies, but I heard your show a few days ago.
[02:04:03.422 --> 02:04:16.764]  It was just a couple days ago, and you were going over just this mineral when you have this deficiency does this, this vitamin deficiency does that, this pancreatic problem caused by this, and the system knows that.
[02:04:16.764 --> 02:04:29.366]  So, you know, we talked a few days ago and you sent a whole big rundown of documents and articles and studies, and so I want to go over, just at first, the different vitamins,
[02:04:30.606 --> 02:04:40.570]  And then what those deficiencies do, different minerals, what is needed, what the really cool cofactors are, trace elements, things like that, with pharmacist Ben Fuchs.
[02:04:40.570 --> 02:04:44.752]  And then we'll get into all those news items that you just mentioned straight ahead.
[02:04:44.752 --> 02:04:50.194]  I'm Alex Jones with pharmacist Ben Fuchs, InfoWarsTeam.com's got our latest videos up there right now.

[02:05:55.980 --> 02:05:57.281]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:57.281 --> 02:06:02.865]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:06:02.865 --> 02:06:07.889]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:06:07.889 --> 02:06:08.369]  It's true.
[02:06:08.369 --> 02:06:12.913]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:06:13.453 --> 02:06:18.677]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:06:18.677 --> 02:06:20.978]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.

[02:08:20.573 --> 02:08:23.654]  Well, he's back by popular demand.
[02:08:23.654 --> 02:08:25.054]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:08:25.054 --> 02:08:32.236]  I'm Alex Jones on this Wednesday, 15th day of August 2012 edition.
[02:08:32.236 --> 02:08:36.277]  Compounding pharmacist Ben Fuchs will be with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:08:36.277 --> 02:08:37.458]  Syndicated radio host.
[02:08:38.158 --> 02:08:41.440]  And an advisor to Infowarsteam.com.
[02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:50.183]  And we're going to get later into the fact they want to put statin drugs in the water, they want to put more fluoride in food for kids, even though the government admits it's killing them.
[02:08:50.183 --> 02:08:54.285]  They're saying, don't eat yolk and eggs, it's more dangerous than smoking.
[02:08:54.285 --> 02:08:56.486]  Now they want to tax that.
[02:08:56.486 --> 02:08:58.987]  Just all of this incredible nanny state.
[02:08:58.987 --> 02:09:06.391]  Meanwhile, Big Pharma, Big Medical notes that most illnesses, in their own documents, and we have them right here, we're going to go over them today,
[02:09:07.409 --> 02:09:15.773]  That their own documents show that they know that most diseases are vitamin, mineral, trace element, and cofactor deficiencies.
[02:09:15.773 --> 02:09:17.794]  They know why pancreatic cancer is way up.
[02:09:17.794 --> 02:09:19.775]  They know why type 2 diabetes is way up.
[02:09:19.775 --> 02:09:21.516]  They know why cancer is way up.
[02:09:21.516 --> 02:09:29.360]  They knew that 20 sodium fluoride and other forms of fluoride put in the water causes a 7-fold increase in bone cancer alone and reduced IQ.
[02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:36.524]  Harvard came out last week in a decades-plus long study and said, combining a whole bunch of other studies, and said, yeah, this is happening.
[02:09:36.724 --> 02:09:37.325]  They know!
[02:09:37.325 --> 02:09:38.646]  They know it all!
[02:09:38.646 --> 02:09:39.267]  They know!
[02:09:39.267 --> 02:09:42.291]  The average doctor does it, they just follow what they're told.
[02:09:42.291 --> 02:09:44.834]  But this is a real revolution against tyranny.
[02:09:45.677 --> 02:10:03.607]  Just like the British, and I've told this story many times, 300 plus years ago, their Academy of Sciences, their Royal Academy, discovered whatever was in green vegetables and fruits, vitamin C later discovered, but they knew if you had that, your old wounds didn't open up, you stayed healthy, your teeth didn't fall out with scurvy.
[02:10:03.607 --> 02:10:09.150]  So all the other navies, the French, the Spanish, they made fun of them and called them limeys.
[02:10:10.646 --> 02:10:10.806]  That's
[02:10:27.964 --> 02:10:30.285]  With all these toxic additives.
[02:10:30.285 --> 02:10:32.445]  Hundreds of things you eat at different fast food places.
[02:10:32.445 --> 02:10:37.566]  Hundreds of fried confections have, on record, silicone in them.
[02:10:37.566 --> 02:10:40.487]  They can call it an additive and have you eat it.
[02:10:40.487 --> 02:10:51.770]  So here is pharmacist Ben Fuchs to run through vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and key cofactors that, when you don't have them, they know is causing these debilitating disorders and diseases.
[02:10:51.770 --> 02:10:53.991]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, great to have you here today.
[02:10:53.991 --> 02:10:54.771]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:10:54.771 --> 02:10:55.311]  Appreciate it.
[02:10:56.203 --> 02:10:56.963]  You've got the floor.
[02:10:56.963 --> 02:10:57.844]  Start breaking it down.
[02:10:57.844 --> 02:11:02.846]  Yeah, well it's interesting that you brought up vitamin C first because truly vitamin C is the king of vitamins.
[02:11:02.846 --> 02:11:05.607]  It's so, so fundamental to health.
[02:11:05.607 --> 02:11:11.609]  It's pretty much impossible to think of a disease state or a breakdown state that vitamin C doesn't improve.
[02:11:11.609 --> 02:11:14.910]  The first thing that comes to mind with vitamin C deficiency is what you said, scurvy.
[02:11:14.910 --> 02:11:18.952]  But what's really important to understand about scurvy is the fact that you can have sub
[02:11:19.452 --> 02:11:19.572]  Yes.
[02:11:36.209 --> 02:11:37.170]  Make Collagen
[02:12:06.189 --> 02:12:06.590]  That's right.
[02:12:22.466 --> 02:12:25.647]  Hold on, hold your horses there, Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, or hold your rats, because
[02:12:49.998 --> 02:12:59.863]  The British manuals going back up to 300 years ago said if you can't find fresh green vegetables or fruits, eat rats.
[02:12:59.863 --> 02:13:09.228]  They had discovered that whatever was in the fruit was in the intestines of ship rats and that they would then gobble the guts of rats raw.
[02:13:09.228 --> 02:13:12.009]  So again, what you just said, most mammals produce it.
[02:13:12.009 --> 02:13:13.710]  Why don't we produce our own vitamin C?
[02:13:14.090 --> 02:13:18.393]  Everybody really knows why, but they think it has something to do with the fact that we were eating fruits and vegetables.
[02:13:18.393 --> 02:13:35.047]  It turns out that certain gorillas, certain forms of gorillas, human beings, and guinea pigs of all critters, are the only animals that don't make vitamin C. Squirrels make vitamin C, horses make vitamin C, goats make vitamin C, and what's really fascinating, Alex, is when an animal is under stress, it makes
[02:13:35.287 --> 02:13:35.547]  More
[02:13:51.278 --> 02:13:59.646]  More vitamin C. And this gets us to the whole topic of recommended daily allowances, the RDAs, which I call the Ridiculous Deficiency Allowance.
[02:13:59.646 --> 02:14:11.597]  The RDA of vitamin C, the Ridiculous Deficiency Allowance of vitamin C, according to the government, is 60 milligrams of vitamin C. A billy goat will make 100 times that much vitamin C when it's under stress.
[02:14:12.037 --> 02:14:17.542]  And it makes much more than the recommended daily allowance of vitamin C, even on a daily basis.
[02:14:17.542 --> 02:14:30.452]  This whole idea of vitamins being used simply to treat deficiency diseases is what gives rise to the recommended daily allowance that allows people to think, well, I'll just take this multiple vitamin with the RDAs and I'll be fine.
[02:14:30.452 --> 02:14:33.735]  Or I better not take more than the RDAs or I'll be in big trouble.
[02:14:33.735 --> 02:14:39.239]  Nothing speaks to this fallacy more than the idea that you only need 55 or 60 milligrams of vitamin C.
[02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:41.562]  So, your point's well taken.
[02:14:41.562 --> 02:14:44.446]  Animals are making their own vitamin C. We're not.
[02:14:44.446 --> 02:14:47.410]  That means you gotta be supplementing.
[02:14:47.410 --> 02:14:50.233]  It's going to be very difficult to get your vitamin C out of food.
[02:14:50.233 --> 02:14:55.640]  In fact, Alice, it's very difficult to get all of the vitamins you need from food anyway.
[02:14:55.640 --> 02:14:56.702]  For example, with vitamin E.
[02:14:57.262 --> 02:15:01.864]  The recommended daily allowance of vitamin E is 14 international units.
[02:15:01.864 --> 02:15:13.368]  Every study that's ever been done on the protective benefits of vitamin E show that you need 400 international units of vitamin E, and even the most vitamin E-dense foods are only going to give you about 40 international units.
[02:15:13.368 --> 02:15:22.371]  So, with vitamin E, with vitamin C, with the B-complex, you're not going to be able to get what you need from food, even under the best of circumstances.
[02:15:22.371 --> 02:15:26.293]  And this is why it's so, so important to supplement if you're healthy,
[02:15:26.813 --> 02:15:32.494]  And if you're sick, it is unspeakably important to get yourself on a good nutritional supplement program.
[02:15:32.494 --> 02:15:36.495]  So, vitamin C for the connective tissue in the body.
[02:15:36.495 --> 02:15:41.656]  By the way, bones, a lot of people are under the impression that all you need to do is take calcium for your bones.
[02:15:41.656 --> 02:15:53.259]  Well, as it turns out, your bones too are made of collagen, and vitamin C is way more important for the integrity of your bones via this collagen connection than calcium is.
[02:15:54.179 --> 02:16:01.141]  Many people call osteoporosis, the disease of bone breakdown, of weak bones, scurvy of the bones.
[02:16:01.141 --> 02:16:11.865]  If you have bleeding gums, if you have nosebleeds, if you have chronic bruising, if you have any kind of heart disease issues, not to mention osteoporosis and high blood pressure and joint,
[02:16:12.305 --> 02:16:12.525]  We're good!
[02:16:39.282 --> 02:16:41.323]  Get some vitamin C in your body.
[02:16:41.323 --> 02:16:45.204]  You can even use vitamin C topically as a cream and it's got wonderful benefits that way too.
[02:16:45.204 --> 02:16:48.725]  Oh no, I've been using this vitamin C facial cream my wife's got.
[02:16:48.725 --> 02:16:52.866]  It's awesome and I've really seen it make my skin a lot healthier.
[02:16:52.866 --> 02:17:02.348]  And obviously, Beyond Tangy Tangerine or PolymBurst Plus, things like that available at Infowarsteam.com.
[02:17:02.348 --> 02:17:04.569]  That would obviously be some of the best sources of vitamin C.
[02:17:05.129 --> 02:17:10.112]  Heck yes, you're getting a thousand milligrams of vitamin C per two scoops of the Beyond Tangy Tangerine.
[02:17:10.112 --> 02:17:15.334]  You know, here's the thing about the BTT, which you mentioned, the Beyond Tangy Tangerine and the Polymverse, they're liquid.
[02:17:15.334 --> 02:17:32.664]  And the rate limiting step in how much value you're going to get out of nutritional supplementation, if you understand how important nutritional supplementation is, and you don't have to do much reading to understand how important it is, then it becomes vital to recognize it's not so much what you're taking in, but it's what you're absorbing.
[02:17:32.664 --> 02:17:33.524]  And if you're one of the eight
[02:17:33.524 --> 02:17:39.845]  Eighty million or more Americans who are dealing with digestive issues, bile issues, gallbladder issues, gastritis, pancreatitis.
[02:17:39.845 --> 02:17:43.246]  You can take supplements, but you may not be getting the value of them.
[02:17:43.246 --> 02:17:43.866]  You may not be absorbing them.
[02:17:43.866 --> 02:17:50.867]  And you need those really big dosages, from what I've read and studied from yourself and others, to really have the full effect.
[02:17:50.867 --> 02:18:03.130]  But you'd have to drink two or three containers of orange juice to get the same vitamin C in a Beyond Tangy Tangerine scoop, and then you'd be getting all of that bad overload of fructose that attacks the liver and everything else.
[02:18:03.470 --> 02:18:05.351]  Not to mention the pesticides as well.
[02:18:05.351 --> 02:18:15.995]  So, now orange juice has got a very small amount of vitamin C. You get about 30 or 40 milligrams of vitamin C in a glass of orange juice and then of course you're exposing yourself to all that sugar and all those pesticides.
[02:18:15.995 --> 02:18:20.617]  One of the neat things about the Beyond Tangy Tangerine is the liquid format.
[02:18:20.617 --> 02:18:26.379]  And so if you're dealing with digestive distress but you understand you want to get on a nutritional supplement program, you understand how important it is,
[02:18:27.059 --> 02:18:29.820]  Please take a shot at liquid nutrition.
[02:18:29.820 --> 02:18:33.601]  Please take a shot at products like the Beyond Tangy Tangerine that will... Well, exactly.
[02:18:33.601 --> 02:18:41.144]  But expanding on that, expanding on that, it's got all the other vitamins, minerals, trace elements, cofactors together to supercharge it.
[02:18:41.144 --> 02:18:43.245]  And I want to talk about how things work together when we come back.
[02:18:43.245 --> 02:18:49.327]  But separately, folks, green leafy vegetables, berries, there's a lot of great ways to get vitamin C as well.
[02:18:49.867 --> 02:18:50.288]  I don't know.
[02:19:11.870 --> 02:19:13.211]  The vitamins and minerals you need.
[02:19:13.211 --> 02:19:15.952]  You don't have those cravings as bad anymore and you can lose the weight.
[02:19:15.952 --> 02:19:18.373]  But see, we've only covered one vitamin.
[02:19:18.373 --> 02:19:21.714]  Vitamin C, the King Daddy that I started with, that you started with.
[02:19:21.714 --> 02:19:22.674]  We didn't plan to do that.
[02:19:22.674 --> 02:19:24.235]  That was just, we're on the same page.
[02:19:24.235 --> 02:19:29.037]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, one of the top compounding pharmacists out there in the country.
[02:19:29.037 --> 02:19:30.077]  Syndicated talk show host.
[02:19:30.077 --> 02:19:31.878]  When we come back, let's race!
[02:19:32.498 --> 02:19:37.280]  Through the other vitamins, then the minerals, then trace elements, and key co-factors.
[02:19:37.280 --> 02:19:38.300]  Because I want to know this.
[02:19:38.300 --> 02:19:42.502]  I was listening to your show a few days ago and just riveted and I said, get me Ben Fuchs.
[02:19:42.502 --> 02:19:43.502]  And we talked off air.
[02:19:43.502 --> 02:19:45.383]  We got this whole file together.
[02:19:45.383 --> 02:19:48.404]  We just spent 20 minutes on one vitamin.
[02:19:48.404 --> 02:19:49.945]  Get your notepads ready.
[02:19:49.945 --> 02:19:55.567]  Because we're going to run down the line here with info Big Brother doesn't want you to know.
[02:19:56.247 --> 02:20:02.411]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:20:02.411 --> 02:20:05.353]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:20:05.353 --> 02:20:10.756]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:20:10.756 --> 02:20:15.719]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[02:20:15.719 --> 02:20:23.023]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods or meat foods direct now.
[02:20:23.343 --> 02:20:27.226]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices, too.
[02:20:27.226 --> 02:20:29.008]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:20:29.008 --> 02:20:33.031]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[02:20:33.031 --> 02:20:35.933]  You know about their delicious, long-term, storable foods.
[02:20:35.933 --> 02:20:38.715]  The fact is, you can eat at any time to save money today.
[02:20:38.715 --> 02:20:43.279]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:20:43.279 --> 02:20:43.939]  Don't wait!

[02:20:55.868 --> 02:20:59.911]  HempUSA.org brings you pure camembert powder.

[02:21:11.818 --> 02:21:24.062]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:24.062 --> 02:21:31.004]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:21:31.004 --> 02:21:36.826]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:21:36.826 --> 02:21:40.207]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:21:40.447 --> 02:21:43.170]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[02:21:55.201 --> 02:21:58.364]  My name is Frank Bates, and I've got some urgent news for you.
[02:21:58.364 --> 02:22:02.828]  Did you know that a solar storm in 1989 caused an enormous blackout in Quebec?
[02:22:02.828 --> 02:22:03.969]  Here's the really bad news.
[02:22:04.509 --> 02:22:11.057]  Experts are predicting that solar storms will get really severe over the next year and our electric grid is extremely vulnerable.
[02:22:11.057 --> 02:22:19.768]  In fact, the Wall Street Journal reported that we could soon face blackouts lasting weeks or months, leaving major parts of the USA temporarily uninhabitable.
[02:22:20.248 --> 02:22:22.430]  Are you prepared for this coming crisis?

[02:22:55.370 --> 02:23:00.175]  Alex Jones here with a message that could revolutionize health in this country.
[02:23:00.175 --> 02:23:06.422]  Going back about a year and a half ago, I began to learn about the incredible health effects of longevity products.
[02:23:06.422 --> 02:23:09.165]  Erin Dykes lost 92 pounds.
[02:23:09.165 --> 02:23:12.049]  We're going to show you some before and afters.
[02:23:12.469 --> 02:23:14.270]  Aaron, break down what happened.
[02:23:14.270 --> 02:23:15.111]  Your story.
[02:23:15.111 --> 02:23:20.234]  I've worked really hard with diet and exercise to try to lose weight, but I just didn't get the results.
[02:23:20.234 --> 02:23:21.394]  It just didn't happen.
[02:23:21.394 --> 02:23:24.456]  Then I saw what you were doing with Infowarsteam.com.
[02:23:24.456 --> 02:23:28.299]  I wasn't even trying to lose weight, but I got it because I wanted to feel better energy.
[02:23:28.299 --> 02:23:29.279]  I wanted that nutrition.
[02:23:29.279 --> 02:23:35.143]  Didn't even understand how that could kickstart my own weight loss goals, but the products did that for me.
[02:23:35.143 --> 02:23:36.984]  I found myself suddenly losing weight.
[02:23:37.384 --> 02:23:43.209]  More energetic, wanting to exercise, wanting to eat the right foods, and they don't even advertise it as weight loss!
[02:23:43.209 --> 02:23:52.476]  I want to challenge our radio listeners to go to infowarsteam.com, sign up as a distributor, and get wholesale pricing discounts at infowarsteam.com.
[02:24:07.023 --> 02:24:21.367]  So, when old folks go in with Alzheimer's and big rotholes in their arms where their skin is falling apart and their teeth have all fallen out, the doctors don't say, hey, you have scurvy.
[02:24:21.367 --> 02:24:25.648]  They just send them home to rot and die.
[02:24:25.648 --> 02:24:29.569]  Because Big Pharma doesn't make money if they say, hey, go eat some blueberries.
[02:24:31.587 --> 02:24:36.613]  Or go take naturally derived, say, you know, rose hemp vitamin C or something.
[02:24:36.613 --> 02:24:37.594]  Don't, you know, it doesn't matter.
[02:24:37.594 --> 02:24:44.943]  Linus Pauling won two Nobel Prizes, one of them for discovering how powerful, I mean, the vitamin C is magic.
[02:24:44.943 --> 02:24:48.067]  This is a short six-minute segment, long segment coming up.
[02:24:48.067 --> 02:24:49.388]  Okay, pharmacist Ben Fuchs.
[02:24:50.253 --> 02:24:58.180]  We're going to post this video, this interview at Infowarsteam.com if anybody's listening on the radio and wants to see the video of it and some of the documents we're going to be going over.
[02:24:58.180 --> 02:25:02.824]  It'll be posted by tomorrow at Infowarsteam.com.
[02:25:02.824 --> 02:25:07.608]  Continue, let's race through the other vitamins right now and what they're directly linked to if you don't have them.
[02:25:08.388 --> 02:25:20.697]  Vitamin E, brain health, dry skin, these are deficiencies in vitamin E. Vitamin E deficiencies are associated with problems with thinking, with brain problems, with dementias, with macular degeneration, with eye disease, with impotence, with infertility.
[02:25:20.697 --> 02:25:23.439]  By the way, there's an infertility epidemic in this country.
[02:25:23.439 --> 02:25:26.281]  Vitamin E is known as the fertility vitamin.
[02:25:26.281 --> 02:25:30.424]  The technical name for vitamin E is tocopherol, which means to bear children.
[02:25:30.424 --> 02:25:34.587]  Deficiencies in vitamin E are associated with prostate disease, another epidemic.
[02:25:34.707 --> 02:25:40.788]  Deficiencies in vitamin E can cause skin problems like hyperpigmentation, dark spots, another seeming epidemic.
[02:25:40.788 --> 02:25:44.729]  Then there's the B-complex, which is a series of vitamins that are found in nature.
[02:25:44.729 --> 02:25:46.690]  The B-complex are the energy vitamins.
[02:25:46.690 --> 02:25:53.411]  If you're feeling sluggish, if you're feeling lethargic, if you have brain fog, all of these are associated with B-complex deficiencies.
[02:25:53.411 --> 02:25:56.512]  The more sugar you eat, the more deficient you're going to be.
[02:25:57.052 --> 02:26:10.491]  In key B vitamins, there's a B vitamin that is so fundamental for brain health that Dr. Abram Hoffer wrote a book called Orthomolecular Psychiatry, talking about treating schizophrenia successfully using nothing but... That's B12!
[02:26:10.491 --> 02:26:12.214]  That's B3, vitamin B12 is on your... B12, I'm sorry!
[02:26:12.594 --> 02:26:12.954]  That's right.
[02:26:27.719 --> 02:26:30.501]  Low stomach acid issues, you're going to have problems absorbing B12.
[02:26:30.501 --> 02:26:39.828]  Vitamin B3, by the way, is wonderful for treating social anxiety disorder or jitteriness or just generalized anxiety deficiencies.
[02:26:39.828 --> 02:26:44.411]  Vitamin B3 are associated with brain fog, learning disabilities, cholesterol.
[02:26:44.411 --> 02:26:45.592]  It's a more powerful...
[02:26:46.312 --> 02:26:46.612]  I think?
[02:27:04.358 --> 02:27:12.184]  It's associated, deficiencies are associated with diabetes, with poor sugar control, with high blood pressure, with multiple sclerosis, with cardiovascular disease.
[02:27:12.184 --> 02:27:19.410]  This is like a who's who of all the diseases that we're dealing with and they're all associated with nutritional deficiencies.
[02:27:19.410 --> 02:27:22.713]  Vitamin K deficiencies associated with bruising, the formation of stones.
[02:27:22.713 --> 02:27:24.875]  And by the way, you're not just saying this.
[02:27:25.575 --> 02:27:36.580]  Right now, this is admitted, and the people they put on Coumadin, they tell them not to eat green vegetables, which has the vitamin K, and then the rotholes are all in their skin, their skin's falling off.
[02:27:36.580 --> 02:27:38.241]  They're literally being murdered.
[02:27:38.241 --> 02:27:39.342]  This is not your opinion.
[02:27:39.342 --> 02:27:40.822]  They've known this for hundreds of years.
[02:27:40.822 --> 02:27:41.423]  Please continue.
[02:27:42.604 --> 02:27:44.285]  It's absolutely correct, by the way.
[02:27:44.285 --> 02:27:51.972]  When they put you on Coumadin, they tell you not to eat any vitamin K-containing foods, including broccoli and cauliflower, anything that's got vitamin K in it.
[02:27:51.972 --> 02:27:53.213]  Same with vitamin E, by the way.
[02:27:53.213 --> 02:28:02.562]  After surgery, and even before surgery, vitamin E is such an effective blood thinner that they'll tell you not to take vitamin E. Why don't they give you vitamin E instead of the Coumadin?
[02:28:02.562 --> 02:28:06.906]  That's a whole other... Instead of the medications, that's a whole other question.
[02:28:06.906 --> 02:28:07.667]  Anyway, vitamin A.
[02:28:08.167 --> 02:28:08.547]  I think?
[02:28:25.794 --> 02:28:25.994]  I think?
[02:28:43.974 --> 02:28:57.904]  I know multiple women who are pretty young who have the epidemic of their hair falling out because they're on diets and all this stuff, that their hair came back when they were on Beyond Tangy Tangerine for six months.
[02:28:57.904 --> 02:29:00.426]  I mean, the hair came back.
[02:29:00.426 --> 02:29:01.327]  I watched it.
[02:29:03.049 --> 02:29:04.090]  That's not surprising to me.
[02:29:04.090 --> 02:29:09.073]  You're getting a healthy dose of nutrients, and you're getting them in a liquid format, easy-to-absorb fashion.
[02:29:09.073 --> 02:29:14.377]  That's the neat thing, by the way, about the Beyond Tangy Tangerine and liquid nutrition, is you notice results quickly.
[02:29:14.377 --> 02:29:16.759]  This isn't like a 30-day kind of thing.
[02:29:16.759 --> 02:29:20.822]  You notice results in days, sometimes in doses, sometimes in one or two doses.
[02:29:20.822 --> 02:29:23.444]  And the great thing about the human body in deficiency states
[02:29:23.884 --> 02:29:28.566]  Is the more deficient you are, the faster your body responds.
[02:29:28.566 --> 02:29:31.967]  The more weight you need to lose, the faster you'll lose the weight.
[02:29:31.967 --> 02:29:36.089]  The more nutritionally deficient you are, the faster your body will absorb the nutrients.
[02:29:36.089 --> 02:29:41.251]  That means the sicker you are... Oh yeah, people that are really skinny gain weight on it.
[02:29:41.251 --> 02:29:43.272]  Your body knows what to do with these tools.
[02:29:43.272 --> 02:29:46.793]  We'll be back with the rest of Vitamins... We're on the march.
[02:29:46.793 --> 02:29:48.413]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:48.413 --> 02:29:51.995]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:55.990 --> 02:30:02.136]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:30:02.136 --> 02:30:05.099]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:30:05.099 --> 02:30:10.485]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:30:10.485 --> 02:30:15.190]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[02:30:15.450 --> 02:30:23.097]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[02:30:23.097 --> 02:30:26.961]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[02:30:26.961 --> 02:30:28.763]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:30:28.763 --> 02:30:32.786]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we have all known this was coming.
[02:30:32.786 --> 02:30:35.389]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:30:35.669 --> 02:30:38.451]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[02:30:38.451 --> 02:30:43.014]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food costs.
[02:30:43.014 --> 02:30:43.675]  Don't wait!
[02:30:43.675 --> 02:30:45.376]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash alex.
[02:30:45.376 --> 02:30:47.137]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash alex.
[02:30:47.137 --> 02:30:48.678]  You can bet your life on efoods direct.
[02:30:55.783 --> 02:31:01.287]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[02:31:01.287 --> 02:31:03.689]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[02:31:03.689 --> 02:31:12.795]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[02:31:12.795 --> 02:31:16.238]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:31:16.238 --> 02:31:17.919]  There's no priming required.
[02:31:17.919 --> 02:31:20.201]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[02:31:20.201 --> 02:31:22.702]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[02:31:23.763 --> 02:31:25.284]  Easy to set up and use.
[02:31:25.284 --> 02:31:26.705]  Doesn't require electricity.
[02:31:26.705 --> 02:31:29.868]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:31:29.868 --> 02:31:33.251]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:31:33.251 --> 02:31:37.414]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:31:37.414 --> 02:31:40.136]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:31:40.136 --> 02:31:41.718]  It's what my family uses.
[02:31:41.718 --> 02:31:45.040]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[02:31:45.040 --> 02:31:50.285]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.

[02:31:55.886 --> 02:31:59.387]  Supernatural silver is not an ionic or a colloidal silver.
[02:31:59.387 --> 02:32:05.348]  It is a nanocatalytic silver cell technology with superior benefits to the colloidal silvers of yesterday.
[02:32:05.348 --> 02:32:08.669]  This new molecular structure is permanently bonded to water.
[02:32:08.669 --> 02:32:14.970]  It is the only water-soluble silver that is 99% bioavailable and non-toxic with no known side effects.
[02:32:15.490 --> 02:32:23.478]  SilverSol's patented technology has advanced antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties with a 15-year shelf life.
[02:32:23.478 --> 02:32:29.623]  It can be used internally as well as topically and is one of the most important items needed in any emergency.
[02:32:29.623 --> 02:32:36.370]  Independent testing from universities, hospitals, military, and private labs make this the most proven product in the industry.
[02:32:36.770 --> 02:32:39.331]  No silver solution is better or safer.
[02:32:39.331 --> 02:32:42.232]  Protect yourself and your loved ones and be prepared.

[02:33:13.875 --> 02:33:16.958]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:16.958 --> 02:33:20.502]  Crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:20.502 --> 02:33:22.844]  Monday through Friday from 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[02:33:22.844 --> 02:33:23.284]  Eastern.
[02:33:23.284 --> 02:33:27.348]  Back on the radio Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:33:27.348 --> 02:33:28.790]  And don't forget weeknights.
[02:33:29.941 --> 02:33:44.896]  Five nights a week, seven o'clock central, eight o'clock eastern, InfoWars Nightly News, where you'll find me, Alex Jones, and my incredible crew of out-of-control, rampaging liberty lovers.
[02:33:44.896 --> 02:33:46.778]  We will not stand down.
[02:33:46.778 --> 02:33:48.840]  We will not back down.
[02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:49.601]  We will not
[02:33:54.428 --> 02:33:55.348]  To the cry of war!
[02:33:55.348 --> 02:34:01.450]  Louder than before!
[02:34:01.450 --> 02:34:05.971]  With the sword of truth, we control the land!
[02:34:05.971 --> 02:34:18.294]  Yeah, we're gonna drag the Phantom Lord of the New World Order out by a shirt tail and with God's help, throw him right into the pit when the Archangel ties him up in chains.
[02:34:21.340 --> 02:34:22.341]  Listen to this part right here.
[02:34:22.341 --> 02:34:27.686]  Some poetry right there.
[02:34:27.686 --> 02:34:30.449]  Alright, let's go back to Ben Fuchs.
[02:34:30.449 --> 02:34:31.250]  It's hard to turn that off.
[02:34:34.861 --> 02:34:35.962]  Let me tell you something, folks.
[02:34:35.962 --> 02:34:40.008]  I promote what I believe in, and I'm going to do a plug right here for the Longevity products.
[02:34:40.008 --> 02:34:40.588]  Discounted.
[02:34:40.588 --> 02:34:47.537]  If you sign up for $10, like Costco, you get discounts at Infowarsteam.com, and your purchase supports us.
[02:34:47.537 --> 02:34:50.981]  They've got the Just Out with my ugly face on the cover.
[02:34:52.455 --> 02:34:52.956]  I think so.
[02:35:08.933 --> 02:35:09.593]  877-551-1301.
[02:35:09.593 --> 02:35:10.114]  877-551-1301.
[02:35:10.114 --> 02:35:24.582]  If you want to call and be a distributor or got any questions or want to talk to some of the folks at the InfoWars team, a lot of people that end up being distributors end up working for the crew here.
[02:35:24.582 --> 02:35:28.164]  This stuff is taking the country by storm through our radio show.
[02:35:28.164 --> 02:35:34.188]  I know that it's boosted the overall longevity sales period outside of what I'm doing about 35% last year.
[02:35:34.188 --> 02:35:37.090]  Because people buy what really works.
[02:35:37.950 --> 02:35:38.691]  Okay.
[02:35:38.691 --> 02:35:40.313]  Again, I've been promoting this two years.
[02:35:40.313 --> 02:35:41.214]  Knew it was good.
[02:35:41.214 --> 02:35:43.357]  Didn't really... It stuck my toe in, though.
[02:35:43.357 --> 02:35:54.792]  It was just another sponsorship of something I believed in, but I wasn't... What I saw with Aaron, and then my family, and my mother, who's a triathlete, and everybody else, and then women I know whose hair was falling out, and the hair came back in...
[02:35:56.034 --> 02:35:58.796]  I mean, because it wasn't a hormonal issue, it was a nutrient thing.
[02:35:58.796 --> 02:36:00.038]  Nails growing faster.
[02:36:00.038 --> 02:36:07.085]  I don't want to get into personal stuff, but I never had a really oily skin, but I get some, you know, blackheads and stuff.
[02:36:07.085 --> 02:36:08.446]  Just almost gone.
[02:36:08.446 --> 02:36:11.409]  I mean, really dramatic effects.
[02:36:11.409 --> 02:36:14.813]  The only problem is I feel like I'm 18 again, and I'm being super aggressive.
[02:36:15.626 --> 02:36:20.029]  I mean, super aggressive where I'm just ready to get in fights almost instantly.
[02:36:20.029 --> 02:36:21.990]  But that's, most people doesn't do that, okay?
[02:36:21.990 --> 02:36:23.691]  That's just how I am, okay?
[02:36:23.691 --> 02:36:25.552]  I've always been aggressive.
[02:36:25.552 --> 02:36:30.756]  And going back to Ben Fuchs, I know a lot of these, having this mix also has boosted my testosterone.
[02:36:30.756 --> 02:36:34.618]  Naturally, I'm not going to get into how I know that's happened.
[02:36:34.618 --> 02:36:38.821]  But men know when you've got a boost in testosterone, how you know that.
[02:36:38.821 --> 02:36:39.922]  The point is, this is real.
[02:36:40.382 --> 02:36:41.984]  Now, can you do this through other products?
[02:36:41.984 --> 02:36:43.526]  Yeah, it'll cost you more.
[02:36:43.526 --> 02:36:44.448]  We've even looked at it.
[02:36:44.448 --> 02:36:48.794]  It costs a lot more to try to get everything you get in just a few longevity products.
[02:36:48.794 --> 02:36:55.523]  The Alex Pack with the Osteo FX, the Essential Fatty Acids, the Biontangy Tangerine, the Polymers Plus.
[02:36:55.523 --> 02:36:56.604]  You do that, you get everything.
[02:36:57.205 --> 02:37:00.927]  They've got a lot of other little specialty cofactors and things, and I'm gonna stop plugging now.
[02:37:00.927 --> 02:37:02.247]  That's not why Ben Fuchs is on.
[02:37:02.247 --> 02:37:04.088]  We could do two hours on this.
[02:37:04.088 --> 02:37:13.293]  You can get clean water, you can get the basic vitamins, basic minerals, huge dosages of vitamin C, and just see what it does for you.
[02:37:13.293 --> 02:37:14.793]  Try some other company.
[02:37:14.793 --> 02:37:15.694]  Just, just please!
[02:37:16.576 --> 02:37:19.599]  In fact, Ben, before we get back to the minerals and vitamins, we've covered about 10% of them.
[02:37:19.599 --> 02:37:21.240]  We've got a race now.
[02:37:21.240 --> 02:37:24.303]  Because I've heard you talk about this specifically.
[02:37:24.303 --> 02:37:33.231]  I've found that if I drink more clean water as well, that that's essential, and I've seen that help family before I even woke up to this other stuff.
[02:37:33.231 --> 02:37:39.517]  You know, I had, like, great uncles and people who I'd sit there and watch drinking coffee and tea all day, and I said, do you drink water?
[02:37:40.427 --> 02:37:41.448]  And they can hardly get out of their chair.
[02:37:41.448 --> 02:37:42.109]  They're like, no.
[02:37:42.109 --> 02:37:43.270]  And I go, you're all shriveled up.
[02:37:43.270 --> 02:37:44.371]  You're dehydrated.
[02:37:44.371 --> 02:37:45.632]  Do you know that's a diuretic?
[02:37:45.632 --> 02:37:48.174]  I don't want to hear it.
[02:37:48.174 --> 02:37:53.359]  I'm like, hey, listen, you know, I brought him literature, said, if you want to feel better, do this.
[02:37:53.359 --> 02:37:55.281]  And it was like a new person just off water.
[02:37:55.281 --> 02:37:56.962]  So we're not selling water, by the way.
[02:37:56.962 --> 02:37:58.524]  We think you should purify it.
[02:37:58.524 --> 02:38:01.126]  I mean, but there's a lot of stuff hidden in plain view.
[02:38:01.126 --> 02:38:02.527]  The system knows this.
[02:38:02.527 --> 02:38:04.830]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, how important is water?
[02:38:05.650 --> 02:38:06.651]  Please.
[02:38:06.651 --> 02:38:08.731]  More water means more blood.
[02:38:08.731 --> 02:38:14.394]  More blood means more oxygen and more nutrition and you don't need to know anything more than that.
[02:38:14.394 --> 02:38:16.515]  Especially, by the way, first thing in the morning.
[02:38:16.515 --> 02:38:23.278]  First thing in the morning we tend to be dehydrated because usually we've gone to the bathroom once or twice and we haven't replaced our fluids for six or eight hours.
[02:38:23.278 --> 02:38:25.499]  So first thing in the morning you're dehydrated.
[02:38:25.939 --> 02:38:31.800]  When you drink more water, immediately, within moments, you have more blood volume.
[02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:34.441]  More blood volume means more nutrients and more oxygen.
[02:38:34.441 --> 02:38:39.002]  And by the way, for diabetics, drinking more water is absolutely vital.
[02:38:39.002 --> 02:38:42.702]  And we know 30% of Americans are either pre-diabetic or diabetic.
[02:38:42.702 --> 02:38:46.903]  Drinking more water will dilute your blood sugar too.
[02:38:46.903 --> 02:38:48.844]  So if you're having blood sugar issues... So it's the garbage man.
[02:38:48.844 --> 02:38:50.444]  It helps carry away all the trash.
[02:38:51.411 --> 02:38:57.336]  It makes your blood volume higher and it delivers more nutrients to your tissues.
[02:38:57.336 --> 02:39:07.926]  When you have high blood pressure, by the way, and almost 80 to 100 million Americans are dealing with high blood pressure issues, that's a sign that your body is trying to deliver more nutrients and more oxygen to the tissues.
[02:39:08.426 --> 02:39:17.435]  Simply drinking more water, by virtue of the fact that it will deliver more nutrients to your body's cells, will allow your blood pressure to relax.
[02:39:17.435 --> 02:39:22.259]  So drinking more water is important for brain health, it's important for nutrient delivery, it's important for detoxification.
[02:39:22.259 --> 02:39:29.205]  But that doesn't make big pharma, who happen to be eugenicists, more money, so they don't ever tell you about that at the doctor's office.
[02:39:29.205 --> 02:39:32.789]  Let's continue with the vitamins, minerals, trace elements, cofactors.
[02:39:32.789 --> 02:39:33.429]  Race through them.
[02:39:34.270 --> 02:39:36.151]  EFAs, essential fatty acids.
[02:39:36.151 --> 02:39:40.233]  I don't know if you could come up with one supplement that's more important than essential fatty acids.
[02:39:40.233 --> 02:39:43.995]  They are a must-have nutritional supplement.
[02:39:43.995 --> 02:39:47.157]  They're very difficult to get out of foods because of processing.
[02:39:47.157 --> 02:39:50.999]  Deficiencies in EFAs will wreak havoc on your hormone system.
[02:39:50.999 --> 02:39:53.020]  It'll wreak havoc on your skin.
[02:39:53.020 --> 02:39:54.861]  You cannot make collagen for your skin.
[02:39:54.861 --> 02:39:58.463]  Like with vitamin C, you can't make collagen without essential fatty acids.
[02:39:58.463 --> 02:39:59.564]  You can't make the skin's
[02:39:59.724 --> 02:40:00.424]  We're good to go!
[02:40:23.112 --> 02:40:32.824]  That's one of the neat things about nutritional supplementation is it will allow you to wean yourself off of foods that you know are bad for you, but that you cannot resist.
[02:40:32.824 --> 02:40:41.134]  Food manufacturers and chemical companies understand that under conditions of nutritional deficiencies, we won't be able to stop eating the french fries.
[02:40:41.474 --> 02:40:42.394]  Well, yeah, that's Aaron.
[02:40:42.394 --> 02:40:44.315]  Aaron lost 92 pounds over a year.
[02:40:44.315 --> 02:40:49.357]  He's now six months into keeping it off, but now his muscles are building up.
[02:40:49.357 --> 02:40:52.458]  And, I mean, he literally has had a total transformation.
[02:40:52.458 --> 02:40:55.500]  The video of that is now posted at Infowarsteam.com.
[02:40:55.500 --> 02:41:01.582]  We aired it on the radio yesterday, but for people that want to see the before and after, it's at Infowarsteam.com.
[02:41:01.582 --> 02:41:02.883]  Just posted there last night.
[02:41:04.335 --> 02:41:06.256]  You don't even talk about weight loss.
[02:41:06.256 --> 02:41:11.560]  He said whenever he was craving pizza or whatever, he just would take essential fatty acids.
[02:41:11.560 --> 02:41:12.061]  Go ahead.
[02:41:12.061 --> 02:41:13.642]  That's exactly right.
[02:41:13.642 --> 02:41:17.225]  When you're craving fats, that's your body's cry for good fats.
[02:41:17.225 --> 02:41:25.211]  Your body doesn't have a cry for french fry fats, but it has a loud cry for essential fatty acids and we just don't listen or understand or interpret
[02:41:25.971 --> 02:41:26.772]  I've started doing that!
[02:41:50.228 --> 02:41:54.051]  I've started doing that because I sleep pretty good, but the dogs bark, the kids wake up.
[02:41:54.051 --> 02:42:04.800]  If I take a teaspoon of this magnesium stuff that I've gotten from yongevity, it literally, I sleep like the dead, where you just wake up in the morning, boom, you know, that deep sleep.
[02:42:04.800 --> 02:42:06.322]  It is, it's a drug.
[02:42:06.322 --> 02:42:07.202]  That's what they don't tell you.
[02:42:07.202 --> 02:42:14.749]  The vitamins and minerals are the real drugs that are natural, that our body's designed to get, and the pimps don't want us knowing that.
[02:42:14.749 --> 02:42:16.850]  They sell us manipulated garbage.
[02:42:17.651 --> 02:42:18.892]  Well, that's a brilliant point.
[02:42:18.892 --> 02:42:21.393]  Nutrients are what drugs dream they could be.
[02:42:21.393 --> 02:42:29.017]  When a drug goes to bed at night and has a fantasy, it fantasizes that it's a nutrient, because nutrients give you benefits with no toxicities.
[02:42:29.017 --> 02:42:34.280]  This is a medicinal dream come true, to have benefits with no toxicities.
[02:42:34.280 --> 02:42:44.006]  If a pharmaceutical company could find a drug that was as powerful as vitamin C, that had all the benefits of vitamin C, or any vitamin or mineral, but had no side effects, what would that drug be worth?
[02:42:44.426 --> 02:42:53.250]  What would a drug be worth that could lower your blood pressure, that could fight cancer, that could boost your immune system, that could build bone, among many other things, and have zero toxicity?
[02:42:53.250 --> 02:42:54.411]  Can you name a drug like that?
[02:42:54.411 --> 02:42:56.992]  There's no drug on planet Earth that can do anything like that.
[02:42:56.992 --> 02:43:05.796]  Well, what they're doing is they're coming and adding a molecule, or something to the molecule, and they are starting to patent fish oils and things, and they're making you pay ten times more.
[02:43:06.656 --> 02:43:07.196]  That's right.
[02:43:07.196 --> 02:43:09.577]  You see, a cell depends on nutrients.
[02:43:09.577 --> 02:43:12.098]  Nutrients are a cell's support system.
[02:43:12.098 --> 02:43:13.859]  Nutrients are like the cavalry.
[02:43:13.859 --> 02:43:15.380]  They carry the forces of life.
[02:43:15.380 --> 02:43:17.180]  Drugs are like Darth Vader.
[02:43:17.180 --> 02:43:19.461]  Drugs force a cell to do their bidding.
[02:43:19.461 --> 02:43:22.523]  All supposedly in the interest of a greater good.
[02:43:22.523 --> 02:43:24.323]  Drugs are like communist dictators.
[02:43:24.323 --> 02:43:25.444]  They're like Mao.
[02:43:25.444 --> 02:43:30.566]  They do, they, supposedly in the interest of the greater good of the body, they poison the individual cells.
[02:43:30.566 --> 02:43:32.647]  Nutrients are like your family.
[02:43:32.647 --> 02:43:33.107]  Nutrients
[02:43:33.407 --> 02:43:34.327]  We're good to go!
[02:43:59.099 --> 02:44:02.961]  Poison control system in the body, which is impeccable.
[02:44:02.961 --> 02:44:06.123]  This whole idea of drugs being handled this way has two important implications.
[02:44:06.123 --> 02:44:10.365]  Number one, it depletes your bodies of nutrients.
[02:44:10.365 --> 02:44:15.648]  The more prescription drugs you're taking, the more nutritional deficiencies you will have.
[02:44:15.648 --> 02:44:17.689]  Nutrients are typically not replaced.
[02:44:18.169 --> 02:44:24.852]  And also, secondly, focusing on drugs makes it more likely that not all other things will get cleared out.
[02:44:24.852 --> 02:44:36.357]  If your poison control system is overwhelmed from detoxifying your statin drugs or from detoxifying your antibiotics or detoxifying whatever medications you're on... Your immune system turns off and you get cancer.
[02:44:37.117 --> 02:44:41.478]  You'll be depleting your body's ability to handle these cancer-causing substances.
[02:44:41.478 --> 02:44:45.680]  You're going to be depleting your impeccable poison control system's energy.
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:52.121]  You'll be increasing the risks of poisons being built up, and even worse, you're going to be building up toxic intermediaries.
[02:44:52.121 --> 02:44:55.602]  And this is a point that's missed when we hear about drugs.
[02:44:55.602 --> 02:44:57.263]  We hear about side effects, and they're hideous.
[02:44:57.683 --> 02:45:02.064]  But even worse, you're depleting your body's ability to handle poisons.
[02:45:02.064 --> 02:45:05.985]  You're depleting your body's ability to handle cancer-causing substances.
[02:45:05.985 --> 02:45:13.326]  You're depleting your body's ability to handle substances that cause disease, and you may not even make the connection between the two.
[02:45:13.326 --> 02:45:17.867]  There's not a single drug on planet Earth that can heal anything in the body.
[02:45:17.867 --> 02:45:22.128]  They are simply there to change test markers and to eliminate symptoms.
[02:45:22.128 --> 02:45:24.829]  On the other hand, by using nutritional supplements,
[02:45:24.989 --> 02:45:28.090]  You can literally reverse the disease process.
[02:45:28.090 --> 02:45:30.131]  That's the beauty of good nutrition.
[02:45:30.131 --> 02:45:32.352]  And that's why I'm a nutritional pharmacist, Alex.
[02:45:32.352 --> 02:45:38.134]  That's why I practice nutrition instead of dispensing toxic pharmaceutical drugs.
[02:45:38.134 --> 02:45:42.415]  Because nutrients are the quintessential premier medicines.
[02:45:42.415 --> 02:45:46.417]  They are the very definition of what a medicine should be, with no toxicity.
[02:45:48.038 --> 02:46:09.386]  Alright, continuing here, let's get into, we've gotten into magnesium, we've gotten into fatty acids, let's get into selenium, then let's get into other minerals, cofactors, and some of the things from your research and other major studies, some of the other things that have been found that really supercharge things and help your body use all of these things in concert.
[02:46:10.146 --> 02:46:10.667]  Thank you!
[02:46:29.628 --> 02:46:29.728]  It's
[02:46:49.155 --> 02:46:50.156]  You're hypothyroid.
[02:46:50.156 --> 02:46:53.158]  You definitely want to think about getting on selenium.
[02:46:53.158 --> 02:46:56.040]  Selenium deficiency is associated with muscle weakness.
[02:46:56.040 --> 02:46:57.281]  It's associated with fatigue.
[02:46:57.281 --> 02:46:59.302]  It's associated with joint disease.
[02:46:59.302 --> 02:47:02.985]  Selenium deficiency can cause miscarriages and birth defects.
[02:47:02.985 --> 02:47:12.391]  And perhaps most importantly, selenium deficiency is associated with cardiovascular disease, which is the leading killer in this country and around the world.
[02:47:12.391 --> 02:47:14.533]  And you don't need very much selenium.
[02:47:14.533 --> 02:47:17.675]  Just the amount of selenium that would fit on a couple of pinheads
[02:47:18.175 --> 02:47:22.796]  Is all you need is a daily dose to assure that you don't suffer from these deficiency diseases.
[02:47:22.796 --> 02:47:27.098]  That's a tiny, tiny little bit of this very important substance, selenium.
[02:47:27.098 --> 02:47:40.522]  And selenium is one that you can take too much of and that's why when you're taking, when you're using a nutritional supplement program, something like the Beyond Tangy Tangerine, you don't have to concern yourself with the doses as much because the formulators have taken care of those dosages for you.
[02:47:40.782 --> 02:47:45.663]  Alright, let's talk about this, and then I want to go into some of the current news items that you wanted to mention.
[02:47:45.663 --> 02:47:53.685]  And there's other key co-factors and things like what you were just mentioning, but why are they attacking eggs and even whey protein?
[02:47:53.685 --> 02:47:55.365]  I guess they don't want us healthy.
[02:47:55.365 --> 02:48:02.567]  LA Times says eating whole eggs is dangerous as smoking, but then our brain is mainly made out of these good cholesterols.
[02:48:02.567 --> 02:48:05.528]  Is it true that we should be on a low-fat diet?
[02:48:06.104 --> 02:48:18.495]  Well, even Ancel Keys, who's the father of the so-called fat and cholesterol hypothesis, has come out saying that we've known all along that dietary cholesterol has nothing to do with the amount of cholesterol in your body.
[02:48:18.495 --> 02:48:22.639]  This whole thing on eggs, I'm going to talk about this on my program tomorrow, this whole thing on eggs is
[02:48:22.919 --> 02:48:24.059]  Absolutely tragic.
[02:48:24.059 --> 02:48:30.602]  If anybody listens to this silliness that's coming out of this study in Canada, it's very, very unfortunate.
[02:48:30.602 --> 02:48:43.627]  First of all, if you look at the numbers, and you've got to be very careful with how the press reports things, if you look at the numbers right out of the study, as it turns out, people who ate the highest amount of eggs had exactly the same cholesterol, even
[02:48:44.487 --> 02:48:48.992]  Higher cholesterol levels than people who ate less eggs.
[02:48:48.992 --> 02:48:54.377]  So this whole idea of eating egg yolks and causing cancer, this is just a bunch of hooey.
[02:48:54.377 --> 02:48:59.202]  The egg yolk is nature's richest source of nutrients next to human mother's milk.
[02:48:59.822 --> 02:49:01.083]  And not in the white.
[02:49:01.083 --> 02:49:02.924]  The nutrients are not in the white when it comes to an egg.
[02:49:02.924 --> 02:49:03.904]  They're in the yolk.
[02:49:03.904 --> 02:49:06.526]  And I'm talking vitamin A. I'm talking the B-complex.
[02:49:06.526 --> 02:49:09.748]  I'm talking vitamin K. I'm talking essential fatty acids.
[02:49:09.748 --> 02:49:14.090]  Magnesium, calcium, vitamin D, copper, iron, manganese, selenium, zinc.
[02:49:14.090 --> 02:49:15.231]  These are all in the yolk.
[02:49:15.231 --> 02:49:20.013]  Well, they even tell people that have epilepsy, eat more eggs because it's been associated with helping the brain.
[02:49:20.013 --> 02:49:21.894]  I mean, this is known.
[02:49:21.894 --> 02:49:22.935]  So why are they...
[02:49:23.715 --> 02:49:27.897]  I mean, if they're going to put taxes on cigarettes, I guess now they're saying eggs are bad.
[02:49:27.897 --> 02:49:29.938]  Bloomberg wants to tax salt.
[02:49:29.938 --> 02:49:34.761]  He wants to tax soft drinks.
[02:49:34.761 --> 02:49:38.442]  Again, making themselves the good guys while ignoring all the real problems.
[02:49:38.442 --> 02:49:39.743]  Are they doing that?
[02:49:39.743 --> 02:49:44.105]  Knowing they're killing us with an anti-state so that they can selectively take control?
[02:49:46.106 --> 02:49:50.130]  Yeah, that's a point that's well taken, but you know what, we've got to take the control back.
[02:49:50.130 --> 02:49:57.057]  This idea of nutritional supplementation is one of the best ways that you can take charge of your health and not depend on the doctor.
[02:49:57.057 --> 02:50:08.008]  And Alex, what's going to happen if we end up with this Obamacare thing, with managed care, government mandated managed care, government mandated HMOs, this is going to be an
[02:50:08.268 --> 02:50:13.313]  Unmitigated health disaster and our best protection is to understand how to use nutritional supplementation.
[02:50:13.313 --> 02:50:31.610]  And by the way, as far as this study goes on, egg yolks, look to see who the scientists who came up with this study, Dr. David Spence, the Canadian authors, David Spence and David Jenkins and Gene Davignon, see who these guys get paid for and guess who you will find is writing the checks?
[02:50:32.310 --> 02:50:55.518]  AstraZeneca and the cholesterol, the drug companies that make the cholesterol- Sure, they want to say it's the cholesterol that's bad, not imbalances in the body, and at the same time, they want to put statins in the water, even of children, so they're creating this world where the building blocks of our body are listed as evil, so they can tax them and regulate them and control them, not letting us have access to it.
[02:50:56.278 --> 02:51:02.462]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:51:02.462 --> 02:51:05.424]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:51:05.424 --> 02:51:10.828]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:51:10.828 --> 02:51:15.511]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[02:51:15.771 --> 02:51:23.418]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[02:51:23.418 --> 02:51:27.302]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[02:51:27.302 --> 02:51:29.084]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:51:29.084 --> 02:51:33.107]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[02:51:33.107 --> 02:51:35.730]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:51:35.990 --> 02:51:38.772]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[02:51:38.772 --> 02:51:43.335]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food costs.
[02:51:43.335 --> 02:51:43.996]  Don't wait!
[02:51:43.996 --> 02:51:46.437]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.

[02:51:56.243 --> 02:51:57.804]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[02:51:57.804 --> 02:52:03.910]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts, and more into the Bokashi!
[02:52:03.910 --> 02:52:12.098]  If you love to garden and compost, but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or the smell, then check out the E-M Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Terragonics.
[02:52:12.098 --> 02:52:17.763]  Finally, a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively and stop using fertilizers.

[02:52:20.265 --> 02:52:30.309]  Rather than decomposition, the Bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste, so it takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens, with no turning and no obnoxious odors.

[02:52:53.149 --> 02:52:54.112]  Terragonics.
[02:52:54.112 --> 02:52:54.793]  Life's getting better!
[02:52:56.107 --> 02:52:58.588]  The food storage industry leader has done it again.
[02:52:58.588 --> 02:53:02.869]  Introducing FDG Clubs and Survival Bucks from the Freeze-Dry Guy.
[02:53:02.869 --> 02:53:10.832]  For over 39 years, the Freeze-Dry Guy has served various government agencies and the private sector with the finest in storable foods and emergency rations.
[02:53:10.832 --> 02:53:15.013]  If you've wanted to build emergency food supplies but couldn't afford it, now you can.

[02:53:43.212 --> 02:53:45.174]  That's freezedryguy.com or call 866-404-3663.
[02:53:45.174 --> 02:53:46.075]  The Freeze Dry Guy.
[02:53:46.075 --> 02:53:46.815]  The best you can buy.
[02:54:05.136 --> 02:54:12.764]  No, they don't want us to know that they've produced artificial food designed to make us sick and mentally ill.
[02:54:12.764 --> 02:54:15.967]  They don't want you to know if you can't sleep, it's magnesium.
[02:54:15.967 --> 02:54:20.092]  They got a deadly class 3 narcotic for you.
[02:54:21.547 --> 02:54:27.410]  They don't want you to know you got rotholes in your skin because you don't have enough vitamin C. You got zits all over the place.
[02:54:27.410 --> 02:54:30.692]  They don't want you to know any of this stuff.
[02:54:30.692 --> 02:54:33.473]  By the way, Paul Watson's article is very powerful.
[02:54:33.473 --> 02:54:36.174]  It's up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanner.com.
[02:54:36.174 --> 02:54:42.478]  DHS classifies new ammo purchases following controversy as they buy even more than 1.4 billion.
[02:54:42.478 --> 02:54:47.520]  And all these different agencies are getting it.
[02:54:47.520 --> 02:54:48.641]  The post office, the
[02:54:50.825 --> 02:54:57.427]  Social Security Administration, the National Weather Association, and one of the commenters makes a point of a meaning to make.
[02:54:57.427 --> 02:55:01.349]  Google excluded income is their name.
[02:55:01.349 --> 02:55:04.530]  And it's fact, hollow point bullets are illegal to use in war.
[02:55:04.530 --> 02:55:05.750]  Yep.
[02:55:05.750 --> 02:55:08.751]  Hollow point bullets are too expensive for practice uses.
[02:55:08.751 --> 02:55:13.773]  Hollow points are for our heads and torso and arms and legs.
[02:55:13.773 --> 02:55:16.834]  Yeah, I mean, these are bullets for us, 1.4 billion bullets.
[02:55:20.077 --> 02:55:29.105]  Ben, I just had to ask you, because you're a smart guy, what is your take on armored pillboxes, checkpoints getting set up, and 1.4 plus million rounds of ammo for us?
[02:55:29.105 --> 02:55:31.568]  I mean, what are these criminal lunatics planning?
[02:55:31.568 --> 02:55:35.692]  Well, you know, it gets to what you were saying before we went to the break.
[02:55:35.692 --> 02:55:40.837]  We are at risk of losing our individual freedoms because we're not paying attention and we've
[02:55:41.577 --> 02:55:42.218]  We're good to go.
[02:55:57.509 --> 02:55:59.190]  But yeah, I mean, here's my frustration.
[02:55:59.190 --> 02:56:06.392]  I've seen it work with family, Aaron Dykes, I lost 40 pounds, and then just am not in the habit of taking stuff all day, so I quit doing it.
[02:56:06.392 --> 02:56:07.573]  Now I'm back on it.
[02:56:07.573 --> 02:56:12.815]  Even when I know it's real myself, I'm so weak I can't fully commit, Ben.
[02:56:13.991 --> 02:56:14.591]  Well, you know what?
[02:56:14.591 --> 02:56:23.955]  You can't fully commit until you do, because once you do, you would not want to... Once you do commit, you're not going to want to be without your Beyond Tangy Tangerine, your nutritional supplements.
[02:56:23.955 --> 02:56:28.537]  And it may be that... Well, no, I mean, I take them once or twice a day, but you're supposed to take them, you know, three, four times a day.
[02:56:28.537 --> 02:56:31.058]  My point is, I've already seen dramatic results.
[02:56:31.058 --> 02:56:34.940]  I just can't believe how real this is and how hidden in plain view.
[02:56:34.940 --> 02:56:36.981]  Like, drink more water, you know?
[02:56:36.981 --> 02:56:37.141]  Right.
[02:56:37.401 --> 02:56:38.182]  Oh, here's another one.
[02:56:38.182 --> 02:56:39.042]  Just breathing.
[02:56:39.042 --> 02:56:43.786]  One of the most powerful ways to lower your blood pressure is to practice diaphragmatic breathing.
[02:56:43.786 --> 02:56:51.332]  Simple oxygen can drop your blood pressure and get you off your antihypertensive drugs, your calcium channel blockers, and your beta blockers.
[02:56:51.332 --> 02:56:58.237]  And by the way, Alex, among the deadliest drugs of all, and there's a lot of deadly drugs, are these antihypertensive drugs.
[02:56:58.237 --> 02:57:06.023]  Now they want to give you the polypill, which is a combination of three or four antihypertensive drugs that you take in one pill.
[02:57:06.223 --> 02:57:07.844]  That's what I wanted to ask you next!
[02:57:07.844 --> 02:57:12.188]  And your body's doing all this hyper stuff to keep you alive, you block it, you end up killing yourself.
[02:57:12.188 --> 02:57:20.436]  What do you make of all the big pharma documents in like five companies the last month coming out where they know their drugs are killing us and have no benefit and are laughing at us?
[02:57:20.436 --> 02:57:21.677]  I mean, they're so evil!
[02:57:22.057 --> 02:57:24.319]  Have you heard about Propecia, the baldness drug now?
[02:57:24.319 --> 02:57:25.600]  Yes, tell us.
[02:57:25.600 --> 02:57:30.623]  Propecia is the baldness drug, and now people are surprised that Merck has been hiding the side effects.
[02:57:30.623 --> 02:57:33.986]  The company that makes Propecia has been hiding all the side effects that are associated with this.
[02:57:33.986 --> 02:57:41.351]  But the bottom line here is we shouldn't be surprised, because the mechanism of drugs is to block things in the body.
[02:57:41.351 --> 02:57:43.352]  That's why you have anti-hypertensive.
[02:57:43.352 --> 02:57:50.818]  Merck knew that the MMR shot was actually giving people the measles, mumps, and rubella, and they were like, ha ha ha!
[02:57:51.178 --> 02:57:54.500]  We'll get more money as we spread the measles, mumps, and rubella.
[02:57:54.500 --> 02:57:56.682]  I mean, it's just the diabolical nature.
[02:57:56.682 --> 02:57:57.662]  It is diabolical.
[02:57:57.662 --> 02:57:58.623]  That's exactly right.
[02:57:58.623 --> 02:58:00.424]  You're playing with the body's chemistry.
[02:58:00.424 --> 02:58:08.670]  If you're on a prescription drug, Alex, your number one health objective needs to be to figure out how to get off that prescription drug.
[02:58:08.670 --> 02:58:11.752]  If you're on a prescription drug, it's not a matter of losing weight.
[02:58:11.752 --> 02:58:13.413]  It's not a matter of going to the gym.
[02:58:13.413 --> 02:58:14.914]  It's not a matter of eating better.
[02:58:14.914 --> 02:58:18.897]  It's a matter of getting off that prescription drug because it's killing you.
[02:58:18.897 --> 02:58:21.098]  And nutritional supplementation is your best strategy.
[02:58:21.918 --> 02:58:24.059]  Yeah, again, because supplements work with the body.
[02:58:24.059 --> 02:58:25.179]  We're designed for those.
[02:58:25.179 --> 02:58:33.202]  Drugs go, like you said, Darth Vader, put a gun to your head, whereas the natural stuff just works with the body as a family.
[02:58:33.202 --> 02:58:34.102]  Symbiotic.
[02:58:34.102 --> 02:58:34.642]  Incredible.
