[00:20.880 --> 00:32.640]  well fresh off of Dave Mustaine on the show yesterday with his official
[00:32.640 --> 00:36.160]  international response to saying the mass shootings could have been staged by
[00:36.160 --> 00:41.520]  the criminals that staged pass and furious you know them as the Obama
[00:41.520 --> 00:47.800]  administration and then we had Richard Belzer along with Christopher Walken
[00:47.800 --> 00:53.440]  yesterday on the heels of that you can only go up one level to quote spinal
[00:53.440 --> 00:58.320]  tap from 10 to 11 I said well why don't just make it louder make it in as it's
[00:58.320 --> 01:04.600]  11 and our 11 is Max Kaiser alright max is a funny guy I like him you know he'd
[01:04.600 --> 01:09.360]  be a nice fun guy to hang around drink beer with but I shouldn't open the
[01:09.360 --> 01:11.640]  interview up joking around with him or that'll set the tone and then it'll
[01:11.640 --> 01:15.680]  disintegrate very rapidly with the two of us and I am in a kind of a joking
[01:15.680 --> 01:20.440]  mood today don't don't ask me why well actually I know why all work and no
[01:20.440 --> 01:24.760]  play makes Jack a dull boy actually got to go wakeboarding yesterday evening
[01:24.760 --> 01:30.120]  with some friends that took me out want to thank them for that and I feel
[01:30.120 --> 01:33.240]  energized I feel like I was on a week-long vacation now I have many
[01:33.240 --> 01:36.760]  vacations three-hour periods every once in a while so we're gonna be talking
[01:36.760 --> 01:43.320]  about the big news with Max Kaiser when we come back from break we're gonna get
[01:43.320 --> 01:47.640]  into the talk of QE 3 the rapidly deteriorating situations as we had him
[01:47.640 --> 01:53.360]  on a week ago less than a week ago doing nothing to MF global what precedent
[01:53.360 --> 01:59.600]  this sets we're talking about it all with Max Kaiser today and we're also gonna
[01:59.600 --> 02:02.760]  look at the bunch of the different military developments and more and the
[02:02.760 --> 02:07.000]  new combat robots to occupy our cities Pentagon developing autonomous
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.240]  humanoid robots to perform evacuation operations like Katrina that means gun
[02:11.240 --> 02:16.240]  confiscations so talk about Skynet it's here in police departments are getting
[02:16.240 --> 02:21.280]  Homeland Security blimps it's all very nice so it's all part of well it's all
[02:21.280 --> 02:26.520]  part of our tax money and the playing army on the disheveled overtaxed American
[02:26.520 --> 02:30.800]  people but it's the same thing worldwide happening Max Kaiser tell us tell us
[02:30.800 --> 02:33.400]  what's front and center on your plate and we're gonna come back and launch the
[02:33.400 --> 02:38.040]  official interview here Max Kaiser syndicated radio host TV host Max
[02:38.040 --> 02:44.120]  Kaiser dot com a one-stop shop for all things financial crystal ball gazing
[02:44.120 --> 02:49.080]  good to have you here with us yeah it's a great great to be with you and just
[02:49.080 --> 02:53.040]  continuing on the theme that we established a few months ago just
[02:53.040 --> 02:58.920]  trying to pick the exact date of when you have this global fiat money
[02:58.920 --> 03:03.160]  collapse I've said April next year is the outside chance of that happening
[03:03.160 --> 03:08.600]  anytime between now and then and just try to figure out where the seismic
[03:08.600 --> 03:13.600]  shocks are in the system what'll what'll trigger the event so I'm looking at a
[03:13.600 --> 03:17.960]  couple of different things and as I mentioned on the last show I've done
[03:17.960 --> 03:23.960]  some more work looking into Japan you know Japan is a very interesting
[03:23.960 --> 03:29.440]  country because they funded 20 years of stagnant economic development with their
[03:29.440 --> 03:36.320]  savings account so people in Japan are almost forced to buy Japanese government
[03:36.320 --> 03:40.120]  bonds but now demographically these people are retiring so they have to
[03:40.120 --> 03:46.160]  sell to fund their retirement so that means a guarantee upward movement
[03:46.160 --> 03:52.840]  interest rates that could be the trigger that starts a global cascading effect in
[03:52.840 --> 03:57.480]  the entire what got me started on this is because it just emerged this past week
[03:57.480 --> 04:02.240]  Alex at the big the second biggest buyer of US Treasury debt now is no longer
[04:02.240 --> 04:06.040]  China number one of course is America America is the biggest buyer of its own
[04:06.040 --> 04:11.880]  debt but taking the second spot now is Japan China is walking away from the
[04:11.880 --> 04:16.440]  table Japan has always been under the Treasury of America's thumb they'll do
[04:16.440 --> 04:20.400]  whatever America says and now they are the number two biggest buyer of US
[04:20.400 --> 04:24.200]  Treasury bonds but that is extremely dangerous because their economy itself is
[04:24.200 --> 04:27.800]  a tinderbox probably the weakest most fragile economy in the world but after
[04:27.800 --> 04:31.160]  the Fukushima disaster after 20 years of the zombie economy and the zombie
[04:31.160 --> 04:35.360]  banks but now they are supporting America Japan the zombie economy is
[04:35.360 --> 04:39.120]  supporting the American economy and give you an idea of how fragile the system
[04:39.120 --> 04:43.480]  is China is walking away what is China buying with the money that they have
[04:43.480 --> 04:48.520]  well it's turned out that they are buying gold my sources tell me that China
[04:48.520 --> 04:52.160]  before the end of this year will come out with an official statement and now
[04:52.160 --> 04:56.280]  saying that they've upped their gold by over a thousand tons stay there stay
[04:56.280 --> 05:00.760]  there we're gonna come right back with all things economic the worst drought in
[05:00.760 --> 05:04.680]  50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half
[05:04.680 --> 05:09.480]  year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only
[05:09.480 --> 05:13.680]  corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising
[05:13.680 --> 05:17.480]  prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of
[05:17.480 --> 05:21.520]  business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to counter this is to
[05:21.520 --> 05:25.760]  freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from
[05:25.760 --> 05:29.800]  eat foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases eat foods will
[05:29.800 --> 05:33.600]  have to raise prices to now is the time to get your supply I recently increased
[05:33.600 --> 05:36.880]  my supply from eat foods direct because we have all known this was coming you
[05:36.880 --> 05:40.760]  know about their delicious long-term storable foods the fact is you can eat
[05:40.760 --> 05:44.360]  it anytime to save money today and because it stores for 25 years they're
[05:44.360 --> 05:47.840]  locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost don't wait call

[08:46.400 --> 08:53.400]  king of rats the washington examiner drudgereport.com are reporting drudge
[08:53.400 --> 08:59.080]  is linked to it as technically he's not reporting that she is a set to not be his
[08:59.080 --> 09:03.800]  VP because they want to get rid of biden I mean that's that's admitted after
[09:03.800 --> 09:09.080]  biden came out and so they want to put basically chains on black people
[09:09.080 --> 09:15.840]  hillary rejected VP slot you ready your own 2016 run and go ahead and go to the
[09:15.840 --> 09:19.040]  examiner you know let's show people if they're watching on prison planet on TV
[09:19.040 --> 09:24.520]  and it goes on secretary of state hillary clinton was pressed by her husband
[09:24.520 --> 09:29.440]  and a top obama aide to consider replacing vice president joe biden just
[09:29.440 --> 09:33.680]  a couple of weeks ago claims the author of the new york times bestseller the
[09:33.680 --> 09:38.520]  amateur and they're going over it looks like a pretty good source but who knows
[09:38.520 --> 09:44.520]  continuing here following biden's footsteps MSNBC host says romney
[09:44.520 --> 09:51.560]  engaging in inward adnization he actually said it I'm not gonna go the the
[09:51.560 --> 09:55.280]  route of their talk show hosts saying it's saying it's not that big of a deal
[09:55.280 --> 09:59.480]  they use it as a weapon let's use the word doesn't matter with the political
[09:59.480 --> 10:03.040]  correctness they can say that stuff to get everybody fighting with each other
[10:03.040 --> 10:07.840]  and to inject racial division divide and conquer and then it's cute and sweet
[10:07.840 --> 10:15.120]  yeah you can show the cruiser can we even show the headline oh he's allowed
[10:15.120 --> 10:23.200]  to say it to try to create race war but then we the evil whitey exactly we're
[10:23.200 --> 10:26.720]  we're bad and again it isn't a black white thing these people know this
[10:26.720 --> 10:31.640]  they're engaging in class warfare they're just literally pimping out racial
[10:31.640 --> 10:36.840]  conflict it's it's unbelievable those black leaders make sure those black
[10:36.840 --> 10:42.000]  babies get aborted 51% of them so we're gonna be going over all of that but
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.320]  that's enough coming up in about 25 minutes we're gonna open the phones up
[10:45.320 --> 10:52.040]  vector open now for your questions for former top stockbroker retired author
[10:52.040 --> 10:57.200]  researcher we've done BBC shows syndicated radio RT press TV does that
[10:57.200 --> 11:02.120]  every week max keiser was on with us Friday no no last Sunday now he's on
[11:02.120 --> 11:09.080]  with us this Friday it is the 17th day of August 2012 on this Friday edition
[11:09.080 --> 11:14.920]  this is teleprompter free radio slash TV talking point free as well we just
[11:14.920 --> 11:17.960]  cover it well like I see it my guest see it that's why sometimes we have
[11:17.960 --> 11:21.520]  differing views with guests we're not monolithic liberal show monolithic
[11:21.520 --> 11:24.960]  conservative show I'm into freedom I'm into an open debate I'm into getting
[11:24.960 --> 11:28.560]  people to think for themselves I think you deserve more than talking points I
[11:28.560 --> 11:31.800]  think you're smart I think when I tell you all this scary stuff you'll make
[11:31.800 --> 11:35.720]  preparation for it I don't tell you this stuff to scare you I think you're like
[11:35.720 --> 11:40.320]  me I think you want to know the truth the truth's always there anyways if you
[11:40.320 --> 11:44.040]  if you didn't know the elevator didn't actually come when the door is open you
[11:44.040 --> 11:48.560]  step out and go well I don't see an elevator I see a hundred floor shaft but
[11:48.560 --> 11:52.760]  you know I just feel like I'll step on in there I'm gonna be positive I don't
[11:52.760 --> 11:56.480]  want to be scared and then you'd fall 100 floors and die and you'll bounce at
[11:56.480 --> 12:00.800]  the bottom and splat everywhere like sloppy joes on the highway that's what
[12:00.800 --> 12:04.040]  we're talking about here okay the elevator doors have opened there is no
[12:04.040 --> 12:08.520]  elevator do not walk into it but people are like lemmings falling off the edge
[12:08.520 --> 12:13.680]  of the cliff after all Gloria Steinem says it's cool I mean she is CIA after
[12:13.680 --> 12:18.720]  all which means banker banker occupier max keiser of max keiser.com joins us
[12:18.720 --> 12:22.080]  he's also the inventor of the virtual trading system he's with a Hollywood
[12:22.080 --> 12:26.680]  stock exchange he was on with us Sunday and now things have really deteriorated
[12:26.680 --> 12:31.720]  Fox News AP Reuters they're all talking about global collapse banks prepared for
[12:31.720 --> 12:38.480]  collapse banks told prepare for collapse we've been now told and China has
[12:38.480 --> 12:41.600]  announced the government's pulling out of the US stock market saying it's
[12:41.600 --> 12:47.000]  fraudulent that's what max has been saying George Soros and others rushing
[12:47.000 --> 12:51.840]  in to buy gold getting completely out of the market even privately they stopped
[12:51.840 --> 12:57.280]  managing people's money years ago what does all of this signify for those of us
[12:57.280 --> 13:03.320]  watching the writings on the wall massive war total collapse is it of can it be
[13:03.320 --> 13:10.400]  averted or max when you say collapse on the outside by next April at the latest
[13:10.400 --> 13:14.280]  are you saying that it will happen is there any way to averted what does the
[13:14.280 --> 13:19.200]  collapse look like max keiser you have the floor yeah I'm saying that it's a
[13:19.200 --> 13:24.840]  90% chance of collapse by next April and that but it could happen at any time
[13:24.840 --> 13:30.560]  between now and April the global economy you have to look at in terms of the way
[13:30.560 --> 13:34.400]  a systems analyst would look at any complicated system every time you add
[13:34.400 --> 13:40.560]  more to the system the complexity doesn't rise in a linear fashion it rises
[13:40.560 --> 13:45.680]  exponentially so every time the Fed puts on more quantitative easing every time
[13:45.680 --> 13:49.400]  investment banks bail out some other investment bank every time more
[13:49.400 --> 13:54.200]  derivatives are released into the system you don't go from let's say 700
[13:54.200 --> 13:58.600]  trillion in notional value derivatives to 800 trillion in a linear way you have
[13:58.600 --> 14:02.800]  to think about in terms of this global quadrillion to two quadrillion
[14:02.800 --> 14:11.200]  derivative souffle being encumbered with exponentially more risk this is classic
[14:11.200 --> 14:15.200]  systems analysis because we no longer have an economy of supply and demand of
[14:15.200 --> 14:19.760]  output of factories of wages we've left that world 40 years ago when we went
[14:19.760 --> 14:23.960]  off the gold standard 1971 by the way this is the 41st anniversary of the
[14:23.960 --> 14:28.920]  closing of the gold window on August 15th 1971 by Richard Nixon but all this
[14:28.920 --> 14:32.120]  time since then we've been building in the complexity building in the debt and
[14:32.120 --> 14:36.960]  so now between now in April next year as my call you're gonna have complete
[14:36.960 --> 14:43.440]  systemic collapse much worse than a 2008 2008 was just a precursor to what
[14:43.440 --> 14:48.920]  will be a complete not a breakdown and just so the game here is to try to pick
[14:48.920 --> 14:56.520]  where it starts what's the trigger and to kind of study it in terms of how the
[14:56.520 --> 15:00.840]  economy's rattle and roll as a result of this complete and not our systemic
[15:00.840 --> 15:05.600]  breakdown as I mentioned Japan to me seems like the weakest link in the chain
[15:05.600 --> 15:10.320]  once that goes it's the one of the top three armies in the world the second
[15:10.320 --> 15:14.360]  biggest creditor behind the u.s. itself the u.s. debt and they just have a lot
[15:14.360 --> 15:19.760]  of awful demographic and economic trends going against them so it looks more
[15:19.760 --> 15:23.600]  locally out to follow up on a story you've been talking about for a few
[15:23.600 --> 15:28.960]  weeks the fraud that is Facebook Groupon and Zynga I want to add something you
[15:28.960 --> 15:34.040]  said on this show let me just interrupt to give the number out 800-259-9231
[15:34.040 --> 15:39.640]  800-259-9231 calls coming up at the bottom of the hour max I hate to toot
[15:39.640 --> 15:43.240]  your horn I just want to point out mainstream media gets it wrong most the
[15:43.240 --> 15:46.960]  time beforehand because they're lying they have an agenda you keep getting it
[15:46.960 --> 15:51.080]  right and our guests do because it's you know what's happening but expanding on
[15:51.080 --> 15:56.320]  this you said six months ago well before this you said Facebook was going to be a
[15:56.320 --> 16:00.480]  giant pump and dump everybody who knew what was going on knew that and now they
[16:00.480 --> 16:05.360]  get away with this but Martha Stewart goes to jail go ahead right it's a pump
[16:05.360 --> 16:11.840]  dump scandal and which is what you would see on Wall Street 20 years ago on the
[16:11.840 --> 16:16.840]  penny stock firms you know they're very famous companies back then who were big
[16:16.840 --> 16:19.920]  in the penny stock and they would call people up on the phone and get them to
[16:19.920 --> 16:23.640]  buy stock while they themselves were selling the stock and then suddenly
[16:23.640 --> 16:27.280]  there were no more sellers in the stock would collapse and the insiders made out
[16:27.280 --> 16:31.000]  like bandits now this is the first time we've seen it operated on this huge
[16:31.000 --> 16:35.760]  scale Facebook was a hundred and four billion dollar public offering Barack
[16:35.760 --> 16:38.400]  Obama had his arm around Mark Zuckerberg he was involved in this pump and dump
[16:38.400 --> 16:45.160]  they go public at 104 billion and they are now down 50% from the IPO price 60
[16:45.160 --> 16:48.840]  or 70% from the high just touched after the IPO price and you've got two other
[16:48.840 --> 16:53.960]  stocks I want to talk about Zynga and Groupon Groupon is a stock that won
[16:53.960 --> 17:00.040]  public at 20 traded near 30 is now at five and Zynga is down 60 or 70 80% as
[17:00.040 --> 17:03.480]  well what all these three companies have in common this is a dimension that
[17:03.480 --> 17:06.840]  hasn't been touched on a lot is that they all share a common auditor
[17:06.840 --> 17:11.240]  Ernst and Young Ernst and Young is one of the biggest auditors in America they
[17:11.240 --> 17:14.560]  are crooked they are as crooked as Wall Street there is crooked as the fund
[17:14.560 --> 17:18.360]  managers they are as crooked as the rating agencies there is crooked at
[17:18.360 --> 17:22.040]  explain how this works it's not just that they're crooked and cook the books
[17:22.040 --> 17:25.840]  only certain groups like Arthur Anderson and others who are politically
[17:25.840 --> 17:31.160]  connected with Justice Department people in a revolving door only you go to them
[17:31.160 --> 17:35.000]  not for them to cook the books even really that's on the surface it's
[17:35.000 --> 17:40.480]  really a payoff to regulators who are in a revolving door to let you be above
[17:40.480 --> 17:45.240]  the law well Arthur Anderson is one of the biggest accounting firms they got
[17:45.240 --> 17:51.160]  caught but Enron Enron blew up and Arthur Anderson disappeared there were ten
[17:51.160 --> 17:54.480]  or so big firms at one point I think we're down to four but am I correct in
[17:54.480 --> 18:03.360]  one I said Ernst and Young is not necessarily hired to cook the books
[18:03.360 --> 18:11.480]  because the system is so corrupt that there is no genuine generally
[18:11.480 --> 18:15.360]  accounting accepted accounting principles worth anything anymore
[18:15.360 --> 18:19.760]  Ernst and Young they cover these three companies that I just mentioned they
[18:19.760 --> 18:23.600]  have just lost in total these three companies alone the market caps have
[18:23.600 --> 18:28.560]  dropped by 62 billion dollars in the past just few months and it's going
[18:28.560 --> 18:31.760]  public and just to give you an idea what Ernst and Young does or these big
[18:31.760 --> 18:35.640]  accounting firms do I hadn't experienced myself when I was CEO of a company in
[18:35.640 --> 18:38.720]  Los Angeles we had one of these big accounting firms come in price Waterhouse
[18:38.720 --> 18:42.960]  Cooper and they what the trick is basically they they what it depends on
[18:42.960 --> 18:49.240]  what they call revenue in the case of Zynga that they sell virtual tractors
[18:49.240 --> 18:54.160]  and they and they sell virtual raspberries as part of Farmville which is a
[18:54.160 --> 18:58.000]  game on Facebook the Ernst and Young would count the virtual money as real
[18:58.000 --> 19:01.280]  money so that was the fraud that they were committing in the case of the
[19:01.280 --> 19:04.440]  company I was involved with price Waterhouse Cooper they were
[19:04.440 --> 19:10.080]  identifying losses as revenue we had two million dollars in losses they put in
[19:10.080 --> 19:14.280]  the filing for the IPO appears turns two million in revenues according to their
[19:14.280 --> 19:19.080]  formula that was revenues of the company even though they were the losses of the
[19:19.080 --> 19:22.440]  company but they didn't get in trouble for after that because the accounting
[19:22.440 --> 19:25.200]  rules in America just like all the banking rules and all the political
[19:25.200 --> 19:28.400]  rules and all the special interest rules and all the abrogation of all the
[19:28.400 --> 19:31.440]  civil rights and all the constitutional rules are now in the hands of the
[19:31.440 --> 19:35.640]  lunatics running this asylum they're the ones Ernst and Young can say that losses
[19:35.640 --> 19:39.800]  equal revenues and therefore the company is worth a hundred billion dollars then
[19:39.800 --> 19:42.880]  it goes to the public market and within three months we know wait a minute
[19:42.880 --> 19:46.360]  sure companies are worth five dollars sure max stay there we come back I want
[19:46.360 --> 19:50.600]  to I want to get your take on this then if the whole thing is rotten as you said
[19:50.600 --> 19:54.400]  that the whole structure is the rust take the rust out of the car there's no car
[19:54.400 --> 20:00.320]  what happens when there is an implosion is it total does it make it worse the
[20:00.320 --> 20:04.360]  worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the
[20:04.360 --> 20:08.560]  hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought
[20:08.560 --> 20:12.840]  conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all
[20:12.840 --> 20:17.440]  impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers
[20:17.440 --> 20:21.200]  out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to counter this
[20:21.200 --> 20:25.320]  is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of
[20:25.320 --> 20:29.520]  foods for me foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases eat

[23:37.880 --> 23:41.320]  this capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[23:41.320 --> 23:44.200]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a
[23:44.200 --> 23:47.360]  standing army hi Ted Anderson I'm placing a silver dollar in a book
[23:47.360 --> 23:52.840]  explains our monetary system call for your copy 800 686 2237 it's time to
[23:52.840 --> 24:00.480]  understand the system call 800 686 2237 that's 800 686 to 2237
[24:00.480 --> 24:27.120]  oh the foreign bankers at a bad bad thing oh they did and now they're buying
[24:27.120 --> 24:32.760]  1.4 billion bullets they've got drones and checkpoints going up everywhere and
[24:32.760 --> 24:38.120]  more and more they admit it's for a civil unrest collapse max Kaiser he's been
[24:38.120 --> 24:43.200]  stunningly accurate in his prediction so far unfortunately is saying in the
[24:43.200 --> 24:49.500]  next I don't know how far away is April three four five six seven months six
[24:49.500 --> 24:55.240]  seven months he sees it all imploding and now they're in Fox News saying it
[24:55.240 --> 24:58.880]  looks like the Fed is going to go to QE3 but they've already done other forms of
[24:58.880 --> 25:03.440]  stimulus that cause inflation max what happens when the corruption is so
[25:03.440 --> 25:10.200]  systemic I mean if we had crashes in the in 1929 not much of the economy was
[25:10.200 --> 25:15.040]  tied up in the market what happens when everything's tied up in fraud if things
[25:15.040 --> 25:20.280]  go belly up well it's a good point because back in the 20s and 30s you
[25:20.280 --> 25:24.320]  still had a very big farming component in the US economy and even during the
[25:24.320 --> 25:28.280]  Depression there was enough family farms in America people could eat to some
[25:28.280 --> 25:33.040]  degree that's so many more you have the big industrial farming the Monsanto and
[25:33.040 --> 25:36.520]  farming the huge conglomerate farming you don't really have the small farms
[25:36.520 --> 25:40.280]  anymore so when the thing blows up there's no recourse there's nowhere to
[25:40.280 --> 25:44.560]  go back I'll make another prediction for 2013 you keep asking me is there any way
[25:44.560 --> 25:49.160]  to stop it I say no there's no way to stop this because systems analysis is
[25:49.160 --> 25:53.480]  you know tells me that when you complicate a system to the degree that
[25:53.480 --> 25:57.640]  this has been compromised and complicated there is a 99.9 percent
[25:57.640 --> 26:02.840]  probability of a total utter systemic collapse before April and that's my
[26:02.840 --> 26:07.800]  thought now following up on that there is only one possible outcome as a
[26:07.800 --> 26:11.640]  result of that in that civil war there's got to be a civil war it's gonna be a
[26:11.640 --> 26:17.160]  civil war in America intergenerational all the people under 30 are gonna go to
[26:17.160 --> 26:22.360]  war with everybody who's 45 plus who basically stole all their money stole
[26:22.360 --> 26:27.280]  their country stole their wealth destroyed the the air ability and the
[26:27.280 --> 26:32.560]  viability of the of the soil and that will be the civil war there's only if
[26:32.560 --> 26:38.720]  you have one you're gonna have the other and that would come in 2013
[26:38.720 --> 26:44.280]  I'm so speechless I've got to interject something here that this is shaking me
[26:44.280 --> 26:48.040]  right now because I know you wouldn't just say this and put your credibility on
[26:48.040 --> 26:53.400]  the line you're really sure of this and I I hope you're wrong that's all I can
[26:53.400 --> 26:58.880]  say well I'm putting my flag you know planning my flag on this one as I have
[26:58.880 --> 27:04.640]  done before with predictions previously and there's because it there's there's
[27:04.640 --> 27:08.680]  no avoiding the collapse there's no there's no remedy to the collapse and
[27:08.680 --> 27:16.200]  the the the underlying chaos is too is too great the 86 percent of all the
[27:16.200 --> 27:19.720]  trades in the New York Stock Exchange are computer to computer that's true of
[27:19.720 --> 27:23.040]  exchanges all over the world the algorithms that support all this
[27:23.040 --> 27:26.640]  trading are funded with zero percent interest rates from the Fed they can
[27:26.640 --> 27:30.920]  borrow money at zero they can do anything they want with any amount of money
[27:30.920 --> 27:34.240]  that they want and they ever make a mistake to get bailed out with more
[27:34.240 --> 27:38.280]  free money from the feds and they keep adding layer and layer and layer of
[27:38.280 --> 27:43.320]  problems on the system we already had the flash crash in 2010 we had the
[27:43.320 --> 27:48.360]  entire evisceration of night capital just a couple weeks ago 440 million in 45
[27:48.360 --> 27:53.200]  minutes due to a spastic computer program here's why you may be right I mean
[27:53.200 --> 27:58.240]  undoubtedly it's all a giant fraud waiting to blow up max but why why are
[27:58.240 --> 28:02.360]  the Chinese pulling out of the US stock market they're buying gold they're buying
[28:02.360 --> 28:05.360]  every that this is going to be another surprise announcement now they're
[28:05.360 --> 28:09.840]  gonna come out before the end of the year and say that their gold holdings are
[28:09.840 --> 28:13.600]  not at roughly a thousand tons but they're closer to 2,000 tons they may
[28:13.600 --> 28:17.840]  even be up toward 3,000 tons which would put them right up with Germany number
[28:17.840 --> 28:22.640]  two biggest concentration of gold in the world is Germany with 3,000 tons then the
[28:22.640 --> 28:27.520]  US with 8,000 tons China big surprise announcement coming this year they're
[28:27.520 --> 28:32.760]  either gonna double probably double their gold to 2,000 tons it'll shock the
[28:32.760 --> 28:38.440]  world it'll put a whole nother wave of buying pressure on gold which we still
[28:38.440 --> 28:43.120]  see is going to continue it's it's climbed to five six seven thousand
[28:43.120 --> 28:47.440]  dollars an ounce and China is a big part of that use as you mentioned Soros is
[28:47.440 --> 28:52.160]  now back in gold in a big way John Paulson one of the biggest hedge fund
[28:52.160 --> 28:56.160]  managers the world is now 44% of his fund is entirely in gold bullion that's
[28:56.160 --> 29:00.520]  billions of dollars the hedge funds the smart money is always the first mover
[29:00.520 --> 29:04.280]  and they get in there first they know what's coming they see the collapse a
[29:04.280 --> 29:06.880]  lot of other hedge funds are closing business because the system is too
[29:06.880 --> 29:10.560]  chaotic there's two treacherous out there funds are just pulling the plug well
[29:10.560 --> 29:15.520]  yeah well I mean that's what the Chinese said they they said Monday I mean
[29:15.520 --> 29:19.200]  of course you just mentioned earlier they said this system doesn't work it's
[29:19.200 --> 29:22.480]  not real in fact I had the article I forget their exact statement but they
[29:22.480 --> 29:26.160]  did that we'll try to find it during the break but they were like you know you
[29:26.160 --> 29:29.800]  know this system is no longer we can't gauge this they basically said it wasn't
[29:29.800 --> 29:37.480]  real exactly what you're saying Max yeah I know they listen to my show they
[29:37.480 --> 29:40.160]  listen to reality I'm sure and they probably do listen to you well they're
[29:40.160 --> 29:43.880]  right back with Max Kaiser and your phone calls and he's got a lot more to
[29:43.880 --> 29:54.320]  cover stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and

[31:09.880 --> 31:13.360]  more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even
[31:13.360 --> 31:16.600]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen

[33:12.640 --> 33:17.480]  time I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by
[33:17.480 --> 33:22.640]  burning pages you're a bug mr. Wordsworth a crawling insect an ugly
[33:22.640 --> 33:27.400]  misforn little creature who has no purpose here no meaning I am a human
[33:27.400 --> 33:34.800]  being words mr. Wordsworth they have no substance and no dimension like air like
[33:34.800 --> 33:41.520]  a wind I don't care I tell you I don't care I'm a human being I exist if I
[33:41.520 --> 33:47.200]  speak one for a loud that thought lives even after I'm shoveled in my grave
[33:47.200 --> 33:55.120]  delusions mr. Wordsworth delusions that you inject in the obeys to make you think you
[33:55.120 --> 33:58.920]  have a strength when you have no strength at all you have nothing but
[33:58.920 --> 34:06.200]  spindly limbs in a dream and the state has no use for your time resistance to
[34:06.200 --> 34:13.040]  tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[34:13.560 --> 34:17.880]  all right we're going back to Max Kaiser because I want to ask him what the
[34:17.880 --> 34:22.560]  collapse he's predicting will look like I mean he's saying worse than 08 and that
[34:22.560 --> 34:27.600]  was a heart attack in the financial system orchestrated to hold his hostage
[34:27.600 --> 34:33.000]  and bring in control how bad will this one be because Paulson the secretary of
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.920]  the Treasury threatened martial law and we first reported that for the
[34:35.920 --> 34:39.080]  congressman on the show who heard it in closed committee and people thought I
[34:39.080 --> 34:42.800]  made it up and a week later it was big national news we got no credit of course
[34:42.800 --> 34:46.480]  and it's not that that even matters I'm just tired of people doubting it when I
[34:46.480 --> 34:51.520]  have a congressman on or you know I have somebody interesting on them and if
[34:51.520 --> 34:56.160]  people just can't believe it was even real and it had like Willie Nelson on
[34:56.160 --> 34:59.360]  and I've seen people don't believe that Christopher walking on yesterday I mean
[34:59.360 --> 35:03.560]  they just they don't believe that the truth has been successful they just can't
[35:03.560 --> 35:07.640]  get it through their heads they're they're playing games with themselves not
[35:07.640 --> 35:11.440]  us that are awake we're gonna go back and ask him that question a moment and go

[37:14.560 --> 37:19.560]  Max Kaiser what what then does it collapse look like I mean you're
[37:19.560 --> 37:23.160]  you're going out there big time and I find it chilling because I respect your
[37:23.160 --> 37:28.240]  analysis when you say collapse some people then say that means road warrior
[37:28.240 --> 37:32.040]  you know bands of motorcycles feeding on people well crime rates are already
[37:32.040 --> 37:35.960]  exploding there are a lot of towns where there are no police or if there are
[37:35.960 --> 37:40.240]  there make sure you don't have guns or they are the gangs so we're starting to
[37:40.240 --> 37:44.880]  see some road one Chicago most dangerous thing in the world now but but obviously
[37:44.880 --> 37:49.680]  you're by collapse you don't mean full road warrior collapse or how bad could
[37:49.680 --> 37:55.960]  it get first of all before I get into that I wanted to touch on some news here
[37:55.960 --> 38:01.560]  about the extent to which this fraud has perpetrated itself throughout the
[38:01.560 --> 38:08.000]  economy and why people are going to continue to be outraged and why that
[38:08.000 --> 38:12.680]  anger is building remember John Corzine former head of Golden Sacks former
[38:12.680 --> 38:17.560]  governor of New Jersey he was caught when he moved over to MF global stealing
[38:17.560 --> 38:23.440]  $1.2 billion we talked about on your show before now he is basically allowed
[38:23.440 --> 38:29.560]  to go scot-free there's no penalty at all for John Corzine his defense his
[38:29.560 --> 38:36.040]  defense is that the money vaporized he has no idea where it went and he just
[38:36.040 --> 38:41.240]  can't seem to be able to generate any evidence of its whereabouts that are
[38:41.240 --> 38:46.000]  ever existed or where it went that's the kind of outrageous statement coming
[38:46.000 --> 38:49.560]  from a former governor former head of Goldman Sachs former head of MF global
[38:49.560 --> 38:54.840]  that gets into under people's skin and they say wait a minute this guy is part
[38:54.840 --> 39:00.640]  of a racket the racket of the rating agencies the fund managers Wall Street
[39:00.640 --> 39:05.320]  the auditors as we just talked about the media CNBC and it's a mafia style
[39:05.320 --> 39:11.280]  racket they're practicing racket tearing and they are stealing wholesale our
[39:11.280 --> 39:17.960]  wealth and by proxy our country at some point there is a breaking point and the
[39:17.960 --> 39:24.040]  most victimized group in America will be the new generation that wakes up one
[39:24.040 --> 39:31.160]  day and finds gasoline at $15 a gallon a bag of groceries for $300 and no way to
[39:31.160 --> 39:37.480]  get to work because the roads are completely in disrepair and on and on
[39:37.480 --> 39:43.080]  and on and those people will have no recourse whatsoever but to take back
[39:43.080 --> 39:47.600]  their country by any means necessary it's just it's not a big leap of faith
[39:47.600 --> 39:52.600]  here this is just a logical progression and the bankers are gearing up with 1.4
[39:52.600 --> 39:57.560]  billion plus rounds of ammo checkpoints giant armored tanks vehicles admitting
[39:57.560 --> 40:00.520]  they're gonna put the army on the street what's the army gonna do when
[40:00.520 --> 40:04.600]  their wife can't you know whether paycheck pay for groceries or mama's
[40:04.600 --> 40:08.960]  thrown out on the street I mean what are these bankers thinking well you know
[40:08.960 --> 40:13.840]  when you say it will be like road road warriors you know it could be like you
[40:13.840 --> 40:18.760]  know a soft gulag a soft gulag and what I mean by that would be on one hand
[40:18.760 --> 40:23.240]  you've got this massive private prison industry that's growing the fastest one
[40:23.240 --> 40:26.400]  of the fastest growing industry in America's private prisons corrections
[40:26.400 --> 40:29.080]  Corps of America hitting new all-time highs on their stock we talked about a
[40:29.080 --> 40:33.000]  real put all the people in the new FEMA camps where they're there for petty
[40:33.000 --> 40:37.720]  reasons making things further driving down wages all right that's well and
[40:37.720 --> 40:42.840]  and labor since we talked last last time has come out that factory owners in
[40:42.840 --> 40:46.720]  America are complaining to the Chamber of Commerce because the the prison labor
[40:46.720 --> 40:51.880]  now which works for 80 and 90 cents a day is becoming such a big component of
[40:51.880 --> 40:57.240]  the American labor force that the only way you can get a job in America now is
[40:57.240 --> 41:01.160]  to find it's a go to prison to find yourself in prison and it's so that the
[41:01.160 --> 41:05.840]  manufacturers the factories in America they don't have anybody to hire because
[41:05.840 --> 41:11.040]  the people in the crime wave in in France the riots the crime wave in Greece
[41:11.040 --> 41:15.520]  and they've disarmed most the people so the criminals are just robbing and it
[41:15.520 --> 41:18.840]  says the police can't help yeah because it turns out the cops are the ones
[41:18.840 --> 41:22.920]  robbing a lot of people I mean this is this is I mean this is this can only go
[41:22.920 --> 41:27.960]  on so long all right so that my idea the soft gulag is you first of all you have
[41:27.960 --> 41:31.360]  the hard gulag which are the prisons and the you know the camps and we know we
[41:31.360 --> 41:34.000]  see that being telegraphed in the stock market already because the
[41:34.000 --> 41:38.280]  capitalization of those companies is moving aggressively higher because they
[41:38.280 --> 41:42.480]  know that they're about to get 20 30 40 50 million new inmates and that's
[41:42.480 --> 41:47.000]  incredibly profitable they get huge tax abatements they get they own the
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.760]  restaurants and hotels near the prisons so people go visit their family in
[41:50.760 --> 41:54.160]  prison they eat in the restaurants they stay in the hotels you lose your voting
[41:54.160 --> 41:58.200]  rights it's a fantastic money center but the soft gulag we saw that last week
[41:58.200 --> 42:03.360]  with the introduction of face deals you know these new Facebook cameras in
[42:03.360 --> 42:08.760]  retail shops that are geared to face recognition you get discounts by giving
[42:08.760 --> 42:12.760]  up your liberties and freedoms and run but that's only up front later everyone
[42:12.760 --> 42:16.880]  will have to do it to buy and sell right so you in other words you give up your
[42:16.880 --> 42:21.480]  liberties and freedoms for a deal on some Chinese made garbage so you get 20
[42:21.480 --> 42:27.680]  cents off and you'll still you'll allow Facebook to essentially keep you in
[42:27.680 --> 42:32.480]  check keep you in line whenever you go into a mall or a shopping environment and
[42:32.480 --> 42:35.240]  of course I'll hook it up to the grid which includes every camera out there
[42:35.240 --> 42:41.000]  you will be buzzed on your cell phone whenever you stray off the path if you
[42:41.000 --> 42:44.800]  stray toward a retailing outlet that they don't want you to go to or doesn't
[42:44.800 --> 42:48.360]  have a deal that they want you to look at you'll get buzzed you'll get phone
[42:48.360 --> 42:52.040]  you'll start yeah this is how they control markets we've got to go to
[42:52.040 --> 42:56.200]  calls because I promised to but new documents big sis lied about canceling
[42:56.200 --> 43:00.400]  mobile body scanner program they're now rolling out giant they have the army
[43:00.400 --> 43:05.320]  doing this that we have footage on local news from New York where they make you
[43:05.320 --> 43:10.080]  and your family drive under a high-powered x-ray machine that shoots
[43:10.080 --> 43:15.920]  through metal more powerful than a chest x-ray and they're still rolling it out
[43:15.920 --> 43:19.920]  new documents big sis lied about canceling mobile body scanner program
[43:19.920 --> 43:24.080]  homeland security claimed it had dropped the plans in early stage we've got the
[43:24.080 --> 43:30.240]  local newscast showing the idiot police and military standing out there under
[43:30.240 --> 43:34.680]  high-powered I show people this article it's incredible under giant high-powered
[43:34.680 --> 43:39.440]  x-ray machines that shoot through your car and your or your truck I mean this is
[43:39.440 --> 43:43.960]  suicide I mean these globalists are just setting up a system of total war
[43:43.960 --> 43:49.720]  against everybody with the GMO food the radiation the mass death we we are run
[43:49.720 --> 43:56.200]  by lunatics gulag concept is coming into focus and Facebook by the way also was
[43:56.200 --> 44:01.080]  introducing online gambling in the UK with British pounds so that member I
[44:01.080 --> 44:04.760]  called the gulag casino which is going to people will give up their liberties
[44:04.760 --> 44:08.000]  also for a chance to gamble online of course they hold out these enormous
[44:08.000 --> 44:14.360]  mega multi-million dollar pots of money dreams all manipulating the people go
[44:14.360 --> 44:17.400]  into the private prison to visit their family don't even know the restaurants
[44:17.400 --> 44:22.080]  gas stations hotels are owned by the big mega bank that owns that consortium that
[44:22.080 --> 44:25.920]  actually shipped the drugs in that their son or daughter got caught using the
[44:25.920 --> 44:30.200]  troops grow the opium total blackout murder massive record suicide by the
[44:30.200 --> 44:35.440]  troops cancer virus is being injected in us total insanity again that's the type
[44:35.440 --> 44:38.800]  of collapse you're talking about let's go to Roy in Montana Royer on the air with
[44:38.800 --> 44:43.600]  Max Kaiser well thanks for taking my call brother Alex Mr. Kaiser good to
[44:43.600 --> 44:48.920]  talk you my question is I can't really afford gold and obviously it's gonna go
[44:48.920 --> 44:54.240]  way up do you think silver would be a good investment for somebody who can't
[44:54.240 --> 44:58.680]  afford gold or do you just this point just invest in you're talking to mr.
[44:58.680 --> 45:03.280]  silver right now max yeah silver of course they called the poor man's gold
[45:03.280 --> 45:07.880]  it's basically the same thing as owning gold it'll it'll operate the same thing
[45:07.880 --> 45:11.800]  you know gold and silver now more and more are being considered a currency the
[45:11.800 --> 45:16.880]  commodity at the CME in Chicago the commodity mercantile exchange just
[45:16.880 --> 45:21.760]  announced today that they are accepting gold as collateral that means for the
[45:21.760 --> 45:26.240]  first time now these commodity futures operations who are part of the banking
[45:26.240 --> 45:30.920]  system they they are so distrustful of the banks themselves that they are
[45:30.920 --> 45:35.080]  violating this idea that gold is somehow not a money they're saying now
[45:35.080 --> 45:38.960]  gold is a currency we will take gold as collateral so gold is seeping its way
[45:38.960 --> 45:43.600]  into the economy it's being monetized slowly but surely it is the only thing
[45:43.600 --> 45:46.600]  that's going to be left standing five thousand years of history will tell you
[45:46.600 --> 45:50.200]  that silver is just as good as gold in this environment if you don't want to buy
[45:50.200 --> 45:56.000]  pure silver you can buy junk silver which is 90% silver you know the 1964 or
[45:56.000 --> 45:59.800]  pretty everybody knows that those coins are and when all this paper fully goes
[45:59.800 --> 46:04.280]  down people are going to still be transacting it's going to be whiskey
[46:04.280 --> 46:11.680]  cigarettes silver gold bullets firearms food people that know how to fix things
[46:11.680 --> 46:18.720]  trades I mean that's where it's at yeah well Stacy my fiancee seem to be wife
[46:18.720 --> 46:23.680]  you know she has thousands of these miniature bottles of whiskey from the
[46:23.680 --> 46:28.600]  airplanes that she's going to use this currency she says by the way max yeah I've
[46:28.600 --> 46:32.160]  got a bunch of whiskey and stuff obviously not drinking and it's but I
[46:32.160 --> 46:35.920]  am joking but I do have a bunch of whiskey and stuff I mean I know that
[46:35.920 --> 46:38.680]  there's a good chance all this is going to happen I hope it doesn't but sir I
[46:38.680 --> 46:43.840]  hope that answers your question it it does and I and one quick follow-up what
[46:43.840 --> 46:48.880]  would that do with a person with a mortgage I mean if the dollar tanks and
[46:48.880 --> 46:52.640]  you know you owe your mortgage in dollars I mean how does that affect the
[46:52.640 --> 46:56.840]  average homeowner well sometimes well I mean max you answer it go ahead well
[46:56.840 --> 47:01.920]  theoretically you inflate the mortgage value away and it's quote-unquote good
[47:01.920 --> 47:05.480]  for the homeowner but I think we're in an environment where there's so much
[47:05.480 --> 47:11.520]  economic dislocation and there's so many other variables play here that it's not
[47:11.520 --> 47:16.040]  worth it in that sense but you mean your your point is well taken it's a good
[47:16.040 --> 47:20.520]  point but there are other things to consider and real estate as a class of
[47:20.520 --> 47:24.920]  investment is problematic for a number of reasons you know you have the the
[47:24.920 --> 47:29.200]  society breaking down you don't know with different neighborhoods today could
[47:29.200 --> 47:33.800]  suddenly become war zones next week you know there's a lot of things happening
[47:33.800 --> 47:37.640]  but your point is we'll take it it's a good point and I can't you know say it's
[47:37.640 --> 47:42.440]  not a good point all right thank you so much sir let's go to Jay in Texas you're
[47:42.440 --> 47:47.240]  on the air Jay hey how you doing max hey there's a article out in a veterans
[47:47.240 --> 47:51.600]  today about foreign cash just qualifies Romney from presidential bid something
[47:51.600 --> 47:55.720]  about him being over in Israel and Italy or London you know anything about that
[47:55.720 --> 47:59.960]  and I haven't seen that specific that particular article you know Romney of
[47:59.960 --> 48:05.000]  course is problematic for a number of different reasons you know the whole
[48:05.000 --> 48:10.840]  bane capital affiliation and everything that goes on there I don't
[48:10.840 --> 48:16.720]  understand why people would want to look at a guy who said his tax rate for the
[48:16.720 --> 48:22.480]  past five years is averaging about 13% so clearly he's not in the same country
[48:22.480 --> 48:26.640]  that we are living in he lives in some other country he's a foreigner he lives
[48:26.640 --> 48:31.360]  in no he lives in global country where the globalists are all above the law he
[48:31.360 --> 48:34.440]  can't really consider him to be an American he doesn't you know he pays
[48:34.440 --> 48:37.840]  taxes like he lives in the Cayman Islands so go to the Cayman Islands and
[48:37.840 --> 48:42.640]  leave us alone yeah I hear you you certainly had courage to live in France
[48:42.640 --> 48:47.160]  so you're going to the tax haven as they call it of England match let's go to
[48:47.160 --> 48:52.360]  mark in North Carolina you're on the air go ahead hey Alex max thanks for
[48:52.360 --> 48:55.800]  taking my call and dog on your answers several of my questions while I was
[48:55.800 --> 48:59.320]  sitting here waiting but I still have one good one I think and that's got to
[48:59.320 --> 49:03.480]  do with whether you've got points or arrow from seas or other items and
[49:03.480 --> 49:07.520]  including the silver and the gold once you have it what's the best ways or
[49:07.520 --> 49:11.280]  what's the best and safest bet for keeping it well I mean number one don't
[49:11.280 --> 49:14.800]  tell anybody about it but your spouse number two have guns to defend it be
[49:14.800 --> 49:18.560]  ready to use them and number three don't put all your eggs in one basket max
[49:18.560 --> 49:22.360]  Kaiser well my understanding is that infowars is opening up a huge warehouse
[49:22.360 --> 49:25.120]  down in Austin Texas to store everybody's precious metals that's why I
[49:25.120 --> 49:33.200]  send all mine don't with very funny max no okay so yes you make it you don't
[49:33.200 --> 49:37.520]  want obviously you're at risk if you have it in your home or you know what
[49:37.520 --> 49:40.800]  there's a lot of work on the web in terms of what people are doing with this
[49:40.800 --> 49:46.040]  personally there are services that you can get involved with that store your
[49:46.040 --> 49:51.080]  metals involves that are completely outside of the banking system I mean I
[49:51.080 --> 49:54.600]  mean there's all sorts of private lockers safety deposit boxes aren't a
[49:54.600 --> 49:57.960]  hundred percent safer but but the point is if you got in a couple of them you
[49:57.960 --> 50:01.440]  can always get the stuff out later so I mean I mean I'm just all over the place
[50:01.440 --> 50:06.160]  is basically it there's common sense you know you know you're right to be
[50:06.160 --> 50:10.840]  concerned you know from there there are a number of strategies you can use some you
[50:10.840 --> 50:14.960]  know each one is has pluses and minuses but it you know tied to your
[50:14.960 --> 50:18.520]  individual circumstance which I don't know but you know it's easy enough to get
[50:18.520 --> 50:23.880]  the the research on this yeah I'm also I'm investing in lead and the systems
[50:23.880 --> 50:32.480]  that project it and I'm also food and things like that well yeah but you know
[50:32.480 --> 50:39.240]  the funny thing is Portugal just announced that the folks there that are
[50:39.240 --> 50:44.040]  being exposed to austerity measures have just run out of all the gold that they
[50:44.040 --> 50:49.320]  can sell at the local pawn shop it's a swap no I know I know absolutely and the
[50:49.320 --> 50:52.920]  bankers drove the price down to hoard it themselves more calls straight ahead

[54:16.120 --> 54:20.000]  brainwashed people to be paranoid I think their neighbors are terrorists while
[54:20.000 --> 54:24.600]  the government runs al-qaeda publicly is an insane time to be alive max Kaiser
[54:24.600 --> 54:29.160]  is our guest for this little segment and the next and then in studio gonna have
[54:29.160 --> 54:32.520]  Joe Bannister in his lawyer political prisoner they tried to make him a
[54:32.520 --> 54:36.760]  political prisoner Joe Bannister former Treasury agent this is very important
[54:36.760 --> 54:41.240]  in light of all the corruption of the IRS coming out Logan in California you're
[54:41.240 --> 54:46.840]  on the air worldwide nice to talk to you AJ remember apathy is trees in my
[54:46.840 --> 54:55.000]  brother my question for Max Kaiser is I don't hear anybody speaking about
[54:55.000 --> 55:00.440]  commercial real estate and the fact that you can only claim a loss under
[55:00.440 --> 55:05.440]  business for five years before you have to declare bankruptcy and I believe that
[55:05.440 --> 55:09.560]  that is going to be one of the trigger mechanisms for the next collapse because
[55:09.560 --> 55:15.720]  housing real estate was the bubble that popped the first time and so I wanted to
[55:15.720 --> 55:19.920]  know what you thought about that max well all I can say is that I would agree
[55:19.920 --> 55:23.280]  with you okay that what you're saying is actually correct the commercial real
[55:23.280 --> 55:27.840]  estate sector is kind of a huge bubble for portions just like the student lung
[55:27.840 --> 55:32.360]  sector is a huge multi you know trillion dollar plus bubble ready to burst as
[55:32.360 --> 55:37.680]  well so there's still big bubbles yet to burst here in California everywhere I
[55:37.680 --> 55:43.360]  look strip malls or they have one business in a in ten units and every
[55:43.360 --> 55:48.600]  single one of them has a for rent sign for sale sign and they've been sitting
[55:48.600 --> 55:53.720]  for years I have friends jump in here so think that through for a second so
[55:53.720 --> 55:56.320]  in other words you got this commercial real estate that's vacant does not
[55:56.320 --> 56:01.760]  generate any any income it's backed by bonds collateralized bonds of nature
[56:01.760 --> 56:05.920]  mortgage collateralized bonds which have been sold back and forth amongst banks
[56:05.920 --> 56:08.640]  and those banks when they sell those back and forth to each other they value
[56:08.640 --> 56:11.560]  them for a hundred cents on the dollar none of the banks yet have said wait a
[56:11.560 --> 56:14.600]  minute the strip malls are empty those bonds are not worth a hundred cents in
[56:14.600 --> 56:17.760]  the dollar they're worth only five cents in the dollar no one's done that yet they
[56:17.760 --> 56:21.400]  keep trading them back and forth for fees and they're allowed to do that because
[56:21.400 --> 56:26.160]  they do it a really off balance sheet they do it on the dark exchange they do
[56:26.160 --> 56:31.040]  it outside of the regulators eyes and so as a result you have this building
[56:31.040 --> 56:35.760]  Mount Vestuvius of bad debt that's building on the balance sheets of these
[56:35.760 --> 56:40.080]  banks JP Morgan classic example ninety trillion dollars worth of derivatives
[56:40.080 --> 56:43.680]  trillions of dollars worth of bad commercial real estate debt and it's
[56:43.680 --> 56:48.840]  not being exposed because the well said thank you Logan gotta jump Terry in
[56:48.840 --> 56:56.120]  Canada you're on the air go ahead Alex Max thank you very much guys I was
[56:56.120 --> 57:03.000]  first introduced to Max Mike Maloney and when the air guitar the sex pistols he
[57:03.000 --> 57:09.320]  had me hooked so my question is Bank of Canada governor is Mark Carney does
[57:09.320 --> 57:13.360]  double-duty at the Bank of International Settlement so my exact
[57:13.360 --> 57:18.760]  question is is the Bank of Canada buying gold and once this financial collapse
[57:18.760 --> 57:24.680]  happens where does Canada fit into it all being the biggest trader with the
[57:24.680 --> 57:29.720]  US well Carney's an interesting case because of course just six months ago
[57:29.720 --> 57:34.320]  Jamie Diamond CEO JP Morgan was lecturing Carney on why he needs to
[57:34.320 --> 57:37.760]  reduce his minimum capital reserve requirements in that country because
[57:37.760 --> 57:40.520]  doesn't he know that selling more derivatives is the best interest of
[57:40.520 --> 57:43.520]  all the bankers around the world you know Carney said you know get lost punk
[57:43.520 --> 57:47.800]  and for that reason you have to give them big kudos and they went through a
[57:47.800 --> 57:51.000]  huge banking crisis in early 90s they recapitulate everything you know the
[57:51.000 --> 57:54.720]  Canadian banks are basically nationalized they're not so they have a
[57:54.720 --> 57:59.600]  much more strict oversight of their glass fecal because they've done that
[57:59.600 --> 58:02.720]  previously and got into trouble with it great points we're gonna come back to
[58:02.720 --> 58:06.320]  five more minutes with Max Kaiser of Max Kaiser comm again if you just tuned in
[58:06.320 --> 58:10.880]  I'm Alex Jones of info wars.com no we're not dry old fake left-wing media

[58:15.280 --> 58:19.720]  fables we're looking for real reality and freedom in our time I hope Max
[58:19.720 --> 58:22.440]  Kaiser is wrong he says it's gonna happen in the next six seven months by
[58:22.440 --> 58:26.640]  next April total collapse I hope he's wrong but there's a good chance he's
[58:26.640 --> 58:30.560]  going to be right the globalists could always have some new bubbles some new
[58:30.560 --> 58:34.640]  scams some new thing they do but Max has never said it's coming down now he's
[58:34.640 --> 58:38.360]  saying that and a lot of our other experts are that's super creepy we're

[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:08.960]  it's just somehow we got to turn this around try to educate as many military
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:13.040]  and police because the globalist plan on having a civil war in this country that
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:18.760]  they trigger instead of having us come together and fixing the system and you
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:23.400]  know I've grown up I'm older I'm not that old but I just when I was 20 you know
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:27.280]  I was a little more I will just have a war now I mean I didn't want it then
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:33.440]  either but now I've lived enough to know what a bad idea that is even though
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:37.400]  we'll totally crush the globalist forces that's part of the plan and then
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:41.520]  then the real globalists should sit off sure max keiser is our guest so be sure

[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:06.640]  going on here just I'm about two hours outside of Chicago close to a little
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:10.200]  place called Gary Indian I don't know if you guys know about it but it's a
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:16.880]  suspect that basically just rampant crime but what they're doing here is they've
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:22.080]  opened up their opening up I should say several churches in and around the area
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:29.080]  to confiscate guns so you bring your guns in and basically get a 15 $25 Walmart
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:34.200]  gift card so and that's just happened Wednesday I just heard on the radio here
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:39.360]  local radio station was just broadcasting it here yeah like I said a
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:47.000]  couple days ago sure take on that max well Walmart it is the the company store
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.280]  on the plantation you know every dollar you save a Walmart you destroy a buck
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:56.040]  15 wages if you shop at Walmart you're putting yourself into a wage less
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:59.280]  prison environment it's as simple as that same thing with target though they're
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:04.320]  all the same yeah okay but the Walmart is the biggest employer I mean it wrote
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:11.240]  the book but but it's now even being slave marted out worse by Amazon possibly
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:16.200]  but in other words the the the retailing environment right to the bottom
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:20.080]  right to the bottom yeah it's okay the race to the bottom I mean maybe you want
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:24.920]  to segue into a discussion about guns I mean that's a different discussion yeah
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:28.080]  but I mean I was interrupting give us in closing your take on what's happening
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:34.000]  to retail well no it's the it's the race the bottom you know I was trying to come
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.240]  up with a good metaphor for this this transition to this total collapse state
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:41.600]  and you know you see in nature all the time Alex you know the transition in
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:45.160]  these in these system dynamics when there's a when there's a shift you know
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:50.840]  when you have water for example retains a lot of heat and then suddenly it only
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:55.960]  takes one degree to go from water to vapor okay that's a sister's a phase
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:04:00.680]  shift and that's what I'm talking about the heat is the water the system is
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:06.400]  heating up yes systems breakdown and once we get that one final degree shift
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:12.000]  and complexity and outrage you have a phase shift from water to steam and
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.760]  steam compared to water is extremely you know unstable yes and that's the
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:21.960]  society that we're heading for in 2013 something extremely unstable so you say
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:26.200]  collapse you mean lots of instability crazy stuff's going on and the globalist
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:30.280]  know the shifts happening so they want to flip it like judo and take all that
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:33.320]  rage and use it for them to take over but you're saying you don't see things
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:40.000]  going well for him or will they stay in control I think they're in good shape
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.960]  Alex we're gonna have to have you back up very soon thank you so much Max I
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:47.240]  want to see it where you think all this is going Max Kaiser's been our guest we

[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:13.520]  vulnerable it is that's in the mainstream news every day millions of people have
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:17.360]  lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:21.920]  heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity I've always said that every
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:25.920]  family needs to be ready for blackouts and if you don't have a backup system

[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:47.520]  because they're solar powered that means there's no dangerous fumes and no
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:53.120]  noise info wars listeners can get all the details at beat the blackouts.com

[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:11.160]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:24.240]  you know I should have hyped this up better but our listeners know that we
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:29.840]  tend to be all bite and no bark as they say we've had a lot of amazing gas in
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:33.840]  the last few days we just had Max Kaiser on yesterday we had Richard Belzer
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:39.920]  along with Christopher Walken and Dave Mustain with an exclusive response to the
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:45.280]  big national story so I'm really proud of the info wars radio TV show and I'm
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:49.440]  also very proud of my crew and and the great work they're doing and the
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:56.480]  sponsors the AM and FM affiliates XM 166 everybody our sponsors we couldn't do
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:02.480]  this without you and it also shows that liberty is popular now I knew this
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:06.880]  because I'd followed the trial and I think once even maybe even trying to
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:11.520]  call you a chance a guest but who knows I didn't even really realize until I was
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:14.520]  sitting in here with Jill Bannister we had on earlier in the week be a phone
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:18.480]  and of course I've been interviewing now for about 14 years or so or 13 years
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:24.200]  but since about 99 right and so it's like it's about 13 years he is here in
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:31.000]  studio with us and Robert G Bernhoft is also here in studio with us he was
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:37.280]  webs Wesley Snipes lawyer who got him off on all of the felonies with the IRS
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:44.360]  and when they arrested Joe Bannister for his thought crimes a few years ago Mr.
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:48.720]  Bernhoft was able to get a night I don't want to say get him off because he
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:52.800]  didn't do anything but the point is it's hard to beat the criminal IRS and I'm
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:56.400]  very excited I didn't know this I knew that you were I guess in the Midwest or
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:00.280]  was it Milwaukee Milwaukee Wisconsin Alex yeah yes so now you've moved to Austin
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:04.360]  Texas so I was saying during the break you know if I ever need a good lawyer
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:07.800]  thank God you're here I should be groveling because I mean it's hard to
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:13.120]  find good lawyers but just amazing to have both of you here in studio Robert G
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:20.320]  Bernhoft and again the website is Bernhoft law.com b-e-r-n-h-o-f-t law.com
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:26.080]  and Joe Bannister agent for truth.com so gentlemen I don't know where to start
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:29.680]  where should we start here today well first of all we came down to Austin my
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:32.520]  firm did because that's where all the troublemakers are we figured this is a
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:36.040]  good place to be but and that's partly true but we're really liking it here in
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:40.920]  Austin great people a lot of energy and of course this show is here so we're
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:44.320]  having fun yeah now that you're here in town look out well you're our legal
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:48.680]  expert good to have you here thank you in fact I want to get you on the TV show
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:51.880]  tonight so hopefully next time you're both in town come back because I forgot
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:57.280]  I'm shooting them for a documentary film today a film cruise here so we've got to
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:02.440]  work it out somehow to get that done okay I'm excited I'm gonna shut up tell us
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:06.840]  about your take on the IRS the big scandals coming out all the rest of the
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:10.200]  corruption it seems like the veil is lifting that we really do have a
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:15.200]  corporate mafia in control that exempts itself from the fraudulent laws that
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:19.040]  they put in place yeah I think that's right Alex and one of the hot topics in
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:23.880]  academic commentators the federal judiciary and defense practitioners is
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:27.960]  government misconduct after former senator Ted Stevens in the subordination
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:32.120]  of perjury falsification of evidence and the scandal about that what we're
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:35.920]  seeing what I'm seeing now is a cascade of investigative and prosecutorial
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:39.880]  misconduct that's infecting the courts the difference now over the past four or
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:44.520]  five years is that it's being exposed to some extent we will never know what's
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:48.200]  sort of investigative or prosecutorial misconduct lay behind chose
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:53.080]  investigation and prosecution because we were we did not get all the discover
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:56.680]  we were entitled to but I remember getting the call from Joe after the
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:01.520]  arrest and that was a really that was a traumatic time I know for him and his
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:05.440]  family and we were we were able to jump in and help them we were grateful to be
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:10.680]  able to do it let's go through that case before Wesley Snipes because I mean
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:14.320]  you're just winning and winning and winning in a system where it's almost
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:20.360]  impossible to win Tommy Crier God bless him died this year he was able to
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:23.600]  defeat them when you can get a jury trial I mean is that how you're able to do
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:27.400]  this actually exposing the fraud absolutely the the last bastion of
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:31.360]  freedom the interposition between the government power and the executive and
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:37.560]  the citizens citizens like Joe is the jury now there's unfortunately the
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:42.360]  quality of the jurors that we're seeing in jury pools it's a function of American
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:45.400]  culture we have a lot of people that watch too much TV that listen to
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:48.880]  government propaganda it's very difficult to get free thinking
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:53.040]  individualist type people on juries so one of the things that you have to do is
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:57.520]  pay attention to your jury selection Joe's jury we like diversity on our
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:01.480]  juries and I'll be you know be candid about this for example the African
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:05.920]  American community has a different perspective of the system than white
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:10.200]  America does generally they've had an experience with the system they're
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:15.120]  suspicious of system state not as naive I would that's a great way to put it and
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:20.680]  they're more inclined to think and listen carefully to what otherwise other
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:23.920]  Americans might shut out you know how could it be that the government who
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:27.920]  wears the white hats indicts a good guy well you know the government comes into
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:30.680]  court with the white hats on Joe's supposed to have the black hat on and
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:35.240]  our trial theme was no they indicted the good guy and so we tried to switch the
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:39.640]  hats and that's a tough concept for most Americans but thank God we still have
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:43.640]  jury trials in all of our criminal cases and unanimity is required it's got to be
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:48.560]  12 unanimous jurors giving a unanimous verdict and that's your last chance
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:52.120]  that's your last chance to defend yourself the other thing that's going on
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:57.880]  of course is it's a an exemplar of despotic systems that they use their
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:03.080]  judicial process to single out and punish dissenters that's always been the
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:07.400]  case throughout world history but it's a real shame and it's a disgrace that the
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:12.080]  American federal criminal judicial process increasingly is being used as a
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:17.680]  forum to target and punish principal dissenters and so that's that's the state
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:22.480]  of the American judicial process today well it's scary it's like you say Joe
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:25.960]  hey I'm not saying don't pay him even though it's all a fraud they'll break
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:28.960]  your legs I mean no they'll worse than that they'll put you in prison for 20
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:32.080]  years and take everything you got rather have my legs broken than that 10
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:35.960]  times I mean this is vicious what you went through I know most our listeners
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:41.680]  are aware of your story but look at what happened to you know just the guest I had
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:45.640]  on the other day the IRS sure yeah yeah sherry peel Jackson I mean she did
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:50.400]  nothing wrong and for her speech look at Erwin Schiff in prison for a book in
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:54.800]  America book burning book burning is alive in America we don't burn them
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:58.640]  anymore we issue injunctions against their publication and dissemination and
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:03.360]  that's what the court issued against shift prior to the criminal trial the
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:06.800]  court enjoined shift from printing and publishing his book upon pain of
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:10.560]  contempt I mean it's interesting that even the library association of America
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:15.000]  came out in support of shift on that point and it's also interesting that in
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:21.800]  an age where court decisions have said that free speech covers a books on how
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:28.320]  to stalk torture and kill people how to identify and and groom children for
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:31.400]  sexual abuse and that's free speech you know that stuff's out there that's okay
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:35.280]  but God forbid someone like Erwin Schiff wants to print his thoughts and
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:39.560]  research conclusions about the scope and nature of the tax that's something you
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:43.080]  burn the book well I mean he found the key to it and proved all their fraud
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:47.040]  after decades of research and they said you're going to a dungeon yeah and the
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:51.120]  other the other speech the other you know the other types of speech that you
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:54.960]  know I'm libertarian but nevertheless some of that speech is abhorrent first
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:58.680]  amendment covers that but it doesn't cover Erwin yeah you have to protect the
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:01.640]  abhorrent stuff or we lose our good stuff that's right you know there was a
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:05.720]  famous Supreme Court justice that made it really a great profound comment we
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:10.400]  tolerate the speech we hate because someday our speech might be hated so
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:13.120]  I'm good with that I'm a libertarian I believe in the principles of this
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:17.360]  country but what we're having now is selective identification of speech that
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:24.480]  the state deems subversive harmful or dangerous back in the old days frankly
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:29.480]  we used to talk about our founders and the Middle Ages and then 1600 1700s and
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:33.920]  all there was torture going on in terms of criminal punishment and now we're so
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:37.960]  much more civilized and I don't think that's the case in fact no they just
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:42.000]  make it more sophisticated and more covers that's there's more velvet gloves
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.640]  that's right we're gonna say interrupted no it has that it has a
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:48.800]  perception of being more civilized but in fact if you were a heretic heretic
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:52.360]  before in the colonies you know and you you said something that was they
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:55.520]  considered blasphemous they put you in the stock for a day a little public
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:59.000]  humiliation then they you know repatriated you to your family at your
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.600]  home they had to live in a community and today we're much more civilized we we
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:06.480]  try and put people like Joe banister in federal prison for 15 16 years and
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:10.320]  they're now grabbing people I've seen that have protested us you know the
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:14.600]  famous doctor case what sell up in Missouri where he's been in there for
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:20.080]  15 years now forced drug they never having a trial but he's in prison drug
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:24.600]  for Medicare Medicaid fraud they claimed I mean now they drug you or
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:28.400]  electro shock you because of your views that's like the old Soviet Union it's
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:33.680]  barbaric it's absolutely barbaric and when you take a look at the US sentencing
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:37.800]  guidelines which determines sentencing ranges and we took a take a look at the
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:41.720]  so-called white collar guidelines particularly regarding tax and you have
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:44.960]  people that you know failed to pay a little bit of tax on a couple years of
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:49.640]  income and the sentencing ranges can be 5 to 10 years in federal prison you know
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:53.400]  everything is upside down you can beat you can be out of a state prison in
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:57.480]  California on a murder one-chart 6.9 years something like that you know but
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:01.400]  if you run a file of the IRS look forward to a double-digit sentence and
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:05.400]  this is systematic this is not you know this isn't accidental this is
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:10.640]  absolute intentional policy that's being passed by Congress enforced by its
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:15.600]  agency the Internal Revenue Service and this guy have a radio show no
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:20.520]  wonder he's winning with all these juries hey wow amazing again we have
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:24.600]  Joe Bannister and Robert G. Bernhoft his incredible lawyer you got to go to
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:28.680]  bernhofflaw.com because I followed your cases and then I'm running around here
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:31.880]  with 20 things happening and you guys are here and then it kind of recollects
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:35.040]  you know Joe goes you know he's the guy that's won all these other cases too and
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:39.520]  I'm just realizing how rare that is why have you been so successful when very
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:42.800]  few others have we're gonna skip this break because it's so important guys go
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:46.440]  ahead yeah the conviction rate generally is a roundabout body temperature in
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:52.400]  federal criminal trials 95 96% take your statistic the way we approach these
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:55.440]  cases is first of all we have aggressive motion practice to get the
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:59.640]  discovery that our clients are entitled to and there's various rules and cases so
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:03.080]  we're very aggressive about getting discovery and the devils in the details
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:06.760]  and the government's thematics and sometimes investigative misconduct
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:11.240]  lurks in the discovery and then we prepare it's about preparation mastery
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:15.240]  of information and it's also having an understanding of human nature you know
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:18.200]  this is an age where we want to change human nature we don't want to acknowledge
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:23.040]  it we acknowledge the functions of human nature how it plays out and you know
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:28.800]  court trials are our theater dramatics where the stakes are very very high you
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:32.040]  have to understand what makes people tick when you pick a jury you have to
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:36.200]  look at those people as individuals ask them a few questions and they will tell
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:40.600]  you things about themselves without even realizing it so jury selection and
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:45.920]  Joe assisted me at council table jury selection in his trial and you have to
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:49.440]  have good people instincts and you have to be aggressive and you have to know the
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:55.200]  law but picking a jury is crucially important as it was in Joe's case and
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:20:00.800]  you're right it is theater people say why do they do a year or 14 month million
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:04.760]  dollar investigation of Amish selling cheese and milk to their neighbors turns
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:08.040]  out the neighbors have moved in and demand they sell them their milk and
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.000]  cheese at their communities eating so they could take it across state lines
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.440]  and sell it to make it a federal case then they swat team them and get them
[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:18.760]  down on the ground when they're a known non-violent sect for 400 years and you
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:22.680]  know a lot and all of this goes on people say why do they do that so they
[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:26.360]  can show an ignorant jury who doesn't know what Amish are doesn't know the
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:30.640]  history of anything like look they're bad we wouldn't have swat team them and
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:35.080]  all of it is just dress-up theater absolutely increasingly you know
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:39.120]  especially in tax cases especially in non-filing and I'm not afraid to say
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:44.200]  tax protester cases I mean I did the case in Boston a few months ago and they
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:47.880]  were completing building the Tea Party Museum right there inside of the
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:52.400]  courthouse and so we took the government's epithet it's defamatory
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:56.280]  epithet and we said no we'll accept that that's right my clients are principal
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:21:00.840]  tax protesters and they're protesting taxation without explanation
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:04.600]  roll letters to the IRS asked for the code section that made them liable no
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:09.400]  answers and we reached that jury on a pretty good level so it is drama and
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:13.680]  increasingly these prosecutions are done by misleading the jury about things
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:17.600]  they don't know about can't be expected to know misleading the jury about tax
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:22.040]  law about how accounting is done and in Joe's case of course it's just the
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:26.800]  drumbeat that this guy is dangerous if you don't convict this guy he's gonna
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:31.600]  get to the children but if we rediscover 1776 common sense says the
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:35.840]  government's dangerous absolutely we were very aggressive in Joe's trial my
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:40.440]  co-counsel Jeff Dixon did an incredible job and he put to the jury which side is
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:44.840]  the con on which side is the con on they charge Joe banister with conspiracy
[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:50.240]  conspiracy was a conspiracy and we put it to the jury with you cannot win these
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:55.080]  cases by half measures you can't go in there with soft themes I agree people say
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:59.920]  wake up America being nice no I I never calculated anything I'm aggressive like
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:03.920]  a bull in a china shop that's what gets results the truth that's right and you
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:08.080]  have to break through the barriers of people from seeing the truth and you
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:11.640]  look at you look at Joe's case again I mean he was did you go with this angle
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:15.520]  to I mean because I follow trial some of the news was so busy you know which is
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:18.480]  falling into paper and talking to Joe some on the phone but I you know don't
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:22.760]  have a little inside stuff but I would have made the point he was moving up he
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:27.680]  had a career he had everything he just did this to warn people of the truth why
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:32.240]  would he lose everything that's there the liars that is that is a really
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:35.560]  interesting point because the government's playbook and criminal taxes
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:40.200]  greed you know he chose to play and then they point to the jury while you chose
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:45.200]  to pay they create class economic heavy and respond and responsibility envy they
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:50.240]  tried to trap that female in Joe's case argument especially you lost
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:53.640]  everything yeah he put everything on the line and yet the greed was the
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:58.160]  function the factor it was extraordinary wasn't plausible and and the jury
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:01.760]  didn't buy it did you tell the story how he set out to disprove the tax protesters
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:05.600]  absolutely there was a tons of great testimony and evidence and of course Joe
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:11.120]  being a man of integrity had former colleagues that were videotaped in a
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:15.240]  deposition talking about what a great special agent he was the integrity the
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:19.720]  discipline the work ethic so it was a tough go for the government and that was
[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:22.680]  their evidence but it blew up in their face that's right they put the evidence
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:26.360]  of just I find that more and more they'll stand up a huge room of like 500
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:30.800]  Marines officers and say you will not watch Alex Jones you will make give
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:34.480]  people demerits and and and write them up and we'll kick them out if they watch
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:37.840]  it three times and then all of them go watch it until and then and then tell
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:41.080]  everybody to watch so the whole military is watching because for ten years they
[01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:46.040]  tell them don't watch it I mean the system is so disconnected from reality
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:49.400]  they seem to be their own worst enemy have you found that they are alienated
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:55.040]  from where America is really at they are disconnected they believe their own
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:58.440]  they believe the own their own fantasies and the things they want
[01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:01.880]  everybody else to believe and they just assume people believe that but when
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:06.000]  you've got Joe standing up there with the New York Times investigative reporter
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.840]  and a Pulitzer Prize winner and he's asking questions and taking notes and
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:13.360]  Joe is expressing some views and beliefs that he has the government thought
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:18.600]  this was sedition of the first order and the jury looked at him and said well
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:23.360]  gosh he's thoughtful he's speaking his mind I mean that's a crime and the
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:27.600]  government's theory was in fact that was a crime that was a conspiracy to defraud
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:31.320]  the United States and your motto nails that there's a war on for your mind
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:37.440]  there's a war on and for the jurors mind because all that propaganda and all
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:41.080]  that conditioning all throughout their lives the government just wants that to
[01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:45.000]  stick long enough to convict the defendant people like you and but when
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.280]  you have somebody that can communicate your innocence it snaps them out of
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:53.120]  that let me ask you this going through the fire but also getting to defend
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:56.400]  people like Joe because I've noticed you only take cases where it's really clear
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:59.800]  that you know the government's totally in the wrong there and still that's an
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:04.720]  uphill battle how good does it feel to actually find a niche in this increasingly
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:10.280]  corrupt world where you do get to do I mean do get to do good work well I I
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:14.720]  tell people all the time I am an extraordinary lucky individual because I
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:19.880]  actually we actually make a difference once in a while and and even moving more
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:24.040]  transcendently from helping Joe and his family and avoiding 15 16 years in
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:27.320]  federal prison that that would be gratifying but we do get to make a
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:31.320]  difference on a larger scale that's a really that's a blessing in today's
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:34.720]  world you don't get to do that very often we take it very seriously it's
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:38.160]  something I'll tell you one thing before the jury came back with the verdict in
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:42.640]  Joe's case and I kind of leaned over to him and I said look you know I don't know
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:46.480]  where this is going we've got a pretty good feeling but when loser draw when
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:50.880]  that jury verdict comes in you know we're gonna be even keel don't let him
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:54.240]  do it to it we're gonna walk out of this at the courtroom one way or the other
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:57.520]  with your head held up high you're entitled to that they can't take that
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:03.240]  away from you if it's a victory we'll celebrate outside you know and and and
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:06.080]  that was that was one of the most emotional moments of my life when that
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:09.960]  jury verdict was returned that was a special agent that investigated me well
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:14.280]  I want Bob to tell you what he said to Bob upon my acquittal yeah he I came over
[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:17.640]  to I think it was special agent Breslin there's Howard and Breslin I went over to
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:22.360]  special agent Breslin and I mean yes he had tears running down his face and he
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:26.720]  looked at me and he said thank you counselor for taking care of our boy
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:31.320]  Joe and I was just because there they are pretty much even having to testify
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:34.760]  against him imagine the guilt they were going through yeah they because when you
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:37.560]  do evil things it comes back on you that's right and it was a political
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:41.520]  prosecution political persecution everybody knew that and and and those
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:45.120]  special agents that used to work with Joe they knew he was a man of integrity
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:49.560]  they knew he didn't have any intent to commit any crime and so for that he
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:52.840]  didn't want to commit a crime carrying out the IRS stuff that's right so he has
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:57.360]  a crisis of conscience but knowing who Joe was and I was that was unexpected I
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:01.880]  did not expect that to get a handshake and a congratulations counselor from
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:06.160]  an elite special agents when a Joe's former colleagues very exciting story
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:11.080]  what about Wesley Snipes we've had so many famous trials and you got him you
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:14.720]  know to not go to prison for all the fake stuff yeah that was that was a really
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:19.520]  tough case because you know we were in Ocala Florida everybody thought that he
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.960]  couldn't get a fair trial down there is going to be an all-white jury and it
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:26.240]  wasn't all white jury but but I picked that jury and I'm and I like that jury
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:31.160]  I thought I picked some really thoughtful people down there and and you know
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:34.280]  the problem with representing a high-profile celebrity is the fact of
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:38.120]  their high profile the everything changes it becomes surreal there's an
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:42.240]  entourage there was massive media down there and everything gets distorted so
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:45.960]  we actually had to try that case outside the courtroom as well as inside that's
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:50.240]  the big difference between a noncelebrity so many small-time lawyers you
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:53.720]  aren't you know super professional like yourself they don't get there always
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:58.120]  don't talk to the media and I'm like no it's a media war oh I mean the
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:01.080]  prosecutors they know that they're out there given their press releases
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:06.040]  prosecution issued a press release that Wesley Snipes was a fugitive and he was
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:10.160]  in Namibia a shooting gala walker if I'm not mistaken they don't have an
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:13.760]  extradition treaty at all with the United States Wesley could have stayed in
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:17.480]  Namibia for a good long time but his attorneys were negotiating with the
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:20.960]  government his surrender so out there in the media and the jurors here this
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:25.360]  potential jurors here this oh he fled he's a fugitive he won't come back that's
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:28.500]  evidence of that shows that fraud I mean they're saying he's a criminal he's
[01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:31.820]  wrong when he had we had a fight that you have to go out to the media and
[01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:35.760]  dispel the misinformation propaganda to get yourself back to a level playing
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:39.280]  field and if you don't do that you lose and you lose bat and Wesley goes to
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:42.040]  prison for 16 years well I have a view of the law not that I'm a lawyer but I
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:46.240]  studied it a bit that even if somebody's guilty if the if the system
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:50.440]  cheats the danger of the system cheating is more dangerous than a guilty
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:53.440]  person not going to jail there's no question about that and that's why the
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:56.620]  discovery violations and the cascading misconduct into federal courts
[01:28:56.620 --> 01:29:01.320]  particularly is crucially important to stop and remedy an exceptional event
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:05.240]  occurred Judge Richard Tallman a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals judge after the
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:09.520]  Stevens case issued an open letter to Attorney General Holder really an
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:12.680]  unprecedented event when a judge speaks to the executive branch at such a high
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:16.440]  level and it's a public letter and he says look at the paraphrasing look Mr.
[01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:35.640]  Holder
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:51.440]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.

[01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:01.440]  Sick of the globalist eugenesis control freaks adding poison to your water

[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:05.440]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:07.440]  My friends, I've done a lot of research
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:11.440]  and the best gravity filter out there, Bar Nun, is ProPure
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:16.440]  available discounted at infowars.com. Its filters are silver and pregnant
[01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:19.440]  to prevent bacterial growth. There's no priming required.

[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:31.440]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells.
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:34.440]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:38.440]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:41.440]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:46.440]  It's what my family uses. Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.

[01:32:56.440 --> 01:33:03.440]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:33.440]  We've got a lot of stuff to talk about. The websites to check out are
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:35.440]  AgentForTruth.com. That's Joe Bannister.
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:41.440]  And there's Robert or Bob G. Bernhoff's website, Bernhofflaw.com.
[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:45.440]  And I can tell you, if I ever have the collection agency for the Private Federal Reserve
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:48.440]  come after me, I know who I'm going to get right over here.
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:51.440]  I hope I can get him. You were telling me that I was saying,
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:56.440]  boy, I bet killing is their business and business is good for them.
[01:33:56.440 --> 01:34:00.440]  I bet you trying to save people. I bet your business is just booming.
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:07.440]  You know, it is. And it's a bit of a mental torture because business is business.
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:10.440]  And in making a living, there's nothing to apologize for making a living.
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:12.440]  But it's grueling, too.
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:15.440]  It is. It takes its toll. And you deal with a lot of human road meat.
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:19.440]  The grist mill of the government, they grind people up, spit them out, don't look back.
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:23.440]  And it's particularly in trials where you have convictions.
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:26.440]  Those are extraordinarily difficult.
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:28.440]  You get to know people very well over a two-three-year period.
[01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:34.440]  If there's not a good outcome at trial, you don't sleep very well for a very, very long time.
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:37.440]  I remember the good ones, and there have been plenty of those.
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:39.440]  Because it's like a fight, isn't it?
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:43.440]  I mean, and if you lose as a man, you really feel like you lost.
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:46.440]  Oh, yeah. I disappear for several weeks after any trial.
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:50.440]  Win, lose, or draw. I just kind of disappear for a while and get my head together.
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:53.440]  You know, we use sort of symbolism of combat, and it is.
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:55.440]  I called up the government in case the other day.
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:59.440]  I said, boy, is y'all ready to sheath your swords and stop the bloodletting?
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:02.440]  They were kind of shocked by that, and they kind of paused for 10 or 15 minutes.
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:05.440]  I mean, but that's what it is. Trials are combat.
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:08.440]  And I tell my clients, some of them really want to charge forward to trial,
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:11.440]  and there's too much machismo going on.
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:14.440]  And I say, look, a couple of things I want to mention.
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:18.440]  There's going to be blood everywhere, and we're going to measure the victors by the buckets of blood.
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:21.440]  That's reality at trials.
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:24.440]  And secondly, I always get to go home after the trials.
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:26.440]  You have to have a sense of humility.
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:29.440]  It's better to win the war strategically by never getting to the battlefield.
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:31.440]  Oh, no question.
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:34.440]  And of course, we do a lot of representation that nobody sees doesn't make the news
[01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:38.440]  where we're helping people out of audits, collection, criminal investigations.
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:41.440]  Just letting the IRS know, hey, go pick on somebody else.
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:45.440]  Well, I think there is an element to that because, you know, we practice aggressively,
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:47.440]  but collegially and professionally.
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:51.440]  And I think my counterparts in the government that are opposite me respect that.
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:56.440]  So, yeah, I think we do help our clients just by entering the fray and solving problems
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:00.440]  rather than just trial work. We do a ton of other stuff that nobody sees.
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:03.440]  Yeah, I've noticed that because I've got a really good lawyer here in town,
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:07.440]  and it just immediately gets people's attention.
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:11.440]  A lot of times pretty big operations stuff comes up from time to time.
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:14.440]  Immediately, if you have a small lawyer, I mean, I mean, you know that,
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:17.440]  but for the audience, I'm just telling them that it really does matter.
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:21.440]  Well, it does matter. And the other thing is that we're not, you know,
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:26.440]  increasingly a huge percentage of federal criminal indictments are resolved by plea agreement.
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:30.440]  And there's a very, there's a huge coercion from the sentencing guidelines.
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:33.440]  I mean, you've got a businessman, he's indicted for tax.
[01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:37.440]  If he gets sting with a felony count at trial, he does seven to eight years,
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:39.440]  maybe the plea is 18 months, 24 months.
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:43.440]  So this has a hugely coercive effect to get pleas.
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:47.440]  Now, when we come to a case, we do trials, we're not afraid of trials,
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:49.440]  and we win a lot of our trials.
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:52.440]  So immediately our government counterparts understand,
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:54.440]  okay, this isn't going to be a bag man plea case.
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:58.440]  This case could go to trial and they start counting their cost and their risk.
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:36:59.440]  You know, what's the problem?
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:02.440]  Yeah, they'd rather feed on a bunch of innocent old ladies, ruin their lives,
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:04.440]  grab wedding rings off their fingers.
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:06.440]  You know, just let them commit suicide,
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:09.440]  than actually go up against people that'll fight back.
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:11.440]  They operate like muggers.
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:13.440]  Well, easy targets, easy targets.
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:16.440]  When you have a predator type of system,
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:19.440]  those predators will go after the easy targets
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:21.440]  because it's the path of least resistance.
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:23.440]  Well, you know what you're talking about,
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:25.440]  because I've just experienced this 17 years on air
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:28.440]  and getting out there and doing stuff up against these crooks.
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:32.440]  And that's how I see it. Some of them are deadly do-rights from my experience
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:35.440]  who are stupid and are made fun of by the higher-ups.
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:37.440]  That's really how this works.
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:40.440]  But these are just criminals on the top that know exactly what they're doing.
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:43.440]  And I don't know how they sleep at night wrecking the families,
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:45.440]  doing the things they've done to people.
[01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:48.440]  Yeah, you know, the rationalization, justification for putting people in prison
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:51.440]  for double digits over tax, by the way,
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:54.440]  we're the only country of the so-called civilized industrial nations
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:56.440]  that has criminal tax at all.
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:58.440]  Criminal tax is the exception.
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:02.440]  Now, Russia, former Soviet Union, Russia, North Korea, China
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:05.440]  knows a wonderful series of countries that have a criminal tax regime.
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:07.440]  That's not good company.
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:09.440]  We should not have criminal tax in the United States.
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:11.440]  Oh, that's my next question for you.
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:15.440]  When Joe Poppin, any time, you know, they grab the kids in Russia,
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:18.440]  the orphans, trying to be tax enforcers, and they beat you up as well.
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:20.440]  So I guess it's only country worse than us.
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:22.440]  Well, I mean, you're the expert. Is Russia worse than the U.S.?
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:24.440]  Yeah, well, the Russian tax police,
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:26.440]  that's a whole different world.
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:28.440]  Really a mafia, man.
[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:30.440]  It is, but the fact is, is that civilized nations,
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:33.440]  truly civilized nations do not criminalize something like tax.
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:35.440]  If you owe the government money,
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:38.440]  the government has plenty of mechanisms to get that money from you.
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:41.440]  But to put people in prison for owing tax liability
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:43.440]  or not filing the proper form.
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:46.440]  North Korea, China, Russia, Nazi Germany, not a good company.
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:48.440]  Well, you know, that's the company we're in.
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:51.440]  And I argued with David K. Johnson from the New York Times about that.
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:56.440]  He was appalled by my idea that criminal tax demonstrated we were uncivilized.
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:57.440]  Well, it does.
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:59.440]  And I've argued with Nathan Halkman,
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:02.440]  former Assistant U.S. Attorney General Tax Division for the United States.
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:04.440]  He was appalled by that notion.
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:06.440]  Let me ask you a question. I want to go back to the Wesley Snip
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:09.440]  because we got cut off by a break, then we went off in another direction.
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:10.440]  But finish up on this point.
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:13.440]  Is all the criminality and government coming out in triplicate
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:16.440]  and the fact that the IRS is giving out fake ID numbers
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:21.440]  and letting people steal and get fake returns, the illegals and all the rest of this
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:25.440]  and then even blaming citizens when those get attached to social security numbers
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:30.440]  and using the fraud the IRS engaged in as a way to go grab citizens bank accounts and things.
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:36.440]  And I mean, isn't making it easier for you to do your job as people begin to realize
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:40.440]  also that the ultra rich basically have exempted themselves as well?
[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:42.440]  I think there is a general awareness.
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:46.440]  And I'm not going to do an explicitly political thing.
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:49.440]  I like dissenters. I want more dissenters in America.
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:51.440]  I want more people that are going to rock the boat.
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:53.440]  So the Tea Party movement for me was a good thing
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:58.440]  because it showed that there could be a vibrant, robust political movement that wasn't party centric.
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:01.440]  And it doesn't matter whether I endorse what they believe or not.
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:05.440]  I like the Communist Workers. I like the Socialist Workers Party.
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:08.440]  I want people that are going to rock the boat and diselect Democrats and Republicans.
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:12.440]  And I think there's a mood in the country of deepening suspicion.
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:16.440]  I think Congress's popularity is down around and I'm not trying to dissent.
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:17.440]  Nine percent.
[01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:20.440]  It's really low. These are huge problems.
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:26.440]  I mean, once you lose the consent of the governed, you don't have a legitimate.
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:29.440]  You either go back to freedom or you go to North Korea.
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:31.440]  Absolutely. And that's where we're treading.
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:39.440]  But I believe that there's an increasing awakening in Americans regarding suspicion of the system,
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:41.440]  suspicion of statements by government.
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:48.440]  And I think that's positive. I have hope that more Americans will recognize that these are political problems.
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:52.440]  They're not necessarily legal ones. We don't need more legislation. We need less.
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:56.440]  And they need to get out there and start voting for people who are going to be truly independent.
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:59.440]  Well, I agree. Anybody that isn't in the cookie cutter mold is the way to go,
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:01.440]  just because it shakes up the system.
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:06.440]  This type of tyranny depends on a very smooth road to get away with the crimes.
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:07.440]  Let me bring this up.
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:11.440]  I also see this endless demonization of defense attorneys by media, by culture.
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:13.440]  Oh, they're the scum. They're the trash.
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:18.440]  From my experience, everybody deserves a good defense because government is the big danger.
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:20.440]  It's what killed more people in history than anything else.
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:25.440]  262 million in the last century, University of Hawaii did a study on democide.
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:31.440]  It's the big danger. And I have found that it's the political prosecutors,
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:34.440]  because there's good prosecutors, too, that will go to the wall to really get bad guys.
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:37.440]  But more and more, they just make deals and let them out.
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:43.440]  They want, I noticed, these prosecutors to hammer down good people that are just trying to live their lives.
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:46.440]  And for me, that's why I thank God for the defense attorneys.
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:53.440]  And I see this move to try to demonize defense attorneys, quote, getting bad guys off and letting it go to courts.
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:57.440]  Boy, if they do that, they've already neutered the grand jury.
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:00.440]  All we're left with is the cartridge box.
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:07.440]  Yeah, there's a lot of pandering going on from mainstream media about defense attorneys and evil defense attorneys.
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:11.440]  Seems to be a general program of defamation.
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:19.440]  The fact is, is that in the criminal defense realm, we're accountable in open court on the record more so than any of the civil attorneys are.
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:29.440]  They can play games with discovery and engage in litigation thuggery while we're always accountable on the record every 30 to 60 days for what we're doing and how we're doing it.
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:35.440]  My experience with the federal criminal defense bar is generally very positive. There's exceptions to that.
[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:38.440]  And I noticed you mentioned something, Alex, and I want to make a point about this.
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:48.440]  I know some really fine lawyers and fine men at U.S. Department of Justice Tax Division that I've been opposite in cases and local prosecutors
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:56.440]  who believe in what they're doing, who follow the rules, who don't violate the Constitution and laws of the United States respecting discovery to the defense.
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:43:07.440]  And really one of the things that really bothers me is all of those good men and women that are actually inside the system and are behaving with integrity, they get stroked with all of this massive misconduct.
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:15.440]  Well, that's the problem. The good people get out historically and then the criminals create little armies that then expand and then take over.
[01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:24.440]  Yes, when bad conduct is incentive rather than disincentive, it does drive out the ethical and the good and the men and women that want to do a public service.
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:32.440]  Because there's bad guys out there. We live in a dangerous world and I believe in law and order, even though I'm a libertarian, but I believe in law and order and I'm an objective moralist.
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:35.440]  That means law and order in the government first.
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:42.440]  Absolutely. The government is the great teacher. We learn by them if the government breaks the rules and gets away with impunity, what does that teach the citizens?
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:44.440]  Fish rots from the head.
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:50.440]  Some things roll downhill. Joe, you've been sitting here. This guy is amazing because I've seen him on TV before.
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:53.440]  I was sitting here looking like, I see this guy over television. He's impressive.
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:56.440]  We know why he's one of the best lawyers out there, I guess.
[01:43:56.440 --> 01:44:00.440]  How did you snag this guy? I guess you're a good guy too.
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:09.440]  Well, a month or two after I resigned from the IRS in 1999, really right around the same time that you first interviewed me, I get a call from this Bob Bernhoff from Milwaukee.
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:18.440]  I was like a deer caught in the headlights. I just wanted to make a living to support my family and leave the IRS behind, but people were calling me and wanting to get in contact with me.
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:29.440]  So that's when I first met Bob and had no idea the extent of the monster that was out there eating people up.
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:42.440]  And so it helped me to understand that, and then I became involved in it, and of course that's what led to the IRS really taking a dislike into me after I left because I was trying to get into that apparatus.
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:48.440]  Actually, I was not trying to get into the apparatus. People wanted me to come in and help the effort.
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:52.440]  I know you were drug into it. I had enough of the IRS, frankly.
[01:44:52.440 --> 01:45:00.440]  Remember at first, I was trying to get you back on the radio and stuff. You're like, I don't know right now. I might just be a CPA.
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:05.440]  You've been with me since the beginning, Alex. It was like March.
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:08.440]  Was it media by past you were first in? Yeah.
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:12.440]  Pat Shannon called me. That's right. We need to get Pat Shannon back on.
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:16.440]  He was on my radio show at Oklahoma City being a staged event.
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:25.440]  And he said, hey, I'm doing a story on this, you know, Treasury agent who investigated things and woke things up.
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:27.440]  You want to talk to him? And I said, OK, well, what's his number?
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:32.440]  And so I had gone out and interviewed you by the time his newspaper article or magazine article came out.
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:35.440]  Now that my memory gets refreshed, very exciting.
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:37.440]  Yeah, that was the tax issue for 1999.
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:40.440]  But you've now been through the fire, my friend.
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:47.440]  Well, thanks to, unfortunately, you don't you're not innocent until proven guilty. You need to find someone who can communicate your innocence.
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:55.440]  And I've just been blessed to have Mr. Bernhoft, Mr. Dijkstein, people that could communicate to the jury.
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:46:02.440]  No, the government really doesn't deserve that reputation for honesty and integrity that you think they have.
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:05.440]  Open up your mind and listen to the and look at the evidence.
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:08.440]  And that's what it took. And they acquitted me.
[01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:11.440]  Mr. Bernhoft, let me ask you a question on this front.
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:21.440]  Can you bring in, let's say you were doing a trial right now of another agent whistleblower, somebody like our guest here today.
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:28.440]  What could you bring in the fact that John Corzine was allowed to take billions of dollars and say he doesn't know where it went.
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:31.440]  And then now they admit he really did give it to another bank.
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:37.440]  I mean, could you bring up, hey, the big bankers, they get to keep billions, but he hasn't done anything and he's in trouble.
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:39.440]  Or is that not admissible?
[01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:41.440]  No, it's not. You know, that stuff doesn't come in now.
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:47.440]  There's an old spring court case that says that in closing argument, defense attorneys have to be given wings to sore.
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:49.440]  That's a great quote and it's true.
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:54.440]  But you can only bring in testimony and evidence that's going to be relevant to the charges to either that tend to disprove them.
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:59.440]  We can bring in impeachment evidence against government witnesses and we can certainly do that.
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:06.440]  Could you say this same government lets John Corzine take billions that disappear, but then they want to send him to jail when he hasn't taken a single sin?
[01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:09.440]  That can be done and that can be done in closing argument.
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:12.440]  Closing argument in Joe's case was very, very aggressive.
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:17.440]  And I mean, there was talk of jack-booted thugs and all sorts of interesting things.
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:18.440]  But no, you can do that.
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:20.440]  Testimony and evidence is one thing.
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:22.440]  A closing argument, you can draw parallels.
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:35.440]  You can put it to the jury that they've got a decision to make, that there's a double standard operating here and that the government is not behaving correctly towards your client, the defendant, who's in the block and stands to go to prison for 15, 16 years.
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:37.440]  Finishing up with Wesley Snipes, we've got a final segment.
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:39.440]  You guys can talk about whatever you'd like.
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:42.440]  I'm just in awe here hearing all of this.
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:48.440]  You had gotten to the point of how they were trying to try the case in the media and claiming he'd run from justice.
[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:51.440]  And I remember right away in the news, you guys went, this is propaganda.
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:53.440]  He was always intending to be here.
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:54.440]  Here he is.
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:55.440]  Right.
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:48:01.440]  We had to, whatever jury was finally in that box in the courtroom, and I'll tell you something, Judge William Terrell Hodges was an excellent judge.
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:10.440]  He's very hard-nosed, but I'll tell you what, he was a great evidence man, a great evidence judge, and he gave us a fair trial.
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:22.440]  Now, we fought for that fair trial through motion practice, and there's a certain thing that happens between advocates and federal judges who preside over particularly criminal trials, and you either obtain a respect for each other or you don't.
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:28.440]  But nobody gets any respect in the federal criminal process by not being aggressive and advocating zealously for your client.
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:41.440]  But in the Snipes case, you've got to get people to reject that propaganda, the misinformation, and we consistently said, look, 12 people are going to be in that jury box, and they're the ones who are going to hear actual testimony and evidence,
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:46.440]  not rumor, not innuendo, not propaganda, and those are the themes that we beat.
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:48.440]  We drilled those themes, and we had to.
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:56.440]  I did a walk and talk with Steve Barrett, great reporter from Orlando, a TV station down there, and we pummeled back against this propaganda.
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:49:06.440]  If you don't do that, those jurors are going to go in there with absolute misinformation in their minds, and they won't pay attention to the actual truth, the actual testimony and evidence, and then you're in trouble.
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:08.440]  And that's when you lose, and that's when you get convicted.
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:11.440]  And that's what would have happened down there, no question about it.
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:15.440]  The other thing is, you know, there was some discovery violations in the Snipes case.
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:17.440]  Those never became really public.
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:20.440]  We were really put to it by the prosecution team.
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:31.440]  They were revealing sometimes hundreds of pages of crucial documents the day after a particular trial day at 5.530, and we had to spend all night mastering that material so we could step up the next morning.
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:33.440]  It was a very, very difficult.
[01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:38.440]  They were hoping you'd be lazy and go back to the hotel and get a scotch, but you'd have to stay up all night.
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:40.440]  I tell you something, people have a misapprehension of how trials work.
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:42.440]  Once you go, we call it going into the trial hole.
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:46.440]  You go into the trial hole, you are off the grid, nobody, you don't even know.
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:47.440]  Give you're a winner.
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:48.440]  Absolutely.
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:53.440]  You've got to be prepared to get a couple of hours of sleep a night, take it seriously, and the work is extraordinary.
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:54.440]  Nobody sees that.
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:56.440]  That's all that work that goes behind the scenes.
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:57.440]  Joe can testify to that.
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:49:58.440]  How many nights?
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:00.440]  And the defendant better jump in and paddle.
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:01.440]  That's another thing.
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:10.440]  People think high-powered lawyers, you know, because the media actually just show up in a helicopter and win because they're, no, it's a bunch of, it's a real work.
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:11.440]  And some of it's extremely tedious.
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:15.440]  You know, you got a case, the Snipes case said over a million pages of discovery documents.
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:18.440]  You don't master those documents, you're going to lose.
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:21.440]  And that's the sort of paging through page after page after page.
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:23.440]  I mean, it's coming from.
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:28.440]  Yeah, I think I think you had what 58 boxes of discovery, a couple hundred thousand pages.
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:31.440]  So that's the sort of work that goes on behind the scenes.
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:38.440]  Trial success is a function of knowledge skill experience, but most importantly, mastery of the facts and the documents.
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:45.440]  If you're not willing to get dirty, roll up your sleeves with your team and your client like Joe who helped us through his discovery and drill down night.
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:47.440]  Well, that sounds like life in general.
[01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:50.440]  I mean, the system counts on us just being lazy, flying the surface.
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:51.440]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:53.440]  Final incredible segment with both our guests.
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:56.440]  I'm Alex Jones at FullWars.com.
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:05.440]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:10.440]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:12.440]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:20.440]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:24.440]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:28.440]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:35.440]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling power hub unit.
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:38.440]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:41.440]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:45.440]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar powered.
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:48.440]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:53.440]  In FullWars, listeners can get all the details at beattheblackouts.com.
[01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:55.440]  That's beattheblackouts.com.
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:52:02.440]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:05.440]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:14.440]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:19.440]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:31.440]  Now, you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:38.440]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:50.440]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from Carnivora.com. That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com. That's 1-866-836-8735.
[01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:56.440]  1-866-VENUSFLY or visit Carnivora.com. Protect your immune system. It's the only one you've got.
[01:52:56.440 --> 01:53:03.440]  After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've witnessed that a lot of illness can be linked to toxins and deficiencies combined.
[01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:10.440]  Improving your liver function and restoring your cell's ability to detoxify is essential to achieving radiant health.
[01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:34.440]  Listen to the real world results of Doug and his wife after taking One World Way.
[01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:57.440]  Call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325. 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com. That's OneWorldWHEY.com.
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:15.440]  There's a man going around taking names and he decides who to preach.
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:24.440]  We're ending this segment. This interview with a good song. Johnny Cash when the man comes around.
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:29.440]  There'll be a golden letter reaching down when the man comes around.
[01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:33.440]  Robert G. Bernhoft, probably the most...
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:37.440]  I mean, I can't think of anybody more preeminent than you when it comes to tax stuff. It's an honor to have you.
[01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:42.440]  And I can't think of somebody more honorable and preeminent when it comes to standing up for what's right.
[01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:55.440]  If you want to make a movie about your life, Joe Bannister, agentfortruth.com, agentfortruth.com, and again, Bernhoftlaw.com, B-E-R-N-H-O-F-T, law.com.
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:58.440]  We'll make sure both of these get linked up at infowars.com today.
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:06.440]  And if you're a radio listener on XM or on our 100 plus stations, by tomorrow we will have this up on YouTube for everybody,
[01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:08.440]  not just people watching at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:15.440]  So please get this video and get it out to everybody. That's a question I have for you, Robert.
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:17.440]  When does the man come to town?
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:21.440]  Because earlier you said we're treading water between North Korea and Liberty.
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:26.440]  We're going to choose one or the other. We're going to go back the other direction towards freedom, or we're going to go down the black hole.
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:33.440]  I mean, is the man going to come around? People are waking up, but the system is deciding to go with tyranny.
[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:37.440]  How do you see this with your considerable gravitas? How do you see this ending?
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:39.440]  I mean, what's your gut tell you?
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:44.440]  Wow. That's a heavy and loaded question. It's a great one.
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:56.440]  In my sphere, taking and putting aside from politics, if we don't stop, if we don't stem this epidemic of investigative and prosecutorial misconduct, we're in deep trouble.
[01:55:56.440 --> 01:56:05.440]  If our federal criminal process continues to be debauched by concealment and deceit, ethics violations, constitutional violations,
[01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:07.440]  it's over for the American Republic.
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:13.440]  I mean, we used to be sort of like the lighthouse on the hill, the example of great judicial systems.
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:19.440]  The whole world looked at the United States for our rules of evidence, of procedure, our process, our jury trials.
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:21.440]  We're losing that. We're becoming a laughing stock.
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:27.440]  Yeah, the great Americans and look at, they can't even get a fair trial for a former sitting United States Senator.
[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:29.440]  If we don't stem it, if we don't...
[01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:32.440]  Look at how they put that governor in jail in Alabama for no reason.
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:34.440]  That was admitted a fraud.
[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:39.440]  And the amazing thing about the former Senator Stevens prosecution, and there's thousands of these cases,
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:46.440]  that one gets all the publicity because he was a former U.S. Senator, and that shifted the balance of power in the United States Senate.
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:54.440]  But when you think about the Stevens case, that was prosecuted by the highest level of Department of Justice in Washington, the Office of Public Integrity, OPR.
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:57:02.440]  They couldn't get that right, and they want to say that line AUSA's, assistant U.S. attorneys, really understand the discovery rules.
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:11.440]  This needs to stop, and responsible prosecutors are for changing the rules, and disciplining prosecutors who do not follow the rules.
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:13.440]  Federal judges are getting sick and tired of this.
[01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:19.440]  What about when it comes out that we've got to do five minutes overdrive, you can do it, just to finish up this little addendum we have.
[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:22.440]  Kind of like that little extra reserve tank.
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:25.440]  How do they get away with this?
[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:29.440]  Because more and more, it's just coming out that the sky's the limit.
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:31.440]  I think they're doing it on purpose, basically.
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:34.440]  Well, the incentives are to win at all costs.
[01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:38.440]  And when you have an incentive to do that, people start breaking the rules.
[01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:44.440]  And then they start becoming rewarded for breaking the rules with conviction rates, promotions, and the things that they want.
[01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:49.440]  And then they recognize that they never get caught, and if they do get caught, they never get punished.
[01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:51.440]  Well, you saw the case in Williamson County.
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:56.440]  It's famous when they knew the guy really didn't do it, and they suppressed evidence, and they tried to keep the guy in prison.
[01:57:56.440 --> 01:58:00.440]  I mean, how does somebody try to put people who aren't even criminals?
[01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:05.440]  It's bad enough to set up an ex-con and send them away, but well, they shouldn't have been out.
[01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:07.440]  But now it's just set up totally innocent people?
[01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:13.440]  Yeah, you look at the prosecutor in the non-rape Duke LaCrosse case, for example, which, of course, no rape occurred.
[01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:15.440]  And that was all politics by the prosecutor.
[01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:22.440]  He's the only prosecutor that's been meaningfully disciplined for massive government misconduct in a very, very long time.
[01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:32.440]  So what happens is, even if the judge makes what's called a judicial referral of a prosecutor through the Bar Association, where that prosecutor has his license, the bars don't discipline the prosecutors.
[01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:37.440]  Taylor, back in one minute, in a five-minute overdrive, I've got to hear more about the LaCrosse case. Stay...
[01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:47.440]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:55.440]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:58:55.440 --> 01:59:03.440]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:08.440]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfowarsShop.com.
[01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:17.440]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use. You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetted water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:23.440]  The K-Tour Hand Crank Generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:28.440]  Strategic Relocation Third Edition by Joel Scousum, When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:38.440]  TheraSafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event. Hand Crank Shortwave AMFM Radios.
[01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:43.440]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at InfowarsShop.com and your purchase makes our Infowars possible.
[01:59:43.440 --> 01:59:50.440]  We're getting prepared. Are you InfowarsShop.com?
[01:59:50.440 --> 02:00:00.440]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:08.440]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:35.440]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:42.440]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we've got a very special presentation lined up for you in the next 60 minutes.
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:49.440]  And I'm presenting this not because I think it, but because I know it, and I've seen the dramatic results.
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:55.440]  And this is a major revolution against the globalist. Getting the fluoride out of the water is...
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:01:00.440]  I'll talk more about it later in the hour. Getting the GMO out of our lives that they're trying to assault us with.
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:06.440]  But the trace elements, minerals and vitamins, when you get it all together, it helps battle all the other stuff.
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:10.440]  But they want you sick. The medical system. Big pharma. They don't want you to know.
[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:17.440]  They know. They knew when the 20 sodium fluoride brain damaged you. They know MSG is toxic and causes neurological disorders.
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:22.440]  And they know that most of these illnesses are mineral and vitamin deficiencies.
[02:01:22.440 --> 02:01:31.440]  Well, joining us is pharmacist, compounding pharmacist, and more than 20 years, Ben Fuchs. He's a syndicated radio host here on the GCN Network, GCNLive.com.
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:36.440]  And he joins us. He's part of M4WarsTeam.com as well, and one of our advisors.
[02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:42.440]  We've got medical doctors, veterinarians, naturopaths, all advising us at M4WarsTeam.com.
[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:47.440]  You can see those videos posted there in Aaron's testimonial. But that's not why this is here today.
[02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:55.440]  That's not why we're covering this. We are going to engage in the public service of going through everything.
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:02:02.440]  Of going through all the vitamins, all the minerals, and then trace elements. Just bam, bam, bam, quickly.
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:08.440]  And then we can go back through other issues that the system doesn't want you to know.
[02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:14.440]  I had a family member who I noticed was only drinking Coca-Cola's about five years ago.
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:17.440]  They were old. They were pretty much going to die. And I just begged them.
[02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:28.440]  I said, if you will just start drinking water, your body, you're dehydrated because Coca-Cola and ice tea, you name it, is what is it called?
[02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:33.440]  A diuretic. It makes you urinate. You drink 20 ounces, you urinate 25 ounces.
[02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:36.440]  I said, you look like beef jerky. You got to drink water.
[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:40.440]  And they got mad at me and stuff and started drinking water and looked like a new person.
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:44.440]  Again, it's like simple. Your teeth will fall out and old wounds will open up.
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:47.440]  Your hair will fall out if you don't get vitamin C.
[02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:52.440]  We've got these food deserts out there, not just in poor areas, everywhere.
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:57.440]  Armistice Ben Fuchs joins us after this break. He is waiting in the wings right now.
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:01.440]  In fact, Armistice Ben, we've got two minutes until we've got a break. Tell us what's coming up today.
[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:04.440]  You've lined up an incredible presentation.
[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:08.440]  Well, I've got lots of stuff to talk about. Thank you for the intro, Alex. Thank you for the kind words.
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:10.440]  There's a lot of stuff in the news.
[02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:14.440]  I like the Consumer Reports article that came out a couple of weeks ago.
[02:03:14.440 --> 02:03:18.440]  Ten surprising dangers of vitamins and supplements. I'd love to be able to address that.
[02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:22.440]  There was a study that came out, I think it was last week, in the Journal of Nature Medicine.
[02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:27.440]  Chemotherapy can actually cause cancer. I thought that was pretty fascinating.
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:31.440]  Let's see. Staten drugs linked with development of cataracts.
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:33.440]  What else do you want to talk about here, Alex?
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:40.440]  There's the sugary drink ban in New York and the digital pill they want you to swallow
[02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:44.440]  that will give doctors the real-time scoop on what's happening inside your body.
[02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:49.440]  That could be kind of interesting. How about Dennis wanting us to drink more fluoride?
[02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:52.440]  They don't like bottled water because people aren't getting enough fluoride.
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:57.440]  We can talk about that, too. Lots of stuff here we can talk about. Diabetes, drugs raise the risk of bladder cancer.
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:00.440]  Staten drugs raise the risk of diabetes. There are tons of good stuff, Alex.
[02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:04.440]  I want to go over all those studies, but I heard your show a few days ago.
[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:09.440]  It was just a couple days ago. You were going over just this mineral.
[02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:13.440]  When you have this deficiency, does this. This vitamin deficiency, does that.
[02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:17.440]  This pancreatic problem caused by this. The system knows that.
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:24.440]  We talked a few days ago and you sent a whole big rundown of documents and articles and studies.
[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:32.440]  I want to go over just at first the different vitamins and then what those deficiencies do, different minerals,
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:40.440]  what is needed, what the really cool cofactors are, trace elements, things like that with pharmacist Ben Fuchs.
[02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:44.440]  Then we'll get into all those news items that you just mentioned straight ahead.
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:48.440]  I'm Alex Jones with Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, infowarsteam.com.

[02:07:55.440 --> 02:08:20.440]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:31.440]  Well, he's back by popular demand. Thank you so much for joining us. I'm Alex Jones on this Wednesday, 15th day of August, 2012 edition.
[02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:41.440]  Compounding pharmacist Ben Fuchs will be with us for the rest of the hour, syndicated radio host, and an advisor to InfoWarsTeam.com.
[02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:47.440]  And we're going to get later into the fact they want to put statin drugs in the water. They want to put more fluoride in food for kids,
[02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:54.440]  even though the government admits it's killing them. They're saying, don't eat yolk and eggs. It's more dangerous than smoking.
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:09:04.440]  Now, they want to tax that. Just all of this incredible nanny state, meanwhile, big pharma, big medical, notes that most illnesses in their own documents,
[02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:15.440]  and we have them right here. We're going to go over them today, that their own documents show that they know that most diseases are vitamin, mineral, trace element, and cofactor deficiencies.
[02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:21.440]  They know why pancreatic cancer is way up. They know why type 2 diabetes is way up. They know why cancer is way up.
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:29.440]  They knew the 20 sodium fluoride and other forms of fluoride put in the water caused a sevenfold increase in bone cancer alone and reduced IQ.
[02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:36.440]  Harvard came out last week in a decades plus long study and said, combining a whole bunch of other studies and said, yeah, this is happening.
[02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:45.440]  They know. They know it all. They know. The average doctor does it. They just follow what they're told. But this is a real revolution against tyranny.
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:55.440]  Just like the British, and I've told this story many times, 300 plus years ago, their Academy of Sciences, their Royal Academy, discovered whatever was in green vegetables and fruits,
[02:09:55.440 --> 02:10:03.440]  vitamin C later discovered, but they knew if you had that, your old wounds didn't open up, you stayed healthy, your teeth didn't fall out with scurvy.
[02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:10.440]  So all the other navies, the French, the Spanish, they made fun of them and called them limies.
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:22.440]  And they made fun of Germans because they ate kraut. Oh, you eat kraut. Oh, you eat limes. Limies. Brits are called limies, but their navy was able to take over because of vitamin C.
[02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:29.440]  The system knows this. So they want you to have adulterated food with all these toxic additives.
[02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:37.440]  Hundreds of things you eat in different fast foods places. Hundreds of fried confections have on record silicone in them.
[02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:51.440]  They can call it an additive and have you eat it. So here is Pharmacist Ben Fuchs to run through vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and Kiko factors that when you don't have them, they know it's causing the debilitating disorders and diseases.
[02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:53.440]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, great to have you here today.
[02:10:53.440 --> 02:10:55.440]  Thank you, Alex. Appreciate it.
[02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:57.440]  You've got the floor. Start breaking it down.
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:05.440]  Yeah, well, it's interesting that you brought up vitamin C first because truly vitamin C is the king of vitamin. It's so fundamental to health.
[02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:11.440]  It's pretty much impossible to think of a disease state or a breakdown state that vitamin C doesn't improve.
[02:11:11.440 --> 02:11:14.440]  The first thing that comes to mind with vitamin C deficiency is what you said, scurvy.
[02:11:14.440 --> 02:11:20.440]  But what's really important to understand about scurvy is the fact that you can have subclinical scurvy.
[02:11:20.440 --> 02:11:26.440]  By the time scurvy hits, you're in big trouble. But scurvy doesn't all of a sudden happen. Scurvy builds up.
[02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:30.440]  Scurvy is basically a disease where the body destroys itself.
[02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:33.440]  The body's main connective tissue protein is called collagen.
[02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:37.440]  Without vitamin C, you cannot make collagen. Period.
[02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:43.440]  Collagen is not only the most fundamental structural protein in the body, it's the most fundamental protein in the body.
[02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:50.440]  Without vitamin C, you can't make collagen. That means, number one, your blood vessels will not be strong.
[02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:52.440]  Ultimately, your blood vessels will break down.
[02:11:52.440 --> 02:11:57.440]  I think it's ironic how people are so focused on cholesterol and they're not focused on vitamin C,
[02:11:57.440 --> 02:12:07.440]  considering one of the ways the body patches up weak blood vessels is by depositing cholesterol plaques in those blood vessels.
[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:14.440]  Dr. Matthias Rath has written extensively about this in a really neat book called Why Animals Don't Get Heart Attacks.
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:20.440]  He talks about how animals make their own vitamin C and animals don't get heart attacks because they make their own vitamin C
[02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:22.440]  and their blood vessels are strong.
[02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:28.440]  One has to wonder when you see the link between vitamin C and the strength of the blood vessels,
[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:33.440]  how much of heart disease is simply a vitamin C deficiency disease.
[02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:38.440]  Not only that, but vitamin C is key, a fundamental player in the immune system.
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:43.440]  So if you're dealing with frequent colds, if you're getting cold sores...
[02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:53.440]  Hold your horses there, pharmacist Ben Fuchs, or hold your rats, because the British manuals going back up to 300 years ago said
[02:12:53.440 --> 02:12:59.440]  if you can't find fresh, green vegetables or fruits, eat rats.
[02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:09.440]  They had discovered that whatever was in the fruit was in the intestines of ship rats and that they would then gobble the guts of rats raw.
[02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:14.440]  Again, what you just said, most mammals produce it. Why don't we produce our own vitamin C?
[02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:18.440]  Nobody really knows why, but they think it has something to do with the fact that we were eating fruits and vegetables.
[02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:24.440]  It turns out that primes, certain gorillas, certain forms of gorillas, human beings, and guinea pigs of all critters
[02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:30.440]  are the only animals that don't make vitamin C. Squirrels make vitamin C, horses make vitamin C, goats make vitamin C,
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:36.440]  and what's really fascinating, Alex, is when an animal is under stress, it makes more vitamin C.
[02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:43.440]  Your body's key stress gland, key stress-handling structure, the adrenal glands, are very high in vitamin C,
[02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:49.440]  and when we're under stress of any kind, whether that's emotional stress, psychological stress, and certainly physical stress,
[02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:56.440]  you need more vitamin C, and this gets us to the whole topic of recommended daily allowances, the RDAs,
[02:13:56.440 --> 02:14:00.440]  which I call the Ridiculous Deficiency Allowance, the RDA of vitamin C.
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:07.440]  The Ridiculous Deficiency Allowance of vitamin C, according to the government, is 60 milligrams of vitamin C.
[02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:11.440]  A billy goat will make 100 times that much vitamin C when it's under stress,
[02:14:11.440 --> 02:14:17.440]  and it makes much more than the recommended daily allowance of vitamin C, even on a daily basis.
[02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:25.440]  This whole idea of vitamins being used simply to treat deficiency diseases is what gives rise to the recommended daily allowance
[02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:30.440]  that allows people to think, well, I'll just take this multiple vitamin with the RDAs and I'll be fine,
[02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:33.440]  or I'd better not take more than the RDAs or I'll be in big trouble.
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:39.440]  Nothing speaks to this fallacy more than the idea that you only need 55 or 60 milligrams of vitamin C.
[02:14:39.440 --> 02:14:43.440]  So your points well taken, animals are making their own vitamin C.
[02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:47.440]  We're not. That means you've got to be supplementing.
[02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:49.440]  It's going to be very difficult to get your vitamin C out of food,
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:55.440]  and in fact, Alice, it's very difficult to get all of the vitamins you need from food anyway.
[02:14:55.440 --> 02:15:01.440]  For example, with vitamin E, the recommended daily allowance of vitamin E is 14 international units.
[02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:08.440]  Every study that's ever been done on the protective benefits of vitamin E show that you need 400 international units of vitamin E,
[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:13.440]  and even the most vitamin E dense foods are only going to give you about 40 international units.
[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:19.440]  So with vitamin E, with vitamin C, with the B complex, you're not going to be able to get what you need from food
[02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:22.440]  even under the best of circumstances.
[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:25.440]  And this is why it's so, so important to supplement.
[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:32.440]  If you're healthy and if you're sick, it is unspeakably important to get yourself on a good nutritional supplement program.
[02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:36.440]  So vitamin C for the connective tissue in the body.
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:41.440]  By the way, bones, a lot of people are under the impression that all you need to do is take calcium for your bones.
[02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:45.440]  Well, as it turns out, your bones too are made of collagen,
[02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:53.440]  and vitamin C is way more important for the integrity of your bones via this collagen connection than calcium is.
[02:15:53.440 --> 02:16:00.440]  In fact, many people call osteoporosis the disease of bone breakdown of weak bones, scurvy of the bones.
[02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:05.440]  If you have bleeding gums, if you have nosebleeds, if you have chronic bruising,
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:13.440]  if you have any kind of heart disease issues, not to mention osteoporosis and high blood pressure and joint issues and arthritis,
[02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:16.440]  you want to make sure that you're getting enough vitamin C.
[02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:22.440]  For people who are interested in skin health, vitamin C can be amazingly helpful for protecting your skin from the sun.
[02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:30.440]  In fact, as it turns out, using nutritional supplements is way more important for protecting your skin from the sun
[02:16:30.440 --> 02:16:37.440]  than any toxic sunscreen you could ever put on, and vitamin C is the king of sun protection vitamins.
[02:16:37.440 --> 02:16:41.440]  For folks who are out there in the sun, get some vitamin C in your body.
[02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:45.440]  You can even use vitamin C topically as a cream, and it's got wonderful benefits that way too.
[02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:52.440]  Oh no, I've been using this vitamin C facial cream my wife's got. It's awesome, and I've really seen it make my skin a lot healthier.
[02:16:52.440 --> 02:17:01.440]  And obviously, Beyond Tangy Tangerine or Polymers Plus, things like that available at InfoWarsTeam.com,
[02:17:01.440 --> 02:17:04.440]  that would obviously be some of the best sources of vitamin C.
[02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:09.440]  Heck yes, you're getting a thousand milligrams of vitamin C per two scoops of the Beyond Tangy Tangerine.
[02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:13.440]  Here's the thing about the BTT, which you mentioned, the Beyond Tangy Tangerine and the Polymers.
[02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:19.440]  They're liquid, and the rate limiting step and how much value you're going to get out of nutritional supplementation.
[02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:26.440]  If you understand how important nutritional supplementation is, and you don't have to do much reading to understand how important it is,
[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:32.440]  then it becomes vital to recognize it's not so much what you're taking in, but it's what you're absorbing.
[02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:39.440]  And if you're one of the 80 million or more Americans who are dealing with digestive issues, bile issues, gallbladder issues, gastritis, pancreatitis,
[02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:43.440]  you can take supplements, but you may not be getting the value of them.
[02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:50.440]  You need those really big dosages from what I've read and studied from yourself and others to really have the full effect,
[02:17:50.440 --> 02:17:57.440]  but you'd have to drink two or three containers of orange juice to get the same vitamin C in a Beyond Tangy Tangerine scoop,
[02:17:57.440 --> 02:18:03.440]  and then you'd be getting all of that bad overload of fruit toast that attacks the liver and everything else.
[02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:05.440]  Not to mention the pesticides as well.
[02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:12.440]  Now, orange juice has got a very small amount of vitamin C to get about 30 or 40 milligrams of vitamin C in a glass of orange juice,
[02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:15.440]  and then, of course, you're exposing yourself to all that sugar and all those pesticides.
[02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:20.440]  One of the neat things about the Beyond Tangy Tangerine is the liquid format.
[02:18:20.440 --> 02:18:25.440]  And so if you're dealing with digestive distress, but you understand you want to get on a nutritional supplement program,
[02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:29.440]  you understand how important it is, please take a shot at liquid nutrition.
[02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:33.440]  Please take a shot at products like the Beyond Tangy Tangerine that will allow you to drink.
[02:18:33.440 --> 02:18:38.440]  Well, exactly. But expanding on that, expanding on that, it's got all the other vitamins, minerals, trace elements,
[02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:43.440]  two factors together to supercharge it. And I want to talk about how things work together when we come back.
[02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:49.440]  But separately, folks, green leafy vegetables, berries, there's a lot of great ways to get vitamin C as well.
[02:18:49.440 --> 02:18:56.440]  It's just the products at InfoWarsTeam.com. They're discounted or what I'm using and what Aaron Dyke's lost 92 pounds with,
[02:18:56.440 --> 02:18:59.440]  even though it's not advertised as a weight loss product.
[02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:05.440]  The food is so devoid of nutrients now because of the plate out soils, you're eating and eating and eating empty calories,
[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:08.440]  trying to simply get the vitamins and minerals you need.
[02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:14.440]  And so that's why when you finally get the vitamins and minerals you need, you don't have those cravings as bad anymore
[02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:17.440]  and you can lose the weight. But see, we've only covered one vitamin.
[02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:22.440]  Vitamin C, the King Daddy that I started with, that you started with, we didn't plan to do that.
[02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:28.440]  That was just, we're on the same page, Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, one of the top compounding pharmacists out there in the country.
[02:19:28.440 --> 02:19:35.440]  Syndicate a talk show host, when we come back, let's race through the other vitamins, then the minerals, then trace elements
[02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:38.440]  and key cofactors because I want to know this.
[02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:41.440]  I was listening to your show a few days ago and just riveted and I said, get me Ben Fuchs.
[02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:47.440]  And we talked off air, we got this whole file together, we just spent 20 minutes on one vitamin.
[02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:53.440]  Get your notepads ready because we're going to run down the line here with Info.
[02:19:53.440 --> 02:19:55.440]  Big Brother doesn't want you to know.
[02:19:55.440 --> 02:20:01.440]  The worst drought in 50 years continues and the first 6 months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:20:01.440 --> 02:20:04.440]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:20:04.440 --> 02:20:10.440]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:20:10.440 --> 02:20:15.440]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[02:20:15.440 --> 02:20:22.440]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods, or meat foods, direct now.
[02:20:22.440 --> 02:20:26.440]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eat foods will have to raise prices too.
[02:20:26.440 --> 02:20:28.440]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:20:28.440 --> 02:20:32.440]  I recently increased my supply from Eat Foods Direct because we have all known this was coming.
[02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:35.440]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.

[02:21:58.440 --> 02:22:02.440]  Did you know that a solar storm in 1989 caused an enormous blackout in Quebec?
[02:22:02.440 --> 02:22:04.440]  Here's the really bad news.
[02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:08.440]  Experts are predicting that solar storms will get really severe over the next year
[02:22:08.440 --> 02:22:11.440]  and our electric grid is extremely vulnerable.
[02:22:11.440 --> 02:22:16.440]  In fact, the Wall Street Journal reported that we could soon face blackouts last weeks or months,
[02:22:16.440 --> 02:22:20.440]  leaving major parts of the USA temporarily uninhabitable.
[02:22:20.440 --> 02:22:22.440]  Are you prepared for this coming crisis?

[02:22:54.440 --> 02:22:59.440]  Alex Jones here with a message that could revolutionize health in this country.
[02:22:59.440 --> 02:23:05.440]  Going back about a year and a half ago, I began to learn about the incredible health effects of young Jevity products.
[02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:09.440]  Erin Dykes lost 92 pounds.
[02:23:09.440 --> 02:23:11.440]  We're going to show you some before and afters.
[02:23:11.440 --> 02:23:14.440]  Erin, break down what happened, your story.
[02:23:14.440 --> 02:23:19.440]  I've worked really hard with diet and exercise to try to lose weight, but I just didn't get the results.
[02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:20.440]  It just didn't happen.
[02:23:20.440 --> 02:23:23.440]  Then I saw what you were doing with infowarsteam.com.
[02:23:23.440 --> 02:23:27.440]  I wasn't even trying to lose weight, but I got it because I wanted to feel better energy.
[02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:32.440]  I wanted that nutrition, didn't even understand how that could kickstart my own weight loss goals.
[02:23:32.440 --> 02:23:34.440]  But the products did that for me.
[02:23:34.440 --> 02:23:40.440]  I found myself suddenly losing weight, more energetic, wanting to exercise, wanting to eat the right foods.
[02:23:40.440 --> 02:23:42.440]  And they don't even advertise it as weight loss.
[02:23:42.440 --> 02:23:46.440]  I want to challenge our radio listeners to go to infowarsteam.com.
[02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:52.440]  Sign up as a distributor and get wholesale pricing discounts at infowarsteam.com.
[02:23:52.440 --> 02:24:07.440]  Music
[02:24:07.440 --> 02:24:12.440]  So, when old folks go in with Alzheimer's and big rotholes in their arms
[02:24:12.440 --> 02:24:16.440]  where their skin is falling apart and their teeth have all fallen out,
[02:24:16.440 --> 02:24:21.440]  the doctors don't say, hey, you have scurvy.
[02:24:21.440 --> 02:24:25.440]  They just send them home to rot and die.
[02:24:25.440 --> 02:24:31.440]  Because big pharma doesn't make money if they say, hey, go eat some blueberries.
[02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:36.440]  Or go take naturally derived rosehemp vitamin C or something.
[02:24:36.440 --> 02:24:37.440]  It doesn't matter.
[02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:39.440]  Linus Pauling won two Nobel Prizes.
[02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:42.440]  One of them for discovering how powerful.
[02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:44.440]  The vitamin C is magic.
[02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:47.440]  This is a short six-minute segment, long segment coming up.
[02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:53.440]  Okay, pharmacist Ben Fuchs, we're going to post this video of this interview at infowarsteam.com.
[02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:56.440]  If anybody's listening on the radio and wants to see the video of it
[02:24:56.440 --> 02:24:58.440]  and some of the documents we're going to be going over,
[02:24:58.440 --> 02:25:02.440]  it'll be posted by tomorrow at infowarsteam.com.
[02:25:02.440 --> 02:25:03.440]  Continue.
[02:25:03.440 --> 02:25:05.440]  Let's race through the other vitamins right now
[02:25:05.440 --> 02:25:08.440]  and what they're directly linked to if you don't have them.
[02:25:08.440 --> 02:25:12.440]  Vitamin E, brain health, dry skin, these are deficiencies in vitamin E.
[02:25:12.440 --> 02:25:15.440]  Vitamin E deficiencies are associated with problems with thinking, with brain problems,
[02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:19.440]  with dementias, with macular degeneration, with eye disease, with impotence,
[02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:20.440]  with infertility.
[02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:23.440]  By the way, there's an infertility epidemic in this country.
[02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:26.440]  Vitamin E is known as the fertility vitamin.
[02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:28.440]  The technical name for vitamin E is to cough or all,
[02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:30.440]  which means to bear children.
[02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:33.440]  Deficiencies in vitamin E are associated with prostate disease.
[02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:34.440]  Another epidemic.
[02:25:34.440 --> 02:25:38.440]  Deficiencies in vitamin E can cause skin problems like hyperpigmentation,
[02:25:38.440 --> 02:25:40.440]  dark spots, another seeming epidemic.
[02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:43.440]  Then there's the B complex, which is a series of vitamins
[02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:45.440]  that are found in nature.
[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:47.440]  The B complex are the energy vitamins if you're feeling sluggish,
[02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:50.440]  or if you're feeling lethargic, if you have brain fog.
[02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:53.440]  All of these are associated with B complex deficiencies.
[02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:56.440]  The more sugar you eat, the more deficient you're going to be.
[02:25:56.440 --> 02:26:00.440]  In key B vitamins, there's a B vitamin that is so fundamental for brain health.
[02:26:00.440 --> 02:26:05.440]  The doctor, Abram Hoffer, wrote a book called Orthomolecular Psychiatry
[02:26:05.440 --> 02:26:08.440]  talking about treating schizophrenia successfully using nothing more...
[02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:09.440]  That's B12.
[02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:10.440]  That's B3.
[02:26:10.440 --> 02:26:12.440]  Vitamin B12 is on three.
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:14.440]  B12 is unspeakably important.
[02:26:14.440 --> 02:26:17.440]  If you have any digestive issues, you're going to be deficient in B12.
[02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:21.440]  B12 is critical for the nervous system and for the blood system,
[02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:25.440]  and many people are deficient in B12 and don't notice it.
[02:26:25.440 --> 02:26:28.440]  If you have any gastritis or low stomach acid issues,
[02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:30.440]  you're going to have problems absorbing B12.
[02:26:30.440 --> 02:26:34.440]  Vitamin B3, by the way, is wonderful for treating social anxiety disorder,
[02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:40.440]  or jitteriness, or just generalized anxiety deficiencies in vitamin B3
[02:26:40.440 --> 02:26:44.440]  or associated with brain fog, learning disabilities, cholesterol.
[02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:48.440]  It's a more powerful cholesterol-lowering drug than any statin drug.
[02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:51.440]  Simply vitamin B3 niacin.
[02:26:51.440 --> 02:26:54.440]  You can read all about that all over the internet
[02:26:54.440 --> 02:26:58.440]  of niacin for lowering cholesterol, if you so desire to lower cholesterol.
[02:26:58.440 --> 02:27:02.440]  Vitamin D. Everybody's heard about vitamin D these days.
[02:27:02.440 --> 02:27:04.440]  Vitamin D is an immune-boosting vitamin.
[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:07.440]  Deficiencies are associated with diabetes, with poor sugar control,
[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:11.440]  with high blood pressure, with multiple sclerosis, with cardiovascular disease.
[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:15.440]  This is like a who's who of all the diseases that we're dealing with,
[02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:18.440]  and they're all associated with nutritional deficiencies.
[02:27:18.440 --> 02:27:22.440]  Vitamin K deficiencies associated with bruising the formation of stones.
[02:27:22.440 --> 02:27:26.440]  And by the way, you're not just saying this right now.
[02:27:26.440 --> 02:27:28.440]  This is admitted, and the people they put on CUMIDIN,
[02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:32.440]  they tell them not to eat green vegetables, which has the vitamin K,
[02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:36.440]  and then the rot holes are all in their skin, their skin's falling off.
[02:27:36.440 --> 02:27:39.440]  They're literally being murdered. This is not your opinion.
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:41.440]  They've known this for hundreds of years. Please continue.
[02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:44.440]  So vitamin K, it's absolutely correct, by the way,
[02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:47.440]  when they put you on CUMIDIN, they tell you not to eat any vitamin K containing foods,
[02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:51.440]  including broccoli and cauliflower, and anything that's got vitamin K in it.
[02:27:51.440 --> 02:27:55.440]  Same with vitamin E, by the way. After surgery, and even before surgery,
[02:27:55.440 --> 02:28:00.440]  vitamin E is such an effective blood thinner that they'll tell you not to take vitamin E.
[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:02.440]  Why don't they give you vitamin E instead of the CUMIDIN?
[02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:06.440]  Instead of the medications, that's a whole other question.
[02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:10.440]  Anyway, vitamin A is associated, deficiencies associated with acne.
[02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:12.440]  I deal with acne all the time.
[02:28:12.440 --> 02:28:16.440]  And if you want to induce acne in a patient or in a laboratory animal,
[02:28:16.440 --> 02:28:20.440]  you've got to do nothing more than remove the vitamin A out of the diet.
[02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:23.440]  Vitamin A deficiencies are associated with zinc deficiencies,
[02:28:23.440 --> 02:28:25.440]  which is extremely common.
[02:28:25.440 --> 02:28:29.440]  Vitamin A deficiencies can be linked to psoriasis, to eczema, to dry skin,
[02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:34.440]  to dry lips, to cardiovascular disease, depressions in the immune system,
[02:28:34.440 --> 02:28:39.440]  digestive distress, leaky gut syndrome, osteoporosis, deficiencies in zinc.
[02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:43.440]  My favorite mineral associated with acne, eczema, poor wound repair,
[02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:46.440]  zinc is absolutely vital for growing protein for children.
[02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:51.440]  I know multiple women who are pretty young, who have the epidemic of their hair falling out,
[02:28:51.440 --> 02:28:54.440]  because they're on diets, all this stuff, that their hair came back
[02:28:54.440 --> 02:28:57.440]  when they were on Beyond Tangy Tangerine for six months.
[02:28:57.440 --> 02:29:02.440]  I mean, the hair came back. I watched it.
[02:29:02.440 --> 02:29:05.440]  That's not surprising to me. You're getting a healthy dose of nutrients,
[02:29:05.440 --> 02:29:08.440]  and you're getting them in liquid format, easy to absorb fashion.
[02:29:08.440 --> 02:29:12.440]  That's a neat thing, by the way, about the Beyond Tangy Tangerine and liquid nutrition,
[02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:16.440]  is you notice results quickly. This isn't like a 30-day kind of thing.
[02:29:16.440 --> 02:29:20.440]  You notice results in days, sometimes in doses, sometimes in one or two doses.
[02:29:20.440 --> 02:29:23.440]  And the great thing about the human body and deficiency states
[02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:28.440]  is the more deficient you are, the faster your body responds.
[02:29:28.440 --> 02:29:31.440]  The more weight you need to lose, the faster you'll lose the weight.
[02:29:31.440 --> 02:29:35.440]  The more nutritionally deficient you are, the faster your body will absorb the nutrients.
[02:29:35.440 --> 02:29:40.440]  That means the sicker you are, the people that are really skinny, gain weight on it.
[02:29:40.440 --> 02:29:55.440]  Your body knows what to do with these tools. We'll be back with the rest of vitamins.
[02:30:10.440 --> 02:30:15.440]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[02:30:15.440 --> 02:30:19.440]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices
[02:30:19.440 --> 02:30:22.440]  by getting your own supply of foods from Eat Foods Direct now.
[02:30:22.440 --> 02:30:26.440]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, Eat Foods will have to raise prices too.
[02:30:26.440 --> 02:30:28.440]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:30:28.440 --> 02:30:32.440]  I recently increased my supply from Eat Foods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[02:30:32.440 --> 02:30:35.440]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:30:35.440 --> 02:30:39.440]  The fact is you can eat it any time to save money today, and because it stores for 25 years,
[02:30:39.440 --> 02:30:42.440]  you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.

[02:30:55.440 --> 02:30:58.440]  Sick of the globalist eugenesis control freaks adding poison to your water

[02:31:17.440 --> 02:31:19.440]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:23.440]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[02:31:23.440 --> 02:31:26.440]  Easy to set up and use. Doesn't require electricity.
[02:31:26.440 --> 02:31:29.440]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:31:29.440 --> 02:31:32.440]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:31:32.440 --> 02:31:36.440]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:31:36.440 --> 02:31:39.440]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:31:39.440 --> 02:31:41.440]  It's what my family uses.
[02:31:41.440 --> 02:31:44.440]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[02:31:44.440 --> 02:31:50.440]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at infowars.com.

[02:31:55.440 --> 02:31:58.440]  Supernatural silver is not an ionic or colloidal silver.
[02:31:58.440 --> 02:32:04.440]  It is a nano-catalytic silver cell technology with superior benefits to the colloidal silvers of yesterday.
[02:32:04.440 --> 02:32:08.440]  This new molecular structure is permanently bonded to water.

[02:33:44.440 --> 02:33:48.440]  We will not stand down. We will not back down.
[02:33:48.440 --> 02:33:50.440]  We will not surrender.
[02:33:53.440 --> 02:33:56.440]  Hear the cry of war.
[02:33:57.440 --> 02:34:00.440]  Louder than before.
[02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:04.440]  With a sort of proof we control the land.
[02:34:08.440 --> 02:34:12.440]  Yeah, we're gonna drag the Phantom Lord of the New World Order out.
[02:34:12.440 --> 02:34:18.440]  By a shirt tail, and God's help throw him right into the pit when the archangel ties him up and chains.
[02:34:20.440 --> 02:34:22.440]  Listen to this part right here.
[02:34:26.440 --> 02:34:31.440]  Poetry right there. Alright, let's go back to Ben Fuchs. It's hard to turn that off.
[02:34:34.440 --> 02:34:39.440]  Let me tell you something, folks. I promote what I believe in, and I'm gonna do a plug right here for the Ungevity products.
[02:34:39.440 --> 02:34:42.440]  Discount it if you sign up for 10 bucks like Costco.
[02:34:42.440 --> 02:34:46.440]  You get discounts at infowarsteam.com and your purchase supports us.
[02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:51.440]  They've got the just out with my ugly face on the cover.
[02:34:51.440 --> 02:34:55.440]  Polymers plus with the current berries from New Zealand.
[02:34:55.440 --> 02:35:03.440]  A little added boost of antioxidants on top of all the bees and the minerals and the bee pollen and all the stuff that's in there.
[02:35:03.440 --> 02:35:05.440]  The beyond tangy tangerine, everything.
[02:35:05.440 --> 02:35:11.440]  infowarsteam.com. 877-551-1301.
[02:35:11.440 --> 02:35:14.440]  877-551-1301.
[02:35:14.440 --> 02:35:19.440]  If you want to call and be a distributor or got any questions or want to talk to some of the folks at the InfoWars team,
[02:35:19.440 --> 02:35:23.440]  a lot of people that end up being distributors end up working for the crew here.
[02:35:23.440 --> 02:35:27.440]  This stuff is taken in the country by storm through our radio show.
[02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:34.440]  I know that it's boosted the overall longevity cells period outside of what I'm doing, about 35% the last year.
[02:35:34.440 --> 02:35:38.440]  Because people buy what really works.
[02:35:38.440 --> 02:35:43.440]  Again, I've been promoting this two years, knew it was good, didn't really, it stuck my toe in though.
[02:35:43.440 --> 02:35:46.440]  It was just another sponsorship of something I believed in, but I wasn't.
[02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:51.440]  When I saw it with Erin and then my family and my mother, who's a triathlete and everybody else,
[02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:55.440]  and then women I know whose hair was falling out and the hair came back in.
[02:35:55.440 --> 02:35:58.440]  I mean, because it wasn't a hormonal issue, it was a nutrient thing.
[02:35:58.440 --> 02:36:03.440]  Nails growing faster, I don't want to get into personal stuff,
[02:36:03.440 --> 02:36:08.440]  I've never had a really oily skin, but I get some blackheads and stuff, just almost gone.
[02:36:08.440 --> 02:36:11.440]  I mean, really dramatic effects.
[02:36:11.440 --> 02:36:15.440]  The only problem is I feel like I'm 18 again and I'm being super aggressive.
[02:36:15.440 --> 02:36:19.440]  I mean, super aggressive where I'm just ready to get in fights almost instantly.
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:21.440]  But that's, most people, it doesn't do that.
[02:36:21.440 --> 02:36:23.440]  Okay, that's just how I am, okay?
[02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:25.440]  I've always been aggressive.
[02:36:25.440 --> 02:36:30.440]  And going back to Ben Fuchs, I know a lot of these having this mix also boosted my testosterone.
[02:36:30.440 --> 02:36:34.440]  Naturally, I'm not going to get into how I know that's happened.
[02:36:34.440 --> 02:36:38.440]  But men know when you've got a boosted testosterone with that, how you know that.
[02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:40.440]  Now, the point is, this is real.
[02:36:40.440 --> 02:36:42.440]  Now, can you do this through other products?
[02:36:42.440 --> 02:36:43.440]  Yeah, it'll cost you more.
[02:36:43.440 --> 02:36:44.440]  We've even looked at it.
[02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:48.440]  It costs a lot more to try to get everything you get in just a few young Jebedy products.
[02:36:48.440 --> 02:36:54.440]  The Alex pack with the Osteo FX, the Essential Fatty Acids, the Beyond Tanging Tangerine,
[02:36:54.440 --> 02:36:56.440]  and the Polymers Plus, you do that, you get everything.
[02:36:56.440 --> 02:36:59.440]  They've got a lot of other little specialty cofactors and things.
[02:36:59.440 --> 02:37:00.440]  And I'm on the stop plugging now.
[02:37:00.440 --> 02:37:02.440]  That's not why Ben Fuchs is on.
[02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:03.440]  We can do two hours on this.
[02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:11.440]  You can get clean water, you can get the basic vitamins, basic minerals, huge dosages of vitamin C,
[02:37:11.440 --> 02:37:13.440]  and just see what it does for you.
[02:37:13.440 --> 02:37:14.440]  Try some other company.
[02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:15.440]  Just please.
[02:37:15.440 --> 02:37:19.440]  In fact, Ben, before we get back to the minerals and vitamins, we've covered about 10% of them.
[02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:20.440]  We've got a race now.
[02:37:20.440 --> 02:37:23.440]  Because I haven't heard you talk about this specifically.
[02:37:23.440 --> 02:37:29.440]  I've found that if I drink more clean water as well, that that's essential.
[02:37:29.440 --> 02:37:33.440]  And I've seen that help family before I even woke up to this other stuff.
[02:37:33.440 --> 02:37:38.440]  I had great uncles and people who I'd sit there watching drinking coffee and tea all day.
[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:40.440]  And I said, do you drink water?
[02:37:40.440 --> 02:37:41.440]  And they can hardly get out of their chair.
[02:37:41.440 --> 02:37:42.440]  They're like, no.
[02:37:42.440 --> 02:37:43.440]  And I go, you're all shriveled up.
[02:37:43.440 --> 02:37:44.440]  You're dehydrated.
[02:37:44.440 --> 02:37:45.440]  Do you know that's a diuretic?
[02:37:45.440 --> 02:37:47.440]  I don't want to hear it.
[02:37:47.440 --> 02:37:50.440]  I'm like, hey, listen, I brought them literature.
[02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:53.440]  I said, if you want to feel better, do this.
[02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:55.440]  And it was like a new person just off water.
[02:37:55.440 --> 02:37:57.440]  So we're not selling water, by the way.
[02:37:57.440 --> 02:37:58.440]  We think you should purify it.
[02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:01.440]  I mean, but there's a lot of stuff hidden in plain view.
[02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:02.440]  The system knows this.
[02:38:02.440 --> 02:38:03.440]  Pharmacy spin fuchs.
[02:38:03.440 --> 02:38:05.440]  How important is water?
[02:38:05.440 --> 02:38:06.440]  Please.
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:08.440]  More water means more blood.
[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:11.440]  More blood means more oxygen and more nutrition.
[02:38:11.440 --> 02:38:14.440]  And you don't need to know anything more than that.
[02:38:14.440 --> 02:38:18.440]  Especially by the way, first thing in the morning, first thing in the morning, we tend to be dehydrated
[02:38:18.440 --> 02:38:20.440]  because usually we've gone to the bathroom once or twice
[02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:23.440]  and we haven't replaced our fluids for six or eight hours.
[02:38:23.440 --> 02:38:25.440]  So first thing in the morning, you're dehydrated.
[02:38:25.440 --> 02:38:31.440]  When you drink more water, immediately, within moments, you have more blood volume.
[02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:34.440]  More blood volume means more nutrients and more oxygen.
[02:38:34.440 --> 02:38:38.440]  And by the way, for diabetics, drinking more water is absolutely vital.
[02:38:38.440 --> 02:38:42.440]  And we know 30% of Americans are either pre-diabetic or diabetic.
[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:44.440]  Drinking more water will dilute your blood.
[02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:46.440]  You're a blood sugar, too.
[02:38:46.440 --> 02:38:48.440]  So it's a garbage man.
[02:38:48.440 --> 02:38:50.440]  It helps carry away all the trash.
[02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:56.440]  It makes your blood volume higher and it delivers more nutrients to your tissues.
[02:38:56.440 --> 02:39:02.440]  When you have high blood pressure, by the way, and almost 80 to 100 million Americans are dealing with high blood pressure issues,
[02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:07.440]  that's a sign that your body is trying to deliver more nutrients and more oxygen to the tissues.
[02:39:07.440 --> 02:39:13.440]  Simply drinking more water, by virtue of the fact that it will deliver more nutrients to your body's cells,
[02:39:13.440 --> 02:39:16.440]  will allow your blood pressure to relax.
[02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:18.440]  So drinking more water is important for brain health.
[02:39:18.440 --> 02:39:20.440]  It's important for nutrient delivery.
[02:39:20.440 --> 02:39:22.440]  It's important for detoxification.
[02:39:22.440 --> 02:39:26.440]  But that doesn't make big pharma who happen to be eugenicist more money,
[02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:28.440]  so they don't ever tell you about that at the doctor's office.
[02:39:28.440 --> 02:39:32.440]  Let's continue with the vitamins, minerals, trace elements, cofactors.
[02:39:32.440 --> 02:39:33.440]  Race through them.
[02:39:33.440 --> 02:39:35.440]  EFAs, essential fatty acids.
[02:39:35.440 --> 02:39:39.440]  I don't know if you could come up with one supplement that's more important than essential fatty acids.
[02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:43.440]  They are a must-have nutritional supplement.
[02:39:43.440 --> 02:39:46.440]  They're very difficult to get out of foods because of processing.
[02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:50.440]  Deficiencies in EFAs will wreak havoc on your hormone system.
[02:39:50.440 --> 02:39:52.440]  It will wreak havoc on your skin.
[02:39:52.440 --> 02:39:55.440]  You cannot make collagen for your skin, like with vitamin C.
[02:39:55.440 --> 02:39:58.440]  You can't make collagen without essential fatty acids.
[02:39:58.440 --> 02:40:02.440]  You can't make the skin's barrier, so you'll be dealing with all kinds of skin problems.
[02:40:02.440 --> 02:40:03.440]  You'll have joint stiffness.
[02:40:03.440 --> 02:40:04.440]  You'll have pain in your joints.
[02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:06.440]  You'll have poor wound repair.
[02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:09.440]  If you're a woman, you'll be dealing with PMS, essential fatty acids.
[02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:13.440]  They're almost like a cure for premenstrual syndrome issues.
[02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:17.440]  The big problem with essential fatty acids, you and I have talked about this in the past,
[02:40:17.440 --> 02:40:20.440]  is if you're deficient, you'll find yourself craving fats.
[02:40:20.440 --> 02:40:22.440]  You won't be able to stay away from the French fries.
[02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:25.440]  That's one of the neat things about nutritional supplementation,
[02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:30.440]  is it will allow you to wean yourself off of foods that you know are bad for you,
[02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:36.440]  but that you cannot resist food manufacturers and chemical companies understand
[02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:41.440]  that under conditions of nutritional deficiencies, we won't be able to stop eating the French fries.
[02:40:41.440 --> 02:40:44.440]  That's Aaron. Aaron lost 92 pounds over a year.
[02:40:44.440 --> 02:40:49.440]  He's now six months into keeping it off, but now his muscles are building up.
[02:40:49.440 --> 02:40:52.440]  He literally has had a total transformation.
[02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:55.440]  The video of that is now posted at infowarseteam.com.
[02:40:55.440 --> 02:40:58.440]  We aired it on the radio yesterday, but for people that want to see the before and after,
[02:40:58.440 --> 02:41:03.440]  it's at infowarseteam.com. Just posted there last night.
[02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:06.440]  You didn't even talk about weight loss.
[02:41:06.440 --> 02:41:11.440]  Whatever he was craving pizza or whatever, he just would take essential fatty acids.
[02:41:11.440 --> 02:41:12.440]  Go ahead.
[02:41:12.440 --> 02:41:17.440]  That's exactly right. When you're craving fats, that's your body's cry for good fats.
[02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:22.440]  Your body doesn't have a cry for French fry fats, but it has a loud cry for essential fatty acids,
[02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:27.440]  and we just don't listen or understand or interpret our body's signals.
[02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:31.440]  Again, on EFA's, the French fries are just not going to taste good to you.
[02:41:31.440 --> 02:41:35.440]  Same with the ice cream and same with the potato chips and all the other fatty foods that we're addicted to.
[02:41:35.440 --> 02:41:39.440]  Continuing on, one of my favorite minerals, magnesium.
[02:41:39.440 --> 02:41:44.440]  Deficiencies are associated with anxiety, nervousness, jitteriness, magnesium is your relaxing mineral.
[02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:48.440]  Take it before you go to bed and you'll fall asleep much easier.
[02:41:48.440 --> 02:41:53.440]  I started doing that because I sleep pretty good, but the dogs bark, the kids wake up.
[02:41:53.440 --> 02:41:58.440]  If I take a teaspoon of this magnesium stuff that I've gotten from the longevity,
[02:41:58.440 --> 02:42:04.440]  it literally, I sleep like the dead, where you just wake up in the morning, boom, you know, that deep sleep.
[02:42:04.440 --> 02:42:07.440]  It's a drug. That's what they don't tell you.
[02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:12.440]  The vitamins and minerals are the real drugs that are natural that our body's designed to get,
[02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:17.440]  and the pimps don't want us knowing that. They sell us manipulated garbage.
[02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:19.440]  Well, that's a brilliant point.
[02:42:19.440 --> 02:42:24.440]  Nutrients are what drugs dream they could be. When a drug goes to bed at night and has a fantasy,
[02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:29.440]  it fantasizes that it's a nutrient because nutrients give you benefits with no toxicities.
[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:34.440]  This is a medicinal dream come true to have benefits with no toxicities.
[02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:39.440]  If a pharmaceutical company could find a drug that was as powerful as vitamin C,
[02:42:39.440 --> 02:42:43.440]  that had all the benefits of vitamin C or any vitamin or mineral, but had no side effects,
[02:42:43.440 --> 02:42:45.440]  what would that drug be worth?
[02:42:45.440 --> 02:42:49.440]  They could lower your blood pressure. They could fight cancer. They could boost your immune system.
[02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:53.440]  They could build bone among many other things and have zero toxicity.
[02:42:53.440 --> 02:42:56.440]  Can you name a drug like that? There's no drug on planet Earth.
[02:42:56.440 --> 02:43:01.440]  What they're doing is they're coming and adding a molecule or something with a molecule,
[02:43:01.440 --> 02:43:06.440]  and they are starting to patent fish oils and things, but making you pay 10 times more.
[02:43:06.440 --> 02:43:09.440]  That's right. See, a cell depends on nutrients.
[02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:12.440]  Nutrients are a cell's support system.
[02:43:12.440 --> 02:43:15.440]  Nutrients are like the cavalry. They carry the forces of life.
[02:43:15.440 --> 02:43:19.440]  Drugs are like Darth Vader. Drugs force a cell to do their bidding,
[02:43:19.440 --> 02:43:22.440]  all supposedly in the interest of a greater good.
[02:43:22.440 --> 02:43:25.440]  Drugs are like communists dictated, like Mao.
[02:43:25.440 --> 02:43:28.440]  They suppose it in the interest of the greater good of the body.
[02:43:28.440 --> 02:43:30.440]  They poison the individual cells.
[02:43:30.440 --> 02:43:32.440]  Nutrients are like your family.
[02:43:32.440 --> 02:43:36.440]  Nutrients work with cells. Drugs work against a cell.
[02:43:36.440 --> 02:43:38.440]  That's all you need to know right there.
[02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:43.440]  Nutrients work with the cell's chemistry. They are the support system for a cell.
[02:43:43.440 --> 02:43:46.440]  Drugs work against a cell.
[02:43:46.440 --> 02:43:50.440]  From a cell perspective, they are the quintessential adversary.
[02:43:50.440 --> 02:43:51.440]  They are poisons.
[02:43:51.440 --> 02:43:54.440]  Literally, they are handled by the body's poison control system,
[02:43:54.440 --> 02:43:58.440]  and this whole idea of medications and drugs and prescriptions being handled
[02:43:58.440 --> 02:44:02.440]  by the poison control system in the body, which is impeccable.
[02:44:02.440 --> 02:44:05.440]  This whole idea of drugs being handled this way has two important implications.
[02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:09.440]  Number one, it depletes your bodies of nutrients.
[02:44:09.440 --> 02:44:14.440]  The more prescription drugs you're taking, the more nutritional deficiencies you will have.
[02:44:14.440 --> 02:44:17.440]  Nutrients are typically not replaced.
[02:44:17.440 --> 02:44:21.440]  And also, secondly, focusing on drugs makes it more likely
[02:44:21.440 --> 02:44:24.440]  that not all other things will get cleared out.
[02:44:24.440 --> 02:44:28.440]  If your poison control system is overwhelmed from detoxifying your statin drugs
[02:44:28.440 --> 02:44:33.440]  or from detoxifying your antibiotics or detoxifying whatever medications you're on,
[02:44:33.440 --> 02:44:36.440]  your immune system turns off and you get cancer.
[02:44:36.440 --> 02:44:41.440]  You'll be depleting your body's ability to handle these cancer-causing substances.
[02:44:41.440 --> 02:44:45.440]  You're going to be depleting your impeccable poison control system's energy.
[02:44:45.440 --> 02:44:48.440]  You'll be increasing the risks of poisons being built up.
[02:44:48.440 --> 02:44:51.440]  And even worse, you're going to be building up toxic intermediaries.
[02:44:51.440 --> 02:44:55.440]  And this is a point that's missed when we hear about drugs.
[02:44:55.440 --> 02:44:57.440]  We hear about side effects, and they're hideous.
[02:44:57.440 --> 02:45:01.440]  But even worse, you're depleting your body's ability to handle poisons.
[02:45:01.440 --> 02:45:05.440]  You're depleting your body's ability to handle cancer-causing substances.
[02:45:05.440 --> 02:45:09.440]  You're depleting your body's ability to handle substances that cause disease.
[02:45:09.440 --> 02:45:12.440]  And you may not even make the connection between the two.
[02:45:12.440 --> 02:45:17.440]  There's not a single drug on planet Earth that can heal anything in the body.
[02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:21.440]  They are simply there to change test markers and to eliminate symptoms.
[02:45:21.440 --> 02:45:24.440]  On the other hand, by using nutritional supplements,
[02:45:24.440 --> 02:45:27.440]  you can literally reverse the disease process.
[02:45:27.440 --> 02:45:31.440]  That's the beauty of good nutrition, and that's why I'm a nutritional pharmacist, Alex.
[02:45:31.440 --> 02:45:37.440]  That's why I practice nutrition instead of dispensing toxic pharmaceutical drugs,
[02:45:37.440 --> 02:45:41.440]  because nutrients are the quintessential premier medicines.
[02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:47.440]  They are the very definition of what a medicine should be, with no toxicity.
[02:45:47.440 --> 02:45:50.440]  All right, continuing here. Let's get into...
[02:45:50.440 --> 02:45:54.440]  We've gotten into magnesium. We've gotten into fatty acids.
[02:45:54.440 --> 02:45:58.440]  Let's get into selenium. Then let's get into other minerals, cofactors,
[02:45:58.440 --> 02:46:01.440]  and some of the things from your research and other major studies,
[02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:06.440]  some of the other things that have been found that really supercharge things
[02:46:06.440 --> 02:46:09.440]  and help your body use all of these things in concert.
[02:46:09.440 --> 02:46:13.440]  Selenium is unbelievably important for the body's detox system.
[02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:16.440]  We just talked about the poison control system.
[02:46:16.440 --> 02:46:19.440]  There's a chemical in the body called glutathione.
[02:46:19.440 --> 02:46:22.440]  Some of your listeners may have heard of glutathione.
[02:46:22.440 --> 02:46:25.440]  Glutathione is your master cancer fighter.
[02:46:25.440 --> 02:46:29.440]  It's your master antioxidant, your master detoxification element,
[02:46:29.440 --> 02:46:32.440]  and it runs on a little selenium battery.
[02:46:32.440 --> 02:46:36.440]  One of the neat things about minerals is they function electromagnetically
[02:46:36.440 --> 02:46:40.440]  as batteries that charge enzymes, and one of the most important enzymes
[02:46:40.440 --> 02:46:42.440]  that selenium charges is glutathione.
[02:46:42.440 --> 02:46:46.440]  Without selenium, you can't make this master cancer fighter.
[02:46:46.440 --> 02:46:49.440]  Selenium is also an important component in thyroid health.
[02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:52.440]  You definitely want to think about getting on selenium.
[02:46:52.440 --> 02:46:55.440]  Selenium deficiency is associated with muscle weakness.
[02:46:55.440 --> 02:46:58.440]  It's associated with fatigue. It's associated with joint disease.
[02:46:58.440 --> 02:47:02.440]  Selenium deficiency can cause miscarriages and birth defects,
[02:47:02.440 --> 02:47:08.440]  and perhaps most importantly, selenium deficiency is associated with cardiovascular disease,
[02:47:08.440 --> 02:47:11.440]  which is the leading killer in this country and around the world,
[02:47:11.440 --> 02:47:14.440]  and you don't need very much selenium.
[02:47:14.440 --> 02:47:17.440]  Just the amount of selenium that would fit on a couple of pinheads
[02:47:17.440 --> 02:47:22.440]  is all you need as a daily dose to assure that you don't suffer from these deficiency diseases.
[02:47:22.440 --> 02:47:26.440]  That's a tiny, tiny little bit of this very important substance, selenium,
[02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:28.440]  and selenium is one that you can take too much of,
[02:47:28.440 --> 02:47:32.440]  and that's why when you're using a nutritional supplement program,
[02:47:32.440 --> 02:47:34.440]  something like the Beyond Tangy Tangerine,
[02:47:34.440 --> 02:47:36.440]  you don't have to concern yourself with the doses as much
[02:47:36.440 --> 02:47:40.440]  because the formulators have taken care of those dosages for you.
[02:47:40.440 --> 02:47:43.440]  Let's talk about this, and then I want to go into some of the current news items
[02:47:43.440 --> 02:47:47.440]  that you wanted to mention, and there's other key co-factors and things
[02:47:47.440 --> 02:47:53.440]  like what you were just mentioning, but why are they attacking eggs and even whey protein?
[02:47:53.440 --> 02:47:55.440]  I guess they don't want us healthy.
[02:47:55.440 --> 02:47:59.440]  LA Times says eating whole eggs is dangerous, is smoking,
[02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:02.440]  but then our brain is mainly made out of these good cholesterol.
[02:48:02.440 --> 02:48:05.440]  Is it true that we should be on a low-fat diet?
[02:48:05.440 --> 02:48:10.440]  Well, even Ansel Keys is the father of the so-called fat and cholesterol hypothesis
[02:48:10.440 --> 02:48:13.440]  has come out saying that we've known all along
[02:48:13.440 --> 02:48:18.440]  that dietary cholesterol has nothing to do with the amount of cholesterol in your body.
[02:48:18.440 --> 02:48:21.440]  This whole thing on eggs, I'm going to talk about this on my program tomorrow,
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:23.440]  this whole thing on eggs is absolutely tragic.
[02:48:23.440 --> 02:48:28.440]  If anybody listens to this silliness that's coming out of this study in Canada,
[02:48:28.440 --> 02:48:30.440]  it's very, very unfortunate.
[02:48:30.440 --> 02:48:32.440]  First of all, if you look at the numbers,
[02:48:32.440 --> 02:48:34.440]  and you've got to be very careful with how the press reports things,
[02:48:34.440 --> 02:48:36.440]  if you look at the numbers right out of the study,
[02:48:36.440 --> 02:48:41.440]  as it turns out, people who ate the highest amount of eggs
[02:48:41.440 --> 02:48:43.440]  had exactly the same cholesterol,
[02:48:43.440 --> 02:48:48.440]  even higher cholesterol levels than people who ate less eggs.
[02:48:48.440 --> 02:48:52.440]  So this whole idea of eating egg yolks and causing cancer,
[02:48:52.440 --> 02:48:54.440]  this is just a bunch of hooey.
[02:48:54.440 --> 02:48:59.440]  The egg yolk is nature's richest source of nutrients next to human mother's milk.
[02:48:59.440 --> 02:49:02.440]  And not in the white, the nutrients are not in the white when it comes to an egg,
[02:49:02.440 --> 02:49:05.440]  they're in the yolk, and I'm talking vitamin A,
[02:49:05.440 --> 02:49:08.440]  I'm talking the B complex, I'm talking vitamin K,
[02:49:08.440 --> 02:49:13.440]  I'm talking essential fatty acids, magnesium, calcium, vitamin D, copper, iron, manganese,
[02:49:13.440 --> 02:49:15.440]  selenium, zinc, these are all in the yolk.
[02:49:15.440 --> 02:49:18.440]  Well, they even tell people that have epilepsy to eat more eggs
[02:49:18.440 --> 02:49:20.440]  because it's been associated with helping the brain.
[02:49:20.440 --> 02:49:22.440]  I mean, this is known.
[02:49:22.440 --> 02:49:26.440]  So why are they, I mean, if they're going to put taxes on cigarettes,
[02:49:26.440 --> 02:49:28.440]  I guess now they're saying eggs are bad,
[02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:34.440]  Bloomberg wants to tax salt, he wants to tax soft drinks.
[02:49:34.440 --> 02:49:38.440]  Again, making themselves the good guys while ignoring all the real problems.
[02:49:38.440 --> 02:49:41.440]  Are they doing that, knowing they're killing us with the nanny state
[02:49:41.440 --> 02:49:45.440]  so that they can selectively take control, but yeah.
[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:47.440]  You know, that's a point that's well taken,
[02:49:47.440 --> 02:49:49.440]  but you know what, we got to take the control back.
[02:49:49.440 --> 02:49:54.440]  This idea of nutritional supplementation is one of the best ways that you can take charge
[02:49:54.440 --> 02:49:56.440]  of your health and not depend on the doctor.
[02:49:56.440 --> 02:50:00.440]  And Alex, what's going to happen if we end up with this Obamacare thing
[02:50:00.440 --> 02:50:06.440]  with managed care, government-mandated managed care, government-mandated HMOs.
[02:50:06.440 --> 02:50:09.440]  This is going to be an unmitigated health disaster
[02:50:09.440 --> 02:50:12.440]  and our best protection is to understand how to use nutritional supplementation.
[02:50:12.440 --> 02:50:15.440]  And by the way, as far as this study goes on egg yolks,
[02:50:15.440 --> 02:50:19.440]  look to see who the scientists who came up with this study,
[02:50:19.440 --> 02:50:25.440]  Dr. David Spence, the Canadian authors, David Spence and David Jenkins and Gene Dabignan,
[02:50:25.440 --> 02:50:28.440]  see who these guys get paid for
[02:50:28.440 --> 02:50:31.440]  and guess who you will find is writing the checks.
[02:50:31.440 --> 02:50:36.440]  AstraZeneca and the cholesterol, the drug companies that make the cholesterol.
[02:50:36.440 --> 02:50:40.440]  Sure, they want to say it's the cholesterol that's bad, not imbalances in the body
[02:50:40.440 --> 02:50:45.440]  and at the same time they want to put statins in the water, even of children.
[02:50:45.440 --> 02:50:50.440]  So they're creating this world where the building blocks of our body are listed as evil
[02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:55.440]  so they can tax them and regulate them and control them, not letting us have access to it.
[02:50:55.440 --> 02:50:58.440]  The worst drought in 50 years continues
[02:50:58.440 --> 02:51:01.440]  and the first 6 months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:51:01.440 --> 02:51:04.440]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:51:04.440 --> 02:51:10.440]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:51:10.440 --> 02:51:13.440]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business,
[02:51:13.440 --> 02:51:15.440]  blowing up your food prices.
[02:51:15.440 --> 02:51:19.440]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices
[02:51:19.440 --> 02:51:22.440]  by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods direct now
[02:51:22.440 --> 02:51:26.440]  as the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[02:51:26.440 --> 02:51:28.440]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:51:28.440 --> 02:51:32.440]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods direct because we've all known this was coming.
[02:51:32.440 --> 02:51:35.440]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:51:35.440 --> 02:51:38.440]  The fact is you can eat at any time to save money today
[02:51:38.440 --> 02:51:42.440]  and because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:51:42.440 --> 02:51:48.440]  Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:51:48.440 --> 02:51:53.440]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.

[02:52:24.440 --> 02:52:28.440]  So it takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens
[02:52:28.440 --> 02:52:30.440]  with no turning and no obnoxious odors.

[02:54:04.440 --> 02:54:12.440]  No, they don't want us to know that they produced artificial food designed to make us sick and mentally ill.
[02:54:12.440 --> 02:54:16.440]  They don't want you to know if you can't sleep. It's magnesium.
[02:54:16.440 --> 02:54:21.440]  They got a deadly Class 3 narcotic for you.
[02:54:21.440 --> 02:54:25.440]  They don't want you to know you got rot holes in your skin because you don't have enough vitamin C.
[02:54:25.440 --> 02:54:27.440]  You got zits all over the place.
[02:54:27.440 --> 02:54:30.440]  They don't want you to know any of this stuff.
[02:54:30.440 --> 02:54:33.440]  By the way, Paul Watson's article is very powerful.
[02:54:33.440 --> 02:54:36.440]  It's up at infowars.com and prismplutter.com.
[02:54:36.440 --> 02:54:43.440]  DHS classifies new ammo purchases following controversy as they buy even more than $1.4 billion.
[02:54:43.440 --> 02:54:47.440]  And all these different agencies are getting it.
[02:54:47.440 --> 02:54:54.440]  The Post Office, the Social Security Administration, the National Weather Association.
[02:54:54.440 --> 02:54:57.440]  And one of the commenters makes a point of a meaning to make.
[02:54:57.440 --> 02:55:01.440]  Google Excluded Income is their name.
[02:55:01.440 --> 02:55:05.440]  And it's fact, Hollow Point bullets are illegal to use in war.
[02:55:05.440 --> 02:55:08.440]  Yep. Hollow Point bullets are too expensive for practice uses.
[02:55:08.440 --> 02:55:13.440]  Hollow Points are for our heads and torso and arms and legs.
[02:55:13.440 --> 02:55:17.440]  Yeah, I mean, these are bullets for us.
[02:55:17.440 --> 02:55:19.440]  1.4 billion bullets.
[02:55:19.440 --> 02:55:22.440]  Ben, I just had to ask you because you're a smart guy.
[02:55:22.440 --> 02:55:28.440]  What is your take on armored pill boxes checkpoints getting set up at 1.4 plus billion rounds of ammo for us?
[02:55:28.440 --> 02:55:31.440]  I mean, what are these criminal lunatics planning?
[02:55:31.440 --> 02:55:35.440]  Well, you know, it gets to what you were saying before we went to the break.
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:40.440]  We are at risk of losing our individual freedoms because we're not paying attention
[02:55:40.440 --> 02:55:43.440]  and we've abdicated our personal responsibility.
[02:55:43.440 --> 02:55:49.440]  And when it comes to our health, nothing is more dramatic than this idea of medicalizing everything.
[02:55:49.440 --> 02:55:55.440]  The articles we were going to talk about should doctors treat lack of exercise as a medical condition?
[02:55:55.440 --> 02:55:57.440]  We'll do a little bit of overdrive to get into that.
[02:55:57.440 --> 02:55:59.440]  But yeah, I mean, here's my frustration.
[02:55:59.440 --> 02:56:02.440]  I've seen it work with family, Aaron Dykes, I lost 40 pounds.
[02:56:02.440 --> 02:56:06.440]  And then just I'm not in the habit of taking stuff all day, so I quit doing it.
[02:56:06.440 --> 02:56:07.440]  Now I'm back on it.
[02:56:07.440 --> 02:56:12.440]  Even when I know it's real myself, I'm so weak, I can't fully commit.
[02:56:12.440 --> 02:56:13.440]  Ben.
[02:56:13.440 --> 02:56:14.440]  Well, you know what?
[02:56:14.440 --> 02:56:16.440]  You can't fully commit until you do.
[02:56:16.440 --> 02:56:20.440]  Because once you do, you would not want to, once you do commit, you're not going to be, well,
[02:56:20.440 --> 02:56:23.440]  want to be without your beyond tangy tangerine, your nutritional supplements.
[02:56:23.440 --> 02:56:24.440]  And it may be that way.
[02:56:24.440 --> 02:56:26.440]  No, I mean, I take them once or twice today.
[02:56:26.440 --> 02:56:28.440]  You're supposed to take them, you know, three, four times a day.
[02:56:28.440 --> 02:56:30.440]  My point is I've already seen dramatic results.
[02:56:30.440 --> 02:56:34.440]  I just can't believe how real this is and how hidden in plain view.
[02:56:34.440 --> 02:56:36.440]  Like, drink more water, you know.
[02:56:36.440 --> 02:56:37.440]  Right.
[02:56:37.440 --> 02:56:38.440]  Oh, here's another one.
[02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:39.440]  Just breathing.
[02:56:39.440 --> 02:56:43.440]  One of the most powerful ways to lower your blood pressure is to practice diaphragmatic breathing.
[02:56:43.440 --> 02:56:48.440]  Simple oxygen can drop your blood pressure and get you off your anti-hypertensive drugs,
[02:56:48.440 --> 02:56:51.440]  your calcium channel blockers, and your beta blockers.
[02:56:51.440 --> 02:56:55.440]  And by the way, Alex, among the deadliest drugs of all, and there's a lot of deadly drugs,
[02:56:55.440 --> 02:56:57.440]  are these anti-hypertensive drugs.
[02:56:57.440 --> 02:57:02.440]  Now they want to give you the poly pill, which is a combination of different anti,
[02:57:02.440 --> 02:57:05.440]  three or four anti-hypertensive drugs that you take in one pill.
[02:57:05.440 --> 02:57:07.440]  That's what I wanted to ask you next.
[02:57:07.440 --> 02:57:09.440]  And your body's doing all this hyper stuff to keep you alive.
[02:57:09.440 --> 02:57:11.440]  You walk it, you end up killing yourself.
[02:57:11.440 --> 02:57:15.440]  What do you make of all the big pharma documents in like five companies the last month coming out
[02:57:15.440 --> 02:57:19.440]  where they know their drugs are killing us and have no benefit and are laughing at us?
[02:57:19.440 --> 02:57:21.440]  I mean, they're so evil.
[02:57:21.440 --> 02:57:23.440]  Have you heard about Propecia, the baldness drug now?
[02:57:23.440 --> 02:57:24.440]  Yes, tell us.
[02:57:24.440 --> 02:57:30.440]  Propecia is the baldness drug, and now people are surprised that Merck has been hiding the side effects.
[02:57:30.440 --> 02:57:33.440]  The company that makes Propecia has been hiding all the side effects that are associated with this.
[02:57:33.440 --> 02:57:40.440]  But the bottom line here is we shouldn't be surprised because the mechanism of drugs is to block things in the body.
[02:57:40.440 --> 02:57:42.440]  That's why you have anti-hypertensive.
[02:57:42.440 --> 02:57:48.440]  Merck knew that the MMR shot was actually giving people the measles, mumps, and rubella,
[02:57:48.440 --> 02:57:54.440]  and they were like, ha, ha, ha, we'll get more money as we spread the measles, mumps, and rubella.
[02:57:54.440 --> 02:57:56.440]  I mean, it's just the diabolical nature.
[02:57:56.440 --> 02:57:57.440]  It is diabolical.
[02:57:57.440 --> 02:57:58.440]  That's exactly right.
[02:57:58.440 --> 02:58:00.440]  You're playing with the body's chemistry.
[02:58:00.440 --> 02:58:08.440]  If you're on a prescription drug, Alex, your number one health objective needs to be to figure out how to get off that prescription drug.
[02:58:08.440 --> 02:58:11.440]  If you're on a prescription drug, it's not a matter of losing weight.
[02:58:11.440 --> 02:58:13.440]  It's not a matter of going to the gym.
[02:58:13.440 --> 02:58:14.440]  It's not a matter of eating better.
[02:58:14.440 --> 02:58:18.440]  It's a matter of getting off that prescription drug because it's killing you.
[02:58:18.440 --> 02:58:21.440]  And nutritional supplementation is your best strategy.
[02:58:21.440 --> 02:58:23.440]  Yeah, again, because supplements work with the body.
[02:58:23.440 --> 02:58:24.440]  We're designed for those.
[02:58:24.440 --> 02:58:28.440]  Drugs go, like you said, Darth Vader, put a gun to your head,
[02:58:28.440 --> 02:58:45.440]  whereas the natural stuff just works with the body as a family, symbiotic, incredible, and full-
