[00:00.000 --> 00:05.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live on Monday, the 14th day of December 2015, and here's
[00:05.840 --> 00:09.520]  a key report on the takeover of transportation.
[00:09.520 --> 00:16.720]  During the Christmas holiday, back in 1913, Congress enacted a communistic centralization
[00:16.720 --> 00:21.940]  of your money transferred to the control of an elite few.
[00:21.940 --> 00:22.940]  Communistic, you say.
[00:22.940 --> 00:30.480]  Well, the second plank of the communist manifesto states a heavy progressive or graduated income
[00:30.480 --> 00:31.480]  tax.
[00:31.480 --> 00:38.120]  The fifth plank states centralization of credit in the hands of the state by means of a national
[00:38.120 --> 00:42.240]  bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly.
[00:42.240 --> 00:47.360]  Those planks have been long established in the United States, so it stands to reason
[00:47.360 --> 00:50.840]  that we are living in a somewhat communist country.
[00:50.840 --> 00:56.360]  Of course, all of the planks, if researched, apply to the current state of government in
[00:56.360 --> 00:59.480]  the U.S. in one way, shape, or form.
[00:59.480 --> 01:05.960]  For instance, plank number six, centralization of the means of communication and transportation
[01:05.960 --> 01:07.480]  in the hands of the state.
[01:07.480 --> 01:13.000]  Of course, the FCC is all over the control of communications, not to mention the NSA
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.280]  and your friendly neighborhood fusion center, and a lot of socialist controlled examples
[01:17.280 --> 01:23.040]  such as the Postal Service and the government's control of Amtrak and Conrail represents the
[01:23.040 --> 01:28.400]  government's hand being placed in the free enterprise cookie jar for the world to see.
[01:28.400 --> 01:33.080]  But that's only the beginning of where government-controlled transportation is heading.
[01:33.080 --> 01:39.000]  The Huffington Post reports, there's growing confusion about how would-be fliers from Louisiana,
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.440]  Minnesota, New Hampshire, and New York will board planes when provisions of the Real ID
[01:44.440 --> 01:50.760]  Act go into effect because their state ID and driver's license processes fail to meet
[01:50.760 --> 01:52.800]  federal standards.
[01:52.800 --> 01:58.320]  Passengers from those four states would likely need a passport or in the case of non-citizens
[01:58.320 --> 02:02.440]  immigration documents for air travel within the United States.
[02:02.440 --> 02:05.000]  The rules raise several concerns.
[02:05.000 --> 02:09.720]  There's the expense of acquiring a passport or other approved document, then there's the
[02:09.720 --> 02:11.480]  potential for disorder.
[02:11.480 --> 02:16.120]  As agitated passengers learn too late, they can't get through security.
[02:16.120 --> 02:22.080]  The Department of Homeland Security's website reveals that starting on October 10th, visitors
[02:22.080 --> 02:28.560]  seeking access to military bases and almost all federal facilities using their state-issued
[02:28.560 --> 02:36.840]  driver's licenses or ID cards must present proper identification issued by Real ID-compliant
[02:36.840 --> 02:37.840]  states.
[02:37.840 --> 02:43.040]  The DHS continues, to be clear, this update does not affect identification shown at the
[02:43.040 --> 02:47.080]  airports in the United States until announced otherwise.
[02:47.080 --> 02:54.280]  The TSA will continue to accept valid driver's license and ID cards issued by all states.
[02:54.280 --> 02:59.960]  DHS plans to announce the schedule for any changes to air travel requirements by the
[02:59.960 --> 03:04.680]  end of the year and will ensure that state governments and the traveling public are
[03:04.680 --> 03:12.760]  notified at least 120 days in advance of implementation in the very near and real future, a real life
[03:12.760 --> 03:18.000]  controlled matrix where transportation is no longer an individual right.
[03:18.000 --> 03:24.720]  CNN reports, Ford says the newest edition of its X-Max car has a new technology that scans
[03:24.720 --> 03:30.680]  traffic signs and adjusts the throttle to help drivers stay within legal speed limits
[03:30.680 --> 03:32.160]  and avoid fines.
[03:32.160 --> 03:35.720]  But the automated cars won't be obeying the speed limits.
[03:35.720 --> 03:42.040]  BBC reports, Google's self-driving cars are programmed to exceed speed limits by up to
[03:42.040 --> 03:46.320]  10 miles per hour, according to the project's lead software engineer.
[03:46.320 --> 03:51.880]  Dmitry Dolgov told Reuters that when surrounding vehicles were breaking the speed limit, going
[03:51.880 --> 03:57.240]  more slowly could actually present a danger, and the Google car would accelerate to keep
[03:57.240 --> 03:58.240]  up.
[03:58.240 --> 04:04.280]  Of course, Google just wants you pesky humans to know that all 16 and counting reported self-driving
[04:04.280 --> 04:09.360]  car accidents weren't their fault, it was the fault of those meddling humans that wreak
[04:09.360 --> 04:12.920]  of racial guilt and outdated individual freedom.
[04:12.920 --> 04:17.280]  The Daily Mail reports, Google's self-driving car has been involved in several accidents
[04:17.280 --> 04:21.960]  since it was launched, all caused by humans, its testers claim.
[04:21.960 --> 04:27.040]  Driving a big, beautiful speed demon anywhere you want without big brothers sitting in the
[04:27.040 --> 04:32.160]  passenger seat is simply one of those fading American rights that should awaken even the
[04:32.160 --> 04:34.760]  most jaded American mind.
[04:34.760 --> 04:40.320]  Freedom to move, when, how, and where you want to in the United States is priceless until
[04:40.320 --> 04:45.680]  the Socialistic, Communist, Corporate, New World Order buys up that freedom and hands
[04:45.680 --> 04:49.960]  it over to their next installed puppet dictator with a big red bow on it.
[04:49.960 --> 04:55.240]  I suppose Jolly Old Nick better get his self-driving sleigh upgraded so the NSA can check their
[04:55.240 --> 04:57.800]  list to make sure if he's been naughty or nice.
[04:57.800 --> 04:59.800]  John Baum, for info wars dot com.
[04:59.800 --> 05:03.640]  In response to Donald Trump's proposal to ban non-citizen Muslims from entering the
[05:03.640 --> 05:07.400]  U.S. without being properly vetted, Senate Democrats may attempt to create a so-called
[05:07.400 --> 05:12.000]  civil right for anyone, including ISIS militants, to immigrate to the U.S.
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.600]  Senator Pat Laehi, a Democrat from Vermont, proposed an amendment to Title 18 of the U.S.
[05:16.600 --> 05:20.280]  Code to stop the federal government from banning individuals from entering into the United
[05:20.280 --> 05:24.360]  States based on their religion, which would create a dangerous precedent where illegal
[05:24.360 --> 05:28.720]  aliens could claim immigration laws preventing their entry into the U.S. violate their civil
[05:28.720 --> 05:29.720]  rights.
[05:29.720 --> 05:34.200]  In response to the amendment, Republican Senators Jeff Sessions said, quote, it is a move towards
[05:34.200 --> 05:39.040]  the ratification of the idea that global migration is a so-called human right, and that these
[05:39.040 --> 05:42.880]  so-called immigrants' rights must be supreme to the rights of sovereign nations, determine
[05:42.880 --> 05:45.480]  who can and cannot enter their borders.
[05:45.480 --> 05:49.920]  Sessions also warned that any alien-denied entry could file suits to demand entry and
[05:49.920 --> 05:54.920]  claim damages for lost employment, lost welfare benefits, lost income, etc.

[07:58.960 --> 08:06.280]  It's never going to get any better.
[08:06.280 --> 08:07.280]  Don't look for it.
[08:07.280 --> 08:09.800]  Be happy with what you got.
[08:09.800 --> 08:13.040]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[08:13.040 --> 08:15.200]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[08:15.200 --> 08:19.720]  The real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all
[08:19.720 --> 08:21.360]  the important decisions.
[08:21.360 --> 08:22.680]  Forget the politicians.
[08:22.680 --> 08:27.560]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[08:27.560 --> 08:28.760]  You don't.
[08:28.760 --> 08:30.120]  You have no choice.
[08:30.120 --> 08:31.320]  You have owners.
[08:31.320 --> 08:33.600]  They own you.
[08:33.600 --> 08:35.160]  They own everything.
[08:35.160 --> 08:37.160]  They own all the important land.
[08:37.160 --> 08:38.920]  They own and control the corporations.
[08:38.920 --> 08:41.920]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, and
[08:41.920 --> 08:45.480]  city halls, they've got the judges in their backpockets, and they own all the big media
[08:45.480 --> 08:49.320]  companies so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[08:49.320 --> 08:52.440]  They got you by the balls.
[08:52.440 --> 08:58.440]  They want obedient workers, obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the
[08:58.440 --> 09:03.280]  machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with a lower
[09:03.280 --> 09:07.800]  pay, the longer hours to reduce benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension
[09:07.800 --> 09:09.720]  that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[09:09.720 --> 09:14.640]  Now they're coming for your Social Security money so they can give it to their criminal
[09:14.640 --> 09:17.400]  friends on Wall Street.
[09:17.400 --> 09:21.600]  It's a big club, and you ain't in it.
[09:21.600 --> 09:24.640]  You and I are not in the big club.
[09:24.640 --> 09:27.240]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[09:27.240 --> 09:31.120]  It's called the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[09:31.120 --> 09:34.240]  But I'll tell you what, they don't want.
[09:34.240 --> 09:37.720]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[09:37.720 --> 09:41.600]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[09:41.600 --> 09:42.600]  And I think she did not.
[09:42.600 --> 09:43.600]  That doesn't help them.
[09:43.600 --> 09:44.600]  That's against their interest.
[09:44.600 --> 09:45.600]  That's right.
[09:45.600 --> 09:54.320]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[09:54.320 --> 09:59.000]  We never got George Carlin on the broadcast, but we did have one of our reporters interviewing,
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.840]  and he did not believe the official story of 9-11.
[10:01.840 --> 10:07.000]  We were actually trying to get him on, and his publicist said, no, not right now.
[10:07.000 --> 10:11.920]  Maybe next year, and then a week later, he was dead of a heart attack, so we can see
[10:11.920 --> 10:13.320]  why he couldn't come on the show.
[10:13.320 --> 10:17.720]  He was having on and off, again, congestive heart failure, but what an incredible brain.
[10:17.720 --> 10:22.560]  I'll tell you somebody else that I was told was a listener.
[10:22.560 --> 10:26.920]  I was told by the same person that Bruce Willis was a big listener, and Bruce Willis
[10:26.920 --> 10:31.640]  had never come out and said anything about the New World Order.
[10:31.640 --> 10:35.280]  But Rick Linklater, when he made a movie with him, said, no, Bruce Willis listens to your
[10:35.280 --> 10:39.880]  show, knows about your films, he saw a poster of you in the office, and said, oh, yeah,
[10:39.880 --> 10:42.120]  Alex Jones, and I've never really even reached out to Bruce Willis.
[10:42.120 --> 10:44.800]  I think we should just, like, we never reached out to Trump, and then they ended up kind
[10:44.800 --> 10:45.800]  of reaching out to us.
[10:45.800 --> 10:49.000]  We need to go ahead and just reach out to Bruce Willis.
[10:49.000 --> 10:53.640]  And again, it's because celebrity being against tyranny is how we're going to win this fight.
[10:53.640 --> 10:58.520]  I mean, it's one of the biggest areas of propaganda where they use all these celebrities for their
[10:58.520 --> 11:02.800]  anti-gun, their open borders, their globalism, their anti-family agenda, when most of the
[11:02.800 --> 11:07.240]  people that I've run into in Hollywood are libertarians, or they're paleoconservative
[11:07.240 --> 11:09.480]  types.
[11:09.480 --> 11:12.840]  And then Willis did give an interview to Vanity Fair about the New World Order, government
[11:12.840 --> 11:16.880]  killing Kennedy, both parties controlled by globalists, never even tried to get Bruce
[11:16.880 --> 11:17.880]  Willis on.
[11:17.880 --> 11:21.320]  And again, it's not bragging, oh, we have all these celebrities listening to the show,
[11:21.320 --> 11:25.200]  it's that most of them I run into end up being listeners.
[11:25.200 --> 11:29.720]  And that was Rick Linklater that told me about Bruce Willis, and it was the same group of
[11:29.720 --> 11:33.920]  folks that said, oh yeah, and Kurt Russell, when he comes to town, he's a big anti-New
[11:33.920 --> 11:35.520]  World Order guy and likes your show.
[11:35.520 --> 11:36.520]  I love Kurt Russell.
[11:36.520 --> 11:40.280]  I mean, I love every escape from New York, the thing, I mean, this is one of the best
[11:40.280 --> 11:42.040]  actors out there.
[11:42.040 --> 11:48.520]  And again, got a call a few weeks ago, just now reaching out, missed his call, but the
[11:48.520 --> 11:52.920]  dude called up and is a listener.
[11:52.920 --> 11:55.440]  Again, there's just so many people that are ready to talk.
[11:55.440 --> 12:00.120]  I mean, sure, Billy Corrigan will come on, he has a lot of courage, or Adebe Mustaine
[12:00.120 --> 12:04.080]  and get demonized and attacked, or a lot of the other, Viggo Mortensen's come on, ended
[12:04.080 --> 12:05.680]  up reaching out to us as a listener.
[12:05.680 --> 12:10.440]  I mean, it's a wide spectrum of people, most of them I can't say their names because they
[12:10.440 --> 12:14.000]  don't want me to say their names.
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.800]  People even bigger than Kurt Russell or Jeff Bridges that I've met with, that I've visited
[12:19.800 --> 12:24.840]  with, that I've talked to over the years, and they are fully awake listening almost
[12:24.840 --> 12:27.280]  every day.
[12:27.280 --> 12:28.280]  And they won't speak out.
[12:28.280 --> 12:29.280]  They won't get involved.
[12:29.280 --> 12:31.520]  See, Matt Drudge doesn't just speak out and get involved.
[12:31.520 --> 12:36.680]  He came here for solidarity, took a lot of courage, the biggest guy in media, biggest
[12:36.680 --> 12:38.160]  guy on the internet.
[12:38.160 --> 12:42.040]  And so starting the show off today, I'm not bragging about Alex Jones.
[12:42.040 --> 12:47.160]  I want you to know how incredibly popular freedom is.
[12:47.160 --> 12:50.800]  And the info wars is just one focal point of that is Ron Paul pointed out.
[12:50.800 --> 12:52.320]  He said, listen, I'm not that special.
[12:52.320 --> 12:54.400]  I'm just a focal point of the Liberty Movement.
[12:54.400 --> 12:57.720]  All of us together is what's special.
[12:57.720 --> 12:58.720]  Kurt Russell.
[12:58.720 --> 12:59.720]  I'm going to play this again.
[12:59.720 --> 13:00.840]  They played it on Friday and Sunday.
[13:00.840 --> 13:08.840]  Kurt Russell pushes back against antique gun, Hollywood.
[13:08.840 --> 13:11.920]  And that was the Tea Party is interviewing.
[13:11.920 --> 13:15.960]  And again, I had heard that Kurt Russell was anti-globalist pro-gun and a listener.
[13:15.960 --> 13:19.680]  I had not confirmed that, but I mean, who I heard it from absolutely, it wouldn't make
[13:19.680 --> 13:22.560]  it up.
[13:22.560 --> 13:23.720]  And I just love it.
[13:23.720 --> 13:24.880]  The solidarity of this.
[13:24.880 --> 13:26.280]  I mean, what an awesome actor.
[13:26.280 --> 13:27.280]  What a great guy.
[13:27.280 --> 13:29.280]  I mean, Snake Plisken, the ultimate character.
[13:29.280 --> 13:31.640]  I can watch that movie 50 times.
[13:31.640 --> 13:32.640]  Leavan Cleef, all of it.
[13:32.640 --> 13:36.280]  Oh my gosh, John Carpenter in his heyday was the best.
[13:36.280 --> 13:39.200]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip of Kurt Russell.
[13:39.200 --> 13:43.960]  That stuff gets really bad as the knives come out against the Second Amendment.
[13:43.960 --> 13:47.840]  More and more patriots begin to stand up and I want to encourage them all do more.
[13:47.840 --> 13:48.840]  Take action.
[13:48.840 --> 13:49.840]  Speak out.
[13:49.840 --> 13:50.840]  Here it is.
[13:50.840 --> 13:57.200]  The guys who are on the no-fly list, no-fly list because of terrorist connections can
[13:57.200 --> 13:58.960]  get a gun pretty easily.
[13:58.960 --> 14:01.600]  They can also make a bomb pretty easily.
[14:01.600 --> 14:04.080]  So they can also get knives and stab you.
[14:04.080 --> 14:05.080]  What are you going to do about that?
[14:05.080 --> 14:07.080]  They can get cars and run you over with them.
[14:07.080 --> 14:09.080]  What are you going to do about that?
[14:09.080 --> 14:10.080]  What are you going to do about that?
[14:10.080 --> 14:11.080]  They didn't kill the people in San Bernardino.
[14:11.080 --> 14:14.640]  Oh, they've killed others that way, haven't they?
[14:14.640 --> 14:15.640]  Yes.
[14:15.640 --> 14:16.640]  Yes.
[14:16.640 --> 14:17.640]  So what are you going to do?
[14:17.640 --> 14:18.640]  Outlaw everything?
[14:18.640 --> 14:19.640]  That isn't the answer.
[14:19.640 --> 14:22.160]  Just put some control.
[14:22.160 --> 14:23.160]  Put some controls?
[14:23.160 --> 14:24.160]  What?
[14:24.160 --> 14:27.560]  So the people who want to defend themselves can't?
[14:27.560 --> 14:28.560]  No, nothing.
[14:28.560 --> 14:29.560]  You can't.
[14:29.560 --> 14:31.040]  Just so the idiots can't get hold of them.
[14:31.040 --> 14:32.920]  Do you really believe they're not going to?
[14:32.920 --> 14:34.600]  Are you serious about that?
[14:34.600 --> 14:35.920]  Are you seriously?
[14:35.920 --> 14:37.120]  What good will that go?
[14:37.120 --> 14:38.120]  Oh, my God.
[14:38.120 --> 14:39.120]  You and I just disagree.
[14:39.120 --> 14:40.120]  Okay.
[14:40.120 --> 14:41.120]  You and I just disagree.
[14:41.120 --> 14:49.160]  But I understand that you think that you can control the behavior of people that are dead
[14:49.160 --> 14:53.800]  set on taking your way of life away from you.
[14:53.800 --> 14:56.080]  I think you think you can control that.
[14:56.080 --> 14:57.080]  No.
[14:57.080 --> 15:00.560]  And there's only one thing you can do with that and say, no, dude, that's not going to
[15:00.560 --> 15:01.560]  happen.
[15:01.560 --> 15:03.560]  That's just not going to happen.
[15:03.560 --> 15:06.560]  We're going to speak with you, man.
[15:06.560 --> 15:07.560]  Good talking to you.
[15:07.560 --> 15:08.560]  Good talking to you.
[15:08.560 --> 15:12.160]  There's only one thing you said to terrorist, I don't care what you do, you're not taking
[15:12.160 --> 15:13.160]  our way of life.
[15:13.160 --> 15:16.160]  We're not scared of you.
[15:16.160 --> 15:20.320]  I mean, if terrorists blew up a major city and killed a million people with an A-bomb,
[15:20.320 --> 15:24.720]  will we capitulate and get rid of our Bill of Rights and Constitution and Declaration
[15:24.720 --> 15:30.360]  of Independence that makes this America, that the powerful corporate forces have been trying
[15:30.360 --> 15:32.320]  to dismantle forever?
[15:32.320 --> 15:34.360]  That's running up the white flag.
[15:34.360 --> 15:36.200]  And running up the white flag won't protect us.
[15:36.200 --> 15:41.120]  We don't get security from giving up liberty.
[15:41.120 --> 15:49.000]  So I do want to go on an initiative to get Kurt Russell on and to get Bruce Willis on
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.400]  and to get Jeff Bridges on because these are people I know are listeners.
[15:53.400 --> 15:59.800]  I mean, Bridges tried to call me, but he did it over another someone else's phone and then
[15:59.800 --> 16:03.440]  I just haven't gotten around to actually trying to call him yet because I don't want to bug
[16:03.440 --> 16:06.160]  these people because I'm not even really into the celebrity stuff.
[16:06.160 --> 16:07.160]  I admire them.
[16:07.160 --> 16:10.200]  I love their acting skills, but at the end of the day, just feels weird even trying to
[16:10.200 --> 16:11.720]  chase them around and get them on.
[16:11.720 --> 16:14.520]  But the solidarity of it, people really love.
[16:14.520 --> 16:16.680]  I mean, it wasn't that Donald Trump came on my show.
[16:16.680 --> 16:17.680]  He does lots of shows.
[16:17.680 --> 16:21.680]  And so he came on and said, I'm not going to let you down.
[16:21.680 --> 16:26.120]  You have a great reputation as a patriot fighting tyranny and, you know, come up to New
[16:26.120 --> 16:28.720]  York and let's have dinner and set that off air.
[16:28.720 --> 16:36.480]  But the point is he knows that that's going to make them attack him.
[16:36.480 --> 16:40.320]  He knew all that was coming and he knows how discredited they are.
[16:40.320 --> 16:41.880]  He wants it to blow up in their face.
[16:41.880 --> 16:47.480]  That's why they promoted the interview, attacking it, 2,600 plus articles on Google in one day
[16:47.480 --> 16:54.080]  and they're all ended, all ended on a dime because they were like, whoa, drop that.
[16:54.080 --> 16:58.760]  There's finally getting it, like whenever Rand Paul had won the Senate and Politico
[16:58.760 --> 17:01.360]  called me up and wanted to do an interview.
[17:01.360 --> 17:03.480]  And I said, I don't usually do interviews, but I said, I'm just going to give you about
[17:03.480 --> 17:06.360]  a one minute interview and you promise you're going to quote this.
[17:06.360 --> 17:10.200]  And they said, yes, and they did part of it, not the whole thing.
[17:10.200 --> 17:13.860]  And I said, the only way you can defeat Rand Paul is to endorse him.
[17:13.860 --> 17:14.860]  You're out of bullets.
[17:14.860 --> 17:16.060]  No one believes you anymore.
[17:16.060 --> 17:17.060]  You were a joke.
[17:17.060 --> 17:21.560]  You're a fraud.
[17:21.560 --> 17:26.600]  And they didn't quote the whole thing when they quoted part of it, but they just can't
[17:26.600 --> 17:27.600]  help it.
[17:27.600 --> 17:31.480]  They still think they can attack with lies and twisted garbage like the Washington Post
[17:31.480 --> 17:34.840]  just wrote this weekend about me saying, I believe the moon landings didn't happen.
[17:34.840 --> 17:38.120]  And there's no tape of me saying that.
[17:38.120 --> 17:42.280]  They just know that's a common conspiracy theory that people disdain, so they just throw
[17:42.280 --> 17:43.280]  it at me.
[17:43.280 --> 17:46.520]  I mean, it's ridiculous, but that's why they're so discredited.
[17:46.520 --> 17:49.600]  So just keep lying about me all day.
[17:49.600 --> 17:53.480]  I also believe fluoride in the water is bad.
[17:53.480 --> 17:56.000]  Well, I mean, Harvard has come out.
[17:56.000 --> 17:57.000]  That's true.
[17:57.000 --> 17:58.400]  And said, take it out of the water.
[17:58.400 --> 18:02.680]  It causes 10 point IQ reductions in just a few years, seven-fold increase in bone cancer
[18:02.680 --> 18:08.600]  in men and boys, pancreatic cancer, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, kidney
[18:08.600 --> 18:17.480]  cancer, blood cancer, on and on and on.
[18:17.480 --> 18:19.760]  It's not funny.
[18:19.760 --> 18:20.760]  It's not a joke.
[18:20.760 --> 18:26.560]  They also say, oh, and he say, vaccine denialists.
[18:26.560 --> 18:29.600]  I'm a vaccine denialist.
[18:29.600 --> 18:34.760]  I mean, my gosh, the inserts of every major vaccine say they can kill you.
[18:34.760 --> 18:41.760]  So it's very, very frustrating to sit here and have the mixed reality of what I've said
[18:41.760 --> 18:48.080]  and what I back up with just made up crud, made up bologna sandwiches.
[18:48.080 --> 18:53.520]  They just hand out to everybody full of political cyanide.
[18:53.520 --> 18:58.160]  But it feels so good to see people with courage, like Kurt Russell and others starting to come
[18:58.160 --> 19:00.040]  out about the New World Order.
[19:00.040 --> 19:03.560]  And I know full well, people like Bruce Willis want to as well.
[19:03.560 --> 19:06.560]  And they get, I mean, you ought to see the demonization, the attacks, things Dave Mustain's
[19:06.560 --> 19:10.000]  gone on through for coming on the show, other people.
[19:10.000 --> 19:13.000]  But at a certain point, you just got to take it and realize it's a badge of courage.
[19:13.000 --> 19:18.920]  And if we get all the libertarians and conservatives and patriots and just pro-American type people
[19:18.920 --> 19:23.160]  who aren't globalist, classical liberals on the show or other shows, I don't care where
[19:23.160 --> 19:30.440]  they do it, just show that solidarity of how awake people are and how exciting this is.
[19:30.440 --> 19:34.680]  And that they get it and know what's happening and know what's going on.
[19:34.680 --> 19:40.240]  You know, Kurt Vonnegut was a big listener and he did send me a painting he did for me.
[19:40.240 --> 19:41.800]  And he said, no, I'm done doing speeches.
[19:41.800 --> 19:42.800]  I'm done.
[19:42.800 --> 19:43.800]  I'm done with everything.
[19:43.800 --> 19:47.320]  And he was very cogent that he was dead a month later.
[19:47.320 --> 19:52.280]  So I never got Kurt Vonnegut on either, but it just shows how many great minds are awake
[19:52.280 --> 19:53.280]  to what's happening.
[19:53.280 --> 19:55.560]  We're going to give you the latest when we come back, how they let the terrorists into
[19:55.560 --> 20:00.240]  the country more attacks in Europe by ISIS.
[20:00.240 --> 20:03.640]  My name is Bill Vonner and I have an important message.
[20:03.640 --> 20:09.120]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis,
[20:09.120 --> 20:11.400]  but they're about to lose control.
[20:11.400 --> 20:16.920]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined, from where
[20:16.920 --> 20:21.080]  we shop to the doctors you visit and the family you want to protect.
[20:21.080 --> 20:23.480]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[20:23.480 --> 20:27.680]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[20:27.680 --> 20:32.160]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash and they did.
[20:32.160 --> 20:36.920]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves, but this has nothing to do with the stock
[20:36.920 --> 20:37.920]  market.
[20:37.920 --> 20:39.320]  This will affect us all.
[20:39.320 --> 20:44.240]  I've posted a free video at dollardanger.com.
[20:44.240 --> 20:48.560]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and
[20:48.560 --> 20:50.640]  see the facts for yourself.
[20:50.640 --> 20:56.640]  You can watch the video for free right now by going to dollardanger.com.
[20:56.640 --> 21:00.360]  Again, that's dollardanger.com.
[21:00.360 --> 21:04.600]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better
[21:04.600 --> 21:08.160]  than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood
[21:08.160 --> 21:11.280]  sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[21:11.280 --> 21:15.040]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of
[21:15.040 --> 21:16.040]  them.
[21:16.040 --> 21:17.520]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[21:17.520 --> 21:21.760]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects
[21:21.760 --> 21:23.240]  of Heart and Body Extract.
[21:23.240 --> 21:27.480]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary
[21:27.480 --> 21:33.200]  vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients, so the body will heal itself.
[21:33.200 --> 21:37.760]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol,
[21:37.760 --> 21:39.280]  clean and unclog the arteries.
[21:39.280 --> 21:45.080]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics, so the body is an amazing thing.
[21:45.080 --> 21:48.240]  It simply needs some help, so it has the tools to heal itself.
[21:48.240 --> 21:50.720]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[22:33.920 --> 22:37.320]  Saves can't be accessed quickly, and racks are unsafe for children.

[23:59.600 --> 24:11.540]  He's bound it down, load it up and truck it.
[24:11.540 --> 24:15.020]  He's bound it down, load it up and truck it.
[24:15.020 --> 24:17.140]  Are we gonna do what they say can't be done?
[24:17.140 --> 24:29.100]  He sent me of an open bird cage the birds gone symbol of freedom that kind of goes
[24:29.100 --> 24:34.900]  back to the French Revolution and you can see the hand-drawn face of Kurt
[24:34.900 --> 24:40.140]  Vonnegut right there for Alex and then his signature down there and he sent me
[24:40.140 --> 24:43.500]  one of the little knick-knack I've got at home this has been in my office for a
[24:43.500 --> 24:48.100]  long time but again just to show how many people are awake to the new world
[24:48.100 --> 24:52.860]  order what the globalists are up to and what they're doing and I got reached out
[24:52.860 --> 24:58.380]  to by Kurt Vonnegut's art partner fell out of Tennessee about it and then
[24:58.380 --> 25:01.500]  that's how I talked to Vonnegut down the road and then it was a couple months
[25:01.500 --> 25:06.940]  after I talked to him that I guess he fell and then hit his head and then died
[25:06.940 --> 25:13.060]  but really interesting and again it's just about the amazing solidarity how
[25:13.060 --> 25:17.020]  many patriots are out there of every stripe I mean Kurt Vonnegut would call
[25:17.020 --> 25:20.620]  himself a classical liberal but that's what he called himself one of the
[25:20.620 --> 25:26.540]  greatest satirists ever and now he's gone but what he has produced what he
[25:26.540 --> 25:31.220]  has stood for basically goes on forever unless we extinct this species and I
[25:31.220 --> 25:39.620]  kind of got on that jag playing the clip earlier with George Carlin and just
[25:39.620 --> 25:45.220]  thinking about how smart he was how informed he was how awake he was and
[25:45.220 --> 25:50.940]  what a bummer it is that he's gone as well now the long segments coming up and
[25:50.940 --> 25:55.300]  I'm gonna get serious now GOP establishment worries about Cruz Trump
[25:55.300 --> 25:58.900]  showdown in the debate coming up we'll be covering live here on in four hours
[25:58.900 --> 26:05.260]  nightly news how Donald Trump took the Republican Party by storm we've also
[26:05.260 --> 26:11.820]  got that report now he's still in the lead except in one state and gaining in
[26:11.820 --> 26:15.460]  that lead and I know why Ted Cruz is gaining and in one state and a few
[26:15.460 --> 26:20.140]  others is because Ted Cruz is really smart but Ted Cruz says is really on
[26:20.140 --> 26:29.580]  target he's extremely presidential and I've our enforcers interviewed him
[26:29.580 --> 26:36.500]  before he said he's out of Texas he's Texas senator but I've talked to some
[26:36.500 --> 26:42.460]  pretty high-powered people multiple folks big donors you name it billionaire
[26:42.460 --> 26:49.940]  types I'm gonna leave it at that and they say that Cruz in person we spent
[26:49.940 --> 26:57.900]  about two days with him I'm just gonna leave it at that is interesting they
[26:57.900 --> 27:02.620]  just say that they would support Rand Paul or Donald Trump two different
[27:02.620 --> 27:09.300]  people and they spent time with both of them and I'm not here spreading rumors
[27:09.300 --> 27:14.580]  about Cruz because he's a little bit I had a Trump in one state I've said it
[27:14.580 --> 27:17.980]  before I really like him I admire him he's amazing anybody can talk for 26
[27:17.980 --> 27:24.860]  hours without going to the bathroom fluently is incredible I mean he's got
[27:24.860 --> 27:31.380]  one of the longest filibusters ever so I have no doubt he would be serious to
[27:31.380 --> 27:36.860]  contend with but by any other foreign leader like Putin but his wife was a
[27:36.860 --> 27:40.100]  managing partner in Goldman Sachs they are members of the Council on Foreign
[27:40.100 --> 27:43.660]  Relations they got out of it he said their vipers hey I get that if somebody
[27:43.660 --> 27:47.020]  gets into that learns about it gets out of it speaks out against it and they do
[27:47.020 --> 27:51.100]  good stuff and hey great we gotta have the attitude that if somebody's been on
[27:51.100 --> 27:54.380]  the other team and they come over to our side that we don't just immediately
[27:54.380 --> 28:00.500]  attack them and don't trust them but like Reagan said trust but verify I hope
[28:00.500 --> 28:05.180]  Cruz is for real you know he is dads from a communist country we've done
[28:05.180 --> 28:08.700]  research on him Joel Scowze's on research on him going back time was 14 given
[28:08.700 --> 28:17.940]  anti-communist speeches like my dad did I mean I think he's for real it's just
[28:17.940 --> 28:21.820]  that when it comes to militarism and he wants to take down Syria well that's
[28:21.820 --> 28:26.540]  not right the West started that fight our own Pentagon's come out again in a
[28:26.540 --> 28:31.180]  huge report and said the government is lying about who we're backing this is
[28:31.180 --> 28:34.780]  wrong in Syria and Cruz has been presented with all that
[28:34.780 --> 28:42.340]  Rand Paul's at the right position Donald Trump has the right position if you
[28:42.340 --> 28:46.700]  want to talk to problems with Cruz maybe we should open the phones about Ted Cruz
[28:46.700 --> 28:54.900]  because he's like Obama he pretty much comes from nowhere he was in state
[28:54.900 --> 28:59.180]  government boom US senator on the Tea Party wave that Ron Paul and you and I
[28:59.180 --> 29:03.220]  the listeners started all of us collectively and I hope he's surfing
[29:03.220 --> 29:07.820]  this wave to victory he's already done it the Senate and then he's for real it
[29:07.820 --> 29:12.140]  just means that he needs to know where he came from and he needs to know that we
[29:12.140 --> 29:16.700]  are not gonna put up with any flip-flopping and we're not really
[29:16.700 --> 29:23.180]  seen flip-flopping out of it the toll-free number on Cruz is 800-259-9231
[29:23.180 --> 29:29.420]  first-time callers 800-259-9231 now that's it about 10 minutes after we come
[29:29.420 --> 29:33.620]  back from break I'm gonna really focus and get into the huge ISIS news huge

[30:09.540 --> 30:13.660]  Republican governors they don't give any credit to the free market they don't

[30:18.780 --> 30:23.900]  real issues but if you're not going to respond to the no-fly zone strategy what

[34:16.260 --> 34:22.660]  see this Tashfee Malik reportedly passed background checks and if you look at
[34:22.660 --> 34:29.700]  every photo of her she looks completely psychopathic completely murderous
[34:29.700 --> 34:37.540]  completely mentally ill completely chip on the shoulder arrogant because folks
[34:37.540 --> 34:41.860]  from super suppressed countries like Saudi Arabia where she couldn't even
[34:41.860 --> 34:46.900]  walk around with her face out normally if she was caught outside her house or
[34:46.900 --> 34:51.820]  driving she'd be in prison or executed she can't under Stockholm syndrome
[34:51.820 --> 34:57.260]  admit to herself that was wrong so she shows up in California in the middle of
[34:57.260 --> 35:01.700]  porn land with a lot of decadence and things that are obviously bad in
[35:01.700 --> 35:06.860]  anti-human in many respects another extreme and they can't handle it and
[35:06.860 --> 35:10.660]  they can't handle a Christian or a Jew you know talk about their religion in
[35:10.660 --> 35:16.220]  front of them and you look at her it's it's the chip on the shoulder the social
[35:16.220 --> 35:20.100]  engineering how they merge Islam and all its oppression with the left and class
[35:20.100 --> 35:27.060]  warfare and the social envy of the women in the dresses and the sexy outfits
[35:27.060 --> 35:31.660]  and the cool cars and the money and a normal liberal flips out if they can't
[35:31.660 --> 35:35.060]  have all that and just hates everybody but you mix that that's why radical
[35:35.060 --> 35:40.140]  socialist and social envy types merge with radical Islam because it's a hate
[35:40.140 --> 35:45.900]  prosperity movement who want to cut off their noses despite their face and don't
[35:45.900 --> 35:51.780]  want to take the good that's in the West they want to just project the bad onto
[35:51.780 --> 35:56.460]  all of it and remember it's the very sick Hollywood groups that are pushing the
[35:56.460 --> 36:00.180]  sexualization of children that are pushing the degradation of children
[36:00.180 --> 36:04.500]  that are pushing the degradation of men as role models who then push the leftist
[36:04.500 --> 36:08.820]  view don't criticize Islam don't criticize radical Islam cover it up
[36:08.820 --> 36:14.020]  call anybody a bigger who doesn't support it and it is a form of sickening
[36:14.020 --> 36:21.020]  decadent mental illness leftist cuckolding that they're engaged in the
[36:21.020 --> 36:25.140]  Sumner red stones the Michael Moore's that are into all this and who want to
[36:25.140 --> 36:28.780]  disarm the American people while they themselves have bodyguards it's an
[36:28.780 --> 36:37.260]  act of climbing on to the dining table at a huge ball with a big bowl of punch
[36:37.260 --> 36:41.140]  pulling their drawers down leaning over the edge of it like it's a toilet and
[36:41.140 --> 36:46.500]  doing you know what and that's who these people spiritually are they're freaks
[36:46.500 --> 36:51.260]  they're out of control and it's an act of domination they can bring in hundreds
[36:51.260 --> 36:55.580]  of thousands and millions in Europe of people who are absolutely incompatible
[36:55.580 --> 37:00.340]  you know they're now violating orders all over Europe because he's ordered not
[37:00.340 --> 37:03.340]  to do this they said don't search their cell phones don't search him it
[37:03.340 --> 37:06.420]  violates the rights when they're illegals coming in marching in by the
[37:06.420 --> 37:11.580]  thousands every day literally robbing stealing killing and the police are just
[37:11.580 --> 37:13.940]  doing it they're grabbing the cell phones they're uploading it for the public

[37:19.340 --> 37:23.380]  churches this is their trophies like the average Western man wants to go hunt
[37:23.380 --> 37:26.780]  elk and put a trophy on the wall and talk about the story or they have a
[37:26.780 --> 37:31.220]  12-pound bass on the wall maybe a 14-foot hammerhead on the wall like my daddy
[37:31.220 --> 37:36.700]  used to have so my mother got sick of it on the wall
[37:38.260 --> 37:43.180]  well now no you got a Christian you got a Catholic priest nor the Docs priest
[37:43.180 --> 37:48.460]  that's like having a bull elephant on your wall there's a new headline secret
[37:48.460 --> 37:53.060]  US policy blocks agents from looking at social media via applicants formal
[37:53.060 --> 37:57.580]  official says that's ABC news I got a stack of this today there's a stack of
[37:57.580 --> 38:06.340]  this every day but in Europe they can't look at their cell phones but they're
[38:06.340 --> 38:10.820]  doing it I'm an article today and it goes through the videos it's not just
[38:10.820 --> 38:15.780]  head chopping videos it's them chopping heads off in first-person these are
[38:15.780 --> 38:20.620]  precious little goodies what do you think happens when they've got upwards of
[38:20.620 --> 38:27.140]  300,000 men that have invaded and taken over the areas after the ISIS and
[38:27.140 --> 38:31.660]  El Nuzra troops go through they come in with their families and move into the
[38:31.660 --> 38:37.300]  houses and posed by the swimming pools and you know posed by the dead dad in
[38:37.300 --> 38:40.300]  the back and then hell just go ahead and rape the daughters and sell them in a
[38:40.300 --> 38:43.140]  sex slavery because well they're not the proper type of Muslims they're not
[38:43.140 --> 38:49.980]  Sunnis they're Shiites so they deserve as sewage water is what is quoted in
[38:49.980 --> 38:54.780]  Arabic sewage water but like the US professor says Christians and Jews are
[38:54.780 --> 38:58.740]  sewage water you can rob them you can kill them it doesn't matter thank you
[38:58.740 --> 39:03.740]  for the taxpayer money and it's the classic arrogance of a white
[39:03.740 --> 39:07.740]  supremacist or a black supremacist or a Mexican supremacist or whoever just to
[39:07.740 --> 39:12.060]  say you know we are the supreme you're all dirt we can do what we want to do to

[39:57.540 --> 40:00.940]  fighters back in because a lot of them were Western and were allowed to recruit
[40:00.940 --> 40:06.900]  to be sent in by the West the Pentagon is officially now on record not just
[40:06.900 --> 40:13.820]  general Clark not just all these other generals now I've got a report today where

[42:21.300 --> 42:25.300]  take all our guns all our freedoms and you're rid of all our free speech of the
[42:25.300 --> 42:30.260]  Muslims Christians atheists whoever you are we're gonna lose everything that's
[42:30.260 --> 42:33.460]  the class of civilizations and out of the class of civilizations that Albert
[42:33.460 --> 42:38.220]  Pike envisioned that Dick Cheney wrote about 2000 they will bring us total
[42:38.220 --> 42:42.100]  suppression of individual liberty and freedom is that really what the left
[42:42.100 --> 42:47.300]  once well you watch CNN or MSNBC they get up there and say absolutely Melissa
[42:47.300 --> 42:50.780]  Harris Perry is back with the people's play clip of that she doesn't like Darth
[42:50.780 --> 42:55.420]  Vader because he's black and he had white till he becomes good well that's because
[42:55.420 --> 43:01.420]  the Skywalker's are white and it's because black projects power and his
[43:01.420 --> 43:09.380]  ominous and his strong and historically I mean I got a black car not because I'm
[43:09.380 --> 43:12.860]  like I don't like black people I got a black car because it looks good Darth
[43:12.860 --> 43:17.980]  Vader wouldn't look good if he was pink woody or if he was gray he looks good
[43:17.980 --> 43:23.140]  because he's black and he's got a black man's voice as it sounds good I mean
[43:23.140 --> 43:26.820]  this is just ridiculous but this is how everything's racist you know if you say
[43:26.820 --> 43:30.700]  that Paul Ryan's a hard worker that's putting down black slaves she attaches
[43:30.700 --> 43:35.820]  racism to every symbol every word where she controls it she is the ultimate
[43:35.820 --> 43:41.300]  control freak we should reject this cult leader here she is see Darth Vader's
[43:41.300 --> 43:47.260]  racist now folks here it is I know why I have feelings good bad and otherwise
[43:47.260 --> 43:52.220]  about Star Wars and I have a lot I spent the whole day talking about the whole
[43:52.220 --> 43:59.020]  Darth Vader situation yeah like the part where he was totally a black guy
[43:59.020 --> 44:04.060]  whose name basically was James Earl Jones and while he was black he was
[44:04.060 --> 44:07.780]  terrible and bad and awful and used to cut off white men's hands and didn't you
[44:07.780 --> 44:10.980]  know actually claim his son but as soon as he claims his son and goes over to
[44:10.980 --> 44:15.300]  the good he takes off his mask and he is white oh yes I have many many feelings
[44:15.300 --> 44:21.860]  about that but I will try to put them over here I mean this is insane no he
[44:21.860 --> 44:24.140]  talks like that because he's talking through a respirator that's what it's
[44:24.140 --> 44:28.660]  supposed to sound like it's computerized the plans you refer to soon be back in
[44:28.660 --> 44:33.980]  our hands don't act so surprised your highness you want on the mercy mission
[44:33.980 --> 44:40.820]  this time I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you would it be
[44:40.820 --> 44:45.780]  okay if I did the voice sweet okay so with me black guy it's a white guy does
[44:45.780 --> 44:50.380]  that NFL before he died I guess voice of God
[44:53.220 --> 44:57.580]  you know I was thinking about doing a voiceover professionally because I have
[44:57.580 --> 45:02.540]  had some offers actually do NFL style voiceovers because they can't most those
[45:02.540 --> 45:06.100]  guys have died now they can't really find but I can do those voices and I can
[45:06.100 --> 45:10.340]  kind of perfect them maybe I should do some right now for you it was a white
[45:10.340 --> 45:13.460]  guy did the voiceover for heavy metal he also did a lot of other commercials
[45:13.460 --> 45:19.180]  maybe you heard this one when you speak well you command respect you move ahead
[45:19.180 --> 45:25.700]  faster try a verbal advantage now or he did this voice I forget his name it's a
[45:25.700 --> 45:32.980]  my evil extends across all time all galaxies all dimensions a green jewel
[45:32.980 --> 45:43.340]  look into me one more time kind of fun isn't it I did do some national voice
[45:43.340 --> 45:47.380]  overs my goodness you know I could make more money doing national voiceovers

[54:25.820 --> 54:29.740]  story I think we wrote one back on Friday too we really need to talk about
[54:29.740 --> 54:33.300]  that because info wars does not have this right now I'm gonna just copy the
[54:33.300 --> 54:37.140]  hot air story over to info wars we show through a story about celebrities that
[54:37.140 --> 54:41.260]  are pro-gun and just let people know how many of them there are and you're like
[54:41.260 --> 54:44.460]  who cares what celebrities think well that's what the public thinks I guess
[54:44.460 --> 54:48.380]  we did do a story about it Kurt Russell schools reporter on gun control so we
[54:48.380 --> 54:54.900]  did have one back on Friday so boom good job guys very very exciting to see
[54:54.900 --> 54:59.580]  that going on so let's repost both of the front of info wars because the average
[54:59.580 --> 55:03.780]  Joe out there does not know this is going on I know we got Ethan I know we
[55:03.780 --> 55:07.220]  got Mike James Anthony Mike and others we're gonna start going to you into the
[55:07.220 --> 55:13.620]  next segment I'm gonna get our guests from Britannic aisle on about 10 minutes
[55:13.620 --> 55:15.740]  into the next hour they'll be with us for the rest of the hour but I will
[55:15.740 --> 55:18.540]  continue with your calls until then but they'll be with us a little bit in the
[55:18.540 --> 55:24.420]  next hour after that as well the founder of the English defense league which has
[55:24.420 --> 55:30.220]  been arrested for trying to protest radical Islam put in prison and he got
[55:30.220 --> 55:33.940]  out of it when it became racist and he's attacked by the white supremacist and
[55:33.940 --> 55:38.860]  the radical Islamist so that gentleman will be joining us coming up with Paul
[55:38.860 --> 55:45.780]  Joseph Watson from the UK Tommy Robinson will be joining us Obama is
[55:45.780 --> 55:52.740]  speaking right now on ISIS and it's a big deal because we have as I just
[55:52.740 --> 55:54.900]  mentioned the Department of Defense coming out I'm gonna cover that the
[55:54.900 --> 56:00.820]  third hour today saying we run ISIS Turkey runs ISIS it's horrible we got
[56:00.820 --> 56:04.780]  to stop there's now an official inspector general investigation so this is way
[56:04.780 --> 56:10.740]  beyond whitewater or or Watergate or you little petty stuff compared to this
[56:10.740 --> 56:15.580]  this is a big deal and the House of Cards is coming down but Obama says no
[56:15.580 --> 56:20.380]  strategy changes expected no just fake bombing and bombing military bases
[56:20.380 --> 56:24.900]  with the Russians they're in Syria blowing up their missiles there'll be
[56:24.900 --> 56:29.220]  lots of that in the fight against ISIS they'll be bombing and with artillery
[56:29.220 --> 56:33.740]  out of Turkey attacking the Russians and the Syrians so there you go but did I
[56:33.740 --> 56:36.820]  mention Obama's black so it's okay because oh by the way Melissa here
[56:36.820 --> 56:40.860]  Perry doesn't like me obviously because I criticize her's criticizes me but I
[56:40.860 --> 56:43.340]  always attack her on her policies and what she does I'm gonna be under the
[56:43.340 --> 56:47.100]  belt today and I'm gonna attack her for what she looks like with her makeup off
[56:47.100 --> 56:51.620]  I just want to tell her that I personally think it's wrong for her but on so much
[56:51.620 --> 56:57.500]  makeup that it becomes a mask and I mean do we have the image guys I'm Melissa
[56:57.500 --> 57:03.340]  Harris Perry with makeup then you remove the makeup and well I just want to say
[57:03.340 --> 57:08.180]  that if there was an alien force taking over the planet they would try to get
[57:08.180 --> 57:11.300]  humans to fight with each other over skin color as a divide and conquer
[57:11.300 --> 57:14.460]  strategy but especially on aliens from deep space it's the British great game
[57:14.460 --> 57:18.860]  of divide and conquer balkanization so thank you Melissa Harris Perry whatever
[57:18.860 --> 57:23.100]  planet you really come from now before I end this hour as I barely plug for 15

[01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:30.060]  guests will be on with us Ethan and Oklahoma thanks for holding her on the
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:33.860]  year worldwide Ted Cruz surging ahead in at least one state against Trump
[01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:37.460]  Trump's gaining and leading other areas but they're now setting the two against
[01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:40.500]  each other tomorrow night's debate we'll have live coverage of that prison
[01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:45.620]  planet on TV in force nightly news he's and what do you think's going on here
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:52.540]  I think that the Republican National Committee is they realize that they can't
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:57.220]  tell Trump what to do so they're they're pushing Cruz so they want Cruz because
[01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:01.740]  they can tell him what to do because he can still be bought and Trump cannot
[01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:07.020]  well there's some talk about where he was born to try to disqualify him I don't
[01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:11.540]  see there's proof that Cruz can be bought but at the same time I just don't
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:15.260]  know him like I know Rand Paul I mean I would rather have a Rand Paul or Donald
[01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:19.020]  Trump people ask who do I support I'd take a Rand Paul or Donald Trump the
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:23.660]  problem is Rand Paul has not been aggressive enough with the advisors
[01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:29.300]  he's got and you know Trump I think is the guy now and I wish those two would
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:32.700]  make friends and you know maybe Rand Paul be vice president or something as he
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:36.420]  make a good vice president but I don't see him stepping down and I wish he
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:38.700]  wouldn't have attacked Trump so much because I know the two behind the scenes
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:43.580]  have played golf a few times and we're supposedly friends so it's all pretty
[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:48.260]  disgusting I hear you Ethan I appreciate your call let's go to Anthony in
[01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:54.020]  Florida Anthony in Florida you're on air go ahead how are you doing Alex did my
[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:59.380]  friend what do you think okay basically what I think I think it's funny that Ted
[01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:05.780]  Cruz Cruz is surgeon it smells fishy to me I don't know much about him but my
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:10.820]  more statement I want to make on is the fact that Donald Trump there these
[01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:15.820]  people against him are publicly being allowed to threaten his life and not
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:19.140]  there's no action they're not being prosecuted arrested there are
[01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:24.260]  Democrats and others saying kill him and it's okay if you remember when
[01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:29.220]  Obama was running for a second term a man made a statement oh if Obama gets
[01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:34.420]  elected president I'm gonna kill him they were at his door stepping arrested
[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:40.780]  listen boy I've had people say pretty mild stuff on our comment board and the
[01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:43.900]  Secret Service shows up here and that's fine one time I had a guy send me a
[01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:47.700]  letter saying he was gonna kill George W. Bush and all how he was planning to do
[01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:51.140]  it everything else I call the Secret Service they came over got the letter
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:54.580]  they arrested the guy in a house with all these weapons planning to kill Bush
[01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:58.340]  and even though I didn't like Bush I don't even any harm to come on him so you
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:00.580]  know I hear you they were usually respond to this stuff they're not been
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:05.860]  responding that's a good sign that how much they hate Trump and um there's a
[01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:10.980]  big thing about the um you know the taking our guns taking our guns and I
[01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:16.100]  think it goes back to the militia act of 1972 because we all know the Second
[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:20.300]  Amendment but the militia act where a pair of statues enacted by the Second
[01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:26.500]  United States Congress in 1792 1792 it provides for the organization of state
[01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:30.980]  militias and provided for the president of the United States to take command of
[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:35.260]  the militias in time absolutely and the militias are being federalized more and
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:38.100]  more but we need to you know get it back to its original state basis I
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:44.180]  appreciate your call let's talk to Mike in California on the KOMY 1340 a.m. go
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:49.860]  ahead you're on the air Mike yeah yeah my concern is it's really hard to get a
[01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:57.180]  deal for time now I was hoping that Rand would be able to talk right on your
[01:03:57.180 --> 01:04:02.180]  telephone talk right on your telephone yeah okay can you hear me better yeah
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:06.980]  go ahead okay my concern is that Ted could be a
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:12.660]  purpose venturing candidate that I don't have any deal behind him I'm hoping
[01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:18.940]  that Rand would break through to get his Trump on I agree that it could be
[01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:25.060]  Donald Rand Paul have to put his big boy pants on do that I agree and I guess
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:29.180]  the question that's really on my heart it should be the best chance candidate
[01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:33.300]  constitutional administration of the president of the United States I caught
[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:38.220]  most what you said the phone's pretty bad look we know that Ted Cruz Rand Paul
[01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:40.860]  and Donald Trump are all better than Hillary Clinton Bernie Sanders and
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:45.220]  Jeb Bush I'll take any one of them I'll take any one of them I mean obviously
[01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:49.020]  you can't always trust these people we've been betrayed too much but it just
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:52.900]  I'll take any one of them I just okay I like Trump the best now because he's a
[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:56.820]  hard charger he puts on big boy pants every morning not a little little
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:05:02.540]  short shorts despite all the status rhetoric that gun control works here's
[01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:05.740]  five reasons why it won't number one California has many of the most
[01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:09.780]  restrictive gun laws in the country yet those laws did absolutely nothing to
[01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:13.340]  stop the San Bernardino shooting number two Paris France also has some of the
[01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:16.700]  most restrictive gun laws in the world but those laws also did nothing to stop
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:20.700]  the November 13th ISIS attacks number three it's estimated that someone in
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:25.820]  Chicago is shot every 2.8 hours despite the city's strict gun laws number four
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:30.060]  Mexico also has restrictive gun laws just like Chicago yet over a hundred and
[01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:34.060]  sixty thousand people have been murdered in the country's drug war since 2007 the
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:37.620]  only people who are actually stopping the Mexican cartels or private citizens
[01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:42.100]  who are openly defined Mexico's gun laws to form self-defense malicious number
[01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:46.300]  five president Obama has been arming and funding ISIS link Syrian rebels for quite
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:50.140]  some time in fact Obama reproved the re-arming of the so-called moderate
[01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:54.140]  rebels on October 1st the same day he called for gun control in response to
[01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:57.460]  the community college shooting up in Oregon you can find out more info

[01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:54.620]  coming up later in this hour I'm gonna play an excerpt of a piece from the
[01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:59.380]  nightly news last week where Rob do and Richard Reeves talk about how the system
[01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:04.340]  plans to shoot down Donald Trump politically the American dream wrote a
[01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:09.420]  story similar to it today that kind of dovetails with the piece we put out last
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:13.380]  week how the Republican established we can keep Donald Trump from getting the
[01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:19.060]  nomination we probably to add our video that had the headline how Democrats
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:22.100]  have infiltrated the Republican Party and plan to steal the nomination from
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:27.540]  Donald Trump is our headline we should probably add a link at least to this new
[01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:33.780]  story today to the video that goes over the situation because I say it's
[01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:38.380]  Democrats that's basically what they are but we're gonna be getting to that
[01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:48.740]  report as well today in Paul Watson will be hosting the fourth hour as well I'm
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:54.260]  gonna go back to your phone calls but first Russia warrants Turkey over a

[01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:45.060]  join us here on air what do you think about Ted Cruz Donald Trump we've got
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:53.100]  Donald Trump going ahead in many polls around Iowa but not another areas of
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:57.020]  the country we have him surging there Trump is ahead in many polls around the
[01:10:57.020 --> 01:11:03.740]  country only gaining his lead politico is reporting Trump hits a new high in
[01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:07.660]  national poll the billionaire businessman surges the 41% after releasing
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:11.300]  proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the US which is popular even with
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:16.300]  two-thirds of Democrats Donald Trump got a little more of a vault in his
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:19.780]  ceiling nationwide the polling obsessed Manhattan multi-billionaire leading
[01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:23.580]  Republican presidential candidate broke into the 40s on Monday according to the
[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:28.980]  results of the latest university poll survey voters identifying as Republican
[01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:33.780]  or independence leaning towards the GOP Trump earned 41% nearly crippling the
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:40.540]  support of his closest rival senator Ted Cruz who took only 14% and that's the
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:47.860]  issue is that Cruz is not doing well except in Iowa but the media is making a
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:53.340]  huge deal out of this really to push him to the head so what do you think about
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:58.380]  Ted Cruz let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Texas Mike thanks for calling you're
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:00.820]  on the air
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:07.340]  well yep you're on the air welcome to the airwaves hey thank you honor to speak
[01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:12.740]  with you Alex I want to thank you and Dr. Ron Paul and the lake right there in
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:19.860]  Russo for waking me up and my thoughts on Ted Cruz are how can you trust a man
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:27.500]  like Ted Cruz when he posts on his Facebook account what an honor and it was
[01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:34.220]  to sit down and talk with the New World Order mouthpiece Henry Kissinger well I
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:37.900]  think clearly he's playing politics trying to be nice to those old king
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:43.500]  makers either to get elected try to save the country or he's one of them
[01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:50.180]  he's one of them personally and I liked him until I read that I had one concern
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:55.740]  about Donald Trump were recently read or saw that he was going to reauthorize the
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:58.420]  Patriot Act
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:05.460]  I know that he is a big law and order type guy and that's my big concern with
[01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:08.580]  him is talking about censoring the internet talking about draconian
[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:13.620]  police state measures to quote keep us safe they don't even use the NSA and the
[01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:17.060]  Patriot Act to stop these radicals coming in they know they're radical they
[01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:20.980]  let them in if the government would just do its job and not let people in from
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:24.220]  radical countries with radical backgrounds this wouldn't be happening and
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:28.020]  again the terror is not even that big a threat but they're gonna use it to take
[01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:32.620]  our liberties so that it has to be exposed it has to be stopped and we also
[01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:35.860]  have to expose the fact that they're using the terror to take our freedoms
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:40.660]  yes those are the problems I have with Donald Trump the next time he's on the
[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:43.660]  next time one of my reporters talks to him on the campaign trail we're gonna
[01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:47.380]  bring up some of those issues but I've talked to a lot of his advisors and
[01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:50.020]  other people and they say that obviously he's not gonna censor the general
[01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:54.220]  public's internet he means in those countries where ISIS is operating so
[01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:58.420]  they can't spread their videos their material of snuff films and I don't
[01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:02.820]  think these al-qaeda ISIS videos where they have 10-year-old kids blowing
[01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:06.940]  people's heads off graphically in HD that should not be on the internet that
[01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:14.060]  is a snuff film of a murder now they don't censor that but they'll censor if I
[01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:17.740]  show an Apache helicopter blowing up a Reuters van well that shouldn't be
[01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:22.020]  censored because it's not a deliberate snuff film and you don't see people up
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:26.780]  close dying you know with blood coming out of their eyes it's just absolutely
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:32.500]  out of control so I hear what you're saying any other concerns Mike
[01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:38.020]  no I just say peace not war and love not hate God bless you appreciate you
[01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:42.780]  calling today we're gonna go to James in a moment from California I just want to
[01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:47.620]  say this I don't believe in lesser of two evils but if someone is a maverick and
[01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:51.460]  someone wants to defend the Second Amendment defend our sovereignty not
[01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:56.340]  have the ban on coal power plants cut our taxes on industry where jobs come
[01:14:56.340 --> 01:14:59.740]  back here get rid of the loopholes where foreign corporations can go overseas
[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:05.420]  and not pay taxes everything he is doing is basically like cutting ropes on a
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:09.500]  hot-air balloon you cut those ropes the balloon will rise or it's like a boat at
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:13.900]  a dock tied up to the dock and the boat might be strong enough to pull the dock
[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:17.660]  away and drag it through the lake but at a certain point it's gonna sink under
[01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:20.980]  and your boat's gonna be basically tied up and won't be able to travel anymore
[01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:28.060]  until you cut the rope of the chain and we know Hillary's evil we know Bernie
[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:32.500]  Sanders is super evil we know Jeff Bush is a total fraud and super bad news and
[01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:37.780]  so I will not support a general election Hillary Clinton or Jeff Bush and I
[01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:42.100]  would support at that time a third-party run for Donald Trump even if he lost
[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:45.540]  just because he would educate people it's the right thing to do and I'm not
[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:49.460]  going the lesser two evils in fact a jet bush would make conservatives go to
[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:53.340]  sleep he finished the whole globalist agenda Hillary getting in after eight
[01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:57.460]  years of Obama no matter what she tried she'd be scandal-ridden she'd be in
[01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:02.220]  peach she'd be destroyed now I don't want that to happen because I believe
[01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:09.580]  justice be done may the heavens fall that's what I believe in and so do the
[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:17.420]  right thing no matter what you go for the best candidate well some of them
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:22.180]  aren't obviously perfect I don't completely trust Ted Cruz Rand Paul has
[01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:27.700]  just been to milk toast and I know he's a good guy for real and a patriot I don't
[01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:31.340]  completely trust Donald Trump not that I think he's even a bad guy he's just a
[01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:36.500]  wild man all better than Hillary Clinton all better than Jeff Bush all better
[01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:43.580]  than Bernie Sanders I mean I know these are bad people I know them well and so
[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:48.500]  there is no lesser two evils here it's a clear choice that those three
[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:53.300]  Republicans hands down I mean Huckabee's not even perfect he's better than
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:17:00.020]  Hillary because they don't have a fundamental wish to destroy this country
[01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:04.500]  and enslave us they like the status quo pretty much the good old boy system
[01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:08.220]  which isn't perfect but you know they don't want to get rid of all of America's
[01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:12.860]  jobs and you do deals with China so we have nothing I mean the globalist want
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:18.300]  to bring this country down for world government and it's one thing if Cruz
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:23.460]  gives lip service to globalist which he does or Donald Trump does because if you
[01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:29.300]  don't at least go sit with these dragons Bush senior people like that they
[01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:37.460]  will send people after you so I mean use Ted Cruz patronizing when he says
[01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:41.700]  honored to share a few moments with Dr. Kissinger and hear his thoughts on the
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:49.020]  challenges facing our nation is that pet in the dragon's belly I would meet with
[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:54.020]  Henry Kissinger and I would say globalism is not stabilize the world it
[01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:59.020]  is a form of conquest and your greatest crime is dumbing people down and that's
[01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:04.060]  why I reject your entire system do you want to repent of it and try to come
[01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:08.380]  out with any regrets you have near the end of your life with a way to make
[01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:11.820]  globalism be more altruistic and try to reverse what it's done before it destroys
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:16.620]  the world you want to be more like Joseph Sticklets or Jimmy Carter who
[01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:20.620]  aren't perfect but compared to Henry Kissinger they're angel cakes he is a
[01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:28.300]  war criminal James in California thanks for holding her on the ear hi yes sir
[01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:32.700]  hi so I'm gonna start off with Isaiah 45 16 they shall be ashamed and also
[01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:36.940]  confounded all of them they shall go into confusion together that are makers of
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:41.660]  idols I was don't do not make Ted Cruz or Donald Trump into an idol you will be
[01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:46.380]  confused by them I see Donald Trump is being a cast son in co-intel operation
[01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:50.300]  on you I think that what he is put there to do is bring in the police state just
[01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:54.380]  like Ted Cruz they're both to bring him a police state neither one of them will
[01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:58.180]  stop the police state they will not stop the police state he will order version
[01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:03.140]  of the police state so we can't look to them to be our idols in this sense we
[01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:08.780]  will just be confused when that's the shit let him go and let him go delete

[01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:10.580]  in for thousands that they let in there won't be one or two Christians that's
[01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:15.180]  because they're not part of the club I mean you don't think our government
[01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:20.300]  launched an attack at Syria to kill 200,000 Christians so far because they
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:24.580]  love them do you or to kill all the Christians in Libya the black Christians
[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:29.300]  and others I mean that's the whole plan to persecute Christians worldwide look
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:35.300]  at the persecution of Christians now in this country that's the whole game plan
[01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:41.660]  and the persecution of the family and everything else I'm gonna cover news the
[01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:44.340]  next segment continue with calls but right now let's go back to your calls
[01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:49.620]  Duke in Oklahoma what do you think about Ted Cruz rising in the Iowa polls
[01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:56.420]  surging ahead of Donald Trump Trump gaining leads in national polls well I
[01:25:56.420 --> 01:26:00.900]  like his sternness and that's what I think we need if somebody with a little
[01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:07.220]  bit of sternness right now that actually can can fight for exactly what they say
[01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:13.180]  and I think Ted Cruz is very strong I've always listened to his voice and how he
[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:17.620]  talks about it what what he wants to do and he's strong he is the most
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:21.900]  presidential of all of them hands down he's the slickest the best he's the
[01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:27.860]  most statesman like yes absolutely you know Rand Paul I prayed Rand Paul would
[01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:33.540]  come out strong I prayed he would fight with his words he just never did it and
[01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:38.980]  maybe that maybe he still will he hasn't done it thus far yeah it's really hard
[01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:43.340]  to believe because I know he can be more fiery than this more fiery than his
[01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:48.020]  father too I mean his dad would be fighting harder than this right now he
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:51.820]  just I mean I'm just calling it like it is like I'm a fan of a football team and
[01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:55.460]  they fall on their face you gotta say whoa they blow it and he is blowing it
[01:26:55.460 --> 01:27:00.500]  man he's got a bunch of advisors that I have to know or just dumber in a box of
[01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:07.980]  rocks you know we've got Donald Trump yeah I like some of the stuff he says he
[01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:13.940]  seems like a man that will do some things that we need but do I see him
[01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:17.700]  sticking up for the little guys well I've seen him you know kick a few little
[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:23.220]  guys down I still like the guy I just don't know if he's gonna give us exactly
[01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:26.460]  what we need are we gonna be right back to square one whenever he becomes
[01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:31.260]  president you tell me well I think we will be back to square one if the
[01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:35.620]  president doesn't know how to deal with Congress and the people don't know how
[01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:40.620]  to deal with Congress and pressure them with recalls you name it to actually vet
[01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:45.460]  the spending bills to actually exert lawmaking power over the courts and over
[01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:52.660]  the executive Congress is the most broke leg crooked leg creation it's ever been
[01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:58.340]  and it's advocated it's it's it's handed over its authority and that's why we're
[01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:05.820]  in so much turmoil is because they have engaged in that abdication they have
[01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:09.460]  turned over their their rightful authority when the Federal Reserve is
[01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:13.380]  up on TV and says Congress cannot even touch us or make laws we're above them
[01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:16.060]  with a fourth branch of government and then it's private and that's a total
[01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:19.660]  fraud Congress controls the issuance of currency and credit and then Congress
[01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:22.860]  wanted to stand up and say how dare you we're gonna audit you I mean it's just
[01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:29.100]  it's just ridiculous what do you think well you know I think there's the most
[01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:32.780]  important election in our history and I think the election after this election
[01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:36.860]  will be the most important election in in history I think the next two elections
[01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:41.180]  will be the deciding factor of what really happens and that what things
[01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:45.460]  become in this country I agree well not just here worldwide the globalists are
[01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:49.660]  on the March the ring race worldwide are riding they are taking countries down

[01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:05.140]  it's being used restrict people's free speech we have a gentleman joining us who
[01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:09.780]  founded the British Defense League and became a very fast-growing party that
[01:37:09.780 --> 01:37:13.540]  got infiltrated by racist and taken over he got out of it so he has the white
[01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:18.700]  supremacist and the radical Muslims after him Tommy Robinson will be joining
[01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:24.100]  us enemy of the state is the new DVD and book and it deals with the fact that he
[01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:27.740]  gets arrested basically going on anywhere giving a speech he's not allowed
[01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:32.220]  to talk that's how incredible the leftist censorship is so whether you
[01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:35.500]  agree with him or disagree or agree with part of it look at LePen she's like
[01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:39.900]  milk toast Rand Paul and I don't mean that meanly but she's well-spoken nice
[01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:43.300]  friendly there's a radical Muslim invasion and it threatens our sovereignty
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:48.740]  to the greatest extent since World War two boom arrested they said you will not
[01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:53.780]  compare Islam to Nazism even though most of Islam join with the Nazis in World
[01:37:53.780 --> 01:38:00.780]  War two I mean it's just a fact and again I don't have Islamophobia folks for
[01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:03.380]  about 30 40% of Islam I've studied it deeply
[01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:07.700]  Islam said periods where it was more enlightened than Christendom I mean you
[01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:12.340]  can look that up Christendom's been just as bad just as crazy just as evil in
[01:38:12.340 --> 01:38:16.180]  some respects but it wasn't really Christianity we'll all say fine you want
[01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:19.260]  to say Islam isn't that's fine
[01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:27.100]  Wahhabism is dominating Shiite systems and taking it over and Wahhabism is
[01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:35.100]  controlling the entire Sunni system now and so it's 79% of Islam being taken
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:39.460]  over by a radical sect within it funded by Saudi Arabia and the West working
[01:38:39.460 --> 01:38:42.940]  with it and arming it and you see the West joined with the most aggressive
[01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:48.700]  militaristic dominant form of Islam in a civil war worldwide to bring down other
[01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:53.020]  Islamic groups and clear out Christians part of the deal they've signed with
[01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:59.860]  Saudi Arabia it is a policy to murder every Christian Saudi Arabia finds on
[01:38:59.860 --> 01:39:06.340]  record and you can go there if you're an oil company exec or whatever you just
[01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:10.540]  stay in your Western sector you do not go out your wife does not show her face
[01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:14.540]  if she lives there and you do not get caught with alcohol and you do not get
[01:39:14.540 --> 01:39:21.100]  anything or you will be put in prison or executed you go out of street corner and
[01:39:21.100 --> 01:39:25.260]  preach about Jesus Christ they will beat the living snot out of you on the spot
[01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:30.700]  take you to jail torture the daylights out of you until you confess and then
[01:39:30.700 --> 01:39:33.820]  they'll roll you in front of a tribunal of clerics and they will put you in jail
[01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:39.300]  for years if you're lucky if you don't have special interests behind you you
[01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:47.620]  will spend life in slave labor in one of their presence and we're just supposed
[01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:58.700]  to just just oh we love this culture this is a evil culture evil the Nazis
[01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:03.300]  were an evil culture the Aztecs became an evil culture the tribes before them
[01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:06.980]  had very limited human sacrifice they've dug into the ground it was done on
[01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:10.900]  select times of the year it was whacked out like other cultures all of the world
[01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:14.420]  did the same thing basically they've mainly killed nobility royalty stuff
[01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:17.940]  like that as offerings then it became kill the neighboring tribes and the
[01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:24.700]  Aztecs basically depopulated what is Mexico today in Guatemala they would go
[01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:29.780]  as far as a thousand miles away into Central America down into South America
[01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:33.700]  to get slaves to bring back and kill because they had killed millions of
[01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:37.660]  people over 400 500 a year reign they had they had run out of people so they
[01:40:37.660 --> 01:40:45.300]  would go capture entire cultures tens of thousands and haul them back as slaves
[01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:54.940]  to kill them and eat them kill them and eat them that's the priest class and I
[01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:58.260]  had Mayan archaeologists with degrees take me on the special tours when I was
[01:40:58.260 --> 01:41:07.140]  a kid and last year and these are Mayans telling you and what on it it's a
[01:41:07.140 --> 01:41:10.140]  fact folks in the media that you also get a politically correct when you see
[01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:12.900]  like a white tour guide I'm not kidding they'll go it's not true there were
[01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:16.620]  sacrifices the Aztecs were loving you'll be good and they'll be like that's
[01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:19.820]  woman crazy you're gonna come with me and just you know go over the whole deal
[01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:25.140]  it's a fact that whenever the conquistadors just a couple hundred of
[01:41:25.140 --> 01:41:28.860]  them showed up they could conquer Mexico City that was hundreds of thousands
[01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:34.700]  of people and you know why they had executed basically almost everybody they
[01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:40.540]  had killed almost everybody I mean it was just it was just crazy town the
[01:41:40.540 --> 01:41:45.060]  conquistadors showed up and just was like what the they had down below each
[01:41:45.060 --> 01:41:49.180]  table that he sacrificed they have a open-air market with all these pillars
[01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:52.940]  that had a roof and they would hang people from those and that was the main
[01:41:52.940 --> 01:42:00.740]  priest class money was shelling meat to the middle class and the meat was
[01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:07.220]  people directly out of Tulsa dooms cave and cut in the barbarian but not a
[01:42:07.220 --> 01:42:16.340]  fiction movie and it was that blacked out the people are on so many hallucinogens
[01:42:16.340 --> 01:42:19.620]  so whacked out of their brains that they just basically surrendered to the
[01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:29.420]  conquistadors and when I say evil culture radical Islam is basically as far as
[01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:33.940]  I'm concerned a satanic religion I mean if you want to talk about satanic

[01:44:27.340 --> 01:44:33.060]  classroom in the kindergarten in the northern suburb of Abervillars when the
[01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:36.300]  armed assailant burst in around 730 local time according to the prosecutor
[01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:40.260]  prior to the attack the man used another name for Islamic State pull the

[01:44:44.220 --> 01:44:47.340]  in the side of the throat
[01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:57.700]  this story is up on drugs report dot com that let's just punch that up for
[01:44:57.700 --> 01:45:02.180]  folks it's on the right hand side and we'll just click on that I can show
[01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:12.340]  people hundreds of refugees caught with images of ISIS flags severed heads on
[01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:18.500]  their phones well it's the culture I mean why not let them cut you your daughters
[01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:26.220]  that offer son police raise alarm about asylum seekers entering Norway
[01:45:26.220 --> 01:45:30.540]  authorities have discovered images of ISIS flags and severed heads on these
[01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:40.460]  cell phones of hundreds of asylum seekers crossing into Norway into Europe
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:43.980]  how many concerns about terrorists exploiting the migrant crisis to
[01:45:43.980 --> 01:45:47.900]  infiltrate jihadist into Europe and we know that's happened
[01:45:51.380 --> 01:45:55.060]  the news in Europe is reporting an explosion of refugees crossing in the
[01:45:55.060 --> 01:46:00.740]  country in recent months meant that police immigration service pu had to
[01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:04.380]  register the migrants quickly for the report after searching luggage and
[01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:07.220]  mobile phones belonging to migrants notice that Switzerland's they're telling
[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:10.180]  you what's on their phones or else they won't police have logged hundreds of
[01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:13.300]  examples of photos and videos of executions and brutal punishments
[01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:17.020]  those images of people holding up severed heads and hands authorities
[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:20.500]  also discovered numerous examples of ISIS flags and symbols belong to other
[01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:26.900]  terrorist organizations Eric Hoogland head of Norway's asylum program said
[01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:31.700]  that the images may be on the phones for innocent reasons but that some
[01:46:31.700 --> 01:46:35.900]  individuals have likely downloaded the photos because they supported or were
[01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:41.220]  affiliated with terrorist groups so we've got Norway we've got Switzerland
[01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:46.540]  others saying they're finding this on the phones earlier this month the newly
[01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:50.020]  uncovered ISIS manifesto bragged about how the terror organization was
[01:46:50.020 --> 01:46:53.660]  planning on exploiting refugee program to infiltrate jihadist into Europe and
[01:46:53.660 --> 01:47:00.660]  sent up radicalization muslim ghettos in major cities let's stop right there it
[01:47:00.660 --> 01:47:06.540]  was in February just just search ISIS promises to send
[01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:12.900]  migrant wave or immigration wave into Europe filled with ISIS they said it it
[01:47:12.900 --> 01:47:16.700]  was proclaimed by their leader it was put out in online orders now it's in a
[01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:21.140]  battle plan given to the people how to do it so you even have the blueprint
[01:47:21.140 --> 01:47:28.380]  there it is there is the report from February 16th February 18th this year
[01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:33.580]  ISIS threatens to send 500,000 migrants well I guess they quadruple their
[01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:39.020]  promise as a psychological weapon in shilling echo of Qaddafi's prophecy that
[01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:43.460]  the Mediterranean will become a sea of chaos but now there's a new ISIS
[01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:47.340]  manifesto linked up on infowars.com and dredgerport.com earlier this month the
[01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:51.500]  newly uncovered ISIS manifesto bragged about how the terror organization was
[01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:54.340]  planning on exploiting the refugee program to infiltrate jihadist into
[01:47:54.340 --> 01:48:00.940]  Europe and set up a radicalized muslim ghettos in major cities at least three
[01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:05.540]  individuals who poses refugees have now been connected to the 13th of Paris
[01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:08.700]  attack including the mastermind behind the plot
[01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:15.060]  Durkha Durkha Muhammad Jihad Abdel Ahmad Amado Blago Snago or whatever his name
[01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:20.060]  is who brazenly revealed how he exploited the migrant red carpet to plot
[01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:27.380]  bloodshed. Earlier this month an 18 year old asylum seeker who was arrested in the
[01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:30.780]  Netherlands after he reportedly told other refugees that he fought alongside
[01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:41.420]  al Qaeda and ISIS in Syria but it's okay because we can open up the borders we
[01:48:41.420 --> 01:48:47.020]  can open up the borders and just let whoever they want into the country and
[01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:51.540]  then Melissa Harris Perry says her name is supposed to show Malik in her burqa

[01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:38.380]  engineers the social controllers the transhumanist hygienists openly say
[01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:42.900]  humanity's time has come to end and that they decided to direct the
[01:54:42.900 --> 01:54:48.700]  development of society of the culture of the technological systems to become
[01:54:48.700 --> 01:54:51.700]  basically a technological terror to quote Darth Vader since we're on that
[01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:56.980]  subject to dominate and control all fastest human life to make humanity
[01:54:56.980 --> 01:55:02.540]  exempt so the decision has been made to build the architecture in this way if we
[01:55:02.540 --> 01:55:06.500]  simply vote with our dollars before the architecture is complete and build the
[01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:11.460]  architecture the way we want to it will be empowering but the ultimate
[01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:17.060]  selfishness of the globalist is to basically end all of that there's another

[02:01:44.980 --> 02:01:54.300]  Kurt Russell blast gun control push I think it's absolutely insane man I was
[02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:56.740]  just thinking about Kurt Russell a few weeks ago I had to see escape from New
[02:01:56.740 --> 02:02:03.220]  York in like a decade now let my son watch it was his 13 and after the girls
[02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:06.820]  went to bed one night let him stay up late with me and he was like this is
[02:02:06.820 --> 02:02:10.300]  really good and I was like yeah this is old-fashioned stuff old-fashioned action
[02:02:10.300 --> 02:02:13.780]  and I was like yeah I remember getting told he was a Listern but it was almost
[02:02:13.780 --> 02:02:17.260]  like it's vague is like six years ago I was like I just know he's a patriot I
[02:02:17.260 --> 02:02:21.220]  need to get him on and then you see something like that it's just so good
[02:02:21.220 --> 02:02:24.740]  to know there's so many you love an actor and you don't want to see him be a
[02:02:24.740 --> 02:02:30.140]  piece of garbage you know this is wonderful JR in the great state of
[02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:36.220]  Tejas thank you for holding sir yes sir I'm down here in Austin having that from
[02:02:36.220 --> 02:02:44.860]  Sue Ellen but I don't hear anybody bringing up like we did with the old
[02:02:44.860 --> 02:02:53.340]  mama being born somewhere else and he was born in Canada you know with the US
[02:02:53.340 --> 02:03:00.780]  mama and the Cuban daddy and hell he had dual citizenship until last year well
[02:03:00.780 --> 02:03:05.060]  I think Obama avoided that but of course it really was born in Hawaii that was all
[02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:09.820]  big shill to get us away from who his dearly dad was the top communist basically
[02:03:09.820 --> 02:03:13.780]  in the country for the KGB you can't make that up it's he admits he's to live
[02:03:13.780 --> 02:03:17.060]  with him I mean it's like it's like hiding in plain view Frank Marshall Davis
[02:03:17.060 --> 02:03:23.780]  live with him for 10 years pretty much on the summers but with Cruz the law is
[02:03:23.780 --> 02:03:30.820]  pretty clear though that if his mother was the US citizen and then they claim it
[02:03:30.820 --> 02:03:34.260]  at birth I don't get the law back in front of me but doesn't that mean that
[02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:40.860]  Cruz could be president or am I wrong I don't know I just know that it seems to
[02:03:40.860 --> 02:03:47.100]  me about the same thing with Obama but we know his dad was an anti-communist
[02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:52.980]  from Cuba that's a lot better than Frank Marshall Davis KGB officer I was
[02:03:52.980 --> 02:03:59.900]  wondering also do we know anything about I know I read a year to go about I'm not
[02:03:59.900 --> 02:04:05.460]  bashing Cruz I like him I wish we had no I know it's important to ask questions
[02:04:05.460 --> 02:04:10.620]  sir you're absolutely right I'm glad you brought that up about I read where he
[02:04:10.620 --> 02:04:15.820]  was I guess one of the lawyers that helped write the that North American
[02:04:15.820 --> 02:04:21.420]  Treaty that Bush signed with Felipe Fox in the Canadian first yeah there were a
[02:04:21.420 --> 02:04:24.580]  bunch of lawyers involved he reportedly was part of one there were thousands
[02:04:24.580 --> 02:04:28.820]  involved but he was reportedly involved in some sections of it and that and you
[02:04:28.820 --> 02:04:33.380]  know Donald Trump should bring that up to it the Trump sitting after and getting
[02:04:33.380 --> 02:04:38.660]  all that's a bad idea also I had one more thing for you that I've come to
[02:04:38.660 --> 02:04:44.740]  realize that common sense equals racism that is a good bumper sticker
[02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:49.740]  absolutely well we know Darth Vader's now racist sir I mean MSNBC said it it's
[02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:53.220]  true and if you don't agree with her you're a racist Melissa Harris Perry is
[02:04:53.220 --> 02:05:01.020]  basically the oracle I mean she is truth incarnate in response of Donald Trump's
[02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:04.300]  proposal to ban non-citizen Muslims from entering the US without being
[02:05:04.300 --> 02:05:07.620]  properly vetted Senate Democrats may attempt to create a so-called civil
[02:05:07.620 --> 02:05:12.220]  right for anyone including ISIS militants to immigrate to the US Senator
[02:05:12.220 --> 02:05:16.100]  Pat Leigh a Democrat from Vermont proposed an amendment to Title 18 of the
[02:05:16.100 --> 02:05:19.540]  US code to stop the federal government from banning individuals from entering
[02:05:19.540 --> 02:05:23.100]  into the United States based on their religion which would create a dangerous
[02:05:23.100 --> 02:05:26.460]  precedent where illegal aliens could claim immigration laws preventing their
[02:05:26.460 --> 02:05:30.540]  entry into the US violate their civil rights in response to the amendment
[02:05:30.540 --> 02:05:34.180]  Republican Senators Jeff session said quote it is a move towards the
[02:05:34.180 --> 02:05:38.500]  ratification of the idea that global migration is a so-called human right and
[02:05:38.500 --> 02:05:41.620]  that these so-called immigrants rights must be supreme to the rights of
[02:05:41.620 --> 02:05:45.380]  sovereign nations determine who can and cannot enter their borders sessions
[02:05:45.380 --> 02:05:49.780]  also warrant that any alien denied entry could file suits demand entry and

[02:10:55.580 --> 02:11:02.500]  folks have gotten and the fact that they are not integrating with society well
[02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:09.060]  yeah we visited mollambique in Belgium a few weeks ago now to check on reports
[02:11:09.060 --> 02:11:13.420]  that this was the jihadist capital of Europe that's what it was called the
[02:11:13.420 --> 02:11:17.940]  left for a long time and it cropped up again recently last week with the whole
[02:11:17.940 --> 02:11:23.020]  ban Trump controversy claim that this is a conspiracy theory that these Muslim
[02:11:23.020 --> 02:11:26.940]  ghettos where these terrorists are radicalized even exist and in fact
[02:11:26.940 --> 02:11:31.620]  Boris Johnson the mayor of London came out and said these areas don't exist I
[02:11:31.620 --> 02:11:35.820]  invite mr. Trump to come over and visit and I will walk around with him to show
[02:11:35.820 --> 02:11:39.940]  him that these areas are completely safe of course he will if I ever happened he
[02:11:39.940 --> 02:11:46.380]  would be surrounded by 20 news cameras and about 15 cops so of course any area
[02:11:46.380 --> 02:11:50.340]  in that situation is going to be relatively safe we went into mollambique
[02:11:50.340 --> 02:11:55.620]  on our own just as it was getting dark and we were basically harassed
[02:11:55.620 --> 02:11:59.860]  discriminated against racially and chased out of there again proving that
[02:11:59.860 --> 02:12:04.740]  these Muslim no-go areas by cars thrown out of restaurants thrown out of
[02:12:04.740 --> 02:12:09.340]  convenience stores could not get service at open businesses they said not for
[02:12:09.340 --> 02:12:14.940]  you and begin screaming it out exactly but of course Tommy Robinson has been
[02:12:14.940 --> 02:12:20.340]  facing this and speaking out against it for a lot longer than I have so if you
[02:12:20.340 --> 02:12:23.580]  could introduce him that'd be good to get absolutely mr. Robinson I mean I
[02:12:23.580 --> 02:12:26.580]  don't know where to start with a saga that you've been through for folks that
[02:12:26.580 --> 02:12:30.700]  don't know it's been the next five minutes or so for our US audience and
[02:12:30.700 --> 02:12:38.220]  others exactly what you've been through so I started in 2000 and in 2004 I held
[02:12:38.220 --> 02:12:41.980]  the first demonstration I organized when I was when I was 21 years old that was
[02:12:41.980 --> 02:12:45.980]  against a group called al-Majrideen I'd seen them in my hometown radicalizing
[02:12:45.980 --> 02:12:50.060]  recruiting this was before 77 before any terrorist attacks on our shores I started
[02:12:50.060 --> 02:12:54.700]  reading to this group and understanding the ideology that has spawned ISIS I've
[02:12:54.700 --> 02:12:58.420]  become alarmed and concerned so I organized my first demonstration the
[02:12:58.420 --> 02:13:01.900]  response to that as a young 21 year old I was attacked my house was attacked and
[02:13:01.900 --> 02:13:06.580]  I had to go into hiding for a little while and that and five years later our
[02:13:06.580 --> 02:13:09.900]  soldiers were parading through my hometown of Luton when you talk about
[02:13:09.900 --> 02:13:13.740]  Mullenbeek I'll talk about Luton Luton has been named by the COA I believe it's
[02:13:13.740 --> 02:13:17.420]  the epicenter of European terrorist activity we had the Stockholm bomber we
[02:13:17.420 --> 02:13:20.940]  had the fertilizer bomb plot the seven seven bombers come and took their bombs
[02:13:20.940 --> 02:13:24.900]  from Luton and boarded the train in Luton we've had numerous just last week
[02:13:24.900 --> 02:13:28.900]  and other four Muslims arrested on terrorist plot in Britain in Luton so
[02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:35.060]  I've grown up seeing the town change in my hometown there's 30 mosques there's
[02:13:35.060 --> 02:13:41.060]  40 to 50,000 Muslims we're a small town I've seen the effect of it I've had a
[02:13:41.060 --> 02:13:43.700]  I don't know if you've heard of the sexual grooming which should be referred
[02:13:43.700 --> 02:13:48.820]  to as rape G had I had a cousin who was victim of that and I've lived it for my
[02:13:48.820 --> 02:13:53.060]  whole life now when the final straw was the soldiers homecoming parade when our
[02:13:53.060 --> 02:13:55.380]  soldiers were parading through our hometown and they were attacked there
[02:13:55.380 --> 02:13:59.900]  were spat they were called butchers of bazaar baby killers murderers one of the
[02:13:59.900 --> 02:14:04.980]  soldiers mums a spanner face and that was the final straw now that that spawned
[02:14:04.980 --> 02:14:08.260]  and get birthed to a group called the United People of Luton with which
[02:14:08.260 --> 02:14:12.020]  therefore turned into the English Defense League I was 26 years old and
[02:14:12.020 --> 02:14:14.820]  within six months I was leading the biggest street protest movement you're
[02:14:14.820 --> 02:14:20.420]  at sea and we made mistakes regrettably but at the same time what we managed to
[02:14:20.420 --> 02:14:24.380]  do was bring to the forefront and bring to discussion all of the negative
[02:14:24.380 --> 02:14:27.940]  problems that we see in our communities whether that be sexual grooming which
[02:14:27.940 --> 02:14:32.260]  had been suppressed and hidden a conspiracy of silence with Muslim
[02:14:32.260 --> 02:14:36.820]  leaders political leaders social services politicians they all conspired to
[02:14:36.820 --> 02:14:40.460]  allow and facilitate the rape of our youth and our girls and for those that
[02:14:40.460 --> 02:14:44.660]  don't know you talked about this 10 years ago and now it's come out that the
[02:14:44.660 --> 02:14:48.700]  CPS the police have been ordered in that some cases thousands of young girls
[02:14:48.700 --> 02:14:52.060]  being kidnapped and raped but because Muslims are doing it they're they're
[02:14:52.060 --> 02:14:55.740]  saying they are above the law that's actually now a decade after you first
[02:14:55.740 --> 02:14:59.740]  talked about it that's now been proven in mainstream British news yeah we've
[02:14:59.740 --> 02:15:02.900]  been vindicated to be honest six years ago politically is very different
[02:15:02.900 --> 02:15:05.820]  landscape in Britain when we first come out talking about these issues we were
[02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:09.940]  called extreme is simply for highlight six years on we've been vindicated we've
[02:15:09.940 --> 02:15:13.100]  been proven right about everything we're saying there were genuine concerns and
[02:15:13.100 --> 02:15:16.220]  fears in our community where we live not where the politicians would live but
[02:15:16.220 --> 02:15:20.060]  where we live and you're right in one town there's 1,400 children raped 1,400
[02:15:20.060 --> 02:15:24.420]  girls rape pass around by gangs and gangs of Muslim men and who are allowed to do
[02:15:24.420 --> 02:15:28.420]  so by the police by the council by the government and that there should be a
[02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:32.100]  warning to the world about how powerful political correctness is that's how
[02:15:32.100 --> 02:15:35.940]  powerful it is they will stand by and watch young girls be raped and for those
[02:15:35.940 --> 02:15:38.820]  that don't know in these more radical Muslim cultures like out of Saudi
[02:15:38.820 --> 02:15:42.820]  Arabia there is women are property enslaved men are allowed to rape the
[02:15:42.820 --> 02:15:48.420]  women and the women speak out they get executed for being raped so that's why
[02:15:48.420 --> 02:15:51.860]  you see all these imams saying we're coming we're gonna get your women we're
[02:15:51.860 --> 02:15:57.420]  gonna jihad them this is a open tenant by you know top I mean head imams in
[02:15:57.420 --> 02:16:01.500]  Jerusalem Australia it's really crazy they actually say on tape we're coming
[02:16:01.500 --> 02:16:04.860]  to get your women you can't stop us and now in Europe it's happening and the
[02:16:04.860 --> 02:16:08.700]  police are being ordered to cover it up I mean some German towns of a hundred
[02:16:08.700 --> 02:16:13.220]  have had 700 Islamists brought in it's gonna be much worse than England what
[02:16:13.220 --> 02:16:16.820]  do you expect that to be like I've been to Germany I've recently traveled around
[02:16:16.820 --> 02:16:20.940]  Europe meeting with I met with Pagida Pagida is the organization that formed
[02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:25.100]  12 months ago in Dresden when I went to speak at their rally there was 40,000
[02:16:25.100 --> 02:16:29.380]  concerned Germans there in some city that you talk about in one town with a
[02:16:29.380 --> 02:16:34.460]  population of 13,000 they're put 8,000 Muslim men refugee so-called refugees
[02:16:34.460 --> 02:16:38.100]  in another town with population of 3,000 they're put two and a half thousand
[02:16:38.100 --> 02:16:41.740]  overnight their towns have been taken over their women are having to stay in
[02:16:41.740 --> 02:16:46.940]  the house we've seen rapes from from so-called refugees from five Syrians
[02:16:46.940 --> 02:16:53.140]  in England we've seen in Sweden we've seen in Germany multiple
[02:16:53.140 --> 02:16:57.380]  multiple times have these so-called refugees been raping the host nation's
[02:16:57.380 --> 02:17:01.540]  women now this is this is we need to realize the street level G had a rape
[02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:07.620]  G had has been going on in Britain 90% 90% of the street level grooming gang
[02:17:07.620 --> 02:17:14.220]  convictions are Muslim men 90% only 4% of our country is Muslim and that's not
[02:17:14.220 --> 02:17:18.660]  all men only 4% Muslims I say 2% of Muslim men they're responsible for 90%
[02:17:18.660 --> 02:17:22.740]  of the convictions for grooming gangs 20% of those men are called Mohammed we
[02:17:22.740 --> 02:17:26.460]  have a serious problem and and simply what what what I've had what we face
[02:17:26.460 --> 02:17:30.580]  the same simply speaking out I think when people when people listen to the
[02:17:30.580 --> 02:17:34.780]  full story of what we've gone through and what the state and the government and
[02:17:34.780 --> 02:17:38.100]  the police have done not just to myself but to other members and other people who
[02:17:38.100 --> 02:17:42.020]  have tried to voice their concerns people will be shocked to realize that we
[02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:45.220]  all think we live in a democracy with freedom of speech we think we have these
[02:17:45.220 --> 02:17:49.900]  these God-given rights we don't you try and exercise and you realize you don't
[02:17:49.900 --> 02:17:54.540]  and what what America needs to understand and they need to get ready for
[02:17:54.540 --> 02:17:57.500]  is everything that's happening here everything that's happened here is
[02:17:57.500 --> 02:18:02.980]  coming to America I want to go to break come back at Paul's brief response and
[02:18:02.980 --> 02:18:05.380]  then you're welcome to even ride into the next hour whether you have the time
[02:18:05.380 --> 02:18:07.980]  we have successful reports to be airing as well at the bottom of that hour but
[02:18:07.980 --> 02:18:13.980]  your story you know just just following it is so over the top that in most
[02:18:13.980 --> 02:18:17.820]  countries you'd be considered you know pretty moderate but the way they spun
[02:18:17.820 --> 02:18:21.100]  it the way they infiltrated how they treated you the way you've been arrested
[02:18:21.100 --> 02:18:23.340]  where you're not even allowed to go out and demonstrate or give a speech in
[02:18:23.340 --> 02:18:26.420]  public I mean this is so draconian but I want to ask you this question we got
[02:18:26.420 --> 02:18:30.380]  about a minute and a half why do you think the West wants to do this why
[02:18:30.380 --> 02:18:33.620]  would they want to bring in the most radical incompatible pretty much
[02:18:33.620 --> 02:18:40.780]  dark-age cultures to and then let them have a free hand what is the point it's
[02:18:40.780 --> 02:18:44.540]  complete population replacement that's that's what we're seeing look forget the
[02:18:44.540 --> 02:18:49.020]  refugee crisis if we didn't have the refugee crisis we already face
[02:18:49.020 --> 02:18:53.460]  drastic drastic times ahead of us without the refugee crisis that ignore the
[02:18:53.460 --> 02:18:57.060]  refugee crisis we have got Muslim ghettos across this country we've got a
[02:18:57.060 --> 02:19:01.860]  population of simply only 4% but every 10 years it doubles yeah we have seen
[02:19:01.860 --> 02:19:04.780]  them not not integrate not assimilate and that's not every Muslim because
[02:19:04.780 --> 02:19:08.460]  there's some great Muslims in this country but what we don't see integration
[02:19:08.460 --> 02:19:12.020]  don't see assimilation we've had 360 terrorist arrests this year the
[02:19:12.020 --> 02:19:17.140]  terrorism arrest rate goes up 60% each year 37% of British Muslims said they
[02:19:17.140 --> 02:19:21.260]  wish for a Shariah law what we've seen about Donald Trump getting criticised
[02:19:21.260 --> 02:19:25.140]  for in this country no one's talking about the reason why he said it no one's
[02:19:25.140 --> 02:19:28.060]  talking about the fact that 20% of American Muslims believe they can kill
[02:19:28.060 --> 02:19:32.020]  24 Shariah law and I was perhaps talking about 51% of American Muslims what
[02:19:32.020 --> 02:19:36.060]  Shariah law what is the alternative to stop in Muslim immigration the alternative
[02:19:36.060 --> 02:19:38.680]  for America not stopping the Muslim immigration is you are gonna end up like
[02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:41.940]  Europe you're gonna end up with terrorism on a weekly basis across Europe
[02:19:41.940 --> 02:19:45.020]  you're gonna end up with Muslim ghettos you're gonna end up with grooming gangs
[02:19:45.020 --> 02:19:49.380]  rape gangs rape jihad you're gonna end up in the same predicament stay there
[02:19:49.380 --> 02:19:54.700]  stay there sir Tommy Robinson and what sad is they don't want to integrate
[02:19:54.700 --> 02:19:57.900]  and they're so upset and angry with chips on their shoulders we're just

[02:25:05.460 --> 02:25:09.860]  and there is an aggression not by the first third fourth wave muslims that i
[02:25:09.860 --> 02:25:12.740]  knew in college and high school are really nice folks who are professionals
[02:25:12.740 --> 02:25:14.500]  that really wanted to come here and get away
[02:25:14.500 --> 02:25:18.500]  from the suppression of these countries no they want to bring it here and
[02:25:18.500 --> 02:25:21.860]  force it on you and all these imams we've played the clips are like

[02:25:52.340 --> 02:25:55.780]  though like this mayor of london that we have a clip of that you mentioned
[02:25:55.780 --> 02:25:59.380]  and paul mentioned saying there are no no go ghettos there are no areas where
[02:25:59.380 --> 02:26:03.140]  this has happened there are no when he knows full well what's going on
[02:26:03.140 --> 02:26:05.860]  what's wrong with them and can you speak to the weird
[02:26:05.860 --> 02:26:10.660]  merger of the left with this because they they hate the average western male
[02:26:10.660 --> 02:26:14.900]  even wearing pants they want to destroy it but they love
[02:26:14.900 --> 02:26:21.220]  headdresses mutilation enslavement i mean is it a death wish i don't know if
[02:26:21.220 --> 02:26:23.060]  they do love it i think they're using it
[02:26:23.060 --> 02:26:26.500]  um you have to remember many of these hardcore left groups are
[02:26:26.500 --> 02:26:30.020]  communist marxists they they hate the rule of law they hate democracy
[02:26:30.020 --> 02:26:33.220]  um that's not of anything to overthrow that that's right probably the biggest
[02:26:33.220 --> 02:26:35.860]  the biggest option they have there is islam so because really they hate
[02:26:35.860 --> 02:26:39.380]  religion too so the biggest option they have is islam
[02:26:39.380 --> 02:26:42.260]  um when we talk about what why is it happening and how is it being facilitated
[02:26:42.260 --> 02:26:45.460]  and happening why are our government and why are politicians of liquid
[02:26:45.460 --> 02:26:50.020]  being weak sardar abur i believe over 40 50 percent of our stock market they
[02:26:50.020 --> 02:26:53.380]  own every every port in this country they own majority shares in
[02:26:53.380 --> 02:26:56.740]  many of the banks um many of the supermarkets many of the shopping
[02:26:56.740 --> 02:27:00.100]  centers um they've bought their way simple they've bought their way for our
[02:27:00.100 --> 02:27:02.900]  country they've um our politicians our political leaders our
[02:27:02.900 --> 02:27:04.980]  governments have sold their soul to the devil
[02:27:04.980 --> 02:27:08.420]  um and we're left to pick up the pieces living on the streets
[02:27:08.420 --> 02:27:12.020]  and that that's the reality of it let's face it boris johnson doesn't live
[02:27:12.020 --> 02:27:15.700]  where we live his children don't go to school as a minority in the towns that
[02:27:15.700 --> 02:27:19.140]  our children will um what's what's okay for him
[02:27:19.140 --> 02:27:22.340]  it's tell me we have to live with it that's the reality of it so obviously
[02:27:22.340 --> 02:27:24.260]  you can sit there and say how nice and cozy is
[02:27:24.260 --> 02:27:27.700]  he's not the one on the end of genuine hostility just simply for being a white
[02:27:27.700 --> 02:27:30.580]  englishman or not muslim that's the reality of it
[02:27:30.580 --> 02:27:35.540]  um in my hometown um i can just i just speak again i don't speak about what
[02:27:35.540 --> 02:27:38.500]  i've read what i've studied which so many of these
[02:27:38.500 --> 02:27:41.780]  people on the left do we've gone to university we've got a degree and we've
[02:27:41.780 --> 02:27:44.660]  read this well you haven't lived in mate i mean you
[02:27:44.660 --> 02:27:48.260]  can't read a book on building a house and then build it i said you have no
[02:27:48.260 --> 02:27:51.540]  experience at all in what we're talking about you find in
[02:27:51.540 --> 02:27:54.660]  complete working class communities like where we're from
[02:27:54.660 --> 02:27:58.180]  there's no left there's no left-wing group like this
[02:27:58.180 --> 02:28:01.620]  we're all just we all understand the problem all of these people are
[02:28:01.620 --> 02:28:05.220]  living off their dad's money many of the times their mum and dad's money
[02:28:05.220 --> 02:28:09.540]  and um in trust funds and they're they're siding and it's like
[02:28:09.540 --> 02:28:12.580]  Winston Churchill said the the fascists of the future will come under the banner
[02:28:12.580 --> 02:28:15.860]  of anti-fascists and he was so right he was so right in many things he said
[02:28:15.860 --> 02:28:19.860]  he also said many great statements about islam and about muslims and all of them
[02:28:19.860 --> 02:28:23.300]  have come into fruition we should go over some of those
[02:28:23.300 --> 02:28:26.660]  quotes a little bit later uh continuing with the game plan
[02:28:26.660 --> 02:28:30.980]  it seems people are waking up big time now how will the controlled left and the
[02:28:30.980 --> 02:28:35.540]  islamic funded saudi arabian invasion respond to that
[02:28:35.540 --> 02:28:38.420]  um what's happening i've been standing for six years but there's a swing from
[02:28:38.420 --> 02:28:41.380]  left to right it's happening it's underway there's no left-wing group
[02:28:41.380 --> 02:28:43.700]  there's no political leaders there's no police there's no one that's going to
[02:28:43.700 --> 02:28:46.980]  stop it it's happening and we tried with the english
[02:28:46.980 --> 02:28:51.380]  defense league we were the first people to take to the streets in our thousands
[02:28:51.380 --> 02:28:54.980]  um and then i went we went into europe we tried to plant into europe and we were
[02:28:54.980 --> 02:28:58.900]  unsuccessful europe wasn't ready i've recently just come back from
[02:28:58.900 --> 02:29:02.580]  germany 40 000 people i went to the rally in the
[02:29:02.580 --> 02:29:06.180]  check republic where the president turned up and spoke at the the rally
[02:29:06.180 --> 02:29:10.500]  and he gave a clear statement about the west the mainstream media in the west
[02:29:10.500 --> 02:29:13.540]  he gave a clear statement about about the influence of saudi he gave a clear
[02:29:13.540 --> 02:29:16.020]  statement that he's not against foreigners because there's half a
[02:29:16.020 --> 02:29:19.780]  million foreigners in his country but he is against an ideology in a
[02:29:19.780 --> 02:29:22.900]  culture that we wouldn't not respect his country so
[02:29:22.900 --> 02:29:26.420]  things are moving fast um on the 6th of february

[02:33:36.660 --> 02:33:39.220]  how the democrats control the republican party
[02:33:39.220 --> 02:33:42.580]  by infiltrating the delegate level working with neocons
[02:33:42.580 --> 02:33:46.980]  and are admittedly planning to sabotage a
[02:33:46.980 --> 02:33:50.660]  candidate like donald trump in the electoral process down at the state
[02:33:50.660 --> 02:33:54.180]  level of the delegates so that special report will be airing it's about 10
[02:33:54.180 --> 02:33:59.220]  minutes long when paul watson hosts the next hour uh at the bottom of the hour
[02:33:59.220 --> 02:34:04.340]  maybe even earlier uh bill cosby just the last hour
[02:34:04.340 --> 02:34:10.660]  has sued accusers he said you assassinated my character
[02:34:10.660 --> 02:34:15.060]  now i'm not defending bill cosby but bill clinton settled at least three
[02:34:15.060 --> 02:34:18.260]  things out of court for women that claimed he raped them
[02:34:18.260 --> 02:34:22.660]  and i mean brutally and these were in cases where it'd be a cloak room at a
[02:34:22.660 --> 02:34:26.740]  party or at a government facility he'd say please speak to me for a moment
[02:34:26.740 --> 02:34:30.260]  he'd take him into a room next to a party grab around the throat bite their
[02:34:30.260 --> 02:34:33.940]  lip to hold them i mean we're talking sometimes
[02:34:33.940 --> 02:34:38.740]  bleeding is what they alleged and he settled that
[02:34:38.740 --> 02:34:42.340]  cosby hasn't and i would see these women and they'd be like yes i worked at the
[02:34:42.340 --> 02:34:45.860]  playboy facility and uh you know i went to parties with him
[02:34:45.860 --> 02:34:50.180]  you know 20 something times and you know i think he would drug me when we had
[02:34:50.180 --> 02:34:55.140]  sex i don't remember it i mean you go up to a hotel room you think he
[02:34:55.140 --> 02:35:00.260]  drugged you this is in the 60s and 70s
[02:35:00.740 --> 02:35:04.740]  you go to a hotel room it's like colby brian people
[02:35:04.740 --> 02:35:08.340]  turned out he didn't do all that or i mean it's not smart if you're a celebrity
[02:35:08.340 --> 02:35:12.100]  period or whatever just go up some random women to a hotel room but
[02:35:12.100 --> 02:35:17.460]  then they go out with him repeatedly in many of these cases these are women
[02:35:17.460 --> 02:35:21.620]  in my view that may have been abused at some level they may have been taken
[02:35:21.620 --> 02:35:26.420]  advantage of but can you say it's rape under this new feminist
[02:35:26.420 --> 02:35:29.380]  definition where oh i didn't want to have sex
[02:35:29.380 --> 02:35:35.060]  for you today i mean i did yesterday but i was drinking so it's rape
[02:35:35.060 --> 02:35:37.860]  and the police will tell you and it's come out in criminology now that
[02:35:37.860 --> 02:35:42.740]  upwards of half or more of rape claims get reversed later and are fake
[02:35:42.740 --> 02:35:45.860]  once it gets down to brass tax they go okay i was mad at him i just said it
[02:35:45.860 --> 02:35:49.380]  and women need to know this isn't just something you throw out there
[02:35:49.380 --> 02:35:52.820]  like you you rape me
[02:35:53.620 --> 02:35:56.980]  it's it's despicable there is real rape going on it is a problem
[02:35:56.980 --> 02:36:01.140]  and let me tell you where statistically it's culturally accepted
[02:36:01.140 --> 02:36:06.020]  and it's a fact it is culturally accepted in the middle east to a great
[02:36:06.020 --> 02:36:09.380]  extent that if a woman isn't accompanied by other men
[02:36:09.380 --> 02:36:12.980]  and their face isn't covered they are fair game to be raped
[02:36:12.980 --> 02:36:17.060]  period and you bring millions of people to germany alone
[02:36:17.060 --> 02:36:20.740]  who have that culture there's a lot of muslim cultures aren't that extreme
[02:36:20.740 --> 02:36:24.580]  and man they see some hot women walking along at midnight out of a bar
[02:36:24.580 --> 02:36:28.660]  in short skirts they're they're telling germans nationwide do not wear short
[02:36:28.660 --> 02:36:31.540]  skirts you know do not have christmas carols it may upset the muslims and
[02:36:31.540 --> 02:36:34.820]  the muslims are saying take it down so a political correctness with these
[02:36:34.820 --> 02:36:38.260]  invading groups they have been turbo charged with their
[02:36:38.260 --> 02:36:42.500]  arrogance and going back to the founder of the english defense league
[02:36:42.500 --> 02:36:45.700]  tommy robinson and watson recommend that we get on
[02:36:45.700 --> 02:36:49.460]  this is a guy whether you love maria hating who's been arrested

[02:36:58.260 --> 02:37:02.100]  and that was in july of this year i mean this is not a joke so i want him to
[02:37:02.100 --> 02:37:04.500]  talk about those stories what he's been through
[02:37:04.500 --> 02:37:07.620]  some of the things uh that have been happening to him when we go back to him
[02:37:07.620 --> 02:37:10.820]  in just one moment paul watson pop in

[02:37:32.420 --> 02:37:35.780]  now we call it christmas because that's what it is and for me it is about our

[02:40:15.460 --> 02:40:18.740]  floor now to talk about what you've been through what you've witnessed the true
[02:40:18.740 --> 02:40:22.660]  tyranny not just of the radical jihad but the left and others the
[02:40:22.660 --> 02:40:26.100]  status the globalist went to balkanized society what you've gone
[02:40:26.100 --> 02:40:30.020]  through where you see this is going and is the arrogance of the left and the
[02:40:30.020 --> 02:40:32.340]  arrogance of the jihadist but will finally be
[02:40:32.340 --> 02:40:36.180]  their undoing when they're imams from london to dc say your
[02:40:36.180 --> 02:40:40.180]  women are ours you are weak we will conquer you
[02:40:40.180 --> 02:40:44.020]  um i think the biggest the biggest shock to me that when i started this due to
[02:40:44.020 --> 02:40:47.460]  my experience in 2004 when they started in 2009
[02:40:47.460 --> 02:40:51.140]  i knew full well i'd face death threats i knew i'd get violently attacked
[02:40:51.140 --> 02:40:54.740]  i knew muslims would want to kill me i knew full well that um what i was not
[02:40:54.740 --> 02:41:01.220]  prepared for at all was the state the the state shut down the pressure
[02:41:01.220 --> 02:41:05.140]  the harassment the persecution when it didn't work on me they turned to my
[02:41:05.140 --> 02:41:08.020]  family i'll just briefly explain we'd started these
[02:41:08.020 --> 02:41:11.700]  protests in 2009 and obviously we were talking about sexual
[02:41:11.700 --> 02:41:14.900]  grooming the rape of our young girls now there was one police force in
[02:41:14.900 --> 02:41:17.380]  particular there's there's been a deep held report in
[02:41:17.380 --> 02:41:20.340]  roverham which is south yorkshire police force now
[02:41:20.340 --> 02:41:23.540]  they've been suppressing this for 20 years now i've gone to
[02:41:23.540 --> 02:41:26.340]  lutan airport i'm arrested at lutan airport i was due to fly to scotland
[02:41:26.340 --> 02:41:29.060]  to meet up with the scottish defense league this is all just in the first
[02:41:29.060 --> 02:41:32.420]  six nine months of starting the organization i've gone to lutan airport
[02:41:32.420 --> 02:41:35.220]  i've been arrested by special branch they've took me to the police station
[02:41:35.220 --> 02:41:38.900]  they've done simultaneous raids they've raided my mum's house where my mum and
[02:41:38.900 --> 02:41:41.620]  dad live and they've raided my house from my wife and children in when they've
[02:41:41.620 --> 02:41:44.980]  gone to my house i've sent arm police they've shut the whole road off
[02:41:44.980 --> 02:41:47.700]  they've spent six to eight hours in each house they took my mum and dad's
[02:41:47.700 --> 02:41:50.980]  computers they took all the phones all the electrical devices
[02:41:50.980 --> 02:41:54.740]  when i got into interview they said i was arrested and it was south yorkshire
[02:41:54.740 --> 02:41:57.220]  police i was due to be talking at a demonstration
[02:41:57.220 --> 02:41:59.860]  there and obviously i was going to be highlighting their failures in sexual
[02:41:59.860 --> 02:42:04.340]  grooming um so their tactic was to come down kick my doors off prior to the
[02:42:04.340 --> 02:42:08.260]  demonstration um imposed bail conditions i was arrested on a criminal
[02:42:08.260 --> 02:42:12.260]  damage what they actually said in interview was that on a hotel room door
[02:42:12.260 --> 02:42:15.780]  you've got the connecting bit which it was which was broken and i was staying
[02:42:15.780 --> 02:42:18.580]  in the hotel now that cost 30 pounds they had at
[02:42:18.580 --> 02:42:22.020]  least 20 police officers who who ransacked both our houses
[02:42:22.020 --> 02:42:25.380]  i was then given bail conditions for this criminal damage not to associate or
[02:42:25.380 --> 02:42:28.180]  contact with three or more english defense police supporters
[02:42:28.180 --> 02:42:30.900]  the bail date i was given was to coincide with the date of our
[02:42:30.900 --> 02:42:34.660]  demonstration um after three weeks all charges were
[02:42:34.660 --> 02:42:37.300]  dropped i put in a complaint through the IPCC
[02:42:37.300 --> 02:42:40.100]  which is the independent police complaints commission
[02:42:40.100 --> 02:42:43.380]  um and it turns out that they actually had a statement from the manager of the
[02:42:43.380 --> 02:42:45.940]  hotel who said i had nothing to do with the
[02:42:45.940 --> 02:42:49.300]  criminal damage so they had completely fabricated
[02:42:49.300 --> 02:42:52.660]  this to get warrants to come and basically intimidate
[02:42:52.660 --> 02:42:55.780]  intimidate me into silence and persecute my family
[02:42:55.780 --> 02:42:58.580]  now and three that they dropped all charges now
[02:42:58.580 --> 02:43:01.220]  three months after this and i've got that in black and white i've got that in
[02:43:01.220 --> 02:43:03.620]  black and white now we know this is politically directed we know it's
[02:43:03.620 --> 02:43:06.260]  this is all been all of the uk news everything you're saying if your new
[02:43:06.260 --> 02:43:09.780]  listeners on record but did any of the police at the
[02:43:09.780 --> 02:43:13.860]  low level ever quietly apologize to you because i know that this is from higher
[02:43:13.860 --> 02:43:16.900]  ed so many times do you know what do you know
[02:43:16.900 --> 02:43:20.100]  when they come in my house like after that they come back three months later
[02:43:20.100 --> 02:43:23.460]  now they're not going to affect the online wife
[02:43:23.460 --> 02:43:26.820]  who's living in our house and the neighbors and everything like that
[02:43:26.820 --> 02:43:30.580]  the pressure it brought it it was a plan what they were doing and that that was
[02:43:30.580 --> 02:43:34.420]  to intimidate me when that failed they come back three months later
[02:43:34.420 --> 02:43:37.460]  and they come through the door again they arrested me and they arrested my wife
[02:43:37.460 --> 02:43:40.340]  was six months pregnant and as they arrested my wife it was a
[02:43:40.340 --> 02:43:44.340]  loot and police officer and he just said he said i'm so sorry yeah i said
[02:43:44.340 --> 02:43:47.380]  what he goes we're taking your wife i said what do you mean you're taking my
[02:43:47.380 --> 02:43:49.780]  wife she's six months pregnant what you're taking my wife for
[02:43:49.780 --> 02:43:53.540]  and they arrested her on tax evasion they held her on bail for
[02:43:53.540 --> 02:43:57.620]  over three years having to repeatedly go back and in the end three years later
[02:43:57.620 --> 02:44:01.220]  they used her security and stability and safety of her and my family
[02:44:01.220 --> 02:44:05.940]  um to blackmail me to blackmail me into um pleading guilty to an offense
[02:44:05.940 --> 02:44:10.260]  and some people i don't really think as i said it won't do it justice explain it
[02:44:10.260 --> 02:44:12.820]  now but i can go through some of the situations you don't know until they've
[02:44:12.820 --> 02:44:15.700]  got your pregnant wife in jail and say sign this we're not letting her out
[02:44:15.700 --> 02:44:18.660]  you don't know the pressure that puts pure evil
[02:44:18.660 --> 02:44:23.540]  well and i i just i still can't believe that they've done it so blatantly
[02:44:23.540 --> 02:44:26.980]  i can't believe that as what you spoke about earlier i was on the charity walk
[02:44:26.980 --> 02:44:30.180]  and i was doing a charity walk and um the muslim leaders have said that
[02:44:30.180 --> 02:44:32.820]  basically we weren't allowed to enter into the borough of tower hamlets which
[02:44:32.820 --> 02:44:36.100]  is a huge the biggest borough of london we weren't allowed to walk through there
[02:44:36.100 --> 02:44:40.100]  on our charity walk um the police arrested us and what they did
[02:44:40.100 --> 02:44:43.060]  is if anyone can watch this put in tommy robinson charity walk
[02:44:43.060 --> 02:44:47.140]  yeah on youtube you'll see which is definitely two undercover police officers
[02:44:47.140 --> 02:44:52.180]  they come in and they attack us and then the police let them walk off
[02:44:52.180 --> 02:44:54.900]  here's the police the police from my house one second i'm just walking out

[02:46:42.900 --> 02:46:46.340]  ask some questions as well but continuing with all the persecution
[02:46:46.340 --> 02:46:50.340]  you were getting into how they allowed folks to attack you on the charity walk
[02:46:50.340 --> 02:46:53.220]  and we'll show some of that on screen right now
[02:46:53.220 --> 02:46:56.020]  yeah if you if you actually show so basically we're doing a charity walk for
[02:46:56.020 --> 02:46:59.140]  a young goodbye and girl um now tower hamlets is one of the
[02:46:59.140 --> 02:47:02.900]  boroughs which is a logo zone yeah so the the muslim leaders have come out and
[02:47:02.900 --> 02:47:05.460]  said that we're not allowed to enter that borough and we're on a charity walk we're
[02:47:05.460 --> 02:47:08.420]  going across london which takes us through tower hamlets
[02:47:08.420 --> 02:47:11.060]  the police come see me the night before and said you're not allowed to walk it
[02:47:11.060 --> 02:47:13.460]  or we don't want you to walk into tower hamlets
[02:47:13.460 --> 02:47:16.660]  and i said they wanted me to take a 16 mile detour
[02:47:16.660 --> 02:47:20.500]  oh so i've only got little legs so i was like look it's my capital city and i
[02:47:20.500 --> 02:47:22.500]  said why can't i walk through tower hamlets and they said well because there's
[02:47:22.500 --> 02:47:25.620]  mosques i said i live in lute and there's 30 mosques what are you talking
[02:47:25.620 --> 02:47:28.500]  about so like there's mosques all over this country
[02:47:28.500 --> 02:47:32.980]  every everywhere over two and a half thousand mosques um so
[02:47:32.980 --> 02:47:35.380]  when we've turned up to do the charity walk as we're walking through they've
[02:47:35.380 --> 02:47:39.060]  allowed two people to come into us and turn around and physically assault us
[02:47:39.060 --> 02:47:41.700]  now once we've been physically assaulted we don't react we put our hands up
[02:47:41.700 --> 02:47:45.220]  because we know what's happening anyway we put our hands up and they allow these
[02:47:45.220 --> 02:47:49.540]  police officers who who attacked us to walk off and they walk off and then we're
[02:47:49.540 --> 02:47:52.500]  arrest and the the police officer arrests me and i said what you're
[02:47:52.500 --> 02:47:55.060]  arresting me for haven't done anything we've just been assaulted
[02:47:55.060 --> 02:47:59.220]  um she arrest us for um preventing a police officer in a line of duty
[02:47:59.220 --> 02:48:03.140]  they didn't just arrest us what they did then was i was given bail conditions i
[02:48:03.140 --> 02:48:06.260]  was charged i was given bail conditions not to enter the borough of tower
[02:48:06.260 --> 02:48:10.420]  hamlets which was enforcing exactly what the imama told them to enforce
[02:48:10.420 --> 02:48:14.660]  um and this just hasn't this has gone on and on and on there's so many
[02:48:14.660 --> 02:48:18.020]  circumstances they put full charges on you on video
[02:48:18.020 --> 02:48:22.340]  under the orders of the imam false charges false charges which were
[02:48:22.340 --> 02:48:25.860]  subsequently four months later once i went through court three times they were
[02:48:25.860 --> 02:48:29.300]  kicked now but that's not just um they've done so
[02:48:29.300 --> 02:48:33.140]  like i thought everything they've done in the persecution was when i finally
[02:48:33.140 --> 02:48:36.660]  left the english defense league in 2013 i thought i've given them what they
[02:48:36.660 --> 02:48:39.460]  wanted um they'd they'd persecute my family
[02:48:39.460 --> 02:48:42.180]  they'd gone i looked in their investigation then they'd gone and
[02:48:42.180 --> 02:48:45.140]  withdrawn warrants on my mum and dad's bank accounts
[02:48:45.140 --> 02:48:48.020]  um they'd arrested my brother-in-law my cousin they'd gone
[02:48:48.020 --> 02:48:52.500]  raided my nans they'd gone basically through every member of my family they'd
[02:48:52.500 --> 02:48:56.100]  gone through every tax which is the irs in america
[02:48:56.100 --> 02:48:59.380]  they'd gone through every single thing whether in total harassment and then
[02:48:59.380 --> 02:49:01.780]  still you're not allowed to even go out in public
[02:49:01.780 --> 02:49:04.980]  they arrested you this year they arrest me this year so
[02:49:04.980 --> 02:49:08.340]  i am i subsequently after four years of being on conditions i went
[02:49:08.340 --> 02:49:12.980]  i went on trial for what they said was tax evasion they said i owed them 130
[02:49:12.980 --> 02:49:17.140]  sorry sorry yes we got your video back go ahead
[02:49:17.140 --> 02:49:20.820]  yeah they said i owed them 137 thousand pounds in tax they'd completely
[02:49:20.820 --> 02:49:23.700]  fabricated come and they held me on this charge for four years
[02:49:23.700 --> 02:49:27.300]  they froze my assets my businesses but when the English defense league started
[02:49:27.300 --> 02:49:29.540]  i had a successful plumbing business in point six men
[02:49:29.540 --> 02:49:32.500]  i had a sunbed solarium shop in the town center
[02:49:32.500 --> 02:49:36.260]  um i was fine i had seven properties i was working hard
[02:49:36.260 --> 02:49:39.300]  they closed it all down they held me under conditions which i believe the
[02:49:39.300 --> 02:49:41.460]  labor government bought in probably for terrorists
[02:49:41.460 --> 02:49:45.700]  um they froze all my assets with no crime and they held me for three years
[02:49:45.700 --> 02:49:49.380]  and and subsequently i got knocked down and now we know that obama ordered them
[02:49:49.380 --> 02:49:53.380]  this week or last week to cover up that these people were muslim or have been
[02:49:53.380 --> 02:49:57.380]  trained in jihad camps and that they let her in with a fake visa
[02:49:57.380 --> 02:50:01.140]  information they ordered the FBI to say it wasn't terrorism
[02:50:01.140 --> 02:50:05.140]  there they've banned hundreds of people entering uh the uk from the us
[02:50:05.140 --> 02:50:09.460]  who mildly criticize islam there is absolute submission
[02:50:09.460 --> 02:50:12.420]  and worship i'm gonna skip this network break it's so important
[02:50:12.420 --> 02:50:16.740]  absolute worship by the uk government and by the obama government of radical
[02:50:16.740 --> 02:50:19.860]  muslims why do they worship them so much why are they
[02:50:19.860 --> 02:50:24.020]  above the law it's the um the influence they have
[02:50:24.020 --> 02:50:27.540]  you know like say for example in my again i'll bring you back to my hometown
[02:50:27.540 --> 02:50:32.020]  my hometown has 40 to 50 000 muslims the labor party get 40 000 votes
[02:50:32.020 --> 02:50:36.020]  that keeps them in power they do a deal with the central and that's only that's
[02:50:36.020 --> 02:50:38.820]  only when they're four percent they're that powerful as a block vote spoke
[02:50:38.820 --> 02:50:42.900]  and politics they're that powerful that they do a deal with a local council of
[02:50:42.900 --> 02:50:45.860]  mosques who are all coordinated together through one leader
[02:50:45.860 --> 02:50:49.780]  um they've got the labor vote and and quite frankly we're we're irrelevant
[02:50:49.780 --> 02:50:53.380]  we're irrelevant in the scheme of things in the world so that's just people in
[02:50:53.380 --> 02:50:56.660]  old liberal republics are just out having fun working
[02:50:56.660 --> 02:51:00.100]  hard don't really organize watching football games
[02:51:00.100 --> 02:51:03.940]  and folks from third world dictatorships they organize they're under control of
[02:51:03.940 --> 02:51:06.340]  just a few leaders they all donate large parts of
[02:51:06.340 --> 02:51:10.340]  their what they make to them money and it's on it's a takeover
[02:51:10.340 --> 02:51:13.220]  it's a takeover and no one can say it's nothing different
[02:51:13.220 --> 02:51:16.180]  and what the worrying thing is look four percent of the country's muslim we
[02:51:16.180 --> 02:51:18.660]  really need to be thinking about what's going to be like when it's 20 percent
[02:51:18.660 --> 02:51:22.180]  and and the biggest fear what i had even when i went into prison they
[02:51:22.180 --> 02:51:25.780]  they finally got me into a prison on on a on a mortgage forward case which was
[02:51:25.780 --> 02:51:28.660]  not my mortgage again i had to plead guilty to someone else's case
[02:51:28.660 --> 02:51:32.500]  i had to if unless i believe me i know you can put one number wrong
[02:51:32.500 --> 02:51:35.140]  on a mortgage deal like throw you in prison for it you can bounce a check
[02:51:35.140 --> 02:51:38.020]  they throw you in prison for it we understand we followed your case
[02:51:38.020 --> 02:51:40.900]  and we see the videos you've done nothing they arrest you this year you went
[02:51:40.900 --> 02:51:43.620]  to a draw a mohammed contest and got arrested
[02:51:43.620 --> 02:51:46.980]  no so i was due to be talking at i had a meeting arranged at the house of
[02:51:46.980 --> 02:51:50.500]  lords yeah and it was for the 23rd of july now
[02:51:50.500 --> 02:51:54.980]  seven days before that the police came with no justification no reason
[02:51:54.980 --> 02:51:59.460]  they took me straight into peter per prison um peter per prison is a prison
[02:51:59.460 --> 02:52:03.380]  where some it's every prison in this country they're like heist is training
[02:52:03.380 --> 02:52:06.500]  camps they're full of radical muslims i explained to them straight away what was
[02:52:06.500 --> 02:52:08.260]  going to happen to me so i'm going to get killed
[02:52:08.260 --> 02:52:11.620]  i've got these are all new teeth i've had blood clotsome i've had a blood clot
[02:52:11.620 --> 02:52:14.820]  removes on my head when i was in prison the last time they actually locked me
[02:52:14.820 --> 02:52:18.180]  in a room with them i was locked in a room and left to get killed
[02:52:18.180 --> 02:52:21.540]  i said i was lucky to come out of it and that's happened time and time again i'm
[02:52:21.540 --> 02:52:24.980]  on the no one described what i did to you i mean did you give as good as you got
[02:52:24.980 --> 02:52:29.700]  yeah i did yeah of course you have to and and and even this last time well
[02:52:29.700 --> 02:52:31.860]  when i got called in for that last eight days
[02:52:31.860 --> 02:52:35.140]  i then got a rest further arrested so when i've gone in i've said to them i'm
[02:52:35.140 --> 02:52:37.940]  going to get killed in here you know i'm going to get killed i've walked out on
[02:52:37.940 --> 02:52:41.060]  this on the wing the first day and i've had a lad come up to me he's put his
[02:52:41.060 --> 02:52:44.020]  hand over over his face he goes you you're going to get done with boiling
[02:52:44.020 --> 02:52:46.820]  water and sugar now that's where they put boiling water they put sugar in their
[02:52:46.820 --> 02:52:49.300]  throat in your face it'll take your whole face off
[02:52:49.300 --> 02:52:51.700]  so i've looked well they like to do that to women that's another thing the
[02:52:51.700 --> 02:52:54.900]  feminists seem to get off on them they love that part
[02:52:54.900 --> 02:52:57.700]  i've looked across i've seen that i said who's going to do it they've pointed
[02:52:57.700 --> 02:53:00.980]  out that the lad said the Somalian the lad behind the doors
[02:53:00.980 --> 02:53:04.020]  paying him but remember i've been for eight days these Muslim lads have been
[02:53:04.020 --> 02:53:08.260]  for 26 years for just killing two people they have nothing to lose and they will
[02:53:08.260 --> 02:53:10.660]  kill me so i've done the only thing i could do
[02:53:10.660 --> 02:53:14.180]  which was pre-empty preemptive strike and then i've been put down
[02:53:14.180 --> 02:53:17.940]  segregation but my license conditions finished on the 18th
[02:53:17.940 --> 02:53:20.820]  on the 22nd of july so under no circumstances
[02:53:20.820 --> 02:53:24.260]  i should have walked out of that prison on the 22nd of july i had an event planned
[02:53:24.260 --> 02:53:27.220]  on the 23rd of july 22nd of july come i'm still in
[02:53:27.220 --> 02:53:30.020]  prison 23rd of july come i'm still in prison
[02:53:30.020 --> 02:53:32.900]  they released me on the 24th of july once i know the date had gone
[02:53:32.900 --> 02:53:36.500]  they purposely held me illegally and this and the things that have gone on i
[02:53:36.500 --> 02:53:40.180]  gotta say your police are particularly cowardly and evil
[02:53:40.180 --> 02:53:43.700]  that we have a lot of bad feds here in this country but most local departments
[02:53:43.700 --> 02:53:46.340]  will not engage in such evil against innocent people
[02:53:46.340 --> 02:53:48.980]  and i saw them beating you up and arresting you for no reason in london
[02:53:48.980 --> 02:53:51.620]  they look like they were enjoying it i didn't know they could pile crap that
[02:53:51.620 --> 02:53:54.900]  high yeah again i'll do have to say that every
[02:53:54.900 --> 02:53:57.620]  individual officer i've met even when they've arrested me
[02:53:57.620 --> 02:54:01.060]  are apologetic and seem very sympathetic to what we're saying
[02:54:01.060 --> 02:54:04.660]  um what about the ones that assaulted you um
[02:54:04.660 --> 02:54:08.180]  yeah that day again they're under orders i know they're under orders
[02:54:08.180 --> 02:54:12.020]  somebody tells me to assault peaceful people i'm not doing it if i was a cop
[02:54:12.020 --> 02:54:16.100]  i know yeah i'm not either but that's because i'm not coward
[02:54:16.100 --> 02:54:19.380]  but at the same time i wonder how many times like even for example the
[02:54:19.380 --> 02:54:22.420]  prosecutor the prosecutor who prosecuted me in a completely
[02:54:22.420 --> 02:54:25.700]  fraudulent completely trumped up case that was his last prosecution he got
[02:54:25.700 --> 02:54:29.380]  made up to a judge straight after that case so there's handshakes conspiracies
[02:54:29.380 --> 02:54:33.140]  no i don't know how it works yeah i was approached when i was in prison i was
[02:54:33.140 --> 02:54:36.820]  approached and asked when i've got out of prison if i'd if i'd read if i'd
[02:54:36.820 --> 02:54:41.460]  unite the right so for them for them for a secretive
[02:54:41.460 --> 02:54:44.980]  unit they wanted you to be an operative to go in and run the whole show to run
[02:54:44.980 --> 02:54:47.380]  the whole show uh it's a secretive unit called
[02:54:47.380 --> 02:54:50.580]  met intelligence bureau and when i and i said i've got no
[02:54:50.580 --> 02:54:53.700]  there's no way i'm doing it when i get out of here i told them my plans i'm
[02:54:53.700 --> 02:54:57.380]  going back to work you've had that they had my assets restrained for four years
[02:54:57.380 --> 02:55:00.500]  i said i'm selling my properties and i'm going back to work now when i got out
[02:55:00.500 --> 02:55:04.260]  when i got out of custody i'd been out six weeks i was driving
[02:55:04.260 --> 02:55:08.420]  and i got arrested i got arrested by three cars pulled in i was held for 24

[02:55:32.260 --> 02:55:36.260]  i said i'm not in a predicament he said yes you are he said because if if you
[02:55:36.260 --> 02:55:39.540]  get charged with this burglary you'll do eight months on license
[02:55:39.540 --> 02:55:42.580]  recall not just for you do eight months but the whole country is going to be
[02:55:42.580 --> 02:55:45.940]  told you're a burglar if you agree to sit down and have a chat
[02:55:45.940 --> 02:55:49.620]  with us we can make that go away and i'm sitting there i've just come out of
[02:55:49.620 --> 02:55:53.220]  custody i've left the english defense and i don't know where to turn
[02:55:53.220 --> 02:55:56.500]  and then i've i and because i told them my plans
[02:55:56.500 --> 02:55:59.620]  of selling my properties yeah you told them i'm out of this you told them i'm
[02:55:59.620 --> 02:56:02.980]  done and they're no no you're gonna work for us now you're gonna work for us
[02:56:02.980 --> 02:56:06.340]  and then because i refuse they put the burglary charge when that failed and i
[02:56:06.340 --> 02:56:09.060]  still said well i'm gonna have to do the eight months but
[02:56:09.060 --> 02:56:11.940]  facing eight months for me going in prison i'm lucky i've made it out that's
[02:56:11.940 --> 02:56:15.220]  the truth i'm i'm lucky to have made it but you're not gonna submit
[02:56:15.220 --> 02:56:18.020]  i'm not gonna submit and then what's happened is i've got a letter through the
[02:56:18.020 --> 02:56:21.460]  post saying that they're taking three hundred and fifteen thousand pounds of
[02:56:21.460 --> 02:56:24.340]  me all i have to do five years in custody
[02:56:24.340 --> 02:56:27.540]  yeah and again i get contacted by met intelligence
[02:56:27.540 --> 02:56:30.500]  bureau who say if you agree to work with us you don't have to pay the three
[02:56:30.500 --> 02:56:34.660]  hundred and fifteen thousand pounds i refuse it again i told them there's no
[02:56:34.660 --> 02:56:37.140]  chance i go to court to fight the three hundred and
[02:56:37.140 --> 02:56:40.660]  fifteen thousand pound the judge actually ruled and this is all as i said
[02:56:40.660 --> 02:56:43.620]  where this is all laid out in my book the judge actually ruled that i have to
[02:56:43.620 --> 02:56:48.260]  pay the police a hundred and twenty five thousand pounds with no justification
[02:56:48.260 --> 02:56:51.700]  now look when all this gets defeated you're going to be a hero
[02:56:51.700 --> 02:56:55.780]  and uh it's just amazing i have to tell my family house they took my family home
[02:56:55.780 --> 02:56:59.620]  good god i know you're going forever the persecution the good news is as you
[02:56:59.620 --> 02:57:02.340]  said you've been vindicated the government covering up the rape of
[02:57:02.340 --> 02:57:05.780]  all these little girls has been covered up the rape gangs they are in deep
[02:57:05.780 --> 02:57:09.220]  trouble now paul oughtson i want to bring you in here with a few few
[02:57:09.220 --> 02:57:11.700]  comments and we got five more minutes then you're going to be hosting the show
[02:57:11.700 --> 02:57:14.660]  and i'd like you to invite this fellow to continue if you'd like but paul oughtson
[02:57:14.660 --> 02:57:17.940]  go ahead yeah i mean all this just
[02:57:17.940 --> 02:57:21.780]  underscores the fact that this stealth g had whatever you want to call it
[02:57:21.780 --> 02:57:26.100]  cannot happen without the help of the state and i mean tommy explain why they
[02:57:26.100 --> 02:57:29.860]  bring in this group of immigrants who are dependent on government
[02:57:29.860 --> 02:57:33.220]  they're more likely to vote for big government parties so that's the
[02:57:33.220 --> 02:57:36.580]  incentive for the state to bring them in in the first place
[02:57:36.580 --> 02:57:40.100]  and while they're going after people like tommy they're also going after
[02:57:40.100 --> 02:57:42.980]  you know for example two years ago there was a couple
[02:57:42.980 --> 02:57:47.620]  i think it was a polish couple that had adopted a child and they supported
[02:57:47.620 --> 02:57:52.260]  ukip which is now a mainstream british political party that is anti mass
[02:57:52.260 --> 02:57:55.860]  immigration they had that child despite the fact they had an
[02:57:55.860 --> 02:57:59.780]  exemplary record just taken from them by the state
[02:57:59.780 --> 02:58:03.220]  simply for supporting this anti-immigration political party but
[02:58:03.220 --> 02:58:07.620]  they still failed ukips now the fastest growing in the uk and europe
[02:58:07.620 --> 02:58:11.620]  they can arrest the panel they want but it's just as mr robinson said the
[02:58:11.620 --> 02:58:15.220]  sleeping giants awakening yeah and then you've got you know you
[02:58:15.220 --> 02:58:17.380]  talked about winston church ill quotes earlier
[02:58:17.380 --> 02:58:20.740]  paul weston a politician was arrested on the street
[02:58:20.740 --> 02:58:24.660]  for reading out winston church ill quotes about islam but people like and
[02:58:24.660 --> 02:58:28.660]  gem chowdhury are free to call for stoning homosexuals to death

[03:00:48.420 --> 03:00:51.380]  countries to waive all their rights so they're just going to have the u.s and
[03:00:51.380 --> 03:00:55.060]  the uk and others selectively turn off our power that's really what the deal
[03:00:55.060 --> 03:01:00.500]  always is in india and china and everybody else doesn't have to
[03:01:00.500 --> 03:01:05.460]  simply amazing that's just some of the news up on drudge report dot com and

[03:01:16.180 --> 03:01:22.420]  and they openly announced this new goal instead of the extinction of the planet
[03:01:22.420 --> 03:01:25.860]  and then we continue with other articles aco leader resigned for threatening
[03:01:25.860 --> 03:01:29.620]  mass murder of trump supporters they're actually defending him when last
[03:01:29.620 --> 03:01:33.300]  week when he came out and said it but now he's been forced to step down
[03:01:33.300 --> 03:01:36.340]  we have video look what muslim refugees left behind on the autobahn it
[03:01:36.340 --> 03:01:41.620]  literally looks for dozens of miles like a landfill has been put there
[03:01:41.620 --> 03:01:45.140]  and there's the hatred they have screaming yelling trying to car jack screaming
[03:01:45.140 --> 03:01:48.500]  a lot bar we're gonna get you they've been taught to hate us then they're
[03:01:48.500 --> 03:01:53.700]  brought in and then attached to socialism's milk
[03:01:53.700 --> 03:01:58.500]  facility that's really our tax money tommy robinson where does all this in
[03:01:58.500 --> 03:02:02.900]  you say you think the worm is turning but i mean when you see the hatred of the
[03:02:02.900 --> 03:02:06.500]  so-called left uh you know the green party heads in germany
[03:02:06.500 --> 03:02:10.340]  saying we want germany to die white people are bad it's not i'm not even
[03:02:10.340 --> 03:02:12.260]  racist i'm not against other groups of people
[03:02:12.260 --> 03:02:15.620]  i don't see others people acting like the leftist white people and then these
[03:02:15.620 --> 03:02:19.620]  weirdo radical muslims i mean why do they want to destroy what's left of europe
[03:02:19.620 --> 03:02:23.380]  it's already collapsing i mean is it like a trophy they're gonna mount on
[03:02:23.380 --> 03:02:25.700]  their wall that they destroy what their ancestors built
[03:02:25.700 --> 03:02:29.700]  is it a mental illness who are these freaks they despise our history they
[03:02:29.700 --> 03:02:33.860]  despise everything about us um white guilt is what europe's suffering with
[03:02:33.860 --> 03:02:37.220]  and it has been for a long time especially um
[03:02:37.220 --> 03:02:40.980]  angela merkel and the german generation of today have nothing to feel guilty about
[03:02:40.980 --> 03:02:43.300]  they should be proud of the country they live in should be proud of the
[03:02:43.300 --> 03:02:47.380]  economy the culture they have um the the changing moment i think will be the
[03:02:47.380 --> 03:02:51.460]  first time we see a political leader elected whether it be marie le penne
[03:02:51.460 --> 03:02:55.300]  whether it be gut builders who will try to enforce law because when they try to
[03:02:55.300 --> 03:02:58.580]  enforce law by gods muslims will not allow them to
[03:02:58.580 --> 03:03:02.660]  and that will be the moment um as soon as they try to enforce any sort of laws
[03:03:02.660 --> 03:03:05.620]  because you just said it every time they try to enforce even arresting somebody
[03:03:05.620 --> 03:03:09.540]  for a raid they burn down half of paris that's that maybe it's intimidations
[03:03:09.540 --> 03:03:12.900]  while they're letting them do it maybe it's gone from go go ahead
[03:03:12.900 --> 03:03:17.300]  that yeah they are now it's um they know what's going to happen
[03:03:17.300 --> 03:03:20.420]  but that's for example this country in britain they try if they try to ban the
[03:03:20.420 --> 03:03:22.660]  burqa muslims will riot they will not be able to
[03:03:22.660 --> 03:03:26.740]  ban the burqa and that's just a small thing and that's with a population of
[03:03:26.740 --> 03:03:30.100]  only three to four million now that that population is growing and growing very
[03:03:30.100 --> 03:03:33.540]  fast and with this recent refugee crisis we've seen
[03:03:33.540 --> 03:03:36.660]  over a million into germany this year well when they're allowed to bring their
[03:03:36.660 --> 03:03:39.540]  families in the next 12 months that'll be four five million
[03:03:39.540 --> 03:03:44.100]  um europe's head in one way and it's exactly we're heading to conflict
[03:03:44.100 --> 03:03:47.540]  unfortunately but that conflict has to happen when we can still win
[03:03:47.540 --> 03:03:50.500]  and when we can still be triumphant and we still have freedom
[03:03:50.500 --> 03:03:54.260]  um and i think what will happen is they'll wake asleep and join and our
[03:03:54.260 --> 03:03:56.900]  love for freedom will always outweigh their love for sharia
[03:03:56.900 --> 03:04:00.580]  and people will come out and they will as he's growing now what you see now is
[03:04:00.580 --> 03:04:04.100]  just a star it's just a star and this refugee crisis that's just a trickle
[03:04:04.100 --> 03:04:07.780]  the whirlwind's coming why are the radical muslims are taking over islam
[03:04:07.780 --> 03:04:09.940]  right now by the way in their other countries they keep fighting with each
[03:04:09.940 --> 03:04:12.980]  other constantly why are they so arrogant i mean if i came from that
[03:04:12.980 --> 03:04:15.220]  type of suppression i'd want to be in the west
[03:04:15.220 --> 03:04:18.980]  um well when i spent 22 weeks on solitary confinement when i spent 22
[03:04:18.980 --> 03:04:21.060]  weeks on solitary confinement i dissected the garram
[03:04:21.060 --> 03:04:24.340]  what i did is i opened up the garram and i wrote reference everywhere it said you
[03:04:24.340 --> 03:04:27.140]  can't be friends with jews or christians i logged it down
[03:04:27.140 --> 03:04:30.660]  i also made references to when it says you can rape non-muslim women
[03:04:30.660 --> 03:04:34.740]  i made references to that and um and i ended up with 14 references for where
[03:04:34.740 --> 03:04:37.620]  they're allowed to they're allowed to take non-muslim women as sexual slaves
[03:04:37.620 --> 03:04:41.540]  i ended up with pages of references of where they can not where they're told
[03:04:41.540 --> 03:04:44.580]  not told not to be friends with jews or christians now when you're being brought
[03:04:44.580 --> 03:04:46.900]  up with that ideology when you're being brought up with that
[03:04:46.900 --> 03:04:50.340]  shoved down your throat and told constantly how bad that disbelievers are
[03:04:50.340 --> 03:04:53.380]  um that will turn that would turn to hostility exactly stay there one more
[03:04:53.380 --> 03:04:57.060]  segment tommy robinson paul watson takes over both from england
[03:04:57.060 --> 03:05:01.300]  straight ahead and a bunch of other news despite all the status rhetoric that
[03:05:01.300 --> 03:05:04.900]  gun control works here's five reasons why it won't number one california has
[03:05:04.900 --> 03:05:08.340]  many of the most restrictive gun laws in the country yet those laws did
[03:05:08.340 --> 03:05:11.700]  absolutely nothing to stop this hand burner dino shooting number two
[03:05:11.700 --> 03:05:14.820]  paris france also has some of the most restrictive gun laws in the world but
[03:05:14.820 --> 03:05:18.420]  those laws also did nothing to stop november 13th isis attacks
[03:05:18.420 --> 03:05:22.420]  number three it's estimated that someone in chicago is shot every 2.8
[03:05:22.420 --> 03:05:25.700]  hours despite the city's strict gun laws number four
[03:05:25.700 --> 03:05:28.900]  mexico also has restrictive gun laws just like chicago
[03:05:28.900 --> 03:05:32.580]  yet over 160 000 people have been murdered in the country's drug war since
[03:05:32.580 --> 03:05:35.540]  2007 the only people who are actually stopping the
[03:05:35.540 --> 03:05:38.180]  mexican cartels are private citizens who are openly
[03:05:38.180 --> 03:05:41.540]  defying mexico's gun laws to form self-defense militias
[03:05:41.540 --> 03:05:45.380]  number five president obama has been arming and funding isis link sarin
[03:05:45.380 --> 03:05:48.260]  rebels for quite some time in fact obama approved the
[03:05:48.260 --> 03:05:52.180]  re-arming of the so-called moderate rebels on october 1st the same day he
[03:05:52.180 --> 03:05:55.380]  called for gun control in response to the community college shooting up in

[03:08:19.700 --> 03:08:21.700]  there is a season
[03:08:21.700 --> 03:08:25.540]  we're back live with the 4th hour of the alex jones show i'm paul joes
[03:08:25.540 --> 03:08:30.260]  of course i'll be with you for the next hour we're talking to tommy robinson
[03:08:30.260 --> 03:08:35.540]  author of enemy of the state about islam about radical islam about the
[03:08:35.540 --> 03:08:40.420]  refugee crisis and again let's get this clear we're not just talking
[03:08:40.420 --> 03:08:44.420]  about the jihadist threat of course the threat posed by islam
[03:08:44.420 --> 03:08:49.620]  is not just coming from jihadists who will commit terror and violence to impose
[03:08:49.620 --> 03:08:53.780]  this on the west it's coming from islamists who will work
[03:08:53.780 --> 03:08:58.740]  through the political system who will lean on government to impose
[03:08:58.740 --> 03:09:02.660]  this belief system through sharia law which again is
[03:09:02.660 --> 03:09:07.140]  completely incompatible with the west as has been proven
[03:09:07.140 --> 03:09:10.420]  by the rotherum rape scandal by numerous other
[03:09:10.420 --> 03:09:14.260]  pedophile scandals in the united kingdom which were covered up
[03:09:14.260 --> 03:09:18.100]  because the police and the social services didn't want to appear
[03:09:18.100 --> 03:09:22.340]  politically incorrect so it's not just the threat posed by
[03:09:22.340 --> 03:09:26.900]  you know isis members hiding amongst the refugees it's the threat posed by islamists
[03:09:26.900 --> 03:09:32.900]  who want to impose theocracy on the west which is bad news for secular
[03:09:32.900 --> 03:09:36.020]  democracy it's bad news for women it's bad news for
[03:09:36.020 --> 03:09:39.940]  minorities and it's bad news for freedom of speech
[03:09:39.940 --> 03:09:44.020]  for simply having the right to criticize a religion
[03:09:44.020 --> 03:09:47.940]  but tommy something that alex touched upon before the break
[03:09:47.940 --> 03:09:52.820]  we've got again in the uk muslim immigration has only increased under
[03:09:52.820 --> 03:09:57.220]  the conservative government which supposedly was put in power to stem it
[03:09:57.220 --> 03:10:02.980]  but why do thousands upon thousands of muslims move to european countries
[03:10:02.980 --> 03:10:06.820]  you know presumably to escape conditions in their own
[03:10:06.820 --> 03:10:10.020]  countries to escape that low quality of life
[03:10:10.020 --> 03:10:15.780]  only to recreate those conditions by moving into these muslim ghettos
[03:10:15.780 --> 03:10:19.700]  and refusing to integrate that really doesn't make much sense to me does it
[03:10:19.700 --> 03:10:23.060]  make much sense to you it doesn't but if you look at
[03:10:23.060 --> 03:10:26.980]  certain research in those countries like puse the statistics out of the way
[03:10:26.980 --> 03:10:30.260]  these people think you look at pakistan where 86 percent of them
[03:10:30.260 --> 03:10:33.460]  believe being an apostate should be punishable what
[03:10:33.460 --> 03:10:36.260]  you just have to look at their views on homosexuals their views on women all these
[03:10:36.260 --> 03:10:38.260]  sort of views that they're bringing them with them
[03:10:38.260 --> 03:10:41.300]  they have they've come with those views that's their mindset that's how they've
[03:10:41.300 --> 03:10:43.380]  been brought up that's what they've had drilled into them
[03:10:43.380 --> 03:10:47.700]  which is Islam Islam Islam which is incompatible with western democracy and
[03:10:47.700 --> 03:10:49.860]  freedom those those views are not going to work so
[03:10:49.860 --> 03:10:52.500]  they've come with those views i'm not just going to leave them at the door
[03:10:52.500 --> 03:10:54.980]  when they come into brim they're still going to hold those views
[03:10:54.980 --> 03:10:58.660]  they're going to look up upon our women that's filthy i just bumped into
[03:10:58.660 --> 03:11:01.940]  yesterday i bumped into a loot and sound football player and his and his partner
[03:11:01.940 --> 03:11:05.540]  his wife and um she told me the amount of times just going to our football
[03:11:05.540 --> 03:11:07.780]  stadium because our football stadium is in the muslim community
[03:11:07.780 --> 03:11:11.860]  the amount of times she's been sexually um had sexual remarks made her
[03:11:11.860 --> 03:11:15.620]  daily whenever she's there and women should just not have to part with this
[03:11:15.620 --> 03:11:18.580]  but that it's the mindset and the culture that we're important
[03:11:18.580 --> 03:11:22.660]  and and you're right in what you said because my biggest fear is not groups
[03:11:22.660 --> 03:11:25.780]  like angem chowdhury i think they're the stupid ones
[03:11:25.780 --> 03:11:28.180]  that are telling us what they're going to do the ones that are on the street
[03:11:28.180 --> 03:11:31.380]  corners telling us what they're going to do i don't fear them i fear the
[03:11:31.380 --> 03:11:34.420]  extremely clever ones who have infiltrated government
[03:11:34.420 --> 03:11:38.020]  infiltrated political parties we saw it with afsal amin afsal amin was a
[03:11:38.020 --> 03:11:42.660]  conservative muslim mp who um who actually was working
[03:11:42.660 --> 03:11:46.420]  we found out was a radical for 10 years a plan within the government
[03:11:46.420 --> 03:11:50.740]  um they're the ones i fear and and you're right forget terrorism
[03:11:50.740 --> 03:11:54.260]  even if you take terrorism out of the equation the future is not right anyway
[03:11:54.260 --> 03:11:59.060]  but then the more islam the more muslims when islam becomes a dominant culture
[03:11:59.060 --> 03:12:02.340]  in your community we have a problem we have a big problem and that's not
[03:12:02.340 --> 03:12:05.460]  fashionist extremist or racist in any way to say that to say that we want to
[03:12:05.460 --> 03:12:08.980]  protect this country we want to protect the christian judo christian culture
[03:12:08.980 --> 03:12:13.780]  that we we've inherited our grandparents um
[03:12:13.780 --> 03:12:16.820]  it's not racist or bigot but in this country even just saying that is seen
[03:12:16.820 --> 03:12:21.700]  extreme and the point that i've made over and over again
[03:12:21.700 --> 03:12:25.700]  this is a religion that kills people who try to leave
[03:12:25.700 --> 03:12:29.860]  how is that any different from a cult and as he said you look at the polls
[03:12:29.860 --> 03:12:33.700]  in these middle eastern south asian countries the vast majority of people
[03:12:33.700 --> 03:12:36.740]  support that belief they're coming into the west they're
[03:12:36.740 --> 03:12:41.060]  importing these beliefs with them we're importing a real rape culture
[03:12:41.060 --> 03:12:44.900]  while the feminists whine about you know in america for example a college rape
[03:12:44.900 --> 03:12:47.860]  culture that doesn't exist is a complete fraud
[03:12:47.860 --> 03:12:51.860]  meanwhile the west is importing a real rape culture complete silence from
[03:12:51.860 --> 03:12:55.220]  feminists on that score but after you know charlie
[03:12:55.220 --> 03:12:58.900]  hebdo there was a huge protest in pakistan from
[03:12:58.900 --> 03:13:02.580]  muslims in support of the charlie hebdo jihadists
[03:13:02.580 --> 03:13:06.180]  so we hear this over and over again and the left has turned it into a kind of
[03:13:06.180 --> 03:13:09.460]  cliche where for example when there's a like a dylan
[03:13:09.460 --> 03:13:11.940]  roof mass shooting they say oh where are all the
[03:13:11.940 --> 03:13:16.420]  moderate christians denouncing this and well in most cases they do denounce it
[03:13:16.420 --> 03:13:20.660]  but for example in pakistan they get out on the street they don't decry
[03:13:20.660 --> 03:13:23.700]  charlie hebdo they don't decry the paris massacre
[03:13:23.700 --> 03:13:26.900]  they support it and many of the polls show that
[03:13:26.900 --> 03:13:32.340]  so what do you think prevents so-called moderate muslims from speaking out
[03:13:32.340 --> 03:13:37.460]  against islamist terror is it just fear of reprisals because it's basically
[03:13:37.460 --> 03:13:40.980]  full or is it something more it's a combination of things it's a combination
[03:13:40.980 --> 03:13:43.300]  of things that look after charlie hebdo massacre
[03:13:43.300 --> 03:13:47.380]  30 000 british muslims marched through the city of
[03:13:47.380 --> 03:13:50.660]  birmingham which is where we're going to be holding up our silent walk on the
[03:13:50.660 --> 03:13:52.660]  6th of february they marched through the city of
[03:13:52.660 --> 03:13:56.340]  birmingham demanding blasphemy laws in support again of charlie hebdo's
[03:13:56.340 --> 03:13:59.060]  killers they didn't march against the killers they didn't march
[03:13:59.060 --> 03:14:01.380]  against ices as we've seen they don't come out on the streets now
[03:14:01.380 --> 03:14:04.100]  so it's a combination of things it's a combination of things that
[03:14:04.100 --> 03:14:07.700]  i believe 30 percent of british muslims felt they were justified
[03:14:07.700 --> 03:14:10.500]  the killings so that's 30 percent that are certainly not going to come out on
[03:14:10.500 --> 03:14:13.220]  protest and that 30 percent will probably relate to the other ones aren't
[03:14:13.220 --> 03:14:17.300]  going to come out on protest so it's and then there is a genuine fear
[03:14:17.300 --> 03:14:20.580]  in the community as well which is justified because when we're talking
[03:14:20.580 --> 03:14:23.540]  about apostates we've seen recently the apostate in bradford
[03:14:23.540 --> 03:14:27.300]  who's been targeted for the last 10 years there's no charities to help these
[03:14:27.300 --> 03:14:29.780]  people there's no government schemes to help people
[03:14:29.780 --> 03:14:33.140]  leave islam which we should be doing in a similar way we have
[03:14:33.140 --> 03:14:36.660]  government schemes especially in scandinavia to help gang members leave
[03:14:36.660 --> 03:14:39.140]  the gang because they'll be targeted by that gang
[03:14:39.140 --> 03:14:42.500]  now in islam if you try and leave you will be targeted
[03:14:42.500 --> 03:14:46.020]  there should be charities government support all sorts of ways
[03:14:46.020 --> 03:14:49.300]  of helping these people leave that flashes the ideology
[03:14:49.300 --> 03:14:53.780]  we don't see it again everything as soon as every issue you're about
[03:14:53.780 --> 03:14:57.940]  feminism animal rights whenever it comes to islam
[03:14:57.940 --> 03:15:00.980]  everyone remains silent and that's simply i think is
[03:15:00.980 --> 03:15:04.500]  is fear is paralyzing and people are scared
[03:15:04.500 --> 03:15:08.260]  and to be fair they've got a reason to be scared
[03:15:08.260 --> 03:15:11.460]  because the minute you do speak out if you're in a job or career
[03:15:11.460 --> 03:15:15.620]  you're probably going to lose it i'm sitting in the situation now six years
[03:15:15.620 --> 03:15:17.860]  on where they can't take anything more from me
[03:15:17.860 --> 03:15:21.620]  other than my life so i'm in the situation where i'll stay it
[03:15:21.620 --> 03:15:25.380]  and you yourself you'll say there's not many people out there
[03:15:25.380 --> 03:15:30.580]  and i don't blame them because they've watched what happens to people who do
[03:15:30.580 --> 03:15:34.420]  who do exercise their freedom of speech who do who do decide to criticise islam
[03:15:34.420 --> 03:15:37.540]  they've seen the backlash it's like for example when i walk through my hometown
[03:15:37.540 --> 03:15:40.660]  i get punched on the nose regularly or i get violently attacked
[03:15:40.660 --> 03:15:42.820]  i quite understand that the local politician probably doesn't want to get
[03:15:42.820 --> 03:15:45.140]  punched on the nose or attacked every time he walks through the sound
[03:15:45.140 --> 03:15:49.860]  so he chooses to remain silent so it's a combination of things
[03:15:49.860 --> 03:15:54.020]  it's a difficult a difficult situation what you actually see now in europe is
[03:15:54.020 --> 03:15:58.260]  the countries that are coming out freely and talking about these issues
[03:15:58.260 --> 03:16:03.140]  Czech Republic Slovakia Hungary Poland that the countries have not been
[03:16:03.140 --> 03:16:06.100]  infiltrated and infected with islamic immigration
[03:16:06.100 --> 03:16:11.620]  and and that the influence islam has in our countries when we look at previous
[03:16:11.620 --> 03:16:14.900]  world leaders if we want to look at sir William Gladstone for example who
[03:16:14.900 --> 03:16:18.740]  who their statues off across our capital city he held the Quran above his head
[03:16:18.740 --> 03:16:21.860]  in the houses of parliament and he said there will never be peace on this earth
[03:16:21.860 --> 03:16:25.300]  so long as we have this book it's a violent and a cursed book
[03:16:25.300 --> 03:16:28.900]  Winston Churchill said islam in a man is similar to rabies in a dog he said
[03:16:28.900 --> 03:16:33.140]  individual muslims which they do will show great great
[03:16:33.140 --> 03:16:37.220]  great individual there's great individual things about about them but
[03:16:37.220 --> 03:16:41.620]  the power of islam has has the power to bring europe back into the dark ages
[03:16:41.620 --> 03:16:45.220]  these were world leaders now if there were no muslims in britain
[03:16:45.220 --> 03:16:47.940]  and we didn't have the influence of saudi whoever was leading our country
[03:16:47.940 --> 03:16:50.340]  would be saying something similar right now they'd be coming out saying what
[03:16:50.340 --> 03:16:52.900]  donald trump said they'll be coming out saying what what the check
[03:16:52.900 --> 03:16:55.380]  president said they'll be coming out saying what her hungarian leaders are
[03:16:55.380 --> 03:16:58.740]  saying they wouldn't be accepting the refugee quotas but because we have
[03:16:58.740 --> 03:17:03.060]  islam everywhere in this country in every political party
[03:17:03.060 --> 03:17:06.500]  in every government position in every government job and that's only at four
[03:17:06.500 --> 03:17:11.540]  percent so we really need to wake up to to where this country's headed
[03:17:11.540 --> 03:17:16.500]  and again completely debunking this religion of peace tag if it's a
[03:17:16.500 --> 03:17:21.060]  religion of peace why do its most prominent critics like yourself
[03:17:21.060 --> 03:17:24.180]  have panic buttons why are they attacked on the street
[03:17:24.180 --> 03:17:28.100]  why are they oppressed by the government when they speak out against this
[03:17:28.100 --> 03:17:31.700]  again it completely debunks that notion but just in the final couple of minutes
[03:17:31.700 --> 03:17:34.260]  here tell people how they can get the book and

[03:18:28.660 --> 03:18:31.860]  to apologize for it because there was a hell of a lot of anger and frustration
[03:18:31.860 --> 03:18:35.380]  that built up with years of resentment at being treated like second-class citizens
[03:18:35.380 --> 03:18:39.220]  having our daughters or our sisters raped terrorism
[03:18:39.220 --> 03:18:41.940]  islamic gangs out of control in the country so that

[03:24:17.860 --> 03:24:25.300]  earlier alex covered this article out of info was hundreds of refugees
[03:24:25.300 --> 03:24:29.940]  caught with images of isis flag severed heads on their phones
[03:24:29.940 --> 03:24:33.780]  those are asylum seekers coming into norway or
[03:24:33.780 --> 03:24:38.020]  orphans and widows as barack obama calls them now we've got another article
[03:24:38.020 --> 03:24:42.740]  which is even more shocking to me of israeli national news
[03:24:42.740 --> 03:24:47.220]  syrian migrant a la is great isis is greater
[03:24:47.220 --> 03:24:51.860]  italian police have arrested a syrian refugee for being a member of the islamic
[03:24:51.860 --> 03:24:55.940]  state organization flapping him in cuffs shortly after he arrived by
[03:24:55.940 --> 03:24:59.700]  bow along with hundreds of migrants media reports said monday
[03:24:59.700 --> 03:25:03.620]  the man reportedly in his 20s was arrested by officers at israeli
[03:25:03.620 --> 03:25:06.740]  after italy special operations division discovered
[03:25:06.740 --> 03:25:12.260]  incriminating material on his cell phone so we've got refugees coming into
[03:25:12.260 --> 03:25:14.740]  ice to coming into the netherland sorry
[03:25:14.740 --> 03:25:18.660]  bragging about the fact that they were fighting with al qaeda and isis being
[03:25:18.660 --> 03:25:21.620]  arrested you've got refugees coming into norway
[03:25:21.620 --> 03:25:26.580]  with pictures of isis flags and beheadings on their cell phones
[03:25:26.580 --> 03:25:29.860]  and now we've got another individual coming into italy
[03:25:29.860 --> 03:25:33.300]  again with isis symbols on his phone
[03:25:33.300 --> 03:25:38.820]  talking about a la is great isis is greater again emphasizing the fact that
[03:25:38.820 --> 03:25:43.140]  many of these refugees who again only one fifth syrian
[03:25:43.140 --> 03:25:47.940]  are coming in with these jihadist beliefs yet were told by obama by the
[03:25:47.940 --> 03:25:50.980]  political class that they're just orphans and widows
[03:25:50.980 --> 03:25:54.820]  and nothing to worry about as obama plans eventually to bring
[03:25:54.820 --> 03:25:58.580]  one hundred thousand of them into the united states
[03:25:58.580 --> 03:26:04.020]  but angela merkel says now she wants to drastically reduce refugee arrivals in
[03:26:04.020 --> 03:26:07.460]  germany this is out of the garden chancellor angela merkel
[03:26:07.460 --> 03:26:10.980]  wants to drastically decrease the number of refugees coming to germany
[03:26:10.980 --> 03:26:14.740]  signaling a compromise to critics of her open door policy
[03:26:14.740 --> 03:26:18.740]  and within her conservatives on the eve of a party congress
[03:26:18.740 --> 03:26:22.980]  so she's basically letting almost a million migrants into germany over the
[03:26:22.980 --> 03:26:28.100]  past four or five six months we have rape cases around these migrant camps
[03:26:28.100 --> 03:26:30.820]  exploding we have migrants attacking nurses and
[03:26:30.820 --> 03:26:34.180]  hospital workers who are giving them free health care
[03:26:34.180 --> 03:26:37.860]  and we have the authorities in germany covering up those reports
[03:26:37.860 --> 03:26:42.020]  in their own words so as not to legitimize critics of mass migration
[03:26:42.020 --> 03:26:46.180]  and now after they've lowered the drawbridge and let all this
[03:26:46.180 --> 03:26:51.860]  rape culture come into germany angela merkel time magazine person of the year
[03:26:51.860 --> 03:26:56.420]  finally says that maybe they've gone a little bit too far
[03:26:56.420 --> 03:27:00.100]  well again it's too little too late and again
[03:27:00.100 --> 03:27:03.460]  through facebook through twitter i receive these kind of messages from people
[03:27:03.460 --> 03:27:08.980]  every week people living in sweden denmark germany
[03:27:08.980 --> 03:27:12.580]  people who are living right next to these migrant camps and they always tell
[03:27:12.580 --> 03:27:16.020]  the same story we're frightened to go out in the streets
[03:27:16.020 --> 03:27:20.180]  these people just hang around they're violent they're intimidating
[03:27:20.180 --> 03:27:25.380]  they show no will no motivation to integrate into the local community
[03:27:25.380 --> 03:27:28.980]  of course now we have rape cases exploding so somebody sent this to me
[03:27:28.980 --> 03:27:33.540]  today my uncle he's 70 years old and has worked for the housing council
[03:27:33.540 --> 03:27:38.100]  for many decades in stuttgart germany last night he stated that
[03:27:38.100 --> 03:27:42.100]  people are being severely lied to legions are arriving daily
[03:27:42.100 --> 03:27:45.460]  and the destruction in their wake is difficult to describe
[03:27:45.460 --> 03:27:50.180]  his own kids who are in their late 30s are terrified to go out and do their
[03:27:50.180 --> 03:27:53.540]  regular business the thefts and assaults are not being
[03:27:53.540 --> 03:27:58.980]  supported so again more anecdotes evidence and i get these messages every
[03:27:58.980 --> 03:28:03.220]  week now that this migrant culture that they're importing into these european
[03:28:03.220 --> 03:28:07.460]  countries is not only leading to social upheaval it's
[03:28:07.460 --> 03:28:10.660]  it's a direct criminal threat to the population
[03:28:10.660 --> 03:28:14.820]  there's a village not far from where i live of 150 people
[03:28:14.820 --> 03:28:21.300]  they're about to bring in 200 migrants the collapsing population of village
[03:28:21.300 --> 03:28:24.740]  to live in a center right in the middle of that village
[03:28:24.740 --> 03:28:29.060]  which doesn't even have a shop it's a tiny little handler
[03:28:29.060 --> 03:28:32.260]  and these these thoughts of migrants are being brought in
[03:28:32.260 --> 03:28:35.860]  by government order basically in league with the local council
[03:28:35.860 --> 03:28:39.060]  people are freaking out they're starting campaigns about
[03:28:39.060 --> 03:28:43.460]  and it's interesting to consider you know in the united kingdom we had
[03:28:43.460 --> 03:28:46.740]  what is it probably up to six seven hundred thousand now
[03:28:46.740 --> 03:28:51.700]  people signing this petition to ban donald trump from the uk for his comments
[03:28:51.700 --> 03:28:54.340]  on muslim immigration which will have no effect
[03:28:54.340 --> 03:28:58.820]  whatsoever on uk immigration policy but they signed the petition to virtue
[03:28:58.820 --> 03:29:01.300]  signal and looked trendy to all their friends
[03:29:01.300 --> 03:29:04.420]  but whenever the issue of one of these migrant
[03:29:04.420 --> 03:29:08.340]  influx has been you know 200 migrants being housed in one of these camps
[03:29:08.340 --> 03:29:14.180]  near where they live comes to bear all these people freak out they start
[03:29:14.180 --> 03:29:17.380]  aggressive campaigns to try to prevent it from happening
[03:29:17.380 --> 03:29:21.060]  so how many of these people in person vocally
[03:29:21.060 --> 03:29:24.420]  are saying yes we're great humanitarians let all the
[03:29:24.420 --> 03:29:28.420]  refugees come in while as when they actually come in
[03:29:28.420 --> 03:29:31.700]  they're writing letters they're freaking out they're starting campaigns to get
[03:29:31.700 --> 03:29:35.300]  rid of them and to not have that happen because in reality
[03:29:35.300 --> 03:29:39.700]  they know what it's all about they don't want to import that culture
[03:29:39.700 --> 03:29:44.740]  black for news after break it's the alice juncture fourth hour overdrive

[03:33:30.420 --> 03:33:33.380]  in a second we won't have time to play this clip but it's an article up on
[03:33:33.380 --> 03:33:37.060]  info wars dot com muslim congressman claims white two premises
[03:33:37.060 --> 03:33:41.460]  bigger threat than islamic terrorist muslim congressman andrey carc until
[03:33:41.460 --> 03:33:45.780]  the bc's this week the white supremacists represent a big bigger threat
[03:33:45.780 --> 03:33:49.860]  than islamic terrorists so again they're pushing this myth
[03:33:49.860 --> 03:33:53.380]  despite the fact you know we've had four hud boston bombing the oklahoma be
[03:33:53.380 --> 03:33:58.820]  heading garland chattanooga san bernadino all massacres carried out
[03:33:58.820 --> 03:34:02.980]  by islamist terrorists yet we've still got this narrative
[03:34:02.980 --> 03:34:06.820]  that the most potent terror threat is white supremacists
[03:34:06.820 --> 03:34:09.860]  the way they're doing this is they're first of all claiming that there are
[03:34:09.860 --> 03:34:12.900]  355 mass shootings this year that's been
[03:34:12.900 --> 03:34:17.460]  completely debunked the fbi says it's only 41 mass shootings this year
[03:34:17.460 --> 03:34:21.540]  they're taking that number of 355 claiming that
[03:34:21.540 --> 03:34:25.620]  these are all acts of domestic terrorism even though the vast majority of
[03:34:25.620 --> 03:34:28.900]  them have nothing to do with terrorism which is a political motive
[03:34:28.900 --> 03:34:32.740]  and then basically just blaming all white people for those shootings even
[03:34:32.740 --> 03:34:36.100]  though probably more than half of them are gang related
[03:34:36.100 --> 03:34:40.740]  again to deny the threat posed by islamist terror in america
[03:34:40.740 --> 03:34:44.900]  which again statistically is very low but it's certainly a lot higher
[03:34:44.900 --> 03:34:48.100]  than so-called white supremacists so check out that article
[03:34:48.100 --> 03:34:51.380]  up on info wars dot com i'm gonna go to a video now
[03:34:51.380 --> 03:34:55.620]  richard reed sat down with rob dew to talk about how
[03:34:55.620 --> 03:34:59.460]  the democrats are using secret political strategies to control
[03:34:59.460 --> 03:35:06.180]  republican candidates here's that clip
[03:35:06.180 --> 03:35:09.220]  guys sit next to me basically is instrumental in getting roger stone
[03:35:09.220 --> 03:35:12.980]  and donald trump onto the alex joneshow that's richard reed he's been a long
[03:35:12.980 --> 03:35:16.660]  time employee of info wars and we're going to be sending him out on the road
[03:35:16.660 --> 03:35:20.900]  to do some political correspondence in these republican primaries and
[03:35:20.900 --> 03:35:23.860]  democratic primaries and caucuses that are going to be happening in iowa
[03:35:23.860 --> 03:35:27.780]  new hampshire south carolina those are the big three that kind of set the
[03:35:27.780 --> 03:35:30.500]  tone for this but what we're going to be discussing today
[03:35:30.500 --> 03:35:33.700]  is how the democrats have actually infiltrated the republican party
[03:35:33.700 --> 03:35:36.660]  and they're going to be stealing this republican nomination
[03:35:36.660 --> 03:35:39.940]  away from donald trump for jeb bush and richard's going to be explaining how
[03:35:39.940 --> 03:35:42.180]  they're going to do that well right thank you for having me on and the
[03:35:42.180 --> 03:35:45.540]  democrats via the new world order definitely have a plan on how they're
[03:35:45.540 --> 03:35:49.460]  going to try to steal the selection they've adjusted primary dates they've
[03:35:49.460 --> 03:35:53.220]  adjusted the way the delegates are proportioned in some states winter
[03:35:53.220 --> 03:35:57.140]  take all in some states they're uh proportional so we really
[03:35:57.140 --> 03:36:01.540]  going to be having to watch for the dirty tricks by the gop
[03:36:01.540 --> 03:36:05.860]  and the rnc so we are really going to have to be on our toes and we saw this
[03:36:05.860 --> 03:36:10.100]  on the last two primary seasons with ron paul just basically getting iowa
[03:36:10.100 --> 03:36:13.140]  stolen from him uh like it was rick santorum in the
[03:36:13.140 --> 03:36:15.700]  last election where he suddenly came up with this uh
[03:36:15.700 --> 03:36:20.260]  fairy dust money to just blitz the area and and kind of steal that that not and
[03:36:20.260 --> 03:36:23.700]  then he disappeared he was just a ringer he was thrown in there to take away the
[03:36:23.700 --> 03:36:26.180]  momentum from ron paul so then no one could uh
[03:36:26.180 --> 03:36:29.140]  give him legitimacy kind of what they're doing with trump trump is an outsider
[03:36:29.140 --> 03:36:31.860]  compared to the rest of the gop establishment and they are afraid of
[03:36:31.860 --> 03:36:35.460]  that's right rob and even prior to that 2008 with huckabee that was a
[03:36:35.460 --> 03:36:39.940]  totally faster so yes now we can watch for the dirty tricks to be coming in
[03:36:39.940 --> 03:36:45.460]  the republicans are dead set on making sure that don trump does not get this
[03:36:45.460 --> 03:36:49.060]  nomination by that i mean the republican establishment along with the democrats
[03:36:49.060 --> 03:36:52.740]  that have infiltrated the party it's going to be
[03:36:52.740 --> 03:36:56.820]  really tricky to do this and what it was ultimately with this
[03:36:56.820 --> 03:37:00.820]  what's called the splitter strategy is we had the republicans gather
[03:37:00.820 --> 03:37:04.260]  up at some point in the past and they had a huddle and they decided you know
[03:37:04.260 --> 03:37:06.900]  what jeb bush is going to be our nominee for 2016
[03:37:06.900 --> 03:37:10.820]  how do we get that done so what they looked at is the splitter strategy
[03:37:10.820 --> 03:37:14.500]  we all know that one of the models of the new new world order is divide and
[03:37:14.500 --> 03:37:19.060]  conquer right so what they did is they came up with all these candidates that's
[03:37:19.060 --> 03:37:22.580]  why you have jeb bush that's why you have marco rubio that's why you have
[03:37:22.580 --> 03:37:26.100]  santorum and kasek and kasek is basically a hit man
[03:37:26.100 --> 03:37:29.060]  he's just brought in to just hit trump constantly
[03:37:29.060 --> 03:37:32.180]  no substance to his attacks he's basically worthless in the polls i mean
[03:37:32.180 --> 03:37:35.060]  he's pulling out like one percent maybe that's right that's his only job but
[03:37:35.060 --> 03:37:38.260]  he's still in it so for the glp he sits there and he's got plenty of money
[03:37:38.260 --> 03:37:41.780]  yeah he's well funded but he can sit there and hit the barb wire for the glp
[03:37:41.780 --> 03:37:45.700]  and keep attacking trump like a chihuahua that's a great analogy he's a
[03:37:45.700 --> 03:37:49.300]  world war one barb wire guy he jumps on it lets everybody else run over top of
[03:37:49.300 --> 03:37:53.380]  there you go so that's it so they came up with the splitter strategy
[03:37:53.380 --> 03:37:57.220]  but their splitter strategy didn't take into account donald trump
[03:37:57.220 --> 03:38:01.460]  that's true and that's the thing uh the splitter strategy before donald trump
[03:38:01.460 --> 03:38:05.060]  was that they would get jeb bush rick santorum uh they would get
[03:38:05.060 --> 03:38:07.940]  jindal they would get they they didn't mind even
[03:38:07.940 --> 03:38:10.980]  ted cruz and rand paul stepping in there because what they would do
[03:38:10.980 --> 03:38:15.620]  is bring in more candidates like huckabee like uh we talked about santorum to
[03:38:15.620 --> 03:38:19.620]  split their support because they did a lot of polling i remember getting a
[03:38:19.620 --> 03:38:23.700]  polling call back in 2006 during a governor's race here in
[03:38:23.700 --> 03:38:28.500]  texas i got a call a polling call would you like to see jeb bush as president
[03:38:28.500 --> 03:38:32.100]  that was back in 2006 that's nine years ago folks so that's how long
[03:38:32.100 --> 03:38:35.860]  the jeb bush being the nominee of the republican party in 2016 has been in the
[03:38:35.860 --> 03:38:39.300]  works because i got that call and so did a friend of mine
[03:38:39.300 --> 03:38:44.820]  and it was unbelievable so what they have done is since 2012 2013 2014
[03:38:44.820 --> 03:38:49.300]  the republican party with the democrats and the nwl have conspired to set up
[03:38:49.300 --> 03:38:54.420]  the splitter strategy where every time uh ted cruz gets in or rand paul gets in
[03:38:54.420 --> 03:38:57.940]  jeb bush gets in what they do is all right what other outside candidate
[03:38:57.940 --> 03:39:02.180]  that's with us with the gop establishment what other candidate can we bring in
[03:39:02.180 --> 03:39:05.300]  to help fracture and split those votes because they know
[03:39:05.300 --> 03:39:09.540]  bottom line the all the support that jeb bush can generate is between 15
[03:39:09.540 --> 03:39:13.780]  and 20 percent of the electorate so they actually devised a way
[03:39:13.780 --> 03:39:19.220]  by manipulating the way the primaries fall the the way the primary dates fall
[03:39:19.220 --> 03:39:23.860]  the way the delegates are proportioned or winner take all the way that works
[03:39:23.860 --> 03:39:27.380]  they've done all that to rig it so that jeb bush
[03:39:27.380 --> 03:39:32.020]  could have won with 15 to 25 percent of the electorate support that's all they
[03:39:32.020 --> 03:39:36.100]  made these rule changes what back in 2012 they started looking at those rules
[03:39:36.100 --> 03:39:39.620]  back in 2012 during the rnc convention back then
[03:39:39.620 --> 03:39:44.180]  uh many people know about how ron paul got ripped off back in the 2012 election
[03:39:44.180 --> 03:39:47.620]  they made those rule changes back then and they also kept modifying and tinkering
[03:39:47.620 --> 03:39:52.420]  and tweaking like a sculpture carefully chipping away all right how can we
[03:39:52.420 --> 03:39:55.780]  set it up we know jeb bush can only get 15 to 25 percent of the electorate to
[03:39:55.780 --> 03:39:59.860]  vote for him and come and support him in in the delegate
[03:39:59.860 --> 03:40:03.060]  race so we got to rig it to where he can
[03:40:03.060 --> 03:40:06.660]  still beat everybody by fracturing the vote so that's what they've done and
[03:40:06.660 --> 03:40:09.700]  that's like say that's before they figured and calculated how donald
[03:40:09.700 --> 03:40:13.140]  trump was going to step in sitting next to me is richard reeves he is our i guess
[03:40:13.140 --> 03:40:16.100]  you could say our political operative of the bunch he's been involved in the
[03:40:16.100 --> 03:40:19.460]  political process since uh 2008 even before that
[03:40:19.460 --> 03:40:23.220]  when ross perot was running and we saw what happened when ross perot ran
[03:40:23.220 --> 03:40:26.740]  everybody liked his ideas but he didn't quite by getting out of the race and
[03:40:26.740 --> 03:40:31.220]  getting back in he lost that momentum which led to a bill clinton election in
[03:40:31.220 --> 03:40:34.260]  eight years of bill clinton we could even see the same thing if
[03:40:34.260 --> 03:40:37.300]  they're able to uh get trump out of the
[03:40:37.300 --> 03:40:40.660]  nomination process for the republican party he runs independent
[03:40:40.660 --> 03:40:44.660]  and there's just not enough support there for people wanting to jump ship out
[03:40:44.660 --> 03:40:47.940]  of the democrat or rhino uh you know two-party system
[03:40:47.940 --> 03:40:51.060]  and so we get a hillary clinton or a jeb bush i mean either way we're going to
[03:40:51.060 --> 03:40:53.620]  lose with that but getting back you were talking
[03:40:53.620 --> 03:40:56.420]  about the splitter strategy how they've saturated the field but they didn't
[03:40:56.420 --> 03:40:59.620]  count on trump coming in right that's right they didn't count on trump and
[03:40:59.620 --> 03:41:02.420]  to back up what you said a minute ago talking about ross bro this is very
[03:41:02.420 --> 03:41:05.460]  important this is very key this is why third party efforts
[03:41:05.460 --> 03:41:08.580]  are a negative thing the democrat and republican parties
[03:41:08.580 --> 03:41:11.460]  with the help of the nwo and all their money and their financiers
[03:41:11.460 --> 03:41:15.140]  has totally rigged the electorate system okay
[03:41:15.140 --> 03:41:19.860]  it's why third party has almost zero chance almost zero chance
[03:41:19.860 --> 03:41:23.380]  the democrat party republican party they have worked together and conspired
[03:41:23.380 --> 03:41:27.620]  at every state to make it almost impossible to even access the ballot
[03:41:27.620 --> 03:41:30.900]  so getting on a third party race and another thing and then you can't even
[03:41:30.900 --> 03:41:33.860]  get in the debates if you get on the you can't even get in the debate and even
[03:41:33.860 --> 03:41:37.460]  worse than that right now if for some reason don trump had to
[03:41:37.460 --> 03:41:41.620]  jump ship and run independent it would be kind of a disaster for us because as i
[03:41:41.620 --> 03:41:45.140]  was talking about earlier we're looking at potentially flushing a lot of these
[03:41:45.140 --> 03:41:49.380]  rhino incumbents down the tubes well if all of a sudden those people that were
[03:41:49.380 --> 03:41:52.980]  going to vote in the primaries for don trump abandon ship and go third party
[03:41:52.980 --> 03:41:56.580]  then all of a sudden we get the same rhinos the same entrenched establishment
[03:41:56.580 --> 03:42:00.180]  republicans the same entrenched establishment democrats
[03:42:00.180 --> 03:42:03.620]  talk about a disaster this is not just about don trump this is not just about
[03:42:03.620 --> 03:42:07.540]  the presidential candidates this is way way bigger than that
[03:42:07.540 --> 03:42:12.820]  if we go upstream of the voting process of the primary process the way the votes
[03:42:12.820 --> 03:42:16.500]  are counted there and if we go upstream of the general election process
[03:42:16.500 --> 03:42:19.940]  we go up to the headwaters of the political process
[03:42:19.940 --> 03:42:23.540]  that's where the candidates spawn from that's where they come from
[03:42:23.540 --> 03:42:26.660]  so what we need to do is be looking at that because
[03:42:26.660 --> 03:42:32.180]  that ironically it only takes a two or three percent minority of people
[03:42:32.180 --> 03:42:36.740]  to run that operation and then all of a sudden all these candidates
[03:42:36.740 --> 03:42:41.780]  the headwaters where they spawn from etc then dries up it dries up and a whole
[03:42:41.780 --> 03:42:45.220]  new slate of candidates you know people talk about black box voting and the
[03:42:45.220 --> 03:42:48.900]  fraud involved in that which is absolutely true we know about all that we
[03:42:48.900 --> 03:42:51.380]  know that there's fraud at so many levels in our government
[03:42:51.380 --> 03:42:54.100]  happened in florida when jeb was governor there you go the hanging chat
[03:42:54.100 --> 03:42:58.340]  election so it it just never ends how much fraud we find
[03:42:58.340 --> 03:43:01.540]  within the the government and the new world order and democrat republican
[03:43:01.540 --> 03:43:04.500]  party so getting up to those headwaters though where
[03:43:04.500 --> 03:43:09.220]  these candidates come from slowly but surely we're seeing better candidates
[03:43:09.220 --> 03:43:12.740]  arise we used to have one guy in the house that was liberty and freedom minded
[03:43:12.740 --> 03:43:16.660]  and that was wrong paul but now we've got the freedom liberty coalition in the
[03:43:16.660 --> 03:43:19.540]  house that consistently you know about 20 or 30 people
[03:43:19.540 --> 03:43:24.260]  30 or 30 members in the house well that's a long way from one you know we
[03:43:24.260 --> 03:43:27.700]  could double that in an election we could you know in this primary
[03:43:27.700 --> 03:43:32.100]  that is actually to me the most exciting facet of this whole thing right
[03:43:32.100 --> 03:43:36.660]  now is that we could see republican rhino incumbents the john banners in the
[03:43:36.660 --> 03:43:40.100]  republican party the paul rynes in the republican party
[03:43:40.100 --> 03:43:43.780]  they may not make it out of their primaries i'm really looking forward to
[03:43:43.780 --> 03:43:46.980]  that because you can see if you add up if you add
[03:43:46.980 --> 03:43:50.740]  up donald trump ted cruise ram paul
[03:43:50.740 --> 03:43:54.340]  fiorina perceived outside candidates we know they're not all outsiders but if you
[03:43:54.340 --> 03:43:57.940]  add up all these perceived outside candidates ben carson etc
[03:43:57.940 --> 03:44:01.700]  that right now if you add up those polls anybody can do it all day long 70
[03:44:01.700 --> 03:44:06.180]  percent right 70 of the republican voters are ready
[03:44:06.180 --> 03:44:08.980]  to do they're ready for real change we were talking about how we've got
[03:44:08.980 --> 03:44:11.620]  potential bombshell inside information that's right
[03:44:11.620 --> 03:44:15.620]  yeah so if trump does win the nomination what are they gonna pull if it
[03:44:15.620 --> 03:44:19.780]  looks like trump is going to win the nomination folks then the scuttle
[03:44:19.780 --> 03:44:25.460]  butt is the inside track rumor uh from sources that we have
[03:44:25.460 --> 03:44:31.060]  are that barack obama will either indict and or arrest
[03:44:31.060 --> 03:44:35.060]  hillary clinton right around the time of the democratic democratic national
[03:44:35.060 --> 03:44:38.820]  convention right about the time of the dnc and that what they will do is they
[03:44:38.820 --> 03:44:42.660]  will trot in joe biden who is no better than hillary we all know that
[03:44:42.660 --> 03:44:46.420]  but they somehow the powers be seem seem to think that joe biden
[03:44:46.420 --> 03:44:50.260]  could potentially beat donald trump and joe biden will have
[03:44:50.260 --> 03:44:53.220]  unlimited funds just as hillary would as a nominee
[03:44:53.220 --> 03:44:58.340]  so watch for that literally yank the lesbian witch out with a hook
[03:44:58.340 --> 03:45:02.740]  and install creepy uncle joe i mean and you look at
[03:45:02.740 --> 03:45:06.660]  any of those people i mean just totally worthless as as humans
[03:45:06.660 --> 03:45:10.340]  have no care at all for this country at all just want to drive us into the
[03:45:10.340 --> 03:45:14.180]  ground spit us out use us our energy just
[03:45:14.180 --> 03:45:17.300]  pull everything against us we got to do something so get involved in your
[03:45:17.300 --> 03:45:20.420]  political process out there there's no better time than now
[03:45:20.420 --> 03:45:23.300]  find out what the rules are because by the time these elections start i've been
[03:45:23.300 --> 03:45:27.700]  maybe too late to get involved absolutely
[03:45:27.700 --> 03:45:30.900]  so we're short on time so we're going to go straight to the next clip which is
[03:45:30.900 --> 03:45:35.940]  about the info wars solar base station a new product at info wars store.com
[03:45:35.940 --> 03:45:42.980]  is alex to talk about it this is just the the best vetted technology
[03:45:42.980 --> 03:45:46.020]  in solar panels for the price whether it's for your
[03:45:46.020 --> 03:45:49.620]  hunting shack or part of your house whatever the case is
[03:45:49.620 --> 03:45:53.140]  it is mobile like a suitcase you can roll around
[03:45:53.140 --> 03:45:56.900]  it's got the solar panels that come with it and the price
[03:45:56.900 --> 03:46:01.620]  is roughly half of the competitor and they don't even have as much power
[03:46:01.620 --> 03:46:04.820]  and it's not even the best solar panels it's just people keep shelling
[03:46:04.820 --> 03:46:09.380]  the stuff that's 10 years old this is the latest greatest for the price
[03:46:09.380 --> 03:46:13.380]  it is the info wars solar base station power supply
[03:46:13.380 --> 03:46:17.140]  and cj is here he volunteered to come in and talk about it
[03:46:17.140 --> 03:46:20.500]  also david knight ran in and pointed out you can get a federal tax credit for
[03:46:20.500 --> 03:46:23.940]  this system so so describe to us why you're such a fan
[03:46:23.940 --> 03:46:27.620]  of the info wars solar base station power supply tim fray j
[03:46:27.620 --> 03:46:30.660]  had recommended i speak about this because i've had some experience building
[03:46:30.660 --> 03:46:35.380]  homebrew solar systems essentially to supplement electrical cost
[03:46:35.380 --> 03:46:39.540]  and it's always been a lot more work than i felt it was worth
[03:46:39.540 --> 03:46:44.020]  simply because the cost of the panels the technology lagging behind
[03:46:44.020 --> 03:46:47.700]  and i think what's great about this is it's a monocrystalline panel
[03:46:47.700 --> 03:46:51.540]  instead of a polycrystalline panels which are simply separate pieces of
[03:46:51.540 --> 03:46:54.740]  material that absorb light and convert it to energy
[03:46:54.740 --> 03:46:59.140]  this is similar to perfect surface copper in electrical terms
[03:46:59.140 --> 03:47:03.060]  you get more more energy or more more efficiency
[03:47:03.060 --> 03:47:07.540]  out of a smoother surface and so the panels themselves are fantastic
[03:47:07.540 --> 03:47:11.700]  they'll fold in half it's about the size of a large slim suitcase
[03:47:11.700 --> 03:47:14.980]  the company that's building these wants to take over the market they don't want
[03:47:14.980 --> 03:47:18.340]  to put crap out not at all similar pieces of
[03:47:18.340 --> 03:47:21.780]  equipment go for about five thousand dollars so when i say it's half the cost
[03:47:21.780 --> 03:47:26.340]  that's that's it's way way less than half the quality of the batteries i
[03:47:26.340 --> 03:47:30.740]  think is is fantastic because it's a lithium iron
[03:47:30.740 --> 03:47:37.140]  or lithium ferro ferrous type cell it's it's going to last a lot longer than a
[03:47:37.140 --> 03:47:40.740]  lithium polymer or a conventional lithium ion
[03:47:40.740 --> 03:47:45.140]  its discharge rate is going to be a little bit slower
[03:47:45.140 --> 03:47:48.340]  but because of what it is and because the durability you get a lot more
[03:47:48.340 --> 03:47:52.660]  charges and discharges out of this kind of cell i think i believe it's up to
[03:47:52.660 --> 03:47:57.220]  two thousand let's just be clear there's only 98 of these i should
[03:47:57.220 --> 03:48:01.140]  say because i'm getting two of myself i mean this is this is well
[03:48:01.140 --> 03:48:04.820]  you got to have this one in your house is back up and also one portable when you
[03:48:04.820 --> 03:48:08.260]  go camping or whatever i mean this is i keep using the term because that's what
[03:48:08.260 --> 03:48:12.740]  i tell my guys i want game changers i want the best reviewed highest quality
[03:48:12.740 --> 03:48:16.500]  bang for your buck companies that are aggressively wanting to dominate markets
[03:48:16.500 --> 03:48:19.620]  who don't just want to be you know sitting on their laurels and the folks we
[03:48:19.620 --> 03:48:23.140]  got this from are awesome we private labeled it to also have this price
[03:48:23.140 --> 03:48:26.340]  the leading competitor is why i kept saying you know twice the cost
[03:48:26.340 --> 03:48:29.540]  is twice as much and doesn't even deliver as much power
[03:48:29.540 --> 03:48:32.820]  and people just don't know it's just being marketed and folks are buying it
[03:48:32.820 --> 03:48:37.460]  and i'm not being mean we would sell it we would sell other stuff if it was a
[03:48:37.460 --> 03:48:40.820]  good deal i will not sell you something i wouldn't buy
[03:48:40.820 --> 03:48:44.500]  that's all i'm saying tj i immediately thought of my grandmother when i saw it
[03:48:44.500 --> 03:48:50.500]  she lives in a very rural area has COPD has an oxygen machine
[03:48:50.500 --> 03:48:54.660]  has a CPAP and a nebulizer and when the power goes out
[03:48:54.660 --> 03:48:59.300]  they do have a generator it's noisy but it relies on a steady supply of gasoline
[03:48:59.300 --> 03:49:01.940]  and if you're snowed in and you can't get that
[03:49:01.940 --> 03:49:05.060]  the sun is still there and what makes it great is that even in overcast
[03:49:05.060 --> 03:49:09.220]  situations like you'll find in winter it's going to absorb
[03:49:09.220 --> 03:49:13.220]  almost as much as a conventional solar panel on a cloudy day
[03:49:13.220 --> 03:49:16.660]  along with an ac outlet you've got 12 volt outlets
[03:49:16.660 --> 03:49:21.780]  12 volts at i believe 20 amps so you can charge a car
[03:49:21.780 --> 03:49:25.300]  if you don't have a portable charger you and you have this in your car for
[03:49:25.300 --> 03:49:28.580]  example while traveling going hunting camping fishing
[03:49:28.580 --> 03:49:32.100]  and you need to charge a battery it's capable of that it does come with that
[03:49:32.100 --> 03:49:36.420]  LED work lamp which in the event of darkness you've
[03:49:36.420 --> 03:49:39.620]  got a full battery and you needed to work on something
[03:49:39.620 --> 03:49:43.540]  you've got light available it would be and a lot of panels fold together
[03:49:43.540 --> 03:49:47.140]  and and fits so nicely for transportability as well
[03:49:47.140 --> 03:49:50.500]  in durability it's it's got a protective casing around it most of the panels
[03:49:50.500 --> 03:49:54.340]  that i purchased in the past were very fragile you basically set
[03:49:54.340 --> 03:49:57.620]  them up somewhere and try not to touch them again
[03:49:57.620 --> 03:50:01.540]  because they're subject to cracking this is very very
[03:50:01.540 --> 03:50:04.660]  sturdy for people that want to really have portable
[03:50:04.660 --> 03:50:08.740]  power these are amazing units and it's something not just for preparedness
[03:50:08.740 --> 03:50:13.220]  but just for everyday life it's very very very very very exciting
[03:50:13.220 --> 03:50:16.900]  it is for everyday life you can put one of these in your house and in some
[03:50:16.900 --> 03:50:20.500]  states you qualify for a tax credit up to 30 of the cost
[03:50:20.500 --> 03:50:24.020]  some states would require that you somehow permanently attach it or hire
[03:50:24.020 --> 03:50:27.060]  an electrician to run the leads in it's not necessary
[03:50:27.060 --> 03:50:31.220]  and for safety to hire an electrician for the dc leads being that it's dc low
[03:50:31.220 --> 03:50:35.060]  voltage it's not a huge fire risk but in order to qualify for a tax credit
[03:50:35.060 --> 03:50:37.780]  you may want to look into it contact an accountant but
[03:50:37.780 --> 03:50:41.780]  even for home use if you'd like to have shave maybe a few
[03:50:41.780 --> 03:50:45.940]  dozen dollars off of your electric bill i think it would be quite effective
[03:50:45.940 --> 03:50:50.660]  absolutely so if you did use this over a year or so you'd get your money back
[03:50:50.660 --> 03:50:53.780]  more than likely you'd certainly get the peace of mind back that's
[03:50:53.780 --> 03:50:57.380]  that's certain this is definitely a great christmas gift to your family

[03:53:59.700 --> 03:54:16.900]  final segment of the fourth hour overdrive of the alex joneshow
[03:54:16.900 --> 03:54:21.780]  trump schools pompous saudi prince has your country taken any of the syrian
[03:54:21.780 --> 03:54:25.620]  refugees of course over the weekend we have a saudi prince
[03:54:25.620 --> 03:54:30.260]  lecture donald trump on human rights this is the country that has
[03:54:30.260 --> 03:54:35.380]  100 000 air conditioned tents sitting empty for most of the year
[03:54:35.380 --> 03:54:40.660]  that could house three million refugees how many refugees are saudi arabia
[03:54:40.660 --> 03:54:45.460]  taken in zero and yet they're lecturing trump on his human
[03:54:45.460 --> 03:54:49.300]  rights credentials this is the country that beheads gay
[03:54:49.300 --> 03:54:53.220]  people they stone rape victims to death
[03:54:53.220 --> 03:54:56.500]  and they're lecturing donald trump saying that he's hateful
[03:54:56.500 --> 03:55:00.500]  for calling for a temporary limitation on muslim immigration
[03:55:00.500 --> 03:55:04.820]  and again it's done very little to affect his poll numbers in fact
[03:55:04.820 --> 03:55:09.060]  politico is reporting trump hits a new high in national poll donald trump just
[03:55:09.060 --> 03:55:12.340]  got a little more vault in his ceiling nationwide the polling obsessed
[03:55:12.340 --> 03:55:15.940]  manhattan multi billionaire and leading republican presidential candidate
[03:55:15.940 --> 03:55:21.300]  broke into the 40s on monday so as a result of these comments which again
[03:55:21.300 --> 03:55:24.740]  half of the leftists said oh this is finally going to be the issue that
[03:55:24.740 --> 03:55:28.340]  thinks donald trump his poll numbers have only
[03:55:28.340 --> 03:55:32.100]  shot up again there's still a debate over whether he can
[03:55:32.100 --> 03:55:35.540]  defeat hillary clinton in a hypothetical head-to-head
[03:55:35.540 --> 03:55:39.540]  when it comes down to it he is making strides in that department
[03:55:39.540 --> 03:55:42.740]  his previous numbers show that he was down as much as 15
[03:55:42.740 --> 03:55:47.380]  percent on hillary a more recent poll shows that he's ahead or
[03:55:47.380 --> 03:55:52.180]  just behind so that seems to be changing as well we also had an article i believe
[03:55:52.180 --> 03:55:55.780]  it's on friday muslim who threatened knife attack on
[03:55:55.780 --> 03:55:59.300]  trump get secret service visit now of course this was the muslim guy who put
[03:55:59.300 --> 03:56:03.460]  up a youtube video maniacally waving knives around threatening to
[03:56:03.460 --> 03:56:08.100]  circumcise donald trump in a separate video he threatens to shoot
[03:56:08.100 --> 03:56:12.420]  anybody who links the religion of islam with isis
[03:56:12.420 --> 03:56:16.020]  those videos are still up on youtube where he's actually threatening to
[03:56:16.020 --> 03:56:19.620]  attack public figures they haven't been age restricted
[03:56:19.620 --> 03:56:23.540]  they haven't been deleted whereas my video for example on the
[03:56:23.540 --> 03:56:26.820]  charlie hebdo massacre which merely showed a screenshot
[03:56:26.820 --> 03:56:29.620]  of one of the police officers who was later killed
[03:56:29.620 --> 03:56:34.180]  was censored was deleted off of youtube so again it comes back to this
[03:56:34.180 --> 03:56:38.020]  standard of quote hateful rhetoric from the right
[03:56:38.020 --> 03:56:41.700]  and left being treated differently they just had a
[03:56:41.700 --> 03:56:44.740]  a video out of paul and origan which we had up on the website
[03:56:44.740 --> 03:56:50.260]  where they're bashing donald trump piñata with kids while cussing in front of them
[03:56:50.260 --> 03:56:54.340]  and basically saying that the kids can reenact killing donald trump
[03:56:54.340 --> 03:56:57.940]  now that might have been a bit of fun it obviously wasn't hate speech
[03:56:57.940 --> 03:57:02.420]  but again imagine if a tea party group had had an event where they
[03:57:02.420 --> 03:57:08.020]  held up a severed head of a mock obama and were joking about killing obama
[03:57:08.020 --> 03:57:12.180]  i mean people who have had parades which show obama as a zombie
[03:57:12.180 --> 03:57:17.220]  have been investigated by the fbi and yet this guy who's threatening to attack
[03:57:17.220 --> 03:57:20.740]  donald trump who remember is under secret service protection
[03:57:20.740 --> 03:57:25.060]  gets a visit from the secret service he merely says oh i don't want to talk to
[03:57:25.060 --> 03:57:28.740]  you they leave him alone and again the videos are still up
[03:57:28.740 --> 03:57:33.700]  on youtube we also had the aclu leader who called
[03:57:33.700 --> 03:57:37.140]  for killing donald trump supporters last week
[03:57:37.140 --> 03:57:42.420]  he's resigned of his own accord but again no massive backlash to that
[03:57:42.420 --> 03:57:46.500]  again i made a video about the religion of islam saying it's not a religion of
[03:57:46.500 --> 03:57:49.620]  peace which again is blasphemy to the left
[03:57:49.620 --> 03:57:53.620]  somebody reported me to the police in the united kingdom
[03:57:53.620 --> 03:57:57.380]  for what they said was an online hate crime
[03:57:57.380 --> 03:58:01.060]  for merely analyzing sharia law and saying that
[03:58:01.060 --> 03:58:05.620]  stoning female rape victims to death beheading gay people
[03:58:05.620 --> 03:58:09.540]  killing people who leave the religion of islam was probably
[03:58:09.540 --> 03:58:13.940]  indicative of the fact that islam is not a religion of peace
[03:58:13.940 --> 03:58:17.940]  i get reported to the police for that whereas islamic hate preachers in the
[03:58:17.940 --> 03:58:21.300]  uk can call for stoning homosexuals to death nothing
[03:58:21.300 --> 03:58:24.740]  happens to them again complete double standard
[03:58:24.740 --> 03:58:28.740]  that's gonna wrap it up for today's show though we'll be back with the info wars
[03:58:28.740 --> 03:58:32.420]  night news of course live show tomorrow 11 to 2 that's
