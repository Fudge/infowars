[00:00.000 --> 00:11.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.520 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:30.920]  Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome we are live it is
[00:30.920 --> 00:37.320]  Tuesday the 16th day of March 2010 we're gonna be live here for the next four
[00:37.320 --> 00:44.640]  hours we're going to take a look coming up in the third hour today at what the
[00:44.640 --> 00:49.000]  drug war has done to this nation Mexico China and many other countries
[00:49.000 --> 00:53.560]  how it's designed to take over societies with Kevin Booth the maker of
[00:53.560 --> 00:59.000]  American drug war and how we'd won the West Webster Tarpley on his belief from
[00:59.000 --> 01:03.800]  some of the preparatory conditioning he's seeing and the legislation that's
[01:03.800 --> 01:08.520]  been introduced that they may stage a false flag attack on the internet we'll
[01:08.520 --> 01:13.280]  also talk with the Webster Tarpley an economist on Moody's saying the US and
[01:13.280 --> 01:19.520]  England are probably gonna lose their triple a rating for the bonds which will
[01:19.520 --> 01:24.520]  cause the dollar to plunge downward in a big way so a host of issues with
[01:24.520 --> 01:32.200]  Webster Tarpley also more drums being beaten for war with Iran more military
[01:32.200 --> 01:38.880]  hardware being prepositioned ahead of an attack we'll be breaking that down we're
[01:38.880 --> 01:44.360]  gonna have open phones throughout the full four hours today I haven't even
[01:44.360 --> 01:46.640]  launched into some of the news will be covering but let me just give you the
[01:46.640 --> 01:57.080]  toll-free number 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 open phones throughout the
[01:57.080 --> 02:07.320]  four hours today okay one big report that we're going to be getting into is
[02:07.320 --> 02:16.120]  Pentagon targets WikiLeaks of course we reported on this yesterday today the
[02:16.120 --> 02:22.960]  register newspapers reporting on it US Army considered attack on WikiLeaks and
[02:22.960 --> 02:28.840]  on the web itself they see anyone basically criticizing the government or
[02:28.840 --> 02:33.160]  exposing corruption as terrorists now this is not the first time the Pentagon
[02:33.160 --> 02:37.760]  has said this and the Pentagon is taking over the web through cybersecurity
[02:37.760 --> 02:45.000]  right now and it's been coming out on WikiLeaks that the Pentagon has
[02:45.000 --> 02:50.320]  illegally spied on American citizens so of course they're upset people are
[02:50.320 --> 02:55.240]  exposing the criminal activity but hey the Pentagon's taken over literally
[02:55.240 --> 02:59.040]  hundreds of countries and put dictators into power why not take America over
[02:59.040 --> 03:03.960]  course you're a traitor if you say that like president Dwight D Eisenhower when
[03:03.960 --> 03:07.560]  he warned that the Pentagon would try to take over the United States under the
[03:07.560 --> 03:11.960]  control of the corporations that fund it and run it we're not talking about our
[03:11.960 --> 03:18.080]  military itself but the people that control it so that is coming up here's
[03:18.080 --> 03:24.080]  BBC headline US plans to fight the net revealed the net period the BBC got it
[03:24.080 --> 03:29.280]  right this is an attack on the internet itself and they've got their co-intell
[03:29.280 --> 03:32.320]  prooperatives out there on the web stirring up trouble they talk in these
[03:32.320 --> 03:38.520]  documents about knocking us off our center of balance attacking any website
[03:38.520 --> 03:43.400]  or any leader who is out there exposing the Pentagon's illegal illegal
[03:43.400 --> 03:47.880]  activities how to shut them down how to demonize them how to go after them how
[03:47.880 --> 03:53.640]  to confuse people just standard Pentagon operations here but now revealed in
[03:53.640 --> 04:00.840]  spades we're then going to get into Obama supports DNA sampling upon arrest
[04:00.840 --> 04:05.240]  and how that dovetails with Dallas Morning News Dallas police seek blood
[04:05.240 --> 04:10.480]  tests for all DUI suspects just no warrant no nothing they just take your
[04:10.480 --> 04:15.000]  blood and that's I guess why the Austin police chiefs we started this in Texas
[04:15.000 --> 04:19.560]  now probably gonna move on to be Dallas police chief the vampiric art a
[04:19.560 --> 04:25.480]  saveta continuing here more on Bloomberg US UK move closer to losing
[04:25.480 --> 04:28.800]  rating I know I mentioned that but I want to get to that before Tarpley joins
[04:28.800 --> 04:34.920]  us also house may try to pass health care bill without voting on it we
[04:34.920 --> 04:38.440]  reported this two weeks ago in Pelosi started floating the idea but now it
[04:38.440 --> 04:41.400]  looks like they're going to do it the Washington Post is saying this is no
[04:41.400 --> 04:44.640]  big deal completely normal no it's completely illegal but you have a lawless
[04:44.640 --> 04:51.560]  government also CNBC reports housing market sure to double dip oh yes the

[06:11.560 --> 06:16.080]  rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our
[06:16.080 --> 06:20.280]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's
[06:20.280 --> 06:25.520]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. For the
[06:25.520 --> 06:30.680]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held
[06:30.680 --> 06:35.000]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[06:35.000 --> 06:39.200]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists they're asking for more matches and the
[06:39.200 --> 06:42.880]  Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does
[06:42.880 --> 06:48.880]  care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get

[08:04.400 --> 08:12.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[08:12.160 --> 08:19.720]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[08:19.720 --> 08:23.240]  Alex Jones.
[08:34.360 --> 08:41.560]  It is Tuesday the 16th day of March 2010. We're gonna have wide open phones
[08:41.560 --> 08:45.360]  throughout the four hours of broadcast and we have two guests joining us later
[08:45.360 --> 08:51.640]  in the broadcast that are listed up at infowars.com as they are each day right
[08:51.640 --> 08:57.040]  before we go live. Okay I went over a little bit of the news just some of the
[08:57.040 --> 09:00.680]  headlines in the last short segment but I want to go back over the headlines and
[09:00.680 --> 09:05.360]  then just launch right into your calls then I will retrograde back into each of
[09:05.360 --> 09:10.880]  these important stories in more detail throughout the broadcast. I've been getting
[09:10.880 --> 09:17.360]  a lot of emails the last week or two about a story that first came up in the
[09:17.360 --> 09:22.680]  examiner. There were others from the Patriot Room others from World Net
[09:22.680 --> 09:30.680]  Daily said did Hillary really pledge U.S. homes to China? State Department says
[09:30.680 --> 09:39.160]  no basis for claim imminent domain rights offered as collateral for debt and I
[09:39.160 --> 09:43.880]  want to go over this. I mean briefly I'll tell you this. I don't know if Hillary
[09:43.880 --> 09:50.080]  really did this because they're denying it but we know that back when they
[09:50.080 --> 09:57.840]  handed over 20 plus U.S. ports to Dubai, Dubai World, a subsidiary of the Dubai
[09:57.840 --> 10:03.960]  government it's quasi private public that it was in the news that well we have
[10:03.960 --> 10:07.720]  to do this because they own our debt and we've got to give them something real
[10:07.720 --> 10:12.400]  as collateral because they know these dollars really aren't worth anything and
[10:12.400 --> 10:18.320]  as the dollar is devalued that is only going to get more and more intense.
[10:21.160 --> 10:29.680]  And we know that in the third world the IMF and World Bank make the country sign
[10:29.680 --> 10:39.720]  a 112 section agreement. That's just one of the variants where they agree when
[10:39.720 --> 10:44.120]  they take say a five billion dollar loan to not pay it back to keep part of it
[10:44.120 --> 10:48.800]  for themselves and then to hand over at 30% interest all the land all the
[10:48.800 --> 10:53.560]  national parks all the coal all the diamonds all the gold the roads the
[10:53.560 --> 10:57.560]  infrastructure the power plants all the supposed state-owned things that
[10:57.560 --> 11:04.160]  taxpayers have paid for over the decades the entire infrastructure and of
[11:04.160 --> 11:07.720]  course you saw an example of this in Greece where the German government came
[11:07.720 --> 11:13.320]  out and said we want your national parks we want your Parthenon we want your
[11:13.320 --> 11:20.800]  islands we want it all they come in loan them fiat money get the country to
[11:20.800 --> 11:26.240]  invest the loaned money with Goldman Sachs and others in derivatives
[11:26.240 --> 11:30.120]  Goldman positions themselves before they pull the plug in 2008 that's been
[11:30.120 --> 11:34.240]  released in their own emails and court cases and lawsuits the clatchy
[11:34.240 --> 11:38.560]  newspapers and others and then they've already positioned themselves to be safe
[11:38.560 --> 11:42.960]  when the country goes belly up through fraud the Ponzi scheme and operators
[11:42.960 --> 11:47.160]  come back with more money that's fiat and say look we'll give you more loans
[11:47.160 --> 11:51.880]  to get out of this crisis so it's just basic loan sharking mafia tactics our
[11:51.880 --> 11:58.160]  countries run by loan sharks by criminals and so of course this is in the
[11:58.160 --> 12:06.800]  agreements of course that's why back in 1994 5 6 7 8 Clinton didn't just give
[12:06.800 --> 12:13.800]  50 plus biosphere zones and it was more than 40 national heritage sites it was
[12:13.800 --> 12:17.960]  right up at about a hundred if I go from memory was 96 locations I cover that in
[12:17.960 --> 12:21.200]  my film America destroyed by design from the executive order but it was the
[12:21.200 --> 12:27.440]  buffer zones in some cases over a hundred miles out from all directions in
[12:27.440 --> 12:31.440]  the case of Yellowstone is in a buffer zone and the UN says you can't build on
[12:31.440 --> 12:35.520]  it you can't have a gold mine and then after a decade or so not being able to
[12:35.520 --> 12:41.200]  build UN controlled investors come and say we're allowed to build or dig merge
[12:41.200 --> 12:44.480]  with us or sell out your interest and you'll be able to get something and then
[12:44.480 --> 12:49.800]  the UN goes in and has a big gold mine so or a coal mine the case of the of
[12:49.800 --> 12:56.160]  Utah clean burning coal areas so as the same scam in Austin and they
[12:56.160 --> 13:05.000]  literally stole and in one city operation 20,000 acres one group was
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.840]  15,000 plus and in that case only took five years to break the people they went
[13:09.840 --> 13:14.120]  into hundreds of landowners ranches farmers out west of Austin very
[13:14.120 --> 13:19.040]  lucrative beautiful you know areas to build in and just say you can't build a
[13:19.040 --> 13:22.360]  stinking thing on a barn nothing we've passed an Austin ordinance it's for the
[13:22.360 --> 13:26.640]  salamander and then five years later they forced them to sell they just had a
[13:26.640 --> 13:29.880]  city imminent domain thing go through and they said look we're gonna pay a
[13:29.880 --> 13:32.280]  five six cents on the dollar for this and then they turned around and built
[13:32.280 --> 13:38.320]  huge hotels luxury spas condos and the city officials and their wives and
[13:38.320 --> 13:44.080]  children all openly own and run all of it it's just we steal it we own it we
[13:44.080 --> 13:48.840]  have police with weapons we rule I mean just totally absolutely 110%
[13:48.840 --> 13:54.400]  criminal out in the open but I'm sorry I'm digressing here so there's all these
[13:54.400 --> 14:00.560]  reports about Hillary saying don't dump our debt we pledge our taxpayers well
[14:00.560 --> 14:04.840]  we're already pledged to pay this what do you think the 28 trillion wise from
[14:04.840 --> 14:09.240]  the banker takeover labeled as a banker bailout I mean that's you paying
[14:09.240 --> 14:14.000]  Iceland said no Greece is trying to say no we don't say no here because we drink
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.440]  fluoride in your brain damage literally we've all been chemically hit and
[14:17.440 --> 14:22.680]  chemically hit hard some people were genius level so you're just average
[14:22.680 --> 14:28.800]  intelligence now despite the poisoning can still think but I mean I'm not
[14:28.800 --> 14:33.160]  kidding this is why you're the most aggressive angry mean intelligent tough
[14:33.160 --> 14:37.960]  innovative rugged individual people in the world all our ancestors that came
[14:37.960 --> 14:42.840]  here whether you're black white Hispanic Asian came here through adversity the
[14:42.840 --> 14:46.800]  toughest of the tough in some cases half the Chinese that came here to build the
[14:46.800 --> 14:51.840]  railroads died only the toughest were left most people that came here were
[14:51.840 --> 14:56.200]  indentured servants even if you were white on average half the people would
[14:56.200 --> 14:59.560]  die in the Atlantic crossing and the coffin ships from Africa only the
[14:59.560 --> 15:04.680]  toughest blacks lived I mean how do we the toughest of the tough you have a
[15:04.680 --> 15:09.640]  similar paradigm in Australia but even more so here in the United States the
[15:09.640 --> 15:14.240]  toughest of the tough frontier wars disease everything else the toughest
[15:14.240 --> 15:19.200]  people in the world now the dumbest fattest stupidest because you've been
[15:19.200 --> 15:23.520]  chemically hit and chemically hit hard that's why they put it in the stinking
[15:23.520 --> 15:29.400]  water why the Soviets and the Nazis did it all the rebels left Europe because
[15:29.400 --> 15:34.400]  they didn't want to be slaves and came here now all we know how to do is suck
[15:34.400 --> 15:39.440]  our thumbs because you've been chemically I'm sorry it's just so
[15:39.440 --> 15:48.720]  insane of course the country is pledged of course the nation is pledged of
[15:48.720 --> 15:56.200]  course it is Reid Bill Clinton's executive order what is it 12,986 I'm
[15:56.200 --> 16:00.800]  going for memory on that it's in America destroy by design
[16:00.800 --> 16:10.480]  you notice the only countries that are immune from this imminent domain or
[16:10.480 --> 16:15.960]  places like Canada and Australia oh and they still take people's property they
[16:15.960 --> 16:20.560]  just announced all the farmers in the country can't clear new land or use their
[16:20.560 --> 16:27.160]  existing land and that was the actual headline because the Queen owns it but
[16:27.160 --> 16:34.000]  you're not gonna see the Chinese or the Arabs coming into Australia or coming
[16:34.000 --> 16:40.360]  into New Zealand or coming into Canada and taking Jack squat because Queenie
[16:40.360 --> 16:47.120]  owns that and twice in the last two years when the parliament in Canada says
[16:47.120 --> 16:50.520]  they're not going to go along with what the puppet prime minister wants
[16:50.520 --> 16:58.240]  instantly the Queen's governor general operates and plays his veto card so we
[16:58.240 --> 17:04.080]  see these articles impeachment time Obama grants imminent domain rights to
[17:04.080 --> 17:10.200]  China to secure debt and then everybody's been running out like a chicken with
[17:10.200 --> 17:13.560]  their head cut off saying is this true or isn't it I need Kurt Nemo or Steve
[17:13.560 --> 17:17.080]  Watson or Paul Watson to listen to the points I just covered go back pull up
[17:17.080 --> 17:21.480]  the articles that back it up and write an article going yes it's true we're not
[17:21.480 --> 17:26.640]  just pledged to China but the Goldman Sachs again most corporations the top
[17:26.640 --> 17:31.280]  100 Fortune 500 the top 100 of those guys are bigger than most countries have
[17:31.280 --> 17:38.320]  more wealth more power again what is it 52 now of the world's biggest economies
[17:38.320 --> 17:43.200]  or corporations are not even countries Walmarts bigger than most countries
[17:43.200 --> 17:54.920]  financially Apple IBM even crippled General Motors and then you got the
[17:54.920 --> 17:59.040]  banks that sit on top of that they got thousands of times all the wealth in
[17:59.040 --> 18:02.320]  all the world it's all made up but we let these crooks stand up and say we're
[18:02.320 --> 18:06.080]  God we own everything we decide who gets currency and credit we go oh
[18:06.080 --> 18:10.440]  absolutely we worship you we'll do whatever you say thank you for destroying
[18:10.440 --> 18:13.560]  our industrial base well that's what we plan to do it's for the environment
[18:13.560 --> 18:20.080]  they're even out in the open saying they want to destroy your rights and a lot
[18:20.080 --> 18:26.520]  of this started back in February with an article be prepared to learn Chinese
[18:26.520 --> 18:29.920]  from the Patriot Room because it looks like our wonderful new administration
[18:29.920 --> 18:34.360]  is granting the Chinese eminent domain as collateral for US debt yeah you read
[18:34.360 --> 18:40.520]  that right this means we can no longer pay for all the massive spending the
[18:40.520 --> 18:46.480]  Chinese can call in the loans and take our land and they're saying this comes
[18:46.480 --> 18:50.080]  from live leak as the story and appears to have confirmation from both

[18:53.520 --> 18:57.160]  State Hillary Clinton was formalized and agreed to during a recent trip to

[22:14.120 --> 22:18.800]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[22:18.800 --> 22:24.080]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay

[24:06.560 --> 24:12.480]  got into the news and I got into just one of the particles dealing with the
[24:12.480 --> 24:17.200]  Chinese being promised our infrastructure our national parks and land our
[24:17.200 --> 24:21.760]  land is already under UN holding through the federal government and UNESCO
[24:21.760 --> 24:29.400]  that's what George Bush did he completed what Clinton started in 2007 when he
[24:29.400 --> 24:39.360]  sent his wife with a signed copy of the UNESCO Treaty didn't matter of the
[24:39.360 --> 24:44.320]  Congress didn't ratify it didn't matter of the Senate didn't ratify it he just
[24:44.320 --> 24:52.280]  ordered the bureaucracy the EPA the National Park System and others the BLM
[24:52.280 --> 25:03.680]  to do it and coming up I'm gonna get into the Washington Post on a similar issue
[25:03.680 --> 25:09.760]  of lawlessness again on every subject the government is lawless it breaks the law
[25:09.760 --> 25:16.000]  it breaks the Constitution it knows it's illegal and it doesn't care why is the
[25:16.000 --> 25:19.880]  Pentagon want to shut down wiki leaks and calling it an enemy because they've
[25:19.880 --> 25:26.640]  been leaking good people in the military have been leaking illegal activity like
[25:26.640 --> 25:33.400]  the Pentagon spying on the American people in non-terror related cases that
[25:33.400 --> 25:38.720]  is illegal and now the Pentagon Inspector General last week said yes it's
[25:38.720 --> 25:43.400]  illegal we're gonna stop doing it yeah and bears are gonna stop doing you know
[25:43.400 --> 25:49.800]  what in the woods I mean this is just the height of lying but here it is the
[25:49.800 --> 25:54.920]  Washington Post house may try to pass Senate health care bill without voting
[25:54.920 --> 26:04.520]  on it you heard that right Pelosi two weeks ago said they may do something
[26:04.520 --> 26:09.160]  better before done spending bills have to originate in the house and so they
[26:09.160 --> 26:12.680]  can send that to the Senate but then if changes are made the house has to vote
[26:12.680 --> 26:19.960]  again because it has to originate in the house that's federal law it's a
[26:19.960 --> 26:27.960]  felony you cannot do this they don't care they say they're gonna do it that is
[26:27.960 --> 26:30.760]  coming up let me start getting into it now we'll come back and go calls the
[26:30.760 --> 26:35.880]  next segment the Washington Post house may try to pass Senate health care bill
[26:35.880 --> 26:39.160]  without voting on it oh that's a new thing where you don't vote okay don't
[26:39.160 --> 26:45.360]  have the votes well we don't need no stinking votes we're your badges we don't
[26:45.360 --> 26:52.720]  need no stinking badges after laying the groundwork for a decisive vote this
[26:52.720 --> 26:58.760]  week on the Senate health care bill house speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested
[26:58.760 --> 27:04.480]  Monday that she might attempt to pass the measure without having members vote
[27:04.480 --> 27:10.640]  on instead Pelosi would rely on procedural sleight of hand oh then
[27:10.640 --> 27:13.960]  we've mentioned this is illegal here just a sleight of hand it's a government
[27:13.960 --> 27:21.280]  sleight of hand it's fine sleight of hand is a good thing instead Pelosi would
[27:21.280 --> 27:26.440]  rely on procedural sleight of hand hmm the house would vote on a more popular
[27:26.440 --> 27:31.600]  package of fixes to the Senate bill under the house rule for that vote passage
[27:31.600 --> 27:38.480]  would signify the lawmakers deem the health care bill to be passed hmm the
[27:38.480 --> 27:47.720]  tactic known as the self-excluding or executing rule or a deem and pass has
[27:47.720 --> 27:51.360]  been commonly used although never to pass legislation is monumental as the
[27:51.360 --> 27:55.080]  875 billion health care so that's another sleight of hand by the Washington
[27:55.080 --> 28:00.960]  Post you can do that on non-spending bills resolutions like this month is
[28:00.960 --> 28:08.400]  stop teen violence month or this month is corn month but if it's got money
[28:08.400 --> 28:13.440]  attached now it's got to start in the house fully in the house not selectively
[28:13.440 --> 28:19.000]  vote on some provisions of a Senate bill it is one of three options that
[28:19.000 --> 28:24.120]  Pelosi said she's considering for a late week house vote but she added that she
[28:24.120 --> 28:28.520]  prefers it because it would politically protect lawmakers who are elected to
[28:28.520 --> 28:31.760]  publicly support the measure that's right see they won't have to vote for it
[28:31.760 --> 28:36.200]  so they can then go lie to their constituents say I didn't vote for it
[28:36.200 --> 28:44.320]  it's just law now separately I've got a Washington Post article about Dennis
[28:44.320 --> 28:48.360]  Kosinich targeted by White House Dennis Kosinich on the hot seat there's a
[28:48.360 --> 28:52.680]  bunch of articles about it today and he was in this multi-hour plane flight
[28:52.680 --> 28:57.360]  privately meeting with Barack Obama on Air Force One and he got off the plane
[28:57.360 --> 29:01.960]  smiling but wouldn't talk about what happened Dennis Kosinich isn't perfect
[29:01.960 --> 29:07.000]  I don't like him on gun control a lot of issues but at least he has always done
[29:07.000 --> 29:11.080]  what he says he'll do and he for several months has said this is a bailout to
[29:11.080 --> 29:15.760]  insurance companies a ripoff it cuts Medicare and Medicaid there's liability
[29:15.760 --> 29:19.800]  protection to the insurance companies they wrote the bill it's a ripoff Howard
[29:19.800 --> 29:26.840]  Dean had said that he's now flip-flopped and Kosinich you need to call
[29:26.840 --> 29:31.480]  Kosinich's office everybody needs to call it and say look Dennis you have
[29:31.480 --> 29:37.520]  never flip-flopped don't sell out for whatever Obama is promising you or
[29:37.520 --> 29:44.080]  whatever threats he's making don't do it don't do it Dennis Kosinich because if
[29:44.080 --> 29:47.280]  they get his vote it's really bad they may even try to pass it with a vote in
[29:47.280 --> 29:55.320]  house we'll be right back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones

[33:27.120 --> 33:33.680]  cold weather all weather is unnatural there is never changes on the earth and
[33:33.680 --> 33:37.200]  basically the planet's got to stay at 76 degrees I mean that's what they're
[33:37.200 --> 33:41.200]  saying that sounds ridiculous but in effect they're saying we've now got to
[33:41.200 --> 33:45.600]  stabilize our climate climate change it's not global warming it's climate
[33:45.600 --> 33:54.000]  change and he says flooding in the east and snow is global warming meanwhile
[33:54.000 --> 33:58.720]  there's a new study out here is the London Guardian there's a more detailed
[33:58.720 --> 34:06.320]  report and actually quotes the study of the London Telegraph how going green may
[34:06.320 --> 34:13.080]  make you mean ethical consumers less likely to be kind and more likely to
[34:13.080 --> 34:18.600]  steal six times more likely to steal this is a scientific study conducted in
[34:18.600 --> 34:23.480]  Canada and the people that commissioned it thought it would find that
[34:23.480 --> 34:28.800]  environmentalists were more moral no you have conservationist people that are
[34:28.800 --> 34:32.360]  really concerned but on average they are control freaks that want your house
[34:32.360 --> 34:37.160]  want your car want your life I mean here in Austin you park an SUV down at
[34:37.160 --> 34:41.000]  Zilker there is glass all over the ground everywhere they will stab your
[34:41.000 --> 34:46.280]  tires they will smash your windows they love it when you come up to the cash
[34:46.280 --> 34:51.240]  register to buy groceries you say I want plastic because the paper breaks studies
[34:51.240 --> 34:54.800]  actually show that the paper is more destructive with the acid in the trees
[34:54.800 --> 34:59.120]  the acid production of the bags and then the cutting down the trees but they
[34:59.120 --> 35:03.440]  don't care somehow they've got in their mind that plastic is worse and so they
[35:03.440 --> 35:07.360]  religiously look down on you and they find that basically they're greedy
[35:07.360 --> 35:10.640]  control freaks well of course they are they hate everyone they're normally
[35:10.640 --> 35:15.200]  slovenly lazy scum and then of course the big banks that run it they just want
[35:15.200 --> 35:25.000]  to take everybody's property but it's a criminal group so we're gonna be going
[35:25.000 --> 35:33.040]  over that later in the broadcast today I've already got my stacks all mixed up

[35:50.520 --> 35:55.920]  14 degrees yesterday that's Celsius well thank god Al Gore saved the planet just
[35:55.920 --> 36:00.440]  paying some more tax money and a ill mill mill make it okay he's just full of
[36:00.440 --> 36:04.720]  hot air maybe if you'd stop talking you know it would save the environment or
[36:04.720 --> 36:09.920]  maybe if he didn't have more than 10 houses one of them 24,000 square feet
[36:09.920 --> 36:15.400]  absolutely Al Gore's an idiot so is Bill Gates saying he wants to reduce carbon
[36:15.400 --> 36:21.840]  dioxide to 0% and he says humans are the main function and we must reduce our
[36:21.840 --> 36:26.120]  numbers oh it's very evil but don't worry I'll let you I mean let him run the
[36:26.120 --> 36:29.520]  environmental tyranny and pay him billions to run it and he will save you
[36:29.520 --> 36:36.000]  he will make he will wave a magic wand Adam he loves you oh he does he loves me
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.760]  so much I want to kick him in the crotch probably doesn't have anything
[36:40.760 --> 36:46.440]  between his legs so that wouldn't do anything probably an android but I want
[36:46.440 --> 36:51.760]  to talk about Canada and how how it doesn't have any freedoms for anybody
[36:51.760 --> 36:56.920]  in its country well they are incrementally taking your guns they are
[36:56.920 --> 37:00.920]  grabbing your property and they are banning a lot of free speech up there
[37:00.920 --> 37:05.840]  but that's freedom well actually I read the Charter of Rights for Canada and
[37:05.840 --> 37:11.000]  there's no freedom for any individual within Canada that's only groups and
[37:11.000 --> 37:17.760]  such groups as the government decides to be their lapdog yes but I was going
[37:17.760 --> 37:22.960]  to work one day last year in the morning early in the morning and I was
[37:22.960 --> 37:29.120]  doing construction so I had a work knife with me and some peace officers came
[37:29.120 --> 37:35.840]  in the side of my pocket and they tried to rough me up well you may be al-Qaeda
[37:35.840 --> 37:42.200]  oh yes look you can't have a prisoner you can't have a prisoner out walking
[37:42.200 --> 37:46.200]  around free on the streets we're prisoners we've got to be searched we've
[37:46.200 --> 37:49.520]  got to be arrested we've got to be disarmed Adam I appreciate your call
[37:49.520 --> 37:54.800]  let's take talk to another Adam here Adam in Missouri you're on the air yes
[37:54.800 --> 37:59.920]  hi thanks for taking my call just a couple quick questions one what is your
[37:59.920 --> 38:07.320]  take on propylene glycol and then other another question was if people are if
[38:07.320 --> 38:12.240]  they're one to destroy 80 to 90 percent of the world's population why haven't
[38:12.240 --> 38:17.000]  they done so already okay we'll go back with your statement about propylene
[38:17.000 --> 38:22.800]  glycol yeah that's a chemical that in those e-cigarettes and and most of the
[38:22.800 --> 38:26.840]  e-cigarettes are manufactured in China so when you were doing that blurp on
[38:26.840 --> 38:31.240]  fluoride and people purchasing the fluoride from China what other
[38:31.240 --> 38:37.720]  chemicals that obviously their their self safety regulations aren't aren't the
[38:37.720 --> 38:42.400]  same standards as ours or they're not keeping it under control so I just didn't
[38:42.400 --> 38:46.120]  I don't know you guys advertise the e-cigarette online or on the show and
[38:46.120 --> 38:50.440]  stuff so I didn't know what your take on it was alright I appreciate your call I
[38:50.440 --> 38:54.080]  think we have had a banner at I don't think we have one anymore but I do think
[38:54.080 --> 38:57.080]  these cigarettes are better than smoking regular cigarettes with all the
[38:57.080 --> 39:06.320]  chemicals and toxins in the smoke but when you talk about propylene glycol I
[39:06.320 --> 39:12.440]  off the top my head don't have a print out on it so guys you print that for me
[39:12.440 --> 39:16.720]  so I can look it up I think I know what it is and I think I can make a comment
[39:16.720 --> 39:21.160]  but I want to make sure I'm being accurate what was the other subject oh the
[39:21.160 --> 39:27.520]  other subject was the population the population of the earth if the globalist
[39:27.520 --> 39:30.520]  hadn't put in place some of their policies would probably be about 11
[39:30.520 --> 39:34.760]  billion right now according to some of the statistics I've seen where it said
[39:34.760 --> 39:42.800]  is about six and a half billion people on the earth and the globalist have been
[39:42.800 --> 39:49.560]  incrementally beta testing their soft kill vaccines food additives GMO HIV is
[39:49.560 --> 39:53.760]  clearly manufactured and we've had guests on and on over those documents here
[39:53.760 --> 39:58.200]  but a lot of times I get this from mainstream media they say well they
[39:58.200 --> 40:02.040]  want to kill everybody they're not doing a very good job I mean you know we were
[40:02.040 --> 40:08.040]  five billion people 15 20 years ago and now we're six plus billion if you look
[40:08.040 --> 40:11.640]  at all the statistics we're supposed to plane out at about eight and a half
[40:11.640 --> 40:18.240]  billion in 2020 2025 depending on the statistics you look at and then start
[40:18.240 --> 40:22.600]  going down because every industrial society once you industrialize whether
[40:22.600 --> 40:29.880]  it's Italy Japan Germany England Russia the United States the international
[40:29.880 --> 40:37.280]  average is 1.3 children some countries are 1.2 some are 1.5 but it averages out
[40:37.280 --> 40:42.880]  at 1.3 1.4 depending on the year so for every two parents who had a mommy and
[40:42.880 --> 40:49.960]  daddy they only have 1.2 1.3 1.4 children so it's not a replacement rate
[40:49.960 --> 40:54.920]  and we've aborted 50 million babies in the last 36 years here in the United
[40:54.920 --> 40:59.080]  States and notice we've brought in 50 million legal and illegal it's just
[40:59.080 --> 41:02.880]  about 50 million legal and illegal immigrants it's about 3 million legal a
[41:02.880 --> 41:08.040]  year that's about a million and a half legal a year 3 million illegal a year so
[41:08.040 --> 41:14.120]  if you go over all of that you can see it the issue is it isn't my opinion that
[41:14.120 --> 41:19.240]  they say they want to reduce world population that's in the State Department
[41:19.240 --> 41:23.000]  memorandum 200 that's in the United Nations biological diversity assessment
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.520]  1996 you've seen Ted Turner Prince Phillips say it you saw the Copenhagen
[41:27.520 --> 41:34.920]  Denmark summit AP headline UN wants global one-child policy you've seen all
[41:34.920 --> 41:38.600]  the headlines about we only need to have one or two children to save the
[41:38.600 --> 41:42.640]  environment you know don't have children to cut carbon footprint I mean it's
[41:42.640 --> 41:48.920]  literally thousands of news articles we have clips of it in in game blueprint
[41:48.920 --> 41:52.280]  for global enslavement with the news saying you know don't have more than
[41:52.280 --> 41:59.680]  one or two children to save the earth we know that the polio vaccine given to
[41:59.680 --> 42:04.200]  hundreds of millions of Americans had live SV 40 and the government admits it
[42:04.200 --> 42:11.080]  killed a bunch of people cause cancer so they've been beta testing all of this the
[42:11.080 --> 42:17.320]  UN's been caught adding hormones in Africa and in India and other regions the
[42:17.320 --> 42:20.880]  subcontinent and the African continent they've been caught in forced
[42:20.880 --> 42:25.480]  sterilization programs tied to IMF World Bank money in Peru I mean just
[42:25.480 --> 42:30.400]  everywhere so when people say well then why don't we see this reduction you
[42:30.400 --> 42:36.840]  have seen a reduction we would be over 10 billion people conservatively some
[42:36.840 --> 42:42.120]  estimates are 11 some 12 we'd be over 10 billion right now but it's six and a
[42:42.120 --> 42:46.560]  half billion that's like a four billion or more reduction in people that were
[42:46.560 --> 42:52.360]  never born when they banned DDT and hyped up all these dangers that really
[42:52.360 --> 42:57.760]  weren't there compared to other pesticides they're using it's like
[42:57.760 --> 42:59.880]  they're saying the bald eagle's all dead it's not it's not it you know they're
[42:59.880 --> 43:03.720]  saying the polar bears are all dead their numbers are way up it did hurt some
[43:03.720 --> 43:07.640]  pelicans and things because what you have DDT getting sprayed all over the
[43:07.640 --> 43:11.120]  country then it precipitates out in the rivers and streams comes out of the
[43:11.120 --> 43:17.000]  ocean very concentrated in certain species of fish that are you know larger
[43:17.000 --> 43:21.600]  say a pound to two pounds that's what those pelicans white and brown
[43:21.600 --> 43:27.120]  pelicans are eating and and so yeah it was killing them
[43:30.920 --> 43:40.560]  now they have given me some articles here the e-cigarette controversy there's
[43:40.560 --> 43:42.920]  an article about that so somebody wants to look into that you go pull up
[43:42.920 --> 43:48.400]  articles about it but there's no doubt they're putting fluoride other chemicals
[43:48.400 --> 43:51.480]  in our water there's no doubt they're putting mercury in our food there's no
[43:51.480 --> 43:58.120]  doubt any of this is going on there's no doubt that fertility has dropped by
[43:58.120 --> 44:02.680]  more than 85% in men's sperm and that female fertility is way down in every
[44:02.680 --> 44:08.360]  western country I mean this is all on record so there there's your answer
[44:08.360 --> 44:13.640]  Adam has seen in Jersey you're on the air go ahead
[44:13.640 --> 44:19.640]  Alex Jones how are you sir I'm doing okay welcome listen I am majorly
[44:19.640 --> 44:24.240]  concerned about the whole water crisis that's taking place and for years my
[44:24.240 --> 44:28.280]  family has been drinking distilled water so I'm just wondering is that safe and
[44:28.280 --> 44:34.400]  if not what is a a good way that we could prevent all these diseases in the
[44:34.400 --> 44:37.760]  water by drinking some type of safe bottle water or some purification system
[44:37.760 --> 44:43.400]  that's affordable okay this is something I have studied in depth so I can
[44:43.400 --> 44:50.400]  comment on it you do not want to drink only distilled water because it I mean
[44:50.400 --> 45:00.880]  they give distilled water to people to detoxify it it strips out and I'm not a
[45:01.040 --> 45:06.320]  I'm not a chemist on this I've just read with the chemist and people that study
[45:06.320 --> 45:10.320]  the human body have have reported I know that when somebody has say lead
[45:10.320 --> 45:14.720]  poisoning or mercury poisoning they tell them okay for a few months drink
[45:14.720 --> 45:20.760]  distilled water because it will literally there's nothing already bound to the
[45:20.760 --> 45:24.720]  water molecules and I'm simplifying this okay I'll have a bunch of chemists right
[45:24.720 --> 45:29.560]  mean big emails explain the exact mechanics it's like when I say fluoride
[45:29.560 --> 45:32.960]  one of the smallest particles and people say well it's not these smallest but it
[45:32.960 --> 45:37.880]  is the most reactive it's tiny it goes through most filtration systems is my
[45:37.880 --> 45:42.920]  point okay so these are generalities here you can go look it up yourself I
[45:42.920 --> 45:49.200]  like to be very precise here but from the medical doctors I've talked to distilled
[45:49.200 --> 45:54.160]  water is very good to detox you for a few months but you need the minerals that
[45:54.160 --> 46:03.040]  are in regular water you need the trace elements and there's nothing in distilled
[46:03.040 --> 46:12.400]  water so what I do is I have a mix I have a reverse osmosis I have a a cola
[46:12.400 --> 46:17.680]  blue so we kind of cook with reverse osmosis we drink a cola blue but I
[46:17.680 --> 46:25.040]  also have several brands been drinking it for years and suddenly I can't remember
[46:25.040 --> 46:29.840]  the name of it what's the what's the green bottle water I drink
[46:31.720 --> 46:36.080]  that mountain Valley spring yeah mountain Valley spring it really good as
[46:36.080 --> 46:41.440]  great minerals in it I feel good when I drink it it's not placebo but if you I've
[46:41.440 --> 46:50.360]  put a glass of it a bottle of it in a glass and then let it let it evaporate
[46:50.360 --> 46:54.160]  and you can see down at the bottom the minerals that are on it and that's one
[46:54.160 --> 46:59.520]  of the most celebrated bottle waters out there but I tend to just mix it up
[46:59.520 --> 47:05.760]  mix it up is the key I drink Ozarka I like that problem is the plastic bottles
[47:05.760 --> 47:14.440]  leech estrogen mimicking compounds into it but no sir you do not want to drink
[47:14.440 --> 47:17.400]  only distilled water I'm not saying it's gonna be devastating because your kids
[47:17.400 --> 47:20.520]  are gonna drink juice and other things that have water that was added to it that
[47:20.520 --> 47:29.480]  had some minerals but I wouldn't again this is what I do I basically mix it up
[47:29.480 --> 47:34.040]  but a lot of people drink during a detox period that they will drink nothing
[47:34.040 --> 47:39.720]  but distilled water for a month and you don't want to go longer than that okay
[47:39.720 --> 47:44.640]  because it is a powerful purifier and it will purify so much it'll strip all the
[47:44.640 --> 47:48.760]  good stuff out and actually strip stuff out of your bones and your blood I'm
[47:48.760 --> 47:53.360]  getting a lot of questions today let's go ahead and talk to Julio in Illinois
[47:53.360 --> 47:58.840]  you're on the air hey Alex Jones how are you this afternoon sir good welcome
[47:58.840 --> 48:03.800]  thank you quick quick comment and then my question first my comment I send you
[48:03.800 --> 48:09.240]  an email last Sunday show tip that info wars dot com in regard to Lindsey
[48:09.240 --> 48:15.040]  Williams I did research about the health care bill and RFID chip talking about
[48:15.040 --> 48:19.280]  telehealth systems and how telehealth it was a video from the University of
[48:19.280 --> 48:25.280]  California at Davis it's on YouTube talking about how RFID is a major
[48:25.280 --> 48:30.560]  component of the telehealth system telehealth is listed in the bill numerous
[48:30.560 --> 48:34.520]  times let me just let me just because not everybody's on the same page as us
[48:34.520 --> 48:38.480]  they're wondering what you're talking about right now Julio Lindsey Williams
[48:38.480 --> 48:42.400]  mentioned how the health care bill has an implantable microchip and people
[48:42.400 --> 48:45.720]  didn't it's in the bill I don't know how this got attached to Lindsey Williams I
[48:45.720 --> 48:51.120]  mean he's telling the truth and they do have sections in the bill in both versions
[48:51.120 --> 48:55.920]  I've seen the current House and Senate version for the feds to fund these RFID
[48:55.920 --> 48:59.960]  systems to go in basically where they want to implant a chip in you and the
[48:59.960 --> 49:04.560]  government says they'll pay for that when you go in for medical care and so yes
[49:04.560 --> 49:09.800]  it's real and it's going on they talk about telehealth that's the big thing
[49:09.800 --> 49:14.600]  AT&T they have a video they're supposed to make huge profits one's president
[49:14.600 --> 49:20.280]  for Toro's uh... all fascist health care overhaul bill passes my other question
[49:20.280 --> 49:24.080]  is I got in the mail yesterday so did my other freedom fighting friends from the
[49:24.080 --> 49:29.480]  US census and on the front it says it is required by law to fill this out I
[49:29.480 --> 49:33.680]  wanted to get your time and then it'll show inside the US code and what they
[49:33.680 --> 49:37.520]  do is they'll have the legal questions how many people live here what's your
[49:37.520 --> 49:41.680]  name stuff like that the first few and then under that will have the US code
[49:41.680 --> 49:45.200]  and then they'll have all the other questions under it at least in 2000 when
[49:45.200 --> 49:50.720]  I got it it's just all color of law fraud I don't fill it out I haven't gotten
[49:50.720 --> 49:57.160]  mine yet and I'll fill out who lives there and that's it and they come to my
[49:57.160 --> 50:01.240]  door and threaten me like in 2000 I see get off my front porch punk and that's
[50:01.240 --> 50:02.760]  the end of it
[50:02.760 --> 50:06.680]  and my final question do you think like they did with the world war two
[50:06.680 --> 50:11.040]  Japanese internment camps most of those Japanese were American citizens do you
[50:11.040 --> 50:15.560]  think with the census along with this RFID that they may use this with those
[50:15.560 --> 50:19.440]  GPS trackers you're talking about they admit it and what you just said is
[50:19.440 --> 50:24.760]  true anybody can affect Google it census data used her to a rat to round up
[50:24.760 --> 50:29.320]  Japanese citizens and they also used some of the Italians and Germans and they
[50:29.320 --> 50:34.280]  but don't worry I was watching some old World War two newsreels it was a
[50:34.280 --> 50:41.320]  emergency evacuation they only evacuated the Japanese to the camps just like the
[50:41.320 --> 50:47.240]  emergency centers act in the house just says to evacuate citizens to FEMA camps
[50:47.240 --> 50:51.720]  for our safety I mean come on we need to know your GPS coordinates and your name
[50:51.720 --> 50:55.920]  and tracking your car with a license plate scanners and your cell phone so we
[50:55.920 --> 50:59.880]  can evacuate you to the labor camp come on

[51:13.920 --> 51:18.280]  about the wild food experience it's inspiring for many who are affected by
[51:18.280 --> 51:21.920]  the recent downturn of the economy I already knew a bit about foraging and
[51:21.920 --> 51:25.840]  edibles you take it to a whole new level a thousand thanks to you for all that
[51:25.840 --> 51:29.840]  great knowledge it was empowering when I was in the Navy I went through a couple
[51:29.840 --> 51:34.040]  of quick land survival classes thank you for being an inspiration and for all the
[51:34.040 --> 51:37.560]  work that you do I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information

[52:04.080 --> 52:09.080]  last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're
[52:09.080 --> 52:12.880]  finishing off this agenda they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the
[52:12.880 --> 52:17.760]  Americans at home turning men's influence on our president in Congress and
[52:17.760 --> 52:22.600]  they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as
[52:22.600 --> 52:27.640]  American citizens to pay attention full of the Republic identifies the enemies
[52:27.640 --> 52:32.680]  of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[52:32.680 --> 52:36.840]  and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their
[52:36.840 --> 52:40.640]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who
[52:40.640 --> 52:44.480]  do we make the check out to today seems like nobody does care and right now in

[56:13.080 --> 56:16.960]  get started here I just want to say I pledge and that is I pledge allegiance to
[56:16.960 --> 56:24.640]  the flag and with you about 10 years membership for about a year I'm sure
[56:24.640 --> 56:27.960]  you guys will email me tell me when my membership sucks so I can continue my
[56:27.960 --> 56:35.320]  fight with you guys thank you couple things I'm really getting kind of
[56:35.320 --> 56:43.520]  frustrated with you know doctors that are saying you gotta understand I come
[56:43.520 --> 56:50.600]  from family that has had my father's a chemical operator or just retired from
[56:50.600 --> 56:57.160]  the county water out here and I know what goes into water he knows what goes
[56:57.160 --> 57:04.840]  into water he won't drink the water and it's for everybody I'm tired of the the
[57:04.840 --> 57:11.280]  the medical community saying that there's vitamins in the water there are no
[57:11.280 --> 57:19.680]  vitamins in the water how I'm looking at a hundred pound bucket of dry tack HTH
[57:19.680 --> 57:28.720]  and this is from the company of HTH and it's a granular calcium hypochlorate and
[57:28.720 --> 57:40.280]  the key on this thing is in the wonderful danger area it says if inhaled
[57:40.280 --> 57:48.040]  we read it on air it says it's deadly poison and attacks all the organs and
[57:48.040 --> 57:53.080]  that it's about as deadly as it gets but let me expand on that here with you Jim
[57:53.080 --> 57:58.240]  I looked last night at the YouTube channel with tens of thousands of views
[57:58.240 --> 58:04.760]  of my Sunday show radio TV show and I saw spammers over every one of the six
[58:04.760 --> 58:09.960]  parts of the video saying show us your proof liar Alex keeps saying he's got
[58:09.960 --> 58:14.360]  the documents show us the proof that all these government studies show that
[58:14.360 --> 58:18.960]  fluoride causes cancer and is deadly and on the show I was holding up Curt
[58:18.960 --> 58:22.880]  Nemo's article that had all the hyperlinks to the FDA and government
[58:22.880 --> 58:26.680]  studies and I was saying go here and read the studies and then they still come
[58:26.680 --> 58:32.680]  in there and say I'm a liar I mean I mean it's just amazing and yes I have
[58:32.680 --> 58:38.400]  family in each Texas one of them's the head engineer at the water plant will

[59:46.760 --> 01:00:00.760]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:12.320]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:19.840]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:28.160]  Alex Jones we're now into our number two we just now join this big news blitz
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:32.360]  I mean the news blitz coming up starting at the 20 after I want to take
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:36.720]  calls right now Jim and St. Louis was talking about one of his family members
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:39.880]  that just retired from the water department and how he won't drink the
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:50.240]  water my my uncle's wife her brother is like one of the head guys or the head guy
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:54.040]  at the water treatment facility and he said you know this stuff's really bad
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:57.880]  for you we know it the water that comes out of our aquifer is absolutely
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:03.480]  crystal clean and delicious and we're mandated with federal funding to add
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:06.760]  this to the water and of course no one that I know that works at water treatment
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.840]  plants when we got a tour of the Austin water plant they wouldn't let us video
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:14.600]  tape but off record they were like we know we know we know it's bad yes we
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:20.320]  don't like it go to the city council and change it I mean they're there they
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:24.320]  have to wear respirators they were gloves and full plastic body gear and
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:28.600]  they're scared to death when they're adding it I mean this stuff is so deadly
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:34.760]  you breathe one whiff of it it can kill you and they know okay they know and
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.880]  then there's the argument well we only put one to three parts per million in
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:43.520]  the average city you know that's not that big a level but fluoride is one of
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:47.560]  the most cumulative poisons there is almost all of it stays in the body
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:52.640]  it's one of the most reactive molecules out there and that's only part of what
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.240]  they're putting in but we really couldn't hear you Jim when you were
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:59.280]  getting away from the phone trying to read the container of fluoride but
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:04.800]  finish up your point well anyway it says if swallowed drink large quantities of
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:10.720]  water do not induce vomiting and call a physician you know this is my point is
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:17.800]  no matter how much for one there's no vitamins in water they put lime in the
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:24.320]  water they put HTH in the water and they do the fluorinating and the
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:30.360]  fluorinating is a basically a really in the summer times well don't forget the
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:36.480]  chlorine don't forget the chlorine well the HTH is chlorine yeah correct I mean
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:39.640]  if you're not gonna drink chlorine I mean what's the point well look look look
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:47.520]  look here's an example I've talked repeatedly to not just the at neighborhood
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:51.520]  pools community pools I have not just talked to the guy they have cleaned the
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:56.760]  pool I've talked to the pool company owners and to people that run the
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:01.600]  companies and they say that when they fill a pool up they don't even need to
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:08.320]  fluoridate it for a week or two or not Florida to put the chlorine in it
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:12.640]  because it it has massive amounts already it takes a while for it to
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:18.200]  dissipate and here's the other issue if you say fill up your fish tank with
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:24.720]  regular water and put a goldfish in it it's going to die okay fish won't live
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:29.360]  in it but you're supposed to drink it now I mean again ladies and gentlemen if
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:38.240]  it's killing animals then how are you supposed it's a cocktail you know here's
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:43.720]  an example my wife's parents great folks we ate over there Sunday lunch they
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:47.640]  don't think the government would hurt them so they like drinking tap water and
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:50.640]  my wife made the comment that she couldn't drink the water because it tasted
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:56.800]  like like kerosene and growing up in Dallas I didn't know floor I was bad I
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:00.640]  didn't chlorine was bad I just knew that when I drank water it tasted horrible and
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:06.360]  gave me a headache and I mean Dallas water stinks Houston water but I'm
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:11.240]  ranting here I appreciate your called Jim we're gonna come back and go to
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:17.080]  Cynthia Parker Jeff Goods low and others the toll-free number to join us is 1
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:26.680]  800 259 9231 but I go back to again the spammers all over articles we write
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:31.520]  about fluoride all over YouTube videos we put up and these are people that are
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:35.880]  drinking this poison these are people probably paid to go say we're cooks and
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:41.120]  liars and you're drinking it you're getting bone cancer you're attacking
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:46.080]  your own organs the government admits this this is not a conspiracy theory but
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:50.360]  you don't care you love the psychological association with power you think
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:54.360]  you're part of the government you think you're toadies to and it's just
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:58.280]  completely insane you're killing yourself and you love it we'll be right
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:02.120]  back this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:06.480]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:10.640]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:14.680]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:18.560]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:22.840]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:27.000]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.320]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:35.040]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:39.200]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:34.200]  on the air hi how are you good thank you okay I'm really concerned about this
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:39.320]  health care bill there's gonna push this through in about three days Dick Morris
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:44.920]  has about 30 Democrats that maybe swing boats that you can contact that numbers
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:49.600]  are all Dick Morris calm I'd like to just cover a couple points about this
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:54.240]  health care bill still covers abortion still mandates everyone purchase health
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:58.400]  insurance still leaves people uninsured it still mandates a national ID and
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:02.040]  microchip implant it still covers illegal immigrants it still has end-of-life
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:07.360]  counseling promised it wouldn't cover the illegal immigrants in fact guys I
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:12.120]  forgot about this the last two days Rick Perry the big conservative is doing what
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:16.880]  other states are doing giving illegal aliens in-state tuition so if you're
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:22.040]  from Oklahoma and come to Texas or New York and come to Texas you pay double or
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:26.680]  triple in some cases for tuition at community colleges and state colleges
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:32.440]  and others but the illegal aliens get the same as somebody who's always lived
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:38.040]  in Texas so again yes they promise no illegal aliens covered but of course it
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:42.040]  does cover them it's all part of the lies that come out of government go ahead
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:47.000]  still leads to ration care the two-course of the bill is grossly underestimated it
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.280]  establishes a medical dictatorship and tramples on alternative medicine it does
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:10:00.480]  um which basically limits your selection of any kind of health care any kind of
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:04.720]  doctor any kind of treatment and I just want to read a quote from Tom Daschle
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:10.040]  in his book critical what we can do about the health care crisis the elderly
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:13.880]  have around responsibility to die knowing that they are not going to survive
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:18.120]  their chronic illnesses so that society can save money and pump funds into care
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:23.080]  for the younger more worthy recipients and by the way I read that about a year
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:27.920]  ago on air when Daschle was still there and people didn't believe it he's the
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:32.080]  original author of the health care bill and I actually went on and bought the
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:37.120]  book I saw that in Bloomberg in a Bloomberg financial article and it's
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:40.120]  not that I didn't believe it but I went out and bought the book and waved it
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:43.760]  around on TV I could somewhere here around the office and there's more in
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:48.800]  the book he said of your 60 years old you're not gonna get eye surgery because
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:53.880]  you're supposed to go blind so it's more than just oh it's a chronic thing we
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:57.640]  decide you're gonna die see the death panels are all real that's the bio
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:04.000]  ethicist and all of this is really happening and and and Cynthia it's just
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.320]  it looks like it may not pass but everybody's got a call Congress and
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:11.720]  you're right dick Morris does have a good list of the swing votes there but
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:16.560]  but see Pelosi says they may not even have to vote they may just say that
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:22.360]  well we'll just let the Senate version going over to Obama well then we have
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:27.200]  to repeal it but in the meantime everyone's call these numbers they're
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:31.400]  just sitting there waiting for your call you can get through pretty easily so
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:36.840]  they may be rude to you to AIDS but you know just call and just make sure that
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:41.720]  they write down your comments and I just want to say God bless you Alex well

[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:49.960]  enough God bless you all right I appreciate you God bless you let's talk
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:55.280]  to Parker and Illinois Parker you're on the air hi thanks for taking my call I
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:02.000]  just a quick I have a quick comment and then a question sure I just like to say
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.600]  books are a really good way to wake people up because all those people who
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:09.200]  like if I show them a bunch of movies no matter how much will be like oh no it's
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:13.240]  just undocumented nobody it's all fake you can just make a movie and do whatever
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:16.960]  but like if you show them a book then they have to look at them and be like
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:20.760]  oh well there's actually documentation here either their fools I mean if you
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:26.120]  watch my films they're what I'd call a film book I mean everything we claim we
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:29.840]  show you it out of the elites own mouths we show you blow-ups of their
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:34.640]  documents we have online bibliographies at fall the republic.com the
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:41.640]  Obama deception what is the in-game.com martial law 911.info I mean we have
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:50.160]  online video bibliographies these are books they're visual books yeah there's
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:54.120]  a lot of fools out there that's for sure but all they just use that as a
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:57.960]  rationale and an excuse oh I'm not even gonna watch that you can say whatever
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:02.320]  you want on a video what you do is you go no this is the elite in their own
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:08.800]  words in fact Burma's has taken this to a new level other than G. Edward Griffin
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:15.480]  and a few other people that he interviews on video in the film it is
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:19.560]  almost entirely the elites own words and their own documents very powerful film
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:25.120]  go ahead. I was because when I was younger and stuff I had no clue what was
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:28.440]  going on so my parents pretty much decided what happened to me so I got
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:32.520]  like multiple flu shots over the years I was wondering if there is any possible
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:39.720]  way to like counteract what happened so like it has less effect on me now. There
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:45.960]  is try to eat real organic food exercise drink purified water you could for a
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:49.920]  few months drink distilled water but after that it becomes dangerous because
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:53.360]  it'll actually strip out too many minerals from your body you have to
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:57.920]  take a mineral supplement to replace them but still it'll strip those there's
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:01.200]  some other chelation methods out there but I'd rather have medical doctors on
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:04.000]  to break it down I don't like to give medical advice I'm just telling you
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:11.160]  what I do. Well thanks for having me on. Parker I appreciate you calling Jeff in
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:17.680]  Canada you're on the air. Hi Alex thanks for taking my call. Welcome. Okay a
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:23.040]  couple of things here first of all I wanted to thank you and your staff for
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.800]  the wonderful work you do and all the hard work and commitment you do and it
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:30.040]  is really paying off people around me are waking up everywhere. Yeah it's really
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:33.800]  paying off I got Co and Telpro and the ADL and Southern Prairie Law Center and
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:37.880]  Time Magazine, New York Times, Newsweek everything else coming out against me we
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:41.520]  played a recording yesterday at the Southern Prairie Law Center saying I made
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:45.440]  that guy kill the cops when when when it's had nothing to do with the guy and
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:49.920]  the guy online hated me some Nazi I mean it's folks I need your prayers they are
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:55.160]  I have the New World Order directly singling me out as their biggest enemy
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:59.120]  and I'm just a radio talk show host filmmaker I mean this is really spooky
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:03.400]  go ahead. Alex well what I wanted to say was that people are waking up
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:07.720]  everywhere and and one thing that I know that you've said in the past is that we
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:13.000]  outnumber them so that's I think that that's that's the secret. I first I
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.680]  have I'm just in the beginning stages of setting up a We Are Changed local
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:23.840]  chapter here in Windsor Ontario Canada and there is an expo coming up where
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:27.920]  Bill Clinton is speaking on behalf of the Windsor Essex Region Conservation
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:34.040]  Authority and I just wanted to set up a true squad here in Windsor and I
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:37.480]  almost feel like like I don't have a lot of people that are experienced in this
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:41.560]  way so if there's if there's anybody in the area that wants to help out I would
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:46.040]  sure appreciate the help but I have a question for you my question is if you
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:51.800]  have ever heard of a guy by the name of Robert Arthur Menard and he's he belongs
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:55.880]  to a group called the World Freeman Society and it's basically about the
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:01.800]  free man on the land. Yeah I mean that's kind of the British picking up what
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:05.200]  patriots have been promoting and saying and I think there's a lot of a lot of
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:10.240]  truth to it. I appreciate your call. Let's talk to Good's Low in Ohio. You're on
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:16.240]  the air. Hi Alex. I live in a small town of about 2,500 people in East Central Ohio
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:21.960]  called Yerkesville, Ohio. A few years back we had a guy named Rick Rieger was
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:26.120]  infiltrating our Chamber of Commerce and is now mayor of the town. It turns out
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:29.800]  that he worked for General Swartzcoff and General Tommy Franks, General
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:35.200]  Swartzcoff in the first Gulf War, Tommy Franks in the second and was at the Pentagon on
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:40.640]  9-11 when the plane or alleged plane. Well I don't know who this guy is. I don't
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:44.920]  know your local politics and I like to really be careful about even callers
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:49.360]  saying things that I'm not saying you're a bad guy. It's just the point
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:53.840]  here is my name's Alex Jones. I'm on air. Who I am is clear. You're calling in
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:58.920]  saying things about people but it is true that the feds have think tanks that
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:02.680]  tell cities who to make police chief and that was actually in the Dallas Morning
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:06.760]  News last week and other publications about Arte Sveida being totally federally
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:11.160]  run from Austin now probably going to Dallas and it is true that sheriff's
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:16.120]  police chiefs even small towns they're putting former DEA, former FBI, former
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:21.680]  Pentagon in everywhere as part of their infraguard federal takeover. I know
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:24.760]  locally they have in the paper they admitted oh he's former black op
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:28.360]  commander, a colonel. He's gonna run all the environmental programs and the home
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:33.320]  inspections and you know he's bringing in other Pentagon former people and so
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:36.160]  yes it's very creepy but I don't know specifically about who you're talking
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:39.640]  about. Well yeah it's not even specifically about the person. What
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:45.440]  happened after he became mayor as that the Pentagon or I guess the Pentagon
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:50.800]  had urban warfare drills in your city? One sorry? Had urban warfare drills or
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:55.000]  something? Oh no they actually got an armor personnel carrier for a
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.960]  town of 2,500 people. Well you're the enemy. They're mountain 50 cows on them
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:05.560]  and Florida and Louisiana they're training local citizens to work with
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:09.280]  the government to quote take on other citizens with 50 cows. They're just gonna
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:13.520]  mow citizens down. There's 50 cows mounted on this one too and it's funny
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:18.160]  because the police officers that are driving this thing around town are all
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:23.800]  guys I went to school with. Well you belong to them now boy. Hey you are
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:27.280]  their property. Get ready for it. I appreciate your call. You better change
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:30.720]  your name to some illegal alien and identity and then you'll they'll start
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:34.640]  bowling down if they see you. Oh my gosh he's illegal. Oh you can drunk drive sir.
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:38.240]  You can kill whoever you want. You can attack people and rob sanctuary city. Oh
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:41.880]  you get in state tuition. You're not from here. We worship you but if you're a
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:47.720]  citizen you are marked as a slob slave who is you are the pre-animal. It's like
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:51.200]  they're coyotes and you're a cottontail rabbit because we act like
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:55.040]  cottontail rabbits. We don't act like predators. We don't act like our
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:19:00.040]  forefathers did. Mainly because we drank poison water. I mean imagine we live in
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:02.640]  a country where the Pentagon runs everything and they poison the water
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:06.520]  and the Pentagon guys all drink tap water killing themselves and killing their
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:09.840]  kids and they think it's fun and oh it's so good and Alex Jones is a cuckoo
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:14.160]  and evil and oh we've got to get any so dangerous. All you fools that work for
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:17.320]  the system you're just literally killing yourselves. Everything we're saying is
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:21.520]  true. It's all documented. It's real. You can't deny anymore but you don't care
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:25.680]  because you feel the petty authority. So you will be destroyed by your own
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:32.120]  system and here I am strapped to a rocket blasting off into the stratosphere
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:39.520]  and it's scary. I don't have what you'd call palpable fear but there's still
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:43.480]  almost like an awe and and I can't believe the position I'm in. I can't
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:48.120]  believe I've got all the enemy operators going after me but just I'm
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:51.480]  trusting in God ladies and gentlemen because I can I think it's a good
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:55.120]  chance they're gonna state stage something in late April but by exposing it
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:58.440]  we may stop them but things are about to get a lot rougher ladies and gentlemen
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:03.840]  we'll be right back. We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are

[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:51.880]  going green may make you mean ethical consumers less likely to be kind and
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:58.000]  more likely to steal study finds they have never found anyone this criminally
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.920]  inclined into these double-blind secret studies they found people that say
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:08.680]  they're a rabid environmentalist will steal will lie and see their fellow man
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:12.240]  is absolute scum and trash well they're parasites they have a parasite instinct
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:18.400]  they're lazy on average they're hateful and then they go and con nice people to
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.960]  give them money to fund their environmental movement that has nothing
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:25.040]  to do with the environment but don't worry Al Gore this is out of the business
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:30.440]  and media Institute Gore attaches global warming as cause to last weekend's
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:34.800]  storm in the northeast vice president points towards weather events as
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:40.880]  evidence of climate change during strategy conference call for supporters
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:44.960]  this is a guy who's been proven to be an absolute liar I mean like he said
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:48.360]  napkin gap was gonna make us have milk and honey in the streets remember he was
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:51.840]  the guy that got that ram through in those Larry King debates making fun of
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:57.200]  Ross Perot calling him a liar well no mr. Gore we know you're the liar with
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:02.120]  Ken lay setting up the carbon credits and your fraud is going down scumbag
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:13.120]  listen to him in this conference call and we have seen that happen in the
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:18.440]  northeast we've seen it happen in the northwest and both of those regions are
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:23.520]  among those that scientists have predicted for a long time would begin to
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:27.800]  experience much larger downpours just look at what has been happening for the
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:34.960]  last three days the so-called skeptics haven't noted it because it's not snow
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:41.600]  but the downpours and heavy winds are consistent with what the scientists have
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:49.400]  long warned about and we now face the opportunity to start doing something
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:55.400]  about this pay him money and continuing to spend billions of dollars on foreign
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:59.880]  oil give it to him we can make a transition to clean energy
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:05.000]  oh that money here at home companies you own renewable energy sources
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:11.160]  creating millions of new jobs oh building new industries making us more secure we
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:15.720]  can address the security threat that I mentioned and incidentally a large
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:19.960]  number of top-ranking generals and admirals have warned that
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:32.560]  oh but if you go to the scores of companies that he spent billions on oh
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:36.880]  yeah he's a multi-billionaire now from this what they do is they go into your
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:40.400]  town or city they take your tax money in the case of Austin they want a 2.6
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:43.200]  billion dollar tax in the next three years they're trying to pass it this
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:47.920]  month they've been having a lot of trouble thank God and then they spend it on
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:54.560]  giant wind farms and solar farms the and and the money goes into these select
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:56.760]  companies pockets but but it's worse than that
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:02.680]  but shari got several million dollars personally hundreds of millions to the
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:07.320]  company to shut down the oldest steelworks oldest facility it was
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:12.720]  brand new it had been just renovated and set up expanded refurbished and to move
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:17.000]  it to India and Pichari owns it and controls it and he's the head of the
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.320]  IPCC so that's the oh yeah it creates millions of jobs it takes your jobs and
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:25.280]  of course in Spain in the last decade that they just did a big study finding
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:30.040]  that every green job costs two jobs this is a government job we know government
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:34.560]  jobs always cost two private jobs in the private sector they don't care the
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:37.640]  banks want us to go more bankrupt they want us to spend more money because it
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:42.600]  all goes to them we go into debt to these people and they just make up the
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:46.840]  money they loan us it's all just zeros and ones in a computer but but that's a
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:54.240]  separate issue from the fraud of high winds rain this is what the scientists
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:29:01.000]  say global warming will do talk about non-science sourcing nothing oh we're
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.400]  having high winds and rain in the springtime in the east something that's
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:13.200]  always happened oh my gosh we're having tornadoes oh my gosh the polar bears are
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:17.000]  dying now they've gone from 20 something thousand to 40 something thousand just in
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:23.240]  Canada alone in the last what 20 years their numbers have doubled that's an
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:28.840]  absolute fact statistic on record no one debates it except Al Gore he just lies
[01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:35.520]  so see snow is global warming when we can't but see now it's not global warming
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:43.360]  its climate change their grandpa is it true that before the global warming that
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:48.440]  the weather never changed that's right Billy it was always 76 degrees if you

[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:45.000]  financial news I wanted to go over housing market sure to double dip MSNBC
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.680]  the housing market will face another retreat while mortgage-backed securities
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:55.440]  and treasuries are likely to go through a material correction the housing market
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:59.800]  surely will double dip Whitney told worldwide exchange government programs
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:03.720]  to support housing have been murky and when the modifications caused by them
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:09.960]  come in to an end a lot of supply may come to the market and that's when real
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:14.760]  estate market is likely to go down folks remember a year and a half ago or
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:19.800]  I guess more than a year and a half ago now October of 2008 we need this 787
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:25.640]  billion dollars we need it right now no questions act give us a blank check to
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:32.120]  unfreeze these mortgage-backed securities or we will have a depression and
[01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:37.400]  then they passed it on the Friday on Saturday less than 24 hours later he
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:41.560]  went on the news shows Henry Paulson with Geithner and others he was then the
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:44.920]  head of the New York Fed to say oh we're not going to use it on that now we're
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:50.080]  not going to say we're going to use it on and that 787 bill is a open window
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:53.720]  they can go every month and get that out and that's only one of three forms of
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:56.800]  lending the Federal Reserve just creates it on its own and gives it to the
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:00.680]  private banks who then wanted to you it but 30% interest on a lot of the credit
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:05.680]  cards now so now they're in the news saying we need another bailout for the
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:09.040]  housing market or there'll be a depression and then oh we're not gonna
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:14.920]  say where the money went just like Iceland they went in there they sold the
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:19.360]  country derivatives the whole time knowing it was gonna go belly up same
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:21.680]  thing with Greece same thing with Chile same thing with every other major
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:26.120]  nation and then Goldman Sachs and others come in with US taxpayer money and
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:31.600]  other bailout money across the world and say okay you will now pay us compounded
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:36.200]  interest and we will own you more money that's made up out of nothing but they
[01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:40.160]  get all the assets and when Iceland said no they said oh you know what okay don't
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:43.160]  worry about that we don't want to make a big deal out of this so you didn't have
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:47.480]  a victory we already own enough assets in your country to go ahead and pay this
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:52.480]  off oh so it was just a total ripoff now the quote we don't know where Greece is
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:56.560]  gonna go but they're now into several months of rioting and a week and a half
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:59.720]  of the most of the aircraft flights being shut down that's in the Associated
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:07.720]  Press the police firemen and others are joining them now and you look at I mean
[01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:11.840]  every country I look at is I mean literally I randomly looked up Nigeria I
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:16.520]  randomly the other night looked up Italy I randomly the other night looked up
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:22.480]  the the president of New Zealand every one of them either the finance minister
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:31.160]  the president or the prime minister in every country I randomly checked and my
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:33.800]  wife walked in and said hey come spend time with the kids I didn't get but I
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:38.360]  checked four five every one of them was run by Goldman Sachs now it's not saying
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:42.400]  Goldman Sachs the only company doing this but they are the insider pilot group
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:46.240]  they're like the Union the private banks go to you know they're the specialized
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:51.920]  group that keeps the criminality in a very small organization
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:57.880]  shelly just got a new president Goldman Sachs so maybe the Goldman Sachs folks
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:01.280]  will start intermarrying and they'll start wearing gold crowns and it'll just
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:08.400]  be the first galactic empire Goldman the Saxonia and just everyone will then I
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:12.440]  pledge allegiance to Goldman Sachs and the Global Union for extermination of
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:17.680]  humanity and to the tyranny for which it stands one enslaved population under
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:28.240]  Goldman Sachs indivisible in bondage with slavery and corruption and poverty
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:35.920]  for all except for Goldman Sachs I pledge allegiance to the New World Order
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:43.160]  well I don't America henceforth pledges itself to the sacred oath of the United
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:49.320]  Nations and a New World Order remember that in the 90s so we've got that going

[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:57.760]  yesterday from Bloomberg this is big news the US and the UK have moved
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:03.120]  substantially closer to losing a AAA credit rating as the cost of servicing
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:06.240]  your debt rose according to Moody's investor service one of the top rating
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:12.200]  agencies and expanding on that top ratings agency warns austerity riots

[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:29.280]  be forced to devalue their currencies in a desperate attempt to offset debt

[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:24.320]  good to you no all right okay mm-hmm top ratings agency Moody's has
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:29.000]  predicted the US and UK could witness similar riots yeah three years ago the
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:32.400]  British Ministry of Defense put this out before they imploded the economy it's
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:36.520]  all planned that we've been telling you about this for over a decade top ratings
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:40.640]  agency Moody's has predicted the US and UK could witness similar riots yeah but
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:45.160]  we drink fluoride problem not as bad takes a lot to get somebody lobotomized
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:49.040]  up off the couch top ratings agency Moody's has predicted the US and UK could
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:52.400]  witness similar riots that they'll see in Greece in response to emergency
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:56.600]  austerity measures imposed by governments in effort to retain their triple
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:01.880]  a credit status but the government keeps growing it's just that all of it's
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:05.960]  got to be paid to the banks growth alone will not resolve an increasingly
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:11.200]  complicated debt equation oh oh you mean how you raped us and set us up that's
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:14.960]  increasingly complicated debt equation that's designed or we can't get out of
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:20.920]  it unless we arrest the bankers growth alone will not resolve an increasing
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:25.840]  complicated debt equation preserving debt affordably at levels consistent with
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:30.440]  triple a ratings will invariably require fiscal adjustments of a magnitude that in
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:36.760]  some cases will test social cohesion said Padre Calla to the chief author of
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:40.520]  the report soaring debt costs will undoubtedly force governments to
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:44.280]  continue to devalue their currencies in a desperate attempt to produce the
[01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:53.000]  burden this will inevitably inevitably it is inevitable this will inevitably
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:57.680]  result in runaway inflation that will double state the value of major
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:02.280]  currencies and eviscerate savings and pensions but don't worry the government
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:05.160]  says they're going to take the pensions over and tax them and give you a small
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:09.400]  part back to protect them you'll thank them oh thank you for stealing most of
[01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:15.600]  it and giving me a small amount back oh thank you SWAT teams the cost of living
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:19.720]  will accelerate as taxes will be raised as the people continue to foot the bill
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:23.240]  for a wealth transfer amount of trillions that has been plundered by
[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:31.920]  offshore banking elite wow pretty strong crumbling paper money for gold
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:35.720]  bullion which has proven to be safer store of wealth for thousands of years
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:43.640]  and it just goes on folks there's a reason that the ADL Southern Primary
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:46.760]  Law Center New York Times Time Magazine and literally hundreds of other
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:52.360]  publications have all declared me the absolute demon of hell and we played it
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:43:01.040]  yesterday in fact cue it back up it's 18 minutes long news agency group like
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:05.080]  where is that article I had it here in front of me we bring me that again but
[01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:09.960]  Patriot Press they went in and talked to the National Director of Research for
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:15.320]  the Southern Poverty Law Center which their job is not to fight the federally
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:21.320]  run Ku Klux Klan and Aryan Nations and Hal Turner admitted Fed FBI operative at
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:25.360]  the highest levels now mainstream New Chicago Tribune Boston Globe Boston
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:32.360]  Herald who attacked me literally every day oh yeah all the big white
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:35.680]  supremacists I mean just openly talk about how they want to kill me they're
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:38.200]  trying to get loaned nuts out there they don't know they're working for feds to
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:42.440]  come after me and you know I just trust in God ladies and gentlemen the death
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:45.680]  threats and everything else from these people and I trust in Smith and Wesson
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:58.160]  but there's a reason that she says on the tape Alex Jones made Popolski kill
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:01.120]  those three cops when the guy was a white supremacist and hated me all over
[01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:05.560]  the web they just make it up in the news within two hours of the cops getting
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:09.200]  killed say it's my fault just like within two hours of the guy flying the
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:14.240]  plane the building London Guardian Austin American statesman New York Daily
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:19.400]  News it's Alex Jones' fault it's my fault why because I am addressing the
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:24.800]  private banks I'm doing what Brigitte Jones dot the year did running out of
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:30.040]  nowhere for parliament last year winning getting a coalition 93% vote to
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:35.840]  say no to the bankers now they're moving to make themselves a new world order
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:42.760]  free zone the public so educated even if the feds stage terror there it won't
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:50.360]  work now we could do this in Greece and everywhere else so I need your prayers
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:53.440]  but more importantly I need all of you to address the bankers point out they're
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:57.920]  the enemy there's thousands of people prominently doing this but because I
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:01.360]  keep beating this drum I realize when I do this it's like jumping out in front
[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:06.080]  of a bus I mean when I send reporters out to confront Geithner at a press
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:10.160]  conference about the stolen trillions and the IRS commissioner looks at my
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:16.320]  and my crew like he's gonna you know just if looks could kill they'd be lying
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:21.440]  on the floor he looked at him with such hate my guys got courage Aaron Dykes
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:26.480]  they all need your prayers and we've got gallows humor around here we've got a
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:30.120]  stiff upper left when you were cheerful what we're doing because we're free men
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:36.160]  free women but again there's a reason we're getting hit from Cointel Pro from
[01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:39.880]  every side and attacked mainstream media grassroots everywhere because these
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:42.920]  people are federally run ladies and gentlemen and then they got useful
[01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:48.320]  idiots that follow them and we are addressing the real enemy here and there
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:52.800]  is no future if we don't say no to this now we're gonna go to break here in a
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:56.000]  moment come back with Nate Ron Donn thinker Bill and others and then I got
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.960]  Kevin Booth coming on with another arm of the police state and Webster
[01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:04.200]  Tarpoli with key false flag that he believes is on the horizon news in the
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:08.360]  last hour but I wanted to bring Ted up for the next three four minutes because
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:17.320]  Ted Ted everybody needs to read this article that Paul Joseph Watson has put

[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:20.680]  wars.com or prisonplanet.com the special offer link is at the bottom of this
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:25.080]  article by Paul Joseph Watson top ratings agency warrants austerity riots
[01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:30.640]  could hit America Ted Anderson I mean there is no doubt they're gonna kill
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:37.280]  all the global currencies one after the other thanks for joining us yeah yeah I'm
[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:40.120]  glad to be with you again you know I picked up an article out of Bloomberg
[01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:44.560]  that shorter had written in 2008 talking about that very issue and at that
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:49.800]  time he was predicted predicting $1,000 gold and when the central bank started
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:53.160]  buying gold rather than being net sellers which they were for 20 years up to
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:58.960]  that point that gold would then climb to $5,000 an ounce and that's what we're
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:02.800]  seeing right now the United States currency the Greek currency though the
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:07.000]  euro everything's under attack and everything's falling and that credit
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.560]  rating that you're talking about earlier Alex for the United States and Britain
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:15.560]  that's a real big factor because if the United States triple a rating gets
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:19.720]  reduced down to double a or something like that it's really gonna increase the
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:24.000]  cost of debt here in the United States and everybody knows that we're in debt
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  up to our ears and that's gonna be just devastating for economy again I don't
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:32.280]  know how to say it enough I mean I'm I'm looking at all sorts of articles I
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:38.520]  mean Reuters has gold rises to 1125 obviously that was written this morning
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:42.040]  they're all watching the Fed thinking that the Federal Reserve is gonna keep
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:45.600]  their interest rates low at a record low I don't know how they can raise the
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:49.840]  interest rates right now with the economy and shambles like it is Alex that
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:54.960]  that forecaster and Frank I've been doing this for about a month now and if
[01:48:54.960 --> 01:49:00.120]  people haven't taken advantage of that man I tell you I I can't make a better
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:03.280]  deal for you than this I mean it's a hundred and fifty nine dollars for the
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:09.240]  subscription right now currently if you call us you're gonna be 261 61 for a
[01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:14.000]  Frank and that is a really good price for the Frank to start with but like you
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:17.160]  said it gets you down to about five hundred dollars an ounce you have to go
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:22.880]  clean back to the middle 2000 era to try to find gold at that price and to be
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:27.080]  clear Ted in the last month you've been offering for the phone calls the free
[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:31.160]  forecaster you're now doing this for people because they asked with a special
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:36.240]  web link that's on prisonplanet.com and info wars.com at the bottom of this
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:40.000]  article that Watson's written that's how people get the same deal online well
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:43.280]  online and they can use a credit card there I know there's a lot of people that
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:47.240]  you know like to buy gold with a credit card and it's very tough for me to do
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:52.240]  because there's so much risk in using credit cards but you can use your credit
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:56.600]  card to buy that gold coin right off of prisonplanet right where that article is

[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:08.800]  hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that
[01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:12.440]  in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or
[01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:16.520]  gold it's true seeds about perform even golden silver before in this country and
[01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:20.120]  it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from

[01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:25.320]  wrong on the subject of this radio show my films going up against the bankers
[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:30.320]  they're scared of us because we have their number we know exactly who they
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:35.440]  are their tricks how they operate we identify them in a nonpartisan non
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:39.880]  religious or racial way they love to balkan eyes and everybody fighting
[01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:44.800]  over sex and religion and the rest of it we just identify the banks what they're
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:49.720]  doing give people a clear choice and if they do kill me God forbid or set me up
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:55.320]  you will then see the absolute Cointel pro come out in mass because if they do
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:55:01.080]  take me out they will then try to legitimize however they do it and you
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:05.320]  will see the enemies all identify themselves at that point so know that
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:09.840]  that'll be something good in a way that would come out of this if people take
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:15.000]  this word to the wise is being sufficient and I'm not saying that's
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.920]  going to happen but I have been physically attacked I have a lot of death
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:23.700]  threats stalked you know things like that but I'm pretty cool headed over the
[01:55:23.700 --> 01:55:26.880]  years and I do have a lot of courage because I'm committed to this and being
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:32.040]  committed past the point of return it's a good feeling but I do want to be able
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:36.240]  to continue my work so pray for us here but they definitely are nationally
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:41.640]  demonizing us in the most horrible ways right now because we are effective and
[01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:46.160]  it's because the message is the truth so if they do take me out no they can't
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:52.120]  get all of you and just continue to set up websites calling to talk radio make
[01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:57.000]  your own films your own podcast flyers expose the phony environmentalist
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:00.920]  expose the gun grabbers expose the North American Union expose the banks as the
[01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:05.800]  enemy and as things get worse and worse just keep beating that drum and people
[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:10.720]  will know the source of all our ills the globalists are the people running and
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:14.760]  we are really the source of our ills by being lackadaisical being decadent being
[01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:18.760]  slovenly not being involved sitting on the sidelines we have allowed them to
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:24.360]  take over you want to know who's really at fault look in the mirror but most of
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:28.800]  you didn't do it consciously I know I didn't do it consciously I didn't wake
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:35.880]  up till I was probably 16 17 years old and then it was a process but what we
[01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:38.920]  are doing is dangerous but it's more dangerous to give in the tyranny it's
[01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:44.080]  more dangerous to just lay down and anybody who's gotten to a level in their
[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:47.800]  life of real research and has a relationship with their creator you
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:52.680]  understand when you're out say in the canyons outside Austin and you see all
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:57.880]  the strata of the millions of years and all the life that's come and gone all
[01:56:57.880 --> 01:57:03.400]  the fossils and you know you drive past the cemetery and you look at old photos
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:07.880]  your great-grandparents you realize that what really matters is the species and
[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:13.720]  our progeny and that we will we live forever as long as the species lives
[01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:18.840]  forever as long as we don't allow the worst elements of society to take over
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:27.200]  the sickening greedy wicked sadistic control fix control freaks and there's
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:30.960]  great comfort in that in knowing that we're part of something larger that
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:37.600]  will live on forever I mean I am my great-great-great-great-grandparents I
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:45.160]  am the genetics I am the blood of the people of the Mayflower and of 1776 and
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:50.520]  of the battle of San Jacinto and so are you all of you are Americans who've been
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:53.920]  part of this all of you are humans regardless of where you live your
[01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:58.760]  ancestors stood up against tyranny in every case because it always gets out of
[01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:01.920]  control people are forced to stand up so we're going through with all our
[01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:06.680]  ancestors have gone through and it's more scientific it's a lot slicker but
[01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:11.640]  it's not gonna work they wouldn't been able to get away with this as far they

[02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:36.840]  Nate and Pennsylvania thanks for holding her on the air I want to thank you
[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:41.040]  personally for everything you're doing here Alex I'm calling from my Lancaster
[02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:47.160]  Pennsylvania this is basically an Amish Mennonite County and Lancaster City
[02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:52.760]  has a population about 55,000 people now we are the big brother capital of the
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:58.280]  United States I'm convinced we have a hundred and sixty-five cameras for 55,000
[02:00:58.280 --> 02:01:02.600]  residents I don't know if anywhere in the nation is aware of this this is more
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:08.120]  a lot of countries I mean a lot of cities do go ahead yeah this is more than
[02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:12.680]  actually a city of Boston and the city of San Francisco and this is just one
[02:01:12.680 --> 02:01:17.480]  aspect of how it is in Pennsylvania another aspect is we're not allowed to
[02:01:17.480 --> 02:01:22.160]  have any bars on any of our windows here it breaks all the fire codes another
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:27.640]  aspect in Pennsylvania is if you sign your Pennsylvania driver's license you
[02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:32.120]  give the right to your blood for any circumstance to the police and if you
[02:01:32.120 --> 02:01:37.080]  remain silent you lose your license a year they make that's happening all over
[02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:40.720]  the country they make you waive your rights to get a driver's license by
[02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:44.280]  saying it's a privilege it is not a privilege and now they're saying owning
[02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:48.800]  guns is a privilege and if we buy this fraud then it will become a reality
[02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:53.800]  yes and this is one of the most passive places in the land I mean this has one
[02:01:53.800 --> 02:01:57.920]  of the best natural soils on American Lancaster County Pennsylvania
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:00.720]  I'm gonna let you go I'm gonna let you go because your phone's breaking up try to

[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:15.760]  that didn't want to listen to them I want to say something to those people that
[02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:22.080]  keep spamming and asking for you to give proof it is not your job to spoon food
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:26.360]  spoon feed people you give them what they need to have they need to get up
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:31.080]  off of their fifth point of contact and actually do the research themselves but
[02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:34.600]  let me say this because people may have just joined us I was specifically
[02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:41.240]  talking about spam against a six-part video from Sunday's TV radio show up
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:45.560]  on my YouTube channel when they did on our website too and I'm holding up the
[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:50.040]  article saying here's the link to the National Council here's the link to the
[02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:54.120]  EPA many fluorides deadly here's a link to the government studies and then the
[02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:58.120]  guys say show us your proof it's all right there I'm showing them the proof
[02:02:58.120 --> 02:03:03.040]  and they're saying it's not proof I am spoon-feeding them and it's not good
[02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:10.080]  enough exactly but the question I have though Alex is a another GNC radio
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:16.720]  host I think her name is Joyce in a power hour yeah you had it on a video of
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:21.760]  her doing interview with one of the Crow Creek Zoo reservation people a while
[02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:26.480]  back and it was basically off the land grab at the IRS conducted and they
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:30.120]  supposed to go on the court sometime this month or last month I was wondering
[02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:33.640]  if you knew anything further about it I hadn't been able to find any update no
[02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:37.040]  I don't that was last year they were trying to take that poor ladies property
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:41.120]  but we'll we'll check into it Ron I appreciate your call Don in Texas you're

[02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:05.880]  I've heard of that I mean listen they have cops that was a famous case in
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:09.720]  Austin but it happens everywhere where they were sitting in the Radisson Hotel
[02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:14.520]  I've actually been there for dinner before at the whole steakhouse there and a
[02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:19.240]  guy who was on a business trip staying there for the night flew in didn't have
[02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:24.120]  a car in a business suit had three Miller lights in an hour and a half
[02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:30.640]  watching a baseball game and they arrested him for being drunk so the cops

[02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:52.880]  the making great filmmaker he made the documentary American drug war and it
[02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:57.320]  aired on Showtime one of their most popular shows of the year they reported
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:11:01.840]  got high ratings and he really made part two of American drug war it's called
[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:07.800]  how weed won the West 14 states passed laws saying this is decriminalized the
[02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:11.800]  feds don't care Obama says he's going to go ahead and legalize then he comes in
[02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:16.360]  and orders 90 plus percent of the dispensaries in major cities in
[02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:20.800]  California shut down so that's how they operate they lie to you and stab you in
[02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:24.640]  the back but here's the issue I've smoked pot in high school and college I
[02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:29.560]  don't really like it but I know that it impairs you a lot less than alcohol and
[02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:35.000]  eat your liver I know it has hundreds of documented glaucoma cancer eating
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:41.440]  disorders study show that Prozac isn't as good for depression as placebo but
[02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:45.200]  marijuana is much better than placebo and I'm not saying smoke it I know a lot
[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:49.240]  of lazy people who are probably already lazy not even lazier smoking pot the
[02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:53.560]  reason we're talking about this is the fake drug war is the way the system
[02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:57.880]  takes control of our society it's the foundation of the snitches the spies the
[02:11:57.880 --> 02:12:01.960]  federalized police the warrantless searches the checkpoints when you make
[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:08.200]  alcohol illegal in the twenties tripled the amount of alcohol poisoning and
[02:12:08.200 --> 02:12:13.040]  alcoholism it empowered the mafia corrupted the police no one debates this
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:18.400]  is admitted fact some European countries have decriminalized drugs drug use
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:23.080]  drops on average by more than half the crime goes down because now you just go
[02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:27.320]  to a government facility or a or a clinic and they treat you like a sick
[02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:31.360]  person you get your heroin or whatever and or they get you on methadone or
[02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:34.440]  whatever and now you're not robbing people's stereos or mugging them to get
[02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:42.120]  your heroin so across the board I say decriminalize again 80 plus years ago
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:48.800]  when you could buy cocaine coca-cola opium lot in them heroin you had much
[02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:52.800]  fewer people and this is admitted mainline history using illegal drugs you
[02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:56.360]  make it illegal Hollywood makes it glamorous people get involved in it
[02:12:56.360 --> 02:13:02.040]  they use it it empowers the drug gangs Mexico is collapsing because of drug
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:06.120]  prohibition no one's debating that nineteen thousand people killed the
[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:10.000]  last three years that's the state department's own numbers u.s. embassy
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:16.720]  staff what four people killed two days ago they're killing cops in the u.s. none
[02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:20.040]  of the drug rings that are government run and some that aren't gonna run they
[02:13:20.040 --> 02:13:23.040]  all want to keep it illegal so it's a no-brainer
[02:13:23.040 --> 02:13:28.840]  decriminalize doesn't mean you sell it at 7-eleven I remember in high school I
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:33.600]  didn't even really like pot but it was easier to get than beer beer was what I
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:38.560]  liked and because it was such controls over alcohol it's the same thing you
[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:42.000]  treat marijuana like alcohol there's going to be less of it ladies and
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:46.640]  gentlemen but I've done ranting about that the point is people need to get how
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:50.480]  weed won the west you can get it in a combo deal with America drug war
[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:54.320]  discounted at info wars dot com but I wanted to go to Kevin Booth and look I
[02:13:54.320 --> 02:14:00.560]  know we've got thinker Bill Curtis Matt Robert Nuthers I'll give you each about
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:03.680]  a minute because I know you're probably not on subject when we go to you but then
[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:07.600]  after that only calls about the fake drug war or do you agree with us do you
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:15.280]  disagree 1-800-259-9231 and I want to talk about a host of issues here
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:20.040]  today with Kevin Booth Kevin good to have you on with us thanks again Alex
[02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:22.800]  thanks so much for having me on and I'd just like to back that up it's funny
[02:14:22.800 --> 02:14:28.480]  when I think back to my days back in high school I didn't like marijuana at all
[02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:34.320]  but I I smoked it anyway just because you you almost have to if you wanted to
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:40.080]  be considered cool or to be accepted into a any of like the cool in groups of
[02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:45.120]  kids let's say you're over you're 17 you're at the cheerleaders house and she
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:49.320]  pulls out some marijuana she's not gonna think you're cool unless you smoke it
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:53.280]  whether no you absolutely have to I'm sure if you go to Amsterdam right now
[02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:57.440]  there's no way that that kind of behavior is taking place I mean the point is
[02:14:57.440 --> 02:15:01.720]  is that kids and people are always gonna do exactly what you tell them not to do
[02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:05.400]  and in a way the government knows that also so I mean they they're playing this
[02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:08.520]  thing on so many different levels but just to back up to something else you're
[02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:13.640]  talking about you know I truly believe that there's no way in the world they
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:17.440]  could have pulled off this New World Order agenda without the drug war I mean
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:22.960]  they had to they had to dumb everybody down they had to they had to make this
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:27.280]  more about than just going to wars about what with other countries and
[02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:31.080]  economics they had to like actually start fiddling with society's brain
[02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:34.240]  chemistry and that's what they've done I mean the government is basically
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:41.880]  controlling you know a huge percentage of our brain chemistry well I've had
[02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:45.000]  countless medical doctors and toxicologists and neurologists on
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:49.400]  Ritalin Prozac all those different classes of drugs the molecules are
[02:15:49.400 --> 02:15:54.640]  incredibly deadly they're toxic I mean you know the heart swelling brain
[02:15:54.640 --> 02:16:00.480]  shrinking brain damage suicide and then meanwhile marijuana has a lot more
[02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:04.840]  attributes than some of the negatives that I've seen and the point is it's an
[02:16:04.840 --> 02:16:08.440]  excuse to put it I mean I remember back in the 60s and 70s reading stories from
[02:16:08.440 --> 02:16:13.280]  then wasn't around in the 60s but reading about it where people get 50 years in
[02:16:13.280 --> 02:16:18.240]  prison for an ounce of marijuana oh yeah I mean I think the first guy went to
[02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:21.880]  jail for almost life or a joint or something like that I forget his name
[02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:26.240]  but he was like the first marijuana prisoner ever he could look it up well
[02:16:26.240 --> 02:16:30.520]  look they know humans for tens of thousands of years have been taken
[02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:34.920]  drugs taken mushrooms for many grapes people like to mess with their brain
[02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:39.440]  we're very addictive species and they know that and how do they make people
[02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:42.800]  slave slaves governments have always wanted slavery but they can't just say
[02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:46.640]  we have slavery now without giving it an excuse so they put out all these
[02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:53.480]  chemicals the CIA introduced LSD the CIA introduced cocaine into the illegal
[02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:57.320]  market that's been admitted knowing people will get it they will get addicted
[02:16:57.320 --> 02:17:00.920]  and now they've got an excuse to put you in a slave camp well I think it's an
[02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:04.120]  interesting point too that you make in the film where you're talking about the
[02:17:04.120 --> 02:17:07.640]  thing that they can't stand about marijuana even with cocaine and heroin
[02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:11.840]  the government the CIA can control those things because they're very centralized
[02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:17.000]  cocaine can only be grown and and only a handful of places on the entire planet
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:22.280]  mostly in you know South America Peru Columbia etc it has to be an exact type
[02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:26.320]  of condition poppies will grow everywhere but the kind of poppies that I
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:29.400]  understand will grow that will grow actual heroin will only grow in very
[02:17:29.400 --> 02:17:33.600]  specific places marijuana grows everywhere it grows in almost every
[02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:38.240]  country it grows everywhere and that's why they they can't stand it and that's
[02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:42.240]  why it's still schedule one when things like heroin and cocaine are scheduled
[02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:45.680]  to I mean the government actually is telling us that heroin and cocaine are
[02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:50.840]  safer than marijuana well let's expand on that I saw the statistic in the
[02:17:50.840 --> 02:17:56.360]  statesman two days ago 100 million Americans are admitted marijuana smokers
[02:17:56.360 --> 02:18:00.280]  now if you look at the statistics of who's tried it they report it's over
[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:06.080]  200 million so two-thirds of people every cop listening out there is younger than
[02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:13.320]  50 I'll bet you a million bucks that that they have smoked marijuana you know
[02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:18.040]  my grandfather when he was dying of cancer and real nauseated with chemo
[02:18:18.040 --> 02:18:23.040]  his buddy the sheriff showed up and said Jerry smoked some of this I hear it
[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:26.800]  makes you be able to eat food he said no I just want to die you know it was about
[02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:30.480]  a month before he died I know I know no this is too painful I'm not gonna
[02:18:30.480 --> 02:18:35.760]  smoke that devil weed basically but you know the issue here is is that the cops
[02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:40.560]  knew this stuff 20 30 years ago they know they know what's going on and if
[02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:45.360]  you've got 86 percent of illegal drug users only use marijuana where's the
[02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:50.320]  drug war gonna go if they don't have that 86 percent to put in prison it was
[02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:54.440]  interesting about it too is that they've tried to demonize the medical use of
[02:18:54.440 --> 02:18:57.760]  marijuana by saying well smoking anything is bad for you well meanwhile
[02:18:57.760 --> 02:19:01.720]  there's still ads for camel and Rolling Stone magazine everywhere you know
[02:19:01.720 --> 02:19:07.200]  there's so you know cigarettes are still legal but the point is is that more and
[02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:10.800]  more people are coming out and saying you know they want to have the health

[02:24:08.160 --> 02:24:13.160]  yeah here's the New York Times article we always document what we claim here
[02:24:13.160 --> 02:24:19.080]  March 11th 2007 give me a document cam shot for prison wanted on TV viewers a
[02:24:19.080 --> 02:24:25.600]  man sentenced to life in prison 17 years ago just 17 years ago this was 20 years
[02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:30.120]  ago now this is from 2007 a man sentenced to life in prison 17 years ago
[02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:33.960]  after smoking marijuana while on probation for his part in armed robbery
[02:24:33.960 --> 02:24:41.520]  is set to be free so smoking marijuana but but that's a more modern case and
[02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:47.040]  that's for breaking parole the bigger issue here is I've seen cases for just
[02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:53.160]  the marijuana 50 years in prison Kevin Booth the point is is that I doubt he
[02:24:53.160 --> 02:24:57.440]  did the robbery while he was high and I know that's an old cliche and there's
[02:24:57.440 --> 02:25:00.880]  several cliches cliches that have to be said over and over again because they're
[02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:04.440]  so they're so ridiculous but you have to keep repeating it about the death
[02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:08.760]  statistics but first of all that is when the police talk about people committing
[02:25:08.760 --> 02:25:12.960]  violent crimes while high most likely they're also extremely drunk at the same
[02:25:12.960 --> 02:25:17.720]  time and they just found some THC in their blood and you know when the when
[02:25:17.720 --> 02:25:23.000]  the DEA and the narcotics task force survey they they talk about the statistic
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:27.440]  about how marijuana is by far the most harmful and destructive drug out there
[02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:31.160]  well I figured out how they come about that number it's really easy if you go
[02:25:31.160 --> 02:25:34.400]  to any kind of like treatment center jail or anything like that where they've
[02:25:34.400 --> 02:25:40.320]  incarcerated people for crystal meth heroin or PCP crack anything like that
[02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:44.480]  you if you ask them to check off the boxes what all do you do most likely
[02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:48.240]  they're all going to check off cigarette beer and what else marijuana so they use
[02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:52.560]  that as a common denominator to say look everyone who does heroin also smoke
[02:25:52.560 --> 02:25:56.480]  marijuana everyone who does crystal meth also smoke marijuana therefore it's a
[02:25:56.480 --> 02:25:59.880]  gateway drug and that's how they come upon that conclusion well it's a gateway
[02:25:59.880 --> 02:26:03.720]  drug because they make it illegal and lump it in with cocaine and heroin so
[02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:07.360]  people then get into the circles that are already doing illegal things no
[02:26:07.360 --> 02:26:10.280]  exactly and that's it that's what this whole dispensary thing is all about
[02:26:10.280 --> 02:26:14.320]  right now whether people think this whole medical marijuana is just a front to
[02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:19.200]  get higher whatever it leads to the way of taking marijuana out of the criminal
[02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:25.360]  camp well I can I pull in why can you or I or anybody pull in over 21 and by a
[02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:29.080]  gallon of vodka and go kill ourselves with it and that's fine and we know
[02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:34.360]  alcohol kills hundreds of thousands a year marijuana zero but that's okay but
[02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:37.440]  people shouldn't be able to go into a dispensary with a doctor's note and get
[02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:42.120]  marijuana well I mean maybe that's what the government wanted to do maybe the
[02:26:42.120 --> 02:26:45.800]  government wants us to buy products that they can tax and then kill ourselves
[02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:49.200]  I don't know I was talking to a lobbyist a few weeks ago works at the Texas
[02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:52.760]  Capitol and he was he was saying I know it's true the alcohol lobby and the
[02:26:52.760 --> 02:26:57.080]  cigarette lobby are some of the biggest donors to keep marijuana illegal why is
[02:26:57.080 --> 02:27:02.480]  that Kevin of course because they you know because they would lose so much I
[02:27:02.480 --> 02:27:08.000]  mean if marijuana were legal across the board so many people would would smoke
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:12.080]  pot instead of drinking beer or smoke a little weed instead of smoking cigarettes
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:17.360]  it is just obvious painfully off well on the National Archives you can pull up
[02:27:17.360 --> 02:27:25.200]  notes to George Washington's care for his two thanks and they're telling him
[02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:30.080]  smoke this variety of hemp which is the variety that has the THC so George
[02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:34.440]  Washington was smoking it I guess he deserves life in prison well and that
[02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:40.440]  alone should be the only reason if some people out there who are still thinking
[02:27:40.440 --> 02:27:44.160]  you know like oh it makes people dumb makes people hide you to say legal no I
[02:27:44.160 --> 02:27:49.080]  mean if the founding father did it and wrote about it that's case closed it's
[02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:52.680]  argument over and and they and they know that either that or go live the world
[02:27:52.680 --> 02:27:57.920]  apart the founding father of our country did this thing so highly of it that
[02:27:57.920 --> 02:28:02.400]  that's the end of the argument he grew it he grew the type of marijuana not
[02:28:02.400 --> 02:28:05.640]  just him and that's another thing they banned in the country all the hemp that
[02:28:05.640 --> 02:28:09.840]  has no THC that's better than cotton I mean it's something farmers can grow
[02:28:09.840 --> 02:28:14.240]  anywhere the cotton lobbies lobbied to have it banned because they then had
[02:28:14.240 --> 02:28:18.560]  machines that could remove and strip and use it so they said oh my god let's
[02:28:18.560 --> 02:28:23.600]  let's ban this no of course why don't they at least legalize the hemp well
[02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:27.320]  because they I think they they feel like if they legalize hemp and it's gonna
[02:28:27.320 --> 02:28:31.360]  everybody can grow marijuana no one can know the difference but also then a
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:35.560]  handful but you know I think when they came out with polyester I think that
[02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:40.720]  was another big lobby against it you know the big polyester movement you
[02:28:40.720 --> 02:28:44.680]  know viewers I was maybe a little bit before your time when I was growing up
[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:47.920]  all of a sudden every you know everyone wanted to wear polyester clothing that
[02:28:47.920 --> 02:28:51.600]  was the thing and supposedly that had a lot to do with wanting to keep hemp out
[02:28:51.600 --> 02:28:55.800]  of the market yeah Dow Chemical and DuPont lobbied in the 30s to get the
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:29:01.160]  drug laws passed I want to talk about how we won the West and take some phone
[02:29:01.160 --> 02:29:05.000]  calls Kevin when we come back because the film covers a whole host of issues and
[02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:08.360]  there's a lot more hardcore on government drug dealing and everything else
[02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:13.680]  than even American drug war though the name you know it isn't as hardcore in my
[02:29:13.680 --> 02:29:16.040]  opinion I mean I like the name but I don't like it because it doesn't really
[02:29:16.040 --> 02:29:21.720]  explain they're now saying in Canada in Europe and now McCain's bill they do
[02:29:21.720 --> 02:29:29.560]  want to make vitamin C other things plants aloe vera Maloluga prescription
[02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:33.840]  fish oil prescription and they want to use the same type marijuana laws to do
[02:29:33.840 --> 02:29:38.280]  it so folks they've built up this grid and they're gonna try to use it to keep
[02:29:38.280 --> 02:29:42.040]  them getting your vitamins and minerals so they're not gonna stop there big
[02:29:42.040 --> 02:29:45.440]  farmer wants to knock out his competition it's following the drug war
[02:29:45.440 --> 02:29:49.640]  paradigm playbook to get that job done we'll be right back with Kevin Booth I'm

[02:33:01.080 --> 02:33:22.400]  this is fitting music folks it's a joke they just demonize everything as a
[02:33:22.400 --> 02:33:26.280]  pretext to get regular people in the criminal justice system and when they
[02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:31.920]  made marijuana illegal a lot more people started using it if you go back into
[02:33:31.920 --> 02:33:36.720]  the 30s and before that the 20s it was very few people some Hispanics in the
[02:33:36.720 --> 02:33:42.720]  southwest black communities smoked it some was called reefer that's the term
[02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:45.760]  they use for reefer madness where it shows people murdering everybody when
[02:33:45.760 --> 02:33:50.000]  they smoke marijuana and then they made it illegal and now it's one of the most
[02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:54.560]  popular drugs in use now it has a lot of medical uses there's no other plant we
[02:33:54.560 --> 02:34:00.920]  know of that has this many uses I mean it's it's really an incredible plant but
[02:34:00.920 --> 02:34:05.720]  I want to go to some of your phone calls here from anti-federalist Ruth and
[02:34:05.720 --> 02:34:10.920]  others that are patiently holding the toll-free number 1-800-259-9231 I
[02:34:10.920 --> 02:34:13.040]  have some other callers that we're holding from earlier we'll go to them
[02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:17.520]  too but Kevin other points you want to make about how weed won the west and
[02:34:17.520 --> 02:34:23.040]  this is also a 10th amendment issue of states rights what are the feds doing
[02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:26.760]  just like telling Montana you can't make your own guns Tennessee you can't when
[02:34:26.760 --> 02:34:30.360]  clearly on the constitutional they they can if they're not sold outside the
[02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:37.960]  state why can't California or other 13 other states you decriminalize this why
[02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:43.160]  are the feds in there in their business no I mean it is completely almost like
[02:34:43.160 --> 02:34:47.000]  medieval like the old days of having that people come from the kingdom to tax
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:51.240]  you you know I mean it people out here in California thousands of miles away
[02:34:51.240 --> 02:34:57.280]  from Washington DC just trying to live their lives and survive economically
[02:34:57.280 --> 02:35:01.320]  any way that they can and treat their their illnesses the best that they know
[02:35:01.320 --> 02:35:05.800]  how and having the feds come in you know over and over again and even
[02:35:05.800 --> 02:35:10.400]  regardless of what Obama said the DBA is just been in town just within the last
[02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:14.040]  week or so passing people again you know they're they're said to be trying to
[02:35:14.040 --> 02:35:19.360]  shut down nine over 900 of the 1000 dispensaries right now it is it's a war
[02:35:19.360 --> 02:35:22.600]  out here right now I mean it's there's war on the streets right now is what
[02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:25.960]  these people are doing you know anyway what's funny too when you're talking
[02:35:25.960 --> 02:35:30.200]  about how reefer was unknown you know you know you always talk about how the
[02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:35.040]  new old-order plan is like backfires on them well the whole marijuana thing is
[02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:39.120]  backfired on them too because what they've done you know by by putting it
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:43.160]  into mainstream culture and demonizing it and making it cool all those things
[02:35:43.160 --> 02:35:48.080]  you talk about is they've also created an entire society of people a whole
[02:35:48.080 --> 02:35:52.520]  generations of people that have become expert growers and have now cultivated
[02:35:52.520 --> 02:35:58.200]  marijuana up into new heights and you know and we compare the marijuana now
[02:35:58.200 --> 02:36:01.520]  to like the fine wine vineyards of northern California where you have all
[02:36:01.520 --> 02:36:05.640]  these different strains and these people that all take pride in their strains and
[02:36:05.640 --> 02:36:08.400]  you know you could go to the different ranches up there in the Emerald Triangle
[02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:12.000]  and everybody has their own little way of doing things you know and this is all
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:17.960]  a result from them trying to outlaw it and demonize it so you know I think
[02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:23.840]  history repeats itself and and anytime you try to squash people like this it's
[02:36:23.840 --> 02:36:27.080]  just gonna rise up and in the DEA still comes out and they'll say well the
[02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:32.600]  marijuana today is 70 percent stronger than it was back in the 60s you know and
[02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:36.280]  that's another reason why it should be so bad well yeah but now the pot smokers
[02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:39.880]  I know they just take one or two hits instead of smoking three joints exactly
[02:36:39.880 --> 02:36:43.840]  because it's the smoke that's bad for you okay smoking anything is bad for you
[02:36:43.840 --> 02:36:47.640]  know I mean as you know because it's anything like this dust you know breathing
[02:36:47.640 --> 02:36:51.880]  dust is bad for you putting anything in your lungs is bad for you yeah so the
[02:36:51.880 --> 02:36:56.320]  whole thing is that the new marijuana is cleaned if you get the good stuff it's
[02:36:56.320 --> 02:37:01.240]  organic it's not grown with chemicals and you just take one or two hits a lot of
[02:37:01.240 --> 02:37:07.120]  people use vaporizers now and you know it's not anything you know it you'd
[02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:11.440]  have to smoke a hundred joints probably to equal a pack of cigarettes as far as
[02:37:11.440 --> 02:37:16.360]  as long damage goes well regardless the government is laundering the hard drug
[02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:20.800]  money they're on record dealing it and it's time for everybody to come out
[02:37:20.800 --> 02:37:24.840]  Ventura is doing it in his book you're doing it your film and just say stop it
[02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:29.160]  we know it's also proven to that the that's when they come out here and
[02:37:29.160 --> 02:37:33.120]  they're rating these dispensaries that they keep the money and they keep the
[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:38.400]  pot and then they resell the pot well did you see the AP article were both the
[02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:43.080]  courthouse shooter in Nevada and the Pentagon shooter both got their guns
[02:37:43.080 --> 02:37:48.400]  from a police lockup in Tennessee that were confiscated guns that sounds like
[02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:53.440]  a federal operation to me right there yeah I mean my point is is that the cops
[02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:58.280]  are incredibly corrupt all over the country and we know they're making payoffs
[02:37:58.280 --> 02:38:04.680]  and what are they gonna do though as 60 70 80 now in some polls 90% want drug
[02:38:04.680 --> 02:38:09.200]  decriminalization across the board but the drug dealers and the police and the
[02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:12.360]  government want to keep it illegal because they're making all the money you
[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:15.960]  know and and they they always try to like say well what's next crystal meth
[02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:19.920]  that we legalize this when the last time you're ever gonna you know when are you
[02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:24.320]  ever gonna see them having like a big freedom march or a free the meth march
[02:38:24.320 --> 02:38:29.080]  people love marijuana it's on a different level and you know and that just
[02:38:29.080 --> 02:38:32.520]  reminds me that we have like 420 day coming up and you know not that I'm
[02:38:32.520 --> 02:38:36.840]  into any kind of numerology or anything like that but as you know April 20th is
[02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:41.480]  like the big day for marijuana smokers and we're trying to get screenings going
[02:38:41.480 --> 02:38:44.600]  all over the country including we're gonna be at the Toronto Freedom Festival
[02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:49.080]  up there on 420 so I just wanted to shout out to everybody who wants to set up
[02:38:49.080 --> 02:38:54.240]  a 420 screening to get a hold of us it's great absolutely now now Kevin
[02:38:54.240 --> 02:39:00.800]  separately though and I want to go to some calls in a moment dealing with
[02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:06.120]  marijuana the establishment is clearly losing the war so what Obama has done
[02:39:06.120 --> 02:39:10.040]  is they're going to the state saying fine you can have some dispensaries but
[02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:14.080]  you can't have a thousand dispensaries in your city you can only have 75 and then
[02:39:14.080 --> 02:39:18.520]  select people get to have those dispensaries so it's another monopoly
[02:39:18.520 --> 02:39:24.200]  being set up no exactly I mean it's probably who all is gonna you know I
[02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:27.720]  mean I don't I don't know for a fact but you know the people that are gonna be
[02:39:27.720 --> 02:39:31.640]  left standing you know they're gonna be the ones that have to be buddying up to
[02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:36.120]  these people and that will drive up the price of marijuana again and keep the
[02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:40.200]  illegal market going I mean it's amazing I mean all the all the street
[02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:43.240]  dealers I you know I know a handful of street dealers especially ones I've
[02:39:43.240 --> 02:39:47.480]  interviewed the thing I mean they are they are happy happy happy happy happy
[02:39:47.480 --> 02:39:51.440]  about all these dispensaries being shut down because they have lost all their
[02:39:51.440 --> 02:39:55.120]  business you can't you know go into the corner to buy your marijuana from the
[02:39:55.120 --> 02:40:00.520]  crack dealer with the norm in the 80s in the 90s that no more why would you go
[02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:03.840]  to the corner to buy marijuana from some creepy guy when you know you can get
[02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:08.200]  the best of the best at some store with well-lit and with security guards up
[02:40:08.200 --> 02:40:13.200]  front well the globalists want to keep everything in the shadows so they can
[02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:17.120]  control it and get the money out of it let's talk to anti-federalists from
[02:40:17.120 --> 02:40:21.720]  Georgia you're on the air go ahead hey guys I wanted to make a comment first
[02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:26.880]  about the film American drug war I wanted to say that it's one of the if not
[02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:31.000]  the only film I've ever seen on the drug war it wasn't apologetic it didn't
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:36.000]  really go after the medical marijuana but actually went after the real issues
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:40.600]  about the actual drug war and the government's involvement but my question
[02:40:40.600 --> 02:40:44.640]  is you had mentioned before when you were on the show about some of the
[02:40:44.640 --> 02:40:49.240]  dispensaries being having feds and control of them or at least some of them
[02:40:49.240 --> 02:40:52.720]  working with the with the federal government and I'm just curious what
[02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:58.720]  your thoughts are as far as them trying to I guess cultivate a kind of
[02:40:58.720 --> 02:41:05.840]  Monsanto kind of commercialization if it were to be decriminalized yeah the big
[02:41:05.840 --> 02:41:08.920]  cigarette makers have gone into California and are buying up all the key
[02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:13.080]  growing area they're clearly getting ready to have it where the cigarette
[02:41:13.080 --> 02:41:16.200]  makers have it they can manipulate the genetics they can add chemicals to it
[02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:21.240]  Kevin well there's a lot of a lot of word out amongst the growers that I
[02:41:21.240 --> 02:41:28.040]  know that uh that there's probably only going to be a small gap of time for all
[02:41:28.040 --> 02:41:31.640]  these people that have spent their whole lives creating all these strains and all
[02:41:31.640 --> 02:41:35.600]  that for from the time that it's legalized to the time that major
[02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:39.440]  corporations take it all over there's probably going to be about a one-year
[02:41:39.440 --> 02:41:44.000]  lot there for all these people to basically cash in on the last 20 years of
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:48.920]  their of their work and that's bad but that's what everybody thinks is really
[02:41:48.920 --> 02:41:53.360]  gonna happen you know giant corporation will swoop down and take over this whole
[02:41:53.360 --> 02:41:56.960]  thing and so it's still really going to be illegal select corporations will be
[02:41:56.960 --> 02:42:00.080]  able to do it and they're still going to put your kids in jail or they catch
[02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:03.560]  them with it we've got to have real decriminalization not the
[02:42:03.560 --> 02:42:08.480]  corporatization a lot to do with strains to there's a lot of word out
[02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:12.280]  saying that you know the government will now have certain strains that you're
[02:42:12.280 --> 02:42:16.960]  allowed to have and if you're caught using you know illegal strain you know
[02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:19.760]  it'll be the kind of thing where you know they'll they'll confiscate your
[02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:23.360]  marijuana and test it and if it's not the right kind of marijuana you can get
[02:42:23.360 --> 02:42:27.000]  in trouble if it's not the government approved strain like the government will
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:30.840]  own the patent on like you know a certain amount and you know Monsanto's gonna
[02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:34.320]  come out with a Prozac strain or something I mean of course there I'm
[02:42:34.320 --> 02:42:38.120]  sure they're working on it right now there's no telling what all you know
[02:42:38.120 --> 02:42:41.800]  they're gonna exactly though they'll it'll have the same exact effect that
[02:42:41.800 --> 02:42:46.120]  they'll get all the pot smokers to like take prozac anyways right let's talk to
[02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:52.160]  Ruth and Louisiana you're on the air Ruth yes hello Alex I've been praying
[02:42:52.160 --> 02:43:00.040]  for you every day thank you I will tell well I have to two comments one's
[02:43:00.040 --> 02:43:09.280]  personal but the first one is if it wasn't for marijuana in 2000 I would be
[02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:15.440]  dead really I got a condition called cyclic vomiting syndrome which is
[02:43:15.440 --> 02:43:23.000]  migraine in the stomach already had migraines on my life but I went down to
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:30.960]  85 pounds couldn't eat couldn't do anything I just finally told my husband
[02:43:30.960 --> 02:43:36.520]  you gotta go find me some which he did did it late at night because the
[02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:41.800]  children were small for time I didn't want them to know what I was up to and
[02:43:41.800 --> 02:43:51.440]  it saved my life I was able to eat keep my food down got my weight back but now
[02:43:51.440 --> 02:43:58.920]  I have to take more fees for the rest of my life and unfortunately I have to be
[02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:05.800]  tested every month let me expand on that go ahead Kevin
[02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:09.280]  I said move to California yeah I know you're right it's real sad I just went
[02:44:09.280 --> 02:44:13.440]  back to Texas not too long ago and I have some extremely sick family members
[02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:17.720]  and relatives there and it just breaks my heart where I'm just like oh my god
[02:44:17.720 --> 02:44:22.320]  you guys you know first of all yeah smoking is not good for you but for
[02:44:22.320 --> 02:44:26.040]  certain things like nausea you've ever woken up in the middle of the night with
[02:44:26.040 --> 02:44:29.880]  like heartburn or really horrible stomachache is taking a pill or putting
[02:44:29.880 --> 02:44:35.780]  anything like that smoking is a really good way or vaporizing is a really good
[02:44:35.780 --> 02:44:40.760]  way of taking a drug for nausea it's Bible Ruth I appreciate your call let
[02:44:40.760 --> 02:44:46.360]  me just say this by dealing with the nausea that is the medically approved the
[02:44:46.360 --> 02:44:51.320]  feds even admit that marijuana is amazing for people that have chemo that
[02:44:51.320 --> 02:44:55.160]  can't hold food down and I don't have a lot of migraines I think they're
[02:44:55.160 --> 02:45:02.000]  triggered by pollen because the only times I have them was when five six years
[02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:06.560]  ago four years ago or so I started having them a couple times a year because
[02:45:06.560 --> 02:45:10.480]  I would go on these long bike rides when the cedar was dropping two or three
[02:45:10.480 --> 02:45:13.680]  times a year and I am allergic to the cedar pollen and I would breathe so
[02:45:13.680 --> 02:45:19.640]  much of it that one time I got totally dizzy it was a migraine pulled over I
[02:45:19.640 --> 02:45:23.000]  was vomiting on the side of the road you know you can't I mean just it hellish
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:28.560]  and so that those the type of migraines I have where you're just vomiting and
[02:45:28.560 --> 02:45:32.400]  vomiting and vomiting and it's it's a level of pain I've never experienced and
[02:45:32.400 --> 02:45:37.280]  that's a good idea maybe I should but luckily it hardly ever happens because
[02:45:37.280 --> 02:45:41.120]  I don't ride bikes when the cedars out anymore because I figured out every time
[02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:44.760]  I would do that in heavy cedar it would I would just breathe so much of it it
[02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:48.280]  would literally just make my brain have an autoimmune response to all that pollen
[02:45:48.280 --> 02:45:53.720]  in my sinus and felt like I was dying but maybe that's the answer but then I
[02:45:53.720 --> 02:45:58.400]  have they have vaporizers and how these where you can actually you can actually
[02:45:58.400 --> 02:46:02.000]  use these things in a movie theater and no one will even know they're using it
[02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:07.120]  it's absolutely amazing some of the new little gadgets they have out to be able
[02:46:07.120 --> 02:46:10.320]  to use let me tell you the worst pain I've ever felt is a migraine you've
[02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:14.960]  read a migraine headache Kevin oh yeah I get them all the time oh really not
[02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:20.040]  when not all the time but I yeah I know what a migraine oh my god I'm sure God
[02:46:20.040 --> 02:46:23.240]  how could how could Alex Jones not get migraines the ones you're just built out
[02:46:23.240 --> 02:46:26.920]  of steel or something like that I can't listening to you gives me a migraine
[02:46:26.920 --> 02:46:34.960]  someday I can't imagine a good way Alex Jones gives you will guarantee
[02:46:34.960 --> 02:46:38.600]  give you a migraine no no you're out there fighting the fight so all of us
[02:46:38.600 --> 02:46:45.800]  lazy flops can lay around yeah but the first time I had a migraine I was about
[02:46:45.800 --> 02:46:51.920]  25 and my girlfriend was over now my wife I was 26 and I thought I was dying
[02:46:51.920 --> 02:46:56.760]  and I called my dad and I said I'm dizzy blurred vision I'm throwing up this is
[02:46:56.760 --> 02:47:02.200]  the worst pain in my life he said you got a migraine son and he was right but
[02:47:02.200 --> 02:47:07.640]  my who people that have migraines every day I don't know how they deal with it
[02:47:07.640 --> 02:47:11.880]  I bet the medical evidence show that it helps that marijuana helps migraines
[02:47:11.880 --> 02:47:18.600]  because I read that for some people you know yeah definitely it is different
[02:47:18.600 --> 02:47:22.200]  strains for different people all different types of ways doing it I think
[02:47:22.200 --> 02:47:26.800]  for some people for headaches actually ingesting it might work better than
[02:47:26.800 --> 02:47:30.840]  smoking it I mean it's just different it's the kind of thing where you have
[02:47:30.840 --> 02:47:34.840]  to kind of find out like what works for you but the good thing is that you can
[02:47:34.840 --> 02:47:39.120]  it you can just safely experiment without really risking anything to kind of
[02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:42.800]  find out like you know do you want to be high you don't want to be high you want
[02:47:42.800 --> 02:47:46.520]  to be sleepy do you want to be awake you you know just all the different things
[02:47:46.520 --> 02:47:50.160]  that you can kind of feel your way around to like finding what works for you
[02:47:50.160 --> 02:47:55.360]  in a very safe fashion and that's like the the main thing that doctors and all
[02:47:55.360 --> 02:47:59.880]  these people that don't want to see all these you know they don't want cures they
[02:47:59.880 --> 02:48:03.040]  just want the pharmaceutical companies want to just be able to just treat
[02:48:03.040 --> 02:48:06.280]  everybody's symptoms you know and they don't want to cure anything and that's
[02:48:06.280 --> 02:48:10.200]  you know going back to the codex elementary you're talking about

[02:48:34.800 --> 02:48:40.280]  good hey I just wanted to share a little bit some of the family my family
[02:48:40.280 --> 02:48:45.040]  struggles one of my cousins actually from a little kid was just this immense
[02:48:45.040 --> 02:48:49.200]  rage and they went to the doctors and the doctors gave them all sorts of drugs
[02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:54.160]  he was on riddle and Prozac I mean there was probably half a dozen to a dozen of
[02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:58.440]  adult strength drugs given this five and six year old and it wasn't until they
[02:48:58.440 --> 02:49:02.760]  got a prescription for marijuana that he basically said the trash gem and his
[02:49:02.760 --> 02:49:06.360]  head just cleared away I mean and when he was on these drugs he actually woke up
[02:49:06.360 --> 02:49:09.760]  in the middle of the night with a nice tone his mom you know he heard these
[02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:13.200]  voices and they're telling him to kill her oh no yeah Prozac and all that makes
[02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:18.240]  you go crazy and the Ritalin and the other speed drugs are very similar to
[02:49:18.240 --> 02:49:21.640]  the methamphetamine but the cops are old methamphetamines very bad but let's
[02:49:21.640 --> 02:49:26.400]  make your kids take methamphetamine pills which on the insert says causes
[02:49:26.400 --> 02:49:29.960]  delusions and psychopathic behavior and yeah a lot of these kids are on Ritalin
[02:49:29.960 --> 02:49:35.800]  Prozac they stack five or six drugs the average foster child more than two
[02:49:35.800 --> 02:49:39.920]  thirds of foster children are on psychotropics and the average child who's
[02:49:39.920 --> 02:49:43.040]  on him is on seven
[02:49:43.640 --> 02:49:48.880]  go ahead he he was about like I said from the time he was five to six all
[02:49:48.880 --> 02:49:53.040]  because he was angry and it wasn't until he got the weed but then they started
[02:49:53.040 --> 02:49:56.680]  going public with it they were on Montel Williams they had a CBS 48 hours thing
[02:49:56.680 --> 02:50:00.760]  and all of a sudden their dispensary got raided and they were no longer able to
[02:50:00.760 --> 02:50:04.480]  get the marijuana to give to him and they wouldn't even tell them they're
[02:50:04.480 --> 02:50:07.280]  giving him marijuana they would bake it and give it to him in capital we call
[02:50:07.280 --> 02:50:12.160]  amino acids you know and all that well it's worse than that I mean it's worse
[02:50:12.160 --> 02:50:17.600]  than that they know this is helping people and they just don't want you to
[02:50:17.600 --> 02:50:21.280]  have access to it that's another thing though Kevin some of the people you

[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:44.160]  not funny to the family we shouldn't laugh folks that's very hurtful that

[03:00:28.160 --> 03:00:34.800]  ethical consumers less likely to be kind and more likely to steal major study
[03:00:34.800 --> 03:00:45.240]  fines and that dovetails with this piece of the London Guardian oh yes they found
[03:00:45.240 --> 03:00:52.920]  that there are many times more likely to steal you name it I also want to get
[03:00:52.920 --> 03:00:58.240]  into an important report about public schools around the world or the
[03:00:58.240 --> 03:01:02.960]  reporting that they're basically like prisons now and that is the entire point
[03:01:02.960 --> 03:01:10.480]  that's what's going on here also we've got Webster Griffin Tarpoli coming up
[03:01:10.480 --> 03:01:19.120]  here in just a moment he's written a story we've got up on info wars.com in
[03:01:19.120 --> 03:01:23.040]  fact will you guys go ahead and pull that up for me it's one of the info wars.com
[03:01:23.040 --> 03:01:28.320]  headlines I forgot to print it where he talks about false flag likely because I
[03:01:28.320 --> 03:01:33.560]  want to go over that report and for some reason oh no I found it US ready cyber
[03:01:33.560 --> 03:01:43.520]  war virtual flag terrorism and that ties in with this info wars.com report we
[03:01:43.520 --> 03:01:48.080]  first picked it up on WikiLeaks then it was picked up by the register and the
[03:01:48.080 --> 03:01:58.760]  BBC and in fact here is the BBC headline US plans to fight the net revealed
[03:01:58.760 --> 03:02:04.760]  and they talk about how the internet is an enemy weapons system and that their
[03:02:04.760 --> 03:02:09.840]  big enemy is WikiLeaks because WikiLeaks got a secret document a few
[03:02:09.840 --> 03:02:14.920]  months ago where the army was illegally spying on Americans in non-terror
[03:02:14.920 --> 03:02:19.600]  related cases they got another document where a army intelligence chief was
[03:02:19.600 --> 03:02:25.880]  using spies for his own private operations in fact I forgot to print that
[03:02:25.880 --> 03:02:30.320]  I am it this morning but I didn't see it in my stack guys it was out in mainstream
[03:02:30.320 --> 03:02:35.840]  news yesterday army intel chief used operatives for his own private business
[03:02:35.840 --> 03:02:42.120]  I think it's the headline I want to get that story as well to to cover that
[03:02:42.120 --> 03:02:46.840]  coming up and we're also going to talk to terribly about US UK move closer to
[03:02:46.840 --> 03:02:53.680]  losing rating Moody's says open discussion of dollar default or
[03:02:53.680 --> 03:03:01.000]  devaluation or our credit line our bonds being rated more like Mexico or
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:06.320]  Argentina or something we'll also talk to terribly about the exciting news from
[03:03:06.320 --> 03:03:10.720]  Iceland saying no to the banker take over what's happening in Greece what
[03:03:10.720 --> 03:03:14.680]  nations terribly believes with the next dominoes to fall how successful will the
[03:03:14.680 --> 03:03:18.600]  international banking cartel be the communist Chinese are saying they may
[03:03:18.600 --> 03:03:24.840]  dump the dollar now so that is all coming up today in fact that was a London
[03:03:24.840 --> 03:03:27.880]  Telegraph article I sent you and again I didn't see that in the stack maybe it's
[03:03:27.880 --> 03:03:33.520]  here it was the London Telegraph story I meant to get it earlier now it's time
[03:03:33.520 --> 03:03:37.960]  for Tarpley and I need to have it in front of me talking about the hubris
[03:03:37.960 --> 03:03:44.560]  of China and their statements and how all this incredible stuff is about to
[03:03:44.560 --> 03:03:51.240]  happen and how China is threatening the United States and they likened it to
[03:03:51.240 --> 03:03:57.680]  what Tarpley compared it to a few months ago here how England saw Germany as this
[03:03:57.680 --> 03:04:02.320]  rising power in World War one sort of World War one with them and they
[03:04:02.320 --> 03:04:06.720]  similarly but taking the British position say China is bad like Germany
[03:04:06.720 --> 03:04:11.600]  before World War one and the United States is going to be getting in their
[03:04:11.600 --> 03:04:18.280]  face so that is coming up as well here today with Webster Griffin Tarpley in

[03:09:02.160 --> 03:09:08.680]  and I always enjoy his perspectives also we're gonna get into US plans to fight
[03:09:08.680 --> 03:09:13.880]  the net revealed now they've admitted this the last two years that cyber
[03:09:13.880 --> 03:09:17.640]  security is taking over the Pentagon is taking over the infrastructure they're
[03:09:17.640 --> 03:09:22.040]  going to restrict they're going to higher provocateurs cast Sunstein tax
[03:09:22.040 --> 03:09:27.000]  conspiracy theories IE questioning government anthropogenic global warming
[03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:32.720]  everything is to be illegal just incredible things happening open talk of
[03:09:32.720 --> 03:09:39.400]  more war with Iran news reports of more US forces moving into Diego Garcia and
[03:09:39.400 --> 03:09:47.680]  other areas and then separately this article is China's
[03:09:47.680 --> 03:09:53.320]  Politburo spoiling for a showdown with America this is the London telegraph
[03:09:53.320 --> 03:09:56.160]  today in fact can I have a document cam shot of this boys for the prison planet
[03:09:56.160 --> 03:10:01.040]  on TV viewers the long simmering clash between the world's two great powers is
[03:10:01.040 --> 03:10:04.160]  coming to a head with dangerous implications I want to cover this
[03:10:04.160 --> 03:10:07.960]  first with Tarpley before the internet stuff is it all ties together because
[03:10:07.960 --> 03:10:11.400]  all these governments are getting themselves ready for war economic you
[03:10:11.400 --> 03:10:16.840]  name it is China's Politburo spoiling for a showdown with America of course
[03:10:16.840 --> 03:10:21.240]  Tarpley will say no it's the West trying to encircle China they're all a bunch of
[03:10:21.240 --> 03:10:27.240]  thugs government scum run but the point is there's no doubt that this is
[03:10:27.240 --> 03:10:31.760]  happening the long simmering clash between the world's two great powers is
[03:10:31.760 --> 03:10:34.800]  coming to a head with dangerous implications for the international
[03:10:34.800 --> 03:10:38.000]  system now the last six months this has been simmering we've been talking
[03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:42.160]  about it with our expert guest all agreeing that there's major battle lines
[03:10:42.160 --> 03:10:48.480]  at the Iran situation in Pakistan is just set pieces into China now listen to
[03:10:48.480 --> 03:10:55.760]  this article China has succumbed to hubris it has mistaken the soft
[03:10:55.760 --> 03:11:01.320]  diplomacy of Barack Obama for weakness mistaken the US credit crisis for
[03:11:01.320 --> 03:11:09.320]  decline and mistaken its own mercantilist bubble for ascendancy all
[03:11:09.320 --> 03:11:12.760]  they admit it's mercantilism how we've been deindustrialized it was our big
[03:11:12.760 --> 03:11:18.040]  banking cartels that set the deal up mercantilism by design not free trade
[03:11:18.040 --> 03:11:22.320]  to ruin all their competition there are ec I've never seen such an honest
[03:11:22.320 --> 03:11:25.520]  article by Ambrose Evans preacher but it's not honest it's twisted to say
[03:11:25.520 --> 03:11:30.920]  that it's all China but the information is someone accurate it is mistaken the
[03:11:30.920 --> 03:11:34.360]  soft diplomacy of Barack Obama for weakness mistaken the US credit crisis
[03:11:34.360 --> 03:11:39.480]  for decline and mistaken its own mercantilist bubble for ascendancy there
[03:11:39.480 --> 03:11:44.520]  are echoes of the Anglo-German spats before the First World War when Wilhelm
[03:11:44.520 --> 03:11:49.080]  Berlin so badly misjudged the strategic balance of power and overplayed its
[03:11:49.080 --> 03:11:55.720]  hand it's going to be really hard for them yet again to fudge on the obvious
[03:11:55.720 --> 03:12:00.000]  fact that China is manipulating without a credible threat we're not going to get
[03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:06.840]  anywhere said Paul Krugman this year's Nobel economist and then it continues
[03:12:06.840 --> 03:12:12.400]  China's premier win Jai Bado I'm sure I'm pronouncing that wrong is defiant I
[03:12:12.400 --> 03:12:16.160]  don't think the yon is undervalued we oppose countries pointing fingers at
[03:12:16.160 --> 03:12:20.160]  each other and even forcing a country to appreciate its currency he said
[03:12:20.160 --> 03:12:25.240]  yesterday once again he demanded the US takes concrete steps to reverse and
[03:12:25.240 --> 03:12:30.240]  reassure investors over the safety of US assets and then it goes on with them
[03:12:30.240 --> 03:12:34.080]  saying we're a police state how dare you say we're a police state in China and
[03:12:34.080 --> 03:12:37.920]  we've got Venezuela calling for internet controls that's wrong but our
[03:12:37.920 --> 03:12:41.720]  government's actually putting it in place and the article goes on and on it's a
[03:12:41.720 --> 03:12:45.600]  very chilling story but it's not just China saying the banks are looting us
[03:12:45.600 --> 03:12:50.080]  it's Bloomberg and Moody saying we basically have already really lost our
[03:12:50.080 --> 03:12:54.360]  AAA rating but it's still officially there so to talk about the geopolitical
[03:12:54.360 --> 03:12:59.400]  state of the world what we're steaming into echoes of World War one World War
[03:12:59.400 --> 03:13:04.240]  two all the pieces lining up the domestic police state clamping down ahead of the
[03:13:04.240 --> 03:13:10.160]  war what type of war is this economic military a mix Webster I mean this is an
[03:13:10.160 --> 03:13:15.040]  amazing story from the London Telegraph well Ambrose Evans Pritchard of course
[03:13:15.040 --> 03:13:20.800]  is the voice of MI6 and British intelligence and that newspaper that
[03:13:20.800 --> 03:13:25.480]  rag over there the London Daily Telegraph were of course pro Hitler all
[03:13:25.480 --> 03:13:32.440]  through the 1930s they stuck with Hitler as well as they dared so it's good that
[03:13:32.440 --> 03:13:37.240]  you remember this or recall this question about the British rivalry with
[03:13:37.240 --> 03:13:43.280]  Germany before 1914 when the British saw a rising industrial challenger and of
[03:13:43.280 --> 03:13:48.520]  course their response to it was to attempt to play Russia and France against
[03:13:48.520 --> 03:13:52.880]  Germany and the result of that is World War one and the British found themselves
[03:13:52.880 --> 03:13:58.160]  dragged into it now the current situation of Britain is that they are
[03:13:58.160 --> 03:14:04.120]  bankrupt six ways to Sunday they are more bankrupt than Greece one of the
[03:14:04.120 --> 03:14:08.720]  reasons for attacking Greece is to relieve pressure not just on the dollar but
[03:14:08.720 --> 03:14:13.600]  also on the British pound and the city of London in general and the metrics all
[03:14:13.600 --> 03:14:17.920]  show that they are much more debt per capita per citizen and the government
[03:14:17.920 --> 03:14:23.880]  than Greece and the rate of growth of British debt is also quicker so we're
[03:14:23.880 --> 03:14:27.640]  dealing now with the with the British establishment so their response to this
[03:14:27.640 --> 03:14:33.200]  kind of a crisis is to attempt to create tensions between Russia and the United
[03:14:33.200 --> 03:14:37.880]  States but also as you see to attempt to get in between the United States and
[03:14:37.880 --> 03:14:42.000]  China and attempt to make that into a crisis because the British right now is
[03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:45.480]  so desperate and I'm referring now to the ruling elite because there are other
[03:14:45.480 --> 03:14:49.480]  forces that I'd like to refer to but they're so desperate that they feel the
[03:14:49.480 --> 03:14:54.040]  only way they can hang on is by the simultaneous ruin of all the other
[03:14:54.040 --> 03:14:58.240]  contenders and everybody needs to know this right the instinct of the British
[03:14:58.240 --> 03:15:02.880]  foreign office is divide and conquer promote conflicts get everybody else at
[03:15:02.880 --> 03:15:07.800]  each other's throats right the BBC bed breakfast and conflict they deal in
[03:15:07.800 --> 03:15:12.440]  conflict and here they're trying to do it now the idea that there's a group in
[03:15:12.440 --> 03:15:17.600]  the Chinese Politburo that wants conflict is absolutely fantastic these
[03:15:17.600 --> 03:15:24.160]  people are meat bureaucrats relatively speaking who are attempting to avoid
[03:15:24.160 --> 03:15:29.080]  conflict and right now that group of bureaucrats in the Politburo is paying
[03:15:29.080 --> 03:15:35.560]  the price for their bad decisions of the last 20 years essentially opening up to
[03:15:35.560 --> 03:15:39.160]  free trade to a significant degree although they've tried to use other
[03:15:39.160 --> 03:15:43.360]  people's free trade rather than their own let's say their big crime is to pay
[03:15:43.360 --> 03:15:48.640]  lip service to free trade and above all building up this huge amount of dollar
[03:15:48.640 --> 03:15:54.400]  assets which are now a significant threat to them if they keep them they
[03:15:54.400 --> 03:15:59.920]  will dwindle if they dump them they will all crash I recommended that China
[03:15:59.920 --> 03:16:04.800]  start using that money for capital investments inside the country that's
[03:16:04.800 --> 03:16:07.800]  what they're doing but let me stop you up but I don't address off before we
[03:16:07.800 --> 03:16:13.200]  digress off into into economics and what you think China should do what is the
[03:16:13.200 --> 03:16:18.360]  larger from your perspective program why did the West invest almost everything
[03:16:18.360 --> 03:16:23.560]  in China build them up and then now double back and attack China for all the
[03:16:23.560 --> 03:16:27.480]  power they've got when the CFR and others have said this century is the
[03:16:27.480 --> 03:16:31.880]  Chinese century I mean is that I mean we know the British great game is to play
[03:16:31.880 --> 03:16:34.880]  powers off against each other and we know that they control a lot of our
[03:16:34.880 --> 03:16:38.760]  policy here and that we're joined at the hip of the Anglo-American Dutch system
[03:16:38.760 --> 03:16:43.920]  but I mean pulling away before we go off into light pebble reactors and monorail
[03:16:43.920 --> 03:16:47.160]  and I mean that's all right which is where they should go and where we should
[03:16:47.160 --> 03:16:50.840]  too that's where they're going but and we're not but the point here is the
[03:16:50.840 --> 03:16:55.440]  larger picture what was the method in the madness of moving the industrial base
[03:16:55.440 --> 03:16:58.640]  to China and now running around like chickens with their heads cut off about
[03:16:58.640 --> 03:17:02.680]  the problem with this is that the finance oligarchy of London and Wall
[03:17:02.680 --> 03:17:07.200]  Street cannot plan the world they have no plan in that they think they have a
[03:17:07.200 --> 03:17:13.960]  plan but their plan contains boomerangs unintended consequences for example the
[03:17:13.960 --> 03:17:20.280]  reason that they sent us industry to China is simple greed of this vicious
[03:17:20.280 --> 03:17:24.600]  greed that they have it's the runaway shop the logic of the runaway shop is
[03:17:24.600 --> 03:17:29.320]  you fire your workers here and you send it to China where you pay 25 cents an hour
[03:17:29.320 --> 03:17:34.480]  or whatever it is but now the problem is that after 20 years of that 30 years of
[03:17:34.480 --> 03:17:39.640]  that since the days of Deng Xiaoping China has now become a significant power
[03:17:39.640 --> 03:17:45.120]  I would stress that the power of China is actually relative it has to do with the
[03:17:45.120 --> 03:17:49.760]  industrial collapse of the United States the relative deindustrialization of the
[03:17:49.760 --> 03:17:54.560]  European Union and so forth this makes the Chinese look like a big frog you
[03:17:54.560 --> 03:17:58.440]  might say in a small pond in reality they have tremendous weaknesses they've
[03:17:58.440 --> 03:18:03.400]  got about you know one half of the country over 600 million two-thirds of
[03:18:03.400 --> 03:18:07.080]  the country perhaps are essentially poverty-stricken peasants in the
[03:18:07.080 --> 03:18:11.520]  interior feeling very very resentful about what their government is doing but
[03:18:11.520 --> 03:18:15.840]  nevertheless now the annual Americans these wonderful guys who live from hand
[03:18:15.840 --> 03:18:20.600]  to mouth and they're constantly obsessed with short-term speculative gain they
[03:18:20.600 --> 03:18:25.160]  now realize that they're confronting a serious problem with China that after
[03:18:25.160 --> 03:18:29.800]  all the era of the neocons and now the Obama bots the Chinese are getting
[03:18:29.800 --> 03:18:34.160]  thoroughly riled up especially by this this latest arrogance with Google
[03:18:34.160 --> 03:18:38.040]  Google is essentially an arm of the National Security Agency right when
[03:18:38.040 --> 03:18:42.680]  Google attacks you it's the National Security Agency it's the US intelligence
[03:18:42.680 --> 03:18:48.000]  community it is them it's the rogue network running the show there so Google
[03:18:48.000 --> 03:18:52.880]  is saying to China we refuse to obey your laws now for the Chinese this goes
[03:18:52.880 --> 03:18:55.800]  back to what are called the unequal treaties right since the British
[03:18:55.800 --> 03:19:01.280]  opium wars in 1840 to 1860 you had this stuff with treaty ports in other words
[03:19:01.280 --> 03:19:05.960]  foreigners had more rights in China than the Chinese did themselves and the
[03:19:05.960 --> 03:19:09.200]  Chinese society went through a tremendous breakdown crisis now you get
[03:19:09.200 --> 03:19:15.120]  NSA Google acting in the way of a 19th century imperialist thing we demand
[03:19:15.120 --> 03:19:19.400]  immunity from your laws we demand extraterritorial treatment how dare
[03:19:19.400 --> 03:19:23.640]  you attack us it of course the hypocrisy as we all know which is the same thing
[03:19:23.640 --> 03:19:27.880]  that the global corporations do in the West they're all above the law and and
[03:19:27.880 --> 03:19:32.360]  we're being colonized and broken up into 1012 parts just like China was these
[03:19:32.360 --> 03:19:36.120]  are corporate fiefdoms but the Chinese have the advantage of seeing this is a
[03:19:36.120 --> 03:19:40.080]  foreign attack and there's a huge nationalist movement in China which is a
[03:19:40.080 --> 03:19:43.000]  problem for the government now I know anti-new-world order stuff's really hot
[03:19:43.000 --> 03:19:47.440]  there the best-selling books are about the banking cartel the New World Order so
[03:19:47.440 --> 03:19:52.600]  are the communists turning against the people that put them in power are they
[03:19:52.600 --> 03:19:55.920]  even communists we'll be right back with Webster Tarpley we'll be right back we
[03:19:55.920 --> 03:19:59.440]  know the banks of the ultimate communists

[03:24:30.360 --> 03:24:38.040]  we have links to this document US intelligence plan to destroy wiki leaks
[03:24:38.040 --> 03:24:45.680]  and they were sent the secret N-O-F-O-R-N 32-page US counter intelligence
[03:24:45.680 --> 03:24:54.480]  manual and this is from February 2008 and they describe the internet as an
[03:24:54.480 --> 03:25:01.080]  enemy weapons platform as wiki leaks a terrorist group insurgents it says an
[03:25:01.080 --> 03:25:05.160]  online reference to foreign intelligence services insurgents or terror
[03:25:05.160 --> 03:25:12.360]  groups and this is up on wiki leaks now what is wiki leaks been releasing two
[03:25:12.360 --> 03:25:17.680]  weeks ago it came out in Utah that the Pentagon was watching US citizens in
[03:25:17.680 --> 03:25:22.760]  non-terror related cases illegal wiki leaks got documents they confirm they're
[03:25:22.760 --> 03:25:27.600]  real wiki leaks put out the White House memo the Downing Street memo that was
[03:25:27.600 --> 03:25:32.400]  released by MI6 where Bush was you know in there we got to fix the intelligence
[03:25:32.400 --> 03:25:38.280]  we got a lie about WMDs it's come out that Dick Cheney wanted to blow up US
[03:25:38.280 --> 03:25:42.320]  ships and blame it on Iran they hate this site there's a lot of others that
[03:25:42.320 --> 03:25:45.240]  are doing it as well but I noticed in New Zealand when they started banning
[03:25:45.240 --> 03:25:49.320]  sites till people scream body murder it was info wars dot com prison money dot
[03:25:49.320 --> 03:25:53.480]  com wiki leaks we don't even post these documents that's not I'm not getting into
[03:25:53.480 --> 03:26:00.600]  those waters but we support those that do if it's exposing crime and they're
[03:26:00.600 --> 03:26:05.080]  now saying that it's a weapon system here's the BBC US plans to fight the
[03:26:05.080 --> 03:26:08.640]  net revealed and they're openly saying that that they're building all these
[03:26:08.640 --> 03:26:13.200]  NSA centers to spy on everything the American people do without warrants and
[03:26:13.200 --> 03:26:17.320]  we've got cash unseen saying get rid of the free internet we have wired magazine
[03:26:17.320 --> 03:26:21.160]  headlines cyber security ends open internet Webster I think people need to
[03:26:21.160 --> 03:26:27.320]  realize this is really happening they're really preparing to censor the web why
[03:26:27.320 --> 03:26:35.480]  are of totalitarian figures like Cass Einstein to to impose what used to be
[03:26:35.480 --> 03:26:39.640]  called prior restraint in other words they would like to censor what you put
[03:26:39.640 --> 03:26:44.560]  up there before you can put it up and of course prior restraint is totally alien
[03:26:44.560 --> 03:26:49.960]  to the American tradition but the other side of it of course is cyber warfare
[03:26:49.960 --> 03:26:54.240]  and I think this is maybe worth pointing out you covered of course the CNN
[03:26:54.240 --> 03:27:01.080]  two-hour special featuring all these 9-11 heavyweights and plug-uglies a
[03:27:01.080 --> 03:27:05.400]  couple of weeks ago which was the simulation of this big attack on the
[03:27:05.400 --> 03:27:10.560]  United States coming from Russia China and Sudan that eventually shut down the
[03:27:10.560 --> 03:27:15.040]  entire electrical system I think there's a there's a group in the in the
[03:27:15.040 --> 03:27:19.600]  Pentagon and the think tanks and I'm looking especially at Yoda Andrew
[03:27:19.600 --> 03:27:23.400]  Marshall at the office of net assessment in the Pentagon the guy who
[03:27:23.400 --> 03:27:27.520]  actually controls the Pentagon defense science board from from behind the
[03:27:27.520 --> 03:27:32.560]  scenes and they're gearing up for cyber hysteria cyber warfare and I think
[03:27:32.560 --> 03:27:37.000]  they have four things in mind the first is total exaggeration of what can be
[03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:41.320]  done right they say oh a telephone virus can shut down the telephone system
[03:27:41.320 --> 03:27:44.640]  you can shut down the airports you can shut down the trains you can shut down
[03:27:44.640 --> 03:27:49.360]  the power systems as far as I can see this is baloney malarkey it has never
[03:27:49.360 --> 03:27:54.080]  been done and the sources for the idea that it could be done are the CIA on one
[03:27:54.080 --> 03:27:57.920]  side and the Wall Street Journal on the other so the worst of the rogue network
[03:27:57.920 --> 03:28:01.560]  and the worst of the world of the Wall Street gang so I think people have got
[03:28:01.560 --> 03:28:06.240]  to realize this idea that you can you know sabotage a nuclear reactor from a
[03:28:06.240 --> 03:28:10.680]  far with a with a virus through a computer is probably in the same league
[03:28:10.680 --> 03:28:15.200]  with Saddam's weapons of mass destruction or Tony Blair saying Iraq can
[03:28:15.200 --> 03:28:19.960]  strike London within 45 minutes we remember all of this fantastic stuff the
[03:28:19.960 --> 03:28:23.840]  other thing they try to do is to take the language of the Cold War and the
[03:28:23.840 --> 03:28:28.200]  language of nuclear confrontation and translate that into this new cyber
[03:28:28.200 --> 03:28:34.200]  jargon right of the computer age remember deterrence retaliation first
[03:28:34.200 --> 03:28:38.160]  strike second strike counter value counter force all this stuff they now
[03:28:38.160 --> 03:28:42.600]  translate that into computer talk so that you can think about this right and
[03:28:42.600 --> 03:28:46.080]  if they're attempting to educate the public in the idea that this is
[03:28:46.080 --> 03:28:50.200]  possible which I again I think it's actually not and again why would
[03:28:50.200 --> 03:28:55.440]  regional power grids be hooked to the internet why would nuclear reactors be
[03:28:55.440 --> 03:28:59.040]  hooked to the internet I mean obviously it's made up it's exaggerated that's
[03:28:59.040 --> 03:29:02.600]  admitted for anyone that knows any basics of computers my IT guys say this is a
[03:29:02.600 --> 03:29:07.080]  complete joke right but but but why would they and clearly they're gearing up to
[03:29:07.080 --> 03:29:11.320]  launch a false flag against themselves right as they're trying to pass the
[03:29:11.320 --> 03:29:16.640]  cyber security takeover in the Senate I would actually call this virtual flag
[03:29:16.640 --> 03:29:20.200]  terrorism this is the expression that I've tried to coin virtual flag

[03:35:01.200 --> 03:35:05.080]  it's wall street journal it's wired magazine we've got the bill we've got
[03:35:05.080 --> 03:35:08.840]  the White House saying they want to censor the internet attack US websites
[03:35:08.840 --> 03:35:14.120]  censor people force everybody on to a new internet to where according to the
[03:35:14.120 --> 03:35:17.440]  new rules it's a private corporate system that the government pays for
[03:35:17.440 --> 03:35:20.720]  with tax money and they say oh you can have the old internet that doesn't work
[03:35:20.720 --> 03:35:25.240]  anymore but if you're on the new web well you there's all these rules you've
[03:35:25.240 --> 03:35:31.480]  got to have a sub website on a larger domain continuing clearly I've been
[03:35:31.480 --> 03:35:34.280]  saying I believe there's going to be a virtual flag attack I've called it a
[03:35:34.280 --> 03:35:39.400]  fake false flag internet attack great term you've coined a virtual flag attack
[03:35:39.400 --> 03:35:46.360]  and it looks like they're really again going hard and heavy with the pre
[03:35:46.360 --> 03:35:51.360]  conditioning that they're the good guys it's gonna come they've got to take all
[03:35:51.360 --> 03:35:55.480]  your rights everybody who has a website's got to be certified anybody in
[03:35:55.480 --> 03:35:59.960]  IT's got to be certified it talks about youth cores in high school and college
[03:35:59.960 --> 03:36:04.200]  recruiting them to just have hundreds of thousands working for the feds I mean
[03:36:04.200 --> 03:36:07.520]  this is declaring war on the internet we've been saying that for years but
[03:36:07.520 --> 03:36:12.960]  here's the BBC US plans to fight the net revealed Webster Tarpley bottom line
[03:36:12.960 --> 03:36:17.400]  where's this going well if you notice the cast of characters the cast of
[03:36:17.400 --> 03:36:21.760]  enemies and targets that come with this whole new thing is that different in
[03:36:21.760 --> 03:36:26.180]  that CNN special somebody at some point brings up the question is this bin
[03:36:26.180 --> 03:36:29.960]  Laden is this al-Qaeda and they practically laugh him out of the room
[03:36:29.960 --> 03:36:35.160]  they they respond with with brusque dismissal even scorn right how could
[03:36:35.160 --> 03:36:38.840]  they do that that's a bunch of guys who live in caves right according according
[03:36:38.840 --> 03:36:41.960]  to the well-known myth well of course that was always the problem with the
[03:36:41.960 --> 03:36:48.400]  the 9-11 story but now it's different it's China Russia Sudan of the three
[03:36:48.400 --> 03:36:54.320]  that are mentioned city of Irkutsk in Siberia is supposedly the source of this
[03:36:54.320 --> 03:36:59.880]  terrible virus that shuts down the US electrical system and the virus in
[03:36:59.880 --> 03:37:05.960]  the cell phones comes from from cartoon in Sudan China so we've got to take your
[03:37:05.960 --> 03:37:10.440]  web freedom to save you from shadowy russkies right but they also they're
[03:37:10.440 --> 03:37:15.720]  looking for for a conflict in other words it's an area of confrontation which
[03:37:15.720 --> 03:37:19.240]  they think they can they can do in other words with nuclear war of course it's
[03:37:19.240 --> 03:37:23.320]  unthinkable you can get your head blown off but the I think the idea is
[03:37:23.320 --> 03:37:27.840]  spreading at Booz Allen Hamilton and the national security agency and in this
[03:37:27.840 --> 03:37:33.320]  defense science board in the office of net assessment of Yoda in the Pentagon
[03:37:33.320 --> 03:37:36.760]  this is something you can do it's not unthinkable it's going on all the time
[03:37:36.760 --> 03:37:41.320]  and you can blame anybody you want like Google blames China where's the proof
[03:37:41.320 --> 03:37:46.400]  there is no proof China denies it so who how do we know so you can have you can
[03:37:46.400 --> 03:37:51.240]  essentially attack yourself you can shut down your own nuclear reactor or
[03:37:51.240 --> 03:37:55.680]  airport and then say oh that was left out that was Beijing and again Bush's
[03:37:55.680 --> 03:37:59.800]  cyber security bill two years ago that Obama's ramming through headline should
[03:37:59.800 --> 03:38:04.800]  Obama control the net mother Jones it's designed for them to shut the web off
[03:38:04.800 --> 03:38:09.400]  and they're saying we may have to shut the Internet down to save you right at
[03:38:09.400 --> 03:38:13.680]  the time when the Internet is fully unmasking the bankers right and Obama
[03:38:13.680 --> 03:38:18.000]  started Obama personally kicked this off last May with the speech where he
[03:38:18.000 --> 03:38:23.640]  said I haven't revealed this yet but my own websites my campaign websites were
[03:38:23.640 --> 03:38:28.040]  attacked by hackers during the election campaign and I had to go to the CIA the
[03:38:28.040 --> 03:38:33.480]  FBI and the NSA so in a certain sense you can say the Obama websites right all
[03:38:33.480 --> 03:38:38.640]  of those famous websites that he has and still has that these are essentially
[03:38:38.640 --> 03:38:42.520]  under the aegis of the national security agency and some of these
[03:38:42.520 --> 03:38:46.880]  consultants so it's a it's an absolute mess and people need to fight back you
[03:38:46.880 --> 03:38:50.760]  have to remember the first amendment leaves through us the first amendment
[03:38:50.760 --> 03:38:55.360]  use it or lose it so use your rights before somebody comes and takes it away
[03:38:55.360 --> 03:39:00.600]  I would say more broadly the impetus towards police states and dictatorships
[03:39:00.600 --> 03:39:05.400]  comes from the economic realm in other words it's the economic breakdown crisis
[03:39:05.400 --> 03:39:10.440]  that allows governments to think that they can that they can take people's
[03:39:10.440 --> 03:39:15.160]  rights away and I think Webster that's my next issue I want to get into you get
[03:39:15.160 --> 03:39:19.720]  in with you before we leave I want to have you cover that before the show's
[03:39:19.720 --> 03:39:24.480]  over here but I want to go to some calls now because I always forget and never go
[03:39:24.480 --> 03:39:29.880]  to them so we're gonna take five calls quickly and then we're gonna look at the
[03:39:29.880 --> 03:39:35.800]  economic realm everything you talked about now coming true in spades US UK
[03:39:35.800 --> 03:39:42.240]  move closer to losing rating Moody's says Bloomberg now what does that mean
[03:39:42.240 --> 03:39:47.240]  for a lay person out there what does the death of the dollar mean but the
[03:39:47.240 --> 03:39:52.600]  lobalists are saying they're gonna have a coordinated g20 g24 there's really 24
[03:39:52.600 --> 03:39:58.480]  members of these meetings devaluation of currencies simultaneously or there's
[03:39:58.480 --> 03:40:01.240]  some debate about picking them off one at a time so that's coming up before
[03:40:01.240 --> 03:40:05.080]  Webster leaves us but now phone calls quickly before we cover the most
[03:40:05.080 --> 03:40:10.560]  important subject the economy and this economic warfare government oven for the
[03:40:10.560 --> 03:40:14.600]  banking cartel Jacob in Tennessee you're on the air with Webster Tarpley go ahead
[03:40:14.600 --> 03:40:19.360]  afternoon gentlemen my question has to do specifically with the current status
[03:40:19.360 --> 03:40:24.480]  of the dollar bill we were informed by a legend moles of the Bilderberg group back
[03:40:24.480 --> 03:40:31.160]  in the way that they were not going to drop a dollar until the GDP and the
[03:40:31.160 --> 03:40:37.520]  economy rose to the same levels of a decade prior we know now that we're
[03:40:37.520 --> 03:40:46.040]  well above that we're well 2% over where we were a decade ago excuse me now do
[03:40:46.040 --> 03:40:50.480]  you believe that they're just to their own horn or are they waiting for more
[03:40:50.480 --> 03:40:56.080]  people to try and invest and waste their money okay so this question goes to the
[03:40:56.080 --> 03:41:02.600]  bigger issue Webster bottom line what is their plan we see about a new global
[03:41:02.600 --> 03:41:06.560]  Constitution of the banks they're going to save us from the crisis they've
[03:41:06.560 --> 03:41:12.480]  created now MSNBC saying double dip recession double dip housing market
[03:41:12.480 --> 03:41:17.360]  that the banks need more money more power to save us what's actually going on
[03:41:17.360 --> 03:41:22.280]  is this attack on the euro in other words people they don't seem to be giving
[03:41:22.280 --> 03:41:26.160]  up on the dollar in the sense that this this Bilderberg plan whatever this was
[03:41:26.160 --> 03:41:32.000]  might might suggest what you see is Soros Goldman Sachs Bank of America the
[03:41:32.000 --> 03:41:37.280]  market in other words the main finance oligarchs of Wall Street attacking the
[03:41:37.280 --> 03:41:42.760]  euro by means of Greece the Greek government bonds by means of Spain
[03:41:42.760 --> 03:41:48.240]  Portugal Ireland ultimately Italy and this is an attack really on Germany
[03:41:48.240 --> 03:41:52.440]  which is the heart of the European Union so the reason they're doing that of
[03:41:52.440 --> 03:41:56.320]  course is they've got a situation where they can make it look like the euro is
[03:41:56.320 --> 03:42:01.440]  collapsing faster than the dollar in this general context of a world
[03:42:01.440 --> 03:42:06.640]  economic depression of unimaginable proportions in a bottomless crisis so
[03:42:06.640 --> 03:42:10.440]  they don't seem to give up and in the meantime they're making money by
[03:42:10.440 --> 03:42:14.960]  speculating against the euro and they're attempting again to prop up the
[03:42:14.960 --> 03:42:19.840]  dollar and prop up the pound because the pound is also just the sickest
[03:42:19.840 --> 03:42:25.800]  currency in Europe now there is a backlash against some of this stuff and
[03:42:25.800 --> 03:42:30.560]  you have people inside the European Union who were saying ban hedge funds and
[03:42:30.560 --> 03:42:37.040]  also an a very interesting move ban credit default swaps ban the most toxic
[03:42:37.040 --> 03:42:41.160]  kind of derivative the kind of thing that cost the American taxpayer two
[03:42:41.160 --> 03:42:45.080]  hundred billion dollars with AIG and ultimately is the root of the entire
[03:42:45.080 --> 03:42:49.800]  crisis is derivatives and specifically the most explosive kind credit default
[03:42:49.800 --> 03:42:54.360]  swap so there are some people who are trying to go from from economic self
[03:42:54.360 --> 03:42:58.560]  defense and that will take a protectionist or mercantilist form
[03:42:58.560 --> 03:43:03.200]  compared to the free trade which has been practiced so far the fact is we're
[03:43:03.200 --> 03:43:06.760]  in a depression it's getting worse the second round of the depression the
[03:43:06.760 --> 03:43:10.920]  second wave of the depression I think is likely to arrive this year and that's
[03:43:10.920 --> 03:43:15.560]  gonna have to do with these sovereign bankruptcies right that that certain
[03:43:15.560 --> 03:43:19.520]  countries can be driven into into bankruptcy but remember who's doing
[03:43:19.520 --> 03:43:25.440]  this soros hedge funds and banks in other words it's the situation where the
[03:43:25.440 --> 03:43:29.760]  financial community has declared war on the nation's state and I think the
[03:43:29.760 --> 03:43:34.840]  nation state is a better deal than the than the hedge funds and the bankers
[03:43:34.840 --> 03:43:41.000]  so I would say it's better for the nation state to put JP Morgan Goldman Sachs
[03:43:41.000 --> 03:43:44.640]  into bankruptcy than to let them bankrupt the US government because that's
[03:43:44.640 --> 03:43:50.880]  what it that's what it comes down to absolutely let's take another call here
[03:43:50.880 --> 03:43:57.640]  let's talk to Rocco in North Carolina you're on the air hey two questions when
[03:43:57.640 --> 03:44:02.640]  we talk about China my impression was that China was under the complete
[03:44:02.640 --> 03:44:07.140]  control direct control in New World Order that's why they had a security
[03:44:07.140 --> 03:44:13.200]  council wrong I think this is always an illusion the idea that Russia and China
[03:44:13.200 --> 03:44:16.880]  are integral parts of something called the New World Order I think is is
[03:44:16.880 --> 03:44:22.040]  simply wrong it it comes from I think from not knowing much about these
[03:44:22.040 --> 03:44:25.000]  countries well let me stop you for a minute Webster I want to hear what you
[03:44:25.000 --> 03:44:29.680]  have to say on this but let me be clear the West the British and others
[03:44:29.680 --> 03:44:34.200]  clearly it's part of the historical record funded a lot of the Bolsheviks
[03:44:34.200 --> 03:44:39.600]  then once Lenin got out of there Stalin ran Trotsky out so the West turned
[03:44:39.600 --> 03:44:44.480]  against him we know Putin did arrest a bunch of the oligarchs when he was
[03:44:44.480 --> 03:44:48.280]  vice president and then president and it was all over the news that Rothschilds
[03:44:48.280 --> 03:44:51.280]  and Rockefellers were the real owners that came out like the times of London
[03:44:51.280 --> 03:44:58.120]  and and we know China did sign deals with the US in the 70s to set up the
[03:44:58.120 --> 03:45:02.520]  eugenics one-child policy and all this so we know they did deals with them but
[03:45:02.520 --> 03:45:06.080]  still in any mafia situation you're gonna have different families in the system
[03:45:06.080 --> 03:45:10.240]  fighting with each other we've had Russia and China call for their own New
[03:45:10.240 --> 03:45:14.080]  World Order and I'm sure if they were in the position of the British they would
[03:45:14.080 --> 03:45:18.080]  have tried some of the same systems so so there's certainly collusion at points
[03:45:18.080 --> 03:45:22.800]  but it's like a group of pirate ships in Armada out robbing people you are
[03:45:22.800 --> 03:45:27.160]  gonna have different historical shifts and changes but no this whole system
[03:45:27.160 --> 03:45:32.920]  isn't one monolith but the management system of the technocracy is the same
[03:45:32.920 --> 03:45:38.960]  art form you go through phases you can say in the 1990s when you had Yeltsin in
[03:45:38.960 --> 03:45:45.080]  Moscow here's a US puppet when you had Jiang Zemin in Beijing this is somebody
[03:45:45.080 --> 03:45:49.040]  who wants globalization he wants to work with the US and the British now you have
[03:45:49.040 --> 03:45:55.200]  Putin I think behind the scenes still who is a Russian nationalist who says no
[03:45:55.200 --> 03:45:59.560]  we are not the colony and the plantation of the US and the British and you've
[03:45:59.560 --> 03:46:03.400]  got this youth league faction in China well let me stop you again that's key
[03:46:03.400 --> 03:46:07.600]  because Putin's got a lot of problems and in Russia does all sorts of you know
[03:46:07.600 --> 03:46:11.640]  serious things I don't agree with but the Russian government pays people to
[03:46:11.640 --> 03:46:16.000]  have children because their population is dying it's the only Western country
[03:46:16.000 --> 03:46:20.880]  trying to reverse the death of the West so it's clear that Russia is breaking
[03:46:20.880 --> 03:46:25.520]  with the eugenicist yes and and of course the question is there are there
[03:46:25.520 --> 03:46:29.040]  are factions there's a pro-british faction there's a monetarist faction
[03:46:29.040 --> 03:46:34.400]  inside Russia and similarly in China the Shanghai mafia the Jiang Zemin faction
[03:46:34.400 --> 03:46:39.240]  thinks they're going to take over the presidency with this guy he that's X
[03:46:39.240 --> 03:46:43.440]  I right that's the guy who's supposed to be the next president of China in about
[03:46:43.440 --> 03:46:49.280]  two years from this autumn so you got to look concretely empirically about what
[03:46:49.280 --> 03:46:53.920]  the controls are so I would say right now the Shanghai cooperation organization
[03:46:53.920 --> 03:46:57.840]  powers Russia and China are in greater conflict with the US and the British
[03:46:57.840 --> 03:47:03.200]  certainly than they were ten years ago so the Russian Chinese so the Russian
[03:47:03.200 --> 03:47:08.880]  Chinese split is baloney well again you've got the British in there and
[03:47:08.880 --> 03:47:12.480]  and of course the US and the CIA are trying to do everything they can to
[03:47:12.480 --> 03:47:16.480]  divide and conquer and that's the first place right that's the dream
[03:47:16.480 --> 03:47:20.600]  scenario for Brzezinski is that you could have a war between Russia and China
[03:47:20.600 --> 03:47:25.280]  that would be the acme of of Brzezinski's achievement and that's very
[03:47:25.280 --> 03:47:29.680]  very widely shared right you can look at a report from the office of net
[03:47:29.680 --> 03:47:34.040]  assessment in the Pentagon through the Hudson Institute which talks about the
[03:47:34.040 --> 03:47:39.320]  great Siberian war of the year 2030 which is precisely that Russia against
[03:47:39.320 --> 03:47:44.320]  China so there's a whole crew of cooks in the Pentagon and the foreign office who
[03:47:44.320 --> 03:47:48.680]  think that that's possible but I would I would warn people the idea that there's
[03:47:48.680 --> 03:47:54.120]  an integral sort of seamless integration of Russia and China into the US
[03:47:54.120 --> 03:48:00.360]  British banking system is wrong you're saying that's more of a long-term
[03:48:00.360 --> 03:48:06.600]  integration fantasy of Brzezinski and Kissinger but certainly China has
[03:48:06.600 --> 03:48:14.520]  adopted the centralization of the UN and the whole eugenical system Russia more
[03:48:14.520 --> 03:48:21.000]  than China has been rebuking and exposing global warming as a fraud if you
[03:48:21.000 --> 03:48:25.400]  look at the Copenhagen conference the resistance against global warming was
[03:48:25.400 --> 03:48:30.720]  led by Premier Wen now he did it in a typical Chinese way he did it in this
[03:48:30.720 --> 03:48:36.960]  indirect you could call it an inscrutable strategy but using Sudan and
[03:48:36.960 --> 03:48:41.160]  using some third-world countries it was essentially in Copenhagen it was
[03:48:41.160 --> 03:48:46.200]  Obama against Wen to see if they could impose this carbon dictatorship and the
[03:48:46.200 --> 03:48:50.600]  answer was no in other words Wen came out on top the Prime Minister of China
[03:48:50.600 --> 03:48:55.920]  vanquished Obama and he did a service to the world so they are not included in
[03:48:55.920 --> 03:49:00.360]  this planning unfortunately they pay lip service to a lot of these things the
[03:49:00.360 --> 03:49:04.000]  Chinese pay lip service to free trade even though they don't practice it they
[03:49:04.000 --> 03:49:10.080]  have good sense they pay lip service to this carbon global warming stuff they're
[03:49:10.080 --> 03:49:15.600]  not in a in a strong ideological position but let's move on let's move on to
[03:49:15.600 --> 03:49:22.800]  some more calls good points Webster Adam in Canada you're on the air yeah hello
[03:49:22.800 --> 03:49:28.040]  yeah come on you're on the air worldwide sir yeah I just wondered if what
[03:49:28.040 --> 03:49:31.920]  we have to say about state banks like the one in North Dakota and initiatives
[03:49:31.920 --> 03:49:36.960]  right now to establish them in Oregon for months and especially in Florida where
[03:49:36.960 --> 03:49:42.000]  Dr. Farid Kabari has its idea of a zero-cost economy yeah that's a good
[03:49:42.000 --> 03:49:45.920]  idea I've seen with state banks some real state banks set up in the last
[03:49:45.920 --> 03:49:50.400]  hundred years they give people really low-cost credit and aren't part of the
[03:49:50.400 --> 03:49:54.480]  private banking cartel Webster look at the state bank is a fine thing but it's
[03:49:54.480 --> 03:49:59.800]  a little thing it's a marginal difference North Dakota I guess has low
[03:49:59.800 --> 03:50:03.400]  unemployment because if you're unemployed in North Dakota you leave then
[03:50:03.400 --> 03:50:07.200]  there are very few people left in North Dakota so North Dakota is a very bad
[03:50:07.200 --> 03:50:10.920]  example but on the other hand it's fine if you're gonna do this along the way
[03:50:10.920 --> 03:50:15.080]  but don't think this is gonna cause an economic recovery much better in my view
[03:50:15.080 --> 03:50:19.720]  and right now the subject of a big world movement is the Tobin tax it's called the
[03:50:19.720 --> 03:50:24.600]  Robin Hood tax now in Britain in the Labor Party and the trade union there
[03:50:24.600 --> 03:50:27.960]  are a bunch of people who realize that they are doomed unless they get some
[03:50:27.960 --> 03:50:33.360]  less populist cover Webster we gotta go to break but I gotta say this Webster the
[03:50:33.360 --> 03:50:38.600]  UN's been pushing the Tobin tanks the bigger credit hold on
[03:50:38.600 --> 03:50:44.400]  which kind the Tobin tax of the UN and Sarkozy is let's have a tax globally
[03:50:44.400 --> 03:50:48.680]  run by the UN and the money goes to the International Monetary Fund obviously
[03:50:48.680 --> 03:50:52.880]  not but inside Europe you've got people going with the Robin Hood tax the
[03:50:52.880 --> 03:50:55.840]  financial transaction that's what I was about to say okay stay there we're gonna
[03:50:55.840 --> 03:50:59.960]  come back after the break the Webster Griffin tarblings we cover a wide range

[03:54:05.920 --> 03:54:12.480]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network I've been
[03:54:12.480 --> 03:54:16.480]  listening to Bloomberg radio and watching CNBC they go oh there's calls for
[03:54:16.480 --> 03:54:22.720]  attacks on banks what it is is attacks on all banks that's then passed on to
[03:54:22.720 --> 03:54:29.840]  customers no you have a tax on Goldman Sachs others the top predatory class how
[03:54:29.840 --> 03:54:33.720]  about we just remove the fellow reserve give it back to Congress how about we
[03:54:33.720 --> 03:54:40.920]  slash taxes that increases the receipts that come in the tax money the system
[03:54:40.920 --> 03:54:47.680]  knows this Kennedy cut taxes by 50% and guess what happened tax money coming in
[03:54:47.680 --> 03:54:51.520]  doubled the banks don't want that they want stagnation they want austerity they
[03:54:51.520 --> 03:54:56.520]  want you bankrupt they want the land they want the companies they openly have
[03:54:56.520 --> 03:55:01.200]  financed the phony green revolution to destroy our industrialized society it's
[03:55:01.200 --> 03:55:07.160]  the fake banking parasite system waging war on the real economy and Main Street
[03:55:07.160 --> 03:55:12.360]  so Webster you're saying have nationalist taxes on the banks the
[03:55:12.360 --> 03:55:15.480]  problem is if you don't remove them as criminals they'll just engage in
[03:55:15.480 --> 03:55:22.560]  economic terrorism I say tax Goldman Sachs slap a tax on Goldman Sachs call it
[03:55:22.560 --> 03:55:27.680]  a Tobin tax the Wall Street sales tax securities transfer tax telling sales
[03:55:27.680 --> 03:55:32.360]  tax on them whatever you want to call it if you're in California or New York or
[03:55:32.360 --> 03:55:37.480]  Illinois or New Jersey or Virginia you got to advocate a state-level Wall Street
[03:55:37.480 --> 03:55:41.840]  sales tax for example if you if California doesn't do this they're
[03:55:41.840 --> 03:55:46.360]  going to be bankrupt this year and Goldman Sachs will be attacking them and
[03:55:46.360 --> 03:55:51.440]  Soros and all of those hedge funds so the only question now is will you tax
[03:55:51.440 --> 03:55:57.320]  Goldman and JP Morgan and it's on their speculative turnover it's not on banks
[03:55:57.320 --> 03:56:02.400]  per se it's on speculative turnover mainly derivatives no I know I was talking
[03:56:02.400 --> 03:56:06.320]  about their proposing a tax that the government grabs that they then give
[03:56:06.320 --> 03:56:09.800]  themselves and I totally agree with you we've got to bring them to justice
[03:56:09.800 --> 03:56:13.960]  there's going to be a tax on financial turnover it's the only flow of money in
[03:56:13.960 --> 03:56:19.120]  the world it's not taxed people pay between six and eleven percent on shoes
[03:56:19.120 --> 03:56:24.080]  for their kid but the bankers they do flash trading thousands of times a
[03:56:24.080 --> 03:56:29.520]  second they pay zero and now all these days you know they want to pack and now
[03:56:29.520 --> 03:56:34.880]  all the states are starting to pass law sales taxes on food and we can't have
[03:56:34.880 --> 03:56:38.640]  milk that's awful that's regressive taxation this is what you cannot have
[03:56:38.640 --> 03:56:42.680]  anyway you have to break the power of Wall Street somehow and here's what it's
[03:56:42.680 --> 03:56:46.240]  going to be everybody thought the British Labor Party under Gordon Brown was
[03:56:46.240 --> 03:56:51.040]  dead right new labor now you've got this bunch of people the labor left in
[03:56:51.040 --> 03:56:56.560]  effect is going for the Robin Hood tax if the conservatives the Tories in
[03:56:56.560 --> 03:57:00.480]  Britain are going to get defeated in an election that's going to be held now in
[03:57:00.480 --> 03:57:05.160]  four six eight weeks at the most this spring then that will kick over into the
[03:57:05.160 --> 03:57:10.080]  United States and all the desperate Democrats and other desperadoes will
[03:57:10.080 --> 03:57:13.680]  say all right I got to get some popular street creds I'm going to go with the
[03:57:13.680 --> 03:57:18.160]  tax the banks Tobin tax and that will bring the issue into the United States
[03:57:18.160 --> 03:57:22.160]  see they have what we don't have they have organization they have the trade
[03:57:22.160 --> 03:57:26.440]  union Congress right the Germans have the the DGB trade unions we don't have
[03:57:26.440 --> 03:57:29.840]  any of that we're completely atomized so the only way this kind of thing could
[03:57:29.840 --> 03:57:34.560]  come into the US is basically from abroad and Britain is the best place
[03:57:34.560 --> 03:57:38.200]  for this to start so everybody is over there the Archbishop of Canterbury is
[03:57:38.200 --> 03:57:43.000]  for it the Guardian is for it the unions are for it and these this group of
[03:57:43.000 --> 03:57:48.080]  people in labor but also the liberal Democrats this third party and there was
[03:57:48.080 --> 03:57:53.080]  selected conservatives but Webster here's the reason they're for it we we
[03:57:53.080 --> 03:57:55.880]  don't need to call it a Tobin tax because they're gonna end up with the
[03:57:55.880 --> 03:58:00.120]  global and regional Tobin tax bait and switch they'll have the banks come out
[03:58:00.120 --> 03:58:03.840]  and say they're not for it when they're for it we won't get a national tax on
[03:58:03.840 --> 03:58:07.320]  we'll get their global system so we've got to watch out for that happening I
[03:58:07.320 --> 03:58:10.560]  wonder if people take a look take a look at the article on my website
[03:58:10.560 --> 03:58:15.920]  tarply.net and then take a look at this Robin Hood tax it's a British actor
[03:58:15.920 --> 03:58:20.120]  Bill Nye and they have a dramatization of this this fat cat in the city of
[03:58:20.120 --> 03:58:24.120]  London who has to admit that there's no reason why Webster we're out of time the
