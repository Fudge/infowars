[00:00.000 --> 00:27.680]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on the Sunday, March 26, 2017.
[00:27.680 --> 00:28.680]  I'm David Knight.
[00:28.680 --> 00:34.120]  We're going to have Alex Jones joining us in the next segment, and of course we saw
[00:34.120 --> 00:39.280]  the move against Obamacare, what Paul Ryan had put up, what Donald Trump had supported
[00:39.280 --> 00:40.280]  and tried to push through.
[00:40.280 --> 00:44.080]  We saw that go down in flames on Friday as they pulled that the last minute.
[00:44.080 --> 00:47.000]  There's a lot of finger pointing, there's a lot of blame going around.
[00:47.000 --> 00:49.840]  I want to point out who the enemies remain.
[00:49.840 --> 00:53.600]  We look at these stories that were on the Dredge Report today about John McCain and what
[00:53.600 --> 00:55.320]  he is saying in Europe right now.
[00:55.320 --> 00:58.720]  You have to understand who the real opposition to our interests is.
[00:58.720 --> 01:03.360]  We need to stop this civil war that is going on within the Republican Party.
[01:03.360 --> 01:08.760]  We need to understand that John McCain was in the EU this weekend saying things like
[01:08.760 --> 01:13.920]  the New World Order is under enormous strain, the Titanic struggle with the forces of radicalism,
[01:13.920 --> 01:17.920]  so forth and so on, that the EU and the US need more connectivity.
[01:17.920 --> 01:22.600]  He says, I trust the EU, and he doesn't trust Donald Trump, he doesn't trust our Constitution,
[01:22.600 --> 01:24.000]  he doesn't trust our government.
[01:24.000 --> 01:29.080]  He trusts the EU, and he says the EU and NATO were the two best sums in history.
[01:29.080 --> 01:33.200]  Yeah, the EU's got too many bureaucrats, he said, but not much bureaucracy.
[01:33.200 --> 01:34.720]  I don't know what he means by that.
[01:34.720 --> 01:38.920]  Maybe he meant to say that it doesn't have much bureaucracy.
[01:38.920 --> 01:39.920]  I don't know.
[01:39.920 --> 01:43.320]  I mean, the guy, as Rand Paul said, he's out there.
[01:43.320 --> 01:45.560]  He's an argument for term limits.
[01:45.560 --> 01:48.720]  He's a very dangerous individual, however.
[01:48.720 --> 01:51.520]  He remains a very bitter old man.
[01:51.520 --> 01:55.800]  He talks about, even when he says, yeah, okay, we'd like to see European countries contribute
[01:55.800 --> 01:57.480]  some money to their defense.
[01:57.480 --> 02:01.520]  But then he says, hey, they had contributed a thousand lives to our wars in Afghanistan
[02:01.520 --> 02:02.680]  and Iraq.
[02:02.680 --> 02:05.080]  Ask their mothers if they think that was a big contribution.
[02:05.080 --> 02:10.160]  I would say ask their mothers if they think they got what they wanted from their son's
[02:10.160 --> 02:13.360]  lives and their daughter's lives.
[02:13.360 --> 02:14.600]  Was that worth it?
[02:14.600 --> 02:20.680]  Were John McCain's wars worth it for you, all of you in Europe, all of you in America?
[02:20.680 --> 02:22.200]  What have we gained in Iraq?
[02:22.200 --> 02:28.600]  What have we gained by using al-Qaeda and ISIS as surrogates to set the Middle East
[02:28.600 --> 02:32.280]  on fire, from Libya to Syria and Iraq?
[02:32.280 --> 02:35.280]  We haven't gained anything with these wars.
[02:35.280 --> 02:38.180]  And we need to understand that as we move forward.
[02:38.180 --> 02:42.760]  This is the true enemy of America, of the European Union.
[02:42.760 --> 02:45.640]  And then he complains, I've yet to meet President Trump since he took office.
[02:45.640 --> 02:48.160]  But he has met with ISIS.
[02:48.160 --> 02:52.440]  He has met with the people that he has organized, that he's funded, that he's trained.
[02:52.440 --> 02:57.640]  He is really truly the head of the dark government, meeting with the Europeans and the European
[02:57.640 --> 02:58.640]  Union.
[02:58.640 --> 03:04.160]  I would say, just meeting with the EU bureaucracy, and of course we have the EU chief saying,
[03:04.160 --> 03:10.200]  and as it's reported in the Daily Express, they refer to Juncker as the globalist gangster
[03:10.200 --> 03:11.200]  Juncker.
[03:11.200 --> 03:14.320]  They say that he threatens Trump with war if the European Union collapses.
[03:14.320 --> 03:19.840]  They says, he reportedly said, if the European Union collapses, you will have a new war in
[03:19.840 --> 03:20.840]  the Western Balkans.
[03:20.840 --> 03:22.840]  That's a quote from the Daily Express.
[03:22.840 --> 03:27.120]  Meanwhile, China will become the darlings of the globalists.
[03:27.120 --> 03:31.720]  We have the Chinese vice premier telling a gathering of Asian leaders of the world miscommit
[03:31.720 --> 03:38.520]  to multilateral, remember, this is the difference, all the difference in the world folks, multilateral
[03:38.520 --> 03:39.520]  versus bilateral.
[03:39.520 --> 03:41.640]  So we're not isolationists.
[03:41.640 --> 03:44.700]  Donald Trump has pointed out over and over again, what he wants to have is bilateral
[03:44.700 --> 03:47.560]  trade agreements, one-on-one with other nations.
[03:47.560 --> 03:54.320]  What we do not want to have is some supranational organization that is created when you start
[03:54.320 --> 03:56.960]  to pursue multilateral free trade agreements.
[03:56.960 --> 04:01.360]  First of all, they're very difficult to do, and what you wind up doing is appointing some
[04:01.360 --> 04:04.000]  central committee to dictate terms to everyone else.
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.840]  That was what TPP did, and I think Donald Trump is absolutely right to throw that out
[04:08.840 --> 04:09.840]  at the very beginning.
[04:09.840 --> 04:12.120]  I wish he had done that with healthcare.
[04:12.120 --> 04:16.760]  I wish they had used all their powers instead of trying to work with the GOP establishment,
[04:16.760 --> 04:24.080]  Paul Ryan, the people that we know have been there for seven, eight years working against
[04:24.080 --> 04:26.360]  repealing Obamacare.
[04:26.360 --> 04:29.440]  Paul Ryan has been on the other side.
[04:29.440 --> 04:31.920]  He does not want to see this thing repeal.
[04:31.920 --> 04:34.320]  And so when you work with him, you've got to understand it's not going to happen.
[04:34.320 --> 04:38.320]  But when we saw TPP, it wasn't, Donald Trump didn't come in and say, we're going to renegotiate
[04:38.320 --> 04:39.520]  these details of TPP.
[04:39.520 --> 04:45.920]  He said, no, we're not going to have a system, a multilateral system that is going to exercise
[04:45.920 --> 04:46.920]  sovereignty over us.
[04:46.920 --> 04:50.440]  Well, we don't want sovereignty exercised over us in Obamacare.
[04:50.440 --> 04:51.440]  That's the problem.
[04:51.440 --> 04:52.440]  Stay with us.
[04:52.440 --> 04:53.440]  Be right back with Alex Jones.
[04:53.440 --> 05:10.480]  It's like lightning in a bottle, we all have days in which we just can't seem to perform
[05:10.480 --> 05:15.480]  at the level we'd like to.
[05:15.480 --> 05:21.200]  Propor vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[05:21.200 --> 05:25.480]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day
[05:25.480 --> 05:27.160]  with our modern diets.
[05:27.160 --> 05:33.000]  Seeker 12xInfoWarsLife is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support
[05:33.000 --> 05:34.760]  your body's natural systems.
[05:34.760 --> 05:39.760]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[05:39.760 --> 05:43.560]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding
[05:43.560 --> 05:48.440]  in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[05:48.440 --> 05:52.040]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[05:55.960 --> 06:19.240]  The globalist's great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[06:19.240 --> 06:40.600]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday, March 26, 2017.
[06:40.600 --> 06:44.520]  Here's Alex Jones about what's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[06:44.520 --> 06:53.280]  I've tried to quantify in the last three, four months exactly what we've covered with
[06:53.280 --> 06:58.960]  the Podesta emails and Wiener, the New York Times admitting it's about to be indicted
[06:58.960 --> 07:04.880]  for child pornography, and Jerry Epstein and the Lolita Express with the children being
[07:04.880 --> 07:08.280]  flown out for sex slavery, Bill Clinton being on board.
[07:08.280 --> 07:11.800]  That's been in CNN Associated Press, you name it.
[07:11.800 --> 07:16.720]  And we've covered all that as it unfolds, we've all seen the big pedophile networks
[07:16.720 --> 07:19.720]  in Europe and the pedophile networks in the UK.
[07:19.720 --> 07:23.400]  This really is the rulers of the world, these vampires.
[07:23.400 --> 07:27.760]  And so going back into November, I saw everybody focused off of what we were covering in New
[07:27.760 --> 07:35.480]  York and the law enforcement reports onto a pizza place there in D.C.
[07:35.480 --> 07:39.680]  So we looked at it and I saw some fake reports mixed in and I said, listen, we're killing
[07:39.680 --> 07:43.560]  this because it's a diversion from all the admitted child trafficking, all the admitted
[07:43.560 --> 07:51.520]  stuff going on, and I believe that the media has focused on some innocent place as a diversion
[07:51.520 --> 07:53.360]  and what it just credit takes for it to help.
[07:53.360 --> 07:57.080]  They're pretty much saying now the Catholic Church never had a pedophile problem or that
[07:57.080 --> 08:01.080]  Penn State didn't have a problem or Jerry Sandusky didn't have a problem or his son.
[08:01.080 --> 08:06.280]  And the truth is Trump and the Patriots in our intelligence agencies are aware of this
[08:06.280 --> 08:09.720]  and they're as Town Halls reported, rolling up these networks.
[08:09.720 --> 08:18.200]  So I put out a retraction clarification Friday, specifically on Comet Ping Pong and Mr. Alfonso.
[08:18.200 --> 08:23.880]  I don't believe we're involved in all this because I want to kill that debate, that discussion,
[08:23.880 --> 08:28.680]  which the media keeps claiming I'm behind to force it onto the real issues that we're
[08:28.680 --> 08:29.760]  actually pointing at.
[08:29.760 --> 08:33.400]  So I point fingers coming up at the bottom of the hour of where I think people should
[08:33.400 --> 08:37.920]  research, where the facts are, and where pizza gate has diverted people.
[08:37.920 --> 08:41.880]  Some folks say, oh my God, you're trying to cover up crimes against children.
[08:41.880 --> 08:43.380]  No, I'm not.
[08:43.380 --> 08:48.560]  Fake news reports or mainstream media hyping something up saying nothing's happening there.
[08:48.560 --> 08:50.120]  So we all run there to cover it.
[08:50.120 --> 08:55.120]  It's a classic diversionary tactic and I think they're using Comet Ping Pong and Alfonso
[08:55.120 --> 08:56.920]  and others as the diversionary issue.
[08:56.920 --> 09:01.480]  I've been saying that since December 1st, I put an internal memo and info or saying this
[09:01.480 --> 09:03.000]  is a diversion, it's a distraction.
[09:03.000 --> 09:05.240]  We didn't create the story.
[09:05.240 --> 09:06.240]  We didn't push it for weeks.
[09:06.240 --> 09:10.560]  Some of our listeners kind of bullied us into covering it and then once I saw Telltale
[09:10.560 --> 09:12.880]  Signs, I said, no, we're not doing it.
[09:12.880 --> 09:13.880]  So that's what's happening.
[09:13.880 --> 09:17.600]  This is an attempt by the established but to claim there's no child sex abuse in the
[09:17.600 --> 09:18.600]  world.
[09:18.600 --> 09:23.400]  Pedophilia doesn't exist and none of this is happening, even the Salon magazine promotes
[09:23.400 --> 09:24.920]  pedophilia.
[09:24.920 --> 09:31.040]  So we're here exposing all this big report, breaking it all down as we go on the offense
[09:31.040 --> 09:35.200]  against the real predators against children and expose some of the tricks they've been
[09:35.200 --> 09:36.800]  using to divert us off.
[09:36.800 --> 09:41.040]  So back to David Knight, my special report comes up in about 20 minutes at infowars.com.
[09:41.040 --> 09:44.760]  Post spread the word, history is happening now.
[09:44.760 --> 09:45.760]  Thank you, Alex.
[09:45.760 --> 09:48.960]  And of course, we're going to play that report at the bottom of the hour.
[09:48.960 --> 09:52.960]  As I was talking about at the top of the hour as we came in, those of you who are just joining
[09:52.960 --> 09:58.640]  us now, we've seen John McCain essentially gloating this weekend over what happened in
[09:58.640 --> 10:00.160]  Washington.
[10:00.160 --> 10:05.760]  And as he sees this as his side winning, and one of the things that he said was, Donald
[10:05.760 --> 10:10.640]  Trump failed on this because he needs to reach out to the other side, to the Democrats and
[10:10.640 --> 10:12.680]  other opponents, in other words, like him.
[10:12.680 --> 10:17.000]  You have to understand that John McCain and Lindsey Graham have put themselves up as leaders
[10:17.000 --> 10:18.000]  of the opposition.
[10:18.000 --> 10:23.040]  The Democrats are in such disarray that they're not really an effective opposition.
[10:23.040 --> 10:28.160]  And we have to understand we do not need the Democrats to repeal Obamacare.
[10:28.160 --> 10:30.760]  They didn't need the Republicans to pass it, did they?
[10:30.760 --> 10:34.440]  And we've got a much stronger situation than they did at this point.
[10:34.440 --> 10:37.240]  What we lack is the understanding and the will to do it.
[10:37.240 --> 10:41.440]  But I want to repeat what I said at the top of the hour about John McCain, the fact that
[10:41.440 --> 10:44.560]  he goes to Brussels, and he says this type of stuff.
[10:44.560 --> 10:48.240]  We have a new world order that is under enormous strain.
[10:48.240 --> 10:51.760]  We have a titanic struggle with the forces of radicalism.
[10:51.760 --> 10:56.920]  And of course, he's not really concerned about Islamic radicalism.
[10:56.920 --> 11:00.720]  He's concerned about nationals, people who want nationalism.
[11:00.720 --> 11:05.760]  That's the radicals that really concern him because that's where he focuses his speech.
[11:05.760 --> 11:10.120]  He said the EU and the US need to develop more connectivity.
[11:10.120 --> 11:12.560]  He said, I trust the EU.
[11:12.560 --> 11:14.200]  He doesn't trust Donald Trump.
[11:14.200 --> 11:16.320]  He doesn't trust our Constitution.
[11:16.320 --> 11:20.200]  He doesn't trust the form of government that we had until the early 20th century, where
[11:20.200 --> 11:23.680]  we basically had free trade within the United States.
[11:23.680 --> 11:29.840]  But we collected our taxes at the border for goods that were coming into our country.
[11:29.840 --> 11:33.360]  And you understand that when they created the income tax and they created the Federal
[11:33.360 --> 11:39.120]  Reserve at the same time, they also flipped our tax system so that we weren't collecting
[11:39.120 --> 11:45.440]  the taxes at the border, but we turned taxation again inside on American citizens and on American
[11:45.440 --> 11:46.440]  businesses.
[11:46.440 --> 11:49.040]  And that's the way that it has remained.
[11:49.040 --> 11:53.320]  Thomas Jefferson said in his second inaugural address, and I've mentioned this many times,
[11:53.320 --> 11:56.640]  we need to remember what he did in one term.
[11:56.640 --> 12:02.160]  He said, we have eliminated useless offices, and by doing so, we have been able to eliminate
[12:02.160 --> 12:07.360]  all internal taxation, so all their taxes were funded by tariffs on goods that were coming
[12:07.360 --> 12:08.360]  in.
[12:08.360 --> 12:13.280]  That allowed a free trade zone within America, and it allowed America to get strong.
[12:13.280 --> 12:19.520]  And he said, what labor or what mechanic knows the tax man in America, nobody.
[12:19.520 --> 12:24.000]  So they could go about their lives without being harassed and micromanaged from Washington.
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.880]  That's why we need to get rid of Obama tax.
[12:26.880 --> 12:32.600]  I don't want to go back to 1776 as well on this, but you have to understand, American
[12:32.600 --> 12:38.640]  Revolution was fought over 3% tax on T. It wasn't the level of taxation.
[12:38.640 --> 12:41.520]  It was who was imposing it, and the way that it was imposed.
[12:41.520 --> 12:45.960]  And as I said in the last segment, Donald Trump was absolutely right to just throw out
[12:45.960 --> 12:46.960]  TPP.
[12:46.960 --> 12:53.600]  He did not want to mess with that and manage that around the edges and say, well, we never
[12:53.600 --> 12:56.440]  really got a chance to have an open public debate about this.
[12:56.440 --> 13:02.080]  It was done in secret, like Paul Ryan's bill, like Nancy Pelosi's bill with Obamacare initially.
[13:02.080 --> 13:03.920]  We don't want to have legislation that way.
[13:03.920 --> 13:06.160]  That's enough reason right there to reject it.
[13:06.160 --> 13:09.000]  The way it was presented, the way it was hidden from us.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.600]  Do you even know what's in Obamacare for the most part?
[13:11.600 --> 13:13.120]  Of course you don't.
[13:13.120 --> 13:17.640]  Most of us don't really know, we do know that our healthcare premiums have skyrocketed,
[13:17.640 --> 13:18.800]  and there's a reason for that.
[13:18.800 --> 13:22.160]  We had a situation, think about it, we had a couple of different classes of people.
[13:22.160 --> 13:24.520]  We had some people who didn't want it, they didn't buy it.
[13:24.520 --> 13:26.040]  Well, they're not going to be allowed to do that.
[13:26.040 --> 13:29.360]  We're going to have the government hold a gun to their head and force them to do that.
[13:29.360 --> 13:33.000]  We had other people who couldn't afford it, but they wanted you to pay for it, including
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.720]  illegal immigrants, and that's what they did with that.
[13:35.720 --> 13:39.040]  And then you had those who wanted it, but now they can no longer afford it.
[13:39.040 --> 13:42.760]  That's what Obamacare, affordable healthcare, has done for us.
[13:42.760 --> 13:46.360]  So there's another aspect of this, it's very important, and it reflects back on this 3%
[13:46.360 --> 13:47.840]  tax on tea issue.
[13:47.840 --> 13:52.120]  And of course, we know that, like I said, it wasn't the level of taxation, we've got
[13:52.120 --> 13:57.000]  many states, they tax food, they tax all your food, not just your tea, they tax everything
[13:57.000 --> 13:58.000]  you eat.
[13:58.000 --> 14:01.440]  In many places they tax your medicines as well, some states they have exemptions for
[14:01.440 --> 14:05.440]  those things, but in a lot of states they tax at all.
[14:05.440 --> 14:07.440]  They did in North Carolina.
[14:07.440 --> 14:12.720]  And so what you have is a situation where, yeah, people will put up with an 8% tax on
[14:12.720 --> 14:17.680]  everything, not just their tea, but they want to have a say so in what's going on with
[14:17.680 --> 14:18.680]  this.
[14:18.680 --> 14:22.200]  They don't want to have this stuff dictated to them by foreign bureaucrats, or people
[14:22.200 --> 14:24.000]  are very distant from them.
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.720]  These bureaucrats in Washington might as well be from a foreign country.
[14:27.720 --> 14:32.960]  Washington is a foreign country, as Matt Drudge said, the swamp is draining you.
[14:32.960 --> 14:36.200]  You're not draining the swamp at this point, but understand the structure of this.
[14:36.200 --> 14:41.320]  This is key as to why many people said you must repeal the mechanism, just like you repealed
[14:41.320 --> 14:42.880]  the mechanism of TPP.
[14:42.880 --> 14:49.200]  TPP, and I think Donald Trump understood this, TPP wasn't simply about some organization
[14:49.200 --> 14:51.080]  that was above all the other countries.
[14:51.080 --> 14:54.720]  It was going to determine which industries and which countries are going to be allowed
[14:54.720 --> 14:59.120]  to succeed at the expense of other industries and other countries.
[14:59.120 --> 15:06.040]  Now what it did was it created a transnational governing committee for which we had no representation.
[15:06.040 --> 15:08.800]  And that committee, as it was being sold to us, they said, well, we need to have this
[15:08.800 --> 15:11.920]  as a bulwark against Chinese competition.
[15:11.920 --> 15:15.680]  Well they could have added China the very next day, because as just sessions pointed
[15:15.680 --> 15:18.440]  out, it was a living document.
[15:18.440 --> 15:22.240]  Those people who were going to be in that little committee, they would be able to change
[15:22.240 --> 15:24.120]  anything about that secret document.
[15:24.120 --> 15:28.840]  I guess it's one of the reasons why it wasn't really important, was it, that we see that.
[15:28.840 --> 15:31.480]  Because anything in that document could be changed.
[15:31.480 --> 15:33.880]  The same thing happened with Obamacare.
[15:33.880 --> 15:36.780]  It really wasn't important that you understand that bill.
[15:36.780 --> 15:40.560]  After the bill got passed, Nancy Pelosi was right, then we would see what was in it.
[15:40.560 --> 15:45.640]  Because it would be turned over to a bureaucracy that would exercise that same kind of dictatorial
[15:45.640 --> 15:46.640]  power.
[15:46.640 --> 15:51.400]  And it's not enough to have a health czar, when that health czar is a good guy, like
[15:51.400 --> 15:52.400]  Tom Price.
[15:52.400 --> 15:53.400]  How long is he going to be there?
[15:53.400 --> 15:55.120]  Two, three, four years, maybe eight years?
[15:55.120 --> 15:57.880]  Then who takes his place and overturns everything he undead?
[15:57.880 --> 16:27.840]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[16:58.140 --> 17:04.780]  5 star ratings on major third party sites is because I want products I'm going to use

[17:25.760 --> 17:43.760]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my Super Female, I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again, very exciting, feeling great, looking good, and I know my hair is luxurious once again, so obviously the Super Female is amazing, I love it.
[17:43.760 --> 17:59.760]  Nascent Iodine is essential. Survival Shield X2, if there's one product that I would say is life changing that I would suggest it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2, it's got a five star rating, it's a win-win in FullWarsLife.com.
[18:14.760 --> 18:24.760]  What the aging process is is when the cell replicates we lose a little bit of our telomeres. Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[18:24.760 --> 18:26.760]  And when it runs out you start dying.
[18:26.760 --> 18:38.760]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials, it's one of the most effective substances in the world, it works like an antioxidant, it works to repair nerve growth factor.

[20:03.520 --> 20:06.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:06.240 --> 20:35.360]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight. We're going to have Alex joining us with
[20:35.360 --> 20:39.600]  a report at the bottom of the hour, but I want to finish up on what we had been talking about in
[20:39.600 --> 20:46.080]  the last segment and that is the failure to repeal Obamacare. And as I look at it, it was a failure
[20:46.080 --> 20:51.520]  to try because it was being led by Paul Ryan, a man that we know did not want to repeal Obamacare.
[20:51.520 --> 20:56.160]  This is a man that was handpicked to run with Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney had already put in Obamacare
[20:56.160 --> 21:02.800]  in Massachusetts with Ted Kennedy. It's going to be exactly identical to that. And we've had Paul Ryan
[21:02.800 --> 21:08.720]  working against that, working against borders, closing the borders, always open borders, has
[21:08.720 --> 21:13.360]  been Paul Ryan, also working against Trump on trade. He is going to be the opposition. And of
[21:13.360 --> 21:19.120]  course, John McCain was reminding everybody that he was the opposition in Brussels this weekend,
[21:19.920 --> 21:25.920]  talking to the European leadership there at the EU, telling them how much he loves their new world
[21:25.920 --> 21:31.520]  order, how essential it is for the US and the European Union to merge together to have much
[21:31.520 --> 21:35.840]  closer ties. This is what we were concerned about with these partnership agreements.
[21:35.840 --> 21:39.920]  They always create an economic unity, then they create a sovereign unity. And of course,
[21:39.920 --> 21:44.240]  there's also a military component to this as well. But when we look at the Trans-Pacific
[21:44.240 --> 21:49.920]  Partnership, and when we look at what happened in 1776, both of these, when we got rid of them,
[21:49.920 --> 21:54.480]  when Donald Trump threw out the TPP and said it's dead, he didn't try to reform it, he just killed
[21:54.480 --> 21:59.200]  it. That's what he should have done with Obamacare, should have taken a decisive action on that. And
[21:59.200 --> 22:05.760]  hopefully, that will still happen. And here's why. For the same reason that we had a revolution here
[22:05.760 --> 22:11.920]  in 1776, because we didn't want a foreign body to control our economy, just like TPP.
[22:11.920 --> 22:14.960]  We didn't want people saying, well, we're going to mandate this for you, we're going to raise a
[22:14.960 --> 22:18.480]  tax as to whatever we want, and you're not going to have any say so about it. Remember, taxation
[22:18.480 --> 22:22.880]  without representation. Now, we have not only taxation without representation, but we have
[22:22.880 --> 22:28.560]  taxation without, we have regulation without representation. That's the bureaucracy in Washington
[22:28.560 --> 22:34.320]  that decides everything. We've had our Congress abdicate everything to them. That's why Nancy
[22:34.320 --> 22:37.840]  Pelosi can say, well, you have to read the bill to find out what's in it. That's why Paul Ryan can
[22:37.840 --> 22:42.560]  do the same thing. It doesn't really matter what bill they produce, just as it didn't really matter
[22:42.560 --> 22:47.680]  what TPP was, because TPP would be changed by the international bureaucracy that you would have no
[22:47.680 --> 22:52.160]  control over once they got it established. Just as Obamacare would be changed by the
[22:52.720 --> 22:57.440]  government bureaucracy, the health and human services bureaucracy. Now, when we look at this idea
[22:57.440 --> 23:01.840]  that we have three phases where this is going to come through, and of course, Trump said phase two
[23:01.840 --> 23:06.080]  and three are coming of this wonderful healthcare overhaul. He said they're going to be coming soon.
[23:06.080 --> 23:12.160]  I want to take a look at Paul Ryan's description of the three phases of repeal and replace.
[23:12.800 --> 23:18.080]  Now, he says we're going to take advantage of the budget reconciliation process to avoid a
[23:18.080 --> 23:22.720]  Democratic filibuster. Well, there were some things that were taken out, other things that were not
[23:22.720 --> 23:27.280]  taken out in that process. And then we don't really know how that's going to be reconciled
[23:27.280 --> 23:31.360]  due to, because that's also a kind of a closed process. It's negotiated between the Senate and
[23:31.360 --> 23:36.480]  the House. So they put a lot of stuff there that they, again, it's a lot of shell games.
[23:36.480 --> 23:42.160]  And we hear from Paul Ryan and the GOP establishment that have fought tooth and nail to keep Obamacare
[23:42.160 --> 23:45.920]  from being repealed. Just trust us, we'll get there. We'll get there in phase two and phase three.
[23:45.920 --> 23:49.120]  I know it's not here in phase one, but trust us, it'll be there in phase two and three. Well,
[23:49.120 --> 23:55.120]  what's phase two? Phase two says Paul Ryan. This is his report, phase two. Phase two will be all
[23:55.120 --> 24:00.000]  the regulatory flexibility that the secretary of HHS has to deregulate. That's the best argument
[24:00.000 --> 24:06.000]  for repeal against Obamacare right there. We should not have a czar over our health care.
[24:06.960 --> 24:11.280]  That along with the mandates and the taxes and lies that were sold to us with Obamacare telling
[24:11.280 --> 24:17.440]  us in the Supreme Court as we had Justice Roberts say, well, okay, they don't have the capability
[24:17.440 --> 24:22.560]  to mandate that you buy health care from somebody else, but they can put an economic penalty against
[24:22.560 --> 24:27.120]  you and force you to buy it from somebody else and call it a tax. No, a tax is what the government
[24:27.120 --> 24:31.520]  collects from its citizens. And quite frankly, if we go back and look at the Constitution,
[24:31.520 --> 24:36.480]  they don't have the ability to directly tax us as individuals. That's what many of the tax
[24:36.480 --> 24:40.720]  protesters have pointed out to people, but nobody's listening to that either. When you ignore the
[24:40.720 --> 24:44.960]  Constitution, this is what we wind up with. What we're going to wind up with, if we have a situation
[24:44.960 --> 24:50.560]  where we use all the flexibility and the dictatorial powers of Tom Price to shut down certain aspects
[24:50.560 --> 24:55.040]  of Obamacare, those aspects will be put right back in with the next HHS secretary.
[24:56.320 --> 25:00.400]  Whenever that comes, whether that's four years from now or eight years from now,
[25:00.960 --> 25:05.120]  we have to get rid of that power. That's what Donald Trump understood about the TPP,
[25:05.120 --> 25:10.640]  that we couldn't have this transnational body dictating our economy to us. We can't have
[25:10.640 --> 25:16.800]  HHS dictating our health care to us. That's got to stop. That's why we have to have repeal.
[25:16.800 --> 25:21.920]  The fundamental structure of Obamacare has to go. Then we can start replacing the coercion with
[25:21.920 --> 25:28.080]  choice. We can start replacing the mandates with marketplace. You have to understand that we have
[25:28.080 --> 25:36.160]  to have choices as consumers. You will never control cost if you go with a command control
[25:36.160 --> 25:42.640]  economy directed from the center. If you believe that, I'll give you a free ticket to Venezuelan
[25:42.640 --> 25:47.440]  bakery. Go down there and see what's happening. They're locking people up in jail because of
[25:47.440 --> 25:52.480]  the scarcity they've got there. They're bakeries. They're hunting down policemen in the street to
[25:52.480 --> 25:59.120]  rob them of their guns. They're killing dogs and cats in the streets. It's absolute chaos because
[25:59.120 --> 26:04.880]  that's where this always leads when you try to rob other people to get what you can't afford.
[26:05.440 --> 26:10.080]  Of course, we're robbing other people to give benefits to illegal aliens who come into our
[26:10.080 --> 26:14.320]  country or giving them health care. The bottom line is when you look at phase two and they're
[26:14.320 --> 26:19.920]  touting that Tom Price, Secretary of HHS, he might replace a lot of this stuff. Remember,
[26:19.920 --> 26:24.720]  we have this back and forth every time we get a Republican changeover from a Republican to a
[26:24.720 --> 26:31.920]  Democrat and vice versa. They would always fund abortions with NGOs abroad or they would stop the
[26:31.920 --> 26:35.840]  funding of abortion with NGOs abroad. They go back and forth. They go back and forth. That's
[26:35.840 --> 26:39.600]  why they talk about, well, now we've got Planned Parenthood. We're going to get rid of Planned
[26:39.600 --> 26:44.880]  Parenthood. No, you're not. You're not going to get rid of anything if you don't get rid of this
[26:44.880 --> 26:52.080]  power that has been given to HHS and the bureaucracy. That has to stop. We have to have a Congress
[26:52.080 --> 26:57.120]  that is going to seize that power. And I'm glad that we had people who stood on principle and said,
[26:57.120 --> 27:01.040]  no, we have to get rid of this structure. We have to understand what's truly happening here.
[27:02.000 --> 27:06.720]  Somebody needs to explain to Donald Trump that what is going on here is not,
[27:06.720 --> 27:10.400]  we've got the Titanic healthcare. And he understands that. It's going to sink. It's
[27:10.400 --> 27:15.280]  going to go down. It's not sustainable. When we had the CBO look at their grading,
[27:15.280 --> 27:21.760]  they said more people are going to lose healthcare. If you put this in and continue to kick this can
[27:21.760 --> 27:27.280]  down the road, continue to drive the Titanic toward the iceberg, albeit at a maybe slower
[27:27.280 --> 27:30.880]  speed, more people are going to lose their healthcare than if you just repeal this thing.
[27:30.880 --> 27:39.040]  And who got their healthcare? Again, it was people who A, had chosen not to get it or B,
[27:39.040 --> 27:43.120]  people who couldn't afford it. And they did it at the expense of people who wanted it and could
[27:43.120 --> 27:48.720]  afford it and had the ability previously to make a choice about what insurance coverage they wanted.
[27:48.720 --> 27:55.920]  That's expanding the welfare roles for the purpose of a socialist healthcare system is not
[27:55.920 --> 28:02.160]  something that we should be using as a metric of success. That is a metric of failure. So we
[28:02.160 --> 28:07.600]  talk about how many people were added to the roles because of Obamacare. That's not the metric. You
[28:07.600 --> 28:12.240]  have to look at what has happened to our healthcare costs and to our insurance costs. That's the metric,
[28:12.240 --> 28:16.560]  not the number of people that have been added to the welfare state. That's not the thing that we
[28:16.560 --> 28:21.280]  want to optimize unless you're a Democrat, unless you're trying to keep people dependent on you,
[28:21.280 --> 28:27.040]  because that's your path to political power. Republicans should reject that out of hand.
[28:27.040 --> 28:31.200]  They should reject the command control economy. They should reject the czar,
[28:31.200 --> 28:36.560]  even if the czar is a benevolent dictator for four years or eight years. We don't want that
[28:36.560 --> 28:42.480]  struggle. And when you talk about getting rid of interstate competition across state lines,
[28:42.480 --> 28:47.520]  that should have been gotten rid of by the commerce clause. The real constitutional commerce clause
[28:47.520 --> 28:51.120]  is exactly the opposite of what they use it for. They use a commerce clause for their illegal
[28:51.120 --> 28:55.200]  prohibition of drugs. Instead, they ought to use it to create a free market in America. They could
[28:55.200 --> 29:22.000]  do that now. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[29:25.520 --> 29:36.800]  And basically it boils down to this. While it's legal for the deep state to collect
[29:36.800 --> 29:42.080]  intelligence on foreign targets, it's not legal for the names of U.S. citizens to be unmasked.
[29:42.080 --> 29:46.560]  This was done and was disseminated through intelligence reports. Now looking back at Trump's
[29:46.560 --> 29:52.640]  March 4th wiretapping tweets, it seems he was right all along. Soon we will find out if Obama
[29:52.640 --> 29:57.360]  administration officials are too big to jail. Rob Dew reporting for info wars dot com and info

[31:59.760 --> 32:05.280]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it
[32:05.280 --> 32:10.320]  became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk. We are now introducing caveman by info
[32:10.320 --> 32:15.520]  wars life dot com. The ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root,
[32:15.520 --> 32:22.080]  shaga mushroom and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula caveman. It's
[32:22.080 --> 32:26.960]  those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors
[32:26.960 --> 32:32.080]  and we need to do everything we can to recapture that. Everyone knew that you used all the parts
[32:32.080 --> 32:37.040]  of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for
[32:37.040 --> 32:41.760]  strength from the outside structure full of minerals and kiko factors to the marrow that
[32:41.760 --> 32:46.880]  produces the blood for the body. This is the engine of the life essence. I'm a long way from
[32:46.880 --> 32:51.840]  the caveman my ancestors were but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us

[33:20.080 --> 33:24.720]  And now your host David Knight.
[33:28.880 --> 33:34.880]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight on this Sunday, March 26, 2017. I want to
[33:34.880 --> 33:40.240]  go back and talk about the fundamental problems with Obamacare, the necessity for repeal. But
[33:40.240 --> 33:45.120]  before we do real quickly we really appreciate your support especially at this time that we see
[33:45.120 --> 33:50.640]  that Google is trying to do everything that they can in YouTube and Facebook to try to censor our
[33:50.640 --> 33:56.320]  news going out blaming us and saying that it's Russians were Russian bots we're putting out
[33:56.320 --> 34:02.160]  our stories but of course it's their bots that are shutting down your ability to share our stories
[34:02.160 --> 34:06.080]  that are attacking our stories and of course the latest evidence of this we've seen them go in both
[34:06.080 --> 34:12.640]  ways in terms of attacking ads. First they said well we're not going to let you advertise on our
[34:12.640 --> 34:18.080]  ad placement products you know we go to a website and they have these third party organizations
[34:18.080 --> 34:24.800]  this particular one ad role works with Google and they will serve our ads for our products for
[34:24.800 --> 34:31.600]  things like brain force for things like colloidal silver they will serve those ads on other websites
[34:31.600 --> 34:36.880]  and and we can try to get sales for that and of course that directs people to our info wars life
[34:36.880 --> 34:40.240]  or info wars store that are not political sites and say well we're not going to allow that to
[34:40.240 --> 34:45.760]  happen now they're going the other direction as well they're trying to throttle the revenue i
[34:45.760 --> 34:50.320]  guess we should start calling them rev limiters you know you've got on an engine this is the engine
[34:50.320 --> 34:54.560]  of freedom the engine of free speech and they're trying to put rev limiters on it limiting our
[34:54.560 --> 34:58.720]  revenue in both directions first of all saying we're not going to allow you to serve ads and
[34:58.720 --> 35:03.680]  then saying and then we're not going to let people put ads on your videos because guess who's
[35:03.680 --> 35:09.600]  complaining about it people like HSBC and others are the tip of the spear and saying we don't
[35:09.600 --> 35:14.880]  want to see our ads show up on youtube as a matter of fact i was kind of curious because
[35:14.880 --> 35:22.560]  i thought about this and it never really occurred to me when i saw ads being served on youtube videos
[35:22.560 --> 35:28.480]  at the front of the youtube videos i never really thought of that as a sponsorship of that particular
[35:28.480 --> 35:34.320]  company of the content that was there i knew there was no conscious coordination there so i put a
[35:34.320 --> 35:40.080]  poll up on my twitter account libertarian because i'm kind of interested in what you think it's not
[35:40.080 --> 35:45.360]  like television where you they go out and they get a specific sponsor they go out and they get
[35:45.360 --> 35:50.880]  general motors and they say we you know we're going to have the gm is going to sponsor this show or
[35:50.880 --> 35:55.360]  back in the old days it would sponsor the entire thing you'd have borax sponsoring ronald reagan
[35:55.360 --> 36:02.160]  on death valley days well you could very clearly say that these people are standing behind everything
[36:02.160 --> 36:05.600]  that's being said on that television show when they do something like that but when it's an ad
[36:05.600 --> 36:10.400]  that's being served on youtube these are just ads that are coming in at random and they're being
[36:10.400 --> 36:16.400]  thrown up by by youtube they're not being thrown up and google didn't go out or gm didn't go out
[36:16.400 --> 36:20.640]  there and say hey i want to put an ad on david night's video now this is just something that
[36:20.640 --> 36:25.520]  went out there by youtube so we have the thing monetized there you can see the the poll they've
[36:25.520 --> 36:30.240]  pulled that up there at libertarian if you want to vote on that poll i'm curious as to what you
[36:30.240 --> 36:36.640]  think because i think when i looked at this my take on this was that they're trying to shut down
[36:36.640 --> 36:40.000]  our revenue they're trying to shut down the revenue of third parties anybody that they say
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.960]  is deemed to be controversial and that would be controversial would be anybody that reports the
[36:44.960 --> 36:50.240]  fact that hsbc has been convicted multiple times of money laundering and gotten off with a slap on
[36:50.240 --> 36:55.840]  the hand each time when we talk about that i guess hsbc sees that as controversial and they would
[36:55.840 --> 37:01.360]  not like to see their ad pop on up on a video where i'm talking about that they would like to see us
[37:01.360 --> 37:07.040]  go away quite frankly they really would and so that's going to be the result of this type of
[37:07.040 --> 37:11.920]  movement when they can go out and facebook can shut down your articles your videos your content
[37:11.920 --> 37:15.920]  by saying well we think that's fake we're going to be the arbiters of what's true and what isn't
[37:15.920 --> 37:22.000]  or we're going to give that to those wizards at snopes when they can do that and they can be the
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.080]  arbiters of truth and they can shut you down by saying you're not true we don't agree with you
[37:26.080 --> 37:29.840]  blah blah blah they can they can censure you that way or they can come out and say well
[37:29.840 --> 37:34.480]  we simply think that that's controversial see they don't even have to go to the point of saying
[37:34.480 --> 37:38.880]  it's fake now they can just say it's controversial so we're going to shut down your revenue
[37:39.600 --> 37:43.840]  we're going to censor your videos and of course they're still letting the videos
[37:43.840 --> 37:49.760]  go out they're just cutting down the ad revenue to that so we appreciate you standing with us

[39:54.880 --> 39:59.040]  and we have some interesting news about second amendment that i'm going to get to here in a
[39:59.040 --> 40:05.120]  moment but i don't want to get to that before i finish with the obama care repeal that needs
[40:05.120 --> 40:10.160]  to happen that must happen and as i was just talking about these three phases of repeal
[40:10.160 --> 40:15.120]  repeal so they had the first phase which is going to be a legislative repeal of some things
[40:15.920 --> 40:20.720]  but then there was said phase two is going to be done by our wonderful health and human
[40:20.720 --> 40:25.360]  services secretary tom price and he's going to go through and just rip out stuff because
[40:26.000 --> 40:34.480]  obama care has established the hhs secretary as a czar over your health care now i don't
[40:34.480 --> 40:41.120]  want to see that that kind of structure the mandates the army of irs agents who demand to know
[40:41.120 --> 40:46.080]  if you've got health insurance and demand that you get a particular type of health insurance
[40:46.080 --> 40:52.800]  that's what we're talking about we say repeal and this bill did not do that the very fact that
[40:52.800 --> 40:57.360]  they're talking about phase two being an essential part of this means that they're leaving in the
[40:57.360 --> 41:02.640]  structure the dictatorial structure of obama care we do not want that that's not what we voted for
[41:02.640 --> 41:09.840]  for listen to us we don't want our health care being micromanaged out of washington by a bunch
[41:09.840 --> 41:14.000]  of socialist bureaucrats and we don't want it being ripped around every time we've got an election
[41:15.200 --> 41:18.800]  so one election some of this stuff is taken out the next election will be put right back in
[41:19.440 --> 41:25.920]  right back in when you get chelsea clinton as president god forbid but something like that
[41:25.920 --> 41:30.960]  happens what's he going to do with her health and human services secretary exactly what you
[41:30.960 --> 41:34.880]  don't want to see happen and then i was just talking about phase three they say we're going to
[41:34.880 --> 41:42.240]  allow competition across straight state lines now right now that's prohibited the commerce clause
[41:42.240 --> 41:46.720]  should prohibit that kind of prohibition the commerce clause and the constitution was set up
[41:46.720 --> 41:50.800]  so that we would have free trade within the united states but isn't it interesting that the very
[41:50.800 --> 41:55.040]  people that are always telling us we have to have free trade with other nations will not allow us to
[41:55.040 --> 42:01.760]  have free trade and health care across borders do you smell a rat do you think they got cards
[42:01.760 --> 42:08.000]  that they're not showing you yeah absolutely if we were to enforce the commerce clause and this
[42:08.000 --> 42:12.880]  could be done by the justice department saying no as a lot as long as these insurance companies are
[42:12.880 --> 42:18.240]  not engaging in fraud people can choose to buy what they want regardless of where these insurance
[42:18.240 --> 42:22.560]  companies are so if it's not fraudulent health care they should be able to pick and choose what
[42:22.560 --> 42:28.480]  they want they should not have a gun held to their head as and call it essential health benefits
[42:29.280 --> 42:34.880]  and say we're going to mandate that single men have to get maternity care or that nuns have to
[42:34.880 --> 42:40.000]  get abortion care and so forth that's essential care and they said wait well you know we're going
[42:40.000 --> 42:45.520]  to have some negotiations on that at the last minute they brought the freedom caucus and said
[42:45.520 --> 42:48.960]  we'll talk about some of these things that are an essential health care benefits that we might want
[42:48.960 --> 42:55.520]  to cut no no you're rearranging the deck chairs on titanic health care it's headed for the iceberg
[42:56.160 --> 43:00.000]  and it's not enough to say you're not going to be there we'll be right back we have the new

[47:44.960 --> 47:50.800]  course if you were to name a boy sue today that would be a term of endearment wouldn't it this is
[47:50.800 --> 47:55.920]  the upside down world we live in today uh so it wouldn't be a problem if you name your boy sue today
[47:55.920 --> 48:02.320]  or if you get your boy to wear skirts but back in the day when we knew where we were we knew what we
[48:02.320 --> 48:08.880]  were uh that was a bit of a problem now we've got a family in atlanta trying to name their daughter
[48:08.880 --> 48:17.040]  a la and i gotta say that if they're successful in doing this they are going to create more conflict
[48:17.040 --> 48:22.640]  for her and her life and the world that we live in today in this world than johnny cash would have
[48:22.640 --> 48:28.640]  had if he had been named sue because she's going to have every every muslim gunning for her because
[48:28.640 --> 48:35.440]  that's basically an affront to their religion they do not allow people to name each other
[48:35.440 --> 48:42.320]  a la and their religion but this is a family in atlanta and they're going to be suing the state
[48:42.320 --> 48:48.400]  officials because the husband and wife are not married they don't have the same name
[48:49.200 --> 48:57.120]  and they want to give this other name as a last name to their daughter so it's they said that
[48:57.120 --> 49:02.560]  state law says that you've got to use as a surname as a last name you have to use one parent or the
[49:02.560 --> 49:08.320]  other or a combination of those two names that's the state law but they don't want to do that and
[49:08.320 --> 49:12.960]  of course they've had some very eccentric names that they came up with before they got to the
[49:12.960 --> 49:21.680]  surname the first name was zalika graceful lorena a la is what they want to call her
[49:22.560 --> 49:28.000]  and the state says okay you can use all those other names whatever you know moon unit the zappa
[49:28.000 --> 49:35.200]  or but you can't use a la because it has to be the mother's name or the father's name or
[49:35.200 --> 49:40.800]  a combination of those two names and as i just pointed out as a practical matter why would you
[49:40.800 --> 49:45.680]  want to do that to your child but we now see that the aclu is going to go to bat for them
[49:45.680 --> 49:50.320]  and is going to get involved in these kind of sensational minutiae that the aclu always does
[49:51.360 --> 49:56.800]  the issues that we have with dragnet surveillance with the shredding of the constitution all that
[49:56.800 --> 50:01.520]  stuff just sails over the aclu but whenever they find something that's sensational or something
[50:01.520 --> 50:06.640]  that panders to the radical left you can bet that they'll be there in court especially if they can
[50:06.640 --> 50:12.480]  make money suing christians or suing jurisdictions because they say that uh you're exercising
[50:12.480 --> 50:16.800]  christianity no no we can't have that the aclu will always be there to fund themselves so now
[50:16.800 --> 50:22.800]  they're going to get into this as they ignore the big issues and solve the camels and strain at the
[50:22.800 --> 50:29.840]  gnats we also see another interesting story here out of winchester virginia we have virginia police
[50:29.840 --> 50:35.520]  arrest a guy and show this picture of this guy he did a pretty good job of makeup in terms of
[50:35.520 --> 50:41.600]  turning himself into the uh joker that he's ledger did here virginia police arrest a sword
[50:41.600 --> 50:46.720]  wheeling man who is dressed as the joker this was on the drudge report they charged him with
[50:46.720 --> 50:53.360]  wearing a mask in public that is a felony under state law and so when i looked at that a mask
[50:53.360 --> 51:02.000]  really uh i mean it's makeup okay it's not truly a mask and the statute however says this is virginia
[51:02.000 --> 51:09.360]  code 18.2-422 it shall be unlawful for any person over 16 years of age with the intent to conceal
[51:09.360 --> 51:16.800]  his identity where any mask hood or other device whereby a substantial portion of the face is hidden
[51:18.080 --> 51:22.640]  or is covered so as to conceal the identity of the where or to be to appear in a public place
[51:22.640 --> 51:28.640]  or upon any private property without first having obtained from the owner or tenant consent to do so
[51:28.640 --> 51:34.320]  in writing well okay so if we look at this this raises some interesting questions because when
[51:34.320 --> 51:42.800]  it says it's an intent to conceal his identity it doesn't say criminal intent just intent to conceal
[51:42.800 --> 51:49.360]  so wouldn't that include burkas because with a burka you're trying to conceal your identity right
[51:49.360 --> 51:56.480]  you don't want people to see your face so why wouldn't that statute apply to burkas maybe because
[51:56.480 --> 52:01.360]  the statute says intent to conceal his identity so i guess it's okay for women to conceal their
[52:01.360 --> 52:07.440]  identity i don't know i think that is his in the general sense and that statute but i find that
[52:07.440 --> 52:13.120]  very interesting i think that it should apply to a burka and not just to make up for somebody no
[52:13.120 --> 52:19.600]  matter how bizarre that story is no mention as to what the guy's motives were also as we're looking
[52:19.600 --> 52:26.160]  at some other lighter news here kind of touches back again on the health care issue we have a
[52:26.160 --> 52:31.920]  republican senator pat roberts who is now getting a lot of criticism because he's kind of sarcastically
[52:31.920 --> 52:37.280]  joked when talking about essential health benefits that he wouldn't want to lose his mammograms he
[52:37.280 --> 52:44.880]  probably doesn't want to lose his maternity coverage either as a 60 plus year old male because the
[52:44.880 --> 52:50.320]  government is holding a gun to his head forcing him to buy that saying that that is essential
[52:50.320 --> 52:56.720]  health benefits and then congressman judy chew from california got on twitter and was triggered
[52:56.720 --> 53:02.560]  by this and said cancer is no joke mammograms save lives the same reason we pay for prostate
[53:02.560 --> 53:08.160]  exams and of course i'm sure women are being coerced into paying for prostate exams under
[53:08.160 --> 53:12.480]  obama care as well but i think it's kind of interesting when we look at that because it brings
[53:12.480 --> 53:17.840]  up an interesting point about health care and it's also when we look at mammograms we had this other
[53:17.840 --> 53:22.480]  article that came out over the weekend on drudge report about dogs being taught to detect breast
[53:22.480 --> 53:30.880]  cancer from a bandage that had merely touched the breast of a woman with a tumor so these dogs you
[53:30.880 --> 53:39.440]  just put this clothing on a woman who has cancer and they can detect it with 100 percent reliability
[53:39.440 --> 53:47.200]  let me repeat that 100 percent reliability that is far better than mammograms that have both a far
[53:47.200 --> 53:53.360]  less than 100 accuracy generate both false positives and false negatives in terms of
[53:53.360 --> 53:59.040]  mammograms and the dogs don't give you cancer like radiation can do if you have too many mammograms so
[53:59.040 --> 54:05.200]  there's been a disagreement in the medical community as to not only the efficacy of the
[54:05.200 --> 54:11.680]  mammograms but also the safety of the mammograms but of course when you have this kind of insurance
[54:11.680 --> 54:16.320]  coverage everybody's getting them because hey it's free and the hospitals say we want you to
[54:16.320 --> 54:20.880]  have this done because it's another way that they can make money see that's part of the problem
[54:20.880 --> 54:25.520]  with health insurance folks remember it was a couple of years ago that the la times i referred
[54:25.520 --> 54:32.080]  to this before they ran an article and they looked at the cost of people who had who were
[54:32.080 --> 54:37.920]  cash patients versus the cost of people who had health insurance but they went to the same hospitals
[54:37.920 --> 54:41.760]  had the same kind of procedures and they paid they're deductible and guess what the cash patients
[54:41.760 --> 54:46.240]  paid less and one of the reasons for that is because they negotiated with the hospitals but
[54:46.240 --> 54:51.280]  the other part of it is that they're not paying for a lot of unnecessary testing which they will
[54:51.280 --> 54:58.400]  load up on you and i gotta say that not only mammograms but i had uh it had life altering
[54:59.200 --> 55:04.160]  consequences for my mother when she had a diagnostic procedure that caused her to have a stroke
[55:05.520 --> 55:10.080]  there's a heart catheterization and she didn't feel that it was necessary and it wasn't necessary
[55:10.080 --> 55:14.800]  at the time and the doctor even admitted that privately to us because we did not get into a
[55:14.800 --> 55:19.440]  situation where we sued him she was advanced in age at the time but she had that stroke
[55:19.440 --> 55:25.600]  while they were doing the procedure to her to her blocked off the uh the arterial flow
[55:25.600 --> 55:32.000]  caused her to have a stroke but the bottom line folks is that tests have consequences
[55:33.040 --> 55:38.000]  heart catheterizations have consequences mammograms have consequences they're not only expensive but
[55:38.000 --> 55:41.760]  you ought to think about whether you really need those things and they don't push them on you to
[55:41.760 --> 55:46.400]  that extent if you are a cash patient and i say i'm a cash patient i'm a member of samaritan
[55:46.400 --> 55:51.120]  ministries of course there's a lot of these uh there's uh christian care medicare there's liberty
[55:51.120 --> 55:56.080]  we don't have to be a christian these are situations where you share each other's health care where you
[55:56.080 --> 56:01.760]  have a catastrophic insurance policy to fall back on if it's like $50,000 or more but you can then
[56:01.760 --> 56:07.920]  negotiate it's a little bit of a marketplace this is why we're talking about a repeal of obama care
[56:07.920 --> 56:13.920]  getting rid of these mandates and i spend so much time on this because i'm really sad to see the
[56:13.920 --> 56:19.360]  direction this is taking according to some of the headlines the fact that trump and bannon are so
[56:19.360 --> 56:25.120]  angry about this failing that they are now starting to turn their anger on other republicans we
[56:25.120 --> 56:32.000]  don't want to have a civil war over this that's exactly what mccain would love to see especially
[56:32.000 --> 56:38.880]  he's gloating about in the european union when he's talking to them at brussels we don't want to see
[56:38.880 --> 56:44.720]  that happen that's going to not only keep us from getting anything done it will completely lock the
[56:44.720 --> 56:50.320]  republicans up and fighting each other we share the same goal i think the strategy was flawed i
[56:50.320 --> 56:54.640]  think the tactics were horrible the fact that they were changing things up to the last minute the
[56:54.640 --> 57:00.320]  fact that paul ryan had this bill as a secret bill he's the guy if you want to blame somebody
[57:00.320 --> 57:05.120]  blame him he didn't want this to pass in the first place and it was quite obvious we couldn't tell
[57:05.120 --> 57:10.320]  up to the last minute whether veterans are going to be made ineligible to receive tax credits under
[57:10.320 --> 57:16.240]  the revision of the plan they wanted to rush this thing through nobody wanted to see that happen
[57:16.240 --> 57:21.520]  and they didn't address the fundamental things at the bottom of it that were dictatorial if you
[57:21.520 --> 57:26.720]  want to blame somebody blame those tactics those strategies take a look at what happened with it
[57:27.360 --> 57:31.920]  talk to the other side come back you can pass this without the democrats the democrats can't
[57:31.920 --> 57:37.840]  block it but you can block it if you go into a civil war with other republicans stay with us when
[57:37.840 --> 57:41.760]  we come right back we're going to talk about north dakota and the second amendment we're also going
[57:41.760 --> 57:46.320]  to have alex jones talking to us at six after he's going to give exclusive response to the

[1:00:27.680 --> 1:00:35.680]  we are they they are the dark
[1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:39.680]  the dark murdering armies was only on the
[1:00:39.680 --> 1:00:51.680]  the answer to 1984
[1:00:51.680 --> 1:01:02.000]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:05.920]  welcome back to the alex jones show on this sunday march 26 2017
[1:01:05.920 --> 1:01:09.600]  i'm david knight and as i said uh as we're going to break
[1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:14.240]  we've got some important news about the second amendment this is a story that's on info wars
[1:01:14.240 --> 1:01:19.520]  dot com is originally from bright part north dakota says the second amendment is your concealed
[1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:25.520]  carry permit and they're absolutely right they you must have a valid id and notify law enforcement
[1:01:25.520 --> 1:01:30.240]  of the weapon during instances such as a traffic stop but other than that you don't need to get
[1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:36.800]  permission say it's a god-given right to protect yourself and it's not given by the constitution
[1:01:36.800 --> 1:01:42.560]  even the constitution recognizes your god-given rights and the bill of rights and then it has
[1:01:42.560 --> 1:01:47.120]  prohibitions throughout the constitution so that the government can't take away those god-given
[1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:52.880]  rights and the way they take them away is by turning them into privileges privileges
[1:01:53.840 --> 1:01:57.200]  i mean there's a lot of different ways that they can do that i remember when i had a business
[1:01:57.840 --> 1:02:01.200]  i first started my business and i found that i had to get a privilege license
[1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:08.640]  i said isn't that interesting i have to get a i say privilege to start a business but
[1:02:08.640 --> 1:02:15.360]  other people have a right to welfare isn't that interesting it all is in the terminology isn't
[1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:19.200]  it folks i talk about privilege of course now if you're white you're privileged and you got to get
[1:02:19.200 --> 1:02:25.680]  special permission to even open your mouth uh from the leftists but this is also important
[1:02:25.680 --> 1:02:29.360]  this house bill when it was put up listen to the vote margins that they had there
[1:02:29.360 --> 1:02:36.480]  in north dakota it passed the house by 83 to 9 to say that the constitution is your concealed
[1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:43.360]  carry permit second amendment that passed by 83 to 9 in the house it passed by 34 to 13 in the senate
[1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:51.280]  so it was nearly unanimous in the house and it was almost three to one in the senate that's great
[1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:57.600]  news folks great news and i think it's a pattern that we need to see happening elsewhere not just
[1:02:57.600 --> 1:03:03.280]  on the second amendment but on all of our freedoms i think we need to take our freedoms back at the
[1:03:03.280 --> 1:03:08.480]  state level you're not going to have somebody in washington give that up it's washington that's
[1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:13.920]  taking them it's washington it's the swamp that's not only draining your pocketbook but the swamp
[1:03:13.920 --> 1:03:19.600]  is draining your freedoms draining your liberty so you're not going to have them give this up
[1:03:19.600 --> 1:03:26.240]  you're going to take it back state by state by exercising the constitution exercising your
[1:03:26.240 --> 1:03:33.200]  sovereignty and washington is basically gone you gotta forget it folks you've got the as i
[1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:37.280]  pointed out before the congress has abdicated its authority to make laws to the bureaucracy all they
[1:03:37.280 --> 1:03:45.280]  do is create a new bureaucracy or they create a sweeping bank reform from dodd and frank and turn
[1:03:45.280 --> 1:03:49.280]  this over to some newly created institution and they will go in and create all the rules and
[1:03:49.280 --> 1:03:54.800]  regulations and laws and they will assess fines and penalties against you and all the protections
[1:03:54.800 --> 1:03:59.840]  of the bill of rights will not apply the presumption of innocence does not apply to their regulatory
[1:03:59.840 --> 1:04:05.440]  law the idea that you're going to have a trial before they assess a penalty that doesn't apply
[1:04:05.440 --> 1:04:11.120]  they say that it is a civil action and they can take from you immediately whatever they wish you
[1:04:11.120 --> 1:04:16.720]  have to prove that you're innocent you have to sue them to get your property back and the prohibition
[1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:21.120]  against excessive fines they say well that doesn't apply either because this is civil not criminal
[1:04:21.760 --> 1:04:25.520]  and that's what they do with the war on drugs the civil asset forfeiture so the way we're
[1:04:25.520 --> 1:04:32.080]  going to take this stuff back is state by state issue by issue it has to be done at the state
[1:04:32.080 --> 1:04:38.240]  level and this situation in north dakota is exactly exactly the way it has to happen now
[1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:42.240]  coming up next we're going to have alex jones this is going to be his exclusive response to the
[1:04:42.240 --> 1:04:47.600]  firestorm concerning this pizza gate statement that he made on friday he'll be right back with
[1:04:47.600 --> 1:05:02.000]  the rest of the story stay with us appearing on the drug report this morning but
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:07.280]  potential smoking gun showed obama administration despite on trump team source says republican
[1:05:07.280 --> 1:05:12.560]  congressional investigators expect a potential smoking gun establishing that the obama administration
[1:05:12.560 --> 1:05:17.440]  despite on the trump transition team and possibly the president elect himself intelligence committee
[1:05:17.440 --> 1:05:22.400]  chair david newness from california has said he expects that the nsa will provide him this smoking
[1:05:22.400 --> 1:05:27.360]  gun evidence the intelligence has said to leave no doubt that the obama administration in its closing
[1:05:27.360 --> 1:05:32.560]  days was using the cover of legitimate surveillance on foreign targets to spy on president elect trump
[1:05:32.560 --> 1:05:37.360]  according to sources and basically it boils down to this while it's legal for the deep state to
[1:05:37.360 --> 1:05:43.040]  collect intelligence on foreign targets it's not legal for the names of us citizens to be unmasked
[1:05:43.040 --> 1:05:47.520]  this was done and was disseminated through intelligence reports now looking back at trump's
[1:05:47.520 --> 1:05:53.600]  march fourth wiretapping tweets it seems he was right all along soon we will find out if obama
[1:05:53.600 --> 1:05:58.640]  administration officials are too big to jail rob do reporting for info wars dot com and info wars
[1:05:58.640 --> 1:06:12.160]  nightly news we now take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of the resistance
[1:06:12.160 --> 1:06:25.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show on friday i issued a statement on info wars dot com but also
[1:06:25.280 --> 1:06:33.760]  broadcast on my daily show basically clarifying my position concerning what has become known as the
[1:06:33.760 --> 1:06:40.960]  pizza gate controversy and apologizing to james aliphonus of comet ping pong pizza in dc now why
[1:06:40.960 --> 1:06:48.240]  did i do that because i am preparing to go on the offense against real child traffickers
[1:06:48.240 --> 1:06:56.080]  and those abusing children and because going back to december first of last year i have told my
[1:06:56.080 --> 1:07:05.280]  crew at info wars that i believed this to be a manufactured controversy by msm to discredit
[1:07:05.280 --> 1:07:12.400]  those researching and exposing the epidemic across the world of powerful elites and others
[1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:20.160]  abusing and exploiting children so please take notes and research for yourself the bombshell
[1:07:20.160 --> 1:07:31.040]  information i'm about to cover in early november of 2016 we began to get exclusive information
[1:07:31.040 --> 1:07:38.560]  from law enforcement giving us tips into open source areas to research and it dealt with the
[1:07:38.560 --> 1:07:45.040]  clinton's and with prominent members of the democratic party admittedly going to allister
[1:07:45.040 --> 1:07:51.040]  crowley events and uh... the bizarre information inside the wiki leaks emails we didn't know
[1:07:51.040 --> 1:07:57.440]  exactly what to make of it but our law enforcement sources in new york and new jersey said watch
[1:07:57.440 --> 1:08:04.640]  anthony wiener is going to be investigated for child porn on his phone and contacting minors
[1:08:04.640 --> 1:08:10.400]  we were the first to report that because we had sources but before we could get all that
[1:08:10.400 --> 1:08:16.880]  information looked at suddenly people on online message boards and forums began to get distracted
[1:08:16.880 --> 1:08:24.320]  to a pizza place in dc then msnbc cnn you name it the washington post new york times
[1:08:24.320 --> 1:08:30.080]  they focused on comic ping pong because there have been code words in new york concerning pizza
[1:08:30.080 --> 1:08:34.800]  that law enforcement was saying was connected to possible child pornography and trafficking
[1:08:35.680 --> 1:08:42.080]  that was separate so msn began to focus on a pizza place that did have some prominent democrats
[1:08:42.080 --> 1:08:48.880]  going to it what we now know is an attempt to distract everyone on to the probably completely
[1:08:48.880 --> 1:08:55.200]  innocent pizza place away from the bombshell information unfolding in new york and other
[1:08:55.200 --> 1:09:01.360]  areas so as soon as i began to figure that out long before i was attacked in msn for covering it
[1:09:01.360 --> 1:09:07.200]  long before mr aliphonus sent me a letter just a month ago saying he liked me to retract i clicked
[1:09:07.200 --> 1:09:14.480]  to it why was everybody focusing on this pizza place and not on all the incredible bombshells
[1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:22.400]  we saw happening in new york hawaii california you name it so to be clear the reason i put this
[1:09:22.400 --> 1:09:27.760]  letter out to mr aliphonus is because i believe he and his employees are innocent people and have
[1:09:27.760 --> 1:09:32.720]  been sucked into this just like i've been sucked into it and if msn would just be honest they could
[1:09:32.720 --> 1:09:38.160]  track back and see this for themselves but regardless i did this because it's the right
[1:09:38.160 --> 1:09:44.800]  thing to do just like by december 1st i clicked to what was going on and have been proven right
[1:09:44.800 --> 1:09:51.840]  yet again so let's walk through the atmosphere and the news that we were looking at in november
[1:09:51.840 --> 1:09:57.040]  and december and why there was so much hysteria concerning what was happening in the washington
[1:09:57.040 --> 1:10:09.200]  dc area in early december i distanced myself my crew and info wars dot com from the entire
[1:10:09.200 --> 1:10:16.720]  pizza gate narrative because i realized it was distracting from hardcore confirmed news reports
[1:10:16.720 --> 1:10:24.880]  of children being abused and sexually assaulted on a mass scale i distanced myself from it because
[1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:32.000]  it was clearly a contrived distraction from the real crimes taking place less than a day and a
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:37.760]  half after putting out my clarification slash retraction thousands of publications hundreds
[1:10:37.760 --> 1:10:43.760]  of tv stations and major networks have picked up my retraction many of them twisting it it'll
[1:10:43.760 --> 1:10:49.840]  be interesting to see even the interest of children they actually report now on what we're about to
[1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:57.360]  break down here's a headline out of town hall why the msm is ignoring trump's sex trafficking bust
[1:10:57.360 --> 1:11:03.120]  that are massive we're going to get to that here in just a few minutes but first let's look at some
[1:11:03.120 --> 1:11:09.280]  of the things that have happened in just the last few years of why when we saw the podesta emails come
[1:11:09.280 --> 1:11:15.120]  out in new york and when law enforcement was telling us they were investigating it for code words
[1:11:15.120 --> 1:11:21.680]  and connection to child abuse very very serious alleged child abuse uh that we took it so seriously
[1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:27.200]  here's some of the headlines with people associated with the clinton's jeffrey eppstein the billionaire
[1:11:27.200 --> 1:11:33.200]  pedophile convicted with links to bill clinton kevin spacey robert maxwell and prince andrew
[1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:39.200]  and there's more coming up the sex slave scandal that exposed pedophile billionaire jeffrey eppstein
[1:11:40.240 --> 1:11:44.480]  that's who bill clinton and others are flying around with going to this pedophile island all
[1:11:44.480 --> 1:11:52.480]  this is happening it ties into the same usual suspects uh we've got savel in england again
[1:11:52.480 --> 1:11:58.560]  tied to the royal family and all the massive admitted sex abuse uh going on there including
[1:11:58.560 --> 1:12:04.800]  satanism alistair crowley stuff we've got laura sillsby who works for the or did work for the
[1:12:04.800 --> 1:12:11.600]  clinton foundation convicted of smuggling out children from haydie and that ties into all
[1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:16.960]  the news headlines we're seeing right now about all the missing kids in dc that's why people are so
[1:12:16.960 --> 1:12:22.640]  concerned of course remember in the wiki leaks spirit cooking clinton campaign chairman practices
[1:12:22.640 --> 1:12:30.320]  bizarre cult ritual that the high priestess admits is alistair crowley black magic using blood semen
[1:12:31.280 --> 1:12:36.480]  breastmilk you name it and this is the type of stuff that was going on in new york with
[1:12:36.480 --> 1:12:42.880]  pedesta in the emails anthony wiener connected to it umma abedin you name it law enforcement begs
[1:12:42.880 --> 1:12:48.960]  the world read hillary's emails to find child rape evidence kit daniels november 5th before it
[1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:54.640]  was anywhere that wiener was being investigated for sexting underage people or child porn that's
[1:12:54.640 --> 1:13:01.920]  in the article from our law enforcement sources talking about anthony wiener so this is the climate
[1:13:01.920 --> 1:13:07.040]  this is the climate with the wiki leaks with the information with all this coming out with
[1:13:08.240 --> 1:13:14.160]  downing street and scotland yard saying national pedophile scandal at the highest levels of
[1:13:14.160 --> 1:13:20.320]  government may bring down the whole country a giant pedophile networks in control we're reading
[1:13:20.320 --> 1:13:26.240]  this in major newspapers than seeing it in wiki leaks and trying to investigate it police launch
[1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:33.280]  criminal investigation into mp's child sex ring jimmy savel was part of satanic ring children
[1:13:33.280 --> 1:13:39.760]  dying the sex with dead children uh satanic rituals royal family mainstream news folks
[1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:45.680]  then trump gets in just as we've been told by law enforcement he was planning to go after him
[1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:52.000]  474 arrested 28 sexually exploited children rescued in bondage during statewide human
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:59.200]  trafficking operation that was february 1st we told you those busts were coming so now you know
[1:13:59.200 --> 1:14:04.000]  i'm not going to let the media because some internet trolls focused on some pizza place
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:11.760]  distract serious investigations away from what's really happening and give real networks to cover
[1:14:11.760 --> 1:14:17.280]  they're looking for to demonize the idea that any children are being exploited that any children
[1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:21.760]  are being kidnapped that any children are being raped that any children are being killed when we
[1:14:21.760 --> 1:14:26.160]  know this has come out tens of thousands of times and that's what the media has done now
[1:14:26.160 --> 1:14:31.600]  i see them ridiculing people claiming the catholic church has abused or raped kids or covered it up
[1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:37.040]  i'm now hearing forget what happened with penn state and sandusky and now his son being arrested
[1:14:37.040 --> 1:14:44.080]  i'm hearing just it doesn't exist the exploitation of children is a conspiracy theory while nambla
[1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:50.880]  the north american manboy love association has been accepted by the un as an NGO and now left
[1:14:50.880 --> 1:14:58.000]  as groups even salon are pushing saying legalized pedophilia the very groups that criticize us and
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:07.520]  say it doesn't exist now you begin to see exactly why early on i clicked weeks into it exactly what
[1:15:07.520 --> 1:15:13.760]  was happening look at these headlines after exposure of pedophiles bbc star probe widens the uk
[1:15:13.760 --> 1:15:19.680]  parliament missing black girls in dc sparks outrage prompts calls for federal help the police say
[1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:24.400]  black girls are getting grabbed off the street but a week later the news says conspiracy theory
[1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:29.440]  they all ran away well let's say most of them ran away what happened to all the others but they
[1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:34.560]  always say it's a runaway don't think again to be clear it doesn't take a rocket scientist to
[1:15:34.560 --> 1:15:38.800]  understand this you just got to pull back and look at all the evidence and everything that's
[1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:45.200]  happening to see how clear it is and by late november i was already telling crew this is a
[1:15:45.200 --> 1:15:52.400]  honeypot it's a distraction from all the real admitted stuff with haydie and epstein and and
[1:15:52.400 --> 1:16:00.640]  the clinton's and the un and people working for the foundation i am very proud to announce the

[1:19:28.720 --> 1:19:33.760]  recapture that everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal you used the meat for
[1:19:33.760 --> 1:19:39.680]  sustenance the fat for cooking but you used the bones for strength from the outside structure full
[1:19:39.680 --> 1:19:44.800]  of minerals and kiko factors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body this is the engine
[1:19:44.800 --> 1:19:50.080]  of the life essence i'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were but i'm sure as hell trying to

[1:20:12.320 --> 1:20:17.120]  to pull back and look at all the evidence and everything that's happening to see how clear it
[1:20:17.120 --> 1:20:23.360]  is and by late november i was already telling crew this is a honeypot it's a distraction
[1:20:24.240 --> 1:20:32.720]  from all the real admitted stuff with haydie and epstein and and the clinton's and the un and people
[1:20:32.720 --> 1:20:38.640]  working for the foundation being convicted of child trafficking and then boom sure enough
[1:20:39.200 --> 1:20:44.320]  by the middle of december after i'd already completely distance ourselves from this and
[1:20:44.320 --> 1:20:50.320]  had been the first in the alternative news community to say this is wrong this comet ping pong thing
[1:20:50.320 --> 1:21:00.080]  is a distraction we got singled out by meghan kelly on foxnish mpr you name it by editing clips
[1:21:00.080 --> 1:21:04.240]  of where i was sitting to our audience i don't know about sex rings i don't know about hillary
[1:21:04.240 --> 1:21:08.800]  actually being involved in that but funding libya funding the syrian invasion killed hundreds of
[1:21:08.800 --> 1:21:13.920]  thousands of people tens of thousands of kids and even top lawyers say she's a war criminal
[1:21:13.920 --> 1:21:19.360]  and bragged about all the things she did in libya and madeline all bright and the 500 000 dead kids
[1:21:19.360 --> 1:21:26.560]  so right there isn't just child abuse it's child murder kill the red clinton is one of the most
[1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:34.640]  vicious serial killers the planet's ever seen there's a twist to that am i talking about the
[1:21:34.640 --> 1:21:40.000]  devil worship story with her chief of staff or campaign chairman is looking at the menu of blood
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  and seaman and body parts at the allister crowley event the private event oh no i'm not talking about
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:52.640]  that i mean 200 000 plus dead christians with her operation with syria and her operation in libya
[1:21:52.640 --> 1:21:57.360]  and not letting the christians get out and directing al qaeda and ices who target and murder
[1:21:57.360 --> 1:22:02.160]  children and put them through sex slavery and throw catholic priest off cliffs and kill people in
[1:22:02.160 --> 1:22:07.360]  mass and murder gays and everything else you can imagine because they don't like peaceful people
[1:22:08.240 --> 1:22:13.520]  and they caught everybody there for open society and they love everybody anything they do is for
[1:22:13.520 --> 1:22:22.000]  degradation info wars alex jones a far right web host posted a youtube video seen almost 500 000
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:41.040]  times so you just saw it for yourself we clearly were talking about libya and syria but they think
[1:22:41.040 --> 1:22:48.240]  you're so stupid they took it and broadcasted again saying that i was saying hillary was
[1:22:48.240 --> 1:22:54.240]  torturing people in the bottom of the dc pizza place now that makes me look bad that makes people
[1:22:54.240 --> 1:23:00.720]  on the street mad at me and also a lot of folks don't trust msm so they use my credibility twisted
[1:23:00.720 --> 1:23:07.200]  on fox news on mpr and a bunch of other channels to have me say that it was literally happening
[1:23:07.200 --> 1:23:13.600]  when i didn't to then actually create more hysteria and send more people to go to comet ping pong
[1:23:13.600 --> 1:23:19.760]  see how that works they edit what i say rebroadcast it then the controversy only gets worse
[1:23:19.760 --> 1:23:24.800]  and they blame me in the independent press and then call for censorship and the shutdown of
[1:23:24.800 --> 1:23:32.320]  our free society now of the hundreds of publications that openly lied and said that i said that hillary
[1:23:32.320 --> 1:23:38.080]  was torturing people uh in the bottom of a non-existent basement only the washington post as bad as
[1:23:38.080 --> 1:23:42.880]  they are told the truth now they quoted me out of context instead that i said hillary was killing
[1:23:42.880 --> 1:23:49.280]  kids but then they said he later tied it back to syria no i did it in the same one minute clip
[1:23:49.280 --> 1:23:53.840]  you've already seen that's why they always only put audio up on screen and not video because it
[1:23:53.840 --> 1:23:58.720]  looks so edited if they actually show the chopped up clip but the story where the washington post
[1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:05.840]  got it right was pizza gate from rumor to hashtag to gunfire in dc but in this they admit that i was
[1:24:05.840 --> 1:24:12.080]  talking about syria not dc and that's why the public doesn't trust establishment media
[1:24:12.080 --> 1:24:17.120]  that they distort not only did meghan kelly and others take out a context what i was saying about
[1:24:17.120 --> 1:24:22.800]  hillary and her war crimes they then also covered up the fact that i was exposing admitted war
[1:24:22.800 --> 1:24:29.280]  crimes where madeline albright admitted that 500 000 iraqi children died under her bill clinton
[1:24:29.280 --> 1:24:34.480]  hillary clinton sanctions that that was okay we have heard that a half a million children have died
[1:24:34.480 --> 1:24:43.600]  i mean that's more children than died when went in hiroshima and and you know is the price worth it
[1:24:44.480 --> 1:24:50.560]  i think this is a very hard choice but the price we think the price is worth it and of course
[1:24:50.560 --> 1:24:55.680]  hillary making jokes about what happened with the massive deaths that took place when she launched
[1:24:55.680 --> 1:25:00.560]  that entire operation that created a felt state in libya so i mean that is the land of
[1:25:00.560 --> 1:25:08.640]  unconfirmed yes we came we saw he died didn't have anything to do with your visit no i'm sure
[1:25:10.560 --> 1:25:15.440]  so if they don't care about all these kids being enslaved by isis and al-qaeda they don't care about
[1:25:15.440 --> 1:25:20.160]  them being killed then how do you think they don't care about kids in haydy or other places this
[1:25:20.160 --> 1:25:28.800]  illustrates how cold blooded these people are in closing my entire system my entire economy
[1:25:28.800 --> 1:25:36.000]  is about being genuine and telling the truth i said there were no wnds in iraq in 2003 i told you
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:41.280]  donald trump was going to win the election the polls were fake i told you that household appliances
[1:25:41.920 --> 1:25:47.200]  were having spy systems put into them 15 years ago because i have the schematics it's now on the news
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:54.720]  the truth is ladies and gentlemen we're cutting edge we're trailblazers at info wars and my whole
[1:25:54.720 --> 1:25:59.440]  world is about telling the truth and being honest and having integrity and that's why
[1:25:59.440 --> 1:26:08.240]  when i saw us being sucked in to msm picking up the most obscure rumors online and magnifying it
[1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:15.360]  and i saw us then reporting on it i had everything we'd put up removed because i didn't want to add
[1:26:15.360 --> 1:26:21.120]  fuel to the fire and i went on tv and the radio in early december and i told our listeners it was
[1:26:21.120 --> 1:26:28.880]  distraction but of course msm is still out there lying claiming that i just retracted all of this
[1:26:29.760 --> 1:26:36.320]  because aliphana sent me a letter no i openly officially retracted and apologized because
[1:26:36.320 --> 1:26:42.640]  that's a way of clearly cutting off the lies saying that i'm promoting this damn thing
[1:26:42.640 --> 1:26:49.600]  when since december first i've been publicly against it and i can sleep good at night knowing
[1:26:49.600 --> 1:26:54.640]  that all of that will come out when there's a true investigation or if there's any court action
[1:26:55.920 --> 1:27:01.280]  i stand on the truth and nothing more and i'm not going to let the exploiters of children
[1:27:01.920 --> 1:27:07.760]  like mr eppstein and bill clinton who's clearly involved and others sit there and distract and
[1:27:07.760 --> 1:27:15.600]  divert to a lower politico who i believe they've been using all along just like they've been using
[1:27:15.600 --> 1:27:22.800]  me and that's why i'm angry and that's why i'm speaking out and that's why i'm telling the truth
[1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:28.560]  about what happened to some of our viewers and others the abuse of children exploitation and
[1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:35.680]  their sexual abuse is very serious so when you go with half-baked conspiracies and when you run
[1:27:35.680 --> 1:27:40.320]  around and say that i'm covering all this up because i'm trying to actually go for the truth
[1:27:40.320 --> 1:27:46.960]  you add to the hysteria and you create a smoke screen that distracts from the real bonafide
[1:27:46.960 --> 1:27:52.880]  meat and potatoes issues that we can prove and then that gives political cover to the real
[1:27:52.880 --> 1:28:00.000]  child abusers that are there that said though we're going to start making a major concerted
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:06.160]  professional focus on the exploitation of children sex trafficking or more we've always done it but
[1:28:06.160 --> 1:28:13.280]  now we have a true duty to make this our focus to go after the real research and the real court
[1:28:13.280 --> 1:28:19.360]  cases and the real admissions that are there so to all the pedophiles and all the scum and all the
[1:28:19.360 --> 1:28:25.840]  controllers out there who think that they're going to use these distractions and these mainstream
[1:28:25.840 --> 1:28:33.520]  media lies to to to to have a smoke screen to abuse children info wars is going on the offensive
[1:28:33.520 --> 1:28:38.960]  against the organizations that are known and documented like the united nations and others
[1:28:38.960 --> 1:28:43.120]  to be involved in this and i want to ask our viewers and listeners to understand it is now
[1:28:43.120 --> 1:28:47.600]  more important than ever that you go out and continue your important research give your eyes
[1:28:47.600 --> 1:28:50.800]  and ears open i'm alex jones and this is the info war

[1:33:33.520 --> 1:33:38.560]  welcome back to the alex jones show this sunday march 26 2017 i'm david night
[1:33:38.560 --> 1:33:41.600]  we're gonna talk about uber and we're gonna talk about their surveillance tape because that's the
[1:33:41.600 --> 1:33:46.800]  background of this folks that and agenda 21 that's what this is all about and of course there was
[1:33:46.800 --> 1:33:51.280]  just this accident with uber but before we do i'm just looking at the screen here the drug
[1:33:51.280 --> 1:33:57.840]  reports got the top of the trumped court democrats and is now opening the door to them well why not
[1:33:57.840 --> 1:34:04.080]  because of course he worked with the establishment gop and paul ryan who is on the same track as
[1:34:04.080 --> 1:34:11.120]  the democrats driving the titanic health care into the iceberg as they come out and say we're
[1:34:11.120 --> 1:34:14.400]  going to rearrange a few of the deck chairs here don't worry we're going to rearrange some deck
[1:34:14.400 --> 1:34:18.960]  chairs or we don't even know if they're going to do that but look as i said before and we've got
[1:34:19.840 --> 1:34:26.240]  somebody from the house uh freedom caucus is now abandoned it we have congressman po is now out of
[1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:30.400]  the house freedom caucus because the heat has gotten too much for him you know we don't need
[1:34:30.400 --> 1:34:36.080]  sunshine patriots like po we need some winter soldiers who will declare their intention every
[1:34:36.080 --> 1:34:41.840]  time i criticize something like this which i think it's a bad strategy a bad tactic i think
[1:34:41.840 --> 1:34:46.000]  trump's goal is still get rid of obama care but i think the tactic and the strategy was bad
[1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:50.880]  i think he allied himself with the wrong people he should have allied himself with paul ryan
[1:34:50.880 --> 1:34:55.440]  he should have allied himself with the house freedom caucus and people who really understood
[1:34:55.440 --> 1:34:59.840]  what the issue was here every time i say that i hear people say well he's playing four-dimensional
[1:34:59.840 --> 1:35:06.160]  chess maybe i would like to see somebody that is honestly going to declare the principles and the
[1:35:06.160 --> 1:35:12.400]  intentions and is going to sign really large their john hand cock in defiance of these kings
[1:35:12.400 --> 1:35:17.920]  and dictators instead of enthroning somebody like a health and human secretary to set there
[1:35:17.920 --> 1:35:23.520]  and decide for us what our health care is going to be that's what obama care did along with the
[1:35:23.520 --> 1:35:28.080]  mandates of what you have to buy along with the taxes that they impose on you they established a king
[1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:32.880]  with hhs to tell you what your health care is going to be that needs to be repealed
[1:35:32.880 --> 1:35:38.240]  that has to be taken off you cannot have that you can't use that as an instrument of reform
[1:35:38.240 --> 1:35:44.880]  reform begins by getting rid of the king of health care the health czar get rid of that office nobody
[1:35:44.880 --> 1:35:48.240]  should have that kind of power that's why you shouldn't have a department of education look
[1:35:48.240 --> 1:35:53.040]  at what it's done to us we got to fight with it all the time now about common core that'll never end
[1:35:53.040 --> 1:35:57.600]  about tranny bathrooms about every kind and what has happened to the quality of our education
[1:35:57.600 --> 1:36:01.120]  same thing's going to happen to our quality of our health care the cost of our health care the cost
[1:36:01.120 --> 1:36:06.480]  of our education the department of education was created by jimmy carter ronald reagan campaign on
[1:36:06.480 --> 1:36:12.480]  getting rid of it instead he grew it he grew it and this is a giant monster that is taken over
[1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:17.680]  our society our education our budgets and the same thing is going to be happening with health care
[1:36:18.640 --> 1:36:23.840]  you're not going to fix this by having a czar come in and take away certain things and turn
[1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:28.640]  them over to others it's just fundamentally wrong and to come in and say well i'm going to throw the
[1:36:28.640 --> 1:36:32.720]  the people who stood on principle under the bus and i'm going to ally myself with the democrats
[1:36:32.720 --> 1:36:38.400]  that is moving in the wrong direction folks i'm sorry sorry but that is moving in the wrong
[1:36:38.400 --> 1:36:43.600]  direction uh before we go back to uh what's happening with the self-driving cars i just
[1:36:43.600 --> 1:36:48.480]  want to point out to you that we now have back in stock super blue fluoride free toothpaste
[1:36:48.480 --> 1:36:53.200]  that's now back in stock i pointed out that we have brain force plus at 25 off those are my
[1:36:53.200 --> 1:36:57.840]  two favorite products because of both of them i can really immediately feel the difference i know
[1:36:57.840 --> 1:37:03.360]  certain supplements i can look up selenium i know that that is something that a lot of studies have
[1:37:03.360 --> 1:37:08.960]  shown that helps your health it helps to uh they they've got epidemiological studies that show
[1:37:08.960 --> 1:37:13.680]  that people take selenium have lower incidence of certain types of diseases and so forth and so
[1:37:13.680 --> 1:37:16.640]  you take things like that those supplements that you know are good for you because you've
[1:37:16.640 --> 1:37:20.800]  done the research but you're not going to feel anything but i feel something when i take brain
[1:37:20.800 --> 1:37:28.960]  force i can feel it working on me in a good way and i feel in a good way the fluoride free toothpaste
[1:37:28.960 --> 1:37:36.000]  it freshens your mouth the brain force plus freshens your brain and it's very important for you to
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:43.360]  have a toothpaste that is going to fight bacteria gum disease because that leads to heart disease
[1:37:43.360 --> 1:37:48.240]  it's very serious and you want to keep your mind sharp as well but so both of those products now
[1:37:48.240 --> 1:37:53.200]  we have uh the toothpaste back in stock at info wars life dot com we have brain force plus at 25
[1:37:53.200 --> 1:37:58.960]  percent off and of course uh the toothpaste has iodine nano silver peppermint oil that's one of
[1:37:58.960 --> 1:38:05.040]  the reasons why it fights bacteria that cause gum disease that then causes heart disease also we
[1:38:05.040 --> 1:38:10.640]  have 30 to 40 off info wars select storeable food at info wars star dot com that is for a loaded

[1:39:19.200 --> 1:39:26.000]  newsletter real quickly this picture that was on the top of drudge yesterday the uber car that was
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:31.920]  laying on its side the other car that was damaged we now know that the uber vehicle was not responsible
[1:39:31.920 --> 1:39:37.200]  for the incident the tempe police have said that another car failed to yield for the uber car
[1:39:37.200 --> 1:39:44.480]  okay well in spite of that uber is suspending a self-driving car program after that high impact
[1:39:44.480 --> 1:39:50.800]  crash now there's reasons for that folks first of all they want to tell us that it wasn't their
[1:39:50.800 --> 1:39:55.360]  problem but i've taught my children how to drive and one of the things i tell them is don't ever
[1:39:55.360 --> 1:40:01.360]  trust on having a ride away you always want to be wise and measure what other drivers are doing
[1:40:01.360 --> 1:40:07.600]  because you can wind up being dead right and so to say that it wasn't completely responsible
[1:40:07.600 --> 1:40:13.520]  yes okay fine maybe it wasn't but you can always drive defensively now they say that there was
[1:40:13.520 --> 1:40:20.320]  another person behind the wheel and that's good because we know from ubers on own data
[1:40:20.320 --> 1:40:27.040]  that came out on march 16th recode got some documents from uber and this should be scandalous
[1:40:27.040 --> 1:40:32.160]  like the snowden documents or like vault seven that was released by wiki leaks but nobody has
[1:40:32.160 --> 1:40:38.720]  really reported on this much there's been a little bit of coverage of it in the technology press a
[1:40:38.720 --> 1:40:42.640]  little bit in the automotive press but for the most part people have not talked about
[1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:48.240]  what's really going on with uber now if you think that the uber cars are great i want you to hear
[1:40:48.240 --> 1:40:53.680]  this although uber cars are steadily increasing the number of miles that are driven autonomously
[1:40:53.680 --> 1:40:59.920]  the combination of how many times drivers have to take over and how smoothly the car drives
[1:40:59.920 --> 1:41:04.560]  is not showing much progress they call these things disengagement so when the software
[1:41:04.560 --> 1:41:09.040]  can't handle it and the driver has to take over that's called a disengagement now it can be kind
[1:41:09.040 --> 1:41:15.040]  of minor or it can be very serious this is an article again from recode they got these documents
[1:41:15.040 --> 1:41:20.880]  they obtained these documents these are documents that were circulated throughout ubers self-driving
[1:41:20.880 --> 1:41:25.360]  group now here's the bottom line folks during the week ending march eighth which is the week
[1:41:25.360 --> 1:41:30.960]  before they got these documents the 43 active cars on the road with uber as self-driving cars only
[1:41:30.960 --> 1:41:38.720]  drove an average of close to 0.8 miles before the human driver had to take over for for one reason
[1:41:38.720 --> 1:41:45.120]  or another you understand they can't drive a mile without human intervention now when you look at
[1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:49.280]  something that is very serious and interesting before i move on from that this is the decline
[1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:55.840]  from earlier in the year the end of january that rate was 0.9 miles that the human would have to
[1:41:55.840 --> 1:42:00.400]  take over for the artificial intelligence you want to call it a headless uber it's a mindless
[1:42:00.400 --> 1:42:07.680]  uber it's a mindless uber so they can't even drive a mile without having the driver take over
[1:42:07.680 --> 1:42:11.280]  now when you look at something else like a critical intervention that's defined as
[1:42:11.280 --> 1:42:16.400]  the human driver they call the safety driver yeah okay the human driver had to take over to
[1:42:16.400 --> 1:42:24.240]  avoid harmful events that would result in hitting a pedestrian or causing damage of $5,000 in property
[1:42:24.240 --> 1:42:29.760]  that they estimate well how often did they have to do that remember they couldn't even drive a
[1:42:29.760 --> 1:42:34.000]  mile without the human driver taking over well they were saying that it was between 100 and 200
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:40.960]  miles that they would have a catastrophic accident like $5,000 in damage or hitting a killing a
[1:42:40.960 --> 1:42:48.240]  pedestrian is that acceptable is that better than a drunk driver i don't think so and yet
[1:42:48.240 --> 1:42:52.560]  you've got wired magazine coming out and saying well this is a reminder of why we can't have human
[1:42:52.560 --> 1:42:57.520]  drivers because the human driver was at fault in tempe Arizona they will always be shills
[1:42:57.520 --> 1:43:01.680]  for this surveillance technology stay with us we'll be right back this is alex jones i want to

[1:47:32.080 --> 1:47:37.040]  excerpts from an interview that alex jones had with one of the heroes of Benghazi one of the
[1:47:37.040 --> 1:47:42.000]  survivors of course if you've seen the movie 13 hours you know about this gentleman but it's a
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:45.680]  very good interview i wanted you to hear the beginning of this and of course for the full
[1:47:45.680 --> 1:47:50.240]  interview you'll find on alex jones's youtube channel but i wanted to get this to our sunday
[1:47:50.240 --> 1:47:54.720]  audience because it's a bit different audience so without any further delay here's excerpts from alex
[1:47:54.720 --> 1:48:00.160]  jones's interview with a Benghazi hero i'll take a couple buddies and we'll go grab them bring them
[1:48:00.160 --> 1:48:03.840]  india president trump just give us the word but it needs to happen it does need to happen and i
[1:48:03.840 --> 1:48:08.320]  am in total agreement with you you got to cut the head off of a snake and watch it die and i think
[1:48:08.320 --> 1:48:12.720]  right now that's the head right there is your source it'd be really ridiculous at this point
[1:48:12.720 --> 1:48:17.920]  for them to just hard to start there's some civil war going on i mean you've got guys like myself
[1:48:17.920 --> 1:48:22.720]  you've got plenty of contractors out there that are back home now plenty of person people like
[1:48:22.720 --> 1:48:27.680]  myself that are patriots that that aren't going to stand our side and let some coup if you want
[1:48:27.680 --> 1:48:32.480]  to call it that takeover and again so i just i see there's a lot of a lot of bs a lot of just
[1:48:32.480 --> 1:48:37.280]  a tough talk at this point in time but if it comes to this not going to be tough talk believe me
[1:48:37.280 --> 1:48:42.800]  people like myself will stand up and we'll be coming right back at you so i just warn them don't
[1:48:42.800 --> 1:48:48.400]  just just stop that that that bs and and and put a cork in it right now before it really ends up
[1:48:48.400 --> 1:49:01.120]  getting to something that they really don't want to get into there's so much to talk about the
[1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:04.640]  point is there's a lot of special hunters think this country belongs to them they've overrun it
[1:49:04.640 --> 1:49:09.840]  they've taken control of it but the good news is the sleeping giant that is america of every
[1:49:09.840 --> 1:49:14.800]  race color and creed we're all americans we bleed red blood we're one race on this planet are waking
[1:49:14.800 --> 1:49:20.160]  up to it and it's a beautiful thing uh michael more came out again yesterday and so we need a
[1:49:20.160 --> 1:49:25.520]  civil emergency and to overthrow president trump you see it all over the news killing
[1:49:25.520 --> 1:49:29.440]  have marshal law roseo donnell you have the former deputy head of the defense department
[1:49:29.440 --> 1:49:34.720]  in the news going to the pentagon trying to shop the idea of the military overthrowing the president
[1:49:34.720 --> 1:49:40.400]  that's so illegal folks that it makes my head spin and it's a bunch of foreign interest in the
[1:49:40.400 --> 1:49:45.280]  communist chinese coming in to help censor facebook you cannot make this up so i i just talked to
[1:49:45.280 --> 1:49:49.760]  some military guys i know we happen to know chris tonto peranto of course one of the big heroes and
[1:49:49.760 --> 1:49:55.280]  survivors uh of what happened in ben gazi and of course uh lion eyes properly so in the new film
[1:49:55.280 --> 1:50:00.400]  13 hours it's a big hit and so amazing to ask what do you think we should do well say we support the
[1:50:00.400 --> 1:50:05.440]  president and talk about if they're calling for military operations against the president we're
[1:50:05.440 --> 1:50:10.240]  not calling for anything offensive but we should start a discussion about the left thinking
[1:50:10.240 --> 1:50:14.800]  and sorrows doubling the amount of money uh to these groups to kill cops and burn down cities
[1:50:14.800 --> 1:50:18.320]  they're planning something so so chris we're going to skip this break so you have more time thank you
[1:50:18.320 --> 1:50:23.600]  for joining us and coming on obviously everything you've done chris tonto peranto dot com i've kind
[1:50:23.600 --> 1:50:29.840]  of set the table the last four minutes yeah uh where are we going with this i honestly i think
[1:50:29.840 --> 1:50:35.680]  right now it's just a lot of uh lib live talk i i it'd be really ridiculous at this point for them
[1:50:35.680 --> 1:50:40.720]  to to it's hard to start there's some civil war going on i mean you've got guys like myself you've
[1:50:40.720 --> 1:50:45.680]  got plenty of contractors out there that are back home now plenty of person people like myself
[1:50:45.680 --> 1:50:50.880]  that are patriots that that are going to stand aside and let some coup if you want to call it that
[1:50:50.880 --> 1:50:56.560]  take over um and also just to strengthen numbers and i'll give it to you live you want to come out
[1:50:56.560 --> 1:50:59.680]  you better be a hundred of you against one of me because that's what's going to take and there are a
[1:50:59.680 --> 1:51:05.120]  lot of me's out there so uh i don't think it's realistic i think again it's a lot of threats
[1:51:05.120 --> 1:51:09.600]  and the libs do that they they are a lot of talk when an action comes and it comes actually picking
[1:51:09.600 --> 1:51:15.520]  up a gun and doing something uh i think if they were more inclined to protect this country you
[1:51:15.520 --> 1:51:19.840]  probably see more of them joining the military joining the law enforcement and uh and again so i
[1:51:19.840 --> 1:51:24.640]  just i see there's a lot of a lot of bs a lot of just a tough talk at this point in time but if it
[1:51:24.640 --> 1:51:30.240]  comes to this not going to be tough talk believe me people like myself will stand up and we'll be
[1:51:30.240 --> 1:51:36.240]  coming right back at you so i just warn them don't don't just just stop that that bs and and
[1:51:36.240 --> 1:51:40.080]  put a cork in it right now before it really ends up to getting to something that they really don't
[1:51:40.080 --> 1:51:45.120]  want to get into well chris that's exactly why as this rhetoric heated up i wanted to get you on
[1:51:45.120 --> 1:51:49.440]  because you're somebody with just a few other guys or some of them died unfortunately took on
[1:51:49.440 --> 1:51:54.560]  hundreds and hundreds of people and two different you know major you know battle scenes under 13 hours
[1:51:54.560 --> 1:51:58.720]  of admitted stand down you just have the physical courage and one of the most you know amazing
[1:51:58.720 --> 1:52:03.520]  alamos where some people actually made it out or a 300 where a few people actually made it so
[1:52:03.520 --> 1:52:08.480]  i mean it's beyond that you actually survived at a 300 type uh you know scenario but where it was
[1:52:08.480 --> 1:52:14.720]  just six against 300 or 500 uh but looking at this that's why i wanted to get you to talk about
[1:52:14.720 --> 1:52:19.920]  this as an expert on it uh because they seem confident and i agree it's a lot of talk but
[1:52:19.920 --> 1:52:25.120]  they're really trying to organize it and i understand i understand trump's resistance to
[1:52:25.120 --> 1:52:29.040]  standing up to this because they're making him look like a fascist but when they're openly calling
[1:52:29.040 --> 1:52:33.440]  for his death everywhere and and my death and everybody else and it's just horrible at a certain
[1:52:33.440 --> 1:52:38.000]  point it becomes dereliction of duty if somebody doesn't get indicted if somebody doesn't get in
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:43.360]  trouble you know when when bow wow you know says i want to kidnap and rape and enslave the first
[1:52:43.360 --> 1:52:49.920]  lady or when uh uh you know his his uncle comes out snoop dog and says i want to kill trump put
[1:52:49.920 --> 1:52:54.400]  some music video out we know he's a coward won't do it but he's trying to activate other mentally
[1:52:54.400 --> 1:52:59.360]  ill people so that's why i'm so concerned that's true and you have a good point there and in the
[1:52:59.360 --> 1:53:03.600]  past if you did that then the secret service be knocking at your door and possibly you'd be going
[1:53:03.600 --> 1:53:08.000]  to prison i i think that needs to happen i think it needs to return there needs to there does need
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:13.280]  to be an example set whether it be snoop dog or somebody else out there where you're gonna say
[1:53:13.280 --> 1:53:17.760]  you're gonna kill the president that's a threat that is a terrorist threat at this point and the
[1:53:17.760 --> 1:53:22.400]  secret service fbi local law enforcement somebody needs to be knocking on the doors and pulling
[1:53:22.400 --> 1:53:27.360]  these guys in handcuffs and honestly if if it is a a star and i hate to use the word hollywood
[1:53:27.360 --> 1:53:31.440]  star but if that's what you want to call yourselves the stars you know tmz needs to be there too to
[1:53:31.440 --> 1:53:36.080]  make an example out of you an example needs to be made and and i don't have a problem of trump
[1:53:36.080 --> 1:53:40.240]  decided to do that he shouldn't be called the fastest that that's the one you don't threaten
[1:53:40.240 --> 1:53:43.360]  to kill the president of the united states you don't do that in the past you've never done it
[1:53:43.360 --> 1:53:49.040]  if you do do it there are repercussions to it and i i think he he does at this point in time or
[1:53:49.040 --> 1:53:54.240]  somebody within the just session somebody within the doj needs to take this upon themselves
[1:53:54.240 --> 1:53:58.800]  and and go ahead and do the right thing and arrest somebody make an example out of somebody and make
[1:53:58.800 --> 1:54:04.080]  it a public example and you know if we'll see what happens but you can't keep letting it go you're
[1:54:04.080 --> 1:54:08.160]  correct it's you've got to lance that blister eventually if not it's going to get infected
[1:54:08.160 --> 1:54:11.920]  you got to do it and if you don't it's just going to get worse and worse and worse so i
[1:54:11.920 --> 1:54:15.920]  i do agree i do agree at this point with the threats to the president but again do i think
[1:54:15.920 --> 1:54:19.440]  that they're going to come out and actually start an all-out war a civil war in the united states of
[1:54:19.440 --> 1:54:26.000]  america they'd be well-earned to not do that i mean i've shown i mean i totally agree with what
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:31.440]  you're saying about the battle space we have the right we're americans 99 percent of the patriots
[1:54:31.440 --> 1:54:36.000]  are you know obviously with the president he's executing like no president have seen on his
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:40.160]  promises it's almost unbelievable it's so good and so it'd be one thing if he was like selling us
[1:54:40.160 --> 1:54:44.160]  out the farm powers or something and that brings us to the next point what do you make of now
[1:54:44.160 --> 1:54:48.560]  newness coming on signal they were surveilling him basically illegally the surveillance was legal
[1:54:48.560 --> 1:54:52.560]  because it was overseas but they were using it domestically the democratic party during the
[1:54:52.560 --> 1:54:57.200]  transition uh and then this claim that he's a russian agent securing our borders building up our
[1:54:57.200 --> 1:55:02.480]  military turning our coal back on that actually decimates the russian gas exports i mean really
[1:55:02.480 --> 1:55:06.880]  if you look at what trump's doing he's dominating he is he's doing i love how you said he's doing
[1:55:06.880 --> 1:55:11.440]  exactly what he said there's no president i think that's come in the last i know in the last eight
[1:55:11.440 --> 1:55:16.480]  years for sure but the last uh you know 12 16 years reagan was great but he didn't deliver like he
[1:55:16.480 --> 1:55:21.120]  took him three years to deliver a recovery trump's done it fifty days yes he's been outstanding and
[1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:24.720]  i respect for that whether i agree with the policies or not he's doing what he said he was
[1:55:24.720 --> 1:55:31.280]  going to do and that's fantastic um as as far as newness i i i know congressman newness a congressman
[1:55:31.280 --> 1:55:35.920]  newness is actually a friend congressman newness has always said what he meant he's always been
[1:55:35.920 --> 1:55:40.000]  honest with everything that he's had to do with myself and he just comes off as very a lot of
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:44.400]  courage very honorable he's the only guy to admit the truth when they all know the truth and and so
[1:55:44.400 --> 1:55:49.520]  if he's saying it i'll give him 99.9% that that thing is going on and as far as then doing it
[1:55:49.520 --> 1:55:53.440]  legally and then doing an elite what it is they're doing something illegally but pulling
[1:55:53.440 --> 1:55:58.160]  illegal things off of it that's typical ci at the moment pompeo needs to clean house there they need
[1:55:58.160 --> 1:56:01.440]  to come in and see what was actually going on there needs to be heads to roll at the agency
[1:56:01.440 --> 1:56:07.760]  because what they were doing they were getting information about trump and it was it was in
[1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:12.800]  my opinion that's illegal you don't do that whether it's with a you're doing an illegal act a legal
[1:56:12.800 --> 1:56:18.000]  action going to foreign powers but you're masking an illegal action by doing that well that's that's
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:24.640]  illegal isn't it doesn't whether it's still illegal so my opinion is is again pompeo needs to get in
[1:56:24.640 --> 1:56:30.800]  there and take care of the agency and find out where what was going on and see if uh and see if
[1:56:30.800 --> 1:56:37.200]  there is actual basis to to get somebody arrested get some charges against somebody uh within the
[1:56:37.200 --> 1:56:41.520]  intelligence community and congressman unions i think will pursue that i i really do he he's a
[1:56:41.520 --> 1:56:46.400]  pit bull and he will continue to pursue until he has he's run out of options he did that with us as
[1:56:46.400 --> 1:56:50.400]  best he could when he was under mike rogers on that house until subcommittee and i thought he
[1:56:50.400 --> 1:56:54.720]  did a fantastic job now he's the head of the committee exactly so if that says anything about
[1:56:54.720 --> 1:56:59.760]  how uh how honest and this man is and his integrity so i just i leave it into congressman union's
[1:56:59.760 --> 1:57:03.200]  his hands he's a subject matter expert when it comes to this and i think he can continue to pursue
[1:57:03.200 --> 1:57:09.200]  it and he will come to a good resolution if people within this the uh trump administration
[1:57:09.200 --> 1:57:14.000]  sessions and others will back him he has a good attorney general that can help him out where in
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:18.720]  our case we didn't have a good a good attorney general twice we had did eric holder and then
[1:57:18.720 --> 1:57:23.760]  literally of course we're gonna back us at all so um uh but i think i think he has the opportunity
[1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:30.240]  here to to come in and uh set again set examples so it doesn't happen again chris peranto knows
[1:57:30.240 --> 1:57:34.720]  tonto i don't know where's bob most people know who he is um there's a lot of secret wars that
[1:57:34.720 --> 1:57:39.200]  have gone on where some similar things happen but one of the most famous whether it was secret or
[1:57:39.200 --> 1:57:43.680]  or or public uh you know fire fights where you guys are completely over all right again that was
[1:57:43.680 --> 1:58:01.360]  the interview with chris tonto foranto you can find that on youtube join us tomorrow at 11 central
