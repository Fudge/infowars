[00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:18.694]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.702]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday, March 26, 2017.
[00:00:27.702 --> 00:00:28.942]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:28.942 --> 00:00:32.303]  We're going to have Alex Jones joining us in the next segment.
[00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:40.066]  And of course we saw the move against Obamacare, what Paul Ryan had put up, what Donald Trump had supported and tried to push through.
[00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:43.928]  We saw that go down in flames on Friday as they pulled out the last minute.
[00:00:44.628 --> 00:00:47.029]  There's a lot of finger-pointing, there's a lot of blame going around.
[00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:50.450]  I want to point out who the enemies remain.
[00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.252]  We look at these stories that were on the Drudge Report today about John McCain and what he is saying in Europe right now.
[00:00:55.252 --> 00:00:58.673]  You have to understand who the real opposition to our interests is.
[00:00:58.673 --> 00:01:03.335]  We need to stop this civil war that is going on within the Republican Party.
[00:01:03.335 --> 00:01:05.096]  We need to understand that John McCain
[00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:17.883]  He was in the EU this weekend, saying things like, the New World Order is under enormous strain, the titanic struggle with the forces of radicalism, so forth and so on, that the EU and the US need more connectivity.
[00:01:17.883 --> 00:01:19.844]  He says, I trust the EU.
[00:01:19.844 --> 00:01:21.405]  And he doesn't trust Donald Trump.
[00:01:21.405 --> 00:01:22.605]  He doesn't trust our Constitution.
[00:01:22.605 --> 00:01:23.986]  He doesn't trust our government.
[00:01:23.986 --> 00:01:25.547]  He trusts the EU.
[00:01:25.547 --> 00:01:29.329]  And he says, the EU and NATO were the two best sums in history.
[00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.491]  Yeah, the EU's got too many bureaucrats, he said, but not much bureaucracy.
[00:01:33.367 --> 00:01:34.530]  I don't know what he means by that.
[00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.221]  Maybe he meant to say that it doesn't have much bureaucracy.
[00:01:38.976 --> 00:01:39.557]  I don't know.
[00:01:39.557 --> 00:01:43.700]  I mean, the guy, as Rand Paul said, he's out there.
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.321]  He's an argument for term limits.
[00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:49.124]  He's a very dangerous individual, however.
[00:01:49.124 --> 00:01:51.506]  He remains a very bitter old man.
[00:01:51.506 --> 00:01:57.411]  He talks about, even when he says, yeah, okay, we'd like to see European countries contribute some money to their defense.
[00:01:57.411 --> 00:02:02.595]  But then he says, hey, they had contributed a thousand lives to our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:02:02.595 --> 00:02:05.117]  Ask their mothers if they think that was a big contribution.
[00:02:05.117 --> 00:02:06.978]  I would say ask their mothers if they think they got
[00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:13.263]  Uh, what they wanted from their sons' lives and their daughters' lives.
[00:02:13.263 --> 00:02:14.544]  Was that worth it?
[00:02:14.544 --> 00:02:17.546]  Were John McCain's wars worth it for you?
[00:02:17.546 --> 00:02:18.927]  All of you in Europe?
[00:02:18.927 --> 00:02:20.589]  All of you in America?
[00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:22.090]  What have we gained in Iraq?
[00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:31.297]  What have we gained by using Al-Qaeda and ISIS as surrogates to set the Middle East on fire, from Libya to Syria and Iraq?
[00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.192]  We haven't gained anything with these wars.
[00:02:35.192 --> 00:02:38.013]  And we need to understand that as we move forward.
[00:02:38.013 --> 00:02:42.675]  This is the true enemy of America, of the European Union.
[00:02:42.675 --> 00:02:45.497]  And then he complains, I've yet to meet President Trump since he took office.
[00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:47.038]  But he has met with ISIS!
[00:02:48.138 --> 00:02:52.420]  He has met with the people that he has organized, that he's funded, that he's trained.
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.983]  He is really, truly the head of the dark government meeting with the Europeans and the European Union.
[00:02:57.983 --> 00:03:02.486]  I would say just meeting with the EU bureaucracy and of course we have the EU chief.
[00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:10.852]  Saying, and as it's reported in the Daily Express, they refer to Juncker as the globalist gangster Juncker.
[00:03:10.852 --> 00:03:14.195]  They say that he threatens Trump with war if the European Union collapses.
[00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:21.001]  He reportedly said, if the European Union collapses, you will have a new war in the Western Balkans.
[00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:22.662]  That's a quote from the Daily Express.
[00:03:22.662 --> 00:03:26.966]  Meanwhile, China, who have become the darlings of the globalists,
[00:03:27.981 --> 00:03:33.562]  We have the Chinese Vice Premier telling a gathering of Asian leaders that the world must commit to multilateral.
[00:03:33.562 --> 00:03:35.083]  Remember, this is the difference.
[00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:37.483]  It's all the difference in the world, folks.
[00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:40.484]  Multilateral versus bilateral.
[00:03:40.484 --> 00:03:41.685]  See, we're not isolationists.
[00:03:41.685 --> 00:03:46.706]  Donald Trump has pointed out over and over again what he wants to have is bilateral trade agreements, one-on-one with other nations.
[00:03:47.466 --> 00:03:56.768]  What we do not want to have is some supra-national organization that is created when you start to pursue multilateral free trade agreements.
[00:03:56.768 --> 00:03:59.048]  First of all, they're very difficult to do.
[00:03:59.048 --> 00:04:03.929]  And what you wind up doing is appointing some central committee to dictate terms to everyone else.
[00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:05.890]  That was what TPP did.
[00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.651]  And I think Donald Trump is absolutely right to throw that out at the very beginning.
[00:04:09.651 --> 00:04:11.371]  I wish he had done that with healthcare.
[00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:26.276]  I wish they had used all their powers instead of trying to work with the GOP establishment, Paul Ryan, the people that we know have been there for seven, eight years, working against repealing Obamacare.
[00:04:26.276 --> 00:04:29.437]  Paul Ryan has been on the other side.
[00:04:29.437 --> 00:04:31.098]  He does not want to see this thing repealed.
[00:04:31.858 --> 00:04:34.260]  And so when you work with him, you've got to understand, it's not going to happen.
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.526]  But when we saw TPP, it wasn't... Donald Trump didn't come in and say, we're going to renegotiate these details of TPP.
[00:04:39.526 --> 00:04:46.692]  He said, no, we're not going to have a system, a multilateral system that is going to exercise sovereignty over us.
[00:04:46.692 --> 00:04:50.236]  Well, we don't want sovereignty exercised over us in Obamacare.
[00:04:50.236 --> 00:04:51.257]  That's the problem.
[00:04:51.257 --> 00:04:51.637]  Stay with us.
[00:04:51.637 --> 00:04:53.119]  We'll be right back with Alex Jones.
[00:05:00.453 --> 00:05:02.754]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[00:05:02.754 --> 00:05:04.334]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[00:05:04.334 --> 00:05:08.235]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.

[00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:21.859]  The reality is
[00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:26.946]  It's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[00:05:26.946 --> 00:05:34.737]  Zika 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.

[00:06:04.983 --> 00:06:11.847]  The globalist's great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[00:06:11.847 --> 00:06:20.651]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them, on our journey to hell.
[00:06:20.651 --> 00:06:23.333]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:36.047 --> 00:06:40.512]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday, March 26, 2017.
[00:06:40.512 --> 00:06:45.677]  Here's Alex Jones about what's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:06:45.677 --> 00:06:46.398]  That's right, David.
[00:06:46.398 --> 00:06:47.379]  Thanks for doing a great job.
[00:06:48.368 --> 00:07:07.653]  You know, I've tried to quantify in the last three, four months exactly what we've covered with the Podesta emails and Wiener, the New York Times admitting is about to be indicted for child pornography and Jerry Epstein and the Lolita Express with the children being flown out for sex slavery, Bill Clinton being on board.
[00:07:07.653 --> 00:07:11.674]  That's been in CNN, Associated Press, you name it.
[00:07:11.674 --> 00:07:14.695]  And we've covered all that as it unfolds.
[00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:19.614]  We've all seen the big pedophile networks in Europe, the pedophile networks in the UK.
[00:07:19.614 --> 00:07:23.337]  This really is the rulers of the world, these vampires.
[00:07:23.337 --> 00:07:31.885]  And so going back into November, I saw everybody focus off of what we were covering in New York and the law enforcement reports onto a pizza place.
[00:07:32.817 --> 00:07:35.418]  Uh, there, uh, in D.C.
[00:07:35.418 --> 00:07:52.663]  So we looked at it, and I saw some fake reports mixed in, and I said, listen, we're killing this because it's a diversion from all the admitted child trafficking, all the admitted stuff going on, uh, and, and, and I believe that the media is focused on some innocent place as a diversion, and I went into discredit things.
[00:07:52.663 --> 00:08:00.906]  I mean, hell, they're pretty much saying now the Catholic Church never had a pedophile problem, or that, uh, Penn State didn't have a problem, or Jerry Sandusky didn't have a problem, or his son.
[00:08:00.906 --> 00:08:02.286]  And the truth is, Trump
[00:08:03.383 --> 00:08:09.648]  The Patriots in our intelligence agencies are aware of this, and they're, as Town Hall has reported, rolling up these networks.
[00:08:09.648 --> 00:08:18.334]  So, I put out a retraction clarification Friday, specifically on Comet Ping Pong and Mr. Alphonso.
[00:08:18.334 --> 00:08:23.258]  I don't believe we're involved in all this, because I want to kill that debate, that discussion.
[00:08:23.778 --> 00:08:29.683]  Which the media keeps claiming I'm behind to force it onto the real issues that we're actually pointing at.
[00:08:29.683 --> 00:08:37.791]  So I point fingers coming up at the bottom of the hour of where I think people should research, where the facts are, and where Pizzagate has diverted people.
[00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:42.134]  Some folks say, oh my god, you're trying to cover up crimes against children.
[00:08:42.134 --> 00:08:42.575]  No, I'm not.
[00:08:43.195 --> 00:08:52.084]  Fake news reports or mainstream media hyping something up, saying nothing's happening there, so we all run there to cover it, is a classic diversionary tactic.
[00:08:52.084 --> 00:08:57.009]  And I think they're using Comic Ping Pong and Alephantis and others as the diversionary issue.
[00:08:57.009 --> 00:09:02.955]  I've been saying that since December 1st, when I put out an internal memo at InfoWars saying, this is a diversion, this is a distraction.
[00:09:02.955 --> 00:09:03.896]  We didn't create the story.
[00:09:05.146 --> 00:09:06.668]  We didn't push it for weeks.
[00:09:06.668 --> 00:09:09.511]  Some of our listeners kind of bullied us into covering it.
[00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:12.814]  And then once I saw Telltale Signs, I said, no, we're not doing it.
[00:09:12.814 --> 00:09:13.795]  So that's what's happening.
[00:09:13.795 --> 00:09:15.938]  This is an attempt at an establishment claim.
[00:09:15.938 --> 00:09:18.060]  There's no child sex abuse in the world.
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.142]  Pedophilia doesn't exist.
[00:09:20.142 --> 00:09:21.623]  And, you know, none of this is happening.
[00:09:21.623 --> 00:09:24.867]  Even the Salon Magazine promotes pedophilia.
[00:09:24.867 --> 00:09:27.550]  So we're here exposing all this big report.
[00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:36.756]  Breaking it all down as we go on the offense against the real predators against children and expose some of the tricks they've been using to divert us off.
[00:09:36.756 --> 00:09:37.857]  So back to David Knight.
[00:09:37.857 --> 00:09:41.099]  My special report comes up in about 20 minutes at InfoWars.com.
[00:09:41.099 --> 00:09:43.260]  Folks, spread the word.
[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.461]  History is happening now.
[00:09:45.558 --> 00:09:48.901]  Thank you Alex, and of course we're going to play that report at the bottom of the hour.
[00:09:48.901 --> 00:10:00.031]  As I was talking about at the top of the hour as we came in, those of you who are just joining us now, we've seen John McCain essentially gloating this weekend over what happened in Washington.
[00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:02.493]  Because he sees this as his side winning.
[00:10:03.643 --> 00:10:08.709]  And one of the things that he said was, you know, Donald Trump failed on this because he needs to reach out to the other side.
[00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:11.572]  To the Democrats and other opponents.
[00:10:11.572 --> 00:10:12.413]  In other words, like him.
[00:10:12.413 --> 00:10:17.839]  You have to understand that John McCain and Lindsey Graham have put themselves up as leaders of the opposition.
[00:10:17.839 --> 00:10:19.742]  The Democrats are in such disarray.
[00:10:20.779 --> 00:10:23.380]  That they're not really an effective opposition.
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:28.081]  And we have to understand, we do not need the Democrats to repeal Obamacare.
[00:10:28.081 --> 00:10:30.501]  They didn't need the Republicans to pass it, did they?
[00:10:30.501 --> 00:10:34.342]  And we've got a much stronger situation than they did at this point.
[00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:37.163]  What we lack is the understanding and the will to do it.
[00:10:37.163 --> 00:10:40.883]  But I want to repeat what I said at the top of the hour about John McCain.
[00:10:40.883 --> 00:10:42.784]  The fact that he goes to Brussels
[00:10:43.464 --> 00:10:44.505]  And he says this type of stuff.
[00:10:44.505 --> 00:10:48.168]  We have a new world order that is under enormous strain.
[00:10:48.168 --> 00:10:51.130]  We have a titanic struggle with the forces of radicalism.
[00:10:51.681 --> 00:10:56.782]  And of course, he's not really concerned about Islamic radicalism.
[00:10:56.782 --> 00:10:59.243]  He's concerned about nationals.
[00:10:59.243 --> 00:11:00.543]  People who want nationalism.
[00:11:00.543 --> 00:11:05.705]  That's the radicals that really concern him because that's where he focuses his speech.
[00:11:05.705 --> 00:11:10.086]  He said the EU and the US need to develop more connectivity.
[00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:12.487]  He said, I trust the EU.
[00:11:12.487 --> 00:11:13.507]  He doesn't trust Donald Trump.
[00:11:14.167 --> 00:11:16.269]  He doesn't trust our Constitution.
[00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:30.481]  He doesn't trust the form of government that we had until the early 20th century, where we basically had free trade within the United States, but we collected our taxes at the border for goods that were coming into our country.
[00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:37.126]  And you understand that when they created the income tax and they created the Federal Reserve at the same time, they also flipped our tax system
[00:11:38.089 --> 00:11:46.272]  So that we weren't collecting the taxes at the border, but we turned the taxation again inside on American citizens and on American businesses.
[00:11:46.272 --> 00:11:48.953]  And that's the way that it has remained.
[00:11:48.953 --> 00:11:56.576]  Thomas Jefferson said in his second inaugural address, and I've mentioned this many times, we need to remember what he did in one term.
[00:11:56.576 --> 00:11:59.938]  He said, we have eliminated useless offices, and by doing so,
[00:12:00.646 --> 00:12:04.268]  We have been able to eliminate all internal taxation.
[00:12:04.268 --> 00:12:08.250]  So all their taxes were funded by tariffs on goods that were coming in.
[00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:13.212]  That allowed a free trade zone within America, and it allowed America to get strong.
[00:12:13.212 --> 00:12:18.315]  And he said, what laborer, what mechanic, knows the tax man in America?
[00:12:18.315 --> 00:12:18.695]  Nobody.
[00:12:19.434 --> 00:12:23.697]  So they could go about their lives without being harassed and micromanaged from Washington.
[00:12:23.697 --> 00:12:26.959]  That's why we need to get rid of Obama tax.
[00:12:26.959 --> 00:12:30.522]  I don't want to go back to 1776 as well on this.
[00:12:30.522 --> 00:12:35.706]  We have to understand the American Revolution was fought over 3% tax on tea.
[00:12:35.706 --> 00:12:38.608]  It wasn't the level of taxation.
[00:12:38.608 --> 00:12:42.311]  It was who was imposing it and the way that it was imposed.
[00:12:42.311 --> 00:12:46.113]  And as I said in the last segment, Donald Trump was absolutely right to just throw out TPP.
[00:12:47.213 --> 00:12:56.458]  You did not want to mess with that and manage that around the edges and say, well, we never really got a chance to have an open public debate about this.
[00:12:56.458 --> 00:12:59.139]  It was done in secret, you know, like Paul Ryan's bill.
[00:12:59.139 --> 00:13:02.081]  Like Nancy Pelosi's bill with Obamacare initially.
[00:13:02.081 --> 00:13:03.802]  We don't want to have legislation that way.
[00:13:03.802 --> 00:13:06.183]  That's enough reason right there to reject it.
[00:13:06.183 --> 00:13:09.004]  The way it was presented, the way it was hidden from us.
[00:13:09.004 --> 00:13:11.586]  Do you even know what's in Obamacare for the most part?
[00:13:11.586 --> 00:13:12.166]  Of course you don't.
[00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:14.042]  Most of us don't really know.
[00:13:14.042 --> 00:13:17.085]  We do know that our health care premiums have skyrocketed.
[00:13:17.085 --> 00:13:18.546]  And there's a reason for that.
[00:13:18.546 --> 00:13:19.607]  You know, we had a situation.
[00:13:19.607 --> 00:13:20.028]  Think about it.
[00:13:20.028 --> 00:13:22.410]  We had a couple of different classes of people.
[00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:23.631]  We had some people who didn't want it.
[00:13:23.631 --> 00:13:24.552]  They didn't buy it.
[00:13:24.552 --> 00:13:25.973]  Well, they're not going to be allowed to do that.
[00:13:25.973 --> 00:13:29.296]  We're going to have the government hold a gun to their head and force them to do that.
[00:13:29.296 --> 00:13:31.819]  We had other people who couldn't afford it, but they wanted you to pay for it.
[00:13:32.679 --> 00:13:34.400]  Including illegal immigrants.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.621]  And that's what they did with that.
[00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:38.902]  And then you had those who wanted it, but now they can no longer afford it.
[00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:42.684]  That's what Obamacare, affordable healthcare, has done for us.
[00:13:42.684 --> 00:13:47.747]  But there's another aspect of this that's very important, and it reflects back on this 3% tax on tea issue.
[00:13:47.747 --> 00:13:51.649]  And of course, we know that, like I said, it wasn't the level of taxation.
[00:13:51.649 --> 00:13:55.771]  We've got many states, they tax food, they tax all your food, not just your tea.
[00:13:55.771 --> 00:13:57.952]  They tax everything you eat.
[00:13:57.952 --> 00:14:00.053]  In many places, they tax your medicines as well.
[00:14:00.053 --> 00:14:01.954]  Some states, they have exemptions for those things.
[00:14:02.657 --> 00:14:05.380]  But in a lot of states, they tax it all.
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.321]  They did in North Carolina.
[00:14:07.321 --> 00:14:15.089]  And so, what you have is a situation where, yeah, people will put up with an 8% tax on everything, not just their tea.
[00:14:15.089 --> 00:14:17.892]  But they want to have a say-so in what's going on with this.
[00:14:17.892 --> 00:14:23.257]  They don't want to have this stuff dictated to them by foreign bureaucrats or people who are very distant from them.
[00:14:23.919 --> 00:14:27.243]  These bureaucrats in Washington might as well be from a foreign country.
[00:14:27.243 --> 00:14:30.847]  Washington is a foreign country, as Matt Drudge said.
[00:14:30.847 --> 00:14:32.889]  The swamp is draining you.
[00:14:32.889 --> 00:14:34.331]  You're not draining the swamp at this point.
[00:14:34.331 --> 00:14:36.133]  But understand the structure of this.
[00:14:36.133 --> 00:14:42.380]  This is key as to why many people said you must repeal the mechanism, just like you repealed the mechanism of TPP.
[00:14:43.041 --> 00:14:51.246]  TPP, and I think Donald Trump understood this, TPP wasn't simply about some organization that was above all the other countries.
[00:14:51.246 --> 00:14:59.071]  It was going to determine which industries and which countries are going to be allowed to succeed at the expense of other industries and other countries.
[00:14:59.071 --> 00:15:05.995]  No, what it did was it created a transnational governing committee for which we had no representation.
[00:15:05.995 --> 00:15:11.058]  And that committee, as it was being sold to us, they said, well, we need to have this as a bulwark against Chinese competition.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:18.305]  Well, they could have added China the very next day, because as Jeff Sessions pointed out, it was a living document.
[00:15:18.305 --> 00:15:24.170]  Those people who were going to be in that little committee, they would be able to change anything about that secret document.
[00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:27.473]  I guess that's one of the reasons why it wasn't really important, was it, that we see that.
[00:15:28.646 --> 00:15:31.488]  Because anything in that document could be changed.
[00:15:31.488 --> 00:15:33.910]  The same thing happened with Obamacare.
[00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:36.651]  It really wasn't important that you understand that bill.
[00:15:36.651 --> 00:15:38.753]  After the bill got passed, Nancy Pelosi was right.
[00:15:38.753 --> 00:15:40.394]  Then we would see what was in it.
[00:15:40.394 --> 00:15:46.098]  Because it would be turned over to a bureaucracy that would exercise that same kind of dictatorial power.
[00:15:46.758 --> 00:15:51.964]  And it's not enough to have a health czar when that health czar is a good guy like Tom Price.
[00:15:51.964 --> 00:15:52.805]  How long is he going to be there?
[00:15:52.805 --> 00:15:55.048]  Two, three, four years, maybe eight years?
[00:15:55.048 --> 00:15:57.871]  Then who takes his place and overturns everything he undid?
[00:15:57.871 --> 00:15:59.453]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:15:59.453 --> 00:16:04.499]  Today we call it bone broth, and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits.
[00:16:04.619 --> 00:16:11.021]  Before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk, we are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslines.com.
[00:16:11.021 --> 00:16:20.805]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:16:20.805 --> 00:16:21.645]  Caveman.
[00:16:21.645 --> 00:16:26.727]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:16:26.727 --> 00:16:28.828]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:16:29.128 --> 00:16:32.289]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:16:32.289 --> 00:16:37.430]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:45.573]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:16:45.573 --> 00:16:53.515]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:16:53.515 --> 00:16:58.156]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and forwardslife.com today.

[00:17:21.037 --> 00:17:22.157]  I don't feel good.
[00:17:22.157 --> 00:17:25.919]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:28.621]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:17:28.621 --> 00:17:34.404]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:17:34.404 --> 00:17:37.366]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:17:37.366 --> 00:17:40.908]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[00:17:40.908 --> 00:17:43.149]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[00:17:43.149 --> 00:17:43.509]  I love it.
[00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:46.453]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:17:46.453 --> 00:17:47.474]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:17:47.474 --> 00:17:53.421]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[00:17:53.421 --> 00:17:55.324]  It's got a five-star rating.
[00:17:55.324 --> 00:17:57.507]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[00:18:00.228 --> 00:18:06.771]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:18:06.771 --> 00:18:09.993]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:18:09.993 --> 00:18:15.576]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:18:15.576 --> 00:18:21.699]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:18:21.699 --> 00:18:24.980]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.421]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[00:18:26.621 --> 00:18:30.944]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:18:30.944 --> 00:18:33.885]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:18:33.885 --> 00:18:35.546]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:18:35.546 --> 00:18:38.988]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:18:38.988 --> 00:18:41.590]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:42.650]  It's in powder form.
[00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:45.532]  We have so many five-star reviews.

[00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:25.231]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:20:25.231 --> 00:20:29.253]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:29.253 --> 00:20:32.914]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:32.914 --> 00:20:33.494]  I'm David Knight.
[00:20:33.494 --> 00:20:43.777]  We're going to have Alex joining us with a report at the bottom of the hour, but I want to finish up on what we had been talking about in the last segment, and that is the failure to repeal Obamacare.
[00:20:44.537 --> 00:20:47.438]  And as I look at it, it was a failure to try.
[00:20:47.438 --> 00:20:51.680]  Because it was being led by Paul Ryan, a man that we know did not want to repeal Obamacare.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.142]  This is a man that was handpicked to run with Mitt Romney.
[00:20:54.142 --> 00:20:58.404]  Mitt Romney had already put in Obamacare in Massachusetts with Ted Kennedy.
[00:20:58.404 --> 00:21:01.085]  It was going to be exactly identical to that.
[00:21:02.065 --> 00:21:09.729]  We've had Paul Ryan working against that, working against borders, closing the borders, always open borders has been Paul Ryan.
[00:21:09.729 --> 00:21:11.891]  Also working against Trump on trade.
[00:21:11.891 --> 00:21:19.215]  He is going to be the opposition and of course John McCain was reminding everybody that he was the opposition in Brussels this weekend.
[00:21:20.035 --> 00:21:32.505]  Talking to the European leadership there at the EU, telling them how much he loves their New World Order, how essential it is for the US and the European Union to merge together, to have much closer ties.
[00:21:32.505 --> 00:21:36.008]  This is what we were concerned about with these partnership agreements.
[00:21:36.008 --> 00:21:43.074]  They always create an economic unity, then they create a sovereign unity, and of course there's also a military component to this as well.
[00:21:43.074 --> 00:21:44.876]  But when you look at the Trans-Pacific Partnership,
[00:21:45.939 --> 00:21:55.227]  And when we look at what happened in 1776, both of these, when we got rid of them, when Donald Trump threw out the TPP and said it's dead, he didn't try to reform it, he just killed it.
[00:21:55.227 --> 00:21:57.268]  That's what he should have done with Obamacare.
[00:21:57.268 --> 00:22:01.492]  Should have taken a decisive action on that, and hopefully that will still happen.
[00:22:01.492 --> 00:22:02.092]  And here's why.
[00:22:02.873 --> 00:22:12.100]  For the same reason that we had a revolution here in 1776, because we didn't want a foreign body to control our economy, just like TPP.
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:17.824]  We didn't want people saying, well we're going to mandate this for you, we're going to raise the taxes to whatever we want, and you're not going to have any say so about it.
[00:22:17.824 --> 00:22:20.226]  Remember, taxation without representation.
[00:22:20.226 --> 00:22:26.031]  Now we have not only taxation without representation, but we have taxation without, we have regulation without representation.
[00:22:26.031 --> 00:22:30.154]  That's the bureaucracy in Washington that decides everything.
[00:22:30.967 --> 00:22:33.409]  We've had our Congress abdicate everything to them.
[00:22:33.409 --> 00:22:37.091]  That's why Nancy Pelosi can say, well, you have to read the bill to find out what's in it.
[00:22:37.091 --> 00:22:39.032]  That's why Paul Ryan can do the same thing.
[00:22:39.032 --> 00:22:49.739]  It doesn't really matter what bill they produce, just as it didn't really matter what TPP was, because TPP would be changed by the international bureaucracy that you would have no control over once they got it established.
[00:22:49.739 --> 00:22:55.783]  Just as Obamacare would be changed by the government bureaucracy, the Health and Human Services bureaucracy.
[00:22:56.323 --> 00:23:04.767]  Now when we look at this idea that we have three phases where this is going to come through, and of course Trump said phase two and three are coming, of this wonderful health care overhaul.
[00:23:04.767 --> 00:23:06.307]  He said they're going to be coming soon.
[00:23:06.307 --> 00:23:12.990]  I want to take a look at Paul Ryan's description of the three phases of repeal and replace.
[00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:20.453]  Now he says we're going to take advantage of the budget reconciliation process to avoid a democratic filibuster.
[00:23:20.453 --> 00:23:24.335]  Well there were some things that were taken out, other things that were not taken out in that process.
[00:23:25.472 --> 00:23:27.694]  And then we don't really know how that's going to be reconciled, do we?
[00:23:27.694 --> 00:23:30.055]  Because that's also a kind of a closed process.
[00:23:30.055 --> 00:23:32.697]  It's negotiated between the Senate and the House.
[00:23:32.697 --> 00:23:36.660]  So they put a lot of stuff there that they, again, it's a lot of shell games.
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:42.884]  And we hear from Paul Ryan and the GOP establishment that have fought tooth and nail to keep Obamacare from being repealed.
[00:23:42.884 --> 00:23:43.764]  Just trust us.
[00:23:43.764 --> 00:23:44.505]  We'll get there.
[00:23:44.505 --> 00:23:46.046]  We'll get there in Phase 2 and Phase 3.
[00:23:46.046 --> 00:23:49.088]  I know it's not here in Phase 1, but trust us, it'll be there in Phase 2 and 3.
[00:23:49.088 --> 00:23:49.728]  Well, what's Phase 2?
[00:23:50.689 --> 00:23:52.210]  Phase 2 says Paul Ryan.
[00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:53.551]  This is his report.
[00:23:53.551 --> 00:23:54.312]  Phase 2.
[00:23:54.312 --> 00:23:59.155]  Phase 2 will be all the regulatory flexibility that the Secretary of HHS has to deregulate.
[00:23:59.155 --> 00:24:02.818]  That's the best argument for repeal against Obamacare right there.
[00:24:02.818 --> 00:24:06.041]  We should not have a czar over our health care.
[00:24:07.116 --> 00:24:25.587]  That, along with the mandates and the taxes and lies that were sold to us with Obamacare, telling us in the Supreme Court, as we had Justice Roberts say, well, okay, they don't have the capability to mandate that you buy health care from somebody else, but they can put an economic penalty against you and force you to buy it from somebody else and call it a tax.
[00:24:25.587 --> 00:24:28.669]  No, a tax is what the government collects from its citizens.
[00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:35.471]  And quite frankly, if we go back and look at the Constitution, they don't have the ability to directly tax us as individuals.
[00:24:35.471 --> 00:24:40.092]  That's what many of the tax protesters have pointed out to people, but nobody's listening to that either.
[00:24:40.092 --> 00:24:42.693]  When you ignore the Constitution, this is what we wind up with.
[00:24:42.693 --> 00:24:56.498]  What we're going to wind up with, if we have a situation where we use all the flexibility and the dictatorial powers of Tom Price to shut down certain aspects of Obamacare, those aspects will be put right back in with the next HHS Secretary.
[00:24:56.498 --> 00:24:57.218]  Whenever that comes.
[00:24:58.336 --> 00:25:02.960]  Whether that's four years from now or eight years from now, we have to get rid of that power.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.282]  That's what Donald Trump understood about the TPP.
[00:25:05.282 --> 00:25:09.826]  That we couldn't have this transnational body dictating our economy to us.
[00:25:09.826 --> 00:25:13.789]  We can't have HHS dictating our health care to us.
[00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:15.170]  That's got to stop.
[00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:16.992]  That's why we have to have repeal.
[00:25:16.992 --> 00:25:19.914]  The fundamental structure of Obamacare has to go.
[00:25:19.914 --> 00:25:22.577]  Then we can start replacing the coercion with choice.
[00:25:22.577 --> 00:25:25.820]  We can start replacing the mandates with marketplace.
[00:25:26.834 --> 00:25:30.557]  You have to understand that we have to have choices as consumers.
[00:25:30.557 --> 00:25:38.905]  You will never control cost if you go with a command-control economy directed from the center.
[00:25:38.905 --> 00:25:44.310]  If you believe that, I'll give you a free ticket to a Venezuelan bakery, okay?
[00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:45.511]  Go down there and see what's happening.
[00:25:45.511 --> 00:25:49.335]  They're locking people up in jail because of the scarcity they've got there, the bakeries.
[00:25:50.421 --> 00:25:54.623]  They're hunting down policemen in the street to rob them of their guns.
[00:25:54.623 --> 00:25:57.384]  They're killing dogs and cats in the streets.
[00:25:57.384 --> 00:26:05.548]  It's absolute chaos because that's where this always leads when you try to rob other people to get what you can't afford.
[00:26:05.548 --> 00:26:10.450]  And of course we're robbing other people to give benefits to illegal aliens who come into our country.
[00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:12.110]  We're giving them health care.
[00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:14.992]  So the bottom line is when you look at phase two and they're touting that
[00:26:15.652 --> 00:26:19.715]  That Tom Price, Secretary of HHS, yeah, he might replace a lot of this stuff.
[00:26:19.715 --> 00:26:26.961]  Remember we have this back and forth every time we get a Republican changeover from a Republican to a Democrat and vice versa.
[00:26:26.961 --> 00:26:33.907]  They would always fund abortions with NGOs abroad or they would stop the funding of abortion with NGOs abroad.
[00:26:33.907 --> 00:26:35.829]  They go back and forth, they go back and forth.
[00:26:35.829 --> 00:26:36.730]  That's why they talk about
[00:26:37.489 --> 00:26:40.051]  Well, now we've got Planned Parenthood, we're going to get rid of Planned Parenthood.
[00:26:40.051 --> 00:26:41.071]  No, you're not.
[00:26:41.071 --> 00:26:49.876]  You're not going to get rid of anything if you don't get rid of this power that has been given to HHS and the bureaucracy.
[00:26:49.876 --> 00:26:51.097]  That has to stop.
[00:26:51.097 --> 00:26:53.538]  We have to have a Congress that is going to seize that power.
[00:26:53.538 --> 00:26:59.102]  And I'm glad that we had people who stood on principle and said, no, we have to get rid of this structure.
[00:26:59.102 --> 00:27:01.003]  We have to understand what's truly happening here.
[00:27:02.199 --> 00:27:09.841]  Somebody needs to explain to Donald Trump that what is going on here is not... We've got the titanic healthcare, and he understands that.
[00:27:09.841 --> 00:27:12.702]  It's going to sink, it's going to go down, it's not sustainable.
[00:27:12.702 --> 00:27:30.928]  When we had the CBO look at their grading, they said more people are going to lose healthcare if you put this in and continue to kick this can down the road, continue to drive the titanic toward the iceberg, albeit at a maybe slower speed, more people are going to lose their healthcare than if you just repeal this thing.
[00:27:32.062 --> 00:27:34.123]  And who got their health care?
[00:27:34.123 --> 00:27:48.807]  Again, it was people who A. had chosen not to get it or B. people who couldn't afford it and they did it at the expense of people who wanted it and could afford it and had the ability previously to make a choice about what insurance coverage they wanted.
[00:27:48.807 --> 00:27:59.291]  That's expanding the welfare rolls for the purpose of a socialist health care system is not something that we should be using as a metric of success.
[00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:02.131]  That is a metric of failure.
[00:28:02.131 --> 00:28:06.493]  So we're talking about how many people were added to the rolls because of Obamacare.
[00:28:06.493 --> 00:28:07.614]  That's not the metric.
[00:28:07.614 --> 00:28:11.516]  You have to look at what has happened to our health care costs and to our insurance costs.
[00:28:11.516 --> 00:28:12.376]  That's the metric.
[00:28:12.376 --> 00:28:15.558]  Not the number of people that have been added to the welfare state.
[00:28:15.558 --> 00:28:19.059]  That's not the thing that we want to optimize, unless you're a Democrat.
[00:28:19.059 --> 00:28:23.782]  Unless you're trying to keep people dependent on you, because that's your path to political power.
[00:28:24.602 --> 00:28:27.206]  Republicans should reject that out of hand.
[00:28:27.206 --> 00:28:29.569]  They should reject the command-control economy.
[00:28:29.569 --> 00:28:35.417]  They should reject the czar, even if the czar is a benevolent dictator for four years or eight years.
[00:28:35.417 --> 00:28:37.700]  We don't want that struggle.
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.763]  And when you talk about getting rid of interstate
[00:28:40.423 --> 00:28:42.605]  Uh, competition across state lines.
[00:28:42.605 --> 00:28:45.327]  That should have been gotten rid of by the Commerce Clause.
[00:28:45.327 --> 00:28:49.550]  The real Constitutional Commerce Clause is exactly the opposite of what they use it for.
[00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:52.713]  They use the Commerce Clause for their illegal prohibition of drugs.
[00:28:52.713 --> 00:28:55.115]  Instead, they ought to use it to create a free market in America.
[00:28:55.115 --> 00:28:55.975]  They could do that now.
[00:28:55.975 --> 00:28:57.857]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:05.015]  Appearing on the Drudge Report this morning, potential smoking gun showed Obama administration spied on Trump team.
[00:29:05.015 --> 00:29:15.684]  Source says, Republican congressional investigators expect a potential smoking gun establishing that the Obama administration spied on the Trump transition team and possibly the president-elect himself.
[00:29:15.684 --> 00:29:18.506]  Intelligence Committee Chair David Nunes from California
[00:29:18.686 --> 00:29:22.410]  ...has said he expects that the NSA will provide him this smoking gun evidence.
[00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:32.842]  The intelligence is said to leave no doubt that the Obama administration in its closing days was using the cover of legitimate surveillance on foreign targets to spy on President-elect Trump, according to sources.
[00:29:32.842 --> 00:29:34.504]  And basically, it boils down to this.
[00:29:34.764 --> 00:29:40.630]  While it's legal for the deep state to collect intelligence on foreign targets, it's not legal for the names of U.S.
[00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:42.272]  citizens to be unmasked.
[00:29:42.272 --> 00:29:45.435]  This was done and was disseminated through intelligence reports.
[00:29:45.435 --> 00:29:50.860]  Now looking back at Trump's March 4th wiretapping tweets, it seems he was right all along.
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:55.304]  Soon we will find out if Obama administration officials are too big to jail.
[00:29:55.304 --> 00:29:58.428]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:30:00.214 --> 00:30:08.197]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[00:30:08.197 --> 00:30:14.839]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[00:30:14.839 --> 00:30:19.001]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology.
[00:30:19.161 --> 00:30:23.406]  That disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[00:30:23.406 --> 00:30:29.272]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.
[00:30:29.272 --> 00:30:32.436]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:30:32.436 --> 00:30:38.182]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:30:38.502 --> 00:30:39.263]  It works.
[00:30:39.263 --> 00:30:47.587]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[00:30:47.587 --> 00:30:57.472]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.
[00:30:57.472 --> 00:30:57.952]  A total 360 win.
[00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:00.631]  Hey, everyone!
[00:31:00.631 --> 00:31:06.754]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:31:06.754 --> 00:31:08.836]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:31:08.836 --> 00:31:19.122]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:31:19.122 --> 00:31:25.086]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[00:31:25.566 --> 00:31:40.503]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[00:31:40.523 --> 00:31:40.923]  I think so.
[00:31:59.847 --> 00:32:01.687]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:32:01.687 --> 00:32:08.289]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:32:08.289 --> 00:32:11.450]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:21.232]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:32:21.232 --> 00:32:22.072]  Caveman.
[00:32:22.072 --> 00:32:27.133]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:32:27.133 --> 00:32:29.254]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:32:29.554 --> 00:32:32.716]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:32:32.716 --> 00:32:37.858]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:32:37.858 --> 00:32:46.002]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:32:46.002 --> 00:32:53.786]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:32:53.786 --> 00:32:58.608]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and 4WarsLife.com today.
[00:33:03.611 --> 00:33:14.598]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:14.598 --> 00:33:15.839]  You found it!
[00:33:15.839 --> 00:33:17.840]  The tip of the spear!
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:22.043]  It is The Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:22.043 --> 00:33:24.725]  And now, your host, David Knight!
[00:33:29.048 --> 00:33:30.491]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:30.491 --> 00:33:32.515]  I'm David Knight on this Sunday, March 26, 2017.
[00:33:32.515 --> 00:33:39.550]  I want to go back and talk about the fundamental problems with Obamacare, the necessity for repeal.
[00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:57.258]  But before we do, real quickly, we really appreciate your support, especially at this time that we see that Google is trying to do everything that they can, and YouTube and Facebook, to try to censor our news going out, blaming us and saying that it's Russian bots who are putting out our stories.
[00:33:57.258 --> 00:34:03.522]  But of course, it's their bots that are shutting down your ability to share our stories, that are attacking our stories.
[00:34:03.522 --> 00:34:07.924]  And of course, the latest evidence of this, we've seen them going both ways in terms of attacking ads.
[00:34:08.715 --> 00:34:14.161]  First they said, well, we're not going to let you advertise on our ad placement products.
[00:34:14.161 --> 00:34:18.345]  You know, you go to a website and they have these third-party organizations.
[00:34:18.345 --> 00:34:21.509]  This particular one, AdRoll, works with Google.
[00:34:21.509 --> 00:34:28.056]  And they will serve our ads for our products, for things like Brain Force, for things like Cloidal Silver.
[00:34:29.022 --> 00:34:33.810]  They will serve those ads on other websites, and we can try to get sales for that.
[00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:40.802]  And of course, that directs people to our InfoWars Live or InfoWars Store that are not political sites, and say, well, we're not going to allow that to happen.
[00:34:40.802 --> 00:34:42.404]  Now they're going the other direction as well.
[00:34:43.362 --> 00:34:49.625]  They're trying to throttle the revenue, I guess we should start calling them rev limiters, you know, like you've got on an engine.
[00:34:49.625 --> 00:34:56.449]  This is the engine of freedom, the engine of free speech, and they're trying to put rev limiters on it, limiting our revenue in both directions.
[00:34:56.449 --> 00:35:04.633]  First of all, saying we're not going to allow you to serve ads, and then saying we're not going to let people put ads on your videos, because guess who's complaining about it?
[00:35:05.526 --> 00:35:12.631]  People like HSBC and others are the tip of the spear and saying we don't want to see our ads show up on YouTube.
[00:35:12.631 --> 00:35:26.441]  As a matter of fact, I was kind of curious because I thought about this and it never really occurred to me when I saw ads being served on YouTube videos, the front of the YouTube videos, I never really thought of that as a sponsorship.
[00:35:27.649 --> 00:35:30.430]  Of that particular company, of the content that was there.
[00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:33.890]  I knew there was no conscious coordination there.
[00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:39.871]  So I put a poll up on my Twitter account, Libertarian, because I'm kind of interested in what you think.
[00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:44.792]  It's not like television, where you, they go out and they get a specific sponsor.
[00:35:44.792 --> 00:35:50.893]  They go out and they get General Motors, and they say, you know, we're going to have the GM is going to sponsor this show.
[00:35:50.893 --> 00:35:52.953]  Or back in the old days, they would sponsor the entire thing.
[00:35:52.953 --> 00:35:56.374]  You'd have Borax sponsoring Ronald Reagan on Death Valley days.
[00:35:57.318 --> 00:36:05.064]  Well, you could very clearly say that these people are standing behind everything that's being said on that television show when they do something like that.
[00:36:05.064 --> 00:36:13.029]  But when it's an ad that's being served on YouTube, these are just ads that are coming in at random and they're being thrown up by YouTube.
[00:36:13.029 --> 00:36:19.774]  They're not being thrown up and Google didn't go out, or GM didn't go out there and say, hey, I want to put an ad on David Knight's video.
[00:36:19.774 --> 00:36:21.636]  No, this is just something that went out there by
[00:36:22.216 --> 00:36:34.216]  YouTube so we have the thing monetized there you can see the poll they've pulled that up there at Libertarian if you want to vote on that poll I'm curious as to what you think because I think when I looked at this my take on this
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.361]  Was that they're trying to shut down our revenue.
[00:36:37.361 --> 00:36:39.142]  They're trying to shut down the revenue of third parties.
[00:36:39.142 --> 00:36:52.347]  Anybody that they say is deemed to be controversial, and that would be controversial would be anybody that reports the fact that HSBC has been convicted multiple times of money laundering and gotten off with a slap on the hand each time.
[00:36:52.347 --> 00:37:00.430]  When we talk about that, I guess HSBC sees that as controversial and they would not like to see their ad pop up on a video where I'm talking about that.
[00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:03.011]  They would like to see us go away, quite frankly.
[00:37:03.011 --> 00:37:03.511]  They really would.
[00:37:04.659 --> 00:37:07.562]  And so that's going to be the result of this type of movement.
[00:37:07.562 --> 00:37:13.609]  When they can go out and Facebook can shut down your articles, your videos, your content by saying, well, we think that's fake.
[00:37:13.609 --> 00:37:16.152]  We're going to be the arbiters of what's true and what isn't.
[00:37:16.152 --> 00:37:18.956]  Or we're going to give that to those wizards at Snopes.
[00:37:20.444 --> 00:37:27.290]  Well, they can do that, and they can be the arbiters of truth, and they can shut you down by saying, you're not true, we don't agree with you, blah blah blah.
[00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:28.511]  They can censure you that way.
[00:37:28.511 --> 00:37:31.953]  Or they can come out and say, well, we simply think that it's controversial.
[00:37:31.953 --> 00:37:35.196]  See, they don't even have to go to the point of saying, it's fake.
[00:37:35.196 --> 00:37:39.820]  Now they can just say, it's controversial, so we're going to shut down your revenue.
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:41.241]  We're going to censure your videos.
[00:37:42.369 --> 00:37:44.490]  And of course, they're still letting the videos go out.
[00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:47.911]  They're just cutting down the ad revenue to that.
[00:37:47.911 --> 00:37:51.812]  So we appreciate you standing with us, buying our products directly.
[00:37:51.812 --> 00:37:59.095]  One of the products that we've got as a discount today at InfoWars Life is Brain Force Plus, and it is 25% off.
[00:37:59.095 --> 00:38:08.478]  And as I've said before, it is one of my favorite, if not the favorite, supplement that I have at, that I take out of InfoWars because I can feel it immediately.
[00:38:08.478 --> 00:38:10.239]  Let me read you this review of what somebody else said.
[00:38:10.879 --> 00:38:11.900]  Excellent product.
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.461]  Exceeded my expectations.
[00:38:13.461 --> 00:38:14.342]  I love Brain Force.
[00:38:14.342 --> 00:38:16.224]  It has transformed my productivity at work.
[00:38:16.224 --> 00:38:19.867]  I've been able to replace coffee with this incredible natural alternative.
[00:38:19.867 --> 00:38:25.391]  After long days where I would normally be exhausted, I'm clear-headed and alert.
[00:38:25.391 --> 00:38:27.273]  I highly recommend this to anyone.
[00:38:27.273 --> 00:38:33.118]  There were other benefits that I'll let you discover for yourself, but this is an amazing supplement that has made a huge difference in the quality
[00:38:33.698 --> 00:38:34.278]  Of my life.
[00:38:34.278 --> 00:38:37.039]  And that's by Michael from an undisclosed location.
[00:38:37.039 --> 00:38:40.241]  You can read those reviews at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:38:40.241 --> 00:38:42.782]  You can see what other people are saying about our products.
[00:38:42.782 --> 00:38:43.842]  Take a look at the ingredients.
[00:38:43.842 --> 00:38:45.363]  Do your own research on the internet.
[00:38:46.411 --> 00:38:52.876]  We encourage you to do your own research on not only the stuff that we sell at InfoWarsLive, but also the information that we give you.
[00:38:52.876 --> 00:38:55.918]  Because we give you links to back up what we're talking about.
[00:38:55.918 --> 00:38:58.920]  We're not just making up stuff about the Internet of Things.
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.143]  The fact that your appliances are spying on you.
[00:39:02.143 --> 00:39:04.524]  Yeah, that's not a tinfoil hat conspiracy theory.
[00:39:04.524 --> 00:39:05.325]  We're not paranoid.
[00:39:05.325 --> 00:39:08.307]  We had David Petraeus five years ago saying that was going to be the case.
[00:39:08.307 --> 00:39:08.968]  It is the case!
[00:39:09.795 --> 00:39:11.376]  Samsung has told you that is the case.
[00:39:11.376 --> 00:39:15.040]  So, we back up our articles, we back up the products that we sell.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.202]  You can take a look at that at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:39:17.202 --> 00:39:20.885]  Also, another product I want to mention to you real quickly, then we get back to the news.
[00:39:20.885 --> 00:39:26.931]  We have an all-new Victory Series 2 Minutemen Edition, 80% lower.
[00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:29.753]  That's now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:39:29.753 --> 00:39:30.053]  And again,
[00:39:31.038 --> 00:39:37.905]  This is something that you can get, it's sold by, I'm looking at the name of the company here, yes, Tennessee Arms.
[00:39:37.905 --> 00:39:40.567]  Made exclusively for InfoWars by Tennessee Arms.
[00:39:40.567 --> 00:39:49.696]  Now this is a new design, the Minutemen edition, but we have 20% off all of our other 80% lowers that are available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:39:49.696 --> 00:39:54.200]  Again, it's a great way for you to build your own firearm.
[00:39:55.103 --> 00:40:07.834]  And we have some interesting news about the Second Amendment that I'm going to get to here in a moment, but I don't want to get to that before I finish with the Obamacare repeal that needs to happen, that must happen.
[00:40:07.834 --> 00:40:11.077]  And as I was just talking about, these three phases of repeal.
[00:40:11.077 --> 00:40:15.061]  So they had the first phase, which was going to be a legislative repeal of some things.
[00:40:16.138 --> 00:40:23.288]  But then they said, Phase 2 is going to be done by our wonderful Health and Human Services Secretary, Tom Price.
[00:40:23.288 --> 00:40:32.322]  And he's going to go through and just rip out stuff because Obamacare has established the HHS Secretary as a czar over your health care.
[00:40:33.376 --> 00:40:36.018]  Now, I don't want to see that.
[00:40:36.018 --> 00:40:47.767]  That kind of structure, the mandates, the army of IRS agents who demand to know if you've got health insurance and demand that you get a particular type of health insurance, that's what we're talking about when we say repeal.
[00:40:47.767 --> 00:40:51.690]  And this bill did not do that.
[00:40:51.690 --> 00:41:00.297]  The very fact that they're talking about phase 2 being an essential part of this means that they're leaving in the structure, the dictatorial structure of Obamacare.
[00:41:00.297 --> 00:41:01.317]  We do not want that.
[00:41:01.317 --> 00:41:02.719]  That's not what we voted for.
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.341]  Listen to us.
[00:41:05.341 --> 00:41:15.450]  We don't want our health care being micromanaged out of Washington by a bunch of socialist bureaucrats, and we don't want it being ripped around every time we've got an election.
[00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:19.554]  So one election, some of this stuff is taken out, the next election it'll be put right back in.
[00:41:19.554 --> 00:41:21.055]  Right back in.
[00:41:21.055 --> 00:41:22.777]  When you get Chelsea Clinton as president,
[00:41:23.697 --> 00:41:24.958]  God forbid.
[00:41:24.958 --> 00:41:27.139]  But something like that happens.
[00:41:27.139 --> 00:41:30.401]  What's she going to do with her Health and Human Services Secretary?
[00:41:30.401 --> 00:41:32.183]  Exactly what you don't want to see happen.
[00:41:32.183 --> 00:41:33.544]  And then I was just talking about Phase 3.
[00:41:33.544 --> 00:41:38.547]  They say we're going to allow competition across state lines.
[00:41:38.547 --> 00:41:39.808]  Now, right now, that's prohibited.
[00:41:41.035 --> 00:41:44.558]  The Commerce Clause should prohibit that kind of prohibition.
[00:41:44.558 --> 00:41:58.550]  The Commerce Clause in the Constitution was set up so that we would have free trade within the United States, but isn't it interesting that the very people that are always telling us we have to have free trade with other nations will not allow us to have free trade in health care across borders?
[00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:00.512]  Do you smell a rat?
[00:42:00.512 --> 00:42:03.675]  Do you think they've got cards that they're not showing you?
[00:42:03.675 --> 00:42:04.676]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:42:05.643 --> 00:42:18.996]  If we were to enforce the Commerce Clause, and this could be done by the Justice Department, saying no, as long as these insurance companies are not engaging in fraud, people can choose to buy what they want regardless of where these insurance companies are.
[00:42:18.996 --> 00:42:23.420]  So if it's not fraudulent health care, they should be able to pick and choose what they want.
[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:28.545]  They should not have a gun held to their head and call it essential health benefits.
[00:42:29.505 --> 00:42:37.267]  And say we're going to mandate that single men have to get maternity care or that nuns have to get abortion care and so forth.
[00:42:37.267 --> 00:42:38.507]  That's essential care.
[00:42:38.507 --> 00:42:42.368]  And they said, wait, well, you know, we're going to have some negotiations on that.
[00:42:42.368 --> 00:42:49.529]  At the last minute, they brought the Freedom Caucus in and said, we'll talk about some of these things that are essential health care benefits that we might want to cut.
[00:42:49.529 --> 00:42:50.410]  No, no.
[00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:54.531]  You're rearranging the deck chairs on titanic health care.
[00:42:54.531 --> 00:42:55.631]  It's headed for the iceberg.
[00:42:56.351 --> 00:42:58.533]  And it's not enough to say you're not going to be there.
[00:42:58.533 --> 00:42:59.094]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:59.094 --> 00:43:03.479]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:43:03.479 --> 00:43:14.391]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:43:14.571 --> 00:43:19.613]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:43:19.613 --> 00:43:22.195]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:43:22.195 --> 00:43:23.695]  It helps detoxify.
[00:43:23.695 --> 00:43:26.777]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:43:26.777 --> 00:43:31.559]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:43:31.559 --> 00:43:37.802]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[00:43:37.802 --> 00:43:43.244]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:43:43.244 --> 00:43:43.905]  I'm taking it now.
[00:43:44.445 --> 00:43:47.487]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:43:47.487 --> 00:43:50.550]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:53.552]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:43:53.552 --> 00:43:55.193]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals,
[00:44:08.183 --> 00:44:11.464]  The elite is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:44:11.464 --> 00:44:20.645]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:44:20.645 --> 00:44:28.186]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:44:28.186 --> 00:44:36.208]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:44:36.208 --> 00:44:37.168]  The general public doesn't.
[00:44:38.388 --> 00:44:41.771]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:44:41.771 --> 00:44:45.915]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:44:45.915 --> 00:44:52.621]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:44:52.621 --> 00:44:56.725]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:45:00.029 --> 00:45:05.775]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[00:45:15.692 --> 00:45:21.539]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[00:45:21.539 --> 00:45:27.666]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[00:45:27.666 --> 00:45:33.973]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[00:45:33.973 --> 00:45:36.416]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[00:45:36.676 --> 00:45:37.856]  We're the solution!
[00:45:37.856 --> 00:45:38.857]  Americans!
[00:45:38.857 --> 00:45:40.377]  Ain't nothing more to it than that.
[00:45:40.377 --> 00:45:45.580]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:47.460]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.361]  DVDs now available.
[00:45:49.361 --> 00:45:52.782]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[00:45:52.782 --> 00:45:54.963]  Americans need to see this film.
[00:45:59.725 --> 00:46:02.948]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[00:46:02.948 --> 00:46:05.290]  Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:12.296]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[00:46:12.296 --> 00:46:17.621]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[00:46:17.621 --> 00:46:26.609]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[00:46:27.029 --> 00:46:35.914]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[00:46:35.914 --> 00:46:42.999]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spike Georex herbal processing technique.
[00:46:42.999 --> 00:46:48.382]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs, backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you with the best.
[00:46:48.502 --> 00:46:49.503]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:14.198 --> 00:47:21.715]  Well, my daddy left home when I was three And he didn't leave much to maw and me Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
[00:47:23.812 --> 00:47:33.557]  Now, I don't blame him because he run and hid, but the meanest thing that he ever did was before he left, he went and named me Sue.
[00:47:33.557 --> 00:47:34.077]  There we go.
[00:47:34.077 --> 00:47:36.098]  That's Johnny Cash and a boy named Sue.
[00:47:36.098 --> 00:47:39.219]  And you know that story as he tells it in the song?
[00:47:39.219 --> 00:47:43.421]  His dad, the meanest thing he ever did was to name him Sue.
[00:47:43.421 --> 00:47:45.122]  And it caused one fight after the other.
[00:47:45.122 --> 00:47:50.485]  Of course, if you were to name a boy Sue today, that would be a term of endearment, wouldn't it?
[00:47:50.485 --> 00:47:52.606]  This is the upside-down world we live in today.
[00:47:53.591 --> 00:47:58.277]  So it wouldn't be a problem if you name your boy Sue today or if you get your boy to wear skirts.
[00:47:58.277 --> 00:48:04.264]  But back in the day when we knew where we were, we knew what we were, that was a bit of a problem.
[00:48:04.264 --> 00:48:09.169]  Now we've got a family in Atlanta trying to name their daughter Allah.
[00:48:10.558 --> 00:48:25.341]  And I gotta say, if they're successful in doing this, they are going to create more conflict for her and her life in the world that we live in today, in this world, than Johnny Cash would have had if he had been named Sue.
[00:48:25.341 --> 00:48:31.863]  Because she's gonna have every Muslim gunning for her, because that's basically an affront to their religion.
[00:48:32.591 --> 00:48:37.172]  They do not allow people to name each other Allah in their religion.
[00:48:37.172 --> 00:48:54.458]  But this is a family in Atlanta, and they're going to be suing the state officials because the husband and wife are not married, they don't have the same name, and they want to give this other name as a last name to their daughter.
[00:48:55.583 --> 00:49:05.486]  So, they said that state law says that you've got to use as a surname, as a last name, you have to use one parent or the other or a combination of those two names.
[00:49:05.486 --> 00:49:07.006]  That's the state law.
[00:49:07.006 --> 00:49:08.346]  But they don't want to do that.
[00:49:08.346 --> 00:49:13.648]  And of course they've had some very eccentric names that they came up with before they got to the surname.
[00:49:13.648 --> 00:49:21.670]  The first name was Zalika Graceful Lorena Allah is what they want to call her.
[00:49:22.748 --> 00:49:37.619]  And the state says, okay, you can use all those other names, whatever, you know, Moon Unit, Zappa, but you can't use Allah because it has to be the mother's name or the father's name or a combination of those two names.
[00:49:37.619 --> 00:49:41.942]  And as I just pointed out, as a practical matter, why would you want to do that to your child?
[00:49:41.942 --> 00:49:50.388]  But we now see that the ACLU is going to go to bat for them and is going to get involved in these kind of sensational minutiae that the ACLU always does.
[00:49:51.513 --> 00:50:03.236]  The issues that we have with dragnet surveillance, with the shredding of the Constitution, all that stuff just sails over the ACLU, but whenever they find something that's sensational or something that panders to the radical left...
[00:50:03.936 --> 00:50:13.225]  You can bet that they'll be there in court, especially if they can make money suing Christians or suing jurisdictions because they say that you're exercising Christianity.
[00:50:13.225 --> 00:50:14.105]  No, no, we can't have that.
[00:50:14.105 --> 00:50:16.688]  The ACLU will always be there to fund themselves.
[00:50:16.688 --> 00:50:23.434]  So now they're going to get into this as they ignore the big issues and swallow the camels and strain at the gnats.
[00:50:23.434 --> 00:50:27.518]  We also see another interesting story here out of Winchester, Virginia.
[00:50:28.561 --> 00:50:32.722]  We have Virginia police arrest a guy and show this picture of this guy.
[00:50:32.722 --> 00:50:39.684]  He did a pretty good job of makeup in terms of turning himself into the Joker that Heath Ledger did here.
[00:50:39.684 --> 00:50:44.486]  Virginia police arrest a sword-wielding man who is dressed as the Joker.
[00:50:44.486 --> 00:50:46.106]  This was on the Drudge Report.
[00:50:46.106 --> 00:50:49.648]  They charged him with wearing a mask in public.
[00:50:49.648 --> 00:50:51.348]  That is a felony under state law.
[00:50:51.348 --> 00:50:53.469]  And so when I looked at that, I was like, a mask?
[00:50:53.469 --> 00:50:53.669]  Really?
[00:50:54.808 --> 00:50:56.389]  I mean, it's makeup, okay?
[00:50:56.389 --> 00:50:59.211]  It's not truly a mask.
[00:50:59.211 --> 00:51:16.822]  And the statute, however, says, this is Virginia Code 18.2-422, it shall be unlawful for any person over 16 years of age with the intent to conceal his identity, wear any mask, hood, or other device whereby a substantial portion of the face is hidden.
[00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:24.121]  Well, okay, so if we look at this, this raises some interesting questions because when it says, it's an intent to conceal his identity, it doesn't say criminal intent, just intent to conceal.
[00:51:24.121 --> 00:51:25.701]  So wouldn't that include Berkus?
[00:51:46.072 --> 00:51:49.495]  Because with a burka, you're trying to conceal your identity, right?
[00:51:49.495 --> 00:51:51.537]  You don't want people to see your face.
[00:51:51.537 --> 00:51:54.260]  So, why wouldn't that statute apply to burkas?
[00:51:55.888 --> 00:51:59.130]  Maybe, because the statute says, intent to conceal his identity.
[00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:01.972]  So I guess it's okay for women to conceal their identity?
[00:52:01.972 --> 00:52:02.653]  I don't know.
[00:52:02.653 --> 00:52:06.676]  I think that is his, in the general sense, in that statute.
[00:52:06.676 --> 00:52:08.357]  But I find that very interesting.
[00:52:08.357 --> 00:52:15.882]  I think that it should apply to a burka, and not just to makeup for somebody, no matter how bizarre that story is.
[00:52:15.882 --> 00:52:18.965]  No mention as to what the guy's motives were.
[00:52:18.965 --> 00:52:23.268]  Also, as we're looking at some other lighter news here, kind of touches back again on the
[00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:24.520]  I don't
[00:52:42.862 --> 00:52:44.322]  Male.
[00:52:44.322 --> 00:52:51.304]  Because the government is holding a gun to his head, forcing him to buy that, saying that that is essential health benefits.
[00:52:51.304 --> 00:53:03.146]  And then Congressman Judy Chu from California got on Twitter and was triggered by this and said, cancer is no joke, mammograms save lives, the same reason we pay for prostate exams.
[00:53:03.146 --> 00:53:09.527]  And of course, I'm sure women are being coerced into paying for prostate exams under Obamacare as well.
[00:53:09.527 --> 00:53:11.368]  But I think it's kind of interesting when we look at that.
[00:53:12.088 --> 00:53:28.936]  Because it brings up an interesting point about health care and it's also, when we look at mammograms, we had this other article that came out over the weekend on Drudge Report about dogs being taught to detect breast cancer from a bandage that had merely touched the breast of a woman with a tumor.
[00:53:29.676 --> 00:53:38.286]  So these dogs, you just put this clothing on a woman who has cancer and they can detect it with 100% reliability.
[00:53:38.286 --> 00:53:38.846]  Let me repeat that.
[00:53:38.846 --> 00:53:39.507]  100% reliability.
[00:53:39.507 --> 00:53:40.989]  That is far better than mammograms.
[00:53:44.813 --> 00:53:54.044]  That have both a far less than 100% accuracy, generate both false positives and false negatives in terms of mammograms.
[00:53:54.044 --> 00:53:59.050]  And the dogs don't give you cancer like radiation can do if you have too many mammograms.
[00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:02.254]  So there's been a disagreement in the medical community as to
[00:54:03.325 --> 00:54:08.328]  Not only the efficacy of the mammograms, but also the safety of the mammograms.
[00:54:08.328 --> 00:54:19.115]  But of course, when you have this kind of insurance coverage, everybody's getting them because, hey, it's free and the hospitals say, we want you to have this done because it's another way that they can make money.
[00:54:19.115 --> 00:54:23.318]  See, that's part of the problem with health insurance, folks.
[00:54:23.318 --> 00:54:28.862]  Remember, it was a couple of years ago that the LA Times, I referred to this before, they ran an article and they looked at
[00:54:30.117 --> 00:54:40.462]  The cost of people who had, who were cash patients, versus the cost of people who had health insurance, but they went to the same hospitals, had the same kind of procedures, and they paid their deductible.
[00:54:40.462 --> 00:54:40.962]  And guess what?
[00:54:40.962 --> 00:54:43.143]  The cash patients paid less.
[00:54:43.143 --> 00:54:52.668]  And one of the reasons for that is because they negotiated with the hospitals, but the other part of it is that they're not paying for a lot of unnecessary testing, which they will load up on you.
[00:54:52.668 --> 00:54:55.309]  And I gotta say that not only mammograms, but I had, it had
[00:54:57.401 --> 00:55:04.284]  Life-altering consequences for my mother when she had a diagnostic procedure that caused her to have a stroke.
[00:55:04.284 --> 00:55:06.826]  It was a heart catheterization.
[00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:15.996]  And she didn't feel that it was necessary, and it wasn't necessary at the time, and the doctor even admitted that privately to us, because we did not get into a situation where we sued him.
[00:55:15.996 --> 00:55:18.178]  She was advanced in age at the time.
[00:55:18.178 --> 00:55:26.924]  But she had that stroke while they were doing the procedure to her, blocked off the arterial flow, caused her to have a stroke.
[00:55:26.924 --> 00:55:32.008]  But the bottom line, folks, is that tests have consequences.
[00:55:33.254 --> 00:55:34.835]  Heart catheterizations have consequences.
[00:55:34.835 --> 00:55:36.677]  Mammograms have consequences.
[00:55:36.677 --> 00:55:40.240]  They're not only expensive, but you ought to think about whether you really need those things.
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:44.184]  And they don't push them on you to that extent if you are a cash patient.
[00:55:44.184 --> 00:55:46.966]  When I say I'm a cash patient, I'm a member of Samaritan Ministries.
[00:55:46.966 --> 00:55:48.588]  Of course, there's a lot of these.
[00:55:48.588 --> 00:55:50.469]  There's Christian Care MediShare.
[00:55:50.469 --> 00:55:52.811]  There's Liberty, where you don't have to be a Christian.
[00:55:52.811 --> 00:55:55.274]  These are situations where you share each other's health care.
[00:55:55.834 --> 00:56:02.824]  Where you have a catastrophic insurance policy to fall back on if it's like $50,000 or more, but you can then negotiate.
[00:56:02.824 --> 00:56:04.166]  It's a little bit of a marketplace.
[00:56:04.166 --> 00:56:07.991]  This is why we're talking about a repeal of Obamacare.
[00:56:07.991 --> 00:56:09.533]  Getting rid of these mandates.
[00:56:10.526 --> 00:56:17.192]  And I spend so much time on this because I'm really sad to see the direction this is taking according to some of the headlines.
[00:56:17.192 --> 00:56:24.978]  The fact that Trump and Bannon are so angry about this failing that they are now starting to turn their anger on other Republicans.
[00:56:24.978 --> 00:56:29.142]  We don't want to have a civil war over this.
[00:56:29.142 --> 00:56:31.704]  That's exactly what McCain would love to see.
[00:56:31.704 --> 00:56:37.069]  That's what he's gloating about in the European Union when he's talking to them at Brussels.
[00:56:38.359 --> 00:56:40.020]  We don't want to see that happen.
[00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:47.126]  That's going to not only keep us from getting anything done, it will completely lock the Republicans up in fighting each other.
[00:56:47.126 --> 00:56:48.907]  We share the same goal.
[00:56:48.907 --> 00:56:50.388]  I think the strategy was flawed.
[00:56:50.388 --> 00:56:52.070]  I think the tactics were horrible.
[00:56:52.070 --> 00:56:54.632]  The fact that they were changing things up to the last minute.
[00:56:54.632 --> 00:56:58.775]  The fact that Paul Ryan had this bill as a secret bill.
[00:56:58.775 --> 00:57:00.977]  He's the guy, if you want to blame somebody, blame him.
[00:57:00.977 --> 00:57:02.738]  He didn't want this to pass in the first place.
[00:57:02.738 --> 00:57:03.559]  That was quite obvious.
[00:57:04.383 --> 00:57:12.685]  We couldn't tell up to the last minute whether veterans were going to be made ineligible to receive tax credits under the revision of the plan.
[00:57:12.685 --> 00:57:14.646]  They wanted to rush this thing through.
[00:57:14.646 --> 00:57:16.486]  Nobody wanted to see that happen.
[00:57:16.486 --> 00:57:21.487]  And they didn't address the fundamental things at the bottom of it that were dictatorial.
[00:57:21.487 --> 00:57:25.549]  If you want to blame somebody, blame those tactics, those strategies.
[00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:26.769]  Take a look at what happened with it.
[00:57:27.429 --> 00:57:28.870]  Talk to the other side.
[00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:29.371]  Come back.
[00:57:29.371 --> 00:57:31.352]  You can pass this without the Democrats.
[00:57:31.352 --> 00:57:37.477]  The Democrats can't block it, but you can block it if you go into a civil war with other Republicans.
[00:57:37.477 --> 00:57:37.857]  Stay with us.
[00:57:37.857 --> 00:57:41.480]  When we come right back, we're going to talk about North Dakota and the Second Amendment.
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:44.823]  We're also going to have Alex Jones talking to us at 6 after.
[00:57:44.823 --> 00:57:48.566]  He's going to give an exclusive response to the firestorm concerning his Pizzagate statement.
[00:57:48.566 --> 00:57:49.207]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:49.747 --> 00:57:51.328]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:57:51.328 --> 00:57:56.591]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[00:57:56.591 --> 00:57:59.793]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[00:57:59.793 --> 00:58:05.597]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[00:58:05.597 --> 00:58:11.301]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[00:58:11.721 --> 00:58:14.684]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[00:58:14.684 --> 00:58:20.249]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[00:58:20.249 --> 00:58:27.275]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[00:58:27.275 --> 00:58:31.839]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[00:58:32.099 --> 00:58:35.403]  Go to PrivatePowerGrid.com to watch this thing in action.

[01:00:11.927 --> 01:00:16.572]  This is our land.
[01:00:16.572 --> 01:00:19.895]  These are our people.
[01:00:19.895 --> 01:00:20.596]  The workers.
[01:00:21.943 --> 01:00:26.824]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:00:51.688 --> 01:00:56.749]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:56.749 --> 01:01:04.351]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday, March 26, 2017.
[01:01:04.351 --> 01:01:12.873]  I'm David Knight, and as I said as we're going to break, we've got some important news about the Second Amendment.
[01:01:12.873 --> 01:01:14.914]  This is a story that's on Infowars.com.
[01:01:14.914 --> 01:01:16.794]  It's originally from Breitbart.
[01:01:16.794 --> 01:01:20.315]  North Dakota says the Second Amendment is your concealed carry permit.
[01:01:21.271 --> 01:01:23.054]  And they're absolutely right.
[01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:28.482]  You must have a valid ID and notify law enforcement of the weapon during instances such as a traffic stop.
[01:01:28.482 --> 01:01:31.847]  But other than that, you don't need to get permission.
[01:01:31.847 --> 01:01:34.131]  See, it's a God-given right to protect yourself.
[01:01:35.327 --> 01:01:37.629]  And it's not given by the Constitution, even.
[01:01:37.629 --> 01:01:47.975]  The Constitution recognizes your God-given rights and the Bill of Rights, and then it has prohibitions throughout the Constitution so that the government can't take away those God-given rights.
[01:01:47.975 --> 01:01:52.338]  And the way they take them away is by turning them into privileges.
[01:01:52.338 --> 01:01:52.919]  Privileges!
[01:01:54.039 --> 01:01:56.101]  I mean, there's a lot of different ways that they can do that.
[01:01:56.101 --> 01:02:01.364]  I remember when I had a business, when I first started my business, and I found that I had to get a privilege license.
[01:02:01.364 --> 01:02:03.026]  And I said, isn't that interesting?
[01:02:03.026 --> 01:02:10.551]  I have to get a, it's a privilege to start a business, but other people have a right to welfare.
[01:02:10.551 --> 01:02:11.712]  Hmm.
[01:02:11.712 --> 01:02:13.353]  Isn't that interesting?
[01:02:13.353 --> 01:02:15.875]  It all is in the terminology, isn't it, folks?
[01:02:15.875 --> 01:02:16.736]  I talk about privilege.
[01:02:16.736 --> 01:02:22.580]  Of course, now, if you're white, you're privileged, and you've got to get special permission to even open your mouth from the leftists.
[01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:25.864]  This is also important.
[01:02:25.864 --> 01:02:29.585]  This House bill, when it was put up, listen to the vote margins that they had there.
[01:02:29.585 --> 01:02:38.188]  In North Dakota, it passed the House by 83-9 to say that the Constitution is your concealed carry permit, Second Amendment.
[01:02:38.188 --> 01:02:40.429]  That passed by 83-9 in the House.
[01:02:40.429 --> 01:02:43.570]  It passed by 34-13 in the Senate.
[01:02:43.570 --> 01:02:50.673]  So it was nearly unanimous in the House, and it was almost 3-1 in the Senate.
[01:02:50.673 --> 01:02:52.274]  That's great news, folks.
[01:02:52.274 --> 01:02:52.694]  Great news.
[01:02:53.274 --> 01:02:56.855]  And I think it's a pattern that we need to see happening elsewhere.
[01:02:56.855 --> 01:03:01.836]  Not just on the Second Amendment, but on all of our freedoms.
[01:03:01.836 --> 01:03:04.497]  I think we need to take our freedoms back at the state level.
[01:03:04.497 --> 01:03:07.818]  You're not going to have somebody in Washington give that up.
[01:03:07.818 --> 01:03:09.418]  It's Washington that's taking them.
[01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:15.620]  It's Washington that is the swamp that's not only draining your pocketbook, but the swamp is draining your freedoms.
[01:03:16.462 --> 01:03:17.882]  Draining your liberty!
[01:03:17.882 --> 01:03:19.703]  So you're not going to have them give this up.
[01:03:19.703 --> 01:03:22.984]  You're going to take it back, state by state.
[01:03:22.984 --> 01:03:25.425]  By exercising the Constitution.
[01:03:25.425 --> 01:03:27.746]  Exercising your sovereignty.
[01:03:27.746 --> 01:03:29.866]  And Washington is basically gone.
[01:03:29.866 --> 01:03:31.047]  You gotta forget it, folks.
[01:03:31.906 --> 01:03:37.190]  You've got the, as I pointed out before, the Congress has abdicated its authority to make laws to the bureaucracy.
[01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:56.527]  All they do is create a new bureaucracy, or they create a sweeping bank reform from Dodd and Frank, and turn this over to some newly created institution, and they will go in and create all the rules and regulations and laws, and they will assess fines and penalties against you, and all the protections of the Bill of Rights will not apply.
[01:03:56.527 --> 01:04:00.150]  The presumption of innocence does not apply to their regulatory law.
[01:04:01.038 --> 01:04:05.520]  The idea that you're going to have a trial before they assess a penalty, that doesn't apply.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:11.043]  They say that it is a civil action and they can take from you immediately whatever they wish.
[01:04:11.043 --> 01:04:12.484]  You have to prove that you're innocent.
[01:04:12.484 --> 01:04:15.705]  You have to sue them to get your property back.
[01:04:15.705 --> 01:04:21.968]  And the prohibition against excessive fines, they say, well that doesn't apply either because this is civil, not criminal.
[01:04:21.968 --> 01:04:25.130]  And that's what they do with the war on drugs, the civil asset forfeiture.
[01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:26.631]  So the way we're going to take this stuff back
[01:04:27.645 --> 01:04:30.646]  A state-by-state, issue-by-issue.
[01:04:30.646 --> 01:04:32.547]  It has to be done at the state level.
[01:04:32.547 --> 01:04:38.188]  And this situation in North Dakota is exactly, exactly the way it has to happen.
[01:04:38.188 --> 01:04:40.549]  Now coming up next, we're going to have Alex Jones.
[01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:46.131]  This is going to be his exclusive response to the firestorm concerning this Pizzagate statement that he made on Friday.
[01:04:46.131 --> 01:04:48.531]  He'll be right back with the rest of the story.
[01:04:48.531 --> 01:04:48.932]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.156 --> 01:05:06.839]  Appearing on the Drudge Report this morning, potential smoking gun showed Obama administration spied on Trump team, source says.
[01:05:06.839 --> 01:05:16.644]  Republican congressional investigators expect a potential smoking gun establishing that the Obama administration spied on the Trump transition team and possibly the president-elect himself.
[01:05:16.644 --> 01:05:19.445]  Intelligence Committee Chair David Nunes from California
[01:05:19.645 --> 01:05:23.368]  ...has said he expects that the NSA will provide him this smoking gun evidence.
[01:05:23.368 --> 01:05:33.795]  The intelligence is said to leave no doubt that the Obama administration in its closing days was using the cover of legitimate surveillance on foreign targets to spy on President-elect Trump, according to sources.
[01:05:33.795 --> 01:05:35.736]  And basically, it boils down to this.
[01:05:35.736 --> 01:05:41.600]  While it's legal for the deep state to collect intelligence on foreign targets, it's not legal for the names of U.S.
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.241]  citizens to be unmasked.
[01:05:43.241 --> 01:05:46.123]  This was done and was disseminated through intelligence reports.
[01:05:46.363 --> 01:05:51.806]  Now looking back at Trump's March 4th wiretapping tweets, it seems he was right all along.
[01:05:51.806 --> 01:05:56.248]  Soon we will find out if Obama administration officials are too big to jail.
[01:05:56.248 --> 01:06:06.294]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:06:06.294 --> 01:06:12.337]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:12.337 --> 01:06:14.859]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:20.675 --> 01:06:40.762]  On Friday, I issued a statement on InfoWars.com, but also broadcast on my daily show, basically clarifying my position concerning what has become known as the Pizzagate controversy, and apologizing to James Aliphanos of Comet Ping Pong Pizza in D.C.
[01:06:40.762 --> 01:06:42.582]  Now, why did I do that?
[01:06:42.582 --> 01:06:49.705]  Because I am preparing to go on the offense against real child traffickers and those abusing children.
[01:06:50.828 --> 01:07:14.663]  And because, going back to December 1st of last year, I have told my crew at InfoWars that I believed this to be a manufactured controversy by MSM to discredit those researching and exposing the epidemic across the world of powerful elites and others abusing and exploiting children.
[01:07:15.734 --> 01:07:25.138]  So please take notes and research for yourself the bombshell information I'm about to cover.
[01:07:25.138 --> 01:07:37.402]  In early November of 2016, we began to get exclusive information from law enforcement giving us tips into open source areas to research.
[01:07:37.402 --> 01:07:43.405]  And it dealt with the Clintons and with prominent members of the Democratic Party, admittedly
[01:07:44.165 --> 01:07:50.569]  Going to Aleister Crowley events and the bizarre information inside the WikiLeaks emails.
[01:07:50.569 --> 01:07:52.811]  We didn't know exactly what to make of it.
[01:07:52.811 --> 01:07:55.513]  But our law enforcement sources in New York and New Jersey said...
[01:07:56.730 --> 01:08:04.756]  Watch, Anthony Weiner is going to be investigated for child porn on his phone and contacting minors.
[01:08:04.756 --> 01:08:08.878]  We were the first to report that because we had sources.
[01:08:08.878 --> 01:08:18.865]  But before we could get all that information looked at, suddenly people on online message boards and forums began to get distracted to a pizza place in DC.
[01:08:19.966 --> 01:08:34.754]  Then MSNBC, CNN, you name it, The Washington Post, New York Times, they focused on Comic Ping Pong because there have been code words in New York concerning pizza that law enforcement was saying was connected to possible child pornography and trafficking.
[01:08:35.799 --> 01:08:37.000]  That was separate.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:43.323]  So MSM began to focus on a pizza place that did have some prominent Democrats going to it.
[01:08:43.323 --> 01:08:56.211]  What we now know is an attempt to distract everyone on to the probably completely innocent pizza place away from the bombshell information unfolding in New York and other areas.
[01:08:56.211 --> 01:09:00.994]  So as soon as I began to figure that out, long before I was attacked in MSM for covering it,
[01:09:01.414 --> 01:09:08.157]  Long before Mr. Alifanis sent me a letter just a month ago saying he liked me to retract, I clicked to it.
[01:09:08.157 --> 01:09:19.401]  Why was everybody focusing on this pizza place and not on all the incredible bombshells we saw happening in New York, Hawaii, California, you name it?
[01:09:19.401 --> 01:09:20.041]  So to be clear,
[01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:30.716]  The reason I put this letter out to Mr. Alifanis is because I believe he and his employees are innocent people and have been sucked into this, just like I've been sucked into it.
[01:09:30.716 --> 01:09:35.079]  And if MSM would just be honest, they could track back and see this for themselves.
[01:09:35.079 --> 01:09:39.501]  But regardless, I did this because it's the right thing to do.
[01:09:39.501 --> 01:09:46.165]  Just like by December 1st, I clicked to what was going on and have been proven right yet again.
[01:09:46.165 --> 01:09:48.266]  So let's walk through the atmosphere.
[01:09:48.866 --> 01:09:57.560]  And the news that we were looking at in November and December, and why there was so much hysteria concerning what was happening in the Washington, D.C.
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:57.801]  area.
[01:10:03.726 --> 01:10:22.837]  In early December, I distanced myself, my crew, and InfoWars.com from the entire Pizzagate narrative because I realized it was distracting from hardcore confirmed news reports of children being abused and sexually assaulted on a mass scale.
[01:10:22.837 --> 01:10:30.182]  I distanced myself from it because it was clearly a contrived distraction from the real crimes taking place.
[01:10:31.147 --> 01:10:43.719]  Less than a day and a half after putting out my clarification slash retraction, thousands of publications, hundreds of TV stations and major networks have picked up my retraction, many of them twisting it.
[01:10:43.719 --> 01:10:50.465]  It'll be interesting to see if in the interest of children, they actually report now on what we're about to break down.
[01:10:51.345 --> 01:10:53.627]  Here's the headline out of town hall.
[01:10:53.627 --> 01:10:58.750]  Why the MSM is ignoring Trump's sex trafficking bust that are massive.
[01:10:58.750 --> 01:11:02.172]  We're going to get to that here in just a few minutes.
[01:11:02.172 --> 01:11:17.323]  But first, let's look at some of the things that have happened in just the last few years of why when we saw the Podesta emails come out in New York and when law enforcement was telling us they were investigating it for code words and connection to child abuse.
[01:11:17.663 --> 01:11:21.885]  Very, very serious alleged child abuse that we took it so seriously.
[01:11:21.885 --> 01:11:25.046]  Here's some of the headlines with people associated with the Clintons.
[01:11:25.046 --> 01:11:33.389]  Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire pedophile convicted with links to Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey, Robert Maxwell, and Prince Andrew.
[01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:34.749]  And there's more coming up.
[01:11:34.749 --> 01:11:39.191]  The sex slave scandal that exposed pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:11:40.424 --> 01:11:44.465]  That's who Bill Clinton and others are flying around with, going to this pedophile island.
[01:11:44.465 --> 01:11:45.446]  All this is happening.
[01:11:45.446 --> 01:11:49.047]  It ties into the same usual suspects.
[01:11:49.047 --> 01:12:01.210]  We've got Savelle in England, again tied to the Royal Family, and all the massive admitted sex abuse going on there, including Satanism, Aleister Crowley stuff.
[01:12:01.210 --> 01:12:05.292]  We've got Laura Silsby, who works for the, or did work for the Clinton
[01:12:06.052 --> 01:12:06.412]  I think?
[01:12:28.696 --> 01:12:33.699]  Using blood, semen, breast milk, you name it.
[01:12:33.699 --> 01:12:41.365]  And this is the type of stuff that was going on in New York with Podesta in the emails, Anthony Weiner connected to it, Uma Abedin, you name it.
[01:12:58.956 --> 01:12:59.577]  Anthony Weiner.
[01:13:08.351 --> 01:13:17.274]  Downing Street and Scotland Yard saying national pedophile scandal at the highest levels of government may bring down the whole country.
[01:13:17.274 --> 01:13:19.814]  A giant pedophile network's in control.
[01:13:19.814 --> 01:13:25.736]  We're reading this in major newspapers, then seeing it in WikiLeaks and trying to investigate it.
[01:13:25.736 --> 01:13:29.017]  Police launch criminal investigation into MP's child sex ring.
[01:13:30.117 --> 01:13:38.745]  Jimmy Savelle was part of satanic ring, children dying, sex with dead children, satanic rituals, royal family.
[01:13:38.745 --> 01:13:41.107]  Mainstream news, folks.
[01:13:41.107 --> 01:13:42.488]  Then, Trump gets in.
[01:13:42.488 --> 01:13:46.291]  Just as we've been told by law enforcement, he was planning to go after him.
[01:13:46.291 --> 01:13:53.858]  474 arrested, 28 sexually exploited children rescued in bondage during statewide human trafficking operation.
[01:13:53.858 --> 01:13:54.638]  That was February 1st.
[01:13:56.670 --> 01:13:58.452]  We told you those busts were coming.
[01:13:58.452 --> 01:13:59.333]  So now you know.
[01:13:59.333 --> 01:14:12.587]  I'm not going to let the media, because some internet trolls focused on some pizza place, distract serious investigations away from what's really happening and give real networks the cover they're looking for
[01:14:13.288 --> 01:14:24.296]  To demonize the idea that any children are being exploited, that any children are being kidnapped, that any children are being raped, that any children are being killed, when we know this has come out tens of thousands of times.
[01:14:24.296 --> 01:14:26.338]  And that's what the media has done now.
[01:14:26.338 --> 01:14:31.762]  I see them ridiculing people claiming the Catholic Church has abused or raped kids, or covered it up.
[01:14:31.762 --> 01:14:37.246]  I'm now hearing forget what happened with Penn State and Sandusky, and now his son being arrested.
[01:14:37.246 --> 01:14:39.108]  I'm hearing just, it doesn't exist.
[01:14:40.029 --> 01:14:55.939]  The exploitation of children is a conspiracy theory, while NAMBLA, the North American Man-Boy Love Association, has been accepted by the UN as an NGO, and now leftist groups, even Salon, are pushing saying legalized pedophilia.
[01:14:55.939 --> 01:15:00.882]  The very groups that criticize us and say it doesn't exist.
[01:15:00.882 --> 01:15:08.127]  Now you begin to see exactly why early on, I clicked weeks into it, exactly what was happening.
[01:15:09.192 --> 01:15:10.293]  Look at these headlines.
[01:15:10.293 --> 01:15:15.257]  After exposure of pedophiles, BBC StarPub widens to UK Parliament.
[01:15:15.257 --> 01:15:19.021]  Missing black girls in DC sparks outrage, prompts calls for federal help.
[01:15:19.021 --> 01:15:21.863]  The police say black girls are getting grabbed out in the street.
[01:15:21.863 --> 01:15:25.987]  But a week later, the news says, conspiracy theory, they all ran away.
[01:15:26.886 --> 01:15:28.347]  Well, let's say most of them ran away.
[01:15:28.347 --> 01:15:29.307]  What happened to all the others?
[01:15:29.307 --> 01:15:32.889]  But they always say it's a runaway, don't they?
[01:15:32.889 --> 01:15:35.191]  Again, to be clear, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand this.
[01:15:35.191 --> 01:15:41.694]  You just gotta pull back and look at all the evidence and everything that's happening to see how clear it is.
[01:15:41.694 --> 01:15:43.916]  And by late November, I was already telling Crube,
[01:15:44.992 --> 01:15:57.382]  This is a honeypot, it's a distraction from all the real admitted stuff with Haiti and Epstein and the Clintons and the UN and people working for the foundation.
[01:15:59.375 --> 01:16:06.842]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.

[01:18:06.292 --> 01:18:07.133]  I take this.
[01:18:07.133 --> 01:18:08.254]  My family takes this.

[01:18:17.145 --> 01:18:21.767]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[01:18:21.767 --> 01:18:22.908]  I don't feel good.
[01:18:22.908 --> 01:18:26.669]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[01:18:26.669 --> 01:18:29.350]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:35.153]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[01:18:35.153 --> 01:18:38.114]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[01:18:38.114 --> 01:18:41.656]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[01:18:41.656 --> 01:18:43.877]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[01:18:43.877 --> 01:18:44.237]  I love it.
[01:18:44.397 --> 01:18:47.199]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[01:18:47.199 --> 01:18:48.220]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:53.865]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[01:18:53.865 --> 01:18:56.047]  It's got a five-star rating.
[01:18:56.047 --> 01:18:58.089]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[01:19:00.131 --> 01:19:01.972]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[01:19:01.972 --> 01:19:08.576]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[01:19:08.576 --> 01:19:11.737]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[01:19:11.737 --> 01:19:21.523]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great-tasting formula.
[01:19:21.523 --> 01:19:22.363]  Caveman.
[01:19:22.363 --> 01:19:27.426]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[01:19:27.426 --> 01:19:29.547]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[01:19:29.847 --> 01:19:32.989]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[01:19:32.989 --> 01:19:38.131]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[01:19:38.131 --> 01:19:46.275]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[01:19:46.275 --> 01:19:54.059]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[01:19:54.059 --> 01:19:58.881]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in 4WarsLife.com today.
[01:20:03.547 --> 01:20:09.709]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:09.709 --> 01:20:11.990]  Again, to be clear, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand this.
[01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:18.371]  You've just got to pull back and look at all the evidence and everything that's happening to see how clear it is.
[01:20:18.371 --> 01:20:30.095]  And by late November, I was already telling Crube, this is a honeypot, it's a distraction from all the real admitted stuff with Haiti and Epstein and the Clintons and
[01:20:31.229 --> 01:20:37.351]  The UN and people working for the foundation being convicted of child trafficking.
[01:20:37.351 --> 01:20:52.275]  And then boom, sure enough, by the middle of December, after I'd already completely distanced ourselves from this and had been the first in the alternative news community to say this is wrong, this comet ping pong thing is a distraction.
[01:20:52.275 --> 01:20:57.677]  We got singled out by Megyn Kelly on Fox News, NPR, you name it.
[01:20:58.792 --> 01:21:19.567]  By editing clips of where I was saying to our audience, I don't know about sex rings, I don't know about Hillary actually being involved in that, but funding Libya, funding the Syria invasion, killed hundreds of thousands of people, tens of thousands of kids, and even top lawyers say she's a war criminal, and bragged about all the things she did in Libya, and Madeleine Albright and the 500,000 dead kids.
[01:21:19.567 --> 01:21:23.170]  So right there isn't just child abuse, it's child murder.
[01:21:24.306 --> 01:21:30.009]  Hillary Clinton is one of the most vicious serial killers the planet's ever seen.
[01:21:30.009 --> 01:21:33.231]  Now there's a twist to that.
[01:21:33.231 --> 01:21:38.694]  Am I talking about the devil worship story with her chief of staff, her campaign chairman?
[01:21:38.694 --> 01:21:43.956]  Looking at the menu of blood and semen and body parts at the Alistair Crowley event?
[01:21:43.956 --> 01:21:45.117]  The private event?
[01:21:45.117 --> 01:21:46.758]  Oh no, I'm not talking about that.
[01:21:46.758 --> 01:21:50.620]  I mean 200,000 plus dead Christians with her operation with Syria.
[01:21:51.460 --> 01:22:07.351]  And our operation in Libya and not letting the Christians get out and directing Al-Qaeda and ISIS who target and murder children and put them through sex slavery and throw Catholic priests off cliffs and kill people en masse and murder gays and everything else you can imagine because they don't like peaceful people.
[01:22:08.427 --> 01:22:09.447]  And they con everybody.
[01:22:09.447 --> 01:22:12.469]  They're for open society, and they love everybody.
[01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:15.110]  Anything they do is for degradation.
[01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:21.613]  InfoWars Alex Jones, a far-right web host, posted a YouTube video seen almost 500,000 times.
[01:22:21.613 --> 01:22:29.136]  When I think about all the children Hillary Clinton has personally murdered, and shot up, and raped, I have zero fear standing up against her.
[01:22:34.238 --> 01:22:35.859]  So you just saw it for yourself.
[01:22:35.859 --> 01:22:44.985]  We clearly were talking about Libya and Syria, but they think you're so stupid, they took it and broadcast it again.
[01:22:46.207 --> 01:22:51.591]  Saying that I was saying Hillary was torturing people in the bottom of the DC Pizza Place.
[01:22:51.591 --> 01:22:53.692]  Now that makes me look bad.
[01:22:53.692 --> 01:22:56.014]  That makes people in the street mad at me.
[01:22:56.014 --> 01:22:58.916]  And also a lot of folks don't trust MSM.
[01:22:58.916 --> 01:23:13.286]  So they use my credibility twisted on Fox News, on NPR, and a bunch of other channels to have me say that it was literally happening, when I didn't, to then actually create more hysteria and send more people to go to Comet Ping Pong.
[01:23:13.786 --> 01:23:15.008]  See how that works?
[01:23:15.008 --> 01:23:26.921]  They edit what I say, rebroadcast it, then the controversy only gets worse and they blame me in the independent press and then call for censorship and the shutdown of our free society.
[01:23:26.921 --> 01:23:28.864]  Now of the hundreds of publications
[01:23:29.912 --> 01:23:36.560]  That openly lied and said that I said that Hillary was torturing people in the bottom of a non-existent basement.
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:39.684]  Only the Washington Post, as bad as they are, told the truth.
[01:23:39.684 --> 01:23:46.632]  Now, they quoted me out of context and said that I said Hillary was killing kids, but then they said he later tied it back to Syria.
[01:23:46.772 --> 01:23:50.654]  No, I did it in the same one minute clip you've already seen.
[01:23:50.654 --> 01:23:57.316]  That's why they always only put audio up on screen and not video because it looks so edited if they actually show the chopped up clip.
[01:23:57.316 --> 01:24:03.999]  But the story where the Washington Post got it right was Pizzagate from rumor to hashtag to gunfire in D.C.
[01:24:03.999 --> 01:24:07.581]  But in this they admit that I was talking about Syria, not D.C.
[01:24:09.312 --> 01:24:12.794]  And that's why the public doesn't trust establishment media.
[01:24:12.794 --> 01:24:13.454]  They distort.
[01:24:13.454 --> 01:24:32.184]  Not only did Megyn Kelly and others take out of context what I was saying about Hillary and her war crimes, they then also covered up the fact that I was exposing admitted war crimes, where Madeleine Albright admitted that 500,000 Iraqi children died under her, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton sanctions, that that was okay.
[01:24:32.184 --> 01:24:34.666]  We have heard that half a million children have died.
[01:24:35.407 --> 01:24:40.473]  I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima.
[01:24:40.473 --> 01:24:44.679]  And, you know, is the price worth it?
[01:24:44.679 --> 01:24:49.245]  I think this is a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it.
[01:24:50.166 --> 01:24:59.017]  And, of course, Hillary making jokes about what happened with the massive deaths that took place when she launched that entire operation that created a failed state in Libya.
[01:24:59.017 --> 01:25:04.023]  So, I mean, that is the land of unconfirmed... Yes, we came, we saw, he died.
[01:25:04.023 --> 01:25:07.767]  Did it have anything to do with your visit?
[01:25:07.767 --> 01:25:09.009]  No, I'm sure it did.
[01:25:10.690 --> 01:25:20.041]  So, if they don't care about all these kids being enslaved by ISIS and Al-Qaeda, if they don't care about them being killed, then how do you think they don't care about kids in Haiti or other places?
[01:25:20.041 --> 01:25:23.905]  This illustrates how cold-blooded these people are.
[01:25:23.905 --> 01:25:31.434]  In closing, my entire system, my entire economy, is about being genuine and telling the truth.
[01:25:32.119 --> 01:25:35.761]  I said there were no WNDs in Iraq in 2003.
[01:25:35.761 --> 01:25:38.863]  I told you Donald Trump was going to win the election and the polls were fake.
[01:25:38.863 --> 01:25:46.448]  I told you that household appliances were having spy systems put into them 15 years ago because I have the schematics.
[01:25:46.448 --> 01:25:48.229]  It's now on the news.
[01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:50.891]  The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, we're cutting edge.
[01:25:50.891 --> 01:25:53.473]  We're trailblazers at InfoWars.
[01:25:53.473 --> 01:25:58.676]  And my whole world is about telling the truth and being honest and having integrity.
[01:25:58.676 --> 01:26:01.258]  And that's why when I saw us being sucked in
[01:26:02.574 --> 01:26:08.399]  To MSM picking up the most obscure rumors online and magnifying it.
[01:26:08.399 --> 01:26:10.941]  And I saw us then reporting on it.
[01:26:10.941 --> 01:26:16.585]  I had everything we'd put up removed because I didn't want to add fuel to the fire.
[01:26:16.585 --> 01:26:21.730]  And I went on TV and the radio in early December and I told our listeners it was a distraction.
[01:26:23.015 --> 01:26:32.021]  But of course, MSM is still out there lying, claiming that I just retracted all of this because Alifana sent me a letter.
[01:26:32.021 --> 01:26:46.731]  No, I openly, officially retracted and apologized because that's a way of clearly cutting off the lies, saying that I'm promoting this damn thing when since December 1st, I've been publicly against it.
[01:26:46.731 --> 01:26:52.735]  And I can sleep good at night knowing that all of that will come out when there's a true investigation
[01:26:53.195 --> 01:26:56.158]  Or if there's any court action.
[01:26:56.158 --> 01:26:58.860]  I stand on the truth and nothing more.
[01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:10.511]  And I'm not gonna let the exploiters of children, like Mr. Epstein and Bill Clinton, who's clearly involved, and others, sit there and distract and divert to a lower politico.
[01:27:11.397 --> 01:27:14.279]  Who I believe they've been using all along.
[01:27:14.279 --> 01:27:16.640]  Just like they've been using me.
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:18.522]  And that's why I'm angry.
[01:27:18.522 --> 01:27:20.363]  And that's why I'm speaking out.
[01:27:20.363 --> 01:27:23.925]  And that's why I'm telling the truth about what happened.
[01:27:23.925 --> 01:27:25.266]  To some of our viewers and others.
[01:27:26.701 --> 01:27:31.383]  The abuse of children and exploitation and their sexual abuse is very serious.
[01:27:31.383 --> 01:27:49.573]  So when you go with half-baked conspiracies and when you run around and say that I'm covering all this up because I'm trying to actually go for the truth, you add to the hysteria and you create a smokescreen that distracts from the real bonafide meat and potatoes issues that we can prove.
[01:27:50.481 --> 01:27:55.454]  And then that gives political cover to the real child abusers that are there.
[01:27:55.454 --> 01:27:58.140]  That said though, we're going to start making a major...
[01:27:59.338 --> 01:28:05.083]  Concerted professional focus on the exploitation of children, sex trafficking and more.
[01:28:05.083 --> 01:28:15.971]  We've always done it, but now we have a true duty to make this our focus to go after the real research and the real court cases and the real admissions that are there.
[01:28:15.971 --> 01:28:21.456]  So to all the pedophiles and all the scum and all the controllers out there who think
[01:28:22.156 --> 01:28:30.801]  That they're going to use these distractions and these mainstream media lies to have a smokescreen to abuse children.
[01:28:30.801 --> 01:28:40.467]  InfoWars is going on the offensive against the organizations that are known and documented, like the United Nations and others, to be involved in this.
[01:28:40.467 --> 01:28:47.271]  And I want to ask our viewers and listeners to understand, it is now more important than ever that you go out and continue your important research.
[01:28:47.271 --> 01:28:48.731]  Keep your eyes and ears open.
[01:28:48.731 --> 01:28:50.893]  I'm Alex Jones and this is the InfoWars.
[01:28:59.062 --> 01:28:59.883]  Hey, everyone!
[01:28:59.883 --> 01:29:02.164]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:29:02.164 --> 01:29:06.026]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:29:06.026 --> 01:29:08.088]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:29:08.088 --> 01:29:18.374]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:29:18.374 --> 01:29:24.358]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:29:24.818 --> 01:29:39.735]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[01:29:39.775 --> 01:29:40.175]  I think so.
[01:30:00.239 --> 01:30:02.080]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:08.683]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[01:30:08.683 --> 01:30:11.845]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[01:30:11.845 --> 01:30:21.629]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[01:30:21.629 --> 01:30:22.470]  Caveman.
[01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:27.532]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[01:30:27.532 --> 01:30:29.633]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[01:30:29.953 --> 01:30:33.094]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:38.236]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[01:30:38.236 --> 01:30:46.380]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:54.323]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[01:30:54.323 --> 01:30:58.985]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself at InfoWarsLive.com today.

[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:28.482]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:31:28.482 --> 01:31:34.984]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.

[01:31:55.374 --> 01:31:59.697]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for auto-ship.
[01:31:59.697 --> 01:32:07.684]  InfoWars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:32:07.684 --> 01:32:11.988]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing
[01:32:11.988 --> 01:32:12.869]  We're good to go.
[01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:37.982]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[01:32:37.982 --> 01:32:38.763]  It works.
[01:32:38.763 --> 01:32:47.086]  Defender body armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[01:32:47.086 --> 01:32:56.949]  Defender body armor is now available through InfowarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Infowar against the globalists all at the same time.
[01:32:56.949 --> 01:32:57.430]  A total 360 win.
[01:33:03.186 --> 01:33:21.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:29.666]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:33.729 --> 01:33:35.109]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:35.109 --> 01:33:36.250]  This is Sunday, March 26, 2017.
[01:33:36.250 --> 01:33:38.650]  I'm David Knight.
[01:33:38.650 --> 01:33:42.571]  We're going to talk about Uber, and we're going to talk about their surveillance state, because that's the background of this, folks.
[01:33:42.571 --> 01:33:44.351]  That and Agenda 21.
[01:33:44.351 --> 01:33:45.752]  That's what this is all about.
[01:33:45.752 --> 01:33:48.152]  And of course, there was just this accident with Uber.
[01:33:48.152 --> 01:33:51.033]  But before we do, I'm just looking at the screen here.
[01:33:51.033 --> 01:33:52.553]  The Drudge Report's got the top of it.
[01:33:52.553 --> 01:33:54.594]  Trump court Democrats.
[01:33:54.594 --> 01:33:56.034]  And is now opening the door to them.
[01:33:57.247 --> 01:33:58.008]  Well, why not?
[01:33:58.008 --> 01:34:12.963]  Because, of course, he worked with the establishment GOP and Paul Ryan, who is on the same track as the Democrats, driving the titanic health care into the iceberg as they come out and say, we're going to rearrange a few of the deck chairs here.
[01:34:12.963 --> 01:34:14.825]  Don't worry, we're going to rearrange some deck chairs.
[01:34:14.825 --> 01:34:16.847]  Well, we don't even know if they're going to do that.
[01:34:16.847 --> 01:34:19.029]  But look, as I said before, and we've got
[01:34:20.069 --> 01:34:24.652]  Somebody from the House Freedom Caucus has now abandoned it.
[01:34:24.652 --> 01:34:29.955]  Congressman Poe is now out of the House Freedom Caucus because the heat has gotten too much for him.
[01:34:29.955 --> 01:34:32.956]  You know, we don't need sunshine patriots like Poe.
[01:34:32.956 --> 01:34:36.038]  We need some winter soldiers who will declare their intention.
[01:34:36.038 --> 01:34:46.024]  Every time I criticize something like this, which I think is a bad strategy, a bad tactic, I think Trump's goal is still get rid of Obamacare, but I think the tactic and the strategy was bad.
[01:34:46.744 --> 01:34:48.565]  I think he allied himself with the wrong people.
[01:34:48.565 --> 01:34:51.067]  He shouldn't have allied himself with Paul Ryan.
[01:34:51.067 --> 01:34:56.970]  He should have allied himself with the House Freedom Caucus and people who really understood what the issue was here.
[01:34:56.970 --> 01:35:00.192]  Every time I say that I hear people say, well, he's playing four-dimensional chess.
[01:35:01.343 --> 01:35:01.603]  Maybe.
[01:35:01.603 --> 01:35:21.280]  I would like to see somebody that is honestly going to declare the principles and the intentions and is going to sign really large their John Hancock in defiance of these kings and dictators instead of enthroning somebody like a health and human secretary to sit there and decide for us what our health care is going to be.
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:23.201]  That's what Obamacare did.
[01:35:23.201 --> 01:35:28.125]  Along with the mandates of what you have to buy, along with the taxes that they imposed on you, they established a king
[01:35:28.826 --> 01:35:31.631]  With HHS to tell you what your health care is going to be.
[01:35:31.631 --> 01:35:33.073]  That needs to be repealed.
[01:35:33.073 --> 01:35:33.954]  That has to be taken off.
[01:35:34.926 --> 01:35:35.827]  You cannot have that.
[01:35:35.827 --> 01:35:38.368]  You can't use that as an instrument of reform.
[01:35:38.368 --> 01:35:42.331]  Reform begins by getting rid of the king of health care.
[01:35:42.331 --> 01:35:43.231]  The health czar.
[01:35:43.231 --> 01:35:44.752]  Get rid of that office.
[01:35:44.752 --> 01:35:46.153]  Nobody should have that kind of power.
[01:35:46.153 --> 01:35:48.154]  That's why you shouldn't have a Department of Education.
[01:35:48.154 --> 01:35:49.795]  Look at what it's done to us.
[01:35:49.795 --> 01:35:51.937]  We've got to fight with it all the time now about Common Core.
[01:35:51.937 --> 01:35:53.197]  That'll never end.
[01:35:53.197 --> 01:35:54.358]  About tranny bathrooms.
[01:35:54.358 --> 01:35:55.419]  About every kind.
[01:35:55.419 --> 01:35:57.760]  And what has happened to the quality of our education?
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:35:59.901]  Same thing's going to happen to the quality of our health care.
[01:35:59.901 --> 01:36:00.882]  The cost of our health care.
[01:36:00.882 --> 01:36:01.883]  The cost of our education.
[01:36:02.827 --> 01:36:05.488]  The Department of Education was created by Jimmy Carter.
[01:36:05.488 --> 01:36:07.168]  Ronald Reagan campaigned on getting rid of it.
[01:36:07.168 --> 01:36:08.369]  Instead, he grew it.
[01:36:08.369 --> 01:36:10.249]  He grew it!
[01:36:10.249 --> 01:36:15.771]  And this is a giant monster that has taken over our society, our education, our budgets.
[01:36:15.771 --> 01:36:17.672]  And the same thing is going to be happening with healthcare?
[01:36:18.814 --> 01:36:24.759]  You're not going to fix this by having a czar come in and take away certain things and turn them over to others.
[01:36:24.759 --> 01:36:26.460]  It's just fundamentally wrong.
[01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:35.728]  And to come in and say, well, I'm going to throw the people who stood on principle under the bus and now I'm going to ally myself with the Democrats, that is moving in the wrong direction, folks.
[01:36:35.728 --> 01:36:36.689]  I'm sorry.
[01:36:36.689 --> 01:36:40.192]  Sorry, but that is moving in the wrong direction.
[01:36:40.192 --> 01:36:44.535]  Before we go back to what's happening with the self-driving cars, I just want to point out to you
[01:36:45.523 --> 01:36:49.526]  That we now have back in stock Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste that's now back in stock.
[01:36:49.526 --> 01:36:52.889]  I pointed out that we have Brain Force Plus at 25% off.
[01:36:52.889 --> 01:36:57.532]  Those are my two favorite products because of both of them I can really immediately feel the difference.
[01:36:57.532 --> 01:36:58.873]  I know certain supplements.
[01:36:58.873 --> 01:37:00.394]  I can look up selenium.
[01:37:00.394 --> 01:37:05.078]  I know that that is something that a lot of studies have shown that helps your health.
[01:37:05.598 --> 01:37:13.608]  It helps to, they have epidemiological studies that show that people take selenium, have lower incidence of certain types of diseases and so forth.
[01:37:13.608 --> 01:37:18.453]  And so you take things like that, those supplements that you know are good for you because you've done the research, but you're not going to feel anything.
[01:37:18.453 --> 01:37:21.817]  But I feel something when I take Brain Force.
[01:37:21.817 --> 01:37:23.779]  I can feel it working on me.
[01:37:24.659 --> 01:37:25.620]  In a good way.
[01:37:25.620 --> 01:37:29.202]  And I feel, in a good way, the fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:37:29.202 --> 01:37:34.345]  It freshens your mouth, the brain force, plus freshens your brain.
[01:37:34.345 --> 01:37:43.510]  And it's very important for you to have a toothpaste that is going to fight bacteria, gum disease, because that leads to heart disease.
[01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:44.151]  It's very serious.
[01:37:45.199 --> 01:37:47.160]  And you want to keep your mind sharp as well.
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:51.781]  So both of those products, now we have the toothpaste back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:37:51.781 --> 01:37:53.542]  We have Brain Force Plus at 25% off.
[01:37:53.542 --> 01:37:58.764]  And of course, the toothpaste has iodine, nano silver, peppermint oil.
[01:37:58.764 --> 01:38:04.226]  That's one of the reasons why it fights bacteria that cause gum disease that then causes heart disease.
[01:38:04.226 --> 01:38:09.687]  Also, we have 30 to 40% off InfoWars select storable food at InfoWarsStar.com.
[01:38:09.687 --> 01:38:10.968]  That is for a limited time.
[01:38:10.968 --> 01:38:13.649]  And again, that is all made in the U.S.
[01:38:13.649 --> 01:38:13.809]  with
[01:38:14.941 --> 01:38:23.344]  Non-GMO ingredients, packaging that has a shelf life of 25 years and is resealable once you open it up for a short period of time.
[01:38:23.344 --> 01:38:26.064]  You can reuse that, reseal it, keep it fresh.
[01:38:26.064 --> 01:38:27.405]  Now is a good time to stock up.
[01:38:27.405 --> 01:38:32.206]  You never know what's going to happen to food prices or just be prepared for any kind of emergency.
[01:38:32.206 --> 01:38:37.228]  It could be a weather emergency, it could be an economic emergency, it could be any kind of emergencies.
[01:38:37.228 --> 01:38:39.849]  Great to have that there in terms of evening out your
[01:38:40.669 --> 01:38:41.429]  Thank you.
[01:38:56.661 --> 01:39:01.765]  Unblocked, uncensored, they won't redirect the links as we see happening with some of these things occasionally.
[01:39:01.765 --> 01:39:06.689]  None of that stuff that is being, none of those games that are being played by Facebook, by Google, be played with that.
[01:39:06.689 --> 01:39:08.271]  We can directly communicate with you.
[01:39:08.271 --> 01:39:09.712]  It's a great way to stay in touch with us.
[01:39:09.712 --> 01:39:10.773]  That is free.
[01:39:10.773 --> 01:39:15.637]  And you will also see specials in every newsletter as we put that out.
[01:39:15.637 --> 01:39:19.700]  So go there and sign up for that free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:39:20.998 --> 01:39:37.351]  Real quickly, this picture that was on the top of Drudge yesterday, the Uber car that was laying on its side, the other car that was damaged, we now know that the Uber vehicle was not responsible for the incident, the Tempe police have said that another car failed to yield for the Uber car.
[01:39:37.351 --> 01:39:39.373]  Okay, well, in spite of that,
[01:39:40.484 --> 01:39:45.608]  Uber is suspending a self-driving car program after that high-impact crash.
[01:39:45.608 --> 01:39:47.609]  Now there's reasons for that, folks.
[01:39:47.609 --> 01:39:52.113]  First of all, they want to tell us that it wasn't their problem.
[01:39:52.113 --> 01:39:57.557]  But I've taught my children how to drive, and one of the things I tell them is don't ever trust on having the right-of-way.
[01:39:57.557 --> 01:40:03.861]  You always want to be wise and measure what other drivers are doing, because you can wind up being dead right.
[01:40:04.764 --> 01:40:09.165]  And so, to say that it wasn't completely responsible, yes, okay, fine.
[01:40:09.165 --> 01:40:12.666]  Maybe it wasn't, but you can always drive defensively.
[01:40:12.666 --> 01:40:33.413]  Now they say that there was another person behind the wheel, and that's good, because we know from Uber's own data that came out on March 16th, Recode got some documents from Uber, and this should be scandalous, like the Snowden documents, or like Vault 7 that was released by WikiLeaks, but nobody has really reported on this much.
[01:40:34.206 --> 01:40:44.693]  There's been a little bit of coverage of it in the technology press, a little bit in the automotive press, but for the most part people have not talked about what's really going on with Uber.
[01:40:44.693 --> 01:40:49.717]  Now if you think that the Uber cars are great, I want you to hear this.
[01:40:49.717 --> 01:40:53.739]  Although Uber cars are steadily increasing the number of miles that are driven autonomously,
[01:40:54.724 --> 01:41:02.226]  The combination of how many times drivers have to take over and how smoothly the car drives is not showing much progress.
[01:41:02.226 --> 01:41:03.666]  They call these things disengagement.
[01:41:03.666 --> 01:41:08.467]  So when the software can't handle it and the driver has to take over, that's called a disengagement.
[01:41:08.467 --> 01:41:11.188]  Now it can be kind of minor or it can be very serious.
[01:41:11.188 --> 01:41:13.829]  This is an article again from Recode.
[01:41:13.829 --> 01:41:15.129]  They got these documents.
[01:41:15.129 --> 01:41:17.130]  They obtained these documents.
[01:41:17.130 --> 01:41:21.391]  These are documents that were circulated throughout Uber's self-driving group.
[01:41:21.391 --> 01:41:22.591]  Now here's the bottom line, folks.
[01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:39.639]  During the week ending March 8th, which is the week before they got these documents, the 43 active cars on the road with Uber as self-driving cars only drove an average of close to 0.8 miles before the human driver had to take over for one reason or another.
[01:41:39.639 --> 01:41:40.620]  You understand?
[01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:44.502]  They can't drive a mile without human intervention.
[01:41:44.502 --> 01:41:50.185]  Now, when you look at something that is very serious, and interestingly, before I move on from that, this is the decline from earlier in the year.
[01:41:50.185 --> 01:41:51.586]  The end of January, that rate was 0.9.
[01:41:54.113 --> 01:41:55.114]  Miles.
[01:41:55.114 --> 01:41:57.958]  That the human would have to take over for the artificial intelligence.
[01:41:57.958 --> 01:41:59.541]  You wanna call it a headless Uber?
[01:41:59.541 --> 01:42:01.263]  It's a mindless Uber.
[01:42:01.263 --> 01:42:02.685]  It's a mindless Uber.
[01:42:02.685 --> 01:42:04.788]  So they can't even drive a mile.
[01:42:05.731 --> 01:42:07.892]  Without having the driver take over.
[01:42:07.892 --> 01:42:25.841]  Now, when you look at something else like a critical intervention, that's defined as the human driver, they call it the safety driver, yeah, okay, the human driver had to take over to avoid harmful events that would result in hitting a pedestrian or causing damage of $5,000 in property that they estimate.
[01:42:25.841 --> 01:42:28.663]  Well, how often did they have to do that?
[01:42:28.663 --> 01:42:31.584]  Remember, they couldn't even drive a mile without the human driver taking over.
[01:42:31.584 --> 01:42:33.425]  Well, they were saying that it was between 100 and 200 miles.
[01:42:35.509 --> 01:42:42.594]  That they would have a catastrophic accident, like $5,000 in damage or hitting a, killing a pedestrian.
[01:42:42.594 --> 01:42:43.915]  Is that acceptable?
[01:42:43.915 --> 01:42:46.316]  Is that better than a drunk driver?
[01:42:46.316 --> 01:42:48.097]  I don't think so!
[01:42:48.097 --> 01:42:55.742]  And yet you've got Wired Magazine coming out and saying, well this is a reminder of why we can't have human drivers, because the human driver was at fault in Tempe, Arizona.
[01:42:55.742 --> 01:42:59.085]  They will always be shills for this surveillance technology.
[01:42:59.085 --> 01:43:00.125]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:43:00.125 --> 01:43:01.086]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:43:01.326 --> 01:43:06.249]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[01:43:06.249 --> 01:43:09.772]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[01:43:09.772 --> 01:43:15.595]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[01:43:15.595 --> 01:43:24.701]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[01:43:24.701 --> 01:43:29.785]  Plus, you can take it with you to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[01:43:30.245 --> 01:43:37.267]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid literally anywhere in the world.
[01:43:37.267 --> 01:43:42.108]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[01:43:42.108 --> 01:43:45.388]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[01:43:45.388 --> 01:43:47.489]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[01:43:47.489 --> 01:43:53.210]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[01:43:53.210 --> 01:43:55.631]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[01:43:55.631 --> 01:43:57.331]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[01:43:58.942 --> 01:44:00.824]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:44:00.824 --> 01:44:02.845]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:44:02.845 --> 01:44:05.647]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:44:05.647 --> 01:44:11.832]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:44:11.832 --> 01:44:18.037]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems.
[01:44:18.317 --> 01:44:20.998]  ...have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:44:20.998 --> 01:44:28.542]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children, to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:44:28.542 --> 01:44:36.566]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:44:36.566 --> 01:44:37.527]  The general public doesn't.
[01:44:38.750 --> 01:44:42.112]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:44:42.112 --> 01:44:46.254]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:44:46.254 --> 01:44:52.957]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:44:52.957 --> 01:44:57.059]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:30.501]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[01:46:30.501 --> 01:46:31.761]  That's really incredible.
[01:46:31.761 --> 01:46:34.822]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[01:46:34.822 --> 01:46:36.182]  Like, I haven't felt asleep.
[01:46:36.182 --> 01:46:37.843]  My morning was fantastic.
[01:46:37.843 --> 01:46:38.983]  And I love these guys.
[01:46:38.983 --> 01:46:41.244]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[01:46:41.244 --> 01:46:48.085]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[01:46:48.085 --> 01:46:49.145]  You will love it.
[01:46:49.145 --> 01:46:49.646]  I'm telling you.
[01:46:49.646 --> 01:46:50.946]  I've never bought a bad product.
[01:46:51.266 --> 01:46:55.709]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[01:46:55.709 --> 01:46:56.569]  It's a win-win.
[01:46:56.569 --> 01:47:03.614]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:47:03.614 --> 01:47:06.216]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:14.332 --> 01:47:16.195]  We are on the march.
[01:47:16.195 --> 01:47:19.361]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:47:19.361 --> 01:47:23.087]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:27.349 --> 01:47:28.710]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:28.710 --> 01:47:29.991]  I'm David Knight.
[01:47:29.991 --> 01:47:37.697]  I want to close out this show with some excerpts of an interview that Alex Jones had with one of the heroes of Benghazi, one of the survivors.
[01:47:37.697 --> 01:47:41.520]  Of course, if you've seen the movie 13 Hours, you know about this gentleman.
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:42.841]  But it's a very good interview.
[01:47:42.841 --> 01:47:48.765]  I wanted you to hear the beginning of this, and of course, for the full interview, you'll find on Alex Jones' YouTube channel.
[01:47:48.765 --> 01:47:52.308]  But I wanted to get this to our Sunday audience, because it's a bit different audience.
[01:47:52.308 --> 01:47:56.731]  So without any further delay, here's excerpts from Alex Jones' interview with the Benghazi hero.
[01:47:58.053 --> 01:48:00.774]  I'll take a couple buddies and we'll go grab them and bring them into you.
[01:48:00.774 --> 01:48:02.135]  President Trump, just give us a word.
[01:48:02.135 --> 01:48:03.096]  But it needs to happen.
[01:48:03.096 --> 01:48:05.277]  It does need to happen and I am in total agreement with you.
[01:48:05.277 --> 01:48:08.018]  You gotta cut the head off of a snake and watch it die.
[01:48:08.018 --> 01:48:11.159]  And I think right now, that's the head right there is George Soros.
[01:48:11.159 --> 01:48:16.202]  It'd be really ridiculous at this point for them to start, there's some civil war going on.
[01:48:16.202 --> 01:48:21.344]  You've got guys like myself, you've got plenty of contractors out there that are back home now.
[01:48:21.344 --> 01:48:26.967]  Plenty of people like myself that are patriots that aren't gonna stand aside and let some coup
[01:48:27.447 --> 01:48:29.489]  If you want to call it that, take over.
[01:48:29.489 --> 01:48:34.093]  So I see it as a lot of BS, a lot of just tough talk at this point in time.
[01:48:34.093 --> 01:48:36.576]  But if it comes to this, it's not going to be tough talk.
[01:48:36.576 --> 01:48:41.300]  Believe me, people like myself will stand up and we'll be coming right back at you.
[01:48:41.300 --> 01:48:43.242]  So I just warn them, don't.
[01:48:43.242 --> 01:48:50.669]  Just stop that BS and put a cork in it right now before it really ends up getting to something that they really don't want to get into.
[01:49:00.165 --> 01:49:01.125]  There's so much to talk about.
[01:49:01.125 --> 01:49:03.946]  The point is, there's a lot of special hunters who think this country belongs to them.
[01:49:03.946 --> 01:49:04.746]  They've overrun it.
[01:49:04.746 --> 01:49:06.847]  They've taken control of it.
[01:49:06.847 --> 01:49:11.689]  But the good news is, the sleeping giant that is America, of every race, color, and creed, we're all Americans.
[01:49:11.689 --> 01:49:12.689]  We bleed red blood.
[01:49:12.689 --> 01:49:14.349]  We're one race on this planet.
[01:49:14.349 --> 01:49:18.571]  We're waking up to it, and it's a beautiful thing.
[01:49:18.571 --> 01:49:22.112]  Michael Moore came out again yesterday and said we need a civil emergency and to overthrow
[01:49:23.254 --> 01:49:24.976]  President Trump, you see it all over the news.
[01:49:24.976 --> 01:49:27.200]  Killing, have martial law, Rosie O'Donnell.
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:34.850]  You have the former deputy head of the Defense Department in the news going to the Pentagon trying to shop the idea of the military overthrowing the president.
[01:49:34.850 --> 01:49:38.455]  That's so illegal, folks, that it makes my head spin.
[01:49:39.156 --> 01:49:40.376]  And it's a bunch of foreign interests.
[01:49:40.376 --> 01:49:43.057]  The Communist Chinese coming in to help censor Facebook.
[01:49:43.057 --> 01:49:44.337]  You cannot make this up.
[01:49:44.337 --> 01:49:46.778]  So I just talked to some military guys I know.
[01:49:46.778 --> 01:49:52.759]  We happen to know Chris Tonto, of course, one of the big heroes and survivors of what happened in Benghazi.
[01:49:52.759 --> 01:49:56.020]  And of course, lionized properly so in the new film, 13 Hours.
[01:49:56.020 --> 01:49:58.201]  It's a big hit and so amazing.
[01:49:58.201 --> 01:49:59.541]  To ask, what do you think we should do?
[01:49:59.541 --> 01:50:06.743]  Well, say we support the president and talk about if they're calling for military operations against the president, we're not calling for anything offensive.
[01:50:07.623 --> 01:50:14.930]  We should start a discussion about the left thinking and Soros doubling the amount of money to these groups to kill cops and burn down cities.
[01:50:14.930 --> 01:50:15.851]  They're planning something.
[01:50:15.851 --> 01:50:18.053]  So Chris, we're going to skip this break so you have more time.
[01:50:18.053 --> 01:50:21.156]  Thank you for joining us and coming on and obviously everything you've done.
[01:50:21.156 --> 01:50:23.478]  Chris, TontoPiranto.com.
[01:50:23.478 --> 01:50:25.661]  I've kind of set the table the last four minutes.
[01:50:25.661 --> 01:50:27.703]  Where are we going with this?
[01:50:28.543 --> 01:50:33.888]  I honestly, I think right now it's just a lot of lib talk.
[01:50:33.888 --> 01:50:38.711]  It'd be really ridiculous at this point for them to try to start some civil war going on.
[01:50:38.711 --> 01:50:48.059]  I mean, you've got guys like myself, you've got plenty of contractors out there that are back home now, plenty of people like myself that are patriots that aren't going to stand aside.
[01:50:48.599 --> 01:50:50.521]  I don't think it's realistic.
[01:50:50.521 --> 01:50:54.443]  I think again, it's a lot of threats and the libs do that.
[01:50:54.443 --> 01:50:57.866]  They are a lot of talk, but when action comes and it comes actually picking up a gun and doing something,
[01:51:12.736 --> 01:51:19.619]  I think if they were more inclined to protect this country, you'd probably see more of them joining the military or joining the law enforcement.
[01:51:19.619 --> 01:51:24.221]  So I see it as a lot of BS, a lot of just tough talk at this point in time.
[01:51:24.221 --> 01:51:26.702]  But if it comes to this, it's not going to be tough talk.
[01:51:26.702 --> 01:51:31.424]  Believe me, people like myself will stand up and we'll be coming right back at you.
[01:51:31.424 --> 01:51:33.065]  So I just warn them, don't.
[01:51:33.065 --> 01:51:40.828]  Just stop that BS and put a cork in it right now before it really ends up getting to something that they really don't want to get into.
[01:51:41.701 --> 01:51:47.064]  Well, Chris, that's exactly why, as this rhetoric heated up, I wanted to get you on, because you're somebody with just a few other guys.
[01:51:47.064 --> 01:51:48.866]  Of course, some of them died, unfortunately.
[01:51:48.866 --> 01:51:56.210]  Took on hundreds and hundreds of people in two different, you know, major, you know, battle scenes under 13 hours of admitted stand-down.
[01:51:56.210 --> 01:51:58.812]  You just have the physical courage and one of the most, you know, amazing...
[01:51:59.472 --> 01:52:10.083]  Alamo's where some people actually made it out or a 300 where a few people actually made it so it's beyond that you actually survived at a 300 type you know scenario but where it was just six against 300 or 500 but looking at this
[01:52:13.277 --> 01:52:39.706]  That's why I wanted to get you to talk about this as an expert on it, because they seem confident, and I agree it's a lot of talk, but they're really trying to organize it, and I understand Trump's resistance to standing up to this because it'll make him look like a fascist, but when they're openly calling for his death everywhere, and my death and everybody else, and it's just horrible, at a certain point it becomes dereliction of duty if somebody doesn't get indicted, if somebody doesn't get in trouble, you know, when Bow Wow
[01:52:40.206 --> 01:52:44.130]  You know, says, I want to kidnap and rape and enslave the First Lady.
[01:52:44.130 --> 01:52:50.858]  Or when his uncle comes out, Snoop Dogg, and says, I want to kill Trump, puts a music video out.
[01:52:50.858 --> 01:52:52.520]  We know he's a coward, won't do it.
[01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:55.343]  But he's trying to activate other mentally ill people.
[01:52:55.343 --> 01:52:56.364]  So that's why I'm so concerned.
[01:52:56.624 --> 01:52:59.207]  That's true, and you have a good point there.
[01:52:59.207 --> 01:53:05.074]  In the past, if you did that, then the Secret Service would be knocking at your door and possibly you'd be going to prison.
[01:53:05.074 --> 01:53:06.135]  I think that needs to happen.
[01:53:06.135 --> 01:53:07.076]  I think it needs to return.
[01:53:07.076 --> 01:53:09.539]  There does need to be an example set.
[01:53:09.539 --> 01:53:15.086]  Whether it be Snoop Dogg or somebody else out there where you're going to say you're going to kill the President, that's a threat.
[01:53:15.086 --> 01:53:16.888]  That is a terroristic threat at this point.
[01:53:17.688 --> 01:53:23.513]  And the Secret Service, FBI, local law enforcement, somebody needs to be knocking on the doors and pulling these guys in handcuffs.
[01:53:23.513 --> 01:53:32.920]  And honestly, if it is a star, and I hate to use the word Hollywood star, but if that's what you want to call yourselves, a star, you know, TMZ needs to be there, too, to make an example out of you.
[01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:34.081]  An example needs to be made.
[01:53:34.081 --> 01:53:37.103]  And I don't have a problem if Trump decided to do that.
[01:53:37.103 --> 01:53:38.204]  He shouldn't be called a fascist.
[01:53:39.765 --> 01:53:41.567]  You don't threaten to kill the President of the United States.
[01:53:41.567 --> 01:53:42.187]  You don't do that.
[01:53:42.187 --> 01:53:43.549]  In the past, you've never done it.
[01:53:43.549 --> 01:53:57.221]  If you do do it, there are repercussions to it, and I think he does at this point in time, or somebody within the DOJ needs to take this upon themselves and go ahead and do the right thing and arrest somebody.
[01:53:57.221 --> 01:53:59.983]  Make an example out of somebody and make it a public example.
[01:54:01.124 --> 01:54:04.026]  You know, we'll see what happens, but you can't keep letting it go.
[01:54:04.026 --> 01:54:05.107]  You're correct.
[01:54:05.107 --> 01:54:06.929]  You've got to lance that blister eventually.
[01:54:06.929 --> 01:54:08.350]  If not, it's going to get infected.
[01:54:08.350 --> 01:54:09.030]  You've got to do it.
[01:54:09.030 --> 01:54:11.372]  And if you don't, it's just going to get worse and worse and worse.
[01:54:11.372 --> 01:54:12.833]  So I do agree.
[01:54:12.833 --> 01:54:14.815]  I do agree at this point with the threats to the president.
[01:54:14.815 --> 01:54:19.919]  But again, do I think that they're going to come out and actually start an all-out war, a civil war in the United States of America?
[01:54:19.919 --> 01:54:23.442]  They'd be well-earned to not do that.
[01:54:25.223 --> 01:54:28.165]  I mean, I totally agree with what you're saying about the battle space.
[01:54:28.165 --> 01:54:28.906]  We have the right.
[01:54:28.906 --> 01:54:29.646]  We're Americans.
[01:54:29.646 --> 01:54:32.888]  99% of the patriots are, you know, obviously with the president.
[01:54:32.888 --> 01:54:36.651]  He's executing like no president ever seen on his promises.
[01:54:36.651 --> 01:54:37.712]  It's almost unbelievable.
[01:54:37.712 --> 01:54:38.692]  It's so good.
[01:54:38.692 --> 01:54:41.715]  And so it'd be one thing if he was like selling us out to foreign powers or something.
[01:54:41.715 --> 01:54:43.276]  And that brings us to the next point.
[01:54:43.276 --> 01:54:47.258]  What do you make of now Nunes coming out and saying, no, they were surveilling him basically illegally.
[01:54:47.258 --> 01:54:50.861]  The surveillance was legal because it was overseas, but they were using it domestically
[01:54:51.141 --> 01:55:02.168]  The Democratic Party during the transition, and then this claim that he's a Russian agent securing our borders, building up our military, turning our coal back on that actually decimates the Russian gas exports.
[01:55:02.168 --> 01:55:04.830]  I mean, really, if you look at what Trump's doing, he's dominating.
[01:55:04.830 --> 01:55:08.353]  He's doing, I love how you said it, he's doing exactly what he said.
[01:55:08.353 --> 01:55:14.937]  There's no president, I think, that's come in the last, I know in the last eight years for sure, but the last, you know, 12, 16 years.
[01:55:14.937 --> 01:55:18.079]  Reagan was great, but he didn't deliver like, it took him three years to deliver a recovery.
[01:55:18.079 --> 01:55:19.120]  Trump's done it in 50 days.
[01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:22.163]  Yes, it's been outstanding, and I have respect for that.
[01:55:22.163 --> 01:55:27.488]  Whether I agree with the policies or not, he's doing what he said he was going to do, and that's fantastic.
[01:55:27.488 --> 01:55:31.052]  As far as Nunez, I know Congressman Nunez.
[01:55:31.052 --> 01:55:32.713]  Congressman Nunez is actually a friend.
[01:55:32.713 --> 01:55:35.416]  Congressman Nunez has always said what he meant.
[01:55:35.416 --> 01:55:38.980]  He's always been honest with everything that he's had to do with myself and in my situation.
[01:55:38.980 --> 01:55:41.062]  He just comes off as very, a lot of courage, very honorable.
[01:55:41.062 --> 01:55:43.224]  He's the only guy to admit the truth when they all know the truth.
[01:55:44.164 --> 01:55:48.505]  And so if he's saying it, I'll give it 99.9% that that thing is going on.
[01:55:48.505 --> 01:55:55.006]  And as far as them doing it legally and then doing an elite, what it is, they're doing something illegally, but pulling illegal things off of it.
[01:55:55.006 --> 01:55:56.607]  That's typical CIA at the moment.
[01:55:56.607 --> 01:55:58.007]  Pompeo needs to clean house there.
[01:55:58.007 --> 01:55:59.887]  They need to come in and see what was actually going on.
[01:55:59.887 --> 01:56:08.409]  There needs to be heads to roll at the agency because what they were doing, they were getting information about Trump and it was, it was, in my opinion,
[01:56:08.849 --> 01:56:09.409]  That's illegal.
[01:56:09.409 --> 01:56:10.090]  You don't do that.
[01:56:10.090 --> 01:56:17.274]  Whether it's with a, you're doing an illegal act, a legal action, going to foreign powers, but you're masking an illegal action by doing that.
[01:56:17.274 --> 01:56:18.835]  Well, that's, that's illegal, isn't it?
[01:56:18.835 --> 01:56:19.496]  Isn't it?
[01:56:19.496 --> 01:56:21.377]  Does it, what, it's still illegal.
[01:56:21.377 --> 01:56:35.886]  So, my opinion is that, again, Pompeo needs to get in there and take care of the agency and find out where, what was going on and see if, and see if there is actual basis to, to get somebody arrested, get some charges against somebody.
[01:56:36.286 --> 01:56:36.666]  I don't know.
[01:56:53.340 --> 01:56:53.680]  Exactly.
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:58.044]  If that says anything about how honest this man is and his integrity.
[01:56:58.044 --> 01:57:00.185]  So I leave it in Congressman Nunes' hands.
[01:57:00.185 --> 01:57:03.688]  He's a subject matter expert when it comes to this and I think he can continue to pursue it.
[01:57:03.688 --> 01:57:11.694]  And he will come to a good resolution if people within the Trump administration's sessions and others will back him.
[01:57:11.694 --> 01:57:13.515]  He has a good Attorney General that can help him out.
[01:57:13.515 --> 01:57:17.578]  Where in our case, we didn't have a good Attorney General twice.
[01:57:17.578 --> 01:57:20.741]  We had Eric Holder and then Loretta Lynch of course weren't going to back us at all.
[01:57:21.341 --> 01:57:29.064]  So um, but I think I think he has the opportunity here to to come in and again set examples So it doesn't happen again.
[01:57:29.064 --> 01:57:30.744]  Chris Paranto known as Tonto.
