[00:00.000 --> 00:14.640]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.640 --> 00:39.040]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones it is Wednesday June 4th 2014 I
[00:39.040 --> 00:44.040]  am your host Alex Jones and I want to do something a little bit different in this first hour
[00:44.040 --> 00:52.360]  the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre when the people stood up the anti
[00:52.360 --> 00:57.720]  communist demonstrators simply wanting to demonstrate that the government was corrupt
[00:57.720 --> 01:04.320]  and tyrannical and was not allowing them to vote all they could do was watch the central party
[01:04.320 --> 01:10.560]  committee appoint people to different positions and the answer was to send in army tanks to run
[01:10.560 --> 01:14.960]  over people and shoot them we have some of the raw footage of Tiananmen Square that they never
[01:14.960 --> 01:20.520]  really show on US media or in Chinese news for that matter of the tanks running over people of
[01:20.520 --> 01:26.920]  the piles of dead body you name it in my film in-game blueprint for global enslavement detailing
[01:26.920 --> 01:31.360]  that the globalists that run our country love communist China and have said that communist China
[01:31.360 --> 01:37.440]  is the model of the world civilization they want to build so I want to talk about the first amendment
[01:37.440 --> 01:44.600]  today but also look at the state of the establishment the state of the Obama administration this
[01:44.600 --> 01:49.640]  Bo Bergdahl situation really blowing up in their face why would they do something like this when
[01:49.640 --> 01:55.240]  it would blow up in their face what's the larger sigh up here or is it complete incompetence let me
[01:55.240 --> 01:58.240]  tell you they're not incompetent when it comes to shutting down our power plants they're not
[01:58.240 --> 02:02.440]  incompetent when it comes to federalizing our schools they're not incompetent when it comes to
[02:02.440 --> 02:08.800]  turning different countries over to al-Qaeda so what's the larger issue there it is the first
[02:08.800 --> 02:14.680]  amendment so here in the United States it's free speech worldwide I want to celebrate it today in
[02:14.680 --> 02:20.320]  the first second and third hour we do have some guests coming up taking calls the entire three
[02:20.320 --> 02:24.000]  hours even though we have some guests coming up we'll try to interspersed phone calls when
[02:24.000 --> 02:30.440]  David Knight is riding shotgun to talk about the state of the press and to talk about the state of
[02:30.440 --> 02:35.120]  the people we the people should become the press that's why it's in the first amendment the right
[02:35.120 --> 02:38.640]  of religion the right of free speech the right of the press the right to assemble the right to
[02:38.640 --> 02:44.360]  petition we exercise those muscles or we lose them someone have a larger discussion about the
[02:44.360 --> 02:48.640]  press the role the press the role the people and David Knight was talking yesterday when he was
[02:48.640 --> 02:55.200]  hosting a show after I left I was listening to him on the free iPhone app as I watch my children
[02:55.200 --> 03:02.080]  play in the pool here at the Texas surf side and here at the Texas beach and he said you know we
[03:02.080 --> 03:09.320]  the real media versus the fake media and we're always trying to come up with a term mainstream
[03:09.320 --> 03:15.800]  media dinosaur media is my term press to media is Gerald Salentes term sewer stream media Decepticon
[03:15.800 --> 03:32.920]  media the enemy media there's a lot of different terms for it but I think the best term is the
[03:32.920 --> 03:36.920]  fake media it's beyond state run media because the average person doesn't really know what
[03:36.920 --> 03:41.560]  state run media is the average dumb down person out there doesn't know that every movie every
[03:41.560 --> 03:47.520]  major TV show has a message in it most of it global is financed they're not aware of that
[03:47.520 --> 03:58.120]  so we're going to be expanding on that today and and really calling for everyone to speak out
[03:58.120 --> 04:03.920]  against the fake media and then once you use the term fake media you can expand into state run
[04:03.920 --> 04:08.400]  media for the general public that isn't awake yet sure we got 20% of the public public pretty
[04:08.400 --> 04:13.960]  much awake another 30% that are somewhat awake but half the public doesn't even know what planet
[04:13.960 --> 04:20.560]  they're on and are literally bots programmed by mainstream fake media and and again I just
[04:20.560 --> 04:26.960]  called a mainstream media I hope today is the day that we stop calling it mainstream media and we
[04:26.960 --> 04:34.480]  start calling it fake state run media or the globalist collaborator occupied media it's all
[04:34.480 --> 04:39.920]  coming up today jam packed transmission a bunch of breaking news I haven't gotten to yet up on

[08:24.880 --> 08:30.400]  jones riding shotgun with us is david night today and of course i do things a little bit
[08:30.400 --> 08:35.040]  differently than any other radio talk shows out there even when i take a few weeks of vacation
[08:35.040 --> 08:43.040]  off a year i like to end up doing an hour or two or three like i did on monday i did two hours
[08:43.040 --> 08:48.720]  or two hours and 20 minutes of my own three hour broadcast and i file video reports from the road
[08:48.720 --> 08:55.360]  and basically work from the road so i'll be here during the first hour today then david night will
[08:55.360 --> 09:01.200]  be hosting the second and third hour daniel estalon who did get bill deberg's agenda has an inside
[09:01.200 --> 09:05.760]  source uh he's proven it over and over again i have to know who one of his sources is not the other
[09:06.640 --> 09:11.760]  and uh he's we're going to recap their real agenda for the world because we're focusing on the real
[09:12.480 --> 09:16.720]  shadow masters so they're not the shadows anymore and then any other intel he got
[09:16.720 --> 09:20.880]  the week after bill deberg anything he learned during bill deberg but that's only the first
[09:20.880 --> 09:26.960]  half of estalon the second half of estalon we're going to have open phones in the spirit of free
[09:26.960 --> 09:31.920]  speech and the people being the press and the people asking the questions you can ask daniel
[09:32.640 --> 09:37.840]  estalon uh or david night any questions you have in the last 30 minutes of the third hour
[09:37.840 --> 09:43.200]  and in that spirit today the 25th anniversary of the people of china the most populous nation
[09:43.200 --> 09:50.560]  25 years ago today trying to simply demonstrate peacefully in the tenement square or the equivalent
[09:50.560 --> 09:59.120]  of uh you know the lincoln memorial like martin luther king did and it took him about half a day
[09:59.120 --> 10:04.480]  to finally find generals from a province 300 miles away to come in with army tanks with a group
[10:04.480 --> 10:09.600]  that spoke even a different dialect of chinese they've got more than 25 major dialects uh it'd
[10:09.600 --> 10:16.000]  be like taking folks out of california to come in and kill texans or sending texans to vermont to
[10:16.000 --> 10:22.640]  kill folks in vermont they brought in the armor and we always see that famous photo of tank man a
[10:22.640 --> 10:27.680]  video still that had to be smuggled out of the country later tank man blocking a tank but if you
[10:27.680 --> 10:33.760]  go and get the full photo of tank man it shows more than 20 tanks backed up by one person
[10:33.760 --> 10:39.600]  and no one knows what happened to tank man just like no one knows what happened to the unknown
[10:39.600 --> 10:44.880]  soldier there's a photo we should take a photo of it right now so we can show it on air it's it's
[10:44.880 --> 10:52.560]  back in the back hallway uh in between the shipping department and the warehouse and and the uh
[10:52.560 --> 10:57.280]  reporter area there's a photo that my parents got when they were in germany a few years ago
[10:57.280 --> 11:01.840]  visiting family that lives over there who's in the military long story short they were over there
[11:01.840 --> 11:07.920]  and it's a famous photo of when they set up checkpoint charlie uh and weren't letting east
[11:07.920 --> 11:12.240]  germans out of the country and they were just machine gun men women and children the communist
[11:12.240 --> 11:18.160]  would uh the communist germans the nazis just handed the baton off right into soviet tyranny
[11:18.160 --> 11:25.520]  so it worked perfectly uh like a horse and carriage of a east german soldier who is the
[11:25.520 --> 11:30.400]  three-year-old boy the toddler gets tied up in the bar bar and then that german soldier
[11:30.400 --> 11:35.120]  hands him across to his parents and then he was disappeared and tortured and were told killed
[11:35.120 --> 11:39.200]  never to be heard from again because he was an image of freedom and an image of humanity
[11:40.480 --> 11:45.200]  and it's going to be that humanity that stops the globalists that's why they want to go to robots
[11:45.200 --> 11:51.440]  drones automated systems smart grids that spy on us and control us because the globalists see us as
[11:51.440 --> 11:57.680]  well as a wild beast seven billion 350 million of us that they must control they must dumb down
[11:57.680 --> 12:09.760]  and this broadcast is incontrovertibly opposed at a physical dna level in a spiritual level against
[12:09.760 --> 12:16.320]  all forms of tyranny over the minds of humanity uh i know that a free open society produces the
[12:16.320 --> 12:22.320]  best country the best nation the best system and every philosopher and historian of any worth uh
[12:22.320 --> 12:29.520]  uh says that's the case as well so we know authoritarianism is not good for even the elite
[12:29.520 --> 12:33.680]  we need an elite based on the fact that they're smarter they're more intelligent they're harder
[12:33.680 --> 12:37.680]  working they're better looking they create better literature they're better authors they're better
[12:37.680 --> 12:43.200]  lecturers they're better scientists and that will be an elite of every race color creed and uh
[12:43.200 --> 12:49.760]  religion and and true diversity a nominal elite of centralized bankers who are using
[12:49.760 --> 12:54.640]  five thousand year old banking manipulation systems of where the money changes the gold
[12:55.600 --> 13:02.320]  banks the the pawn shops of ancient Babylon and Egypt and then right through Greece Rome
[13:03.280 --> 13:09.280]  to the goldsmiths and money changers of 500 years ago in Germany the Rothschilds 400 years ago
[13:09.280 --> 13:15.520]  the red shields where they would have 100 pieces of gold but loan out credit for 10 000 pieces of
[13:15.520 --> 13:22.800]  gold on pieces of paper or tally sticks or their seal on a letter that's why those ink seals were
[13:22.800 --> 13:30.720]  so important or or the the seals with the wax you can be executed if you falsified seals or
[13:30.720 --> 13:36.000]  falsified signatures you ever see lord montan's signature it's like this incredibly complex
[13:36.000 --> 13:40.000]  thing that would take you know you 10 years to learn how to do it's this big perfect design
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.640]  that's because your mark couldn't be copied and you wouldn't want someone to be able to copy it
[13:44.640 --> 13:50.400]  that's where all this comes from and we need to get back to things being based on ideas and
[13:50.400 --> 14:00.560]  based on quality in a free market of of competition true democracy of the free market versus a
[14:00.560 --> 14:05.600]  democracy of tyranny where they domesticate the general public train them to enslave the other
[14:05.600 --> 14:12.400]  49 percent that's why we're a republic or a limited democracy where it doesn't matter if the mass
[14:12.400 --> 14:19.760]  wants to enslave one group everyone has unalienable inalienable rights that cannot be changed cannot
[14:19.760 --> 14:24.560]  be manipulated even if the mass of people want to say black people aren't humans well sorry you
[14:24.560 --> 14:30.400]  can't do that anymore because the minority of white christians said it was wrong 60 years after the
[14:30.400 --> 14:35.440]  abolition movement started in england and the united states slavery was outlawed in almost the entire
[14:35.440 --> 14:40.000]  western world still ongoing in africa in the middle east today but no one wants to talk about that
[14:40.000 --> 14:46.160]  because it doesn't fit into the whole demonization of the west program now continuing ladies and
[14:46.160 --> 14:50.960]  gentlemen in that spirit of free speech and the first amendment i want to open the phones up
[14:50.960 --> 14:57.680]  throughout the full three hours today except for the 30 minutes when estalon is on by himself with
[14:57.680 --> 15:03.920]  with night and just try to take about 20 calls an hour on any subjects you want to discuss but
[15:03.920 --> 15:10.720]  i would like to hear from you if you would like to comment on it but it is open phones
[15:10.720 --> 15:14.720]  first time long time agree disagree i would like to hear from you out there
[15:16.320 --> 15:20.880]  on the nature of what the first amendment really means congress shall make no law respecting
[15:20.880 --> 15:25.680]  establishment of religion or bring the free exercise thereof or the press or the people's
[15:25.680 --> 15:30.000]  right to peaceably assemble and petition the government for redress of grievances think i
[15:30.000 --> 15:34.640]  got it all right there the point is going from memory it's all right there it doesn't give us
[15:34.640 --> 15:40.400]  those rights it points out what was already there and so you use it or you lose it and i know we
[15:40.400 --> 15:47.280]  all know that like muscles you don't use them you lose them the atrophy but i'll tell you i
[15:47.280 --> 15:52.240]  didn't work out for more than 15 years and gained about 100 pounds it's taken me four five years of
[15:52.240 --> 15:56.320]  working out changing my diet and taking supplements i've lost more than half of it and i intend to
[15:56.320 --> 16:01.600]  lose the rest and that's an incredible attribute of the body i'm older and i shouldn't be able to
[16:03.120 --> 16:08.000]  reverse all i did when i was young but i am because that's how the body's designed if you don't
[16:08.000 --> 16:14.160]  turn it around too late and it's the same thing for a country or a nation we can turn ourselves
[16:14.160 --> 16:20.160]  around if we believe we can and rediscover the common sense narrative of freedom that's hiding
[16:20.160 --> 16:25.360]  in plain view and the system knows a great time of change is coming and that we're at the bottom
[16:25.360 --> 16:32.160]  of a major decadence cycle right now the system is aware of that so it's moving in to try to
[16:32.160 --> 16:36.320]  suppress the people and admitting that on every front they wanted to build their global tyranny
[16:36.320 --> 16:41.840]  the architecture of oppression quietly behind the scenes but like a giant ship in a shipyard
[16:43.120 --> 16:48.080]  when they finally remove the curtain and open the big gates and cut the blocks and the ship
[16:48.080 --> 16:54.000]  goes into the water it's revealing itself and the ship has been launched the dreadnaught tyranny is
[16:54.000 --> 17:01.200]  upon us but it hid itself because it knows the power of the people cynicism not believing in
[17:01.200 --> 17:06.160]  liberty being lazy not caring about others thinking you get ahead by only caring about yourself
[17:06.160 --> 17:12.880]  is what brings down civilizations but also caring about civilization but being manipulated
[17:12.880 --> 17:17.360]  into serving evil is what brings it down even faster so it's not enough to care and be involved
[17:17.360 --> 17:23.280]  you've got to be researched and you've got to be involved in the right areas for the right causes
[17:23.280 --> 17:29.280]  and the cause we're promoting is classic americana classic freedom classic renaissance classic
[17:29.280 --> 17:36.160]  enlightenment classic victory classic success classic civility classic honor classic truth

[17:55.680 --> 18:00.320]  contestant benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson and george washington talked about that

[25:02.720 --> 25:09.520]  burgdoll release that just is an absolute fraud on every front why would obama do this
[25:09.520 --> 25:13.520]  they know how to put out propaganda stunts there is something going on behind this
[25:14.160 --> 25:17.920]  and i haven't figured out what it is yet but rhodo know that he was going to defect
[25:17.920 --> 25:24.160]  to uh the economy network uh all the rest of it all these people dying trying to get him

[25:33.840 --> 25:38.080]  planet dot com and info wars dot com on that front uh let's go to george and connecticut
[25:38.080 --> 25:44.400]  you're on the air thank you for coming in today hi alex i'm wondering if we couldn't have a story
[25:44.400 --> 25:51.280]  maybe for the uh the europeans uh in particular rebranding bill de burg as the as the the rise
[25:51.280 --> 25:57.120]  of the nazis again because europeans are very sensitive to this issue and if people realize
[25:57.120 --> 26:02.960]  that the same people that are that have promoted the bill de burg movement are also the same people
[26:02.960 --> 26:07.760]  who promoted hitler and various other things and and they start to look into this more deeply
[26:07.760 --> 26:13.200]  and they wouldn't want these people on their soil would become like like uh having a plague upon
[26:13.200 --> 26:18.880]  your soil and i think that's an important issue because uh i don't think most europeans see that
[26:18.880 --> 26:24.160]  yet some of them do but not as a as a large body incredible point appreciate your call
[26:24.160 --> 26:28.800]  just let me briefly comment on that go to more calls the nazi thing's been way overplayed that
[26:28.800 --> 26:33.440]  card is just you know don't like obama carrier nazi don't turn your guns in your nazi don't
[26:33.440 --> 26:38.080]  want the borders totally open you're a nazi but then if you're george soros a real nazi
[26:38.080 --> 26:44.160]  collaborator or sorts of negative city admired nazis to rolling stone magazine and reportedly
[26:44.160 --> 26:52.800]  wears ss uniforms at home i mean i'm not kidding that's all okay so it's purely political when msnbc
[26:52.800 --> 26:58.080]  says i'm deeply racist and then shows no proof it just shows how they're totally fake state run
[26:58.080 --> 27:03.200]  anti-american anti-freedom media bill de burg was founded mainly by a bunch of former nazis
[27:03.200 --> 27:08.880]  with a bunch of european robber barons and british and u.s robber barons on record in 1954
[27:10.160 --> 27:16.480]  and they brag they found the euro and the rest of it and it's true that it's not just the nazis
[27:16.480 --> 27:23.840]  there's always authoritarian interest who want authoritarianism to be able to take over a society
[27:23.840 --> 27:33.440]  joseph mingle's family was royal uh the royal family got behind hitler uh in in germany because
[27:33.440 --> 27:37.760]  they lost the austrian and german empire and it's not that the germans were the bad guys
[27:37.760 --> 27:42.480]  the globalists were manipulating both sides and that's been declassified the british intelligence
[27:42.480 --> 27:48.720]  was actually helping fund a bunch of radical groups the communist and the nazis early on
[27:48.720 --> 27:54.960]  in the 20s and 30s because they want to destabilize things just like they give arms to Assad and al-qaeda
[27:54.960 --> 28:03.120]  now to destabilize syria so it's the same story over and over again and the e u project was a
[28:03.120 --> 28:09.040]  hitler nazi project that's even in the bbc and it was done by stealth and they couldn't win with tanks
[28:09.040 --> 28:13.520]  so they won with an economic takeover but it's beyond the nazis it's financial interests that
[28:13.520 --> 28:18.640]  want authoritarianism and now look we're going under the asian trade unions and the rest of it
[28:18.640 --> 28:22.080]  all of our rights are being taken under it internet rights you name it there's not even
[28:22.080 --> 28:25.520]  discussion in the media there's like there's not discussion of bilderberg in the control corporate
[28:25.520 --> 28:32.320]  press because people don't know there's a pacific trade deal being done right now with 30 points
[28:32.320 --> 28:37.600]  only two of them have been leaked that are just freedom ending we got the copenhagen carbon
[28:37.600 --> 28:41.760]  tax treaties so the whole thing fell apart just because we got the treaty but we can't get the
[28:41.760 --> 28:46.240]  treaties that's how much tyranny we're under let's jam in one more david in wisconsin you're on the
[28:46.240 --> 28:53.520]  air thanks for calling hey alex uh big fan of your show i have a pretty simple question uh
[28:53.520 --> 28:57.600]  my grandpa asked me because i was i was talking about stuff you talk about and trying to wake
[28:57.600 --> 29:02.400]  him up trying to wake up my family and all that and he asked me well what is it that i can do
[29:02.400 --> 29:09.200]  my generation can do and he's 70 years old that's you know pretty old he says what what can he do
[29:09.200 --> 29:14.720]  to uh help wake people up what is it he can do right now he can learn about the new world order
[29:14.720 --> 29:19.520]  he can understand there's more media than just the mainstream dinosaur media he can get involved
[29:19.520 --> 29:24.720]  he can run for city council he can go out and and read the bill of rights and constitution
[29:24.720 --> 29:30.560]  and then look around him and see what's wrong and then he can decide how to get involved good people
[29:30.560 --> 29:34.640]  all have to do just a little bit it'll bring down the tyranny the problem is good people become
[29:34.640 --> 29:40.080]  spectators believing that they have no basic power great question all right we're off to the races

[33:29.280 --> 33:45.040]  promotion picture has no equal we are now living the 1984 reality but there's the old
[33:45.040 --> 33:53.760]  parallel liberties of private property family guns male and female roles top globalist back in 1961
[33:53.760 --> 33:59.520]  before he died published brave new world revisited all this huxley at the time his brother ran the

[34:05.920 --> 34:10.160]  was the head of the world eugenics society by the way at the time and that was julian huxley
[34:10.880 --> 34:14.480]  and he gave an hour long speech at berkeley that we've played the whole thing of here multiple
[34:14.480 --> 34:21.760]  times over the last 18 19 years on air and in that speech he said look i debated my colleague
[34:21.760 --> 34:27.360]  eric blair george arwell as his pin name and i said he will not be the boot stamping in the
[34:27.360 --> 34:33.120]  black uniform that's waiting in the wings for those in the first few phases that resist no it

[34:55.840 --> 35:04.400]  ah and the people at berkeley are clapping ah oh we'll get to rule over the program

[35:09.840 --> 35:13.040]  people are going into puberty when they're eight now and you know the plan's going quite well
[35:13.040 --> 35:20.320]  oh they're feeding us gmo and again i'm not being negative down been down here in
[35:20.320 --> 35:26.080]  port aransas fishing and with my children you know we were not into fancy vacations they just
[35:26.080 --> 35:32.400]  like you know just the texas beach swimming in the pool and stuff and i've run into let's not
[35:32.400 --> 35:40.320]  exaggerate it's not exaggerate the manager of the of the condos we're staying at the listener
[35:40.320 --> 35:46.960]  here half the lifeguards are listeners it's a giant pool the biggest down here uh and
[35:49.120 --> 35:53.040]  i've run into just i'd say half of the middle age men i walk by our listeners
[35:53.840 --> 35:58.960]  uh the people at the restaurant are listeners and it's just everywhere i go people are listeners
[35:58.960 --> 36:05.840]  and then they say what do we do i mean you are the majority and i'm not even bragging i mean when a
[36:05.840 --> 36:12.560]  18 year old female lifeguard knows who i am and says that her dad listens and she listens i mean
[36:12.560 --> 36:19.120]  the new world order is in trouble i'm not bragging who i'm a celebrity i don't like being this popular
[36:19.120 --> 36:25.120]  going up against the globalist they're trying to indict steve pacenic that's on record for running
[36:25.120 --> 36:31.200]  cia operations in the 80s that were sanctioned mainly because he comes on the show and he's been
[36:31.200 --> 36:38.160]  told don't come on the show mi6 is visiting him and he's had a bunch of stuff happen i mean that's
[36:38.160 --> 36:42.960]  how real this is folks that i have to deal with my guests being murdered like the dc madham and
[36:42.960 --> 36:48.080]  others i have to deal with being physically attacked before i'm not saying boohoo what was me do you
[36:48.080 --> 36:54.880]  realize folks that i'm in combat in the info war toe-to-toe with the globalist and their dirty
[36:54.880 --> 37:00.560]  tricks and all the rest of it because they can track with google and the nsa the fact that our
[37:00.560 --> 37:06.640]  audience they know how big our audience is we don't they've got a better handle on it i don't
[37:06.640 --> 37:10.560]  have all the systems to know how many people listen i know it's about 20 million that we can
[37:10.560 --> 37:15.920]  track each week do you think they like that i want to go back to your calls it's just that
[37:17.520 --> 37:22.160]  they've got war games computer algorithms now where they can tell what things will tend to do
[37:22.160 --> 37:26.080]  politically off of similar things they've done before they can almost predict the future but
[37:26.080 --> 37:32.240]  they can't predict you wild carding and as an individual not following their programming
[37:32.240 --> 37:36.800]  and those two nexus points are coming together right now we're we're at the flashpoint here are
[37:36.800 --> 37:40.880]  some of the headlines and then i'll go to your phone calls and get any comments uh david night has
[37:40.880 --> 37:49.040]  on this let me pull up pull up drudge i just had drudge drudge i think has the best coverage of the
[37:49.040 --> 37:54.800]  burgdoll situation we can put it up on screen for tv viewers video burgdoll's release we can show
[37:54.800 --> 38:00.720]  some of that in the background report had been made to look ill report wanted to renounce citizenship
[38:00.720 --> 38:06.960]  team leader a lot more to the story than soldier walking away yeah my gut tells me he was sheep
[38:06.960 --> 38:11.520]  dept and this was super elaborate and that's why he's he has such courage they say and all the rest
[38:11.520 --> 38:17.920]  of it i mean i don't i think they're really trying to fool the economy network three more members
[38:17.920 --> 38:23.120]  of burgdoll's platoon speak out white house apologizes for oversight congressional notification
[38:23.120 --> 38:28.560]  it's an oversight when the law says 30 day over uh notification just like getting rid of your
[38:28.560 --> 38:32.160]  bill of rights and constitutions and oversight and signing statements are an oversight and
[38:32.160 --> 38:36.640]  saying nato's over our militaries and oversight and doubling your health care costs is an oversight
[38:38.240 --> 38:44.400]  miscalculated reaction who wrote rice's talking points this time ranking dim dangerous precedent
[38:44.400 --> 38:50.480]  that puts all americans at risk yeah it does rubio obama believes he's become monarch or emperor
[38:50.480 --> 38:57.760]  law professor president nixon always wanted to be what president obama has become again
[38:59.200 --> 39:07.680]  why do you have rubio this neocon golden boy we don't need a gimmick to get a libertarian
[39:07.680 --> 39:12.720]  and constitutional selected so we run a hispanic i vote for hispanic in a minute if they were like
[39:12.720 --> 39:16.480]  ted cruise and i would vote for ted cruise for president but it doesn't mean it's because he's
[39:16.480 --> 39:21.760]  hispanic i would vote for him or as a hispanic spanish last name it's because he can do a 28 hour
[39:23.120 --> 39:27.520]  fellow buster he's fought obama care he's fought for the second amendment they would have passed
[39:27.520 --> 39:33.360]  gun control that wasn't for ted cruise and ran paul and the american people okay i'm ranting i said
[39:33.360 --> 39:38.560]  i take calls the point is we don't need gimmicks but why is rubio talking like that now he's got
[39:38.560 --> 39:44.640]  a sound like a libertarian constitutionalist like ted cruise and ran paul to win the answer is
[39:44.640 --> 39:49.040]  radicalize the libertarian arm of the republican party the republican party is ready to fall
[39:49.600 --> 39:54.960]  to the liberty movement they admit that they're panicking all hands on deck with the democrats
[39:54.960 --> 40:00.080]  and republican leadership trying to kill the tea party that's why i'm full in to the tea party the
[40:00.080 --> 40:07.120]  real tea party to take over the republicans that's our shot 2014 is everything but now you notice
[40:07.120 --> 40:12.400]  that we got called kook saying he was becoming a dictator just three years ago now it's oh yeah
[40:12.400 --> 40:18.400]  he's becoming a dictator it's passe democrats republicans because we're the majority we've
[40:18.400 --> 40:24.240]  told the truth what we said is coming true they have democrats have websites saying that i mean
[40:24.240 --> 40:28.880]  every day i saw two of them yesterday without looking alex jones is crazy he says obama's
[40:28.880 --> 40:34.800]  becoming a dictator oh he's so kooky ah ha ha look at him that's so weak-minded people read that
[40:34.800 --> 40:39.840]  and think ah ha ha the military is going to be on the streets obama's becoming a dictator how funny
[40:39.840 --> 40:46.240]  me they're literally just using peer pressure with mindless democrats that can't even tie their
[40:46.240 --> 40:54.000]  shoelaces i mean i'm a liberal okay i want more freedom you are fascist scumbags there are a lot
[40:54.000 --> 40:57.680]  of well-meaning liberals who are freaked out by obama and they don't trust the republicans either i
[40:57.680 --> 41:02.160]  don't either but when the whole leadership is after the real tea party you better believe they know
[41:02.160 --> 41:06.160]  that's where the opposition is will they try to co-opt it will there be problems of course there
[41:06.160 --> 41:10.720]  will be but the tea party's not going to come after getting rid of the borders completely and
[41:10.720 --> 41:16.560]  legalize 30 million more illegals and take our guns and and and you know openly fund al-qaeda and
[41:16.560 --> 41:21.520]  and and you know say our kids belong to the state i mean this is mouse a tongue level what's going on
[41:22.640 --> 41:26.720]  they're just attempting to normalize the total takeover all right i'm going to go to your phone
[41:26.720 --> 41:33.120]  calls just please remember we have the very best nasa and aina out there the new x2 is beyond even

[41:43.120 --> 41:48.160]  x2 ladies and gentlemen is from crystals nobody else has this source it's other seaweed base this

[42:38.480 --> 42:42.000]  okay david night tell us what's coming up in the second and third hour today and then i want to
[42:42.000 --> 42:45.680]  race through phone calls right into the next hour i want you to continue with these calls
[42:46.320 --> 42:50.640]  well alex we're going to talk about the 25th anniversary at ten months square because
[42:50.640 --> 42:55.120]  you know cnn is patting itself on the back talking about the cnn effect how it was a watershed
[42:55.120 --> 43:02.480]  moment for cnn and really we want to compare what they did with the cnn coverage of tenement
[43:02.480 --> 43:09.840]  square to what cnn did when we had to stand off at the nevada ranch uh the and and bunkerville
[43:09.840 --> 43:13.680]  uh the bundy ranch perfect show the footage of you and josh valently walking up as they
[43:13.680 --> 43:18.560]  were threatening to shoot you and then tie it into uh chelchescu people hailed the pokes
[43:18.560 --> 43:22.880]  overthrowing them you didn't overthrow anybody you just stood up against thugs threatening you
[43:22.880 --> 43:27.280]  and you're being called a terrorist by harry reed that's right alex and you know we see that
[43:27.280 --> 43:33.360]  there's a cnn reporter who has just arrested in turkey for covering anti-government this rest there
[43:33.920 --> 43:37.920]  they that was a very brave thing that he did and they allowed that to go through that that was a
[43:37.920 --> 43:42.560]  good thing but you know at the same time remember that amber lions reports about what was going on
[43:42.560 --> 43:48.000]  essentially identical to that uh anti-government protests in bahrain they shut down her report
[43:48.000 --> 43:53.920]  so what does it tell us about the controlled media and when we look back at 25 years from china
[43:53.920 --> 44:00.320]  how does it what do we learn about how china the chinese government has controlled information
[44:00.320 --> 44:05.920]  about tenement square today and china the globalist in australia and the u.s and russia admit the
[44:05.920 --> 44:11.600]  chinese model of censorship is the model we've got to study an incredible job look forward to those
[44:11.600 --> 44:16.480]  special reports coming up and phone calls in the next two hours and daniel estlund thank you so
[44:16.480 --> 44:21.520]  much david night thank you alex all right now i've i've been bad please don't ask me thought
[44:21.520 --> 44:26.080]  revoking questions it gets me off on the jag let's go to your calls jay lin and texas thanks for
[44:26.080 --> 44:34.400]  calling you're on the air go ahead okay first point what uh ten cruise did uh it was not a
[44:34.400 --> 44:39.920]  filibuster well it technically was but they didn't count it as one because if they were already
[44:39.920 --> 44:47.280]  scheduled to rule on a vote at a certain time period so everybody got to call him out but
[44:47.280 --> 44:54.240]  arose as arose by any other name it's like yeah second point was that uh rachel carson was promoted
[44:54.240 --> 44:59.600]  on google doodle because she made a book that influenced the environmental movement and it
[44:59.600 --> 45:04.960]  was about banning dbt which resulted in millions and millions hundreds of millions of lives they
[45:04.960 --> 45:10.400]  admit about three million people die a year from dbt but they say it's a price worth it and it really
[45:10.400 --> 45:16.240]  didn't hurt the birds as bad as they said yeah it was a magical pesticide uh that helps humans not
[45:16.240 --> 45:23.920]  die a malaria absolutely right right and third point news rescue dot com promotes some of your
[45:23.920 --> 45:30.880]  stuff i read some very interesting information that people don't promote they want guns in their area
[45:30.880 --> 45:38.560]  uh in um Nigeria to protect themselves from the government and from these military groups because
[45:38.560 --> 45:42.960]  both of them are coinciding with each other some of them are people want guns in mexico
[45:42.960 --> 45:48.400]  to protect themselves people want it in africa god bless you great points yeah the only states
[45:48.400 --> 45:53.440]  that have any law and order in mexico are where the mexican farmers and ranchers people close to
[45:53.440 --> 45:58.720]  the earth i don't care what's leftist in siapas or right wing mormon christians in the northern
[45:58.720 --> 46:05.040]  mexico they get illegal guns in in texas and other places that are single shot and semi auto
[46:05.040 --> 46:09.600]  they lower the crime they stop the cartels and the mexican governments having to back off now and
[46:09.600 --> 46:14.560]  say okay let them be armed so the the only time you have nightmare extermination is when the state
[46:14.560 --> 46:20.160]  and the criminals have guns when the people have the guns the state and the criminals behave themselves
[46:20.160 --> 46:23.680]  because when the government fears the people there is liberty when the people fear the government
[46:23.680 --> 46:30.640]  there is tyranny thomas jefferson let's talk to mike and louisiana you're on the air thank
[46:30.640 --> 46:36.480]  alex while i was getting online uh the five bottle of x2 would relive it to me and it's

[47:00.400 --> 47:04.960]  uh the french quarter every day i want to say this this is how the cia went overthrow what they
[47:04.960 --> 47:09.040]  call dictatorships till they changed their policy in the fifties and started putting dictatorships
[47:09.040 --> 47:13.600]  in or in the sixties mainly they would have people go around with handouts bicycles and
[47:13.600 --> 47:18.320]  then sandwich boards with messages and enough of them it would overthrow the regime what you're
[47:18.320 --> 47:23.120]  doing with your bicycle with these big boards in new orleans if other people just did it an hour
[47:23.120 --> 47:28.000]  a week and put up handouts and just spread the word and called in the talk radio and called
[47:28.000 --> 47:33.280]  into c span enough of a buzz we would overthrow the globalists very quickly can i read you
[47:33.280 --> 47:40.800]  something i blogged yesterday in answer to what can we do and uh this is what i blog they only
[47:40.800 --> 47:45.920]  are granted the power we give them and we can start taking it away in a million ways right now
[47:45.920 --> 47:51.760]  so i didn't go no for our voices our purses and our passion peaceful civil disobedience is now our
[47:51.760 --> 47:57.200]  duty if you've never emailed your rage start now if you've never called call if you've never written
[47:57.200 --> 48:02.320]  right if you've never spoken out now it's the time to yell if for some reason you can't make
[48:02.320 --> 48:06.720]  yourself visible but still want to help and contribute to those that are putting themselves
[48:06.720 --> 48:12.720]  on the front lines in any way you can if they want a revolution that by god will give them one but
[48:12.720 --> 48:18.800]  one in our terms one that will be a revolution where the power of love will overcome the
[48:19.520 --> 48:26.320]  of power start now make a pledge say this is it call it the howard bill pledge tell them your
[48:26.320 --> 48:32.000]  med is telling you're not going to take it anymore very well said god bless you sir
[48:32.000 --> 48:37.040]  appreciate the call i have told the crew the great darren mcbrain the great rob do and others i
[48:37.040 --> 48:42.240]  want to promo made but i should come back and tape it and you know rant with a call to action
[48:42.240 --> 48:46.800]  have clips of howard bill saying i'm mad as hell i'm not going to take any more and call it the
[48:46.800 --> 48:52.160]  howard bill pledge to get aggressive to not back down and promote the ideas of liberty
[48:53.440 --> 48:58.240]  and that's what it takes because our country was so wealthy so free it took so long to dismantle it
[48:58.240 --> 49:04.800]  but now they're getting down to the final nuts and bolts great points matt in tennessee listening
[49:04.800 --> 49:12.000]  on wbcr 1470 you're on the air go ahead matt hey guys gents uh alex appreciate you let me on you
[49:12.000 --> 49:18.400]  sound racist because you don't like tenon square um this uh burton all guy uh i think this could
[49:18.400 --> 49:23.760]  come back to uh give us i i don't know if i'm thinking way outside the box here but his parents
[49:23.760 --> 49:28.800]  his dad uh uh seems to have a lot of knowledge with those people over there maybe they let
[49:28.800 --> 49:33.520]  him go and they let them five prisoners go that maybe they're going to try to do a false flag
[49:33.520 --> 49:39.680]  here in the next couple years to keep obama in uh he could set out martial law and then no election
[49:39.680 --> 49:45.600]  and then he could stay in what do you think about that i know we have pieces of the puzzle
[49:46.160 --> 49:51.600]  and anyway you slice it this is staged nobody would do what obama did it's a pr disaster unless
[49:51.600 --> 49:57.680]  there's something larger and i think it was just like red and dare would blow up oil wells that were
[49:57.680 --> 50:03.200]  on fire with a bigger explosion i think they did this in an emergency because they could track
[50:03.200 --> 50:09.120]  the va thing was going to boil over uh as a way to give a fake defeat of obama and to change the
[50:09.120 --> 50:14.080]  subject that could be part of it you have the cia section chief blown so it's probably coming out
[50:14.080 --> 50:20.560]  that burgle was a fake defector i'm speculating here but you add to this i'm just throwing the
[50:20.560 --> 50:25.520]  pieces out that he really did defect he did walk off base that was known staff sergeant joe bigs
[50:25.520 --> 50:30.080]  called me saturday and mackadoo called me sat leon and they were already on that before it was on
[50:30.080 --> 50:37.280]  cnn a day and a half later uh so this was well known this does not add up at any level and then
[50:37.280 --> 50:41.840]  you see shows like homeland and others with the narrative that fit this burgle thing exactly
[50:42.400 --> 50:48.240]  there they want the background of the idea that troops are al-qaeda troops are al-qaeda troops
[50:48.240 --> 50:54.240]  are al-qaeda to flip homeland security on their number one enemy the veterans show this this is a
[50:54.240 --> 50:59.840]  major sophisticated scion i haven't fared it out exactly we just know it's a scion stay there call

[56:54.560 --> 57:00.800]  over many years um you're talking about the one of the tv shows i was in like 12 episodes of three
[57:00.800 --> 57:05.520]  seasons and was a consultant on conspiracy theory ventura quit the show because he didn't like the
[57:05.520 --> 57:11.680]  direction it was going i was pretty much offered the show i turned it down uh great people involved
[57:11.680 --> 57:16.320]  then it's just the network was turning it into tuba cabras and space aliens and we didn't want
[57:16.320 --> 57:21.440]  to go that route now i do a show on history channel and discovery channel uh book of secrets
[57:21.440 --> 57:26.720]  and one other i don't even watch those shows i know with the ventura show they kind of edited
[57:26.720 --> 57:31.520]  what i said down to make it look like i was attacking ike i'm not mad at him i don't want to
[57:31.520 --> 57:37.040]  get the middle of it i've tried to get the two together uh but i totally misunderstood what
[57:37.040 --> 57:43.040]  was happening with reality tv they didn't want them to meet beforehand it took them an hour to
[57:43.040 --> 57:48.000]  get stuff ready he thought they were putting him off on purpose and the two guys are both real and
[57:48.000 --> 57:53.440]  they're both you know former you know athletes and ventura was a champion swimmer and other stuff
[57:53.440 --> 57:59.200]  and they just you know two two alpha males got in a literal argument you know on air and off air
[57:59.200 --> 58:05.760]  and i just there's nothing i can do about it uh and that's what happened and i just feel bad
[58:05.760 --> 58:09.200]  about the whole thing but that's already like two years ago and water under the bridge i mean
[58:09.200 --> 58:13.600]  what did they just re-air that or something on true tv because i i what do you bring it up
[58:14.320 --> 58:19.680]  no i i've just uh got a memory like an elephant i think you three are basically the most powerful
[58:19.680 --> 58:25.200]  people in the uh truth movement with the widest audiences and i think you guys need to get together
[58:25.200 --> 58:30.080]  uh well i'll say this i'll say this i think ike's on next week and i want to get ventura back on

[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:31.360]  we're seeing the precedent shed for total governmental lawlessness right now and that's
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:37.680]  an understatement with the nsa with the checkpoints for the tsa with the nato being over our military
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:43.040]  for four years and obama telling congress go to hell uh with the illegals being legalized who have
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:49.040]  felonies by the tens of thousands 36 thousand and one swath two weeks ago uh obama saying i'll
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:55.920]  release terrorists whenever i want and violate federal law it is unprecedented and even mainline
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:02.480]  arubio and mainline democratic law professors are on info wars dot com drudge report dot com
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:09.680]  today when david night's coming up we'll cover it all saying yeah this is dictatorship but see
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:14.720]  it's more sophisticated obama will leave office i predict he will leave office in two years
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:19.360]  and i don't know it's getting worse than i say sometimes i mean i underestimate
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:23.760]  they could nuke cities he says the number one thing he's worried about is nuke's going off
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:27.920]  he doesn't know who's going to do it you know army soldiers with al qaeda they've been floating in tv
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:34.320]  shows and movies and and mainstream tv news so i guess they're pre-programming they could do it but
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:40.160]  i don't think so the point is is they want the bureaucracy to be a dictatorship the bureaucracy
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:45.440]  to be dictatorial see they don't need the puppet to stay in folks they're setting the prayer to use
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:51.280]  our constitution like toilet paper let's go to john in wisconsin then david night's gonna come back
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:55.920]  and i want to get his take i'll be gone but i want his take on this this journey to train us to be
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:59.440]  under dictatorship and why they want to demonize the real press and then he's going to take your
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:04.400]  calls david night waiting in the wings about to take the baton john in wisconsin thanks for holding
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:11.200]  go ahead yeah i like to tell you how holiday holding up you know i've just learned that all work
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:18.720]  in no play makes jack uh not be good so jack will be taking more holidays than two weeks a year like
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:24.080]  i usually do to be with my children but i will be working and it seems like i get more done
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:29.520]  when i do take off than when i just keep coming into the office six seven days a week so it's
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:36.000]  going very well and i just feel reborn every time i take a few days off well you got a wonderful
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.960]  step there you should be able to relax a little bit once in a while you know that was the plan
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:45.360]  that was the plan in case they kill me the plan is to actually have people in place go ahead
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:52.480]  uh well what i was going to call about is this prisoner exchange you know this was fabricated
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:03:03.120]  it was rolled out on purpose and uh it could be the uh false flag that you've been talking about
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:06.560]  you know i don't think they're going to do a nuclear strike or anything like that because
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:12.320]  that kind of ruins the territory you know and they want territory so it's got to be this not
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:18.000]  only that the thing with the va it's been like that all the time ever since it was instituted
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:26.400]  by design i agree with you and everybody i've talked to or family or doctors that have worked
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:30.320]  in them have told me the same thing but it's undoubtedly from every vet i've talked to
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:34.640]  gotten the worst they've ever seen under obama do you agree with that statement or disagree
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:41.600]  yeah i do but you have to understand where obama came from the uh both uh the hospitals in
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:49.680]  chicago are on the corrupt list and they've always been that way hines and woods and um neither one
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:56.480]  of them had ever improved much and there's always been rumors of deaths and overcrowding and not
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:01.760]  getting in and all kinds of stuff so oh yeah no no they're a beta test of of death list they're a
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:09.200]  beta test of uh unplugging people they're a beta test of the uh death panels i mean this is our
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:14.480]  future and it's all just how to manage it and get away with it while they worship the vets to
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:19.120]  trick young people to join while they act like they're so patriotic to get reflected glory in
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:25.200]  the government they they literally homeland security admits veterans are their enemy they're
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:30.240]  going to blow stuff up and blame it on the vets they're coming for the vets it's outrageous and if
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:34.960]  we let a bunch of communists and foreign bankers get away with this we deserve it i don't think
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:39.520]  they're going to get away with it john what do you think i don't think you either because now that
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:48.240]  it's so widely uh and and everybody's mind and everything um uh something's gotta be done it's
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:53.200]  gonna be done because absolutely look they've gone too far it's pathological now i can feel

[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:18.560]  finishing the program day we're going to be taking your calls uh we're going to go to chat in south
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:24.240]  carolina in just a minute but before we do i want to have a little bit different perspective on what's
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:30.240]  going on burgall people are questioning what his motives were which side he was on they're talking
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:37.120]  about the release of the prisoners but i want to focus on the fact that obama clearly clearly
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:43.920]  broke the law how many times are we going to allow this to happen without taking action even
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:49.440]  diane feinstein is talking about obama breaking the law now now i know that when we get rid of
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:54.400]  obama there's going to be somebody just as just like him or just as bad perhaps even worse to
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:58.720]  take his place they've got plenty of clones of obama waiting in the wings to take his place but
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:06.400]  how long are we going to allow our highest government officials to thumb their noses at the
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:12.480]  law now this is what democrat diane feinstein said today she said it comes to us with some surprise
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:19.200]  and dismay that the transfers went ahead with no consultation totally not following the law that's
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:25.280]  from uh the uh that's from town hall dot com they report that totally not following the law
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:31.600]  that's diane feinstein so if he's like totally not following the law dude can we impeach him get rid
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:36.640]  of him replace him with somebody else i mean even joe biden it would at least be a warning it would
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:42.960]  at least be a movement in the right direction this comes two days after jeffrey tubin a harvard
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:48.880]  professor someone who identifies with the democratic party uh someone who's not necessarily as as
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:54.400]  linked into it as diane feinstein but clearly that's his point of view he was asked on cnn by
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:58.560]  wolf blitzer he says uh you've looked at the law you've looked at the signing statement you've gone
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:02.400]  through it said blitzer did the president break the law and he was kind of surprised when tubin said
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:11.600]  yes i think he clearly broke the law here's the deal the law says 30 days notice he didn't give 30
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:19.280]  days notice it's that simple there isn't any way that you can spend this he didn't give 30 days notice
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:26.160]  now obama is being reported declined to give a 30 day notice or as the white house says he
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:33.360]  he waived it because this guy bergdahl was supposedly an immediate danger really really can
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:39.760]  you make the case for that this is what tubin said he said it's true he issued signing statements
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:45.280]  but signing statements are not law it's the president's opinion about what the law should mean
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:50.240]  now it may be that the law is unconstitutional it may be that the law is a violation of his power
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:57.920]  as commander-in-chief but no court has held that the law is on the books he didn't follow the law
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:02.000]  and then blitzer says uh well you realize of course you're accusing the president of the
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.840]  united states of breaking the law he says well i don't think the president's too worried about
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:10.800]  what i think about this you know what the president isn't too worried about what anybody
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:15.840]  thinks about this whether anybody thinks he's breaking law that's what makes this also dangerous
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:21.840]  that's why we continue to head down this path just like the ndaa where the president signs that he
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:27.440]  believes that he has authority to indefinitely detain anyone using the u.s military that he
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:33.840]  can transport anyone using the military and of course that has been approved by guess what
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:38.800]  the republicans as well it's not just a obama thing it's not just a democrat thing they couldn't
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:46.800]  pass the ndaa and these statements that were put in there about suspending due process they couldn't
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:50.480]  have passed that without the republicans in the house so the republicans in the house don't have
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:56.640]  a problem with that either that's the big problem for us now at the bottom of the hour we're going
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:02.400]  to talk about the 25th anniversary of tenement square but just as a teaser i want to give you
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:09.040]  this this is a statement that kit daniels handed out to me this is from a pbs front line story about
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:15.440]  eight years ago in 2006 they interviewed a chinese journalist who was there at the massacre one of the
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:19.360]  things she said that i thought was interesting was she said we passed out copies of the famous
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:23.920]  picture that would be the tank man the guy standing in front of the column of tanks we passed out
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:30.160]  pictures of copies that famous picture to undergraduates at beijing university that's where the
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:36.960]  activism started and these undergraduate students today at beijing university were genuinely mystified
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:42.960]  one of them said i don't know uh maybe it's a parade or something another one said very politely
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:50.960]  may i ask is this a piece of your artwork how has the regime succeeded in wiping out recent history
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:54.800]  well we're going to talk about that we're also going to talk about some interviews with some of
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:59.360]  the people who were in the military at that time i want to get a perspective of the people
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:04.640]  who were in the military think about the guy in the tank not just about the guy in front of the
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:09.760]  tank the guy in front of the tank was amazingly courageous he had no reason to believe that
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:14.480]  these guys wouldn't just run him down and it's a good thing that the guys in the tank that day
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:21.120]  didn't do it but eventually they did eventually they fired on the crowd what was it that changed
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:25.360]  how did the chinese government manipulate the troops and the days leading up to this because
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:31.120]  this is not a one-day event this is something like weco that began back in the middle of april
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:35.280]  if i believe correctly if i remember correctly and it went to the beginning of june so this is
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:40.240]  something that developed over a period of about six weeks or so and during that period of time
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:48.960]  how did the chinese government control the chinese military to get them from respecting human rights
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:52.800]  and human life enough that they would not run over a man who was standing in front of them as
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:59.200]  protest how did they go from that to a situation where these guys would not only fire on unarmed
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:07.040]  civilians but that they would ban it them as well and we also have a clip from a man who was there
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:13.440]  25 years ago and he was also in boston a year ago and when he was in boston a year ago
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:20.320]  april 19th to celebrate patriot's day there he had something very interesting to say about the
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:26.080]  uh difference between armed demonstrators and unarmed demonstrators and we've seen that over
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:32.160]  and over again since i've been here at info wars and i saw it at the bundy ranch standoff so i want
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:37.200]  to talk about the difference and the way cnn covered the tenement square standoff i want to
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:42.640]  talk about the way they covered the bundy ranch standoff the difference in the way they covered
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:49.040]  this recent uh case of anti-government activity the anti-government demonstrations in turkey and
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:54.640]  the cnn correspondent that was arrested there for covering it and then the way the same network cnn
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:15:00.000]  shut down ember lion when she exposed the same type of activity in Bahrain the way they censored her
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:05.680]  they can sometimes be very real but sometimes it can be very fake if you remember the rock war and
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:11.120]  how you had the fake uh footage of the correspondents putting on the gas mask it was really pretty
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:16.160]  comical uh we've got that footage maybe we'll show that to you as b-roll for those of you watching it
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:21.360]  but they can be real and they can be really fake so we're going to talk about that later on but
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:26.720]  let's go to uh some of your calls right now uh let's go to let's see who did i have chat in
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:33.680]  south carolina chat hello mr night hey how you doing very good i actually called in about the
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:40.480]  federal reserve bank but i want to comment on the burdo not tenement square star yeah sure now i guess
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:46.480]  the bill clothes get meh or obama finally clothes get meh we see what's been open for so long and
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:51.600]  then on the tenement square um it'd be good if y'all get an uncropped photo of the famous photo
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:56.880]  i remember alex jones saying one time that those tanks go on for miles it's not just like three
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:06.000]  tanks yeah and then um about the federal reserve bank it is a private bank right yes yes absolutely
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:13.920]  are they a monopoly yes they are a competition that's right well like atc and t and when they
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:18.400]  were a monopoly and they were broke down okay so i wonder what like to cook brothers and donald
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:24.960]  trump or somewhat doesn't get together and compete with them maybe that's our late well there was a
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:30.000]  federal reserve act that was passed in 1913 that was manipulated by jp morgan he had manipulated
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:37.040]  a panic earlier before that jp morgan and other bankers got together ostensibly to
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:43.200]  keep from having anymore bank panics anymore runs on the banks and so they create the federal reserve
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:48.240]  system it's a federal reserve act so essentially it's an act of the government creating that private
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:52.960]  monopoly it is not essentially anymore as people have said it's no more federal than
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:58.640]  federal express but they do have a monopoly on that and of course there's many aspects that
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:04.400]  we could talk about that uh i would suggest that you take a look at a report that i did back at the
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:11.760]  100th anniversary of the federal reserve was just this last uh december and i did a report called
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:17.440]  it's a wonderful lie and i kind of compared the way uh and it's a wonderful life the way the banker
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:22.800]  in that movie manipulated a bank panic the way he was driven to take over everything in that small
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:30.320]  town i compared that to the history of the federal reserve that was censored very quickly by youtube
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:36.640]  even though the entire movie it's a wonderful life was up on youtube and has been up there for a
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:42.080]  couple of years and has had about a million views they took down my political commentary that was
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:47.520]  just a few clips and my comments about it they took that down claiming copyright violation
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:54.720]  that tells us where we are headed with syspa syspa acta pipa these different uh means of
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:59.040]  censorship that are masquerading as copyright protection the fact that they can take something
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:04.320]  down without any due process without you having a chance to have your say so about that and that's
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:08.320]  something that we're going to be talking about later when we talk about the media uh thank you

[01:18:55.120 --> 01:19:00.320]  that they're giving them notice to appear paperwork and then buying them a ticket a bus ticket
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:04.480]  anywhere inside the united states and that's been going on for almost two months that they're just

[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:30.080]  of this globalist agenda you know throughout europe they have the euro skeptic parties have
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:33.760]  been pushing back against the financial control you know we're just talking this last call i had
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:38.480]  questions about the federal reserve and central banks what they were trying to do was enforce
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:43.280]  centralized global control through a currency but another part of that was through uncontrolled
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:48.240]  immigration nowhere have they done that more so than in the united states we simply cannot have
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:53.120]  open borders and a welfare state it will bankrupt the country but that's what they desire to do
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:57.360]  they want to bankrupt the country and push us into competing groups that they can control
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:01.680]  pitting one group against another they tune would be right back we're going to talk about

[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:26.000]  want to give you a little bit of news though before i go to uh allen maryland this is a story
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:32.160]  up from paul joseph watson today secret service to track twitter users in real time the federal
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:38.240]  agency will use a tool to send notification to users this is from a request to purchase software
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:42.800]  so we can learn from this as paul joseph watson has done so many times this excellent research
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:47.520]  looking through what the federal government is proposing to buy finding out the capabilities
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:53.040]  and uh that they're looking for the specifications and we can see then what they're planning to do
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:58.880]  now in this particular case on this solicitation that was posted this week uh the secret service
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:04.800]  announced that it intends to use the tool to undertake listen to this sentiment analysis
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:10.160]  sentiment analysis influencer identification in other words where are they getting their information
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:17.840]  how do they feel about things access to their historical twitter data the ability to detect
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:22.960]  sarcasm oh that would be good if they could start to learn how to do that and heat maps that will
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:29.120]  show user trends not only that but they're going to be able to send notification to users so in
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:33.600]  case you're not intimidated enough by knowing that the government is watching and listening to
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:39.280]  everything you're doing they can send you a direct notification to tell you and to intimidate you
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:44.160]  but i want to go back to this thing about their ability to detect scar sarcasm if you remember
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:54.000]  it was uh back in 2012 that uh they had a story about a couple of british travelers who were
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.600]  coming to america and they tweeted that they were going to destroy america in other words a slaying
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:03.840]  for partying and that they were going to go to hollywood boulevard in la that's where they were
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:10.240]  traveling and they were going to dig up maryland munroe well it appears that they're going to
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:15.120]  have to make this software a lot smarter than the current live agents who are working for the tsa
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:21.760]  for homeland security for the secret service because these guys really believed that they were
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:26.560]  not only these these two a guy and a girl that they were going to destroy america that was their
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:31.440]  intention and as part of that i guess they were going to uh dig up maryland munroe and as they
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:37.040]  point out uh maryland munroe is entombed in a stone crypt so they were going to need more than
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:40.960]  uh just a shovel but these guys were interrogating them wanted to know where their shovels were
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:46.160]  they took them away handcuffed and took them to a jail in la kept them in separate cell for
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:51.600]  12 hours interrogated them and then eventually deported them so hopefully when the secret
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:56.640]  service starts tracking all these twitter feeds uh they will be a little bit more intelligent than
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:01.760]  the actual agents uh don't hold your breath so we're going to see what happens with that let's go
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:03.120]  to al and maryland al
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:08.960]  afternoon hey how are you doing dave uh i'm going to get to my point ladies and gentlemen we're
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:15.120]  living in 1939 eastern europe at this time and it's very important for people to understand
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:21.280]  that area 51 was all chesla everything that you're holding in your hands is weaponized all smart
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:26.720]  appliances everything has been weaponized i personally believe that ken trails are turning
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:33.600]  the oceans and all waters into battery acid etc uh i believe we're going to have a july 1st
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:39.760]  cyber attack which is going to move us into the cashless society they're running curfews in baltimore
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:45.920]  right now and that's your cue when they start running these curfews and i mean on regular folks
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:52.480]  this is your cue to understand they're going to roll out something serious i believe the bankers
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:28:01.280]  jumped from wherever the hell they jumped from and uh 23 bankers top echelon uh i believe that
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:09.520]  obama is being run by the umbra i do not believe that he's uh any kind we know who he is do we not
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:14.240]  well you know al i i agree that they are planning for something we see this with everything that
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:20.320]  they're doing i believe that their time frame is still 2020 2025 unless it happened i mean that's
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:23.360]  an approximate time frame that they're looking for and i think it's kind of interesting that no
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:29.280]  matter what they say about the future they have stuck to this time frame even as we get closer
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:33.520]  to it so now we're about six to ten years away from that time frame they keep sticking to that
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:40.080]  i believe that they understand as i've said before that not only does history rhyme but it also has
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:44.880]  a rhythm uh that's something that straus and how talked about in a book called the fourth turning
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:48.880]  they believe that we're coming up to a crisis event this is a book that originally there
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:53.520]  were a book called generations in 1991 they repeated it in 1997 called the fourth turning
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:57.520]  they were a little bit more specific about that focusing at that time and what they thought was
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:02.960]  going to be about 10 years away an event about 2007 2008 that they said was going to really
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:09.120]  shake the core of society start to set in motion things are going to ultimately result in some
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:15.600]  kind of a massive transformation of society and i believe that the elites who are planning these
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:19.040]  things the people who are at bill de berg the people who are operating the united states
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:23.920]  government at the behest they're aware of this timing they are planning for this they're planning
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:29.200]  for major social unrest we need to look at it and as a previous caller that was talking to alex said
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:35.760]  we need to know the power of love that can overcome the love of power we need to make our own plans
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:40.640]  for liberty and part of that is keeping information free when we come back right after the break
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:45.440]  we're going to talk about what has happened in china for the last 25 years in suppressing

[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:36.320]  and the importance of a free press and daniel estaline is somebody who has been fighting
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:40.240]  against the suppression of information as far as bill deberg goes he's been fighting against that
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:44.400]  for decades so we want to get his comments on that and we're going to be talking to him but in this
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:50.560]  next sector i want to talk about uh what happened at tenement square and the uh pre-seeing 25 years
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:56.880]  you know when this happened at tenement square they had a lot of american icons quotes they even had
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:04.720]  a statue of liberty there 1776 has inspired a lot of people around the world we were in kopenhagen
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:10.320]  people there were saying that they were bemoaning the fact that in kopenhagen they didn't have any
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:14.800]  founders who were saying the kinds of things about individual liberty that we had in america
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:19.440]  and even though our constitution is being subverted they said that's a very powerful thing that you
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:25.680]  can go back and fall back on that you know we have a product line called maiden 1776 it's one
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:30.640]  way that you can stand with us and stand behind us so that we can go to these places and report on
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:36.960]  these things you can find that at info wars store.com it's all made in america it is we've got
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:41.360]  competitive prices there we've got things like caps and belt buckles which i personally like to take
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:47.840]  with me whenever i go anywhere because uh i love the idea that this revolution that freedom that
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:54.720]  the principles that we have go back to 1776 and as we've said over and over again that is the answer
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:35:01.200]  to the orwellian 1984 state that they are building but we have men's and ladies lines of garments again
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:07.600]  that's made in america it's one way that you can patriotically support our operation here as well
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:12.560]  as businesses in the united states that are working making this it's not being shipped out to china
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:21.280]  so please consider that that's made in 1776 line at info wars store.com now on the 25th anniversary
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:29.040]  of Tiananmen Square it's interesting excuse me it's interesting for us to go back and look at what
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:34.160]  what people are saying now we have people who were there at the time making speeches there was a very
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:41.200]  interesting speech at a second amendment rally uh just a year or two ago a guy that was at Tiananmen
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:47.600]  Square that now lives in america he was talking to gun owners about the importance of having firearms
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:55.280]  he said both your founders here in this country as well as Mao understood that power comes out of
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:36:01.200]  comes out of the barrel of a gun that was Mao's quote but Mao also said that he was going to
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:07.520]  control the firearms and this is what else that fellow had to say at that rally in massachusetts
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:19.200]  23 years ago i was a freshman year college uh in china and i was exercising my freedom of speech
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:35.280]  and assembly in Tiananmen square we grew frustrated by the government of corruption we grew frustrated
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:43.440]  by the limitation of personal freedom so we demonstrated peacefully however the young
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:52.080]  passion patriotism were crushed by hails of food metal jackets by the ak-47s or some of you will
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:37:02.800]  say that's actually technically type four uh type 56 we could not fight back because we did not have
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:08.640]  an inch of iron in our hands to borrow a chinese expression we were not armed
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:18.560]  nice gun owners like us often say the second amendment is to protect her against a tyrannical
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:32.320]  government some would argue that a man with a rifle has no standing against the military
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:41.680]  technology and machine of today however i would say that 20 million citizens in veijing
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:48.640]  sure wish that they have some rifles to dispense at those days do you know that chinese constitution
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:55.840]  guarantees almost all the nice things that we have here it is written in chinese constitution that
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:38:04.880]  that chinese citizens enjoy a freedom of speech and religion they have human rights and property
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:14.080]  rights and such rights cannot take away without the due process of the law and do you know what
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:23.120]  chinese people do not have the rights to keep them bare arms i assure you all of those nice things
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:30.400]  written on chinese constitution are not worth the weight of the paper they're printed on
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:43.200]  because when government has all the guns they have all the rights absolutely when government has
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:49.120]  all of the guns they have all of the rights you hear the list of things that are recognized in
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:54.640]  the chinese constitution it sounds just like ours doesn't it but when you don't hold people to the
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:39:00.160]  law when you don't hold government officials to the constitution that they swore to we devolve
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:05.840]  into something no different from the chinese communist government now one of the things he
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:11.120]  said there is i said well people say that you can't use weapons against state-of-the-art military
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:18.320]  that it's not going to be effective and he said well what if 20 million chinese had had small
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:24.480]  firearms remember that when there was a standoff in the war saw ghetto originally the jews that
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:29.680]  were there didn't have any firearms i got a hold of a few sidearms and with that they held down a
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:33.760]  panzer division for quite some time for several weeks till they burned them out but i really
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:39.200]  want to focus on the first amendment because that is still a very powerful thing although it is
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:45.040]  guaranteed by our second amendment rights which act as a deterrent and we saw that act as a deterrent
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:52.080]  at bunkerville at the bundy ranch standoff i was there and every time i have gone every time
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:57.200]  since i've been here that we've had a demonstration that info wars has been a part of if people were
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:02.960]  simply carrying weapons not using weapons there haven't been any weapons used but if people have
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:09.760]  weapons on them the government behaves very differently the one time that i've seen out of
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:14.560]  the four where we've had a tense standoff like that the only time where people were attacked was
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:21.520]  when there was nobody that was armed it is a very effective deterrent but cnn as they're going back
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:25.600]  and looking at this they're kind of patting themselves on the back talking about the cnn effect
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:31.680]  in other words when they're there filming what's happening it kind of pulled back the chinese
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:36.640]  government they were there covering it live and after that people started to talk about the effect
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:43.280]  that a free press an honest coverage of an event had in terms of stopping tyranny now of course
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:48.080]  eventually they were not there when the government moved against the demonstrators they eventually
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:53.760]  got tired of that just as they did at waco and i want to look at how they have completely suppressed
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:59.760]  what happened there for 25 years you know for more than 25 years the government as well as the
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:05.040]  mainstream press was able to cover up the fact that bill de berg even existed it's been almost i
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:10.240]  guess it's been about what 22 years since waco we've seen the government cover up many of the
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:14.640]  things that have been done there even though there have been documentaries most american citizens
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:18.640]  have not gone back and revisited what happened there looked at those documentaries we've seen
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:24.640]  9-11 now we're 12 years into that that has completely remade our legal system and yet most
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:29.760]  people don't understand many things about that in spite of very good documentaries that have gone
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:35.120]  out one of those especially that alex was involved in and loose change 50 million people have watched
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:39.920]  that but many people are still ignorant of what's going on with that and as i read in the last
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:45.200]  half hour they went back eight years ago and talked to students at the university where the
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:51.360]  tenement square protests began they had no idea what this picture of the guy standing in front
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:57.680]  of the tank was but i want to talk about the fact that it's not a cnn effect it's a first amendment
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:02.400]  effect you know this is where cnn is bragging about the fact this is a watershed story for them
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:07.520]  this is where they really took off where people really started paying attention to them because
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:14.400]  they were going 24 hours a day and of course cnn did have some good work earlier this week they were
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:21.040]  covering unrest in turkey and they had a journalist there his name is watson no relation i guess to
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:27.280]  our journalist watson but he was hassled and he was arrested he courageously covered these
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:32.080]  stories that were going on there and yet we've also seen another side to cnn we've seen that when
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:37.840]  they were going into uh when the iraq war was beginning we saw them fake uh reports that were
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:42.400]  supposed to be live on site with gas masks a very funny video that we've shown over and over again
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:48.400]  here at info wars we have seen that they shut down the people who were higher up shut down
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:54.640]  amber lion when she exposed anti-government rallies in Bahrain uh she eventually left cnn
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:43:00.240]  because of that censorship she said i couldn't believe cnn was making me put what i knew to be
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:08.800]  government lies into my reporting so they can be real they can be fake i saw them at their worst
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:14.240]  as an example of the control of the american media i saw them at their worst at the uh
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:19.120]  bundy ranch standoff they showed up a couple of days after we got there they were there for one
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:23.200]  day as far as i could tell they were not there's that for anybody watching it there's that clip
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:28.080]  of where these guys were performing in the studio back in atlanta pretending that they were on site
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:35.920]  uh in iraq and pretending that there's incoming gas mask this is totally fake guys uh so but
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:42.640]  going back to the nabata ranch standoff they went in they came in with a cnn truck planted
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:46.800]  it front and center on the second day that we were there they went around and they started
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:52.240]  trying to find the fringes people they could so they could do character assassination on the people
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:56.960]  who were there they failed to show up at this showdown they considered that it was all finished
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:01.200]  because they'd been given information by their government controllers that they were going to
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:07.360]  allow bundy to now graze his cattle but they were not giving his cattle back so the people that were
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:13.280]  there went down to get the cattle back i was standing there and i listened to the lies and the
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:21.920]  disinformation that were fed out by cnn fed out by people like glenn beck uh cnn interviewed bundy
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:27.120]  later on and called him a welfare queen they completely misrepresented his arguments they
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:32.720]  didn't make the arguments for what he was doing but they also completely misrepresented what happened
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:37.840]  during that standoff they when they had him on they said so are you some sort of a welfare queen
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:43.760]  and a cowboy hat is the way that they came after him that is what we've seen a pattern of behavior
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:48.560]  that we've seen over and over again this goes back to the 1950s to operation mockingbird that
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:54.160]  was created by the cia to control the press we've seen this in spades bill de berg and that's
[01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:59.360]  why we want to talk to daniel estalon about that aspect of free press the fact that there would be
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:05.760]  no coverage on the outside while the heads of large media organizations like the wall street
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:11.120]  journal like the washington post like the new york times would meet privately inside of bill de
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:17.120]  berg with these world leaders at the same time that they were meeting with them they would pretend
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:22.400]  that it didn't exist they would ridicule and laugh at the early investigators like jim tucker daniel
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:27.760]  estalon alex jones who had exposed this they pretended that it didn't exist but let's look
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:35.840]  at how in the tenement square event i want to get behind some of the things that have have
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:41.120]  come out behind the story from the people who are there the soldiers who are there now the first
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:46.400]  thing that most people remember the main thing that most people remember is that courageous fellow
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:53.200]  who stood in front of the tank and as this a bc news article said they said uh little is known
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:58.000]  about the man who blocked the path of the column of tanks and timon square 25 years ago he's been
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:03.840]  called tank man the unknown rebel the unknown protester nobody knows what happens to him now
[01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:09.520]  there's been some reports that he smuggled his way out he got out to taiwan that's cold water's
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:13.680]  been poured on that by a lot of the protesters and journalists who were there they don't believe
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:19.040]  that that's what happened personally i think that a fellow like that was probably front and center
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:24.640]  when the killing began i i doubt that he made it out of there so but but i look at that and i think
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:30.480]  about the tank driver you know when we were at bunkerville there were people in the white house
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:36.480]  that least one person suggesting that they use drones on those people who are there
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:43.200]  when we were criticized for having women and children in front which didn't happen by the way
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:49.520]  that was a supposition of a retired sheriff uh sheriff mac who said that that did not happen
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:54.560]  sheriff mac was not even there there was no plans to do that it in fact did not happen
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:59.920]  i was there i was walking with those people at front that absolutely did not happen
[01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:06.640]  but we were harangued about that but even though we were there even though we stood that down
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:10.960]  peacefully we were criticized as being the provocateurs as being the dangerous ones
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:16.320]  they took a picture of one guy who was pointing a weapon and they ignored the fact that we had
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:21.120]  weapons pointed at us the entire week that they were pointing weapons at us at that time that
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:27.040]  they were threatening over a loudspeaker to shoot us if we didn't go back uh i look at this though
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:32.560]  and and i'm grateful that they didn't give that order to use drones i'm grateful that the soldiers
[01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:38.560]  and the uh the blm contractors that were there that they didn't fire they would have been remembered
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:44.080]  as murderers that would have set off a chain of events that would have been huge that did not
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:50.960]  happen in tenemen square instead eventually they did fire eventually they did what this person this
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:55.680]  is uh someone who was a 20-year-old student this is a parent of a 20-year-old student who was among
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:48:01.920]  the first to die and they said he was shot in the head in the shoulder and in the chest by advancing
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:08.720]  troops and then he was deliberately skewered through the belly with a bayonet he was one of hundreds
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:15.760]  perhaps thousands of chinese citizens that were slaughtered during that period of time now in spite
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:22.400]  of that in spite of that there is collective amnesia in china 25 years after tenemen square according
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:29.360]  to the la times they say that uh they give examples of people who are now under house rest this is
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:35.520]  the way that they're keeping this quiet they control the press they control the textbooks and they
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:41.920]  control the dissidents every year one of these participants who's continued to uh live in beijing
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:45.760]  every year about this time of year he's put under house arrest and not allowed to go out
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:51.600]  it says that the government has long determined to impose a collective amnesia about the weeks
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:57.760]  long pro-democracy demonstration that shook cities across china 25 years ago they're controlling it
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:03.840]  american style now instead of going in and putting this down with uh with troops who are
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:08.800]  shooting and killing people running over them with tanks now what they do is they silence them by
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:14.880]  ignoring it by censoring the information this guy who's under house rest says i think we need
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:19.120]  another june four that's what they call it they don't call it tenemen square like we do he says
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:24.480]  i don't mean we need another incident full of blood i need i mean we need millions of people
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:31.520]  to go to the streets and to demand change that gets their attention when people showed up
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:38.400]  to protest the banker bailouts on 912 when the tea party showed up in mass in washington
[01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:44.720]  that got their attention we haven't seen anything like that before or since but we need to follow
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:50.640]  through on that we need to understand that we can peacefully turn this back and we need to also
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:56.560]  understand that soldiers can peacefully turn this back now another quote here from the la times it
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:02.720]  says in 1989 the communist party tried to lock the doors of major campuses and universities
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:09.440]  so that students would not take to the streets but they still found a way out after 1989 they found
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:15.920]  a way to lock their thinking to lock their minds that's what one of the demonstrators that was there
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:24.160]  and they said that locking comes from a powerful cocktail of materialism cynicism and national
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:30.880]  nationalism i'm sorry fostered by the party's headlong embrace of a market economy and government
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:36.720]  sponsored patriotic education campaign see that's the way they bought their silence they bought
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:42.640]  their silence by giving them economic prosperity and telling them that you can have that but you
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:49.280]  cannot cannot talk about politics how far away are we from that we see that our government is trying
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:53.040]  to censor politics we see movements and we're going to talk about that right after we come back
[01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:58.640]  from break stay tuned we're going to talk about movements to create shielded journalism as well

[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:18.480]  dot com welcome back to the alex joe show i'm david night and we've just been talking about the
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:22.800]  25th anniversary of tenement square and i said i wanted to get behind the scenes i want to hear
[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:29.280]  stories from the army's side and there was an article from the new york times uh two days ago
[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:33.520]  and they had a quote from one of the generals they he was called in and told that they wanted him
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:39.280]  to use his troops against civilians there and he refused to do it he said i would rather be beheaded
[01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:45.600]  than to be a criminal in the eyes of history that is a choice that american soldiers are one day
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:53.520]  going to have to make we know that the american military has targeted domestic dissenters as
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:58.000]  terrorists we know that they were planning for this in their scenarios we've walked the streets
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.640]  info wars reporter i was there with the staff sergeant joe biggs we walked through a town
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:09.040]  that they have built specifically to practice for martial law this is not after they've gone in with
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:14.160]  the air force and blown up an area with the shells of buildings that they're taking over
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:19.840]  this is an area where they still have all of the glass in the buildings the traffic lights
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:24.960]  are still working they're going in and practicing taking over a town that in every detail is an
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:30.880]  american town and they have one that the marines are using down in camp lejeune as well that has
[01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:36.800]  suburban areas that has farm areas this one that we went to and this is a file footage that they
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:41.120]  shot we were actually able to go in and walk those streets a couple of weeks ago that is what
[01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:45.440]  they're preparing for so they're going to have to determine someday whether they're going to just
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:50.800]  stand down as this general did or whether they're going to stand up to the tyranny that's what he
[01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:55.600]  did not do and i want to read you a quote from one of the soldiers that was there he was only
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:56:00.400]  17 years old at the time he was with a group of 10 000 soldiers again this is from the new york
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:06.080]  times he said that for three days there were weary marooned soldiers who clutched their rifles in
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:10.240]  the wilting sun you recalled how residents and students would bring them food and escorted them
[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:15.760]  to toilets all the while bombarding them with a message that theirs was a just cause even in the
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:20.000]  restroom there was no reprieve he said if one student would go horse yelling another would
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:25.440]  take his place so this is a group of soldiers they're surrounded this is 10 000 soldiers but
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:30.720]  they're surrounded by many many more people who were telling them what this is about trying to
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:35.920]  educate them well what happened was the government was concerned that these troops are going to join
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:40.960]  the people so they pulled them out of there and they sent the soldiers to a reeducation camp
[01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:46.480]  and for 10 days they said former soldiers said they were fed a confusing diet of indoctrination
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:52.240]  at their encampments on the outskirts of beijing they studied the speeches of mr ding who was the
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:57.680]  leader there they were told that the demonstrators were the work of a subversive minority bent on
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:03.600]  toppling the communist party sounds very much like the way they portray the tea party in america
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:10.800]  now you have to educate yourself you have to understand and you have to understand where your
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:15.840]  compass is what are your fundamental principles that you're going to stand on and will you stand
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:22.720]  down or will you stand up to this type of tyranny when it comes to america and then finally to look
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:27.120]  at how they have suppressed this information over the years what does it take in order to do that
[01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:32.640]  well it takes control of the means of communication and we see that this is happening in america now
[01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:38.240]  we've got the FCC asserting its ownership over the internet we see that they're probably going to
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:44.320]  allow Comcast the number one largest provider of information in the united states controlling the
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:50.240]  pipelines as well as much of the content to absorb the number two that would be time warner
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:59.200]  if that happens and that's combined with a removal of net neutrality what you're going to have is
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:06.000]  effective censorship if people cannot get broadband without paying extra for it if some
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.840]  outlets independent outlets cannot afford that their voices are not going to be heard
[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:17.200]  when we were at Copenhagen there were many individual journalists there those honest journalists those
[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:23.520]  real journalists they will be swept aside in a regime where there is no net neutrality that's
[01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:28.160]  what they're working on they're also working on even fundamentally changing the first amendment
[01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:32.640]  that's what democrats are suggesting democrats like chuck schumer we're going to talk about that
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:34.720]  right after the break stay tuned we'll be right back
[01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:47.280]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
[01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:55.280]  why does the united states spend the largest percentage of gdp in the world on health care
[01:58:55.280 --> 01:59:01.280]  why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet the highest rates of diabetes autism

[02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:21.600]  be he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:28.160]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night in this hour we're going to be talking to
[02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:34.560]  daniel estalon he's one of the reporters who for years followed and reported on bill deberg as it
[02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:41.920]  was ignored censored and his coverage was ridiculed by the mainstream media who leaders were there
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:45.840]  at bill deberg meeting inside at the same time they were spiking stories about it
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:52.960]  and ridiculing anyone who reported on it but this all brings up what is happening with
[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:58.240]  freedom of speech as we look at what happened in tiananmen square 25 years ago as people stood up
[02:00:58.240 --> 02:01:03.920]  for their rights and how the chinese government has been able to suppress everything that has
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:09.680]  happened there as the students from the university of beijing have no idea what this picture of the
[02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:14.320]  man standing in front of the tanks is about is that an art piece was this a parade they don't
[02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:20.160]  understand that's their questions can that happen here in america i believe it can i believe it has
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:24.080]  happened here in america we've seen numerous examples of it bill deberg is just one example of it
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:29.280]  we've seen disinformation and lies about many things that happen domestically even though the
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:35.280]  american press may honestly cover things that are happening in other countries they will cover up
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:40.400]  and feed the government's line out about these things that are happening domestically as we saw
[02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:44.640]  at the nevada ranch standoff they completely misrepresented not only the history of the
[02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:51.360]  background and the beef that the bundes had no pun intended with the removal of the cattle there
[02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:57.600]  but they also misrepresented what happened that day now when we look at what's going on with the
[02:01:57.600 --> 02:02:02.160]  first amendment one of the ways that they're going to control the first amendment besides going
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:08.880]  through the fcc controlling the pipes allowing mergers changing that neutrality using the trans
[02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:15.280]  pacific partnership the transatlantic partnership agreements to enact syspa sopa pipa actor those
[02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:19.760]  kinds of restrictions on the first amendment they're going to enact those who these partnerships
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:23.760]  and that's what i want to talk to daniel estalon about because that is essentially what's been
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:29.360]  planned by the bill deberg group for decades that kind of economic control of information
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:35.280]  but now we see that democrats are suggesting that perhaps the first amendment needs to be modified
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:40.400]  that they need to put restrictions on what people can say politically now we see that one of the
[02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:47.600]  supporters of this idea is democrat senator from new york chuck schumer he says that no amendment is
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:51.360]  absolute he says not even the first amendment he says of course we've got restrictions on
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:57.360]  pornography and libel those are part of a balancing test well he knows or should know
[02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:04.400]  no and i'm sure that he does know that pornography and libel are not political speech what he's
[02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:09.760]  trying to do is suppress political speech the first amendment was not set up to protect
[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:15.920]  somebody putting a crucifix and a vat of urine but it was set up to let us have unrestricted
[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:20.720]  comment about what's going on politically and in this in these decisions from the supreme court
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:25.520]  that the democrats are reacting against in citizens united one and two in my opinion
[02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:32.400]  and what was happening there was them standing by the fact that political speech is an absolute
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:38.000]  and we should not have that taken away by having our ability to pay for that political speech taken
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:44.160]  away i know at least in citizens united two that was a case that involved very small players this
[02:03:44.160 --> 02:03:49.040]  was not the coke brothers but if you think that the coke brothers have too much influence then what
[02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:54.320]  you need to understand take a look at the history of the rico statue the rico statue took away
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:59.920]  people's ability to defend themselves who do process they realized that the mafia was repeatedly
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:04.640]  getting off of charges because they could hire the very best lawyers to get them off so they
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:08.320]  decided well the way we're going to handle that is we're going to confiscate their financial assets
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:13.440]  their ability to defend themselves in court at the beginning now originally they used the
[02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:19.440]  rico statutes only against the mafia but then they started using it against abortion protesters
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:25.120]  now we saw just a few months ago there was a supreme court case went all the way to supreme
[02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:29.840]  court and the supreme court allowed this they said that even though there was a couple that
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:34.240]  was accused of stealing medical devices taking out a loan on their home to pay for their legal
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:40.480]  defenses that the prosecutors could confiscate that money prior to their being convicted of
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:45.920]  anything depriving them of the means of their self-defense so if you're going to take away
[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:50.720]  due process for the mafia you're going to take away due process for mom and pop who are accused
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:55.520]  of something if you're going to take away freedom of speech for the Koch brothers you're going to
[02:04:55.520 --> 02:05:00.000]  lose it yourself now stay tuned right after the break we're going to be talking to Daniel Estolin

[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:18.080]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night this hour we're going to be talking to
[02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:23.840]  daniel estalina man who has researched for years and written a book on the history of the billderberg
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:29.040]  group he was ignored for many many years and so we're going to talk to him about how it felt to be
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:36.080]  a voice crying in the wilderness that was ignored or ridiculed for what he reported but of course
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:40.560]  as you know if you're a follower of info wars we were there last week as the billderberg group was
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:46.720]  meeting in 2014 in copenhagen and one of the people that i had the pleasure to talk to was a
[02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:52.560]  former member of the danish parliament his name is ole gestrum and this is what he had to say
[02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:58.800]  and so it gets out in the newspapers and the television etc and then we have the whole
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:04.640]  control system if you look at the control press what we can also easily see here in copenhagen
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:12.800]  although everything here looks peaceful calm uh we have a control press we can see that in many
[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:18.560]  aspects like how they cover 9 11 you know 9 11 is a subject which is not to be talked about that's
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:23.440]  right do not question the official story that's right he understands that they have a control
[02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:29.600]  press he's a member of parliament he's seen it i've been places i see i report on what i see and i
[02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:34.320]  see the way the mainstream media lies about it media that weren't even there that's what we saw
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:41.840]  the novata standoff of the bundy ranch now an australian news source a bc but it's not the
[02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:47.040]  american broadcasting system it's the australian broadcasting corporation uh they reported on
[02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:51.280]  tenement square and they said decades ago the party decided the best way to deal with this
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:56.960]  painful history that would be tenement square hurt death division following an attack on unarmed
[02:10:56.960 --> 02:11:02.320]  civilians that its own leaders ordered that the best way to deal with this history of tenement
[02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:09.280]  square was to simply pretend that it didn't happen that's been going on for a long time
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:14.880]  about a lot of different issues bill de berg is just one of those so we join on the line now with
[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:20.240]  daniel estaline daniel are you there i'm here thank you so much for the invitation as always it's
[02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:26.160]  great to be on the show it's one of my favorite programs uh personal planet television and and
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:30.000]  web pages it's you have to understand it and watch it if you want to know what's going on in the
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:35.200]  world well thank you for joining us daniel i want to uh first before we talk about some of the things
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:41.040]  like the agenda uh and maybe any new news that you've got there i'd like to talk to you and just
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:46.400]  give us your feel about what it's like to be covering something for decades as as you did as
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:53.040]  jim tucker did and to have it completely ignored by people uh by the press especially or to be
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:12:01.520]  ridiculed um you know again i my book uh i think i i'm a bit of an exception to this particular case
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:05.600]  because my book the true story of the bill ever group when i first came out in the united states
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:11.680]  in 2007 it had already sold over three million copies in spain and now ten years later bill
[02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:17.840]  de berg my book has sold almost seven million copies in in 64 or 66 countries has been translated
[02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:23.120]  into 42 languages and uh you know i think i'm in part responsible the fact that bill the burgers
[02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:26.800]  now have their own web page and they published information about the meetings and about the
[02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:31.760]  attendees list but that said it's obviously true that the mainstream press in the united states
[02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:36.960]  and the world over doesn't cover these events now media control and media manipulation doesn't mean
[02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:43.120]  that you have a monolithic big brother serves up one and only one uh distorted version of reality
[02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:49.280]  now the media cabal defines the parameters of what is news and therefore it shapes the latitude
[02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:54.320]  of the public discourse and also the range of policy options available for the debate so it
[02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:59.040]  continuously disinforms and misinforms and basically it dumps down the population and what's
[02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:03.920]  imperative to understand is that no matter which media outlet you read watch sure for listen to
[02:13:03.920 --> 02:13:10.000]  whether it's new york times washington post media in europe or in asia or you know it doesn't matter
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:15.840]  where the entire mainstream and most alternative news sources are controlled by the same interlocking
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:21.840]  devices that attend organizational meetings such as the bill de berg trilateral commission meetings
[02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:27.280]  council for relations etc etc again mainstream press forms part of the world's elite they're
[02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:32.240]  part of this juggernaut which is why again if something of value or interest does come out
[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:37.120]  in the mainstream press is because all they have simply no way of covering up or they need to serve
[02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:43.040]  up up an alternative perspective to get people diverted from the reality that media sources
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:48.080]  such as yourself and alex johnson prison planet dot com you know explain and put out to the world
[02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:51.520]  i think that's a very important point that you brought up it's not like there's some ministry
[02:13:51.520 --> 02:13:56.640]  of truth at setting over everybody i mean there is just as we see it the bill de berg group
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:14:02.800]  wouldn't you say there's kind of a an inner core of people who really do have common values and they
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:09.440]  kind of use this consensus creation technique kind of like the way they do at agenda 21 meetings here
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:15.040]  in the in the us they use kind of a ran corporation technique where they bring people in and they kind
[02:14:15.040 --> 02:14:19.600]  of test them to see if they can get them to buy into the consensus if they can't like margaret
[02:14:19.600 --> 02:14:24.480]  thatcher then they get rid of those people but if they can get very powerful people to buy into
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:29.600]  this to believe in and to to join this consensus then they become part of that group they start
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:34.560]  coming back year after year and essentially i think that's what's happening with the mainstream
[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:38.960]  press as well they very quickly get the idea even though they will come in occasionally
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:45.360]  like they did with amber lion and just spike a story people understand what they want to be
[02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:48.960]  covered and what they don't want to be covered and wouldn't you say that's the case the greatest
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:52.720]  the greatest form of control is when you can manipulate the population into believing
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:57.280]  that they're free while they're being dictated to and manipulated by the man behind the curtain
[02:14:57.280 --> 02:15:01.680]  and of course one form of dictatorship is being in a prison cell seeing the bars you know you
[02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:06.160]  you're there you can touch them but the other is a far more subtle form of dictatorship
[02:15:06.160 --> 02:15:10.560]  is when you cannot see the bars and you think you're free and of course the biggest hypnotist
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:16.640]  in the world is that you know box in the corner of plasma or whatever we want to call it you know
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:21.040]  that basically tells people what to believe and the television with its reach into everybody's
[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:27.200]  homes basically has created this reality our attorney's reality for mass brainwashing of
[02:15:27.200 --> 02:15:33.680]  citizens and this has been one of the greatest forms of creation of control by the man behind
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:40.320]  the curtain yeah the ability to make people think that they've arrived at this consensus
[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:45.600]  decision based on their own thinking rather than being manipulated into that and that's what we again
[02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:50.880]  we see with this delphi technique they bring people in they subtly control the agenda control
[02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:57.840]  what's presented to them just as the media and even the media that is showing fictional stories
[02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:05.440]  they will present a range of choices to them and gradually steer them to the to make the right choice
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:10.160]  wouldn't you say basically you know television what it does is it causes people to suspend
[02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:15.040]  their critical judgment capabilities because the combination of sound and images places
[02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:19.840]  individual in a dreamlike state which basically limits their cognitive powers and when that's
[02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:24.160]  done you're creating an alternative reality and that's what public opinion is all about and that's
[02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:30.320]  why you know americans will think that they're basically governed by some bureaucrats in washington
[02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:35.760]  you know who make laws and end out money but that's wrong americans are ruled americans canadians
[02:16:35.760 --> 02:16:40.800]  europeans everybody were ruled by our prejudices and their prejudices are organized by public
[02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:45.920]  opinion and so we think that we make up our own minds about everything okay because we're very
[02:16:45.920 --> 02:16:52.080]  conceited as people and public opinion makes up our minds it works basically our herd instinct
[02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:56.560]  like we're frightened animals okay but there's a great big difference between a man and an animal
[02:16:56.560 --> 02:17:02.160]  and that's something that most people unfortunately don't understand very true now let's talk about
[02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:07.600]  some of the information that you got prior to the meeting uh the leaked secret agenda we reported on
[02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:13.920]  this uh may 30th kit daniels wrote this up uh there were seven large items that you talked about
[02:17:13.920 --> 02:17:18.880]  have have you gotten any more information besides this these were uh let's just read these for the
[02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:23.840]  people who are listening the number one was nuclear diplomacy russian china even iran working
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:29.920]  together to wrote western hegemony uh an agreement between russia and china on many uh different
[02:17:29.920 --> 02:17:35.200]  economic aspects the rise of nationalism within europe and of course that happened just before
[02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:39.600]  the bill de berg meeting there were elections throughout europe for the european parliament
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:46.160]  and those who are standing for a stronger european union were rejected decidedly in elections in one
[02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:50.560]  country after the other uh the european union's internet privacy regulations that's something
[02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:56.960]  that is i see that coming about via the transatlantic partnership agreement just as americans are
[02:17:56.960 --> 02:18:01.280]  going to be hit from both sides with both the transatlantic and a trans-pacific partnership
[02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:06.320]  where they take away our internet freedom the rise of cyber warfare of course we had uh
[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:11.760]  uh keith alexander we had uh former head of the nsa we had general patrice former head of
[02:18:11.760 --> 02:18:17.200]  the cia we also had companies like palantir alex carp that were there those guys have been there
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:20.880]  multiple years i would say they probably bought in the consensus would you say so
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:26.560]  absolutely some you know i again i i'm still sitting through all the information i got from
[02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:30.640]  my sources but i can tell you there's several issues we can talk about ukraine we can also talk
[02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:36.400]  about uh the uh the russian the chinese agreement there are some uh points of disagreement between
[02:18:36.400 --> 02:18:41.280]  american and european bill bergers and what you just mentioned the transit ttp transatlantic trade
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:45.200]  and investment partnership basically you know the idea is to put businesses and driving seat
[02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:50.080]  allowing them to bypass the world trade organization not also give transnational corporations
[02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:54.880]  a power boost largely eradicating the influence that respective governments have on trade in other
[02:18:54.880 --> 02:19:00.160]  words again the whole concept of one world company limited corporations was far more
[02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:04.400]  power than any government on the planet now if you kind of look at what was actually discussed
[02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:10.560]  now what are the organizations most responsible for this tremendous growth all right in the world
[02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:14.880]  hunger we can start with is the world trade organization which was created after the second
[02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:20.880]  world war by internationalists in washington to serve as a wedge to kind of the push free trade
[02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:26.320]  among major industrial nations especially uh the european community now if you kind of read their
[02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:31.120]  publicity in the propaganda the world trade organization established a framework for creating
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:36.560]  non-discriminating reciprocal trade policies now the reality is very very very different
[02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:44.800]  the wto's anti-national state intent can be really seen in the 1988 sloven one world one market
[02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:47.920]  and that slogan came from gap general agreement of tariff and trades
[02:19:47.920 --> 02:19:51.760]  hang on hang on daniel uslin we're going to be right back to talk about bill de berg and that's
[02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:57.600]  what we saw i tell you what a free trade agreement you don't need thousands of pages of documents
[02:19:57.600 --> 02:20:01.200]  negotiate in secret to get free trade if that's what you really want there's another agenda

[02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:31.520]  on bill de berg if you have any questions this is the guy to talk to he's been following this
[02:24:31.520 --> 02:24:37.200]  for decades even as the domestic press and the international press pretty much pretended
[02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:43.440]  that it didn't exist daniel estalan jim tucker alex jones and others were still on the story
[02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:47.840]  covering it and if you have questions for them questions for daniel we'll be taking that in

[02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:18.720]  to daniel estalan that number is 800-259-9231 now just before the break daniel we were you
[02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:24.400]  were talking about the world trade organization we really see these agreements like the trans
[02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:29.840]  pacific partnership the transatlantic partnership they pretty much mirror the trilateral commission's
[02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:37.120]  goals of uniting first regional economies under things like the european union under nafta and
[02:25:37.120 --> 02:25:41.600]  then pulling these all together into a global governance so we now see those trade partnership
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:48.240]  agreements as essentially formalizing that into into law into treaties would you say is that
[02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:52.400]  what they're working on is that one of the major agendas world trade organizations regulations
[02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:58.160]  nations are basically prohibited from protecting local economy or tax goods even when these goods
[02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:02.560]  clearly were produced with slave labor and furthermore nations are not allowed to give
[02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:08.800]  preferences to local economies that hire local people at decent wages to produce goods that then
[02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:13.120]  benefit the local businesses and economies people who pay taxes played by the rules
[02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:18.560]  and also reinvested this you know money into the local and national markets the truth is free
[02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:24.160]  trade is rigged trade and the fairness question is basically diversionary propaganda for diluted
[02:26:24.160 --> 02:26:29.760]  lawmakers and then the public it is run by an international financial cartel and this cartel
[02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:34.480]  interests they control a playing field who plays and the rules of the game and when you expand
[02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:39.840]  the cartels control into strategic areas such as food for example the situation gets serious
[02:26:39.840 --> 02:26:45.760]  in a hurry yeah and as i look at these agreements for example multinationals are elevated to the
[02:26:45.760 --> 02:26:52.720]  level of sovereign states and yet local businesses people who live and work in countries they don't
[02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:58.160]  have a voice in this and i think it's also amazing how these trade or these trade partnerships are
[02:26:58.160 --> 02:27:04.080]  being created in a secretive environment that essentially mirrors the way bill derbergh operates
[02:27:04.080 --> 02:27:09.440]  no one who is elected no senator no congressman from america or any of these other countries
[02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:12.960]  is allowed to see the documents as they're being created the only thing that we have
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:18.160]  from these secretly crafted documents that are being worked on the only thing that we see is
[02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:24.000]  what comes out from wiki leaks and we see that it affects a lot more than just economic trade it
[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:30.640]  affects our freedom on the internet it affects our ability to decide what we want in our food or
[02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:34.480]  whether or not we're going to have information about what's in our food of course they want to
[02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:39.840]  be able to censor that in other countries just as monsanto and other corporations have been able
[02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:45.040]  to effectively censor information about the content of food here in america you brought up a very
[02:27:45.040 --> 02:27:48.800]  interesting point about as far as corporations and what they're doing exactly how they're controlling
[02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:55.280]  the trade now during 1968 bill derbergh meeting in montreblanc in canada george ball was the
[02:27:55.280 --> 02:28:00.560]  undersecretary of for economic affairs with jfk and lyndon johnson he gave a presentation titled
[02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:05.840]  internationalization of business where he defined with the new bill derbergh policy of globalization
[02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:10.160]  was going to be in how it would shape the policy of this international new world order because when
[02:28:10.160 --> 02:28:14.160]  we're talking about bill derbergh we're not talking about one world government new world
[02:28:14.160 --> 02:28:19.440]  order we're talking about the concept of one world company limited so in this 1968 bill derbergh
[02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:24.640]  conference in canada george ball who at the time was of liven brothers he announced a project to
[02:28:24.640 --> 02:28:30.480]  build what he called the world company and the idea is that nation states that were outmoded there
[02:28:30.480 --> 02:28:36.320]  are cake forms of government so in a malthusian world they can rely on two for example because
[02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:40.800]  again tend to believe that the resources in that country belong to them instead of to the people so
[02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:45.200]  they created this new form of government and they call it a corporation and the idea will be that
[02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:49.920]  this world company would then become the new government and if you kind of look at globalization
[02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:56.800]  that's exactly what this is beginning in the 1960s then into the 70s and the 1980s the united
[02:28:56.800 --> 02:29:01.680]  states and the rest of the world was literally taken over by this rush of mergers a larger
[02:29:01.680 --> 02:29:07.120]  consolidation of industrial companies agricultural companies financial companies and they were slowly
[02:29:07.120 --> 02:29:12.400]  building these giant cartels you know to the point but we're seeing how today these giant cartels
[02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:17.040]  which control the resource of the world effectively around the world so this is what this concept of
[02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:21.760]  world company project literally is all about and if you kind of think about the fact that
[02:29:21.760 --> 02:29:28.800]  they proposed it as their key point for the future back in 1968 that's 45 years ago yes you know it
[02:29:28.800 --> 02:29:33.280]  should be scary or should scare the hell out of anybody and we've now seen that pretty much in
[02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:38.880]  every sector you care to think about look at the massive consolidation of whether it's the banking
[02:29:38.880 --> 02:29:43.840]  industry whether it's communication business or whether it's even retailing how it's all
[02:29:43.840 --> 02:29:48.800]  consolidated pushing out the middle-class business owner we're going to be right back with Daniel

[02:33:27.120 --> 02:33:31.920]  esteland tireless reporter about the bill de berg group he's had many inside sources we're going to
[02:33:32.560 --> 02:33:38.240]  have questions for daniel from our callers about bill de berg we also want to find out if he's
[02:33:38.240 --> 02:33:44.080]  got any new information he released seven items that he believed from his insider sources we're
[02:33:44.080 --> 02:33:48.080]  going to be on the agenda so we want to see if he has any more information about that and we're
[02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:55.440]  going to talk to him also about china and the 25th anniversary of tenement square because china is a
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:34:01.600]  key player in the globalist taking over the industrialized base of the west and moving
[02:34:01.600 --> 02:34:06.560]  it to china where they can more easily control it but before we do i want to put in our pitch here
[02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:11.520]  because this is what pays for us going to these different places whether we're going to copenhagen
[02:34:11.520 --> 02:34:16.960]  to cover bill de berg or whether we're going to cover the protests in novata what pays for
[02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:21.920]  those trips what pays for our ongoing expenses here as a media operation are the products that
[02:34:21.920 --> 02:34:29.760]  we sell and is something that helps you as well as helping our organization now as we've talked about
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:34.160]  many times the globalists are digging in alex has repeatedly said on the show that they're
[02:34:34.160 --> 02:34:39.040]  moving up their end game the day is coming where they're going to take over the food supply where
[02:34:39.040 --> 02:34:44.480]  they're going to contaminate the food supply to the extent that you won't be able to find anything
[02:34:44.480 --> 02:34:49.440]  to eat we have a very fragile infrastructure here it doesn't take much to collapse that the

[02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:39.920]  some callers and take their calls but just before we do i want to ask uh daniel what do you make of
[02:35:39.920 --> 02:35:46.000]  these 25 years with jenomin square and how the globalists how how rockefella has admired
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:51.920]  mal and the chinese communists how he spoke in glowing terms of them even after the cultural
[02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:57.520]  revolution starved millions of them perhaps tens of millions of them completely eviscerated
[02:35:57.520 --> 02:36:03.600]  the middle class the sorts of things that we see could possibly happen with uh contamination of our
[02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:09.280]  food supply by the large corporations or the kinds of things that are coming out of bill
[02:36:09.280 --> 02:36:14.560]  de burg daniel uh did you want to say something about uh china day because we are talking about
[02:36:14.560 --> 02:36:18.880]  the 25th anniversary of tianna square now to most people old enough to have seen it on television
[02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:25.920]  the tianna square student protest in bijing in in june 1989 i shrouded an image of the cnn slowly
[02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:30.480]  protested with a shopping bag dressed in a white shirt and black trousers blocking a column of
[02:36:30.480 --> 02:36:35.920]  tanks where few people realized that tianna was an early attempt by the united states intelligence
[02:36:35.920 --> 02:36:41.040]  to interfere in the internal affairs of people's republic of china and also to implement what later
[02:36:41.040 --> 02:36:46.800]  came to be called color revolutions you could also call them made in america coups similar color
[02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:50.880]  revolutions will lay around by washington and serbian against milosevic in ukraine with the
[02:36:50.880 --> 02:36:56.640]  so-called orange revolution george's rose revolution that unseated at russia varnadze and also other
[02:36:56.640 --> 02:37:02.400]  geopolitical destabilizations aimed at creating washington-friendly regime changes it has very
[02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:07.520]  little to do with you know with popular protests has nothing to do whatsoever with spontaneous
[02:37:07.520 --> 02:37:12.800]  revolutions there's no such thing as a spontaneous revolution it is a well-planned very expensive
[02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:19.040]  revolutions of coup d'etats made in america yeah that's what uh they're talking about at
[02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:23.280]  bill de burg i'm sure they were talking about what's going on in ukraine and we've had admissions by
[02:37:23.280 --> 02:37:28.240]  the state department that they have spent billions of dollars to get that started in the ukraine
[02:37:28.240 --> 02:37:33.040]  and now they're going to be spending uh over a billion dollars uh obama has pledged that
[02:37:33.040 --> 02:37:37.440]  to the europeans that he's going to give them a billion dollars to essentially provoke a new
[02:37:37.440 --> 02:37:42.000]  arms race and a new cold war that's what's going to come out of this i'm sure the military
[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:46.080]  industrial complex is going to love that well i can tell you that you know there's some very
[02:37:46.080 --> 02:37:50.720]  interesting discussions going on at the bill de burg conference how we've talked the last time
[02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:54.960]  was on alex jones show just before the meeting that one of the agenda items obviously i mean
[02:37:54.960 --> 02:37:59.280]  we didn't even need bill de burg to tell us that they were in response the whole deal with russia
[02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:05.600]  and the chinese and but the point was how to keep putting in place and away from causing damage to
[02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:11.360]  the international globalist order now the european and american bill de burg is this time around for
[02:38:11.360 --> 02:38:17.520]  the first time since 2002 went at each other's throats to a certain extent back in 2002 jim
[02:38:17.520 --> 02:38:21.680]  tucker reported it back then there were at each other's throats for the whole thing about the
[02:38:21.680 --> 02:38:27.520]  war upcoming war in uh uh in iraq this time around it was china and russia now the european
[02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:31.520]  bill de burgs were saying to the american bill de burgs okay you want us to impose sanctions we
[02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:36.480]  did and now not only did we impose sanctions without any effect whatsoever but the russians and the
[02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:42.080]  chinese through the back door made a deal and this deal is worth 400 billion dollars it's an
[02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:47.040]  enormous gas deal so what are we gonna do now because in the end if you want us to impose
[02:38:47.040 --> 02:38:51.440]  more sanctions the european bill de burgs are saying to the american bill de burg is is going to hurt
[02:38:51.440 --> 02:38:56.080]  our economy not you and the americans are saying we need you to stay together with us because we
[02:38:56.080 --> 02:39:00.800]  need to hurt puddin now there's some silver lining to this deal because again on the one hand
[02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:05.920]  bill de burg does agree it's a nightmare scenario china and russia working together and now iran
[02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:10.960]  also joining the phrase we have china iran and russia working together it's a very difficult deal
[02:39:10.960 --> 02:39:20.320]  to sabotage the china russia gas deal because uh the whole the uh the uh you cannot get to the uh
[02:39:20.880 --> 02:39:25.440]  to actual pipeline because they're so far inland that you cannot they cannot be sabotaged
[02:39:25.440 --> 02:39:30.800]  and neither to say it's a deal which came in just in time for puddin it shows on the one hand that
[02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:36.720]  put dust of allies you know to seek to blunt western sanctions over ukraine and also helps
[02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:42.000]  both russia and china to assert themselves as regional powers that said american bill de
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:46.480]  burgs we don't know them by name because in the bill de burg reports we don't have the names we just
[02:39:46.480 --> 02:39:53.040]  says american bill de burg a european bill de burg a member of french uh um political circles
[02:39:53.040 --> 02:39:57.920]  and so on and so forth what we do know is that one american bill de burg said or reminded the
[02:39:57.920 --> 02:40:02.720]  rest of the people at the meeting that over 40 years ago richard nixon and kissinger were able
[02:40:02.720 --> 02:40:07.680]  to persuade china to turn against the soviet union and ally with america and so then they asked
[02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:12.640]  this rhetorical question so does today's collaboration between russia and china amount
[02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:17.680]  to renewal of this alliance against america now what is absolutely served as bill de burg has
[02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:23.760]  agreed if western banks stop lending money to the russians to the chinese banks will come in
[02:40:23.760 --> 02:40:29.440]  will step in and lend russians the money now the chinese badly need the natural resources
[02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:35.120]  which russia has an abundance and this gas deal obviously eases china's concern that most of its
[02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:40.320]  fuel supplies comes to the strategic show point on the streets of balacca that americans can close
[02:40:40.320 --> 02:40:45.840]  at any point if there are real hostilities between the united states and china and this deal also
[02:40:45.840 --> 02:40:51.280]  enables china to move away from burning so much of its coal that pollutes the air in the chinese
[02:40:51.280 --> 02:40:56.560]  city now despite that these are obvious advantages for the chinese and the russians the russians and
[02:40:56.560 --> 02:41:01.040]  the chinese have some very important differences which they need to overcome and one of these
[02:41:01.040 --> 02:41:07.120]  differences is the fact that bill de burg has convinced that chinese is taking advantage of
[02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:12.240]  puddin's predicament drove a very hard bargain knocking down the price something which left
[02:41:12.240 --> 02:41:19.360]  the russians with a bad taste in the mouths now another thing is that the the the central asia
[02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:25.600]  russia and china that's their area of of influence now the chinese want the russians
[02:41:25.600 --> 02:41:31.120]  to recognize china as the global powerhouse in the economy and the russians want the chinese to
[02:41:31.120 --> 02:41:37.120]  recognize them as the military power so we do have these tensions which we're talking about
[02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:42.480]  yeah it's interesting to note that you know when push comes to shove you have this enormous border
[02:41:42.480 --> 02:41:46.640]  between the russians and chinese on the one hand on the one side you have lots of natural
[02:41:46.640 --> 02:41:51.520]  resources of few russians and on the other side you have no natural resources and lots of chinese
[02:41:51.520 --> 02:41:57.120]  and as again as one american bill de burg had reminded everybody in the room that many of russia's
[02:41:57.120 --> 02:42:02.800]  tactical nuclear weapons are still pointing at china so again what we will see in the near future
[02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:07.920]  is that bill de burg and western powers and western media are going to try to play out china
[02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:13.360]  against russia try to drive a wedge between these two countries but i think if puddin and the chinese
[02:42:13.360 --> 02:42:18.240]  governments are smart they'll stay together they'll because they realize that temporary gains
[02:42:18.240 --> 02:42:24.240]  by joining the united states are not towards long-term losses fascinating analysis i i want to give
[02:42:24.240 --> 02:42:29.200]  the callers a chance to ask some questions let's go to anthony and florida anthony do you have a
[02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:34.880]  question about bill de burg for daniel estalon hello hello anthony do you have a question for
[02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:42.480]  daniel estalon about bill de burg actually i i i have a comment okay um i think that the i think
[02:42:42.480 --> 02:42:47.200]  that the globalists are actually becoming quite sloppy when it comes to conducting
[02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:55.760]  their um their uh their policies against everyone else because before they were in the shadows
[02:42:55.760 --> 02:43:02.400]  conducting it and now it's as if they're they're they're losing their um their way as far as um
[02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:08.640]  trying to trying to dictate policy on everyone else well that's interesting because certainly
[02:43:08.640 --> 02:43:14.400]  there's been a massive revulsion about what was the european union and the euro and of course
[02:43:14.400 --> 02:43:19.360]  that was by admission of etienne davignon that was something that was planned by the bill de burg
[02:43:19.360 --> 02:43:24.320]  group but now that people have seen how that's working how that's been implemented against
[02:43:24.320 --> 02:43:28.720]  them how they have lost their sovereignty there's been a massive revolt against that throughout
[02:43:28.720 --> 02:43:34.480]  europe wouldn't you say daniel what we have right now especially with the rise of of nationalism
[02:43:34.480 --> 02:43:38.320]  you know in england and france and in other parts of of europe now sound that nationals
[02:43:38.320 --> 02:43:44.320]  are fewer fashions that's obvious but others such as the case of nagel ferrache uh with you keep in
[02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:49.760]  england or or marie le pen marie le pen in france this is not fashions at all these are nationalism
[02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:53.600]  and what we actually have and there's something that bill de burg in european community are very
[02:43:53.600 --> 02:43:59.840]  much concerned about is we have two systems and going at each other and depends which system with
[02:43:59.840 --> 02:44:04.080]  we'll see how the world is actually is going to shape itself or play itself out in the near future
[02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:08.960]  the one system is the monetary system and the other one is a national credit system okay now if
[02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:13.200]  you're smart you don't want to monitor your system throughout the world you want to sovereign nation
[02:44:13.200 --> 02:44:17.680]  state to have their own credit system which is a system of their currency and of course this is
[02:44:17.680 --> 02:44:22.880]  firmly stated in the united states constitution and of course it was excluded by the maastricht
[02:44:22.880 --> 02:44:27.920]  treaty as a method of determining of economic and financial policies and needless to say what
[02:44:27.920 --> 02:44:33.760]  we're seeing right now okay in europe is exactly this and it's insane to belong to this kind of
[02:44:33.760 --> 02:44:38.880]  a group because in europe you don't have any kind of credit system it's all monetary system run
[02:44:38.880 --> 02:44:44.160]  but this banking system which is european central bank needless to say belonging to bill de burg
[02:44:44.160 --> 02:44:47.920]  and all these other organizations there is no government there's no nation it's just a group
[02:44:47.920 --> 02:44:53.280]  of nations run by a private bank and of course what we're seeing right now okay the supposed
[02:44:53.280 --> 02:44:59.840]  independence of the central bank is the decisive control mechanism for private financial interests
[02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:04.640]  which historically in europe has been installed as an authoritative instrument against an economic
[02:45:04.640 --> 02:45:08.960]  policy of sovereign governments oriented towards the general affair and of course the european
[02:45:08.960 --> 02:45:15.120]  banking is a remnant of a fuel society in which private interests acidified by the ancient venetian
[02:45:15.120 --> 02:45:20.240]  cartels or by the lombard league which went down on the dark ages in the 14th century and this one
[02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:25.120]  we have today again two systems the monetary system which controls europe and the national credit
[02:45:25.120 --> 02:45:29.680]  system which have in the united states and something which exclusively and expressly was
[02:45:29.680 --> 02:45:36.240]  excluded from the european negotiations and we've seen that with uh nigel frange was was
[02:45:36.240 --> 02:45:42.560]  very eloquently pointed out uh how amazing it was that goldman sacks bankers could be used to replace
[02:45:43.440 --> 02:45:48.640]  duly elected leaders in both greece and italy and people in those countries are waking up to that
[02:45:48.640 --> 02:45:55.680]  as well let's take another question from mike and louisiana mike yeah so thank you mr night
[02:45:55.680 --> 02:46:01.200]  david i have a question for you and then mr estelon the first one is kind of lay hearted but
[02:46:01.200 --> 02:46:08.720]  i'm a uh artist activist and i have designed a cliven bunny for president t-shirt that i would
[02:46:08.720 --> 02:46:13.920]  love to gift you so i would like that you know when i spoke to him personally he reminded me a
[02:46:13.920 --> 02:46:20.000]  great deal of ron paul and he had a ron paul support a ron paul sign there in his yard uh he
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:25.440]  reminded me very much of ron paul so i would vote for him over uh anybody that's been offered to us
[02:46:25.440 --> 02:46:29.920]  by the traditional parties over the last few years of course you know they oppose ron paul and
[02:46:29.920 --> 02:46:34.480]  and uh people like cliven bunny go ahead what's your question for daniel estelon how can i get
[02:46:34.480 --> 02:46:39.680]  how do i get that shirt to you and how can i be assured you'd receive it uh what i what hang on
[02:46:39.680 --> 02:46:45.040]  after the call and we'll try to get uh the the fellows here on the board to give you that information
[02:46:45.040 --> 02:46:49.360]  i don't want to give that out over the air but um or actually you could send it to the po box that's
[02:46:49.360 --> 02:46:53.680]  at our website to my attention and to get to me that'd be fine i'm sure that would all right i'd
[02:46:53.680 --> 02:46:57.920]  also like to get that other information just to make sure i'd like confirmation on that now if i
[02:46:57.920 --> 02:47:04.320]  did ask mr estelon the question please sure go ahead uh mr estelon i read your book it's excellent
[02:47:04.320 --> 02:47:10.640]  some years ago and i congratulate you on your work and your tenacity and exposing the building birds
[02:47:11.920 --> 02:47:17.120]  i'd like to ask is it do you think it'll ever get to a point because of the exposure duty uh
[02:47:17.120 --> 02:47:22.400]  you and mr then uh the late mr jen tucker uh do you think it'll get to the point where the
[02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:28.640]  builder bird will stop meeting or maybe find some other clandestine way to go ahead and go about
[02:47:28.640 --> 02:47:36.320]  their devious methods i think uh i i think it's important to put builder bird in perspective
[02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:40.160]  organization organizations such as builder bird tri-lateral commission council for relations
[02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:45.120]  pretty nice circle these are not the seats of power they're the conveyor belts the real decision
[02:47:45.120 --> 02:47:50.080]  making process is always and has always been you know taken and done at much higher levels
[02:47:50.080 --> 02:47:54.320]  the thing is is that you know when my book came out suddenly people discovered builder bird because
[02:47:54.320 --> 02:47:59.120]  before that we kind of knew that you know someone was doing something to someone you know it was a
[02:47:59.120 --> 02:48:03.040]  you know coup d'etat someone was you know taken out or killed and somebody else was put in their
[02:48:03.040 --> 02:48:07.600]  place you know you had price magnations and shenanigans going on behind the scenes but we didn't
[02:48:07.600 --> 02:48:12.560]  know really who was doing it how it was done and though my book came out suddenly these they
[02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:16.560]  who were nameless and faceless had a name and a face and we knew what they were doing and we knew
[02:48:16.560 --> 02:48:20.640]  their deeds and we saw the documents and the photographs and it was easy to say aha these
[02:48:20.640 --> 02:48:24.880]  are the bad guys but they're not the bad guys in a sense that one understands a bad guy from a
[02:48:24.880 --> 02:48:30.480]  Hollywood film uh again the real decision making is that at a much higher level than builder bird
[02:48:30.480 --> 02:48:36.080]  builder bird is mid-level executives yes there are some very powerful people because they're powerful
[02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:40.320]  because they're popular uh there's someone like a david rockefeller for example you know you may
[02:48:40.320 --> 02:48:45.120]  say that he's very very powerful he's not the fact that there's a hundred million pages with
[02:48:45.120 --> 02:48:50.000]  rockefeller's name on google doesn't make him powerful it makes him popular yes he's wealthy
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:54.640]  you know when you compare it to us but no he's not wealthy or powerful when you compare it to the
[02:48:54.640 --> 02:48:59.840]  people who run the world from behind the scenes because the real people who move the world from
[02:48:59.840 --> 02:49:06.000]  behind the scenes they're invisible we don't even know their names that's how powerful they are
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:12.160]  there's a difference between power and popularity rockefeller's powerful but he is visible the real
[02:49:12.160 --> 02:49:18.320]  power is invisible and i can give you one name fresco baldis which is the right the root of all
[02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:23.760]  the royal families in europe now if you actually go and google their name you may get a couple of pages
[02:49:23.760 --> 02:49:28.720]  and they're talking about their wine exports and in rome there's a little tiny little plaza
[02:49:28.720 --> 02:49:33.760]  you know that has their name but these are some of the most powerful people in the history of
[02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:39.760]  mankind and nobody knows their name or the fact that they even exist because they don't appear
[02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:44.720]  in the newspapers they don't have you know community centers there are buildings then after them
[02:49:44.720 --> 02:49:50.080]  they are invisible but they're omnipotent when you compare it to the people that we're talking about
[02:49:50.080 --> 02:49:54.560]  what kind of building were conferences thank you very much let's go to uh give another question
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:50:01.600]  from julio in illinois julio you have a question for mr esterland i do uh mr esterland uh

[02:54:22.320 --> 02:54:26.800]  about this year and one of the things that was on the agenda was climate change and it's de
[02:54:26.800 --> 02:54:32.080]  industrialization before we get his answer about that i wanted to let you know that this half hour
[02:54:32.080 --> 02:54:37.680]  of the alex jones show has brought to you by survival shield x2 that's one of our products at

[02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:22.560]  now mr esterling uh you had a question just before we went about climate change and its involvement
[02:55:22.560 --> 02:55:28.320]  in de industrialization and what the people at billberg were talking about i haven't uh gone
[02:55:28.320 --> 02:55:33.120]  through or there's extensive information from my sources literally passed me all the information
[02:55:33.120 --> 02:55:37.280]  which is discussed at the meeting and i simply with all the interviews i've been doing worldwide
[02:55:37.280 --> 02:55:41.680]  because i'm getting calls from 30 countries i have not had a chance to actually read that
[02:55:41.680 --> 02:55:46.080]  information i haven't gotten to it yet i can tell you what they've discussed as far as the
[02:55:46.080 --> 02:55:50.960]  ukraine is concerned we've talked about the uh their oil and gas deal with the russians uh i
[02:55:50.960 --> 02:55:55.440]  can tell you what they're talking about the uh the controversy between angela merkel and david
[02:55:55.440 --> 02:56:00.640]  cameron as far as the appointments of the lisbon treaty but very little thus far as far as the
[02:56:00.640 --> 02:56:05.680]  climate change i will know in the next few days tell us about david cameron because we saw ed ball's
[02:56:05.680 --> 02:56:12.160]  there he had a huge amount of paperwork that he was bringing in uh to the bill de berg conference
[02:56:12.880 --> 02:56:16.400]  he got carted and he didn't have his identification with him as he was searching through his luggage
[02:56:16.400 --> 02:56:21.200]  we could see a massive amount of paperwork and of course he's from a different party than david
[02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:26.000]  cameron uh what what's your information about the david cameron well you have you know the pardons
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:30.560]  and you're talking about again european union the pardons and i decide a pushing angela merkel
[02:56:30.560 --> 02:56:35.920]  and david cameron to the fight that neither one of these wants not the naskiness of the possible
[02:56:35.920 --> 02:56:40.560]  appointment of john claude joker who's the president of luxembourg ex-president of luxembourg
[02:56:40.560 --> 02:56:45.680]  as the next president of the european commission it's all all too predictable now the origin of
[02:56:45.680 --> 02:56:51.280]  the whole trouble lies in the 2009 lisbon treaty which basically changed the procedure to select
[02:56:51.280 --> 02:56:55.360]  the new president of the commission of the commission and that replaced the european constitution
[02:56:55.360 --> 02:57:00.160]  which was scrapped in the name of this lisbon treaty was just a you know bait and switch trick
[02:57:00.160 --> 02:57:05.920]  to impose the span world the pan european laws and regulations on the community of nations which
[02:57:05.920 --> 02:57:09.760]  are very little to do with one another it's very interesting to see over the next little while
[02:57:09.760 --> 02:57:14.080]  what's gonna give because it needs to say in england the situation is critical you keep one
[02:57:14.080 --> 02:57:20.000]  they destroyed all the other parties their position is very very strong their pro nation state pro
[02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:24.720]  social welfare and we're seeing the same thing going on in france and the idea again that behind
[02:57:24.720 --> 02:57:29.040]  this fight there are two financial systems you have the monetary right and you have the nation
[02:57:29.040 --> 02:57:34.320]  state credit systems and depends on who wins is also depends very much whether we're gonna have
[02:57:34.320 --> 02:57:41.360]  a referendum in in england over the next couple of years before the next elections in 2015 or not

[03:00:53.680 --> 03:01:01.360]  question or comment today well my comment was i was hitting point by point as alex and your
[03:01:01.360 --> 03:01:07.120]  and and your organization has pointed out for years the demonet demonization of uh veterans
[03:01:07.840 --> 03:01:15.600]  the purge of the military command the va scandal burgdoll scandal and i can't help but think
[03:01:15.600 --> 03:01:19.520]  there's been a lot of talk about oh i think the mainstream media is turning on obama and
[03:01:19.520 --> 03:01:25.840]  they're reporting about this well i have another take on that if um if you'll bear with me i i
[03:01:25.840 --> 03:01:37.360]  believe that this is a deliberate uh provocation of the military and uh other patriots uh to to
[03:01:37.360 --> 03:01:45.920]  exercise emotions to a boiling point so that they can pull off a false flag and then blame it on
[03:01:45.920 --> 03:01:53.040]  veterans or patriot groups who were provoked to anger by these by the ineptitude of the president
[03:01:53.040 --> 03:02:01.760]  and um uh further uh five years ago i was the republican nominee on the 99th district of virginia
[03:02:02.480 --> 03:02:08.160]  and uh this will all tie together if you can bear with me i'll try to go ahead um i was
[03:02:08.160 --> 03:02:15.840]  contacted we we the first district is is a massive waterfront district uh bordered by the
[03:02:15.840 --> 03:02:23.840]  uh petomic and the rappahannock river at any rate i was contacted by some retirees up in uh montroth
[03:02:24.560 --> 03:02:30.960]  virginia who were upset because ogara was moving into their community and apparently they had
[03:02:30.960 --> 03:02:36.960]  greased the skids of the board of supervisors to approve them as a school that's how they got
[03:02:36.960 --> 03:02:41.920]  into the district and they were upset worried worried about environmental concerns and these
[03:02:41.920 --> 03:02:48.160]  were a lot of these were government retirees so they had uh you know very well educated people
[03:02:48.160 --> 03:02:52.480]  and they had been doing their homework and as a republican nominee they wanted to know where
[03:02:52.480 --> 03:02:58.640]  i would stand on this issue and so they started to describe to me what their research had turned up
[03:02:59.360 --> 03:03:06.080]  and uh they told me that their research had turned up that obama had given the um uh
[03:03:06.080 --> 03:03:14.880]  uh dinecore dinecore a billion dollar contract and that contract involved establishing these
[03:03:14.880 --> 03:03:22.400]  schools in uh the within two hours of uh washington dc and so they described where some
[03:03:22.400 --> 03:03:28.400]  of these schools were set up and coming they're coming from a completely unconscious place
[03:03:29.200 --> 03:03:35.040]  not related to what i'm thinking because i'm seeing a perimeter in my brain around washington
[03:03:35.040 --> 03:03:42.960]  dc of private contractors uh fast forward to that mid-summer uh at my booth in my local
[03:03:42.960 --> 03:03:48.240]  hometown where i had my you know the republican party had a booth set up and i didn't realize
[03:03:48.240 --> 03:03:56.560]  so later that this person was spying on me um this person was wearing a um uh black water
[03:03:56.560 --> 03:04:03.120]  t-shirt long story short um she'd been sitting behind her booth for hours i was i was really
[03:04:03.120 --> 03:04:08.560]  unconscious not not expecting such a thing and so i asked him if i could bring some water to him he
[03:04:08.560 --> 03:04:14.320]  had a little dog we're almost out of time get almost out of time yeah i i said oh you're with
[03:04:14.320 --> 03:04:20.960]  black water and and uh so i engaged him in conversation and i talked about ogara in west
[03:04:20.960 --> 03:04:27.040]  moorland county like i as a not a question but a statement saying so you're setting up a perimeter
[03:04:27.040 --> 03:04:34.800]  around washington dc uh what what's that for you said well it's worse situation that our
[03:04:34.800 --> 03:04:39.680]  military won't be able to handle well we certainly know that they're preparing for a lot of different
[03:04:39.680 --> 03:04:44.480]  things as uh those who watch us know we went through the the place where they're preparing
[03:04:44.480 --> 03:04:49.360]  in virginia as well as another one that they've got in uh north carolina they're preparing for
[03:04:49.360 --> 03:04:53.760]  civil unrest and for martial law and that's a good point they may be deliberately trying to
[03:04:53.760 --> 03:04:59.360]  revoke veterans with this trade that's it for today thank you for joining us join us tomorrow at 11 central
