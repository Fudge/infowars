[00:20.760 --> 00:33.640]  well this is a maiden voyage first time I've done the Sunday radio show that I've
[00:33.640 --> 00:38.160]  been now doing for two years it was like I started it yesterday from four to six
[00:38.160 --> 00:44.320]  p.m. central time this is our maiden voyage out of my own studios I do the
[00:44.320 --> 00:48.960]  weekday show out of the central Texas Command Center here in Austin Texas for
[00:48.960 --> 00:54.840]  the last two years I've been doing the show out of the MS communications local
[00:54.840 --> 01:01.000]  news radio 590 studio and we're still on that fine station 590 a.m. KLBJ here in
[01:01.000 --> 01:09.240]  town but I wanted to be able to have the Sunday radio show also be simulcast over
[01:09.240 --> 01:14.040]  the web visually as a three-dimensional television show at
[01:14.040 --> 01:19.720]  prison planet dot TV so we are simulcasting right now prison planet
[01:19.720 --> 01:26.880]  dot TV we are live it is Sunday the 12th day of July 2009 we have two hours
[01:26.880 --> 01:35.560]  spanning out before us very important radio TV show today so I want to thank
[01:35.560 --> 01:43.880]  everyone that has joined us I've talked about in the past how every year or so
[01:43.880 --> 01:48.920]  I would see some government document or government textbook or
[01:48.920 --> 01:54.960]  report that stunned me that shook me to my very core and just validated and
[01:54.960 --> 02:03.080]  confirmed hundreds of other research points that I had been working on but
[02:03.080 --> 02:11.280]  Friday I became aware Friday evening of a government textbook a government
[02:11.280 --> 02:19.440]  textbook at policy level for academics advising government that's over a
[02:19.440 --> 02:26.840]  thousand pages long and I read several hundred pages of it Paul Watson wrote a
[02:26.840 --> 02:39.560]  detailed story Saturday concerning it and it validates 100% everything that
[02:39.560 --> 02:45.200]  we discussed on this radio show but then the term 110% comes into play how
[02:45.200 --> 02:54.560]  about 200% 300% 400% 500% 1000% I am almost speechless at what we've
[02:54.560 --> 03:01.320]  discovered and it's probably the most devastating single document that I have
[03:01.320 --> 03:09.240]  ever read or looked at and I can't put it down I can't put it down it it to give
[03:09.240 --> 03:13.560]  an idea it's totally changing the course of this new Obama film I was making
[03:13.560 --> 03:19.680]  that already had some information on eugenics but not much to where I'm
[03:19.680 --> 03:27.640]  just scrapping large portions of it in changing directions now it makes in game
[03:27.640 --> 03:32.880]  as horrifying and unbelievable as in game is but all well documented look
[03:32.880 --> 03:46.960]  like it's a whitewash I mean goodnight nurse when does this end what am I
[03:46.960 --> 03:51.720]  talking about I'm talking about this bastard right here on the screen John
[03:51.720 --> 03:56.920]  Holdren you see that photograph you see what's in the background you see that
[03:56.920 --> 04:06.080]  book on the bookshelf right there well I have the Google books copy of it and I
[04:06.080 --> 04:10.280]  have two ordered it's an expensive textbook I ordered a new one over a
[04:10.280 --> 04:13.920]  hundred bucks being mailed to me this son of a bitch and that's what he is
[04:13.920 --> 04:21.760]  this psychopath who makes Jeffrey Dahmer look like a choir boy this guy
[04:21.760 --> 04:29.960]  right here is one of the main engineers of the eugenics operations going on
[04:29.960 --> 04:37.680]  right now and that book you see right there on screen is everything they're
[04:37.680 --> 04:42.960]  doing to us I went lift weights today and I saw two young women who had brain
[04:42.960 --> 04:46.600]  disorders and couldn't walk and I couldn't control myself and went up and
[04:46.600 --> 04:49.640]  talked to one of them and he was talking about yeah this just suddenly happened
[04:49.640 --> 04:53.480]  when I was 22 years old out of the blue they don't know what it is and I said
[04:53.480 --> 04:57.440]  lady did you take some vaccines around that time

[06:24.000 --> 06:31.680]  two hours laying out for us here today it is Sunday July 12th 2009 and I'd like
[06:31.680 --> 06:38.080]  to thank all of you for joining us today I've been a simulcasting the radio show
[06:38.080 --> 06:43.320]  the weekday show from 11 to 3 central standard time for the last two years at
[06:43.320 --> 06:48.760]  prisonplanet.tv but I've decided to go ahead and move the Sunday show into our
[06:48.760 --> 06:52.760]  studios as well and we are simulcasting this radio show right now in living
[06:52.760 --> 06:57.280]  color at prisonplanet.tv and you'll want to go over to prisonplanet.tv and
[06:57.280 --> 07:02.400]  watch because this is gonna be one of the most important two hours of radio I
[07:02.400 --> 07:11.160]  have ever done in my 14 years on air there have been many stories that stun
[07:11.160 --> 07:18.120]  me that that that that stagger even my belief system that make me even
[07:18.120 --> 07:21.800]  question what I'm looking at and they're generally government documents
[07:21.800 --> 07:27.200]  council on fine relations documents declassified documents one of them is
[07:27.200 --> 07:32.960]  operation north woods in April of 2000 the Baltimore Sun the associated press
[07:32.960 --> 07:39.680]  and ABC news all did front page top coverage ABC nightly news covered it
[07:39.680 --> 07:45.720]  headline US government plan to bomb and terrorize US cities as pretext to attack
[07:45.720 --> 07:50.480]  Cuba war with the Soviet Union and it was declassified the government admitted
[07:50.480 --> 07:55.040]  that they had a plan to stage terror attacks across America as a pretext to
[07:55.040 --> 08:01.120]  launch World War three but thank god president John F. Kennedy had said no so
[08:01.120 --> 08:10.720]  general L. L. Lemonser and the boys had him capped now the information I
[08:10.720 --> 08:20.320]  discovered Friday into Saturday that's up on prisonplanet.com stunned me so
[08:20.320 --> 08:28.400]  badly and it dwarfs any other discovery anything else I've ever covered
[08:28.400 --> 08:36.400]  nothing even begins to approach the level and the magnitude of the
[08:36.400 --> 08:42.560]  information you're about to hear today now that said we did not discover this
[08:42.560 --> 08:48.520]  information it turns out front page magazine run by David Horro it's a big
[08:48.520 --> 08:55.080]  neocon pro war guide found the textbook and wrote a story weeks ago and it got
[08:55.080 --> 09:02.400]  no attention then some other big blogs went and bought the the the government
[09:02.400 --> 09:09.800]  textbook and did scans of it and then Paul Watson discovered Friday that about
[09:09.800 --> 09:13.480]  half the book is on Google books and then you can also find part of the book on
[09:13.480 --> 09:16.560]  Amazon and if you look around enough places you can find the whole book
[09:16.560 --> 09:21.000]  online I ordered two of these a new one and a used one the used ones are 60
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.440]  something bucks new is hundreds of dollars government textbook and it's a
[09:25.440 --> 09:29.840]  textbook out of print this is a textbook though for policy people this is a
[09:29.840 --> 09:34.800]  textbook for PhDs and academia kind of like Carol Quigley's tragedy and hope
[09:34.800 --> 09:41.400]  also 1100 pages this treatise is 1100 and tragedy and hope was commissioned
[09:41.400 --> 09:45.840]  by the State Department the CIA they were to print a thousand copies he was
[09:45.840 --> 09:49.360]  led into the official histories of the British Empire how it had taken over the
[09:49.360 --> 09:53.720]  US with the Federal Reserve Act how they controlled fascist and communist how
[09:53.720 --> 09:57.320]  they funded Hitler how they funded Stalin and he just brags about it all
[09:57.320 --> 10:03.320]  and that's Bill Clinton's main mentor from Georgetown and it's thousands of
[10:03.320 --> 10:07.400]  dollars to get an original of one of those though other groups have pirated
[10:07.400 --> 10:11.680]  it and republished it and you can do that with government funded manuscripts so
[10:11.680 --> 10:20.200]  you can get a copy of tragedy and hope out there if you'd like to now this
[10:20.200 --> 10:27.600]  textbook dwarfs that and everything that Carol Quigley in 68 when he published
[10:27.600 --> 10:31.480]  that book has become somewhat passé we got Al Gore calling for world government
[10:31.480 --> 10:34.920]  we've got the Canadian Prime Minister calling for world government last week
[10:34.920 --> 10:38.080]  we have the Pope last week we're gonna play those clips calling for a new world
[10:38.080 --> 10:46.360]  order world planetary government that you pay carbon taxes to rat singer Benedict
[10:46.360 --> 10:51.880]  the whatever he is but the point is all of this is going on and happening right
[10:51.880 --> 10:55.840]  now and so all these years we told you about that and oh we're kooks oh we're
[10:55.840 --> 10:59.520]  crazy and I'm like hey look at these government documents and look at these
[10:59.520 --> 11:02.640]  ran corporation documents and look at this congressional hearing about it and
[11:02.640 --> 11:06.200]  you'd laugh oh that doesn't exist well now you see all over the news admitting a
[11:06.200 --> 11:09.640]  world government well you better listen to what I'm telling you right now
[11:09.640 --> 11:13.560]  because if you like having a stroke when you're 15 you like having heart
[11:13.560 --> 11:18.400]  attacks at 25 if you like that millions of people are getting early on set of
[11:18.400 --> 11:23.280]  what they call brain disorders that they're calling you know juvenile and
[11:23.280 --> 11:27.280]  and other forms of Alzheimer's now I mean if you like the fact that kids are
[11:27.280 --> 11:30.880]  dying to your left and dying to your right and the juvenile cancers are
[11:30.880 --> 11:36.880]  exploding by over 3,000% on average if you liked it in the 1950s one out of 33
[11:36.880 --> 11:40.880]  out of cancer now it's one out of three if you like that everywhere you go
[11:40.880 --> 11:46.600]  people are just devastated I mean it's all spelled out by this bastard I mean
[11:46.600 --> 11:50.120]  you might want to read how they're killing you I mean I'm risking my life to
[11:50.120 --> 11:54.680]  tell you this but I was thinking about it today I said I don't even care if they
[11:54.680 --> 11:58.400]  kill me I want to keep living but the point is how could you not fight
[11:58.400 --> 12:02.720]  something this big fight something this bad look I'm right about this this is
[12:02.720 --> 12:07.200]  real even if you don't want to believe it and you want to laugh at it now we
[12:07.200 --> 12:12.520]  have hundreds of pages of this textbook scanned and posted at prisonplanet.com

[19:08.480 --> 19:12.720]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar wants to control how
[19:12.720 --> 19:16.960]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[19:16.960 --> 19:20.960]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[19:20.960 --> 19:24.840]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[19:24.840 --> 19:28.480]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane
[19:28.480 --> 19:31.800]  and dangerous summer storm season is here again every year thousands of
[19:31.800 --> 19:35.720]  families lose their power from weather related outages number five a solar
[19:35.720 --> 19:39.560]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I

[20:21.920 --> 20:25.520]  compounds to sterilize you in the water they're gonna sterilize you with
[20:25.520 --> 20:29.120]  vaccines they're gonna have forced abortions and infanticide they're gonna
[20:29.120 --> 20:36.000]  kill your baby because they're really Nazis it has nothing to do with the
[20:36.000 --> 20:40.880]  environmental movement we're gonna break that down now let me set the table
[20:40.880 --> 20:46.000]  before I plunge into this if you're listening to us on AM FM shortwave
[20:46.000 --> 20:50.800]  satellite internet however you're listening call your friends your family
[20:50.800 --> 20:55.200]  your neighbors and tell them to tune in to that local station or tell them to
[20:55.200 --> 21:00.880]  listen on the web and info wars.com or GCN live.com or prisonplanet.tv
[21:00.880 --> 21:07.360]  whatever you do this is important information not Michael Jackson second
[21:07.360 --> 21:15.080]  biggest story of the century after Obama being elected I mean this is sick the
[21:15.080 --> 21:20.360]  biggest story of this century should be over a million plus dead Iraqis from the
[21:20.360 --> 21:24.960]  so-called liberation but again if you're watching us at prisonplanet.tv you
[21:24.960 --> 21:29.800]  can see all these documents put the book the textbook back up on screen for
[21:29.800 --> 21:35.480]  everybody that's watching and remember that when I talk about this this is not
[21:35.480 --> 21:42.160]  just one government textbook this is not just one publication for academics
[21:42.440 --> 21:49.000]  this is the most important point to this remember dr. Eric Pionka three years
[21:49.000 --> 21:52.720]  ago it's in my film in game blueprint for global enslavement he goes on
[21:52.720 --> 21:57.600]  national TV and says I think we should kill 90% of the public with an airborne
[21:57.600 --> 22:03.040]  Ebola then he goes to the Texas Academy of Sciences and wins the first place
[22:03.040 --> 22:09.040]  award and the news reports he gets a standing ovation and I had the reporters
[22:09.040 --> 22:15.480]  on they said over 90% of the crowd crying and cheering for over three minutes
[22:15.480 --> 22:20.720]  this was in the two Texas newspapers then he went to st. Edwards here in Austin
[22:20.720 --> 22:25.600]  got another round of standing ovation when on the PowerPoint one of the heads
[22:25.600 --> 22:31.800]  of the biology department at UT dr. Eric Pionka projects a PowerPoint of human
[22:31.800 --> 22:38.320]  skulls blown up on the wall 30 feet high and says we need to kill 90% of the
[22:38.320 --> 22:45.760]  public they start crying and rapture this is a death cult the issue is 90 well one
[22:45.760 --> 22:49.560]  reporter on the show when I talked to him said 95% got up and clapped he said
[22:49.560 --> 22:54.640]  almost everybody and here's the big issue it isn't just the president's top
[22:54.640 --> 22:59.400]  science advisor when you go to any of these big universities any biology
[22:59.400 --> 23:06.480]  department any psychology department just randomly pick the head of your
[23:06.480 --> 23:09.880]  psychology department or the head of your biology department Google their name
[23:09.880 --> 23:14.400]  under eugenics or under forced sterilization and I would say because
[23:14.400 --> 23:18.320]  I've done this over 90% of the time 9 times out of 10 they are going to be for
[23:18.320 --> 23:22.600]  exterminating 80% of the population at least some say 90 when I started
[23:22.600 --> 23:30.480]  criticizing dr. Eric Pionka I got threatening phone calls and emails and
[23:30.480 --> 23:34.400]  I even posted a photo of one of his students hugging him one of his graduate
[23:34.400 --> 23:36.640]  students and she sent me a threatening email saying don't put me on your
[23:36.640 --> 23:41.680]  website even that was in a newspaper and then I looked at her name and went and
[23:41.680 --> 23:45.000]  looked up her graduate papers and then I went looked up other graduate papers
[23:45.000 --> 23:49.840]  under Pionka and they were saying stuff like Pionka is not radical enough we
[23:49.840 --> 23:55.360]  must kill all humans homo sapiens sapien is a cancer and a parasite and bad and
[23:55.360 --> 23:59.680]  we must kill all humans and then I had them sending me their graduate papers
[23:59.680 --> 24:04.480]  yelling I'm a doctor of biology working at this and I assure you he's a very great
[24:04.480 --> 24:09.800]  man and taught me 15 years ago and then we need to get rid of almost all humans
[24:09.800 --> 24:17.400]  and only keep a few thousand folks this is the majority this is the norm my
[24:17.400 --> 24:23.160]  father at the University of Texas top of his class in the 1960s was they
[24:23.160 --> 24:28.680]  attempted to recruit him he never even told me about this till he saw in game
[24:28.680 --> 24:32.200]  and my mother was saying it can't be true it can he said no honey they actually
[24:32.200 --> 24:35.960]  tried to recruit me the head of the botany department tried to recruit him
[24:35.960 --> 24:48.560]  in to a movement for your old government and to carry out eugenics so when I go
[24:48.560 --> 24:52.520]  over how they're putting poison in the water right now it's happening right now
[24:52.520 --> 24:56.400]  they're killing us right now with soft kill weapons and I'll define soft kill
[24:56.400 --> 25:02.160]  for you you're being sterilized right now you're having heavy metals put into
[25:02.160 --> 25:07.240]  your brain tissue right now you're being shot up with cancer viruses right now
[25:07.240 --> 25:12.320]  understand that if you will just go read his book and read the other government
[25:12.320 --> 25:18.240]  textbooks that you will see this and that it is hard to find one of these
[25:18.240 --> 25:23.360]  people that is into this they are a cult of control freaks they love the fact
[25:23.360 --> 25:26.360]  that they're in all the positions of power and that they're doing this and
[25:26.360 --> 25:30.480]  they write books laughing at how you don't care and aren't involved and so
[25:30.480 --> 25:35.160]  that's how evidence through social Darwinism shows that you don't care so
[25:35.160 --> 25:43.120]  you deserve to die now listen to me carefully this is not shock radio this
[25:43.120 --> 25:49.680]  is shocking reality Hitler was real what he did he was only a side group he was
[25:49.680 --> 25:58.560]  only one small small small poquito branch a mini branch of this larger system of
[25:58.560 --> 26:06.840]  crypto eugenics now remember this article I made a big deal out of we're gonna
[26:06.840 --> 26:13.160]  play a clip coming up later of US news ABC news said oh well billionaires the
[26:13.160 --> 26:16.120]  richest in the world met to help humanity but wouldn't say what the secret
[26:16.120 --> 26:20.480]  meeting was but then the organizer of the meeting talked to the times of
[26:20.480 --> 26:26.480]  London and said well the British are ready to hear this we met to discuss how
[26:26.480 --> 26:31.520]  to reduce the world population through a world government here's the times of
[26:31.520 --> 26:35.440]  London this is as big as the New York Times worldwide this is one of the
[26:35.440 --> 26:42.280]  biggest newspapers it's in the top three worldwide and the headline is
[26:42.280 --> 26:47.880]  billionaire club in bid to curb overpopulation America's richest people
[26:47.880 --> 26:51.560]  meant to discuss ways of tackling a disastrous environmental social and
[26:51.560 --> 26:55.120]  industrial threat see they're the heroes they're the savers of the world
[26:55.120 --> 27:01.760]  this is how they phrase it this is how they pose it but not only are these
[27:01.760 --> 27:10.360]  people madmen not only are they wanting to kill the majority of us but but they
[27:10.360 --> 27:14.440]  in their internal documents that are declassified like the Royal Commission on
[27:14.440 --> 27:19.240]  population 1949 state it's not even really about saving the earth that's
[27:19.240 --> 27:26.360]  their excuse to academia to carry out a program of mass extermination and they
[27:26.360 --> 27:30.480]  say with our nanotech and our genetic engineering even by the 60s we can kill
[27:30.480 --> 27:33.000]  the earth repeatedly and just regenerate it that's why they've created
[27:33.000 --> 27:39.000]  seed vaults human arcs animal arcs of the DNA and they admit that they're
[27:39.000 --> 27:43.600]  actually geoengineering plagues in the final phase that will wipe out most of
[27:43.600 --> 27:47.160]  the surface growth on the planet most species they're not worried they're so
[27:47.160 --> 27:51.320]  delusional and so nihilistic they say they're gonna rebuild the planet so all
[27:51.320 --> 27:54.640]  you environmentalist out there that kind of go well we there are too many
[27:54.640 --> 27:59.480]  people it's a tough decision but you've kind of received the common knowledge the
[27:59.480 --> 28:04.040]  open secret that well I guess we do have to get rid of people they're getting
[28:04.040 --> 28:08.000]  rid of you stupid that's why you can't have kids that's why you're dying of
[28:08.000 --> 28:15.200]  cancer at 45 they're killing you dummy you're not part of the elite there are a
[28:15.200 --> 28:17.840]  lot of racist email me and say yeah we gotta get rid of the blacks and
[28:17.840 --> 28:22.000]  Hispanics and Asians they outnumber us hey dummies even if you're a racist and
[28:22.000 --> 28:28.000]  stupid the elites are actually targeting you more than their the elites over and
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.160]  over again in these eugenics documents we're gonna get into them coming up say

[33:41.080 --> 33:47.720]  that is a wide area to discuss state of our memorandum 200 written in 1973 says
[33:47.720 --> 33:52.240]  the official U.S. government policy is to start wars create famines pay
[33:52.240 --> 33:56.760]  governments to forcibly sterilize their women to reduce world population so when
[33:56.760 --> 34:01.680]  you talk about war it's about killing people period official declassified in
[34:01.680 --> 34:09.920]  1992 written in 1973 so when we talk about the GMO food which just so happens
[34:09.920 --> 34:13.320]  to always sterilize the different rodents they tested on and then it always
[34:13.320 --> 34:18.280]  gets approval they know what they're doing when we talk about an 87% reduction
[34:18.280 --> 34:23.240]  in U.S. and European sperm count and even the ones that men have don't have
[34:23.240 --> 34:29.400]  tails and can hardly swim it's because it's done by design these are weaponized
[34:29.400 --> 34:35.480]  food crops on record I've had top geneticist and engineers on we have the
[34:35.480 --> 34:40.400]  declassified government documents with the Australians in the 50s that's in my
[34:40.400 --> 34:45.480]  film wrote a tyranny made 2002 the age newspaper their big newspaper admitted
[34:45.480 --> 34:49.680]  sterilizing the average and he's putting stuff in their water this is going on
[34:49.680 --> 34:55.760]  right now right now that's why your public service announcements and doctors
[34:55.760 --> 34:59.440]  that are on the radio all these shows going drink your tap water don't drink
[34:59.440 --> 35:04.720]  bottle don't filter it trust the government please drink the waters but
[35:04.720 --> 35:08.720]  don't filter the stuff you bathe in let your children absorb that we're putting
[35:08.720 --> 35:13.960]  special nutrients in there to help you but the public just doesn't believe them
[35:13.960 --> 35:19.640]  at a gut level you know well I could go on for hours with background evidence
[35:19.640 --> 35:26.680]  and information why was I staggered stunned Friday into Saturday well I
[35:26.680 --> 35:31.880]  saw a front page magazine story that's a contributor to Fox David Horowitz and
[35:31.880 --> 35:35.520]  then I went and Horowitz didn't give any photos or documents of the book so I
[35:35.520 --> 35:39.080]  started looking for the book and sure enough Watson simultaneously seen it
[35:39.080 --> 35:44.640]  he wrote a big story about it at prison planet dot com with the screenshots some
[35:44.640 --> 35:50.800]  other sites picked it up did a great job John Holdren Obama science ours has
[35:50.800 --> 35:55.320]  forced abortions and masterization needed to save the planet book he
[35:55.320 --> 36:00.280]  authored which is actually a policy textbook is for policy level advocates
[36:00.280 --> 36:04.720]  for extreme to talentarian measures to control the population now see what a
[36:04.720 --> 36:09.360]  dr. Eric Pionka in his books in his public statements at UT say it's all
[36:09.360 --> 36:13.360]  the same he said we need a worldwide police state like China to carry out
[36:13.360 --> 36:17.640]  forced sterilization and reduction of the population and what would be ideal
[36:17.640 --> 36:23.120]  would be an airborne Ebola to kill at least 90% and then his students like
[36:23.120 --> 36:27.120]  piranhas attacked me when I criticized him and said kill all humans this is on
[36:27.120 --> 36:34.600]  record folks just Google PhD paper on population control you'll get millions of
[36:34.600 --> 36:39.440]  hits because these little bastards these little PhDs are proud of themselves that
[36:39.440 --> 36:45.480]  I mean your your your neck deep in them this is the norm what you're about to
[36:45.480 --> 36:49.560]  hear but but but why this hit me so hard is this is the head science advisor
[36:49.560 --> 36:53.360]  over all the science programs of the federal government and hence a UN
[36:53.360 --> 36:59.240]  funding by extension IMF and World Bank operations it's all unified and I read
[36:59.240 --> 37:04.880]  hundreds of pages of the book what is online at Google and Amazon they have
[37:04.880 --> 37:09.160]  large sections of it at universities posted screenshots I've got again two of
[37:09.160 --> 37:13.120]  the books a new one and a used one on the way to me ordered at Amazon since we
[37:13.120 --> 37:18.160]  posted a link to it it's it's sold out on Amazon because it's only a used book
[37:18.160 --> 37:25.360]  John P. Holdren and then you look at the other authors of the other two authors
[37:25.360 --> 37:29.480]  they're both calling for world government same crap in public speeches
[37:29.480 --> 37:35.280]  today now the reason this is so important is he's now come out and calling for
[37:35.280 --> 37:39.480]  similar things and he wants the global carbon tax which they admit is about
[37:39.480 --> 37:43.440]  starving you getting the country in debt the world in debt and then
[37:43.440 --> 37:47.040]  artificially restricting resources to where you can't even afford to have
[37:47.040 --> 37:52.080]  children but but let's go through what he calls for women could be forced to
[37:52.080 --> 37:56.280]  abort their pregnancies whether they wanted to or not the population at
[37:56.280 --> 37:59.840]  large would be sterilized by infertility drugs intentionally put the
[37:59.840 --> 38:03.280]  nation's drinking water and in the food and they talk about how to do it and
[38:03.280 --> 38:06.800]  they've already now been caught in Africa in Latin America in Asia in
[38:06.800 --> 38:11.360]  Australia doing this see when I read this book probably 250 pages I've read in
[38:11.360 --> 38:17.640]  the last few days because I'm reading it slowly every paragraph is everything
[38:17.640 --> 38:23.240]  already new see we had about 80% of the pieces the biological UN diversity
[38:23.240 --> 38:27.920]  assessments the Rand Corporation the Council on Foreign Relations reports on
[38:27.920 --> 38:34.640]  this books written by the Queen Elizabeth's husband the Duke of
[38:34.640 --> 38:39.400]  Edinburgh Prince Philip books by Prince Charles you know hundreds of
[38:39.400 --> 38:42.960]  publications university statements government programs but when they do it
[38:42.960 --> 38:46.160]  as a government program they then don't list everything it's just these you
[38:46.160 --> 38:50.480]  Genesis run the program and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with
[38:50.480 --> 38:55.400]  special vaccines and AIDS vaccine for everybody in Africa which then in the
[38:55.400 --> 39:02.400]  trials happens to sterilize you or bird flu being mixed with vaccine trials in
[39:02.400 --> 39:06.440]  Europe and suddenly people dying in mass and giving it to the poor and
[39:06.440 --> 39:09.160]  suddenly they all die in fact people don't believe that just Google
[39:09.160 --> 39:15.640]  homeless dying bird flu trials just dying in mass or how people are dying in
[39:15.640 --> 39:20.240]  mass from the Gardasil and then when it comes out the Gardasil's killing people
[39:20.240 --> 39:24.800]  it's in mainstream news Merck plan to send out hit teams like pull that up
[39:24.800 --> 39:29.800]  next or they won't believe that too about the Merck hit teams Merck plan to
[39:29.800 --> 39:36.880]  quote liquidate doctors that criticize them now because see this is all good
[39:36.880 --> 39:40.440]  according to them that's why it came out with Bayer pharmaceutical they ship
[39:40.440 --> 39:47.080]  out over a million ampoules of factor 8 full of HIV and hepatitis B and C
[39:47.080 --> 39:50.920]  knowing what it would do and it came out in legal documents even MSNBC covered
[39:50.920 --> 39:55.960]  it you can just Google on YouTube factor 8 Bayer you'll watch the newscast where
[39:55.960 --> 40:01.040]  they knowingly put it in there and then ship that out when they knew because
[40:01.040 --> 40:06.360]  they but it's their religion to kill you
[40:06.360 --> 40:11.720]  London telegraph homeless people died for bird flu vaccine trial in Poland and
[40:11.720 --> 40:15.720]  they died in mass go read it folks you cannot make up the magnitude and how
[40:15.720 --> 40:19.520]  serious this is I can't believe I'm the big radio host and the guy with the
[40:19.520 --> 40:24.360]  giant sites fighting this I can't believe it's me why am I the one fighting it
[40:24.360 --> 40:28.280]  why am I the one that sees it the yuppies are too self-assured too arrogant
[40:28.280 --> 40:32.280]  too haughty to oh yeah sure and they wonder why their little kids dying of
[40:32.280 --> 40:37.360]  cancer at age nine listen your football doesn't matter your acting cool doesn't
[40:37.360 --> 40:41.720]  matter your Michael Jackson dying doesn't matter you're being hit with chemical
[40:41.720 --> 40:47.200]  and biological weapons this Obama's head of science also it called an AP and
[40:47.200 --> 40:51.400]  Reuters for chem trailing and spraying the atmosphere quote to save the
[40:51.400 --> 40:54.800]  environment and it just so happens these chem trails they denied all these years
[40:54.800 --> 40:57.920]  and they now admit on the front page of the Wall Street Journal saying it'll
[40:57.920 --> 41:07.000]  save the earth and in Atlantic monthly they call for it in the July August issue
[41:07.000 --> 41:11.720]  I'm not even looking for this stuff he's on the news in AP and Reuters and
[41:11.720 --> 41:20.000]  Atlantic monthly and Wall Street Journal and everywhere else calling for
[41:20.000 --> 41:23.680]  blimps and aircraft spraying and that's exactly what we said they were already
[41:23.680 --> 41:27.520]  doing they admit oh those were just test barium salts aluminum and oxide
[41:27.520 --> 41:31.720]  that causes Alzheimer's and sterilization and a bunch of other

[45:01.800 --> 45:05.440]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this
[45:05.440 --> 45:08.800]  summer number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[45:08.800 --> 45:12.960]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[45:12.960 --> 45:17.200]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[45:17.200 --> 45:21.200]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[45:21.200 --> 45:25.080]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[45:25.080 --> 45:28.680]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane
[45:28.680 --> 45:32.040]  and dangerous summer storm season is here again every year thousands of
[45:32.040 --> 45:36.000]  families lose their power from weather related outages number five a solar
[45:36.000 --> 45:39.800]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[45:39.800 --> 45:42.920]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[45:42.920 --> 45:49.640]  science a longtime sponsor of ours you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[47:20.160 --> 47:27.400]  only on eugenics are you 25 they already told you have Alzheimer's you go get
[47:27.400 --> 47:32.200]  a cat scan your brain is full of aluminum and mercury from the vaccines and
[47:32.200 --> 47:35.800]  from what's put in the air and water what's sprayed by the government
[47:35.800 --> 47:40.240]  aircraft on record now wall street journal Atlantic monthly I mean look at
[47:40.240 --> 47:44.680]  Atlantic monthly they have this big giant chemtrail story in here and they
[47:44.680 --> 47:47.640]  have a debate they go oh the government's been doing test of spraying us
[47:47.640 --> 47:53.000]  with chemtrails is you know is that a good idea I'll go over that story later
[47:53.000 --> 47:57.120]  in the next hour the point is that I don't make any of this up no matter how
[47:57.120 --> 48:02.200]  crazy it sounds this is out of the Australian dot news dot co dot au one
[48:02.200 --> 48:07.240]  of their biggest newspapers the Australian Vioxx maker Merck and co
[48:07.240 --> 48:12.960]  drew up doctor hit list international drug company made a hit list of doctors
[48:12.960 --> 48:17.720]  who had to be neutralized or discredited because they criticized the
[48:17.720 --> 48:23.680]  anti-arthritis drug and pharmaceutical giant staff at the US company Merck and
[48:23.680 --> 48:27.360]  co emailed each other about a list of doctors mainly researchers and
[48:27.360 --> 48:30.960]  academics by the way a bunch of people did get killed but they just say in the
[48:30.960 --> 48:35.000]  court case oh we've just meant sent hit teams to their house we just use the
[48:35.000 --> 48:39.520]  term hit team meaning being friendly we didn't mean that was a figure of
[48:39.520 --> 48:43.800]  speech though a bunch of people have gotten killed so not connected to them
[48:43.800 --> 48:49.680]  they're very nice people it goes on a staff at the US company Merck and co
[48:49.680 --> 48:53.000]  emailed each other about the list of doctors mainly researchers and
[48:53.000 --> 48:58.160]  academics who had been negative about the drug Vioxx or Merck and a
[48:58.160 --> 49:03.640]  recommended course of action we may need to seek out and destroy them where
[49:03.640 --> 49:10.160]  they live quote a Merck employee wrote according to an email excerpt from the
[49:10.160 --> 49:16.400]  court case and it goes on if you want to read that so I have a problem I tend to
[49:16.400 --> 49:20.680]  get up here on air and then make a statement and then want to document it
[49:20.680 --> 49:25.480]  for you and then and then we kind of get stuck on that point and when it's not
[49:25.480 --> 49:33.200]  really the main point John Holdren Obama science are says forced abortions and
[49:33.200 --> 49:38.640]  master realizations need to be need to be done to save the planet now if you go
[49:38.640 --> 49:44.600]  to prisonplanet.com or info wars.com and click on this master article written
[49:44.600 --> 49:51.320]  by Paul Joseph Watson the article itself is 18 pages long this article is 18
[49:51.320 --> 49:57.440]  pages long and in this article we have screenshots of dozens and dozens and
[49:57.440 --> 50:04.280]  dozens of the key pages from the book these are scans of the academic textbook
[50:04.280 --> 50:14.040]  this is a above PhD textbook for government and we have screenshots of the
[50:14.040 --> 50:21.320]  front of the textbook and the key pages where this guy calls for women to be
[50:21.320 --> 50:25.800]  forced to abort their pregnancies inside the U.S. whether they wanted to or
[50:25.800 --> 50:31.560]  not the population at large needs to be sterilized by infertility drugs
[50:31.560 --> 50:36.320]  intentionally put into the nation's drinking water and food single mothers
[50:36.320 --> 50:40.120]  and teen mothers should have their baby sees from them against their will and
[50:40.120 --> 50:45.880]  given away to other couples to raise CCPS was set up by eugenesis groups 89
[50:45.880 --> 50:51.520]  years ago 90 years ago but about a hundred years ago in England the family
[50:51.520 --> 50:54.840]  courts that's why they're outside of judge jury that's why they're outside of
[50:54.840 --> 51:00.040]  due process it's a racial hygiene court so they were called in the U.S. people who
[51:00.040 --> 51:06.280]  contribute to social deterioration can be required by law to exercise
[51:06.280 --> 51:09.600]  reproductive responsibility in other words be compelled to have abortions or
[51:09.600 --> 51:15.960]  be sterilized a transnational planetary regime should assume control of the
[51:15.960 --> 51:21.240]  global economy and also dictate the most intimate details of Americans lives
[51:21.240 --> 51:25.920]  using an armed international police force and it goes on now I'm going to go
[51:25.920 --> 51:34.320]  through the actual quotes coming up after we take calls the next hour but I
[51:34.320 --> 51:39.200]  want you to understand that all of this is being implemented and this is the
[51:39.200 --> 51:47.560]  textbook created by the man who heads up the federal government's science
[51:47.560 --> 51:56.800]  operations this is for real forced abortions master elization of planetary
[51:56.800 --> 52:00.200]  regime world government with the power of life and death over American citizens
[52:00.200 --> 52:04.720]  the tyrannical fantasies of a madman or merely the opinions of the person now
[52:04.720 --> 52:12.080]  in control of the science policy of the United States now you can go read
[52:12.080 --> 52:17.040]  ecoscience at prison planet dot com and info wars dot com right now you can go
[52:17.040 --> 52:23.320]  see this for yourself but understand that don't stop there randomly pick the
[52:23.320 --> 52:29.480]  head of the psychology department at your local university randomly pick the
[52:29.480 --> 52:33.440]  head of biology at your local university randomly pick the head of the
[52:33.440 --> 52:40.400]  state psychiatry board randomly pick the head of the water board and go look in
[52:40.400 --> 52:47.200]  nine times out of ten they are going to be a public eugenicist ladies and
[52:47.200 --> 52:53.200]  gentlemen they run almost everything and now they're calling for George mom
[52:53.200 --> 52:59.080]  biot big writer London Guardian was in a big story a couple months ago where
[52:59.080 --> 53:02.960]  hundreds of top journalists called for a planetary government to carry out the
[53:02.960 --> 53:10.280]  green carbon taxes and population reduction and mom biot came out Friday
[53:10.280 --> 53:14.280]  with an article we covered and said I want to restrict all free speech and
[53:14.280 --> 53:18.760]  have government certification of blogs Nancy Pelosi's been calling for that the
[53:18.760 --> 53:21.680]  federal government's been calling for that a fairness doctrine not just over
[53:21.680 --> 53:26.320]  talk radio but the internet where you're not allowed to criticize planetary
[53:26.320 --> 53:30.200]  warming and you can't say the sun's causing it they're actually calling for
[53:30.200 --> 53:34.880]  that to be a form of hate speech and the house has passed the Senate's set to
[53:34.880 --> 53:38.920]  pass the hate crimes law saying that they can basically list whatever they
[53:38.920 --> 53:43.640]  want is illegal same thing with the cyber bullying act it's all happening
[53:43.640 --> 53:48.600]  these people mean business now you may be a control freak you may see yourself as
[53:48.600 --> 53:52.240]  an elitist but you're drinking the sodium fluoride water and that's only
[53:52.240 --> 53:55.720]  one of hundreds of chemicals they put in that's known to sterilize and brain
[53:55.720 --> 54:00.560]  damage you are taking vaccines full of all of this garbage put in there by
[54:00.560 --> 54:04.000]  design of the cancer viruses that have been found in every major vaccine we've
[54:04.000 --> 54:09.440]  got dr. sock and others bragging how it gave 98 million Americans cancer just in
[54:09.440 --> 54:14.600]  the first round of polio shots that's a US government report would you like me
[54:14.600 --> 54:17.680]  to pull it up maybe during the five minute news break I can find that and
[54:17.680 --> 54:21.280]  pull up dr. sock saying that on video and laughing about it or pull up the
[54:21.280 --> 54:26.520]  government report 98 million now you may think 98 million of you since the
[54:26.520 --> 54:31.160]  1950s to now a diet of this stuff's fun and cute and and great but let me tell
[54:31.160 --> 54:38.080]  you it it didn't fun to me you may think you can do the little yuppie cultural
[54:38.080 --> 54:43.160]  deadness of giggling about it but that won't get you past all this now a lot
[54:43.160 --> 54:46.360]  of you laughed about me saying they want a world government to carry out
[54:46.360 --> 54:50.440]  eugenics that's their own statement the 1996 biological diversity assessment
[54:50.440 --> 54:54.480]  official u.n. policy saying they want a world governments they can carry out the
[54:54.480 --> 54:59.080]  orderly reduction of population by 80% and there's hundreds of other documents
[54:59.080 --> 55:03.840]  in my film in game covers hundreds of those documents in game blueprint for
[55:03.840 --> 55:07.960]  global enslavement by the way do we get what is the in game dot com back up that
[55:07.960 --> 55:15.960]  sided crash it has a it's back up a full bibliography on it a full bibliography
[55:15.960 --> 55:18.400]  of the film everything foot noted if you want to go there and find out about
[55:18.400 --> 55:23.160]  eugenics that's the best play this to do it but right now before we go to break
[55:23.160 --> 55:28.240]  I want to play Al Gore three days ago before the Times of London and a press
[55:28.240 --> 55:33.640]  conference saying global government global governance will carry this out
[55:33.640 --> 55:38.640]  now I posted the video days ago because the headline wasn't about global
[55:38.640 --> 55:42.560]  government it was just in a video I posted and then drudge report picked it
[55:42.560 --> 55:47.600]  up Friday but before that I got dozens of emails or more saying I was a liar
[55:47.600 --> 55:51.920]  global governance doesn't mean government listen dumb dumbs and I'm not
[55:51.920 --> 55:55.880]  talking to my general listeners but those are in denial governance means
[55:55.880 --> 56:00.880]  government the dictionary hey I assure you that we'll pull that up later and
[56:00.880 --> 56:04.160]  put it on screen the definition of governance means government but we'll
[56:04.160 --> 56:08.120]  show that to you from Marion Webster dictionary online how's that sound for
[56:08.120 --> 56:11.680]  you because I'm not gonna have denial this is this radio shows about hardcore
[56:11.680 --> 56:18.120]  information warfare play Al Gore I assure you Al Gore exist here is Al Gore
[56:18.120 --> 56:24.880]  comes up 30 seconds from the United States within one month of taking office
[56:24.880 --> 56:34.760]  President Obama secured 80 billion dollars US for renewable energy and green
[56:34.760 --> 56:42.640]  infrastructure and then just two weeks ago the House of Representatives passed
[56:42.640 --> 56:50.360]  the Waxman Markey bill which for all of its flaws does put a price on carbon and
[56:50.360 --> 56:56.240]  is very much a step in the right direction it achieves real reductions
[56:56.240 --> 57:06.560]  below the 1990 base level by 2020 and that is the threshold that many have
[57:06.560 --> 57:13.520]  said including many in China is the threshold that will dramatically
[57:13.520 --> 57:24.280]  increase the prospects for success but it is the awareness itself that will
[57:24.280 --> 57:29.560]  drive the change and one of the ways it will drive the change is through global
[57:29.560 --> 57:34.800]  governance and global agreements but the many business leaders who have been
[57:34.800 --> 57:38.600]  all right we'll be right back are a month's easing the economy giving to
[57:38.600 --> 57:43.440]  themselves while putting poison in your water and the air they're killing us is

[59:03.120 --> 59:06.840]  present in municipal drinking water many of these chemicals are directly linked
[59:06.840 --> 59:11.080]  to cancer reproductive immune and developmental system diseases now what

[1:00:12.120 --> 1:00:19.680]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[1:00:19.680 --> 1:00:29.840]  alex jones it is july 12th on the sunday edition sunday july 12 2009 now I
[1:00:29.840 --> 1:00:36.720]  haven't even begun to get into the textbook itself and his actual quotes
[1:00:37.920 --> 1:00:42.840]  how to poison the water how to poison the food how to do it through vaccines
[1:00:42.840 --> 1:00:49.360]  and this textbook population resources environment again this is a above phd
[1:00:49.360 --> 1:00:53.800]  level this is a guy that headed up large sectors of mit headed up the
[1:00:53.800 --> 1:00:59.320]  technology and biology and science areas of harvard and now heads up obama's
[1:00:59.320 --> 1:01:04.360]  operation but it doesn't matter you go research all these science advisors you
[1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:10.120]  go research all the heads the point is this isn't just one guy who's out here
[1:01:10.120 --> 1:01:16.840]  doing government textbooks along these lines this is the accepted knowledge this
[1:01:16.840 --> 1:01:23.000]  is the on-the-record information now some stations don't carry this first five
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:26.280]  minutes that's why we have a one-minute break at five after but we're gonna go
[1:01:26.280 --> 1:01:29.440]  ahead and start taking your calls right now I'll continue with calls in the next
[1:01:29.440 --> 1:01:36.240]  segment then I want to later in the hour go through this document and then go
[1:01:36.240 --> 1:01:39.880]  through some points that I wrote up today that I separately want to make on
[1:01:39.880 --> 1:01:45.280]  air about how we should counter this how we should resist this and also
[1:01:45.280 --> 1:01:48.720]  understanding the mindset of these people why they're doing this and
[1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:52.600]  explaining to all the environmentalist out there that the Rockefellers over a
[1:01:52.600 --> 1:01:56.400]  hundred years ago created the environmental movement to demonize
[1:01:56.400 --> 1:02:02.080]  mankind to sell eugenics and they funded Hitler planned parenthood
[1:02:02.080 --> 1:02:08.360]  sterilization everything that we know of as their society today IBM the human
[1:02:08.360 --> 1:02:12.400]  genome Dick Cheney saying kill certain races with race specific bio weapons
[1:02:12.400 --> 1:02:17.440]  that was even the Austin American statesman this is all being done for a
[1:02:17.440 --> 1:02:21.040]  reason I'm gonna break down the master plan it has nothing to do with saving
[1:02:21.040 --> 1:02:25.640]  the earth and they admit that but the reason this is so big is to have an
[1:02:25.640 --> 1:02:30.360]  internal government textbook an internal government policy book calling for a
[1:02:30.360 --> 1:02:36.160]  global policy that we now see implemented and we see him as Obama
[1:02:36.160 --> 1:02:45.800]  science advisor this just connected so many other dots that and it affirms that
[1:02:45.800 --> 1:02:49.720]  our analysis of how the new world order is operating what their master plan is
[1:02:49.720 --> 1:02:54.440]  is correct and then it was worse than we even thought and I know it's scary and
[1:02:54.440 --> 1:02:57.520]  hard to get folks to wake up to this fact and realize how serious it is I mean
[1:02:57.520 --> 1:03:03.520]  it really is amazing let's talk to Will in Texas will you're the first caller
[1:03:03.520 --> 1:03:08.640]  than George Sherry Ray Scott and others go ahead will
[1:03:27.440 --> 1:03:30.400]  yeah that's because they've got to get you in fighting in the name of
[1:03:30.400 --> 1:03:34.360]  multiculturalism so they can play humanity off against each other so
[1:03:34.360 --> 1:03:38.080]  humanity never gets together and realizes the overlords the social
[1:03:38.080 --> 1:03:43.680]  engineers the social architects are the real enemy and so in the name of
[1:03:43.680 --> 1:03:48.480]  multiculturalism they create the divisions but absolutely IBM is a
[1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:54.120]  complete money trust to carry out eugenics the hollereth machine was
[1:03:54.120 --> 1:03:58.680]  invented for race mixing studies in the United States that was in the machine
[1:03:58.680 --> 1:04:02.560]  with the tattoos on the people in the death camps to decide how much to feed
[1:04:02.560 --> 1:04:07.600]  them how much to work on the death our entire society is run and engineered to
[1:04:07.600 --> 1:04:18.480]  carry out eugenics you know I don't know who came with the term ethnic group but
[1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:25.600]  I know anthropologists and sociologists did but I know that Obama's science
[1:04:25.600 --> 1:04:33.560]  advisor John P. Holdren is part of the same society that Julian Huxley and
[1:04:33.560 --> 1:04:37.040]  Bertrand Russell were part of and that's coming up later in the show anything
[1:04:37.040 --> 1:04:42.960]  else all right thank you yeah his his phone was really bad or I'm getting some
[1:04:42.960 --> 1:04:46.280]  bad audio here's we need to get that straight before we come back to the full
[1:04:46.280 --> 1:04:50.080]  audience here all right more calls straight ahead your questions on eugenics
[1:04:50.080 --> 1:04:54.200]  eugenics only because what else is there I mean they're killing us this is
[1:04:54.200 --> 1:05:02.040]  pretty important info this is Alex Jones I want to tell you again about a

[1:06:30.880 --> 1:06:35.400]  then I'm going to suspend calls for the balance of the transmission the last
[1:06:35.400 --> 1:06:41.640]  30 minutes and I want to not just go over the fact that there's a planetary
[1:06:41.640 --> 1:06:45.800]  world government that is setting up a global carbon tax to destroy all
[1:06:45.800 --> 1:06:52.760]  industry so that populations are unsustainable but the mindset of these
[1:06:52.760 --> 1:06:55.720]  people and why they're doing it they are not doing it to even help the planet
[1:06:55.720 --> 1:06:59.960]  and they're on record bragging about this but they're low-level minions that
[1:06:59.960 --> 1:07:04.200]  follow this guy or religion they are doing it for the planet and so we need
[1:07:04.200 --> 1:07:07.960]  to stop being children here and stop denying this is going on I have posted
[1:07:07.960 --> 1:07:11.840]  scores of textbooks government documents United Nations biological diversity
[1:07:11.840 --> 1:07:19.680]  assessment 96 89 State Department of Random 200 the books written by his
[1:07:19.680 --> 1:07:24.480]  Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh Prince Charles father Queen of England's
[1:07:24.480 --> 1:07:31.520]  husband and there's thousands of these it's I've made a film about it a two-hour
[1:07:31.520 --> 1:07:38.320]  40-minute film called in game blueprint for global enslavement stop denying this
[1:07:38.320 --> 1:07:41.200]  if you're driving along in your car listening in Los Angeles or Chicago or
[1:07:41.200 --> 1:07:48.600]  Austin Texas or Miami or Buffalo New York stop living in denial if what I'm
[1:07:48.600 --> 1:07:53.600]  saying is true isn't this the only issue isn't this the most important issue
[1:07:53.600 --> 1:07:56.520]  this is why they're setting up world government why they're bankrupting the
[1:07:56.520 --> 1:08:04.680]  world economy and they bragging say they are they say that's why they have CPS
[1:08:04.680 --> 1:08:10.320]  is to take your kids and sterilize them that's what CPS was set up for almost
[1:08:10.320 --> 1:08:18.080]  90 years ago in this country Hitler got all his ideas from these people the head
[1:08:18.080 --> 1:08:22.600]  of science for Obama the head of his science office openly writes a book
[1:08:22.600 --> 1:08:25.720]  called eco science calling for forced sterilization forced abortion a
[1:08:25.720 --> 1:08:30.360]  worldwide police state and poisons in the water to sterilize you and now most
[1:08:30.360 --> 1:08:34.560]  people are sterile or near sterile and then we've named specifically what
[1:08:34.560 --> 1:08:38.080]  they're doing and how they're doing it the UN's been caught adding hormones to
[1:08:38.080 --> 1:08:44.960]  tetanus shots that sterilize women mainstream news they're doing it I said
[1:08:44.960 --> 1:08:48.520]  I take calls let's go to calls let's talk to George in Texas George you're on
[1:08:48.520 --> 1:08:53.800]  the air are you doing Alex can you hear me good sir yes you're on the air can
[1:08:53.800 --> 1:08:58.840]  you hear me yes I can Alex you know when I live in Florida I remember I work for
[1:08:58.840 --> 1:09:02.640]  a nursing home for a year and I you know I couldn't understand why they were
[1:09:02.640 --> 1:09:07.480]  pulling feeding tubes out of young people who had strokes and stuff and like
[1:09:07.480 --> 1:09:11.760]  you said on they were asked for water and were told nothing by mouth it was all
[1:09:11.760 --> 1:09:18.880]  done under the consulting of a bioethicist bioethicist transhumanist the
[1:09:18.880 --> 1:09:24.200]  eugenics quarterly openly wrote we're changing our name and they changed their
[1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:27.880]  names to this and now they govern and rule things they're outside government
[1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:31.360]  they're the new priest class and even the wall street journals written last
[1:09:31.360 --> 1:09:35.400]  time I checked like a 20 part series by Wesley Smith where the people are
[1:09:35.400 --> 1:09:38.800]  begging for food and water and are murdered by the government they're not
[1:09:38.800 --> 1:09:43.480]  killing vegetables they're murdering people all coast to coast who can talk
[1:09:43.480 --> 1:09:49.600]  and and and naming them and they call I mean I know it's it's hardcore but we're
[1:09:49.600 --> 1:09:52.760]  not just talking about them they are killing the general public with soft
[1:09:52.760 --> 1:09:58.920]  kill weapons go ahead well even to I had an encounter with George Filos Michael
[1:09:58.920 --> 1:10:02.960]  Shibos lawyer and I tell you one you want to see you Genesis that guy is sick
[1:10:02.960 --> 1:10:10.000]  who wanted George Filos Michael Shibos an attorney who you know I start to death
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:14.640]  well they used her sure I know he is now and I appreciate your call George they
[1:10:14.640 --> 1:10:18.440]  used her because it looked like she was brain dead but then turned out she wasn't
[1:10:18.440 --> 1:10:22.400]  to kind of refute don't brush your teeth don't give her water by mouth took her
[1:10:22.400 --> 1:10:30.520]  15 days to die or Terry at her family on many times and it's just nightmarish I
[1:10:30.520 --> 1:10:34.400]  mean it's the same guy called Sheriff Terry beautiful when she was sitting there
[1:10:34.400 --> 1:10:39.560]  sobbing to death no I Genesis I hear you I appreciate your call George let's talk
[1:10:39.560 --> 1:10:47.520]  to sherry and Texas sherry are on the air yes hi hi hi I just want to let you
[1:10:47.520 --> 1:10:54.640]  know according to this this document it's the image archive on the American
[1:10:54.640 --> 1:11:00.520]  Eugenics movement yes by 1917 Congress had expanded the legal definition of
[1:11:00.520 --> 1:11:05.720]  those quote likely to become a public charge employed all idiots imbeciles
[1:11:05.720 --> 1:11:10.760]  people-minded persons epilepsy and same persons persons of constitutional
[1:11:10.760 --> 1:11:15.360]  psychopathic inferiority and mentally or physically defective now I mean that's
[1:11:15.360 --> 1:11:20.120]  pretty you know subjective I would say well let me just stop you ma'am that's
[1:11:20.120 --> 1:11:26.680]  public eugenics 34 states you know covered an end game 34 states passed
[1:11:26.680 --> 1:11:31.000]  laws they sterilize hundreds of thousands per decade that we know of they
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:37.280]  would kill babies they would take women who made below B pluses and sterilize
[1:11:37.280 --> 1:11:42.640]  them and we even have the official report cards they would have good race
[1:11:42.640 --> 1:11:47.520]  contest and then Hitler picked up all this from the US and England and the
[1:11:47.520 --> 1:11:51.840]  Rockefellers funded the Kaiser Velhelm Institute in Germany they funded the
[1:11:51.840 --> 1:11:56.080]  Cold Springs Harbor facility now run by IBM and the human genome the head of
[1:11:56.080 --> 1:12:00.640]  the genome had to step down two years ago when he said blacks weren't human at
[1:12:00.640 --> 1:12:05.320]  IBM and of course that was covered in in game before he had to step down so you
[1:12:05.320 --> 1:12:11.160]  know we're ahead of the curb here but the issue is they tell the general
[1:12:11.160 --> 1:12:15.120]  public oh we're only killing the blacks the Mexicans and the stupid whites which
[1:12:15.120 --> 1:12:20.760]  is bad enough but for racists they need to know no they advertise it as positive
[1:12:20.760 --> 1:12:24.360]  and negative eugenics we're gonna breed the elite to live longer be smarter be
[1:12:24.360 --> 1:12:28.720]  better-looking be healthier but we're also going to then sterilize and
[1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:32.800]  exterminate and for support and Ruth Bader Ginsburg by the way is the
[1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:35.640]  Associated Press saying we got to keep abortion to get rid of the stupid people
[1:12:35.640 --> 1:12:38.920]  so this very liberal and loving when Margaret Sanger saying blacks are
[1:12:38.920 --> 1:12:43.240]  subhumans need to be killed most you know many black public schools the one I
[1:12:43.240 --> 1:12:46.680]  went to in Dallas was named Margaret Sanger elementary so it's about
[1:12:46.680 --> 1:12:50.520]  worshipping those that murder you it's so liberal and loving again a real
[1:12:50.520 --> 1:12:53.840]  Nazi doesn't wear a Nazi uniform they come with a pony telling Birkenstocks
[1:12:53.840 --> 1:13:00.560]  and go hi I'm liberal oh I have a shot oh yeah see that's how this I'm serious
[1:13:00.560 --> 1:13:05.120]  folks it's so sickening I mean it's hard to stay calm when you talk about this
[1:13:05.120 --> 1:13:10.720]  but they advertise positive and negative eugenics that's not even eugenics real
[1:13:10.720 --> 1:13:16.400]  eugenics is about targeting the intelligent target because they say
[1:13:16.400 --> 1:13:20.560]  well we're gonna have rogue intelligent northern Europeans and Jews and some
[1:13:20.560 --> 1:13:26.640]  Japanese I don't agree with this this is their view and so we've got a recruit a
[1:13:26.640 --> 1:13:30.640]  few of them but dumb down and sterilize the rest we're gonna do that with sodium
[1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:36.120]  fluoride heavy metals in the water chemical weapons chemtrail spring and
[1:13:36.120 --> 1:13:41.520]  and and they say it so the point is they're hitting everybody and their main
[1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:48.000]  target is northern Europeans and it's actually run by northern Europeans you
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:54.120]  understand ma'am absolutely what do you think of that I think it's horrible I
[1:13:54.120 --> 1:13:59.000]  think it's it's it's whenever I read that I was I was just so worth I couldn't
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  even answer for a while on the on the forum I'm a moderator for the eugenics
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:08.440]  section and I just I couldn't even believe what I was reading because he's
[1:14:08.440 --> 1:14:14.800]  the head of the science for the entire country isn't he yes and he still says
[1:14:14.800 --> 1:14:20.120]  he still says sterilize women forcibly we need we need eugenics police that
[1:14:20.120 --> 1:14:25.160]  that come and murder your babies pardon me he wrote that a long time ago right
[1:14:25.160 --> 1:14:30.840]  because he wrote it in 77 but he's the head of the green carbon tax and he
[1:14:30.840 --> 1:14:36.720]  says it so you'll have less children there they're now implementing it
[1:14:36.720 --> 1:14:41.400]  California is getting rid of the tax credit when you have a family or are
[1:14:41.400 --> 1:14:47.680]  married see and next it will be like China started in 1975 with a tax to
[1:14:47.680 --> 1:14:51.640]  have kids Australia is now proposing and I appreciate your call good to hear from
[1:14:51.640 --> 1:14:57.680]  you Sherry they are now proposing a tax in fact people won't believe that Google
[1:14:57.680 --> 1:15:03.240]  it for him right now search engine in Australia tax children for carbon
[1:15:03.240 --> 1:15:08.840]  footprint or children bad for carbon footprint show see folks none of this is
[1:15:08.840 --> 1:15:14.240]  my opinion I couldn't make stuff up like this and the reason I'm so freaked out
[1:15:14.240 --> 1:15:19.840]  today is I already have hundreds of their documents and textbooks but they'll
[1:15:19.840 --> 1:15:23.480]  put a piece here or put a piece there or I'll have a government document about
[1:15:23.480 --> 1:15:27.760]  them putting stuff in the water to sterilize us or I'll have them on CNBC
[1:15:27.760 --> 1:15:30.400]  saying we ought to put stuff in the water to sterilize people are we ought to
[1:15:30.400 --> 1:15:36.080]  put Prozac in the water and now they've been caught doing it it's that it's all
[1:15:36.080 --> 1:15:40.840]  in this textbook how to do it for world government this is a policy textbook
[1:15:40.840 --> 1:15:47.440]  for continual education for university heads and there's university heads
[1:15:47.440 --> 1:15:51.200]  listening everywhere they get off on this power they're like well we have to do
[1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:56.120]  it for the earth but that's a mid-level compartmentalization at the top it's all
[1:15:56.120 --> 1:16:02.120]  about control and power and controlling the future this is Alex Jones with five
[1:16:02.120 --> 1:16:05.720]  good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer

[1:16:29.320 --> 1:16:32.880]  summer storm season is here again every year thousands of families lose their
[1:16:32.880 --> 1:16:36.880]  power from weather related outages number five a solar power generator
[1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:40.760]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in
[1:16:40.760 --> 1:16:44.160]  the solar power generators offered by solutions from science a long-time

[1:21:06.920 --> 1:21:11.080]  textbooks and documents hundreds and hundreds I have from the US government
[1:21:11.080 --> 1:21:14.880]  alone that they're putting poisons in your water when you hear the term
[1:21:14.880 --> 1:21:20.880]  fluoride in your water that is a by federal law a cover name for over 200
[1:21:20.880 --> 1:21:27.800]  chemicals lead mercury arsenic sodium fluoride and these are the best chemicals
[1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:31.800]  they found to sterilize people and hence we do have a sterilization and I have
[1:21:31.800 --> 1:21:35.480]  government documents where Russell and others talk about how they want to
[1:21:35.480 --> 1:21:39.080]  sterilize this with fluoride in the water I have the University of Texas at
[1:21:39.080 --> 1:21:44.600]  Austin in the 30s 1934 fluoride study about how it's a great overall drug

[1:22:44.800 --> 1:22:49.960]  shot by their social work social welfare people and it showed a pregnant 30
[1:22:49.960 --> 1:22:54.480]  something woman who had eight children who was on the government dole and their
[1:22:54.480 --> 1:22:57.880]  premise was because she was unrestricting her reproduction that they
[1:22:57.880 --> 1:23:02.000]  had a right to go in and stop it because they were providing everything for her
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:08.040]  and of course they showed her as making poor choices here and there and I think
[1:23:08.040 --> 1:23:11.440]  they did it on purpose because most no they admit it man man that's the
[1:23:11.440 --> 1:23:15.040]  exactly right that was in my list of points I wanted to make I'm glad you
[1:23:15.040 --> 1:23:20.040]  brought it up is that they they admit in their internal documents we've got to
[1:23:20.040 --> 1:23:24.360]  socially educate the public use examples of bad parents with lots of kids
[1:23:24.360 --> 1:23:29.880]  set the precedent to take their kids with CPS to then set up a society where
[1:23:29.880 --> 1:23:34.240]  all children are basically raised by the state where the kids are at you know
[1:23:34.240 --> 1:23:38.900]  government-controlled schools even after hours 12 15 hours a day only sleep at
[1:23:38.900 --> 1:23:44.360]  home during the next phase then the next phase we fully take the kids away this
[1:23:44.360 --> 1:23:49.600]  is incremental domestication China already has that model they adopted for
[1:23:49.600 --> 1:23:55.520]  IMF and World Bank money these rules in 1981 and yes ma'am we are now under those
[1:23:55.520 --> 1:24:01.080]  and I have a AP article I was trying to dig out with Ruth Bader Ginsburg here it
[1:24:01.080 --> 1:24:05.840]  is Justice Ginsburg says she originally thought Roe v. Wade was designed to
[1:24:05.840 --> 1:24:10.080]  limit populations that we don't want to have too many of like blacks and
[1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:17.640]  Mexicans isn't that nice here zoom in on her now again this is liberal and then
[1:24:17.640 --> 1:24:21.520]  ma'am you're a racist if you want the blacks breeding okay you've got to become
[1:24:21.520 --> 1:24:29.280]  liberal oh it's so liberal I just brought this up because Deutsche
[1:24:29.280 --> 1:24:35.080]  Vela after like oh shame on her you know and my personal opinion is that she
[1:24:35.080 --> 1:24:39.920]  can't afford one child she should not have nine well the point is obviously the
[1:24:39.920 --> 1:24:43.680]  woman's probably a lazy fat hog on welfare but if you don't have a big
[1:24:43.680 --> 1:24:47.960]  government pimp system where everybody's got to pay for other people then all of
[1:24:47.960 --> 1:24:52.120]  us aren't all of us aren't in this big pool together all micromanaged and
[1:24:52.120 --> 1:24:55.840]  controlled they don't want to control her with the eight kids they want kids to
[1:24:55.840 --> 1:24:59.840]  CPS do medical experiments on and they brag about that calling them subhuman
[1:24:59.840 --> 1:25:04.240]  what they really want is to go after the smart and intelligent as their
[1:25:04.240 --> 1:25:07.760]  internal documents say that's why they target the kids that raise their hand
[1:25:07.760 --> 1:25:12.200]  and speak up a lot the leadership males and females that's why it's the wealthy
[1:25:12.200 --> 1:25:15.960]  parents given their kids the Gardasil shot that just so happens to be
[1:25:15.960 --> 1:25:19.680]  sterilizing them and killing them oh don't believe me Google Gardasil killing
[1:25:19.680 --> 1:25:24.080]  girls will show you mainstream news well I just wanted to verify that Deutsche
[1:25:24.080 --> 1:25:27.400]  Vela had had this on like isn't this a good thing we're gonna take her kids
[1:25:27.400 --> 1:25:32.960]  away so you're right it's all over and it's come in here and thank you God
[1:25:32.960 --> 1:25:36.840]  bless you Ray and I want to point out again it's all sold like it's to save
[1:25:36.840 --> 1:25:40.200]  the earth it's for the earth it has nothing to do with that their genetic
[1:25:40.200 --> 1:25:45.840]  engineering their cross species planting the toxic waste dumping deforestation
[1:25:45.840 --> 1:25:50.400]  some of that is a real problem overfishing in the ocean is a serious
[1:25:50.400 --> 1:25:55.680]  problem in many regions there are some problems the land doesn't need to be
[1:25:55.680 --> 1:26:02.560]  left fallow sometimes rotated but that has nothing to do with this this is
[1:26:02.560 --> 1:26:07.240]  about race this is about controlling the future this is about extermination and
[1:26:07.240 --> 1:26:11.440]  world government let's talk to Scott in Washington and Dr. Kelly Al and others
[1:26:11.440 --> 1:26:17.800]  let's talk to Scott go ahead Scott yeah you know something I think is my
[1:26:17.800 --> 1:26:21.960]  question is probably gonna piss off a lot of people who are into this and I
[1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:25.160]  don't know maybe it's just me or something but maybe they need to just
[1:26:25.160 --> 1:26:27.960]  kill themselves I mean if they want to kill babies and then there's too many
[1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:32.440]  people how about they lead the way is that what you were about to say no what
[1:26:32.440 --> 1:26:37.600]  I was referring to is this that this zeitgeist then the movie movie and it
[1:26:37.600 --> 1:26:41.680]  thinks to me maybe it's just me but it seems like there's oh how there's gonna
[1:26:41.680 --> 1:26:46.480]  be a global government run by a robot that'll heal the earth and I'll have to
[1:26:46.480 --> 1:26:51.320]  be sent for reeducation the maker of it said yeah what's wrong with reeducation
[1:26:51.320 --> 1:26:55.480]  look I appreciate your call Scott but we're not talking about that right now
[1:26:55.480 --> 1:27:02.680]  okay but it reeducation is wonderful we're gonna come back talk to Dr. Kelly
[1:27:02.680 --> 1:27:10.320]  Allen a few others 888-201-2244-888-201-2244 but listen if you're a new
[1:27:10.320 --> 1:27:15.120]  listener like what's this guy yelling and screaming about the guy the
[1:27:15.120 --> 1:27:21.000]  individual John P. Holdren who is the president's head of science and
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:26.080]  technology for the entire federal government openly wrote a book a textbook
[1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:31.040]  level book for government and academics a policy book for world government for
[1:27:31.040 --> 1:27:37.520]  sterilization forced population reduction and then we've proven in their
[1:27:37.520 --> 1:27:40.560]  other documents through vaccines and things they're sterilizing us giving us
[1:27:40.560 --> 1:27:47.920]  cancer this is serious and I'm just begging listeners out there to please
[1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:54.240]  investigate more Michael Jackson dying should not be the biggest story of the
[1:27:54.240 --> 1:27:57.320]  year this story right here from one in Telegraph Michael Jackson's death is
[1:27:57.320 --> 1:28:01.000]  officially the second biggest internet news story of the 21st century according
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:06.480]  to new figures only the election of president Barack Obama another non-issued
[1:28:06.480 --> 1:28:11.800]  and just a new puppet to the White House eclipsed the death of the king of pop
[1:28:11.800 --> 1:28:17.560]  at the age of 50 research by global language monitor GLM found Jackson's
[1:28:17.560 --> 1:28:22.000]  death received more coverage in the Iraq war 9-1-1 and the global financial
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:25.840]  meltdown last year's Beijing Olympics hurricane Katrina and the death of Pope
[1:28:25.840 --> 1:28:33.280]  John Paul II and the tsunami all that's happened in the last nine years now the

[1:33:32.600 --> 1:33:36.480]  policymakers about how to poison the food and water how to spray the air how to
[1:33:36.480 --> 1:33:40.600]  kill babies how to grab babies away from others with the CPS and kill them and
[1:33:40.600 --> 1:33:45.400]  it's liberal and loving and good and they really care about you 12 was
[1:33:45.400 --> 1:33:49.040]  Planned Parenthoods run by Margaret Sanger who was worshiped by Hitler is so
[1:33:49.040 --> 1:33:54.600]  liberal and good Aaron you had a few Aaron Dixon here in the office I had a
[1:33:54.600 --> 1:33:59.240]  few quotes there from good old Bertrand Russell also worshiped by the liberals
[1:33:59.240 --> 1:34:03.840]  about scientific dictatorships and eugenics that Obama's science director
[1:34:03.840 --> 1:34:08.120]  saying the carbon tax is a neo feudalism so they can control every
[1:34:08.120 --> 1:34:13.400]  facet economy and bankrupt us so we can't afford to have kids get us off the
[1:34:13.400 --> 1:34:18.020]  ranches off the farms into the compact cities get us all in welfare and then
[1:34:18.020 --> 1:34:21.880]  under the rule I'm sorry everybody's paying for you you can't have kids
[1:34:21.880 --> 1:34:25.960]  meanwhile we're drinking poison the water and being sterilized and our young
[1:34:25.960 --> 1:34:29.480]  girls are drinking GMO milk and going into puberty when they're five years old
[1:34:29.480 --> 1:34:33.440]  and then dying of breast cancer when they're 25 it's I guess it's fun to be
[1:34:33.440 --> 1:34:38.400]  under a soft kill weapon attack it's frightening and and the state is going
[1:34:38.400 --> 1:34:42.920]  to decide who can reproduce take the babies from the teen mothers but yeah
[1:34:42.920 --> 1:34:45.760]  one of the frightening things I noticed when looking up Holder's
[1:34:45.760 --> 1:34:49.800]  background is that he's a member of the pug wash conference which was Bertrand
[1:34:49.800 --> 1:34:54.880]  Russell's organization and you know this whole thing about the the world
[1:34:54.880 --> 1:34:59.800]  society deciding over sterilization eugenics reminds me of this Bertrand
[1:34:59.800 --> 1:35:04.480]  Russell quote where it says a scientific world society will be necessary to find
[1:35:04.480 --> 1:35:09.600]  ways of preventing an increase in world population it cannot be stable unless
[1:35:09.600 --> 1:35:13.480]  there's a world government if this is to be done otherwise than by wars
[1:35:13.480 --> 1:35:18.840]  pestilence and famines it will demand a powerful international authority and
[1:35:18.840 --> 1:35:22.960]  that's what state Department of random 200 says it says it's our policy to use
[1:35:22.960 --> 1:35:27.560]  wars famines and sterilization and IMF and World Bank money bankrupt the
[1:35:27.560 --> 1:35:33.840]  countries by design it says to then force them to castrate the men and tie
[1:35:33.840 --> 1:35:37.200]  the tubes of the women because in the third world they don't want you getting
[1:35:37.200 --> 1:35:40.760]  hooked back up they just they just grab you and cut them off and this is what's
[1:35:40.760 --> 1:35:44.280]  really going on but here they hit us through the water supply and here's
[1:35:44.280 --> 1:35:50.120]  Obama's advisor saying put it in the water yeah it's and the two most
[1:35:50.120 --> 1:35:54.800]  extreme eugenics I've come across is Bertrand Russell who calls for a return
[1:35:54.800 --> 1:35:59.360]  of the back black plague and this poll early guy who will go to every means
[1:35:59.360 --> 1:36:03.240]  possible and this Holdren it has background roots with both of them and
[1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:08.880]  the fact that we have his book his policy book which I mean the quotes are all
[1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:14.000]  here it says compulsory abortions carried out against the will of the
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:20.120]  pregnant women as this commonplace in communist China it says putting
[1:36:20.120 --> 1:36:25.640]  chemicals in the food and water to forcibly sterilize the population
[1:36:25.640 --> 1:36:29.920]  implement a system of involuntary birth control where both men and women would
[1:36:29.920 --> 1:36:35.440]  be mandated to have an infertility device of plant in their body at puberty
[1:36:35.440 --> 1:36:39.160]  and only haven't removed temporarily if they were received permission from the
[1:36:39.160 --> 1:36:44.640]  government to have a baby this is him on record this is his quotes
[1:36:45.200 --> 1:36:49.600]  permanently sterilizing people who the authorities deemed to have had too many
[1:36:49.600 --> 1:36:54.520]  children are who have contributed to general social deterioration and again
[1:36:54.520 --> 1:36:59.800]  this is common this is you know supposedly common sense I guarantee
[1:36:59.800 --> 1:37:03.320]  there people listen on the radio going yeah there are too many dumb poor stupid
[1:37:03.320 --> 1:37:06.520]  people we got to pay for well don't pay for them don't have a government
[1:37:06.520 --> 1:37:10.640]  welfare system to pay but see the eugenicists set that up they said well
[1:37:10.640 --> 1:37:14.680]  in the to get them domesticated and they say at first this will cause them to
[1:37:14.680 --> 1:37:18.080]  breed and do all this but we're doing that to domesticate them so we can then
[1:37:18.080 --> 1:37:22.480]  just wipe them all out once they're fully dependent on us so see the first
[1:37:22.480 --> 1:37:26.120]  phase they get you dependent as the Royal Commission says in the next phase
[1:37:26.120 --> 1:37:30.200]  we're now entering they start doing the soft kill weapons system where 25 year
[1:37:30.200 --> 1:37:33.120]  olds are down to cancer and have Alzheimer's and then they talk about that
[1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:37.680]  here as well they would all be overseen by a transnational centralized
[1:37:37.680 --> 1:37:42.040]  planetary regime that would utilize a global police force these are quotes
[1:37:42.040 --> 1:37:45.560]  to enforce the measures outlined above the planetary regime would also have
[1:37:45.560 --> 1:37:49.040]  the power to determine population levels for every country in the world
[1:37:49.920 --> 1:37:53.720]  compulsory population control laws even putting laws requiring compulsory
[1:37:53.720 --> 1:37:57.680]  abortion could be sustained under the existing Constitution the population
[1:37:57.680 --> 1:38:02.040]  crisis became sufficiently severe to endanger the society and he said in
[1:38:02.040 --> 1:38:06.880]  the 77 will use the threat of global warming to push this which they admit
[1:38:06.880 --> 1:38:11.440]  isn't even real that's right and then they're gonna cover now now all these
[1:38:11.440 --> 1:38:16.280]  years we've been exposing chemtrails there was the Nobel Prize when we're
[1:38:16.280 --> 1:38:20.200]  actually making a film about this in 92 a gentleman in the US wins a Nobel
[1:38:20.200 --> 1:38:24.600]  Prize for saying spray barium salts and lumen dioxide mixed with jet fuel that
[1:38:24.600 --> 1:38:29.640]  will disperse it block sun rays and cool the earth but then climatologists and
[1:38:29.640 --> 1:38:33.680]  scientists said putting this nuclei out will actually on average increase the
[1:38:33.680 --> 1:38:36.560]  heat of the earth because the ultraviolet goes through bounces back up and
[1:38:36.560 --> 1:38:40.920]  is frozen and is captured since they implemented this on a planetary scale in
[1:38:40.920 --> 1:38:44.920]  96 the earth has gotten 20% darker according to NASA you can Google that
[1:38:44.920 --> 1:38:49.040]  term and it shows all the jet trails jet trails didn't start condensating and
[1:38:49.040 --> 1:38:53.400]  staying for more than a few minutes till the mid 90s we had this tested many
[1:38:53.400 --> 1:38:57.280]  mainline news groups did you mainstream news didn't said it's barium salt
[1:38:57.280 --> 1:39:01.440]  lumen dioxide the government said none of it exist you're crazy ice trails now
[1:39:01.440 --> 1:39:06.400]  form at 2,000 feet the middle of the summer which they don't then suddenly
[1:39:06.400 --> 1:39:11.960]  starting three months ago Obama's top science advisor this gentleman John P.
[1:39:11.960 --> 1:39:15.640]  Holdren calling for the four sterilization the spring the pudding
[1:39:15.640 --> 1:39:20.200]  stuff in the water and the food to sterilizes he comes out in AP in fact
[1:39:20.200 --> 1:39:24.000]  Google this for people on screen at presentplanet.tv for everybody else
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:28.240]  out there listening on the radio Google this for yourself Obama's science
[1:39:28.240 --> 1:39:36.200]  advisor says terraform earth to stop level warming or says Obama science
[1:39:36.200 --> 1:39:43.000]  chief says says release pollutants to cool earth he'll get AP Reuters all of
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:45.560]  it but the issue is then they come out in the Wall Street Journal and say it's
[1:39:45.560 --> 1:39:51.640]  time to cool the planet and say barium salts aluminum dioxide exactly what
[1:39:51.640 --> 1:39:56.160]  we've been saying they've been spraying so we're these crazies making this up now
[1:39:56.160 --> 1:39:59.840]  they come out and go oh we have been having thousands of universities and
[1:39:59.840 --> 1:40:03.960]  Department of Energy and other governments have been spraying since the
[1:40:03.960 --> 1:40:09.400]  early 90s as a test all of this testing spraying deadly chemicals on us that
[1:40:09.400 --> 1:40:13.480]  just so happened to cause Alzheimer's other degenerative neuro diseases with
[1:40:13.480 --> 1:40:17.840]  the neurons in the brain and the rest of the body the entire nervous system
[1:40:17.840 --> 1:40:22.120]  central nervous and the general nervous system now exactly what we said they
[1:40:22.120 --> 1:40:26.600]  were doing is what they've announced but it was only a test the real program is
[1:40:26.600 --> 1:40:31.120]  about to begin and Atlantic monthly comes out with images of giant blimps
[1:40:31.120 --> 1:40:36.120]  changing the entire atmosphere which the climatologists say and the weather
[1:40:36.120 --> 1:40:38.920]  warriors we've had on like Ben Livingston the father of other weapons
[1:40:38.920 --> 1:40:42.960]  saying this will actually destroy the environment so they're actually going to
[1:40:42.960 --> 1:40:47.280]  screw things up so there is a global meltdown so people can't have crops with
[1:40:47.280 --> 1:40:51.120]  controlled droughts and floods to then say see we got to have a world government
[1:40:51.120 --> 1:40:55.680]  for the floods and droughts they created these guys are problem reaction
[1:40:55.680 --> 1:40:59.400]  solution terrorists they create the crises to offer the solution air and
[1:40:59.400 --> 1:41:03.520]  ice yeah and Bertrand Russell says in the same quote that these international
[1:41:03.520 --> 1:41:08.160]  authorities will control food and if the population of one nation should go up
[1:41:08.160 --> 1:41:12.200]  they're going to reciprocate by withholding food you see so they're
[1:41:12.200 --> 1:41:16.320]  going to control populations their food which is the GMO which they continue to
[1:41:16.320 --> 1:41:19.960]  study the GMO and they've manipulated and changed genes of the plants to create
[1:41:19.960 --> 1:41:23.960]  chemicals that sterilize all mammal species and so again the sperm counts
[1:41:23.960 --> 1:41:29.640]  plunged over 80% women are infertile over 80% they're already doing it we
[1:41:29.640 --> 1:41:34.400]  are now under attack but that's fine if AIDS is engineered that's fine if humans
[1:41:34.400 --> 1:41:38.800]  are heard by barium salts aluminum oxide and this other stuff because climate
[1:41:38.800 --> 1:41:42.440]  change remember as they said in the climate club of Rome quote is just the
[1:41:42.440 --> 1:41:47.240]  symptom its humanity that's the problem and they said the head of the CFR while
[1:41:47.240 --> 1:41:50.640]  writing for the club of Rome in 1992 Richard and Haas said it's a double
[1:41:50.640 --> 1:41:54.800]  pincers stage terror will be used for the police state to build it but that
[1:41:54.800 --> 1:41:58.680]  police states really to carry out the four sterilizations and the green tax
[1:41:58.680 --> 1:42:03.360]  and the new home inspections and the control okay the other side of the
[1:42:03.360 --> 1:42:09.720]  pincers is the environmental movement and is the new priesthood and they found
[1:42:09.720 --> 1:42:13.040]  the article with him the first time he had a meeting with the press he said we
[1:42:13.040 --> 1:42:16.480]  got to reform the planet keep going Aaron I'm trying to find the blimp image
[1:42:16.480 --> 1:42:20.760]  well it's just that his very quotes say they're gonna seize the children and
[1:42:20.760 --> 1:42:25.240]  that the parents will have to then go apply to be parents basically that's
[1:42:25.240 --> 1:42:29.760]  it it's Nazi Germany it's pre-crime and Obama says everybody's gonna be under
[1:42:29.760 --> 1:42:33.240]  pre-crime now and the new freedom initiative says all kids will be drug and
[1:42:33.240 --> 1:42:37.280]  all kids will basically be taken and everybody who does head start gets three
[1:42:37.280 --> 1:42:41.920]  CPS visits a year and they're making trying to make head start mandatory now
[1:42:41.920 --> 1:42:46.800]  we get back I'm gonna find the here it is the Kim trail moving heaven and earth
[1:42:46.800 --> 1:42:50.880]  here it is in Atlantic monthly saying they're gonna have giant blimp
[1:42:50.880 --> 1:42:55.040]  surveilling us and Kim trailing us I mean they're heading us hard and then the
[1:42:55.040 --> 1:42:58.360]  yuppies have been preconditioned that none of this exists so they can't even

[1:47:11.160 --> 1:47:17.680]  my friends something else you can go search engine and pull up it was
[1:47:17.680 --> 1:47:26.200]  president Bush's task force that he set up on the environment and it was headed
[1:47:26.200 --> 1:47:32.640]  up among other people by Paul Ehrlich founder of zero population growth who
[1:47:32.640 --> 1:47:40.200]  is one of the people that wrote the book with this individual Obama's chief
[1:47:40.200 --> 1:47:46.320]  science advisor John P. Holdren so the co-author of the book the government
[1:47:46.320 --> 1:47:50.720]  textbook about forced sterilization forced abortion world government carbon
[1:47:50.720 --> 1:47:57.360]  taxes to control us he's George Bush's advisor see I mean that's my point is
[1:47:57.360 --> 1:48:00.920]  it's all these people this is the program this is what the shadow
[1:48:00.920 --> 1:48:04.360]  government works on this is what they do and I showed you the times of London
[1:48:04.360 --> 1:48:13.720]  with David Rockefeller Bill Gates Warren Buffett all these other people
[1:48:13.720 --> 1:48:19.120]  quote meeting and secret rich meet in secret to discuss population reduction
[1:48:19.120 --> 1:48:26.160]  this is what they're setting up this is what they're doing and all I can do is
[1:48:26.160 --> 1:48:29.760]  beg the listeners out there to warn people and to get the word out to
[1:48:29.760 --> 1:48:36.000]  everybody and to make this a big issue you know they say oh trust the government
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:39.520]  take vaccines the government that was caught giving black men syphilis and
[1:48:39.520 --> 1:48:42.800]  letting them die of it over 45 years a government that was caught radiating
[1:48:42.800 --> 1:48:47.640]  4,000 plus us foster children to death and radiation test a government project
[1:48:47.640 --> 1:48:51.280]  shad that killed hundreds and hundreds of us soldiers with chemicals
[1:48:51.280 --> 1:48:55.400]  biologicals radiologicals knowing it would kill them and they did that to
[1:48:55.400 --> 1:48:59.240]  create cadres of killers when I showed in-game blueprint for global
[1:48:59.240 --> 1:49:04.560]  enslavement in Austin Texas at Alamo draft house on South Lamar two years
[1:49:04.560 --> 1:49:11.000]  ago one of the chief people in Rick Perry's office showed up and he said I
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:15.480]  heard Rick Perry's in the film listener of the show I wanted to see it because
[1:49:15.480 --> 1:49:18.120]  it was about part of it's about Rick Perry going to Billerberg just a five
[1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:22.720]  minutes of it and he said I want you to know that 14 years ago I was at Fort
[1:49:22.720 --> 1:49:29.360]  Sam Houston down in San Antonio as a medic and they brought in these special
[1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:34.040]  forces troops they gave them shots and three days later they were all dead we
[1:49:34.040 --> 1:49:38.560]  had to put on decon suits go in spray chemicals everywhere strip out the
[1:49:38.560 --> 1:49:45.200]  entire barracks and he said I know this stuff's real folks psychopathic control
[1:49:45.200 --> 1:49:50.480]  freak killers are running our government in our society now I know we have Dr.
[1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:55.040]  Kelly that's what the callers calling themselves Al Chris Jeff Paul Tom Ronnie
[1:49:55.040 --> 1:50:00.200]  Rob Ed and others here's what's going to happen we're on the AM and FM dial for

[1:50:04.440 --> 1:50:09.680]  at prisonplanet.tv and on the free streams at info wars.com I'm going to
[1:50:09.680 --> 1:50:14.520]  do 10 minutes only because I got other stuff I got to do in meetings and some
[1:50:14.520 --> 1:50:18.960]  of my guys got to go to family barbecues and stuff so we're going to do 10
[1:50:18.960 --> 1:50:23.200]  minutes to take the rest of your calls what's funny about that it's true you

[1:53:14.760 --> 1:53:18.800]  script meeting and private meeting in New York City ABC's John Berman has the
[1:53:18.800 --> 1:53:25.840]  scoop on who was there and what was going on behind closed doors on this
[1:53:25.840 --> 1:53:30.320]  New York campus a secret gathering of some of the world's most powerful people
[1:53:30.320 --> 1:53:37.440]  Gates Buffett Bloomberg Winfrey it was like well it was like the Super Friends
[1:53:37.440 --> 1:53:54.560]  the Justice League all these eugenicists and maybe Oprah Winfrey is a
[1:53:54.560 --> 1:53:57.680]  useful idiot they're trying to suck in but she's involved in all this weird new
[1:53:57.680 --> 1:54:03.160]  age world government crap as well but this is so sick I mean I know these two
[1:54:03.160 --> 1:54:08.680]  are top eugenicist Buffett and and Gates and they also serve David Rockefeller as
[1:54:08.680 --> 1:54:14.520]  the flash he's got a lightning bolt on his chest which is fitting I mean it's
[1:54:14.520 --> 1:54:19.280]  in the encyclopedia Britannica under eugenics it says the Rockefeller family
[1:54:19.280 --> 1:54:26.160]  started it funded Hitler run the human genome it's them baby oh they're always
[1:54:26.160 --> 1:54:32.200]  killing people in tests but no let's take shots they gave us they love us stop
[1:54:32.200 --> 1:54:37.360]  being so naive idiots your lives depend on this this scum thinks you're stupid
[1:54:37.360 --> 1:54:42.400]  won't wake up and stand up I'm risking my life to tell you this we need to have a
[1:54:42.400 --> 1:54:48.120]  debate about this humanity needs to discuss this I mean the very same
[1:54:48.120 --> 1:54:51.320]  people calling for eugenics are calling for him trailing us after they
[1:54:51.320 --> 1:54:57.240]  denied it existed they're spraying us with poison I'm living in the Twilight
[1:54:57.240 --> 1:55:00.440]  Zone episode you don't think I'm not selfish you don't think I don't want to
[1:55:00.440 --> 1:55:05.280]  take time off and have fun my family and my wife and kids but I can't folks you
[1:55:05.280 --> 1:55:09.920]  think I like facing these fears what does life matter if you end up living a
[1:55:09.920 --> 1:55:15.560]  worthless life and don't stand up a tyranny out of fear we have no future
[1:55:15.560 --> 1:55:19.920]  we got to stand up against this back it up as they show them as super heroes I
[1:55:19.920 --> 1:55:25.000]  mean how disgusting show it again here it is this is sick in the great hall of
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:32.240]  justice together with others at the meeting including George Soros Ted
[1:55:32.240 --> 1:55:35.880]  Turner David Rockefeller they're worth more than a hundred and twenty five
[1:55:35.880 --> 1:55:40.720]  billion dollars to have been in the room and and see this meeting up the minds
[1:55:40.720 --> 1:55:44.920]  really would have been a fascinating thing that much money that much power
[1:55:44.920 --> 1:55:50.000]  around one table it begs the question what were they doing what were they
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:55.280]  scheming total world domination this group together for six hours was talking
[1:55:55.280 --> 1:56:01.120]  about charity education emergency relief global health all my friends are
[1:56:01.120 --> 1:56:04.720]  philanthropic well they probably wouldn't be my friends an official at the
[1:56:04.720 --> 1:56:09.440]  Gates Foundation told ABC news comm the overwhelming reason for the meeting was
[1:56:09.440 --> 1:56:14.040]  need that was the issue that galvanized everyone to participate together
[1:56:14.040 --> 1:56:18.960]  they've given away seventy billion dollars since 1996 and with the sagging
[1:56:18.960 --> 1:56:24.400]  economy their help could be just what struggling charities need charities are
[1:56:24.400 --> 1:56:27.480]  hurting and somebody has to speak for all these charities and if they want
[1:56:27.480 --> 1:56:31.200]  philanthropy to be robust in the future in the United States these are the people
[1:56:31.200 --> 1:56:34.880]  where you really want to be talking about it the new superman and wonder
[1:56:34.880 --> 1:56:40.120]  woman the super rich friends not fighting bad guys but fighting for good
[1:56:40.120 --> 1:56:47.160]  nonetheless all they're fighting for good easy news that's enough now the
[1:56:47.160 --> 1:56:51.240]  times of London said billionaire club and bid to curb over population and
[1:56:51.240 --> 1:56:59.160]  talks about the same meeting by John Harlow Los Angeles oh there it's global
[1:56:59.160 --> 1:57:02.280]  health but seeing their weird lawyers speak it's the globe's health to get
[1:57:02.280 --> 1:57:05.560]  rid of all these people but it is even about that they say it's about the elite
[1:57:05.560 --> 1:57:09.680]  having access to the life extension technologies that they believe they can
[1:57:09.680 --> 1:57:13.240]  extend their lives in their 20 30 years the technology will be so advanced
[1:57:13.240 --> 1:57:17.120]  they're all on record saying this that it'll be unlimited life extension but
[1:57:17.120 --> 1:57:21.160]  the public can't have access so they're already suppressing the technologies
[1:57:21.160 --> 1:57:26.560]  that are the bridge to this system in the national security reservations above
[1:57:26.560 --> 1:57:30.440]  technological development that we're pretty much frozen in this is the real
[1:57:30.440 --> 1:57:33.800]  world this is what affects your family they're putting poison in your food
[1:57:33.800 --> 1:57:37.560]  they're putting poison in your water they're carrying out these operations I
[1:57:37.560 --> 1:57:41.480]  just documented it with the president's own head of science calling for your
[1:57:41.480 --> 1:57:45.200]  forced sterilization great job crew this is the end of the main radio
[1:57:45.200 --> 1:57:49.880]  transmission but I'll continue at prisonplanet.tv and infowars.com right
[1:57:49.880 --> 1:57:54.560]  now this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[1:57:54.560 --> 1:57:58.240]  solar power generator this summer number one new climate legislation could
[1:57:58.240 --> 1:58:02.080]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[1:58:02.080 --> 1:58:06.200]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[1:58:06.200 --> 1:58:09.920]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:58:09.920 --> 1:58:14.240]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[1:58:14.240 --> 1:58:17.520]  dangerously overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[1:58:17.520 --> 1:58:21.480]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again every
[1:58:21.480 --> 1:58:25.160]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages number
[1:58:25.160 --> 1:58:29.160]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[1:58:29.160 --> 1:58:32.600]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[1:58:32.600 --> 1:58:35.960]  solutions from science a long time sponsor of ours you can get more

[2:00:08.200 --> 2:00:13.200]  Queen of England all publicly eugenicist their fathers and grandfathers and
[2:00:13.200 --> 2:00:17.080]  grandmothers and great-grandmothers set up eugenics on record that's a
[2:00:17.080 --> 2:00:20.640]  historical fact then after Hitler embarrassed them moving too quickly as
[2:00:20.640 --> 2:00:26.160]  they said they went underground and they took over society by stealth they
[2:00:26.160 --> 2:00:32.320]  created the social welfare system to get the public in their webs to capture the
[2:00:32.320 --> 2:00:40.240]  public and now the head of Obama's entire science division his science chief
[2:00:40.240 --> 2:00:45.440]  advisor is out in this big textbook calling for eugenics for sterilization
[2:00:45.440 --> 2:00:49.240]  a world government to carry it out forced abortions killing babies putting
[2:00:49.240 --> 2:00:53.320]  drugs in the water to sterilize you and in your food I never got to this on the
[2:00:53.320 --> 2:00:57.840]  main show we're gonna take ten calls and end it bored with PCs Bill Gates sets
[2:00:57.840 --> 2:01:07.640]  his sights on controlling the weather now see how Paul a John P. Holdren who
[2:01:07.640 --> 2:01:11.680]  co-authored the 1977 book which he advocated the formation of a planetary
[2:01:11.680 --> 2:01:16.600]  regime that would use global political force to enforce utilitarian measures
[2:01:16.600 --> 2:01:20.960]  on population control including forced abortions masterization programs
[2:01:20.960 --> 2:01:25.600]  conducted via the food supply and that's written by Paul Joseph Watson as well as
[2:01:25.600 --> 2:01:28.920]  mandatory bodily implants that would prevent cobbles from having children
[2:01:28.920 --> 2:01:36.560]  now he's calling for global climate manipulation to save the earth from
[2:01:36.560 --> 2:01:40.600]  greenhouse gases but then he admits that's all made up it's about shutting
[2:01:40.600 --> 2:01:45.400]  down the sunlight so plants can't grow the food we need so that people will
[2:01:45.400 --> 2:01:49.720]  starve to death and they say in their own documents they would do that Bill Gates
[2:01:49.720 --> 2:01:55.600]  the eugenicist separately is out seconding seconding Holdren this is in
[2:01:55.600 --> 2:02:03.000]  popular publication popular science bored with PCs Bill Gates sets his
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:08.320]  sights on controlling the weather oh and it's exactly what Stanford Research
[2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:14.080]  Institute certified in 1967 that Ben Livingston the father of weather weapons
[2:02:14.080 --> 2:02:20.240]  meteorologist broke here on this show that by the 60s they could create they
[2:02:20.240 --> 2:02:27.360]  could steer they could strengthen they could weaken hurricanes they're gonna
[2:02:27.360 --> 2:02:31.160]  use this stuff against us and then say oh look the earth's having serious
[2:02:31.160 --> 2:02:35.320]  problems we've got to take all your rights we've got to have a global carbon
[2:02:35.320 --> 2:02:41.560]  tax or the hurricanes won't stop dr. Kelly caller from California thanks for

[2:05:25.320 --> 2:05:28.240]  you I'm out of time I want to take a few more calls for me in the show because
[2:05:28.240 --> 2:05:32.880]  the cruise got to go but that's why I interrupt and jibber and jabber and
[2:05:32.880 --> 2:05:36.720]  always have more facts and more proof because it's so ridiculous they're
[2:05:36.720 --> 2:05:40.320]  openly saying they're killing us they're openly spraying us and then it's like
[2:05:40.320 --> 2:05:44.240]  oh I'm not supposed to talk about that kooks talk about that well but the media

[2:05:47.800 --> 2:05:52.040]  calling for world government here's Ruth Bader Ginsburg saying we need to get
[2:05:52.040 --> 2:05:56.680]  rid of the undesirables with abortion pope calls for world political authority
[2:05:56.680 --> 2:06:01.560]  I mean it's all real they're killing you and so many of these control freak
[2:06:01.560 --> 2:06:07.760]  yuppies are being killed by it but they are still for it it's a sick Al in
[2:06:07.760 --> 2:06:12.520]  Florida you're on the air hello mr. Jones how are you I'm doing all right
[2:06:12.520 --> 2:06:18.960]  Bubba good sir I just got something to add to your discussion on eugenics here
[2:06:18.960 --> 2:06:25.280]  it's revelations 1118 the nations were angry and your wrath has come the time
[2:06:25.280 --> 2:06:30.200]  has come for judging the dead and free rewarding your servants the prophets and
[2:06:30.200 --> 2:06:35.800]  your saints and those who reverence your name both small and great and this is
[2:06:35.800 --> 2:06:42.360]  why Jesus comes back and for destroying those who destroy the earth this is God's
[2:06:42.360 --> 2:06:46.720]  paradise it's not the world's property it's not the government property and the
[2:06:46.720 --> 2:06:50.440]  elite are the ones with the genetic engineering cross PCs that are actually
[2:06:50.440 --> 2:06:53.920]  hurting the earth and they brag about that none of this has anything with the
[2:06:53.920 --> 2:06:58.640]  earth it's about them hogging everything and being control freaks and setting up
[2:06:58.640 --> 2:07:02.960]  a dictatorship built around humans being bad I appreciate your call but if
[2:07:02.960 --> 2:07:06.800]  you're gonna quote revelations I would just add this caveat this addendum this
[2:07:06.800 --> 2:07:12.000]  proviso the fake churches are world council of churches Rockefeller
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:15.840]  controlled and they are saying lay down at the end of the world they thought
[2:07:15.840 --> 2:07:19.000]  that with Hitler it was the end of the world we got to fight this evil
[2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:25.280]  regardless thank you Al Chris and Canada you're on the air yes good evening
[2:07:25.280 --> 2:07:33.960]  Alex yeah I have a possible solution to some of this problem yeah expose these
[2:07:33.960 --> 2:07:38.200]  criminals take them on arrest them expose what murdering control freaks they
[2:07:38.200 --> 2:07:42.600]  are admit they're already hitting us with these systems the exact systems they
[2:07:42.600 --> 2:07:46.720]  propose and say they've been testing are the exact systems we've been saying
[2:07:46.720 --> 2:07:51.840]  for decades they had in place right we can we can do simple things these
[2:07:51.840 --> 2:07:57.080]  operations are being carried out now this is going on now I should have made
[2:07:57.080 --> 2:08:01.480]  that point earlier go ahead no no I totally agree with you but we can do
[2:08:01.480 --> 2:08:06.920]  simple things like using notices of understanding and claim of rights for
[2:08:06.920 --> 2:08:12.640]  health and where health and wellness and if you write these letters you have to
[2:08:12.640 --> 2:08:16.720]  write them to many different people what tell the elites to stop Kim trailing you
[2:08:16.720 --> 2:08:22.040]  and they stop with a letter what will the UCC code on or something well you
[2:08:22.040 --> 2:08:26.520]  have to get a notary public and sir sir listen I appreciate your call and I'm
[2:08:26.520 --> 2:08:30.240]  not pooping what you're saying completely because I don't have time to do
[2:08:30.240 --> 2:08:34.240]  that they don't stop Kim trailing because you've sent in a notary of this
[2:08:34.240 --> 2:08:39.080]  stuff or because you put a billion dollar bond on them okay nobody collects on
[2:08:39.080 --> 2:08:42.320]  these bonds it's not real I'm tired of patriots believing it going to present
[2:08:42.320 --> 2:08:46.000]  now we should be notifying government is free humans that we're not their
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:49.880]  slaves and we know they're doing this and take over our counties and cities and
[2:08:49.880 --> 2:08:54.320]  communities and bring these crooks to justice we have the righteous right as
[2:08:54.320 --> 2:08:58.440]  free sentient beings to not be their slaves and their government is a
[2:08:58.440 --> 2:09:02.080]  legitimate I'm just telling you they're gonna ignore whatever paper you file with
[2:09:02.080 --> 2:09:06.840]  them now you do file a vaccine exemption form but that turns your right
[2:09:06.840 --> 2:09:10.800]  into a privilege how do you file an exemption form on something that isn't
[2:09:10.800 --> 2:09:19.160]  even a law now I got a headache I just do this too much Paul in Missouri go
[2:09:19.160 --> 2:09:21.800]  ahead you're on the air no Jeff in Missouri and then Paul in Wisconsin go
[2:09:21.800 --> 2:09:26.720]  ahead Jeff Alex can you hear me yes yeah I'm gonna give you another headache but
[2:09:26.720 --> 2:09:33.860]  I want to try to be nice to you okay you got the wrong information about the
[2:09:33.860 --> 2:09:39.160]  Roman Catholic Church the Pope did not call for world political authority if
[2:09:39.160 --> 2:09:44.880]  you take time to read his encyclical there is no mention of world political
[2:09:44.880 --> 2:09:51.200]  authority that he put in his encyclical number two the Roman Catholic Church is
[2:09:51.200 --> 2:09:56.000]  the only organized religion fighting against eugenics they have been from
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:09:59.880]  the very beginning all right let me stop you and let me continue this may be
[2:09:59.880 --> 2:10:02.880]  the last call because I told the guys they'd be out here about 10 after we're
[2:10:02.880 --> 2:10:08.480]  now there listen we made a few more this is a very in-depth issue just like the
[2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:12.600]  last caller number one I get accused of working for the Catholic Church when I'm
[2:10:12.600 --> 2:10:16.440]  not even Catholic and I'm but I'm not saying Catholics are bad and so there's
[2:10:16.440 --> 2:10:21.200]  that whole crazy kind of Israeli funded operation anybody that criticizes
[2:10:21.200 --> 2:10:25.880]  world government and then you know kind of use a fake conspiracy theory against
[2:10:25.880 --> 2:10:30.680]  you to do that but it is true that Pope John Paul the second did call for a new
[2:10:30.680 --> 2:10:35.760]  world order in Latin he did have that weird group with hundreds of religions
[2:10:35.760 --> 2:10:42.880]  there at the St. Peter's Basilica calling for it I have the clip in Latin my
[2:10:42.880 --> 2:10:47.480]  wife speaks Italian I had her watch it because she lived in Italy for four
[2:10:47.480 --> 2:10:51.160]  years and she said no yeah he's calling for a global political authority a
[2:10:51.160 --> 2:10:58.080]  loving globalization and rat singers called for all sorts of stuff I mean
[2:10:58.080 --> 2:11:07.040]  Pope Benedict so I I do know they speak out against abortion and eugenics so I
[2:11:07.040 --> 2:11:12.240]  do know that's true because I flip around on XM and I've listened to Vatican
[2:11:12.240 --> 2:11:15.560]  radio and every time I listen that's probably like five times they're
[2:11:15.560 --> 2:11:21.040]  speaking out against eugenics so you're right they are doing that but at the same
[2:11:21.040 --> 2:11:25.240]  time they are calling for this other stuff go ahead make a point read the
[2:11:25.240 --> 2:11:32.840]  encyclical don't listen to Reuters okay Reuters are liars they hate the
[2:11:32.840 --> 2:11:40.440]  Catholic Church so are you saying that Pope Benedict did did not call for a
[2:11:40.440 --> 2:11:45.120]  global government that's right there's no mention of it in his encyclical at
[2:11:45.120 --> 2:11:50.880]  all so completely fabricated that why don't you write a blurb for us and we'll
[2:11:50.880 --> 2:11:56.080]  with footnotes and send it to Reuters and infowars.com we'll look into it okay
[2:11:56.080 --> 2:12:01.080]  I appreciate it thanks so much thank you I appreciate your call you know we got
[2:12:01.080 --> 2:12:05.160]  Paul Wisconsin Tom Ronnie Rob ed you know what the crew is always nice it
[2:12:05.160 --> 2:12:07.880]  comes in around Sundays but I'm gonna leave it up to them guys we take two
[2:12:07.880 --> 2:12:12.560]  more calls or end it now I'm gonna leave it up to more okay we'll talk to we'll
[2:12:12.560 --> 2:12:19.080]  talk to Paul in Wisconsin go ahead Alex I was wondering if you were aware that
[2:12:19.080 --> 2:12:26.520]  Clifford Carnacom found in his samples he found a freeze-dried red blood cells
[2:12:26.520 --> 2:12:32.880]  you know defecated Erythrocell sir sir Austin did test and found it I played
[2:12:32.880 --> 2:12:38.960]  mainstream newscast where state health department in Washington state tested it
[2:12:38.960 --> 2:12:43.880]  and it was white blood cells yes there's biological there's chemical they you
[2:12:43.880 --> 2:12:48.200]  know whole police stations get sick from this stuff this is real they are
[2:12:48.200 --> 2:12:55.040]  spraying us constantly the perfect vehicle for a bio weapon yeah and most
[2:12:55.040 --> 2:12:59.040]  these weapons are binary meaning they give you part of the weapon now then
[2:12:59.040 --> 2:13:02.800]  they have the antidote for they give you the second part later they are doing
[2:13:02.800 --> 2:13:08.800]  sir they admit my film in game tens of thousands of admitted tests that killed
[2:13:08.800 --> 2:13:13.920]  Americans it's all for eugenics these people are absolutely out of control and
[2:13:13.920 --> 2:13:19.400]  how do you get the public to care about this instead of Michael Jackson Alex
[2:13:19.400 --> 2:13:24.840]  could I just read you a list I got for Clifford Carnacom site yeah by the way
[2:13:24.840 --> 2:13:27.880]  I've told my producer

[2:13:37.320 --> 2:13:46.960]  copper iron lead magnesium manganese nickel potassium silicon sodium
[2:13:46.960 --> 2:13:53.160]  strontium and yeah I said it strontium it's strontium and van diem and zinc
[2:13:53.160 --> 2:13:58.440]  that's what's in the air that's all I have to say we love you Alex have a
[2:13:58.440 --> 2:14:04.080]  nice afternoon God bless you brother yeah it's we called Carnacom about a
[2:14:04.080 --> 2:14:07.920]  year ago and he said I'll come on in a month I'm finishing a project right now

[2:14:31.680 --> 2:14:35.880]  and all this it's not going on it's not a terraforming project that happens to
[2:14:35.880 --> 2:14:40.240]  also be toxic to reproductive organs and then oh to save the earth we want to
[2:14:40.240 --> 2:14:47.280]  spray you with exactly what the kooks said that we were spraying them with last
[2:14:47.280 --> 2:14:51.560]  call and I'm sorry to Ronnie and Rob and Ed but we got time for Tom in Florida
[2:14:51.560 --> 2:14:58.760]  and that's it Tom you're on the air worldwide hey man hey buddy I got one
[2:14:58.760 --> 2:15:04.720]  thing to say is a perfect introduction to what I'm saying the only thing the
[2:15:04.720 --> 2:15:11.600]  only element that there is that can buy to every other element is oxygen in
[2:15:11.600 --> 2:15:18.560]  medicinal use of oxygen Nikola Tesla invented the first machine ozone
[2:15:18.560 --> 2:15:25.880]  machine back in 1890 from a digital use yeah oxygen is better than than than
[2:15:25.880 --> 2:15:30.200]  than than silver solution it's better than antibiotics it eats through steel
[2:15:30.200 --> 2:15:34.040]  and we're these awesome creatures that live in a high-radiation environment
[2:15:34.040 --> 2:15:39.360]  right up against the Sun that breathe a gas that'll eat steel and I'm surprised
[2:15:39.360 --> 2:15:42.760]  they haven't said it's toxic needs to be banned but they're already trying to
[2:15:42.760 --> 2:15:49.720]  ban what plants breathe carbon dioxide it's oxygen all right yeah it's oxygen
[2:15:49.720 --> 2:15:57.560]  in the bioactive form there's a video out from Canada oxygen the politics of
[2:15:57.560 --> 2:16:01.600]  medicine those are the politics of medicine it is points out there's a
[2:16:01.600 --> 2:16:05.800]  clinic in Germany that's a conspiracy theory oxygen hold on oxygen isn't good
[2:16:05.800 --> 2:16:10.200]  I mean I do breathe it doesn't make me live but it's it's evil and we need it
[2:16:10.200 --> 2:16:16.160]  we need it in fact there is some talk now it's not it's not carbon dioxide it's
[2:16:16.160 --> 2:16:21.160]  polluting the earth it's a lack of oxygen sir I was being sarcastic I know no
[2:16:21.160 --> 2:16:25.080]  no I mean we need the carbon cycle is sunlight water carbon dioxide and
[2:16:25.080 --> 2:16:29.560]  oxygen all four are needed for life but there is some talk now about restricting
[2:16:29.560 --> 2:16:34.000]  oxygen as well they're now saying oxygen may be bad I always joked about that and
[2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:41.480]  we're gonna be the conspiracy cooks we believe oxygen is good 90 1890 he had a
[2:16:41.480 --> 2:16:45.160]  cure for everything well I know oxygen is really great and I appreciate your
[2:16:45.160 --> 2:16:49.240]  call anytime I hear cure for everything you got to look out but oxygen is really
[2:16:49.240 --> 2:16:55.160]  important animals do breathe it animal life does live off of it I know that's a
[2:16:55.160 --> 2:16:59.960]  conspiracy theory and shocking to some but carbon dioxide and oxygen are good
[2:16:59.960 --> 2:17:04.360]  that was two hours and 18 minutes of transmission today great job with the
