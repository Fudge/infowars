[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:32.080]  he told the London Guardian two weeks ago that the NSA spy grid is about the
[00:32.080 --> 00:38.240]  totalitarian oppression and quote total control William Benny most high-level
[00:38.240 --> 00:44.080]  NSA whistleblower in history will be joining us coming up in at the second
[00:44.080 --> 00:49.800]  hour today I want to discipline myself and give you a lot of the headlines
[00:49.800 --> 00:55.000]  today and go over some of the news but open the phones up to discuss several
[00:55.000 --> 01:01.040]  issues obviously we'll break down the latest on the imploded border but I
[01:01.040 --> 01:07.720]  really want to get into the impeachment the Democrats for the last few years have
[01:07.720 --> 01:14.000]  been raising money my dad for some reason gets Democrat and White House
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.560]  emails even though he's not a Democrat he's been getting them for a long time
[01:19.560 --> 01:24.160]  I guess since my mom one time gave money to some environmental group that
[01:24.160 --> 01:29.080]  came to her door so we actually know where it all came from the point is he
[01:29.080 --> 01:33.240]  gets these emails and forwards them to me but you've seen them in the news just
[01:33.240 --> 01:39.240]  few days ago they're raising money on the prospect that his impeachment is
[01:39.240 --> 01:43.760]  imminent and you've got Pat Buchanan and others a few weeks ago saying don't
[01:43.760 --> 01:49.360]  impeach Obama because if you try to impeach him it'll make him a martyr
[01:49.360 --> 01:53.400]  politically and then that will actually boost his approval ratings and won't
[01:53.400 --> 01:58.320]  cause a Republican landslide and you know what that may be true that may be
[01:58.320 --> 02:04.640]  true all I know is the country may not make it another two years and you've
[02:04.640 --> 02:11.680]  got to prosecute crime or it sets the precedent that the sky's the limit and
[02:11.680 --> 02:15.840]  I've talked about this a lot I mean this is 101 and criminology and law
[02:15.840 --> 02:20.880]  everybody knows this I'm stating the obvious but they already gotten to the
[02:20.880 --> 02:26.760]  point of the sky being the limit they're already heavy legals protesting with no
[02:26.760 --> 02:32.240]  fear of arrest in front of the White House demanding more and demanding more
[02:32.240 --> 02:37.440]  benefits and it just shows what a joke this country is that veterans can't get
[02:37.440 --> 02:42.960]  healthcare and are put on death list death panel list to be denied care which
[02:42.960 --> 02:47.360]  is a death sentence for brain tumors you name it totally operable lung cancer you
[02:47.360 --> 02:53.640]  name it and the illegals can march in at any city run or county run or private
[02:53.640 --> 02:57.920]  charity hospital and get the healthcare and it's not that I'm even against these
[02:57.920 --> 03:02.000]  individual people they're all mad and angry and really feel like from the
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.360]  media they deserve everything got here from Guatemala a month ago you should
[03:06.360 --> 03:09.280]  get everything free you're here from China a month ago she had everything
[03:09.280 --> 03:13.680]  free you're here from Romania or Turkey a month ago you should get everything
[03:13.680 --> 03:20.680]  free and that's just not the case obviously it's the political class
[03:20.680 --> 03:27.240]  creating a new form of slavery where they get 51% to vote through the
[03:27.240 --> 03:32.800]  governmental taxation system to rob the other 49 and you know I'm not a big fan
[03:32.800 --> 03:38.280]  of Mitt Romney but when he got recorded a fundraiser saying look 47.8%
[03:38.280 --> 03:45.120]  or whatever the number was that was 47.8% don't care what you say or what you
[03:45.120 --> 03:49.480]  do they're gonna vote Democrat they're gonna vote to expand socialism because
[03:49.480 --> 03:56.800]  they are on the dole and he got criticized for quote attacking the 47%
[03:56.800 --> 04:01.600]  there are a hundred plus million people hundred one million people on federal
[04:01.600 --> 04:05.560]  welfare every time I mention that number people don't believe me that that's
[04:05.560 --> 04:10.840]  mainstream news just type in over a hundred million people are on federal
[04:10.840 --> 04:16.600]  welfare that number is growing you've got over 52% now you know just a few
[04:16.600 --> 04:20.200]  years ago it was 47% the last number I saw from the
[04:20.200 --> 04:25.560]  government accounting office GAO governmental accounting office was it's
[04:25.560 --> 04:33.040]  52% now our government dependent so that's why the system is so arrogant
[04:33.040 --> 04:37.880]  now and we can use the quote from aliens game over man because if we don't
[04:37.880 --> 04:43.040]  turn it around very quickly you can stick a fork in it we're done there'll
[04:43.040 --> 04:47.120]  still be some trench warfare politically and groups trying to get
[04:47.120 --> 04:52.960]  together to defend themselves but we're gonna go from individual politics into
[04:52.960 --> 04:58.560]  group gang politics very very quickly stay with us we're breaking it down

[09:44.600 --> 09:52.400]  but I personally not once not twice but three times have been in Washington DC
[09:52.400 --> 09:59.320]  making my own films being in a Discovery Channel TV show and being in a
[09:59.320 --> 10:04.720]  independent film channel TV show three times and I have been 200 yards from the
[10:04.720 --> 10:10.880]  Washington Monument on the grass videotaping the monument and had
[10:10.880 --> 10:15.160]  security guards and police come over and say we will arrest you if you videotape
[10:15.160 --> 10:20.080]  you have to have a permit and then Discovery Channel and the rest of them
[10:20.080 --> 10:25.760]  would say there is no permits issued in DC for public commons and they said hey
[10:25.760 --> 10:32.760]  you want to go to jail if you go down to the White House within 200 yards of it
[10:32.760 --> 10:37.280]  in the park across the street and start taking photos secret service on bicycles
[10:37.280 --> 10:42.960]  just jump off run up bow up to you and say stop videotaping or taking photos
[10:42.960 --> 10:46.080]  or we'll arrest you and the first time this happened I thought they were
[10:46.080 --> 10:51.200]  messing with me and I quit videotaping just to see what was happening and they
[10:51.200 --> 10:59.640]  ran over to school kids with their midwestern parents right out of
[10:59.640 --> 11:05.160]  Lampoon's vacation national Lampoon's and would get in their face and they
[11:05.160 --> 11:08.360]  would grovel and fear and run off and they would just do it to family after
[11:08.360 --> 11:13.800]  family because the message is you're scum if you're an American citizen roll
[11:13.800 --> 11:19.720]  over and learn to be a prisoner this is total prisoner induction the TSA all of
[11:19.720 --> 11:25.880]  it so remember with the backdrop of all this news we're gonna cover today that
[11:25.880 --> 11:30.440]  thousands of illegal aliens arrogantly the videos are just so arrogant
[11:30.440 --> 11:35.240]  stomping around like they've just been robbed or their children have been
[11:35.240 --> 11:43.240]  killed demanding total instant legalization and more welfare just
[11:43.240 --> 11:48.120]  stomping around and and waving all the flags of the Democratic Party in that
[11:48.120 --> 11:55.560]  whole agenda and they are angry and they want it all and they want it now but
[11:55.560 --> 12:05.280]  American citizens who try to show up and shoot video of the White House as if
[12:05.280 --> 12:09.280]  you can't get it from Google Streets anywhere else literally have secret
[12:09.280 --> 12:16.560]  service follow them around and and then we were walking around DC I think we
[12:16.560 --> 12:21.880]  have footage of this we've aired it before four or five years ago and the
[12:21.880 --> 12:27.120]  secret service in plain clothes on bicycles was following us when we were
[12:27.120 --> 12:32.200]  800 to a thousand yards away just walking down the street and they would
[12:32.200 --> 12:35.600]  stop behind bus stops and they were chewing gum and looking at us in their
[12:35.600 --> 12:41.680]  dark sunglasses I mean it's all just mental illness folks it's tyranny
[12:41.680 --> 12:56.560]  dressed up like it's legitimate and like it's keeping somebody safe that's
[12:56.560 --> 13:01.480]  folks protesting out front the White House where if you don't have a permit
[13:01.480 --> 13:04.880]  to demonstrate which they don't issue and you're a tea party group you get a
[13:04.880 --> 13:14.600]  rusted and again it's the discrimination of the fact that there's no
[13:14.600 --> 13:20.440]  basic freedom in this country according to the government the freedoms alive in
[13:20.440 --> 13:24.560]  our hearts and minds and it's alive when we exercise it but they would have us
[13:24.560 --> 13:31.640]  believe that we have absolutely no rights last night I watched Jack Ryan
[13:31.640 --> 13:43.360]  shadow recruit and I like the actors that are in the film but it was
[13:43.360 --> 13:48.680]  unwatchable and I knew how it was gonna end and here's a film that came out a
[13:48.680 --> 13:55.200]  year ago pre-planned for the current Russia crisis to sell war with Russia
[13:55.200 --> 14:00.160]  and even if you hate Russia and want war for them the movies roll out on TV
[14:00.160 --> 14:06.320]  dramas sitcoms films comic books telling you who the next enemy is right
[14:06.320 --> 14:13.920]  before it happens they had Tom Clancy's you know video game come out the year
[14:13.920 --> 14:17.800]  before the Georgia conflict with the exact same conflict unfolding because
[14:17.800 --> 14:22.520]  it's all pre-planned so people are then comfortable with Russia being the enemy
[14:22.520 --> 14:28.120]  now because it was already pre-programmed years before that the
[14:28.120 --> 14:35.640]  Cold War is back on it's scripted is my point and the larger issue is the
[14:35.640 --> 14:40.160]  globalists are going after any stable country in the Middle East any secular
[14:40.160 --> 14:44.600]  government the Middle East any Christian supporting government the Middle
[14:44.600 --> 14:49.360]  East they're going after Russia that's trying to stabilize itself and stabilize
[14:49.360 --> 14:55.000]  Eastern Europe when the EU wants to suck Eastern Europe dry and exploit it and
[14:55.000 --> 15:01.080]  they're going after us the globalists are going after our infrastructure our
[15:01.080 --> 15:08.560]  jobs our families the globalists are moving on every front right now this is
[15:08.560 --> 15:14.120]  a very historical time to be alive and everything they do is basically bad you
[15:14.120 --> 15:20.160]  can debate within the spectrum who's right who's wrong and the politics of
[15:20.160 --> 15:24.320]  any given issue but you have to pull back from Republican and Democratic
[15:24.320 --> 15:29.240]  rhetoric and actually look at who the special interests are and what they want
[15:29.240 --> 15:36.000]  and the larger agenda is for global governance autocratic totalitarianism
[15:36.000 --> 15:41.680]  attacking every institution the family the church you name it not that the
[15:41.680 --> 15:45.160]  church is even good it's been government run for a long time but all
[15:45.160 --> 15:51.320]  institutions are to not just be overtaken they are to be pulled down so that no
[15:51.320 --> 15:57.680]  competing system can exist monetary it doesn't matter it's the opposite of
[15:57.680 --> 16:03.880]  diversity the opposite of choices and through the Democratic Party right now
[16:03.880 --> 16:11.440]  we see the vanguard of the movement class warfare race warfare social division
[16:11.440 --> 16:16.160]  man against woman old against young death panels veterans being kicked off
[16:16.160 --> 16:22.640]  healthcare put on death list and not be given care on record and the media calls
[16:22.640 --> 16:26.160]  it a screw-up it's not a screw-up it's a policy
[16:26.160 --> 16:30.440]  it's not a screw-up on the border like Rick Perry says about Obama it's a
[16:30.440 --> 16:37.760]  deliberate policy people ask why I praise Ted Cruz and Rand Paul they're the
[16:37.760 --> 16:42.320]  only ones that will say it's deliberate because it is the border patrol says it's
[16:42.320 --> 16:46.880]  deliberate and shows proof we go down to the border and show proof we have the
[16:46.880 --> 16:52.400]  facts we're nothing special anybody can say two plus two equals four anybody can
[16:52.400 --> 17:00.120]  try to be decent there is no debating this there is no choice you either join
[17:00.120 --> 17:07.720]  with the evil and be a schmuck be a chump be a sucker be a mark be a mind
[17:07.720 --> 17:12.520]  control cult member or you decide that you're going to resist what's happening
[17:12.520 --> 17:20.880]  it's in your own best interest it's in all our best interest to say no to all of
[17:20.880 --> 17:30.760]  this now folks there's a lot of news here and if we do a document cam shot I
[17:30.760 --> 17:35.920]  can show folks the stacks here we've got the info or stack of news world news
[17:35.920 --> 17:42.760]  science and tech politics economy US news Russia Ukraine border crisis this is
[17:42.760 --> 17:46.280]  all news we've been working on and researching since last night right through
[17:46.280 --> 17:55.000]  this morning and I'm gonna try to get into all of this important news but if
[17:55.000 --> 18:03.320]  you pull back from all of this what is the tie that binds it what is the what
[18:03.320 --> 18:08.040]  is the connecting strand it is the globalist on record that are engineering
[18:08.040 --> 18:13.840]  and steering this whole situation and they are our enemies they have made a
[18:13.840 --> 18:18.600]  conscious decision to wreck civilization to consolidate power to dumb
[18:18.600 --> 18:22.520]  populations down to poison populations with propaganda and with physical
[18:22.520 --> 18:32.120]  toxins this is a psychotronic positronic technotronic system of total
[18:32.120 --> 18:38.920]  domination and I don't tell you that to demoralize you and to make you scared I
[18:38.920 --> 18:44.160]  believe you have courage I believe that when faced with the real adversity you
[18:44.160 --> 18:49.560]  will mobilize against it so many cowards out there in the system misinterpret
[18:49.560 --> 18:56.720]  this radio broadcast and they wrongfully think that I'm fear mongering up here if
[18:56.720 --> 19:01.920]  I wake up at 2 a.m. because I smell smoke and the dogs are barking and the
[19:01.920 --> 19:08.040]  neighbor's house across the street on the hill has fire shooting out of it it is

[24:10.720 --> 24:18.440]  boner rules out impeachment John Boehner and again I want to open the phones up
[24:18.440 --> 24:23.200]  in the next segment to ask you the question I understand what Pat Buchanan
[24:23.200 --> 24:27.200]  saying I know Pat Buchanan personally worked on his campaign three different
[24:27.200 --> 24:34.200]  times I respect Pat Buchanan he's a good paleo conservative libertarian
[24:34.200 --> 24:40.600]  constitutionalist he says don't impeach Obama let libertarian Republicans
[24:40.600 --> 24:46.440]  take over the Republican primaries which they're doing let them get into the
[24:46.440 --> 24:56.320]  state and congressional federal level but the problem is Obama could start new
[24:56.320 --> 25:02.960]  wars during the next two years he could stage a false flag and basically stay
[25:02.960 --> 25:07.960]  in office indefinitely or put a permanent bureaucracy in place via
[25:07.960 --> 25:12.400]  homeland security that transcends his administration and as a bureaucratic
[25:12.400 --> 25:17.160]  dictatorship the economy could completely implode under Obama and he
[25:17.160 --> 25:21.200]  could set the course for socialism and expand the taxation and government
[25:21.200 --> 25:28.000]  control you see how he's already imploded the border extra judicially
[25:28.000 --> 25:34.360]  extra legislatively and is saying he set the sign executive order to restrict
[25:34.360 --> 25:40.680]  the Second Amendment and illegalize the illegals outside of his congressional
[25:40.680 --> 25:46.120]  request he's not going to Congress to get a law passed or even an
[25:46.120 --> 25:55.240]  authorization he's just doing it as a fiat dictator not as a dictator who will
[25:55.240 --> 26:00.800]  be permanent and stay in office but as a operating dictator for all intents and
[26:00.800 --> 26:08.400]  purposes and more and more congressmen and senators are now saying that because
[26:08.400 --> 26:13.920]  that's what's happening if we got a dictator would we notice not since
[26:13.920 --> 26:20.080]  Lincoln have we seen a president operate like this outside of Congress and
[26:20.080 --> 26:25.440]  that was the Civil War last time and notice he's been billed by the Democrats
[26:25.440 --> 26:31.840]  when he first ran back in 2007 2008 as the second coming of Lincoln he would
[26:31.840 --> 26:37.840]  crush the better clingers that clung to their Bibles and their guns and so
[26:37.840 --> 26:43.200]  Boehner has come out the Washington Times is reporting as he did a month ago
[26:43.200 --> 26:50.800]  and he has ruled out impeachment he says it's a scam started by Democrats and I
[26:50.800 --> 26:55.800]  agree that it is a scam going on for several years by the Democrats to say
[26:55.800 --> 27:04.360]  impeachment is imminent we need to raise money for him right now or or or he
[27:04.360 --> 27:08.800]  will reverse you know the Republicans in an impeachment will reverse the wonders
[27:08.800 --> 27:14.160]  of Obamacare and they will reverse the wonders of everything else that's been
[27:14.160 --> 27:18.960]  done the wondrous death panels the wondrous losing your doctor and having
[27:18.960 --> 27:24.440]  your health plan go up in price and the wondrous payroll tax on poor people and
[27:24.440 --> 27:29.160]  the wondrous open borders and the wondrous putting our military under you
[27:29.160 --> 27:33.920]  in control and the wondrous common core teaching 2 plus 2 equals 5 and the
[27:33.920 --> 27:40.600]  wondrous black plague and tuberculosis and flesh-eating bacteria and mites and
[27:40.600 --> 27:45.200]  pinworms and just everything spreading across the country right now as we
[27:45.200 --> 27:50.840]  collapse into a third-world nation the wondrous liver flukes showing up in
[27:50.840 --> 27:55.040]  California and water supplies that were formerly not even in Central America
[27:55.040 --> 28:03.080]  they were in South America and so you can look at that and say do you play
[28:03.080 --> 28:06.840]  politics and hope a bunch of libertarians get elected which is starting to
[28:06.840 --> 28:11.880]  happen and then reverse everything that the Democrats with their Republican
[28:11.880 --> 28:20.000]  blue blood neocon cohorts have engaged in do you let Obama keep operating for
[28:20.000 --> 28:25.440]  another two years when every week he tops his last outrage my gut tells me
[28:25.440 --> 28:29.840]  absolutely not you don't play politics with us we've done this too long he will
[28:29.840 --> 28:34.720]  pardon himself he will pardon everybody else around him impeachment
[28:34.720 --> 28:38.200]  removing him from office is the only thing that stops him from being able
[28:38.200 --> 28:43.880]  to do that and you send a message to the political criminal class that the
[28:43.880 --> 28:47.920]  games are over and then you use that impeachment process to empower the
[28:47.920 --> 28:53.400]  states to create a new coalition of states to organize and to elect pro
[28:53.400 --> 28:59.120]  constitution pro-liberty American restoration emergency party people I
[28:59.120 --> 29:03.200]  mean you call it the emergency party and if Democrats want to join it that's
[29:03.200 --> 29:07.000]  fine we've got a right to country we don't want to wreck it and scuttle it
[29:07.000 --> 29:12.560]  under cloward and piven and agenda 21 so they can take over we don't want to go
[29:12.560 --> 29:17.920]  to a conquest government a total collapse government people standing in line for
[29:17.920 --> 29:22.240]  their welfare like the old Soviet Union that's the model of state control they
[29:22.240 --> 29:27.920]  admit they're going for and if the political class isn't scared into
[29:27.920 --> 29:31.600]  submission they're going to go ahead with it which you see them doing now I

[33:46.960 --> 33:55.240]  up but finishing up the point I was getting to in the last segment this
[33:55.240 --> 34:02.720]  country is literally marinated in propaganda and disinformation any major
[34:02.720 --> 34:10.200]  sitcom or drama or movie I watch is just full of anti-male anti-gun anti-family
[34:10.200 --> 34:17.680]  garbage or when there is a good male role model like in jack ryan shadow
[34:17.680 --> 34:26.080]  recruit that I watched on DVD last night that came out about a year ago if
[34:26.080 --> 34:32.920]  there is a positive male role model he works for the CIA and it's so sexy and
[34:32.920 --> 34:38.000]  it's so cool and his wife his girlfriend just has no idea you know how
[34:38.000 --> 34:45.960]  awesome he is and he's implanted inside the financial sector and there's a
[34:45.960 --> 34:51.160]  secret war going on with Russia they're the new enemy again all of this being
[34:51.160 --> 34:55.520]  pre-prepared all of this being rolled out and then at the end he's done a good
[34:55.520 --> 35:02.680]  job and he's a good boy scout they say so he gets to go in and he gets to meet
[35:02.680 --> 35:08.600]  with the president and he walks into the room and meets the president and it's
[35:08.600 --> 35:15.440]  like he's died and gone to heaven he's gone across the pearly gates and the
[35:15.440 --> 35:21.400]  average person watching this literally thinks that the only thing better than
[35:21.400 --> 35:24.680]  winning an Oscar the only thing better than winning a gold medal at the
[35:24.680 --> 35:29.160]  Olympics the only thing better than inventing the cure to cancer is to meet
[35:29.160 --> 35:34.280]  with the president and that's what the big airplanes are about in the red
[35:34.280 --> 35:39.960]  carpets and the shutting down the highways is this big illusion that the
[35:39.960 --> 35:46.400]  president runs something sure there have been a few presidents like Nixon or
[35:46.400 --> 35:50.280]  Kennedy that tried to run things and you saw what happened to them whether they
[35:50.280 --> 35:56.200]  were good or bad they were removed by the special interest presidents are
[35:56.200 --> 36:05.520]  puppets and the CIA is a giant sprawling bureaucracy involved in every evil
[36:05.520 --> 36:15.280]  under the Sun on record it's declassified on record 1997 CIA inspector
[36:15.280 --> 36:19.480]  general hearings in Congress that they ship in the majority of the narcotics
[36:19.480 --> 36:24.440]  and launder the money when a cop wants to search your car randomly you say well
[36:24.440 --> 36:28.160]  the big banks want the drug money yeah I know but I'm asking what's in your car
[36:28.160 --> 36:32.960]  see it's all a fraud the illegals can protest in front of the White House but
[36:32.960 --> 36:39.720]  veterans get arrested if they do rolling Thunder motorcycle group tries to go up
[36:39.720 --> 36:45.160]  there they get arrested the illegals do the illegals get to walk through TSA you
[36:45.160 --> 36:51.920]  don't the big banks get to launder the money and get to be tax exempt and
[36:51.920 --> 36:56.440]  Google gets to be tax exempt and General Electric gets to be tax exempt you
[36:56.440 --> 37:01.880]  don't you're making ten dollars an hour you're not exempt from Obamacare and the
[37:01.880 --> 37:08.960]  payroll tax and the establishment would say well they're poor and they're dumb
[37:08.960 --> 37:13.880]  because they were meant to be poor and dumb and the world needs ditch diggers
[37:13.880 --> 37:23.080]  too to quote judge schmales from caddy shack well I don't think that you deserve
[37:23.080 --> 37:27.640]  to be lied to and be run over and there's nothing sadder than a brainwashed
[37:27.640 --> 37:32.480]  minion of this system who has created this weird little sick relationship with
[37:32.480 --> 37:37.720]  the president like he's their imaginary friend and he's there guarding them when
[37:37.720 --> 37:46.960]  all he is is a corporate governance franchise pitchman president of Coca
[37:46.960 --> 37:52.960]  Cola what do presidents do presidents of companies go and play golf and go cut
[37:52.960 --> 37:58.560]  red ribbons and they go hang out with the mayor of cities when they come visit
[37:58.560 --> 38:08.200]  and do public relations what is the CEO do they run the company and the CEO of
[38:08.200 --> 38:14.840]  this country is a roundtable of the big six banks and under them big pharma and
[38:14.840 --> 38:21.680]  the military industrial complex and they are 30 to 40 years advanced of us in
[38:21.680 --> 38:28.760]  technology and have now created technological breakaway civilization and
[38:28.760 --> 38:34.000]  what we know about it is that it's 30 to 40 years advanced they can already
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.400]  predict the future and they've decided that we are to be eliminated and have
[38:38.400 --> 38:45.440]  already set up the plan to carry out the incremental phased-in actuary to end
[38:45.440 --> 38:54.320]  humanity as we know it and so I'm just here saying hey do you want to be wiped
[38:54.320 --> 38:58.800]  out you like your kids going into puberty at 7 instead of 14 something's wrong
[38:58.800 --> 39:03.960]  game over you like cancer rates being 3-4 thousand percent what they were just
[39:03.960 --> 39:11.520]  30 years ago diabetes same thing deformities brain disorders off the
[39:11.520 --> 39:18.440]  charts game over man game over game over I can sit here and cover all these
[39:18.440 --> 39:23.880]  stacks of news folks and make it real interesting for you but the reason this
[39:23.880 --> 39:27.600]  is all happening is because the establishment has decided that you
[39:27.600 --> 39:31.440]  aren't going to be existing and your children aren't going to be existing
[39:31.440 --> 39:37.400]  down the road but first they've got to implode society so we come to them with
[39:37.400 --> 39:45.440]  hat in hand and we'll do anything they say to get food and water and that's why
[39:45.440 --> 39:55.960]  I can drive down I-35 and mainly see good-looking clean-cut families pulled
[39:55.960 --> 40:00.320]  over with cops searching their cars because that's who the cops have been
[40:00.320 --> 40:09.480]  ordered to search their order to search each day a different profile while the
[40:09.480 --> 40:13.800]  border is wide open and I literally every time I see it want to pull over and
[40:13.800 --> 40:17.480]  go get in the cops face who's in a military stance walk around their
[40:17.480 --> 40:25.920]  uniform with a scared family it's a joke it's a joke that cop is eating GMO that
[40:25.920 --> 40:30.640]  cop is full of poison his kids probably can't even talk a large percentage of
[40:30.640 --> 40:32.960]  the time
[40:36.680 --> 40:41.960]  but I was over in England a year and a half ago at Bilderberg
[40:45.880 --> 40:50.960]  there were just at one point like 50 British police there and a lot of them
[40:50.960 --> 40:54.560]  turned outward listeners and knew what was going on they were some of the most
[40:54.560 --> 40:58.080]  awake police I've ever run into they had them from a whole bunch of different
[40:58.080 --> 41:04.640]  cities and from London up there for the event hundreds of them but a few of them
[41:04.640 --> 41:08.480]  would try to act imperious and bug their eyes out at me and I'd walk right over
[41:08.480 --> 41:11.840]  to them and I'd say I bet you got family members that aren't even that old
[41:11.840 --> 41:15.720]  Donna cancer right now and they go what were you saying that how do you know
[41:15.720 --> 41:20.840]  that and I literally would go give me that bag and I would pull out the London
[41:20.840 --> 41:25.400]  Independent that had a cover story about half of Britain's will have cancer by
[41:25.400 --> 41:31.560]  2025 and I said you're being murdered you work for a system murdering you and
[41:31.560 --> 41:36.080]  your family and I go and if you laugh now you won't be laughing later and those
[41:36.080 --> 41:39.240]  cops would look completely freaked out and we just start freak you know why
[41:39.240 --> 41:43.640]  because they knew folks they knew it was all a big joke they were right there
[41:43.640 --> 41:47.680]  until the robots roll out to up to control the population and then they're
[41:47.680 --> 41:52.440]  done you've already been given time-released chemicals and
[41:52.440 --> 41:59.400]  biologicals to kill you and your family all of us are walking dead already I
[41:59.400 --> 42:03.840]  don't know how else I'm supposed to explain this to you remember Dr. Eric
[42:03.840 --> 42:09.360]  Pionk at the University of Texas who cryptically on his own website talks
[42:09.360 --> 42:14.480]  about Lucifer and dresses up in druidic robes I'm not kidding last time I
[42:14.480 --> 42:20.320]  checked it was still up on a side it's in my film in game and Dr. Eric Pionka
[42:20.320 --> 42:26.240]  said it's very sad that my family's ready it will come soon the airborne
[42:26.240 --> 42:33.840]  Ebola it will kill 90% of us and it will be good I'm ready to die and when he
[42:33.840 --> 42:38.680]  gave a speech the Texas Academy of Sciences it was in the news that there
[42:38.680 --> 42:46.800]  was a standing three-minute ovation with tears rolling down their faces as the
[42:46.800 --> 42:52.560]  professors cried as he projected on a giant screen behind him skulls with a
[42:52.560 --> 43:02.920]  red filter it was a rapture of evil devil worshipping death and of course
[43:02.920 --> 43:07.360]  even if you don't believe in the devil it's the Carl Jung archetype the people
[43:07.360 --> 43:12.560]  there don't know why they get so excited celebrating the death of humanity
[43:12.560 --> 43:17.600]  but it's the power trip and they've already given up everything that they
[43:17.600 --> 43:22.360]  were and they've sold out to evil and to the globalist plan and to the power
[43:22.360 --> 43:27.320]  trip that they're the elite and they get a thrill like a moth flying into a bug
[43:27.320 --> 43:39.320]  zapper that they are part of this operation William Benning the big NSA
[43:39.320 --> 43:42.640]  whistleblower bigger than Snowden is scheduled to be joining us coming up in
[43:42.640 --> 43:52.720]  the next hour he said the ultimate goal the NSA is total population control he
[43:52.720 --> 44:02.960]  said it is a move towards totalitarianism by a totalitarian mentality you see the
[44:02.960 --> 44:07.320]  reason they've got the jump on us is that even though we know about all the
[44:07.320 --> 44:10.200]  secret medical experiments killing little kids and the rest of it and
[44:10.200 --> 44:13.400]  shooting people up with syphilis and the list goes on and on the atomic
[44:13.400 --> 44:18.760]  soldiers nerve-gassing our own trips forced abortions major hospitals
[44:18.760 --> 44:23.040]  killing people with their organs coast to coast still people have
[44:23.040 --> 44:28.240]  compartmentalized it and they feel so powerless hearing all of this they
[44:28.240 --> 44:34.840]  don't want to believe it's actually happening but it is happening the
[44:34.840 --> 44:43.120]  numbers don't lie and so if you want to be inducted into being a prisoner if you
[44:43.120 --> 44:53.200]  want to be inducted into a total tyranny if you want to lie to yourself about
[44:53.200 --> 44:57.000]  this going on or you feel so powerless you don't think you can do anything to
[44:57.000 --> 45:01.320]  stop it at least get out of our way those of us that want to survive and
[45:01.320 --> 45:06.080]  those of us that don't want to sign on to this nightmare because the enemy will
[45:06.080 --> 45:11.760]  fall on their strength they will fall on the fact that it is so over the top and
[45:11.760 --> 45:16.440]  they think people coming face to face with this will rationalize it or deny
[45:16.440 --> 45:24.160]  it and won't deal with it but the truth is historically no matter how high tech
[45:24.160 --> 45:29.320]  their mind control is people will finally wake up in the final equation and we
[45:29.320 --> 45:35.040]  will turn the tables on these people because they're going to do everything
[45:35.040 --> 45:39.120]  we've talked about here today and if we're able to back them off and slow
[45:39.120 --> 45:44.240]  them down that's good but they have every intention of trying to carry the
[45:44.240 --> 45:50.040]  sound and hasn't enough of their plan to come to fruition for all of you out
[45:50.040 --> 45:59.360]  there now to know it's really as bad as I say it is how much worse does it have
[45:59.360 --> 46:05.160]  to get look at these headlines illegals protest outside White House no fear of
[46:05.160 --> 46:09.760]  arrest senator sessions Americans will not accept nullification of their laws
[46:09.760 --> 46:21.920]  Perry what we're doing is a crime I like the fact that that's being said how
[46:21.920 --> 46:26.080]  many more kids are going to be put on the top of frames half a million a million
[46:26.080 --> 46:32.640]  five million so I've got to say this Rick Perry is now doing what I said he
[46:32.640 --> 46:36.600]  should do he's saying it is a premeditated crime and so we salute Rick
[46:36.600 --> 46:43.120]  Perry I don't just want to attack Rick Perry for no reason I want him to say
[46:43.120 --> 46:48.040]  what's happening like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul I want us to face what's happened
[46:48.040 --> 46:53.920]  that's the only way to stop this and again just the issue of the collapsing
[46:53.920 --> 46:59.880]  border is only part of a larger program let's go back to the headlines
[46:59.880 --> 47:07.680]  Democrats legalization will help reduce the deficit that's a quote from C-Span
[47:07.680 --> 47:14.240]  we're gonna play that later I've been reporting on this for months but now
[47:14.240 --> 47:20.040]  it's hitting the news makes $7,000 per month it's between $6,000 and $8,000 the
[47:20.040 --> 47:25.080]  ads we've seen fostering adult illegals see there's a new scam the feds are
[47:25.080 --> 47:32.680]  using the federal CPS money the social worker money to let Democrats warehouse
[47:32.680 --> 47:40.040]  at their homes illegals and make money off of it $7,000 a month to keep three
[47:40.040 --> 47:45.440]  people at your house you stick them in one room with some mattresses and feed
[47:45.440 --> 47:55.040]  them what's that cost $1,000 $2,000 and you make $5,000 you see how
[47:55.040 --> 47:58.720]  they're taking the economy and paying their people that's how they're taking
[47:58.720 --> 48:03.800]  over this is organized crime this is racketeering by the definition
[48:03.800 --> 48:10.880]  residents revolt what we see is an invasion deliberate invasion DFW
[48:10.880 --> 48:16.520]  Dallas CBS Jerry Brown makes religious appeal to open borders manipulating
[48:16.520 --> 48:21.680]  Christians working with the 501c3 state-run churches right-wing Baptist
[48:21.680 --> 48:29.640]  churches left-wing Catholic churches they're all state-run folks and the
[48:29.640 --> 48:33.320]  Republican leadership is doing nothing we're gonna come back in this segment the
[48:33.320 --> 48:39.440]  next and talk to Mike Shelby Andrew John and Mike and others Mick and others
[48:39.440 --> 48:46.200]  to get your take on impeachment look I get the fact that Obama is totally
[48:46.200 --> 48:50.880]  unpopular Hillary went on CNN and bad Maldeman said she likes George W. Bush
[48:50.880 --> 48:56.680]  yesterday that's her positioning to run for president and CNN didn't even call
[48:56.680 --> 49:00.880]  her on it the media is like well she's pretty conservative I heard her saying
[49:00.880 --> 49:08.280]  the open borders is wrong yesterday she runs Obama are you gonna fall for that
[49:08.280 --> 49:14.520]  trick folks and again Rick Perry I don't trust Rick Perry but I said I would
[49:14.520 --> 49:18.280]  endorse what he's saying and knowing if he started calling it criminal and
[49:18.280 --> 49:22.480]  deliberate that's an important thing to do because it is deliberate it's
[49:22.480 --> 49:27.520]  premeditated big difference we can't just let him play dumb anymore you can
[49:27.520 --> 49:31.240]  let Rick Perry play dumb and I know our listeners are contacting Rick Perry good
[49:31.240 --> 49:36.280]  job now Rick you need to load these people up on buses and start driving
[49:36.280 --> 49:39.440]  them to the Mexican border and demanding they take them because they're the ones
[49:39.440 --> 49:44.080]  that gave them passage you got to stop them at the border legally to prove they
[49:44.080 --> 49:48.240]  came out of Mexico because under international law Mexico's got to take
[49:48.240 --> 49:55.040]  them back if they are the last country that they traveled through again folks
[49:55.040 --> 49:58.560]  they know all this the border patrol knows how to stop this they've been

[54:07.040 --> 54:12.520]  illegals will reduce the deficit he was asked about what all the illegals will
[54:12.520 --> 54:16.840]  do to wages and workers well Ross Perot told us what it would do and he told us
[54:16.840 --> 54:21.480]  what naphthen gatt would do he said it would hurt the US and Mexico and it did
[54:21.480 --> 54:26.800]  it did it deindustrialized both countries the long race to the bottom
[54:26.800 --> 54:33.120]  let's go to Van Hollins telling us that the sky is not blue just came from a
[54:33.120 --> 54:38.600]  hearing with the nonpartisan director of the Congressional Budget Office who
[54:38.600 --> 54:43.920]  testified that if you passed the Senate bipartisan bill you will reduce the
[54:43.920 --> 54:47.840]  deficit and increase long-term economic growth the United States I'm afraid I'm
[54:47.840 --> 54:52.760]  gonna and of course that was a larger bill the bunch of other issues in it but
[54:52.760 --> 54:57.200]  he just says that means legalizing everyone will do this some of the
[54:57.200 --> 55:02.600]  headlines up on info wars.com Australian government pushing internet tax to
[55:02.600 --> 55:08.320]  quote pay for NSA style spying they say the tax will be used to spy on you
[55:08.320 --> 55:11.840]  global elite are agitating for open war with Russia

[55:30.960 --> 55:36.080]  some of the news up on info wars.com photos emerge of 10 active militia
[55:36.080 --> 55:41.120]  teams securing the US border but they can't really secure it because if you
[55:41.120 --> 55:44.560]  give them to the feds they just release them I want to keep pointing that out not
[55:44.560 --> 55:48.440]  putting the militia groups down but it's just it's like the National Guard's
[55:48.440 --> 55:55.760]  just delivery boys for the illegals there's another report by Washington's
[55:55.760 --> 56:00.400]  blog all the countries which the US or the globalist have had regime change in
[56:00.400 --> 56:05.680]  Iraq Afghanistan and Libya have descended into brutal chaos now I asked
[56:05.680 --> 56:09.200]  the question in this segment the next ahead of the top NSA whistleblower
[56:09.200 --> 56:14.400]  William Benny joining us I asked the question to impeach or not to impeach
[56:14.400 --> 56:19.320]  that is the question whether it is nobler to sit here and let Obama butcher
[56:19.320 --> 56:23.240]  the country from pillar to post and set the precedent to commit arbitrary
[56:23.240 --> 56:30.080]  racketeering crimes against the Republic or whether we should do the right thing
[56:30.080 --> 56:34.200]  and impeach him because it's called justice to send a message to scare all
[56:34.200 --> 56:38.640]  the globalist out there. Mick in Louisiana you're on the air thanks for
[56:38.640 --> 56:43.920]  holding what's your take on this important question. Yes, thank you Alex. I'd like to
[56:43.920 --> 56:49.200]  point out an unsung hero then I'm gonna give my statement on this impeachment. If you
[56:49.200 --> 57:00.840]  go to Koto Crew C-O-T-O Crew C-R-E-W dot wordpress.com Bob my new hero that's
[57:00.840 --> 57:05.040]  Koto Crew wordpress.com. Sir you got to tell me you got to tell me you're you go
[57:05.040 --> 57:11.840]  ahead. Yes I would love to see impeachment it would be wonderful yes it
[57:11.840 --> 57:18.560]  would arouse the liberal base but more importantly it arouse the disenfranchised
[57:18.560 --> 57:24.160]  angry masses and that's why we're not going to see it. They do not want the
[57:24.160 --> 57:29.200]  power elites do not want to awaken the angry masses because then both parties
[57:29.200 --> 57:33.360]  would be discredited. That's right they don't want to be brought to justice they
[57:33.360 --> 57:37.480]  don't want the whole can of worms to come out just like they went after
[57:37.480 --> 57:42.040]  Clinton for lying about sex instead of Laurel and Hughes missile secrets to the
[57:42.040 --> 57:46.800]  chai comms because the Republicans were involved in that as well. I totally agree
[57:46.800 --> 57:50.280]  with you and look I'm not against people plugging websites it's just giving out
[57:50.280 --> 57:55.840]  web URLs doesn't work you want to give out a headline from the website that
[57:55.840 --> 58:00.880]  originates from that website that's how you plug stuff so so that's the best
[58:00.880 --> 58:04.920]  way for people to do that. Thank you so much great points Mick Shelby real fast
[58:04.920 --> 58:09.760]  to impeach or not to impeach? We absolutely have to impeach him if we
[58:09.760 --> 58:14.680]  want to continue to call ourselves Christians and Americans. Let's see here
[58:14.680 --> 58:19.320]  in his Oakland office he says I do solemnly swear or affirm I will faithfully
[58:19.320 --> 58:22.720]  execute the office of the president of the United States and will best my
[58:22.720 --> 58:25.560]  ability to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[58:25.560 --> 58:29.680]  And in the State of the Union address he says I tend to keep trying but there
[58:29.680 --> 58:33.520]  without courage to help stop more tragedies for business and Americans in
[58:33.520 --> 58:36.560]  our movie theater. Stay there I'm gonna come back and let you finish stay with us
[58:36.560 --> 58:47.120]  we'll be back. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:48.480 --> 58:53.200]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water. I
[58:53.200 --> 58:57.520]  can taste dirt in it. God knows what's in there. These people just sampled City of
[58:57.520 --> 59:01.640]  Austin tap water straight from the faucet. Next we had them try a sample of
[59:01.640 --> 59:06.760]  tap water filtered for the Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system. Now one is better.
[59:06.760 --> 59:10.480]  Tastes like nothing. Yep I know a good water tastes like it's good water. Most
[59:10.480 --> 59:15.680]  tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many
[59:15.680 --> 59:19.280]  others. Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of
[59:19.280 --> 59:23.800]  major health issues including tooth decay, lower IQ, and even cancer. It tastes
[59:23.800 --> 59:28.120]  like you're drinking out of the lake when you're in tap water. The Pro Pure G2.0
[59:28.120 --> 59:32.640]  filtration system removes these deadly substances leaving only fresh tasting
[59:32.640 --> 59:37.840]  deliciously clean water. This is very tasty. It's good water. Refreshing. It's good. Go

[59:56.360 --> 59:59.320]  Radio Network.
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:12.160]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:19.680]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network. And now live from Austin, Texas
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:26.800]  Alex Jones. Obama started out in his administration saying I can't bypass
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:30.920]  Congress but I sure wish I could too. I'm thinking about bypassing Congress too.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:37.320]  Do you want me to bypass Congress? Yes, yes, yes. And so they're just setting a
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:40.840]  precedent for an arbitrary executive. Shelby what was your other point to
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:46.640]  impeach or not to impeach? Boehner says no way. It's a democratic scam. Well they
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:50.400]  are lying and saying impeachment is imminent. So what Boehner is saying is
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:57.480]  true to a point. But impeachment should be on the table and I think we should go
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:03.720]  ahead with it. Well not true because otherwise we we give our implied consent
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:10.720]  with our silence. And therefore when he made that oath and made a firm in
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:16.920]  oath, it's something that he made a promise that he meant not to fulfill. That
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:21.680]  makes what is the definition of perjury. Therefore there is a case to be made
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:26.160]  that he has committed perjury in his statements and when he made the police
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:29.160]  for that oath. Well I mean the big impeachment issue is he's failed to
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:33.600]  execute his duties. Securing the border is paramount amongst us for the
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:37.920]  president. Thank you for the call. Let's talk to John in Utah. You're on the air.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:45.440]  Go ahead. Hello Alex. I say impeach. Absolutely impeach. The president.
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:49.120]  Probably the vice president but stick with the president. And I think we
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:53.440]  should impeach Boehner. And Boehner because he's holding this up. That's
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:58.840]  right. And I constantly I've talked to my own congressman several times about
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:03.920]  this. His chief of staff says well Boehner is sort of handicapped because
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:09.360]  he has eastern liberal Republicans that he has to deal with to try to keep
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:17.320]  everyone in line. Well if the articles of impeachment are clearly set forth and
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:24.400]  no one could deny them in the debate that we have in the country then even the
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:36.720]  democratically the Democratic Senate could not deny the articles and they'd
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:42.480]  have to go along it seems to me with the the conviction of the impeachment
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:48.760]  against Barack Obama. It has to be a surgical strike and it can't wait forever.
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:54.960]  It has to be now. It can't go on and talk about it forever. Well that's my big
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:58.800]  issue is look at what they're already doing knowing that no one's stopping them.
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:03.520]  If he's already imploded the border and is funding Al Qaeda and is signing
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.400]  executive orders against the Second Amendment what's he going to do in the
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:13.600]  next two years? That's what I say. I mean it's got to be quick and swift. Not
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:18.880]  any of the stuff going on and on and on and on in the media and impeach not
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:23.400]  impeach whatever threats here and it's got to be quick. They got to be serious.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:27.200]  There's got to be some serious people in the House of Representatives to start
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.480]  this. I've talked about five or six different members of the House who I
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:35.720]  think would go along with it. Well Bob Barr says if he gets back in it looks
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:40.000]  like he will because he's having a landslide in the polls right now. He will
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.560]  introduce impeachment. Of course he did it last time. I appreciate your
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:47.640]  call. He's a former federal prosecutor and was a good one. No corruption there
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:52.520]  and he just says look it's the law. You got impeach. I mean that's what you do.
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:55.440]  You don't go. We're winning a lot of points because he's committing a lot of
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:03.480]  crime. Let's let him stay in there. Andrew you're on the air. Go ahead. Yeah I
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:08.280]  think you have to impeach but there's just I just see too many. I see a little
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:13.520]  problem with it. How far down would we have to go to find someone who's capable
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:18.640]  of running the country who's not corrupt? No no I agree but see it sends a
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:21.840]  message to them. I think we ought to indict a bunch of them and send them to
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:26.720]  prison like with Nixon. Let's put the vice president in jail.
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:33.000]  People are waking up. I see people waking up but I just it seems like
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.640]  they're putting it all on Obama instead of realizing that there's a whole
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:42.080]  another government controlling what we perceive. No no no I agree but they need
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:45.720]  the people in the Congress and the White House to follow the orders and
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:49.700]  commit the illegal acts so the public only knows the figureheads. Shall we put
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:53.400]  those figureheads in prison? I mean yeah that'll get the government's attention
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:57.680]  real fast. I'm telling you folks the government's totally criminal. It's time
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:02.000]  to start arresting. I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.600]  helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxified. Most people know
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:11.600]  that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world. Iodine is key
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:16.120]  to so many of the body's functions especially the thyroid. I discovered a
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:20.840]  product being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield true
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:25.240]  nascent iodine that your body can really absorb. Then about a year ago he said
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:29.400]  listen if you think this is powerful I'm going to come out with rare earth deep
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:34.360]  earth crystals and the results that I personally have had have been life
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:39.720]  changing. Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals ladies and

[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:14.480]  technocrats in Brzezinski's own words are trying to build is a penal planet
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:20.800]  basically or everyone is treated as guilty until proven innocent but it's
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:26.960]  beyond that this is a totalitarian system and joining us until 50 after and
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:31.560]  you will take your phone calls at the bottom of the hour we'll clear out some
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:37.480]  phone lines here later and take some calls for William Benny he's the former
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:41.720]  technical leader for intelligence with the national security agency before
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:46.280]  becoming a whistleblower in late 2001 after more than 30 years with the
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:50.880]  agency Benny has been described as one of the best analysts and codebreakers in
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:55.960]  NSA history. Benny continues to speak out about the NSA's data collection
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:01.000]  policies and continues to do interviews in media regarding his experiences and
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.360]  communication intercepts by governmental agencies of American citizens. In a
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:09.920]  legal case Benny has testified in affidavit that the NSA is in deliberate
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:16.280]  violation of the US Constitution. Exposedfacts.org is one site where you can
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:20.960]  read some of his writings. Two weeks ago on the one in Gardingen they ran a story
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:25.040]  about him testifying to the German parliament in a German intelligence
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:29.640]  surveillance inquiry. The headline was the ultimate goal of the NSA is total
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:35.080]  population control. At least 80% of all audio calls not just metadata are
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:39.880]  recorded and stored in US says whistleblower William Benny. That's a
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:45.040]  totalitarian mentality. In another interview he described it as we are now
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:53.040]  in a police state and we now take you to the highest ranking ever NSA or period
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:57.760]  intelligence whistleblower from the highest levels to break down what's
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:02.320]  really going on. William Benny thank you so much for your courageous action in
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:07.880]  defense of free civilization. Well thank you and thanks for having me. You know
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:12.480]  there's so many places to go here sir but but first off just seven eight years
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:16.800]  ago Bush would get up and say we don't listen to any Americans without warrants
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:21.880]  it's preposterous. Eight years later okay we listen to everything you do but
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:27.160]  it's for your own good. Describe what we're facing here and where you see
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:30.880]  things going because my concern is thanks to you and others we know about the
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:38.560]  level of deception now but now it's almost like a mainlining of this. Yeah
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:43.200]  the the real problem is that when you gather all kinds of information like
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:47.280]  this on everybody in the planet that gives you leverage to blackmail anybody
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:52.360]  you want and and like the KGB this is the kind of stuff that they did I mean
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:56.080]  the point is that if they can't get to at you directly they can try to get it
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:00.360]  somebody that you are care about someone in your family or someone that you're
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:05.880]  really interested in protecting and so that's some of the techniques that I
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:09.600]  think are now possible with all the information that they've assembled and
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:14.480]  they're using the FBI to look at it to do things like find find something that
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:18.760]  would leverage and get the Petraeus or a general Petraeus or Allen out of office
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:23.160]  or or look at how to get rid of Elliot Spitzer who was going after the bankers
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:28.840]  after that colossal banking failure in 2008 something that would help protect
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:32.560]  the interest that you have and yet get rid of your opponents or people you don't
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:42.640]  particularly care to have around. Total control beyond the Stasi I want to talk
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:47.320]  about I mean I know you can't get into classified things that you were involved
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:51.160]  in but I've talked to Wayne Madsen and other NSA whistleblowers and he said
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:55.880]  that back when he was in the agency they really didn't spy on people illegally
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:02.480]  and that there has been a real change and a real shift is that accurate and
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:11.240]  Phil folks on why you left in 2001. First I left in 2001 in October once I found out
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:15.600]  that they were spying on everybody in the United States that meant they were
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:19.120]  pulling in initially this was the first round I mean I've been working the
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:24.320]  Soviet Union for almost 30 years and the KGB and the MVD were really they
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:27.320]  focused in on getting all kinds of information they possibly could on their
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:30.880]  population as well as anybody in the world that they could use that and they
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:34.800]  could use that information as leverage against them this was a standard tactic
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:40.720]  to use in espionage so and the Stasi was no different in East Germany they did
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:45.560]  the same thing except they didn't do it anywhere nearer as complete and as
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:51.520]  accurate and as timely as we do it so when they started that with the telecoms
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:54.880]  pulling in all the data and the telephoning of every US citizen as well
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:59.040]  as everybody else they could in the world well that simply meant to me that
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:03.240]  they had no respect whatsoever for the for the oath of office to protect and
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:08.440]  defend the Constitution in fact they scrapped the Constitution so and that's
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:12.720]  what I saw and they did it under the guise of article 2 War Powers Act that
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:17.960]  President Bush was claiming well in fact I kept asking the lawyers that I had and
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:21.480]  others that said what what war are we in when did Congress declare war and the
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:27.520]  answers they didn't and so therefore he could not in fact claim War Powers Act so
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:31.120]  they were all doing it on our false premise and everybody bought into that
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:34.360]  because we've just been attacked and they were all afraid of getting another
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:39.920]  attack and instead of using discipline and analysis and and focused active I
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:45.200]  focused disciplined analysis to find the bad guys and go after them and get
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:49.360]  them and stop them they went to this bulk acquisition of data on everybody
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:54.320]  which which simply inundated them with information and unless they focused in
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:57.840]  on a target in that bulk data they couldn't find anything else in the
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:01.600]  in the grand scheme of things because it was just too much data to look at no
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:06.960]  human or set of humans could possibly do it so if you if you were if you were
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:10.240]  doing something they didn't like they could focus on you and go after you but
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:14.600]  with all this data but if you weren't if you were if you were trying to detect
[01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:18.760]  terrorism around the around the world in this bulk act data acquisition
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:24.840]  environment why you you were buried and you couldn't find them so that's the
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:28.160]  that's really the problems that I see I mean they were making themselves
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:31.280]  dysfunctional they couldn't actually protect us anymore and they were
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:35.400]  violating our constitutional rights and and throwing away our privacy when in
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:38.880]  fact they could have maintained all the privacy of everyone in the world focused
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:43.280]  in attack on unknown terrorists and bad guys and zones of suspicion around them
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:48.280]  and done a real focus discipline attack to stop these things and succeed it
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:55.360]  instead they took this bulk approach and failed William Benny the top NSA
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:16:00.640]  whistleblower in history joins us expose facts org is the whistleblower
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:05.320]  website where you can read some of his specific writings you know I've been
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:10.760]  politically involved promoting liberty for 20 years on air now and I personally
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:16.240]  have had repercussions that have even come out in the newspapers by the FBI
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:22.160]  and others and when you get on a White House enemies list and it comes out in
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:28.640]  the newspapers it's surreal and I personally have covered secret government
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:34.720]  conferences like Bilderberg and then had them call my wife no number comes up on
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:40.840]  the phone and you know say I hope your dad dies when he's in the hospital and
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:44.880]  is just gone I mean they're obviously listening to the phone I have experienced
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:49.280]  this so so I understand how draconian it is I know it's come out that some of the
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:52.840]  NSA whistleblowers have been harassed have had repercussions it's come out in
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:17:00.000]  the news that NSA people are using it to harass their ex-wives ex-husbands police
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.440]  are using databases to harass people in New York over the white flags last
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:08.440]  week they now admit they're pulling everyone's cell phone data basically in
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:14.840]  the city to track who was where I mean this is this is ubiquitous now that
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:20.040]  it's being used for political control and then we learn from Seattle Washington
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:24.760]  to Chicago Illinois to Austin Texas there's been a covert 15-year program
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:29.320]  that we first broke discovering the federal parts disorders and grants to
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:36.040]  put microphones up listening to people on street corners it's just the skies
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:42.440]  the limit now of this Orwellian system have you ever mr. Benny or do you know
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:48.880]  of others that have been targeted and and harassed using the NSA systems well I
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:54.080]  know I have because I've been in the sworn affidavit they signed against us
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:18:00.200]  the group of NSA whistleblowers and they claimed that they had a recording of
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:03.800]  phone call that I told them about which I know I didn't tell them about so they
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:09.160]  that was basically they were exposing the warrantless wiretap they had on it so
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:14.040]  so they were doing that to us and and they were I mean they were doing it to
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:19.680]  all kinds people call I mean Thomas Tam who is the who is the DOJ attorney
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:24.600]  preparing warrant requests for the FISA court detected some of this warrantless
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:31.400]  wiretapping back in 2003 2004 and and he he was one of the sources for the New
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:36.000]  York Times exposure of the warrantless wiretapping program and so he
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.520]  recognized that they were they were violating the the constitutional rights
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:43.880]  of everybody and violating the law in fact he on frontline and a recent
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:48.880]  broadcast said that this was a federal felony that they were committing and
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:52.480]  there was a time there back at that period of time when they thought maybe
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:58.280]  the Attorney General would be indicted that was Ashcroft at the time so you
[01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:00.960]  know they've known that this has been good that's the kind of tactics and
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:05.120]  techniques they've been using all along and and in the process what they do is
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:09.040]  they fabricate evidence they go around and do a parallel construction to get
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:13.400]  like using normal policing techniques to try to find the data they already know
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:17.400]  where it is so it makes it pretty easy you know and so then they go go get it
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:21.520]  through normal policing techniques and substitute that for the NSA collection as
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:26.320]  the basis for arresting people to submit that data in court which means they're
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:30.320]  perjuring themselves in court every time they do that and you know and
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:34.800]  simply subverting our entire judicial process in the end and as they're
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:39.800]  executing I mean I call this a planned program perjury policy run by the
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:44.760]  Department of Justice of the United States is it not by the very definition
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:51.520]  organized crime racketeering I would think of it that way yes it's a king pen
[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:56.760]  operation because if you study king pen operations from Sicily right through to
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:20:01.960]  modern times using the Italian model which even goes back to Caesar you
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:05.880]  corrupt people it's not just getting them to take the money or getting them to
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:12.080]  violate the law now you can blackmail the DEA agents the FBI the Secret Service
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:16.920]  and everyone else you can also plant fake data on them without even using the
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:22.160]  sneak and peek provision of the Patriot Act and it is bigger than just spying
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:27.040]  on everyone or ruining and muddying all the intelligence waters it's a chilling
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:32.920]  effect but it's also a mass corrupting program or now I mean I've talked to
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:35.960]  local police years ago that were in the threat vision center and they said no we
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:40.440]  can listen to you right now so so then select police are being brought in and
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:45.600]  federalized and allowed to get into the Palantir system I mean it's right now I
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:50.880]  think they're using the cover of NSA coming out Mr. Benny to actually hide
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:56.760]  it in plain view and if we don't reverse this this this this revolution of Big
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:02.560]  Brother it will now be standardized do you do you get my finer point there yes
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:06.720]  I do and I fact I agree totally with it and it is a gap out of an example you
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:12.520]  can use the Nancy Pelosi when she was Speaker of the House if you recall when
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:18.320]  she said that impeaching George Bush is off the table yes if you remember that
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:25.200]  well the point was that she was co-opted into that program in October of 2001 she
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:29.760]  and that she was the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee and at
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:33.200]  that time the chair and ranking members of the House and Senate Intelligence
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:37.200]  meetings were the only ones in Congress briefed on this program that was the I
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:42.200]  think around the 4th of October of 2001 and she bought into that pro those
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:47.680]  programs as well as the other similar programs at CIA which meant that George
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:51.040]  Bush could say if you want to impeach me you have to impeach yourself because
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:54.920]  you're a part of this you're culpable of this so that's the that's the leverage
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:22:00.560]  of about leverage that he had against her so that's the that leverages the game
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:06.600]  they're playing it really is the ultimate form of discrimination by a ruling
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:11.600]  class in the Soviet Union in Eastern Germany the British of course wrote the
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:18.920]  book on this as you know to gobble up everything create files on everything and
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:25.840]  then he used it to politically persecute who you want but then beyond that
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:30.840]  only the establishment and select corporations that are part of it are
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:36.280]  given access to it they then use the data not even against political enemies
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:43.240]  but to consolidate the economy it's unfair trade practices it's the end of
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:47.840]  the free market and then you find out it's been an organized telecommunications
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:52.840]  plan since the early 90s and the Telecommunications Act of 96 to put
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:57.960]  these hubs in everywhere you were there at the NSA at that time I mean weren't
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:03.240]  people concerned like James Banford I know wrote about it when it was obvious
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:09.400]  that they were putting in this real-time surveillance well I think the issue goes
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:13.040]  back and this is probably what Jim was referring back to was the back in the
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:18.840]  Nixon days when he had NSA with their program Minaret and FBI with co-intel
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:23.920]  pro and CIA with chaos all collaborating to spy on enemies of the
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:29.440]  Nixon administration those opposing the war Martin Luther King John Lennon and
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:33.640]  various other people in the in the country there were they they at the time
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:37.080]  you see the problem was they could only do so much they they only had so much
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:41.840]  effort so they can only handle maybe a couple thousand people but now with the
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:46.200]  new technologies that gives you the capability to do everybody in the
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:50.200]  country in fact most people in the world which means you're monitoring
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:55.440]  hundreds of millions if not billions of people every day so that's the kind of
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:59.720]  low leverage that this kind of technology gives them they're doing what
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:04.400]  Nixon did was an infinitesimal of what they're doing now that's the whole point
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:07.600]  of it and Nixon got impeached those were the articles of impeachment against
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:12.320]  them and and we're sitting here doing nothing about it you simply accepting
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:17.880]  you've exposed the parallel construction that was in Reuters last August
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:22.480]  exclusive us directs agents to cover up program used to investigate Americans
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:25.840]  where they're drag netting the phone records the phone calls of people
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:30.360]  selling each other marijuana and things like that they selectively leave the
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:34.160]  big cartels alone the big banks laundering the money they then farm out
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:40.000]  the data to the DEA who then farms it out to the threat fusion centers and a
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.280]  local police what this is really doing larger than just parallel construction
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:49.600]  and the fraud of the judicial system is it's the federalization of the police
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:55.040]  because they're only given access to the select data trails that the feds want
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:25:00.720]  them to go after hence setting up a system of selective enforcement that's
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:06.600]  great and also there was a quote from then at Reuters article last year from a
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:10.480]  federal agent who said this is such a great program I just hope we can keep
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:15.200]  it secret well you know you don't you don't get an informed electorate or
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:20.320]  anything in a democracy that way I mean that's a secret government unbelievable
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:24.720]  I know there's a lot you can't talk about because of national security you
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:29.360]  know agreements and letters but we've seen Sabelle Edmonds and whistleblower
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:35.640]  from the FBI NSA side breaking the gag order and exposing the fact that our
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:39.440]  government was basically manipulating and handling and protecting Al Qaeda right
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:47.200]  up until 9-11 now we see ISIS IS Al Qaeda being armed to attack Syria allowed
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:54.080]  into Libya the very group we're told we have the NSA to fight what is your view
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:59.120]  on Sabelle Edmonds and people like her well I think she certainly pointed out
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:03.040]  some very important things that we need to pay attention to I mean and and again
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:09.440]  I think that the general population probably is not as actively involved as
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:14.560]  it should be by any means so I mean you need to tell these people what they're
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:18.600]  doing is just a violation of our fundamental rights and you need to say
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:22.200]  if you don't if you don't straighten up and start to do the right thing next
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:26.400]  election I'm firing you I mean that's what you've got to do with these people
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:31.480]  you have to tell them outright you're fired well that was my next question is
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:35.280]  is you're the expert I'm asking the questions I want you to take the floor
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:39.800]  here when we come back from break and you know speak to the American people
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:43.800]  millions of folks out there about a plan of action how you think we turn this
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:49.360]  around and other points and we're going to give listeners an opportunity to
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:58.200]  tweet their questions at real Alex Jones on Twitter at hashtag pound IW chats
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:05.200]  so hashtag IW chats tweet your questions for the top NSA whistleblower
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:11.160]  William Benny and he will graciously answer your questions here on air today
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:14.640]  you know turn down his big high-paying job at the very highest levels of the
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:19.440]  NSA directing an entire division to begin to warn the American people first he
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:23.800]  warned Congress nothing happened now he's warning folks publicly and warning
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:27.320]  the German government the British government and others William Benny is
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:33.600]  our guest so send your questions there to real Alex Jones on Twitter at hashtag
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:41.600]  IW chats and we will take those questions coming up in the next segment but
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:45.160]  other points that you think are important for listeners out there to be
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:51.400]  aware of mr. Benny well I mean I look at this is the is a fundamental
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.600]  destruction of our democracy I mean this is really what's going on they're
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:00.480]  destroying the foundation of this country and and in the process they're
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:03.440]  doing it around the world I mean it's not just limited here what they do is
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:08.160]  they use this data around the world for law enforcement and they use it to
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:11.520]  leverage people I mean that's one of the one of the things that I tried to warn
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:16.440]  people about all around is that this kind of gathering of information exposes
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:23.120]  everybody to forms of pressure or coercion and so I mean those are the
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:27.800]  real I mean it's showing really the fail frailty of human beings and how they
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:32.240]  how they tend to use once you give them knowledge and that really is power once
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:36.400]  you give them that power one way or another they tend to use it sooner or
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:41.320]  later and so the point is you need to have a real rigorous way of managing and
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:46.280]  making sure that that they can't do it without being exposed we don't have that
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:49.600]  now what they do with whistleblowers is they attack them they put them in jail
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:53.680]  you know they do all kinds of things discredit them and everything they use
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:58.160]  the KGB tactics of saying they're mentally impaired or you know they're
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:01.600]  disgruntled employees or you know we need to put them away or something like
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:05.840]  that so it's you can't believe the narrative you're getting out of the
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:09.200]  administration or the White House without challenge and if you don't
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:13.680]  challenge it and you know you're just swallowing the line that they're
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:20.080]  well there's also that paradox historically where by 1939 people knew
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:24.000]  Hitler was bad but what do you do he's in charge it's the same thing with this
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.320]  bureaucracy and these corporate interests that are heavily hooked into the
[01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:31.840]  NSA and other agencies they're just operating criminally out in the open
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:36.000]  now they're not getting in trouble and every time we say hey get back under
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.600]  control they say hey let us spy on you or terrorists will attack you meanwhile
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:43.840]  the border is wide open and the government's funding ISIS it just
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:47.160]  doesn't hold water so what's the next step we'll talk to William Benning
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:53.440]  straight ahead we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:58.880]  intellectually it's but God you can fail it.
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:11.880]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:19.320]  I'm just an average man with an average life I work from 95 hell I pay the price
[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:25.240]  all I want is to be left alone in my average home but why do I always feel
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:31.320]  like I'm in the twilight soon and I always feel like somebody's watching me.
[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:37.680]  obviously there's a lot of schizophrenics out there who are paranoid
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:43.800]  delusionals and it must be hellish for them that now we openly live in a big
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:50.640]  brother's society and someone really is watching them but the establishment
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:54.000]  doesn't care about the poor schizophrenics at the bus stop talking to
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.560]  themselves they care about the patent you've coming out with they care about
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:03.400]  the fact that you saw the senator beating his wife they want to know that
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:08.120]  you saw a drug shipment being flown into Mina Arkansas this allows the criminals
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:13.120]  in government in the organized crime networks that have infested it to
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:21.120]  basically get away with bloody murder and I've interviewed so many CIA whistleblowers
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:28.880]  I've interviewed so many defense intelligence whistleblowers Delta
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:34.640]  force whistleblowers CIA contractor whistleblowers it makes national news
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:40.120]  you've heard them here but a lot of this comes out on c-span but now with
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:45.320]  Edward Snowden and William Benny and others there's no denying it so there's
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:49.680]  this paradox that I was talking about earlier of where they've denied all this
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:53.600]  is happening now it's admitted but they say hey you better let us do this or
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:57.320]  terrorists will get you but then meanwhile they're aiding and abetting
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:02.560]  radical Wahhabist all over the world in a destabilization program William Benny
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:10.440]  is our guest the toll-free number to talk to him is 800-259-9231 please call
[01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:13.640]  with a question for him who won't screen your call but just ask a brief
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:20.400]  questions we can get a couple of your calls in 800-259-9231 and the tweet
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:24.680]  questions are coming in at real Alex Jones as well we'll get to some of those
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:31.360]  here in a moment but sir how do they get people into government that will
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:36.200]  engage in classical Soviet style intimidation of the Associated Press of
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:42.480]  Fox News dossiers on drudgereport.com on info wars.com that's come out in
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:47.960]  four-year request how do they get people to listen to your phone and then call
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:50.480]  your family member up and tell them they were listening to private
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:54.920]  conversations to mess with their minds as has happened to me on six or seven
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:36:02.240]  occasions how do they get the governing class to engage in truly totalitarian
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:11.320]  activities. Most people I knew at NSA were all very you know patriotic
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:16.640]  conscientious you know hard-working people who believed in the Constitution
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:21.680]  the rights of individuals but the problem was a lot of them about 85% of
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:27.400]  them were introverted type people and that's come out by studies they've done
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:32.600]  on the population at NSA they're on the Myers-Briggs scale they're ISTJs
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:39.360]  introverted sensing technical judgmental kind of people and so that's an easy
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:43.600]  class to intimidate and that's basically what the government's been doing they've
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:48.000]  been intimidating that's why the Tom Drake trial was they tried to make a make
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:53.280]  it open accusations against Tom Drake in public so that they could what they
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:57.960]  were doing was telling the rest of the population of the workforce that if you
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:01.720]  if you blow the whistle on us we are going to come after you with everything
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:07.000]  we've got and that's exactly they showed for example the 60-minute program that
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:13.120]  was done back in May of 2011 they about Tom Drake and the situation he was in
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:18.960]  they showed that that program internally in NSA to say you see to the
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:22.440]  workforce you see this is what's going to happen to you if you blow the whistle
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:26.520]  on us so what they were doing was intimidating them and that's and they're
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:31.040]  very it's a it's a group of people who fundamentally are interested in or
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:34.920]  concerned about keeping their jobs they've got families they've got you know
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:38.240]  bills they've got you want to send their kids to college they have all of those
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:42.280]  kinds of things and it's all depending on them keeping a job and so that's what
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:45.160]  they were doing there is threatening them with their job and even their
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:49.760]  livelihood and and their freedom and that's fundamentally what they did
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:53.880]  internally in NSA and other places and they later on like right now they're
[01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:59.200]  interested in programs internally in NSA to say see something say something which
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:02.520]  means they're having the workforce by against each other just like they did
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:07.360]  in East Germany with the Saudi so it's the same it's the same whole at the same
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:11.320]  principles they're applying those principles universally to intimidate
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:16.800]  people so they'll stay quiet and that's how they keep them they that's how they
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:20.400]  get them to do what they want now there's a certain proportion of the
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:25.840]  population who loves doing violent things I mean that's that's kind of thing
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:30.680]  that do you you you can find those kinds of people anywhere and they they they
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:34.640]  tend to use them the way they will I guess like for example threatening you
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:41.160]  or threatening other people and they physically threatening them physically too so Wow
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:45.360]  William Benny top NSA whistleblower is here live on air with us on the radio
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:52.720]  and TV at real Alex Jones on Twitter the questions are pouring in Mr. Benny one
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:57.360]  of those questions is when do you think the in-game is coming that's from Ernie
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:02.280]  Ciarola on Twitter when do you think the in-game is coming and I would ask you
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:08.960]  what is the in-game of this total surveillance society well it seems to
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:14.640]  me that they're tending toward a European style government or a even more
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:20.080]  leaning toward a stasi type government a stasi run government where the
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:24.200]  intelligence service basically determines a lot of the policy of the
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:28.360]  government and that's what's happening here the intelligence community is more
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:33.080]  or less directing what the government is doing and how they do it and it's
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:37.480]  it's basically affecting everything that even international decision like they
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:42.400]  they use them I guess to start the war in Iraq you know and they use that kind
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:48.000]  of information back in the Tonkin Gulf where they the death now more all that
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.600]  kind of stuff is influencing trying to influence how the government doing it
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:55.480]  they're getting much more and more involved and it's building a much larger
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:59.640]  empire with contractors all around the country and over you know a couple
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:05.000]  million of them I mean it's not it's the Washington Posted a series of three
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.560]  articles on top secret America that was a rather good article of laying out this
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:13.840]  bureaucracy that's been that's been built up as since 9-11 all around the
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:18.640]  country in fact around the world I mean well when you when you push up to a
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:22.360]  hundred billion dollars into the intelligence community every year I
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:26.280]  mean that gets the approaching a trillion dollars now that they've spent on
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:31.640]  this since 9-11 well that's the kind of thing that builds a bureaucracy that
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:36.400]  tends to need to feed and continue feeding yes and so that that just
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:39.960]  continues and perpetuates itself and they try to gain more and more influence
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:44.120]  like for example even I mean it came out recently that even when they were
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:48.360]  back it when they were running minaret at NSA one of the people they hit from
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:52.000]  the fact that they were spying on them was a senator church and he was running
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.760]  the investigation against them so I mean it shows you that they have the
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:41:00.560]  capacity to do these kinds things in secret and Russ Tice has also come out
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:06.360]  and testified that that they were spying on members of Congress and also you know
[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:12.360]  members of the military the senior ranking generals as well as the
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:15.400]  members of the Supreme Court and then they use that when they want to destroy
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:19.720]  him to show they've got a mistress or a girlfriend exactly exactly and and this
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:26.400]  is the bureaucracy the military industrial complex illegally using data
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:30.760]  for political takeover as we know has come out in England where parliament is
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:35.680]  secretly being spied on they then use dirt on parliament to make them vote to
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:39.840]  continue the illegal spying that makes the Rupert Murdoch phone hacking
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:44.800]  scandal look like child's play I mean this is just unbelievable the
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:51.120]  ramifications of this yeah I mean that that's why that's why I was saying that
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:55.120]  they have this collecting all this bulk data gives them the ability to find
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:59.440]  information on anybody in the world and therefore use that as leverage or black
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:03.440]  mail against either them or someone they care about so and that's how you
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:08.200]  leverage people that's the standard KGB tactics for doing it so you spent 30
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:13.840]  years fighting the KGB William Benny's our guest and now we are becoming the
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:23.080]  KGB simply astounding another question comes in from the dead Reds he says is
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:27.720]  there a wake up at real Alex Jones on Twitter is there a wake up inside NSA
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:31.720]  good people within wanting to make a change I think you kind of already
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:36.440]  answered that earlier saying that yes they use the NSA system and have a whole
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:41.720]  NSA division it's come out to spy on the employees not to stop foreign espionage
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:48.920]  but to stop people from exposing crime yes that's right amazing continuing if
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:56.480]  we can't rely on elected politicians as CWED 762 when all is lost you believe we
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:03.920]  can rely on military rebellion to help in reconstruction William Benny well I
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:08.600]  think there's going to be a fundamental revolution coming because I think
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:12.320]  at least from my sense of it is the people in America here are starting to
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:15.920]  wake up to this threat they're starting to realize the dangers of what's going on
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:21.320]  and I think that that's going to be a ground ground based from the bottom up
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:25.800]  revolution that's going to push push these people to do the right thing I
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:30.280]  mean otherwise I think we ought to fire them I mean after all they are the ones
[01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:33.920]  that got us to where we are and we are here because of them they should be
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:38.120]  fired that's all that's the way I look at and then we should have a special
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:41.920]  prosecutor come back and clean it up I mean we have to do this we have to hold
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:45.520]  these people accountable or else it's going to continue like for example I
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:50.080]  blame this all on Jerry Ford because Jerry Ford pardon Nixon Nixon was already
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:54.600]  indicted he was going to go into court and then and then Ford pardoned him
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:44:00.240]  that's why I didn't vote for him by the way I voted for Jimmy Carter because he
[01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:05.280]  pardoned Nixon I mean that was the ultimate insult I mean he what he was
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:10.160]  trying to do what he did effectively was say the president is above the law is
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:14.960]  get out of jail free card is the next president and that meant that if things
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:19.680]  could only get worse since then and that's what's happened obviously Obama
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:25.680]  is a puppet but Boehner says that he shouldn't be impeached I understand as
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:29.200]  Ron Paul says on this show just a few weeks ago all of them should be impeached
[01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:33.360]  who who've been voting for this NSA and who know what's going on Congress likes
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:37.120]  to pass the buck on the president but Obama more and more is acting like a
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:41.880]  dictator doesn't it send the right message to start impeachment of Obama on
[01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:46.800]  the NSA front and then let's go and impeach Boehner as well shouldn't we
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:53.080]  see a constitutional legal lawful purge of all of the Stasi people in our
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:57.120]  government yes I believe we should and one of the ways to do it then we can do
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:00.560]  it without Washington being involved at all and that's to have under article 5
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:05.720]  of our Constitution is to have a state's constitutional convention and we can
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:10.520]  write in changes to the Constitution and ratify them at the same time since
[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:15.440]  the state's doing it yeah where we could have a special prosecutor appointed by
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:19.880]  the states and the people and given them the backing of the state police the
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:26.160]  local police as well as the National Guards in all the states so that they
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:30.720]  have the backing of the power of the state to appoint prosecutors to go after
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:35.240]  everyone in DC well I've always been against a concon because they could
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:41.680]  hijack it but now the bureaucracy is operating as an autocratic technocratic
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:47.280]  system publicly they brag about it so what does it matter I agree with you I
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:52.560]  think the salvation lies with the states because that's where the people
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:56.840]  reside William Benny top NSA whistleblowers graciously giving us his
[01:45:56.840 --> 01:46:03.480]  time today to try to promote basic freedom expose facts dot org is the
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:06.680]  website where you can see his work and other whistleblowers work I want to go
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:11.160]  to some phone calls here in a moment but I wanted to ask you because listeners
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:16.760]  are tweeting and asking about encryption they're asking about different forms of
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:21.240]  encryption and and does it work I'm no encryption expert and no code breaker
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:25.920]  like you but from what's been mainline news almost all major encryption it
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:32.520]  turns out was set up by NSA moles to have backdoors into it and and I think we
[01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:38.040]  should protest and remove the spying itself you know trying to avoid it from
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:42.720]  what I've read actually pushed you at top of the list to be snooped on is that
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:48.520]  an accurate statement sir yes FBI looks at it by saying if you encrypt what
[01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:51.720]  you're saying to one another that means you're hiding something therefore you're
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:55.320]  guilty of something therefore we're going to target you that's basically
[01:46:55.320 --> 01:47:00.760]  their their approach my mind I just you just made the statement about the
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:05.240]  encryption being under under the program Bull Run which is what NSA is doing it's
[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:09.360]  weakening encryptions or getting black backdoors in for FBI or anybody else in
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:12.640]  the intelligence community to get into them but they have weaknesses in the
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:16.920]  systems that so that in many cases they have the ability to read them and that
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:21.280]  means that the none of the existing publicly available encryption systems
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:26.200]  are necessarily secure so you can't really I mean tour I think is one way of
[01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:32.840]  helping to add a complication to it tour is a kind of a anonymizing program
[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:36.320]  that allows you to send your packets of email around different ways so it gets a
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:41.480]  it hides who you are in the network as the test and where where you're going if
[01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:46.120]  once you get there so it is that add a layer of complexity to the problem which
[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:49.120]  I think they're still from what I've read anyway they're still working through
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:52.800]  it they're having some successes but they're not through it yet so there's
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:57.520]  still that that level of protection that could occur there but with the
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:01.520]  encryption it's doubtful that if they're really after you that you can because
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:06.440]  after all even if you encrypt something successfully and you can you can defeat
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:10.400]  their attack that the crypt system once you decrypt something and put it on your
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:13.960]  computer they can come in actively and attack your computer and take it off
[01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:17.720]  after you decrypt it well sure and and of course I was told about this years ago
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:22.320]  but it came out last year the new chips come out that can be energized even if
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:26.000]  your computers walled off and on on the internet and they can energize the chips
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:31.560]  wirelessly and suck the data off that way that's right yeah William Benny top
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:36.360]  NSL was top NSA whistleblower is our guest we're moving quickly here let's
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:40.040]  go to some phone calls George in Connecticut you're on the air quick
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:45.520]  question quick question I had been victimized by this stuff anonymous calls
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:50.120]  they can't trace death threats all sorts of stuff from government officials when
[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:55.520]  when you start to step on high toes but the but my my question is they basically
[01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:59.440]  run everything out to the nth degree so that you can't they run it past the
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:02.440]  statute of limitations so you can't do anything so when you have enough
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:06.400]  information you have enough details you have enough witnesses they basically a
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:09.440]  scott free we got to find a way to say look they don't if they were doing this
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:14.240]  through the government means and and basically able to run the clock out
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:18.520]  there is should not be a clock at all it should be a government crime should be
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:25.240]  have no statute of limitations within the government itself yeah I think the
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:30.880]  statute of limitations though is on the filing that is if you file a suit or an
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:34.480]  accident illegal action against something give a certain amount of time to do
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:39.280]  that but once you file then then you've met that limitation sure that's one
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:43.400]  way of doing it but I know exactly what you're saying they try to drag things
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:48.680]  out as long as possible hoping that you'll get exhausted or you'll exhaust
[01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:53.000]  your resources and can't continue and drop it and that's the kind of hope they
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:56.480]  have and that's the kind of power they've got all the time and money in the
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:59.360]  world I mean after all they need more money and they'll tax you some more
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:04.080]  total tyranny a scientific tyranny George thank you mr. Benny you've been very
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:07.280]  gracious with the time we've got a break coming up if you've got to go I
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:11.680]  understand or can you go another 10 minutes to the end of the hour sure I
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:15.000]  can go to the end thank you you're very nice because I want to come back and
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:19.880]  jam in a call from Rob West George and Brian but quick questions folks so he
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:24.920]  can he can answer those mr. Benny is that website I was giving out earlier

[01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:15.920]  government bailouts stock and real estate bubbles that are primed to pop at
[01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:20.360]  any moment which can flush away most or all of your retirement savings this type
[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:24.960]  of movement has enormous consequences virtually zero sectors of the economy or
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:29.200]  hiring and workforce participation is at record lows financial trouble is
[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:33.560]  right here at our doorstep but if you move right now and develop a backup plan

[01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:58.840]  history repeats itself
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:12.120]  we got a real American hero William Benning on the line with us I don't
[01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:15.240]  really admire football players or movie stars and I've gotten to know a lot of
[01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:19.200]  them but I admire people that have courage and have honor and who've tried
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:23.120]  to protect this country and who fought the Soviets who were a true evil and
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:28.520]  here he is telling you after running a major division of the NSA that we are
[01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:34.080]  mimicking the Soviet model or the Eastern German model Mr. Benning I
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:37.200]  want to get it to a few more tweets and a few more calls here in the six minutes
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:43.360]  we've got or five minutes now but what's the bottom line here I would kind of
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:47.320]  expect express the bottom line this way I know where we've been very comfortable
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:51.240]  and in this country and expect our government to abide by the rules and
[01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:55.560]  the law and everything that's because we haven't had the a dictator in this
[01:54:55.560 --> 01:55:00.360]  country since George the third about 240 years ago so we've been coming over
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:04.360]  time we we don't have that living memory or the experience of having a
[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:08.960]  totalitarian state not like the Germans do and that's why the Germans are so
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:14.120]  upset because they have living memory of the Stasi and some some of the SS and
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:19.360]  KGB and they know what this is all about and so with that with that background
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:23.800]  is we in the United States become more trusting of the federal government and
[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:27.840]  they don't deserve it and we need to stand up and speak up against it that's
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:31.800]  the whole point I guess and for those that don't know every time you get one
[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:37.240]  of these these panopticon systems in it only gets worse the country devolves so
[01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:40.840]  that's why the Germans are literally freaking out because they know folks
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:45.920]  this thing rots this doesn't get better unless you remove it we have cancer
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:50.400]  politically let's talk to Rob in Oregon real quick Rob go ahead with the
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:55.160]  question for William Benny thanks Alex I'm Mr. Benny thanks a million for your
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:56:00.600]  sacrifices a quick question how active and intrusive is Canada in spite on
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:06.920]  their citizens well Canada is a part of the five eyes so and I'm I'm not clear
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:10.840]  on what extent they're involved with currently although I believe they have
[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:14.920]  access to things through the through a program that was published or not too
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:19.360]  long ago X key score yes which is like an interrogation route public routine
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:24.560]  that that any of the five eyes I believe can use they all swap data going into
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:29.440]  this bulk act acquired data yeah so I think they're involved in that way to
[01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:33.120]  what extent they participate in you know cross-spying like they look at us
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:37.040]  people we look at theirs I don't know I don't know what that is so what that
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:41.480]  relationship is I think they're they're working together in a common database in
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:46.040]  a common analytic attack of that database mm-hmm thank you so much Rob great
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:50.320]  question that's amazing having such an expert mind on encryption here with us
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:54.480]  and how this works another question does mr. Benny know about the
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:57.880]  intelligence agencies using their capabilities to manipulate the stock
[01:56:57.880 --> 01:57:02.800]  markets and that's from one of our listeners on real Alex Jones Mike's
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:07.880]  headroom well I really don't know anything about that although it's not
[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:11.240]  it's not impossible that they couldn't be using that I mean that data is
[01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:16.560]  available for industrial espionage as well so you know that's the problem with
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:20.280]  this bulk acquisition of data like this that makes everything possible the
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:24.120]  question is are they really doing it none I don't really know for sure it's a
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:30.360]  universe of data what about the issue of planting DNA planting fingerprints we
[01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:34.080]  know that's gone on for a long time the media acts like they're 100% what about
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:38.000]  all the governmental and corporate planting of evidence on people's
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:43.200]  computers using the system well I mean that that's certainly possible I mean
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:46.480]  it's not a you know what they can break into your computer and do just about
[01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:52.400]  anything they want to with it or or for example as one of the slides that was
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:56.840]  published recently I think in a newspaper in the Netherlands showed that
[01:57:56.840 --> 01:58:00.920]  the worldwide assets for collection and in there was a line that said greater
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:06.080]  than 50,000 implants in the worldwide network now what that means is that's
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:12.120]  either hardware or software implanted in switches or servers or computers in the
[01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:16.960]  worldwide network which means they basically control those devices and they
[01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:19.800]  can have them and instruct them to do virtually anything they want to do
[01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:24.640]  incredible they're not just sending it through a system a net that grabs it all
[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:28.920]  it's actually a control arm just like the ES systems to control communications
[01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:34.440]  it's a total technocratic system William Benny thank you so much sir for the
[01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:38.800]  time look forward to speaking to you again soon okay thank you amazing thank

[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:33.400]  Alex Jones I'm going to finish up with these NSA callers sorry you didn't get
[02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:37.360]  a chance to talk to William Benny but we ran out of time and then we're going to
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:43.520]  get the callers back on open the phones back up who wanted to talk about to
[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:47.920]  impeach or not to impeach you just heard William Benny who headed up one of the
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:53.560]  four divisions of the NSA he was technically number four in the NSA
[02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:57.480]  saying we have the intelligence agencies running and controlling the
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:02.600]  government and those intelligence agencies are all run by skull and bones
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:11.440]  Harvard Yale Oxford Princeton systems and their globalist eugenesis and I'm
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:17.200]  going to explain this to everybody again my father was top of his clash and then
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:23.280]  they tested 150 or something I forget Texans and then he was in the top six or
[02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:30.040]  so when he was in high school and he was brought into UT and they brought him in
[02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:34.800]  and basically said this is a secret eugenics program you're gonna be part
[02:01:34.800 --> 02:01:40.000]  of the ruling class whole nine yards and my dad never even really told me that
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:44.240]  till I was making in game and my mother was watching it at the office and said
[02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:48.400]  I don't believe this and then suddenly my dad just spilt his guts because he was
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:52.160]  never part of it growing up we had all the burzinski books and everything around
[02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:56.120]  the house I just knew all this by osmosis he would tell me how the world
[02:01:56.120 --> 02:02:01.720]  really ran but it's not that my dad out of you know 200 million people back in
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:07.640]  1965 was was you know Superman or something it was they were scooping
[02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:12.800]  everybody up and I've had experts from Congress you name it from the Frank
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:17.360]  Church Committee on to break this down since the 30s they've been scooping up
[02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:23.280]  mainly British intelligence all of the smartest people all of the people that
[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:28.080]  can get ahold of and putting them in British front groups and I want to be
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:34.360]  clear I am Welsh I probably have more English blood in me than you know any of
[02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:40.520]  the other high and 57 I am you know ton of German Alsatian French Scotch Irish
[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:45.200]  Native American I mean it's in there but so I'm not bashing the British people
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:50.000]  it's the model developed by British intelligence and they set up the first
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.640]  NSA the Nazis were so naive they didn't think the British could listen to every
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:57.600]  phone call they were listening to every phone call of the Nazis and were able to
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:01.480]  roll them all up and beat them very quickly people go we'll see it's spying
[02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:07.360]  is good British intelligence put Hitler in charge see that's declassified they
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:14.440]  didn't run Hitler they funded him they David Rockefeller's granddad John D
[02:03:14.440 --> 02:03:19.520]  Rockefeller funded Hitler I mean that's in Pulitzer prize winning books so we
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:25.080]  think of the evil to create Hitler so you can set up a police state to counter
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:31.280]  him to sell a free people on being slaves create Al Qaeda protect them let
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:35.320]  them attack you so you can set up a police state see it's the same deal and
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:38.840]  I know it's simple for our listeners understand the general public still goes
[02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:47.040]  why would Obama want to shut down power plants and increase the prices I mean he
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:53.800]  wants money no they control the printing of the money they want to only let
[02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:57.280]  General Electric and two other companies have power plants that makes them more
[02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:06.160]  money but it's about consolidating power it's about control control control over
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:12.760]  free will and if you control the energy from like a children's TV show from the
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:19.400]  80s I will get the energy on cubes Megatron what are the what are the
[02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:25.000]  Decepticons want they want energy they want control of the energy what's the
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  number one if you did an equation for human life you need our plant life or
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:34.600]  any life energy energy and that's why I keep going back to this power plants
[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:39.640]  being shut off or the borders being wide open they want to destroy our free will
[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:43.680]  and our capacity to live we're gonna come back and take your phone calls from

[02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:33.040]  linked to an assortment of major health issues including tooth decay lowered IQ

[02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:08.880]  so much get healthy and detoxify most people know that iodine deficiency has
[02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:13.920]  been a crisis around the world iodine is key to so many of the body's functions
[02:07:13.920 --> 02:07:18.800]  especially the thyroid I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group you
[02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:23.440]  now know it as survival shield true nascent iodine that your body can really
[02:07:23.440 --> 02:07:27.480]  absorb then about a year ago he said listen if you think this is powerful I'm
[02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:32.520]  going to come out with rare earth deep earth crystals and the results that I
[02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:37.760]  personally have had have been life-changing nobody else has got iodine

[02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:50.520]  whole things turned in for industrial espionage and the takeover of America
[02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:55.480]  and that the intelligence agencies run the government and have corrupted the
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:12:00.200]  whole government and are blackmailing the whole government and he witnessed it
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:04.520]  and quit but he can't tell us because of quote national security laws what he
[02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:09.520]  knows he'd have to get run to another country and he's sure he's gonna run to
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:19.920]  Russia they don't like him and that's why I was at Barton Springs last fall on a
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:29.640]  warm sunny day while my children were in front of me swimming and I was listening
[02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:35.160]  to three men and three women they all look like they're about 30 years old 32
[02:12:35.160 --> 02:12:41.520]  33 they were all leaving being police officers locally they didn't even say
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:46.400]  awesome they were just cops back and finished college and we're all going to
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:52.720]  work at the NSA in San Antonio they built a giant center there in the last few
[02:12:52.720 --> 02:12:59.280]  years and one in Utah and they were arrogantly laying around in the sun like
[02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:03.800]  they had announced they just won the Indy 500 and that and that they were you
[02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:09.600]  know Senna or something that they just won Formula one World Championship they

[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:39.160]  side I'm gonna have your stuff I don't want them to be there when I did this and
[02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:42.840]  I walked over very politely but very seriously and I said you ought to be a
[02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:47.680]  shame to yourselves you watch all these Hollywood movies where spies are all
[02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:51.280]  glorified and everything and you know you think you're real super sexy and

[02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:02.360]  shaking their butts I mean they were just getting off on it like it was a
[02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:08.280]  status thing I looked at them all and I said this country's gonna fall this

[02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:24.040]  justice are gonna know you ruined this country and you aided and abetted its
[02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:28.880]  destruction and they they they look scared and they should be not scared of
[02:14:28.880 --> 02:14:33.760]  me because I'm there telling them that the judgment's coming
[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:40.400]  maybe want to vomit it was a friend playing Weldon was playing at the
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:45.840]  Driscold old cattleman hotel downtown a few months ago and he invited me down
[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:50.760]  there him he and his wife did so I went down there after work one night I was
[02:14:50.760 --> 02:14:54.800]  working late he was playing at eight o'clock down there and over there here's
[02:14:54.800 --> 02:15:00.040]  some of the country music and sitting next to us was was a table a lounge
[02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:05.480]  table and I just looked at these people and I went oh man those are a bunch of
[02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:09.400]  private contractors or data miners the haircuts the way they were acting you
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:13.800]  just learn what people look like and how they act we were having a problem with
[02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:16.680]  a guy the other day and I said that guy's probably like five six tour combat
[02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:20.800]  vet on drugs out of his mind don't mess with him my buddy's like how do you know
[02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:24.240]  that he later checked and found out that was the case he's like how did you know
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:30.360]  that well I just look at the guy okay I've been doing this a while I went and
[02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:37.440]  saw two guns with Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg a few months ago by
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:43.720]  myself and the whole theater probably only had 20 people in it and I could
[02:15:43.720 --> 02:15:50.280]  look and tell it was all Marines and DEA people and CIA people all in there to
[02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:55.200]  root for these movies that are made about them mainlining the CIA brings in
[02:15:55.200 --> 02:15:58.440]  the drugs and launders the money and that there's good divisions of the
[02:15:58.440 --> 02:16:02.360]  Marines fighting them and the Naval Air Station and Corpus Christi where they're
[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:07.640]  shipping the drugs in which they really do I'm not gonna get into how I know that
[02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:12.480]  and when I walked out of the movie I went so you guys are Marines right they
[02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:15.640]  go yeah how do you know I now walk out people are going to the bathroom and I
[02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:19.480]  go you guys are army aren't you they go how do you know that and I just know
[02:16:19.480 --> 02:16:26.520]  Marines from Army I know FBI from DEA I just it's so brainwashed folks I can
[02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:36.360]  look at them and tell and I'm just sitting there for like 30 minutes
[02:16:36.360 --> 02:16:40.640]  sunbathing while my kids are swimming just listening to these cops brag about
[02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:45.000]  how they're graduating up to the NSA and their wives were so excited and oh
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:50.600]  they're going to college to do it too and I just wanted to throw up I mean
[02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:54.960]  these people are robbing me they are spying on me illegally they are using it
[02:16:54.960 --> 02:16:58.800]  to overthrow the Congress they are they are they're gonna have gun
[02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:04.960]  confiscation of FEMA camps and these cops aren't even bad people but they're
[02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:10.200]  still enemies they're still illegal criminals and and I got to be honest
[02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:17.400]  with you you know I physically was felt very aggressive towards them and I didn't
[02:17:17.400 --> 02:17:20.880]  bow up and stuff when I was talking to them but I I'm much more focused in
[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:24.320]  person and people when I really get a hold of them I mean I looked them right
[02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:28.000]  in the eyes at first they started to laugh about it and I was just like you
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:37.880]  know it's evil you know it's wrong and you need to repent basically I mean it
[02:17:37.880 --> 02:17:43.640]  isn't Jack Ryan shadow recruit okay that isn't what's going on here where it's
[02:17:43.640 --> 02:17:50.880]  the CIA is these Boy Scouts that oh they go out and they're so nice to everyone
[02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:55.760]  oh they have whole divisions of Boy Scouts that do the white hat work and
[02:17:55.760 --> 02:17:58.960]  then the guys with the black hat sit around in the office next to them
[02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:06.480]  laughing at you all day long it's like when I had Frank Serpico on I said what
[02:18:06.480 --> 02:18:15.520]  percentage of the people in the NYPD narcotics division were dealing grudge
[02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:21.840]  and skimming off the hooker money and everything else he said 100% they shot
[02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:27.440]  him in the face folks and tried to kill him because he didn't want to be part of
[02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:36.160]  narcotics and prostitution that was in the 60s again I can't believe my job I

[02:19:24.680 --> 02:19:29.520]  22-minute speech it's online with film footage
[02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:33.360]  Eisenhower was completely freaked out because they just come to him with a
[02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:38.680]  plan for a dictatorship and nuclear war with the Soviets with Curtis LeMay and
[02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:43.560]  others and L. L. Levenitzer in a plan to blow up shopping malls and shoot people

[02:22:58.760 --> 02:23:02.640]  debt is 15 trillion dollars Boston you economics professor Lawrence Kotlikoff
[02:23:02.640 --> 02:23:05.580]  astutely points out that after factoring in guarantees such as social
[02:23:05.580 --> 02:23:09.880]  security medicare medicaid and defense expenditures the national debt is closer
[02:23:09.880 --> 02:23:14.640]  to 211 trillion mathematically this debt is not serviceable via taxation and for
[02:23:14.640 --> 02:23:18.320]  politicians on Capitol Hill default is not an option so we can expect the
[02:23:18.320 --> 02:23:21.000]  Federal Reserve to monetize the short while resulting in even more

[02:24:06.040 --> 02:24:12.440]  last hour that is a news making important interview William Benny former
[02:24:12.440 --> 02:24:16.720]  head of an entire division of the National Security Agency the top whistle
[02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:23.640]  blower in probably US intelligence history highest ranking quietly quit in
[02:24:23.640 --> 02:24:29.680]  2001 in October when they said we're gonna now switch all this on and spy on
[02:24:29.680 --> 02:24:34.080]  everything in real time he said that's it I'm out of here went and testified to
[02:24:34.080 --> 02:24:38.280]  Congress for years quietly nothing was done he said look the intelligence
[02:24:38.280 --> 02:24:42.520]  agencies run the government through blackmail that's all I can tell you and
[02:24:42.520 --> 02:24:48.360]  it's totally illegal and it's a Soviet model well I've reverse engineered the
[02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:55.800]  whole thing right down to the uniforms it's a Soviet model that's what we're
[02:24:55.800 --> 02:25:01.880]  facing and they've built the FEMA camps which are now declassified as well
[02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:06.520]  again they have lawyers that go we look for things called FEMA camps they don't
[02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:10.880]  exist there are emergency centers establishment act buildings and there
[02:25:10.880 --> 02:25:16.200]  are civilian and made labor camp program and there is the garden plot and
[02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:22.360]  cable splicer and Rex 84 and the civil emergency internment plan but we
[02:25:22.360 --> 02:25:31.200]  couldn't find any FEMA camp it's like they go there's no chemtrails there is
[02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:36.000]  the high altitude geoengineering global weather mod program run by the
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:43.080]  Department of Energy that's classified but you didn't say the name rights sunny
[02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:51.440]  there is US code title 50 chapter 32 subsection 1520 a paragraph B that says
[02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:56.000]  it's illegal to secretly test chemical biological or radiological on the public
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:02.440]  without their consent unless it's for law enforcement or research purposes they
[02:26:02.440 --> 02:26:06.720]  got a law pass and they can kill you and your family I say their law is a piece
[02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:12.080]  of garbage and is an indictment of their criminal activity just because the
[02:26:12.080 --> 02:26:15.720]  serial killer writes himself a note that says he can grab little kids out of the
[02:26:15.720 --> 02:26:21.280]  backyard and go kill them doesn't mean it's okay just because Al Qaeda says
[02:26:21.280 --> 02:26:26.240]  their God says kill every Christian they find in their new magazine ISIS puts out
[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:30.640]  that I was reading yesterday online doesn't mean it makes it okay because
[02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:35.080]  they say they got a note from God there's a reason this stuff's illegal
[02:26:35.080 --> 02:26:40.040]  every two-bit dictatorship says they spy on people for their safety but it's
[02:26:40.040 --> 02:26:48.600]  always used for domination and control and all of those police officers about
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:54.240]  to become NSA minions we're all aiding and abetting criminal activity and just
[02:26:54.240 --> 02:27:00.280]  because they're slack jawed and arrogant and dumb doesn't mean it's okay let's
[02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:03.760]  talk to Wes in Indiana you're on the air west thanks for calling
[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:09.680]  hey thanks Alex for having me on today basically what I want to say is I know
[02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:13.960]  I either heard from you or read somewhere that mr. Benny was one of the
[02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:19.040]  primary programmers who had coded all these algorithms that the NSA is either
[02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:24.720]  now using or may not be using to this day I'm wondering is there any way to
[02:27:24.720 --> 02:27:31.080]  circumvent these algorithms in order to effectively collaborate with other
[02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:38.520]  activists without fear of being even eavesdropped on go ahead caller I'm
[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:46.480]  sorry basically I had heard either from you or read about mr. Benny that he had
[02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:52.000]  programmed some of these algorithms that the NSA uses to eavesdrop on American
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:58.320]  citizens and citizens abroad I was wondering if there is any way to
[02:27:58.320 --> 02:28:02.920]  circumvent these algorithms that he's not allowed he's not allowed to tell you
[02:28:02.920 --> 02:28:07.760]  that but but he was saying some of the systems that are better he is one of the

[02:33:06.440 --> 02:33:08.920]  show
[02:33:19.440 --> 02:33:23.160]  yeah sorry to that last call and all he was asking a really important question I
[02:33:23.160 --> 02:33:29.280]  was learning about Jesse Ventura I just called Ventura's people and they said
[02:33:29.280 --> 02:33:33.240]  he's on a two-day golf trip and it's told him he refuses to any interviews
[02:33:33.240 --> 02:33:39.080]  regardless of the jury came back he's obsessed with golf and surfing but that
[02:33:39.080 --> 02:33:43.360]  they said they would call him for me and see if he can come on tomorrow I'm sure
[02:33:43.360 --> 02:33:48.760]  he will he was scheduled actually next Wednesday but you know I'm sad for the
[02:33:48.760 --> 02:33:55.480]  wife of Chris Kyle but I'm also glad for Jesse Ventura because Jesse Ventura
[02:33:55.480 --> 02:34:00.720]  did not ever say he was glad that Navy SEALs died and he was not knocked out he
[02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:07.120]  was there for a commencement speech on record at a bar owned by one of the most
[02:34:07.120 --> 02:34:13.240]  famous Navy SEAL trainers and he has them all as witnesses that no
[02:34:13.240 --> 02:34:19.920]  confrontation happened nothing went on and Chris Kyle was clearly hired in a
[02:34:19.920 --> 02:34:26.200]  black-op disinformation campaign for best I know to lie and defame Jesse
[02:34:26.200 --> 02:34:29.960]  Ventura so he can't run for president down the road regardless what you think
[02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:35.160]  about it and to try to throw him out of the Navy SEAL underwater demolition
[02:34:35.160 --> 02:34:42.120]  team society that's been going on and Ventura has talked to the family talked
[02:34:42.120 --> 02:34:48.960]  to all of them he told him look you retract it I won't sue you but I've
[02:34:48.960 --> 02:34:55.480]  never met you you better stop it imagine if someone said that you were glad
[02:34:55.480 --> 02:35:00.640]  Navy SEALs were dead and they deserve to die and that you'd been knocked out for
[02:35:00.640 --> 02:35:09.600]  saying it and none of it happened this is how you defame people and I was the
[02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:12.880]  one that told Jesse Ventura when he was in Mexico I'm the one that got a hold of
[02:35:12.880 --> 02:35:20.840]  him they waited till he drove right over the Mexican border in his RV in the
[02:35:20.840 --> 02:35:25.240]  Baja knowing it took two days when he crossed the Mexican border they
[02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:31.080]  announced it against bigger than Jesse Ventura it's the anatomy of a
[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:37.560]  psychological operation with news core publishing the book putting it out
[02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:42.480]  below Riley all of them about the coward Ventura wanted SEALs to die and he
[02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:46.800]  got knocked out for saying it and the hero Chris Kyle did it it just wasn't
[02:35:46.800 --> 02:35:53.520]  true and then what happened to Chris Kyle when Ventura started winning his
[02:35:53.520 --> 02:35:59.840]  case I'm not even allowed to say how much Ventura last time I talked to him
[02:35:59.840 --> 02:36:08.760]  off-air had already spent but it's an unbelievable amount of money
[02:36:11.600 --> 02:36:16.720]  let's just say this he's not gonna probably basically get any money from
[02:36:16.720 --> 02:36:19.960]  the 1.8 million settlement
[02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:28.360]  the media spun it and lied and said how dare Jesse Ventura want to ruin a
[02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:32.960]  widow there's an insurance policy with news core she will not pay a dollar to
[02:36:32.960 --> 02:36:43.080]  Jesse Ventura but hiding behind a woman the people that pulled this
[02:36:43.080 --> 02:36:51.040]  shenanigan off and told Chris Kyle to do this need to know that they have now
[02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:56.240]  been exposed and defeated and if they try to appeal it I have no doubt that
[02:36:56.240 --> 02:37:02.120]  they're going to lose because you can't have a public figure come out and say
[02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:06.720]  that someone said I love it the Navy SEALs are dead and then that you knock
[02:37:06.720 --> 02:37:13.680]  them out designed to defame in the military community try to kick him out
[02:37:13.680 --> 02:37:18.640]  of his societies kick him out of his culture this is like saying Martin
[02:37:18.640 --> 02:37:23.520]  Luther King was a secret Ku Klux Klan member and claiming you saw Martin
[02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:28.520]  Luther King in a Ku Klux Klan outfit and you're a credible peer it'd be like if
[02:37:28.520 --> 02:37:34.320]  Martin Luther King's brother came out and said he saw him in a Ku Klux Klan
[02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:40.520]  outfit I mean it just Martin Luther King would have to sue him it's just a
[02:37:40.520 --> 02:37:46.160]  fraud it's a lie and I told opening Anthony at the time I call they called
[02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:50.320]  me that next day Andrew Ventura had been on my show on Sunday right after I told
[02:37:50.320 --> 02:37:53.440]  him on Sunday he came on my show and discussed it we ought to for the nightly
[02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:58.040]  news tonight they'll get that Sunday radio interview but Ventura was on Skype
[02:37:58.040 --> 02:38:02.320]  with us and when he was saying it's totally untrue and he's gonna get his
[02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:09.480]  name back if you could have only heard Jesse Ventura when I told him and his
[02:38:09.480 --> 02:38:13.840]  wife on Skype it was crystal clear audio I'm not even gonna repeat what what
[02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:16.880]  Jesse did when I told him
[02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:23.080]  and again you can say what you want about Ventura he's a real guy that's
[02:38:23.080 --> 02:38:26.240]  why I respect him that's why they always say he's not real and he's a fake
[02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:35.120]  because all he is is like a good old boy from Minnesota and again the reason
[02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:39.080]  this this case is important to me is justice they can come out and say
[02:38:39.080 --> 02:38:47.080]  something horrible about me folks they could set me up in a hundred different ways
[02:38:47.080 --> 02:38:51.960]  and I need people to come to my aid when that happens okay they could try to set up
[02:38:51.960 --> 02:38:58.160]  Matt Drudge or Joseph Farrah or Ron Paul or or Rand Paul you know they had
[02:38:58.160 --> 02:39:01.040]  three different cases I should do a whole report on this it's so important
[02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:06.280]  when Rand Paul beat the Republican blue blood in his Kentucky Senate primary
[02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:11.080]  campaign and the Mitch McConnell switched from trying to defeat him the
[02:39:11.080 --> 02:39:16.080]  other senator with money to you know working with him because Rand said I'm
[02:39:16.080 --> 02:39:19.160]  gonna expose you is not going for another conservative candidate if you
[02:39:19.160 --> 02:39:27.320]  don't knock this off and then they sent out Democrats dressed up in literal
[02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:32.960]  hayseed outfits overalls to say I don't like Mexicans and inwards and hold up
[02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:37.280]  signs and the national news ran with it and I said to the listeners I said you
[02:39:37.280 --> 02:39:43.560]  got to go use a Google image search on this guy I bet money it's a Democratic
[02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:46.440]  operative and it turned out in every case they were they should have all been
[02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:51.200]  sued I used to go out for land rights rallies and
[02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:56.200]  segment rallies they'd have clan guys show up that were clearly Jewish I mean
[02:39:56.200 --> 02:39:59.520]  you know the classic Jewish features and I'd say you're you're one of the Southern
[02:39:59.520 --> 02:40:02.960]  Barbie Law Center ADL they get mad and run off like we've got those videos
[02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:08.880]  somewhere guys look like rabbis or something in clan outfits I mean this
[02:40:08.880 --> 02:40:13.920]  is what the left does ladies and gentlemen and again the left right
[02:40:13.920 --> 02:40:18.760]  paradigm is false when you get outside of it but within it it's a real issue and
[02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:22.000]  the sky's the limit I mean they could have somebody that looks like me go paint
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:27.400]  swastikas on on on a black church or something I didn't do it Rand Paul
[02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:32.560]  didn't do it if they pull me over and plant drugs on me I don't use drugs
[02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:37.480]  folks I have an extremely clean lifestyle other than drinking some
[02:40:37.480 --> 02:40:41.440]  occasionally and and tobacco products which I haven't done in five years and
[02:40:41.440 --> 02:40:47.960]  I eat too much sometimes and the reason I'm going off on this jag here before I
[02:40:47.960 --> 02:40:53.720]  go to your calls is because this affects me I live under this I mean I've been
[02:40:53.720 --> 02:40:56.880]  out there and I knew it was a hit piece within 30 minutes because it was I was
[02:40:56.880 --> 02:41:01.400]  already getting calls it was already on national TV I'm at the DNC covering
[02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:06.240]  Obama they've got anarchists on me who are hitting me in the back and stuff when
[02:41:06.240 --> 02:41:10.440]  no cameras are around trying to get me to beat them up with cops waiting to
[02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:15.280]  arrest me across the street but that at the Denver Mint the Federal Reserve
[02:41:15.280 --> 02:41:23.360]  Mint and these people that later left with Michelle Malcolm would get behind
[02:41:23.360 --> 02:41:29.120]  me and scream kill Michelle Malcolm and then it was on national radio USA Today
[02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:38.680]  the next day extra that night CNN within an hour the end of Alex Jones's career
[02:41:38.680 --> 02:41:45.560]  he went up to a little lady and said to the crowd let's killer what a coward and
[02:41:45.560 --> 02:41:52.880]  they had talking points on national radio shows I'm not gonna say the name and
[02:41:52.880 --> 02:41:58.520]  the Dallas Morning News I made a bunch of newspapers retract and TV retract the
[02:41:58.520 --> 02:42:04.280]  Dallas Morning News writer who also hosts Rush Limbaugh show sometimes he told me
[02:42:04.280 --> 02:42:09.000]  in emails he said I'm never attracted nothing and I graciously didn't assume I
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:15.160]  could have gotten a defamation I could have won a lawsuit but you know I had to
[02:42:15.160 --> 02:42:18.320]  move on it wasn't as defaming as the Ventura thing because it wasn't
[02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:24.960]  publicized as much but they got photos with AP of me yelling at her when she
[02:42:24.960 --> 02:42:30.800]  was saying I was a liar because they Marines were throwing puppies off
[02:42:30.800 --> 02:42:34.880]  cliffs and she said online that I was a liar it was a robot dog and I said you
[02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:38.480]  know what that was a real dog I don't appreciate you saying I'm a liar and
[02:42:38.480 --> 02:42:44.480]  everybody was yelling at me so I was yelling back at her and so they had
[02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:48.920]  people stand behind me who later left with her saying that I said killer I
[02:42:48.920 --> 02:42:54.560]  produced the video stayed up got it online and forced retractions again these
[02:42:54.560 --> 02:43:03.280]  are the the operations they run against us ladies and gentlemen I mean for God's
[02:43:03.280 --> 02:43:06.560]  sakes they've been trying to break my family up I've been married 12 years
[02:43:06.560 --> 02:43:10.000]  they've been trying to break that up all along with all sorts of behind-the-scenes
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:17.760]  operations so I just want the public to know man bad guys run the government
[02:43:17.760 --> 02:43:23.440]  okay I've been there Dan Bongino perfect record Secret Service ran foreign
[02:43:23.440 --> 02:43:28.760]  operations very senior rising star handsome smart guy former New York
[02:43:28.760 --> 02:43:36.120]  police officer I mean they're breaking in his house they're breaking they're
[02:43:36.120 --> 02:43:39.560]  harassing his kids they're doing all sort he doesn't want to mention on air and
[02:43:39.560 --> 02:43:42.800]  give them the attention he just said I got a gun and I'm ready to break people's
[02:43:42.800 --> 02:43:49.640]  necks on the air he just said let me catch who's doing it and I don't want
[02:43:49.640 --> 02:43:51.720]  to talk about the stuff I've gone through because I'm not trying to scare you
[02:43:51.720 --> 02:43:56.360]  folks but people need to understand how real this is they're good people at the
[02:43:56.360 --> 02:44:01.280]  mid and low levels most of them are good but the globalists on top are trying to
[02:44:01.280 --> 02:44:07.080]  convince all the underlings in mid-level to go along with the lies and be part of
[02:44:07.080 --> 02:44:12.000]  dirty tricks and you'll get hung out to dry my gut tells me that that so-called
[02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:19.240]  PTSD Marine that killed Chris Kyle out at that luxury facility you think
[02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:24.640]  anybody buys that if I've ever had a shooting range and they claim some PTSD
[02:44:24.640 --> 02:44:29.920]  person shoots me in the head don't believe it
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:36.420]  Chris Kyle had outlived his usefulness and I give my condolences to his wife
[02:44:36.420 --> 02:44:41.560]  who's being manipulated and others and I tell her I'm sorry that your husband was
[02:44:41.560 --> 02:44:47.160]  basically executed to cover up the black op on Ventura but this black op on
[02:44:47.160 --> 02:44:50.960]  Ventura if it ever all comes out is the type of thing that could bring down the
[02:44:50.960 --> 02:44:56.880]  system certain type things to capture the imagination of people and I saw how
[02:44:56.880 --> 02:45:00.640]  they executed the whole Ventura operation they're scared of him that's
[02:45:00.640 --> 02:45:04.360]  why he's a run for president not that he's even right on a several issues
[02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:12.000]  he's real though and that's why they don't like it and he's just sick of it
[02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:16.480]  he's not a narcissist he doesn't want to be in the spotlight anymore he said I'm
[02:45:16.480 --> 02:45:20.720]  just riding off in the sunset Alex but he shouldn't ride off in the sunset
[02:45:20.720 --> 02:45:28.080]  because that's why they did the Chris Kyle thing let's go to your phone calls
[02:45:28.080 --> 02:45:31.720]  I'll shut up now George in Texas thanks for holding her on the air
[02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:39.520]  yeah I agree with everything you say two quick points who is responsible for
[02:45:39.520 --> 02:45:46.920]  vetting a new president what's his title what's his name who is responsible
[02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:53.920]  for vetting a new president I mean they vet them when their congressmen are
[02:45:53.920 --> 02:45:57.760]  senators or governors and they know where the bodies are buried they know
[02:45:57.760 --> 02:46:03.040]  their MO and then the establishment picks who they want to get behind
[02:46:04.680 --> 02:46:12.000]  well it's incredible to me somebody greased a grease the bar stool for this
[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:16.640]  guy to slide right into the White House no problem well that shows the
[02:46:16.640 --> 02:46:22.880]  corruption of the entire establishment I'm sick to my heart fought for this
[02:46:22.880 --> 02:46:28.600]  country US Army went to my heart over this whole thing I hear your brother
[02:46:28.600 --> 02:46:38.240]  what war were you in Korea how old are you I'm 82 well we appreciate you call
[02:46:38.240 --> 02:46:42.520]  them before you go brother this is the way corruption works people just get
[02:46:42.520 --> 02:46:47.880]  used to putting up with more and more and more until the civilization collapses
[02:46:47.880 --> 02:46:51.800]  and that's why I say this elite is out of their mind even if we had an evil
[02:46:51.800 --> 02:46:56.720]  elite before they weren't destructive of their own system and the people running
[02:46:56.720 --> 02:47:02.840]  things now are deviant they want they hate America so much that they really
[02:47:02.840 --> 02:47:07.920]  want to wreck it and that's why I want to warn people in the establishment even
[02:47:07.920 --> 02:47:11.560]  if you're not good guys and your sociopaths you should want to be
[02:47:11.560 --> 02:47:16.800]  against this because it will destabilize things there's not a lot of room at the
[02:47:16.800 --> 02:47:21.080]  top in this system this is not a good thing we're going into even from an
[02:47:21.080 --> 02:47:27.400]  evil perspective so if you're not totally turned over to evil you just have
[02:47:27.400 --> 02:47:31.520]  gone along with it for your own mercenary reasons you should not want to be
[02:47:31.520 --> 02:47:37.120]  for this folks because it's really bad there's no bottom to this thing it's as
[02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:41.200]  evil as it gets nobody should want to sign on to this I just got chills thank
[02:47:41.200 --> 02:47:47.040]  you George God bless you brother yeah I had a well my grandmother's brother
[02:47:47.040 --> 02:47:53.760]  William Pope was a senior at the Dallas Federal Reserve you know senior level
[02:47:53.760 --> 02:47:59.240]  manager from the time he got out of the Navy and did intelligence work and
[02:47:59.240 --> 02:48:05.720]  stuff after World War two and he would listen to my show in Dallas he died
[02:48:05.720 --> 02:48:12.920]  about seven years ago Uncle Billy and he would say a lot of what you're saying
[02:48:12.920 --> 02:48:16.160]  is true but a lot of it isn't by the end and he was all there when he died he had
[02:48:16.160 --> 02:48:20.760]  total IQ when he died it was just as smart as he was when I was a little kid
[02:48:20.760 --> 02:48:24.120]  he was like no it's all true you're right I looked into it I can't believe it I
[02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:28.200]  mean there are good people throughout the system it's just they they're so
[02:48:28.200 --> 02:48:33.200]  close to it they're good people so they rationalize what's going on let's go
[02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:38.000]  ahead and I had a lot of other family as well that Uncle Leonard just died a
[02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:43.360]  couple years ago and he was in Korea and he ran you know some of the biggest oil
[02:48:43.360 --> 02:48:48.000]  refineries in Houston he was very successful engineer and he was a high
[02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:52.160]  level Mason as well and he didn't believe a lot of this stuff till the near
[02:48:52.160 --> 02:48:56.600]  the time he died he was all there when he died and he was like no you're right
[02:48:56.600 --> 02:49:00.400]  about all this stuff I mean it's just incredible Fred Marilyn you're on the
[02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:06.720]  air go ahead hi Alex hey buddy I got two things I want to talk about I want to
[02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:16.560]  talk about the just turn your radio off okay talk about the impeachment of
[02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:23.120]  Obama yes are you for it or against it number one I found his impeachment
[02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:32.640]  articles on the internet brother you didn't turn your radio off I want to
[02:49:32.640 --> 02:49:37.760]  hear you but you're interrupting yourself go ahead he's being charged with three
[02:49:37.760 --> 02:49:44.160]  things are you going to be charged hopefully if he gets charged that's a
[02:49:44.160 --> 02:49:49.800]  good article to write a mock articles of impeachment against Obama and why I
[02:49:49.800 --> 02:49:53.120]  think he should be impeached we need to get on that article and get that written
[02:49:53.120 --> 02:49:56.040]  that's very well so I mean I'm sure people have done it that's what you're
[02:49:56.040 --> 02:50:02.800]  alluding to but that's a good idea identity theft is article one it has
[02:50:02.800 --> 02:50:09.480]  10 sub items to it brother I got to let you go because the radio is on I
[02:50:09.480 --> 02:50:15.080]  appreciate you but I just it's hard to understand we don't need to go with the
[02:50:15.080 --> 02:50:18.120]  identity theft even though they've run a social security number and it shows as
[02:50:18.120 --> 02:50:23.600]  a fake that's true we don't even know exactly who he is okay but you can't
[02:50:23.600 --> 02:50:28.000]  prove that cut and dry you can prove cut and dry he ran fast and furious you can
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:31.600]  prove cut and dry order to stand out in Benghazi you can prove cut and dry he's
[02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:36.080]  ordered the border to stand down we have the witnesses you can prove cut and dry
[02:50:36.080 --> 02:50:39.080]  you gave billions of energy companies that did nothing with it you can prove
[02:50:39.080 --> 02:50:42.720]  cut and dry put our military under NATO command you can prove cut and dry became
[02:50:42.720 --> 02:50:47.120]  the head of the UN Security Council violation of article one section 9 you
[02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:53.640]  prove about 50 other things so we got a impeaching even if it turns him into a

[03:00:58.280 --> 03:01:03.680]  others but marcos has been holding from brazil let's talk about gaza so you're
[03:01:03.680 --> 03:01:11.440]  up first sir go ahead any hung up robin i went to a mic in california you're on
[03:01:11.440 --> 03:01:16.400]  the air to impeach or not to impeach that is the question hello alex regarding
[03:01:16.400 --> 03:01:20.920]  impeachment this may be a pipe dream but desperate times call for desperate
[03:01:20.920 --> 03:01:26.560]  measures i just believe that we have a small window of opportunity to push the
[03:01:26.560 --> 03:01:32.320]  conversation toward a simple tyranny versus freedom debate and therefore
[03:01:32.320 --> 03:01:38.720]  impeachment must include obama biden and boner to force the conversation be on
[03:01:38.720 --> 03:01:43.240]  the right last paradigm and if that could be done regardless of whether the
[03:01:43.240 --> 03:01:47.680]  senate would conflict or not we would likely in my mind force the police state
[03:01:47.680 --> 03:01:53.280]  to be closed and give us the moral high ground as the conflict unfolds it no no
[03:01:53.280 --> 03:01:58.040]  i agree with you that look we've got a lot of reasons to impeach obama and i
[03:01:58.040 --> 03:02:02.080]  get that we could have impeached other presidents but it's getting so bad we
[03:02:02.080 --> 03:02:05.880]  need to just do it because it's the right thing to do and not just score
[03:02:05.880 --> 03:02:09.800]  political points because he's so horrible because the republican leadership is
[03:02:09.800 --> 03:02:15.720]  involved in all this as well when i want john bainer impeached i think that
[03:02:15.720 --> 03:02:20.320]  would be a very moral course would be purge the republican leadership and the
[03:02:20.320 --> 03:02:26.720]  democrats and lock their butts in prison and not have the next republican
[03:02:26.720 --> 03:02:31.920]  president or libertarian president pardon their butts i mean a bunch of nixon's
[03:02:31.920 --> 03:02:40.400]  people ended up going to prison people in his cabinet let's lock them up but if
[03:02:40.400 --> 03:02:45.040]  you don't lock up criminals they become tyrants and people say well it's not a
[03:02:45.040 --> 03:02:48.920]  pipe dream you know of course it's not a pipe dream we have open and shut reasons
[03:02:48.920 --> 03:02:55.080]  to impeach obama right now open and shut and by the way i wanted bush impeached for
[03:02:55.080 --> 03:02:59.080]  nsa and nancy polosi wouldn't do it because she was involved i mean i'm
[03:02:59.080 --> 03:03:02.480]  consistent i've had democrats on the street go i used to like you a little
[03:03:02.480 --> 03:03:06.120]  bit because you know you were for civil liberties and stuff but you know you're
[03:03:06.120 --> 03:03:14.040]  you're not for you know what going after republicans to he double hockey sticks
[03:03:14.040 --> 03:03:22.840]  i'm not i'm absolutely for going after all these people i'm sick of it i want
[03:03:22.840 --> 03:03:27.880]  to live in a free country i understand the danger of a growing tyranny i
[03:03:27.880 --> 03:03:33.040]  understand that i'm in danger just like i catch somebody trying to break in my
[03:03:33.040 --> 03:03:38.880]  house man i get really aggressive and really angry and go on a you know killer
[03:03:38.880 --> 03:03:44.760]  gorilla mode because i'm a man i take it personal when the government's turning
[03:03:44.760 --> 03:03:50.040]  into a bunch of black uniform thugs anyways well what else you want to say
[03:03:50.040 --> 03:03:55.480]  about that mike well i just wanted to pose the question of basing this whole
[03:03:55.480 --> 03:04:01.640]  impeachment on something as simple as the secret documents to install naphtha in
[03:04:01.640 --> 03:04:06.480]  the united states when it gets really confusing and it gets frantic
[03:04:06.480 --> 03:04:11.640]  but definitely the wisdom is to simplify and so if we could get it as simple as
[03:04:11.640 --> 03:04:16.600]  possible and yet go for the whole enchilada you know i think i'm going to
[03:04:16.600 --> 03:04:19.960]  get up off my butt and i because i i mean i wrote my plan for the second
[03:04:19.960 --> 03:04:24.400]  american revolution years ago got national attention constitutional law

[03:04:28.080 --> 03:04:34.640]  write i'm gonna i'm going to do it i'm gonna come up with a articles of
[03:04:34.640 --> 03:04:39.360]  impeachment for obama that's a great idea it'll go viral it'll point out the
[03:04:39.360 --> 03:04:44.000]  crimes and we can have a debate about impeachment which will focus on his
[03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:49.600]  crimes i just want the raping of the country to stop the end of the country
[03:04:49.600 --> 03:04:53.760]  the looting for the foreign banks the bailouts the the open borders the gun

[03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:48.320]  talk about the impeachment so you I would say the biggest issue with the whole thing is that if we
[03:08:48.320 --> 03:08:52.760]  don't impeach him then he's going to be able to get all these illegals that are
[03:08:52.760 --> 03:08:56.320]  able to vote and even if we do wait the two years no matter what's going to
[03:08:56.320 --> 03:09:01.360]  happen they're going to be able to vote for whoever they tell them to absolutely
[03:09:01.360 --> 03:09:05.400]  if these illegals were pro-gun pro-republic and wouldn't weren't going to go on
[03:09:05.400 --> 03:09:12.960]  welfare I would be forgiving him amnesty but they are a bunch of moms with kids
[03:09:12.960 --> 03:09:17.720]  that are going to literally vote to make me their slave I mean I would have to be
[03:09:17.720 --> 03:09:22.400]  suicidal to support this I don't care if you're black white Hispanic it doesn't
[03:09:22.400 --> 03:09:28.160]  matter people if you're tired of being loser chumps don't support this I'm so
[03:09:28.160 --> 03:09:32.760]  sick of the lottery mentality of dumb people where they just buy into whatever
[03:09:32.760 --> 03:09:37.240]  the bull is because it sounds good I mean it's just the new world order once
[03:09:37.240 --> 03:09:43.160]  open borders everywhere for a reason to literally turn us all into third world
[03:09:43.160 --> 03:09:47.960]  slaves and I feel sorry and empathize for those third world slaves and I really
[03:09:47.960 --> 03:09:51.760]  feel bad that I can't figure out a political way to help these people but
[03:09:51.760 --> 03:09:57.000]  you can't help them just like a lifeboat that can hold a hundred people it
[03:09:57.000 --> 03:10:01.680]  sinks when you put a hundred and twenty in it the boats already sinking we
[03:10:01.680 --> 03:10:07.720]  already got too many in Switzerland doesn't let you in if you're rich and
[03:10:07.720 --> 03:10:14.320]  white folks and they literally are so successful they're just bathing and
[03:10:14.320 --> 03:10:19.560]  money and wealth and there's other countries like that as well you know
[03:10:19.560 --> 03:10:23.240]  they won't let a rich black guy in unless he's got some big skills they can
[03:10:23.240 --> 03:10:27.360]  bring they don't care what color you are they want you to have a bunch of skills
[03:10:27.360 --> 03:10:31.080]  if you're a nuclear physicist and make a bunch of patents you don't have money
[03:10:31.080 --> 03:10:35.280]  they'll let you into Switzerland if you're a professor and have written a
[03:10:35.280 --> 03:10:38.400]  bunch of best-selling books they'll let you into Switzerland if you're Richard
[03:10:38.400 --> 03:10:42.960]  scary and write children's books they'll let you into Switzerland but if you just
[03:10:42.960 --> 03:10:46.720]  have five million dollars they might not let you into Switzerland and that's
[03:10:46.720 --> 03:10:50.280]  what it comes down to because they're not idiots they care about their country
[03:10:50.280 --> 03:10:56.720]  and again we're bordering failed third world nations we it's suicidal go ahead
[03:10:56.720 --> 03:11:02.920]  I'm sorry I just got a question for you let's say we did impeach him would you
[03:11:02.920 --> 03:11:07.400]  say that we could even send the legal back is that even possible absolutely
[03:11:07.400 --> 03:11:11.360]  you load them on planes and you deport them to their country of origin that
[03:11:11.360 --> 03:11:16.520]  cost a few thousand dollars maximum instead of millions of dollars for all
[03:11:16.520 --> 03:11:20.320]  the tuition and all the school lunch programs and all the welfare and all
[03:11:20.320 --> 03:11:25.400]  the rest of it so then their kids can be taught about gangster bang bang music
[03:11:25.400 --> 03:11:29.640]  on MTV meant to totally screw their minds up so they can be prepared for the
[03:11:29.640 --> 03:11:35.640]  prison population well that's not really what I mean by that question what I
[03:11:35.640 --> 03:11:39.720]  mean is let's say we did impeach him how far down we have to go for someone to
[03:11:39.720 --> 03:11:44.640]  actually be able to do that it doesn't matter it scares all the criminals so
[03:11:44.640 --> 03:11:48.040]  they would just hold on we don't just impeach Obama you take down the front
[03:11:48.040 --> 03:11:54.000]  man politically and we can arrest Lois Lerner and died her she'll go to
[03:11:54.000 --> 03:11:58.000]  prison I mean I can go as a prosecutor right now just you be going to prison
[03:11:58.000 --> 03:12:00.720]  I mean the evidence is all on record they've already been caught lying about
[03:12:00.720 --> 03:12:04.160]  it boom we have her on obstruction we have her on absconding we have her on
[03:12:04.160 --> 03:12:07.840]  destruction of evidence we have her on wire fraud I mean the list just goes on
[03:12:07.840 --> 03:12:13.160]  or not just all of them you could all have federal trials and put I don't know
[03:12:13.160 --> 03:12:15.920]  I don't want to put them in FEMA camps or anything because that would be
[03:12:15.920 --> 03:12:20.440]  turning into them I'd say we probably put 5,000 of them in prison we could
[03:12:20.440 --> 03:12:24.840]  evict almost every one of them open and shut I mean look at the former head of
[03:12:24.840 --> 03:12:29.240]  the EPA had fake email accounts committing criminal operations under fake
[03:12:29.240 --> 03:12:36.440]  names of course she did premeditated criminal operations under fake names
[03:12:36.440 --> 03:12:41.400]  send her to prison all of them slap their ass in prison I appreciate your
[03:12:41.400 --> 03:12:45.280]  call and again I don't have some hatred of them let me tell you these are
[03:12:45.280 --> 03:12:48.680]  dangerous people I don't like getting up here to mafia dons and saying put them
[03:12:48.680 --> 03:12:52.760]  in prison but they're destroying my country and your country they're not
[03:12:52.760 --> 03:12:58.120]  giving us any way out folks they're not gonna back off it's just like when
[03:12:58.120 --> 03:13:01.920]  you're 12 years old you're walking home from the bus stop in three bullies that
[03:13:01.920 --> 03:13:07.960]  are 16 get around you and start punching you in the head you might as well when
[03:13:07.960 --> 03:13:12.200]  they tackle you go ahead and bite them on the calf and buy a big bloody chunk
[03:13:12.200 --> 03:13:15.520]  out they're never gonna mess with you again I did that when I was 12 these
[03:13:15.520 --> 03:13:18.880]  guys were beating on me stomping on me I tried to stand up and fist fight them they
[03:13:18.880 --> 03:13:21.400]  were bigger than me they held me down we're punching me in the head I just
[03:13:21.400 --> 03:13:25.720]  reached over and bet a huge chunk out of the guy's leg tried to sue my parents
[03:13:25.720 --> 03:13:31.320]  and the cops came and they said no they attacked your son I mean you got the
[03:13:31.320 --> 03:13:34.040]  will to buy a big bloody chunk out of somebody you can kick the New World
[03:13:34.040 --> 03:13:37.800]  Order's ass they're not giving us a choice ladies and gentlemen and I'm
[03:13:37.800 --> 03:13:42.880]  politically biting chunks right now you got somebody sitting on top of you can't
[03:13:42.880 --> 03:13:48.040]  breathe bite them they're not giving us a way out don't people understand that
[03:13:48.040 --> 03:13:55.600]  they're pushing they're asking for it they're not gonna back off people don't
[03:13:55.600 --> 03:14:01.800]  you get it they're in the choice they're going for broke cuz they know they're
[03:14:01.800 --> 03:14:05.680]  all going to prison if we turn this around the only way they feel safe is
[03:14:05.680 --> 03:14:08.560]  bankrupting you and your family and putting checkpoints at every street
[03:14:08.560 --> 03:14:13.080]  corner with men in black uniforms you want to live in that country huh cops that
[03:14:13.080 --> 03:14:17.200]  where you want to live too let's go ahead and talk to Phil in Ohio you're on
[03:14:17.200 --> 03:14:26.720]  the air God bless you Alex pray for you and yours daily education is the key
[03:14:26.720 --> 03:14:33.240]  what you've been doing for 19 years eventually we're gonna get these rat
[03:14:33.240 --> 03:14:41.040]  bastards and we can start with a council on foreign relations Obama to get him
[03:14:41.040 --> 03:14:47.720]  impeached all you need to do is read the articles of the Constitution and look
[03:14:47.720 --> 03:14:53.640]  at his record and you could send him down the road for treason get him on
[03:14:53.640 --> 03:15:00.640]  trial and hang is no good but well that would certainly send a message and for
[03:15:00.640 --> 03:15:04.240]  the secret service that's not a threat because anybody can be convicted the
[03:15:04.240 --> 03:15:07.880]  president's not above the law and if you are convicted of treason or high treason
[03:15:07.880 --> 03:15:12.000]  that is the that is the penalty I think that would turn him into a martyr we
[03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:19.560]  should send him to an island like we did Napoleon well sending somewhere to
[03:15:19.560 --> 03:15:26.680]  jail would be best and then huh that's all I got don't quit I won't I won't
[03:15:26.680 --> 03:15:35.400]  quit I won't quit thank you we can't quit they're not gonna stop folks they're
[03:15:35.400 --> 03:15:39.480]  not gonna stop I mean we haven't attacked anybody they're getting ready to blow
[03:15:39.480 --> 03:15:44.760]  stuff up and blame it on us don't attack them don't attack their minions that
[03:15:44.760 --> 03:15:50.240]  helps them deprogram their minions crystal in Maryland thanks for holding
[03:15:50.240 --> 03:15:56.760]  your on the air hi Alex I have a quick question I'm a federal employee and I'm
[03:15:56.760 --> 03:16:02.600]  kind of I'm really concerned about retirements in this country and I'm
[03:16:02.600 --> 03:16:06.240]  thinking about which all in my retirement because I feel like the
[03:16:06.240 --> 03:16:12.160]  every you know the government's about ready to collapse and I wonder if you
[03:16:12.160 --> 03:16:19.160]  had any insight on that and I read a while back that Monsanto was in control
[03:16:19.160 --> 03:16:26.000]  of all federal months federal retirement plans and if you had any more
[03:16:26.000 --> 03:16:31.160]  information about that well I know that federal retirement plans a lot of them
[03:16:31.160 --> 03:16:34.760]  they're not all invested in one place I know Monsanto is involved in it I know
[03:16:34.760 --> 03:16:37.880]  a bunch of other shady banks are and they've already changed the laws
[03:16:37.880 --> 03:16:44.400]  bipartisanly in 2005 to quote protect your pensions they've changed the laws
[03:16:44.400 --> 03:16:47.680]  where they can take part of them and what they're gonna do is take part of
[03:16:47.680 --> 03:16:53.080]  them and bites kind of a bail in to quote protect them and so I am aware of
[03:16:53.080 --> 03:16:57.680]  that going on and I was aware of Monsanto being involved in some of the
[03:16:57.680 --> 03:17:03.760]  management with some other companies so yes okay I want to just thank you for
[03:17:03.760 --> 03:17:07.520]  all the information that you're putting out for us and I've been a long-time
[03:17:07.520 --> 03:17:11.920]  listener and thank you for trying to wake up America well thank you man please
[03:17:11.920 --> 03:17:15.680]  don't thank me though because it's like thanking somebody for bailing a life
[03:17:15.680 --> 03:17:21.520]  raft that's got a hole in it I mean we're all in this together but but thank
[03:17:21.520 --> 03:17:24.920]  you so much God bless you yeah you could say I've been radicalized we're gonna
[03:17:24.920 --> 03:17:27.920]  skip this network break go to the bottom of the hour you could say I've been
[03:17:27.920 --> 03:17:33.960]  radicalized by all the stuff they've done to me and by the things I've seen
[03:17:33.960 --> 03:17:39.920]  them do they would say you know I have PTSD or something from seeing CPS take
[03:17:39.920 --> 03:17:44.320]  people's kids for no reason and seeing mothers cry in the court and being
[03:17:44.320 --> 03:17:47.960]  physically attacked and being put through the propaganda ringer that's not
[03:17:47.960 --> 03:17:54.400]  PTSD that is becoming hardened to the enemy and disliking them and having a
[03:17:54.400 --> 03:17:59.880]  normal dislike of them just like if I caught a rattlesnake in my house I'm
[03:17:59.880 --> 03:18:04.120]  gonna kill it that's not some disorder that I have an instinct to want to kill
[03:18:04.120 --> 03:18:10.600]  it it's the fact that I know what a bunch of nasty scum we're dealing with and I
[03:18:10.600 --> 03:18:14.120]  realize it's only gonna get worse I think about all the innocent people they're
[03:18:14.120 --> 03:18:18.800]  having their way with and I'm tired of it I'm sick of it I'm sick of them
[03:18:18.800 --> 03:18:22.560]  always winning the average person has had their normal instincts to want to
[03:18:22.560 --> 03:18:26.800]  fight tyranny put into football to where guys get so excited when their team
[03:18:26.800 --> 03:18:30.240]  wins and they're on cloud nine for a week when they win the Super Bowl and
[03:18:30.240 --> 03:18:34.880]  they feel like they've accomplished something I want to see the New World
[03:18:34.880 --> 03:18:41.080]  Order fall I want to see a better future for humanity not because I'm a good
[03:18:41.080 --> 03:18:49.560]  person and I'm not saying I'm not a good person but it's not about me folks you
[03:18:49.560 --> 03:18:54.080]  should instinctively hate tyranny you should instinctively be disgusted by
[03:18:54.080 --> 03:19:00.160]  oppression you should instinctively not like bullies you should instinctively
[03:19:00.160 --> 03:19:06.560]  want to stand up against it and that's not I mean again I've seen people that
[03:19:06.560 --> 03:19:11.200]  stop at car wrecks or stop when somebody's choking and everybody thinks
[03:19:11.200 --> 03:19:13.880]  them because they do the Heimlich maneuver or thanks them because they
[03:19:13.880 --> 03:19:19.760]  stop at a car wreck what the hell do you expect me to do I mean I want you to
[03:19:19.760 --> 03:19:23.200]  help me when I'm in trouble
[03:19:24.960 --> 03:19:29.440]  we've just become domesticated folks that's why we don't have our normal
[03:19:29.440 --> 03:19:34.280]  instincts we need to get back to our normal instincts that the system wants
[03:19:34.280 --> 03:19:40.760]  to deprogram out of us I guarantee you go to some Brazilian rainforest tribe and
[03:19:40.760 --> 03:19:44.640]  start trying to tell them what to do they're gonna try to kill you you go to
[03:19:44.640 --> 03:19:48.000]  New Guinea and try to sell some tribe what to do that I can go along with you
[03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:51.280]  go anywhere where there's quote free people they're not gonna be told what
[03:19:51.280 --> 03:19:56.560]  to do by you we've been taught it's bizarre to not want to have your lives
[03:19:56.560 --> 03:20:03.440]  run by somebody else if we had good people trying to run our lives I'd be
[03:20:03.440 --> 03:20:06.880]  against it because it always turns bad but we've already gotten to the bad face
[03:20:06.880 --> 03:20:11.680]  here and now it's getting down right nasty I know I just keep repeating the
[03:20:11.680 --> 03:20:18.160]  same thing I just bad people are running the top you can't fix it the only way
[03:20:18.160 --> 03:20:22.160]  to reverse it is to arrest the establishment and then you got to have
[03:20:22.160 --> 03:20:29.880]  trials but they've all committed crimes show out in the open I don't care they've
[03:20:29.880 --> 03:20:33.720]  had government boards sign off on torture and sign off on illegal spying
[03:20:33.720 --> 03:20:40.320]  and they've got good reasons for it blah blah blah bull bull let's go to your
[03:20:40.320 --> 03:20:45.120]  calls let's go to Marcus in Brazil was able to get back on then we'll go to
[03:20:45.120 --> 03:20:50.960]  Robert and Dan go ahead Marcus in Brazil you're on the air hello Alex
[03:20:50.960 --> 03:20:55.800]  hi buddy sir good man good to have you calm and first of all I want to say you
[03:20:55.800 --> 03:20:59.960]  do a wonderful work and I'm a big fan of your work well thank you for putting up
[03:20:59.960 --> 03:21:05.240]  with me yeah and people here when I try to explain to them what's going on in
[03:21:05.240 --> 03:21:08.880]  the world they call me crazy of course they do because they don't want to
[03:21:08.880 --> 03:21:14.880]  admit it's happening yeah and I was about to ask you what do you think the
[03:21:14.880 --> 03:21:19.480]  this war on God you think the US government it's supporting Israel
[03:21:19.480 --> 03:21:24.680]  financing them to keep this war going on yes and they have a fake tit for tat
[03:21:24.680 --> 03:21:30.480]  going where Kerry will criticize Israel then Israel say shut up Obama to make
[03:21:30.480 --> 03:21:34.040]  it look like it's a left to right versus steel but it's even more
[03:21:34.040 --> 03:21:37.840]  sophisticated than that you've got globalist interest trying to stir Gaza
[03:21:37.840 --> 03:21:46.120]  up Israel blew up the Gaza strips power plant today which is a war crime when
[03:21:46.120 --> 03:21:50.480]  you're fighting asymmetrical warfare and I was against our government bombing
[03:21:50.480 --> 03:21:56.440]  Belgrade in Serbia and blowing up their power plant and I am against Israel
[03:21:56.440 --> 03:22:00.600]  bombing power plants because that's what supplies men women and children with
[03:22:00.600 --> 03:22:05.920]  heating and cooling and the hospitals and it's against the Geneva Convention but
[03:22:05.920 --> 03:22:10.360]  Israel is not a signatory to that or the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act they're
[03:22:10.360 --> 03:22:14.840]  not a signatory to any of it and that's their business I don't think sovereign
[03:22:14.840 --> 03:22:19.360]  countries should have to sign on to stuff but it is a war crime to bomb a
[03:22:19.360 --> 03:22:26.140]  power plant unless the power plant is delivering power directly to an official
[03:22:26.140 --> 03:22:32.680]  munitions facility now again notice Obama is shutting off our power plants
[03:22:32.680 --> 03:22:38.880]  with carbon taxes and with regulations which is an act of war as well and it's
[03:22:38.880 --> 03:22:45.640]  beyond an act of war it is a crime against humanity so I mean what do you do
[03:22:45.640 --> 03:22:50.480]  about Gaza I understand it's tribal warfare it doesn't look good to have
[03:22:50.480 --> 03:22:56.280]  tanks you know running over people that are throwing rocks I always support you
[03:22:56.280 --> 03:23:04.840]  know the underdog but at the same time my issue is well I've already told people
[03:23:04.840 --> 03:23:10.920]  my issue with Gaza I'm concerned about the thousand civilians killed it sticks
[03:23:10.920 --> 03:23:15.720]  in my gut what's going on but at the same time no one wants to talk about
[03:23:15.720 --> 03:23:20.200]  hundreds of thousands killed by ISIS or by Al Qaeda that our own government's
[03:23:20.200 --> 03:23:23.880]  backing so you see it's like I don't automatically obsess on the thing they
[03:23:23.880 --> 03:23:28.560]  want me to obsess on do you see what I'm saying yeah what do you think about
[03:23:28.560 --> 03:23:37.200]  Gaza well I think this is the question that I that I was asking I think the US
[03:23:37.200 --> 03:23:43.000]  government is behind us oh I agree with you do you know absolutely yeah they're
[03:23:43.000 --> 03:23:48.240]  doing this to blame the the people from Gaza the Palestinians oh you think
[03:23:48.240 --> 03:23:54.040]  they're launching false flags yeah there have been instances of Israel caught
[03:23:54.040 --> 03:23:59.840]  in fake terror attacks before that's come out in UPI AP and Reuters Jerusalem
[03:23:59.840 --> 03:24:03.400]  Post and her it's show if you've been caught doing it before you could be a
[03:24:03.400 --> 03:24:08.720]  suspect the problem is the head of Hamas says we will not coexist with Israel
[03:24:08.720 --> 03:24:12.800]  and admits they're shooting the rockets so then there's the issue of who's
[03:24:12.800 --> 03:24:17.600]  funding Hamas and it is true the same globalist that we talk about are in
[03:24:17.600 --> 03:24:22.360]  there funding Hamas so then the question is why would Hamas fire rockets
[03:24:22.360 --> 03:24:31.160]  giving Israel the pretext to destroy the infrastructure of the Gaza strip yeah
[03:24:31.160 --> 03:24:37.080]  I think that all right well I appreciate your call from down there in
[03:24:37.080 --> 03:24:42.360]  Brazil that's one of the few games I watched a World Cup as I was a friends
[03:24:42.360 --> 03:24:46.200]  outs that happened to be on that's when I remarked it was like I like having
[03:24:46.200 --> 03:24:49.440]  golf on the background even I don't play a lot of golf grew up playing golf but
[03:24:49.440 --> 03:24:55.840]  never have time to and just like I kind of like the sound of the field and the
[03:24:55.840 --> 03:24:59.680]  birds tweeting and the announcer only talks a little bit and the whack of the
[03:24:59.680 --> 03:25:04.600]  ball it like it doesn't dominate it's just something on the background almost
[03:25:04.600 --> 03:25:09.120]  like elevator music that you occasionally look at I can watch baseball that way
[03:25:09.120 --> 03:25:12.080]  to I used to I like baseball folks let's never watch it anymore because I got
[03:25:12.080 --> 03:25:14.480]  more serious stuff to do because it's like you don't really pay attention to
[03:25:14.480 --> 03:25:18.640]  baseball you just kind of oh now a pitcher gets up or this hitter you want
[03:25:18.640 --> 03:25:22.760]  to see gets up it doesn't dominate your attention
[03:25:22.760 --> 03:25:26.800]  like a good place to have a business meeting is a baseball game but I won't
[03:25:26.800 --> 03:25:31.720]  go to him because I'm not gonna have my genitals grabbed that's my protest and
[03:25:31.720 --> 03:25:36.160]  again isn't my god now football is different because you watch it pretty
[03:25:36.160 --> 03:25:41.080]  much the whole time and the dancing robots and the obnoxiousness and and then
[03:25:41.080 --> 03:25:47.560]  the pro-Obama statements I mean I just cannot watch NFL football I just cannot
[03:25:47.560 --> 03:25:53.080]  do it ladies and gentlemen let's go ahead and talk to Robert and Alabama
[03:25:53.080 --> 03:25:57.800]  you're on the air go ahead hey Alex it's nice to talk to you for the first
[03:25:57.800 --> 03:26:04.760]  time well I got an email last night and I get them from like called town hall
[03:26:04.760 --> 03:26:12.640]  spotlight and basically the topic is 36 US cities and 20 states dump the dollar
[03:26:12.640 --> 03:26:20.720]  and if you click on it Warren Buffett's name is in it and saying he should people
[03:26:20.720 --> 03:26:26.960]  should fear paper money and then they go on to a video where it says basically
[03:26:26.960 --> 03:26:33.920]  there people are switching to Edison's renegade currency I didn't know if you've
[03:26:33.920 --> 03:26:38.800]  heard that or if it's even important I'll look it up but I know Buffett's been
[03:26:38.800 --> 03:26:43.040]  betting against the stock market and against the dollar now and so is that
[03:26:43.040 --> 03:26:53.040]  perennial demon Soros and again what a group of crooks that's all I can say I
[03:26:53.040 --> 03:26:58.040]  mean Warren Buffett don't get me started number one beneficiary of the bailout
[03:26:58.040 --> 03:27:03.480]  pays almost no taxes helped write the laws in the 90s to do that then gets up
[03:27:03.480 --> 03:27:08.360]  on TV and goes I pay almost no tax my secretary pays more raise them on me and
[03:27:08.360 --> 03:27:13.120]  then the bill that he supports doesn't raise them on him it raises it on the
[03:27:13.120 --> 03:27:16.920]  middle class and poor people because he wants that money and bailout money to
[03:27:16.920 --> 03:27:22.840]  himself but he acts like a nice old man and so people go well he's a nice old
[03:27:22.840 --> 03:27:29.080]  man and it's just total camouflage I'll look into it Robert appreciate your
[03:27:29.080 --> 03:27:37.360]  call Dan in New Mexico you're on the air go ahead hey Alex couple things yes we
[03:27:37.360 --> 03:27:41.160]  should impeach we should impeach Obama and the whole thing will begin to
[03:27:41.160 --> 03:27:46.080]  unravel after that some definitely in support of impeachment right now
[03:27:46.080 --> 03:27:50.920]  regardless of the political consequences if somebody just stands up for the truth
[03:27:50.920 --> 03:27:58.080]  in what we call our government they're going to be lauded as heroes and that's
[03:27:58.080 --> 03:28:04.920]  what they don't understand unfortunately the second thing about the border
[03:28:04.920 --> 03:28:10.160]  situation and I want to credit Chris and a halt to help me come to this
[03:28:10.160 --> 03:28:16.960]  realization about how precious liberty really is and the whole history of the
[03:28:16.960 --> 03:28:24.120]  Bill of Rights going back 700 years and Magna Cardo had a clue and you know the
[03:28:24.120 --> 03:28:30.080]  great remonstration etc etc oh yeah I mean people think that 1776 was an
[03:28:30.080 --> 03:28:34.920]  anti-British thing no it wasn't it was a continuation of the rebellions that had
[03:28:34.920 --> 03:28:40.320]  gone on for hundreds of years in England and Scotland and Ireland and and so
[03:28:40.320 --> 03:28:46.040]  that's why I gave a speech there outside London to 4,000 people almost and they
[03:28:46.040 --> 03:28:51.280]  were chanting 1776 a bunch of Brits because they got it and understood it in
[03:28:51.280 --> 03:28:58.640]  the speech and that's powerful folks I said 1776 belongs to you and then they
[03:28:58.640 --> 03:29:03.680]  had Oxford and what's the other big one ox the Cambridge have asked me both to
[03:29:03.680 --> 03:29:08.000]  come speak I'm not bragging I just haven't had time to do it but I need to
[03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:11.240]  set up that English trip because I like that and I tell you they're ready for
[03:29:11.240 --> 03:29:15.080]  freedom over there folks and they like the fact that I bypass all that
[03:29:15.080 --> 03:29:21.720]  propaganda but Dan very very interesting anything else yeah I would highly
[03:29:21.720 --> 03:29:26.000]  recommend that you get Chris Dan Hall on the show she was the attorney in
[03:29:26.000 --> 03:29:31.400]  Florida who lost her job in 2009 because she refused to cow-tow to her boss who
[03:29:31.400 --> 03:29:35.760]  told her to stop or lose her job and since that time she's been on a mission
[03:29:35.760 --> 03:29:39.560]  she travels 265 days we're looking to getting her on hey great job with the
[03:29:39.560 --> 03:29:42.840]  crew that was three and a half hours of radio nightly news tonight seven o'clock
[03:29:42.840 --> 03:29:57.480]  prisonplanet.tv God bless you all we'll see you back tomorrow Lord Willem
