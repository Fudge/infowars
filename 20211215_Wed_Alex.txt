[00:00.000 --> 00:10.160]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:10.160 --> 00:15.600]  Studies from the Centers for Disease Control, the Food and Drug Administration, and the American
[00:15.600 --> 00:23.240]  Heart Association all indicate that mRNA COVID vaccines are causing cardiovascular diseases.
[00:23.240 --> 00:29.560]  However, according to the Evening Standard, up to 300,000 people in the United Kingdom
[00:29.560 --> 00:36.680]  are facing heart-related illnesses due to PPSD, Post-Pandemic Stress Disorder.
[00:36.680 --> 00:43.040]  Based on the testimony of two London physicians, Mark Rainer and Tahir Hussein, the sharp rise
[00:43.040 --> 00:50.280]  in cardiovascular cases, especially among 30 to 45-year-olds, is due to stress and anxiety
[00:50.280 --> 00:53.640]  caused by living during the COVID pandemic.
[00:53.640 --> 00:59.760]  And no, the doctors do not blame the media and politicians for hyping up fear amongst
[00:59.760 --> 01:05.560]  their citizens, even though that would support their PPSD narrative extremely well.
[01:05.560 --> 01:11.840]  But why don't the physicians blame the widely administered and experimental mRNA COVID vaccine
[01:11.840 --> 01:14.720]  for the rise in heart-related illnesses?
[01:14.720 --> 01:21.680]  On November 8, 2021, the American Heart Association posted in their online journal a warning about
[01:21.680 --> 01:29.440]  the direct correlation between mRNA vaccines and an increased risk in cardiovascular diseases.
[01:29.440 --> 01:35.040]  Their study concludes that the mRNA vaccines dramatically increase inflammation in the
[01:35.040 --> 01:38.560]  tissue that lines blood vessels and the heart.
[01:38.560 --> 01:45.020]  The mRNA vaccines also account for the observations of increased thrombosis, which occurs when
[01:45.020 --> 01:50.360]  blood clots block veins or arteries and can cause strokes or heart attacks.
[01:50.360 --> 01:56.160]  An increase of cardiomyopathy was also observed, a disease of the heart muscle that makes it
[01:56.160 --> 02:00.040]  harder for your body to pump blood to the rest of the body.
[02:00.040 --> 02:06.760]  On November 12, 2021, the Centers for Disease Control published an article titled, Myocarditis
[02:06.760 --> 02:14.960]  and Pericarditis after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, which states, quote, Myocarditis is inflammation
[02:14.960 --> 02:20.320]  of the heart muscle and Pericarditis is inflammation of the outer lining of the heart.
[02:20.320 --> 02:26.240]  In both cases, the body's immune system causes inflammation in response to an infection or
[02:26.240 --> 02:28.120]  some other trigger.
[02:28.120 --> 02:29.120]  Some other trigger.
[02:29.120 --> 02:34.560]  Clearly, the mRNA vaccine is the trigger to this heart disease, as stated in their own
[02:34.560 --> 02:35.560]  headline.
[02:35.560 --> 02:42.760]  The CDC even warns that Myocarditis and Pericarditis is prevalent, quote, especially in adolescents
[02:42.760 --> 02:48.200]  and young adult males within several days after COVID-19 vaccination.
[02:48.200 --> 02:54.480]  After mRNA COVID vaccination, either Pfizer, BioNTech or Moderna, more often after the
[02:54.480 --> 02:59.200]  second dose and usually within a week of vaccination.
[02:59.200 --> 03:05.080]  Over a year ago, at the end of October in 2020, the Food and Drug Administration's Product
[03:05.080 --> 03:10.440]  Advisory Committee even identified all of these threats to heart health from the COVID
[03:10.440 --> 03:16.520]  vaccine, but decided to allow its administration to populations around the world anyway.
[03:16.520 --> 03:23.080]  During the FDA's committee meeting, a slide was briefly revealed titled, FDA Safety Surveillance
[03:23.080 --> 03:30.040]  of COVID-19 Vaccines, Draft Working List of Possible Adverse Event Outcomes.
[03:30.040 --> 03:37.000]  This long list of vaccine side effects included the same two illnesses identified by the CDC,
[03:37.000 --> 03:39.480]  Myocarditis and Pericarditis.
[03:39.480 --> 03:46.060]  It also included the American Heart Association's observation of increased thrombosis, identified
[03:46.060 --> 03:51.480]  as venous thrombolombalism, which is when a blood clot forms in a deep vein.
[03:51.480 --> 03:57.120]  The FDA also lists another blood clotting disorder called disseminated intravascular
[03:57.120 --> 04:02.760]  coagulation, which causes abnormal blood clotting throughout the body's blood vessels.
[04:02.760 --> 04:08.440]  Aside from heart attacks, obstructed blood vessels also account for about 87 percent
[04:08.440 --> 04:15.520]  of all strokes, which is also named by the FDA as an adverse event from the COVID vaccines.
[04:15.520 --> 04:21.720]  So with such clear evidence of cardiovascular diseases, why are the mRNA and other COVID
[04:21.720 --> 04:26.120]  vaccines still being administered to the public worldwide?
[04:26.120 --> 04:31.520]  Is this why vaccinated athletes around the world have been collapsing and suddenly dying
[04:31.520 --> 04:34.560]  in the middle of a cardio-heavy performance?
[04:34.560 --> 04:39.440]  Maybe this is all because of post-pandemic stress disorder, and trying to identify any
[04:39.440 --> 04:45.040]  other culprit for the uptick in heart disease will only stress us out even further, causing
[04:45.040 --> 04:46.920]  our hearts to explode.
[04:46.920 --> 04:53.400]  I guess we should be good little globalists, get in line and take our boosters this Christmas
[04:53.400 --> 04:55.040]  and for years to come.
[04:55.040 --> 05:25.000]  This is Brian Wilson with infowars.com.
[05:25.200 --> 05:27.460]  It's the job structure and American jobs.
[05:27.460 --> 05:30.240]  It is the true digital economy.
[05:30.240 --> 05:35.520]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcending or control.
[05:35.520 --> 05:41.200]  I've been on there 28 years, and all of our work has been amazing, thanks to God and God's
[05:41.200 --> 05:42.840]  divine empowerment and blessing.
[05:42.840 --> 05:47.560]  But I gotta tell you out of everything I've done, reset Wash is the most important, and
[05:47.560 --> 05:54.480]  it is now available of the month of December, 2021, is here at resetwash.com.
[05:54.480 --> 06:10.700]  Start your journey to the next level today at resetwars.com, the globalist fear, this
[06:10.700 --> 06:11.700]  information.
[06:11.700 --> 06:13.820]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[06:13.820 --> 06:19.540]  Live from Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[06:19.540 --> 06:26.280]  Well, the good news is there is a large portion of humanity of every race, color and creed
[06:26.280 --> 06:29.040]  that is awake and knows what's going on.
[06:29.040 --> 06:32.160]  It's always an informed minority that stops tyranny in the end.
[06:32.160 --> 06:36.520]  The bad news is the globalist out of desperation have pulled the trigger with their worldwide
[06:36.520 --> 06:42.320]  lockdowns and from Australia to Germany to the UK to Canada, they're saying, hey, the
[06:42.320 --> 06:46.280]  shots never stop and you always wear the mask and we're just going to lock you down all
[06:46.280 --> 06:49.000]  the time no matter how many shots you take.
[06:49.000 --> 06:55.560]  This is our journey into martial law, ladies and gentlemen, and the good news is we have
[06:55.560 --> 07:03.520]  one of the top orthodox leaders coming out saying it's a new world order criminal takeover.
[07:03.520 --> 07:10.140]  We have the top German cardinal who's also the head of the Vatican court coming out and
[07:10.140 --> 07:13.080]  saying everything I've said word for word, basically.
[07:13.080 --> 07:14.880]  You've got Tucker Carlson saying it.
[07:14.880 --> 07:19.080]  You've got countless people getting it, Dr. Peter McCullough has gone super viral on Joe
[07:19.080 --> 07:20.080]  Rogan.
[07:20.080 --> 07:24.160]  It's now over 50 million views on different platforms with his life saving three hour
[07:24.160 --> 07:29.200]  interview just devastating the new world order and saying this is purposeful.
[07:29.200 --> 07:30.200]  This is all by design.
[07:30.200 --> 07:31.680]  Obviously, we've had private discussions.
[07:31.680 --> 07:40.000]  He knows that but now he's going public with it devastating to their operation devastating
[07:40.000 --> 07:43.880]  because when you figure out this was all a plan on purpose, then you understand how
[07:43.880 --> 07:47.440]  much trouble we're in that you're going to have to do to break with the system and say
[07:47.440 --> 07:50.480]  no and that giving in and submitting only makes it worse.
[07:50.480 --> 07:56.120]  Meanwhile, there's just so much crazy news.
[07:56.120 --> 08:00.600]  The federal government has officially announced that highways are racist and they're going
[08:00.600 --> 08:04.680]  to start tearing them down, not just not repairing them.
[08:04.680 --> 08:10.200]  And the Salvation Army has seen its donations be cut in almost half after they send out
[08:10.200 --> 08:15.720]  to their donors saying you're evil white people, you need to give money to Salvation Army because
[08:15.720 --> 08:16.720]  you're racist.
[08:16.720 --> 08:20.320]  And people are like, I've been given to you for decades, in some cases millions of dollars.
[08:20.320 --> 08:22.440]  You insult me like this, screw you.
[08:22.440 --> 08:28.800]  I mean, go, walk, get broke or get woke, go broke.
[08:28.800 --> 08:31.720]  There's that type of news and then there's stuff like this.
[08:31.720 --> 08:37.880]  Senator Blumenthal speaks at Communist Award Show, this is Fox News, touts build back better.
[08:37.880 --> 08:43.720]  He's the guy that runs the law firm that's running the lawsuits against us in all these
[08:43.720 --> 08:49.280]  rigged jurisdictions who already bankrupted Remington and is now moving against all the
[08:49.280 --> 08:53.240]  other major gun makers and the NRA.
[08:53.240 --> 08:58.760]  So you understand folks, I'm under attack by the very group destroying the NRA, destroying
[08:58.760 --> 09:02.240]  Smith and Weston, destroying Remington, destroying everything.
[09:02.240 --> 09:07.080]  I don't say that like, oh, I'm a victim, I'm the tip of the spear.
[09:07.080 --> 09:08.080]  But you're the tip of the spear.
[09:08.080 --> 09:11.640]  And that's why it's so important that you take this live broadcast feed from your local
[09:11.640 --> 09:17.480]  radio station, TV station, infowars.com, newswars.com, freeworldnews.tv is the link that won't get
[09:17.480 --> 09:23.040]  you censored or banned, freeworldnews.tv for all the videos and live feeds and get it out
[09:23.040 --> 09:27.960]  there because they wouldn't be trying to shut us down if we weren't telling the truth, if
[09:27.960 --> 09:30.240]  we weren't so incredibly effective.
[09:30.240 --> 09:32.880]  So we're the antidote to the New World Order.
[09:32.880 --> 09:40.960]  You taking action and delivering the antidote is how we heal the body politic.
[09:40.960 --> 09:42.320]  So that's coming up.
[09:42.320 --> 09:46.760]  Elon Musk is now coming out more against the New World Order and more against socialism
[09:46.760 --> 09:51.280]  and more against the globalist and more against the Democrats and more against depopulation
[09:51.280 --> 09:54.800]  and also against the globalist AI systems.
[09:54.800 --> 10:01.680]  And he's coming out now and saying just so many things that have got them pulling their
[10:01.680 --> 10:03.920]  hair out like we should have more children.
[10:03.920 --> 10:04.920]  That's coming up.
[10:04.920 --> 10:09.240]  We've got huge inflation news, rising grocery prices at record levels.
[10:09.240 --> 10:13.060]  Peter Sheff on Tucker Carlson, we should get him on next week, discusses the worst
[10:13.060 --> 10:18.080]  inflation in U.S. history because that's really what it is and so much more.
[10:18.080 --> 10:25.280]  But the first thing I want to hit today is the four stacks that I must cover of the most
[10:25.280 --> 10:28.960]  bombshell COVID-19 world government takeover.
[10:28.960 --> 10:34.920]  So one stack is the martial law announcements, the forced inoculation, door-to-door injections
[10:34.920 --> 10:38.760]  in five countries have announced that, which means it's coming here next.
[10:38.760 --> 10:41.600]  It's all around the U.N.
[10:41.600 --> 10:46.080]  The U.N. caught running the migrant waves, mainstream news, invading the U.S. so I've
[10:46.080 --> 10:50.040]  got the whole U.N. global government takeover arm.
[10:50.040 --> 10:54.600]  Then we've got studies by the government of Germany, the U.K. government, the Swedish
[10:54.600 --> 11:00.880]  government and a bunch of others admitting that you're twice as likely as the previous
[11:00.880 --> 11:03.880]  studies said to get COVID to be hospitalized or die.
[11:03.880 --> 11:07.600]  It's the same number, double what all the studies show.
[11:07.600 --> 11:10.840]  New studies, three new studies on that, I've got the stack.
[11:10.840 --> 11:17.080]  Another German study by a pro-vaccine medical group, but now they're saying, well, just
[11:17.080 --> 11:22.640]  make sure nobody has any cancer when you give them the shot because it massively accelerates
[11:22.640 --> 11:26.440]  cancer at levels never before seen.
[11:26.440 --> 11:33.120]  Within weeks, we're talking about cancers metastasizing all over the body and growing
[11:33.120 --> 11:38.280]  at rates like something out of a science fiction movie, like what happened with the
[11:38.280 --> 11:44.120]  first lady they found had a mortal gene line in 1951 when she died when a tumor ate her
[11:44.120 --> 11:45.800]  in a week and a half.
[11:45.800 --> 11:47.920]  Tumor was the size of the head of a pen.
[11:47.920 --> 11:52.720]  When you got discovered it was the size of a quarter, we could have later weighed 40-something
[11:52.720 --> 11:53.920]  pounds and she was gone and ate her.
[11:53.920 --> 11:54.920]  It's like the blob.
[11:54.920 --> 11:55.920]  You grow the blob.
[11:55.920 --> 11:57.160]  It just eats you.
[11:57.160 --> 11:58.160]  That's what happened.
[11:58.160 --> 11:59.160]  We have the CAT scans.
[11:59.160 --> 12:00.160]  We have the MRIs.
[12:00.160 --> 12:04.800]  We have the studies of how you take the Pfizer shot when you've got a tiny cancer and within
[12:04.800 --> 12:10.800]  two weeks, it eats you alive.
[12:10.800 --> 12:15.240]  I mean, this is hardcore.
[12:15.240 --> 12:16.920]  We have got so much to break down.
[12:16.920 --> 12:18.960]  I'm going to air this as well.
[12:18.960 --> 12:23.400]  That's why I've cleared the decks here, so I'm going to play these emergency warnings
[12:23.400 --> 12:29.360]  from Dr. Peter McCullough and from Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of mRNA technology,
[12:29.360 --> 12:35.840]  the full warning is on infowars.com, inventor of mRNA vaccine, warrants, parents, jabs could
[12:35.840 --> 12:41.320]  permanently damage children's critical organs and he shows the studies.
[12:41.320 --> 12:48.080]  Meanwhile, the FDA and CDC back boosters for minors after conducting zero testing on boosters
[12:48.080 --> 12:51.240]  for minors, but the real test show what it does.
[12:51.240 --> 12:53.280]  This is mass murder of our children.
[12:53.280 --> 12:56.160]  That's coming up in the second hour today.
[12:56.160 --> 12:58.920]  Dr. Peter McCullough, Dr. Malone, and so much more.
[12:58.920 --> 13:01.400]  I talked to McCullough this morning.
[13:01.400 --> 13:06.000]  He's going to be in studio sometime, probably next week, if not right after Christmas, doing
[13:06.000 --> 13:07.500]  a huge PowerPoint.
[13:07.500 --> 13:13.360]  I'm going to turn the show over to him for the full three hours, so look for that.
[13:13.360 --> 13:14.360]  He's going to host.
[13:14.360 --> 13:19.240]  In fact, this is such an emergency, I might even go network commercial free and just have
[13:19.240 --> 13:23.960]  the local ads for the local stations because we've got to get this out to our full audience
[13:23.960 --> 13:27.920]  of four to five million people just on the AM and FM stations every day.
[13:27.920 --> 13:29.400]  People have got to have this.
[13:29.400 --> 13:30.400]  They've got to share this.
[13:30.400 --> 13:31.400]  They've got to get this out.
[13:31.400 --> 13:33.000]  We talk about a couple other things here.
[13:33.000 --> 13:37.440]  If you get your orders in by Thursday, anywhere in the United States, you get it well before
[13:37.440 --> 13:40.000]  Christmas by Friday.
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.360]  Almost everywhere you'll get it well before Christmas, but you really need to get your
[13:42.360 --> 13:46.480]  orders in this week and support the broadcast and get great things that wake people up.
[13:46.480 --> 13:48.080]  COVID land two is now out.
[13:48.080 --> 13:50.720]  COVID land, the mask is now out.
[13:50.720 --> 13:55.240]  Part two we produced show powerful and you get a free copy of two films, dark secrets
[13:55.240 --> 13:58.200]  inside Bohemian Grove and the order of death free.
[13:58.200 --> 14:02.840]  So three films for the price of one for a limited time at infowarstore.com, the perfect
[14:02.840 --> 14:07.200]  stocking stuff or the perfect thing to wake up friends and family and to support the broadcast
[14:07.200 --> 14:09.920]  COVID land part two, the mask with two free films.
[14:09.920 --> 14:13.000]  You say, well, I don't want DVDs all the censorship.
[14:13.000 --> 14:16.720]  Everybody's going back to DVDs again and you can make copies and share them with folks.
[14:16.720 --> 14:24.000]  So be sure to take advantage of that and then separately I was literally in the vault over
[14:24.000 --> 14:29.960]  at one of our facilities today and I said, why are there 10 boxes of coins left?
[14:29.960 --> 14:34.960]  I was told we sold out of coins yesterday and they said, well, we held back 500 coins
[14:34.960 --> 14:38.960]  because in case there's any problems or that I said, we're not going to even have 100 coins
[14:38.960 --> 14:42.080]  that have problems getting delivered because you've got to sign for these.
[14:42.080 --> 14:44.000]  And so I made the decision, the crew's great.
[14:44.000 --> 14:45.000]  They're not bad.
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.960]  I was telling you how this happened that no, we're not going to keep 500 coins.
[14:48.960 --> 14:52.360]  We're going to keep 100 coins.
[14:52.360 --> 14:59.160]  So there are 420 something coins as of an hour ago and I checked it available of the 1776
[14:59.160 --> 15:10.320]  coin at 1776coin.com or infowarstore.com but 1776, just the number 1776 coin, 1776coin.com
[15:10.320 --> 15:13.320]  goes directly to the subsection of the infowarstore shopping cart.
[15:13.320 --> 15:15.000]  This is a founder coin.
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.840]  When you leave your email with us, you will get exclusive deals, exclusive content.
[15:18.840 --> 15:23.120]  I got a bunch of stuff coming out early next year and believe me, you'll be glad you did
[15:23.120 --> 15:24.120]  this.
[15:24.120 --> 15:26.200]  It helps us fund and finish that infrastructure.
[15:26.200 --> 15:30.400]  It really is a beautiful historic coin with George Washington slaying the dragon.
[15:30.400 --> 15:35.640]  There's only 400 left of these of the 10,000 and then no more will ever be made.
[15:35.640 --> 15:39.760]  I mean, if we don't have any problems with 100 coins or so with shipment, then sometime
[15:39.760 --> 15:45.880]  in the future I'll sell 100 coins, but there's only 10,000 made, there's 400 left, 1776coin.com.
[15:45.880 --> 15:53.600]  And finally, today is the last day at resetwars.com to get 25% off on this groundbreaking course
[15:53.600 --> 15:55.000]  on how to break your conditioning.
[15:55.000 --> 16:24.760]  So that is resetwars.com available right now.
[16:24.760 --> 16:30.640]  After decades of intense research, our quest to discover the key to breaking the global
[16:30.640 --> 16:33.560]  response is now live.
[16:33.560 --> 16:36.720]  The reset wars have begun.
[16:36.720 --> 16:40.400]  Start your journey at resetwars.com today.
[16:40.400 --> 16:44.600]  Your programming are very subconscious in our psyche to create these false constructs
[16:44.600 --> 16:46.240]  that they then control.
[16:46.240 --> 16:48.840]  We're going to lay out how that works.
[16:48.840 --> 16:53.560]  Your journey against tyranny and true empowerment begins at resetwars.com.
[16:53.560 --> 17:00.560]  Please join me there.
[17:00.560 --> 17:04.200]  Get our great bag of it here.
[17:04.200 --> 17:08.400]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[17:08.400 --> 17:13.640]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[17:13.640 --> 17:16.200]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[17:16.200 --> 17:19.520]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists,
[17:19.520 --> 17:20.960]  but really they're just a commune.
[17:20.960 --> 17:24.000]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.160]  And the farmers don't want the Mexican government to take over.
[17:26.160 --> 17:29.400]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years
[17:29.400 --> 17:30.560]  and the price has never gone up.
[17:30.560 --> 17:34.960]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more for pound.
[17:34.960 --> 17:37.440]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[17:37.440 --> 17:41.720]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally, in fact, I'm
[17:41.720 --> 17:44.080]  not going to tell you a little story.
[17:44.080 --> 17:46.240]  We had like that.
[17:46.240 --> 17:49.320]  I'm not saying you want to believe it.
[17:49.320 --> 17:53.600]  So it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[17:53.600 --> 18:23.440]  And if you don't find us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[18:23.440 --> 18:53.240]  It's the infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[18:53.240 --> 19:00.160]  That's infowarstore.com.
[19:00.160 --> 19:07.080]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class.
[19:07.080 --> 19:12.680]  Not in Communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[19:12.680 --> 19:16.320]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[19:16.320 --> 19:18.040]  That's done by design.
[19:18.040 --> 19:24.080]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[19:24.080 --> 19:29.000]  that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment, the sound of the Bilderberg group, the Trilateral
[19:29.000 --> 19:34.120]  Commission, the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[19:34.120 --> 19:38.360]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the controlled corporate media of the Bilderberg group didn't
[19:38.360 --> 19:39.360]  exist.
[19:39.360 --> 19:44.080]  Well, now the Bilderberg group is public in its former head, still on the steering committee,
[19:44.080 --> 19:50.200]  it's called Schwab and he has set up the Great Reset in global government and as a liberty
[19:50.200 --> 19:54.920]  movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head on about the fact that they are worldwide
[19:54.920 --> 19:55.920]  authoritarian corporate takeover.
[19:55.920 --> 19:56.920]  We don't have a shot.
[19:56.920 --> 20:01.680]  If you expose them, we can beat them easily.
[20:01.680 --> 20:25.680]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:25.680 --> 20:42.320]  I'm Alex Jones, and I've made it my life mission to expose those secrets and empower
[20:42.320 --> 20:43.320]  humanity.
[20:43.320 --> 20:48.120]  And I've made my greatest discovery yet, join me there as humanity goes the next level
[20:48.120 --> 20:58.640]  at ResetWars.com ResetWars is now live at ResetWars.com, see
[20:58.640 --> 21:02.600]  the whole course, Mind Wars, Spirit Wars at 25% off.
[21:02.600 --> 21:07.320]  The deal ends tonight exactly 11.59 PM.
[21:07.320 --> 21:09.800]  And of course, this will also fund our operation.
[21:09.800 --> 21:14.720]  You know, I've only seen George Strait once at the Houston Rodeo and then once when he
[21:14.720 --> 21:18.840]  played a birthday party for somebody that I know, then he just popped in at a honky
[21:18.840 --> 21:22.400]  tonk outside Fredericksburg for 30 minutes and played a few songs.
[21:22.400 --> 21:25.960]  His ace in the hole was there playing.
[21:25.960 --> 21:30.640]  And I want to go see him, you know, before he completely retires.
[21:30.640 --> 21:36.400]  And crappy seats that are up in the upper deck are $1,000.
[21:36.400 --> 21:37.400]  And I did.
[21:37.400 --> 21:42.360]  I bought six tickets to it now because I'm not just splurges on stuff like that.
[21:42.360 --> 21:43.360]  I like George Strait.
[21:43.360 --> 21:45.360]  It's an event.
[21:45.360 --> 21:46.360]  I'm going to do it.
[21:46.360 --> 21:47.360]  I want to see him again.
[21:47.360 --> 21:48.360]  It's coming up pretty soon.
[21:48.360 --> 21:53.240]  And I remember being 18 years old down there with my girlfriend driving down to Houston
[21:53.240 --> 21:56.640]  to see him at the Houston Rodeo where he got famous where he started out.
[21:56.640 --> 22:02.520]  That's $1,000 a ticket, 200 to something bucks for this course that is going to launch a
[22:02.520 --> 22:10.200]  whole system of resistance and actual Prager U type short films, medium films, long films
[22:10.200 --> 22:11.200]  on subjects.
[22:11.200 --> 22:15.320]  And what this is is a very good deal with the massive attacks runner Hillary Clinton
[22:15.320 --> 22:19.000]  sells her stupid course for a similar price.
[22:19.000 --> 22:23.080]  That's a bunch of sycophantic victimhood and new world order garbage.
[22:23.080 --> 22:27.400]  So believe me, this is really powerful information how to take control of your mind, how to break
[22:27.400 --> 22:33.200]  your conditioning, how to separate yourself from the globalist control grid.
[22:33.200 --> 22:43.320]  And it's available at resetwars.com right now until midnight tonight, 25% off.
[22:43.320 --> 22:44.720]  And you see the promo video up there.
[22:44.720 --> 22:45.720]  That's just a promo video.
[22:45.720 --> 22:48.080]  That's not actually the course that you see there on screen.
[22:48.080 --> 22:49.080]  That's just me talking about it.
[22:49.080 --> 22:51.200]  So resetwars.com.
[22:51.200 --> 22:56.520]  And then that will also help keep this entire infrastructure on air with all of the top
[22:56.520 --> 23:01.880]  scientists and researchers and political experts we get on that come on here first
[23:01.880 --> 23:06.200]  and they get the exposure they need to then get on the other big broadcast and I'm not
[23:06.200 --> 23:07.200]  trying to brag.
[23:07.200 --> 23:11.000]  It's just that the enemy knows and they will media matters, talks about it, the Democratic
[23:11.000 --> 23:16.800]  Party talks about it and the globalist UN talk about shutting down Alex Jones' critical
[23:16.800 --> 23:17.800]  to their takeover.
[23:17.800 --> 23:19.320]  So thanks for keeping us on air.
[23:19.320 --> 23:20.320]  We're all in this together.
[23:20.320 --> 23:24.920]  If you want to fight back and don't want to be their slave, both mentally and physically
[23:24.920 --> 23:28.280]  and spiritually, then I'll go to resetwars.com right now and I'll become a member.
[23:28.280 --> 23:34.360]  There's going to be so much more integrated and added into all of that.
[23:34.360 --> 23:40.120]  Okay, here's where I want to start getting in to the globalist takeover.
[23:40.120 --> 23:44.480]  I'm going to show you all the new info that just completely triple confirms everything
[23:44.480 --> 23:49.160]  else we knew but even worse so that we all get a fire load under our ass to make this
[23:49.160 --> 23:53.680]  the front and center issue to save our children and expose how they're now globally, officially
[23:53.680 --> 23:57.880]  coming after them and shooting them up all over the country five and up and now doing
[23:57.880 --> 24:01.120]  trials on newborn babies and covering up the illnesses and deaths.
[24:01.120 --> 24:05.560]  I mean, one of these articles I've got here, I can talk about all day, but when I come
[24:05.560 --> 24:08.400]  back next segment, I'm going to just rapid fire go through them, but I want to start
[24:08.400 --> 24:10.520]  with this.
[24:10.520 --> 24:14.080]  This is the lady Germany needs as their chancellor, not the new monster that replaced Merkel, who's
[24:14.080 --> 24:21.000]  even worse, German, member of European Parliament, Christine Anderson, speech on Big Pharma and
[24:21.000 --> 24:22.000]  tyranny.
[24:22.000 --> 24:27.000]  She's already issued emergency SLSs, this is a global corporate Big Pharma takeover through
[24:27.000 --> 24:28.560]  the medical system.
[24:28.560 --> 24:31.800]  And this is a clarion call about what's happening.
[24:31.800 --> 24:35.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Tucker issues, the similar emergency call.
[24:35.160 --> 24:37.480]  We must all be issuing these emergency calls.
[24:37.480 --> 24:38.960]  Here she is.
[24:38.960 --> 24:43.400]  But please do not consider me a hero.
[24:43.400 --> 24:47.000]  I'm not brave and I'm not courageous.
[24:47.000 --> 24:50.800]  I am simply doing my job.
[24:50.800 --> 24:58.520]  I was elected to parliament to serve the people, to act on their behalf and in their best interest.
[24:58.520 --> 25:06.040]  And I couldn't think of a better way to serve your interest than to uphold freedom, democracy
[25:06.040 --> 25:09.120]  and the rule of law.
[25:09.120 --> 25:16.160]  But I'm telling you, the vast majority of the elected representatives, they are selling
[25:16.160 --> 25:20.040]  you down the river.
[25:20.040 --> 25:27.920]  You know, instead of adjusting our concept of what constitutes fully vaxxed, we need
[25:27.920 --> 25:33.920]  to adjust our concept of what constitutes legitimate government.
[25:33.920 --> 25:41.800]  And governments forcing people into compliance are neither legitimate nor democratic by any
[25:41.800 --> 25:44.880]  stretch of the imagination.
[25:44.880 --> 25:48.560]  And it isn't about your health either.
[25:48.560 --> 25:54.400]  You know, pharmaceutical companies are about as interested in public health as the arms
[25:54.400 --> 25:58.840]  industry is in world peace.
[25:58.840 --> 26:04.120]  Now some of you may argue, I'm exaggerating, I'm misjudging the government's intentions.
[26:04.120 --> 26:07.080]  Granted, that is a possibility.
[26:07.080 --> 26:09.920]  But are you willing to take that risk?
[26:09.920 --> 26:17.400]  Can you afford this nonchalant attitude towards government considering what we all stand to
[26:17.400 --> 26:19.040]  lose?
[26:19.040 --> 26:24.800]  Others may think, yeah, I kind of see where she's coming from, but nah, my government wouldn't
[26:24.800 --> 26:25.800]  do it.
[26:25.800 --> 26:34.120]  Well, not only would they, I'm telling you, they are already doing it as we speak.
[26:34.120 --> 26:41.960]  As Heraclit, a Greek philosopher living in the 5th century BC once said, the truth often
[26:41.960 --> 26:48.120]  evades being recognized due to its utter incredibility.
[26:48.120 --> 26:55.160]  So just because you cannot fathom your government having ill meanings towards you doesn't mean
[26:55.160 --> 26:56.840]  it is not true.
[26:56.840 --> 27:02.680]  So imagine this happened to you in the plane stops and surrounded by military police.
[27:02.680 --> 27:06.280]  Armed men storm the aircraft and drag a man from his seat.
[27:06.280 --> 27:10.480]  So of course you assume at first that terrorism has just been averted.
[27:10.480 --> 27:14.080]  The passenger must have been trying to blow up the plane with a shoe bomb or something.
[27:14.080 --> 27:15.440]  But no, that's not what this is.
[27:15.440 --> 27:16.640]  The man is not a terrorist.
[27:16.640 --> 27:17.920]  He's something worse than that.
[27:17.920 --> 27:20.480]  He violated COVID restrictions.
[27:20.480 --> 27:22.080]  He's a Corona criminal.
[27:22.080 --> 27:23.080]  It's okay you think.
[27:23.080 --> 27:24.080]  You're trying to be reasonable here.
[27:24.080 --> 27:28.160]  A man with COVID should not be on a commercial aircraft spreading the virus to everyone
[27:28.160 --> 27:29.160]  else.
[27:29.160 --> 27:30.280]  And of course that's fair.
[27:30.280 --> 27:33.520]  But here's the thing, this man doesn't have COVID.
[27:33.520 --> 27:37.960]  He was tested right before he got on the airplane and no trace of the virus was found.
[27:37.960 --> 27:41.960]  So why in the world is he being hauled off the flight by armed men?
[27:41.960 --> 27:43.320]  Well here's why.
[27:43.320 --> 27:46.800]  Because the government has determined that based on his travel history, which they have
[27:46.800 --> 27:51.520]  been tracking, he might someday get COVID.
[27:51.520 --> 27:54.960]  Therefore in the name of public health he is being forcibly detained.
[27:54.960 --> 28:00.480]  Not for something he has done, but for something that he potentially might do inadvertently.
[28:00.480 --> 28:05.360]  And for that this man is headed to a COVID camp known euphemistically as a quarantine
[28:05.360 --> 28:06.360]  hotel.
[28:06.360 --> 28:09.920]  If there's a guest in this hotel, he'll be a prisoner.
[28:09.920 --> 28:12.640]  Now all of this just happened in North Korea, you ask?
[28:12.640 --> 28:13.640]  No.
[28:13.640 --> 28:17.480]  In the Netherlands, one of the most quote liberal countries in the world, home of the
[28:17.480 --> 28:20.400]  Hague, the International Court of Justice.
[28:20.400 --> 28:22.640]  This just happened at the Amsterdam airport.
[28:22.640 --> 28:23.720]  You may have been there.
[28:23.720 --> 28:25.480]  Think twice about going back.
[28:25.480 --> 28:29.000]  Okay, and it's the same thing in Australia and the same thing in Canada.
[28:29.000 --> 28:30.480]  It's pre-crime and it gets worse.
[28:30.480 --> 28:36.160]  Tucker, the day before interviewed a senator from Australia who's been critical of the
[28:36.160 --> 28:39.640]  Netherlands, he tested negative inside the country traveling.
[28:39.640 --> 28:42.920]  They came and grabbed him at his house and took him to a camp and said they may not
[28:42.920 --> 28:44.920]  let him out if he complains.
[28:44.920 --> 28:46.920]  Oh, that's the new thing.
[28:46.920 --> 28:49.200]  They're keeping people longer than even the two weeks.
[28:49.200 --> 28:50.200]  It's all fake.
[28:50.200 --> 28:51.200]  It's a cover for martial law.
[28:51.200 --> 28:55.540]  By the time you figure it out, you're locked down inside the Great Reset, build back better.
[28:55.540 --> 28:57.040]  This is the takeover.
[28:57.040 --> 28:59.440]  Hey, everybody.
[28:59.440 --> 29:05.040]  So this could be literally your last chance with all the insane things happening in the

[29:59.600 --> 30:00.920]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[30:00.920 --> 30:02.920]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[30:02.920 --> 30:03.920]  Welcome.
[30:03.920 --> 30:04.920]  Yes, Malcolm.
[30:04.920 --> 30:08.600]  All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the
[30:08.600 --> 30:09.600]  line.
[30:09.600 --> 30:13.840]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, SuperMell
[30:13.840 --> 30:16.440]  Vitality and Brain Force Plus.
[30:16.440 --> 30:19.280]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[30:19.280 --> 30:21.120]  SuperMell Vitality really, really works.
[30:21.120 --> 30:27.320]  It's cold-pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up, and so it has
[30:27.320 --> 30:32.240]  a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't
[30:32.240 --> 30:33.240]  as strong.
[30:33.240 --> 30:34.240]  It's a very fine wine.
[30:34.240 --> 30:37.040]  In fact, each batch is different.
[30:37.040 --> 30:39.080]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[30:39.080 --> 30:42.560]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[30:42.560 --> 30:43.560]  That's just how it is.
[30:43.560 --> 30:45.080]  It's how it works.
[30:45.080 --> 30:46.680]  So it's always good.
[30:46.680 --> 30:50.840]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong, but yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a
[30:50.840 --> 30:59.040]  decent price, then this is it.
[30:59.040 --> 31:03.720]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in M4's live products, and that's why
[31:03.720 --> 31:07.880]  for more than two years we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth, and we could never
[31:07.880 --> 31:13.440]  get the ingredients again until now, and we have reformulated and not just used the same
[31:13.440 --> 31:16.600]  ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[31:16.600 --> 31:20.240]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level.
[31:20.240 --> 31:21.760]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[31:21.760 --> 31:26.800]  Cutting-edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[31:26.800 --> 31:31.720]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder, and
[31:31.720 --> 31:36.320]  a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbo charge your body with antioxidants,
[31:36.320 --> 31:39.880]  and then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium, and sodium
[31:39.880 --> 31:40.880]  added.
[31:40.880 --> 31:42.920]  I mean, this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[31:42.920 --> 31:47.480]  It's got real organic cocoa butter powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of
[31:47.480 --> 31:49.360]  sea salt, and it just goes on and on.
[31:49.360 --> 31:51.200]  It is now back in stock.

[33:01.480 --> 33:14.520]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:14.520 --> 33:25.640]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex
[33:25.640 --> 33:26.640]  Jones.
[33:26.640 --> 33:28.760]  What a time to be alive.
[33:28.760 --> 33:33.800]  They are putting full bore total medical martial law with forced injections in place under
[33:33.800 --> 33:35.300]  UN control.
[33:35.300 --> 33:41.560]  I told you 20 plus months ago that by the winter of 2021 they would start mass arrest
[33:41.560 --> 33:45.360]  around the world, putting people in camps, then they would normalize that worldwide and
[33:45.360 --> 33:46.960]  move that to the United States.
[33:46.960 --> 33:49.160]  That is now beginning.
[33:49.160 --> 33:56.080]  Wednesday live, globalist controlled world leaders announced new lockdowns, forced inoculation
[33:56.080 --> 34:02.280]  plans saying nothing is off the table, says the new German dictator who, again, through
[34:02.280 --> 34:07.800]  parliamentary manipulation was installed, and then the head of the unelected European
[34:07.800 --> 34:13.400]  Union Commission set up in 56 under treaty with the countries they say the forced inoculation
[34:13.400 --> 34:18.800]  start, and so does the new German Chancellor, February 1st.
[34:18.800 --> 34:24.640]  Wednesday live, globalist controlled world leaders announced new lockdowns, forced inoculation
[34:24.640 --> 34:28.120]  plans saying nothing is off the table.
[34:28.120 --> 34:30.800]  So let's do this right now.
[34:30.800 --> 34:35.120]  Let's look at this incredibly life-saving article that must get out to everyone you
[34:35.120 --> 34:36.120]  know.
[34:36.120 --> 34:39.400]  The ticket posted on your own website, I don't care, however you got to get it past
[34:39.400 --> 34:45.040]  the censors, get this video and get this out.
[34:45.040 --> 34:51.240]  Invincer of mRNA vaccine warns parents, jabs could permanently damage children's critical
[34:51.240 --> 34:56.800]  organs because they tried to get this stuff done before it always failed.
[34:56.800 --> 35:00.800]  In a certain percentage of people, you can design mRNA to kill cancer, you name it, but
[35:00.800 --> 35:06.800]  a good percentage of the time it causes leukemia or it causes liver failure, and in the case
[35:06.800 --> 35:12.240]  of spike proteins, all of the above including blood clots.
[35:12.240 --> 35:17.160]  Invincer of mRNA vaccine warns parents, jabs could permanently damage children's critical
[35:17.160 --> 35:19.080]  organs.
[35:19.080 --> 35:25.440]  On the heels of that, FDA's CDC totally controlled by Big Pharma backs boosters for minors after
[35:25.440 --> 35:32.280]  conducting zero testing on boosters and they made the boards resign months ago that weren't
[35:32.280 --> 35:35.680]  even for boosters for old people.
[35:35.680 --> 35:40.160]  And coming up, I'm going to show you the CAT scans and big studies out on what happens
[35:40.160 --> 35:44.200]  to cancer patients after they take the Pfizer shot alone.
[35:44.200 --> 35:48.760]  Moderna is three times stronger, the same damn thing, just three times stronger.
[35:48.760 --> 35:49.760]  Let's continue.
[35:49.760 --> 35:55.160]  FDA, CDC, back boosters for minors after conducting zero testing on boosters for minors.
[35:55.160 --> 36:00.560]  This is the biggest power trip of the eugenicist, depopulationist, Bill Gates, the world has
[36:00.560 --> 36:01.560]  ever seen.
[36:01.560 --> 36:04.640]  I mean, he is just on cloud nine killing everybody right now.
[36:04.640 --> 36:08.080]  Unvaxxed US Google employees set to lose pay and get fired.
[36:08.080 --> 36:11.160]  Isn't that nice working for such a company?
[36:11.160 --> 36:15.440]  Report, FDA colludes with US Postal Service to destroy ivermectin shipments.
[36:15.440 --> 36:20.160]  The FDA has now confirmed the letters real as of yesterday and they say that doctors
[36:20.160 --> 36:25.120]  are not allowed to send you even legal ivermectin, you are going to die.
[36:25.120 --> 36:26.280]  That's the whole plan.
[36:26.280 --> 36:28.040]  Unbelievable criminal government.
[36:28.040 --> 36:33.760]  Flashback, Fauci admits COVID vaccine could actually make people worse with ADE, but they
[36:33.760 --> 36:39.080]  don't want you to know that in Twitter ban, if you try to share his own video.
[36:39.080 --> 36:43.280]  Video third pro football player in a week experiences severe chest pain, has to go to
[36:43.280 --> 36:48.800]  the hospital and one of the top soccer players in the world, Sergio Aguero has announced
[36:48.800 --> 36:54.680]  his retirement from football in age 33 due to heart conditions caused by the Pfizer vaccine
[36:54.680 --> 36:56.560]  heart swelling.
[36:56.560 --> 37:04.040]  Meanwhile, US government under Biden is now saying they're getting ready for new major
[37:04.040 --> 37:09.600]  restrictions and the one in Guardian runs the headline, get used to it.
[37:09.600 --> 37:16.440]  Get used to it working from home, maybe for life, not just Christmas.
[37:16.440 --> 37:19.280]  Isn't that just cute?
[37:19.280 --> 37:22.240]  Isn't that just sweet?
[37:22.240 --> 37:26.840]  Remember the worst part of the 15 days to flatten the curve, you know the worst part
[37:26.840 --> 37:34.200]  of the first 15 days right to flatten the curve is the first two years, we're about
[37:34.200 --> 37:40.400]  to enter year number three, get used to it working from home, maybe for life, not just
[37:40.400 --> 37:45.120]  Christmas as the Guardian, you're non essential now, you're locked up in your house, wear
[37:45.120 --> 37:49.560]  your mask, comply, you'll get out of the crisis, which they now sell never in.
[37:49.560 --> 37:55.840]  Biden on video says, what's the big deal man about vaccine mandate says it's patriotic
[37:55.840 --> 37:57.160]  to take the jab.
[37:57.160 --> 37:59.200]  The third, the fourth, the fifth jab.
[37:59.200 --> 38:03.240]  German Chancellor says there will be no red lines, nothing off the table as regards to
[38:03.240 --> 38:07.080]  COVID restrictions, including forced inoculations and the arrested imprisonment of those that
[38:07.080 --> 38:10.640]  don't take whatever the new shot is, because you know what the unvaxxed and the vaxxed
[38:10.640 --> 38:15.920]  have in common, you're never fully vaxxed.
[38:15.920 --> 38:19.880]  And it gets a lot worse after that, but let me go to Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of
[38:19.880 --> 38:24.720]  mRNAs emergency warning to parents, here it is.
[38:24.720 --> 38:31.680]  I'm a physician and a scientist, but more importantly, I'm a father and a grandfather.
[38:31.680 --> 38:36.400]  I don't usually read from a prepared speech, but this is so important that I wanted to make
[38:36.400 --> 38:43.160]  sure that I got every single word and fact, scientific fact, correct.
[38:43.160 --> 38:48.960]  I stand by this statement with a career dedicated to vaccine research and development.
[38:48.960 --> 38:53.680]  I'm vaccinated for COVID and I'm generally pro vaccination.
[38:53.680 --> 39:00.300]  I've devoted my entire career to developing safe and effective ways to prevent and treat
[39:00.300 --> 39:03.560]  infectious diseases.
[39:03.560 --> 39:07.120]  After this, I'll be posting the text of this statement so that you can share it with your
[39:07.120 --> 39:10.240]  friends and family.
[39:10.240 --> 39:13.560]  Here's the thing.
[39:13.560 --> 39:20.520]  Before you inject your child a decision that is irreversible, I wanted to let you know
[39:20.520 --> 39:26.880]  the scientific facts about this genetic vaccine, which is based on the RNA vaccine technology
[39:26.880 --> 39:30.600]  I created.
[39:30.600 --> 39:37.200]  There are three main issues that parents need to understand before they take this irrevocable
[39:37.200 --> 39:40.680]  decision.
[39:40.680 --> 39:46.600]  The first is that a viral gene will be injected into your parent's cells.
[39:46.600 --> 39:52.720]  This gene forces your child's body to make toxic spike proteins.
[39:52.720 --> 39:58.880]  These proteins often cause permanent damage in children's critical organs.
[39:58.880 --> 40:05.280]  These organs include their brain and nervous system, their heart and blood vessels, including
[40:05.280 --> 40:12.800]  blood clots, their reproductive system, and most importantly, this vaccine can trigger
[40:12.800 --> 40:18.040]  fundamental changes to their immune system.
[40:18.040 --> 40:23.400]  The most alarming point about this is that once these damages have occurred, they are
[40:23.400 --> 40:24.400]  irreparable.
[40:24.400 --> 40:28.040]  They cannot be reversed.
[40:28.040 --> 40:32.520]  You can't fix the lesions within their brains.
[40:32.520 --> 40:38.160]  You cannot prepare heart tissue scarring.
[40:38.160 --> 40:47.640]  You cannot repair a genetically reset immune system, and this vaccine can cause reproductive
[40:47.640 --> 40:55.040]  damage that could affect future generations of your family.
[40:55.040 --> 41:00.760]  The second thing you need to know is about the fact that this novel technology has not
[41:00.760 --> 41:04.480]  been adequately tested.
[41:04.480 --> 41:09.920]  We need at least five years of testing and research before we can really understand the
[41:09.920 --> 41:14.960]  risks associated with this new technology.
[41:14.960 --> 41:25.000]  The harms and risks from new medicines often become revealed many years later.
[41:25.000 --> 41:36.080]  I ask you to ask yourself, as a fellow parent, if you want your child to be part of the most
[41:36.080 --> 41:41.560]  radical experiment in human history.
[41:41.560 --> 41:48.800]  Another final point, the reason they're giving you to vaccinate your child is a lie.
[41:48.800 --> 41:53.720]  Your children represent no danger to their parents or grandparents.
[41:53.720 --> 41:57.960]  It's actually the opposite.
[41:57.960 --> 42:04.400]  Their immunity after getting COVID is critical to save your family, if not the world, from
[42:04.400 --> 42:07.560]  this disease.
[42:07.560 --> 42:18.520]  Finally, in summary, there's no benefit for your children or your family to be vaccinating
[42:18.520 --> 42:22.560]  your children against the small risks of the virus.
[42:22.560 --> 42:29.880]  Given the known health risks of the vaccine that is apparent, you and your children may
[42:29.880 --> 42:35.960]  have to live with for the rest of your lives.
[42:35.960 --> 42:43.160]  The risk benefit analysis is not even close with this vaccine for children.
[42:43.160 --> 42:52.000]  As a parent and grandparent, my strong recommendation to you is to resist and fight to protect your
[42:52.000 --> 43:17.280]  children.
[43:17.280 --> 43:24.360]  It's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure
[43:24.360 --> 43:26.560]  and American jobs.
[43:26.560 --> 43:28.840]  It is the true digital economy.
[43:28.840 --> 43:33.040]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendent control.
[43:33.040 --> 43:39.640]  I've been on there 28 years and all of our work has been amazing thanks to God and God's
[43:39.640 --> 43:41.640]  divine empowerment and blessing.
[43:41.640 --> 43:46.240]  But I got to tell you, out of everything I've done, Reset Wars is the most important and

[44:57.880 --> 45:12.240]  William, in California, people are asleep and programmed controlled.
[45:12.240 --> 45:13.240]  I agree.
[45:13.240 --> 45:14.240]  How do you make the sleeper awaken, William?
[45:14.240 --> 45:15.240]  Hi, Alice.
[45:15.240 --> 45:16.240]  Thanks for taking my call.
[45:16.240 --> 45:17.240]  Can I plug, uh, Alice, real quick?
[45:17.240 --> 45:18.240]  Yeah, go ahead.
[45:18.240 --> 45:24.440]  Hey, I'm in my sixties, uh, and I did the work of twenty-five thirty-year-olds and I
[45:24.440 --> 45:28.200]  worked them into the ground and you wanted a Y and I've tested this and I've taken
[45:28.200 --> 45:32.440]  your B-12 and let me tell you, when I don't take it, I pay a price.
[45:32.440 --> 45:33.440]  I really do.
[45:33.440 --> 45:36.520]  I take that B-12 and I'm electric, man.
[45:36.520 --> 45:37.760]  I can run ten miles.
[45:37.760 --> 45:42.600]  I did some pretty heavy work, uh, with the highway department and my friends will attest
[45:42.600 --> 45:48.400]  to the fact that, yeah, for a guy in his sixties, you know, pushing seventy, I'm, and I'm not
[45:48.400 --> 45:59.400]  just blowing smoke here, the B-12 saves my life.
[45:59.400 --> 46:04.080]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in M4's live products and that's why
[46:04.080 --> 46:08.240]  for more than two years we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth and we could never
[46:08.240 --> 46:13.800]  get the ingredients again until now and we have reformulated and not just used the same
[46:13.800 --> 46:16.960]  ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[46:16.960 --> 46:20.720]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level.
[46:20.720 --> 46:22.120]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[46:22.120 --> 46:27.160]  Cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.

[46:40.080 --> 46:41.080]  added.
[46:41.080 --> 46:43.280]  I mean, this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[46:43.280 --> 46:47.720]  It's got a real organic cocoa butter powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch
[46:47.720 --> 46:49.960]  of sea salt and it just goes on and on.
[46:49.960 --> 46:55.520]  It is now back in stock, Ultimate Bone Broth Plus, available at 20% off and free shipping
[46:55.520 --> 47:00.880]  out of the gates at infowarstore.com.
[47:00.880 --> 47:30.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:30.720 --> 48:00.080]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[48:01.080 --> 48:06.160]  We're going to be white hot forever together with God.
[48:06.160 --> 48:08.000]  That's what the globalists can't stand.
[48:08.000 --> 48:14.800]  All right, here we are, ladies and gentlemen, on this Wednesday, December 15 transmission
[48:14.800 --> 48:21.480]  and coming up in the next hour, I'm going to play amazing excerpts of Dr. Peter McCullough
[48:21.480 --> 48:30.080]  and I'm not tootin' my horn, but I fight the globalists so hard that my biggest pleasures
[48:30.080 --> 48:37.160]  that I want to share with you are helping get amazing and formative people on air and
[48:37.160 --> 48:39.960]  then seeing it explode.
[48:39.960 --> 48:44.760]  And I was instrumental in getting Dr. Peter McCullough on with Joe Rogan and it's now
[48:44.760 --> 48:48.280]  arguably the biggest interview he's ever done, which I was the biggest.
[48:48.280 --> 48:51.760]  You could argue of the interviews, Elon Musk and Alex Jones, the two biggest Joe Rogan
[48:51.760 --> 48:56.040]  interviews, and they could argue in either way which interviews are the biggest, but
[48:56.040 --> 49:01.560]  they're all, they all get 50 to 100 million views depending on which interview it is on
[49:01.560 --> 49:02.560]  all platforms.
[49:02.560 --> 49:09.360]  Those are low numbers, low numbers, 50 to 100 million views, biggest podcast ever, and
[49:09.360 --> 49:12.160]  all of Joe's top podcaster, Elon Musk and Alex Jones.
[49:12.160 --> 49:16.520]  There's some other big ones under that.
[49:16.520 --> 49:20.000]  This is already rivaling those and it'll probably get bigger.
[49:20.000 --> 49:21.000]  I love it.
[49:21.000 --> 49:24.560]  I want my records replaced with somebody saving children.
[49:24.560 --> 49:30.760]  This is awesome, but there's that added deliciousness that it's like a roller ball at the end when
[49:30.760 --> 49:33.360]  he gets the ball after everything he's gone through into the goal.
[49:33.360 --> 49:37.720]  It's like, it's like, you're dying, you're under attack or coming after you, but you
[49:37.720 --> 49:40.200]  just, the worse it gets, the more you score.
[49:40.200 --> 49:43.280]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[49:43.280 --> 49:49.320]  So as bad as all of the globalist takeovers are, and as horrible as the things they do
[49:49.320 --> 49:54.520]  to us and our families and the spiritual warfare and all the rest of it, I'm just
[49:54.520 --> 49:58.680]  so thankful for this audience praying for us and keeping us on air and keeping us in
[49:58.680 --> 50:01.840]  attack formation because without you, we wouldn't be here.
[50:01.840 --> 50:06.440]  And all of the success we've had and all the good work we've done and all the major pushback
[50:06.440 --> 50:08.680]  we're seeing because we really are the resistance.
[50:08.680 --> 50:12.320]  That's all of us together, this family of this broadcast.
[50:12.320 --> 50:17.000]  It's just amazing because if it wasn't for you putting up with this loudmouth Texan,
[50:17.000 --> 50:20.040]  if it wasn't for you and your prayer and your financial support in your word of mouth, we
[50:20.040 --> 50:21.040]  would not be here.
[50:21.040 --> 50:24.720]  So everything you see happening is not this guy.
[50:24.720 --> 50:26.440]  Yes, I'm a focal point.
[50:26.440 --> 50:27.440]  I'm willing to do it.
[50:27.440 --> 50:28.440]  I don't back down.
[50:28.440 --> 50:29.440]  I can't stop.
[50:29.440 --> 50:30.440]  I get threatened.
[50:30.440 --> 50:31.800]  It makes me get more aggressive.
[50:31.800 --> 50:35.800]  God chose me for this mission right at the tip of the spear because God knows who I am.
[50:35.800 --> 50:37.040]  God formed me.
[50:37.040 --> 50:38.040]  God built me for this.
[50:38.040 --> 50:39.040]  Now I can see it more than ever.
[50:39.040 --> 50:40.040]  It's unbelievable.
[50:40.040 --> 50:43.240]  But it is our communion.
[50:43.240 --> 50:44.880]  It is our Congress.
[50:44.880 --> 50:48.000]  It is our coming together that did this.
[50:48.000 --> 50:54.600]  I salute you and I thank you and I appreciate you because it's horrible as a lot of things
[50:54.600 --> 50:55.600]  are.
[50:55.600 --> 50:59.240]  At least we're in the thick of battle together and having major victory every time a good
[50:59.240 --> 51:00.600]  person stands up.
[51:00.600 --> 51:02.400]  What did Thomas Jefferson say?
[51:02.400 --> 51:04.920]  They said, how do we defeat evil?
[51:04.920 --> 51:06.440]  How do we defeat corruption?
[51:06.440 --> 51:07.640]  How do we defeat the king of England?
[51:07.640 --> 51:10.640]  And he wrote letters and gave speeches and said it made different ways.
[51:10.640 --> 51:17.200]  But the famous quote is, all that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good
[51:17.200 --> 51:18.840]  men do nothing.
[51:18.840 --> 51:24.000]  Well, I believed that 30 years ago when I started trying to get on air and I got on
[51:24.000 --> 51:27.320]  air 28 years ago now.
[51:27.320 --> 51:29.160]  And I've seen nothing but victory.
[51:29.160 --> 51:30.960]  I mean, there's been defeats on the way.
[51:30.960 --> 51:35.680]  I lost a lot of battles, but every damn war I went in the end.
[51:35.680 --> 51:39.400]  No matter how bad it looks, no matter how much it looks like I'm going down, no matter
[51:39.400 --> 51:43.960]  how bloody I am, no matter how horrible it is, I've learned because I used to, I didn't
[51:43.960 --> 51:45.760]  know I just couldn't help myself if it didn't back down.
[51:45.760 --> 51:47.600]  I thought, hell, I'm losing, but I'm going to keep fighting.
[51:47.600 --> 51:54.080]  And then I kept noticing when I never, when I don't give up, I just get stronger and crazier
[51:54.080 --> 52:04.080]  and crazier stuff ends up happening and it just gets more and more amazing.
[52:04.080 --> 52:06.080]  What's unfolding?
[52:06.080 --> 52:08.760]  And that's where we are right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[52:08.760 --> 52:11.480]  So we have to stand up.
[52:11.480 --> 52:12.840]  We have to beat these people.
[52:12.840 --> 52:15.840]  They are coming after our children.
[52:15.840 --> 52:18.000]  In fact, they're not coming after them.
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.880]  I say that because I want to take away some of my guilt.
[52:20.880 --> 52:23.280]  They're already killing them right now en masse with these damn shots.
[52:23.280 --> 52:25.880]  I mean, they are exterminating children.
[52:25.880 --> 52:29.080]  Hear about Joseph Mengele killing little kids in the death camps.
[52:29.080 --> 52:32.880]  Well, this is going on right now for sure.
[52:32.880 --> 52:33.880]  And we know so.
[52:33.880 --> 52:39.480]  You just heard Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of mRNA telling you that.
[52:39.480 --> 52:41.560]  And I'll just leave it at this.
[52:41.560 --> 52:43.800]  In the scenes, all these scientists say it's deliberate.
[52:43.800 --> 52:44.800]  It's a world government takeover.
[52:44.800 --> 52:45.800]  It's the Great Reset.
[52:45.800 --> 52:46.800]  It's a depopulation.
[52:46.800 --> 52:48.720]  The ADEs are going to start killing people en masse.
[52:48.720 --> 52:50.080]  They're going to say it's a new variant.
[52:50.080 --> 52:55.840]  Alex, you've got to tell them because they're not willing to go all the way.
[52:55.840 --> 52:58.680]  Everybody knows I'm ready because I've already, that's my lot in life.
[52:58.680 --> 52:59.920]  I'm not like, oh, I'm a hero.
[52:59.920 --> 53:01.560]  I'm on the suicide mission.
[53:01.560 --> 53:05.760]  Everybody understands that I'm, this is the real suicide squad, not some Marvel comic
[53:05.760 --> 53:06.760]  show folks.
[53:06.760 --> 53:07.760]  This is the suicide squad.
[53:07.760 --> 53:09.360]  And it doesn't mean I want to die.
[53:09.360 --> 53:13.800]  A suicide mission is a mission you're being sent on where you've got at least a 50% chance
[53:13.800 --> 53:15.520]  of not coming out of it.
[53:15.520 --> 53:19.880]  Well, there is nowhere I'd want to be but on the suicide squad.
[53:19.880 --> 53:20.880]  That's where you're alive.
[53:20.880 --> 53:25.800]  Both my grandfathers, the Army Air Corps and the World War II, they were in the suicide
[53:25.800 --> 53:27.680]  squad too, but they barely lived.
[53:27.680 --> 53:28.680]  So I could be here.
[53:28.680 --> 53:29.920]  I think God was probably at a hand in that.
[53:29.920 --> 53:33.400]  But the point is, is that you better get in the suicide squad too, ladies and gentlemen.
[53:33.400 --> 53:36.120]  And that doesn't mean you got to go kill people or any of that.
[53:36.120 --> 53:37.120]  No, we don't want that.
[53:37.120 --> 53:41.120]  You got to just stand up and speak out and say no at your church and on the local radio
[53:41.120 --> 53:45.720]  show and on access TV and in Congress and the legislature and everywhere and praying
[53:45.720 --> 53:49.720]  and supporting and everything you can do.
[53:49.720 --> 53:55.520]  Because it's all coming down to brass tacks right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[53:55.520 --> 54:00.920]  I mean, they started putting signs on buses and billboards in Europe, the UK and the US
[54:00.920 --> 54:06.120]  and Canada six months ago before they approved it in five-year-olds and up saying kids have
[54:06.120 --> 54:07.880]  strokes and heart attacks too.
[54:07.880 --> 54:12.800]  What the hell do you think's going on here?
[54:12.800 --> 54:17.400]  So my drive and desire is to stay on air.
[54:17.400 --> 54:20.360]  My drive and desire is to stay in this fight as long as possible.
[54:20.360 --> 54:23.480]  And God's going to work through you to decide if we do that or not.
[54:23.480 --> 54:25.080]  But I'm telling you, I need your funds.
[54:25.080 --> 54:26.080]  I need your prayers.
[54:26.080 --> 54:27.480]  I need your word of mouth.
[54:27.480 --> 54:28.480]  Just like you need it as well.
[54:28.480 --> 54:29.480]  It's symbiotic.
[54:29.480 --> 54:33.120]  So go to infowarstore.com, do your Christmas shopping there.
[54:33.120 --> 54:34.120]  It's still plenty of time.
[54:34.120 --> 54:35.640]  Get your orders in and get it by Christmas.
[54:35.640 --> 54:47.000]  We've got shortwave radios that are $16 that work amazingly that we make $7 on.
[54:47.000 --> 54:48.640]  Look at that little video on there.
[54:48.640 --> 54:55.000]  We have a digital one that is the equivalent of $1,000 shortwave radio 20 years ago because
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.520]  of miniaturization for 100-something bucks.
[54:57.520 --> 55:01.680]  But that little silver one you see is $16.
[55:01.680 --> 55:03.520]  It was $100 a couple of years ago.
[55:03.520 --> 55:04.520]  But everything's miniaturized.
[55:04.520 --> 55:05.880]  Everything's getting cheaper.
[55:05.880 --> 55:11.480]  We've got those at infowarstore.com, AM, FM, shortwave, emergency radios for as low as
[55:11.480 --> 55:13.680]  $16 and they work great.
[55:13.680 --> 55:19.160]  We've also got a couple hundred of the coins left because they held back more than I had
[55:19.160 --> 55:20.160]  told them to.
[55:20.160 --> 55:21.160]  The crew's great.
[55:21.160 --> 55:22.160]  I love them.
[55:22.160 --> 55:23.160]  They just held back 500 coins instead of 100.
[55:23.160 --> 55:25.160]  We don't need to hold back more than 100.
[55:25.160 --> 55:26.920]  We won't have that much problem with shipping.
[55:26.920 --> 55:28.960]  Everybody's almost basically had them coin shipped out.
[55:28.960 --> 55:30.800]  They're sold out.
[55:30.800 --> 55:32.760]  But now we learned we had an extra 400.
[55:32.760 --> 55:37.760]  So those will sell out very soon, 1776coin.com, your last chance to get this historic coin
[55:37.760 --> 55:41.800]  1776coin.com or infowarstore.com.
[55:41.800 --> 55:45.560]  And again, it has a big markup on it because it's funding the next level of revolution.
[55:45.560 --> 55:47.400]  It's a war bond.
[55:47.400 --> 55:51.680]  You spend thousands of bucks on NFL tickets, thousands of bucks on rock and roll and country
[55:51.680 --> 55:52.680]  tickets and I get it.
[55:52.680 --> 55:53.680]  I'm not blaming you.
[55:53.680 --> 55:58.880]  But hell, you could spend 130 bucks, 129 bucks to buy a historic coin that says founder on
[55:58.880 --> 56:02.480]  it that's funding us staying on the air and launching a bunch of new operations.
[56:02.480 --> 56:03.480]  Visit infowarstore.com.
[56:03.480 --> 56:13.360]  Okay, I didn't get to Dr. McCullough, but we'll come back next hour and get to it.
[56:13.360 --> 56:14.800]  This is a powerful interview.
[56:14.800 --> 56:19.040]  I've got nine excerpts I'm going to be airing here that you need to get.
[56:19.040 --> 56:20.040]  You need to look into.
[56:20.040 --> 56:23.520]  You need to share because this guy is a prestigious heart surgeon and research scientist that's
[56:23.520 --> 56:29.640]  run FDA major programs and they are scrapping their breaches that he's awake and they're
[56:29.640 --> 56:34.120]  crapping their breaches that he's there and they have come after him and everything else
[56:34.120 --> 56:36.520]  he doesn't want to talk about it on air because I get it.
[56:36.520 --> 56:38.520]  It's not that he's embarrassed or even scared.
[56:38.520 --> 56:40.160]  He doesn't want that distraction.
[56:40.160 --> 56:43.120]  But I love the fact that more they mess with him.
[56:43.120 --> 56:45.600]  God, he was telling me all the stuff behind the scenes they've done to him.
[56:45.600 --> 56:46.600]  That just pissed him off.
[56:46.600 --> 56:47.600]  Tom's worse.
[56:47.600 --> 56:51.040]  Same thing with us, man.
[56:51.040 --> 56:52.240]  We're not backing down.
[56:52.240 --> 56:54.760]  You people want to fight.
[56:54.760 --> 56:58.080]  You better believe you got one and it's an information war and it's a spirit war and
[56:58.080 --> 56:59.600]  it's a financial war.
[56:59.600 --> 57:03.920]  So support our local AM and FM stations tied to those stations that have this show and
[57:03.920 --> 57:05.960]  other shows on like them.
[57:05.960 --> 57:07.160]  We're fighting for pro-life.
[57:07.160 --> 57:08.320]  We're fighting for Christ.
[57:08.320 --> 57:14.240]  We're actually saving souls thanks to God's divine intervention.
[57:14.240 --> 57:18.200]  But these stations need your support.
[57:18.200 --> 57:19.720]  They're doing way more than your local church.
[57:19.720 --> 57:22.800]  I'm sorry unless you've got a rare church that's actually doing their job.
[57:22.800 --> 57:27.040]  These radio stations are literally basically all we've got left.
[57:27.040 --> 57:28.680]  You better support them as well.
[57:28.680 --> 57:30.160]  Give them a donation.
[57:30.160 --> 57:31.160]  It's so important.
[57:31.160 --> 57:32.160]  All right.
[57:32.160 --> 57:37.200]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with our number two, with Dr. Peter McCullough
[57:37.200 --> 57:41.480]  and the Joe Rogan megabomb shell interview that's going to be his biggest ever and so
[57:41.480 --> 57:42.480]  much more.
[57:42.480 --> 57:43.480]  Hallelujah.
[57:43.480 --> 57:59.520]  So this could be literally your last chance with all the insane things happening in the
[57:59.520 --> 58:17.880]  world.

[59:35.640 --> 59:39.640]  it on my car. I've given it to my parents as gifts way out the middle of nowhere where regular
[59:39.640 --> 59:47.560]  phones don't work. They work. InfoWorstStore.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and ask the Alex Jones
[59:47.560 --> 59:57.240]  Special. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:00.840 --> 1:00:05.800]  So with nice people, which it still is, it's almost beyond conception what is happening there
[1:00:05.800 --> 1:00:09.960]  right now. For example, an Australian woman called Haley Hodgson just spent two weeks in a
[1:00:09.960 --> 1:00:15.240]  coronavirus internment camp in Howard Spring, Australia. Oh, there are no internment camps
[1:00:15.240 --> 1:00:21.000]  in Australia. Yes, there are. Listen to her describe her experience. You feel like you're
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:25.800]  in prison. You feel like you've done something wrong. It's inhumane what they're doing. Like,
[1:00:25.800 --> 1:00:32.440]  you are so small. They just overpower you and you're literally nothing. So because I was so
[1:00:32.440 --> 1:00:37.640]  distressed and I said, can you just please let me out for a walk or a run? Like, I'm in this little
[1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:43.560]  box and I move. Can I please, you know, I'm anxious. I'm feeling not well. Just I need to get out.
[1:00:43.560 --> 1:00:48.600]  And they literally said, we've got a doctor calling you and we'll get some valium prescribed to you
[1:00:48.600 --> 1:00:53.240]  that you can call us anytime you like and you can have valium. Yeah, here's some soma just
[1:00:53.240 --> 1:00:59.320]  medicated away. So this is happening to a lot of people in Australia and not just the powerless
[1:00:59.320 --> 1:01:04.840]  and Australian senator who has been critical of COVID restrictions was recently forced into a
[1:01:04.840 --> 1:01:11.240]  quarantine camp despite testing negative for COVID repeatedly. And now the government of Australia
[1:01:11.240 --> 1:01:17.640]  which he has criticized just sent him a $4,000 bill while he's in detention. Hard to believe it's
[1:01:17.640 --> 1:01:22.120]  real, but it is that Senator Alex Antic joins us now. Mr. Antic, thanks so much for coming on.
[1:01:24.120 --> 1:01:29.240]  Again, everything about this is impossible to believe given the very warm and positive
[1:01:29.240 --> 1:01:33.400]  feelings most Americans, including me, have for your country. Are we overstating any of this?
[1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:38.360]  Well, the only thing that's not right about that so far, Tucker, is that I haven't got the bill yet.
[1:01:38.360 --> 1:01:42.440]  I'm led to believe I will have. That's written into law here. But that's really a sideline issue
[1:01:42.440 --> 1:01:47.880]  here. No, look, you're not. I have been concerned about some of the powers that have been gifted
[1:01:47.880 --> 1:01:52.680]  to the unelected bureaucracy in this country for a long period of time. I've spoken about them
[1:01:52.680 --> 1:01:57.800]  quite fully. And in fact, I've been seeking documentation very recently from local health
[1:01:57.800 --> 1:02:05.160]  bureaucrats, which were effectively upscaled up to a higher body a week before I was told that
[1:02:05.160 --> 1:02:10.440]  upon my return from my job in Canberra, which you'll know is effectively our Washington,
[1:02:11.080 --> 1:02:15.480]  I would be asked to come into, well, told, I should say, to come into a medi hotel,
[1:02:15.480 --> 1:02:21.160]  which in Australian parlance is a hotel which has been turned into a detainment facility.
[1:02:21.720 --> 1:02:25.880]  And so, you know, that was completely out of step with other people's experiences,
[1:02:25.880 --> 1:02:29.480]  completely out of step with what had been done in my previous trips to Canberra back.
[1:02:30.040 --> 1:02:34.120]  But here's the kicker, and here's the thing that gives away what was going on here,
[1:02:34.120 --> 1:02:38.600]  Tucker, is that 10 minutes after I found that information out, I got a call from a journalist
[1:02:38.600 --> 1:02:43.080]  who also knew about it, who also knew all the details. And when I arrived at the airport,
[1:02:43.080 --> 1:02:47.000]  there was a camera crew and a photographer and a journalist all there to capture it.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:51.800]  Tucker, the message is real. If people want to speak out and they can do this to me,
[1:02:51.800 --> 1:02:55.160]  they can do it to anyone, I've never been more concerned about the things that are going on
[1:02:55.160 --> 1:03:00.120]  in this country. Well, it's just absolutely beyond belief. I mean, if you're forcing someone who,
[1:03:00.120 --> 1:03:03.960]  you don't have COVID, and you've been tested multiple times, as I understand, right? If you
[1:03:03.960 --> 1:03:11.400]  can force an opposition politician into an internment camp for no real reason, then, I mean,
[1:03:11.400 --> 1:03:16.440]  I, you know, I don't want to attack Australia, which again, everyone in America loves, but
[1:03:16.440 --> 1:03:22.040]  that's not the way we understand democracy at all, at all. No, and just to correct that,
[1:03:22.040 --> 1:03:25.480]  I'm actually a member of the government, both the state and the federal government.
[1:03:26.280 --> 1:03:29.560]  I meant to say someone who has criticized the policies, which obviously you have.
[1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:32.920]  You're quite right. Yeah, you're quite right. I have. Look, and the issue is this, Tucker,
[1:03:32.920 --> 1:03:39.000]  and this is the lesson for the United States. Parliaments all over the country in Australia
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:44.760]  have gifted unrivaled powers to their bureaucrats. And they did so on the basis that we were told
[1:03:44.760 --> 1:03:48.280]  there was two weeks to flatten the curve. They never did so on the basis that there were going
[1:03:48.280 --> 1:03:54.360]  to be two years to keep people locked down and mandate vaccinations. The bureaucrats everywhere
[1:03:54.360 --> 1:03:58.120]  across the world, but certainly in Australia, it's true. They never like to get out of the warm
[1:03:58.120 --> 1:04:03.720]  bed of power and coercive control. They won't do it here. And I tell you, they are holding on to
[1:04:03.720 --> 1:04:09.480]  dear life. It is here, across the country, you would have seen the pictures, your viewers would
[1:04:09.480 --> 1:04:13.320]  have seen the pictures coming out of Victoria, where the police there have been using strike
[1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:18.680]  breaking tactics against children, against old women, against the populace generally. And the
[1:04:18.680 --> 1:04:24.120]  parliament over there has just gifted powers to the Premier, which are unrivaled. He can effectively
[1:04:24.120 --> 1:04:28.040]  do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and for however long he wants in relation to pandemic
[1:04:28.040 --> 1:04:32.520]  response, which includes similar things that you saw with that first young lady up in the
[1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:37.080]  Northern Territory, who was basically taken from her house because security footage showed her
[1:04:37.080 --> 1:04:41.160]  walking the streets with someone who ultimately tested positive to COVID. This is madness.
[1:04:41.160 --> 1:04:45.000]  It is literally madness. And I'm not even sure if you're aware of this,
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:48.840]  but so many people are denying this is happening or making excuses for it that we're just
[1:04:49.480 --> 1:04:53.720]  very grateful, Alex Antic, that you are here with us tonight. South Australia Senator Alex
[1:04:53.720 --> 1:04:59.640]  Antic, God bless you. We'll be right back. Stay with us. Thank you. Everything I do.
[1:05:00.280 --> 1:05:05.240]  We have developed the research and the tools to stop this evil and to break free from it and
[1:05:05.240 --> 1:05:10.360]  then to help others break free from it. That's why we've launched reset wars. Once you simply
[1:05:10.360 --> 1:05:14.680]  accept that there is an incredibly evil group of people in the world that are attempting the great
[1:05:14.680 --> 1:05:20.680]  reset and want a one world corporate government, then you can learn how to defeat them by learning
[1:05:20.680 --> 1:05:27.000]  their war game strategies and how to not play the game. After decades of intense research,
[1:05:28.200 --> 1:05:35.400]  our quest to discover the key to breaking the globalist bonds is now live. The reset wars
[1:05:35.400 --> 1:05:42.520]  have begun. Start your journey at resetwars.com today. Your programming are very subconscious
[1:05:42.520 --> 1:05:48.280]  on our psyche to create these false constructs that they then control. We're going to lay out
[1:05:48.280 --> 1:05:53.720]  how that works. Your journey against tyranny and true empowerment begins at resetwars.com.
[1:05:53.720 --> 1:05:54.680]  Please join me there.
[1:05:54.680 --> 1:06:11.000]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government coverups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:25.640]  Live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[1:06:25.640 --> 1:06:31.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. Our number two broadcasting worldwide from our
[1:06:31.720 --> 1:06:36.840]  rebel fortress in central Texas, formerly Austin now captured by the Californians,
[1:06:36.840 --> 1:06:41.560]  who aren't really Californians. They've been able to capture California and have now marched
[1:06:41.560 --> 1:06:47.960]  into our state to take it over for their lord and savior, George Soros and his daddy Satan.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:53.640]  Well, here we are, ladies and gentlemen, and there's so much to cover. There's so much to
[1:06:53.640 --> 1:07:01.080]  go over today. There's so much to break down. But I want to open the phones up today. I had a great
[1:07:01.080 --> 1:07:07.480]  guest book today, but that guess is not going to be here. So we can take your phone calls starting
[1:07:07.480 --> 1:07:14.440]  at about 45 after this hour throughout the third hour, your take your view on the martial law on
[1:07:14.440 --> 1:07:21.800]  the COVID dictatorships on Joe Biden on 328 days out from the midterms and what you see
[1:07:22.680 --> 1:07:28.440]  them up to and what you think they're going to pull. So at the bottom of the hour, I will give
[1:07:28.440 --> 1:07:36.120]  the number out. Everybody knows I like to talk. But today you've been hearing and seeing me play
[1:07:36.120 --> 1:07:42.840]  a lot of clips because so many big heavyweights in science and the medical system are coming right
[1:07:42.840 --> 1:07:46.680]  out and saying, okay, it's all staged. It's depopulation. It's world government. It's on purpose.
[1:07:46.680 --> 1:07:52.680]  They want you to die. They want to normalize killing you. This is a psychological warfare operation.
[1:07:52.680 --> 1:07:58.760]  So let me hit these headlines and then I'm going to get to excerpts of Dr. Peter McCullough
[1:07:58.760 --> 1:08:04.200]  on the super viral interview with Joe Rogan that was taped last week. Joe thought whatever the
[1:08:04.200 --> 1:08:08.760]  next day, but for some reason it waited a while and just went out a few days ago. So
[1:08:09.880 --> 1:08:15.480]  inventor of mRNA vaccines warrants parents. Jabs could permanently damage children's critical
[1:08:15.480 --> 1:08:23.640]  organs. FDA CDC back boosters for minors after conducting zero testing on boosters for minors
[1:08:23.640 --> 1:08:30.120]  when their own board said don't do it. Unvaxxed US Google employees set to lose pay and get fired.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:37.400]  Report. Now confirmed by the FDA. FDA colludes with US Postal Service not to stop fentanyl.
[1:08:37.400 --> 1:08:43.640]  That's fine. But to stop totally legal, totally lawful and totally healthy ivermectin shipments
[1:08:43.640 --> 1:08:49.320]  from doctors to their patients. Fauci admits that COVID vaccine could actually make people
[1:08:49.320 --> 1:08:55.320]  sick with ADE a year ago. Now it's happening. Third pro football player in a week experiences
[1:08:55.320 --> 1:09:01.400]  severe chest pain during game. Breaking Sergio Aguero, one of the top stars in the world,
[1:09:01.400 --> 1:09:06.200]  has announced his retirement after the Pfizer shot from mycocarditis. It won't go away.
[1:09:07.400 --> 1:09:11.800]  The London Guardian says get used to it. Working from home may be for life,
[1:09:11.800 --> 1:09:17.000]  not just Christmas. Oh, again, the worst part about the first 15 days.
[1:09:18.440 --> 1:09:22.840]  The 15 days to flatten the curve is the first two years. Now we're in the third year.
[1:09:23.480 --> 1:09:28.360]  So that joke meme I put out almost two years ago is now not a joke anymore. It was a prediction.
[1:09:29.240 --> 1:09:34.280]  Video Biden asked what's the big deal about vaccine mandates says it's patriotic to take the
[1:09:34.280 --> 1:09:41.000]  COVID jabs. Video German Chancellor says there will be no red lines as regards to COVID restrictions.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:46.520]  He says forced inoculations start in February. And they're going to start imprisoning those
[1:09:46.520 --> 1:09:51.080]  that don't take the shots. That's all you in run total world government. Now I want to show you
[1:09:51.080 --> 1:09:56.200]  some of these graphs and statistics that are from governments. They're not even denying this.
[1:09:56.200 --> 1:10:00.760]  They're just bearing it. Kind of like the FDA tried to block the release of their own FDA documents
[1:10:01.640 --> 1:10:05.640]  from Pfizer. And the judge said, well, just release the first few documents.
[1:10:05.640 --> 1:10:11.800]  Thousands of deaths, miscarriages, cover ups. I mean, just incredible. So Germans are funny,
[1:10:11.800 --> 1:10:17.160]  says Lilith of Assyria on Twitter. You can click through the German government COVID-19
[1:10:17.160 --> 1:10:26.440]  proportional vaccine adoption and connected to death and illnesses and all the rest of it.
[1:10:26.440 --> 1:10:32.280]  And you see it's incredible. You start the first shot and it follows the exact amount of people
[1:10:32.280 --> 1:10:39.000]  sick. Start the second shot, third shot, even worse, ladies and gentlemen. Exclusive, Dan
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:47.960]  Andrews is ordered to front court for concealing treason and fraud and extraordinary win by anti
[1:10:47.960 --> 1:10:55.480]  lockdown commissioners in Australia who convinced a Bush court to accept a private prosecution.
[1:10:55.480 --> 1:10:59.720]  Long story short, they've all gotten money from Pfizer and Moderna to set up martial law
[1:10:59.720 --> 1:11:04.280]  to the force inoculations. He's gotten caught in that and now it's gone to court. That's the
[1:11:04.280 --> 1:11:09.480]  Daily Mail that is reporting on that. Here's the actual article. Dan Andrews goes on leave after
[1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:18.280]  being ordered to front court for concealing treason and fraud. Here's another article out of the
[1:11:18.280 --> 1:11:23.960]  Telegraph of Australia. The Omnicron epidemic is being driven by young vaccinated people
[1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:29.320]  according to monitoring data from countries as diverse as UK Denmark and South Africa. Funny,
[1:11:29.320 --> 1:11:36.840]  it's people that have had the shot that are now sick. Oh my gosh. Who could have predicted it?
[1:11:36.840 --> 1:11:44.920]  Expert reveals who is spreading Omnicron variant of the COVID-19 news.com.au. There it is for you.
[1:11:46.920 --> 1:11:52.440]  Deaths now to increase in New York City as well. As the vaccines go up, the death rates increase.
[1:11:52.440 --> 1:11:59.880]  Here's another one. Cases growing exponentially rapidly in New York City more than doubled
[1:11:59.880 --> 1:12:07.080]  the last two weeks as the booster shots begin. Isn't that interesting? You see that same graph.
[1:12:07.080 --> 1:12:11.560]  We've shown that graph from a few months ago over and over again. 90-country graph where it shows
[1:12:11.560 --> 1:12:15.800]  right when the shots start, right when the injections begin, right here at the bottom.
[1:12:15.800 --> 1:12:24.680]  Well, then it just goes right back up. Absolutely incredible. Here's another one. Two weeks ago,
[1:12:24.680 --> 1:12:32.040]  the UK reinstated mass mandates in many settings despite them already failing to prevent multiple
[1:12:32.040 --> 1:12:38.040]  surges. Somehow despite doing what we know works, close quote, cases are still rising and rapidly
[1:12:38.040 --> 1:12:45.080]  approaching a new high. Funny, every time you take a shot, that's when it increases. Take a shot.
[1:12:46.040 --> 1:12:52.680]  Take a shot. Take a shot. Look at that. That's what the shots do for you.
[1:12:53.800 --> 1:12:57.800]  It's like, you're not a pathologist. How do you know if you shoot somebody in the head
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:03.560]  with a double-oct buck shot at point blank range and blow their brains all over the wall?
[1:13:03.560 --> 1:13:07.960]  How do you know that person's dead? Well, I'm not a doctor, but the blood stop pumping out of the
[1:13:07.960 --> 1:13:12.840]  arteries and veins, and I can take their pulse. There's no pulse. Well, you're not a doctor.
[1:13:12.840 --> 1:13:17.160]  I mean, how do you know? Well, every time they give the shots here, the cases of illnesses,
[1:13:17.160 --> 1:13:21.400]  hospitalizations, and death skyrocket. I mean, hell, ain't got to be a rocket science figure
[1:13:21.400 --> 1:13:27.240]  that out. You're like, you're not a pathologist. Well, if I walk over and start hacking, hypothetically,
[1:13:27.240 --> 1:13:33.560]  wouldn't do this, the camera operator, the boom operator with a hatchet and blood spraying out,
[1:13:33.560 --> 1:13:38.440]  and I cut his head off on TV and hold it up, and like, how do we know he's dead? Well, his head's
[1:13:38.440 --> 1:13:42.520]  cut off. Well, you're not a scientist. Hell, even if you're a scientist, you say that you can't.
[1:13:42.520 --> 1:13:48.840]  Only the UN can make scientific studies. But it gets better. Flight attendants blame airport
[1:13:48.840 --> 1:13:53.960]  drinking for stoking mask anger. That's right. People aren't just mad at the mask and they
[1:13:53.960 --> 1:14:01.480]  have the control, uh, stewardesses. They are completely pissed off and upset because of drinking.
[1:14:01.480 --> 1:14:05.640]  Yes, and now a lot of airlines and health governments are banning alcohol in Europe.
[1:14:05.640 --> 1:14:09.800]  Now the new lockdowns. Oh, you won't take the shot when you can't have your alcohol now.
[1:14:10.680 --> 1:14:14.680]  They really want you to take that shot because they care about you, even though all the different
[1:14:14.680 --> 1:14:18.280]  globalists say they want to depopulate you. Yes, I want to kill you, but please take this. I want
[1:14:18.280 --> 1:14:26.760]  you to live. Continuing vaccine prevents severe disease, they say, but all over the world in
[1:14:26.760 --> 1:14:33.000]  the most vaccinated states, 85% of adults vaccinated in the USA are seeing record COVID
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:39.640]  hospitalizations currently way higher than last year. Wow. So does the vaccine work? Yeah,
[1:14:39.640 --> 1:14:45.160]  it makes you sick and kills you. It works damn well. Just not the way they said it did.
[1:14:46.840 --> 1:14:53.640]  And it goes on and on and on and on. But Biden suggests his build back better legislation
[1:14:53.640 --> 1:14:58.040]  would have prevented deadly tornadoes. I'll get to that later. I propose a way to deal with it.
[1:14:58.040 --> 1:15:04.280]  Taxes and money to them. Oh, but don't worry. It gets better in the UK, in Australia, in everywhere.
[1:15:05.240 --> 1:15:10.120]  COVID passports not expected to apply to members of parliament in the commons and
[1:15:10.120 --> 1:15:16.040]  speaker announces. Oh, the government officials and the media people, they're all exempt. Wow.
[1:15:16.840 --> 1:15:20.840]  Ruling elite using this to control you. They're exempt. Imagine my shock
[1:15:20.840 --> 1:15:23.960]  to quote Paul Joseph Watson, but we're going to go to break.
[1:15:25.240 --> 1:15:29.000]  And we're going to come back with Dr. Peter McCullough and Joe Rogan. And we've gone in
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:34.440]  very judiciously, very smartly in a three hour interview and cut it down to about 14 minutes.
[1:15:35.400 --> 1:15:40.360]  The most juicy important parts straight ahead. And then your phone calls toll free number to

[1:16:03.320 --> 1:16:08.920]  because it could be America's last Christmas. Evil is taking over the planet. They're destroying our
[1:16:08.920 --> 1:16:13.320]  borders, our sovereignty, our supply chains, our language, our currencies. They're coming
[1:16:13.320 --> 1:16:18.120]  after us. And if we don't support American businesses, and if we don't support independent
[1:16:18.120 --> 1:16:25.560]  media in the final days of 2021, we have no future in the midterms in 2022. 2022 is the year
[1:16:25.560 --> 1:16:30.760]  where America decides its fate. I want to thank you all for your support. I want to encourage
[1:16:30.760 --> 1:16:35.720]  you to your Christmas shopping and forward store.com because I can barely keep our operation going.
[1:16:35.720 --> 1:16:40.600]  And I appreciate you keeping us in the position to fight back. I am so thankful for you. And I'm
[1:16:40.600 --> 1:16:45.320]  asking you now to realize the huge investment you made over the years in us, and I'll redouble

[1:16:57.160 --> 1:17:01.720]  and keep us on the air. Thank you. Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in
[1:17:01.720 --> 1:17:06.360]  Tennessee. Welcome. Hello, Alex. Yes, Malcolm. All right, I will make this quick and real short
[1:17:06.360 --> 1:17:11.320]  where the other Patriots can get on the line. Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your
[1:17:11.320 --> 1:17:17.080]  co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, Supermail Vitality and Brainforce Plus. Mix those two together,
[1:17:17.080 --> 1:17:22.440]  you're an unstoppable tank. Supermail Vitality really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs
[1:17:22.440 --> 1:17:28.920]  and natural compounds that have never been heated up. And so it has a dramatic effect compared to
[1:17:28.920 --> 1:17:33.640]  powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong. This is like a very fine
[1:17:33.640 --> 1:17:38.520]  wine. In fact, each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay.
[1:17:38.520 --> 1:17:41.880]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[1:17:41.880 --> 1:17:47.320]  That's just how it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like
[1:17:47.320 --> 1:17:59.000]  super strong. But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:04.520]  Ultimate Bone Broth is back and better than ever. And 20% off plus free shipping and double
[1:18:04.520 --> 1:18:08.680]  Patriot points for our new sale. After years of being off the shelves, we're bringing back
[1:18:08.680 --> 1:18:13.640]  one of the biggest fan favorite formulas ever. And it's now been reformulated as even stronger.
[1:18:13.640 --> 1:18:19.720]  It's Ultimate Bone Broth Plus. It's got concentrated high quality chicken broth protein,
[1:18:19.720 --> 1:18:25.320]  turmeric root that's so amazing, chaga mushroom, beef pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder.
[1:18:25.320 --> 1:18:30.360]  And it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes. It's got real organic
[1:18:30.360 --> 1:18:35.640]  cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt. It even
[1:18:35.640 --> 1:18:39.880]  tastes better than the last formula. And what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[1:18:39.880 --> 1:18:46.040]  Again, it has that cutting edge chicken broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and
[1:18:46.040 --> 1:18:49.800]  dissolvability. You're going to love this. And when it does for your joints, what it does for
[1:18:49.800 --> 1:18:54.280]  your body, it does for your bones. It's simply amazing. And it helps funding info war. This
[1:18:54.280 --> 1:19:00.360]  is really the best bone broth out there. So get yours at infowarstore.com today. I am a worldly
[1:19:00.360 --> 1:19:05.880]  person, meaning I like going to ball games. I like going to concerts. I like going to play golf.
[1:19:05.880 --> 1:19:11.640]  I like going out to dinner. I like the metropolitan life. I like everything that comes with this.
[1:19:11.640 --> 1:19:17.720]  But see, I have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of Democrat run cities,
[1:19:17.720 --> 1:19:22.920]  get the hell out of major metropolitan areas. Because unless we change course soon, it's all
[1:19:22.920 --> 1:19:27.320]  crashing down. Is it time to just move out to the woods, just time to go get a piece of property
[1:19:27.320 --> 1:19:31.480]  in the woods, just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the land?
[1:19:31.480 --> 1:19:35.240]  That's the survival instinct. But see the worldly part of me that's still probably the
[1:19:35.240 --> 1:19:40.040]  majority part of me says, no, no, no, no, no, stay in the city. The survival instinct says,
[1:19:40.040 --> 1:19:43.640]  get the hell out of anywhere they've ever notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[1:19:43.640 --> 1:19:49.400]  That's the that's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing
[1:19:49.400 --> 1:19:55.080]  as well. But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies. And so
[1:19:55.080 --> 1:20:04.760]  we have the best ones at infowarstore.com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world
[1:20:04.760 --> 1:20:07.080]  order. It's Alex Jones.
[1:20:25.960 --> 1:20:29.800]  I remember in 13 years old,
[1:20:29.800 --> 1:20:36.680]  while my uncle was sitting there in his garage in San Antonio, Texas, working on a car engine.
[1:20:39.080 --> 1:20:42.840]  And I said, I'm a Republican. I like the Republican party.
[1:20:44.200 --> 1:20:47.480]  And he turned around and looked at me and he said, here, go get yourself a
[1:20:48.760 --> 1:20:51.640]  soft drink out of the refrigerator and let's sit down here in the backyard and let's talk
[1:20:51.640 --> 1:20:56.040]  a few minutes. He had grease all over him. And he sat down for about two hours and told me how
[1:20:56.040 --> 1:21:05.560]  the cow ate the cabbage. He didn't really tell me anything secret. But he told me a lot and it
[1:21:05.560 --> 1:21:10.680]  sounded crazy when I was here. But you know, it was all true.
[1:21:15.720 --> 1:21:20.840]  And he got a lot of silver stars in Vietnam. He was a great patriot. He thought he was working
[1:21:20.840 --> 1:21:24.600]  for the government thought he was saving America thought he was a good guy till he actually got
[1:21:24.600 --> 1:21:30.360]  in the middle of it and found out what was really going on. And you know, all of us are at that
[1:21:30.360 --> 1:21:36.200]  point now, whether we worked for the CIA or whether you work to the army or whether you were a
[1:21:36.200 --> 1:21:39.880]  school teacher, whether you work for the FBI or whether you work in a present, whether you work
[1:21:39.880 --> 1:21:45.480]  at a grocery store or a farmer, we're all in this thing now. And people better wake up and realize
[1:21:45.480 --> 1:21:51.160]  how much damn danger we're in. That's why I get so pissed when callers call in who are great people
[1:21:51.160 --> 1:21:56.840]  and say, you're such a hero. I'm a hero not signing on to pedophilia and Satanism. Well,
[1:21:56.840 --> 1:22:02.360]  if that's heroes, then we got a problem. How about I'm not doing that. How about I can't be part of
[1:22:02.360 --> 1:22:15.400]  that. How about we all decide we're not living like this. And here we are inside the new world order
[1:22:15.400 --> 1:22:20.600]  where every day we're on air is incredibly precious. We can be taken off the air anytime. That means
[1:22:20.600 --> 1:22:24.920]  all of you at the same time. I mean, I'm going to get these clips and then your calls. But let me
[1:22:24.920 --> 1:22:32.920]  explain where I'm coming from. I knew last year, six months before that they were going to do the
[1:22:32.920 --> 1:22:38.920]  Red Mirage scam because they admitted it. I know the difference between their propaganda versus
[1:22:38.920 --> 1:22:43.880]  their orders going out to their people. You always, you know, grow up watching movies about spy
[1:22:43.880 --> 1:22:50.600]  movies where the Russians or whatever would put like ads their spies in the newspaper ads.
[1:22:53.480 --> 1:22:59.240]  That actually went on. But that's what the globalists do. They sit there and do these drills
[1:22:59.240 --> 1:23:03.400]  and have these symposiums and they don't even hide what they're saying at these damn things.
[1:23:03.400 --> 1:23:07.960]  And I'm sitting there watching them prepare this whole plan for us. It's not the Russians coming
[1:23:07.960 --> 1:23:12.360]  after us. The chai comms are just some globalist play land where they can dehumanize do whatever
[1:23:12.360 --> 1:23:24.360]  they want. And I'm just sitting here watching them swallow up and destroy the whole country.
[1:23:24.360 --> 1:23:28.520]  And I forget the point I was even going to make getting into that. He'll come back to my mind
[1:23:28.520 --> 1:23:40.520]  in a moment. But here's what people need to know. Mass crimes against children are going on,
[1:23:40.520 --> 1:23:45.560]  giving them shots that erase their immune systems and create basically an HIV
[1:23:46.920 --> 1:23:52.840]  AIDS type illness in billions of people. And that's confirmed now and blood clots and cancer and
[1:23:52.840 --> 1:24:04.760]  all these problems. And we just can't sit here and act like this isn't going on. So the good news is
[1:24:04.760 --> 1:24:14.040]  the bad news is so horrible with the system going after the children that massive top scientists,
[1:24:14.040 --> 1:24:18.600]  when I say massive, I mean, massive numbers are now going, okay, it's all preplanned. It's a take
[1:24:18.600 --> 1:24:22.760]  over. It's period. Well, they want to kill you. It's a great reset. They already all know that.
[1:24:22.760 --> 1:24:27.720]  I mean, you don't just think Alex Jones and millions of you know that, right? No, they know that.
[1:24:27.720 --> 1:24:38.120]  And so we're living in this. This is real. And if you're freaked out, you should be freaked out.
[1:24:38.120 --> 1:24:44.680]  And if you feel unstable, you should be because this is a destabilized time. You're not supposed
[1:24:44.680 --> 1:24:49.000]  to feel normal during something like this. You're not supposed to be happy going to the movies and
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:53.320]  going to eat your food and going to playing golf or whatever and you know, polishing your car and
[1:24:53.320 --> 1:24:58.200]  playing with your favorite, you know, video games, that's all fine and dandy. If we weren't going to
[1:24:58.200 --> 1:25:04.200]  hell in a hand basket, but evil through the medical system has made its move. It's the population
[1:25:04.200 --> 1:25:11.800]  move on humanity. It's here now. And so all of you that are upset and all of you that have anxiety,
[1:25:11.800 --> 1:25:19.960]  myself included, it's because we're not doing enough to fight. We're not doing enough to fight
[1:25:19.960 --> 1:25:28.360]  it's because we're not doing enough to fight this thing. And we have a responsibility to
[1:25:28.360 --> 1:25:35.320]  fight this thing and we're not going to feel good and be close to God until we defeat this system.
[1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:38.920]  So let me just start. I got to get to these clips. It's about 12 minutes of them,
[1:25:38.920 --> 1:25:43.400]  15 minutes of them. And then we're going to go to your phone calls. This is Dr. Peter McCullough
[1:25:43.400 --> 1:25:52.920]  on Joe Rogan clip three. It seems to me early on there was an intentional, very comprehensive
[1:25:52.920 --> 1:25:59.240]  suppression of early treatment all over the world unified by the UN in order to promote
[1:25:59.240 --> 1:26:05.160]  fear, suffering, isolation, hospitalization and death. So an organized movement to cause death.
[1:26:06.280 --> 1:26:11.880]  Just like Governor Cuomo, all of it. He was given orders that this is real. This is happening.
[1:26:11.880 --> 1:26:17.640]  Lying to yourself, living in denial is not going to get you out of this. Playtime is over, folks.
[1:26:17.640 --> 1:26:18.680]  Here it is.
[1:26:18.680 --> 1:26:23.480]  All type of drug therapy is an outpatient works substantially. And we've had a giant loss of
[1:26:23.480 --> 1:26:28.680]  life, a giant number, millions and millions of unnecessary hospitalizations. And it seemed to
[1:26:28.680 --> 1:26:34.360]  me, and I told Tucker Carlson and many others, it seems to me early on, there was an intentional,
[1:26:34.360 --> 1:26:40.360]  very comprehensive suppression of early treatment in order to promote fear, suffering, isolation,
[1:26:40.360 --> 1:26:45.720]  hospitalization and death. And it seemed to be completely organized and intentional in order
[1:26:45.720 --> 1:26:53.320]  to create acceptance for and then promote mass vaccination. So you believe this is a premeditated
[1:26:53.880 --> 1:27:00.120]  thing that they were doing? So they realized that in order to get people enthusiastic about
[1:27:00.120 --> 1:27:04.200]  taking this vaccine, the best way to do that was to not have a protocol for treatment.
[1:27:04.840 --> 1:27:09.000]  It's not just my idea. Now it's completely laid out by the book by Dr. Pam Popper,
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:13.400]  the book recently published by Peter Bragan, COVID-19 and the Global Predators. We are the prey.
[1:27:13.400 --> 1:27:19.160]  I wrote one of the introductions. Dr. Leafley and Dr. Vlad Moranco wrote the other introductions.
[1:27:19.160 --> 1:27:25.400]  These books are basically nonfiction. They have a thousand citations in the Bragan book showing
[1:27:25.400 --> 1:27:30.680]  how it was coordinated and planned. Now Bobby Kennedy has his book out, The Real Anthony Fauci,
[1:27:30.680 --> 1:27:36.120]  the most mentioned physician in that book. I can tell you that if you want to find the evidence
[1:27:36.120 --> 1:27:41.240]  that Moderna was working on the vaccine before the virus ever emanated out of the lab, if you
[1:27:41.240 --> 1:27:46.120]  wanted to find the collusions and the operations between the Gates Foundation at Gavi and Seppi
[1:27:46.120 --> 1:27:50.520]  and Pfizer and Moderna and the vaccine manufacturers and the Wilhelm lab and the National Institutes
[1:27:50.520 --> 1:27:54.120]  of Health and Ralph Barrick and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and how all this was
[1:27:54.120 --> 1:27:59.240]  organized. If you want to see the Johns Hopkins planning seminar called the Spars Pandemic in
[1:27:59.240 --> 1:28:03.720]  2017 where they had a symposium, people showed up, they wrote up their symposium findings,
[1:28:03.720 --> 1:28:08.680]  they published this. It says it's going to be a coronavirus. It's going to be related to MERS
[1:28:08.680 --> 1:28:12.600]  and SARS. It's going to come over here to the United States. It's going to shut down cities
[1:28:12.600 --> 1:28:16.360]  and frighten people. There's going to be confusion regarding a drug, hydroxychloroquine
[1:28:16.360 --> 1:28:20.280]  and ivermectin and we're going to utilize all that in order to railroad the population into
[1:28:20.280 --> 1:28:25.080]  mass vaccination. It's laid out in the Johns Hopkins Spars Pandemic training seminar. The
[1:28:25.080 --> 1:28:29.000]  only thing they got wrong was the year. They said it was going to be 2025. Instead, it landed a few
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:34.360]  years early. Now you saw, it's almost a year ago, break all that down, but now you see it externalized
[1:28:34.360 --> 1:28:38.920]  the general population of the mass. This is what your support and prayer and word of mouth has done.
[1:28:38.920 --> 1:28:43.960]  You are the tip of the spear. You are changing the world. You are the resistance. You are the
[1:28:43.960 --> 1:28:48.360]  heroes. So thank you all for what you've done. More of Dr. Peter McCullough and Joe Rogus straight

[1:30:08.920 --> 1:30:13.320]  accept that there is an incredibly evil group of people in the world that are attempting the great
[1:30:13.320 --> 1:30:19.320]  reset and want a one world corporate government, then you can learn how to defeat them by learning
[1:30:19.320 --> 1:30:25.640]  their war game strategies and how to not play the game. After decades of intense research,

[1:30:34.040 --> 1:30:41.160]  have begun. Start your journey at resetwars.com today. Your programming are very subconscious
[1:30:41.160 --> 1:30:46.920]  and our psyche to create these false constructs that they then control. We're going to lay out
[1:30:46.920 --> 1:30:52.760]  how that works your journey against tyranny and true empowerment begins at resetwars.com. Please
[1:30:52.760 --> 1:31:03.560]  join me there. The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of
[1:31:03.560 --> 1:31:09.560]  today. Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental
[1:31:09.560 --> 1:31:15.240]  injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease. The perpetrators
[1:31:15.240 --> 1:31:20.360]  of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an
[1:31:20.360 --> 1:31:26.040]  artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years. For those of us who have awoken from
[1:31:26.040 --> 1:31:31.480]  the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see, but there
[1:31:31.480 --> 1:31:37.240]  is only two things to do. We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game. If enough
[1:31:37.240 --> 1:31:42.840]  people awaken from the cold spell, then we win. But even when we win and we eventually will,
[1:31:42.840 --> 1:31:47.880]  the days of convenience are soon coming to an end and so we must prepare, get up to a
[1:31:47.880 --> 1:31:55.080]  years worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios and life
[1:31:55.080 --> 1:32:02.520]  saving knowledge at infoorstore.com. All right, ladies and gentlemen, keep us on air. We'll

[1:32:33.720 --> 1:32:37.160]  just a great thing for kids. I mean, we could just do marketing campaigns. I think, I think
[1:32:37.160 --> 1:32:44.280]  for kids, that'd be great. Calcium good for them, the vitamin D. So that's at infowarstore.com.

[1:33:36.840 --> 1:33:43.880]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance, live from Austin, Texas,
[1:33:43.880 --> 1:33:47.720]  broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:47.720 --> 1:33:59.480]  All right, we're playing clips of Dr. Peter McCullough on my good friend Joe Rogan's transmission.
[1:34:00.200 --> 1:34:03.080]  Told you a year and a half ago, Joe was moving to Austin. Broke you here.
[1:34:04.360 --> 1:34:07.400]  Over a year and a half ago. Now, I told you he was going to get hardcore once he had control
[1:34:07.400 --> 1:34:12.280]  of his show. Told you he was totally awake. Before, he was a smart guy and knew I was right
[1:34:12.280 --> 1:34:15.720]  about a lot of stuff, but he thought there were a lot of good elites that didn't mean all this
[1:34:15.720 --> 1:34:23.400]  bad. Now, he knows. Now, he's in bare on its hind legs mode. And I just told you I didn't lie to you
[1:34:23.400 --> 1:34:30.280]  again. A year and a half ago, listeners were so pissed. Joe Rogan screwed him. Now, did I lie to
[1:34:30.280 --> 1:34:38.920]  you? Did I lie to you, baby? I tell you, honey, did I say something that wasn't true? I mean,
[1:34:38.920 --> 1:34:45.320]  sometimes I make mistakes, but the big main of what I do is the truth. And again, it's just an
[1:34:45.320 --> 1:34:51.480]  example of how we're winning. You're winning. And yeah, stuff's dark, stuff's bad, stuff's scary,
[1:34:51.480 --> 1:34:56.600]  but we're winning. It should be a high body count in this whole deal. We're trying to save as many
[1:34:56.600 --> 1:35:02.920]  children as we can. So I'll be honest with you. Adults go along the system, they get killed,
[1:35:02.920 --> 1:35:08.520]  I'm not going to cry. But children, just like God looks at children as innocent and need to
[1:35:08.520 --> 1:35:15.400]  protect it. I'm following God's directive. You know, God's one trillion G broadcast I'm getting.
[1:35:15.400 --> 1:35:19.560]  And God just says, those are innocent people hadn't made their choices yet. You better protect them
[1:35:19.560 --> 1:35:26.760]  or I will destroy your ass. I'm like, yes, sir. No matter how many guns the enemy points at me,
[1:35:26.760 --> 1:35:30.440]  you're nothing compared to what's got the guns pointed to me. And I and I'm not doing out of fear
[1:35:30.440 --> 1:35:36.760]  of God, but you you fear the separation from God. That's God's biggest threat is I will separate
[1:35:36.760 --> 1:35:43.000]  myself from you. I will leave you. And I'm like, no, no, no, please don't leave me. Well, if we
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:50.440]  don't stand up for these children, God is going to leave us if we forsake these children. If we
[1:35:50.440 --> 1:35:57.080]  don't go to all the damn injection centers. And I told you it happened last weekend. I was going
[1:35:57.080 --> 1:36:03.400]  into a store to buy a new toothbrush and some other, you know, stuff I needed. I don't know who
[1:36:03.400 --> 1:36:07.480]  steals my comb brushes at my house, but they're always disappearing. So I go into Walgreens have
[1:36:07.480 --> 1:36:11.240]  been one of months and I just go back to the area back where they got the combs and toothpaste.
[1:36:11.240 --> 1:36:15.400]  There's like 15 kids with these mothers, all mothers wearing masks and the kids all look
[1:36:15.400 --> 1:36:22.040]  scared or injecting them in this little room. And I got physically ill because I was realizing
[1:36:22.040 --> 1:36:26.680]  you should be boycotting these every weekend. You should be fighting for them. You should be
[1:36:27.960 --> 1:36:32.360]  I physically knew they were being given cancer. They were being given blood clots. They were
[1:36:32.360 --> 1:36:37.400]  being given death. And I was just there nonchalantly getting my natural mouthwash and toothpaste and
[1:36:38.120 --> 1:36:41.080]  or not toothpaste, I already have toothpaste, but toothbrush I was missing.
[1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:48.360]  And toothpicks, little toothpicks I use. So there we are, ladies and gentlemen. That's
[1:36:49.240 --> 1:36:53.320]  where we are. I was also buying some aspirin for my heart. Now we're getting what I was buying there
[1:36:53.320 --> 1:36:57.640]  and some toys for my four-year-old daughter and then some chocolate bars. But the point is,
[1:36:57.640 --> 1:37:04.680]  is that that's what was going on at this place and you should be sickened by that. You should
[1:37:04.680 --> 1:37:08.760]  be upset by that. So let's display a bunch of these clips. Let's just go in order. I don't know
[1:37:08.760 --> 1:37:11.960]  which one's the best. They're all powerful. We already played him saying it's all preventative
[1:37:11.960 --> 1:37:16.920]  takeover. Let's just start with clip one, two, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Just go right
[1:37:16.920 --> 1:37:21.720]  through them. Here they are. It's a supply or a very large supply more than adequate for the entire
[1:37:21.720 --> 1:37:26.840]  population for monoclonal antibodies. So what is stopping the distribution of them? Because not
[1:37:26.840 --> 1:37:33.400]  only have they made it difficult to get in Texas, they actually put these parameters on who gets
[1:37:33.400 --> 1:37:40.040]  it and who doesn't. And you have to be in a high risk ethnicity to get it. A friend of mine went,
[1:37:40.040 --> 1:37:48.040]  he had COVID and he is a healthy Caucasian male in his 30s. And they told him, you are not qualified
[1:37:48.040 --> 1:37:53.960]  to receive the monoclonal antibodies. And the lady who's working there said, if you were another
[1:37:53.960 --> 1:38:00.120]  ethnicity, like if you were Hispanic or black, then we would qualify you. And she was like,
[1:38:00.120 --> 1:38:05.480]  this is not my idea. I just have to follow the rules. Why would anybody establish rules like
[1:38:05.480 --> 1:38:09.400]  that? What is that? And they're so arbitrary from center to center, the arbitrariness of the rules.
[1:38:09.400 --> 1:38:13.480]  I've sent younger patients who have severe symptoms and in trouble for monoclonal antibodies,
[1:38:13.480 --> 1:38:17.800]  they've been turned down. I've had other people go for monoclonal antibodies themselves and get
[1:38:17.800 --> 1:38:20.840]  them find no difficulty. Most of the time, I have to say I've had a great experience,
[1:38:20.840 --> 1:38:24.200]  people who got the monoclonal antibodies, but I have to tell you an anecdote. Somebody close
[1:38:24.200 --> 1:38:29.480]  in my religious circles developed COVID-19 and he developed some severe respiratory symptoms.
[1:38:30.120 --> 1:38:36.440]  And I had gotten wind of vaccine discrimination, Joe. I had gotten wind of this and this person
[1:38:36.440 --> 1:38:39.720]  was not vaccinated. I said, we're going to go for monoclonal antibody infusion. It's late on a
[1:38:39.720 --> 1:38:43.800]  Saturday night. He goes for the monoclonal antibody infusion and the doctor at the center in Dallas
[1:38:43.800 --> 1:38:50.120]  lords over him, arms folded and says, have you been vaccinated? And this person looks up on him.
[1:38:50.120 --> 1:38:55.000]  He says, I refuse to answer that question. And the doctor looked at him, he said, okay, he goes,
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:57.960]  and the person who came and said, listen, I just want a monoclonal antibody infusion,
[1:38:57.960 --> 1:39:02.200]  go home. He gets the monoclonal antibody infusion and on the way out the door, he goes, hey doc,
[1:39:02.200 --> 1:39:06.360]  he goes, what if I would have answered that question if then told you I was vaccinated?
[1:39:06.360 --> 1:39:11.480]  He goes, oh, I would have given you remdesivir. Of the 800,000 deaths that we are right now,
[1:39:11.480 --> 1:39:16.520]  I can tell you to a one, they've received either no or inadequate early treatment.
[1:39:16.520 --> 1:39:22.200]  All of them. Go look in a table of baseline characteristics of hospitalized patients with
[1:39:22.200 --> 1:39:26.920]  COVID-19 and look at what they received before they came to the hospital. Zilch. In fact,
[1:39:26.920 --> 1:39:31.560]  there's one paper by Ip and colleagues, first name, last name is spelled IP. It was published
[1:39:31.560 --> 1:39:36.440]  from New Jersey early on. And in that paper, back when there was a surge of hydroxychloroquine use
[1:39:36.440 --> 1:39:41.720]  in the spring of 2020, 7% of people had received some pre-hospital hydroxychloroquine before they
[1:39:41.720 --> 1:39:47.080]  got to the hospital. They had improved survival. Even some pre-hospital treatment really worked.
[1:39:47.080 --> 1:39:50.520]  So what happened is when we came up with our treatment protocols, the protocol that I mentioned,
[1:39:50.520 --> 1:39:53.960]  it sounds like describing what you received as a treatment. You basically received the
[1:39:53.960 --> 1:39:57.400]  McCulloch protocol. It's now been copyrighted. Sequence multi-drug. When some monoclonal antibodies
[1:39:57.400 --> 1:40:01.400]  came in, that became a building block in our program. And we can maybe show that multi-drug
[1:40:01.400 --> 1:40:07.000]  protocol on the screen if we can look at it. The point is that any pre-hospital treatment
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:10.520]  was associated with improved survival because we're taking an edge off our application,
[1:40:10.520 --> 1:40:13.960]  reducing some of the inflammation, prevent them of the thrombosis. If we let this thing
[1:40:13.960 --> 1:40:18.680]  run for 14 days, Joe, the lungs are filling with blood clots. By the time the oxygen saturation
[1:40:18.680 --> 1:40:23.160]  goes down, that's not the virus. The Italians showed us through autopsy studies, very courageous
[1:40:23.160 --> 1:40:28.360]  autopsy studies, the lungs are filled with micro blood clots. The Naval cruise ship,
[1:40:28.360 --> 1:40:33.960]  3,700 individuals fully vaccinated. They passed Delta to each other. Then we had these papers here.
[1:40:33.960 --> 1:40:38.680]  We have one from Haver CDC COVID Network. We have Fillmore from the VA. This is data
[1:40:38.680 --> 1:40:43.320]  shading into June. This is for Delta really kicked up. We had 23% of Americans in the hospital with
[1:40:43.320 --> 1:40:46.600]  who were vaccinated, but they had COVID-19. Remember in June, remember that talking point
[1:40:46.600 --> 1:40:54.280]  that was issued? 99% of people in the hospital were unvaccinated. That's propaganda. That's
[1:40:54.280 --> 1:40:58.040]  false information put out by those in position of authority. There was one time, and I was on
[1:40:58.040 --> 1:41:02.200]  Laura Ingraham, and they had a montage of everybody saying 99% unvaccinated. Even the
[1:41:02.200 --> 1:41:06.680]  governor of Florida said that. President of the United States said that. That was a false talking
[1:41:06.680 --> 1:41:13.080]  point that was issued, and everybody said it. I think designed to encourage people to get vaccinated.
[1:41:13.080 --> 1:41:15.400]  Well, that's certainly been a lot of encouragement to get vaccinated.
[1:41:15.400 --> 1:41:20.760]  As what's going on here is that we have a situation where we have people in positions
[1:41:20.760 --> 1:41:25.640]  of authority. The person you had on here in a position of authority was Sanjay Gupta, and I'm
[1:41:25.640 --> 1:41:31.000]  going to pick on one a little bit because Sanjay Gupta came on Sesame Street, and I want to show
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  the graphic. If I don't have it, he came on Sesame Street, and what he did is with another CNN
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:42.040]  correspondent, he was actually seducing children into taking the vaccine. Yeah, I saw that. He's
[1:41:42.040 --> 1:41:47.720]  very stubborn. Okay, seducing. I am telling you, no good doctor would do that because there must
[1:41:47.720 --> 1:41:52.760]  be risks and benefits. Did he tell the kids and the parents there's FDA warnings that this can
[1:41:52.760 --> 1:41:57.080]  cause heart inflammation? Did the other CNN correspondent, who's a mother, did she show
[1:41:57.080 --> 1:42:02.200]  even show an ounce of concern? What Scott Atlas uses in his book, Joe, the term he uses is off
[1:42:02.200 --> 1:42:07.080]  the rails. We're off the rails. People in positions of authority are doing bad things, trying to
[1:42:07.080 --> 1:42:11.960]  seduce children into taking a vaccine that has official FDA warnings on it without giving fair
[1:42:11.960 --> 1:42:16.520]  balance. That's malfeasance. That's wrongdoing by people in position of authority. Nobody can
[1:42:16.520 --> 1:42:21.240]  encourage somebody to take a vaccine, by the way. That violates the Nuremberg code. Can't do it.
[1:42:21.240 --> 1:42:26.600]  Research is neutral. As a doctor, I can never tell somebody they should take the COVID-19 vaccine.
[1:42:26.600 --> 1:42:30.520]  Why? Because same reason why I can't tell them, say, listen, you should be in my research study.
[1:42:30.520 --> 1:42:34.120]  You should take my research pill for diabetes. You know, if I told them that you should be in
[1:42:34.120 --> 1:42:39.080]  my research study, I'd be sanctioned by the IRB. I'd be called by the FDA. That's out of bounds.
[1:42:39.080 --> 1:42:44.520]  We never give any pressure, coercion, or threat of reprisal for participating research.
[1:42:44.520 --> 1:42:48.520]  Violates the Nuremberg code. And we certainly wouldn't do it with these vaccines because we
[1:42:48.520 --> 1:42:54.600]  don't have all the data yet. We have to reconcile with vaccine safety. So the story is, by January
[1:42:54.600 --> 1:42:58.280]  22nd, we already had 182 deaths. Stay with us. So this could be...
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:06.760]  Get our great bag of it here. I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico,
[1:43:06.760 --> 1:43:11.560]  the communists? Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested
[1:43:11.560 --> 1:43:16.280]  above organic in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee. And yeah, we buy it from the
[1:43:16.280 --> 1:43:19.880]  little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really they're just a commune.
[1:43:19.880 --> 1:43:23.720]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it. And the farmers don't
[1:43:23.720 --> 1:43:27.160]  let the Mexican government take over. So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been
[1:43:27.160 --> 1:43:30.840]  buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up. The same stuff sold at Whole Foods
[1:43:30.840 --> 1:43:35.240]  under another name for about 50% more per pound. And I just think it's some of the best coffee
[1:43:35.240 --> 1:43:39.400]  you're going to find anywhere. It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels,
[1:43:39.400 --> 1:43:48.200]  literally. In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story. I can't believe it. Anyway,
[1:43:48.200 --> 1:43:53.160]  so it's infowarstore.com. And that's how we fund this operation. And if you don't fund us,
[1:43:53.160 --> 1:43:54.280]  you don't want us here, that's fine.
[1:43:58.760 --> 1:44:03.880]  We've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp
[1:44:03.880 --> 1:44:08.440]  in World War Two that when they came for one group, he wasn't part of that group so he didn't
[1:44:08.440 --> 1:44:11.880]  stand up. And then when they came for another group, he wasn't part of that group so he didn't
[1:44:11.880 --> 1:44:16.840]  stand up. And finally, when they came for him, there was nobody else to stand up.
[1:44:16.840 --> 1:44:20.200]  Well, the Global Social Credit Score that China is putting in that's banning people
[1:44:20.200 --> 1:44:24.200]  to three hours of video games a week. And if you criticize the government, you can never buy
[1:44:24.200 --> 1:44:28.760]  or sell again. Well, that's that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise of
[1:44:28.760 --> 1:44:33.160]  COVID vaccine passports. They even admit it. Now they're saying it's going to be a
[1:44:33.160 --> 1:44:36.440]  carbon tax attached to it. They're going to track where you go and what you do and
[1:44:36.440 --> 1:44:40.600]  decide where you can go and what you can do. That's what the lockdowns are about.
[1:44:40.600 --> 1:44:45.640]  You'll accept that. You'll accept anything. So again, the left is having fun right now with
[1:44:45.640 --> 1:44:49.160]  all the censorship and tyranny pretending like they're part of the power structure.
[1:44:49.160 --> 1:44:52.840]  But they're all going to be targeted by this nightmare as well. We need to get back to basic
[1:44:52.840 --> 1:44:57.240]  human rights and promote them or all of us will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by
[1:44:57.240 --> 1:45:02.920]  the globalists. The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that
[1:45:02.920 --> 1:45:09.080]  there's a war between free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other
[1:45:09.080 --> 1:45:14.280]  who are literally trying to create a post-human world. From the United States to Brazil and
[1:45:14.280 --> 1:45:19.000]  of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations were pulling out of the private corporate
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:23.800]  fascist world government. That's why they launched their great reset and their program after
[1:45:23.800 --> 1:45:32.120]  collapsing us of Build Back Better. This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of
[1:45:32.120 --> 1:45:37.160]  the world economy because they couldn't take our guns and because we wouldn't bow because the left,
[1:45:37.800 --> 1:45:43.240]  which is the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win. They released a biological
[1:45:43.240 --> 1:45:49.480]  weapon on us. Now we know two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago. It's that simple.
[1:45:49.480 --> 1:45:53.880]  They can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns. So the global corporate combine
[1:45:53.880 --> 1:45:58.680]  released COVID-19 and you know the rest of history. Expose this paradigm and we win.
[1:45:58.680 --> 1:46:04.440]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming. They're here all over the world from Australia to the
[1:46:04.440 --> 1:46:09.560]  United States from Canada to Germany. These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go
[1:46:09.560 --> 1:46:15.160]  and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the
[1:46:15.160 --> 1:46:20.920]  night to their facilities and they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process
[1:46:20.920 --> 1:46:25.560]  where they come and take quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[1:46:25.560 --> 1:46:29.240]  This is nothing less than martial law and one big thing you can do to fight back
[1:46:29.240 --> 1:46:34.440]  is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very compliant
[1:46:34.440 --> 1:46:40.520]  meaning U.S. government military grade at infowarstore.com. We have the entire line of silent

[1:46:56.680 --> 1:47:05.960]  infowar at infowarstore.com. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:26.680 --> 1:47:39.320]  Life is older, older than the trees, Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze,
[1:47:39.320 --> 1:47:58.200]  Country roads, take me home to the place I love, West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home.
[1:47:58.200 --> 1:48:03.320]  Take me home. Country roads. Here we are ladies and gentlemen. I'm going to finish up with Dr. Peter
[1:48:03.320 --> 1:48:07.400]  McCullough. That last clip we're on, a few others and we're going to go right to your phone calls
[1:48:07.400 --> 1:48:12.040]  here throughout the entire third hour. Then Owen Schreuer is going to be taking over with some
[1:48:12.040 --> 1:48:16.600]  major breaking news information. But here's more of what they're trying to censor, what they're
[1:48:16.600 --> 1:48:21.960]  trying to block, the facts that they're killing us by design. This is a globalist corporate war.
[1:48:21.960 --> 1:48:27.720]  You're living in it. This is it. This is World War III. Here it is. We have to reconcile with
[1:48:27.720 --> 1:48:33.240]  vaccine safety. So the story is by January 22nd, we already had 182 deaths after the vaccine.
[1:48:33.240 --> 1:48:40.760]  January 22nd, for all the vaccines combined, 278 million shots given each year in the United States.
[1:48:40.760 --> 1:48:44.520]  Kids, adults, me and you, I took two last year, I took one this year, 270 million shots.
[1:48:44.520 --> 1:48:48.200]  The average number of deaths that would ever come into our central database, about 150.
[1:48:49.160 --> 1:48:54.280]  We've been keeping this database for 20 years. Suddenly we were at 182. And then it was a very
[1:48:54.280 --> 1:48:59.560]  important recognition that many of us had, say, wait a minute, the CDC and FDA, they didn't have any
[1:48:59.560 --> 1:49:03.880]  safety review. They didn't have an external critical event committee. They didn't have a data
[1:49:03.880 --> 1:49:07.960]  safety monitoring committee. And they didn't have a human ethics board assigned to the program.
[1:49:07.960 --> 1:49:12.120]  It turns out we had the wrong agencies leading the program. The FDA is supposed to be the drug
[1:49:12.120 --> 1:49:17.000]  watch government organization. They don't lead clinical programs. The CDC is supposed to be
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:21.400]  the outbreak evaluation program. They don't lead clinical programs. So in fact, we actually had
[1:49:21.400 --> 1:49:26.120]  the wrong, we had the innocence, the Fox guarding the chicken coop, in a sense, we had the wrong
[1:49:26.120 --> 1:49:29.560]  people leading the programs. And then we didn't have this independent safety committees. So there
[1:49:29.560 --> 1:49:34.600]  was nobody to stop the program in February. Normally what happens is you get five deaths
[1:49:34.600 --> 1:49:39.240]  after any product is unexplained. Black box morning may cause death. You get to 50 deaths.
[1:49:39.240 --> 1:49:42.920]  I don't care if it's 50 million, 60 million people take the drug. You get to 50 deaths,
[1:49:42.920 --> 1:49:46.440]  it's off the market, and it gets reviewed for safety. I've been involved with these Joe
[1:49:46.440 --> 1:49:51.000]  at a national level. We never let a drug go on and be associated with 50 deaths afterwards.
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:54.440]  We were at 182. And there was no safety review. Remember, I told you in February,
[1:49:54.440 --> 1:49:59.720]  I demanded, as a citizen, I demanded a report from the federal government. We needed a report
[1:49:59.720 --> 1:50:03.560]  and a press briefing on vaccine safety efficacy. We never got it. And Finland was by Arola and
[1:50:03.560 --> 1:50:07.640]  colleagues. They came with the estimate of four cases per million per year as a baseline.
[1:50:07.640 --> 1:50:11.640]  So that means in the United States, 400, 800 cases a year, we've already gotten to
[1:50:11.640 --> 1:50:16.680]  over 13,000 cases in the United States. And we've seen cases of myocarditis, by the way,
[1:50:16.680 --> 1:50:21.800]  reported the U.S. military, been reported from Israel, France, and elsewhere, the paper that
[1:50:21.800 --> 1:50:25.320]  showed it directly invades the heart, the spike protein, that was by Avoglio and colleagues in
[1:50:25.320 --> 1:50:30.440]  their pericytes. And very importantly, the prognosis is what you're asking about. The prognosis
[1:50:30.440 --> 1:50:35.960]  paper was published by Karsten Chopi, and that was in circulation research 2019. And what it showed
[1:50:35.960 --> 1:50:41.640]  is it showed that 13% of myocarditis, this before COVID, ends up with progressive heart failure
[1:50:41.640 --> 1:50:47.720]  and worsening. My fear is, some of these kids who develop myocarditis will be in a 13% category
[1:50:47.720 --> 1:50:50.280]  where they have progressive left and chico dysfunction and heart failure.
[1:50:50.280 --> 1:50:56.840]  So the myocarditis they're experiencing right now is damaged heart tissue, and that damaged
[1:50:56.840 --> 1:50:59.880]  heart tissue is not going to heal, and that in fact might get worse.
[1:51:00.600 --> 1:51:05.640]  The estimates are, and again, I'm applying data from other forms of myocarditis before COVID.
[1:51:05.640 --> 1:51:05.880]  Yes.
[1:51:05.880 --> 1:51:09.320]  And COVID looks like a pretty severe form of it, to be honest with you, because it's putting
[1:51:10.120 --> 1:51:13.720]  86% of the kids in the hospital. There's myocarditis that we actually don't hospitalize. We can
[1:51:13.720 --> 1:51:17.000]  treat myocarditis and myopericarditis in the office, but these kids are sick enough to be
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:21.720]  hospitalized. I'm inferring that it's severe forms of it. This estimate from this paper
[1:51:21.720 --> 1:51:28.360]  would be 13% risk in these kids of developing heart failure or needing things like ICDs,
[1:51:28.360 --> 1:51:31.720]  heart failure, oral drugs, later on cardiac transplant or cardiac death.
[1:51:32.680 --> 1:51:36.680]  And now we've learned we can use hydrogen peroxide, dilute hydrogen peroxide with some
[1:51:36.680 --> 1:51:40.520]  lukewarm iodine. And believe it or not, the dentists in the American Dental Association
[1:51:40.520 --> 1:51:44.360]  guidelines used for cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus, gingivitis, they use
[1:51:44.360 --> 1:51:48.360]  sodium hypochlorite. That's actually dilute bleach. Turns out it just takes a few drops of
[1:51:48.360 --> 1:51:51.400]  bleach in some household water. That's for the mouth. We typically don't use it in the nose
[1:51:51.400 --> 1:51:55.320]  around the eyes. But remember when President Trump mentioned bleach and everybody had a big
[1:51:55.320 --> 1:51:58.680]  horse laugh on that? It turns out he just couldn't articulate. Someone was giving him
[1:51:58.680 --> 1:52:04.280]  the ADA recommendations for antiviral therapy for the mouth. The point is pillar number one
[1:52:04.280 --> 1:52:07.000]  should have been contagion control. It should have been focused on the nose and the mouth.
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:10.600]  We learned it early. We learned it late, but if we could have used any of that early, it would
[1:52:10.600 --> 1:52:15.000]  have helped. Randomized trials of masks didn't work. Hand sanitizers and spraying football
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:17.480]  stadiums. There was even in Europe, they were spraying the sidewalk. That doesn't work.
[1:52:17.480 --> 1:52:21.000]  Do you think the masks have any effect on the limiting the spread?
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:26.280]  Every time I go on Fox News, Laura Ingham always tees up some comment on masks. And I just
[1:52:26.280 --> 1:52:31.800]  maxed. Masks are not my signature focus, right? And the reason being, if two people don't have
[1:52:31.800 --> 1:52:36.680]  the virus and they wear a mask, can it possibly do anything? Of course not. So in randomized
[1:52:36.680 --> 1:52:39.400]  trials of masks, the vast majority of people don't have the virus. So if you put masks on
[1:52:39.400 --> 1:52:44.360]  people who don't have the virus, it's not going to do anything. Mask expert, Mr. Stephen Petty,
[1:52:44.360 --> 1:52:48.360]  who I've presented with, he is a world's expert on masks. He's an engineer with a typical mask
[1:52:48.360 --> 1:52:52.520]  that someone wears. Do you know much air moves around the mask? Is 18% moves around the mask?
[1:52:52.520 --> 1:52:56.360]  Of course it doesn't work. Masks only filter out about three microns. The virus is one micron.
[1:52:56.360 --> 1:53:00.440]  So the point is, what do masks do? Do I wear a mask? Sure. I'm a doctor. I go into the hospital.
[1:53:00.440 --> 1:53:04.840]  I'm in the cath lab. I'm close contact with people, dentists, hairdressers, people at close
[1:53:04.840 --> 1:53:10.120]  range wear a mask. It may stop a big sneeze. It may stop partially some big emanation of
[1:53:10.120 --> 1:53:15.960]  inoculum. But we shouldn't have had the airtime and the public health focus on masks. I think
[1:53:15.960 --> 1:53:19.640]  if we would have taken all of that energy and put it on treatment protocols and update on drugs,
[1:53:19.640 --> 1:53:21.000]  we would have been better off. But that's contagious.
[1:53:23.240 --> 1:53:27.320]  They don't want this information on air. That's why we're here. That's why we're the tip of the
[1:53:27.320 --> 1:53:31.160]  spear. That's why we're not financed by George Soros and the globalists. We're just a billion
[1:53:31.160 --> 1:53:35.000]  bucks to give a dose. We can all sit on our ass. We're financed by you, the listeners and viewers.
[1:53:35.800 --> 1:53:40.680]  And it's only when you decide to spread the word or share an article or share a video that it has
[1:53:40.680 --> 1:53:46.040]  an effect. That's why I just sit here all day saying, don't thank me. Thank yourself when you
[1:53:46.040 --> 1:53:50.200]  share an article, when you share a video, when you're hopeful, hey, Alex has got this big guest
[1:53:50.200 --> 1:53:56.040]  on. Tune in. It's the power of you taking action, the establishment fears. All right, we're going
[1:53:56.040 --> 1:54:02.360]  to go to break in about four minutes. We're going to come back with William, Lori, Alex, Julie,
[1:54:03.160 --> 1:54:09.400]  Jason, Daniel, Kyle, Jordan, Truth Teller, Brad, John, we'll get to every one of those
[1:54:09.400 --> 1:54:13.640]  callers. We're not going to take any more after that because they keep loading them on the board.
[1:54:13.640 --> 1:54:19.480]  We're going to take those 11 calls next hour and then Owen Schreuer takes over.
[1:54:20.680 --> 1:54:23.720]  There's a lot of other geopolitical news. There's a lot of inflation news, a lot of
[1:54:23.720 --> 1:54:26.280]  race betting news. I'm going to hit as well. I'm going to hit some more of that in a second.
[1:54:27.080 --> 1:54:34.040]  But seriously, anything I promote, anything I sell is something I really believe in.
[1:54:34.040 --> 1:54:37.400]  So all the supplements are great and the books, the films, the water filtration,
[1:54:37.400 --> 1:54:41.480]  the air filtration, it's all really high quality products at great prices that then also
[1:54:41.480 --> 1:54:47.160]  keep us on air. So it's a 360 win. But reset wars is going
[1:54:47.160 --> 1:54:56.760]  to not be discounted tonight at midnight, midnight central or 1159 central. It goes
[1:54:56.760 --> 1:55:00.760]  to full price, which is fine. It's great. You're going to support us and I appreciate it. But I
[1:55:00.760 --> 1:55:04.520]  would go get reset wars now. You know, you're supporting the broadcast. You know, you're
[1:55:04.520 --> 1:55:08.760]  fun on the tip of the spear. Plus it's really something different. We haven't covered yet.
[1:55:08.760 --> 1:55:12.840]  It gets to the mind, the soul, the body. We slowly go through it with all the documents
[1:55:12.840 --> 1:55:17.560]  and research. It's really a six, almost seven hour documentary. It's two courses,
[1:55:18.520 --> 1:55:23.960]  mind wars, spirit wars. And they just send you the video and you can open it and use it and
[1:55:23.960 --> 1:55:27.640]  watch it anytime you want. Share it with your family, show it at your church, whatever you're
[1:55:27.640 --> 1:55:35.480]  going to do. And yes, it funds our operation. So if you want 25% off on reset wars, the first
[1:55:35.480 --> 1:55:43.560]  big installment, it's available now at reset wars.com. And I got to tell you, I mean, if people
[1:55:43.560 --> 1:55:47.320]  actually know how real this is and actually research this, and if you use this and the
[1:55:47.320 --> 1:55:53.240]  teach others, it's game over the globalist. It's versus who they program and who they try to create
[1:55:53.240 --> 1:55:59.240]  versus who you are and who God made. And this is from a scientific quantum mechanics, quantum
[1:55:59.240 --> 1:56:04.920]  physics perspective. So I got to tell you, folks, just going there and getting the course will
[1:56:04.920 --> 1:56:08.840]  keep us on air and let us actually expand. So that's an important move. And I'm asking you to
[1:56:08.840 --> 1:56:12.360]  do it right now. If you care about what we're doing, I really appreciate you standing with us
[1:56:12.360 --> 1:56:17.400]  in the past. But now is the time as we enter the critical fight, go to reset wars.com,
[1:56:17.400 --> 1:56:19.800]  sign up, get the course, share with your friends and family.
[1:56:21.880 --> 1:56:27.960]  Just funding us is a win. The only lose is you not taking action and doing it. It's that simple.
[1:56:27.960 --> 1:56:31.320]  It's not like I'm up here saying all this hype and we haven't delivered. We're the zeitgeist
[1:56:31.320 --> 1:56:36.520]  together. Us, this audience and myself, you are info wars. You understand that? I'm not just saying
[1:56:36.520 --> 1:56:41.720]  that you are the info war. So become a member now so much more can be rolled out from this
[1:56:42.600 --> 1:56:45.240]  and we'll be able to bring the price way down once the infrastructure is built.
[1:56:46.280 --> 1:56:51.320]  But you're the founders, you're the people in on the bottom floor that bet it all and go in and do
[1:56:51.320 --> 1:56:58.280]  it. For the fraction of an NBA or NFL ticket, you can see this amazing course and support the
[1:56:58.280 --> 1:57:02.680]  broadcast. So I'm going to ask you again, are you going to support us or are you just going to act
[1:57:02.680 --> 1:57:06.520]  like you support Liberty? You're just tuned in to hear what Alex Jones is saying. This is something
[1:57:06.520 --> 1:57:10.200]  you need. It's something you need to share. You may already know all this stuff. Great. Get the
[1:57:10.200 --> 1:57:16.840]  course, support the broadcast, share it with your friends and family reset wars.com reset wars.com
[1:57:16.840 --> 1:57:22.920]  tonight at 1159 p.m. Central. It will no longer be 25% off. So take advantage of that right now
[1:57:22.920 --> 1:57:29.320]  and reset wars.com. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to come back in our number three
[1:57:29.320 --> 1:57:36.520]  with your phone calls in T minus. What's two minutes? 120 seconds. So we'll be right back
[1:57:36.520 --> 1:57:43.160]  as we lead up to the end of 2021 and the year of the tiger 2022. Stay with us.
[1:57:43.160 --> 1:57:54.040]  So this could be this could be in full wars last Christmas because it could be America's
[1:57:54.040 --> 1:57:59.240]  last Christmas. Evil is taking over the planet. They're destroying our borders, our sovereignty,
[1:57:59.240 --> 1:58:04.600]  our supply chains, our language, our currencies. They're coming after us. And if we don't support
[1:58:04.600 --> 1:58:09.800]  American businesses and if we don't support independent media in the final days of 2021,
[1:58:09.800 --> 1:58:17.640]  we have no future in the midterms in 2022. 2022 is the year where America decides its fate. I want

[1:59:55.080 --> 2:00:16.520]  info wars tomorrow's news today.
[2:00:25.080 --> 2:00:35.080]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God is Alex Jones.
[2:00:35.080 --> 2:00:45.080]  There are things the enemy of humanity don't want us to know.
[2:00:45.080 --> 2:00:47.080]  There are secrets they want to keep.
[2:00:47.080 --> 2:00:53.080]  I'm Alex Jones, and I've made it my life mission to expose those secrets and empower humanity.
[2:00:53.080 --> 2:00:56.080]  And I've made my greatest discovery yet.
[2:00:56.080 --> 2:01:11.080]  Join me there as humanity goes the next level at resetwars.com.
[2:01:11.080 --> 2:01:17.080]  It is said that the gods left steel on the field of battle and man discovered it.
[2:01:17.080 --> 2:01:23.080]  It is said by the Greeks that Prometheus was given the fire of God.
[2:01:23.080 --> 2:01:30.080]  Well, those fables, those stories are only our types of the truth that in our mind, in our psyche, in our soul,
[2:01:30.080 --> 2:01:32.080]  they have a connection to the higher dimensions.
[2:01:32.080 --> 2:01:39.080]  You can reach forward into that and already are born with Promethean fire.
[2:01:39.080 --> 2:01:50.080]  That's what we cover at resetwars.com. You'd be a fool, a fool not to go, not to watch it, not to keep us on air,
[2:01:50.080 --> 2:01:52.080]  and to get this incredible information.
[2:01:52.080 --> 2:01:57.080]  Keeping us on air is such a small part of that, but it's also the key.
[2:01:57.080 --> 2:02:04.080]  So much of me doesn't want to be up here constantly on air, constantly battling, constantly fighting, constantly begging.
[2:02:04.080 --> 2:02:08.080]  But that's the nature of liberty. It's struggling.
[2:02:08.080 --> 2:02:13.080]  The globalists just sit there and give trillions of themselves and everything's opulent and super yachts
[2:02:13.080 --> 2:02:16.080]  and everything's taken care of. There's never a question in the world.
[2:02:16.080 --> 2:02:23.080]  There's never a worry about payroll and there's always just, they serve Satan. It's so easy.
[2:02:23.080 --> 2:02:28.080]  They can just float around this big hot tub of Satanism and not worry.
[2:02:28.080 --> 2:02:35.080]  But for me and for you, we're constantly struggling to pay the bills to live our lives, to take care of our children.
[2:02:35.080 --> 2:02:41.080]  But that's okay because if you're put into a position on this planet where you're not having to worry about stuff,
[2:02:41.080 --> 2:02:43.080]  you are under Satan's control.
[2:02:43.080 --> 2:02:53.080]  Christ said, blessed are those that seek my name and support me and worship God with me because you're going to be persecuted.
[2:02:53.080 --> 2:02:57.080]  Blessed are those that are persecuted. You're going to be persecuted.
[2:02:57.080 --> 2:03:01.080]  I mean, I'm butchering it, but you can pull up the clothes for yourself.
[2:03:01.080 --> 2:03:05.080]  I'm sure they'll got some Pharisee, fake Christian life. He didn't quote it right.
[2:03:05.080 --> 2:03:08.080]  That's a satanic devil quote. I'm just going from memory here.
[2:03:08.080 --> 2:03:11.080]  Ain't no satanic devil quote.
[2:03:11.080 --> 2:03:14.080]  Oh, I am a wicked devil. I love Jesus. I want Jesus to save me.
[2:03:14.080 --> 2:03:17.080]  I'm not like you. How good you are. Everything else.
[2:03:17.080 --> 2:03:21.080]  I'll rip your spinal cord out. I'll gouge your eyeballs out, you little glitter bug.
[2:03:21.080 --> 2:03:24.080]  I'm not up here like I'm some precious creature.
[2:03:24.080 --> 2:03:31.080]  I want to, I'm hanging on like the fall of Saigon.
[2:03:31.080 --> 2:03:37.080]  I'm hanging on to the helicopter skids like get me out of here. Get me out of here.
[2:03:37.080 --> 2:03:40.080]  I'm not up here like on some high and mighty.
[2:03:40.080 --> 2:03:48.080]  I'm this big Christian. I'm so good and I've thought all the rules and I'm perfect and why God's even proud of me.
[2:03:48.080 --> 2:03:50.080]  How upright I am.
[2:03:50.080 --> 2:03:54.080]  No, I'm hanging on. Guys, pull on the fall of Vietnam 1975.
[2:03:54.080 --> 2:03:56.080]  Hanging off helicopters. Hanoi.
[2:03:56.080 --> 2:03:59.080]  No, Hanoi's in the north. Befall of Saigon.
[2:03:59.080 --> 2:04:02.080]  I mean, show people when we come back.
[2:04:02.080 --> 2:04:06.080]  The fall of Saigon, U.S. troops hanging off helicopter skids.
[2:04:06.080 --> 2:04:11.080]  See, I'm not up here bad asshole gleaming of Victor, all this power.
[2:04:11.080 --> 2:04:14.080]  Oh, I'm this big smart guy. I'm New World Order.
[2:04:14.080 --> 2:04:16.080]  I'm Bill Gates. Oh, look at me.
[2:04:16.080 --> 2:04:18.080]  No, I'm hanging on to helicopter.
[2:04:18.080 --> 2:04:21.080]  Ah, please get me out of here. Please, please help me.
[2:04:21.080 --> 2:04:23.080]  Please, oh God, I'm hanging on the helicopter.
[2:04:23.080 --> 2:04:26.080]  You understand? I'm hanging on to the helicopter skids.
[2:04:26.080 --> 2:04:30.080]  That's me with crap running down my leg.
[2:04:30.080 --> 2:04:33.080]  Please, please, no, help me.
[2:04:33.080 --> 2:04:35.080]  I'm asking the angels up in the helicopter.
[2:04:35.080 --> 2:04:37.080]  We reached down. We're not sure.
[2:04:37.080 --> 2:04:39.080]  I'm like, please, please, I'm trying. I want to be good.
[2:04:39.080 --> 2:04:41.080]  Please help me. Help me. Help me.
[2:04:41.080 --> 2:04:43.080]  They're like, we're not sure yet.
[2:04:43.080 --> 2:04:45.080]  Maybe you got to fall again.
[2:04:45.080 --> 2:04:49.080]  And I look down. I'm about to fall into it. I say, no, no, no.
[2:04:49.080 --> 2:04:52.080]  They're like, you didn't do enough and they kick your fingers off.
[2:04:52.080 --> 2:04:57.080]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[2:04:57.080 --> 2:05:26.080]  Everything I do.
[2:05:27.080 --> 2:05:30.080]  We also have COVID-land 2, the mask film.

[2:05:49.080 --> 2:05:52.080]  This could be potentially your last chance to get a t-shirt,
[2:05:52.080 --> 2:05:54.080]  a book, a film, or these great supplements.
[2:05:54.080 --> 2:05:57.080]  We're going to keep going 110%, but we need your support.
[2:06:24.080 --> 2:06:29.080]  Here we are. All right, I appreciate William and Laurie and Alex and Julie
[2:06:29.080 --> 2:06:31.080]  and everybody that's patiently holding.
[2:06:31.080 --> 2:06:36.080]  Let me see who's been holding the longest here.
[2:06:36.080 --> 2:06:38.080]  Let's talk to Jordan in New Jersey first.
[2:06:38.080 --> 2:06:40.080]  Jordan in New Jersey.
[2:06:40.080 --> 2:06:44.080]  Thanks for calling you're on the air. God bless you.
[2:06:44.080 --> 2:06:46.080]  Peace be with you, Brother Alex.
[2:06:46.080 --> 2:06:48.080]  Thank you, Brother.
[2:06:48.080 --> 2:06:52.080]  So I just wanted to kind of do a little soliloquy here.
[2:06:52.080 --> 2:06:57.080]  My daughter, I put her in private school after I saw what was coming with the public schools.
[2:06:57.080 --> 2:06:59.080]  And so they started injecting these kids.
[2:06:59.080 --> 2:07:04.080]  The parents are willingly offering these children to MOLOC in the volcano,
[2:07:04.080 --> 2:07:07.080]  whatever you want to use as far as an ancient example.
[2:07:07.080 --> 2:07:10.080]  And the kids are getting sick, of course.
[2:07:10.080 --> 2:07:13.080]  And the teachers are getting sick with these boosters.
[2:07:13.080 --> 2:07:17.080]  And it's getting really strange.
[2:07:17.080 --> 2:07:21.080]  On top of that, I just wanted to also report to everybody, including yourself,
[2:07:21.080 --> 2:07:24.080]  I've seen extraordinarily increased activity.
[2:07:24.080 --> 2:07:29.080]  I've never seen before of black hawk helicopters over my house.
[2:07:29.080 --> 2:07:33.080]  I live in suburban New Jersey, not near any military installations.
[2:07:33.080 --> 2:07:35.080]  Gunships.
[2:07:35.080 --> 2:07:41.080]  My neighbors have seen them, which I just wanted to also report to you.
[2:07:41.080 --> 2:07:49.080]  Now, in addition to that, I want to talk about all the new revelations,
[2:07:49.080 --> 2:07:54.080]  as we call them, of the DNA repair issue that you've been identifying
[2:07:54.080 --> 2:07:56.080]  and these other studies have been identifying,
[2:07:56.080 --> 2:08:05.080]  which almost is exactly what happens when the body is bombarded by high energy microwave radiation,
[2:08:05.080 --> 2:08:07.080]  as well as cosmic rays.
[2:08:07.080 --> 2:08:14.080]  So this ties into things that we haven't been really keeping track of through all this,
[2:08:14.080 --> 2:08:19.080]  which is the Army has quietly been, have you heard, and please tell me if you had,
[2:08:19.080 --> 2:08:23.080]  of the JADC2 program that the military is running?
[2:08:23.080 --> 2:08:25.080]  Refresh my memory.
[2:08:25.080 --> 2:08:26.080]  Okay.
[2:08:26.080 --> 2:08:34.080]  So, JADC2, which is the acronym for Joint All Domain Command and Control,
[2:08:34.080 --> 2:08:39.080]  which is the DOD sweeping effort to digitally interconnect its weapons systems and sensors
[2:08:39.080 --> 2:08:42.080]  across all military branches.
[2:08:42.080 --> 2:08:46.080]  Sure, that's all cyber command censorship, Greg.
[2:08:46.080 --> 2:08:50.080]  Exactly, which relies upon what? 5G, right?
[2:08:50.080 --> 2:08:56.080]  So during the lockdowns, they were placing, you know, I'm a local attorney and I've had people call me,
[2:08:56.080 --> 2:09:01.080]  they're placing 5G towers all over the place, and you've reported on this as well.
[2:09:01.080 --> 2:09:06.080]  And you had Dr. Meridon, yes, they're talking about this connection with 5G and so forth.
[2:09:06.080 --> 2:09:13.080]  So I find it very odd that the exact effect that the vaccine causes as far as the DNA damage
[2:09:13.080 --> 2:09:20.080]  is almost the exact effect that high frequency doses of this 5G radiation and cosmic radiation causes.
[2:09:20.080 --> 2:09:21.080]  You know?
[2:09:21.080 --> 2:09:31.080]  And again, the cosmic radiation comes in, in floods, but on time and it's continual until it stabs.
[2:09:31.080 --> 2:09:36.080]  The 5G is turning on and off constantly, which our cells have never experienced in their own studies.
[2:09:36.080 --> 2:09:37.080]  That's how they're controlling it.
[2:09:37.080 --> 2:09:38.080]  Thank you, Jordan.
[2:09:38.080 --> 2:09:39.080]  Really, really great points.
[2:09:39.080 --> 2:09:41.080]  Let's get to all these callers.
[2:09:41.080 --> 2:09:43.080]  They're all amazing.
[2:09:43.080 --> 2:09:47.080]  Let's go ahead and take another call from Jason in Texas.
[2:09:47.080 --> 2:09:49.080]  He's bringing up 5G as well.
[2:09:49.080 --> 2:09:53.080]  And Greg Reese's report here today, Jason, go ahead.
[2:09:53.080 --> 2:09:56.080]  Yeah, well, it's about two months ago.
[2:09:56.080 --> 2:10:04.080]  I was just feeling really weak and just kind of sick and finally I went into the doctor about two weeks ago
[2:10:04.080 --> 2:10:13.080]  and I had low hemoglobin and now, I guess, my red blood and they don't think nothing of it.
[2:10:13.080 --> 2:10:23.080]  And then until I saw Greg Reese's report and then you had the lady on last night, you know, yesterday about talking about this stuff.
[2:10:23.080 --> 2:10:30.080]  I 100% believe that, of course, now I got a 5G phone because that's all they have now, you know.
[2:10:30.080 --> 2:10:34.080]  Yeah, but just because your phone says it works with 5G doesn't mean it's 5G.
[2:10:34.080 --> 2:10:37.080]  It just means it's 5G enabled.
[2:10:37.080 --> 2:10:42.080]  So, but no, I truly believe that's where it's from.
[2:10:42.080 --> 2:10:45.080]  You know, now I'm on these iron pills and all that.
[2:10:45.080 --> 2:10:51.080]  Oh, there's so many documented studies and you mentioned the Greg Reese report that has some of them
[2:10:51.080 --> 2:10:57.080]  that it pushes oxygen out of the blood and that it's a really powerful transmitter when you're up close to it like a microwave,
[2:10:57.080 --> 2:11:01.080]  not like a microwave that is a microwave and that it's out of control.
[2:11:01.080 --> 2:11:03.080]  I mean, they are killing us, folks.
[2:11:03.080 --> 2:11:05.080]  This is a takeover.
[2:11:05.080 --> 2:11:06.080]  Thank you, Jason.
[2:11:06.080 --> 2:11:07.080]  Yeah.
[2:11:07.080 --> 2:11:08.080]  Go ahead, Jason.
[2:11:08.080 --> 2:11:10.080]  You want to add something else?
[2:11:10.080 --> 2:11:25.080]  Well, I was just going to say, well, the pedophile puppet down in Kentucky touring the tornado disaster and he happened to bring along a COVID vaccine team to get people vaccinated if they want or boosters.
[2:11:25.080 --> 2:11:27.080]  I just think that's disgusting.
[2:11:27.080 --> 2:11:32.080]  Well, you know, the only thing that's similar between the unvaxxed and the vaxxed is you're never fully vaxxed.
[2:11:32.080 --> 2:11:36.080]  And the worst part about the first 15 days of letting the curbs the first two years.
[2:11:36.080 --> 2:11:38.080]  Thank you, Jason.
[2:11:38.080 --> 2:11:41.080]  All right, let's go to Lori in Idaho.
[2:11:41.080 --> 2:11:42.080]  Lori, you're on the air.
[2:11:42.080 --> 2:11:43.080]  Thank you for calling.
[2:11:43.080 --> 2:11:45.080]  Go ahead.
[2:11:45.080 --> 2:11:47.080]  It's finally talked to you.
[2:11:47.080 --> 2:11:50.080]  I've been a long time listener since 2011.
[2:11:50.080 --> 2:11:52.080]  Lori, thank you for calling.
[2:11:52.080 --> 2:11:53.080]  We love you.
[2:11:53.080 --> 2:11:54.080]  Go ahead.
[2:11:54.080 --> 2:12:01.080]  And 2011, I kind of seen a lot of stuff corruption going on in the accounting office I worked in.
[2:12:01.080 --> 2:12:02.080]  Well, it was all true.
[2:12:02.080 --> 2:12:03.080]  I got terminated.
[2:12:03.080 --> 2:12:04.080]  I got this.
[2:12:04.080 --> 2:12:06.080]  My tribe disconnected me from them.
[2:12:06.080 --> 2:12:09.080]  I live on an Indian reservation out in Idaho.
[2:12:09.080 --> 2:12:15.080]  Anyway, last week I took my daughter in line to the hospital.
[2:12:15.080 --> 2:12:17.080]  She went into the hospital to go have her baby.
[2:12:17.080 --> 2:12:19.080]  She wasn't until the 10th.
[2:12:19.080 --> 2:12:23.080]  They pulled that baby out of her on Wednesday.
[2:12:23.080 --> 2:12:32.080]  And on Friday, the 10th, CPS and the detective came in and gave her one sheet of paper and said,
[2:12:32.080 --> 2:12:37.080]  we're taking your baby because your test came back with drugs in it.
[2:12:37.080 --> 2:12:38.080]  Wow.
[2:12:38.080 --> 2:12:42.080]  So we're fighting tooth and nail to try to get that baby back.
[2:12:42.080 --> 2:12:44.080]  Well, I'm sorry to hear that's happening.
[2:12:44.080 --> 2:12:46.080]  But yeah, the system's totally predatory.
[2:12:46.080 --> 2:12:48.080]  And half the time those tests are fake.
[2:12:48.080 --> 2:12:50.080]  But again, the government ships the fentanyl in.
[2:12:50.080 --> 2:12:52.080]  They banned the ivermectin.
[2:12:52.080 --> 2:12:54.080]  And then it was 20 smokes, marijuana.
[2:12:54.080 --> 2:12:57.080]  They take their children from them to say you're an illegal alien.
[2:12:57.080 --> 2:12:59.080]  I mean, then they'll let you go.
[2:12:59.080 --> 2:13:01.080]  Say you're a communist.
[2:13:01.080 --> 2:13:08.080]  And so I had her do the vaccine waiver out of Idaho where they can't vaccinate the baby.
[2:13:08.080 --> 2:13:11.080]  And that CPS worker said, who told you to do this?
[2:13:11.080 --> 2:13:13.080]  Who's telling you to do this?
[2:13:13.080 --> 2:13:15.080]  She said, I'm doing it on my own.
[2:13:15.080 --> 2:13:19.080]  I said, you tell them that you're not going to be on welfare.
[2:13:19.080 --> 2:13:21.080]  You're going to pay for the baby's hospital bills.
[2:13:21.080 --> 2:13:24.080]  We have a family pediatrician.
[2:13:24.080 --> 2:13:30.080]  And this young lady is adopted daughter out of Salt Lake.
[2:13:30.080 --> 2:13:32.080]  She was only eight years old.
[2:13:32.080 --> 2:13:33.080]  Well, Lori, God bless you.
[2:13:33.080 --> 2:13:35.080]  You know, the state's wedging war on our children.
[2:13:35.080 --> 2:13:36.080]  It's not our government.
[2:13:36.080 --> 2:13:37.080]  It's not our state.
[2:13:37.080 --> 2:13:39.080]  And there's good people in it, but the overall system's bad.
[2:13:39.080 --> 2:13:40.080]  God bless you.
[2:13:40.080 --> 2:13:41.080]  And thank you for the call.
[2:13:41.080 --> 2:13:42.080]  We're going to all these calls.
[2:13:42.080 --> 2:13:44.080]  Halux in Seattle.
[2:13:44.080 --> 2:13:46.080]  Halux, you're on the air.
[2:13:46.080 --> 2:13:48.080]  Go ahead.
[2:13:48.080 --> 2:13:49.080]  Yes.
[2:13:49.080 --> 2:13:52.080]  It's actually Halux.
[2:13:52.080 --> 2:13:53.080]  Halux.
[2:13:53.080 --> 2:13:54.080]  XAV or XAV.
[2:13:54.080 --> 2:13:55.080]  Yeah.
[2:13:55.080 --> 2:13:57.080]  I want to do a couple of books.
[2:13:57.080 --> 2:14:01.080]  X2, we've been, I've been thinking for a few years now.
[2:14:01.080 --> 2:14:07.080]  When you see a lot of people that are 20 year olds and look older than you,
[2:14:07.080 --> 2:14:10.080]  then you know, you know, something is working.
[2:14:10.080 --> 2:14:18.080]  So one is that the other one is Fiverr greens or greens, green fiber.
[2:14:18.080 --> 2:14:24.080]  That one, actually my wife suffers from digestive problems and that helps a lot.
[2:14:24.080 --> 2:14:25.080]  So she's happy with that one.
[2:14:25.080 --> 2:14:27.080]  And many other other products as well.
[2:14:27.080 --> 2:14:29.080]  Well, thanks for the support, brother.
[2:14:29.080 --> 2:14:31.080]  What's on your mind?
[2:14:31.080 --> 2:14:36.080]  Well, we are actually working with the Spanish counterpart of info wars info.
[2:14:36.080 --> 2:14:41.080]  Guerra is a YouTube channel with 162,000 subscribers.
[2:14:41.080 --> 2:14:43.080]  I've been seeing that.
[2:14:43.080 --> 2:14:44.080]  Yeah.
[2:14:44.080 --> 2:14:45.080]  Great job, brother.
[2:14:45.080 --> 2:14:46.080]  That's God bless you.
[2:14:46.080 --> 2:14:47.080]  We are.

[2:14:59.080 --> 2:15:01.080]  Guerra's USA info.

[2:15:10.080 --> 2:15:11.080]  Guerra.
[2:15:11.080 --> 2:15:13.080]  We're waking the Spanish people up.
[2:15:13.080 --> 2:15:14.080]  I know you are.
[2:15:14.080 --> 2:15:15.080]  I saw you.

[2:15:17.080 --> 2:15:18.080]  Good job.
[2:15:18.080 --> 2:15:19.080]  Yeah.
[2:15:19.080 --> 2:15:21.080]  So we are promoting the action.
[2:15:21.080 --> 2:15:23.080]  Take the action into your own hands.
[2:15:23.080 --> 2:15:26.080]  The more people we wake people up, the more people are going to act.
[2:15:26.080 --> 2:15:27.080]  And that's right.
[2:15:27.080 --> 2:15:29.080]  Well, I love your spirit.
[2:15:29.080 --> 2:15:30.080]  And how do I say it?
[2:15:30.080 --> 2:15:31.080]  I say it.
[2:15:31.080 --> 2:15:32.080]  Alex.
[2:15:32.080 --> 2:15:33.080]  It's actually havoc.
[2:15:33.080 --> 2:15:34.080]  It's like havoc.
[2:15:34.080 --> 2:15:36.080]  X a V o X.
[2:15:36.080 --> 2:15:37.080]  Oh, I got it.
[2:15:37.080 --> 2:15:38.080]  Alex.
[2:15:38.080 --> 2:15:39.080]  Okay.
[2:15:39.080 --> 2:15:40.080]  I got it.
[2:15:40.080 --> 2:15:41.080]  It's just an H on screen.
[2:15:41.080 --> 2:15:42.080]  Thank you and God bless you.
[2:15:42.080 --> 2:15:43.080]  Wow.
[2:15:43.080 --> 2:15:44.080]  Amazing talking to folks like that.
[2:15:44.080 --> 2:15:45.080]  Just incredible.
[2:15:45.080 --> 2:15:47.080]  I mean, we're hit folks.
[2:15:47.080 --> 2:15:48.080]  We're the resistance.
[2:15:48.080 --> 2:15:49.080]  It's not high.
[2:15:49.080 --> 2:15:50.080]  It's not like we're up.
[2:15:50.080 --> 2:15:51.080]  We're the resistance.
[2:15:51.080 --> 2:15:52.080]  No, we are it.
[2:15:52.080 --> 2:15:56.080]  They're injecting children with HIV creating systems.
[2:15:56.080 --> 2:15:57.080]  Hey, everybody.
[2:15:57.080 --> 2:16:02.080]  If you've hit our great bag of it here.
[2:16:02.080 --> 2:16:06.080]  I mean, this is from people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico?
[2:16:06.080 --> 2:16:07.080]  The communists.
[2:16:07.080 --> 2:16:11.080]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above
[2:16:11.080 --> 2:16:14.080]  organic in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[2:16:14.080 --> 2:16:18.080]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communist,
[2:16:18.080 --> 2:16:22.080]  they're just a commune and whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got
[2:16:22.080 --> 2:16:23.080]  it.
[2:16:23.080 --> 2:16:24.080]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[2:16:24.080 --> 2:16:28.080]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what 14 years
[2:16:28.080 --> 2:16:29.080]  and the price has never gone up.
[2:16:29.080 --> 2:16:33.080]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[2:16:33.080 --> 2:16:36.080]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[2:16:36.080 --> 2:16:37.080]  It's wake up America.
[2:16:37.080 --> 2:16:39.080]  Patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels.
[2:16:39.080 --> 2:16:40.080]  Literally.
[2:16:40.080 --> 2:16:45.080]  In fact, I'm going to tell you a little story.
[2:16:45.080 --> 2:16:51.080]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[2:16:51.080 --> 2:17:01.080]  And if you don't find us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[2:17:01.080 --> 2:17:02.080]  Jacob in Ohio.
[2:17:02.080 --> 2:17:03.080]  Welcome.
[2:17:03.080 --> 2:17:04.080]  Go ahead.
[2:17:04.080 --> 2:17:05.080]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[2:17:05.080 --> 2:17:06.080]  Good, bro.
[2:17:06.080 --> 2:17:07.080]  Great last caller.
[2:17:07.080 --> 2:17:09.080]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[2:17:09.080 --> 2:17:14.080]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, the moralization
[2:17:14.080 --> 2:17:15.080]  and absurdity.
[2:17:15.080 --> 2:17:17.080]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[2:17:17.080 --> 2:17:18.080]  All right.
[2:17:18.080 --> 2:17:19.080]  Eric in New Hampshire.
[2:17:19.080 --> 2:17:20.080]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[2:17:20.080 --> 2:17:21.080]  Go ahead.
[2:17:21.080 --> 2:17:22.080]  Hey, Alex.
[2:17:22.080 --> 2:17:23.080]  Thanks for taking my call.
[2:17:23.080 --> 2:17:25.080]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[2:17:25.080 --> 2:17:26.080]  The X2 does wonders.
[2:17:26.080 --> 2:17:29.080]  I recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[2:17:29.080 --> 2:17:30.080]  Get off the fence.
[2:17:30.080 --> 2:17:31.080]  Get the product.
[2:17:31.080 --> 2:17:32.080]  Support the infowar.

[2:17:34.080 --> 2:17:35.080]  Thanks for rolling.
[2:17:35.080 --> 2:17:36.080]  Go ahead.
[2:17:36.080 --> 2:17:37.080]  Hey, Alex.
[2:17:37.080 --> 2:17:38.080]  It's great to be on with you.
[2:17:38.080 --> 2:17:39.080]  It's an honor.
[2:17:39.080 --> 2:17:40.080]  Honored to talk to you.
[2:17:40.080 --> 2:17:41.080]  Awesome.
[2:17:41.080 --> 2:17:44.080]  I love the products, alpha power, even at 29.
[2:17:44.080 --> 2:17:48.080]  If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom.
[2:17:48.080 --> 2:17:50.080]  So just number one for two or three.
[2:17:50.080 --> 2:17:51.080]  I like that one.
[2:17:51.080 --> 2:17:52.080]  It works.
[2:17:52.080 --> 2:17:53.080]  It's not a joke.

[2:18:18.080 --> 2:18:19.080]  Don't.

[2:20:28.600 --> 2:20:29.600]  End of the night.
[2:20:29.600 --> 2:20:32.200]  The bright midnight.
[2:20:32.200 --> 2:20:34.120]  End of the night.
[2:20:34.120 --> 2:20:35.480]  End of the night.
[2:20:35.480 --> 2:20:37.360]  Rounds of wind.
[2:20:37.360 --> 2:20:39.080]  So we're taking your phone calls right now,
[2:20:39.080 --> 2:20:40.880]  and we're just in such an epic time.
[2:20:40.880 --> 2:20:43.480]  I'm just blown away to be here.
[2:20:43.480 --> 2:20:45.200]  Such a crazy world.
[2:20:45.200 --> 2:20:46.920]  And I've got so many news clips of things
[2:20:46.920 --> 2:20:49.440]  I haven't covered yet, but we're taking your phone calls
[2:20:49.440 --> 2:20:50.240]  right now.
[2:20:50.240 --> 2:20:52.720]  So let's go right back to your calls.
[2:20:52.720 --> 2:20:53.560]  We got Julie.
[2:20:53.560 --> 2:20:54.360]  We got Daniel.
[2:20:54.360 --> 2:20:55.040]  We got Kyle.
[2:20:55.040 --> 2:20:57.840]  We got Truth Teller.
[2:20:57.840 --> 2:20:58.560]  We got Brad.
[2:20:58.560 --> 2:20:59.840]  We got John.
[2:20:59.840 --> 2:21:01.800]  And speaking of Truth Teller, let's
[2:21:01.800 --> 2:21:04.680]  go to Truth Teller right now from FEMA Region 5.
[2:21:04.680 --> 2:21:05.520]  Truth Teller, welcome.
[2:21:08.800 --> 2:21:10.840]  Yeah, hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[2:21:10.840 --> 2:21:11.840]  Good to have you here, brother.
[2:21:11.840 --> 2:21:12.600]  Go ahead.
[2:21:12.600 --> 2:21:13.080]  Yes, sir.
[2:21:13.080 --> 2:21:17.520]  It's Texas Truth Teller, but that's side issue.
[2:21:17.520 --> 2:21:19.400]  But first of all, I want to give a quick plug.
[2:21:19.400 --> 2:21:21.600]  I'm a competitive runner.
[2:21:21.600 --> 2:21:27.440]  And the combination of supermail vitality, ultra 12,
[2:21:27.440 --> 2:21:30.480]  and turbo force definitely gives me
[2:21:30.480 --> 2:21:34.040]  what I need to run competitively at age 62.
[2:21:34.040 --> 2:21:36.480]  And many times, I've been able to place
[2:21:36.480 --> 2:21:38.480]  first, second, or third in my age division,
[2:21:38.480 --> 2:21:42.760]  and then post-race the ultimate bone broth.
[2:21:42.760 --> 2:21:47.040]  I've been so, I was so glad when you got that back in stock.
[2:21:47.040 --> 2:21:48.680]  So great product.
[2:21:48.680 --> 2:21:49.600]  Well, thank you, brother.
[2:21:49.600 --> 2:21:51.480]  Tell us about how you run competitively,
[2:21:51.480 --> 2:21:53.400]  because I mean, we go out to the top labs
[2:21:53.400 --> 2:21:55.280]  and say, we want the best you've got.
[2:21:55.280 --> 2:21:57.080]  These ago, we could make it even better,
[2:21:57.080 --> 2:21:58.120]  but you got to pay more.
[2:21:58.120 --> 2:21:59.600]  So a lot of our products, like bodies,
[2:21:59.600 --> 2:22:03.000]  ultimate turmeric formula, our B12, all of them,
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:05.480]  are basically the highest level or levels
[2:22:05.480 --> 2:22:07.080]  no one's ever done before, because I'm not
[2:22:07.080 --> 2:22:08.640]  going to sell something that's BS.
[2:22:08.640 --> 2:22:11.200]  So tell us about your experience.
[2:22:11.200 --> 2:22:15.320]  Well, like, for instance, with the turbo force, OK.
[2:22:15.320 --> 2:22:19.680]  When I take that, Alex, I had a Thanksgiving day
[2:22:19.680 --> 2:22:21.880]  run just recently.
[2:22:21.880 --> 2:22:26.040]  And I placed second for men 60 to 64 in the race
[2:22:26.040 --> 2:22:28.920]  in just over 24 minutes.
[2:22:28.920 --> 2:22:31.800]  At age 62, I thank God for that.
[2:22:31.800 --> 2:22:33.880]  But your products have definitely
[2:22:33.880 --> 2:22:36.760]  been instrumental in my success as a runner.
[2:22:36.760 --> 2:22:39.600]  And everybody needs to support what you do there
[2:22:39.600 --> 2:22:40.840]  with Info or Store.
[2:22:40.840 --> 2:22:42.320]  So I want to give that plug now.
[2:22:42.320 --> 2:22:43.440]  Hey, great story, brother.
[2:22:43.440 --> 2:22:44.040]  Love to hear it.
[2:22:44.040 --> 2:22:47.240]  So Texas truth teller, tell us what else is going on.
[2:22:47.240 --> 2:22:51.320]  OK, so the reason I called, you know, this morning,
[2:22:51.320 --> 2:22:53.880]  Harrison Smith made a comment, which I agree.
[2:22:53.880 --> 2:22:55.840]  And I want to kind of expand on this a little bit
[2:22:55.840 --> 2:22:57.480]  without taking too much time.
[2:22:57.480 --> 2:23:02.040]  He said that this whole COVID situation, which, as we know,
[2:23:02.040 --> 2:23:07.880]  is a scamemic and a pandemic, it was an IQ test for America.
[2:23:07.880 --> 2:23:11.040]  And Alex, I've been watching people for years.
[2:23:11.040 --> 2:23:13.200]  I knew when they came out with these devices
[2:23:13.200 --> 2:23:16.480]  that they call phones that this is going to be trouble.
[2:23:16.480 --> 2:23:19.480]  They set people up for what they've now implemented.
[2:23:19.480 --> 2:23:22.040]  And here's the thing, even with everything
[2:23:22.040 --> 2:23:24.040]  the globalists are doing, how evil they are,
[2:23:24.040 --> 2:23:27.080]  I don't see them as the biggest enemy.
[2:23:27.080 --> 2:23:29.520]  I remember years ago when Tex Meyers
[2:23:29.520 --> 2:23:32.000]  interviewed in his documentary called
[2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:33.560]  Night Stalkers Over America.
[2:23:33.560 --> 2:23:35.800]  And you made a statement to him when he asked you,
[2:23:35.800 --> 2:23:39.000]  how do you deal with people that don't want to hear the truth?
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:41.880]  He said, well, you said, if they look at you
[2:23:41.880 --> 2:23:44.200]  like with a deer in the headlights there,
[2:23:44.200 --> 2:23:46.880]  just move on to somebody who'll listen and maybe pray.
[2:23:46.880 --> 2:23:50.640]  Well, you're an original, I'm sorry to interrupt, repeat
[2:23:50.640 --> 2:23:51.680]  what I said to Tex Meyers.
[2:23:51.680 --> 2:23:54.480]  You're right, you're an original gangster.
[2:23:54.480 --> 2:23:57.360]  That was over 20 plus years ago, that documentary.
[2:23:57.360 --> 2:23:59.680]  Wow, so you've been watching this for a long time.
[2:23:59.680 --> 2:24:01.640]  I mean, repeat what Tex said, God bless him.
[2:24:01.640 --> 2:24:03.520]  Went on to see the Lord a few years ago.
[2:24:03.520 --> 2:24:06.880]  In 1999, that's when I was made aware of you.
[2:24:06.880 --> 2:24:09.480]  And he asked you, how do you deal with people
[2:24:09.480 --> 2:24:12.680]  who don't want to hear what you know is true?
[2:24:12.680 --> 2:24:14.760]  And you said, well, other than pray for them,
[2:24:14.760 --> 2:24:17.080]  there's really nothing you can do when they're looking at you
[2:24:17.080 --> 2:24:19.720]  with this deer in the headlights there reaction
[2:24:19.720 --> 2:24:23.000]  and just move on to somebody who wants to hear it
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:24.520]  because you're wasting your time.
[2:24:24.520 --> 2:24:25.680]  And this is what I wanted to get at.
[2:24:25.680 --> 2:24:30.280]  Mike Adams, just recently on naturalnews.com,
[2:24:30.280 --> 2:24:33.040]  he posted something from Dietrich Bonhoeffer,
[2:24:33.040 --> 2:24:36.240]  a Lutheran pastor who was part of the resistance
[2:24:36.240 --> 2:24:37.240]  to actually-
[2:24:37.240 --> 2:24:39.120]  Sure, he said, first they came for this group,
[2:24:39.120 --> 2:24:40.400]  I wasn't them, I didn't do anything.
[2:24:40.400 --> 2:24:43.080]  And finally they came for me and there was nobody left, yeah.
[2:24:43.080 --> 2:24:44.720]  Yeah, no, that's a different pastor.
[2:24:44.720 --> 2:24:46.120]  But what he put forth was-
[2:24:46.120 --> 2:24:49.560]  I'll just write my memory, what did Bonhoeffer say?
[2:24:49.560 --> 2:24:51.880]  He called it the theory of stupidity.
[2:24:51.880 --> 2:24:54.240]  He said, you would be better off trying to deal
[2:24:54.240 --> 2:24:56.120]  with somebody and reason with them
[2:24:56.120 --> 2:24:58.200]  who was malicious in their attitudes
[2:24:58.200 --> 2:25:00.000]  than people who are stupid.
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:03.120]  No, I agree, like evil people shouldn't want the great reset.
[2:25:03.120 --> 2:25:06.000]  It's gonna make them, it kills almost everybody.
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:07.920]  Like no one should be for this.
[2:25:08.960 --> 2:25:11.800]  And I'll give you a couple of quick examples, Alex.
[2:25:11.800 --> 2:25:14.120]  Okay, I'm talking to a woman on the bus,
[2:25:14.120 --> 2:25:17.600]  I use the public transportation here in Florida.
[2:25:17.600 --> 2:25:20.840]  And the thing is, she says to me, this is a passenger,
[2:25:20.840 --> 2:25:23.160]  sir, you need to wear your mask.
[2:25:23.160 --> 2:25:25.280]  And I looked at her, so I finally got it out,
[2:25:25.280 --> 2:25:26.920]  I stuck it on my chin and I go, there,
[2:25:26.920 --> 2:25:27.880]  do you feel happy now?
[2:25:27.880 --> 2:25:29.120]  I said, you know what this is?
[2:25:29.120 --> 2:25:30.880]  This is a COVID-19 pacifier.
[2:25:30.880 --> 2:25:33.120]  She's looking at me with this dumb look.
[2:25:33.120 --> 2:25:36.160]  And I said to her, and then I said, you know,
[2:25:36.160 --> 2:25:37.840]  Jesus doesn't want me to wear that
[2:25:37.840 --> 2:25:39.680]  because it's bad for my health.
[2:25:39.680 --> 2:25:42.680]  And she says, well, but you know, if you're a Christian,
[2:25:42.680 --> 2:25:44.160]  we're supposed to honor the government,
[2:25:44.160 --> 2:25:47.720]  but we're on a bus, we're not even in a government facility.
[2:25:47.720 --> 2:25:49.160]  I know, I hear you, I appreciate your call,
[2:25:49.160 --> 2:25:52.160]  Texas street teller, look, in Florida.
[2:25:52.160 --> 2:25:53.480]  Look, here's the deal.
[2:25:54.600 --> 2:25:57.040]  Christ was being in front of the Pharisees
[2:25:57.040 --> 2:25:58.760]  saying you shouldn't pay your taxes,
[2:25:58.760 --> 2:26:01.040]  knowing he'd be executed if he said you shouldn't.
[2:26:01.040 --> 2:26:03.720]  So he said, that Caesar's face on the coin,
[2:26:03.720 --> 2:26:05.480]  give him what is his.
[2:26:05.480 --> 2:26:07.040]  I mean, no kidding, it's like his coin,
[2:26:07.040 --> 2:26:09.280]  it's his system, he issued it.
[2:26:09.280 --> 2:26:11.960]  Render on the Caesar, those things that are Caesar's
[2:26:11.960 --> 2:26:14.480]  to God, things that are God, that makes total sense.
[2:26:15.640 --> 2:26:16.760]  You're in somebody's house,
[2:26:16.760 --> 2:26:19.000]  you're doing somebody's system, that's theirs,
[2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:21.840]  but give to God the things that are God.
[2:26:21.840 --> 2:26:25.200]  So the idiots that try to use Roman 13, like Hitler did,
[2:26:25.200 --> 2:26:29.280]  to control people are just either control freaks or liars.
[2:26:29.280 --> 2:26:31.040]  All right, thank you, truth teller.
[2:26:32.080 --> 2:26:35.160]  Let's go ahead and talk to Julie in the tri-state area.
[2:26:35.160 --> 2:26:37.360]  Julie, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[2:26:38.520 --> 2:26:39.520]  Alex, hi.
[2:26:39.520 --> 2:26:40.360]  Welcome.
[2:26:41.600 --> 2:26:44.120]  I've been kind of focusing on social media
[2:26:44.120 --> 2:26:45.200]  while I've been on hold with you.
[2:26:45.200 --> 2:26:47.040]  And did you know today is the year anniversary
[2:26:47.040 --> 2:26:50.080]  since they started giving these things to people?
[2:26:50.080 --> 2:26:51.080]  Yes.
[2:26:51.080 --> 2:26:53.680]  It's trending today, get boosted.
[2:26:53.680 --> 2:26:56.520]  And Fauci has stated that he's not gonna focus
[2:26:56.520 --> 2:27:00.760]  on a amicron vax, they're full court pressing these booths
[2:27:00.760 --> 2:27:04.320]  and people are lining up from everywhere.
[2:27:04.320 --> 2:27:08.160]  And I'm out East, but I just kind of take a survey
[2:27:08.160 --> 2:27:10.680]  of everywhere around the country.
[2:27:10.680 --> 2:27:15.680]  And it's beyond distressing how brainwashed these people are.
[2:27:15.680 --> 2:27:17.600]  And I really think that what Dr. Merritt
[2:27:17.600 --> 2:27:19.520]  was talking about yesterday,
[2:27:19.520 --> 2:27:24.520]  that even more serious than this spike protein virus
[2:27:24.560 --> 2:27:27.560]  is the level and the degree of how people
[2:27:27.560 --> 2:27:30.280]  on every socio-anomic background,
[2:27:30.280 --> 2:27:33.800]  education background, age, wherever they are,
[2:27:33.800 --> 2:27:36.840]  they are so brainwashed, Alex.
[2:27:36.840 --> 2:27:39.440]  I mean, it's beyond the pale.
[2:27:39.440 --> 2:27:41.520]  You're totally right, you're totally right.
[2:27:41.520 --> 2:27:45.960]  It's like a sick IQ test, like the last caller said.
[2:27:45.960 --> 2:27:49.960]  And the fallout, something is happening like this week.
[2:27:49.960 --> 2:27:51.160]  I was just reading right now,
[2:27:51.160 --> 2:27:54.600]  they're saying Cornell University has gone ahead
[2:27:54.600 --> 2:27:57.720]  and decided to go remote because they've had
[2:27:57.720 --> 2:28:01.560]  over 900 COVID cases this week.
[2:28:01.560 --> 2:28:03.240]  The VP for the university said-
[2:28:03.240 --> 2:28:04.760]  Despite the fact I've got the article,
[2:28:04.760 --> 2:28:07.840]  they're 96% vaccinated, but they've got to close down.
[2:28:07.840 --> 2:28:10.800]  It's all a fraud, it's meant to collapse society,
[2:28:10.800 --> 2:28:13.160]  and everyone's buying into it like it's for their safety
[2:28:13.160 --> 2:28:16.680]  when no, it's a post-industrial great reset plan.
[2:28:16.680 --> 2:28:20.760]  I think that people though that are working remotely
[2:28:20.760 --> 2:28:22.720]  in, you know, away from their offices,
[2:28:22.720 --> 2:28:25.600]  I think there are a significant amount of people
[2:28:25.600 --> 2:28:27.360]  that are much thicker than they're letting on
[2:28:27.360 --> 2:28:30.120]  because they're staying inside and suffering in silence.
[2:28:30.120 --> 2:28:31.760]  And I know they're verbatim
[2:28:31.760 --> 2:28:34.360]  because somebody in my family works remote
[2:28:34.360 --> 2:28:39.360]  and they have to kind of cajole the people to talk to them.
[2:28:39.360 --> 2:28:41.160]  And once they start talking,
[2:28:41.160 --> 2:28:42.840]  they start disclosing these issues
[2:28:42.840 --> 2:28:44.080]  that they're having and all while-
[2:28:44.080 --> 2:28:47.200]  I have family who just died in nursing homes,
[2:28:47.200 --> 2:28:48.360]  no one comes to see them.
[2:28:48.360 --> 2:28:49.200]  You're absolutely right.
[2:28:49.200 --> 2:28:51.480]  This is a psychological warfare takeover.
[2:28:51.480 --> 2:28:53.640]  It's fifth generation warfare.
[2:28:53.640 --> 2:28:56.240]  Thank you so much for the call, Julie.
[2:28:56.240 --> 2:28:58.320]  If you're concerned about the power grid and-
[2:28:58.320 --> 2:29:00.840]  We have developed the research and the tools
[2:29:00.840 --> 2:29:03.200]  to stop this evil and to break free from it
[2:29:03.200 --> 2:29:04.920]  and then to help others break free from it.
[2:29:04.920 --> 2:29:07.520]  That's why we've launched Reset Wars.
[2:29:07.520 --> 2:29:09.400]  Once you simply accept that there is
[2:29:09.400 --> 2:29:11.600]  an incredibly evil group of people in the world
[2:29:11.600 --> 2:29:13.200]  that are attempting the great reset
[2:29:13.200 --> 2:29:15.920]  and want a one-world corporate government,
[2:29:15.920 --> 2:29:17.920]  then you can learn how to defeat them
[2:29:17.920 --> 2:29:20.440]  by learning their war game strategies
[2:29:20.440 --> 2:29:22.960]  and how to not play the game.
[2:29:22.960 --> 2:29:25.400]  After decades of intense research,
[2:29:26.280 --> 2:29:28.280]  our quest to discover the key
[2:29:28.280 --> 2:29:31.960]  to breaking the globalist bonds is now live.
[2:29:31.960 --> 2:29:34.800]  The Reset Wars have begun.
[2:29:34.800 --> 2:29:38.760]  Start your journey at resetwars.com today.
[2:29:38.760 --> 2:29:41.600]  Your programming are very subconscious in our psyche
[2:29:41.600 --> 2:29:45.520]  to create these false constructs that they then control.
[2:29:45.520 --> 2:29:47.200]  We're gonna lay out how that works.
[2:29:47.200 --> 2:29:50.080]  Your journey against tyranny and true empowerment begins
[2:29:50.080 --> 2:29:51.800]  at resetwars.com.
[2:29:51.800 --> 2:29:52.920]  Please join me there.
[2:29:58.280 --> 2:30:01.160]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[2:30:01.160 --> 2:30:03.520]  It's time to come to grips with the fact
[2:30:03.520 --> 2:30:05.520]  that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[2:30:05.520 --> 2:30:09.400]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government
[2:30:09.400 --> 2:30:11.480]  are stealing all of your data
[2:30:11.480 --> 2:30:13.320]  and creating a map and a database
[2:30:13.320 --> 2:30:15.160]  of where you go and what you do.
[2:30:15.160 --> 2:30:17.760]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover,
[2:30:17.760 --> 2:30:19.600]  they can shut you down.
[2:30:19.600 --> 2:30:22.800]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards,
[2:30:22.800 --> 2:30:25.280]  protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos,
[2:30:25.280 --> 2:30:28.520]  protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[2:30:28.520 --> 2:30:31.240]  That's why everybody should visit infowarstore.com.

[2:30:59.880 --> 2:31:01.800]  Patriot points for our new sale.
[2:31:01.800 --> 2:31:03.160]  After years of being off the shelves,
[2:31:03.160 --> 2:31:05.880]  we're bringing back one of the biggest fan-favorite formulas
[2:31:05.880 --> 2:31:09.000]  ever, and it's now been reformulated as even stronger.
[2:31:09.000 --> 2:31:11.360]  It's Ultimate Bone Broth Plus.
[2:31:11.360 --> 2:31:14.920]  It's got concentrated, high-quality chicken broth protein,
[2:31:14.920 --> 2:31:17.720]  turmeric root that's so amazing, chaga musher,
[2:31:17.720 --> 2:31:20.840]  beef pollen, goji berry, alfalfa,
[2:31:20.840 --> 2:31:24.080]  herb powder, and it's got added magnesium and potassium
[2:31:24.080 --> 2:31:24.960]  for electrolytes.
[2:31:24.960 --> 2:31:28.160]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder
[2:31:28.160 --> 2:31:31.520]  with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[2:31:31.520 --> 2:31:33.400]  It even tastes better than the last formula.
[2:31:33.400 --> 2:31:36.000]  And what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[2:31:36.000 --> 2:31:40.040]  And again, it has that cutting edge chicken broth protein,
[2:31:40.040 --> 2:31:43.440]  isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[2:31:43.440 --> 2:31:44.360]  You're going to love this.
[2:31:44.360 --> 2:31:45.440]  And what it does for your joints,
[2:31:45.440 --> 2:31:47.680]  what it does for your body, it does for your bones,
[2:31:47.680 --> 2:31:50.280]  it does for your bones, it does for your bones.
[2:31:50.280 --> 2:31:53.560]  It's simply amazing, and it helps find the info war.
[2:31:53.560 --> 2:31:55.720]  This is really the best bone broth out there,
[2:31:55.720 --> 2:31:58.720]  so get yours at infowarstore.com today.
[2:31:58.720 --> 2:32:01.960]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda
[2:32:01.960 --> 2:32:05.520]  and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals
[2:32:05.520 --> 2:32:06.400]  added to the food.
[2:32:06.400 --> 2:32:07.920]  It's all come out.
[2:32:07.920 --> 2:32:09.760]  And they're doing that not because we're weak,
[2:32:09.760 --> 2:32:12.360]  but because we're made the image of God, the creator,
[2:32:12.360 --> 2:32:14.680]  and we are powerful.
[2:32:14.680 --> 2:32:17.920]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[2:32:17.920 --> 2:32:20.160]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying
[2:32:20.160 --> 2:32:25.560]  that nobody knows who first came up with the boy, is it true?
[2:32:25.560 --> 2:32:28.240]  The propaganda would not be necessary
[2:32:28.240 --> 2:32:31.400]  if the situation was hopeless.
[2:32:31.400 --> 2:32:33.600]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies
[2:32:33.600 --> 2:32:36.160]  and all their evil and all their cultural death
[2:32:36.160 --> 2:32:40.000]  because they know we are strong.
[2:32:40.000 --> 2:32:42.840]  And they know in the end, they signed on to God of this world,
[2:32:42.840 --> 2:32:44.000]  who is a loser.
[2:32:44.000 --> 2:32:45.840]  And that's why it's so important that everybody
[2:32:45.840 --> 2:32:48.120]  keep info wars in the air now more than ever.
[2:32:48.120 --> 2:32:50.240]  Because even if you don't believe in God,
[2:32:50.240 --> 2:32:52.400]  what the globalists are manifesting and setting up
[2:32:52.400 --> 2:32:53.720]  is safe handling.
[2:32:53.720 --> 2:32:55.960]  And we are opposing the one world government
[2:32:55.960 --> 2:32:59.440]  and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[2:32:59.440 --> 2:33:04.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[2:33:04.000 --> 2:33:05.240]  it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:11.720 --> 2:33:14.360]  Info wars, tomorrow's news, today.
[2:33:14.360 --> 2:33:20.080]  So we're showing 1975, the fall of Stagon
[2:33:20.080 --> 2:33:21.960]  that I mentioned earlier.
[2:33:21.960 --> 2:33:24.560]  Helicopters coming and picking up,
[2:33:24.560 --> 2:33:29.160]  people trying to evacuate, including US personnel.
[2:33:29.160 --> 2:33:31.000]  And it's similar to what we just saw a few months ago
[2:33:31.000 --> 2:33:33.600]  in Afghanistan.
[2:33:33.600 --> 2:33:35.840]  Biden said he won't see images of helicopters on roofs.
[2:33:35.840 --> 2:33:38.400]  He saw exactly that.
[2:33:38.400 --> 2:33:41.320]  But the reason I raised that is I'm not
[2:33:41.320 --> 2:33:44.160]  some big powerful badass up here that's got all the answers.
[2:33:44.160 --> 2:33:46.920]  And I'm defeating the New World Order with you.
[2:33:46.920 --> 2:33:49.320]  And we're no, no, it's all God in charge.
[2:33:49.320 --> 2:33:51.960]  And I'm hanging on the helicopter skids
[2:33:51.960 --> 2:33:58.160]  trying to get past my sins just like you are.
[2:33:58.160 --> 2:34:01.280]  I'm a pathetic person.
[2:34:01.280 --> 2:34:03.280]  But I love God.
[2:34:03.280 --> 2:34:05.240]  And I've got that connection.
[2:34:05.240 --> 2:34:07.920]  And I'm hanging on to those skids.
[2:34:07.920 --> 2:34:10.360]  All the arrogant Klaus Schwab's, the Bill Gates'
[2:34:10.360 --> 2:34:11.960]  and the things they do to the children,
[2:34:11.960 --> 2:34:13.480]  everything they think they're getting away with,
[2:34:13.480 --> 2:34:14.720]  they're not getting away with any of it.
[2:34:14.720 --> 2:34:15.520]  They're going to fail.
[2:34:15.520 --> 2:34:17.840]  They're going to fall.
[2:34:17.840 --> 2:34:21.080]  But we break down the secrets of transcending their lies
[2:34:21.080 --> 2:34:23.840]  and how they're psychologically keeping us in presence
[2:34:23.840 --> 2:34:26.440]  in the new course that we just released a few days ago.
[2:34:26.440 --> 2:34:29.560]  Today's the last day to get 25% off at midnight tonight.
[2:34:29.560 --> 2:34:32.200]  Central time, 11.59.
[2:34:32.200 --> 2:34:33.680]  Resetwars.com.
[2:34:33.680 --> 2:34:36.280]  And your purchase also funds the whole operation.
[2:34:36.280 --> 2:34:39.160]  So all of you listening, I'm not going
[2:34:39.160 --> 2:34:41.640]  to say you have a responsibility because you got a free will here.
[2:34:41.640 --> 2:34:42.920]  But if you don't go get this course,
[2:34:42.920 --> 2:34:44.880]  if you don't watch it, if you don't share it,
[2:34:44.880 --> 2:34:46.280]  if you don't show your friends and family,
[2:34:46.280 --> 2:34:47.560]  what's the whole point?
[2:34:47.560 --> 2:34:48.960]  Because everything we do is real.
[2:34:48.960 --> 2:34:50.720]  I mean, I'm real, folks.
[2:34:50.720 --> 2:34:51.280]  People know that.
[2:34:51.280 --> 2:34:52.520]  This is not a game.
[2:34:52.520 --> 2:34:53.920]  It's not a joke.
[2:34:53.920 --> 2:34:56.800]  And it really is up to you whether you
[2:34:56.800 --> 2:34:58.200]  want to see us continue on air.
[2:34:58.200 --> 2:35:01.200]  Because this will fund us for months and months in the future
[2:35:01.200 --> 2:35:02.960]  if a lot of you sign up to become members.
[2:35:02.960 --> 2:35:04.680]  Plus, the info is incredible.
[2:35:04.680 --> 2:35:08.440]  Resetwars.com, sale ends tonight, 25% off.
[2:35:08.440 --> 2:35:09.360]  It's now available.
[2:35:09.360 --> 2:35:10.000]  Go sign up.
[2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:11.000]  You can watch it right now.
[2:35:11.000 --> 2:35:15.560]  Watch it in five minutes, resetwars.com.
[2:35:15.560 --> 2:35:17.640]  OK, let's go back to these amazing phone callers.
[2:35:17.640 --> 2:35:20.080]  Who's been pulling the longest?
[2:35:20.080 --> 2:35:22.640]  That would be Daniel in Arizona.
[2:35:22.640 --> 2:35:23.440]  Daniel, welcome.
[2:35:23.440 --> 2:35:26.520]  You're on the air.
[2:35:26.520 --> 2:35:27.020]  Thank you.
[2:35:27.020 --> 2:35:31.160]  I want to share a single point that will kill a lot of birds
[2:35:31.160 --> 2:35:32.760]  with one stone.
[2:35:32.760 --> 2:35:34.840]  That's regenerative agriculture.
[2:35:34.840 --> 2:35:36.960]  And it is related to government.
[2:35:36.960 --> 2:35:40.480]  It should be putting forth policy that creates independence
[2:35:40.480 --> 2:35:43.280]  and not dependence, because it's a transfer of power
[2:35:43.280 --> 2:35:47.520]  from the people to the government, which is tyranny.
[2:35:47.520 --> 2:35:52.240]  So regenerative agriculture would get the left on our side
[2:35:52.240 --> 2:35:56.040]  because it negates CO2 climate change
[2:35:56.040 --> 2:35:59.200]  because it sequester CO2 from the atmosphere by itself.
[2:35:59.200 --> 2:36:01.200]  No cows have to stop farting.
[2:36:01.200 --> 2:36:03.120]  No cars have to stop driving.
[2:36:03.120 --> 2:36:05.840]  And that would negate the need for the pen out the car.
[2:36:05.840 --> 2:36:08.440]  Well, it sounds like you know what you're talking about.
[2:36:08.440 --> 2:36:10.320]  Yeah, it negates the control grid.
[2:36:10.320 --> 2:36:13.800]  So what is the answer to get the left to not destroy themselves?
[2:36:13.800 --> 2:36:16.840]  How do we get them to not commit suicide?
[2:36:16.840 --> 2:36:19.040]  I'm saying regenerative agriculture.
[2:36:19.040 --> 2:36:21.600]  And if we instantiate that through law,
[2:36:21.600 --> 2:36:24.680]  we can criminalize people like GMO farmers who
[2:36:24.680 --> 2:36:27.520]  are destroying the soil, which the healthy soil does not
[2:36:27.520 --> 2:36:29.840]  sequester CO2 from the atmosphere.
[2:36:29.840 --> 2:36:32.240]  If everyone did regenerative agriculture,
[2:36:32.240 --> 2:36:36.880]  we would stabilize CO2 levels in five years,
[2:36:36.880 --> 2:36:38.840]  which means that everyone who's not
[2:36:38.840 --> 2:36:41.240]  using regenerative agriculture, which is all the GMO
[2:36:41.240 --> 2:36:43.320]  farmers who are spraying their soils with things
[2:36:43.320 --> 2:36:46.000]  that kill the biology in the soil,
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:47.000]  are contributing to this.
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:47.960]  No, no, I get what you're saying,
[2:36:47.960 --> 2:36:48.760]  and I've researched this.
[2:36:48.760 --> 2:36:49.520]  You're right.
[2:36:49.520 --> 2:36:52.480]  If we even take their idea that carbon dioxide at high levels
[2:36:52.480 --> 2:36:56.280]  is bad, there's ways to fix it, but they're not doing that.
[2:36:56.280 --> 2:36:58.520]  So explain what you're saying.
[2:36:58.520 --> 2:37:01.640]  Regenerative agriculture is very simple.
[2:37:01.640 --> 2:37:03.880]  It's just rebuilding the soil food web.
[2:37:03.880 --> 2:37:06.160]  The biology, the microbiology, the whole soil food web.
[2:37:06.160 --> 2:37:06.680]  Absolutely.
[2:37:06.680 --> 2:37:09.560]  The soil is supposed to be alive, or it goes away
[2:37:09.560 --> 2:37:10.040]  and dies.
[2:37:10.040 --> 2:37:11.800]  You get a desert.
[2:37:11.800 --> 2:37:16.160]  So you bring the life back to the soil.
[2:37:16.160 --> 2:37:17.640]  The soil takes care of itself.
[2:37:17.640 --> 2:37:20.640]  All the minerals are already in the sand, pebbles, and rocks.
[2:37:20.640 --> 2:37:22.240]  You don't need to put any minerals in there.
[2:37:22.240 --> 2:37:24.120]  You have an infinitive minerals.
[2:37:24.120 --> 2:37:27.040]  All you need is the soil to make it bioavailable for the plants.
[2:37:27.040 --> 2:37:28.560]  Now, everyone who's not doing that
[2:37:28.560 --> 2:37:31.320]  is contributing to what they call the death of the plant
[2:37:31.320 --> 2:37:32.480]  at the end of the world.
[2:37:32.480 --> 2:37:34.960]  And they should be attacked at the end of the world.
[2:37:34.960 --> 2:37:37.120]  Bill Gates wants to ban organic farming.
[2:37:37.120 --> 2:37:38.840]  So they want more chemical farming,
[2:37:38.840 --> 2:37:40.560]  more pesticides, which is sick.
[2:37:40.560 --> 2:37:42.360]  So they're the ones claiming that the guardians have
[2:37:42.360 --> 2:37:44.560]  research this year right when actually they're
[2:37:44.560 --> 2:37:46.160]  the ones killing the plant.
[2:37:46.160 --> 2:37:48.880]  They tax the coal power plants out of existence
[2:37:48.880 --> 2:37:50.360]  because they say they're going to end the world.
[2:37:50.360 --> 2:37:52.120]  OK, they're ending the world.
[2:37:52.120 --> 2:37:54.040]  They need to be taxed out of existence,
[2:37:54.040 --> 2:37:56.800]  which means we need to have organic farming all over the United
[2:37:56.800 --> 2:37:57.300]  States.
[2:37:57.300 --> 2:38:00.040]  Bill Gates cannot farm anything.
[2:38:00.040 --> 2:38:01.080]  So that takes you down.
[2:38:01.080 --> 2:38:01.580]  Exactly.
[2:38:01.580 --> 2:38:04.440]  For those that don't know, Bill Gates wants chemical farming.
[2:38:04.440 --> 2:38:05.920]  He wants to ban organic.
[2:38:05.920 --> 2:38:08.800]  He claims organic farming is bad.
[2:38:08.800 --> 2:38:10.360]  So that takes out GMO.
[2:38:10.360 --> 2:38:12.840]  It takes out the Panopticon of Surveillance Grid.
[2:38:12.840 --> 2:38:15.720]  It takes out CO2 taxation.
[2:38:15.720 --> 2:38:19.840]  It takes out the banning of cars and planes.
[2:38:19.840 --> 2:38:23.600]  It gives us all healthier food, happier planet,
[2:38:23.600 --> 2:38:25.160]  happier animals.
[2:38:25.160 --> 2:38:26.360]  I hear you, Daniel.
[2:38:26.360 --> 2:38:27.240]  Thank you so much.
[2:38:27.240 --> 2:38:28.280]  We love you.
[2:38:28.280 --> 2:38:30.160]  Kyle or Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[2:38:30.160 --> 2:38:32.160]  Go ahead, Kyle.
[2:38:32.160 --> 2:38:33.640]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[2:38:33.640 --> 2:38:35.160]  Yes, sir.
[2:38:35.160 --> 2:38:37.200]  So I wanted to share a story about my father.
[2:38:37.200 --> 2:38:39.520]  He actually passed about two or three years ago.
[2:38:39.520 --> 2:38:42.840]  And he was sick with cancer for six years.
[2:38:42.840 --> 2:38:46.320]  And as sad as it is, I can tell you
[2:38:46.320 --> 2:38:50.320]  that this last 18 months has made me extremely
[2:38:50.320 --> 2:38:51.880]  grateful that he went when he did.
[2:38:51.880 --> 2:38:53.560]  Because as quality of life, he was
[2:38:53.560 --> 2:38:56.160]  able to go on vacations with his family.
[2:38:56.160 --> 2:39:00.000]  And he was able to see his family and friends
[2:39:00.000 --> 2:39:02.360]  and pass around his family and friends.
[2:39:02.360 --> 2:39:03.840]  And where I'm going with this.
[2:39:03.840 --> 2:39:04.920]  Oh, my god, exactly.
[2:39:04.920 --> 2:39:07.480]  Locking people up where they can't see their families.
[2:39:07.480 --> 2:39:08.560]  And the governor of New York is still
[2:39:08.560 --> 2:39:10.200]  trying to block that, exactly.
[2:39:10.200 --> 2:39:11.880]  Cutting us off from our families.
[2:39:11.880 --> 2:39:14.200]  How satanic is that?
[2:39:14.200 --> 2:39:15.520]  It's absolutely satanic.
[2:39:15.520 --> 2:39:17.400]  And where I'm going with this is it
[2:39:17.400 --> 2:39:20.920]  will come full circle when the people who did not
[2:39:20.920 --> 2:39:24.680]  want to take these injections and felt forced
[2:39:24.680 --> 2:39:26.920]  to take these injections by their employers.
[2:39:26.920 --> 2:39:30.080]  There's a groundswell happening that maybe these employers are
[2:39:30.080 --> 2:39:31.440]  extremely out of touch.
[2:39:31.440 --> 2:39:36.280]  These giant Forbes companies, the top 300 or 500.
[2:39:36.280 --> 2:39:39.600]  Are you talking about the 90 day club?
[2:39:39.600 --> 2:39:40.840]  No, no.
[2:39:40.840 --> 2:39:43.440]  Well, the 90 day clubs, people that have the 90 days to live,
[2:39:43.440 --> 2:39:45.160]  the people that have been killed by these shots,
[2:39:45.160 --> 2:39:46.440]  what's going to happen when they figure it out
[2:39:46.440 --> 2:39:48.360]  and go after the people that made them take them?
[2:39:48.360 --> 2:39:49.800]  You thought about that?
[2:39:49.800 --> 2:39:51.880]  I believe that these corporations are only
[2:39:51.880 --> 2:39:54.640]  holding onto this mandate because they don't know what
[2:39:54.640 --> 2:39:56.840]  to do when they repeal them.
[2:39:56.840 --> 2:39:58.760]  And these people who only took them
[2:39:58.760 --> 2:40:02.280]  to keep their livelihoods are going to sue the hell out
[2:40:02.280 --> 2:40:02.780]  of them.
[2:40:02.780 --> 2:40:04.360]  No, I agree, but let me ask this question.
[2:40:04.360 --> 2:40:07.160]  Why would the globalist want something so destructive?
[2:40:07.160 --> 2:40:10.720]  How do they think they're getting away with it?
[2:40:10.720 --> 2:40:13.120]  I think they might know something that we don't know.
[2:40:13.120 --> 2:40:15.160]  And that goes back to way back in the day,
[2:40:15.160 --> 2:40:17.560]  you were talking about Cuomo out in New York.
[2:40:17.560 --> 2:40:18.800]  Why is he so confident?
[2:40:18.800 --> 2:40:20.320]  What does he know that he doesn't know?
[2:40:20.320 --> 2:40:23.560]  But you know what, Alex, what gives me hope is he went down.
[2:40:23.560 --> 2:40:25.360]  People woke up to him.
[2:40:25.360 --> 2:40:26.720]  Maybe they put someone in a report.
[2:40:26.720 --> 2:40:28.880]  These evil people have a confidence act.
[2:40:28.880 --> 2:40:29.960]  That's all they've got.
[2:40:29.960 --> 2:40:32.360]  The truth is, they're like every other evil group.
[2:40:32.360 --> 2:40:33.600]  They're about to destroy themselves.
[2:40:33.600 --> 2:40:34.840]  We're going to win, brother.
[2:40:34.840 --> 2:40:37.640]  We just have to protect the children and stop being cowards.
[2:40:37.640 --> 2:40:38.280]  Absolutely.
[2:40:38.280 --> 2:40:39.840]  I appreciate you taking my call, but I really
[2:40:39.840 --> 2:40:41.720]  believe there's a groundswell that's happening.
[2:40:41.720 --> 2:40:44.240]  And not only the big corporations, these globalists,
[2:40:44.240 --> 2:40:47.200]  everybody who's against it, it's not a threat.
[2:40:47.200 --> 2:40:48.800]  It's kind of a promise, but just wait
[2:40:48.800 --> 2:40:50.440]  because the people are waking up.
[2:40:50.440 --> 2:40:51.120]  God bless you.
[2:40:51.120 --> 2:40:52.680]  Thank you so much, Kyle.
[2:40:52.680 --> 2:40:57.160]  Brad in Fort Worth, Texas, Brad, go ahead.
[2:40:57.160 --> 2:41:01.000]  As a fellow tiger, 47-year-old born in 1974,
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:02.960]  I wanted to say, God bless you, brother.
[2:41:02.960 --> 2:41:03.840]  God bless you, Brad.
[2:41:03.840 --> 2:41:05.160]  What's going on?
[2:41:05.160 --> 2:41:08.400]  With your permission, I'd like to cover three small items.
[2:41:08.400 --> 2:41:10.360]  I have a piece of new information for you.
[2:41:10.360 --> 2:41:13.080]  I have a question for you, and I have a favor
[2:41:13.080 --> 2:41:17.120]  to ask, which will include a plug for you, sir.
[2:41:17.120 --> 2:41:17.920]  Well, that's good, Brad.
[2:41:17.920 --> 2:41:19.480]  Let's start rolling.
[2:41:19.480 --> 2:41:23.240]  So first and foremost, a piece of new information.
[2:41:23.240 --> 2:41:25.200]  Police departments across the country
[2:41:25.200 --> 2:41:30.080]  are now establishing what they call a lock box program.
[2:41:30.080 --> 2:41:33.120]  I've just sent your staff a note from here
[2:41:33.120 --> 2:41:34.400]  in the Fort Worth area.
[2:41:34.400 --> 2:41:37.840]  We have a First Alliance Response Group
[2:41:37.840 --> 2:41:41.400]  that was started to gather police officers,
[2:41:41.400 --> 2:41:44.080]  current and former first responders,
[2:41:44.080 --> 2:41:46.960]  as well as current and former military members.
[2:41:46.960 --> 2:41:49.960]  And one of our members made us aware
[2:41:49.960 --> 2:41:53.760]  that they are sending out fliers to individuals
[2:41:53.760 --> 2:41:56.880]  that live by themselves over the age of 65,
[2:41:56.880 --> 2:41:59.920]  or that have health issues that live alone
[2:41:59.920 --> 2:42:01.560]  so that they can set up a lock box
[2:42:01.560 --> 2:42:04.000]  to gain access to their house at any point in time.
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:05.880]  And I find that very unnerving.
[2:42:05.880 --> 2:42:07.800]  Oh yeah, brother, this is the medical tyranny.
[2:42:07.800 --> 2:42:08.840]  Keep telling us about it.
[2:42:08.840 --> 2:42:11.600]  We've got it on screen right now, the lock box program.
[2:42:11.600 --> 2:42:14.560]  Yep, and from what my sources say,
[2:42:14.560 --> 2:42:16.360]  and what's rumored as people have been joking,
[2:42:16.360 --> 2:42:18.800]  well, we can also utilize that program
[2:42:18.800 --> 2:42:22.160]  to force vaccinate people who refuse to get the shot.
[2:42:22.160 --> 2:42:23.520]  Well, that's already started in Europe,
[2:42:23.520 --> 2:42:25.760]  another area, stay there, Brad, from Fort Worth.
[2:42:25.760 --> 2:42:27.400]  We'll finish up with you, don't hang up.
[2:42:27.400 --> 2:42:30.200]  And then we'll talk to John in Tennessee,
[2:42:30.200 --> 2:42:32.320]  and then Wendy, Laura, and Lee.
[2:42:32.320 --> 2:42:33.880]  And then we're gonna end this transmission
[2:42:33.880 --> 2:42:35.080]  with Alex Jones.
[2:42:35.080 --> 2:42:38.640]  And the great Cup Destroyer,
[2:42:38.640 --> 2:42:41.800]  O of the Destroyer will take over in the fourth hour
[2:42:41.800 --> 2:42:45.400]  ahead of three hours of the war rooms today.
[2:42:45.400 --> 2:42:47.200]  But I can't stress it with the listeners.
[2:42:47.200 --> 2:42:49.080]  We don't sell BS, we need your support,
[2:42:49.080 --> 2:42:51.040]  plus it's great information.

[2:43:58.200 --> 2:44:00.840]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep
[2:44:00.840 --> 2:44:02.560]  is the cornerstone of good health.
[2:44:02.560 --> 2:44:04.680]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule
[2:44:04.680 --> 2:44:06.720]  is linked with numerous health problems,
[2:44:06.720 --> 2:44:10.120]  including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes,
[2:44:10.120 --> 2:44:13.160]  poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.
[2:44:13.160 --> 2:44:15.640]  Introducing RocketRest, the new product
[2:44:15.640 --> 2:44:19.400]  from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at infowarsstore.com.

[2:44:25.520 --> 2:44:27.920]  but help you wake up feeling refreshed.
[2:44:27.920 --> 2:44:29.880]  Many competitors' sleep formulas
[2:44:29.880 --> 2:44:31.800]  focus only on getting you to sleep,
[2:44:31.800 --> 2:44:34.320]  but RocketRest was specifically formulated
[2:44:34.320 --> 2:44:38.000]  to help you feel rested and ready to take on the next day.
[2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:40.920]  It uses a unique quick release capsule system

[2:44:49.000 --> 2:44:50.520]  and wake up feeling rested.
[2:44:50.520 --> 2:44:52.520]  So get the new RocketRest formula
[2:44:52.520 --> 2:44:56.320]  from Dr. Jones Naturals right now at infowarsstore.com,
[2:44:56.320 --> 2:44:58.320]  so you're ready to take off.
[2:44:58.320 --> 2:45:02.760]  I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball games,
[2:45:02.760 --> 2:45:05.480]  I like going to concerts, I like going to play golf,
[2:45:05.480 --> 2:45:06.880]  I like going out to dinner.
[2:45:06.880 --> 2:45:08.920]  I like the metropolitan life.
[2:45:08.920 --> 2:45:11.280]  I like everything that comes with this.
[2:45:11.280 --> 2:45:14.240]  But see, I have the survival instinct
[2:45:14.240 --> 2:45:17.320]  that is to get the hell out of Democrat-run cities,
[2:45:17.320 --> 2:45:20.080]  get the hell out of major metropolitan areas,
[2:45:20.080 --> 2:45:21.840]  because unless we change course soon,
[2:45:21.840 --> 2:45:23.560]  it's all crashing down.
[2:45:23.560 --> 2:45:25.440]  Is it time to just move out to the woods,
[2:45:25.440 --> 2:45:27.520]  just time to go get a piece of property in the woods,
[2:45:27.520 --> 2:45:29.960]  just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies,
[2:45:29.960 --> 2:45:31.040]  just live off the land?
[2:45:31.040 --> 2:45:32.440]  That's the survival instinct.
[2:45:32.440 --> 2:45:34.000]  But see, the worldly part of me
[2:45:34.000 --> 2:45:35.760]  that's still probably the majority part of me,
[2:45:35.760 --> 2:45:38.240]  says, no, no, no, no, no, stay in the city.
[2:45:38.240 --> 2:45:40.800]  The survival instinct says, get the hell out of anywhere
[2:45:40.800 --> 2:45:43.240]  there's ever notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[2:45:43.240 --> 2:45:46.520]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is,
[2:45:46.520 --> 2:45:49.720]  a lot of you in the audience are facing as well.
[2:45:49.720 --> 2:45:52.280]  But you can at least have some comfort
[2:45:52.280 --> 2:45:54.440]  if you have the emergency food supplies,
[2:45:54.440 --> 2:45:56.920]  and so we have the best ones at infowarsstore.com.
[2:45:56.920 --> 2:45:58.760]  Infowars!
[2:45:58.760 --> 2:46:00.040]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[2:46:00.040 --> 2:46:02.040]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[2:46:02.040 --> 2:46:03.200]  Welcome. Hello, Alex.
[2:46:03.200 --> 2:46:04.040]  Yes, Malcolm.
[2:46:04.040 --> 2:46:06.160]  I will make this quick and real short
[2:46:06.160 --> 2:46:08.120]  where the other patrons can get on the line.
[2:46:08.120 --> 2:46:10.240]  Alex, I have to promote one thing
[2:46:10.240 --> 2:46:12.560]  from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer.
[2:46:12.560 --> 2:46:15.560]  Supermell Vitality and Brain Force Plus.
[2:46:15.560 --> 2:46:16.880]  Mix those two together.
[2:46:16.880 --> 2:46:18.440]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[2:46:18.440 --> 2:46:20.280]  Supermell Vitality really, really works.
[2:46:20.280 --> 2:46:23.480]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[2:46:23.480 --> 2:46:25.120]  that have never been heated up.
[2:46:25.120 --> 2:46:29.680]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[2:46:29.680 --> 2:46:32.000]  It also worked quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:33.760]  This is like a very fine wine.
[2:46:33.760 --> 2:46:35.880]  In fact, each batch is different.
[2:46:35.880 --> 2:46:38.360]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[2:46:38.360 --> 2:46:39.720]  People are like, why are you selling something
[2:46:39.720 --> 2:46:41.640]  and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[2:46:41.640 --> 2:46:44.120]  That's just how it is. It's how it works.
[2:46:44.120 --> 2:46:45.840]  So it's always good.
[2:46:45.840 --> 2:46:47.960]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[2:46:47.960 --> 2:46:51.000]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price,
[2:46:51.000 --> 2:46:52.040]  then this is it.
[2:46:52.040 --> 2:47:17.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this live Wednesday,
[2:47:17.200 --> 2:47:20.600]  December 15th, worldwide transmission.
[2:47:20.600 --> 2:47:23.560]  So again, the police on average are not our enemies,
[2:47:23.560 --> 2:47:27.360]  like George Soros and the Democratic Party want them to be.
[2:47:27.360 --> 2:47:30.320]  They're just a part of the constabulary in our government.
[2:47:30.320 --> 2:47:32.480]  But if the system can bully them into submission
[2:47:32.480 --> 2:47:33.920]  and get them to follow orders,
[2:47:33.920 --> 2:47:36.680]  they will become like North Korean police, the enemy.
[2:47:38.440 --> 2:47:40.360]  So there's a battle over police.
[2:47:40.360 --> 2:47:43.880]  Christians, conservatives, libertarians, Americans.
[2:47:43.880 --> 2:47:45.360]  We leave the police alone.
[2:47:45.360 --> 2:47:46.920]  We're going to work, we're going to the grocery store,
[2:47:46.920 --> 2:47:48.960]  we're going to church, we're going hiking.
[2:47:48.960 --> 2:47:50.640]  You know, we're going to play pool.
[2:47:50.640 --> 2:47:52.320]  We're going, we're not doing anything wrong.
[2:47:52.320 --> 2:47:53.440]  We see a cop. We're not worried.
[2:47:53.440 --> 2:47:57.400]  Hey, but once they become a political officer
[2:47:57.400 --> 2:47:59.560]  of the new old order, they become a problem.
[2:48:00.920 --> 2:48:02.240]  And that's where all these purges
[2:48:02.240 --> 2:48:03.440]  and all these vaccine mandates
[2:48:03.440 --> 2:48:05.840]  to the military and police and medical workers
[2:48:05.840 --> 2:48:08.080]  and firefighters and school teachers.
[2:48:08.080 --> 2:48:09.880]  This is about them purging.
[2:48:09.880 --> 2:48:11.440]  It's very simple.
[2:48:11.440 --> 2:48:13.960]  How does the communist purge government
[2:48:13.960 --> 2:48:16.240]  without actually taking over and killing people?
[2:48:16.240 --> 2:48:17.600]  Because they know we'd rise up and stop them.
[2:48:17.600 --> 2:48:20.000]  They do it through the vaccine as that pretext.
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:22.320]  And they brag all over the world.
[2:48:22.320 --> 2:48:24.120]  This is just the beginning of them
[2:48:24.120 --> 2:48:25.600]  getting their people in place.
[2:48:27.840 --> 2:48:29.080]  So how do you respond to that?
[2:48:29.080 --> 2:48:30.280]  You go to your city council,
[2:48:30.280 --> 2:48:31.320]  you go to your county commensurer,
[2:48:31.320 --> 2:48:32.320]  you go to your school boards,
[2:48:32.320 --> 2:48:33.760]  you go to your legislatures,
[2:48:33.760 --> 2:48:35.440]  you go to Congress peacefully,
[2:48:36.400 --> 2:48:38.440]  and you lay out the reality of what's happening
[2:48:38.440 --> 2:48:39.880]  and you say no to the system.
[2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:44.840]  And then the whole thing falls apart.
[2:48:44.840 --> 2:48:46.240]  That's why they wanted to send the FBI.
[2:48:46.240 --> 2:48:49.360]  Well, parents don't like critical race theory being taught
[2:48:49.360 --> 2:48:51.280]  and drag queen pedophile time taught.
[2:48:51.280 --> 2:48:54.560]  Just send the FBI to land a helicopter at the school
[2:48:54.560 --> 2:48:57.360]  in Virginia, that'll scare them.
[2:48:57.360 --> 2:48:58.400]  Did it scare the parents?
[2:48:58.400 --> 2:49:00.400]  No, they took over, they won the election.
[2:49:00.400 --> 2:49:01.480]  It didn't intimidate them.
[2:49:04.640 --> 2:49:05.560]  So that's where we are.
[2:49:05.560 --> 2:49:08.080]  We're not at war with the government, it's our government.
[2:49:08.080 --> 2:49:10.120]  It's been hijacked by criminals.
[2:49:10.120 --> 2:49:12.400]  We're at war with the people that have hijacked it
[2:49:12.400 --> 2:49:14.120]  and we're gonna take it back.
[2:49:14.120 --> 2:49:17.120]  And anybody serving the system who thinks
[2:49:17.120 --> 2:49:19.840]  they're gonna just sit on the sidelines as an idiot.
[2:49:19.840 --> 2:49:22.160]  You either join evil or you join good.
[2:49:22.160 --> 2:49:23.200]  There isn't some choice.
[2:49:23.200 --> 2:49:26.040]  You're either with America or you're with the pedophiles.
[2:49:27.320 --> 2:49:29.960]  My goodness, the official Homeland Security reports
[2:49:29.960 --> 2:49:30.800]  are the number one enemies,
[2:49:30.800 --> 2:49:33.560]  people questioning COVID measures
[2:49:33.560 --> 2:49:36.920]  or election fraud or open borders or all the rest of it.
[2:49:36.920 --> 2:49:38.400]  So let's go to your phone calls right now.
[2:49:38.400 --> 2:49:40.800]  Brad and Fort Worth, you're making a great point about,
[2:49:40.800 --> 2:49:42.040]  yes, that's actually in the news,
[2:49:42.040 --> 2:49:43.640]  what you mentioned, we pulled it up.
[2:49:43.640 --> 2:49:45.960]  The police are being trained to go quote check on people.
[2:49:45.960 --> 2:49:49.480]  Sounds reasonable, except it's a whole takeover system
[2:49:49.480 --> 2:49:51.600]  run by the UN and we have all the documents.
[2:49:51.600 --> 2:49:53.240]  Go ahead.
[2:49:53.240 --> 2:49:54.560]  No, you're absolutely correct.
[2:49:54.560 --> 2:49:56.880]  And I just find this very disturbing.
[2:49:56.880 --> 2:50:00.640]  I think it preys upon individuals who are older
[2:50:00.640 --> 2:50:04.200]  or that do not have solid family circles
[2:50:04.200 --> 2:50:07.120]  and giving the police access to your house.
[2:50:07.120 --> 2:50:10.920]  24-7-365 is just unreal to me.
[2:50:11.780 --> 2:50:13.120]  They may be doing it because they believe
[2:50:13.120 --> 2:50:15.320]  it's a good idea, it may be for what they call
[2:50:15.320 --> 2:50:16.160]  the greater good.
[2:50:16.160 --> 2:50:19.040]  Oh no, it sets the precedent that there's no Fourth Amendment
[2:50:19.040 --> 2:50:21.360]  and the state was wanting the police soon
[2:50:21.360 --> 2:50:24.600]  that Obama's domestic security force
[2:50:24.600 --> 2:50:26.920]  that's just as big and just as strong as our military
[2:50:26.920 --> 2:50:29.040]  has access into your house.
[2:50:29.040 --> 2:50:31.600]  Bingo, and since they have 60,000 dark troops
[2:50:31.600 --> 2:50:36.520]  throughout the U.S. that are funded by Obama's programs,
[2:50:36.520 --> 2:50:38.160]  I would be very nervous about that.
[2:50:38.160 --> 2:50:39.520]  Yeah, they're gonna stampede us
[2:50:39.520 --> 2:50:42.200]  with the next viral release, I totally agree.
[2:50:42.200 --> 2:50:44.760]  Absolutely, so the favor I'd like to ask you,
[2:50:44.760 --> 2:50:45.920]  and I wanna preface this with,
[2:50:45.920 --> 2:50:48.400]  I've been taking DNA force.
[2:50:48.400 --> 2:50:50.960]  Bezobeat, I think is one of your,
[2:50:50.960 --> 2:50:54.520]  outside of the turmeric may be one of your best supplements.
[2:50:54.520 --> 2:50:58.160]  I had high blood pressure before being awakened by you.
[2:50:58.160 --> 2:51:03.000]  I had, I've lost 34 pounds in the last six months.
[2:51:03.000 --> 2:51:05.200]  And I'd like the favor to ask with you
[2:51:05.200 --> 2:51:06.720]  and the reason I told you about that
[2:51:06.720 --> 2:51:10.240]  is I'd like you to make a commitment to your audience
[2:51:10.240 --> 2:51:12.400]  and to your family to lose 30 pounds
[2:51:12.400 --> 2:51:15.640]  only because we love you, Mint, and we need you around,
[2:51:15.640 --> 2:51:16.480]  and if you lose 30-
[2:51:16.480 --> 2:51:19.200]  No, I hear you, listen, I already lost 30 pounds plus
[2:51:19.200 --> 2:51:20.160]  in the last six months,
[2:51:20.160 --> 2:51:22.720]  but I need to lose another 30 pounds in your damn right.
[2:51:22.720 --> 2:51:24.040]  I just don't know if I can stay up here
[2:51:24.040 --> 2:51:26.040]  until 10 o'clock at nine tonight if I do that.
[2:51:26.040 --> 2:51:28.120]  I mean, hell, I'd love to go hike or go for a jog
[2:51:28.120 --> 2:51:29.400]  or go lift weights again.
[2:51:29.400 --> 2:51:32.120]  I already went for a hike this morning with my son,
[2:51:32.120 --> 2:51:35.960]  but I would love to do exactly what you're saying, brother,
[2:51:35.960 --> 2:51:38.640]  and you've got my promise to do it, thank you, Brad.
[2:51:38.640 --> 2:51:39.960]  All right, thank you, Brad.
[2:51:39.960 --> 2:51:42.040]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Tennessee.
[2:51:42.040 --> 2:51:43.640]  John and Tennessee are on here.
[2:51:45.160 --> 2:51:46.000]  Hey, Alex.
[2:51:46.000 --> 2:51:46.840]  Welcome.
[2:51:48.080 --> 2:51:50.480]  I just wanted to share with you, first of all,
[2:51:50.480 --> 2:51:54.360]  I'm just a simple human being proclaiming Jesus as Lord.
[2:51:54.360 --> 2:51:55.400]  I am not perfect.
[2:51:55.400 --> 2:51:58.400]  I'm just asking for some progress in that department,
[2:51:59.720 --> 2:52:02.200]  but I wanted to share with you some experience
[2:52:02.200 --> 2:52:05.520]  that I've had recently with some physicians and my wife.
[2:52:06.480 --> 2:52:09.640]  She suffers with a degenerative disease
[2:52:09.640 --> 2:52:13.240]  and I believe that that's courageous for her to suffer
[2:52:13.240 --> 2:52:18.240]  without handing over control of her body to this world,
[2:52:19.040 --> 2:52:21.240]  you know, to all the medicines that are trying
[2:52:21.240 --> 2:52:22.600]  to push upon her.
[2:52:22.600 --> 2:52:25.320]  And she's being gas lit by these doctors.
[2:52:25.320 --> 2:52:26.160]  Some of the things that they-
[2:52:26.160 --> 2:52:27.000]  Well, I want to be clear.
[2:52:27.000 --> 2:52:29.520]  I'm not a doctor and a lot of stuff they have is great.
[2:52:29.520 --> 2:52:31.600]  It's when big farmers making you take something,
[2:52:31.600 --> 2:52:33.120]  you better have a question about it.
[2:52:33.120 --> 2:52:34.440]  So, I mean, there's a lot of things
[2:52:34.440 --> 2:52:36.960]  the medical system have that are great for problems.
[2:52:36.960 --> 2:52:38.520]  It's just that the globalists see that
[2:52:38.520 --> 2:52:41.640]  as their best avenue of control, so they're taking it over.
[2:52:41.640 --> 2:52:43.480]  But I mean, I couldn't from afar
[2:52:43.480 --> 2:52:44.760]  give you my view about you and your wife.
[2:52:44.760 --> 2:52:46.600]  What do you think is going on?
[2:52:46.600 --> 2:52:51.080]  Just some of these gas lighting should be a question.
[2:52:51.080 --> 2:52:52.760]  There should be a simple response.
[2:52:52.760 --> 2:52:56.360]  For instance, just to trust God to take this shot,
[2:52:56.360 --> 2:53:00.120]  that's not him should be the response in your mind.
[2:53:00.120 --> 2:53:01.040]  That's not God.
[2:53:01.040 --> 2:53:05.320]  You cannot place God upon this shot.
[2:53:05.320 --> 2:53:07.320]  You can't prove that anyway.
[2:53:07.320 --> 2:53:08.760]  It's all patented information.
[2:53:08.760 --> 2:53:10.320]  You're not even going to be able to claim
[2:53:10.320 --> 2:53:13.080]  that this is natural ever.
[2:53:13.080 --> 2:53:14.640]  That can't be proven.
[2:53:14.640 --> 2:53:18.200]  So, you cannot, you can't take ownership away
[2:53:18.200 --> 2:53:20.320]  from God's creation.
[2:53:20.320 --> 2:53:21.640]  You can't do that.
[2:53:21.640 --> 2:53:23.880]  Well, that's what this whole genetic takeover is.
[2:53:23.880 --> 2:53:26.600]  This is a genetic takeover of our bodies.
[2:53:26.600 --> 2:53:27.440]  Thank you, John.
[2:53:27.440 --> 2:53:28.280]  I appreciate your call.
[2:53:28.280 --> 2:53:29.120]  Really good points.
[2:53:29.120 --> 2:53:31.800]  We're going to grab everybody in before the sour ends.
[2:53:31.800 --> 2:53:34.120]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Ohio.
[2:53:34.120 --> 2:53:35.040]  Brian, go ahead.
[2:53:35.040 --> 2:53:37.920]  Oh, okay.
[2:53:37.920 --> 2:53:38.760]  Hey, Alex.
[2:53:40.320 --> 2:53:41.760]  I just wanted to talk to you.
[2:53:43.720 --> 2:53:44.560]  Can you hear me?
[2:53:44.560 --> 2:53:45.400]  I can, yes.
[2:53:46.240 --> 2:53:47.200]  Okay, sorry.
[2:53:47.200 --> 2:53:50.520]  I just wanted to talk to you about how at where I work,
[2:53:50.520 --> 2:53:52.240]  I work in an assisted living center.
[2:53:52.240 --> 2:53:53.080]  Yes, sir.
[2:53:53.080 --> 2:53:54.480]  It's a lot like a nursing home.
[2:53:54.480 --> 2:53:55.440]  And don't get me wrong.
[2:53:55.440 --> 2:53:56.280]  I'm not a nurse.
[2:53:56.280 --> 2:53:57.400]  I'm not a medical professional.
[2:53:57.400 --> 2:53:58.240]  I work in the kitchen.
[2:53:58.240 --> 2:53:59.400]  I'm a glorified busboy.
[2:53:59.400 --> 2:54:04.400]  But they're training the directors and the managers
[2:54:04.400 --> 2:54:07.520]  on basically how to do medication
[2:54:07.520 --> 2:54:09.680]  and basically training them to be nurses.
[2:54:09.680 --> 2:54:11.040]  And I'm pretty sure they're even trying
[2:54:11.040 --> 2:54:12.800]  to get them certified to be nurses.
[2:54:12.800 --> 2:54:15.760]  And these are mainly people who work in offices
[2:54:15.760 --> 2:54:18.200]  who mainly do a lot of the paperwork in the building.
[2:54:18.200 --> 2:54:21.000]  They're training them to do nursing
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:23.760]  because a lot of their nurses haven't gotten vaccinated
[2:54:23.760 --> 2:54:26.600]  and they're attempting to prepare
[2:54:26.600 --> 2:54:28.680]  for if the vaccines are mandated.
[2:54:28.680 --> 2:54:31.760]  They are preparing to let people go,
[2:54:31.760 --> 2:54:35.280]  to tell people to stay home or to fire people.
[2:54:35.280 --> 2:54:38.080]  And they're training the vaccinated staff
[2:54:38.080 --> 2:54:40.960]  and mainly the managers and the directors
[2:54:42.120 --> 2:54:43.320]  all just how to be nurses.
[2:54:43.320 --> 2:54:44.800]  And they're trying to get them certified.
[2:54:44.800 --> 2:54:47.040]  They're literally taking classes
[2:54:47.040 --> 2:54:48.600]  because they're preparing for it.
[2:54:48.600 --> 2:54:51.160]  And pretty soon I'm probably not gonna have a job
[2:54:51.160 --> 2:54:52.320]  because I'm not vaccinated.
[2:54:52.320 --> 2:54:54.080]  And I just work in the kitchen.
[2:54:54.080 --> 2:54:56.000]  I just give these people their food
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:54:58.480]  and I take care of them as best as I can.
[2:54:58.480 --> 2:55:01.040]  And that's huge news and what you're saying is true.
[2:55:01.040 --> 2:55:04.480]  They already have the untrained military in five states
[2:55:04.480 --> 2:55:07.480]  doing medical procedures because they fired the doctors
[2:55:07.480 --> 2:55:09.360]  and the nurses and the medical workers.
[2:55:09.360 --> 2:55:10.960]  And yeah, you're saying you're a nursing home
[2:55:10.960 --> 2:55:14.440]  or assisted living, which is like below that
[2:55:14.440 --> 2:55:15.920]  before people go to a full nursing home
[2:55:15.920 --> 2:55:18.520]  and then of course hospice is that whole spectrum.
[2:55:18.520 --> 2:55:19.800]  But you're absolutely right.
[2:55:19.800 --> 2:55:21.000]  That's what's going on.
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:23.160]  They're trying to get you to just sign over
[2:55:23.160 --> 2:55:25.800]  and do all this, but a lot of states are backing off
[2:55:25.800 --> 2:55:27.920]  because the courts have blocked the vaccine mandate.
[2:55:27.920 --> 2:55:30.160]  So as bad as America is,
[2:55:30.160 --> 2:55:32.640]  we still have a better bill of rights in constitution
[2:55:32.640 --> 2:55:34.680]  and we're not as bad as Europe or Australia
[2:55:34.680 --> 2:55:36.360]  or the UK or Canada.
[2:55:36.360 --> 2:55:39.360]  So it's just a crazy time to be alive, Brian.
[2:55:39.360 --> 2:55:43.000]  Yeah, and I just wanted to ask one question.
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:46.360]  How does somebody like me, like how do I get started?
[2:55:46.360 --> 2:55:48.200]  Like who do I talk to?
[2:55:48.200 --> 2:55:50.720]  Cause I feel like I need to speak up more because-
[2:55:50.720 --> 2:55:54.480]  Brother, I started out 28 years ago on Access TV.
[2:55:54.480 --> 2:55:56.640]  So just start a YouTube channel, start a Twitter,
[2:55:56.640 --> 2:55:59.320]  start a Facebook, go to events, shoot video of it,
[2:55:59.320 --> 2:56:00.340]  just begin.
[2:56:01.480 --> 2:56:03.480]  The enemy doesn't even know who you are.
[2:56:04.520 --> 2:56:06.800]  You'll build up a huge following before they ban you
[2:56:06.800 --> 2:56:08.240]  and then you use a rumble account
[2:56:08.240 --> 2:56:11.800]  or a band-op video account or other accounts
[2:56:11.800 --> 2:56:13.560]  to back up what you're doing
[2:56:13.560 --> 2:56:17.160]  while you use the enemy platforms to reach people.
[2:56:17.160 --> 2:56:19.440]  You go on like a guerrilla warrior in there,
[2:56:19.440 --> 2:56:20.760]  you get them on board
[2:56:20.760 --> 2:56:22.400]  and then knowing you're gonna get banned down the road.
[2:56:22.400 --> 2:56:24.360]  So God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[2:56:25.480 --> 2:56:26.320]  All right.
[2:56:26.320 --> 2:56:30.640]  Wendy in St. Louis, we're gonna come back,
[2:56:30.640 --> 2:56:33.480]  go to you next segment, then Laura Lee in Ontario
[2:56:34.400 --> 2:56:37.240]  and then Lee and then Jim.
[2:56:37.240 --> 2:56:40.200]  I'll get to those calls before I end my part
[2:56:40.200 --> 2:56:43.480]  of the transmission and then Owen Shroyer is coming in here.
[2:56:43.480 --> 2:56:46.120]  Now again, I'm all about solutions.
[2:56:46.120 --> 2:56:48.560]  I'm all about victory, I'm all about taking action.
[2:56:48.560 --> 2:56:51.640]  And I gotta tell you, I slow down, I lay it all out,
[2:56:51.640 --> 2:56:54.840]  I give you the deep info, I break down the MK Ultra documents
[2:56:54.840 --> 2:56:57.400]  and I re-engineer it, reverse-engineer it.
[2:56:57.400 --> 2:57:01.680]  Resetwars.com, resetwars.com.
[2:57:01.680 --> 2:57:04.280]  Right now is the last 12 hours or so
[2:57:04.280 --> 2:57:07.680]  at midnight tonight, Central, the 25% off deal stops.
[2:57:07.680 --> 2:57:09.440]  It'll still be a great deal where it's at
[2:57:09.440 --> 2:57:11.160]  and you're helping fund the Info War.
[2:57:11.160 --> 2:57:14.240]  It's a fraction of an NFL or George Strait ticket
[2:57:15.400 --> 2:57:18.200]  and it's there and it's building a whole infrastructure
[2:57:18.200 --> 2:57:21.880]  of us to do exclusive Prager University-style reports
[2:57:21.880 --> 2:57:23.480]  on every major subject, the way people love it.
[2:57:23.480 --> 2:57:25.000]  You wanna be a founding member
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:27.120]  and found the next level of Info War
[2:57:27.120 --> 2:57:28.920]  as we get ready to explode?
[2:57:28.920 --> 2:57:32.520]  Then go join today at resetwars.com.
[2:57:33.640 --> 2:57:36.480]  The course is now live, you can see it right now
[2:57:36.480 --> 2:57:39.080]  and it's 25% off before midnight tonight.
[2:57:39.080 --> 2:57:42.280]  Resetwars.com, please take action.
[2:57:42.280 --> 2:57:44.280]  This is the next level, we'll be right back.
[2:57:46.480 --> 2:57:47.800]  So this could be,
[2:57:49.640 --> 2:57:52.520]  this could be Info Wars last Christmas
[2:57:52.520 --> 2:57:55.200]  because it could be America's last Christmas.
[2:57:55.200 --> 2:57:57.320]  Evil is taking over the planet.
[2:57:57.320 --> 2:57:59.160]  They're destroying our borders, our sovereignty,
[2:57:59.160 --> 2:58:01.960]  our supply chains, our language, our currencies.
[2:58:01.960 --> 2:58:03.240]  They're coming after us.
[2:58:03.240 --> 2:58:05.960]  And if we don't support American businesses
[2:58:05.960 --> 2:58:07.920]  and if we don't support independent media
[2:58:07.920 --> 2:58:09.760]  in the final days of 2021,
[2:58:09.760 --> 2:58:12.720]  we have no future in the midterms in 2022.
[2:58:12.720 --> 2:58:17.400]  2022 is the year where America decides its fate.
[2:58:17.400 --> 2:58:19.240]  I wanna thank you all for your support.
[2:58:19.240 --> 2:58:21.240]  I wanna encourage you to your Christmas shopping
[2:58:21.240 --> 2:58:22.520]  at infowarstore.com
[2:58:22.520 --> 2:58:24.880]  because I can barely keep our operation going.
[2:58:24.880 --> 2:58:27.440]  And I appreciate you keeping us in the position
[2:58:27.440 --> 2:58:28.280]  to fight back.
[2:58:28.280 --> 2:58:29.520]  I am so thankful for you.
[2:58:29.520 --> 2:58:31.040]  And I'm asking you now to realize
[2:58:31.040 --> 2:58:33.160]  the huge investment you made over the years in us
[2:58:33.160 --> 2:58:35.960]  and I'll redouble your efforts to make sure
[2:58:35.960 --> 2:58:37.800]  that your investment and freedom continues on.
[2:58:37.800 --> 2:58:42.160]  Infowarstore.com has incredible products,
[2:58:42.160 --> 2:58:44.920]  store-wide free shipping up until December 20th.
[2:58:44.920 --> 2:58:47.200]  So please take action now and keep us on the air.
[2:58:47.200 --> 2:58:48.040]  Thank you.
[2:58:48.040 --> 2:58:49.320]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[2:58:49.320 --> 2:58:51.360]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[2:58:51.360 --> 2:58:52.200]  Welcome.
[2:58:52.200 --> 2:58:53.040]  Hello, Alex.
[2:58:53.040 --> 2:58:53.880]  Yes, Malcolm.
[2:58:53.880 --> 2:58:55.520]  All right, I will make this quick and real short
[2:58:55.520 --> 2:58:57.520]  where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[2:58:57.520 --> 2:58:59.600]  Alex, I have to promote one thing
[2:58:59.600 --> 2:59:01.920]  from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer.
[2:59:01.920 --> 2:59:04.920]  Supermail Vitality and Brainforce Plus.
[2:59:04.920 --> 2:59:06.280]  Mix those two together.
[2:59:06.280 --> 2:59:07.800]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[2:59:07.800 --> 2:59:09.640]  Supermail Vitality really, really works.
[2:59:09.640 --> 2:59:12.880]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[2:59:12.880 --> 2:59:14.480]  that have never been heated up.
[2:59:14.480 --> 2:59:19.080]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[2:59:19.080 --> 2:59:21.360]  They also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[2:59:21.360 --> 2:59:23.160]  This is like a very fine wine.
[2:59:23.160 --> 2:59:25.240]  It's, in fact, each batch is different.
[2:59:25.240 --> 2:59:27.760]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[2:59:27.760 --> 2:59:29.120]  People are like, why are you selling something
[2:59:29.120 --> 2:59:31.000]  and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[2:59:31.000 --> 2:59:31.920]  That's just how it is.
[2:59:31.920 --> 2:59:33.520]  It's how it works.
[2:59:33.520 --> 2:59:35.240]  So it's always good.
[2:59:35.240 --> 2:59:37.360]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[2:59:37.360 --> 2:59:40.400]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price,
[2:59:40.400 --> 2:59:49.320]  then this is it.
[2:59:49.320 --> 2:59:53.880]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[2:59:53.880 --> 2:59:55.080]  it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:01.280 --> 3:00:05.360]  I'm no stranger to the rain.
[3:00:05.360 --> 3:00:07.720]  Mr. Whitley bringing us in.
[3:00:07.720 --> 3:00:10.600]  Let's go to Wendy in St. Louis.
[3:00:10.600 --> 3:00:11.600]  Wendy, thanks for holding.
[3:00:11.600 --> 3:00:13.600]  Welcome.
[3:00:13.600 --> 3:00:16.800]  Hi, go ahead.
[3:00:16.800 --> 3:00:20.280]  I really appreciate everything you do for everyone
[3:00:20.280 --> 3:00:23.440]  to help the world because it really, really matters a lot
[3:00:23.440 --> 3:00:24.760]  and makes a difference.
[3:00:24.760 --> 3:00:28.400]  We are making a difference, all of us are.
[3:00:28.400 --> 3:00:31.760]  I'm calling about reset words, actually, which
[3:00:31.760 --> 3:00:34.160]  sounds really, really, really incredible.
[3:00:34.160 --> 3:00:39.120]  But I'm calling to ask, because you mentioned MK-ULTRA,
[3:00:39.120 --> 3:00:41.960]  the experiments that use frequent specifically
[3:00:41.960 --> 3:00:47.080]  to erase the mind and to reprogram people.
[3:00:47.080 --> 3:00:50.560]  And also, in light of that, the Cuba situation
[3:00:50.560 --> 3:00:53.520]  with the Cuba embassy and the workers that
[3:00:53.520 --> 3:00:58.080]  have legions in their brain and other bodily symptoms,
[3:00:58.080 --> 3:00:59.640]  basically frequently warfare.
[3:00:59.640 --> 3:01:03.800]  And the Havana syndrome.
[3:01:03.800 --> 3:01:08.480]  Yes, and so basically, in terms of remote frequency,
[3:01:08.480 --> 3:01:10.960]  warfare weapons being used.
[3:01:10.960 --> 3:01:14.040]  And in a way that it's also, I think,
[3:01:14.040 --> 3:01:15.680]  like artificial intelligence, how
[3:01:15.680 --> 3:01:20.560]  we're going to potentially connect our brains to a computer.
[3:01:20.560 --> 3:01:22.880]  I think that that's the way that, according to like,
[3:01:22.880 --> 3:01:25.800]  the mind has no firewall by Timothy Thomas.
[3:01:25.800 --> 3:01:26.520]  No, exactly.
[3:01:26.520 --> 3:01:28.400]  And that's what reset wars gets into,
[3:01:28.400 --> 3:01:30.560]  is becoming aware of what they're doing,
[3:01:30.560 --> 3:01:32.640]  gives you a lot of power over it.
[3:01:32.640 --> 3:01:35.120]  And so absolutely, yeah.
[3:01:35.120 --> 3:01:36.120]  So exactly.
[3:01:36.120 --> 3:01:38.960]  And so the question is, do you also
[3:01:38.960 --> 3:01:44.720]  recommend basically like a Faraday cage for people?
[3:01:44.720 --> 3:01:45.680]  Of course, it has to be.
[3:01:45.680 --> 3:01:47.480]  I personally have told my family,
[3:01:47.480 --> 3:01:49.360]  I want to move to the country.
[3:01:49.360 --> 3:01:50.560]  My oral offices are here.
[3:01:50.560 --> 3:01:52.440]  I don't have the money to move info wars.
[3:01:52.440 --> 3:01:54.240]  But I mean, we've got to get out of this.
[3:01:54.240 --> 3:01:55.480]  I mean, it's not natural.
[3:01:55.480 --> 3:01:56.440]  It's not healthy.
[3:01:56.440 --> 3:01:57.440]  We've got the documents.
[3:01:57.440 --> 3:01:58.960]  They're bombarding us all.
[3:01:58.960 --> 3:02:00.960]  And again, if you're consciously aware of it,
[3:02:00.960 --> 3:02:01.880]  it gives you some power.
[3:02:01.880 --> 3:02:03.760]  But at the end of the day, it's so dangerous.
[3:02:03.760 --> 3:02:05.800]  But absolutely, I mean, I think the whole future
[3:02:05.800 --> 3:02:08.280]  is not just putting our cell phones in a Faraday cage
[3:02:08.280 --> 3:02:09.920]  to control them and not to track us,
[3:02:09.920 --> 3:02:12.680]  but to put our lives in a Faraday cage.
[3:02:12.680 --> 3:02:14.640]  That's why the system makes fun of that and attacks it.
[3:02:14.640 --> 3:02:16.920]  But no, this is their covert war.
[3:02:16.920 --> 3:02:18.200]  It's their covert takeover.
[3:02:18.200 --> 3:02:20.800]  It's definitely happening, Wendy.
[3:02:20.800 --> 3:02:21.320]  Definitely.
[3:02:21.320 --> 3:02:23.680]  And I've actually used electromagnetic shielding
[3:02:23.680 --> 3:02:25.960]  to stop symptoms in myself and others.
[3:02:25.960 --> 3:02:29.680]  And I actually had a very powerful experience with COVID,
[3:02:29.680 --> 3:02:31.400]  which appeared just like COVID.
[3:02:31.400 --> 3:02:35.000]  The exact symptoms where I thought I was going to die.
[3:02:35.000 --> 3:02:37.560]  And I had built this little Faraday cage.
[3:02:37.560 --> 3:02:38.840]  It wasn't a perfect Faraday cage,
[3:02:38.840 --> 3:02:42.640]  but it had very thick metal shielding and other metal
[3:02:42.640 --> 3:02:46.080]  and shielding material that I could put around me.
[3:02:46.080 --> 3:02:48.080]  And I thought I was going to die.
[3:02:48.080 --> 3:02:52.680]  I crawled off the bed into this caged area that I created.
[3:02:52.680 --> 3:02:54.440]  I'd wrapped myself in this stuff.
[3:02:54.440 --> 3:02:58.000]  And immediately, my symptoms started to decline.
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:03:01.160]  Yeah, there's no doubt that I've had the former hop-top people
[3:03:01.160 --> 3:03:02.960]  with main capital and others on.
[3:03:02.960 --> 3:03:05.240]  They know war start and stock markets
[3:03:05.240 --> 3:03:07.600]  crash when there's big solar flares.
[3:03:07.600 --> 3:03:08.920]  And you're like, why is that?
[3:03:08.920 --> 3:03:12.040]  Because a big solar flare comes out and hits us with radiation.
[3:03:12.040 --> 3:03:14.240]  That's why police know there's triple the murders
[3:03:14.240 --> 3:03:15.680]  and killings in a full moon.
[3:03:15.680 --> 3:03:17.760]  It's not just because it's light outside.
[3:03:17.760 --> 3:03:19.400]  It does something.
[3:03:19.400 --> 3:03:23.480]  And the way the sun's energy hits it and bounces back.
[3:03:23.480 --> 3:03:26.880]  So there's a lot going on.
[3:03:26.880 --> 3:03:28.840]  And it's in all these documents we've got
[3:03:28.840 --> 3:03:30.160]  that the system is aware of it.
[3:03:30.160 --> 3:03:32.040]  And that's what Reset Wars deals with.
[3:03:32.040 --> 3:03:32.960]  Thank you so much, Wendy.
[3:03:32.960 --> 3:03:35.440]  I hope you become a member at resetwars.com.
[3:03:35.440 --> 3:03:36.720]  Again, it's going to fund us.
[3:03:36.720 --> 3:03:38.840]  If we were selling hot air, it'd be great.
[3:03:38.840 --> 3:03:41.120]  Because the input we covered, this is not hot air.
[3:03:41.120 --> 3:03:44.000]  This is hardcore, important information
[3:03:44.000 --> 3:03:46.040]  to really get ahold of your mind and think about it.
[3:03:46.040 --> 3:03:47.480]  But it's the gateway to it.
[3:03:47.480 --> 3:03:49.240]  But it's incredibly powerful.
[3:03:49.240 --> 3:03:51.080]  They don't want you to have this information.
[3:03:51.080 --> 3:03:56.280]  All right, Laura Lee, Leah, Jim, I know Owen Schreuer.
[3:03:56.280 --> 3:03:58.000]  He's going to take your calls.
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:03:59.560]  He'll be here in two minutes, taking
[3:03:59.560 --> 3:04:01.360]  over for the rest of the hour.
[3:04:01.360 --> 3:04:03.520]  And we also have an analysis I did of Reset Wars
[3:04:03.520 --> 3:04:05.360]  that people have really been asking for again.
[3:04:05.360 --> 3:04:08.720]  Part of that's going to air in this hour.
[3:04:08.720 --> 3:04:10.480]  But I want to thank the crew.
[3:04:10.480 --> 3:04:13.520]  Look, I'm just here battling to raise money to keep us on air.
[3:04:13.520 --> 3:04:14.880]  We sell great stuff to do it.
[3:04:14.880 --> 3:04:19.080]  But DNA force plus, environmental fusion,
[3:04:19.080 --> 3:04:22.720]  and these great self-help courses, all of it.
[3:04:22.720 --> 3:04:24.960]  And believe me, I don't want to sit here and beg you for help.
[3:04:24.960 --> 3:04:28.360]  But if you don't help us, we're going to implode shut down.
[3:04:28.360 --> 3:04:30.680]  It's like God's plan that we're always just barely on air,
[3:04:30.680 --> 3:04:33.280]  always barely able to keep going, grabbing huge effects
[3:04:33.280 --> 3:04:33.880]  while we do it.
[3:04:33.880 --> 3:04:36.800]  But we need you to celebrate Infowars.
[3:04:36.800 --> 3:04:38.400]  We need you to go to InfowarsTour.com
[3:04:38.400 --> 3:04:40.960]  and get your Christmas presents there.
[3:04:40.960 --> 3:04:43.960]  We've got shortwave radios as low as $16 a piece that
[3:04:43.960 --> 3:04:45.280]  really worked great.
[3:04:45.280 --> 3:04:46.840]  Those are some amazing deals.
[3:04:46.840 --> 3:04:49.680]  All right, we're going to break, and Owen Schreuer
[3:04:49.680 --> 3:04:55.960]  is taking over with Laura Lee, Lee, and Jim in a few minutes.
[3:04:55.960 --> 3:04:57.600]  Everything I do.
[3:04:57.600 --> 3:05:01.440]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years
[3:05:01.440 --> 3:05:02.360]  against the globalist.
[3:05:02.360 --> 3:05:04.440]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[3:05:04.440 --> 3:05:08.240]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks
[3:05:08.240 --> 3:05:10.000]  before they went operational.
[3:05:10.000 --> 3:05:11.080]  But we failed.
[3:05:11.080 --> 3:05:12.720]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[3:05:12.720 --> 3:05:14.600]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed.
[3:05:14.600 --> 3:05:18.360]  But they are going ahead with their full operational
[3:05:18.360 --> 3:05:20.600]  deindustrialization great reset.
[3:05:20.600 --> 3:05:22.520]  And that's why it's more important than ever
[3:05:22.520 --> 3:05:24.480]  that all viewers and all listeners
[3:05:24.480 --> 3:05:26.560]  tell everybody they know about the show,
[3:05:26.560 --> 3:05:28.080]  because people are ready to wake up
[3:05:28.080 --> 3:05:29.520]  and ready to hear the truth.
[3:05:29.520 --> 3:05:31.400]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy
[3:05:31.400 --> 3:05:32.840]  and trying to stop their agenda.
[3:05:32.840 --> 3:05:34.800]  We've also got to get personally prepared.
[3:05:34.800 --> 3:05:36.200]  And one of the number one things to do
[3:05:36.200 --> 3:05:37.640]  is high quality, storeable food.
[3:05:37.640 --> 3:05:39.200]  We've got the best food ready to ship
[3:05:39.200 --> 3:05:42.360]  at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[3:05:42.360 --> 3:05:45.040]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply
[3:05:45.040 --> 3:05:47.920]  or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[3:05:47.920 --> 3:05:50.760]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up
[3:05:50.760 --> 3:05:52.840]  and before there are long lines and waits.
[3:05:52.840 --> 3:05:55.200]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[3:05:55.200 --> 3:05:57.360]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[3:05:59.360 --> 3:06:03.080]  Mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[3:06:03.080 --> 3:06:06.360]  You want to stop tyranny, till so does he.
[3:06:06.360 --> 3:06:11.360]  Live from the infowar.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[3:06:11.360 --> 3:06:12.800]  Get your motor running.
[3:06:19.160 --> 3:06:22.400]  2022 is the year of the tiger.
[3:06:22.400 --> 3:06:25.680]  The Communist Chinese haven't thrown away
[3:06:25.680 --> 3:06:29.280]  all of the ancient mysticism and folklore of China.
[3:06:29.280 --> 3:06:32.120]  And they really go off of these archetypal years.
[3:06:32.120 --> 3:06:35.120]  And they believe the best years to launch a war
[3:06:35.120 --> 3:06:38.520]  or to launch a new endeavor are the dragon and the tiger.
[3:06:38.520 --> 3:06:40.120]  But the dragon and their lore can be seen
[3:06:40.120 --> 3:06:41.120]  as turning against you.
[3:06:41.120 --> 3:06:42.800]  And though it gives you great power in that year
[3:06:42.800 --> 3:06:46.320]  to launch a war, sometimes the dragon can be a trickster.
[3:06:46.320 --> 3:06:48.600]  But the tiger is never a trickster
[3:06:48.600 --> 3:06:51.600]  and is the second most powerful creature
[3:06:51.600 --> 3:06:53.560]  on the Chinese zodiac.
[3:06:53.560 --> 3:06:56.800]  And their leaders really believe in this stuff.
[3:06:56.800 --> 3:06:58.880]  Well, it just so happens that I'm year of the tiger
[3:06:58.880 --> 3:07:00.640]  next year as well, and that's my sign.
[3:07:00.640 --> 3:07:03.640]  So maybe there is something to it, but probably not.
[3:07:03.640 --> 3:07:06.080]  Regardless, in their minds there is.
[3:07:06.080 --> 3:07:08.280]  And it's all about what your mind believes.
[3:07:08.280 --> 3:07:11.440]  It's all about the confines we put over our minds
[3:07:11.440 --> 3:07:12.440]  that limit us.
[3:07:12.440 --> 3:07:14.800]  And so that's why superstitions like what year
[3:07:14.800 --> 3:07:17.520]  your zodiac are so important, even to world leaders.
[3:07:17.520 --> 3:07:19.000]  Hitler was obsessed with stuff like that.
[3:07:19.000 --> 3:07:21.760]  Napoleon, Julius Caesar, and so many others,
[3:07:21.760 --> 3:07:24.040]  because by believing in the stars,
[3:07:24.040 --> 3:07:25.920]  it allows them to actually believe in themselves.
[3:07:25.920 --> 3:07:28.720]  And this goes into the false constructs and mind control.
[3:07:28.720 --> 3:07:32.680]  So this is the year of the tiger, 2022 that we're going into.
[3:07:32.680 --> 3:07:35.920]  And I want everybody to get the latest information
[3:07:35.920 --> 3:07:36.920]  on how we're fighting back
[3:07:36.920 --> 3:07:38.520]  and how we're breaking our conditioning together
[3:07:38.520 --> 3:07:40.200]  at resetwars.com.
[3:07:40.200 --> 3:07:42.000]  ResetWars is now live.
[3:07:42.000 --> 3:07:43.640]  The course he is now available.
[3:07:43.640 --> 3:07:44.840]  Thousands of people have signed up.
[3:07:44.840 --> 3:07:46.520]  We're getting rave reviews back.
[3:07:46.520 --> 3:07:49.040]  And there's 25% off running right now
[3:07:49.040 --> 3:07:50.160]  for just a few more days.
[3:07:50.160 --> 3:07:53.600]  So we're about to leave 2021 and go to 2022,
[3:07:53.600 --> 3:07:56.200]  the year of the tiger, and resetwars.com.
[3:08:05.240 --> 3:08:06.480]  The world is changing.
[3:08:08.280 --> 3:08:11.200]  History is happening now.
[3:08:11.200 --> 3:08:14.640]  The Great Reset is a corporate assault on humanity.
[3:08:14.640 --> 3:08:18.360]  A total consolidation over every aspect of our lives.
[3:08:20.160 --> 3:08:23.280]  But we have the answer to respond to the Great Reset.
[3:08:23.280 --> 3:08:25.080]  It's called resetwars.
[3:08:25.080 --> 3:08:30.080]  And it is the combined knowledge of my 28 years on air,
[3:08:30.520 --> 3:08:32.960]  understanding how the new world order operates
[3:08:32.960 --> 3:08:34.520]  and how to stop them.
[3:08:34.520 --> 3:08:36.600]  Now is the time to be part of history.
[3:08:36.600 --> 3:08:39.040]  If you wait six months or a year to get involved,
[3:08:40.320 --> 3:08:42.560]  the situation's gonna be a lot worse than it is now.
[3:08:42.560 --> 3:08:46.120]  We have a narrow window to really take on the globalist
[3:08:46.120 --> 3:08:48.680]  during their attempt to take over the planet.
[3:08:48.680 --> 3:08:50.920]  They've launched their main offensive.
[3:08:50.920 --> 3:08:53.240]  Once they get their casual society tracker system
[3:08:53.240 --> 3:08:56.760]  in places can be very hard to get out from under their thumb.
[3:08:56.760 --> 3:08:58.960]  But humanity is waking up all over the world.
[3:08:58.960 --> 3:09:01.440]  And there are millions of people every day protesting
[3:09:01.440 --> 3:09:03.600]  against the COVID-19 UN takeover,
[3:09:03.600 --> 3:09:05.400]  which is again the main fear weapon
[3:09:05.400 --> 3:09:07.440]  of the Great Reset in their own words.
[3:09:07.440 --> 3:09:08.880]  Klaus Schwab, the head of the Davos Group
[3:09:08.880 --> 3:09:10.320]  who's launched this program,
[3:09:10.320 --> 3:09:12.480]  says that you will have to have a microchip under your skin
[3:09:12.480 --> 3:09:15.800]  to buy and sell soon as part of your vaccine passport.
[3:09:15.800 --> 3:09:18.680]  This isn't tyranny that's coming, it's here.
[3:09:18.680 --> 3:09:22.280]  And reset wars enables you to not let them demoralize you
[3:09:22.280 --> 3:09:23.120]  or break your will.
[3:09:23.120 --> 3:09:24.880]  People ask, why am I will so strong?
[3:09:24.880 --> 3:09:27.120]  Well, it's this information that's allowed me
[3:09:27.120 --> 3:09:27.960]  to stand against them.
[3:09:27.960 --> 3:09:30.280]  It's this information that God put in all of us
[3:09:30.280 --> 3:09:34.400]  that is our shield, our armor, our sword against this fraud.
[3:09:34.400 --> 3:09:38.400]  So I wanna invite you all now to be part of history
[3:09:38.400 --> 3:09:40.160]  and to join me at resetwars.com.
[3:09:40.160 --> 3:09:43.120]  Reset Wars is now live, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:09:43.120 --> 3:09:44.800]  As we prepare to go into the year 2022,
[3:09:44.800 --> 3:09:47.080]  such a critical year in these midterm elections,
[3:09:47.080 --> 3:09:48.240]  now more than ever,
[3:09:48.240 --> 3:09:51.200]  you have to realize the innate power you have.
[3:09:51.200 --> 3:09:53.280]  When you also go to resetwars.com
[3:09:53.280 --> 3:09:54.320]  and sign up for the course,
[3:09:54.320 --> 3:09:56.800]  you'll learn about a whole new system that we're building
[3:09:56.800 --> 3:09:59.360]  that only members will have access to.
[3:09:59.360 --> 3:10:02.040]  So this is the gateway to a wider world
[3:10:02.040 --> 3:10:05.960]  and literally to connecting to the divine and beyond.
[3:10:05.960 --> 3:10:08.360]  It is resetwars.com.
[3:10:08.360 --> 3:10:11.040]  The course is now live, history is now happening.
[3:10:11.040 --> 3:10:12.920]  You also fund the info war when you do this.
[3:10:12.920 --> 3:10:14.160]  So it's a 360 win.
[3:10:14.160 --> 3:10:15.720]  Thank you all for your past support
[3:10:15.720 --> 3:10:18.240]  and join me now at resetwars.com.
[3:10:18.240 --> 3:10:20.200]  This information is critical
[3:10:20.200 --> 3:10:21.560]  that if people actually research it,
[3:10:21.560 --> 3:10:24.120]  discover how real it is and then teach others,
[3:10:24.120 --> 3:10:25.160]  this is the secret weapon
[3:10:25.160 --> 3:10:27.000]  to break out of their matrix-like system.
[3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:29.120]  Secondarily, Info Wars needs funding.
[3:10:29.120 --> 3:10:31.520]  We're launching some major new projects in their future
[3:10:31.520 --> 3:10:32.680]  in just a few months.
[3:10:32.680 --> 3:10:34.640]  We've got all these globalist attacks happening right now.
[3:10:34.640 --> 3:10:37.960]  2022 is the year they're trying to sew up the New World Order
[3:10:37.960 --> 3:10:39.360]  and take everybody down.
[3:10:39.360 --> 3:10:40.920]  So I need a lot of capital.
[3:10:40.920 --> 3:10:43.840]  And so the price of the course will go to keep us on air.
[3:10:43.840 --> 3:10:45.440]  So I wanna thank you all for your past support.
[3:10:45.440 --> 3:10:47.120]  I wanna encourage you all now to realize
[3:10:47.120 --> 3:10:48.320]  how far we've come together
[3:10:48.320 --> 3:10:50.000]  and what we've been through together.
[3:10:50.000 --> 3:10:51.280]  And we don't want all that work
[3:10:51.280 --> 3:10:53.280]  to just be thrown away to the side
[3:10:53.280 --> 3:10:55.840]  right at the point of its culmination
[3:10:55.840 --> 3:10:57.080]  and our greatest victories.
[3:10:57.080 --> 3:10:58.840]  So thank you all for your support.
[3:10:58.840 --> 3:11:01.600]  Please continue to visit infowarstore.com

[3:11:04.400 --> 3:11:06.200]  All of that also helps fund the operation
[3:11:06.200 --> 3:11:07.840]  but make sure your life more enriched and better.

[3:11:22.600 --> 3:11:27.600]  The latest in the Alex Jones legacy.
[3:11:27.640 --> 3:11:29.920]  Oh, and Troy are taking over now for Alex
[3:11:29.920 --> 3:11:31.400]  here on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[3:11:31.400 --> 3:11:33.320]  We're gonna squeeze in a couple calls.
[3:11:34.640 --> 3:11:36.240]  And we got a couple other videos
[3:11:36.240 --> 3:11:38.680]  that we are going to play as well.
[3:11:39.640 --> 3:11:42.560]  But we've had some callers waiting for a while now
[3:11:42.560 --> 3:11:45.920]  including Leah in Oklahoma.
[3:11:45.920 --> 3:11:48.240]  So let's go to Leah now.
[3:11:49.320 --> 3:11:50.280]  Or is it Lee?
[3:11:50.280 --> 3:11:52.520]  Lee in Oklahoma or Leah, however it is,
[3:11:52.520 --> 3:11:54.600]  you're on the Alex Jones show, go ahead.
[3:11:55.600 --> 3:11:57.240]  Hi, Ellen, thanks for taking my call.
[3:11:57.240 --> 3:11:59.600]  It's Leah in Oklahoma.
[3:11:59.600 --> 3:12:01.480]  All right, thanks for calling.
[3:12:01.480 --> 3:12:04.800]  Hey, I wanted to start by thanking you for all
[3:12:04.800 --> 3:12:07.680]  you and Alex do and your crew for everybody.
[3:12:07.680 --> 3:12:12.680]  And I'd also like to plug X2 and vitamin mineral fusion
[3:12:12.960 --> 3:12:17.400]  and DNA force plus, all those products really
[3:12:17.400 --> 3:12:21.320]  gave me a life back after battling some cancer.
[3:12:22.280 --> 3:12:24.920]  Anyway, the reason why I'm calling today
[3:12:24.920 --> 3:12:29.920]  is because I know a girl that got vaccinated
[3:12:29.920 --> 3:12:34.120]  and she breastfed her baby afterward.
[3:12:35.520 --> 3:12:40.520]  And now the baby is kind of having some complications.
[3:12:42.360 --> 3:12:46.440]  The doctor actually told her that he has a rare virus
[3:12:46.440 --> 3:12:51.440]  called enterovirus and I read a little bit about it.
[3:12:53.520 --> 3:12:58.320]  Usually it causes hand, foot, and mouth.
[3:12:58.320 --> 3:13:02.440]  Disease, I guess it's like a rash,
[3:13:03.560 --> 3:13:05.280]  but he's showing different symptoms
[3:13:05.280 --> 3:13:07.320]  and I read more about it
[3:13:07.320 --> 3:13:11.280]  and it started mentioning myocarditis and polio.
[3:13:14.120 --> 3:13:15.400]  And I just think that that's weird
[3:13:15.400 --> 3:13:20.400]  because I remember Fauci talking about
[3:13:20.840 --> 3:13:23.080]  seeing polio-like symptoms.
[3:13:23.080 --> 3:13:28.080]  And I'm just wondering if kids are gonna start seeing this
[3:13:30.040 --> 3:13:33.360]  from COVID vaccines or if this is from
[3:13:34.480 --> 3:13:37.560]  like the childhood vaccines or what's going on?
[3:13:38.960 --> 3:13:43.960]  Well, when we see the anomalies like in child heart failure
[3:13:45.600 --> 3:13:47.560]  or myocarditis or some of this other stuff,
[3:13:47.560 --> 3:13:52.400]  then we can probably say we can reach a reasonable conclusion
[3:13:52.400 --> 3:13:55.080]  that that's directly tied into the COVID vaccines.
[3:13:55.080 --> 3:13:57.960]  They obviously haven't done much research.
[3:13:57.960 --> 3:13:59.400]  They haven't had the time.
[3:13:59.400 --> 3:14:04.400]  They're trying to keep all the research data under wraps
[3:14:05.280 --> 3:14:06.120]  as long as possible.
[3:14:06.120 --> 3:14:08.960]  They're saying 75 years before they wanna declassify it.
[3:14:09.920 --> 3:14:14.920]  But we have seen an increase in miscarriages
[3:14:15.680 --> 3:14:18.840]  and women losing their children
[3:14:18.840 --> 3:14:20.520]  when getting the vaccine in pregnant.
[3:14:20.520 --> 3:14:22.840]  So that's the one anomaly that we have seen.
[3:14:22.840 --> 3:14:25.840]  We obviously know that it causes the COVID injection,
[3:14:25.840 --> 3:14:28.000]  myocarditis and other heart problems,
[3:14:28.000 --> 3:14:31.000]  specifically in young, healthy men, it seems like the most.
[3:14:32.080 --> 3:14:37.080]  So that's really just what we know off of neutral observation.
[3:14:38.320 --> 3:14:40.640]  But as far as what's gonna be happening to kids
[3:14:40.640 --> 3:14:43.560]  that get born when their mothers take a vaccine
[3:14:43.560 --> 3:14:45.920]  or God forbid two or three even,
[3:14:45.920 --> 3:14:49.680]  I'm sure we're gonna be learning some not good things
[3:14:49.680 --> 3:14:51.160]  in the near future.
[3:14:51.160 --> 3:14:53.000]  And perhaps what you're talking about
[3:14:53.000 --> 3:14:55.040]  with your friend is an example.
[3:14:55.040 --> 3:14:57.160]  Has any of the doctors that you guys talked about
[3:14:57.160 --> 3:14:59.000]  talked about any of the breastfed babies
[3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:01.080]  or have they not heard anything either?
[3:15:02.600 --> 3:15:04.200]  I haven't heard too much about this,
[3:15:04.200 --> 3:15:07.480]  but again, you're talking about a situation where
[3:15:07.480 --> 3:15:11.080]  it's probably the smallest sample study that we have yet,
[3:15:11.080 --> 3:15:13.200]  obviously because pregnancy takes time.
[3:15:13.200 --> 3:15:16.960]  So the vaccine has only been out about a year now.
[3:15:16.960 --> 3:15:21.000]  And so how many mothers have gotten the vaccine
[3:15:21.000 --> 3:15:22.400]  while they're pregnant and had births?
[3:15:22.400 --> 3:15:24.960]  It's still a relatively low number, I'm sure.
[3:15:24.960 --> 3:15:27.800]  So we'll learn more and I'm sure there'll be something
[3:15:27.800 --> 3:15:29.480]  about it and we'll find out years down the road,
[3:15:29.480 --> 3:15:32.200]  not just the children getting born with problems
[3:15:32.200 --> 3:15:33.600]  when the mom takes COVID vaccine,
[3:15:33.600 --> 3:15:35.520]  but probably a problem with mothers
[3:15:35.520 --> 3:15:37.560]  not even be able to breastfeed their babies
[3:15:37.560 --> 3:15:38.720]  because of the COVID vaccine.
[3:15:38.720 --> 3:15:40.880]  So I'm sure it'll all come out soon,
[3:15:40.880 --> 3:15:42.600]  but I might be dead and gone
[3:15:42.600 --> 3:15:45.200]  because it might take 70 or more years.
[3:15:45.200 --> 3:15:47.320]  Leah, thank you so much for the call.
[3:15:48.320 --> 3:15:50.040]  Hope that your friend ends up okay
[3:15:50.040 --> 3:15:51.560]  and that newborn baby ends up okay.
[3:15:51.560 --> 3:15:52.960]  But you know what, it's for the greater good.
[3:15:52.960 --> 3:15:53.800]  There's too many humans,
[3:15:53.800 --> 3:15:55.000]  so it's probably for the greater good.
[3:15:55.000 --> 3:15:56.200]  What if you could cut your...
[3:15:56.200 --> 3:15:59.960]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[3:15:59.960 --> 3:16:02.040]  It can be very stressful dealing
[3:16:02.040 --> 3:16:04.280]  with facts you refuse to accept.
[3:16:04.280 --> 3:16:06.320]  If you have a family member suffering
[3:16:06.320 --> 3:16:08.720]  from this degenerative mental condition,
[3:16:08.720 --> 3:16:11.000]  buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil
[3:16:11.000 --> 3:16:13.120]  from InfowarsStore.com.
[3:16:13.120 --> 3:16:15.480]  Studies have suggested that fish oils
[3:16:15.480 --> 3:16:17.320]  and fish oil supplementation
[3:16:17.320 --> 3:16:19.400]  can slightly lower blood pressure,
[3:16:19.400 --> 3:16:21.480]  decrease triglyceride levels,
[3:16:21.480 --> 3:16:23.600]  decrease the growth rate of plaque,
[3:16:23.600 --> 3:16:25.440]  and provide a soothing reduction
[3:16:25.440 --> 3:16:28.120]  in inflammatory responses in joints
[3:16:28.120 --> 3:16:29.760]  and the digestive system.
[3:16:29.760 --> 3:16:33.160]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA
[3:16:33.160 --> 3:16:36.880]  and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[3:16:36.880 --> 3:16:38.960]  by increasing the concentration
[3:16:38.960 --> 3:16:41.280]  and activity of immune cells.
[3:16:41.280 --> 3:16:44.200]  It worked for my family, and now I can have
[3:16:44.200 --> 3:16:47.880]  a logical and calm discussion about actual facts
[3:16:47.880 --> 3:16:49.840]  that pertain to reality.
[3:16:49.840 --> 3:16:52.040]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend,
[3:16:52.040 --> 3:16:55.880]  family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[3:16:55.880 --> 3:17:00.440]  Get our great bag of it here.
[3:17:00.440 --> 3:17:01.800]  I mean, this is from, people say,
[3:17:01.800 --> 3:17:05.000]  why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[3:17:05.000 --> 3:17:07.240]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world
[3:17:07.240 --> 3:17:09.880]  that's wild harvested above organic
[3:17:09.880 --> 3:17:12.320]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[3:17:12.320 --> 3:17:14.360]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers
[3:17:14.360 --> 3:17:15.880]  that, you know, the media calls communists,
[3:17:15.880 --> 3:17:17.080]  but really they're just a commune.
[3:17:17.080 --> 3:17:19.360]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee
[3:17:19.360 --> 3:17:20.200]  and we've got it.
[3:17:20.200 --> 3:17:22.320]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[3:17:22.320 --> 3:17:24.080]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels,
[3:17:24.080 --> 3:17:25.680]  and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years
[3:17:25.680 --> 3:17:26.760]  and the price has never gone up.
[3:17:26.760 --> 3:17:28.840]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name
[3:17:28.840 --> 3:17:30.960]  for about 50% more per pound.
[3:17:30.960 --> 3:17:32.520]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee
[3:17:32.520 --> 3:17:33.600]  you're gonna find anywhere.
[3:17:33.600 --> 3:17:35.440]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend
[3:17:35.440 --> 3:17:38.000]  from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[3:17:38.000 --> 3:17:40.240]  I didn't find, I'm not gonna tell you a little story.
[3:17:42.720 --> 3:17:45.120]  We had one, you wouldn't believe it.
[3:17:45.120 --> 3:17:47.960]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com
[3:17:47.960 --> 3:17:49.680]  and that's how we fund this operation.
[3:17:49.680 --> 3:17:52.280]  And if you don't fund us and don't wanna see it, that's fine.
[3:17:56.280 --> 3:17:59.120]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action
[3:17:59.120 --> 3:18:01.600]  and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[3:18:01.600 --> 3:18:04.600]  Half the population has lined up for an untested,
[3:18:04.600 --> 3:18:07.520]  deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[3:18:07.520 --> 3:18:09.080]  because they were told to be afraid
[3:18:09.080 --> 3:18:11.680]  of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[3:18:11.680 --> 3:18:14.720]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal
[3:18:14.720 --> 3:18:17.320]  of having 80% of the population hooked up
[3:18:17.320 --> 3:18:19.920]  to an artificial intelligence hive mind
[3:18:19.920 --> 3:18:21.640]  in less than nine years.
[3:18:21.640 --> 3:18:24.000]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell,
[3:18:24.000 --> 3:18:25.880]  we know this is all really happening
[3:18:25.880 --> 3:18:28.400]  and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[3:18:28.400 --> 3:18:30.960]  But there is only two things to do.
[3:18:30.960 --> 3:18:34.080]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[3:18:34.080 --> 3:18:37.440]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[3:18:37.440 --> 3:18:40.160]  But even when we win and we eventually will,
[3:18:40.160 --> 3:18:42.800]  the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[3:18:42.800 --> 3:18:45.640]  And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth
[3:18:45.640 --> 3:18:49.560]  of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear,
[3:18:49.560 --> 3:18:53.600]  seeds, shortwave radios and lifesaving knowledge
[3:18:53.600 --> 3:18:55.680]  at infowarstore.com.
[3:18:55.680 --> 3:19:00.320]  In late August, infowar saw an explosion of orders
[3:19:00.320 --> 3:19:03.480]  because our audience understands that the globalist
[3:19:03.480 --> 3:19:06.720]  are destabilizing the planet by design
[3:19:06.720 --> 3:19:08.920]  and are attempting to cause an economic
[3:19:08.920 --> 3:19:11.960]  and financial collapse worldwide.
[3:19:11.960 --> 3:19:12.760]  Now, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:19:12.760 --> 3:19:14.520]  storable food has always been something
[3:19:14.520 --> 3:19:15.560]  that's important to have.
[3:19:15.560 --> 3:19:17.520]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have,
[3:19:17.520 --> 3:19:20.480]  taking care of, right along with water filtration,
[3:19:20.480 --> 3:19:22.920]  self-defense and a relationship with God.
[3:19:22.920 --> 3:19:24.360]  But now more than ever,
[3:19:24.360 --> 3:19:26.320]  you need to get your storable food orders in.
[3:19:26.320 --> 3:19:28.960]  Now, we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours
[3:19:28.960 --> 3:19:29.800]  of your order.
[3:19:29.800 --> 3:19:32.080]  It's high quality, it's very, very low cost
[3:19:32.080 --> 3:19:35.200]  at infowarstore.com because in the future,
[3:19:35.200 --> 3:19:37.480]  you're gonna see more food supply shortages
[3:19:37.480 --> 3:19:39.800]  and you're gonna see food supply price increases
[3:19:39.800 --> 3:19:41.120]  that are already taking place.
[3:19:41.120 --> 3:19:44.080]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price
[3:19:44.080 --> 3:19:47.320]  and fund the infowar at infowarstore.com.
[3:19:47.320 --> 3:19:49.200]  That's how you fight the great reset
[3:19:49.200 --> 3:19:52.080]  is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[3:19:52.080 --> 3:19:54.920]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[3:19:57.480 --> 3:20:00.280]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[3:20:00.280 --> 3:20:07.760]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:07.760 --> 3:20:28.480]  So if thanks to the grace of God,
[3:20:28.480 --> 3:20:30.000]  we hadn't had such great effects
[3:20:30.000 --> 3:20:32.040]  and been the zeitgeist so many times,
[3:20:32.040 --> 3:20:33.200]  I wouldn't expect you to believe me,
[3:20:33.200 --> 3:20:36.280]  but I'm always faithful, I'm always true
[3:20:36.280 --> 3:20:37.880]  and I know that if you take the information
[3:20:37.880 --> 3:20:41.520]  of reset wars and grasp it and really listen to it
[3:20:41.520 --> 3:20:44.720]  and really research it, because in the six plus hours,
[3:20:44.720 --> 3:20:46.840]  you can spend a year going into each little piece of it,
[3:20:46.840 --> 3:20:48.800]  literally if you spend all day.
[3:20:48.800 --> 3:20:50.600]  But if you actually grasp it,
[3:20:50.600 --> 3:20:52.120]  it's the most valuable thing in the world,
[3:20:52.120 --> 3:20:55.280]  better than an eight year education in my view.
[3:20:55.280 --> 3:20:57.960]  And it's at resetwars.com right now,
[3:20:57.960 --> 3:21:00.200]  25% off until tomorrow at midnight.
[3:21:00.200 --> 3:21:01.760]  But Jake, let's get into it.
[3:21:01.760 --> 3:21:04.160]  People wanna know what's in the course.
[3:21:04.160 --> 3:21:06.800]  Go over just a quick snapshot of it.
[3:21:06.800 --> 3:21:08.960]  So last night I was up till 2, 3 a.m.
[3:21:08.960 --> 3:21:10.680]  I went back through the whole course for Alex.
[3:21:10.680 --> 3:21:13.080]  He asked me to break down everything
[3:21:13.080 --> 3:21:16.200]  and just go straight so you know what you're getting.
[3:21:16.200 --> 3:21:20.760]  So we got chapter one is the mind wars and spirit wars,
[3:21:20.760 --> 3:21:24.000]  because the reset wars course,
[3:21:24.000 --> 3:21:26.680]  Alex actually decided to make it two courses and ones.
[3:21:26.680 --> 3:21:28.720]  You're buying actually two courses,
[3:21:28.720 --> 3:21:30.680]  the mind wars and the spirit wars.
[3:21:30.680 --> 3:21:32.760]  So chapter one, you're gonna learn
[3:21:32.760 --> 3:21:35.880]  how the war on your mind is being waged
[3:21:35.880 --> 3:21:39.040]  and discover the five simple tricks
[3:21:39.040 --> 3:21:41.440]  you can use to protect yourself and your family.
[3:21:41.440 --> 3:21:43.040]  This is all practical here.
[3:21:43.040 --> 3:21:46.560]  So part number two, learn how the war on your soul
[3:21:46.560 --> 3:21:50.080]  is being waged and the 11 biblical secrets
[3:21:50.080 --> 3:21:53.960]  to build a personal connection to God.
[3:21:53.960 --> 3:21:56.800]  Last part, chapter one, you'll discover three exercises
[3:21:56.800 --> 3:21:59.160]  you can easily do on a daily basis
[3:21:59.160 --> 3:22:01.400]  to raise your consciousness and protect yourself
[3:22:01.400 --> 3:22:04.520]  from the toxic negativity the mass media machine
[3:22:04.520 --> 3:22:06.120]  throws at you every day.
[3:22:06.120 --> 3:22:09.880]  Now, one of my favorite chapters is chapter two.
[3:22:09.880 --> 3:22:12.320]  Alex called this one beyond the great reset.
[3:22:12.320 --> 3:22:16.320]  So as I was going back through everything last night,
[3:22:16.320 --> 3:22:18.680]  my note says, discover what the great reset
[3:22:18.680 --> 3:22:20.560]  is really about, hint.
[3:22:20.560 --> 3:22:23.600]  It has nothing to do with one world government.
[3:22:23.600 --> 3:22:25.400]  It's even more sinister.
[3:22:25.400 --> 3:22:27.120]  And if you do not learn,
[3:22:27.120 --> 3:22:29.560]  you cannot protect yourself and your family.
[3:22:29.560 --> 3:22:33.080]  This is really what Klaus Schwab and Mark Zuckerberg
[3:22:33.080 --> 3:22:34.800]  don't want you to know.
[3:22:34.800 --> 3:22:38.800]  Then Alex goes into the nature of reality in chapter three.
[3:22:38.800 --> 3:22:41.440]  So chapter three is about uncovering the truth
[3:22:41.440 --> 3:22:44.400]  about the quantum physics, the science of consciousness
[3:22:44.400 --> 3:22:46.240]  and the true nature of reality.
[3:22:46.240 --> 3:22:48.520]  And, Jack, for me, this is my favorite chapter.
[3:22:48.520 --> 3:22:49.600]  I agree.
[3:22:49.600 --> 3:22:51.680]  And I really like chapter eight or nine
[3:22:51.680 --> 3:22:53.040]  when you get into God and out.
[3:22:53.040 --> 3:22:54.000]  And close it all out there.
[3:22:54.000 --> 3:22:54.960]  I mean, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[3:22:54.960 --> 3:22:58.560]  But so you're gonna learn how to apply.
[3:22:58.560 --> 3:22:59.400]  This is huge here.
[3:22:59.400 --> 3:23:03.480]  You're gonna learn how to apply Nobel Prize-winning physicist
[3:23:03.480 --> 3:23:05.880]  and mathematician's discoveries
[3:23:05.880 --> 3:23:09.720]  in order to create your own reality.
[3:23:09.720 --> 3:23:12.360]  Learn the hidden teachings of Albert Einstein
[3:23:12.360 --> 3:23:15.640]  and how to use them to master your consciousness.
[3:23:15.640 --> 3:23:18.080]  You're gonna see the scientific proof
[3:23:18.080 --> 3:23:19.840]  behind your connection to God
[3:23:19.840 --> 3:23:22.720]  and what the elite do to ruin this bond
[3:23:22.720 --> 3:23:24.320]  for you every single day.
[3:23:24.320 --> 3:23:26.200]  And that's why this whole course is practical
[3:23:26.200 --> 3:23:28.680]  about protecting yourself, your friends, your family.
[3:23:28.680 --> 3:23:29.520]  Then last.
[3:23:29.520 --> 3:23:31.640]  This is what Dr. Zalinko talks about, God-consciousness.
[3:23:31.640 --> 3:23:34.440]  You have it, we're simply pointing out exercises
[3:23:34.440 --> 3:23:35.280]  to get there.
[3:23:35.280 --> 3:23:37.080]  For reconnect, it's there.
[3:23:37.080 --> 3:23:39.960]  God's knocking, you gotta open the door.
[3:23:39.960 --> 3:23:41.400]  Yeah, this is all practical.
[3:23:41.400 --> 3:23:42.840]  This is not theory.
[3:23:42.840 --> 3:23:45.200]  This is set up in such an empowering way.
[3:23:45.200 --> 3:23:48.040]  This is a super weapon for goodness, folks.
[3:23:48.040 --> 3:23:50.680]  Believe me, they're freaking out over this right now.
[3:23:50.680 --> 3:23:52.520]  So forgiveness is chapter seven.
[3:23:52.520 --> 3:23:54.040]  This one's a really cool chapter
[3:23:54.040 --> 3:23:56.800]  because you're gonna find out how to let go
[3:23:56.800 --> 3:23:59.280]  of unconscious negative emotions
[3:23:59.280 --> 3:24:01.000]  that are keeping you anxious and free.
[3:24:01.000 --> 3:24:02.920]  And that is what they did to you is what they did.
[3:24:02.920 --> 3:24:04.800]  By hating them, you're giving them power.
[3:24:04.800 --> 3:24:08.000]  You don't get weak for giving them.
[3:24:08.000 --> 3:24:10.000]  Turning elusive, this makes you stronger.
[3:24:10.000 --> 3:24:12.240]  Yeah, and you're watching this.
[3:24:12.240 --> 3:24:13.840]  You know what's happening in the world, right?
[3:24:13.840 --> 3:24:15.760]  And it's very easy when you know what's happening
[3:24:15.760 --> 3:24:16.600]  in the world.
[3:24:16.600 --> 3:24:17.440]  That's what we're on race war.
[3:24:17.440 --> 3:24:19.120]  We're angry about it.
[3:24:19.120 --> 3:24:19.960]  We're upset about it.
[3:24:19.960 --> 3:24:22.280]  And rightfully so, but that's what traps us
[3:24:22.280 --> 3:24:23.640]  in the emotional control grid,
[3:24:23.640 --> 3:24:25.840]  which is the term Alex coined in the course
[3:24:25.840 --> 3:24:28.480]  about trapping you in the mental and emotional plane.
[3:24:28.480 --> 3:24:30.400]  And that's how they keep the matrix going.
[3:24:30.400 --> 3:24:32.360]  So he shows how to break out of that.
[3:24:32.360 --> 3:24:35.640]  You're gonna learn Alex's literal, his personal story
[3:24:35.640 --> 3:24:38.280]  of how we overcame his hatred of the globalist
[3:24:38.280 --> 3:24:39.800]  and learn to forgive them.
[3:24:39.800 --> 3:24:42.840]  So it would not destroy his life with anger anymore.
[3:24:42.840 --> 3:24:45.360]  You're gonna practice simple exercises of forgiveness
[3:24:45.360 --> 3:24:47.000]  that will instantly make you happier
[3:24:47.000 --> 3:24:49.080]  and heal your personal relationships,
[3:24:49.080 --> 3:24:50.960]  learn how to take your anger and stress
[3:24:50.960 --> 3:24:54.080]  and transmute that energy into creativity
[3:24:54.080 --> 3:24:56.880]  so you can change your life and defeat the great reset.
[3:24:56.880 --> 3:24:58.040]  This is important.
[3:24:58.040 --> 3:25:00.080]  It's about the transmutation of energy.
[3:25:00.080 --> 3:25:01.920]  Energy's never created or destroyed
[3:25:01.920 --> 3:25:02.760]  earlier in the course.
[3:25:02.760 --> 3:25:04.560]  That's what makes you angry, we control you.
[3:25:04.560 --> 3:25:07.720]  No, anger's fine when you're in control of it.
[3:25:07.720 --> 3:25:08.880]  They don't direct your anger.
[3:25:08.880 --> 3:25:09.720]  Yep.
[3:25:09.720 --> 3:25:11.240]  And this is why this is so powerful.
[3:25:11.240 --> 3:25:14.680]  He says, we will prepare for angry world.
[3:25:14.680 --> 3:25:17.120]  But what Alex has done is broken down
[3:25:17.120 --> 3:25:20.680]  these very top level Nobel Prize winning physicists
[3:25:20.680 --> 3:25:24.200]  and mathematicians to use these laws of the universe.
[3:25:24.200 --> 3:25:25.840]  Energy's never created or destroyed
[3:25:25.840 --> 3:25:28.800]  to take that energy of anger, transmute it,
[3:25:28.800 --> 3:25:31.760]  turn it into creativity for creative solutions,
[3:25:31.760 --> 3:25:32.600]  ideas so we can defeat it.
[3:25:32.600 --> 3:25:33.440]  And it doesn't happen immediately.
[3:25:33.440 --> 3:25:34.920]  It long rhythmically doubles
[3:25:34.920 --> 3:25:36.360]  the more your will's involved
[3:25:36.360 --> 3:25:37.480]  and the more you're alive
[3:25:37.480 --> 3:25:39.040]  in connection with others that agree with you.
[3:25:39.040 --> 3:25:41.920]  Then it accelerates.
[3:25:41.920 --> 3:25:44.040]  So when we come back from a break,
[3:25:44.040 --> 3:25:45.920]  I'm gonna get into persistence,
[3:25:45.920 --> 3:25:48.000]  courage, God's spirituality.
[3:25:48.000 --> 3:25:49.800]  Alex even has a series of prayers
[3:25:49.800 --> 3:25:51.760]  that are incredibly powerful.
[3:25:51.760 --> 3:25:53.200]  We're gonna break all of this down,
[3:25:53.200 --> 3:25:54.800]  how to find your purpose.
[3:25:54.800 --> 3:25:56.920]  And so it's resetwars.com.
[3:25:56.920 --> 3:25:58.320]  Resetwars.com.
[3:25:58.320 --> 3:26:00.360]  We're hitting with everything we've got.
[3:26:00.360 --> 3:26:02.480]  I mean, I'm literally putting my guts out on the table.
[3:26:02.480 --> 3:26:03.720]  Like, how did I do this?
[3:26:03.720 --> 3:26:04.560]  What do I understand?
[3:26:04.560 --> 3:26:05.840]  What is my metaphysical view?
[3:26:05.840 --> 3:26:08.200]  This is something outside of anything anybody else says.
[3:26:08.200 --> 3:26:09.160]  This is the truth.
[3:26:11.680 --> 3:26:14.480]  And you can find it at resetwars.com.
[3:26:14.480 --> 3:26:15.880]  Let me take a phone call real quick
[3:26:15.880 --> 3:26:18.080]  before we go to our next break.
[3:26:18.080 --> 3:26:22.520]  And let's go to Laura Lee in Ontario.
[3:26:22.520 --> 3:26:24.280]  Laura Lee, you're on the Alex Jones show.
[3:26:24.280 --> 3:26:25.120]  Go ahead.
[3:26:26.720 --> 3:26:27.560]  Hi, Owen.
[3:26:27.560 --> 3:26:30.560]  Thanks so much for having me and taking my phone call.
[3:26:30.560 --> 3:26:33.800]  I'm a Canadian podcaster and registered nurse
[3:26:33.800 --> 3:26:35.880]  of my own show, The Angel Rock,
[3:26:35.880 --> 3:26:38.480]  on a larger network out in New Orleans, Louisiana
[3:26:38.480 --> 3:26:40.600]  called the United Public Radio Network.
[3:26:40.600 --> 3:26:44.240]  But the reason I'm calling is for two reasons very quickly.
[3:26:44.240 --> 3:26:47.400]  One of them is just to make people aware.
[3:26:47.400 --> 3:26:48.400]  I'm not seeing enough of this.
[3:26:48.400 --> 3:26:50.440]  I'm not going to see it mainstream media.
[3:26:50.440 --> 3:26:52.840]  That coming in January across North America,
[3:26:52.840 --> 3:26:55.560]  they are forcing truckers to get the job.
[3:26:55.560 --> 3:26:58.720]  I refuse to call it a vaccine because it's not a vaccine.
[3:26:58.720 --> 3:27:01.360]  What that means is very quickly,
[3:27:01.360 --> 3:27:02.920]  and there was somebody that made a video
[3:27:02.920 --> 3:27:04.320]  I was just sent today,
[3:27:04.320 --> 3:27:07.600]  even if 15% of truckers lose their jobs,
[3:27:07.600 --> 3:27:11.440]  that is very quickly going to affect supply and demand.
[3:27:11.440 --> 3:27:12.680]  So it's not to scare people,
[3:27:12.680 --> 3:27:15.440]  to give people a heads up if you haven't prepared already.
[3:27:15.440 --> 3:27:17.880]  Now's the time to start getting what you need
[3:27:17.880 --> 3:27:19.480]  in the way of essentials,
[3:27:19.480 --> 3:27:21.640]  because if the truckers aren't there,
[3:27:21.640 --> 3:27:23.800]  we're not going to be getting what we get on our shelves,
[3:27:23.800 --> 3:27:25.360]  even stuff we order online.
[3:27:25.360 --> 3:27:28.960]  See, here's the problem is it's hard to convince people
[3:27:28.960 --> 3:27:30.880]  to have a sense of urgency
[3:27:30.880 --> 3:27:34.720]  because the sense of urgency is such a fight or flight
[3:27:34.720 --> 3:27:39.720]  response mechanism where for us here,
[3:27:39.880 --> 3:27:42.320]  we're in the crosshairs of the new world order.
[3:27:42.320 --> 3:27:43.840]  I mean, we're being persecuted.
[3:27:43.840 --> 3:27:45.400]  I mean, I don't need to get into everything
[3:27:45.400 --> 3:27:47.680]  that goes on, everybody knows that.
[3:27:47.680 --> 3:27:49.560]  So the sense of urgency for us comes naturally,
[3:27:49.560 --> 3:27:51.200]  like we have a survival instinct,
[3:27:51.200 --> 3:27:53.960]  but for most people it just, it hasn't hit home yet,
[3:27:53.960 --> 3:27:54.800]  but it's going to.
[3:27:54.800 --> 3:27:57.280]  And so when stuff like what you're talking about
[3:27:57.280 --> 3:27:58.640]  starts to happen and people start to see
[3:27:58.640 --> 3:28:01.520]  their gas prices go up and their grocery bill go up
[3:28:01.520 --> 3:28:02.800]  and their energy bills go up,
[3:28:02.800 --> 3:28:05.400]  and now all of a sudden they don't even have all the food
[3:28:05.400 --> 3:28:07.680]  that they're used to getting at the grocery store available
[3:28:07.680 --> 3:28:08.880]  because the supply chain shortage is.
[3:28:08.880 --> 3:28:10.720]  I mean, people are slowly going to realize,
[3:28:10.720 --> 3:28:14.280]  yeah, you are in a war for the planet right now.
[3:28:14.280 --> 3:28:17.960]  Things are not just as they were or normal anymore,
[3:28:17.960 --> 3:28:21.600]  or as the famous line goes, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[3:28:22.600 --> 3:28:23.720]  Exactly.
[3:28:23.720 --> 3:28:26.040]  The other thing I wanted to add very quickly,
[3:28:26.040 --> 3:28:28.480]  and with being a podcaster and so grateful
[3:28:28.480 --> 3:28:30.000]  you talked to people from all over the world,
[3:28:30.000 --> 3:28:33.120]  I used my platform to speak out against the tyranny
[3:28:33.120 --> 3:28:35.320]  that's going on and educating people.
[3:28:35.320 --> 3:28:38.160]  But did you know that in the Canadian government website
[3:28:38.160 --> 3:28:41.280]  that's still up there, under if somebody goes to
[3:28:41.280 --> 3:28:46.280]  canada.gov.ca, searches grenades and goes through there,
[3:28:46.720 --> 3:28:50.360]  back as far as 2015, the Canadian government
[3:28:50.360 --> 3:28:52.840]  was looking for makers of grenades and tear gas.
[3:28:52.840 --> 3:28:54.840]  We gotta go to a break.
[3:28:54.840 --> 3:28:55.920]  You know, listeners call.
[3:28:55.920 --> 3:28:58.440]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients
[3:28:58.440 --> 3:29:00.120]  we put in InfoWars Live products,
[3:29:00.120 --> 3:29:01.680]  and that's why for more than two years
[3:29:01.680 --> 3:29:03.600]  we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth,
[3:29:03.600 --> 3:29:07.200]  and we could never get the ingredients again until now,
[3:29:07.200 --> 3:29:09.440]  and we have reformulated and not just used
[3:29:09.440 --> 3:29:11.480]  the same ingredients, we've boosted it
[3:29:11.480 --> 3:29:13.280]  and made them even stronger.
[3:29:13.280 --> 3:29:15.120]  So out of all the bone broths out there,
[3:29:15.120 --> 3:29:17.120]  I'm telling you, this is next level.
[3:29:17.120 --> 3:29:18.320]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[3:29:18.320 --> 3:29:21.400]  Cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder
[3:29:21.400 --> 3:29:23.480]  for better flavor and dissolvability.
[3:29:23.480 --> 3:29:25.560]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom,
[3:29:25.560 --> 3:29:28.400]  bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder,
[3:29:28.400 --> 3:29:31.080]  and a bunch of other amazing known berries,
[3:29:31.080 --> 3:29:33.000]  the turbocharger body with antioxidants,
[3:29:33.000 --> 3:29:34.600]  and then it's got a bunch of other incredible things
[3:29:34.600 --> 3:29:37.160]  like magnesium, potassium, and sodium added.
[3:29:37.160 --> 3:29:38.560]  I mean, this sucker has got everything
[3:29:38.560 --> 3:29:39.600]  for your electrolytes.

[3:29:51.960 --> 3:29:55.760]  out of the gates at infowarsstore.com.
[3:29:55.760 --> 3:30:00.400]  In late August, InfoWars saw an explosion of orders
[3:30:00.400 --> 3:30:02.640]  because our audience understands
[3:30:02.640 --> 3:30:05.760]  that the globalists are destabilizing the planet
[3:30:05.760 --> 3:30:09.000]  by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[3:30:09.000 --> 3:30:12.040]  and financial collapse worldwide.
[3:30:12.040 --> 3:30:12.880]  Now, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:30:12.880 --> 3:30:14.600]  storeable food has always been something
[3:30:14.600 --> 3:30:15.680]  that's important to have.
[3:30:15.680 --> 3:30:17.640]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have,
[3:30:17.640 --> 3:30:20.560]  taking care of, right along with water filtration,
[3:30:20.560 --> 3:30:23.000]  self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[3:30:23.000 --> 3:30:24.480]  But now more than ever,
[3:30:24.480 --> 3:30:26.400]  you need to get your storeable food orders in.
[3:30:26.400 --> 3:30:28.200]  Now, we're ready to ship to you

[3:30:32.160 --> 3:30:35.280]  at infowarsstore.com, because in the future,
[3:30:35.280 --> 3:30:37.560]  you're gonna see more food supply shortages,
[3:30:37.560 --> 3:30:39.880]  and you're gonna see food supply price increases
[3:30:39.880 --> 3:30:41.200]  that are already taking place.
[3:30:41.200 --> 3:30:44.120]  So lock in your storeable food now at a lower price
[3:30:44.120 --> 3:30:47.400]  and fund the InfoWars at infowarsstore.com.
[3:30:47.400 --> 3:30:49.280]  That's how you fight the great reset
[3:30:49.280 --> 3:30:52.120]  is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[3:30:52.120 --> 3:30:54.960]  So get prepared now at infowarsstore.com.
[3:30:55.960 --> 3:30:58.840]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action,
[3:30:58.840 --> 3:31:01.320]  and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[3:31:01.320 --> 3:31:03.200]  Half the population has lined up
[3:31:03.200 --> 3:31:05.800]  for an untested, deadly, and debilitating
[3:31:05.800 --> 3:31:08.040]  experimental injection because they were told
[3:31:08.040 --> 3:31:11.400]  to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[3:31:11.400 --> 3:31:14.440]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal
[3:31:14.440 --> 3:31:17.000]  of having 80% of the population hooked up
[3:31:17.000 --> 3:31:19.640]  to an artificial intelligence hive mind
[3:31:19.640 --> 3:31:21.360]  in less than nine years.
[3:31:21.360 --> 3:31:23.720]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell,
[3:31:23.720 --> 3:31:25.560]  we know this is all really happening,
[3:31:25.560 --> 3:31:28.120]  and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[3:31:28.120 --> 3:31:30.680]  But there is only two things to do.
[3:31:30.680 --> 3:31:32.320]  We continue sounding the alarm
[3:31:32.320 --> 3:31:33.800]  because it's a numbers game.
[3:31:33.800 --> 3:31:37.160]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[3:31:37.160 --> 3:31:39.840]  But even when we win, and we eventually will,
[3:31:39.840 --> 3:31:42.520]  the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[3:31:42.520 --> 3:31:45.200]  And so we must prepare, get up to a years
[3:31:45.200 --> 3:31:48.160]  worth of storable foods, water filtration,
[3:31:48.160 --> 3:31:51.600]  survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios,
[3:31:51.600 --> 3:31:55.440]  and lifesaving knowledge at infowarsstore.com.
[3:31:55.440 --> 3:31:59.160]  Everything I do is about victory for humanity.
[3:31:59.160 --> 3:32:01.360]  Everything I promote is about
[3:32:01.360 --> 3:32:03.520]  standing up against the new world order
[3:32:03.520 --> 3:32:05.200]  by empowering humanity.
[3:32:05.200 --> 3:32:07.320]  Well, that's why resetwars.com is so important.
[3:32:07.320 --> 3:32:09.760]  Not only is it a game-changing course
[3:32:09.760 --> 3:32:13.080]  of critical information to unlock your mind from the matrix,
[3:32:13.080 --> 3:32:16.080]  but it's something that gets around
[3:32:16.080 --> 3:32:18.360]  Paul Schwab's attempt to shut down
[3:32:18.360 --> 3:32:22.520]  American infrastructure and American jobs.
[3:32:22.520 --> 3:32:24.760]  It is the true digital economy.
[3:32:24.760 --> 3:32:27.800]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind
[3:32:27.800 --> 3:32:29.960]  and transcendent control.
[3:32:29.960 --> 3:32:31.680]  I've been on there 28 years,
[3:32:31.680 --> 3:32:34.680]  and all of our work has been amazing thanks to God
[3:32:34.680 --> 3:32:38.040]  and God's divine empowerment and blessing.
[3:32:38.040 --> 3:32:39.800]  But I gotta tell you, out of everything I've done,
[3:32:39.800 --> 3:32:42.240]  resetwars is the most important,
[3:32:42.240 --> 3:32:44.120]  and it is now available now
[3:32:44.120 --> 3:32:45.920]  at the month of December, 2021.
[3:32:45.920 --> 3:32:48.680]  It's here at resetwars.com.
[3:32:48.680 --> 3:32:51.000]  Start your journey to the next level today
[3:32:51.000 --> 3:32:55.360]  at resetwars.com, the globalist fear this information.
[3:32:55.360 --> 3:32:58.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[3:32:58.800 --> 3:33:02.200]  of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:08.600 --> 3:33:12.800]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:12.800 --> 3:33:16.600]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War,
[3:33:16.600 --> 3:33:20.000]  and now your host, Owen Shroyer.
[3:33:20.000 --> 3:33:22.000]  Owen Shroyer.
[3:33:25.200 --> 3:33:26.840]  All right, I wanted to let Laura Lee finish up.
[3:33:26.840 --> 3:33:29.760]  She was cut off before the break.
[3:33:29.760 --> 3:33:31.960]  Discussing something going on in Canada.
[3:33:31.960 --> 3:33:34.840]  Laura, pick it up where you left off quickly.
[3:33:35.840 --> 3:33:38.160]  Very quickly, thank you very quickly, Owen.
[3:33:38.160 --> 3:33:40.200]  So what I was saying is when you go
[3:33:40.200 --> 3:33:43.400]  and you look up grenades on Canada.gov.ca,
[3:33:43.400 --> 3:33:47.000]  you can find us far back in numerous places.
[3:33:47.000 --> 3:33:50.440]  For companies that make these products
[3:33:50.440 --> 3:33:55.080]  to submit for Canada's response to COVID-19.
[3:33:55.080 --> 3:33:57.240]  My whole point of mentioning this is
[3:33:57.240 --> 3:34:00.240]  they always put out what they're gonna do
[3:34:00.240 --> 3:34:03.880]  and encourage people to look at your own government website,
[3:34:03.880 --> 3:34:05.400]  comb through there and see what you'll find
[3:34:05.400 --> 3:34:09.560]  because this definitely is a pandemic and scam damage.
[3:34:09.560 --> 3:34:12.080]  Like how did that end up back there in 2015?
[3:34:13.800 --> 3:34:15.760]  Yeah, there's no doubt about it now.
[3:34:15.760 --> 3:34:16.880]  The cat's out of the bag.
[3:34:16.880 --> 3:34:18.840]  I don't even think anybody denies it anymore.
[3:34:18.840 --> 3:34:21.760]  Even worldwide governments are admitting
[3:34:21.760 --> 3:34:23.680]  that it came out of the lab in Wuhan.
[3:34:23.680 --> 3:34:26.720]  So they get away with massive crimes,
[3:34:27.720 --> 3:34:32.000]  creating viruses in labs, releasing them on the planet.
[3:34:32.960 --> 3:34:35.880]  And then you have innocent men and women
[3:34:35.880 --> 3:34:38.240]  being politically persecuted and tortured in jail cells
[3:34:38.240 --> 3:34:39.240]  in the United States of America.
[3:34:39.240 --> 3:34:40.840]  The world is upside down.
[3:34:42.200 --> 3:34:44.120]  Absolutely, that's why it's so important
[3:34:44.120 --> 3:34:45.520]  that what you guys are doing there
[3:34:45.520 --> 3:34:47.640]  and I wanna wish you all a Merry Christmas,
[3:34:47.640 --> 3:34:49.560]  all the best in the New Year, stay safe
[3:34:49.560 --> 3:34:51.960]  and thank you for taking my phone call.
[3:34:51.960 --> 3:34:54.920]  Thank you for calling the kind words of support
[3:34:54.920 --> 3:34:56.680]  and the support over the years.
[3:34:56.680 --> 3:34:58.520]  Quickly now, before we go back to phone calls,
[3:34:58.520 --> 3:35:01.040]  here's more from Alex Jones
[3:35:01.040 --> 3:35:05.160]  on the latest Infowars Project Reset Wars.
[3:35:05.160 --> 3:35:07.560]  This is another one of my favorite chapters.
[3:35:07.560 --> 3:35:08.760]  Like I said, at this point,
[3:35:08.760 --> 3:35:10.400]  I probably went through the course 10 times.
[3:35:10.400 --> 3:35:11.560]  I went through the entire core.
[3:35:11.560 --> 3:35:14.360]  I was up till 2, 3 a.m. putting this together.
[3:35:14.360 --> 3:35:15.640]  So I went through it again last night.
[3:35:15.640 --> 3:35:18.240]  So if you're watching this and you haven't bought yet,
[3:35:18.240 --> 3:35:20.000]  maybe you heard us talk about it a lot now
[3:35:20.000 --> 3:35:21.520]  and you're like, oh, I'm promoting it a lot.
[3:35:21.520 --> 3:35:24.440]  But this really is one of the greatest things, I think,
[3:35:24.440 --> 3:35:25.920]  that Alex has ever said.
[3:35:25.920 --> 3:35:27.920]  Folks, everything we've done has been game changing.
[3:35:27.920 --> 3:35:29.360]  You've gotta get this.
[3:35:29.360 --> 3:35:31.400]  It supports us, which is a winning move
[3:35:31.400 --> 3:35:32.600]  and it's really powerful.
[3:35:32.600 --> 3:35:35.320]  It'll get you focused on stuff you already know innately.
[3:35:35.320 --> 3:35:38.000]  That's all we're doing is countering all the Satanism,
[3:35:38.000 --> 3:35:39.400]  all the brainwashing, all the lies
[3:35:39.400 --> 3:35:41.120]  and reminding you who you are.
[3:35:41.120 --> 3:35:43.800]  I know who you are, cause I'm like you.
[3:35:43.800 --> 3:35:44.640]  Absolutely.
[3:35:44.640 --> 3:35:48.320]  So we got chapter eight is on the theme here
[3:35:48.320 --> 3:35:50.640]  is persistence, courage and motivation.
[3:35:50.640 --> 3:35:52.600]  So you're gonna learn the top techniques
[3:35:52.600 --> 3:35:56.120]  that Alex Jones uses to motivate himself
[3:35:56.120 --> 3:35:58.200]  so that you can find more persistence
[3:35:58.200 --> 3:35:59.440]  and motivation in your life.
[3:35:59.440 --> 3:36:00.560]  Cause that's what we need.
[3:36:00.560 --> 3:36:01.800]  Everyone's gotta get motivated.
[3:36:01.800 --> 3:36:04.520]  Everyone's gotta be able to tap into that same place
[3:36:04.520 --> 3:36:06.800]  that Alex, that Owen, that the Info Wars crew
[3:36:06.800 --> 3:36:09.640]  has been able to do to take on this system.
[3:36:09.640 --> 3:36:11.680]  Yeah, just the info here is worth the course.
[3:36:11.680 --> 3:36:14.840]  Yeah, no, this is a powerful section.
[3:36:14.840 --> 3:36:17.160]  You're gonna also hear some hilarious,
[3:36:17.160 --> 3:36:19.680]  untold stories from Alex Jones' career
[3:36:19.680 --> 3:36:21.120]  about how he was able to tap
[3:36:21.120 --> 3:36:22.640]  into the power of persistence stories.
[3:36:22.640 --> 3:36:25.360]  I never knew that I was literally bursting out laughing
[3:36:25.360 --> 3:36:27.880]  while we were putting that outline together
[3:36:27.880 --> 3:36:29.480]  that are just, they're just hilarious.
[3:36:29.480 --> 3:36:30.320]  And of course-
[3:36:30.320 --> 3:36:32.600]  Yeah, we spent months just preparing to shoot this.
[3:36:32.600 --> 3:36:33.960]  Yeah, this is some powerful stuff.
[3:36:33.960 --> 3:36:37.600]  So we got, you're gonna practice three exercises
[3:36:37.600 --> 3:36:40.720]  that will instantly help you overcome your deepest fears,
[3:36:40.720 --> 3:36:43.880]  achieve more success, and find the courage
[3:36:43.880 --> 3:36:48.400]  to save America and the world from this tyranny
[3:36:48.400 --> 3:36:49.240]  that we're facing.
[3:36:49.240 --> 3:36:50.720]  And it's not like we're just saying that,
[3:36:50.720 --> 3:36:52.280]  we're already almost there.
[3:36:52.280 --> 3:36:53.120]  We're almost there.
[3:36:53.120 --> 3:36:53.960]  With the Lester support.
[3:36:53.960 --> 3:36:55.640]  You did that, the same thing.
[3:36:55.640 --> 3:36:58.280]  We're there folks, we're almost the top of the mountain.
[3:36:58.280 --> 3:37:00.080]  Then we've got chapter nine,
[3:37:00.080 --> 3:37:03.560]  which is on this probably my second favorite chapter,
[3:37:03.560 --> 3:37:05.920]  other than the nature of reality at the beginning.
[3:37:05.920 --> 3:37:08.280]  So this is on God, spirituality,
[3:37:08.280 --> 3:37:10.080]  and Alex has a bunch of prayers
[3:37:10.080 --> 3:37:11.120]  that are really powerful.
[3:37:11.120 --> 3:37:13.920]  And so you're gonna get access
[3:37:13.920 --> 3:37:17.320]  to Alex's top seven spiritual prayers
[3:37:17.320 --> 3:37:19.680]  that he uses to connect to God,
[3:37:19.680 --> 3:37:22.720]  to renew his mind and spirit instantly,
[3:37:22.720 --> 3:37:24.560]  that you can do in your own home
[3:37:24.560 --> 3:37:26.800]  to protect your friends, your family,
[3:37:26.800 --> 3:37:29.840]  and to tap into the Holy Spirit.
[3:37:29.840 --> 3:37:31.160]  So you're gonna learn the secret.
[3:37:31.160 --> 3:37:33.200]  And literally I can be depressed, under attack,
[3:37:33.200 --> 3:37:35.040]  horrible things, just open up to God,
[3:37:35.040 --> 3:37:38.400]  and realize it's all just, we made again.
[3:37:38.400 --> 3:37:42.000]  Absolutely, so we have learn the new world order secrets
[3:37:42.000 --> 3:37:44.760]  about science, God, and Jesus Christ.
[3:37:44.760 --> 3:37:47.080]  This one will really change your life.
[3:37:47.080 --> 3:37:48.520]  This is what they're keep hitting.
[3:37:48.520 --> 3:37:51.240]  This is why Vice News attacked this before it came out.
[3:37:51.240 --> 3:37:53.160]  Last but not least from chapter nine,
[3:37:53.160 --> 3:37:55.520]  is learn the number one hidden teachings of Jesus
[3:37:55.520 --> 3:37:57.200]  that explain the nature of reality,
[3:37:57.200 --> 3:38:00.680]  and what's really happening in the world right now.
[3:38:04.680 --> 3:38:06.040]  All right, we're back live now
[3:38:06.040 --> 3:38:09.000]  in the InfoWars studios here in Austin, Texas.
[3:38:09.000 --> 3:38:09.840]  Owen Troyer with you.
[3:38:09.840 --> 3:38:11.160]  We're gonna take a couple more phone calls.
[3:38:11.160 --> 3:38:12.640]  We got a couple segments left here.
[3:38:12.640 --> 3:38:16.040]  A little bit of time left on the Alex Jones show.
[3:38:16.040 --> 3:38:18.680]  And then I've just got a loaded war room coming up today
[3:38:18.680 --> 3:38:23.320]  with great guests and a stack of news that's just wild,
[3:38:23.320 --> 3:38:24.960]  that we're dealing with all of this.
[3:38:24.960 --> 3:38:26.360]  But we go back to the phone lines now.
[3:38:26.360 --> 3:38:28.560]  Jim is dialed in from Michigan.
[3:38:28.560 --> 3:38:30.840]  Jim, you're on the Alex Jones show, go ahead.
[3:38:30.840 --> 3:38:35.840]  Yeah, Owen, there's citizens, doctors, professionals
[3:38:40.800 --> 3:38:45.000]  all around the world that have spoken up
[3:38:45.000 --> 3:38:47.120]  and they put their self on the line.
[3:38:47.120 --> 3:38:50.560]  We have yourself, Alex,
[3:38:50.560 --> 3:38:53.440]  and what gets left out a lot in my mind
[3:38:53.440 --> 3:38:56.480]  when I hear people is your crew.
[3:38:56.480 --> 3:39:00.440]  And they're all putting everything on the line
[3:39:00.440 --> 3:39:02.240]  to fight this.
[3:39:02.240 --> 3:39:05.440]  And my question is, where's Trump?
[3:39:05.440 --> 3:39:08.240]  And so when it comes to the vaccination,
[3:39:08.240 --> 3:39:12.920]  which I'll specify is he came out and said he took it.
[3:39:12.920 --> 3:39:14.360]  He said his wife took it.
[3:39:15.480 --> 3:39:18.600]  And he's gonna stop voter fraud.
[3:39:20.240 --> 3:39:22.200]  He sold the world a lot of benefits
[3:39:22.200 --> 3:39:24.400]  because when all this is going on
[3:39:24.400 --> 3:39:26.120]  and people are marching and fighting,
[3:39:26.120 --> 3:39:30.160]  there were Trump signs all around this world.
[3:39:30.160 --> 3:39:34.760]  And folks are waiting and they put a lot of trust in him.
[3:39:35.600 --> 3:39:40.600]  And last week, Stu Peters interviewed Mark Meadows
[3:39:46.240 --> 3:39:49.440]  and he promised, and Stu Peters made him promise
[3:39:49.440 --> 3:39:51.480]  that he would take documents to Trump.
[3:39:52.680 --> 3:39:56.440]  And I don't know who heard that, but I'm waiting for it.
[3:39:56.440 --> 3:40:01.440]  And Trump and his wife did take the shot,
[3:40:02.120 --> 3:40:05.320]  which was with Johnson and Johnson specifically.
[3:40:05.320 --> 3:40:06.480]  Are they compromised?
[3:40:07.640 --> 3:40:09.120]  Are they gonna get sick?
[3:40:10.440 --> 3:40:12.600]  And my question to you,
[3:40:12.600 --> 3:40:14.720]  and I have a couple other things and that's it.
[3:40:14.720 --> 3:40:18.720]  I'll let you go, but are they in on this?
[3:40:19.840 --> 3:40:21.520]  Where's Trump going?
[3:40:23.240 --> 3:40:26.080]  Well, look, Trump is not above criticism
[3:40:26.080 --> 3:40:29.040]  and there's plenty you can criticize Trump over,
[3:40:29.040 --> 3:40:33.760]  but when you talk about the skin
[3:40:33.760 --> 3:40:35.240]  that InfoWars has in the game
[3:40:35.240 --> 3:40:37.280]  or Alex or myself or this crew,
[3:40:39.000 --> 3:40:40.960]  it is just not fair to say
[3:40:40.960 --> 3:40:42.640]  that Trump doesn't have any skin in the game either.
[3:40:42.640 --> 3:40:44.800]  I mean, Trump is being politically persecuted
[3:40:44.800 --> 3:40:45.880]  as much as anybody else.
[3:40:45.880 --> 3:40:49.760]  I mean, he's got the New York Democrats after him 24 seven.
[3:40:49.760 --> 3:40:51.800]  They're coming after his taxes.
[3:40:51.800 --> 3:40:53.040]  They go after his family.
[3:40:53.040 --> 3:40:56.000]  Now again, I understand plenty of frustration
[3:40:56.000 --> 3:40:59.000]  with Trump, I completely get it.
[3:41:00.400 --> 3:41:02.600]  You had the signs at Trump Tower in New York,
[3:41:02.600 --> 3:41:04.520]  which who knows if he's even in charge of this anymore
[3:41:04.520 --> 3:41:06.280]  that say you can't come in unless you're vaccinated.
[3:41:06.280 --> 3:41:08.240]  So look, I get it.
[3:41:08.240 --> 3:41:10.320]  Plenty of fair criticism for Trump,
[3:41:10.320 --> 3:41:13.720]  but Trump for four years was leading from the front
[3:41:13.720 --> 3:41:18.720]  and took all kinds of political slings and arrows and rocks
[3:41:19.080 --> 3:41:21.280]  from the corrupt establishment and exposed a lot of them.
[3:41:21.280 --> 3:41:26.280]  So I'm not gonna sit here and obsess over Trump
[3:41:26.920 --> 3:41:29.040]  because he was never going to be my savior
[3:41:30.880 --> 3:41:33.080]  and there's gonna be plenty of fair criticism of Trump,
[3:41:33.080 --> 3:41:36.600]  but I'm not also gonna sit here and throw the baby out
[3:41:36.600 --> 3:41:40.280]  with the bathwater and act like Trump never did anything
[3:41:40.280 --> 3:41:42.200]  for anybody when he was leading from the front
[3:41:42.200 --> 3:41:45.800]  for four years and is continuing to be politically persecuted
[3:41:45.800 --> 3:41:46.640]  by the Democrats.
[3:41:46.640 --> 3:41:49.160]  So yeah, he might not be in a jail cell right now
[3:41:49.160 --> 3:41:54.160]  getting tortured, but he's got him up his ass to 24 seven.
[3:41:56.200 --> 3:41:58.480]  They censor him on the internet now too.
[3:41:58.480 --> 3:42:00.000]  They come after his businesses.
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:03.280]  So Trump definitely has skin in the game.
[3:42:03.280 --> 3:42:07.840]  And I don't think, I mean saying he's sold out is,
[3:42:09.000 --> 3:42:10.720]  I mean, I understand why people would believe that,
[3:42:10.720 --> 3:42:13.000]  believe me, you don't think people try to tell us every day
[3:42:13.000 --> 3:42:15.000]  what you're saying here?
[3:42:15.000 --> 3:42:16.240]  Or even the notion that, hey,
[3:42:16.240 --> 3:42:19.320]  do you think Trump set you up on January 6th?
[3:42:20.840 --> 3:42:23.760]  I want you to know that the thing,
[3:42:23.760 --> 3:42:25.960]  the difference is that you're out there
[3:42:25.960 --> 3:42:29.520]  with your skin in the game and you might be the one
[3:42:29.520 --> 3:42:33.200]  that is in the clink getting tortured.
[3:42:33.200 --> 3:42:34.920]  And I want to know where he's at.
[3:42:34.920 --> 3:42:37.520]  And I think it's a fair question to ask.
[3:42:37.520 --> 3:42:39.120]  Well, yeah, I mean, I'll tell you, he's nowhere.
[3:42:39.120 --> 3:42:40.120]  He's nowhere.
[3:42:40.120 --> 3:42:43.360]  If it comes to me being politically persecuted
[3:42:43.360 --> 3:42:46.200]  and thrown in jail, yeah, Trump is not gonna save me.
[3:42:46.200 --> 3:42:48.320]  He never was, is my point though.
[3:42:49.440 --> 3:42:51.480]  And so hopefully there's some members of Congress
[3:42:51.480 --> 3:42:53.080]  that want to stop the political persecution
[3:42:53.080 --> 3:42:54.400]  and torture of prisoners.
[3:42:54.400 --> 3:42:56.480]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding.
[3:42:57.840 --> 3:43:00.720]  This could be in full wars last Christmas,
[3:43:00.720 --> 3:43:03.400]  because it could be America's last Christmas.
[3:43:03.400 --> 3:43:05.520]  Evil is taking over the planet.
[3:43:05.520 --> 3:43:07.360]  They're destroying our borders, our sovereignty,
[3:43:07.360 --> 3:43:10.120]  our supply chains, our language, our currencies.
[3:43:10.120 --> 3:43:11.440]  They're coming after us.
[3:43:11.440 --> 3:43:14.160]  And if we don't support American businesses,
[3:43:14.160 --> 3:43:16.080]  and if we don't support independent media
[3:43:16.080 --> 3:43:17.960]  in the final days of 2021,
[3:43:17.960 --> 3:43:20.920]  we have no future in the midterms in 2022.
[3:43:20.920 --> 3:43:25.600]  2022 is the year where America decides its fate.
[3:43:25.600 --> 3:43:27.480]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[3:43:27.480 --> 3:43:29.440]  I want to encourage you to your Christmas shopping
[3:43:29.440 --> 3:43:30.680]  then FullWareStore.com,
[3:43:30.680 --> 3:43:33.080]  because I can barely keep our operation going.
[3:43:33.080 --> 3:43:35.640]  And I appreciate you keeping us in the position
[3:43:35.640 --> 3:43:36.480]  to fight back.
[3:43:36.480 --> 3:43:37.680]  I am so thankful for you.
[3:43:37.680 --> 3:43:39.240]  And I'm asking you now to realize
[3:43:39.240 --> 3:43:41.320]  the huge investment you made over the years in us,
[3:43:41.320 --> 3:43:43.240]  and I'll redouble your efforts
[3:43:43.240 --> 3:43:44.760]  to make sure that your investment
[3:43:44.760 --> 3:43:46.080]  and freedom continues on.
[3:43:46.080 --> 3:43:50.360]  infowarstore.com has incredible products,
[3:43:50.360 --> 3:43:53.160]  store-wide free shipping, up until December 20th.

[3:43:55.400 --> 3:43:56.240]  Thank you.
[3:43:56.240 --> 3:43:58.560]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield,
[3:43:58.560 --> 3:44:01.080]  basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight.
[3:44:01.080 --> 3:44:03.440]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[3:44:03.440 --> 3:44:05.360]  I was barely holding onto a job.
[3:44:05.360 --> 3:44:07.920]  And I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[3:44:07.920 --> 3:44:10.520]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield,
[3:44:10.520 --> 3:44:11.360]  the X1.
[3:44:11.360 --> 3:44:12.400]  And it worked pretty good.
[3:44:12.400 --> 3:44:13.680]  And then shortly thereafter,
[3:44:13.680 --> 3:44:15.240]  we came out with X2, you know,
[3:44:15.240 --> 3:44:16.600]  with a deep burn source, you know,
[3:44:16.600 --> 3:44:17.800]  and I got really excited about that.
[3:44:17.800 --> 3:44:18.640]  So I took it.
[3:44:18.640 --> 3:44:21.640]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog
[3:44:21.640 --> 3:44:24.800]  to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[3:44:24.800 --> 3:44:26.200]  You know, I could think again,
[3:44:26.200 --> 3:44:28.040]  I could connect with people again.
[3:44:28.040 --> 3:44:30.840]  And over the course of the next couple of years,
[3:44:30.840 --> 3:44:33.000]  I got my health back and I religiously take
[3:44:33.000 --> 3:44:34.440]  basically all of your supplements.
[3:44:34.440 --> 3:44:36.840]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[3:44:36.840 --> 3:44:38.680]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[3:44:38.680 --> 3:44:40.880]  It literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[3:44:40.880 --> 3:44:42.160]  It's amazing, it works.
[3:44:42.160 --> 3:44:44.760]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.
[3:44:44.760 --> 3:44:47.240]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[3:44:47.240 --> 3:44:49.800]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health
[3:44:49.800 --> 3:44:50.880]  into our own hands.
[3:44:50.880 --> 3:44:52.080]  Beautifully said, brother.
[3:44:52.080 --> 3:44:54.480]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[3:44:56.160 --> 3:44:58.640]  We have developed the research and the tools
[3:44:58.640 --> 3:45:01.000]  to stop this evil and to break free from it
[3:45:01.000 --> 3:45:02.720]  and to help others to break free from it.
[3:45:02.720 --> 3:45:05.320]  That's why we've launched Reset Wars.
[3:45:05.320 --> 3:45:07.200]  Once you simply accept that there is
[3:45:07.200 --> 3:45:09.400]  an incredibly evil group of people in the world
[3:45:09.400 --> 3:45:11.000]  that are attempting the great reset
[3:45:11.000 --> 3:45:13.760]  and want a one-world corporate government,
[3:45:13.760 --> 3:45:15.760]  then you can learn how to defeat them
[3:45:15.760 --> 3:45:18.280]  by learning their war game strategies
[3:45:18.280 --> 3:45:20.800]  and how to not play the game.
[3:45:20.800 --> 3:45:24.080]  After decades of intense research,
[3:45:24.080 --> 3:45:28.080]  our quest to discover the key to breaking the globalist bonds
[3:45:28.080 --> 3:45:29.800]  is now live.
[3:45:29.800 --> 3:45:32.640]  The Reset Wars have begun.
[3:45:32.640 --> 3:45:36.600]  Start your journey at resetwars.com today.
[3:45:36.600 --> 3:45:39.440]  Their programming are very subconscious on our side key
[3:45:39.440 --> 3:45:43.320]  to create these false constructs that they then control.
[3:45:43.320 --> 3:45:45.040]  We're going to lay out how that works.
[3:45:45.040 --> 3:45:47.920]  Your journey against tyranny and true empowerment begins
[3:45:47.920 --> 3:45:49.600]  at resetwars.com.
[3:45:49.600 --> 3:45:50.720]  Please join me there.
[3:45:55.920 --> 3:45:57.640]  I've been fighting as hard as I can
[3:45:57.640 --> 3:46:00.720]  for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[3:46:00.720 --> 3:46:02.800]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[3:46:02.800 --> 3:46:04.440]  I wanted to wake up the world
[3:46:04.440 --> 3:46:06.640]  and stop them dead in their tracks
[3:46:06.640 --> 3:46:08.360]  before they went operational.
[3:46:08.360 --> 3:46:09.440]  But we failed.
[3:46:09.440 --> 3:46:11.080]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[3:46:11.080 --> 3:46:12.960]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed,
[3:46:12.960 --> 3:46:15.040]  but they are going ahead
[3:46:15.040 --> 3:46:18.960]  with their full operational deindustrialization great reset.
[3:46:18.960 --> 3:46:20.920]  And that's why it's more important than ever
[3:46:20.920 --> 3:46:22.880]  that all viewers and all listeners
[3:46:22.880 --> 3:46:24.960]  tell everybody they know about the show
[3:46:24.960 --> 3:46:26.440]  because people are ready to wake up
[3:46:26.440 --> 3:46:27.880]  and ready to hear the truth.
[3:46:27.880 --> 3:46:29.800]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy
[3:46:29.800 --> 3:46:31.200]  and trying to stop their agenda,
[3:46:31.200 --> 3:46:33.440]  but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[3:46:33.440 --> 3:46:34.600]  And one of the number one things to do
[3:46:34.600 --> 3:46:36.040]  is high-quality, storable food.
[3:46:36.040 --> 3:46:39.200]  You've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices
[3:46:39.200 --> 3:46:40.680]  at infowarstore.com.
[3:46:40.680 --> 3:46:43.400]  So whether it's a month or a six-month or a year supply
[3:46:43.400 --> 3:46:46.280]  or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[3:46:46.280 --> 3:46:49.080]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up
[3:46:49.080 --> 3:46:51.200]  and before there are long lines and waits.
[3:46:51.200 --> 3:46:53.520]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[3:46:53.520 --> 3:46:55.680]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[3:46:57.120 --> 3:46:59.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[3:46:59.920 --> 3:47:06.920]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:15.320 --> 3:47:17.040]  Final segment of the Alex Jones show,
[3:47:17.040 --> 3:47:22.040]  but I will be immediately going into the War Room studio
[3:47:22.040 --> 3:47:23.760]  to host the War Room once this concludes.
[3:47:23.760 --> 3:47:26.160]  So much big breaking news, video clips to get to,
[3:47:26.160 --> 3:47:29.880]  Biden fumbling and bumbling and embarrassing himself all over.
[3:47:29.880 --> 3:47:34.120]  Project Veritas has a big drop coming tonight.
[3:47:34.120 --> 3:47:35.640]  I don't know what time they're supposed to release it.
[3:47:35.640 --> 3:47:38.560]  It may be released by the time I'm off air at 6 p.m. central,
[3:47:38.560 --> 3:47:42.520]  but Project Veritas does a lot of big stuff.
[3:47:42.520 --> 3:47:44.600]  And I obviously have friends over there.
[3:47:44.600 --> 3:47:48.560]  And they'll send me notices when it's about to be a big drop,
[3:47:48.560 --> 3:47:51.560]  like big, like, chattering.
[3:47:51.560 --> 3:47:54.240]  And they're telling me this one tonight is going to be big.
[3:47:54.240 --> 3:47:56.360]  And then they got another one tomorrow.
[3:47:56.360 --> 3:47:59.560]  So be on the lookout for that.
[3:47:59.560 --> 3:48:01.800]  Let's go back to the phones for our final caller, though.
[3:48:01.800 --> 3:48:04.560]  Let's go to Aaron calling in from FEMA Region 6.
[3:48:04.560 --> 3:48:07.960]  Aaron, you're on the Alex Jones show. Go ahead.
[3:48:07.960 --> 3:48:12.480]  Hey, Owen, I wanted to add to what a couple of callers
[3:48:12.480 --> 3:48:16.560]  talked about earlier, Bill Gates and his GMO food.
[3:48:16.560 --> 3:48:19.440]  A couple of weeks ago, I did some research on Bill Gates
[3:48:19.440 --> 3:48:25.440]  and his GMO food hitting a worldwide restaurant, McDonald.
[3:48:25.440 --> 3:48:31.200]  What I found was the soil used to grow McDonald's French fries
[3:48:31.200 --> 3:48:32.800]  owned by Bill Gates.
[3:48:32.800 --> 3:48:36.400]  The potatoes used by McDonald's French fries
[3:48:36.400 --> 3:48:37.600]  owned by Bill Gates.
[3:48:37.600 --> 3:48:40.440]  Carrots used for McDonald's Happy Meals
[3:48:40.440 --> 3:48:44.640]  owned by Bill Gates, all grown on his, you know...
[3:48:44.640 --> 3:48:47.600]  And it's probably GMO carrots, GMO potatoes,
[3:48:47.600 --> 3:48:50.880]  cooked in vegetable oils that are awful for you.
[3:48:50.880 --> 3:48:54.200]  Yeah. And, you know, with the mRNA technology,
[3:48:54.200 --> 3:48:57.720]  we don't know, they might try to give it to the masses here
[3:48:57.720 --> 3:48:59.080]  without them even knowing...
[3:48:59.080 --> 3:49:04.520]  And, you know, look, when I learned about the God-awful diets
[3:49:04.520 --> 3:49:06.680]  that we just accept here in the United States,
[3:49:06.680 --> 3:49:08.520]  America, and all the poisons and chemicals in the food,
[3:49:08.520 --> 3:49:11.520]  I kind of became a food snob for a couple years.
[3:49:11.520 --> 3:49:12.600]  I've kind of backed off that.
[3:49:12.600 --> 3:49:14.520]  I don't judge anybody really for what they eat.
[3:49:14.520 --> 3:49:16.040]  I try to encourage healthy behavior,
[3:49:16.040 --> 3:49:19.280]  and I think that it definitely should be embraced and celebrated.
[3:49:19.280 --> 3:49:21.440]  Obviously, you eat unhealthy, you're going to be unhealthy,
[3:49:21.440 --> 3:49:23.320]  and now we know there's no excuse now.
[3:49:23.320 --> 3:49:26.320]  We know how unhealthy fast food is, frozen food is,
[3:49:26.320 --> 3:49:28.040]  all the synthetic food is.
[3:49:28.040 --> 3:49:30.040]  So there's really no excuse anymore.
[3:49:30.040 --> 3:49:33.800]  But there was a story.
[3:49:33.800 --> 3:49:35.920]  I don't know what happened exactly,
[3:49:35.920 --> 3:49:36.760]  but they switched.
[3:49:36.760 --> 3:49:38.080]  I believe what happened was in the 90s.
[3:49:38.080 --> 3:49:41.040]  I'm trying to go off memory here.
[3:49:41.040 --> 3:49:43.800]  In the 90s, McDonald's,
[3:49:43.800 --> 3:49:46.720]  which was obviously the number one fast food place,
[3:49:46.720 --> 3:49:49.120]  and then some other places followed,
[3:49:49.120 --> 3:49:51.960]  but McDonald's switched, I think, what oils
[3:49:51.960 --> 3:49:53.680]  that they were cooking their foods in,
[3:49:53.680 --> 3:49:55.800]  specifically the fries.
[3:49:55.800 --> 3:49:59.120]  And it was like, there's graphs
[3:49:59.120 --> 3:50:00.520]  that once that decision was made,
[3:50:00.520 --> 3:50:02.760]  like obesity, diabetes, and all this other stuff
[3:50:02.760 --> 3:50:05.640]  started skyrocketing, and this was in the early 90s.
[3:50:05.640 --> 3:50:07.760]  I don't remember exactly how it went down,
[3:50:07.760 --> 3:50:09.640]  but so there's all kinds of anomalies like this
[3:50:09.640 --> 3:50:10.680]  that we can solve.
[3:50:10.680 --> 3:50:14.640]  And so, it's so frustrating to hear crooks like Fauci up there
[3:50:14.640 --> 3:50:17.800]  just promoting vaccines and big farmers and masks all day
[3:50:17.800 --> 3:50:19.560]  when we don't promote exercise,
[3:50:19.560 --> 3:50:21.960]  we don't promote healthy food and healthy diet,
[3:50:21.960 --> 3:50:24.160]  we just promote more poison,
[3:50:24.160 --> 3:50:26.840]  and then more poison in response to the poison
[3:50:26.840 --> 3:50:28.440]  that we're complaining about.
[3:50:29.560 --> 3:50:33.520]  Yeah, it's like he's gonna be growing franken food, basically,
[3:50:33.520 --> 3:50:35.440]  and I think that the people should know
[3:50:35.440 --> 3:50:40.440]  what they're eating as far as it not being natural.
[3:50:40.800 --> 3:50:42.920]  So, as I wanna finish here,
[3:50:42.920 --> 3:50:45.840]  a bioterrorist owning all the soil
[3:50:45.840 --> 3:50:49.720]  and the crops that are used to source the largest fast food
[3:50:49.720 --> 3:50:53.040]  company in the world, what could possibly go wrong?
[3:50:53.040 --> 3:50:54.800]  He's a depopulationist,
[3:50:54.800 --> 3:50:57.360]  so he's coming at you from all angles.
[3:50:59.080 --> 3:51:00.080]  Yeah, and imagine,
[3:51:00.080 --> 3:51:01.000]  because what they really wanna do
[3:51:01.000 --> 3:51:03.360]  is it's all about getting people under the control.
[3:51:03.360 --> 3:51:05.240]  Once they have the climate tyranny in place,
[3:51:05.240 --> 3:51:07.120]  you won't be able to be a farmer anymore,
[3:51:07.120 --> 3:51:10.040]  and it'll just be Bill Gates and BlackRock
[3:51:10.040 --> 3:51:12.840]  that basically makes your synthetic food, GMO food,
[3:51:12.840 --> 3:51:15.560]  and you'll just be eating fake food, dying a slow death,
[3:51:15.560 --> 3:51:17.840]  not living your full life, being unhealthy,
[3:51:17.840 --> 3:51:21.080]  a constant consumer of big pharmaceutical products,
[3:51:21.080 --> 3:51:23.280]  constantly in and out of hospitals,
[3:51:23.280 --> 3:51:26.080]  and that's the plan, that's the new world order,
[3:51:26.080 --> 3:51:27.760]  and it's further greater good,
[3:51:27.760 --> 3:51:29.200]  and so we just have to accept it,
[3:51:29.200 --> 3:51:31.040]  because we're viruses on the planet,
[3:51:31.040 --> 3:51:32.560]  that's what they wanna convince us,
[3:51:32.560 --> 3:51:34.880]  not a divine creation by God.
[3:51:34.880 --> 3:51:35.800]  Yeah, there it is right there.
[3:51:35.800 --> 3:51:37.560]  Does McDonald's still use beef tallow?
[3:51:37.560 --> 3:51:40.320]  At this time, the US did not use beef tallow in its fries,
[3:51:40.320 --> 3:51:43.560]  but replaced it with vegetable oil in the 1990s.
[3:51:43.560 --> 3:51:46.120]  Yeah, so vegetable oil's folks avoid them in all costs.
[3:51:46.120 --> 3:51:47.600]  Aaron, thank you so much for the call.
[3:51:47.600 --> 3:51:49.680]  All right, we now go one more time to Jake Ducey
[3:51:49.680 --> 3:51:53.320]  and Alex Jones on Reset Wars.
[3:51:53.320 --> 3:51:55.760]  We're finishing up with these 12 chapters.
[3:51:55.760 --> 3:51:57.240]  There's 10 chapters, a few extra things,
[3:51:57.240 --> 3:51:59.920]  but let's finish up with what is the end?
[3:51:59.920 --> 3:52:03.560]  Mind War Spirit Wars at resetwars.com.
[3:52:03.560 --> 3:52:05.840]  Yeah, so as you guys know, I'm just,
[3:52:05.840 --> 3:52:07.440]  I'm trying to, this would,
[3:52:07.440 --> 3:52:10.560]  I could take six, eight hours just to go through everything,
[3:52:10.560 --> 3:52:13.000]  so I'm just trying to summarize it the best you can,
[3:52:13.000 --> 3:52:14.920]  so there's, you know, there's no sales pitch,
[3:52:14.920 --> 3:52:17.200]  you know, exactly what's in this,
[3:52:17.200 --> 3:52:19.080]  as you can tell with some powerful stuff,
[3:52:19.080 --> 3:52:22.120]  and now we're moving on to chapter 10,
[3:52:22.120 --> 3:52:24.840]  which is finding your purpose,
[3:52:24.840 --> 3:52:28.040]  and it starts with discover exactly
[3:52:28.040 --> 3:52:29.680]  how to find your purpose in life
[3:52:29.680 --> 3:52:32.160]  with practical exercises to help you,
[3:52:32.160 --> 3:52:33.560]  and I really challenged Alex
[3:52:33.560 --> 3:52:35.760]  when we were putting this together,
[3:52:35.760 --> 3:52:39.680]  sometimes to, you know, a disagreement here or there
[3:52:39.680 --> 3:52:44.320]  to make every single mini-section as practical
[3:52:44.320 --> 3:52:46.480]  and applicable as humanly possible,
[3:52:46.480 --> 3:52:47.320]  so you're not just saying,
[3:52:47.320 --> 3:52:49.840]  I always just do stuff, see to my pants,
[3:52:49.840 --> 3:52:51.760]  we reshut a lot of this three, four times.
[3:52:51.760 --> 3:52:54.440]  Yeah, and not just that, this isn't just theory,
[3:52:54.440 --> 3:52:57.120]  you're getting dozens and dozens and dozens
[3:52:57.120 --> 3:53:00.360]  of very specific things he never talks about on air,
[3:53:00.360 --> 3:53:02.800]  exercises, techniques, tools that he does
[3:53:02.800 --> 3:53:04.240]  that he doesn't talk about on air,
[3:53:04.240 --> 3:53:05.080]  there's a whole set.
[3:53:05.080 --> 3:53:05.920]  But it was all organic,
[3:53:05.920 --> 3:53:07.120]  and that's what we're working for,
[3:53:07.120 --> 3:53:09.880]  codifying how I organically was doing this.
[3:53:09.880 --> 3:53:12.400]  Yeah, exactly, and that's why I say,
[3:53:13.360 --> 3:53:17.160]  and why I'm up here telling you how powerful this is
[3:53:17.160 --> 3:53:18.760]  and why this is so important.
[3:53:18.760 --> 3:53:20.160]  It's because you're powerful.
[3:53:20.160 --> 3:53:22.000]  Yep, and that's how we win.
[3:53:22.000 --> 3:53:23.320]  This is really how we win.
[3:53:23.320 --> 3:53:24.640]  First you recognize you're powerful,
[3:53:24.640 --> 3:53:27.400]  because God made you, then you recognize God's plan,
[3:53:27.400 --> 3:53:29.120]  you decide whether you're gonna join that mission,
[3:53:29.120 --> 3:53:30.160]  then you surrender.
[3:53:30.160 --> 3:53:32.400]  Yep, and that's how we're gonna win this thing,
[3:53:32.400 --> 3:53:34.200]  and believe me, if you're depressed,
[3:53:34.200 --> 3:53:35.520]  if you're stressed, if you're anxious.
[3:53:35.520 --> 3:53:37.440]  That's why it's called surrender,
[3:53:37.440 --> 3:53:39.160]  because we've got our own plans, we get it.
[3:53:39.160 --> 3:53:40.400]  We don't want to be with the devil worshipers,
[3:53:40.400 --> 3:53:43.520]  we surrender, we surrender to God.
[3:53:43.520 --> 3:53:45.680]  Because we're gonna surrender to Klaus Schwab or Bill Gates.
[3:53:45.680 --> 3:53:48.160]  Wouldn't you rather surrender to what created all this?
[3:53:48.160 --> 3:53:51.080]  So we got finding your purpose.
[3:53:51.080 --> 3:53:52.720]  We went over part one, part two,
[3:53:52.720 --> 3:53:55.400]  is find out what your future looks like
[3:53:55.400 --> 3:53:58.720]  and how to discover what God wants for you in life.
[3:53:58.720 --> 3:54:00.920]  Yes, there's actually a technique you'll learn
[3:54:00.920 --> 3:54:03.320]  in Reset Wars that will help you connect to God
[3:54:03.320 --> 3:54:05.600]  to find your purpose, and as a side note
[3:54:05.600 --> 3:54:06.960]  before I hit the rest of these,
[3:54:06.960 --> 3:54:10.360]  is one of the things that I probably learned most
[3:54:10.360 --> 3:54:12.280]  just from watching you record this
[3:54:12.280 --> 3:54:14.640]  and being around you and talking through a lot of it
[3:54:14.640 --> 3:54:18.480]  is your commitment to free will
[3:54:18.480 --> 3:54:22.280]  and that God has these big plans for you,
[3:54:22.280 --> 3:54:24.120]  but it's a God of free will.
[3:54:24.120 --> 3:54:27.400]  And unless you step into this bigger vision for your life
[3:54:27.400 --> 3:54:30.120]  and unless you're watching this do, we can't win.
[3:54:30.120 --> 3:54:32.120]  And that's important.
[3:54:32.120 --> 3:54:33.600]  No, that's it, no, it's, I mean, God's,
[3:54:33.600 --> 3:54:35.400]  and it's not like God gives you a program to follow.
[3:54:35.400 --> 3:54:37.440]  Like the Satanist have an exact program.
[3:54:37.440 --> 3:54:39.320]  If you submit to them, you're ordered under AI,
[3:54:39.320 --> 3:54:40.280]  do this exact thing.
[3:54:40.280 --> 3:54:43.320]  No, God goes, here's all this you can do,
[3:54:43.320 --> 3:54:46.240]  but you must do it in this spectrum, this is my will.
[3:54:46.240 --> 3:54:47.760]  And then you have all this freedom.
[3:54:47.760 --> 3:54:49.360]  Satanist is one little path,
[3:54:49.360 --> 3:54:51.680]  but with God it's just follow the program,
[3:54:51.680 --> 3:54:53.800]  you can do whatever you want in this area.
[3:54:53.800 --> 3:54:55.960]  And once you step into that, it gets stronger
[3:54:55.960 --> 3:54:57.480]  and like it becomes a joke.
[3:54:57.480 --> 3:54:59.480]  Like why isn't everybody following God?
[3:54:59.480 --> 3:55:03.160]  I mean, it's what Dr. Zelenko calls God consciousness.
[3:55:03.160 --> 3:55:05.480]  He's like, this isn't about being Jewish or Christian,
[3:55:05.480 --> 3:55:07.520]  because I love Jesus, I love Christians, he gets it.
[3:55:07.520 --> 3:55:11.320]  It's God, I love Jews, I love a Buddhist, I love everybody.
[3:55:11.320 --> 3:55:14.360]  We love God, we must transcend with God consciousness.
[3:55:14.360 --> 3:55:17.600]  Next we've got, you're gonna learn Alex Jones' top five
[3:55:17.600 --> 3:55:20.640]  techniques to harness the power of your imagination
[3:55:20.640 --> 3:55:24.320]  and the power of consciousness, i.e. the observer effect,
[3:55:24.320 --> 3:55:28.840]  so that you can make mountains move and they shall.
[3:55:28.840 --> 3:55:32.080]  You're gonna practice the number one technique
[3:55:32.080 --> 3:55:35.760]  and method to protect yourself, your family,
[3:55:35.760 --> 3:55:37.680]  from the collapse of America.
[3:55:37.680 --> 3:55:40.560]  And that's what this entire course is about.
[3:55:40.560 --> 3:55:43.440]  It's getting your mind and soul ready.
[3:55:43.440 --> 3:55:44.680]  Yup.
[3:55:44.680 --> 3:55:46.600]  Because look, all they're doing right now
[3:55:46.600 --> 3:55:49.080]  is bombarding us with all this crap to keep us,
[3:55:49.080 --> 3:55:51.360]  that's the psychological warfare component.
[3:55:51.360 --> 3:55:52.960]  And that's why this course is,
[3:55:52.960 --> 3:55:54.760]  reset wars is two courses and one,
[3:55:54.760 --> 3:55:56.720]  you're buying two courses for this.
[3:55:56.720 --> 3:55:59.320]  You're getting the mind wars and the spirit wars.
[3:55:59.320 --> 3:56:01.440]  And that's why they're trying to disconnect this from us.
[3:56:01.440 --> 3:56:02.280]  Well, let me just say this,
[3:56:02.280 --> 3:56:04.440]  because I was literally having dreams about this
[3:56:04.440 --> 3:56:05.920]  and was physically upset about this,
[3:56:05.920 --> 3:56:07.240]  because whenever I'm not doing what I'm supposed to do,
[3:56:07.240 --> 3:56:09.080]  I get upset, but I figure it out, I'm like,
[3:56:09.080 --> 3:56:10.720]  I've gotta expose the AI takeover,
[3:56:10.720 --> 3:56:12.920]  I've gotta expose how they're trying to block us off from God.
[3:56:12.920 --> 3:56:14.440]  I've gotta expose, we have the Holy Spirit,
[3:56:14.440 --> 3:56:15.800]  but I was like, how do I do this?
[3:56:15.800 --> 3:56:17.320]  I've been thinking like, I need to launch a church,
[3:56:17.320 --> 3:56:20.400]  I need to create some religious manifesto,
[3:56:20.400 --> 3:56:22.840]  Christian manifesto, and then along you come going,
[3:56:22.840 --> 3:56:24.960]  let's do a cryptocurrency deal, I go, no,
[3:56:24.960 --> 3:56:27.000]  I want spirit wars, and then you're like,
[3:56:27.000 --> 3:56:30.040]  absolutely, it was all meant to happen.
[3:56:30.040 --> 3:56:31.840]  So this was meant to happen, Jake.
[3:56:31.840 --> 3:56:33.560]  Oh yeah, no, it absolutely was.
[3:56:33.560 --> 3:56:35.440]  I mean, it's, and that's what I mean.
[3:56:35.440 --> 3:56:38.600]  You have no idea what God has planned for you,
[3:56:38.600 --> 3:56:40.760]  how you're supposed to protect your family,
[3:56:40.760 --> 3:56:42.200]  where you're supposed to step into,
[3:56:42.200 --> 3:56:43.440]  and how you're supposed to-
[3:56:43.440 --> 3:56:45.800]  Because you've gotta realize that advanced intelligence,
[3:56:45.800 --> 3:56:47.560]  the omnipresence is waiting,
[3:56:47.560 --> 3:56:49.680]  but it doesn't rape you like Satanist.
[3:56:49.680 --> 3:56:51.360]  It needs you to open up.
[3:56:51.360 --> 3:56:52.480]  And that's the free will,
[3:56:52.480 --> 3:56:54.680]  and that's why we're saying, when you join this course,
[3:56:54.680 --> 3:56:57.280]  and move through it, things start happening in your life,
[3:56:57.280 --> 3:56:59.640]  because you step into the next dimension of free will.
[3:56:59.640 --> 3:57:00.960]  Let's be clear, it's not even what I'm saying,
[3:57:00.960 --> 3:57:02.320]  and it's important what I say,
[3:57:02.320 --> 3:57:04.840]  it's that it gets you in the mindset of this.
[3:57:04.840 --> 3:57:08.960]  And on top of that, even if you aren't quite sure yet,

[3:57:11.240 --> 3:57:13.440]  this is the most important way to fund info wars,

[3:57:16.840 --> 3:57:19.160]  then not to mention, I'll get into more of these bonuses
[3:57:19.160 --> 3:57:20.080]  that we're gonna be offering here.

[3:58:45.320 --> 3:58:47.600]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough
[3:58:47.600 --> 3:58:48.960]  in modern medicine.
[3:58:48.960 --> 3:58:50.800]  Introducing pollen block.
[3:58:50.800 --> 3:58:53.760]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way
[3:58:53.760 --> 3:58:56.160]  to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[3:58:56.160 --> 3:58:59.960]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways,
[3:58:59.960 --> 3:59:03.000]  eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[3:59:03.000 --> 3:59:06.280]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed
[3:59:06.280 --> 3:59:08.360]  that people who ate certain quail eggs
[3:59:08.360 --> 3:59:10.360]  experienced less seasonal immune
[3:59:10.360 --> 3:59:12.360]  and inflammatory responses.
[3:59:12.360 --> 3:59:15.200]  They began studying this effect in published trials
[3:59:15.200 --> 3:59:18.400]  and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research,
[3:59:18.400 --> 3:59:20.760]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[3:59:20.760 --> 3:59:23.560]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[3:59:23.560 --> 3:59:26.200]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[3:59:26.200 --> 3:59:27.960]  It is not an antihistamine.
[3:59:27.960 --> 3:59:29.680]  In fact, current research has found
[3:59:29.680 --> 3:59:33.080]  that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[3:59:33.080 --> 3:59:35.400]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune
[3:59:35.400 --> 3:59:37.680]  and inflammatory responses in the body.
[3:59:37.680 --> 3:59:40.360]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[3:59:40.360 --> 3:59:42.400]  Head to infowarslife.com
[3:59:42.400 --> 3:59:45.560]  and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
