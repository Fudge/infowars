[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:41.600]   Ladies and gentlemen, just kicked off another global transmission, the most demonized, most
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.880]   hated, most lied about broadcast in the world by corrupt global corporations, by chi-coms,
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.240]   by communists, by pedophiles, by scumbags, by fractional reserve banking cartels.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.880]   Thank you so much for joining us as we steam into what I have predicted and what many others
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.280]   have predicted is going to be one hell of a tumultuous, out of control, dangerous year.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.720]   There's going to be a lot of opportunity and also a lot of
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.600]   civil unrest, a lot of economic turmoil, I think a lot of war.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.440]   So everybody better decide which side they're on. A lot of people don't even know what sides
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.160]   there are. That's why the globalists don't want this show on the air because we're laying out
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.600]   from the globalist own white papers, their own statements, how the cow ate the old cabbage
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.920]   and creating a very accurate map for folks to overlay with the disinformation that they see
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.920]   in mainstream media to try to then come up with a solution to counter the globalist technocracy.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.000]   Obviously, Apple just tanked more than 10 percent. The stock market, Dow Jones Industrial
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.480]   Average is down 650 points and still dropping. Oh, and Bloomberg's got the big headline right
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:04.960]   here. It's up on Infowars.com. It's up on Newswars.com. Bloomberg, the Trump slump.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.760]   Why the market said goodbye to the Trump bump? Well, because the Federal Reserve raised a bunch
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.360]   of interest rates and signaled with regulations that the Democrats in the deep state were going
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.800]   to ignore all of the innovations and the attempt to release a lot of hidden technology to get us
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.800]   out of the technology slump. That they're blaming on the global market downturn right now.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:36.240]   So they openly did this and now they think you have no memory and that you're not going to remember
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.240]   what they've done. They're openly cheerleading for the economy implode
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.720]   and then blaming Trump for it, just like they've said in Europe, we're going to blame
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.040]   Italy for economic downturn. We're going to blame the UK for trying to get out of the
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.360]   unelected EU. It's the exact tactic of economic terrorism. But even bigger than the Federal
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.200]   Reserve, raising all these interest hikes than ever once did with Obama. They've now done what,
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.520]   eight times with Trump and signal more to come. Even worse than that is Nancy Pelosi
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:18.880]   says she won't rule out indictment impeachment for Trump and she's called for his indictment
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.800]   before. So the fact that she's about to be sworn in as the Speaker of the House,
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.520]   if it hasn't already happened today. The fact that that Crypt Keeper is back in and the fact
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.120]   that this is being broadcast everywhere means that America won't be open for business and that
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.480]   we'll go back under the globalist plan to break our will to demoralize us and create economic
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.000]   warfare. And of course, we've got Nancy Pelosi's daughter wearing crazy cat lady glasses to hide
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.400]   the fact that her and her mother have gotten over a billion dollars with her dad since Nancy was in
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.000]   the house. She's a little trendy, non-threatening nerd. That's her camouflage for a vicious
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.120]   corporate witch. She's the same one that called for Trump's delegates not to be seated and for
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.840]   him to not be inaugurated on the 20th of 2017. When I said this was traitorous and outrageous,
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.400]   didn't call for her death or any violence. She went on Fox News and said I was calling for violence.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.120]   And we confirmed that they approached the Justice Department and demanded that I be arrested.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:26.240]   But it's okay, she's wearing pink cat lady glasses. So if Hitler wore pink cat lady glasses,
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:33.280]   it'd be okay, right? And that's the whole leprous thing. Hi, everybody, we're not monstrous demons.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.600]   We're not trying to sexualize your children or overthrow elections. No, my mommy didn't get a
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.840]   billion dollars with daddy since she's been in the house when she had nothing. We're not gangsters
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.880]   all mobbed up. No, no, no. Mob bosses look like Don Corleone or Scarface. They don't look like me.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.960]   Just like a lot of people kidnap kids, have little ice cream truck,
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.200]   your little glasses, got a puppy. Come on. Everything's okay.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.480]   The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.920]   the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ. It literally
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.120]   dumbs the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.880]   iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First, seaweed-based iodine
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.800]   that was pretty good, but hard to source. And the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.480]   it. So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2. That's been
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.320]   incredible. Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.520]   more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.120]   research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C,
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.760]   it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable. Ladies and gentlemen, you want
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.560]   to research it, you want to see it. It's an incredible discovery. X3, now available at
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:12.000]   mpullmorselife.com. You are either with the Republic or against it. Resistance to
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.040]   tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:37.360]   Wow. We're already into the third day of 2019. I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:46.560]   We're here Monday through Friday from 11am to 3pm Central Standard Time. The news websites are
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:54.560]   mpullmorselife.com, newswars.com, and prisonplanet.com. And when you share those links,
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.440]   when you spread those articles, when you tell your neighbors and your friends and your church
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:06.160]   and your coworkers about mpullmorselife.com, when you spread the word, it is absolutely
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:14.320]   earth-changing. It is absolutely sending chills of fear into the spines and into the
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.600]   backbones of the globalists. They saw the exponential growth rate of mpullmorselife.com
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.040]   two and a half years ago, and the fact that it was already the biggest multimedia news program
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.440]   in the world, and that it was exponentially growing. And so they said, okay, instead of
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.560]   ignoring mpullmorselife.com, we've got to psychologically inoculate people with disinfo
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:40.720]   and lies about it, so that those spreading the word, word of mouth, will be scared to talk about
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:48.400]   mpullmorselife.com. Lest someone, you know, tell them, oh, that's an evil site, or oh, that site
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:53.040]   hurts the children. It's not the globalists run Vatican raping children by the hundreds of
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:58.240]   thousands. It's not the UN kidnapping children by the tens of thousands. It's not all the Arab
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.320]   Spring funded by Obama and the Democrats killing hundreds of thousands and putting tens of
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:10.400]   thousands of children and women into sex slavery. No. No, ladies and gentlemen, that's not what it
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:18.400]   is. It's all Alex Jones. It's all Infowars. He's the bad man. He's the one that's got to be stopped.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.760]   Well, we told you, and Trump told you, that the Federal Reserve, the private Federal Reserve,
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.640]   kept raising interest rates that it would trigger a downward spiral in the economy.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.400]   Planned out the private Federal Reserve, tied it with other multinational banks,
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.720]   had called for China to continue to have basically unlimited free money and zero percent interest
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:42.640]   rates, and that everything was rigged against the US. So Trump tried to fight that. And now
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.480]   they've had all these interest rate hikes, and they've signaled more interest rate hikes.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:53.040]   And that's driving down the economy. But bigger than that is Nancy Pelosi, about to be sworn in
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.280]   as the Speaker of the House, says she won't rule out indictment impeachment for Trump.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.920]   And that's basically her saying she wants to indict him. Hank Johnson, the guy that says that
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:09.600]   islands float, has come out and called him Hitler and said that he should be thrown out of office.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:15.280]   We have Sheila Jackson Lee and Alexander Cortez calling for reparations to be paid to black
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.680]   people. You've seen what government paychecks to black folks has done. It's ruined their communities.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:25.600]   It's none of that money comes without serious strings. And this is just a country being torn
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:32.080]   apart at the seams. And a lot of people in the world had hoped that Trump could turn things around.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:39.200]   They had hoped that we'd really be open for business.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:48.640]   But a year and a half in, they saw things began to reverse. And so now a growing US economy,
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:54.640]   new jobs coming back is not seen as something that is an absolute, not as a sure thing.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.840]   And the establishment bets on one thing bigger than anything, and it's that you'll be lazy.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:07.280]   And part of that laziness is mental laziness to not have a memory and just not care. And you run
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.800]   into people that haven't trained their memories and you run into others that had a weak memory
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:16.080]   before. But as they get older, it just gets non-existent. They're living in this moment
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:22.480]   to moment and not in a good way. They're not even really conscious. They don't remember that Trump
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:28.240]   just three months ago said, "You wanna be like Venezuela? You don't let us win the House and
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.320]   Senate, it'll signal they're gonna win. And it's gonna be really rocky and that stock market's
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:37.360]   gonna go down." That's a fact. But see, that was three months ago, two months ago.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.280]   Hard to believe November in the election was just two months ago.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:49.360]   Here it is, Bloomberg, the Trump slump. Now, if I put this image out, they'd call it fake news.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:11:00.320]   But all it is is illustrative. That's all it is. Just like him standing over the little girl he
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.480]   supposedly took from her mother. Wasn't a real photo, never happened. But it's all the image
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:10.800]   they need, the image of his red tie being red tape or the country being in the red and celebrating,
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:17.280]   trying to drive the nation back under the waves of despair. And there is their illustration,
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:22.160]   their fake news, the Trump slump, why the market said goodbye to the Trump bump.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:30.400]   And the real reason is the Democrats are making very demoralizing warlike statements
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:35.600]   about how they're gonna kill Trump, how they're gonna indict Trump, how they're gonna murder his
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.760]   family. Republicans are getting shot, they're getting their ribs broken, they're getting attacked
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:46.720]   and nothing's being done. And so that's then taken by people in DC and New York and other areas
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.920]   that were thinking about fighting for the country. And they're thinking, man,
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.960]   this nation's full of a bunch of traitors and a bunch of collaborators and a bunch of scum.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:00.880]   Because people like Nancy Pelosi's daughter can get up on air and say things like Trump
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:08.720]   is going to get his head cut off by my mother. Oh, but he'll never even know it. Well, of course
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.560]   not if you blow somebody's head off or cut their head off, they usually don't know what hit them.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.880]   And that's the whole statement to embolden their criminal forces.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.280]   That's why they've said the deep state's gonna kill this guy.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:27.600]   That's why they said there's seven ways to Sunday to do all this. Because they've got to go around
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:33.120]   person by person and intimidate and threaten everyone in his administration. And most of them
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:38.800]   turn to the other side and say, fine. They're always being told Trump's going down, you're
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:44.640]   going down. A lot of them then hedge their bet. And they say, okay, I'll start giving you intel
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:49.120]   on Trump. And then as soon as their traders giving intel, they go, hey, that's classified
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.880]   information you gave us. We'll sick muller on you if you don't give us more.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:59.200]   And what really makes the deep state mad is that Trump has good instincts,
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.840]   $2 trillion that we've spent in the Middle East.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:10.400]   Just in Afghanistan, Central Asia, it's like 5 trillion in the Middle East last 30 years.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:16.080]   That's more than all our education put together just in the sandbox of death and blood.
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.360]   We should put a wall around and let them all kill each other.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.720]   And Trump says all that is there is sand and death. And that's why they hate him.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.800]   >>
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.280]   >> Use the word slowly when you're describing the withdrawal from super.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.720]   >> I never said fast or slow. >> What's your timetable? When do you want
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.560]   troops to be out? >> I know somebody said four months,
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:41.200]   but I didn't say that either. I'm getting out, we're getting out of Syria. Look,
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:48.880]   we don't want Syria. Obama gave up Syria years ago when he didn't violate the red line.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:57.520]   I did when I shot 59 missiles in, but that was a long time later. And when President Obama
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.800]   decided not to violate his statement that never crossed the red line and then
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:08.720]   they did it, he didn't do anything about it. Making a threat is okay, but you always have to
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.760]   follow through with the threat. If you're gonna make that threat, you can't make a threat and
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:19.600]   then do nothing. So Syria was lost long ago. It was lost long ago. And besides that,
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.880]   I don't want, we're talking about sand and death. That's what we're talking about.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.280]   We're not talking about vast wealth. We're talking about sand and death.

[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:21.360]   So
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:46.320]   [Music]
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:53.120]   Well, ladies and gentlemen, the communist Chinese in 2018
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:21:05.680]   said they would land a probe on the dark side of the moon. And they did do it just yesterday
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:15.280]   in 2019. If you believe them. And that's a question. Now the media says that I say
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:23.520]   we faked the moon landings. I said that there's a lot of secret government technology and a lot of
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:29.840]   it got covered up. They had backup plans and that a lot of people have died in the secret test pilot
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:39.840]   and secret space program. And that's a fact. So mainstream media misrepresents what I've said
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:44.720]   about it. I know we can get to the moon. I know we can go to the Van Allen radiation belt. I know that
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:49.440]   I have personally been friends with multiple individuals that worked on the Apollo program.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:55.280]   And they told me it was 100% real. But there was a lot of times they had to go dark and a lot of
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:59.920]   other secret stuff that was going on that they were compartmentalized from and that was secret.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:06.880]   Now, obviously, when the Chinese craft goes on to the dark side, it's in a dead spot,
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:11.600]   like being in a cave, your cell phone doesn't work. So they're unable to transmit the images back,
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:17.120]   I guess, until their rover gets data, gets back on the spacecraft, takes back off,
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:22.160]   and then can transmit back to Earth the images it's gotten. If we don't start seeing those
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:27.360]   images very, very soon for the mission, then we know that we're being handed a bill of goods.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.640]   Here you're seeing film footage reportedly shot on the moon
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:35.440]   in the different Apollo missions, starting with Apollo 11.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:45.120]   Now, you look at the film footage that was shot in the 1960s, compared to what the Chinese put out,
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:49.840]   and our stuff looks just as good as what the Chinese put out. So if we did fake it,
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:56.720]   we faked it better than they can do in 2019. Again, if you're a TV viewer, you can see
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:01.200]   some of the last images they were able to shoot right before their lunar lander landed and was
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:06.000]   unable to transmit over the horizon from right at the edge of the dark side of the moon. We
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.680]   could pull up some maps that I saw earlier of where they specifically landed. I know that jet
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:16.960]   airplanes are real and take off and fly around the world. I know that they had hot air balloons 600
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:23.920]   years ago. I know they've dug up batteries in ancient Greece and ancient Rome. I know that
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.000]   we can do incredible things. I know this technology that we're using to broadcast right now is real.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.600]   I know that we can create clones of humans. So yes, I know we have space technology. I believe
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.440]   that they're suppressing a lot of the technology. The evidence has showed that, and Trump has
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:44.880]   talked about that. So I believe the Chinese have gone to the moon. The biggest issue was is that
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:52.160]   they did not have enough robotic control in the late 1960s, early 70s to send robots to the
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:57.680]   moon period. And so they sent humans. And it's very, very risky. And it's very,
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:02.320]   very embarrassing when they die. And that's the rest of the story is that I've been told
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:07.600]   by folks without getting into secret stuff, which they wouldn't tell me,
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.680]   that they could only give me examples in pop culture of what was really going on.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:16.080]   And that there was a large and still is a large secret space program. About 90%
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:20.400]   of the space program is secret. And there have been many, many moon missions.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.520]   And there have been many missions to the dark side of the moon.
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:30.320]   I was told by Buzz Aldrin on this show probably 10 years ago, we got to find an interview and
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:39.760]   re-air it, that we should send our next probe to the lone moon of Mars. Because the lone moon of
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:45.760]   Mars has a perfect obelisk on it, transmitting a radio frequency that they'd known about that
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:51.280]   frequency. They had telescopes that were looking at it since the days of the book being written
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:57.760]   2001 Space Odyssey. In fact, there's the interview. It was erased off the Alex Jones channel,
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:04.720]   deleted, but somebody else has it. And that's Encyclopedia Britannica. Or I guess now they feed
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:09.360]   other people's info over everything I say. And that's the astronaut himself. Can't listen to
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.800]   him. Second guy to walk on the moon. Gotta listen to Encyclopedia Britannica. But go ahead and
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:20.800]   expand that. I want to tell people the site that is. That is Floyd Anderson. So that's Floyd
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:26.480]   Anderson. Has that interview saved? So you can go hear it for yourself from 2009. See, I said about
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:31.040]   10 years ago and I'm right. 10 years ago. My memory serves. But oh, that's the new thing.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:38.800]   All news on YouTube now, Google parent company, Alphabet parent company of that, force feeds you
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:46.240]   CNN videos, the top 30 on top and force feeds overlays to CNN dot com of the president speaking.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:52.240]   When he speaks now, they put CNN over him. There's an article on Infowars dot com about it.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:59.440]   The article says YouTube begins inserting CNN articles over all political videos. It's worse
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:03.440]   than that. I went and looked this morning. I went and looked at Trump's latest speech,
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:09.600]   his cabinet meeting. It's all force fed CNN fact checking him a pack of criminal liars.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:15.520]   They're breaking in over the president. See, first, we're just going to break in over the KKK.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.640]   And then we're going to break in over Alex Jones. And then we're going to break in over
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:27.280]   Franklin Graham. And then we're going to just ban everybody. It's here. Congress must act.
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:33.440]   This is outrageous. Sorry, I got sidestepped or sidetracked by that. The rest of the story is.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:40.560]   I was talking to Buzz Aldrin out in L.A. once. And I'm not going to get into the details of the
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:45.920]   meeting. I met with him once in L.A. and then talked on the phone a few times out in L.A.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:51.920]   And he said, Alex, we've got a lot of secret stuff. And they get really mad. I tell you about
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:55.120]   this. We got a lot of fans at NASA that wants you to get things straight, said
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:00.720]   the Chinese the next year are going to say they're going to do this and that because the Indians
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.440]   are working with them. They're good guys. They're going to crash a probe in and discover pure water.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:09.040]   They're going to crash the probe, eject it up so they can be the discoverers of it.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:14.480]   Let me just say we know all about the water up there, my boy. And we've been all over the moon.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:20.640]   And I'm just like, OK. And I did kick that young man's ass that said I was a liar.
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.680]   There's a famous footage of him knocking people out to get in his face.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:29.120]   And so that's Buzz Aldrin. And that's what he told me. And then about eight, nine, 10 months
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:33.920]   later, I'm walking through an airport and I look at the cover of the magazine. It says Indians
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:40.000]   crash probe, discover water and even where they discovered it at the pole. And I remember Buzz
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:48.720]   Aldrin going. Yeah, we like to dole it out slow to him, son. They can't really handle it. Let's
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:53.360]   just say we get the right type of president. There'll be some big announcements. You know,
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:57.680]   NASA helped innovate all the technologies of the world. And if we were just able to release some
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:02.640]   of the new technologies, we've got my boy. Well, let's just say our problems would be solved. But
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:08.560]   there are certain people that don't want the public to have all that. And I just think they
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:14.080]   deserve it. After all, you did pay for it. I did pay for a sign. But you can bet your bottom dollar
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:21.200]   we've been to the moon and a little bit further than that. That's Buzz Aldrin. And I'm going to
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:26.480]   leave it at that. And then he got threatened not to talk to me anymore and he won't talk to me
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:32.400]   anymore. And that's fine. But, oh, I guess if this video was allowed on YouTube by the censors that
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:37.520]   have Encyclopedia Britannica over it, maybe saying I'm a moon landing hoaxer, which I'm not. See,
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.320]   but that's what you go to Britannica to learn, I guess, these days.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:47.200]   All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back on the other side. But to be clear,
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:52.160]   I don't think there's any human slaves on Mars. And I do believe the Chinese just landed on the
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:56.800]   dark side of the moon. So congratulations to them. Congratulations, commies.

[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:05.960]   You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:24.200]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:29.880]   Along a lonesome highway east of Omaha,
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:36.520]   you listen to the engine moaning out his one-o-song.
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:44.280]   You think about the woman, the girl you knew the night before.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:56.680]   But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:13.560]   Mr. Rounds, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Sass, Mr. Schatz, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Scott, Mrs. Shaheen,
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:24.760]   Mr. Shelby, Ms. Sinema, Mr. Smith, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Sullivan.
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:33.400]   [SOUND] That is the horrifying sound from our satellite feed directly in the House chambers
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:39.800]   of Nancy the swamp creature Pelosi. And we can't let's go back to that audio. Just keep it
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:44.200]   ambient in the background. >> Mr. Van, of Nancy the swamp creature Pelosi.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:47.960]   >> Is Warren. >> About to be sworn in after they do this
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.560]   roll call. >> Mr. Wicker.
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:58.120]   >> In front of Congress as the new Speaker of the House. And then you can get ready for the 84 and
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:09.400]   more that are starting out 84 new investigations that they plan to launch against President Trump
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.840]   and the American recovery in our attempt to take our nation back from the globalist.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:20.120]   And we've seen draconian on American censorship. We've seen big tech openly moving to China.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:24.280]   We've seen the total sellout of our civilization.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:40.440]   Now, if we cannot get the narrative out to the public that we're fighting just to get control
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:44.360]   of our country from the globalist, we'll lose the fight with the globalist.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:50.680]   I know it's not fun to admit we've been taken over, but they're even to the point of sexualizing our
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:57.320]   children and doing things that adults would be called perverts as parents. If you were
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.840]   trying to tell your child at age five, they were another gender.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:06.040]   If you were reading them books about men having sex together or men and women having sex together,
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:09.240]   you would be called a weird pervert sexualizer of your child.
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:20.040]   But now they have Desmond the Amazing,
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:29.320]   who's all over national TV the last four or five years, who's now 11, who goes to gay strip clubs
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:35.480]   to dance on stage and have men throw a child money while he's dressed like a girl shaking his butt.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:42.520]   And the news praises it and then not in one, not in two, but in postings all over now we're finding.
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:49.720]   Why is Desmond so amazing? He looks drugged out of his mind.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:54.120]   Let's show some of the other photos. Just type in the amazing Desmond or Desmond Amazing
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.640]   and click Google images and he or show the videos we're showing today.
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:04.360]   He's talking about snorting ketamine. There's posters behind him talking about date rape,
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:15.880]   rohibinol, amnesic drugs used in orgies. And this is what we put up with this poor little
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:20.600]   abused child in my view, up there. We showed some of the videos the other day
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:27.640]   of the transformation. That's him a couple of years ago. Let's show the particular new videos.
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:31.720]   Yeah, that's some of the new stuff up there in the left hand corner. Some of the videos that
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:38.040]   you showed the other day. One is with him with two adult gay men with the word rohibinol behind him,
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:43.560]   rubies, roofies. And then there's the other video of him talking about LGBTP.
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:49.400]   And then there, I mean, look at him. He looks like he can barely open his eyes there. Look how
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:53.640]   bombed out of his poor little brain. And there's a poster
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:59.080]   about rohibinol with a little boy jumping rope, dressed like a girl.
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:04.360]   So here they are sitting on a couch, two adult men with an 11 year old boy
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.360]   who looks like he's drugged out of his mind.
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:19.560]   And there is images of children skipping rope. And it says roofie under it or rohibinol.
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:26.920]   And then there's open paintings that this artist sells about rohibinol. Let's go to,
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.600]   we'll get back to this in a moment. Let's go to the vice president,
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:35.400]   Mike Pence, set to swear in Nancy Pelosi. This is the dark days we're facing. Here it is.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:40.200]   - In the previous order, the leadership time is reserved and the Senate will be in a period
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:46.040]   of morning business with senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:50.760]   - Mr. President. - Jordy Lee.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:54.920]   - I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the consideration of S.R.E.S. 1,
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:58.600]   submitted earlier today. - Clerk will report the resolution.
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:03.160]   - Senate resolution 1, informing the president of the United States that a quorum of each house
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:06.680]   is assembled. - Is there objection to proceeding
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.920]   to the measure? - Without objection,
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:13.320]   the Senate will proceed to the measure. - I ask unanimous consent the resolution
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:17.000]   be agreed to and the motion reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.760]   with no intervening action or debate. - Without objection.
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.920]   - Pursuant to Senate resolution 1, the chair appoints the senator.
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:29.320]   - And again, this is obviously the Senate swearing in. It's been bouncing back and
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:34.360]   forth the satellites. We've got the house going as well. So we'll watch that as it all unfolds.
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:43.720]   Okay, let's go back to where we were. You've got the amazing Desmond, whom I see all of the news,
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:47.800]   just how wonderful it is. And he's the example and your kids should do it too. And he goes to
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:52.120]   schools and talks to kids about how you can change your sex. You can go dance at gay clubs and
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:58.280]   they have the adult, quote, drag queens there to teach the kids at career day.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:02.280]   This is a great decision for you as young as age five. And this is what's going on.
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:09.320]   Children looking drugged out of their minds with paintings behind them celebrating Rohibonol.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:14.440]   And everybody in this photo, if you're watching or the video,
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:18.920]   looks like they've been taking something like Rohibonol, the date rape drug, the amnesia.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:28.200]   Now let's continue. You then again have him in videos talking about how LGBTP,
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:37.160]   everybody's in the club. And then talking about snorting ketamine off of his wrist and getting
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:46.360]   high. And the poor little thing looks like he's about to die. He's being sacrificed by the evil
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:52.280]   system. And I predict he'll be dead on the current course by the time he's 16. And they'll say,
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:59.080]   poor little amazing Desmond. Everyone was so mean to him. Everybody was so bad to him
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:07.880]   for so long because of his trans nature. He committed suicide. It'll be a drug overdose.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:14.520]   You know, the group that dies the youngest of suicide, of drug overdose, of being actually
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:19.080]   abused, not by the heterosexual community, but by whatever you call this community,
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:24.520]   are the trans community. And they get kids, they convince them to have their testicles removed
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:30.040]   or to be chemically castrated and then to go into a lifestyle that, man, I was in some regular
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:35.400]   topless bars, some in college and didn't like them and got drugged to them a few times.
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:39.800]   You know, after I'd be at some comedy club or something, oh, let's go to this restaurant. And
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:42.280]   you know, you're in another city and you walk in and it's a topless bar.
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:49.640]   And I just couldn't wait to get out of them because there's just, it just, it just feels
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:56.280]   plastic. And I'm not judging everybody that goes to them. But man, can you imagine walking into
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:00.280]   one of these and there's an 11 year old little boy up there dressed like a girl shaking his butt and
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:05.560]   he looks bombed out of his brain and then that's on TV as a good thing. And then it's all over the
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:10.200]   country it's being done. You see, if the globalists can't abort our children,
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:16.760]   if the globalists can't get that done, they are going to try to
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:22.600]   destroy them outside the womb and destroy the reproductivity because men are who can fight
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:29.080]   tyranny and the powerful alpha males in control just like a lion will kill the dominant male
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:36.600]   cub because they want to get rid of the competition.
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:42.520]   It's the same thing. That's what this whole situation is. Celebrating the drugging and
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:48.120]   having sex with children in your face and the government run schools now a conduit
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:52.520]   to strike your children dead with this lightning. We'll be right back with the
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:56.840]   open celebration of abortion in the schools in children's TV shows.

[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:52.280]   That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:58.840]   Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:08.280]   You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:20.120]   >>
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:30.280]   When you think about how evil the Democratic Party is and how they represent the globalist.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:35.560]   And how we're so close to taking the Republican Party away from the globalist blue bloods.
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:42.360]   It makes my heart skip a beat really. Nancy Pelosi is being worshipped right now live on C-SPAN.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:49.000]   As they're preparing to have the vote to then move towards her being sworn in.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:54.920]   And to watch the fawning and groveling during the break and to know how truly corrupt and evil
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:48:02.280]   these Democrat big city regimes are, makes my head spin. But the good news is
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:09.880]   people are voting with their feet. And the biggest exodus in the country is out of beautiful Vermont.
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:18.840]   It was once totally conservative like Texas 50 years ago. And now Vermont is worse than San Francisco,
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:27.400]   but they're having record exodus out. Because almost everyone is sick of living under the
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:34.520]   oppression. And of course, New York is trying to say Trump's the reason people are leaving New York.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:39.960]   No, they're leaving because of you Cuomo who said if you're a Christian, or you're anti-abortion,
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:44.040]   or you're a gun owner, you're not welcome. Said if you're a Christian conservative,
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:50.200]   you're not welcome in New York. You're like, that's a crazy statement. No, that's who he is.
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:56.520]   Just like he said, America was never that great. And it'll never be great, close quote.
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:05.160]   America was never that great. It'll never be great until the socialism.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:11.160]   That's the quote. That's the quote.
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:17.720]   If you understand this, these are the people hired by globalists to bring the country down.
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:25.480]   This is who they are. This is what they do. They told Trump, he's bad to say we even have a nation,
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:29.080]   every channel. Remember Don Lemon? I have to apologize if you're just having to hear that.
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:32.040]   He just said nationalist and nation state.
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:40.040]   In fact, yeah, let's hear Cuomo. Then let's go to this live feed in the House of Representatives
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:44.760]   where the enemy by massive fraud was able to get control of the House and now has
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:52.680]   84 investigations, none of them to do with Russia, of the president and his family,
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:58.920]   the golf courses, everything, going back 50 years to Fred Trump. And then he set up tax
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:07.400]   systems with trust funds for his kids. That's what everybody does.
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:11.480]   People make $100,000 a year set up trust for their kids.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:20.520]   And you sure better set it all up by the time you die. You better give it all away to somebody or
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:26.680]   they're gonna hit you with that death tax. Which again, the globalists all avoid. The ones always
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:31.160]   calling for higher taxes pay almost no taxes. They all go to Congress with no money. They
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:36.360]   become billionaires like Nancy Pelosi and her crime dynasty and her disgusting family.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:44.360]   And I say that because they're always on my butt. She is a thug. She'll kill the First Amendment
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:48.280]   just as sure as the sun came up. Hell, they've already done a pretty good job. Here, let's hear
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:57.720]   some of this babble. >> He knows government is not the source of
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:03.400]   our liberty. Rather, it is instituted among men and women to secure our liberty.
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:10.760]   Leader McCarthy has led us through the 115th Congress in unmatched historic productivity,
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:15.400]   including passage of the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Because we know.
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:24.840]   >> We know, Madam Clerk, that the American people know better than the government how
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:28.200]   to spend their money. >> That's the Republican speaking.
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:31.880]   When you hear the Democrats speak, it's literally like hearing a lobotomized-
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.760]   >> Leader McCarthy led us in passage of the Support Act, providing important-
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.000]   >> Let's go back to what I was hitting on. >> To help address the-
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.720]   >> Because we've got Nancy Pelosi green lighting that they won't rule out
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:45.720]   trying to indict Trump or impeach Trump, as if they even have the power to indict.
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:51.560]   But that's her using the term of the House, moving for impeachment is the indictment,
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:57.240]   then the Senate would have the trial. Which is so critical that Trump had a large majority
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:01.000]   of the Senate, which they did get a better majority, but not a large majority.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.800]   So that's why this whole thing is hit and miss, especially with Ruth Bader Ginsburg preparing to
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:11.880]   make the jump into hyperspace. But remember Pelosi's daughter warns Trump, my mommy will
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:16.200]   cut your head off and you won't even know you're bleeding, kinda like you've done to America.
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:19.640]   Or how about all those little kids that get their heads cut off?
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:25.240]   #ShoutYourAbortionFounder, how about we #AlexJones? They hate that on Twitter.
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:31.160]   They can ban me, but they can't ban #AlexJones. #ShoutYourAbortionFounder
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:37.320]   indoctrinates kids in cringe-worthy propaganda video. Yeah, you've seen the videos where Gloria
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:41.320]   Steinem says how great it is to get an abortion and how fun it is. And then women getting abortions
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:46.600]   about how good it feels. Now how it's empowering. I'll spare you playing those videos again, but
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:50.600]   this is a new one. In a tweet advertising her coming children's book on abortion,
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:56.040]   how about children's books on abortion? Not a children's book about butterflies or fishing or
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:01.720]   grandma and grandpa or about the big bad wolf predators like this lady. No, no, it's a story
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:05.960]   about how wonderful it is. In a tweet advertising her coming children's book on abortion,
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:13.240]   Bo now shared the propaganda video saying I'll let a bunch of kids grill me about my abortion and it
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:19.160]   was great. Here, let's play some of the video. This is what's force fed, directed at children
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.560]   on YouTube. Here it is. >> When you have an abortion,
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:26.600]   what exactly do you do to like have the abortion? >> You go to the doctor and they
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:33.880]   put this little straw inside of your cervix and then inside of your uterus.
[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:39.560]   And then they just suck the pregnancy out. And it was like a crappy dentist appointment or
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:45.240]   something. It was just like, this is like a body thing that's kind of uncomfortable. But
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:51.160]   then it was over and I felt really just grateful that I wasn't pregnant anymore.
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:58.360]   >> I've gone into many an internet argument about it, Facebook, Instagram, just all the social
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:53:59.480]   media. >> That's the place where that goes down.
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:02.920]   >> It's so taboo to a lot of folks and I don't know why.
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:06.120]   >> Do you think that sometimes it's not okay to have an abortion?
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:11.240]   >> I wanna say if you're being reckless, if there's nothing wrong going on.
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:18.760]   >> I don't know, I just don't agree. Do we want people to just have all those babies?
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:21.320]   >> No. >> So what do we do with them?
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:24.040]   >> Put them up for adoption. >> I feel like if-
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:28.040]   >> She's here talking to the black kid, the main target of abortions blacks.
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:29.960]   He's like, man, I don't think we ought to be doing this. He's like,
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:37.000]   oh yeah, we're gonna be doing it. Boy, the message. You gotta understand the average white
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:42.360]   person who's a liberal are the racist. I know them, I run into them. They are monstrous people.
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:47.880]   So here's this spider creeping over the black kid trying to normalize abortion to him, here it is.
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:56.280]   >> I am forced to create life. I have lost the right to my own life. I should be the one to
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:55:03.000]   decide if my body creates life. Even if you're giving a kid up for adoption, still have a kid
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.280]   out there somewhere. >> Yeah.
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:08.280]   >> Are you religious at all? >> I believe in God.
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:11.240]   >> What do you think that God thinks about abortion?
[00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:13.240]   >> Let's stop right here, I can't watch any more of this.
[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:18.920]   What is YouTube doing kicking all the Christians and conservatives and Franklin
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:23.880]   Graham being kicked off Facebook? But then they've got all these new shows we played
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:28.920]   where they teach little Asian kids that whites are inherently bad and that communism is good.
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:35.160]   And then it's some rich Hollywood person producing it. It's all total division.
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:40.120]   And these people are obsessed with your children. Just like earlier, I covered the video
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:46.840]   of the amazing Desmond, obviously bombed out of his brain on drugs, talking about ketamine and
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:53.800]   roofies with grown men and transvestites all over him. Poor little thing, where are the police
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:56:00.760]   investigations? But see, he's a little boy, so it's like toughen up. We're gonna give you hormones
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:06.760]   to sterilize you and some ketamine. Toughen up, get up there on stage and dance. But if this was
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:11.240]   a little girl, which I agree we should do something, the SWAT team would have been there that
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:17.480]   night. Can you imagine at a gay or straight strip club having an 11-year-old that they advertised
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:23.240]   for weeks and sold $15 tickets? Now in the articles we wrote about this, there were a lot of the quote
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:28.520]   gay men who went on Facebook and said, I saw this a week ago, I'm still shaken up by it.
[00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:34.920]   There's no place for children. Yeah, not in a straight bar, that's a dance bar,
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:41.640]   not in a gay bar anywhere. We all know this, but you look at the artwork of who the amazing
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:51.080]   Desmond is hanging out with, zombie girl jumping rope, zombie girl with some type of drugs,
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:58.520]   toucan Sam with pills, rohibonol, demon baby. And then the child is hanging around in videos
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:03.800]   with the demon baby, pictures behind him. It's all about we are going to corrupt your children.
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:08.080]   Corrupt the child, destroy them all. >>
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:16.440]   Now as you've noticed, I've gotten so busy this hour that I haven't even plugged products
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:19.720]   or services that our advertisers have at infowarestore.com.
[00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:24.360]   And if I don't do that, we won't be here, but you've really come through and supported us.
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:28.200]   So it's not a gimmick when I keep saying like yesterday, today's the last day of the four
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:34.440]   wide free shipping, free gift, 75% off, blah, blah, blah. I've been so busy, I haven't got new ads.
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:39.880]   So this must absolutely be the last day at infowarestore.com, but then it will end
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:44.040]   because we're selling out of everything. Infowarestore.com,
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:46.520]   get the very best supplements at the best prices and more.
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:53.240]   >> Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:58.840]   Infowars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives,
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:03.480]   the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate. People say,
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:06.760]   why would you start a fight with them? Because they were already dominating and
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:11.160]   running America into the ground. And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:16.760]   So we've already had incredible success. But if you will simply realize how epic this is,
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:21.000]   and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.320]   And if you financially support us, if you spread the word about our articles and videos,
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:31.320]   infowars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:37.000]   We have huge sales at infowarsstore.com right now. And we're still able to operate the shopping cart
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.080]   and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:45.720]   to the market. But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globus may win.
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:48.840]   This is Infowars' Darcus Howard, we need your support, I'm counting on you.
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:54.520]   Please, whatever you do realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:58.280]   And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with Infowars. Yes,
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:01.960]   some of them are like little side accounts. They know we had like Infowars store that
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:06.760]   just showed our products. But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:11.320]   a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us. Your excitement about America,
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:14.680]   your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:19.960]   the break. But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:26.760]   pesky in the future. I want to be troublesome and pesky. I want to keep going. I want to make them
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:32.120]   do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially. I want to push all the way. I've committed to do
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:36.520]   that. I've prayed for that. And I've been told that's going to happen. But you've got to back
[00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:42.040]   us and I promise you this, I will never falter. I will never waver at the spiritual level. I
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:46.440]   physically will. But I give you my commitment. If you financially support us, then for sure,
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:56.360]   I come to give you my absolute total commitment. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.000]   [Music]
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:03.320]   [Music]
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:33.080]   That's right, folks, the dark side of the moon, the Chai Koms have landed a probe there.
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:40.200]   I believe they've gone there. I believe I can jump on an airplane in 16 hours and be in Tokyo,
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:47.400]   Japan too. I can also go to the store and buy a rifle that at a thousand yards I can shoot
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:53.640]   antelope with without even looking at the site. Yes, you can shoot cruise missiles down your
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:01:01.960]   chimney in 1970. And we can land on the dark side of the moon. Just took the Chai Koms longer than
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:11.720]   30 years. First got what 1969, do the math, 30, 40, 48 years. Holy guacamole, Batman.
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:20.040]   But let's get focused here. I just played clips of what airs on television and what airs on
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:24.520]   YouTube and what gets force fed to children, teaching them how great it is to have abortions
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:27.320]   and how it's no big deal and how it makes you feel great to get one.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:35.160]   Shout your abortion isn't trying to be woke. These women say they're trying to expand perception.
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:47.240]   Isn't that nice? And I remember Dr. Spock, he, not Dr. Spock of the USS Enterprise and Captain Kirk,
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:51.080]   you know, the Dr. Spock that taught everybody from the sixties on, don't ever tell your kids
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:55.080]   what to do. Don't ever tell them their identity. Let the state tell them what to do.
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:02:01.800]   And so now you don't tell your children any ideas or any of your values. You just let whatever failed
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:06.680]   comedian wants to come in and sexualize your kids, medicalize your children, come in and do that.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:13.720]   And I was thinking about Sandusky raping hundreds and hundreds of children. And when he finally got
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:20.840]   busted at Penn State, he was in the field house on a Saturday. Now you have to understand college
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:27.320]   football plays football on Saturday in the field house at the, in the middle of the day, having
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:35.240]   sex with an underage. It was, I think the kid was like 10 years old, raping him. Can we put a mug
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:41.960]   shot of Sandusky up? And it turned out that the head of the school covered it up and Pertone covered
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:45.880]   it up. Well, yeah, folks, I know people that live up that neck of the woods by the DuPonts.
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:51.560]   And let me tell you, if you want to find a place, it's got more devil worship than San Francisco
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:59.960]   or Washington, DC. There's one place and that's Penn State. By the way, Trump went there
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:03.480]   to the business school, Wharton business. I'm not saying to strike against him.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:09.640]   I got good friends that went to Penn State, but I'm just saying, let me tell you something.
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:16.440]   If there is a pedophile command base, baby, I found no evidence of Trump and pedophilia.
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:19.880]   The media tried to say that it's not true. The Clintons, the rest of it, it's huge,
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:24.520]   but he did go to Wharton business school there. But you shake a stick in the dark.
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:31.320]   In Penn State, baby, you are running into not just molesting.
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:43.560]   So people sit there and they ask the question, how in the hell all over the country do they
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:47.880]   have young boys dressed up like girls as young as 10 in cases we've seen
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:57.400]   dancing provocatively, scantily clad to men in a nightclub where people dance naked,
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:06.680]   shaking their ass and getting money? Well, because we live in a world where Mr. Sandusky,
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:14.360]   why would Sandusky choose to not rape the little, what was it, a nine-year-old boy
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:21.720]   in his office? He had his house by a local elementary school playground. Very creepy.
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:27.800]   Because you have to understand, to these people doing it, and see, you always hear about Satanist,
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:30.760]   they're taking over the Vatican, having sex in the churches. It's come out.
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:36.760]   Thousands of priests in Pennsylvania, again, up to 10, 15 priests raping little boys
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:43.080]   inside the church at night, reproducing the Holy Sacrament, the Eucharist, because it's called
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:49.880]   blasphemy. That's what you do in the real satanic Bible on Antioch. The real ones is you go and you
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:55.720]   do blood rituals in the church and you blaspheme Christ. This is called devil worship.
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:03.480]   - We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue. InfoWars is proud to

[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:44.480]   Well, ladies and gentlemen, the day of doom is here, if they have their way. 84 fake investigations,
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:48.320]   none of it Russiagate, coming out of the Democrat-controlled House. Nancy Pelosi,
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:51.600]   they're having the vote to ensconce her in the House of Representatives
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:54.800]   right now, and then she'll be sworn in. Let's go to some of that audio.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.000]   Costa.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.280]   Pelosi.
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.680]   Courtney.
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.840]   Pelosi.
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:06.960]   Cox of California.
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.680]   Nancy Pelosi.
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:10.320]   Pelosi.
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:12.640]   Craig.
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:16.320]   A lot of Pelosi's in the House.
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:19.040]   Crawford.
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.760]   We're going to go back to him in a moment with her being sworn in.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.080]   Crenshaw.
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:30.960]   But first, I've asked the crew to look into the amazing Desmond, or Desmond the Amazing,
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:35.360]   he's known as both ways, who since he was five, six, seven years old, I've seen on the national
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:43.760]   news, as a little boy that identifies as a girl, and who now performs at gay strip clubs
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:52.960]   for $15 a head. Now, as we noticed, he's promoted to schoolchildren around the country. There's been
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:57.760]   a new development we were covering this last hour. As you know, a few weeks ago, he performed at this
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:02.480]   club. People said it's illegal to be in a bar for a child this age anyways. How is this going on?
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:06.960]   Where are the parents? Why is this being put up with?
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:13.600]   And then people started to notice that he's in another video with the drag queen,
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:18.240]   never with his biological parents. He just seems to be off with all these people. The big news is
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:25.120]   coming. The big new development. And there he is with these people talking about snorting
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:32.480]   ketamine, which is a drug you take to basically go into a trance for group sex. I mean, I've heard
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:36.640]   about it. I've read about it. Burning man, you name it. But it's a mind control drug. Well,
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:43.120]   now he looks very shriveled, very anorexic, very, he looks like a classic junkie. And he's being
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:49.120]   paraded around and passed around all these people that shoot videos and talk about LGBT,
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:55.200]   putting the pedophile on the end, and you talk about snorting the ketamine. And in the new video,
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:59.280]   there's a poster by an artist behind him talking about children taking rohibinol.
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:02.800]   And you go to the artist website. It's all about demons and death. But it gets better.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:10.960]   Look at this from Wikipedia. Michael Alig, who this young boy is with in the latest video
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:16.080]   about rohibinol. In March of 96, Alig and his roommate, Robert D. Freeze Riggs,
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:24.000]   killed fellow club kid, Andre Angel Melendez in a confrontation over a delinquent drug debt.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.360]   Oh, no wonder. So this is a convicted, wait to hear. In October 97, Alig pled guilty to
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:33.120]   first degree manslaughter. Both men were sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison.
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:41.680]   Riggs was released on parole in 2010. Alig on May 5, 2014 for dismembering the young gay man.
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:50.320]   Now, where is the amazing Desmond? Where is the, well, he's with these guys.
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:56.960]   We're going to play some of that video in a moment. But first, let's play the video from
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:02.560]   last week that made national news where he's with the drag queen with green hair,
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:07.680]   talking about snorting hardcore mind control drugs. Here it is.
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:11.680]   >> Was right. >> See.
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:19.920]   >> Belen Dolce, putting the P in LGBT P plus. You should eat some foods, little nibba.
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:22.880]   >> I don't know what that means. But I'm getting hate comments. Does this mean I'm famous now?
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:30.240]   >> Is this what he wants? Lots of respect for you guys. Thank you. Press G to gas. G, G, G, G.
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:36.240]   One, two, three, four Gs. What has this world come to?
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:38.640]   It's come to a world where drag kids actually exist.
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:44.480]   >> And people do ketamine on a couch. >> How old is your BF? Hello?
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:45.760]   >> Yeah. >> Hitler was right.
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:51.360]   Helicopter rides, yay. >> Now it's a long YouTube video.
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:54.800]   There's an hour of it. You wanna go see more stuff? I don't know all the code words and stuff.
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:58.160]   People are freaking out over this, okay? Cuz it's code word city.
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:02.400]   We don't think code word about LGBTP or ketamine passing out on the couch with a kid.
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:06.800]   Little kid with another man dressed up like a woman. Where's mom and dad? They're normally on
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:12.080]   ABC News. How great they are, how great parents they are. We've got all that. It's truly insane.
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:20.080]   Now, here's the next video. Here he is on another couch with Michael Aling and another man
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:24.640]   with an image of a child jumping rope, talking about Rufus or Rohibonol.
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:28.240]   If you're a TV viewer, we'll go ahead and roll that video. But-
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:30.240]   >> Roof it. >> Yeah, let's go ahead and
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.800]   roll the audio too, go ahead. >> Two hour traffic to get here.
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:36.640]   >> Hot, hot, hot, hot tea. >> It's 9.40 PM and he doesn't
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:37.840]   have to go to school tomorrow. >> Yeah.
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:42.880]   >> So here they are reading to him about kids not having to go to school, do whatever they want.
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:49.200]   And again, there's all this drug paraphernalia words around. And it's with a man who pled guilty
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:55.280]   to chopping another man up. Now, where are the parents? You have a child that looks totally
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:00.400]   drugged out, who's performing at adult gay bars with men throwing money at him, talking about
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:07.920]   using drugs and celebration of children using drugs all over the walls, looking like he can
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:10.240]   hardly talk. >> Starving.
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:14.880]   >> Well, we should introduce you, explain to the viewers who Desmond is. Desmond is the world's
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:19.440]   youngest club kid. And we challenge you as the people out there to find a younger club kid.
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:22.720]   Will they find one? >> He's the youngest club kid. A club kid
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:28.800]   is the name for a 17, 18 year old young man who they allow to slip into gay bars
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:36.000]   to have sex illegally underage. But now you're the youngest club kid, you are 11.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:42.240]   And you're with a guy who's only spent a few years in jail, cuz he's gay, it's okay,
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.480]   for murdering someone, chopping them up, named Michael Ehrlich.
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:51.760]   And this is what the Democratic Party stands for. This is who they are.
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:55.840]   This is who they wanna be. And as we dig deeper into Michael Ehrlich,
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:01.200]   I'm sure of it now, I wanna make a documentary about the amazing Desmond.
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:07.280]   What he's doing, where he lives. I wanna go to the police and present this in his town and say
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:15.600]   what in the hell, it's New York City, have you people done? You have a minor being passed around
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:22.960]   by people to make YouTube videos about being the youngest club kid with convicted murderers.
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:29.600]   And people talking about mind control drugs with them. And the child looks like, I mean,
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:33.760]   if I got pulled over driving down the road at high noon and I looked like that kid,
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:39.040]   not the eye shadow, all that crap. If you look at those drug dyes, if you look at how
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:45.200]   the latest photos of him, he's so skinny. It tears your guts out.
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:52.960]   So you remember that this kid is celebrated everywhere. And he's been handed down through
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:57.840]   the spider hole and looks totally freaked out and totally scared if you really look at him.
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:02.240]   And then he's under Stockholm syndrome and keeps nodding his head like he's gonna fall down
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:04.880]   and just looks totally exhausted and totally freaked out.
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:12.000]   Oh my God, he's there with a murderer that chopped another man up that looks completely psychotic.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:18.240]   But it's okay cuz it's gay and it's trendy. And this is the left in America. This is who you are.
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:23.280]   Here, let's see our Lord and Savior Nancy Pelosi, who's getting a bunch of forced abortion money
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:26.600]   passed through the new budget. Let's go see these scum celebrating all this.
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:40.800]   Georgia, McCarthy, graves of Louisiana, McCarthy, graves of Missouri, McCarthy,
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:44.960]   Green of Tennessee.
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:48.160]   >> All right, we're gonna go to break. I'm gonna come back with really critical news
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:50.960]   that I'm not gonna get to till I get to it, but I'm gonna cover it when we come back.
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:56.320]   I wanna just put the bookend on this. I am predicting that this poor young boy,
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:02.000]   if he's not saved soon by the police and proper authorities going through the channels,
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:07.120]   that this poor little boy has been paraded around on national television by the whole
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:13.760]   New York crime syndicate will end up either having a drug overdose or dying or committing suicide
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:17.840]   because he's passed around with convicted murderers and put on stage at gay clubs
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:22.320]   to have money thrown at him and is in a drug culture talking about snorting ketamine
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:28.560]   and talking about rohibonol and just all of this in your face with him now with a convicted
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:34.640]   murderer who chopped another man to pieces in a drug deal.
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:40.400]   And he's here talking about drugs with a little kid and he's a convicted murderer.
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:44.960]   Hey, but you're a tough little boy. I mean, little girl, suck it up, kid.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.280]   Suck it up and get in there with the murderers and the rohibonol and the ketamine and the gay clubs.
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:55.520]   Suck it up, boy. Suck it up. That's what they're gonna make him do.
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:03.360]   The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:08.400]   George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of Empire
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:14.320]   shows that World Wars One and Two left England broken. Its former colony, the US,
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:20.320]   had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with

[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:33.840]   the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS and won. I beat
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:38.160]   the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement,
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:42.000]   and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:02.720]   The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:08.880]   halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ. It literally dumbs the
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:14.320]   population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world,
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:19.600]   we've gone through two permutations. First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good,
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:24.080]   but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it. So we discovered
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:28.880]   deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:34.560]   Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:39.440]   the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:45.040]   research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C,
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:51.680]   it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable. Ladies and gentlemen, you want
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:56.480]   to research it, you want to see it. It's an incredible discovery. X3, now available at
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:20:05.280]   mforwardslife.com. You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:32.080]   [Music]
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:38.960]   We're dealing with a nightmare situation, ladies and gentlemen. We are falling down a fetid,
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:46.080]   stinking spider hole at the bottom of which lie children that the globalist death state was unable
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:50.800]   to abort when they were in their mother, was unable to kill with tainted vaccines, was unable
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:58.080]   to scramble their brains. So instead, what we're dealing with here is children told that they're
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:04.640]   another gender or that genders don't exist. And then leftist parents going on national television
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:09.280]   like Good Morning America and being celebrated. We'll roll some of that for TV viewers in the
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:16.320]   background. And then the child's parents being hailed as these wonderful, wonderful people. Now
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:23.520]   there is Desmond is Amazing a few years ago. We rolled video earlier where he looks like he is on
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:29.360]   heroin. And guess who's he's hanging out with? We just noticed this from a movie called Party
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:36.400]   Monster, a documentary that one of the crew remembered that he hangs out with Michael Ehrlich,
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:44.720]   who is a convicted murderer who shevered a quote party kid into multiple pieces and pled guilty for
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:50.960]   it and only served a few years in prison. Well, now Desmond is Amazing is hanging out with him
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:56.320]   with posters in the background with the word Rohibonol or the date rape drug. And then in
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:01.200]   other videos, Desmond is Amazing talks about snorting ketamine on his arm. And lo and behold,
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:07.120]   I don't even know people already knew this. Desmond and the killer, the American conservative
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:14.720]   has a whole breakdown on this and how he the child works in gay clubs, having men throw money at him.
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:20.800]   11 years old. And this even violates child labor, violates liquor laws. But it's New York City.
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:26.000]   It's OK if your kid's hanging around with a guy that dismembers people. You can go on Good Morning
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:32.160]   America and say how cute it is and how fun it is. This is how sick Hollywood and the left is. And
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:42.080]   they have the souls of these destroyed children. On. Their evil, wicked hands. Oh, and guess what?
[01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:49.280]   If you look deeper into all of this, we looked into it. Both parents remain unemployed. Let's
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:56.880]   show for TV viewers the father. What a creepy, creepy, creepy, creepy, crawly that guy looks like,
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:03.040]   you know, kind of looks like Brian Stelter, doesn't he? I mean, he's got the look. And then
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:10.000]   there's a mommy. There's mommy over there. You just had it on screen. There they are. Boy,
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:16.480]   and they're unemployed. Don't they need to have their finances looked into? Don't they look into?
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:21.200]   Well, I mean, he goes in. It's 15 dollars a head for, quote, gay men to come see their son dress
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:26.720]   like a girl, dance and have money thrown at him. So how much are they making? No, I don't think
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:33.440]   they're unemployed. They're pimping their young son out. That's the definition when you send your
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:39.200]   child to a gay club and it's all allowed. And now I guess what you rent him out is that is this how
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:45.040]   that works to all this famous drag queen to get some attention on YouTube or to this famous killer,
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:52.400]   Michael Aylig, who is super famous in the whole pedophile investigation system online.
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:55.920]   His name just keeps popping up. That's how the crew remembered him.
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:24:02.160]   They said that guy's name, it seems familiar. And there he is on the video telling little.
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:11.120]   Boy, you're the youngest club kid ever. Well, what happened to the other club kid? In March of 96,
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:16.480]   Aylig and his roommate, Robert D. Freeze Riggs, killed fellow club kid Andre Angel
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:25.440]   Melendez in a confrontation over a delinquent drug debt. In October 97, Aylig pled guilty to
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:30.160]   first degree manslaughter. Both men are sentenced to 10, 20 years in prison. Riggs was released
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:40.960]   on parole in 2010. Aylig on May 5th, 2014. And let's pull up the definition of a club kid.
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:44.880]   From Urban Dictionary. We got an Urban Dictionary and type in definition club kid.
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:54.640]   Definition club kid, desperate, drugged out, young gay men, many of them underage in their
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:25:00.320]   shelling themselves. There it is. Hell from Wikipedia. While working,
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:06.080]   Aylig studied the nightclub business and soon became a party promoter. His ability to stage
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:10.480]   memorable parties helped him rise in New York's party scene. During that time, Aylig and other
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:16.560]   regular club goers began creating flamboyant personas that later became known as club kids.
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:22.640]   And the club kids wore outrageous costumes that former club kid and celebritante or
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:31.920]   James St. James later described as part drag, part clown, part infantilism. What is in it?
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:36.160]   I've got a big definition. I've got a big vocabulary, but what is infantilism?
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:43.120]   Infantilism. That's what I thought. I'm reading it from 20 feet away. Oh, acting like a baby.
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:50.160]   So you're a man that dresses like a girl, but also like a baby. Wonder who would be into that?
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:57.280]   Infantilism. I would be infantilist. So infantilism, not being infantile, but infantilism
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:04.800]   itself is being infantile. So there you go. Learn something every day. Oh, they're into going to gay
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:11.840]   clubs and acting like infants. Oh, and then they get into drugs. We're all learning this together
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:16.320]   and later become known as club kids. The club kids were outrageous costumes, club kids. And
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:22.080]   I've been saying these trannies are really clowns, which is it the clown, which goes back to ancient
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:26.560]   satanic rituals. People are like, yeah, you said this years ago, but here it is. I didn't even know
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:33.600]   the club kids were outrageous costumes like it the clown, former club kids later described part
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:40.240]   drag, part clown, part infantilism. They were also known to their frequent use of ketamine,
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:46.640]   known as special K ecstasy, rohebanol, heroin and cocaine. What did I say? This little kid,
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:51.280]   Desmond is amazing. Looks like I said, it looks like he's on heroin. He can barely hold his head
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:58.480]   up. A-legs club kids included among them. And then it goes on and then it goes on to say how
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:07.120]   they basically are children. Wow. Wow. In plain of view, national media worshiping a child that
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:15.440]   for years has been rented out by his parents, they admit. To gay bars, to dance provocatively
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:21.600]   for other men and the poor child is on TV talking about using ketamine and talking and other drugs.
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:28.080]   I mean, you talk about amazing and this is the big no, no. This is the big no, no. I've been told
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:33.040]   you don't talk about the scene in New York. I told you the whole pizza gate thing was a distract
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:40.240]   us off New York and the WikiLeaks on to the pizza parlor. Wow. The parents are unemployed. Let's
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:45.680]   show their house again. Let's look at that again. They're unemployed. Wonder what their tax returns
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:53.280]   show. Wonder how much money their son's bringing in. Wow. He'll be too old soon, I guess. So
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:28:00.800]   better get it. Oh, I bet they adopt. I bet that's coming next. I bet that's coming next. Oh my
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:06.800]   goodness. Isn't it fun? Now there he is at about age five, dressed up like a girl. Oh, it's so
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:11.760]   sweet. It's so cute. Hollywood. This is what they're doing to your children. This is what they
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:17.280]   continue to do to your children. And this just makes me absolutely flip out. And on national
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:21.360]   TV, it's not creepy enough to have JonBenét Ramsey, obviously pedophilic. That whole thing
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:25.280]   or getting killed. Obviously, those a lot of the child pageants are super creepy.
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:33.760]   But now it's a bunch of men and women leering at him, acting like a girl, dressing sexy and
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:40.560]   laying down with her legs partially open on the ground on national television. Desmond is amazing.
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:44.640]   Let's get all your kids into this and we can feed them right into the big rat hole,
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:49.600]   big spider hole. They can hang out with convicted killers that sever other gay men up and who
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:54.400]   invented this whole thing of acting infantile at gay clubs while other men have sex with you.
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:57.120]   Act like a baby while someone has sex with you. No big deal.

[01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:07.760]   Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZx formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:12.400]   As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to

[02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:15.840]   So, all over the western world, there is a coming out of the pedophiles sexualizing our children.
[02:00:15.840 --> 02:00:17.840]   They're really vampires.
[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:19.840]   They want their energy.
[02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:23.840]   We have an investigative journalist and actress who's been writing about it and exposing it.
[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:25.840]   Coming up, joining us in the next segment.
[02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:27.840]   So, please stay with us for that.
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:31.840]   But the next level of degeneracy taking over is here.
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:33.840]   We're now the underdogs.
[02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:35.840]   Franklin Graham's now the underdog.
[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:37.840]   Michael Savage is now the underdog.
[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:39.840]   Anyone telling the truth is now the underdog.
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:43.840]   And now it's bad to not want your child to hang out with convicted murderers.
[02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:47.840]   They're 11 years old and talk about how they're using ketamine and all the rest of it.
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:51.840]   Now, that's a beautiful, wonderful thing even though it's all illegal.
[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:55.840]   Meanwhile, this story is really important from Infowars.com.
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:59.840]   YouTube begins injecting direct links to CNN at top of search results.
[02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:05.840]   So, it's not enough that they feed CNN as the search result for everything news related at the top.
[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:07.840]   It's not the algorithm of what's popular anymore.
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:09.840]   There's going to be something with a thousand views versus a million.
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:11.840]   They'll put the globalist thing up top.
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:17.840]   Now, they put CNN links over the feed of everything I say, Trump says, or anybody else says.
[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:22.840]   This is big tech absolutely abusing everybody in a big way.
[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:24.840]   And then lying about it.
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:30.840]   Well, here's Sundar Pacharia lying to Congress saying they never change individual search results.
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:37.840]   And then we have all the links to Google executives, media executives, professors and others bragging how they routinely do it.
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:38.840]   Here it is.
[02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:44.840]   >> Manipulation of search results, I think it's important to talk about how search works.
[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:58.840]   Right now, if you Google the word idiot under images, a picture of Donald Trump comes up.
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:01:59.840]   I just did that.
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:01.840]   How would that happen?
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:05.840]   How does search work so that that would occur?
[02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:11.840]   >> We provide search today for any time you type in a keyword.
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:21.840]   We, as Google, we have crawled, we've gone out and crawled and stored copies of billions of web pages in our index.
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:29.840]   And we take the keyword and match it against web pages and rank them based on over 200.
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:31.840]   >> Back it up a few seconds.
[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:33.840]   That's how Google and every other search engine works.
[02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:38.840]   That's how the NSA would record your phone call and scan it, create a text and then be able to search the text.
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:44.840]   This is all NSA technology from 30 years ago, 35, 40 years ago.
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:48.840]   It's how voice print works, all of it.
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:58.840]   And now he's just telling her, oh, this is how we do it when they're on record doing nothing but positive results for Hillary, nothing but gaming, everything.
[02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:00.840]   Pelosi is about to be sworn in here.
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:01.840]   We'll go to that live in a moment.
[02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:04.840]   But let's just go back to Sundar lying to everyone.
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:05.840]   Here it is.
[02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:15.840]   >> Web pages and rank them based on over 200 signals, things like relevance, freshness, popularity, how other people are using it.
[02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:22.840]   And based on that, you know, at any given time, we try to rank and find the best results for that query.
[02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:25.840]   And then we evaluate.
[02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:27.840]   >> They just announced Pelosi the winner.
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:28.840]   So let's go back to Sundar.
[02:03:28.840 --> 02:03:29.840]   More lies.
[02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:31.840]   They never manipulate individual results.
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:34.840]   Total perjury before Congress.
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:36.840]   The Democrats, they run it, they don't care.
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:41.840]   And Google goes and buys them off for a few thousand dollars a year.
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:42.840]   Let's go back to Sundar.
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:47.840]   >> Behind the curtain, figuring out what we're going to show users.
[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:54.840]   Basically a compilation of what users are generating and trying to sort through that information.
[02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:57.840]   >> Last year we served over 3 trillion searches.
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:04.840]   And just as a fact, every single day, 15% of the searches Google sees, we have never seen them before.
[02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:05.840]   >> All right, pause again.
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:06.840]   >> So --
[02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:12.840]   >> Yeah, but with keywords like Alex Jones or Donald Trump, you have set feeds of what goes on top.
[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:15.840]   Until two years ago, all the top searches were me because we had the most views.
[02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:16.840]   It was our channel.
[02:04:16.840 --> 02:04:17.840]   It was set to that.
[02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:21.840]   The algorithm picked up that we were dominant in the name Alex Jones.
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:27.840]   It got reset to everything negative and you go to YouTube and type in Alex Jones and all you get is negative.
[02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:31.840]   Sundar, though, thinks you're all a big, fat moron.
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:38.840]   But go see Google employees, Google execs, professors in media bragging how they go in every day and control everything.
[02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:41.840]   And they read your personal messages, they read your e-mail, Twitter does it.
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:43.840]   They just abuse everyone.
[02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:46.840]   But they've already committed so many crimes, why not commit millions more?
[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:48.840]   Why not surveil you?
[02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:49.840]   Why not move to China?
[02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:50.840]   Why not suppress speech?
[02:04:50.840 --> 02:04:52.840]   Why not ban Franklin Graham?
[02:04:52.840 --> 02:04:53.840]   Why not?

[02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:44.840]   >> Well, Nancy Pelosi just got confirmed by the vote in the leadership for the House of Representatives to be the speaker.
[02:06:44.840 --> 02:06:56.840]   I didn't mean to go off into a two-hour breakdown of Desmond Naples off and on, but they've had his parents parading him around since he was in kindergarten when he openly decided he was gay.
[02:06:56.840 --> 02:06:59.840]   And now they've been unemployed, but he gets paid.
[02:06:59.840 --> 02:07:02.840]   I guess they make money off of it to dance at gay bars.
[02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:03.840]   That would be illegal for anybody else to do.
[02:07:03.840 --> 02:07:04.840]   It is illegal.
[02:07:04.840 --> 02:07:07.840]   Well, there's liquor sold and have money thrown at him.
[02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:16.840]   He talks in all these videos with famous murderers and founders of what they call club kids where they behave like babies in gay bars on drugs.
[02:07:16.840 --> 02:07:18.840]   He talks about ketamine on video.
[02:07:18.840 --> 02:07:21.840]   He talks about rohibonol.
[02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:30.840]   And it's all there, and then his parents are on national news being worshipped and being praised as the best people the planet has ever seen.
[02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:39.840]   I just thought I'd mention that because it's just so unspeakable that this is what the Democratic Party and everyone has signed on to.
[02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:45.840]   But Mindy Robinson is a Los Angeles-based actress and TV personality from Fault River.
[02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:50.840]   She has become a prolific character actor, accumulating 150 appearances on TV and film.
[02:07:50.840 --> 02:07:55.840]   Her improv skills gained exposure over 30 network reality shows as a personality.
[02:07:55.840 --> 02:08:00.840]   And her extensive work in independent film continues to add to her heavily diverse base.
[02:08:00.840 --> 02:08:11.840]   But really the reason we have her on is she has some great interviews on radio and TV and Twitter and Instagram at I Heart Mindy, Facebook at I Heart.
[02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:12.840]   We'll go over all that for you.
[02:08:12.840 --> 02:08:16.840]   RedWhiteandFU.com is her website.
[02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:22.840]   But I wanted to get her on because she's written some really powerful articles and has the courage to cover all of this.
[02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:27.840]   Because especially around Hollywood, you criticize the pedophilia and the sexualization of children.
[02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:28.840]   That is their mainstay.
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:30.840]   They really try to blackball you.
[02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:33.840]   The big article she wrote for RedWhiteandFU.
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:34.840]   There's no F-U-C.
[02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:38.840]   It's just RedWhiteandtheletterFU.com.
[02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:44.840]   There is a new movement by pedophiles that legalize all forms of virtual child porn.
[02:08:44.840 --> 02:08:46.840]   And they admit all this.
[02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:51.840]   So simulated child porn is now what they want to push.
[02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:55.840]   And we see Twitter, Facebook, YouTube actually have been caught pushing this, promoting it.
[02:08:55.840 --> 02:09:00.840]   And then if you try to expose the targeting of children, that's one of the things I got told.
[02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:02.840]   Leave Islamics alone.
[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:04.840]   Leave the pedophiles alone.
[02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:09.840]   And basically we'll leave you alone.
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:12.840]   So that's what we've created in this nation.
[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:17.840]   And so as we start the new year here, I really want to focus in on the children being targeted.
[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:22.840]   Also in the schools, not just with sexualization but with communism and with racial division.
[02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:23.840]   We've played those clips.
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:26.840]   Or with elementary students being told how great abortion is.
[02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:29.840]   This is not the school's place to be doing this, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:33.840]   So the left spent decades telling parents, don't be involved with your children.
[02:09:33.840 --> 02:09:35.840]   Let them figure it out for themselves.
[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:37.840]   That means let the state indoctrinate them.
[02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:40.840]   But now we know that folks that warned us were right.
[02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:43.840]   This is about the total takeover of children.
[02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:45.840]   And you may not have children.
[02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:46.840]   I have four.
[02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:52.840]   But if you'll just send these articles on to everyone you know that have children, you'll raise the alarm and go to city council.
[02:09:52.840 --> 02:09:54.840]   And speak about it.
[02:09:54.840 --> 02:10:01.840]   The power of you at the grassroots calling into C-SPAN, calling into talk radio, going and meeting with your congressmen and women.
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:03.840]   Getting involved will shake the world.
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:16.840]   And there's a graphic I'll actually pull up on my phone here in a moment that shows the amount of arrest of pedophiles and other child traffickers are up tenfold.
[02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:22.840]   They're up tenfold now, ladies and gentlemen, since Trump got in.
[02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:28.840]   I was just going to renew my children's passports and get the first passport for my 20-month-old.
[02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:31.840]   And before you go pay at an expediting place, you have all your proof and everything.
[02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:33.840]   And then they would go take care of it.
[02:10:33.840 --> 02:10:35.840]   No, now I don't do that.
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:39.840]   I go to the courthouse and I've got to actually be there and do the whole process.
[02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:40.840]   And that's actually a good thing.
[02:10:40.840 --> 02:10:42.840]   I was shocked at how easy it was before.
[02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:44.840]   Trump has ended all of that.
[02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:58.840]   So with the U.N. and all the child trafficking and with all the things that have been going on and the Catholic Church getting busted and the ordered cover-ups and the deputy pope trafficked over 100 children.
[02:10:58.840 --> 02:11:01.840]   The average person who isn't into this can't believe what's happening.
[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:08.840]   So we're kind of blindsided when it just all comes out in the open in a giant bum rush to get to our kids as soon as they can.
[02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:10.840]   And you're like, but it's reckless.
[02:11:10.840 --> 02:11:11.840]   It's crazy.
[02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:12.840]   It's nuts.
[02:11:12.840 --> 02:11:16.840]   These predators, ladies and gentlemen, want to destroy the energy and the innocence of your child.
[02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:20.840]   The demons controlling them is the best way to describe it are so hungry.
[02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:23.840]   They don't care about the flesh bag that gets them to your kids.
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:26.840]   They're uncontrollable monsters.
[02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:31.840]   And they're making their big Nambla move right now.
[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:34.840]   Mindy Robinson, thank you so much for joining us today.
[02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:36.840]   Hey, how are you doing?
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:38.840]   We're good.
[02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:40.840]   I mean, I followed you on YouTube and Facebook.
[02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:42.840]   And I think we've interviewed you a few times here before.
[02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:45.840]   I know some of the other shows you have, and I'm familiar with your work.
[02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:49.840]   But tackling this, living out in L.A., that takes a lot of huevos.
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:53.840]   Yeah, you know, I kind of walk the line between both worlds.
[02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:55.840]   I get to work in the industry.
[02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:58.840]   I'm an independent film, because Lord knows I'm blacklisted and everything else.
[02:11:58.840 --> 02:12:01.840]   And, you know, this is my background with politics and American history.
[02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:03.840]   And then I started talking about politics.
[02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:06.840]   And I kind of fell into exposing these pedophiles.
[02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:11.840]   It's not something normal people would know to look for, to think to look for.
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:14.840]   And I'm in a position where I don't have children.
[02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:18.840]   And a lot of people that try to do what I do with children, that's the first thing they do.
[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:19.840]   You know, they find your kids.
[02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:21.840]   They leave disgusting comments.
[02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:22.840]   They keep pictures.
[02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:23.840]   They do that kind of thing.
[02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:28.840]   I'm in a position where I'm lucky and unlucky enough to expose these pedophiles.
[02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:29.840]   And there are hundreds.
[02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:31.840]   I found hundreds just this week.
[02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:32.840]   And Twitter will not remove them.
[02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:33.840]   They can remove you.
[02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:34.840]   They can remove Laura Loomer.
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:38.840]   They can remove everyone they want that they don't--you know, whose opinions they don't like.
[02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:44.840]   But I'm flagging comments that say sex with children is okay, and Twitter won't pull them down.
[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:52.840]   Or even worse, they pretend to pull it down, and then it's back up in a day, you know, hoping we wouldn't notice, I guess, is their motivation.
[02:12:52.840 --> 02:13:04.840]   And then you tie this in with the total move against our children in the schools by groups literally founded by famous pedophiles.
[02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:06.840]   It's wild.
[02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:10.840]   Yeah, you know, I used to think the indoctrination of our youth started in college.
[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:11.840]   I had to avoid it.
[02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:14.840]   You know, I had to take those mandatory bullshit classes.
[02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:16.840]   And it started much younger than that.
[02:13:16.840 --> 02:13:20.840]   I mean, they're teaching your kids this awful stuff.
[02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:28.840]   I don't think parents are fully aware, and I think they need to either not let their children online or go through absolutely everything.
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:30.840]   I mean, did you see some of these profiles?
[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:31.840]   These are necrophiliacs.
[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:35.840]   These are people that are into molesting babies and toddlers.
[02:13:35.840 --> 02:13:38.840]   These are soulless gobs--and it's crazy.
[02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:40.840]   They're all leftists.
[02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:49.840]   I mean, it's not that I don't think that there are child molesters on the right, but these people are on Mountain Top screaming about how they love to sexualize little children they want to touch.
[02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:57.840]   And, yes, they want to legalize virtual child porn, which is realistic graphics, which is video games, which is cartoon and manga.
[02:13:57.840 --> 02:13:58.840]   What the hell?
[02:13:58.840 --> 02:14:05.840]   Like, I never thought in my life I would be, you know, fighting this and fighting an uphill battle because the mainstream media will not report on it.
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:07.840]   They're just going to continue to harass conservatives for speaking out.
[02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:09.840]   And I think it is linked to Islam.
[02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:10.840]   I actually do.
[02:14:10.840 --> 02:14:15.840]   I can't critique Islam about how young they marry, how many wives they get to marry, how many wives they get to be.
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:18.840]   I can't say that without getting a ban hammer.
[02:14:18.840 --> 02:14:24.840]   By the way, like any cult or gang, they have all the code words and all the things that they're into.
[02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:30.840]   And we've seen mainstream media try to do a facelift to this and say it doesn't exist, but it's breaking out everywhere.
[02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:32.840]   It's being confirmed.
[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:34.840]   They're everywhere trying to get after our children.
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:36.840]   I mean, these people mean business.
[02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:37.840]   Absolutely.
[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:40.840]   I mean, I went through a lot of trouble to find the codes they use.
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:42.840]   I mean, maps.
[02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:46.840]   They'll say no maps, which doesn't mean they're against a masked, minor, attractive person.
[02:14:46.840 --> 02:14:50.840]   And then they'll call themselves no maps, which doesn't mean they're against it, because that's what it would sound like.
[02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:52.840]   It's no offending maps.
[02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:54.840]   They haven't offended yet.
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:57.840]   I mean, it's a failure in life if you're attracted to three-year-olds.
[02:14:57.840 --> 02:14:59.840]   Sorry, you should not be around children.
[02:14:59.840 --> 02:15:00.840]   You should not be around anyone.
[02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:01.840]   And I found these codes.
[02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:02.840]   I found these flags.
[02:15:02.840 --> 02:15:07.840]   And you know what's even better is if you go to Snopes, Snopes denies that this exists, even though it's out there.
[02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:12.840]   Even though it's in the FBI's own manuals on this.
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:16.840]   Yeah, they, that's how they find each other.
[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:18.840]   You know, they use maps is what they're using.
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:20.840]   And when we catch on to that, they'll use something else.
[02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:23.840]   But they are openly being attracted to children.
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:25.840]   They will say I'm a proud pedophile.
[02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:26.840]   Look at some of these hashtags.
[02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:31.840]   How does Twitter, you know, if I put MAGA, hashtag MAGA, half the time, you know, my tweet disappears.
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:37.840]   But you can put hashtag pedo, pedophile, proud pedo, and it pops right back up.
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:38.840]   Kind of weird.
[02:15:38.840 --> 02:15:39.840]   It's almost like they're possessive of me.
[02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:43.840]   Well, it's been the goal to sexualize children and ruin them as early as possible.
[02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:44.840]   They can't abort them.
[02:15:44.840 --> 02:15:45.840]   They want to sterilize them.
[02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:48.840]   And they want to get them on drugs as soon as possible.
[02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:51.840]   That's the goal of the entire new freedom initiative.
[02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:52.840]   We'll be right back.

[02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:30.840]   The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:33.840]   George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:39.840]   The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:43.840]   Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:45.840]   Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for?
[02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:48.840]   The deep state began with World War I.
[02:17:48.840 --> 02:17:51.840]   The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:54.840]   Available at Amazon Books.
[02:17:54.840 --> 02:18:00.840]   As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.

[02:18:53.840 --> 02:19:06.840]   We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:19:06.840 --> 02:19:08.840]   That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:11.840]   Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.

[02:19:55.840 --> 02:20:02.840]   You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:04.840 --> 02:20:27.840]   [Music]
[02:20:27.840 --> 02:20:33.840]   You know, I remember back in February, and by the way Alex Jones here back live, thanks for joining us.
[02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:44.840]   I remember back in February of 2017, there were a bust of 427 pedophiles with little kids in cages in California and dead kids and dead women.
[02:20:44.840 --> 02:20:48.840]   And there were hundreds caught here and hundreds caught there and then you never see it in the news again.
[02:20:48.840 --> 02:20:58.840]   It just gets shut down and then you see Google delist it where you search it and can't even find it unless you can find the original link.
[02:20:58.840 --> 02:21:10.840]   And that's when you get not even scared, that's when you start pinching yourself and you go, I've had thousands of newspapers, thousands.
[02:21:10.840 --> 02:21:14.840]   And they put the order out that it'll be on thousands of local TV affiliates.
[02:21:14.840 --> 02:21:18.840]   Because they've learned locals trust local news, they don't trust national news.
[02:21:18.840 --> 02:21:24.840]   And Jones makes it up, there's pedophiles, they don't exist.
[02:21:24.840 --> 02:21:32.840]   Meanwhile, thousands of priests admit to raping children in Pennsylvania alone, thousands of nuns, all these other institutions doing it.
[02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:40.840]   Hollywood, convicted rapists producing major films, all of it coming out, all the death.
[02:21:40.840 --> 02:21:44.840]   And then all the other sex cults, everything else.
[02:21:44.840 --> 02:21:50.840]   And I'm not somebody that ever used to even talk about pedophilia, but it's the religion of these people.
[02:21:50.840 --> 02:21:58.840]   And to watch corporate media try to cover up for Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton and Hillary and their whole background.
[02:21:58.840 --> 02:22:03.840]   And the Podesta emails about there'll be kids in the hot tub for your pleasure.
[02:22:03.840 --> 02:22:10.840]   We don't know how they'll behave, some are as young as seven, but they're kids, but they've been tried out.
[02:22:10.840 --> 02:22:12.840]   They should service you well.
[02:22:12.840 --> 02:22:15.840]   By the way, are you coming over next week for the Alistair Crowley ritual?
[02:22:15.840 --> 02:22:23.840]   I mean, it says we're having the Alistair Crowley ritual next week.
[02:22:23.840 --> 02:22:25.840]   Are you coming?
[02:22:25.840 --> 02:22:29.840]   There'll be blood and semen and women's breast milk on the menu.
[02:22:29.840 --> 02:22:47.840]   And you just sit back and then like John Podesta's brother, Tony Podesta, is in the 2007 Washington Post bragging about his deviant art of images of naked little boys tied up, which we won't even show on air.
[02:22:47.840 --> 02:22:53.840]   I will not show the Washington Post that they put in the local Washington Post section of the paper.
[02:22:53.840 --> 02:22:59.840]   It's so far gone that it's in the newspaper.
[02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:05.840]   And then the media goes, Joan says they're killing kids in a basement at a pizza place.
[02:23:05.840 --> 02:23:13.840]   And then edits video of me talking about stuff that happened in the Middle East under Hillary.
[02:23:13.840 --> 02:23:15.840]   We're going to have our guests with us for this segment.
[02:23:15.840 --> 02:23:30.840]   The next I mean, I want to talk about this with you because Mindy Robinson, because you've written one of the most powerful articles that's up to date just on how there's this coming out, how they're all over the news saying we want access to your kids.
[02:23:30.840 --> 02:23:32.840]   You then look at who's leading it.
[02:23:32.840 --> 02:23:33.840]   It's convicted murderers.
[02:23:33.840 --> 02:23:35.840]   It's convicted drug dealers.
[02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:39.840]   It's people that promote Nambla and access to your kids.
[02:23:39.840 --> 02:23:52.840]   And then you've got an article you sent us where you've got major newspapers coming out and making pedophiles that get killed victims of a hate crime.
[02:23:52.840 --> 02:23:54.840]   And it just gets crazier from then.
[02:23:54.840 --> 02:24:03.840]   So how would you describe your awakening and then what you in your public research are seeing?
[02:24:03.840 --> 02:24:10.840]   I've run the political page, my Facebook, and I have a huge interaction with my followers.
[02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:14.840]   And thanks to them, they're the ones that send me that off comment.
[02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:17.840]   You know, there's always something off and then they check it out.
[02:24:17.840 --> 02:24:18.840]   It turns out to be worse.
[02:24:18.840 --> 02:24:20.840]   They send it to me. I will look at it.
[02:24:20.840 --> 02:24:23.840]   You know, I'm not I said I said the same article I sent to you to everyone.
[02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:25.840]   They don't care. I called out NBC.
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:27.840]   They don't care, but I care.
[02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:35.840]   And because I do, because I'm out there doing every 10 minutes, I'm getting sent something else that is just as badly.
[02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:41.840]   Yesterday we had NBC glorifying a pedo with this fluff piece.
[02:24:41.840 --> 02:24:44.840]   He was handsome and he was so good in school.
[02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:46.840]   He's from a sleepy little town.
[02:24:46.840 --> 02:24:50.840]   And these mean, evil vigilantes tricked him.
[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:53.840]   This guy thought he was showing up to a 14 year old Tinder date.
[02:24:53.840 --> 02:24:57.840]   And the whole thing is just like we thought it was a romance novel.
[02:24:57.840 --> 02:24:59.840]   It's violence discussing.
[02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:04.840]   And there is a mainstream attempt to normalize and desensitize people to pedophilia.
[02:25:04.840 --> 02:25:05.840]   This is what they want.
[02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:07.840]   They will not witness.
[02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:09.840]   And they're silencing everyone that speaks out.
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:14.840]   My followers that are calling out these pedophiles are getting bans, are getting sent.
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:16.840]   By the way, by the way, by the way.
[02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:17.840]   Not the pedophiles themselves.
[02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:22.840]   Mindy, in airports everywhere I go, people say you get back after those pedophiles.
[02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:23.840]   We are.
[02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:24.840]   But people are on fire.
[02:25:24.840 --> 02:25:25.840]   They're angry.
[02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:26.840]   They're pissed.
[02:25:26.840 --> 02:25:27.840]   And they're not going away.
[02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:37.840]   And like you said, Vice, the New York Times, Shalon all glorify pedophiles with videos of 4 year old girls that these dudes are drooling over.
[02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:44.840]   So there's this new form of pedophilia where people voyeuristically get off on hearing about pedophilia and kids being raped.
[02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:47.840]   I mean, all I got to say is I'm sorry.
[02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:50.840]   Anybody tries to hurt a child needs killing.
[02:25:50.840 --> 02:25:53.840]   Keep going.
[02:25:53.840 --> 02:25:55.840]   So I say that you'll get banned apparently.
[02:25:55.840 --> 02:25:58.840]   So I had two followers get banned for saying pedophiles should be killed.
[02:25:58.840 --> 02:26:00.840]   But the pedophiles are on there.
[02:26:00.840 --> 02:26:01.840]   They're running free.
[02:26:01.840 --> 02:26:05.840]   And Twitter is kind of their main way to keep each other together.
[02:26:05.840 --> 02:26:06.840]   That's why they have.
[02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:07.840]   Oh, yeah.
[02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:08.840]   Oh, yeah.
[02:26:08.840 --> 02:26:10.840]   And Pelosi can say, you know, they're going to cut Trump's head off.
[02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:11.840]   That's OK.
[02:26:11.840 --> 02:26:18.840]   But if you try to kidnap a kid and rape him and slit their throat and throw him in the back of a garbage dump, you say those people deserve to be killed.
[02:26:18.840 --> 02:26:23.840]   You're a bad person because, like you said, NBC glorifies precious pedos.
[02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:24.840]   Absolutely.
[02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:26.840]   I mean, this is this is what we're up against.
[02:26:26.840 --> 02:26:29.840]   And it's actually kind of terrifying.
[02:26:29.840 --> 02:26:33.840]   Like they make it sound like it's the disorder and that there's nothing they can do to help.
[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:34.840]   Yeah, that's kind of my point.
[02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:36.840]   That's why you need to be in jail forever.
[02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:39.840]   You know, and they're using Twitter to find each other.
[02:26:39.840 --> 02:26:42.840]   And what they do in these chat rooms is even worse.
[02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:48.840]   That's where they're sharing the content, the child porn, you know, just links to anything.
[02:26:48.840 --> 02:26:49.840]   This is what they do.
[02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:50.840]   They're grooming.
[02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:53.840]   Because if you notice, every single profile is a cartoon picture.
[02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:56.840]   It's a happy anime, rainbow cartoon flag picture.
[02:26:56.840 --> 02:26:58.840]   They're trying to be appealing to kids.
[02:26:58.840 --> 02:27:01.840]   And, you know, and the first thing is like, well, DM me private message me.
[02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:02.840]   That's what they want.
[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:04.840]   They want they don't want the world to see what they're doing.
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:05.840]   But this is what they're doing.
[02:27:05.840 --> 02:27:08.840]   And they're using Twitter to stay together and have a community.
[02:27:08.840 --> 02:27:10.840]   There's hundreds, hundreds.
[02:27:10.840 --> 02:27:12.840]   That's a key point you make.
[02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:13.840]   You see these.
[02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:14.840]   It's all My Little Pony.
[02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:15.840]   It's cartoons.
[02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:18.840]   They go target kids sections of these websites.
[02:27:18.840 --> 02:27:23.840]   Then they glorify Todd Nickerson, who is, again, the only person that looks more like
[02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:27.840]   a pedophile than Todd Nickerson is Brian Stelter.
[02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:29.840]   I might be sure.
[02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:32.840]   But I'm not saying Brian Stelter is a pedophile.
[02:27:32.840 --> 02:27:36.840]   I'm just saying I'm just saying if you expected what a pedophile would look like, wouldn't
[02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:38.840]   it look like Todd Nickerson?
[02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:40.840]   It would actually.
[02:27:40.840 --> 02:27:42.840]   Well, he says he is a pedophile.
[02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:44.840]   Well, yeah, I mean, he looks like it.
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:46.840]   He's like, I wouldn't let him babysit.
[02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:49.840]   But would you let Brian Stelter babysit?
[02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:51.840]   I don't let anyone babysit.
[02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:52.840]   I don't trust anyone anymore.
[02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:53.840]   Are you kidding me?
[02:27:53.840 --> 02:27:55.840]   I think everyone should have a.
[02:27:55.840 --> 02:27:59.840]   What about what's wrong with Todd wants to dress in drag and come talk to your five year
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:00.840]   old in school, then it's OK.
[02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:01.840]   Right.
[02:28:01.840 --> 02:28:05.840]   He's going to teach your daughter that she's a boy and your son that he's a girl and going
[02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:11.840]   to and if your child identifies with that in Europe, in Sweden, at age nine, he's allowed
[02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:13.840]   to come date your daughter or son.
[02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:16.840]   What's wrong with Todd Nickerson coming and dating your daughter or son?
[02:28:16.840 --> 02:28:19.840]   Well, there'll be a gun here waiting for him.
[02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:20.840]   That's what.
[02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:22.840]   Oh, no.
[02:28:22.840 --> 02:28:26.840]   And Todd gets to see is the Democrats all over the world.
[02:28:26.840 --> 02:28:30.840]   Liberals want to get rid of the age of consent for vaccines, for sex.
[02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:33.840]   Old Toddy boy.
[02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:36.840]   Old Todd, I never seen a woman done run from him.

[02:33:18.840 --> 02:33:20.840]   America.
[02:33:20.840 --> 02:33:21.840]   America.
[02:33:21.840 --> 02:33:24.840]   Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on here.
[02:33:24.840 --> 02:33:26.840]   Matt Bragg is host of the 4th Hour.
[02:33:26.840 --> 02:33:32.840]   Owen Schroer coming up in the 3 o'clock hour into the 4 o'clock and 5 o'clock hour until
[02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:34.840]   6 o'clock central with the War Room.
[02:33:34.840 --> 02:33:41.840]   And by the way I was in a good mood today until they showed me the famous little drag
[02:33:41.840 --> 02:33:45.840]   queen kid whose parents have told me he was gay since he was two years old now doing more
[02:33:45.840 --> 02:33:50.840]   research and who now don't have jobs but he's rented out to gay clubs and rented out to
[02:33:50.840 --> 02:33:52.840]   hang out with mass murderers or killers.
[02:33:52.840 --> 02:33:56.840]   Excuse me guys only cut up one person chopped him up one person.
[02:33:56.840 --> 02:34:02.840]   So he's a dismemberer only killed one person and talks about taking ketamine on YouTube.
[02:34:02.840 --> 02:34:07.840]   I mean if I was talking about taking ketamine that's evidence I need to be SWAT teamed or
[02:34:07.840 --> 02:34:09.840]   Rojib at all the date rate drug.
[02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:16.840]   And I'm telling you man this whole sexualization of kids is happening as the offense to normalize
[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:21.840]   this as the Catholic Church has been taken over by this and other groups try to normalize
[02:34:21.840 --> 02:34:22.840]   it.
[02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:23.840]   But it's not going to work.
[02:34:23.840 --> 02:34:29.840]   It's kind of like the Terminator Skynet's already been destroyed in the future by John
[02:34:29.840 --> 02:34:30.840]   Connor.
[02:34:30.840 --> 02:34:37.840]   So they sent Terminator back to try to kill John Connor when he's a kid.
[02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:38.840]   See how that works.
[02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:41.840]   So the whole pedophile system is being exposed.
[02:34:41.840 --> 02:34:43.840]   They didn't normalize it.
[02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:46.840]   So worldwide they're just trying to sexualize kids and just say it's normal.
[02:34:46.840 --> 02:34:47.840]   So it's OK it happened.
[02:34:47.840 --> 02:34:53.840]   What did the pope say last year when a quote gay man as the media spun it said hey I was
[02:34:53.840 --> 02:34:58.840]   raped at age six seven eight you know as a little kid by the Catholic priest and the
[02:34:58.840 --> 02:35:06.840]   pope said it's OK that you're gay saying it's OK the priest gave you that gift of rape.
[02:35:06.840 --> 02:35:10.840]   And so as I've said it's terrible to rape women.
[02:35:10.840 --> 02:35:13.840]   But oh my God if you even can't call a woman whistle at him.
[02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:17.840]   Why that's some form of evil rape or just masculinity is toxic.
[02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:25.840]   But if it's a little boy that's what I've said about Hollywood is that it's rampant
[02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:26.840]   the abuse of men.
[02:35:26.840 --> 02:35:32.840]   It's bad for women too but it is absolutely totally rampant.
[02:35:32.840 --> 02:35:36.840]   And then these guys have had so many other men that it doesn't make them excited.
[02:35:36.840 --> 02:35:37.840]   Now they want kids.
[02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:42.840]   And it happened in every other culture right before cultures totally and completely collapsed.
[02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:49.840]   And so quantify this because you're smart lady Mindy Robinson actress turned journalist.
[02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:55.840]   Now that you see your followers on Instagram and on Facebook and on YouTube and on your
[02:35:55.840 --> 02:36:02.840]   own Web site red white and FU dot com just the letter F because it's the same with me.
[02:36:02.840 --> 02:36:09.840]   That is the most common thing I get is you know you shouldn't have backed off on Pizzagate.
[02:36:09.840 --> 02:36:12.840]   And I always say I didn't back off.
[02:36:12.840 --> 02:36:16.840]   I told the crew I think it's a honeypot just this one pizza place.
[02:36:16.840 --> 02:36:21.840]   We know pizza is used as a code word and old pedophile rings that's in the FBI manuals.
[02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:25.840]   We know it's all in these New York emails.
[02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:29.840]   We've got them on this and I had all sorts of sources in the police department you name
[02:36:29.840 --> 02:36:35.840]   it and all diverts to this pizza place was CNN covering it to distract it away from all
[02:36:35.840 --> 02:36:36.840]   the real stuff.
[02:36:36.840 --> 02:36:44.840]   That's all I said was yes I get how they distracted us off into that and that there wasn't a basement
[02:36:44.840 --> 02:36:45.840]   in this place.
[02:36:45.840 --> 02:36:49.840]   I never said that people covered that I have a right to cover people said but they they
[02:36:49.840 --> 02:36:52.840]   they they try to snapshot one area of an investigation.
[02:36:52.840 --> 02:36:55.840]   It'd be like if the cops were after bank robbers.
[02:36:55.840 --> 02:37:00.840]   There were six guys that robbed the bank and they catch five of the guys.
[02:37:00.840 --> 02:37:04.840]   Different locations the next day but the six location they go there it's the wrong location
[02:37:04.840 --> 02:37:09.840]   and they bust the wrong guy is the whole investigation busted are the cops bad.
[02:37:09.840 --> 02:37:10.840]   No they got five of the six.
[02:37:10.840 --> 02:37:12.840]   One of the tips they got was wrong.
[02:37:12.840 --> 02:37:13.840]   It's the wrong house.
[02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:18.840]   Sorry it's the same thing but it's not like I went to a wrong house on purpose.
[02:37:18.840 --> 02:37:23.840]   I didn't go to the house CNN Fox News MSNBC.
[02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:25.840]   They all Fox was involved in this.
[02:37:25.840 --> 02:37:30.840]   Megyn Kelly pointed at that pizza place which did have creepy art and the pedestrians did
[02:37:30.840 --> 02:37:33.840]   go there but but no there's not dungeons blah blah blah.
[02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:36.840]   I don't think Alif on us is in there doing things.
[02:37:36.840 --> 02:37:41.840]   So it turns into the media making it about Alif on us which is then projected onto me
[02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:45.840]   and the media says that I'm the one that's done all this to these innocent people blah
[02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:48.840]   blah blah and then it becomes I am the abuser of children.
[02:37:48.840 --> 02:37:51.840]   That's the alchemy of this thing and that's what I said.
[02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:53.840]   You're not doing that.
[02:37:53.840 --> 02:38:00.840]   I'm on record exposing pedophilia and the UN and the globalist and all the confirmed
[02:38:00.840 --> 02:38:05.840]   cases of it by the millions of kids and radical Islam being obsessed with pedophilia.
[02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:07.840]   Don't you try that with me.
[02:38:07.840 --> 02:38:08.840]   And there's the same thing with Sandy Hook.
[02:38:08.840 --> 02:38:11.840]   But just where do you think we should go with this.
[02:38:11.840 --> 02:38:13.840]   How deep does it go.
[02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:17.840]   Why do you think they're trying this big offensive now to bring this out normalize
[02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:18.840]   it.
[02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:23.840]   Well I think for personal reasons obviously there are higher ups and powers be that are
[02:38:23.840 --> 02:38:25.840]   pedophiles and that's it.
[02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:30.840]   You know you're a pedophile or you're getting paid off to support them or morally you're
[02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:35.840]   just you know I feel a lot of times the regressive left picks the opposite whatever we want no
[02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:39.840]   matter how much makes sense no matter how much morally it's the upright thing to do
[02:38:39.840 --> 02:38:43.840]   just to be difficult pick the opposite of what you know conservatives and what really
[02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:45.840]   the average middle America wants.
[02:38:45.840 --> 02:38:47.840]   You know that's kind of what they do.
[02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:50.840]   They'll put out the fact I'll put out the facts they'll find one thing wrong one thing
[02:38:50.840 --> 02:38:54.840]   they didn't turn out wrong and put this only for everything out the window like it didn't
[02:38:54.840 --> 02:38:55.840]   matter like it.
[02:38:55.840 --> 02:38:57.840]   That's what Snopes does it looks for that one wrong wording.
[02:38:57.840 --> 02:38:59.840]   Oh false mostly false.
[02:38:59.840 --> 02:39:01.840]   That doesn't make it false.
[02:39:01.840 --> 02:39:06.840]   You're kind of the way they do it is in a way to just discredit it and people that don't
[02:39:06.840 --> 02:39:07.840]   know better will see a headline.
[02:39:07.840 --> 02:39:09.840]   We'll just see the mainstream news.
[02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:13.840]   You know most people don't go deep and look further for news and then they believe it.
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:17.840]   I think that's how it's gotten this far and I think I actually think the worst point
[02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:23.840]   of NBC yesterday a whole fluff piece about this wonderful pedo that killed himself and
[02:39:23.840 --> 02:39:29.840]   I'm sorry but my fans and most Americans like and we really just don't care and that's
[02:39:29.840 --> 02:39:31.840]   kind of like the trash taking itself out.
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:38.840]   And so I feel like they're going to continue to block and censor ban everyone that speaks
[02:39:38.840 --> 02:39:40.840]   you know against pedophiles.
[02:39:40.840 --> 02:39:44.840]   They're going to continue to get paid off and mislead people and I think the only way
[02:39:44.840 --> 02:39:49.840]   we really can fight it is if the average American and and we cross party lines.
[02:39:49.840 --> 02:39:53.840]   We have classic liberals and people that want to do the right thing also have to speak up
[02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:58.840]   and say it's right and say look I know you voted Trump and you probably hate me but you
[02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:02.840]   know this is children and we need to step up and do the right thing even if it means
[02:40:02.840 --> 02:40:06.840]   my crazy leftist friends are going to be angry and all this stuff and deal with all the things
[02:40:06.840 --> 02:40:07.840]   that you know we've been dealing with anyway.
[02:40:07.840 --> 02:40:12.840]   I think we have to cross party lines and kind of unite and say we're not going to stand
[02:40:12.840 --> 02:40:13.840]   for this.
[02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:15.840]   I don't care how much you shove it down our throat.
[02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:17.840]   I'm not going to accept this.
[02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:20.840]   I don't care what you ban me on and I think that's how most people feel.
[02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:23.840]   We're not going to take this laying down and I'm not going to forget it's been six months
[02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:24.840]   since I've uncovered this.
[02:40:24.840 --> 02:40:25.840]   I'm not going to forget.
[02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:29.840]   I'm just going to get more information and I'm going to find more people and I'm going
[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:32.840]   to start tracking who's supporting them who's getting money who's hiding it who's who's
[02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:33.840]   doing this stuff.
[02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:35.840]   I want to follow the trail and I'm not going to lie.
[02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:40.840]   I've I've gotten some lists on the first article this 300 profiles of people in a pedophile
[02:40:40.840 --> 02:40:42.840]   chat room exchanging information.
[02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:46.840]   How easy would it be for people just go in there and find out who they really are and
[02:40:46.840 --> 02:40:48.840]   I bet you'd be surprised at who they are.
[02:40:48.840 --> 02:40:53.840]   I wouldn't be surprised if there's an actor director in there or someone kindergarten
[02:40:53.840 --> 02:40:55.840]   teacher or something.
[02:40:55.840 --> 02:40:58.840]   I think we need to have their stuff basically.
[02:40:58.840 --> 02:41:01.840]   Oh, let me tell you I was contacted.
[02:41:01.840 --> 02:41:04.840]   I've been contacted by quite a few gay men.
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:07.840]   Some of them are prominent and these are off the record discussions.
[02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:08.840]   We're come back and talk about this.
[02:41:08.840 --> 02:41:10.840]   I was going to let you go now, but I want to talk to a little more because I've got
[02:41:10.840 --> 02:41:13.840]   an important question to raise for you, but I've been contacted by people and they'll
[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:17.840]   say I probably wouldn't be quote gay if I wasn't molested when I was 10 years old.
[02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:20.840]   They say, but they say listen regardless.
[02:41:20.840 --> 02:41:25.840]   I love everybody, but they're definitely targeting kids and then they've gone out
[02:41:25.840 --> 02:41:30.840]   and contacted a lot of these prominent people and they contact them back and they have discussions
[02:41:30.840 --> 02:41:34.840]   and debates and and and then these prominent people say, oh yeah, I wish I could have sex
[02:41:34.840 --> 02:41:35.840]   with kids.
[02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:38.840]   That's really what I want or oh I have because a lot of them were abused as kids.
[02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:39.840]   They think that's normal.
[02:41:39.840 --> 02:41:44.840]   So they kind of pass on the evil and and then I told these people just go to law enforcement
[02:41:44.840 --> 02:41:49.840]   because because this is so prevalent and then I was also given information about a lot
[02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:52.840]   of the sex ed teachers don't even hide it.
[02:41:52.840 --> 02:41:57.840]   They put the Nambla symbols and things up behind in the elementary school classes.
[02:41:57.840 --> 02:42:03.840]   They know it now do it in elementary and they're in doctor ending the kids into porn's okay,
[02:42:03.840 --> 02:42:07.840]   but just some of it and we're going to manage it and they even watch blurred out porn in
[02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:12.840]   the classes and then you look at what they've got and don't show anything.
[02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:17.840]   People can look for themselves and it says I love pizza and the guys got a pin on his
[02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:18.840]   head on his shirt.
[02:42:18.840 --> 02:42:23.840]   I love pizza and it says pizza pizza pizza pizza and they liken sex to pizza and this
[02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:30.840]   is a national curriculum around the country from Pennsylvania to New York to California.
[02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:31.840]   Folks investigate it for yourselves.
[02:42:31.840 --> 02:42:33.840]   I'm not going to go there.
[02:42:33.840 --> 02:42:37.840]   I'm not going to get sued out of oblivion for taking the first hit, but we know who
[02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:42.840]   they are and I'm going to give a little bit of a heads up because they're so arrogant
[02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:43.840]   they can't stop.
[02:42:43.840 --> 02:42:47.840]   I'm going to use the money I've got left.
[02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:49.840]   We're going to put PIs on their ash.
[02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:50.840]   I'm letting them know we're coming.
[02:42:50.840 --> 02:42:51.840]   We'll be right back.
[02:42:51.840 --> 02:42:52.840]   Stay with us.
[02:42:52.840 --> 02:42:53.840]   Now that doesn't get me killed.

[02:43:54.840 --> 02:43:58.840]   The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[02:43:58.840 --> 02:44:03.840]   full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:44:03.840 --> 02:44:08.840]   It literally dumbs the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers
[02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:10.840]   the best eye out of the world.
[02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:15.840]   We've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good
[02:44:15.840 --> 02:44:19.840]   but hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:44:19.840 --> 02:44:24.840]   So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2.
[02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:25.840]   That's been incredible.
[02:44:25.840 --> 02:44:30.840]   Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:32.840]   of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[02:44:32.840 --> 02:44:37.840]   But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with
[02:44:37.840 --> 02:44:43.840]   three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes
[02:44:43.840 --> 02:44:46.840]   it even more bioavailable.
[02:44:46.840 --> 02:44:50.840]   Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[02:44:50.840 --> 02:44:51.840]   discovery.

[02:45:55.840 --> 02:45:59.840]   Our grandparents, the great grandparents, knew that they canned food during the fall
[02:45:59.840 --> 02:46:01.840]   so they'd have it during the winter.

[02:47:05.840 --> 02:47:11.840]   Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:16.840]   Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:16.840 --> 02:47:19.840]   Suffer the little children unto me.
[02:47:19.840 --> 02:47:23.840]   It would be better for you to tie a millstone around your neck, a giant boulder, and throw
[02:47:23.840 --> 02:47:27.840]   yourself in the deepest sea than to hurt one of these.
[02:47:27.840 --> 02:47:32.840]   The religion of the globalist is ancient.
[02:47:32.840 --> 02:47:37.840]   It is the abuse of the life force energy of children.
[02:47:37.840 --> 02:47:42.840]   You always know, and Brans Stoker's Count Dracula, or in the movies they've had about
[02:47:42.840 --> 02:47:44.840]   it, what does he bring to his new brides?
[02:47:44.840 --> 02:47:49.840]   But a baby he's kidnapped so they can all bite into the baby and get the innocence.
[02:47:49.840 --> 02:47:53.840]   Well, now, out of China and other areas, they just melt down the baby's collagen and take
[02:47:53.840 --> 02:47:58.840]   the baby blood and then the rich women take the injections into their veins.
[02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:00.840]   And they eat the capsules into their stomachs.
[02:48:00.840 --> 02:48:04.840]   They inject the collagen into their faces.
[02:48:04.840 --> 02:48:06.840]   And it's all over the news.
[02:48:06.840 --> 02:48:07.840]   Told you about it a decade ago.
[02:48:07.840 --> 02:48:09.840]   Now it's all over the news.
[02:48:09.840 --> 02:48:13.840]   I remember at Bilderberg once I talked about China caught selling dead babies wrapped
[02:48:13.840 --> 02:48:14.840]   in gold foil.
[02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:17.840]   And Glenn Beck made a big joke out of it.
[02:48:17.840 --> 02:48:20.840]   Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[02:48:20.840 --> 02:48:25.840]   Well, I'm not going to be part of the ultimate sin.
[02:48:25.840 --> 02:48:29.840]   Oh, remember Chris Hansen had the number one TV show for a while.
[02:48:29.840 --> 02:48:31.840]   And he would show these Shekhos.
[02:48:31.840 --> 02:48:35.840]   We thought they were having sex with 12 year old girls, 13 year old girls, showing up
[02:48:35.840 --> 02:48:40.840]   with a bag of Skittles and Capri Sun or whatever.
[02:48:40.840 --> 02:48:46.840]   And they got rid of Chris Hansen and acted like, well, look, he was a hypocrite for an
[02:48:46.840 --> 02:48:49.840]   extramarital affair.
[02:48:49.840 --> 02:48:51.840]   Well, I didn't know he was a Puritan.
[02:48:51.840 --> 02:48:55.840]   So his crime was he was having sex with another woman and got a divorce.
[02:48:55.840 --> 02:48:57.840]   Wow.
[02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:02.840]   That that's totally consensual and not saying it's a good thing to do, but it's not pedophilia.
[02:49:02.840 --> 02:49:08.840]   So, see, there's also what our guest, Mindy Robinson, investigative journalist, reporter
[02:49:08.840 --> 02:49:12.840]   and, of course, successful actress previous to that and ongoing, which is raising how
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:14.840]   I'll see in the news.
[02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:19.840]   Law enforcement continues, both federal and state, to do stings on what they claim is
[02:49:19.840 --> 02:49:22.840]   a pedophilia and child porn epidemic.
[02:49:22.840 --> 02:49:23.840]   But there's no proof of it.
[02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:27.840]   It's like saying there's no proof the sun came up this morning.
[02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:36.840]   So you see this incredible, reflexive defense and attempt to stop the investigations when
[02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:41.840]   man, the pedophilia all over the world and killing children and exporting them and women
[02:49:41.840 --> 02:49:42.840]   is epidemic.
[02:49:42.840 --> 02:49:47.840]   And then to have them deny it, Mindy, is just it really shows they're signing on to it or
[02:49:47.840 --> 02:49:50.840]   the pedophiles have so much money they're paying for this coverage.
[02:49:50.840 --> 02:49:52.840]   What do you think's going on?
[02:49:52.840 --> 02:49:55.840]   Well, I have proof.
[02:49:55.840 --> 02:49:56.840]   I mean, I don't know what further proof.
[02:49:56.840 --> 02:49:58.840]   No, I think I love to catch a predator.
[02:49:58.840 --> 02:50:03.840]   It was a messed up show, but it opens your eyes at how more vigilant we had to be, how
[02:50:03.840 --> 02:50:08.840]   laws have not caught up to technology and what happens online.
[02:50:08.840 --> 02:50:09.840]   You know what I mean?
[02:50:09.840 --> 02:50:14.840]   I'm an adult and I see what I get set, you know, pictures, hardcore porn.
[02:50:14.840 --> 02:50:15.840]   Like I could have been a 10 year old.
[02:50:15.840 --> 02:50:16.840]   They don't care.
[02:50:16.840 --> 02:50:18.840]   Laws have not caught up to technology.
[02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:20.840]   And I think regressive leftists have taken over that.
[02:50:20.840 --> 02:50:21.840]   I love to catch a predator.
[02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:25.840]   It made everyone a little bit more careful, you know, and we were catching people.
[02:50:25.840 --> 02:50:29.840]   And we were outing them and we were shaming them and we were stigmatizing them.
[02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:31.840]   And that is everything the left wants to get rid of.
[02:50:31.840 --> 02:50:32.840]   They want it to be normal.
[02:50:32.840 --> 02:50:34.840]   They don't want to have a stigma with it.
[02:50:34.840 --> 02:50:36.840]   There's a reason they're supposed to be a stigma.
[02:50:36.840 --> 02:50:37.840]   You ruin a kid's life.
[02:50:37.840 --> 02:50:41.840]   You start doing this stuff, you know, and then they're all across the board from, you
[02:50:41.840 --> 02:50:43.840]   know, believing that children can consent.
[02:50:43.840 --> 02:50:44.840]   They really want to push for that.
[02:50:44.840 --> 02:50:48.840]   They believe if a child enjoys it, it's not abuse.
[02:50:48.840 --> 02:50:51.840]   How could it be abuse if the child, the child doesn't know what it wants.
[02:50:51.840 --> 02:50:53.840]   I mean, growing up is confusing enough.
[02:50:53.840 --> 02:50:58.840]   They're just making it worse between the sexualizing drag queens and all this other stuff.
[02:50:58.840 --> 02:51:00.840]   We're definitely at a battle here.
[02:51:00.840 --> 02:51:02.840]   And I think it's a bit of both.
[02:51:02.840 --> 02:51:06.840]   And I think anyone looking the other way, I think a lot of mainstream media execs and
[02:51:06.840 --> 02:51:09.840]   CEOs and how many of them are really owned by Saudis.
[02:51:09.840 --> 02:51:12.840]   Now, the second largest shareholder of Twitter is a Saudi prince.
[02:51:12.840 --> 02:51:16.840]   You know, you mean to tell me that that doesn't affect what they censor?
[02:51:16.840 --> 02:51:17.840]   No, it does.
[02:51:17.840 --> 02:51:19.840]   It absolutely does affect what they censor.
[02:51:19.840 --> 02:51:21.840]   And I can see it and I can prove it.
[02:51:21.840 --> 02:51:26.840]   All I need is an out to say, please, normal people look at this proof and let's do something
[02:51:26.840 --> 02:51:27.840]   about it.
[02:51:27.840 --> 02:51:34.840]   It's just real hard to do because all of mainstream media is obviously on their side.
[02:51:34.840 --> 02:51:39.840]   Well, you know, sitting back looking at this, I had a gut level, a spiritual level, Mindy.
[02:51:39.840 --> 02:51:44.840]   I've never seen people's instincts come in harder, especially women's all over.
[02:51:44.840 --> 02:51:46.840]   And they're digging into the pedophile stuff.
[02:51:46.840 --> 02:51:51.840]   And they're like, oh, my God, they're doing drag taught videos at the elementary school.
[02:51:51.840 --> 02:51:52.840]   Oh, my God.
[02:51:52.840 --> 02:51:58.840]   They're sending in these men with big fat men in purple wigs to tell my kids they might
[02:51:58.840 --> 02:51:59.840]   be another sex.
[02:51:59.840 --> 02:52:03.840]   If a fat guy in a purple wig showed up at the park to tell your daughter or son about
[02:52:03.840 --> 02:52:04.840]   sex, they get arrested.
[02:52:04.840 --> 02:52:10.840]   So how in the hell is it OK if it's sanctioned because the state's involved and we need lawsuits
[02:52:10.840 --> 02:52:14.840]   and we need aggressive legal action against this now?
[02:52:14.840 --> 02:52:20.840]   I think we need to purge our entire educational system from college all the way down.
[02:52:20.840 --> 02:52:21.840]   You know what I mean?
[02:52:21.840 --> 02:52:24.840]   I think it started we were laughing about, you know, Common Core math and how dumb it
[02:52:24.840 --> 02:52:27.840]   was, but it goes obviously a lot further than that.
[02:52:27.840 --> 02:52:28.840]   School should be school.
[02:52:28.840 --> 02:52:31.840]   You should be learning about facts and stuff you can prove.
[02:52:31.840 --> 02:52:34.840]   You start throwing in social experiments.
[02:52:34.840 --> 02:52:37.840]   And like I said, growing up is confusing enough.
[02:52:37.840 --> 02:52:42.840]   You don't need to throw in a purple haired person that's non-binary like no, no, no.
[02:52:42.840 --> 02:52:43.840]   They're kids.
[02:52:43.840 --> 02:52:47.840]   They shouldn't even be thinking about sex until like maybe middle school.
[02:52:47.840 --> 02:52:52.840]   You know, all of it, sexualization of children and they change the subjects here being anti
[02:52:52.840 --> 02:52:53.840]   LGBT.
[02:52:53.840 --> 02:52:54.840]   You know, you know what?
[02:52:54.840 --> 02:52:56.840]   I don't want any sex around kids.
[02:52:56.840 --> 02:52:58.840]   And all of you are creepy and you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
[02:52:58.840 --> 02:52:59.840]   But they're so arrogant.
[02:52:59.840 --> 02:53:03.840]   Have you seen the city council meetings where the drag queens show up and say, you're going
[02:53:03.840 --> 02:53:05.840]   to give me access to your five year old you monsters.
[02:53:05.840 --> 02:53:09.840]   We're going to groom your kids so they're not bigots like you.
[02:53:09.840 --> 02:53:13.840]   Some do he goes, I work at the local gay bar stripping.
[02:53:13.840 --> 02:53:15.840]   I know not to act like that around the kids.
[02:53:15.840 --> 02:53:17.840]   I'm going to groom your kids.
[02:53:17.840 --> 02:53:19.840]   I'm going to groom them.
[02:53:19.840 --> 02:53:20.840]   They're mad.
[02:53:20.840 --> 02:53:21.840]   I'm going to groom them.
[02:53:21.840 --> 02:53:23.840]   Everybody's like, what?
[02:53:23.840 --> 02:53:27.840]   These people are so out of their mind.
[02:53:27.840 --> 02:53:31.840]   They don't even know what happens in the famous story of Sodom and Gomorrah.
[02:53:31.840 --> 02:53:33.840]   They got a couple of angels with them.
[02:53:33.840 --> 02:53:36.840]   They're arguing with lots and we're going to destroy the city.
[02:53:36.840 --> 02:53:39.840]   Whether you believe it happened or not, it sounds like a nuclear weapon goes off.
[02:53:39.840 --> 02:53:43.840]   And the angels are like, we're going to kill these people.
[02:53:43.840 --> 02:53:44.840]   They're trying to have sex with us.
[02:53:44.840 --> 02:53:47.840]   And there's this big group of men going, give us those good looking men.
[02:53:47.840 --> 02:53:48.840]   We're going to have sex with them.
[02:53:48.840 --> 02:53:51.840]   And I mean, Sodom and Gomorrah, they weren't saying, give us your kids.
[02:53:51.840 --> 02:53:53.840]   It was just give us your men.
[02:53:53.840 --> 02:53:55.840]   You said, well, that didn't happen.
[02:53:55.840 --> 02:53:57.840]   Well, now they're coming saying, give us your kids.
[02:53:57.840 --> 02:53:59.840]   We're going to groom them.
[02:53:59.840 --> 02:54:01.840]   Listen, you're amazing.
[02:54:01.840 --> 02:54:02.840]   Mindy Robinson, great work.
[02:54:02.840 --> 02:54:07.840]   We look forward to having you back up, red, white and FU.com, Twitter, Instagram.
[02:54:07.840 --> 02:54:08.840]   I heart Mindy.
[02:54:08.840 --> 02:54:10.840]   God bless you and keep the faith.
[02:54:10.840 --> 02:54:11.840]   - Thank you.
[02:54:11.840 --> 02:54:16.840]   - Okay, we got Matt Bracken coming up.
[02:54:16.840 --> 02:54:20.840]   And I am about three days behind in promotions here.
[02:54:20.840 --> 02:54:23.840]   That's why you've not really heard any plugging today.
[02:54:23.840 --> 02:54:25.840]   It's because I'm going to catch 22.
[02:54:25.840 --> 02:54:30.840]   The sale of 50 to 75% off storewide free shipping, double pay for your points and a free gift
[02:54:30.840 --> 02:54:33.840]   has been fabulously successful.
[02:54:33.840 --> 02:54:36.840]   Except we've done the math.
[02:54:36.840 --> 02:54:41.840]   We sold probably $3 million worth of merchandise the last two months.
[02:54:41.840 --> 02:54:43.840]   And we probably made $300,000.
[02:54:43.840 --> 02:54:45.840]   That's how low we sold everything.
[02:54:45.840 --> 02:54:49.840]   But the good news is not having to pay inventory tax, we probably saved another 400,000.
[02:54:49.840 --> 02:54:53.840]   So this has put us in the black for the next few months.
[02:54:53.840 --> 02:54:57.840]   But no wonder people bought the water filtration, the air filtration, the supplements, all of it.
[02:54:57.840 --> 02:55:01.840]   Because this really is by a long, long way.
[02:55:01.840 --> 02:55:05.840]   I mean, we're talking order of magnitude, the best sale ever had.
[02:55:05.840 --> 02:55:07.840]   So here's the problem.
[02:55:07.840 --> 02:55:08.840]   We're selling out of X2.
[02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:09.840]   We're selling out of X3.
[02:55:09.840 --> 02:55:11.840]   We're selling out of Brain Force Plus.
[02:55:11.840 --> 02:55:17.840]   We're selling out of Lung Cleanse, Winter Sun, Secret 12, Super Female, Super Male Vitality.
[02:55:17.840 --> 02:55:18.840]   Those are the last runs.
[02:55:18.840 --> 02:55:20.840]   Not because they're not number two best seller.
[02:55:20.840 --> 02:55:21.840]   They are.
[02:55:21.840 --> 02:55:24.840]   We can't get the wild crafted herbs of these types anymore.
[02:55:24.840 --> 02:55:28.840]   And you can't get some of the ingredients that are certified organic.
[02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:30.840]   So we're just discontinuing that because it's too hard to get.
[02:55:30.840 --> 02:55:32.840]   It's incredible.
[02:55:32.840 --> 02:55:40.840]   So we would continue to have this deal for a while, but so much has already sold out, like the T-shirts, at large and extra large, that we have to end it.
[02:55:40.840 --> 02:55:50.840]   The catch 22 is I'm so busy that unless I stay up here until 10 o'clock tonight, we're not even going to have the new stuff tomorrow.
[02:55:50.840 --> 02:55:55.840]   So I may just not have the specials tomorrow, and then there's no new specials.
[02:55:55.840 --> 02:56:00.840]   So I'm not like saying this is yesterday, the last day.
[02:56:00.840 --> 02:56:02.840]   And then today it's like this is the last day.
[02:56:02.840 --> 02:56:03.840]   Here's the deal.
[02:56:03.840 --> 02:56:16.840]   We have three new incredible products, but they're so good, and I'm serious when I say this, that I don't want to just announce them and I don't want to just launch them and then just kind of let it dissipate.
[02:56:16.840 --> 02:56:21.840]   Because I've launched a lot of products that are amazing, and I don't make a big deal about them.
[02:56:21.840 --> 02:56:23.840]   People don't try them.
[02:56:23.840 --> 02:56:26.840]   They don't see how great they are, and we have a lot of bestsellers.
[02:56:26.840 --> 02:56:29.840]   Either stuff's a bestseller or it doesn't sell.
[02:56:29.840 --> 02:56:41.840]   And these three new products are so good that I'm sitting here with so much data, so much evidence of how great this is that I don't know where to start.
[02:56:41.840 --> 02:56:45.840]   And then I've got to get lawyers to approve what I'm going to say.
[02:56:45.840 --> 02:56:50.840]   They've been standing by for a week and a half, and I haven't cut the final edge.
[02:56:50.840 --> 02:56:58.840]   So this is the last day one way or another because it's already the last day for most of half our products already sold out.
[02:56:58.840 --> 02:57:00.840]   So this is it.
[02:57:00.840 --> 02:57:01.840]   This is the total clearance.
[02:57:01.840 --> 02:57:02.840]   It was successful.
[02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:08.840]   I'm hustling to get more T-shirts in because you sell more T-shirts in large and extra large and all the others combined.
[02:57:08.840 --> 02:57:11.840]   We've got all the other T-shirts the other sizes were just sold out of those.
[02:57:11.840 --> 02:57:15.840]   We had to stop giving the free gift of T-shirts because most of you wanted those.
[02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:18.840]   We have another free gift that's excellent as well.
[02:57:18.840 --> 02:57:23.840]   Point is, this is the biggest sales in our history, and this has got to be the last day.
[02:57:23.840 --> 02:57:27.840]   One way or another, I'm just going to do it.
[02:57:27.840 --> 02:57:29.840]   Here's what I'm going to try to do.
[02:57:29.840 --> 02:57:36.840]   I'm going to come back before Matt Bracken when we come back in two minutes, and I'm going to do my best to tell you about one of the new products.
[02:57:36.840 --> 02:57:38.840]   That little five-minute segment, I'm going to do my very best.
[02:57:38.840 --> 02:57:39.840]   Please stay with us.

[02:59:46.840 --> 02:59:51.840]   You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:51.840 --> 03:00:09.840]   You've found it, the front lines of the human awakening.
[03:00:09.840 --> 03:00:11.840]   It's the InfoWars.
[03:00:11.840 --> 03:00:14.840]   And now, Alex Jones.
[03:00:14.840 --> 03:00:22.840]   Well, by the grace of God and a lot of luck and your support, we beat Hillary Clinton.
[03:00:22.840 --> 03:00:27.840]   And I properly gauged that humanity would want freedom worldwide versus globalism.
[03:00:27.840 --> 03:00:38.840]   And as arrogant as the corporate press was, the trader press, we just got the word out about globalism versus freedom, versus nationalism and renaissance, that the world would revolt.
[03:00:38.840 --> 03:00:45.840]   And the new president in Brazil is delivering in royals flush right now.
[03:00:45.840 --> 03:00:47.840]   And so is the rest of Eastern Europe.
[03:00:47.840 --> 03:00:49.840]   So is the UK.
[03:00:49.840 --> 03:00:50.840]   So is Russia.
[03:00:50.840 --> 03:00:59.840]   And I'm just proud America is right beside that big, fat, juicy renaissance that South Korea, Japan, many others are involved in, some areas of the Middle East.
[03:00:59.840 --> 03:01:01.840]   There was a big renaissance coming in the Middle East.
[03:01:01.840 --> 03:01:04.840]   That's why the globalists set loose seven years ago, the Arab Spring.
[03:01:04.840 --> 03:01:10.840]   Now, that said, Matt Brackett is coming up with a lot of key intel in the next hour, former Navy SEAL bestselling author.
[03:01:10.840 --> 03:01:16.840]   But we're going to launch in the next few weeks three new products.
[03:01:16.840 --> 03:01:25.840]   Now, these three new products are sponsor driven because you know they're trying to take our payment processing away.
[03:01:25.840 --> 03:01:27.840]   They're trying to shut us down, George Soros says.
[03:01:27.840 --> 03:01:28.840]   Now, they failed.
[03:01:28.840 --> 03:01:29.840]   They took five of our six.
[03:01:29.840 --> 03:01:30.840]   We got a few backups.
[03:01:30.840 --> 03:01:32.840]   Got some other things there.
[03:01:32.840 --> 03:01:47.840]   But just in case, I am forging alliances with top companies in the U.S. that reached out to us and some that I've known for a long time who want to sponsor us regardless of what happens.
[03:01:47.840 --> 03:01:49.840]   They're ready for the fight.
[03:01:49.840 --> 03:01:58.840]   I said to these three companies, this goes back months ago when this all started, I said, I don't want you to go through that.
[03:01:58.840 --> 03:02:00.840]   Why should we show our hand?
[03:02:00.840 --> 03:02:03.840]   Let's have our cake and eat it too with the audience.
[03:02:03.840 --> 03:02:06.840]   We'll private label your bestselling products.
[03:02:06.840 --> 03:02:11.840]   And then that way everybody gets the best price.
[03:02:11.840 --> 03:02:13.840]   They get it from you.
[03:02:13.840 --> 03:02:14.840]   You drop ship it.
[03:02:14.840 --> 03:02:17.840]   You handle it under a new company name, whole new deal.
[03:02:17.840 --> 03:02:24.840]   And then George Soros has a lot more trouble coming after you with the different criminal organizations he runs.
[03:02:24.840 --> 03:02:27.840]   And I said, okay, then, yeah, we'll do that.
[03:02:27.840 --> 03:02:29.840]   Well, we've done it.
[03:02:29.840 --> 03:02:34.840]   We've built three new websites, three new companies with these folks.
[03:02:34.840 --> 03:02:41.840]   And the first one I'm going to announce here, ladies and gentlemen, is Washington's Reserve.
[03:02:41.840 --> 03:02:45.840]   Washington's with a dash reserve dot com.
[03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:50.840]   This is in the top three.
[03:02:50.840 --> 03:02:54.840]   I'm not going to wait too much.
[03:02:54.840 --> 03:02:59.840]   Not just CBD oil, but herbal companies in the nation.
[03:02:59.840 --> 03:03:01.840]   Okay.
[03:03:01.840 --> 03:03:03.840]   And they're in Whole Foods.
[03:03:03.840 --> 03:03:05.840]   They're in everything.
[03:03:05.840 --> 03:03:17.840]   And they already put out this CBD enriched extracts from wild organic hemp.
[03:03:17.840 --> 03:03:20.840]   The very best.
[03:03:20.840 --> 03:03:24.840]   They already are one of the main people in the country with this.
[03:03:24.840 --> 03:03:27.840]   And what's great about this is there's no THC.
[03:03:27.840 --> 03:03:28.840]   Doesn't get you high.
[03:03:28.840 --> 03:03:30.840]   It's legal in all 50 states.
[03:03:30.840 --> 03:03:32.840]   There's no questions like a lot of the CBD oil.
[03:03:32.840 --> 03:03:34.840]   Gets you locked up.
[03:03:34.840 --> 03:03:35.840]   And it's even as good.
[03:03:35.840 --> 03:03:37.840]   This has all the good, none of the bad.
[03:03:37.840 --> 03:03:41.840]   It's from raw hemp, CBD oil, super strong.
[03:03:41.840 --> 03:03:47.840]   And we've got it from super weak and super inexpensive right up to Godzilla level.
[03:03:47.840 --> 03:03:50.840]   And by Godzilla level, it doesn't get you high.
[03:03:50.840 --> 03:03:55.840]   It makes you, well, knockouts great with valerian root and L-tryptophan and all the rest of it.
[03:03:55.840 --> 03:03:57.840]   It's awesome.
[03:03:57.840 --> 03:03:59.840]   But this is even stronger.
[03:03:59.840 --> 03:04:01.840]   What I've been taking is the sleep aid.
[03:04:01.840 --> 03:04:04.840]   And my Lord, is it incredible.
[03:04:04.840 --> 03:04:06.840]   And again, you don't feel it when you're on it.
[03:04:06.840 --> 03:04:09.840]   It just, there's no drug in it.
[03:04:09.840 --> 03:04:11.840]   There's nothing that gets you arrested.
[03:04:11.840 --> 03:04:18.840]   It's all what's in the hemp, the George Washington group, at Mount Vernon.
[03:04:18.840 --> 03:04:20.840]   And it's all there.
[03:04:20.840 --> 03:04:23.840]   And there's literally more than 30 products on the site.
[03:04:23.840 --> 03:04:28.840]   Because this is private labeled one of the top.
[03:04:28.840 --> 03:04:30.840]   They've already given away too much saying top three.
[03:04:30.840 --> 03:04:32.840]   But it's a big company.
[03:04:32.840 --> 03:04:36.840]   And they were willing to go to bat with us with a contract, everything, to not back down.
[03:04:36.840 --> 03:04:39.840]   I said, listen, let's just have your cake and eat it too.
[03:04:39.840 --> 03:04:43.840]   Just like my pillow is keeping Tucker Carlson on the air, it's the same thing with this.
[03:04:43.840 --> 03:04:46.840]   And it's Washington's reserve.
[03:04:46.840 --> 03:04:51.840]   Ladies and gentlemen, we're ready to ship it to you anywhere in the 50 states or worldwide.
[03:04:51.840 --> 03:04:53.840]   It's amazing.
[03:04:53.840 --> 03:05:00.840]   Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.
[03:05:00.840 --> 03:05:08.840]   Help the good bacteria thrive and support overall digestive health with our specially formulated Prebiotic Fiber.
[03:05:08.840 --> 03:05:13.840]   A mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia, fruit, and flax fiber.

[03:05:54.840 --> 03:06:13.840]   [Music]
[03:06:13.840 --> 03:06:29.840]   [Music]
[03:06:29.840 --> 03:06:33.840]   Defending this republic against all enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:06:33.840 --> 03:06:37.840]   You know Matt Bracken's taken over for the hour. Former Navy SEAL, best-selling author.
[03:06:37.840 --> 03:06:40.840]   Website enemiesforeignanddomestic.com
[03:06:40.840 --> 03:06:44.840]   I heard him the other day on the radio while I was driving. I wasn't watching.
[03:06:44.840 --> 03:06:47.840]   And he said, you know, I usually wear this lion necklace.
[03:06:47.840 --> 03:06:50.840]   But he said, now I'm going to wear this Vlad Tepest necklace.
[03:06:50.840 --> 03:06:54.840]   Which I know goes back to the La Reconquista.
[03:06:54.840 --> 03:06:59.840]   When they started taking back Spain from the Moors from the North African invasion.
[03:06:59.840 --> 03:07:02.840]   And I'm telling you, I think that is a symbol that I want to use as well.
[03:07:02.840 --> 03:07:05.840]   Because I don't want the fake symbol of the cross.
[03:07:05.840 --> 03:07:08.840]   Taken over by the fake churches that teaches us to lay down and be slaves.
[03:07:08.840 --> 03:07:11.840]   Christ said, sell your garments and buy swords.
[03:07:11.840 --> 03:07:14.840]   There's a time for Christ to die as a sacrifice for our sins.
[03:07:14.840 --> 03:07:17.840]   But did Moses lay down? No.
[03:07:17.840 --> 03:07:20.840]   Did the Jews lay down at Masada?
[03:07:20.840 --> 03:07:25.840]   There's also a time to defend yourselves. Not offensively, but defensively.
[03:07:25.840 --> 03:07:28.840]   Now once somebody starts a war, everything is defense.
[03:07:28.840 --> 03:07:34.840]   But I do like the Vlad Tepest symbol. And I'm going to get behind it.
[03:07:34.840 --> 03:07:40.840]   And you know what? I had a whole bunch, maybe 5,000 belt buckles forged.
[03:07:40.840 --> 03:07:43.840]   And they were successful and they were good. But they're so expensive to make.
[03:07:43.840 --> 03:07:47.840]   By the time you make them one for 25 bucks and sell it for 40, you don't really find yourself.
[03:07:47.840 --> 03:07:50.840]   Hell, I'm wearing one right now. I mean, I'm wearing my own.
[03:07:50.840 --> 03:07:53.840]   Take it off.
[03:07:53.840 --> 03:07:56.840]   I designed this, baby, years ago.
[03:07:56.840 --> 03:07:58.840]   Veteran owned group out of Oregon, actually.
[03:07:58.840 --> 03:08:01.840]   But I have to make some more. I think we have maybe 1,000 of these.
[03:08:01.840 --> 03:08:04.840]   This is one of 500, this limited edition.
[03:08:04.840 --> 03:08:07.840]   It says Molon, here, let me see the document cam shot.
[03:08:07.840 --> 03:08:09.840]   Molon Labe, Infowars.
[03:08:09.840 --> 03:08:13.840]   By the way, I'm saying this on air that I'm going to get behind the Vlad Tepest movement.
[03:08:13.840 --> 03:08:17.840]   Not because I'm claiming it's mine or a symbol that only I can have.
[03:08:17.840 --> 03:08:21.840]   Anything I talk about like this commercially, there's a run on it.
[03:08:21.840 --> 03:08:24.840]   So I hope everybody starts putting Vlad Tepest stuff out and puts us out of business.
[03:08:24.840 --> 03:08:27.840]   But I am going to put out a Vlad Tepest belt buckle.
[03:08:27.840 --> 03:08:31.840]   That's made in the 1776 line right there.
[03:08:31.840 --> 03:08:37.840]   And I'm going to put out a silver necklace.
[03:08:37.840 --> 03:08:40.840]   And then later, with that successful, a gold one.
[03:08:40.840 --> 03:08:42.840]   Because people want something designer like that.
[03:08:42.840 --> 03:08:46.840]   And that's the type of jewelry I would actually wear that actually has a symbol to it.
[03:08:46.840 --> 03:08:49.840]   Because I'm not a gaudy fellow.
[03:08:49.840 --> 03:08:51.840]   But symbols are everything.
[03:08:51.840 --> 03:08:57.840]   Christian cross with a dagger in the bottom of it.
[03:08:57.840 --> 03:08:59.840]   That is very, very exciting.
[03:08:59.840 --> 03:09:01.840]   Cross of St. James.
[03:09:01.840 --> 03:09:03.840]   So I guess Vlad Tepest came up with the idea about it.
[03:09:03.840 --> 03:09:05.840]   But it's also called the Vlad Tepest cross.
[03:09:05.840 --> 03:09:09.840]   But regardless, people need symbols, don't they, Matt Bracken?
[03:09:09.840 --> 03:09:10.840]   Definitely.
[03:09:10.840 --> 03:09:19.840]   And especially when you're trying to counteract almost a century of Gramscian and Frankfurt School cultural Marxist brainwashing.
[03:09:19.840 --> 03:09:28.840]   I'm sure it's no coincidence that the translation of "thou shalt not murder" got changed to the pacifistic "thou shalt not kill."
[03:09:28.840 --> 03:09:31.840]   Like you mean if a home invader is coming in, just let him have your kids.
[03:09:31.840 --> 03:09:33.840]   Because it's "thou shalt not kill."
[03:09:33.840 --> 03:09:35.840]   That's a completely false translation.
[03:09:35.840 --> 03:09:37.840]   No, the Hebrew translation is "thou shalt not murder."
[03:09:37.840 --> 03:09:40.840]   Which means go out and just kill an innocent person.
[03:09:40.840 --> 03:09:41.840]   Right.
[03:09:41.840 --> 03:09:44.840]   But that doesn't mean no self-defense.
[03:09:44.840 --> 03:09:49.840]   And this is VladTepestBlog.com, the cross.
[03:09:49.840 --> 03:09:52.840]   But there's no copyright on it per se.
[03:09:52.840 --> 03:09:56.840]   He sells them because he's trying to get this idea going.
[03:09:56.840 --> 03:09:57.840]   And he got the idea.
[03:09:57.840 --> 03:09:58.840]   No, no, I heard you talking about it.
[03:09:58.840 --> 03:10:00.840]   That's what I'm saying is that we need pure adoption of this.
[03:10:00.840 --> 03:10:03.840]   And it's the cross of St. James.
[03:10:03.840 --> 03:10:04.840]   That's right.
[03:10:04.840 --> 03:10:09.840]   And his name is St. James Matamoros, which means "kill the Moors."
[03:10:09.840 --> 03:10:16.840]   And the cross is usually shown red because his silver sword was covered with the blood of the Moors.
[03:10:16.840 --> 03:10:26.840]   This is attributed to a battle in the middle of the 800s when Spain was pushed up to like a tiny little strip along the northern coast.
[03:10:26.840 --> 03:10:35.840]   And from there where they were being constantly practically exterminated or made extinct in Spain as free Christian Spanish.
[03:10:35.840 --> 03:10:40.840]   King Ramiro, there was an annual tribute of 100 maidens.
[03:10:40.840 --> 03:10:45.840]   And he finally said, "No, we're not going to pay the 100 maidens tribute from our province."
[03:10:45.840 --> 03:10:52.840]   And prayed and according to whether you want to call it a miracle or a myth or a legend,
[03:10:52.840 --> 03:11:01.840]   St. James the Apostle appeared in Spain on this horse and just started wiping out Moors.
[03:11:01.840 --> 03:11:11.840]   And it still took 700 years, but that cross became the symbol of the fighting Christians that weren't just going to, you know, commit suicide by pacifism.
[03:11:11.840 --> 03:11:13.840]   Let me throw this out about the cross of St. James.
[03:11:13.840 --> 03:11:19.840]   I was the last few days before that and with my crew thinking we need a new symbol for the Info War.
[03:11:19.840 --> 03:11:27.840]   And I want it to be something that's a cross, but I don't want it to be associated with the establishment, evil, synthetic Christianity.
[03:11:27.840 --> 03:11:31.840]   I want it to be about the defense of Christendom and the defense of the West.
[03:11:31.840 --> 03:11:37.840]   And then as sure as the sun came up, was it Monday? Was it last Friday? What day was it you last hosted?
[03:11:37.840 --> 03:11:38.840]   Friday.
[03:11:38.840 --> 03:11:41.840]   So it was last Friday. I'm in my car to take care of some errands.
[03:11:41.840 --> 03:11:45.840]   And I hear you talking about that cross of St. James and I already knew that cross.
[03:11:45.840 --> 03:11:52.840]   And I went, "Oh my God, next time I talk to Matt Bracken, that's the symbol that Info Wars is going to adopt."
[03:11:52.840 --> 03:11:55.840]   Because I already knew the symbol. I've been to Spain. I know the history of it.
[03:11:55.840 --> 03:12:04.840]   I know that like you said, 500 to 700 years of La Reconquista, millions dead, the rest of Europe, the crusades starting there as a defense.
[03:12:04.840 --> 03:12:07.840]   And that's really it. So this is going to be my symbol.
[03:12:07.840 --> 03:12:11.840]   And I think the Vlad Tepes blog, people can go there, get themselves one.
[03:12:11.840 --> 03:12:15.840]   But absolutely, we're going to come out with these in silver as well, on shirts.
[03:12:15.840 --> 03:12:16.840]   Everyone should adopt this.
[03:12:16.840 --> 03:12:23.840]   I'm telling you, this is a gift from God because I was already thinking the same thing the last few days in meetings.
[03:12:23.840 --> 03:12:30.840]   Trying to come up with a cross symbol that's original for Info Wars that telegraphs who we are and this is it.
[03:12:30.840 --> 03:12:32.840]   So I'm telling you, this is meant to happen.
[03:12:32.840 --> 03:12:39.840]   Yeah, I'm actually, I'm really promoting this for patches, you know, what they call morale patches.
[03:12:39.840 --> 03:12:48.840]   There's a company that called 144.1, which is a psalm about the Lord teaching my hands to prepare for war.
[03:12:48.840 --> 03:12:51.840]   So it's actually in the Bible, Psalm 144.
[03:12:51.840 --> 03:12:57.840]   They have a website where they sell what they call morale patches and they're going to start making these also.
[03:12:57.840 --> 03:13:02.840]   This is, you know, different, you know, Gadsden symbols, things like that.
[03:13:02.840 --> 03:13:08.840]   This needs to join the Gadsden. This needs to join the 1776, the 3%, because it's older than all that.
[03:13:08.840 --> 03:13:10.840]   And if it wasn't for this, we wouldn't be here.
[03:13:10.840 --> 03:13:14.840]   That's right. And it's going to take a real shift in the mentality.
[03:13:14.840 --> 03:13:23.840]   And I welcome the opportunity to debate because anybody who's who reflexively, you know, brainwashed pacifists who reflexively say,
[03:13:23.840 --> 03:13:25.840]   but Jesus said, turn the other cheek.
[03:13:25.840 --> 03:13:29.840]   It will know Jesus never said commit suicide through pacifism.
[03:13:29.840 --> 03:13:32.840]   And it wasn't. Let's go back to that quote since you mentioned it.
[03:13:32.840 --> 03:13:37.840]   That's a powerful quote. Put that quote back up up, guys, please.
[03:13:37.840 --> 03:13:45.840]   That's a Psalm of David. Bless be he the Lord, my strength, which teaches my hands to war and my fingers to fight.
[03:13:45.840 --> 03:13:54.840]   Right. Because otherwise you're just going to be wiped out by the next pack of Mongols or jihadists that comes along.
[03:13:54.840 --> 03:14:01.840]   You know, there are there are vicious groups out there and their formula is to be so vicious that people will just surrender.
[03:14:01.840 --> 03:14:07.840]   You know, the Mongols and the jihadists use the same exact formula when they would approach a walled city.
[03:14:07.840 --> 03:14:17.840]   They would send out an emissary and they would say, if you surrender and you agree to pay the tribute and do whatever we say, you know, send us women, feed, feed our armies.
[03:14:17.840 --> 03:14:24.840]   Then we won't massacre you. But if you resist, we're going to massacre your men and slave your women and children.
[03:14:24.840 --> 03:14:30.840]   And they would do it so that it was a Mongol formula. And then later it was Mohammed's formula.
[03:14:30.840 --> 03:14:37.840]   And you know what's really fascinating to me, where these two battle strategies met was in the Crimea.
[03:14:37.840 --> 03:14:42.840]   And guess what? The Mongol, the Crimean Tatars became Muslims.
[03:14:42.840 --> 03:14:51.840]   So when it came to out brutalizing one another, the Mohammedans out brutalized the Mongol horde, the Tatars.
[03:14:51.840 --> 03:14:58.840]   So the Tatars didn't defeat the Mohammedans. The Mohammedans, the Tatars came into that region.
[03:14:58.840 --> 03:15:01.840]   But a century later, guess what? They're all Islamic.
[03:15:01.840 --> 03:15:09.840]   So, I mean, you know, you can't you can't throw rose petals at jihadists or win them over with poetry verses.
[03:15:09.840 --> 03:15:12.840]   And then we have Albania invading Serbia. They even admit started the war.
[03:15:12.840 --> 03:15:15.840]   And our media says Serbia is to blame for defending itself.
[03:15:15.840 --> 03:15:20.840]   Thank God Russia went into Pristina and didn't let them take the whole damn country.
[03:15:20.840 --> 03:15:28.840]   You know, that's that's a whole nother issue. You know, it's easy for people like in Holland or Sweden to virtue signal.
[03:15:28.840 --> 03:15:33.840]   But when you're a Serb and you've been living literally in the trenches, you know, for hundreds of years,
[03:15:33.840 --> 03:15:38.840]   the only way you're not going to be Islamified is by becoming a tough son of a bitch.
[03:15:38.840 --> 03:15:43.840]   Well, they come to kill you. You're going to have to kill. And I'm sorry I tried to stop all this.
[03:15:43.840 --> 03:15:46.840]   I tried to stop the destabilized the Middle East and breaking the borders.
[03:15:46.840 --> 03:15:50.840]   But the globalists succeeded. So now we have to prepare for war.
[03:15:50.840 --> 03:15:52.840]   Matt Bracken takes over. Stay with us.

[03:19:23.840 --> 03:19:29.840]   to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park,

[03:19:59.840 --> 03:20:21.840]   Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:21.840 --> 03:20:25.840]   And now, your host, Matt Bracken.
[03:20:25.840 --> 03:20:29.840]   Okay, it's good to be back.
[03:20:29.840 --> 03:20:36.840]   And I find it really amazing that Alex heard that episode last Friday when I was talking about the St. James Cross.
[03:20:36.840 --> 03:20:40.840]   It's this symbol, for anybody that missed the last segment.
[03:20:40.840 --> 03:20:45.840]   It's the symbol of Christians that are going to fight back and resist with force of arms.
[03:20:45.840 --> 03:20:52.840]   And anyway, look for that one, hats, patches, stickers, etc. going forward.
[03:20:52.840 --> 03:20:54.840]   As you can see, I'm wearing one right now.
[03:20:54.840 --> 03:20:59.840]   Now, in this first segment, I've got a little talk to give.
[03:20:59.840 --> 03:21:02.840]   But after that, we're going to take some calls.
[03:21:02.840 --> 03:21:08.840]   And the call-in number is 877-789-2539.
[03:21:08.840 --> 03:21:12.840]   That's 877-789-ALEX.
[03:21:12.840 --> 03:21:16.840]   And we'll be taking calls in the next segments after this.
[03:21:16.840 --> 03:21:20.840]   So, I'm not sure if I'm going to start doing podcasts.
[03:21:20.840 --> 03:21:26.840]   People are asking if I'm going to or making my own videos.
[03:21:26.840 --> 03:21:29.840]   There are so many great ones out there.
[03:21:29.840 --> 03:21:33.840]   I always look for Black Pigeon Speaks, Iconoclast.
[03:21:33.840 --> 03:21:37.840]   There's a lot that are really worth watching, in my opinion.
[03:21:37.840 --> 03:21:38.840]   Too many to list here.
[03:21:38.840 --> 03:21:40.840]   Those are two of my favorites.
[03:21:40.840 --> 03:21:43.840]   And I don't know if I can even get into their league.
[03:21:43.840 --> 03:21:46.840]   But I do occasionally write some stuff.
[03:21:46.840 --> 03:21:50.840]   And, in fact, besides novels, I have a lot of short works.
[03:21:50.840 --> 03:21:58.840]   And I'm putting together a printed version of my anthology now that's updated with my newer stuff up to this past year.
[03:21:58.840 --> 03:22:01.840]   Now, this is one that I haven't written.
[03:22:01.840 --> 03:22:04.840]   It's not in any book or essay yet.
[03:22:04.840 --> 03:22:09.840]   But I call this "Rules for Deep State Overlords."
[03:22:09.840 --> 03:22:23.840]   And this is basically the handbook for how to take over a country and then maintain your own power against the will of the people in the modern era.
[03:22:23.840 --> 03:22:25.840]   And I'm going to go through these.
[03:22:25.840 --> 03:22:26.840]   They're numbered.
[03:22:26.840 --> 03:22:29.840]   I might write an essay or do a video.
[03:22:29.840 --> 03:22:33.840]   And you can help me out if you think I missed anything here.
[03:22:33.840 --> 03:22:37.840]   Number one is maybe the stickiest and the hardest.
[03:22:37.840 --> 03:22:43.840]   And it's unique to the United States and only a few other countries because it's pretty hard to accomplish this.
[03:22:43.840 --> 03:22:48.840]   Rule number one is disarm the population in the name of public safety.
[03:22:48.840 --> 03:22:55.840]   This is almost, in every case, a mandatory requirement of a deep state tyranny.
[03:22:55.840 --> 03:22:57.840]   You have to disarm the peasants.
[03:22:57.840 --> 03:23:02.840]   Even in Venezuela, they did it a year or two before they really put on the screws.
[03:23:02.840 --> 03:23:11.840]   Every country from Armenia to Germany in the '30s, the Armenians were wiped out after they were disarmed.
[03:23:11.840 --> 03:23:14.840]   The reason given was public safety.
[03:23:14.840 --> 03:23:19.840]   The problem in the United States for the deep state overlords is the Constitution.
[03:23:19.840 --> 03:23:21.840]   It's in the Constitution.
[03:23:21.840 --> 03:23:28.840]   So they've got to find workarounds, and that generally involves putting corrupt judges into positions of power.
[03:23:28.840 --> 03:23:42.840]   Now, number two on the list is you have to make sure that your police, especially, and the military have their own separate pay channels, housing, access to food.
[03:23:42.840 --> 03:23:52.840]   So even if the supermarkets are being looted, even if the ATMs aren't working, you have to make sure that your police and your military are going to get paid.
[03:23:52.840 --> 03:24:01.840]   They'll feel secure, and then they'll be willing to go out and crack heads among the rabble outside of the bases.
[03:24:01.840 --> 03:24:04.840]   But they need to have their own supply lines.
[03:24:04.840 --> 03:24:08.840]   That's pretty much accomplished already in most modern countries.
[03:24:08.840 --> 03:24:10.840]   That's no problem.
[03:24:10.840 --> 03:24:21.840]   Now, then you need to stealthily recruit a permanent voting block of useful idiots, and you do this by promising them free stuff.
[03:24:21.840 --> 03:24:24.840]   And how do you recruit a moron?
[03:24:24.840 --> 03:24:26.840]   You promise them a free lunch.
[03:24:26.840 --> 03:24:30.840]   By definition, there's no such thing, but morons don't know that.
[03:24:30.840 --> 03:24:34.840]   This ties in with something called the Dunning-Kruger effect.
[03:24:34.840 --> 03:24:45.840]   The Dunning-Kruger effect is a psychological paradigm where people who are really dumb are too dumb to know how dumb they are, and they think they're actually smart.
[03:24:45.840 --> 03:24:58.840]   So when an Ocasio-Cortez comes along and says, "We're going to have a green revolution and give everybody everything for free, and we're not going to listen to those mean Republicans," these dummies actually believe it.
[03:24:58.840 --> 03:25:03.840]   So the Democrats are recruiting Dunning-Kruger Democrats.
[03:25:03.840 --> 03:25:12.840]   She's a Dunning-Kruger leader recruiting more Dunning-Kruger lemmings, and preferably these candidates should be as dumb as possible.
[03:25:12.840 --> 03:25:16.840]   If they're illiterate and don't speak English, that's even better.
[03:25:16.840 --> 03:25:24.840]   If they have special needs, better still because they'll require tons of government workers to take care of and nurture them.
[03:25:24.840 --> 03:25:33.840]   Now, the next step is promote conditions of violence, criminality, and anarchy.
[03:25:33.840 --> 03:25:46.840]   A writer named Sam Francis wrote about this in 2004 in an article called "Anarcho-Tyranny, Where Multiculturalism Leads."
[03:25:46.840 --> 03:25:50.840]   It's not an accident that Venezuela looks like it does.
[03:25:50.840 --> 03:26:10.840]   Under conditions of anarcho-tyranny, the government has all the justification that it needs to establish a permanent state of emergency with anti-terrorism laws, special police powers to raid anybody at any time, a cloak of secrecy over top of all of their covert actions.
[03:26:10.840 --> 03:26:17.840]   So it's not an accident that they jam hostile ethnic and religious groups together.
[03:26:17.840 --> 03:26:23.840]   It's not like they didn't realize this would result in a social catastrophe.
[03:26:23.840 --> 03:26:37.840]   They understand it, but from their castles on the hill, it actually works to their benefit to have the peasants at each other's throats because then they can use the force of the military to crack down on any of their enemies.
[03:26:37.840 --> 03:26:46.840]   So you look at a country like Germany, Britain, France, they're actually arresting people for mean social media comments.
[03:26:46.840 --> 03:26:52.840]   So under the rubric of "We've got to stop terrorism," they don't actually stop the jihad invasion.
[03:26:52.840 --> 03:26:55.840]   What they do is they stop people from complaining about it.
[03:26:55.840 --> 03:27:11.840]   So next, number four, you can use algorithms and data mining to create like a pecking order of your most loyal comrades to the renegades, the troublemakers.
[03:27:11.840 --> 03:27:18.840]   I call them the effective resistors or the potential rivals.
[03:27:18.840 --> 03:27:24.840]   Effective resistors and potential rivals are the biggest danger to the overlords.
[03:27:24.840 --> 03:27:32.840]   The average person will put up with almost any amount of deprivation as long as they're not absolutely starving.
[03:27:32.840 --> 03:27:40.840]   But it's those pesky resistors that have to be dealt with because they can gain a following.
[03:27:40.840 --> 03:27:44.840]   They can actually get a lot of people to follow them.
[03:27:44.840 --> 03:27:50.840]   Fortunately for the deep state overlords, they can just piggyback on top of social media.
[03:27:50.840 --> 03:28:14.840]   So their stooges at Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google can do the heavy lifting for them, and then the deep state overlords can just piggyback on top of that and put their thumb on the scale where necessary to make sure that troublesome, pesky gadflies, the effective resistors, the potential rivals, are throttled and have their volume turned way, way down.
[03:28:14.840 --> 03:28:19.840]   So that's got us up to number four now on the rules for deep state overlords.
[03:28:19.840 --> 03:28:23.840]   And I'm going to come back after this break, and we're going to go through the rest of them.
[03:28:23.840 --> 03:28:39.840]   And I hope you find this interesting and informative because we are being played, and it's up to us to figure out how to be effective resistors and how to actually not get our volume throttled down to where we have no impact.
[03:28:39.840 --> 03:28:43.840]   I'm doing pretty well getting on Alex Jones' show, I'll tell you what.
[03:28:43.840 --> 03:28:47.840]   So thanks, Alex, for the use of your fantastic platform.

[03:31:52.840 --> 03:32:02.840]   The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[03:32:02.840 --> 03:32:11.840]   It literally dumbs the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:32:11.840 --> 03:32:17.840]   First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:32:17.840 --> 03:32:23.840]   So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:32:23.840 --> 03:32:31.840]   Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:32:31.840 --> 03:32:44.840]   But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:32:44.840 --> 03:32:52.840]   Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery. X3 now available at mflaworslife.com.
[03:32:52.840 --> 03:32:59.840]   You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:01.840 --> 03:33:06.840]   The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:06.840 --> 03:33:09.840]   It's Matt Bracken.
[03:33:09.840 --> 03:33:12.840]   You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:14.840 --> 03:33:20.840]   The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:20.840 --> 03:33:23.840]   It's Matt Bracken.
[03:33:23.840 --> 03:33:26.840]   You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:26.840 --> 03:33:38.840]   Okay, during the next segment, we'll take some phone calls at 877-789-2539.
[03:33:38.840 --> 03:33:41.840]   That's 789-ALEX.
[03:33:42.840 --> 03:33:46.840]   But I want to finish up my rules for deep state overlords.
[03:33:46.840 --> 03:33:57.840]   We got through number four, which was use algorithms and data mining and social media to, in a private way, sort of do what China's doing with the social credit system.
[03:33:57.840 --> 03:34:10.840]   It's not such a blunt instrument here yet that you can't get on a train, but they can certainly take away your Patreon account or make it impossible for you to use credit cards like they have done to some conservatives.
[03:34:10.840 --> 03:34:20.840]   Just because they get brigaded, which means the liberals gang up on somebody and put in a ton of complaints saying that so-and-so is a hater or a Nazi or a racist.
[03:34:20.840 --> 03:34:22.840]   The next thing you know, you're an un-person.
[03:34:22.840 --> 03:34:26.840]   So that's how they do it in the land of the free as opposed to communist China.
[03:34:26.840 --> 03:34:37.840]   Now, number five on the rules for overlords is make sure that the media is a fully integrated part of the DSO team, the deep state overlord team.
[03:34:37.840 --> 03:34:57.840]   The owners and the major talking heads of the major networks, with Fox being in a gray area, its own special case, but the ABC and NBCBS, those guys, Time, Newsweek, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, New York Times, these are the bellwether leading media sites.
[03:34:57.840 --> 03:35:02.840]   They're the ones that set the standard for what's truthful and valid and legit.
[03:35:02.840 --> 03:35:07.840]   Make sure that all of those owners are made members of the deep state.
[03:35:07.840 --> 03:35:11.840]   Their kids are going to go to the same colleges with your kids.
[03:35:11.840 --> 03:35:13.840]   When they get out, they'll take turns interning.
[03:35:13.840 --> 03:35:15.840]   Your kid will intern for me.
[03:35:15.840 --> 03:35:17.840]   My kid will intern for you.
[03:35:17.840 --> 03:35:28.840]   And we all meet at the Cape or meet at Doral, and we conduct our business privately, but we all know that we're all on the same team.
[03:35:28.840 --> 03:35:35.840]   This is how you wind up with guys like Anderson Cooper, whose parents were CIA from all the way back.
[03:35:35.840 --> 03:35:40.840]   This is basically the modern extension of Operation Mockingbird.
[03:35:40.840 --> 03:35:42.840]   And now they're not even hiding it.
[03:35:42.840 --> 03:35:50.840]   You see Brennan and Clapper on network television, and these guys are the epitome of deep state overlords.
[03:35:50.840 --> 03:36:04.840]   So in our country, just like the way that Facebook gives a private look, a private veneer to the social credit system, in America we have Pravda, but we have Pravda with a bunch of channels.
[03:36:04.840 --> 03:36:07.840]   But all the wires in the back are connected to the same outlet.
[03:36:07.840 --> 03:36:12.840]   So it gives the veneer of a free press.
[03:36:12.840 --> 03:36:25.840]   But if all there is is a monolithic liberal media, and then they can just say, "Well, Fox, I mean, only Hannity's talking about that and the Kooks, Alex Jones, Rush Limbaugh, they don't count."
[03:36:25.840 --> 03:36:33.840]   So as long as they have a plurality of the deep state media, they can just stick to their airtight narrative no matter what.
[03:36:33.840 --> 03:36:39.840]   Like Baghdad Bob before the tanks rolled into Baghdad, they'll stick to the narrative.
[03:36:39.840 --> 03:36:42.840]   So it's critical that you have the media.
[03:36:42.840 --> 03:36:56.840]   That's how you can get away with, say, an Operation Fast and Furious, hundreds of dead Mexicans, and no reporters reporting about where the guns came from or how they were pushed to the cartels in order to smear the Second Amendment.
[03:36:56.840 --> 03:36:59.840]   I mean, that was a murder operation.
[03:36:59.840 --> 03:37:01.840]   Fast and Furious was a murder operation.
[03:37:01.840 --> 03:37:10.840]   When they got away with that, when the media firewalls held, then the Obama and Hillary Clinton administration, they knew they could get away with anything.
[03:37:10.840 --> 03:37:12.840]   They could sell our uranium.
[03:37:12.840 --> 03:37:15.840]   They could not rescue the people in Benghazi.
[03:37:15.840 --> 03:37:19.840]   They knew that the media would cover them no matter what.
[03:37:19.840 --> 03:37:30.840]   Okay, number six, weaponize and politicize law enforcement, especially the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the intel agencies.
[03:37:30.840 --> 03:37:43.840]   Well, for the last at least 10 years, my sources tell me that to get into the FBI, you practically, you have to at least fake that you're a social justice warrior or you will never pass their intake screening.
[03:37:43.840 --> 03:37:47.840]   You have to prove that in college you were a good comrade.
[03:37:47.840 --> 03:37:55.840]   So they're bringing through the ranks the comrades, and they're promoting up the ranks the comrades.
[03:37:55.840 --> 03:38:10.840]   That's how you get people like Peter Strzok as this sort of James Bond figure between all of, you know, saving Hillary from Uranium One and the email server, and then transitioning into the deep state coup against Trump.
[03:38:10.840 --> 03:38:15.840]   These are all SES, Senior Executive Service members.
[03:38:15.840 --> 03:38:23.840]   And I'm not saying that all of the couple thousand SES members in the country are corrupt and are social justice warriors.
[03:38:23.840 --> 03:38:30.840]   But even if a third of them are, that's enough because what they do is it's a term you need to understand called backstopping.
[03:38:30.840 --> 03:38:32.840]   They backstop one another.
[03:38:32.840 --> 03:38:45.840]   You know that you can get your friends off and you can nail your enemies because you know that the FBI agent will lie on his 302s, then charge somebody with 1001 lying to FBI.
[03:38:45.840 --> 03:38:48.840]   They know that corrupt judges will back them up.
[03:38:48.840 --> 03:38:59.840]   They know that between the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the corrupt federal judges who are all social justice warriors, they can get away with anything.
[03:38:59.840 --> 03:39:12.840]   Now, after number six, number seven is when the social media throttling is not effective, when somehow somebody's cutting through, like say a Tucker Carlson, then you have to turn the screws up.
[03:39:12.840 --> 03:39:28.840]   And what they do is they look at these enemies, these bad comrades from a deep state intelligence apparatus point of view as if they were a Mission Impossible team in an enemy territory and their job was to destroy somebody.
[03:39:28.840 --> 03:39:32.840]   And they'll look at it from all angles and say, well, we can't just shoot the guy.
[03:39:32.840 --> 03:39:40.840]   We'll have to rig up a defamation case against them as a racist, which they're doing against Carlson right now.
[03:39:40.840 --> 03:39:49.840]   We'll have to maybe insert some false information, defamatory information about a false sexual history.
[03:39:49.840 --> 03:40:03.840]   If that doesn't work, if defamation, ridicule, throttling so that you have no reach with your audience, if none of that works, these people absolutely are not above moving on to wet operations.
[03:40:03.840 --> 03:40:09.840]   And what I mean is putting something, doing something that can sicken somebody.
[03:40:09.840 --> 03:40:11.840]   Instant heart attack is not out of the question.
[03:40:11.840 --> 03:40:15.840]   The technology has been available for decades and decades.
[03:40:15.840 --> 03:40:22.840]   And I think of people like Andrew Breitbart or Seth Rich or more lately in San Diego, Bray Payton.
[03:40:22.840 --> 03:40:27.840]   And I wonder, you know, they're not going to walk up and shoot somebody in the head.
[03:40:27.840 --> 03:40:29.840]   They're going to have to make it look plausible.
[03:40:29.840 --> 03:40:39.840]   You know, it's either going to be a street hit or an instant heart attack or, you know, instant swine flu and you're dead in 24 hours.
[03:40:39.840 --> 03:40:41.840]   This is crazy stuff.
[03:40:41.840 --> 03:40:42.840]   But these people are not above it.
[03:40:42.840 --> 03:40:49.840]   Remember, they did Operation Fast and Furious knowing hundreds of Mexicans would be killed.
[03:40:49.840 --> 03:40:57.840]   And they did it so that they could get rid of the Second Amendment or try to curtail our ability to buy semi-automatic rifles.
[03:40:57.840 --> 03:41:00.840]   This brings us back to number one.
[03:41:00.840 --> 03:41:03.840]   You have to disarm the population.
[03:41:03.840 --> 03:41:07.840]   That's the trickiest part for them because we've seen the play.
[03:41:07.840 --> 03:41:16.840]   We know how the Armenians, the Jews in Germany, the Tutsis in Rwanda, first they're disarmed, then they're scapegoated.
[03:41:16.840 --> 03:41:19.840]   And scapegoating serves a purpose of the deep state.
[03:41:19.840 --> 03:41:26.840]   It takes the attention of the unhappy masses off of the incompetently run economy, for example.
[03:41:26.840 --> 03:41:31.840]   And focuses it on an enemy that the deep state would also like to see eliminated.
[03:41:31.840 --> 03:41:45.840]   You know, the landowning Kulaks, the landowners in China, you know, any group that the deep state would like to see out of the way will conveniently become the scapegoat for the anger of the masses.
[03:41:45.840 --> 03:41:51.840]   But first, they've got to do that tricky operation of disarming the population.
[03:41:51.840 --> 03:42:02.840]   And that's where I think that their plan is going to fall short because they can't just grind this country into tyranny, which is what they're intending and trying fully to do.
[03:42:02.840 --> 03:42:10.840]   If Hillary had won, if there was a Democrat Congress right now, we'd be on the road to Venezuela, absolutely.
[03:42:10.840 --> 03:42:17.840]   But the best they can do, or maybe the worst, is foment the conditions for a civil war.
[03:42:17.840 --> 03:42:25.840]   They can't just cleanly get away with imposing a tyranny on us, not until we're disarmed.
[03:42:25.840 --> 03:42:28.840]   And that's why we'll never give up our guns.
[03:42:28.840 --> 03:42:33.840]   And if you, you know, what I always say, if you're going to go buy ammunition, buy it by the case.
[03:42:33.840 --> 03:42:36.840]   If ammo's worth buying, it's worth buying a lot.
[03:42:36.840 --> 03:42:39.840]   Because I think in the years to come, we're going to need it all.
[03:42:39.840 --> 03:42:44.840]   And when we come back on the other side of this break, then I'm going to go straight to the phone calls.
[03:42:44.840 --> 03:42:46.840]   See you in a minute.
[03:42:46.840 --> 03:42:52.840]   [Music]
[03:42:52.840 --> 03:42:56.840]   Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:42:56.840 --> 03:42:59.840]   The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:42:59.840 --> 03:43:05.840]   But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:43:05.840 --> 03:43:13.840]   Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:43:13.840 --> 03:43:19.840]   To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:43:19.840 --> 03:43:25.840]   What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:43:25.840 --> 03:43:29.840]   Next, we tested the water from our AlexaPure gravity filter.
[03:43:29.840 --> 03:43:36.840]   And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:43:36.840 --> 03:43:41.840]   As it turns out, the filter on the AlexaPure raises the pH of the water.
[03:43:41.840 --> 03:43:47.840]   So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:43:47.840 --> 03:43:52.840]   But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:43:52.840 --> 03:43:56.840]   Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[03:43:56.840 --> 03:44:00.840]   And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with InfoWars.
[03:44:00.840 --> 03:44:02.840]   Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[03:44:02.840 --> 03:44:05.840]   They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[03:44:05.840 --> 03:44:12.840]   But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be in a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[03:44:12.840 --> 03:44:17.840]   Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[03:44:17.840 --> 03:44:23.840]   But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future.
[03:44:23.840 --> 03:44:26.840]   I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[03:44:26.840 --> 03:44:27.840]   I want to keep going.
[03:44:27.840 --> 03:44:31.840]   I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[03:44:31.840 --> 03:44:33.840]   I want to push all the way.
[03:44:33.840 --> 03:44:34.840]   I've committed to do that.
[03:44:34.840 --> 03:44:35.840]   I've prayed for that.
[03:44:35.840 --> 03:44:37.840]   And I've been told that's going to happen.
[03:44:37.840 --> 03:44:38.840]   But you've got a back issue.
[03:44:38.840 --> 03:44:40.840]   And I promise you this.
[03:44:40.840 --> 03:44:41.840]   I will never falter.
[03:44:41.840 --> 03:44:43.840]   I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[03:44:43.840 --> 03:44:44.840]   I physically will.
[03:44:44.840 --> 03:44:46.840]   But I give you my commitment.
[03:44:46.840 --> 03:44:52.840]   If you financially support us, then for sure, I come to give you my absolute total commitment.
[03:44:52.840 --> 03:45:03.840]   We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:45:03.840 --> 03:45:08.840]   That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[03:45:08.840 --> 03:45:10.840]   It's made in the USA.
[03:45:10.840 --> 03:45:15.840]   It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body.
[03:45:15.840 --> 03:45:17.840]   And it supports the info war.
[03:45:17.840 --> 03:45:19.840]   It is a classical 360 win.
[03:45:19.840 --> 03:45:22.840]   This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[03:45:22.840 --> 03:45:28.840]   And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:45:28.840 --> 03:45:38.840]   You owe it to yourself. You owe it to your family. And you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[03:45:38.840 --> 03:45:45.840]   Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:45:45.840 --> 03:45:48.840]   Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[03:45:48.840 --> 03:45:52.840]   Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and Infowarslife.com.
[03:45:52.840 --> 03:45:59.840]   Defeat the globalists, #AlexJones. Defeat the pedophiles, #AlexJones.
[03:45:59.840 --> 03:46:04.840]   Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with #AlexJones.
[03:46:04.840 --> 03:46:08.840]   Defeat the censors with #AlexJones.
[03:46:08.840 --> 03:46:17.840]   They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with #AlexJones.
[03:46:17.840 --> 03:46:22.840]   I am patient zero in the mass of banning, but you can override the censors now.
[03:46:22.840 --> 03:46:27.840]   And if all of our audience gets involved with #AlexJones, we are unstoppable together.
[03:46:27.840 --> 03:46:31.840]   We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[03:46:31.840 --> 03:46:37.840]   Do it again with #AlexJones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[03:46:37.840 --> 03:46:42.840]   Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public, #AlexJones.
[03:46:42.840 --> 03:46:45.840]   That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[03:46:47.840 --> 03:46:52.840]   Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[03:46:52.840 --> 03:46:59.840]   You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:01.840 --> 03:47:16.840]   [Music]
[03:47:16.840 --> 03:47:18.840]   Waging war on corruption.
[03:47:18.840 --> 03:47:23.840]   It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[03:47:23.840 --> 03:47:26.840]   [Music]
[03:47:26.840 --> 03:47:36.840]   Okay, last segment we're going to be taking phone calls, but I forgot to mention that one of my novels, Domestic Enemies, the Reconquista, it's free on Kindle today.
[03:47:36.840 --> 03:47:44.840]   So if you go to Amazon, my Kindle page, you can download my Southwest Civil War novel, Domestic Enemies.
[03:47:44.840 --> 03:47:50.840]   Anyway, let's get right to the phone calls, and we're going to have to go through them quick because we only got one segment here.
[03:47:50.840 --> 03:47:54.840]   So, Sean in New Jersey, what have you got for me?
[03:47:54.840 --> 03:47:56.840]   Something about the Second Amendment.
[03:47:56.840 --> 03:47:58.840]   Go ahead.
[03:47:58.840 --> 03:48:01.840]   How's it going, Matt? How are you doing today, brother?
[03:48:01.840 --> 03:48:03.840]   Great, thanks.
[03:48:03.840 --> 03:48:05.840]   Happy New Year's and God bless.
[03:48:05.840 --> 03:48:07.840]   Yeah, I don't know how you stand it in New Jersey.
[03:48:07.840 --> 03:48:10.840]   Did you turn in all your 30-round magazines?
[03:48:10.840 --> 03:48:14.840]   Um, I plead the fifth.
[03:48:14.840 --> 03:48:16.840]   I'll bet.
[03:48:16.840 --> 03:48:18.840]   Okay, go ahead.
[03:48:18.840 --> 03:48:21.840]   Here's the deal. I'm a follower of Guns and Gadgets.
[03:48:21.840 --> 03:48:29.840]   He's a cop in Massachusetts, and he covers every state when it comes to the Second Amendment.
[03:48:29.840 --> 03:48:34.840]   The Democrats have this new bill. It's SB11-something.
[03:48:34.840 --> 03:48:42.840]   And it's their first bill they're going to try to push through the House, other than obstructing President Trump and the wall that we want.
[03:48:42.840 --> 03:48:44.840]   Right.
[03:48:44.840 --> 03:48:46.840]   It is the absolute death of the Second Amendment.
[03:48:46.840 --> 03:48:57.840]   It's the death of being able to manufacture a firearm and not having to register it so long as it meets the requirements for personal use.
[03:48:57.840 --> 03:49:03.840]   It's needing to go to an FFL to get a gun part.
[03:49:03.840 --> 03:49:05.840]   It's ridiculous.
[03:49:05.840 --> 03:49:22.840]   When are we the people going to wake up and realize that no matter whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, you all live behind high walls, you're protected by the guns you want to take away from us, and it is absolutely disgraceful.
[03:49:22.840 --> 03:49:28.840]   And all they do is pass laws that walk all over our Constitution.
[03:49:28.840 --> 03:49:40.840]   Well, Sean, I wrote something a couple years ago, an essay called Dear Mr. Security Agent, and it's primarily directed to federal law enforcement agents, but all law enforcement.
[03:49:40.840 --> 03:49:52.840]   It's not going to be the Manhattan and Malibu elites that are going to have to strap on the body armor and kick down the doors when they finally say we've got to actually go confiscate these things.
[03:49:52.840 --> 03:49:55.840]   It's going to be cops and federal agents.
[03:49:55.840 --> 03:50:06.840]   And I want to tell them right here up front, buddy, any gun that was legal as say, you know, five years ago, if you try to pass the magic wand and say this gun is now makes you a criminal.
[03:50:06.840 --> 03:50:08.840]   Well, I'm going to keep the gun.
[03:50:08.840 --> 03:50:11.840]   And when you come and get it, you're going to get the bullets first.
[03:50:11.840 --> 03:50:17.840]   And, you know, after a while, there won't be enough federal agents because they're just going to run out of the numbers.
[03:50:17.840 --> 03:50:29.840]   They're just outnumbered a thousand to one by deer rifles, you know, 400 yard deer rifles fired one shot at a time will put an end to gun confiscation pretty fast.
[03:50:29.840 --> 03:50:39.840]   It's easy for politicians and professors and movie Hollywood types to talk about this, but it's going to be the cops and the federal agents that have to do the dirty work.
[03:50:39.840 --> 03:50:41.840]   And there just aren't enough of them.
[03:50:41.840 --> 03:50:47.840]   And if they're down for that struggle, then they're definitely an enemy of the Constitution.
[03:50:47.840 --> 03:50:50.840]   That's the oath we all took enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:50:50.840 --> 03:50:52.840]   I can read the Second Amendment.
[03:50:52.840 --> 03:50:57.840]   And you try to tell me that my Glock 19 or my air 15 is now illegal to possess.
[03:50:57.840 --> 03:50:59.840]   I say, screw you, baby.
[03:50:59.840 --> 03:51:01.840]   Come on, Mullen Lobby.
[03:51:01.840 --> 03:51:03.840]   Anyway, thanks, Sean.
[03:51:03.840 --> 03:51:05.840]   Let's get a Canadian perspective now.
[03:51:05.840 --> 03:51:09.840]   Alex and Canada, Canadian communism, it says.
[03:51:09.840 --> 03:51:12.840]   Alex, well, it's we're Canadian.
[03:51:12.840 --> 03:51:21.840]   So by listening and reading about your constitution, I would agree with it a little bit more because it's clear and it doesn't infringe on our rights.
[03:51:21.840 --> 03:51:23.840]   But thing is clear.
[03:51:23.840 --> 03:51:25.840]   Look at the French Canadian province, Quebec.
[03:51:25.840 --> 03:51:29.840]   They've just put registry on the firearms.
[03:51:29.840 --> 03:51:35.840]   We have to register our firearms, but it's the only province in Canada.
[03:51:35.840 --> 03:51:36.840]   It's something weird.
[03:51:36.840 --> 03:51:38.840]   And Ontario putting a law.
[03:51:38.840 --> 03:51:40.840]   I don't know if you heard about that.
[03:51:40.840 --> 03:51:52.840]   Well, if you have a few years ago, a few years ago, they tried to register the long arms and it was it was swamped with people putting in bogus, you know, registering hair dryers.
[03:51:52.840 --> 03:51:57.840]   And and they it became such a fiasco that even the liberals dropped it.
[03:51:57.840 --> 03:52:01.840]   Well, I wouldn't comply to their firearms here in Quebec.
[03:52:01.840 --> 03:52:04.840]   Don't and I wouldn't. I wouldn't.
[03:52:04.840 --> 03:52:08.840]   Or register one, you know, broken 38 or 22.
[03:52:08.840 --> 03:52:12.840]   And that's it just for the purposes of showing them something, maybe.
[03:52:12.840 --> 03:52:18.840]   But I wouldn't register anything with a scope on it or anything with it that takes a magazine.
[03:52:18.840 --> 03:52:22.840]   But I got to get through these. I got to get through these really quick.
[03:52:22.840 --> 03:52:25.840]   Thanks, Aaron in California.
[03:52:25.840 --> 03:52:28.840]   Turn the other cheek, he says.
[03:52:28.840 --> 03:52:30.840]   Go ahead, Aaron.
[03:52:30.840 --> 03:52:36.840]   Hello. You know, you said earlier about fighting back as a Christian.
[03:52:36.840 --> 03:52:43.840]   Right. Well, in my interpretation, when Jesus said to turn the other cheek, it's a turn of the cheek to fight back.
[03:52:43.840 --> 03:52:46.840]   You know, I'm saying.
[03:52:46.840 --> 03:52:55.840]   Well, I think that it was mainly meant in a family or a social sense, you know, like don't don't, you know, replay your neighbor's hostility with hostility.
[03:52:55.840 --> 03:53:04.840]   But just as with with Val, shout not murder being mistranslated intentionally into Del, shout not kill.
[03:53:04.840 --> 03:53:08.840]   Turn the other cheek became extended to just there should never be a war.
[03:53:08.840 --> 03:53:13.840]   You know, there's there's never a good reason for war. And obviously, that's that's ridiculous.
[03:53:13.840 --> 03:53:19.840]   I mean, if if the Nazis or the Imperial Japanese Army is coming, what, you're just supposed to surrender and offer your daughters to them.
[03:53:19.840 --> 03:53:23.840]   Forget it. No, there's no way.
[03:53:23.840 --> 03:53:27.840]   Let's see. Thanks, Aaron.
[03:53:27.840 --> 03:53:33.840]   Richard in New York has something about the St. James Cross. Go ahead, Richard.
[03:53:33.840 --> 03:53:44.840]   Yes, Matt. There is, you know, the St. James Cross may be a mystery, but there's an actual fact in the United States that people have failed to recognize.
[03:53:44.840 --> 03:53:50.840]   And and it's associated with two or three of the greatest spiritual mysteries on the face of the earth.
[03:53:50.840 --> 03:53:59.840]   They're located in the United States. And two of the mysteries are about the two witnesses before the Great Tribulation.
[03:53:59.840 --> 03:54:06.840]   And one of those witnesses is Michael, the archangel in the form of one of the two witnesses.
[03:54:06.840 --> 03:54:16.840]   Those two witnesses did appear in the United States down a dirt road sandwich between two mountains in our one of our Rocky Mountain states.
[03:54:16.840 --> 03:54:21.840]   Now, one of the where you get where where are you learning this from?
[03:54:21.840 --> 03:54:25.840]   I mean, is this like a Bible verse you're referring to or is this where is this coming from?
[03:54:25.840 --> 03:54:33.840]   Well, when it comes to turning out the cheek, the cheek is an avenue of the face and the face is a means of expression.
[03:54:33.840 --> 03:54:39.840]   So what it's really telling you is turn up your level of expression.
[03:54:39.840 --> 03:54:49.840]   And today's media, it is your free speech. Turn up your level of free speech. Don't be a doormat for these clowns.
[03:54:49.840 --> 03:54:54.840]   There's a there's a I agree. I agree. That's a that's a good way of look.
[03:54:54.840 --> 03:55:01.840]   That is a good way of looking at it. Thanks, Richard. I got I got to get through a few more calls in the limited time I got here.
[03:55:01.840 --> 03:55:07.840]   Wild man in Missouri. Go ahead, wild man.
[03:55:07.840 --> 03:55:11.840]   Now they're getting they're going to get around the Second Amendment with these red flag gun laws.
[03:55:11.840 --> 03:55:14.840]   They're passing them in state after state. They just passed it.
[03:55:14.840 --> 03:55:18.840]   Illinois, they signed it last week. They're getting reintroduced at Missouri.
[03:55:18.840 --> 03:55:22.840]   And what I think they're going to do in each state that they pass these red flag gun laws in,
[03:55:22.840 --> 03:55:26.840]   they're going to push their people, the Democrats in the left wing,
[03:55:26.840 --> 03:55:32.840]   to call in and make up false accusations on all the conservative gun owners they know.
[03:55:32.840 --> 03:55:36.840]   And then they go and take their guns away. Then then, you know, you don't know about it.
[03:55:36.840 --> 03:55:41.840]   Then you've got to go to court and try to prove what they said was false to get them back.
[03:55:41.840 --> 03:55:44.840]   Yeah, absolutely. One at a time.
[03:55:44.840 --> 03:55:52.840]   And not only and not only can they do that, they can they can combine that with swatting to make it sound like there's something terrible going on in the house.
[03:55:52.840 --> 03:55:57.840]   So while you're just sitting down eating dinner, here comes the SWAT team coming in heavy,
[03:55:57.840 --> 03:56:02.840]   hoping that you're going to reach for a gun so you can be a dead gun owner.
[03:56:02.840 --> 03:56:06.840]   But again, I got to get back to the police. Hey, police. Hey, hey, please.
[03:56:06.840 --> 03:56:11.840]   Federal law enforcement agents, it's going to be you at the front doors of these houses.
[03:56:11.840 --> 03:56:15.840]   And I'm telling you, it's not going to be smooth. You better think about the Second Amendment.
[03:56:15.840 --> 03:56:18.840]   You better think about the oath you took. Thanks a lot.
[03:56:18.840 --> 03:56:23.840]   Thanks a lot. Well, man, Jeff in Texas, we've got I think one more call if we can get it in.
[03:56:23.840 --> 03:56:27.840]   Jeff, go ahead. Hey, Matt.
[03:56:27.840 --> 03:56:33.840]   I'm just, you know, man, I feel totally and 100 percent agree that, you know,
[03:56:33.840 --> 03:56:37.840]   there is the globalist in the deep state actually exist and they're pulling lots of strings.
[03:56:37.840 --> 03:56:45.840]   However, I live in a small community in East Texas where, man, I just hadn't seen any of any of the signs yet.
[03:56:45.840 --> 03:56:51.840]   So my question is, man, what what can we do to recognize, you know, when they're coming to my neighborhood?
[03:56:51.840 --> 03:56:57.840]   And what can I do to help stop this? If you if you live out, if you live out in a rural area where, you know,
[03:56:57.840 --> 03:57:03.840]   your your food doesn't come from two thousand miles away, your water comes from underneath of your feet,
[03:57:03.840 --> 03:57:10.840]   then you're probably way off, better far ahead of most people, especially that live in the big cities.
[03:57:10.840 --> 03:57:16.840]   I would say just, you know, stay in shape, keep your eyes open when you see cities on fire, then you'll know.
[03:57:16.840 --> 03:57:26.840]   But, you know, if you're in rural Texas or Missouri or Montana, you know, just to keep doing what you're doing and lay in food for some bad years,
[03:57:26.840 --> 03:57:31.840]   food and ammunition and make sure you know where your water comes from under all conditions.
[03:57:31.840 --> 03:57:39.840]   All right. Thanks a lot. This is Matt Frackin. And I'll see you Thursday after next or whenever they ask me to come on in the meantime.
[03:57:39.840 --> 03:57:44.840]   And don't forget to download my book on Kindle.
[03:57:44.840 --> 03:57:49.840]   We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[03:57:49.840 --> 03:57:53.840]   Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[03:57:53.840 --> 03:57:57.840]   It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for. The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights,
[03:57:57.840 --> 03:58:04.840]   the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions. They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals
[03:58:04.840 --> 03:58:13.840]   taking those God-given rights from us as individuals. You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[03:58:13.840 --> 03:58:19.840]   We have seen what they want to do. They called it UN Agenda 21. Now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[03:58:19.840 --> 03:58:23.840]   They want everybody off of the rural lands. They want people out of the suburbs.
[03:58:23.840 --> 03:58:30.840]   They want to pack everybody into the cities because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
