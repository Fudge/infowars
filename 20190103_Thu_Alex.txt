[00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:19.289]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.498 --> 00:00:52.849]  Ladies and gentlemen, just kicked off another global transmission of the most demonized, most hated, most lied about broadcast in the world by corrupt global corporations, by chi-coms, by communists, by pedophiles, by scumbags, by fractional reserve banking cartels.
[00:00:52.849 --> 00:01:05.319]  Thank you so much for joining us as we steam into what I have predicted and what many others have predicted is going to be one hell of a tumultuous, out-of-control, dangerous year.
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:13.723]  There's going to be a lot of opportunity and also a lot of civil unrest, a lot of economic turmoil, I think a lot of war.
[00:01:13.723 --> 00:01:18.145]  So everybody better decide which side they're on.
[00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:19.946]  A lot of people don't even know what sides there are.
[00:01:20.868 --> 00:01:43.527]  That's why the globalists don't want this show on the air, because we're laying out from the globalist's own white papers, their own statements, how the cow ate the old cabbage, and creating a very accurate map for folks to overlay with the disinformation that they see in mainstream media, to try to then come up with a solution to counter the globalist technocracy.
[00:01:43.527 --> 00:01:46.369]  Obviously, Apple just tanked more than 10%.
[00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:54.229]  The stock market Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 650 points and still dropping.
[00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.910]  Oh, and Bloomberg's got the big headline right here.
[00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.691]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:01:58.691 --> 00:02:02.452]  It's up on Newswars.com.
[00:02:02.452 --> 00:02:06.114]  Bloomberg, the Trump slump.
[00:02:06.114 --> 00:02:08.815]  Why the market said goodbye to the Trump bump.
[00:02:10.077 --> 00:02:26.307]  Well, because the Federal Reserve raised a bunch of interest rates and signaled with regulations that the Democrats in the deep state were going to ignore all of the innovations and the attempt to release a lot of hidden technology to get us out of the technology slump.
[00:02:26.307 --> 00:02:30.090]  That they're blaming on the global market downturn right now.
[00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.732]  So they openly did this.
[00:02:32.732 --> 00:02:39.276]  And now they think you have no memory and that you're not going to remember what they've done.
[00:02:40.247 --> 00:02:46.390]  They're openly cheerleading for the economy implode, and then blaming Trump for it.
[00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:54.613]  Just like they've said in Europe, we're going to blame Italy for economic downturn, we're going to blame the UK for trying to get out of the unelected EU.
[00:02:54.613 --> 00:03:04.597]  It's the exact tactic of economic terrorism, but even bigger than the Federal Reserve, raising all these interest hikes than ever once did with Obama.
[00:03:04.597 --> 00:03:06.158]  They've now done, what, eight times with Trump.
[00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:08.106]  We're good to go.
[00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:41.310]  The fact that that Crypt Keeper is back in and the fact that this is being broadcast everywhere means that America won't be open for business and that we'll go back under the globalist plan to break our will, to demoralize us and create economic warfare.
[00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:50.873]  And of course we've got Nancy Pelosi's daughter wearing crazy cat lady glasses to hide the fact that her and her mother have gotten over a billion dollars with her dad since Nancy was in the house.
[00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:54.246]  She's a little trendy, non-threatening nerd.
[00:03:54.246 --> 00:03:57.588]  That's her camouflage for a vicious corporate witch.
[00:03:57.588 --> 00:04:05.833]  She's the same one that called for Trump's delegates not to be seated and for him to not be inaugurated on the 20th of 2017.
[00:04:05.833 --> 00:04:13.257]  When I said this was traitorous and outrageous, didn't call for her death or any violence, she went on Fox News and said I was calling for violence.
[00:04:13.257 --> 00:04:19.220]  And we confirmed that they approached the Justice Department and demanded that I be arrested.
[00:04:20.623 --> 00:04:23.925]  But it's okay, she's wearing pink Cat Lady glasses.
[00:04:23.925 --> 00:04:28.307]  So, if Hitler wore pink Cat Lady glasses, it'd be okay, right?
[00:04:28.307 --> 00:04:29.687]  And that's the whole leprechaun thing.
[00:04:29.687 --> 00:04:31.148]  Hi, everybody!
[00:04:31.148 --> 00:04:33.469]  We're not monstrous demons.
[00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:36.271]  We're not trying to sexualize your children or overthrow elections.
[00:04:36.271 --> 00:04:41.053]  No, my mommy didn't get a billion dollars with daddy since she's been in the house when she had nothing.
[00:04:41.053 --> 00:04:42.654]  We're not gangsters all mobbed up.
[00:04:42.654 --> 00:04:43.614]  No, no, no.
[00:04:43.614 --> 00:04:46.796]  Mob bosses look like Don Corleone.
[00:04:46.796 --> 00:04:47.596]  Or Scarface.
[00:04:47.596 --> 00:04:48.957]  They don't look like me.
[00:04:51.653 --> 00:04:53.514]  Just like a lot of, you know, people kidnap kids.
[00:04:53.514 --> 00:04:55.035]  Have a little ice cream truck.
[00:04:55.035 --> 00:04:56.136]  They wear little glasses.
[00:04:56.136 --> 00:04:57.197]  Got a puppy!
[00:04:57.197 --> 00:04:57.977]  Come on!
[00:04:57.977 --> 00:05:00.259]  Everything's okay.
[00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:09.565]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[00:05:09.565 --> 00:05:12.427]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[00:05:12.427 --> 00:05:18.451]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[00:05:19.131 --> 00:05:25.396]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[00:05:25.396 --> 00:05:31.682]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[00:05:31.682 --> 00:05:38.707]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[00:05:38.707 --> 00:05:38.927]  But!
[00:05:39.768 --> 00:05:52.783]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[00:05:52.783 --> 00:05:57.048]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[00:05:57.048 --> 00:05:59.731]  X3, now available at emplowerslife.com.
[00:06:06.841 --> 00:06:10.985]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[00:06:10.985 --> 00:06:15.188]  Resistance to titans is obedience to God.
[00:06:15.188 --> 00:06:17.110]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.470]  Wow!
[00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:33.277]  We're already into the third day of 2019.
[00:06:33.277 --> 00:06:42.599]  I'm your host Alex Jones and we're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:44.060]  to 3 p.m.
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.580]  Central Standard Time.
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:54.582]  The news websites are InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and when you share those links
[00:06:55.373 --> 00:07:09.140]  When you spread those articles, when you tell your neighbors and your friends and your church and your co-workers about InfoWars.com, when you spread the word, it is absolutely earth-changing.
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:15.863]  It is absolutely sending chills of fear into the spines and into the backbones of the globalists.
[00:07:16.752 --> 00:07:41.549]  They saw the exponential growth rate of Infowars.com two and a half years ago, and the fact that it was already the biggest multimedia news program in the world, and that it was exponentially growing, and so they said, okay, instead of ignoring Infowars, we've got to psychologically inoculate people with disinfo and lies about it, so that those spreading the word, word of mouth, will be scared to talk about Infowars.com.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:50.025]  Left someone, you know, tell them, oh, that's an evil site, or, oh, that site hurts the children.
[00:07:50.025 --> 00:07:53.587]  It's not the globalists who run Vatican raping children by the hundreds of thousands.
[00:07:53.587 --> 00:07:56.469]  It's not the UN kidnapping children by the tens of thousands.
[00:07:56.469 --> 00:08:04.916]  It's not all the Arab Spring funded by Obama and the Democrats killing hundreds of thousands and putting tens of thousands of children and women into sex slavery.
[00:08:04.916 --> 00:08:08.518]  No!
[00:08:08.518 --> 00:08:10.980]  No, ladies and gentlemen, that's not what it is.
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:11.621]  It's all
[00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:13.820]  Alex Jones.
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.021]  It's all info wars.
[00:08:15.021 --> 00:08:16.242]  He's the bad man.
[00:08:16.242 --> 00:08:19.284]  He's the one that's got to be stopped.
[00:08:19.284 --> 00:08:40.019]  Well, we told you, and Trump told you, that the Federal Reserve, the private Federal Reserve, kept raising interest rates, that it would trigger a downward spiral in the economy, and point out the private Federal Reserve, tied with other multinational banks, had called for China to continue to have basically unlimited free money and 0% interest rates, and that everything was rigged against the U.S.
[00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:41.680]  So Trump tried to fight that.
[00:08:42.557 --> 00:08:47.921]  And now they've had all these interest rate hikes and they've signaled more interest rate hikes.
[00:08:47.921 --> 00:08:49.182]  And that's driving down the economy.
[00:08:49.182 --> 00:08:58.608]  But bigger than that is Nancy Pelosi, about to be sworn in as the Speaker of the House, says she won't rule out indictment impeachment for Trump.
[00:08:58.608 --> 00:09:02.230]  And that's basically her saying she wants to indict him.
[00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:09.796]  Hank Johnson, the guy that says that islands float, has come out and called him Hitler and said that he should be thrown out of office.
[00:09:09.796 --> 00:09:11.497]  We have Sheila Jackson Lee and
[00:09:12.782 --> 00:09:16.503]  Alexander Cortez calling for reparations to be paid to black people.
[00:09:16.503 --> 00:09:18.563]  You've seen what government paychecks to black folks has done.
[00:09:18.563 --> 00:09:20.424]  It's ruined their communities.
[00:09:20.424 --> 00:09:23.824]  None of that money comes without serious strings.
[00:09:23.824 --> 00:09:29.025]  And this is just a country being torn apart at the seams.
[00:09:29.025 --> 00:09:36.427]  And a lot of people in the world had hoped that Trump could turn things around.
[00:09:36.427 --> 00:09:40.828]  They had hoped that we'd really be open for business.
[00:09:40.828 --> 00:09:40.988]  But
[00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.733]  A year and a half in, they saw things began to reverse.
[00:09:45.733 --> 00:09:48.255]  And so now, a growing U.S.
[00:09:48.255 --> 00:09:55.582]  economy, new jobs coming back, is not seen as something that is an absolute, not as a sure thing.
[00:09:55.582 --> 00:10:00.986]  And the establishment bets on one thing bigger than anything, and it's that you'll be lazy.
[00:10:00.986 --> 00:10:05.971]  And part of that laziness is mental laziness to not have a memory and just not care.
[00:10:07.059 --> 00:10:14.623]  And you run into people that haven't trained their memories, and you run into others that had a weak memory before, but as they get older, it just gets non-existent.
[00:10:14.623 --> 00:10:19.166]  They're living in this moment-to-moment, and not in a good way.
[00:10:19.166 --> 00:10:21.247]  They're not even really conscious.
[00:10:21.247 --> 00:10:33.393]  They don't remember that Trump just three months ago said, you want to be like Venezuela, you don't let us win the House and Senate, it'll signal they're going to win, and it's going to be really rocky, and that stock market's going to go down.
[00:10:33.393 --> 00:10:34.554]  That's a fact, but see,
[00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:39.180]  That was three months ago, two months ago.
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.821]  Hard to believe November in the election was just two months ago.
[00:10:42.821 --> 00:10:46.742]  Here it is, Bloomberg, the Trump slump.
[00:10:46.742 --> 00:10:49.543]  Now, if I put this image out, they'd call it fake news.
[00:10:49.543 --> 00:10:56.105]  But all it is is illustrative.
[00:10:56.105 --> 00:10:56.705]  That's all it is.
[00:10:58.831 --> 00:11:01.813]  It's just like him standing over the little girl he supposedly took from her mother.
[00:11:01.813 --> 00:11:03.334]  Wasn't a real photo, never happened.
[00:11:03.334 --> 00:11:14.703]  But it's all the image they need, the image of his red tie being red tape, or the country being in the red, and celebrating trying to drive the nation back under the waves of despair.
[00:11:14.703 --> 00:11:22.249]  And there is their illustration, their fake news, the Trump slump, why the market said goodbye to the Trump bump.
[00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:36.793]  And the real reason is the Democrats are making very demoralizing, war-like statements about how they're going to kill Trump, how they're going to indict Trump, how they're going to murder his family.
[00:11:36.793 --> 00:11:37.933]  Republicans are getting shot.
[00:11:37.933 --> 00:11:39.053]  They're getting their ribs broken.
[00:11:39.053 --> 00:11:41.274]  They're getting attacked.
[00:11:41.274 --> 00:11:43.234]  And nothing's being done.
[00:11:43.234 --> 00:11:45.455]  And so that's then taken by people in D.C.
[00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:48.916]  and New York and other areas that were thinking about fighting for the country.
[00:11:48.916 --> 00:11:51.457]  And they're thinking, man, this nation's full of a bunch of
[00:11:52.478 --> 00:12:07.147]  Traitors and a bunch of collaborators and a bunch of scum because people like Nancy Pelosi's daughter can get up on air and say things like, Trump is going to get his head cut off by my mother.
[00:12:07.147 --> 00:12:08.348]  Oh, but he'll never even know it.
[00:12:08.348 --> 00:12:09.028]  Well, of course not.
[00:12:09.028 --> 00:12:13.531]  If you blow somebody's head off or cut their head off, they usually don't know what hit them.
[00:12:13.531 --> 00:12:17.133]  And that's the whole statement to embolden their criminal forces.
[00:12:17.133 --> 00:12:19.395]  That's why they've said the deep state's going to kill this guy.
[00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:25.791]  That's why they said there's seven ways to Sunday to do all this.
[00:12:25.791 --> 00:12:32.293]  Because they've got to go around person by person and intimidate and threaten everyone in his administration.
[00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:36.394]  And most of them turn to the other side and say, fine.
[00:12:36.394 --> 00:12:38.775]  They're always being told Trump's going down.
[00:12:38.775 --> 00:12:39.475]  You're going down.
[00:12:39.475 --> 00:12:41.276]  A lot of them then hedge their bet.
[00:12:43.015 --> 00:12:45.636]  And they say, okay, I'll start giving you intel on Trump.
[00:12:45.636 --> 00:12:50.558]  And then as soon as they're traders giving intel, they go, hey, that's classified information you gave us.
[00:12:50.558 --> 00:12:56.520]  We'll sick Muller on you if you don't give us more.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.361]  And what really makes the deep state mad is that Trump has good instincts.
[00:12:59.361 --> 00:13:04.863]  Two trillion dollars that we've spent in the Middle East just in
[00:13:06.656 --> 00:13:08.417]  Afghanistan, that's Central Asia.
[00:13:08.417 --> 00:13:11.218]  It's like 5 trillion in the Middle East the last 30 years.
[00:13:11.218 --> 00:13:14.059]  That's more than all our education put together.
[00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:20.481]  Just in the sandbox of death and blood, we should put a wall around it and let them all kill each other.
[00:13:20.481 --> 00:13:24.803]  And Trump says all that is there is sand and death, and that's why they hate him.
[00:13:28.164 --> 00:13:31.525]  You used the word slowly when you were describing the withdrawal from Syria.
[00:13:31.525 --> 00:13:32.965]  I never said fast or slow.
[00:13:32.965 --> 00:13:34.225]  What's your timetable?
[00:13:34.225 --> 00:13:35.365]  When do you want troops to be out?
[00:13:35.365 --> 00:13:35.665]  I don't know.
[00:13:35.665 --> 00:13:39.306]  Somebody said four months, but I didn't say that either.
[00:13:39.306 --> 00:13:40.066]  I'm getting out.
[00:13:40.066 --> 00:13:41.166]  We're getting out of Syria.
[00:13:41.166 --> 00:13:43.987]  Look, we don't want Syria.
[00:13:43.987 --> 00:13:50.068]  Obama gave up Syria years ago when he didn't violate the red line.
[00:13:50.068 --> 00:13:54.969]  I did when I shot 59 missiles in, but that was a long time later.
[00:13:56.218 --> 00:14:02.875]  And when President Obama decided not to violate his statement that never crossed the red line and then
[00:14:04.153 --> 00:14:06.113]  They did it, he didn't do anything about it.
[00:14:06.113 --> 00:14:10.994]  You know, making a threat is okay, but you always have to follow through with a threat if you're gonna make that threat.
[00:14:10.994 --> 00:14:13.555]  You can't make a threat and then do nothing.
[00:14:13.555 --> 00:14:16.236]  So Syria was lost long ago.
[00:14:16.236 --> 00:14:18.436]  It was lost long ago.
[00:14:18.436 --> 00:14:22.017]  And besides that, we're talking about sand and death.
[00:14:22.017 --> 00:14:23.077]  That's what we're talking about.
[00:14:23.077 --> 00:14:25.678]  We're not talking about, you know, vast wealth.
[00:14:25.678 --> 00:14:27.318]  We're talking about sand and death.
[00:14:28.203 --> 00:14:34.668]  You're not talking about a war that generates freeing countries and empowering everybody and getting access to resources for everyone.
[00:14:34.668 --> 00:14:37.770]  You're talking about sand and death, Dick Cheney's war.
[00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:52.261]  And that's why both political parties say they hate him and it's why Alexandria Pelosi, the little queen of all the stolen money with contracts to her dad that mommy gave him, she's up there in her pink glasses saying that we're going to cut his head off and he'll never know it.
[00:14:55.629 --> 00:15:00.091]  She'll cut your head off and you won't even know you're bleeding.
[00:15:00.091 --> 00:15:01.952]  That's all you need to know about her.
[00:15:11.587 --> 00:15:14.470]  No one ever won betting against Nancy Pelosi.
[00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:15.371]  She's persevered.
[00:15:15.371 --> 00:15:16.572]  You've got to give her credit.
[00:15:16.572 --> 00:15:21.238]  No matter what you think of her, you have to give her credit because think about it.
[00:15:21.238 --> 00:15:23.900]  Think about all those presidents she's endured, right?
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.604]  She was the Bush, the Bush, the Clinton, you know, she's been through it all.
[00:15:27.604 --> 00:15:29.146]  So she's been around.
[00:15:29.146 --> 00:15:30.287]  This is not her first rodeo.
[00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:36.618]  And they're gearing up 84 fake investigations to bring down our president and kill market confidence.
[00:15:36.618 --> 00:15:38.639]  And then they tell you it's Trump's fault.
[00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:41.860]  When we come back, though, let's look at something really interesting.
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:45.842]  The Chinese just landed their probe on the dark side of the moon.
[00:15:45.842 --> 00:15:47.743]  We're told it's the first probe to ever land there.
[00:15:47.743 --> 00:15:54.345]  We'll tell you the rest of the story and show the amazing video and describe it for radio listeners on the other side.

[00:16:58.776 --> 00:17:05.139]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:05.139 --> 00:17:08.180]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:14.103]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:14.103 --> 00:17:17.884]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:17.884 --> 00:17:19.165]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:19.165 --> 00:17:20.045]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:20.485 --> 00:17:23.407]  The Deep State began with World War One.

[00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:10.319]  Believe me, I know.
[00:19:10.319 --> 00:19:15.025]  I spend hours in front of a screen, and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:19:15.025 --> 00:19:20.031]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.

[00:20:03.434 --> 00:20:06.036]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:46.477 --> 00:20:58.043]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the Communist Chinese in 2018 said they would land a probe on the dark side of the moon, and they did do it just yesterday in 2019, if you believe them.
[00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:13.891]  And that's a question.
[00:21:13.891 --> 00:21:20.036]  You know, the media says that I say we faked the moon landings.
[00:21:20.036 --> 00:21:25.319]  I said that there's a lot of secret government technology and a lot of it got covered up.
[00:21:25.319 --> 00:21:32.705]  They had backup plans and that a lot of people have died in the secret test pilot and secret space program.
[00:21:32.705 --> 00:21:33.445]  And that's a fact.
[00:21:37.867 --> 00:21:40.788]  mainstream media misrepresents what I've said about it.
[00:21:40.788 --> 00:21:42.028]  I know we can get to the moon.
[00:21:42.028 --> 00:21:44.388]  I know we can go to the Van Allen Radiation Belt.
[00:21:44.388 --> 00:21:53.050]  I know that I have personally been friends with multiple individuals that worked on the Apollo program and they told me it was 100% real.
[00:21:53.050 --> 00:22:00.012]  But there was a lot of times they had to go dark and a lot of other secret stuff that was going on that they were compartmentalized from and that was secret.
[00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:19.860]  Now obviously, when the Chinese craft goes onto the dark side, it's in a dead spot, like being in a cave, your cell phone doesn't work, so they're unable to transmit the images back, I guess until their rover gets data, gets back on the spacecraft, takes back off, and then can transmit back to Earth the images it's gotten.
[00:22:21.314 --> 00:22:27.579]  If we don't start seeing those images very, very soon from the mission, then we know that we're being handed a bill of goods.
[00:22:27.579 --> 00:22:35.426]  Here you're seeing film footage reportedly shot on the moon in the different Apollo missions, starting with Apollo 11.
[00:22:35.426 --> 00:22:41.291]  Now, you look at the film footage that was shot in the 1960s,
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:48.242]  Compared to what the Chinese put out, and our stuff looks just as good as what the Chinese has put out.
[00:22:48.242 --> 00:22:52.925]  So if we did fake it, we faked it better than they can do in 2019.
[00:22:52.925 --> 00:23:06.071]  Again, if you're a TV viewer, you can see some of the last images they were able to shoot right before their lunar lander landed and was unable to transmit over the horizon from right at the edge of the dark side of the moon.
[00:23:06.071 --> 00:23:09.513]  We can pull up some maps that I saw earlier of where they specifically landed.
[00:23:11.121 --> 00:23:14.583]  I know that jet airplanes are real and take off and fly around the world.
[00:23:14.583 --> 00:23:18.384]  I know that they had hot air balloons 600 years ago.
[00:23:18.384 --> 00:23:23.027]  I know they've dug up batteries in ancient Greece and ancient Rome.
[00:23:23.027 --> 00:23:25.468]  I know that we can do incredible things.
[00:23:25.468 --> 00:23:29.930]  I know this technology that we're using to broadcast right now is real.
[00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:31.811]  I know that we can create clones of humans.
[00:23:32.839 --> 00:23:35.281]  So yes, I know we have space technology.
[00:23:35.281 --> 00:23:37.683]  I believe that they're suppressing a lot of the technology.
[00:23:37.683 --> 00:23:40.245]  The evidence has showed that, and Trump has talked about that.
[00:23:40.245 --> 00:23:43.628]  So I believe the Chinese have gone to the moon.
[00:23:43.628 --> 00:23:54.557]  The biggest issue was, is that they did not have enough robotic control in the late 1960s, early 70s to send robots to the moon, period.
[00:23:54.557 --> 00:23:55.638]  And so they sent humans.
[00:23:55.638 --> 00:23:59.321]  And it's very, very risky, and it's very, very embarrassing when they die.
[00:24:00.265 --> 00:24:25.101]  And that's the rest of the story, is that I've been told by folks, without getting into secret stuff, which they wouldn't tell me, that they could only give me examples in pop culture of what was really going on, and that there was a large, and still is a large, secret space program, about 90% of the space program is secret, and there have been many, many moon missions, and there have been many missions to the dark side of the moon.
[00:24:25.101 --> 00:24:28.724]  I was told by Buzz Aldrin on this show, probably 10 years ago,
[00:24:29.616 --> 00:24:51.751]  We've got to find that interview and re-air it, that we should send our next probe to the lone moon of Mars, because the lone moon of Mars has a perfect obelisk on it transmitting a radio frequency, that they'd known about that frequency and had telescopes that were looking at it since the days of the book being written in 2001, Space
[00:24:54.429 --> 00:24:54.830]  Odyssey.
[00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:55.810]  In fact, there's the interview.
[00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:57.953]  It was erased off the Alex Jones Channel.
[00:24:57.953 --> 00:25:00.115]  Deleted, but somebody else has it.
[00:25:00.115 --> 00:25:02.977]  And that's Encyclopedia Britannica.
[00:25:02.977 --> 00:25:06.781]  Or I guess now they feed other people's info over everything I say.
[00:25:06.781 --> 00:25:08.903]  And that's the astronaut himself.
[00:25:08.903 --> 00:25:09.784]  Can't listen to him.
[00:25:09.784 --> 00:25:11.286]  Second guy to walk on the moon.
[00:25:11.286 --> 00:25:12.587]  Gotta listen to Encyclopedia Britannica.
[00:25:12.587 --> 00:25:13.348]  But go ahead and expand that.
[00:25:13.348 --> 00:25:16.150]  I don't want to tell people the site that is.
[00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:17.652]  That is Floyd Anderson.
[00:25:19.892 --> 00:25:24.294]  So that's Floyd Anderson has that interview saved, so you can go hear it for yourself from 2009.
[00:25:24.294 --> 00:25:28.917]  See, I said about 10 years ago, and I'm right, 10 years ago.
[00:25:28.917 --> 00:25:32.359]  My memory serves, but oh, that's the new thing.
[00:25:32.359 --> 00:25:46.307]  All news on YouTube now, Google parent company, Alphabet parent company of that, force feeds you CNN videos, the top 30 on top, and force feeds overlays to cnn.com of the president speaking.
[00:25:47.369 --> 00:25:50.272]  When he speaks now, they put CNN over him.
[00:25:50.272 --> 00:25:53.415]  There's an article on Infowars.com about it.
[00:25:53.415 --> 00:25:59.241]  The article says YouTube begins inserting CNN articles over all political videos.
[00:25:59.241 --> 00:26:00.061]  It's worse than that.
[00:26:00.061 --> 00:26:01.683]  I went and looked this morning.
[00:26:01.683 --> 00:26:04.846]  I went and looked at Trump's latest speech, his cabinet meeting.
[00:26:04.846 --> 00:26:08.450]  It's all force-fed CNN fact-checking him.
[00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:09.651]  A pack of criminal liars.
[00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.490]  They're breaking in over the president.
[00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:15.331]  See, first it's, we're just going to break in over the KKK.
[00:26:15.331 --> 00:26:16.971]  And then we're going to break in over Alex Jones.
[00:26:16.971 --> 00:26:21.332]  And then we're going to break in over Franklin Graham.
[00:26:21.332 --> 00:26:24.893]  And then we're going to just ban everybody.
[00:26:24.893 --> 00:26:25.733]  It's here.
[00:26:25.733 --> 00:26:27.414]  Congress must act.
[00:26:27.414 --> 00:26:28.634]  This is outrageous.
[00:26:28.634 --> 00:26:32.575]  Sorry, I got sidestepped or sidetracked by that.
[00:26:32.575 --> 00:26:40.677]  The rest of the story is, I was talking to Buzz Aldrin out in LA once, and I'm not going to get into the details of the
[00:26:41.981 --> 00:26:44.244]  I met with him once in L.A.
[00:26:44.244 --> 00:26:47.046]  and then talked to him on the phone a few times out in L.A.
[00:26:47.046 --> 00:26:50.790]  and he said, Alex, we've got a lot of secret stuff.
[00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:52.312]  And they get really mad when I tell you about this.
[00:26:52.312 --> 00:26:54.974]  We've got a lot of fans at NASA that want you to get things straight.
[00:26:54.974 --> 00:27:01.841]  He said, the Chinese the next year are going to say they're going to do this and that because the Indians are working with them.
[00:27:01.841 --> 00:27:02.322]  They're good guys.
[00:27:02.722 --> 00:27:05.283]  They're gonna crash a probe in and discover pure water.
[00:27:05.283 --> 00:27:09.225]  They're gonna crash the probe, eject it up, so they can be the discoverers of it.
[00:27:09.225 --> 00:27:12.626]  Let me just say, we know all about the water up there.
[00:27:12.626 --> 00:27:13.246]  My boy.
[00:27:13.246 --> 00:27:16.148]  And we've been all over the moon.
[00:27:16.148 --> 00:27:17.708]  And I'm just like, okay!
[00:27:17.708 --> 00:27:20.710]  And I did kick that young man's ass that said I was a liar!
[00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:24.471]  There's a famous footage of him knocking people out to get in his face.
[00:27:24.471 --> 00:27:25.572]  And so, that's Buzz Aldrin!
[00:27:26.434 --> 00:27:27.215]  That's what he told me.
[00:27:27.215 --> 00:27:33.162]  And then about eight, nine, ten months later, I'm walking through an airport and I look at the cover of the magazine.
[00:27:33.162 --> 00:27:39.189]  It says, Indians crash probe, discover water and even where they discovered it at the pole.
[00:27:39.189 --> 00:27:40.630]  And I remember Buzz Aldrin going.
[00:27:44.952 --> 00:27:47.214]  Yeah, we like to dole it out slow to them, son.
[00:27:47.214 --> 00:27:48.635]  They can't really handle it.
[00:27:48.635 --> 00:27:53.259]  Let's just say, if we get the right type of president, there'll be some big announcements.
[00:27:53.259 --> 00:28:02.206]  You know, NASA helped innovate all the technologies of the world, and if we were just able to release some of the new technologies they've got, my boy, well, let's just say our problems would be solved.
[00:28:02.206 --> 00:28:04.968]  But there are certain people that don't want
[00:28:05.689 --> 00:28:07.731]  The public to have all that.
[00:28:07.731 --> 00:28:09.773]  And I just think they deserve it.
[00:28:09.773 --> 00:28:11.274]  After all, you did pay for it.
[00:28:11.274 --> 00:28:12.916]  I did pay for it, son.
[00:28:12.916 --> 00:28:18.341]  But you can bet your bottom dollar we've been to the moon and a little bit further than that.
[00:28:18.341 --> 00:28:20.743]  That's Buzz Aldrin.
[00:28:20.743 --> 00:28:23.966]  And I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:28:23.966 --> 00:28:26.008]  And then he got threatened not to talk to me anymore.
[00:28:26.008 --> 00:28:26.909]  And he won't talk to me anymore.
[00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:27.450]  And that's fine.
[00:28:28.727 --> 00:28:38.275]  Oh, I guess if this video was allowed on YouTube by the censors that have Encyclopedia Britannica over it, maybe saying I'm a moon landing hoaxer, which I'm not, see?
[00:28:38.275 --> 00:28:41.857]  But that's what you go to Britannica to learn, I guess, these days.
[00:28:41.857 --> 00:28:47.222]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back on the other side, but to be clear...
[00:28:48.539 --> 00:28:55.162]  I don't think there's any human slaves on Mars, and I do believe the Chinese just landed on the dark side of the moon, so congratulations to them!
[00:28:55.162 --> 00:28:57.022]  Congratulations, commies!
[00:28:57.022 --> 00:28:59.243]  Took you 30 years longer than us.
[00:28:59.243 --> 00:29:05.586]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:29:05.586 --> 00:29:08.647]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:29:08.647 --> 00:29:14.189]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:18.353]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:29:18.353 --> 00:29:19.614]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:29:19.614 --> 00:29:20.615]  Who do we fight for?

[00:33:18.298 --> 00:33:22.680]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:25.302]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:25.302 --> 00:33:31.305]  All along the lonesome highway, east of Omaha.
[00:33:31.305 --> 00:33:38.149]  You listen to the engine, the morning out is one old song.
[00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:44.573]  You think about the woman, the girl you knew the night before.
[00:33:59.725 --> 00:34:18.798]  Mr. Rhodes, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Sass, Mr. Schatz, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Scott, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Shelby, Ms.
[00:34:18.798 --> 00:34:19.259]  Cinema,
[00:34:20.188 --> 00:34:22.130]  Mr. Smith, Ms.
[00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:28.335]  Stabenow, Mr. Sullivan.
[00:34:28.335 --> 00:34:38.262]  That is the horrifying sound from our satellite feed directly in the House chambers of Nancy the Swamp Creature Pelosi.
[00:34:38.262 --> 00:34:41.105]  We can't, let's go back to that audio, just keep it ambient in the background.
[00:34:41.105 --> 00:34:42.045]  Mr. Van Hollen.
[00:34:42.045 --> 00:34:45.048]  Of Nancy the Swamp Creature Pelosi.
[00:34:45.048 --> 00:34:45.408]  Ms.
[00:34:45.408 --> 00:34:46.049]  Warren.
[00:34:46.049 --> 00:34:48.551]  About to be sworn in after they do this roll call.
[00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:55.919]  In front of Congress as the new Speaker of the House.
[00:34:55.919 --> 00:35:14.351]  And then you can get ready for the 84 and more that are starting out with 84 new investigations that they plan to launch against President Trump and the American recovery and our attempt to take our nation back from the globalists.
[00:35:14.351 --> 00:35:17.793]  And we've seen draconian un-American censorship.
[00:35:17.793 --> 00:35:20.175]  We've seen big tech openly moving to China.
[00:35:20.936 --> 00:35:31.082]  We've seen the total sellout of our civilization.
[00:35:31.082 --> 00:35:44.490]  Now, if we cannot get the narrative out to the public that we're fighting just to get control of our country from the globalists, we'll lose the fight with the globalists.
[00:35:45.888 --> 00:35:56.779]  I know it's not fun to admit we've been taken over, but they're even to the point of sexualizing our children and doing things that adults would be called perverts as parents.
[00:35:56.779 --> 00:36:09.311]  If you were trying to tell your child at age five they were another gender, if you were reading them books about men having sex together or men and women having sex together, you would be called a weird pervert sexualizer of your child.
[00:36:15.239 --> 00:36:37.096]  But now, they have Desmond the Amazing, who's all over national TV the last four or five years, he's now 11, who goes to gay strip clubs to dance on stage and have men throw a child money while he's dressed like a girl shaking his butt.
[00:36:37.096 --> 00:36:42.641]  And the news praises it, and then not in one, not in two, but in postings all over now, we're finding,
[00:36:44.574 --> 00:36:49.935]  Why is Desmond so amazing he looks drugged out of his mind?
[00:36:49.935 --> 00:36:51.096]  Let's show some of the other photos.
[00:36:51.096 --> 00:36:57.877]  Just type in The Amazing Desmond, or Desmond Amazing, and click Google Images, or show the videos we were showing the other day.
[00:36:57.877 --> 00:37:01.058]  He's talking about snorting ketamine.
[00:37:01.058 --> 00:37:10.300]  There's posters behind him talking about date rape, rohibonol, amnesic drugs used in orgies.
[00:37:12.819 --> 00:37:19.181]  And this is what we put up with, this poor little abused child, in my view, up there.
[00:37:19.181 --> 00:37:23.382]  We showed some of the videos the other day of the transformation.
[00:37:23.382 --> 00:37:25.683]  That's him a couple years ago.
[00:37:25.683 --> 00:37:27.803]  Let's show the particular new videos.
[00:37:27.803 --> 00:37:31.024]  Yeah, that's some of the new stuff up there in the left-hand corner.
[00:37:31.024 --> 00:37:34.145]  Some of the videos that you showed the other day.
[00:37:34.145 --> 00:37:39.067]  One is with him with two adult gay men with the word Rohiminal behind him, rubies, roofies.
[00:37:40.305 --> 00:37:44.868]  And then there's the other video of him talking about LGBT.
[00:37:44.868 --> 00:37:45.829]  And then there, I mean, look at him.
[00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:48.831]  He looks like he can barely open his eyes there.
[00:37:48.831 --> 00:37:52.894]  Look how bombed out of his poor little brain.
[00:37:52.894 --> 00:38:00.700]  And there's a poster about Rohib and all with a little boy jumping rope, dressed like a girl.
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:06.424]  So here they are sitting on a couch, two adult men with an 11 year old boy who looks like he's drugged out of his mind.
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:21.027]  And there is images of children skipping rope, and it says Rufi under it, or Rohibnol.
[00:38:21.027 --> 00:38:26.050]  And then there's open paintings that this artist sells about Rohibnol.
[00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:28.652]  Let's go to, we'll get back to this in a moment, let's go to the
[00:38:29.784 --> 00:38:33.767]  Vice President Mike Pence set to swear in Nancy Pelosi.
[00:38:33.767 --> 00:38:35.188]  This is the dark days we're facing.
[00:38:35.188 --> 00:38:35.528]  Here it is.
[00:38:35.528 --> 00:38:49.337]  In the previous order, the leadership time is reserved and the Senate will be in a period of morning business with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
[00:38:49.337 --> 00:38:50.438]  Mr. President.
[00:38:50.438 --> 00:38:51.178]  Majority Leader.
[00:38:51.178 --> 00:38:54.480]  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S.R.E.S.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.442]  1, submitted earlier today.
[00:38:57.442 --> 00:38:58.663]  Clerk will report the resolution.
[00:38:59.079 --> 00:39:05.641]  Senate Resolution 1, informing the President of the United States that a quorum of each House is assembled.
[00:39:05.641 --> 00:39:08.342]  Is there objection to proceeding to the measure?
[00:39:08.342 --> 00:39:10.543]  Without objection, the Senate will proceed to the measure.
[00:39:10.543 --> 00:39:20.107]  I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.
[00:39:20.107 --> 00:39:20.807]  Without objection.
[00:39:22.346 --> 00:39:23.227]  Okay, let's go back to where we were.
[00:39:23.227 --> 00:39:24.168]  You've got the amazing
[00:39:41.013 --> 00:40:04.811]  Desmond, whom I see all over the news, just how wonderful it is, and he's the example, and your kids should do it too, and he goes to schools and talks to kids about how you can change your sex, you can go dance at gay clubs, and they have the adult, quote, drag queens there to teach the kids at career day, this is a great decision for you as young as age five, and this is what's going on.
[00:40:04.811 --> 00:40:09.294]  Children looking drugged out of their minds with paintings behind them celebrating Rohibitol.
[00:40:11.533 --> 00:40:17.277]  And everybody in this photo, if you're watching or the video, looks like they've been taking something like Rohibanol.
[00:40:17.277 --> 00:40:19.639]  The date rape drug, the amnesiac.
[00:40:19.639 --> 00:40:24.282]  Now, let's continue.
[00:40:24.282 --> 00:40:31.728]  You then again have him in videos talking about how LGBT, everybody's in the club.
[00:40:31.728 --> 00:40:39.313]  And then talking about snorting ketamine off of his wrist and getting high.
[00:40:39.313 --> 00:40:40.314]  And the poor little thing
[00:40:41.747 --> 00:40:45.111]  Looks like he's about to die.
[00:40:45.111 --> 00:40:47.053]  He's being sacrificed by the evil system.
[00:40:47.053 --> 00:40:51.819]  And I predict he'll be dead on the current course by the time he's 16.
[00:40:51.819 --> 00:40:55.904]  And they'll say, poor little amazing Desmond.
[00:40:55.904 --> 00:40:57.706]  Everyone was so mean to him.
[00:40:57.706 --> 00:41:01.210]  Everybody was so bad to him for so long.
[00:41:02.895 --> 00:41:06.318]  Because of his trans nature, he committed suicide.
[00:41:06.318 --> 00:41:08.079]  It'll be a drug overdose.
[00:41:08.079 --> 00:41:21.969]  You know, the group that dies the youngest of suicide, of drug overdose, of being actually abused, not by the heterosexual community, but by whatever you call this community, are the trans community.
[00:41:21.969 --> 00:41:32.277]  And they get kids and they convince them to have their testicles removed, or to be chemically castrated, and then to go into a lifestyle that, man, I was in some regular topless bars, some in college, and didn't like them.
[00:41:33.922 --> 00:41:38.386]  And got drugged to him a few times, you know, after I'd be at some comedy club or something.
[00:41:38.386 --> 00:41:39.468]  Oh, let's go to this restaurant.
[00:41:39.468 --> 00:41:43.051]  And, you know, you're in another city and you walk in and it's a topless bar.
[00:41:43.051 --> 00:41:47.195]  And I just couldn't wait to get out of them.
[00:41:47.195 --> 00:41:51.199]  Because there's just this, it just, it just feels plastic.
[00:41:51.199 --> 00:41:52.721]  And I'm not judging everybody that goes to them.
[00:41:54.414 --> 00:42:08.144]  But man, can you imagine walking into one of these and there's an 11-year-old little boy up there dressed like a girl shaking his butt and he looks bombed out of his brain and then that's on TV as a good thing and then it's all over the country it's being done?
[00:42:08.144 --> 00:42:16.670]  You see, if the globalists can't abort our children, if the globalists can't get that done, they are going to try to
[00:42:18.325 --> 00:42:23.533]  Destroy them outside the womb and destroy the reproductivity because men are who can fight tyranny.
[00:42:23.533 --> 00:42:30.884]  And the powerful alpha males in control, just like a lion, will kill the dominant male cub.
[00:42:33.877 --> 00:42:37.359]  Because they want to get rid of the competition.
[00:42:37.359 --> 00:42:38.059]  It's the same thing.
[00:42:38.059 --> 00:42:41.121]  That's what this whole situation is.
[00:42:41.121 --> 00:42:51.708]  Celebrating the drugging and having sex with children in your face and the government-run schools now a conduit to strike your children dead with this lightning.
[00:42:51.708 --> 00:42:56.911]  We'll be right back with the open celebration of abortion in the schools in children's TV shows.

[00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:27.693]  I am patient zero in the massive banning.

[00:46:34.959 --> 00:46:38.922]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.

[00:46:44.887 --> 00:46:49.411]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public, hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:46:49.411 --> 00:46:52.454]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment!
[00:46:55.609 --> 00:47:02.860]  And the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit!
[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:05.504]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:26.664 --> 00:47:39.352]  When you think about how evil the Democratic Party is, and how they represent the globalist, and how we're so close to taking the Republican Party away from the globalist bluebloods, it makes my heart skip a beat, really.
[00:47:39.352 --> 00:47:54.961]  Nancy Pelosi is being worshipped right now, live on C-SPAN, as they're preparing to have the vote, to then move towards her being sworn in, and to watch the fawning and groveling during the break, and to know how truly corrupt and evil
[00:47:56.702 --> 00:48:01.344]  These Democrat big city regimes are makes my head spin.
[00:48:01.344 --> 00:48:06.705]  But the good news is people are voting with their feet.
[00:48:06.705 --> 00:48:10.006]  And the biggest exodus in the country is out of beautiful Vermont.
[00:48:10.006 --> 00:48:14.948]  It was once totally conservative like Texas 50 years ago.
[00:48:14.948 --> 00:48:21.810]  And now Vermont is worse than San Francisco, but they're having record exodus out
[00:48:24.841 --> 00:48:29.724]  Because almost everyone is sick of living under the oppression.
[00:48:29.724 --> 00:48:34.727]  And of course, New York is trying to say Trump's the reason people are leaving New York.
[00:48:34.727 --> 00:48:41.951]  No, they're leaving because of you, Cuomo, who said, if you're a Christian, or you're anti-abortion, or you're a gun owner, you're not welcome.
[00:48:41.951 --> 00:48:47.435]  He said, if you're a Christian conservative, you're not welcome in New York.
[00:48:47.435 --> 00:48:48.956]  And you're like, that's a crazy statement.
[00:48:48.956 --> 00:48:50.437]  No, that's who he is.
[00:48:50.437 --> 00:48:52.538]  Just like he said, America was never that great.
[00:48:54.232 --> 00:48:56.132]  And it'll never be great.
[00:48:56.132 --> 00:48:57.713]  Close quote.
[00:48:57.713 --> 00:49:08.195]  America was never that great, and it'll never be great, until the socialism.
[00:49:08.195 --> 00:49:10.715]  That's the quote.
[00:49:10.715 --> 00:49:12.896]  That's the quote.
[00:49:12.896 --> 00:49:17.737]  You have to understand, these are the people hired by globalists to bring the country down.
[00:49:19.434 --> 00:49:20.594]  This is who they are.
[00:49:20.594 --> 00:49:21.835]  This is what they do.
[00:49:21.835 --> 00:49:25.655]  They told Trump he's bad to say we even have a nation.
[00:49:25.655 --> 00:49:26.516]  Every channel.
[00:49:26.516 --> 00:49:27.476]  Remember Don Lemon?
[00:49:27.476 --> 00:49:30.056]  I have to apologize to the viewers for having to hear that.
[00:49:30.056 --> 00:49:35.417]  He just said nationalist and nation state.
[00:49:35.417 --> 00:49:44.820]  In fact, yeah, let's hear Cuomo and then let's go to this live feed in the House of Representatives where the enemy, by massive fraud, was able to get control of the House and now has 84.
[00:49:47.432 --> 00:49:58.002]  Investigations, none of them to do with Russia, of the president and his family, the golf courses, everything, going back 50 years to Fred Trump.
[00:49:58.002 --> 00:50:06.350]  And then he set up tax systems with trust funds for his kids.
[00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:08.992]  That's what everybody does.
[00:50:08.992 --> 00:50:11.495]  People make $100,000 a year set up trust for their kids.
[00:50:15.305 --> 00:50:18.986]  And you sure better set it all up by the time you die.
[00:50:18.986 --> 00:50:24.607]  You better have given it all away to somebody or they're going to hit you with that death tax.
[00:50:24.607 --> 00:50:26.107]  Which again, the globalists all avoid.
[00:50:26.107 --> 00:50:29.568]  The ones always calling for higher taxes pay almost no taxes.
[00:50:29.568 --> 00:50:39.130]  They all go to Congress with no money and they become billionaires like Nancy Pelosi and her crime dynasty and her disgusting family.
[00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:41.050]  And I say that because they're always on my butt.
[00:50:41.946 --> 00:50:43.388]  She is a thug.
[00:50:43.388 --> 00:50:45.631]  She'll kill the First Amendment just as sure as the sun came up.
[00:50:45.631 --> 00:50:46.932]  Hell, they've already done a pretty good job.
[00:50:46.932 --> 00:50:48.975]  Here, let's hear some of this babble.
[00:50:54.683 --> 00:50:58.806]  He knows government is not the source of our liberty.
[00:50:58.806 --> 00:51:04.230]  Rather, it is instituted among men and women to secure our liberty.
[00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:15.558]  Leader McCarthy has led us through the 115th Congress in unmatched historic productivity, including passage of the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, because we know
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:26.582]  We know, Madam Clerk, that the American people know better than the government how to spend their money.
[00:51:26.582 --> 00:51:29.343]  And that's the Republican speaking.
[00:51:29.343 --> 00:51:35.325]  When you hear the Democrats speak, it's literally like hearing a lobotomized weasel.
[00:51:35.325 --> 00:51:38.026]  Let's go back to what I was hitting on.
[00:51:38.026 --> 00:51:46.508]  Because we've got Nancy Pelosi greenlighting that they won't rule out trying to indict Trump or impeach Trump, as if they even have the power to indict.
[00:51:46.508 --> 00:51:48.109]  But that's her using the term of the House
[00:51:49.716 --> 00:51:54.337]  Moving for impeachment is the indictment, then the Senate would have the trial.
[00:51:54.337 --> 00:52:01.238]  Which is so critical that Trump had a large majority in the Senate, which they did get a better majority, but not a large majority.
[00:52:01.238 --> 00:52:08.560]  So that's why this whole thing is hit and miss, especially with Ruth Bader Ginsburg preparing to make the jump into hyperspace.
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:16.201]  Remember Pelosi's daughter warns Trump, my mommy will cut your head off and you won't even know you're bleeding, kind of like you've done to America.
[00:52:17.759 --> 00:52:20.341]  Or how about all those little kids that get their heads cut off?
[00:52:20.341 --> 00:52:22.442]  Hashtag shoutyouranabortionfounder.
[00:52:22.442 --> 00:52:24.323]  How about we hashtag Alex Jones?
[00:52:24.323 --> 00:52:25.464]  They hate that on Twitter.
[00:52:25.464 --> 00:52:29.006]  They can ban me, but they can't ban hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:52:29.006 --> 00:52:35.050]  Hashtag shoutyouranabortionfounder indoctrinates kids in cringeworthy propaganda video.
[00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:42.395]  Yeah, you've seen the videos where Gloria Steinem says how great it is to get an abortion, and how fun it is, and then women getting abortions, talking about how good it feels.
[00:52:43.382 --> 00:52:44.542]  Now, how it's empowering.
[00:52:44.542 --> 00:52:48.163]  I'll spare you playing those videos again, but this is a new one.
[00:52:48.163 --> 00:52:50.764]  In a tweet advertising her upcoming children's book on abortion.
[00:52:50.764 --> 00:52:53.285]  How about children's books on abortion?
[00:52:53.285 --> 00:53:00.827]  Not a children's book about butterflies or fishing or grandma and grandpa or about the big bad wolf predators like this lady.
[00:53:00.827 --> 00:53:01.307]  No, no.
[00:53:01.307 --> 00:53:03.767]  It's a story about how wonderful it is.
[00:53:03.767 --> 00:53:06.028]  In a tweet advertising her upcoming children's book on abortion.
[00:53:07.742 --> 00:53:15.426]  Bo now shared the propaganda video saying, I'll let a bunch of kids grill me about my abortion, and it was great!
[00:53:15.426 --> 00:53:16.907]  Here, let's play some of the video.
[00:53:16.907 --> 00:53:19.949]  This is what's force fed, directed at children on YouTube.
[00:53:19.949 --> 00:53:20.249]  Here it is.
[00:53:20.936 --> 00:53:24.337]  When you have an abortion, what exactly do you do to, like, have the abortion?
[00:53:24.337 --> 00:53:37.383]  You go to the doctor, and they put this little straw inside of your cervix, and then inside of your uterus, and then they just suck the pregnancy out.
[00:53:37.383 --> 00:53:40.104]  And it was like a crappy dentist appointment or something.
[00:53:40.104 --> 00:53:48.068]  It was just like, ah, this is like a body thing that's kind of uncomfortable, but then it was over, and I felt really just...
[00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:51.309]  I'm grateful that I wasn't pregnant anymore.
[00:53:51.309 --> 00:53:56.090]  I've gotten into many an internet argument about it.
[00:53:56.090 --> 00:54:00.091]  Facebook, Instagram, just all the social medias.
[00:54:00.091 --> 00:54:03.132]  It's so taboo to a lot of folks and I don't know why.
[00:54:03.132 --> 00:54:06.692]  Do you think that sometimes it's not okay to have an abortion?
[00:54:06.692 --> 00:54:11.433]  I want to say if like if you're being reckless, if there's nothing wrong going on.
[00:54:11.433 --> 00:54:12.774]  I don't know.
[00:54:12.774 --> 00:54:14.034]  I just don't agree.
[00:54:15.912 --> 00:54:19.096]  Do we want people to just have all those babies?
[00:54:19.096 --> 00:54:20.417]  No.
[00:54:20.417 --> 00:54:21.858]  So what do we do with them?
[00:54:21.858 --> 00:54:24.581]  Put them up for adoption.
[00:54:24.581 --> 00:54:28.245]  She's here talking to the black kid, the main target of abortion is blacks.
[00:54:28.245 --> 00:54:29.686]  He's like, man, I don't think we ought to be doing this.
[00:54:29.686 --> 00:54:33.250]  She's like, oh yeah, we're going to be doing it.
[00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:34.111]  Boy, the message.
[00:54:35.606 --> 00:54:39.611]  You gotta understand, the average white person who's a liberal are the racist.
[00:54:39.611 --> 00:54:43.236]  I know them, I run into them, they are monstrous people.
[00:54:43.236 --> 00:54:47.681]  So here's this spider creeping over the black kid, trying to normalize abortion to him.
[00:54:47.681 --> 00:54:47.962]  Here it is.
[00:54:48.869 --> 00:54:53.232]  I am forced to create life.
[00:54:53.232 --> 00:54:55.433]  I have lost the right to my own life.
[00:54:55.433 --> 00:54:59.915]  I should be the one to decide if my body creates a life.
[00:54:59.915 --> 00:55:05.198]  Even if you're giving a kid up for adoption, you still, like, have a kid out there somewhere, you know?
[00:55:05.198 --> 00:55:07.480]  Are you religious at all?
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:09.421]  I believe in God.
[00:55:09.421 --> 00:55:11.442]  What do you think that God thinks about abortion?
[00:55:11.442 --> 00:55:12.222]  All right, let's stop right here.
[00:55:12.222 --> 00:55:13.323]  I can't watch any more of this.
[00:55:15.229 --> 00:55:21.475]  What is YouTube doing kicking all the Christians and conservatives and you know Franklin Graham being kicked off Facebook?
[00:55:21.475 --> 00:55:29.002]  But then they've got all these new shows we played where they teach little Asian kids that whites are inherently bad and that communism is good.
[00:55:29.872 --> 00:55:33.333]  And then it's some rich, you know, Hollywood person producing it.
[00:55:33.333 --> 00:55:37.694]  It's all total division, and these people are obsessed with your children.
[00:55:37.694 --> 00:55:51.936]  Just like earlier, I covered the video of the amazing Desmond, obviously bombed out of his brain on drugs, talking about ketamine and roofies, with grown men and transvestites all over him.
[00:55:51.936 --> 00:55:52.997]  Poor little thing!
[00:55:52.997 --> 00:55:54.677]  Where are the police investigations?
[00:55:57.551 --> 00:55:58.712]  Because he's a little boy.
[00:55:58.712 --> 00:55:59.974]  So it's like, toughen up!
[00:55:59.974 --> 00:56:04.298]  We're going to give you hormones to sterilize you and some ketamine.
[00:56:04.298 --> 00:56:04.839]  Toughen up!
[00:56:04.839 --> 00:56:06.421]  Get up there on stage and dance.
[00:56:06.421 --> 00:56:11.826]  But if this was a little girl, which I agree we should do something, the SWAT team would have been there that night.
[00:56:11.826 --> 00:56:18.674]  Can you imagine at a gay or straight strip club having an 11-year-old that they advertised for weeks and sold $15 tickets?
[00:56:20.698 --> 00:56:30.464]  Now, in the articles we wrote about this, there were a lot of the, quote, gay men who went on Facebook and said, I saw this a week ago, I'm still shaken up by it.
[00:56:30.464 --> 00:56:32.385]  There's no place for children.
[00:56:32.385 --> 00:56:37.128]  Yeah, not in a straight bar, that's a dance bar, not in a gay bar, anywhere.
[00:56:37.128 --> 00:56:39.009]  We all know this.
[00:56:39.009 --> 00:56:44.152]  But you look at the artwork of who the amazing Desmond is hanging out with.
[00:56:44.152 --> 00:56:47.674]  Zombie girl jumping rope.
[00:56:47.674 --> 00:56:48.915]  Zombie girl with
[00:56:50.069 --> 00:56:51.270]  Some type of drugs.
[00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:53.011]  Toucan Sam with pills.
[00:56:53.011 --> 00:56:54.532]  Rohibanol.
[00:56:54.532 --> 00:56:56.233]  Demon Baby.
[00:56:56.233 --> 00:57:01.136]  And then the child is hanging around in videos with the Demon Baby pictures behind him.
[00:57:01.136 --> 00:57:04.739]  It's all about, we are going to corrupt your children.
[00:57:04.739 --> 00:57:06.180]  Corrupt the child.
[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:12.384]  Destroy them all.
[00:57:12.384 --> 00:57:19.709]  Now as you've noticed, I've gotten so busy this hour that I haven't even plugged products or services that our advertisers have at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:24.574]  And if I don't do that, we won't be here, but you've really come through and supported us.
[00:57:24.574 --> 00:57:32.682]  So it's not a gimmick when I keep saying, like yesterday, today's the last day of the four-wide free shipping, free gift, 75% off, blah, blah, blah.
[00:57:32.682 --> 00:57:35.664]  I've been so busy, I haven't cut new ads.
[00:57:35.664 --> 00:57:42.551]  So this must absolutely be the last day at InfoWarsTore.com, but then it will end, because we're selling out of everything.
[00:57:42.551 --> 00:57:44.292]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:57:44.292 --> 00:57:46.574]  Get the very best supplements at the best prices and more.
[00:57:49.392 --> 00:57:54.657]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[00:57:54.657 --> 00:58:02.746]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[00:58:02.746 --> 00:58:04.627]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[00:58:05.339 --> 00:58:08.781]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[00:58:08.781 --> 00:58:11.402]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[00:58:11.402 --> 00:58:13.683]  So we've already had incredible success.
[00:58:13.683 --> 00:58:26.109]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com,
[00:58:27.273 --> 00:58:30.976]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[00:58:30.976 --> 00:58:32.158]  We'll win.
[00:58:32.158 --> 00:58:35.060]  We have huge sales at InfoWars4.com right now.
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:40.385]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce.
[00:58:40.385 --> 00:58:42.227]  And you're right, to the market.
[00:58:42.227 --> 00:58:45.910]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:47.151]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[00:58:47.151 --> 00:58:48.332]  We need your support.
[00:58:48.332 --> 00:58:48.893]  I'm counting on you.
[00:58:50.515 --> 00:58:54.758]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[00:58:54.758 --> 00:58:58.240]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.001]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[00:59:00.001 --> 00:59:03.263]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[00:59:03.263 --> 00:59:10.047]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I'd be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[00:59:10.047 --> 00:59:15.130]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:21.596]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[00:59:21.596 --> 00:59:24.558]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[00:59:24.558 --> 00:59:25.659]  I want to keep going.
[00:59:25.659 --> 00:59:29.483]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[00:59:29.483 --> 00:59:31.505]  I want to push all the way.
[00:59:31.505 --> 00:59:32.806]  I've committed to do that.
[00:59:32.806 --> 00:59:33.887]  I've prayed for that.
[00:59:33.887 --> 00:59:35.529]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[00:59:35.529 --> 00:59:37.971]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[00:59:38.451 --> 00:59:39.571]  I will never falter.
[00:59:39.571 --> 00:59:42.092]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[00:59:42.092 --> 00:59:43.033]  I physically will.
[00:59:43.033 --> 00:59:53.857]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, then 4Wars4.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[00:59:53.857 --> 01:00:01.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.521]  You lock the door.
[01:00:04.521 --> 01:00:06.922]  Throw away the key.
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:26.904]  That's right, folks.
[01:00:26.904 --> 01:00:31.485]  The dark side of the moon.
[01:00:31.485 --> 01:00:33.205]  The Chi-Coms have landed a probe there.
[01:00:33.205 --> 01:00:36.546]  I believe they've gone there.
[01:00:37.805 --> 01:00:43.230]  You believe I can jump on an airplane in 16 hours and be in Tokyo, Japan, too?
[01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:51.577]  I can also go to the store and buy a rifle that at a thousand yards I can shoot antelope with without even looking at the sight.
[01:00:51.577 --> 01:00:57.363]  Yes, you can shoot cruise missiles down your chimney in 1970.
[01:00:57.363 --> 01:01:00.425]  And we can land on the dark side of the moon.
[01:01:00.425 --> 01:01:02.547]  Just took the CHICOMS longer than 30 years.
[01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:05.671]  First got what, 1969?
[01:01:05.671 --> 01:01:09.332]  Do the math, 30, 40, 48 years.
[01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:13.953]  Holy guacamole, Batman!
[01:01:13.953 --> 01:01:16.834]  But let's get focused here.
[01:01:16.834 --> 01:01:27.337]  I just played clips of what airs on television and what airs on YouTube and what gets force-fed to children, teaching them how great it is to have abortions and how it's no big deal and how it makes you feel great to get one.
[01:01:30.603 --> 01:01:32.424]  Shout your abortion isn't trying to be woke.
[01:01:32.424 --> 01:01:35.264]  These women say they're trying to expand perception.
[01:01:35.264 --> 01:01:41.326]  Isn't that nice?
[01:01:41.326 --> 01:01:51.689]  And I'll remember Dr. Spock, not Dr. Spock of the USS Enterprise and Captain Kirk, you know, the Dr. Spock that taught everybody from the 60s on, don't ever tell your kids what to do.
[01:01:51.689 --> 01:01:53.289]  Don't ever tell them their identity.
[01:01:53.289 --> 01:01:55.070]  Let the state tell them what to do.
[01:01:56.860 --> 01:02:06.725]  And so now you don't tell your children any ideas or any of your values, you just let whatever failed comedian wants to come in and sexualize your kids, medicalize your children, come in and do that.
[01:02:06.725 --> 01:02:18.371]  And I was thinking about Sandusky, raping hundreds and hundreds of children, and when he finally got busted at Penn State, he was in the field house on a Saturday.
[01:02:18.371 --> 01:02:22.974]  Now you have to understand, college football plays football on Saturday.
[01:02:24.776 --> 01:02:32.540]  In the field house, in the middle of the day, having sex with an underage, I think the kid was like 10 years old?
[01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:34.261]  Raping him!
[01:02:34.261 --> 01:02:37.523]  Can we put a mug shot of Sandusky up?
[01:02:37.523 --> 01:02:42.525]  And it turned out that the head of the school covered it up, and Pertono covered it up.
[01:02:42.525 --> 01:02:46.747]  Well, yeah, folks, I know people that live up in that neck of the woods by the DuPonts.
[01:02:46.747 --> 01:02:51.650]  And let me tell you, if you want to find a place that's got more devil worship than San Francisco,
[01:02:53.157 --> 01:02:55.138]  Or Washington, D.C.
[01:02:55.138 --> 01:02:58.820]  There's one place, and that's Penn State.
[01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:00.781]  By the way, Trump went there.
[01:03:00.781 --> 01:03:02.342]  To the business school, Wharton Business.
[01:03:02.342 --> 01:03:04.523]  I'm not saying to strike against him.
[01:03:04.523 --> 01:03:05.843]  I got good friends who went to Penn State.
[01:03:05.843 --> 01:03:09.866]  But I'm just saying, let me tell you something.
[01:03:09.866 --> 01:03:12.527]  If there is a pedophile command base, baby,
[01:03:14.815 --> 01:03:16.616]  I found no evidence of Trump in pedophilia.
[01:03:16.616 --> 01:03:18.378]  The media tried to say that, it's not true.
[01:03:18.378 --> 01:03:20.119]  The Clintons, the rest of it, it's huge.
[01:03:20.119 --> 01:03:22.160]  But he did go to Wharton Business School there.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:35.510]  But you shake a stick in the dark, in Penn State, baby, you are running into not just molesting.
[01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:39.193]  So people sit there and they ask the question,
[01:03:40.589 --> 01:04:03.180]  How in the hell, all over the country, do they have young boys dressed up like girls, as young as 10, in cases we've seen, dancing provocatively, scantily clad, to men in a nightclub where people dance naked, shaking their ass, and getting money?
[01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:06.762]  Well, because we live in a world where Mr. Sandusky
[01:04:09.878 --> 01:04:15.703]  Why would Sandusky choose to not rape the little, what was it, a nine-year-old boy in his office?
[01:04:15.703 --> 01:04:21.249]  You know, he had his house by a local elementary school playground.
[01:04:21.249 --> 01:04:22.510]  Very creepy.
[01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:28.055]  Because you have to understand, to these people, doing it... See, you always hear about Satanists.
[01:04:28.055 --> 01:04:30.337]  They're taking over the Vatican, having sex in the churches.
[01:04:30.337 --> 01:04:31.638]  It's come out.
[01:04:31.638 --> 01:04:33.220]  Thousands of priests in Pennsylvania, again.
[01:04:34.136 --> 01:04:44.644]  Up to 10-15 priests raping little boys inside the church at night, reproducing the Holy Sacrament in the Eucharist, because it's called blasphemy.
[01:04:44.644 --> 01:04:48.006]  That's what you do in the real satanic Bible on Anthony Day.
[01:04:48.006 --> 01:04:54.451]  The real ones is you go and you do blood rituals in the church, and you blaspheme Christ.
[01:04:54.451 --> 01:04:55.832]  This is called devil worship.
[01:04:58.263 --> 01:05:02.386]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[01:05:02.386 --> 01:05:09.451]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[01:05:09.451 --> 01:05:14.275]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[01:05:14.275 --> 01:05:21.820]  The ProPure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system that will
[01:05:24.703 --> 01:05:36.737]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain, and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[01:05:37.177 --> 01:05:44.640]  With its broad-spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.

[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:29.147]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:29.147 --> 01:06:33.211]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:39.277 --> 01:06:42.898]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the day of doom is here, if they have their way.
[01:06:42.898 --> 01:06:47.719]  84 fake investigations, none of it Russiagate, coming out of the Democrat-controlled House.
[01:06:47.719 --> 01:06:53.900]  Nancy Pelosi, they're having the vote to ensconce her in the House of Representatives right now, and then she'll be sworn in.
[01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:55.501]  Let's go to some of that audio.
[01:06:55.501 --> 01:06:58.761]  Costa.
[01:06:58.761 --> 01:07:01.302]  Pelosi.
[01:07:01.302 --> 01:07:03.342]  Courtney.
[01:07:03.342 --> 01:07:05.643]  Pelosi.
[01:07:05.643 --> 01:07:07.063]  Cox of California.
[01:07:09.878 --> 01:07:12.379]  Pelosi.
[01:07:12.379 --> 01:07:12.859]  Craig.
[01:07:12.859 --> 01:07:18.341]  A lot of Pelosi's in the house.
[01:07:18.341 --> 01:07:19.021]  Crawford.
[01:07:19.021 --> 01:07:23.423]  We're going to go back to him in a moment with her being sworn in.
[01:07:23.423 --> 01:07:24.223]  Crenshaw.
[01:07:24.223 --> 01:07:26.464]  But first, I've asked the crew
[01:07:27.486 --> 01:07:45.782]  To look into the amazing Desmond, or Desmond the Amazing, he's known as both ways, who since he was 5, 6, 7 years old, I've seen on the national news, as a little boy that identifies as a girl and who now performs at gay strip clubs for $15 a head.
[01:07:50.154 --> 01:07:52.816]  As we noticed, he's promoted to school children around the country.
[01:07:52.816 --> 01:07:53.837]  There's been a new development.
[01:07:53.837 --> 01:07:55.638]  We were covering this last hour.
[01:07:55.638 --> 01:07:58.219]  As you know, a few weeks ago, he performed at this club.
[01:07:58.219 --> 01:08:01.702]  People said it's illegal to be in a bar for a child this age anyways.
[01:08:01.702 --> 01:08:03.423]  How is this going on?
[01:08:03.423 --> 01:08:04.984]  Where are the parents?
[01:08:04.984 --> 01:08:10.327]  Why is this being put up with?
[01:08:10.327 --> 01:08:14.870]  And then people started to notice that he's in another video with the drag queen.
[01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:16.271]  Never with his biological parents.
[01:08:16.271 --> 01:08:17.792]  He just seems to be off with all these people.
[01:08:17.792 --> 01:08:18.593]  The big news is coming.
[01:08:19.292 --> 01:08:31.259]  The Big New Development, and there he is with these people talking about snorting ketamine, which is a drug you take to basically go into a trance for group sex.
[01:08:31.259 --> 01:08:35.521]  I mean, I've heard about it, I've read about it, Burning Man, you name it.
[01:08:35.521 --> 01:08:36.622]  But it's a mind control drug.
[01:08:36.622 --> 01:08:41.805]  Well, now he looks very shriveled, very anorexic, very, he looks like a classic junkie.
[01:08:42.810 --> 01:08:54.436]  And he's being paraded around and passed around by all these people that shoot videos and talk about LGBTP, putting the pedophile on the end, and who talk about snorting the ketamine.
[01:08:54.436 --> 01:08:59.479]  And in the new video, there's a poster by an artist behind him talking about children taking rohibinol.
[01:08:59.479 --> 01:09:02.220]  And you go to the artist's website, it's all about demons and death.
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.601]  But it gets better!
[01:09:04.601 --> 01:09:06.282]  Look at this from Wikipedia!
[01:09:06.282 --> 01:09:07.183]  Michael Ehrlig,
[01:09:08.402 --> 01:09:12.350]  Who this young boy is with in the latest video about Rohib and all.
[01:09:12.350 --> 01:09:18.321]  In March of 96, Aylick and his roommate Robert D. Freeze Riggs killed fellow club kid, Club Kid.
[01:09:19.796 --> 01:09:24.257]  Andre Angel Melendez in a confrontation over a delinquent drug debt.
[01:09:24.257 --> 01:09:25.137]  Oh, no wonder.
[01:09:25.137 --> 01:09:27.498]  So this is a convicted... Wait till you hear.
[01:09:27.498 --> 01:09:30.699]  In October 97, A-League pled guilty to first-degree manslaughter.
[01:09:30.699 --> 01:09:33.279]  Both men were sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison.
[01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:36.220]  Riggs was released on parole in 2010.
[01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:42.902]  A-League on May 5, 2014 for dismembering the young gay man.
[01:09:42.902 --> 01:09:47.343]  Now, where is the amazing Desmond?
[01:09:47.343 --> 01:09:47.823]  Where is the...
[01:09:48.837 --> 01:09:50.298]  Well, he's with these guys.
[01:09:50.298 --> 01:10:07.448]  We're going to play some of that video in a moment, but first, let's play the video from last week that made national news, where he's with the drag queen with green hair, talking about snorting hardcore mind control drugs.
[01:10:07.448 --> 01:10:08.408]  Here it is.
[01:10:08.408 --> 01:10:09.969]  ...was right.
[01:10:09.969 --> 01:10:11.650]  What?
[01:10:11.650 --> 01:10:16.193]  See... Bellinoche, putting the P in LGBTQ clubs.
[01:10:18.057 --> 01:10:20.359]  You should eat some food, little nibba.
[01:10:20.359 --> 01:10:23.661]  But I'm getting hate comments, does this mean I'm famous now?
[01:10:23.661 --> 01:10:25.142]  Is this what he wants?
[01:10:25.142 --> 01:10:27.403]  Lots of respect for you guys, thank you!
[01:10:27.403 --> 01:10:29.004]  Press G to gas.
[01:10:29.004 --> 01:10:30.525]  G, G, G, G.
[01:10:30.525 --> 01:10:36.429]  1, 2, 3, 4, G. What has this world come to?
[01:10:36.429 --> 01:10:38.971]  It's come to a world where drag kids actually exist.
[01:10:38.971 --> 01:10:40.232]  And people do ketamine on a couch.
[01:10:42.819 --> 01:10:44.201]  How old is your BF?
[01:10:44.201 --> 01:10:44.562]  Hello?
[01:10:44.562 --> 01:10:45.924]  Hitler was right!
[01:10:45.924 --> 01:10:46.926]  Helicopter ride!
[01:10:46.926 --> 01:10:47.747]  Yay!
[01:10:49.417 --> 01:10:51.518]  Now, it's a long YouTube video.
[01:10:51.518 --> 01:10:52.398]  There's an hour of it.
[01:10:52.398 --> 01:10:53.559]  You want to go see more stuff?
[01:10:53.559 --> 01:10:54.899]  I don't know all the code words and stuff.
[01:10:54.899 --> 01:10:56.840]  People are freaking out over this, okay?
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:58.421]  Because it's just code word city.
[01:10:58.421 --> 01:11:03.183]  There's nothing code word about LGBTP or ketamine, you know, passing out on the couch with a kid.
[01:11:03.183 --> 01:11:05.484]  Little kid with another man dressed up like a woman.
[01:11:05.484 --> 01:11:06.344]  Where's mom and dad?
[01:11:06.344 --> 01:11:07.805]  They're normally on ABC News.
[01:11:07.805 --> 01:11:08.465]  How great they are.
[01:11:08.465 --> 01:11:09.466]  How great parents they are.
[01:11:09.466 --> 01:11:11.046]  You know, we've got all that.
[01:11:11.046 --> 01:11:12.207]  It's truly insane.
[01:11:12.207 --> 01:11:15.328]  Now, here's the next video.
[01:11:15.328 --> 01:11:17.029]  Here he is on another couch.
[01:11:17.921 --> 01:11:25.647]  With Michael Ehrling and another man with an image of a child jumping rope, talking about roofies or rohibinol.
[01:11:25.647 --> 01:11:27.628]  If you're a TV viewer, we'll go ahead and roll that video.
[01:11:27.628 --> 01:11:32.332]  Yeah, let's go ahead and roll the audio too, go ahead.
[01:11:32.332 --> 01:11:40.198]  So here they are reading to him about kids not having to go to school, do whatever they want.
[01:11:43.968 --> 01:11:52.893]  And again, there's all this drug paraphernalia words around, and it's with a man who pled guilty to chopping another man up.
[01:11:52.893 --> 01:11:53.834]  Now, where are the parents?
[01:11:53.834 --> 01:12:08.642]  You have a child that looks totally drugged out, who's performing at adult gay bars, with men throwing money at him, talking about using drugs, and celebration of children using drugs all over the walls, looking like he can hardly talk.
[01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:11.471]  He's the youngest club kid.
[01:12:11.471 --> 01:12:18.457]  A club kid is the name for a 17, 18 year old young man who they allow to slip into gay bars to have sex illegally underage.
[01:12:18.457 --> 01:12:19.638]  But oh, now you're the youngest club kid.
[01:12:19.638 --> 01:12:19.898]  You are 11!
[01:12:37.918 --> 01:12:47.766]  And you're with a guy who's only spent a few years in jail, because he's gay, it's okay, for murdering someone, chopping them up, named Michael Ehrlig.
[01:12:47.766 --> 01:12:50.568]  And this is what the Democratic Party stands for?
[01:12:50.568 --> 01:12:51.949]  This is who they are?
[01:12:51.949 --> 01:12:53.290]  This is who they want to be?
[01:12:53.290 --> 01:13:01.256]  And as we dig deeper into Michael Ehrlig, I'm sure of it now, I want to make a documentary about the amazing Desmond.
[01:13:03.223 --> 01:13:04.643]  What he's doing, where he lives.
[01:13:04.643 --> 01:13:08.905]  I want to go to the police and present this in his town and say, what in the hell?
[01:13:08.905 --> 01:13:10.285]  It's New York City.
[01:13:10.285 --> 01:13:12.026]  Have you people done?
[01:13:12.026 --> 01:13:22.969]  You have a minor being passed around by people to make YouTube videos about being the youngest club kid with convicted murderers.
[01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:27.168]  And people talking about mind control drugs with them.
[01:13:27.168 --> 01:13:33.891]  And the child looks like... I mean, if I got pulled over driving down the road at high noon, and I looked like that kid.
[01:13:33.891 --> 01:13:36.512]  Not the eye shadow, all that crap.
[01:13:36.512 --> 01:13:42.334]  If you look at those drugged eyes, if you look at how the latest photos of him, he's so skinny.
[01:13:42.334 --> 01:13:45.235]  It tears your guts out.
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:14:05.971]  So you remember that this kid is celebrated everywhere, and he's been handed down through the spider hole, and looks totally freaked out and totally scared if you really look at him, and that he's under Stockholm Syndrome, and keeps nodding his head like he's gonna fall down, and just looks totally exhausted and totally freaked out.
[01:14:05.971 --> 01:14:06.331]  Oh.
[01:14:06.331 --> 01:14:06.812]  My.
[01:14:06.812 --> 01:14:07.152]  God.
[01:14:07.152 --> 01:14:12.075]  And he's there with a murderer that chopped another man up that looks completely psychotic.
[01:14:14.005 --> 01:14:16.086]  But it's okay because it's gay and it's trendy.
[01:14:16.086 --> 01:14:17.347]  And this is the left in America.
[01:14:17.347 --> 01:14:18.468]  This is who you are.
[01:14:18.468 --> 01:14:24.932]  Here, let's see our Lord and Savior, Nancy Pelosi, who's getting a bunch of forced abortion money passed through the new budget.
[01:14:24.932 --> 01:14:26.713]  Let's go see these scums celebrating all this.
[01:14:26.713 --> 01:14:28.815]  Graves of Georgia.
[01:14:28.815 --> 01:14:31.517]  McCarthy.
[01:14:31.517 --> 01:14:34.338]  Graves of Louisiana.
[01:14:34.338 --> 01:14:37.841]  McCarthy.
[01:14:37.841 --> 01:14:40.302]  Graves of Missouri.
[01:14:40.302 --> 01:14:40.903]  McCarthy.
[01:14:43.982 --> 01:14:45.083]  Green of Tennessee.
[01:15:03.612 --> 01:15:30.162]  that this poor little boy has been paraded around on national television by the whole New York crime syndicate will end up either having a drug overdose or dying or committing suicide because he's passed around with convicted murderers and put on stage at gay clubs to have money thrown at him and is in a drug culture talking about snorting ketamine and and and and talking about rohibinol and just all of this in your face with him now with a convicted murderer who
[01:15:31.122 --> 01:15:41.671]  Chopped another man to pieces in a drug deal, and he's here talking about drugs with a little kid, and he's a convicted murderer!
[01:15:41.671 --> 01:15:42.892]  Hey, but you're a tough little boy.
[01:15:42.892 --> 01:15:44.173]  I mean little girl.
[01:15:44.173 --> 01:15:46.175]  Suck it up, kid!
[01:15:46.175 --> 01:15:51.439]  Suck it up and get in there with the murderers and the Rohyphenol and the Ketamine and the gay clubs.
[01:15:51.439 --> 01:15:53.261]  Suck it up, boy!
[01:15:53.261 --> 01:15:54.642]  Suck it up!
[01:15:54.642 --> 01:15:55.603]  That's what they're gonna make him do.
[01:15:57.168 --> 01:16:03.511]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:03.511 --> 01:16:06.553]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:06.553 --> 01:16:12.496]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:12.496 --> 01:16:16.278]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:16.278 --> 01:16:17.539]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:17.539 --> 01:16:18.880]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:24.583]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:25.083 --> 01:16:27.085]  Available at Amazon Books.

[01:17:27.011 --> 01:17:28.232]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:17:28.232 --> 01:17:32.154]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:32.154 --> 01:17:33.695]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:17:33.695 --> 01:17:36.657]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:36.657 --> 01:17:42.220]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:43.421]  I can help you, too.
[01:17:43.421 --> 01:17:46.362]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:17:46.362 --> 01:17:48.584]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:17:48.584 --> 01:17:53.026]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.

[01:17:59.884 --> 01:18:01.626]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:18:01.626 --> 01:18:03.127]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[01:18:03.127 --> 01:18:05.168]  Hashtag Alex Jones.

[01:18:10.072 --> 01:18:13.895]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:18:13.895 --> 01:18:21.941]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:18:22.862 --> 01:18:25.663]  I am patient zero in the massive banning.
[01:18:25.663 --> 01:18:32.925]  But you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[01:18:32.925 --> 01:18:36.887]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[01:18:36.887 --> 01:18:42.828]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[01:18:42.828 --> 01:18:47.350]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public, hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:50.411]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment!
[01:18:58.210 --> 01:19:07.497]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:19:07.497 --> 01:19:10.379]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:19:10.379 --> 01:19:16.423]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best idea in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:19:17.083 --> 01:19:23.349]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:19:23.349 --> 01:19:29.635]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:19:29.635 --> 01:19:36.682]  Now, due to the Establisher trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:19:36.682 --> 01:19:36.882]  But!
[01:19:37.723 --> 01:19:39.324]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:32.662 --> 01:20:37.186]  We're dealing with a nightmare situation, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:37.186 --> 01:20:53.201]  We are falling down a fetid, stinking spider hole at the bottom of which lie children that the globalist death state was unable to abort when they were in their mother, was unable to kill with tainted vaccines, was unable to scramble their brains.
[01:20:53.201 --> 01:20:55.724]  So instead, what we're dealing with here
[01:20:57.068 --> 01:21:01.449]  His children told that they're another gender, or that genders don't exist.
[01:21:01.449 --> 01:21:07.551]  And then leftist parents going on national television like Good Morning America and being celebrated.
[01:21:07.551 --> 01:21:11.552]  We'll roll some of that for TV viewers in the background.
[01:21:11.552 --> 01:21:16.273]  And then the child's parents being hailed as these wonderful, wonderful people.
[01:21:16.273 --> 01:21:19.494]  Now there is Desmond is Amazing a few years ago.
[01:21:19.494 --> 01:21:23.095]  We rolled video earlier where he looks like he is on heroin.
[01:21:25.453 --> 01:21:26.996]  And guess who he's hanging out with?
[01:21:26.996 --> 01:21:36.452]  We just noticed this from a movie called Party Monster, a documentary, that one of the crew remembered that he hangs out with Michael Ehrlich.
[01:21:37.898 --> 01:21:48.544]  Who is a convicted murderer who severed a, quote, party kid into multiple pieces and pled guilty for it and only served a few years in prison.
[01:21:48.544 --> 01:21:56.148]  Well, now Desmond is Amazing is hanging out with him with posters in the background with the word rohibinol or the date rape drug.
[01:21:56.148 --> 01:22:00.751]  And then in other videos, Desmond is Amazing talks about snorting ketamine on his arm.
[01:22:00.751 --> 01:22:03.432]  And lo and behold, I didn't know people already knew this.
[01:22:03.432 --> 01:22:04.673]  Desmond and the killer.
[01:22:05.731 --> 01:22:16.493]  The American conservative has a whole breakdown on this, and how he, the child works in gay clubs, having men throw money at him.
[01:22:16.493 --> 01:22:21.814]  11 years old, and this even violates child labor, violates liquor laws, but it's New York City.
[01:22:21.814 --> 01:22:24.874]  It's okay if your kid's hanging around with a guy that dismembers people.
[01:22:24.874 --> 01:22:29.595]  You can go on Good Morning America and say how cute it is and how fun it is.
[01:22:29.595 --> 01:22:34.936]  This is how sick Hollywood and the left is, and they have the souls of these destroyed children
[01:22:36.949 --> 01:22:41.112]  On their evil, wicked hands.
[01:22:41.112 --> 01:22:42.273]  Oh, and guess what?
[01:22:42.273 --> 01:22:48.998]  If you look deeper into all of this, we looked into it, both parents remain unemployed.
[01:22:48.998 --> 01:22:52.681]  Let's show for TV viewers the father.
[01:22:52.681 --> 01:22:57.205]  What a creepy, creepy, creepy, creepy crawly that guy looks like, you know.
[01:22:58.166 --> 01:23:00.988]  It kind of looks like Brian Stelter, doesn't it?
[01:23:00.988 --> 01:23:02.950]  I mean, he's got the look.
[01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:04.671]  And then there's Mommy.
[01:23:04.671 --> 01:23:06.092]  There's Mommy over there.
[01:23:06.092 --> 01:23:08.074]  You just had it on screen.
[01:23:08.074 --> 01:23:09.815]  There they are.
[01:23:09.815 --> 01:23:10.976]  Boy!
[01:23:10.976 --> 01:23:13.077]  And they're unemployed.
[01:23:13.077 --> 01:23:15.599]  Don't they need to have their finances looked into?
[01:23:15.599 --> 01:23:23.826]  Don't they need to look into... Well, I mean, he goes and it's $15 a head for, quote, gay men to come see their son dressed like a girl, dance and have money thrown at him.
[01:23:23.826 --> 01:23:25.987]  So how much are they making?
[01:23:25.987 --> 01:23:27.669]  No, I don't think they're unemployed.
[01:23:29.295 --> 01:23:31.736]  They're pimping their young son out.
[01:23:31.736 --> 01:23:35.258]  That's the definition when you send your child to a gay club.
[01:23:35.258 --> 01:23:36.439]  And it's all allowed.
[01:23:36.439 --> 01:23:38.340]  And now, I guess what, you rent him out?
[01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:40.141]  Is that, is this how that works?
[01:23:40.141 --> 01:23:42.823]  To, oh, this famous drag queen, to get some attention on YouTube.
[01:23:42.823 --> 01:23:47.465]  Or to this famous killer, Michael Ehrlich.
[01:23:47.465 --> 01:23:52.568]  Who is super famous in the whole pedophile investigation system online.
[01:23:52.568 --> 01:23:54.669]  His name just keeps popping up.
[01:23:54.669 --> 01:23:56.871]  That's how the crew remembered him.
[01:23:56.871 --> 01:23:58.892]  They said, that guy's name, it seems familiar.
[01:24:00.216 --> 01:24:07.140]  And there he is on the video, telling little boy, you're the youngest club kid ever.
[01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:10.342]  Well, what happened to the other club kid?
[01:24:10.342 --> 01:24:16.566]  In March of 96, Ayling and his roommate, Robert D. Freeze Riggs, killed fellow club kid, Andre Angel.
[01:24:18.208 --> 01:24:22.171]  Let's pull up the definition of a club kid from Urban Dictionary.
[01:24:22.171 --> 01:24:25.293]  Can we go to Urban Dictionary and type in definition, club kid?
[01:24:47.930 --> 01:24:49.152]  Definition Club Kid.
[01:24:49.152 --> 01:24:56.265]  Desperate, drugged out, young gay men, many of them underage, in there shelling themselves.
[01:24:56.265 --> 01:24:58.790]  There it is!
[01:24:58.790 --> 01:25:00.433]  Hell from Wikipedia while working!
[01:25:01.477 --> 01:25:05.439]  A-League studied the nightclub business and soon became a party promoter.
[01:25:05.439 --> 01:25:09.120]  His ability to stage memorable parties helped him rise in New York's party scene.
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:16.783]  During that time, A-League and other regular club goers began creating flamboyant personas that later became known as club kids.
[01:25:16.783 --> 01:25:24.446]  And the club kids wore outrageous costumes that former club kid and celebritante or James St.
[01:25:24.446 --> 01:25:28.028]  James later described as part drag, part clown, part
[01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:31.602]  Infantilism.
[01:25:31.602 --> 01:25:38.129]  I've got a big definition, I've got a big vocabulary, but what is infantilism?
[01:25:38.129 --> 01:25:39.811]  Infantilism, that's what I thought.
[01:25:39.811 --> 01:25:41.533]  I'm reading it from 20 feet away.
[01:25:41.533 --> 01:25:44.296]  Oh, acting like a baby!
[01:25:44.296 --> 01:25:49.181]  So you're a man that dresses like a girl, but also like a baby.
[01:25:49.181 --> 01:25:50.243]  Wonder who would be into that?
[01:25:51.491 --> 01:25:52.231]  Infantilism.
[01:25:52.231 --> 01:25:53.752]  I know what being infantile is.
[01:25:53.752 --> 01:25:55.572]  So infantilism.
[01:25:55.572 --> 01:25:59.494]  Not being infantile, but infantilism itself is being infantile.
[01:25:59.494 --> 01:26:00.594]  So there you go.
[01:26:00.594 --> 01:26:03.115]  Learn something every day.
[01:26:03.115 --> 01:26:06.736]  Oh, they're into going to gay clubs and acting like infants.
[01:26:09.210 --> 01:26:10.410]  Oh, and then they get into drugs.
[01:26:10.410 --> 01:26:12.091]  We're all learning this together.
[01:26:12.091 --> 01:26:13.792]  And later become known as club kids.
[01:26:13.792 --> 01:26:15.732]  The club kids wear outrageous costumes.
[01:26:15.732 --> 01:26:23.595]  Club kids, and I've been saying, these trannies are really clowns, which is It the Clown, which goes back to ancient satanic rituals.
[01:26:23.595 --> 01:26:25.716]  People are like, yeah, you said this years ago, but here it is.
[01:26:25.716 --> 01:26:26.776]  I didn't even know.
[01:26:26.776 --> 01:26:30.458]  The club kids wear outrageous costumes, like It the Clown, former club kids.
[01:26:32.364 --> 01:26:37.046]  Later described part-drag, part-clown, part-infantilism.
[01:26:37.046 --> 01:26:45.310]  They were also known to their frequent use of ketamine, known as Special K, Ecstasy, Rohypnol, Heroin, and Cocaine.
[01:26:45.310 --> 01:26:49.031]  What did I say this little kid, Desmond is Amazing, looks like?
[01:26:49.031 --> 01:26:50.572]  I said, looks like he's on heroin.
[01:26:50.572 --> 01:26:52.753]  He can barely hold his head up.
[01:26:52.753 --> 01:26:56.935]  A-League's club kids included among them, and then it goes on.
[01:26:56.935 --> 01:26:59.956]  And then it goes on to say how they basically are children.
[01:27:02.549 --> 01:27:10.947]  Wow, in plain view, national media worshipping a child that for years has been rented out by his parents.
[01:27:10.947 --> 01:27:11.428]  They admit.
[01:27:12.523 --> 01:27:21.846]  To gay bars, to dance provocatively for other men, and the poor child is on TV talking about using ketamine and other drugs.
[01:27:21.846 --> 01:27:26.648]  I mean, you talk about amazing, and this is the big no-no.
[01:27:26.648 --> 01:27:28.228]  This is the big no-no, I've been told.
[01:27:28.228 --> 01:27:31.549]  You don't talk about the scene in New York.
[01:27:31.549 --> 01:27:36.091]  I told you the whole Pizzagate thing was to distract us off New York and the WikiLeaks onto the pizza parlor.
[01:27:37.847 --> 01:27:40.209]  Wow, the parents are unemployed.
[01:27:40.209 --> 01:27:41.910]  Let's show their house again.
[01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:43.131]  Let's look at that again.
[01:27:43.131 --> 01:27:44.052]  They're unemployed.
[01:27:44.052 --> 01:27:46.714]  Wonder what their tax returns show.
[01:27:46.714 --> 01:27:49.456]  Wonder how much money their son's bringing in.
[01:27:49.456 --> 01:27:52.819]  Wow, he'll be too old soon, I guess.
[01:27:52.819 --> 01:27:55.501]  So, better get an... Oh, I bet they adopt.
[01:27:55.501 --> 01:27:58.423]  I bet that's coming next.
[01:27:58.423 --> 01:28:00.404]  I bet that's coming next.
[01:28:00.404 --> 01:28:02.086]  Oh my goodness, isn't it fun?
[01:28:03.837 --> 01:28:06.518]  Now there he is at about age five, dressed up like a girl.
[01:28:06.518 --> 01:28:07.378]  Oh, it's so sweet!
[01:28:07.378 --> 01:28:08.098]  It's so cute!
[01:28:08.098 --> 01:28:10.859]  Hollywood, this is what they're doing to your children.
[01:28:10.859 --> 01:28:14.419]  This is what they continue to do to your children.
[01:28:14.419 --> 01:28:16.780]  And this just makes me absolutely flip out.
[01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:22.561]  And on national TV, it's not creepy enough to have JonBenét Ramsey, obviously pedophilic, that whole thing, her getting killed.
[01:28:22.561 --> 01:28:25.322]  Obviously, a lot of those child pageants are super creepy.
[01:28:26.414 --> 01:28:39.238]  But now it's a bunch of men and women leering at him, acting like a girl, dressing sexy and laying down with their legs partially open on the ground on national television.
[01:28:39.238 --> 01:28:40.718]  Desmond is amazing.
[01:28:40.718 --> 01:28:46.000]  Let's get all your kids into this and we can feed them right into the big rat hole, big spider hole.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:54.262]  They can hang out with convicted killers that sever other gay men up and who invented this whole thing of acting infantile at gay clubs while other men have sex with you.
[01:28:54.662 --> 01:28:56.503]  Act like a baby while someone has sex with you.
[01:28:56.503 --> 01:28:57.343]  No big deal.
[01:28:57.343 --> 01:29:00.285]  At WolfhillAmmo.com, we love shotguns.

[01:31:57.777 --> 01:32:06.161]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[01:32:06.161 --> 01:32:07.622]  Believe me, I know.
[01:32:07.622 --> 01:32:12.324]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:32:12.324 --> 01:32:17.326]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[01:32:17.566 --> 01:32:37.720]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:41.983]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[01:32:54.955 --> 01:33:01.300]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:03.923]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:12.173 --> 01:33:22.715]  You lock the door And throw away the key There's someone in my head But it's not me
[01:33:40.498 --> 01:33:54.483]  Well, the Chinese yesterday landed an unmanned probe on the dark side of the moon.
[01:33:54.483 --> 01:33:58.664]  China lifts mysterious veil by landing probe on far side of the moon.
[01:34:00.202 --> 01:34:05.323]  A Chinese space probe successfully touched down on the far side of the moon on Thursday.
[01:34:05.323 --> 01:34:11.924]  China's space agency said, hailing the event as a historic first and major achievement for the country's space program.
[01:34:11.924 --> 01:34:19.145]  Of course, we reportedly haven't done it because you can't transmit from there that there's been a lot of probes over there, obviously.
[01:34:19.145 --> 01:34:25.026]  For whatever reason, they have not shown what they've gotten.
[01:34:25.026 --> 01:34:29.507]  Those first images are up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:40.324]  But if you think about it, the United States has sent probes to outside the solar system and all the gas giants along the way.
[01:34:40.324 --> 01:34:48.768]  These landed probes on comets and asteroids.
[01:34:48.768 --> 01:34:59.433]  We have gone to Venus and Mercury and to the Sun, flying probes into the Sun itself or into its corona before they evaporate.
[01:35:00.970 --> 01:35:03.091]  And I'm not in competition with the Communist Chinese.
[01:35:03.091 --> 01:35:10.774]  I just want to point out that we are decades and decades and decades and decades and decades and decades ahead of the Communist Chinese.
[01:35:10.774 --> 01:35:14.355]  And everything they've got and everything they've been given has been given to them.
[01:35:15.683 --> 01:35:16.324]  By us.
[01:35:16.324 --> 01:35:18.545]  And they've been given favorable trade deals.
[01:35:18.545 --> 01:35:20.927]  They've been given almost $2 trillion in U.S.
[01:35:20.927 --> 01:35:29.213]  security in Afghanistan so they can extract $40-plus billion a year of rare earth minerals and pay nothing for security there.
[01:35:29.213 --> 01:35:36.639]  That's American welfare to globalist companies like Apple and others to get their rare earth minerals.
[01:35:39.997 --> 01:35:44.680]  So that they can build all the computer chips and all the rest of it at our expense.
[01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:53.845]  That's how the Chai-coms have been given 98% control over all rare earth minerals that are needed for electronics in the modern world.
[01:35:53.845 --> 01:35:56.927]  We have been positioned to fail, period!
[01:35:59.158 --> 01:36:03.460]  And it makes me so angry that we've had globalist sabotage because the U.S.
[01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:07.041]  would be out so far ahead of everybody else.
[01:36:07.041 --> 01:36:24.848]  We would have already so many advanced technologies deployed to the public that the globalist plan of austerity and cutting off resources before we ever become basically free of the earth, they'll have a chance to suppress that through renaissance.
[01:36:26.977 --> 01:36:28.478]  And what did Trump say in his inauguration?
[01:36:28.478 --> 01:36:49.071]  He said, we will transfer power back to the people and back to the nation-state from the globalists, and we will release a lot of these innovative technologies and treatments and systems that will bring us into the next technological revolution that will allow us to innovate out of our debts, which has been proven to be the only way to get out of these debt bubbles.
[01:36:49.926 --> 01:36:57.651]  But instead, there's a Financial Times article today that's been syndicated, saying the New World Order is robotics and is a technocracy.
[01:36:57.651 --> 01:37:02.754]  Yes, that's what they said at Davos ten years ago and five years ago.
[01:37:02.754 --> 01:37:04.174]  That's why I call them technocrats.
[01:37:04.174 --> 01:37:05.995]  They call themselves that.
[01:37:05.995 --> 01:37:16.962]  And they're deploying advanced technologies and systems with government initiative money, not to empower humanity, but to build an anti-human future in the future.
[01:37:20.563 --> 01:37:32.788]  Global tech show to celebrate innovation amid mounting concerns.
[01:37:32.788 --> 01:37:40.492]  Robots and artificial intelligence could be the new world order, republic world.
[01:37:40.492 --> 01:37:45.414]  That's just some of the news that I'm looking at here.
[01:37:50.043 --> 01:37:54.445]  Another article that's interesting.
[01:37:54.445 --> 01:38:01.527]  Venezuela's lesson for American socialists out of Bloomberg of all places.
[01:38:01.527 --> 01:38:09.690]  And they go on to admit that socialism and communism creates a nightmare scenario and is absolutely horrible.
[01:38:09.690 --> 01:38:17.973]  So occasionally, the globalists actually let the truth come out.
[01:38:17.973 --> 01:38:19.654]  But that's only because they want socialism
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:30.805]  for the general public, communism for the general public, while they sit offshore, immune from the entire thing.
[01:38:30.805 --> 01:38:39.629]  So they want to have it both ways, where they don't pay taxes, but everybody else does.
[01:38:39.629 --> 01:38:47.293]  And then you look at blue cities, and socialist and communist and leftist run areas of the world, like France and other areas, Chicago,
[01:38:48.663 --> 01:39:07.598]  They're nightmare hellholes where the establishment doesn't pay taxes, they have diplomatic immunity, they have private islands, private jets, private yachts, and then they lecture everyone all day on how bad middle classes are and how everyone has to live in austerity.
[01:39:07.598 --> 01:39:11.001]  And then that next leads us to China.
[01:39:12.819 --> 01:39:13.960]  And Apple.
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:16.162]  And why the stock market's down 600 points today.
[01:39:16.162 --> 01:39:19.825]  In fact, let's look up CNBC right now on screen, please.
[01:39:19.825 --> 01:39:20.806]  Whatever the latest is.
[01:39:20.806 --> 01:39:22.747]  It was 650 points earlier.
[01:39:22.747 --> 01:39:26.670]  Dow Jones Industrial Average this morning.
[01:39:26.670 --> 01:39:29.833]  And it's because the Democrats are announcing they're going to try to impeach Trump.
[01:39:29.833 --> 01:39:34.336]  They're announcing they're going to try to indict Trump.
[01:39:34.336 --> 01:39:36.798]  They are saying they're going to kill the recovery.
[01:39:36.798 --> 01:39:42.163]  They're saying the regulatory bodies are going to roll back regulations that he got rid of and that they're going to bring them back.
[01:39:43.234 --> 01:39:46.055]  They're gonna roll back Trump's reforms?
[01:39:46.055 --> 01:39:58.239]  First Apple sank 10% now it's back to 8% on pace for biggest single day loss in six years.
[01:39:58.239 --> 01:40:04.621]  And they're there cheerleading for everything to collapse.
[01:40:04.621 --> 01:40:05.441]  In our faces,
[01:40:06.638 --> 01:40:16.484]  Thinking we're so dumb we won't remember Bill Maher and Nancy Pelosi and all the rest of them saying we're going to stop Trump's reforms and we're going to stop this recovery to teach him a lesson.
[01:40:16.484 --> 01:40:19.546]  Or the globalists saying we're going to teach all these European countries lessons.
[01:40:19.546 --> 01:40:20.707]  We're going to crush their economies.
[01:40:20.707 --> 01:40:29.693]  But the good news is in Austria and Poland and in Hungary and in France and in Germany they're voting all these monsters out.
[01:40:29.693 --> 01:40:35.377]  They're pulling down the UN flags, the EU flags, and they're saying we're not going to have an EU army.
[01:40:36.617 --> 01:40:42.519]  You want an EU army to get rid of our nation states and oppress us and open the gates to the illegal aliens?
[01:40:42.519 --> 01:40:46.260]  You are the enemy, so that's the beginning of the end of the EU.
[01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:56.424]  They won't be able to collapse it and then reorganize it into a Marshall Plan, a bigger program, out of that crisis to fully take over Europe because Europeans now know about that scam.
[01:40:56.424 --> 01:41:02.166]  And once the gates open, once the genie's out of the bottle, once Pandora's box is opened,
[01:41:03.439 --> 01:41:08.581]  There's nothing they can do on Earth to reverse all of that.
[01:41:08.581 --> 01:41:11.382]  And we, of course, have exposed all those plans years ago.
[01:41:11.382 --> 01:41:13.943]  Not just the current operations, but their next move, and their next move.
[01:41:13.943 --> 01:41:17.004]  And that's why they can't stand us being here on air.
[01:41:17.004 --> 01:41:19.965]  Because you're all supposed to just roll over and take it!
[01:41:19.965 --> 01:41:21.346]  You're not supposed to know about their plan!
[01:41:21.346 --> 01:41:23.107]  You're supposed to be too stupid!
[01:41:23.107 --> 01:41:26.108]  Or, you're supposed to be bought off by them.
[01:41:26.108 --> 01:41:30.809]  And if you won't take their money, then they'll just lie about you and try to destroy you.
[01:41:30.809 --> 01:41:31.950]  And most people, pew!
[01:41:33.413 --> 01:41:35.495]  Are willing to roll over.
[01:41:35.495 --> 01:41:37.757]  But not me.
[01:41:37.757 --> 01:41:38.557]  Because I understand.
[01:41:38.557 --> 01:41:44.162]  There's no future if we do that.
[01:41:44.162 --> 01:41:51.528]  And if you consciously know about the evil and you join with it, you become it and lose your very soul.
[01:41:52.992 --> 01:41:54.833]  And that ain't for sale.
[01:41:54.833 --> 01:42:00.217]  And once you realize that, there's no question of why we have to fight this, of why we have to resist it.
[01:42:00.217 --> 01:42:02.258]  All right, I'm gonna go to break, and I'm gonna come back.
[01:42:02.258 --> 01:42:11.124]  It's not a sales gimmick that the year-end super sale is still going, and I keep saying last day for the last two days.
[01:42:11.124 --> 01:42:18.669]  I have been in meetings, I have been working on news, I have been working on innovation, I have been working on new products, and I just have not gotten around
[01:42:19.944 --> 01:42:20.625]  We're good to go.
[01:42:37.103 --> 01:42:39.325]  Storewide is going.
[01:42:39.325 --> 01:42:42.228]  Today's got to be the last day because a bunch of stuff sold out.
[01:42:42.228 --> 01:42:48.854]  But whether it's Brain Force Plus, the last run of X2, or Super Metal Vitality, or whatever those great products are, it's all the biggest sales ever.
[01:42:48.854 --> 01:42:50.296]  Year-end clearance sale.
[01:42:50.296 --> 01:42:51.617]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:42:51.617 --> 01:42:52.838]  Thanks for your support.

[01:42:58.843 --> 01:43:00.564]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:43:00.564 --> 01:43:02.085]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[01:43:02.085 --> 01:43:04.127]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:43:04.127 --> 01:43:09.030]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:12.832]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:43:12.832 --> 01:43:20.898]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:43:21.818 --> 01:43:24.621]  I am patient zero in the massive banning.
[01:43:24.621 --> 01:43:31.887]  But you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[01:43:31.887 --> 01:43:35.830]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:41.795]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[01:43:41.795 --> 01:43:44.818]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[01:43:44.818 --> 01:43:46.319]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:43:46.319 --> 01:43:49.382]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[01:43:52.654 --> 01:43:57.336]  And the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit!
[01:43:57.336 --> 01:44:01.298]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:44:01.298 --> 01:44:04.580]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:07.401]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater.
[01:44:07.401 --> 01:44:10.842]  And we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:44:10.842 --> 01:44:13.624]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:44:14.364 --> 01:44:18.168]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:44:18.168 --> 01:44:24.654]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:44:24.654 --> 01:44:29.618]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:44:30.359 --> 01:44:34.280]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:41.482]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:44:41.482 --> 01:44:46.184]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:44:46.184 --> 01:44:52.386]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:44:52.386 --> 01:44:56.367]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:44:58.612 --> 01:45:00.933]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[01:47:01.232 --> 01:47:03.874]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:20.563 --> 01:47:23.204]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:47:23.204 --> 01:47:42.814]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:47:42.814 --> 01:47:49.417]  Okay, we have a special guest, a journalist, an actress joining us, who's written a very powerful article
[01:47:50.794 --> 01:48:04.983]  Dealing with how Twitter is taking all the conservatives off, Mindy Robinson, but leaving all of the pedophiles up there to operate.
[01:48:04.983 --> 01:48:06.844]  So that is coming up.
[01:48:06.844 --> 01:48:11.147]  I covered it some on Monday and requested we get her on.
[01:48:11.147 --> 01:48:12.608]  Can I have that article reprinted?
[01:48:12.608 --> 01:48:13.909]  Thank you very much.
[01:48:13.909 --> 01:48:18.412]  Her article was also posted to InfoWars.com.
[01:48:19.878 --> 01:48:23.960]  Now, if you talk about this, you get banned or blocked on Twitter.
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:40.389]  This is who they really protect, and that's why they did the whole Pizzagate hoax, real pedophilia in the WikiLeaks, real stuff going on in D.C., and having the media focus on 4chan and stuff that they could go plant themselves that wasn't true, to then discredit the whole thing.
[01:48:40.389 --> 01:48:45.672]  When you've got the whole Vatican getting busted, Penn State, you know, just everything.
[01:48:45.672 --> 01:48:46.493]  Just everywhere.
[01:48:48.015 --> 01:48:51.537]  Throw a stick and have it stick in the mud without there being pedophilia.
[01:48:51.537 --> 01:49:15.554]  I wasn't even trying to cover this last hour, and it came out that Desmond, the amazing Desmond, this poor little boy who has unemployed parents for years that they send off to make money at gay bars, and they parade around on TV, that he hangs around with convicted murderers and drug dealers, and then he talks about using ketamine and rohiminol.
[01:49:16.892 --> 01:49:26.374]  And then I guess he's leased out to these men to then put him on YouTube and have him make very creepy comments.
[01:49:26.374 --> 01:49:31.835]  This is par for the course.
[01:49:31.835 --> 01:49:36.416]  And this is the type of degeneracy that is now announcing your children belong to them.
[01:49:36.416 --> 01:49:40.237]  And because you're all afraid when they come to your school dressed like demon clowns,
[01:49:41.773 --> 01:49:51.536]  As party kids, as it's called, that's what this fusion is, where you act like a baby, you act like a woman, you act like a man, and the whole thing is homoerotic with your children.
[01:49:51.536 --> 01:49:52.597]  And they admit that.
[01:49:52.597 --> 01:49:54.817]  I didn't even know that there was a Wikipedia about it.
[01:49:54.817 --> 01:50:02.280]  I didn't even know the founder of it spent a decade in prison for murdering somebody, and now he's in videos with this poor little boy.
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:05.701]  And they've got signs up talking about rohibinol behind him.
[01:50:05.701 --> 01:50:08.982]  I didn't even... I just said, the Satanists wear clown outfits,
[01:50:10.225 --> 01:50:16.147]  And they have other people that simulate being children as the entryway to pedophilia, and then it's real children.
[01:50:16.147 --> 01:50:23.488]  Because I've studied the devil worship from history books, from people that I've known that were inside of it, and from law enforcement.
[01:50:23.488 --> 01:50:30.610]  But law enforcement even gets told, don't talk about this.
[01:50:30.610 --> 01:50:33.751]  And poor little Desmond, not his real name,
[01:50:43.593 --> 01:50:47.796]  He is patient zero in all this.
[01:50:47.796 --> 01:50:49.517]  He's what they're rolling out in schools everywhere.
[01:50:49.517 --> 01:50:50.718]  He's in textbooks.
[01:50:50.718 --> 01:50:52.979]  He's what your kid needs to do.
[01:50:52.979 --> 01:50:54.500]  And then, hey, career day.
[01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:55.441]  They come and teach you.
[01:50:55.441 --> 01:50:56.362]  You're five years old.
[01:50:56.362 --> 01:51:03.066]  You can wear a dress and dance at the gay bar.
[01:51:03.066 --> 01:51:09.671]  Desmond Naples is a child drag performer who gained popularity in 2017 following his public performances.
[01:51:11.519 --> 01:51:21.504]  His status as a LGBT celebrity was further developed on social media announcement of the Instagram page called Hoss of Amazing.
[01:51:21.504 --> 01:51:23.446]  Isn't that just cute from Wikipedia?
[01:51:23.446 --> 01:51:35.592]  And then you go over to Wikipedia where it has where he hangs out and does YouTube videos with convicted murderers that started all this.
[01:51:35.592 --> 01:51:36.933]  So we're going to be discussing
[01:51:38.573 --> 01:51:42.214]  All of that, we're going to be looking at all of it in the next hour.
[01:51:42.214 --> 01:51:43.654]  And there's a whole other angle of that.
[01:51:43.654 --> 01:51:46.295]  Shout your abortion isn't trying to be woke.
[01:51:46.295 --> 01:51:57.818]  These women say they're trying to expand perception when they get access to schools, quote, feminist groups to teach your daughters how great it is to get an abortion.
[01:51:57.818 --> 01:52:01.979]  Whatever you do, you get those children.
[01:52:06.766 --> 01:52:10.568]  Oh, and they're also reporting that Desmond is autistic.
[01:52:10.568 --> 01:52:12.769]  So, he doesn't even know what's hitting.
[01:52:12.769 --> 01:52:14.309]  And what do educators in the UK say?
[01:52:14.309 --> 01:52:20.112]  They say, listen, we've gone from 1 in a couple thousand kids having autism to 1 in 50-something.
[01:52:20.112 --> 01:52:30.056]  And mainly, the schools coming in with psychologists and getting young boys, mainly to say they're girls, at age 5, by age 6 or 7 in the UK, they begin the chemical castration.
[01:52:31.681 --> 01:52:34.802]  So they're abusing autistic children doing this.
[01:52:34.802 --> 01:52:42.944]  According to his parents, he is on the autism spectrum and his drag activity helps him deal with the symptoms.
[01:52:42.944 --> 01:52:46.544]  Oh my goodness, how nice!
[01:52:46.544 --> 01:52:56.607]  And hanging around with all these people and a little kid who dances at gay bars and talks about snorting ketamine and hangs out with convicted murderers.
[01:52:56.607 --> 01:52:57.907]  And it's all like the more
[01:52:59.924 --> 01:53:01.204]  Sick it is, the better.
[01:53:01.204 --> 01:53:04.025]  And by the way, he was openly gay in kindergarten.
[01:53:04.025 --> 01:53:07.126]  Oh, I'm sure his parents didn't put any of that in his head.
[01:53:07.126 --> 01:53:12.087]  I mean, this is like the NAMBLA statement in your face.
[01:53:12.087 --> 01:53:16.667]  And you got NBC News, ABC News, CBS News, Good Morning America up there praising it.
[01:53:16.667 --> 01:53:19.208]  Look, I've got all this other incredible news.
[01:53:19.208 --> 01:53:22.009]  Nancy Pelosi's daughter saying they're going to cut Trump's head off.
[01:53:22.009 --> 01:53:23.709]  He won't know what hit him.
[01:53:23.709 --> 01:53:28.790]  YouTube begins injecting direct links to CNN at top of search results, not just gaming them all.
[01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:32.331]  And then I have that clip I sent you guys.
[01:53:32.331 --> 01:53:33.431]  I didn't see it in my list.
[01:53:33.431 --> 01:53:34.171]  It may be here.
[01:53:34.171 --> 01:53:35.652]  I bet it is.
[01:53:35.652 --> 01:53:41.553]  But the bottom of this article on Infowars.com, there is... I just need another video list.
[01:53:41.553 --> 01:53:42.974]  I'm sure I just lost it.
[01:53:42.974 --> 01:53:52.016]  At the bottom of this, there is a video by Sundar Pichai three weeks ago when I was there.
[01:53:52.016 --> 01:53:52.816]  And good, it's there.
[01:53:52.816 --> 01:53:53.837]  Thank you.
[01:53:53.837 --> 01:53:54.697]  And Sundar...
[01:53:56.678 --> 01:53:59.139]  Says that we never alter individual search results.
[01:53:59.139 --> 01:54:05.701]  Of course, there's thousands of documents, tons of public videos, statements by the company, they do it in live time.
[01:54:05.701 --> 01:54:18.285]  This was like him saying the conference room he was in at the House of Representatives and the Judiciary Committee did not have wood paneling.
[01:54:18.285 --> 01:54:21.525]  So when we come back, I'm going to get to that report.
[01:54:21.525 --> 01:54:26.187]  But it'd be like him saying, I'm not in the House of Representatives.
[01:54:27.250 --> 01:54:29.213]  But you are, in the House of Representatives.
[01:54:29.213 --> 01:54:30.675]  But, here it is!
[01:54:30.675 --> 01:54:41.512]  They have Google executives, the media, bragging how all, and professors, I told you, the professors in journalism school and the media, the dying dinosaur, it's job is it polices.
[01:54:42.535 --> 01:54:47.419]  And calls YouTube, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and says, take this down, take that down.
[01:54:47.419 --> 01:54:53.003]  Why, did you know that Alex Jones is the top result, or Paul Joseph Watson, or did you know this is going on?
[01:54:53.003 --> 01:54:57.306]  And then it's their job to force, feed, and place everything at the top.
[01:55:03.479 --> 01:55:08.361]  And then they lie to Congresswoman Gohmert and everyone else to their faces.
[01:55:08.361 --> 01:55:12.723]  So the message we've got to get to Congress is this article from InformationLiberation.com.
[01:55:12.723 --> 01:55:14.263]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:55:14.263 --> 01:55:25.748]  Get it and get it to your Republican member of Congress and demand they understand that Sundar is at the bottom of the video saying one thing.
[01:55:25.748 --> 01:55:27.309]  You understand that?
[01:55:27.309 --> 01:55:32.551]  Sundar is at the bottom of the video saying one thing, saying that we never change the search results.
[01:55:33.607 --> 01:55:48.113]  And then here they are bragging throughout it with examples of sometimes dozens of pages, usually 30 deep, of Trump comes out and responds to Mitt Romney.
[01:55:48.113 --> 01:55:52.875]  When you search for that, they don't show you the president responding, they show you Mitt Romney.
[01:55:52.875 --> 01:56:00.217]  And then if you do find Trump, way down deep with his latest statement, they then superimpose CNN links
[01:56:02.378 --> 01:56:07.060]  Saying Trump's a liar, get the truth.
[01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:22.547]  Just like I said earlier, Buzz Aldrin came on and talked about how they found this obelisk sending a transmission from the moon of Mars, and how I had him on, but they deleted my YouTube channel so I couldn't find it, and lo and behold they found it, but there was an Encyclopedia Britannica
[01:56:24.491 --> 01:56:40.454]  information laid over it saying don't listen to Buzz Aldrin that walked on the moon listen to this just because it's me they put that over it to act like oh see we're going to give some context to this and see pretty soon it's just ban
[01:56:44.690 --> 01:56:46.871]  All the major preachers.
[01:56:46.871 --> 01:56:48.291]  Pretty soon it's banned everything.
[01:56:48.291 --> 01:56:52.293]  Pretty soon it's banned anybody talking about sexualization of children.
[01:56:52.293 --> 01:57:02.937]  So if Franklin Graham won't stand up, and the Republican Congress won't stand up, there's no limit to them lying to Congress, and stealing our birthright, and gaming everything, and giving you false results, because obviously
[01:57:04.958 --> 01:57:09.503]  15,000 fact-checkers trained by the Southern Poverty Law Center and Media Matters and paid for with U.S.
[01:57:09.503 --> 01:57:16.171]  taxpayer money laundered through Soros operations on record, then decide Franklin Graham can't be on Facebook.
[01:57:18.536 --> 01:57:24.019]  But that's not enough, because they know you're going to search 30 pages down to actually find the real stuff.
[01:57:24.019 --> 01:57:26.821]  So now they just put CNN over it all!
[01:57:26.821 --> 01:57:34.465]  Just like they forced you to watch it at the airport, or at the hotel, or the bar, or the restaurant, or the bus, or at the gas pump they've got up now.
[01:57:34.465 --> 01:57:37.147]  Now you're going to watch it no matter what you do!
[01:57:37.147 --> 01:57:40.009]  You type in InfoWars.com, you're going to get CNN!
[01:57:40.009 --> 01:57:44.371]  You're going to watch Don Lemon and Brian Stelter!
[01:57:44.371 --> 01:57:45.732]  But they're not tyrants at all!

[01:59:50.799 --> 01:59:53.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:01.329 --> 02:00:06.273]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:00:06.273 --> 02:00:10.075]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:10.075 --> 02:00:16.180]  So, all over the western world, there's a coming out of the pedophiles sexualizing our children.
[02:00:16.180 --> 02:00:17.881]  They're really vampires.
[02:00:17.881 --> 02:00:20.463]  They want their energy.
[02:00:20.463 --> 02:00:25.966]  We have an investigative journalist and actress who's been writing about it and exposing it coming up, joining us in the next segment.
[02:00:25.966 --> 02:00:27.728]  So please, stay with us for that.
[02:00:28.831 --> 02:00:33.376]  But the next level of degeneracy taking over is here, and we're now the underdogs.
[02:00:33.376 --> 02:00:35.318]  Franklin Graham's now the underdog.
[02:00:35.318 --> 02:00:37.300]  Michael Savage is now the underdog.
[02:00:37.300 --> 02:00:40.023]  Anyone telling the truth is now the underdog.
[02:00:40.023 --> 02:00:48.232]  And now it's bad to not want your child to hang out with convicted murderers when they're 11 years old and talk about how they're using ketamine and all the rest of it.
[02:00:48.232 --> 02:00:50.775]  Now that's a beautiful, wonderful thing, even though it's all illegal.
[02:00:52.571 --> 02:00:55.572]  Meanwhile, this story is really important from InfoWars.com.
[02:00:55.572 --> 02:01:00.574]  YouTube begins injecting direct links to CNN at top of search results.
[02:01:00.574 --> 02:01:05.455]  So it's not enough that they feed CNN as the search result for everything news related at the top.
[02:01:05.455 --> 02:01:07.236]  It's not the algorithm of what's popular anymore.
[02:01:07.995 --> 02:01:10.278]  They're gonna be something with a thousand views versus a million.
[02:01:10.278 --> 02:01:12.381]  They'll put the globalist thing up top.
[02:01:12.381 --> 02:01:18.388]  Now they put CNN links over the feed of everything I say, Trump says, or anybody else says.
[02:01:18.388 --> 02:01:22.734]  This is big tech absolutely abusing everybody in a big way.
[02:01:24.565 --> 02:01:25.265]  Manipulation of search results.
[02:01:25.265 --> 02:01:27.346]  I think it's important to talk about how search works.
[02:01:27.346 --> 02:01:29.046]  Right now, if you Google the word idiot,
[02:01:53.866 --> 02:01:59.097]  Under images, a picture of Donald Trump comes up.
[02:01:59.097 --> 02:02:00.740]  I just did that.
[02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:02.002]  How would that happen?
[02:02:02.002 --> 02:02:05.629]  How does search work so that that would occur?
[02:02:08.092 --> 02:02:13.497]  We provide search today for any time you type in a keyword.
[02:02:13.497 --> 02:02:27.070]  We, as Google, we have crawled, we've gone out and crawled and stored copies of billions of webpages in our index and we take the keyword and match it against webpages.
[02:02:29.626 --> 02:02:34.671]  That's how Google and every other search engine worked.
[02:02:34.671 --> 02:02:39.737]  That's how the NSA would record your phone call and scan it, create a text, and then be able to search the text.
[02:02:39.737 --> 02:02:41.779]  This is all NSA technology from 30 years ago.
[02:02:41.779 --> 02:02:43.641]  35, 40 years ago.
[02:02:43.641 --> 02:02:49.307]  It's how voice print works, all of it.
[02:02:49.307 --> 02:02:49.808]  And now,
[02:02:51.448 --> 02:02:59.238]  He's just telling her, oh this is how we do it, when they're on record doing nothing but positive results for Hillary, nothing but gaming, everything.
[02:02:59.238 --> 02:03:02.542]  Pelosi's about to be sworn in here, we'll go to that live in a moment.
[02:03:02.542 --> 02:03:05.186]  But let's just go back to Sundar lying to everyone, here it is.
[02:03:05.814 --> 02:03:06.414]  We're good to go.
[02:03:25.945 --> 02:03:27.546]  They just announced Pelosi the winner.
[02:03:27.546 --> 02:03:28.666]  So let's go back to Sundar.
[02:03:28.666 --> 02:03:29.547]  More lies.
[02:03:29.547 --> 02:03:31.687]  We never manipulate individual results.
[02:03:31.687 --> 02:03:34.329]  Total perjury before Congress.
[02:03:34.329 --> 02:03:35.689]  But the Democrats, they run it.
[02:03:35.689 --> 02:03:37.210]  They don't care.
[02:03:37.210 --> 02:03:41.732]  And Google goes and buys them off for a few thousand dollars a year.
[02:03:41.732 --> 02:03:42.852]  Let's go back to Sundar.
[02:03:42.852 --> 02:03:47.654]  Behind the curtain, figuring out what we're going to show the user.
[02:03:47.654 --> 02:03:54.057]  It's basically a compilation of what users are generating and trying to sort through that information.
[02:03:54.728 --> 02:04:04.614]  Last year we served over 3 trillion searches, and just as a fact, every single day, 15% of the searches Google sees, we have never seen them before.
[02:04:04.614 --> 02:04:06.095]  Alright, pause again.
[02:04:06.095 --> 02:04:12.780]  Yeah, but with keywords like Alex Jones or Donald Trump, you have set feeds of what goes on top.
[02:04:12.780 --> 02:04:18.023]  Until two years ago, all the top searches were me, because we had the most views, it was our channel, it was set to that.
[02:04:18.023 --> 02:04:20.885]  The algorithm picked up that we were dominant in the name Alex Jones.
[02:04:21.883 --> 02:04:27.727]  It got reset to everything negative and you go to YouTube and type in Alex Jones and all you get is negative.
[02:04:27.727 --> 02:04:30.729]  Sundar though thinks you're all a big fat moron.
[02:04:31.570 --> 02:04:38.672]  But go see Google employees, Google execs, professors in media bragging how they go in every day and control everything.
[02:04:38.672 --> 02:04:43.934]  And they read your personal messages, they read your email, Twitter does it, they just abuse everyone.
[02:04:43.934 --> 02:04:47.155]  But they've already committed so many crimes, why not commit millions more?
[02:04:47.155 --> 02:04:48.735]  Why not surveil you?
[02:04:48.735 --> 02:04:50.216]  Why not move to China?
[02:04:50.216 --> 02:04:51.316]  Why not suppress speech?
[02:04:51.316 --> 02:04:53.037]  Why not ban Franklin Graham?
[02:04:53.037 --> 02:04:53.517]  Why not?! !
[02:04:56.348 --> 02:05:03.815]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want an alternative, InfoWars Lite has the formula for you.

[02:05:44.093 --> 02:05:46.840]  Paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil or used separately.
[02:05:46.840 --> 02:05:50.509]  It's time to see what Krill Oil can do for you with Ultimate Krill Oil.
[02:05:50.509 --> 02:05:52.654]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com
[02:06:18.311 --> 02:06:21.883]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:06:21.883 --> 02:06:23.228]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:37.509 --> 02:06:45.214]  Well, Nancy Pelosi just got confirmed by the vote in the leadership for the House of Representatives to be the speaker.
[02:06:45.214 --> 02:06:56.241]  I didn't mean to go off into a two-hour breakdown of Desmond Naples off and on, but they've had his parents parading him around since he was in kindergarten when he openly decided he was gay.
[02:06:57.564 --> 02:07:17.556]  And now they've been unemployed, but he gets paid, I guess they make money off of it, to dance at gay bars, that would be illegal for anybody else to do, it is illegal, where there's liquor sold, and they have money thrown at him, and he talks in all these videos with famous murderers, and founders of what they call club kids, where they behave like babies in gay bars, on drugs.
[02:07:17.556 --> 02:07:21.379]  He talks about ketamine on video, he talks about rohibonol,
[02:07:22.499 --> 02:07:25.300]  I just thought I'd mention that because it's just so unspeakable.
[02:07:37.455 --> 02:07:40.736]  That this is what the Democratic Party and everyone has signed on to.
[02:07:40.736 --> 02:07:46.838]  But Mindy Robinson is a Los Angeles-based actress and TV personality from Fault River.
[02:07:46.838 --> 02:07:51.619]  She has become a prolific character actor, accumulating 150 appearances on TV and film.
[02:07:51.619 --> 02:07:58.942]  Her improv skills gained exposure over 30 network reality shows as a personality, and her extensive work in independent film continues to add to her
[02:07:59.762 --> 02:08:00.022]  I don't
[02:08:17.361 --> 02:08:22.945]  But I wanted to get her on because she's written some really powerful articles and has the courage to cover all of this.
[02:08:22.945 --> 02:08:27.809]  Because especially out in Hollywood, you criticize the pedophilia and the sexualization of children.
[02:08:27.809 --> 02:08:29.170]  That is their mainstay.
[02:08:29.170 --> 02:08:30.891]  They really try to blackball you.
[02:08:30.891 --> 02:08:34.034]  The big article she wrote for Red White and F.U.
[02:08:34.034 --> 02:08:34.855]  There's no F.U.
[02:08:34.855 --> 02:08:38.137]  It's just Red White and the letter F.U.
[02:08:38.137 --> 02:08:38.978]  dot com.
[02:08:38.978 --> 02:08:44.222]  There's a new movement by pedophiles that legalize all forms of virtual child porn.
[02:08:45.529 --> 02:08:47.291]  And they admit all this.
[02:08:47.291 --> 02:08:51.995]  So simulated child porn is now what they want to push.
[02:08:51.995 --> 02:08:56.619]  And we see Twitter, Facebook, YouTube actually have been caught pushing this, promoting it.
[02:08:56.619 --> 02:09:00.722]  And then if you try to expose the targeting of children, that's one of the things I got told.
[02:09:00.722 --> 02:09:03.365]  Leave Islamics alone.
[02:09:03.365 --> 02:09:06.127]  Leave the pedophiles alone.
[02:09:06.127 --> 02:09:09.029]  And basically, we'll leave you alone.
[02:09:09.887 --> 02:09:12.975]  So that's what we've created in this nation.
[02:09:12.975 --> 02:09:17.868]  And so as we start the new year here, I really want to focus in on the children being targeted.
[02:09:18.746 --> 02:09:23.468]  Also, in the schools, not just with sexualization, but with communism and with racial division.
[02:09:23.468 --> 02:09:24.308]  We've played those clips.
[02:09:24.308 --> 02:09:28.009]  Or with elementary students being told how great abortion is.
[02:09:28.009 --> 02:09:31.111]  This is not the school's place to be doing this, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:31.111 --> 02:09:35.212]  So the left spent decades telling parents, don't be involved with your children.
[02:09:35.212 --> 02:09:36.733]  Let them figure it out for themselves.
[02:09:36.733 --> 02:09:38.994]  That means let the state indoctrinate them.
[02:09:38.994 --> 02:09:41.975]  But now we know that folks that warned us were right.
[02:09:41.975 --> 02:09:44.956]  This is about the total takeover of children.
[02:09:44.956 --> 02:09:47.157]  And you may not have children.
[02:09:47.157 --> 02:09:47.557]  I have four.
[02:09:48.357 --> 02:09:55.802]  But if you'll just send these articles on to everyone you know that have children, you'll raise the alarm and go to city council and you know, speak about it.
[02:09:55.802 --> 02:10:04.827]  The power of you at the grassroots calling into C-SPAN, calling into talk radio, going and meeting with your congressmen and women, getting involved will shake the world.
[02:10:04.827 --> 02:10:15.474]  And you know, there's a graphic, I'll actually pull up on my phone here in a moment, that shows the amount of arrest of pedophiles and other child traffickers are up ten-fold
[02:10:18.223 --> 02:10:24.146]  They're up ten-fold now, ladies and gentlemen, since Trump got in.
[02:10:24.146 --> 02:10:29.728]  I was just going to renew my children's passports and get the first passport for my 20-month-old.
[02:10:29.728 --> 02:10:34.710]  And before you go pay an expediting place, you have all your proof and everything, and then they would go take care of it.
[02:10:34.710 --> 02:10:35.891]  No, now, I don't do that.
[02:10:35.891 --> 02:10:40.273]  I go to the courthouse, and I've got to actually be there and do the whole process.
[02:10:40.273 --> 02:10:41.653]  And that's actually a good thing.
[02:10:41.653 --> 02:10:43.594]  I was shocked at how easy it was before.
[02:10:43.594 --> 02:10:45.195]  Trump has ended all of that.
[02:10:46.229 --> 02:11:02.942]  So with the UN, and all the child trafficking, and with all the things that have been going on, and the Catholic Church getting busted, and the ordered cover-ups, and the Deputy Pope trafficked over 100 children, the average person who isn't into this can't believe it's happening.
[02:11:02.942 --> 02:11:09.567]  So we're kind of blindsided when it just all comes out in the open in a giant bum rush to get to our kids as soon as they can.
[02:11:09.567 --> 02:11:11.989]  And you're like, but it's reckless, it's crazy, it's nuts!
[02:11:13.291 --> 02:11:17.732]  These predators, ladies and gentlemen, want to destroy the energy and the innocence of your child.
[02:11:17.732 --> 02:11:24.995]  The demons controlling them, is the best way to describe it, are so hungry they don't care about the flesh bag that gets them to your kids.
[02:11:24.995 --> 02:11:28.656]  They're uncontrollable monsters.
[02:11:28.656 --> 02:11:32.017]  And they're making their big Nambla move right now.
[02:11:32.017 --> 02:11:34.918]  Mindy Robinson, thank you so much for joining us today.
[02:11:34.918 --> 02:11:36.659]  Hey, how are you doing?
[02:11:38.188 --> 02:11:39.591]  We're good.
[02:11:39.591 --> 02:11:43.358]  I mean, I followed you on YouTube and Facebook, and I think we've interviewed you a few times here before.
[02:11:43.358 --> 02:11:49.590]  I know some of the other shows have, and I'm familiar with your work, but tackling this, living out in L.A., that takes a lot of huevos.
[02:11:51.178 --> 02:11:54.680]  Yeah, you know, I kind of walk the line between both worlds.
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:59.101]  I get to work in the industry, independent film, because Lord knows I'm blacklisted and everything else.
[02:11:59.101 --> 02:12:04.224]  And you know, this is my background with politics, American history, and then I started talking about politics.
[02:12:04.224 --> 02:12:06.685]  And I kind of fell into exposing these pedophiles.
[02:12:06.685 --> 02:12:11.247]  It's not something normal people would know to look for, to think to look for.
[02:12:11.247 --> 02:12:14.108]  And I'm in a position where I don't have children.
[02:12:15.028 --> 02:12:19.010]  And a lot of people that try to do what I do with children, that's the first thing they do.
[02:12:19.010 --> 02:12:23.573]  They find your kids, they leave disgusting comments, they keep pictures, they do that kind of thing.
[02:12:23.573 --> 02:12:30.076]  So I'm in a position where I'm lucky and unlucky enough to expose these pedophiles, and there are hundreds.
[02:12:30.456 --> 02:12:33.177]  I found hundreds just this week, and Twitter will not remove them.
[02:12:33.177 --> 02:12:38.959]  They can remove you, they can remove Laura Luhrer, they can remove everyone they want that they don't, you know, whose opinions they don't like.
[02:12:38.959 --> 02:12:51.983]  But I'm flagging comments that say sex with children is okay, and Twitter won't pull them down, or even worse, they pretend to pull it down, and then it's back up in a day, you know, hoping we wouldn't notice, I guess, is their motivation.
[02:12:51.983 --> 02:12:56.324]  And then you tie this in with the
[02:12:58.206 --> 02:13:05.371]  Total move against our children in the schools by groups literally founded by famous pedophiles.
[02:13:05.371 --> 02:13:06.872]  It's wild.
[02:13:06.872 --> 02:13:11.336]  Yeah, I used to think the indoctrination of our youth started in college.
[02:13:11.336 --> 02:13:12.457]  I had to avoid it.
[02:13:12.457 --> 02:13:15.679]  You know, I had to take those mandatory bullshit classes.
[02:13:15.679 --> 02:13:17.420]  And it started much younger than that.
[02:13:17.420 --> 02:13:22.264]  I mean, they're teaching your kids this awful stuff.
[02:13:22.264 --> 02:13:24.746]  I don't think parents are fully aware, and I think they need to
[02:13:25.615 --> 02:13:29.037]  Either not let their children online or go through absolutely everything.
[02:13:29.037 --> 02:13:30.899]  I mean, did you see some of these profiles?
[02:13:30.899 --> 02:13:32.840]  These are necrophiliacs.
[02:13:32.840 --> 02:13:36.723]  These are people that are into molesting babies and toddlers.
[02:13:36.723 --> 02:13:40.786]  These are soulless gobs—and it's crazy, they're all leftists.
[02:13:40.786 --> 02:13:43.708]  I mean, it's not that I don't think that there are child molesters on the right.
[02:13:44.108 --> 02:13:50.190]  But these people are on mountaintop screaming about how they love to sexualize little children they want to touch.
[02:13:50.190 --> 02:13:58.652]  And yes, they want to legalize virtual child-porn, which is realistic graphics, which is video games, which is cartoon and manga.
[02:13:58.652 --> 02:13:59.812]  What the hell?
[02:13:59.812 --> 02:14:05.734]  I never thought in my life I would be fighting this and fighting an uphill battle because the mainstream media will not report on it.
[02:14:05.734 --> 02:14:08.475]  They're just going to continue to harass conservatives for speaking out.
[02:14:08.475 --> 02:14:09.955]  And I think it is linked to Islam.
[02:14:09.955 --> 02:14:11.196]  I actually do.
[02:14:11.196 --> 02:14:12.416]  I can't critique Islam.
[02:14:13.016 --> 02:14:16.658]  About how young they marry, how many wives they get to marry, how many wives they get to be.
[02:14:16.658 --> 02:14:18.639]  I can't say that without getting a ban hammer.
[02:14:18.639 --> 02:14:25.082]  And by the way, like any cult or gang, they have all the code words and all the things that they're into.
[02:14:25.082 --> 02:14:30.805]  And we've seen mainstream media try to do a facelift to this and say it doesn't exist, but it's breaking out everywhere.
[02:14:30.805 --> 02:14:32.866]  It's being confirmed.
[02:14:32.866 --> 02:14:34.687]  They're everywhere trying to get after our children.
[02:14:34.687 --> 02:14:35.928]  I mean, these people mean business.
[02:14:37.441 --> 02:14:37.881]  Absolutely!
[02:14:37.881 --> 02:14:41.462]  I mean, I went through a lot of trouble to find the codes they use.
[02:14:41.462 --> 02:14:42.562]  I mean, maps.
[02:14:42.562 --> 02:14:46.783]  They'll say no maps, which doesn't mean they're against a map that's a minor attractive person.
[02:14:46.783 --> 02:14:50.523]  And then they'll call themselves no maps, which doesn't mean they're against it, because that's what it would sound like.
[02:14:50.523 --> 02:14:52.424]  It's no offending maps.
[02:14:52.424 --> 02:14:55.004]  They haven't offended...yet.
[02:14:55.004 --> 02:14:57.825]  I mean, it's a set up for failure in life if you're attracted to three-year-olds.
[02:14:57.825 --> 02:15:00.745]  Sorry, you should not be around children, you should not be around anyone.
[02:15:00.745 --> 02:15:02.825]  You know, and I found these codes, I found these flags.
[02:15:02.825 --> 02:15:05.986]  You know what's even better is if you go to Snopes, Snopes denies that this exists.
[02:15:08.109 --> 02:15:10.157]  Even though it's out there?
[02:15:10.157 --> 02:15:12.264]  Even though it's in the FBI's own manuals on this?
[02:15:14.346 --> 02:15:16.787]  Yeah, they, uh, that's how they find each other.
[02:15:16.787 --> 02:15:21.048]  You know, they use, like, maps is what they're using, and when we catch on to that, they'll use something else.
[02:15:21.048 --> 02:15:24.229]  But they are openly being attracted to children.
[02:15:24.229 --> 02:15:25.610]  They will say, I'm a proud pedophile.
[02:15:25.610 --> 02:15:27.070]  Look at some of these hashtags.
[02:15:27.070 --> 02:15:32.212]  How does Twitter, you know, if I put MAGA, hashtag MAGA, half the time, you know, my tweet disappears.
[02:15:32.212 --> 02:15:38.014]  But you can put hashtag pedo, pedophile, proud pedo, and it pops right back up.
[02:15:40.148 --> 02:15:43.874]  Well, it's been the goal to sexualize children and ruin them as early as possible.
[02:15:43.874 --> 02:15:46.799]  They can't abort them, they want to sterilize them.
[02:15:46.799 --> 02:15:48.822]  And they want to get them on drugs as soon as possible.
[02:15:48.822 --> 02:15:51.767]  That's the goal of the entire New Freedom Initiative.
[02:15:51.767 --> 02:15:52.288]  We'll be right back.

[02:17:24.844 --> 02:17:31.188]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:17:31.188 --> 02:17:34.230]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:34.230 --> 02:17:40.153]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:40.153 --> 02:17:43.956]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:43.956 --> 02:17:45.216]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:45.216 --> 02:17:46.557]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:46.557 --> 02:17:52.761]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[02:17:52.761 --> 02:17:54.202]  Available at Amazon Books.
[02:17:56.454 --> 02:18:01.317]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.

[02:19:13.677 --> 02:19:13.957]  I think?

[02:19:53.691 --> 02:19:54.392]  With Z Field.
[02:19:54.392 --> 02:19:59.796]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:19:59.796 --> 02:20:02.438]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:28.200 --> 02:20:31.841]  You know, I remember back in February.
[02:20:31.841 --> 02:20:33.361]  By the way, Alex Jones here back live.
[02:20:33.361 --> 02:20:33.921]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:20:33.921 --> 02:20:35.062]  I remember back in February of 2017.
[02:20:35.062 --> 02:20:49.165]  There were busts of 427 pedophiles with little kids in cages in California and dead kids and dead women and there were hundreds caught here and hundreds caught there and then you never see it in the news again.
[02:20:49.725 --> 02:21:00.008]  It just gets shut down and then you see Google delist it where you search it and can't even find it unless you can find the original link.
[02:21:00.008 --> 02:21:11.132]  And that's when you get not even scared, that's when you start pinching yourself and you go, I've had thousands of newspapers, thousands.
[02:21:11.994 --> 02:21:15.516]  And they put the order out that it'll be on thousands of local TV affiliates.
[02:21:15.516 --> 02:21:19.237]  Because they've learned locals trust local news, they don't trust national news.
[02:21:19.237 --> 02:21:22.059]  And Jones makes it up!
[02:21:22.059 --> 02:21:23.119]  There's pedophiles!
[02:21:23.119 --> 02:21:26.420]  They don't exist!
[02:21:26.420 --> 02:21:40.487]  Meanwhile, thousands of priests admit to raping children in Pennsylvania alone, thousands of nuns, all these other institutions doing it, Hollywood, convicted rapists producing major films, all of it coming out, all the death.
[02:21:41.653 --> 02:21:44.816]  And then all the other sex cults and everything else.
[02:21:44.816 --> 02:21:52.322]  And I'm not somebody that ever used to even talk about pedophilia, but it's the religion of these people.
[02:21:52.322 --> 02:22:03.651]  And to watch corporate media try to cover up for Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton and Hillary and their whole background and the Podesta emails about there'll be kids in the hot tub for your pleasure.
[02:22:05.247 --> 02:22:11.191]  We don't know how they'll behave, you know, some are as young as seven, but they're kids, but they've been tried out.
[02:22:11.191 --> 02:22:13.172]  They should service you well.
[02:22:13.172 --> 02:22:19.256]  By the way, are you coming over next week for the Alistair Crowley ritual?
[02:22:19.256 --> 02:22:24.920]  I mean, it says we're having the Alistair Crowley ritual next week.
[02:22:24.920 --> 02:22:25.600]  Are you coming?
[02:22:25.600 --> 02:22:29.803]  There'll be blood and semen and women's breast milk on the menu.
[02:22:33.311 --> 02:22:48.063]  And you just sit back and then like John Podesta's brother, Tony Podesta, is in the 2007 Washington Post bragging about his deviant art of images of naked little boys tied up, which we won't even show on air.
[02:22:48.063 --> 02:22:56.350]  I will not show the Washington Post that they put in the local Washington Post section of the paper.
[02:22:56.350 --> 02:23:00.354]  It's so far gone that it's in the newspaper.
[02:23:01.601 --> 02:23:07.365]  And then the media goes, Jones says they're killing kids in a basement at a pizza place.
[02:23:07.365 --> 02:23:14.370]  And then edits video of me talking about stuff that happened in the Middle East under Hillary.
[02:23:14.370 --> 02:23:16.331]  We're going to have our guest with us for this segment, the next.
[02:23:16.331 --> 02:23:29.720]  I mean, I want to talk about this with you because, Mindy Robinson, because you've written one of the most powerful articles that's up to date just on how there's this coming out, how they're all over the news saying, we want access to your kids.
[02:23:31.178 --> 02:23:32.919]  You then look at who's leading it.
[02:23:32.919 --> 02:23:34.581]  It's convicted murderers.
[02:23:34.581 --> 02:23:36.422]  It's convicted drug dealers.
[02:23:36.422 --> 02:23:40.345]  It's people that promote NAMBLA and access to your kids.
[02:23:40.345 --> 02:23:53.255]  And then you've got an article you sent us where you've got major newspapers coming out and making pedophiles that get killed victims of a hate crime.
[02:23:53.255 --> 02:23:55.217]  And it just gets crazier from then.
[02:23:55.217 --> 02:23:59.781]  So how would you describe your awakening and then what you
[02:24:01.084 --> 02:24:02.488]  In your public research you're saying?
[02:24:04.842 --> 02:24:11.524]  I've run the political page, my Facebook, and I have a huge interaction with my followers.
[02:24:11.524 --> 02:24:15.446]  And thanks to them, they're the ones that send me that off comment.
[02:24:15.446 --> 02:24:18.827]  You know, there's always that something off and then they check it out and it turns out to be worse.
[02:24:18.827 --> 02:24:19.567]  They send it to me.
[02:24:19.567 --> 02:24:20.827]  I will look at it!
[02:24:20.827 --> 02:24:24.449]  You know, I'm not, I've sent, I sent the same article I sent to you to everyone.
[02:24:24.449 --> 02:24:25.249]  They don't care.
[02:24:25.249 --> 02:24:26.649]  I called out NBC.
[02:24:26.649 --> 02:24:28.310]  They don't care, but I care.
[02:24:28.310 --> 02:24:33.932]  And because I do, and because I'm out there doing it, every ten minutes I'm getting sent something else.
[02:24:34.804 --> 02:24:35.765]  That is just as bad.
[02:24:35.765 --> 02:24:42.551]  Like yesterday, we had NBC glorifying a pedo with this fluff piece.
[02:24:42.551 --> 02:24:46.894]  He was handsome, and he was so good in school, and he's from a sleepy little town.
[02:24:46.894 --> 02:24:50.918]  And these mean, evil vigilantes tricked him.
[02:24:50.918 --> 02:24:53.520]  This guy thought he was showing up for a 14-year-old Tinder date.
[02:24:54.632 --> 02:24:57.616]  And the whole thing is just, we thought it was a romance novel.
[02:24:57.616 --> 02:25:05.165]  It's violence discussing, and there is a mainstream attempt to normalize and desensitize people to pedophilia.
[02:25:05.165 --> 02:25:06.107]  This is what they want.
[02:25:06.107 --> 02:25:07.528]  They will not witness.
[02:25:07.528 --> 02:25:09.871]  And they're silencing everyone that speaks out.
[02:25:09.871 --> 02:25:12.595]  My followers that are calling out these pedophiles,
[02:25:13.536 --> 02:25:23.427]  By the way, by the way, by the way, Mindy, in airports, everywhere I go, people say, you get back after those pedophiles.
[02:25:23.427 --> 02:25:25.529]  We are, but people are on fire.
[02:25:25.529 --> 02:25:27.952]  They're angry, they're pissed, and they're not going away.
[02:25:27.952 --> 02:25:28.533]  And like you said,
[02:25:29.373 --> 02:25:38.719]  Vice, the New York Times, Shalon, all glorify pedophiles with videos of four-year-old girls that these dudes are drooling over.
[02:25:38.719 --> 02:25:45.983]  So there's this new form of pedophilia where people voyeuristically get off on hearing about pedophilia and kids being raped.
[02:25:45.983 --> 02:25:48.865]  I mean, all I got to say is, I'm sorry.
[02:25:48.865 --> 02:25:50.926]  Anybody tries to hurt a child needs killing.
[02:25:53.575 --> 02:25:53.975]  Keep going, sorry.
[02:25:53.975 --> 02:25:55.816]  Well, you can't say that because you'll get banned, apparently.
[02:25:55.816 --> 02:26:00.157]  So, uh, I had two followers get banned for saying pedophiles should be killed.
[02:26:00.157 --> 02:26:02.378]  But the pedophiles are on there, they're running free.
[02:26:02.378 --> 02:26:05.959]  And Twitter is kind of their main way to keep each other together.
[02:26:05.959 --> 02:26:08.220]  That's why they have... Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
[02:26:08.220 --> 02:26:11.180]  And Pelosi can say, you know, they're going to cut Trump's head off, that's okay.
[02:26:11.180 --> 02:26:19.743]  But if we say you can try to kidnap a kid and rape him, and, you know, slit their throat and throw him in the back of a garbage dump, you say those people deserve to be killed, you're a bad person.
[02:26:19.743 --> 02:26:22.524]  Because, like you said, NBC glorifies little precious pedos.
[02:26:24.190 --> 02:26:25.010]  Absolutely.
[02:26:25.010 --> 02:26:30.712]  I mean, this is what we're up against, and it's actually kind of terrifying.
[02:26:30.712 --> 02:26:34.274]  They make it sound like it's a disorder and that there's nothing they can do to help it.
[02:26:34.274 --> 02:26:35.434]  Yeah, that's kind of my point.
[02:26:35.434 --> 02:26:37.975]  That's why you need to be in jail forever, you know?
[02:26:37.975 --> 02:26:43.277]  And they're using Twitter to find each other, and what they do in these chat rooms is even worse.
[02:26:43.277 --> 02:26:44.217]  That's where they're sharing
[02:26:44.637 --> 02:26:48.759]  The content, the child porn, you know, just links to anything.
[02:26:48.759 --> 02:26:51.021]  This is where they do their grooming.
[02:26:51.021 --> 02:26:54.242]  Because if you notice, every single profile is a cartoon picture.
[02:26:54.242 --> 02:26:57.584]  It's a happy, anime, rainbow, cartoon slide picture.
[02:26:57.584 --> 02:26:59.385]  They're trying to be appealing to kids.
[02:26:59.385 --> 02:27:01.546]  And you know, and the first thing they do is like, well, DM me.
[02:27:01.546 --> 02:27:02.747]  Private message me.
[02:27:02.747 --> 02:27:03.567]  That's what they want.
[02:27:03.567 --> 02:27:06.369]  They don't want the world to see what they're doing, but this is what they're doing.
[02:27:06.369 --> 02:27:09.590]  And they're using Twitter to stay together, to have a community.
[02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:10.411]  There's hundreds.
[02:27:11.451 --> 02:27:13.912]  You know, that's a key point you make.
[02:27:13.912 --> 02:27:28.795]  You see these, it's all My Little Pony, it's cartoons, they go target kids sections of these websites, then they glorify Todd Nickerson, who is, again, the only person that looks more like a pedophile than Todd Nickerson is Brian Stelter.
[02:27:28.795 --> 02:27:31.335]  I might be sure.
[02:27:31.335 --> 02:27:38.497]  I'm not saying Brian Stelter's a pedophile, I'm just saying, I'm just saying, if you expected what a pedophile would look like, wouldn't it look like Todd Nickerson?
[02:27:40.399 --> 02:27:41.780]  It would, actually.
[02:27:41.780 --> 02:27:44.042]  Well, he says he is a pedophile.
[02:27:44.042 --> 02:27:45.524]  Well, yeah, but I mean, he looks like it.
[02:27:45.524 --> 02:27:48.386]  He's like, I wouldn't let him babysit.
[02:27:48.386 --> 02:27:50.028]  Would you let Brian Stelter babysit?
[02:27:50.028 --> 02:27:52.069]  I don't let anyone babysit.
[02:27:52.069 --> 02:27:53.170]  I don't trust anyone anymore.
[02:27:53.170 --> 02:27:53.731]  Are you kidding me?
[02:27:55.424 --> 02:27:56.545]  I think everyone should have a background.
[02:27:56.545 --> 02:28:02.670]  What about, what's wrong with, if Todd wants to dress in drag and come talk to your five-year-old in school, then it's okay, right?
[02:28:02.670 --> 02:28:14.080]  He's going to teach your daughter that she's a boy and your son that he's a girl, and if your child identifies with that, in Europe, in Sweden, at age nine, he's allowed to come date your daughter or son.
[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:16.782]  What's wrong with Todd Nickerson coming and dating your daughter or son?
[02:28:18.522 --> 02:28:21.584]  Well, there'll be a gun here waiting for him, that's what.
[02:28:21.584 --> 02:28:24.086]  Oh no, Todd!
[02:28:24.086 --> 02:28:29.710]  And Todd gets to... See, as the Democrats, all over the world, liberals want to get rid of the age of consent.
[02:28:29.710 --> 02:28:32.011]  For vaccines, for sex.
[02:28:32.011 --> 02:28:34.273]  Old Toddy boy.
[02:28:34.273 --> 02:28:36.854]  Old Todd, ain't never seen a woman that doesn't run from him.
[02:28:36.854 --> 02:28:40.457]  But if he could get one when they're little, and scared and can't run.
[02:28:40.457 --> 02:28:42.718]  Because they always act like how much they love their kids.
[02:28:42.718 --> 02:28:44.600]  There's always the real side.
[02:28:46.749 --> 02:28:49.332]  Because we all know what pedophilia is really about.
[02:28:49.332 --> 02:28:54.178]  Torturing your children for months and sucking the energy out until they're all used up.

[02:29:56.266 --> 02:30:04.655]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:30:04.655 --> 02:30:06.117]  Believe me, I know.
[02:30:06.117 --> 02:30:10.822]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:30:10.822 --> 02:30:15.827]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:30:16.047 --> 02:30:36.210]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[02:31:07.424 --> 02:31:16.173]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[02:31:16.173 --> 02:31:20.738]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.

[02:32:07.722 --> 02:32:11.523]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.

[02:32:20.525 --> 02:32:30.569]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the censors now and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[02:32:30.569 --> 02:32:34.531]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.

[02:32:40.493 --> 02:32:43.514]  Call and talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[02:32:43.514 --> 02:32:45.015]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:32:45.015 --> 02:32:48.056]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[02:32:51.303 --> 02:32:52.984]  We're all living in America!
[02:32:52.984 --> 02:32:54.084]  America es wunderbar!
[02:32:54.084 --> 02:32:54.745]  We're all living in
[02:33:21.983 --> 02:33:23.705]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:33:23.705 --> 02:33:24.145]  to 3 p.m.
[02:33:24.145 --> 02:33:25.567]  I'm here.
[02:33:25.567 --> 02:33:35.437]  Pat Brackenfos at the 4th hour, Owen Schroer coming up in the 3 o'clock hour, into the 4 o'clock and 5 o'clock hour, until 6 o'clock central with the war room.
[02:33:35.437 --> 02:33:45.027]  And by the way, I was in a good mood today until they showed me the famous little drag queen kid whose parents have told me he was gay since he was two years old now.
[02:33:45.487 --> 02:33:53.791]  We're doing more research, and who now don't have jobs, but he's rented out to gay clubs and rented out to hang out with mass murderers or killers, excuse me.
[02:33:53.791 --> 02:33:57.373]  The guy's only cut up one person, chopped him up, one person.
[02:33:57.373 --> 02:34:03.496]  So he's a dismemberer, only killed one person, and talks about taking ketamine on YouTube.
[02:34:03.496 --> 02:34:07.958]  I mean, if I was talking about taking ketamine, that's evidence I need to be SWAT teamed.
[02:34:07.958 --> 02:34:10.639]  Or Rohibinol, the date rape drug.
[02:34:10.639 --> 02:34:11.460]  And I'm telling you, man,
[02:34:13.160 --> 02:34:22.668]  This whole sexualization of kids is happening as the offense to normalize this as the Catholic Church has been taken over by this and other groups try to normalize it.
[02:34:22.668 --> 02:34:24.009]  But it's not going to work.
[02:34:24.009 --> 02:34:30.894]  It's kind of like the Terminator, Skynet's already been destroyed in the future by John Connor.
[02:34:30.894 --> 02:34:35.178]  So they sent Terminator back to try to kill John Connor when he's a kid.
[02:34:38.018 --> 02:34:38.678]  See how that works?
[02:34:38.678 --> 02:34:42.419]  So, the whole pedophile system's being exposed.
[02:34:42.419 --> 02:34:44.060]  They didn't normalize it.
[02:34:44.060 --> 02:34:48.641]  So, worldwide, they're just trying to sexualize kids and just say it's normal, so it's okay, it happened.
[02:34:48.641 --> 02:34:51.102]  What did the Pope say last year?
[02:34:51.102 --> 02:34:58.904]  When a, quote, gay man, as the media spun it, said, hey, I was raped at age 6, 7, 8, you know, as a little kid by the Catholic priest.
[02:34:58.904 --> 02:35:02.305]  And the Pope said, it's okay that you're gay.
[02:35:02.305 --> 02:35:05.026]  Saying, it's okay the priest gave you that gift of rape.
[02:35:06.894 --> 02:35:18.423]  And so as I've said, it's terrible to rape women, but oh my God, if you even can't call a woman, whistle at them, why that's some form of evil rape or just masculinity is toxic.
[02:35:18.423 --> 02:35:27.471]  But if it's a little boy, that's what I've said about Hollywood, is that it's rampant the abuse of men.
[02:35:27.471 --> 02:35:32.575]  It's bad for women too, but it is absolutely, totally rampant.
[02:35:33.530 --> 02:35:37.253]  And then these guys have had so many other men that it doesn't make them excited.
[02:35:37.253 --> 02:35:38.414]  Now they want kids.
[02:35:38.414 --> 02:35:43.838]  And it happened in every other culture, right before cultures totally and completely collapsed.
[02:35:43.838 --> 02:35:50.703]  And so, quantify this, because you're a smart lady, Mindy Robinson, actress turned journalist.
[02:35:50.703 --> 02:36:00.331]  Now that you see your followers on Instagram and on Facebook and on YouTube and on your own website, redwhiteandfu.com, just the letter F.
[02:36:02.477 --> 02:36:03.738]  Because it's the same with me.
[02:36:03.738 --> 02:36:10.964]  That is the most common thing I get is, you know, you shouldn't have backed off on Pizzagate.
[02:36:10.964 --> 02:36:13.866]  And I always say, I didn't back off.
[02:36:13.866 --> 02:36:17.669]  I told the crew, I think it's a honeypot, just this one pizza place.
[02:36:17.669 --> 02:36:22.593]  We know pizza uses a code word, and the old pedophile rings, that's in the FBI manuals.
[02:36:22.593 --> 02:36:25.095]  We know it's all in these New York emails.
[02:36:26.127 --> 02:36:37.454]  We've got them on this, and I had all sorts of sources in the police department, you name it, that all diverts to this pizza place with CNN covering it to distract it away from all the real stuff.
[02:36:37.454 --> 02:36:45.818]  That's all I said was, yes, I get how they distracted us off into that and that there wasn't a basement in this place.
[02:36:45.818 --> 02:36:46.599]  I never said that.
[02:36:46.599 --> 02:36:47.760]  People covered that.
[02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:49.541]  I have a right to cover what people said.
[02:36:49.541 --> 02:36:53.003]  But they try to snapshot one area of an investigation
[02:36:53.817 --> 02:36:55.942]  It'd be like if the cops were after bank robbers.
[02:36:55.942 --> 02:36:57.566]  There were six guys that robbed a bank.
[02:36:57.566 --> 02:36:58.950]  And they catch five of the guys...
[02:37:00.661 --> 02:37:07.045]  Different locations the next day, but the sixth location, they go there, it's the wrong location, and they bust the wrong guy.
[02:37:07.045 --> 02:37:08.726]  Is the whole investigation busted?
[02:37:08.726 --> 02:37:09.607]  Are the cops bad?
[02:37:09.607 --> 02:37:09.987]  No!
[02:37:09.987 --> 02:37:11.608]  They got five of the six.
[02:37:11.608 --> 02:37:15.030]  One of the tips they got was wrong, it's the wrong house, sorry.
[02:37:15.030 --> 02:37:19.373]  It's the same thing, but it's not like I went to a wrong house on purpose.
[02:37:19.373 --> 02:37:20.834]  I didn't go to the house.
[02:37:20.834 --> 02:37:28.939]  CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, they all, Fox was involved in this, Megyn Kelly, pointed at that pizza place,
[02:37:29.679 --> 02:37:35.123]  Which did have creepy art, and the pedestrians did go there, but no, there's not dungeons, blah, blah, blah.
[02:37:35.123 --> 02:37:37.665]  I don't think Alifanis is in there doing things.
[02:37:37.665 --> 02:37:49.793]  So it turns into the media making it about Alifanis, which is then projected onto me, and the media says that I'm the one that's done all this to these innocent people, blah, blah, blah, and then it becomes I'm the abuser of children.
[02:37:49.793 --> 02:37:55.317]  That's the alchemy of this thing, and that's when I said, you're not doing that.
[02:37:55.317 --> 02:37:58.599]  I'm on record exposing pedophilia and the UN and the globalists.
[02:38:00.700 --> 02:38:07.844]  And all the confirmed cases of it, by the millions of kids, and radical Islam being obsessed with pedophilia, don't you try that with me.
[02:38:07.844 --> 02:38:12.307]  And it's the same thing with Sandy Hook, but just, where do you think we should go with this?
[02:38:12.307 --> 02:38:14.449]  How deep does it go?
[02:38:14.449 --> 02:38:19.552]  Why do you think they're trying this big offensive now to bring this out and normalize it?
[02:38:19.552 --> 02:38:25.115]  Well, I think, for personal reasons, obviously, there are higher-ups and powers-be that are pedophiles.
[02:38:25.115 --> 02:38:27.997]  And, you know, and if you're a pedophile,
[02:38:28.866 --> 02:38:46.723]  Or you're getting paid off to support them, or morally you're just, you know, I feel a lot of times the regressive left picks the opposite, whatever we want, no matter how much it makes sense, no matter how much morally it's the upright thing to do, just to be difficult and pick the opposite of what, you know, conservatives and what, really, the average middle America wants.
[02:38:46.723 --> 02:38:48.204]  You know, that's kind of what they do.
[02:38:48.204 --> 02:38:52.328]  They'll put out the facts, they'll find one thing wrong, one thing they didn't turn out wrong,
[02:38:52.688 --> 02:38:55.989]  And boom, they suddenly throw everything out the window like it didn't matter.
[02:38:55.989 --> 02:38:57.130]  That's what Snopes does.
[02:38:57.130 --> 02:38:58.751]  It looks for that one wrong wording.
[02:38:58.751 --> 02:39:00.912]  Oh, false, mostly false.
[02:39:00.912 --> 02:39:03.853]  That doesn't make it false.
[02:39:03.853 --> 02:39:06.514]  The way they do it is in a way to just discredit it.
[02:39:06.514 --> 02:39:10.496]  And people that don't know better will see a headline, will just see the mainstream news.
[02:39:10.496 --> 02:39:13.917]  Most people don't go deep and look further for news and then they believe it.
[02:39:13.917 --> 02:39:16.398]  I think that's how it's gotten this far.
[02:39:16.398 --> 02:39:19.620]  And I honestly think the worst point is NBC yesterday.
[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:23.862]  A whole fluff piece about this wonderful pedo that killed himself.
[02:39:23.862 --> 02:39:27.324]  And I'm sorry, but my fans and most of America is like, and?
[02:39:27.324 --> 02:39:29.886]  We really just don't care.
[02:39:29.886 --> 02:39:32.207]  And that's kind of like the trash taking itself out.
[02:39:32.207 --> 02:39:40.813]  And so I feel like they're going to continue to block and censor and ban everyone that speaks, you know, against pedophiles.
[02:39:40.813 --> 02:39:44.195]  They're going to continue to get paid off and mislead people.
[02:39:44.195 --> 02:39:46.236]  And I think the only way we really can fight it
[02:39:47.142 --> 02:39:50.503]  Is if the average American and we cross party lines.
[02:39:50.503 --> 02:40:01.885]  We have classic liberals and people that want to do the right thing also have to speak up and say it's right and say, look, I know you voted Trump and you probably hate me, but, you know, this is children and we need to step up and do the right thing.
[02:40:01.885 --> 02:40:08.226]  Even if it means my crazy leftist friends are going to be angry and all this stuff and deal with all the things that, you know, we've been dealing with anyway.
[02:40:08.226 --> 02:40:12.807]  I think we have to cross party lines and kind of unite and say, we're not going to stand for this.
[02:40:12.807 --> 02:40:15.988]  I don't care how much you shove it down our throat.
[02:40:16.468 --> 02:40:17.589]  I'm not going to accept this.
[02:40:17.589 --> 02:40:19.411]  I don't care what you ban me on.
[02:40:19.411 --> 02:40:21.133]  And I think that's how most people feel.
[02:40:21.133 --> 02:40:23.316]  We're not going to take this laying down, and I'm not going to forget.
[02:40:23.316 --> 02:40:25.378]  It's been six months since I've uncovered this.
[02:40:25.378 --> 02:40:26.179]  I'm not going to forget.
[02:40:26.179 --> 02:40:34.228]  I'm just going to get more information, and I'm going to find more people, and I'm going to start tracking who's supporting them, who's getting money, who's hiding it, who's doing this stuff.
[02:40:34.228 --> 02:40:36.049]  I want to follow the trail, and I'm not going to lie.
[02:40:36.791 --> 02:40:37.652]  I've gotten some lists.
[02:40:37.652 --> 02:40:38.654]  I was in the first article.
[02:40:38.654 --> 02:40:43.304]  There's 300 profiles of people in a pedophile chat room exchanging information.
[02:40:43.304 --> 02:40:46.871]  How easy would it be for people to just go in there and find out who they really are?
[02:40:46.871 --> 02:40:47.894]  And I bet you'd be surprised!
[02:40:48.809 --> 02:40:49.490]  And who they are.
[02:40:49.490 --> 02:40:55.876]  I wouldn't be surprised if there's an actor, a director in there, or someone, a kindergarten teacher or something.
[02:40:55.876 --> 02:40:59.480]  I think we need to hack their stuff, basically.
[02:40:59.480 --> 02:41:02.443]  Oh, let me tell you, I was contacted... These people are falling behind.
[02:41:02.443 --> 02:41:07.668]  I've been contacted by quite a few gay men, some of them are prominent, and these are off-the-record discussions.
[02:41:07.668 --> 02:41:08.649]  We're going to come back and talk about this.
[02:41:08.649 --> 02:41:12.032]  I was going to let you go now, but I want to talk to you a little bit more because I've got an important question to raise for you.
[02:41:12.873 --> 02:41:18.331]  I've been contacted by people and they'll say I probably wouldn't be, quote, gay if I wasn't molested when I was 10 years old, they say.
[02:41:19.056 --> 02:41:44.293]  But they say, listen, regardless, I love everybody, but they're definitely targeting kids, and then they've gone out and contacted a lot of these prominent people, and they contact them back, and they have discussions and debates, and then these prominent people say, oh yeah, I wish I could have sex with kids, that's really what I want, or oh, I have, because a lot of them were abused as kids, they think that's normal, so they kind of pass on the evil, and then I told these people, just go to law enforcement.
[02:41:44.733 --> 02:41:52.803]  Because this is so prevalent and then I was also given information about a lot of the sex ed teachers don't even hide it.
[02:41:52.803 --> 02:41:58.110]  They put the Nambla symbols and things up behind in the elementary school classes.
[02:41:58.110 --> 02:41:59.211]  They now do it in elementary.
[02:42:00.051 --> 02:42:05.135]  And they're indoctrinating the kids into porn's okay, but just some of it.
[02:42:05.135 --> 02:42:06.596]  And we're going to manage it.
[02:42:06.596 --> 02:42:09.518]  And they even watch blurred out porn in the classes.
[02:42:09.518 --> 02:42:13.701]  And then you look at what they've got and don't show anything.
[02:42:13.701 --> 02:42:15.243]  People can look for themselves.
[02:42:15.243 --> 02:42:17.044]  And it says, I love pizza.
[02:42:17.044 --> 02:42:18.465]  And the guy's got a pit on his shirt.
[02:42:18.465 --> 02:42:19.346]  I love pizza.
[02:42:19.346 --> 02:42:21.227]  And it says pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza.
[02:42:21.227 --> 02:42:22.928]  And they liken sex to pizza.
[02:42:23.769 --> 02:42:31.354]  And this is a national curriculum around the country from Pennsylvania to New York to California.
[02:42:31.354 --> 02:42:32.495]  Folks, investigate it for yourselves.
[02:42:32.495 --> 02:42:34.136]  I'm not going to go there.
[02:42:34.136 --> 02:42:36.718]  I'm not going to get sued out of oblivion for taking the first hit.
[02:42:36.718 --> 02:42:39.439]  But we know who they are.
[02:42:39.439 --> 02:42:44.623]  And I'm going to give them a little bit of a heads up because they're so arrogant they can't stop.
[02:42:44.623 --> 02:42:46.344]  I'm going to use the money I've got left.
[02:42:47.830 --> 02:42:49.333]  So we're gonna put P.I.s on their ass.
[02:42:49.333 --> 02:42:51.178]  I'm letting them know we're coming.
[02:42:51.178 --> 02:42:52.841]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:42:52.841 --> 02:42:54.204]  Now if that doesn't get me killed, nothing will.
[02:43:00.330 --> 02:43:02.672]  The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:43:54.929 --> 02:44:04.199]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:44:04.199 --> 02:44:07.082]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[02:44:07.082 --> 02:44:13.128]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:44:13.789 --> 02:44:20.054]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:44:20.054 --> 02:44:26.340]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[02:44:26.340 --> 02:44:33.385]  Now, due to the Establisher trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[02:44:33.385 --> 02:44:33.585]  But!
[02:44:34.426 --> 02:44:47.452]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:44:47.452 --> 02:44:51.694]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[02:44:51.694 --> 02:44:56.036]  X3, now available at mfulworthslife.com.

[02:45:55.962 --> 02:46:02.007]  Our grandparents and great-grandparents knew that they canned food during the fall so you have it during the winter.
[02:46:02.007 --> 02:46:04.910]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:46:04.910 --> 02:46:08.973]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patriot Supply.

[02:46:59.261 --> 02:47:08.465]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:08.465 --> 02:47:12.527]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[02:47:12.527 --> 02:47:17.910]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:17.910 --> 02:47:20.511]  Shuffle the little children unto me.
[02:47:20.511 --> 02:47:26.734]  It would be better for you to tie a millstone around your neck, a giant boulder, and throw yourself in the deepest sea than to hurt one of these.
[02:47:28.177 --> 02:47:34.725]  The religion of the globalists is ancient.
[02:47:34.725 --> 02:47:37.468]  It is the abuse of the life force energy of children.
[02:47:38.900 --> 02:47:50.403]  You always know, in Bram Stoker's Count Dracula, or in the movies I've read about it, what does he bring to his new brides, but a baby he's kidnapped, so they can all bite into the baby and get the innocence.
[02:47:50.403 --> 02:48:04.307]  Well now, out of China and other areas, they just melt down the baby's collagen, and take the baby blood, and then the rich women take the injections into their veins, and they eat the capsules into their stomachs, and they inject the collagen into their faces.
[02:48:05.759 --> 02:48:07.340]  And it's all over the news.
[02:48:07.340 --> 02:48:10.243]  Told you about it a decade ago, now it's all over the news.
[02:48:10.243 --> 02:48:15.748]  I remember at Bilderberg once I talked about china cots selling dead babies wrapped in gold foil.
[02:48:15.748 --> 02:48:23.835]  And Glenn Beck made a big joke out of it.
[02:48:23.835 --> 02:48:26.697]  Well, I'm not going to be part of the ultimate sin.
[02:48:26.697 --> 02:48:31.682]  Oh, remember Chris Hansen had the number one TV show for a while, and he would show these Shekhos
[02:48:33.001 --> 02:48:39.788]  I thought they were having sex with 12-year-old girls, 13-year-old girls, showing up with a bag of Skittles and Capri Sun or whatever.
[02:48:43.663 --> 02:48:50.165]  They got rid of Chris Hansen and acted like, well, look, he was a hypocrite for an extramarital affair!
[02:48:50.165 --> 02:48:56.668]  Well, I didn't know he was a Puritan, so his crime was he was having sex with another woman and got a divorce.
[02:48:56.668 --> 02:48:58.428]  Wow!
[02:48:58.428 --> 02:49:03.670]  That's totally consensual and not saying it's a good thing to do, but it's not pedophilia.
[02:49:03.670 --> 02:49:11.453]  So see, there's also what our guest Mindy Robinson, investigative journalist, reporter, and of course, successful actress, previous to that and ongoing,
[02:49:12.435 --> 02:49:23.179]  Which is raising how, I'll see in the news, law enforcement continues, both federal and state, to do stings on what they claim is a pedophilia and child porn epidemic.
[02:49:23.179 --> 02:49:24.680]  But there's no proof of it.
[02:49:24.680 --> 02:49:28.201]  It's like saying, there's no proof the sun came up this morning.
[02:49:28.201 --> 02:49:35.884]  So you see this incredible reflexive defense and attempt to stop the investigations when
[02:49:37.071 --> 02:49:43.615]  Man, the pedophilia all over the world, and killing children, and exporting them, and women, is epidemic!
[02:49:43.615 --> 02:49:51.240]  And then to have them deny it, Mindy, is just... It really shows they're signing on to it, or the pedophiles have so much money, they're paying for this coverage.
[02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:52.041]  What do you think's going on?
[02:49:52.930 --> 02:49:54.912]  Both.
[02:49:54.912 --> 02:49:55.993]  I have proof.
[02:49:55.993 --> 02:49:57.614]  I mean, I don't know much further proof.
[02:49:57.614 --> 02:49:59.276]  I think I loved Catch a Predator.
[02:49:59.276 --> 02:50:09.344]  It was a messed up show, but it opened your eyes at how more vigilant we had to be, how laws have not caught up to technology and what happens online.
[02:50:09.344 --> 02:50:10.185]  You know what I mean?
[02:50:10.185 --> 02:50:12.047]  I'm an adult and I see what I get sent.
[02:50:12.427 --> 02:50:14.868]  You know, lewd pictures, hardcore porn.
[02:50:14.868 --> 02:50:15.868]  Like, I could have been a 10-year-old.
[02:50:15.868 --> 02:50:16.889]  They don't care.
[02:50:16.889 --> 02:50:21.630]  Laws have not caught up to technology, and I think regressive leftists have taken over that.
[02:50:21.630 --> 02:50:22.630]  I love to catch a predator.
[02:50:22.630 --> 02:50:26.151]  It made everyone a little bit more careful, you know?
[02:50:26.151 --> 02:50:30.913]  And we were catching people, and we were outing them, and we were shaming them, and we were stigmatizing them.
[02:50:30.913 --> 02:50:32.614]  And that is everything the left wants to get rid of.
[02:50:32.614 --> 02:50:33.634]  They want it to be normal.
[02:50:33.634 --> 02:50:35.715]  They don't want to have a stigma with it.
[02:50:35.715 --> 02:50:37.595]  There's a reason there's supposed to be a stigma.
[02:50:37.595 --> 02:50:39.816]  You ruin a kid's life, you start doing this stuff.
[02:50:40.336 --> 02:50:44.719]  You know, and then they're all across the board from, you know, believing that children can consent.
[02:50:44.719 --> 02:50:46.180]  They really want to push for that.
[02:50:46.180 --> 02:50:49.763]  They believe if a child enjoys it, it's not abuse.
[02:50:49.763 --> 02:50:53.145]  How could it be abuse if the child doesn't know what it wants?
[02:50:53.145 --> 02:50:55.427]  I mean, growing up is confusing enough.
[02:50:55.427 --> 02:51:00.030]  They're just making it worse between the sexualizing of drag queens and all this other stuff.
[02:51:00.030 --> 02:51:02.432]  We're definitely at a battle here.
[02:51:02.432 --> 02:51:03.833]  And I think it's a bit of both.
[02:51:03.833 --> 02:51:04.754]  And I think anyone
[02:51:05.254 --> 02:51:10.917]  Looking the other way, I think a lot of mainstream media execs and CEOs, and how many of them are really owned by Saudis now?
[02:51:10.917 --> 02:51:13.739]  The second largest shareholder of Twitter is a Saudi prince.
[02:51:13.739 --> 02:51:18.162]  You know, you mean to tell me that that doesn't affect what they censor?
[02:51:18.162 --> 02:51:18.802]  No, it does.
[02:51:18.802 --> 02:51:22.504]  It absolutely does affect what they censor, and I can see it, and I can prove it.
[02:51:22.504 --> 02:51:28.348]  All I need is an outlet to say, please, normal people, look at this proof, and let's do something about it.
[02:51:28.348 --> 02:51:33.811]  It's just real hard to do because all of mainstream media is obviously on their side.
[02:51:36.124 --> 02:51:45.748]  Well, you know, sitting back looking at this at a gut level, a spiritual level, Mindy, I've never seen people's instincts come in harder, especially women's all over.
[02:51:45.748 --> 02:51:52.671]  And they're digging into the pedophile stuff and they're like, oh, my God, they're doing drag taught videos at the elementary school.
[02:51:52.671 --> 02:51:54.992]  Oh, my God, they're sending in these men with
[02:51:56.132 --> 02:52:00.198]  Big fat men in purple wigs to tell my kids they might be another sex.
[02:52:00.198 --> 02:52:05.404]  If a fat guy in a purple wig showed up at the park to tell your daughter or son about sex, they'd get arrested.
[02:52:05.404 --> 02:52:09.951]  So how in the hell is it okay if it's sanctioned because the state's involved?
[02:52:09.951 --> 02:52:13.696]  And we need lawsuits, and we need aggressive legal action against this now.
[02:52:15.265 --> 02:52:21.067]  I think we need to purge our entire educational system from college all the way down.
[02:52:21.067 --> 02:52:21.707]  You know what I mean?
[02:52:21.707 --> 02:52:27.769]  I think it started, we were laughing about Common Core Math and how dumb it was, but it goes obviously a lot further than that.
[02:52:27.769 --> 02:52:28.810]  School should be school.
[02:52:28.810 --> 02:52:32.171]  You should be learning about facts and stuff you can prove.
[02:52:32.171 --> 02:52:32.951]  You start throwing
[02:52:33.631 --> 02:52:34.212]  We're good to go.
[02:52:55.003 --> 02:53:00.245]  I don't want any sex around kids, and all of you are creepy and you ought to be ashamed of yourselves, but they're so arrogant.
[02:53:00.245 --> 02:53:01.925]  Have you seen the city council meetings?
[02:53:01.925 --> 02:53:06.627]  Where the drag queens show up and say, you're going to give me access to your five-year-olds, you monsters!
[02:53:06.627 --> 02:53:10.188]  We're going to groom your kids so they're not bigots like you!
[02:53:10.188 --> 02:53:14.269]  Some dude, he goes, I work at the local gay bar stripping.
[02:53:14.269 --> 02:53:16.570]  I know not to act like that around the kids.
[02:53:16.570 --> 02:53:19.111]  I'm going to groom your kids!
[02:53:19.111 --> 02:53:20.171]  I'm going to groom them!
[02:53:20.171 --> 02:53:20.932]  They're mine!
[02:53:20.932 --> 02:53:21.972]  I'm going to groom them!
[02:53:22.492 --> 02:53:23.853]  Everybody's like, what?
[02:53:23.853 --> 02:53:29.137]  These people are so out of their mind, they don't even know.
[02:53:29.137 --> 02:53:32.480]  What happens in the famous story of Sodom and Gomorrah?
[02:53:32.480 --> 02:53:33.701]  They got a couple angels with them.
[02:53:34.602 --> 02:53:38.124]  They're arguing with Lott saying we're going to destroy the city, whether you believe it happened or not.
[02:53:38.124 --> 02:53:41.286]  Sounds like a nuclear weapon goes off.
[02:53:41.286 --> 02:53:45.348]  And the angels are like, we're going to kill these people that are trying to have sex with us.
[02:53:45.348 --> 02:53:49.411]  And there's this big group of men going, give us those good looking men, we're going to have sex with them.
[02:53:49.411 --> 02:53:52.832]  And I mean, Sodom and Gomorrah, they weren't saying give us your kids.
[02:53:52.832 --> 02:53:54.854]  It was just give us your men.
[02:53:54.854 --> 02:53:56.014]  You say, well, that didn't happen.
[02:53:56.014 --> 02:53:58.656]  Well, now they're coming saying, give us your kids.
[02:53:58.656 --> 02:54:00.137]  We're going to groom them.
[02:54:00.817 --> 02:54:01.838]  Listen, you're amazing.
[02:54:01.838 --> 02:54:03.480]  Mindy Robinson, great work.
[02:54:03.480 --> 02:54:04.541]  We look forward to having you back up.
[02:54:04.541 --> 02:54:08.486]  RedWhite and FU.com, Twitter, Instagram.
[02:54:08.486 --> 02:54:09.246]  I heart Mindy.
[02:54:09.246 --> 02:54:11.529]  God bless you and keep the faith.
[02:54:11.529 --> 02:54:12.910]  Thank you.
[02:54:12.910 --> 02:54:15.073]  Okay, we got Matt Bracken coming up.
[02:54:17.418 --> 02:54:21.539]  And I am about three days behind in promotions here.
[02:54:21.539 --> 02:54:23.219]  That's why you've not really heard any plugging today.
[02:54:23.219 --> 02:54:26.180]  It's because I'm going to catch 22.
[02:54:26.180 --> 02:54:33.762]  The sale of 50 to 75% off storewide free shipping, double Patriot points and a free gift has been fabulously successful.
[02:54:33.762 --> 02:54:36.843]  Except we've done the math.
[02:54:36.843 --> 02:54:37.843]  We sold probably
[02:54:39.127 --> 02:54:44.089]  Three million dollars worth of merchandise the last two months, and we probably made $300,000.
[02:54:44.089 --> 02:54:45.769]  That's how low we sold everything.
[02:54:45.769 --> 02:54:49.511]  But the good news is, not having to pay inventory tax, we probably saved another $400,000.
[02:54:49.511 --> 02:54:54.453]  So this has put us in the black for the next few months.
[02:54:54.453 --> 02:55:06.037]  But no wonder people bought the water filtration, the air filtration, the supplements, all of it, because this really is, by a long, long way, I mean, we're talking order of magnitude, the best show ever had.
[02:55:06.037 --> 02:55:06.717]  So here's the problem.
[02:55:08.254 --> 02:55:09.534]  We're selling out of X2.
[02:55:09.534 --> 02:55:10.755]  We're selling out of X3.
[02:55:10.755 --> 02:55:12.676]  We're selling out of Brain Force Plus.
[02:55:12.676 --> 02:55:18.678]  We're selling out of Lung Cleanse, Winter Sun, Secret 12, Super Female, Super Metal Vitality.
[02:55:18.678 --> 02:55:19.738]  Those are the last runs.
[02:55:19.738 --> 02:55:21.099]  Not because they're not number two best seller.
[02:55:21.099 --> 02:55:21.999]  They are.
[02:55:21.999 --> 02:55:24.520]  We can't get the wild crafted herbs of these types anymore.
[02:55:25.667 --> 02:55:31.132]  Uh, and you can't even get some of the ingredients that are certified organic, so we're just discontinuing that because it's too hard to get.
[02:55:31.132 --> 02:55:33.054]  It's, it's incredible.
[02:55:33.054 --> 02:55:41.722]  So, we would continue to have this deal for a while, but so much has already sold out, like the t-shirts, and at large, and extra large, that we have to end it.
[02:55:41.722 --> 02:55:49.930]  The catch-22 is, I'm so busy, that unless I stay up here till 10 o'clock tonight, we're not even gonna have the new stuff tomorrow.
[02:55:51.226 --> 02:55:55.650]  So I may just not have the specials tomorrow, and then there's no new specials.
[02:55:55.650 --> 02:55:58.572]  So I'm not like saying, this is yesterday, the last day.
[02:55:58.572 --> 02:56:02.415]  And then today it's like, this is the last day.
[02:56:02.415 --> 02:56:03.836]  It's the, here's the deal.
[02:56:03.836 --> 02:56:16.846]  We have three new incredible products, but they're so good, and I'm serious when I say this, that I don't wanna just announce them, and I don't wanna just launch them, and then just kinda let it dissipate.
[02:56:16.846 --> 02:56:20.249]  Because I've launched a lot of products that are amazing, and if I don't make a big deal about them,
[02:56:22.489 --> 02:56:23.630]  They don't.
[02:56:23.630 --> 02:56:24.571]  People don't try them.
[02:56:24.571 --> 02:56:26.212]  They don't see how great they are.
[02:56:26.212 --> 02:56:27.994]  And we have a lot of best sellers.
[02:56:27.994 --> 02:56:30.816]  Either stuff's a best seller or it doesn't sell.
[02:56:30.816 --> 02:56:42.266]  And these three new products are so good that I'm sitting here with so much data, so much evidence of how great this is that I don't know where to start.
[02:56:42.266 --> 02:56:45.949]  And then I've got to get lawyers to approve what I'm going to say.
[02:56:45.949 --> 02:56:48.672]  And they've been standing by for a week and a half.
[02:56:49.710 --> 02:56:51.331]  And I haven't cut the final ads.
[02:56:51.331 --> 02:56:59.758]  So, this is the last day, one way or another, because it's already the last day for most, oh, half our products are already sold out.
[02:56:59.758 --> 02:57:00.679]  So, this is it.
[02:57:00.679 --> 02:57:01.760]  This is the total clearance.
[02:57:01.760 --> 02:57:03.802]  It was successful.
[02:57:03.802 --> 02:57:09.106]  I'm hustling to get more t-shirts in, because you sell more t-shirts in large and extra large than all the others combined.
[02:57:09.106 --> 02:57:11.248]  So, we've got all the other t-shirts the other sizes.
[02:57:11.248 --> 02:57:12.128]  We're just sold out of those.
[02:57:12.128 --> 02:57:16.432]  So, we had to stop giving the free gift of t-shirts, because most of you wanted those.
[02:57:16.432 --> 02:57:18.514]  We have another free gift that's excellent as well.
[02:57:20.031 --> 02:57:26.456]  Point is, this is the biggest sales in our history, and this has got to be the last day.
[02:57:26.456 --> 02:57:28.618]  One way or another, I'm just going to do it.
[02:57:28.618 --> 02:57:30.999]  Here's what I'm going to try to do.
[02:57:30.999 --> 02:57:38.485]  I'm going to come back before Matt Bracken, when we come back in two minutes, and I'm going to do my best to tell you about one of the new products in that little five-minute segment.
[02:57:38.485 --> 02:57:39.786]  I'm going to do my very best.
[02:57:39.786 --> 02:57:40.366]  Please stay with us.
[02:57:40.366 --> 02:57:42.188]  And Matt Bracken's got critical intel.
[02:57:42.188 --> 02:57:43.589]  Without you spreading the word, we're dead meat.
[02:57:45.231 --> 02:57:51.712]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[02:57:51.712 --> 02:57:58.534]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[02:57:58.534 --> 02:58:14.057]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.

[02:58:57.328 --> 02:59:03.890]  Happies is a powerful mood and stress support formula that has your back against life's daily inconveniences.
[02:59:04.110 --> 02:59:04.451]  I think so.
[02:59:21.834 --> 02:59:22.314]  I think so.
[02:59:49.292 --> 02:59:51.899]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:06.713 --> 03:00:07.854]  You found it.
[03:00:07.854 --> 03:00:10.896]  The front lines of the human awakening.
[03:00:10.896 --> 03:00:12.997]  It's the Infowar.
[03:00:12.997 --> 03:00:16.860]  And now, Alex Jones.
[03:00:16.860 --> 03:00:24.444]  Well, by the grace of God, and a lot of luck, and your support, we beat Hillary Clinton.
[03:00:24.444 --> 03:00:28.167]  And I properly gauge that humanity would want freedom worldwide versus globalism.
[03:00:29.760 --> 03:00:40.179]  As arrogant as the corporate press was, the trader press, we just got the word out about globalism versus freedom versus nationalism and renaissance that the world would revolt.
[03:00:40.179 --> 03:00:41.601]  And the new president in Brazil
[03:00:42.765 --> 03:00:46.686]  As delivering in Royals flush right now.
[03:00:46.686 --> 03:00:48.967]  And so is the rest of Eastern Europe.
[03:00:48.967 --> 03:00:49.947]  So is the UK.
[03:00:49.947 --> 03:00:51.428]  So is Russia.
[03:00:51.428 --> 03:00:59.050]  And I'm just proud America is right beside that big, fat, juicy renaissance that South Korea, Japan, many others are involved in.
[03:00:59.050 --> 03:01:00.110]  Some areas of the Middle East.
[03:01:00.110 --> 03:01:02.251]  There was a big renaissance coming in the Middle East.
[03:01:02.251 --> 03:01:05.132]  That's when the globalists set loose seven years ago, the Arab Spring.
[03:01:06.633 --> 03:01:18.702]  Now that said, Matt Brackett's coming up with a lot of key intel in the next hour, former Navy SEAL best-selling author, but we're gonna launch in the next few weeks three new products.
[03:01:18.702 --> 03:01:26.168]  Now, these three new products are sponsor-driven, because you know they're trying to take our payment processing away.
[03:01:26.168 --> 03:01:28.170]  They're trying to shut us down, George Soros says.
[03:01:28.170 --> 03:01:29.071]  Now, they failed.
[03:01:29.071 --> 03:01:30.051]  They took five of our six.
[03:01:30.051 --> 03:01:34.014]  We got a few backups, got some other things there, but just in case,
[03:01:35.439 --> 03:01:40.463]  I am forging alliances with top companies in the U.S.
[03:01:40.463 --> 03:01:48.230]  that reached out to us, and some that I've known for a long time, who want to sponsor us regardless of what happens.
[03:01:48.230 --> 03:01:49.951]  They're ready for the fight.
[03:01:49.951 --> 03:01:59.359]  I said to these three companies, this goes back months ago when this all started, I said, I don't want you to go through that.
[03:01:59.359 --> 03:02:01.621]  Why should we show our hand?
[03:02:01.621 --> 03:02:03.002]  Let's have our cake and eat it too.
[03:02:03.939 --> 03:02:07.981]  With the audience, we'll private label your best selling products.
[03:02:07.981 --> 03:02:13.163]  And then that way everybody gets the best price.
[03:02:13.163 --> 03:02:20.186]  They get it from you, you drop ship it, you handle it under a new company name, whole new deal.
[03:02:20.186 --> 03:02:26.228]  And then George Soros has a lot more trouble coming after you with the different criminal organizations he runs.
[03:02:26.228 --> 03:02:28.149]  And I said, okay, then yeah, we'll do that.
[03:02:28.149 --> 03:02:30.610]  Well, we've done it.
[03:02:30.610 --> 03:02:31.911]  We've built three new websites.
[03:02:32.915 --> 03:02:42.817]  Three new companies with these folks, and the first one I'm going to announce here, ladies and gentlemen, is Washington's Reserve.
[03:02:42.817 --> 03:02:46.398]  Washington's with an S, reserve.com.
[03:02:46.398 --> 03:02:50.119]  This is in the top three.
[03:02:50.119 --> 03:02:55.160]  I'm not going to give away too much.
[03:02:55.160 --> 03:03:00.641]  Not just CBD oil, but herbal companies in the nation.
[03:03:00.641 --> 03:03:00.881]  Okay?
[03:03:02.455 --> 03:03:06.498]  And they're in Whole Foods, they're in everything.
[03:03:06.498 --> 03:03:18.667]  And they already put out this CBD enriched extracts from wild organic hemp.
[03:03:18.667 --> 03:03:19.308]  The very best.
[03:03:21.207 --> 03:03:24.750]  They already are one of the main people in the country with this.
[03:03:24.750 --> 03:03:28.393]  And what's great about this is, there's no THC.
[03:03:28.393 --> 03:03:29.494]  Doesn't get you high.
[03:03:29.494 --> 03:03:30.615]  It's legal in all 50 states.
[03:03:30.615 --> 03:03:31.255]  There's no questions.
[03:03:31.255 --> 03:03:32.536]  It's like a lot of this CBD oil.
[03:03:32.536 --> 03:03:34.138]  Gets you locked up.
[03:03:35.219 --> 03:03:36.240]  And it's even as good.
[03:03:36.240 --> 03:03:38.561]  This has all the good, none of the bad.
[03:03:38.561 --> 03:03:42.484]  It's from raw hemp, CBD oil, super strong.
[03:03:42.484 --> 03:03:48.267]  And we've got it from super weak and super inexpensive right up to Godzilla level.
[03:03:48.267 --> 03:03:50.909]  And by Godzilla level, it doesn't get you high.
[03:03:50.909 --> 03:03:56.373]  It makes you, well, knockouts great with valerian root and L-tryptophan and all the rest of it.
[03:03:56.373 --> 03:03:56.793]  It's awesome.
[03:03:58.504 --> 03:03:59.885]  But this is even stronger.
[03:03:59.885 --> 03:04:04.548]  What I've been taking is the Sleep Aid, and my Lord, is it incredible.
[03:04:04.548 --> 03:04:06.549]  And again, you don't feel it when you're on it.
[03:04:06.549 --> 03:04:10.612]  It just... There's no drug in it.
[03:04:10.612 --> 03:04:12.213]  There's nothing that gets you arrested.
[03:04:12.213 --> 03:04:26.862]  It's all what's in the hemp, the George Washington Group, at Mount Vernon, and it's all there, and there's literally more than 30 products on the site, because this is private-labeled, one of the top
[03:04:29.082 --> 03:04:31.083]  They've already given away too much saying top three.
[03:04:31.083 --> 03:04:36.545]  But it's a big company, and they were willing to go to bat with us with a contract, everything, to not knock back down.
[03:04:36.545 --> 03:04:39.827]  I said, listen, let's just have your cake and eat it too.
[03:04:39.827 --> 03:04:43.988]  Just like my pillow is keeping Tucker Carlson on the air, it's the same thing with this.
[03:04:43.988 --> 03:04:47.130]  And it's Washington's reserve.
[03:04:47.130 --> 03:04:51.732]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're ready to ship it to you anywhere in the 50 states or worldwide.
[03:04:51.732 --> 03:04:52.252]  It's amazing.
[03:04:54.508 --> 03:05:01.655]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.
[03:05:01.655 --> 03:05:14.006]  Help the good bacteria thrive and support overall digestive health with our specially formulated Prebiotic Fiber, a mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia, fruit, and flax fiber.
[03:05:14.727 --> 03:05:25.794]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.

[03:05:47.833 --> 03:05:50.516]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[03:06:29.957 --> 03:06:33.737]  Defending this republic against all enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:06:33.737 --> 03:06:38.459]  You know, Matt Bracken's taken over for the hour, former Navy SEAL, best-selling author.
[03:06:38.459 --> 03:06:40.619]  Website, enemiesforeignanddomestic.com.
[03:06:40.619 --> 03:06:43.300]  And I heard him the other day on the radio while I was driving.
[03:06:43.300 --> 03:06:44.020]  I wasn't watching.
[03:06:45.034 --> 03:06:58.579]  And he said, you know, I usually wear this lion necklace, but he said, now I'm going to wear this Vlad Tepes necklace, which I know goes back to the La Reconquista, when they started taking back Spain from the Moors from the North African invasion.
[03:06:59.798 --> 03:07:09.185]  And I'm telling you, I think that is a symbol that I want to use as well, because I don't want the fake symbol of the cross taken over by the fake churches that teaches us to lay down and be slaves.
[03:07:09.185 --> 03:07:11.767]  Christ said, sell your garments and buy swords.
[03:07:11.767 --> 03:07:15.951]  There's a time for Christ to die as a sacrifice for our sins.
[03:07:15.951 --> 03:07:17.452]  But did Moses lay down?
[03:07:17.452 --> 03:07:17.732]  No.
[03:07:17.732 --> 03:07:21.515]  Did the Jews lay down at Masada?
[03:07:21.515 --> 03:07:26.099]  There's also a time to defend yourselves, not offensively, but defensively.
[03:07:26.099 --> 03:07:28.801]  Now once somebody starts a war, everything is defense.
[03:07:29.926 --> 03:07:35.289]  But I do like the Vlad Tepes symbol, and I'm going to get behind it.
[03:07:35.289 --> 03:07:36.810]  And you know what?
[03:07:36.810 --> 03:07:40.892]  I had a whole bunch, maybe 5,000 belt buckles forged.
[03:07:40.892 --> 03:07:44.514]  They were successful and they were good, but they're so expensive to make.
[03:07:44.514 --> 03:07:48.196]  By the time you make them one for 25 bucks and sell it for 40, you don't really fund yourself.
[03:07:48.196 --> 03:07:49.497]  Hell, I'm wearing one right now.
[03:07:49.497 --> 03:07:51.098]  Well, I mean, I'm wearing my own.
[03:07:51.098 --> 03:07:51.458]  Take it off.
[03:07:54.352 --> 03:07:56.794]  I designed this, baby, years ago.
[03:07:56.794 --> 03:07:58.415]  Veteran-owned group out of Oregon, actually.
[03:07:58.415 --> 03:07:59.656]  I'm going to have them make some more.
[03:07:59.656 --> 03:08:01.257]  I think we have, like, maybe 1,000 of these.
[03:08:01.257 --> 03:08:04.919]  Well, this is one of 500, this limited edition.
[03:08:04.919 --> 03:08:07.561]  It says Molon... Here, let me see the document cam shot.
[03:08:07.561 --> 03:08:09.522]  Molon Labe, Infowars.
[03:08:09.522 --> 03:08:12.985]  By the way, I'm saying this on air that I'm going to get behind the Vlad Tepes movement.
[03:08:14.099 --> 03:08:18.241]  Not because I'm claiming it's mine or a symbol that only I can have.
[03:08:18.241 --> 03:08:21.543]  Anything I talk about like this commercially, there's a run on it.
[03:08:21.543 --> 03:08:25.025]  So I hope everybody starts putting Vlad Tepes stuff out and puts us out of business.
[03:08:25.025 --> 03:08:28.486]  But I am going to put out a Vlad Tepes belt buckle.
[03:08:28.486 --> 03:08:31.988]  That's made in 1776 line right there.
[03:08:31.988 --> 03:08:38.051]  And I'm going to put out a silver necklace.
[03:08:38.051 --> 03:08:39.592]  And then later with that successful a gold one.
[03:08:41.232 --> 03:08:49.718]  Because people want something designer like that, and that's the type of jewelry I would actually wear that actually has a symbol to it, because I'm not a gaudy fellow.
[03:08:49.718 --> 03:09:00.765]  But symbols are everything, and a Christian cross with a dagger in the bottom of it, that is a very, very exciting cross of St.
[03:09:00.765 --> 03:09:01.665]  James.
[03:09:01.665 --> 03:09:05.948]  So I guess Vlad Tepes came up with the idea about it, but he calls it the Vlad Tepes cross.
[03:09:05.948 --> 03:09:08.930]  But regardless, people need symbols, don't they, Matt Bracken?
[03:09:10.174 --> 03:09:19.393]  Definitely, and especially when you're trying to counteract, you know, almost a century of Gramscian and Frankfurt School cultural Marxist brainwashing.
[03:09:20.177 --> 03:09:28.446]  I'm sure it's no coincidence that the translation of thou shalt not murder got changed to the pacifistic thou shalt not kill.
[03:09:28.446 --> 03:09:34.152]  Like, you mean if a home invader is coming in, just let them have your kids because it's thou shalt not kill?
[03:09:34.152 --> 03:09:35.814]  That's a completely false translation.
[03:09:35.814 --> 03:09:40.119]  No, the Hebrew translation is thou shalt not murder, which means go out and just kill an innocent person.
[03:09:40.959 --> 03:09:44.820]  Right, but that doesn't mean no self-defense.
[03:09:44.820 --> 03:09:50.541]  And this is VladTepesBlog.com, the cross.
[03:09:50.541 --> 03:09:53.222]  But there's no copyright on it per se.
[03:09:53.222 --> 03:09:57.743]  He sells them because he's trying to get this idea going and he got the idea to begin it.
[03:09:57.743 --> 03:09:58.983]  No, no, I heard you talking about it.
[03:09:58.983 --> 03:10:01.443]  That's what I'm saying is that we need pure adoption of this.
[03:10:01.443 --> 03:10:03.584]  And it should be clear, it's the cross of St.
[03:10:03.584 --> 03:10:03.844]  James.
[03:10:04.847 --> 03:10:06.508]  That's right, and his name is St.
[03:10:06.508 --> 03:10:10.109]  James Matamoros, which means kill the Moors.
[03:10:10.109 --> 03:10:17.452]  And the cross is usually shown red because his silver sword was covered with the blood of the Moors.
[03:10:17.452 --> 03:10:26.435]  This is attributed to a battle in the middle of the 800s when Spain was pushed up to like a tiny little strip along the northern coast.
[03:10:27.308 --> 03:10:55.249]  And from there, where they were being constantly, practically exterminated, or made extinct in Spain as free Christian Spanish, King Ramiro, there was an annual tribute of a hundred maidens, and he finally said, no, we're not going to pay the hundred maidens tribute from our province, and prayed, and according to, whether you want to call it a miracle, or a myth, or a legend, Saint James the Apostle,
[03:10:56.278 --> 03:11:02.065]  appeared in Spain on this horse and just started wiping out Moors.
[03:11:02.065 --> 03:11:12.518]  And it still took 700 years, but that cross became the symbol of the fighting Christians that weren't just going to commit suicide by pacifism.
[03:11:12.518 --> 03:11:13.760]  Let me throw this out about the cross of St.
[03:11:13.760 --> 03:11:14.040]  James.
[03:11:15.061 --> 03:11:27.877]  I was the last few days before that and with my crew thinking we need a new symbol for the Infowar and I want it to be something that's a cross but I don't want it to be associated with the establishment evil synthetic Christianity.
[03:11:27.877 --> 03:11:33.303]  I want it to be about the defense of Christendom and the defense of the West and then as sure as
[03:11:34.284 --> 03:11:34.984]  The sun came up.
[03:11:34.984 --> 03:11:35.565]  Was it Monday?
[03:11:35.565 --> 03:11:36.545]  Was it last Friday?
[03:11:36.545 --> 03:11:38.347]  What day was it you last hosted?
[03:11:38.347 --> 03:11:38.727]  Friday.
[03:11:38.727 --> 03:11:44.551]  So it was last Friday, I'm in my car to take care of some errands, and I hear you talking about that cross of St.
[03:11:44.551 --> 03:12:01.562]  James, and I already knew that cross, and I went, oh my God, next time I talk to Matt Bracken, that's the symbol that InfoWars is going to adopt, because I already knew the symbol, I've been to Spain, I know the history of it, I know that, like you said, 500 to 700 years of La Reconquista, millions dead,
[03:12:02.402 --> 03:12:03.823]  I'm telling you, this is a gift from God.
[03:12:32.182 --> 03:12:40.833]  Yeah, I'm actually, I'm really promoting this for patches, you know, what they call morale patches.
[03:12:40.833 --> 03:12:48.922]  There's a company called 144.1, which is a psalm about the Lord teaching my hands to prepare for war.
[03:12:49.583 --> 03:12:53.364]  So it's actually in the Bible, Psalm 144.
[03:12:53.364 --> 03:12:58.586]  They have a website where they sell what they call morale patches, and they're going to start making these also.
[03:12:58.586 --> 03:13:03.027]  This is, you know, different, you know, Gadsden symbols, things like that.
[03:13:03.027 --> 03:13:04.927]  This needs to join the Gadsden.
[03:13:04.927 --> 03:13:09.128]  This needs to join the 1776, the 3%, because it's older than all that.
[03:13:09.128 --> 03:13:11.009]  And if it wasn't for this, we wouldn't be here.
[03:13:12.051 --> 03:13:12.571]  That's right.
[03:13:12.571 --> 03:13:15.854]  And it's going to take a real shift in the mentality.
[03:13:15.854 --> 03:13:30.763]  And I welcome the opportunity to debate, because anybody who reflexively, you know, brainwashed pacifists, who reflexively say, but Jesus said turn the other cheek, well, no, Jesus never said commit suicide through pacifism.
[03:13:30.763 --> 03:13:32.184]  And it wasn't until Christians... Well, there's a good quote.
[03:13:32.184 --> 03:13:33.665]  Let's go back to that quote since you mentioned it.
[03:13:33.665 --> 03:13:34.986]  That's a powerful quote.
[03:13:34.986 --> 03:13:36.367]  Put that quote back up, guys, please.
[03:13:38.416 --> 03:13:39.677]  That's a Psalm of David.
[03:13:39.677 --> 03:13:45.883]  Bless be he the Lord my strength which teaches my hands to war and my fingers to fight.
[03:13:45.883 --> 03:13:47.004]  Right.
[03:13:47.004 --> 03:13:54.131]  Because otherwise you're just going to be wiped out by the next pack of Mongols or Jihadists that comes along.
[03:13:54.944 --> 03:14:01.547]  There are vicious groups out there and their formula is to be so vicious that people will just surrender.
[03:14:01.547 --> 03:14:06.188]  The Mongols and the Jihadists use the same exact formula.
[03:14:06.188 --> 03:14:09.790]  When they would approach a walled city, they would send out an emissary and they would say,
[03:14:10.570 --> 03:14:19.617]  If you surrender, and you agree to pay the tribute, and do whatever we say, you know, send us women, feed our armies, then we won't massacre you.
[03:14:19.617 --> 03:14:25.501]  But if you resist, we're going to massacre your men, enslave your women and children.
[03:14:25.501 --> 03:14:26.442]  And they would do it.
[03:14:26.442 --> 03:14:30.805]  So it was the Mongol formula, and then later it was Muhammad's formula.
[03:14:30.805 --> 03:14:33.127]  And you know what's really fascinating to me?
[03:14:33.127 --> 03:14:36.970]  Where these two battle strategies met was in the Crimea.
[03:14:37.660 --> 03:14:38.920]  And guess what?
[03:14:38.920 --> 03:14:43.002]  The Mongol, the Crimean Tatars became Muslims.
[03:14:43.002 --> 03:14:51.504]  So, when it came to out-brutalizing one another, the Mohammedans out-brutalized the Mongol horde, the Tatars.
[03:14:51.504 --> 03:14:54.265]  So, the Tatars didn't defeat the Mohammedans.
[03:14:54.265 --> 03:15:00.627]  The Mohammedans, the Tatars came into that region, but a century later, guess what?
[03:15:00.627 --> 03:15:01.467]  They were all Islamic.
[03:15:02.435 --> 03:15:09.981]  So, I mean, you know, you can't throw rose petals at jihadists or win them over with poetry verses.
[03:15:09.981 --> 03:15:12.443]  And then we have Albania invading Serbia.
[03:15:12.443 --> 03:15:16.806]  They even, in the midst of the war, in our media, said Serbia is to blame for defending itself.
[03:15:16.806 --> 03:15:21.009]  Thank God Russia went into pristina and didn't let them take the whole damn country.
[03:15:22.156 --> 03:15:24.319]  Yeah, that's a whole other issue.
[03:15:24.319 --> 03:15:38.358]  It's easy for people in Holland or Sweden to virtue signal, but when you're a Serb and you've been living literally in the trenches for hundreds of years, the only way you're not going to be Islamified is by becoming a tough son of a bitch.
[03:15:39.773 --> 03:15:41.655]  Well, they come to kill you, you're gonna have to kill.
[03:15:41.655 --> 03:15:44.017]  And I'm sorry I tried to stop all this.
[03:15:44.017 --> 03:15:48.362]  I tried to stop the destabilizing the Middle East and breaking the borders, but the globalists succeeded.
[03:15:48.362 --> 03:15:50.885]  So now, we have to prepare for war.
[03:15:50.885 --> 03:15:51.846]  Matt Bracken takes over.

[03:16:53.044 --> 03:16:54.285]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:16:54.285 --> 03:16:58.206]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:16:58.206 --> 03:16:59.747]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:16:59.747 --> 03:17:02.708]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:02.708 --> 03:17:08.251]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[03:19:02.441 --> 03:19:03.903]  Believe me, I know.
[03:19:03.903 --> 03:19:08.629]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:19:08.629 --> 03:19:13.615]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[03:19:13.835 --> 03:19:33.998]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[03:19:56.751 --> 03:19:59.393]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:15.094 --> 03:20:21.918]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:21.918 --> 03:20:28.142]  And now, your host, Matt Bracken.
[03:20:28.142 --> 03:20:36.327]  Okay, it's good to be back, and I find it really amazing that Alex heard that episode last Friday when I was talking about the St.
[03:20:36.327 --> 03:20:37.027]  James Cross.
[03:20:37.027 --> 03:20:40.469]  It's this symbol, for anybody that missed the last segment.
[03:20:41.500 --> 03:20:46.503]  It's the symbol of Christians that are going to fight back and resist with force of arms.
[03:20:46.503 --> 03:20:49.625]  And anyway, look for that one.
[03:20:49.625 --> 03:20:52.407]  Hats, patches, stickers, etc.
[03:20:52.407 --> 03:20:54.769]  going forward as you can see I'm wearing one right now.
[03:20:55.620 --> 03:21:03.364]  Now, in this first segment, I've got a little talk to give, but after that, we're going to take some calls.
[03:21:03.364 --> 03:21:04.724]  And the call-in number is 877-789-2539.
[03:21:04.724 --> 03:21:05.305]  That's 877-789-ALEX.
[03:21:05.305 --> 03:21:08.486]  And we'll be taking calls in the next segments after this.
[03:21:17.873 --> 03:21:21.575]  So I'm not sure if I'm going to start doing podcasts.
[03:21:21.575 --> 03:21:28.360]  People are asking if I'm going to, or making my own videos.
[03:21:28.360 --> 03:21:30.121]  There are so many great ones out there.
[03:21:30.121 --> 03:21:34.904]  I always look for Black Pigeon Speaks, Iconoclast.
[03:21:34.904 --> 03:21:38.686]  There's a lot that are really worth watching, in my opinion.
[03:21:38.686 --> 03:21:39.907]  Too many to list here.
[03:21:39.907 --> 03:21:41.788]  Those are two of my favorites.
[03:21:41.788 --> 03:21:47.192]  And I don't know if I can even get into their league, but I do occasionally write some stuff
[03:21:48.050 --> 03:21:58.578]  And in fact, you know, besides novels, I have a lot of short works, and I'm putting together a printed version of my anthology now that's updated with my newer stuff up to this past year.
[03:21:58.578 --> 03:22:02.301]  Now, this is one that I haven't written.
[03:22:02.301 --> 03:22:09.507]  It's not in any book or essay yet, but I call this Rules for Deep State Overlords.
[03:22:10.575 --> 03:22:23.947]  And this is basically the handbook for how to take over a country and then maintain your own power against the will of the people in the modern era.
[03:22:23.947 --> 03:22:25.809]  And I'm going to go through these.
[03:22:25.809 --> 03:22:27.591]  They're numbered.
[03:22:27.591 --> 03:22:33.236]  I might write an essay or do a video, but you can help me out if you think I missed anything here.
[03:22:34.602 --> 03:22:43.830]  Number one is maybe the stickiest and the hardest and it's unique to the United States and only a few other countries because it's pretty hard to accomplish this.
[03:22:43.830 --> 03:22:49.154]  Rule number one is disarm the population in the name of public safety.
[03:22:49.154 --> 03:22:55.720]  This is almost in every case a mandatory requirement of a deep state tyranny.
[03:22:55.720 --> 03:22:57.882]  You have to disarm the peasants.
[03:22:57.882 --> 03:23:01.745]  Even in Venezuela they did it a year or two before they really put on the screws.
[03:23:03.306 --> 03:23:12.593]  Every country from Armenia to Germany in the 30s, the Armenians were wiped out after they were disarmed.
[03:23:12.593 --> 03:23:15.095]  The reason given was public safety.
[03:23:15.095 --> 03:23:20.378]  The problem in the United States for the deep state overlords is the Constitution.
[03:23:20.378 --> 03:23:21.699]  It's in the Constitution.
[03:23:21.699 --> 03:23:27.964]  So they've got to find workarounds and that generally involves putting corrupt judges into positions of power.
[03:23:30.104 --> 03:23:37.772]  Number two on the list is you have to make sure that your police especially and the military have their own separate
[03:23:38.436 --> 03:23:43.139]  Pay channels, housing, access to food.
[03:23:43.139 --> 03:23:58.907]  So even if the supermarkets are being looted, even if the ATMs aren't working, you have to make sure that your police and your military are going to get paid, they'll feel secure, and then they'll be willing to go out and crack heads among the rabble outside of the bases.
[03:24:02.089 --> 03:24:05.172]  But they need to have their own supply lines.
[03:24:05.172 --> 03:24:08.834]  That's pretty much accomplished already in most modern countries.
[03:24:08.834 --> 03:24:10.556]  That's no problem.
[03:24:10.556 --> 03:24:18.862]  Now, then you need to, you need to stealthily recruit a permanent voting block of useful idiots.
[03:24:18.862 --> 03:24:22.385]  And you do this by promising them free stuff.
[03:24:22.385 --> 03:24:25.247]  And how do you recruit a moron?
[03:24:25.247 --> 03:24:27.369]  You promise them a free lunch.
[03:24:27.369 --> 03:24:29.471]  By definition, there's no such thing.
[03:24:29.471 --> 03:24:30.892]  But morons don't know that.
[03:24:31.661 --> 03:24:35.644]  This ties in with something called the Dunning-Kruger effect.
[03:24:35.644 --> 03:24:46.492]  The Dunning-Kruger effect is a psychological paradigm where people who are really dumb are too dumb to know how dumb they are, and they think they're actually smart.
[03:24:46.492 --> 03:24:58.902]  So when an Ocasio-Cortez comes along and says, we're going to have a green revolution and give everybody everything for free, and we're not going to listen to those mean Republicans, these dummies actually believe it.
[03:24:59.517 --> 03:25:04.762]  So the Democrats are recruiting Dunning-Kruger Democrats.
[03:25:04.762 --> 03:25:14.090]  She's a Dunning-Kruger leader, recruiting more Dunning-Kruger-Lemmings, and preferably these candidates should be as dumb as possible.
[03:25:14.090 --> 03:25:18.233]  If they're illiterate and don't speak English, that's even better.
[03:25:18.233 --> 03:25:24.879]  If they have special needs, better still, because they'll require tons of government workers to take care of and nurture them.
[03:25:27.684 --> 03:25:35.529]  The next step is promote conditions of violence, criminality, and anarchy.
[03:25:35.529 --> 03:25:47.155]  A writer named Sam Francis wrote about this in 2004 in an article called Anarcho-Tyranny Where Multiculturalism Leads.
[03:25:48.711 --> 03:25:52.153]  It's not an accident that Venezuela looks like it does.
[03:25:52.153 --> 03:26:11.568]  Under conditions of anarcho-tyranny, the government has all the justification that it needs to establish a permanent state of emergency, you know, with anti-terrorism laws, special police powers to raid anybody at any time, a cloak of secrecy over top of all of their covert actions.
[03:26:12.308 --> 03:26:18.893]  So, it's not an accident that they jam hostile ethnic and religious groups together.
[03:26:18.893 --> 03:26:24.497]  It's not like they didn't realize this would result in a social catastrophe.
[03:26:24.497 --> 03:26:32.963]  They understand it, but from their castles on the hill, it actually works to their benefit to have the peasants at each other's throats.
[03:26:32.963 --> 03:26:38.527]  Because then they can use the force of the military to crack down on any of their enemies.
[03:26:38.527 --> 03:26:41.569]  So you look at a country like, you look at Germany, Britain, France,
[03:26:42.259 --> 03:26:47.262]  They're actually arresting people for mean social media comments.
[03:26:47.262 --> 03:26:53.246]  So they under the rubric of we got to stop terrorism, they don't actually stop the jihad invasion.
[03:26:53.246 --> 03:26:56.948]  What they do is they stop people from complaining about it.
[03:26:56.948 --> 03:27:01.691]  So next, number four, you can use algorithms
[03:27:03.317 --> 03:27:03.417]  Yeah.
[03:27:17.373 --> 03:27:19.194]  Or the potential rivals.
[03:27:19.194 --> 03:27:25.217]  Effective resistors and potential rivals are the biggest danger to the overlords.
[03:27:25.217 --> 03:27:33.261]  The average person will put up with almost any amount of deprivation as long as they're not absolutely starving.
[03:27:33.261 --> 03:27:38.904]  But it's those pesky resistors that have to be dealt with.
[03:27:39.651 --> 03:27:41.692]  Because they can gain a following.
[03:27:41.692 --> 03:27:45.275]  They can actually, you know, get a lot of people to follow them.
[03:27:45.275 --> 03:27:57.143]  Fortunately for the deep state overlords, they can just piggyback on top of social media so their stooges at Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google can do the heavy lifting for them.
[03:27:57.803 --> 03:28:14.427]  And then the deep state overlords can just piggyback on top of that and put their thumb on the scale where necessary to make sure that troublesome, pesky gadflies, the effective resistors, the potential rivals, are throttled and have their volume turned way, way down.
[03:28:15.314 --> 03:28:20.556]  So that's got us up to number four now on the rules for deep state overlords.
[03:28:20.556 --> 03:28:24.738]  And I'm going to come back after this break and we're going to go through the rest of them.
[03:28:24.738 --> 03:28:40.184]  And I hope you find this interesting and informative because we are being played and it's up to us to figure out how to be effective resistors and how to actually, you know, not get our volume throttled down to where we have no impact.
[03:28:41.050 --> 03:28:44.834]  I'm doing pretty well getting on Alex Jones Show, I'll tell you what.

[03:31:53.650 --> 03:32:02.961]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[03:32:02.961 --> 03:32:05.824]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:32:05.824 --> 03:32:11.871]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:32:12.532 --> 03:32:18.796]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:32:18.796 --> 03:32:25.079]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:32:25.079 --> 03:32:32.023]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:32:33.164 --> 03:32:46.195]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:32:46.195 --> 03:32:50.439]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:32:50.439 --> 03:32:57.745]  X3, now available at mfulworthslife.com.
[03:32:57.745 --> 03:33:00.388]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.426 --> 03:33:21.988]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:21.988 --> 03:33:24.588]  It's Matt Bracken.
[03:33:24.588 --> 03:33:30.470]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:30.470 --> 03:33:35.271]  Okay, during the next segment, we'll take some phone calls at 877-789-2539.
[03:33:35.271 --> 03:33:35.731]  That's 789-ALEX.
[03:33:42.918 --> 03:33:47.960]  But I want to finish up my rules for deep state overlords.
[03:33:47.960 --> 03:33:58.323]  We got through number four, which was use algorithms and data mining and social media to, in a private way, sort of do what China's doing with the social credit system.
[03:33:58.323 --> 03:34:10.827]  It's not such a blunt instrument here yet that you can't get on a train, but they can certainly take away your Patreon account or make it impossible for you to use credit cards like they have done to some conservatives.
[03:34:11.511 --> 03:34:21.617]  Just because they get brigaded, which means the liberals gang up on somebody and put in a ton of complaints saying that so-and-so is a hater, or a Nazi, or a racist.
[03:34:21.617 --> 03:34:23.658]  The next thing you know, you're an un-person.
[03:34:23.658 --> 03:34:27.901]  So that's how they do it in the land of the free, as opposed to Communist China.
[03:34:27.901 --> 03:34:37.547]  Now, number five on the rules for overlords is make sure that the media is a fully integrated part of the DSO team, the Deep State Overlord Team.
[03:34:38.405 --> 03:34:58.789]  The owners and the major talking heads of the major networks, with Fox being in a gray area, its own special case, but the ABC and NBCBS, those guys, Time, Newsweek, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, New York Times, these are the bellwether leading media sites.
[03:34:58.789 --> 03:35:03.170]  They're the ones that set the standard for what's truthful and valid and legit.
[03:35:03.985 --> 03:35:08.281]  Make sure that all of those owners are made members of the Deep State.
[03:35:08.942 --> 03:35:12.384]  You know, their kids are going to go to the same colleges with your kids.
[03:35:12.384 --> 03:35:14.806]  When they get out, they'll take turns interning.
[03:35:14.806 --> 03:35:16.727]  You know, your kid will intern for me.
[03:35:16.727 --> 03:35:18.488]  My kid will intern for you.
[03:35:18.488 --> 03:35:23.171]  And we all, you know, meet at the Cape or, you know, meet at Doral.
[03:35:23.171 --> 03:35:29.416]  And we conduct our business privately, but we all know that we're all on the same team.
[03:35:29.416 --> 03:35:36.040]  This is how you wind up with guys like Anderson Cooper, you know, whose parents were CIA from all the way back.
[03:35:36.713 --> 03:35:41.776]  This is basically the modern extension of Operation Mockingbird.
[03:35:41.776 --> 03:35:43.157]  And now they're not even hiding it.
[03:35:43.157 --> 03:35:51.642]  You know, you see Brennan and Clapper on network television, and these guys are the epitome of deep state overlords.
[03:35:51.642 --> 03:35:58.526]  So in our country, just like the way that Facebook gives a private look, a private veneer to the social credit system,
[03:35:59.831 --> 03:36:08.778]  In America, we have Pravda, but we have Pravda with, you know, a bunch of channels, but all the wires in the back are connected to the same outlet.
[03:36:08.778 --> 03:36:13.661]  So it gives the veneer of a free press.
[03:36:13.661 --> 03:36:17.024]  But if all there is is, you know, a monolithic liberal media,
[03:36:18.072 --> 03:36:25.940]  And then they can just say, well Fox, I mean only Hannity's talking about that and the Kooks, you know, Alex Jones, Rush Limbaugh, they don't count.
[03:36:25.940 --> 03:36:32.928]  So as long as they have a plurality of the deep state media, they can just stick to their airtight narrative.
[03:36:33.721 --> 03:36:40.267]  No matter what, like Baghdad Bob before the tanks rolled into Baghdad, they'll stick to the narrative.
[03:36:40.267 --> 03:36:42.709]  So it's critical that you have the media.
[03:36:42.709 --> 03:36:57.361]  That's how you can get away with, say, an Operation Fast and Furious, hundreds of dead Mexicans, and no reporters reporting about where the guns came from or how they were pushed to the cartels in order to smear the Second Amendment.
[03:36:57.361 --> 03:36:59.103]  I mean, that was a murder operation.
[03:37:00.081 --> 03:37:02.342]  Fast and Furious was a murder operation.
[03:37:02.342 --> 03:37:11.183]  When they got away with that, when the media firewalls held, then the Obama and Hillary Clinton administration, they knew they could get away with anything.
[03:37:11.183 --> 03:37:12.924]  They could sell our uranium.
[03:37:12.924 --> 03:37:15.824]  They could not rescue the people in Benghazi.
[03:37:15.824 --> 03:37:19.245]  They knew that the media would cover them no matter what.
[03:37:19.245 --> 03:37:22.666]  Okay, number six.
[03:37:22.666 --> 03:37:27.627]  Weaponize and politicize law enforcement, especially the Department of Justice,
[03:37:28.320 --> 03:37:31.043]  The FBI and the intel agencies.
[03:37:31.043 --> 03:37:43.615]  Well, for the last at least 10 years, my sources tell me that to get into the FBI, you practically, you have to at least fake that you're a social justice warrior, or you will never pass their intake screening.
[03:37:43.615 --> 03:37:48.740]  You know, you have to prove that in college you were, you know, a good comrade.
[03:37:48.740 --> 03:37:49.621]  So they're, they're
[03:37:50.580 --> 03:37:56.061]  Bringing through the ranks, the comrades, and they're promoting up the ranks, the comrades.
[03:37:56.061 --> 03:38:11.165]  That's how you get people like Peter Strzok as this sort of James Bond figure between all of, you know, saving Hillary from Uranium One and the email server, and then transitioning into the deep state coup against Trump.
[03:38:11.165 --> 03:38:15.306]  These are all SES, Senior Executive Service members.
[03:38:16.110 --> 03:38:31.080]  And I'm not saying that all of the couple thousand SES members in the country are corrupt and are social justice warriors, but even if a third of them are, that's enough, because what they do is, it's a term you need to understand called backstopping.
[03:38:31.080 --> 03:38:32.501]  They backstop one another.
[03:38:33.452 --> 03:38:46.178]  You know that you can get your friends off and you can nail your enemies because you know that the FBI agent will lie on his 302s, then charge somebody with 1001, lying to FBI.
[03:38:46.178 --> 03:38:49.500]  They know that corrupt judges will back them up.
[03:38:49.500 --> 03:39:00.205]  They know that between the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the corrupt federal judges, who are all social justice warriors, they can get away with anything.
[03:39:00.205 --> 03:39:02.166]  Now, after number six,
[03:39:03.010 --> 03:39:10.511]  Number seven is when the social media throttling is not effective, when somehow somebody's cutting through, like say a Tucker Carlson.
[03:39:11.423 --> 03:39:29.320]  Then you have to turn the screws up, and what they do is they look at these enemies, these bad comrades, from a deep state intelligence apparatus point of view, as if they were a Mission Impossible team in an enemy territory, and their job was to destroy somebody.
[03:39:29.320 --> 03:39:34.105]  And they'll look at it from all angles and say, well, we can't just shoot the guy, we'll have to
[03:39:36.679 --> 03:39:42.122]  Rig up a defamation case against him as a racist, which they're doing against Carlson right now.
[03:39:42.122 --> 03:39:51.186]  We'll have to maybe insert some false information, defamatory information about a false sexual history.
[03:39:51.186 --> 03:40:04.552]  If that doesn't work, if defamation, ridicule, throttling, so that you have no reach with your audience, if none of that works, these people absolutely are not above moving on to wet operations.
[03:40:04.552 --> 03:40:05.272]  And what I mean is,
[03:40:05.982 --> 03:40:10.527]  Putting something, you know, doing something that can sicken somebody.
[03:40:10.527 --> 03:40:12.649]  Instant heart attack is not out of the question.
[03:40:12.649 --> 03:40:16.733]  The technology has been available for, you know, decades and decades.
[03:40:16.733 --> 03:40:24.160]  And I think of people like Andrew Breitbart or Seth Rich or more lately in San Diego, Bray Payton.
[03:40:24.160 --> 03:40:28.504]  And I wonder, you know, they're not going to walk up and shoot somebody in the head.
[03:40:28.504 --> 03:40:30.266]  They're going to have to make it look plausible.
[03:40:30.876 --> 03:40:41.159]  You know, it's either going to be a street hit or an instant heart attack or, you know, instant swine flu and you're dead in 24 hours.
[03:40:41.159 --> 03:40:43.719]  This is crazy stuff, but these people are not above it.
[03:40:43.719 --> 03:40:55.162]  Remember, they did Operation Fast and Furious knowing hundreds of Mexicans would be killed and they did it so that they could get rid of the Second Amendment or try to curtail
[03:40:55.262 --> 03:40:56.102]  Thank you.
[03:41:17.672 --> 03:41:20.735]  And scapegoating serves a purpose of the deep state.
[03:41:20.735 --> 03:41:32.468]  It takes the attention of the unhappy masses off of the incompetently run economy, for example, and focuses it on an enemy that the deep state would also like to see eliminated.
[03:41:33.172 --> 03:41:46.959]  The landowning kulaks, the landowners in China, any group that the deep state would like to see out of the way will conveniently become the scapegoat for the anger of the masses.
[03:41:46.959 --> 03:41:52.362]  But first, they've got to do that tricky operation of disarming the population.
[03:41:53.002 --> 03:42:03.405]  And that's where I think that their plan is going to fall short, because they can't just grind this country into tyranny, which is what they're intending and trying fully to do.
[03:42:03.405 --> 03:42:12.108]  If Hillary had won, if there was a Democrat Congress right now, we'd be on the road to Venezuela, absolutely.
[03:42:12.108 --> 03:42:18.170]  But the best they can do, or maybe the worst, is foment the conditions for a civil war.
[03:42:18.889 --> 03:42:26.592]  They can't just cleanly get away with imposing a tyranny on us, not until we're disarmed.
[03:42:26.592 --> 03:42:29.272]  And that's why we'll never give up our guns.
[03:42:29.272 --> 03:42:34.734]  And if you, you know, what I always say, if you're going to go buy ammunition, buy it by the case.
[03:42:34.734 --> 03:42:37.575]  If ammo's worth buying, it's worth buying a lot.
[03:42:37.575 --> 03:42:40.876]  Because I think in the years to come, we're going to need it all.
[03:42:40.876 --> 03:42:45.878]  And when we come back on the other side of this break, then I'm going to go straight to the phone calls.
[03:42:45.878 --> 03:42:46.498]  See you in a minute.
[03:42:53.257 --> 03:42:57.218]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:42:57.218 --> 03:43:00.499]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:43:00.499 --> 03:43:06.761]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:43:06.761 --> 03:43:09.542]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:43:10.282 --> 03:43:14.106]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:43:14.106 --> 03:43:20.573]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:43:20.573 --> 03:43:25.538]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:43:26.280 --> 03:43:30.202]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:43:30.202 --> 03:43:37.406]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:43:37.406 --> 03:43:42.108]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:43:42.108 --> 03:43:48.312]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:43:48.312 --> 03:43:52.294]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:43:53.365 --> 03:43:57.609]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[03:43:57.609 --> 03:44:01.092]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[03:44:01.092 --> 03:44:02.854]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[03:44:02.854 --> 03:44:06.117]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[03:44:06.117 --> 03:44:12.923]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[03:44:12.923 --> 03:44:18.008]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[03:44:18.328 --> 03:44:24.434]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[03:44:24.434 --> 03:44:27.416]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[03:44:27.416 --> 03:44:28.517]  I want to keep going.
[03:44:28.517 --> 03:44:32.321]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[03:44:32.321 --> 03:44:34.363]  I want to push all the way.
[03:44:34.363 --> 03:44:35.664]  I've committed to do that.
[03:44:35.664 --> 03:44:36.725]  I've prayed for that.
[03:44:36.725 --> 03:44:38.387]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[03:44:38.387 --> 03:44:40.809]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[03:44:41.289 --> 03:44:42.612]  I will never falter.
[03:44:42.612 --> 03:44:44.957]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[03:44:44.957 --> 03:44:45.899]  I physically will.
[03:44:45.899 --> 03:44:52.653]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, then 444.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[03:44:54.076 --> 03:45:04.665]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:45:04.665 --> 03:45:06.727]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[03:45:06.727 --> 03:45:09.589]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:45:09.589 --> 03:45:10.770]  It's made in the USA.
[03:45:11.391 --> 03:45:11.651]  I think?
[03:45:34.781 --> 03:45:46.503]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:45:46.503 --> 03:45:49.784]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[03:45:49.784 --> 03:45:53.845]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Field and Infowarslife.com.
[03:45:53.845 --> 03:45:55.485]  Defeat the globalists.
[03:45:55.485 --> 03:45:57.225]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:45:57.225 --> 03:45:58.726]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[03:45:58.726 --> 03:45:59.826]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:46:00.782 --> 03:46:05.685]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:46:05.685 --> 03:46:09.487]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:46:09.487 --> 03:46:18.473]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:46:18.473 --> 03:46:27.859]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[03:46:28.539 --> 03:46:32.483]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[03:46:32.483 --> 03:46:38.449]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[03:46:38.449 --> 03:46:41.472]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[03:46:41.472 --> 03:46:42.993]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:46:42.993 --> 03:46:48.198]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[03:46:48.198 --> 03:46:52.623]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[03:46:57.209 --> 03:47:17.195]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:17.195 --> 03:47:19.556]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:47:19.556 --> 03:47:23.397]  It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[03:47:26.997 --> 03:47:36.402]  Okay, last segment, we're going to be taking phone calls, but I forgot to mention that one of my novels, Domestic Enemies, the Reconquista, it's free on Kindle today.
[03:47:36.402 --> 03:47:45.607]  So if you go to Amazon, my Kindle page, you can download my Southwest Civil War novel, Domestic Enemies.
[03:47:45.607 --> 03:47:51.330]  Anyway, let's get right to the phone calls, and we're going to have to go through them quick because we only got one segment here.
[03:47:51.330 --> 03:47:54.072]  So, Sean in New Jersey, what have you got for me?
[03:47:55.640 --> 03:47:57.862]  Something about the Second Amendment.
[03:47:57.862 --> 03:47:59.783]  Go ahead.
[03:47:59.783 --> 03:48:00.604]  How's it going, Matt?
[03:48:00.604 --> 03:48:02.406]  How are you doing today, brother?
[03:48:02.406 --> 03:48:04.027]  Great, thanks.
[03:48:04.027 --> 03:48:06.089]  Happy New Year's and God bless.
[03:48:06.089 --> 03:48:08.030]  Yeah, I don't know how you stand it in New Jersey.
[03:48:08.030 --> 03:48:12.314]  Did you turn in all your 30-round magazines?
[03:48:12.314 --> 03:48:15.116]  Um, I plead the fifth.
[03:48:15.116 --> 03:48:17.918]  Yeah, I'll bet.
[03:48:17.918 --> 03:48:19.780]  Okay, here's the deal.
[03:48:19.780 --> 03:48:22.762]  I'm a follower of Guns N' Gadgets.
[03:48:22.762 --> 03:48:24.784]  He's a cop in Massachusetts.
[03:48:26.252 --> 03:48:30.915]  And he covers every state when it comes to the Second Amendment.
[03:48:30.915 --> 03:48:33.036]  The Democrats have this new bill.
[03:48:33.036 --> 03:48:35.758]  It's SB-11-something.
[03:48:35.758 --> 03:48:42.943]  And it's their first bill they're going to try to push through the House, other than obstructing President Trump and the wall that we want.
[03:48:44.542 --> 03:48:47.483]  It is the absolute death of Second Amendment.
[03:48:47.483 --> 03:48:58.347]  It's the death of being able to manufacture a firearm and not having to register it so long as it meets the requirements for personal use.
[03:48:58.347 --> 03:49:04.649]  It's needing to go to an FFL to get a gun part.
[03:49:04.649 --> 03:49:05.469]  It's ridiculous.
[03:49:06.684 --> 03:49:23.430]  When are we the people going to wake up and realize that no matter whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, you all live behind high walls, you're protected by the guns you want to take away from us, and it is absolutely disgraceful.
[03:49:23.430 --> 03:49:30.032]  And all they do is pass laws that walk all over our Constitution.
[03:49:30.032 --> 03:49:35.974]  Well, Sean, I read something a couple years ago, an essay called Dear Mr. Security Agent.
[03:49:36.727 --> 03:49:41.991]  And it's primarily directed to federal law enforcement agents, but all law enforcement.
[03:49:41.991 --> 03:49:53.278]  It's not going to be the Manhattan and Malibu elites that are going to have to, you know, strap on the body armor and kick down the doors when they finally say, we've got to actually go confiscate these things.
[03:49:53.278 --> 03:49:56.060]  It's going to be cops and federal agents.
[03:49:56.060 --> 03:50:01.984]  And I want to tell them right here up front, buddy, any gun that was legal as say, you know, five years ago,
[03:50:02.795 --> 03:50:06.653]  If you try to pass a magic wand and say this gun is now makes you a criminal...
[03:50:07.276 --> 03:50:08.697]  Well, I'm going to keep the gun.
[03:50:08.697 --> 03:50:11.638]  And when you come and get it, you're going to get the bullets first.
[03:50:11.638 --> 03:50:17.661]  And, you know, after a while, there won't be enough federal agents because they're just going to run out of the numbers.
[03:50:17.661 --> 03:50:21.923]  They're just outnumbered a thousand to one by deer rifles.
[03:50:21.923 --> 03:50:29.306]  You know, 400-yard deer rifles fired one shot at a time will put an end to gun confiscation pretty fast.
[03:50:29.306 --> 03:50:35.749]  So it's easy for politicians and professors and movie, you know, Hollywood types to talk about this.
[03:50:36.349 --> 03:50:40.213]  But it's going to be the cops and the federal agents that have to do the dirty work.
[03:50:40.213 --> 03:50:41.894]  And there just aren't enough of them.
[03:50:41.894 --> 03:50:47.639]  And if they're down for that struggle, then they're definitely an enemy of the Constitution.
[03:50:47.639 --> 03:50:49.621]  That's the oath we all took.
[03:50:49.621 --> 03:50:50.942]  Enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:50:50.942 --> 03:50:52.643]  I can read the Second Amendment.
[03:50:52.643 --> 03:50:58.468]  And you try to tell me that my Glock 19 or my AR-15 is now illegal to possess?
[03:50:58.468 --> 03:50:59.670]  I say, screw you, baby.
[03:50:59.670 --> 03:51:00.410]  Come on.
[03:51:00.410 --> 03:51:01.211]  Moulin la Bay.
[03:51:02.037 --> 03:51:03.998]  Anyway, thanks, Sean.
[03:51:03.998 --> 03:51:05.880]  Let's get a Canadian perspective now.
[03:51:05.880 --> 03:51:07.621]  Alex in Canada.
[03:51:07.621 --> 03:51:09.462]  Canadian Communism, it says.
[03:51:09.462 --> 03:51:11.023]  Go ahead, Alex.
[03:51:11.023 --> 03:51:21.690]  Well, we're Canadian, so by listening and reading about your Constitution, I would agree with it a little bit more because it's clear and it doesn't infringe on our rights.
[03:51:21.690 --> 03:51:23.611]  But the thing is clear.
[03:51:23.611 --> 03:51:25.592]  Look at the French Canadian province, Quebec.
[03:51:25.592 --> 03:51:27.954]  They've just put a registry.
[03:51:29.293 --> 03:51:30.274]  On the firearms.
[03:51:30.274 --> 03:51:35.918]  We have to register our firearms, but it's the only province in Canada.
[03:51:35.918 --> 03:51:37.159]  It's something weird.
[03:51:37.159 --> 03:51:42.223]  And Ontario, putting a law... I don't know if you heard about that.
[03:51:42.223 --> 03:51:57.474]  I know that a few years ago, they tried to register the long arms and it was swamped with people putting in bogus, you know, registering hair dryers and it became such a fiasco that even the Liberals dropped it.
[03:51:58.345 --> 03:52:02.106]  Well, nobody's going to register their firearms here in Quebec.
[03:52:02.106 --> 03:52:02.467]  Don't.
[03:52:02.467 --> 03:52:02.807]  Don't.
[03:52:02.807 --> 03:52:04.587]  I wouldn't.
[03:52:04.587 --> 03:52:05.468]  I wouldn't.
[03:52:05.468 --> 03:52:10.550]  Or register one, you know, broken .38 or .22 and that's it.
[03:52:10.550 --> 03:52:13.731]  Just for the purposes of showing them something maybe.
[03:52:13.731 --> 03:52:19.733]  But I wouldn't register anything with a scope on it or anything that takes a magazine.
[03:52:19.733 --> 03:52:21.113]  But I've got to get through these really quick.
[03:52:23.434 --> 03:52:24.374]  Thanks.
[03:52:24.374 --> 03:52:26.835]  Aaron in California.
[03:52:26.835 --> 03:52:28.136]  Turn the other cheek, he says.
[03:52:28.136 --> 03:52:30.997]  Go ahead, Aaron.
[03:52:30.997 --> 03:52:31.357]  Hello.
[03:52:31.357 --> 03:52:36.959]  You know how you said earlier about fighting back as a Christian?
[03:52:36.959 --> 03:52:38.499]  Right.
[03:52:38.499 --> 03:52:43.721]  Well, in my interpretation, when Jesus said to turn the other cheek, it's to turn the other cheek to fight back.
[03:52:43.721 --> 03:52:44.221]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:52:46.704 --> 03:52:56.249]  Well, I think that it was mainly meant in a family or a social sense, you know, like, don't, don't, you know, replay your neighbor's hostility with hostility.
[03:52:56.249 --> 03:53:03.693]  But just as with, with thou shalt not murder being mistranslated intentionally into thou shalt not kill,
[03:53:05.043 --> 03:53:09.446]  Turn the other cheek became extended to just, there should never be a war.
[03:53:09.446 --> 03:53:11.608]  You know, there's never a good reason for war.
[03:53:11.608 --> 03:53:13.989]  And obviously that's ridiculous.
[03:53:13.989 --> 03:53:20.774]  I mean, if the Nazis or the Imperial Japanese Army is coming, what, you're just supposed to surrender and offer your daughters to them?
[03:53:20.774 --> 03:53:21.794]  Forget it.
[03:53:21.794 --> 03:53:24.576]  No, there's no way.
[03:53:24.576 --> 03:53:26.077]  Let's see.
[03:53:26.077 --> 03:53:29.119]  Thanks, Aaron.
[03:53:29.119 --> 03:53:31.801]  Richard in New York has something about the St.
[03:53:31.801 --> 03:53:32.521]  James Cross.
[03:53:32.521 --> 03:53:33.162]  Go ahead, Richard.
[03:53:34.147 --> 03:53:37.929]  Yes, Matt, there is, you know, the St.
[03:53:37.929 --> 03:53:51.696]  James Cross may be a mystery, but there's an actual fact in the United States that people have failed to recognize, and it's associated with two or three of the greatest spiritual mysteries on the face of the earth.
[03:53:51.696 --> 03:54:02.281]  They're located in the United States, and two of the mysteries are about the two witnesses before the Great Tribulation, and one of those witnesses is
[03:54:03.763 --> 03:54:07.865]  Michael the Archangel in the form of one of the two witnesses.
[03:54:07.865 --> 03:54:16.430]  Those two witnesses did appear in the United States down a dirt road sandwiched between two mountains in one of our Rocky Mountain states.
[03:54:17.432 --> 03:54:21.894]  Now, one of the... Where are you learning this from?
[03:54:21.894 --> 03:54:26.317]  I mean, is this like a Bible verse you're referring to, or is this... where is this coming from?
[03:54:26.317 --> 03:54:34.101]  Well, when it comes to turning out the cheek, the cheek is an avenue of the face, and the face is a means of expression.
[03:54:34.101 --> 03:54:35.482]  So what it's really telling you
[03:54:36.594 --> 03:54:40.035]  Turn up your level of expression.
[03:54:40.035 --> 03:54:43.256]  In today's media, it is your free speech.
[03:54:43.256 --> 03:54:45.676]  Turn up your level of free speech.
[03:54:45.676 --> 03:54:52.498]  Don't be a doormat for these clowns.
[03:54:52.498 --> 03:54:53.258]  I agree.
[03:54:53.258 --> 03:54:53.778]  I agree.
[03:54:53.778 --> 03:54:56.839]  That is a good way of looking at it.
[03:54:56.839 --> 03:54:57.399]  Thanks, Richard.
[03:54:57.399 --> 03:55:02.600]  I got to get through a few more calls in the limited time I got here.
[03:55:02.600 --> 03:55:04.461]  Wildman in Missouri.
[03:55:05.518 --> 03:55:07.699]  Go ahead, Wildman.
[03:55:07.699 --> 03:55:12.322]  They're going to get around the Second Amendment with these red flag gun laws.
[03:55:12.322 --> 03:55:14.223]  They're passing them in state after state.
[03:55:14.223 --> 03:55:15.544]  They just passed it in Illinois.
[03:55:15.544 --> 03:55:17.044]  They signed it last week.
[03:55:17.044 --> 03:55:18.925]  They're getting reintroduced at Missouri.
[03:55:18.925 --> 03:55:26.770]  And what I think they're going to do in each state that they pass these red flag gun laws in, they're going to push their people, the Democrats in the left wing,
[03:55:27.750 --> 03:55:41.436]  Call in and make up false accusations on all the conservative gun owners they know, and then they go and take their guns away, then you don't know about it, then you gotta go to court and try to prove what they said was false to get them back.
[03:55:42.125 --> 03:55:42.945]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:55:42.945 --> 03:55:53.208]  And not only can they do that, they can combine that with swatting to make it sound like there's something terrible going on in the house.
[03:55:53.208 --> 03:56:02.431]  So while you're just sitting down eating dinner, here comes the SWAT team coming in heavy, hoping that you're going to reach for a gun so you can be a dead gun owner.
[03:56:02.991 --> 03:56:05.152]  But, again, I've got to get back to the police.
[03:56:05.152 --> 03:56:06.833]  Hey, police!
[03:56:06.833 --> 03:56:09.354]  Hey, fleas, federal law enforcement agents!
[03:56:09.354 --> 03:56:14.317]  It's going to be you at the front doors of these houses, and I'm telling you, it's not going to be smooth.
[03:56:14.317 --> 03:56:16.038]  You better think about the Second Amendment.
[03:56:16.038 --> 03:56:18.979]  You better think about the oath you took.
[03:56:18.979 --> 03:56:20.460]  Thanks a lot, Wild Man.
[03:56:20.460 --> 03:56:21.320]  Jeff in Texas.
[03:56:21.320 --> 03:56:24.722]  We've got, I think, one more call, if we can get it in.
[03:56:24.722 --> 03:56:26.823]  Jeff, go ahead.
[03:56:26.823 --> 03:56:27.623]  Hey, Matt.
[03:56:27.623 --> 03:56:28.444]  Go ahead.
[03:56:30.597 --> 03:56:38.027]  I totally and 100% agree that the Globalist and the Deep State actually exist and they're pulling lots of strings.
[03:56:38.027 --> 03:56:45.277]  However, I live in a small community in East Texas where I just hadn't seen any of the signs yet.
[03:56:46.198 --> 03:56:55.831]  So my question is, man, what can we do to recognize, you know, when they're coming to my neighborhood, and what can I do to, you know, help stop this?
[03:56:55.831 --> 03:57:03.662]  If you live out in a rural area where, you know, your food doesn't come from 2,000 miles away, your water comes from underneath of your feet,
[03:57:04.783 --> 03:57:10.647]  Then you're probably way off, better, far ahead of most people, especially that live in the big cities.
[03:57:10.647 --> 03:57:14.530]  I would say just, you know, stay in shape, keep your eyes open.
[03:57:14.530 --> 03:57:17.212]  When you see cities on fire, then you'll know.
[03:57:17.212 --> 03:57:27.840]  But, you know, if you're in rural Texas or Missouri or Montana, you know, just to keep doing what you're doing and laying food for some bad years, food and ammunition.
[03:57:28.647 --> 03:57:32.370]  And make sure you know where your water comes from, under all conditions.
[03:57:32.370 --> 03:57:33.151]  All right, thanks a lot.
[03:57:33.151 --> 03:57:40.077]  This is Matt Frackin, and I'll see you Thursday after next, or whenever they ask me to come on in the meantime.
[03:57:40.077 --> 03:57:44.881]  And don't forget to download my book on Kindle.
[03:57:44.881 --> 03:57:48.805]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[03:57:50.518 --> 03:57:53.641]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[03:57:53.641 --> 03:57:56.303]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[03:57:56.303 --> 03:58:00.606]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[03:58:00.606 --> 03:58:07.972]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[03:58:07.972 --> 03:58:10.514]  You better understand that, because they're taking them right now.
[03:58:13.951 --> 03:58:16.172]  We have seen what they want to do.
[03:58:16.172 --> 03:58:19.193]  They called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[03:58:19.193 --> 03:58:31.119]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[03:58:31.119 --> 03:58:33.400]  It's the David Knight Show!
[03:58:33.400 --> 03:58:35.761]  Never miss your show, any day.

[03:58:44.048 --> 03:58:48.170]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
