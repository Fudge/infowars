[00:00.000 --> 00:22.600]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:22.600 --> 00:33.600]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked, and threatened.
[00:33.600 --> 00:38.600]  Because we are effective, the great awakening is here.
[00:38.600 --> 00:44.600]  Go to banned.video, download the videos, and share.
[00:44.600 --> 00:51.600]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com.
[00:51.600 --> 01:03.600]  And never give up the fight.
[01:03.600 --> 01:10.600]  Infowars.com.
[01:10.600 --> 01:13.600]  Where are people from my Democratic Party?
[01:13.600 --> 01:15.600]  Are they blind?
[01:15.600 --> 01:16.600]  Maybe AOC is blind.
[01:16.600 --> 01:18.600]  Clearly she doesn't see it.
[01:18.600 --> 01:28.600]  Where are the others in the Democratic Party to stand up and defend the innocent people of this country who are being victimized by criminals?
[01:28.600 --> 01:38.600]  The smash and grab epidemic, popularized by Black Lives Matter and marginalized by the Democratic Party, has come to the backyard of Austin, Texas.
[01:38.600 --> 01:39.600]  Oh, you're dead.
[01:39.600 --> 01:40.600]  You're dead.
[01:40.600 --> 01:42.600]  Oh, I heard a gunshot.
[01:42.600 --> 01:55.600]  According to witnesses, shortly before the Barton Creek Square Mall closed during the biggest shopping weekend before Christmas, smash and grab looters broken to the display cases at the Hellsburg Diamond Store.
[01:55.600 --> 02:05.600]  As patrons fled for the exits, an eyewitness claims that a voice came over the loudspeaker, announcing that the doors had now been locked.
[02:05.600 --> 02:14.600]  The innocent patrons now trapped inside with desperate armed lunatics in order to protect the profits of the blood diamond industry.
[02:14.600 --> 02:36.600]  Ladies screamed atop her lungs, run, there's a shooter, run.
[02:36.600 --> 03:00.600]  Meanwhile, Austin, Texas is in steep decline after the depletion of its police force under the policies of Soros Suck-Up Mayor Adler and Marxist District Attorney Garza.
[03:00.600 --> 03:07.600]  Jeremy Hendrick says he was at a Windsor Hills Neighborhood Association meeting when the discussion turned to recent drug crimes in the area.
[03:07.600 --> 03:10.600]  Like every neighborhood, we've got a few problem spots.
[03:10.600 --> 03:17.600]  Hendrick says two APD officers and a commander in attendance addressed neighbors' concerns, what they said surprised him.
[03:17.600 --> 03:21.600]  Their answer to that was, well, we really can't do much about it because the DA won't prosecute these folks.
[03:21.600 --> 03:23.600]  I think a lot of folks were kind of dumbfounded.
[03:23.600 --> 03:31.600]  There's no doubt this is a violent encounter, a shooting downtown over the weekend on Seventh and Red River.
[03:31.600 --> 03:34.600]  But some say this video represents more than an isolated case.
[03:34.600 --> 03:38.600]  It's a symbol of chronic crime rampant in downtown Austin.
[03:38.600 --> 03:41.600]  That's what the head of Austin's police union is saying.
[03:41.600 --> 03:52.600]  And as Austin real estate prices skyrocket by over 40%, real estate companies are removing crime statistics from their postings as it affects their bottom line.
[03:52.600 --> 04:00.600]  That is the longest 20 seconds of your life when you're on the ground literally thinking that the worst is going to happen to you.
[04:00.600 --> 04:06.600]  That's what went through Lily Thorpe's mind when she was attacked in August walking back to her West Campus apartment.
[04:06.600 --> 04:09.600]  Months later, Austin police still have not found the man.
[04:09.600 --> 04:12.600]  I fully expected nothing to come about this.
[04:12.600 --> 04:19.600]  Many parents say that university and city leadership aren't doing enough to curb crime in the West Campus area.
[04:19.600 --> 04:29.600]  When you have over 30,000 students living in that community, it really is an extension of the campus, whether the university wants to accept that or not.
[04:29.600 --> 04:36.600]  Safehorns petitioned Austin City Council to improve safety measures. Many of its signers were students.
[04:36.600 --> 04:39.600]  I'm scared as hell at school, one signer commented.
[04:39.600 --> 04:42.600]  Another, my daughter is afraid at your campus.
[04:42.600 --> 04:51.600]  For those of you questioning law abiding citizens' right to self-defense, is the Second Amendment beginning to make sense now?

[06:14.520 --> 06:18.040]  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Alex Jones Show. My name is Harrison
[06:18.040 --> 06:22.360]  Smith. I'm sitting in for Alex Jones for just the first hour, folks. Don't worry. Alex
[06:22.360 --> 06:26.640]  Jones will be here in one hour but I've been asked to take over the first hour and cover
[06:26.640 --> 06:32.720]  some of this bombshell news that has broken over the weekend and continues to break today.
[06:32.720 --> 06:36.160]  If you don't know who I am, I, of course, am the host of American Journal. That's the
[06:36.160 --> 06:42.600]  morning show, call-in show here on infowarsband.video. Each and every weekday morning, 8am to 11am,
[06:42.600 --> 06:48.240]  taking lots of calls today. Predictions for 2022. People don't think it looks good. 2022
[06:48.240 --> 06:52.000]  is not looking good. Some of the predictions we had were with China. Perhaps that's on
[06:52.000 --> 06:58.240]  the docket. The black horse of revelations coming to fruition. That also potentially
[06:58.240 --> 07:04.360]  on the docket for 2022. It's not looking very hopeful out there these days but there is
[07:04.360 --> 07:09.000]  reason to have hope. The hope to have is that people are asking questions. They're starting
[07:09.000 --> 07:14.320]  to see how ridiculous all of this stuff is and it's a good opportunity for us to say
[07:14.320 --> 07:17.720]  you want to know why all this is going on. You want to know why everything seems completely
[07:17.720 --> 07:22.480]  insane right now. Well, we have all of the answers and we'll get into some of those.
[07:22.480 --> 07:26.800]  But of course, the biggest news today is that New York legislation that's been put forward
[07:26.800 --> 07:32.120]  to be voted on January 5th provides for the indefinite detention of the unvaccinated at
[07:32.120 --> 07:40.920]  Governor's WIM. But it's even worse than that. Get a load of some of the strictures in this
[07:40.920 --> 07:46.160]  legislation. Here's a story from NationalPulse.com. New York legislation provides for indefinite
[07:46.160 --> 07:49.360]  decision of unvaccinated at Governor's WIM. In the next legislative session beginning
[07:49.360 --> 07:54.120]  January 5th 2022, the New York Senate and Assembly could vote on a bill that would grant permissions
[07:54.120 --> 07:59.960]  to remove and detain cases, contacts, carriers or anyone suspected of presenting a significant
[07:59.960 --> 08:07.160]  threat to public health and remove them from public life on an indefinite basis. Yeah,
[08:07.160 --> 08:15.440]  you heard that right. And the abilities that they are granting to unelected bureaucrats,
[08:15.440 --> 08:22.640]  in many cases low level heads of medical outlets, it's insane. It gives the governor of New
[08:22.640 --> 08:28.120]  York this bill or his or her delegates included but not limited to the commissioner and heads
[08:28.120 --> 08:33.120]  of local health departments, the right to remove and detain any individuals or groups
[08:33.120 --> 08:37.960]  of people through issuing a single order. The orders have to only include the individual's
[08:37.960 --> 08:43.160]  name or reasonably specific descriptions of the individuals or groups. They don't even
[08:43.160 --> 08:47.840]  have to know your name, let alone provide a warrant, let alone provide justification,
[08:47.840 --> 08:52.120]  let alone allow you to defend yourself and argue against this. They are putting on the
[08:52.120 --> 09:00.680]  table a bill to allow the indefinite detention of American citizens with no right to trial,
[09:00.680 --> 09:06.920]  no ability to fight back, no justification even needed to be provided, no limitations
[09:06.920 --> 09:12.120]  whatsoever on this and this is actually being voted on. This was actually put forward. This
[09:12.120 --> 09:17.440]  might actually pass in the state of New York. Is it becoming clear to you yet, folks? What
[09:17.440 --> 09:21.960]  all this was about? So I was saying on American Journal today that may be the right way to
[09:21.960 --> 09:27.800]  approach this is be in favor of it. Act like you're in favor of this because maybe, just
[09:27.800 --> 09:34.440]  maybe a way to break through to the Democrats what type of tyrannical authoritarian psychopathic
[09:34.440 --> 09:38.520]  nonsense they're getting behind these days, just put it on the other foot, put the shoe
[09:38.520 --> 09:44.480]  on the other foot, put the glove on the other hand and go okay, so you want to give a governor
[09:44.480 --> 09:49.560]  and his delegates, whoever that may be, commissioners, whoever, the power to just point at somebody
[09:49.560 --> 09:53.280]  and go that guy, you know, they don't have to know his name. Yeah, that tall guy, skinny
[09:53.280 --> 09:58.200]  guy, curly hair, yeah, that guy. Throw him in prison. He is a danger to public health.
[09:58.200 --> 10:02.440]  Not even is he a danger to public health. Actually, it says you can do this to people
[10:02.440 --> 10:10.760]  who are potentially a threat. Oh, they might potentially pose a threat and you can preemptively
[10:10.760 --> 10:17.280]  strike against them if they quote pose a threat in the future such as those refusing to receive
[10:17.280 --> 10:24.760]  the COVID-19 vaccination. So you ask the Democrats, you say okay, so you're going to give the
[10:24.760 --> 10:30.480]  governor power to arrest absolutely anybody, not have to prove his accusations, not give
[10:30.480 --> 10:35.880]  them time to defend themselves, no hearing, no lawyers, you don't even have to go through
[10:35.880 --> 10:41.000]  some sort of rubber stamp court like FISA or FOIA or any of these things and you can
[10:41.000 --> 10:45.280]  just arrest anybody that you claim poses a public threat and they're like, yeah, yeah,
[10:45.280 --> 10:48.880]  we're going to do that because we're vaccinated and smarter than you. It's like, oh, okay,
[10:48.880 --> 10:54.200]  all right, cool. And so if we vote a Republican into office, they'll be able to do this. So
[10:54.200 --> 11:00.480]  you're telling me you're giving Republicans power to arrest anybody that we deem as a
[11:00.480 --> 11:06.200]  potential public threat and to indefinitely entain them without any, yeah, okay, yeah,
[11:06.200 --> 11:10.600]  that sounds good. No, I think that sounds good. I think that will be very useful in
[11:10.600 --> 11:15.840]  the next couple of years. And you'll see the, like, well, no, no, you can't, no, you can't
[11:15.840 --> 11:20.280]  do, no, the Republicans can't do it for their own thing. No, it's fine. No, pass the bill.
[11:20.280 --> 11:24.320]  Pass the bill, then we'll see how it gets used. Pass the bill and then we'll see whether
[11:24.320 --> 11:32.280]  you're setting up a horrific totalitarian, authoritarian, just wild communist hell world.
[11:32.280 --> 11:36.160]  We'll see, we'll see how this goes. Maybe it works out fine. Maybe it's a great thing
[11:36.160 --> 11:40.760]  that you're doing this or maybe, maybe you're loading and cocking the gun that will be used
[11:40.760 --> 11:45.520]  against you one day. And maybe you should think about this for a second. But they're
[11:45.520 --> 11:52.220]  all for it. The bill quote will quote, require an individual who has been exposed to or infected
[11:52.220 --> 11:57.560]  by a contagious disease, not necessarily COVID, but just a disease to complete an appropriate
[11:57.560 --> 12:02.160]  prescribed course of treatment, preventative medication or vaccination, essentially giving
[12:02.160 --> 12:05.920]  the government the right to detain anyone they want and to forcibly vaccinate them,
[12:05.920 --> 12:13.080]  but just forcibly vaccinate, forcibly, you know, force into any sort of medical situation
[12:13.080 --> 12:18.200]  they want. I mean, it's very vaguely worded. They must complete an appropriate prescribed
[12:18.200 --> 12:25.400]  course of treatment, preventative medication or vaccination. So is it becoming clear where
[12:25.400 --> 12:31.640]  we are now? 2021 in America, New York state is now passing a bill to allow the indefinite
[12:31.640 --> 12:35.920]  detention. I just need to say this over and over and over again, because it's just, is
[12:35.920 --> 12:40.000]  this getting through yet? What's this Ronan gallery on Twitter? I'm a regularly fit 21
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.760]  year old lad. Don't say too much about the pandemic. I just chose to get on with it.
[12:44.760 --> 12:48.720]  My first two vaccinations were fine. No problem. After getting the booster two days ago and
[12:48.720 --> 12:53.440]  ever since I've had a very, very painful heart. Surely that's not normal. Oh no, it's extremely
[12:53.440 --> 13:00.880]  rare Ronan. It's extremely rare. It just happens all the time. It's kind of confusing. But
[13:00.880 --> 13:04.360]  thank God it's extremely rare because it's happening a lot. It's happening all the time
[13:04.360 --> 13:08.960]  continuously to everybody. Can you imagine if it wasn't extremely rare? Can you imagine?
[13:08.960 --> 13:14.440]  But of course, if they can trick you into it, if they can convince you into it, if they
[13:14.440 --> 13:20.000]  can bully you into it, it's still kind of your fault because you still willingly did
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.840]  it. Now, of course, the government will be picking you up in a van, taking you to some
[13:23.840 --> 13:27.920]  undisclosed location, maybe not telling you where anybody, you know, where you're going,
[13:27.920 --> 13:31.080]  certainly not reading your Miranda rights because you're not being arrested. You're
[13:31.080 --> 13:36.840]  being detained medically so they don't have to stick to the laws that restrict behavior
[13:36.840 --> 13:40.880]  when it comes to the Constitution and the ability of those in power. And then they'll
[13:40.880 --> 13:44.560]  inject you with this stuff and maybe you'll die. Maybe your heart will explode. Maybe
[13:44.560 --> 13:51.560]  you'll get thrombosis. Maybe you'll get myocarditis. And it'll be their fault and they'll have done
[13:51.560 --> 13:56.600]  it to you. And there will be no way for you to get any sort of redress from this. It's
[13:56.600 --> 14:00.800]  your fault after all. It's good for you. It's for the greater good. And it's for the greater
[14:00.800 --> 14:05.400]  good that we are violating these fundamental human rights that we are putting into place
[14:05.400 --> 14:11.080]  orders to absolutely run rough shot over every limitation of government so far. And that's
[14:11.080 --> 14:17.160]  not all folks. On January 5th, the legislative session will be hosting a number of assembly
[14:17.160 --> 14:22.560]  bills that include forced COVID shot mandates, forcing all adult vaccine records to go into
[14:22.560 --> 14:27.220]  a state database, forcing COVID shots for college students, and flu shots for elementary
[14:27.220 --> 14:31.920]  school students. It will eliminate religious exemptions for work and college, eliminate
[14:31.920 --> 14:37.760]  parents' consents to shots when the child reaches 14 years or older. So getting rid
[14:37.760 --> 14:44.680]  of parental consent when it comes to injections, that's also in this bill in New York State.
[14:44.680 --> 14:48.120]  It will also allow the governor, of course, to imprison without trial anyone she or he
[14:48.120 --> 14:54.040]  considers a public threat. It's just like, what? How did we get here? Well, it's been
[14:54.040 --> 14:59.440]  a very long road, folks. It's been a very long, slow road. See, the American constitution
[14:59.440 --> 15:06.640]  or the American attitude wouldn't have allowed for this even a year ago, even two years ago.
[15:06.640 --> 15:12.040]  But the last year and a half or two years at this point has been all about softening
[15:12.040 --> 15:18.120]  the ground for this landing, has been all about wearing down slowly but surely over time
[15:18.120 --> 15:24.200]  the resistance that Americans naturally feel towards tyranny and overreach of government.
[15:24.200 --> 15:31.480]  It's been about taking that down piece by piece, slowly but surely tearing that armor
[15:31.480 --> 15:38.000]  away. And so now here we are vulnerable, scared, fearful, and begging for the tyranny. It's
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.560]  been an incredibly successful psychological operation on a global scale. Funny that InfoWars
[15:43.560 --> 15:48.120]  was telling you about it before it even started happening. Isn't that interesting? That it's
[15:48.120 --> 15:53.760]  all coming to fruition. It's all coming down in 2022. It may very well be the year that
[15:53.760 --> 15:59.120]  they attempt their final solution, pun intended. We'll be right back. If you're concerned about
[15:59.120 --> 16:05.440]  the power grid. So this could be literally your last chance with all the insane things
[16:05.440 --> 16:11.280]  happening in the world to get InfoWars products and to support us into 2022, the do or die

[16:55.880 --> 17:02.880]  going to keep going 110% but we need your support.
[17:25.880 --> 17:32.880]  We're going to keep going 110% off.
[17:56.880 --> 18:03.880]  Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome. Hello,
[18:03.880 --> 18:08.160]  Alex. Yes, Malcolm. All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other
[18:08.160 --> 18:13.240]  Patriots can get on the line. Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts,
[18:13.240 --> 18:18.640]  Owen Schreuer. Supermail volatility and brain force plus. Mix those two together. You're
[18:18.640 --> 18:23.800]  an unstoppable tank. Supermail volatility really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs
[18:23.800 --> 18:29.400]  and natural compounds that have never been heated up and so it has a dramatic effect
[18:29.400 --> 18:33.680]  compared to powdered versions. They also work quite well but just aren't as strong. This
[18:33.680 --> 18:38.720]  is like a very fine wine. In fact, each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong,
[18:38.720 --> 18:41.680]  sometimes it's just okay. People are like, why are you selling something and admitting
[18:41.680 --> 18:46.560]  sometimes the batch isn't as strong? That's just how it is. It's how it works. So it's
[18:46.560 --> 18:51.040]  always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong. But yeah, if you want the Rolls
[18:51.040 --> 18:59.920]  Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[18:59.920 --> 19:04.960]  We here at Infowars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that
[19:04.960 --> 19:10.800]  is now available at InfowarsStore.com. Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in
[19:10.800 --> 19:15.280]  the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific
[19:15.280 --> 19:20.960]  Islands for relaxation and euphoric effects. According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava
[19:20.960 --> 19:27.000]  was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler
[19:27.000 --> 19:32.080]  and creator of the universe. The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings
[19:32.080 --> 19:37.080]  and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little. Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by
[19:37.080 --> 19:42.680]  many who enjoy its serious benefits. The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains
[19:42.680 --> 19:48.600]  a full blend of not only Kava Kava but other herbs including but not limited to German
[19:48.600 --> 19:54.520]  Comma Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and Valerian root. We do expect to sell this new product
[19:54.520 --> 20:01.600]  quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfowarsStore.com.
[20:01.600 --> 20:16.200]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:16.200 --> 20:19.840]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Harrison Smith here, sitting in for Alex Jones for
[20:19.840 --> 20:25.200]  the first hour. Alex will be back in the chair very, very soon, but boy oh boy, is there
[20:25.200 --> 20:31.160]  just an insane amount of news to cover today. Of course, the Biden administration is wishing
[20:31.160 --> 20:36.200]  their fellow American citizens a merry Christmas. They say this. They say, we are intent on
[20:36.200 --> 20:41.320]  not letting Omicron disrupt work in school for the vaccinated. You've done the right
[20:41.320 --> 20:48.720]  thing. We'll get through this. We'll get through it together, guys. For the unvaccinated, however,
[20:48.720 --> 20:53.480]  you're looking at a winter of severe illness and death for yourselves, your families, and
[20:53.480 --> 21:02.560]  the hospitals you may soon overrun. Repent! Repent or be destroyed! It's just wild. Literally,
[21:02.560 --> 21:05.760]  that's the quote from the White House. For the unvaccinated, you're looking at a winter
[21:05.760 --> 21:11.600]  of severe illness and death for yourselves, your families, and the hospitals you may soon
[21:11.600 --> 21:17.960]  overwhelm. A gentle reminder here, the vaccines don't help against Omicron. It's basically
[21:17.960 --> 21:22.240]  confirmed at this point. Omicron was discovered in vaccinated people. It spreads primarily
[21:22.240 --> 21:26.440]  through vaccinated people. Something like 80% of the people with Omicron are vaccinated
[21:26.440 --> 21:33.160]  at this point. Here's a story from Cornell University, which has a population 100% vaccinated,
[21:33.160 --> 21:38.200]  and yet they have 900 COVID-19 cases this week. Oh, my dear! They say, quote, virtually
[21:38.200 --> 21:42.800]  every case of Omicron variant to date has been found in fully vaccinated students, a
[21:42.800 --> 21:49.400]  portion of whom had also received the booster shot. So what are the Bidens talking about?
[21:49.400 --> 21:55.040]  Nothing. They're just baselessly fear-mongering, of course. Are you scared yet? Are you terrified?
[21:55.040 --> 21:59.720]  Are you ready to give up your hard-won freedoms? Or do we need to scare you a bit more? Is
[21:59.720 --> 22:04.920]  our frightfulness convincing? Truly incredible. But there's like, for the vaccinated, you're
[22:04.920 --> 22:09.760]  good little boys. You're good little slaves. Good job doing whatever we say. Everything's
[22:09.760 --> 22:14.800]  fine for you. Don't worry about it. You are probably more likely to get Omicron, actually.
[22:14.800 --> 22:18.200]  Actually being vaccinated doesn't actually prevent you from getting Omicron, actually.
[22:18.200 --> 22:22.120]  Now we're changing the definition to where you have to get the booster to be fully vaccinated.
[22:22.120 --> 22:27.520]  So special message here. A little shout-out to all of the fully vaccinated people with
[22:27.520 --> 22:34.360]  two vaccines in your arms. You unvaccinated swine, you plebeian, you anti-vax conspiracy
[22:34.360 --> 22:38.720]  theorist. You don't have your booster shot. You're unvaccinated now. You're one of us.
[22:38.720 --> 22:44.240]  How does it feel, dirtbag? So yeah, they're just changing the rules. So it's all very
[22:44.240 --> 22:47.800]  convenient, isn't it? It's like, we'll change the rules to where the people that followed
[22:47.800 --> 22:52.800]  our orders and got the vaccine, now they're considered unvaccinated. Oh, simultaneously,
[22:52.800 --> 22:56.560]  we're passing laws to allow us to imprison the unvaccinated people. So now we'll be
[22:56.560 --> 23:02.760]  able to imprison anybody that doesn't continuously keep up to date with our schedule of vaccines.
[23:02.760 --> 23:06.520]  Maybe every two months, maybe every four months, we'll decide that later. First, we'll get
[23:06.520 --> 23:11.960]  the punishment mechanism into place in order to destroy those who dare stand up against
[23:11.960 --> 23:17.640]  our tyrannical takeover of their country, their world, their way of life. Mind-blowing
[23:17.640 --> 23:21.280]  stuff. We do have some actual information about COVID, and I'll present it to you here
[23:21.280 --> 23:26.600]  unlike the mainstream media. Are you scared yet? Are you scared? Like, that's just be
[23:26.600 --> 23:31.560]  the permanent subtitle there. Yeah, you can never be fully vaccinated. Yeah, you're fully
[23:31.560 --> 23:37.320]  vaccinated for now. Yeah, we'll see you in a week, suckers. But now we're going to present
[23:37.320 --> 23:42.040]  some actual information here. It's not fear mongering. We'll tell you the real threats
[23:42.040 --> 23:45.200]  because they are real and horrifying, and you should be aware of them because you can
[23:45.200 --> 23:49.040]  actually fight back against them. When it comes to Omicron, let's look at whether or not we
[23:49.040 --> 23:53.520]  should be scared. Here's Johannes Borgen on Twitter. He says, looking at French COVID
[23:53.520 --> 23:57.960]  hospital data, I found something very intriguing. Since the beginning of the pandemic, I pay
[23:57.960 --> 24:02.720]  attention to a metric I call ICU exit rate. That is the percentage of ICU patients out
[24:02.720 --> 24:09.280]  of the ICU within seven days. This has been quite stable over the waves until now. And
[24:09.280 --> 24:14.520]  you can see a massive spike at the introduction of Omicron, meaning that there is a massive
[24:14.520 --> 24:20.320]  spike in the number of people that spend seven days or less in the hospital. So again, this
[24:20.320 --> 24:23.800]  isn't saying there are more people in the hospital. It's saying that if you're in the
[24:23.800 --> 24:28.600]  hospital, you're far, far more likely to be out and COVID free within seven days. So
[24:28.600 --> 24:36.760]  a huge spike in the number of people who get over Omicron very easily and don't have any
[24:36.760 --> 24:39.800]  side effects, you know, way laying on. So that's one chart gives you some information
[24:39.800 --> 24:44.040]  about COVID. Here's another one from Derek Thompson on Twitter. One of these is not like
[24:44.040 --> 24:49.960]  the other via Scott Gottlieb MD, seven day average of South Africa COVID statistics in
[24:49.960 --> 24:54.640]  blue, you have new cases. And each time a wave has occurred, this is the first wave,
[24:54.640 --> 25:00.640]  the alpha wave, if you will, you see a spike in hospitalizations followed by or in new
[25:00.640 --> 25:05.160]  deaths or new cases, I should say, followed by a spike in new deaths. Here's the Delta
[25:05.160 --> 25:10.080]  wave or, you know, no, this would be the winter wave last year, you have a spike in new cases
[25:10.080 --> 25:14.120]  and the resulting spike in deaths, that's the red line. Here's the Delta variant, you
[25:14.120 --> 25:18.600]  see a spike in cases and you see that the spike in deaths is not quite as prominent there
[25:18.600 --> 25:23.440]  since Delta, maybe it is as transmissible as the alpha variant, but it's not as deadly.
[25:23.440 --> 25:30.480]  So that's reflected in this lack of, you know, spike in the death rate. This is Omicron.
[25:30.480 --> 25:36.800]  Over here on the far right, a massive huge spike in new cases, meaning it's very transmissible,
[25:36.800 --> 25:42.960]  but not a single change in the death rate. In other words, huge spike in cases, no resulting
[25:42.960 --> 25:47.000]  death waves, which reflects the information, the legitimate information that we're hearing
[25:47.000 --> 25:52.880]  about Omicron, not the baseless fear mongering information, not, we expect there to be 75
[25:52.880 --> 25:58.400]  million dead by halfway through January, not Anthony Fauci's, everyone will die if we
[25:58.400 --> 26:03.280]  don't get vaccinated. Omicron will kill us all. Very mild symptoms, tickly throat, right?
[26:03.280 --> 26:07.480]  If you have a tickle in your throat, you're going to die, and that's a fact according
[26:07.480 --> 26:11.520]  to people like Anthony Fauci. In reality, people on the ground, people in South Africa
[26:11.520 --> 26:16.280]  who have been studying this since its beginning say it's a very, very, very mild form of the
[26:16.280 --> 26:20.360]  virus, and it's a good thing that this variant came about because it reflects the natural
[26:20.360 --> 26:26.040]  progression of all diseases where it starts off very virulent and very dangerous, then
[26:26.040 --> 26:31.040]  it gets more transmissible while being less dangerous and eventually just sort of becomes
[26:31.040 --> 26:35.120]  endemic, meaning it's just sort of a part of everyday life in the same way that flu
[26:35.120 --> 26:40.400]  or the cold is. That to the tyrants is a death knell. They can't have that. No, you have
[26:40.400 --> 26:45.400]  to be scared. This has to be a life-threatening thing. That way you get scared, that way you
[26:45.400 --> 26:50.480]  stop thinking, then they get to impose anything on you. Now you're begging for it for yourself.
[26:50.480 --> 26:57.880]  It's all very, very well orchestrated propaganda towards COVID. Now, we are getting to the
[26:57.880 --> 27:04.000]  end game here. We are getting to the final round. Whether that's the final round before
[27:04.000 --> 27:07.240]  ultimate victory or the final round before ultimate defeat, you have to be decided. It's
[27:07.240 --> 27:12.400]  up to us, actually. It's a choice we have to make. But it's not a surprise that we've
[27:12.400 --> 27:18.120]  gotten to this point, not if you're watching Infowars. I mean, it really is truly amazing
[27:18.120 --> 27:22.080]  when you look back at 2020 and you look back at January, how we were saying that it came
[27:22.080 --> 27:27.060]  from a lab back in January of 2020. We were saying it came from a lab before most mainstream
[27:27.060 --> 27:32.200]  outlets were even reporting that COVID existed in the first place, right? Because not only
[27:32.200 --> 27:36.880]  did we know that COVID was going around because we were looking at what was happening in China
[27:36.880 --> 27:40.520]  and trying to keep a tab on it and being called racist for doing that, by the way, weirdly
[27:40.520 --> 27:46.320]  enough. We'll talk about that later. But you can just see the playbook as it rolls out.
[27:46.320 --> 27:49.520]  You go, okay, so now they're introducing this. Then they're going to use this to justify
[27:49.520 --> 27:53.400]  vaccines. Then, of course, when they come out of lockdown, you go, okay, they're shutting
[27:53.400 --> 27:58.600]  down the economy. They're going to consolidate all of their power within the biggest corporations
[27:58.600 --> 28:03.160]  and governments, the Amazons and the Walmarts and that sort of thing. It was all perfectly
[28:03.160 --> 28:06.480]  clear how this was going to happen. And now we're seeing it come to fruition in the whole
[28:06.480 --> 28:09.120]  time that we're predicting this stuff and pointing out this is going to happen. We're
[28:09.120 --> 28:15.480]  being called crazy conspiracy theorist the entire time. But labels such as that don't
[28:15.480 --> 28:19.880]  stop us. They don't even slow us down. We thrive on it because we know that they've
[28:19.880 --> 28:24.440]  changed their tactics. They don't just censor information anymore. They have to overwhelm
[28:24.440 --> 28:27.960]  it with their own lies. So that's what they're attempting to do. And we know that and we
[28:27.960 --> 28:33.880]  know the harder they attack us, the more successful we are being. And we'll continue this fight
[28:33.880 --> 28:39.040]  until the end, no matter what the outcome is. And you can support us by going to infowarstore.com.

[29:14.640 --> 29:19.520]  after us. And if we don't support American businesses, and if we don't support independent
[29:19.520 --> 29:26.120]  media in the final days of 2021, we have no future in the midterms in 2022. 2022 is the
[29:26.120 --> 29:31.760]  year where America decides its fate. I want to thank you all for your support. I want

[31:00.960 --> 31:10.320]  that Christmas 2021 is here and soon will be in the year 2022. Everything the globalist
[31:10.320 --> 31:18.640]  plan on doing, their entire operations hinge on you psychologically, not understanding
[31:18.640 --> 31:24.600]  that they're trying to break your will, that they're trying to drive you into submission.
[31:24.600 --> 31:29.920]  But if you're aware of this basic fact and how they are scientifically controlling you,

[31:36.720 --> 31:40.560]  your mind. It's how I've been able to stand against the incredible attacks they've carried

[31:47.520 --> 31:52.960]  by becoming aware of the fact that I already transcended it. So until Christmas Day, we're

[34:34.320 --> 34:39.400]  whatever else you're eating. You eat nothing but bacon and eggs and hash browns. That's
[34:39.400 --> 34:43.480]  fine. Just take your vitamin mineral fusion. It's all balanced out. It's a balanced breakfast
[34:43.480 --> 34:47.280]  because as we know, our food no longer has the nutrients that we need. You can get vitamin
[34:47.280 --> 34:51.760]  mineral fusion and any number of fantastic supplements at infowarstore.com. Now with
[34:51.760 --> 34:56.280]  that, I want to go to one of the people that you're supporting when you go to infowarstore.com,
[34:56.280 --> 35:00.080]  and that is, of course, the very great Greg Reese. Here's his latest video that you can
[35:00.080 --> 35:05.560]  find and share at band.video. Lethal drug included an over-the-counter COVID test kits.
[35:05.560 --> 35:20.080]  Watch on October 25th of 2021. The CDC released an order continuing to deceptively act as
[35:20.080 --> 35:26.320]  if they have that authority requiring proof of negative COVID tests from all international
[35:26.320 --> 35:32.160]  air travelers two years old and up boarding a flight to the United States beginning on
[35:32.160 --> 35:39.160]  December 6th. The passenger has to be tested within 24 hours of travel. To meet the CDC
[35:39.160 --> 35:45.920]  requirements, the tests can be self-administered. The tests are not approved by the FDA but
[35:45.920 --> 35:51.600]  have been greenlit under the Emergency Use Authorization Authority. So if anything goes
[35:51.600 --> 35:58.200]  wrong, the manufacturer is free of liability. What could go wrong is that Abbott has included
[35:58.200 --> 36:05.680]  the lethal drug Sodium Azide into the do-it-yourself test kit. Sodium Azide has caused deaths
[36:05.680 --> 36:12.240]  for decades. Even minute amounts can cause organ damage, sowing most of its damage into
[36:12.240 --> 36:18.480]  the heart and brain. There is a small warning and instructions not to touch the swab to
[36:18.480 --> 36:24.840]  the regent solution, the lethal Sodium Azide. But mistakes happen, and there have been several
[36:24.840 --> 36:31.840]  deaths and injuries in hospitals and laboratories by trained professionals handling Sodium Azide.
[36:31.840 --> 36:37.240]  In one instance, Sodium Azide was poured down a drain, causing it to explode and release
[36:37.240 --> 36:47.560]  toxic gas. Sodium Azide is fatal if swallowed, fatal in contact with skin, and fatal if inhaled.
[36:47.560 --> 36:53.000]  And it is now included in over-the-counter test kits for frantic everyday citizens to
[36:53.000 --> 37:00.640]  hurry through a day before international travel, including two-year-olds. What could go wrong?
[37:00.640 --> 37:04.080]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[37:04.080 --> 37:09.640]  Amazing stuff. A lot of Greg Rees' reports like this one, you see the headline there,
[37:09.640 --> 37:13.840]  lethal drug included in over-the-counter COVID test kits. You think, well, that sounds a
[37:13.840 --> 37:18.640]  little extreme, doesn't it? There's no way that's right. He's probably, you know,
[37:18.640 --> 37:23.160]  beginning it somehow. He's making it sound worse than it is. And then you watch the video,
[37:23.160 --> 37:26.720]  and you're like, oh, no. No, that's exactly what's happening. No, that's exactly right.
[37:26.720 --> 37:32.480]  He's not exaggerating at all. Literally a lethal drug in the COVID home test kits that
[37:32.480 --> 37:37.520]  they want to impose on anybody and everybody all the time. Dr. Lena Nguyen on CNN was like,
[37:37.520 --> 37:43.680]  why don't we just test all Americans every day? Why not? It's like, you're a psychopath.
[37:43.680 --> 37:48.880]  That's a crazy thing to want. These people are insane. Incredible stuff by Greg Rees
[37:48.880 --> 37:56.800]  and just the latest, very long line of attempts to poison people courtesy of the United States
[37:56.800 --> 37:59.080]  government. And you know, I was watching that, and I was just thinking about something we
[37:59.080 --> 38:03.040]  were talking quite a bit about on American Journal this morning, which is the projection
[38:03.040 --> 38:09.120]  that liberals engage in when they don't feel like actually arguing with the points that
[38:09.120 --> 38:14.120]  you're making. Like, if you make an objection, if you say something that is scientifically
[38:14.120 --> 38:19.760]  foundational and, you know, comes from a place of true concern for all humanity, they don't
[38:19.760 --> 38:23.000]  want to address that. They don't want to listen to your arguments. They don't want to hear
[38:23.000 --> 38:27.280]  about it. So what they do is they just make up for themselves, fabricate in their own
[38:27.280 --> 38:31.460]  mind something that might make you want to say this thing, and then they just attribute
[38:31.460 --> 38:35.680]  it to that. What am I talking about? Well, it's like, in January 2020, when we hear at
[38:35.680 --> 38:39.160]  Info Wars, it was like, hey, there's something going on in China. Hey, guys, China, there's
[38:39.160 --> 38:43.400]  a sickness in China. It's looking pretty bad. We might want to pay attention to this. It
[38:43.400 --> 38:47.080]  might come here and then it'd be a big problem. Guys, China, something's happening in China.
[38:47.080 --> 38:51.360]  And they're like, you don't care. You don't care about sickness. You're just racist. You
[38:51.360 --> 38:55.520]  just hate Asian people. And so you're trying to make something up to make everybody else
[38:55.520 --> 39:00.760]  hate Asian people. And it's like, what are you talking about? There's a disease ravaging
[39:00.760 --> 39:03.880]  China. Why can we not talk about this? And they're just like, we know. We know what you
[39:03.880 --> 39:08.680]  really are saying. You're saying you're racist against Asian people. Well, I'll be in China
[39:08.680 --> 39:13.240]  town hugging an Asian person like a good American. It's just like, what, what could you possibly
[39:13.240 --> 39:17.840]  be taught? Like, what are you talking about? We don't get it. And of course, this comes
[39:17.840 --> 39:25.640]  from old Dr. Francis Collins, who was using this excuse to explain why he was not wanting
[39:25.640 --> 39:30.080]  to pursue the lab leak theory. See, he knows it probably came from a lab. He's perfectly
[39:30.080 --> 39:33.840]  aware of that because he was one of the people that helped to orchestrate the creation of
[39:33.840 --> 39:38.480]  this coronavirus. You know, he's one of the people that was in charge of the creation
[39:38.480 --> 39:44.200]  of the virus that has since killed 100, 800,000 Americans and millions of people around the
[39:44.200 --> 39:47.400]  world. Just, you know, so he doesn't want that out. He doesn't want that information
[39:47.400 --> 39:53.200]  out. See, he has a very, very personal reason to not want people to look into the lab leak
[39:53.200 --> 39:57.160]  theory. So how does he convince people not to look into the lab, lab leak theory? He
[39:57.160 --> 40:02.280]  projects that personal reason onto you. And he says, no, you're just want to go after
[40:02.280 --> 40:05.560]  the lab leak theory because it's political. He says it's politicized. We're just too
[40:05.560 --> 40:10.680]  politicized these days. And again, it's just like the Chinese thing. It's like, hey, look,
[40:10.680 --> 40:15.200]  you know, where the outbreak is, it's right next to this level four lab with a history
[40:15.200 --> 40:19.920]  of safety violations that's doing gain of function research on bat coronaviruses. This
[40:19.920 --> 40:24.360]  might be where it came from. And they're just like, would you leave the politics to the
[40:24.360 --> 40:27.760]  side? And it's like, no, no, no, I'm talking about the origin of the virus. I'm talking
[40:27.760 --> 40:32.720]  about where it possibly came from because that will inform, you know, where, you know,
[40:32.720 --> 40:37.520]  how it's how it how it functions, which will help us to treat it, which maybe will help
[40:37.520 --> 40:41.640]  us to prevent the cyber outbreak in the future. Maybe, you know, if we know this virus is
[40:41.640 --> 40:45.680]  the one that created it, they have data and information that will contribute to the effort
[40:45.680 --> 40:50.360]  to fight it. You know, we're trying to fight COVID here. And they're just like, why is
[40:50.360 --> 40:54.680]  everything so politicized, man? We're not looking at lab leak theory. That's a Trump
[40:54.680 --> 41:01.480]  conspiracy theory. What, what are they like, what are they talking like that? It really
[41:01.480 --> 41:04.600]  is insane. I mean, I know we use the word insane a lot, but like this is this is the
[41:04.600 --> 41:12.280]  mindset of a clinically insane person. Okay. Because he says he dodged questions about
[41:12.280 --> 41:16.680]  his efforts to discredit the lab leak theory at the onset of the pandemic, maintaining
[41:16.680 --> 41:20.880]  the most plausible explanation is that the virus spread through animal to human transmission.
[41:20.880 --> 41:26.560]  Oh, sure. Even though now, you know, there are MPs in the European Union who are being
[41:26.560 --> 41:31.720]  presented findings by well respected and established researchers who have come to the conclusion.
[41:31.720 --> 41:34.920]  Yeah, it's probably a lab leak. Yeah, it was probably a lab leak. And we've talked about
[41:34.920 --> 41:39.960]  how this this was an IQ test, right? It started from this neighborhood and in this neighborhood
[41:39.960 --> 41:45.200]  is a farmer's market. Okay. So it either came from the farmer's market or it came from
[41:45.200 --> 41:48.880]  the level four bio weapons lab with a history of safety violations. Where do you think it
[41:48.880 --> 41:56.080]  came from? This is an IQ test that America has failed. He said in October of this year
[41:56.080 --> 41:59.760]  that accusations arounding the agency's involvement in gain of function research at the Wuhan
[41:59.760 --> 42:05.200]  Institute of Virology were absolutely nothing to do with his resignation. But there were
[42:05.200 --> 42:10.360]  private emails that shows that he coordinated with Dr. Anthony Fauci in order to discredit
[42:10.360 --> 42:16.080]  the lab leak theory by making use of Amazon owned Washington Post. So here you have Amazon
[42:16.080 --> 42:21.640]  and their press outlet Washington Post collaborating with Francis Collins and Dr. Fauci in order
[42:21.640 --> 42:28.240]  to discredit without providing alternative evidence for the lab leak theory. It's a
[42:28.240 --> 42:33.080]  cabal to conspiracy. This is what we call a conspiracy folks. These are people working
[42:33.080 --> 42:41.600]  behind the scenes cooperating in order to discredit a Nobel Prize winning suggestion as to where
[42:41.600 --> 42:47.360]  this lab could have come from. He says, you know, we've gotten, we've gotten all this
[42:47.360 --> 42:51.760]  hyper politicized stuff. It's getting in the way of public health. It's like, no, we're
[42:51.760 --> 42:55.960]  trying to figure out where the virus came from and you're stopping us because of politics.
[42:55.960 --> 43:04.080]  Stop projecting. So this could, so this could be literally your last chance with all the

[44:53.160 --> 45:04.880]  Infowar's life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine. Introducing pollen block.
[45:04.880 --> 45:10.160]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[45:10.160 --> 45:17.080]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[45:17.080 --> 45:23.040]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[45:23.040 --> 45:28.520]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published
[45:28.520 --> 45:34.760]  trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet
[45:34.760 --> 45:40.280]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective. It
[45:40.280 --> 45:44.920]  is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by
[45:44.920 --> 45:50.280]  blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[45:50.280 --> 45:56.400]  responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarstore.com
[45:56.400 --> 45:59.560]  and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[45:59.560 --> 46:07.160]  Well here we are. The year 2021 is almost over. Christmas is just a few days away. I
[46:07.160 --> 46:12.520]  want to take a little bit of time out to thank you all for keeping us in the fight. The New
[46:12.520 --> 46:17.760]  World Order would have already basically won if it wasn't for InfoWars and I'm not bragging.
[46:17.760 --> 46:22.320]  I'm letting you know that together as a family we have changed the world and that we have
[46:22.320 --> 46:27.840]  a responsibility because God put us in this position to not back down now at the very
[46:27.840 --> 46:32.440]  critical point. This is an Info War and the Globals are trying to break your will and
[46:32.440 --> 46:38.040]  demoralize you and I produced a two-part course, Mind Wars, Spirit Wars, six plus hours that
[46:38.040 --> 46:43.480]  lays out the most game changing information ever. It's available right now at resetwars.com

[46:56.080 --> 47:01.400]  and thanks for keeping InfoWars on the air.
[47:01.400 --> 47:09.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:09.800 --> 47:14.000]  You said earlier this week that if you're vaccinated you should feel comfortable traveling
[47:14.000 --> 47:20.240]  and celebrating the holidays with your family. Do you still believe that?
[47:20.240 --> 47:26.800]  No, I do. If you are vaccinated and boosted and are prudent when you travel, when you're
[47:26.800 --> 47:34.360]  in an airport to be wearing a mask all the time, you have to be wearing a mask on a plane.
[47:34.360 --> 47:40.600]  Do not do things like go to gatherings where there are people who you do not know what
[47:40.600 --> 47:46.440]  their vaccination status is. If you do that and some people are even going the extra step
[47:46.440 --> 47:51.480]  or the extra mile, maybe even getting tested when you have people coming over the house,
[47:51.480 --> 47:57.560]  we now have a much water availability of point of care tests that you can get a result in
[47:57.560 --> 48:04.160]  about 15 minutes. So you might want to do that. If you do these things, John, I do believe
[48:04.160 --> 48:09.400]  that you can feel quite comfortable with a family setting, the dinners and the gatherings
[48:09.400 --> 48:15.680]  that you have around the holiday season. Nothing is 100% risk-free, but I think if you do the
[48:15.680 --> 48:20.760]  things that I just mentioned, you'd actually mitigate that risk enough to feel comfortable
[48:20.760 --> 48:23.440]  about being able to enjoy the holiday.
[48:23.440 --> 48:30.240]  Oh man, can you just imagine? Do you have the ability to imagine what it would be like
[48:30.240 --> 48:36.560]  to be somebody that watches that dude seriously? That's like scared of Omicron. Like, I honestly
[48:36.560 --> 48:42.160]  can't imagine being like, another wave, Omicron, another variant, got to get my booster and
[48:42.160 --> 48:47.800]  like I'm super scared about going to dinner. But oh, oh, but Anthony Fauci's told me that
[48:47.800 --> 48:52.920]  all I have to do is make sure everyone I ever interact with has fully been vaccinated and
[48:52.920 --> 48:57.720]  also been boosted and also taken a test and I'll wear my mask and my other mask and I'll
[48:57.720 --> 49:02.840]  wear my goggles and then he tells me I can feel comfortable. Thank goodness. Like you
[49:02.840 --> 49:11.440]  poor, weak little scumbag. It's just, it's just hilarious. Actually, it's actually hilarious.
[49:11.440 --> 49:15.440]  Omicron, not particularly dangerous. I showed you some of the charts a little bit before.
[49:15.440 --> 49:21.080]  A little bit before. It also, clearly, the evidence overwhelming does not get stopped
[49:21.080 --> 49:25.800]  by the vaccine. It's pretty obvious at this point. Elizabeth Warren just got COVID. Jim
[49:25.800 --> 49:30.400]  Kramer just got COVID. Cory Booker just got COVID, all three of which not just vaccinated,
[49:30.400 --> 49:34.640]  not just fully vaccinated, but fully vaccinated plus the booster. So, you know, now they're
[49:34.640 --> 49:37.480]  actually covering for this and the medical journals are saying we think the best way
[49:37.480 --> 49:44.400]  to fight off COVID to avoid getting COVID is to take two vaccines and the booster and
[49:44.400 --> 49:48.600]  get COVID and that'll protect you from COVID. And they're saying that with a straight face
[49:48.600 --> 49:54.440]  in a serious manner, acting like it's not hilarious. It is. It's also terrifying and
[49:54.440 --> 49:59.920]  horrific and the death of this country. So, maybe it's not as funny as it could be, but
[49:59.920 --> 50:07.640]  certainly ironic, certainly worthy of a joke, I'd say. It's just amazing. I mean, the vaccine,
[50:07.640 --> 50:11.680]  it clearly doesn't work against Omicron. I don't think anybody is arguing that at this
[50:11.680 --> 50:19.480]  point. And now there are even more evidence now as New Zealand links 26-year-old man's
[50:19.480 --> 50:24.760]  death to Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. They might actually kill you. So, you have to take the
[50:24.760 --> 50:30.320]  vaccine even though A, doesn't protect you. B, doesn't stop you from transmitting the
[50:30.320 --> 50:34.120]  disease and C, might kill you. So, yes, it might kill you. You know, it doesn't stop
[50:34.120 --> 50:38.640]  you from getting the disease. Yes, you do have to take it or you will be in prison without
[50:38.640 --> 50:44.120]  trial in New York. Unbelievable how we've allowed it to get to this place. But of course, they
[50:44.120 --> 50:53.120]  have very, very sophisticated rhetorical tactics that they use, propaganda tactics. The manufacturing
[50:53.120 --> 51:00.000]  of consent to their despicable and outrageous demands is sort of their business, sort of
[51:00.000 --> 51:04.360]  their bread and butter. So, that's what they do. Okay. Now, I was serious when I said that
[51:04.360 --> 51:09.200]  headline from Forbes. Super immunity from breakthrough. Here's what we do. And it literally
[51:09.200 --> 51:13.560]  says the best way to be protected is to get the vaccine and then get COVID and that'll
[51:13.560 --> 51:20.160]  protect you from COVID. Okay. All right. So, let's talk about some of these propaganda
[51:20.160 --> 51:26.240]  efforts that they're engaged in. The coordination behind the scenes. You know, the gray reset.
[51:26.240 --> 51:31.480]  That's just great coordination. The great merging. The great cooperation, it should
[51:31.480 --> 51:38.920]  be called, as all of the largest and most powerful cabals of corporations and governments
[51:38.920 --> 51:44.000]  and think tanks and NGOs all work hand in hand and the media, of course, to perpetuate
[51:44.000 --> 51:51.240]  lies and enslave the world. Collins, Dr. Francis Collins joined Fox News Sunday on his last
[51:51.240 --> 51:55.600]  day in office after more than a decade in the agency's top position, the geneticists
[51:55.600 --> 52:00.400]  and physicians tapped by President Barack Obama to lead the NIH in 2009, dodged questions
[52:00.400 --> 52:05.280]  about his efforts to discredit the lab leak theory at the onset of the pandemic, maintaining
[52:05.280 --> 52:08.720]  the most plausible explanation for the virus is that the virus spread through animal to
[52:08.720 --> 52:13.160]  human transmission saying, quote, I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry that the lab leak
[52:13.160 --> 52:18.600]  has become such a distraction for so many people because frankly, we still don't know.
[52:18.600 --> 52:25.720]  I'm sorry. What was that, Dr. Collins? You what? Oh, you don't know? Then why are you
[52:25.720 --> 52:30.320]  discrediting it? Why are you saying it's a distraction? Why are you saying it's conspiracy
[52:30.320 --> 52:36.400]  theory if you don't know? Does it just make sense to anybody? Like, how are they getting
[52:36.400 --> 52:41.240]  away with this? And then you start to understand, oh, this is what the dumbing down was all
[52:41.240 --> 52:46.060]  about. This is what the fluoride in the water was about. This is what the failure of education
[52:46.060 --> 52:52.480]  was about. It's all been a readying the landing for this. It's been about one by one, unscrewing
[52:52.480 --> 52:59.600]  your armor to take it off and leave you defenseless in front of them in your mind, physically defenseless
[52:59.600 --> 53:03.960]  so they can have their way with you. That's what this has all been about because this
[53:03.960 --> 53:12.280]  type of stuff would not be able to be achieved with an intelligent and informed citizenry.
[53:12.280 --> 53:19.000]  It wouldn't make any sense. Not only would this bill by the New York legislator not pass,
[53:19.000 --> 53:22.400]  which it isn't, it's probably going to pass, to be honest with you. I mean, they're run
[53:22.400 --> 53:27.960]  by socialists and this is socialism, so it's probably going to pass. But if you had a informed
[53:27.960 --> 53:32.800]  patriotic American citizenry with people that were intelligent and could think for themselves
[53:32.800 --> 53:38.440]  and understood and respected liberty and freedom and want it meant to be an American, then
[53:38.440 --> 53:48.720]  everyone who even dared breathe a word of suggestion as to this type of legislation would be removed
[53:48.720 --> 53:54.840]  from office. It would be seen as a egregious and blatant violation of their every oath
[53:54.840 --> 54:01.000]  of office and they would be removed from office. That's why we have elections. That's why the
[54:01.000 --> 54:06.260]  American people have the final say. Unfortunately, after literally decades of concerted effort
[54:06.260 --> 54:11.160]  to dumb down and humiliate and weaken the American people, they're actually getting away with
[54:11.160 --> 54:17.880]  this stuff. They're putting this stuff forward and they have the American people, you know,
[54:17.880 --> 54:25.160]  at large so brainwashed and controlled that they're going to get away with it and they
[54:25.160 --> 54:30.240]  might actually pass it. And it leaves us in a very troublesome situation because we're
[54:30.240 --> 54:36.800]  here just having to try to batter down all of these attempts. Because you know what will
[54:36.800 --> 54:39.760]  happen if this legislation doesn't pass, they'll reword it a little bit and they'll get it
[54:39.760 --> 54:43.200]  through anyway. Or they'll just do it anyway, right? It's like they'll try to pass it through
[54:43.200 --> 54:46.760]  the legislature and if that doesn't work, then they'll just convene an equity committee
[54:46.760 --> 54:51.040]  and just do it through that method. It doesn't matter. They're power hungry psychopaths.
[54:51.040 --> 54:54.280]  They'll do whatever they have to. If you try to stand up to them, you're a domestic terrorist
[54:54.280 --> 54:58.160]  and you look a little sick and maybe you'll be sent to a quarantine camp for an indefinite
[54:58.160 --> 55:04.120]  amount of time. So that's what's happening. But again, it's just amazing this Francis
[55:04.120 --> 55:13.240]  Collins interview. It's just like I literally don't understand it. He says we in this country
[55:13.240 --> 55:17.760]  have somehow gotten all fractured and hyper politicized political view that should never
[55:17.760 --> 55:21.520]  have been mixed with public health, Collins said. It has been ruinous and history will
[55:21.520 --> 55:26.800]  judge harshly those people who have continued to defocus the effort and focus on conspiracies
[55:26.800 --> 55:32.720]  and things that are demonstrably false. Have you demonstrated it, sir? Where is the demonstration
[55:32.720 --> 55:36.360]  of the falsity of these statements? Oh, you don't have it because earlier you said you
[55:36.360 --> 55:40.880]  actually don't know because you've referenced the fact that China has withheld the information
[55:40.880 --> 55:45.720]  from it. So it actually could be true. So it actually is a vital part of the understanding
[55:45.720 --> 55:53.720]  of this virus that you are engaged in destroying our understanding of and, you know, discrediting
[55:53.720 --> 56:00.600]  people that are posing alternative views. Incredible, isn't it? So it's just like, I don't know,
[56:00.600 --> 56:04.720]  insane is the only word for it because just to be not insane in this world is to feel
[56:04.720 --> 56:10.160]  insane and that's how insane it is because it's like, well, there's this virus. There's
[56:10.160 --> 56:13.080]  this virus that we need to deal with. We need to figure out how to deal with it. We need
[56:13.080 --> 56:16.880]  to know information about it. Well, we should probably know where it came from. If we knew
[56:16.880 --> 56:21.160]  where it came from, we could maybe know how it came about. If we knew how it came about,
[56:21.160 --> 56:25.480]  maybe that would help us not just treat it or cure it or find out about how it transmits.
[56:25.480 --> 56:29.800]  It would inform the way that we combat this virus. It may even inform the way that we
[56:29.800 --> 56:34.960]  make the vaccines if that's what you're trying to do. So there's lots of reasons to find
[56:34.960 --> 56:40.240]  out the origin of the virus. So again, you just sit here and you go, it looks like the
[56:40.240 --> 56:44.880]  origin of the virus was a lab in Wuhan and they're just like, why are you politicizing
[56:44.880 --> 56:48.960]  things? What are you talking about politics? I'm talking about the origin of the virus
[56:48.960 --> 56:52.840]  and they're like, yeah, we're trying to focus on the virus. Okay, so maybe stop trying to
[56:52.840 --> 56:58.800]  distract us. No, no, I'm talking about the origin of the virus and where it came from
[56:58.800 --> 57:02.640]  and they're like, stop distracting us from the virus. We're trying to figure out about
[57:02.640 --> 57:06.360]  the virus here and you keep bringing up stuff about the virus and it's just politicizing
[57:06.360 --> 57:10.920]  things. It truly is insane. Collins made headlines on Friday after House select subcommittee on
[57:10.920 --> 57:14.880]  the coronavirus crisis released an email where he expressed deep concerns about the herd
[57:14.880 --> 57:21.100]  immunity strategy being advocated by fringe epidemiologists. You know, fringe epidemiologists
[57:21.100 --> 57:26.960]  like Nobel Prize winners and fellows at the Stanford Institute. And again, they don't
[57:26.960 --> 57:33.120]  provide information. This is all about just imposing of their will. It's about pure strictly
[57:33.120 --> 57:39.160]  is about power. They don't want to interact with your objections. They don't want to confront
[57:39.160 --> 57:45.240]  your arguments. It's far, far easier to say you're politicizing things. Shut up. Convenient
[57:45.240 --> 57:56.920]  forum, isn't it? It's hard to believe this could be in full wars last Christmas. Because
[57:56.920 --> 57:59.240]  it could be America's last Christmas. Evil is taking over the planet. They're destroying
[57:59.240 --> 58:03.760]  our borders, our sovereignty, our supply chains, our language, our currencies. They're coming
[58:03.760 --> 58:08.640]  after us. And if we don't support American businesses, and if we don't support independent
[58:08.640 --> 58:15.200]  media in the final days of 2021, we have no future in the midterms in 2022. 2022 is the
[58:15.200 --> 58:20.880]  year where America decides its fate. I want to thank you all for your support. I want
[58:20.880 --> 58:24.800]  to encourage you to your Christmas shopping, then fullwarstore.com, because I can barely
[58:24.800 --> 58:29.440]  keep our operation going. And I appreciate you keeping us in the position to fight back.

[59:55.040 --> 1:00:05.400]  you are the resistance. The globalist are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual
[1:00:05.400 --> 1:00:10.600]  warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food, it's all come out. And they're
[1:00:10.600 --> 1:00:15.040]  doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of God, the creator and
[1:00:15.040 --> 1:00:21.480]  we are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much. So that's why I repeat that
[1:00:21.480 --> 1:00:28.160]  famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true. The
[1:00:28.160 --> 1:00:35.000]  propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was over. They need all the propaganda and
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:41.080]  all their lives and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we
[1:00:41.080 --> 1:00:45.480]  are strong. You know, in the end, they signed on the God of this world who is a loser. And
[1:00:45.480 --> 1:00:49.280]  that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars in the air now more than ever.
[1:00:49.280 --> 1:00:53.680]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalist are manifesting and setting
[1:00:53.680 --> 1:00:58.480]  up is safe and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they
[1:00:58.480 --> 1:01:07.240]  just announced. I think we know. Everybody but Roberts is in the tank for the right wing
[1:01:07.240 --> 1:01:12.600]  extreme views. And I think this vigil anism is going to catch on. These red states are
[1:01:12.600 --> 1:01:18.120]  going to do vigil anism laws on immigration. And they're going to empower citizens to go
[1:01:18.120 --> 1:01:25.480]  out and round up people they think look like foreigners. A human trafficking epidemic continues
[1:01:25.480 --> 1:01:30.120]  to spiral out of control under the clowered Piven strategy of the Biden administration.
[1:01:30.120 --> 1:01:37.520]  A chaotic and deadly scene in the Mexican state of Chiapas. At least 55 people killed
[1:01:37.520 --> 1:01:42.800]  and over 100 injured when the truck they were crammed into crashed on its side. Survivors
[1:01:42.800 --> 1:01:50.120]  say it happened on a sharp curve. In front of a judge, you Joe pleads not guilty to the
[1:01:50.120 --> 1:01:54.720]  stabbing death of a man last month. According to his arrest report, witnesses found you
[1:01:54.720 --> 1:02:00.720]  Joe covered in blood in an Arlington neighborhood on October 7th. The report shows you Joe told
[1:02:00.720 --> 1:02:06.000]  a witness. He killed Uncle Francisco because he hit him. Once police took you Joe into
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:11.720]  custody, they learned he gave them a fake name and told them he was 17. Ice investigators
[1:02:11.720 --> 1:02:17.360]  then determined you Joe is actually 24 from Honduras and was in the country illegally
[1:02:17.360 --> 1:02:22.640]  and overcrowded van carrying 30 people. Many of them believed to be illegal immigrants
[1:02:22.640 --> 1:02:28.040]  crashed in southern Texas on Wednesday, killing 10 and injuring many others. According to
[1:02:28.040 --> 1:02:34.040]  police is vice president Harris still in charge of addressing the root causes of migration
[1:02:34.040 --> 1:02:39.560]  from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. She is and I just announced a commitment that
[1:02:39.560 --> 1:02:45.480]  she's announcing this afternoon. He said, uh, vice president Harris is not spoken to
[1:02:45.480 --> 1:02:52.080]  her and if she's in charge, why, why is that? Well, we all kidding aside, of course, president
[1:02:52.080 --> 1:02:57.880]  Harris, president Harris. Meanwhile, residents of Yuma, Arizona were horrified to witness
[1:02:57.880 --> 1:03:03.000]  thousands of immigrants roaming through their community. An estimated 7,000 migrants have
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:08.720]  entered into Arizona near Yuma since last Thursday. Local officials can only guess the
[1:03:08.720 --> 1:03:16.400]  number because the Biden administration won't release an actual Cal. Mr. President, do something.
[1:03:16.400 --> 1:03:22.640]  Do anything. Networking gangs are cashing in on the lucrative human smuggling racket.
[1:03:22.640 --> 1:03:27.880]  This video from Yuma, Arizona, an armed smuggler with his hand on his gun threatened daily caller
[1:03:27.880 --> 1:03:33.160]  reporter Orhei Ventura. Ventura had just captured video of the smuggler being paid
[1:03:33.160 --> 1:03:37.840]  by a migrant. The smuggler ordered Ventura to put his phone on the ground. Orhei joins
[1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:44.760]  us. Where does the cartels, newfound hoods, but come from? Well, Leland, they're getting
[1:03:44.760 --> 1:03:49.760]  more brazen and they're just not, they're not afraid of any type of enforcement at all.
[1:03:49.760 --> 1:03:55.320]  And these huge migrant influx just gives them more an ability to essentially overwhelm border
[1:03:55.320 --> 1:03:59.440]  patrol at different sectors at the border. And they're making more money than ever. We're
[1:03:59.440 --> 1:04:03.640]  speaking to border patrol who tells us they're making up to $14 million a day. While blue
[1:04:03.640 --> 1:04:10.480]  strongholds move to legalize the growing illegal immigrant voting block. And as 2 million illegals
[1:04:10.480 --> 1:04:16.760]  crossed our southern border into a divided United States riddled with skyrocketing inflation
[1:04:16.760 --> 1:04:22.720]  and record homicides in sanctuary cities under democratic leadership. Now, Biden will issue
[1:04:22.720 --> 1:04:28.640]  ankle monitors and cell phones. Of course, Trump had been branded as inhumane for using
[1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:34.400]  ankle monitors. Meanwhile, Biden's massive payout to immigrant families has hit another
[1:04:34.400 --> 1:04:41.040]  snag. Can the United States endure three more years of United Nations puppet Joe Biden's
[1:04:41.040 --> 1:05:08.840]  destruction of American sovereignty? John Bown reporting.
[1:05:08.840 --> 1:05:13.560]  They're destroying our borders, our sovereignty, our supply chains, our language, our currencies.
[1:05:13.560 --> 1:05:18.360]  They're coming after us. And if we don't support American businesses, and if we don't support
[1:05:18.360 --> 1:05:24.280]  independent media in the final days of 2021, we have no future in the midterms in 2022.
[1:05:24.280 --> 1:05:30.280]  2022 is the year where America decides its fate. I want to thank you all for your support.

[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:52.920]  and operate the store and deal with all of the attacks on him continuously, it's incredibly

[1:07:43.960 --> 1:07:48.600]  You want to say shop local, right? I was going to say shop local. This is something I was
[1:07:48.600 --> 1:07:54.000]  going to tweet out until I got removed from Twitter. But thank God I have a platform where
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:59.400]  I can express myself without the approval of big tech censorship. But you want to say
[1:07:59.400 --> 1:08:03.160]  shop local, right? You don't want to be giving all your money to Target and Walmart and Amazon.
[1:08:03.160 --> 1:08:07.720]  You want to shop local, right? Unless you live in a place like Austin, you go to a local
[1:08:07.720 --> 1:08:13.200]  store here and it's like, hi, welcome to the Ruth Bader Ginsburg biography section of the
[1:08:13.200 --> 1:08:19.400]  bookstore. Would you like a Black Lives Matter pin? It's just like, oh God. You try to shop
[1:08:19.400 --> 1:08:24.200]  local and it turns out your local store is infested. It's a cult headquarters and you're
[1:08:24.200 --> 1:08:28.480]  contributing to them by shopping there. So hey, maybe don't shop local if you live in
[1:08:28.480 --> 1:08:33.680]  a liberal place because they're awful. Instead, go to infowarsstore.com. It's like nowhere
[1:08:33.680 --> 1:08:38.960]  else in the world can you guarantee that your money is going towards a good cause. Honestly,
[1:08:38.960 --> 1:08:43.480]  it's like you know where it goes to because we do broadcast every day because we have
[1:08:43.480 --> 1:08:47.000]  the American Journal and the War Room and the Alex Jones show because we've got Band-Aid
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:53.240]  video and Greg Reese and John Bown and Brian Wilson and Christie Lay. I mean, we have everything.
[1:08:53.240 --> 1:09:01.800]  You know where it's going and so go to infowarsstore.com and don't give your money to the weirdo liberal
[1:09:01.800 --> 1:09:06.560]  bookstore down the street. I'm going to do a whole report on it. It's just crazy. It's
[1:09:06.560 --> 1:09:14.080]  a true cult. I got to wonder if people just think it's normal, all of this like, you know,
[1:09:14.080 --> 1:09:18.560]  you want to talk about politicization of things. I walk into my local bookstore. It's
[1:09:18.560 --> 1:09:21.960]  like the local Barnes & Noble. It's a big bookstore. It's not like a far left bookstore.
[1:09:21.960 --> 1:09:28.640]  It's a big mainstream bookstore here in Austin called Book People. I'll just say it. It's
[1:09:28.640 --> 1:09:33.200]  like walking into a cult headquarters. It's like on the first table that you see, it's
[1:09:33.200 --> 1:09:37.760]  the how to be anti-racist section and we have all of the books telling white people
[1:09:37.760 --> 1:09:42.640]  that they're bad and how to stop being white. Okay, that's the first section we go to. Then
[1:09:42.640 --> 1:09:48.040]  over here we have, you know, the gift book section and there we have books by Obama and
[1:09:48.040 --> 1:09:52.680]  Anthony Fauci and Nancy Pelosi and it's just, and then you go to the biography section and
[1:09:52.680 --> 1:09:56.240]  it's like there's like three or four books. It's like George Washington and all of like
[1:09:56.240 --> 1:10:00.960]  James Madison's book over here, maybe like an FDR, you know, biography over here. The
[1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:06.200]  rest of the biographies are living democratic politicians. Like it's insane. It's, it's
[1:10:06.200 --> 1:10:09.920]  very, very weird. It's the same thing with like Netflix too. You go to documentaries
[1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:17.600]  and it's like Fauci, a story of love, the Obamas, gorgeousness in, in life. You know,
[1:10:17.600 --> 1:10:21.920]  it's just like, what is going, like why are they so obsessed with all these people? Why
[1:10:21.920 --> 1:10:26.280]  are they so, like why do they worship them like that? I remember Alex Jones one time
[1:10:26.280 --> 1:10:30.920]  using the term priest class that they were trying to establish a priest class. I didn't
[1:10:30.920 --> 1:10:34.600]  really get it at the time. It's one of those things that, that then you, it sticks in your
[1:10:34.600 --> 1:10:37.400]  head and you start seeing Evan and you're like, oh, they really are creating a priest
[1:10:37.400 --> 1:10:41.920]  class, but it's more than that. They're setting themselves up as like dimmy gods. It's very
[1:10:41.920 --> 1:10:45.440]  weird. You go to like, you just go to Barnes and Noble or anything. Go to the kids section
[1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:51.280]  at Barnes and Noble. It's 100. It's like the anti-racist baby. It's just like all of this
[1:10:51.280 --> 1:10:57.200]  racist stuff and all of this COVID stuff and all, it's just like, can I get a book about
[1:10:57.200 --> 1:11:02.080]  Clifford? Can I get a book about just like kids having an adventure in the woods? Like
[1:11:02.080 --> 1:11:07.560]  oh, sorry. You have to have a book about why your baby is a racist. Okay. Cause we're,
[1:11:07.560 --> 1:11:12.200]  it's called progress and you're in a cult. You're in a cult by the way. You support Trump.
[1:11:12.200 --> 1:11:16.600]  That's cause you're a cult member and you're in the cult of Trump, but also have you worshiped
[1:11:16.600 --> 1:11:21.200]  at the shrine of Black Lives Matter today? Have you, are you wearing your Ruth Bader
[1:11:21.200 --> 1:11:26.000]  Ginsburg pin? Could you name a single thing that she's ever done in her life or are you
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  just a trendy idiot that thinks Ruth Bader Ginsburg is somehow someone to be celebrated
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:39.480]  more so than any other member of the Supreme Court? It's insane. So yeah, long little ramble
[1:11:39.480 --> 1:11:43.680]  to go on, but I was literally just walking through this bookstore just like, what is
[1:11:43.680 --> 1:11:49.400]  going on? This is not normal. It's not normal folks. It's always just like the shoe on the
[1:11:49.400 --> 1:11:52.840]  other foot, right? Like you always just wonder like, what, what would their perspective be
[1:11:52.840 --> 1:11:58.880]  of this? Like if you just went into a Barnes and Noble in Houston and it was just like
[1:11:58.880 --> 1:12:03.960]  on every table, it was books about Trump and in every shelf, it was biographies of Trump
[1:12:03.960 --> 1:12:08.480]  and every kid's book was a kid's book about Trump and everything was about Trump. You'd
[1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:12.720]  be like, this is weird. This is a cult that I'm in. They don't even notice. They think
[1:12:12.720 --> 1:12:18.440]  it's totally normal and just, this is what you do in America. You worship your politicians
[1:12:18.440 --> 1:12:23.120]  like they're gods, the living politicians. I get worshiping the founding father, not
[1:12:23.120 --> 1:12:27.400]  worshiping, but like, you know, treating the founding fathers, treating like historically
[1:12:27.400 --> 1:12:34.280]  important people with the reverence that they deserve. But like, it's just like Nancy Pelosi.
[1:12:34.280 --> 1:12:39.000]  It's just like some dirtbag witch that's made hundreds of millions of dollars selling
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:43.920]  out this country and standing for absolutely nothing her whole life. And they treat her
[1:12:43.920 --> 1:12:50.600]  like she's Jesus Christ. Come back. Like it's, yeah, this type of stuff, you know, shop
[1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:55.680]  local everyone and you go local and it's like, have you checked out our RGB mug section?
[1:12:55.680 --> 1:13:02.880]  We have a whole section of mugs about Ruth Bader Ginsburg. We should do a segment where
[1:13:02.880 --> 1:13:06.080]  we go around and like, try to find people with shirts that have like Ruth Bader Ginsburg
[1:13:06.080 --> 1:13:11.600]  on them and just be like, can you say a quote of hers? They have no idea. They have no idea
[1:13:11.600 --> 1:13:15.440]  who she is. They have no idea what she represents or what she supports or anything like that.
[1:13:15.440 --> 1:13:18.560]  It's a little bit different. Like if you were to go ask somebody who was maybe wearing a
[1:13:18.560 --> 1:13:22.480]  Ron Paul shirt and be like, what's a Ron Paul position that you enjoy? And they'll be like,
[1:13:22.480 --> 1:13:26.900]  how much time do you have? How much time? I can quote his whole book by memory. Would
[1:13:26.900 --> 1:13:32.640]  you like to hear it? Like there's real substantive political support. And then there's just like
[1:13:32.640 --> 1:13:38.560]  trendy weirdness where they just like put Ruth Bader Ginsburg's head on their sweater.
[1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:43.560]  And there it is, the notorious RBG. People will wear this shirt and you can ask them.
[1:13:43.560 --> 1:13:49.200]  You can ask them, what has, what did RBG be? What did RBG do? What did she support? What
[1:13:49.200 --> 1:13:55.680]  is one of her beliefs? They have no idea. No idea. They're just trendy. They're just
[1:13:55.680 --> 1:13:59.040]  trendy little cult members and it's amazing. Okay. All right. So when we get back on the
[1:13:59.040 --> 1:14:03.440]  other side, I'm going to cover this story in detail from m4s.com. COVID cases continue
[1:14:03.440 --> 1:14:09.360]  to fall significantly in South Africa, but you should still be scared. You should still
[1:14:09.360 --> 1:14:14.400]  be incredibly scared. That classic American quote, I think you'll all remember, we have
[1:14:14.400 --> 1:14:20.920]  nothing to fear, but Omicron and COVID and your neighbors and the air and the winter
[1:14:20.920 --> 1:14:29.680]  and meat and cows and cars, big cars in China and Russia. Do you fear Russia? Are you scared
[1:14:29.680 --> 1:14:35.000]  of Russia and Republicans and white nationalists and white supremacists and white people in
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:40.220]  general? It turns out we have a lot of things to fear folks. Fear itself is pretty far down
[1:14:40.220 --> 1:14:46.280]  the list actually. It's actually extremely useful for us. They're desperate to create
[1:14:46.280 --> 1:14:51.240]  the fear. Are you scared yet? Are you frightened yet? Do we need to have Anthony Fauci go out
[1:14:51.240 --> 1:14:55.960]  and try to scare you some more? We're just here like, Hey, maybe don't be scared. Maybe
[1:14:55.960 --> 1:15:00.920]  just look at the facts on the ground and then make your opinion on that. And they're like,
[1:15:00.920 --> 1:15:05.320]  How about this? How about be scared and then we'll make up whatever we need to to justify
[1:15:05.320 --> 1:15:12.880]  your scaredness. And once you're scared, just give us control of your life. That's the
[1:15:12.880 --> 1:15:18.600]  solution. No, but it's wild. And he's comparing this, of course, to the United Kingdom. COVID
[1:15:18.600 --> 1:15:23.680]  cases in South Africa, the epicenter of the Omicron outbreak have continued to fall rapidly
[1:15:23.680 --> 1:15:27.600]  despite other governments pressing the panic button over the new variant. Having already
[1:15:27.600 --> 1:15:32.000]  imposed plan B restrictions, the UK government and others on the continent are considering
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:37.920]  even more draconian measures to stop a tsunami of Omicron cases. I covered this on war month
[1:15:37.920 --> 1:15:41.400]  Friday when I was sitting in for Owen, but literally we're comparing headlines over like
[1:15:41.400 --> 1:15:46.400]  first Omicron case in the UK actually turns out he didn't die of Omicron. He died with
[1:15:46.400 --> 1:15:52.480]  Omicron. So still zero deaths in the UK as of Omicron. The next headline 75 million deaths
[1:15:52.480 --> 1:15:58.880]  expected from Omicron by January. Are you scared yet? Are you fearful? So this could
[1:15:58.880 --> 1:16:04.800]  be literally your last chance with all the insane things happening in the world to get
[1:16:04.800 --> 1:16:11.200]  enforced products and to support us into 2022, the do or die year, store wide free shipping,

[1:16:56.160 --> 1:17:06.360]  It's hard to believe that Christmas 2021 is here and soon will be in the year 2022. Everything
[1:17:06.360 --> 1:17:16.840]  the globalist plan on doing their entire operations hinge on you psychologically not understanding
[1:17:16.840 --> 1:17:22.760]  that they're trying to break your will that they're trying to drive you into submission.
[1:17:22.760 --> 1:17:28.440]  But if you're aware of this basic fact and how they are scientifically controlling you
[1:17:28.440 --> 1:17:34.880]  then you're basically immune. This is next level information on how to take control of
[1:17:34.880 --> 1:17:38.720]  your mind. It's how I've been able to stand against the incredible attacks they've carried
[1:17:38.720 --> 1:17:45.680]  out because I'm able to connect to the divine. I'm able to transcend this dimension simply
[1:17:45.680 --> 1:17:51.120]  by becoming aware of the fact that I already transcended it. So until Christmas day, we're

[1:19:46.840 --> 1:19:50.520]  the middle of nowhere where regular phones don't work. They work info wars phone.com
[1:19:50.520 --> 1:20:02.120]  or 941 955 1029 4195 1020 and ask the Alex Jones special leading a frontal assault on
[1:20:02.120 --> 1:20:20.240]  the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones. Folks, the narrative is live. Are you
[1:20:20.240 --> 1:20:27.120]  scared yet? Are you ready to surrender your last freedoms to the psychopaths or do they
[1:20:27.120 --> 1:20:34.640]  need to frighten you more? Countries and city or states and cities around the country, countries
[1:20:34.640 --> 1:20:41.640]  around the world are imposing new and even more draconian lockdown orders in response
[1:20:41.640 --> 1:20:49.160]  to the very scary sounding Omicron variant. Sounds scary, doesn't it? It must be. Of course
[1:20:49.160 --> 1:20:53.080]  it's not and none of this is justified by anything, but Muriel Bowser has now declared
[1:20:53.080 --> 1:21:00.480]  a state of emergency in Washington, D.C. Other cities and counties are imposing new mask mandates
[1:21:00.480 --> 1:21:07.840]  and new lockdowns. They're being even more strict about vaccine mandates. Of course,
[1:21:07.840 --> 1:21:14.360]  none of this is based on anything scientific whatsoever, not even a little bit. Even buy
[1:21:14.360 --> 1:21:19.800]  even a almost call them Biden. Why shouldn't I write Trump says you're playing right into
[1:21:19.800 --> 1:21:29.000]  their hands if you doubt the COVID-19 vaccines? Which is a dumb thing to say. That's what
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:36.120]  I'll say about that. What a dumb thing to say. What a disappointment. Here's a story
[1:21:36.120 --> 1:21:40.800]  from infowars.com. I apologize, Watson. COVID cases continue to fall significantly in South
[1:21:40.800 --> 1:21:47.560]  Africa comparing the response of the U.K. government to the oncoming threat of Omicron
[1:21:47.560 --> 1:21:51.920]  to what is actually happening with Omicron, saying that COVID cases in South Africa, the
[1:21:51.920 --> 1:21:56.120]  epicenter of the Omicron outbreak, have continued to fall rapidly despite other governments
[1:21:56.120 --> 1:22:00.880]  pressing the panic button over the new variant. Let's take a look now at the U.K. pressing
[1:22:00.880 --> 1:22:05.120]  that panic button and then sort of being forced to admit that, OK, so it's not as bad as
[1:22:05.120 --> 1:22:12.000]  I'm making it out to be, but you should still be scared. Let's watch.
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:17.040]  Can you just tell us at this stage how many people are in hospital this morning with Omicron?
[1:22:17.040 --> 1:22:26.280]  There's 774. In hospital? Oh, sorry. That's total hospital hospitalization in the last
[1:22:26.280 --> 1:22:33.040]  seven days. With Omicron, there's 10 cases with Omicron. Maybe going up to 11, actually,
[1:22:33.040 --> 1:22:39.920]  that wasn't confirmed. Oh, no. Probably going up to 11. Oh, no, not 11. How many deaths?
[1:22:39.920 --> 1:22:50.080]  The deaths were 100. Oh, I don't have the... Omicron, lady. Omicron. Oh, sorry, K. No,
[1:22:50.080 --> 1:22:54.920]  we don't have... We've had one death with Omicron. Oh, do you see how...
[1:22:54.920 --> 1:22:58.680]  And how many of those 10 people... She's not specifically who she was when she said that.
[1:22:58.680 --> 1:23:02.040]  With Omicron. We've had one death. I don't think there's anybody with Omicron.
[1:23:02.040 --> 1:23:07.040]  I'm aware of on a ventilator with Omicron. OK. Professor Whitty saying people should
[1:23:07.040 --> 1:23:11.640]  be prior. So what you're getting at is the severity of the... You're getting at the severity
[1:23:11.640 --> 1:23:14.960]  of the disease, which is one of the unknowns. That's all those 10 people in hospital once
[1:23:14.960 --> 1:23:21.800]  and died. The other 10 are not on ventilators. Those are facts. Yeah, they're cranking it
[1:23:21.800 --> 1:23:29.960]  up to 11, folks. Watch out. 11 in the hospital with Omicron, maybe, but actually they're
[1:23:29.960 --> 1:23:34.520]  there for something else, but they did test positive. You notice how specific she was,
[1:23:34.520 --> 1:23:43.840]  right? She was asked how many deaths from Omicron. And she said, we've had one with Omicron.
[1:23:43.840 --> 1:23:49.080]  Like that was her emphasis, with Omicron. They didn't die from Omicron. They died with
[1:23:49.080 --> 1:23:55.640]  Omicron. So you get the headlines, first Omicron death in the U.K. It has begun. The title
[1:23:55.640 --> 1:23:59.400]  wave has arrived, but it's a lie. It's fabricated on a lie. It's based on a lie. And you have
[1:23:59.400 --> 1:24:04.040]  to read the article and you have to look at where they say died with COVID rather than
[1:24:04.040 --> 1:24:11.300]  from COVID. The media is engaged in a very, very specific game. It's how to tell the truth
[1:24:11.300 --> 1:24:16.880]  and leave the person with the impression of a lie, right? It's true. Somebody did die
[1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:21.240]  with Omicron, but they want you leaving with the impression that they died from Omicron.
[1:24:21.240 --> 1:24:24.880]  They just have to word it in a way that leaves you with that impression while covering their
[1:24:24.880 --> 1:24:31.960]  own butts by printing exactly what is true. Having already imposed plan B restrictions,
[1:24:31.960 --> 1:24:35.280]  the article from Info Wars goes on, the U.K. government and others on the continent are
[1:24:35.280 --> 1:24:41.400]  considering even more draconian measures to stop a tsunami of Omicron cases. However,
[1:24:41.400 --> 1:24:46.120]  yet more data out of South Africa suggests they are engaging in an incredibly alarmist
[1:24:46.120 --> 1:24:53.120]  overreaction. Here shows the percentage rates dropping over the course of a week. As we
[1:24:53.120 --> 1:24:58.840]  highlighted earlier, health authorities in South Africa have come, have suggested, wait,
[1:24:58.840 --> 1:25:02.880]  have even suggested stopping, tracing and quarantining those who've come into contact
[1:25:02.880 --> 1:25:06.160]  with Omicron because it isn't helping to stop the spread of the variant, which only causes
[1:25:06.160 --> 1:25:14.160]  mild symptoms anyway. Last week, South Africa Health Minister Joe Fahala said only 1.7%
[1:25:14.160 --> 1:25:19.240]  of COVID cases in the current Omicron wave are being hospitalized compared to 19% in
[1:25:19.240 --> 1:25:23.880]  the previous wave. If the people who were running our countries and the people who were
[1:25:23.880 --> 1:25:30.320]  our health authorities actually cared about people and actually wanted to get over this
[1:25:30.320 --> 1:25:35.000]  pandemic, wanted to get back to normal, if their goal was the cessation of all of these
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:39.800]  lockdowns and whatever, this would be great news. They would be shouting this from the
[1:25:39.800 --> 1:25:46.280]  rooftops. They'd be saying, everybody, it's going to be okay. Omicron, the mutation has
[1:25:46.280 --> 1:25:51.080]  shown that it's maybe transmissible, but it's not nearly as deadly. So it's a good thing.
[1:25:51.080 --> 1:25:56.520]  It'd be a good thing if these people had souls, but they don't. They're power hungry psychopaths
[1:25:56.520 --> 1:26:02.000]  and so they'll take any piece of information that increases fear and they'll blast that
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:08.120]  out even if it's completely baseless, even if it's a model based on nothing, like they'll
[1:26:08.120 --> 1:26:12.280]  put it out because it creates fear because that's what they want. They want control.
[1:26:12.280 --> 1:26:17.460]  But if it's good news, they bury it and call it a conspiracy theory and claim you're politicized
[1:26:17.460 --> 1:26:22.440]  for bringing it up. There's the story from Info Wars. COVID cases continue to fall significantly
[1:26:22.440 --> 1:26:27.880]  in South Africa. There's some other big news stories here today. Alex Jones will be returning
[1:26:27.880 --> 1:26:34.240]  soon, but we'll get into some of this other stuff too. I just know some mornings, you
[1:26:34.240 --> 1:26:38.640]  know, you just wake up like I woke up and this is one of the first stories I read. New
[1:26:38.640 --> 1:26:43.840]  York legislation provides for indefinite detention of unvaccinated at governor's limb. And I
[1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:48.000]  know my first thought when I heard this, it's going to be a good episode of the Alex Jones
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:55.600]  show today. I can't wait to hear Alex Jones talk about this, this very modest proposal
[1:26:55.600 --> 1:27:04.760]  to simply imprison at a whim anybody who may one day potentially perhaps carry some sort
[1:27:04.760 --> 1:27:10.360]  of disease maybe indefinite detention. I mean, they don't even need to know the people's
[1:27:10.360 --> 1:27:16.240]  name. It's really incredible. So we'll hear Alex Jones go off about that. I'm sure later
[1:27:16.240 --> 1:27:19.240]  in the program, you can support everything we do here by going to infowarsstore.com.
[1:27:19.240 --> 1:27:23.200]  When we get back on the other side, I'll get in a little bit more into this story. San
[1:27:23.200 --> 1:27:28.720]  Francisco mayor declared state of emergency in response to drug overdose death. This on
[1:27:28.720 --> 1:27:33.760]  the heels of the latest piece of information that says fentanyl is now the leading cause
[1:27:33.760 --> 1:27:43.200]  of death in Americans aged 18 to 45. The number one cause of death of Americans 18 to 45 is
[1:27:43.200 --> 1:27:50.440]  fentanyl. We doing anything to stop that? We doing just a single thing to stop that?
[1:27:50.440 --> 1:27:55.720]  It's more deadly than COVID by far, far, far, far more deadly for Americans fentanyl than
[1:27:55.720 --> 1:28:02.520]  COVID. We closing the border yet. We doing anything to stop this or sort of like everything
[1:28:02.520 --> 1:28:09.160]  else in this Godforsaken world. Is this the direct consequence of liberal policies? Yeah,
[1:28:09.160 --> 1:28:15.320]  I think it is. San Francisco mayor is very shocked. She's shocked and concerned to find
[1:28:15.320 --> 1:28:20.180]  out that after allowing people to inject drugs on the streets without arresting them after
[1:28:20.180 --> 1:28:25.640]  giving needles to homeless people so they can inject drugs after just opening up entire
[1:28:25.640 --> 1:28:33.880]  swaths of her city to be lawless drug dens that there's overdoses in San Francisco. What?
[1:28:33.880 --> 1:28:39.400]  It's like, do we need to have a lesson about the concept of cause and effect on this program?
[1:28:39.400 --> 1:28:44.560]  It's like, when you get rid of the police and crime explodes, that's your fault. And
[1:28:44.560 --> 1:28:50.200]  when you create your city into an open air drug den and then overdoses go through the
[1:28:50.200 --> 1:28:54.880]  roof, that's also your fault. These are things you caused, you idiots. And now they're trying
[1:28:54.880 --> 1:29:00.320]  to reverse them. We'll talk about it. Attention, radio listeners. So this could be literally
[1:29:00.320 --> 1:29:05.960]  your last chance with all the insane things happening in the world to get enforced products

[1:29:55.800 --> 1:30:05.800]  support. This could be in full Wars last Christmas because it could be America's last Christmas.
[1:30:05.800 --> 1:30:10.480]  Evil is taking over the planet. They're destroying our borders, our sovereignty, our supply chains,
[1:30:10.480 --> 1:30:15.320]  our language, our currencies. They're coming after us. And if we don't support American
[1:30:15.320 --> 1:30:20.480]  businesses and if we don't support independent media in the final days of 2021, we have no
[1:30:20.480 --> 1:30:27.840]  future in the midterms in 2022. 2022 is the year where America decides its fate. I want
[1:30:27.840 --> 1:30:31.520]  to thank you all for your support. I want to encourage you to your Christmas shopping
[1:30:31.520 --> 1:30:36.000]  and for store.com because I can barely keep our operation going. And I appreciate you
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:40.360]  keeping us in the position to fight back. I am so thankful for you. And I'm asking you
[1:30:40.360 --> 1:30:44.880]  now to realize the huge investment you made over the years in us, and I'll redouble your
[1:30:44.880 --> 1:30:50.960]  efforts to make sure that your investment in freedom continues on infowarstore.com has
[1:30:50.960 --> 1:30:56.200]  incredible products, store-wide free shipping up until December 20th. So please take action
[1:30:56.200 --> 1:30:57.880]  now and keep us on the air. Thank you.
[1:30:57.880 --> 1:31:05.280]  Get our great bag of it here. I mean, this is from people say, why is it from Chiapas,
[1:31:05.280 --> 1:31:09.400]  Mexico, the communists? Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's
[1:31:09.400 --> 1:31:14.960]  wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee. And yeah,
[1:31:14.960 --> 1:31:18.120]  we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really
[1:31:18.120 --> 1:31:21.880]  they're just a commune. And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got
[1:31:21.880 --> 1:31:25.040]  it. And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over. So I actually buy this
[1:31:25.040 --> 1:31:28.320]  from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never
[1:31:28.320 --> 1:31:32.360]  gone up. The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per
[1:31:32.360 --> 1:31:35.680]  pound. And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere. It's
[1:31:35.680 --> 1:31:41.000]  Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally. In fact, I'm going to tell
[1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:49.920]  you a little story. We had like that. You wouldn't believe it. Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com
[1:31:49.920 --> 1:31:53.280]  and that's how we fund this operation. And if you don't fund us and don't want to share,
[1:31:53.280 --> 1:31:54.280]  that's fine.
[1:31:54.280 --> 1:32:03.920]  I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball games. I like going to concerts. I
[1:32:03.920 --> 1:32:09.040]  like going to play golf. I like going out to dinner. I like the metropolitan life. I
[1:32:09.040 --> 1:32:14.120]  like everything that comes with this. But see, I have the survival instinct that is
[1:32:14.120 --> 1:32:20.000]  to get the hell out of Democrat run cities, get the hell out of major metropolitan areas.
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:24.240]  Because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down. Is it time to just move
[1:32:24.240 --> 1:32:28.240]  out to the woods, just time to go get a piece of property in the woods, just get off grid,
[1:32:28.240 --> 1:32:32.200]  just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the land? That's the survival instinct.
[1:32:32.200 --> 1:32:37.080]  See, the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says, no, no, no, no.
[1:32:37.080 --> 1:32:40.720]  Stay in the city. The survival instinct says, get the hell out of anywhere there, whatever
[1:32:40.720 --> 1:32:45.400]  notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask. That's the internal struggle that my
[1:32:45.400 --> 1:32:51.920]  guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well. But you can at least have some comfort
[1:32:51.920 --> 1:33:00.760]  if you have the emergency food supplies. And so we have the best ones at infowarstore.com.
[1:33:00.760 --> 1:33:06.360]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:06.360 --> 1:33:21.440]  All right, folks, they're seriously making their move and there is some bombshell information
[1:33:21.440 --> 1:33:29.320]  that needs to be shared here. And that's what M4s is all about. But a constant these days
[1:33:29.320 --> 1:33:38.360]  is that it's not just the failure of the leftist policies. It's not just the failure of liberal
[1:33:38.360 --> 1:33:44.320]  politicians. It's the fact that they'll acknowledge the failure but not their role in it. It's
[1:33:44.320 --> 1:33:53.000]  very confusing. You think when you implement a policy and that policy leads directly to
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  devastating consequences, that that person would feel some semblance of guilt over their
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:02.600]  policy. They would go, wow, we were really wrong about that. But it's like that doesn't
[1:34:02.600 --> 1:34:08.240]  exist in the liberal mindset. They just have this, I don't know if it's a narcissism or
[1:34:08.240 --> 1:34:14.600]  just an unearned confidence that they have. But like, this is all their fault. It's all
[1:34:14.600 --> 1:34:17.760]  their fault, right? Like you just look at the problems that we have in this country,
[1:34:17.760 --> 1:34:20.880]  the real problems, right? You ask liberal and leftists, and this is part of the issue.
[1:34:20.880 --> 1:34:27.480]  Like what are real problems in this country? They'll be like, probably white supremacy.
[1:34:27.480 --> 1:34:31.760]  That's probably the biggest problem is white supremacy. It's just like, oh, really? Here
[1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:35.560]  are the real problems. Our border is wide open and we're being invaded to the tune of
[1:34:35.560 --> 1:34:42.400]  several million a year, unknown foreigners coming into our country and escaping law enforcement.
[1:34:42.400 --> 1:34:47.560]  Here's a big problem. Inflation that has increased like 10% in a single year to the highest level
[1:34:47.560 --> 1:34:54.200]  in 40 years. Here's a problem, massive government spending that's bankrupting us. The COVID tyranny,
[1:34:54.200 --> 1:35:01.440]  the rampant lawlessness and crime wave that's leaving literally thousands of people a year
[1:35:01.440 --> 1:35:09.080]  dead, murdered, killed, life ruined, family destroyed. These are real problems. And every
[1:35:09.080 --> 1:35:16.160]  single one of them can be laid at the feet of liberals and leftists. They're directly
[1:35:16.160 --> 1:35:22.440]  attributable to policies that these people champion. Not oh, oops, accidentally, not
[1:35:22.440 --> 1:35:25.080]  oh, well, there were a bunch of good things, but yeah, there was this bad thing. It's like
[1:35:25.080 --> 1:35:31.280]  just nothing but badness, nothing but horror, nothing but chaos and destruction from these
[1:35:31.280 --> 1:35:35.800]  policies. And they don't, they don't even recognize it. It's that classic meme. It's
[1:35:35.800 --> 1:35:39.040]  the guy shooting the other dude in the chest and turning around with a smoking gun in his
[1:35:39.040 --> 1:35:44.360]  hand going, who could have done this? Who could have done this, Mayor Breed? San Francisco
[1:35:44.360 --> 1:35:49.040]  Mayor declared state of emergency in response to drug overdose deaths. San Francisco Mayor
[1:35:49.040 --> 1:35:53.000]  London Breed on Friday declared a state of emergency in the city's Tenderloin neighborhood,
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:56.920]  an area that sits near city hall, and that officials have long said is rampant with drugs
[1:35:56.920 --> 1:36:01.680]  and crime in response to overdose deaths. The policy came just days after Breed promised
[1:36:01.680 --> 1:36:06.520]  aggressive crackdown on crime in her city, in which she specifically cited the Tenderloin
[1:36:06.520 --> 1:36:12.120]  as an area plagued by open air drug dealing crime and unsanitary conditions on the street.
[1:36:12.120 --> 1:36:17.280]  So again, I don't know how they get away with this. I don't know what is, has happened
[1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:22.840]  to the American people that we just don't have to brain cells to rub together anymore.
[1:36:22.840 --> 1:36:28.840]  It's just so obvious how this happens. This is from last week. San Francisco Mayor London
[1:36:28.840 --> 1:36:32.960]  Breed announces crackdown policies less tolerant of the bull crap that has destroyed our city,
[1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:40.160]  that she created, that she endorsed, that she championed. She was a defund the police,
[1:36:40.160 --> 1:36:43.960]  Democrat. She got rid of the police. She is the one that passed the bills that allowed
[1:36:43.960 --> 1:36:47.680]  the open air trading of drugs that said, we're going to stop punishing people for drugs.
[1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:50.320]  It's going to be a safe zone. We're going to fund you. We're going to give you clean
[1:36:50.320 --> 1:36:54.640]  needles so you can do drugs safely in the city. And we're not going to arrest criminals
[1:36:54.640 --> 1:36:59.280]  and we're no longer going to punish shoplifters. And then it's like, wow, a shopping plague,
[1:36:59.280 --> 1:37:05.240]  a shopping outbreak, wow, rampant lawlessness, rampant criminality, hey, drug overdoses to
[1:37:05.240 --> 1:37:12.000]  an epidemic degree. Wow, what could have caused this? And it'd be one thing if just, this
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:15.440]  was unexpected. It'd be one thing if like, ah, it seemed like a good idea, but gee,
[1:37:15.440 --> 1:37:18.640]  we did not realize it was going to turn out this way. But you've got to be a little bit
[1:37:18.640 --> 1:37:23.640]  of a problem when you're promoting this sort of stuff and you have people like Alex Jones
[1:37:23.640 --> 1:37:27.840]  and Harrison Smith and Owen Troyer on Info Wars going, hey, it's a bad idea. It's a bad
[1:37:27.840 --> 1:37:31.560]  idea. Hey, if you defund the police, there's going to be a crime wave. If you defund the
[1:37:31.560 --> 1:37:35.280]  police, there's going to be a crime wave. And they're like, shut up, you're an idiot.
[1:37:35.280 --> 1:37:39.680]  You don't know anything. They defund the police. There's a crime wave. And they're like, whoa,
[1:37:39.680 --> 1:37:44.920]  we didn't know what he knew. Nobody could have seen this coming. It's a total surprise
[1:37:44.920 --> 1:37:52.120]  to us. So infuriating. In 2020, the city of San Francisco experienced 700 drug overdose
[1:37:52.120 --> 1:37:56.760]  deaths, Breed said, and more than 600 people have died from overdoses this year alone.
[1:37:56.760 --> 1:38:00.600]  In San Francisco on Tuesday, she announced a series of crime fighting initiatives to
[1:38:00.600 --> 1:38:05.240]  combat a wave of organized retail thefts, crime and sales of stolen goods. She know
[1:38:05.240 --> 1:38:10.480]  that San Francisco is a compassionate city, but not a city where anything goes. No, obviously
[1:38:10.480 --> 1:38:16.040]  not. You can't be a Trump supporter there. You can't, you can't be pro life there. It's
[1:38:16.040 --> 1:38:21.000]  not anything goes in San Francisco. It's that chaos and anarchy and death and destruction
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:30.920]  go in life and goodness and Christianity are not available there in San Francisco. It's
[1:38:30.920 --> 1:38:37.920]  utterly infuriating these ridiculous idiots that are putting us through all of this. They're
[1:38:37.920 --> 1:38:41.520]  not suffering from this. They've got private security. Oh, and by the way, again, they sort
[1:38:41.520 --> 1:38:45.880]  of, they sort of bury it here a little bit. But you just got to ask questions for yourself.
[1:38:45.880 --> 1:38:52.240]  You just got to read these things and don't just take it in. Think about it for a second.
[1:38:52.240 --> 1:38:56.560]  On Tuesday, she announced a series of crime fighting initiatives to combat a wave of organized
[1:38:56.560 --> 1:39:04.200]  retail thefts, crime and the sale of stolen goods. The sale of stolen goods. Where are
[1:39:04.200 --> 1:39:06.880]  people selling things or selling things on the internet? How are they selling things
[1:39:06.880 --> 1:39:11.960]  by remaining anonymous? This is exactly what the corporations asked the Congress to do.
[1:39:11.960 --> 1:39:16.480]  I'm sure you saw last week where they said, the corporations, you know, the ones that
[1:39:16.480 --> 1:39:19.680]  gave, gave literally hundreds of billions of dollars that covered it on American Journal.
[1:39:19.680 --> 1:39:24.840]  We went through it. It was like the CEOs of Target and Best Buy and all these other stores
[1:39:24.840 --> 1:39:31.520]  are begging Congress to do something to stop the crime wave that's bankrupting their stores.
[1:39:31.520 --> 1:39:34.560]  And it's just that I just went through and it was like Target, tens of millions of dollars
[1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:39.040]  to Black Lives Matter. Best Buy, something like over a hundred millions of dollars to
[1:39:39.040 --> 1:39:44.960]  Black Lives Matter. They funded this. They perpetuated the lawlessness. They supported
[1:39:44.960 --> 1:39:50.720]  the politicians that promised to defund the police and to stop persecuting criminals,
[1:39:50.720 --> 1:39:58.880]  and now they're begging the Congress to fix the obvious consequences of the things they
[1:39:58.880 --> 1:40:04.280]  proposed. But they aren't saying, hey, let's go back. They aren't saying, hey, you know
[1:40:04.280 --> 1:40:09.680]  that thing that we did that caused all the problems? Let's undo that. That would be saying
[1:40:09.680 --> 1:40:14.160]  that they're wrong. No, what the corporations did was they wrote to Congress to say, there's
[1:40:14.160 --> 1:40:18.280]  too much anonymity on the internet. See, these people breaking into our stores and stealing
[1:40:18.280 --> 1:40:23.640]  things, they sell those things on the internet, and they avoid being caught by remaining anonymous.
[1:40:23.640 --> 1:40:27.680]  So now that we've defunded the police and allowed a crime wave to take place, now we
[1:40:27.680 --> 1:40:32.800]  want the government to come in and get rid of anonymity on the internet as a result.
[1:40:32.800 --> 1:40:35.560]  Literally. That's what they asked the Congress to do, and it sounds like that's what Mayor
[1:40:35.560 --> 1:40:44.120]  Breed helps them to do. Kind of like how the first thing, I think it was Mayor Breed that
[1:40:44.120 --> 1:40:49.480]  did it. There may have been in Oakland this happened, but when one of the first big high-profile
[1:40:49.480 --> 1:40:56.280]  shoplifting mobs occurred, did they reverse course on defund the police? Did they say,
[1:40:56.280 --> 1:41:00.600]  oh, maybe we actually should maybe punish criminals when they commit crimes and get caught?
[1:41:00.600 --> 1:41:05.800]  Of course not. They said, yeah, we're going to stop cars from driving by the stores now.
[1:41:05.800 --> 1:41:10.040]  We're going to put up barriers to prevent cars from driving to the stores. That would
[1:41:10.040 --> 1:41:14.920]  make sense if the chain of events went like this. If the chain of events went, there's
[1:41:14.920 --> 1:41:18.640]  nice stores that don't get robbed, and then you took away barriers, and you said, we're
[1:41:18.640 --> 1:41:22.440]  going to let cars go down the street, and suddenly there was a rash of shoplifting,
[1:41:22.440 --> 1:41:26.680]  and you'd be like, wow, okay, cause, effect, let's put those barriers back because clearly
[1:41:26.680 --> 1:41:31.640]  that was the solution. That's not what happened. The actual events went, we defunded the police,
[1:41:31.640 --> 1:41:39.520]  we hired prosecutors and DAs who refused to prosecute criminals, then crime exploded, and
[1:41:39.520 --> 1:41:44.320]  now we're putting barriers up to stop the cars from driving through. Any of this making
[1:41:44.320 --> 1:41:51.480]  sense? Any of this getting through? Are there still Americans with brains left, or are we
[1:41:51.480 --> 1:41:58.040]  just zombified idiots who can't figure out cause and effect? Cause and effect. You do
[1:41:58.040 --> 1:42:02.680]  this thing, this thing happens. Stop doing that thing. But no, that's very complicated
[1:42:02.680 --> 1:42:10.120]  for these people. It's very confusing. And so now we have the number one cause of death
[1:42:10.120 --> 1:42:16.280]  for American citizens, 18 to 45, is fentanyl, because they've opened the border, because
[1:42:16.280 --> 1:42:21.560]  they perpetuate this stuff, because they're in league with pharmaceutical companies that
[1:42:21.560 --> 1:42:26.760]  started the opioid epidemic. They are in league with China, who provides most of the fentanyl.
[1:42:26.760 --> 1:42:33.040]  It all goes directly back to them. And then the solutions for the problems they cause
[1:42:33.040 --> 1:42:38.120]  just cause more problems and make things worse, and certainly never address what they imposed
[1:42:38.120 --> 1:42:41.840]  on us in the first place. Folks, that's going to be it for me. It's been a pleasure and
[1:42:41.840 --> 1:42:45.120]  an honor to be here with you today. I'll be back tomorrow morning, 8 a.m. for the American
[1:42:45.120 --> 1:42:53.560]  Journal Band. I video imports.com. Alex Jones takes over on the other side and I can't wait.

[1:43:03.840 --> 1:43:10.680]  important information I've produced in 28 years on air. A lot of what's in the courses
[1:43:10.680 --> 1:43:16.760]  is known. A lot isn't. But it's my particular perspective in my definitions and my way of
[1:43:16.760 --> 1:43:20.880]  seeing the world. Doesn't mean it's perfectly right. As the Bible says, we all see through
[1:43:20.880 --> 1:43:27.000]  rose color darkly, but we've proven that we've got some of the clearest cutting edge discernment
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  out there. And I want you to have access to this information because you need these tools,
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:37.320]  in my experience at least, to stand for the globalists and not let them break your will.

[1:45:02.320 --> 1:45:06.040]  Granny Do Right. Granny Do Right. Thanks for holding her on the ear. Go ahead.
[1:45:06.040 --> 1:45:11.520]  Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and for all the
[1:45:11.520 --> 1:45:16.120]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded
[1:45:16.120 --> 1:45:21.960]  up with sunspots or H-spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your X2 for the last
[1:45:21.960 --> 1:45:29.360]  couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually. People think I'm 55 years old. And
[1:45:29.360 --> 1:45:33.320]  I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[1:45:33.320 --> 1:45:37.600]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started
[1:45:37.600 --> 1:45:42.560]  taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately. But, you know, over a period of time, I started
[1:45:42.560 --> 1:45:47.680]  noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket. This is working. This is wonderful. You know,
[1:45:47.680 --> 1:45:54.000]  I don't, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know. So anyway, it worked wonderfully
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:58.080]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:45:58.080 --> 1:46:03.720]  UN Run Contact Tracers aren't coming. They're here all over the world from Australia to
[1:46:03.720 --> 1:46:07.720]  the United States from Canada to Germany. These tyrants are tracking everything you
[1:46:07.720 --> 1:46:12.200]  do everywhere you go and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases, actually
[1:46:12.200 --> 1:46:17.440]  taking people away into the night to their facilities. And they're planning in the next
[1:46:17.440 --> 1:46:22.360]  year to expand their shield process where they come and take, quote, healthy people
[1:46:22.360 --> 1:46:26.200]  away and put them in facilities for their safety. This is nothing less than martial
[1:46:26.200 --> 1:46:31.080]  law. And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[1:46:31.080 --> 1:46:34.960]  many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government

[1:47:11.480 --> 1:47:19.360]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[1:47:19.360 --> 1:47:26.320]  so does he. Live from the infowarstore.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:26.320 --> 1:47:32.000]  Well, I really appreciate the great Harrison Smith. We normally host American Journal weekday
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:39.840]  mornings, 8am to 11am for sitting in for me. I was in my office getting ready for today's
[1:47:39.840 --> 1:47:45.000]  transmission and I just had so much work in front of me and so many important things going
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:51.120]  on that I had to deal with personally that I just called over to the studio just a hundred
[1:47:51.120 --> 1:47:56.200]  yards away or so and said, Harrison, I need you to host at least the first hour or so.
[1:47:56.200 --> 1:48:00.720]  Because I've got to take care of this business. And normally, my own private business would
[1:48:00.720 --> 1:48:06.040]  not be of importance to the news and to the listeners, but to explain myself just about
[1:48:06.040 --> 1:48:10.960]  the climate and where this country and the world is right now. This morning, I went ahead
[1:48:10.960 --> 1:48:19.480]  and made the decision that I'm going to take the fifth officially with the January 6 witch
[1:48:19.480 --> 1:48:25.720]  hunt 3.0, as Roger Stone calls it, and that also a lawsuit we've been working on for the
[1:48:25.720 --> 1:48:32.840]  last week will be filed against the committee today in Washington, DC. And it's a very lengthy,
[1:48:32.840 --> 1:48:38.000]  very detailed, not just declaration of the Fifth Amendment, but the frame of the press
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:43.480]  and the facts of the committee. It's not constituted correctly and that it didn't even follow the
[1:48:43.480 --> 1:48:47.760]  law on how many Republicans it's supposed to have on it. It's only got two. It's supposed
[1:48:47.760 --> 1:48:52.320]  to have at least five. I mean, a lot of really, really important things. And so I'm sitting
[1:48:52.320 --> 1:48:56.880]  there and they demanded the suit and updated it. And it's a long suit. So I had to read
[1:48:56.880 --> 1:49:02.000]  that. I'm like, well, I can't sign off on this till I've read it. So I had to read that.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:06.680]  And then it was 11 o'clock. I already told Harris to do that. But then I was doing some
[1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:10.280]  more accounting, something I haven't really done a lot of in the past. I just hope the
[1:49:10.280 --> 1:49:14.080]  money comes into fun things. And I said, boy, I better just stay over here for a while.
[1:49:14.080 --> 1:49:17.880]  So I just got done about 10 minutes ago going over that, because this is the place you built.
[1:49:17.880 --> 1:49:21.440]  This is the place you've kept on air. And I'll just be again, completely candid with
[1:49:21.440 --> 1:49:26.960]  you. That's my only gear that I don't like coming on air and plugging this and selling
[1:49:26.960 --> 1:49:32.360]  that and asking you for support, because that's not the position I like to be in. But we're
[1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:36.440]  not funded by George Soros or the globalists. We're funded by you. So we try to make it
[1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:40.600]  as good as possible with great products that make your life better. But with the supply
[1:49:40.600 --> 1:49:50.640]  chain breakdowns and inflation and all the rest of it, info wars will implode. And I just
[1:49:50.640 --> 1:49:56.960]  don't want to have the enemy win within three to six months. And it didn't matter that I
[1:49:56.960 --> 1:50:00.960]  sold a bunch of reset war courses or we sold that coin or all the rest of it. It's just
[1:50:00.960 --> 1:50:06.520]  not bringing enough money in because we have to have our own servers, our own infrastructure,
[1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:12.360]  our own systems, our own satellite uplinks, our own proprietary systems that we have to
[1:50:12.360 --> 1:50:19.600]  go out and have people build and make at every level from software to switches to everything.
[1:50:19.600 --> 1:50:23.120]  People don't understand that this is the future of oppression that is happening to us. And
[1:50:23.120 --> 1:50:27.800]  I'm not a victim. I'm in this fight. I've been in the fight 28 years and we've changed
[1:50:27.800 --> 1:50:32.720]  the world. I'll never give up. I'll never give in, but I could give out like an old
[1:50:32.720 --> 1:50:37.520]  horse. And sometimes that sounds actually great. But then I see how evil the globalist
[1:50:37.520 --> 1:50:42.120]  are and how they're canceling Christmas officially with what he's going to announce tomorrow
[1:50:42.120 --> 1:50:47.720]  and just the rest of this cult's evil. And it makes me want to fight harder than ever.
[1:50:47.720 --> 1:50:52.280]  I need to be covering this news. So I will host the third and fourth hour today. I appreciate
[1:50:52.280 --> 1:50:55.520]  you're also going to usually host them before, but since so there's a lot to cover, I will
[1:50:55.520 --> 1:51:02.520]  be hosting that. And I intend to launch more shows and I intend to fight as hard as I can.
[1:51:02.520 --> 1:51:09.240]  And we're working with others to build infrastructure for the massive next level of deplatforming.
[1:51:09.240 --> 1:51:13.720]  It's going to be the blocking of URLs, the delisting of URLs that's going to happen right
[1:51:13.720 --> 1:51:18.760]  before the midterms and guaranteed they're going to do that. Okay. And they're going
[1:51:18.760 --> 1:51:22.400]  to stage terror attacks and they're going to do everything else and blame us. Do you
[1:51:22.400 --> 1:51:26.320]  understand? They will say on the news that my followers blow up the Pfizer building or
[1:51:26.320 --> 1:51:30.360]  something like that. And I'm saying, of course, don't do that. But I mean, I know, I know
[1:51:30.360 --> 1:51:34.480]  I see over the horizon. I know what the enemy's next moves are. And the most frustrating part
[1:51:34.480 --> 1:51:39.360]  is I'm happy and ready to go into battle politically and put my life on the line and
[1:51:39.360 --> 1:51:44.240]  my name and everything else with the coming false flags and the cyber attacks. But I need
[1:51:44.240 --> 1:51:48.920]  the listeners to really click in here and understand they're coming for you. Do you
[1:51:48.920 --> 1:51:52.920]  understand that? This is very, very real. There's a lot of stuff going on behind the
[1:51:52.920 --> 1:51:56.960]  scenes that for a lot of reasons we're not going to tell anybody about because we don't
[1:51:56.960 --> 1:52:01.920]  want to give the enemy targeting information. Okay. But you've seen what they've done to
[1:52:01.920 --> 1:52:06.800]  Trump. You've seen how they go after all of his associates. And it's the same stuff
[1:52:06.800 --> 1:52:14.760]  here. So we are literally war torn. We are battered. We are punished. We are tortured.
[1:52:14.760 --> 1:52:19.560]  And quite frankly, I'm not worried about me because I understand it's the whole civilization
[1:52:19.560 --> 1:52:24.000]  coming down. They are injecting millions of children a week in the Western world with
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:29.840]  injections that erase their immune system and basically give you a form of AIDS, literal
[1:52:29.840 --> 1:52:38.680]  autoimmune collapse. So there's a paradox of I don't care about myself and I'm not
[1:52:38.680 --> 1:52:43.240]  even worried about my operation except we've got to keep the operation out there. And so
[1:52:43.240 --> 1:52:48.080]  that's my great frustration is I want to be focused on how they're attacking the American
[1:52:48.080 --> 1:52:51.680]  people and other people around the world and how we fight them and how we beat them and
[1:52:51.680 --> 1:52:57.440]  what's coming next. And instead I spend most of my time as they intended dealing with congressional
[1:52:57.440 --> 1:53:02.120]  subpoenas, it's not just one, all sorts of harassment of the Democratic parties, dirty
[1:53:02.120 --> 1:53:09.440]  tricks from men in black to you name it, messing with us, to so much other stuff happening
[1:53:09.440 --> 1:53:14.600]  that I just need listeners to understand. This isn't somebody out in their fishing boat
[1:53:14.600 --> 1:53:20.560]  in a hurricane comes in and they're just calling in SOSs to watch the Coast Guard helicopters
[1:53:20.560 --> 1:53:25.320]  fly around. I'm not calling the fire department and saying my house is on fire just to watch
[1:53:25.320 --> 1:53:30.560]  fire trucks pull up out front, okay? When I tell you that Info Wars needs you to take
[1:53:30.560 --> 1:53:34.200]  the most important clips of what we say and what we do and share them, I know you're already
[1:53:34.200 --> 1:53:37.880]  doing it, do it more. And I know people all over the country, the reports are pouring
[1:53:37.880 --> 1:53:41.840]  in, I meant to give an attention last night because you folks are awesome. People are
[1:53:41.840 --> 1:53:46.800]  literally going around with Alex Jones's right signs. People are doing demonstrations, people
[1:53:46.800 --> 1:53:50.400]  are painting on the sides of barns. I talked to one of the crew members and went and saw
[1:53:50.400 --> 1:53:57.760]  some of his Army buddies, South of San Antonio and I-35 over the weekend to go to a veterans
[1:53:57.760 --> 1:54:05.160]  barbecue and driving back, he saw giant containers, a mountain built of them and he shot by it
[1:54:05.160 --> 1:54:08.200]  so fast he didn't get a photo and he didn't turn around because sometimes there's not
[1:54:08.200 --> 1:54:17.480]  exits for 10 miles on South I-35. But he saw find the truth, infowars.com on the side of
[1:54:17.480 --> 1:54:22.680]  the road. So I wasn't just reading this on Twitter and getting emails, people saying,
[1:54:22.680 --> 1:54:28.080]  hey, I'm in Florida in Tampa and there's a guy with an Alex Jones writer signer, hey,
[1:54:28.080 --> 1:54:32.560]  I'm driving through the middle of the Ozarks in Missouri and I just saw on the side of
[1:54:32.560 --> 1:54:37.400]  a barn, infowars.com or hey, I'm in Southern California and somebody just spray painted
[1:54:37.400 --> 1:54:43.400]  it huge across the bridge. All those calls and emails and things came in and I saw examples
[1:54:43.400 --> 1:54:49.400]  on Twitter without even looking this weekend. It was just there and then last night I tried
[1:54:49.400 --> 1:54:58.120]  to go see Spider-Man where they admit that the whole villain is Alex Jones. There's
[1:54:58.120 --> 1:55:02.680]  snatch and grab robberies and shootouts at the mall we didn't know about so it's closed
[1:55:02.680 --> 1:55:09.400]  even though I bought tickets days before. No one told us and then I went with the Army
[1:55:09.400 --> 1:55:13.520]  guy and he said, oh, by the way, I was driving back yesterday in South San Antonio and saw
[1:55:13.520 --> 1:55:18.560]  this big giant mountain that said find the truth in infowars.com or something like that.
[1:55:18.560 --> 1:55:23.760]  And again, when I get up here and I tell people like that, I mean, I tell people this kind
[1:55:23.760 --> 1:55:28.720]  of stuff, it's not like I'm up here saying, oh, look, I'm the villain in the Spider-Man
[1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:35.080]  movie to impress you. They're coming after us, folks. They're not doing stuff like that
[1:55:35.080 --> 1:55:39.520]  and admitting the director. Yeah, this is an Alex Jones character who sits up here in
[1:55:39.520 --> 1:55:44.480]  a set like this saying buy my supplements. Yeah. And then he goes in lies about Spider-Man
[1:55:44.480 --> 1:55:49.760]  and does all this evil crap. Why do you think they do things like that to me? Because they
[1:55:49.760 --> 1:55:53.920]  know I've got their number and you've got their number and our guests have their number.
[1:55:53.920 --> 1:55:59.280]  So I'm going to say it again. I need everybody to go to resetwars.com. It's a great six plus
[1:55:59.280 --> 1:56:03.800]  hour course and, you know, George straight tickets, a couple thousand bucks of football
[1:56:03.800 --> 1:56:07.960]  games, five hundred to a thousand bucks. Yeah, the course is two hundred something dollars
[1:56:07.960 --> 1:56:12.040]  is twenty five percent off right now. And if we don't sell tens of thousands of these
[1:56:12.040 --> 1:56:17.240]  courses in the next few months, we will not be able to continue on. We need to make the
[1:56:17.240 --> 1:56:23.800]  money. Plus it's groundbreaking hardcore information about deprogramming your mind from the globalist
[1:56:23.800 --> 1:56:29.160]  control. So I'm not bitching at you. I'm simply telling you, we're like a car driving through
[1:56:29.160 --> 1:56:32.600]  Death Valley. And if we don't get water put in the radiator, we're going to stall out
[1:56:32.600 --> 1:56:35.400]  and the engine is going to burn up. And then we're going to be in Death Valley together.
[1:56:35.400 --> 1:56:39.600]  Because you know what? We're all a big train together cruising through the wilderness. And
[1:56:39.600 --> 1:56:43.600]  we're all in this together. So I don't like sitting here like a baby bird begging for
[1:56:43.600 --> 1:56:47.680]  stuff all the time. OK, and part of me wants to just get wiped out and not have to deal
[1:56:47.680 --> 1:56:51.480]  with us anymore and have them shut us down and then you can fend for yourselves. But we
[1:56:51.480 --> 1:56:57.000]  got to keep fighting. We can't give up, ladies and gentlemen. So I need you to go to resetwars.com.
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:00.800]  Get a membership, see the film, review it, give us your take. I thank you for that. We
[1:57:00.800 --> 1:57:04.680]  also need folks to go to infowars.com. You need vitamin mineral fusion. You need DNA

[1:57:14.640 --> 1:57:20.520]  know, but I don't. Instead, some of our products have $45 worth of product in it. I mean, DNA
[1:57:20.520 --> 1:57:26.440]  Force Plus. I mean, this is real stuff. And I haven't cut corners, but I'm telling you,
[1:57:26.440 --> 1:57:30.000]  just like America's fighting for its life, Info Wars is fighting for its life. And we
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:34.520]  need your support at infowars.com cause I'm not going to give up, but I could give out.

[1:58:48.160 --> 1:58:56.440]  So here we are. The year 2021 is almost over. Christmas is just a few days away. I want to
[1:58:56.440 --> 1:59:01.440]  take a little bit of time out to thank you all for keeping us in the fight. The new world
[1:59:01.440 --> 1:59:06.360]  order would have already basically won if it wasn't for infowars. And I'm not bragging.
[1:59:06.360 --> 1:59:10.920]  I'm letting you know that together as a family, we have changed the world and that we have
[1:59:10.920 --> 1:59:16.440]  a responsibility because God put us in this position to not back down now at the very
[1:59:16.440 --> 1:59:21.080]  critical point. This is an info war and the globalists are trying to break your will and
[1:59:21.080 --> 1:59:26.520]  demoralize you and I've produced a two part course, mind wars, spirit wars, six plus hours

[1:59:44.680 --> 1:59:49.680]  and thanks for keeping infowars on the air.
[1:59:49.680 --> 2:00:16.680]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[2:00:16.680 --> 2:00:29.640]  The globalists have been bullying America forever. They have been slowly poisoning
[2:00:29.640 --> 2:00:36.240]  and brainwashing our people and dividing us and conquer us. But the reason I'll never
[2:00:36.240 --> 2:00:43.840]  give up is I know that good wins in the end and I also know that things get a lot worse
[2:00:43.840 --> 2:00:51.080]  if we give in and grease the skids for these psychos that are taking control of our lives.
[2:00:51.080 --> 2:00:59.440]  I have an absolutely insane stack of news here dealing with the new lockdowns that Biden
[2:00:59.440 --> 2:01:04.520]  is set to announce tomorrow and the horrible lockdowns around the world and the forced
[2:01:04.520 --> 2:01:09.720]  inoculations. That's coming up next segment. But that ties in with this disgusting Newsweek
[2:01:09.720 --> 2:01:19.800]  story. Children as young as four can now change gender in Scottish schools without parental
[2:01:19.800 --> 2:01:28.200]  consent. We're going to unpack that and what that really means on so many fronts. And then
[2:01:28.200 --> 2:01:35.800]  I was told that Jack Dorsey is this big free speech advocate and was secretly battling
[2:01:35.800 --> 2:01:41.200]  for freedom inside of Twitter and that he was really on my side. And I was told that
[2:01:41.200 --> 2:01:46.120]  by two very well-known prominent people three years ago during my platforming. I didn't
[2:01:46.120 --> 2:01:50.840]  believe it. So I guess when I went and screamed at him and chased him around Congress that
[2:01:50.840 --> 2:01:54.760]  last day when they were threatening to push him out of Twitter if he didn't ban me that
[2:01:54.760 --> 2:02:03.320]  I did the last straw. But I was naive in that I didn't want to be naive. I was let's just
[2:02:03.320 --> 2:02:10.040]  about saying Jack Dorsey is a heavenly character. But I didn't want to be naive. So then I just
[2:02:10.040 --> 2:02:16.760]  projected on everybody that everybody's bad and evil. But then a very well-known talk
[2:02:16.760 --> 2:02:24.240]  show host the top talk show host in the country talked to him and he said the same thing to
[2:02:24.240 --> 2:02:32.080]  him that Alex Jones is quote always right. And that basically Alex Jones is his guru.
[2:02:32.080 --> 2:02:37.520]  I found that pretty wild. And then the individual showed me a text message saying the same thing
[2:02:37.520 --> 2:02:43.480]  from Jack Dorsey. So I'm thinking this is getting really weird. And then I start having
[2:02:43.480 --> 2:02:47.520]  people reach out very prominent go you know Elon Musk knows you're right. And he's trying
[2:02:47.520 --> 2:02:51.120]  to figure out on the inside how to beat him. And then well let's just say some other interesting
[2:02:51.120 --> 2:02:56.560]  things happen. So info wars is right on the cusp. You were right on the cusp of massive
[2:02:56.560 --> 2:03:01.360]  victory. That's why we're in so much trouble. That's why they're going to declare martial
[2:03:01.360 --> 2:03:07.440]  law ahead of the election in 323 days. That's why everything is do or die right now. This
[2:03:07.440 --> 2:03:10.960]  is the moment where you're driving through the green light and you see the drunk driver
[2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:16.840]  going 100 miles an hour about to hit you. And everything goes into slow motion. This
[2:03:16.840 --> 2:03:25.480]  is the moment ladies and gentlemen that we better get right with Jesus because it's
[2:03:25.480 --> 2:03:29.960]  going down right now and that's the other big stack retired generals urged Pentagon
[2:03:29.960 --> 2:03:39.000]  to take steps to avert civil war in 2024 election. And I get so upset about this that it's hard
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:43.320]  for me to even talk about it because I know what's going to happen. I can see how the
[2:03:43.320 --> 2:03:49.160]  dominoes are going to fall. I think you can too. And it just makes me physically sick.
[2:03:49.160 --> 2:03:52.480]  You know a couple of weeks ago when I said you know according to my research most of
[2:03:52.480 --> 2:03:57.800]  the producers at CNN are pedophiles because they don't even let you in the club unless
[2:03:57.800 --> 2:04:01.400]  you are. You've got to be the worst type of person. And then of course they just busted
[2:04:01.400 --> 2:04:06.480]  another one doing the same stuff procuring children for sex ops. They're all want to
[2:04:06.480 --> 2:04:11.080]  be Jeffrey Epstein folks. He's like a Superman to them. Okay. And then of course it comes
[2:04:11.080 --> 2:04:14.320]  out. You think I want to just say that. You think I just say that about these people for
[2:04:14.320 --> 2:04:21.400]  no reason. You think I'm happy to have to take on these type of criminals. But honor
[2:04:21.400 --> 2:04:27.520]  and duty says I will do it. And so I am. I just want to go into this fight strong. And
[2:04:27.520 --> 2:04:30.840]  there's nothing worse than being in a fight. I'm using this as analogy not literal. But
[2:04:30.840 --> 2:04:35.640]  imagine you're at your post in a long term gun battle. Let's say during the Korean war
[2:04:35.640 --> 2:04:39.240]  and there's Chinese troops flooding in and your machine gun barrels are melting and you're
[2:04:39.240 --> 2:04:45.480]  out of ammo. Well now you fix bayonets. I mean I want this fight politically to have
[2:04:45.480 --> 2:04:49.880]  the best guns the best ammo the best fight. But I'll keep fighting politically however
[2:04:49.880 --> 2:04:59.760]  I have to hand to hand. But we need funds right now. We need your support reset wars.com.
[2:04:59.760 --> 2:05:05.560]  This could be in full wars last Christmas because it could be America's last Christmas.
[2:05:05.560 --> 2:05:10.120]  Evil is taking over the planet. They're destroying our borders our sovereignty our supply chains
[2:05:10.120 --> 2:05:15.080]  our language our currencies. They're coming after us. And if we don't support American
[2:05:15.080 --> 2:05:20.200]  businesses and if we don't support independent media in the final days of 2021 we have no
[2:05:20.200 --> 2:05:27.600]  future in the midterms in 2022. 2022 is the year where America decides its fate. I want
[2:05:27.600 --> 2:05:31.240]  to thank you all for your support. I want to encourage you to your Christmas shopping
[2:05:31.240 --> 2:05:35.720]  and for store.com because I can barely keep our operation going. And I appreciate you
[2:05:35.720 --> 2:05:40.080]  keeping us in the position to fight back. I am so thankful for you. And I'm asking you
[2:05:40.080 --> 2:05:44.600]  now to realize the huge investment you made over the years in us and I'll redouble your
[2:05:44.600 --> 2:05:50.680]  efforts to make sure that your investment in freedom continues on infowarstore.com has
[2:05:50.680 --> 2:05:55.920]  incredible products store wide free shipping up until December 20th. So please take action
[2:05:55.920 --> 2:06:22.760]  now and keep us on the air. Thank you. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones. Ladies
[2:06:22.760 --> 2:06:31.400]  and gentlemen we are back live now into our number three on this Monday December 20th
[2:06:31.400 --> 2:06:38.560]  global broadcast. Okay so we have the retired generals urge Pentagon to take steps to avert
[2:06:38.560 --> 2:06:46.720]  civil war 2024 election and the new term on ABC News and NBC News and the Wall Street
[2:06:46.720 --> 2:06:54.920]  Journal and the Atlantic Monthly and everywhere. Atlantic Monthly is the voice of Epstein.
[2:06:54.920 --> 2:07:00.960]  I mean they stopped calling it Atlantic Monthly. It's the voice of Epstein. Sorry. The voice
[2:07:00.960 --> 2:07:04.880]  of the blackmail ring is the voice of Satan. The voice of Steve Jobs widow that funds all
[2:07:04.880 --> 2:07:13.120]  this garbage to bring the country down. True piece of filth. Let's just decipher this headline.
[2:07:13.120 --> 2:07:21.840]  Our generals urge Pentagon to take steps to avert civil war in the upcoming elections.
[2:07:21.840 --> 2:07:27.640]  Now let's just decipher what they're really saying there and what that really means. Biden
[2:07:27.640 --> 2:07:40.520]  has generals under his control. Biden controlled generals call for martial law to suppress
[2:07:40.520 --> 2:07:47.760]  American people ahead of elections. But notice they spitted of oh we've got to stop the military
[2:07:47.760 --> 2:07:53.360]  taking over so we need the military to take over when you read the Washington Post op-ed
[2:07:53.360 --> 2:08:01.760]  article written by the three generals. Oh we need to have the CIA and FBI and NSA watch
[2:08:01.760 --> 2:08:08.440]  the American people and degrade. And they use all these military terms you use for
[2:08:08.440 --> 2:08:15.880]  taking people out. So that's how they operate ladies and gentlemen. And they do it over
[2:08:15.880 --> 2:08:23.720]  and over again. They're using all of these terms degrade and disrupt our networks. That
[2:08:23.720 --> 2:08:32.440]  is in the terrorism directive of June of this year. And I remember right after Biden first
[2:08:32.440 --> 2:08:38.360]  got in and Saki got up there in late January and she said we need the CIA and the military
[2:08:38.360 --> 2:08:43.120]  to take on these insurrectionists. And the new terror threat is the white people that
[2:08:43.120 --> 2:08:48.880]  attacked the Capitol and a white supremacist attack and those that question future lockdowns
[2:08:48.880 --> 2:08:54.080]  and those that question forced injections. And they were reading off the list they'd
[2:08:54.080 --> 2:09:02.720]  already been given by the deep state that he then codified into the regulations. And
[2:09:02.720 --> 2:09:14.280]  so Biden's surrogates call for martial law to protect us from a coup and actually say
[2:09:14.280 --> 2:09:23.720]  that in the article. And we got to degrade and disrupt these networks. Degrade and disrupt
[2:09:23.720 --> 2:09:30.160]  those are military terms for shutting people down putting them under siege putting sanctions
[2:09:30.160 --> 2:09:37.760]  on them killing them capturing them torturing them. We are literally here watching our occupied
[2:09:37.760 --> 2:09:42.600]  government with big tech censoring the people suppressing everyone and what is Trump doing
[2:09:42.600 --> 2:09:48.200]  during all this. And listen I got to go with my gut and just how I really feel on things.
[2:09:48.200 --> 2:09:53.640]  A lot of the people are Machiavelli they calculate to think about what will it do for them.
[2:09:53.640 --> 2:09:57.000]  I don't care about me at the end of the day I really care about the children what's going
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:10:01.880]  to get to next segment. In fact as we reprint me that article from Friday that Don Salazar
[2:10:01.880 --> 2:10:06.520]  wrote about the newborn baby bleeding out of every orifice and dying from the Moderna
[2:10:06.520 --> 2:10:16.040]  shots at birth. Thank you. I want people to understand that this is happening now. And
[2:10:16.040 --> 2:10:22.280]  that we're not in Kansas anymore. So I see Trump in these big rallies of 10,000 15,000
[2:10:22.280 --> 2:10:27.320]  20,000 30,000 with Bill O'Reilly and selling tickets which is fine cost a lot of money
[2:10:27.320 --> 2:10:34.800]  to rent those auditoriums and rent those stadiums and do that. But then he they just
[2:10:34.800 --> 2:10:39.960]  get up and everything's fine. Everybody's wonderful and look what an idiot Biden is
[2:10:39.960 --> 2:10:44.880]  and oh look here's Bill O'Reilly you know he he's making jokes and it's all about what
[2:10:44.880 --> 2:10:52.520]  movie stars they are. And Trump has lost a lot of weight looks good that's great but
[2:10:52.520 --> 2:10:59.200]  who cares about all that. We want to hear about the new world order we want to hear
[2:10:59.200 --> 2:11:03.080]  about build back better we want to hear about how it's a UN takeover we want to hear about
[2:11:03.080 --> 2:11:08.120]  how the global vaccine passport is being used to track and trace and control people
[2:11:08.120 --> 2:11:15.360]  out it'll be the basis of the global ID and social credit score now being put into place.
[2:11:15.360 --> 2:11:20.720]  Nothing out of Trump on that nothing out of Bill O'Reilly because they're still in the
[2:11:20.720 --> 2:11:27.440]  normal world of golf courses and private jets and helicopters and their supermodel wives
[2:11:27.440 --> 2:11:32.120]  and and and everybody goes like it's a big event but they're going to see a rock and
[2:11:32.120 --> 2:11:37.840]  roll band or they're going to see George straight. And I mean quite frankly we're people like
[2:11:37.840 --> 2:11:42.240]  George straight where are all the celebrities where are all the people that claim they're
[2:11:42.240 --> 2:11:49.920]  Americana they're nowhere to be seen. Just use George straight as an example. Well they
[2:11:49.920 --> 2:11:55.400]  don't see it as their role to do that you see so we've got this giant criminal takeover
[2:11:55.400 --> 2:12:02.280]  taking place and we've got a history tour with Trump and O'Reilly going around so they
[2:12:02.280 --> 2:12:17.360]  can pretend to be Elvis. And why am I pissed at Trump. Well here he is with O'Reilly just
[2:12:17.360 --> 2:12:23.920]  a few days ago. There's the headline on info wars dot com by Paul Joseph Watson. Trump
[2:12:23.920 --> 2:12:31.160]  you're playing right into their hands when you doubt the vaccine. Hey Trump I can read
[2:12:31.160 --> 2:12:36.040]  the studies they admit you have within six months with the Moderna and Pfizer shots less
[2:12:36.040 --> 2:12:42.120]  immunity than when you took it. It isn't a vaccine and we know we put you under major
[2:12:42.120 --> 2:12:50.000]  pressure to come out against it and your bullheaded response is to say we're playing into their
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:57.040]  hands. Oh the third fourth fifth seventh eighth ninth tenth shot and the vaccine passports
[2:12:57.040 --> 2:13:01.840]  that come with it and having to scan your your your phone to go in a business or get
[2:13:01.840 --> 2:13:11.200]  on a plane or and there's Trump acting like this isn't a problem. He should be talking
[2:13:11.200 --> 2:13:15.360]  about January 6th and how they wouldn't let him have the National Guard there. He should
[2:13:15.360 --> 2:13:18.720]  be talking about the FBI role and he knows all about it. He should be talking about
[2:13:18.720 --> 2:13:27.280]  the deep state and the New World Order. He should be talking about how many people are
[2:13:27.280 --> 2:13:32.080]  dying from these poison injections. Now the FDA is trying to suppress the documents for
[2:13:32.080 --> 2:13:38.280]  75 years. It was 55. Might as well be 75,000 years. And now the little bit of documents
[2:13:38.280 --> 2:13:43.200]  that came out show mass death and that they knew it and covered it up. The crime of the
[2:13:43.200 --> 2:13:51.520]  millennia of human history is happening. And is Trump on the right side of history? Absolutely
[2:13:51.520 --> 2:14:04.640]  not. And so with leaders like this we don't have much hope. It's very very sad. Here's
[2:14:04.640 --> 2:14:12.520]  Trump saying we're playing right into their hands if we don't take the shot. Oh, uh-huh.
[2:14:12.520 --> 2:14:16.760]  Right into big pharma, right into Bill Gates' hands when we don't let them put an experimental
[2:14:16.760 --> 2:14:21.560]  injection into us that we know is causing all hell to break loose. Trump could transcend
[2:14:21.560 --> 2:14:25.200]  left to right. He could come out and say he was wrong and they lied to him, put it all
[2:14:25.200 --> 2:14:30.040]  on Fauci, but instead he knows now. He signed on to it and he knows it's a big problem.
[2:14:30.040 --> 2:14:36.760]  So he's decided with us respectfully asking him to help save the children to say no, I'm
[2:14:36.760 --> 2:14:44.320]  not going to do that. And now he's joining the ranks of Chuck E. Schumer and Bill Gates.
[2:14:44.320 --> 2:14:50.000]  And that's a really sad thing. But Trump's always been a germaphobe. He's always been
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:54.080]  obsessed with doctors and he worships whatever they tell him and they sit there and tell
[2:14:54.080 --> 2:14:59.200]  him, oh sir, it's totally effective. It's totally safe. It works great. Really, is that
[2:14:59.200 --> 2:15:03.800]  why they tell all the people that have taken the shots? That they're sick because we didn't
[2:15:03.800 --> 2:15:07.560]  take it even though they're twice as likely to get sick or die if they've had it? And
[2:15:07.560 --> 2:15:11.840]  they've got all these good people under Stockholm syndrome who are buying into this. So I don't
[2:15:11.840 --> 2:15:18.360]  believe Trump is consciously doing this, but it doesn't matter. He's doing it. You know,
[2:15:18.360 --> 2:15:24.120]  the worst part of 15 days to flatten the curbs the first two years and we're about to complete
[2:15:24.120 --> 2:15:29.520]  our two years here in about a month. Isn't that nice? We're going into year three here
[2:15:29.520 --> 2:15:34.400]  and oh, by the way, I told you 20 months ago, I said, by year two, at the end of year two,
[2:15:34.400 --> 2:15:38.000]  by year three, they'll tell you it's permanent because I know these people and sure as hell
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:41.840]  it just happened. See, I'm not going to back down. I'm going to defend the children. I'm
[2:15:41.840 --> 2:15:46.320]  going to speak up against this mass murder of the Seville. And you know what? If Trump
[2:15:46.320 --> 2:15:50.120]  rode in on the wave of populism and the rest of it wants to get off that wave, great. They
[2:15:50.120 --> 2:15:53.640]  probably want to go to his glitter bug events and, you know, sit there. That's fine. But
[2:15:53.640 --> 2:16:01.280]  as for me, I'm going to be the winner. Soldiers, you're concerned about the power reset wars.com

[2:17:01.760 --> 2:17:08.720]  I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet. I've had a lot of loss. Everybody else has.
[2:17:08.720 --> 2:17:18.000]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:26.160]  and bled and sweat for. And now we're just throwing it all away. I see the general public
[2:17:26.160 --> 2:17:32.680]  in a medically induced, scientifically induced, behavioral psychologically controlled trance
[2:17:32.680 --> 2:17:39.480]  key. And I know we're being fed into this globalist beacons. And it's so incredibly sad. But this
[2:17:39.480 --> 2:17:46.280]  is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating collapsing
[2:17:46.280 --> 2:17:51.600]  and then coming back to life again. It's just the globalist are actively trying to steer
[2:17:51.600 --> 2:17:56.080]  and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we
[2:17:56.080 --> 2:18:01.440]  know it. I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[2:18:01.440 --> 2:18:06.680]  I wanted to stop their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their
[2:18:06.680 --> 2:18:12.120]  tracks before they went operational, but we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes,
[2:18:12.120 --> 2:18:17.440]  we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[2:18:17.440 --> 2:18:21.920]  deindustrialization, great reset. And that's why it's more important than ever that all
[2:18:21.920 --> 2:18:26.560]  viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready
[2:18:26.560 --> 2:18:30.480]  to wake up and ready to hear the truth. So we've got an information warfare, the enemy
[2:18:30.480 --> 2:18:34.360]  and trying to stop their agenda. We've also got to get personally prepared. And one of
[2:18:34.360 --> 2:18:37.840]  the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food. We've got the best food ready

[2:20:03.440 --> 2:20:30.200]  Jones.
[2:20:30.200 --> 2:20:50.080]  Yeah, they're not lies. They're all coming through. Yes, from the operator. All right.
[2:20:50.080 --> 2:21:11.040]  I'm not going to go off on a jag about Trump. I intended to get to that a little bit next
[2:21:11.040 --> 2:21:17.720]  hour, but it just makes me so sad. I feel so betrayed and I'm not throwing the baby
[2:21:17.720 --> 2:21:22.360]  out with the bathwater. They're trying to take Trump down as he's getting good nationalistic
[2:21:22.360 --> 2:21:29.320]  populist Republicans elected. And on 95% of the issues, he's great. But man, our children
[2:21:29.320 --> 2:21:34.360]  dying in mass, our children having major health problems, this injection, not protecting them,
[2:21:34.360 --> 2:21:40.600]  being a fraud. And him saying, Oh, it works wonderfully. Oh, just get it. Oh, and then
[2:21:40.600 --> 2:21:52.600]  he tells the Dallas crowd, Oh, I just got the booster. Go get the shot.
[2:21:52.600 --> 2:21:59.920]  Telling his constituents to take Fauci's poison. Bill Gates is venom. I'm gonna have to pray
[2:21:59.920 --> 2:22:10.440]  about this. But I may have to go to Trump events. I don't have the money. Hell, I follow him
[2:22:10.440 --> 2:22:15.840]  around the country and protest his ass. Because see, we know Chucky Schumer is evil. We know
[2:22:15.840 --> 2:22:23.040]  Bill Gates is super wicked. But I mean, really, Donald Trump, Donald Trump that hates the UN
[2:22:23.040 --> 2:22:27.080]  and hates the globalists doesn't trust the system. And said months ago, Pfizer's running
[2:22:27.080 --> 2:22:31.560]  scams trying to people have a booster. Why are they running that scam? Did he just say
[2:22:31.560 --> 2:22:37.680]  that? So they'd come to him and say, Hey, you know, we'll give Jared a billion bucks
[2:22:37.680 --> 2:22:44.040]  or something. If you just say that shots great. I mean, is he getting paid to do this?
[2:22:44.040 --> 2:22:50.160]  We should do a whole show asking what the hell's going on with Trump. I'm gonna stop
[2:22:50.160 --> 2:22:56.640]  right there. I got such important news to hit. And it's just, it's just, it just. But I guess
[2:22:56.640 --> 2:23:03.280]  we're entering 2022 2022 is the year 2022 is going to be so deciding. It's going to make
[2:23:03.280 --> 2:23:10.840]  every other year in your life look like child's play. I guarantee you. And we're only 11 days
[2:23:10.840 --> 2:23:28.480]  out right now. We're 11 days out from destiny right now. You know, I don't, I'm not going
[2:23:28.480 --> 2:23:33.840]  to turn and run from all this. I don't want to turn and run. I can't turn and run. But
[2:23:33.840 --> 2:23:38.960]  at the same time, watching everybody else sit there unconscious, not aware how much
[2:23:38.960 --> 2:23:43.520]  trouble we're all in collectively makes me want to just jump off a cliff. Not literally.
[2:23:43.520 --> 2:23:47.120]  I'm not going to kill myself. But you know what I mean? Jump off a cliff into a new country,
[2:23:47.120 --> 2:23:51.240]  a new place, new people. But here's the problem. I can't just jump through a portal to a new
[2:23:51.240 --> 2:23:57.200]  world because there is no new world. It's global government and the same crap everywhere.
[2:23:57.200 --> 2:24:02.640]  No matter where you go. And I get it. I get why a lot of people just want to dress up
[2:24:02.640 --> 2:24:07.440]  and go hear Trump speak with Bill O'Reilly and have fun and giggle and laugh at Biden.
[2:24:07.440 --> 2:24:15.240]  But laughing at Biden is laughing at ourselves. You don't see me laughing at Biden. That they
[2:24:15.240 --> 2:24:22.640]  put something like that in there to do this to our country and the world in our names.
[2:24:22.640 --> 2:24:28.240]  And I just look at my children, especially my four-year-old daughter. She's so good.
[2:24:28.240 --> 2:24:35.040]  She doesn't deserve to be governed and ruled by scum. And that there's armies of pedophiles
[2:24:35.040 --> 2:24:38.000]  they put in the major positions of power. And I'm going to get to that last segment of this
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:44.160]  hour. Big new developments there. I mean, it's just horrific. We need, here's the best analogy.
[2:24:45.040 --> 2:24:49.200]  You ever ate some bad fish or something and you're at, even before you leave the restaurant,
[2:24:49.200 --> 2:24:52.960]  your stomach's hurting and your mouth starts kind of watering. You go, oh, that's bad food.
[2:24:52.960 --> 2:24:58.080]  And you go throw it up and you beat the food poisoning. But everybody knows somebody that
[2:24:58.080 --> 2:25:01.920]  even if the food's bad, they just kind of hold it down. Not me. I never have food poisoning
[2:25:01.920 --> 2:25:06.560]  because the minute I start feeling it bad, I just go throw up. Probably only happens once a year or
[2:25:06.560 --> 2:25:11.600]  so. And the people that have been with me almost every time get sick if they ate the same thing.
[2:25:11.600 --> 2:25:16.400]  And that's, that's me, but I can't throw up. I need all of you. We, all of us need to decide
[2:25:16.400 --> 2:25:25.040]  to, this is bad. This is poisonous and reject Satan. Reject the new world order. Reject Hollywood.
[2:25:25.040 --> 2:25:32.560]  Reject it all because it's killing us. It is not fulfilling us. It is pure poison.
[2:25:33.760 --> 2:25:37.680]  And if we can't get President Trump, who is the real president, who wanted a landslide,
[2:25:38.240 --> 2:25:40.800]  if we can't get him on the most central of issues,
[2:25:43.840 --> 2:25:48.000]  that he's coming out saying, you need to take these shots. The only silver lining is,
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:53.760]  I don't make Democrats that hate him so much, not take it. Because even though Democrats are
[2:25:53.760 --> 2:26:00.720]  dumbed down and mind controlled and have their own problems, they don't deserve to die like this.
[2:26:01.280 --> 2:26:07.440]  And I know our children don't especially. So you got to explain to these people that the
[2:26:07.440 --> 2:26:11.520]  vaccine doesn't work. You got to explain to them they've been conned. You got to explain to them
[2:26:11.520 --> 2:26:18.320]  they've been lied to. And we've got to just rediscover God and come together. But I can
[2:26:18.320 --> 2:26:27.360]  just say this shame on President Trump. Shame on him. It's just disgusting. Here's the video.
[2:26:28.400 --> 2:26:35.520]  But look, we did something that was historic. We saved tens of millions of lives worldwide.
[2:26:35.520 --> 2:26:41.840]  We, together, all of us, not me, we, we got a vaccine done, three vaccines done,
[2:26:41.840 --> 2:26:46.320]  and tremendous therapeutics like Regeneron and other things that have saved a lot of lives.
[2:26:46.320 --> 2:26:53.280]  We got a vaccine done in less than nine months that was supposed to take from five to 12 years.
[2:26:53.280 --> 2:26:59.120]  Because of that vaccine, because of that vaccine, millions and millions of people,
[2:26:59.120 --> 2:27:04.960]  I think this would have been the Spanish flu of 1917, where up to 100 million people died.
[2:27:04.960 --> 2:27:11.280]  This was going to ravage the country far beyond what it is right now. Take credit for it. Take
[2:27:11.280 --> 2:27:16.080]  credit for it. It's a great, what we've done is historic. Don't let them take away. Don't take
[2:27:16.080 --> 2:27:20.400]  it away from ourselves. You're playing that, you're playing right into their hands when you
[2:27:20.400 --> 2:27:24.800]  sort of like, oh, the vaccine, if you don't want to take it, you shouldn't be forced to take it.
[2:27:24.800 --> 2:27:31.360]  No mandates. But take credit because we saved tens of millions of lives. Take credit. Don't
[2:27:31.360 --> 2:27:36.640]  let them take that away from you. Okay. So the president made new... You agree with that? Right?
[2:27:37.360 --> 2:27:42.640]  Oh, shelling in the evil eye. Just shut her out. I can't look at him. Okay, so
[2:27:42.640 --> 2:27:50.640]  let's break this down. Hey, Trump, you want us to take credit for this?
[2:27:50.640 --> 2:27:54.720]  Mom double jabbed in third trimester, gives birth to a baby who died or suffering
[2:27:54.720 --> 2:27:59.920]  health and heart failure, blood clots bleeding out of every orifice. You can go read the
[2:27:59.920 --> 2:28:05.840]  government VAERS report. Want me to take credit for that, Trump? Oh, millions, millions of lives.
[2:28:05.840 --> 2:28:09.280]  Is that why we've got way more, quote, COVID deaths this year than last? And the hospitals
[2:28:09.280 --> 2:28:12.800]  are actually full this time. They weren't last time. Is that why there's about to be a new lockdown?
[2:28:12.800 --> 2:28:16.640]  Is that why it's a permanent lockdown, a permanent new world order takeover with forced
[2:28:16.640 --> 2:28:25.600]  injections forever in the official UN plan? You're there trying to sell us on signing on to all of this.
[2:28:28.320 --> 2:28:32.400]  I don't care if you're a Republican. I don't care if you're a Democrat. I don't care who you are.
[2:28:32.400 --> 2:28:38.080]  Stop saying it's the science. Trust the science. They've lied every step of the way about the mask,
[2:28:38.080 --> 2:28:46.000]  about the so-called vaccine, about the immunity. They've demonized natural immunity. It's crazy.
[2:28:47.120 --> 2:28:50.640]  We'll be right back. I'm going to hit the martial law news, the rest of the other news and
[2:28:51.840 --> 2:28:59.840]  the pedophile news. If you're concerned about the power grid, so this could be literally your
[2:28:59.840 --> 2:29:05.040]  last chance with all the insane things happening in the world to get enforced products and to

[2:29:59.840 --> 2:30:04.640]  in Tennessee. Welcome. Hello, Alex. Yes, Malcolm. All right. I will make this quick and real short
[2:30:04.640 --> 2:30:09.600]  where the other Patriots can get on the line. Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your
[2:30:09.600 --> 2:30:15.360]  co-hosts, Owen Schreuer. Supermail volatility and brain force plus. Mix those two together.
[2:30:15.360 --> 2:30:20.720]  You're an unstoppable tank. Supermail volatility really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs
[2:30:20.720 --> 2:30:27.200]  and natural compounds that have never been heated up. And so it has a dramatic effect compared to
[2:30:27.200 --> 2:30:31.920]  powdered versions. It also worked quite well. They just aren't as strong. This is like a very fine
[2:30:31.920 --> 2:30:36.800]  wine. In fact, each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay.
[2:30:36.800 --> 2:30:40.160]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[2:30:40.160 --> 2:30:46.000]  That's just how it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super
[2:30:46.000 --> 2:30:50.400]  strong. But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[2:30:56.880 --> 2:31:03.760]  Christmas Day 2021 is almost here. And I want to encourage our amazing listeners and viewers
[2:31:03.760 --> 2:31:06.560]  who have changed the world through your support of Info Wars
[2:31:07.760 --> 2:31:11.440]  to help take this fight against Terri to the next level. And that's what Reset Wars does.
[2:31:11.440 --> 2:31:18.480]  We've extended the sale of 25% off on the course, Mind Wars Spirit Wars. There's two courses in one
[2:31:19.040 --> 2:31:25.280]  until Christmas Day. Ladies and gentlemen, help give your friends, your family, your neighbors,
[2:31:25.280 --> 2:31:30.640]  the gift of being aware of how the globalists are manipulating them and trying to break their will.
[2:31:30.640 --> 2:31:36.320]  And please give yourself and the whole world the gift of keeping Info Wars on the air at this
[2:31:36.320 --> 2:31:40.240]  critical time. Without your support, we would have already been shut down. With your support,
[2:31:40.240 --> 2:31:43.520]  we're not just going to stay on air. We're going to take the fight to the next level,
[2:31:43.520 --> 2:31:49.840]  because now is the historic point. Now is the inflection point. And it's all about Reset Wars.

[2:32:00.000 --> 2:32:03.360]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome. Go ahead. Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[2:32:03.360 --> 2:32:08.160]  Good, Alex. Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[2:32:08.160 --> 2:32:12.000]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting,
[2:32:12.000 --> 2:32:15.520]  moralization, and absurdity. It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[2:32:15.520 --> 2:32:18.880]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[2:32:18.880 --> 2:32:22.320]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out
[2:32:22.320 --> 2:32:27.120]  for one of the products. The X2 does wonders. I recommend it to everybody here on the fence
[2:32:27.120 --> 2:32:30.480]  about it. Get off the fence, get the product, support the Info Wars.
[2:32:30.480 --> 2:32:33.280]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[2:32:33.280 --> 2:32:35.680]  Hey, Alex. It's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[2:32:35.680 --> 2:32:41.200]  Honored talk to you. Awesome. So first thing I wanted to do was to say I love the products,
[2:32:41.200 --> 2:32:47.200]  alpha power, even at 29. If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps with the bedroom.
[2:32:47.200 --> 2:32:50.480]  So just number one for a few of you. Well, it definitely works. It's not a joke.
[2:32:51.440 --> 2:32:52.160]  Absolutely.
[2:32:52.160 --> 2:33:20.080]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[2:33:20.080 --> 2:33:24.320]  you are the resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[2:33:25.600 --> 2:33:31.200]  So the article I've told just went live on infowars.com. So you might want to hit refresh on that.
[2:33:32.080 --> 2:33:37.360]  We filed a big suit against the January 6th committee, United States District Court District of
[2:33:37.920 --> 2:33:42.800]  Columbia Select Committee to investigate the January 6th attack on the United States. Nancy
[2:33:42.800 --> 2:33:52.320]  Pelosi, Benny G. Thompson, Elizabeth L. Cheney, Adam B. Schiff, James B. Raskin, Susan E.
[2:33:52.320 --> 2:34:00.000]  Lofgren, and the rest of the Motley crew. And so again, here is the lawsuit.
[2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:07.600]  And we're going to be taking action in many other ways to fight back for this country.
[2:34:07.600 --> 2:34:14.240]  People say, well, why is this your fight? They are going after everybody's free speech and
[2:34:14.240 --> 2:34:20.320]  everybody's right to assemble with this garbage and are setting precedents that, again, would make
[2:34:24.800 --> 2:34:31.520]  Joseph McCarthy blush. So I'll be covering more of this lengthy lawsuit. It's really
[2:34:31.520 --> 2:34:37.760]  good reading, but I'm told it's going up on infowars.com any minute. But there's the
[2:34:37.760 --> 2:34:44.800]  exclusiveness and there's the exclusive magazine thick suit that is very historical
[2:34:45.840 --> 2:34:48.800]  and extremely, extremely important.
[2:34:55.360 --> 2:34:58.640]  You know, I'm going to take a break for a while. I may just leave. I just this country,
[2:34:58.640 --> 2:35:03.840]  so the whole country, it's just everything's sick. You know, at a certain point, I just,
[2:35:03.840 --> 2:35:07.680]  nobody takes stuff serious. That's why you're all going to die. I mean, the globalists are
[2:35:07.680 --> 2:35:12.960]  injecting children with deadly poison everywhere that they know erases their immune system.
[2:35:12.960 --> 2:35:18.240]  And Trump is running around in a stupid red tie, playing the part of the apprentice CEO,
[2:35:18.240 --> 2:35:22.160]  telling everybody, oh, you're playing into their hands, not taking their shot.
[2:35:22.160 --> 2:35:27.520]  No, Trump, you are playing into their hands and destroying yourself and signing yourself onto the
[2:35:27.520 --> 2:35:32.720]  New World Order. And that idiot Bill O'Reilly, what a pervert, doesn't even know how to pick
[2:35:32.720 --> 2:35:36.080]  women up. It's all just an incredible joke.
[2:35:39.520 --> 2:35:45.200]  See, I just can't get mad on there anymore. You know, there's the Gregory's report.
[2:35:45.200 --> 2:35:47.840]  There's a Gregory's report. They just filed it's so important.
[2:35:48.800 --> 2:35:53.840]  And so let's just air that. And I may just go to rebroadcast. I'm not trying to be dramatic here.
[2:35:53.840 --> 2:35:59.520]  I just, I may just never come back. You know, I mean, seriously, just let everybody have what
[2:35:59.520 --> 2:36:04.960]  you want. Let ship and Pelosi rob you. Let them molest your children. Let them take your four-year-olds
[2:36:04.960 --> 2:36:09.760]  away and chop their genitals off. You love it. Everybody's too busy with their own life and
[2:36:09.760 --> 2:36:14.960]  their own thing and their own this and their own Kandy S BS to wake up out of the coma that there
[2:36:14.960 --> 2:36:20.800]  is a satanic offworld alien attack going on on this planet. I mean, you look at it and you analyze
[2:36:20.800 --> 2:36:25.680]  that this ain't human and you people need to wake up and rally against it. Or maybe we are a bad
[2:36:25.680 --> 2:36:32.000]  species. Maybe this thing wiping us out is good. I just know this. There is an advanced intelligence
[2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:37.280]  running this damn thing and it's sophisticated and there's all these delusional people going along
[2:36:37.280 --> 2:36:41.680]  with it. I think it's funny. I think it's cute and it's not cute. I don't care if you're Donald
[2:36:41.680 --> 2:36:46.000]  Trump. I don't care if you're Bill Gates. I don't care who you are. You come at children with
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:51.920]  experimental Nuremberg code violating vaccines that you broke the law to ram through. You are
[2:36:51.920 --> 2:36:57.280]  terrorist in league with Joseph Mengele 2.0. Here's Greg Reese's report.
[2:37:04.320 --> 2:37:11.920]  On October 25th of 2021, the CDC released an order continuing to deceptively act as if they
[2:37:11.920 --> 2:37:18.960]  have that authority requiring proof of negative covid tests from all international air travelers
[2:37:18.960 --> 2:37:25.200]  two years old and up boarding a flight to the United States beginning on December 6th. The
[2:37:25.200 --> 2:37:32.160]  passenger has to be tested within 24 hours of travel to meet the CDC requirements. The tests
[2:37:32.160 --> 2:37:38.800]  can be self administered. The tests are not approved by the FDA but have been greenlit under
[2:37:38.800 --> 2:37:45.280]  the emergency use authorization authority. So if anything goes wrong, the manufacturer is free
[2:37:45.280 --> 2:37:52.480]  of liability. What could go wrong is that Abbott has included the lethal drug sodium azide into the
[2:37:52.480 --> 2:38:00.160]  do it yourself test kit. Sodium azide has caused deaths for decades. Even minute amounts can
[2:38:00.160 --> 2:38:07.440]  cause organ damage, sowing most of its damage into the heart and brain. There is a small warning
[2:38:07.440 --> 2:38:14.080]  and instructions not to touch the swab to the regent solution. The lethal sodium azide. But
[2:38:14.080 --> 2:38:19.920]  mistakes happen and there have been several deaths and injuries in hospitals and laboratories by
[2:38:19.920 --> 2:38:27.040]  trained professionals handling sodium azide. In one instance, sodium azide was poured down a drain
[2:38:27.040 --> 2:38:34.640]  causing it to explode and release toxic gas. Sodium azide is fatal if swallowed, fatal in
[2:38:34.640 --> 2:38:42.400]  contact with skin and fatal if inhaled. And it is now included in over the counter test kits
[2:38:42.400 --> 2:38:47.360]  for frantic everyday citizens to hurry through a day before international travel,
[2:38:47.360 --> 2:39:04.720]  including two-year-olds. What could go wrong? For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[2:39:08.720 --> 2:39:15.040]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and
[2:39:15.040 --> 2:39:19.840]  chemicals added to the food, it's all come out. And they're doing that not because we're weak,
[2:39:19.840 --> 2:39:25.440]  but because we're made the image of God, the Creator, and we are powerful. And the social
[2:39:25.440 --> 2:39:30.960]  engineers fear that so much. So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody
[2:39:30.960 --> 2:39:39.920]  knows who first came up with the boy, is it true? The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation
[2:39:39.920 --> 2:39:44.960]  was hopeless. They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their
[2:39:44.960 --> 2:39:52.080]  cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the God
[2:39:52.080 --> 2:39:56.640]  of this world who is a loser. And that's why it's so important that everybody keep Infowars
[2:39:56.640 --> 2:40:01.200]  in the air now more than ever. Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are
[2:40:01.200 --> 2:40:06.320]  manifesting and setting up is Satanic. And we are opposing the one-world government and the
[2:40:06.320 --> 2:40:12.240]  mark of the beast they just announced. Well, the Bill of Rights is a stumbling block on the way to
[2:40:12.240 --> 2:40:18.000]  shutting down speech that the left doesn't like, at least in government. But there's a new avenue
[2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:23.600]  for those who would like to censor what you say and think, and that's corporations. The left have
[2:40:23.600 --> 2:40:30.240]  wised up to this. If you want to stop someone from telling the truth, use companies to do it. The
[2:40:30.240 --> 2:40:35.440]  social media giants, and they are. For many on the left, the view seems to have become that
[2:40:35.440 --> 2:40:40.000]  if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking. So far the most prominent casualty of the crusade
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:44.640]  against free expression has been the radio show host Alex Jones. There is a concerted effort by
[2:40:44.640 --> 2:40:49.760]  the Democratic Party and multinational corporations in Big Tech to silence conservative and nationalist
[2:40:49.760 --> 2:40:54.880]  and populist voices. There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and
[2:40:54.880 --> 2:41:00.560]  saying, can you ban this person? He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist, but this week,
[2:41:00.560 --> 2:41:06.160]  Alex Jones' content will be a little harder to find. Shame on the mainstream corporate media for
[2:41:06.160 --> 2:41:10.560]  not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack dogging, calling for federal regulators
[2:41:10.560 --> 2:41:16.880]  to shut down independent, free press, working with Big Tech. People know what's true. They can smell it.
[2:41:16.880 --> 2:41:24.640]  Info wars, the most banned network in the world. In a free country, everyone can be heard.
[2:41:24.640 --> 2:41:31.920]  Inter-talentarian societies only the powerful can be heard.
[2:41:33.440 --> 2:41:39.600]  You walk into this room at your own risk, because it leads to the future. Not a future that will
[2:41:39.600 --> 2:41:47.200]  be but one that might be. This is not a new world. It is simply an extension of what began in the
[2:41:47.200 --> 2:41:52.800]  old one. It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint
[2:41:52.800 --> 2:41:59.440]  of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time. It has refinements, technological
[2:41:59.440 --> 2:42:05.760]  advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom. But like every
[2:42:05.760 --> 2:42:13.200]  one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule. Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[2:42:13.200 --> 2:42:25.520]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth in his last 48 hours on earth. He's a citizen of the state but will
[2:42:25.520 --> 2:42:33.120]  soon have to be eliminated because he's built out of flesh and because he has a mind. Mr. Romney
[2:42:33.120 --> 2:42:47.280]  Wordsworth who will draw his last breaths in the twilight zone. All right folks, I'm going to come
[2:42:47.280 --> 2:42:51.040]  back as best I can but I can't promise I'm going to be able to host the rest of the hour or even
[2:42:51.040 --> 2:43:00.080]  the next hour because I'm just too angry and and I mean this could be in full wars last Christmas
[2:43:00.080 --> 2:43:06.400]  because it could be America's last Christmas. Evil is taking over the planet. They're destroying our
[2:43:06.400 --> 2:43:11.520]  borders, our sovereignty, our supply chains, our language, our currencies. They're coming after us
[2:43:11.520 --> 2:43:16.880]  and if we don't support American businesses and if we don't support independent media in the final
[2:43:16.880 --> 2:43:24.960]  days of 2021, we have no future in the midterms in 2022. 2022 is the year where America decides its
[2:43:24.960 --> 2:43:29.520]  fate. I want to thank you all for your support. I want to encourage you to your Christmas shopping
[2:43:29.520 --> 2:43:35.040]  at fullwarstore.com because I can barely keep our operation going and I appreciate you keeping us

[2:43:56.240 --> 2:44:02.000]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today. Half the
[2:44:02.000 --> 2:44:07.840]  population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection because
[2:44:07.840 --> 2:44:13.120]  they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease. The perpetrators of all this
[2:44:13.120 --> 2:44:18.160]  have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial
[2:44:18.160 --> 2:44:24.000]  intelligence hive mind in less than nine years. For those of us who have awoken from the spell,
[2:44:24.000 --> 2:44:28.320]  we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see,
[2:44:28.320 --> 2:44:34.000]  but there is only two things to do. We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[2:44:34.000 --> 2:44:40.080]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win. But even when we win and we eventually will,
[2:44:40.080 --> 2:44:45.600]  the days of convenience are soon coming to an end and so we must prepare, get up to a years worth
[2:44:45.600 --> 2:44:52.640]  of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios and lifesaving
[2:44:52.640 --> 2:45:00.640]  knowledge at infoorstore.com. It's time to protect your privacy. It's time to come to grips with the
[2:45:00.640 --> 2:45:06.320]  fact that even though you don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech
[2:45:06.320 --> 2:45:11.760]  government are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go
[2:45:11.760 --> 2:45:17.200]  and what you do. So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[2:45:17.200 --> 2:45:21.600]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts,
[2:45:21.600 --> 2:45:26.400]  protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount. That's why

[2:45:55.520 --> 2:46:02.080]  It's hard to believe that Christmas 2021 is here and soon will be in the year 2022.
[2:46:02.080 --> 2:46:13.280]  Everything the globalist plan on doing, their entire operations hinge on you psychologically,
[2:46:13.280 --> 2:46:17.280]  not understanding that they're trying to break your will, that they're trying to
[2:46:18.560 --> 2:46:23.440]  drive you into submission. But if you're aware of this basic fact and how they are
[2:46:23.440 --> 2:46:30.320]  scientifically controlling you, then you're basically immune. This is next level information
[2:46:30.320 --> 2:46:35.840]  on how to take control of your mind. It's how I've been able to stand against the incredible attacks
[2:46:35.840 --> 2:46:42.880]  they've carried out because I'm able to connect to the divine. I'm able to transcend this dimension
[2:46:42.880 --> 2:46:47.840]  simply by becoming aware of the fact that I already transcended it. So until Christmas day,
[2:46:48.480 --> 2:46:54.560]  we're offering reset wars are incredible two part course for 25% off at reset wars.com.
[2:46:54.560 --> 2:47:04.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:13.360 --> 2:47:14.640]  Here's what I'm trying to say.
[2:47:17.920 --> 2:47:24.480]  All of us, including myself, need to get out of our comfort zones and realize this
[2:47:24.480 --> 2:47:31.680]  is it. Children across the world are being injected with a genetic therapy designed to
[2:47:31.680 --> 2:47:35.680]  turn off their white blood cells and give them something very akin to AIDS.
[2:47:36.880 --> 2:47:40.800]  We've had medical doctors on to lay that out. It's in literally hundreds of studies.
[2:47:40.800 --> 2:47:45.680]  The horror of that alone and that we're now living it and to watch
[2:47:45.680 --> 2:47:53.120]  Rampol not come out against the shots and Trump not come out against it
[2:47:56.800 --> 2:48:00.240]  puts me over the top. But you know what? I'm going to move away from that
[2:48:05.520 --> 2:48:10.560]  and I'm going to cover the news right now and I will be hosting the fourth hour
[2:48:10.560 --> 2:48:17.840]  and I've got so much important stuff to get to. But you know, I follow how the global
[2:48:17.840 --> 2:48:22.000]  stop rate. It's what I do and I have a long memory. I have a very good memory. I know you do
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:25.920]  as well. Many of you, some of you don't. That's like it's a blessing in some ways.
[2:48:27.360 --> 2:48:32.240]  But the Bible says at the beginning of knowledge is sorrow and with great knowledge comes great
[2:48:32.240 --> 2:48:41.280]  sorrow. And you know, big techs announcing new lockdowns of their campuses. They're closing
[2:48:41.280 --> 2:48:49.120]  them. The Debo script is as they did two years ago is announcing that they're closing ahead
[2:48:49.120 --> 2:48:54.880]  of the other lockdowns and Biden tomorrow is going to make some new big draconian announcements
[2:48:54.880 --> 2:49:03.040]  against the unvaccinated saying that we are locked down, totally ignoring natural immunity,
[2:49:03.840 --> 2:49:08.800]  totally ignoring real science. But they just repeat over and over again like parrots.
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:14.240]  As I've been saying for several years, I saw a conservative comic, I guess I forget his name.
[2:49:14.240 --> 2:49:18.720]  This weekend, somebody sent me a clip of him acting at that Dallas conference I was unable
[2:49:18.720 --> 2:49:23.520]  to go to. I wish I would have gone last weekend, not this weekend, but last weekend,
[2:49:23.520 --> 2:49:28.480]  last weekend, weekend before last, where he is like, like send her like cockatoos like,
[2:49:28.480 --> 2:49:33.440]  work science, work science. And the left was all freaking out about him making fun of it. But
[2:49:33.440 --> 2:49:37.680]  they don't ever give you any science. They don't ever show you a research paper. They don't show
[2:49:37.680 --> 2:49:42.240]  you a statistic. In fact, in the news, they admitted it raises your immune system. In the news,
[2:49:42.240 --> 2:49:50.560]  it admits that it makes you weak. They have put inserts in it now saying can make you have heart
[2:49:50.560 --> 2:50:02.880]  failure or heart swelling. And it causes 82% increase in miscarriages in the first and second
[2:50:02.880 --> 2:50:10.640]  trimester. That's the American New England Medical Journal. And so here's the headline,
[2:50:11.360 --> 2:50:15.360]  World Economic Forum in Davos postpone for second straight year.
[2:50:15.360 --> 2:50:23.920]  Oh, they're the ones running the whole attack. And so they precipitate by, oh, we're canceling
[2:50:23.920 --> 2:50:29.120]  our event. And now everything else cancels. And it causes more starvation in the third world,
[2:50:29.120 --> 2:50:33.200]  more shutdowns of small businesses, but all the big businesses, all the big companies,
[2:50:33.200 --> 2:50:39.840]  they consolidate power and get more rich and more powerful. While the army of lawyers goes out and
[2:50:39.840 --> 2:50:49.920]  sues out of business, all of their opposition. This is modern warfare. So it's been deferred.
[2:50:54.720 --> 2:50:56.400]  That's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:50:58.960 --> 2:51:04.080]  And now Fauci and all of them have announced, oh, sorry, this is going to be here forever.
[2:51:04.080 --> 2:51:08.640]  And you got to take these shots forever. And oh, there's record sickness this Christmas.
[2:51:08.640 --> 2:51:13.120]  Oh, we're going to have to come in and shut down a lot of facilities and shut down a
[2:51:13.120 --> 2:51:18.400]  lot of buildings and all the rest of it while they've cut the police in all these blue cities,
[2:51:18.400 --> 2:51:22.800]  which will cause an even bigger crime wave. And then if you defend yourself,
[2:51:22.800 --> 2:51:25.840]  when somebody's breaking in your house to rape you or your wife or rob you,
[2:51:28.240 --> 2:51:32.000]  well, then the district attorneys go, oh, we're going to prosecute you.
[2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:40.800]  We don't prosecute criminals attacking people. I mean, I tried to go to the mall last night to
[2:51:40.800 --> 2:51:44.640]  see the Superman movie because, again, I don't watch Marvel comic type stuff. I'm not living in
[2:51:44.640 --> 2:51:48.720]  Fantasyland, but it's all over the news that, yeah, the villain is based on Alex Jones,
[2:51:50.640 --> 2:51:55.040]  a talk show host that sells vitamins. So that's criminal. That's what villains do.
[2:51:56.000 --> 2:51:59.920]  And they're, oh, sorry, it's closed. Sorry. We'll refund your tickets because of all the
[2:51:59.920 --> 2:52:03.840]  snatch and grabs and robberies that are going on. And I'm just like, it's like a third world country.
[2:52:05.280 --> 2:52:12.000]  And it's beyond a third world country. That's what we've become. One big Mexico City. I don't
[2:52:12.000 --> 2:52:17.120]  mean because there's a lot of Mexicans in the U.S. I mean, Mexico City is a failed, dangerous,
[2:52:17.120 --> 2:52:24.240]  predatory, out of control situation. And statistically, cities like Chicago are worse
[2:52:24.240 --> 2:52:34.240]  than Mexico City. So that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen. And listen,
[2:52:37.360 --> 2:52:41.040]  I'm just sad to see this all happening. I thought we could back it off. I thought we
[2:52:41.040 --> 2:52:44.480]  could stop it. That was the only prediction I was wrong about. The only big one.
[2:52:46.640 --> 2:52:51.440]  And so what do you think Biden's going to announce tomorrow? It's going to be bad. I mean,
[2:52:51.440 --> 2:52:57.200]  it's going to be in line with what's being announced in Europe. Mass arrest of the unvaccinated,
[2:52:57.200 --> 2:53:00.640]  forced inoculation. One year in prison if you don't take the shot.
[2:53:02.400 --> 2:53:06.560]  That's camps. That's people being disappeared because they won't take something that isn't
[2:53:06.560 --> 2:53:18.560]  a vaccine that's experimental, that doesn't work. We have people power and we have to fight back.
[2:53:18.560 --> 2:53:23.200]  We have to say no. We have to speak up. And we've got to go protest at all these injection centers
[2:53:24.560 --> 2:53:28.000]  at these public schools, these poor little children wearing these masks that gives them
[2:53:28.000 --> 2:53:33.520]  serious brain damage and cognitive decline. Their studies out the lowest IQs ever plunging
[2:53:33.520 --> 2:53:39.120]  cognitive scores in children across the Western world. I mean, our poor little children are being
[2:53:39.120 --> 2:53:45.440]  gagged by these monsters. And let me show you this. Let me show you this. And then I'll go to
[2:53:45.440 --> 2:53:52.880]  break and come back and actually drill through it all. None of this has to happen, folks, but
[2:53:52.880 --> 2:54:01.920]  our acquiescence has summoned this hell. Look at this article out of Newsweek.
[2:54:03.520 --> 2:54:12.080]  Children as young as four can now change their gender in Scottish schools without
[2:54:12.080 --> 2:54:20.560]  parental consent. Let's unpack that. So the state's saying we have control over your children's
[2:54:20.560 --> 2:54:26.160]  identity and who they are. And we don't care what you say. We're going to confuse and convince a
[2:54:26.160 --> 2:54:31.920]  four-year-old in pretend games to tell a little boy you're a girl, to tell a little girl you're a boy,
[2:54:31.920 --> 2:54:39.760]  and then designate that, give them to a counselor, and by age seven, they can begin chemical castration.
[2:54:39.760 --> 2:54:48.080]  See, the pedophiles know that there's a big block in an absolute outlaw and a taboo for
[2:54:48.080 --> 2:55:03.440]  good reason against sex with children. And they want control over your children. They want to be
[2:55:03.440 --> 2:55:10.080]  able to sexually not just rape them, but destroy their fertility and their future and take full
[2:55:10.080 --> 2:55:15.120]  ownership of them and enforce them using mind control techniques in this identity.
[2:55:15.120 --> 2:55:19.760]  And I don't just read about this in the news. I have friends and family in Texas,
[2:55:22.160 --> 2:55:32.240]  in Dallas, and in East Texas, where they call in nine, 10-year-olds and tell them,
[2:55:32.240 --> 2:55:35.600]  oh, you're supposed to see the counselor. And they go, hey, you're really a boy.
[2:55:37.280 --> 2:55:43.760]  You really like girls. And it's a little girl. She goes, no, I'm a girl and I like boys.
[2:55:44.560 --> 2:55:48.560]  No, no, no, you're confused here. I want you to sign up for this. We got free counseling. You
[2:55:48.560 --> 2:55:54.240]  get to go see a person. They are literally abusing their minds engaged in serious crime.
[2:55:54.240 --> 2:56:01.600]  This is beyond pedophilia. This is the rape of their gender, the rape of their God-given identity.
[2:56:02.160 --> 2:56:05.840]  It's not saying if somebody really wants to try to be something else that they can't
[2:56:06.480 --> 2:56:13.200]  pretend to be that or live in that fantasy world. This is the forcing of this criminal
[2:56:14.320 --> 2:56:22.160]  agenda. Yeah, there's another one, KTTH. Seattle schools teach five-year-old students
[2:56:22.160 --> 2:56:28.640]  to pick gender, disrupt nuclear family. Print that for me. Because that's what this is all about.
[2:56:32.400 --> 2:56:36.800]  Whether you're in Australia or whether you're in Germany or whether you are in Mexico now,
[2:56:36.800 --> 2:56:42.000]  they're doing it. All the big corporate money is about teaching children or something else
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:52.960]  to, quote, disrupt the nuclear family. And when the CIA, through the German government, sent
[2:56:52.960 --> 2:56:58.000]  hundreds of thousands of children into the hands of pedophiles to live with a pedophile,
[2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:03.760]  to be raped by a pedophile, to create the new structure of the family. That's mainstream news.
[2:57:03.760 --> 2:57:09.680]  That's what this group is. It's the pedophiles, the people that are obsessed with children and
[2:57:09.680 --> 2:57:14.000]  want to screw up children and want to cut their genitals off, that want to drug your children,
[2:57:14.000 --> 2:57:18.320]  that want to rape your children of their future, not just physically rape them.
[2:57:20.880 --> 2:57:25.360]  I wouldn't be surprised if God didn't just blow the whole planet up now. Because if we don't stand
[2:57:25.360 --> 2:57:29.520]  up against this, we deserve everything happens. And I'm fighting hard and trying to stay on air

[2:58:58.800 --> 2:59:03.680]  The New World Order would have already basically won if it wasn't for info wars and I'm not bragging.
[2:59:04.320 --> 2:59:09.040]  I'm letting you know that together as a family, we have changed the world and that we have a
[2:59:09.040 --> 2:59:15.200]  responsibility because God put us in this position to not back down now at the very critical point.
[2:59:16.000 --> 2:59:19.920]  This is an info war and the globalists are trying to break your will and demoralize you
[2:59:19.920 --> 2:59:25.760]  and I produced a two part course mind war spirit or six plus hours that lays out the most game
[2:59:25.760 --> 2:59:31.440]  changing information ever. It's available right now at reset wars.com and through Christmas day

[2:59:44.320 --> 2:59:53.280]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:59:59.520 --> 3:00:04.640]  Resident Biden's commencement speech at South Carolina State University was a
[3:00:04.640 --> 3:00:12.880]  minefield of outright lies, misinformation, far left fantasies and dementia riddled bad craziness.
[3:00:12.880 --> 3:00:18.800]  Why is the police officer showing up to the suicide threat someone threatened to jump off a
[3:00:18.800 --> 3:00:25.200]  building? We need more social workers there. We need more psychologists there. They need help.
[3:00:25.840 --> 3:00:29.680]  They're basically good people. Prevent violence in the first place. The uncertainty
[3:00:30.640 --> 3:00:38.320]  of a debt economy, the reckoning on race not seen since the 50s and 60s. Your time here has come
[3:00:38.320 --> 3:00:44.320]  during a tumultuous and consequential moment in modern American history and has led you to
[3:00:44.320 --> 3:00:51.200]  graduate at a real inflection point. Biden goaded on by the mainstream media and his helpers exists
[3:00:51.200 --> 3:00:57.600]  in an alternate universe where the horrors of racial inequality rain down on black Americans
[3:00:57.600 --> 3:01:05.840]  with the same intensity as the end of reconstruction. No, no, not a joke. I thought we're finally,
[3:01:05.840 --> 3:01:15.280]  finally beginning to move. But this new sinister combination of voter suppression
[3:01:15.920 --> 3:01:23.120]  and election subversion, it's un-American. It's undemocratic and sadly it is unprecedented
[3:01:23.120 --> 3:01:28.960]  since reconstruction. But each and every time it gets brought up, that other team blocks the
[3:01:28.960 --> 3:01:36.880]  ability even to start to discuss it. That other team. We used to be called a Republican party.
[3:01:36.880 --> 3:01:41.680]  We continue to confront the oldest and darkest forces in this nation, hate and racism.
[3:01:43.760 --> 3:01:50.000]  You know, there's a through line from Owensboro massacre that happened 53 years ago
[3:01:50.000 --> 3:01:57.280]  that killed three students for whom this very area, this very arena is named. It's a darkness
[3:01:57.280 --> 3:02:04.000]  that pierced the grace of Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, which I visited right afterwards
[3:02:04.000 --> 3:02:11.120]  six years ago, to the torches. Those you ever think you'd see in the modern times,
[3:02:12.080 --> 3:02:18.320]  people coming out of the fields down in Charleston, I mean in Charlotte, Virginia,
[3:02:18.320 --> 3:02:28.160]  in Charlottesville, Virginia, carrying torches and Nazi banners, screeching, most anti-Semitic
[3:02:29.200 --> 3:02:34.400]  and anti-black rhetoric in history, hundreds and hundreds of them.
[3:02:37.200 --> 3:02:42.480]  And when I asked the guy who had this job before, when I asked what he thought about it,
[3:02:42.480 --> 3:02:49.040]  he said, well, there's some very good people there. Hell, very good people. They're racist,
[3:02:49.040 --> 3:02:59.040]  they're fascist. And folks, that was four years ago. I never thought I'd see that in my career.
[3:03:00.160 --> 3:03:06.480]  The violent and deadly insurrection on Capitol Hill 11 months ago, on January the 6th,
[3:03:06.480 --> 3:03:14.800]  I've known every major world leader in the last 40 years. I've spoken over 140 heads of state
[3:03:15.360 --> 3:03:23.440]  since I've become president. You know what they'll ask me? Is America going to be all right?
[3:03:26.960 --> 3:03:30.720]  What about democracy in America? Did you ever think you'd be asked that question?
[3:03:30.720 --> 3:03:36.960]  You can defeat it, but you can't eliminate it. It just slides back under a rock.
[3:03:38.400 --> 3:03:46.880]  And when given oxygen by political leaders, it comes out ugly and mean as it was before.
[3:03:48.240 --> 3:03:56.000]  We can't give it any oxygen. We have to step on it. We have to respond to it. It's not who we are.
[3:03:56.000 --> 3:04:02.720]  We learned there's no difference between a black entrepreneur and a white entrepreneur in success,
[3:04:03.680 --> 3:04:06.320]  except the black entrepreneur usually doesn't have a lawyer.
[3:04:06.880 --> 3:04:13.920]  And while he was at it, Biden made scientific predictions that had no basis in fact or scientific
[3:04:13.920 --> 3:04:22.000]  terms. In the next 10 years, we've seen the last 50 because of the incredible, incredible change
[3:04:22.000 --> 3:04:29.520]  in science and technology. You're going to see us traveling commercially the next 20 years at
[3:04:30.320 --> 3:04:36.560]  12, 15,000 miles an hour. Subsonic speeds, supersonic speed. I mean...
[3:04:36.560 --> 3:04:41.120]  But Sleepy Joe is not alone. He is surrounded by sociopaths.
[3:04:41.120 --> 3:04:44.800]  For the first time in 20 years, there are no US troops in harm's way.
[3:04:44.800 --> 3:04:48.960]  The full report is on BAN.Video. It's one of John Bowne's latest. We're going to come back
[3:04:48.960 --> 3:04:54.080]  and we're going to plunge straight into all the news and all the information.
[3:04:55.840 --> 3:05:00.640]  Well, here we are. I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in M4's live
[3:05:00.640 --> 3:05:04.800]  products. And that's why for more than two years, we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth.
[3:05:04.800 --> 3:05:10.000]  And we could never get the ingredients again until now. And we have reformulated and not
[3:05:10.000 --> 3:05:15.120]  just used the same ingredients. We've boosted it and made them even stronger. So out of all
[3:05:15.120 --> 3:05:19.440]  the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level. Let's know what it's got in it.
[3:05:19.440 --> 3:05:24.560]  Cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[3:05:24.560 --> 3:05:29.520]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder,
[3:05:29.520 --> 3:05:34.080]  and a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbocharge your body with antioxidants.
[3:05:34.080 --> 3:05:38.240]  And then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium, and sodium added.
[3:05:38.240 --> 3:05:42.000]  I mean, this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes. It's got real organic
[3:05:42.000 --> 3:05:47.040]  cocoa butter powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt. And it just goes on and
[3:05:47.040 --> 3:05:53.120]  on. It is now back in stock ultimate bone broth plus available at 20% off and free shipping
[3:05:53.120 --> 3:06:04.800]  out of the gates at infowarstore.com. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live
[3:06:04.800 --> 3:06:14.160]  from the front lines of the info war. So the puppet president is set to announce
[3:06:14.160 --> 3:06:23.920]  new COVID measures tomorrow as Omnicron variant spikes across the US. Extremely asymptomatic,
[3:06:23.920 --> 3:06:28.320]  hardly anybody getting sick. Whole thing just sounds like a totally made up lie. I don't believe a word
[3:06:28.320 --> 3:06:34.720]  of it. Video German health minister calls for immediate forced vaccination of entire population.
[3:06:34.720 --> 3:06:40.560]  Remember the unelected EU chairman said two weeks ago, do this by February 1st. Now they're just
[3:06:40.560 --> 3:06:45.600]  acting like it's coming from the German people and their elected quote officials. But no,
[3:06:45.600 --> 3:06:51.040]  it's already been decided February 1st door to door force injection mass rounds up the return of
[3:06:51.040 --> 3:06:56.400]  Hitler. And Trump says we're playing right in their hands. We should take the shots. They're
[3:06:56.400 --> 3:07:03.040]  wonderful. South African officials advised governments to stop tracing and quarantining
[3:07:03.040 --> 3:07:09.200]  Omnicron contacts because most don't experience any symptoms. And there's almost no deaths. It's
[3:07:09.200 --> 3:07:12.960]  even weaker than ever. But it doesn't matter. It's another cold virus. We've got to shut everything
[3:07:12.960 --> 3:07:18.240]  down. Which will cause mass starvation. Netherlands to go into strict Christmas lockdown.
[3:07:19.840 --> 3:07:23.600]  It's all about them raping your Christmas, all about them getting the middle of your life,
[3:07:23.600 --> 3:07:29.680]  forcing themselves on you. Omnicron is going to take over. This winner said Fauci and Americans
[3:07:29.680 --> 3:07:37.840]  should race for a tough few weeks to months into next year and the midterms and more mail-in ballots.
[3:07:38.960 --> 3:07:44.000]  Americans are increasingly refusing to obey mandates in the name of fighting COVID because
[3:07:44.000 --> 3:07:50.240]  it's nothing but a globalist power grab of the left that has lost control of the narrative and
[3:07:50.240 --> 3:07:59.120]  that are hated the world around. Email shows Fauci and Collins conspired for devastating
[3:07:59.120 --> 3:08:05.040]  takedown of alternative COVID plan when they told them you need to get herd immunity. You need to
[3:08:05.040 --> 3:08:09.280]  not make people stay in their houses. You don't need to give shots during an outbreak. It causes
[3:08:09.280 --> 3:08:19.280]  deadly mutations. Most of the world's vaccines likely won't prevent Omnicron. But don't worry.
[3:08:19.280 --> 3:08:25.680]  They've got more shots and more lockdowns for you. Triple Vax Senators Elizabeth Warren and
[3:08:25.680 --> 3:08:30.960]  Cory Booker catch symptomatic COVID. They actually got sick and they said it was COVID.
[3:08:30.960 --> 3:08:39.520]  Oh, yeah, you get COVID from the vaccine and it gets worse. Triple Vax Jim Kramer got sick as well.
[3:08:41.760 --> 3:08:48.640]  French health minister admits vaccine passports are a disguised vaccine mandate. Of course they are.
[3:08:50.000 --> 3:08:54.960]  Moderna booster shot increases antibody levels against Omnicron. The company says, well,
[3:08:54.960 --> 3:09:02.000]  we better take it. They've lied to us so much before and CNN closes offices as COVID-19 cases
[3:09:02.000 --> 3:09:09.520]  rise. Big Tech does it. The Davos Group does it. They all shut down so they can cause that chain
[3:09:09.520 --> 3:09:14.160]  reaction to shut down. And for everybody in the U.S., they say, well, go in more into debt,
[3:09:14.160 --> 3:09:19.520]  get more liquor, watch more Netflix, have more family violence, watch more small businesses go
[3:09:19.520 --> 3:09:24.800]  under. But for some Americans, they like the lockdowns. That's why in the UK, they've got
[3:09:24.800 --> 3:09:29.920]  polls that are probably exaggerated, but still 60, 70% want to go back, depending on the poll,
[3:09:29.920 --> 3:09:33.760]  because you just sit there in your house and get drunk and watch television.
[3:09:35.600 --> 3:09:43.520]  But when the first world collapses, what happens? The third world dies. That's just some of the
[3:09:43.520 --> 3:09:47.760]  news. Let me play a clip of a doctor. By the way, we've shown medical doctors in studio showing
[3:09:47.760 --> 3:09:51.280]  this and it's been documented a whole bunch, but here's another medical doctor showing
[3:09:51.280 --> 3:09:58.160]  that normally blood clots in a Petri dish or on the street, anybody will tell you this,
[3:09:58.160 --> 3:10:04.080]  it's bright red and oxygenated for about 30 minutes. Then it starts turning brown, clotting,
[3:10:04.080 --> 3:10:11.840]  and then turns kind of a purple color, a maroon color as the oxygen goes out of the cells,
[3:10:11.840 --> 3:10:18.080]  as they start to die. Bright red, and then it gets darker and darker and darker and darker,
[3:10:18.080 --> 3:10:23.840]  becomes brick red and then maroon purple. Totally unoxygenated in the veins, it's blue.
[3:10:26.320 --> 3:10:31.200]  And anybody's seen this has been around blood or you shoot a deer and it falls over and there's
[3:10:31.200 --> 3:10:37.680]  a pool of blood, and if you're still around in 30 minutes, it starts to turn brown or purple,
[3:10:38.880 --> 3:10:45.360]  brown and then purple. But not when you shoot the Moderna or Pfizer shot, which causes mass
[3:10:45.360 --> 3:10:52.720]  clotting chain reaction, it does it in minutes, in minutes. And Mike Adams and Dr. Fleming and
[3:10:52.720 --> 3:10:56.080]  others have been working on this for months, because they want to do it all clinically and
[3:10:56.080 --> 3:11:00.160]  like show it and draw somebody's blood on the spot and then have it all under the cameras
[3:11:00.160 --> 3:11:03.920]  and everything. And I'm like, yeah, let's hurry up and do that, because they want you to all see
[3:11:03.920 --> 3:11:07.600]  it here. We're going to have somebody take the blood, probably me, just to make it more dramatic,
[3:11:07.600 --> 3:11:11.200]  because I mean, I'll do anything to save kids. And that's not hard to get your blood taken,
[3:11:11.200 --> 3:11:16.480]  take some Alan Jones blood, put in a petri dish all under HD cameras. Hell, we'll do it live.
[3:11:17.760 --> 3:11:23.760]  And then we'll take some blood out of me. One 30 minutes, still bright red, 20 minutes later.
[3:11:23.760 --> 3:11:30.400]  You put Moderna or Pfizer in, ladies and gentlemen, within a minute or so it starts to turn colors.
[3:11:30.400 --> 3:11:35.040]  Here's video of it happening. So this patient's blood
[3:11:35.040 --> 3:11:39.600]  was drawn three minutes ago,
[3:11:45.840 --> 3:11:51.840]  already clotting in the tube, not normal, takes a half hour usually.
[3:11:56.400 --> 3:11:59.600]  By the way, the full videos on info wars.com. But before this hour ends,
[3:11:59.600 --> 3:12:02.400]  I want to play the full video guys. Let's play another video.
[3:12:02.400 --> 3:12:09.680]  Video unvaccinated Canadian man denied entry to farmers market open air.
[3:12:11.520 --> 3:12:16.240]  Unvaccinated man denied access to purchase food at a farmers market in Toronto, Canada.
[3:12:17.440 --> 3:12:20.480]  I need proof of vaccination for food demand filming ass woman.
[3:12:20.480 --> 3:12:27.440]  Just a month ago, it was trains and airplanes. Now it's everything. And remember what he did
[3:12:27.440 --> 3:12:33.040]  six months ago? He's already bought shots out to 2026. We told you, Oh, new shots are coming.
[3:12:33.040 --> 3:12:36.560]  They're going to say it failed. It's already all in the pipeline. It's all pre prepared.
[3:12:36.560 --> 3:12:42.160]  It's all a scam. Gates said it almost two years ago. He tells his shareholders,
[3:12:42.160 --> 3:12:46.320]  we're going to make 20 to one profit. This is going to be forever. They're going to get monthly
[3:12:46.320 --> 3:12:49.280]  shots at least. Here it is.
[3:12:49.280 --> 3:13:01.840]  I need proof of vaccination to get food in Canada. Yes, I am.
[3:13:02.800 --> 3:13:07.520]  So welcome to our table to environment. This is a performance and effect space.
[3:13:08.560 --> 3:13:12.480]  And you're preventing me from getting food in Canada.
[3:13:12.480 --> 3:13:20.400]  You're preventing me from getting food? How am I supposed to feed? I'm not actually preventing
[3:13:20.400 --> 3:13:28.560]  you. You are. You're saying I can't go in? Are you the manager? No, the manager works Monday
[3:13:28.560 --> 3:13:32.400]  to Friday, nine to five. I'm happy to connect you with her. I want to connect to the manager.
[3:13:32.400 --> 3:13:38.320]  What's his name? Her name. Her name. Her name. It's Oh, it's feminist. It's okay now. Oh, it's
[3:13:38.320 --> 3:13:43.120]  a woman only. You have food. Well, by all goodness, it must be good. And all of her information is
[3:13:43.120 --> 3:13:47.600]  there. So this is the lady that's enforcing fascism. Oh, it's rainbows. It's okay.
[3:13:51.120 --> 3:13:53.760]  The rainbows said you don't get food from having food.
[3:13:56.320 --> 3:14:00.400]  You are. There's food here in your band. She's enjoying it. She had a big work out today.
[3:14:01.360 --> 3:14:06.080]  Gates is growing in her. She'll take her fifth shot soon. But this is segregation.
[3:14:06.080 --> 3:14:11.920]  You're segregating people. You're not letting me have food. Like you're not letting me get food.
[3:14:13.280 --> 3:14:19.600]  This is ridiculous. They're all in combat mode strutting around. All right. I want everyone
[3:14:19.600 --> 3:14:24.080]  to know that you are banning people from getting food in Canada. You are banning. This is
[3:14:24.080 --> 3:14:28.800]  unacceptable. You cannot prevent people from getting food and feeding themselves. This is a
[3:14:28.800 --> 3:14:32.240]  private property. You are trespassing a private property. They love their masks. They love their
[3:14:32.240 --> 3:14:38.560]  tyranny. They're just getting everybody used to disappearing. They're not going to stop folks.
[3:14:38.560 --> 3:14:42.800]  This is the left segregation. You need to leave right now. No, this is segregation. You say I
[3:14:42.800 --> 3:14:49.520]  can't get food because we're not going to vaccinate them. Oh, congratulations. And it's not even a
[3:14:49.520 --> 3:14:56.160]  vaccine. Oh, but he's got a pink mask. He's good. He wants you to know he's a beta. I submit to the
[3:14:56.160 --> 3:15:03.680]  New World Order. I take my shots. I'm ready to die. I'm liberal. I want to talk to your manager.
[3:15:03.680 --> 3:15:09.680]  It's a she. Oh, my gosh, a woman's my boss. Oh, but then it's okay. You're killing me.
[3:15:12.480 --> 3:15:18.160]  It's just so dystopian. And I always wondered if we didn't stop it. What did we like to live
[3:15:18.160 --> 3:15:25.680]  in the New World Order? And now it's here. Now I know what it's like to live in the New World Order.
[3:15:27.120 --> 3:15:32.400]  And now you do too. And once these people inject their children, once they take a shot at the shot
[3:15:32.400 --> 3:15:36.240]  and they get sick, they're going to double down more because they never admit they're wrong.
[3:15:36.240 --> 3:15:41.680]  They never admit they've been scammed. They never admit that they've been signed on to authority
[3:15:41.680 --> 3:15:46.560]  positions because they're helping me the custodians to take out the garbage that's humanity in
[3:15:46.560 --> 3:15:52.320]  Bill Gates's view. We're going to shift gears and get into the martial law plans of Joe Biden's
[3:15:52.320 --> 3:16:00.480]  controllers when we come back. What if you could? I want to explain something that is absolutely
[3:16:00.480 --> 3:16:05.440]  key to understanding our world. It's very, very simple, but the most people don't know. The privately
[3:16:05.440 --> 3:16:12.320]  owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars and
[3:16:12.320 --> 3:16:20.320]  other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual property, energy.
[3:16:20.960 --> 3:16:26.640]  They're using it to buy people, to buy influence. And in the past, they created thousands of trillions
[3:16:26.640 --> 3:16:30.800]  so that they could leverage that, manipulate markets, but they never allowed that money
[3:16:31.360 --> 3:16:35.840]  to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation. Now they've gone ahead
[3:16:35.840 --> 3:16:40.880]  and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy, buying up everything,
[3:16:40.880 --> 3:16:46.480]  not to have the companies operate, but to actually shut them down and force a collapse
[3:16:46.480 --> 3:16:51.520]  of civilization, making the companies they do fund the only things left handed. This is the
[3:16:51.520 --> 3:16:55.440]  great reset. This is what's happening now. Warn everyone is the only way to stop it.
[3:16:56.080 --> 3:17:02.560]  It's hard to believe that Christmas 2021 is here and soon will be in the year 2022.
[3:17:02.560 --> 3:17:13.280]  Everything the globalists plan on doing, their entire operations hinge on you psychologically,
[3:17:13.840 --> 3:17:17.840]  not understanding that they're trying to break your will, that they're trying to
[3:17:19.120 --> 3:17:24.000]  drive you into submission. But if you're aware of this basic fact and how they are
[3:17:24.000 --> 3:17:30.880]  scientifically controlling you, then you're basically immune. This is next level information
[3:17:30.880 --> 3:17:36.000]  on how to take control of your mind. It's how I've been able to stand against the incredible
[3:17:36.000 --> 3:17:40.560]  attacks they've carried out because I'm able to connect to the divine. I'm able to
[3:17:41.200 --> 3:17:46.320]  transcend this dimension simply by becoming aware of the fact that I already transcended it.
[3:17:46.880 --> 3:17:53.840]  So until Christmas Day, we're offering reset wars, our incredible two-part course for 25% off

[3:18:42.240 --> 3:18:46.240]  my car. I've given them to my parents as gifts way out the middle of nowhere where regular phones
[3:18:46.240 --> 3:18:54.320]  don't work. They work. infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and ask the Alex Jones special.
[3:18:58.240 --> 3:19:04.000]  Get our great bag of it here. I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico,
[3:19:04.000 --> 3:19:07.920]  the communists? Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild,
[3:19:07.920 --> 3:19:12.880]  harvested above organic in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee. And yeah,
[3:19:12.880 --> 3:19:16.320]  we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really they're
[3:19:16.320 --> 3:19:20.320]  just a commune. And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it. And the
[3:19:20.320 --> 3:19:23.680]  farmers don't let the Mexican government take over. So I actually buy this from the Mexican
[3:19:23.680 --> 3:19:27.280]  rebels and I've been buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up. The same stuff
[3:19:27.280 --> 3:19:31.840]  sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound. And I just think it's some of
[3:19:31.840 --> 3:19:35.680]  the best coffee you're going to find anywhere. It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the
[3:19:35.680 --> 3:19:43.360]  Chiapas rebels, literally. In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story. We had like the,
[3:19:44.000 --> 3:19:48.880]  I'm not sure if you want to believe it. Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund
[3:19:48.880 --> 3:19:59.520]  this operation. And if you don't find us and don't want to share that's fine. Leading up Frontal
[3:19:59.520 --> 3:20:04.400]  Assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:04.400 --> 3:20:23.920]  And we are back on this live December 20 Monday broadcast in defiance of the censors,

[3:22:56.880 --> 3:23:04.400]  Certainly nobody at this level. And I would love some swinging debt come by here. I'm sorry,
[3:23:04.400 --> 3:23:08.880]  I'm just going to use the terms I want to use. I would just love some big badass to come along
[3:23:08.880 --> 3:23:14.160]  here. And it's on target knows what's going on and knows how to rally people and knows how to
[3:23:14.160 --> 3:23:18.080]  encourage people and knows how to change people's minds like I've been able to do thanks to your
[3:23:18.080 --> 3:23:25.840]  support with so many serious people. But we're the ones kicking globalists ass the best. I had hoped
[3:23:25.840 --> 3:23:34.160]  Trump would be yet I had hoped he would turn around. And I'm now in a neutral position with
[3:23:34.160 --> 3:23:39.680]  Trump. But I don't want to go off into that it made me so upset earlier. Because I hadn't seen the
[3:23:39.680 --> 3:23:45.040]  in the club. And I was busy dealing with following this lawsuit against the January 6th committee
[3:23:45.040 --> 3:23:51.920]  and sitting there with the accounting looking at it all. And I couldn't even get on the shutter
[3:23:51.920 --> 3:23:56.720]  days. I had to make decisions on all this stuff. It's year end right now. And then I'll walk in
[3:23:56.720 --> 3:24:05.440]  there and they go have you seen the truck clip with him although Riley. And I saw it maybe want to
[3:24:05.440 --> 3:24:12.720]  throw up. It's just so sad because we know it isn't a vaccine. We know it erases your immune
[3:24:12.720 --> 3:24:17.760]  system. We know it doesn't protect you. We know they lied. It's all proven. Why is Trump up there?
[3:24:17.760 --> 3:24:21.760]  Because before he was telling the truth on everything. And I was like man this guy's fighting
[3:24:21.760 --> 3:24:27.600]  the UN the globalists the open borders the regulations of small businesses. The one side
[3:24:27.600 --> 3:24:33.360]  of deals with China. And now with the global debos group vaccine new world order takeover.
[3:24:33.360 --> 3:24:37.520]  In fact I cut off the worst part about the booster shots. I want to play the Trump clip again please.
[3:24:40.160 --> 3:24:45.600]  Let the crew know. To then see him do that. I felt like somebody stomped my guts out.
[3:24:47.200 --> 3:24:52.240]  And then you got Trump over here is posing on our side sliding and having and falling apart.
[3:24:52.240 --> 3:24:57.840]  And then over here pedophile leftist that are 10 times worse. And you're just like how do you
[3:24:57.840 --> 3:25:02.480]  deal with something like this. Well you got to reach out to God. Because it's going to be overwhelming
[3:25:02.480 --> 3:25:06.240]  like God is the link I said. You just got to pray for God and pray for the Holy Spirit and
[3:25:06.240 --> 3:25:09.920]  discernment. And just know evil is going to burn itself out. We're going to win in the end.
[3:25:12.800 --> 3:25:18.880]  All right here's here's what Trump had to say again. But look we did something that was historic.
[3:25:18.880 --> 3:25:25.360]  It paused. Get ready to stop it over. We did something. No that auditorium of tens of thousands
[3:25:25.360 --> 3:25:33.120]  of people in Dallas. The auditorium of 19,000 in Houston did not do something historic. They
[3:25:33.120 --> 3:25:37.600]  didn't come up with the Pfizer shot. They didn't come up with Bill Gates with a blood clotting agent.
[3:25:37.600 --> 3:25:42.320]  They didn't roll out this gene therapy that turns off your white blood cells. They didn't do that.
[3:25:44.640 --> 3:25:48.000]  And no wonder the white blood cells turn off. All the blood around them starts
[3:25:49.040 --> 3:25:52.400]  all the blood cells start shutting down and dying. The white blood cells like I'm dying. What's
[3:25:52.400 --> 3:25:58.240]  going on? Everything's dying. I mean this is the end of civilization. This is it folks.
[3:25:58.960 --> 3:26:01.920]  And he's up there with Bill O'Reilly, that joke.
[3:26:04.480 --> 3:26:08.240]  He's up there with him. I'm sorry. Roll the clip.
[3:26:08.960 --> 3:26:16.080]  Millions of lives worldwide. We together, all of us. Not me. We. We got a vaccine done.
[3:26:16.080 --> 3:26:21.040]  Three vaccines done. And tremendous therapeutics like Regeneron and other things that have saved
[3:26:21.040 --> 3:26:27.120]  a lot of lives. We got a vaccine done in less than nine months that was supposed to take from
[3:26:27.120 --> 3:26:33.440]  five to 12 years. Because of that vaccine. Yeah, Fauci already had it ready and months before
[3:26:33.440 --> 3:26:37.760]  COVID was even released, was preparing all the shots and telling the companies what to make.
[3:26:37.760 --> 3:26:43.840]  I mean, again, you are literally worshiping Fauci, Trump. Continue. Because of that vaccine,
[3:26:44.560 --> 3:26:49.200]  millions and millions of people. I think this would have been the Spanish flu of 1917.
[3:26:49.200 --> 3:26:55.680]  You think, huh? Up to 100 million. It is now because of ADE. People are now really sick
[3:26:55.680 --> 3:27:01.600]  and dying from it. Trump continue. People died. This was going to ravage the country far beyond
[3:27:01.600 --> 3:27:07.040]  what it is right now. Take credit for it. Take credit for it. It's a great, what we've done is
[3:27:07.040 --> 3:27:14.640]  historic. Sign on to it. Take credit for it. Take, just sign on, believe it. I mean, hell, we're
[3:27:14.640 --> 3:27:21.920]  fighting Bill Gates and Fauci and Biden and the New World Order and Saki and the Debo's group and
[3:27:21.920 --> 3:27:27.440]  Peter Dazik. And now we got Trump on their team. Let's continue. Don't let them take it away.
[3:27:27.440 --> 3:27:32.080]  Don't take it away from ourselves. You're playing that. You're playing right into their hands when
[3:27:32.080 --> 3:27:36.640]  you sort of like, oh, the vaccine. If you don't want to take it, you shouldn't be forced to take it.
[3:27:36.640 --> 3:27:43.200]  No mandates, but take credit because we saved tens of millions of lives. Take credit. Don't
[3:27:43.200 --> 3:27:48.640]  let them take that away from you. Okay. So the president made new... You agree with that? Right?
[3:27:48.640 --> 3:27:53.440]  The only thing he said true was you shouldn't have to take it. Both the president and I are
[3:27:53.440 --> 3:28:00.320]  Vax and, uh, did you get the booster? Yes. I got it too. Okay. So, uh, don't, don't, don't, don't,
[3:28:00.320 --> 3:28:07.360]  don't, don't, don't. That's a very tiny group of it. Yeah. No, no, very, I mean, look at these two.
[3:28:07.360 --> 3:28:17.360]  I'm done with Trump. So it looks like Baron Harkinen right there. So, I mean, he just totally
[3:28:17.360 --> 3:28:23.360]  destroyed himself with us. And, uh, you know, he gets to play God and sit up there and do all this
[3:28:23.360 --> 3:28:28.960]  crap and, you know, play footsie with a deep state. That's fine. Not me. I'm not with killing the kids.
[3:28:28.960 --> 3:28:33.280]  I'm not giving them poison shots. I'm not with all of it. Trump could have been the champion, but
[3:28:33.280 --> 3:28:39.920]  in my view, we just need to move on because, uh, we got the Democrats in power and they gotta be
[3:28:39.920 --> 3:28:43.840]  dealt with it. I'm still here fighting. I'm not backing down, folks. And I appreciate your support
[3:28:43.840 --> 3:28:48.640]  and your prayers. But let's pray for Trump to awaken. Let's pray that he gets out of this
[3:28:48.640 --> 3:28:51.920]  satanic spell he's under. Stop listening to Jared Kushner.
[3:28:55.440 --> 3:29:02.080]  You know, let's... Christmas Day 2021 is almost here. And I want to encourage our amazing listeners
[3:29:02.080 --> 3:29:07.920]  and viewers who have changed the world through your support of Info Wars to help take this
[3:29:07.920 --> 3:29:12.720]  fight against tyranny to the next level. And that's what Reset Wars does. We've extended the sale of
[3:29:12.720 --> 3:29:20.000]  25% off on the course. Mine Wars Spirit Wars is two courses in one until Christmas Day.
[3:29:20.640 --> 3:29:26.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, help give your friends, your family, your neighbors the gift of being aware
[3:29:26.160 --> 3:29:31.360]  of how the globalists are manipulating them and trying to break their will. And please give

[3:31:13.920 --> 3:31:19.760]  under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down. Protecting your privacy, protecting

[3:32:00.400 --> 3:32:05.840]  because it could be America's last Christmas. Evil is taking over the planet. They're destroying
[3:32:05.840 --> 3:32:10.640]  our borders, our sovereignty, our supply chains, our language, our currencies. They're coming after
[3:32:10.640 --> 3:32:16.160]  us. And if we don't support American businesses and if we don't support independent media in the
[3:32:16.160 --> 3:32:23.840]  final days of 2021, we have no future in the midterms in 2022. 2022 is the year where America
[3:32:23.840 --> 3:32:28.160]  decides its fate. I want to thank you all for your support. I want to encourage you to your
[3:32:28.160 --> 3:32:33.600]  Christmas shopping infowarstore.com because I can barely keep our operation going. And I appreciate

[3:32:50.080 --> 3:32:55.120]  store wide free shipping up until December 20th. So please take action now and keep us on the air.
[3:32:55.120 --> 3:33:09.120]  Thank you.
[3:33:09.120 --> 3:33:25.120]  Welcome back my friends.
[3:33:27.840 --> 3:33:29.520]  We're now inside the new world order.
[3:33:29.520 --> 3:33:41.520]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[3:33:53.360 --> 3:33:58.800]  All right, so if you're conscious and actually read these headlines for what they are, you'll see
[3:33:58.800 --> 3:34:06.480]  it but the general public is not conscious. Retired generals urge Pentagon to take steps to avert
[3:34:06.480 --> 3:34:19.600]  civil war after 2024 election. And they want to take those steps by having the military
[3:34:19.600 --> 3:34:26.400]  spy on the American people and basically establish public martial law. And the COVID lockdowns are
[3:34:26.400 --> 3:34:30.240]  just the training wheels to get you used to, Hey, stay in your house. Hey, you got to have a pass
[3:34:30.240 --> 3:34:36.720]  to travel. Hey, you're not essential. Hey, halt right there. This is the end of America folks.
[3:34:36.720 --> 3:34:44.720]  This is the real takeover. And I just keep telling people that and I knew this was coming. And I know
[3:34:44.720 --> 3:34:52.800]  that if the public would just wake up how incredibly serious this is all is, we wouldn't have to go
[3:34:52.800 --> 3:35:01.280]  through this. But we've had it so good. So long. We just all got that lackadaisical smile that's
[3:35:01.280 --> 3:35:10.560]  going on. That as the globalist cult comes into full power and tells you you're all suspect,
[3:35:10.560 --> 3:35:16.400]  you're all disease, you're all bad. We're just going quietly into that long night.
[3:35:16.400 --> 3:35:23.120]  And that's the way the universe works. When you've got a bunch of asleep, soft people,
[3:35:24.480 --> 3:35:34.160]  evil is going to make a major move. So retired generals urge Pentagon to take
[3:35:34.160 --> 3:35:42.400]  steps to avert civil war after 2024 election. But really, I told you this was coming that
[3:35:42.400 --> 3:35:47.040]  they would do this with this announcement. It's really for the election that's in 323 days,
[3:35:47.040 --> 3:35:53.760]  the midterms, ex army generals fear insurrection. Nobody's been charged with a premeditated
[3:35:53.760 --> 3:36:05.600]  insurrection of civil war in 2024. They warn of lethal chaos in the US military. Oh, really,
[3:36:05.600 --> 3:36:10.160]  what's what's what's coming? What's the lethal chaos? You see, they're already scripting and
[3:36:10.160 --> 3:36:19.360]  preparing you that the enemy is the American people. So what is the right response to all of this?
[3:36:20.640 --> 3:36:25.520]  The right response is to protest every day. The right response is to go make a big deal
[3:36:25.520 --> 3:36:29.840]  about this at your church. The right response is to travel and peacefully talk to members of
[3:36:29.840 --> 3:36:34.480]  Congress and your state houses. The right response is to pray to God. The right response is to call
[3:36:34.480 --> 3:36:40.400]  him to see span. The right response is to talk to your neighbors about what's going down. Because
[3:36:40.400 --> 3:36:46.480]  as a formerly free country, and nobody's faced a high tech takeover like this, this is 21st century,
[3:36:48.160 --> 3:36:55.440]  the general public doesn't know and doesn't understand what they are being hit by.
[3:36:55.440 --> 3:37:03.600]  And they just don't have any way to grasp something this organized and this committed.
[3:37:04.720 --> 3:37:12.320]  And so you will die. And I'm going to say this again. All the stuff they release and the poison
[3:37:12.320 --> 3:37:19.600]  shots and all of it is to erase your immune system because they know how powerful your immune system
[3:37:19.600 --> 3:37:29.680]  is. Everything they've done is to just practice the lockdowns and the control for once they pull
[3:37:29.680 --> 3:37:36.320]  the trigger on what is now unfolding. And I know that it sure as the sun came up and I can't get
[3:37:36.320 --> 3:37:40.960]  my family who even knows I'm right and knows what's going on. I can't get them out of their comfort
[3:37:40.960 --> 3:37:48.880]  zone. Can't get anybody I know out of it. Almost no one has the serious mind for this information.
[3:37:50.480 --> 3:38:01.520]  And so that's why we will die. And the globalist argument is we deserve it because we're so stupid
[3:38:01.520 --> 3:38:07.920]  and so sheepish and so believing and so wanting to believe they've got this answer called this
[3:38:07.920 --> 3:38:14.160]  inoculation that isn't an inoculation that is a poison gene therapy that erases our immune system.
[3:38:16.240 --> 3:38:20.800]  Our immune systems are being erased. Our borders are being erased.
[3:38:20.800 --> 3:38:26.480]  Parental rights are being erased. The value of the dollar is being erased. The power and
[3:38:26.480 --> 3:38:32.560]  superiority of our military is being erased. Our culture is being erased.
[3:38:32.560 --> 3:38:44.320]  Everything from the family to the right of self-defense to the right to elect your own local
[3:38:45.440 --> 3:38:52.160]  governance is being destroyed by these megabanks that have unlimited money and power to buy off
[3:38:52.160 --> 3:38:58.240]  anybody that'll take the money. And most people take the money because they're not even thinking
[3:38:58.240 --> 3:39:04.800]  about whether it's a payoff. It's like, you pay me, I go put this agenda out. And they all sit up
[3:39:04.800 --> 3:39:10.560]  there in gaslight. They're fellow citizens because they believe that that's a winner move, that they're
[3:39:10.560 --> 3:39:15.280]  part of the establishment. They get to go to the conferences and the meetings and they get padded
[3:39:15.280 --> 3:39:22.000]  on the head. And that may have worked for 40, 50 years while the fall of America was being prepared.
[3:39:22.000 --> 3:39:26.560]  And while you were being the lemmings and the quizlings and the traders and the sellouts and
[3:39:26.560 --> 3:39:31.840]  the suckers and the double agents, but now you're coming down to the end of the wire.
[3:39:33.120 --> 3:39:35.760]  Now you're coming down to the final point
[3:39:39.600 --> 3:39:42.960]  where the collapse takes place. And that's where we are.
[3:39:44.800 --> 3:39:52.000]  Norm Pattis joins us. We have filed the suit against the January 6th committee. It is a lengthy suit.
[3:39:52.000 --> 3:39:56.560]  It is on infowars.com and it's bigger than Alex Jones. It deals with all of your rights,
[3:39:56.560 --> 3:40:04.080]  all of your freedoms. And Norm Pattis joins us to talk about, he dropped. Okay. We're not going
[3:40:04.080 --> 3:40:10.000]  to have him on. We're going to stop at this moment and just realize that that's the way these things
[3:40:10.000 --> 3:40:17.920]  work. Because I've been waiting 30 minutes for him to come on. I don't want to, we're done. We're
[3:40:17.920 --> 3:40:24.720]  done. There's a total incompetence to society these days. And it's going to get worse. Because,
[3:40:24.720 --> 3:40:31.440]  again, once they take you out of your normal environs, growing your food, chopping your firewood,
[3:40:31.440 --> 3:40:37.040]  looking at the stars at night, playing the banjo on the back porch, once you become domesticated,
[3:40:37.040 --> 3:40:41.680]  once you're taken off the land, you're already dehumanized. And then you're brought into these
[3:40:41.680 --> 3:40:46.880]  false systems that then all fit together where they can control you and then you have no future.
[3:40:46.880 --> 3:40:55.440]  Only transcendence and understanding is all a lie and breaking where they can save you.
[3:40:56.240 --> 3:41:01.280]  That's why I'm not an enemy of the poor little sad leftists that I see following talking points
[3:41:01.280 --> 3:41:05.520]  and regurgitating them and trying to prove themselves to the establishment to be, you know,
[3:41:05.520 --> 3:41:12.640]  part of the winning team when none of it's a winning team. What it is is the end of human
[3:41:12.640 --> 3:41:20.800]  civilization as we know it. So in the last segment coming up, I'm going to get into
[3:41:23.920 --> 3:41:30.960]  fentanyl, the World Economic Forum, Jack Dorsey, and more. And I really appreciate everybody.
[3:41:31.600 --> 3:41:35.920]  You know, God's watching. And that's really what matters at the end of the day is that we're true
[3:41:35.920 --> 3:41:40.400]  and that we're good people and that we just follow through on standing up for the innocent.
[3:41:40.400 --> 3:41:47.760]  And then we follow through for this dead baby. Then the government's own reports died for the
[3:41:47.760 --> 3:41:52.320]  Moderna vaccine with blood pouring out of every war of us when it was born. Dead on arrival.
[3:41:54.800 --> 3:41:58.560]  Because that's really all God cares about is that the end of the day we
[3:41:59.760 --> 3:42:03.840]  understand what's really going on and just don't be selfish people and be connected
[3:42:04.720 --> 3:42:08.560]  and be real. But imagine being born straight into death. Well, hell, they're already killed
[3:42:08.560 --> 3:42:15.520]  67 million in the womb here in America. So now they just kill them with the shots and mommy,
[3:42:15.520 --> 3:42:20.880]  you know, mommy gets the shots and then mommy has a stillborn and they just come and tell her it's
[3:42:20.880 --> 3:42:27.040]  okay. And she just makes her way home and then she takes the next shot and the next baby dies and
[3:42:27.040 --> 3:42:36.720]  it's all just mass death. That's where we are. So I mean, you know, I get it. I'm a negative guy.
[3:42:36.720 --> 3:42:41.600]  Maybe I should just join Klaus Schwab and just kill everybody, huh? See, Klaus Schwab is already
[3:42:41.600 --> 3:42:46.800]  dead politically, spiritually. So it doesn't really matter, does it? That's where we are now,
[3:42:46.800 --> 3:42:52.240]  though. The beginning of the end times, folks. Baby Jesus needs the shots, doesn't he?
[3:42:54.880 --> 3:43:00.720]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding. So this could be literally your last chance
[3:43:00.720 --> 3:43:05.760]  with all the insane things happening in the world to get in force products and to support us
[3:43:05.760 --> 3:43:10.800]  into 2022, the do or die year. Storewide free shipping, double patriot points,

[3:43:40.400 --> 3:43:47.280]  plus the Royce for your cells and immune systems, 40% off info or store.com. This could be
[3:43:47.280 --> 3:43:52.160]  potentially your last chance to get a t-shirt, a book, a film or these great supplements.
[3:43:52.160 --> 3:43:54.640]  We're going to keep going 110%, but we need your support.
[3:43:54.640 --> 3:44:05.760]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change
[3:44:06.480 --> 3:44:11.440]  that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations has put in place.
[3:44:12.080 --> 3:44:18.720]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will ever emerge. It is the symbol that
[3:44:18.720 --> 3:44:25.200]  we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal faces from the light of the
[3:44:25.200 --> 3:44:34.640]  sun. It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil. Ladies and gentlemen,
[3:44:35.520 --> 3:44:41.600]  we are crossing the Rubicon now. The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[3:44:41.600 --> 3:44:45.440]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of the
[3:44:45.440 --> 3:44:51.840]  world ID and carbon taxes. Things only get worse from here if we submit. They only get better if we
[3:44:51.840 --> 3:44:55.840]  resist and say no. Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[3:44:58.080 --> 3:45:03.120]  This could be in full worse last Christmas because it could be America's last Christmas.
[3:45:03.680 --> 3:45:07.600]  Evil is taking over the planet. They're destroying our borders, our sovereignty,
[3:45:07.600 --> 3:45:12.960]  our supply chains, our language, our currencies. They're coming after us. And if we don't support
[3:45:12.960 --> 3:45:18.160]  American businesses and if we don't support independent media in the final days of 2021,
[3:45:18.160 --> 3:45:25.760]  we have no future in the midterms in 2022. 2022 is the year where America decides its fate.
[3:45:25.760 --> 3:45:29.600]  I want to thank you all for your support. I want to encourage you to your Christmas shopping
[3:45:29.600 --> 3:45:34.320]  and then FullerStore.com because I can barely keep our operation going. And I appreciate you
[3:45:34.320 --> 3:45:38.880]  keeping us in the position to fight back. I am so thankful for you. And I'm asking you now to
[3:45:38.880 --> 3:45:44.320]  realize the huge investment you made over the years in us and I'll redouble your efforts to make sure

[3:45:55.680 --> 3:46:01.600]  Thank you. UN run contact tracers aren't coming. They're here all over the world from Australia
[3:46:01.600 --> 3:46:06.160]  to the United States from Canada to Germany. These tyrants are tracking everything you do
[3:46:06.160 --> 3:46:10.720]  everywhere you go and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases actually taking
[3:46:10.720 --> 3:46:16.720]  people away into the night to their facilities. And they're planning in the next year to expand
[3:46:16.720 --> 3:46:21.920]  their shield process where they come and take quote healthy people away and put them in facilities
[3:46:21.920 --> 3:46:26.640]  for their safety. This is nothing less than martial law. And one big thing you can do to fight back
[3:46:26.640 --> 3:46:31.120]  is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very
[3:46:31.120 --> 3:46:37.520]  compliant meaning us government military grade at infowarstore.com. We have the entire line of

[3:47:24.640 --> 3:47:31.840]  You know, as bummed out as I get about all the evil taking place, at least their busts in the
[3:47:31.840 --> 3:47:38.880]  munch of CNN producers for the pedophiles they are. At least that Jeffrey Epstein sick
[3:47:39.520 --> 3:47:46.080]  Mossad MI6 girlfriend is in jail, huh? At least that's happening. We got this going on too,
[3:47:46.080 --> 3:47:51.600]  it's official Durham is investigating the Clinton campaign. Think so? They made up the whole
[3:47:51.600 --> 3:47:57.920]  Russiagate crap with that Adam Schiff person. And then we've also got, pull up the CNN headline for
[3:47:57.920 --> 3:48:06.240]  me guys, Alex Jones, Sue's House January 6th committee. So that information is breaking.
[3:48:06.800 --> 3:48:13.840]  Conspiracy theorist and right wing provocateur, can you put a few extra little things up front?
[3:48:15.360 --> 3:48:19.680]  Having these criminals write that about me is beautiful. Conspiracy theorist and right wing
[3:48:19.680 --> 3:48:25.360]  provocateur Alex Jones says he will not comply with demands the House select committee investigating
[3:48:25.360 --> 3:48:31.760]  January 6th is made for his testimony and records according to a new lawsuit he filed today.
[3:48:32.560 --> 3:48:36.960]  The committee has called Jones to testify on January 10th according to the lawsuit.
[3:48:36.960 --> 3:48:43.040]  Jones attempt to drag the House investigation into court follows other legal challenges from
[3:48:43.040 --> 3:48:50.400]  witnesses. Congressional investigators have pursued including Mark Meadows, Ali Alexander,
[3:48:50.400 --> 3:48:58.160]  though Jones aims in the suit at much broader than theirs. The story is breaking and will be updated.
[3:49:01.840 --> 3:49:04.880]  And you just go back to the headline. I want to read that part 13 in again, please.
[3:49:04.880 --> 3:49:15.840]  Though Jones aims in the suit are much broader than theirs. My aims like, hey, I'm a journalist.
[3:49:16.560 --> 3:49:21.680]  Hey, I'm on record what I did. Hey, the committee supposed to have this many Republicans on it,
[3:49:21.680 --> 3:49:26.800]  but doesn't. I mean, that's the law, but they don't care, ladies and gentlemen. Kind of like,
[3:49:26.800 --> 3:49:31.600]  oh, you're supposed to get a jury trial in a civil suit over the Democrat judges in Austin,
[3:49:31.600 --> 3:49:36.720]  the Soros lady and the other one up in Connecticut. They say, oh, you don't get a jury trial on
[3:49:36.720 --> 3:49:41.520]  damages. You don't get a jury trial on whether you're guilty or not. We just decide how much money you
[3:49:41.520 --> 3:49:46.800]  owe your own to these people. I mean, it's just, it's all a joke. People are like, well, how are
[3:49:46.800 --> 3:49:50.640]  you taking it? I'm not a lot better than these small children get the shots and having heart attacks
[3:49:50.640 --> 3:49:54.240]  and dying. I'll tell you that. I mean, I mean, we're getting our asses kicked here. The whole
[3:49:54.240 --> 3:50:00.800]  damn country. Yes. Yes, I'm doing. I'm a grown man. I mean, this ain't fun, but the worst parts
[3:50:00.800 --> 3:50:06.160]  watching the children and Trump parading around signed on to this whole thing really got me down
[3:50:06.160 --> 3:50:16.320]  today. I'll be honest about it. You know, the worst part about this is I really want to go after
[3:50:16.320 --> 3:50:22.080]  Trump and I'm not a Machiavellian person, but when I go after Trump, they're going to say, oh, he's
[3:50:22.080 --> 3:50:26.560]  doing it because he's scared of January 6. I've already seen that when I criticize Trump. They go
[3:50:26.560 --> 3:50:32.800]  all over Twitter and Facebook and the news. Oh, look, he's scared. He's singing. Oh, oh, he's
[3:50:32.800 --> 3:50:38.320]  criticizing Trump. So the Jan 6 committee leaves him alone. That's not how this works with these
[3:50:38.320 --> 3:50:43.680]  criminals. You look at Michael Cohen, rolling over to them to tell all these lies and stuff,
[3:50:43.680 --> 3:50:49.040]  and they charged him doesn't work. I don't sit there and calculate in my brain about what's
[3:50:49.040 --> 3:50:53.440]  better for me. I try to do what the right thing is. I know everybody else thinks that's weird
[3:50:53.440 --> 3:51:00.320]  in the power structure, but that's that's how this country was built, was real simple. Like,
[3:51:00.320 --> 3:51:08.560]  is this the reasonable thing to do? The only reason I haven't gone after Trump more,
[3:51:09.120 --> 3:51:14.640]  and I'm just not realizing this as I was speaking, is that I don't want them to say they drove me
[3:51:14.640 --> 3:51:20.640]  to it. Fine, I support Trump. I think he's a wonderful person. He's not like a big fat
[3:51:20.640 --> 3:51:27.680]  demonic penguin up there. He's a good man. And, and, and yes, we should all take the shots. And
[3:51:28.320 --> 3:51:32.480]  even though they're experimental and don't work in a race or immune system, yes, I'm not attacking
[3:51:32.480 --> 3:51:38.880]  Trump because he's a horrible sellout to the system and signed on to giant depopulation. And
[3:51:38.880 --> 3:51:47.040]  it's now Donald Joseph Mengele of Trump or Donald the doctor Mengele of Trump. No, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:51:47.040 --> 3:51:52.160]  I'm doing it so the liberals will be nice to me. That's why I took the jobs at CNN. It's
[3:51:52.160 --> 3:51:57.280]  why I took the job at Fox. It's why I want to know I don't want to be in New York or LA. I don't
[3:51:57.280 --> 3:52:02.400]  want to be around Adam Schiff. I don't want to be around all the pervert producers and pedophiles.
[3:52:02.400 --> 3:52:06.880]  I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't care about Trump. I don't care about Marlago. I don't
[3:52:06.880 --> 3:52:12.960]  care about tuxedos. I don't care about acting trendy. I want to be a good person. And that's
[3:52:12.960 --> 3:52:20.400]  why the new Spider-Man villain is Alex Jones, who's a horrible lying fake newsman that get ready
[3:52:20.400 --> 3:52:26.000]  for this tells you you need vitamin D3. What a devil. I mean, I'm going to sell something like
[3:52:26.000 --> 3:52:30.160]  what do they need? They need clean water. They go find the best water filtration system at the
[3:52:30.160 --> 3:52:35.760]  best price. Well, they need vitamin D3. Well, they need PQQ. Well, they need turmeric. What's the
[3:52:35.760 --> 3:52:40.880]  best turmeric you got? Okay. I mean, everything would be what I thought everybody was like me
[3:52:40.880 --> 3:52:46.400]  and my family. I know our audiences, but I mean, like we just are nice people and, you know,
[3:52:47.840 --> 3:52:51.440]  over my life, I like inviting people over to dinner, make them this big dinner, take care of them,
[3:52:51.440 --> 3:52:55.120]  be nice to them. And they say like, they're like, what is it you want? Well, why are you,
[3:52:55.680 --> 3:53:01.840]  why are you being nice to me? And I get it, their mother put them in a crib, didn't even give them
[3:53:01.840 --> 3:53:08.560]  enough milk. And they just lived in a crib watching TV. And that's why they can't believe there's
[3:53:08.560 --> 3:53:13.280]  people like me that I got all the milk I wanted. I got all the love I wanted. I got everything.
[3:53:14.160 --> 3:53:17.440]  And my ancestors got everything. They just got everything. They just built it all. They just,
[3:53:17.440 --> 3:53:24.320]  they just, and I get it now. I get it. Klaus Schwab needs to kill everybody because the public
[3:53:24.320 --> 3:53:32.240]  is scum. I'm serious. And he's the worst. He'll go too. Don't worry. He'll be clawed back down into
[3:53:32.240 --> 3:53:37.280]  the thing he's setting up. And so will Bill Gates. And I'm not even up here like I'm some
[3:53:37.280 --> 3:53:41.920]  wonderful, perfect person. The fact that I have knowledge of evil makes me guilty. And I'll tell
[3:53:41.920 --> 3:53:46.320]  you I'm not a perfect person. But you know, they're murdering children with an experimental
[3:53:46.320 --> 3:53:53.040]  injection all around us and doing this. And what are we doing to stop it? Because if that piece
[3:53:53.040 --> 3:54:03.120]  of garbage, Klaus Schwab, is ruling us and gaming us and scamming us, and we decide spiritually
[3:54:03.120 --> 3:54:07.760]  to listen to what he's doing and take our newborn babies in like liberals do, you see them on TV
[3:54:07.760 --> 3:54:14.640]  like literally having sexual anxiety while their child's being injected. I'm liberal. I'm sacrificing
[3:54:14.640 --> 3:54:21.840]  my child to this. It's sick. I want to go war on the leftist in Austin as I did 20 months ago and 10
[3:54:21.840 --> 3:54:25.520]  months ago and six months ago and a month ago about, hey, the shot's deadly. It raises your
[3:54:25.520 --> 3:54:29.360]  immune system. It doesn't protect you. They're just going to scream at me. I'm going to go down there
[3:54:29.360 --> 3:54:36.000]  then. That's few days. I'm serious. And I'm going to say thank you for being heroes. Take your shots.
[3:54:36.000 --> 3:54:42.880]  Take extra. Oh, because there's too many people. Thank you for having the courage to sterilize
[3:54:42.880 --> 3:54:48.000]  yourself and give yourself heart attacks. And yeah, your children come from you, the few that
[3:54:48.000 --> 3:54:53.040]  have had children. They're trash too. They genetically deserve to die. Oh, the Nazis had to
[3:54:53.040 --> 3:54:56.160]  hurt people in and shoot them in the back of the head and kill them. But you do it to your own
[3:54:56.160 --> 3:55:02.240]  children. Thank you for your courage to realize your trash. Thank you for realizing your subhuman
[3:55:02.240 --> 3:55:09.600]  garbage. Murder yourselves. Murder yourselves. Murder yourselves. Murder yourselves. I'm going
[3:55:09.600 --> 3:55:19.200]  to do it. Oh, yes. Oh, wear your mask. Take your extra shots. You're a hero. Oh, take five and give
[3:55:19.200 --> 3:55:23.600]  them to your baby and then get attention when they're in a coffin and everybody will feel sorry for
[3:55:23.600 --> 3:55:27.440]  that's all you want. You don't want a relationship with your child. You want to get off on the attention
[3:55:27.440 --> 3:55:34.640]  you get when they die, don't you? Oh, God, you're so good. It's so much Bill Gates. Bill Gates inject
[3:55:34.640 --> 3:55:42.320]  me. Oh, Fauci. Oh, Fauci said I can't have my family over if they're not injected. That's not creepy
[3:55:42.320 --> 3:55:55.840]  at all. I agree with Fauci. I agree with Bill Gates. Yes. Yes. Yes. Take your injections.
[3:55:58.080 --> 3:56:06.000]  It's so liberal. I'll be better tomorrow. I just seeing Trump do that really put me the next level
[3:56:06.000 --> 3:56:10.720]  and so much stuff going on and the war rooms coming up. Owen was in his criminal case in court
[3:56:10.720 --> 3:56:15.520]  right now so he can't do his show and his colors can't anymore because he got indicted and convicted
[3:56:15.520 --> 3:56:20.160]  but you know it's okay. The Tim Cook runs death camps because you know why, right? He wears a
[3:56:20.160 --> 3:56:23.840]  black turtle neck. That makes it look like he runs death camps but he wears a black turtle neck.
[3:56:23.840 --> 3:56:32.320]  Okay. Trust the science. Trust the science. Trust the science. Ha ha. Trust the science
[3:56:32.320 --> 3:56:39.840]  that you don't need to be on this planet according to them. Now seriously, the war rooms coming up
