[00:57.960 --> 01:04.640]  getting to it later in the hour a animal shelter took in a baby deer so they
[01:04.640 --> 01:11.000]  SWAT teamed them because they put a YouTube video out about it and a bunch
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.960]  of good neighbors tattled on them that was supposedly illegal and so they came
[01:14.960 --> 01:19.040]  and killed the baby deer and put it in a body bag armed agents raid animal

[03:24.880 --> 03:28.960]  point I told you they arrest you in England for using the word homosexual

[03:33.000 --> 03:37.920]  Caucasian Negro all that supposedly is racist there's white groups that don't
[03:37.920 --> 03:41.080]  want the word Caucasian use they say it's hurtful these are just these are

[08:57.360 --> 09:02.680]  London Telegraph research of 97 percent we actually already knew this but I'm
[09:02.680 --> 09:07.240]  glad he did the research 97 it was more than I thought I thought it was around
[09:07.240 --> 09:12.160]  90 because I found a few small oil companies that weren't funding it 97
[09:12.160 --> 09:17.080]  percent of the climate change global warming fanatics are funded by oil
[09:17.080 --> 09:22.000]  companies we'll be explaining why that is when you say listen I don't think we
[09:22.000 --> 09:26.200]  should shut down all our power plants they're totally clean China has dirty
[09:26.200 --> 09:30.720]  ones we can't compete shut up shut up you work for the oil companies well
[09:30.720 --> 09:34.680]  actually I don't work for the oil companies I work for common sense and
[09:34.680 --> 09:39.240]  having an industry in this country so that's going to be coming up so
[09:39.240 --> 09:52.280]  incredibly so incredibly important now we have huge news on the science front
[09:52.280 --> 10:04.880]  massive news on the Benghazi front as well and huge news on the BBC and the
[10:04.880 --> 10:08.720]  British government pedophile front that I've got to get to because I had this
[10:08.720 --> 10:11.800]  news yesterday Morris come out today and I didn't cover it because I kind of
[10:11.800 --> 10:15.640]  psychologically shy away from this it's so horrific I'm not a big fan of horror
[10:15.640 --> 10:19.640]  movies either I don't just like horror for our sake and it's very upsetting
[10:19.640 --> 10:23.640]  we're going to cover it celebrity arrest could soar after horrified police
[10:23.640 --> 10:29.080]  discovered Jimmy Savelle secret lair secret room at record shop this is the
[10:29.080 --> 10:33.640]  guy who was the most trusted confidant of the royal family including the Queen
[10:33.640 --> 10:39.480]  of England and there is a reason all of this is coming out now undoubtedly this
[10:39.480 --> 10:44.360]  has been known for decades they are blackmailing the British royalty to fully
[10:44.360 --> 10:51.120]  sign all their power over to the Rothschild Rockefeller bank combine so
[10:51.120 --> 10:56.520]  this is the true fall of the House of Windsor you're seeing right now with the
[10:56.520 --> 11:00.200]  blackmail and you're also seeing the globalist move on Rupert Murdoch with
[11:00.200 --> 11:03.880]  the hacking scandal threatening to arrest him if he doesn't basically submit
[11:03.880 --> 11:12.240]  to their takeover so this is very serious information going on right now and
[11:12.240 --> 11:15.880]  I'm going to be breaking that down as well also I've been telling you about
[11:15.880 --> 11:22.880]  this for really about 17 18 years on air but I learned about it a few years under
[11:22.880 --> 11:30.240]  the broadcast and that's plastic chemical BPA may harm human fertility and
[11:30.240 --> 11:34.760]  cause cancer and that's a news study a big scientific study at the reporting on
[11:34.760 --> 11:42.160]  on Fox News that's today the answer of course by White House run MSNBC will
[11:42.160 --> 11:44.960]  be to come out and say that I say that they're making people gay with juice
[11:44.960 --> 11:53.360]  boxes when what I actually said and what I actually covered was the fact that it
[11:53.360 --> 11:59.720]  also has that side effect so we're going to be going over that report as well
[11:59.720 --> 12:08.800]  also here's a CNN headline today your TV might be watching you oh really I told
[12:08.800 --> 12:14.680]  people this 16 years ago when I was visited by a Time Warner high level
[12:14.680 --> 12:18.800]  I'm not gonna say how high level they can go back to the time to figure out who
[12:18.800 --> 12:23.560]  it was but a high-level engineer in Time Warner in Central Texas and when I
[12:23.560 --> 12:27.600]  broke the news that the televisions had hidden microphones and it's some even
[12:27.600 --> 12:33.920]  had hidden cameras I was given death threats and I mean the type where they
[12:33.920 --> 12:43.280]  tell you what your girlfriend had for lunch that kind where they have you
[12:43.280 --> 12:46.680]  know private goons following you around and things they did not want this out at
[12:46.680 --> 12:52.880]  that time now it's time to roll it out to the slaves so they're singing in told
[12:52.880 --> 12:55.920]  you so again and again I'm on up here every day going told you so told you so
[12:55.920 --> 13:00.720]  told you so told you so told you so told you so told you show about my ego okay
[13:00.720 --> 13:06.320]  in fact this is scary to know that I know their program very well better than
[13:06.320 --> 13:12.520]  almost anybody on air I've spent my life trying to discover reality not not not
[13:12.520 --> 13:19.400]  the fiction that's put out as the cover medium and I know their program most of
[13:19.400 --> 13:22.400]  it they've they've put down in books and white papers and conferences they've
[13:22.400 --> 13:31.080]  had on record I mean it's just mind-boggling to know what their public plan is
[13:31.080 --> 13:37.760]  and to know how horrific it is and now to see it moving ahead and to still be
[13:37.760 --> 13:41.640]  attacked by people that work for the establishment you know they've got a lot
[13:41.640 --> 13:46.080]  of operatives in every major news network and every major newspaper on
[13:46.080 --> 13:50.880]  record since media got going in this country but it's intensified in the
[13:50.880 --> 13:55.160]  last few decades because previously people involved in psyopsin propaganda in
[13:55.160 --> 13:58.720]  media thought they were doing it for liberty and freedom and so there was
[13:58.720 --> 14:04.120]  some restraint involved it was still immoral the road to hell paved by that
[14:04.120 --> 14:09.480]  type of thing but now it's just pure cynical mercenaries who will do anything
[14:09.480 --> 14:15.000]  they're told and that's the nature historically of tyranny is that it just
[14:15.000 --> 14:18.640]  progresses by increment till the bottom falls out but when you see the
[14:18.640 --> 14:23.400]  announcement of the Pentagon and the CIA and the White House to give tens of
[14:23.400 --> 14:27.520]  billions of dollars to every major media outlet and at the Pentagon openly try to
[14:27.520 --> 14:34.000]  buy off even small bloggers to stir up infighting and disinfo the fact that
[14:34.000 --> 14:37.280]  they're mainlining that announcement is an attempt so that when it comes out
[14:37.280 --> 14:41.800]  they're doing it it isn't like ooh we caught the army planting fake news it's
[14:41.800 --> 14:47.520]  that well that's no big deal it's to inoculate psychologically because you
[14:47.520 --> 14:55.320]  see they can't just have their their 20 or so I'm estimating at the Washington
[14:55.320 --> 15:00.680]  Post that are naval intelligence and and CIA and then Ford Foundation above
[15:00.680 --> 15:05.560]  intelligence agencies foundation operatives that way there's no government
[15:05.560 --> 15:11.480]  oversight and they've I mean I know about 20 known operatives at the Washington
[15:11.480 --> 15:17.480]  Post currently Bob Woodward naval intelligence I mean the list goes on and on
[15:17.480 --> 15:25.000]  Bernstein CIA probably like that announcement the point is is that
[15:25.000 --> 15:29.600]  things like that are going on and then you've got seeing in that's been the
[15:29.600 --> 15:34.400]  model since Ted Turner launched it with military satellites to broadcast the
[15:34.400 --> 15:39.760]  video feeds is CIA a hundred percent up one side down the other MSNBC is like
[15:39.760 --> 15:44.840]  Foundation Ford Foundation Carnegie Rockefeller Endowment White House State
[15:44.840 --> 15:50.560]  Department I mean different agencies get different media ops it's like they
[15:50.560 --> 15:55.160]  you know they divide okay you manage this one you manage that one Fox News is
[15:55.160 --> 16:05.160]  kind of like the Republicanoid heritage Foundation management arm situation to
[16:05.160 --> 16:08.480]  kind of control the right wing but now it's time to get rid of that so they're
[16:08.480 --> 16:11.680]  figuring out is you know that there's gonna be no room at the top for them
[16:11.680 --> 16:20.520]  this is a purely socialist communist system in its in its prime vein so now
[16:20.520 --> 16:24.320]  this whole mainlining this whole announcement of this happening is just
[16:24.320 --> 16:28.760]  so it can be oh hi guys here's somebody from the White House of the Department
[16:28.760 --> 16:33.720]  of Defense or the CIA and all the women blush who isn't he handsome yeah I'm here
[16:33.720 --> 16:37.360]  to help you where to work with the public work with America and here's
[16:37.360 --> 16:43.280]  Colonel Johnson you know one morning you know from the army he's just a
[16:43.280 --> 16:46.520]  mainline that you're gonna work right this is the takeover this is the full
[16:46.520 --> 16:49.760]  takeover because they don't want to just have their people that they then put on
[16:49.760 --> 16:53.880]  TV and the reporters that they magnify and the reporters that they give all the
[16:53.880 --> 16:58.720]  attention so that so that all the junior reporters mimic what the operation
[16:58.720 --> 17:03.600]  mockingbird operatives do that doesn't work anymore they need everybody at the
[17:03.600 --> 17:08.680]  Austin American statesmen and everybody at the New York Times and everybody at
[17:08.680 --> 17:15.360]  the LA Times and everybody at the local TV station to pull as one and to say
[17:15.360 --> 17:19.240]  yeah we got orders directly from the government and they direct what you're

[24:40.680 --> 24:44.360]  geopolitical news and then in the next segment I'll get into the political
[24:44.360 --> 24:48.800]  correctness that is designed to basically paralyze everyone
[24:48.800 --> 24:56.160]  intellectually and then attached to that psychological phobia to to to to upset

[25:21.680 --> 25:27.520]  us oh look you said you have a brown bag special that's meant to be racist and
[25:27.520 --> 25:32.840]  people go what you're you're joking and they go no I'm not racist that teapot
[25:32.840 --> 25:37.680]  looks like Hitler we're gonna get to that but first look at this article this
[25:37.680 --> 25:42.680]  is out of the London Telegraph a year after we told you we told you this
[25:42.680 --> 25:46.240]  within a week and we told you this in the first month and we have all the
[25:46.240 --> 25:51.360]  articles we wrote and all the guests we had on CIA running arms smuggling team
[25:51.360 --> 25:57.720]  in Benghazi when Consulate was attacked that's right they wanted to get rid of
[25:57.720 --> 26:03.640]  the substation safe house that had a huge warehouse behind it full of heat
[26:03.640 --> 26:09.480]  seeking missiles and heavy and medium arms folks this came out day one just
[26:09.480 --> 26:14.960]  like they blew up the 23 Navy Seals and then some of them lived on the ground and
[26:14.960 --> 26:18.160]  had contractors kill them to get rid of the witnesses that there was no bin
[26:18.160 --> 26:23.280]  Laden raid it was all fake there was a raid there but it wasn't who they said
[26:23.280 --> 26:26.920]  and there was no body on the ship and that's now come out there was no burial
[26:26.920 --> 26:31.080]  and they've classified even from above top secret in the Pentagon anyone being
[26:31.080 --> 26:35.520]  able to see those reports you can't see the report of the down seals you can't
[26:35.520 --> 26:40.320]  see the report of the bin Laden because there is no report it's fake ladies and
[26:40.320 --> 26:44.720]  gentlemen and the families are now coming out and saying that and they can't
[26:44.720 --> 26:51.800]  kill all of them oh the CIA had been subjecting operatives to monthly
[26:51.800 --> 26:55.880]  polygraph test in an attempt to suppress details of a US arms smuggling
[26:55.880 --> 27:01.160]  operation in Benghazi that was ongoing when its ambassador was killed by a mob
[27:01.160 --> 27:07.400]  in the city last year yeah that was the hired security for Benghazi that was the
[27:07.400 --> 27:13.160]  main command base in the year-plus war to overtake Gaddafi using al-Qaeda up to
[27:13.160 --> 27:17.080]  35 CIA operatives were working in the city during the attack like September on
[27:17.080 --> 27:20.800]  US Consulate that result in the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three
[27:20.800 --> 27:23.800]  other Americans well yeah they had checkpoints down the street trying to
[27:23.800 --> 27:27.240]  catch the people that got away they didn't want any witnesses getting away
[27:27.240 --> 27:34.000]  they were directing the al-Qaeda forces to kill everyone so there would be no
[27:34.000 --> 27:39.320]  witnesses as to who gave them the heat-seeking missiles because they're
[27:39.320 --> 27:43.720]  going to let al-Qaeda shoot down aircraft all over western world and they're
[27:43.720 --> 27:46.640]  going to set up checkpoints and they're gonna take our rights and it won't
[27:46.640 --> 27:50.240]  matter when I get on the air and I'm even around at that time and say our
[27:50.240 --> 27:53.480]  government gave them the heat-seekers they will call me a traitor and say why
[27:53.480 --> 28:00.120]  do you support al-Qaeda and I'll go no our government gave it our government
[28:00.120 --> 28:04.400]  did it shut up traitor what are you inside job people talking about well we're
[28:04.400 --> 28:12.760]  talking about criminal elements in our own government that are getting power out
[28:12.760 --> 28:16.560]  of this this is elementary trillions of no-bed weapons contracts taking all of
[28:16.560 --> 28:20.240]  our rights making it national security where the trillions in missing Pentagon
[28:20.240 --> 28:24.440]  funds are able to have rendition aircraft that fly people out for torture and
[28:24.440 --> 28:31.120]  drugs back in that have crashed before and been in Reuters this is a bunch of
[28:31.120 --> 28:37.840]  hardcore killers above the law run by private banks and foundations that are
[28:37.840 --> 28:42.040]  fundamentally anti-human and say that they are eugenicists that want to
[28:42.040 --> 28:45.800]  basically enslave humanity I've got articles on that from DARPA DARPA to
[28:45.800 --> 28:50.080]  genetically engineered humans by adding 47th chromosome and they're gonna roll
[28:50.080 --> 28:56.520]  them out on the streets and get this you're racist if you say it's bad to do
[28:56.520 --> 28:59.920]  by the way you know how they have had human clones for more than 20 years on
[28:59.920 --> 29:04.480]  record oh yeah they just don't call them humans because they're less than 1%
[29:04.480 --> 29:09.520]  altered with animal or insect or plant DNA and then they say they kill them
[29:09.520 --> 29:14.400]  before the embryos grow to full term in the cow uteruses you may have heard
[29:14.400 --> 29:17.920]  lately oh they're gonna be able to grow human organs in cow uteruses I read in
[29:17.920 --> 29:23.200]  the BBC 16 years ago about that and they were talking about it going on a decade
[29:23.200 --> 29:31.720]  before so 26 years I mean I read 15 years ago about South Korea and Hong Kong
[29:31.720 --> 29:36.480]  and other areas of Asia in Hong Kong and then in China but also South Korea
[29:36.480 --> 29:43.080]  where you can buy glow-in-the-dark monkeys that are part jellyfish we ought

[33:38.160 --> 33:44.440]  developed technologies they say themselves 30 to 50 years advanced than
[33:44.440 --> 33:49.960]  what the public knows in the national security complex 26 years ago
[33:49.960 --> 33:54.440]  humanoids were being grown in the uteruses of cows the guys just search
[33:54.440 --> 33:58.400]  the glow-in-the-dark part jellyfish monkeys will put those on screen for
[33:58.400 --> 34:06.040]  viewers there they are that's the sunday mercury newspaper and there is the
[34:06.040 --> 34:10.360]  glow-in-the-dark monkey last time I checked they're coming out with monkeys
[34:10.360 --> 34:15.840]  with gills that can live in a fish tank there's glow-in-the-dark rats and a
[34:15.840 --> 34:21.760]  glow-in-the-dark rabbits and the issue here is ladies and gentlemen this is
[34:21.760 --> 34:28.280]  old technology this was in the late 1990s being sold like something on a
[34:28.280 --> 34:35.880]  Blade Runner on the streets in Asia and every time I talk about it we see
[34:35.880 --> 34:39.960]  comments on info wars and on YouTube saying I'm a liar look I'm not a liar
[34:39.960 --> 34:46.080]  okay and you need to understand folks that they've already developed bio
[34:46.080 --> 34:52.440]  weapons and released the way that it can be designed by a average level bio
[34:52.440 --> 34:59.360]  chemist for about a hundred thousand dollars the FBI even complained about
[34:59.360 --> 35:03.560]  this a few years ago and all over the world universities in the US Europe and
[35:03.560 --> 35:10.600]  Australia released different mouse pox calculations and basically recipes to
[35:10.600 --> 35:16.240]  make a human mouse pox that kills 98% of humans and they put out how to make it
[35:16.240 --> 35:21.240]  and when people become decadent and become evil they start getting into
[35:21.240 --> 35:27.800]  nihilism and being destroyed was it Nero that finally committed suicide because
[35:27.800 --> 35:31.280]  he'd already purged his family and burned down part of the city for fun and
[35:31.280 --> 35:35.520]  just went the last thing he could do to be destructive was to kill himself and
[35:35.520 --> 35:41.960]  and I wish the globalist would just skip directly you know past the whole
[35:41.960 --> 35:46.040]  monopoly board and go right to killing themselves instead of everybody else
[35:46.040 --> 35:49.240]  along with them because they say they're trying to save the earth why they
[35:49.240 --> 35:53.000]  want to put us in coffin apartments and totally control us and shoot us up with
[35:53.000 --> 35:57.560]  stuff the three there's there a bunch of demons who'd like to hurt creation okay

[38:25.560 --> 38:35.040]  political correctness you remember last week I took a photo of one of my
[38:35.040 --> 38:43.040]  French Bulldogs captain who is white and brown and gray they call it blue the
[38:43.040 --> 38:49.400]  captain is a five-year-old French Bulldog and he likes everybody I
[38:49.400 --> 38:54.960]  promise he's not a racist but we're thinking about just to prove that we're
[38:54.960 --> 39:00.440]  not racist you know we're thinking about having him shaved because he does
[39:00.440 --> 39:07.400]  have some black fur on his front lip that that that that makes him look a
[39:07.400 --> 39:11.680]  little bit like Hitler folks and my wife first pointed out a few years ago that
[39:11.680 --> 39:15.840]  he looks like Hitler even the eyes he is very Hitler like and not in his
[39:15.840 --> 39:19.920]  behavior very sweet very loving and likes everybody but that that's only on
[39:19.920 --> 39:24.680]  the surface we all know that like the teapot the JC Penney band earlier this
[39:24.680 --> 39:28.120]  year that looked nothing like Hitler but the handle looked like the hair I
[39:28.120 --> 39:34.160]  guess an around handle for the top looked like looked like a mustache looks
[39:34.160 --> 39:39.560]  nothing like it of course and I guess a bronze bell looks like Hitler too so so
[39:39.560 --> 39:43.560]  that's been banned and destroyed and they've apologized by the way for me
[39:43.560 --> 39:46.720]  like we saw a cloud that looked like an elephant or a giraffe we know that's
[39:46.720 --> 39:54.640]  racist too so I apologized last week for Hitler dog on air of course I was not
[39:54.640 --> 39:59.760]  being totally sarcastic ladies and gentlemen we later found news articles
[39:59.760 --> 40:04.160]  where people had pointed out that their neighbor's cat looked like Hitler and
[40:04.160 --> 40:07.440]  were were disturbed because it happened to have a black spot on its head that
[40:07.440 --> 40:11.240]  looked like Hitler's air and happened to have some black fur and so should there
[40:11.240 --> 40:17.880]  be a nationwide move to euthanize I mean should I euthanize captain should
[40:17.880 --> 40:23.320]  I should people euthanize maybe maybe a white cat is racist we get rid of them
[40:23.320 --> 40:27.520]  I mean why stop there because listen I'm not joking last week saying that's
[40:27.520 --> 40:30.920]  where political correctness went because they have to get you totally obsessed
[40:30.920 --> 40:35.800]  with the fact that you've been bad they have to get you obsessed with the fact
[40:35.800 --> 40:40.040]  that that using the word homosexual is against gay people so you get arrested
[40:40.040 --> 40:45.360]  in England I had the BBC reporter on Robin Page who was by the way kind of a
[40:45.360 --> 40:48.920]  liberal but gave a speech saying rural communities deserve the same rights as
[40:48.920 --> 40:53.720]  homosexuals and Muslims he was arrested and and they have people in cafes
[40:53.720 --> 40:58.520]  listening for racism but when the government kills a million Iraqis
[40:58.520 --> 41:01.400]  that's not racist or when Margaret Sanger says we got to kill the blacks
[41:01.400 --> 41:05.640]  that's why we have abortion that's not racist real racism when I heard a local
[41:05.640 --> 41:09.720]  talk show host yesterday say it's time to sterilize all the poor people including
[41:09.720 --> 41:13.840]  the other minorities especially that's all liberal oh you're live so you're
[41:13.840 --> 41:18.960]  worried about a teapot and a French bulldog but we you wanted blacks are you
[41:18.960 --> 41:25.280]  know bad gene pools because I have the state board when Susanna Hupp a few
[41:25.280 --> 41:30.520]  years ago the state rep was in my film in-game blueprint for global
[41:30.520 --> 41:34.400]  enslavement the actual clip from the state of Texas TV I mean and they had
[41:34.400 --> 41:38.480]  the head of the psychiatry board on and they say blacks have bad gene pools
[41:38.480 --> 41:42.760]  that's why we have them was like more than 80% of blacks in foster care on
[41:42.760 --> 41:46.960]  psychotropic on average seven on average everybody at 67% or about two
[41:46.960 --> 41:50.840]  thirds and they said these people if you're poor you come from bad gene pools
[41:50.840 --> 41:54.600]  and so we have to drug you no judge no jury no nothing anti-psychotics for
[41:54.600 --> 41:57.760]  three-year-olds that brain damage them because you know blacks have bad gene
[41:57.760 --> 42:02.120]  pools so if you say blacks don't have good genes well that's well oh well
[42:02.120 --> 42:05.640]  that's fine you want to kill them oh well that's reasonable but if it's a
[42:05.640 --> 42:12.360]  teapot whoa it looks like Hitler they are creating mass mental illness in the
[42:12.360 --> 42:19.000]  public so so see I'm not really joking about my dog being Hitler because if
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.560]  they can convince people he's Hitler he is that learn what to be burned at the
[42:22.560 --> 42:26.880]  stake maybe he's a witch have a witch burning you know we'll tie rocks to him
[42:26.880 --> 42:30.360]  and throw him into the water and then if he drowns we can bury him a Christian
[42:30.360 --> 42:37.560]  burial because he's a you know he's a he's a a non-Hitler but if he is a
[42:37.560 --> 42:40.280]  Hitler he'll be able to tread water and then he's got to be burned at the stake
[42:40.280 --> 42:44.040]  I'm being sarcastic folks they'll know I'm being sarcastic but they'll probably
[42:44.040 --> 42:46.360]  have Rachel Matt I'll come out and say that I want to kill my dog or something
[42:46.360 --> 42:50.200]  that that's what they do even when I say it satire now this is not satire
[42:50.200 --> 42:55.560]  city of Seattle tells employees they'll be fired if they use the word brown
[42:55.560 --> 43:00.200]  bag it some people say oh I'm not you know I don't all the time the last week I
[43:00.200 --> 43:03.440]  asked Kurt I said hey I'm gonna buy the rider's lunch you guys have done a great
[43:03.440 --> 43:07.800]  job he goes oh man my wife made me some great stuff I'm brown bagging it yeah
[43:07.800 --> 43:14.360]  some great ribs left over from last night and although that's racist too you
[43:14.360 --> 43:18.120]  know like people like ribs by the way whenever I talk about Obama and being
[43:18.120 --> 43:21.520]  Jim Jones his followers want to drink the Kool-Aid they say oh black people
[43:21.520 --> 43:24.000]  drink Kool-Aid really I thought everybody drank Kool-Aid see everything you
[43:24.000 --> 43:28.560]  can't talk you know if a high school wants to have a joke day making fun of
[43:28.560 --> 43:31.760]  country people that's what it's really about is making fun of rednecks that
[43:31.760 --> 43:35.360]  that's what the day was the feds found out in Arizona and are moving to sue
[43:35.360 --> 43:41.040]  everybody and ban it saying you you girls can't can't you know wear Daisy
[43:41.040 --> 43:45.200]  Duke pants and and put fake teeth in which really it's making fun of people
[43:45.200 --> 43:48.800]  from the country that's really what that's all the only acceptable thing is
[43:48.800 --> 43:56.120]  to be anti-rural white so in a way it really is a prejudice and and it's kind
[43:56.120 --> 43:58.520]  of fun too though because I'm kind of a redneck so I could make fun of them
[43:58.520 --> 44:03.080]  allowed to but the point is is that is that it's clearly a very popular thing
[44:03.080 --> 44:07.360]  it's like dressing up like a caveman well thank God for the caveman but the
[44:07.360 --> 44:13.520]  point is is that that's what this is all that's what this is all about and so
[44:13.520 --> 44:16.400]  it's about getting you obsessed with everything that's not real so that you
[44:16.400 --> 44:21.720]  ignore all the real foreign banks stealing 85 billion a month the taxpayer
[44:21.720 --> 44:25.000]  money general motors being shipped overseas our power plants being shot
[44:25.000 --> 44:28.120]  down that's the globalist discriminating against us all but see as long as they
[44:28.120 --> 44:32.080]  can divide and conquer us everything's okay so but it's worse you can't say
[44:32.080 --> 44:35.600]  the word citizen because you're not allowed to that might hurt people that
[44:35.600 --> 44:40.840]  aren't citizens just like in San Francisco and Texas or was it in Dallas too
[44:40.840 --> 44:45.480]  it happened a few years ago you're not allowed it was Hispanic students at one
[44:45.480 --> 44:48.960]  school wearing one of them it started when he worn American flag shirt just
[44:48.960 --> 44:53.960]  an American apparel American flags and they said you can't wear that and then
[44:53.960 --> 44:58.000]  and then the illegals all wore their Mexican flag shirts and then the school
[44:58.000 --> 45:02.920]  suspended six Hispanic youth American citizens in San Francisco because they
[45:02.920 --> 45:06.960]  said the American flag is hurtful so see you don't say citizen you don't have the
[45:06.960 --> 45:11.560]  American flag and you don't have teapots because that's Hitler and my dogs
[45:11.560 --> 45:15.200]  Hitler and you don't say the word homosexual and you can't have a rebel
[45:15.200 --> 45:19.240]  flag and you can't you know even have an orange General Lee car because that means
[45:19.240 --> 45:23.120]  you're racist and just on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on but
[45:23.120 --> 45:27.000]  if banks want to rape you and take your pension funds that's okay so so without
[45:27.000 --> 45:31.280]  further ado here is the local Seattle TV station ladies and gentlemen where you
[45:31.280 --> 45:35.200]  do not say citizen or the words brown bagging it I didn't know that see now
[45:35.200 --> 45:38.720]  I'm aware of this when Kurt when I said hey Kurt I walked in I said I'm gonna buy
[45:38.720 --> 45:41.560]  the riders lunch he said well you can get them lunch they do that you know
[45:41.560 --> 45:44.480]  every once a week for some department like to get people lunch that's what I
[45:44.480 --> 45:51.440]  do Texas hospitality which is racism as well and I mean again I was at Martin
[45:51.440 --> 45:55.680]  Springs a few months ago and and it was two Hispanic guys and and and and a white
[45:55.680 --> 45:59.680]  guy and one of the Hispanic guys goes let's go eat at that such Chinese food
[45:59.680 --> 46:04.320]  place hey let's go you I can tell they were stoned they're all having fun
[46:04.320 --> 46:10.000]  pool hell's good that Chinese up in such such and the the one white guy in the
[46:10.000 --> 46:15.480]  Hispanic politically correct they go don't say Chinese they were just saying
[46:15.480 --> 46:19.360]  Chinese I guess I say I was getting Mexican food oh it's racist I mean you
[46:19.360 --> 46:23.200]  know you know let's get I guess they had like an Irish pub let's get Irish food
[46:23.200 --> 46:27.440]  oh you're against you're against oh my gosh oh you made a Mick Wiener joke oh
[46:27.440 --> 46:33.720]  oh my oh see but oh we're putting BPA and all on all the kids juice boxes the
[46:33.720 --> 46:37.200]  brain damages them and gives them cancer and they're raping their brains well
[46:37.200 --> 46:43.960]  that's okay let's go ahead and go to now the solidization of America in Seattle
[46:43.960 --> 46:47.840]  here it is brown bag folks is racist here it is
[46:51.840 --> 46:56.160]  that is part of the memo to city hall that spells it all out a recommendation
[46:56.160 --> 47:00.520]  to no longer use the terms citizen or brown bag that's right the office for
[47:00.520 --> 47:03.720]  civil rights says Seattle serves all residents whether they're citizens or
[47:03.720 --> 47:08.400]  not some like it and some don't I think it's ridiculous in the sense that
[47:08.400 --> 47:13.400]  citizenship means like legal matters it might not account for everybody and
[47:13.400 --> 47:16.760]  while city leaders publicize brown bag lunch meetings all the time the term
[47:16.760 --> 47:22.480]  does have assorted history it used to be a way that people could judge the skin
[47:22.480 --> 47:28.040]  color but do you find it offensive no I personally don't they've been calling
[47:28.040 --> 47:32.360]  that brown bags for years and those responses made us think what else might
[47:32.360 --> 47:36.480]  governments try to ban brown bags come from the supermarket near the black
[47:36.480 --> 47:43.320]  olives the white onions and the yellow mustard
[47:43.320 --> 47:48.680]  we all want a white Christmas and a lot of us tie yellow ribbons around that old
[47:48.680 --> 47:52.800]  oak tree that's racist U-dub students spend years walking through Red Square
[47:52.800 --> 47:57.240]  but the city of Seattle is not alone state lawmakers made it to remove all
[47:57.240 --> 48:01.480]  gender-specific words and official records freshmen are now first-years
[48:01.480 --> 48:06.040]  journeymen our journey level and penmanship handwriting come on we all
[48:06.040 --> 48:09.880]  know what it means to offend or not to offend I mean I think that's carrying
[48:09.880 --> 48:13.520]  that to the point of ridiculous the point turns out it's a really big
[48:13.520 --> 48:18.400]  question so what do you say instead of brown bagging it at the office well
[48:18.400 --> 48:23.320]  according to that memo floating around Seattle try out sack lunch or how about
[48:23.320 --> 48:29.760]  lunch and learn Luke Ducey Como for news well wait a minute that's anti German
[48:29.760 --> 48:33.600]  because the Germans sacked Rome and they even call some of the tribes of the
[48:33.600 --> 48:39.720]  nickname the Romans had him with sackers whoa I I'm part German I want that band
[48:39.720 --> 48:45.040]  again and and and the media should have absolutely decried it Como did an okay
[48:45.040 --> 48:49.680]  job usually immediately like this is good arrest everyone but but that's where
[48:49.680 --> 48:53.920]  this is all going ladies and gentlemen that's the plan meanwhile when we come
[48:53.920 --> 48:56.720]  back before I get into all the geopolitical news that I've mentioned
[48:56.720 --> 49:02.360]  the huge Benghazi news and more this went up on info wars calm yesterday

[56:14.600 --> 56:17.840]  save it and even the news didn't say that it's like armed agents raid animal
[56:17.840 --> 56:21.680]  shelter for baby deer and then kill it should be the headline here it is weeks
[56:21.680 --> 56:25.320]  ago racials he was working in the barn at the society of st. Francis on the
[56:25.320 --> 56:30.400]  Kenosha Illinois border when a swarm of squad cars arrived bearing a search warrant
[56:30.400 --> 56:37.960]  nine in our agents for deaf and they were all armed to the teeth the focus of
[56:37.960 --> 56:42.160]  their search a baby fawn brought here by an Illinois family worried she'd been
[56:42.160 --> 56:45.600]  abandoned by her mother when I made a little noise don't like with laughing
[56:45.600 --> 56:49.760]  shows he deals mostly with dogs and cats he videotaped the fawn they named
[56:49.760 --> 56:54.000]  giggles during the two weeks she was here the DNR began investigating after
[56:54.000 --> 56:58.920]  two anonymous calls reporting a baby deer at the no-kill shelter the warden
[56:58.920 --> 57:02.560]  drafted an affidavit for the search warrant complete with aerial photos in
[57:02.560 --> 57:06.680]  which he describes getting himself into a position where he was able to see the
[57:06.680 --> 57:10.960]  fawn going in and out of the barn agents told staff they came to seize the deer
[57:10.960 --> 57:15.120]  because Wisconsin law forbids the possession of wildlife I said the
[57:15.120 --> 57:19.880]  deer is scheduled to go to the wildlife reserve the next day a wildlife
[57:19.880 --> 57:24.520]  reserve in Illinois which allows the rehabilitation of deer shows he says
[57:24.520 --> 57:28.360]  agents corralled workers near the picnic area then set out in search of the
[57:28.360 --> 57:33.280]  fawn I was thinking in my mind well yeah they're gonna get take the deer and
[57:33.280 --> 57:38.320]  take to a wildlife shelter and then here they come carry in the baby deer over
[57:38.320 --> 57:42.960]  their shoulder like a bag she was in a body bag I said why did you do that he
[57:42.960 --> 57:49.160]  said well it's our policy well that's one that's one hell of a policy now

[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:45.760]  last night I was making the joke yesterday that it's torture to listen to
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:50.320]  NPR and then they admit they're trying to hypnotize you and Joseph Farrell from
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:55.280]  Roland Daly was on top of the NSA director talking in that same

[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:02.400]  do you hear that I'm whispering right in your ear
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:07.280]  I'm right in your ear buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:13.680]  please do your part to help oh my goodness unbelievable
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:17.200]  by the way if you just joined us I'm still in the aftershock before I get
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:21.360]  into all the Benghazi news and the rest of it and the 47th chromosome that
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:25.360]  DARPA is going to bequeath to all of us but before I
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:29.520]  get to all of that you know I played a clip out of Wisconsin on the Illinois
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:33.680]  border of a well-known established large animal shelter
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:37.680]  and somebody brought him a baby deer that the mother had been run over
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:42.000]  a fawn and they put a clip of it on youtube how cute it was so they swat
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  teamed them and I see this the more innocent like
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.320]  if you have a garden in your yard there's a regulation
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:51.920]  they'll send a swat team and if you even ask a question they'll taser you now
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:54.400]  I mean it's just it's all part of mental illness these
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:57.120]  little kids dressed up in all these outfits and it says
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:00.560]  you know all these agencies show up and ate swat trucks
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:03.520]  and they hold everybody at gunpoint while they search the place and act like
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:07.040]  it's and they go kill the baby deer and put it in a body bag
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:10.320]  and then give them fines
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:15.360]  and they go it's our policy okay
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:19.200]  while the government literally is involved in every crime under the sun
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:23.920]  there's just these giant bureaucracies of minders
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:27.840]  and I've told the story many times we've got a old family ranch
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:32.000]  in east Texas and when I was a kid maybe you know every couple years the game
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.840]  warden would drive up open in morning say hi to you
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:39.360]  and maybe have a cup of coffee then drive on to the next place or whatever
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.840]  but still it was just you know you shouldn't be looking at them but they
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:44.880]  see on the side of the road killing somebody's deer or something and that's
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:49.840]  an issue but you know it's that first contact now you can be camping
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:53.440]  and they show up in like swat outfits and jump out and run over to you and
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:55.760]  threaten you and and then and then run into your
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:59.200]  cookhouse without a warrant and run around in circles and then
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:02.400]  and then and then you find they're doing it to everybody and it's just the
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:05.840]  country's going to fall okay so the good news is all you government
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:09.200]  toties you're not going to have any futures you just take your shots eat

[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:36.240]  well ladies and gentlemen i have a news report obama is disappearing
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:40.320]  Benghazi survivors and changing their names we're going to be getting to that
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:44.640]  clip coming up here in just a few minutes thank you for joining us
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:48.560]  we're now into the second hour i've told my writers
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:52.320]  not to brag but just to show the the viewers and readers and listeners
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:57.040]  that we don't make stuff up one week after Benghazi
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:04.080]  i had wane madson on and about two weeks after i had a colonel schaefer on
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:07.840]  and just a host of guests in our own analysis
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:13.600]  from people that have been to libya in the case of madson while it was
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:17.440]  happening saying that it was an arms deal gone bad
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:22.000]  and there was basically a stand-down order for more than six hours made
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.680]  so everyone can be killed and colonel schaefer
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:30.800]  basically sounded like he agreed with my statement
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:35.280]  elaborating on what he'd said and then he got a bunch of heat over it
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:39.360]  and so he backed off a bit but i could see he's saying his interpretation was
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:42.880]  that he didn't know obama ordered the hit just that there had been a stand down
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:45.440]  and then they were coming to kill him and we know the people that came to kill
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:50.800]  them were the head of Benghazi security i mean that's that's admitted too so
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:54.400]  you've got all the pieces here and now you read the london telegraph the
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:57.840]  associated press unim today cia running arms smuggling team in
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:02.160]  Benghazi when consulate was attacked uh 35 cia operas are being told to keep
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:05.920]  quiet but it's been leaked to the london telegraph that the television
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:09.040]  network said that a cia team was working in an annex
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:12.720]  we told you that it was a warehouse complex near the consulate on a project
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:15.520]  to supply missiles what have i been telling you for
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:20.480]  since this happened when the window Benghazi happened exactly
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:24.960]  yes so it's not so it's not like a year yet i say like a year whatever it's it
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:29.360]  hadn't been a year yet so seems like a million years
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.840]  it's like time's going fast but it's also going slow we've been talking about
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:38.160]  Benghazi so long so i've been telling you for nine months or ten months
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:44.160]  that this was going on and now it's all over fox news as we speak
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:49.520]  it's all over everywhere so how many times have you heard this here
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:53.040]  and heard this first and heard this over and over
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:57.600]  and over and over and over and over and over
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:01.120]  and over and over again you've heard this
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:04.240]  that they were supplying missiles from libian armories
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:10.000]  to syrian rebels and wanted it covered up
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:15.280]  and they sent the security force look look here's what we know
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:18.160]  they ordered to stand down for more than six hours they lied and said there was
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:20.240]  no surveillance that was two predator drones
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:23.040]  anisee 130 they lied and said they couldn't get them help for
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:26.480]  many hours the truth was they had people 30 minutes away
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:30.960]  the truth is they had large contingencies of commandos cia and others
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:34.400]  thousands of u.s personnel in the city of Benghazi
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:38.720]  hundreds of them combat ready and they were ordered to stand down
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:41.360]  the security services knew where everyone was going and were tracking
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:46.240]  their cell phones and even stopped vehicles that were fleeing
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:52.320]  do people forget this and we know that there were missiles there heat
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.720]  seeking missiles and other high-tech weapons in a
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:58.640]  complex behind the safe house we know that the
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:03.600]  one of the top ministers the foreign foreign minister of turkey was there at
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:07.600]  the meeting hours before it happens
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:11.280]  so they're at a safe house by a bunch of warehouses the Turkish ambassador shows
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:17.440]  up he's with the u.s ambassador to Libya ambassador
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:22.720]  chris stevens here comes hundreds of the security service with
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:27.040]  inside knowledge of how the state department cia navy
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:31.040]  seal security is working they attack the facility
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:34.320]  two navy seals from down the road refuse to follow stand-down orders
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:38.880]  run down and attack them from behind so it goes from an hour operation to a six
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:42.000]  plus hour operation giving everybody time in shent
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.360]  com to sit there on the aircraft carriers and at the nato bases on the
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:49.760]  mainland in italy to watch everyone die reportedly they watch more than five
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:52.720]  hours of them dying
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:55.760]  because those drones can loiter for more than 12 hours
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:00.160]  they're just sitting there flying in circles watching it all in high
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:03.120]  def and that's why this is such a scandal because
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:06.880]  there were there were situation rooms at the pentagon situation rooms in nato
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:10.960]  situation rooms everywhere watching this go on for hour
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:18.000]  after hour after hour after hour after hour with just dozens and dozens and
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.880]  dozens i mean some say hundreds of the combatants being killed getting
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:26.240]  matter and matter as they're running trying to kill them
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:29.600]  only six security people inside fighting them off
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:33.280]  and so they get mad and bring in any aircraft guns and point them down at the
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:37.280]  ground and start shooting to kill everybody inside
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:40.400]  and and they were reportedly cursing obama and stuff while they did it because
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:45.200]  they'd been sent in to kill them and then the the it wasn't a piece of cake like
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:48.640]  they thought and that's what happened and just
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:51.440]  like they killed the navy seals that did the fake bin laden raid now their
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:54.560]  families are coming out saying they killed them i told you that
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:57.840]  over a year ago folks directly from navy seal
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:02.800]  active duty whole nine yards knowing since he was in high school
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:05.440]  my dad's known him since he was in high school i've known him since he was in
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:09.520]  college but the whole point is is that i know an navy seal
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:13.600]  his friends with people in shield team six his best friends in still team six
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:16.800]  and they all say there was a bomb on that helicopter and they said this is an
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:20.000]  emission we're not being given a mission just get on the helicopter and don't
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.920]  ask questions they don't give them a good story
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:27.440]  so they all get on the helicopter overloaded fly out to save
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:32.000]  rangers made up story it blows up they crash there's people waiting right where
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.600]  it crashes to shoot them with 50 caliber rifles
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:39.520]  and now all that's been classified the families one another so it's classified
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:44.240]  but the media admits it was all a lie there was no al-qaeda they weren't
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:47.200]  insurgents and they're so like what happened they killed your family
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:51.120]  that's what happened and now the families are telling you
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:54.240]  over a year after i told you when had been gauzy
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:58.080]  happening it happened like 10 months ago when did the seal
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:01.040]  helicopter blow up a few months after the fake bin laden raid because they were
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:04.160]  talking and it's also come out mainstream news that
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:07.360]  no one saw bin laden thrown in the water there was no ceremony
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:11.680]  and they've court-martialed like 36 last time i checked of people that were
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:14.400]  speaking up it's it's like a record number of court
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:17.920]  marshals on a ship kicking them out because they were all talking i mean
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:23.440]  ladies and gentlemen this whole deal is cut and dry
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:28.400]  so do we know obama ordered it to be a hit we know their security forces
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:31.760]  run by the cia go over and attack a facility
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:34.800]  and a mile away are a bunch of cia navy seals
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:38.560]  delta force types by the hundreds and none of them are allowed to go over and
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:42.240]  defend them they stand down while watching everybody get killed
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:46.720]  and now the pentagon gets it they're going to wait we kill navy seals we kill
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:50.640]  cia commandos we kill them we kill the ambassador
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:54.240]  just to cover something up so al-qaeda can be given missiles
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:58.960]  none of us are safe boy you just won the big prize
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:02.320]  you put two and two together i mean there there is no
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:08.080]  debate that elements of the federal government ordered them to be killed
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:13.600]  in order to stand down do we know exactly who gave the order i i don't know
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:18.160]  but obama has been lying about it from the start so i told you the seal families
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.880]  and the seals know they killed those seals that's now
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:24.320]  fox news michael sabbage finally pushed it out and got it broke
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:28.000]  we've been talking to the families but i talked to seals and their families
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.240]  they were scared they said look we'll all be killed if we talk
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:35.280]  they've told the seals we're not just going to kill you we're going to kill
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:40.240]  your family do you understand that and by the way i've had the former joint
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:44.880]  chiefs of staff chairman on and other admirals
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:49.200]  all saying they were there when lbj said i want that ship going to the bottom
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:52.640]  on the uss liberty and then i've interviewed the the the
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:57.040]  officers of the uss liberty though it's on record it's archived
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:00.800]  there's over 30 plus of the interviews are more probably 50 i don't know
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:04.000]  where they were on that ship and they were told well you survived you're
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.560]  getting the congressional medal of honor but if you ever talk
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:10.160]  you won't just be court marshals you're going to be killed this is the highest
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:14.080]  national security and they've called the navy seals in and said
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:19.680]  there's a lot of talk you talk about this you're dead
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:22.720]  and your families are dead well the families are speaking out they're like
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:25.280]  go ahead and kill us then we're going to speak out
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:28.000]  and they may start killing their families i mean you know
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.360]  they'll have many vans full of you know navy seals families and blow them up
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:34.320]  maybe maybe they can burn them at the stake publicly and liberals are all
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:36.480]  get around dance around in circles around it
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:40.640]  i mean i don't know man that's how dishonorable this is
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:44.240]  that's how sick this is that's how out of control
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:50.160]  all of this is and it's only going to get worse and worse and worse because
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:57.120]  we interviewed a hitler youth a few years ago
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:01.760]  and uh we're going to put it in the film he died last year but here after we
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:06.240]  interviewed him and he said it was the godlessness
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:10.560]  germany became godless and said oh there is no god and as soon as they said
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:13.840]  that and there was no standards well why not do everything
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:18.000]  why not and and you learn in business and life a lot of the public's really
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.200]  screwed up now more and more it's spreading everywhere businesses
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:24.000]  talk about this especially in the western decadent world
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.240]  and there's offshoring for a lot of reasons but one of the big ones is
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:33.040]  the average westerner has become so lazy and so mentally ill and so weird
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:36.800]  that they could have a chance to make a hundred thousand dollars
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:40.640]  by doing a little bit of hard work they'd rather imagine
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:44.160]  they're going to cheat you and do great even though it destroys them
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:47.680]  and everybody's marveling at this you're seeing it because they're godless and
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:51.440]  and we and i've learned that people that say they're an atheist
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:55.520]  people that say they're proud on average and that laugh at you because you
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:00.800]  believe in god they are the people that
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:04.720]  are are just scum i mean i i i that there is no
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:08.640]  way to describe it they have no pillars they have no mooring
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:12.400]  they have they aren't they aren't human
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:15.520]  they think you're dumb and they think they know everything and it's like a
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:19.440]  disease of like morons and i know there's some
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:22.960]  atheists who might be nice people out there and folks who are agnostics say
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.920]  hey i don't know and i don't like organized religion well i certainly
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:29.440]  don't like it either but i just keep noticing that the
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:32.640]  people that are and you know like talking to von campy
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:36.320]  the hitler youth he said it was it was it was the atheists
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:39.040]  that it was that it was and he said they weren't really atheists they were
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:42.000]  devils and that's really what it is they just
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.120]  people say well why are they doing this because they like to do it
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:51.280]  the journey is the destination and so i told you so it was about missiles
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:55.600]  in the warehouse from our sources and a year plus later we're confirmed

[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:52.240]  that men in uniforms can touch them because that's their religion and they

[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:07.200]  pentagon has awarded contracts to al-qaeda in afghanistan steve watson he
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:12.080]  links her to a bloomberg article what did cars i say a few months ago he said
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:15.680]  the west runs al-qaeda and they're trying to kill me and they want to keep a
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:19.040]  war going so they can control the opium i don't just
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:22.800]  believe cars i happen to know that's true
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:26.560]  but if you tell a cop you don't want to search your car to look for heroin
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:31.040]  they'll break your jaw there's a lawsuit out in california where
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:33.920]  ukrainian legal immigrant was driving a truck that didn't
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:38.160]  understand the officer when he was saying shine the digital ticket so uh
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:41.200]  they drug him out and bash his head in the ground and almost killed him
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:45.040]  and i think that's fine i think the man should have been executed
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:49.600]  and the police officer should have bathed in his blood as a sacrament to god government
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:52.640]  truck driver nearly beaten to death there's the headline of course i'm being
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:56.240]  sarcastic about how the government's god but you're going to find out it's god
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:59.760]  folks let's let's let's move right along now

[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:35.360]  al-qaeda linked lawmakers says and you know i i i would guess this is just
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:38.480]  going to be a new political distraction from ben gauzy and they probably want
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:41.840]  to kill a few people uh that are at embassies they haven't been able to kill
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:45.840]  yet that are witnesses so al-qaeda will take care of that they always take care

[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:36.960]  our next guest here but let me just show you a little stack of these bad boys
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:40.560]  right now uh here's one dar put the genetically
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:43.840]  engineered humans by adding a 47 chromosome
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:48.000]  time magazine reports and the truth is they're already messing with our dna and
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.600]  admit that with the gmo foods and and out of the mutations they
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:54.960]  that they're they'll kill most of us they want to find out
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:58.880]  how they get the the uber mention or the superman
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:03.120]  uh out of that uh and uh continuing here fbi

[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:13.200]  okay and then here's seeing it in uh your tv might be watching you and it goes
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:16.880]  on to say with cameras microphones and definitely with the digital info it's
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:20.720]  compiling everything about you and selling the data
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:26.000]  i told you that 15 years ago i don't know 1997's when i met with the first time
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.760]  warner engineer by the way never heard from him again
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:34.400]  after that happened i just got death threats uh and i told you all about it
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:38.000]  then i guess breaking news and being right
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.240]  i'm sorry i'm sorry oh it's in fox news that vpa is giving people cancer
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:46.160]  sterilizing them and making people gay but instead of getting an apology from
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:49.840]  everybody i'll be attacked more
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:53.680]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:30:00.400]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:04.320]  are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:07.760]  as we've moved through history every great leader has had to understand
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:13.280]  the potential of information billions of dollars have been spent privately and
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:19.040]  publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche from compulsory state
[01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:22.640]  education to the hollywood media brainwashing machine
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:26.880]  we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:30.880]  when somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:34.000]  out and verifying it they can take total control of your awareness
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.040]  all of this is happening so fast you need to be ahead of the game
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:40.560]  how to engineer the opinion of the american people
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:44.480]  so that they would not only endorse but demand a war

[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:21.840]  alex jones my friends everybody in their gut knows that everybody can see it
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:26.480]  intellectually even the most dull out there know that we're going
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:32.720]  into a metastasizing multifaceted multivariate
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:39.680]  interwoven interlocked bloom of corruption and control freaks playing
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:42.960]  god and wanting to run our lives because they crave it
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:46.320]  and good people never want to run people's lives they're they're confident
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:51.200]  they're happy they have lots of friends they have lots of hobbies and ideas and
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:55.280]  life is fulfilling and so we don't seek to dominate others
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:59.680]  we enjoy being honorable we enjoy being constructive
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:04.720]  we enjoy standing up though for ourselves when it is an immediate threat
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:09.920]  but if it's incremental and if it's sold like it's a societal move
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:16.320]  we tend to comply now resistance and non-compliance is not patriotic
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:20.400]  it's not just common sense it is survival
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:24.320]  it is unequivocal it is default
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:27.760]  and the answer to bring down the technocrats is for there to be a great
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:30.640]  awakening we're very close to that and that's why they're attempting to just
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:34.160]  mainline all the bad things they're doing and attempt to just overwhelm us
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:37.200]  instead of denying it while they built the control grid now they're like
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:40.400]  okay you're resisting it but it's just everywhere and
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:43.120]  yeah we were doing everything what's she gonna do about it to make you feel
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:47.040]  overpowered to make you feel small but it's time to stop complying it's time
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:51.280]  to start getting aggressive it's time in nonviolent civil disobedience at
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:54.160]  every level and they phrase civil disobedience
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:58.320]  being a legal lawful protest that that's not what civil disobedience is
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:03.040]  civil disobedience is loading your shotgun in dc to exercise a right that's
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:06.960]  inherent and i'm not recommending you should do something that
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:11.920]  that honorable and and encourage filled but it's now time to start getting
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:15.360]  aggressive and film is the language now
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:19.760]  television is the language not so much print that's for more thinkers who then
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:24.160]  can influence others it's important to put it down in text but film
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:27.840]  and video is now the way to really communicate
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:31.040]  and that's why we had the paul revere contest a hundred and fifteen thousand
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:35.600]  dollars that quite frankly i didn't have i took my own personal nest egg savings
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:40.080]  it's not very large and and putting an end to this because
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:43.120]  it's all pure research i don't even know what would come from this millions of
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:46.560]  millions of views already over six hundred films several hundred of them
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:49.680]  really good more than fifty or so that are excellent
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:53.920]  a few seven or eight that are just amazing
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:57.600]  it was about okay they've spent tens of billions every year
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:00.800]  for propaganda and disinfo and new world order garbage
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:04.400]  what would a hundred and fifteen thousand dollars do because i don't want
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:08.400]  at the end of this you know just i got a nice house and a nice car and a hot tub
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:10.480]  and boy that's great that doesn't fulfill me
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:13.840]  that doesn't float my boat that doesn't give me a thrill
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:16.640]  you know they get a thrill up their leg you're there at msnbc when they see the
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:20.640]  president uh well i guess uh slime ball
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:23.840]  matthews gets some kind of homoerotic excitement well that's his own issue
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:27.360]  i'm all into freedom great good for you the point is i don't get a thrill up my
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:29.680]  leg uh when i look at brock obama i get a
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:33.600]  chill up my spine of of concern and in my instincts but also
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:37.360]  intellectually knowing danger danger warn people
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:40.640]  so we've had the contest it's been a big success we're going to continue to
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:43.760]  showcase some of the films some of the music videos some of the comedies that
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:47.120]  didn't get a lot of attention on the nightly news on the radio show
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:51.200]  on prison planet dot com on info wars dot com
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:54.480]  and we all know that the time is short the enemy's moving quickly because the
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:58.400]  enemy knows the time is short and so now is the time to be all in
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:01.360]  most people have been super good sports if they didn't win first second or
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:04.000]  third place some people i saw took their videos down that's your
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:09.360]  loss for society humanity uh so some people can't stand losing
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:13.360]  you you only lose by being a bad sport you win by being involved
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:16.320]  in the great game of life on the side of good
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:20.080]  it's the animating contest of liberty that's empowering but you can see all
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:24.400]  of the different entries at info wars dot com forward slash paul
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:28.960]  or just type in paul revere film contest into the search engine into the nsa
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:32.160]  terminal that's what your computer is is an nsa terminal it's not like the nsa
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:34.880]  spying on you you're in an nsa built terminal
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:39.600]  tarpa terminal that's just the whole thing is i'm sorry i mean that's to be
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:43.200]  tarpa and mit said that 30 years ago it's just so frustrating to
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:46.880]  read their own writings people are like is alex right they're spying on me
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:50.640]  is he or is the bpa meant to sterilize us is it me
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:56.000]  yeah it's all on record and that's what's so frustrating folks you can you
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.560]  you can differ on my final analysis or my solutions but
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:04.480]  i don't have an intellect or words to describe to you the massive constellation
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:08.960]  of control freak craziness that's coming down on us
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:12.640]  because it's at its heart darpa has announced that they're
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:16.000]  they're going to create humans with a 47th chromosome
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.560]  and they're going to make it the law your baby's got to be screened international
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:21.440]  health care to kill the embryo if they say it has a problem
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:26.000]  like mental illness like opposition to corruption as a mental illness
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  this is the brave new world huxley said that was the plan
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.840]  and so i'm all in against this because let me tell you these people running this
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:37.760]  are a bunch of sickos it'd be bad enough if they were like
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:42.240]  you know an alien race or something that had some other plan for us
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:46.720]  i wouldn't want our destiny taken control these are the most degenerate
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:55.600]  wanting weirdo selfish crazed just vicious people running things
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:58.560]  and we've got to get control of the wheel of the ship here
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:02.720]  and put it back on this course of the north star of common sense and
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:07.920]  and and and common law and organic
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:12.640]  systems not what is being built and then the globalists are handing
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:15.680]  they don't know how to interface all these ai computers to track everybody
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:19.360]  so it's already automated it's already autonomous on record
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:23.760]  the big google defense brain the big b system in belgium
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:26.320]  they call it that by the way not the bible thumpers
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:30.720]  uh... the uh... the they're already the mall almost all the new drones are
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:33.600]  autonomous i mean these people have a death wish
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:38.480]  and i don't have one and so the winner is
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:42.800]  michael dormant and he's a very interesting uh... individual
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:46.880]  i'm not going to go over uh... his uh... entire
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:50.560]  background right about him and i am db dot com
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:53.920]  the department of homeland security has been infiltrated at top levels by foreign
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:57.360]  globalists who are preparing to implode the global economy to consolidate the
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:00.960]  world's assets for themselves they know the u.s military veterans christians
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:03.440]  and gun owners and pro-constitutionists will not allow
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:06.160]  america to fall out of fight so a purge of these
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:10.480]  citizens that's by the way of public this purge plan is public they should all
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:14.640]  be arrested has been ordered and is underway the dhs has
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:18.080]  begun to conduct psychological evaluations throughout the agency
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:21.600]  determine who will be loyal to the purge agenda
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:25.200]  and to discharge those who will not and it's written by
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:29.520]  anonymous uh... and uh... michael dormant uh... joins us he's an actor and
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:31.680]  filmmaker and he's been in a bunch of movies
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:34.560]  he's also produced pg westerns that are very popular
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:38.160]  so he's an established grassroots guy and it's people
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:41.520]  like michael and then those of us out there
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:45.920]  buying from alternative media films visiting alternative media sites voting
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:48.960]  with your dollars before they convert to a total crony
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:53.440]  insider economy that are going to save save our civilization
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:57.840]  but you've got to fight in the info or you've got to become the leader
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:01.200]  whether it's a newsletter handing out my magazine or spreading the word about
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:04.640]  the show or doing your own youtube channel or making films
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:09.280]  whatever your skill is you better use it now and just engage the enemy
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:12.640]  from so many different angles we defeated and people inside the system
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:15.600]  better understand none of you are coming back from this
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:20.080]  this is a this is a hundred-plus year eugenics plan
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:24.000]  that makes me a christian makes me know that they're spiritual forces
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.840]  because there's no way they came up with this a hundred years ago on their own
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:30.560]  i mean this whole thing's been planned they discovered dna to trap you they
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:34.720]  invented computers to racetrack uh... the ibm systems i don't want to get
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:39.680]  off into a rant the point here is is folks we're facing a devilish plan
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:43.360]  and your churches have been taken over i mean it's it's it's it's just
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:48.400]  unbelievable how bad this is and the good news is we're here to wake people up
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:51.840]  so they're aware of this even though this plan is pretty much going to
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:55.440]  play itself out it is going to collapse in the end folks
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:59.520]  common sense shows that my bible says that my gut tells me that
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:04.400]  but it is going to be front row seats to
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:07.680]  the science fiction movie like nothing you've ever seen but you're going to be
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:12.160]  in it in the arena and so the language of awakening is film
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:15.040]  and we're going to go to him briefly here in a moment and he's we're sending
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:17.040]  the hundred thousand dollars the next few days
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:20.880]  and i congratulate him on what he's doing but let's play a clip from purge
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:26.800]  from purge here it is
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:30.640]  we're going to continue to purchase ammunition to keep it off the open market
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:34.080]  this prevents these extremists from getting ammunition in their hands
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:37.520]  additionally we've purchased seven thousand assault weapons
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:42.240]  these weapons will be issued to newly formed fema youth corps brigades
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:45.120]  it's apparent that the world has entered into a currency crisis
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:49.760]  and trade disputes that could actually lead to civil unrest and armed conflict
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:54.080]  now in the past extremists were easy to identify they were skinheads kkk
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:57.680]  members radical political ideologists well now it's become a little more
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:00.640]  difficult this group includes anti-abortionists
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:04.880]  pro-constitutionalists believers in biblical end times
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:08.640]  gun owners and most importantly military veterans
[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:12.400]  excuse me but uh... military veterans are not extremists
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:16.880]  in believers in the end times that's like every christian in america
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:22.240]  that's millions and millions of people and they're good people
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:26.560]  stride and zed in all right now that's uh... michael dormant's film the purge
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:29.440]  i wanted to get him on briefly we was on the nightly news last night to break it
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:33.440]  down we appreciate his work to tell us about his idea for the film
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:36.480]  some of the great people that are in it i want to talk about some of them great
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:40.240]  actors and the fact that really about ninety five percent of this film
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:44.240]  is what they're actually doing i know i i'm guessing you use germans
[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:47.600]  for the dumb down public to get all their foreigners when it's a corporate
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:52.480]  globalist foreign takeover uh... but it's great to have you on sir
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:56.880]  well thank you alex i really appreciate it this was so much fun it was a mission
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:43:59.680]  it was a real mission that's what makes it special
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:03.440]  absolutely well i mean tell us about how you made it and uh...
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:06.800]  a little bit about the crew and uh... where you think this country's going in
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:10.160]  general what you think of what i just said about people like you
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:14.400]  out there all of us uh... it's time for all of us
[01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:17.440]  to resist and just overwhelm in human wave attacks
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:22.080]  in the info war absolutely i imagine i just gathered a lot of your articles
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:26.960]  and so many of your articles in january february were about the dhs their
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:31.280]  paper targets uh... all the ammo buying all the uh... weapons that they were
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:35.840]  hoarding and and gathering up and so i just really put a script together
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:39.440]  uh... a lot of those different articles got creative got great guys like mike
[01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:42.160]  wilford michelle bauer that you saw in the film
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:45.280]  uh... mike wilford he played the uh... evaluator
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:49.280]  well he was a marine he was stationed in germany he knew german
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:52.640]  and that's one reason we we use the language and i personally like the
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:56.080]  german language i think it sounds cool to make that uh... globalist effects and
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:59.440]  that's what i think it's a powerful scary sounding language now i'm about
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:02.000]  half german i get it yeah go ahead
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:06.480]  yeah well we we put that together and uh...
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:10.880]  yeah it it's really all about getting into the globalist mindset and we
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:13.120]  really want to show that in the narrative
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:16.400]  and that's what i really like to do in future projects is is get into their
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:18.880]  mindset and then we get to see it because you're not going to be able to see
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:22.080]  that in an interview you're not going to be able to see that any other way but
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:26.240]  really narrative film and so it just turned into a great
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:28.880]  ministry great mission and off we went
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:32.560]  um... what were the other questions uh... don't just tell us how long you
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:35.680]  shot it about some of the other actors uh... i love all of it and i get you a
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:38.080]  short script the one part and of course i couldn't make
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:40.160]  something that's good probably myself so i'm critiquing
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:43.760]  you know just just hindsight when they see you he says robots people don't get
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:47.680]  it is robots they're moving towards you like autonomous drones systems that
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:50.560]  will follow orders humans are being taken out of the equation
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:53.280]  that's probably the dialogue i would have written but then folks probably
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:58.800]  wouldn't know what that meant so why did you go with the term robots
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:02.160]  well um... just because the article that you posted
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:05.280]  uh... rise of the robots right right there were
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:09.120]  there at the time now originally i wasn't supposed to do that role in the
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:12.240]  movie i was actually subbing for someone so a lot of things
[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:16.000]  that i said during that role i was just kind of winging it
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.640]  so that a lot of that film was is was really uh... we shot that thing i mean i'm
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:23.600]  not even criticizing and i'm just saying that's the one thing people
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:26.960]  they just don't get it is twenty thirteen they are moving to robots
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:30.400]  whether it's an autonomous drone or your smart meter or your iphone that's a
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:34.960]  pre-programmed robot tracking and watching you
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:39.200]  it's so key that they're converting from humans and control the machines
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:41.840]  to the machines because it gives the globalist control
[01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:47.440]  uh... where'd you shoot this this was all shot in tucson arizona
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:50.880]  and uh... that's where i'm from and so i know the city real well and that's where
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:53.760]  i got all my actors my great actors michelle bauer
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:58.400]  uh... mike wilford bob king uh... tom growl all these guys came together
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:02.880]  and uh... we shot it within a week uh... that was shot in april so really we
[01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:05.440]  did that whole thing within the month of april
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:09.280]  well i know it's a big commitment to do something like that and uh... are they
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:14.880]  excited that they won thrilled everyone is just super proud my
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:18.240]  phone has just been just going ballistic and

[01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:40.240]  oh no don't thank me sir there's nothing more beautiful than

[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:46.880]  people know it's serious and then just seeing all this incredible
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:50.480]  pro-human pro-liberty pro-truth art i mean this has got to be
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:55.200]  absolute uh... nails on a chalkboard to the globalist
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:59.200]  yes yes and that that's really where it gets meaningful and and we want to take
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:03.440]  it to another level well i'm excited uh... tell us about some of your other

[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:35.520]  a little mild violence but uh... it has a great great message and so i'd

[01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:29.280]  and then develop a system to put them in theaters i know how to do it but that
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:32.400]  costs millions to even do you know moderate rollout that would really

[01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:10.560]  figuring out it is really bad days it's you know
[01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:14.800]  i was going to plug some sponsors here but i had a dream last night
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:21.920]  i woke up at about four a.m so happy so happy and then i realized it was just
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:25.280]  a dream and then i went and looked at my
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:28.240]  children in bed asleep thought about how someday their
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:32.640]  lives would have just been a dream to have children is to kill your children
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:34.640]  i mean they're going to live and they're going to die but they're going to live
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:37.600]  on through their children it is only the death
[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:41.200]  of humanity and your genetic line that is true death
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:43.920]  and the globalists are doing that with all the genetic engineering and the rest
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:47.200]  of it and it's abominable and the fruit is horrible
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:51.600]  it's just terrible but i just realized that bringing children into the world
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:54.960]  is bringing them into the pain the suffering and i know everybody understands
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:57.280]  this but it's the animating contest of life
[01:55:57.280 --> 01:56:02.240]  so that gift is a thousand times better than any of the bad things that go along
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:05.360]  with it the good outweighs the bad and that
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:09.280]  is the great adventure of life but i had a dog max that we got when i was about
[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:13.040]  seven years old and he died about three months
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:18.480]  after i moved out of my parents house uh he had like a heart attack and i came
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:21.600]  home the vet said he was going to die so i laid down the carpet with him with a
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:24.720]  cover and woke up the morning and he was he was dead
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:30.160]  and uh i woke up from the dream hugging him he was alive again
[01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:33.840]  and oh max i haven't seen you in so long it's so good
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:37.040]  and then i woke up in the middle of the night and i was like oh he's dead
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:41.600]  he's been dead for 20 years and then i just realized you know we're all going
[01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:44.640]  to be dead someday folks we need to really do the right thing now where we're
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:47.600]  alive this is such a wondrous time to be alive
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:50.960]  there's so many good things it's such an adventure
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:54.160]  and you look at the culture of the globalist push
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:58.720]  that lets you know who they are i mean it's just anti good anti wholesome

[02:08:58.160 --> 02:09:01.600]  i wanted to get james dillingpole on last week when i saw his article
[02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:05.520]  he's an english columnist bestselling author novelist who writes
[02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:09.040]  for among other publications the times the daily telegraph and the spectator
[02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:12.720]  he's published many books and novels and political books as well
[02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:15.280]  he describes himself as being a libertarian conservative
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:19.840]  james is the winner of the 2010 bestot prize for online journalism james
[02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:24.400]  dillingpole.com and i always read his stuff in the
[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:28.320]  london telegraph and the reason i wanted to get him on is i saw this
[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:31.760]  headline 97 of climate activists in the pay of big
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:35.920]  oil shock another one hallowbird bleat hallowburton bleats guilty
[02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:39.760]  to destroying evidence after gulf spill that's just some of what we're going to
[02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:44.640]  be going over with him today but it's been four years since
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:49.280]  the kopenhagen event when we got the emails of them all
[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:52.800]  basically meeting with the u.n. and universities to to fix things and hide
[02:09:52.800 --> 02:09:56.960]  the decline in temperature and since then just more and more
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:10:01.520]  has come out where pachari is shutting down steel plants and coal
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:05.120]  plants in england and then getting money to move them to india or
[02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:08.240]  obama pays 21 billion a taxpayer money to ship general motors
[02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:12.240]  to china i mean they're not just shutting this down they're having us
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:17.040]  pay to be shut down to collectivize this and now they've got 101 million americans
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:20.800]  on some form of food assistance uh people are waking up to a certain
[02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:24.320]  extent but does it matter if there's no jobs
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:27.760]  and the regulations are written where you go on the government dole
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:31.760]  uh so i want to discuss that with him as well but you know i personally and my
[02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:35.440]  family and my wife you name it gets zero
[02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:39.680]  money from oil natural gas i own no stocks i mean i've got some family that's
[02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:42.320]  got tiny gas wells on part of their property where they get like you know
[02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:45.920]  500 bucks a month or something but it's actually natural gas i find
[02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:49.920]  on average lobbying to shut down coal too because they're in competition with
[02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:53.040]  it uh the coal lobby ought to pay me some money
[02:10:53.040 --> 02:10:56.960]  i tell you what but i i promote coal because it's clean burning now
[02:10:56.960 --> 02:11:00.720]  all that comes out is water and carbon dioxide so they listed carbon dioxide
[02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:04.320]  as toxic and but china has no controls and
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:07.760]  builds three new ones a week well we have more than three shut down a week
[02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:11.680]  and our power prices go up and up and up they shut down three of the austin on
[02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:15.760]  power plants in the last five years and they're shutting the final one down
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:19.600]  and they admit in the paper our power prices have doubled
[02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:25.760]  in five years doubled doubled and i mean you talk about hurting poor people
[02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:30.000]  it's like obama with obama care raising payroll tax i mean this is
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:35.920]  devastating stuff and just watching america be turned off is painful to me
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:40.000]  it's very very very very very painful to see this happening and so i wanted to
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.920]  get james dilling poll on about that because
[02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:46.480]  their only response of the fake environmentalists to ignore all the
[02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:49.840]  serious issues like overfishing open air genetic engineering things i have a
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:52.720]  real problem with when they're not done properly
[02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:56.640]  is you work for big oil and they just say it as a mantra and then every time i
[02:11:56.640 --> 02:12:01.680]  turn around it's bp uh it's dutch roll shell it's xon
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:08.080]  mobile it's texaco it's valero uh it's it's funding it underwriting it
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:10.480]  and i learned they're shutting down coal they're shutting down all their
[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:13.680]  competition they don't want new refineries built they own all the
[02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:17.680]  this has come out in the associated press they really they didn't just hijack it
[02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:21.040]  was like well of course they're trying to fund us to control us no no no they
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:24.720]  made the modern environmental movement and dilling polls done some major
[02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:29.280]  research on this and it just shows what an incredible double cross this is and
[02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:32.960]  how the big oil companies try to use environmental laws to shut down the
[02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:37.840]  smaller wildcats too so it's really amazing james thank
[02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:41.360]  you for coming on with us to talk about this and i want to in general get into
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:43.280]  other things that are happening in the
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:46.880]  collectivization now we try to turn that around and where you think obama's
[02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:49.920]  going but first off let's get into your article 97
[02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:54.080]  percent of climate activists in the pay of big oil and explain how this works
[02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:59.120]  from your research perspective well alex i think we we we take with the
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:02.560]  pinch of salt that figure 97 percent i was
[02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:06.560]  using it to mock this claim which you must have seen
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:09.600]  widely relayed on the internet and constantly
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:14.240]  constantly put out by the warmest that apparently the big oil funds 97 of
[02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:18.080]  people saying it and yeah yeah but we the the environmentalists are always
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:21.440]  telling us that 97 percent of climate scientists
[02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:26.240]  believe in in man-made global warming and when you look at look at the number
[02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:29.840]  of stud scientists who actually believe this stuff it doesn't stack up it's
[02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:32.320]  basically the result of rigged surveys the first one
[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:37.200]  it's a small amount of you and insiders well exactly you look at the figures and
[02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:42.880]  you realize that it's something like about 75 climate scientists said yes i
[02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:46.560]  think that i think that man-made carbon
[02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:49.920]  dioxide is is contributing to climate change well
[02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:53.440]  almost everyone thinks that it means absolutely nothing of course
[02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:57.760]  it's possible that the co2 contributes to climate change but sure i mean i
[02:13:57.760 --> 02:14:00.320]  understand it's tongue and cheek in your article but you actually link to where
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:04.480]  they get most of them are funded by big oil though
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:08.720]  it's certainly true that the oil industry's record
[02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:12.960]  in in the war against environmentalist nonsense
[02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:16.880]  has not been good you you mentioned the the bp
[02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:19.920]  oil spill i mean let's let's let's let's deal with that one now
[02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:24.720]  why did the bp oil spill happened it's because
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:28.640]  in the in the 90s bp decided that it would
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:32.720]  would greenwash its image it would rebrand itself as something called
[02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:37.840]  beyond petroleum and it would it would start pushing for renewables and it
[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:41.520]  would start investing heavily in the solar industry and get away from this
[02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:44.560]  dirty oil which was was killing the planet and it would
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:48.960]  it would be green and caring and nurturing well the fact is that once
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:53.360]  you once you stop uh what once you give up on your core
[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:56.560]  business and start going down this crazy environmentalist
[02:14:56.560 --> 02:15:00.320]  root certain problems arise and one of the things that bp did
[02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:05.200]  was it cut back on its on its core business it cut back on health and
[02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:08.960]  safety over a period of five years it had three
[02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:13.200]  major accidents culminating in the bp oil spill
[02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:16.640]  why did this happen because it was pretending to be a green company it
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:21.040]  should have stuck to its business and acknowledged that it that it was
[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:24.560]  it should stick to what it's good at which is which is drilling for oil
[02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:28.800]  and there are countless examples of this from across the across the energy
[02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:32.320]  sector i mean the article you you you quoted
[02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:35.600]  was about a guy called Dana Nutcatelli
[02:15:35.600 --> 02:15:40.480]  but Dana Nutcatelli Nutcatelli is one of the green movements attack dogs he
[02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:43.280]  writes a column in the Guardian newspaper one of the
[02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:46.960]  greenest newspapers there is always putting out environs
[02:15:46.960 --> 02:15:50.880]  scare stories and no one puts out environs scare stories
[02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:56.560]  more aggressively than Dana Nutcatelli anyway what this guy has been keeping
[02:15:56.560 --> 02:16:00.320]  very very quiet is the fact that he works for
[02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:06.480]  guess what an oil company uh oh a company called Tetra Tech which is
[02:16:06.480 --> 02:16:11.440]  heavily involved in in in mining and oil exploration now
[02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:14.640]  strangely he didn't think to mention this look at Al Gore
[02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:18.880]  and uh and in Occidental and and and all that i mean it's incredible
[02:16:18.880 --> 02:16:24.160]  Al Gore is a huge oilman yeah exactly and and where did where did where did
[02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:30.160]  Al Gore sell his his um his tv company to he sold out to to big oil much to the
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:34.400]  delight of um some of his his green acolytes but there's
[02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:37.360]  another example in the news the other day you remember
[02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:42.000]  Professor Phil Jones the guy at the climatic research unit one of the stars
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:46.000]  of the climate gate email yes you remember you remember him
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:50.000]  well i found this glorious the glorious picture of a professor
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:54.480]  Phil Jones sandwiched between some Saudi oil men
[02:16:54.480 --> 02:16:58.240]  this guy has now landed himself a gig at the
[02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:01.360]  center of excellence for climate change research
[02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:08.160]  department of meteorology king Abdul Adiz Abdul Aziz university jeda
[02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:11.680]  Saudi Arabia well let's stop right there i'm sure that's a new article you did
[02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:15.520]  give us the headline we'll put it in for tv viewers and so for radio listeners
[02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:19.600]  can find it what's the headline well it's um let's have a look it's it's
[02:17:19.600 --> 02:17:24.560]  it's at a site called tall bloke's talk shop professor phil Jones and king
[02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:29.120]  Abdul Aziz university Saudi Arabia so professor phil Jones and uh
[02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:34.080]  Saudi Arabia to type that in guys it'll come up yeah wow yeah yeah it's the
[02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:38.560]  hypocrisy of these people beggars believe that well don't they just get
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:42.240]  involved in this so that the big oil and big groups can choose the winners and
[02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:45.440]  losers because i mean the ap back in 2000 reported
[02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:49.280]  that the top 10 big oil met and said let's actually fun and viral groups to
[02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:52.400]  shut down new refinery construction so only we have
[02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:56.240]  refineries to create an artificial bottleneck i mean that's when i first
[02:17:56.240 --> 02:17:59.520]  learned about this yeah i think it's true of big
[02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:04.080]  corporations generally that big corporations are the enemy of free
[02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:07.520]  markets they are the enemy of small businesses they love
[02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:11.520]  regulation they love big government because they can wear
[02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:15.440]  all the compliance costs that they can navigate it nobody else can
[02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:19.200]  exactly and they can move their move their operations from country to
[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:22.480]  country to circumvent this this is this is the great advantage of being a
[02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:27.120]  multi-national they can get away with stuff that small local businesses cannot
[02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:30.560]  they use regulation as a way of shutting down
[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:34.160]  their competitors so it's in their interest that they've got all these
[02:18:34.160 --> 02:18:39.760]  gun of greenies campaigning campaigning to to for more regulation
[02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:43.120]  they are not our friends they're not the friends of the little man
[02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:47.440]  it is as you rightly say a stitch up between governments and corporations and
[02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:50.240]  we are the people who suffer you mentioned earlier
[02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:56.000]  president obama and and the the rising energy prices in in in the u.s.
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:59.440]  now you remember a few years ago president obama
[02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:03.280]  gave a an infamous speech where he talked about how
[02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:09.520]  energy prices would necessarily skyrocket just look up obama skyrocket and he
[02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:12.160]  said if you start to build a coal plant we will bankrupt you
[02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:17.600]  yeah he wants energy to get more expensive because of this this greeny
[02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:20.960]  mission that the idea that energy is somehow bad
[02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:24.960]  for us that we shouldn't use air con we shouldn't use refrigerators that's
[02:19:24.960 --> 02:19:27.200]  like telling the africans they can't have it
[02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:33.840]  yeah exactly exactly so uh and and also the energy industry
[02:19:33.840 --> 02:19:40.160]  generally you have for example uh gas prom in russia gas prom the biggest
[02:19:40.160 --> 02:19:45.120]  natural gas producer in russia is busy funding the anti fracking
[02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:48.400]  industry because they see it as a rival then you've got exactly stay there
[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:51.600]  let's talk about that absolutely i've learned that
[02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:55.040]  big oil's funding the anti fracking movement and i'm not for some fracking
[02:19:55.040 --> 02:19:59.040]  some people do do it wrong it it is but the point is they're hyping it
[02:19:59.040 --> 02:20:03.200]  to shut down wildcats amino acids are the building blocks of proteins
[02:20:03.200 --> 02:20:06.960]  amino acids have to be delivered to your body in the shape that nature gave them
[02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:09.920]  if they are to be used to create new proteins in your body
[02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:13.920]  just like a brick layer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick wall
[02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:17.520]  so too your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new
[02:20:17.520 --> 02:20:20.480]  proteins given your body an undamaged amino acid
[02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:23.120]  food can make a huge difference in your health
[02:20:23.120 --> 02:20:27.360]  one world way is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other
[02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:31.440]  you see heating bends and twists amino acids and all-way protein powders
[02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:34.640]  we've investigated and most proteins you consume

[02:24:38.080 --> 02:24:42.880]  and of course best-selling author joins us now you were just getting into
[02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:46.560]  something that real libertarians and conservatives and freedom lovers
[02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:50.080]  for me is the number one mission just what i discovered in 18 years it's like
[02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:53.200]  discovering you know the sun comes up in the morning it's just a
[02:24:53.200 --> 02:24:58.640]  a fact that big mega money almost always
[02:24:58.640 --> 02:25:01.680]  teams up with government to shut down its competition and create controlled
[02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:04.880]  markets and if you see billionaires that made their own money
[02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:09.040]  the system will all organize against them and go after them like a pack of
[02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:12.800]  piranhas uh and this is the message we've got to
[02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:16.880]  get to the left who is anti wealth they don't even understand
[02:25:16.880 --> 02:25:22.480]  it's the ultra rich allied with them and this collectivization to make them
[02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:24.880]  dependent because they don't want competition
[02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:28.400]  so please continue with the uh just incredible
[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:32.400]  uh not even hypocrisy but the organized takeover of the economy
[02:25:32.400 --> 02:25:37.040]  uh the smart meters the uh the they're announcing everywhere the 200
[02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:41.360]  square foot coffin apartments where they raise your taxes and energy prices
[02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:45.200]  where you can only live in that i mean this is really feudalism
[02:25:45.200 --> 02:25:48.000]  yeah i think one of the big questions of our time
[02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:54.640]  alex is why aren't capitalists defending capitalism and the answer
[02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:58.960]  unfortunately i think is that a lot of people within capitalism have given up
[02:25:58.960 --> 02:26:03.280]  on free markets they've they they see no future in it they
[02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:07.840]  i think that people are are so despairing of the future of the global
[02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:12.160]  economy that they are like vultures feeding on the rotting
[02:26:12.160 --> 02:26:16.080]  carcass that the remains of our of our global economic system
[02:26:16.080 --> 02:26:20.000]  and they are they are using government regulation to
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:23.600]  pick up what little bits of meat there are of rotting meat there are left
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:27.360]  in other words no one's sticking up for for small businessmen
[02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:31.280]  building up their businesses and and and uh uh
[02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:36.320]  unencumbered by by government regulation now what you have is is the big
[02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:40.560]  companies teaming up with with the barnwood administration
[02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:45.120]  and getting getting what they can while they still can which is why you get
[02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:49.760]  situations like salindra uh what is it half a billion dollars of
[02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:53.520]  of us taxpayers money just urinated up against the
[02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:57.040]  wall to no purpose whatsoever oh and some of the companies they funded
[02:26:57.040 --> 02:27:00.400]  just opened a p o box and never did anything yeah
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:05.440]  absolutely and this is a the inevitable byproduct
[02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:10.640]  of a world which no longer believes in in capitalism
[02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:14.240]  what's left is this disgusting thing called corporatism
[02:27:14.240 --> 02:27:18.240]  these people some of some of the some of the worst the worst apologists for the
[02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:22.480]  environmental movement in my experience are our executives from the oil
[02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:25.360]  companies they do not they really do not care
[02:27:25.360 --> 02:27:29.600]  whether energy prices are being driven up they do not care about people
[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:33.280]  dry dying in fuel poverty they pay lip service to this stuff
[02:27:33.280 --> 02:27:36.640]  but actually all they think about is the bottom line let's talk about these
[02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:38.640]  numbers and lord montan said it would kill a
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:41.680]  billion people if they put the Copenhagen treating and that even raise taxes
[02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:44.960]  more on the third role in the west and it was all a big double cross
[02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:49.360]  but if they had their agenda 21 plan if they were able to roll it all out
[02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:52.800]  it'll make those of us here all poor poor people really poor
[02:27:52.800 --> 02:27:56.800]  middle-class poor uh upper middle class just you know rich i mean it affects
[02:27:56.800 --> 02:28:00.960]  everybody except the insiders what would happen though for people
[02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:04.000]  in the third world they're they're living at subsistence
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:07.280]  isn't this a death sentence of all this goes through
[02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:10.480]  undoubtedly we've seen the most terrible
[02:28:10.480 --> 02:28:16.000]  store stories going on in in in certain countries in Africa for example
[02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:21.120]  where where villages have been cleared and and burned out and people have been
[02:28:21.120 --> 02:28:25.360]  killed in order to to make way for these these carbon
[02:28:25.360 --> 02:28:28.960]  sinks these these supposed tree plantations which is
[02:28:28.960 --> 02:28:33.760]  supposed to offset global warming there was a something I came up on today
[02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:36.480]  do you remember do you remember that that terrible
[02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:40.320]  video that backfired on the internet the split it was called splattergate where
[02:28:40.320 --> 02:28:44.160]  blowing the kids up hey yeah they're gonna murder the kids yeah okay
[02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:48.000]  okay well Franny Armstrong the the impeccably middle-class
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:52.400]  English woman an environmental campaigner who was responsible for that
[02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:56.080]  for that for that movie has written this this this uh
[02:28:56.080 --> 02:29:00.800]  newsletter to all her enviro friends and at the end she says
[02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:05.120]  should we stockpile cyanide you think i'm exaggerating
[02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:08.400]  but a close friend of mine who has four children said
[02:29:08.400 --> 02:29:12.080]  she plans to kill herself and them when it comes to it
[02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:15.680]  these environmentalists are dangerous they are talking nonsense
[02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:19.760]  on the basis of junk science they are trying to scare us rigid
[02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:23.120]  into taking this concerted global action
[02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:26.880]  to watch ultimately we result in the destruction of the capitalist games stay
[02:29:26.880 --> 02:29:30.080]  there we got to come back this is breaking uh for those that don't know
[02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:32.960]  they showed students who wouldn't accept carbon taxes
[02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:37.120]  blown up by their teacher hailed by the uk government
[02:29:37.120 --> 02:29:41.520]  and now the the head of this is saying stockpile cyanide
[02:29:41.520 --> 02:29:46.640]  like joseph gerbils to kill your children that's what joseph gerbils did
[02:29:46.640 --> 02:29:50.080]  i'm telling you folks this is a death cult of loonies
[02:29:50.080 --> 02:29:53.920]  we're on the march the empires on the run

[02:30:00.640 --> 02:30:04.640]  why does the united states spend the largest percentage of gdp in the world
[02:30:04.640 --> 02:30:07.680]  on health care why do we have the highest cancer rates
[02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:11.440]  on the planet the highest rates of diabetes autism
[02:30:11.440 --> 02:30:16.000]  and every other major disease it all comes down to one thing

[02:33:52.640 --> 02:33:56.800]  schoolchildren blown up and murdered as they're shown to children
[02:33:56.800 --> 02:34:00.400]  uh if they didn't accept carbon taxes we have that clip ready
[02:34:00.400 --> 02:34:03.280]  now let's go ahead and play a clip of splattergate
[02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:06.960]  here no pressure at all but it'd be great to get a sense of how many of you
[02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:11.520]  might do this just a rough percentage that's fantastic
[02:34:11.520 --> 02:34:14.320]  and there's not
[02:34:15.040 --> 02:34:18.960]  philip and tracy that's fine that's absolutely fine they don't accept carbon
[02:34:18.960 --> 02:34:22.160]  taxes she hits the button kills them thank you so much for today
[02:34:22.160 --> 02:34:26.000]  and i will see you all tomorrow oh just before you
[02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:29.360]  go i just need to press the power trip
[02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:33.120]  it's a little button here
[02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:39.360]  now everybody please remember to read chapters five and then it shows the
[02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:43.520]  murdering football players and glaciers business people except for philip and tracy
[02:34:43.520 --> 02:34:48.160]  he goes on and on right just want to check on that 10 10 thing yeah who's
[02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:50.880]  going to go along with the environmental carbon taxes and those that say no
[02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:54.160]  they kill them now they've called in the guardian for
[02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:58.000]  environmental fascism they call it that and it's time to have rationing of
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.480]  course for themselves come to socialists in france
[02:35:00.480 --> 02:35:04.960]  over 100 taxes for the general public this last year to bankrupt people
[02:35:04.960 --> 02:35:08.640]  but they're all exempt that's a big scandal but nobody got in trouble
[02:35:08.640 --> 02:35:13.760]  they have the troops they have the guns and a dilling pole just sent me
[02:35:13.760 --> 02:35:18.000]  uh the uh the article that one of his friends sent him from her internal
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:22.480]  kickstarter program uh of uh the lady that was
[02:35:22.480 --> 02:35:28.240]  behind that video and that program with din din uh talking about reportedly
[02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:31.760]  cyanide so i want you to read from that because
[02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:38.080]  dr eric pionka ut broke down crying at the texas academy of sciences he's got
[02:35:38.080 --> 02:35:40.960]  national awards and international awards in europe
[02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:44.720]  um that i think prince philip or has been at one of his events
[02:35:44.720 --> 02:35:49.680]  no it's prince charles and he projected a power point of skulls
[02:35:49.680 --> 02:35:53.280]  a photo actually of the chimera rouge and the fbi even went and talked to him
[02:35:53.280 --> 02:35:56.560]  he's here with the biology department at ut at the time and he said it's sad but
[02:35:56.560 --> 02:36:00.400]  he and his family are ready to die soon the airborne Ebola will be released
[02:36:00.400 --> 02:36:03.920]  and then i had his graduate students send me threatening emails and i would
[02:36:03.920 --> 02:36:07.840]  check their name and find them working at bio weapon labs in white coats you
[02:36:07.840 --> 02:36:12.560]  know graduating a decade ago so i found the exception
[02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:16.080]  is someone in the biology department nowadays that doesn't say kill all humans
[02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:21.520]  or 90 like pionka and that and so we have her in her own little
[02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:27.680]  email uh attributed to her saying uh we need to have cyanide ready on hand for
[02:36:27.680 --> 02:36:31.520]  our children uh please read from it for folks
[02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:36.560]  yeah okay she writes to her her fans she says you probably heard the appalling
[02:36:36.560 --> 02:36:39.040]  news that for the first time in human history the
[02:36:39.040 --> 02:36:43.680]  concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has just passed 400 parts per
[02:36:43.680 --> 02:36:46.960]  million which means that we are heading for an even worse
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:51.440]  scenario than the one we depicted in the age of stupid that was a film she made
[02:36:51.440 --> 02:36:54.640]  you know another in varo scare movie she made earlier on
[02:36:54.640 --> 02:36:59.200]  um and she says so what the hell are we all going to do now
[02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:03.440]  should we pile pressure onto the un in the hope that they defile expectations
[02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:06.800]  and finally make the international agreement needed to slash global
[02:37:06.800 --> 02:37:10.400]  emissions should we start a national strike
[02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:14.240]  bringing the country to a standstill until the government goes on to a war
[02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:17.440]  footing on climate change should we all go into
[02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:21.360]  survivalist mode buying up guns and fortifying our homes
[02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:24.560]  it sounds extreme but it's not a coincidence that people working on
[02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:28.160]  climate change are buying pieces of land far away from centres of
[02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:32.320]  population to move their families and on the order she goes like
[02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:36.400]  this and then she mentions this friend of hers this friend she says
[02:37:36.400 --> 02:37:41.040]  should we stockpile cyanide you think i'm exaggerating but a close friend of mine
[02:37:41.040 --> 02:37:44.240]  who has four children said she plans to kill herself
[02:37:44.240 --> 02:37:48.320]  and them when it comes to it in a gerbil style
[02:37:48.320 --> 02:37:53.520]  isn't it great simply amazing and we're going to show a text document of that
[02:37:53.520 --> 02:37:58.000]  newsletter on screen this is really like a hillbop cult
[02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:01.680]  and and and meanwhile they're not worried about any of the real issues
[02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:05.440]  that are going on because i i'm concerned about nuclear weapons
[02:38:05.440 --> 02:38:08.960]  proliferation some of the gmo stuff's real a real problem
[02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:12.880]  but i mean they're just we've got a tax carbon dioxide but then the obvious
[02:38:12.880 --> 02:38:15.920]  lie even nasa and all the scientists that have done
[02:38:15.920 --> 02:38:20.640]  ice core mud core they all know that carbon dioxide has
[02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:25.200]  we're in a carbon dioxide low range i've seen reports that it's been over a
[02:38:25.200 --> 02:38:28.800]  hundred times higher before uh and and i mean what are they
[02:38:28.800 --> 02:38:30.880]  talking about oh yeah absolutely in the in the
[02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:35.600]  holocene optimum it was the there were many times more there was
[02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:39.360]  significantly more carbon dioxide there is now and guess what happened the
[02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:42.400]  the earth was much greener than it is now
[02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:45.920]  indeed the fact that co2 has been right rising these last last
[02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:49.680]  last few decades uh what's happened is that the planet has got
[02:38:49.680 --> 02:38:53.280]  much much greener it's easier to grow vegetation
[02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:57.600]  with high co2 levels that's why in industrial greenhouses
[02:38:57.600 --> 02:39:02.880]  they pump in in significant quantities of co2 to help the tomatoes grow and so
[02:39:02.880 --> 02:39:06.240]  on co2 is our friends co2 is plant food
[02:39:06.240 --> 02:39:10.400]  well any any serious scientist knows this by the way can i
[02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:14.400]  credit my excellent friend philian mccalier director of a fantastic film
[02:39:14.400 --> 02:39:18.000]  called frack nation who sent me that that that's
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:23.040]  scary email from franny armstrong and i can also point out alex this is this
[02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:26.880]  is this is what shocks me about about that splatter gate
[02:39:26.880 --> 02:39:30.640]  movie that you that you we saw earlier on and this woman
[02:39:30.640 --> 02:39:34.000]  the people involved in this were not kind of your average
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:37.920]  scary eco fascist loons these were respectable people
[02:39:37.920 --> 02:39:42.240]  like jillian anderson you know the girl from the x files the actress
[02:39:42.240 --> 02:39:47.120]  she was in in in the splatter gate movie tom york radiohead
[02:39:47.120 --> 02:39:49.840]  you know they did the soundtrack to it they had
[02:39:49.840 --> 02:39:53.680]  famous football players from from various various and they mean
[02:39:53.680 --> 02:39:56.960]  i mean the main thing is a lot of people they get involved mean well
[02:39:56.960 --> 02:40:00.800]  and so it just so well but but but have you not noticed
[02:40:00.800 --> 02:40:05.600]  in the leadership of these groups it's really more like a eugenics death cult
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:10.080]  i think it is a eugenics death cult and and actually it's no coincidence that
[02:40:10.080 --> 02:40:15.520]  that a lot of the people who were big into eugenics in the 40s and 50s
[02:40:15.520 --> 02:40:20.000]  graduated to environmentalism in the 60s and 70s
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:23.520]  oh they admit that that's what they they changed the name of the journals over to
[02:40:23.520 --> 02:40:26.160]  that they admitted that was the strategy yeah
[02:40:26.160 --> 02:40:29.360]  at the heart of environmentalism is a deep
[02:40:29.360 --> 02:40:32.560]  misanthropy a deep suspicion of the human race this
[02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:36.720]  this generalized feeling that we do not belong on the planet we should
[02:40:36.720 --> 02:40:40.400]  we should really do the plans of favor and wipe ourselves all right let's be
[02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:43.520]  clear we those of us we don't belong we're only
[02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:47.200]  there to pay taxes and serve the kleptocrat control freak class
[02:40:47.200 --> 02:40:51.600]  they are the guardians they they need to continue on
[02:40:51.600 --> 02:40:54.720]  oh yeah ted turner will inherit the earth of course while the rest of us
[02:40:54.720 --> 02:40:59.760]  while the rest of us die i mean ted turner's buying up whole swathes of america
[02:40:59.760 --> 02:41:04.240]  well well well we're all driven into poverty because of the environmentalist
[02:41:04.240 --> 02:41:06.640]  causes yeah what do you make a prince charles saying
[02:41:06.640 --> 02:41:10.240]  don't take a hot shower and then getting money for to heat their
[02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:14.080]  their palaces and then old ladies have to get on buses to stay warm
[02:41:14.080 --> 02:41:18.160]  as came out last year because their gas has turned off i mean how does a prince
[02:41:18.160 --> 02:41:22.480]  with literally billions of pounds of stuff
[02:41:22.480 --> 02:41:26.880]  come out and tell people when he's got dozens of jets and valets and all this
[02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:28.880]  that we shouldn't be able to take a hot shower
[02:41:28.880 --> 02:41:34.240]  yeah well the scary thing is alex that this guy is our future king
[02:41:34.240 --> 02:41:38.080]  i'm hoping the queen will reign forever so that so that prince charles never gets
[02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:41.600]  to take over because it is extraordinary as you say the hypocrisy
[02:41:41.600 --> 02:41:45.360]  he jets he jetted over a few years ago to Rio de Janeiro
[02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:49.280]  with his massive entourage to tell us that we have just a hundred months left
[02:41:49.280 --> 02:41:53.600]  to save the world he travels in one of the world's most expensive sports cars
[02:41:53.600 --> 02:41:57.120]  and asthen martin but hey it's okay because it's powered by
[02:41:57.120 --> 02:42:02.400]  biofuels and this guy has the temerity to lecture us on how to live our lives
[02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:07.360]  more more frugally more eco friendly
[02:42:07.360 --> 02:42:11.120]  unbelievable let's get back to fracking because again there are cases where you
[02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:14.480]  got the some of these companies in in in areas that are being sloppy getting into
[02:42:14.480 --> 02:42:16.880]  water tables but from what i've actually gone
[02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:19.920]  and researched a lot of this stuff when they're going 10 000 feet down
[02:42:19.920 --> 02:42:22.960]  they're not even near water tables they've got a concreted in
[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:26.640]  they're they're getting the oil and then and then you've discovered and i've
[02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:30.480]  seen the articles that a lot of big oil the soddies the russians
[02:42:30.480 --> 02:42:33.680]  they do not want the texas especially where i live
[02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:38.480]  getting its own oil no if the environmental protection agency
[02:42:38.480 --> 02:42:42.800]  which i think we can agree is about as close to eco-nazism as it as it gets
[02:42:42.800 --> 02:42:49.440]  if even they cannot find serious evidence to show that fracking is is dangerous
[02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:53.440]  then i think we can be fairly confident that fracking is not a real problem
[02:42:53.440 --> 02:42:57.280]  look the reason the only reason that the american economy right now
[02:42:57.280 --> 02:43:01.200]  is not tanking more than it currently is the only reason
[02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:04.880]  is that it has been saved by shale gas and shale oil
[02:43:04.880 --> 02:43:08.560]  that has brought down the cost of energy it has made american jobs more
[02:43:08.560 --> 02:43:12.240]  competitive and that's on record that's on record they're not debating that
[02:43:12.240 --> 02:43:15.280]  no no it means that no longer is american
[02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:20.400]  industry offshoring it's now industry is now coming back to america america has
[02:43:20.400 --> 02:43:24.720]  been saved by shale oil and shale gas and there were lots of vested
[02:43:24.720 --> 02:43:28.080]  interests which do not like this everything from the green green
[02:43:28.080 --> 02:43:30.800]  movement campaigning for more useless renewable
[02:43:30.800 --> 02:43:35.040]  energy like like ugly landscape destroying sleep disturbing health
[02:43:35.040 --> 02:43:37.920]  ruining wind farms well hold on hold on before your
[02:43:37.920 --> 02:43:41.520]  cat leaves i see it in the background behind you there it
[02:43:41.520 --> 02:43:46.320]  it's about to jump off before your cat leaves uh the fake pita people
[02:43:46.320 --> 02:43:49.680]  and the rest of it are actually a bunch of eugenicists and i know because i've
[02:43:49.680 --> 02:43:52.160]  had family that actually worked and got into the
[02:43:52.160 --> 02:43:55.440]  upper sanctum before they got deprogrammed and woke up and got out of it
[02:43:55.440 --> 02:43:58.160]  a very few have actually gotten into the upper sanctum all the stuff that
[02:43:58.160 --> 02:44:01.200]  exposed pita a few years ago actually came from my wife but she didn't write
[02:44:01.200 --> 02:44:03.920]  the book on it they use the book primer to actually do the
[02:44:03.920 --> 02:44:07.120]  investigations and find out it was true in fact a lot of what she said i is not
[02:44:07.120 --> 02:44:10.480]  even known because it's so over the top that people wouldn't believe it
[02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:14.240]  but they are the really the animal liberation front basically
[02:44:14.240 --> 02:44:18.480]  and it's not even about animals it's about again letting governments say they
[02:44:18.480 --> 02:44:21.760]  have a vote because they vote for the animals but then they say you shouldn't
[02:44:21.760 --> 02:44:25.120]  be allowed to have a cat or a dog and they're going to have to be gotten rid
[02:44:25.120 --> 02:44:29.680]  of and then it should be outlawed for you to have a domesticated animal
[02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:33.680]  so that also ties into feeding animals your own animal is bad
[02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:37.280]  you're gonna have to give up your cat what's its name james it's it's called
[02:44:37.280 --> 02:44:42.000]  runty oh my gosh i can tell that cat likes you
[02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.880]  well what you put it out for the interview or it would be on the keyboard
[02:44:44.880 --> 02:44:48.880]  right now i i'm trying to get in with the uh with the animal
[02:44:48.880 --> 02:44:51.760]  freaks and maybe that maybe they won't come around and kill me when they see
[02:44:51.760 --> 02:44:54.560]  that i've got a pet that i care about but but but actually a lot of the
[02:44:54.560 --> 02:44:57.760]  environmentals are saying they're going to get rid of domesticated animals
[02:44:57.760 --> 02:45:01.600]  well i suppose you've got some various factions the pro pet faction and the
[02:45:01.600 --> 02:45:06.000]  anti pet faction maybe they'll they'll slug it out and kill each other
[02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:10.000]  well that's a nice that was a nice cat looks pretty friendly
[02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:14.720]  shall i let him in absolutely let's talk to this al-qaeda sympathizer
[02:45:14.720 --> 02:45:20.640]  oh my goodness i like cats but my uh my wife we got four dogs
[02:45:20.640 --> 02:45:24.560]  and when it went and when her uh when i first met her she had two cats and they
[02:45:24.560 --> 02:45:28.160]  got old and died but i said look no more no more animals i'm like
[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:32.240]  holding the line at a bunch of fish and lizards my kids have and
[02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:36.000]  and four dogs and snakes i like snakes as well
[02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.720]  well we're just well of course they don't want global warming they're hoping
[02:45:38.720 --> 02:45:44.320]  for an ice age the snakes yeah well i tell you it is simply insane well
[02:45:44.320 --> 02:45:47.520]  listen i appreciate you coming on and all the points you've made
[02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:50.960]  you know we've been talking now for about five six years in closing
[02:45:50.960 --> 02:45:54.160]  obviously everywhere i talk to people on the street
[02:45:54.160 --> 02:45:57.200]  and and i see the worldwide people are waking up
[02:45:57.200 --> 02:46:00.800]  that this is really just a power grab a new priesthood that wants us to pay
[02:46:00.800 --> 02:46:04.080]  indulgences to them but even though we were waking people
[02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:06.800]  up and winning the statistical battle in the polls
[02:46:06.800 --> 02:46:09.360]  they've already taken over the governments that are just moving forward
[02:46:09.360 --> 02:46:14.240]  a do you agree with that and then b how do we deal with that then
[02:46:14.240 --> 02:46:18.080]  well i think i think the two things we've gotten our favor
[02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:21.840]  are talk radio shows like yours and and the internet
[02:46:21.840 --> 02:46:25.600]  it's the the truth is on our side and that's the glorious thing
[02:46:25.600 --> 02:46:29.520]  no longer can these people close down the argument by
[02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:32.960]  by hiding behind their bastions of authority
[02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:36.560]  we can i mean why did climate gait happen
[02:46:36.560 --> 02:46:40.720]  climate gait happened because of the internet otherwise these institutions
[02:46:40.720 --> 02:46:43.760]  would have would have kept all this information to themselves that have
[02:46:43.760 --> 02:46:46.800]  said oh no we it's a breach of protocol we can't
[02:46:46.800 --> 02:46:50.480]  listen to information now the information is out there for those who
[02:46:50.480 --> 02:46:54.160]  want to find it and there was a hunger people i i think
[02:46:54.160 --> 02:46:58.160]  libertarianism is actually a very powerful movement i think i think it's
[02:46:58.160 --> 02:47:01.280]  growing all the time thanks to shows like yours thanks to
[02:47:01.280 --> 02:47:04.960]  stuff that i write on the internet i think together we can beat these bastards
[02:47:04.960 --> 02:47:09.200]  alex can i mention one more thing i have a there's another website i write for
[02:47:09.200 --> 02:47:14.000]  called bog paper dot com b o g p a p e r dot com
[02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:18.080]  and that that that includes some of my more out there libertarian stuff
[02:47:18.080 --> 02:47:22.160]  we're fighting back we're not going to let these these these people
[02:47:22.160 --> 02:47:25.680]  crush us because they are evil and we are the
[02:47:25.680 --> 02:47:30.000]  the keepers of truth and we believe in freedom and freedom is of course worth
[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:34.960]  fighting for and dying for well absolutely and and when you break in
[02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:38.960]  politically into what these people really think you're like wow we've heard
[02:47:38.960 --> 02:47:43.520]  of these people before in history and i the the hitler analogy is over used but
[02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:48.800]  he was a socialist eugenicist uh in viral nut uh i think i think
[02:47:48.800 --> 02:47:52.000]  well we don't have to use hitler we can talk about ourselves as we are like
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:56.640]  the the the greek states against the persians at salamis
[02:47:56.640 --> 02:48:00.160]  you know the the world's fate hung in the balance balance then but who won
[02:48:00.160 --> 02:48:04.000]  salamis it was the it was the the freedom fighters the
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:08.160]  greeks it wasn't the the persian tolerance
[02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:13.280]  absolutely absolutely i just think we have to realize these are not liberals
[02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:17.200]  i mean i consider myself to be a classical thomas jefferson style liberal
[02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:20.960]  yeah and and these people are the opposite of that and i'm sick of them
[02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:24.160]  stealing the the label liberal they are not liberal
[02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:29.280]  they're authoritarian control freaks and it's always been that divide between
[02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:33.600]  between the puritan control freaks and the freedom lovers and um
[02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:37.440]  well let's just hope the good work good guys win all right james dilling poll
[02:48:37.440 --> 02:48:39.680]  great to talk to you we'll talk to you again soon
