[00:00.000 --> 00:12.520]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.520 --> 00:20.960]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas alex
[00:20.960 --> 00:44.480]  Jones ladies and gentlemen get ready for the kickoff it just happened for
[00:44.480 --> 00:49.760]  another live worldwide broadcast I am your host Alex Jones and we are going
[00:49.760 --> 00:55.880]  to be here for the next three hours coming up today we have James Lane
[00:55.880 --> 01:00.080]  and Richard Grove who were in overdrive with us yesterday in the second hour
[01:00.080 --> 01:04.960]  we're going to get into the nature of propaganda and manipulation not just
[01:04.960 --> 01:09.120]  classical mind control drugging somebody or torturing them but programming
[01:09.120 --> 01:14.480]  them to the television and through the messages in the weaponized culture as I
[01:14.480 --> 01:23.520]  call it and then a telly blackwood who has a very popular youtube channel has
[01:23.520 --> 01:31.240]  been deleted after entering the Paul Revere contest getting 500,000 plus views
[01:31.240 --> 01:41.440]  for a video that they did where George Washington it's a comedy comes back from
[01:41.440 --> 01:50.320]  the past and basically in a joking way confronts Pierce Morgan and Michael
[01:50.320 --> 02:05.640]  Moore Michael Moore responded to this and we believe had the video taken down
[02:05.640 --> 02:11.000]  so we're gonna be getting to all of that and then Matt Dubiel is always shooting
[02:11.000 --> 02:17.280]  amazing videos with the TSA and FEMA core coming to his door in Chicago he's
[02:17.280 --> 02:22.040]  also the general manager of 1530 there in Chicago he's gonna be in studio with
[02:22.040 --> 02:25.080]  us the last 30 minutes today he's down here visiting friends and family in
[02:25.080 --> 02:31.640]  Austin Texas so he's gonna be popping by we're going to have open phones as well
[02:31.640 --> 02:39.480]  obviously they are hyping up big time the new civil rights movement quote gay
[02:39.480 --> 02:49.120]  rights and the Chicago a mob boss speaking of Chicago Rahm Emanuel said
[02:49.120 --> 02:58.680]  that quote will raise more money off people with alternative lifestyles then
[02:58.680 --> 03:05.840]  we will off of Jews he said gays are the next Jews of fundraising and that's all
[03:05.840 --> 03:10.600]  this is is hey come to the red carpet be part of this here's your new civil
[03:10.600 --> 03:13.880]  right we're gonna put fluoride in your water we're gonna force feed you GMO
[03:13.880 --> 03:18.280]  around the government kidnap over a million kids a year we're going to
[03:18.280 --> 03:21.760]  launch all these illegal wars against all these nations but as long as we have
[03:21.760 --> 03:25.600]  you know big gay parties and as long as we get peace prizes and as long as we
[03:25.600 --> 03:31.640]  act trendy why it's all liberal it's all loving and that's all it is is a cover
[03:31.640 --> 03:35.840]  to act like they're doing some type of big civil rights movement it's it's
[03:35.840 --> 03:42.800]  incredible and last night I took my wife to see a movie that itself was almost
[03:42.800 --> 03:49.040]  unwatchable with Will Smith and his son it looked like a made-for-TV movie from
[03:49.040 --> 03:54.080]  the 70s or something after Earth but but I wanted to go see it and so we went to
[03:54.080 --> 03:56.760]  see it and we got there about 20 minutes early so they were running all these ads
[03:56.760 --> 04:02.560]  for TV shows before the trailers even started and they had an ad for the
[04:02.560 --> 04:06.600]  fosters but I guess premiered in early June but it was an advert for its
[04:06.600 --> 04:13.720]  premiere in early June and they were it was a cop two lesbian one was a blonde
[04:13.720 --> 04:17.880]  one was a black lady and they've got a house full all these kids that have
[04:17.880 --> 04:21.720]  obviously been kidnapped from their parents because that's where the
[04:21.720 --> 04:28.080]  heterosexual kids are hunted and then and then sent to predominantly these
[04:28.080 --> 04:31.720]  foster homes that are just making money off of them and a lot of them are quote
[04:31.720 --> 04:37.160]  gay and then in the show it's like the heterosexual parents or the the the
[04:37.160 --> 04:40.920]  the biological parents know where they are and it shows the cop you know with
[04:40.920 --> 04:46.760]  their gun take dealing with them so the message is we're coming for your kids
[04:46.760 --> 04:51.560]  like Planet of the Apes we're gonna harvest your kids and that's the end of
[04:51.560 --> 04:55.760]  it and that's what this whole agenda is this is not about freedom this is about
[04:55.760 --> 05:01.400]  farming political cliques that are going to destroy why does the United
[05:01.400 --> 05:05.480]  States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare why do
[05:05.480 --> 05:09.960]  we have the highest cancer rates on the planet the highest rates of diabetes
[05:09.960 --> 05:16.640]  autism and every other major disease it all comes down to one thing we are what

[08:08.520 --> 08:12.800]  listening to the Alex Jones show
[08:22.000 --> 08:27.760]  I am going to open the phones up again for first-time callers on any subject or
[08:27.760 --> 08:32.920]  any topic you wish to discuss here on the broadcast today and I'm going to go
[08:32.920 --> 08:40.000]  over a ton of news obviously Telly Blackwood was an accomplished comedian
[08:40.000 --> 08:47.240]  and professional wrestler and he had a very popular YouTube channel with over
[08:47.240 --> 08:53.800]  nine million views on it the YouTube channel is Google account that you have
[08:53.800 --> 09:01.200]  to have via email to have a YouTube now which really violates monopoly laws
[09:01.200 --> 09:06.040]  that's another issue and all of his other Google related accounts were
[09:06.040 --> 09:14.320]  suspended and no notice was even given to him of why his account was suspended
[09:14.320 --> 09:19.200]  you don't get three strikes you don't get any of that now they just delete you
[09:19.200 --> 09:24.720]  because he did a satire piece where George Washington comes back from the
[09:24.720 --> 09:32.720]  past to the future and in a comedy skit water boards and obese Michael Moore
[09:32.720 --> 09:39.120]  and Pierce Morgan we're going to air part of this censored video here that is
[09:39.120 --> 09:47.080]  extremely tame we've had it's very funny though we've had over 500 good
[09:47.080 --> 09:53.160]  entries for the operation Paul Revere video contest and I said we will begin
[09:53.160 --> 09:58.080]  to announce the winners after July 4th and and by the end of July I should be
[09:58.080 --> 10:02.640]  able to announce the first place winner I knew this would be a big deal but it
[10:02.640 --> 10:07.480]  has basically dominated probably 20 30% of our time around here which is a good
[10:07.480 --> 10:12.360]  thing just trying to watch all of these and trying to categorize them and trying
[10:12.360 --> 10:18.000]  to post them on info wars calm and prison planet calm there's only a 30 or so
[10:18.000 --> 10:22.080]  up on the YouTube channel we need to add all the new ones on there it is a
[10:22.080 --> 10:26.360]  monumental task that we're building a special page that'll have maybe the top
[10:26.360 --> 10:34.400]  50 or so of these videos but it's so hard to to judge them because some people
[10:34.400 --> 10:39.960]  either didn't email the right address or the spam filter blocked it because we're
[10:39.960 --> 10:47.120]  finding people that made the deadline of getting them posted on YouTube and one
[10:47.120 --> 10:52.760]  other video site but we didn't see them till later so we're trying to find all
[10:52.760 --> 10:58.160]  the entrants as well to make sure and let me tell you if you think judging a
[10:58.160 --> 11:10.160]  beauty contest or a baking contest or a acting contest is hard imagine having
[11:10.160 --> 11:18.620]  500 at least good videos over a hundred of them are incredible some of them are
[11:18.620 --> 11:23.240]  better than what you see on mainstream television like a lot of them are and my
[11:23.240 --> 11:27.920]  head is spinning so the operation Paul Revere has been an incredible success
[11:27.920 --> 11:31.440]  David Knight's trying to head up collating and getting it all together
[11:31.440 --> 11:39.000]  with some of the other crew like Max Cabrera but again not only once this
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.800]  contest and about a month you know the winners have been announced not only will
[11:43.800 --> 11:50.640]  you you haven't announced by then we will then for months after be having people
[11:50.640 --> 11:56.240]  on as guests that were entrants and trying to talk to people that are not
[11:56.240 --> 11:59.840]  just the top three winners for a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in prize
[11:59.840 --> 12:04.680]  money but others about what are their ideas to try to make films with them
[12:04.680 --> 12:10.480]  fall wars calm and all of this is going to be going on while I put together
[12:10.480 --> 12:15.520]  which is really shaping up to be my greatest film ever Obama deception to
[12:15.520 --> 12:20.360]  that won't be its technical name it'll be Obama deception something a part to
[12:20.360 --> 12:25.880]  but we're in the midst of working on that and we're in the midst of finishing
[12:25.880 --> 12:30.000]  up the new studio and we're in the midst of obviously I'm trying to run the
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.120]  operation here to fund ourselves and I'm not complaining it's just that it's a
[12:35.120 --> 12:42.120]  full-time job I mean what I could do if I just had the money sitting there like
[12:42.120 --> 12:45.600]  the private fellow reserve does that can make up any amount of money it wants
[12:45.600 --> 12:50.240]  and give it to the to itself what I could do if I didn't have to go out in the
[12:50.240 --> 12:58.400]  destroyed crippled dying free market in the middle of a global depression slash
[12:58.400 --> 13:04.600]  recession depending on what region you're in and just battle to try to morally
[13:04.600 --> 13:11.760]  find the right products and sponsors to then make money to put it all all into
[13:11.760 --> 13:18.400]  this operation it is definitely historical and to see what's happening and
[13:18.400 --> 13:23.640]  to realize that Google delisted info wars calm and present planet calm about
[13:23.640 --> 13:28.240]  four years from the news aggregators Google says their mission is to be the
[13:28.240 --> 13:32.400]  web and they are becoming the web and they are above the law they're allowed
[13:32.400 --> 13:37.120]  to illegally spy when nobody else can they're allowed to run monopolies and
[13:37.120 --> 13:41.720]  violate copyright when nobody else can they're allowed to spy on people
[13:41.720 --> 13:45.640]  illegally and then not even get in trouble because they are a front for the
[13:45.640 --> 13:50.120]  global corporate government the global corporates don't want governments that
[13:50.120 --> 13:54.880]  can change hands with all the power they want a government as a front with a
[13:54.880 --> 13:58.800]  global corporate government above it that's above the law with diplomatic
[13:58.800 --> 14:06.880]  corporate immunity which is now being established and to see them all over
[14:06.880 --> 14:13.960]  YouTube now you search our videos you can't find almost all of them on the
[14:13.960 --> 14:18.560]  Alex Jones channel and some of our other backup channels that have four
[14:18.560 --> 14:21.840]  hundred something million views just on them and then hundreds and hundreds of
[14:21.840 --> 14:26.960]  millions of views on other channels but you can find them on other people's
[14:26.960 --> 14:33.240]  channels who have listened to me over the years and don't put my name in any
[14:33.240 --> 14:39.280]  of the search functions not in the title not in the description and then those
[14:39.280 --> 14:43.560]  videos will get a hundred thousand five hundred thousand views and it is totally
[14:43.560 --> 14:50.920]  freaking the globalist out because we have just been taking over YouTube owned
[14:50.920 --> 14:55.520]  by the Pentagon and the globalist in the offshore banks we have absolutely been
[14:55.520 --> 15:04.720]  using it against them and so now they're going in using any excuse to oh you do a
[15:04.720 --> 15:13.360]  joke of waterboarding Michael Moore you know it's okay to show that in all the
[15:13.360 --> 15:20.000]  TV shows it's okay to show that on the family channels you know on on on ABC and
[15:20.000 --> 15:26.760]  they show all sorts of violence and they're doing all sorts of things where
[15:26.760 --> 15:32.600]  if we search secrets of World War Z leaked and they didn't get us for copyright
[15:32.600 --> 15:37.240]  they didn't ban the video because all we did was show stills of it and it's fair
[15:37.240 --> 15:43.560]  used to critique it even if we showed the video it says no videos found when it
[15:43.560 --> 15:47.200]  turned out there's over a hundred copies of it on there so they are
[15:47.200 --> 15:54.160]  delisting us right now every way they can like we're a cancer when in truth we
[15:54.160 --> 15:59.560]  are trying to cut out the cancer so understand ladies and gentlemen when
[15:59.560 --> 16:06.280]  you hear this broadcast they are testing their their systems of censorship and
[16:06.280 --> 16:18.680]  control against info wars dot com and just as you see police all over the
[16:18.680 --> 16:23.440]  United States come over and tell people don't videotape me in public and then
[16:23.440 --> 16:28.560]  break their cameras and arrest them and charge them with false charges and as
[16:28.560 --> 16:36.960]  you see police tasering people that simply ask for a warrant at their front
[16:36.960 --> 16:44.280]  door this is because the police are being twisted and basically mutated into
[16:44.280 --> 16:48.600]  what police have been in every other authoritarian regime and there's a
[16:48.600 --> 16:53.680]  battle within the police as well where a lot of police are actually waking up
[16:53.680 --> 16:59.920]  the problem is so many departments are under federal guidelines and are bad and
[16:59.920 --> 17:04.120]  have been federally programmed that when you say no you can't search my car you
[17:04.120 --> 17:07.840]  don't have a warrant that they flip out on you and in some cases physically
[17:07.840 --> 17:11.760]  attack you or verbally berate you there's a new video of small town cop
[17:11.760 --> 17:16.040]  throws tantrum in response to knowledgeable citizen that's up on
[17:16.040 --> 17:23.800]  info wars dot com so these are the type of issues we know what tyranny looks
[17:23.800 --> 17:28.440]  like and we know that it's here and we know that if we don't speak out against
[17:28.440 --> 17:32.480]  it and wake up as a society things are just gonna get more and more decadent
[17:32.480 --> 17:40.280]  more and more obscene more and more corrupt more and more ridiculous as the
[17:40.280 --> 17:46.400]  aberrant tyrants act out against the public subconsciously begging someone
[17:46.400 --> 17:53.040]  to stop them this is the nature of criminology and if you look at the
[17:53.040 --> 18:00.480]  government and the bureaucracy and the way that they behave they are a group of
[18:00.480 --> 18:06.600]  control freak sociopaths psychopaths and mental patients who are trying to sell
[18:06.600 --> 18:14.640]  their system of corruption as trendy to the general public and trying to create
[18:14.640 --> 18:21.320]  government special interest groups that are given special protection by the
[18:21.320 --> 18:31.160]  government to make up the cult gang guilds that will be the enforcers of
[18:31.160 --> 18:37.380]  their tyrannical system but it's very important to understand the the the
[18:37.380 --> 18:42.200]  globalists are doing everything they can so that you can't hear this show so
[18:42.200 --> 18:47.160]  that you can't watch this show so that you can't go to info wars dot com and
[18:47.160 --> 18:52.280]  prison planet dot com and as their big cyber command system goes online that's
[18:52.280 --> 18:58.600]  on record to shut down the free web and to sabotage websites and to create
[18:58.600 --> 19:04.440]  internet IDs where you're just banned from the web this is their open plan and
[19:04.440 --> 19:09.960]  this is what's happening and we are seeing a massive intensification of it
[19:09.960 --> 19:14.040]  going on right now because we are effective but they're doing it to many
[19:14.040 --> 19:18.520]  other people as well that's why it's so essential for every freedom lover out
[19:18.520 --> 19:23.160]  there to do your own YouTube videos and on one other alternate channel because

[24:46.680 --> 24:50.000]  because I never seem to get to calls and then I'm gonna get into the news I'm
[24:50.000 --> 24:55.360]  gonna give you my take from deep research on what's really going on with
[24:55.360 --> 25:01.800]  this whole civil rights movement as Chuck E. Schumer calls it for quote gay
[25:01.800 --> 25:10.000]  and lesbian rights and what's happening on that front I'm going to break down
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.240]  exactly what's happening you can turn on the television and tell what's going on
[25:14.240 --> 25:20.400]  there you can turn on any Hollywood television show and you can see the
[25:20.400 --> 25:28.640]  agenda and by the way on record on record the agenda is admitted to be a UN
[25:28.640 --> 25:33.240]  official global program working with national producers of every major
[25:33.240 --> 25:40.080]  country part of UNESCO to stabilize population by reducing fertility using
[25:40.080 --> 25:44.800]  soap operas and sitcoms this is directly from the United Nations gonna be
[25:44.800 --> 25:48.240]  getting to that I just want to let you know what this is all about and then
[25:48.240 --> 25:52.760]  they make it a civil right and avant-garde and really cool and then they
[25:52.760 --> 25:56.960]  make it that you're hateful if you're not for it and so by all means teach our
[25:56.960 --> 26:02.640]  five-year-olds not just about sex while that would be pedophilia teach them
[26:02.640 --> 26:12.560]  about same-sex relationships and it's a civil right just ask the BBC with their
[26:12.560 --> 26:17.120]  top hosts continually caught with dead bodies of children I mean it's not
[26:17.120 --> 26:22.160]  enough to have sex with children I mean you got to have sex with dead bodies I
[26:22.160 --> 26:28.520]  mean every week some new BBC reporter it comes out it was pleading guilty to
[26:28.520 --> 26:33.400]  sex with small children or sex with dead bodies or Satan worship up but again
[26:33.400 --> 26:42.960]  I'm being hateful the truth is the ultimate thrill for these people is to
[26:42.960 --> 26:46.920]  force this on everyone I said I'd get to this later I went to a movie last night
[26:46.920 --> 26:54.040]  with my wife we got there about 25 minutes early I told her I didn't want
[26:54.040 --> 26:58.440]  to get there early I said they played TV ads for TV shows before this I said the
[26:58.440 --> 27:04.400]  trailers are too long we get there and we're subjected to one ad after another
[27:04.400 --> 27:11.680]  for current ABC shows where the dads are all idiots and then they cut to another
[27:11.680 --> 27:26.640]  show called the fosters and it's two women one of them's a cop of course the
[27:26.640 --> 27:30.160]  authority figure the message is the state is your husband and she's the man
[27:30.160 --> 27:35.640]  you know she she's the she's the boss and they've got a house just full of
[27:35.640 --> 27:39.160]  foster kids they've taken from their biological parents and they say that the
[27:39.160 --> 27:42.840]  bad guys I went and looked it up last night but I could see it in the ad the
[27:42.840 --> 27:46.720]  bad guys in every episode I guess they've had four episodes so far are
[27:46.720 --> 27:53.040]  biological parents but don't worry the female cop she she goes and takes them
[27:53.040 --> 27:58.720]  out daddy takes them out and then they say real aggressively in the voiceover
[27:58.720 --> 28:07.600]  it's a new kind of family America's new family and it's the blonde woman that the
[28:07.600 --> 28:13.160]  house slave with the other people you know of the state and she wears the
[28:13.160 --> 28:19.800]  uniform and she crushes the parents the biological parents and then the son who
[28:19.800 --> 28:23.720]  is the biological son you know they say oh you're the biological son he goes
[28:23.720 --> 28:28.520]  there is no biological son here it's like oh the see the only way to prove
[28:28.520 --> 28:33.080]  you're good is to get rid of masculinity get rid of the family because the family
[28:33.080 --> 28:39.720]  is hateful and I've shown you textbooks on air that they give the CPS that they
[28:39.720 --> 28:45.320]  teach at the University of Texas or it says the family belongs to an arcane
[28:45.320 --> 28:52.600]  age it's it needs to be done away with we've done whole shows reading these
[28:52.600 --> 28:57.800]  quotes and and we're going to get rid of it and we're going to do all this and
[28:57.800 --> 29:02.720]  all this is really about at a scientific level is so they can euthanize you
[29:02.720 --> 29:07.880]  and you won't have any family stand up for you and when you read the UN
[29:07.880 --> 29:12.320]  programs on this it's not about you're dancing around together you know and
[29:12.320 --> 29:16.960]  you're gay love and all this because I mean I'll be honest with people quite
[29:16.960 --> 29:21.680]  frankly this isn't even on my radar screen people think oh you hate what I do
[29:21.680 --> 29:24.960]  that makes it more fun no come on give me a break let's talk about the real
[29:24.960 --> 29:27.520]  world here let's talk about chemicals that are put in the food and water to
[29:27.520 --> 29:32.680]  sterilize people let's talk about how they shot up the gay community in
[29:32.680 --> 29:37.120]  New York with the HIV in the hepatitis vaccines is that because they loved you
[29:37.120 --> 29:42.920]  know they use your promiscuity as the vector to spread it now if you think
[29:42.920 --> 29:46.400]  being murdered by the government is cool then I understand naturally they have
[29:46.400 --> 29:51.240]  bug chasers they do some of them they want to die we're on the march the

[33:43.480 --> 33:50.440]  your phone calls and then coming up I'm going to get into some of this
[33:50.440 --> 33:56.320]  incredible news st. Louis police chief wants drones to patrol high crime areas
[33:56.320 --> 34:00.000]  and that's where they've had the military doing open martial law drills as
[34:00.000 --> 34:06.720]  well UAVs would also track suspicious vehicles drone spies on sunbathing woman

[34:17.880 --> 34:24.160]  continuing with some of the other news that we're going to be getting to that
[34:24.160 --> 34:31.720]  is just incredibly important obviously to say the least if you go up to info
[34:31.720 --> 34:40.120]  wars dot com you can actually see some of these headlines what's happened is as
[34:40.120 --> 34:42.880]  I had the stack of news here in front of me and now I can't find it so I'm going
[34:42.880 --> 34:50.720]  to the website myself friend Michael Hastings marked for death and what I did
[34:50.720 --> 34:55.720]  was as I actually changed that headline to make it a little bit more accurate to
[34:55.720 --> 35:00.320]  what the guests said on the show yesterday Michael Hastings told he would
[35:00.320 --> 35:13.640]  be hunted down and killed over mccrystal story so that's a pretty darn important
[35:13.640 --> 35:18.160]  piece of news right there because I'll be honest with you I hadn't followed
[35:18.160 --> 35:22.720]  Michael Hastings too closely until he died and I mean I knew he was what he
[35:22.720 --> 35:26.960]  done but I didn't know all the details that in his book he said the army told
[35:26.960 --> 35:32.880]  you we will kill you for this you are a dead man by multiple officers I didn't
[35:32.880 --> 35:39.960]  know that he told his friends in country in Afghanistan that he was told he was
[35:39.960 --> 35:44.760]  going to be killed I didn't know he told them right before he died that I've been
[35:44.760 --> 35:50.720]  told they're coming to kill me I didn't know you know the details that he was
[35:50.720 --> 35:57.240]  about to break a big CIA story and or that the family scared to talk and that
[35:57.240 --> 36:03.880]  they believe he was killed and now that's been in the news for two days I
[36:03.880 --> 36:13.920]  saw that in an RT article at the bottom of the story on Tuesday night so we
[36:13.920 --> 36:29.400]  called Staff Sergeant up and got him on the broadcast Biggs and he went to the
[36:29.400 --> 36:32.880]  funeral talk to the wife talk to the family I mean they believe he was
[36:32.880 --> 36:37.880]  murdered they believe the evidence points towards that and that's big news
[36:37.880 --> 36:45.080]  that his wife you know said quote I'm gonna take down whoever did this and
[36:45.080 --> 36:49.640]  and now we have a new article out today Michael Hastings told he would be
[36:49.640 --> 36:54.200]  hunted down and killed over a crystal story friends and family called for
[36:54.200 --> 36:58.160]  independent investigation I mean that's bombshell news and the controlled
[36:58.160 --> 37:05.560]  corporate media is so cowardly that this has been out now on my site for over
[37:05.560 --> 37:13.200]  a day and it's been out totaled for two days and even RT didn't think it should
[37:13.200 --> 37:17.400]  be the headline just buried in there oh the family by the way thinks he was
[37:17.400 --> 37:19.680]  probably murdered and he was death-threaded they said they were
[37:19.680 --> 37:23.920]  coming to kill him and he was told by Army officers I mean the family should
[37:23.920 --> 37:27.880]  be being interviewed we're trying to you know talk to him right now and they
[37:27.880 --> 37:33.280]  just say they have too much grief and they're scared but in a month or
[37:33.280 --> 37:37.200]  something and this will just be a swept under the rug
[37:38.600 --> 37:45.880]  this will all just be swept under the rug and this is the type of overwhelming
[37:45.880 --> 37:51.120]  information that we're covering on this broadcast I mentioned this yesterday I've
[37:51.120 --> 37:54.520]  since watched the local newscast about it where they report on it with a straight
[37:54.520 --> 38:02.520]  face and it's so incredible that the young man who wore a pro-second amendment
[38:02.520 --> 38:07.600]  in our a-shirt that said defend our rights was arrested and now they've done a
[38:07.600 --> 38:11.360]  gag order saying he and his family can't talk to the press about their right to
[38:11.360 --> 38:15.520]  keep and bear arms I mean that's completely illegal what the judge did in
[38:15.520 --> 38:23.480]  California judge orders first amendment outlawed in bank graffiti case and with
[38:23.480 --> 38:29.920]  a straight face they're like oh he wrote anti-fellow reserve messages in water
[38:29.920 --> 38:34.720]  soluble chalk you know like kids go out and draw pictures of flowers and a
[38:34.720 --> 38:40.840]  house and clouds or a puppy dog or Superman they don't arrest them they
[38:40.840 --> 38:46.000]  only arrest you if it's political the most protected speech and then the judge
[38:46.000 --> 38:50.240]  says the first amendment not only are we going to throw the book at you for
[38:50.240 --> 38:55.960]  something that's clearly protected speech but we're going to not let you use
[38:55.960 --> 39:00.200]  the first amendment as a defense and that's on the news like it's a good
[39:00.200 --> 39:04.600]  thing I mean ladies and gentlemen do you understand that this is like opening
[39:04.600 --> 39:12.520]  the portal on a spaceship to space and letting the atmosphere out of the capsule
[39:12.520 --> 39:21.320]  this is politically societally culturally suicide and I want to be
[39:21.320 --> 39:31.440]  clear whenever I get into this whole situation with the quote gay rights in
[39:31.440 --> 39:38.040]  the media this is all designed so that when you say hey what about a man and a
[39:38.040 --> 39:41.360]  woman what about this institution what about it and toward they could say oh
[39:41.360 --> 39:45.960]  you're hateful oh you don't want totally open borders you're hateful well
[39:45.960 --> 39:52.720]  nobody else has totally open borders well I don't want government run
[39:52.720 --> 39:55.640]  healthcare oh well you're racist and hateful well I don't want to turn my
[39:55.640 --> 40:01.720]  guns in oh you're racist you see this and it's simply meant to say you're a
[40:01.720 --> 40:06.240]  demon you're a criminal you're bad they have a national poll out where a large
[40:06.240 --> 40:12.480]  percentage of Democrats say they believe the Tea Party are terrorists that
[40:12.480 --> 40:17.720]  should be arrested well mark dice went out on the street and every person but
[40:17.720 --> 40:24.280]  one person he talked to that's not edited folks except for brevity where he's
[40:24.280 --> 40:27.640]  not just showing you the people that said arrest the Tea Party arrest all
[40:27.640 --> 40:32.040]  gun owners put them in FEMA camps that's what most Californians agreed with
[40:32.040 --> 40:37.400]  they all spoke English clearly they were black white Hispanic Asian you name it
[40:37.400 --> 40:40.840]  and they would stop us I agree with you you don't have to convince me they need
[40:40.840 --> 40:47.320]  to be arrested they're ready to arrest us folks I know about this from working on
[40:47.320 --> 40:52.600]  family court cases for people as a media person who has folks come to me I've been
[40:52.600 --> 40:55.560]  to the family court I've looked at the statistics I've talked to whistleblowers
[40:55.560 --> 41:02.400]  a large percentage of the children being taken from families good families are
[41:02.400 --> 41:16.600]  being done by weird gangs sex gangs weird sex cults I mean in ancient Rome and
[41:16.600 --> 41:21.640]  ancient Babylon usually the things were run by strange sex cults and they did
[41:21.640 --> 41:25.480]  different things but the point was it would be sex cults heterosexual whatever
[41:25.480 --> 41:34.840]  it was all sorts of weird ones look it up in history and you find out that you
[41:34.840 --> 41:42.720]  know the sheriff and her wife who's also a sheriff's deputy you know I've seen
[41:42.720 --> 41:48.400]  this all over the country will have four foster kids and then you're told by
[41:48.400 --> 41:52.000]  inside sheriff's departments you know those were taken from families right
[41:52.000 --> 41:57.560]  here in town and given to them you know it's it's things like that and then you
[41:57.560 --> 42:02.440]  go and observe it and then you go and find out families they'll even brag and
[42:02.440 --> 42:05.880]  go man you got some really good healthy kids you know ages two and five they're
[42:05.880 --> 42:13.280]  ours and then the courts are run in more than a third of the cases by kind of
[42:13.280 --> 42:20.240]  Janet Reno big sis ladies and the fact is that's what it is and then they take
[42:20.240 --> 42:26.720]  your kids and give it to their friends who are a female cult just like in the
[42:26.720 --> 42:30.800]  Justice Department they would call in the FBI top guys they call in the Justice
[42:30.800 --> 42:36.560]  Department men and say you know take your clothes off scum you know drink
[42:36.560 --> 42:41.320]  water out of the toilet move your stuff to the bathroom I can't say a lot of it
[42:41.320 --> 42:47.080]  on air you can go read the lawsuits they settled and it turned out they are they
[42:47.080 --> 42:50.360]  weren't even really lesbians they were just dominators so they would also demand
[42:50.360 --> 42:54.120]  sex from the men because that's a big part of this it's about power and they
[42:54.120 --> 42:59.640]  take testosterone these are just like supercharged crazy women and man they're
[42:59.640 --> 43:05.040]  just taking everybody's kids they I mean it is it is devilish and I got to say
[43:05.040 --> 43:09.200]  it's the and there are a lot of women that are you know gay or whatever who are
[43:09.200 --> 43:16.680]  nice people I'm not saying this as I'm talking about what is there what is a
[43:16.680 --> 43:22.920]  fact and then they use the nice gay community as fundraisers of this is
[43:22.920 --> 43:26.960]  your civil right you better give 10 20 30% of your earnings and that's what
[43:26.960 --> 43:31.960]  that's what the mayor of Chicago the godfather is in the news saying gays are
[43:31.960 --> 43:40.640]  the new Jews that's a quote because that they don't have family they don't have
[43:40.640 --> 43:44.520]  anything all they have are these are these dinners all they have are these
[43:44.520 --> 43:50.520]  banquets and then at the banquets they teach them no you need kids don't you
[43:50.520 --> 43:55.840]  want kids actually I do want kids we're going to get them for you gays are the
[43:55.840 --> 44:00.320]  next Jews for fundraising there's the there's the headline out of the news
[44:00.320 --> 44:06.240]  what is that Politico that's the examiner Washington examiner so I'm
[44:06.240 --> 44:11.480]  telling you how this really works folks just like in a small town you you get
[44:11.480 --> 44:17.200]  old white guys getting together boss hogging the mainly white population or
[44:17.200 --> 44:21.720]  the black population or you'll get black gangs feeding on black gangs or you'll
[44:21.720 --> 44:26.920]  get Hispanic gangs feeding on Hispanic gangs or Jewish gangs feeding on Jewish
[44:26.920 --> 44:30.960]  gangs I mean people put themselves into gangs and I'm going to your calls it's
[44:30.960 --> 44:35.840]  just that the what about the civil right and I'm having foreign banks till 85
[44:35.840 --> 44:42.080]  million dollars a month from the American people what about the civil right of not
[44:42.080 --> 44:45.560]  having general electric above the law and able to shut down all the power
[44:45.560 --> 44:51.000]  plants that they don't own so only they make giant profits out of artificial
[44:51.000 --> 44:54.720]  scarcity what about the civil right of not having hydrofluorosalic acid that on
[44:54.720 --> 44:59.480]  record lowers IQs added added to the water what about the civil right of not
[44:59.480 --> 45:03.240]  being taxed on property taxes so much you can't afford to send your children
[45:03.240 --> 45:05.880]  where you want to school so that you've got to send them to a government
[45:05.880 --> 45:10.680]  training camp what about the civil right of not having illegal wars carried out
[45:10.680 --> 45:15.160]  in our name all over the world what about the civil right of not of not having
[45:15.160 --> 45:25.320]  the NSA sitting there illegally spying on all of us no no no instead it's the
[45:25.320 --> 45:29.560]  civil right that you get free housing which means the government dulls
[45:29.560 --> 45:34.000]  everything out and they can bankrupt the middle class or you get the civil right
[45:34.000 --> 45:38.400]  if you get to come to America and get welfare and free tax refund checks and
[45:38.400 --> 45:41.680]  everything is really a corporate supplement so you'll work for wages
[45:41.680 --> 45:47.640]  that nobody else could live on to lower the overall wages or you read the
[45:47.640 --> 45:52.440]  official Earth Policy Institute and the UN has official programs on this look
[45:52.440 --> 45:58.520]  up the UN's use of sitcoms and dramas produced by Hollywood companies for
[45:58.520 --> 46:05.760]  worldwide distribution eco economy building an economy for the earth
[46:05.760 --> 46:11.680]  chapter 10 stabilizing population by reducing fertility using soap operas and
[46:11.680 --> 46:17.320]  sitcoms and they're now putting homosexual messages in these and that's
[46:17.320 --> 46:24.760]  while Obama was in Africa and the Africans got real upset about it because
[46:24.760 --> 46:30.120]  they understand just like GMO food being shipped in GMO seeds it is an attempt to
[46:30.120 --> 46:34.360]  break down the only thing these poor people have is their families they get
[46:34.360 --> 46:38.520]  the fact that they take care of grandma somebody's gonna take care of them they
[46:38.520 --> 46:43.680]  get the fact that they got their people their peeps they understand that folks
[46:43.680 --> 46:50.800]  and this is purely these messages are not about you know the 30s and 40s and
[46:50.800 --> 46:55.400]  50s and areas of New York where you know people in their own gangs were
[46:55.400 --> 47:05.120]  mean to conspicuously consuming homosexuals and so some people got beat
[47:05.120 --> 47:11.000]  up all because it was culturally seen as okay to beat up gay people because
[47:11.000 --> 47:16.520]  again that's predatory see now it's just flipping it predatory where the where
[47:16.520 --> 47:21.760]  where where the abused have been taught how to abuse so now they go out and
[47:21.760 --> 47:24.280]  everybody's been taught to be politically correct so people don't even
[47:24.280 --> 47:28.840]  care but there doesn't matter when your kids are taken and then they won't tell
[47:28.840 --> 47:32.880]  you where they went they went to groups in many cases that can't reproduce
[47:32.880 --> 47:38.000]  whether that's heterosexual couples or homosexual couples and you also have
[47:38.000 --> 47:41.600]  this destruction of language that's going on that I find to be extremely
[47:41.600 --> 47:49.320]  frustrating where they arrest people in Europe now for using the word homosexual
[47:49.320 --> 47:53.440]  because someone feels like it's hurtful to them just like they'll arrest you in
[47:53.440 --> 47:59.160]  Europe if you use the name for someone from Africa the scientific name I mean
[47:59.160 --> 48:03.440]  the word Caucasian is not a racist slur if someone starts using it as a
[48:03.440 --> 48:08.440]  racist slur should we ban it this is an attack on language and if you go look at
[48:08.440 --> 48:11.120]  the man on the street interviews we do in Austin or the man on the street
[48:11.120 --> 48:17.400]  interviews in LA most these people do not know what planet they're on but they
[48:17.400 --> 48:21.760]  know politically they better do whatever the television says and and in
[48:21.760 --> 48:27.080]  closing and I'll go to your phone calls as I saw last night when I went to a
[48:27.080 --> 48:32.440]  movie and they have this stuff on before family movies too they are
[48:32.440 --> 48:38.760]  bombarding with every message where males are bad fathers are bad it's rare to
[48:38.760 --> 48:43.640]  see a pro father message mother father changed a parent one parent two on
[48:43.640 --> 48:47.840]  passport applications the federal government has said that it's a EEOC
[48:47.840 --> 48:52.960]  violation in the federal government if you talk about your husband or your wife
[48:52.960 --> 48:58.800]  or a or a wedding you're going to you see those of us that are attracted to
[48:58.800 --> 49:03.440]  women men we're bad women are attracted to men you're bad and that's not seeing
[49:03.440 --> 49:08.160]  the entire group of people because I will not give you the power some of you
[49:08.160 --> 49:12.320]  want to think I don't like you so that makes your lifestyle more fun I mean
[49:12.320 --> 49:16.560]  give me a break I'm light years past all this okay for people out there that
[49:16.560 --> 49:22.840]  are obsessed with this sexuality for me is a very small part of my life and
[49:22.840 --> 49:26.600]  it's all part of this arrested development of people shoving their
[49:26.600 --> 49:32.000]  sexuality in front of you it's like people at work throughout my life now
[49:32.000 --> 49:36.640]  you've seen who will kiss in front of each other or grab on each other or
[49:36.640 --> 49:40.280]  stand in front of the window you know and sit there and hug and kiss and rub on
[49:40.280 --> 49:43.160]  each other in front of everybody they're doing it in front of everybody
[49:43.160 --> 49:49.760]  because it's just a form of getting in your space and that's what this is I
[49:49.760 --> 49:54.280]  mean I am sick of I can't we watch television because it's all anti-male
[49:54.280 --> 50:04.840]  anti-family absolute bias and then shoving in the face 24-7 well I mean I
[50:04.840 --> 50:08.760]  don't like how they are Nickelodeon bragged a few years ago that they were
[50:08.760 --> 50:15.240]  gonna sexualize under tens with both heterosexual and homosexual messages and
[50:15.240 --> 50:19.200]  then you look at the clothes they try to sell for little girls it's like hooker
[50:19.200 --> 50:24.800]  outfits for seven-year-olds I mean and again that is offensive that's that's
[50:24.800 --> 50:29.720]  sexualizing it's soft child porn you look at the billboards in the ads you
[50:29.720 --> 50:33.760]  know to sell some of the biggest designers and it's it's it's soft child porn
[50:33.760 --> 50:38.920]  this is the decadence of the ruling elite projected on to us but it's more
[50:38.920 --> 50:44.040]  than that above that there's a method of the madness to break up the family so
[50:44.040 --> 50:49.280]  the state is the mommy and the daddy and shows like the Fosters the man of the
[50:49.280 --> 50:54.080]  house is a cop woman and they literally go out and grab people's kids and the
[50:54.080 --> 50:58.960]  bad guys are the biological parents trying to get their kids back I mean

[55:17.320 --> 55:20.800]  break and put it on my screen for everybody the point is is that this is

[56:32.160 --> 56:40.880]  the air hello hello yeah you want to talk to you bro or what do you want to do
[56:40.880 --> 56:46.280]  yes yeah sorry my idea I have a suggestion people are always looking for
[56:46.280 --> 56:50.680]  solutions and what we can do and I know you always tell your listeners me to
[56:50.680 --> 56:55.560]  spread the word and that sometimes feels like a fuel attempt however you know we
[56:55.560 --> 57:01.240]  do our best I had an idea though that maybe you could possibly only you could
[57:01.240 --> 57:09.160]  possibly put together back in 1776 I'll spare people the history lessons but we
[57:09.160 --> 57:14.880]  had to have to create a declaration of independence and I think if you put
[57:14.880 --> 57:20.880]  together all your guests like a Gerald Salenty Ron Paul and you all came
[57:20.880 --> 57:27.040]  together and help come up with real solutions because you guys are aware
[57:27.040 --> 57:31.920]  you're not compartmentalized you're aware of what the plan is basically like an
[57:31.920 --> 57:35.880]  antique build berber they have their build a berg event where they get together
[57:35.880 --> 57:41.320]  and have their meeting why don't we have that well I mean just because we have a
[57:41.320 --> 57:44.760]  meeting I don't know what that's gonna do people just seem to have meetings
[57:44.760 --> 57:48.560]  after meetings in most corporations the army admits they spend most their time
[57:48.560 --> 57:53.360]  now having PowerPoint meetings I'm not poo pooing your idea entirely it's just
[57:53.360 --> 57:58.240]  that I mean the big thing is for people to stand up and say no as a society is
[57:58.240 --> 58:03.640]  the main thing that I'm basically trying to get out here no I understand I
[58:03.640 --> 58:09.000]  agree it's just that the in order to like really come up with some solutions and
[58:09.000 --> 58:13.760]  some plans and stuff like that we would really need like a team of people that
[58:13.760 --> 58:19.480]  are aware and are up at the level that like you Ron Paul just even Turra Peter
[58:19.480 --> 58:26.360]  Schiff Mark Kaiser I mean even if you really televised it as a you as a viewer
[58:26.360 --> 58:31.280]  I would gladly pay ten dollars to view with such a meeting where you guys sat
[58:31.280 --> 58:35.440]  around and brainstormed ideas well I mean that is an idea to have big
[58:35.440 --> 58:45.080]  conferences with public brainstorms that's a good idea this is GCN the
[58:45.080 --> 58:53.640]  Genesis communications radio network you prepare by purchasing gold food and
[58:53.640 --> 58:57.560]  firearms but if you don't have a home security system and you're missing a

[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:48.440]  let's go to Joshua in California you're on the air Joshua hey alex I like what
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:52.200]  Paul there was a stand before about an idea of a meeting I was thinking you
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:57.000]  know in terms of like what she's probably thinking in terms of you know what
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.480]  what kind of a meeting would you have that would be of magnitude like a
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:05.120]  Bilderberg that could really you know insight compare into the you know
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:09.400]  globalist elite that you know basically wanted to story everybody and I was you
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:14.120]  know that kind of ties into sort of my question is that you know you were talking
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:18.320]  about the other day you know things like religion you know really sort of sell
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:23.800]  you know any kind of call from this and you know I was you know doing my own
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:27.440]  studies and I noticed that you know you seem to fit the perfect description of
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:32.000]  what biblically is described as Elijah the guy that turns everybody basically
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.760]  back to their fathers and then you know their fathers to them you know kind of
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:38.840]  like the founding fathers and so I was kind of wondering what is your take on
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:45.080]  doing some kind of a thing like that well it's funny we've had two calls in a
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:49.480]  row doing this today I hear what the caller saying and I'm flattered I hear
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:54.120]  what you're saying really we're having a public meeting right now with this
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:59.600]  radio TV show and I'm trying to get people to realize the different crimes
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:03.440]  that are being committed against them and just how out of control all of this
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:10.920]  is and we just have to continue to grow the real media so that we could have
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:15.840]  continental congresses down the road that the public is able to actually see and
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:21.480]  hear about me so much of this is that the globalists still have not even so
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:25.800]  much the dominant media but even people that are awake still kind of think it's
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:31.680]  dominant one of the final dominoes to fall and so that's a big subject to have
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:37.640]  but I think conferences are good I think people you know having big debates are
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:43.080]  good but so much of it is about getting the public in their area to speak out
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:49.400]  and stand up and not comply I mean a free people uninformed people is what it
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:54.320]  takes to have liberty and that's what Thomas Jefferson said he said inform the
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:03:00.160]  whole the people and tyranny will vanish like phantoms at dawn and that's
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:06.160]  exactly what we need to do and so it's a process more than it is some big giant
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:09.920]  event that will happen I mean you could have an event you know a moment in
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:13.640]  television where something catches the public's attention and the
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:17.320]  establishment will declare that it's a defeat for liberty when really it's a
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:21.080]  big victory that's why they don't want me back on Pierce Morgan they don't want
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:25.040]  me back on any national TV show because I will get people out of their trance by
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:29.560]  pointing out how outrageous it is that a foreigner is here lecturing us about
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:34.240]  taking our guns when it's the serotonin reuptake inhibitors that are linked to
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:38.760]  most the mass shootings and how dare you try to blame us for what
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:43.160]  individuals do how dare you as a collectivist try to put collectivist guilt
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:48.600]  on me and how dare you say that if I don't support five-year-olds being
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:54.600]  taught how to masturbate at public school I mean I mean they might as well
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:59.960]  just let the pedophiles out of jail then you know how dare you say that I'm hate
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:04.000]  gay people or something if I don't want to teach kids how to masturbate you see
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.080]  they just sell the their sick agendas just to see what they can get away with
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:12.800]  by breaking our will and making us feel like we're guilty and have done
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:19.280]  something and we just have to point out how crazy all of this has gotten
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:26.040]  you hear what I'm saying oh yeah yeah I figured I was muted there but no I know
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:28.960]  I totally know what you mean like especially with the whole like pushing
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:32.720]  the agenda of like it's almost like a pedophilia like the sexualization of
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:37.840]  little children I was at a meeting with what they call the women's
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:41.080]  live movement and they were kind of pushing that agenda and I just straight
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.240]  up that's up and the people that were like yeah we don't want this for our
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:47.920]  kids or grandchildren you went to a women's live meeting trying to be nice
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.840]  and this is what was going on like the White House and a gay lesbian deal
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:55.440]  having like you know seven-year-old girls up there or whatever like why why at
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:05.640]  an event that's about sexuality do you have kids it's incredible tyranny is

[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:37.800]  film we'll still carry it but I'm not gonna get as good a deal as I got on it
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:42.600]  where I can give it away free so we'll still be selling it but we won't be able
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:46.760]  to offer it free very very soon probably today or tomorrow because we're
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:53.480]  selling out of the free dvd American dream when you get on blu-ray or on dvd

[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:01.520]  next three months of the film but I didn't mean to start this hour with a
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:05.480]  plug point is that's why they're here but we were talking during the break guys
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:08.880]  and I had you on an overdrive yesterday and again I've done a lot of deep
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:13.720]  research in the new world order writing reading their own writings and so I know
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:18.720]  what the real game plan is which you can learn to you just do the research but
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:22.960]  talking to mr. Grove and mr. Lane who I've known off and on over the years
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:27.880]  they really have done their research and have a fix on what's happening so I
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:31.800]  asked them during the break I said what do you think is that the underlying
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:38.920]  push for saying two men together two women together is marriage what is
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:43.960]  behind the sexualization of children what is behind showing men as fathers is
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:49.160]  being dumb idiots in every show what is behind it well the UN actually and I
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:55.600]  covered this last hour officially says they produce dramas and soap operas to
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:01.200]  break up the family worldwide and they say to reduce the family the state is
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:05.320]  in competition with it but you guys had some of the deeper reasons for it and
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:11.680]  again Huxley in Brave New World in 1932 published in 33 he said that would all
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:15.280]  be done the end of the family the end of the institution this is part of the
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:20.560]  dehumanization and so they try to make it like a civil right and like oh you
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:25.000]  hate these groups of people it has nothing to do with what you individually
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.040]  what your identity is what you stand for they're trying to program a false
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:34.960]  identity into what you would have been naturally ladies and gentlemen cold
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:40.160]  bloodedly did to then create artificial groups that want to operate as families
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:46.080]  but then are going to use the state to come and harvest biological families
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:51.520]  children to create this new structure where the mom is a cop and her her wife
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:57.240]  is a woman she's the man on these shows that are out there that I was just
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:02.320]  talking about in the last hour just absolutely incredible and I've kind of
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:07.080]  gone off on a ranting jag about this the show is called the fosters and I saw
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:12.440]  the promo last night before a movie and at the end they go the biological parents
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:16.880]  know they're here and the man of the house the the female cop she gets her
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:23.440]  gun and goes and takes them down well in the real world the they are attacking
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:27.360]  heterosexuals and again I'm not saying the entire group of you know people that
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:32.240]  have different sexual persuasions are doing that the government is advertising
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:38.440]  hey we want to put you in as the cult commanders we want you to be the new
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:42.360]  synthetic family we're going to provide you the kids we're going to harvest from
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:49.440]  the heterosexuals and the shows now are going from men or bad to saying mother
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:53.200]  or father is hateful frances banned it the federal government's banning at the
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:58.200]  EOC is telling federal employees who are a kept group of slaves more than others
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:02.520]  you know they're deeper down the rat hole that you will not say at a company
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:06.800]  party my husband or wife that is hate speech now that came out two weeks ago
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:12.120]  Gigi our net here in office to report on that from their own just department
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:16.760]  website so you guys have studied this in-depth you get into the mass mind
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:21.800]  control that's going on Richard Grove James Lane break down your take on this
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:28.160]  on this huge issue I mean it's genius to to frame sexualizing children and
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:32.600]  teaching them about heterosexual or homosexual sex at age five as civil
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:37.560]  rights training so so why didn't Jimmy Savelle of the BBC caught with all these
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:40.800]  kids he should have said he was teaching him a civil right well actually
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:46.480]  that's what Nambla says and the UN supports Nambla so so again if you
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:50.440]  don't turn your kids over folks you are a bigot go ahead well and this is what
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:54.120]  you know when you bring up you know oldest Huxley in the brave new world I
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:57.160]  mean he called us out how long ago I mean it's it's following this starting to
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:00.880]  right now his brother Julian Huxley was head of UNESCO you talk about the UN
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:04.160]  pushing this well here he here his brother was part of the education brother
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:08.920]  started it yeah so I mean we see we see how how this was all called out so many
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:12.280]  years ago and we're seeing it come to fruition now the hypersexualization of
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:15.480]  the children the breakdown of the family you know like you're saying where you
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:18.440]  can't even say the word mother and father means it's right out of the book see
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:21.960]  first they say don't say the n-word we agree that you know that's that's really
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:25.080]  mean but people have the right to say it now they're arresting you if you do
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:29.520]  next it's I mean I heard a guy say hey let's go get Chinese food to Hispanics
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:33.640]  and a white guy and they go don't say Chinese like like pretty soon it you know
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:37.320]  up and down is racist no and now that's where we're in this reducing the
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:40.880]  language down to where we can't communicate properly you know is it
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:45.000]  words are bad you know anyways I'm ranting go over that well I think what
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.120]  you guys are observing is that there's an agenda there's an agenda to solve the
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:51.680]  family brave new world is more like a business plan it was written as fiction
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:55.120]  but that's how they get the plan out there and so he said again in 62 as you
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:58.680]  know and brave new world revisited he said this is a real plan and in the
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:01.600]  ultimate revolution he's talking about how to control human resources so you
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:05.520]  have a eugenics agenda that starts with T. H. Huxley who was Darwin's bulldog so
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:08.680]  this all ties back up to you Jen he was in a secret breeding program and he was
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:12.320]  also in the x-club so there's also secret societies and intellectual
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:16.440]  inteligencia that are making their their their momentum known through culture
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:20.200]  and these are guys was hundred eighty I kish they are poly mass and they have a
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:22.760]  lot of office supplies as I like to say so they're well-staffed they're
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:26.120]  organized and we need to catch up to them and in every way doing our research
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:30.600]  and history break them down well brave new world is trying to make the world
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:33.920]  asexual where you have adults that no longer are bred with parents that's how
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:37.480]  the book starts out you're walking through this room of test-to-babies and
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:41.960]  the government the state is their parent and so how do they get from where we
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:45.920]  were in America to you know brave new world that's the process we're going
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:49.320]  through right now you get it where the state supplies children to the gay and
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:53.160]  lesbian couples that want kids right and you abort most the kids so that
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:57.120]  there's a shortage and they have actuaries all on that it's all planned
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:00.240]  out is what's incredible well when your listeners go to enforce or and get the
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:05.480]  state of mind the psychology control we have a long clip in there where all
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:09.040]  the sense is actually going through and describing the world we're living in
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:13.040]  today it was a Mike Wallace interview in 1953 and describes it perfectly even the
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:16.040]  pharmacological control of the anti-authoritarian personality which is
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:21.040]  so prominent now within psychology in this country well incredible they create
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:24.560]  cognitive dissonance and then they pathologize our descent to the
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:28.840]  contradictions that we see and that's what explain that in layman's terms they
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:32.040]  present us with contradictory information so if you watch cartel media
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:34.840]  you're gonna see a bunch of opposing stories that don't make sense that
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:38.800]  creates cognitive dissonance the attempting of two facts to reconcile as
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:42.880]  one makes you shut down right and so people sometimes get upset about that and
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:47.040]  so that descent is then pathologized by our education system and they say give
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:51.760]  that kid some SSRIs so that he you know they admit and then the SSRIs cause more
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:55.480]  mental illness so then now the answer is more drugs then it causes more mass
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:58.520]  shootings the answer is more drugs I can't help but notice that a lot of the
[01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:02.880]  pharmaceutical interests who funded MK ultra and you know all these pharmaceuticals
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:07.800]  today the SSRIs are very close to an LSD derivative so it's it's very much like
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:11.720]  LSD without the the trippiness well they're actually listed as in the
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:15.960]  hallucination class right exactly well and then use the tax-free foundations to
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:20.280]  fund okay we'll give you your hospital you know millions of dollars but you need
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:24.120]  to push all these drugs you know and this other operating well that's another
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:26.600]  credible thing that I found out like after leaving the corporate world you
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:29.240]  see all this information on the internet and it says the Rockefellers are bad but
[01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:31.640]  there's not really a lot of credible information but when you get into the
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:35.000]  primary sources there's a book called Rockefeller medicine men and basically
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.940]  what it shows is along with the education system and along with the
[01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:40.680]  foundations they were also in the medical establishments they were funding
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:43.520]  eugenics and they're funding Cold Spring Harbor they're funding the Nazis I
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:46.760]  mean there is definitely a lot of credible history that is not very much
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:53.400]  talked about they took over the entire private charity hospital program exactly
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:56.640]  and so that's another problem posing as charity posing as philanthropy going
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:59.800]  around asking for people for money and people think these are great you know
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:03.880]  great activities but as Norman Dodd showed in the Reese committee the Ford
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:07.960]  Rockefeller and Carnegie foundations were bent on dissolving America's boundaries
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:10.920]  denationalizing it their internationalists their globalists their
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:14.160]  collectivist their ideas of how philosophy work in the world are
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:18.680]  antithetical to American philosophy of reality that we own ourselves we have a
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:22.600]  right to our own private property and we will not be collectivized and again
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:27.000]  once they have standardized and patented all the genes they're saying they'll
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.360]  have to pre-certify they're already saying this embryos to decide if you can
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:34.240]  have that child because under collectivist health care while we're all
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:38.000]  not going to pay for your bad genes never telling you it's the chemicals in the
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.320]  environment and things they've added that are triggering the genes and this goes
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:44.120]  back to the early parts of eugenics where you were going to have to go in and
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:47.720]  get a license to have a child you know and if you had a you know bad genes in
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:51.560]  your family you'd be denied you know there was outrage after you know the
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:55.520]  National Socialist experiment but we've come full circle here we're coming back
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:59.320]  at it again you guys I'm sure have seen our videos and Mark Dyson's videos where
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:03.240]  we go out and ninety plus percent of people say arrest everyone that wants
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:08.640]  freedom confiscate all the guns put conservatives in FEMA camps now we go
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:13.480]  to trendy areas but these so-called liberals are not liberals at all they're
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:18.680]  like empty buckets that have had propaganda poured in stimulus reaction
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:21.440]  what you're noticing is you're encountering human beings who when you
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:24.120]  ask them a question or make some assertion say you know I've seen all of
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:26.920]  Dyson's videos and they're hysterical because at the same time they're sad
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:30.600]  that are called yo he says for Obama right so they support it because only
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:35.000]  authority he means he's good he's liberal so we're gonna put everybody in a
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.520]  death camp for Obama oh certainly let me we're gonna kill him get death camp oh
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:44.480]  yes ma'am condition in school to us accept authority unquestionably and it
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:48.640]  does help he's like six foot four know me they tell you in sales if a guy's

[01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:10.960]  presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind Richard
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:14.480]  Grove who is a forensic historian and James Lane both filmmakers are in
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:17.720]  studio and they know their stuff this is short segment long segment coming up
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:21.560]  we'll go to some calls place some clips premiered here on the air of the film
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:27.920]  that's released July 17th on info wars nightly news but gentlemen in essence
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:31.920]  what is the new world order what is their master goal and how are things
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:36.680]  going for them I would give an example of a book called the molecular vision of
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:41.360]  life by Lily Kay who is a MIT professor and it's about Rockefeller Caltech and
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:45.880]  the rebranding of eugenics as molecular biology to take control of human
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:48.200]  resources and they had to rebrand it because they were involved with the
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:51.440]  Nazis and because of the Nazi regime eugenics got such a and we have that
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:55.800]  book right right exactly and so in the info war store you can find this book you
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:58.840]  can get into it and you can start to read through and get this real history
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:02.520]  because it's a I had a hard time finding the book when I first found out about it
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:06.440]  so it's a resource that you're gonna have and you can read and reread because
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:12.040]  it's so much more credible than a tertiary source is the MIT professor that
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:15.640]  you know it has accolades on the back from some you know some very famous
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:19.880]  scientists in our history and so the fact that people like that support her you
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:24.040]  don't get in the club right again my dad was top of his class in Texas they
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:27.000]  brought him in as a high schooler and told him all this and it works he didn't
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  go along with it right I mean go ahead well the idea is that they're
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.160]  rebranding our culture so they're taking us away from being self-reliant
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:37.840]  individuals and they're trying to collectivize us as at the same time so
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:40.280]  that's a that's a mind game at the same time they have eugenics going on which
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:43.400]  is a physical reality game that they're playing with us that you know it's it's
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:47.120]  what they want to paint with the world is very much the brave new world vision
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:51.880]  of no parents in the future depopulation everything's automated and the
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:54.920]  people who don't choose the automation they live in the the woods like animals
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:59.120]  and they're not even treated as people so there's really an ego complex at the
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:03.560]  heart of this I think the people that do this lack love and satisfaction they're
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:07.200]  creating an artificial habitat construct in their own words so it's
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:11.760]  impossible for us to survive without them the final revolution it's a physical
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:15.160]  and a mental terrarium that they create that we have to learn how to escape and
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:18.200]  you're a slave until you find out that that exists what's incredible is they've
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:22.000]  written hundreds of books admitting it and they're doing it and and they're
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.600]  total criminals I mean it's not debatable it's actually trying to get
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:29.880]  people down to the level to where a dissent is completely removed from the
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:33.640]  equation now that like you said there's no Mulligan's there's no do-overs on
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:36.880]  this this is why it's so important to get involved in and get this
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:40.120]  information out well and like the guy writing on chalk writing with chalk in
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:42.440]  front of the bank and it's gonna be ten years of the kid wearing the t-shirt
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:46.120]  now you know 13 years in prison right so this is ludicrous people should
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:50.240]  recognize that the pieces hardcore authoritarianism Stalin would send you
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:54.600]  away for 10 years for for work you know worse free speech stuff I mean this is
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:59.000]  Stalin I once said an episode on the gulag archipelago and I was going
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.360]  through sultana's work and I really just I was horrified by the parallels I
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:06.440]  was noticing and it's like if only people had read this book maybe America
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:10.640]  wouldn't even be where they are right I read his book 20 years ago and I re-read
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:14.120]  it about three years ago I'm gonna be honest with you I cried on my back porch
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:18.920]  because we had already gotten like 80% there but we're not all the way there
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:22.400]  and that's the hope well it's different Russia never had a free press so there's
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:28.000]  like these vestigial islands of liberty left in the sea of tyranny so it's like
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.600]  a parallel there's like both worlds together now and they're trying to
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:35.640]  dissolve the old blood us out yeah well and all this I think compounds on to
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:39.800]  what Bruce Levine talks about in the movie learned helplessness you know
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:43.200]  everywhere somebody turns it seems like they they're powerless they can't do
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:46.400]  anything and eventually they give up there was experiments with dogs to where
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:49.600]  you know they kept getting a shock and no matter what they did and eventually you
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:53.360]  know they would open the the cage or whatever gave up and they just surrendered
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:57.000]  and this is I think one of the major elements of that we as a you know a
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.240]  free society have to overcome as it's learned helplessness I think that's the
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:03.920]  major tool that they use through a dynamic means of methods we just have
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:07.120]  to realize we're not dogs that if we can realize that situation we can choose to
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:09.640]  outgrow that status quo that's why they're always telling us we don't have
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:15.520]  free will but even top physicists have gone out and done the research and found
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:19.160]  no there really is free will that's what makes us human is controlling our
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:23.520]  environment and realizing that we can make choices about what we want to be
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:27.920]  they know that they're trying to build an artificial construct to remove those
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:32.040]  choices they do know that that is the modus operandi of all their operations
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:36.440]  and Hagel said that the true nature of an individual is to be free and soon as
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:38.600]  they discovered that they're like wow government's gonna be obsolete if
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:41.720]  everyone figures that out we better try to put the lid on the jar here and keep
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:45.160]  all these fleas in and train them and break and then they pose as if they're
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:49.280]  the humanitarians they're the opposite you talk about the gayling dialectic the
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:52.640]  problem-reaction solution you know and I know your listeners are familiar with
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:56.240]  that we actually interview Kurt Haskell in the film is a real-world example of
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:00.560]  the gayling dialectic at play you know he was a witness there of the
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:04.760]  underwear bomber you know you know the story government run yeah and then here
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:07.680]  comes Chertoff who actually has financial interest in the naked body
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:11.640]  skinners you know pushing that you know the after the after the fact they'd
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:14.800]  already been built they were being delivered the next week it was all
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:18.760]  segway as perfect PR well that's another thing I learned after I left the
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:21.440]  corporate world has shocked me and it's illustrated in a book like Trevor
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:26.240]  Erison's terror factory where FBI makes these terror you know 14 out of 22 in
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:29.680]  past 9-11 have been made by the FBI according to New York Times look at a
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:33.280]  monstallon you know I mean he just said they're giving me explosives to give
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:36.200]  these guys that goes into witness relocation we never heard from again
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:40.920]  CBS actually ran the tapes where the FBI handler saying yes well he said they
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:44.720]  told him give him real explosives he said no I'm not they go yes you are and
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:48.520]  detonators and then stood down and let them bomb the building we'll be right

[01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:25.640]  you take the red pill you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the
[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:34.760]  rabbit hole goes remember all I'm offering is the truth nothing
[01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:50.560]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show all
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:53.680]  right I know we got callers across the board holding I'm going to get to you
[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:58.400]  with our guest but these filmmakers have done their research they really know
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:04.080]  deeply what they're talking about and within this knowledge is the future
[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:09.240]  we cannot just turn the world over to globalists that are busily dumbing
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:13.120]  everybody down so they can take over the planet because from my research once
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:16.840]  they have full control they're going to reduce the population in their own words
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:22.440]  between 80 and 90 plus percent and some of their documents show even more but
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:25.440]  they don't tell their own minions that you know they give them numbers where
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:30.000]  they think that it's gonna be you know only 80 percent or so and the people
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.800]  that are part of this really get on power trips that they've been let in on
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:38.800]  this I mean if you talk to any biology department head at a major university if
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:46.440]  you talk to any head of computer science or nanotech if you talk to any anybody
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:49.640]  at any major university when I had that big professor on yesterday the head of
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:55.600]  their computer science research nanotech cybernetics department and he said yes I
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:58.480]  work with Ray Kurzweil yes I work with all these people and I looked it up he's
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:02.080]  on record working with them on he goes yes it is true that you know most of the
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:05.760]  establishment is just planning to get rid of everybody so I'm I think we should
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:10.360]  have a debate about this I mean that's the thing folks this is the what you're
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:16.160]  hearing here for the PhDs and people that work in academia they'll sit there
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:19.800]  and go well there are too many people aren't there
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:26.960]  here in Austin Texas has the Austin head of agenda 21 here admitting that
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:30.960]  depopulation is part of their agenda actually well it's one of our
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:35.200]  reporters went out was it John Bounder Merlissa Milton I mean we've got that
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:38.360]  bombshell interview where there's two of them and you go talk to the professor
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:44.040]  the head of the UT agenda 21 program was that you oh it was you and Melissa
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:47.840]  that's why I was confused who it was and he just goes yeah that is part of the
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:53.800]  plan and then he starts going look at my plaque from the CIA huh huh I'm a
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:58.800]  made man baby yeah well I mean they're joking with themselves and I don't think
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:01.600]  we should believe their jokes anymore and people take it seriously that over
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:05.640]  populations a real fact but if you study the numbers Western countries aren't
[01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:09.840]  aren't keeping up with the with the death rate and so we're underpopulating we
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:13.680]  have 1.3 children and you need two people to replace two people so that's the
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:17.520]  problem and that's why when we've already been replaced by predominantly Latin
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:22.080]  America which is fine with me as long as we get them to be free minds and not
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:25.320]  programmed by the globalist so I tell the Latin Americans what do you mean
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:29.640]  open up the border more so you win in a la raza la reconquista see this the
[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:34.080]  globalist seller racial base deal but only only when it's being used to
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:37.680]  destroy a nation state it's not even really a racial base deal more divide
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:41.160]  and conquer well or divide and conquer and the other idea is that what you have
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:45.960]  today is the technotronic era the post-industrial world we created they
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:48.880]  created a bubble when they created the industrialized world they they need
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:52.360]  overpopulation to an extent to create all this technology so that they could
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:55.720]  harness humans build robots and get rid of the rest of us because that's part of
[01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:59.800]  their bigger and they call this the technotronic bloom and you're talking
[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:03.520]  about Brzezinski's book right and so I got into Brzezinski not because of his
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:07.160]  political ideas but because of his work on cybernetics and if you look at any
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:10.320]  of his books and you go to the index and look up the word cybernetics he's gonna
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:13.440]  tell you how the collection of information is being used to collectivize
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:18.240]  individuals and control people socially and it's a form of cybernetics which
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:21.920]  comes from a Greek word Kyber needies which means governor or helmsman or
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:26.000]  you know so it's about the art of ruling nations the art of ruling many
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.680]  individuals to de-individualize them and collectivize them collect their
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:33.040]  information predict their behavior and control and monopolize the markets but
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:37.200]  this is a cybernetic towards our end not towards our empowerment can you
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:40.760]  imagine if we had altruists and people that really wanted to go to the stars
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:44.680]  we'd already be there I mean these people but they want to go back to
[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:47.480]  feudalism well I think they also the priorities are messed up why are we
[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:50.560]  going to other planets if we can't figure out how to like work out problems
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:54.160]  without using violence on this planet if we if we're you know if our governments
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:56.760]  in the way the world is being run is through force fraud coercion and
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:59.720]  aggression why do we want to spread that to other planets shouldn't we just
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:02.400]  figure some stuff out here and shouldn't we maybe allocate some of the
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:06.640]  resources that we're using for our insecurity as our you know a defense
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:09.720]  budget you know it's our insecurity budget like shouldn't we take some of that
[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:12.600]  funding and maybe do some stuff for you know people in this country who whose
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:16.080]  families worked hard and paid into those funds instead of but if you empower
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:19.520]  people you've got to compete with them that's a that's a problem for people who
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:23.000]  are lazy and people who have been born into some sort of trust fund world where
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.640]  they didn't have to work for their money there's a lot of other honest hard
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:29.560]  working people out in the world who are getting screwed because they do not know
[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:33.080]  that there are predators there are sharks out there there are dishonest people
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:36.800]  there are con men and you have to be able to discern fact from fiction and
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:40.440]  people lie using words so you have to parse the words that individuals use
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:45.880]  sure and how do you think it's going Richard Grove and James Lane for them
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:49.360]  right now I think they're on the fence and they really don't even know it
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:53.400]  because so many people are waking up that we didn't even intend to wake up
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:57.040]  because of what's going on there's just an accumulation of momentum the
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:00.640]  grovemen of what's going on as far as getting on people's radar to say wait
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:03.560]  that's that's idiocracy like that's that's supposed to be a fictional movie
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:06.920]  it's going on in our reality like things are getting just a little too crazy it's
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:11.040]  getting just a little bit too close to a dystopian isn't it the human survival
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:14.880]  instinct is overriding even the globalist programming well and so much
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:18.400]  information is coming out now me look at the NSA doing we were talking about this
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:23.080]  before we're you know 96 we're talking about carnivore echelon you know 2006
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:25.840]  so Mark Klein broke the deal about the NARA systems at the AT&T
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:29.760]  communication hubs were pulling off petabytes of data a month it just in
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:33.440]  one regional hub you know and you try to talk to people about them like oh you
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:37.160]  know again conspiracy theorist but now it's out in the mainstream news that yes
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:40.480]  NSA is monitoring all of your emails your phone calls and and now they're
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:44.040]  starting to recognize that I think that in combination with you know as this
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:48.040]  information this worldview the true view of you know world history is starting to
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:51.640]  become more prominent we're approaching critical mass and I think they're
[01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:55.360]  scrambling they're reverting to a more overt physical level of control now
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:58.480]  because they I think there's I think they're afraid well you know George
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:03.840]  Arwell and Huxley as you know had had a debate in letters before he died in 49
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:10.000]  about whose book would be more accurate would it be a 1984 dominant system or
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  would it be a a brave new world Huxley system and Huxley as you know bragged
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:21.240]  well it's my system of pharmacia and dehumanization where they don't even
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:28.000]  know their slaves that will win and he he's somewhat convinced Orwell but maybe
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.840]  Orwell was right well I think we were actually living currently living in an
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:35.920]  amalgam of the two yeah Orwell was a student of Huxley and Huxley's
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:40.720]  grandfather taught HG Wells so you see an ominous continuity of Fabian
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:44.960]  socialism of the use of science fiction to create these agendas that was a five
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:49.760]  family interbreeding program on record right with the Wedgewoods and so the
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:54.520]  galtons yeah so they've been studying us for a long time they've been studying
[01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:58.040]  the animal world as well to try to figure out to crack the you know the
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:01.880]  nut of the human spirit to crush our spirit to make us submit that's the
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:05.200]  game on the planet thus far is there are people in control use force rod and
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:08.800]  coercion and they try to make us submit these are the most uncool people and I
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:11.960]  say don't give them the satisfaction why do they deserve our submission why
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:16.920]  what have they done to earn it and they said we would love our servitude well
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:20.240]  they said that but I don't know if they can do that if we're still using reason
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:25.640]  and but if they say we're gonna teach your five-year-old how to have to brutal
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:30.440]  sex acts if we tell them it's civil rights it's okay Jocelyn elders I mean
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:34.080]  you know these types of things what is there be brings up in the creepy old
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:37.400]  woman talking about helping five-year-olds masturbate and reason I
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:40.400]  bring that up is these are crazy people well I mean you're not supposed to be
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:43.440]  thinking about stuff like that well nothing that we bring up in the state
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:49.360]  of mind is you know propaganda and how you grenades you know actually change
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:53.320]  the language it's not the Department of Wars Department of Defense as you brought
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:56.880]  up in the film you know it's changing the words changing the language and
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:01.320]  every time that that we actually cut them off they step back and repackage it
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:05.320]  and come at us again you know with it oh it's no it's no longer a real idea it's
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:10.800]  the you know it's no longer a war it's a kinetic action yeah and now he came out
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:14.560]  the fiction writer who's what 30 years old they've hired at the Pentagon to do
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:20.440]  all this writing he came out and said this is a violent nonviolent aid we're
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:23.840]  giving the Syrian rebels his brothers the president the CBS right yeah talk
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:27.080]  about Rhodes so here's a here's a guy who I was like how does this guy have
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:30.480]  qualifications to be a deputy national security advisor I think that was his
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:34.400]  official title 30 years old fiction writer yeah that's that's what we're at
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:38.120]  in America right now and I think we need to wake up from that American dream well
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:45.480]  I mean they literally write fiction and people believe it so fiction is made out
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:48.880]  of declarative sentences we have to question that is that really real is
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:51.840]  there a basis in reality are they talking about things that exist are they
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:56.240]  talking about some nebulous ambiguous particular that's not defined and so
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:00.040]  it's by observing identifying defining our terms removing contradictions and
[01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:03.400]  communicating that we get back to reality and express knowledge and wisdom to
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:06.840]  each other instead of having divide and conquer and circumventing the media
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:10.200]  where they're getting this fiction just handed to him and talking like it's
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:13.480]  this is reality and given that as news you know getting that straight from the
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:18.280]  government or corporations we're becoming the media Rachel Maddow road
[01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:23.480]  scholar says with a straight face Alex Jones says there's giant wasp under the
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:27.200]  U.N. building he actually says that he's crazy it's time to not listen to him
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:32.120]  that is I never talked about giant wasp that is a 100% line and then she told
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:38.640]  like five other lies literally preying on her audience folks road scholars are
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:42.720]  dedicated to worldwide eugenics worldwide evil and the end of the family and
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:47.000]  tell them it road scholars okay so in the in Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton yeah
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.680]  there's a tragedy and hope by Carol Quigley in 1966 textbook that had its
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:54.600]  plates destroyed and they reprinted only the second half of the book as a
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:44:00.520]  history the history of the world since 1939 and so what Quigley does in this
[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:04.080]  book when you get the whole uncensored copy which this is an uncensored copy
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:07.000]  that includes all the pages that were censored out of the other versions there
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.320]  is an agenda there is a plan names are named Quigley had access to the official
[01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:15.160]  CFR pilgrim society all these different Anglo-American establishment resources
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:19.240]  and archives and he was able to map out the Rothschild family the CFR all these
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:22.280]  different working groups and what their agenda is tracing it back to the last
[01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:27.120]  will and testament of Cecil John Rhodes who founded De Beers diamonds and
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:30.920]  gold and he said I'm gonna set up a British covert worldwide empire and
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:33.560]  he was funded directly by Lord Rothschild and his will and in the
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:37.440]  Rhodes Scholar Trust in the Sir Anthony Kenny book talking about the history of
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:40.760]  the Rhodes Trust it says it goes back to the Rothschilds and who runs all the
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:45.320]  major congressional publications the Rothschild banking empire roll call
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:49.360]  congressional quarterly I believe the economist and they also helped to found
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:52.840]  the London School of Economics a Fabian socialist institution so really his
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:57.440]  symbol is a wolf in sheep's clothing right yeah absolutely so these people if
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:00.520]  you just look at their symbols you can tell what they're up to but they expect
[01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:03.320]  that people won't read that people won't look at these things that people just
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:06.480]  will not use their five senses on in their observation skills and they're
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:10.320]  God-given creativity and their inspiration and their imagination to
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:13.200]  figure out like there's a bunch of odd confusing pieces that were presented
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:15.880]  with every day how do these things fit together and which of these things are
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:19.320]  lies to deceive us and where's the truth that I need to focus on to survive one
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:23.720]  thing that we did when we went to CPAC Ron Paul won the straw poll the second
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:27.800]  time and everybody was very intent on being there and actually cheer for them
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:30.960]  there they had the year but the time before they all left and so that a lot
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:35.320]  of the more establishment republicans said we're booing and so we go there and
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:40.520]  I recorded it and when I watch the Fox News clip it shows the booing and the
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:43.920]  guy had on a different shirt in a lanyard from the year before now how in the
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:47.120]  world does that actually get put in from your last year's archive you put in the
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:52.240]  that on purpose psychological we put that it is a Psyop and so we actually put
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:55.720]  together the videos side-by-side and showed that everybody cheering it was
[01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:59.120]  overwhelming applause and cheers you know and they're asking Ron Paul he was
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:02.240]  like well what how did you feel when you got booed you know a second time
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:05.880]  basically and Fox News actually had the issue of retraction because you know I
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:08.440]  think there was three different videos out there that actually got the
[01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:11.440]  information out and it was you know it embarrassed them and that's what we have
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:16.320]  to do we oh listen I've had people go my gosh I Bloomberg called me and asked
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:20.600]  questions and they actually misquoted me on purpose they lied to me and said it
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:24.480]  wasn't a hit piece and I said of course they did it was such a hit piece I mean
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:27.920]  that that disturbed me when I read that because that Alex Jones gonna blow
[01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:31.000]  everything up it says that you make bombers and the tweet that I put out is
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.520]  no the FBI according to the New York Times the FBI makes bombers that's on
[01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:37.240]  record there's no there's nothing on record that you've ever made a bomber
[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:40.760]  that you've ever influenced anyone to take my listen I'm trying to stop violence
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:43.440]  everybody knows that right people are asking me because you know I live in
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:46.720]  Oklahoma you know with the tornadoes everything like did Alex say that you
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:50.640]  know Obama used the weather weapons to create the tornadoes no you just brought
[01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:56.800]  up the point that there was patents on technology exists you know and so then
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:59.440]  they take everything you say out of context again this is oh I got called
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:03.040]  by Esquire because they got a big coverage story coming out on me and the
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:05.760]  guy said did you really say that and I said you know what I'm not even gonna
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:09.240]  defend it I said okay I'll look up the YouTube where I said it you know what I
[01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:12.480]  said you know what I'm not even gonna look up what I said right whatever you
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:16.520]  want you know what go ahead and say I did that because I don't care I didn't
[01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:22.040]  say that a lady called up and said I think that they made this tornado do
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:25.640]  this and I said no it's mainly big hurricanes and weather systems this is
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:29.400]  all patented so I can't say they did it but it's on record that this weather
[01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:33.560]  warfare stuff exists and Maddow in between saying I believe giant wasp live
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:37.040]  in places went with that and so did a bunch of other national TV that's what
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:40.440]  they've got to do folks is lie to you and I think it's a sign of weakness
[01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:43.800]  because the reason that Maddow house to do that never address your point is
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:47.220]  because she treats her audience like they're a bunch of idiots and she her
[01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:50.280]  arguments are intellectually bankrupt she never addresses any of the facts she
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:52.920]  had she attacked she was a messenger which is a fallacy and you must be
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:56.640]  effective or they wouldn't be doing right well sure but I mean the my point is
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:00.480]  saying I don't build bombers I build bomb I mean I don't build bombs I build
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:03.720]  bombers saying that I believe giant wasp live under the you know the UN
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:06.920]  building I mean they're really lying about me all over the place what do you
[01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:12.480]  think that signifies weakness desperation unprepared for these types of
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:15.640]  things coming on to their radar because when the road scholars were founded
[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:19.160]  there was no social media or internet or any things their their agenda has stayed
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:22.560]  the same through and they're trying to adapt and evolve and it shows again
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:25.200]  that they're intellectually bankrupt that they they have no reason they're
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:28.480]  acting irrational and I think we should just call them out on that and in free
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:31.840]  humanity is adaptable and we're taking the tools that were meant to enslave us
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:34.880]  and using it to fight them you know and that's what some of the most effective
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:37.640]  tools that we've got right now I'm gonna skip this network break as we're so far
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:41.080]  behind and I promise to go to some calls but let's go to this clip here the
[01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:45.720]  elite versus individuals from the film available at info or store.com state of
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:48.560]  mind here it is
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:59.440]  in an attempt to assist the state a 14th century Italian named Nicolo Machiavelli
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:04.760]  crafted several books intended to help the ruling elite dominate their subjects
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:09.520]  with the most effective psychological warfare techniques available to the
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:14.920]  world at that time and he was trying to convert the Medici family into hiring
[01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:19.000]  him to provide political advice. Conspiracy is the story of history is the
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.680]  story of plunderers taking care of people who produce they claim to take
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:25.440]  care of them through government which doesn't give you anything it doesn't
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:29.280]  take away first so it's not creating something out of nothing it's very real
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:32.000]  what they're doing they're taking your rights or taking some people's rights
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.960]  and adding more to someone else's rights. Concurrent to Machiavelli's efforts the
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:41.000]  consequences of tyranny were sowing the seeds of liberty throughout Europe with
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:46.320]  authors like Etienne de la Buetti of France leading individuals to consider
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:52.320]  their situations and discover effective means to achieving liberty for all. So
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:56.240]  this whole idea of Machiavelli telling the ruling elite how to do this in a
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:01.440]  more efficient and you know you know effective manner without people directly
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:04.480]  knowing about it but his mistake is that these books get out there and other
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:07.880]  people start to read these books because it's not just the ruling elite this
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:12.120]  starts to have an influence in Europe. You've got a character named Etienne de
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:16.600]  la Buetti who writes a discourse on voluntary servitude and basically what
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:20.040]  de la Buetti does is he shows you that everything at Machiavelli told the
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:24.560]  ruling elite about how to control you is undone when you understand it to you
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:28.760]  know the nuts and bolts level where you can then withdraw your consent and that
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:35.480]  only then are you free. We control you. We control your mind. We make you believe
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:41.600]  you have no creative power. We make you forget you have imagination which is the
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:47.720]  core capability from which you can invent your own reality. That's right
[01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:51.240]  whatever humans envision look at science fiction a hundred years ago we can
[01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:55.880]  build so they program us with predictive programming with a nightmare vision so we
[01:50:55.880 --> 01:51:00.720]  accept that as our future instead of us just simply having imagination and that
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:04.040]  just means looking deeper into what they're doing and Machiavelli just like
[01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:08.000]  the head of the Georgetown political science Bill Clinton's mentor he wanted
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:13.840]  to write a weapons technology book on on on Cy war info war and basically what
[01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:18.360]  Machiavelli did 500 years ago curl quickly did in the 60s with tragedy and hope
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:21.720]  when it's not the only book they quickly wrote there's Anglo-American establishment
[01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:25.280]  evolution to civilizations and there is one on political weapons and in future
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:29.160]  technology and so basically what you're seeing is he was taking in a macrocosm
[01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:33.080]  of how history has worked and how these civilizations have risen and fallen and
[01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:36.520]  then he's basically showing you okay now here's the 20th century here's the
[01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:39.800]  Anglo-American establishment here's these people going off an agenda that's
[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:44.760]  funded by the world's largest financiers and they are moving ahead without much
[01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:47.800]  resistance through much of the 20th century they're able to turn our
[01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:51.520]  education system into a system of schooling not to make individuals who
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:54.520]  know how to learn anything for themselves but to make obedient servile
[01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:58.560]  workers in the tradition of the Prussian education I talked to a lot of adults
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:02.640]  and they there is no one home right they don't have any original thoughts they
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:07.680]  just repeat and there's no one there they've ruined these people but it
[01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:11.240]  doesn't end there I mean they they try to extinguish our creativity in the
[01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:14.680]  schooling system but there's always a spark that can be reignited when people
[01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:18.840]  come into contact I agree but people love their ignorance it's a shield for
[01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:22.080]  them well it's become a trophy it's become something that people are kind of
[01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:25.380]  proud of so if they can know that well that's the new trendiness that being
[01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:29.880]  lazy and not being informed is like a shield well and as you brought up on
[01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:33.760]  your show many times that's learned that was just given out exactly and you
[01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:37.040]  talked about the food right everybody's malnourished at this point you know the
[01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:41.600]  food is horrible they're overworked they're they're in debt they're you
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:45.600]  know the everything that they see you know in media is you know the predictor
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:48.760]  programming is all dystopic you know I am by the time they get home they're
[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:52.640]  exhausted they don't they don't do the research you know it's it's a it's a
[01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:55.640]  dynamic effect that's just dragging their their entire content because people
[01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:59.080]  don't say conspiracy theorists now they go what am I gonna do right and what
[01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:03.480]  you're gonna do is start living better start being happy start go go paint a
[01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:07.680]  painting be nice to your family but also speak out when you see kids buying
[01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:11.280]  gun that has aspartame go hey you know that aspartame will brain damage you
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:15.920]  here's a card with some info on it yeah it's all it takes that act of fighting
[01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:20.080]  back if we all do little stuff it's game over folks if everybody gets this film
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:24.800]  and has a party and shows it to ten friends game over if you get my
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:28.640]  magazine and get the ten free bumper stickers that are in it game over it's
[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:32.960]  all about resistance is victory and I don't think it's ever gonna be just the
[01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:36.160]  the damn breaks and it all just happens I think it's gonna be a slow drip drip
[01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:39.320]  drip of just getting everything out there you know I've talked to a lot of top
[01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:43.040]  Hollywood people they say look most of us are awake to this it's the old higher
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:46.520]  ups that want to keep us on the reservation we don't like it even the
[01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:50.240]  rich and powerful realize their slaves and don't want to be part of this it is
[01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:55.120]  alluring to really be free it is alluring to have the real fire of
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:59.000]  Prometheus not the false fire of the Illuminati where they claim they're
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.520]  illuminating you they're not illuminating anything you're not
[01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:04.640]  illuminated if you have knowledge and then try to keep others away from it
[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:08.760]  right so that's the whole idea the the word education and the Johnson's
[01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:12.760]  dictionary of 1828 said it's the unacculting the unhiding of information
[01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:16.320]  and very much what our education system focuses on today is selectively
[01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:19.680]  presenting you with declarative sentences which is not a form of learning
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:22.920]  and what you come out with thinking is knowledge is actually our education
[01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:27.560]  system is a cult right and that doesn't mean witches around pots folks a cult
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:30.760]  means hidden they are hiding the world from you and that's the nature of power
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:34.280]  that's the power gap information I hate the occult gap they're all the same I
[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:37.680]  declare war on the occult well then we're educators and we're teachers then
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:43.040]  right exactly the thrill of empowering people is what it's all about not not
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:47.120]  the again they call it eugenics but that's a cult it's not getting rid of
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:52.680]  the dumb building up the smart it's targeting the smart again the definition
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:56.760]  of eugenics is a cult because it's a lying definition well it's a war on the
[01:54:56.760 --> 01:55:00.040]  weakest because they go after our children first they in the schooling system is
[01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:03.240]  definitely not there to educate children and make them autonomous individuals
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:06.680]  who can be self-responsible adults who is based on the pressure and system right
[01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:10.720]  which was you it's general Zod have you seen man of steel no you know I mean it's
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:15.200]  a totally anti-illuminati anti eugenics film and again how could you get the guys
[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:18.760]  that put out the dark night the last one I said it's French Revolution and then
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:21.880]  later I saw an interview after came out they go oh Bain's French Revolution we
[01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:25.400]  spent a year designing his coat I mean I could see it and tell us French
[01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:28.600]  Revolution fake Illuminati Revolution well then why would they put out
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:32.760]  Superman that's anti eugenics I think sometimes it's like to measure people's
[01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:36.200]  reactions to see how they respond to it I mean you know some of the terrorist
[01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:38.960]  events that have happened in this history I think are just a measure how
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:41.400]  what's the Patriot response to this is anyone going to pick up on the
[01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:45.240]  contradiction in the evidence or is it or is no one home is no one reviewing
[01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:49.720]  the evidence and so I think as they try to assert control more and more steadily
[01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:54.680]  and readily over humanity people react in different ways and they keep gauging
[01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:58.760]  it they're waiting they want to see everyone wake up that's their worst
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:01.760]  fear they keep thinking about it they keep talking about it and they know
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:04.000]  what's going to happen sooner or later that people are going to get it and
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.120]  that's what we're talking about the analogy of trying to hold the ball
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:09.800]  underwater it as we're inflating it they're having to hold harder and
[01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:13.320]  harder to keep it underwater it's natural state is to be above water to be
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:16.800]  free you know and they have they're struggling now to keep it keep it in
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:19.360]  our control and that's unbelievable let's go to one more clip before I take a
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:22.560]  few calls here and I appreciate people holding this is on education from the
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:27.440]  film state of mind exclusively available in info wars store.com it's clip
[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:31.440]  number five and then we'll play clip number seven after that so here's a clip
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:39.360]  number five and then we'll take some phone calls. Our children are going to get
[01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:45.720]  has nothing to do with education it is training our children to be resources
[01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:51.080]  human resources that's the way they refer to us to spin off profits for the
[01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:56.040]  globalists. The greatest barrier to discovery is not ignorance it's the
[01:56:56.040 --> 01:56:59.600]  illusion of knowledge and that's what the 15,000 hours in compulsory schooling
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:03.920]  really in in trains and conditions into us is that you've been told this story
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:07.600]  of the people in South America and so you think you know about it and it's not
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:11.040]  until later in life when you might come across more information about conquistadors
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:14.720]  and how Jesuits infiltrated all their religious systems and and took all the
[01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:18.440]  riches out and basically harvested this whole area and this is the example of
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:22.360]  plunder in South America that went on for hundreds of years so until you have
[01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:26.120]  this other piece of information to bring this into focus you think that what
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:29.160]  you're taught in public schooling during that 15,000 hours is really what's
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:33.040]  going on and it's not until you pump up to against reality as George Orwell said
[01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:36.880]  usually on a battlefield that you have to consider that which you were taught
[01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:43.480]  to believe versus the objective evidence that exists. John Taylor Gatto was an
[01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:48.000]  award-winning educator in New York who took kids that couldn't even read or
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:54.840]  write or headed for prison and made them top-level students and then he
[01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:59.200]  discovered that he was shut down by the big tax-free foundations so that he

[02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:46.120]  Google you want to know about this via Michael Moore who got mad about this
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:50.400]  video I mean just he actually responded to it and then it's been removed the
[02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:54.120]  person's had their accounts suspended this is outrageous and they're now
[02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:58.000]  censoring our videos at a record level they're very upset about this broadcast
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:02.120]  okay and everything we're doing so just understand it's not enough that we're
[02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:05.600]  doing this broadcast you need to get all this info out Brandon in California

[02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:18.760]  long-time listener Alex I know sometimes when you have people thank you for the
[02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:22.360]  things that you do you you kind of react with they don't thank me but my theory
[02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:25.680]  with that is it's actually people's way of expressing that you're a hero to them
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:29.680]  and they really just don't make that connection you know we look at it the
[02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:35.280]  solidarity you guys are heroes to me sitting on hold while I perseverate
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:40.720]  and I love your vocabulary too I'm actually going to be a high school
[02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:44.040]  English teacher and I'm going to make sure that the assignments the kids are
[02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:49.760]  given are designed to make them think that's one thing I found this system is
[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:53.640]  so centralized you can basically do whatever you want and then they'll never
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:57.920]  stop you I just tell teachers just just sabotage the enemy explain to the kids
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:00.800]  about the New World Order and just that's why they want to put cameras in
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:04.960]  there and robots in there go ahead sir sorry it's right you still got to be
[02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:08.080]  careful but I also wanted to say I'm I'm the creator of the largest private group
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:12.080]  on planet and fours on on planet and fours I'm known as free mind I'm the
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:16.440]  creator of the panopticon oh good job and some of the most wonderful
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:20.360]  information about the technology that's been created in our world is available in
[02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:26.080]  that group and we do accept anyone who comes in but it is by request only and
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:30.920]  also the creator of the LDS the Latter-day Saints for Freedom group on
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:35.600]  there as well and there's a video that just recently got posted by one of our
[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:40.080]  presidents Ezra Tass Benson who's a huge proponent of the Constitution and was
[02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:45.360]  warning about all of this stuff in the 50s and he actually told the members of
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:49.600]  the LDS church that they needed to read none dare call it conspiracy and
[02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:55.080]  consider it equal to scripture and when I heard that my my heart just went
[02:02:55.080 --> 02:02:59.160]  through the roof because I'm like dude that's the book that woke Alex up so
[02:02:59.160 --> 02:03:04.160]  basically just also wanted to tell you Alex that my wife and mother-in-law are
[02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:07.720]  just think you're the manliest man in the world now please knock it off no
[02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:13.440]  bless you you're a manly man and there's not a whole lot of them in the
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:16.480]  world man and I think that's one of the reasons why people look up to you so
[02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:20.580]  much is because you're you've got well for lack of a better firm you've got a
[02:03:20.580 --> 02:03:25.080]  pair well thank you sir I appreciate it here's what happens I mean if I find a
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:28.040]  raccoon in my garage and I try to go over and kick it in the face it's gonna
[02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:31.680]  attack me so I don't know I mean I don't think it's manly if I'm being
[02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:35.760]  attacked to stand up it's natural to resist it's unnatural to just let this
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:39.760]  all go go on and not be outraged and focus your energy to do something
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:43.280]  positive I have psychoanalyzed why I don't like being thanked I don't feel
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:47.120]  like I do enough and I almost feel guilty for the for the little bit of
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:51.280]  notoriety I've gotten fighting this because that's not what I want I want to
[02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:56.680]  end this I mean if we magically turned all this around I'd be gone well and you
[02:03:56.680 --> 02:03:59.000]  feel like that because there's always so much more to be done no matter how much
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:02.680]  you get done in any given day there's it's still out there not enough people
[02:04:02.680 --> 02:04:06.040]  are aware and back in the revolutionary times only a very small part of the
[02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:09.480]  population was informed about what was going on enough to take action and we
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:13.000]  don't need a hundred percent of America to get what's going on but if we had
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:16.720]  10% that really understood what was going on and didn't comply and it
[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:20.440]  communicate to other other percentages then we could do something successfully
[02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:24.840]  well in the color the color says it works in education the state of mind I
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:28.880]  think is a film that you could show to other educators and give them that some
[02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:32.640]  of the origins of of our current education system exactly reach out to
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:40.800]  leaders pastors rabbis imams business owners teachers doctors police that's
[02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:44.760]  what they're scared of gentlemen you are going to be interviewed for the old

[02:08:18.520 --> 02:08:26.920]  well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones you know
[02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:32.440]  we're on YouTube because that's where the battle for the general public is more
[02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:37.520]  than half the world's free video views according to business insider and other
[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:42.080]  publications on numbers that have been released are on YouTube so people say
[02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:46.280]  well it's their own private side it's free market they don't like it they should
[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:50.480]  be able to ban you know the terms of service is that it's a public commons
[02:08:50.480 --> 02:08:57.920]  you tube you you and me you and I and as long as you follow their rules you
[02:08:57.920 --> 02:09:06.040]  should be able to be there but if ABC CBS NBC Fox CNN BBC show the collateral
[02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:09.360]  damage video where they shoot up the Reuters vehicle and the little kids it's
[02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:12.120]  just black and white you can't even really see their bodies they're allowed
[02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:17.520]  to show that the newscast we show it they banned our account I had to have
[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:21.960]  lawyers send them letters everything else and they backed off but most people
[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:25.560]  don't have the time and energy to do that I had to swear out an affidavit in
[02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:31.240]  federal court just to keep the channel we've got that's got 300 something
[02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:35.440]  million views and then on that channel it was 300 million views they turned it
[02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:39.600]  back to 270 million views and then I mean it's all sorts of weirdness and now
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:45.360]  with World War Z review I did about how it's a bunch of pro UN anti you know gun
[02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:50.200]  owner garbage in the book which the film is like the first few chapters of the
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:54.920]  book so they're gonna do a sequel with it but but but the first few chapters are
[02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:58.640]  true to what basically happens in the film I've seen it and another review of
[02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:02.280]  that man of steel versus versus World War Z and people say well why do you
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:06.640]  cover films well we cover them because then that's pop culture we reach out to
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:10.360]  people that aren't into politics that's how we get new people who aren't just in
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:17.360]  the choir or in the Church of Liberty but all over the place I have seen videos
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:22.440]  that go viral that get a half million million two million views and YouTube
[02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:27.880]  will delete them or YouTube will say parental your reasons and block them
[02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:32.400]  Mike Adams put out a very funny TSA one that just had him joking around about
[02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:36.280]  it's super awesome to stick our hands down your pants you know we're totally
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:43.120]  losers but it was South Park Ian and funny it was going viral they blend the
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:48.720]  they banned the video they blocked it so this is the type of stuff that goes on
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:52.960]  they really hate humor and we've had over 500 entries and we're going through
[02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:57.120]  the last of them it's the best of times worst of times for the Paul Revere
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:00.200]  contest and David Knight's been on showing a lot of that we commending for
[02:11:00.200 --> 02:11:05.160]  that info works nightly news reporter guest host here on the broadcast doing a
[02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:10.240]  great job and telly Leatherface Blackwood is a retired well-known
[02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:15.160]  professional wrestler comedian and he has a great YouTube cider had one with
[02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:20.200]  nine million plus views he did a Paul Revere entry where George Washington
[02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:25.400]  comes back and basically gets in the face of Michael Moore and others it's
[02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:30.440]  total satire it's not violent it's a joke it's got cartoonish waterboarding that
[02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:35.000]  they have in real cartoons you know mainline TV everywhere and they banned it
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:39.600]  and you can still see it on another video site which is why we always say do
[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:44.320]  your entry on YouTube but also on another platform because we know how they
[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:48.680]  operate but here's the issue they banned his Google account his email everything
[02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:51.920]  else this is their plan they've said where they're going to take down
[02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:57.720]  everything on the web their plan is you'll have an internet ID with a thumb
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:01.480]  print or face can to access and you'll just suddenly not be able to buy or
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:05.880]  sell this is the cashless society and they're going to rack up fines and fees
[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:10.400]  and everything to use the internet so it's a corporate global above the law
[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:14.400]  group like Facebook part of Bilderberg saying they own everything you've ever
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:19.840]  done on it retroactively so this is the big combines are trying to take over and
[02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:24.040]  get rid of the old web and cybersecurity has been built on record to help
[02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:28.200]  them kill the real web now that's what they've actually said we've written
[02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:32.800]  articles on this this isn't rhetoric this is what they say they're going to do
[02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:36.520]  okay just like we told you a decade ago they're watching you over on board
[02:12:36.520 --> 02:12:41.640]  audio and and video on the computers now that's all admitted it was admitted
[02:12:41.640 --> 02:12:44.720]  then I had the patents of them admitting it it wasn't my opinion but people
[02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:49.240]  weren't ready to believe it okay but I'm telling you folks this is their plan to
[02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:52.400]  kill the free web as we know it that's why Google acts like they're defending
[02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:55.840]  the free web because they're taking it over themselves David Knight I want to
[02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:59.520]  go to Telly Blackwood who was censored here and then we can get some attention
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:04.400]  he started a new channel but they make you get a Google email now to have an
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:08.240]  account they made all us do that here which is a monopoly and they won't even
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:12.200]  talk to him about the issue I mean he's got this cryptic message that just says
[02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:16.720]  the account has been terminated due to a legal complaint he tried to contact
[02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:20.840]  them he couldn't talk to them because he didn't have a Google no judge no jury
[02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:24.520]  it's just it's just somebody complained off of your head and you see this
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:27.920]  happening you know CISPA they came up right the whole idea about that was that
[02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:31.000]  they could file and they've come at this a number of ways you know first they
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:35.080]  were coming at it from a with a SOPA some these other with a copyright
[02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:38.760]  violations where they can just take your entire website down immediately but one
[02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:44.560]  element of CISPA was to protect these these private companies like Google that
[02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:48.560]  are turning over your information as a third party they just voluntarily turn
[02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:51.200]  it over to the government the government maintains that they don't need to have a
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:53.640]  search warrant if they get the information voluntarily from the third
[02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:58.480]  party so CISPA was set up to protect them from any legal liability for
[02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:03.080]  violating their user agreements that was a key element of CISPA they can come in
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:08.080]  and act capriciously arbitrarily and as you pointed out they can treat you
[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:12.200]  differently than they treat the major news media take take your website down
[02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:16.760]  because of a video that you put up that they allow other news organizations to
[02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:23.880]  put up it's amazing though that satire is completely protected I mean it's like
[02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:29.240]  13 years in jail for chalk in LA water soluble and the judge says you will not
[02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:32.840]  bring up first amendment arguments telling someone you have no bill of
[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:37.720]  rights that is that is a serious crime you can look that up a judge saying your
[02:14:37.720 --> 02:14:41.840]  bill of rights is not admissible he's sworn an oath to that right right and
[02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:47.000]  satire is as you said is very explicitly protected with fair use why do
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:50.360]  you think they why do you think they ban
[02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:54.240]  comedies what they're really scared of sorry go ahead well I think they like it
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:57.920]  when people are afraid you know we talk about what's happening with Snowden and
[02:14:57.920 --> 02:15:02.520]  the NSA and that sort of thing it's it's people have to know that we're not
[02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:06.400]  trying to make people afraid we're trying to get them to be aware of what's
[02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:10.360]  going on to wake up to get angry enough to do something about it they're hoping
[02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:13.520]  that you're going to be afraid they're hoping you're going to be intimidated so
[02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:17.320]  they're okay when information comes out that intimidates and scares some of the
[02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:21.200]  public but they're not okay about it when you make fun of them when you point
[02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:24.160]  out the emperor has no clothes that's not something that they would that they
[02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:28.360]  want to have go out well that's what I was basically you know getting at is
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:33.280]  that I come at this because I'm angry that we're being enslaved and I don't
[02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:36.880]  have fear I have fear of letting them win and I know that sometimes I actually
[02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:40.480]  scare people that's not my goal right people should be scared of not getting
[02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:47.320]  involved and standing up I want to go to telly blackwood we have the article up
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:52.080]  on info wars dot com right now that actually has the video that is censored
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:57.160]  it's film contest entrance banned from YouTube actually he's been banned from
[02:15:57.160 --> 02:16:01.680]  Google platforms blacklisted and harassed by stranger I would just change it to
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:07.160]  say you know you know banned from anonymous complaint but the point is
[02:16:07.160 --> 02:16:12.600]  this is going on in the band videos there telly tell us what you think of
[02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:22.560]  this yeah he's lost our skype audio telly can you hear me there bud we do an
[02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:27.280]  audio test with you earlier in the night okay fantastic again why do you think
[02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:35.480]  this happened to you I was probably getting the word out very well where
[02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:39.360]  else there's a couple actors and show host that ticket personal a little too
[02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:43.200]  much that's right Michael Moore actually had been responding publicly to this
[02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:49.200]  video yeah one little response a quick one with a little profane in it and now
[02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:56.640]  it's pretty much the end of it and that was on his Facebook right yes and so
[02:16:56.640 --> 02:17:01.560]  now Michael Moore doesn't like it so you don't have free speech it's if that's
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:06.360]  the reason one thing I was always suspicious is I was in process of
[02:17:06.360 --> 02:17:10.600]  emailing info wars a couple whistleblowers that came to me you know
[02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:16.800]  seeking you guys and it was within after one hour after sending those emails was
[02:17:16.800 --> 02:17:21.920]  I blocked out of my Gmail by morning is when I started getting the weird little
[02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:27.240]  text and phone calls and I realized I still couldn't get into my Gmail but
[02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:32.520]  they did send you a YouTube notice that it was due to a legal complaint a
[02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:38.480]  secret legal complaint well I had to have actually send them a message from
[02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:42.240]  another Gmail account and just try to get the information out of them for it
[02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:46.160]  but they didn't tell you that that's why that happened yeah yeah well what you
[02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:48.920]  want to give them what you give me an alternate email address they'll send you
[02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:53.200]  that little notice that I sent the screenshot of and that's that's it they
[02:17:53.200 --> 02:17:57.800]  didn't even notify you though you just kind of found out by looking at it that
[02:17:57.800 --> 02:18:01.520]  it was gone right yeah it was just all of a sudden gone
[02:18:01.520 --> 02:18:05.920]  that wasn't you what's unusual was usually if there's a music violation or
[02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:10.560]  any copyright issues usually a little actually nuclear video or they'll block
[02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:14.280]  your audio out then when you log into your dashboard you'll actually get
[02:18:14.280 --> 02:18:19.240]  options they'll actually let you know what's going on yeah according to their rules in
[02:18:19.240 --> 02:18:24.040]  the public commons you get to challenge things but no here just boom your
[02:18:24.040 --> 02:18:27.840]  Gmail accounts gone everything this is this is what the because oh the
[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:33.280]  almighty great man the self-propelled job of the hut is probably the one that
[02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:37.520]  complained and when the royalty when when his royal highness you know wants
[02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:41.160]  something banned from the internet it's gone and they don't say anything about
[02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:45.640]  copyright and the message to you they just say a legal complaint and it wasn't
[02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:49.000]  anything in there that would have been a copyright violation maybe I can do a
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:53.520]  legal complaint and just come take your house David how about your life I can
[02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:58.560]  plan to execute yeah how's that some yeah in DAA if the president wants to
[02:18:58.560 --> 02:19:02.560]  kill US citizens he can what's wrong with making him emperor I mean Hitler could
[02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:07.440]  kill whoever he wanted why can't Obama that's right telly you're now a very
[02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:11.360]  serious thought criminal the video is still available on Vimo we have it or
[02:19:11.360 --> 02:19:15.680]  Vimeo on info wars.com do you think other thought criminals should go out
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:19.000]  there and protest by getting your video out to people that had half a million
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:23.520]  views I think they were scared at how fast your video is growing yeah the
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:26.960]  faster was growing and the fact that I actually managed to get myself into a
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:31.400]  local press the second one will be which gets indicated nationwide through a
[02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:36.120]  bunch of different internet sites the video does travel this beyond us to be
[02:19:36.120 --> 02:19:39.880]  used the views was a nice thing but they're reached with my articles and
[02:19:39.880 --> 02:19:44.440]  other publicity I got off of the video so let's be clear you you did a video the
[02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:47.440]  reason we did a contest was the first amendment to get the word out about
[02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:52.120]  George Washington job with a hut didn't like it and so and it was in the news so
[02:19:52.120 --> 02:19:55.840]  now your video is gone and your civil rights have been violated and the video
[02:19:55.840 --> 02:19:59.040]  clearly doesn't violate their terms of use we'll be right back as part of the

[02:24:31.160 --> 02:24:35.800]  about a joke video against Michael Moore where George Washington's angry at
[02:24:35.800 --> 02:24:39.720]  him and Michael Moore on his Facebook well I mean you've got a copy of it right

[02:24:54.280 --> 02:24:57.400]  it's one of Michael Moore's people he came back and said oh you think that's
[02:24:57.400 --> 02:25:01.480]  real funny there a holes coming what from what looks like a group of juvenile
[02:25:01.480 --> 02:25:05.680]  delinquents and your conservatives very interesting that was his comment yeah

[02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:47.560]  anything until after the trial they haven't had the trial they haven't
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:52.040]  convicted of anything but they just deleted all the data last week so it's

[02:33:18.720 --> 02:33:23.280]  it he's also been a national wrestler and we're gonna be talking to Matt Dubie
[02:33:23.280 --> 02:33:26.880]  I'll hear in a minute about his little visit with FEMA and more he's under
[02:33:26.880 --> 02:33:34.520]  visiting us from 1530 WCKG.com up in Chicago he's a general manager up there
[02:33:34.520 --> 02:33:38.840]  we're honored to have him with us but I've been ranting here it's just so
[02:33:38.840 --> 02:33:43.520]  clear that Michael Moore gets upset publicly comments about this video part
[02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:49.520]  of the MFallWars.com film Paul Revere contest and then it gets in the
[02:33:49.520 --> 02:33:55.320]  Sacramento B it gets in a bunch of other newspapers the video you know every day
[02:33:55.320 --> 02:33:57.640]  getting hundreds of thousands of views they could see this was gonna get
[02:33:57.640 --> 02:34:01.480]  millions it had a half a million when they are more when they killed I think
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:06.760]  was like 600 something thousand and then they just kill the video in fact the
[02:34:06.760 --> 02:34:10.200]  last time you looked at it telly blackwood the maker of the film and
[02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:16.760]  who plays job of the hut in it how many views did it have when they killed it I
[02:34:16.760 --> 02:34:24.000]  believe it had a 533,000 K last time I looked at it yesterday morning it's been
[02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:28.600]  locked up for a couple days so I'm sure the numbers were about to flip as soon
[02:34:28.600 --> 02:34:32.840]  as it happened so look look I believe it was Michael Moore probably or not it
[02:34:32.840 --> 02:34:37.800]  was it was the Redcoat Pierce Morgan so so I guess they don't just dislike the
[02:34:37.800 --> 02:34:44.280]  second amendment here yeah I don't like the first as well obviously absolutely
[02:34:44.280 --> 02:34:46.680]  so they don't like the second they don't like the first as well I think I said
[02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:51.320]  that backwards so tell me what do you think's going on here I think it's just
[02:34:51.320 --> 02:34:56.880]  another meaningless censorship with all the whistleblowers coming out and
[02:34:56.880 --> 02:35:01.720]  people exercising their rights and speaking out and waking up like you
[02:35:01.720 --> 02:35:07.320]  said before you want a comedy well after travels and comedy travels so I used
[02:35:07.320 --> 02:35:10.720]  that to go ahead and bring people in and slap the truth on them so as they were
[02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:15.160]  done laughing I think this is gonna backfire I would contact the local
[02:35:15.160 --> 02:35:19.480]  paper and others and point out now that your video got removed so they can
[02:35:19.480 --> 02:35:26.120]  contact the YouTube people and ask why they're doing this and find out who
[02:35:26.120 --> 02:35:32.080]  made this legal complaint because if they can shut down anybody's work and
[02:35:32.080 --> 02:35:37.280]  part of their livelihood then they could do this to anybody you know they got me
[02:35:37.280 --> 02:35:40.360]  into loop-to-loop around when I was trying to get into that the Gmail for
[02:35:40.360 --> 02:35:45.640]  access and recovered YouTube's or try to see what was going on they did try to
[02:35:45.640 --> 02:35:53.320]  block me on all that pretty much the more worrisome thing is is not having no
[02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:58.680]  due process or no chance to even explain myself or see who's doing water where
[02:35:58.680 --> 02:36:02.160]  because a lot of people hate and dislike your videos and I've heard before
[02:36:02.160 --> 02:36:06.960]  people flagging your video a couple times and your videos gone or something
[02:36:06.960 --> 02:36:11.680]  happens but I mean just come here and say all we got a complaint you know
[02:36:11.680 --> 02:36:17.680]  goodbye you're gone and without no notice or explanation is ridiculous well
[02:36:17.680 --> 02:36:21.080]  that shows that they thought it was pretty important whoever threatened them
[02:36:21.080 --> 02:36:25.320]  and the way he acts with his bodyguards with all their firearms and
[02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:29.520]  everything I mean this guy is really a monster and I'm glad you point out the
[02:36:29.520 --> 02:36:34.360]  hypocrisy of the fact that he has armed bodyguards six of them but he doesn't
[02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:37.480]  want you to be able to have a gun to protect yourself he says get a dog
[02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:44.120]  telly is that he is a dog and two I don't see all dogs I'm sorry go ahead
[02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:48.800]  I'm sorry dogs but I don't see why he needs bodyguards anyway I mean Lady
[02:36:48.800 --> 02:36:53.120]  Gaga or Madonna or someone like that yeah but if I see him on the street I
[02:36:53.120 --> 02:36:59.000]  wouldn't want his autograph or get near his little pudgy face anyway so I tell
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:03.880]  you what would you like to say to man bear pig I mean I don't know that's
[02:37:03.880 --> 02:37:08.360]  Al Gore what would you like to say to the anti-first amendment anti-second
[02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:14.360]  amendment creature I would say you are living in the wrong country that you
[02:37:14.360 --> 02:37:18.360]  know you're older little globalist pals including peers need to all hop on a
[02:37:18.360 --> 02:37:23.320]  little ship and sell off somewhere I won't say where but you know that they
[02:37:23.320 --> 02:37:26.760]  say that's why he's so obese though he supports the you in population reduction
[02:37:26.760 --> 02:37:30.160]  programs is just from going to third world countries and eating children I'm
[02:37:30.160 --> 02:37:42.960]  joking folks he doesn't actually eat children but seriously I mean I'm
[02:37:42.960 --> 02:37:45.480]  surprised you're not even more angry I'm making a joke out of it they took
[02:37:45.480 --> 02:37:51.400]  your site with over over nine million views yeah yeah I'm very angry my main
[02:37:51.400 --> 02:37:56.800]  angry point was the first half hour to hour of making the discovery I've been
[02:37:56.800 --> 02:38:00.440]  up all night pretty angry and do everything I can and try to figure out
[02:38:00.440 --> 02:38:05.320]  you're supposed to get three strikes but they just they violated their own
[02:38:05.320 --> 02:38:10.240]  policy no and you know my material over the years it was a little edgy and I've
[02:38:10.240 --> 02:38:13.200]  gotten warnings before but my account I've been a YouTube partner for a long
[02:38:13.200 --> 02:38:17.840]  time my account has been clear for anything for forever and I mean but
[02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:20.640]  like I said when you get violations they just either take your video down
[02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:24.600]  send you a little message in your dashboard or you're messing up and you
[02:38:24.600 --> 02:38:30.520]  can protest you can you know you know contested it or whatever sometimes you
[02:38:30.520 --> 02:38:33.920]  can't and you say okay and agree then you move on you know I think everybody
[02:38:33.920 --> 02:38:41.080]  should recreate your video and and or like waterboard a cat box and say it's
[02:38:41.080 --> 02:38:47.520]  say it's it's it's it's him or just just everything because if he doesn't like
[02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:53.800]  satire in America he should leave the North Korea I'll forget you very well
[02:38:53.800 --> 02:38:59.320]  there well they probably actually eat him that's it the the UN food aid
[02:38:59.320 --> 02:39:04.280]  program to North Korea he should he says there's too many people he should he
[02:39:04.280 --> 02:39:08.280]  should probably go over there and sacrifice himself so that thousands could
[02:39:08.280 --> 02:39:12.360]  eat so full of GMO and crap I don't think they would want you to manipulate oh

[02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:52.480]  the nightly news at least the reason this is a big deal folks and I make jokes
[02:41:52.480 --> 02:41:57.240]  about it's actually deadly serious is that Mike Adams did a very tame but
[02:41:57.240 --> 02:42:01.480]  also funny thing about the TSA saying they were losers and they took that down
[02:42:01.480 --> 02:42:05.480]  and then we put it up and they took it down and then we put it up again and
[02:42:05.480 --> 02:42:10.480]  then they blocked it I mean these are authoritarians prancing around saying
[02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:14.960]  they're liberals they're the opposite of liberals I were joined by Matt Dubiel a
[02:42:14.960 --> 02:42:18.880]  good friend of mine is the vice president general manager of WCKG radio in
[02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:23.000]  Chicago he's a broadcast and new media expert who's worked with the celebrities
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:26.840]  across the board I'm gonna get into all of it here from Donnie Osmond been
[02:42:26.840 --> 02:42:32.120]  featured in a fast company a magazine and Chicago magazine most recently he's
[02:42:32.120 --> 02:42:36.040]  made national headlines on Drudge and Fox and Friends Inside Edition CNN for the
[02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:39.880]  criticism over the TSA screening of his three-year-old son on a family trip to
[02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:45.480]  Disneyland who's disabled special needs and again his WCKG carries the
[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:52.320]  Alex Jones show the afternoon drive 1 to 4 on WCKG we're on right now 1530 WCKG
[02:42:52.320 --> 02:42:57.480]  dot com and Matt Dubiel dot com Matt number one thanks for having us on the
[02:42:57.480 --> 02:43:01.200]  Chicago thanks for all you do I want to get into FEMA Corps visiting your house
[02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:06.600]  but first off your latest viral video what do you make of telly blackwood can
[02:43:06.600 --> 02:43:11.520]  even have his his tame video up there making jokes because somebody doesn't
[02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:16.760]  like it I think I would love to see him in a cage match with Michael Moore you
[02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:20.960]  know where's Vince McMahon let's get it happening let's do it now and let's
[02:43:20.960 --> 02:43:25.120]  let's see him really take it to the mad you know I think the reason or the
[02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:29.880]  symptom of this is highlights the importance of two things AM radio and
[02:43:29.880 --> 02:43:34.520]  your magazine the internet's great your website's great all the things that you
[02:43:34.520 --> 02:43:38.400]  do online are great but they could be shut down like that and what happens if
[02:43:38.400 --> 02:43:42.240]  they're shut down what happens if the IP is are scrambled from the domains and
[02:43:42.240 --> 02:43:45.800]  all of a sudden what happens if somebody can't go to info wars calm and it
[02:43:45.800 --> 02:43:49.920]  doesn't go to the right place what happens if Google shuts you down you are
[02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:53.400]  so powerful and this message is so powerful because of these tools on the
[02:43:53.400 --> 02:43:59.480]  internet but this if I get this in my home if that gets shut down I still
[02:43:59.480 --> 02:44:02.920]  have this I still have a conduit my power was out the other day you're
[02:44:02.920 --> 02:44:06.920]  talking about info wars magazine info wars magazine yes info wars magazine or
[02:44:06.920 --> 02:44:10.480]  AM radio shows I know you're on the FM no no no no no then Austin that's why
[02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:15.440]  man and AM that's why you're right we need to keep old media more than ever
[02:44:15.440 --> 02:44:19.520]  yeah and it's in its flawed and and there are problems with it and yes it's
[02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:22.800]  going away and yes the future is digital but it's real diversity we need to keep
[02:44:22.800 --> 02:44:26.680]  it what happens when they shut down your Facebook what happens when they shut
[02:44:26.680 --> 02:44:31.320]  down and and so what happens to the old local real journalist once those AM and
[02:44:31.320 --> 02:44:36.800]  FM stations are gone again it's not making places for diversity in real
[02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:40.440]  media but I'm remind there was a movie it might have been in the 90s or the
[02:44:40.440 --> 02:44:44.560]  early 2000s enemy of the state with Will Smith where they shut off his credit
[02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:49.680]  totally should be happy that today they're attacking his Twitter and today
[02:44:49.680 --> 02:44:55.480]  his Google's being attacked what if he wasn't didn't exist that's how he feels
[02:44:55.480 --> 02:44:59.040]  right now his voice is shut up and it's happening to him because he spoke out
[02:44:59.040 --> 02:45:03.880]  but what happens to the regular folks all of a sudden when they can't buy or
[02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:08.520]  sell or do business or they're shut off because of the internet because some
[02:45:08.520 --> 02:45:13.080]  arbitrary company or conglomerate has control that's happening to him and it's
[02:45:13.080 --> 02:45:16.600]  going to happen to me and you and others at some point the best thing they can do
[02:45:16.600 --> 02:45:19.960]  is duplicate that video over and over again like you said have other accounts
[02:45:19.960 --> 02:45:24.720]  duplicated and I'll tell you what I like is how man cowl has gone back and done a
[02:45:24.720 --> 02:45:30.360]  daily TV show that's now getting really high ratings simulcasting the radio show
[02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:35.560]  that you carry in Chicago and now he's doing a show on history but the point
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:39.680]  is he's doing a bunch of stuff that's what you've got to do is use the old
[02:45:39.680 --> 02:45:44.960]  media because if you go to old UHF VHF TV and put a good show on people will go
[02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:49.440]  tune into it that's one reason old media has been in trouble is because they
[02:45:49.440 --> 02:45:54.160]  they're going with the establishment model the only thing that sells in AM and
[02:45:54.160 --> 02:45:58.880]  FM is liberty well yeah regular television you got Judge Mathis on on
[02:45:58.880 --> 02:46:03.360]  UHF and VHF and that is the old model I just put an intent on my house to get
[02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:07.520]  HD because all the storms coming through which is why FEMA came by and my TV my
[02:46:07.520 --> 02:46:10.560]  dishes get knocked out so I thought well hell I'm gonna put an antenna up you
[02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:15.440]  know what all the antenna stations are all Chinese foreign language programming
[02:46:15.440 --> 02:46:18.720]  all Russian foreign language programming I don't know what they're
[02:46:18.720 --> 02:46:21.320]  saying but they're getting their message out and they're doing it on
[02:46:21.320 --> 02:46:24.920]  traditional television they're doing it in publications and periodicals like
[02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:29.080]  in Forrest magazine and it's a niche and there's advertising I've read the trades
[02:46:29.080 --> 02:46:32.560]  they're making a ton of money too well and and it's important if I were
[02:46:32.560 --> 02:46:36.560]  listening right now I would make sure that if there's a radio station in your
[02:46:36.560 --> 02:46:40.640]  hometown that you can get the Alex Jones show on that you know what it is so if
[02:46:40.640 --> 02:46:44.360]  you can't get it online you you got it because I'll tell you what my power went
[02:46:44.360 --> 02:46:48.400]  out the other day I went to look up phone numbers I didn't have power I didn't
[02:46:48.400 --> 02:46:52.240]  have a phone book all of a sudden we were paralyzed so imagine being cut off
[02:46:52.240 --> 02:46:55.360]  because you don't have power you don't have internet you don't have you know
[02:46:55.360 --> 02:46:58.960]  your accounts are shut down how you're gonna get this information on the regular
[02:46:58.960 --> 02:47:03.160]  radio is there is there a station near you and I'd get that magazine because
[02:47:03.160 --> 02:47:06.800]  it's sent to your house you know you're gonna get it and you at least you have a
[02:47:06.800 --> 02:47:10.440]  conduit to get to the pluses there's less and less paper people really pay
[02:47:10.440 --> 02:47:14.040]  attention to hard copy things now that's why it's important to have books DVDs
[02:47:14.040 --> 02:47:19.800]  films it's good to have an archive of this because they can now go into YouTube
[02:47:19.800 --> 02:47:24.040]  and claim Joe Rogan's voice as copyright even though he didn't authorize this and
[02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:28.040]  block everybody that ever interviewed him it wasn't didn't just happen in
[02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:31.640]  fours yeah it happened and until he went and found out who was doing it and
[02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:36.000]  and was like no no you don't own my voice you owned a recording I did but
[02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:40.320]  they had the computer set it to where it could say that his voice was owned and
[02:47:40.320 --> 02:47:45.440]  and they've done the same thing to me a company bought rights to distribute my
[02:47:45.440 --> 02:47:52.560]  film in-game in Canada a limited distributorship soon my own account other
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:48:00.800]  people's account was blocked they said they owned my voice on that tape it's
[02:48:00.800 --> 02:48:06.640]  scary it's it and when you think about it they can go through another example is
[02:48:06.640 --> 02:48:10.960]  the Kindle with 1984 they can edit history they can edit a book anybody
[02:48:10.960 --> 02:48:14.440]  can do it with a push of a button so if you have archives of regular books
[02:48:14.440 --> 02:48:18.040]  classics if you have archives of periodicals that you like and you have a
[02:48:18.040 --> 02:48:21.640]  way to get that information that's right important well last time Matt I I
[02:48:21.640 --> 02:48:28.720]  mentioned this on air college like I can still get 1984 on Kindle I think was
[02:48:28.720 --> 02:48:33.240]  60 something thousand people of what four years ago had it erased off their
[02:48:33.240 --> 02:48:37.240]  thing by design there was a backlash so they put it back on yeah but the point
[02:48:37.240 --> 02:48:40.800]  is there needs to be a backlash each time they brag that they hope that we just
[02:48:40.800 --> 02:48:45.360]  get used to being censored and finally just give up no we've got to fight well
[02:48:45.360 --> 02:48:48.080]  what happens when they change the words if they can go and find everything with
[02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:51.880]  Joe Rogan's voice on it they can go in and take a word they don't like you
[02:48:51.880 --> 02:48:54.680]  mentioned some words earlier all of a sudden oh well we don't like this word
[02:48:54.680 --> 02:48:58.640]  homosexual okay everything take you take that word out and you replace it with
[02:48:58.640 --> 02:49:01.640]  something else all of a sudden history's they're trying to ban to kill a
[02:49:01.640 --> 02:49:05.960]  mockingbird that's total anti-racism film because it has the n-word in it I
[02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:09.280]  mean I mean are they gonna ban the godfather because it has it in there
[02:49:09.280 --> 02:49:13.840]  they're showing racism it's not it's showing it in the context yes Alex as
[02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:17.640]  an Italian-American wearing a pinstripe suit from Chicago I'm offended by the
[02:49:17.640 --> 02:49:21.040]  godfather I demand they take all references to Italians that are
[02:49:21.040 --> 02:49:26.600]  derogatory out immediately by the way I like the pinstripe suit thanks oh man I
[02:49:26.600 --> 02:49:31.480]  tell you so Howard listeners like on the show now up in Chicago you know they

[02:53:02.760 --> 02:53:07.520]  symptoms for nearly two years I suffered severe hot flashes which prevented me
[02:53:07.520 --> 02:53:11.920]  from sleeping all night it was so hard to work because it continued all day to
[02:53:11.920 --> 02:53:16.720]  have the hot flashes from hell I was exhausted and depleted after only three
[02:53:16.720 --> 02:53:20.880]  weeks on one world way I have no hot flashes and I'm sleeping normally again
[02:53:20.880 --> 02:53:25.720]  I feel energized and strong this is an amazing product it is a little known
[02:53:25.720 --> 02:53:29.240]  fact that every single cell of your body is supposed to produce 10% of its
[02:53:29.240 --> 02:53:34.560]  protein content as glutathione but due to toxicity and aging it does not could
[02:53:34.560 --> 02:53:38.040]  glutathione be a missing factor in optimal cell function for your entire
[02:53:38.040 --> 02:53:41.400]  body if you restore the optimal glutathione levels in your cells
[02:53:41.400 --> 02:53:45.240]  especially your glands and organs then as a result your glands and organs work
[02:53:45.240 --> 02:53:49.280]  better imagine the quality of life improvement you might have to order one

[02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:22.160]  Matt Dubiel is our guest a little bit of overdrive with him as well
[02:54:22.160 --> 02:54:26.640]  audio streams at info wars.com and we were talking during the break about
[02:54:26.640 --> 02:54:30.800]  getting me up to Chicago as soon as I'm done with Obama Deception 2 in the fall
[02:54:30.800 --> 02:54:36.760]  I am going to because I promise to do it I am going to start probably doing one
[02:54:36.760 --> 02:54:40.520]  event every two months and I want to go to Chicago I want to go to Southern
[02:54:40.520 --> 02:54:44.120]  California I want to go to New York because we're on several affiliates that
[02:54:44.120 --> 02:54:47.800]  go into New York or like five or six affiliates in the state of New York but
[02:54:47.800 --> 02:54:51.520]  one of them has Bloomberg pulled their hair out covers New York City they can't
[02:54:51.520 --> 02:54:56.600]  stand that and I want to go to Florida I want to go back up to Dallas again
[02:54:56.600 --> 02:55:01.160]  I mean I want to do all this and I need to do it plus I want to do some events
[02:55:01.160 --> 02:55:04.120]  the problem is getting a place to do it and having it be free got to pay for the
[02:55:04.120 --> 02:55:07.680]  sound system pay for all the people I don't want to charge $500 a ticket like
[02:55:07.680 --> 02:55:10.680]  Glenn Beck's I can fly in on a private jet maybe I've been doing it wrong the
[02:55:10.680 --> 02:55:14.640]  whole time maybe that is the answer but but the whole issue is we'll have to
[02:55:14.640 --> 02:55:17.800]  end up charging something to these things 10-20 bucks because the cost of all
[02:55:17.800 --> 02:55:22.520]  this stuff is so prohibitive but I want to have some big free event somewhere
[02:55:22.520 --> 02:55:25.680]  where I mean I guarantee you if I had something in Central Park or something
[02:55:25.680 --> 02:55:29.720]  and I promoted for a few months we could get 50,000 people out and I want to show
[02:55:29.720 --> 02:55:33.280]  the media that I didn't really get any shots of the thousands of people at
[02:55:33.280 --> 02:55:37.280]  Bilderberg but the media did of me they're giving a speech there you know
[02:55:37.280 --> 02:55:42.440]  in the countryside an hour northwest of London that just shows Matt that
[02:55:42.440 --> 02:55:47.160]  that freedom is becoming popular yeah you're not nervous about any of this I
[02:55:47.160 --> 02:55:51.960]  mean when you look at the the kill list you know the Clinton kill list the
[02:55:51.960 --> 02:55:56.920]  Obama kill list all the people that have kind of disappeared the idea of leaving
[02:55:56.920 --> 02:56:01.000]  here and going around doesn't frighten you or going to Bilderberg well I don't
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:04.720]  want to give them any ideas when I go jogging to the woods by myself everybody
[02:56:04.720 --> 02:56:09.840]  knows where I go the system knows I mean I don't want to die but I'm above them
[02:56:09.840 --> 02:56:15.320]  and and I know they're doing bad and if they kill me they kill me my whole
[02:56:15.320 --> 02:56:20.280]  issue is I know I'm doing the right thing and I've done such a big body of
[02:56:20.280 --> 02:56:23.920]  work that if they kill me it'll really supercharge everything we've done I
[02:56:23.920 --> 02:56:27.960]  don't want that to happen no and I think I'll be more effective living but I
[02:56:27.960 --> 02:56:30.880]  mean this is always the big topic with everybody because they see the kill list
[02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:34.720]  they're like why are you still alive you must be an agent or something which
[02:56:34.720 --> 02:56:40.040]  well if I'm an agent we need more like it because what do you think what do you
[02:56:40.040 --> 02:56:44.800]  think I'm still alive well I yeah I don't I think you're not out much I mean
[02:56:44.800 --> 02:56:48.480]  aside from your daily life it's you're not you aren't stumping and traveling
[02:56:48.480 --> 02:56:52.320]  around the country that would for me you know if I was your your security guy
[02:56:52.320 --> 02:56:56.440]  talking into the arm piece all the time I'd be like no keep him out I don't not
[02:56:56.440 --> 02:56:59.440]  just because of yeah we have nuts that say they're gonna kill me it's it's
[02:56:59.440 --> 02:57:04.120]  nutty people it's and then it's this confrontation just a negative of you
[02:57:04.120 --> 02:57:08.080]  say something that offends one little micro group even though they agree with
[02:57:08.080 --> 02:57:11.840]  you and 99% of the other stuff you said one word that offended them and now
[02:57:11.840 --> 02:57:15.320]  they're all well they also make stuff up I mean it's freaky when people are
[02:57:15.320 --> 02:57:19.200]  saying I'm this this and that and I'm and they're really like you could tell
[02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:22.520]  they've got mental problems and they've made it all about me yeah I just can't
[02:57:22.520 --> 02:57:26.440]  live in fear of those people no it's true and and you're you're stronger man
[02:57:26.440 --> 02:57:31.160]  than I know I'm not anyways you're you put me on the radio in Chicago twice a
[02:57:31.160 --> 02:57:37.200]  day well you know what the alternative is do-op music all these classic rock
[02:57:37.200 --> 02:57:41.720]  more sports I mean you listen to the radio and there is there's nothing on
[02:57:41.720 --> 02:57:45.160]  that's why the internet is so popular that's why alternative media is so
[02:57:45.160 --> 02:57:49.600]  important if you had an event in Central Park and 50,000 people showed up you
[02:57:49.600 --> 02:57:52.280]  know they did one and they did a tea party thing in Chicago and I think
[02:57:52.280 --> 02:57:57.320]  man cow was there crickets channel two channel five channel seven channel nine
[02:57:57.320 --> 02:58:00.880]  channel three you know Fox none of them showed it or they showed it they filmed
[02:58:00.880 --> 02:58:04.240]  it in a way close it looked like three people were there but here's the deal
[02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:08.800]  now we do this we show how we have 5,000 out for a gun rally the media shows
[02:58:08.800 --> 02:58:12.320]  three people and you show this and then we show their lie that's why they're
[02:58:12.320 --> 02:58:15.440]  losing that's why they're falling apart yeah I agree because they're not running
[02:58:15.440 --> 02:58:19.400]  these scams you know where they dub in booing over Ron Paul at CPAC yeah they're
[02:58:19.400 --> 02:58:22.480]  not doing this in a vacuum and by the way if you want to sponsor the show in

[03:01:03.360 --> 03:01:19.600]  Regina in Texas who's been holding here on the air go ahead Regina we rented a
[03:01:19.600 --> 03:01:24.480]  theater and we showed freedom to fascism about a month ago and so it's a lot of
[03:01:24.480 --> 03:01:28.760]  new people there that knew nothing about this and then we piggyback down that we
[03:01:28.760 --> 03:01:33.680]  got a hold of Joe Bannister and Sherry Jackson from the movie and Tom Felgus
[03:01:33.680 --> 03:01:39.040]  and we're actually flying them in and having an event this Saturday at
[03:01:39.040 --> 03:01:44.020]  Pastor Broden's church which is Fair Park Bible Fellowship Church at five

[03:01:55.400 --> 03:01:59.240]  gonna have Joe back and some other speakers along that's beautiful I mean
[03:01:59.240 --> 03:02:03.200]  in again everyone getting a local radio show everyone getting an access show
[03:02:03.200 --> 03:02:07.160]  everyone starting a YouTube channel to get trained to show a program director
[03:02:07.160 --> 03:02:11.040]  hey here's my YouTube talk show and if you can just basically talk and you'll
[03:02:11.040 --> 03:02:14.960]  come work for free most stations will give you a slot on the weekend next
[03:02:14.960 --> 03:02:18.680]  you're getting sponsors next you're getting paid to spread liberty I mean
[03:02:18.680 --> 03:02:22.840]  how easy is it on AM and FM stations I don't think people understand that if
[03:02:22.840 --> 03:02:27.120]  you can prove you can talk and aren't a crazy person with a podcast you've done
[03:02:27.120 --> 03:02:31.720]  for a year or something that you can get on major stations you can and and it's
[03:02:31.720 --> 03:02:36.120]  it's harder it's harder in big cities like Dallas and Houston and Chicago but
[03:02:36.120 --> 03:02:40.160]  you can also buy time and people you know panic when they hear that but you
[03:02:40.160 --> 03:02:44.200]  could buy time on a Saturday and Sunday on some of these stations for pennies
[03:02:44.200 --> 03:02:48.840]  and if you get so much for a pay for it how much for an hour show I mean if you've
[03:02:48.840 --> 03:02:52.960]  got a little bit of talent well like WL I'll give you two examples WLS in Chicago
[03:02:52.960 --> 03:02:56.240]  is like the biggest AM station you know in the country they charge like between
[03:02:56.240 --> 03:03:00.000]  thirty five hundred dollars and five grand for an hour right but then there's
[03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:03.080]  other stations around the country you can get an hour for a hundred bucks on
[03:03:03.080 --> 03:03:08.360]  the weekend and exactly and then let's say you've got a restaurant you know at
[03:03:08.360 --> 03:03:11.920]  the corner of whatever you go by the way I'm also a you know evil American
[03:03:11.920 --> 03:03:15.560]  entrepreneur providing service we had great hamburgers great steaks come on
[03:03:15.560 --> 03:03:19.400]  by yeah and once a week we have a Liberty meeting yep and then and then
[03:03:19.400 --> 03:03:22.640]  you'll make the money back from a hundred dollars an hour you're doing it
[03:03:22.640 --> 03:03:25.960]  and then now you could say we're gonna have a gun rally now oh well that's one
[03:03:25.960 --> 03:03:28.960]  way to do it they have all these theaters actually started in Austin where
[03:03:28.960 --> 03:03:32.600]  you can book it because of projectors they're in the film cost get whatever
[03:03:32.600 --> 03:03:36.840]  movie you want in Liberty movies you name it and then once enough people buy
[03:03:36.840 --> 03:03:40.560]  the tickets just because you promote it it books and pays and then you get paid
[03:03:40.560 --> 03:03:44.600]  to have an event at the theater yeah and then see just like what this lady's
[03:03:44.600 --> 03:03:48.600]  talking about is that what you're talking about Regina that's what we did it
[03:03:48.600 --> 03:03:53.200]  was the Inwood theater it was only $400 to rent it and we had the people come
[03:03:53.200 --> 03:03:57.680]  for free and got their their feedback and then got their email and then we
[03:03:57.680 --> 03:04:02.240]  invited them to the next thing see I would charge I would charge so you pay
[03:04:02.240 --> 03:04:07.000]  so you pay back your evil but no but that way you can expand of course no I
[03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:10.160]  mean of course I'm kidding I mean you know there's this new culture it's like
[03:04:10.160 --> 03:04:15.960]  non-profit is is hip and you know God forbid you try and pay your bills and

[03:09:40.120 --> 03:09:46.280]  buddy? I'm alright. Hey first time caller I've been listening to you about 30 days
[03:09:46.280 --> 03:09:52.360]  and it's crazy because about 25 years ago my mom had all these books she's kind
[03:09:52.360 --> 03:09:55.920]  of mysterious she doesn't really get out of the house much. I'm just a
[03:09:55.920 --> 03:10:02.000]  savage kid 15 years old and I come across some of her stuff and it's about you
[03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:07.840]  know the Illuminati all this junk so my mom goes oh well you need to read this
[03:10:07.840 --> 03:10:13.720]  and at first I'm like whoa this is way too much this is crazy over the years I
[03:10:13.720 --> 03:10:18.440]  would take information I would watch the news I'd look at backtrack things and I
[03:10:18.440 --> 03:10:23.120]  say wait a minute it's like a thousand pieces of a puzzle was thrown up on the
[03:10:23.120 --> 03:10:28.560]  floor. Now on top of that I started to put some of this together and I started
[03:10:28.560 --> 03:10:33.000]  telling my friend hey man check this out business crazy and backtrack this oh
[03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:37.840]  whoa whoa how did your mom know that and some people would say I'm like you're
[03:10:37.840 --> 03:10:40.920]  crazy Alex what are you talking about but then now we're talking about in
[03:10:40.920 --> 03:10:45.480]  today's times with technology how fast people all like they can't keep up and
[03:10:45.480 --> 03:10:49.280]  there's so much stuff spewing out. That's right they can't say we're crazy anymore
[03:10:49.280 --> 03:10:53.600]  Matt what do you think's gonna happen as just more and more people realize wow we
[03:10:53.600 --> 03:11:01.360]  really were lied to. I'm shocked at how many people seemingly don't care they're
[03:11:01.360 --> 03:11:05.080]  just happy to kind of keep going on with the day and oh I gotta do you know I
[03:11:05.080 --> 03:11:10.040]  gotta do the same 15 things I do every day I see there's a growing amount of
[03:11:10.040 --> 03:11:15.280]  people for instance the YouTube video my son going through the TSA just
[03:11:15.280 --> 03:11:20.680]  rigmarole from years ago the comments in the beginning were both sides you
[03:11:20.680 --> 03:11:24.360]  know people attacking me people attacking the TSA and so on and today as I
[03:11:24.360 --> 03:11:28.600]  look at it I see more and more people sort of saying wow this is unbelievable
[03:11:28.600 --> 03:11:34.000]  there's less attacking of me for taking the video or or for thinking that it's
[03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:38.520]  wrong or it shouldn't be that way so I think that there's always gonna be a
[03:11:38.520 --> 03:11:43.000]  most people aren't going to be awake and prepared and taking notice of the
[03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:47.760]  things going around them and the goal obviously is to increase the amount of
[03:11:47.760 --> 03:11:50.760]  people that are just kind of paying attention a little bit more and I think
[03:11:50.760 --> 03:11:54.680]  those are mostly younger people I think those are mostly people under 30 under
[03:11:54.680 --> 03:12:00.240]  20 ideally and young folks that's that's why you know my father we're standing in
[03:12:00.240 --> 03:12:03.720]  the line of TSA just for his birthday and I was just I was railing I was like
[03:12:03.720 --> 03:12:06.640]  look at this this is ridiculous and he says you know it's just the way it is
[03:12:06.640 --> 03:12:11.000]  today 20 years ago he wouldn't have said that and now he's you know he's done
[03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:13.960]  it's like well I travel a couple times a year I'll go through it it's no big deal
[03:12:13.960 --> 03:12:18.280]  they're not taking it personal I mean you've got to realize this is on purpose
[03:12:18.280 --> 03:12:23.800]  our government runs Al Qaeda publicly now and do I get an apology from the
[03:12:23.800 --> 03:12:27.880]  neocons for attacking me because they were running them back then right no no
[03:12:27.880 --> 03:12:32.800]  I'm worse because I'm right and so they have Bloomberg and AP and others say I'm
[03:12:32.800 --> 03:12:36.520]  behind Al Qaeda now they publicly are giving them weapons all over the world
[03:12:36.520 --> 03:12:41.440]  and they're coming out saying I'm with Al Qaeda now with no evidence because they
[03:12:41.440 --> 03:12:46.240]  know I know who they are and it's all martial law training that's that's all
[03:12:46.240 --> 03:12:49.800]  this is folks and they're gonna take everything for people out there that
[03:12:49.800 --> 03:12:53.800]  think you're gonna get away with all this you're gonna get away with going
[03:12:53.800 --> 03:12:57.440]  along with all this you're not thank you for the call Alex could hear from you
[03:12:57.440 --> 03:13:01.600]  last caller and then I have a time for sorry the phone systems closed now we're
[03:13:01.600 --> 03:13:07.480]  gonna go to Tom in New York don't know about gay marriage go ahead oh yeah how
[03:13:07.480 --> 03:13:13.880]  you doing Alex I'm I'm all right go ahead okay I have a few comments regarding
[03:13:13.880 --> 03:13:18.600]  the recent gay marriage decisions at the Supreme Court first like to say you
[03:13:18.600 --> 03:13:23.320]  could probably look up at your flag today and know that it represents queer
[03:13:23.320 --> 03:13:32.280]  sex and I'd also like to say I'm one of the plaintiffs in one of the three gay
[03:13:32.280 --> 03:13:38.040]  marriage cases that were reviewed by the Supreme Court this week and this is the
[03:13:38.040 --> 03:13:44.440]  case the mainstream press and the courts tried to suppress and I was on a
[03:13:44.440 --> 03:13:51.120]  local show a few months ago alerting the public to the blatant corruption that
[03:13:51.120 --> 03:13:57.440]  was surrounding these gay marriage cases at the Supreme Court and we alleged
[03:13:57.440 --> 03:14:02.600]  in our own action that the case was rigged right from the moment was filed you
[03:14:02.600 --> 03:14:10.440]  know that the federal courts were being packed with gay clerks and personnel who
[03:14:10.440 --> 03:14:16.440]  were directing these cases to Clinton Obama appointees well I will say this
[03:14:16.440 --> 03:14:20.720]  most most I don't get into people's sexual persuasions to me it's a it's a
[03:14:20.720 --> 03:14:25.680]  big distraction but the Democratic Party and I appreciate your call sir and its
[03:14:25.680 --> 03:14:33.800]  operatives undoubtedly do set up these little gay empires basically and that
[03:14:33.800 --> 03:14:37.000]  comes out all the time at the Justice Department with these women and then they
[03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:43.920]  they persecute the men it's really bizarre and then this obsession of
[03:14:43.920 --> 03:14:47.800]  sexualizing children in the public schools I talked about this in the first
[03:14:47.800 --> 03:14:52.200]  hour today where they weren't each five year olds about all this and there is an
[03:14:52.200 --> 03:14:57.120]  anti-family I mean turn on any TV show and it's anti-family anti-family and
[03:14:57.120 --> 03:15:02.160]  that's about reducing population that's about atomizing cultures because
[03:15:02.160 --> 03:15:08.480]  they're branding it that well if you have a different you know identity or
[03:15:08.480 --> 03:15:12.320]  whatever the government is like your your mob boss that will give you
[03:15:12.320 --> 03:15:16.000]  protection and then meanwhile they're adding all these chemicals and things the
[03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:20.000]  food and water that conflict and confuse people as well and this is all in
[03:15:20.000 --> 03:15:23.120]  brave new world we talked about this earlier in the show what's your take on
[03:15:23.120 --> 03:15:27.440]  this did you did you have a little kid well you have kids I have three toy
[03:15:27.440 --> 03:15:31.760]  story the trilogy the toy store trilogy I haven't seen the last one do you know
[03:15:31.760 --> 03:15:36.680]  the father's name in Toy Story I forget there's no father there is no father
[03:15:36.680 --> 03:15:40.640]  oh that's right there's it they don't ever explain it they don't ever talk
[03:15:40.640 --> 03:15:45.760]  about it it's one of our family favorite movies there's no father I mean it's not
[03:15:45.760 --> 03:15:50.400]  even that dad is a bust out sitting on the couch you know lazy won't play catch
[03:15:50.400 --> 03:15:53.600]  with the kid that sort of thing there is no father they just went you know what
[03:15:53.600 --> 03:15:57.880]  we're not even gonna write it in there and it's one of these things where I
[03:15:57.880 --> 03:16:02.440]  notice when you go and you speak to your kids teachers at their school or when
[03:16:02.440 --> 03:16:07.520]  you voice they ignore the dad and look at the mom yes there's a cult man it's
[03:16:07.520 --> 03:16:12.240]  a cult strange it's I find it disturbing and and usually I'm going in
[03:16:12.240 --> 03:16:16.680]  there not to talk about education it's usually to talk about the things that
[03:16:16.680 --> 03:16:19.960]  are going on in the school like why are you talking to the kids about pole
[03:16:19.960 --> 03:16:24.200]  dancing why are you showing a movie in class that is a basic like a major
[03:16:24.200 --> 03:16:27.760]  motion picture movie that has nothing to do with learning why are we doing these
[03:16:27.760 --> 03:16:31.160]  things why aren't we talking you know oh they automatically trained everybody
[03:16:31.160 --> 03:16:35.160]  that men are stupid every show yeah that's why I like Man of Steel that was a
[03:16:35.160 --> 03:16:40.680]  pro father movie yes yeah you saw it yes I did I saw on Father's Day with my
[03:16:40.680 --> 03:16:45.800]  my kids and my dad but it's so rare yeah I mean you go see Prometheus the
[03:16:45.800 --> 03:16:50.080]  women are in charge and and again when you study slavery the Romans did that
[03:16:50.080 --> 03:16:54.840]  and in slave populations they put the women over the slaves well I saw the
[03:16:54.840 --> 03:17:00.640]  trailer for that Elysium movie yes Jody Foster runs looks like she runs
[03:17:00.640 --> 03:17:03.480]  everything she looks an awful lot like Hillary Clinton in them absolutely no
[03:17:03.480 --> 03:17:07.960]  no but that's the and again it's not that it's that they just replace one
[03:17:07.960 --> 03:17:12.560]  patriarchy with like a government patriarchy where the house slave is the
[03:17:12.560 --> 03:17:16.280]  woman enforcing it yeah and I'm not so it's not even really a matriarch that
[03:17:16.280 --> 03:17:19.840]  men should walk around the house scratching their privates and burping and
[03:17:19.840 --> 03:17:25.560]  acting like Fred Flintstone but you know you have you're supposed to run your
[03:17:25.560 --> 03:17:29.640]  family well I'm gonna be honest women don't go for a real man who's nice to
[03:17:29.640 --> 03:17:33.600]  him but who's in charge of a lot of things they go now for the criminal
[03:17:33.600 --> 03:17:37.120]  that's what's seen as a man it's like you can't be a you know a real good
[03:17:37.120 --> 03:17:41.040]  decent hard-working man you're you're seen as a schmuck then but if you're a
[03:17:41.040 --> 03:17:46.760]  criminal then the women are yeah it's slapping them down it's Willie's it's a
[03:17:46.760 --> 03:17:51.680]  sick society it's everything is upside down and it's but I mean I went and saw
[03:17:51.680 --> 03:17:56.080]  the probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen I wanted to see it after
[03:17:56.080 --> 03:17:59.160]  earth until the second half the second half was actually pretty good but but
[03:17:59.160 --> 03:18:02.720]  it was really low budget you could you know paper mache spaceships so I
[03:18:02.720 --> 03:18:08.120]  actually recommend seeing is it so bad and they had ads for ABC shows the first
[03:18:08.120 --> 03:18:10.960]  ad was the dads and idiot that's what the show's about another and I'm not
[03:18:10.960 --> 03:18:13.960]  really paying attention should just call it that the show's called the dads and
[03:18:13.960 --> 03:18:21.320]  it got dads a moron yeah and then it cuts to the fosters and it's a lesbian
[03:18:21.320 --> 03:18:26.000]  cop with her lesbian wife you know blonde and a black lady and they've got
[03:18:26.000 --> 03:18:30.040]  like eight kids that have been taken from evil parents and the and the bad
[03:18:30.040 --> 03:18:34.360]  guys only show are the biological family they go the biologicals know where
[03:18:34.360 --> 03:18:37.520]  they are like it's a biological weapon and then it shows the female cop like
[03:18:37.520 --> 03:18:42.360]  taking out the man the dad so now they've gone to the next level and that's
[03:18:42.360 --> 03:18:46.840]  what it is the state just sees that as the best way okay well have all these
[03:18:46.840 --> 03:18:49.960]  people plus they're gonna be sterilized anyways can't reproduce the
[03:18:49.960 --> 03:18:54.200]  heterosexual families the homosexual families are really a state unit and
[03:18:54.200 --> 03:18:57.680]  that's the ideal thing it's a woman with a gun everybody else is disarmed and
[03:18:57.680 --> 03:19:01.320]  she's got eight kidnapped kids under her and if the family tries to get them
[03:19:01.320 --> 03:19:04.760]  their terrorist and of course the family will be branded as bad people I mean
[03:19:04.760 --> 03:19:10.320]  this is over the top propaganda over the top well the minute that you get
[03:19:10.320 --> 03:19:13.440]  involved as a father and you I'm sure you've seen this for instance when I
[03:19:13.440 --> 03:19:16.840]  when the FEMA knocked on my door and they saw me ship this network break
[03:19:16.840 --> 03:19:21.480]  let's keep going when when they did they expected a woman to answer or no one
[03:19:21.480 --> 03:19:25.680]  and the minute a man came to the door all of us like a terrorist may be there
[03:19:25.680 --> 03:19:29.400]  yeah and it was like well what's going on and then and and even the guy was a
[03:19:29.400 --> 03:19:33.600]  little nervous when I videotaped it and I put it on YouTube and and notice the
[03:19:33.600 --> 03:19:36.920]  states allowed to be hyper mail though the only thing that could be mail is the
[03:19:36.920 --> 03:19:41.040]  state sure it's got the guys with machine guns and armored vehicles are
[03:19:41.040 --> 03:19:45.240]  sorry go ahead well this guy and he wasn't very masculine but I'll tell you
[03:19:45.240 --> 03:19:49.840]  the guy that he went and reported to looked like military those like wind
[03:19:49.840 --> 03:19:54.160]  breakers like an FBI sort of a jacket except it said FEMA on the back I believe
[03:19:54.160 --> 03:19:58.200]  yeah and he was the guy with the short hair look like he was ex-military and
[03:19:58.200 --> 03:20:02.840]  the long-haired guy went and reported no they sent a good cop trendy in yes yeah
[03:20:02.840 --> 03:20:06.760]  well and I'll tell you what if I if my wife had answered she wouldn't have felt
[03:20:06.760 --> 03:20:10.360]  very threatened by this this guy that came to the door he was real nebulous
[03:20:10.360 --> 03:20:14.360]  and it's all been psychological warfare doubt it's all actuary but I can't
[03:20:14.360 --> 03:20:19.520]  figure out is what why why were they there specifically I know what the
[03:20:19.520 --> 03:20:23.520]  possibilities of what it but it's like well there's other areas in the country
[03:20:23.520 --> 03:20:28.800]  where FEMA is needed right now you all are coming to DuPage County is one of
[03:20:28.800 --> 03:20:32.560]  the richest it's it's the coverage area of CKG it's one of the richest counties
[03:20:32.560 --> 03:20:36.320]  in the United States and there's not a lot of floodplains and problems and
[03:20:36.320 --> 03:20:40.800]  people are struggling right now in Oklahoma and they need FEMA so what are
[03:20:40.800 --> 03:20:43.920]  you doing there well they're on record saying they're sending on all these
[03:20:43.920 --> 03:20:48.040]  agencies just to get you acclimated to the contact just to get you ready to
[03:20:48.040 --> 03:20:52.160]  answer questions you know yearly census now and not every decade and and he
[03:20:52.160 --> 03:20:55.120]  looked like he was really trying to check stuff out when he was there he was
[03:20:55.120 --> 03:20:58.880]  waiting for an invitation he was waiting for a oh you want to come in and just you
[03:20:58.880 --> 03:21:01.040]  know come on in I'll get you a bottle of water and that's how people well that's
[03:21:01.040 --> 03:21:05.200]  like cops now take blood at checkpoints and stand there and go mind about take
[03:21:05.200 --> 03:21:09.760]  blood and then it turns out it's for a federal program and they admit they're
[03:21:09.760 --> 03:21:13.520]  just acclimating us for just taking the blood period well people have a
[03:21:13.520 --> 03:21:16.440]  I mean with somebody in authority a position of authority tells you to do
[03:21:16.440 --> 03:21:23.720]  some put my put my put my laptop on the on the tray okay yes yes yes I I'd I
[03:21:23.720 --> 03:21:28.640]  watched when I flew from England back to Dallas I had to go through TSA again to
[03:21:28.640 --> 03:21:32.840]  go on my flight to Austin and there was like four checkpoints and there are
[03:21:32.840 --> 03:21:39.760]  these two to the you know the classic South Park the same goatees the same
[03:21:39.760 --> 03:21:45.720]  kind of Nellie voice going I told you open passport over there and when they
[03:21:45.720 --> 03:21:50.080]  see me they go they knew I was yeah they're like oh that'll be a quick line
[03:21:50.080 --> 03:21:53.960]  for you sir and they still got the whole speech they still got the whole nine
[03:21:53.960 --> 03:21:58.400]  yards they have five minutes long they were freaking out but the whole point
[03:21:58.400 --> 03:22:05.160]  was everyone submitting they were going I told you I mean it was like do you go
[03:22:05.160 --> 03:22:08.080]  for the pat down is that you make them give you the pad yeah but then I sit
[03:22:08.080 --> 03:22:10.400]  there and you know tell them that you know this is all dog training the
[03:22:10.400 --> 03:22:13.720]  government runs al-qaeda you know it's a fraud better and then they always do a
[03:22:13.720 --> 03:22:19.800]  fake pat down yeah yeah well in not in not in not in Las Vegas this guy was
[03:22:19.800 --> 03:22:23.400]  literally smacking his lips he told me what I talked about the day before on
[03:22:23.400 --> 03:22:27.840]  my show he was very excited he got down his knees when he was doing it and it
[03:22:27.840 --> 03:22:32.520]  was he it was very I was like man you're not my wife it was it was pretty bad
[03:22:32.520 --> 03:22:36.000]  where this was this was in Vegas yeah this is flying out of Vegas I was in
[03:22:36.000 --> 03:22:40.240]  Vegas in May with my father we're in the line to go through TSA four people
[03:22:40.240 --> 03:22:44.360]  ahead of us literally there's like a 22 year old barfing in a bag you know he'd
[03:22:44.360 --> 03:22:48.200]  had a long night he's going home and I'm I'm talking my phone I'm telling him I'm
[03:22:48.200 --> 03:22:51.160]  like we got to go through and take our shoes off they're gonna let a guy who's
[03:22:51.160 --> 03:22:55.640]  actually vomiting get on to the airplane he's gonna go through TSA no problem
[03:22:55.640 --> 03:22:57.960]  they're gonna he's gonna put his arms up they're gonna scan them they're gonna
[03:22:57.960 --> 03:23:01.360]  let him through meanwhile maybe he's sick maybe he's got something that could be
[03:23:01.360 --> 03:23:05.040]  spread to people they're not gonna put him on the side they're gonna make you
[03:23:05.040 --> 03:23:09.200]  to us and everyone else go through take our shoes off take our belts off and all
[03:23:09.200 --> 03:23:12.840]  the whole thing put your arms up get the radiation scan in the whole pit and I
[03:23:12.840 --> 03:23:16.960]  stand and I go through the pat down every time and we're going to Disney
[03:23:16.960 --> 03:23:22.320]  later on in the year and I have four kids two daughters my son that was padded
[03:23:22.320 --> 03:23:26.200]  down last time he he had a broken leg at the time so he was only temporarily in
[03:23:26.200 --> 03:23:29.480]  a wheelchair okay so he's not he's not special needs I apologize for getting
[03:23:29.480 --> 03:23:32.360]  that wrong no that's okay and I want to clarify that there was another video
[03:23:32.360 --> 03:23:36.960]  another kid yeah yeah I apologize okay your son's not special needs but we're
[03:23:36.960 --> 03:23:43.400]  gonna go through and I am anticipating the anxiety of having to look at my
[03:23:43.400 --> 03:23:46.320]  wife and you know you you hope it's like gambling you hope that you're gonna
[03:23:46.320 --> 03:23:49.920]  get the line where they just have magnetometer and then it's no by the way
[03:23:49.920 --> 03:23:53.200]  they're supposed to because it is the law that the groping of the kids is
[03:23:53.200 --> 03:23:57.320]  really illegal they're supposed to direct everybody I have some friends or
[03:23:57.320 --> 03:24:00.240]  musicians that fly all the time and they've got some little kids that you're
[03:24:00.240 --> 03:24:03.760]  supposed to direct them to a magnetometer yeah well we'll see if that
[03:24:03.760 --> 03:24:06.920]  happens because I will videotape it even though my wife's gonna be giving me
[03:24:06.920 --> 03:24:10.640]  you know the look like what are you doing don't see it but see I mean I'm sure
[03:24:10.640 --> 03:24:13.240]  your wife's a great lady he's probably listening right now she ought to be
[03:24:13.240 --> 03:24:19.080]  proud of the fact you're not rolling over yeah but you know they they baby
[03:24:19.080 --> 03:24:23.960]  steps it's all baby steps there's no I get it and women are on average more
[03:24:23.960 --> 03:24:28.600]  compliant with the state on average I'm not psychoanalyzing your wife my wife's
[03:24:28.600 --> 03:24:31.840]  really smart knows what's going on but she's the same way yeah like when I'm
[03:24:31.840 --> 03:24:35.120]  about to start preaching at people in a restaurant if something happens I'll get
[03:24:35.120 --> 03:24:38.800]  up uses an excuse or in grocery store lines she's like can't you ever turn it
[03:24:38.800 --> 03:24:43.040]  off but I'm like hey I know I'm but then if something rubs her wrong I'll be
[03:24:43.040 --> 03:24:45.520]  telling her please turn it off yeah you know it's kind of like when your kids
[03:24:45.520 --> 03:24:49.240]  are being bad whoever sees them being bad yells at him or whatever and then the
[03:24:49.240 --> 03:24:52.760]  other spouse goes hey you know don't be so mad at him but I'm like well that's
[03:24:52.760 --> 03:24:55.560]  because you didn't see the build up to this right right I think that's more of
[03:24:55.560 --> 03:25:01.480]  what it is yeah you know the the idea of them going through what Rocco went
[03:25:01.480 --> 03:25:05.200]  through in that video a couple years back that's a cool name it took me like
[03:25:05.200 --> 03:25:09.160]  five years my wife is from Iowa so that name was like might as well as been you
[03:25:09.160 --> 03:25:14.200]  know Guido to her but to have him go through that again or to have my
[03:25:14.200 --> 03:25:19.200]  daughters my youngest daughter's only 15 months old you know and the rub about
[03:25:19.200 --> 03:25:23.920]  this is no pun intended is when you go through that you skip the magnetometer
[03:25:23.920 --> 03:25:28.000]  so today on my way here I didn't go through the magnetometer because I got
[03:25:28.000 --> 03:25:31.080]  the pad down so I didn't go through a metal detector they don't know what's on
[03:25:31.080 --> 03:25:36.080]  me all they did was feel there's it's actually less secure so by saying that
[03:25:36.080 --> 03:25:39.920]  you want to opt out they're not checking to see if you have metal but they
[03:25:39.920 --> 03:25:43.880]  admit that that's meant to pressure you into taking the scanner of course it is
[03:25:43.880 --> 03:25:46.760]  and then you know and then they're checking you for explosives like that's
[03:25:46.760 --> 03:25:51.280]  the only thing that you could possibly do wrong but I mean these are the people
[03:25:51.280 --> 03:25:55.080]  that didn't want to arm the pilots who were armed before but didn't choose to
[03:25:55.080 --> 03:25:59.200]  exercise it we're gonna trust them with the aircraft yeah that's a thousand times
[03:25:59.200 --> 03:26:02.120]  more deadly ten thousand times more deadly I mean I can even do the math on
[03:26:02.120 --> 03:26:06.920]  that but you're you know a flying missile a giant missile with hundreds of
[03:26:06.920 --> 03:26:11.800]  people on but you can't trust them with the gun it's true you know I read you
[03:26:11.800 --> 03:26:15.280]  saw the video of that man that broke into the woman's house and just it has
[03:26:15.280 --> 03:26:19.800]  been everywhere and he beat her and it's just almost impossible to watch it's
[03:26:19.800 --> 03:26:22.560]  seeing those sorts of things are the sorts of no I'll be honest I haven't seen
[03:26:22.560 --> 03:26:25.520]  that video my god we should play a clip and I should talk about it oh it's
[03:26:25.520 --> 03:26:29.600]  horrible oh that's nothing about this movie after earth these big fat alien
[03:26:29.600 --> 03:26:32.560]  things attack and no one's got a weapon to kill them because they're like
[03:26:32.560 --> 03:26:36.880]  liberals you're allowed to use a sword oh I'm sorry go ahead Alex this I mean
[03:26:36.880 --> 03:26:40.600]  this is the name of the video I don't know but I'll find it afterward it's
[03:26:40.600 --> 03:26:44.520]  it's a it's a nanny cam it was all over television yesterday and a man breaks
[03:26:44.520 --> 03:26:49.240]  into a woman's house and he I mean he beats her and hurts her in front of her
[03:26:49.240 --> 03:26:53.000]  child and so then you know obviously after that there's a debate about well
[03:26:53.000 --> 03:26:55.480]  if she would have had a gun blah blah blah and then the gun people are saying
[03:26:55.480 --> 03:26:59.760]  well it would have been locked up and the thought of that is the sort of thing
[03:26:59.760 --> 03:27:03.200]  that I'll tell you was he a mugger or something yeah he was robbing he was a
[03:27:03.200 --> 03:27:07.680]  home invader robbing their home and they haven't found him yet so they're
[03:27:07.680 --> 03:27:10.920]  talking about how great it is that she will you come in my house you're dead
[03:27:10.920 --> 03:27:16.440]  effect also people on air right now and people are so scared of firearms I mean
[03:27:16.440 --> 03:27:19.440]  you come in here trying to kill people it's over well you got a bunch of here
[03:27:19.440 --> 03:27:22.120]  right you can carry that we got a bunch of guys that are armed back I think it's
[03:27:22.120 --> 03:27:26.600]  great but I mean what's the big deal yeah I mean the criminals gonna have a
[03:27:26.600 --> 03:27:31.480]  gun anyways what is that a 45 as this is 357 nice I mean I only have this
[03:27:31.480 --> 03:27:34.760]  because even though I'm a good shot and good with a you know like more complex
[03:27:34.760 --> 03:27:39.840]  firearms and semi-autos under stress yeah I mean with this even short barrel
[03:27:39.840 --> 03:27:46.480]  a medium barrel I can shoot a man size target at 7500 yards okay so somebody
[03:27:46.480 --> 03:27:50.800]  comes in here I'm not missing yeah and and plus this is pretty much a high
[03:27:50.800 --> 03:27:54.560]  velocity almost a rival around so this is one of the most deadly rounds out there
[03:27:54.560 --> 03:27:59.440]  for handguns much better happen if you whip that out in Chicago in a mall you
[03:27:59.440 --> 03:28:02.920]  know or you had it in your studio if you were in Mancow student you took it out
[03:28:02.920 --> 03:28:07.280]  people would crap their pants it but if they saw the government whether they'd
[03:28:07.280 --> 03:28:11.480]  be feel safe right right there's nothing wrong with that your whole you're an
[03:28:11.480 --> 03:28:15.400]  American man you you you have a void car you you know you've done all the things
[03:28:15.400 --> 03:28:19.280]  by the way you can't get ammo in Chicago by the way we have butcher knives in
[03:28:19.280 --> 03:28:23.320]  there right right or swimming pools kids can drown in swimming or dive from
[03:28:23.320 --> 03:28:27.640]  that I have whatever this man broke into her house and he pummeled her what a
[03:28:27.640 --> 03:28:31.680]  tough guy was disgusting I mean it was just revolting and my thought was well
[03:28:31.680 --> 03:28:34.400]  yeah great if she would have a gun except if it was that it right there
[03:28:34.400 --> 03:28:41.480]  scroll down yes oh god it's terrible you've it is disgusting to see this and
[03:28:41.480 --> 03:28:45.840]  what why is he doing this to her he's robbing the home and worse off the her
[03:28:45.840 --> 03:28:51.800]  child is watching and and if you have a gun great but if you have it locked up
[03:28:51.800 --> 03:28:55.960]  and you don't have ammo close by you still can't do anything this man did we
[03:28:55.960 --> 03:29:00.960]  post this on info wars on believable and he keeps coming back this guy is a
[03:29:00.960 --> 03:29:05.840]  complete lunatic and then he throws her down the stairs she's here's the
