[00:59.040 --> 01:03.920]  with the formation of the European Union that's key to understand who formed the
[01:03.920 --> 01:09.440]  European Union to have the facts on who runs our planet who controls our
[01:09.440 --> 01:18.680]  society today and where we are going as a nation and as a planet this deals with
[01:18.680 --> 01:24.520]  eugenics this deals with the hopes and dreams of the New World Order what makes
[01:24.520 --> 01:30.320]  them tick and we have a lot of research we covered in the past but some new big
[01:30.320 --> 01:38.000]  developments have come to the fore so we'll be breaking that down today I had
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.760]  a chance to take off three full broadcast days Thursday Friday and Sunday
[01:42.760 --> 01:52.160]  refreshing respite feels like I had a hundred years off after working 16 18
[01:52.160 --> 01:57.880]  hours a day almost continually for the last six eight months I've come to
[01:57.880 --> 02:03.760]  realization I need to take off more time because the sharpness comes back to the
[02:03.760 --> 02:12.120]  psyche to the intellect things become so much clearer and large founts our
[02:12.120 --> 02:20.920]  wellsprings of energy that had almost been forgotten returned so I'm gonna be

[02:26.000 --> 02:34.080]  notes though a lot was out of town a lot of ideas a lot of points and I filled
[02:34.080 --> 02:38.440]  up a small notebook with them I'm gonna try to codify those in the next few days
[02:38.440 --> 02:44.320]  and do a special broadcast sometime this week later in the week dealing
[02:44.320 --> 02:53.400]  specifically but properly with the architecture of the New World Order now

[08:19.880 --> 08:23.320]  Alex Jones
[08:23.320 --> 08:51.040]  dole tree number to join us on air today 1-800-259-92 31 1-800-259-92 31 let
[08:51.040 --> 08:56.040]  me run through some of the headlines here even the Associated Press and
[08:56.040 --> 09:02.920]  article titled stimulus watch early road aid leaves out neediest this gives us a
[09:02.920 --> 09:07.160]  small window because you've got to look through all the different windows to get
[09:07.160 --> 09:12.720]  a clear picture because the media always covers things piecemeal to learn that
[09:12.720 --> 09:18.480]  the White House had promised that the 787 million dollar bailout would be
[09:18.480 --> 09:22.680]  fully accounted for and completely transparent instead it's basically
[09:22.680 --> 09:27.600]  completely secret remember this is the same White House following in the
[09:27.600 --> 09:33.320]  footsteps of previous White House is just intensifying the the deception the
[09:33.320 --> 09:44.640]  level of the arrogance the level of the over-the-top lying they came out and
[09:44.640 --> 09:51.000]  said that we are fighting against bonuses for CEOs and for executives of
[09:51.000 --> 09:54.480]  brokerage firms and banks that receive the trillions and trillions of
[09:54.480 --> 09:58.920]  dollars of tarp money it turned out of course the White House publicly signed
[09:58.920 --> 10:05.120]  an executive order and pressured senator Dodd who later blew the whistle when he
[10:05.120 --> 10:08.320]  got the blame for it politically said hey don't blame me White House you told
[10:08.320 --> 10:12.000]  me to and we don't have to believe Dodd on that the White House was on record
[10:12.000 --> 10:19.960]  signing an accompanying executive order with the law that he helped pass this is
[10:19.960 --> 10:27.960]  the level of just amazing hypocrisy specifically protecting giant cash
[10:27.960 --> 10:38.320]  bonuses for the CEOs of the brokerage firms and big banks you got to hand it
[10:38.320 --> 10:44.440]  to him though it's just amazing arrogance to come out on TV and shake his
[10:44.440 --> 10:49.320]  finger at the corporations that pay for his way that have bought and paid for
[10:49.320 --> 10:54.360]  everything he's done his political career in life the foundations that first
[10:54.360 --> 10:58.840]  funded him in college and out of college the foundations that ran him for the
[10:58.840 --> 11:06.280]  Senate in the state house in Illinois and then for the US Senate the
[11:06.280 --> 11:10.040]  foundations and big banks and brokerage firms that gave him four times the
[11:10.040 --> 11:15.840]  money on average sometimes five times the case of Goldman Sachs what John
[11:15.840 --> 11:20.480]  McCain was given and no every time I mentioned that I'm not saying vote for
[11:20.480 --> 11:26.480]  John McCain the point is is that if the mafia sends two hit men out to kill the
[11:26.480 --> 11:31.440]  Republic out to take your freedom all I'm saying is both those guys are hit men
[11:31.440 --> 11:35.480]  hope those guys work for the New World Order they're here to kill our free
[11:35.480 --> 11:41.960]  society they're here to dominate us to conquer us to use surface to stand their
[11:41.960 --> 11:51.040]  flag up on our nation's corpse and declare victory like they were rough
[11:51.040 --> 11:54.600]  necks going up San Juan Hill
[11:56.680 --> 12:01.440]  or the Marines up on the mountain and Iwo Jima except it's not Marines
[12:01.440 --> 12:08.640]  conquering some far off Island in the Pacific after rousing the Japanese it's
[12:08.640 --> 12:12.480]  criminal foreign corporate takeover through the governmental and
[12:12.480 --> 12:19.200]  institutional systems of the nation so there's one article I want to get into
[12:19.200 --> 12:23.560]  also Cheney is saying Obama endangers the nation this gives him left cover
[12:23.560 --> 12:30.760]  they have Cheney come out and go every week Cheney says look Obama's a big
[12:30.760 --> 12:35.080]  liberal he's freeing all the Taliban al-Qaeda people he's a big liberal he's
[12:35.080 --> 12:39.480]  stopping the torture and stopping the waterboarding and stopping the illegal
[12:39.480 --> 12:46.720]  spying Cheney's a guy with a nine percent approval rating and so the
[12:46.720 --> 12:50.680]  establishment and Cheney himself knows this is all part of the little dance by
[12:50.680 --> 12:55.440]  coming out and attacking Obama and saying he's a big liberal who's basically
[12:55.440 --> 13:01.240]  giving them the Arabs and Central Asians they hold it all these camps backrubs
[13:01.240 --> 13:07.920]  and you know jacuzzi's and and they're playing golf at club fed which is not
[13:07.920 --> 13:15.240]  true that's all part of the theatrical backdrop people they hold there by
[13:15.240 --> 13:19.280]  Cheney coming out and doing this because Cheney's not stupid Cheney works for
[13:19.280 --> 13:23.120]  the very same people to control Obama he knows Obama is continuing all of their
[13:23.120 --> 13:27.000]  policies and protecting the Bush administration on record for
[13:27.000 --> 13:31.800]  investigations of torture and waterboarding and saying they were
[13:31.800 --> 13:37.560]  above the law and stealing money and corporate payoffs and no bid contracts and
[13:37.560 --> 13:43.520]  everything else it's seamless continuation of the last policies you
[13:43.520 --> 13:47.880]  know even the MIT controlled leftist no Chomsky's out admitting that and being
[13:47.880 --> 13:51.840]  held at right now by the controlled left they're speaking out against the
[13:51.840 --> 14:02.680]  Messiah Barack Obama the newest puppet the newest diversion so Cheney is coming
[14:02.680 --> 14:09.280]  out and criticizing Obama for things Obama isn't doing knowing that he is
[14:09.280 --> 14:16.160]  energizing the left and the 91% of the public not just the left but the 91% of
[14:16.160 --> 14:20.720]  the public that hate Mr. Cheney who has the lowest approval rating of any
[14:20.720 --> 14:27.640]  politician since the modern age of polling they know what they're doing
[14:27.640 --> 14:32.000]  they're hurting the left wing on one side the right wing on the other forming a
[14:32.000 --> 14:42.120]  wedge forming a V with the point aimed down with us the pheasants in the in the
[14:42.120 --> 14:46.760]  mouth of the V being driven out of the woods into the field so the globalists
[14:46.760 --> 14:53.560]  can pick us off at their leisure it's a drum beating sport they're out flogging
[14:53.560 --> 14:57.720]  the bushes to drive us out into the open and they do it to the left right
[14:57.720 --> 15:03.040]  control paradigm and if you like being suckered by this elementary level
[15:03.040 --> 15:10.560]  military maneuver then I don't understand why you like being fools I
[15:10.560 --> 15:16.520]  really don't understand it it's so elementary we're gonna play this clip
[15:16.520 --> 15:21.800]  later White House Correspondents dinner Wanda
[15:23.720 --> 15:30.720]  Sykes thinks Rush Limbaugh needs to die of kidney failure and a bunch of other
[15:30.720 --> 15:35.040]  stuff again energizing the left-right paradigm that gives Limbaugh and the
[15:35.040 --> 15:40.920]  fake right power when they see the left of these outrageous things and then
[15:40.920 --> 15:46.080]  that gives the control left power as well energizes their base and then makes
[15:46.080 --> 15:49.440]  the American people divide into two camps fighting with each other instead of
[15:49.440 --> 15:55.160]  joining together against the transnational crime syndicate by the way I
[15:55.160 --> 16:00.080]  have another disgusting video clip the San Antonio we are changed shot of
[16:00.080 --> 16:05.440]  Clinton down there getting a Prince of Peace award and they say it and then the
[16:05.440 --> 16:10.520]  audience kind of gasp and then has a little giggle in the background of I
[16:10.520 --> 16:15.240]  mean they know it's what they're doing is just very offensive even if you're an
[16:15.240 --> 16:19.200]  atheist you know it's not good to insult Christians and it's certainly not
[16:19.200 --> 16:25.440]  good to like a Jim Jones cult leader imply you are Jesus Christ but that's
[16:25.440 --> 16:29.000]  what they do they say Bill Clinton is basically Jesus Christ the Prince of
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.440]  Peace and have you ever watched the UN introduction ceremonies for world leaders
[16:33.440 --> 16:37.800]  they call them excellencies and grand supreme leaders I mean these people are
[16:37.800 --> 16:44.360]  really sick they also have other tricks like making fun of these petty front
[16:44.360 --> 16:48.680]  men like Gordon Brown and George Bush and Barack Obama you know that there's
[16:48.680 --> 16:53.320]  also the sport of kicking them around like Nixon said you want to have Dick
[16:53.320 --> 16:57.280]  Nixon to kick around anymore and do a certain except that's true the
[16:57.280 --> 17:00.040]  establishment loves to build them up as leaders and we're doing one phase the
[17:00.040 --> 17:03.560]  agenda and when the folks wake up that they're being kind they then destroy
[17:03.560 --> 17:06.920]  them and turn that into a spectacle that's going on in the news right now
[17:06.920 --> 17:10.920]  all these embarrassing things keep happening day after day to mr. New World
[17:10.920 --> 17:15.760]  Order mr. World government himself Gordon Brown tips on how he can apply his
[17:15.760 --> 17:20.920]  makeup you know we're left in a taxi cab and that's that's that's big news not
[17:20.920 --> 17:24.160]  how the British government's official policy is to forcibly reduce their
[17:24.160 --> 17:31.520]  population in the next 20 years by half from 60 million to 30 million so we'll
[17:31.520 --> 17:35.760]  go over that something I meant to get to two last week I was reminded about it
[17:35.760 --> 17:38.280]  when there was another article written about it today in Los Angeles Times the
[17:38.280 --> 17:43.360]  original one was seeking to save the planet with a thesaurus about how they're
[17:43.360 --> 17:46.480]  going away from global warming you know they say in these internal White House
[17:46.480 --> 17:51.640]  memos they say put out that are done by these think tanks forum oh the people
[17:51.640 --> 17:56.040]  know the earth heats and cools on its own now they figured out there's
[17:56.040 --> 18:00.720]  actually seasons and not just yearly seasons but 11 year seasons and other
[18:00.720 --> 18:08.200]  cycles going on so now we'll just say that the earth is dying and that we're
[18:08.200 --> 18:14.640]  basically losing our atmosphere that the atmosphere is off-gassing that that's
[18:14.640 --> 18:18.640]  gonna be the new one which might be happening you never know I don't know
[18:18.640 --> 18:22.240]  why they're chemtrailing up there they are acting like something's going on
[18:22.240 --> 18:28.000]  maybe it was all the hydrogen bombs the Russians the French the British the
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.200]  Chinese the United States detonated in the upper atmosphere admittedly blowing
[18:32.200 --> 18:41.320]  holes in large areas the atmosphere but I mean I don't know anymore these people
[18:41.320 --> 18:49.840]  are complete psychopaths we'll get into that there is a systematic purging of
[18:49.840 --> 18:57.160]  channels out there on YouTube they volunteers set up an info wars channel
[18:57.160 --> 19:01.880]  separately run by another fellow and they came in and deleted that even though
[19:01.880 --> 19:10.120]  it was just my show and said basically no more Alex Jones I don't really even at
[19:10.120 --> 19:14.720]  this point know what to do about this situation you dovetail this with House

[24:59.400 --> 25:06.280]  remember back during the Ron Paul campaign was it a case of South Carolina
[25:06.280 --> 25:10.800]  where that we had the family on where the police busted down the door without a
[25:10.800 --> 25:17.560]  warrant some cop didn't like a Ron Paul sign and roughed up the man and woman and
[25:17.560 --> 25:22.280]  then took him to jail they later got an apology I mean where do they find these
[25:22.280 --> 25:26.960]  lunatics and people all over the nation would go out the side of the highway and
[25:26.960 --> 25:32.040]  hold up Ron Paul signs or info wars.com signs we've seen so many cases of that
[25:32.040 --> 25:35.800]  and the police come and say you're not allowed to do that here in America there's
[25:35.800 --> 25:39.080]  a free speech zone down behind the baseball field downtown if you want to
[25:39.080 --> 25:44.800]  go there this is out of the Bloomington alternative state criminalizes shouting
[25:44.800 --> 25:53.040]  about I-69 they said no protest allowed basically anywhere I'm gonna get the
[25:53.040 --> 25:57.160]  group on that this is really happening folks they're really brainwashed the
[25:57.160 --> 26:02.040]  cops and now they're turning them loose on us and the courts are corrupt in this
[26:02.040 --> 26:06.320]  country they're really moving against free speech everybody's free speech
[26:06.320 --> 26:11.720]  right now you you protest the North American Union they tell you it doesn't
[26:11.720 --> 26:15.280]  exist you get their own documents and say look I know it exists and I'm not
[26:15.280 --> 26:22.840]  buying your con game anymore they say okay arrest them help us man the New
[26:22.840 --> 26:28.160]  World Order is moving so fast right now they are just butchering the economy
[26:28.160 --> 26:33.000]  butchering all of our liberties and since you're in me all over the place
[26:33.000 --> 26:38.080]  because we've really started exploding in the AM and FM audience the internet
[26:38.080 --> 26:42.760]  audience the shortwave audience the satellite audience the videos people are
[26:42.760 --> 26:45.640]  seeing online you know I called in Thursday to the show and Burmese was
[26:45.640 --> 26:51.280]  sitting in doing a great job and I am I talked about everywhere I go I'm
[26:51.280 --> 26:56.520]  probably saying 40 50% of the people that come up to me saying hey I listen to
[26:56.520 --> 27:03.960]  show they say I found out about it on YouTube YouTube YouTube YouTube and I'm
[27:03.960 --> 27:10.960]  gonna get a list you know they've got to have a ranking of the top video websites
[27:10.960 --> 27:16.000]  and we can compile those men maybe have an activist center on info wars.com and
[27:16.000 --> 27:21.360]  prisonplanet.com so we can have volunteers and people create channels with
[27:21.360 --> 27:26.080]  the video that I do live every day from at least the last two hours one to three
[27:26.080 --> 27:30.960]  that's posted in high quality and streams live prisonplanet.tv members and
[27:30.960 --> 27:33.880]  we appreciate all those great members but then folks take that and post it all
[27:33.880 --> 27:39.240]  over YouTube and it and there was an Alex Jones fan website that had gotten up
[27:39.240 --> 27:45.760]  to it was getting starting to get like a million views a week you could add up
[27:45.760 --> 27:49.240]  the videos he was posting about 15 a day they were starting to really build
[27:49.240 --> 27:53.680]  about a million a week and you can see the growth curve was just explosive that
[27:53.680 --> 27:57.560]  it was soon gonna be two million a week and that's just one little channel so
[27:57.560 --> 28:00.320]  they shot that down they've been shutting down other Alex Jones channels
[28:00.320 --> 28:08.240]  from other fans and you know the answer is is to create duplicate accounts under
[28:08.240 --> 28:12.640]  other names other emails not link them up the answer is also go to some of the
[28:12.640 --> 28:18.080]  other biggest in the other sub video sites that aren't anywhere besides the
[28:18.080 --> 28:23.880]  YouTube but also start posting religiously to those and we'll start trying
[28:23.880 --> 28:27.760]  to link to those others and also drive traffic to those build those up just to
[28:27.760 --> 28:32.000]  be able to get our word out because this these system has figured out that
[28:32.000 --> 28:37.920]  YouTube is one of our biggest places to reach new people and you know we're
[28:37.920 --> 28:41.680]  talking millions a week just with YouTube folks we're reaching millions of new
[28:41.680 --> 28:46.040]  people I mean I'm it's getting to where I walk in gas stations anywhere in the
[28:46.040 --> 28:48.960]  country and they go hey your Alex Jones how you doing I like your show where'd
[28:48.960 --> 28:53.280]  you find out about it oh I heard you on YouTube I saw you on YouTube then I
[28:53.280 --> 28:56.240]  checked out your site and listen every day or found out it was local station or
[28:56.240 --> 29:02.240]  then I heard you on George Norrie like 10% of the time it's George Norrie 50% of
[29:02.240 --> 29:07.960]  the time and I'd say YouTube the 20 30% it's a news articles and the websites
[29:07.960 --> 29:13.720]  themselves but we're under a massive censorship and attack right now because
[29:13.720 --> 29:18.680]  we are effective because we're hitting on all cylinders and we know who the
[29:18.680 --> 29:22.320]  globalist are we know what their agenda is and we have a track record of being
[29:22.320 --> 29:27.200]  right and people are discovering five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
[29:27.200 --> 29:33.200]  thirteen year old TV shows and radio shows and folks are flipping out how
[29:33.200 --> 29:39.640]  accurate they are in today's context well I hate to steal my own thunder here
[29:39.640 --> 29:44.600]  but I really didn't do that much I was reading public CFR documents Pentagon

[30:12.720 --> 30:16.840]  nation's power grid some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may
[30:16.840 --> 30:21.280]  finally push the grid over its edge creating a cascade of power outages
[30:21.280 --> 30:26.040]  across the country putting us all in the dark are you prepared for the next round
[30:26.040 --> 30:30.280]  of storm related outages or government created blackouts have you ever thought

[34:51.320 --> 34:55.600]  I did some camp and then went to the beach for a couple days Texas beach with
[34:55.600 --> 35:01.600]  my children and I went on to the Padre Island national seashore and you would
[35:01.600 --> 35:11.280]  have thought driving through the guard shack that I was entering North Korea no
[35:11.280 --> 35:17.080]  exaggeration there had to be more than 20 cameras that scan your face that scan
[35:17.080 --> 35:20.200]  the side of your car the top of your car your license plate from five different
[35:20.200 --> 35:27.280]  angles it looks like something out of a science fiction movie and of course you're
[35:27.280 --> 35:31.600]  asked questions by the guards when you're going in if you try to take any of
[35:31.600 --> 35:35.520]  the ferries across any islands there now and I said I wouldn't go back to
[35:35.520 --> 35:39.080]  Bolivar I went there last year with my children for three days and every time
[35:39.080 --> 35:47.160]  we went over on the ferry they searched our car every time and it's just all
[35:47.160 --> 35:53.160]  about a atmosphere of fear training the police that there's terrorist everywhere
[35:53.160 --> 35:59.000]  creating this heightened sense of bizarre paranoia and training all
[35:59.000 --> 36:03.320]  Americans everywhere to live in an airport it's like America is gonna be a
[36:03.320 --> 36:07.800]  giant airport and they'll always phase in the latest level of slavery that
[36:07.800 --> 36:11.920]  will then be implemented in the rest of society in two places in the public
[36:11.920 --> 36:17.400]  schools and in the airports dogs searching you dogs searching your bags
[36:17.400 --> 36:22.720]  your locker cameras in the school rooms the classrooms the library the bathrooms

[36:55.880 --> 37:06.800]  taking your shoes off in an active submission and an active slavery it's
[37:06.800 --> 37:11.480]  all absolute bull bunch of technocrat eugenicists playing God running the
[37:11.480 --> 37:19.880]  whole show okay I said I go your calls and there's no where to run it's a new
[37:19.880 --> 37:25.560]  world order and this system hurts 99 plus percent of us it hurts the
[37:25.560 --> 37:36.780]  enforcers it hurts everybody and it's a tattletale paranoid society at the
[37:36.780 --> 37:42.440]  beach I went to this little funky condo rental place I've been going since I
[37:42.440 --> 37:48.880]  was a teenager and about five six years ago they got a security guard know
[37:48.880 --> 37:51.960]  whatever gets broken into nothing ever goes on the times I've been there a
[37:51.960 --> 38:01.360]  couple times a year and then they got security guards then a few years ago I
[38:01.360 --> 38:05.000]  noticed they'd ask you questions in the parking lot or come up bug their eyes
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.400]  out at you at the pool and then now they just follow you around everywhere and
[38:09.400 --> 38:13.000]  follow everybody around and mind you and boss you around and that's what
[38:13.000 --> 38:17.080]  America is and then everybody's a tattletale you know everybody gets
[38:17.080 --> 38:22.920]  tattled on and everybody tattles and everybody minds everyone and God this
[38:22.920 --> 38:28.120]  country's going into such bondage such a nation of trash a nation of
[38:28.120 --> 38:35.200]  cowards a nation of scum a nation of a feminine weak not need unadventurous
[38:35.200 --> 38:41.120]  cowardly people with an overlay of fake masculinity and strutting and and
[38:41.120 --> 39:01.440]  posing a nation of gelded cowards we are going into a giant prison and it's a
[39:01.440 --> 39:17.360]  charnel house of ours it is a terrible butcher butcher's lair we enter and I
[39:17.360 --> 39:20.720]  know what it is I know I'm right you know I really believe the things I say
[39:20.720 --> 39:26.280]  here on the show I I really do the research I know I'm right I'm not
[39:26.280 --> 39:30.640]  embellishing not exaggerating far from it I can't articulate just how real all
[39:30.640 --> 39:44.280]  of this is and I have a sense of satisfaction that I fought it I put on a
[39:44.280 --> 39:51.040]  decent fight but the same time I struggle with great feelings of guilt and
[39:51.040 --> 39:57.280]  remorse that I haven't spent my time on this planet better that I didn't have
[39:57.280 --> 40:04.080]  more energy that I wasn't a stronger man that I wasn't as weak as I am that I
[40:04.080 --> 40:10.280]  wasn't as petty as I am that I wasn't as fleshly and worldly as I am make us
[40:10.280 --> 40:23.600]  like it or not we're the big game in town this little operation we're it we're
[40:23.600 --> 40:36.000]  the best there is and that ain't saying much is it and so I'm gonna try to dig
[40:36.000 --> 40:40.760]  deep in my psyche and try to be more professional more focused more serious
[40:40.760 --> 40:44.720]  to truly articulate my understanding of the new world order that is much more
[40:44.720 --> 40:51.920]  advanced than what we've displayed on air or even in the films which tend to be
[40:51.920 --> 41:01.280]  more polished and articulate presentation I dedicate myself I dedicate
[41:01.280 --> 41:10.680]  my life my name everything I am everything I'll ever be to try and to
[41:10.680 --> 41:15.880]  tell the very closest thing to the truth as I can because no man knows total
[41:15.880 --> 41:21.240]  truth only God knows that we all see three rose colored glasses but I I strive
[41:21.240 --> 41:25.960]  to be as honest as I can I strive to be as accurate as I can I strive to portray
[41:25.960 --> 41:37.200]  the clearest picture of the world that I can and I give you my commitment and I
[41:37.200 --> 41:45.600]  give you my word that I am attempting to take this radio show and everything we
[41:45.600 --> 41:56.520]  do to the next level whatever the cost may be I
[41:58.600 --> 42:03.800]  when I got into all this I didn't realize how deep the water was how
[42:03.800 --> 42:14.280]  treacherous the shoals were how rocky the reefs truly are people tell me well
[42:14.280 --> 42:18.920]  what are the solutions what do we do to turn this around to fix it and I give a
[42:18.920 --> 42:21.480]  lot of solutions we talk about a lot of solutions we have a lot of guests on
[42:21.480 --> 42:25.360]  talk about solutions but mainly it's you waking up and taking action and getting
[42:25.360 --> 42:35.000]  involved you're the solution asking God for guidance is a solution have a
[42:35.000 --> 42:40.720]  respect for yourself and challenging evil wherever you find it and not back
[42:40.720 --> 42:44.680]  and down and states rights and rediscovering liberty and cutting the
[42:44.680 --> 42:48.960]  size of government and and and having stronger families and and realizing the
[42:48.960 --> 42:52.160]  families under assault and having that understanding that you're under assault
[42:52.160 --> 42:55.600]  that can bring the family together and bypass a lot of the mindless fights and
[42:55.600 --> 43:03.840]  arguments and things that go on that we've been engineered to engage in and
[43:03.840 --> 43:10.680]  you know I say this is a nation of trash I mean the overlying current the
[43:10.680 --> 43:22.120]  over driving direction the overall tackiness the kind of mad rush to
[43:22.120 --> 43:32.840]  whatever the latest fad is in the quickness to be sold a bill of goods
[43:32.840 --> 43:43.400]  and then run on to the next I'm tacky I'm trashy you know when I sit here and
[43:43.400 --> 43:49.320]  say that I'm not indicting I'm not indicting the whole country in the whole
[43:49.320 --> 43:53.560]  world without indicting myself I can recognize what it is though it's a
[43:53.560 --> 44:02.480]  fundamental trashiness it's fundamental weakness fundamental decadence we do
[44:02.480 --> 44:07.120]  come from great explorers and inventors and people of great courage and great
[44:07.120 --> 44:15.200]  will and great capacity for good and evil and through the adversity that
[44:15.200 --> 44:19.320]  carved out this continent and all the countless conflicts and wars that took
[44:19.320 --> 44:32.460]  place a great independent people were developed and we lean heavily on the
[44:32.460 --> 44:39.800]  bones of the past that form a type of mental crutch for what we are today and
[44:39.800 --> 44:48.200]  what we are today is a very evil wicked degenerate people who need to repent and
[44:48.200 --> 44:53.560]  I'll say this to the atheists and the agnostics and the rest of you I don't
[44:53.560 --> 44:58.800]  expect you to go into repent in one of these 501c3 whorehouses with a little
[44:58.800 --> 45:09.360]  glitter bug sparkling creature up there in a fancy suit reading off a
[45:09.360 --> 45:21.000]  teleprompter like its Barbie dress-up hour for more dress-up make-believe with
[45:21.000 --> 45:26.400]  the childlike public but I'll tell you something right now there's a lot more
[45:26.400 --> 45:31.560]  to this universe than meets the eye there's a lot of things that meet the
[45:31.560 --> 45:38.040]  eye that you don't recognize that you don't see the world as a child sees it
[45:38.040 --> 45:49.520]  I believe the key to wisdom and the key to true enlightenment is innocence a
[45:49.520 --> 45:58.640]  child sees a ferris wheel or a tree or a river or a little creek or even a
[45:58.640 --> 46:05.800]  fort in an inner city backyard with garbage all over the ground they see it
[46:05.800 --> 46:14.320]  with wonderment and amazement the world is new to them the universe is open to
[46:14.320 --> 46:20.360]  them and they rightfully are in awe and taken back at it and I think it's that
[46:20.360 --> 46:26.720]  sense of wonderment and that sense of awe that we have lost and people think
[46:26.720 --> 46:41.840]  that being worldly makes one deep or intelligent or knowledgeable and that
[46:41.840 --> 46:47.040]  may be true to a certain extent if you don't go too far down that road but I
[46:47.040 --> 46:52.520]  think the worldly things I've done the bad things I've done the things I've
[46:52.520 --> 47:02.560]  seen it was a process but if you haven't become disgusted with the world by the
[47:02.560 --> 47:09.560]  time you're 18 19 20 years old and haven't started turning the ship in the
[47:09.560 --> 47:18.040]  other direction there's something wrong with you and I talk a lot about this but
[47:18.040 --> 47:24.400]  I never have the words to describe it I mean we are on a planet and the life on
[47:24.400 --> 47:33.480]  that planet the fertile fields the mountains the lakes the streams the
[47:33.480 --> 47:45.000]  forests the meadows the badlands the oceans the valleys the rain forest the
[47:45.000 --> 48:00.000]  jungles the frozen tundra and the atmosphere all 15,000 of the breathable
[48:00.000 --> 48:13.960]  atmosphere all of that is thinner than the skin of an apple we live on a giant
[48:13.960 --> 48:25.920]  planetoid with a molten center of nickel magnetized with floating islands of rock
[48:25.920 --> 48:38.920]  on which we sail and out from the planet is an endless
[48:39.920 --> 48:45.800]  cornucopia of possibilities billions and billions of galaxies photographed by
[48:45.800 --> 48:57.920]  Hubble alone the Sun a distant star warms your skin in the morning yet gives
[48:57.920 --> 49:04.720]  the energy to the plants to grow that then gives us substance and produces
[49:04.720 --> 49:12.320]  seeds to generate life anew the seas filled with hundreds of thousands of
[49:12.320 --> 49:20.000]  different forms of life just teeming teeming from the single cell organism up
[49:20.000 --> 49:27.200]  to the blue whale all of it just endless wonder you know you have a sense of
[49:27.200 --> 49:32.240]  always being here because you're alive you're conscious now but you have to
[49:32.240 --> 49:41.440]  remember before you came infinity and after you comes infinity and the
[49:41.440 --> 49:47.600]  control freak you're Genesis tell the world that there is no God there is no
[49:47.600 --> 49:53.440]  spirituality there is no wonderment we're all just blobs of tissue we don't
[49:53.440 --> 50:00.520]  control ourselves we don't have free will we don't have any destiny and that's
[50:00.520 --> 50:08.280]  the fraud your your your very gut tells you that look at how humans can see a
[50:08.280 --> 50:19.320]  sunset or how humans can appreciate the beauty of a forest or a nicely set
[50:19.320 --> 50:25.400]  table with a flower arrangement you know we don't just see we we see the
[50:25.400 --> 50:30.960]  universe we see its beauty we love it we are part of it we are of it and we do
[50:30.960 --> 50:39.320]  have free will to do good and bad we know good and bad establishments biggest
[50:39.320 --> 50:44.880]  lies and tell you there is no good and bad there is no right and wrong so they
[50:44.880 --> 50:49.320]  tell you just run off and be an animal satiate yourself and we the technocrats
[50:49.320 --> 50:53.800]  we will control the future and then you look into that future we're not part of
[50:53.800 --> 51:00.840]  it so I tell you seize control of your own destiny your calls are coming up hey

[54:19.880 --> 54:26.200]  mama deception you name it infowars.com and burn a whole bunch of copies of
[54:26.200 --> 54:29.880]  them and give them to people and it's having a huge effect and I want to
[54:29.880 --> 54:34.240]  commend all the out there that are doing that later the big censorship
[54:34.240 --> 54:38.280]  information coming up let's go to your calls right now Kevin Joey John Kathy
[54:38.280 --> 54:41.480]  Ray and others let's go ahead and talk to Kevin Kevin you're on the air
[54:41.480 --> 54:47.120]  welcome hey how's it going Alex good sir well I've been thinking about this
[54:47.120 --> 54:50.320]  subject for quite a while and I'm sure that you've done much more research than
[54:50.320 --> 54:55.920]  I have and I want to ask you because undoubtedly the government stands to
[54:55.920 --> 55:00.680]  make a lot of money or benefit from the vaccines for swine flu I was wondering
[55:00.680 --> 55:06.200]  just how much they would benefit from it well I mean there's a lot of different
[55:06.200 --> 55:10.600]  things that the government wants to set the precedent for forcible injections
[55:10.600 --> 55:16.240]  they have the executive orders and the laws but that's like passing a law that
[55:16.240 --> 55:22.160]  you know all black people have to wear a yellow dunce hat it's obviously racist
[55:22.160 --> 55:27.800]  and wrong and against the organic common law or you know saying all white
[55:27.800 --> 55:32.280]  people have to chop their left finger you know their left-hand pinky off I
[55:32.280 --> 55:36.440]  mean it's it's a fraud it's a lie so to try to say the government can forcibly
[55:36.440 --> 55:40.440]  inject you with what we want when we want their argument is then well it's for
[55:40.440 --> 55:43.160]  the greater good well let's look at what governments have done in the past
[55:43.160 --> 55:47.800]  eugenics sterilizing people with vaccines poisoning people let's look at
[55:47.800 --> 55:51.440]  the history of the vaccines how deadly they are how poisonous they are and by
[55:51.440 --> 55:56.240]  the way it's not by accident it's been proven to be by design so they set the
[55:56.240 --> 56:00.880]  precedent for this police state to put in your body what they want and set that
[56:00.880 --> 56:06.040]  precedent so that's the main reason they're pushing all this fair mongering
[56:06.040 --> 56:10.200]  then these companies can make hundreds of billions of dollars I mean can you
[56:10.200 --> 56:15.520]  imagine having all of us in Europe in the United States roughly 600 million
[56:15.520 --> 56:22.280]  people you know pay 20 30 40 dollars for these vaccines Obama wants to push
[56:22.280 --> 56:26.880]  that everybody start taking three flu shots a year that's in the Washington
[56:26.880 --> 56:32.880]  Post yesterday I've got that in my stack I mean this this is serious and then
[56:32.880 --> 56:36.640]  also there's the police state function of the federalization they get to
[56:36.640 --> 56:41.240]  practice federal takeover of the states and counties and cities and the feds
[56:41.240 --> 56:45.600]  themselves admit they're under United Nations response they're under World
[56:45.600 --> 56:50.160]  Health Organization directives following orders from them and the UN came out in
[56:50.160 --> 56:53.680]  a bunch of statements the last two weeks saying this has been a great drill you
[56:53.680 --> 56:58.160]  know this is great for global governance so those are the basic reasons why they
[56:58.160 --> 57:03.640]  like to fair monger all this oh thanks a lot I had no idea I appreciate your
[57:03.640 --> 57:07.200]  call Kevin it's really good to hear from you and I respect the fact that you
[57:07.200 --> 57:12.360]  care enough to even listen to the show and want to be involved in society Joey
[57:12.360 --> 57:18.800]  in Florida Joey you're on the air go ahead Alex are you doing good good to
[57:18.800 --> 57:23.440]  talk to you good to talk to you first of all I've had my eyes opened about a
[57:23.440 --> 57:27.360]  month and a half ago I watched the Obama deception with my friend Spencer and my
[57:27.360 --> 57:34.200]  girlfriend blew me down blew me down and right now in West Palm Beach Florida we

[1:00:46.320 --> 1:00:50.080]  you were making a point about how you guys started a myspace to promote with
[1:00:50.080 --> 1:00:57.320]  this radio shows doing that people are watching their freedoms get eroded in
[1:00:57.320 --> 1:01:01.120]  front of their face and they're more worried about who's going to superbowl
[1:01:01.120 --> 1:01:05.520]  or there's bloodline line it's like what's wrong with you people it's our
[1:01:05.520 --> 1:01:10.400]  freedoms have been eroding I would say they are collapsing now I mean it you
[1:01:10.400 --> 1:01:15.000]  know it's kind of like when a building starts teetering all of a sudden just
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:21.520]  collapses it is now starting to collapse and they're just boldly coming right
[1:01:21.520 --> 1:01:26.880]  out and doing it now but go ahead I mean I watched the 9-11 Chronicles this
[1:01:26.880 --> 1:01:33.280]  morning and I mean I'm in tears like you know you find yourself questioning
[1:01:33.280 --> 1:01:37.440]  everything that's happened but what you have is facts and I mean you have no
[1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:43.440]  other agenda but to wake people up the police and the firemen are dying
[1:01:43.440 --> 1:01:48.400]  thousands and thousands of them had died by the time we made that film about it
[1:01:48.400 --> 1:01:53.840]  now it's been out close to a year and most of it was shot a year ago and here
[1:01:53.840 --> 1:01:57.840]  we are just going to Congress trying to expose that they knew the dust was
[1:01:57.840 --> 1:02:00.840]  deadly the asbestos and all of it didn't give them treatment and then they have
[1:02:00.840 --> 1:02:05.680]  cops coming up threatening to say they have bombs when they're protesting
[1:02:05.680 --> 1:02:10.800]  trying to get cops health care that is mind control you know when I say that
[1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:19.760]  this system hurts 99% of us it does and and you know the firemen and police a
[1:02:19.760 --> 1:02:23.560]  lot of them are fans and appreciate us but there's a big percentage of them
[1:02:23.560 --> 1:02:30.200]  that are so rabid on a power trip with the New World Order that they'll do
[1:02:30.200 --> 1:02:34.160]  whatever they're told and you know to the point of throwing their own children
[1:02:34.160 --> 1:02:38.160]  out of window and rather are running off a cliff you know the old thing of would
[1:02:38.160 --> 1:02:42.480]  you run off a cliff of somebody told you to they would they would run off a
[1:02:42.480 --> 1:02:46.720]  cliff if they were told to do it and that is I just don't think they realize
[1:02:46.720 --> 1:02:51.480]  what they've done and I'm not blaming it on police I'm saying it's all part of
[1:02:51.480 --> 1:02:55.920]  this lying society that's delusional we rash I mean look we've killed 50 million
[1:02:55.920 --> 1:02:59.600]  babies and even if you don't and even if you think we're animals we don't have a
[1:02:59.600 --> 1:03:06.120]  soul you know which is a fraud that is really sick and gross to think so little
[1:03:06.120 --> 1:03:11.880]  of our species you know that lazily for contraceptives people have a dangerous
[1:03:11.880 --> 1:03:16.600]  bloody procedure done that endangers their own life and doubles their chances
[1:03:16.600 --> 1:03:26.040]  of getting cervical or uterine cancer it doubles it totally messes a woman up to
[1:03:26.040 --> 1:03:31.640]  to unnaturally terminated a abortion I mean to have an abortion and kill a
[1:03:31.640 --> 1:03:36.440]  baby but anyways go ahead anything else sir there's something like there's
[1:03:36.440 --> 1:03:39.960]  certain times where like you know you couldn't blame someone for turning to
[1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:43.960]  that route but the thing is that like you know it's too much they're letting
[1:03:43.960 --> 1:03:47.840]  people feel like you know they could just dump them off you know like just go
[1:03:47.840 --> 1:03:53.440]  for broke and it's just you know it's disgusting you know but it's what
[1:03:53.440 --> 1:03:58.200]  people get fed on the TV all the time and what people get fed from Fox and TV
[1:03:58.200 --> 1:04:03.360]  you know it makes people you know it's like it's like Rome you know do the
[1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:06.840]  Romans you see people you know banging and going crazy on the TV what are you
[1:04:06.840 --> 1:04:12.200]  gonna do that you know you let me see I appreciate your call yeah what they're
[1:04:12.200 --> 1:04:18.480]  doing is using peer pressure psychology you know if one of my dogs sees the other
[1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:21.840]  dog jump up and start running someplace it's gonna jump up and go run to see
[1:04:21.840 --> 1:04:25.680]  what's happening it's the very nature of our species we're very similar to dogs
[1:04:25.680 --> 1:04:31.800]  in our social behavior and but we have to rise above that and rise above the
[1:04:31.800 --> 1:04:38.360]  programming and realize the con game realize the mind control and and
[1:04:38.360 --> 1:04:43.320]  realizing it is half the battle but you got to have the courage folks because
[1:04:43.320 --> 1:04:48.960]  when you face that you're living in a matrix of disinformation then you've
[1:04:48.960 --> 1:04:52.960]  got to start learning what the real world is and it's very beautiful but
[1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:58.840]  it's also very ugly I just want people to open up their minds and think for
[1:04:58.840 --> 1:05:03.360]  themselves more calls straight ahead hello this is Steve shank you might not

[1:08:06.960 --> 1:08:13.680]  war continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[1:08:20.760 --> 1:08:25.680]  I have just come off one of the longest
[1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:34.440]  continuum old events in my life where I have just been working so intentionally
[1:08:34.440 --> 1:08:41.760]  and so hard that I would just collapse when I went to bed at one or two every
[1:08:41.760 --> 1:08:49.320]  night and it almost becomes a drug when you're working that hard and that
[1:08:49.320 --> 1:08:55.160]  focused then I did 17 days straight of my own radio show and two or three other
[1:08:55.160 --> 1:09:04.040]  interviews a day and I physically didn't feel tired but that happens usually
[1:09:04.040 --> 1:09:09.800]  about once or twice a year when I get that exhausted and so I took off three
[1:09:09.800 --> 1:09:19.120]  days for days total I guess I don't know Thursday through Sunday four days and it
[1:09:19.120 --> 1:09:30.360]  was just such a rejuvenating experience to unplug from everything I still
[1:09:30.360 --> 1:09:33.560]  couldn't get away from big brother and I'm gonna cover that in the last hour or
[1:09:33.560 --> 1:09:43.040]  the New World Order but it was good to slow down very very good and I think
[1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:45.920]  I'm gonna do it again coming up in the next few weeks and you know I think
[1:09:45.920 --> 1:09:49.400]  it's important for everybody to do that I know it's been set a trillion times
[1:09:49.400 --> 1:09:54.040]  and it's good to take a break sometimes and be reflective you know a lot of
[1:09:54.040 --> 1:09:59.800]  people philosophers engineers researchers a lot of people that do
[1:09:59.800 --> 1:10:06.520]  brainwork they'll go off for month-long retreats sometimes and I don't have that
[1:10:06.520 --> 1:10:17.160]  luxury because the war is so intense but it was just such a reflective time and
[1:10:17.160 --> 1:10:24.880]  and and so many revelations and so many understandings that I had and also great
[1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:31.120]  peace you know I've been able to fire myself up and get get aggressive and
[1:10:31.120 --> 1:10:34.960]  stare into the face of the stuff we deal with I mean what we talk about is real
[1:10:34.960 --> 1:10:38.520]  folks the New World Order is real they really are killing people knowingly with
[1:10:38.520 --> 1:10:42.440]  vaccines they really are setting up a world government to carry out eugenics
[1:10:42.440 --> 1:10:46.160]  and world population reduction all the horrible things we've seen the last
[1:10:46.160 --> 1:10:50.920]  century were only beta test and it's all on record you know even if you don't
[1:10:50.920 --> 1:10:55.360]  believe me you have to believe the facts of what the establishment states and I
[1:10:55.360 --> 1:10:59.840]  kind of get fired up and get aggressive and we're ready and at a primitive
[1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:05.000]  level that's been very successful and I and I'll still get fired up here on
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:15.760]  air but I tend to work hard all the time because I know the time is short and
[1:11:15.760 --> 1:11:22.480]  enemies moving on us but also because it keeps my mind off anxieties dealing with
[1:11:22.480 --> 1:11:27.120]  this how precious and good my children are the threats they've received not
[1:11:27.120 --> 1:11:35.480]  just my wife and I and I think about really how sorry I am for the people
[1:11:35.480 --> 1:11:41.760]  that work for the system who have turned themselves into what they are that
[1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:45.680]  they can do the type of things they do in fact last week I told you guys to
[1:11:45.680 --> 1:11:49.760]  find the congressional defense budget hearings about child kidnapping rings
[1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:56.960]  and you found it remember that it was like Donald Rumsfeld Dinecore Halliburton
[1:11:56.960 --> 1:12:04.880]  child kidnapping rings you actually found the clip and I never played it I'm
[1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:09.800]  gonna play that later in the hour Jaren you remember you found that I saw it on
[1:12:09.800 --> 1:12:14.960]  screen do you have that yeah we'll get it back play it next hour and we have
[1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:22.760]  more simulcasting at prisonplanet.tv and stuff like that really shakes me to
[1:12:22.760 --> 1:12:36.320]  the core because you know you might feel sorry for a mad dog that has rabies
[1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:41.600]  foaming at the mouth coming down your street but at the same time you got to
[1:12:41.600 --> 1:12:52.800]  go out the street with your rifle and put it down I mean these really are
[1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:57.560]  pitiful people they compete with each other over who's the most ruthless who's
[1:12:57.560 --> 1:13:09.080]  the most cunning who sees humanity as hamburger as food as food on the table
[1:13:09.080 --> 1:13:13.280]  now their lives matter and their children matter but the rest of us were
[1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:18.520]  animals here to be called here to be fed on
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:36.280]  here to have our lives be used up like so many resources and the globalists
[1:13:36.280 --> 1:13:40.560]  talk about that you know they say we're just animals and it's survival of the
[1:13:40.560 --> 1:13:45.760]  fittest social Darwinism that it's okay what Hitler did and what Stalin did and
[1:13:45.760 --> 1:13:49.880]  what Mounted and what Pol Pot did and it's okay all these horrible things
[1:13:49.880 --> 1:13:53.320]  governments have done because it might makes right if you're in power that's
[1:13:53.320 --> 1:14:01.160]  means you're in a social Darwinistic sense the best and so it's your right to
[1:14:01.160 --> 1:14:13.400]  do that but I use the analogy of cancer is it cancers right to run through the
[1:14:13.400 --> 1:14:19.160]  body and cause death because it replicates faster it doesn't follow the
[1:14:19.160 --> 1:14:27.280]  regular program no it is a aberrant malfunction it is fallen it doesn't
[1:14:27.280 --> 1:14:34.320]  produce strong vibrant dynamic uplifting beautiful societies freedom and
[1:14:34.320 --> 1:14:41.800]  liberty does darkness begets death and destruction
[1:14:49.560 --> 1:14:54.240]  and the establishment knows there is good and evil they talk about how they're
[1:14:54.240 --> 1:15:00.360]  beyond good evil but they know they are of the cloth that we would call evil they
[1:15:00.360 --> 1:15:06.960]  would call strong dominant and so they kill a million 300,000 Iraqis they kill
[1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:11.520]  500,000 kids here in the US with abortion what is it if the cop tasers you
[1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:15.880]  to death or cop shoots you in the back what is it if they euthanize old people
[1:15:15.880 --> 1:15:19.600]  where does it in there where does it stop it doesn't if it's for the earth go
[1:15:19.600 --> 1:15:24.040]  ahead and kill the majority of us but it is they aren't killing they aren't setting
[1:15:24.040 --> 1:15:26.280]  up world government to call the population because they care about the
[1:15:26.280 --> 1:15:30.480]  environment the elites are actually busy playing God remaking the environment
[1:15:30.480 --> 1:15:34.280]  they're killing and wiping people out because their control freaks and it's
[1:15:34.280 --> 1:15:40.440]  their nature and they enjoy it and they are challenged by good people they are

[1:15:49.120 --> 1:15:57.200]  their monopoly of power so they want a new dark age with sequestered coveted

[1:17:46.200 --> 1:17:51.000]  the way things are going to Pakistan where the Taliban supposedly taken over
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  slowly almost seems like they're getting a set up to set a new cough in this
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:58.200]  country and then blaming on a Taliban and then they can launch an all-out war
[1:17:58.200 --> 1:18:02.560]  across the Middle East and create a police state totally in our country right
[1:18:02.560 --> 1:18:09.360]  here overnight yeah I would know of I mean I've been saying for the last six
[1:18:09.360 --> 1:18:15.280]  months that I see Pakistan being where they want to start a new war that I see
[1:18:15.280 --> 1:18:20.040]  Georgia as a place to start another one which they almost did last week and that
[1:18:20.040 --> 1:18:25.280]  that I would see a biological event whether a hoax or a real event and I
[1:18:25.280 --> 1:18:31.920]  predicted that March 5th in detail a few months ago and it could be in concert
[1:18:31.920 --> 1:18:36.880]  with a nuke going off there is they've got a vicious set of cards in their hand
[1:18:36.880 --> 1:18:42.200]  and any one of the cards is devastating to liberty and centralizes power and
[1:18:42.200 --> 1:18:48.240]  control for them but I see them playing a five or six big cards they've got they
[1:18:48.240 --> 1:18:55.320]  could play the entire fist full of cards go ahead well I mean it's fine flu
[1:18:55.320 --> 1:18:59.560]  deal was obviously a bio attack I don't know why it seemed like a peter it out
[1:18:59.560 --> 1:19:02.360]  when I got here I don't know what the what their motive was for it if they
[1:19:02.360 --> 1:19:07.600]  meant it to be just a mediocre flu virus or if it was just something like a
[1:19:07.600 --> 1:19:11.720]  dud firecracker when I got here you know I was I was gonna ask you about that
[1:19:11.720 --> 1:19:16.240]  what do you think that why they launched this it was a tracker test to test how

[1:23:59.600 --> 1:24:23.600]  today
[1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:28.400]  let's talk to Ray oh I said I'd answer that last caller's question I'm gonna
[1:24:28.400 --> 1:24:36.680]  read Colorado Rod Nuthers look it's clearly a engineered a virus we've
[1:24:36.680 --> 1:24:42.960]  gone over all the reasons why it's clearly meant to track the spread of
[1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:49.040]  the virus we've talked to virologist and after we reported this I make the
[1:24:49.040 --> 1:24:52.560]  point that we're not making the stuff up and later comes out the media they're
[1:24:52.560 --> 1:24:57.320]  saying it could be the perfect virus the way it's designed to combine with new
[1:24:57.320 --> 1:25:05.600]  DNA RNA to be technical strands that would then infect humans more readily and
[1:25:05.600 --> 1:25:13.360]  be even more deadly and it's its spread rate that was so frightening to people
[1:25:13.360 --> 1:25:17.280]  and now the World Health Organization saying two billion people have been
[1:25:17.280 --> 1:25:24.200]  infected with it so a lot of fear mongering there and hey you know if the
[1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:31.200]  news comes out even when they're crying wolf and says ABC News missiles have
[1:25:31.200 --> 1:25:34.400]  been fired from Russia we'll let you know in the next five minutes what's
[1:25:34.400 --> 1:25:41.160]  happened as they did in 2000 we're gonna cover it and say well probably just
[1:25:41.160 --> 1:25:44.840]  fear mongering sigh up but it's our responsibility to tell you these
[1:25:44.840 --> 1:25:51.640]  globalist are mass killers and so we're gonna discuss it as the same thing when
[1:25:51.640 --> 1:25:54.520]  they come out and say this could kill tens of millions greatest threat
[1:25:54.520 --> 1:26:00.000]  humanities faced in 90 years forced inoculation martial law may be needed
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:04.320]  we went on air and said probably a hoax probably a beta test but they could do it
[1:26:04.320 --> 1:26:10.120]  for real folks just like when Air Force One flew to the middle of Manhattan
[1:26:10.120 --> 1:26:15.520]  during all of that clearly trying to connect somehow 9-11 to bird flu in
[1:26:15.520 --> 1:26:22.640]  swine flu in people's minds it was clearly done to create some type of panic
[1:26:22.640 --> 1:26:27.560]  to try to re-invoke fears and I said there's no way the feds didn't know
[1:26:27.560 --> 1:26:30.560]  about that there's no way they didn't know that would cause a panic and then it
[1:26:30.560 --> 1:26:33.840]  came out they knew it would cause a panic and said it's secret don't tell the
[1:26:33.840 --> 1:26:37.080]  public and then then they said it was a photo off but they won't release the
[1:26:37.080 --> 1:26:42.360]  photos when they could have photoshopped it Charlie Sheen called me up to make
[1:26:42.360 --> 1:26:45.200]  that point I hadn't thought of that he goes Alex they could have just photoshopped
[1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:51.360]  that this is some Psyop I said I agree with you buddy what a weird world just
[1:26:51.360 --> 1:26:56.200]  don't want to give credit to where that up point came from
[1:26:56.200 --> 1:27:02.360]  all right let's go back to the calls here let's talk to Ray in Colorado Ray go
[1:27:02.360 --> 1:27:08.040]  ahead hi Alex how are you today I'm just really doing great Ray I was gonna say I
[1:27:08.040 --> 1:27:12.000]  I'm not sure it's the verse you want but it's the second Timothy chapter 3 you
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:15.960]  might want to look that chapter up for all your descriptions of evil men and
[1:27:15.960 --> 1:27:19.680]  imposters but I just wanted to talk about Rita to us and then I'll hold you
[1:27:19.680 --> 1:27:24.080]  over but do you have the passage in front of us well just do it's kind of a
[1:27:24.080 --> 1:27:27.720]  one two three four five six kind of stuff but I'll just do real fast it says
[1:27:27.720 --> 1:27:32.000]  but realize this in the last days difficult times will come for men will
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:37.200]  be lovers of self lovers of money boastful arrogant revilers disobedient to
[1:27:37.200 --> 1:27:42.720]  parents ungrateful unholy unloving irreconcilable malicious gossips without
[1:27:42.720 --> 1:27:47.600]  self-control brutal haters of good treacherous reckless conceited lovers
[1:27:47.600 --> 1:27:52.680]  of pleasure rather than lovers of God and then go down evil men and imposters
[1:27:52.680 --> 1:27:57.880]  will proceed from bad to worse deceiving and being deceived and to me that is the
[1:27:57.880 --> 1:28:02.400]  dark spirit that permeates all this worldwide destruction and yes I know
[1:28:02.400 --> 1:28:06.160]  those passages and I think the most powerful in the Bible and there's
[1:28:06.160 --> 1:28:10.080]  another one it was there after their father you know the devil the father of
[1:28:10.080 --> 1:28:15.720]  lies but there's another one that they love death and they do they love death
[1:28:15.720 --> 1:28:20.000]  they did and I'm just in love with life because they're so jealous and envious of
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:25.600]  anybody's strength you know I mean so many old folks in the past reading
[1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:30.000]  history and talking people would revel in young people and love the youth and
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:35.160]  and love the future now on old folks hate the young hate their hate their
[1:28:35.160 --> 1:28:39.520]  energy the the young hate the old and see them as ugly and bad and not having
[1:28:39.520 --> 1:28:44.400]  wisdom and it's it's just an end and then this idea that children are bad and
[1:28:44.400 --> 1:28:48.560]  one of the greatest gift ever I mean it's and then people are totally unhappy
[1:28:48.560 --> 1:28:53.880]  because evil does not fulfill you it only makes you hunger more and more when
[1:28:53.880 --> 1:28:58.280]  goodness literally feeds the soul and and I'm sorry for those that never
[1:28:58.280 --> 1:29:02.880]  experienced it that you know when they laugh at us all these unhappy atheists
[1:29:02.880 --> 1:29:05.680]  and psychologists and psychiatrists that are all out there talking about how
[1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:09.240]  horrible their lives are and their incredible rates of suicide they're
[1:29:09.240 --> 1:29:15.240]  not fulfilled because they don't realize the wonderment of what it is to be alive
[1:29:15.240 --> 1:29:19.960]  go ahead I just say Alex and I have I could make lots of points like it like
[1:29:19.960 --> 1:29:24.840]  everyone else but I had just read today I was just gonna call and talk about the
[1:29:24.840 --> 1:29:28.920]  Nazi thing that I've been reading about and here I hear Paul Watson's gonna talk

[1:32:57.760 --> 1:33:14.240]  is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[1:33:14.240 --> 1:33:39.840]  it's a new kind of charity, a new kind of war run by psychiatrists and psychologists and sociologists as they track and trace our every move our activities as they gauge our responses as they drug our water supplies spray our skies fill our food full of poisons as they try to intoxicate the world
[1:33:39.840 --> 1:33:54.800]  entertainment, over the counter drugs, prescription drugs, illegal drugs, like Aztec priests, forcing narcotic drinks down the throat of the sacrifice victims so they won't resist
[1:33:54.800 --> 1:34:04.560]  that is what's happening right now oh yeah they get you drunk as a skunk where they took you up to the chopping block so you wouldn't
[1:34:04.560 --> 1:34:10.080]  wouldn't flail they did the same thing in the camps in Germany and the camps in
[1:34:10.080 --> 1:34:14.920]  Russia with the sodium fluoride in the water historical fact the public would
[1:34:14.920 --> 1:34:20.560]  have to face the horror of who's in control so they deny, deny and then that
[1:34:20.560 --> 1:34:26.920]  allows the evil to continue and grow and win because the cowards believe that by
[1:34:26.920 --> 1:34:33.640]  denying reality they're safe instead of facing they really are monsters we've
[1:34:33.640 --> 1:34:40.840]  met them and it's our own species an aberrant group within our own species
[1:34:40.840 --> 1:34:46.880]  engaging in predatory activity against the rest of the species and in the
[1:34:46.880 --> 1:34:54.080]  process losing their own souls going back to Ray and then Rod and others Ray
[1:34:54.080 --> 1:34:57.160]  you were trying to make a point but I kept interrupting go ahead that's all
[1:34:57.160 --> 1:35:02.200]  right I was just going to remind you that when G20 was just in London the Queen
[1:35:02.200 --> 1:35:08.160]  gave out Orwells 1984 to several of the attendants there and Jim Mars in his rise
[1:35:08.160 --> 1:35:14.200]  of the Fourth Reich has clearly shown all the Nazi relationships in Europe and
[1:35:14.200 --> 1:35:19.960]  America and other places and to me Alex just to make it easy for people who
[1:35:19.960 --> 1:35:27.080]  don't understand all this just read Orwells 1984 or Huxley's Brave New
[1:35:27.080 --> 1:35:32.440]  World and that is what they're implementing and when you go back to the
[1:35:32.440 --> 1:35:38.760]  Nazi and Islamic coalition that was in all through World War one and two it is
[1:35:38.760 --> 1:35:44.680]  still being fomented yeah the Arab League that's exactly what happened is
[1:35:44.680 --> 1:35:50.200]  the right-wing Arab groups funded by the Nazis were then picked up by mi-5 mi-6
[1:35:50.200 --> 1:35:54.640]  CIA on record I mean Kermit Roosevelt wrote a book about it the CIA section
[1:35:54.640 --> 1:35:59.920]  chief published in 1999 shortly before his death and I've had top CIA people on
[1:35:59.920 --> 1:36:02.600]  air and I bring them they go yeah you shouldn't have published that they're
[1:36:02.600 --> 1:36:06.600]  very upset about how they use radical Muslims to stage terror attacks they
[1:36:06.600 --> 1:36:12.880]  were just talking on national television was it NBC this Sunday to the president
[1:36:12.880 --> 1:36:16.880]  of Pakistan and he said oh some of them lot and works for you he's staging the
[1:36:16.880 --> 1:36:21.560]  terror attacks that he stabilized our country the radical Muslims you know how
[1:36:21.560 --> 1:36:25.840]  dare you blame us for radical Muslims you you know the West is using them to
[1:36:25.840 --> 1:36:30.960]  destabilize Pakistan which is completely true I mean you know they use the
[1:36:30.960 --> 1:36:35.400]  radical Muslims to go after the Serbs they use the radical Muslims to go after
[1:36:35.400 --> 1:36:40.400]  the African nations they use the radical Muslim I mean look at Odinga
[1:36:40.400 --> 1:36:45.680]  Obama's cousin first cousin and then we have the mainstream news with the memos
[1:36:45.680 --> 1:36:51.320]  when he was a US senator Obama's office advising Odinga how to have the Muslims
[1:36:51.320 --> 1:36:58.200]  riot as the minority to take over and come to destroy the the Republic there
[1:36:58.200 --> 1:37:04.480]  and the duly elected government in Kenya I mean look radical Muslims work for 10
[1:37:04.480 --> 1:37:08.200]  Downing Street in the White House period and you know that's the more
[1:37:08.200 --> 1:37:13.360]  sophisticated worldview that we put out that isn't this simple US good Muslims
[1:37:13.360 --> 1:37:18.560]  bad Muslims bad US good we try to break down the more sophisticated model and
[1:37:18.560 --> 1:37:25.080]  yes my mother you know I went to college for history I gave her a copy of Rise
[1:37:25.080 --> 1:37:29.840]  and Fall of the third right many years ago and she'd already read it but I
[1:37:29.840 --> 1:37:35.360]  finally gave her a book she hadn't read and that was the fourth right by Jim
[1:37:35.360 --> 1:37:40.560]  Mars that we carry discounted at info wars.com and she had literally read
[1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:44.640]  hundreds of books on World War two I mean she reads one like every week she's
[1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:51.720]  she's the last few years been you know on that track and she said no knowing all
[1:37:51.720 --> 1:37:56.560]  the history she knew it just brought so many pieces together of Jim Mars' amazing
[1:37:56.560 --> 1:38:01.600]  book and then when you look at it you know then you've got this crowd that says
[1:38:01.600 --> 1:38:04.960]  all the Nazis don't run anything there's no such thing as Nazis well when you
[1:38:04.960 --> 1:38:08.760]  understand that it came from the US in England and the Nazis implemented a
[1:38:08.760 --> 1:38:14.520]  eugenics policy and we're basically then set up by the Anglo-American Nazis to
[1:38:14.520 --> 1:38:19.240]  fall they then allowed that system to go underground to the European Union and
[1:38:19.240 --> 1:38:22.280]  that's now been declassified we already knew that but now it's mainstream news
[1:38:22.280 --> 1:38:28.360]  Paul Watson's coming up and that's the system today is a worldwide eugenics
[1:38:28.360 --> 1:38:35.440]  operation it's not proper to call it Nazi because the Nazis were like a spin-off
[1:38:35.440 --> 1:38:42.760]  you know they were like a subsidiary or a minor league of the big leagues okay in
[1:38:42.760 --> 1:38:47.740]  baseball you know you so so that's what we're talking about here but anyways
[1:38:47.740 --> 1:38:51.840]  finish your point say that's the dark spirit behind the whole thing they use
[1:38:51.840 --> 1:38:57.080]  everybody I mean nobody is exempt from being used by this dark spirit and I'm
[1:38:57.080 --> 1:39:02.360]  just gonna say this is just like in our current situation is just like 9-11 this
[1:39:02.360 --> 1:39:07.880]  is a thermite meltdown of the world and it's all preplanned absolutely God God
[1:39:07.880 --> 1:39:12.560]  bless you take care and have those vacations no I thank you that was it was
[1:39:12.560 --> 1:39:19.760]  great very reflective very just good for the soul now
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:23.920]  there's a lot of things coming to a head though I've been I've been really
[1:39:23.920 --> 1:39:28.160]  finally so I'll start exercising for a few weeks and quit or I'll stay healthy
[1:39:28.160 --> 1:39:32.200]  for a month or so and then quit and I'm actually now about a month and a half
[1:39:32.200 --> 1:39:37.000]  into working out every day and eating healthy every day and getting sleep
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:46.840]  almost every day and just praying and trying to be a better person and in
[1:39:46.840 --> 1:39:50.960]  trying to really get centered and it's it's it just gets better and better
[1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:58.920]  folks and I'm totally prepared for whatever comes I just can't imagine
[1:39:58.920 --> 1:40:03.960]  people that aren't tapped into the universe aren't tapped into the wider
[1:40:03.960 --> 1:40:10.920]  realm who are just so with blinders looking just just tiny little area about
[1:40:10.920 --> 1:40:15.360]  they want a new truck or how to act cool at the gym or you know fighting with
[1:40:15.360 --> 1:40:18.680]  their wife or husband all these petty issues or all these women that feel
[1:40:18.680 --> 1:40:23.280]  inadequate and think they're ugly no matter how gorgeous they are Madison
[1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:27.240]  Avenue totally programmed them and I just see people under the mind control
[1:40:27.240 --> 1:40:31.320]  you know their mannerisms their body language the way they talk the the
[1:40:31.320 --> 1:40:37.600]  insecurity who's got time for insecurity when we're all gonna die none of us are
[1:40:37.600 --> 1:40:42.480]  gonna make it out of this we are living sentient creative beings who have not
[1:40:42.480 --> 1:40:48.960]  even begun to discover our true potential and our true destiny and I can see
[1:40:48.960 --> 1:40:55.360]  that destiny I I I can you know primitive as I am and and small as I am
[1:40:55.360 --> 1:41:01.960]  compared to what the species is going to become I can grasp it from afar you know
[1:41:01.960 --> 1:41:06.600]  the promised land and I can tell you it is beautiful and wondrous beyond your
[1:41:06.600 --> 1:41:12.680]  imaginings and then to throw myself against this wicked stinking machine
[1:41:12.680 --> 1:41:21.120]  you know that smells like a smells like a giant pile of dead bodies I mean we've
[1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:24.000]  got to defend the innocent we got to defend the species we've got to defend
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:28.960]  the DNA you notice the first thing the new world order does is go after the
[1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:38.680]  DNA I mean it is a fact that Eugenicist founded Cold Springs Harbor where now
[1:41:38.680 --> 1:41:43.040]  IBM with the US government runs the human genome project and all other major
[1:41:43.040 --> 1:41:47.480]  directors you can just look at the the the directorship of the human genome
[1:41:47.480 --> 1:41:52.440]  project and then you can search their names under Planned Parenthood under
[1:41:52.440 --> 1:42:00.240]  Eugenics under the optimum population groups and they are all hard core blacks
[1:42:00.240 --> 1:42:05.400]  aren't humans we got to kill 80% of people the you know the future doesn't
[1:42:05.400 --> 1:42:13.080]  need a big population every and you search Google and you research all the
[1:42:13.080 --> 1:42:17.880]  big fortune 100 and you research Chase Manhattan and you research Goldman
[1:42:17.880 --> 1:42:26.200]  Sachs and you research IBM and Microsoft and it's all Eugenics every some of you
[1:42:26.200 --> 1:42:32.240]  look at Frank Paulson gives almost all the hundreds of millions of dollars he
[1:42:32.240 --> 1:42:40.040]  makes literally almost everything lives frugally I mean he isn't into money or
[1:42:40.040 --> 1:42:43.360]  power he isn't worldly in the sense you think you know that's kind of the
[1:42:43.360 --> 1:42:47.440]  their servants are into bobbles and trinkets and stuff at the top they are
[1:42:47.440 --> 1:42:52.040]  just as committed as we are folks and he just gives everything he's got to
[1:42:52.040 --> 1:42:56.680]  Eugenics funds and sterilization funds and vaccine funds and land grabbing
[1:42:56.680 --> 1:43:01.960]  funds and he's just and they just work dedicated 18 hours a day dedicated
[1:43:01.960 --> 1:43:06.720]  dedicated to bring you evil dedicated to bankrupt the middle class because and
[1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:10.080]  they say because we're consuming too much we've got it too too well I mean I
[1:43:10.080 --> 1:43:15.240]  probably heard NPR 200 times because it's all the you know my wife always
[1:43:15.240 --> 1:43:19.800]  listens to it you know when she's cooking dinner like 530 and this morning she
[1:43:19.800 --> 1:43:23.600]  had it on I get about 730 and I hear in the room next to me cooking breakfast
[1:43:23.600 --> 1:43:30.400]  and it's on and I and I hear him talk about world population and greenhouse
[1:43:30.400 --> 1:43:36.080]  taxes and all this crap and it's just it's just never ends and I know what it
[1:43:36.080 --> 1:43:42.920]  is and I know how they have that sweet calm soothing NPR voice and I know that
[1:43:42.920 --> 1:43:47.800]  they have college courses and they admit that they go to them to speak calmly
[1:43:47.800 --> 1:43:52.240]  it's just like when you come up to a horse and you've got it in the
[1:43:52.240 --> 1:43:56.360]  domestication pen you've been feeding it and you've been coming up kind of
[1:43:56.360 --> 1:44:00.320]  getting ready to put a bridle on the last few weeks and you're shh shh shh
[1:44:00.320 --> 1:44:06.760]  everything's okay horsey there you go let me give you some feed out of my
[1:44:06.760 --> 1:44:15.400]  hand trust me trust me they put the bridle on it and they don't just want to
[1:44:15.400 --> 1:44:20.760]  ride this horse they want to take it over to a truck that's waiting there you
[1:44:20.760 --> 1:44:26.480]  go trust me horsey gonna lead you up off this ramp into the truck and then they
[1:44:26.480 --> 1:44:31.080]  slam the door and they say you're going to the Olmer's glue factory we're gonna
[1:44:31.080 --> 1:44:37.240]  render you down into into stakes to be shipped to France and we're gonna take
[1:44:37.240 --> 1:44:41.440]  your hooves and your cart lich and we're gonna make Elmer's glue out of it at a
[1:44:41.440 --> 1:44:50.680]  rendering plant oh shh it's okay it's all right and just see them building it
[1:44:50.680 --> 1:44:54.480]  all around us and admitting they're building it and they even talked to
[1:44:54.480 --> 1:44:58.400]  mid-level minions of the system who know enough of the picture to know it's
[1:44:58.400 --> 1:45:01.880]  sinister and they go but we've got to there's too many people and they kind of
[1:45:01.880 --> 1:45:06.800]  get this little demonic little smile and you go you know you say to them you
[1:45:06.800 --> 1:45:10.360]  feel like you're part of the power structure don't you you you feel like
[1:45:10.360 --> 1:45:17.080]  you're gonna end up winning they're like that's right I win and I'm like my god
[1:45:17.080 --> 1:45:28.400]  look at you look at what you've turned into look what you are and you pity them
[1:45:28.400 --> 1:45:34.000]  but it's just like that coral snake in the backyard but my children swings a
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  few years ago biggest coral snake I've ever seen it was red on yellow it was
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:48.560]  poisonous and I had that hoe I went in just to be sure I looked up online yeah
[1:45:48.560 --> 1:45:54.160]  I read on yellow kills a fellow it was curled up and it didn't mean any harm it
[1:45:54.160 --> 1:45:59.040]  was just a venomous snake and I killed it that in a hammer even though I thought
[1:45:59.040 --> 1:46:10.440]  it was beautiful and interesting I killed it but there's nothing beautiful and
[1:46:10.440 --> 1:46:15.000]  interesting about these people they are not engaging in a normal or natural way
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:20.520]  they are engaging in predatory activity against their own species when they
[1:46:20.520 --> 1:46:27.080]  themselves have they studied the pyramidal power structure are in the
[1:46:27.080 --> 1:46:32.360]  middle of the pyramid they are one of the most controlled dumb down assaulted
[1:46:32.360 --> 1:46:38.040]  groups out there the upper areas of the pyramid are most worried about the middle
[1:46:38.040 --> 1:46:42.560]  area of the pyramidal power structure the control system and they're always
[1:46:42.560 --> 1:46:49.560]  seeking to have dirt on you to dumb you down to control you and then in different
[1:46:49.560 --> 1:46:57.320]  phases engage in purges and so you're not helping yourself it's a pipe dream it's
[1:46:57.320 --> 1:47:05.640]  a spell it's an illusion that you're on the winning team you're not
[1:47:09.240 --> 1:47:13.520]  all right let's go to the calls here let's talk to Rod and Indiana go ahead
[1:47:13.520 --> 1:47:20.240]  Rod hey how you doing Alex good I'm glad to see you back and you need to take
[1:47:20.240 --> 1:47:27.560]  care of yourself because you help us I just like to make a few comments I live
[1:47:27.560 --> 1:47:32.960]  in Indiana here they're trying to take my home without any due process of the
[1:47:32.960 --> 1:47:38.680]  law they already have I can't afford to move anywhere I don't have that kind of
[1:47:38.680 --> 1:47:43.400]  money or luxury well now when you're homeless the feds are paying the cities to
[1:47:43.400 --> 1:47:48.520]  forcibly thumb print and face scan you and then many states are now forcing
[1:47:48.520 --> 1:47:51.240]  people to live in camps they you know they they don't let you live on the
[1:47:51.240 --> 1:47:56.280]  street and so it's a very hellish you know the New London Connecticut case said
[1:47:56.280 --> 1:47:59.760]  private interest can tell the government they want your land and the
[1:47:59.760 --> 1:48:03.120]  government will take it without just compensation you know that was what was
[1:48:03.120 --> 1:48:07.960]  buried in the news articles with that case four years ago is that they take it
[1:48:07.960 --> 1:48:16.400]  without paying you and you know my dad owns some land and he got a notice called
[1:48:16.400 --> 1:48:20.160]  the taxpayers bill of rights in Texas and actually told him he had no rights
[1:48:20.160 --> 1:48:24.280]  they called it a taxpayer rights you have the rights to have no rights and it
[1:48:24.280 --> 1:48:29.040]  said when the government or a private corporation wants your land now you've
[1:48:29.040 --> 1:48:36.360]  got a few weeks to accept the price and that's it or you get nothing so it's
[1:48:36.360 --> 1:48:40.920]  either you sign the contract or your brains will be on the contract an offer
[1:48:40.920 --> 1:48:45.480]  you can't refuse but so so what how are they taking your house well they they
[1:48:45.480 --> 1:48:49.880]  I bought the home I paid cash and I told them they had to fix a few things
[1:48:49.880 --> 1:48:55.160]  they didn't want to fix them so they sold the contract to an uncle and he
[1:48:55.160 --> 1:49:01.600]  foreclosed without any due process here I've called attorneys attorneys say what
[1:49:01.600 --> 1:49:06.920]  black hole do you live in because they haven't heard of anything since 1939 in
[1:49:06.920 --> 1:49:12.000]  Alabama like this every attorney goes on everywhere listen that's the thing I
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:16.320]  found is in business period everything's getting corrupt and then as other
[1:49:16.320 --> 1:49:21.280]  people get cheated and screwed they don't think it's okay to do it to you but
[1:49:21.280 --> 1:49:27.520]  you look you you did a deal with a shyster but you have the contract and
[1:49:27.520 --> 1:49:35.800]  so I would just call the sheriff I would go into court I would sue the
[1:49:35.800 --> 1:49:40.200]  individual or they sold it to a to somebody else they have a title
[1:49:40.200 --> 1:49:45.160]  company what's going on yeah the title company didn't do they took my name off
[1:49:45.160 --> 1:49:52.160]  everything without even a court hearing and they sold it to an uncle and he
[1:49:52.160 --> 1:49:56.920]  screwed so many people in this town but the attorneys say I have a case I just
[1:49:56.920 --> 1:50:04.400]  don't have no money oh it's a boss hog right and when they've done this so
[1:50:04.400 --> 1:50:09.000]  illegal and I've got an attorney saying he can't do anything because it's like a
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:14.640]  slow-moving car wreck and they're gonna have to physically force me out or kill
[1:50:14.640 --> 1:50:19.920]  me because I will not leave my home I will not well I would tell you before

[1:57:00.160 --> 1:57:05.760]  Randy Ryan and Robert go ahead you're on the air a Sean yeah hey Alex just
[1:57:05.760 --> 1:57:10.960]  make a comment on something that Glenn Beck was saying about a sliding scale in
[1:57:10.960 --> 1:57:16.320]  this country moving from what he calls anarchy with our founding fathers to
[1:57:16.320 --> 1:57:20.600]  big government control of what we're doing today and I just wanted to make
[1:57:20.600 --> 1:57:24.440]  comment that of course that's not really accurate right where we were a
[1:57:24.440 --> 1:57:29.360]  public where we are a republic and we simply need to move our country back to
[1:57:29.360 --> 1:57:34.360]  the republic and states rights it's not about anarchy and that the patriot
[1:57:34.360 --> 1:57:39.480]  movement of course is being demonized by the dhs lexicon report and whatnot but
[1:57:39.480 --> 1:57:44.200]  we're really not anarchists were you know not even founding father
[1:57:44.200 --> 1:57:48.160]  revolutionaries what was funny I'm gonna hold you over stay there I'm gonna hold

[1:58:16.560 --> 1:58:20.840]  right paradigm he said false left right paradigm and then he said there is a
[1:58:20.840 --> 1:58:32.680]  true scale from liberty on one end and tyranny on the other and I know who
[1:58:32.680 --> 1:58:38.720]  invented that modern scale to explain things it was red Beckman show literally

[1:59:52.640 --> 2:00:06.280]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[2:00:06.280 --> 2:00:13.520]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[2:00:13.520 --> 2:00:22.400]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[2:00:22.400 --> 2:00:46.000]  all right we are back live you know I don't like attacking other talk show
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:52.840]  host but when rush Limbaugh still says this day he supports the mandatory
[2:00:52.840 --> 2:00:58.360]  sentencing laws for cocaine and heroin that can put a first time offender in
[2:00:58.360 --> 2:01:04.800]  jail for five to ten years but then he's using a prescription drug whose
[2:01:04.800 --> 2:01:13.120]  molecule is more addictive than heroin and mimics it and that's okay he doesn't
[2:01:13.120 --> 2:01:18.640]  get in trouble doctor shopping everything else it's look I don't like
[2:01:18.640 --> 2:01:22.060]  sounding like all the other petty people that just attack each other but
[2:01:22.060 --> 2:01:25.240]  Limbaugh is a huge icon it has to be done from time to time but I feel sorry
[2:01:25.240 --> 2:01:29.360]  for Limbaugh and I've heard him on the air 20 years ago he was a different
[2:01:29.360 --> 2:01:33.720]  person he was a lot better per second amendment you could tell he was for real
[2:01:33.720 --> 2:01:39.400]  and I've seen him just five years he was okay and then he really turned into pro
[2:01:39.400 --> 2:01:45.200]  new world order soon as he got really big he sold out and I don't like talking
[2:01:45.200 --> 2:01:48.720]  about Glenn Beck but when he gets up there and says I'm a patriot leader you
[2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:53.440]  can trust me I'm going to tell you the truth I think the camps are real and
[2:01:53.440 --> 2:01:56.520]  builds it up for a month I said folks he's gonna come out and say they aren't
[2:01:56.520 --> 2:02:03.280]  real and I called what he would specifically do because all I do is
[2:02:03.280 --> 2:02:07.680]  study this I know who Glenn Beck is I've watched him from afar I've listened to
[2:02:07.680 --> 2:02:16.200]  him off and on and he's really bad news folks very bad news and he is a sigh up
[2:02:16.200 --> 2:02:20.200]  from the beginning there's no doubt and you know if I just wanted to be
[2:02:20.200 --> 2:02:23.720]  successful here on radio I wouldn't attack him because when you attack big
[2:02:23.720 --> 2:02:28.840]  people it tends to alienate those that listen to that person so if I was just
[2:02:28.840 --> 2:02:33.320]  here to get a big audience I would not do that but I'm not here just to have a
[2:02:33.320 --> 2:02:38.840]  big audience or to make money I'm here to tell the truth and tell it like it is
[2:02:38.840 --> 2:02:42.960]  and yeah it's it's very interesting I actually wrote a note as I was driving
[2:02:42.960 --> 2:02:45.680]  on the highway that's out my little notebook out there are things I wanted
[2:02:45.680 --> 2:02:51.720]  to cover later in the week I was listening to red Beckman the earliest
[2:02:51.720 --> 2:02:56.440]  person I know of was red Beckman who explained the sliding scale of liberty
[2:02:56.440 --> 2:03:02.160]  versus tyranny now others have taken that scale and said anarchy on one end
[2:03:02.160 --> 2:03:05.400]  with a republic in the middle and the tyranny on one end you got the tyranny
[2:03:05.400 --> 2:03:08.440]  on the left or right no matter which one you sticking on left right doesn't
[2:03:08.440 --> 2:03:19.600]  count you got tyranny on one end and you've got anarchy on the other and in
[2:03:19.600 --> 2:03:25.200]  the middle you have a republic and there's other scales where you can say
[2:03:25.200 --> 2:03:31.800]  in a left-right paradigm there is fascist tyranny on the right and there
[2:03:31.800 --> 2:03:35.680]  is socialist tyranny on the left and each one is black uniforms death camps
[2:03:35.680 --> 2:03:41.680]  secret police total you know control and then in the middle of that spectrum is
[2:03:41.680 --> 2:03:45.200]  liberty the furthest away from each of those systems you can get to but the
[2:03:45.200 --> 2:03:53.240]  point is then the second place I ever saw it was Geo Griffin a film he made in
[2:03:53.240 --> 2:04:00.720]  the 60s about the political paradigms and it glimbex definitely seen it and

[2:04:25.560 --> 2:04:28.840]  thing that we have to remember here as we're you know getting ready for our
[2:04:28.840 --> 2:04:32.400]  tea party movement so whatever else we're doing to get ready is the

[2:08:33.920 --> 2:08:39.320]  always try to explain that to the controlled left that you take somebody's
[2:08:39.320 --> 2:08:42.640]  second amendment you're gonna lose your first amendment and always try to
[2:08:42.640 --> 2:08:46.320]  explain that to the controlled right you take somebody's first amendment they're
[2:08:46.320 --> 2:08:50.600]  gonna take your second and they're gonna take your property rights under the
[2:08:50.600 --> 2:08:54.480]  10th of the 9th they're gonna violate those and that's now happening house bill

[2:09:03.880 --> 2:09:08.040]  an accurate article by Kurt Nemo hard to believe but it's really happening also
[2:09:08.040 --> 2:09:11.760]  saying hurting somebody's feelings to be a felony I got a bunch of other
[2:09:11.760 --> 2:09:20.000]  economic news and some torture news as well that we're gonna be going over
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:26.280]  here but right now I wanted to go to Paul Watson in fact it's one of the top
[2:09:26.280 --> 2:09:34.480]  stories up on presentplanet.com maybe we'll punch that up for folks and it
[2:09:34.480 --> 2:09:43.280]  deals with the founding of the European Union by Nazis now this is no secret we
[2:09:43.280 --> 2:09:49.040]  actually cover this in in-game blueprint for global enslavement but the founding
[2:09:49.040 --> 2:09:52.840]  members of Bilderberg are also the founding members of the World Wildlife
[2:09:52.840 --> 2:09:59.680]  Fund to teach the public as the club of Rome admitted in the 1960s and then
[2:09:59.680 --> 2:10:04.240]  again in republished documents in the early 90s one written by Richard N.
[2:10:04.240 --> 2:10:09.920]  Haas that humans are the enemy and that the world government must be convened
[2:10:09.920 --> 2:10:13.680]  and set up to carry out the controlled extermination of the majority of the
[2:10:13.680 --> 2:10:18.120]  population now I'm not the one saying this they're the one saying it and the
[2:10:18.120 --> 2:10:23.520]  Nazis killed tens of millions of people that war killed 20 million Germans
[2:10:23.520 --> 2:10:30.600]  at least 20 million Russians a million Americans and Brits and if you remember
[2:10:30.600 --> 2:10:34.920]  the king of England Edward the 8th had to advocate the throne because it came
[2:10:34.920 --> 2:10:38.720]  out he was a Nazi follows them with Hitler supporting Hitler when the war
[2:10:38.720 --> 2:10:42.840]  started he had to run out of Spain you know and then when basically was told
[2:10:42.840 --> 2:10:46.760]  to get out of town and go to the British Virgin Islands and he basically left
[2:10:46.760 --> 2:10:52.240]  for the war at his grace it was no longer the king because he was a big
[2:10:52.240 --> 2:10:57.720]  Nazi and and this was all a setup Hitler was told you're gonna attack the
[2:10:57.720 --> 2:11:01.040]  communists you're gonna take over France they had a deal with the Vici
[2:11:01.040 --> 2:11:05.200]  French this is on record for the Brit where the British military would
[2:11:05.200 --> 2:11:09.400]  evacuate out to Dunkirk Hitler would just act like he was attacking him this
[2:11:09.400 --> 2:11:14.080]  is now been declassified and drop have Herman Guring have the Wolf Waffa bomb
[2:11:14.080 --> 2:11:19.000]  out to see far away from the ships and in the film reels got released and they
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:22.720]  said Hitler is not attacking and the documents have come out and it's even on
[2:11:22.720 --> 2:11:26.600]  pbs that Hitler quote didn't want to attack the British well they had a deal
[2:11:26.600 --> 2:11:30.400]  then suddenly the British announced we are going to attack you I mean talk about
[2:11:30.400 --> 2:11:33.600]  conspiracy theories it's not a conspiracy theory it's a conspiracy fact
[2:11:33.600 --> 2:11:41.800]  that the marginal line and all of that didn't didn't fail in World War two and
[2:11:41.800 --> 2:11:47.960]  Hitler's Blitzkrieg you know was not the great success I mean the Polish held
[2:11:47.960 --> 2:11:52.640]  out just defending one city for many days and they had horse-drawn carriages
[2:11:52.640 --> 2:11:58.600]  and people fighting tanks with swords the the French had a modern military the
[2:11:58.600 --> 2:12:03.840]  the the the Vici French dominated the entire military and most of the French
[2:12:03.840 --> 2:12:09.200]  government and they wanted a coup of France that's why Hitler took over in a
[2:12:09.200 --> 2:12:15.080]  week came into the tour of Paris and then left and then they moved the capital
[2:12:15.080 --> 2:12:21.760]  down to to the city of Vici that hence it gets the name the Vici French
[2:12:21.760 --> 2:12:26.560]  government they were the collaborators it was all staged it was meant to be a
[2:12:26.560 --> 2:12:32.360]  European Union takeover by Hitler and he would take over Europe and then he
[2:12:32.360 --> 2:12:41.600]  would unify Europe as the new Germania to attack the Russians and the Bolsheviks
[2:12:41.600 --> 2:12:45.080]  and then exterminate most of them they were going to do blood test and and
[2:12:45.080 --> 2:12:50.000]  other genotypes and they had other quack systems of measuring the skull and
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:54.040]  nose and things of all the Slavs and those that were airing enough would live
[2:12:54.040 --> 2:13:00.240]  the rest would be killed Hitler wouldn't bomb once he got betrayed quote by the
[2:13:00.240 --> 2:13:05.720]  British he wouldn't bomb London and he gave speeches saying this is the most
[2:13:05.720 --> 2:13:09.640]  pure Arians there are because they weren't overrun as much as Germany was
[2:13:09.640 --> 2:13:16.800]  you know by the by the Mongols and some of those invasions that went on even
[2:13:16.800 --> 2:13:23.120]  into Western Europe and so I don't want to bomb and kill any of our precious
[2:13:23.120 --> 2:13:28.760]  Arians and so England flew it right into Berlin and bombed it just to get Hitler
[2:13:28.760 --> 2:13:33.240]  to attack and and then he did but the whole thing is it was a but trail in
[2:13:33.240 --> 2:13:38.880]  quotes this is all on record in mainline history books they just don't make a big
[2:13:38.880 --> 2:13:42.560]  bill out of it on TV but you get a piece of it here a piece of it there and
[2:13:42.560 --> 2:13:48.520]  that's why the deputy furor Rudolph Hess flew in you know he'd been a war one
[2:13:48.520 --> 2:13:52.800]  fighter race he flew it in his own plane parachuted in with all these magical
[2:13:52.800 --> 2:13:56.600]  ambulance saying I have the peace treaty I have the secret deal you weren't
[2:13:56.600 --> 2:14:00.080]  supposed to attack if you're supposed to let us take Europe and then you know the
[2:14:00.080 --> 2:14:03.040]  king of England was going to rule it all with you know with Hitler being the
[2:14:03.040 --> 2:14:06.920]  political leader and Edward the eight being the you know the sovereign leader
[2:14:06.920 --> 2:14:13.000]  and they were going to have the Vatican is the new religious you know center
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:17.440]  reborn and that was what was in the documents and we cover that to some
[2:14:17.440 --> 2:14:22.480]  extent an end game and then Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands a German
[2:14:22.480 --> 2:14:28.000]  prince Saxe-Coburg go through related to the queen and Edward the 8th closely he
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:31.540]  was a Nazi so then when they decided to switch and have the house of orange
[2:14:31.540 --> 2:14:36.080]  fight against the Nazis they had him at a photo op with a machine gun shooting at
[2:14:36.080 --> 2:14:42.040]  Luftwaffe planes as they came in he then ran across the channel join the RAF
[2:14:42.040 --> 2:14:47.560]  was good buddies with Prince Philip the eugenicist as well who says you know
[2:14:47.560 --> 2:14:53.960]  blacks aren't humans and get rid of them and then you have the eugenics set up
[2:14:53.960 --> 2:14:57.880]  in England in the United States that Hitler quotes in Mein Kampf and quotes
[2:14:57.880 --> 2:15:02.720]  in all these speeches and giving awards to Thomas Watson of IBM and Margaret
[2:15:02.720 --> 2:15:07.040]  Sanger and the Colgate's and others and them giving him awards and you know
[2:15:07.040 --> 2:15:10.960]  different industrialists in the US giving Hitler you know gifts of two
[2:15:10.960 --> 2:15:16.440]  million dollars and gold bars and just oh my Hitler on the cover of Time Magazine

[2:25:22.280 --> 2:25:29.840]  evaporates like phantoms at dawn try to remember the Thomas Jefferson quote

[2:25:34.280 --> 2:25:39.520]  vanish like phantoms at dawn let's go ahead and go to Paul Watson all right
[2:25:39.520 --> 2:25:43.480]  Paul I'll shut up here go over the article that you've written that's a
[2:25:43.480 --> 2:25:47.000]  get the it's all over mainstream news what we've already reported for years
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:51.280]  but here it is mainstream news top Nazis plan to EU style forthright then they
[2:25:51.280 --> 2:25:55.280]  founded Bilderberg and now they admit they set up the European Union and the
[2:25:55.280 --> 2:26:05.800]  NAU all of it okay well what we already knew before these latest documents came out was this as everybody
[2:26:05.800 --> 2:26:10.880]  know was the first couple of years of the Second World War the Nazis blitz
[2:26:10.880 --> 2:26:17.200]  through Europe they were on top but from the early 1940s onwards the worm had
[2:26:17.200 --> 2:26:23.840]  turned and they knew that military defeat was all but certain and so they
[2:26:23.840 --> 2:26:29.560]  started to devise ways of how they could preserve their power by means of
[2:26:29.560 --> 2:26:38.880]  consent over conquest and it was during this period the top Nazis such as Nazi
[2:26:38.880 --> 2:26:47.480]  economics minister Walter Funk wrote about the necessity to create quote a
[2:26:47.480 --> 2:26:53.640]  central European Union and quote a European economic area that's what
[2:26:53.640 --> 2:27:01.600]  Funk called for in his book the European community as well as him his co-authors
[2:27:01.600 --> 2:27:08.440]  Nazi academic Heinrich Hunker wrote in the same book quote classic national
[2:27:08.440 --> 2:27:14.040]  economy is dead community of fate which is the European economy fate and extent
[2:27:14.040 --> 2:27:21.560]  of European cooperation depends on a new unity economic plan also fellow Nazi
[2:27:21.560 --> 2:27:26.480]  Gustav Koenig wrote quote we have real European community task before us I am
[2:27:26.480 --> 2:27:30.560]  convinced that this community effort will last beyond the end of the war and
[2:27:30.560 --> 2:27:35.320]  that and that's why they always say that the European Union the engine of its
[2:27:35.320 --> 2:27:38.680]  Germany because the German taxpayers pay for it all it's because you've got
[2:27:38.680 --> 2:27:43.240]  crump industries and all of these guys who are right up there on par with the
[2:27:43.240 --> 2:27:47.920]  Rothschilds and others in the power structure they literally suck all the
[2:27:47.920 --> 2:27:51.760]  money on the German people to buy off the rest of Europe for themselves it's
[2:27:51.760 --> 2:27:59.360]  just a economic domination right and then in following the release of this book
[2:27:59.360 --> 2:28:06.000]  minister of propaganda Joseph Goebbels ordered the creation of quote large-scale
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:12.440]  economic unification of Europe believing that quote in 50 years time
[2:28:12.440 --> 2:28:20.960]  people would no longer think in terms of country this was in 1940 and in 1993 just
[2:28:20.960 --> 2:28:27.240]  53 years later the European Union in its current form was born
[2:28:27.240 --> 2:28:32.440]  Paul Paul that's why they're an irresistible force until you consciously
[2:28:32.440 --> 2:28:37.120]  realize what they're doing because they move like a glacier I mean they just it's
[2:28:37.120 --> 2:28:41.720]  just that irresistible force or I'm gonna twist you I'm gonna take my time
[2:28:41.720 --> 2:28:48.000]  butchering you real good and the general public's thinking on a day-to-day and the
[2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:53.960]  global masterminds they're thinking on 50 year models go ahead right it's a
[2:28:53.960 --> 2:29:00.200]  long-term agenda other top Nazis who also called the creation of pan-European
[2:29:00.200 --> 2:29:06.080]  federal economic superstate were ribbon-trop quisling and stifling quarts
[2:29:06.080 --> 2:29:12.240]  who he spoke for quote the new Europe of solidarity and cooperation among all
[2:29:12.240 --> 2:29:17.440]  its people will find rapidly increasing prosperity once once national
[2:29:17.440 --> 2:29:22.960]  economic boundaries are removed and that could have been taken straight out of a
[2:29:22.960 --> 2:29:27.760]  CFR meeting or a trilateral Commission meeting or whatever so you've got all
[2:29:27.760 --> 2:29:34.080]  these top Nazis in the early 40s saying we need a pan-European economic empire
[2:29:34.080 --> 2:29:38.360]  and we need to do it by consent rather than conquest and then we'll get on to
[2:29:38.360 --> 2:29:42.400]  the new documents which only solidify that this was taking place after the
[2:29:42.400 --> 2:29:46.400]  break yeah it's no doubt the entire European Union to be the center of the
[2:29:46.400 --> 2:29:49.920]  new world government as Gordon Brown has said is to carry out Nazi policies of

[2:34:07.240 --> 2:34:11.200]  build of a connection in a second yeah continue with the Nazi so so they're
[2:34:11.200 --> 2:34:16.440]  saying by 41 42 and you know this was always the rumor well no people had
[2:34:16.440 --> 2:34:21.040]  read history books that had the documents and they would tell people then
[2:34:21.040 --> 2:34:24.840]  folks would say I heard and then it became a rumor that all there was a
[2:34:24.840 --> 2:34:31.440]  secret Nazi plan to go underground the crypto you Genesis go ahead yeah so by
[2:34:31.440 --> 2:34:37.400]  41 42 they're saying it was necessary to roll that failing military agenda into a
[2:34:37.400 --> 2:34:45.840]  pan European economic agenda and the new revelations are that and an author who
[2:34:45.840 --> 2:34:52.040]  was writing a book called Adam Labour was collecting material for a fictional
[2:34:52.040 --> 2:34:57.760]  book based around the premise that Nazis who were seeking to preserve their
[2:34:57.760 --> 2:35:04.800]  power and their money at the end of the Second World War conspired to create a
[2:35:04.800 --> 2:35:10.680]  fourth Reich using the infiltration of creating a European Union which we've
[2:35:10.680 --> 2:35:15.800]  just talked about and in the researching and collecting material for this book
[2:35:15.800 --> 2:35:21.600]  because obviously all such books are based loosely on historical fact he
[2:35:21.600 --> 2:35:27.040]  actually discovered documents which directly proved the plot to be true and
[2:35:27.040 --> 2:35:34.640]  this document is called US military intelligence report EWPA 128 and it's
[2:35:34.640 --> 2:35:40.680]  also known as the Red House report and in that document it talks about how top
[2:35:40.680 --> 2:35:48.400]  Nazis met in Strasbourg France in 1944 knowing that they were about to lose the
[2:35:48.400 --> 2:35:55.440]  war obviously and they conspired to create a fourth Reich based on a pan
[2:35:55.440 --> 2:36:01.840]  European economic empire and the European common market and what the plan
[2:36:01.840 --> 2:36:11.200]  consisted of was top Nazi SS officers like Dr. Scheed ordered wealthy Nazi
[2:36:11.200 --> 2:36:16.960]  industrialists and bankers to set up front companies abroad and poses
[2:36:16.960 --> 2:36:22.720]  reformed Democrats so that they could achieve economic penetration throughout
[2:36:22.720 --> 2:36:27.240]  Europe and ultimately lay the foundations for the reemergence of the
[2:36:27.240 --> 2:36:33.720]  Nazis now this consisted primarily of people like Alfred Krupp of Krupp
[2:36:33.720 --> 2:36:40.080]  Industries and Friedrich Flick according to these documents as well as front
[2:36:40.080 --> 2:36:46.280]  companies that we are still in operation elevators coffee machines car
[2:36:46.280 --> 2:36:50.560]  manufacturers when you really know who the Nazis are it's like everything you're
[2:36:50.560 --> 2:36:56.440]  looking at a store store shelves that you know that isn't Chinese right BMW
[2:36:56.440 --> 2:37:02.440]  Stevens Volkswagen as many others and they were tasked with infiltrating the
[2:37:02.440 --> 2:37:08.800]  European business market and creating this foundation for the Nazi ideology
[2:37:08.800 --> 2:37:14.240]  to persist even after they were defeated militarily and that we've got a quote in
[2:37:14.240 --> 2:37:21.080]  the article from historian Michael Pinto Duchinsky who said quote for many
[2:37:21.080 --> 2:37:26.000]  leading industrial figures close to the Nazi regime Europe became a cover for
[2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:31.040]  pursuing German national interest after the defeat of Hitler the continuity of
[2:37:31.040 --> 2:37:36.200]  the economy of Germany and the economies of post-war Europe is striking some of
[2:37:36.200 --> 2:37:40.800]  the leading figures in the Nazi economy became leading builders of the European
[2:37:40.800 --> 2:37:48.280]  Union and quote now the key man in all this is somebody called Herman Abbs
[2:37:48.280 --> 2:37:55.720]  their name a BS now he was known as Hitler's top banker and in fact David
[2:37:55.720 --> 2:38:01.800]  Rockefeller let me get the direct quote called abs the greatest banker of the
[2:38:01.800 --> 2:38:08.960]  20th century now abs was on the board of Deutsche Bank when the Nazis rose to
[2:38:08.960 --> 2:38:14.920]  prominence in the 1930s and he also held no less than 40 director ships in
[2:38:14.920 --> 2:38:19.560]  Nazi companies during that same period he was also on the board of IG
[2:38:19.560 --> 2:38:25.320]  Farben who of course made the cyclone be gas hot held the patent to it which was
[2:38:25.320 --> 2:38:30.880]  used to kill the concentration camp victims he was also put in charge of
[2:38:30.880 --> 2:38:38.040]  allocating martial aid reconstruction funds so he basically managed Germany's
[2:38:38.040 --> 2:38:42.960]  economic recovery after the war now where it gets even more interesting is the
[2:38:42.960 --> 2:38:49.560]  fact that abs was a founding member of the European League for economic
[2:38:49.560 --> 2:38:57.200]  cooperation which was set up in 1946 now just by coincidence the other people
[2:38:57.200 --> 2:39:01.760]  who helped him set this up and this European League for economic
[2:39:01.760 --> 2:39:07.080]  cooperation still exists today it was one of the primary drivers behind the
[2:39:07.080 --> 2:39:12.680]  eventual creation of the European economic market in 57 it still exists
[2:39:12.680 --> 2:39:16.760]  today and it has the advisory status that the Council of Europe and on the
[2:39:16.760 --> 2:39:21.920]  United Nations Economic Commission for Europe so this is a key organization in
[2:39:21.920 --> 2:39:26.960]  setting the foundation for the creation of the European Union it was set up by
[2:39:26.960 --> 2:39:33.880]  abs the top Nazi it was top banker and I might add a Bilderberg member when the
[2:39:33.880 --> 2:39:41.880]  Bilderberg organization came into existence in just before 54 also people
[2:39:41.880 --> 2:39:46.200]  who helped abs set up this European League for economic cooperation were
[2:39:46.200 --> 2:39:54.320]  among others Edmund discard this dang top Bilderberg member Paul Van
[2:39:54.320 --> 2:40:01.040]  Zeeland top Bilderberg member and Joseph Rettinger also top Bilderberg
[2:40:01.040 --> 2:40:06.080]  member so you've got obviously Bilderberg came into existence in the
[2:40:06.080 --> 2:40:13.280]  early 50s so you've got people industrialists including top Nazis
[2:40:13.280 --> 2:40:18.920]  forming this European League for economic cooperation in 1946 and then
[2:40:18.920 --> 2:40:24.480]  you have Bilderberg bragging in public documents the BBC and others to the EU
[2:40:24.480 --> 2:40:29.840]  observer a few weeks ago vice-counter Etienne Davignon we personally
[2:40:29.840 --> 2:40:37.080]  videotaped last year in DC and then again before that in Canada in Ottawa at
[2:40:37.080 --> 2:40:42.280]  the Brook Street they bragged that they covertly set this up and they're proud
[2:40:42.280 --> 2:40:48.120]  of themselves and you've got Prince Bernard the SS member who is the founder
[2:40:48.120 --> 2:40:53.720]  with the others you just mentioned setting all of this up I mean there is
[2:40:53.720 --> 2:40:57.920]  it's totally there and then all they pushes eugenics and bankrupting the
[2:40:57.920 --> 2:41:01.480]  middle class and then people say well they're Nazis and they want whites to
[2:41:01.480 --> 2:41:06.600]  breed no then they fund these programs to have the West not have children as
[2:41:06.600 --> 2:41:09.840]  the West dies and they have all these Bilderberg group members and club of
[2:41:09.840 --> 2:41:14.280]  Rome people come out and say that they want to cut the population of
[2:41:14.280 --> 2:41:18.560]  Australia England in half Canada in half US in half and when you read their
[2:41:18.560 --> 2:41:21.960]  eugenics documents for all the white supremacists out there thinking who
[2:41:21.960 --> 2:41:26.840]  we know we like the new order then no you don't yeah you because what you
[2:41:26.840 --> 2:41:30.280]  understand is they say that they tell the public about positive and negative
[2:41:30.280 --> 2:41:34.160]  eugenicists who they see as the master race needs to interbreed and make
[2:41:34.160 --> 2:41:40.040]  smarter faster better longer lived more stable people and then negative eugenics
[2:41:40.040 --> 2:41:45.280]  sterilize or kill or get rid of or starve the you know the subhumans in their
[2:41:45.280 --> 2:41:49.640]  twisted view but what but they say that's for the public what we want is to
[2:41:49.640 --> 2:41:55.480]  actually get rid of our competition that are the whites and Jews and a few
[2:41:55.480 --> 2:42:00.040]  other griffs including quote some of the higher orientals as they call them that
[2:42:00.040 --> 2:42:04.320]  they want world government to knock out their competition now now again I'm not
[2:42:04.320 --> 2:42:08.280]  even saying I believe in all this I'm stating what they believe how evil is
[2:42:08.280 --> 2:42:13.440]  that to want to kill their own race because they believe it's a master race
[2:42:13.440 --> 2:42:19.120]  that threatens them I mean these are some sick sick puppies man these are these
[2:42:19.120 --> 2:42:28.240]  are some sick sick sick sick sick people Paul right I'm knowing the origins of
[2:42:28.240 --> 2:42:34.120]  their ideology it's no surprise because as you mentioned okay we've got that we
[2:42:34.120 --> 2:42:39.600]  got top Nazis and future Bilderberg is creating the this European economic
[2:42:39.600 --> 2:42:46.840]  group in 1946 by the early 50s when they start to meet and plan all this through
[2:42:46.840 --> 2:42:51.920]  the Bilderberg group they start talking about quote pressing need to bring the
[2:42:51.920 --> 2:42:56.280]  German people together with the other peoples of Europe into a common market
[2:42:56.280 --> 2:43:03.760]  and these documents came out of the 1955 Bilderberg meeting documents which have
[2:43:03.760 --> 2:43:08.080]  now been released by the WikiLeaks website which we reported on last week
[2:43:08.080 --> 2:43:14.280]  so in 55 they're talking about creating a European common market but not by the
[2:43:14.280 --> 2:43:19.000]  creation of a new authority they said it's got to be done by a via a treaty
[2:43:19.000 --> 2:43:22.840]  otherwise we're not going to get it done so low and behold two years later
[2:43:22.840 --> 2:43:29.120]  in 1957 the first incarnation of the European Union the European economic
[2:43:29.120 --> 2:43:38.080]  community is passed via the Rome treaty also in the 55 Bilderberg documents it
[2:43:38.080 --> 2:43:43.160]  talks about quote it might be better to proceed through the development of
[2:43:43.160 --> 2:43:47.400]  common market by treaty I've talked about that it also talks about the need
[2:43:47.400 --> 2:43:56.360]  to create a single European currency and this is in 1955 the single European
[2:43:56.360 --> 2:44:02.640]  currency was only proposed in 1992 that's when it was first proposed by the way
[2:44:02.640 --> 2:44:06.200]  I'll make this point I make routinely Paul this is so important we'll go back
[2:44:06.200 --> 2:44:11.920]  we were just saying remember in 2007 in all the capital cities of Europe they
[2:44:11.920 --> 2:44:17.760]  had giant parades for 50 years of the euro and people nobody showed up and it
[2:44:17.760 --> 2:44:21.320]  was empty streets and they said for all the fireworks displays and parades they
[2:44:21.320 --> 2:44:26.640]  said but we thought this thing just started in 2000 how is it 50 years of
[2:44:26.640 --> 2:44:32.040]  the euro and that's because of the Treaty of Rome in 1957 you had the European
[2:44:32.040 --> 2:44:38.760]  Union just like with the treaty they had in Waco in 2005 in March and they said
[2:44:38.760 --> 2:44:42.440]  the treaty was secret but people sued and got it we are now in the year in the
[2:44:42.440 --> 2:44:46.040]  North American Union and down the road bill announced you know 20 years in
[2:44:46.040 --> 2:44:49.080]  North American Union people go but I thought this started last year and
[2:44:49.080 --> 2:44:55.120]  they'll be it didn't slave so please continue Paul yeah they actually had
[2:44:55.120 --> 2:45:00.960]  another EU ceremony in Paris last year when I was in Paris and they had they
[2:45:00.960 --> 2:45:07.000]  had EU flags on top of the Eiffel Tower and the Ark between nobody seemed very
[2:45:07.000 --> 2:45:11.360]  interested in it but it was just a statement you know we own this this is
[2:45:11.360 --> 2:45:15.440]  ours and that's what they do with EU flags everywhere now but going back to
[2:45:15.440 --> 2:45:22.920]  what I was talking about yeah they proposed the euro in 1955 and that's
[2:45:22.920 --> 2:45:30.920]  42 sorry it's yeah it's around about 40 years before it was actually first
[2:45:30.920 --> 2:45:36.960]  proposed and introduced and so you've got a straight line between the Nazi
[2:45:36.960 --> 2:45:45.280]  the creation of these groups which laid the foundations for the EU then the
[2:45:45.280 --> 2:45:49.400]  Bilderberg group which is when they formalized the policies to create the
[2:45:49.400 --> 2:45:56.760]  EU and the euro and then the creation of the EEC in 1957 and then obviously in
[2:45:56.760 --> 2:46:02.640]  the decade since the EEC got bigger and bigger and eventually became the European
[2:46:02.640 --> 2:46:11.120]  Union in 1993 and in the 21st century now we have the European Union basically
[2:46:11.120 --> 2:46:17.240]  laying everything out on the table and not even hiding behind this
[2:46:17.240 --> 2:46:22.920]  rationalization that it's just a trading partnership and they've proposed now with
[2:46:22.920 --> 2:46:28.120]  the Lisbon Treaty basically to take away any remaining sovereignty whatsoever
[2:46:28.120 --> 2:46:35.400]  held by nation-states and create a truly federal European super state and the
[2:46:35.400 --> 2:46:44.360]  origins of it as have now improved vehemently can be found with Nazis
[2:46:44.360 --> 2:46:50.240]  and Nazi ideology and other Bilderberg group documents have leaked and we can
[2:46:50.240 --> 2:46:54.520]  publicly see the policies of the European Union they claim if you're not for open
[2:46:54.520 --> 2:46:58.800]  borders you're a racist so they always use the attack of what they
[2:46:58.800 --> 2:47:04.160]  themselves really are and so that's what's so cold-blooded about this take
[2:47:04.160 --> 2:47:09.040]  the Royal Commission on Population 1949 it states if we industrialize the third
[2:47:09.040 --> 2:47:13.240]  world they'll stop having as many children but that won't give us as much
[2:47:13.240 --> 2:47:18.200]  power so we'll keep policies in the third world with the IMF and World Bank to
[2:47:18.200 --> 2:47:23.600]  bankrupt them they'll have more children it'll actually chew up the rain forest
[2:47:23.600 --> 2:47:29.440]  and and and the the indigenous animals but that's okay because later we'll come
[2:47:29.440 --> 2:47:33.640]  in with other sterilization programs and just call off the mass so we'll use a
[2:47:33.640 --> 2:47:37.880]  population bomb as a weapon and then we'll come in and use a eugenics
[2:47:37.880 --> 2:47:42.920]  operation against those people I mean this is a scorched earth policy of we'll
[2:47:42.920 --> 2:47:47.120]  screw everything up we'll destroy half the planet if we need to to get this
[2:47:47.120 --> 2:47:52.240]  system in control will GMO all the crops if that's what it takes to take over the
[2:47:52.240 --> 2:47:57.640]  third world populations destroy their crops I mean it again it's just such a
[2:47:57.640 --> 2:48:03.800]  diabolical design that they run and then we see the Club of Rome and the CFR
[2:48:03.800 --> 2:48:08.920]  and these European Union groups openly it's always about eugenics and getting
[2:48:08.920 --> 2:48:13.120]  rid of the middle class and bankrupting the population and and doing all these
[2:48:13.120 --> 2:48:20.120]  horrible things it is just so cold-blooded Paul Watson to then understand
[2:48:20.120 --> 2:48:24.680]  that this isn't even Nazi to say Nazi you know makes a nice headline in the
[2:48:24.680 --> 2:48:30.440]  British newspapers but exactly but more than that it's a scientific
[2:48:30.440 --> 2:48:36.160]  dictatorship of eugenics and the Nazis were only one manifestation of what the
[2:48:36.160 --> 2:48:40.880]  Milner group developed to tear up Europe so then again the Anglo-American
[2:48:40.880 --> 2:48:44.360]  establishment could come in as the savior so the Anglo-American establishment
[2:48:44.360 --> 2:48:48.760]  can't come into the Middle East unless they fund radical Muslims to tear up
[2:48:48.760 --> 2:48:53.000]  stuff so they have an excuse they can't come into Europe and take over France and
[2:48:53.000 --> 2:48:56.360]  the Netherlands and all these other countries unless they can come in and
[2:48:56.360 --> 2:49:02.440]  and put a Hitler in to do it you know it again they they are just masters at
[2:49:02.440 --> 2:49:08.720]  engineering these systems and then using the Nazis on the continent and all those
[2:49:08.720 --> 2:49:13.240]  funds and treasure they amassed telling the rich doctors and scientists and the
[2:49:13.240 --> 2:49:18.760]  crumps and the elites join with us now here's the real eugenics plan go
[2:49:18.760 --> 2:49:22.600]  underground into a corporate state which is what Lord Milner wanted in the
[2:49:22.600 --> 2:49:28.080]  teams 30 years before and we'll let you in on the real system and then they did
[2:49:28.080 --> 2:49:32.600]  and now Germany's the main engine of the European Union I mean these these guys
[2:49:32.600 --> 2:49:39.520]  are sophisticated Paul indeed they are what we need to remember is that you know
[2:49:39.520 --> 2:49:45.560]  most individuals most MVP's in the European Union Union Parliament are not
[2:49:45.560 --> 2:49:52.400]  Nazis but the origins of their organization is and the very nature of
[2:49:52.400 --> 2:49:58.240]  the European Union in that it seeks to remove power from national governments
[2:49:58.240 --> 2:50:02.960]  who are accountable to their citizens to their electorate and centralize it into
[2:50:02.960 --> 2:50:09.480]  the hands of an elite that are electable to nobody but themselves is by its
[2:50:09.480 --> 2:50:14.920]  very own nature totalitarian well even if even if you don't believe that it had
[2:50:14.920 --> 2:50:20.520]  not the origins which are now proven it is totalitarian by its very nature well
[2:50:20.520 --> 2:50:26.280]  exactly all but let me go ahead Paul you've got the Lisbon Treaty coming up
[2:50:26.280 --> 2:50:32.480]  again in autumn now they can't ratify it without every member state giving the
[2:50:32.480 --> 2:50:35.800]  go ahead and the only one that's opposed to the island because that's the only
[2:50:35.800 --> 2:50:40.400]  one apart from a few others that allowed it to go to referendum and because they
[2:50:40.400 --> 2:50:44.040]  island voted no they're just gonna make them vote on it again they won't say
[2:50:44.040 --> 2:50:47.000]  they're pronounced that stay there we'll do a final segment with you and then I
[2:50:47.000 --> 2:50:49.680]  promise get through the calls that have been holding them to cover the attacks on
[2:50:49.680 --> 2:50:52.520]  free speech and news blitz for the rest of the show the whole of their hour
[2:50:52.520 --> 2:50:57.560]  coming up key saving the most important stuff for last coming up but I've got
[2:50:57.560 --> 2:51:00.240]  some comments on what Paul's covering as well that are very important when we get
[2:51:00.240 --> 2:51:04.120]  back stay with us millions of Americans are beginning to realize the
[2:51:04.120 --> 2:51:08.120]  enormity of the economic and political problems facing the US and the world and

[2:53:53.000 --> 2:54:02.040]  hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608 that's 908-691-2608
[2:54:02.040 --> 2:54:18.360]  if you study Adolf Hitler you'll learn that he believed that everybody should
[2:54:18.360 --> 2:54:22.280]  become vegetarians by law I'm not attacking vegetarians for some
[2:54:22.280 --> 2:54:30.400]  distating facts here that there should be laws against hunting he was against
[2:54:30.400 --> 2:54:37.120]  hunting he was basically more akin to a PETA supporter than anything else and he
[2:54:37.120 --> 2:54:41.920]  believed in culling humans and he believed in keeping small groups of
[2:54:41.920 --> 2:54:49.360]  blacks alive in certain areas of Africa kind of as a zoo you know would keep a
[2:54:49.360 --> 2:54:54.160]  live elephants or something as a laboratory example he believed that
[2:54:54.160 --> 2:55:01.440]  they would let the Japanese dominate and cull the Asian populations they were
[2:55:01.440 --> 2:55:08.320]  going to take over all of Russia and Central Asia and exterminate everyone
[2:55:08.320 --> 2:55:16.480]  who didn't pass muster same thing with most the Latin American nations and this
[2:55:16.480 --> 2:55:21.040]  is what they believed in now when you see things like carbon taxes proposed in
[2:55:21.040 --> 2:55:24.680]  the 60s this comes right out of Club of Rome right out of Bilderberg group Prince
[2:55:24.680 --> 2:55:31.160]  Phillip and Prince Bernhard both Nazis on record in fact Prince Philip we
[2:55:31.160 --> 2:55:37.160]  forget about the consort the Duke of Edinburgh to the Queen of England he
[2:55:37.160 --> 2:55:43.760]  was a Nazi his sisters all married Nazis they're all Nazis they're all Nazis
[2:55:43.760 --> 2:55:48.360]  and you could say what you want about who runs the world and and what the
[2:55:48.360 --> 2:55:53.520]  system is the facts are the facts and they are carrying out eugenics and in
[2:55:53.520 --> 2:55:59.200]  game I think it gives you the best picture to understand that overall but
[2:55:59.200 --> 2:56:07.480]  enclosing Paul Watson you know they're going forward with their world
[2:56:07.480 --> 2:56:11.960]  government plan and I just hope that the white supremacists understand out there
[2:56:11.960 --> 2:56:18.600]  that this eugenics model out there is for them as well the elites are going
[2:56:18.600 --> 2:56:23.840]  after whoever they think actually has genetics that they don't control that
[2:56:23.840 --> 2:56:30.360]  quote threatens them they they want to kill the quote subhumans and the you
[2:56:30.360 --> 2:56:33.720]  know quote middle class you know that they see of genetics that might
[2:56:33.720 --> 2:56:38.800]  challenge them and I hope people realize that I mean no matter who you are
[2:56:38.800 --> 2:56:44.200]  99% of us are in deep trouble under the system so we better all come together
[2:56:44.200 --> 2:56:48.520]  against the new world order and then whatever policy the new orders got we
[2:56:48.520 --> 2:56:53.560]  should be against that policy Paul Watson right I also find it interesting to
[2:56:53.560 --> 2:56:59.240]  know from what you were just talking about the Valerie you scored this dang the
[2:56:59.240 --> 2:57:03.920]  top Bilderberg member who founded the precursor for the EU with top Nazis
[2:57:03.920 --> 2:57:08.880]  married his cousin so they all like to keep it in the family don't they they're
[2:57:08.880 --> 2:57:15.120]  really into that but what I would say about the European Union is that from
[2:57:15.120 --> 2:57:21.120]  its ideology in the 40s from its Nazi ideology to its empowerment in the
[2:57:21.120 --> 2:57:28.640]  decade later now the agenda is so advanced that the the manifestations of
[2:57:28.640 --> 2:57:34.960]  its power cannot be hidden anymore which is why people like G. Stardestang
[2:57:34.960 --> 2:57:40.760]  said regarding the Lisbon tree he quote public opinion will be led to adopt
[2:57:40.760 --> 2:57:48.440]  without knowing it the proposals we dare not present to them directly imagine
[2:57:48.440 --> 2:57:51.760]  that so he's saying that basically if we knew what it was really about we'd
[2:57:51.760 --> 2:57:57.640]  never go for it so it's you know but now it's coming out the free speech issue
[2:57:57.640 --> 2:58:03.160]  with the EU I mean the Nazis just killed people who spoke out against them but
[2:58:03.160 --> 2:58:08.080]  the EU's found a more successful method which is just kill their free speech
[2:58:08.080 --> 2:58:13.960]  instead is actually a European court of justice case which establishes the
[2:58:13.960 --> 2:58:19.840]  pretext that it's an illegal act to criticize the EU in fact the EU has
[2:58:19.840 --> 2:58:23.320]  banned you know that's too important stay there let's come back to five more
[2:58:23.320 --> 2:58:27.880]  minutes and I promise I'm gonna get to one final round of calls from Randy

[3:00:01.280 --> 3:00:16.040]  Wow, we are already into the final hour. I make my return to the airwaves
[3:00:16.040 --> 3:00:23.840]  it's 11th today of May 2009. Big news bullets coming up finish up with Paul
[3:00:23.840 --> 3:00:28.520]  Watson Paul Watson you were getting into yeah the European Union's been firing
[3:00:28.520 --> 3:00:32.240]  ministers and members the British government gets fired if they criticize
[3:00:32.240 --> 3:00:36.640]  the EU and now I've seen mainstream news articles where people are arrested
[3:00:36.640 --> 3:00:42.200]  because they use the word homosexual that that's that's a hate crime now
[3:00:42.200 --> 3:00:46.760]  it because it hurts people's feelings if something hurts someone's feelings
[3:00:46.760 --> 3:00:51.200]  even if it's scientific term in like you said the word bluebird that hurts my
[3:00:51.200 --> 3:00:54.800]  feelings you're under arrest they're now proposed a bill it's getting a lot of
[3:00:54.800 --> 3:00:57.640]  cosponsors here in the United States doing the same thing that's coming up
[3:00:57.640 --> 3:01:03.280]  but you were talking about the European Union this is all happening and now in
[3:01:03.280 --> 3:01:07.000]  in London I was reading that every day people are getting stopped and questioned
[3:01:07.000 --> 3:01:12.240]  it's happened to me it's happened to your brother she's announcing your your
[3:01:12.240 --> 3:01:17.360]  home secretary that there's basically no free speech in England I mean this is
[3:01:17.360 --> 3:01:22.880]  getting crazy I mean they're really doing this well the the controversy
[3:01:22.880 --> 3:01:28.400]  regarding my Michael Savage what was not mentioned in that whole controversy was
[3:01:28.400 --> 3:01:34.920]  the fact that he was banned from entering Britain based on an EU law that
[3:01:34.920 --> 3:01:39.680]  frames it that you know political opinions that could be deemed offensive
[3:01:39.680 --> 3:01:45.760]  are illegal because it was under the same laws that a Dutch politician who
[3:01:45.760 --> 3:01:52.040]  called the Korean fascist I believe he was he was barred from entering Britain
[3:01:52.040 --> 3:01:56.440]  as well and that's all done on the EU law yeah I forgot that Paul you got to get
[3:01:56.440 --> 3:02:01.400]  a blurb but that's huge news nobody has pointed that out but you know what from
[3:02:01.400 --> 3:02:05.040]  what I was saying before the manifestations of the EU's power announced
[3:02:05.040 --> 3:02:10.440]  so advanced that they're obviously totalitarian I mean you've got that
[3:02:10.440 --> 3:02:15.720]  with that I posted pictures on prisonplanet.com where the international
[3:02:15.720 --> 3:02:21.280]  EU police because the EU's now got its own international political police force
[3:02:21.280 --> 3:02:27.600]  is firing tear gas serbians who are protesting infringement against their
[3:02:27.600 --> 3:02:34.400]  sovereignty on behalf of the UN created globalist client state Kosovo and it
[3:02:34.400 --> 3:02:40.000]  also came out in mainstream news just today it's up on prisonplanet.com that
[3:02:40.000 --> 3:02:45.400]  they are doing all sorts of other restrictions on free speech all over
[3:02:45.400 --> 3:02:50.800]  Europe right now and the police got caught as we said it was clear from
[3:02:50.800 --> 3:02:55.200]  watching the video posing as protesters attacking other people for
[3:02:55.200 --> 3:03:00.360]  news cameras and then showing IDs and slipping back into police lines yeah
[3:03:00.360 --> 3:03:05.560]  which happens at every major global summit now with the free speech the EU's
[3:03:05.560 --> 3:03:10.200]  also attempted to basically ban the internet they called it a dangerous and
[3:03:10.200 --> 3:03:15.480]  unregulated blogosphere and I make all these points and I try to make it
[3:03:15.480 --> 3:03:18.640]  relevant to people in America because this is exactly what they're planning
[3:03:18.640 --> 3:03:22.640]  with the North American Union it's gonna be set up along the exact it is being
[3:03:22.640 --> 3:03:28.000]  set up along the exact same line and you're gonna see instead of European
[3:03:28.000 --> 3:03:31.600]  international police North American Union international police they're
[3:03:31.600 --> 3:03:37.640]  already issuing a North American Union ID card with TV ads for the new ID card
[3:03:37.640 --> 3:03:41.600]  Paul and they're saying they've got a restrict free speech off Mexican laws
[3:03:41.600 --> 3:03:45.960]  and through treaties the second amendment to unify the laws and they've
[3:03:45.960 --> 3:03:50.320]  introduced the treaty they're the words of CNN they even admit will end the
[3:03:50.320 --> 3:03:55.000]  second amendment that's what I mean Paul it's all happening right now it's
[3:03:55.000 --> 3:04:01.520]  actually happening it's happening and it's a very short leap from international
[3:04:01.520 --> 3:04:05.840]  EU police to North American Union international police it's just a matter
[3:04:05.840 --> 3:04:09.680]  of wearing a different batch and they're in there in Serbia right now
[3:04:09.680 --> 3:04:15.160]  subduing Serbians who are angry about the sovereignty being taken so you know
[3:04:15.160 --> 3:04:19.360]  that's what they're planning for America when they try to amalgamate the US
[3:04:19.360 --> 3:04:23.320]  Canada Canada and Mexico and the the agreements have already been signed
[3:04:23.320 --> 3:04:27.200]  whereby they can use troops in each of those countries I mean that make no
[3:04:27.200 --> 3:04:31.480]  mistake the big foundations have been caught admitting they plan race war in
[3:04:31.480 --> 3:04:35.080]  the Southwest they plan to get against all killing each other we do not want
[3:04:35.080 --> 3:04:38.720]  that ladies and gentlemen Paul Watson unbelievable hour-long report thank you

[3:09:02.120 --> 3:09:07.760]  over YouTube David put up a little backup channel and they suspended that
[3:09:07.760 --> 3:09:11.840]  and shut that down and just said no copyright infringement you just can't
[3:09:11.840 --> 3:09:16.520]  have a site so there's some other channels other people run and it looks
[3:09:16.520 --> 3:09:19.960]  like they're shutting those down looks like Alex Jones is not allowed on
[3:09:19.960 --> 3:09:24.400]  YouTube so a band here in the United States the establishments figured out
[3:09:24.400 --> 3:09:31.040]  that we're having a big effect on them and so now I'm taboo I am the big nasty
[3:09:31.040 --> 3:09:34.720]  evil creature that people can't be allowed to hear because I'll actually
[3:09:34.720 --> 3:09:38.960]  read government documents about how you Genesis Nazis actually run the world
[3:09:38.960 --> 3:09:45.040]  government and they're poisoning you and your family so that is coming up you

[3:10:57.160 --> 3:11:02.960]  in Montana Randy you're on the air go ahead sir yes I we don't get your show
[3:11:02.960 --> 3:11:08.840]  here until like four in the afternoon so I may be way off topic here but last
[3:11:08.840 --> 3:11:15.640]  night CBS News 60 minutes ran what I consider to be the most blatant
[3:11:15.640 --> 3:11:21.920]  fiat that I've ever seen with UAVs and how they single out individual vehicles
[3:11:21.920 --> 3:11:26.780]  and individual pedestrians and just annihilated so they showed you the
[3:11:26.780 --> 3:11:31.160]  drones never hear a merciless so they show the drones that are face scanning us
[3:11:31.160 --> 3:11:38.040]  and tracking slaves and young yes they did and a lot of people would look at
[3:11:38.040 --> 3:11:42.720]  this as just the superior western technology against the eastern barbarians
[3:11:42.720 --> 3:11:47.880]  that we may be fighting but I took it as a direct and it's a direct threat like I
[3:11:47.880 --> 3:11:52.520]  live in a rural Port St. Monty and I shoot in my backyard all the time and
[3:11:52.520 --> 3:11:56.600]  they showed them identifying people from the heat signatures of their weapons
[3:11:56.600 --> 3:12:00.560]  and just you know one second they're standing there in the next second they
[3:12:00.560 --> 3:12:07.160]  spike the whole landscape around them he erupts into like a small nuclear
[3:12:07.160 --> 3:12:11.480]  explosion or something well there is no topic today we're covering news
[3:12:11.480 --> 3:12:16.680]  covering a host of issues tell us what station you listen to us on in Montana

[3:13:53.800 --> 3:13:58.080]  to track and trace who they are now we do it to you Americans because we're the
[3:13:58.080 --> 3:14:04.560]  globalists we've conquered you too and it's the same story over and over and
[3:14:04.560 --> 3:14:08.120]  over and over again you know they they claim they're doing it for people like
[3:14:08.120 --> 3:14:12.400]  oh we're using surveillance satellites for the Russians and the North Koreans and
[3:14:12.400 --> 3:14:15.960]  now all local police departments of homeland security grants they dial into
[3:14:15.960 --> 3:14:21.360]  the live surveillance feeds of the NSA satellites and their land that and NASA's
[3:14:21.360 --> 3:14:27.320]  launching more satellites and the NSA is to watch the American people by the way
[3:14:27.320 --> 3:14:31.040]  we're going to use those satellites to tax you by the mile how does that sound
[3:14:31.040 --> 3:14:35.360]  let's go take another call here let's talk to Ryan and mass Ryan you're on the
[3:14:35.360 --> 3:14:41.560]  air Ryan just hung up Robert in California go ahead good day here Jones
[3:14:41.560 --> 3:14:47.920]  how are you doing good sir okay um what I don't know about the lovers of death
[3:14:47.920 --> 3:14:53.120]  but I do know an Isaiah 28 15 to 17 it does talk about them making a covenant
[3:14:53.120 --> 3:15:00.040]  with death and that held their agreement in the end the passage okay it says
[3:15:00.040 --> 3:15:03.440]  because you have said we have made a covenant with death and with hell we're
[3:15:03.440 --> 3:15:07.840]  at agreement when that overflowing scourge shall pass through it shall not
[3:15:07.840 --> 3:15:11.960]  come unto us for we have made lies or refuge and then their fault so that we
[3:15:11.960 --> 3:15:15.920]  have hit ourselves and this is the floor say the Lord behold I lay in Zion for a
[3:15:15.920 --> 3:15:20.480]  foundation of stone a trite on a precious cornerstone a sure foundation
[3:15:20.480 --> 3:15:24.360]  they heed I believe the show that may case judgment well laid to the line and
[3:15:24.360 --> 3:15:29.840]  righteousness to the plummet and hell shall sweep away the refuge of lies and
[3:15:29.840 --> 3:15:35.000]  water shall over overflow the hiding place and hell in spiritual terms is a
[3:15:35.000 --> 3:15:41.680]  hard word which is truth all right interesting I'm trying to find the exact
[3:15:41.680 --> 3:15:45.520]  passage you know where it says that they were lovers of death you know they love
[3:15:45.520 --> 3:15:50.560]  death well I've been trying to my search in this but I do have a question though I
[3:15:50.560 --> 3:15:57.360]  do have a question on what do you know about the Council of National Policy we
[3:15:57.360 --> 3:16:01.760]  had what's his name what's that professor and I've had him on like 20
[3:16:01.760 --> 3:16:06.560]  times over the years but you bring it up and so I forget his name what is his
[3:16:06.560 --> 3:16:11.640]  name oh man he wrote the politics of heroin it'll pop my head in a second
[3:16:11.640 --> 3:16:16.680]  we've covered it it's like a neocon kind of thing to co-op the conservative
[3:16:16.680 --> 3:16:28.560]  movement set up by set up by some of the folks the the Hunt brothers and well you

[3:16:40.320 --> 3:16:43.680]  I've got a lot of emails about that so last time I had that professor on I asked
[3:16:43.680 --> 3:16:47.280]  him about it the people said that he's saying it's the most powerful group and
[3:16:47.280 --> 3:16:52.000]  a lot of people get get obsessed with left-wing right-wing Catholic Protestant
[3:16:52.000 --> 3:16:56.080]  on and on and on the globalists have tried to infiltrate and take over every
[3:16:56.080 --> 3:17:00.280]  major group that's why you just have to move forward liberty and freedom and a
[3:17:00.280 --> 3:17:04.760]  culture of liberty and freedom but you can tell us about it what do you know
[3:17:04.760 --> 3:17:10.400]  about it well I just know that it's another one of those roundtable groups I

[3:17:30.840 --> 3:17:34.720]  do back then except that they wanted Hitler not to go to war they we just
[3:17:34.720 --> 3:17:39.320]  want to do it by stealth and on negotiation yeah and so that's why they

[3:25:55.280 --> 3:26:02.320]  like time is on our side or is on my side what's the Rolling Stone song we in
[3:26:02.320 --> 3:26:05.880]  fact John pull that up for folks remember we'll pull it up on YouTube and come in
[3:26:05.880 --> 3:26:09.240]  with time is on our side well if we start thinking that way time is on our
[3:26:09.240 --> 3:26:13.480]  side you see and just get involved and realize we have power and can affect
[3:26:13.480 --> 3:26:17.400]  change but yeah they just do that to make any incident you know oh we're here
[3:26:17.400 --> 3:26:21.120]  protecting we're locking things down to introduce the idea of mass shootings and
[3:26:21.120 --> 3:26:24.760]  violence and oh I mean every couple weeks I see him arrest somebody for
[3:26:24.760 --> 3:26:29.280]  writing about violence in their English class and it'll be at first it was he
[3:26:29.280 --> 3:26:35.240]  wrote about the school and said it was a story about hostage you know people
[3:26:35.240 --> 3:26:38.600]  taking over you know repeating some 24 episode and then it was he wrote a story
[3:26:38.600 --> 3:26:41.880]  another one about it zombies at a fictitious school but we're still
[3:26:41.880 --> 3:26:46.320]  arresting him charging him as a terrorist I mean actually saying it was it
[3:26:46.320 --> 3:26:50.400]  was fiction but he's arrested and we commend his grandparents for turning him
[3:26:50.400 --> 3:26:56.440]  in and this the the seniors like God I'm going to prison on and the police are
[3:26:56.440 --> 3:27:01.000]  like we don't care if it's you know a fiction story you're going to present
[3:27:01.000 --> 3:27:05.720]  boy so I mean you know there's no free speech for young people there's not it
[3:27:05.720 --> 3:27:10.640]  just it's just the tyranny is so intense anything else there Randy well I was
[3:27:10.640 --> 3:27:15.720]  talking to my children told them this is just a test and they're you know they're
[3:27:15.720 --> 3:27:21.040]  kind of preparing everyone and it for everyone to become acclimated but on a

[3:39:44.760 --> 3:39:51.000]  Aaron bring you in the photos for my trip okay let's so imagine I think all
[3:39:51.000 --> 3:39:53.640]  a few days ago camping in the last few days we go to the beach so we're on a
[3:39:53.640 --> 3:39:59.280]  road trip and I'm driving to the national seashore down by
[3:39:59.280 --> 3:40:07.000]  Port Aransas Texas Corpus Christi or two of the nearest towns and I go there
[3:40:07.000 --> 3:40:12.920]  Saturday and I'm pulling up and I pull up and I notice there's a camera right
[3:40:12.920 --> 3:40:19.800]  in my face at the entrance to the seashore I guess you put it on flicker
[3:40:19.800 --> 3:40:25.600]  so they're little bitty cruddy photos oh man can we just upload them to just on
[3:40:25.600 --> 3:40:31.440]  our own server to a page so we have them big oh whatever go ahead and put it up
[3:40:31.440 --> 3:40:36.760]  on screen though now now this is only one nest of them so so you drive up to
[3:40:36.760 --> 3:40:44.160]  the national seashore which is just a you know national part and this is what
[3:40:44.160 --> 3:40:47.760]  happens after you leave the guard check they take your 10 bucks per vehicle to
[3:40:47.760 --> 3:40:52.560]  be there for the day and you drive past them and then right there there are all
[3:40:52.560 --> 3:40:56.880]  these cameras to catch every conceivable license plate that is license plate
[3:40:56.880 --> 3:41:02.200]  scanning software all the big federal cameras they admit run through and and
[3:41:02.200 --> 3:41:05.400]  run your license plate so you're having your background check run you can
[3:41:05.400 --> 3:41:09.600]  Google Florida town runs every plate that comes through it that was I've been
[3:41:09.600 --> 3:41:12.840]  talking about this for more than five six seven years when it finally came out
[3:41:12.840 --> 3:41:17.120]  four or five years ago that Indiana and Texas and all these small towns not just
[3:41:17.120 --> 3:41:21.600]  states had federally paid for software where every car that drives to the town
[3:41:21.600 --> 3:41:26.400]  the plates are run guilty until proven innocent and now police cars have got it
[3:41:26.400 --> 3:41:30.280]  in Houston in Dallas and everywhere else and that's what those are the so so
[3:41:30.280 --> 3:41:33.840]  you're having your background run they don't tell you this is being done yet
[3:41:33.840 --> 3:41:37.560]  you they're running to see of the car stole and that's how they introduced the
[3:41:37.560 --> 3:41:46.120]  slaves and and so so this is driving up to it this is driving up to it no that's
[3:41:46.120 --> 3:41:50.520]  actually leaving because I didn't get photos at first when I drove through but
[3:41:50.520 --> 3:41:55.040]  but but right when you're there they're just in your face you're paying and
[3:41:55.040 --> 3:41:58.200]  there's a big camera right here and it's got infrared in case it was nighttime it
[3:41:58.200 --> 3:42:01.880]  wasn't but it's got infrared arrays on it and they're asking hey what do you hear
[3:42:01.880 --> 3:42:06.720]  for all here and then ask you a few more questions because everybody's a secret
[3:42:06.720 --> 3:42:09.720]  agent you know they all watch Jack Bauer at night and they're all fighting out
[3:42:09.720 --> 3:42:14.040]  kind of together and you can you and you can't go to Boliver now because
[3:42:14.040 --> 3:42:17.080]  literally there were Muslims with headdresses and me and I'm not saying
[3:42:17.080 --> 3:42:20.800]  they're terrorists the point is they were all must be a lot of Muslims that
[3:42:20.800 --> 3:42:23.840]  live in Galveston now they were all going over to Boliver I go back across the
[3:42:23.840 --> 3:42:27.480]  Galveston to eat at night had my children they pull me over my kids tear
[3:42:27.480 --> 3:42:31.360]  the car apart search everything and I'd sit there and go why does this happen
[3:42:31.360 --> 3:42:36.880]  every time I drive across every time having like six times and they would
[3:42:36.880 --> 3:42:39.120]  just say well we're not allowed to let you know the profiling and I said well
[3:42:39.120 --> 3:42:44.040]  I see what the profiling is you're searching black people and white people
[3:42:44.040 --> 3:42:47.440]  and and anybody that looks like they're obviously from the United States but I
[3:42:47.440 --> 3:42:50.600]  go all these illegal aliens why don't you search them I mean I'd point it
[3:42:50.600 --> 3:42:54.240]  obviously legal aliens with cowboy hats and work boots on a workman you know
[3:42:54.240 --> 3:42:59.400]  99% chance they were illegal and we don't we're told what to search and
[3:42:59.400 --> 3:43:05.320]  it's me it's the milk cow I'm the scene is the big fat blubber whale to be
[3:43:05.320 --> 3:43:10.200]  sucked off of the cowardly stupid dumb America and there's nothing I won't take
[3:43:10.200 --> 3:43:14.040]  any legal aliens in the Arabs and everybody else who even in their false
[3:43:14.040 --> 3:43:17.320]  paradigm you know of the terrorists are under every rock oh my god there's
[3:43:17.320 --> 3:43:21.680]  probably one under my desk there is one right there you know they they have to
[3:43:21.680 --> 3:43:27.800]  be left alone it's dumb milk cows you're a Hispanic family driving a nice car
[3:43:27.800 --> 3:43:31.440]  clearly American you're out of the car pulled out I got was searched six times
[3:43:31.440 --> 3:43:35.720]  I'd sit there for 30 minutes while this went on so I was watching it old old
[3:43:35.720 --> 3:43:40.840]  couples on canes with RVs and they and they I've got some video of this way but
