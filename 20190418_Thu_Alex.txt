[00:00.000 --> 00:22.880]  As you know, one of the primary purposes of the Special Counsel's investigation was to
[00:22.880 --> 00:29.200]  determine whether President Trump's campaign or any individual associated with it conspired
[00:29.200 --> 00:36.840]  or coordinated with the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.
[00:36.840 --> 00:42.960]  Volume 1 of the Special Counsel's report describes the results of that investigation.
[00:42.960 --> 00:48.240]  As you will see, the Special Counsel's report states that his, quote, investigation did
[00:48.240 --> 00:54.280]  not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian
[00:54.280 --> 00:59.200]  government in its election interference activities.
[00:59.200 --> 01:04.600]  I am sure that all Americans share my concern about the efforts of the Russian government
[01:04.600 --> 01:08.240]  to interfere in our presidential election.
[01:08.240 --> 01:14.080]  As the Special Counsel report makes clear, the Russian government sought to interfere
[01:14.080 --> 01:16.680]  in our election process.
[01:16.680 --> 01:22.080]  But thanks to the Special Counsel's thorough investigation, we now know that the Russian
[01:22.080 --> 01:28.560]  operatives who perpetrated these schemes did not have the cooperation of President Trump
[01:28.560 --> 01:35.080]  or the Trump campaign or the knowing assistance of any other American for that matter.
[01:35.080 --> 01:42.120]  That is something that all Americans can and should be grateful to have confirmed.
[01:42.120 --> 01:46.880]  The Special Counsel report outlines two main efforts by the Russian government to influence
[01:46.880 --> 01:49.280]  the 2016 election.
[01:49.280 --> 01:55.440]  First, the report details efforts by the Internet Research Agency, a Russian company
[01:55.440 --> 02:01.720]  with close ties to the Russian government, to sow social discord among American voters
[02:01.720 --> 02:06.720]  through disinformation and social media operations.
[02:06.720 --> 02:11.720]  Following a thorough investigation of this disinformation campaign, the Special Counsel
[02:11.720 --> 02:18.440]  brought charges in federal court against several Russian nationals and entities for their respective
[02:18.440 --> 02:20.760]  roles in this scheme.
[02:20.760 --> 02:26.680]  Those charges remain pending, and the individual defendants remain at large.
[02:26.680 --> 02:32.640]  But the Special Counsel found no evidence that any American, including anyone associated
[02:32.640 --> 02:39.360]  with the Trump campaign, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government or the IRA in
[02:39.360 --> 02:40.840]  this illegal scheme.
[02:40.840 --> 02:46.240]  Again, the Special Counsel's report did not find any evidence that members of the Trump
[02:46.240 --> 02:52.000]  campaign or anyone associated with the campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian
[02:52.000 --> 02:55.400]  government in these hacking operations.
[02:55.400 --> 03:01.200]  In other words, there was no evidence of the Trump campaign collusion with the Russian
[03:01.200 --> 03:02.600]  government's hacking.
[03:02.600 --> 03:07.280]  Here, too, the Special Counsel's report did not find that any person associated with
[03:07.280 --> 03:13.200]  the Trump campaign illegally participated in the dissemination of the materials.
[03:13.200 --> 03:19.000]  Finally, the Special Counsel investigated a number of links or contacts between the
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.520]  Trump campaign officials and individuals connected with the Russian government during
[03:24.520 --> 03:28.800]  the 2016 presidential campaign.
[03:28.800 --> 03:34.680]  After reviewing these contacts, the Special Counsel did not find any conspiracy to violate
[03:34.680 --> 03:40.760]  U.S. law involving Russian-linked persons and any persons associated with the Trump
[03:40.760 --> 03:41.760]  campaign.
[03:41.760 --> 03:45.640]  Now, let's back it up 10 seconds.
[03:45.640 --> 03:46.640]  That's the bottom line.
[03:46.640 --> 03:55.040]  So, as I always say, Trump will be cleared in triplicate and has been cleared in triplicate.
[03:55.040 --> 04:02.320]  That's a legal term of conspiracy, collusion, or coordination.
[04:02.320 --> 04:04.600]  You just noticed him use the triplicate.
[04:04.600 --> 04:11.200]  Now, what's interesting, if we put that still, for TV viewers, of the new attorney general
[04:11.200 --> 04:19.080]  with the deputy attorney general Rosenstein behind him, Rosenstein was a ringleader in
[04:19.080 --> 04:21.800]  the 25th Amendment takedown coup.
[04:21.800 --> 04:27.600]  He was involved with other members of the Justice Department or, and others, transferring
[04:27.600 --> 04:35.120]  the money to steal infusion GPS to create the fraud.
[04:35.120 --> 04:36.120]  Think about that.
[04:36.120 --> 04:41.440]  So, they're lucky that they're all not going to prison right now, and they should be.
[04:41.440 --> 04:45.840]  So they got caught engaged in an attempted coup, and they need to all be sent to prison.
[04:45.840 --> 04:49.160]  So, with the left up there running around saying, oh, they're covered up for Trump.
[04:49.160 --> 04:50.760]  No, they're covered up for themselves.
[04:50.760 --> 04:51.760]  They got caught.
[04:51.760 --> 04:53.200]  They got beaten.
[04:53.200 --> 04:55.080]  And they're lucky they're not all going to prison.
[04:55.080 --> 04:56.080]  But some are.
[04:56.080 --> 05:00.520]  Tomorrow's news today, straight ahead.
[05:00.520 --> 05:08.880]  Being in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is, but a lot of us on the big island
[05:08.880 --> 05:14.280]  rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[05:14.280 --> 05:19.680]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[05:19.680 --> 05:21.240]  to unhealthy levels.
[05:21.240 --> 05:27.760]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[05:27.760 --> 05:31.760]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[05:31.760 --> 05:33.080]  in the rainwater.
[05:33.080 --> 05:38.480]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[05:38.480 --> 05:44.560]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[05:44.560 --> 05:49.400]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[05:49.400 --> 05:54.320]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater
[05:54.320 --> 05:55.320]  supply.
[05:55.320 --> 06:02.320]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[06:02.320 --> 06:13.680]  Waging war on corruption.
[06:13.680 --> 06:25.160]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[06:25.160 --> 06:34.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide Thursday, April 18th, 2019.
[06:34.160 --> 06:39.600]  And the whole world is breathlessly going over the Robert Mueller report two years in
[06:39.600 --> 06:46.400]  the making, triggered by high-level Democrats inside the FBI Justice Department using taxpayer
[06:46.400 --> 06:51.200]  money to pay for a fake dossier.
[06:51.200 --> 06:55.760]  So as dredgerport.com says, it's Mueller time.
[06:55.760 --> 06:58.400]  We have the full report right over here on my desk.
[06:58.400 --> 07:01.760]  We've already been scanning through it, but it's really just confirming everything we
[07:01.760 --> 07:05.760]  already knew from the congressional testimony, from the text messages and all the rest of
[07:05.760 --> 07:15.200]  it, that this was a giant frame up, an attempt to take down the duly elected president and
[07:15.200 --> 07:18.920]  overthrow the election of the people.
[07:18.920 --> 07:22.080]  Then they were going to delegitimize the entire 2016 election.
[07:22.080 --> 07:26.680]  The Democrats had contacted all 50 state attorney generals and told them under an executive
[07:26.680 --> 07:32.680]  order of Obama, that Trump's never reversed strangely enough, that they were going to
[07:32.680 --> 07:37.960]  federalize elections in the future after the 2016 election had been overturned.
[07:37.960 --> 07:39.280]  Now that was the pipe dream.
[07:39.280 --> 07:43.200]  That was the pie in the sky projection the Democrats wanted.
[07:43.200 --> 07:47.000]  That was what they attempted and they believed they could do it.
[07:47.000 --> 07:48.200]  Now where are they?
[07:48.200 --> 07:54.880]  At all these different people, all Obama's horses and all Obama's men trying to put
[07:54.880 --> 08:00.240]  Humpty Dumpty back together again and engaging in massive fraud and in massive lies and turning
[08:00.240 --> 08:06.880]  the CIA and other agencies loose on Trump's associates, trying to set them up as Russian
[08:06.880 --> 08:12.200]  agents sending informants in, twisting arms, threatening everyone they knew to make contact
[08:12.200 --> 08:19.360]  with any Trump supporter of any renowned, yours truly, and trying to get us to make
[08:19.360 --> 08:21.840]  contact with the Russians.
[08:21.840 --> 08:26.200]  But really it was the Democrats inside the FBI.
[08:26.200 --> 08:35.400]  And so this is where we are in the middle of April 2019 and the Democrats don't know
[08:35.400 --> 08:42.480]  what to do because now all their other fake investigations that scooped up data on Trump
[08:42.480 --> 08:47.760]  associates in non-espionage related areas like not paying taxes and things, that is
[08:47.760 --> 08:51.760]  all tainted because it came from a fraudulent investigation.
[08:51.760 --> 09:02.200]  Plus, Trump has the deep state, the Democrats, the Rod Rosenstein's, the James Comey's,
[09:02.200 --> 09:08.840]  the Andrew McCabe's, the Bruce Ores, he has them all by, there's a word for it in Spanish,
[09:08.840 --> 09:17.320]  the Cajones, meaning the Wavos, meaning the Testicles, the Shorthairs.
[09:17.320 --> 09:23.680]  Now that Russia collusion is a proven lie, when do the trials for treason begin?
[09:23.680 --> 09:32.560]  Remember when Trump tweeted that last year, I wonder, will he be tweeting it again?
[09:32.560 --> 09:36.640]  I know we should post that to the front page of infowars.com, remember you're a radio
[09:36.640 --> 09:40.400]  listener, that's wonderful, you're the majority of our audience, we also have simulcast at
[09:40.400 --> 09:43.240]  infowars.com forward slash show.
[09:43.240 --> 09:49.400]  And so we're going to go over all the different clips from the 22 minute press conference.
[09:49.400 --> 09:53.960]  In fact, I think the best thing to do is come back on the other side and just play the press
[09:53.960 --> 10:00.480]  conference end to end with a few stops where I add some context to it.
[10:00.480 --> 10:06.440]  That's the best way to do this, that's what a regular old smart news show would do.
[10:06.440 --> 10:15.440]  So I'm going to cover it and it is historic because they illegally spot on the president
[10:15.440 --> 10:20.200]  when he was a candidate, got caught doing it, launched a bigger investigation to cover
[10:20.200 --> 10:22.160]  that up and try to unseat the president.
[10:22.160 --> 10:32.800]  It was a bold, hutzpah, bravada, hubris, wild-eyed, gambler type behavior.
[10:32.800 --> 10:39.520]  And now it's been done so crudely, so ham-fistedly, because they were always sure Hillary was going
[10:39.520 --> 10:40.520]  to win.
[10:40.520 --> 10:43.320]  So it didn't matter how out in the open they did it.
[10:43.320 --> 10:47.040]  Even Bragg, when he was president-elect, don't worry, he'll never be seated.
[10:47.040 --> 10:52.720]  It's a Nancy Pelosi's daughter on Fox News, Obama administration's handing the intelligence
[10:52.720 --> 10:56.080]  over to the media, the Trump-Sarrussian agent.
[10:56.080 --> 11:00.040]  Wow, but it wasn't evidence.
[11:00.040 --> 11:05.880]  It was stuff the Democrats inside the FBI, inside the Justice Department, inside the
[11:05.880 --> 11:08.000]  intelligence agencies.
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.120]  A member of the Socialist and Communist 50 years ago said, we can't overthrow America
[11:12.120 --> 11:18.160]  from without, we're going to take over the judiciary, we're going to take over the seminary,
[11:18.160 --> 11:23.040]  the churches, the religion, we're going to take over the educational system, the colleges
[11:23.040 --> 11:27.240]  and secondary education, but also primary education.
[11:27.240 --> 11:33.000]  And we're going to take control of the media even more, and that's how we'll overthrow
[11:33.000 --> 11:34.520]  America is psychologically.
[11:34.520 --> 11:38.320]  And in 2019, they say shaying America exists as bad.
[11:38.320 --> 11:42.200]  Thomas Jefferson's evil, George Washington's bad, the American flag's evil.
[11:42.200 --> 11:45.360]  You want to trigger a leftist?
[11:45.360 --> 11:50.600]  Say America's great, it's like a cross to a vampire, literally.
[11:50.600 --> 11:55.440]  They flip out because they're anti-Americans, they are the anti-American globalist party.
[11:55.440 --> 12:04.640]  Their ethos, their blood supply, their oxygen, their very tissue is conquering this country.
[12:04.640 --> 12:08.520]  It's amazing.
[12:08.520 --> 12:12.280]  But look at this story out of the Washington Free Beacon.
[12:12.280 --> 12:19.760]  It's a great report, we've linked it up on Infowars.com, US intelligence, institutionally
[12:19.760 --> 12:27.920]  politicized towards Democrats, Bill Gertz, great writer, national intelligence writer
[12:27.920 --> 12:29.080]  wrote that story.
[12:29.080 --> 12:35.400]  And I like, I like Drudge's headline better for the article, CIA, intelligence agencies
[12:35.400 --> 12:41.880]  have become bastions of liberals, but they're really anti-American leftist who have an ethos
[12:41.880 --> 12:52.680]  of will to power and their rightful intellectual birthright to run everything.
[12:52.680 --> 12:57.000]  And they're being rejected and they don't know what to do, but they've got to be dug
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.800]  out of these agencies, they've got to be removed.
[12:59.800 --> 13:05.720]  I have enjoyed the last three years being attacked by these agencies.
[13:05.720 --> 13:09.960]  I've enjoyed watching congressional hearings where they call me a Russian agent out of
[13:09.960 --> 13:12.280]  hand, I've never called to testify.
[13:12.280 --> 13:16.400]  I have witnessed their criminal arrogance.
[13:16.400 --> 13:20.320]  And you know what, thanks to your help and your support and your prayers, so far we've
[13:20.320 --> 13:21.320]  overcome it.
[13:21.320 --> 13:28.640]  So I thank you, the audience, I thank this great crew, and I thank number one God above
[13:28.640 --> 13:32.280]  and my family for putting up with me, but God number one.
[13:32.280 --> 13:35.560]  So thank you, God, thank you for sending your son, Jesus Christ.
[13:35.560 --> 13:39.120]  Thank you for your providence and leading, guiding and directing us.
[13:39.120 --> 13:45.160]  And just for all the, what the common person would call good luck, so I thank you, God.
[13:45.160 --> 13:48.880]  But there's still major battles to come, but you can see America fighting back from the
[13:48.880 --> 13:54.280]  dead again, because as Von Bismarck said, God loves children, drunks in the United States
[13:54.280 --> 13:55.280]  of America.
[13:55.280 --> 14:00.080]  Many a foreign leader has marveled at the United States luck over and over again.
[14:00.080 --> 14:06.480]  It's called providence, it's called manifest destiny, it's called a plan for us that is
[14:06.480 --> 14:09.800]  not yet been seen in the future.
[14:09.800 --> 14:15.480]  That's why all the controlled seminaries from the Rockefeller Foundation tell you that
[14:15.480 --> 14:19.160]  the United States is not in prophecy and it's all a lie.
[14:19.160 --> 14:22.040]  The United States is critical in prophecy.
[14:22.040 --> 14:26.360]  Now continuing, we're going to get into the criminal activity proven by Mueller's report,
[14:26.360 --> 14:31.760]  because it's already coming out, it's already been documented of the illegal Democrats paying
[14:31.760 --> 14:36.800]  for fake intelligence that they then claim somebody else produced.
[14:36.800 --> 14:41.280]  That's called fraud to a court, that's called perjury, that's called conspiracy.
[14:41.280 --> 14:42.280]  It's amazing.
[14:42.280 --> 14:43.280]  That's coming up.
[14:43.280 --> 14:48.440]  Don't do not forget, we're in an information war and spreading the word is paramount.
[14:48.440 --> 14:53.480]  The left wants to intimidate and bully everybody into not having free speech.
[14:53.480 --> 14:56.680]  That's why it's so critical that you stand up to those bullies and realize that when
[14:56.680 --> 15:00.920]  you wear an info wars dot com or attorney response team or a Molan Lave shirt or one
[15:00.920 --> 15:05.400]  of hundreds of amazing shirts, many of them limited edition, like 10 new limited edition
[15:05.400 --> 15:06.400]  shirts.

[15:09.400 --> 15:11.280]  keep those as a mainstay.

[17:28.960 --> 17:34.200]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[17:34.200 --> 17:35.200]  the world.
[17:35.200 --> 17:38.280]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[17:38.280 --> 17:44.240]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars one and two left England broken.
[17:44.240 --> 17:48.040]  Its former colony, the U.S. had to save the empire.
[17:48.040 --> 17:49.240]  Was there ever a vote?
[17:49.240 --> 17:50.560]  Who do we fight for?

[20:55.400 --> 21:04.480]  The Mueller report, he's the God, the left that once hated intelligence agencies hated
[21:04.480 --> 21:10.720]  the FBI, with a passion now just embraces it because major studies show and Bill Goertz
[21:10.720 --> 21:18.480]  has written about it today, a story US intelligence institutionally politicized towards Democrats.
[21:18.480 --> 21:23.320]  Just like 96% of reportage on Trump is negative.
[21:23.320 --> 21:27.520]  Just like 99% of the reportage on me is negative.
[21:27.520 --> 21:31.600]  But now people know they're a pack of liars, so they just invert whatever the liars say
[21:31.600 --> 21:33.640]  and that it's back pointing the right direction.
[21:33.640 --> 21:35.000]  That's a good rule of thumb.
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.840]  So I have here the 400 plus page report.
[21:38.840 --> 21:42.280]  We've got a lot of sections we're going to go through, but I think we should just go
[21:42.280 --> 21:46.840]  to the press conference of the new attorney general, Mr. Barr, and then go through it
[21:46.840 --> 21:47.840]  piece by piece.
[21:47.840 --> 21:51.120]  But I first want to make this declaration.
[21:51.120 --> 22:03.280]  This report, the Mueller report right here, this report is a total cover up and a white
[22:03.280 --> 22:04.280]  wash.
[22:04.280 --> 22:14.040]  That's right, not of Trump's imaginary crimes or espionage, but of the Democrats.
[22:14.040 --> 22:17.520]  All you can know is look at Rod Rosenstein standing there behind the attorney general
[22:17.520 --> 22:21.720]  today when he tried to overthrow the president in the 25th amendment coup, when he was involved
[22:21.720 --> 22:29.160]  in the whole thing with Comey and McCabe and or the rest of them, it's all come out paying
[22:29.160 --> 22:36.280]  taxpayer money to Fusion GPS to make up the dossier and then many of their wives worked
[22:36.280 --> 22:37.520]  at Fusion GPS.
[22:37.520 --> 22:40.960]  It wasn't just that they were going to set the president up because they thought he was
[22:40.960 --> 22:44.680]  bad and wanted to get rid of him and because he wasn't part of their club.
[22:44.680 --> 22:51.240]  They also paid their husbands and wives, at least four of them we know of, up to a half
[22:51.240 --> 22:58.920]  million dollars apiece, just like Hillary gave millions to McCabe's wife while this
[22:58.920 --> 23:00.840]  was all going on to her campaign.
[23:00.840 --> 23:05.480]  There's no end to these people's criminal activity.
[23:05.480 --> 23:12.880]  So the press conference should be about how the criminal conspiracy has been discovered
[23:12.880 --> 23:13.880]  and proven.
[23:13.880 --> 23:17.440]  There's some of that in there but it's already public that Mueller knows he can't hide.
[23:17.440 --> 23:26.720]  They try to explain it away but they failed to set anybody up for Russiagate because they
[23:26.720 --> 23:30.440]  were the ones involved with any country that wanted to pay them money to sell this country
[23:30.440 --> 23:31.440]  out.
[23:31.440 --> 23:36.440]  Mueller was hired as the assassin and the executioner.
[23:36.440 --> 23:40.520]  And so when all of this information came out because Trump and myself and people like
[23:40.520 --> 23:45.520]  Sean Hannity and you, the audience, didn't roll over to them in their fraud and kept
[23:45.520 --> 23:49.840]  fighting back, they knew the public didn't buy it and they knew more whistleblowers were
[23:49.840 --> 23:59.080]  coming out and they knew that some of the FBI agents ended up testifying to Congress
[23:59.080 --> 24:02.360]  in secret about the whole conspiracy.
[24:02.360 --> 24:13.160]  And when that happened last year with Lisa Page, namely, it was jig is up, you're caught,
[24:13.160 --> 24:20.320]  cops bust in and the robbers are in the bank vault loading, loading their sacks.
[24:20.320 --> 24:24.760]  It's called being caught red handed.
[24:24.760 --> 24:28.120]  Red handed, you just killed somebody and there's blood on your hands.
[24:28.120 --> 24:33.160]  Red handed or open and shut.
[24:33.160 --> 24:34.720]  They're guilty on the face of it.
[24:34.720 --> 24:39.520]  Their own text admit we've got an insurance policy and they start getting scarier and
[24:39.520 --> 24:40.520]  scarier.
[24:40.520 --> 24:43.280]  Once he's already the president, they're like, God, there's nothing here.
[24:43.280 --> 24:44.280]  This is really dangerous.
[24:44.280 --> 24:48.000]  They're like, hold the course, Clapper and Brennan and Obama.
[24:48.000 --> 24:49.000]  They're still with us.
[24:49.000 --> 24:50.240]  We've still got our stay behind groups.
[24:50.240 --> 24:51.240]  We're embedded.
[24:51.240 --> 24:52.240]  We've got the media.
[24:52.240 --> 24:55.400]  So the whole media was a big con game about how Trump's going to prison.
[24:55.400 --> 24:56.400]  Yay.
[24:56.400 --> 24:57.400]  Everybody's turning against him.
[24:57.400 --> 25:05.560]  I found out it was a giant whisper campaign, but it didn't work.
[25:05.560 --> 25:07.320]  And so yeah, it's all in the report.
[25:07.320 --> 25:10.720]  There's a lot of new stuff in here.
[25:10.720 --> 25:11.720]  There's a lot of stuff in here.
[25:11.720 --> 25:21.480]  Oh, yeah, they've even got all the text messages and all the rest of it and phone logs showing
[25:21.480 --> 25:27.920]  all of them on the phone.
[25:27.920 --> 25:29.880]  That all came via judicial watching their lawsuits.
[25:29.880 --> 25:35.040]  So a beautiful day, ladies and gentlemen, but understand it doesn't go far enough.
[25:35.040 --> 25:40.600]  And if this reports anything, it is a whitewash.
[25:40.600 --> 25:43.000]  It's much worse than this.
[25:43.000 --> 25:48.560]  The Democrats better hope and pray all these black dot areas don't come out because Trump
[25:48.560 --> 25:52.360]  has the deep state by the way those rancheros.
[25:52.360 --> 25:56.200]  Here's some of it.
[25:56.200 --> 25:59.640]  The greatest political hoax of all time.
[25:59.640 --> 26:02.400]  Crimes were committed by crooked, dirty cops and DNC.
[26:02.400 --> 26:03.400]  The Democrats.
[26:03.400 --> 26:08.760]  There's another Donald Trump treat.
[26:08.760 --> 26:10.480]  I said treat, which is a good Freudian slip.
[26:10.480 --> 26:11.480]  It is a treat.
[26:11.480 --> 26:12.480]  Tweet.
[26:12.480 --> 26:13.480]  Wow.
[26:13.480 --> 26:21.600]  I made 11 payments to fake dossier, discredited author, Trump hater Christopher Steele at
[26:21.600 --> 26:24.040]  one American news network and judicial watch.
[26:24.040 --> 26:30.400]  The witch hunt has been a total fraud on your president and the American people.
[26:30.400 --> 26:36.280]  It was brought to you by dirty cops, crooked Hillary and the DNC.
[26:36.280 --> 26:40.480]  So we're going to go to break and come right back with the full press conference.
[26:40.480 --> 26:46.720]  I'm going to try to make limited comments during it, but this is a big deal.
[26:46.720 --> 26:52.320]  Press conference just happened about an hour ago and don't forget we cover it here live.
[26:52.320 --> 26:58.480]  They have a night show from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. right before me, always on top of whatever
[26:58.480 --> 27:02.640]  the latest breaking news and information as you can tune into our live streams, you'll
[27:02.640 --> 27:08.560]  have us covering it live or right afterwards live so that our stations can pick that up.
[27:08.560 --> 27:09.960]  All our great radio and TV stations.
[27:09.960 --> 27:15.200]  Again, as we go to break, please don't forget it's Lister support that makes this all possible.
[27:15.200 --> 27:17.760]  And if you'll just get your fluoride free toothpaste, it's the highest quality four
[27:17.760 --> 27:21.640]  to five o'clock little silver iodine, super blue, the mouthwash, all of it.
[27:21.640 --> 27:24.000]  There's no fillers in this toothpaste.
[27:24.000 --> 27:25.000]  It's concentrated.
[27:25.000 --> 27:26.000]  It's amazing.
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.480]  If you just sign up for auto ship and get it each month or every two months, you get
[27:28.480 --> 27:34.440]  10% off and you don't have to remember to support the broadcast, your high quality coffee

[27:51.600 --> 27:58.040]  The new big sale is on DNA force plus now even stronger in each capital with the PQQ,
[27:58.040 --> 28:02.440]  the CoQ 10 and so many other factors for your nerves, for your body, for your mitochondria.
[28:02.440 --> 28:07.400]  It's been proven to make telomeres last longer or shorten slower, which is the same thing
[28:07.400 --> 28:08.400]  as making them extend.
[28:08.400 --> 28:10.880]  And we all know what happens to telomeres.
[28:10.880 --> 28:17.120]  They are able to divide so many times and then they start mutating and then bye bye.
[28:17.120 --> 28:22.560]  So DNA force is as close to the fountain of youth as there is DNA force plus all these
[28:22.560 --> 28:26.760]  big billionaire globals are taking similar formulas that cost them $500 a bottle.
[28:26.760 --> 28:31.360]  It's only $119 is our most expensive product because it costs thousands and thousands
[28:31.360 --> 28:34.440]  of dollars a kilo just for the PQQ, the CoQ 10.
[28:34.440 --> 28:39.040]  It's not synthetic like the garbage that costs even more at the store.

[31:00.840 --> 31:07.400]  There is a publicly admitted international plan to shut down nationalist pro-free market,
[31:07.400 --> 31:10.560]  pro-western speech all across the world.
[31:10.560 --> 31:15.400]  I don't want to say I'm honored, but in a way I am, to have been chosen first last year
[31:15.400 --> 31:18.440]  to be de-platformed, then they set the precedent.
[31:18.440 --> 31:23.280]  Now if you try to tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert, they
[31:23.280 --> 31:24.760]  take you off the internet.
[31:24.760 --> 31:30.160]  Now Google announced just today that they're not going to take Christian advertising of
[31:30.160 --> 31:35.560]  most types on their platform because it upsets the San Francisco Google employees.
[31:35.560 --> 31:41.440]  Our country and the world more and more is in the grip of anti-free speech, hyper-leftist,
[31:41.440 --> 31:46.400]  anti-human, transhumanist who literally think they own and run our lives.
[31:46.400 --> 31:51.440]  And if we keep bowing to these cults, the cancer that is San Francisco and many of these
[31:51.440 --> 31:55.440]  big universities is going to be the operating system of the planet.
[31:55.440 --> 31:58.960]  Humanity must awaken and say no to these control freaks.
[31:58.960 --> 32:05.760]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed
[32:05.760 --> 32:13.720]  that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[32:13.720 --> 32:21.160]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant, leftist authoritarians
[32:21.160 --> 32:26.040]  like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[32:26.040 --> 32:27.960]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[32:27.960 --> 32:31.160]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[32:31.160 --> 32:36.400]  And that's why the globalist, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[32:36.400 --> 32:41.480]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very
[32:41.480 --> 32:42.920]  sovereignty away.
[32:42.920 --> 32:45.200]  This country is in a war.
[32:45.200 --> 32:49.040]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't
[32:49.040 --> 32:52.120]  spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we
[32:52.120 --> 32:56.920]  have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water, I'm in your hands, you're in
[32:56.920 --> 33:03.600]  my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you.
[33:03.600 --> 33:18.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:18.400 --> 33:22.600]  Standing behind the General Bar is Rosenstein, one of the key ringletters in the trees.
[33:22.600 --> 33:30.400]  There lies, and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[33:30.400 --> 33:35.080]  Everybody's saying, oh my gosh, Mueller whitewash, no, it was a coup.
[33:35.080 --> 33:37.800]  He was hired to prosecute it.
[33:37.800 --> 33:42.080]  It failed, and now I guarantee you, a lot of you were going to prison.
[33:42.080 --> 33:44.680]  Oh, does Trump's rhetoric is getting more intense?
[33:44.680 --> 33:49.680]  Because Trump knows he has to dig these criminals out of the government, or there's no hope.
[33:49.680 --> 33:53.920]  New York Times wrote a huge fantasy piece about me that I'll cover next hour, because
[33:53.920 --> 33:59.560]  it's so illustrative of their delusion, exactly as I've been saying.
[33:59.560 --> 34:09.080]  They say in this, if we can't destroy Trump, the consolation prize is destroying Alex Jones.
[34:09.080 --> 34:15.360]  It's a religion of losers that are into hurting America and prosperity, and they really put
[34:15.360 --> 34:19.600]  their foot in it in this document.
[34:19.600 --> 34:24.560]  They say that I'm making it up that there were reports of a man in camouflage, tactical
[34:24.560 --> 34:26.920]  gear in the woods that was arrested.
[34:26.920 --> 34:35.640]  I went and dug up the newscast that show it all, and I can do it with everything they
[34:35.640 --> 34:36.880]  say.
[34:36.880 --> 34:39.400]  It's unbelievable.
[34:39.400 --> 34:40.400]  That's next hour.
[34:40.400 --> 34:46.560]  Along with, oh, you didn't hear about it, because it got almost no attention, a leftist
[34:46.560 --> 34:58.040]  philosophy professor, Mark, I don't know how you pronounce this, Lamporello, had two big
[34:58.040 --> 35:04.640]  gas tanks of gasoline, lighter food and lighters, was caught inside with it spilt on the ground
[35:04.640 --> 35:11.080]  inside St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York, and then he said to police while I was just
[35:11.080 --> 35:16.400]  trying to find gas for my vehicle, they have on the surveillance footage pulling up, getting
[35:16.400 --> 35:20.280]  out of the van, going in with it, and, of course, his vehicle had put in a gas.
[35:20.280 --> 35:23.600]  If he would have been successful, though, he would have been on the news that it was
[35:23.600 --> 35:30.760]  not arson, and anyone investigating it is a terrorist.
[35:30.760 --> 35:37.000]  But he didn't get away with it here, and isn't it funny that I had Leo Zagami investigate
[35:37.000 --> 35:38.000]  a journalist to understand.
[35:38.000 --> 35:42.480]  He said, I bet it's a devil worship or a leftist, not just a Muslim.
[35:42.480 --> 35:45.920]  He said they've been wanting to burn down all the cathedrals for a while, because I expect
[35:45.920 --> 35:47.760]  them to start burning more down.
[35:47.760 --> 35:52.200]  Oh, and then a leftist philosophy professor.
[35:52.200 --> 35:54.880]  Most of them, you scratch out of the surface Aleister Crowleyites.
[35:54.880 --> 35:58.920]  That's a big ritual to burn down a cathedral.
[35:58.920 --> 36:04.480]  I remember when I heard about somebody trying to kill the treaty oak with a nerve agent,
[36:04.480 --> 36:10.280]  it was a Crowley guy, a big giant oak tree downtown Austin, he was able to kill it, middle
[36:10.280 --> 36:14.280]  of the night, basically jack hammered into it, dumped 100 pounds of weed killer on it,
[36:14.280 --> 36:18.320]  what a nice person, as soon as I heard that, I said that's a devil worshipper, came out
[36:18.320 --> 36:19.720]  two weeks later, it was a ritual.
[36:19.720 --> 36:24.760]  I'm just giving you the MO, surprise, surprise, a philosophy professor is trying to burn a
[36:24.760 --> 36:31.760]  church town, allegedly.
[36:31.760 --> 36:34.160]  Hell he's in New York City, they'll probably give him a medal, de Blasio, they'll probably
[36:34.160 --> 36:39.600]  give him a medal, like Smollett, he'd probably burn it down and blame it on a Christian,
[36:39.600 --> 36:40.600]  who knows.
[36:40.600 --> 36:41.600]  What a freakazoid.
[36:41.600 --> 36:46.120]  That's who's teaching your kids, that's who's inside the Justice Department, bunch of freaks
[36:46.120 --> 36:48.000]  like that guy.
[36:48.000 --> 36:52.000]  That's enough of that, let's give the press conference, like I said I would, total vindication
[36:52.000 --> 36:58.920]  of the President and the proof that the FBI leftist groups were funding the fake PP dossier,
[36:58.920 --> 37:03.320]  Buzzfeed, all of it, here it is.
[37:03.320 --> 37:08.040]  As you know, one of the primary purposes of the Special Counsel's investigation was to
[37:08.040 --> 37:14.360]  determine whether President Trump's campaign or any individual associated with it conspired
[37:14.360 --> 37:22.000]  or coordinated with the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.
[37:22.000 --> 37:28.120]  Volume 1 of the Special Counsel's report describes the results of that investigation.
[37:28.120 --> 37:33.400]  As you will see, the Special Counsel's report states that his, quote, investigation did
[37:33.400 --> 37:39.440]  not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian
[37:39.440 --> 37:44.360]  government in its election interference activities.
[37:44.360 --> 37:49.760]  I am sure that all Americans share my concern about the efforts of the Russian government
[37:49.760 --> 37:53.400]  to interfere in our presidential election.
[37:53.400 --> 37:59.240]  As the Special Counsel report makes clear, the Russian government sought to interfere
[37:59.240 --> 38:01.240]  in our election process.
[38:01.240 --> 38:08.480]  But as to the Special Counsel's thorough investigation, we now know that the Russian operatives who
[38:08.480 --> 38:14.240]  perpetrated these schemes did not have the cooperation of President Trump or the Trump
[38:14.240 --> 38:15.240]  campaign.
[38:15.240 --> 38:16.240]  A pause right there.
[38:16.240 --> 38:21.440]  It was actually found that 80% of the bots from companies hired in Russia who anybody
[38:21.440 --> 38:28.240]  can hire to promote their dog grooming place or your political candidate or your rock concert
[38:28.240 --> 38:30.120]  today, they'll spam.
[38:30.120 --> 38:34.000]  You can hire Russians to, you know, give you stolen emails, anything you want.
[38:34.000 --> 38:35.000]  Russia's big in that.
[38:35.000 --> 38:36.000]  So are other countries.
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.320]  80% of them were for Hillary.
[38:38.320 --> 38:39.320]  Surprise, surprise.
[38:39.320 --> 38:41.680]  She had 80% of the money in the campaign.
[38:41.680 --> 38:43.360]  And so they were spending money overseas big time.
[38:43.360 --> 38:45.880]  What do you think her foundation's for?
[38:45.880 --> 38:52.800]  So remember, Michael Moore attended a Russian sponsored bot farm protest of Trump once he
[38:52.800 --> 38:57.680]  was elected in 2017.
[38:57.680 --> 39:02.960]  Because the Democrats were getting their monies worth paying a company in Russia to send protesters
[39:02.960 --> 39:03.960]  out.
[39:03.960 --> 39:09.600]  It has nothing to do with the Russian government.
[39:09.600 --> 39:16.800]  Their proof to call me a Russian agent is 16 times on Jones's Facebook, someone posted
[39:16.800 --> 39:19.520]  in the comments something from a Russian bot.
[39:19.520 --> 39:22.160]  Oh my God, execute me.
[39:22.160 --> 39:26.640]  Got hundreds of millions of people posting stuff back then every year on my sites.
[39:26.640 --> 39:32.320]  And then 16 times a Russian bot said something trying to get followed.
[39:32.320 --> 39:37.600]  That's the most the total proof, but you pay Russians through the Piscate dossier in England.
[39:37.600 --> 39:40.400]  Millions and millions of dollars to sell lies to overthrow the election.
[39:40.400 --> 39:45.400]  And it's not election meddling.
[39:45.400 --> 39:48.280]  This is the proof of election meddling by the Democrats.
[39:48.280 --> 39:52.560]  And of course they used Russians that they paid off that are part of the Soros group
[39:52.560 --> 39:57.200]  that'll tell any lies they're told to, like Trump's in a hotel room, knowing all those
[39:57.200 --> 40:00.200]  hotel rooms are bugged, being pissed on by hookers.
[40:00.200 --> 40:07.120]  If he was that type of maniac, he'd ever gotten where he is.
[40:07.120 --> 40:11.080]  Unbelievable BS.
[40:11.080 --> 40:19.880]  16 times Russian bots posted on Jones's Facebook, yeah, in the comments.
[40:19.880 --> 40:23.800]  I'm surprised only 16 times, but again, send me to the gas chamber.
[40:23.800 --> 40:29.440]  Let's go back for the knowing assistance of any other American for that matter.
[40:29.440 --> 40:36.520]  That is something that all Americans can and should be grateful to have confirmed.
[40:36.520 --> 40:41.280]  The special counsel report outlines two main efforts by the Russian government to influence
[40:41.280 --> 40:44.800]  the 2016 election.
[40:44.800 --> 40:49.880]  Notice the report details efforts by the Internet Research Agency, a Russian company
[40:49.880 --> 40:56.120]  with close ties to the Russian government, to sow social discord among American voters
[40:56.120 --> 41:02.560]  through disinformation and social media operations, following a thorough investigation.
[41:02.560 --> 41:05.080]  It's linked up with RT.
[41:05.080 --> 41:06.320]  You go watch RT now.
[41:06.320 --> 41:11.480]  It's the most leftist stuff I've ever seen in my life, most of the time, unwatchable.
[41:11.480 --> 41:19.000]  That is supposedly the influencer with almost no viewers in the U.S., RT was okay like five
[41:19.000 --> 41:20.000]  years ago.
[41:20.000 --> 41:27.680]  RT is a joke in the United States, unwatchable crap.
[41:27.680 --> 41:29.080]  That influenced our election?
[41:29.080 --> 41:33.800]  That's the same thing, RT, Internet Research Agency, all that crap.
[41:33.800 --> 41:39.280]  You know what they're interested in on RT, an audience, an acceptance, and viewers.
[41:39.280 --> 41:40.280]  Let's continue.
[41:40.280 --> 41:41.280]  Pain.
[41:41.280 --> 41:46.680]  The special counsel brought charges in federal court against several Russian nationals and
[41:46.680 --> 41:51.160]  entities for their respective roles in this scheme.
[41:51.160 --> 41:55.920]  Those charges remain pending, and the individual defendants remain at large.
[41:55.920 --> 41:56.920]  Let's pause again.
[41:56.920 --> 42:01.240]  Yeah, they knew in guiding Russian military officials who probably aren't even involved,
[42:01.240 --> 42:04.240]  maybe, who knows, that they'll never show up.
[42:04.240 --> 42:07.120]  So that was another trick of Mueller knowing he didn't have anything.
[42:07.120 --> 42:10.560]  Well, let's just indict 13 Russian nationals that live in Russia.
[42:10.560 --> 42:11.640]  That'll really get something done.
[42:11.640 --> 42:12.640]  Let's continue.
[42:12.640 --> 42:18.560]  The special counsel found no evidence that any American, including anyone associated
[42:18.560 --> 42:25.280]  with the Trump campaign, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government or the IRA in
[42:25.280 --> 42:26.280]  this illegal scheme.
[42:26.280 --> 42:27.280]  I didn't pause.
[42:27.280 --> 42:31.560]  We're going to come back with the meat and potatoes where he says 100% Trump and involved
[42:31.560 --> 42:32.560]  with nothing.
[42:32.560 --> 42:33.560]  Let's back it up 20 seconds.
[42:33.560 --> 42:34.560]  Thanks.
[42:34.560 --> 42:36.600]  But here's the big takeaway from this.
[42:36.600 --> 42:39.880]  They tried to get thousands of Americans to take money.
[42:39.880 --> 42:42.880]  We're talking millions of dollars, in some cases, to sell out, and none of them would
[42:42.880 --> 42:43.880]  do it.
[42:43.880 --> 42:46.400]  Now, you know, they've been asking Democrats to sell out the country for money.
[42:46.400 --> 42:48.320]  They'd say, hell, I don't want money.
[42:48.320 --> 42:50.560]  I want to eff America.
[42:50.560 --> 42:51.560]  America was never great.
[42:51.560 --> 42:52.560]  It'll never be great.
[42:52.560 --> 42:55.320]  Their religion is hating this country.
[42:55.320 --> 42:56.640]  Democrats aren't Americans, folks.
[42:56.640 --> 42:57.640]  They aren't.
[42:57.640 --> 42:59.640]  They're enemies.

[44:09.240 --> 44:10.600]  The fish oil is better than it.
[44:10.600 --> 44:12.480]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.

[44:24.400 --> 44:25.400]  strong.

[44:28.240 --> 44:29.240]  burps.
[44:29.240 --> 44:31.580]  If you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[44:31.580 --> 44:33.080]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[44:33.080 --> 44:34.080]  It's so good.
[44:34.080 --> 44:35.080]  In my view.
[44:35.080 --> 44:36.080]  I'm not making a medical statement here.
[44:36.080 --> 44:37.080]  But let me tell you something.
[44:37.080 --> 44:39.680]  I eat five canthulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[44:39.680 --> 44:43.160]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.

[47:18.120 --> 47:36.440]  welcome back i'm alex jones your host well the molar report has come out totally vindicates
[47:36.440 --> 47:41.000]  that no american had direct contacts with the russians knowingly trying to manipulate
[47:41.000 --> 47:45.240]  the election that's true and that they basically went around trying to set everybody up but
[47:45.240 --> 47:50.920]  nobody would take the money or the bait really proud of my fellow americans ladies and gentlemen
[47:50.920 --> 47:57.520]  and i know that i had some of this happen to me and i'm not a liberty to get into it
[47:57.520 --> 48:04.280]  but i had to contact the fbi over multiple times okay and of course we all know what
[48:04.280 --> 48:10.280]  it goes back to but this is the reality of how big this was now do i feel sorry for myself
[48:10.280 --> 48:16.520]  being one of the main targets of this no am i pissed off yes i'm very pissed off they used
[48:16.520 --> 48:21.680]  this to take me off social media they used this to open criminal investigations they
[48:21.680 --> 48:28.600]  called me a russian agent under russia's control in congressional hearings in the house arm
[48:28.600 --> 48:33.000]  services committee very powerful committee in the senate intelligence committee in the
[48:33.000 --> 48:40.360]  house judiciary committee and many others imagine i mean mccarthy would ask people if they were
[48:40.360 --> 48:47.360]  russian agents and a lot of it turned out were they would just say that i'm a russian
[48:47.360 --> 48:51.040]  agent and that's how they started the whole ball rolling the thousands of news articles
[48:51.040 --> 48:58.680]  of demonization pieces and they want to just fade off into the sunset no it's despicable
[48:58.680 --> 49:03.680]  it's disgusting and what's even sicker is many of the democrats calling us russian agents
[49:03.680 --> 49:09.640]  were actually being paid off by the russians and others it's just disgusting but the big
[49:09.640 --> 49:15.480]  takeaway is if anything this is a whitewash sure it admits a lot of the crimes committed
[49:15.480 --> 49:22.000]  it admits that muller uh and you know his team was trying to set people up it admits
[49:22.000 --> 49:31.160]  that they sent just department money to democrat members of their families on the dossier crew
[49:31.160 --> 49:37.360]  so it's so many levels it's a criminal enterprise not just to defraud the taxpayers not just
[49:37.360 --> 49:42.560]  to defraud the voters not just to overthrow an election and have a coup but they made
[49:42.560 --> 49:46.320]  money out of it while they were at it and rozenstein is sitting there one of the main
[49:46.320 --> 49:52.560]  architects of the 25th amendment coup the whole time it's unbelievable so democrats
[49:52.560 --> 49:59.640]  whining and peeling saying this is a whitewash yeah to cover your butts cya let's go back
[49:59.640 --> 50:07.120]  to the press conference first the report details efforts by the internet research agency a
[50:07.120 --> 50:13.280]  russian company with close ties to the russian government to sow social discord among american
[50:13.280 --> 50:21.120]  voters through disinformation and social media operations following a thorough investigation
[50:21.120 --> 50:27.040]  of this disinformation campaign the special council brought charges in federal court against
[50:27.040 --> 50:33.360]  several russian nationals and entities for their respective roles in this scheme those
[50:33.360 --> 50:39.760]  charges remain pending and the individual defendants remain at large but the special
[50:39.760 --> 50:45.800]  council found no evidence that any american including anyone associated with the trump
[50:45.800 --> 50:52.640]  campaign conspired or coordinated with the russian government or the ira in this illegal
[50:52.640 --> 50:59.160]  scheme indeed as the report states quote the investigation did not identify evidence that
[50:59.160 --> 51:05.160]  any u.s. person knowingly or intentionally coordinated with the ira's interference operation
[51:05.160 --> 51:10.560]  unquote to pause but it's about to be a glitch here that was on the live feed so about this
[51:10.560 --> 51:15.320]  here triple exoneration but remember nobody knows this but just we need to get this word
[51:15.320 --> 51:23.640]  out it is election meddling to go hire russians with a british firm to make up stuff to bring
[51:23.640 --> 51:27.520]  out against trump during the election and then after that's the real election meddling
[51:27.520 --> 51:36.920]  with russians and it's all even in their whitewash continue council found no collusion by any
[51:36.920 --> 51:45.880]  americans in ira's illegal activities second the report details efforts by the russian
[51:45.880 --> 51:51.800]  military officials associated with the gru the russian military intelligence organization
[51:51.800 --> 51:59.040]  to hack into computers and steal documents and emails from individuals associated with
[51:59.040 --> 52:04.960]  the democratic party and hillary clinton's campaign for the purpose of eventual eventually
[52:04.960 --> 52:15.600]  publicizing these documents obtaining such unauthorized following a thorough investigation
[52:15.600 --> 52:22.400]  of these hacking operations the special counsel brought charge court role russian military
[52:22.400 --> 52:29.160]  officers for their respective roles in these illegal hacking operations those charges are
[52:29.160 --> 52:35.120]  still pending and the defendants remain at large but again the special counsel's report
[52:35.120 --> 52:40.600]  did not find any evidence that members of the trump campaign or anyone associated with
[52:40.600 --> 52:47.400]  the campaign conspired or coordinated with the russian government in these hacking operations
[52:47.400 --> 52:53.280]  in other words there was no evidence of the trump campaign collusion with the russian
[52:53.280 --> 52:59.960]  government's hacking the special counsel's investigation also examined russian efforts
[52:59.960 --> 53:08.160]  to publish stolen emails and documents on the internet the special counsel found that
[53:08.160 --> 53:14.560]  after the gru disseminated some of the stolen documents to entities that it controlled dc
[53:14.560 --> 53:21.120]  leaks and goose for two the gru transferred some of the stolen materials to wiki leaks
[53:21.120 --> 53:28.360]  for publication wiki leaks then made a series of document dumps the special counsel also
[53:28.360 --> 53:35.880]  investigated whether any member or affiliate of the trump campaign encouraged or otherwise
[53:35.880 --> 53:40.200]  played a role in these dissemination efforts stop right there and of course they say he
[53:40.200 --> 53:46.400]  doesn't so that's the triple kit so this isn't just a whitewash the democrats crimes there
[53:46.400 --> 53:50.200]  are some bombshells in there admitting what we already knew that they pay with the fake
[53:50.200 --> 53:55.120]  dossier with the russians but where's the beef we will see with the asans prosecution
[53:55.120 --> 54:00.600]  coming up where's the proof that asans got the stuff from the russians because we know
[54:00.600 --> 54:05.640]  it came people like snowden in the past and others and bradley manning not the russians
[54:05.640 --> 54:10.120]  and the download speeds have been looked at forensically and they've confirmed that you
[54:10.120 --> 54:18.920]  you couldn't get this over the internet that fast it was gotten on thumb drives amazing
[54:18.920 --> 54:23.840]  so now it's the russians that did this how about the crimes hillary committed with the
[54:23.840 --> 54:28.440]  legal server and the money uranium one and all that none of that's being discussed see
[54:28.440 --> 54:33.040]  a whitewash if mewler was looking for evidence of russian collusion he would have found it
[54:33.040 --> 54:38.160]  in the clinton's we've been looking for the report haven't found it yet don't think i
[54:38.160 --> 54:47.520]  should hold my breath let's continue with more of bar their applicable law publication
[54:47.520 --> 54:54.360]  of these types of material would not be criminal unless the publisher also participated in
[54:54.360 --> 55:01.000]  the underlying hacking conspiracy here to the special counsel's report did not find
[55:01.000 --> 55:07.080]  that any person associated with the trump campaign illegally participated in the dissemination
[55:07.080 --> 55:13.920]  of the materials finally the special counsel investigated a number of links or contacts
[55:13.920 --> 55:19.960]  between the trump campaign officials and individuals connected with the russian government during
[55:19.960 --> 55:26.600]  the two thousand sixteen presidential campaign after reviewing these contacts the special
[55:26.600 --> 55:34.080]  counsel did not find any conspiracy to violate us law involving russian linked persons and
[55:34.080 --> 55:41.080]  any persons associated with the trump campaign so that's the bottom line after nearly two
[55:41.080 --> 55:47.240]  years of investigation thousands of subpoenas hundreds of warrants and witness interviews
[55:47.240 --> 55:54.120]  the special counsel confirmed that the russian government sponsored efforts to illegally interfere
[55:54.120 --> 56:00.360]  with the two thousand sixteen presidential election but did not find that the trump campaign
[56:00.360 --> 56:07.000]  or other americans colluded in those efforts after finding no underlying collusion with
[56:07.000 --> 56:13.560]  russia the special counsel's report goes on to consider whether certain actions of the
[56:13.560 --> 56:08.440]  president could amount to obstruction of the special
[56:08.440 --> 56:14.360]  the special counsel's report goes on to consider whether certain actions of the president could
[56:14.360 --> 56:18.880]  amount to obstruction of the special counsel will come back with that they say of course
[56:18.880 --> 56:24.040]  not the president going this is ridiculous this investigation is crap i'm not working

[1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:37.080]  we've got about 10 minutes left on this press conference where trump is completely exonerated
[1:00:37.080 --> 1:00:44.560]  but there's a poisoned lining to this so-called silver cloud that we'll be discussing at
[1:00:44.560 --> 1:00:52.600]  the end of the next segment all reports out but first now turning general bar cleaning
[1:00:52.600 --> 1:01:00.120]  up for the obama deep state stay behind network that got caught trying to overturn an election
[1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:08.760]  working with actual russians that are run by for us to do it and mr. steel he now moves
[1:01:08.760 --> 1:01:13.800]  into the area of obstruction that's when the president says i'm innocent none of us took
[1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:18.400]  money from russia this is a bunch of crap he would reportedly cuss at people which is
[1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:22.920]  what you do when you're being accused of being a foreign agent when you're mr. red white
[1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:30.280]  and blue you get pissed off that's what happens i'm sorry it's never accuses you being a trader
[1:01:30.280 --> 1:01:34.480]  see how it feels see a democrat would love that because they hate america the average
[1:01:34.480 --> 1:01:38.520]  democrat would be like yeah of course i hate america that's that's cool those of us that
[1:01:38.520 --> 1:01:44.520]  care about the country are honorable it gets our blood temperature up here it is as i addressed
[1:01:44.520 --> 1:01:50.480]  in my march twenty fourth letter the special counsel did not make a traditional prosecutorial
[1:01:50.480 --> 1:01:56.800]  judgment regarding this allegation instead the report recounts ten episodes involving
[1:01:56.800 --> 1:02:02.240]  the president and discusses potential legal theories for connecting those activities to
[1:02:02.240 --> 1:02:08.440]  the elements of an obstruction offense after carefully reviewing the facts and legal theories
[1:02:08.440 --> 1:02:14.080]  outlined in the report and in consultation with the office of legal counsel and other
[1:02:14.080 --> 1:02:20.080]  department lawyers the deputy attorney general and i concluded that the evidence developed
[1:02:20.080 --> 1:02:25.120]  by the special counsel is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an
[1:02:25.120 --> 1:02:30.400]  obstruction of justice offense although the deputy attorney general and i disagreed with
[1:02:30.400 --> 1:02:35.360]  some of the special counsel's legal theories and felt that some of the episodes examined
[1:02:35.360 --> 1:02:41.160]  did not amount to obstruction as a matter of law we did not rely solely on that in making
[1:02:41.160 --> 1:02:46.680]  our decision instead we accepted the special counsel's legal framework for purposes of
[1:02:46.680 --> 1:02:52.440]  our analysis and evaluated the evidence as presented by the special counsel and reaching
[1:02:52.440 --> 1:02:58.560]  our conclusions in assessing the president's actions discussed in the report it is important
[1:02:58.560 --> 1:03:05.120]  to bear in mind the context president trump faced an unprecedented situation as he entered
[1:03:05.120 --> 1:03:10.840]  into office and sought to perform his responsibilities as president federal agents and prosecutors
[1:03:10.840 --> 1:03:18.160]  were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office to the conduct of some of it
[1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:22.600]  you've got democrats who say it's an insurance policy to make sure he doesn't get elected
[1:03:22.600 --> 1:03:27.440]  but if he does remove him creating a fraud paying their family members hundreds of thousands
[1:03:27.440 --> 1:03:34.280]  of dollars apiece to work in a special private group so that their criminal activity wouldn't
[1:03:34.280 --> 1:03:40.960]  be under for your power so it's a bunch of government officials and their wives and
[1:03:40.960 --> 1:03:45.280]  husbands set up a criminal group they pay taxpayer money to the criminal group to cook
[1:03:45.280 --> 1:03:52.080]  up a bunch of lies and then if the president gets upset and says that's a fraud he's obstructing
[1:03:52.080 --> 1:04:01.040]  justice you can't obstruct something when you're standing up against a pack of criminals
[1:04:01.040 --> 1:04:07.920]  and there's no crime when you've done nothing wrong when you know it's a sack of garbage
[1:04:07.920 --> 1:04:15.000]  you'd be insane not to say what in the world are you talking about let's continue it's
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:20.640]  at the same time there was relentless speculation in the news media about the president's personal
[1:04:20.640 --> 1:04:26.120]  culpability yet in the beginning back it up we're gonna come back from break with us
[1:04:26.120 --> 1:04:31.600]  there wasn't speculation russian scum they're all russians the russians are in control
[1:04:31.600 --> 1:04:40.400]  of our military we must remove him remember who said that teeth oberman remember who said
[1:04:40.400 --> 1:04:46.520]  we're gonna kill the president phil mud it's all the same group of knuckle dragging america
[1:04:46.520 --> 1:04:52.120]  hating trash john brennan joined the communist party in college and still is in it clapper
[1:04:52.120 --> 1:04:59.800]  all of them literally hate this country they're globalists our grandparents and great grandparents

[1:06:14.600 --> 1:06:36.200]  rallying patriots worldwide you're listening to the alex jones show well here's the president
[1:06:36.200 --> 1:06:41.480]  the last two years saying no collusion no corruption a comp a compilation that he just
[1:06:41.480 --> 1:06:46.280]  tweeted out we posted it to news wars dot com then i've got big breaking news and more
[1:06:46.280 --> 1:06:52.080]  of the attorney general's press conference here it is i do have the right to fight back
[1:06:52.080 --> 1:06:57.400]  and i'm fighting back not for me i'm fighting back for the people of this country no collusion
[1:06:57.400 --> 1:07:03.040]  there was no collusion no collusion no collusion there is absolutely no collusion there's no
[1:07:03.040 --> 1:07:08.200]  collusion the fact is there is no collusion no collusion there's no collusion this is
[1:07:08.200 --> 1:07:14.560]  a investigation where many many millions of dollars has been spent and there's no collusion
[1:07:14.560 --> 1:07:20.920]  this is ace a win for this president who for now two years has essentially been screaming
[1:07:20.920 --> 1:07:28.240]  there was no russia collusion he is backed up by muller maybe every time he said no collusion
[1:07:28.240 --> 1:07:33.080]  but more than 231 times so far maybe every time he said no collusion he was telling the
[1:07:33.080 --> 1:07:40.800]  truth this was an illegal takedown that failed and hopefully somebody's gonna look at the
[1:07:40.800 --> 1:07:48.480]  other side now there's a huge story up on info wars dot com by kit daniels is also
[1:07:48.480 --> 1:07:55.080]  on news wars dot com trump never used executive privilege to redact from muller report bar
[1:07:55.080 --> 1:08:00.960]  says but the democrats and the fbi and the justice department they all wanted large parts
[1:08:00.960 --> 1:08:06.960]  redacted but in public the democrats are saying release the whole thing knowing that the whole
[1:08:06.960 --> 1:08:19.840]  thing shows the criminal activity they were engaged in demanding demanding that all of
[1:08:19.840 --> 1:08:28.160]  this federal money be transferred over to groups to cook up all these lies about trump
[1:08:28.160 --> 1:08:35.400]  and now they've been demanding it all be relieved when it'll bring them down here's a clip
[1:08:35.400 --> 1:08:40.600]  consistent with longstanding executive branch practice the decision whether to assert executive
[1:08:40.600 --> 1:08:46.760]  privilege over any portion of the report rested with the president of the united states because
[1:08:46.760 --> 1:08:51.880]  the white house had voluntarily cooperated with the special counsel significant portions
[1:08:51.880 --> 1:08:58.480]  of the report contain material over which the president could have asserted privilege
[1:08:58.480 --> 1:09:04.200]  and he would have been well within his rights to do so following my march twenty ninth letter
[1:09:04.200 --> 1:09:10.200]  the office of the white house counsel requested the opportunity to review the redacted version
[1:09:10.200 --> 1:09:16.520]  of the report in order to advise the president on the potential invocation of privilege which
[1:09:16.520 --> 1:09:22.400]  is consistent with longstanding practice following that review the president confirmed that in
[1:09:22.400 --> 1:09:27.600]  the interest of transparency and full disclosure to the american people he would not assert
[1:09:27.600 --> 1:09:33.160]  privilege over the special counsel's report accordingly the public report i am releasing
[1:09:33.160 --> 1:09:39.560]  today contains redactions only for the four categories that i previously outlined and
[1:09:39.560 --> 1:09:46.040]  no material has been redacted based on executive privilege in addition earlier this week
[1:09:46.040 --> 1:09:52.040]  the president's personal counsel requested and was given the opportunity to read a final
[1:09:52.040 --> 1:09:58.520]  version of the redacted report before it was publicly released that request was consistent
[1:09:58.520 --> 1:10:02.880]  with the practice followed under the ethics and government act which permitted individuals
[1:10:02.880 --> 1:10:08.400]  named in a report prepared by an independent counsel the opportunity to read the report
[1:10:08.400 --> 1:10:13.680]  before publication the president's personal lawyers were not permitted to make and did
[1:10:13.680 --> 1:10:22.280]  not request any redactions so what's the takeaway from this
[1:10:22.280 --> 1:10:28.600]  the corporate media the establishment leftist media reported ninety six percent negative
[1:10:28.600 --> 1:10:36.120]  against the president one hundred percent negative against me a hundred percent negative
[1:10:36.120 --> 1:10:41.040]  against people like sean hannity the support of the president and laid out all this they
[1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:45.280]  tried to remove tucker carlson off air and all i'm saying the listeners is those of us
[1:10:45.280 --> 1:10:48.480]  that have told the truth throughout this that have represented the truth have been proven
[1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:55.080]  right and vindicated we're torn up pretty bad fox news is in a move to turn into a leftist
[1:10:55.080 --> 1:10:58.760]  group i can tell you from the highest levels that sean hannity's called in and chewed out
[1:10:58.760 --> 1:11:03.640]  and yelled at for defending the president i can tell you other people have been basically
[1:11:03.640 --> 1:11:07.560]  threatened with firing if they don't tell the line i can tell you laura ingram's hanging
[1:11:07.560 --> 1:11:16.360]  on by her fingernails and you see them stacking an audience pro bernie sanders at fox news
[1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:26.000]  for a fake town hall you see them hiring donna brazil who helped rig debates the democrats
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:31.600]  deals been made they're still planning to take trump out i just want listeners understand
[1:11:31.600 --> 1:11:39.720]  something your support and you spreading the word and all you've done is the reason this
[1:11:39.720 --> 1:11:44.200]  is happening but like the president just said that clip i'm not fighting for me only i'm
[1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:49.160]  fighting for you and why did trump tell you that he could have rolled over to them once
[1:11:49.160 --> 1:11:53.400]  he was president elect anytime and the power structure would have left him alone he hasn't
[1:11:53.400 --> 1:12:02.360]  done that and he's doing it for everybody and so am i but not because i'm a hero the
[1:12:02.360 --> 1:12:07.280]  globalists are evil they're anti human they're anti god they want to conquer this country
[1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:11.000]  they want to break up our families they're bad people you can't run a white flag up to
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:19.880]  those guys but you think about the corporate media the big takeaway here is they lied about
[1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:27.880]  trump said he couldn't win the election then they said he was a russian agent they got
[1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:33.320]  caught in that they've been caught in all these other things they did to judge cabinon
[1:12:33.320 --> 1:12:39.800]  now justice cabinon they create frauds it's what they do and i'm telling you you can't
[1:12:39.800 --> 1:12:47.120]  underestimate people like ron rozenstein roll some of the video behind me and just how disingenuous
[1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:54.480]  and criminal he is well he sits there like a possum that got caught in your backyard
[1:12:54.480 --> 1:12:59.160]  eating a big old pile of dog crap you walk outside at night and sitting over that pile
[1:12:59.160 --> 1:13:05.880]  of dog crap with it all over its face i mean that is a piece of garbage right there and
[1:13:05.880 --> 1:13:10.040]  he's been caught he lied to congress and said he wasn't part of the coup then it turns out
[1:13:10.040 --> 1:13:14.600]  he was part of the twenty fifth amendment coup and it was a serious coup and now you've
[1:13:14.600 --> 1:13:18.960]  got brennan and clapper and all the usual suspects saying well okay we did spy but under
[1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:28.480]  orders from the president we have executive privilege why are those guys walking around
[1:13:28.480 --> 1:13:35.640]  they personally try to destroy my life and so many other peoples and they're all anti-american
[1:13:35.640 --> 1:13:44.320]  filth that have covered up for the real sellout of this country globalist equals trader globalist
[1:13:44.320 --> 1:13:54.360]  equals collusion globalism equals the death of your country and the fact that we think
[1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:58.760]  it's a win that we've proven this is a fraud and we've proven that they created a fake
[1:13:58.760 --> 1:14:04.040]  dossier with taxpayer money yeah it's a win but it's a loss if we don't push it all the
[1:14:04.040 --> 1:14:09.600]  way because these crazy people are on tv telling us america shouldn't exist american flags
[1:14:09.600 --> 1:14:17.480]  are bad our militaries bad that we suck that's what enemies do when they're in charge and
[1:14:17.480 --> 1:14:23.000]  are brainwashing you if the mainstream media had full control we'd be one giant reeducation
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:28.920]  camp but the good news is they got their own cult members attuned in for two years the
[1:14:28.920 --> 1:14:32.680]  ratings for mainstream media were down over 90% in the last 20 years they had a dead cat
[1:14:32.680 --> 1:14:39.280]  bounce they went up 10% so they were only about down 80% they call that a boom in ratings
[1:14:39.280 --> 1:14:44.960]  and now they're plunging down to about 5% of what they were so they've lost three quarters
[1:14:44.960 --> 1:14:52.160]  of the viewers they had even though they were down 80% they're done it's over if we make
[1:14:52.160 --> 1:14:57.560]  it be over and just put placards out on your house or on your car or whatever msm is the
[1:14:57.560 --> 1:15:02.040]  enemy democratic party is the enemy democrats that used to be the enemy there's still some
[1:15:02.040 --> 1:15:06.120]  democrats that are good people that are just brainwashed but the lockstep democrat from
[1:15:06.120 --> 1:15:13.240]  mid level to the top are a globalist cult sworn to conquer the nation because if they
[1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:18.640]  conquer the country that has the technology and has the weapons they want global domination
[1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:24.800]  as hitler said today germany tomorrow the world well listen you bug-eyed control freak

[1:20:25.320 --> 1:20:38.360]  all right let me put a book in um on the big win for the globalist the big win for the left
[1:20:38.360 --> 1:20:42.920]  the big win for the deep state yes they lost the battle for their attempt to overthrow the election
[1:20:43.480 --> 1:20:49.880]  and their attempt to remove president trump but they won something very important to the
[1:20:49.880 --> 1:20:55.720]  larger global government system with this whole giant fraud and unless this fraud
[1:20:57.720 --> 1:21:05.000]  unwinds their activities and brings them down then it's a pyrrhic victory that means we've we've
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:10.360]  we've won this war but at a great expense that ends up destroying those of us of the good guys
[1:21:11.240 --> 1:21:15.720]  in the end i'm going to get to that here in just a moment also next segment you know
[1:21:15.720 --> 1:21:21.000]  that when i hear about russia collusion i want to jump off a cliff not literally i never will
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:25.400]  commit suicide if they say i'd commit suicide it's a lie i mean figuratively we're all sick of
[1:21:25.400 --> 1:21:30.600]  russia collusion we know it's not true but here at the end of it at least it's it's good to see
[1:21:30.600 --> 1:21:37.560]  mainstream media so discredited yet again and to have less than 10 percent of the viewers they had
[1:21:37.560 --> 1:21:44.920]  just a decade ago or so but next segment i'm going to get into something that gives me an even bigger
[1:21:44.920 --> 1:21:51.720]  headache and that's sandy hook i hardly ever talk about sandy hook i barely ever covered sandy hook
[1:21:52.760 --> 1:21:56.680]  hillary clinton as you know chose to make it part of her campaign about me and sandy hook
[1:21:56.680 --> 1:22:03.960]  so the left believes that i'm sandy hook man look it's sandy hook man i've got sh on my cape or
[1:22:03.960 --> 1:22:11.800]  something and i'm a villain but their attack pieces have gotten weirder and weirder and weirder
[1:22:11.800 --> 1:22:19.880]  and the new york times wrote a big one yesterday that i'm going to cover when we come back because
[1:22:19.880 --> 1:22:29.160]  it's very informative and then i happened to go find the video clips of where what i talk about
[1:22:29.160 --> 1:22:36.120]  was on the news and the lawyer is saying it wasn't and i kept noticing all these anomalies and things
[1:22:36.120 --> 1:22:40.840]  that were there they want me to say weren't there and i'm not even getting into whether sandy
[1:22:40.840 --> 1:22:46.520]  hook happened or not i think mass shootings happen it's that they won't let it go and they always say
[1:22:46.520 --> 1:22:52.600]  alex won't let it go but they're the ones that won't and now i've talked to locals in government
[1:22:52.600 --> 1:22:56.280]  you name it in canada can they explain to me that senator murphy and blumenthal especially
[1:22:56.280 --> 1:23:01.880]  murphy his whole career is off this blumenthal son runs the law firm suing me and it's like they're
[1:23:01.880 --> 1:23:06.760]  literally like they're the sandy hook vampires they feed off these poor dead kids so wait till
[1:23:06.760 --> 1:23:13.800]  i hit this next segment christ murphy says i must be taken off the air to save democracy
[1:23:13.800 --> 1:23:20.200]  because i won't stop attacking the families no it's you you bloodsucking arrogant little ghoul
[1:23:20.200 --> 1:23:25.400]  who i've now learned from locals ran on sandy hook and got into the u.s senate that's all you've got
[1:23:26.760 --> 1:23:32.840]  so now the shape of things is becoming very clear and lord works a mysterious way so
[1:23:32.840 --> 1:23:41.160]  so that's all coming up also somebody tried to burn down saint patrick's cathedral in new york
[1:23:41.160 --> 1:23:47.960]  city but it's barely in the news because he's a leftist professor i mean he had big cans of gas
[1:23:47.960 --> 1:23:52.840]  and lighters and they caught him with gasoline on the floor but i'm sure he's a nice person
[1:23:53.400 --> 1:23:57.960]  if he would have caught it on fire we'd be hearing from the mayor this is not arson this is not arson
[1:23:57.960 --> 1:24:05.880]  this is not arson that's up on info wars dot com we're going to be getting to all of that as well
[1:24:05.880 --> 1:24:10.840]  and and i do have a guest popping in i also want to open the phones up for not this next segment
[1:24:10.840 --> 1:24:16.280]  but the segment after and a little bit more we'll get avi on 15 after specifically on the muller
[1:24:16.280 --> 1:24:22.120]  report what your big takeaway is where you think all this is going i'm going to give you the
[1:24:22.120 --> 1:24:26.680]  poison lining to the cloud though and why they've still had a victory here in just a moment but first
[1:24:26.680 --> 1:24:34.840]  off let me just tell listeners about something that is the very best product for your telomeres
[1:24:34.840 --> 1:24:40.840]  that's your dna for your mitochondrial dna that's the antioxidant that's next level the pqq the
[1:24:40.840 --> 1:24:47.720]  coq 10 the amount of it in here depending on the equation something like 40 boxes of the same chemical
[1:24:47.720 --> 1:24:56.440]  that's naturally occurring in blueberries it's ridiculous the coq 10 the ppq we have the organically
[1:24:56.440 --> 1:25:00.760]  derived and by that it's not synthetic most of the stuff that you see on the shelves a tiny
[1:25:00.760 --> 1:25:05.560]  model of pqq or coq 10 it'll be like 50 bucks because even the synthetic is expensive this is
[1:25:05.560 --> 1:25:11.240]  the organically derived i still want to be clear it's it's it's not organic there's no such thing
[1:25:11.240 --> 1:25:16.520]  as it being organic unless you eat 40 boxes of blueberries it's genetically engineered bacteria
[1:25:16.520 --> 1:25:23.080]  created but the point is is that is that this is the real stuff um i want to warn you though
[1:25:23.080 --> 1:25:28.600]  now first we're taking it five years ago and this is dna force plus it's even stronger so we
[1:25:28.600 --> 1:25:35.800]  upgraded it you have to say plus when i cut my finger off like 15 years ago it they reattached it
[1:25:36.520 --> 1:25:42.600]  document cam shot please i'll show folks they they reattached the finger and you can see that right
[1:25:42.600 --> 1:25:47.880]  there were cut off they it was hanging about pieces of skin around here doesn't cut cleanly like you
[1:25:47.880 --> 1:25:53.320]  see in the movies it's going to pour it off uh it was numb all the way up here and the strangest
[1:25:53.320 --> 1:26:00.200]  thing is i started taking dna force and about two months my back where i was numb from a football
[1:26:00.200 --> 1:26:05.720]  injury hurt real bad because the nerve grew back and then the feeling came back in my finger first
[1:26:05.720 --> 1:26:11.720]  it tangled and it came back i was like this is incredible but i'm going to warn you most people
[1:26:11.720 --> 1:26:17.480]  that have old injuries and where nerves have kind of died out this isn't just regenerating your cells
[1:26:18.280 --> 1:26:22.520]  this is just slowing the shrinkage of telomeres which is the same thing is making them last longer
[1:26:23.960 --> 1:26:30.360]  it it really does regenerate nerves in many areas so it's the building blocks and so you
[1:26:30.360 --> 1:26:35.960]  read about wire billionaires starving themselves it's because it also studies show not eating a
[1:26:35.960 --> 1:26:40.440]  lot obviously makes you live longer trees that barely get enough water or whatever they live longer
[1:26:40.440 --> 1:26:44.920]  that's known so that's but they're also obsessed with pqq and coq 10 the japanese are what discovered
[1:26:44.920 --> 1:26:49.640]  all this and it's the next level it's the best you're going to get i remember saying what's the
[1:26:49.640 --> 1:26:54.520]  top selling thing like six years ago we're getting into supplements uh i guess seven years ago now
[1:26:54.520 --> 1:27:00.280]  and well it's pqq and coq 10 but mainly people at grocery stores don't want to pay that so they buy
[1:27:00.280 --> 1:27:04.760]  synthetic stuff that's still 50 60 bucks for a little bottle but at medical clinics it's not
[1:27:04.760 --> 1:27:09.560]  prescription but people are willing to pay you know 300 400 bucks and it's a six seven times
[1:27:09.560 --> 1:27:18.120]  markup we mark it up 150 percent then we discount it 20 30 percent down to 119 dollars
[1:27:18.120 --> 1:27:24.600]  they're still again most the cost is the product it's 20 percent off the the profit we make funds

[1:33:56.520 --> 1:34:00.520]  We shall go on playing
[1:34:00.520 --> 1:34:03.520]  On a farm
[1:34:03.520 --> 1:34:06.520]  On a town
[1:34:06.520 --> 1:34:10.520]  It's all over
[1:34:10.520 --> 1:34:14.520]  For the Russian collusion hoax
[1:34:14.520 --> 1:34:16.520]  It's all over
[1:34:16.520 --> 1:34:18.520]  For Hillary

[1:34:24.520 --> 1:34:26.520]  Strangely
[1:34:26.520 --> 1:34:28.520]  Strangely
[1:34:28.520 --> 1:34:30.520]  Strangely
[1:34:30.520 --> 1:34:34.520]  Let's get right to the meat and potatoes here
[1:34:34.520 --> 1:34:37.520]  I'll open the phones up next segment into the next hour
[1:34:37.520 --> 1:34:41.520]  And we have a special guest joining us, but I want your specific comments on the Mueller investigation
[1:34:41.520 --> 1:34:45.520]  And I'll give you that little star of the next segment, that little poison lining of the cloud
[1:34:45.520 --> 1:34:47.520]  From my view, but I want to get your view
[1:34:47.520 --> 1:34:50.520]  As well, the toll-free number to join us is 877-789 Alex
[1:34:50.520 --> 1:34:53.520]  877-789-2539
[1:34:53.520 --> 1:34:56.520]  Let's do first-time callers, give them a chance to get on first
[1:34:56.520 --> 1:35:00.520]  877-789-2539
[1:35:00.520 --> 1:35:02.520]  But right now, let's get to this
[1:35:02.520 --> 1:35:07.520]  There are so many New York Times articles, routinely on the front page of the paper
[1:35:07.520 --> 1:35:09.520]  Or on the front page of the website
[1:35:09.520 --> 1:35:12.520]  That I don't even read most of them
[1:35:12.520 --> 1:35:16.520]  Because you read them and it's like, painful
[1:35:16.520 --> 1:35:20.520]  Not that they're attacking me, but that they're such liars
[1:35:20.520 --> 1:35:24.520]  I mean, you know they're lying, but man, when you know the truth
[1:35:24.520 --> 1:35:26.520]  And it's about you
[1:35:26.520 --> 1:35:30.520]  And the stuff they're saying is just so in left field
[1:35:30.520 --> 1:35:33.520]  It's crazy, but sometimes they tell the truth
[1:35:33.520 --> 1:35:36.520]  And I was told by a New York Times writer
[1:35:36.520 --> 1:35:38.520]  About a year and a half ago
[1:35:38.520 --> 1:35:41.520]  They said, you need to basically come in and join us
[1:35:41.520 --> 1:35:43.520]  And turn against Trump, you're going to be destroyed
[1:35:43.520 --> 1:35:47.520]  This is an off-record conversation, meaning I can't say who told me this
[1:35:47.520 --> 1:35:49.520]  But they said, you're the low-hanging fruit
[1:35:49.520 --> 1:35:52.520]  They can't get Trump, so they want to get you
[1:35:52.520 --> 1:35:54.520]  And they think you're the populace that got him elected
[1:35:54.520 --> 1:35:56.520]  So they can destroy you, they destroy his base
[1:35:56.520 --> 1:36:00.520]  And I go, you mean you attack me, I turn against him
[1:36:00.520 --> 1:36:02.520]  And my base turns against him
[1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:04.520]  And I said, there's one way I'll turn against Trump
[1:36:04.520 --> 1:36:07.520]  And that's if he turns against the Republic
[1:36:07.520 --> 1:36:10.520]  You can put a gun to my head
[1:36:10.520 --> 1:36:17.520]  And I told that son of a bitch, don't you ever call me again
[1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:21.520]  And I've known that piece of crap a long time
[1:36:21.520 --> 1:36:25.520]  Like, you think you're going to threaten me
[1:36:25.520 --> 1:36:27.520]  And that I'm going to roll over?
[1:36:27.520 --> 1:36:29.520]  Not happening
[1:36:29.520 --> 1:36:31.520]  It's like I told Politico, you can look it up
[1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:33.520]  After Rand Paul got elected
[1:36:33.520 --> 1:36:35.520]  Four years ago, five years ago
[1:36:35.520 --> 1:36:38.520]  They were like, oh my gosh, Rand Paul is incredible, blah, blah
[1:36:38.520 --> 1:36:40.520]  They said, you know, we did all this stuff to him, we still won
[1:36:40.520 --> 1:36:44.520]  And I said, the only way you can defeat Rand Paul
[1:36:44.520 --> 1:36:46.520]  Is for the Politico to endorse him
[1:36:46.520 --> 1:36:48.520]  But see, it's the one thing they can't do
[1:36:48.520 --> 1:36:51.520]  You're hated in mainstream media
[1:36:51.520 --> 1:36:53.520]  But as I've pointed out
[1:36:53.520 --> 1:36:56.520]  From experience, but also from that source
[1:36:56.520 --> 1:37:01.520]  They literally believe their mythology
[1:37:01.520 --> 1:37:05.520]  That I'm like Godzilla attacking Tokyo
[1:37:05.520 --> 1:37:07.520]  And that if they can beat me
[1:37:07.520 --> 1:37:09.520]  They can beat Trump and beat America
[1:37:09.520 --> 1:37:11.520]  Remember, how much the left hates America
[1:37:11.520 --> 1:37:13.520]  How their ethos is, we're globalists
[1:37:13.520 --> 1:37:15.520]  We will conquer America
[1:37:15.520 --> 1:37:17.520]  It's the chicken, you know what, dimension
[1:37:17.520 --> 1:37:20.520]  The chicken SH-T dimension
[1:37:20.520 --> 1:37:22.520]  So I'm not going to read the whole LinkedIn New York Times article
[1:37:22.520 --> 1:37:25.520]  But I actually read this yesterday
[1:37:25.520 --> 1:37:26.520]  When I got off here
[1:37:26.520 --> 1:37:28.520]  It had been out for a day or so
[1:37:28.520 --> 1:37:31.520]  So maybe it's out for two days
[1:37:31.520 --> 1:37:34.520]  And they put it, they took a clip from a three-hour
[1:37:34.520 --> 1:37:37.520]  40-minute deposition I did a few months ago
[1:37:37.520 --> 1:37:42.520]  With Democrat lawyers here in Texas on Sandy Hook
[1:37:42.520 --> 1:37:49.520]  And what they chose to attack me on
[1:37:49.520 --> 1:37:51.520]  I knew, happened
[1:37:51.520 --> 1:37:53.520]  And so most of what they would bring up
[1:37:53.520 --> 1:37:56.520]  Was like things that were real
[1:37:56.520 --> 1:37:59.520]  That we legitimately questioned
[1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:02.520]  And then, I mean, I guess they just thought
[1:38:02.520 --> 1:38:04.520]  That I would just go along with them
[1:38:04.520 --> 1:38:07.520]  But when you read the article, it says
[1:38:07.520 --> 1:38:10.520]  Alex is a consolation prize
[1:38:10.520 --> 1:38:12.520]  Mueller didn't say Trump was a Russian agent
[1:38:12.520 --> 1:38:13.520]  And Trump's winning
[1:38:13.520 --> 1:38:15.520]  And Trump's probably going to win the 2020 election
[1:38:15.520 --> 1:38:20.520]  But at least we're going to get to destroy Alex Jones
[1:38:20.520 --> 1:38:25.520]  What a group of weirdos
[1:38:25.520 --> 1:38:28.520]  I mean, knowing our enemies are that demented and crazed
[1:38:28.520 --> 1:38:30.520]  Makes me feel good
[1:38:30.520 --> 1:38:32.520]  Because even if they can tear me apart
[1:38:32.520 --> 1:38:33.520]  Which is their goal
[1:38:33.520 --> 1:38:37.520]  You're going to continue on the fight and I salute you
[1:38:37.520 --> 1:38:43.520]  But just look at it, read for yourself
[1:38:43.520 --> 1:38:46.520]  Five days after Attorney General William Barr
[1:38:46.520 --> 1:38:53.520]  Released his exception expectation deflating summary
[1:38:53.520 --> 1:38:55.520]  Of the investigation of Trump campaign suspected
[1:38:55.520 --> 1:38:57.520]  Russia connections
[1:38:57.520 --> 1:38:59.520]  A pair of videos appeared on YouTube
[1:38:59.520 --> 1:39:02.520]  Labeled Alex Jones, Sandy Hook deposition
[1:39:02.520 --> 1:39:04.520]  The hundreds of thousands of views
[1:39:04.520 --> 1:39:05.520]  Those videos have accumulated
[1:39:05.520 --> 1:39:10.520]  A test to their appeal as a hashtag resistance
[1:39:10.520 --> 1:39:12.520]  Consolation prize
[1:39:12.520 --> 1:39:15.520]  We've only had about 40 million of years last week
[1:39:15.520 --> 1:39:17.520]  We have 400,000 views, we're winning
[1:39:17.520 --> 1:39:22.520]  Maybe it's not a bitually lying president
[1:39:22.520 --> 1:39:25.520]  But at least someone is getting called to account
[1:39:25.520 --> 1:39:28.520]  Under oath for his role in post-truthification
[1:39:28.520 --> 1:39:31.520]  That's a great name for the New York Times
[1:39:31.520 --> 1:39:34.520]  Of American public life
[1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:36.520]  Jones, the Trump-endorse proprietor
[1:39:36.520 --> 1:39:40.520]  Of the conspiracy-mongering M4WARS media empire
[1:39:40.520 --> 1:39:43.520]  Is being sued for defamation by 10 families of children
[1:39:43.520 --> 1:39:46.520]  Who's murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School
[1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:48.520]  That mass shooting, seven years ago
[1:39:48.520 --> 1:39:50.520]  Maintained until recently, no, that's five years ago
[1:39:50.520 --> 1:39:53.520]  I said it happened, was a hoax perpetuated
[1:39:53.520 --> 1:39:55.520]  With the convenience of the victim's parents
[1:39:55.520 --> 1:39:56.520]  I never said that
[1:39:56.520 --> 1:39:59.520]  Many of whom have found themselves harassed
[1:39:59.520 --> 1:40:01.520]  And threatened, none by me, and hounded
[1:40:01.520 --> 1:40:04.520]  And it goes on to say it's a consolation prize
[1:40:04.520 --> 1:40:07.520]  To see Jones, even though we can't get Trump
[1:40:07.520 --> 1:40:09.520]  Control of consolation prize
[1:40:09.520 --> 1:40:10.520]  I won't have to read the whole thing again
[1:40:10.520 --> 1:40:12.520]  But it says it in here
[1:40:12.520 --> 1:40:14.520]  So that's all this is, is I'm like this
[1:40:14.520 --> 1:40:17.520]  Symbolic simulation of victory
[1:40:17.520 --> 1:40:20.520]  For the horrible miscreant left
[1:40:20.520 --> 1:40:22.520]  With one of their people just caught
[1:40:22.520 --> 1:40:24.520]  Trying to fire bomb
[1:40:24.520 --> 1:40:27.520]  St. Patrick Cathedral in New York yesterday
[1:40:27.520 --> 1:40:30.520]  I mean, they're so mad they don't control reality anymore
[1:40:30.520 --> 1:40:32.520]  They don't know what to do
[1:40:32.520 --> 1:40:34.520]  So let's just move on here
[1:40:34.520 --> 1:40:36.520]  They then say
[1:40:36.520 --> 1:40:38.520]  Look at this incredible three-minute clip
[1:40:38.520 --> 1:40:41.520]  That will play after the break
[1:40:41.520 --> 1:40:42.520]  And go to your calls
[1:40:42.520 --> 1:40:45.520]  Look at this incredible clip
[1:40:45.520 --> 1:40:48.520]  Jones has pinned down how he made up
[1:40:48.520 --> 1:40:50.520]  That the news said there was a man in camo
[1:40:50.520 --> 1:40:51.520]  And black that got arrested
[1:40:51.520 --> 1:40:54.520]  Or that there was a drill nearby
[1:40:54.520 --> 1:40:56.520]  And I keep telling banks to know
[1:40:56.520 --> 1:40:58.520]  I've seen that video, their lawyer
[1:40:58.520 --> 1:41:00.520]  And in 30 seconds you can search and pull it up
[1:41:00.520 --> 1:41:02.520]  We'll show it all till we come back
[1:41:02.520 --> 1:41:04.520]  We're not saying it doesn't mean the shooting didn't happen
[1:41:04.520 --> 1:41:07.520]  The point is they want me to say the sky isn't blue
[1:41:07.520 --> 1:41:09.520]  And then they use as their big proof
[1:41:09.520 --> 1:41:11.520]  I mean, how do you even describe this?
[1:41:11.520 --> 1:41:13.520]  The New York Times claims that there weren't reports
[1:41:13.520 --> 1:41:15.520]  Of two shooters or a man arrested in camo
[1:41:15.520 --> 1:41:19.520]  I'm going to show you him being arrested
[1:41:19.520 --> 1:41:22.520]  Think of the boldness of that
[1:41:22.520 --> 1:41:24.520]  How they think they're part of the establishment
[1:41:24.520 --> 1:41:27.520]  How the media thinks it can just lie about something
[1:41:27.520 --> 1:41:30.520]  That's on dozens of newscasts
[1:41:30.520 --> 1:41:32.520]  We'll play those newscasts
[1:41:32.520 --> 1:41:34.520]  Let me come back and finish up on this and move on
[1:41:34.520 --> 1:41:37.520]  And show you local news reporting reports of second gunmen
[1:41:37.520 --> 1:41:39.520]  Parents intimidated by other shooters
[1:41:39.520 --> 1:41:41.520]  They thought might exist
[1:41:41.520 --> 1:41:43.520]  I mean, that's why people questioned this
[1:41:43.520 --> 1:41:45.520]  Which is totally reasonable in the age of media
[1:41:45.520 --> 1:41:48.520]  Lying in so many hoaxes
[1:41:48.520 --> 1:41:50.520]  But see, they took it as weakness four or five years ago
[1:41:50.520 --> 1:41:52.520]  And I said, I'm sick of the debate
[1:41:52.520 --> 1:41:54.520]  Mass shootings happen, I believe Sandy Hook happened
[1:41:54.520 --> 1:41:56.520]  They went, oh my god
[1:41:56.520 --> 1:41:58.520]  He's weak now for some reason
[1:41:58.520 --> 1:42:00.520]  Let's now make him the Sandy Hook man
[1:42:00.520 --> 1:42:02.520]  No, I said that because I think the kids died
[1:42:02.520 --> 1:42:04.520]  Now I have a right to question if I want
[1:42:04.520 --> 1:42:06.520]  But now as we get deeper into this
[1:42:06.520 --> 1:42:09.520]  What becomes the discovery of the politicos
[1:42:09.520 --> 1:42:12.520]  Senator Murphy and Blumenthal have made it their whole career
[1:42:12.520 --> 1:42:14.520]  They're the Sandy Hook vampires
[1:42:14.520 --> 1:42:16.520]  It's their whole life, they live off this
[1:42:16.520 --> 1:42:18.520]  And that's what really happened
[1:42:18.520 --> 1:42:20.520]  And the cover-up of the slow police response
[1:42:20.520 --> 1:42:22.520]  And I'm not attacking the police and all the rest of it
[1:42:22.520 --> 1:42:25.520]  And then the lawyer suing the hero teacher
[1:42:25.520 --> 1:42:27.520]  That tried to save the children
[1:42:27.520 --> 1:42:30.520]  And suing the police and suing the town
[1:42:30.520 --> 1:42:32.520]  They're the vampires, the lawyers
[1:42:32.520 --> 1:42:34.520]  They're the Sandy Hook vampires
[1:42:34.520 --> 1:42:36.520]  They'll be exposing all this
[1:42:36.520 --> 1:42:38.520]  They've stuck their hand in a bear trap
[1:42:38.520 --> 1:42:40.520]  And the Lord works in mysterious ways
[1:42:40.520 --> 1:42:42.520]  So just keep those prayers coming, listeners
[1:42:42.520 --> 1:42:44.520]  And keep the financial support coming
[1:42:44.520 --> 1:42:46.520]  And you've got a commitment that I will damn the torpedoes

[1:45:30.520 --> 1:45:32.520]  And the longer the people know the truth

[1:45:37.520 --> 1:45:39.520]  And go through the fire for it
[1:45:39.520 --> 1:45:41.520]  There is a magic that then takes place
[1:45:41.520 --> 1:45:43.520]  That transcends space and time
[1:45:43.520 --> 1:45:45.520]  When you commit, be a word of mouth
[1:45:45.520 --> 1:45:46.520]  Or to pray for us
[1:45:46.520 --> 1:45:47.520]  Or to spread our articles and videos
[1:45:47.520 --> 1:45:50.520]  That overrides everything the enemy's doing

[1:45:53.520 --> 1:45:54.520]  However you can

[1:45:56.520 --> 1:45:58.520]  Is your own provision
[1:45:58.520 --> 1:46:00.520]  I want to say Brain Force is great
[1:46:00.520 --> 1:46:02.520]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing
[1:46:02.520 --> 1:46:03.520]  It is
[1:46:03.520 --> 1:46:05.520]  But if you took it with fish oil
[1:46:05.520 --> 1:46:07.520]  It's like the fish oil is it
[1:46:07.520 --> 1:46:09.520]  The fish oil is better than it
[1:46:09.520 --> 1:46:11.520]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about
[1:46:11.520 --> 1:46:13.520]  Fish oil is liquid energy
[1:46:13.520 --> 1:46:15.520]  Brain, body, heart
[1:46:15.520 --> 1:46:16.520]  The cleanest, the best out there
[1:46:16.520 --> 1:46:18.520]  You've got the children's
[1:46:18.520 --> 1:46:19.520]  You've got the adults
[1:46:19.520 --> 1:46:20.520]  You've got the krill oil
[1:46:20.520 --> 1:46:21.520]  If you're going to get the full effect
[1:46:21.520 --> 1:46:22.520]  The fish oil
[1:46:22.520 --> 1:46:23.520]  And the children's are really strong
[1:46:23.520 --> 1:46:24.520]  They don't give you the burpees
[1:46:24.520 --> 1:46:26.520]  But krill oil is the best
[1:46:26.520 --> 1:46:27.520]  And it'll give you the damn burps
[1:46:27.520 --> 1:46:28.520]  And I'm just sorry
[1:46:28.520 --> 1:46:29.520]  You want something like this
[1:46:29.520 --> 1:46:30.520]  You don't get stuff for free
[1:46:30.520 --> 1:46:32.520]  The krill is hallucinogenic
[1:46:32.520 --> 1:46:33.520]  It's so good
[1:46:33.520 --> 1:46:34.520]  In my view
[1:46:34.520 --> 1:46:35.520]  I'm not a medical statement here
[1:46:35.520 --> 1:46:36.520]  But let me tell you something
[1:46:36.520 --> 1:46:38.520]  I eat five campelots of krill oil
[1:46:38.520 --> 1:46:39.520]  Before I go to bed
[1:46:39.520 --> 1:46:41.520]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night
[1:46:41.520 --> 1:46:44.520]  So your brain is made
[1:46:44.520 --> 1:46:47.520]  Basically out of what fish oil is
[1:46:47.520 --> 1:46:51.520]  So we don't make a big profit off of it
[1:46:51.520 --> 1:46:52.520]  But you notice I just obsess
[1:46:52.520 --> 1:46:54.520]  Because whatever the best is we've got
[1:46:54.520 --> 1:46:55.520]  I just can't lie to you
[1:46:55.520 --> 1:47:18.520]  I just can't do it
[1:47:18.520 --> 1:47:28.520]  From 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central
[1:47:28.520 --> 1:47:29.520]  We're here live
[1:47:29.520 --> 1:47:30.520]  It's the most banned broadcast in the world
[1:47:30.520 --> 1:47:31.520]  Thanks for joining us
[1:47:31.520 --> 1:47:32.520]  Please don't spread the word
[1:47:32.520 --> 1:47:33.520]  Because you're the only way we get out there
[1:47:33.520 --> 1:47:34.520]  I want to thank you again
[1:47:34.520 --> 1:47:35.520]  I'm Alex Jones, your host
[1:47:35.520 --> 1:47:36.520]  So I want to shift gears into your phone calls
[1:47:36.520 --> 1:47:37.520]  On the Mueller report
[1:47:37.520 --> 1:47:38.520]  And how big a devastating blow it is
[1:47:38.520 --> 1:47:39.520]  To the controlled Democrat press
[1:47:39.520 --> 1:47:40.520]  That they've been proven to be liars
[1:47:40.520 --> 1:47:41.520]  Yet again
[1:47:41.520 --> 1:47:42.520]  And it's really them
[1:47:42.520 --> 1:47:43.520]  In Russian collusion
[1:47:43.520 --> 1:47:44.520]  And they paid for a fake dossier
[1:47:44.520 --> 1:47:45.520]  And with taxpayer money
[1:47:45.520 --> 1:47:46.520]  We're going to get to all that
[1:47:46.520 --> 1:47:47.520]  In just a few minutes
[1:47:47.520 --> 1:47:48.520]  The first-time callers
[1:47:48.520 --> 1:47:49.520]  On this subject only
[1:47:49.520 --> 1:47:51.520]  877-789-Alex
[1:47:51.520 --> 1:47:55.520]  877-789-2539
[1:47:55.520 --> 1:47:56.520]  First-time callers, please
[1:47:56.520 --> 1:47:58.520]  Let's give new callers a chance
[1:47:58.520 --> 1:48:00.520]  877-789-2539
[1:48:00.520 --> 1:48:01.520]  Thank you
[1:48:01.520 --> 1:48:04.520]  So I'm reading The New York Times
[1:48:04.520 --> 1:48:06.520]  And it's the power they've got
[1:48:06.520 --> 1:48:08.520]  Like Democrats have to yell and scream
[1:48:08.520 --> 1:48:10.520]  And run a conservative out of a restaurant
[1:48:10.520 --> 1:48:11.520]  Or how they have the power
[1:48:11.520 --> 1:48:13.520]  To have CPS take your kids
[1:48:13.520 --> 1:48:14.520]  Or how they have the power
[1:48:14.520 --> 1:48:15.520]  To bring in illegal aliens
[1:48:15.520 --> 1:48:16.520]  To run your life
[1:48:16.520 --> 1:48:18.520]  Don't want them brought to their city
[1:48:18.520 --> 1:48:20.520]  And they talk about how incredible
[1:48:20.520 --> 1:48:21.520]  This lawyer is
[1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:24.520]  The new perimation
[1:48:24.520 --> 1:48:25.520]  I guess if you crossed Gollum
[1:48:25.520 --> 1:48:26.520]  With a lawyer
[1:48:26.520 --> 1:48:27.520]  You would get
[1:48:27.520 --> 1:48:30.520]  You would get Mark Bankston
[1:48:30.520 --> 1:48:31.520]  Chortling, giggling
[1:48:31.520 --> 1:48:33.520]  Rubbing his hands together
[1:48:33.520 --> 1:48:34.520]  Like a gremlin or something
[1:48:34.520 --> 1:48:35.520]  He kept going
[1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:36.520]  Oh, so you say
[1:48:36.520 --> 1:48:38.520]  Well, I'll play the clip
[1:48:38.520 --> 1:48:39.520]  So you say
[1:48:39.520 --> 1:48:41.520]  You saw a man in Swap
[1:48:41.520 --> 1:48:42.520]  You're in the woods
[1:48:42.520 --> 1:48:43.520]  And I'm like
[1:48:43.520 --> 1:48:45.520]  It's on a helicopter feed
[1:48:45.520 --> 1:48:47.520]  It's on the news
[1:48:47.520 --> 1:48:49.520]  They reported it in a bunch of newspapers
[1:48:49.520 --> 1:48:50.520]  He's like
[1:48:50.520 --> 1:48:51.520]  No, those are reporters
[1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:52.520]  And I'm like
[1:48:52.520 --> 1:48:53.520]  Well, reporters too
[1:48:53.520 --> 1:48:55.520]  But no, this was separate
[1:48:55.520 --> 1:48:56.520]  He's like
[1:48:56.520 --> 1:48:57.520]  No
[1:48:57.520 --> 1:48:59.520]  Well, see The New York Times knows
[1:48:59.520 --> 1:49:01.520]  You're not going to go look that up
[1:49:01.520 --> 1:49:03.520]  So we went and looked it up
[1:49:03.520 --> 1:49:04.520]  We've got newscasts
[1:49:04.520 --> 1:49:05.520]  For newscasts
[1:49:05.520 --> 1:49:06.520]  And even though it's low-rest footage
[1:49:06.520 --> 1:49:07.520]  We watched it live at the time
[1:49:07.520 --> 1:49:09.520]  You can see the man in camo
[1:49:09.520 --> 1:49:11.520]  And with a black shirt
[1:49:11.520 --> 1:49:12.520]  That the police arrested
[1:49:12.520 --> 1:49:14.520]  And eyewitnesses saying it
[1:49:14.520 --> 1:49:15.520]  And local news
[1:49:15.520 --> 1:49:16.520]  And then police later
[1:49:16.520 --> 1:49:18.520]  And prosecutors and others saying
[1:49:18.520 --> 1:49:20.520]  We're worried about second shooters
[1:49:20.520 --> 1:49:22.520]  Months later
[1:49:22.520 --> 1:49:24.520]  Targeting the families
[1:49:24.520 --> 1:49:26.520]  So, and as I said
[1:49:26.520 --> 1:49:27.520]  The net position
[1:49:27.520 --> 1:49:28.520]  Yeah, I think there still could be
[1:49:28.520 --> 1:49:30.520]  A second shooter at large
[1:49:30.520 --> 1:49:32.520]  There's something going on here
[1:49:32.520 --> 1:49:33.520]  It took them six years
[1:49:33.520 --> 1:49:35.520]  To put a report out on this
[1:49:35.520 --> 1:49:36.520]  It's not illegal to question things
[1:49:36.520 --> 1:49:38.520]  So there's something big
[1:49:38.520 --> 1:49:40.520]  In Sandy Hook
[1:49:40.520 --> 1:49:41.520]  So here they are in this article
[1:49:41.520 --> 1:49:42.520]  Saying Jones caught
[1:49:42.520 --> 1:49:44.520]  Making up man in the woods
[1:49:44.520 --> 1:49:46.520]  Well, here's a few of the newscast clips
[1:49:46.520 --> 1:49:48.520]  Then I'll show you a bunch of newspapers
[1:49:48.520 --> 1:49:50.520]  Here it is
[1:49:52.520 --> 1:49:54.520]  And go ahead and feed audio
[1:49:54.520 --> 1:49:56.520]  We've got helicopter audio
[1:49:58.520 --> 1:50:00.520]  Why would we
[1:50:00.520 --> 1:50:02.520]  Send video
[1:50:02.520 --> 1:50:04.520]  That has the helicopter audio
[1:50:04.520 --> 1:50:06.520]  I just
[1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:08.520]  Laugh me, I can't understand that
[1:50:08.520 --> 1:50:12.520]  But it doesn't really matter
[1:50:12.520 --> 1:50:14.520]  So again, if you're a radio
[1:50:14.520 --> 1:50:16.520]  Listener, you obviously can't hear this
[1:50:16.520 --> 1:50:18.520]  But this is the police
[1:50:18.520 --> 1:50:20.520]  And this is
[1:50:20.520 --> 1:50:22.520]  The footage
[1:50:22.520 --> 1:50:24.520]  Of the man in the woods
[1:50:24.520 --> 1:50:26.520]  In the camo
[1:50:26.520 --> 1:50:28.520]  And all the rest of it from the historical records vault
[1:50:28.520 --> 1:50:30.520]  And again, then they announced
[1:50:30.520 --> 1:50:32.520]  On the news that that is indeed
[1:50:32.520 --> 1:50:33.520]  What they've done
[1:50:33.520 --> 1:50:34.520]  There's not really much there to miss
[1:50:34.520 --> 1:50:36.520]  When you have the helicopter audio
[1:50:36.520 --> 1:50:38.520]  Of the
[1:50:38.520 --> 1:50:40.520]  Blade spinning and all the rest of it
[1:50:40.520 --> 1:50:42.520]  But it does show
[1:50:42.520 --> 1:50:44.520]  You're a radio listener, you obviously can't see this
[1:50:44.520 --> 1:50:46.520]  The police going to the woods
[1:50:46.520 --> 1:50:48.520]  And then they have the
[1:50:48.520 --> 1:50:50.520]  Local newscast talking about it with eyewitnesses
[1:50:50.520 --> 1:50:52.520]  And then I'll show you some of those
[1:50:52.520 --> 1:50:54.520]  Some of those news articles
[1:50:54.520 --> 1:50:56.520]  So let's go ahead
[1:50:56.520 --> 1:50:58.520]  I saw him walk a guy earlier
[1:50:58.520 --> 1:51:00.520]  With handcuffs, he walked by us and said he didn't do it
[1:51:00.520 --> 1:51:02.520]  It was a grown man
[1:51:02.520 --> 1:51:04.520]  He's sitting in the front of the police car over there now
[1:51:04.520 --> 1:51:06.520]  He didn't have a gun?
[1:51:06.520 --> 1:51:08.520]  No, I just had him handcuffed
[1:51:08.520 --> 1:51:10.520]  And he walked by us
[1:51:10.520 --> 1:51:12.520]  And looked into parent's eyes
[1:51:12.520 --> 1:51:14.520]  And said I didn't do it
[1:51:14.520 --> 1:51:16.520]  How was he dressed?
[1:51:16.520 --> 1:51:18.520]  Camo pants with a dark jacket
[1:51:18.520 --> 1:51:20.520]  And again
[1:51:20.520 --> 1:51:22.520]  We have another clip that I'm going to play
[1:51:22.520 --> 1:51:24.520]  Clip 3
[1:51:24.520 --> 1:51:26.520]  Two shooters, woods, witness
[1:51:26.520 --> 1:51:28.520]  News director
[1:51:28.520 --> 1:51:30.520]  Let's play clip 3 now
[1:51:30.520 --> 1:51:32.520]  Here it is
[1:51:32.520 --> 1:51:34.520]  I saw him walk a guy earlier
[1:51:34.520 --> 1:51:36.520]  With handcuffs
[1:51:36.520 --> 1:51:38.520]  He walked by us and said he didn't do it
[1:51:38.520 --> 1:51:40.520]  It was a grown man
[1:51:40.520 --> 1:51:42.520]  He's sitting in the front of the police car over there now
[1:51:42.520 --> 1:51:44.520]  He didn't have a gun?
[1:51:44.520 --> 1:51:46.520]  No, I just had him handcuffed
[1:51:46.520 --> 1:51:48.520]  And he walked by us and looked into parent's eyes
[1:51:48.520 --> 1:51:50.520]  And said I didn't do it
[1:51:50.520 --> 1:51:52.520]  How was he dressed?
[1:51:52.520 --> 1:51:54.520]  Camo pants with a dark jacket
[1:51:54.520 --> 1:51:56.520]  We have Mike Bellamy news director
[1:51:56.520 --> 1:51:58.520]  For WICC 600
[1:51:58.520 --> 1:52:00.520]  Mike, two shooters
[1:52:00.520 --> 1:52:02.520]  Yes, the latest information
[1:52:02.520 --> 1:52:04.520]  Is that two shooters
[1:52:04.520 --> 1:52:06.520]  We have unconfirmed reports that one of the shooters
[1:52:06.520 --> 1:52:08.520]  Is dead
[1:52:08.520 --> 1:52:10.520]  And there is another individual
[1:52:10.520 --> 1:52:12.520]  Who is being pulled out of a wooded area
[1:52:12.520 --> 1:52:14.520]  In handcuffs and being questioned by police
[1:52:14.520 --> 1:52:16.520]  As you guys have been reporting
[1:52:16.520 --> 1:52:18.520]  It happened in the 9 o'clock local time
[1:52:18.520 --> 1:52:20.520]  This morning, but the latest information
[1:52:20.520 --> 1:52:22.520]  Is unconfirmed reports
[1:52:22.520 --> 1:52:24.520]  Two shooters, one of the shooters dead
[1:52:24.520 --> 1:52:26.520]  And another shooter
[1:52:26.520 --> 1:52:28.520]  Possible shooter in handcuffs
[1:52:28.520 --> 1:52:30.520]  Out of a local wooded area
[1:52:32.520 --> 1:52:34.520]  And I could go on for hours here
[1:52:34.520 --> 1:52:36.520]  But you get the whole point
[1:52:38.520 --> 1:52:40.520]  You could play the clip over and over again
[1:52:40.520 --> 1:52:42.520]  Of the lawyer telling me
[1:52:42.520 --> 1:52:44.520]  There was no man in Camo
[1:52:44.520 --> 1:52:46.520]  With a dark top on
[1:52:46.520 --> 1:52:48.520]  There was no tactical gear
[1:52:48.520 --> 1:52:50.520]  You just made that up, didn't you, Mr. Jones?
[1:52:50.520 --> 1:52:52.520]  Even though I've got business insider
[1:52:52.520 --> 1:52:54.520]  Associated Press
[1:52:54.520 --> 1:52:56.520]  The local New Haven paper
[1:52:56.520 --> 1:52:58.520]  That became shot for TV viewers
[1:52:58.520 --> 1:53:00.520]  Police Union seeks funding
[1:53:00.520 --> 1:53:02.520]  For trauma treatment
[1:53:02.520 --> 1:53:04.520]  Archived today, this is out of the local
[1:53:04.520 --> 1:53:06.520]  New Town B
[1:53:06.520 --> 1:53:08.520]  And it says right here, a man with a gun
[1:53:08.520 --> 1:53:10.520]  Who was spotted in the woods
[1:53:10.520 --> 1:53:12.520]  Near the school on the day of the incident
[1:53:12.520 --> 1:53:14.520]  Was an off-duty tactical
[1:53:14.520 --> 1:53:16.520]  Squad police officer from other town
[1:53:16.520 --> 1:53:18.520]  According to sources
[1:53:20.520 --> 1:53:22.520]  Let me show you another article
[1:53:22.520 --> 1:53:24.520]  Want to get a shot of that right there?
[1:53:24.520 --> 1:53:26.520]  With the highlight? Thanks
[1:53:26.520 --> 1:53:28.520]  When I post this right there for folks
[1:53:28.520 --> 1:53:30.520]  This is what I'm going off of
[1:53:30.520 --> 1:53:32.520]  They're acting like I'm just making all this up
[1:53:32.520 --> 1:53:34.520]  Footage of police arresting second man in woods
[1:53:34.520 --> 1:53:36.520]  Right after the Sandy Hook shooting
[1:53:38.520 --> 1:53:40.520]  That's business insider, what are you going to sue them?
[1:53:42.520 --> 1:53:44.520]  Terror attacks and drills
[1:53:44.520 --> 1:53:46.520]  Coincidence or conspiracy
[1:53:46.520 --> 1:53:48.520]  This article gets into all the drills
[1:53:48.520 --> 1:53:50.520]  That were running that day
[1:53:50.520 --> 1:53:52.520]  And I've got more
[1:53:52.520 --> 1:53:54.520]  The DA sites potential suspects
[1:53:54.520 --> 1:53:56.520]  Fears, witness
[1:53:56.520 --> 1:53:58.520]  Safety
[1:53:58.520 --> 1:54:00.520]  So it says we got to keep everything secret
[1:54:00.520 --> 1:54:02.520]  This is months after it happened
[1:54:02.520 --> 1:54:04.520]  Because there might be another shooter
[1:54:04.520 --> 1:54:06.520]  That's three months later
[1:54:06.520 --> 1:54:08.520]  February of the next year
[1:54:10.520 --> 1:54:12.520]  So we're saying hey there may be more shooters
[1:54:12.520 --> 1:54:14.520]  Well the DA said that, how about you sue him?
[1:54:14.520 --> 1:54:16.520]  See what they don't want
[1:54:16.520 --> 1:54:18.520]  Is you look at the end of this
[1:54:18.520 --> 1:54:20.520]  And I don't know what's going on here
[1:54:20.520 --> 1:54:22.520]  They have this lawyer
[1:54:22.520 --> 1:54:24.520]  Trying to tell me none of this is going on
[1:54:24.520 --> 1:54:26.520]  And there was nobody in the woods in Camo that got arrested
[1:54:26.520 --> 1:54:28.520]  Well, here's the deposition
[1:54:28.520 --> 1:54:30.520]  You just saw the news reporting it
[1:54:30.520 --> 1:54:32.520]  Here's the deposition, acting like I made this up
[1:54:32.520 --> 1:54:34.520]  Here it is
[1:54:34.520 --> 1:54:36.520]  What about they're finding people
[1:54:36.520 --> 1:54:38.520]  In the back woods
[1:54:38.520 --> 1:54:40.520]  That are dressed up in SWAT gear
[1:54:40.520 --> 1:54:42.520]  That's not true, is it?
[1:54:42.520 --> 1:54:44.520]  I saw it on the national news
[1:54:44.520 --> 1:54:46.520]  You saw somebody in SWAT gear
[1:54:46.520 --> 1:54:48.520]  In the woods
[1:54:48.520 --> 1:54:50.520]  They got blackened camouflage
[1:54:50.520 --> 1:54:52.520]  The police arrested them
[1:54:52.520 --> 1:54:54.520]  They said there was a SWAT drill in the area
[1:54:54.520 --> 1:54:56.520]  No, Mr. Jones, I'm asking you
[1:54:56.520 --> 1:54:58.520]  Did you see a video of a man in SWAT gear
[1:54:58.520 --> 1:55:00.520]  Being arrested
[1:55:00.520 --> 1:55:02.520]  I saw the helicopter
[1:55:02.520 --> 1:55:04.520]  Talking about it
[1:55:04.520 --> 1:55:06.520]  And they said they later arrested the man
[1:55:10.520 --> 1:55:12.520]  So when you told your audience
[1:55:12.520 --> 1:55:14.520]  He was dressed up in SWAT gear
[1:55:14.520 --> 1:55:16.520]  That's just something you made up, isn't it?
[1:55:16.520 --> 1:55:18.520]  There's nobody dressed up in SWAT gear
[1:55:18.520 --> 1:55:20.520]  I do remember that being on the news
[1:55:20.520 --> 1:55:22.520]  What being on the news?
[1:55:22.520 --> 1:55:24.520]  The helicopter and the man behind the school
[1:55:24.520 --> 1:55:26.520]  And the reporter, the guy in the SWAT gear
[1:55:26.520 --> 1:55:28.520]  And the police saying they arrested them
[1:55:28.520 --> 1:55:30.520]  And later they said they didn't
[1:55:30.520 --> 1:55:32.520]  Yes, two reporters with cameras
[1:55:32.520 --> 1:55:34.520]  There's no man in SWAT gear in that video
[1:55:34.520 --> 1:55:36.520]  Is there?
[1:55:36.520 --> 1:55:38.520]  That's just something you made up
[1:55:38.520 --> 1:55:40.520]  Nope, I didn't make it up
[1:55:40.520 --> 1:55:42.520]  So you think you can produce to me a video
[1:55:42.520 --> 1:55:44.520]  Of a man in SWAT gear in the woods
[1:55:44.520 --> 1:55:46.520]  That was recorded on the news
[1:55:46.520 --> 1:55:48.520]  So now it's not you saw it in the video
[1:55:48.520 --> 1:55:50.520]  Now it's somebody else's
[1:55:50.520 --> 1:55:52.520]  I remember seeing a guy in the video
[1:55:52.520 --> 1:55:54.520]  He was in camo in black
[1:55:54.520 --> 1:55:56.520]  First of all, camo in black
[1:55:56.520 --> 1:55:58.520]  What does that mean? He has camo pants on?
[1:55:58.520 --> 1:56:00.520]  I would tend to think that means
[1:56:00.520 --> 1:56:02.520]  Kind of paramilitary outfit
[1:56:02.520 --> 1:56:04.520]  Anybody you see in camo pants
[1:56:04.520 --> 1:56:06.520]  When you're walking down the street
[1:56:06.520 --> 1:56:08.520]  You're like, I got this paramilitary
[1:56:08.520 --> 1:56:10.520]  Objectionist
[1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:12.520]  Is that your belief?
[1:56:12.520 --> 1:56:14.520]  That a man wearing camo pants
[1:56:14.520 --> 1:56:16.520]  Is being dressed in SWAT gear?
[1:56:16.520 --> 1:56:18.520]  Do you think that's an honest and accurate way
[1:56:18.520 --> 1:56:20.520]  To describe that?
[1:56:20.520 --> 1:56:22.520]  Objectionist uniform
[1:56:22.520 --> 1:56:24.520]  I think that's fairly described
[1:56:24.520 --> 1:56:26.520]  What I'm trying to get at Mr. Jones
[1:56:26.520 --> 1:56:28.520]  Is you don't think saying that a man
[1:56:28.520 --> 1:56:30.520]  Who's dressed up in SWAT gear
[1:56:30.520 --> 1:56:32.520]  Find behind the school
[1:56:32.520 --> 1:56:34.520]  When he's not actually wearing any SWAT gear
[1:56:34.520 --> 1:56:36.520]  Is in any way alarmist or dangerous to say
[1:56:36.520 --> 1:56:42.520]  What's that?
[1:56:42.520 --> 1:56:44.520]  Alright, so if you're a TV viewer
[1:56:44.520 --> 1:56:46.520]  You can see all this
[1:56:46.520 --> 1:56:48.520]  Everyone I talk to goes, yeah, I remember
[1:56:48.520 --> 1:56:50.520]  On the news, we even got a low res
[1:56:50.520 --> 1:56:52.520]  Version, we're digging through all our archives
[1:56:52.520 --> 1:56:54.520]  Because we taped it that day, we have an HD one
[1:56:54.520 --> 1:56:56.520]  When you can totally see the guy in black
[1:56:56.520 --> 1:56:58.520]  Sure, camo, he's in the grass
[1:56:58.520 --> 1:57:00.520]  You can see it in the footage we just showed
[1:57:00.520 --> 1:57:02.520]  With the three cops with guns out on him
[1:57:02.520 --> 1:57:04.520]  They're wearing blues, they stand out
[1:57:04.520 --> 1:57:06.520]  In the grass, but we have local saying
[1:57:06.520 --> 1:57:08.520]  He was in tactical gear
[1:57:08.520 --> 1:57:10.520]  He had a gun, he was back there
[1:57:10.520 --> 1:57:12.520]  In the woods, the cops chasing
[1:57:12.520 --> 1:57:14.520]  I mean, I just showed you
[1:57:14.520 --> 1:57:16.520]  The local news saying
[1:57:16.520 --> 1:57:18.520]  Tactical gear, SWAT gear
[1:57:18.520 --> 1:57:20.520]  I'm not making anything up
[1:57:20.520 --> 1:57:22.520]  I'm not a Russian agent
[1:57:22.520 --> 1:57:24.520]  I love America
[1:57:24.520 --> 1:57:26.520]  I stand for justice, I love my children
[1:57:26.520 --> 1:57:28.520]  I just tell you what I see
[1:57:28.520 --> 1:57:30.520]  I'm not perfect
[1:57:30.520 --> 1:57:32.520]  But the New York Times
[1:57:32.520 --> 1:57:34.520]  Thinks you're so weak
[1:57:34.520 --> 1:57:36.520]  That they will say, look, we got
[1:57:36.520 --> 1:57:38.520]  Jones, there was nobody arrested
[1:57:38.520 --> 1:57:40.520]  In SWAT gear, and the damn paper
[1:57:40.520 --> 1:57:42.520]  Says SWAT gear
[1:57:42.520 --> 1:57:44.520]  All I'm doing is reporting
[1:57:44.520 --> 1:57:46.520]  What was seen
[1:57:46.520 --> 1:57:48.520]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for
[1:57:48.520 --> 1:57:50.520]  Holding so long, go ahead
[1:57:50.520 --> 1:57:52.520]  I just have to say something, man
[1:57:52.520 --> 1:57:54.520]  It seems like every time I turn on
[1:57:54.520 --> 1:57:56.520]  Your broadcast, your bragging
[1:57:56.520 --> 1:57:58.520]  It just gets old, man
[1:57:58.520 --> 1:58:00.520]  I'm going to shut you down right now
[1:58:00.520 --> 1:58:02.520]  Frank, do you understand
[1:58:02.520 --> 1:58:04.520]  They're having congressional hearings
[1:58:04.520 --> 1:58:06.520]  Trying to shut us down
[1:58:06.520 --> 1:58:08.520]  Do you understand, I'm ringing the alarm
[1:58:08.520 --> 1:58:10.520]  If that was happening to anybody else
[1:58:10.520 --> 1:58:12.520]  I'd be freaked out
[1:58:12.520 --> 1:58:14.520]  What's it going to take, us being shut down
[1:58:14.520 --> 1:58:16.520]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[1:58:16.520 --> 1:58:18.520]  I'll put it on pause again
[1:58:18.520 --> 1:58:20.520]  Hey, Frank, do you understand
[1:58:20.520 --> 1:58:22.520]  It's not bragging to say
[1:58:22.520 --> 1:58:24.520]  We're under attack, we need your help
[1:58:24.520 --> 1:58:26.520]  As much begging as I do
[1:58:26.520 --> 1:58:28.520]  We can barely pay the bills
[1:58:28.520 --> 1:58:30.520]  I'm not going to just stop growth
[1:58:30.520 --> 1:58:32.520]  And let them start pushing us backwards
[1:58:32.520 --> 1:58:34.520]  Do you understand, I need your help, Frank
[1:58:34.520 --> 1:58:36.520]  I need your help, Frank
[1:58:36.520 --> 1:58:38.520]  Go to infowarstore.com

[1:58:40.520 --> 1:58:42.520]  The Info War
[1:58:42.520 --> 1:58:44.520]  Do you understand, I need your help, Frank
[1:58:44.520 --> 1:58:46.520]  Free press needs your help, Frank
[1:58:46.520 --> 1:58:48.520]  My Leaps and My Bounds
[1:58:48.520 --> 1:58:50.520]  The number one best selling
[1:58:50.520 --> 1:58:52.520]  Supplement family in the world
[1:58:52.520 --> 1:58:54.520]  Is energy drinks

[1:59:30.520 --> 1:59:32.520]  You must experience it
[1:59:32.520 --> 1:59:34.520]  It is a total game changer
[1:59:34.520 --> 1:59:36.520]  And it comes in easy to use
[1:59:36.520 --> 1:59:38.520]  Packaged, mixed in with fruit juice
[1:59:38.520 --> 1:59:40.520]  Or water, whatever you'd like
[1:59:40.520 --> 1:59:42.520]  Warning though, it's very very strong
[1:59:42.520 --> 1:59:44.520]  Because it will take you into overdrive
[1:59:44.520 --> 2:00:12.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:00:12.520 --> 2:00:34.520]  Music plays
[2:00:34.520 --> 2:00:36.520]  Sirens are calling
[2:00:36.520 --> 2:00:38.520]  For someone they're on the way
[2:00:38.520 --> 2:00:40.520]  Music plays
[2:00:40.520 --> 2:00:42.520]  In which house is it gonna be
[2:00:42.520 --> 2:00:44.520]  Music plays
[2:00:44.520 --> 2:00:46.520]  Since Trevor Muller has
[2:00:46.520 --> 2:00:48.520]  Disappointed the democrats
[2:00:48.520 --> 2:00:50.520]  And Mullertime has turned into
[2:00:50.520 --> 2:00:52.520]  Liberal tears time
[2:00:52.520 --> 2:00:54.520]  Newsweek magazine decided to put
[2:00:54.520 --> 2:00:56.520]  Adam Schiff on the cover this week
[2:00:56.520 --> 2:00:58.520]  Since he vows to continue
[2:00:58.520 --> 2:01:00.520]  Searching for some kind of conspiracy
[2:01:00.520 --> 2:01:02.520]  No one escapes the law
[2:01:02.520 --> 2:01:04.520]  Is the covers caption
[2:01:04.520 --> 2:01:06.520]  Before becoming a literal joke
[2:01:06.520 --> 2:01:08.520]  Newsweek magazine was considered
[2:01:08.520 --> 2:01:14.400]  of the news industry, sets its creation back in 1933, one of which was the Madame Hillary
[2:01:14.400 --> 2:01:19.880]  edition they printed before the 2016 election, which thankfully leaked out.
[2:01:19.880 --> 2:01:25.200]  Perhaps there hadn't been such a big blunder in the media since 1948 when the Chicago Daily
[2:01:25.200 --> 2:01:29.160]  Tribune published the headline, Dewey Defeats Truman.
[2:01:29.160 --> 2:01:34.080]  Only the election results weren't in just yet, which resulted in this iconic photo of
[2:01:34.080 --> 2:01:38.320]  Harry Truman holding the newspaper after his victory.
[2:01:38.320 --> 2:01:44.400]  Newsweek is such a joke that not that long ago the entire magazine sold for $1, not an
[2:01:44.400 --> 2:01:48.320]  issue of the magazine, I mean the entire company of Newsweek.
[2:01:48.320 --> 2:01:52.000]  I'm not joking, you could have owned the entire company for less money than it would
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:56.920]  have cost you to buy an issue of one of their magazines from the grocery store.
[2:01:56.920 --> 2:02:00.680]  The company was so deeply in debt but they were able to unload it to some sucker for
[2:02:00.680 --> 2:02:06.840]  the nominal value of $1 with the agreement that the buyer would then take on their massive
[2:02:06.840 --> 2:02:07.840]  debt.
[2:02:07.840 --> 2:02:11.760]  Things haven't gotten much better for Newsweek, just last year their chairman and financial
[2:02:11.760 --> 2:02:17.840]  director both resigned and made allegations that the company was using bots to artificially
[2:02:17.840 --> 2:02:23.160]  inflate traffic to the website in order to allegedly defraud advertisers.
[2:02:23.160 --> 2:02:28.120]  And it looks like they may have bought millions of fake Twitter followers as well because
[2:02:28.120 --> 2:02:34.720]  most of their tweets barely get a dozen engagements, which is extremely suspicious considering
[2:02:34.720 --> 2:02:39.840]  they have supposedly 3.3 million people following them.
[2:02:39.840 --> 2:02:46.080]  Just look at this tweet from an hour ago about the Mueller Report, it has 4 likes, 4 retweets
[2:02:46.080 --> 2:02:48.080]  and 7 responses.
[2:02:48.080 --> 2:02:56.920]  The tweet just before that, 9 likes, 13 retweets, 11 responses, 11 people responded out of 3.3
[2:02:56.920 --> 2:02:58.800]  million people following it?
[2:02:58.800 --> 2:02:59.800]  Yeah, right.
[2:02:59.800 --> 2:03:06.480]  There's barely a single tweet all day that has over a dozen likes or engagements.
[2:03:06.480 --> 2:03:10.680]  Let's compare this to the official Twitter account for Charmin Toilet Paper, which has
[2:03:10.680 --> 2:03:14.080]  a real account and has 82,000 followers.
[2:03:14.080 --> 2:03:17.920]  So if people want to learn more about the latest toilet paper technology, just take
[2:03:17.920 --> 2:03:20.560]  a look at some of the engagement on their recent tweets.
[2:03:20.560 --> 2:03:26.120]  This one has 17 likes, more than most of them on Newsweek, wow this one has 22 likes and
[2:03:26.120 --> 2:03:30.080]  this one has 26 likes, this one has 70 likes.
[2:03:30.080 --> 2:03:34.880]  I'm not joking, a Twitter account boasting about the latest innovations in toilet paper
[2:03:34.880 --> 2:03:38.160]  has a higher engagement than Newsweek magazine.
[2:03:38.160 --> 2:03:40.880]  If you think about it, this does make perfect sense.
[2:03:40.880 --> 2:03:43.360]  I mean, which brand of toilet paper would you rather use?
[2:03:43.360 --> 2:03:48.640]  Charmin, which costs maybe 50 cents a roll, or Newsweek, which costs probably 4 or 5 dollars
[2:03:48.640 --> 2:03:49.640]  an issue.
[2:03:49.640 --> 2:03:52.640]  The following are real stories from Toilet Paper Week.
[2:03:52.640 --> 2:03:56.720]  Elderly Americans are dying without getting to read Robert Mueller's report and they're
[2:03:56.720 --> 2:03:58.200]  not happy about it.
[2:03:58.200 --> 2:04:05.000]  Trump complained about having to eat f-ing raw fish in Japan in 1990 and ate McDonald's
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:06.120]  instead.
[2:04:06.120 --> 2:04:10.120]  This was an article that they published at the same time President Trump was meeting
[2:04:10.120 --> 2:04:16.480]  with the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, complaining that 30 years prior he said he
[2:04:16.480 --> 2:04:17.480]  didn't like sushi.
[2:04:17.480 --> 2:04:22.920]  Oh, here's one of the best, Hillary Clinton could still become president if Russia probe
[2:04:22.920 --> 2:04:25.240]  finds conspiracy evidence.
[2:04:25.240 --> 2:04:28.320]  Oh, let's not forget this brilliant investigation.
[2:04:28.320 --> 2:04:34.240]  Here's scientific proof that Trump's hands are too small to hold a bottle of water like
[2:04:34.240 --> 2:04:35.880]  a normal adult.
[2:04:35.880 --> 2:04:40.160]  This is literally an article we would expect on BuzzFeed, but not in a magazine that has
[2:04:40.160 --> 2:04:42.160]  the word news in its name.
[2:04:42.160 --> 2:04:44.360]  All right, go ahead and paper this down.
[2:04:44.360 --> 2:04:45.360]  Great job, Mark Dias.
[2:04:45.360 --> 2:04:49.560]  So what Trump does when he goes downstairs or anything is that he's super careful.
[2:04:49.560 --> 2:04:53.840]  I mean, it's crazy how much Trump is like in control of himself.
[2:04:53.840 --> 2:04:54.840]  That's his MO.
[2:04:54.840 --> 2:04:59.600]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[2:04:59.600 --> 2:05:02.600]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the deep earth crystals anymore
[2:05:02.600 --> 2:05:07.040]  for a year and a half fight, but we have the original producer, the original crystal source,
[2:05:07.040 --> 2:05:10.640]  the best atomic iodide in the world, X2 is back.
[2:05:10.640 --> 2:05:11.640]  We got it.
[2:05:11.640 --> 2:05:13.040]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[2:05:13.040 --> 2:05:14.640]  We rushed it into production.
[2:05:14.640 --> 2:05:15.640]  It's been bottled.
[2:05:15.640 --> 2:05:19.880]  The labels are being put on today, and then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler right here
[2:05:19.880 --> 2:05:24.480]  to Austin from the plant in the Rockies, and it's going to be shipped out to you.
[2:05:24.480 --> 2:05:30.400]  Be sure to sign up for auto-ship, get an additional 10% off, the 25% off, celebration of the fact
[2:05:30.400 --> 2:05:32.760]  that we got it back and we're relaunching it.
[2:05:32.760 --> 2:05:34.520]  Research the iodide conspiracy.
[2:05:34.520 --> 2:05:35.560]  Find out why it's so important.
[2:05:35.560 --> 2:05:40.520]  Find out why the globalists don't want you to have the good halogens, the bad halogens
[2:05:40.520 --> 2:05:41.520]  at infowarstore.com.
[2:05:41.520 --> 2:05:46.960]  That's the umbrella site, infowarstore.com, they should write the supplements, and this
[2:05:46.960 --> 2:06:13.280]  is the King Daddy, ladies and gentlemen, it is X2 original now back at infowarstore.com.
[2:06:13.280 --> 2:06:20.880]  And deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex
[2:06:20.880 --> 2:06:21.880]  Jones.
[2:06:21.880 --> 2:06:27.520]  So, I mean, we said the Mueller probe was a fraud, we said as long as we stood up against
[2:06:27.520 --> 2:06:32.080]  it, it would turn out being a giant pit the Democrats dug that they would fall into.
[2:06:32.080 --> 2:06:33.080]  That's now happening.
[2:06:33.080 --> 2:06:37.640]  It's in the report, which has joined us, that the Democrats made 11 payments illegally of
[2:06:37.640 --> 2:06:42.440]  taxpayer money to create the fake dossier to get the fake warrants, and it looks like
[2:06:42.440 --> 2:06:44.360]  President Trump is going to press the attacks.
[2:06:44.360 --> 2:06:45.360]  That's good news.
[2:06:45.360 --> 2:06:48.520]  We're taking your phone calls right now to get your take on this whole thing.
[2:06:48.520 --> 2:06:52.960]  Jack in California, you're on the air, welcome, what is your view on this?
[2:06:52.960 --> 2:06:57.160]  I think it's another giant black eye for the controlled corporate press.
[2:06:57.160 --> 2:07:00.040]  I mean, what a pack of jokers they are.
[2:07:00.040 --> 2:07:04.480]  I think they are a pack of jokers, but I wanted to ask you, because I know you're taking calls
[2:07:04.480 --> 2:07:08.080]  on just the Mueller thing, that's my first comment, but I wanted, if I don't piss you
[2:07:08.080 --> 2:07:13.320]  off too much, I'd like to make a comment regarding the enforce operation and why you're in the
[2:07:13.320 --> 2:07:14.320]  crosshairs.
[2:07:14.320 --> 2:07:17.520]  No, we're not screening your calls.
[2:07:17.520 --> 2:07:21.880]  We're just saying the topic is that, but then what happens when I don't screen the calls,
[2:07:21.880 --> 2:07:25.200]  people are used to talk radio, they do the screening on air.
[2:07:25.200 --> 2:07:26.200]  So it's kind of a weird thing.
[2:07:26.200 --> 2:07:27.200]  Hell, let's screen your calls.
[2:07:27.200 --> 2:07:29.120]  What does he want to talk about today, Jack?
[2:07:29.120 --> 2:07:33.200]  Well, the first thing I want to talk about is that with regard to the Mueller report,
[2:07:33.200 --> 2:07:39.360]  I think that it's a little early to be just getting in the tank and being completely dismissive
[2:07:39.360 --> 2:07:42.440]  of what's being found in that.
[2:07:42.440 --> 2:07:48.680]  I mean, just if you look at the testimony of McGahn and a few others that were insiders,
[2:07:48.680 --> 2:07:52.320]  even if they, in the past, they may have been never Trumpers, I don't doubt any of that.
[2:07:52.320 --> 2:07:53.320]  No, no, no.
[2:07:53.320 --> 2:07:55.960]  Now there's leadership and now that they've been caught, more people are ready to flip
[2:07:55.960 --> 2:07:57.120]  on the deep state.
[2:07:57.120 --> 2:08:01.940]  That's the big opportunity is how many people in the Clinton crime network are now ready
[2:08:01.940 --> 2:08:03.320]  to flip on the deep state.
[2:08:03.320 --> 2:08:04.320]  That's a huge takeaway.
[2:08:04.320 --> 2:08:10.560]  But the point is with regard to this stuff that I've been seeing this morning is that
[2:08:10.560 --> 2:08:14.280]  there's no doubt that Trump rode the line of obstruction.
[2:08:14.280 --> 2:08:15.280]  He really did.
[2:08:15.280 --> 2:08:19.600]  And if you substituted the name Obama for Trump, the people on the right side of the spectrum
[2:08:19.600 --> 2:08:20.680]  would be flipping out.
[2:08:20.680 --> 2:08:22.760]  What are you talking about?
[2:08:22.760 --> 2:08:27.040]  Obama was involved with Al Qaeda and ISIS and Kenya trying to overthrow their government
[2:08:27.040 --> 2:08:32.680]  and suggesting the Clintons and all them are above the law and never get investigated.
[2:08:32.680 --> 2:08:37.880]  I'm referring to just this report and if you took out the name Trump and put it with Obama,
[2:08:37.880 --> 2:08:42.000]  the people on the right side of the spectrum were saying President Obama obstructed justice.
[2:08:42.000 --> 2:08:45.040]  Hey, Trump tried to shut down the investigation.
[2:08:45.040 --> 2:08:46.040]  I get it.
[2:08:46.040 --> 2:08:48.800]  He was pissed because he knows that it was a ruse.
[2:08:48.800 --> 2:08:49.800]  There's no doubt.
[2:08:49.800 --> 2:08:53.640]  But the point is the way he tried to shut it down is not very kosher, dude.
[2:08:53.640 --> 2:08:57.800]  And I think that you've got to be an honest broker with regard to what you see there.
[2:08:57.800 --> 2:09:02.760]  No, I think that's a total fraud sitting there saying, I've done nothing.
[2:09:02.760 --> 2:09:03.760]  This is a fraud.
[2:09:03.760 --> 2:09:07.680]  The Democrats are spying on me is just a total diversion and a distraction.
[2:09:07.680 --> 2:09:10.720]  The Clintons, uranium one, everything they did.
[2:09:10.720 --> 2:09:14.560]  There's no evidence of any obstruction, but I appreciate your call, Jack.
[2:09:14.560 --> 2:09:19.720]  I mean, it's just this thing going back to Mueller, like he's this God.
[2:09:19.720 --> 2:09:21.520]  It's all a giant joke.
[2:09:21.520 --> 2:09:29.840]  Everything goes to intent and the president was pissed off because this was a fraud.
[2:09:29.840 --> 2:09:35.680]  And you've got people trying to overturn an election who paid for a fake dossier.
[2:09:35.680 --> 2:09:39.520]  And then if he's telling people, this is BS, do something about it.
[2:09:39.520 --> 2:09:42.080]  These are a bunch of angry Democrats committing crimes.
[2:09:42.080 --> 2:09:46.800]  He's doing the FBI's job when they've got a bunch of Clintonistas inside the thing, creating
[2:09:46.800 --> 2:09:51.680]  fake dossiers, working with the media and a giant fraud, trying to set up every Trump
[2:09:51.680 --> 2:09:53.160]  supporter as a Russian agent.
[2:09:53.160 --> 2:09:54.320]  They came up empty.
[2:09:54.320 --> 2:09:56.720]  They failed.
[2:09:56.720 --> 2:10:03.680]  You failed establishment.
[2:10:03.680 --> 2:10:04.680]  Anthony in Minnesota.
[2:10:04.680 --> 2:10:05.680]  You're on the air.
[2:10:05.680 --> 2:10:06.680]  Go ahead.
[2:10:06.680 --> 2:10:12.520]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, Alex Bubba Jones, a longtime listener.
[2:10:12.520 --> 2:10:18.280]  I'll do a better job than California here at the Mueller report.
[2:10:18.280 --> 2:10:21.120]  There's a couple of things on that.
[2:10:21.120 --> 2:10:25.280]  I foresee in the nearest future, everything leaks.
[2:10:25.280 --> 2:10:29.920]  So I think there's gonna be a lot more unredacted leak.
[2:10:29.920 --> 2:10:33.160]  And like you said, Trump, we need to go on the offensive.
[2:10:33.160 --> 2:10:38.360]  Like I've pissed off like you too, up here at Minneapolis, but tell you, we got a lot
[2:10:38.360 --> 2:10:40.000]  of brothers up here.
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:47.280]  And the other thing is offensive, we'll finally find out where the WikiLeaks emails really
[2:10:47.280 --> 2:10:48.280]  came from.
[2:10:48.280 --> 2:10:50.800]  We all know that's Seth Rich, one of the first patriots.
[2:10:50.800 --> 2:10:52.960]  Oh, we know they sue anybody that even says that.
[2:10:52.960 --> 2:10:54.160]  You have a right to say Seth Rich.
[2:10:54.160 --> 2:10:55.880]  They don't want you looking into that.
[2:10:55.880 --> 2:10:56.880]  What does that tell you?
[2:10:56.880 --> 2:10:57.880]  Thank you, Anthony.
[2:10:57.880 --> 2:10:58.880]  Great points.
[2:10:58.880 --> 2:10:59.880]  Sandy in Pennsylvania.
[2:10:59.880 --> 2:11:00.880]  You're on the air worldwide.
[2:11:00.880 --> 2:11:01.880]  Thanks for calling today.
[2:11:01.880 --> 2:11:02.880]  Hi, Alex.
[2:11:02.880 --> 2:11:05.960]  Good afternoon, first time caller.
[2:11:05.960 --> 2:11:11.280]  I just want to start off saying about, I'm very grateful for you to be fighting for us
[2:11:11.280 --> 2:11:14.840]  in this country and be a patriotic American.
[2:11:14.840 --> 2:11:17.120]  And God bless the great state of Texas.
[2:11:17.120 --> 2:11:20.400]  That's the only state that I would love to visit and possibly move.
[2:11:20.400 --> 2:11:24.040]  Well, God bless you and the beautiful state of Pennsylvania and I love to fight.
[2:11:24.040 --> 2:11:27.080]  And so let me tell you, I'm as happy as a pig and you know what?
[2:11:27.080 --> 2:11:28.080]  So thank you.
[2:11:28.080 --> 2:11:29.080]  Yes.
[2:11:29.080 --> 2:11:33.880]  And God bless you, your children, your wife and your family, because I know that they
[2:11:33.880 --> 2:11:40.160]  tried to take your children away and just to target and they're jealous to you.
[2:11:40.160 --> 2:11:45.200]  The freedom of speech must live on in this country and people need to wake up.
[2:11:45.200 --> 2:11:50.320]  As far as the Mueller report, it was two years of nightmarish every night listening to the
[2:11:50.320 --> 2:11:54.600]  news about Donald Trump did this, Donald Trump did that.
[2:11:54.600 --> 2:11:56.480]  Democrats are the demon party.
[2:11:56.480 --> 2:12:00.160]  I renamed them the demon party because they hate President Trump.
[2:12:00.160 --> 2:12:01.160]  I'll say this.
[2:12:01.160 --> 2:12:02.160]  They have no bottom now.
[2:12:02.160 --> 2:12:06.040]  I mean, I used to be 50, 50, 20 years ago, I wasn't a Republican or Democrat.
[2:12:06.040 --> 2:12:08.240]  Some stuff Democrats did was good.
[2:12:08.240 --> 2:12:10.680]  But I mean, the Democrats now have converted to pure evil.
[2:12:10.680 --> 2:12:12.400]  I mean, it's just true.
[2:12:12.400 --> 2:12:15.640]  Well, you know, Alex, God knows what they're doing.
[2:12:15.640 --> 2:12:19.440]  There's a retired firefighter that I watch on YouTube.
[2:12:19.440 --> 2:12:20.440]  He's from Florida.
[2:12:20.440 --> 2:12:23.400]  His name is, oh man, Mark Taylor.
[2:12:23.400 --> 2:12:24.880]  If you never heard of him, look him up.
[2:12:24.880 --> 2:12:25.880]  No, I've heard of him.
[2:12:25.880 --> 2:12:26.880]  Really good guy.
[2:12:26.880 --> 2:12:27.880]  We want to get him on.
[2:12:27.880 --> 2:12:28.880]  Yeah.
[2:12:28.880 --> 2:12:33.760]  I want to see him on your show because he's a great person and there's a lot of evilness
[2:12:33.760 --> 2:12:34.760]  on the earth.
[2:12:34.760 --> 2:12:37.840]  And God knows all and this country is being reborn.
[2:12:37.840 --> 2:12:42.200]  And the Democrats and the right, the left wingers, the deep state, they're all going
[2:12:42.200 --> 2:12:44.880]  to be exposed just like the pedophilia that's been going on.
[2:12:44.880 --> 2:12:48.880]  They're rounding people up like cattle because they're hurting innocent children.
[2:12:48.880 --> 2:12:53.720]  And the Democrats deny that pedophilia, it's like nine times the record.
[2:12:53.720 --> 2:12:58.480]  They're arresting real pedophiles with kids in dungeons and it barely gets coverage.
[2:12:58.480 --> 2:13:00.720]  And the media goes, oh, pedophilia doesn't exist.
[2:13:00.720 --> 2:13:05.760]  When they say that, when pedophilia is rampant, you know, these are evil people.
[2:13:05.760 --> 2:13:06.760]  Exactly.
[2:13:06.760 --> 2:13:07.760]  God bless you.
[2:13:07.760 --> 2:13:08.760]  Sandy, you're on fire.
[2:13:08.760 --> 2:13:09.760]  God bless you.
[2:13:09.760 --> 2:13:14.320]  Oh, she could make me really, my heart feel good to hear her strength of her voice.
[2:13:14.320 --> 2:13:18.680]  A lot of callers about Sandy Hook, even though I said we're not going to cover that.
[2:13:18.680 --> 2:13:22.800]  I just, them saying I made up that the news said there was a guy in tactical gear in the
[2:13:22.800 --> 2:13:26.360]  woods when I got five different newscasts and four newspapers.
[2:13:26.360 --> 2:13:28.880]  I didn't even play all the newscast I've got.
[2:13:28.880 --> 2:13:30.560]  They got some nerve, man.
[2:13:30.560 --> 2:13:35.920]  And the prosecutors saying, and the police saying, don't give information out.
[2:13:35.920 --> 2:13:37.080]  There may be another shooter.
[2:13:37.080 --> 2:13:39.040]  This is a month after.
[2:13:39.040 --> 2:13:40.040]  Wow.
[2:13:40.040 --> 2:13:44.560]  Let's go ahead and talk to Miles in Colorado.
[2:13:44.560 --> 2:13:45.560]  Miles, you're on the air.
[2:13:45.560 --> 2:13:46.560]  Thanks for calling.
[2:13:46.560 --> 2:13:47.560]  Hey, Alex.
[2:13:47.560 --> 2:13:51.720]  The honor to talk to you is the first time I've called in.
[2:13:51.720 --> 2:13:52.720]  Thank you, sir.
[2:13:52.720 --> 2:13:59.000]  I just want to say, this whole Mueller report, then like Trump said, it's a government coup
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:04.480]  and trying to spread the fake news and tell us that we're the racists and that we're evil
[2:14:04.480 --> 2:14:05.840]  or we're out to get everybody.
[2:14:05.840 --> 2:14:07.760]  But really, we just want freedom.
[2:14:07.760 --> 2:14:08.760]  We want-
[2:14:08.760 --> 2:14:09.760]  We love America.
[2:14:09.760 --> 2:14:10.760]  We like the flag.
[2:14:10.760 --> 2:14:11.760]  Yeah, we're Russian agents.
[2:14:11.760 --> 2:14:12.760]  We're racist.
[2:14:12.760 --> 2:14:16.240]  We're all because we don't hate the country.
[2:14:16.240 --> 2:14:17.760]  Exactly.
[2:14:17.760 --> 2:14:18.760]  And we just want freedom.
[2:14:18.760 --> 2:14:19.760]  We want peace.
[2:14:19.760 --> 2:14:24.760]  And I really listen to a lot of your speeches, Alex, and I love it because it empowers me
[2:14:24.760 --> 2:14:28.840]  and you want to go to space and you want to do all these things and promote humanity
[2:14:28.840 --> 2:14:31.120]  and promote freedom for all of us.
[2:14:31.120 --> 2:14:32.120]  I love it.
[2:14:32.120 --> 2:14:33.120]  Well, God bless you.
[2:14:33.120 --> 2:14:37.760]  You know, the biggest live scene in Hollywood is a great movie with Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino
[2:14:37.760 --> 2:14:40.960]  called Devil's Advocate, where the devil goes, I'm a fan of humanity.
[2:14:40.960 --> 2:14:41.960]  I want to empower you.
[2:14:41.960 --> 2:14:44.600]  You know, God made humanity and is the fan of humanity.
[2:14:44.600 --> 2:14:48.600]  The devil is an enemy of humanity and loves aborting all these babies and all the rest
[2:14:48.600 --> 2:14:49.600]  of it.
[2:14:49.600 --> 2:14:51.040]  And now they're killing born babies.
[2:14:51.040 --> 2:14:53.080]  I mean, there's no end to these people.
[2:14:53.080 --> 2:14:56.080]  My friend, we must stand against them.
[2:14:56.080 --> 2:14:58.680]  God's a fan of man, not the enemy.
[2:14:58.680 --> 2:15:01.440]  And I'm a fan of humanity and you're a fan.
[2:15:01.440 --> 2:15:04.240]  And I don't want to hear it's a post-human world and I don't want to hear all this crap
[2:15:04.240 --> 2:15:05.640]  from Jack Dorsey.
[2:15:05.640 --> 2:15:08.000]  No Dorsey!
[2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:11.080]  I pledge this and I prophesy this.
[2:15:11.080 --> 2:15:13.680]  Before humanity is destroyed, Jack Dorsey will be destroyed.
[2:15:13.680 --> 2:15:18.560]  And I think Jack Dorsey should get struck by God's thunderbolt like Saul of Tarsus on
[2:15:18.560 --> 2:15:22.120]  the road to Damascus and I think you're going to see a lot of conversions like that very
[2:15:22.120 --> 2:15:23.120]  soon.
[2:15:23.120 --> 2:15:24.120]  Anything else?
[2:15:24.120 --> 2:15:28.240]  I just, I really love what you're talking about, man.
[2:15:28.240 --> 2:15:32.800]  And I support keeping babies alive and support America and support a lot of what you stand
[2:15:32.800 --> 2:15:33.800]  for.
[2:15:33.800 --> 2:15:34.800]  Well, you sound like a terrorist.
[2:15:34.800 --> 2:15:36.400]  You don't want to kill born babies.
[2:15:36.400 --> 2:15:37.400]  What a...
[2:15:37.400 --> 2:15:39.400]  I apologize for that extremism on this show.
[2:15:39.400 --> 2:15:43.960]  I thought about doing a satire show for like a week where I'm a leftist, so don't get
[2:15:43.960 --> 2:15:44.960]  freaked out listeners.
[2:15:44.960 --> 2:15:45.960]  You've been given four warning.
[2:15:45.960 --> 2:15:49.600]  And I'm thinking about doing a whole week as a leftist in character because this is
[2:15:49.600 --> 2:15:50.600]  the real me.
[2:15:50.600 --> 2:15:51.600]  They can say I'm an actor.
[2:15:51.600 --> 2:15:52.600]  Yeah, they're about to find out.
[2:15:52.600 --> 2:15:53.600]  We'll be right back.

[2:17:24.560 --> 2:17:29.960]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[2:17:29.960 --> 2:17:30.960]  the world.

[2:17:39.920 --> 2:17:43.720]  As former colony, the U.S. had to save the empire.

[2:19:52.560 --> 2:20:17.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:17.160 --> 2:20:33.560]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[2:20:33.560 --> 2:20:49.200]  At
[2:20:49.200 --> 2:20:58.080]  the end of the day.
[2:20:58.080 --> 2:21:03.280]  little Christ church thing. Then he tried to fly in last week and got banned because
[2:21:03.280 --> 2:21:07.760]  Comedy Central basically said he was a terrorist because he'd been in the Israeli Defense Forces.
[2:21:07.760 --> 2:21:11.800]  And now it's even bigger scandal. But I wanted to get into his politics, his worldview, the
[2:21:11.800 --> 2:21:15.880]  Mueller report, all the things that are happening, not just the latest on his case. But let's
[2:21:15.880 --> 2:21:22.720]  get into your case to recap it for viewers and radio listeners. It just shows how, even
[2:21:22.720 --> 2:21:27.760]  though Trump's in office, the leftist media is like still in charge. Drudge Report has
[2:21:27.760 --> 2:21:32.040]  a big article it's linked to today about how leftists have just filled up the security
[2:21:32.040 --> 2:21:37.820]  services and if they just make a claim now in the U.S. your guns are taken or non-citizens
[2:21:37.820 --> 2:21:42.120]  are kicked out, they love illegal aliens that haven't been checked at all. But if somebody
[2:21:42.120 --> 2:21:46.240]  with no criminal record who's been here before, who has, you know, is popular in Australia,
[2:21:46.240 --> 2:21:50.880]  if Comedy Central doesn't like you, you're banned. That's pretty scary.
[2:21:50.880 --> 2:21:56.400]  It is. It is scary, Alex. And the fact that we're allowed to happen even when we have
[2:21:56.400 --> 2:22:02.720]  such a conservative government is even more concerning because it seems like no matter
[2:22:02.720 --> 2:22:08.280]  what we do, they still seem to win at least on that side of things.
[2:22:08.280 --> 2:22:14.760]  They've got power over the infrastructure. Of course, TR.News is your site. So I could
[2:22:14.760 --> 2:22:17.320]  ask a lot of questions. What do you want to get into first, recapping what happened to
[2:22:17.320 --> 2:22:22.120]  you or just your view on what's happening in Australia, the West, Notre Dame getting
[2:22:22.120 --> 2:22:28.440]  burned down? They caught a leftist with gas cans clearly trying to burn down St. Patrick's
[2:22:28.440 --> 2:22:32.240]  Cathedral. The media is not covering that. This is getting crazy.
[2:22:32.240 --> 2:22:39.000]  No, all of it, mate. So from where you're at, at the moment, nothing really has changed
[2:22:39.000 --> 2:22:46.320]  too much on our side with regard to, since I last spoke to you. Besides the fact today,
[2:22:46.320 --> 2:22:50.760]  what is interesting is Jim Jeffries is going on Conan O'Brien tonight. So I encourage all
[2:22:50.760 --> 2:22:57.840]  your viewers to maybe tweet out to Conan and see if he's willing to at least pose the question
[2:22:57.840 --> 2:23:05.520]  to Jim and his team today. Because at the end of the day, they keep hiding and wherever
[2:23:05.520 --> 2:23:09.720]  they hide, they're going to find me pushing people to challenge him.
[2:23:09.720 --> 2:23:15.520]  He's so scared that you caught him editing tapes to sound like you're a white supremacist.
[2:23:15.520 --> 2:23:19.520]  When you've got a major legal case, then they're scared enough to say you're a terrorist, trying
[2:23:19.520 --> 2:23:22.400]  to keep you out of the country. I mean, they are really bold.
[2:23:22.400 --> 2:23:27.400]  Yeah, they are. And look, at the moment, we've got the legal team going through everything
[2:23:27.400 --> 2:23:35.280]  and hopefully within the next week we'll have some news about which direction that's heading.
[2:23:35.280 --> 2:23:39.880]  But Bernie Sanders come out and say that my reporter that he threw out of an event who
[2:23:39.880 --> 2:23:44.680]  never even disrupts stuff, Caitlin Bennett, is a white supremacist and I am. Don't they
[2:23:44.680 --> 2:23:49.840]  get when he says that people try to kill us like it's not funny?
[2:23:49.840 --> 2:23:55.120]  No, it isn't funny. And the fact is that I know exactly how that feels because everywhere
[2:23:55.120 --> 2:23:59.520]  I go, no matter how I look, no matter how I dress, no matter if I'm wearing my kippa,
[2:23:59.520 --> 2:24:04.760]  which I often do wear to different events, especially when I do believe that the left
[2:24:04.760 --> 2:24:08.760]  or Antifa are going to be there because I know what their first move is going to be
[2:24:08.760 --> 2:24:17.760]  is to literally label me a Nazi. And on the ground, like I, I as somebody who actually
[2:24:17.760 --> 2:24:24.440]  understands what Nazi means, you know, and somebody who hates Nazis with every last breath
[2:24:24.440 --> 2:24:29.440]  in me, just because, you know, I know I'd be on the top of there, the real now.
[2:24:29.440 --> 2:24:31.760]  Well, sure, they were out to kill your people.
[2:24:31.760 --> 2:24:32.760]  Exactly.
[2:24:32.760 --> 2:24:36.720]  They're out to snuff you out from existing. And then now you're one of them.
[2:24:36.720 --> 2:24:43.840]  Absolutely. I tweeted, I retweeted a video yesterday of an event that I wasn't one of
[2:24:43.840 --> 2:24:50.120]  Tommy, Tommy Robinson's last rally in England, where I literally walked through the Antifa
[2:24:50.120 --> 2:24:56.240]  crowd to get to Thomas and I was talking to a bunch of them. And firstly, they couldn't
[2:24:56.240 --> 2:25:01.080]  answer me. What the meaning of fascist was, you know, Tommy's a fascist, you're a fascist,
[2:25:01.080 --> 2:25:02.080]  you're a fascist.
[2:25:02.080 --> 2:25:04.080]  But radical Islam, it's not a fascist.
[2:25:04.080 --> 2:25:12.440]  Oh, no, no, no, don't be silly, Alex. Radicalism is a peaceful religion. And, and yeah, and
[2:25:12.440 --> 2:25:16.880]  then they started to straight up calling me a Nazi all on camera. And I'm wearing this
[2:25:16.880 --> 2:25:20.960]  kipper on my head and I've walked up to the crowd and the crowd know it, everybody knows
[2:25:20.960 --> 2:25:24.840]  it. I've stood up there in front of 10s. A thousand people.
[2:25:24.840 --> 2:25:29.560]  No, no, no. It's kind of Australia and I guess Israeli term for the little hat that Orthodox
[2:25:29.560 --> 2:25:30.600]  Jews wear.
[2:25:30.600 --> 2:25:37.160]  I am okay. It's keep a is in Hebrew. No young because the new dish keepers in Hebrew and I'm standing there in front of everyone
[2:25:37.160 --> 2:25:41.480]  I said, listen, I just walked through Antifa. What do you think they called me?
[2:25:41.480 --> 2:25:45.680]  I'll give you two options. They are they called me a racist or a Nazi and everybody understood straight away
[2:25:46.320 --> 2:25:51.840]  Everybody knows that these people don't understand the hypocrisy and what they do understand. They're the racist
[2:25:51.840 --> 2:25:53.840]  They're using race-based politics. They're using
[2:25:53.840 --> 2:26:01.960]  Communist liberation theology and they're pissed that conservatives and nationalists are unifying people according to our political ideas and
[2:26:02.040 --> 2:26:06.200]  Economics that is the real unifying factor instead of their race-based Marxist crap
[2:26:06.920 --> 2:26:09.960]  You're probably right Alex. You're probably right. So let me ask you this
[2:26:09.960 --> 2:26:14.480]  How do we counter these people and discourage because they break all the rules they do whatever they want?
[2:26:14.480 --> 2:26:19.520]  I think we politically worldwide are starting to win. Maybe I'm wrong correct me if you think so, but still like you said
[2:26:19.520 --> 2:26:26.400]  They're still in they're still in power. We're winning the argument, but they're in power and are now oppressing us. What do we do?
[2:26:27.480 --> 2:26:30.200]  You're right, and it's it's a struggle
[2:26:30.200 --> 2:26:34.680]  I think a lot of us have to deal with because you don't want to stoop down to their level
[2:26:36.640 --> 2:26:40.080]  But it would feel good when they when they hit you to knock them up side the head
[2:26:42.840 --> 2:26:45.840]  No comment Alex, but yes, I get where you're coming from
[2:26:45.840 --> 2:26:51.200]  Say you're calling for violence. I'm not I'm saying somebody tries to say knock you in the head with a hammer
[2:26:51.200 --> 2:26:53.200]  You have a right to defend yourself
[2:26:53.280 --> 2:26:57.280]  Absolutely, and I always I waste popular people's right self-defense. That's one thing
[2:26:57.280 --> 2:27:01.920]  But we know very well the left don't do that the left do inside violence the left do
[2:27:02.520 --> 2:27:07.880]  Love to docks people and encourage others to come to your house and and actually hurt you
[2:27:07.880 --> 2:27:13.080]  I just don't I think that we need to win because we will win because we have the truth on our side
[2:27:13.080 --> 2:27:17.800]  No, I agree. We need to be like Gandhi and even take it on the channel. We have to but what do you do when you're with your kids?
[2:27:17.800 --> 2:27:21.760]  And they come to you in public and are getting around you because that's that's that's how people I know
[2:27:21.760 --> 2:27:24.640]  That's when you just it starts punching some buttons. I
[2:27:26.400 --> 2:27:29.840]  Think in that moment you're gonna think more about
[2:27:31.400 --> 2:27:38.520]  Your kids and what you want to display for them and how you want to show them to deal with these kinds of situations and how to really
[2:27:39.080 --> 2:27:41.080]  to use a term man up and
[2:27:41.080 --> 2:27:44.840]  And deal with the property and that's not I don't think that's backing down
[2:27:44.840 --> 2:27:47.600]  I think that's stepping up to the next level because
[2:27:48.280 --> 2:27:54.840]  It's not gonna help us if all outside. No, no, I agree. Yeah, how do you control yourself and they're surrounding you spending on you?
[2:27:56.520 --> 2:28:03.180]  Look, I haven't been in situations where I've been tested to that level. I have most
[2:28:03.760 --> 2:28:07.680]  Most most situations. I've had people come up and challenge me. That's what you know
[2:28:07.680 --> 2:28:13.400]  Let's talk about we come back, but be personally when they always look like demons and so pathetic that I just realized
[2:28:13.520 --> 2:28:16.880]  They want me to punch them in the face. I'm not gonna do it and nine times
[2:28:16.880 --> 2:28:20.360]  I was gonna control myself, but I'm getting sometimes where it's just hard
[2:28:20.360 --> 2:28:23.800]  So I want to ask you how you don't do it. We'll be right back with our guests
[2:28:23.800 --> 2:28:25.160]  We're also gonna talk about

[2:28:36.080 --> 2:28:38.080]  And I agree with him. We're winning
[2:28:38.960 --> 2:28:43.960]  Intellectual battle so the control left wants to start a fight. How do we turn the other cheek?
[2:28:43.960 --> 2:28:49.780]  That's a big question because I I agree we need to do it, but it's really hard to do stay with us

[2:34:28.920 --> 2:34:33.880]  Obviously, I've been up here asking the questions, but talk about maybe your political awakening
[2:34:34.560 --> 2:34:39.240]  Because you're just I mean, I've watched a lot of your videos even before you got banned and censored
[2:34:39.240 --> 2:34:48.200]  Pretty common sense stuff that when Islam comes in it always plays nice until it's a certain level then it starts terror attacks
[2:34:48.360 --> 2:34:55.000]  Then it makes governments agree to its speech codes. It's it's surreal law and then once it does that it takes over
[2:34:55.000 --> 2:34:59.240]  That's why the countries that Islam are in or all the or all Islamic or in civil wars
[2:34:59.240 --> 2:35:01.520]  And so people say why are you being anti-Islam?
[2:35:01.520 --> 2:35:05.200]  Well, I mean, I'm not gonna convert to that and cut my daughter's genitals off
[2:35:05.200 --> 2:35:09.400]  And I don't want to throw gay people off buildings and also don't want to blow Israel up
[2:35:09.400 --> 2:35:13.560]  And then there's this mental illness out there by the left allied with radical Islam
[2:35:14.360 --> 2:35:19.320]  That Israel runs everything and for me being involved in geopolitics for 20-something years
[2:35:19.320 --> 2:35:26.920]  I mean China is the biggest player manipulating other than big lobbies and big think tanks and maybe the defense industry or the big
[2:35:26.920 --> 2:35:32.400]  Or Hollywood lobbies or whatever, but the and then most of Hollywood's liberal Jews, you know that are self-hating
[2:35:32.400 --> 2:35:38.320]  So so this whole ethos of hating Jews and then putting them into every bracket of their causing the problem
[2:35:38.320 --> 2:35:45.080]  I've just never really found that I've never run into that and and then I see Laura Loomer or you or others
[2:35:45.800 --> 2:35:51.120]  Particularly Facebook and other sites banning you when you criticize people like Ilhan Omar
[2:35:51.120 --> 2:35:53.760]  I just it seems like there's a real leftist
[2:35:54.320 --> 2:35:58.660]  Hard-on for nationalist or conservative Jews. Is that inaccurate?
[2:35:58.660 --> 2:36:06.900]  No, it's true. And look, I think those conspiracy theories. I've had to deal with them since I first started speaking out and
[2:36:07.500 --> 2:36:10.780]  One of the things I point out to these people that push those agendas
[2:36:11.380 --> 2:36:16.340]  Who'd like to say that for example, the United Nations is run by
[2:36:17.420 --> 2:36:20.780]  Vizionist, you know lobby groups and I
[2:36:21.380 --> 2:36:27.540]  Say to them well look at the United Nations for example if Jews run the world if Jews really run the United
[2:36:27.540 --> 2:36:29.660]  Why do you and keep voting to get rid of Israel?
[2:36:31.060 --> 2:36:38.260]  There are more UN resolutions against that tiny little state and there is combined against the rest of the world
[2:36:39.460 --> 2:36:43.900]  There is no way that the Jewish state is is controlling anything and the Zionist
[2:36:44.220 --> 2:36:48.500]  But the term Zionism I think most people that use it don't actually understand what it means
[2:36:48.500 --> 2:36:52.140]  It's like a dirty word to them. They don't realize especially
[2:36:52.700 --> 2:36:56.100]  Nationalists on the right side of politics who who have just heard it
[2:36:56.100 --> 2:37:02.180]  Pushed by real anti-Semites whether on the left or the right both the hard left and the hard right are
[2:37:02.300 --> 2:37:07.460]  Two sides of the same coin that pushed the same conspiracy theory the same narrative
[2:37:07.860 --> 2:37:12.340]  And I think a lot of good people in the middle get caught up and start using this time
[2:37:12.340 --> 2:37:16.820]  I've heard people even say it to me. Are these one of the good Jews? He's not a Zionist and
[2:37:17.260 --> 2:37:21.460]  I actually turned him ago. I am a Zionist. I'm a proud Zionist
[2:37:21.460 --> 2:37:26.100]  Do you know what the the the term Zionist? Do you know what the definition actually is?
[2:37:26.100 --> 2:37:32.740]  And if you're a nationalist and you believe in nationalist ideas, you should actually be supporting Zionism
[2:37:33.020 --> 2:37:37.180]  Because any nationalist supports every other country's nationalism
[2:37:37.180 --> 2:37:42.380]  That's the idea is that you should be proud and support my point is that there's this mythical power
[2:37:43.220 --> 2:37:47.300]  Given into Israel and then the whole UN people go all the Rothschilds help make Israel
[2:37:47.300 --> 2:37:54.180]  Yeah, well now they're against Netanyahu trying to get rid of it. I mean those are facts. So my thing is like you said Israel is like tiny
[2:37:54.180 --> 2:38:00.180]  It's the size of Dallas Fort Worth basically and there's this obsession and I was never for Israel or against Israel
[2:38:00.180 --> 2:38:04.500]  It wasn't on my radar until everybody kept saying there's a litmus test say you hate Israel
[2:38:04.500 --> 2:38:07.300]  We're gonna say you work for the Jews and there's a part of me that you know
[2:38:07.300 --> 2:38:13.460]  It's gonna be bossed around so I'm like well screw you so then they all came after me and it seems like a massive mental illness
[2:38:13.460 --> 2:38:15.060]  I just don't get it
[2:38:15.060 --> 2:38:18.540]  It is look. It's uh, it's it's been around
[2:38:19.340 --> 2:38:22.700]  since the beginning of the Jewish people I think
[2:38:23.940 --> 2:38:29.740]  You know, I don't I really hate the word because it's been used too much the idea the word of
[2:38:30.900 --> 2:38:36.780]  Antisemitism it's it's used by people within my own community to silence anyone from
[2:38:37.500 --> 2:38:41.100]  From anything and then it's the same people would push push the Islamophobia
[2:38:41.100 --> 2:38:44.980]  It's the leftist Jewish groups say open up to Islam
[2:38:44.980 --> 2:38:48.500]  It's loving do whatever and then we get Soros documents and get rid of Israel
[2:38:48.900 --> 2:38:53.260]  And and then they have the right-wing attacking me because I don't want to blow Israel up and that's exactly right
[2:38:53.260 --> 2:38:59.380]  What do you do about the leftist Jewish groups that are the ones out there persecuting people who actually stand up for Israel?
[2:38:59.380 --> 2:39:06.460]  This is sick and and we need to stand up to them because the fact is that there is a big part of the Jewish community
[2:39:06.460 --> 2:39:12.980]  Who today are not part of the establishment? They actually are part of the people and
[2:39:13.860 --> 2:39:19.700]  They get condemned by the establishment by groups like the ADL in America
[2:39:20.380 --> 2:39:26.660]  And we have similar ones here. We get condemned by them because we are not following their narrative
[2:39:26.660 --> 2:39:30.540]  I heard like Laura Loomer said the other day. We're not the right type of Jews
[2:39:30.780 --> 2:39:35.100]  But the fact is we're actually the majority the majority of Jews
[2:39:35.100 --> 2:39:38.900]  I believe especially in Israel are our conservatives
[2:39:39.380 --> 2:39:46.260]  But even even here in Australia even in America when you talk about orthodox Jews, especially they are
[2:39:47.180 --> 2:39:51.300]  Conservative they are Jim Jeffries that tried to set you up. He says
[2:39:52.900 --> 2:39:58.900]  What's the only thing that can unify a Jew with the Nazis? Well, that's being anti-Muslim. He calls you a Nazi
[2:39:58.900 --> 2:40:00.900]  He knows exactly what he's doing
[2:40:00.900 --> 2:40:06.820]  And that's what they do. That's their that's their narrative, and I bet you that there are those in the
[2:40:07.460 --> 2:40:13.220]  Jewish establishment that that even though I caught Jim Jeffries out supporting and it is wrong
[2:40:13.580 --> 2:40:17.580]  It is it is wrong just in the fact that there is no
[2:40:18.340 --> 2:40:19.940]  similarities between
[2:40:19.940 --> 2:40:25.580]  Myself Laura Loomer or any other conservative Jew Jews to those neo-Nazis
[2:40:25.580 --> 2:40:29.820]  Well, let's say a lot of the white supremacist groups are funded by the leftist groups
[2:40:29.820 --> 2:40:32.980]  They've been caught they don't they attack conservatives all day long
[2:40:33.260 --> 2:40:39.340]  They obsess over conservative Jews all it's all about are you for sovereignty and free market and nation-states?
[2:40:39.340 --> 2:40:43.980]  Are you for globalism and communism in this one-world government with the mussels Islam?
[2:40:43.980 --> 2:40:47.580]  And so the truth is whether you're Jewish or Christian or are non-radical Muslim
[2:40:47.580 --> 2:40:51.460]  Whether you're an agnostic if you want to live in a free market country with freedom and be left alone
[2:40:51.460 --> 2:40:57.140]  You want to live in the West and if you want to be enslaved by something you join the left whether it's communism or or fascist?
[2:40:57.460 --> 2:41:02.900]  You know Islam, and I think that's what it is. They want to bully everyone into submitting to their system
[2:41:03.460 --> 2:41:06.780]  But I think it's important to note that just because somebody calls himself
[2:41:07.580 --> 2:41:12.740]  Something by name it doesn't make them that for example if somebody says they're right wing
[2:41:13.460 --> 2:41:18.700]  Doesn't mean they're right wing. They could be very well left or just if somebody calls themselves
[2:41:18.700 --> 2:41:24.340]  Anti-fascist it doesn't make them anti-fascist. I've gotten into these argument numerous times on the street
[2:41:24.940 --> 2:41:30.820]  When interviewing they you know, they'll come back to they go, but they're anti-fascist. Are you against anti-fascist?
[2:41:30.820 --> 2:41:33.220]  I go no, they're anti-far that doesn't
[2:41:36.620 --> 2:41:42.340]  Well exactly with so many white supremacists turn out to be leftist and they'll be on TV and say oh, we want socialism
[2:41:42.460 --> 2:41:47.740]  We won't say that's what they want national socialism. Well, yes, they're following their leader
[2:41:47.740 --> 2:41:55.740]  That's exactly right. So that's why I think it is important just to change to talk to anyone
[2:41:55.740 --> 2:42:01.820]  And when we discuss anything we challenge the ideas and not whatever box
[2:42:01.820 --> 2:42:06.620]  They put themselves into or what box anyone else puts them into it's about ideas
[2:42:07.340 --> 2:42:09.700]  That's the truth and the lefts look at demographics
[2:42:09.700 --> 2:42:17.060]  And so they say will be race-based to make it third world against the West which is seen as white when the West is really an
[2:42:17.060 --> 2:42:21.660]  Idea that anybody could adopt and then unify and be successful when we come back
[2:42:21.780 --> 2:42:27.140]  We got a few calls the Mueller report, but I want to ask you then gut level. You're a smart guy Twitter
[2:42:27.940 --> 2:42:30.340]  People can follow you tr.news as well
[2:42:30.340 --> 2:42:35.740]  I want to ask you gut level. Are we winning this fight or where do you see things going and with the Mueller report?
[2:42:35.940 --> 2:42:41.700]  Falling apart for them. What do you think they're gonna do next straight ahead with our guest Abby Yemeni?
[2:42:41.700 --> 2:42:47.380]  I'm Alex Jones with news wars comm and info wars comm the only way the articles get out
[2:42:47.380 --> 2:42:52.340]  The only way the news feeds get out the only way the audio and video feeds get out is you and I'm not bitching saying hey do more
[2:42:52.340 --> 2:42:54.340]  I'm saying please we're in a fight. Help us
[2:42:55.460 --> 2:42:57.460]  There is a publicly admitted
[2:42:57.860 --> 2:42:59.860]  international plan to shut down
[2:43:00.540 --> 2:43:06.860]  Nationalist pro-free market pro-western speech all across the world and I don't want to say I'm honored
[2:43:06.860 --> 2:43:13.540]  But in a way, I am to have been chosen first last year to media platform then they set the precedent now
[2:43:13.540 --> 2:43:17.540]  If you try to tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert
[2:43:17.900 --> 2:43:19.900]  They take you off the internet now
[2:43:20.540 --> 2:43:27.940]  Google announced just today that they're not going to take Christian advertising of most types on their platform because it upsets the San Francisco
[2:43:28.540 --> 2:43:30.100]  Google employees
[2:43:30.100 --> 2:43:34.180]  Our country in the world more and more is in the grip of anti-free speech
[2:43:34.580 --> 2:43:36.420]  hyper leftist
[2:43:36.420 --> 2:43:37.780]  anti-human
[2:43:37.780 --> 2:43:43.020]  Transhumanists who literally think they own and run our lives and if we keep bowing to these cults
[2:43:43.260 --> 2:43:49.660]  The cancer that is San Francisco and many of these big universities is going to be the operating system of the planet
[2:43:50.060 --> 2:43:53.580]  Humanity must awaken and say no to these control freaks
[2:43:54.820 --> 2:43:58.700]  Infowars store.com is how you support us and it's not like we're selling stuff

[2:44:59.820 --> 2:45:05.180]  I'm not doing Bitcoin pumping dumps with Jack Dorsey. I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures
[2:45:05.180 --> 2:45:08.860]  I'm not sitting here, you know selling you late-term abortion and all the great it is
[2:45:08.860 --> 2:45:11.700]  I just go out and say what is the top heart pill?
[2:45:11.700 --> 2:45:17.100]  What is the top tumor? It's the best seller because it's anti-inflammatory and what's the best lab in the country?
[2:45:17.100 --> 2:45:20.540]  Okay, they're the highest rate. I'm like you're only 50% curcuminoid. Well, yeah
[2:45:20.540 --> 2:45:23.740]  They only put five dollars product and bottle, but that's still incredible, sir
[2:45:23.740 --> 2:45:29.180]  I'm like, uh, what's the hottest you could do a month later 90 95% no one's ever done
[2:45:29.180 --> 2:45:35.380]  I said how much that cost for bottle that cost $10 no one's ever done that sir the average competitors three to five percent
[2:45:35.380 --> 2:45:39.580]  You're the top brands 50% like we're gonna have 95 percent curcuminoid
[2:45:39.580 --> 2:45:43.100]  I mean you understand like that's like our information is explosive our fish oil
[2:45:43.100 --> 2:45:48.740]  I go out and I get the cleanest the best my children take it you think I'm gonna give you fish oil
[2:45:48.740 --> 2:45:55.420]  They didn't the very damn best on my soul. You think I'm gonna screw somebody over like one of these devil worshippers never in foreshore.com
[2:45:56.780 --> 2:46:02.620]  I want to say brain force is great. I want to say turbo force is amazing. It is but if you took it with fish oil
[2:46:03.500 --> 2:46:09.820]  It's like the fish oil hill is it the fish oil is better than it and that's an example of what I'm talking about fish oil is
[2:46:10.220 --> 2:46:15.260]  Liquid energy brain body heart the cleanest the best out there. You've got the
[2:46:15.260 --> 2:46:21.500]  Children's you've got the adults got the krill oil if you're gonna get the full effect the fish oil and the children's are really strong
[2:46:21.500 --> 2:46:26.060]  They don't give you the burpees but krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps and I'm sorry
[2:46:26.060 --> 2:46:31.380]  You want something like this? You don't get stuff for free the krill is hallucinogenic. It's so good in my view
[2:46:31.380 --> 2:46:36.300]  I'm not a human medical statement here, but let me tell you something I eat five camplets of krill oil before I go to bed
[2:46:36.300 --> 2:46:38.300]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night
[2:46:38.300 --> 2:46:44.400]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is
[2:46:46.980 --> 2:46:53.180]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you know as I just obsessed cuz whatever the best is we've got I just can't lie to you
[2:46:53.180 --> 2:46:55.180]  I just can't do it
[2:46:55.180 --> 2:47:05.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:47:12.740 --> 2:47:17.860]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[2:47:17.860 --> 2:47:33.020]  The boys tell how about your fellow and left his living in cheap hotels the deserts client leave lens cold
[2:47:34.260 --> 2:47:37.900]  So I'll be Yemeni's our guest two more segments like a few your calls her in a moment
[2:47:38.020 --> 2:47:42.220]  The dr. Dick Beckett shoes in town visiting well this is taking over in the fourth hour a little bit in the fourth hour
[2:47:42.220 --> 2:47:47.180]  You're a winner. I like what Tommy Robinson says he says
[2:47:47.900 --> 2:47:50.140]  I'm not a victim. I'm a target
[2:47:51.140 --> 2:47:54.540]  But still when you watch mainstream news and catch them in lies
[2:47:55.260 --> 2:47:57.940]  Okay, they're lying, but when you experience
[2:47:59.380 --> 2:48:06.300]  Multi-hour interviews where they edit different questions in with different answers to say you're a white supremacist and try to get you killed
[2:48:06.300 --> 2:48:08.300]  I mean, let's just be honest
[2:48:08.300 --> 2:48:10.300]  Because they're left as viewers believe this crap
[2:48:10.300 --> 2:48:17.540]  When they pull that there's a feeling for me of you need to pay for this and it's not like I'm pissed
[2:48:17.540 --> 2:48:21.420]  I want a vendetta. It's like you've gotten away with this so long
[2:48:21.980 --> 2:48:26.180]  You need to get in trouble now. They've gotten in trouble because they have no credibility. They've lost viewers
[2:48:26.180 --> 2:48:31.940]  But there's got to be something more. I mean, how do you handle them lying about you and trying to set you up?
[2:48:31.940 --> 2:48:33.780]  Because I don't think the average viewer
[2:48:33.780 --> 2:48:40.580]  Understands it's one thing to be raped by the media and be lied to it's another thing to have them personally try to like
[2:48:40.580 --> 2:48:44.700]  He does on the video try to you know, I hate Muslims blah blah blah. You know, I don't hate Muslims
[2:48:44.700 --> 2:48:49.220]  He's trying to trick you to do what he wants. He still fails, but then he just edits it
[2:48:49.220 --> 2:48:55.820]  It's something about the cheating that just it's beyond pisses me off. It's like an itch. You can't scratch
[2:48:55.820 --> 2:48:57.820]  You know, I mean you get what I'm saying
[2:48:57.820 --> 2:49:05.100]  Absolutely, but I think listen, I I am somebody as cliche as it sounds. I think that you know truth will always
[2:49:06.020 --> 2:49:09.940]  prevail and I am grateful in this case that I did
[2:49:10.900 --> 2:49:14.260]  Covered myself by filming and all I did was release the truth
[2:49:14.820 --> 2:49:16.940]  So the truth is always gonna win
[2:49:17.940 --> 2:49:23.180]  And and the way to fire back is exactly what I did. I would never go into any situation
[2:49:23.180 --> 2:49:26.020]  Oh, you've got a record every interview with my friend medium
[2:49:26.020 --> 2:49:28.020]  absolutely and
[2:49:29.060 --> 2:49:34.820]  Because at the end of the day, you don't want it to be your word against his because they had the money they have the
[2:49:35.940 --> 2:49:39.180]  The platform, but if you notice, they're not gonna be always lie
[2:49:40.780 --> 2:49:43.220]  Absolutely, that's their job. They are paid liars
[2:49:43.580 --> 2:49:50.980]  They are paid to lie and the the fact is that they will not fess up even I don't know what point they will have right now
[2:49:50.980 --> 2:49:55.660]  I don't know because they haven't even fessed up to it. They're pretending like nothing happened
[2:49:55.700 --> 2:50:02.140]  That's why I'm pushing people today to go and tweet Conan and Jim Jeff and everyone because it's just you just watch
[2:50:02.380 --> 2:50:07.180]  What happens online and they're just deleting everything pretending it never happened
[2:50:07.340 --> 2:50:10.700]  But the people are waiting and that is only feeding to
[2:50:11.460 --> 2:50:14.700]  to support us and outside of things and the truth because
[2:50:14.700 --> 2:50:22.300]  People are realizing people are waking up. I've seen so many tweets of people who are not necessarily even my fan
[2:50:22.300 --> 2:50:28.020]  Don't even like what I stand for don't even agree with my opinions, but they said they're saying
[2:50:28.540 --> 2:50:30.540]  Jim I was your biggest fan
[2:50:30.900 --> 2:50:33.060]  But what you did is actually wrong
[2:50:33.580 --> 2:50:41.020]  How are you not even confronting this? How are you not apologizing? How are you not deleting what you put up?
[2:50:41.020 --> 2:50:44.460]  um, so I think that if we keep doing what we're doing and
[2:50:45.900 --> 2:50:51.340]  Everybody just makes sure that if you if you are right if you do have the truth on your side
[2:50:51.660 --> 2:50:58.140]  just makes all you capture it because the way they've won till now is by being deceitful and
[2:50:59.980 --> 2:51:04.660]  Everyone else not having a way to to to prove the truth
[2:51:04.660 --> 2:51:09.340]  Oh, here's another example. They spent six months where I grew up outside Dallas and
[2:51:09.340 --> 2:51:17.700]  And put on two MPR reports and I listened to them and 90% of its people. I never knew the stories are completely fake
[2:51:18.180 --> 2:51:22.860]  They said all my teeth were knocked out and I was beat up none of that was true
[2:51:22.860 --> 2:51:29.280]  And but you're listening. This is on national radio and it's all lies and you and you and you're like
[2:51:30.180 --> 2:51:33.180]  It's just if they're so deceptive. It's incredible
[2:51:33.180 --> 2:51:40.100]  I listen I until it until I personally experienced it. I thought anybody that was saying that
[2:51:41.020 --> 2:51:45.100]  Anybody that was trying to tell me that the you know, the fake news are that fake?
[2:51:45.100 --> 2:51:48.020]  I thought they were crazy conspiracy theorists
[2:51:48.020 --> 2:51:55.580]  I thought or I thought they were just lying themselves because they came off looking bad until I managed to experience it myself. I
[2:51:56.580 --> 2:51:59.020]  Just wouldn't believe people that the amazing thing
[2:51:59.020 --> 2:52:06.220]  I think I'm gonna thank Jim Jeffery for and Comedy Central for is the fact that they just they've just made it so easy for people to finally
[2:52:06.820 --> 2:52:08.820]  Get around it and understand
[2:52:09.220 --> 2:52:14.580]  That it is real. It is really more real than you can have ever imagined
[2:52:16.220 --> 2:52:22.140]  What do you think the Democrats do now that their Mueller reports come up to empty what's gonna be their new hoax? I
[2:52:22.140 --> 2:52:28.220]  Don't I don't know. I don't know. I can't you know, I try to stoop to their level and think how they would think
[2:52:28.860 --> 2:52:32.820]  You know, you know every time I think you can't make
[2:52:33.380 --> 2:52:37.260]  This up every even you know any lower any worse any more
[2:52:38.020 --> 2:52:41.740]  They seem to surprise me. So I'm sure that they're gonna come up with something
[2:52:42.300 --> 2:52:46.420]  But they failed they've been failing the last what I agreed
[2:52:46.420 --> 2:52:51.500]  Joe Cabineau just a small it like an hour after he's got a noose around his necks
[2:52:51.500 --> 2:52:54.100]  And it happened at 230 in the middle of a frozen wasteland
[2:52:54.180 --> 2:52:59.900]  Of course the cops and then they catch him and he gets off still. I mean that just shows the insanity of this
[2:53:00.420 --> 2:53:03.020]  And they can then like, you know, and they will not
[2:53:03.940 --> 2:53:06.500]  They they won't they won't ever admit to defeat
[2:53:07.660 --> 2:53:13.140]  They will just move on to the next thing pretend like they didn't lose but let's remind everyone that
[2:53:13.140 --> 2:53:18.580]  You know before Trump was getting elected. They promised us there's no way he was gonna get elected
[2:53:18.860 --> 2:53:24.460]  When he got elected they promised us he's gonna be impeached in weeks. He hasn't been impeached now
[2:53:24.900 --> 2:53:26.900]  They've thrown one after the other
[2:53:28.940 --> 2:53:34.100]  Conspiracy theory is he was controlled by the Russians we need to impeach him. We need it. No, he wasn't controlled by the Russians
[2:53:34.100 --> 2:53:35.380]  He wasn't
[2:53:35.380 --> 2:53:39.260]  Nothing to do with him. He's not gonna win 2020. He'll win 2020
[2:53:39.260 --> 2:53:46.140]  So I think Trump is the perfect example of how if you stay to truth
[2:53:46.980 --> 2:53:55.060]  You win you may not like the tree you may not like the sound you may not but like the look you may not like anything about it
[2:53:55.780 --> 2:54:00.500]  But at the end of the day, tree does prevail. Well, that's the thing really tracking policy
[2:54:01.260 --> 2:54:06.020]  Trump's delivered like 90% even a dictator couldn't do that. I couldn't do that
[2:54:06.020 --> 2:54:12.500]  I think that's hard for the Democrats or for liberals to swallow because show me one liberal leader that's
[2:54:12.900 --> 2:54:16.540]  Kept any of their promises during campaigning
[2:54:17.420 --> 2:54:20.060]  Well, Trump realizes the power of delivering
[2:54:20.660 --> 2:54:21.860]  He literally
[2:54:21.860 --> 2:54:27.460]  Neurotically is obsessed with delivering and they even have to admit that but it's just it's like they just don't know what to do
[2:54:27.460 --> 2:54:35.060]  Absolutely, and I think he's set a new a new bar, but I
[2:54:36.620 --> 2:54:38.020]  Think for them
[2:54:38.020 --> 2:54:45.260]  They said it's almost like they're saying Trump is so bad. Look at him. He's just he's done all these bad things
[2:54:45.260 --> 2:54:51.220]  And when they list them out, it's I turn around and I say well, that's what he promised your campaign for
[2:54:51.460 --> 2:54:56.140]  Yeah, the wall, of course, we want the wall. That's was one of his major campaigns
[2:54:56.140 --> 2:54:59.980]  Why are you getting so angry about it America voted for the wall?
[2:55:01.620 --> 2:55:05.360]  We're bordering a bunch of collapsing third world countries. We better build it. I
[2:55:07.420 --> 2:55:09.420]  Degree I agree with that one and
[2:55:10.060 --> 2:55:17.020]  interestingly enough on the on that Jim Jeffries episode where the part that he didn't air when we were talking about the border wall
[2:55:17.540 --> 2:55:23.340]  I gave him the example of if anyone's been to Israel and you have the wall between
[2:55:23.340 --> 2:55:31.780]  The West Bank so the territories which they want as a Palestinian state and Israel where
[2:55:32.620 --> 2:55:34.620]  before that war was
[2:55:34.780 --> 2:55:39.140]  Was built we were having high illegal immigration
[2:55:39.860 --> 2:55:45.120]  Israel was having high high level of suicide that terror attacks coming from those
[2:55:45.540 --> 2:55:49.180]  Territories and since those daily maulings at the at the at the border entrance
[2:55:49.180 --> 2:55:56.740]  I was there were not even at the border. They were coming in through to Israel and bombing in the heart of Jerusalem in buses in cafes
[2:55:56.740 --> 2:55:58.740]  in in Tel Aviv even and
[2:55:59.740 --> 2:56:04.400]  Since that border wall was built. It's gone down about
[2:56:05.900 --> 2:56:07.220]  99.95%
[2:56:07.220 --> 2:56:12.380]  So I put it to Jim. I said him you see I've given you an example where border walls work
[2:56:13.260 --> 2:56:15.260]  So we can say walls work
[2:56:15.260 --> 2:56:23.660]  And he said oh, yes, but you can't build it at such a big scale on on on the southern border in the U.S.
[2:56:23.660 --> 2:56:29.860]  I and I challenged him I said him and he never aired this I said then you could see it on my patreon the whole hours up
[2:56:29.860 --> 2:56:34.380]  I said Jim but can come because the premise of your question was border walls don't work
[2:56:34.380 --> 2:56:41.560]  I've given you an example where it works. It works to such a level that all Israelis from the left and the right
[2:56:41.560 --> 2:56:44.360]  Are grateful for this wall
[2:56:45.160 --> 2:56:49.880]  So walls work now if you're saying that there's a problem in building it so large
[2:56:49.880 --> 2:56:56.240]  All right, let's get the engineers. Are you an engineer Jimmy? I don't think so. Let's get the engineers to do when he lost
[2:56:57.080 --> 2:56:59.320]  So he edited it is what cowards do
[2:57:00.000 --> 2:57:03.920]  Join us again on the other shows a bmini on Twitter oz
[2:57:03.920 --> 2:57:13.640]  Thank you so much for the time and we really appreciate you standing up against the globalist
[2:57:14.320 --> 2:57:16.320]  Thanks for having me mate
[2:57:16.320 --> 2:57:18.320]  Now it's almost 5 a.m. Where he's at
[2:57:18.840 --> 2:57:23.240]  5 a.m. We're gonna come back take a few phone calls and then we're gonna go to break and then the one the only
[2:57:23.400 --> 2:57:26.440]  Dr. Nick baggage is coming in here loaded for bear. I
[2:57:27.080 --> 2:57:30.520]  May have to close for them for a while though because I didn't get into our little friend
[2:57:30.520 --> 2:57:33.560]  The lawsuit professor caught with a cans of gas
[2:57:34.400 --> 2:57:36.900]  Inside the big church
[2:57:37.600 --> 2:57:39.600]  St. Patrick's in New York
[2:57:39.720 --> 2:57:41.720]  Yes, a
[2:57:41.720 --> 2:57:43.720]  liberal philosophy professor
[2:57:44.600 --> 2:57:50.280]  If you're not expanding you're imploding there is no set stasis. There is no managed system
[2:57:50.280 --> 2:57:51.400]  There is no
[2:57:51.400 --> 2:57:54.640]  Uncontinuum the continuum is always launching forward in the future
[2:57:54.640 --> 2:58:00.360]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up. We won't just be here a hundred years. We'll be here forever
[2:58:00.360 --> 2:58:07.200]  We'll turn the whole thing around our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are gonna look back and say, you know
[2:58:07.200 --> 2:58:08.640]  That you when we struggled here
[2:58:08.640 --> 2:58:11.320]  We made it and that's really where this goes today
[2:58:11.320 --> 2:58:13.040]  God's got a big war for you ready
[2:58:13.040 --> 2:58:17.520]  And so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong
[2:58:17.520 --> 2:58:24.480]  Are you gonna really be able to face the other stuff because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are
[2:58:24.480 --> 2:58:28.040]  Also ready to fight you don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back
[2:58:28.040 --> 2:58:33.920]  And I mean, I don't know what's gonna happen to me in the future. I mean all I know is I want to go with the master built
[2:58:33.920 --> 2:58:39.640]  I want to go to the next level. I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced not these devil worshipers
[2:58:39.640 --> 2:58:44.480]  They're cold and failed and feels like being a tomb. I want life. I want Jesus

[2:59:40.800 --> 2:59:51.600]  Available at infowarstore.com You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:00:01.080 --> 3:00:05.480]  Welcome back Alex Jones here. I think back it's coming up. I think for your calls right now
[3:00:06.200 --> 3:00:08.200]  You know, it's incredible
[3:00:08.200 --> 3:00:11.280]  That CNN if you go to their website says
[3:00:12.040 --> 3:00:19.440]  Trump's obstruction failed when staffers defied him and they've got a bunch of blacked out staffers in the report
[3:00:21.640 --> 3:00:26.240]  Protecting the deep state not Trump Trump wanted the whole thing released unredacted
[3:00:27.840 --> 3:00:33.640]  So like I told you tomorrow's news today, I told you this weeks ago. They they claim they want it redacted
[3:00:33.640 --> 3:00:37.560]  So they have their cake and eat it too. They don't want it redacted
[3:00:38.240 --> 3:00:40.640]  Trump doesn't they want it redacted
[3:00:42.080 --> 3:00:44.720]  Because it's got all the evidence of their crimes in it
[3:00:45.680 --> 3:00:47.680]  so they failed big time and
[3:00:48.200 --> 3:00:50.200]  They bet all their marbles on this
[3:00:51.120 --> 3:00:53.120]  Everything they had on this. Where does this go?
[3:00:54.800 --> 3:00:57.280]  It's an insane time to be alive I can just tell you that right now
[3:00:57.640 --> 3:01:01.040]  And I don't expect the craze left back down. They're gonna get even crazier
[3:01:01.040 --> 3:01:09.080]  They're gonna fumble the mouth even more. We post that flashback Trump asked when trials for treason would begin for Dems involved in Russia
[3:01:09.080 --> 3:01:11.080]  Oaks the attempted coup
[3:01:12.720 --> 3:01:14.720]  Who's been holding the longest here
[3:01:20.800 --> 3:01:27.840]  Who's been holding the longest three five four farm I smell the blood of an Englishman
[3:01:27.840 --> 3:01:36.000]  Be you live or be dead? I'll grind his bones to make my bread. Let's go ahead and talk to Benny in New York Benny
[3:01:36.000 --> 3:01:38.000]  Thanks for holding
[3:01:38.440 --> 3:01:42.640]  Alex it is an honor to talk with you sir. I want to talk to you brother. Go ahead. I
[3:01:43.200 --> 3:01:48.920]  Just want to let you know I I pray for you and the folks at info wars every day
[3:01:49.560 --> 3:01:53.240]  Thank you, and you guys are in my prayers. I just wanted to talk quickly
[3:01:54.160 --> 3:01:55.360]  just
[3:01:55.360 --> 3:02:00.200]  Bring the Bible into it. It says in Ephesians that we are not fighting against flesh and blood enemies
[3:02:00.400 --> 3:02:06.000]  But against evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world Prince and Prince and principalities of the air
[3:02:07.240 --> 3:02:09.800]  Exactly, and I think there's more unseen
[3:02:10.240 --> 3:02:13.320]  Than seen and this is really truly a fight
[3:02:13.920 --> 3:02:20.160]  Good versus evil and when you shine the light of truth on deception because that's the enemy's main tactic deception
[3:02:20.480 --> 3:02:24.360]  When you shine the light of truth on deception truth will always win
[3:02:24.360 --> 3:02:28.920]  Always now I just want to encourage you to keep fighting the good fight
[3:02:29.040 --> 3:02:33.800]  You have Jesus on your side, and that's the strongest power in the universe
[3:02:33.800 --> 3:02:37.200]  I totally agree and the West has a great potential for evil
[3:02:37.200 --> 3:02:39.960]  But also a great potential to be particularly good
[3:02:40.080 --> 3:02:42.560]  That's why the globalists have gotten powers with the West
[3:02:42.640 --> 3:02:47.240]  But they seek to destroy it because they believe that has the keys to save the people free
[3:02:48.960 --> 3:02:51.120]  Exactly, and you know what we
[3:02:51.120 --> 3:02:57.920]  Do here and and what you do is shine that light into the world on that deception and
[3:02:58.800 --> 3:03:04.520]  You know the light shines in darkness and blazes the darkness away and you are setting people on fire brother
[3:03:04.600 --> 3:03:08.040]  You are too Benny, but that's how I feel constantly like I've got to expose this
[3:03:08.040 --> 3:03:12.640]  I've got to put light on this and I just believe the people will make the right decision once light on it
[3:03:14.080 --> 3:03:16.080]  Absolutely, I just want to encourage you man
[3:03:16.080 --> 3:03:21.800]  I encourage I'm encouraging you what do you think the Democrats and the globalists are going to do now and the Republican blue bloods
[3:03:21.880 --> 3:03:23.960]  But everything they try to blow up in their face
[3:03:25.120 --> 3:03:27.120]  Well like you said earlier
[3:03:27.600 --> 3:03:29.800]  Goodness, I didn't think they'd get any lower
[3:03:30.600 --> 3:03:37.600]  Promoting, you know killing babies and trying to say that you know, that's okay. I really think that's babies after they're born
[3:03:37.600 --> 3:03:39.600]  We keep them comfortable
[3:03:39.600 --> 3:03:46.120]  What that little flesh balls got a lot of money in them organs? I?
[3:03:47.160 --> 3:03:55.160]  Have to bite them I honestly do I think I think people are waking up and there's an incredible underground movement where people are being activated and
[3:03:55.480 --> 3:04:00.760]  No, it's massive all the bullying of the left and Cuomo celebrating. We're gonna kill babies if they're born
[3:04:05.040 --> 3:04:08.000]  It's all they're just showing off their evil right in front everybody
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:14.200]  Yeah, I think I think now that the light is on it more people are waking up and
[3:04:15.040 --> 3:04:22.640]  You know outlets like infowars and others are but Benny really we keep them comfortable
[3:04:27.560 --> 3:04:31.800]  And then we decide whether to resuscitate as the governor said
[3:04:31.800 --> 3:04:39.800]  The baby's alive, but they decide whether it has a right to live that's called resuscitation little magic trick that the governor does
[3:04:40.600 --> 3:04:44.120]  What he talks in a southern blue lovin voice, baby
[3:04:44.120 --> 3:04:49.160]  I appreciate your call coming up that a nick baggett stay with us news wars dot com
[3:04:53.880 --> 3:04:57.160]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners
[3:04:57.160 --> 3:05:01.640]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the deep earth crystals anymore 20 year and a half fight
[3:05:01.640 --> 3:05:08.480]  But we have the original producer the original crystal source the best atomic idea in the world x2 is back
[3:05:08.480 --> 3:05:11.880]  We got it. This deal just happened about a month ago. We rushed it into production
[3:05:12.160 --> 3:05:16.760]  It's been bottled the labels are being put on today, and then it's going to be on an 18 wheeler
[3:05:17.280 --> 3:05:22.400]  Right here to Austin from the plant in the Rockies and it's going to be shipped out to you
[3:05:22.400 --> 3:05:29.040]  Be sure to sign up for auto ship and an additional 10% off the 25% off celebration of the fact that we got it back
[3:05:29.040 --> 3:05:35.800]  And we're relaunching it research the iodine conspiracy find out why it's so important find out what the globalists don't want you to have
[3:05:36.160 --> 3:05:40.320]  The good halogen what you have the bad halogens at info wars store calm
[3:05:40.320 --> 3:05:46.040]  That's the umbrella site and for his life.com. She writes the supplements, and this is the king daddy
[3:05:46.040 --> 3:05:52.440]  Ladies and gentlemen it is x2 original now back at info or stored.com
[3:06:01.880 --> 3:06:07.640]  In the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence
[3:06:07.960 --> 3:06:11.920]  Whether sought or unsought by the military industrial
[3:06:11.920 --> 3:06:18.520]  Conflict in Dallas, Texas three shots were fired a president Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas
[3:06:18.680 --> 3:06:26.040]  The first report to say that president Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting. It is a big idea
[3:06:27.120 --> 3:06:29.120]  a new
[3:06:32.320 --> 3:06:35.760]  Almost it is we were planned to impose it just
[3:06:35.760 --> 3:06:43.040]  Hey, hey, either you're with us or you're with the terrorists
[3:06:43.040 --> 3:07:01.960]  I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in hands of soldiers not the hands of criminals
[3:07:01.960 --> 3:07:15.720]  For many of the police and guard troops it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city global governance
[3:07:15.720 --> 3:07:18.760]  It lasts is it one world the central bank is in charge
[3:07:18.760 --> 3:07:22.520]  But aren't we all just living and dying from what the central banks do?
[3:07:22.520 --> 3:07:33.440]  From the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[3:07:39.080 --> 3:07:43.480]  I do have the right to fight back and I'm fighting back not for me
[3:07:43.480 --> 3:07:52.040]  I'm fighting back for the people of this country was no collision. No collision. No collision. There is absolutely no collision
[3:07:52.040 --> 3:07:57.680]  There's no collision. The fact is there is no collision. No collision. There's no collision. This is a
[3:07:58.840 --> 3:08:00.080]  investigation where
[3:08:00.080 --> 3:08:07.360]  Many many millions of dollars has been spent and there's no collusion. This is ace a win for this president who
[3:08:07.880 --> 3:08:13.800]  For now two years has essentially been screaming. There was no Russia collusion. He is backed up by
[3:08:14.640 --> 3:08:19.720]  Muller maybe every time he said no collusion, but more than 231 times so far
[3:08:19.720 --> 3:08:24.400]  Maybe every time he said no collusion. He was telling the truth. This was an illegal
[3:08:25.160 --> 3:08:30.800]  Takedown that failed and hopefully somebody's gonna look at the other side
[3:08:30.800 --> 3:08:51.600]  I'm standing in this last hour for Alex and I'm down here in Austin, you know
[3:08:51.600 --> 3:08:56.720]  And this is actually the first time I've been in studio as as the host and I appreciate that
[3:08:56.720 --> 3:09:00.680]  A couple things I want to say, you know, every time I come down here
[3:09:00.680 --> 3:09:07.000]  I'm totally impressed with the team and and all of you watching this broadcast listening to this broadcast today are
[3:09:07.400 --> 3:09:10.160]  A part of that team and and we so much
[3:09:11.000 --> 3:09:13.000]  Appreciate you couldn't do it without you
[3:09:13.200 --> 3:09:15.440]  The last caller in that last segment
[3:09:16.080 --> 3:09:21.320]  Mentioned that that he always prays for this network and I would say that's the first contribution everyone can make
[3:09:21.320 --> 3:09:28.920]  Hold Alex up hold the team up here all of them up here in prayer as a starting point
[3:09:28.920 --> 3:09:31.360]  I think that gets us closer to the mark
[3:09:31.640 --> 3:09:37.240]  It also calms the spirit allows us to focus and keep our focus and stay on our message
[3:09:37.240 --> 3:09:40.680]  And we need your support to do that. We need your continued support to do that
[3:09:41.160 --> 3:09:43.920]  As Alex says it's always a 360 wins. So
[3:09:44.920 --> 3:09:47.840]  participate check the info wars store and
[3:09:47.840 --> 3:09:54.440]  And support us in that way. It's a great thing to be doing. I want to talk a little bit about the context of
[3:09:55.200 --> 3:10:00.320]  The Mula report and what's been going on here. You know, this has been a two-year
[3:10:01.400 --> 3:10:02.840]  witch hunt
[3:10:02.840 --> 3:10:07.880]  The collusion delusion has been going on for way way too long
[3:10:08.280 --> 3:10:14.800]  But I want to kind of roll back to a couple of historic points that really remind me of the place
[3:10:14.800 --> 3:10:17.920]  We sit today and I want to I want to go back
[3:10:18.640 --> 3:10:22.080]  To the Nix administration and the Watergate era and at that time
[3:10:22.600 --> 3:10:25.920]  If you remember the break-in in the Watergate was
[3:10:26.680 --> 3:10:27.800]  X
[3:10:27.800 --> 3:10:29.800]  CIA officials, right?
[3:10:30.160 --> 3:10:35.200]  Well later we found out that that wasn't the case that the CIA was being routinely used
[3:10:36.040 --> 3:10:40.720]  Domestically to open people's mail to tap their phones to infiltrate various organizations
[3:10:40.720 --> 3:10:44.040]  That the Nix administration opposed
[3:10:44.840 --> 3:10:47.520]  Essentially, they used the apparatus of government then
[3:10:48.520 --> 3:10:49.960]  They got caught
[3:10:49.960 --> 3:10:55.800]  Unfortunately, we never got the whole story and I want to kind of go back because this is a time that my dad was in the Congress
[3:10:57.520 --> 3:11:02.320]  Michael Bell was a US senator from Alaska. He's the one that released the Pentagon Papers
[3:11:02.320 --> 3:11:08.440]  Many will remember that that started a huge controversy with the New York Times and began to set the precedence about
[3:11:08.440 --> 3:11:12.360]  How do you release information? What is the obligation of the press?
[3:11:13.000 --> 3:11:17.040]  This was a really really important time and then there was a presidential report
[3:11:17.640 --> 3:11:23.400]  Completed in June 2000 or excuse me 1976 and this and this report
[3:11:24.560 --> 3:11:26.360]  Talks about
[3:11:26.360 --> 3:11:31.320]  the abuses of the CIA all of the things that that I just mentioned and
[3:11:32.120 --> 3:11:36.120]  The mind control technologies that were me being advanced now now
[3:11:36.120 --> 3:11:41.320]  We're talking about a lot of years ago over 35 almost 40 years ago and
[3:11:42.600 --> 3:11:47.600]  Today what we see is sort of a repeat of that scenario
[3:11:47.600 --> 3:11:51.800]  But I want to roll back to another turning point in American history and that was
[3:11:52.480 --> 3:11:57.880]  If you remember the election where Ross Perot was running very important election
[3:11:58.240 --> 3:12:05.960]  At that time there was a lot of independent broadcasting going on in the political arena and one of the big broadcasters in those days now
[3:12:05.960 --> 3:12:09.840]  deceased was Chuck Carter and Chuck Carter. I think had about a thousand
[3:12:11.480 --> 3:12:19.160]  Stations in his network had a big big impact on Ross Perot and bringing him forward because it was a unity of the independent media
[3:12:19.480 --> 3:12:25.240]  At that time and a Maverick candidate. He was just before his time and unfortunately
[3:12:26.040 --> 3:12:31.680]  We saw what happened, you know, they first attacked him. They couldn't penetrate the guy. He was just too strong
[3:12:32.520 --> 3:12:34.520]  character, they then attacked his family
[3:12:34.520 --> 3:12:41.240]  That weakened him he backed off if you remember he withdrew from the race and then jumped back in but that was sort of the beginning of
[3:12:41.240 --> 3:12:42.240]  the end
[3:12:42.240 --> 3:12:49.160]  When I look at what's happening in the current frame, it's it's really the same scenario repeating again
[3:12:49.160 --> 3:12:52.440]  Now here we have the Maverick who gets elected
[3:12:53.560 --> 3:13:01.320]  Donald Trump and you look at Donald Trump's record. I've never seen or heard about a president being hammered so thoroughly daily
[3:13:01.320 --> 3:13:06.920]  By all of the mainstream media and still managed to get so much done
[3:13:06.920 --> 3:13:11.480]  I mean the number of accomplishments in 500 days is off the charts
[3:13:11.960 --> 3:13:19.040]  Unprecedented and yet they just can't let anything go and and they're not going to the Democrats don't do that
[3:13:19.040 --> 3:13:24.520]  They're going to continue to look for things to hammer whatever issues and even invent them. I mean Pelosi
[3:13:25.080 --> 3:13:29.040]  The inventor of bad news and then they spin it out to the press
[3:13:29.040 --> 3:13:33.960]  as as leaked information the press reports it and then as
[3:13:34.760 --> 3:13:36.960]  Pelosi says they repackage it
[3:13:37.640 --> 3:13:42.760]  Reorganize it and then they punch it back out as if it's factual. This is how they operate
[3:13:42.760 --> 3:13:50.240]  This is what we've been seeing and they create emotional responses that they they can move people like a herd of animals towards their
[3:13:50.800 --> 3:13:57.720]  Objectives we're not that herd of animals. We have the spark of divinity within us and and because of that
[3:13:57.720 --> 3:14:02.840]  We can find a way to remain calm to see a
[3:14:03.880 --> 3:14:05.880]  different way through the
[3:14:06.360 --> 3:14:13.120]  Through the fog of all of it, you know and and what takes us through the fog or the facts is the real information the data
[3:14:13.960 --> 3:14:21.080]  The information that gives credibility to what we say because that's what matters the facts are what matters
[3:14:21.080 --> 3:14:27.760]  The emotion should push those facts certainly, but not the other way around and this is what we're seeing
[3:14:28.280 --> 3:14:32.240]  so much of the Democratic Party when we think about
[3:14:33.080 --> 3:14:38.800]  Whistleblowing as a concept and how that plays into all of this if it hadn't been
[3:14:39.440 --> 3:14:46.840]  For whistleblowers the deep throats of Watergate would we have ever known the truth if it had if it had not been
[3:14:46.840 --> 3:14:53.000]  For people stepping up and having the courage of their convictions. Would we know the truth about anything?
[3:14:53.320 --> 3:14:58.320]  Do we want a lukewarm media or do we want a media that's hot that?
[3:14:58.640 --> 3:15:05.440]  Spicy that gets into the meat that goes up against the edge of those issues and brings them into us to make those
[3:15:05.800 --> 3:15:12.200]  Determinations of what those facts mean what we see in the mainstream is the most editorialized
[3:15:12.200 --> 3:15:18.600]  Non-sense that you've ever seen, you know, I've worked in all of the studios here
[3:15:19.120 --> 3:15:22.520]  At info wars and you know, there's no teleprompters in any of these studios

[3:20:09.920 --> 3:20:11.920]  Live from Austin, Texas
[3:20:12.760 --> 3:20:14.560]  Broadcasting worldwide
[3:20:14.560 --> 3:20:20.560]  It's Alex Jones and now your host Nick baggage
[3:20:25.480 --> 3:20:33.160]  And welcome back to info wars and this is a Nick Vegas sitting in for Alex and this fourth hour down here in Austin
[3:20:33.160 --> 3:20:37.800]  And it's great to be here with the team, you know just before the break. I was talking about the
[3:20:38.720 --> 3:20:40.720]  bit of Pelosi's
[3:20:40.720 --> 3:20:49.240]  Program and how the party the Democratic Party actually pushes the agendas and creates and makes up agendas
[3:20:49.240 --> 3:20:53.640]  And if we've got that clip we can roll that and I really want people to see this again
[3:20:55.240 --> 3:20:57.520]  Brings it all home. Do we have that guys?
[3:20:59.600 --> 3:21:02.200]  Maybe not there she is
[3:21:03.200 --> 3:21:08.560]  The wrap-up smear if you want to talk politics call the wrap-up smear you smear somebody
[3:21:08.560 --> 3:21:13.360]  With falsehoods and all the rest and then you merchandise
[3:21:13.360 --> 3:21:19.760]  And then you write it and I say see it's reported in the press that this this this and this
[3:21:20.360 --> 3:21:26.680]  So they have that validation that the press reported the smear and then it's called the wrap-up smear now
[3:21:26.680 --> 3:21:30.680]  I'm going to merchandise the presses report on the smear that we made
[3:21:31.120 --> 3:21:33.120]  Now listen to that
[3:21:33.120 --> 3:21:40.000]  Isn't that what we just saw for the last couple years the manufacturing of news and then the reporting of news as if it's real
[3:21:40.680 --> 3:21:47.120]  This is what they've been doing ladies and gentlemen and this agenda will continue because that's the leadership of the United States House
[3:21:47.440 --> 3:21:53.680]  How to lie to the public and yeah, I'm outraged by that because this is not the integrity of our government
[3:21:53.680 --> 3:22:00.640]  This is the one of the three branches of government whose values have been gutted by leadership like this
[3:22:00.640 --> 3:22:04.440]  This is the leadership that's taking this country
[3:22:04.680 --> 3:22:10.320]  Right down the drain and we need to finish the job of draining the swamp
[3:22:11.000 --> 3:22:17.160]  Donald Trump is out there doing his thing today knowing the collusion delusion is over and the
[3:22:17.720 --> 3:22:24.840]  Manufacturing of media news is over. They are the fake news look at CNN today. They got ratings lower
[3:22:24.840 --> 3:22:34.080]  Than the hallmark channel for goodness sake CNN is right where they belong headed down the drain with the rest of the swamp
[3:22:34.440 --> 3:22:38.680]  That's what's going on. I mean we have a majority leader and it's about lying
[3:22:39.320 --> 3:22:47.560]  Telling their party how to lie to the public and then we've watched it unfold disrupt this entire country and slow an agenda
[3:22:47.560 --> 3:22:52.280]  That's actually making progress which has taken the country back getting back the Republic
[3:22:52.280 --> 3:22:58.880]  Whistle blowing is a major piece of that info wars has been blowing the whistle for over 23 years
[3:22:59.480 --> 3:23:05.920]  That's what this network is about a couple years ago when Alex was going through some of his tough times
[3:23:05.920 --> 3:23:10.720]  I came down for the first time to meet Alex in person because we worked all these years together
[3:23:10.720 --> 3:23:16.200]  But always over the phone and I doubled down on this network two years ago because
[3:23:16.200 --> 3:23:24.120]  These are the guys that stay with it being hammered on being nailed every time
[3:23:24.120 --> 3:23:31.040]  They get a chance in New York Times printing this kind of raggy shoddy journalism to attack a network
[3:23:31.200 --> 3:23:36.800]  That is the tip of the spear by the fact that people listen people work with us
[3:23:37.040 --> 3:23:42.600]  They bring information into us, you know, you guys are some of the best researchers in the world
[3:23:42.600 --> 3:23:48.400]  Independent research is what it's all about and and that's what the network has always been about
[3:23:48.920 --> 3:23:50.760]  Whistle blowing. What is whistle blowing?
[3:23:50.760 --> 3:23:57.200]  It's identifying something that you believe that the world needs to see that you believe that we need to know about and
[3:23:57.240 --> 3:24:01.160]  The courage it takes to do this, you know two days. I mentioned this earlier
[3:24:03.240 --> 3:24:06.240]  Two days on David night show I mentioned two days ago
[3:24:06.880 --> 3:24:12.000]  The Europe the European Parliament, you know that unelected body. They passed a whistleblower law
[3:24:12.000 --> 3:24:19.280]  A couple days after they drag a sage out of the embassy then they pass a law to protect guys like him
[3:24:20.080 --> 3:24:25.400]  Wow, isn't that convenient and it passed, you know, I mean not by a small majority
[3:24:25.400 --> 3:24:33.400]  There are 500 and I believe 520 members of the European Parliament 29 knows 21 abstentions arrest were in favor across all political boundaries
[3:24:34.760 --> 3:24:39.640]  Transparency even an unelected group recognizes the value of transparency
[3:24:39.640 --> 3:24:47.480]  That's what's missing here whistleblowing is fundamental and the one thing I would say is they went a little bit further than we have in the U.S
[3:24:47.480 --> 3:24:53.680]  They applied the whistleblowing laws to private sector, you know the FOIA the freedom of information Act requests
[3:24:53.680 --> 3:25:00.840]  Which grew out of Watergate grew out of that era does not address private companies and this is one of the biggest
[3:25:00.840 --> 3:25:09.400]  Holes in FOIA is it has to apply to the private sector when they have government contracts because it's your money
[3:25:10.400 --> 3:25:12.800]  They need to be accountable. It's your money
[3:25:12.800 --> 3:25:20.000]  It's what it's what we're paying for and we have a right to access whistleblowing needs to extend to every government
[3:25:20.760 --> 3:25:28.400]  Contractor whistleblowers need to be protected. They need to be insulated, you know that guy that blew the whistle on the Luxemburg
[3:25:28.400 --> 3:25:36.440]  Luxemburg thefts, you know where they were using bank manipulation to cheat and steal and hide from taxes a guy
[3:25:36.440 --> 3:25:38.200]  Who blew the whistle on that?
[3:25:38.200 --> 3:25:43.640]  They tried to put him in jail forget about the people break in the law. They try to put him in jail
[3:25:43.640 --> 3:25:51.040]  He spent 60,000 euros almost 80,000 dollars to defend himself for doing the right thing
[3:25:51.600 --> 3:25:53.600]  That's what's going on right now in this network
[3:25:53.600 --> 3:25:59.560]  Trying to defend doing the right thing and we need your help to keep doing that
[3:25:59.560 --> 3:26:04.080]  You know, this is not an easy thing what Alex is going through every day and what this team goes through every day
[3:26:04.560 --> 3:26:12.360]  But we are winning the info wars. We are winning those wars today was another victory for truth
[3:26:12.880 --> 3:26:17.240]  We see the Muller report collapse and all those redoubted sections
[3:26:17.240 --> 3:26:22.040]  I am betting dollars to doughnuts that they're not about Republicans
[3:26:22.040 --> 3:26:28.920]  They're about Democrats. They're about treason. They're about undermining a president using false
[3:26:29.640 --> 3:26:34.600]  dossiers and secret courts to interfere with a presidential campaign
[3:26:35.360 --> 3:26:39.920]  Give me a break. It wasn't Russian collusion
[3:26:40.440 --> 3:26:43.040]  It was Democratic collusion to corrupt
[3:26:43.880 --> 3:26:50.480]  This Democratic Republic's process of elections using the apparatus of government against candidates
[3:26:50.480 --> 3:26:53.840]  This is fundamentally wrong. This is fundamentally flawed
[3:26:54.520 --> 3:27:03.080]  And it's something that all of us have to take stock in today as we see the Democrats unfold their next pile of nonsense
[3:27:04.000 --> 3:27:10.720]  I'm betting it's going to be they're going to continue to dig for tax records or something to show that Donald Trump has somehow
[3:27:11.200 --> 3:27:15.560]  Abused the tax code. I can tell you if you abuse the tax code. They had already caught up with him
[3:27:15.560 --> 3:27:22.200]  He used the tax code like everybody else does and he actually tried to reform it in a way
[3:27:22.200 --> 3:27:27.200]  That I don't know necessarily benefits him completely. I mean his foreign income is now being taxed too
[3:27:27.960 --> 3:27:32.440]  He did the right thing for America by taxing foreign corporations
[3:27:32.840 --> 3:27:36.040]  Operating out of the base of a lot of the US protection
[3:27:36.520 --> 3:27:42.560]  This is a big step in the right direction to you know, you're taxed on your worldwide income no matter where you go
[3:27:42.560 --> 3:27:46.240]  US corporations are taxed at the discount rate now

[3:31:53.480 --> 3:31:57.040]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube
[3:31:57.600 --> 3:32:06.120]  Censorship and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored the most buried the most suppressed
[3:32:06.840 --> 3:32:10.100]  And that's the videos where you saw in
[3:32:10.100 --> 3:32:13.060]  2016 election night all the arrogant
[3:32:13.620 --> 3:32:18.380]  Leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt-hurt when Trump won
[3:32:19.340 --> 3:32:24.300]  They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to remember what political action did
[3:32:25.220 --> 3:32:29.420]  And that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut in fours down
[3:32:29.660 --> 3:32:32.500]  This is a fight about taking your speech away
[3:32:32.700 --> 3:32:37.820]  Not just my speech about taking your very sovereignty away. This country is in a war

[3:33:09.220 --> 3:33:11.220]  Nick baggage
[3:33:12.420 --> 3:33:21.060]  And welcome back to infowar store. You're listening to the alex jones, so with nick baggage
[3:33:21.060 --> 3:33:22.860]  And
[3:33:22.860 --> 3:33:26.980]  Welcome back to info wars and I'm really pleased to be here today
[3:33:26.980 --> 3:33:32.140]  I'm gonna take a few calls and get folks a chance to weigh in on some of this stuff and Greg
[3:33:32.140 --> 3:33:37.020]  You've been holding forever in California. If you're still with us come on up and what do you want to say?
[3:33:38.260 --> 3:33:40.580]  First I wanted to do a quick plug for bodies
[3:33:41.060 --> 3:33:45.940]  My dad's got chronic pancreatitis and it really helps with his inflammation
[3:33:45.940 --> 3:33:52.220]  And allows him to kind of keep a a steady diet. I know it helps with inflammation and stuff
[3:33:52.980 --> 3:33:54.900]  but to my point for
[3:33:54.900 --> 3:33:56.900]  the Muller report
[3:33:58.060 --> 3:34:01.500]  With the the Democrats calling to have it released
[3:34:02.500 --> 3:34:04.500]  I'm worried that bar is
[3:34:05.140 --> 3:34:07.380]  Going to either not release it at all
[3:34:08.220 --> 3:34:13.420]  Or if he does it's going to be highly redacted and it's going to really play into the Democrats hands
[3:34:13.420 --> 3:34:18.420]  And they'll be able to kind of say that he's been co-opted by Trump
[3:34:19.620 --> 3:34:26.420]  Right. I you know I watched the press conference earlier and then the Q&A's afterwards and some of this was was brought up
[3:34:26.420 --> 3:34:31.300]  And there's actually going to be a version of this that is pretty much not redacted
[3:34:31.300 --> 3:34:33.420]  That's going to be given to the leadership of both parties
[3:34:33.940 --> 3:34:40.140]  The things that will be redacted as I understand it are going to be the things are still before the grand jury because you can't release
[3:34:40.140 --> 3:34:43.380]  That information until the grand jury makes their determinations
[3:34:43.860 --> 3:34:49.940]  I think that's going to happen. It's going to happen in a couple of stages. They have something generally for the Congress
[3:34:49.940 --> 3:34:54.740]  That's less redacted something that's specific. That's pretty much unredacted except for those
[3:34:55.460 --> 3:35:00.220]  Particular areas dealing with with the court, but great. That's a great point. I think we ought to pay attention
[3:35:00.980 --> 3:35:06.300]  And watch how it actually rolls out and and I think that was a great question. Great. Thank you very much for your comment
[3:35:06.300 --> 3:35:10.140]  I've got Chris holding in Minneapolis. Chris are you there?
[3:35:11.980 --> 3:35:17.100]  Hello, Dr. Baggots, can you hear me? I sure can go ahead. Hi, sir
[3:35:17.100 --> 3:35:22.180]  I was holding for a long time too, and then I got cut off, but I'm glad I got you back
[3:35:23.700 --> 3:35:30.380]  A lot of things I shout out on the products as well alpha male and male vitality
[3:35:30.380 --> 3:35:36.740]  Brainforce I've been taking them since since Christmas. They are tremendous great. Thank you for that
[3:35:38.860 --> 3:35:45.380]  Doctor do you think I a lot I could ask you to but touch on answer two questions. I'll hang up
[3:35:47.220 --> 3:35:54.380]  Number one are optics. You hear this word optics out there. Do you think that is part of a
[3:35:54.380 --> 3:36:00.580]  Plan by the president and the people working with them to they're trying to gently
[3:36:01.100 --> 3:36:08.260]  Ease the American public towards this. I mean, I I'm happy with some of the steps. We've seen cake and obviously the
[3:36:09.260 --> 3:36:10.940]  report
[3:36:10.940 --> 3:36:12.940]  Dismissing the collusion is huge
[3:36:13.460 --> 3:36:15.460]  but do you think the
[3:36:16.220 --> 3:36:20.940]  Administration is ready to take the gloves off and start really
[3:36:20.940 --> 3:36:26.940]  Going after the truth getting the truth out there about the real criminals
[3:36:26.940 --> 3:36:33.420]  And then this is for a guy like you this last question if you can touch on it is for a guy with your experience
[3:36:33.740 --> 3:36:36.460]  And you know what you've been in this for a long time
[3:36:37.540 --> 3:36:40.660]  So one thing that worries about me living in Minneapolis and the
[3:36:41.420 --> 3:36:43.940]  Islamization of certain parts of Minnesota and
[3:36:43.940 --> 3:36:52.020]  The world do you see the Albert Pike world war or a free world war plan still in play?
[3:36:52.500 --> 3:36:58.060]  You're I'm sure you're familiar with that. Yeah, you know, I appreciate appreciate the call Chris
[3:36:58.060 --> 3:37:02.820]  Thank you very much. Let me let me talk about the two issues. One was the optics and the gloves off
[3:37:02.820 --> 3:37:08.360]  I think the gloves are off. I think this show is about to come into a whole new frame of reference
[3:37:08.360 --> 3:37:15.080]  You know when you use the government to further political ends in the way that this has been done from the
[3:37:15.600 --> 3:37:19.120]  Obama administrations and and the Clinton's involvement and all of that
[3:37:19.600 --> 3:37:24.320]  This is the the stuff that needs to be shown. This is where as ugly as it might be
[3:37:24.320 --> 3:37:29.320]  We need to see the truth and this is why we need to let the grand juries finish what they're doing
[3:37:30.040 --> 3:37:32.040]  See what comes out of that
[3:37:32.040 --> 3:37:39.240]  But I also think we need to go roll back in time and start approaching that false false dossier from the very beginning
[3:37:39.240 --> 3:37:45.740]  And I think the optics are the truth stick to the truth stick to the facts and let's draw those facts out
[3:37:45.960 --> 3:37:49.640]  You know, the other issue about just what's happening in terms of
[3:37:51.040 --> 3:37:55.800]  Minneapolis and the number of immigrants coming into Minneapolis. Yeah, I'm familiar with that
[3:37:55.800 --> 3:37:58.520]  I used to have a small warehouse just north of you and O'Namia
[3:37:58.520 --> 3:38:05.400]  I'm just just shut it down here this last summer, but I was in and out of Minneapolis a lot of family in Minnesota
[3:38:05.720 --> 3:38:07.720]  It has changed quite a bit
[3:38:08.240 --> 3:38:09.640]  Minnesota's
[3:38:09.640 --> 3:38:15.100]  Was relatively a liberal state got a little more conserved is kind of drifting back the other direction now
[3:38:16.800 --> 3:38:18.400]  You know
[3:38:18.400 --> 3:38:25.280]  Whenever my family immigrated from Croatia to Minnesota and it was a very different world
[3:38:25.280 --> 3:38:31.960]  In those days you integrated you became part of a country that you came to believe in that's why you came here
[3:38:31.960 --> 3:38:38.960]  I would hope that those assimilating in our country today who are coming in the front door are coming with the
[3:38:39.360 --> 3:38:42.960]  Expectation that they're coming into a culture not transferring one
[3:38:43.560 --> 3:38:47.120]  And I think that's really what it's about. It's about developing a culture
[3:38:48.040 --> 3:38:53.800]  That is American that is unique and that's what we've been doing here. We don't need that under undermined
[3:38:53.800 --> 3:39:00.480]  There's the globalist view as a false view for this age and that's what I would say about it
[3:39:00.480 --> 3:39:07.320]  I've got Brandon holding in Texas Brandon. Go ahead and make your pointer or ask your question
[3:39:07.320 --> 3:39:09.320]  I appreciate your call. Thanks, Dr. Nick for taking my call
[3:39:10.800 --> 3:39:13.920]  Just real quick a quick product plug
[3:39:14.680 --> 3:39:20.360]  For everybody listening out there if you just filter the fluoride out of your water and get some survival shield x2
[3:39:20.360 --> 3:39:26.960]  That alone will just wake you up and clear all the cobwebs out. You can see all this stuff real clearly at that point
[3:39:27.840 --> 3:39:34.240]  Secondly, I have something to comment on this if you like but if the president is listening and everybody out there
[3:39:35.720 --> 3:39:39.640]  If President Trump would repeal
[3:39:41.080 --> 3:39:44.880]  a countering disinformation and propaganda act that went into law in
[3:39:45.320 --> 3:39:46.800]  2016
[3:39:46.800 --> 3:39:50.920]  I really think as we talk about the court of public opinion, right?
[3:39:51.520 --> 3:39:56.600]  Well, as long as the news and now this news show the good fight, if you heard of this good fight
[3:39:56.600 --> 3:40:03.280]  As long as this stuff can legally be put out by the MSM, we're going to continue to see a divided
[3:40:03.800 --> 3:40:09.720]  Public I think the I think the president need to repeal the countering disinformation and propaganda act
[3:40:09.720 --> 3:40:13.800]  What do you think? I think that's that's an excellent point Brandon. Thank you for the call
[3:40:13.800 --> 3:40:17.360]  You know the the the whole idea that the government is funding it
[3:40:17.360 --> 3:40:20.960]  I think they've actually tried to slip it into the the defense budget right now
[3:40:21.360 --> 3:40:24.520]  But it's something that people can do something about this, you know
[3:40:24.520 --> 3:40:30.320]  I'll tell you what the simple answer on this is give a call to your senator or congressman
[3:40:30.320 --> 3:40:35.160]  I'm going to give you their phone number and it's going to be the switchboard for the Capitol and everyone listening can pick up
[3:40:35.160 --> 3:40:40.160]  The phone and weigh in on this report tell your senator tell your congressman what you think
[3:40:40.160 --> 3:40:45.160]  On any issue, but you should do it regularly and I'm going to give that number. It is 202
[3:40:46.000 --> 3:40:53.120]  224 312 and that's the Capitol Building switchboard in Washington, DC gets to every US senator every congressman
[3:40:53.120 --> 3:40:58.560]  I'm going to give it again really slowly. So make a note and make the call when you're done listening to the broadcast today
[3:40:59.560 --> 3:41:00.760]  202
[3:41:00.760 --> 3:41:02.520]  224
[3:41:02.520 --> 3:41:04.520]  3121
[3:41:04.520 --> 3:41:12.120]  202 224 312 and that gets you the Capitol Building that gets you direct access to your congressman your US senator
[3:41:12.320 --> 3:41:15.320]  tie the phone lines up today and
[3:41:15.560 --> 3:41:22.000]  weigh in on a few of these issues weigh in on support for the Mueller report weigh in supporting
[3:41:22.520 --> 3:41:24.520]  an amnesty
[3:41:24.800 --> 3:41:27.160]  pardon for a sage right now. I mean
[3:41:27.960 --> 3:41:33.200]  Take your issues that are important to you and put them in front of your senator and congressman
[3:41:33.200 --> 3:41:39.200]  Let him know you're paying attention. Let him know you're listening that makes a difference those watching the switchboard
[3:41:39.200 --> 3:41:43.320]  The phone number is on is pulled right off of the web, right? I mean
[3:41:43.880 --> 3:41:45.880]  Let's do something today
[3:41:46.040 --> 3:41:52.800]  Become part of the team by taking an action, you know, there's simple things we can all do we can all talk to our neighbors
[3:41:52.960 --> 3:41:55.400]  We can all write letters to the editor
[3:41:55.400 --> 3:41:57.880]  We can pick up the phone and call our congressman
[3:41:57.880 --> 3:42:03.760]  These are real things that add up that make a difference and we can all make a difference
[3:42:03.760 --> 3:42:10.280]  We can all become part of the info wars by taking small steps that we know we can take and be successful at
[3:42:10.280 --> 3:42:13.560]  That's all it requires a little bit of trying a little bit of effort
[3:42:13.560 --> 3:42:20.680]  I want to I want to talk about a couple of points. We're headed into the break. We're gonna have a another segment coming up
[3:42:20.680 --> 3:42:24.560]  I've got a few more callers and I want to talk about a way of maybe
[3:42:24.560 --> 3:42:32.320]  Be reframing the debate. Let's make the debate about a better place a better government a better America
[3:42:32.440 --> 3:42:35.980]  Let's do make America great again

[3:47:37.240 --> 3:47:42.180]  I've got to take a e-frog from Alaska. I know there's a lot of people holding. We're not ignoring you
[3:47:42.400 --> 3:47:46.880]  We'll try and get to you if I want to take at least someone from Alaska's calling in today
[3:47:46.880 --> 3:47:48.880]  I got to take the call
[3:47:48.880 --> 3:47:53.080]  Hey, thank you so much for taking my call doctor baggage
[3:47:54.040 --> 3:47:57.840]  So I got a story tell you yesterday. I was listening to info wars and
[3:47:59.080 --> 3:48:00.200]  I
[3:48:00.200 --> 3:48:05.320]  I was at work and I come back from a deliberate adover pieces and
[3:48:06.720 --> 3:48:13.000]  They tell me I can't listen to work is political and this is coming from two veterans
[3:48:14.000 --> 3:48:15.400]  for normal
[3:48:15.400 --> 3:48:22.000]  Yeah, wow really sorry to hear that. Oh, yeah, so I kind of freaked out on my and I said
[3:48:22.000 --> 3:48:24.000]  Why did you even go to war for me?
[3:48:24.080 --> 3:48:26.080]  If you're gonna suppress my freedom of speech
[3:48:27.120 --> 3:48:33.120]  Yeah, and my black my boss and he's just like come on man. He's doing a favor. Just tone it down around this one guy
[3:48:33.160 --> 3:48:35.160]  It's just one guy
[3:48:35.320 --> 3:48:41.320]  That was a problem with it. Well, it all started it all started out. I spread out telling them
[3:48:41.320 --> 3:48:47.240]  Do you know how organic milk is made and why why are why they call food organic?
[3:48:47.240 --> 3:48:50.360]  And do you know the difference and he just he told me to shut up
[3:48:50.920 --> 3:48:55.240]  Hey, he frog. I appreciate the call. You know, it's unfortunate. We see more of this again
[3:48:55.240 --> 3:49:01.400]  It's a political correctness mindset of the world today and it's so unfortunate. You know, I remember
[3:49:02.200 --> 3:49:07.020]  When I was working in in the cubicle world, you know, at least I could listen to the radio
[3:49:07.020 --> 3:49:12.460]  You know in the background and we always had talk radio in the background, you know
[3:49:12.460 --> 3:49:16.380]  And it's too bad that people are so afraid of words
[3:49:16.900 --> 3:49:19.740]  So afraid of the truth so afraid
[3:49:20.540 --> 3:49:26.220]  To meet themselves and actually challenge the ideas of others and you know, I appreciate it
[3:49:26.220 --> 3:49:31.940]  He is your employer. Unfortunately, they can regulate a certain aspect of your of your working environments. Just the way it goes
[3:49:31.940 --> 3:49:39.420]  But hey, when you walk out that door and switch off that light, you know, you're your own person again
[3:49:39.420 --> 3:49:42.940]  You can say whatever you like and and I appreciate that, you know
[3:49:42.940 --> 3:49:46.020]  I want to talk about four basic principles of
[3:49:47.060 --> 3:49:51.860]  Communication that might be useful and this actually comes from toll tech tradition, which is kind of awkward
[3:49:51.860 --> 3:49:56.980]  but they're really good points and one of them the first point the first principle is
[3:49:57.660 --> 3:50:00.580]  integrity with your speech what you say
[3:50:00.580 --> 3:50:07.100]  Be truthful, you know, it's truthful as you know and when you learn something that you know
[3:50:07.100 --> 3:50:12.740]  You maybe had to learn from go back and clean it up, but be truthful integrity the first principle
[3:50:13.140 --> 3:50:18.100]  The second principle is one we we all have the bad habit of doing and it's making assumptions
[3:50:19.220 --> 3:50:27.740]  Don't make assumptions listen very carefully a lot of times the assumptions that we make truly are way off the mark
[3:50:27.740 --> 3:50:34.340]  So second principle don't make assumptions go back to the first integrity in your speech
[3:50:34.660 --> 3:50:40.740]  second one don't make some assumptions and the third one in this is really tough for all of us
[3:50:40.740 --> 3:50:47.180]  It's don't take it personally, you know, even Christ hanging on the cross said
[3:50:47.740 --> 3:50:54.580]  Father and they know not what they do. All right. I mean think about that as the prime example of
[3:50:55.140 --> 3:50:57.140]  letting it go of
[3:50:57.140 --> 3:51:00.220]  Forgiveness even before the offense is complete
[3:51:00.980 --> 3:51:08.000]  This is an important point because as we take it personally we become very defensive and then we become defending our ego and our
[3:51:08.340 --> 3:51:13.860]  Personality instead of dealing with the issues that are important to us stay on the point
[3:51:14.340 --> 3:51:18.800]  Yeah, they're gonna attack you you're gonna have to defend a little bit, but then let it go
[3:51:18.800 --> 3:51:20.800]  I heard a
[3:51:20.800 --> 3:51:27.760]  Caitlyn Bennett saying this the other day she was yeah, I take the first couple of hits and respond, but then let it go and get back on message
[3:51:28.200 --> 3:51:34.040]  What a great thing coming out of such a young voice because this is a voice of experience
[3:51:34.680 --> 3:51:40.560]  Don't fall into the trap of being on the defensive stay on the offensive
[3:51:40.560 --> 3:51:46.040]  So remember the points first point integrity second point don't make assumptions third point
[3:51:46.040 --> 3:51:52.080]  Don't take it personally and the fourth and most important point is keep trying don't give up
[3:51:52.680 --> 3:51:57.160]  Honest effort keep trying if you give up. What good is it?
[3:51:57.880 --> 3:52:03.320]  Trying you make mistakes you fall down dust yourself off pick yourself up
[3:52:03.600 --> 3:52:07.960]  Lean into your brothers and sisters who are in the fight with you and step into it again
[3:52:08.760 --> 3:52:10.760]  with the integrity of
[3:52:10.760 --> 3:52:16.640]  Honest voice true speech first principle don't make assumptions second principle
[3:52:16.840 --> 3:52:23.840]  Don't take it personally third principle and try your very best and that doesn't mean that you're not gonna fail
[3:52:23.840 --> 3:52:25.840]  You're gonna fail from time to time
[3:52:25.920 --> 3:52:32.560]  Learn from it grow from it and advance from it. Those are the big principles in getting things done
[3:52:32.800 --> 3:52:36.600]  I've got a few callers still holding on. I got quite a few actually
[3:52:36.600 --> 3:52:42.200]  I've got Corey Victor Paul and a bunch of others standing by I'm gonna go ahead and take a couple more calls
[3:52:42.200 --> 3:52:47.960]  Because we got the time for it and I really want to get into that a little bit Corey in California. You've been hanging out for a while
[3:52:47.960 --> 3:52:49.400]  What do you got to say?
[3:52:49.400 --> 3:52:52.520]  Hello, Dr. Nick baggage. It's really nice to talk to you sir
[3:52:52.520 --> 3:52:57.120]  I've listened to you since you know a lot since you've been on info wars and
[3:52:57.560 --> 3:53:00.400]  your your your website and and
[3:53:01.440 --> 3:53:04.040]  Your teachings and things of that nature have have
[3:53:04.040 --> 3:53:09.600]  Actually warranted me to ask you a question if you've heard of the gentleman by the name of Mastin Herriman
[3:53:10.320 --> 3:53:12.560]  It's real for me, but I'm not placing it
[3:53:13.720 --> 3:53:15.720]  So he's a gentleman that has
[3:53:16.280 --> 3:53:18.840]  He's been able to take the
[3:53:20.160 --> 3:53:22.160]  He was able to actually
[3:53:23.000 --> 3:53:27.960]  Mathematically measure the radius of a proton and then from that
[3:53:27.960 --> 3:53:37.080]  Mathematical equation he was able to figure out that what he says is a mini black hole at the center of every proton in the universe
[3:53:37.080 --> 3:53:42.520]  And it really speaks to how when you say we have infinite potential in our divinity
[3:53:42.840 --> 3:53:46.240]  It really really he actually mathematically
[3:53:47.360 --> 3:53:52.600]  Postulates or or even proves that that type of doctrine and I just want to say
[3:53:52.600 --> 3:53:59.280]  That I really think you should look into this gentleman and and really love the work that you do sir. Thank you very much
[3:53:59.280 --> 3:54:03.480]  I appreciate you know, I'm thinking thinking about you know, sort of how
[3:54:04.240 --> 3:54:06.880]  Reality is constructed, you know, and you think about the world
[3:54:08.560 --> 3:54:15.120]  You know and what we're learning and what has been learned is that all things are in fact connected fundamentally
[3:54:15.120 --> 3:54:15.480]  in fact
[3:54:15.480 --> 3:54:22.000]  There's probably more in the empty space than the space that we see in terms of of dark matter and the things are being discovered and
[3:54:22.000 --> 3:54:24.000]  And and each thing takes us closer
[3:54:25.200 --> 3:54:30.320]  To the divinity of it to the to the creation itself. I mean these are
[3:54:31.120 --> 3:54:36.640]  Really important appears time and what I think the caller was referring to is what's being referred to as non locality
[3:54:37.200 --> 3:54:40.080]  The idea of things being able to affect things at a distance
[3:54:40.920 --> 3:54:41.920]  instantaneously
[3:54:41.920 --> 3:54:48.040]  This is a very different kind of principle the principles were used to working with either than with vectors and time and space
[3:54:48.040 --> 3:54:54.600]  Relationships this kind of violates that where things sort of appear all at once being they're all there at the same moment
[3:54:55.360 --> 3:55:00.840]  That may be a closer view of the actual reality in terms of how things are linked
[3:55:01.480 --> 3:55:03.680]  Science will show us this time will tell
[3:55:04.520 --> 3:55:11.480]  But I think there's way way more to the world than obviously than we see because we are in fact
[3:55:12.280 --> 3:55:15.760]  Transducers, you know, we pick up heat wind sensation on the skin
[3:55:15.760 --> 3:55:20.320]  I'm smell sound vision all these are based on
[3:55:21.040 --> 3:55:27.920]  Vibration, you know when you look at the electromagnetic spectrum and within that is a visible visible section of the spectrum which we can see
[3:55:28.600 --> 3:55:32.600]  But then there's the infrared and ultraviolet which we don't see but other species can
[3:55:33.280 --> 3:55:37.920]  Sound is the same way. We only hear up to a certain level between 150 and
[3:55:37.920 --> 3:55:46.200]  24,000 Hertz or vibrations per second, but dolphins for instance can hear up to a quarter of a million vibrations per second
[3:55:46.200 --> 3:55:53.280]  So is the sound not there? Of course the sound is there, but our bandwidth our ability to perceive is limited
[3:55:53.440 --> 3:55:57.920]  By our biological carrier that our soul is embedded in all right
[3:55:57.960 --> 3:56:05.560]  So the carrier regulates, but the soul is our connection to the infinite and this is when we can connect
[3:56:05.560 --> 3:56:10.960]  With the infinite that the energy flows within us and you can feel it flowing out of you
[3:56:10.960 --> 3:56:15.000]  You can feel it. I mean I can feel it now as I even say it it comes from my voice
[3:56:15.000 --> 3:56:21.920]  It comes from me because within my voice is the modulation the sub modulation of my very soul
[3:56:22.160 --> 3:56:23.880]  That's why I don't need a monitor
[3:56:23.880 --> 3:56:30.320]  That's why Alex doesn't need a monitor any other host in this network. We don't need monitors to speak from the heart
[3:56:30.320 --> 3:56:38.640]  We don't need filtering systems because we are the filtering system and we have let go of those filters for the for the root of truth
[3:56:39.680 --> 3:56:46.640]  Recognizing that sometimes what we cling to in our truth might be disrupted by new information and we have the integrity to grow in that
[3:56:46.800 --> 3:56:48.720]  That's the beauty of this network
[3:56:48.720 --> 3:56:54.960]  We are all growing together in the knowledge and hopefully the knowledge takes us to a point of wisdom
[3:56:54.960 --> 3:57:01.480]  Well, we can apply it because we see a lot of information in the world. We don't see much wisdom in the world and that's the
[3:57:01.600 --> 3:57:07.840]  Unfortunate story, you know, we're coming up to the end of the hour. We only have a few moments left. Unfortunately. I'm sorry callers
[3:57:07.840 --> 3:57:09.440]  I can't take any more
[3:57:09.440 --> 3:57:11.440]  But I want to encourage people today
[3:57:11.960 --> 3:57:18.800]  To look inside themselves find your inner power find the spark of divinity within you and take an
[3:57:18.800 --> 3:57:26.440]  Action that changes the course of history. Each of us do it a million actions get done 40 million actions get done
