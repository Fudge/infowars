[00:48.840 --> 00:52.960]  calls for the entire first hour believe it or not yes a call-based talk show
[00:52.960 --> 00:59.000]  it's here someone sent me this and I knew about this civilian police force but
[00:59.000 --> 01:03.640]  I didn't realize that the Marine Corps was the one that was backing it you know
[01:03.640 --> 01:08.000]  we've been talking a lot about the National Guard helping out to go after
[01:08.000 --> 01:13.400]  marijuana growers in Utah and Nevada and now in New Hampshire and then they're
[01:13.400 --> 01:17.080]  gonna help us fight crime but this program has been around for a while
[01:17.080 --> 01:21.080]  we've reported on I didn't realize it was a Marine Corpse program and this is
[01:21.080 --> 01:27.600]  off usmccle.com the Marine Corpse is always looking for a few good
[01:27.600 --> 01:30.560]  people if you have pride in yourself and what you do the Marine Corpse
[01:30.560 --> 01:35.440]  civilian police may be for you the Marine Corpse is looking for a few good
[01:35.440 --> 01:39.920]  people in fact they are looking for many good people in June 2008 the Marine
[01:39.920 --> 01:45.240]  Corpse adopted a plan to begin hiring approximately 1200 civilian police
[01:45.240 --> 01:50.240]  officers this expansion of civilian policing will reduce the operational
[01:50.240 --> 01:54.400]  stress on Marine Corpse military police and will enhance security and police
[01:54.400 --> 02:01.440]  service across the Marine Corps since 9-11 of course 9-11 the reason for
[02:01.440 --> 02:06.720]  everything you know it's the reason for the Patriot Act so reason for DHS yeah
[02:06.720 --> 02:09.160]  the Department of Homeland Security that's all 9-11 even though they're not
[02:09.160 --> 02:12.680]  going after Islamic terror anymore they're going after the alternative media
[02:12.680 --> 02:18.560]  hacktivist anti-illegal immigration Patriots sovereign citizens tax
[02:18.560 --> 02:23.720]  protesters that's what DHS is about now did you listen when Alex Jones warned
[02:23.720 --> 02:28.920]  you almost 10 years ago now you didn't listen you said oh god nuts well it's
[02:28.920 --> 02:34.680]  the real deal we've been exposing these DHS Fusion Center documents like no other
[02:34.680 --> 02:40.120]  and remember since 9-11 all branches of the military have identified greater
[02:40.120 --> 02:44.920]  requirements for police and security to protect the property and the people that
[02:44.920 --> 02:50.040]  are responsible our responsibility for the defense of the nation Johnny
[02:50.040 --> 02:57.240]  nonsense folks Johnny nonsense 9-11 folks we haven't been attacked again for a
[02:57.240 --> 03:01.120]  reason they haven't had drills with their black ops soldiers of running
[03:01.120 --> 03:05.920]  planes in the buildings that's why we haven't been attacked okay and we
[03:05.920 --> 03:14.040]  exposed the fact that 9-11 was an inside job that's right it wasn't 19 guys from
[03:14.040 --> 03:19.440]  caves it wasn't 17 Saudi nationals most of the people that came in through Saudi
[03:19.440 --> 03:26.320]  Arabia magically came in through a CIA front base let me say it again a CIA
[03:26.320 --> 03:31.360]  front base in Jeddah Saudi Arabia we actually had the ex-head of the visa
[03:31.360 --> 03:37.360]  department go public and say he was told to leave after he refused to give people
[03:37.360 --> 03:44.600]  visas who were part of a black ops program headed up by their asset Osama
[03:44.600 --> 03:50.080]  bin Laden J. Michael springman and you can check that on fabled enemies I mean
[03:50.080 --> 03:56.200]  we go over it big time it just it rocks my world that there's still so we need
[03:56.200 --> 04:03.480]  Marine Corps civilian police cousin 9-11 it's just unbelievable limitations on
[04:03.480 --> 04:07.160]  growing the active duty force have resulted in the hiring of civilians to
[04:07.160 --> 04:10.880]  provide security and law enforcement services across the Department of Defense
[04:10.880 --> 04:15.800]  the Marine Corps initiated the civilian police force in 2005 and has established
[04:15.800 --> 04:20.000]  Marine Corps police departments in Albany in Albany Georgia Jacksonville Florida
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.920]  and Barstow California the new police officer hires are spread across four
[04:24.920 --> 04:29.000]  years with a target of hiring 400 police officers in these separate regions I
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  don't want to read them all off as requirements increase and replacements
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.320]  are needed it's the end of posi commentatus the end of the separation of
[04:36.320 --> 04:41.920]  police and military and just the outward police state coming home to roose and we

[15:44.680 --> 15:49.000]  uh temperature to go up eight degrees and we're all gonna die and then the
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.640]  people that are left are gonna become cannibals and we're all gonna be in a
[15:51.640 --> 15:55.000]  failed state by Somali and then he literally says the reason that we have
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.480]  global warming is there are too many people on the earth we need population
[15:59.480 --> 16:02.760]  sustainability and that's why I'm against things like the world
[16:02.760 --> 16:09.320]  sustainability society which of course Obama's climate czar the global warming
[16:09.320 --> 16:14.520]  czar that he hired is also a member with our good friend Gordon Brown population
[16:14.520 --> 16:19.520]  sustainability means they want to kill a bunch of us but you know Carl in
[16:19.520 --> 16:24.720]  Wyoming wouldn't know that because you know he doesn't understand that Baxter
[16:24.720 --> 16:28.600]  the people that they are going to give the vaccine and if you don't think that
[16:28.600 --> 16:33.240]  they're given back that's Baxter this vaccine contract that's who they're
[16:33.240 --> 16:37.320]  talking about in this clip this Freudian slip clip that we're going to play
[16:37.320 --> 16:42.760]  Baxter gets caught sending out a vaccine to 14 separate nations with two types
[16:42.760 --> 16:48.340]  of live bird flu in it and a live type of human flu that immediately kills a
[16:48.340 --> 16:53.120]  ferret they look at it they're like oh my god and this is who we're trusting but
[16:53.120 --> 16:57.000]  yeah population reduction doesn't exist the world sustainable society doesn't
[16:57.000 --> 17:02.560]  exist give me a break Mike in Tennessee you're on the air good morning Jason that
[17:02.560 --> 17:06.360]  last color he's living proof that critical thinking is no longer taught in
[17:06.360 --> 17:11.000]  the public schools let me tell you about that last caller without name and
[17:11.000 --> 17:16.960]  names okay that last caller is a spoiled brat who's in his 40s and acts like a
[17:16.960 --> 17:20.920]  child because he was given to everything by his parents he's never had to work a
[17:20.920 --> 17:24.560]  day in his life outside of his family okay he's always had money he travels
[17:24.560 --> 17:27.800]  around the country for his little baseball team which is the most important
[17:27.800 --> 17:31.920]  thing in the world to him and he is off his rocker because he can't even read
[17:31.920 --> 17:36.480]  the mainstream media reports that Baxter is putting deadly viruses in their
[17:36.480 --> 17:40.280]  vaccines and he's like they don't want to kill us well you know what when your
[17:40.280 --> 17:44.120]  kids take the vaccines and they die in a month buddy we'll see what happens we'll
[17:44.120 --> 17:48.840]  see if you're smiling then we'll see if you're alive then go ahead well I know
[17:48.840 --> 17:51.880]  that Alex is taking well-deserved day off and then I hope that he has time to
[17:51.880 --> 17:55.040]  go fishing or just anything else that has the ability to soothe the spirit
[17:55.040 --> 17:58.960]  because certainly he needs it and well deserves it but and I would say if you
[17:58.960 --> 18:02.360]  can't pull out Willie Nelson and play that song that's it says front porch
[18:02.360 --> 18:06.200]  sitting in an old rock and chair that's that's a apropos for that type of
[18:06.200 --> 18:10.920]  activity but you talk about the Marines earlier and having civilians for
[18:10.920 --> 18:15.680]  policing service I have a friend who is an Air Force military police officer
[18:15.680 --> 18:20.680]  active duty and he recently told me within the last week that they have
[18:20.680 --> 18:26.440]  replaced all of them MPs on the base where he was with civilians $15 an hour
[18:26.440 --> 18:29.480]  civilians and the reason they're doing that is because they're going to use the
[18:29.480 --> 18:34.880]  MPs for security inside the United States there they're combined the police
[18:34.880 --> 18:39.240]  with the Marines with the National Guard they're ending posi commentatus so they
[18:39.240 --> 18:44.120]  have to hire these civilians to do the job that our military was supposed to be
[18:44.120 --> 18:49.160]  doing and all of his fellow MPs are being deployed where are they going are
[18:49.160 --> 18:56.200]  they going out to Afghanistan and Iraq all that maybe one or two are going
[18:56.200 --> 19:01.400]  abroad I just say that and a few are going to remain states are doing
[19:01.400 --> 19:07.400]  training so they're going to be going into the NLE09 exercise where our
[19:07.400 --> 19:11.400]  military is going to be integrated with the United Kingdom's military with the
[19:11.400 --> 19:15.080]  Mexican military with the Canadian military with the Australian military

[24:22.280 --> 24:25.880]  must fall to 30 million remember there's 70 million people there right now says
[24:25.880 --> 24:29.640]  poor Jonathan Port one of Gordon Brown's leading green advisors is to warn
[24:29.640 --> 24:33.200]  that Britain must drastically reduce its population if it is but to build a
[24:33.200 --> 24:38.280]  sustainable society when you hear the word sustainable it means some of us
[24:38.280 --> 24:45.200]  have to die do you get it sustainability means death okay the trust will release
[24:45.200 --> 24:49.320]  research suggesting UK population must be cut to 30 million if the country wants
[24:49.320 --> 24:54.160]  to feed itself sustainably that's why they're trying to press all these you
[24:54.160 --> 24:59.320]  know carbon taxes and charge you for your carbon footprint they want you dead
[24:59.320 --> 25:05.600]  okay or enslaved I'm sorry that's the real I'm not the one writing this we
[25:05.600 --> 25:10.560]  have to cut this by 80% CO2 80% they have to cut 80% and the population growth
[25:10.560 --> 25:15.960]  is going to make that much harder let's see Britain's population is expected to
[25:15.960 --> 25:21.200]  grow from 61 million now to 71 million by 2031 I think it's already at 71
[25:21.200 --> 25:25.880]  million I think the 61 million doesn't include you know I think that's of a
[25:25.880 --> 25:30.840]  relatively and it wouldn't matter if it's 60 minutes I still have 50% cut a
[25:30.840 --> 25:36.080]  50% cut how is that gonna happen people would have to stop having children and
[25:36.080 --> 25:40.680]  drop dead half of us that's it and then Obama climate czar and this is out of a
[25:40.680 --> 25:44.120]  Washington Times that's out of the telegram or times online by the way to me
[25:44.120 --> 25:48.440]  these are main line sources they're telling you what they're going to do
[25:48.440 --> 25:52.120]  until last week Carl M. Browner president elect Barack Obama's pick as
[25:52.120 --> 25:57.560]  global warming czar because we need czars in this country was listed as one
[25:57.560 --> 26:01.880]  of the 14 leaders of a socialist groups Commission for a sustainable world
[26:01.880 --> 26:07.320]  society who else is in there oh Gordon Brown is in there what do you know oh
[26:07.320 --> 26:11.400]  and she's for global governance which is world government which equals new

[26:16.440 --> 26:18.960]  gonna go back on the other side we're gonna play this Ted Turner clip where
[26:18.960 --> 26:23.240]  he says essentially the same thing go ahead Charlie yeah and I'm telling you
[26:23.240 --> 26:28.120]  about that only 35% of the money made off the red light cameras going to the
[26:28.120 --> 26:32.280]  city and the other is going to a foreign company that put them in so that
[26:32.280 --> 26:35.760]  Saturday we're having a protest that try to get them to down you know that's
[26:35.760 --> 26:39.480]  actually not bad that 30% actually goes to the city I've seen cases where it's
[26:39.480 --> 26:43.200]  less than 10% and it's really just a private money making scheme but the
[26:43.200 --> 26:45.920]  but the state loves it you know why they love it they love it because they're
[26:45.920 --> 26:49.520]  they get you ready for surveillance they get the database information has
[26:49.520 --> 26:52.400]  nothing to do with fighting crime has nothing to do with paying taxes has
[26:52.400 --> 26:56.040]  nothing to do with fixing roads it's all about control I thank you for the call
[26:56.040 --> 26:59.280]  Charlie and keep up the good work you should be protesting that all right

[27:08.120 --> 27:12.880]  information from my area I was noticing this morning a vehicle out in the street
[27:12.880 --> 27:16.560]  you know just didn't look right in the neighborhood and it's a regular civilian
[27:16.560 --> 27:21.240]  vehicle and you know I saw they had a orange vest on where the census people
[27:21.240 --> 27:25.400]  oh yeah yeah finally by the way people are picking up on that census story
[27:25.400 --> 27:29.720]  WorldNet Daily is now talking about oh yeah by the way the census is coming and
[27:29.720 --> 27:34.000]  there's not much you can do about it here it is right here the article is from
[27:34.000 --> 27:37.800]  May the 5th census GPS tagging your home's front door they plan on getting
[27:37.800 --> 27:42.520]  every single home within 40 feet and there's nothing you can do about it or
[27:42.520 --> 27:47.320]  so they say continue the thing is you know I was really polite to him and he
[27:47.320 --> 27:50.600]  was really polite to me back they're not coming to your house and letting you
[27:50.600 --> 27:57.200]  know their GPS and they're just driving by GPS and well I noticed so I went to
[27:57.200 --> 28:02.200]  ask what was going on because I was just concerned for my neighborhood and I asked
[28:02.200 --> 28:09.880]  him to please remove my address from that GPS and real nice fella polite we
[28:09.880 --> 28:15.400]  went through it and you know so say remove my address you know or bullet
[28:15.400 --> 28:22.960]  from the GPS you know which you can know there but anyways that's well I'm
[28:22.960 --> 28:25.440]  telling you right now even if he did it in front of you you know we had a caller
[28:25.440 --> 28:29.640]  in yesterday who had an 800 foot driveway he was followed in by a census
[28:29.640 --> 28:32.920]  worker he told the census worker that he wanted them to leave they were very
[28:32.920 --> 28:36.760]  polite to him she did leave but she said look they're just gonna send somebody
[28:36.760 --> 28:40.560]  else we're GPS in this thing whether you like it or not it is the control grid
[28:40.560 --> 28:44.520]  they've been setting up for a while and they're going full force at this point

[28:51.800 --> 28:56.860]  about the Census Bureau coming and now they're admitting that it's every single
[28:56.860 --> 28:59.840]  home you want to live off the grid you want to live in the woods not for long
[28:59.840 --> 29:06.720]  they want this whole Google Earth Street view RFID population of total and
[29:06.720 --> 29:11.480]  complete control with a global currency that fits in a chip that goes in your

[29:22.040 --> 29:26.280]  UK that is banning people from coming into her country and saying everybody
[29:26.280 --> 29:30.440]  needs an ID card and it doesn't much matter because 30,000 people already have
[29:30.440 --> 29:34.360]  it with the facial recognition scanning with the biometric thumbprint and they'll
[29:34.360 --> 29:38.200]  have 70 million by the end of the year and that's her words not I'm sorry

[30:04.560 --> 30:08.880]  from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid even as energy
[30:08.880 --> 30:12.720]  experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits
[30:12.720 --> 30:16.560]  of our nation's power grid some say that this summer's demand for electrical
[30:16.560 --> 30:20.880]  power may finally push the grid over its edge creating a cascade of power
[30:20.880 --> 30:25.680]  outages across the country putting us all in the dark are you prepared for the
[30:25.680 --> 30:30.040]  next round of storm related outages or government created blackouts have you

[33:28.280 --> 33:33.160]  go clips the phone calls it's the Alex Jones show and if you don't think
[33:33.160 --> 33:38.480]  population sustainability means death listen closely what the lovely Ted
[33:38.480 --> 33:43.520]  Turner has to say and then listen even closer to what the health officials in
[33:43.520 --> 33:49.520]  the UK are saying about Baxter and their delicious vaccinations hit it not
[33:49.520 --> 33:54.000]  doing it will be catastrophic we'll have eight degrees will be eight degrees
[33:54.000 --> 33:59.200]  hotter in 10 dot 10 but in 30 or 40 years and basically none of the crops
[33:59.200 --> 34:03.160]  will grow most of people have died and the rest of us will be cannibal
[34:03.160 --> 34:07.880]  civilization will have broken down what the few people left will be living in
[34:07.880 --> 34:13.200]  a in a failed state like Somalia or Sudan and living conditions will be
[34:13.200 --> 34:17.360]  intolerable the droughts will be so bad there'll be no more corn growing it will
[34:17.360 --> 34:23.520]  not doing it is suicide just like dropping bombs on each other nuclear
[34:23.520 --> 34:28.440]  weapons is suicide so we've got to stop doing the two suicidal things what you're
[34:28.440 --> 34:32.720]  new you're on our nuclear weapons and global and then after that we got that
[34:32.720 --> 34:37.200]  we've got to stabilize the population when I was born there was a lot of
[34:37.200 --> 34:41.200]  population I mean we're too many people that's what that's why we have global
[34:41.200 --> 34:45.280]  warming we have global warming goes too many people are using too much stuff but
[34:45.280 --> 34:48.560]  they have less people they'd be using less stuff all right stop it right there
[34:48.560 --> 34:53.280]  right there too many people right now listen I live in the woods there can be
[34:53.280 --> 34:57.680]  a whole bunch more people but they don't want that he calls us useless feeders
[34:57.680 --> 35:03.080]  and eaters do you get it he already said there's too many people today today
[35:03.080 --> 35:08.320]  listen people have kids there they're not gonna stop having children unless they
[35:08.320 --> 35:12.320]  sterilize us it's human nature our population would grow even with all the
[35:12.320 --> 35:16.840]  plagues they have put on this planet even their attack on third-world nations
[35:16.840 --> 35:21.920]  like Africa the population just keeps growing and growing and growing and
[35:21.920 --> 35:26.080]  guess what they don't want that and remember Baxter the lovely people at
[35:26.080 --> 35:29.440]  Baxter send out vaccinations with live viruses in them and they're the ones
[35:29.440 --> 35:33.200]  that are going to save us from the swine flu in fact I covered this on the show
[35:33.200 --> 35:37.000]  last night WHO here's some fear monger this is the real fear mongering all you
[35:37.000 --> 35:40.520]  people out there that say I'm a fear monger or Alex Jones is a fear monger
[35:40.520 --> 35:45.000]  for reporting what's on the mainstream media you're ridiculous okay I'm not
[35:45.000 --> 35:50.640]  saying this the WHO who puts out pandemic alert guidelines where they say in
[35:50.640 --> 35:56.240]  section one point five point one that you have no human rights at all no
[35:56.240 --> 35:59.800]  individual human rights that's what it says that you'll be forced to take
[35:59.800 --> 36:07.360]  compulsory vaccinations I mean what and quarantines what don't you get this is
[36:07.360 --> 36:10.920]  for you this isn't for Ted Turner Ted Turner is not gonna be in a FEMA camp
[36:10.920 --> 36:16.560]  quarantine taking a shot are you sick and then the WHO comes out and they say
[36:16.560 --> 36:23.920]  up to two billion people might get swine flu one in three one in three those
[36:23.920 --> 36:29.000]  are biblical numbers let's say even a quarter of those two billion go down
[36:29.000 --> 36:35.760]  that's a 500 million death half a billion death if one in four is it one of
[36:35.760 --> 36:38.400]  four what is it is that about right one of four one three I don't know I'm all
[36:38.400 --> 36:43.520]  over the place I'm just I can't take it folks I just can't take it that these
[36:43.520 --> 36:47.120]  people are hyping up something that hasn't killed really anybody you know
[36:47.120 --> 36:49.800]  they said and we're gonna play that clip to we need to play that clip that AP
[36:49.800 --> 36:53.120]  clip from last night jaren that we played where the woman they said this
[36:53.120 --> 36:56.520]  woman died of swine flu it's all over the media oh second death remember the
[36:56.520 --> 37:00.800]  first death wasn't an American citizen it was a two-year-old child who was a
[37:00.800 --> 37:05.100]  premature birth had all sorts of health issues and supposedly died in a Texas
[37:05.100 --> 37:09.040]  hospital of the swine flu I don't know if I even believe that and this 33-year-old
[37:09.040 --> 37:13.240]  teacher out of Texas they stopped short of saying that she died from the swine
[37:13.240 --> 37:17.720]  flu doesn't matter it's all it's swine flu killed her swine flu killed her and
[37:17.720 --> 37:20.440]  then they say you know what it might leave during the summer but it'll be
[37:20.440 --> 37:24.280]  back in the winter it'll be back in the winter and that's what really the sky
[37:24.280 --> 37:29.680]  news pieces about they're asking him about baxter doing the vaccinations let's
[37:29.680 --> 37:35.120]  play that let's just play it and we'll analyze it in a moment hit it create you
[37:35.120 --> 37:40.840]  a pandemic vaccine if required and without impacting on seasonal flu
[37:40.840 --> 37:45.440]  vaccine production we think it is I've just told parliament that's our
[37:45.440 --> 37:53.620]  objective to have the vaccine ready a pandemic specific vaccine ready we
[37:53.620 --> 37:58.560]  now taking up the capacity that we need for the seasonal flu virus now of the
[37:58.560 --> 38:03.640]  seasonal virus oh the virus wait wait do you mean that they might be spreading
[38:03.640 --> 38:08.560]  the virus and the vaccinations the guy's guilty look on his face is on be
[38:08.560 --> 38:12.880]  leaveable and remember this woman who supposedly died of the swine flu the
[38:12.880 --> 38:16.880]  associated press won't even say that she died of the swine flu yet her face is
[38:16.880 --> 38:21.680]  all over the media all over the the papers the papers that are failing by
[38:21.680 --> 38:25.240]  the way and now the Senate says we're gonna save the mainstream media we're
[38:25.240 --> 38:28.960]  gonna save the newspapers we're gonna make them tax exempt organizations
[38:28.960 --> 38:32.600]  where they're basically making them even more government-controlled than they
[38:32.600 --> 38:37.560]  already are let the Boston Globe fail let the New York Times fail all they've
[38:37.560 --> 38:44.840]  done is lie to us my god all right let's go to who we are on Anthony in Ohio

[39:16.400 --> 39:22.720]  because he is insane yeah the same guy who follows baseball stars around in
[39:22.720 --> 39:28.960]  Stockton yeah yeah he's a professional stalker really but anyways man I just
[39:28.960 --> 39:32.760]  wanted to real quickly plug in an event we're having tomorrow here in Dayton

[40:22.240 --> 40:25.040]  they're going after the web that's why the Alex Jones channel is shut down
[40:25.040 --> 40:29.360]  right now that's why they froze my movie fabled enemies when I was number one in
[40:29.360 --> 40:32.040]  the world in the beginning of September and number one in the world in

[41:16.480 --> 41:20.720]  very hard to find I mean I'm reading right here the Marine Corps civilian
[41:20.720 --> 41:25.520]  police and I mean it's it's been in place since June of 2008 we know we're
[41:25.520 --> 41:30.000]  having the NLE09 drill which is to prevent a terrorist attack first to its
[41:30.000 --> 41:34.460]  current headed up by our good friends at FEMA DHS approved I mean DHS
[41:34.460 --> 41:38.760]  integrated as well and again this is going to have foreign troops involved
[41:38.760 --> 41:42.640]  we're working with all these other nations the entire private sector is
[41:42.640 --> 41:46.320]  going to be involved who knows if that means black water and AT&T and all the
[41:46.320 --> 41:50.400]  other little private companies they love to use okay but we know it's going to
[41:50.400 --> 41:54.880]  involve all local government all state government even tribal governments and
[41:54.880 --> 42:01.000]  it's going to be run by the federalis and it's coming this summer NLE09 go
[42:01.000 --> 42:05.560]  check it out don't take my word for it just go see it you know and you got a
[42:05.560 --> 42:11.320]  wonder if NLE09 is going to coincide with yet another flu scare again zero
[42:11.320 --> 42:15.060]  deaths here but it's okay jaren by the way do we have that clip of the AP woman
[42:15.060 --> 42:18.400]  yet no we don't all right we'll pull that up in the next segment it's very
[42:18.400 --> 42:22.680]  short and we'll play it on the other side I thank you for the call Mike let's
[42:22.680 --> 42:29.120]  go to Eric in Michigan Eric you're online yes sir hey Jason first off I want
[42:29.120 --> 42:32.720]  to thank you very much for your film loose change it completely changed my
[42:32.720 --> 42:37.000]  life woke me up and proceeded to walk to wake up many of my friends and family
[42:37.000 --> 42:41.120]  members excellent man that's the point you know we're trying to reach out to an
[42:41.120 --> 42:45.480]  audience that wouldn't normally look at this stuff and unfortunately people just
[42:45.480 --> 42:48.720]  don't read anymore it's very hard for people to get around this information
[42:48.720 --> 42:53.640]  with just an article or a five-minute YouTube video people speak MTV people
[42:53.640 --> 42:57.720]  speak movies and that's why it is so important to get this information into
[42:57.720 --> 43:02.880]  a palatable format of 90 to 120 minutes where people can sit down see the
[43:02.880 --> 43:06.080]  information it can change their mind and if they want to go back and check
[43:06.080 --> 43:09.720]  everything out it's sourced so you can say wow that is a real article oh my god
[43:09.720 --> 43:14.440]  they really did report that on the news continue well I wanted to update you guys
[43:14.440 --> 43:18.840]  on the Census Bureau I had my confrontation and I wish I could say they
[43:18.840 --> 43:23.520]  were nice and polite like the other callers did but when I confronted him
[43:23.520 --> 43:27.840]  as he about to walk through my hedge line onto my property I proceeded to ask
[43:27.840 --> 43:32.320]  who he was he told me and I I confronted him with the fact that he was GPS in
[43:32.320 --> 43:37.160]  front doors and he acted like he had no idea that I that I should know he didn't
[43:37.160 --> 43:41.440]  think I should know then he proceeded to tell me I kindly asked him you know I
[43:41.440 --> 43:45.400]  say I'm gonna kindly ask you not to come on my property today sir and he
[43:45.400 --> 43:50.200]  proceeded to get a very irate and attack me told me that he'd call the police and
[43:50.200 --> 43:54.040]  he had every legal right to come on my property and I told him go ahead and
[43:54.040 --> 44:00.480]  call the police he continued to threaten me called me an a-hole and an animal and
[44:00.480 --> 44:04.400]  you know I told him numerous times call the cops haven't come out we'll see what
[44:04.400 --> 44:08.280]  they have to say about it he didn't do it but he did like to bring up the fact
[44:08.280 --> 44:13.160]  that he asked me if I'd ever served and I said well you mean the military he says
[44:13.160 --> 44:18.600]  yes the military I told him no because I haven't my family members have I've got
[44:18.600 --> 44:22.360]  numerous that's my family but that makes you less of an American citizen if you
[44:22.360 --> 44:26.220]  didn't serve in the military yeah that's ridiculous well I'm sorry that they
[44:26.220 --> 44:29.360]  brainwashed him in the military because obviously he served or he wouldn't have
[44:29.360 --> 44:32.440]  said that to you I'm sorry your brainwashed sir and you think it's okay
[44:32.440 --> 44:36.520]  to GPS everybody's house and create a control grid for your globalist masters
[44:36.520 --> 44:40.360]  but we're not down we're about personal freedom we're supposed to be secure in
[44:40.360 --> 44:45.280]  our persons and property I'm sorry if your animalistic bosses they're the a-holes

[44:52.760 --> 44:56.720]  just GPS my house and force me to get into this control grid of course it's
[44:56.720 --> 45:01.080]  not that's what DHS was set up to do are we starting to realize it when they put
[45:01.080 --> 45:05.240]  out we've exposed three separate DHS documents on top of the myac report and
[45:05.240 --> 45:09.400]  they are going after us and then we have this arrest of a person in Louisiana by
[45:09.400 --> 45:12.800]  the way if we can get this guy's name anybody out out there from Louisiana knows
[45:12.800 --> 45:17.480]  who this is this guy got arrested and detained for having a don't tread on me

[45:44.480 --> 45:48.880]  over to the 15th of every month until we the people get the answers that we want
[45:48.880 --> 45:55.320]  and it's a way of bringing awareness to people about the income tax issue for
[45:55.320 --> 46:01.880]  one thing about the illegality the IRS we encourage people right off the bat to
[46:01.880 --> 46:06.080]  watch America freedom to fascism I'm pretty amazed at all the people who are
[46:06.080 --> 46:11.080]  participating in the teabag movement who have not yet seen that film well those
[46:11.080 --> 46:14.440]  are the teabaggers they're not the tea party people those are the people that
[46:14.440 --> 46:18.280]  just jumped on because Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck told them so and they have
[46:18.280 --> 46:21.680]  no idea about the 16th amendment they don't know that the Federal Reserve is
[46:21.680 --> 46:25.080]  private except for what Glenn Beck has told them they don't understand that they
[46:25.080 --> 46:28.320]  just print the money out of nowhere and the majority of your federal income tax
[46:28.320 --> 46:31.800]  I think it's something like 30 to 1 just goes to pay off the debt all your other
[46:31.800 --> 46:36.200]  you know everybody goes we need taxes for roads we need taxes for schools those
[46:36.200 --> 46:40.040]  are state taxes those are property taxes you pay those anyway has nothing to do
[46:40.040 --> 46:43.600]  with the Federal Reserve system and America freedom to fascism again is
[46:43.600 --> 46:48.600]  the best tool to wake people up to this I mean Aaron Russo God rest his soul
[46:48.600 --> 46:51.720]  thank you so much for what you did to this country you live on and that's why
[46:51.720 --> 46:56.840]  America freedom to fascism is named in the Mayak report as an evil terrorist
[46:56.840 --> 47:01.480]  document Karen thank you so much for the call let's go to Erica in Ohio Erica
[47:01.480 --> 47:07.240]  you're on the line hi Jason how are you I'm good I have a couple points I wanted
[47:07.240 --> 47:10.760]  to touch on I tried to call in on Friday you guys are talking about like the
[47:10.760 --> 47:14.840]  programming and stuff you you mentioned 30 rocks and how they were
[47:14.840 --> 47:19.720]  correlating with the flu and all that crazy crazy stuff on law and order they
[47:19.720 --> 47:23.280]  had one where a woman was on trial because she didn't immunize her daughter
[47:23.280 --> 47:29.320]  and her daughter ended up infecting another parent's child and they were
[47:29.320 --> 47:33.480]  trying her for abuse and murder and all this crazy stuff and it was literally
[47:33.480 --> 47:37.120]  two days after it started being all over the TV about the flu and I was just
[47:37.120 --> 47:41.640]  like you've got to be joking and you know what they've also gone after us
[47:41.640 --> 47:45.480]  because we've exposed the vaccines for what they are it's gone somewhat main
[47:45.480 --> 47:49.240]  line with Jenny McCarthy's book louder than words you know in her dating Jim
[47:49.240 --> 47:52.920]  Kerry one of the most mega superstars at the box office doesn't hurt for our
[47:52.920 --> 47:57.800]  cause but then you start seeing Time magazine covers with a baby taking a
[47:57.800 --> 48:02.040]  shot telling you all the bad parents who don't vaccinate their kids they're
[48:02.040 --> 48:05.240]  putting your kids at risk and now your kids are going to get sick from the
[48:05.240 --> 48:09.320]  evil parents that think vaccines are bad they're delicious just shut up and take
[48:09.320 --> 48:14.920]  them like they're letting them feel fear so you'll think well I would be a guy
[48:14.920 --> 48:18.600]  if I don't immunize little Jimmy and little Jimmy get little Carter sick I
[48:18.600 --> 48:22.760]  could be in trouble I mean it's just total fear mongering and I can't stand it
[48:22.760 --> 48:26.440]  and it just is something that I really wanted you know I was glad that you guys
[48:26.440 --> 48:29.480]  brought it up because I had tried to call about it and could never get through
[48:29.480 --> 48:32.200]  well you know what we don't bring it up nobody else is going to bring it up
[48:32.200 --> 48:35.280]  Erica and I thank you for the call and that's why Rupert Murdoch is now
[48:35.280 --> 48:38.920]  seeing the internet as we know it will soon be over it's a story over at
[48:38.920 --> 48:43.240]  prisonplanet.com by Paul Joseph Watson billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch
[48:43.240 --> 48:47.360]  gave a strange response when asked about plans for mainstream news websites to
[48:47.360 --> 48:52.000]  charge for content declaring the current days of the internet will soon be over
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.680]  because they're trying to pass the cyber security bill do you understand J
[48:55.680 --> 49:01.080]  Rockefeller not your friend the cyber bullying act where's that that's right
[49:01.080 --> 49:05.960]  in front of me here it is HR 1966 youth who create internet content and use
[49:05.960 --> 49:10.040]  social networking sites are more likely to be targets of cyber bullying we have
[49:10.040 --> 49:14.880]  to save the children the two to 17 year olds meanwhile they're trying to have
[49:14.880 --> 49:19.880]  the Supreme Court rule that you can send a child to prison for life yeah that's
[49:19.880 --> 49:22.360]  right they can charge them as an adult that's what they're trying to do and
[49:22.360 --> 49:25.640]  they're saying oh the rapists and murderers but don't worry it won't just be
[49:25.640 --> 49:29.240]  for rapists and murderers it'll be people that are classified as extremist
[49:29.240 --> 49:33.080]  terrorists in these DHS documents to and they'll just literally if they get their
[49:33.080 --> 49:38.080]  way put children in prison if they show signs of not going along with the system
[49:38.080 --> 49:42.480]  section 2 subsection 3 electronic communications provide anonymity to the
[49:42.480 --> 49:46.280]  perpetrator and the potential for widespread public distribution potentially
[49:46.280 --> 49:51.200]  making them severely dangerous and cruel to the youth what are you talking

[50:17.080 --> 50:22.400]  so soft in the society that this bill could even be introduced is gut wrenching

[54:44.600 --> 54:49.120]  reports are going on all over that my act report was just the tip of the spear
[54:49.120 --> 54:52.560]  remember that's not for public consumption meanwhile there's still
[54:52.560 --> 54:57.320]  fear mongering about this swine flu and no one has died from it in this country
[54:57.320 --> 55:02.400]  let me repeat that no one has died from it in this country that child was not an
[55:02.400 --> 55:05.720]  American citizen and we don't really know if he died a swine flu again he had
[55:05.720 --> 55:09.560]  all these different problems and now this woman 33 of Texas didn't die of the
[55:09.560 --> 55:15.440]  swine flu either don't take my word for it hit the clip a 33 year old school
[55:15.440 --> 55:19.480]  teacher from a Texas border town has been confirmed as the second death in the
[55:19.480 --> 55:24.280]  United States of a person with swine flu but listen closely had recently given
[55:24.280 --> 55:29.640]  birth to a healthy baby boy she'd been hospitalized since April 19th and Texas
[55:29.640 --> 55:33.600]  health officials have stopped short of saying that the flu caused the woman's
[55:33.600 --> 55:38.120]  death stop did have to stop right there do you just hear that they say this is
[55:38.120 --> 55:41.920]  the second case of someone who's died from the swine flu and 10 seconds later
[55:41.920 --> 55:45.280]  they say well we're gonna just stop short of saying that she actually died
[55:45.280 --> 55:50.200]  from the swine flu hit it this and did have underlying chronic health
[55:50.200 --> 55:55.440]  conditions oh so they're extenuating factors there so she was at Trunnell's
[55:55.440 --> 55:59.920]  school have been canceled until Monday but officials aren't concerned that
[55:59.920 --> 56:04.200]  students or the woman's co-workers will contract the virus there's really
[56:04.200 --> 56:07.840]  nothing to be done at this time again we're we're past two incubation periods
[56:07.840 --> 56:11.880]  if a person didn't contact the the influence already then they really don't
[56:11.880 --> 56:15.360]  have anything to worry about meanwhile Mexicans across the border are slowly

[1:00:48.960 --> 1:00:52.560]  that they had moved it to may 15th another month i was wondering if they
[1:00:52.560 --> 1:00:56.480]  had anything to do with that wet weather modification because it's been it's like
[1:00:56.480 --> 1:01:01.200]  excessively cold here for you know it to be almost june pushing june i was just
[1:01:01.200 --> 1:01:04.680]  wondering if that i was just in new york i wasn't in the city but i was just
[1:01:04.680 --> 1:01:08.160]  there like a week and a half ago i was there on the weekend of the 25th and
[1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:12.560]  26th april was gorgeous and i was like 85 degrees i was out playing and we had
[1:01:12.560 --> 1:01:16.680]  two back to back days but i'm just saying like like normally it's a lot warmer by
[1:01:16.680 --> 1:01:20.680]  now look all's i know is that they're openly putting out documents that they're
[1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:24.720]  going to be doing geoengineering they're openly saying that they might block the
[1:01:24.720 --> 1:01:30.200]  sun's rays with pollutants in the upper atmosphere meanwhile we can actually see
[1:01:30.200 --> 1:01:33.560]  the chemtrails but they don't exist it doesn't matter if the cfr's talked about
[1:01:33.560 --> 1:01:37.160]  it for years put it on paper it doesn't matter now if the new climate chief is
[1:01:37.160 --> 1:01:40.440]  talking about it doesn't matter if the barack obama administration is openly
[1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:44.240]  saying it look it exists they're incrementally telling you about it i
[1:01:44.240 --> 1:01:47.240]  think that they're just making you keep it on dick to jack your bill up man i
[1:01:47.240 --> 1:01:50.080]  don't think it has anything to do with weather mod but i could be wrong i

[1:02:04.360 --> 1:02:08.240]  that would be the one that uh... they've just introduced last week
[1:02:08.240 --> 1:02:10.120]  that uh...
[1:02:10.120 --> 1:02:11.800]  because the attorney general
[1:02:11.800 --> 1:02:15.960]  power to deny firearm anyone who suspected of a potentially a terrorist
[1:02:15.960 --> 1:02:19.360]  yes now we have covered alex covered earlier in the week and it is like a
[1:02:19.360 --> 1:02:23.560]  total gunband bill and they can just go after anybody and since the dhs is
[1:02:23.560 --> 1:02:28.000]  classifying everybody as a terrorist and extremist in this latest lexicon
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:29.080]  document in the
[1:02:29.080 --> 1:02:33.000]  mainstream media just laughs about it washington times goes up

[1:02:59.280 --> 1:03:02.320]  yet even if they pass that resolution it's against the constitution bill of
[1:03:02.320 --> 1:03:06.160]  rights and if there was ever a time for the second amendment it is that time
[1:03:06.160 --> 1:03:08.000]  give out the bill number again

[1:08:10.800 --> 1:08:15.280]  folks we are back at the Alex Jones show I'm Jason Burma sitting in and we are
[1:08:15.280 --> 1:08:19.920]  now joined by Bob Chapman of the international forecaster dot com and
[1:08:19.920 --> 1:08:23.400]  right off the bat I really want to get his take on the quote-unquote stress
[1:08:23.400 --> 1:08:27.320]  test and the government now saying oh we're just gonna give even more money to
[1:08:27.320 --> 1:08:31.120]  the banks a bank of america in particular saying another thirty plus
[1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:34.880]  billion which you know if they're able to loan it out will be much more than
[1:08:34.880 --> 1:08:38.840]  thirty billion as you know if you listen to this program how are you today Bob
[1:08:38.840 --> 1:08:45.480]  just terrific just terrific all right so let's get your take on this and then
[1:08:45.480 --> 1:08:51.920]  first of all um many of these banks and financial firms such as a brokerage
[1:08:51.920 --> 1:08:59.360]  houses a wall street AIG other insurance companies they are carrying CDOs and
[1:08:59.360 --> 1:09:06.440]  ABS is off balance sheet and they're still doing it now CDOs a collateralized
[1:09:06.440 --> 1:09:13.560]  debt obligations they are bonds which consist of mortgages the others the ABS
[1:09:13.560 --> 1:09:23.280]  are asset-backed securities and they have inside of those bonds credit card debt
[1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:34.400]  people who created a debt paper by buying motorcycles mobile homes automobiles
[1:09:35.320 --> 1:09:42.600]  swimming pools etc that kind of paper so to speak and what they've done
[1:09:42.600 --> 1:09:50.120]  because this paper is generally speaking unsalable they've kept it off the
[1:09:50.120 --> 1:09:56.040]  bank it's bad balance sheet and they put it into another corporation but it
[1:09:56.040 --> 1:10:04.160]  still belongs to them and at the same time what has happened is the f8 SB which
[1:10:04.160 --> 1:10:12.240]  is an international accounting organization which had corporations begin
[1:10:12.240 --> 1:10:21.360]  to report their balance sheets on a regular basis and marking their
[1:10:21.360 --> 1:10:27.720]  investments to the market now they changed it from that to marking them to
[1:10:27.720 --> 1:10:33.520]  model the difference let's say the Bank of America owns a million dollars worth
[1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:41.520]  of IBM bonds and they see the bonds trading each day and they have to put
[1:10:41.520 --> 1:10:46.560]  down in a balance sheet that IBM is trading at par which is a thousand
[1:10:46.560 --> 1:10:50.200]  dollars and we bought it at par so we didn't lose anything we didn't get
[1:10:50.200 --> 1:10:57.040]  anything we still have it on the books at a thousand dollars a bond now mark to
[1:10:57.040 --> 1:11:04.080]  model is different this is for securities that don't have a ready market that
[1:11:04.080 --> 1:11:09.840]  they might try to trade every six months or three months or maybe once a month and
[1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:18.440]  they usually made up of these CDOs and ABS's well as we all know now that these
[1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:23.960]  instruments that was sold at par which is a thousand dollars each they were
[1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:28.120]  called triple A when they were in fact triple B is difference between 10 and
[1:11:28.120 --> 1:11:35.760]  three or four that they're selling for when they do anywhere between 10 cents
[1:11:35.760 --> 1:11:41.440]  and 50 cents in the dollar and these entities like these banks are carrying
[1:11:41.440 --> 1:11:47.200]  on the books mark to model whatever they feel like it whatever they say it's
[1:11:47.200 --> 1:11:50.120]  worth that's what it is and the government says that just make it
[1:11:50.120 --> 1:11:54.920]  reasonable so instead of putting them in a par which is ridiculous they might put
[1:11:54.920 --> 1:12:00.440]  them in an 85 or 80 cents or 75 so they're carrying a whole bunch of
[1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:07.040]  investments that are not worth what they say they are so the situation with
[1:12:07.040 --> 1:12:13.640]  these banks and many others pension funds mutual funds brokerage firms they're
[1:12:13.640 --> 1:12:19.920]  carrying people like that paper being bonds and everything that they're
[1:12:19.920 --> 1:12:23.840]  telling you is bogus so what's this what's the impact going to be on the
[1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:32.680]  average american citizen what's going to happen eventually is the inflationary
[1:12:32.680 --> 1:12:40.320]  aspects being created by the fed will be offset eventually by the deflationary
[1:12:40.320 --> 1:12:44.560]  aspects that they're trying to drown out and have been for five and a half years
[1:12:44.560 --> 1:12:52.840]  so the next step will be a switch from inflation or hyperinflation probably
[1:12:52.840 --> 1:12:58.440]  two to three years down the road to deflation in a total collapse and they
[1:12:58.440 --> 1:13:04.880]  know this does not work it could work on a small scale but not with the debt
[1:13:04.880 --> 1:13:10.920]  that they have today now as that happens do you see them using these sdr units to
[1:13:10.920 --> 1:13:15.080]  take over as the world reserve currency and it kind of looks like it's it's
[1:13:15.080 --> 1:13:18.080]  headed that way right now the dollar will be dropped as the world reserve
[1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:22.880]  currency they brought in these sdr special drawing rights units after the g20
[1:13:22.880 --> 1:13:29.640]  Mexico recently took 47 billion dollars in sdrs due to the quote-unquote swine
[1:13:29.640 --> 1:13:35.440]  flu I mean what's the progression of this new global currency all it is is a
[1:13:35.440 --> 1:13:43.360]  bookkeeping entry it's another bigger federal reserve they're creating it out
[1:13:43.360 --> 1:13:49.680]  of thin air and they've been around since 1968-69 and they've been a disaster I
[1:13:49.680 --> 1:13:55.440]  mean they've never worked it's just another method of putting it off and so
[1:13:55.440 --> 1:14:02.000]  nobody has to come up with any money to give money to the government Mexico
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:08.420]  because they just debit their book I got credit their book and debit the
[1:14:08.420 --> 1:14:13.720]  Mexicans for the amount of money that's been went to them and so they have these
[1:14:13.720 --> 1:14:17.320]  special drawing rights that don't mean anything they're back by nothing there
[1:14:17.320 --> 1:14:21.240]  are another fiat currency and they will collapse as well probably
[1:14:21.240 --> 1:14:28.360]  simultaneously with the dollar and other assets they're not gonna work but
[1:14:28.360 --> 1:14:32.720]  that's what will happen to the island they don't listen to this program so
[1:14:32.720 --> 1:14:36.400]  then what will happen to the IMF and the Federal Reserve and the World Bank after
[1:14:36.400 --> 1:14:41.080]  something like that occurs they all go broke and what do you think they just
[1:14:41.080 --> 1:14:45.440]  create a new entity out of the three well I said that I think they'd like to do
[1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:49.320]  but if we stay on the radio we're gonna stop from doing it because people all
[1:14:49.320 --> 1:14:54.700]  over the world are listening to this and now they know that the game that these
[1:14:54.700 --> 1:14:59.000]  guys are up to and they're not gonna let them do it they don't want a world
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:02.040]  currency I get lots of letters from people all over the world we're not
[1:15:02.040 --> 1:15:05.920]  gonna let it happen in our country and thanks for telling us and we know the
[1:15:05.920 --> 1:15:09.640]  guys who are working with the guys in New York and London and Washington doing
[1:15:09.640 --> 1:15:15.800]  this and we're not gonna let them show some international monetary unit down
[1:15:15.800 --> 1:15:21.200]  outstretched when you tell people how they can get your newsletter Bob well
[1:15:21.200 --> 1:15:27.320]  there's two ways you can go to the international forecaster dot com the
[1:15:27.320 --> 1:15:42.400]  international f o r e c a s t e r dot com or you can call toll-free 877 479 8178
[1:15:42.400 --> 1:15:53.320]  that's 877 479 8178 I want to shift gears now to this latest DHS document
[1:15:53.320 --> 1:15:58.280]  that we've been reporting on since last week the domestic extremism lexicon that
[1:15:58.280 --> 1:16:02.440]  in the first paragraph of the first page it says you know this is for non
[1:16:02.440 --> 1:16:06.960]  Islamic extremism that poses a threat to the United States they say it's
[1:16:06.960 --> 1:16:11.600]  unclassified but for official use only it's exempt from an FLIA request and
[1:16:11.600 --> 1:16:15.560]  it's law enforcement sensitive and this thing right off the bat is going after
[1:16:15.560 --> 1:16:19.400]  the alternative media which is defined by a term used to describe various
[1:16:19.400 --> 1:16:23.320]  information sources that provide a forum for interpretations of events and
[1:16:23.320 --> 1:16:27.240]  issues that differ radically from those presented in the mass media products
[1:16:27.240 --> 1:16:30.520]  and outlets and now it doesn't say we're gonna cause terror it doesn't say that
[1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:35.000]  we're causing violence but we're the extremists we're the terrorists speak
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:42.360]  on that for a moment it's been a long time coming it's to be fully expected
[1:16:42.360 --> 1:16:50.680]  the adverts adversaries that we have probably have the power to do that they
[1:16:50.680 --> 1:16:56.320]  want to take us off the air where we're reaching millions of people every day I
[1:16:56.320 --> 1:17:03.320]  mean what is alex on nine hours a day I probably do maybe six or seven eight
[1:17:03.320 --> 1:17:08.560]  hours of programming a day and we're killing them because the world is
[1:17:08.560 --> 1:17:14.800]  finding out who the bad guys are and so you can expect that they will try to use
[1:17:14.800 --> 1:17:20.560]  that and I think probably they'll nibble at the edges first they probably come
[1:17:20.560 --> 1:17:26.600]  after people like me who don't have an actual show and and try to shut me up
[1:17:26.600 --> 1:17:31.520]  and if they can't do that well they'll call a station and say we don't want
[1:17:31.520 --> 1:17:36.800]  this guy on anymore and then the fight begins you know and now we're seeing real
[1:17:36.800 --> 1:17:41.120]  parts of the my act report coming home to roost you know we had a couple calls
[1:17:41.120 --> 1:17:44.800]  here and there saying I was pulled over for Ron Paul bumper sticker but nothing
[1:17:44.800 --> 1:17:49.520]  that was reported in mainline media and now we have a story over at info wars
[1:17:49.520 --> 1:17:54.200]  and prison planet that a Louisiana driver was stopped and detained for having a
[1:17:54.200 --> 1:17:58.400]  don't tread on me bumper sticker on his vehicle and mourned by a police officer
[1:17:58.400 --> 1:18:03.360]  about the subversive message it sent according to the driver's relative I
[1:18:03.360 --> 1:18:08.520]  mean this is absolutely ridiculous that you can't have a bumper sticker on your
[1:18:08.520 --> 1:18:15.640]  car without law enforcement illegally detaining you well they can do what they
[1:18:15.640 --> 1:18:21.120]  want as long as they can do it but that sort of approach and an approach of
[1:18:21.120 --> 1:18:26.920]  shedding Alex and you and and all the people like us off the air is going to
[1:18:26.920 --> 1:18:33.760]  force the American people in the midst of a depression and that's what we're in
[1:18:33.760 --> 1:18:41.200]  to take action and if law enforcement continues to do that and on a
[1:18:41.200 --> 1:18:47.560]  federalized basis will call it well they can expect that they're probably gonna
[1:18:47.560 --> 1:18:52.240]  have problems absolutely and I think that's really why they're going after
[1:18:52.240 --> 1:18:56.120]  the internet right now so openly so publicly not only do we have the cyber
[1:18:56.120 --> 1:19:00.320]  security act that has been introduced by J. Rockefeller but we've got this one
[1:19:00.320 --> 1:19:06.280]  HR 1966 which is the cyber bullying prevention act let me just let me just
[1:19:06.280 --> 1:19:11.160]  read you a subsection of this section to findings subsection 6 60 percent of
[1:19:11.160 --> 1:19:13.840]  mental health professionals who responded to the survey of internet
[1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:17.600]  mental health issues report that the that are the treated at least one patient
[1:19:17.600 --> 1:19:22.640]  with problematic internet experience in the previous five years so in five
[1:19:22.640 --> 1:19:28.520]  years 60 percent not even a hundred percent treated one patient with
[1:19:28.520 --> 1:19:33.600]  problematic internet experiences people have problems Bob you know people get
[1:19:33.600 --> 1:19:36.320]  depressed on their own I don't see what the internet has anything to do with it
[1:19:36.320 --> 1:19:41.240]  and they're saying 54% of these clients were under the age of 18 we have to save
[1:19:41.240 --> 1:19:47.120]  the children I want to get his take on HR 1966 when we come back it's the Alex

[1:24:39.160 --> 1:24:44.160]  folks where is the love on this cyberbullying act let me define what
[1:24:44.160 --> 1:24:47.560]  cyberbullying is and then we're gonna go to Bob Chapman and get his take on it
[1:24:47.560 --> 1:24:52.600]  section 881 cyberbullying section a whoever transmits an interstate or
[1:24:52.600 --> 1:24:57.280]  foreign commerce any communication with the intent to coerce intimidate
[1:24:57.280 --> 1:25:02.440]  harass or cause substantial emotional distress to a person using electronic
[1:25:02.440 --> 1:25:06.640]  means to support severe repeated and hostile behavior shall be fined under
[1:25:06.640 --> 1:25:11.880]  this title or imprisoned for not more than two years or both so they want to
[1:25:11.880 --> 1:25:16.200]  throw you in jail for two years and fine you for having a different opinion than
[1:25:16.200 --> 1:25:21.040]  someone on the internet who might have their feelings her bob
[1:25:21.040 --> 1:25:26.720]  well i think it's tragic other people's feelings have been and will continue to
[1:25:26.720 --> 1:25:34.240]  be hurt but it certainly by being thrown in jail makes it a felony and i don't
[1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:39.080]  think that's an appropriate sentence for someone who says something that
[1:25:39.080 --> 1:25:42.200]  somebody else doesn't like well isn't that the first amendment aren't we
[1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:45.520]  supposed to be able to dissent bob i mean that's the whole point of this
[1:25:45.520 --> 1:25:51.120]  country that unpopular ideas can be expressed without the threat of jail or
[1:25:51.120 --> 1:25:54.320]  it or fines i mean that's what the first amendment is about and now they're
[1:25:54.320 --> 1:25:58.440]  trying to take that away on the internet as they try to further regulate it
[1:25:58.440 --> 1:26:03.200]  well that's absolutely correct and they'll go they're going to be relentless
[1:26:03.200 --> 1:26:07.200]  they're not going to stop they'll be there with their bushel baskets of
[1:26:07.200 --> 1:26:11.960]  hundred dollar bills giving it out to the people in congress and along with
[1:26:11.960 --> 1:26:19.520]  their lobbying people and their campaign contributions and the jobs here and
[1:26:19.520 --> 1:26:24.760]  there and after you leave your office should be the president of xyz
[1:26:24.760 --> 1:26:29.240]  foundation and and your you know wife and children will be taken care of and
[1:26:29.240 --> 1:26:32.200]  and they're going to they're going to do it they're going to they're going to keep
[1:26:32.200 --> 1:26:37.760]  on pressing and until they eventually shut us down and so what we have to do
[1:26:37.760 --> 1:26:42.520]  number one is inform the public of what they're trying to do get after congress
[1:26:42.520 --> 1:26:48.000]  to see if it'll do any good and prepare people that is going to come a day
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:53.240]  perhaps well we're not going to be on the air yeah i mean and that's what this
[1:26:53.240 --> 1:26:57.880]  is about i mean again they shut down the alex jones channel 18 months up 30
[1:26:57.880 --> 1:27:02.360]  million views combined i mean you look at the obama deception it's almost at 2
[1:27:02.360 --> 1:27:07.280]  million views one copy alone people call into this show every day talking about
[1:27:07.280 --> 1:27:10.920]  the hundreds and thousands of obama deceptions that they've copied and
[1:27:10.920 --> 1:27:15.120]  given to other people i'm getting calls every night on my radio show hey jason i
[1:27:15.120 --> 1:27:18.960]  just woke up last month someone gave me a copy the obama deception hey jason i
[1:27:18.960 --> 1:27:22.240]  just woke up two weeks ago i got turned on your show after i typed the obama
[1:27:22.240 --> 1:27:26.280]  deception into youtube and i came across the info order they don't like that
[1:27:26.280 --> 1:27:30.280]  we're having an impact and now that there is a democratic administration in
[1:27:30.280 --> 1:27:37.720]  that we're waking up the right wing and we are yeah i mean it's incredible to
[1:27:37.720 --> 1:27:42.360]  everybody you know it you know everybody cares about their life cares
[1:27:42.360 --> 1:27:46.360]  about their family cares about the country in which they live that's just not
[1:27:46.360 --> 1:27:51.280]  america i mean there are people listening to these broadcasts all over the
[1:27:51.280 --> 1:27:55.880]  world and they don't want to lose what they have they don't want to become
[1:27:55.880 --> 1:28:00.720]  slaves of the illuminati they don't want to be told what to do they don't want to
[1:28:00.720 --> 1:28:06.320]  be told they can't plant things on their farms they can't fish for certain fish
[1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:14.120]  they can't be a carpenter or whatever and that's what the new world order wants
[1:28:14.120 --> 1:28:19.400]  and we're getting that word out to them and you know it's it's it you know
[1:28:19.400 --> 1:28:30.640]  jason and just the last year this whole information program that we have has
[1:28:30.640 --> 1:28:36.360]  exploded throughout the world people's minds were open because they knew
[1:28:36.360 --> 1:28:40.720]  something wasn't wrong and alex and you and others like you have filled that
[1:28:40.720 --> 1:28:44.960]  void well you know we're going to continue to do so no matter what they
[1:28:44.960 --> 1:28:48.720]  rule on whether they passed these ludicrous bills or not i mean we had
[1:28:48.720 --> 1:28:52.920]  that malicious attack last week after we exposed you know baxter and the
[1:28:52.920 --> 1:28:57.320]  vaccinations and the swine flu really as a hoax we i'm not going to say who we
[1:28:57.320 --> 1:29:00.760]  got a cease and desist letter from but let's say a let's just say our biggest
[1:29:00.760 --> 1:29:04.920]  internet attack ever came directly after that we're not hyping it folks i came
[1:29:04.920 --> 1:29:08.720]  in here i couldn't get on info wars it get it got up just before my show but
[1:29:08.720 --> 1:29:12.600]  then in the middle of my show totally and completely gone on the other side bob

[1:34:08.960 --> 1:34:14.400]  Jason was sitting in his old we've got Bob Chapman with us we're gonna bring
[1:34:14.400 --> 1:34:19.240]  Ted Anderson up in about ten minutes but Bob why don't you tell people how
[1:34:19.240 --> 1:34:25.080]  important it is to get into golden silver in order to really you know save
[1:34:25.080 --> 1:34:28.760]  your wealth try to have something after this economic collapse really had your
[1:34:28.760 --> 1:34:37.000]  bets well let's go to the conclusion the conclusion is where else can you go
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:43.080]  historically when you've had a depression like we're in in this stage it's an
[1:34:43.080 --> 1:34:48.320]  inflationary one and probably will go into hyperinflation and then that'll be
[1:34:48.320 --> 1:34:56.360]  followed by a deflationary depression which is dreadful if you look back at
[1:34:56.360 --> 1:35:02.480]  other times that this has happened you'll see that everything else went down
[1:35:02.480 --> 1:35:08.240]  in value except gold sometimes silver would go down because it's basically a
[1:35:08.240 --> 1:35:15.000]  commercial metal but gold will hold its own in fact it may even appreciate during
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:19.520]  that period of time dependent upon the events of Gold goes a $2,000 an ounce
[1:35:19.520 --> 1:35:26.680]  then gold will appreciate as will all the coins and the bars and the shares
[1:35:26.680 --> 1:35:34.000]  etc at the same time we've already witnessed one fall in the stock market
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:41.800]  which was about 50 to 60% back in 2000 and 2001 we've witnessed the fall and
[1:35:41.800 --> 1:35:50.120]  the median price of housing which is somewhere around 30% and the experts
[1:35:50.120 --> 1:35:56.200]  say it'll get on another 20% so let's say the median house goes down 40% 45%
[1:35:56.200 --> 1:36:01.040]  that's not very good and commercial real estate they say is going to get out 70%
[1:36:01.040 --> 1:36:10.000]  so then we come to the stock market we saw 6600 on the Dow it's 8500 why is it
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:14.320]  there it's there because they don't want it could to get out anymore at this time
[1:36:14.320 --> 1:36:19.200]  so the working group and financial markets under the US Treasury steps in
[1:36:19.200 --> 1:36:24.520]  and manipulates the market and one of the strong reasons for that was to raise
[1:36:24.520 --> 1:36:30.880]  equity money for the financial firms that are all bankrupt now they got the
[1:36:30.880 --> 1:36:34.200]  stress test they explained earlier doesn't mean anything because they're
[1:36:34.200 --> 1:36:42.360]  lying about everything and here we have prices on the stocks of financial
[1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:47.320]  companies that have doubled and tripled in the last two or three weeks well
[1:36:47.320 --> 1:36:51.280]  that's all part of it and they wanted this run-up so they could go sell shares
[1:36:51.280 --> 1:36:58.160]  the suckers and after they finished doing that very shortly the stock markets
[1:36:58.160 --> 1:37:04.000]  going back down again and when it goes down it'll affect any shares that you
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:09.760]  have any with the exception of gold and silver shares it will affect all of the
[1:37:09.760 --> 1:37:15.440]  pensions and profit sharing and IRAs that that's what you get your investments
[1:37:15.440 --> 1:37:21.440]  in it will affect bonds as well because the 30-year bond and the 10-year note
[1:37:21.440 --> 1:37:27.640]  have just broken down below their 200-day moving averages which is not good
[1:37:27.640 --> 1:37:33.960]  and bond yields have started to climb and when yields climb the value of the
[1:37:33.960 --> 1:37:39.720]  bond bond falls so if you have in some portfolio that you have you have bonds
[1:37:39.720 --> 1:37:46.200]  you're starting to lose money on them from what they were before so we can't
[1:37:46.200 --> 1:37:51.800]  go to real estate either kind we can't go to the stock market we can't go to
[1:37:51.800 --> 1:37:59.240]  bonds Jason I don't know where else to go but golden silver and as you said and
[1:37:59.240 --> 1:38:06.560]  I've said often we're looking at 6,000 years of history when immutable gold has
[1:38:06.560 --> 1:38:11.320]  been the only real currency in the world and we have a lock on wealth
[1:38:11.320 --> 1:38:17.880]  preservation by by owning gold in golden silver when we have the inflationary
[1:38:17.880 --> 1:38:22.480]  environment exactly and a lot of people like to say oh golden silver don't have
[1:38:22.480 --> 1:38:26.760]  any inherent value and I'm like well why is it that throughout history it's been
[1:38:26.760 --> 1:38:31.920]  used and sought after I can't see that going away how can people go where should
[1:38:31.920 --> 1:38:38.080]  people go to get golden silver right now they go to Midas that's where they
[1:38:38.080 --> 1:38:44.760]  should go I mean Ted Anderson breaks his neck putting all these programs on
[1:38:44.760 --> 1:38:50.400]  telling the people in the world what's going on and he funds that by having
[1:38:50.400 --> 1:38:55.640]  Midas which sells gold and silver coins and bars and so on and you know I heard
[1:38:55.640 --> 1:38:59.520]  Ted this morning on you know I'm into shock jock radio I've been a big fan of
[1:38:59.520 --> 1:39:03.400]  Howard Stern for years and years and years and you know he's on serious he's
[1:39:03.400 --> 1:39:07.120]  on XM and you know the commercial he was running today that I was listening to
[1:39:07.120 --> 1:39:11.240]  he was basically selling the creature from Jekyll Island in a silver piece but
[1:39:11.240 --> 1:39:14.720]  doing so in a manner that will bring new people in he didn't say the title of the
[1:39:14.720 --> 1:39:18.560]  book he just said what was in the book he said you get this silver piece and then
[1:39:18.560 --> 1:39:24.120]  he quoted Ron Paul as supporting the book and that Ted is a genius I mean we
[1:39:24.120 --> 1:39:27.640]  need more people to be brought into this information and the creature from
[1:39:27.640 --> 1:39:32.840]  Jekyll Island is a great tool to wake people up to what's going on with this
[1:39:32.840 --> 1:39:38.360]  fiat currency and where it basically started where its roots come from
[1:39:38.360 --> 1:39:44.280]  well you're absolutely correct this is at the very heart the very genesis of our
[1:39:44.280 --> 1:39:49.400]  problem not only in America but in other countries where they have the same
[1:39:49.400 --> 1:39:57.400]  kind of central bank privately owned setup and we have to stop it I remember
[1:39:57.400 --> 1:40:02.080]  when I was living in the Bahamas and one of the bank has said to me well the
[1:40:02.080 --> 1:40:06.680]  British on the central bank I said you got to be kidding me of course the
[1:40:06.680 --> 1:40:13.800]  British left what 35 40 years ago you know legally so to speak and and I said
[1:40:13.800 --> 1:40:20.400]  I don't believe it and he said yes and so that has to stop the bank have that
[1:40:20.400 --> 1:40:25.440]  run countries have to belong to the government and it's been a long fight
[1:40:25.440 --> 1:40:32.720]  in America over this between Alexander Hamilton and then Andrew Jackson and it
[1:40:32.720 --> 1:40:36.000]  was probably one of the greatest presidents because he saved us from the
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:44.040]  bankers at least for a period of time and and so this is the big fight the fight
[1:40:44.040 --> 1:40:51.520]  against the bankers the fight against fractional banking of 40 and 50 and 60
[1:40:51.520 --> 1:40:58.080]  times I mean that is absolutely incredible and if you want to arm yourself
[1:40:58.080 --> 1:41:02.080]  against gambling like wild men and if you want to arm yourself against these
[1:41:02.080 --> 1:41:05.440]  people the best way to do so is go to minus resources and here is the man
[1:41:05.440 --> 1:41:10.680]  himself behind minus resources Ted Anderson how you doing today Ted
[1:41:10.680 --> 1:41:15.560]  how much of a genius I am when I'm just following Thomas Jefferson I think he's
[1:41:15.560 --> 1:41:19.560]  the genius and of course the people of Virginia that were supporting him at the
[1:41:19.560 --> 1:41:23.880]  time when the Union was being formed I mean one of the few groups that had the
[1:41:23.880 --> 1:41:30.680]  sense to stand up and say hey if you don't introduce to this constitutional
[1:41:30.680 --> 1:41:37.200]  agreement between the states the Bill of Rights we will not join the Union and we
[1:41:37.200 --> 1:41:41.880]  also hold and reserve the right to separate ourselves from this Union and
[1:41:41.880 --> 1:41:45.920]  have the ultimate veto authority over the Federation which where they're
[1:41:45.920 --> 1:41:49.600]  forming and I don't know why I mean it's nice to see that there are a few
[1:41:49.600 --> 1:41:54.120]  people that are recognizing that it's the few states that are recognizing that
[1:41:54.120 --> 1:42:01.480]  and are considering the the departure of the United States Union and and therefore
[1:42:01.480 --> 1:42:07.440]  taking away the power from the the Congress and the President of the
[1:42:07.440 --> 1:42:10.960]  United States it's just one of the things that I'm passionate about it but
[1:42:10.960 --> 1:42:15.360]  you're right and I appreciate you bringing that up about about that
[1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:19.480]  commercial that you heard earlier it's always been my passion not necessarily
[1:42:19.480 --> 1:42:24.160]  become some rich eccentric billionaire because I'm selling gold and silver
[1:42:24.160 --> 1:42:29.680]  because just about everything I get I turn over to try to educate and and and
[1:42:29.680 --> 1:42:35.720]  and forward the the well the best thing about it that is you're not preaching to
[1:42:35.720 --> 1:42:39.360]  the choir you're trying to bring in people who were like me before I was
[1:42:39.360 --> 1:42:42.640]  awake people who listen to this stuff and that's really the only talk radio
[1:42:42.640 --> 1:42:46.720]  they listen to they may not be the most hip to politics they may not know that
[1:42:46.720 --> 1:42:49.960]  it's a false left-right paradigm they may still be listening to
[1:42:49.960 --> 1:42:54.720]  Hannity Glenn Beck Rush Limbaugh and you're able to put these commercials out
[1:42:54.720 --> 1:42:58.960]  there hopefully get customers to come in read this book and open minds and that
[1:42:58.960 --> 1:43:03.120]  gets them to listen to GCN live Alex Jones my program and other great
[1:43:03.120 --> 1:43:07.720]  programs on the network and it only strengthens our cause well that's that's
[1:43:07.720 --> 1:43:10.880]  the whole point I mean if we can wake the people up and we don't have to have a
[1:43:10.880 --> 1:43:15.720]  hundred percent but if we can bring enough sound-minded people to this
[1:43:15.720 --> 1:43:22.680]  argument and it is so neat to see this last presidential election to be
[1:43:22.680 --> 1:43:28.880]  influenced by by Ron Paul and have a good percentage of the people out there
[1:43:28.880 --> 1:43:36.320]  supporting the the the dismissal of the Federal Reserve System and fiat currency
[1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:43.360]  you know yesterday we talked about the Lakota coin at $17.71 and I don't
[1:43:43.360 --> 1:43:48.240]  know if people were buying those things like crazy because of the fact that it's
[1:43:48.240 --> 1:43:52.560]  silver such a great buy at this time or because people knew that the Lakota
[1:43:52.560 --> 1:43:57.320]  nation is flying in the face of the Federal Reserve System and putting a
[1:43:57.320 --> 1:44:02.040]  $50 number on that thing and they're a sovereign nation and I'm sure that they
[1:44:02.040 --> 1:44:05.520]  have the right to have their own currency and therefore the United States
[1:44:05.520 --> 1:44:09.000]  people at least the people that listen to the Alex Jones show would like to
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:13.320]  support such a thing they did go up in price we did sell out the supplier
[1:44:13.320 --> 1:44:18.800]  and like Alex said they did go up in price they're at $19.66 obviously a
[1:44:18.800 --> 1:44:23.240]  very steep discount to what they're trading for if you look on eBay and that
[1:44:23.240 --> 1:44:29.680]  kind of thing still but yet still a very a very solid response to that coin and
[1:44:29.680 --> 1:44:35.320]  it just makes me smile I have to say real quick here there are a few coins
[1:44:35.320 --> 1:44:42.120]  left that I accumulated when silver was down there at that $11.50 level one of
[1:44:42.120 --> 1:44:46.680]  them is that Franklin coin and they're still at $8.69 still the same price I
[1:44:46.680 --> 1:44:52.040]  had them for yesterday in gold the best buys that I have are the Franks at $214
[1:44:52.040 --> 1:44:57.200]  and the British sovereign at $267 Franks should really literally are priced right
[1:44:57.200 --> 1:45:02.880]  now at that $229 level which $214 is obviously a very steep discount to that
[1:45:02.880 --> 1:45:07.760]  British sovereigns are at $267 I don't think you can find a better
[1:45:07.760 --> 1:45:11.680]  buyout in the marketplace right now other than the coins that I have left
[1:45:11.680 --> 1:45:17.080]  over from when you know I mean silver sovers at $14 an ounce now gold it
[1:45:17.080 --> 1:45:22.760]  right now is in the 900s and obviously with gold at 286 silver at $11.50 I
[1:45:22.760 --> 1:45:26.080]  was able to make some pretty good buys and I would suggest that people take
[1:45:26.080 --> 1:45:29.680]  advantage of them exactly when they call up Midas resources and you're gonna
[1:45:29.680 --> 1:45:32.740]  give out the number in a moment make sure to mention you heard it here on
[1:45:32.740 --> 1:45:36.080]  Alex Jones so you can get all the greatest discounts from Ted Ted why
[1:45:36.080 --> 1:45:43.680]  don't you give out the number yeah the numbers 800 686 2237 again it's 1800
[1:45:43.680 --> 1:45:54.600]  686 2237 I'll say it one more time 1800 686 2237 Bob you're you're just making
[1:45:54.600 --> 1:46:00.720]  such a strong and solid point and talking about the the fiat currency system
[1:46:00.720 --> 1:46:04.240]  that we have now and the arguments that go all the way back to Hamilton and
[1:46:04.240 --> 1:46:10.880]  Thomas Jefferson and and and the people from Virginia back in the the 1700s
[1:46:10.880 --> 1:46:17.080]  when this nation was being formed and and Andrew Jackson there was I mean
[1:46:17.080 --> 1:46:21.880]  there's such a there's a there's a article you can Google it's called the
[1:46:21.880 --> 1:46:26.000]  what is it's the monster from Jesus I can't even I don't have it here off the
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:30.840]  top of my head it's on the it's on the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank website
[1:46:30.840 --> 1:46:34.640]  I'll just pull it out here in a little bit I'll be able to give you it's the
[1:46:34.640 --> 1:46:38.960]  monster from Chestnut Street and that was Biddle's Bank back and back in their
[1:46:38.960 --> 1:46:44.600]  early 1800s in the fight between Biddle and and Andrew Jackson which actually
[1:46:44.600 --> 1:46:51.160]  ended up you know the the Biddle actually tightened up the money supply to
[1:46:51.160 --> 1:46:55.020]  the point where it caused a depression at that particular time because Andrew
[1:46:55.020 --> 1:47:00.240]  Jackson was stepping in and trying to close down that banking system way too
[1:47:00.240 --> 1:47:04.520]  much power being handed to a private agency and the argument that they're
[1:47:04.520 --> 1:47:07.400]  saying with the Federal Reserve System because there's a board of governors
[1:47:07.400 --> 1:47:11.360]  there's many different banks rather than one that control the system that it's
[1:47:11.360 --> 1:47:14.560]  different and I'm saying it's not different at all there's a few people
[1:47:14.560 --> 1:47:18.920]  that are able to siphon off the wealth of the nation every time we go to work we
[1:47:18.920 --> 1:47:24.720]  pay close to 40% depending upon where you're at in the tax bracket and taxes
[1:47:24.720 --> 1:47:28.560]  that wealth just gets siphoned right into the hands of these few individuals and
[1:47:28.560 --> 1:47:32.640]  that's why you see this elite group that's able to control not only just the
[1:47:32.640 --> 1:47:36.960]  United States but the world so if there is one point that I can make here
[1:47:36.960 --> 1:47:42.600]  supporting Alex Jones his Obama deception and the many great documentaries
[1:47:42.600 --> 1:47:48.840]  that he's done is that if we can stop this central banking system from being
[1:47:48.840 --> 1:47:53.680]  able to siphon that wealth away from the people they will lose the very engine
[1:47:53.680 --> 1:47:58.840]  that that the very mechanism that gives them the power to do this that is the
[1:47:58.840 --> 1:48:03.600]  only way to stop them if you pass laws if you take away their wealth but leave
[1:48:03.600 --> 1:48:07.480]  them with the central banking system they will buy in all their power right
[1:48:07.480 --> 1:48:10.960]  back again and it'll just be turned right back into the system that we're
[1:48:10.960 --> 1:48:14.280]  that we're living in with a with a different face and a different design
[1:48:14.280 --> 1:48:19.160]  I mean just because we have a black man for president doesn't mean that the
[1:48:19.160 --> 1:48:23.960]  the system that we're living in has changed it just has a new face that's all
[1:48:23.960 --> 1:48:28.280]  and it's still the same economic controls being being handed down by the same
[1:48:28.280 --> 1:48:33.680]  group and it just it simply has to stop if we want to have liberty in this
[1:48:33.680 --> 1:48:38.120]  nation if that's what the United States is about having individual liberty then
[1:48:38.120 --> 1:48:42.320]  your best in this Federal Reserve system and the only thing I can say is if the
[1:48:42.320 --> 1:48:47.040]  United States isn't smart enough to get back on to a gold standard we the
[1:48:47.040 --> 1:48:51.520]  people of the United States of America better put ourselves on a gold standard
[1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:55.000]  and that's why I'm suggesting these British sovereigns and Frank's you need
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:48:59.280]  to move and you need to move now because tarp and all these different government
[1:48:59.280 --> 1:49:02.800]  bailouts it's all about turning on a printing press and when they run that
[1:49:02.800 --> 1:49:06.280]  printing press they're taking money from us and they're not even showing up at
[1:49:06.280 --> 1:49:09.840]  our door they're stealing our wealth away from us and you better do something
[1:49:09.840 --> 1:49:14.160]  about it if you're sitting in a 401k plan or if you have an IRA sitting in the
[1:49:14.160 --> 1:49:18.240]  stock market if you have annuities if you see have money in the bank if you're
[1:49:18.240 --> 1:49:22.520]  invested in the stock market in the real estate market it doesn't seem to matter
[1:49:22.520 --> 1:49:26.480]  you better have yourselves your hands and something that's held value for
[1:49:26.480 --> 1:49:30.200]  thousands and thousands of years and gold and silver it just happens to be the
[1:49:30.200 --> 1:49:34.800]  item that makes that work exactly folks if you truly want to empower yourself and
[1:49:34.800 --> 1:49:39.560]  get beyond this control grid you need to go to Midas Resources right now get some
[1:49:39.560 --> 1:49:43.560]  gold get some silver what's the number one more time Ted the number is 1-800
[1:49:43.560 --> 1:49:49.840]  686-2237 again please mention that you've heard it on the Alex Jones show
[1:49:49.840 --> 1:49:54.200]  otherwise you're gonna have to pay today's prices yesterday if people went
[1:49:54.200 --> 1:49:58.600]  to buy the the Lakota rounds from us and you didn't mention that you heard it on
[1:49:58.600 --> 1:50:05.840]  the Alex Jones show you had to pay $19.66 instead of $17.71 the time
[1:50:05.840 --> 1:50:10.520]  is now to move you can see it it's as plain as the nose on your face that the
[1:50:10.520 --> 1:50:14.640]  economic system here in the United States is failing I mean even the people in
[1:50:14.640 --> 1:50:20.200]  China who are who are socialistic communists and live in a totalitarian
[1:50:20.200 --> 1:50:24.760]  regime understand that gold is more valuable than the United States paper
[1:50:24.760 --> 1:50:29.280]  currency and they're raising their reserves over 78% from just a couple
[1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:34.120]  years ago they want to get into have get into having real money so call us at

[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:30.120]  we have breaking news coming from Randall Terry who founded the pro-life
[1:54:30.120 --> 1:54:34.080]  organization operation rescue and is currently heading up stop Obama
[1:54:34.080 --> 1:54:39.200]  Notre Dame it's concerning political figure Alan Keyes Randall give us the
[1:54:39.200 --> 1:54:44.200]  news Alan Keyes and over 20 other pro-life people are sitting behind bars
[1:54:44.200 --> 1:54:48.880]  right now most of them will spend the weekend in jail and the reason is
[1:54:48.880 --> 1:54:53.080]  because Notre Dame who claims to want dialogue over the killing of be the
[1:54:53.080 --> 1:54:58.040]  innocent arrested them what they did was they walked on campus quietly
[1:54:58.040 --> 1:55:04.480]  peacefully praying with baby strollers with dolls in them covered with stage
[1:55:04.480 --> 1:55:11.000]  blood as a testimony of what president Obama is doing and the police
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:15.040]  corral them all in the room in jail they're in jail right now well I'm sure
[1:55:15.040 --> 1:55:20.200]  that you've seen this latest domestic extremism lexicon from the DHS and
[1:55:20.200 --> 1:55:25.360]  right here in the second page anti-abortionist extremism a movement
[1:55:25.360 --> 1:55:28.880]  of groups are individuals who are virally anti-abortion advocate violence
[1:55:28.880 --> 1:55:32.760]  obviously are violent against providers of abortion related services their
[1:55:32.760 --> 1:55:37.120]  employees and their facilities on also on some say various racist and
[1:55:37.120 --> 1:55:41.000]  anti-semitic beliefs to justify their criminal activity so they're trying to
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:45.160]  lump you in with violent criminals who are anti-semitic how do you feel about
[1:55:45.160 --> 1:55:49.960]  that well there's nothing like having false witness born against you
[1:55:49.960 --> 1:55:53.520]  obviously you can see what a great threat it is to have baby carriages
[1:55:53.520 --> 1:55:56.440]  carrying baby dolls but but let's go a step beyond this
[1:55:56.440 --> 1:56:00.040]  this is not just a federal government saying that we're bad people
[1:56:00.040 --> 1:56:05.880]  this is Notre Dame a Catholic college who has put people in jail for defending
[1:56:05.880 --> 1:56:06.480]  life
[1:56:06.480 --> 1:56:11.000]  and they're going to honor a man whose policies kill life
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:15.600]  I mean that the irony in the perversion could not be more stark
[1:56:15.600 --> 1:56:21.040]  so here's our goal I know we are time is limited our goal is to have over one
[1:56:21.040 --> 1:56:23.600]  hundred people arrested over the next seven days
[1:56:23.600 --> 1:56:26.840]  and if we can have thirty or forty or fifty people
[1:56:26.840 --> 1:56:31.240]  sitting in jail here at the weekend where Obama is speaking
[1:56:31.240 --> 1:56:35.720]  that will make international news well tell people how they do that
[1:56:35.720 --> 1:56:39.920]  people say I wish the pope could hear my voice listen go to jail hear your voice

[2:01:14.120 --> 2:01:17.840]  you don't have to agree with every point to see that something is going on here
[2:01:17.840 --> 2:01:20.000]  and they're just so well researched and well done
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:23.640]  uh... it's really comparable to something that the history channel would put out
[2:01:23.640 --> 2:01:26.300]  so it's very digestible for people that don't
[2:01:26.300 --> 2:01:28.160]  know about this information

[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:58.280]  is on the back of the dollar bill how it got there and so much more
[2:01:58.280 --> 2:02:01.080]  what do you tell people how you got started on this entire series because
[2:02:01.080 --> 2:02:02.040]  it's almost
[2:02:02.040 --> 2:02:05.440]  uh... complete it's almost nine hours long i would i would guess probably eight
[2:02:05.440 --> 2:02:08.680]  hours and thirty minutes eight hours and fifteen minutes somewhere around there
[2:02:08.680 --> 2:02:12.720]  and it is it is a one of a kind series
[2:02:12.720 --> 2:02:16.280]  yeah it's uh... you know i i've been studying uh...
[2:02:16.280 --> 2:02:20.200]  in new world order information for close to ten years now
[2:02:20.200 --> 2:02:23.440]  and i'm making documentaries about it and
[2:02:23.440 --> 2:02:27.280]  uh... what i was doing some of the early research on the new world order i came
[2:02:27.280 --> 2:02:30.640]  across this whole doctrine about america
[2:02:30.640 --> 2:02:32.240]  as the new atlantis
[2:02:32.240 --> 2:02:35.360]  and this information about the frances bacon
[2:02:35.360 --> 2:02:39.400]  and this plan supposedly that went back thousands of years that
[2:02:39.400 --> 2:02:43.920]  looks to the ancient philosophers like play-doh and pathagoras and others
[2:02:43.920 --> 2:02:48.160]  and that uh... this plan had somehow rather than handed down
[2:02:48.160 --> 2:02:52.280]  over the centuries at least this is what's believed by certain writers
[2:02:52.280 --> 2:02:54.200]  uh... of arcane war
[2:02:54.200 --> 2:02:58.680]  and that it was picked up by uh... frances bacon and doctor john d
[2:02:58.680 --> 2:03:02.000]  in england during the reign of queen Elizabeth the first
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:07.400]  and that they had this vision when america was discovered
[2:03:07.400 --> 2:03:11.440]  when uh... you know columbus makes its discovery in fourteen ninety two
[2:03:11.440 --> 2:03:14.720]  and then this knowledge now of this uh...
[2:03:14.720 --> 2:03:16.320]  of this new world
[2:03:16.320 --> 2:03:17.720]  comes to europe
[2:03:17.720 --> 2:03:22.160]  men like bacon believed that what they had really discovered was the lost
[2:03:22.160 --> 2:03:23.120]  continent
[2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:24.440]  of atlantis
[2:03:24.440 --> 2:03:28.440]  uh... not symbolically or metaphorically they didn't believe atlantis was
[2:03:28.440 --> 2:03:30.620]  you know beneath the ocean at some
[2:03:30.620 --> 2:03:34.040]  on the discovery channel and so on your scuba divers going
[2:03:34.040 --> 2:03:37.760]  looking up under the water they believe that this continent that you and i are
[2:03:37.760 --> 2:03:38.760]  sitting on
[2:03:38.760 --> 2:03:42.360]  that this was the site of ancient atlantis
[2:03:42.360 --> 2:03:44.200]  and they believe that it was
[2:03:44.200 --> 2:03:47.000]  you know mystical it was symbolic
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:50.720]  that there was a reason why the god if you will
[2:03:50.720 --> 2:03:53.120]  had revealed it to mankind
[2:03:53.120 --> 2:03:55.600]  and that from this
[2:03:55.600 --> 2:03:56.560]  uh...
[2:03:56.560 --> 2:04:00.300]  uh... a meal mankind would have a new beginning
[2:04:00.300 --> 2:04:03.200]  and would somehow rather resurrect
[2:04:03.200 --> 2:04:04.280]  the
[2:04:04.280 --> 2:04:06.600]  you know the uh... ancient atlantis
[2:04:06.600 --> 2:04:09.200]  uh... which according to legends and so on
[2:04:09.200 --> 2:04:13.040]  was not just a city but it or an island but it was
[2:04:13.040 --> 2:04:17.560]  uh... uh... a commonwealth that extended to all the world ultimately
[2:04:17.560 --> 2:04:19.780]  atlantis rained over the whole
[2:04:19.780 --> 2:04:22.720]  or that that time or at least according to the legends
[2:04:22.720 --> 2:04:24.760]  and so they envisioned
[2:04:24.760 --> 2:04:27.200]  a new atlantis going forth
[2:04:27.200 --> 2:04:30.160]  uh... that would be based on these new philosophic
[2:04:30.160 --> 2:04:33.320]  ideas that uh... that bacon had
[2:04:33.320 --> 2:04:38.720]  and that this would ultimately end up the world and out into a global society
[2:04:38.720 --> 2:04:43.880]  yet develop into what they call their ideal system the new world order
[2:04:43.880 --> 2:04:47.600]  again that's a phrase and a term that they use and we report on will be back
[2:04:47.600 --> 2:04:48.800]  after this

[2:08:36.480 --> 2:08:38.760]  all of these really touch on
[2:08:38.760 --> 2:08:45.120]  similar ideas and it progresses but that one idea of the creation of this new
[2:08:45.120 --> 2:08:50.000]  global governance this new world order uh... you refer to it as possibly world
[2:08:50.000 --> 2:08:53.600]  democracy you get into masonry secret societies

[2:09:10.080 --> 2:09:13.560]  of you know people like benjamin franklin and queen elizabeth
[2:09:13.560 --> 2:09:14.920]  who are featured
[2:09:14.920 --> 2:09:18.960]  and the first one of these uh... the new atlantis
[2:09:18.960 --> 2:09:23.080]  well queen elizabeth she's uh... very interesting character i mean she she
[2:09:23.080 --> 2:09:25.840]  preferred the and you know at the time the
[2:09:25.840 --> 2:09:30.080]  the politics of england were very much protest in england against catholic
[2:09:30.080 --> 2:09:30.980]  europe
[2:09:30.980 --> 2:09:32.840]  and the pope had excommunicated
[2:09:32.840 --> 2:09:33.960]  elizabeth
[2:09:33.960 --> 2:09:34.920]  uh...
[2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:38.880]  and uh... it was trying to have her assassinated basically
[2:09:38.880 --> 2:09:42.360]  and so you had all of these spies you had jesuit you had
[2:09:42.360 --> 2:09:44.000]  uh... very zealous
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:47.560]  catholics who according to the catholic doctor at that time
[2:09:47.560 --> 2:09:50.960]  if a monarch were excommunicated by the pope
[2:09:50.960 --> 2:09:56.000]  then catholics who were faithful had a responsibility not to obey that monarch
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:09:58.360]  first and second to try and kill them
[2:09:58.360 --> 2:10:02.760]  and so this created you know uh... a climate of potential assassination
[2:10:02.760 --> 2:10:04.400]  around elizabeth
[2:10:04.400 --> 2:10:06.880]  so what happened was the english
[2:10:06.880 --> 2:10:12.160]  formed uh... a number of groups at least one in particular the rose accrucian
[2:10:12.160 --> 2:10:16.800]  uh... who formed around elizabeth to protect her from the assassination
[2:10:16.800 --> 2:10:18.640]  so they developed a
[2:10:18.640 --> 2:10:20.800]  uh... an intelligence network
[2:10:20.800 --> 2:10:22.200]  where they were
[2:10:22.200 --> 2:10:24.320]  uh... involved with
[2:10:24.320 --> 2:10:27.760]  ciphers and secret codes and all the sort of kind of stuff
[2:10:27.760 --> 2:10:31.120]  and bacon and john d in fact john d is the original
[2:10:31.120 --> 2:10:33.040]  agent double o seven
[2:10:33.040 --> 2:10:38.200]  uh... he was uh... the inspiration for in phleming's whole james bond series
[2:10:38.200 --> 2:10:42.120]  because uh... d what sign his correspondence to the queen
[2:10:42.120 --> 2:10:45.360]  double o seven he's also the original
[2:10:45.360 --> 2:10:47.840]  uh... major so wizard
[2:10:47.840 --> 2:10:50.440]  figure uh... that inspired
[2:10:50.440 --> 2:10:53.280]  uh... doctor faustus inspired gandalf
[2:10:53.280 --> 2:10:57.680]  from lord of the rings inspired albus dumbledore from the harry potter books
[2:10:57.680 --> 2:10:58.720]  and so on
[2:10:58.720 --> 2:11:02.360]  uh... so doctor john d is a very interesting character but he was the
[2:11:02.360 --> 2:11:04.280]  queen's astrologer
[2:11:04.280 --> 2:11:06.520]  and he had uh...
[2:11:06.520 --> 2:11:08.640]  he had a powerful influence
[2:11:08.640 --> 2:11:10.160]  over queen elizabeth
[2:11:10.160 --> 2:11:11.920]  and apparently on
[2:11:11.920 --> 2:11:13.720]  sufrances bacon
[2:11:13.720 --> 2:11:16.880]  but d was the head of the rose accrucians for a time
[2:11:16.880 --> 2:11:19.080]  and then he handed off the reins
[2:11:19.080 --> 2:11:20.040]  to bacon
[2:11:20.040 --> 2:11:23.920]  bacon ends up financing the virginia company
[2:11:23.920 --> 2:11:27.560]  uh... heavily financing the virginia company that then comes
[2:11:27.560 --> 2:11:30.440]  to james town in sixteen oh seven
[2:11:30.440 --> 2:11:34.120]  and if you look at the great seal of virginia
[2:11:34.120 --> 2:11:35.200]  uh... today
[2:11:35.200 --> 2:11:39.840]  uh... the seal of virginia has a picture of uh... a female goddess wearing a
[2:11:39.840 --> 2:11:41.720]  helm and a spear
[2:11:41.720 --> 2:11:43.800]  okay and she's got her foot
[2:11:43.800 --> 2:11:48.480]  on the uh... the throne of like a fallen are on the neck of a fallen tyrant
[2:11:48.480 --> 2:11:52.280]  and the goddess if you look at her very carefully they give her another name
[2:11:52.280 --> 2:11:53.600]  but she is
[2:11:53.600 --> 2:11:54.680]  almost a bit
[2:11:54.680 --> 2:11:58.400]  the exact image of palisthenia and palisthenia
[2:11:58.400 --> 2:12:02.560]  was the goddess that francis bacon claimed was his muse
[2:12:02.560 --> 2:12:06.120]  uh... his inspiration so on of wisdom and what not
[2:12:06.120 --> 2:12:10.400]  so now you fast forward into american history a hundred and some odd years
[2:12:10.400 --> 2:12:12.680]  later and you've got benjamin franklin
[2:12:12.680 --> 2:12:16.400]  benjamin franklin was in his day like a
[2:12:16.400 --> 2:12:18.360]  uh... he was uh...
[2:12:18.360 --> 2:12:21.880]  you know a ladder day francis bacon bacon
[2:12:21.880 --> 2:12:25.280]  was the father of the modern scientific method
[2:12:25.280 --> 2:12:29.800]  he developed all of these papers and secret codes had books on them so on
[2:12:29.800 --> 2:12:34.520]  very involved in printing and literature and writing and publishing things and
[2:12:34.520 --> 2:12:35.360]  so on
[2:12:35.360 --> 2:12:39.040]  uh... and benjamin franklin was involved in all the same things a lot of people
[2:12:39.040 --> 2:12:41.840]  don't realize we know you know franklin from
[2:12:41.840 --> 2:12:45.880]  the discovery of electricity but he had a number of scientific inventions that
[2:12:45.880 --> 2:12:46.880]  you know the
[2:12:46.880 --> 2:12:49.120]  uh... the bifocals and so on
[2:12:49.120 --> 2:12:53.080]  uh... but he was very involved in science very involved in writing and
[2:12:53.080 --> 2:12:55.000]  printing even as bacon was
[2:12:55.000 --> 2:12:58.840]  and even published a book on cipher secret codes
[2:12:58.840 --> 2:13:02.520]  but he was during the american revolution
[2:13:02.520 --> 2:13:07.120]  what bacon was during the time of queen elizabeth because bacon was a part of
[2:13:07.120 --> 2:13:10.560]  this whole intelligence network to protect the queen
[2:13:10.560 --> 2:13:13.080]  and franklin was really
[2:13:13.080 --> 2:13:17.720]  the special forces intelligence guy during the american revolution
[2:13:17.720 --> 2:13:21.160]  working on behalf of uh... of america
[2:13:21.160 --> 2:13:22.520]  over in europe
[2:13:22.520 --> 2:13:25.960]  uh... he was uh... it was in france he was in england
[2:13:25.960 --> 2:13:31.560]  he was the member of secret societies in uh... america england and france
[2:13:31.560 --> 2:13:34.320]  the three countries that were all involved
[2:13:34.320 --> 2:13:35.920]  in the american revolution
[2:13:35.920 --> 2:13:40.200]  and these societies by the way are the precursors to today's intelligence
[2:13:40.200 --> 2:13:41.560]  networks i mean that is
[2:13:41.560 --> 2:13:45.400]  that's even mainline i mean in the good shepherd the film by robert nero
[2:13:45.400 --> 2:13:48.200]  starring matt daemon they openly show you
[2:13:48.200 --> 2:13:52.680]  that they used to yell as a recruitment tool for people in skull and bones which
[2:13:52.680 --> 2:13:56.640]  was yet another precursor to these intelligence agencies to bring in the
[2:13:56.640 --> 2:13:59.560]  cia and the ls s
[2:13:59.560 --> 2:14:04.200]  absolutely i mean the uh... the her majesty secret service
[2:14:04.200 --> 2:14:07.800]  you know uh... and i five and i six and all of that
[2:14:07.800 --> 2:14:11.480]  uh... in england was with uh... uh... waltzingham
[2:14:11.480 --> 2:14:13.480]  who was working with
[2:14:13.480 --> 2:14:17.480]  bacon john d all of these guys they've this is how they develop their secret
[2:14:17.480 --> 2:14:19.120]  code system
[2:14:19.120 --> 2:14:23.880]  it's brought to america and from america as you said it it ultimately unfolds
[2:14:23.880 --> 2:14:25.080]  into our
[2:14:25.080 --> 2:14:27.800]  you know the ls s and then the cia today
[2:14:27.800 --> 2:14:31.640]  uh... but it's it's a very interesting history but it's all based on these
[2:14:31.640 --> 2:14:33.320]  secret societies
[2:14:33.320 --> 2:14:36.280]  uh... and uh... and so franklin
[2:14:36.280 --> 2:14:39.800]  was uh... it is very very interesting in fact there are some people who have
[2:14:39.800 --> 2:14:41.000]  written books
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:42.540]  about franklin
[2:14:42.540 --> 2:14:45.520]  calling him a spy master and even questioning
[2:14:45.520 --> 2:14:48.640]  his loyalty to the united states during
[2:14:48.640 --> 2:14:50.360]  the revolutionary war
[2:14:50.360 --> 2:14:53.680]  because he it came out years after the war
[2:14:53.680 --> 2:14:54.840]  that uh...
[2:14:54.840 --> 2:14:57.680]  uh... franklin had a double agent
[2:14:57.680 --> 2:15:01.240]  uh... a british spy that was working on his staff
[2:15:01.240 --> 2:15:04.920]  and he'd been warned about many times but he never did anything
[2:15:04.920 --> 2:15:08.440]  uh... to get rid of the guy and there's actually a book out there called then
[2:15:08.440 --> 2:15:09.640]  franklin
[2:15:09.640 --> 2:15:11.640]  patriot or spy
[2:15:11.640 --> 2:15:12.720]  uh...
[2:15:12.720 --> 2:15:17.000]  and uh... it's called number twenty three ben franklin patriot or spy because
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:18.920]  franklin's code name
[2:15:18.920 --> 2:15:22.400]  with british intelligence was number twenty three
[2:15:22.400 --> 2:15:26.120]  uh... and or number seventy two sorry number seventy two
[2:15:26.120 --> 2:15:29.800]  and he was also called moses that was his other nickname
[2:15:29.800 --> 2:15:34.360]  but franklin was involved with a secret group in england called the hellfire
[2:15:34.360 --> 2:15:35.360]  club
[2:15:35.360 --> 2:15:39.120]  and you mentioned this last time i was on the radio with you jason about
[2:15:39.120 --> 2:15:43.320]  uh... you know franklin the hellfire club and now they found in the nineteen
[2:15:43.320 --> 2:15:44.600]  nineties they
[2:15:44.600 --> 2:15:47.480]  dug up his home there and let in london
[2:15:47.480 --> 2:15:51.920]  and found all of these dead bodies you know that the bones of these cadavers
[2:15:51.920 --> 2:15:52.760]  and so on
[2:15:52.760 --> 2:15:56.480]  and that's why news by the way that's not just me and you talking about it or
[2:15:56.480 --> 2:16:00.600]  some obscure author i think it was like london telegraph or guardian i mean it
[2:16:00.600 --> 2:16:02.920]  was as main line as i could get
[2:16:02.920 --> 2:16:07.600]  yeah in fact today they've got they've turned his home into
[2:16:07.600 --> 2:16:08.740]  a museum
[2:16:08.740 --> 2:16:12.320]  where you can go there and they actually have some of the bones they found
[2:16:12.320 --> 2:16:13.800]  not only the bones of
[2:16:13.800 --> 2:16:15.520]  uh... adults and children
[2:16:15.520 --> 2:16:18.200]  but they found animal bones beneath those
[2:16:18.200 --> 2:16:19.640]  uh... and uh...
[2:16:19.640 --> 2:16:23.520]  if they if i've seen a few pictures of the remains and they look like they're
[2:16:23.520 --> 2:16:26.440]  sort of blackened in places in charred
[2:16:26.440 --> 2:16:28.680]  uh... almost as if they had been burned
[2:16:28.680 --> 2:16:33.280]  and you know one of the things that satanic groups to do they they have a
[2:16:33.280 --> 2:16:36.000]  human sacrifices but they also have
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:38.320]  animal sacrifices as well
[2:16:38.320 --> 2:16:42.600]  and uh... you know we can only wonder their official explanation
[2:16:42.600 --> 2:16:46.480]  is that there was a medical school in franklin's home for like a year and a
[2:16:46.480 --> 2:16:48.040]  half or two years
[2:16:48.040 --> 2:16:50.160]  and that that's where the bodies came from
[2:16:50.160 --> 2:16:51.640]  but uh...
[2:16:51.640 --> 2:16:53.600]  uh... but still he was
[2:16:53.600 --> 2:16:55.480]  you know deeply involved
[2:16:55.480 --> 2:16:57.840]  with this hellfire group
[2:16:57.840 --> 2:17:01.280]  that had been founded by surfrance dashwood
[2:17:01.280 --> 2:17:06.400]  and dashwood was like a close advisor to king george the third
[2:17:06.400 --> 2:17:10.440]  who was the king we were fighting against the american revolution
[2:17:10.440 --> 2:17:14.480]  uh... dashwood was a member of the house of commons the house of lords he was a
[2:17:14.480 --> 2:17:16.000]  prominent member
[2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:20.000]  and there were other political figures that were a part of this
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:24.440]  uh... group of the called themselves the monks of medman and
[2:17:24.440 --> 2:17:25.800]  abbey
[2:17:25.800 --> 2:17:28.340]  their nickname was the hellfire club
[2:17:28.340 --> 2:17:33.920]  and i believe the hellfire club if you study them and what they were into
[2:17:33.920 --> 2:17:39.280]  uh... i believe they were precursor to the bohemian grove club
[2:17:39.280 --> 2:17:43.360]  uh... that you guys exposed in alex jones video you know showing the
[2:17:43.360 --> 2:17:46.000]  uh... the rituals in the bohemian grove
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:48.480]  some of those guys are dressed up
[2:17:48.480 --> 2:17:52.440]  like you know catholic priests and cardinals and so on and with exactly
[2:17:52.440 --> 2:17:53.640]  the head guy
[2:17:53.640 --> 2:17:58.320]  where's what looks like a pope had he's in a long robe and he has himself a
[2:17:58.320 --> 2:17:59.560]  staff as he
[2:17:59.560 --> 2:18:02.720]  gives this very Babylonian guy a worship
[2:18:02.720 --> 2:18:06.760]  uh... ritual and then at the end of the ritual someone rose in on a boat gives
[2:18:06.760 --> 2:18:10.880]  him an effigy of a baby meanwhile there are probably a dozen or so other
[2:18:10.880 --> 2:18:15.560]  gentlemen holding torches in what appear to be druidic like outfits waiting
[2:18:15.560 --> 2:18:16.420]  for this
[2:18:16.420 --> 2:18:21.360]  cremation of care if you will and then they drop the body on this fiery
[2:18:21.360 --> 2:18:26.320]  you know uh... alter in front of the owl god molik this forty foot statue
[2:18:26.320 --> 2:18:29.200]  that's hollowed out and has a little sound system in it
[2:18:29.200 --> 2:18:33.480]  everybody starts cheering and fireworks go off and that's the kickoff of the
[2:18:33.480 --> 2:18:35.880]  ceremony very christian
[2:18:35.880 --> 2:18:38.400]  yeah well you've you've you've exactly
[2:18:38.400 --> 2:18:42.440]  uh... but uh... all those elements will leave the the dressing up like you
[2:18:42.440 --> 2:18:45.600]  know popes and cardinals and bishops in this kind of thing
[2:18:45.600 --> 2:18:47.760]  the hellfire club did all of that
[2:18:47.760 --> 2:18:51.000]  they also had a statue which they they have
[2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:52.400]  set up sort of a
[2:18:52.400 --> 2:18:55.920]  parallel of at the bohemian grove they had a statue
[2:18:55.920 --> 2:18:58.720]  uh... as you went into their underground
[2:18:58.720 --> 2:19:00.640]  of a figure with his
[2:19:00.640 --> 2:19:02.440]  finger over his lips
[2:19:02.440 --> 2:19:04.480]  mhm like she'd like be quiet
[2:19:04.480 --> 2:19:06.560]  don't you know keep keep secrets
[2:19:06.560 --> 2:19:10.320]  and they do the same thing who is that figure uh... it is a job of maple
[2:19:10.320 --> 2:19:14.080]  knock and the yeah they openly have him as a mascot if you see it it's a
[2:19:14.080 --> 2:19:16.200]  statue of him going like this
[2:19:16.200 --> 2:19:18.440]  and uh... you know later on in the program
[2:19:18.440 --> 2:19:20.240]  probably after we uh... go over
[2:19:20.240 --> 2:19:22.960]  riddles in stone in the next segment i want to go over
[2:19:22.960 --> 2:19:28.640]  this matreya figure that is also at the bohemian grove and also very very large
[2:19:28.640 --> 2:19:29.880]  you know it seems
[2:19:29.880 --> 2:19:32.320]  that the more information we get about the grove
[2:19:32.320 --> 2:19:35.080]  the more into the occult they are the more they are into
[2:19:35.080 --> 2:19:38.680]  you know all these different muster religions all these things outside of
[2:19:38.680 --> 2:19:41.880]  christianity and you know they all you know not all of them but you know the
[2:19:41.880 --> 2:19:45.040]  people like the bush family all we're christian conservatives really what are
[2:19:45.040 --> 2:19:46.000]  you doing
[2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:50.600]  at the bohemian grove and this matreya figure is just as massive
[2:19:50.600 --> 2:19:53.960]  as this mohawk figure would go over that on the other side
[2:19:53.960 --> 2:19:55.200]  the alex joneshow

[2:24:46.920 --> 2:24:50.080]  anybody else does but that doesn't mean I'm not gonna report on it we're joined
[2:24:50.080 --> 2:24:54.280]  by Chris Pinto who is the writer and director of the secret mysteries of
[2:24:54.280 --> 2:24:58.640]  America's beginning series that's the new Atlantis riddles in stone and of
[2:24:58.640 --> 2:25:02.320]  course the latest eye of the Phoenix secrets of the dollar bill you get all
[2:25:02.320 --> 2:25:07.120]  three of them right now at the infowars shop for the bargain price of $59.95 when
[2:25:07.120 --> 2:25:10.840]  you get to you get one free and like I said this these movies are each well
[2:25:10.840 --> 2:25:14.160]  over two hours they cover I mean this interview we're not gonna be able to
[2:25:14.160 --> 2:25:18.400]  cover one-tenth of the information in these films and what's really great
[2:25:18.400 --> 2:25:20.920]  about these films Chris and on the other side I want to get into this
[2:25:20.920 --> 2:25:24.280]  matreya figure and all that other stuff but what's really great about these films
[2:25:24.280 --> 2:25:28.920]  is that you go to the theosophic society you you get information from the horse's
[2:25:28.920 --> 2:25:34.200]  mouth you talk to high-level masons on camera and they reveal so many telling
[2:25:34.200 --> 2:25:38.640]  things I mean one of the most haunting images for me in the entire series is
[2:25:38.640 --> 2:25:43.520]  when you are explaining the stone of destiny and Nicholas Rorick and the
[2:25:43.520 --> 2:25:48.000]  gentleman who's at the theosophic society shows you the little a bust of
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:51.680]  Nicholas Rorick I think it's a copper bust or something like that and he
[2:25:51.680 --> 2:25:55.880]  starts rubbing the box and he I mean look on his face and the way that he's
[2:25:55.880 --> 2:25:59.680]  rubbing this box that Nicholas Rorick is supposedly holding of the stone of
[2:25:59.680 --> 2:26:05.440]  destiny is just so eerie I mean was that kind of the goal to go get the
[2:26:05.440 --> 2:26:09.000]  information from the horse's mouth to go to the theosophic society to go to
[2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:13.520]  those people that would talk you know positively about people like Manly P
[2:26:13.520 --> 2:26:18.160]  Hall and people like who wrote morals and dogma why can't I think of his name
[2:26:18.160 --> 2:26:22.800]  who was who wrote morals and dogma he's he's big time in the series
[2:26:22.800 --> 2:26:27.560]  Albert Pike Albert Pike that's right bust of pike I mean you do such a great
[2:26:27.560 --> 2:26:32.480]  job of again getting the opinions of those who are are in favor of this stuff
[2:26:32.480 --> 2:26:37.040]  who who love Nicholas Rorick who love to be masons I mean was that the goal to
[2:26:37.040 --> 2:26:42.840]  get it right from the source absolutely that was that was our intent you know
[2:26:42.840 --> 2:26:48.320]  as we as we can as we began with volume one there's there's a lot of books you
[2:26:48.320 --> 2:26:51.480]  know a lot of literature out there talking about these issues talking about
[2:26:51.480 --> 2:26:56.760]  free masonry and the secret societies and so on and what I was really hoping
[2:26:56.760 --> 2:27:00.880]  we'd be able to do is to talk to as many of these people as possible and we
[2:27:00.880 --> 2:27:06.760]  created a you know a history channel type format for the series and we told
[2:27:06.760 --> 2:27:09.800]  these guys you know we're gonna we let them know in advance what we were gonna
[2:27:09.800 --> 2:27:14.000]  ask them about so we didn't go in and sneak up on them I would send
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:19.520]  everybody their questions in advance and and these are guys who often speak out
[2:27:19.520 --> 2:27:26.120]  against conspiracy theorists and people like yourself and Alex Jones and guys
[2:27:26.120 --> 2:27:31.160]  like me and whatnot and so you know our approach to them was hey listen we want
[2:27:31.160 --> 2:27:35.120]  to hear your side of the story just you know these are the questions I'm gonna
[2:27:35.120 --> 2:27:39.080]  ask you and you you know you tell me what's the what's the right
[2:27:39.080 --> 2:27:44.440]  understanding of these things and so the interviews were very casual I tried to
[2:27:44.440 --> 2:27:49.600]  keep them very relaxed there was no you know hostile trying to put them in an
[2:27:49.600 --> 2:27:54.800]  awkward position I just asked them the questions and then let them talk and and
[2:27:54.800 --> 2:28:00.360]  I guess because they were relaxed they were willing to come out with and reveal
[2:28:00.360 --> 2:28:04.880]  I think a lot of information that they would have been much more guarded about
[2:28:04.880 --> 2:28:10.480]  otherwise and at least that's what we're told from others who see the series but
[2:28:10.480 --> 2:28:16.560]  that guy Dr. Obadiah Harris at Manly Halls Society and Library who's rubbing
[2:28:16.560 --> 2:28:23.480]  the statue of Nicholas Rorick he's you know he's a particularly creepy guy he's
[2:28:23.480 --> 2:28:31.600]  the guy who says that democracy has an occult promise to it and you you see you
[2:28:31.600 --> 2:28:35.360]  know you and I we grew up in America most Americans grow up with the idea of
[2:28:35.360 --> 2:28:40.440]  democracy and we're just thinking of it you know you you you vote on issues and
[2:28:40.440 --> 2:28:44.560]  it's the will of the people and that kind of thing and it's just American
[2:28:44.560 --> 2:28:54.240]  freedom to the occult society's democracy the idea of self-government is it
[2:28:54.240 --> 2:29:00.800]  takes on a whole different meaning and and it it has a it's just a very
[2:29:00.800 --> 2:29:06.440]  bizarre very mystical meaning and it's about the idea of humanity really
[2:29:06.440 --> 2:29:13.920]  ascending into Godhood and they look forward to the you know a central figure
[2:29:13.920 --> 2:29:20.720]  a whether they call him the matreah the Christ the you know the world teacher a
[2:29:20.720 --> 2:29:25.000]  central figure like a this is why there's so much worship of Barack Obama
[2:29:25.000 --> 2:29:29.680]  because they're looking for somebody like this who will step forward onto the
[2:29:29.680 --> 2:29:36.280]  world stage and lead mankind into this glorious golden era but this man they're
[2:29:36.280 --> 2:29:39.960]  you know that they're anticipating they believe that he is a God and on the other
[2:29:39.960 --> 2:29:43.080]  side we're gonna get into that matreah it's the Alex Jones show we'll be back
[2:29:43.080 --> 2:30:00.440]  after this we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[2:34:46.520 --> 2:34:50.040]  mean it looks like a buda some people are saying this is the new christ this is
[2:34:50.040 --> 2:34:52.400]  going to be the antichrist you touch upon it
[2:34:52.400 --> 2:34:55.760]  uh... in riddles in stone at the end say saying you know
[2:34:55.760 --> 2:34:58.800]  some people believe it's going to be coming very shortly and then really
[2:34:58.800 --> 2:35:00.280]  hit it out of the ballpark
[2:35:00.280 --> 2:35:04.000]  in i of the phoenix why don't you just give a brief synopsis
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:08.240]  of what this means and what what the people who believe in this stuff
[2:35:08.240 --> 2:35:11.160]  think this metrea will bring to them
[2:35:11.160 --> 2:35:14.880]  well a lot of it begins that what goes back they would tell you that it goes
[2:35:14.880 --> 2:35:16.560]  back thousands of years
[2:35:16.560 --> 2:35:19.040]  it really comes into western culture
[2:35:19.040 --> 2:35:24.000]  through madame hb blavatsky who was the founder of the philosophical society
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:27.920]  and we talk about her a lot of people don't realize how many people
[2:35:27.920 --> 2:35:30.840]  prominent people were the opposite this uh...
[2:35:30.840 --> 2:35:34.240]  henry wallace who was the vice president under f d r
[2:35:34.240 --> 2:35:39.040]  uh... mahatma gandhi nehru the first prime minister of uh... of india
[2:35:39.040 --> 2:35:41.960]  uh... thomas edison and a whole host of others
[2:35:41.960 --> 2:35:44.760]  were members of the whole theosophical movement
[2:35:44.760 --> 2:35:49.040]  uh... where madame blavatsky is literally promoting it through her
[2:35:49.040 --> 2:35:51.600]  writing she's promoting lucifer
[2:35:51.600 --> 2:35:54.760]  the archangel lucifer as the true god
[2:35:54.760 --> 2:35:59.320]  and claiming that the god of the bible the god of judo christianity
[2:35:59.320 --> 2:36:01.480]  is a false god and really a devil
[2:36:01.480 --> 2:36:02.800]  uh... in short
[2:36:02.800 --> 2:36:03.920]  but uh...
[2:36:03.920 --> 2:36:05.360]  but she is the one
[2:36:05.360 --> 2:36:10.120]  who writes about this metrea figure she calls him the fifth buddha
[2:36:10.120 --> 2:36:13.240]  the fifth incarnation of katana buddha
[2:36:13.240 --> 2:36:17.360]  and that he would be the final messiah that would come into the world
[2:36:17.360 --> 2:36:21.080]  and lead mankind in this glorious golden era
[2:36:21.080 --> 2:36:25.320]  uh... that uh... that's a short brief explanation of what the uh...
[2:36:25.320 --> 2:36:27.120]  uh... the metrea is
[2:36:27.120 --> 2:36:31.680]  and of course we talk about riddles and stone in the in the second part
[2:36:31.680 --> 2:36:35.440]  uh... because the architecture of washington dc that's what riddles is
[2:36:35.440 --> 2:36:36.240]  about
[2:36:36.240 --> 2:36:39.280]  the architecture of dc is all engineered
[2:36:39.280 --> 2:36:44.320]  to promote the occult doctrine that man is ultimately his own god and that man
[2:36:44.320 --> 2:36:46.160]  ascends into godhood
[2:36:46.160 --> 2:36:48.800]  uh... by degrees by his own power
[2:36:48.800 --> 2:36:51.320]  and that's what the metrea represents
[2:36:51.320 --> 2:36:52.600]  and the uh...
[2:36:52.600 --> 2:36:57.840]  the the sort of a guy who calls himself the john the baptist for the metrea
[2:36:57.840 --> 2:37:00.920]  is this guy benjamin creme who came out
[2:37:00.920 --> 2:37:02.720]  twenty-some odd years ago
[2:37:02.720 --> 2:37:06.600]  and made a declaration in los angeles that the metrea
[2:37:06.600 --> 2:37:09.600]  was getting ready that the christ is here he took out
[2:37:09.600 --> 2:37:11.320]  four-page ad in
[2:37:11.320 --> 2:37:15.040]  newspapers around the world saying the christ is now here
[2:37:15.040 --> 2:37:17.720]  and uh... he calls the christ the metrea
[2:37:17.720 --> 2:37:20.800]  and he's going to come into the world and at any moment
[2:37:20.800 --> 2:37:23.240]  uh... has been saying this for more than twenty years
[2:37:23.240 --> 2:37:26.600]  but what's peculiar is this guy benjamin creme
[2:37:26.600 --> 2:37:28.800]  he speaks at the united nations
[2:37:28.800 --> 2:37:33.320]  he speaks to these uh... uh... uh... political and pseudo political groups
[2:37:33.320 --> 2:37:36.440]  around the world and he's been doing it for decades
[2:37:36.440 --> 2:37:40.560]  uh... in fact we got a brief interview with him in los angeles back in two
[2:37:40.560 --> 2:37:41.840]  thousand six
[2:37:41.840 --> 2:37:44.800]  and he had just come from speaking to uh...
[2:37:44.800 --> 2:37:47.480]  an NGO group in the united nations
[2:37:47.480 --> 2:37:51.680]  and uh... he's he in fact he right after barack obama
[2:37:51.680 --> 2:37:53.640]  was elected president
[2:37:53.640 --> 2:37:56.560]  share international which is his organization
[2:37:56.560 --> 2:37:58.480]  we gave a press release
[2:37:58.480 --> 2:38:01.560]  saying that there were going to be spectacular things happening in the
[2:38:01.560 --> 2:38:02.920]  following year
[2:38:02.920 --> 2:38:07.440]  and that the metrea was going to emerge at some point or so they believe
[2:38:07.440 --> 2:38:08.360]  uh...
[2:38:08.360 --> 2:38:12.200]  but this was this was a central doctrine
[2:38:12.200 --> 2:38:15.920]  surrounding f d r's administration
[2:38:15.920 --> 2:38:19.120]  uh... henry wallace and then nicolas rorick
[2:38:19.120 --> 2:38:23.000]  who was this russian guru this mystic character
[2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:24.600]  who was also a member of
[2:38:24.600 --> 2:38:27.320]  blavatsky's uh... theosophical society
[2:38:27.320 --> 2:38:31.320]  and it's a globalist by the way i mean this guy was all about globalism and uh...
[2:38:31.320 --> 2:38:34.960]  didn't help bring in some of these different uh... organizations
[2:38:34.960 --> 2:38:38.600]  all sure he helped with the founding of the league of nations
[2:38:38.600 --> 2:38:42.160]  uh... and it's he's given credit for the uh... you know
[2:38:42.160 --> 2:38:45.320]  league was dissolved because the world war two and then
[2:38:45.320 --> 2:38:49.680]  he's credited with the formation of the united nations afterwards
[2:38:49.680 --> 2:38:50.440]  uh...
[2:38:50.440 --> 2:38:54.480]  and in fact there was this whole work piece packed that was signed
[2:38:54.480 --> 2:38:58.040]  in the white house by henry wallace with f d r and so on
[2:38:58.040 --> 2:39:01.920]  uh... he was a very influential political figure
[2:39:01.920 --> 2:39:06.760]  uh... nominated for the the uh... nobel peace prize and so on
[2:39:06.760 --> 2:39:09.240]  he was uh... he was a lot of it by
[2:39:09.240 --> 2:39:11.960]  uh... political leaders around the world
[2:39:11.960 --> 2:39:16.040]  especially in into bed in the at the eastern countries and so on
[2:39:16.040 --> 2:39:18.160]  there they celebrated him openly
[2:39:18.160 --> 2:39:21.960]  and if you see his paintings and we go to the rick museum in new york and we
[2:39:21.960 --> 2:39:23.600]  show all of his paintings
[2:39:23.600 --> 2:39:26.320]  his paintings are all promoting
[2:39:26.320 --> 2:39:31.600]  you know globalist ideas ideas of unifying all the world religions
[2:39:31.600 --> 2:39:34.320]  unifying all the countries of the world
[2:39:34.320 --> 2:39:36.960]  uh... and he was specifically
[2:39:36.960 --> 2:39:38.360]  uh... working
[2:39:38.360 --> 2:39:41.680]  uh... through the white house now when he went abroad
[2:39:41.680 --> 2:39:42.440]  toward
[2:39:42.440 --> 2:39:45.240]  uh... creating or helping to create
[2:39:45.240 --> 2:39:49.480]  the uh... the asian union that we're seeing you know come about now but he
[2:39:49.480 --> 2:39:50.960]  was part of the whole
[2:39:50.960 --> 2:39:53.080]  ground working of that movement
[2:39:53.080 --> 2:39:56.080]  uh... during f d r's era
[2:39:56.080 --> 2:40:00.360]  he's promoting this idea of the matriarch when they built his building
[2:40:00.360 --> 2:40:02.400]  called a master building in new york
[2:40:02.400 --> 2:40:04.360]  they laid the cornerstone
[2:40:04.360 --> 2:40:08.720]  and they put in their piece of uh... what he was calling the stone of destiny
[2:40:08.720 --> 2:40:10.400]  with an image
[2:40:10.400 --> 2:40:12.160]  of the matriarch
[2:40:12.160 --> 2:40:16.200]  they put an image of the matriarch inside this cornerstone
[2:40:16.200 --> 2:40:20.240]  uh... and what's really bizarre about this case and this wasn't just an event
[2:40:20.240 --> 2:40:22.520]  where they they played the cornerstone
[2:40:22.520 --> 2:40:25.440]  they had dignitaries come from around the world
[2:40:25.440 --> 2:40:28.120]  from argentina from spain from
[2:40:28.120 --> 2:40:33.480]  romania from all you know all over the world albert einstein sends a tribute
[2:40:33.480 --> 2:40:35.280]  henry wallace is there
[2:40:35.280 --> 2:40:40.440]  i mean it it's this major event in nineteen twenty nine right before
[2:40:40.440 --> 2:40:42.680]  right before the stock market crash
[2:40:42.680 --> 2:40:47.200]  uh... it but it was a very different to environment in america
[2:40:47.200 --> 2:40:50.640]  and there was a very it was a very mystical environment surrounding the
[2:40:50.640 --> 2:40:52.080]  sky rock
[2:40:52.080 --> 2:40:56.600]  and that they're all coming to see this matriarch so when you sent me
[2:40:56.600 --> 2:41:00.040]  these images of the matriarch in the bohemian grove
[2:41:00.040 --> 2:41:05.040]  i thought oh my gosh this really ties it all together but this is the central
[2:41:05.040 --> 2:41:06.200]  theme
[2:41:06.200 --> 2:41:07.600]  for uh...
[2:41:07.600 --> 2:41:12.240]  you know for the secret alcohol groups that are manipulating our world
[2:41:12.240 --> 2:41:13.800]  political system
[2:41:13.800 --> 2:41:17.040]  but they're doing it because they ultimately believe
[2:41:17.040 --> 2:41:22.200]  that all of their efforts are going to missically magically compel
[2:41:22.200 --> 2:41:24.280]  this person whoever he will be
[2:41:24.280 --> 2:41:25.960]  to come into the world
[2:41:25.960 --> 2:41:29.760]  you know now if you're christian as i am then you believe this figure is the
[2:41:29.760 --> 2:41:32.360]  anti christ prophesied in the bible
[2:41:32.360 --> 2:41:36.760]  uh... you know the false messiah that's going to become the one world ruler
[2:41:36.760 --> 2:41:41.960]  uh... but there are i mean there are these groups and they have links that go
[2:41:41.960 --> 2:41:44.640]  to the most powerful offices in the world
[2:41:44.640 --> 2:41:47.760]  we're really trying to bring this to pass
[2:41:47.760 --> 2:41:50.600]  uh... and they're involved as you described earlier
[2:41:50.600 --> 2:41:54.280]  in these occult rituals these satanic you know
[2:41:54.280 --> 2:41:56.560]  mock human sacrifices and
[2:41:56.560 --> 2:42:01.120]  some people even are reporting that they have real human sacrifices there
[2:42:01.120 --> 2:42:03.920]  in the bohemian grove
[2:42:03.920 --> 2:42:06.760]  although i haven't seen you know full confirmation of that
[2:42:06.760 --> 2:42:10.280]  sure but just the fact that we're just now discussing that there's a matria
[2:42:10.280 --> 2:42:13.500]  figure there when obviously these photographs have been out there and you
[2:42:13.500 --> 2:42:16.760]  know mainstream media totally ignores the subject and really the alternative
[2:42:16.760 --> 2:42:18.040]  media only
[2:42:18.040 --> 2:42:22.040]  knows what limited information is out there it seems like this is a different
[2:42:22.040 --> 2:42:25.440]  section of the grove it seems like a different ritual goes on here and it
[2:42:25.440 --> 2:42:26.240]  seems like
[2:42:26.240 --> 2:42:28.920]  you know again the elite are looking at this figure
[2:42:28.920 --> 2:42:33.320]  as like you said this coming christ figure what i don't understand is
[2:42:33.320 --> 2:42:36.880]  where does it fit into buddhism where does this matria fit into the end of
[2:42:36.880 --> 2:42:38.680]  buddhism why are they the same
[2:42:38.680 --> 2:42:41.960]  uh... why are they represented by the same figure
[2:42:41.960 --> 2:42:46.240]  well my my understanding of it is that it gets very
[2:42:46.240 --> 2:42:49.760]  it gets very complicated even if you listen to them explain it
[2:42:49.760 --> 2:42:53.320]  and when you ask them questions the ones who believe all of this
[2:42:53.320 --> 2:42:55.560]  they themselves get confused
[2:42:55.560 --> 2:42:57.120]  but uh... but it's
[2:42:57.120 --> 2:43:02.400]  the matria is supposed to be the fifth incarnation of the original buddha
[2:43:02.400 --> 2:43:07.360]  that he has supposedly five incarnations katano buddha was his name
[2:43:07.360 --> 2:43:11.080]  and he claimed that there would be that he would have a fifth incarnation
[2:43:11.080 --> 2:43:13.960]  and that would be his final incarnation
[2:43:13.960 --> 2:43:18.680]  and so they have uh... throughout eastern mysticism
[2:43:18.680 --> 2:43:21.000]  uh... they have believed
[2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:21.920]  that
[2:43:21.920 --> 2:43:24.520]  this would be that
[2:43:24.520 --> 2:43:26.400]  that jesus and
[2:43:26.400 --> 2:43:27.160]  you know
[2:43:27.160 --> 2:43:30.720]  uh... mohammed and christ and all of these different figures
[2:43:30.720 --> 2:43:34.560]  they believe that they all were inspired by
[2:43:34.560 --> 2:43:39.720]  what they call the christ principle or the christ spirit or christ consciousness
[2:43:39.720 --> 2:43:42.640]  okay that they themselves were not priced
[2:43:42.640 --> 2:43:45.040]  they don't believe that jesus is the christ
[2:43:45.040 --> 2:43:48.840]  uh... they believe that he was just somebody who was inspired by this
[2:43:48.840 --> 2:43:50.000]  energy
[2:43:50.000 --> 2:43:52.560]  but that the real christ figure
[2:43:52.560 --> 2:43:53.800]  is the buddha
[2:43:53.800 --> 2:43:55.700]  is my tray of buddha
[2:43:55.700 --> 2:43:59.280]  and that he will ultimately when he comes into the world
[2:43:59.280 --> 2:44:01.660]  he'll be a global messiah
[2:44:01.660 --> 2:44:06.200]  uh... that appeals to all the world religions and is able to unite all the
[2:44:06.200 --> 2:44:07.440]  world religions
[2:44:07.440 --> 2:44:09.240]  that's what they believe
[2:44:09.240 --> 2:44:10.080]  uh...
[2:44:10.080 --> 2:44:12.640]  it's just crazy to me that you know
[2:44:12.640 --> 2:44:16.320]  some people act like all religion has no stance we need to especially in this
[2:44:16.320 --> 2:44:19.200]  movement they'll say all religion needs to go if we ever want to progress to
[2:44:19.200 --> 2:44:21.560]  man but they never really want to address
[2:44:21.560 --> 2:44:23.480]  is that those who are in
[2:44:23.480 --> 2:44:27.880]  the upper echelons of power the true elite they are religious and their
[2:44:27.880 --> 2:44:31.960]  religion is this occult religion and like you said they do believe
[2:44:31.960 --> 2:44:35.840]  of the coming of this much reya figure i mean how can we get around that how can
[2:44:35.840 --> 2:44:39.200]  we relate to people that he even if you're not religious even if you're a
[2:44:39.200 --> 2:44:43.320]  secular you don't subscribe to christianity or buddhism or you're not a
[2:44:43.320 --> 2:44:45.720]  muslim or a jew
[2:44:45.720 --> 2:44:50.240]  how do we get to those people that this is what they believe
[2:44:50.240 --> 2:44:54.240]  yeah that's a that's a tough one one of the arguments that i make is that try to
[2:44:54.240 --> 2:44:56.640]  explain to people
[2:44:56.640 --> 2:45:00.520]  is the whole doctor in the idea of a separation of church and state
[2:45:00.520 --> 2:45:03.600]  uh... they'll people hear that and they think it means
[2:45:03.600 --> 2:45:05.840]  removing religion from government
[2:45:05.840 --> 2:45:10.000]  and that's not what it means what it means if you study these societies
[2:45:10.000 --> 2:45:14.200]  it means removing the church i e christianity
[2:45:14.200 --> 2:45:16.380]  getting christianity out of
[2:45:16.380 --> 2:45:17.840]  american government
[2:45:17.840 --> 2:45:20.840]  but they want like when you go to washington dc
[2:45:20.840 --> 2:45:25.000]  and you're seeing all of these god and goddess images and so on
[2:45:25.000 --> 2:45:25.840]  i mean
[2:45:25.840 --> 2:45:28.240]  these are all religious symbols
[2:45:28.240 --> 2:45:31.600]  including their the goddess persephone which is on the top of the capital
[2:45:31.600 --> 2:45:35.040]  building a lot of people don't even realize that
[2:45:35.040 --> 2:45:37.720]  uh... you go out in front of the courthouse they had this big deal in
[2:45:37.720 --> 2:45:40.840]  front of courthouse is right getting rid of the ten commandments in front of
[2:45:40.840 --> 2:45:41.840]  the courthouse
[2:45:41.840 --> 2:45:44.160]  but right next to the ten commandments
[2:45:44.160 --> 2:45:46.360]  they have a statue of
[2:45:46.360 --> 2:45:49.120]  be the blindfolded goddess holding the scales
[2:45:49.120 --> 2:45:52.080]  uh... that's the ancient goddess of justice
[2:45:52.080 --> 2:45:56.440]  uh... but nobody ever says anything about getting rid of her the a c l u
[2:45:56.440 --> 2:46:00.920]  is not leading a crusade to get rid of all the religious iconography
[2:46:00.920 --> 2:46:03.440]  they're just trying to get rid of christianity
[2:46:03.440 --> 2:46:06.120]  or judeo christianity biblical
[2:46:06.120 --> 2:46:09.040]  uh... values and teachings and so on
[2:46:09.040 --> 2:46:11.000]  but all of the pagan
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:12.200]  uh... stuff
[2:46:12.200 --> 2:46:16.200]  can remain you know the all-seeing eyes days on the dollar bill the washington
[2:46:16.200 --> 2:46:18.040]  monuments not going where
[2:46:18.040 --> 2:46:20.520]  nobody's ever threatened the statue of liberty
[2:46:20.520 --> 2:46:23.000]  even though lady liberty is based upon
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:26.160]  the Babylonian mother goddess of the ancient world
[2:46:26.160 --> 2:46:28.960]  uh... all of these are religious icons
[2:46:28.960 --> 2:46:33.400]  and what they're doing is their supplanting they're getting rid of
[2:46:33.400 --> 2:46:37.400]  just as they got rid of the teaching of creation in our schools
[2:46:37.400 --> 2:46:40.480]  and then they put in this ancient Hindu
[2:46:40.480 --> 2:46:45.080]  uh... belief about reincarnation but they call it evolution
[2:46:45.080 --> 2:46:47.120]  right and they call it a science
[2:46:47.120 --> 2:46:49.920]  and now that's what they're teaching our schools
[2:46:49.920 --> 2:46:52.800]  uh... but evolutionary teaching doesn't have any
[2:46:52.800 --> 2:46:55.480]  scientific basis to it if you study it
[2:46:55.480 --> 2:46:59.600]  it's all based in the ancient hindu eastern mystical
[2:46:59.600 --> 2:47:03.160]  uh... view about how you know man begins as a
[2:47:03.160 --> 2:47:05.760]  tadpole or something comes back as a
[2:47:05.760 --> 2:47:09.480]  frog comes back at the go to dog at center and so on
[2:47:09.480 --> 2:47:12.440]  is continually evolving upward
[2:47:12.440 --> 2:47:13.960]  toward godhood
[2:47:13.960 --> 2:47:17.120]  that's that's where all of this stuff goes
[2:47:17.120 --> 2:47:20.320]  and uh... it is really what they believe
[2:47:20.320 --> 2:47:25.480]  uh... and they believe this is the true religion of the universe as it were
[2:47:25.480 --> 2:47:28.160]  and anything that you're taught in the bible
[2:47:28.160 --> 2:47:29.720]  is a counterfeit
[2:47:29.720 --> 2:47:33.080]  uh... or that's been misunderstood by
[2:47:33.080 --> 2:47:37.720]  christianity as it were so that's the real enemy for them
[2:47:37.720 --> 2:47:40.480]  uh... and
[2:47:40.480 --> 2:47:43.960]  no i was going to say you know one of the things just to support something that
[2:47:43.960 --> 2:47:46.680]  you guys talk a lot about the idea of
[2:47:46.680 --> 2:47:50.480]  you know what alex jones says it's not about left or right and i couldn't agree
[2:47:50.480 --> 2:47:51.480]  more
[2:47:51.480 --> 2:47:55.160]  uh... one of the things that i often tell people say about george bush who
[2:47:55.160 --> 2:47:57.600]  presents himself as a christian
[2:47:57.600 --> 2:47:59.880]  and he goes off and he's bowing down to the
[2:47:59.880 --> 2:48:02.960]  our god out there in the bohemian grove
[2:48:02.960 --> 2:48:07.000]  uh... if the left-wing media really hated bush
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:10.640]  if they hated bush and they wanted to stop him from becoming president all
[2:48:10.640 --> 2:48:13.880]  they would have had to do is just run a week-long story
[2:48:13.880 --> 2:48:17.400]  on the bohemian grove that the bush family is a part of it
[2:48:17.400 --> 2:48:21.920]  they're bound down to buddhas and and this forty-foot owl god of mohawk
[2:48:21.920 --> 2:48:26.440]  and there's no way evangelical christians would have ever voted for george
[2:48:26.440 --> 2:48:27.600]  bush
[2:48:27.600 --> 2:48:29.800]  they would have never voted for
[2:48:29.800 --> 2:48:34.640]  uh... and so you know the manipulation does happen on the left and on the right
[2:48:34.640 --> 2:48:38.240]  it's like jessie ventura says in that clip you guys have
[2:48:38.240 --> 2:48:40.240]  but it's like professional wrestling
[2:48:40.240 --> 2:48:44.080]  you know they're putting on a show but they're not telling you all the things
[2:48:44.080 --> 2:48:45.920]  that they could tell you
[2:48:45.920 --> 2:48:47.440]  uh... so it's
[2:48:47.440 --> 2:48:51.880]  uh... i i feel bad for my fellow christians in america
[2:48:51.880 --> 2:48:55.160]  because i feel like they're often the ones who are being lied to and
[2:48:55.160 --> 2:48:56.320]  manipulated
[2:48:56.320 --> 2:48:58.560]  because christianity is
[2:48:58.560 --> 2:49:01.040]  you know eighty percent of the people in our country
[2:49:01.040 --> 2:49:03.600]  profess some form of christianity
[2:49:03.600 --> 2:49:07.360]  and so they often use christianity in churches and so on
[2:49:07.360 --> 2:49:09.560]  to manipulate this agenda
[2:49:09.560 --> 2:49:13.240]  and a lot of what we're trying to do through the secret mystery series
[2:49:13.240 --> 2:49:17.000]  uh... which is why we talk about how yes christians did come here in the
[2:49:17.000 --> 2:49:18.040]  beginning
[2:49:18.040 --> 2:49:20.200]  you know with the puritan pilgrim movement
[2:49:20.200 --> 2:49:23.200]  but there were with them the secret groups
[2:49:23.200 --> 2:49:25.640]  and as manly hall says they
[2:49:25.640 --> 2:49:31.120]  reclose their pagan ideas in this garment of christian phrase ology
[2:49:31.120 --> 2:49:35.720]  but the reason was so that they could manipulate the christian population
[2:49:35.720 --> 2:49:38.240]  to carry out their secret agenda
[2:49:38.240 --> 2:49:40.200]  uh... that's what they've been doing for
[2:49:40.200 --> 2:49:41.760]  two hundred years now
[2:49:41.760 --> 2:49:46.040]  what's next for you are you going to do a part four are you going to do another
[2:49:46.040 --> 2:49:49.960]  film project i mean i i love these movies and i i give them out to my
[2:49:49.960 --> 2:49:53.000]  friends and families especially you know on my mother's side they're they're
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:49:55.520]  very christian they're very religious but at the same time
[2:49:55.520 --> 2:49:57.760]  uh... a lot of more bush christians you know they
[2:49:57.760 --> 2:49:59.560]  they don't understand that there is
[2:49:59.560 --> 2:50:02.560]  no difference between the left and right they don't understand that their
[2:50:02.560 --> 2:50:03.160]  leaders
[2:50:03.160 --> 2:50:04.760]  are really into the occult
[2:50:04.760 --> 2:50:08.280]  you know they don't have this broad overview of what you present so i think
[2:50:08.280 --> 2:50:08.680]  it's a
[2:50:08.680 --> 2:50:12.680]  a great eye-opener if i can actually get them to throw it into the dvd player
[2:50:12.680 --> 2:50:15.840]  what's next for chris pinto and david bay
[2:50:15.840 --> 2:50:20.520]  well for for myself and david we are uh... we're we're doing our pre
[2:50:20.520 --> 2:50:23.840]  production stuff for secret mysteries park

[2:54:32.960 --> 2:54:37.560]  questioning how could alex jones possibly get into the bohemian grove and he
[2:54:37.560 --> 2:54:41.560]  was insinuating that alex was a member and it was all a conspiracy and blah
[2:54:41.560 --> 2:54:44.880]  blah blah the truth is in the early eighties they did do some mainline
[2:54:44.880 --> 2:54:49.160]  reporting on the bohemian grove and we have those clips are they're gonna be in
[2:54:49.160 --> 2:54:53.080]  my next film invisible empire which really goes over this globalist new world
[2:54:53.080 --> 2:54:58.360]  order agenda tom brokaw talking about it a bc news talking about it but in the

[2:55:03.080 --> 2:55:06.680]  will zoom out from it to see what other characters are here but you have a news
[2:55:06.680 --> 2:55:10.560]  reporter sitting here and he's also a cartoonist and he she's drawing a
[2:55:10.560 --> 2:55:14.240]  picture and a if you miss this if you're listening to check it out on youtube
[2:55:14.240 --> 2:55:14.840]  later
[2:55:14.840 --> 2:55:18.880]  uh... he's drawing he's he's pretending he's doing the news but there's the
[2:55:18.880 --> 2:55:22.120]  thought bubble behind him and he's in a robe and he has a candle he's a member
[2:55:22.120 --> 2:55:26.360]  of the bohemian grove and he's basically talking to everybody zoom out a little
[2:55:26.360 --> 2:55:29.000]  further and let's see who are good friends are above him
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:35.680]  all look it's newt gingrich and george w bush and george h w bush the very
[2:55:35.680 --> 2:55:38.240]  good christian men
[2:55:38.240 --> 2:55:42.440]  believable you know what do you say to those kind of critics that you know they
[2:55:42.440 --> 2:55:45.960]  think that everything's a conspiracy they think because alex was able to get
[2:55:45.960 --> 2:55:50.240]  into the bohemian grove he must be a member or a vatican assassin i mean to
[2:55:50.240 --> 2:55:54.360]  me it's just ludicrous but to the outsider looking and how do you explain
[2:55:54.360 --> 2:55:54.960]  to him
[2:55:54.960 --> 2:55:58.240]  how do you explain them that's not what happened
[2:55:58.240 --> 2:56:02.360]  well i would uh... you know i but we've dealt with some of those people as
[2:56:02.360 --> 2:56:06.720]  well we had a woman call and accuse us of being controlled by radical muslims
[2:56:06.720 --> 2:56:12.440]  and that's the job because in our documentaries we hadn't mentioned
[2:56:12.440 --> 2:56:14.080]  islam or or something
[2:56:14.080 --> 2:56:19.120]  i mean if some people do i think i think alex jones and and you guys you do a
[2:56:19.120 --> 2:56:23.160]  great job uh... because you're very careful to document the things that
[2:56:23.160 --> 2:56:26.400]  you're talking about and we try to do the same thing in our films
[2:56:26.400 --> 2:56:30.960]  uh... and what what ends up happening is you put aside a lot of your
[2:56:30.960 --> 2:56:34.760]  conspiracy theories if you have a conspiracy theory about something and
[2:56:34.760 --> 2:56:36.320]  you go and investigate it
[2:56:36.320 --> 2:56:40.480]  sometimes you're wrong you know sometimes you you you had an idea about
[2:56:40.480 --> 2:56:43.120]  something and it just wasn't the right idea
[2:56:43.120 --> 2:56:44.200]  uh...
[2:56:44.200 --> 2:56:48.680]  but i think that's why so careful to document your evidence but those
[2:56:48.680 --> 2:56:50.840]  kind of accusations against
[2:56:50.840 --> 2:56:54.840]  uh... alex i've seen them against my partner david bay
[2:56:54.840 --> 2:56:58.720]  he's been openly accused of being a member of the uh... of the illuminati
[2:56:58.720 --> 2:56:59.840]  because
[2:56:59.840 --> 2:57:04.640]  we mentioned sir francis bacon and and uh... there was this whole conspiracy
[2:57:04.640 --> 2:57:06.600]  theory that went on about that
[2:57:06.600 --> 2:57:09.680]  uh... i think it just kind of comes with the territory
[2:57:09.680 --> 2:57:14.000]  and so uh... we encourage people to be you know to be careful
[2:57:14.000 --> 2:57:18.280]  uh... to prove all things of the bible says you know we're christians and we
[2:57:18.280 --> 2:57:22.480]  admonish people the bible also says accused no man falsely
[2:57:22.480 --> 2:57:24.520]  so we try to refrain from that
[2:57:24.520 --> 2:57:26.960]  and just encourage people to uh...
[2:57:26.960 --> 2:57:31.400]  uh... seek the truth and we try to present as much documentation is possible
[2:57:31.400 --> 2:57:36.000]  uh... to convict people so they would go and conduct their own investigation
[2:57:36.000 --> 2:57:39.720]  exactly the proof is in the pudding and we put this stuff out there we source
[2:57:39.720 --> 2:57:42.840]  and we hope that people check out our source material that's what this is
[2:57:42.840 --> 2:57:44.240]  about when you talk
[2:57:44.240 --> 2:57:47.360]  about the pentagram in riddles and stone that's
[2:57:47.360 --> 2:57:50.800]  inlaid in the dc architecture of course with the open segment
[2:57:50.800 --> 2:57:55.840]  you explain this is a faustian process and out of one of his plays correct
[2:57:55.840 --> 2:57:59.880]  absolutely and we show that it you know it's it's mentioned by a uh... a very
[2:57:59.880 --> 2:58:01.560]  high-ranking mason
[2:58:01.560 --> 2:58:03.880]  uh... gerta the famous german writer
[2:58:03.880 --> 2:58:05.000]  in fouls

[3:01:10.360 --> 3:01:17.600]  this clip of this young girl being arrested for calling 911 because her
[3:01:17.600 --> 3:01:25.360]  father's having a seizure how dare she hit it jaren and we're in Lincoln Park
[3:01:25.360 --> 3:01:30.800]  every year people dial 911 more than 14,000 times and let's make it clear
[3:01:30.800 --> 3:01:35.440]  right up front those emergency calls are generally very well handled but that
[3:01:35.440 --> 3:01:39.920]  doesn't make what happened to Adrienne Ledesma any less shocking I was really
[3:01:39.920 --> 3:01:46.600]  scared because you know it's my dad and he fell it's not so far like that his
[3:01:46.600 --> 3:01:50.080]  fall was so frightening because he was just three weeks out of the hospital
[3:01:50.080 --> 3:01:53.400]  where he underwent brain surgery and suddenly he's on the kitchen floor
[3:01:53.400 --> 3:01:59.200]  unconscious and shaking with a severe seizure I was scared like I don't know
[3:01:59.200 --> 3:02:04.360]  it was freaking out so this 17 year old grabbed her phone and dialed 911 she says
[3:02:04.360 --> 3:02:08.240]  she got no quick answer so hung up and called again now you know those
[3:02:08.240 --> 3:02:12.400]  emergency calls are recorded but did you know the recording starts even before
[3:02:12.400 --> 3:02:20.160]  the call is answered so you can hear her near panic when again she can't get an
[3:02:20.160 --> 3:02:29.080]  immediate answer blurting out the F word just as the call is picked up 911 but
[3:02:29.080 --> 3:02:33.400]  the Lincoln Park cop who takes the call admonishes her and only makes her more
[3:02:33.400 --> 3:02:38.560]  frantic well okay first of all you don't need to swear over 911 okay and
[3:02:38.560 --> 3:02:43.440]  slow down ambulance you haven't had a chance to tell him how serious this is
[3:02:43.440 --> 3:02:48.520]  right and he's already hung up the phone well I thought my dad was gonna die I
[3:02:48.520 --> 3:02:53.720]  was really scared so you call back 911 are you gonna give me an ambulance are
[3:02:53.720 --> 3:03:01.080]  you gonna swear again you stupid no you're not gonna want your dad still on
[3:03:01.080 --> 3:03:04.200]  the floor well I'm thinking he's seriously hurt because he's still
[3:03:04.200 --> 3:03:08.200]  having a seizure and it's really long seizure and I'm thinking that I want to
[3:03:08.200 --> 3:03:11.720]  you know complain about this guy because he shouldn't be hanging up on me so she
[3:03:11.720 --> 3:03:25.160]  calls back a third time 911 after wasting more than six minutes the cop
[3:03:25.160 --> 3:03:30.720]  finally called the rescue squad I kept getting a 911 call from this filthy
[3:03:30.720 --> 3:03:34.560]  mouth girl it wanted a rescue I never found out what it was and I was never
[3:03:34.560 --> 3:03:38.280]  able to transfer it over to you and that's the same story he told on the
[3:03:38.280 --> 3:03:43.040]  police radio when he dispatched a squad car to the house I kept getting 911
[3:03:43.040 --> 3:03:48.080]  calls from this girl hot-filed girl requesting a rescue no idea what it's
[3:03:48.080 --> 3:03:53.880]  for I couldn't get through her all right let's stop it couldn't get through
[3:03:53.880 --> 3:03:58.280]  her comments he hung up on her three times she ran to the police station
[3:03:58.280 --> 3:04:04.000]  guess what she gets arrested this guy needs to lose his job let me repeat he
[3:04:04.000 --> 3:04:08.440]  needs to lose his job she's trying to get an ambulance for her father you
[3:04:08.440 --> 3:04:15.160]  don't hang up on somebody who's calling 911 for an ambulance give me a break and
[3:04:15.160 --> 3:04:18.680]  this just shows how out of control the police officers are how they're on
[3:04:18.680 --> 3:04:22.200]  power trips you know we would have showed another clip and they will do so at
[3:04:22.200 --> 3:04:25.960]  the end of the show where people go to protest Scientology they don't get within

[3:07:08.080 --> 3:07:11.600]  while taking hot showers than when drinking the water that's because many
[3:07:11.600 --> 3:07:15.120]  chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the

[3:08:54.120 --> 3:08:59.120]  you today Alan not too bad not too bad well I want to get your take on this
[3:08:59.120 --> 3:09:04.880]  latest DHS document and really just the out of control nature of police officers
[3:09:04.880 --> 3:09:08.640]  around the country we just played that clip where this girl is trying to call
[3:09:08.640 --> 3:09:13.920]  911 for her father she uses the naughty F word God forbid she uses the F word
[3:09:13.920 --> 3:09:18.160]  because she's in a panic and she's actually hung up on by these police
[3:09:18.160 --> 3:09:22.800]  officers then she goes down four blocks to try to you know report this to the
[3:09:22.800 --> 3:09:26.120]  police department the only officer that's on duty is the one that took her
[3:09:26.120 --> 3:09:29.680]  phone calls and she's immediately arrested I mean what does that say about
[3:09:29.680 --> 3:09:37.880]  our society well we've had gradual indoctrination over 20 odd years maybe
[3:09:37.880 --> 3:09:43.760]  30 mainly through fictional media entertainment beginning even with
[3:09:43.760 --> 3:09:47.480]  stashkin hutch which was banned in Britain at one time because they
[3:09:47.480 --> 3:09:50.280]  eventually started pulling their guns out on everybody they saw on every
[3:09:50.280 --> 3:09:55.680]  episode but now it's a standard fear the cops or the bosses they're the
[3:09:55.680 --> 3:10:00.640]  authoritarian figures and the cops themselves come out of the same society
[3:10:00.640 --> 3:10:05.040]  of indoctrination so they truly believe that they are authoritarian figures and
[3:10:05.040 --> 3:10:08.720]  you were supposed to obey them they don't get taught that they're there to
[3:10:08.720 --> 3:10:11.880]  serve the public anymore and they haven't been taught that for an awful
[3:10:11.880 --> 3:10:15.680]  long time and we got to remember too police are in the business of laying
[3:10:15.680 --> 3:10:22.040]  charges that's their function and if you call the cops for anything I think
[3:10:22.040 --> 3:10:26.560]  really you're a fool because there's even videos up there with x cops who are
[3:10:26.560 --> 3:10:32.160]  now these lawyers they put into law stating quite openly that that's their
[3:10:32.160 --> 3:10:36.240]  function is to lay charges on people they don't care who and they actually call
[3:10:36.240 --> 3:10:40.400]  on the videos up on Google they should call them the public stupid and explain
[3:10:40.400 --> 3:10:44.600]  why they're stupid because a public perception is still the old perception
[3:10:44.600 --> 3:10:48.240]  that the cops are there to help them cops are not there to help you they're
[3:10:48.240 --> 3:10:53.440]  there to get charges laid on anybody for anything it doesn't matter if you call
[3:10:53.440 --> 3:10:57.200]  them and you can mention your house just have a chat if they find anything at
[3:10:57.200 --> 3:11:00.600]  all they can charge you with they'll do it and we've got to understand that's
[3:11:00.600 --> 3:11:05.560]  really what their purpose is all right well let's shift gears to this latest
[3:11:05.560 --> 3:11:11.560]  DHS document domestic extremism lexicon I mean this one this is the third
[3:11:11.560 --> 3:11:16.440]  document from DHS that we've talked about obviously the fourth if you include
[3:11:16.440 --> 3:11:20.720]  the Mayak report but right out of the gates they say this is for non-islamic
[3:11:20.720 --> 3:11:25.880]  extremism in this country and really DHS was built up under the guise that we
[3:11:25.880 --> 3:11:29.520]  were going to fight al-qaeda in the Taliban and we needed this new agency
[3:11:29.520 --> 3:11:33.400]  but nothing could be further from the truth this is for the American public
[3:11:33.400 --> 3:11:38.640]  is it not absolutely absolutely but then again people who still believe the
[3:11:38.640 --> 3:11:42.560]  government is there to serve them once again need to get their head checked
[3:11:42.560 --> 3:11:46.640]  because that would have a long time ago the government has an agenda and they'll
[3:11:46.640 --> 3:11:50.560]  lie about everything to get along the books which they intend to expand as
[3:11:50.560 --> 3:11:55.200]  soon as it's passed so absolutely that's the whole key we're going into a
[3:11:55.200 --> 3:11:59.680]  complete new world order where we won't have no rights whatsoever they've made
[3:11:59.680 --> 3:12:04.200]  that quite plain and all they need is our compliance at every stage to accept
[3:12:04.200 --> 3:12:07.760]  it and then they can bring through the next part and the next part and the
[3:12:07.760 --> 3:12:11.280]  next part there are no rights and freedoms anymore as far as governments
[3:12:11.280 --> 3:12:15.840]  are concerned and the public and I've been trained that that is so as well
[3:12:15.840 --> 3:12:21.120]  absolutely and in the UK right now they have now banned 16 people from coming
[3:12:21.120 --> 3:12:24.680]  into the country they're only only releasing 10 names who knows who the
[3:12:24.680 --> 3:12:29.480]  other six are but this same woman is out there saying you know what on top of
[3:12:29.480 --> 3:12:33.360]  that this ID card is great we can play that clip in fact we'll play that clip
[3:12:33.360 --> 3:12:37.040]  coming up in the next segment she's basically saying oh the biometric
[3:12:37.040 --> 3:12:40.800]  thumb scan and your face scan will be on this card and it's a good thing because
[3:12:40.800 --> 3:12:44.400]  people already have to prove who they are and it's really inconvenient if you
[3:12:44.400 --> 3:12:47.920]  have to bring in your electric bill all this nonsense and then she says well it
[3:12:47.920 --> 3:12:51.640]  really doesn't matter anyway because 30,000 people already have it and by the
[3:12:51.640 --> 3:12:55.160]  end of the year 70,000 will have it like you said it's this incremental step
[3:12:55.160 --> 3:12:59.640]  into this new world order and I think that's a big part of it it's a big part
[3:12:59.640 --> 3:13:04.680]  and again it was planned a long time ago because back in the 90s and main
[3:13:04.680 --> 3:13:11.640]  mainstream Canadian CBC government television Wendy Mesley had a show where
[3:13:11.640 --> 3:13:17.280]  she talked about the coming ID cards in the mid 90s as such as 1998 and she talked
[3:13:17.280 --> 3:13:20.880]  to the manufacturers that would be manufacturing it for Canada the US and
[3:13:20.880 --> 3:13:25.360]  Britain she talked to the Border Patrol guys too who'd already implemented it
[3:13:25.360 --> 3:13:30.360]  on a voluntary basis back in 1998 and when she says well a lot of people
[3:13:30.360 --> 3:13:35.040]  won't like this to the heads of the corporation that prints them up and makes
[3:13:35.040 --> 3:13:39.800]  them and the guy said that the public will be given no option anyway they'll
[3:13:39.800 --> 3:13:44.480]  have to take it so this is a plan that was made a long time ago and it's
[3:13:44.480 --> 3:13:49.200]  simply being run through under the guise of security yeah and meanwhile we have
[3:13:49.200 --> 3:13:54.560]  the internet being regulated at all ends we have this cyber security act being
[3:13:54.560 --> 3:14:00.520]  introduced by Jay Rockefeller we now have HR 1966 the cyber bullying act where
[3:14:00.520 --> 3:14:04.440]  really they say oh we have to save the children from the internet with
[3:14:04.440 --> 3:14:09.120]  literally no statistics to support their claims for instance they say 60% of
[3:14:09.120 --> 3:14:12.160]  mental health professionals who responded to a survey of internet mental
[3:14:12.160 --> 3:14:17.200]  health issues report having treated at least one patient one with problematic
[3:14:17.200 --> 3:14:21.880]  internet experiences in the previous five years so one person in five years had
[3:14:21.880 --> 3:14:25.840]  a bad experience on the internet supposedly cause their mental illness we
[3:14:25.840 --> 3:14:29.080]  know that's not the case and they probably mentally ill or just put into
[3:14:29.080 --> 3:14:32.480]  that subsection so that they could heavily medicate them as that's part of
[3:14:32.480 --> 3:14:38.240]  the plan and then they say 54% of these clients were 18 years of age or younger
[3:14:38.240 --> 3:14:41.720]  I mean though that's just ludicrous so let's just shut down the internet or
[3:14:41.720 --> 3:14:44.720]  let's just charge people they're saying that they'll be able to charge people
[3:14:44.720 --> 3:14:50.200]  and convict them and they'll have to do two years in prison and pay a fine it's
[3:14:50.200 --> 3:14:55.280]  much much bigger than that even FDR said they said there are lies in politics
[3:14:55.280 --> 3:15:00.160]  then there are damned lies and then there are statistics because with
[3:15:00.160 --> 3:15:03.600]  statistics you can prove anything you want to prove you see and we don't see
[3:15:03.600 --> 3:15:06.880]  them as lies we think it's scientific data that's why they're always seeing
[3:15:06.880 --> 3:15:10.920]  statistics but it's just lies just nonetheless they have an agenda the
[3:15:10.920 --> 3:15:14.720]  internet was put out there to get everyone on it because they could not
[3:15:14.720 --> 3:15:19.560]  have a totally controlled society without using the internet and getting us
[3:15:19.560 --> 3:15:23.840]  hooked on it for everything now we're going into a world cashless society
[3:15:23.840 --> 3:15:27.120]  we're going into a world where you can't pay a rent your mortgage or anything
[3:15:27.120 --> 3:15:31.640]  except through internet so eventually if they blacklist you you'll be unable to
[3:15:31.640 --> 3:15:35.360]  pay for anything you've been outcast you'll be on the streets and then you
[3:15:35.360 --> 3:15:39.280]  use it as a form of punishment and control on the public that's why we've
[3:15:39.280 --> 3:15:44.040]  got it and so many people yeah so many people are out there volunteering their
[3:15:44.040 --> 3:15:48.080]  information not even realizing you know how serious it is when you have a
[3:15:48.080 --> 3:15:51.320]  Facebook page and I have a Facebook page I have a MySpace but I'm not
[3:15:51.320 --> 3:15:54.920]  constantly updating people put their status on there they literally tell
[3:15:54.920 --> 3:15:58.000]  their life story what I'm doing at this minute that minute this minute they
[3:15:58.000 --> 3:16:01.400]  put up pictures from every event they've ever been to I've never been a big
[3:16:01.400 --> 3:16:04.400]  picture hound I don't really post that much stuff but they are literally
[3:16:04.400 --> 3:16:08.960]  creating a profile on themselves that will be data-based by this government
[3:16:08.960 --> 3:16:13.160]  it's already been stated by the British and Canadian governments they're using
[3:16:13.160 --> 3:16:17.360]  everything on that you put up voluntarily as legal evidence should
[3:16:17.360 --> 3:16:21.240]  they ever have to use it against you absolutely you know I want to go and I
[3:16:21.240 --> 3:16:25.640]  want to play this clip of this this monster of a woman who has banned
[3:16:25.640 --> 3:16:30.800]  against 16 people from her country and is gleefully talking about the coming
[3:16:30.800 --> 3:16:37.820]  identification cards in the United Kingdom hit it jaren the key words for me
[3:16:37.820 --> 3:16:41.920]  when it comes to the identity service art security and convenience you know
[3:16:41.920 --> 3:16:45.760]  it's be clear we already wander quite often around the streets with large
[3:16:45.760 --> 3:16:52.000]  amounts of personal information utility bills passports other information that
[3:16:52.000 --> 3:16:56.080]  we need to use at the moment to prove our identity an identity card is a more
[3:16:56.080 --> 3:17:00.160]  secure and convenient way to do something that we're already having to do
[3:17:00.160 --> 3:17:06.000]  without actually sharing as much personal data as we now have to but I think
[3:17:06.000 --> 3:17:09.600]  it's right as well when we're thinking about the convenience of how you enroll
[3:17:09.600 --> 3:17:14.240]  your facial image your fingerprints both for ID cards and incidentally for
[3:17:14.240 --> 3:17:18.400]  biometric passports that we make that as convenient as possible for the public
[3:17:18.400 --> 3:17:22.560]  we're used in this country to having our digital photos taken for our passports
[3:17:22.560 --> 3:17:27.360]  in high street outlets I believe that we can offer that opportunity to people
[3:17:27.360 --> 3:17:32.200]  for to have their biometric fingerprints taken as well and we can do that in a
[3:17:32.200 --> 3:17:35.960]  secure way but in a way that's also convenient to people so it's not so
[3:17:35.960 --> 3:17:41.440]  why elephant is mr. Green is referred to well look there are 70,000 by the end
[3:17:41.440 --> 3:17:45.080]  of this year there'll be 70,000 ID cards already in people's hands there's
[3:17:45.080 --> 3:17:49.600]  already 30,000 they're helping foreign nationals to prove their right to be
[3:17:49.600 --> 3:17:52.640]  here they're helping employers to be more secure that people have got the
[3:17:52.640 --> 3:17:56.320]  right to work we're already having to prove our identity I think it's the
[3:17:56.320 --> 3:18:00.640]  role of government to help people to do that more securely and more conveniently
[3:18:00.640 --> 3:18:05.280]  and at the same time to help people to protect their identity so that I could be
[3:18:05.280 --> 3:18:09.720]  confident that somebody else isn't pretending to be me either so that they
[3:18:09.720 --> 3:18:13.960]  can commit crime or even terrorism or that they can defraud me seems to me
[3:18:13.960 --> 3:18:17.840]  those are the sorts of protections that government has a responsibility to put
[3:18:17.840 --> 3:18:20.840]  in place for its citizens if the tourists don't want to take that
[3:18:20.840 --> 3:18:24.120]  responsibility on that's up to them they'll have to explain it to the
[3:18:24.120 --> 3:18:28.160]  electorate but for me that's an important role of what government being on the
[3:18:28.160 --> 3:18:32.160]  side of the public is about you see governments here to help and protect and
[3:18:32.160 --> 3:18:36.120]  stop sit and stop terror and she just makes up all these ludicrous lies that
[3:18:36.120 --> 3:18:40.200]  people are just randomly wandering around with their bills and their
[3:18:40.200 --> 3:18:43.800]  information and their passports people carry their passports when they're
[3:18:43.800 --> 3:18:48.240]  leaving the country or entering another one never I only carry my electric bill
[3:18:48.240 --> 3:18:52.360]  when I'm going to pay it Alan I mean her arguments are absolutely insane
[3:18:52.360 --> 3:18:57.040]  well there are no arguments at all it's just a political liar giving you the
[3:18:57.040 --> 3:19:03.160]  spiel and that's her job politicians don't see the public is someone
[3:19:03.160 --> 3:19:07.800]  they're responsible to they see the public as basically just a big hair that
[3:19:07.800 --> 3:19:12.320]  must be manipulated in light so in order to get what's right for them what's how
[3:19:12.320 --> 3:19:18.600]  they should behave and how they should act etc back in the 90s Canada and the
[3:19:18.600 --> 3:19:22.960]  US and all British Commonwealth countries brought it and bought it in Canada alone
[3:19:22.960 --> 3:19:27.760]  bought five super create computers Australia did the same thing these were
[3:19:27.760 --> 3:19:32.960]  owned by the post office of all places and they created mark massive
[3:19:32.960 --> 3:19:36.840]  buildings for them and no one could tell us what they were for because one
[3:19:36.840 --> 3:19:40.440]  super create computer could handle all the data of everyone in the US and
[3:19:40.440 --> 3:19:45.120]  Canada it turns out it was for the coming ID cards that were not hearing
[3:19:45.120 --> 3:19:49.160]  about this is back in the 90s we're already building the facilities for it
[3:19:49.160 --> 3:19:53.280]  we're simply living through an agenda and it's the politicians job simply to
[3:19:53.280 --> 3:19:58.040]  caught us to go along with that thinking is under the guys absolutely and we'll
[3:19:58.040 --> 3:20:02.240]  be back to discuss that on the other side it's the Alex Jones show attention
[3:20:02.240 --> 3:20:06.160]  gardeners this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update GCN has just
[3:20:06.160 --> 3:20:09.960]  discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants flowers and herbs it's
[3:20:09.960 --> 3:20:13.280]  called proto grow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it
[3:20:13.280 --> 3:20:17.120]  seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil in
[3:20:17.120 --> 3:20:20.240]  light conditions now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for
[3:20:20.240 --> 3:20:24.360]  self-reliance proto grows unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral
[3:20:24.360 --> 3:20:27.960]  uptake and dramatically increases bloom set creating maximum plant growth in
[3:20:27.960 --> 3:20:31.160]  minimum time proto grow works by providing geometric keys which have the
[3:20:31.160 --> 3:20:34.400]  capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants
[3:20:34.400 --> 3:20:37.440]  proto grows full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with
[3:20:37.440 --> 3:20:40.960]  extraordinary taste enough to 10 times the nutritional value and if you want to
[3:20:40.960 --> 3:20:44.520]  double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass you can if you want to grow
[3:20:44.520 --> 3:20:48.520]  nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids it's now easy GCN listeners who
[3:20:48.520 --> 3:20:51.560]  want to grow dirt chief superfood should visit the proto grow website at grow

[3:21:05.800 --> 3:21:10.760]  Obama is the tip of the spear we've got to give them a stake in creating the kind
[3:21:10.760 --> 3:21:15.440]  of world order that I think all of us would like to see the Obama deception
[3:21:15.440 --> 3:21:19.600]  completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the
[3:21:19.600 --> 3:21:24.280]  American people while Obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one in
[3:21:24.280 --> 3:21:28.040]  this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of
[3:21:28.040 --> 3:21:33.520]  personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers
[3:21:33.520 --> 3:21:40.360]  and finance oligarchs that's fascism it's not about left to right it's about a
[3:21:40.360 --> 3:21:46.120]  one-world government this film documents who Obama works for the lies he is told

[3:22:07.560 --> 3:22:12.840]  unfortunately with taxation the rising cost of food energy housing and medical
[3:22:12.840 --> 3:22:17.000]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line is this a flaw free
[3:22:17.000 --> 3:22:20.600]  enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve note forcing
[3:22:20.600 --> 3:22:25.000]  us into perpetual debt ensuring inflation and higher taxes these questions

[3:24:17.080 --> 3:24:22.360]  all right folks we are back is the Alice Jones show I'm Jason Burma sitting in
[3:24:22.360 --> 3:24:27.080]  we're joined by Alan Watt of cutting through the matrix.com and you know
[3:24:27.080 --> 3:24:30.640]  the Bilderberg meeting where a lot of these elites get together and really
[3:24:30.640 --> 3:24:37.600]  codify their agenda we'll be meeting in about one week over and I think it's
[3:24:37.600 --> 3:24:42.240]  going to be in Greece this year and we reported a couple weeks ago that I think
[3:24:42.240 --> 3:24:47.520]  it was Enion Devonnier saying that they had created the Euro through the
[3:24:47.520 --> 3:24:50.480]  Bilderberg group now remember the Bilderberg group didn't exist and then
[3:24:50.480 --> 3:24:54.480]  they said oh it's just a golf club and they don't set any policy there obvious
[3:24:54.480 --> 3:24:59.480]  lies however right now and this is stories over at prismplanet.com leaked
[3:24:59.480 --> 3:25:06.080]  1955 Bilderberg documents outline plan for a single European currency almost 40
[3:25:06.080 --> 3:25:13.560]  years before it was codified in 1992 now this isn't a surprise to you or me Alan
[3:25:13.560 --> 3:25:18.240]  but it really does speak to the fact that these guys are the policymakers they
[3:25:18.240 --> 3:25:22.600]  are people who believe that they are lords are gods the people who should rule
[3:25:22.600 --> 3:25:27.400]  over us the masses the sheeple the chattel if you will I mean those are the
[3:25:27.400 --> 3:25:32.040]  names they call us and this is just a further illustration that they are the
[3:25:32.040 --> 3:25:37.000]  puppet masters behind the scenes. There's certainly one of the main groups
[3:25:37.000 --> 3:25:42.000]  there's no doubt about it but even John Maynard Keynes and the late and in the mid
[3:25:42.000 --> 3:25:45.160]  40s when they were setting up the Bretton Woods Agreement for the monetary
[3:25:45.160 --> 3:25:49.640]  system when he said this is part one part two will be a global monetary system
[3:25:49.640 --> 3:25:54.080]  and he said it also to that the trading blocks that they would build up from then
[3:25:54.080 --> 3:25:58.600]  on because they already plan to unite Europe and during World War two he said
[3:25:58.600 --> 3:26:02.280]  that they'll bring in a unitary currency for Europe and then one for the
[3:26:02.280 --> 3:26:06.400]  Americas later and also a global currency although he said they wouldn't see the
[3:26:06.400 --> 3:26:09.800]  global currency in his lifetime that would be the next century which is now
[3:26:09.800 --> 3:26:13.640]  but as I say we're living through a script and when you find their old books
[3:26:13.640 --> 3:26:18.720]  you have no doubt about it whatsoever. So what do you think is going to be on the
[3:26:18.720 --> 3:26:24.000]  agenda this year at the Bilderberg group I mean again they meet in a week in my
[3:26:24.000 --> 3:26:28.240]  mind you know there's 144 public members so you know it's kind of like this
[3:26:28.240 --> 3:26:33.040]  compartmentalized group of people very small and then in another month or so
[3:26:33.040 --> 3:26:35.960]  they're going to be meeting at the Bohemian Grove when you have 3,000
[3:26:35.960 --> 3:26:39.720]  people there and those people who are at the Bilderberg group will give their
[3:26:39.720 --> 3:26:44.760]  agenda to their underlings at the Bohemian Grove so you have a system
[3:26:44.760 --> 3:26:48.360]  where it's a need to know system some people are more in the know than others
[3:26:48.360 --> 3:26:52.840]  and the people in the Bohemian Grove most of them are less in the know say
[3:26:52.840 --> 3:26:56.480]  than those that attended the Bilderberg conference they're given an agenda
[3:26:56.480 --> 3:27:02.720]  they're given a job to carry out but they may not know why and also to the I
[3:27:02.720 --> 3:27:07.240]  think that the thing will be the the true bringing up of the international
[3:27:07.240 --> 3:27:10.880]  monetary funds to its proper place they're already admitted they're
[3:27:10.880 --> 3:27:15.040]  going to be the world's issuers of currency and that would be part one but
[3:27:15.040 --> 3:27:18.600]  also the biggest part two is also population control now they're really
[3:27:18.600 --> 3:27:23.000]  on a roll to get the public to accept they must have population reduction by
[3:27:23.000 --> 3:27:28.160]  government's law and order etc. Yeah absolutely now we played some of those
[3:27:28.160 --> 3:27:31.320]  clips because we had one of those heckler callers in the beginning go oh
[3:27:31.320 --> 3:27:35.440]  they want to kill 80% as well those are in their own documents and you've got
[3:27:35.440 --> 3:27:38.400]  Ted Turner running around saying there's already too many people on the
[3:27:38.400 --> 3:27:42.360]  planet and we need to say sustainable society then we actually have the world
[3:27:42.360 --> 3:27:47.240]  sustainable society this organization with Gordon Brown and others including
[3:27:47.240 --> 3:27:51.920]  the global warming czar of the Obama administration who's openly for global
[3:27:51.920 --> 3:27:56.320]  governance and in these groups they say well we're just gonna have to take the
[3:27:56.320 --> 3:28:00.320]  population down we have people talking about taking the population from the UK
[3:28:00.320 --> 3:28:05.000]  from it's at 60 million officially is probably more like 70 million down to
[3:28:05.000 --> 3:28:10.080]  30 million by 2027 how is that going to be it possible unless they sterilize
[3:28:10.080 --> 3:28:13.920]  everybody and kill half the population yeah well they're already sterilizing
[3:28:13.920 --> 3:28:18.200]  people they've admitted that now what's happening is just a pure coincidence
[3:28:18.200 --> 3:28:21.560]  they were putting the very agents to sterilize us in the water and in the
[3:28:21.560 --> 3:28:25.840]  food since 1950 and obviously the nocculations as well certainly helped
[3:28:25.840 --> 3:28:30.480]  along the way but now they're going into the what the rights now to mandate who
[3:28:30.480 --> 3:28:34.800]  can breed who cannot breed because it's not matter of overpopulation and
[3:28:34.800 --> 3:28:38.560]  all those statistics remember have been fudged since the days of Malthus he
[3:28:38.560 --> 3:28:42.920]  was grass and charts and fake statistics and but that doesn't matter as long as
[3:28:42.920 --> 3:28:47.560]  the public believe it because we must acquiesce by our silence to their demands
[3:28:47.560 --> 3:28:52.040]  they want the rights to to to literally sterilize people and that's been in the
[3:28:52.040 --> 3:28:56.640]  British newspapers quite recently so that's really what it's all about it's
[3:28:56.640 --> 3:29:01.160]  not there's too many people as too many of the wrong sort of people you know the
[3:29:01.160 --> 3:29:05.440]  ones who haven't evolved as far as those of the Bilderberger yeah yeah no they
[3:29:05.440 --> 3:29:09.320]  are they honestly believe that they should rule over us they're smarter than
[3:29:09.320 --> 3:29:13.040]  us they're more intelligent than us and then we are just we're a cannon fodder
[3:29:13.040 --> 3:29:17.520]  for them and we are being groomed to be a either dead or a slave race to serve
[3:29:17.520 --> 3:29:20.640]  them and I don't know about you but I'm not going to be licking any boots I'm
[3:29:20.640 --> 3:29:23.840]  not gonna be sucking my thumb in a fetal position just waiting them waiting
[3:29:23.840 --> 3:29:27.080]  for them to give me a Baxter vaccination that's gonna save me from the oh so
[3:29:27.080 --> 3:29:31.440]  dangerous swine flu oh no the swine flu is going to get us meanwhile we don't
[3:29:31.440 --> 3:29:35.640]  have any me repeat this any deaths in the United States the two-year-old boy
[3:29:35.640 --> 3:29:39.080]  that died had chronic health problems he was a premature baby he was from
[3:29:39.080 --> 3:29:43.160]  Mexico and we played you the clip where the Associated Press tries to say that
[3:29:43.160 --> 3:29:46.480]  swine flu killed this woman and then they have to go oh well actually it did
[3:29:46.480 --> 3:29:49.120]  you know they're falling short of that we'll be back after this taking your

[3:34:34.920 --> 3:34:39.960]  do health insurance and you know it's funny because I even had somebody from
[3:34:39.960 --> 3:34:43.760]  the post office call me back I had to go down there and think of a package
[3:34:43.760 --> 3:34:47.840]  because they screwed up a delivery and so the way that called me and this is
[3:34:47.840 --> 3:34:51.120]  what I'm doing I'm talking about being proactive because we've got this
[3:34:51.120 --> 3:34:56.720]  mentality I'm only one person what can I do well there's one person that you
[3:34:56.720 --> 3:34:59.960]  work with there that started that whole thing and look what's happened as a
[3:34:59.960 --> 3:35:04.120]  result what Alex has done well this woman from the post office I just happened
[3:35:04.120 --> 3:35:07.720]  to mention I said hey before you go I just want to ask you you're concerned
[3:35:07.720 --> 3:35:12.120]  about the economy and she said yeah and I said well would you like to know what's
[3:35:12.120 --> 3:35:17.080]  behind it and she said sure and I said okay and I gave her info wars I told
[3:35:17.080 --> 3:35:21.560]  her about the Obama deception I gave her Jason Burmese and Alex Jones told them
[3:35:21.560 --> 3:35:26.320]  when you guys are on and she goes you know my husband's really into talk radio
[3:35:26.320 --> 3:35:30.280]  and I said well if you're into talk radio you definitely want to listen to
[3:35:30.280 --> 3:35:34.560]  you guys and you definitely want to get a copy of the Obama deception and I mean
[3:35:34.560 --> 3:35:40.520]  I'm finding this more and more adjacent people overall are more and more open to
[3:35:40.520 --> 3:35:45.640]  listen because of the crisis that we're in I I've got a guy recently who has a
[3:35:45.640 --> 3:35:49.440]  good personal friend of mine this is what's really disappointing but he's
[3:35:49.440 --> 3:35:55.120]  been an exception where I actually emailed a link to the article on info
[3:35:55.120 --> 3:36:03.160]  wars about Ashley this kid the 16 year old kid that was taken by DHS you know
[3:36:03.160 --> 3:36:06.880]  two months ago in North Carolina but you understand wire just did a story
[3:36:06.880 --> 3:36:10.720]  bashing Alex Jones saying it doesn't exist oh he wasn't arrested right the
[3:36:10.720 --> 3:36:15.200]  Patriot Act oh you know you can't fake an IP address give me a break they went
[3:36:15.200 --> 3:36:18.080]  in in the middle of the night jackboot cops he hasn't been able to talk to his
[3:36:18.080 --> 3:36:21.920]  mother since what else could they be charging him with yeah and the thing is
[3:36:21.920 --> 3:36:25.760]  but this friend emails me back he says well I appreciate you send this to me
[3:36:25.760 --> 3:36:30.040]  and think about me but I don't adhere to these radical views so please don't
[3:36:30.040 --> 3:36:34.480]  send me anymore that kind of stuff so what I do I took like over an hour and I
[3:36:34.480 --> 3:36:37.920]  gave him a ton of details because he said I definitely don't agree with you
[3:36:37.920 --> 3:36:42.200]  saying that Bush the Bush family are a crime syndicate and I just gave him a
[3:36:42.200 --> 3:36:45.880]  ton of stuff that I knew and I haven't heard back from him since so hopefully
[3:36:45.880 --> 3:36:49.720]  it'll give him enough to think about but overall I found people are being more
[3:36:49.720 --> 3:36:54.080]  and more receptive to this message because they know something's up and they
[3:36:54.080 --> 3:36:57.560]  can see that there's something that's going down and if and I tell people if
[3:36:57.560 --> 3:37:01.560]  you don't wake up very soon we're not going to have any United States of
[3:37:01.560 --> 3:37:05.200]  America as we know we're going to be under and we do have to be proactive my
[3:37:05.200 --> 3:37:08.720]  friend and I thank you for the call let's jump to Bob in Wisconsin Bob you're on
[3:37:08.720 --> 3:37:16.640]  the line yes sir once twice Bob all right junior in New York you're on the
[3:37:16.640 --> 3:37:22.000]  air yes you guys hear me yes sir
[3:37:22.000 --> 3:37:26.360]  basically they passed through my neighborhood the other day doing the
[3:37:26.360 --> 3:37:29.960]  census and I wasn't here but my neighbor was here and I was curious like
[3:37:29.960 --> 3:37:34.880]  what could these GPS coordinates be for I know that you guys are saying SWAT
[3:37:34.880 --> 3:37:39.200]  teams but listen I don't want to say SWAT teams on you know that might be
[3:37:39.200 --> 3:37:43.160]  something Alex Jones has said and you know obviously they can use GPS
[3:37:43.160 --> 3:37:45.680]  coordinates if they want to get to your house and you're off the grid and you
[3:37:45.680 --> 3:37:50.480]  SWAT against you if you're a terrorist underlined in this DHS document but what
[3:37:50.480 --> 3:37:55.560]  it is is to create this massive control grid to document everybody's home and
[3:37:55.560 --> 3:38:00.560]  that's why the Census Bureau is going to every single house and GPSing outside
[3:38:00.560 --> 3:38:04.360]  of your house 40 feet at the least I want to you talk about that what do you
[3:38:04.360 --> 3:38:08.480]  think some of the can I do I want to actually ask Alan because I know he
[3:38:08.480 --> 3:38:12.440]  knows I don't I never really I just want to know if he thinks that there's any
[3:38:12.440 --> 3:38:17.240]  possibility that they could be using these coordinates with harp to zap
[3:38:17.240 --> 3:38:21.400]  targeted houses or you know they have certain people that they want to hit
[3:38:21.400 --> 3:38:29.680]  with the harp answer second but I just want to say this you know they're
[3:38:29.680 --> 3:38:33.720]  creating a database and a control grid so they know who to go after I don't
[3:38:33.720 --> 3:38:38.000]  think it has you know much to do with oh we're gonna GPS everybody and now we're
[3:38:38.000 --> 3:38:41.160]  gonna use harp weapons against them no they want to database everybody first
[3:38:41.160 --> 3:38:45.360]  put you in a different subcategory see who the real threats are see who the
[3:38:45.360 --> 3:38:49.920]  free thinkers are and then take action from there Alan what's your take back
[3:38:49.920 --> 3:38:55.680]  in the 70s I talked to a guy who worked for the British service the secret
[3:38:55.680 --> 3:39:00.600]  service and he told me he had a heart attack young fellow and he changed
[3:39:00.600 --> 3:39:04.800]  employment he was teaching at universities and he just mentioned one
[3:39:04.800 --> 3:39:09.360]  day that shortly there'll be a grid system it's already underway said set up
[3:39:09.360 --> 3:39:14.640]  for tracking via satellite everyone's homes and he said right now and that's
[3:39:14.640 --> 3:39:18.840]  true at that time we're all been trained to put down our postal codes even though
[3:39:18.840 --> 3:39:24.240]  the postal codes were not used by the post office for another 15 years it is
[3:39:24.240 --> 3:39:27.720]  we're presently treating the public to always write their postal code is says
[3:39:27.720 --> 3:39:32.680]  because eventually everyone will be categorized under various codes that's
[3:39:32.680 --> 3:39:36.600]  all he would say but what he really meant I think was political codes etc
[3:39:36.600 --> 3:39:42.000]  viewpoints and so on so that was part of it and that was literally 1972
[3:39:42.000 --> 3:39:45.840]  I mean this is just an extension of the control grid don't you I mean they want
[3:39:45.840 --> 3:39:50.280]  to get people that are off the grid they want you to be a part of this huge
[3:39:50.280 --> 3:39:53.560]  control grid where they can zoom in on your house from a satellite they know
[3:39:53.560 --> 3:39:58.680]  exactly where you live who you are and they have that data data data and they
[3:39:58.680 --> 3:40:03.560]  do flyovers to and if they want to check out your house they can infrared it
[3:40:03.560 --> 3:40:06.560]  and see what's in it and all the rest of it there's a whole bunch of reasons they
[3:40:06.560 --> 3:40:11.080]  can use it but also remember that they're always working on the future and in the
[3:40:11.080 --> 3:40:15.640]  future for gender 21 depending on where you are and which region and area you're
[3:40:15.640 --> 3:40:19.440]  in and they do have regions marked down across the US and Canada they want to get
[3:40:19.440 --> 3:40:25.120]  us all off over the next 15 16 years off the land and into the overcrowded
[3:40:25.120 --> 3:40:30.040]  cities so I probably all tied together many functions all in one the one thing
[3:40:30.040 --> 3:40:34.320]  going on right now and I'll be part to do with that as well also remember they're
[3:40:34.320 --> 3:40:38.600]  going after the US just passing that law put that law through where they own all
[3:40:38.600 --> 3:40:42.880]  water in the United States internally so if you happen to be on top of a nice
[3:40:42.880 --> 3:40:46.160]  deep well or something like that so they might just want that
[3:40:46.160 --> 3:40:48.400]  or they might not like you have access to your own water
[3:40:48.400 --> 3:40:50.960]  it's a whole bunch of reasons that they're doing this for its old data
[3:40:50.960 --> 3:40:54.960]  collection for every facet of your life well let's say they also pass this bill
[3:40:54.960 --> 3:40:57.600]  where you're not supposed to have an organic farm it's going to be a lot
[3:40:57.600 --> 3:41:01.600]  easier for them once they GPS your house realize how big it is to just check
[3:41:01.600 --> 3:41:04.880]  their satellite and say oh my god this guy's got a victory garden he's a
[3:41:04.880 --> 3:41:08.680]  terrorist let's go get him I mean it's a total surveillance total control grid
[3:41:08.680 --> 3:41:12.240]  and that's why they want that information yes and that was all part of the
[3:41:12.240 --> 3:41:16.560]  star war the real star wars program was all for the for the future for purchase
[3:41:16.560 --> 3:41:22.320]  now and what's coming up and tracking and coordinating etc it's all part of it
[3:41:22.320 --> 3:41:25.760]  so when they come to you personally and do it in your home remember even the guy
[3:41:25.760 --> 3:41:30.280]  who reached your your electric meter punches that little GPS satellite when
[3:41:30.280 --> 3:41:35.240]  he punches in the meter readings he also punches in where he is they've been
[3:41:35.240 --> 3:41:39.960]  doing this for years absolutely let's jump to Devin in California Devin you're
[3:41:39.960 --> 3:41:48.440]  on the air yes hey how you doing guys good we got you Devin you fall off Greg
[3:41:48.440 --> 3:41:52.800]  from Florida you're on the air Greg man we just can't get these phones right
[3:41:52.800 --> 3:41:59.120]  take my call you got it well yes sir hey I just wanted to go over a few things
[3:41:59.120 --> 3:42:05.920]  I uh I'm I was in the US military I got out in 2004 and I'll tell you when I went
[3:42:05.920 --> 3:42:11.880]  to boot camp in Arizona, South Carolina we had like probably what happened
[3:42:11.880 --> 3:42:18.320]  between was foreigners and our entire platoon graduated from boot camp
[3:42:18.320 --> 3:42:24.640]  including one foreigner who was on light duty the entire time he didn't do any
[3:42:24.640 --> 3:42:29.840]  of the runs with us none of the hikes with us anything was really sad all right
[3:42:29.840 --> 3:42:33.600]  well you hold on one second I just want you to speak to that why don't you
[3:42:33.600 --> 3:42:38.720]  explain to people Alan how we are now being you know our military is being
[3:42:38.720 --> 3:42:43.040]  integrated with NATO and foreign military forces for this new global
[3:42:43.040 --> 3:42:48.520]  system well under the plan for I think it was called Fortress America it was in
[3:42:48.520 --> 3:42:54.720]  the papers maybe three years ago or 90 2005 and fight they said that the
[3:42:54.720 --> 3:42:58.920]  Canadian forces US Mexican and other Latin American countries were already
[3:42:58.920 --> 3:43:03.360]  amalgamating but the second part of it all was you've seen as the paper too
[3:43:03.360 --> 3:43:08.280]  that not only will they eat the whole of America's amalgamate but now to amalgamate
[3:43:08.280 --> 3:43:13.520]  also with the European Union community so they're great they're creating a new
[3:43:13.520 --> 3:43:19.360]  world army that's been in the press and the European papers a world army and
[3:43:19.360 --> 3:43:25.440]  every country will send members to a three part of this world army so this is
[3:43:25.440 --> 3:43:31.160]  all part of it is the multicultural force I think about 15 years ago in the
[3:43:31.160 --> 3:43:36.560]  the the Council of Foreign Relations own magazine foreign affairs they said it
[3:43:36.560 --> 3:43:41.000]  had world meetings to discuss how to create this new world army because it
[3:43:41.000 --> 3:43:44.060]  was one thing it was easier to get you to stand up for your old tribal
[3:43:44.060 --> 3:43:48.760]  emblems your flag etc the songs and all that and the uniforms but how would they
[3:43:48.760 --> 3:43:53.200]  make create a cohesive international army and so they were they put whole
[3:43:53.200 --> 3:43:58.600]  whole groups of specialists on that particular problem at the Council of
[3:43:58.600 --> 3:44:02.320]  Foreign Relations they're still working on it to create this integrated force
[3:44:02.320 --> 3:44:06.200]  and as long as we pay them very well as always it's down to the same thing and
[3:44:06.200 --> 3:44:10.440]  create the brotherhood idea that they're special more special than the
[3:44:10.440 --> 3:44:14.560]  civilians than they hope to use these techniques to bind them together and to
[3:44:14.560 --> 3:44:18.200]  truly international force so it's quite right we're going through that now we
[3:44:18.200 --> 3:44:22.080]  have been for quite a few years yeah but it's really in full force right now I
[3:44:22.080 --> 3:44:25.040]  mean we're talking about you know earlier today we talked about Marine Corp
[3:44:25.040 --> 3:44:28.880]  civilian police and we have another military guy call in and say yeah a lot
[3:44:28.880 --> 3:44:32.760]  of my guys are getting deployed and now it's dudes who are making $14 an hour
[3:44:32.760 --> 3:44:36.560]  who we hire off the street not the MPs anymore and that's because they are
[3:44:36.560 --> 3:44:39.880]  first of all integrating a police state here at home they're trying to blur the
[3:44:39.880 --> 3:44:42.960]  lines between the military and the police are trying to get rid of posi
[3:44:42.960 --> 3:44:46.600]  commentatus and they're getting us ready for global government and a global
[3:44:46.600 --> 3:44:51.440]  military force that you're going to see at the national level exercise 09 coming
[3:44:51.440 --> 3:44:55.760]  up at the end of July into the beginning of August headed by FEMA you know
[3:44:55.760 --> 3:45:02.160]  working with the UK Australia Canada and Mexico in a terrorist prevention act
[3:45:02.160 --> 3:45:06.280]  like no one has ever seen this is the first drill to prevent terror after
[3:45:06.280 --> 3:45:10.160]  terrorism occurs in another country let's jump to our next caller and in
[3:45:10.160 --> 3:45:16.360]  New York you're on the line I just want to say that I'm new to you and I'm so
[3:45:16.360 --> 3:45:19.560]  proud that you are doing what you're doing that there's a place that there's
[3:45:19.560 --> 3:45:24.680]  a voice that we can hear that that is just focusing on what's really going on
[3:45:24.680 --> 3:45:28.960]  well thank you and thank you the end and I want to touch on three things I'm
[3:45:28.960 --> 3:45:33.440]  gonna be real quick I'll share this with you I have two different passports
[3:45:33.440 --> 3:45:37.880]  plus a green card and I was recently robbed and I had to go and get my state
[3:45:37.880 --> 3:45:45.720]  ID back now I got my state ID originally four years ago and when I went to get it
[3:45:45.720 --> 3:45:49.640]  back there is they have now added something to the form in New York City
[3:45:49.640 --> 3:45:55.520]  which makes you divulge whether you have ever had a Canadian driver's license if
[3:45:55.520 --> 3:46:00.200]  you have an active one and it makes you put down your driver's license number on
[3:46:00.200 --> 3:46:05.600]  this form well right now is enforcing a new ID system and where if you take the
[3:46:05.600 --> 3:46:10.120]  new ID card I think they're going to be issuing them on your first no no I
[3:46:10.120 --> 3:46:12.800]  understand that but we're right now well they're trying to blur the line they're
[3:46:12.800 --> 3:46:16.800]  trying to create this North American Union so if you take your RFID national ID
[3:46:16.800 --> 3:46:19.760]  card in Canada then you won't have to wait in the border you'll just have your
[3:46:19.760 --> 3:46:22.640]  thing oh you got your card go ahead and they're gonna do the same thing in
[3:46:22.640 --> 3:46:27.800]  Mexico and America they want to integrate this into a a new system and
[3:46:27.800 --> 3:46:31.800]  that was exposed in the security and part prosperity's partnership agreements
[3:46:31.800 --> 3:46:36.200]  why don't you speak to that really quickly there Alan yes and also the the EU
[3:46:36.200 --> 3:46:39.680]  have said that they have a central computer with all the data of Canadians
[3:46:39.680 --> 3:46:43.400]  and the US citizens who have that card so it isn't an actual fact an
[3:46:43.400 --> 3:46:48.280]  international issue international ID card exactly under the it even said that
[3:46:48.280 --> 3:46:51.200]  in it they could go under the guise of a license that matter it is the
[3:46:51.200 --> 3:46:56.720]  international ID card exactly and what else you got for me it's here yeah
[3:46:56.720 --> 3:47:00.680]  yeah no we know it's a writing card you know and I'm just so glad you're
[3:47:00.680 --> 3:47:06.640]  alerting more and more Americans and the bill HR 875 how realistic is that I
[3:47:06.640 --> 3:47:11.800]  mean I've sent letters to the New York Times to even food to every organic
[3:47:11.800 --> 3:47:15.520]  group that I can think of and any response I've gotten back from organic
[3:47:15.520 --> 3:47:18.720]  farmers is that they've never even heard of this well at that's that's
[3:47:18.720 --> 3:47:21.240]  absolutely correct they haven't heard of it and they're keeping it on the low
[3:47:21.240 --> 3:47:26.200]  but it's as real as it gets they always talk about it after they've passed some
[3:47:26.200 --> 3:47:30.320]  kind of legislation towards it they've they have programmed us to think that
[3:47:30.320 --> 3:47:34.160]  GMO foods are going to save us and you don't need organic farming in fact
[3:47:34.160 --> 3:47:37.400]  organic farming is bad because it doesn't go through the proper processes
[3:47:37.400 --> 3:47:41.360]  it and that's the reason we have swine flu and bird flu outbreaks and people
[3:47:41.360 --> 3:47:46.320]  are unhealthy meanwhile these GMO foods are set out to destroy our immune
[3:47:46.320 --> 3:47:51.840]  systems to really hurt us to sterilize us speak to that Alan there's no doubt
[3:47:51.840 --> 3:47:56.600]  about it there I talk and I read from their own articles the big players on
[3:47:56.600 --> 3:48:01.320]  depopulation agendas I keep asking the public what do you think they mean by
[3:48:01.320 --> 3:48:05.520]  that it just a wish list of things they'd love to do at Christmas time in
[3:48:05.520 --> 3:48:09.960]  Santa Clause they actually implement them you cannot ask for volunteers so
[3:48:09.960 --> 3:48:13.760]  you simply implement them and you're quite right for the GMO food I mean look
[3:48:13.760 --> 3:48:18.000]  at all this the guys behind Obama is input guys there who work from Monsanto
[3:48:18.000 --> 3:48:21.400]  on his staff there and they in fact they put the bills forward for this
[3:48:21.400 --> 3:48:25.440]  particular one and we've had it from the economic union we've had from Britain
[3:48:25.440 --> 3:48:29.800]  from all the prime ministers they want the GMO to be the sole ruler basically
[3:48:29.800 --> 3:48:34.040]  food-wise for the whole planet that's the way it's been mandated that's why no
[3:48:34.040 --> 3:48:39.040]  one can sue Monsanto anywhere that's why doors open for Monsanto and judges
[3:48:39.040 --> 3:48:42.760]  not to leave them alone it's a must-be because as far as I'm concerned you see
[3:48:42.760 --> 3:48:46.600]  food comes under military industrial complex is the oldest trick in the book
[3:48:46.600 --> 3:48:51.040]  control the food or the water you control the people therefore Monsanto is
[3:48:51.040 --> 3:48:55.520]  part of the military industrial complex absolutely and I hope you look into
[3:48:55.520 --> 3:48:59.320]  Codex elementarius there's a lot of scary things within that I thank you for
[3:48:59.320 --> 3:49:04.520]  the call let's jump to Johnny and Indiana Johnny are online yes I'm all
[3:49:04.520 --> 3:49:09.640]  Jason can hearing yes sir I want to comment about action the action
[3:49:09.640 --> 3:49:15.120]  lumpy case okay it's here in my town in south in Indiana and I heard about it on
[3:49:15.120 --> 3:49:19.720]  your show and I became actively involved in her case and I brought it to
[3:49:19.720 --> 3:49:25.520]  attention of all my media outlets and that they create such such a an outcry
[3:49:25.520 --> 3:49:29.560]  that the U.S. Attorney had to respond with it with a press release and what
[3:49:29.560 --> 3:49:36.120]  did they say they downplayed it they commented on the charges and and I
[3:49:36.120 --> 3:49:39.440]  talked in it to another least three times a day since I heard about the case
[3:49:39.440 --> 3:49:45.160]  and they commented on what he was being charged with and they said that she had
[3:49:45.160 --> 3:49:50.200]  access to her child but that never bothered to go see him and you know
[3:49:50.200 --> 3:49:54.000]  again I you know I've got to know more about this case but I don't think it's
[3:49:54.000 --> 3:49:57.120]  right that you come in the middle of the night you pick up a 16-year-old kid
[3:49:57.120 --> 3:50:01.480]  because of a supposed bomb threat the kid seems to have an alibi the mother's
[3:50:01.480 --> 3:50:04.520]  telling a different story from what the authorities are telling you know time
[3:50:04.520 --> 3:50:08.560]  will tell whether this pans out or not and you know I encourage people to go
[3:50:08.560 --> 3:50:12.760]  check into it themselves let's jump to Bill in what do we got Bill in
[3:50:12.760 --> 3:50:17.920]  Connecticut you're on the air yeah Connecticut yep you're doing Jason how
[3:50:17.920 --> 3:50:24.480]  you doing sir good hey um couple things are pertaining to HR 875 I was just
[3:50:24.480 --> 3:50:26.640]  trying to find it here because I was gonna email it over to you but I
[3:50:26.640 --> 3:50:31.200]  actually got a response back from Jim Himes pretending to that because the
[3:50:31.200 --> 3:50:35.840]  the rose what's her name the low Delarosa or Rosa I think I'm Delarosa
[3:50:35.840 --> 3:50:40.120]  the Laurel was the woman who trapped with that out I thought it was
[3:50:40.120 --> 3:50:44.200]  interesting because in his response he was basically saying that she was not
[3:50:44.200 --> 3:50:50.320]  married to you know one of the guys that actually works at Monsanto
[3:50:50.320 --> 3:50:55.160]  seems Greenberg but but she is married to this guy right hold over on the
[3:50:55.160 --> 3:50:59.000]  other side we'll be back after this it's the Alex Jones show or with Alan Watt

[3:52:11.000 --> 3:52:15.920]  kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see the Obama deception
[3:52:15.920 --> 3:52:20.080]  completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the
[3:52:20.080 --> 3:52:24.920]  American people while Obama's already fudging yeah but since day one in this

[3:55:18.120 --> 3:55:22.520]  copy of the letter that I had gotten from Jim Himes mm-hmm he's basically
[3:55:22.520 --> 3:55:25.120]  sitting there saying that you know he doesn't you know he's gonna vote this
[3:55:25.120 --> 3:55:28.200]  down so so forth but he actually did address that thing and they're
[3:55:28.200 --> 3:55:32.600]  pertaining to her husband I called his office well whether they're related or
[3:55:32.600 --> 3:55:36.520]  not this is a bad bill we should be able to go on our own oh it's an awful
[3:55:36.520 --> 3:55:40.480]  bill you're right it's off the charts awful and we do need to oppose it I
[3:55:40.480 --> 3:55:45.080]  thank you for the call bill Alan what are your clothing closing thoughts on
[3:55:45.080 --> 3:55:48.480]  this bill I mean a lot of people are obviously concerned you know we don't
[3:55:48.480 --> 3:55:54.360]  want Monsanto in charge of our our food consumption do we know but I think
[3:55:54.360 --> 3:56:02.520]  to be honest with you it already is the Monsanto Archer Daniels Midlands and a
[3:56:02.520 --> 3:56:07.080]  few others as five of them all together were set up to take over and be that
[3:56:07.080 --> 3:56:11.120]  that the big agribusiness companies for the entire planet they're in every
[3:56:11.120 --> 3:56:15.440]  country across the planet doing the same things at the same time and with a top
[3:56:15.440 --> 3:56:20.080]  politicians prime ministers come out in Europe saying that they're going to make
[3:56:20.080 --> 3:56:26.760]  it like they give a complete go-ahead to be GMO everything GMO the United
[3:56:26.760 --> 3:56:30.240]  Nations remember the Department of Agriculture said when they were set up
[3:56:30.240 --> 3:56:35.500]  their job eventually was to distribute all food across the world to every block
[3:56:35.500 --> 3:56:41.440]  that's the US block the European block etc and they said that that will be used
[3:56:41.440 --> 3:56:45.320]  as coercion to bring down their populations you won't get more rations
[3:56:45.320 --> 3:56:50.200]  if you have more populations or simply reduce it so as uses a weapon and the
[3:56:50.200 --> 3:56:54.360]  woman who was in charge of the UN at that time for that department said that
[3:56:54.360 --> 3:56:59.400]  food has always been used as a weapon but I understand it still is and the old
[3:56:59.400 --> 3:57:05.560]  ideas of freedom and being self-sufficient are under the hammer because in an
[3:57:05.560 --> 3:57:09.360]  interdependent world and what they mean by interdependence is right down to
[3:57:09.360 --> 3:57:13.080]  personal interdependence it means you will be dependent on them and their
[3:57:13.080 --> 3:57:17.880]  system for everything you need to live exactly no more individualities no more
[3:57:17.880 --> 3:57:22.640]  individual human rights and that's why they put that in that WHO document so
[3:57:22.640 --> 3:57:26.520]  that they can quarantine you vaccinate you and kill you if they want that's the
[3:57:26.520 --> 3:57:29.720]  bottom line Alan Watt thank you for joining us the website is cutting
