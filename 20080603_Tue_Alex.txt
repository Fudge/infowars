[00:00.000 --> 00:07.640]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the
[00:07.640 --> 00:15.480]  GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones we had a very
[00:15.480 --> 00:22.320]  powerful interview with the former head of Arnie intelligence general
[00:22.320 --> 00:27.640]  stubblebine and his wife who's a medical doctor they've been doing their own
[00:27.640 --> 00:30.520]  studying since the last time I had him on about a year and a half ago and they
[00:30.520 --> 00:34.600]  come to the conclusion there's a worldwide eugenics extermination program
[00:34.600 --> 00:38.600]  and I had him on about the fact that George Clooney's making a movie about
[00:38.600 --> 00:42.040]  general stubblebine and then they weren't even aware of that and got off into all
[00:42.040 --> 00:45.600]  the other issues and from their own separate research had discovered what
[00:45.600 --> 00:51.280]  we've discovered and they were going over the fact that half of the people in
[00:51.280 --> 00:55.960]  the country at current rates will either get cancer that almost kills them or
[00:55.960 --> 01:03.600]  does kill them by the age of 20 in fact most parents will be outliving their
[01:03.600 --> 01:10.440]  children now as the massive black op is put into high gear and that dovetailed
[01:10.440 --> 01:15.480]  with them being spot-on about New York and other states simultaneously we've
[01:15.480 --> 01:19.600]  now discovered it's a bunch of states trying to pass mandatory vaccine laws
[01:19.600 --> 01:25.520]  other states Supreme Court of Minnesota just ruled no Fourth Amendment police
[01:25.520 --> 01:29.800]  anytime they want will take blood at checkpoints from the citizens and this
[01:29.800 --> 01:32.960]  is a way to get you ready for forced inoculations they admit the police
[01:32.960 --> 01:39.800]  cadres have been training since 2002 for forced inoculation mass roundups 26,000
[01:39.800 --> 01:44.120]  preachers trained giving sermons weekly telling their flocks to hand their guns
[01:44.120 --> 01:49.480]  in go to camps take inoculations that it's some type of holy sacrament we told
[01:49.480 --> 01:52.080]  you this of course a year and a half before it was declassified and made
[01:52.080 --> 01:56.760]  public again we're very credible ladies and gentlemen we know the enemy attack
[01:56.760 --> 02:01.440]  pattern we're warning you the compartmentalized police and military
[02:01.440 --> 02:05.280]  don't know what they're part of most of social workers don't the FBI doesn't
[02:05.280 --> 02:10.080]  general stubble bind ran all of army intelligence two-star general and he
[02:10.080 --> 02:16.000]  didn't know about this till he retired in the 1990s former commander of army
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.400]  special forces before that combat veteran multiple wars and he'll tell you
[02:21.400 --> 02:24.960]  what's really going on when we come back in the next segment here's some of the
[02:24.960 --> 02:29.480]  news oil prices George Soros warns that speculators could trigger stock market
[02:29.480 --> 02:34.960]  crash talking about himself the great oil swindle how much did the Fed really
[02:34.960 --> 02:39.000]  know Mike Whitney does an article for online journal and some of the increase
[02:39.000 --> 02:42.280]  about 30% according to the experts we've interviewed in the numbers is from
[02:42.280 --> 02:46.600]  speculation 70% roughly of oil price increase in the aggregate in the last
[02:46.600 --> 02:51.000]  five years is dollar devaluation so that's in a way that's a red herring a
[02:51.000 --> 02:55.600]  canard a scapegoat a diversion of distraction while Congress grandstands
[02:55.600 --> 03:01.080]  parents could face court for letting children try alcohol in Texas and at
[03:01.080 --> 03:05.760]  least last time I checked the law you are allowed to give your child a beer in
[03:05.760 --> 03:10.240]  Europe they've always served their children watered down beer and wine in
[03:10.240 --> 03:13.760]  Italy they do and you actually have less alcoholism in places where they have
[03:13.760 --> 03:17.520]  that they don't care now though we have if anybody thinks they've seen your
[03:17.520 --> 03:21.800]  child or your child accidentally grabs a beer off a table and drinks it your
[03:21.800 --> 03:24.680]  children are gone and the government will put more than two-thirds of them on
[03:24.680 --> 03:29.120]  brain-wadding psychotropic hundreds of times worse than alcohol because they
[03:29.120 --> 03:34.280]  are the criminal group to carry out the murder of our children as publicly put
[03:34.280 --> 03:40.520]  into official U.S. government policy 1973 PDD's and of course say part my
[03:40.520 --> 03:46.680]  random 200 world leaders tone down menu over fears of hypocrisy part of all of
[03:46.680 --> 03:51.600]  the fake greenhouse footprint emissions where they say they don't fly and they
[03:51.600 --> 03:54.760]  don't eat a lot and Barack Obama says the government's gonna control how much
[03:54.760 --> 03:57.640]  you can eat they're getting you ready for all of this while not letting you
[03:57.640 --> 04:00.920]  know it's GMO and so they're gonna it says the Times of London says they're
[04:00.920 --> 04:04.480]  gonna eat less at the events to train you that you're not gonna be getting
[04:04.480 --> 04:11.720]  food now all engineered all controlled all these stunts as we told you they're
[04:11.720 --> 04:15.560]  closing down most the SUV factories in the country and see it's all gonna
[04:15.560 --> 04:19.120]  change now and they openly say your journey towards enslavement will be
[04:19.120 --> 04:23.920]  completed Senate votes to begin global warming debate that means they'll never

[04:49.960 --> 04:54.560]  Jason Burma sitting in as I get ready to leave doctors around the world claim
[04:54.560 --> 04:58.240]  that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline
[04:58.240 --> 05:02.640]  environment but as you know most people are overly acidic due to stress acidic
[05:02.640 --> 05:07.160]  diet and lack of exercise pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and
[05:07.160 --> 05:11.160]  perfect health as well as prevention of disease people who alkalized the water
[05:11.160 --> 05:15.360]  they drink experience normalized blood sugar mental clarity and loss of weight
[05:15.360 --> 05:19.720]  it was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water but due to modern way of
[05:19.720 --> 05:24.240]  life most people are overly acidic the fact is that disease simply cannot exist
[05:24.240 --> 05:27.840]  in an alkaline environment fat accumulates if a person consumes too much
[05:27.840 --> 05:32.440]  acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it do your part alkalize and

[06:59.200 --> 07:02.480]  though we're paying record prices at the pump I have run across a company called
[07:02.480 --> 07:07.200]  SFR who has developed two products that improve gas mileage instead of paying a
[07:07.200 --> 07:11.280]  mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system protect a complete
[07:11.280 --> 07:16.520]  fuel system treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition improving mileage
[07:16.520 --> 07:20.080]  and only one tank full protect the engine treatment not only reduces friction
[07:20.080 --> 07:24.200]  but it extends the life of your engine let's face it with the high price of
[07:24.200 --> 07:27.640]  gasoline it's time to take action purchase a protective fuel system
[07:27.640 --> 07:32.800]  treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95
[07:32.800 --> 07:40.200]  value free call triple 8 use SFR 1 that number again is triple 8 use SFR 1 or

[07:58.040 --> 08:04.880]  brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[08:04.880 --> 08:12.440]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[08:12.440 --> 08:15.880]  Alex Jones
[08:20.600 --> 08:28.720]  we've got medical doctor Rima Labo on the line with us and of course major
[08:28.720 --> 08:36.320]  general stubble bind as well they don't do a lot of radio interviews they don't
[08:36.320 --> 08:39.520]  really like to mainstream media they have their own very well-known health
[08:39.520 --> 08:44.160]  website with a lot of powerful and well-documented information and of course
[08:44.160 --> 08:48.760]  general stubble bind ran different sectors of the army ran special forces
[08:48.760 --> 08:53.920]  after that he was the head of all army intelligence two-star general and of
[08:53.920 --> 09:00.800]  course his wife of many years a medical doctor labo is just an amazing lady and
[09:00.800 --> 09:04.080]  I had him on yesterday and I guess it got lost in translation because they're
[09:04.080 --> 09:11.080]  they're down there setting up a research facility down in Panama that I wanted
[09:11.080 --> 09:15.920]  him on about George Clooney is making a big movie about him and this was just
[09:15.920 --> 09:20.760]  announced well about a week ago so I wasn't surprised they hadn't heard about
[09:20.760 --> 09:24.360]  it but then they wanted to move on past that I understand why because so what
[09:24.360 --> 09:30.400]  about Hollywood what really matters is that they have done research on the
[09:30.400 --> 09:37.280]  globalist eugenics operations they're planned to exterminate 89% of us they're
[09:37.280 --> 09:42.520]  carrying this out through soft kill operations they're carrying this out
[09:42.520 --> 09:49.200]  all over the world this is happening so we have major general Albert stubble
[09:49.200 --> 09:55.520]  bind the third commanding general of the United States Army intelligence and
[09:55.520 --> 09:59.760]  security command and of course before that he was the head of many different
[09:59.760 --> 10:08.040]  sectors of the army and he's also in documentary one nation under siege where
[10:08.040 --> 10:11.720]  he states that a Boeing 757 airplane could not have crashed in the Pentagon
[10:11.720 --> 10:15.400]  of September 11th and left that 16-foot hole but that's another issue that we
[10:15.400 --> 10:19.160]  may raise with him some today but mainly I've got him in the next 50 minutes with
[10:19.160 --> 10:24.240]  us to continue part two because in an hour we only have about 40 minutes 45
[10:24.240 --> 10:28.160]  minutes of airtime to finish up what they were talking about I want to go
[10:28.160 --> 10:36.360]  first to Dr. Rima Labo MD because right at the end she was trying to give out and
[10:36.360 --> 10:40.160]  I've seen these statistics myself the government admits these current cancer
[10:40.160 --> 10:44.520]  statistics versus what they were when she graduated from medical school in 1970
[10:44.520 --> 10:48.840]  versus what they were in the 40s I have those numbers the 40s of course it was
[10:48.840 --> 10:53.200]  one in 33 would die of cancer people only lived supposedly you know three more
[10:53.200 --> 10:56.800]  years now so those it's not living longer it's doing that people actually live
[10:56.800 --> 11:01.200]  less long now because before we had more infant mortality so they would average
[11:01.200 --> 11:05.080]  that in but people actually if you live past the age of 10 on average you did
[11:05.080 --> 11:08.400]  live longer so they also cook those numbers if you look at it we're not
[11:08.400 --> 11:14.520]  living as long and cancer has gone from one in 33 to one in three now they're
[11:14.520 --> 11:18.840]  talking about one and two this is not just toxins in the environment this is
[11:18.840 --> 11:22.600]  the GMO the rest of it but I want her as a medical doctor to go over this first
[11:22.600 --> 11:26.960]  and then bring in general stubble bind from his intelligence background his
[11:26.960 --> 11:31.600]  military background kind of reverse engineering what sectors are running
[11:31.600 --> 11:35.960]  this massive black operation against us which even though he was the head of
[11:35.960 --> 11:40.000]  intelligence he didn't know about because it was so compartmentalized on need
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.360]  to know so we'll get him to explain to us compartmentalization and how that
[11:43.360 --> 11:49.640]  works Dr. Labo thank you for coming on with us oh it's our pleasure Alex get
[11:49.640 --> 11:53.960]  into you I mean you've got the floor give us the numbers give us the facts why
[11:53.960 --> 11:58.720]  from the medical research why we know this is all skyrocketing how it's
[11:58.720 --> 12:03.440]  engineered first of all let's understand that cancer is a disease that the
[12:03.440 --> 12:08.120]  establishment does not want to cure it is the most profitable disease that
[12:08.120 --> 12:14.920]  humankind has ever encountered millions of dollars per patient go into the
[12:14.920 --> 12:19.960]  alleged treatment of cancer there are lots of cures as a physician using only
[12:19.960 --> 12:24.600]  natural methods no drugs people would come to me in extremists people would
[12:24.600 --> 12:28.600]  come to me who had been told that they had and I love this phrase failed
[12:28.600 --> 12:32.640]  conventional treatment it wasn't that the treatment failed them it was that
[12:32.640 --> 12:37.560]  they had failed conventional treatment and they would be told that there was
[12:37.560 --> 12:41.600]  nothing left to do for them so they were going to die they'd come to me as they
[12:41.600 --> 12:46.440]  come to many physicians who practice natural medicine long after their immune
[12:46.440 --> 12:52.720]  systems had been assaulted terminally according to the medical establishment
[12:52.720 --> 12:58.320]  by chemotherapy which kills people and radiation which kills people and the
[12:58.320 --> 13:03.560]  combination of course kills them even faster but it's so profitable and they
[13:03.560 --> 13:08.120]  would then be willing to put themselves into the hands of a physician who was
[13:08.120 --> 13:13.520]  going to use natural treatment and most of the time these people actually wound
[13:13.520 --> 13:18.760]  up not dying from cancer they wound up radiantly healthy because what we did
[13:18.760 --> 13:25.880]  was feed and restore the immune system whose primary jobs include getting rid
[13:25.880 --> 13:31.520]  of cancers in the body so when you suppress the immune system with free
[13:31.520 --> 13:37.000]  radicals and irradiated food gives you just an astounding number of those and
[13:37.000 --> 13:43.920]  with pesticides like the pesticides that Codex Alimentarius has brought back
[13:43.920 --> 13:49.560]  despite the fact that the world has banned them in the Stockholm convention
[13:49.560 --> 13:58.040]  in 2001 and other toxic and and the fact that many of the pesticides have no
[13:58.040 --> 14:04.640]  upper limits according to Codex and when you include hormones and subclinical
[14:04.640 --> 14:08.120]  antibiotics and give the animals vaccines that people eat and use
[14:08.120 --> 14:12.240]  genetically modified organisms which are beyond deadly both for the
[14:12.240 --> 14:19.840]  environment and for people put all this together and you have a global immune
[14:19.840 --> 14:25.320]  vulnerability then naturally cancer is going to develop you add to this of
[14:25.320 --> 14:30.360]  course electromagnetic pollution and the other environmental degradations and
[14:30.360 --> 14:39.080]  Shazam you've got rising cancer rates now the the statistics are horrifying as I
[14:39.080 --> 14:44.920]  said yesterday when we were talking together when I was in medical school
[14:44.920 --> 14:50.280]  and I graduated in 1970 from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine if a child
[14:50.280 --> 14:56.160]  had any kind of cancer other than a malignancy of the kidney called Wilms
[14:56.160 --> 15:00.560]  tumor all of the medical students and all of the interns and residents were
[15:00.560 --> 15:04.920]  brought to gawk at the child didn't help the kid very much but it was supposed
[15:04.920 --> 15:08.960]  to be part of our medical this was like seeing a unicorn this was incredibly
[15:08.960 --> 15:15.400]  rare wow look at that here's a kid with cancer wow that doesn't happen very
[15:15.400 --> 15:19.720]  often of course now what we're looking at according to the World Health
[15:19.720 --> 15:25.480]  Organization and the environmental working group is that for children born
[15:25.480 --> 15:31.560]  after the year 2000 in the year 2000 and after their parents are statistically
[15:31.560 --> 15:37.240]  likely to outlive them that's a first in human history their parents are
[15:37.240 --> 15:43.080]  statistically likely I want to stop you doctor medical doctor I want to stop you
[15:43.080 --> 15:45.640]  right there and I've seen all these same numbers I want listeners understand
[15:45.640 --> 15:50.400]  she's telling you the absolute truth go look it up for yourself CDC government
[15:50.400 --> 15:54.280]  admits this but but they don't popularize these numbers they keep it under
[15:54.280 --> 16:01.800]  a hat this is evidence of a massive complete die-off and attack on our
[16:01.800 --> 16:06.480]  population and you go read the government documents they say back in the
[16:06.480 --> 16:10.480]  30s they were going to carry this out so we're going to talk about the evidence
[16:10.480 --> 16:13.680]  of what's happened and then the evidence of why they're doing it and how it's
[16:13.680 --> 16:17.800]  engineered by design and doctor what you believe is the greatest contributing
[16:17.800 --> 16:25.080]  factor to that continue with the numbers so thank you Alex the I want to point out
[16:25.080 --> 16:31.640]  that vaccines and right now New York State is cooking up a new law that will
[16:31.640 --> 16:37.960]  allow the committee the advisory committee on immunization practices of
[16:37.960 --> 16:45.800]  the CDC to set the mandatory vaccine schedule for every I underline the word
[16:45.800 --> 16:51.440]  every child in New York without any exemptions that's right I read the bill
[16:51.440 --> 16:55.640]  and even people writing articles for my website great folks don't understand
[16:55.640 --> 16:58.760]  people are saying in the comment section oh I just won't put them in
[16:58.760 --> 17:03.640]  government schools the bill says everybody the bill says everybody that
[17:03.640 --> 17:07.600]  they're going to send police coming for your children with the cancer laden
[17:07.600 --> 17:13.880]  injections as they did in Maryland as where there are exemptions and as you
[17:13.880 --> 17:18.360]  have pointed out rightly Glenn Ivy the state's attorney who perpetrated this
[17:18.360 --> 17:23.800]  atrocity on 2300 children with compulsory vaccination including 1100 who
[17:23.800 --> 17:28.360]  were already fully vaccinated but whose records the schools the school admitted
[17:28.360 --> 17:34.160]  it had lost Glenn Ivy as you have said and as we have written refuses to
[17:34.160 --> 17:40.480]  vaccinate his kids but it's good enough for poor under educated parents to be
[17:40.480 --> 17:47.720]  bullied into so 2300 kids were exposed to compulsory vaccination in a courthouse
[17:47.720 --> 17:52.000]  with the judge laughing and saying it was kind of cute the kids were crying it
[17:52.000 --> 17:55.880]  was like going to Sunday school we're talking about institutionalized
[17:55.880 --> 18:01.880]  craziness here it is mass psychopathic evil work in part mentalized minions
[18:01.880 --> 18:06.000]  pull the levers of doom only because they're ordered to to keep their petty
[18:06.000 --> 18:11.160]  power as they destroy their own future I did a little research and I'll get back
[18:11.160 --> 18:15.440]  to the cancer statistics I just want to point out that vaccines carry viruses
[18:15.440 --> 18:21.480]  that are known to cause cancer I'll say that again vaccines carry viruses that
[18:21.480 --> 18:25.680]  are known by the companies that make them and the US government and the
[18:25.680 --> 18:30.640]  World Health Organization to cause cancer and oh by the way hepatitis B
[18:30.640 --> 18:37.200]  vaccine spread HIV in the homosexual community that received it first now
[18:37.200 --> 18:41.320]  that was all declassified now now doctor give them that number again that that
[18:41.320 --> 18:45.720]  by that that people born after 2000 aren't gonna live as long as their
[18:45.720 --> 18:50.800]  parents exactly and so we're talking about for kids born in the year 2000
[18:50.800 --> 18:57.320]  and after one child in two by the time they reach their 18th birthday one
[18:57.320 --> 19:03.560]  child and two will either have died of cancer or have been treated for cancer
[19:03.560 --> 19:10.280]  and recovered so one half of the people born in the year 2000 and after are
[19:10.280 --> 19:15.520]  expected to either be victims or survivors of cancer doctor I've seen
[19:15.520 --> 19:19.440]  those mainline numbers I don't have them in front of me of the half that are
[19:19.440 --> 19:23.520]  gonna die or be sick what percentage is death what percentage will just be
[19:23.520 --> 19:30.120]  surviving it well it depends on whether you're you're lucky enough to avoid
[19:30.120 --> 19:35.080]  chemotherapy and radiation and find your way to somebody who treats you
[19:35.080 --> 19:39.680]  naturally or whether you're unfortunate enough to be talking about 25% of the
[19:39.680 --> 19:43.360]  people right now who were born after 2000 are gonna be dead I mean is it a
[19:43.360 --> 19:48.040]  half of that number well I would assume that it's more than half because okay
[19:48.040 --> 19:51.440]  there's a dirty little secret in Kansas statistic will stay there stay there I
[19:51.440 --> 19:57.440]  want to hear about it do you know the truth about cancer treatments do you
[19:57.440 --> 20:01.640]  realize that with all presently accepted methods you are not correctly
[20:01.640 --> 20:06.840]  attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment do
[20:06.840 --> 20:10.640]  you realize that mutilating surgery burning and the poisoning of your
[20:10.640 --> 20:17.480]  entire system are totally unnecessary but now it's cancers turn to die with

[24:07.520 --> 24:13.800]  Romans had trouble beating an enemy like Hannibal at Carthage they just kill
[24:13.800 --> 24:18.840]  everybody normally haul off the young women and children but kill everybody
[24:18.840 --> 24:24.320]  else burn everything down and then bring in expensive sea salt back then money
[24:24.320 --> 24:31.160]  and dump tons of it into the growing areas and that's what's happened the
[24:31.160 --> 24:34.280]  globalists say they over a hundred years ago they told their scientists they
[24:34.280 --> 24:39.520]  said we want to secure our power forever we know other empires get overthrown we
[24:39.520 --> 24:44.240]  believe in science how can you totally ensure that these elite families will
[24:44.240 --> 24:48.040]  own and run everything and they said the answer is done everybody down and then
[24:48.040 --> 24:52.600]  kill the majority of them and then engineer a subspecies to serve you you
[24:52.600 --> 24:57.640]  may have heard of that in the the Eloy and the Morlocks H.G. Wells he actually
[24:57.640 --> 25:00.920]  wrote nonfiction books about how they were really gonna do that to us and then
[25:00.920 --> 25:04.520]  all these other top eugenicists wrote about it the transhumanist and and by
[25:04.520 --> 25:06.880]  that the founders of a missing all transhumanists believe this but the
[25:06.880 --> 25:10.360]  founders did and they're in control they're carrying out huge black ops
[25:10.360 --> 25:15.000]  right now and a lot of cops are listening and laughing I'm so sad for
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.520]  your child when they die for God's sake just look into who killed your child
[25:19.520 --> 25:26.000]  now before they die because doctor please continue the statistics if right
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.560]  around half or more are gonna get cancer or die of cancer by 18 governments own
[25:31.560 --> 25:37.360]  numbers who were born for 2000 how many people listening right now whose children
[25:37.360 --> 25:41.440]  according to the current statistics and what we're projecting how many of them
[25:41.440 --> 25:46.520]  are gonna have a dead dead children during the prime of their lives
[25:46.520 --> 25:51.120]  well that's exactly right that's the question that has to be asked we're
[25:51.120 --> 25:58.440]  talking about programs we're talking about mythical benefits that that are
[25:58.440 --> 26:03.280]  ascribed to vaccination for instance I did some some calculations yesterday and
[26:03.280 --> 26:10.360]  by the time a person reaches 70 under the current advisory committee on
[26:10.360 --> 26:16.680]  immunization practices CDC schedule a person who is lucky enough to reach 70
[26:16.680 --> 26:23.440]  if fully immunized would have received 197 doses of deadly vaccines now what
[26:23.440 --> 26:27.480]  kind of craziness is that of course it's wildly profitable and more of these
[26:27.480 --> 26:31.880]  these horrors which cause cancer and other diseases well here's an example I
[26:31.880 --> 26:36.520]  know old folks I know old folks that that a doctor that exercise they had
[26:36.520 --> 26:39.560]  healthy parents before them but they get a couple flu shots and they're
[26:39.560 --> 26:43.200]  basically gone and I've seen the government's own mission that three flu
[26:43.200 --> 26:47.880]  shots doubles your chances of Alzheimer's go ahead precisely so we're talking
[26:47.880 --> 26:52.440]  about now a government schedule a government and force schedule and it's
[26:52.440 --> 26:57.600]  now law in New Jersey and will become law shortly in New York unless we win this
[26:57.600 --> 27:02.280]  battle and if you don't plan on winning this battle and you have children I
[27:02.280 --> 27:07.600]  advise you to move out of the United States it's about simple so we're
[27:07.600 --> 27:13.560]  talking about two flu shots in the first year of life according to the
[27:13.560 --> 27:18.640]  government schedule these flu shots 96% of the flu shots on the market
[27:18.640 --> 27:23.040]  contain mercury let's be clear about that they are mercury containing
[27:23.040 --> 27:28.440]  formaldehyde containing aluminum hydroxide containing aspartame
[27:28.440 --> 27:32.560]  containing monosodium glutamate contained and again doctor they will lie
[27:32.560 --> 27:37.000]  they will lie and tell you what's out of there go ahead exactly but what they
[27:37.000 --> 27:42.400]  mean is that they got it out of 4% yes the vaccine doses so these vaccines
[27:42.400 --> 27:48.440]  twice in the first year and once a year thereafter for the rest of your life
[27:48.440 --> 27:55.240]  but three vaccines of three flu shots increased by two-fold your chances of
[27:55.240 --> 27:59.480]  getting Alzheimer's my mother just died of Alzheimer's and although she was
[27:59.480 --> 28:05.600]  aware of the importance of nutrition and health she has submitted herself to
[28:05.600 --> 28:10.680]  flu shots she did everything the conventional doctors told her to because
[28:10.680 --> 28:17.240]  it was covered by Medicare and I'm sorry by yes by Medicare so we're talking
[28:17.240 --> 28:23.120]  about institutionalized propaganda lies which is no straight no news to your
[28:23.120 --> 28:26.960]  but I want to be clear it's mainstream back of the paper admitted you take
[28:26.960 --> 28:31.040]  three flu shots double your chance and I've seen other statistics if you take
[28:31.040 --> 28:35.840]  over 10 it's over you're going to get it it is a eating your brain that's
[28:35.840 --> 28:42.960]  exactly right now on one of your recent pages on your website you have the
[28:42.960 --> 28:51.360]  University of Calgary film showing how mercury literally eats the the neurons
[28:51.360 --> 28:56.640]  of those who don't know it is an electron microscope showing that of all the
[28:56.640 --> 29:02.040]  heavy metals it causes electrochemical chain reactions other heavy metals just
[29:02.040 --> 29:07.680]  plaque up and only kill what they touch but like the movie aliens mercury just
[29:07.680 --> 29:11.160]  keeps eating through the brain cells doctor let's talk about cancer
[29:11.160 --> 29:17.800]  statistics for a moment we all know the the rubric early detection means cure
[29:17.800 --> 29:21.960]  for instance for breast cancer and everybody has to understand that the
[29:21.960 --> 29:28.600]  October pink ribbon breast cancer month is a marketing ploy for mammograms and
[29:28.600 --> 29:34.800]  for deadly drugs like tamoxifen stay there doctor medical doctor Reema
[29:34.800 --> 29:39.120]  labo and we've got general stubble bind major general her husband about to

[33:08.320 --> 33:13.400]  doubles your chance of just one type of brain tumor the type that Kennedy now
[33:13.400 --> 33:19.320]  has on the exact side of the head he used the phone on the frequency pollution
[33:19.320 --> 33:25.760]  the GMO according to my research is the worst then the vaccines now they want
[33:25.760 --> 33:30.120]  to engineer it into fruits and vegetables quote to force the Africans
[33:30.120 --> 33:33.400]  that are ignorant in their words and refuse to take vaccines believing it's
[33:33.400 --> 33:38.400]  killing them they used to love the white medicine men that came in the doctors
[33:38.400 --> 33:43.080]  now they run in fear they have to pay off the local military and police to force
[33:43.080 --> 33:46.600]  it there's all these reports out of Thailand documented where they come and
[33:46.600 --> 33:50.560]  inject the pregnant women with tetanus and it kills the babies every
[33:50.560 --> 33:56.440]  time I mean we're under mass murder attack everywhere and we're talking to
[33:56.440 --> 34:01.240]  Dr. Reema Lebo she was on with this yesterday General Stubblebind's wife
[34:01.240 --> 34:05.480]  she's a medical doctor General Stubblebind major general is gonna pop in
[34:05.480 --> 34:09.640]  in just a moment with his his analysis from the former head of Army
[34:09.640 --> 34:13.120]  Intelligence about compartmentalization how they're keeping this project secret
[34:13.120 --> 34:16.800]  from nurses and doctors and others and what he thinks we should do also they're
[34:16.800 --> 34:19.640]  going to plug their website I'm just really impressed with their analysis
[34:19.640 --> 34:24.520]  it's dead on with the same info I've got but she's a medical doctor he's the
[34:24.520 --> 34:31.480]  former head of intelligence bottom line you're just covering the vaccines alone
[34:31.480 --> 34:36.400]  that we know every major vaccine has all these different cancer viruses known
[34:36.400 --> 34:44.680]  viruses that cause cancer it's just it's just a rain of terror and I mean
[34:44.680 --> 34:49.920]  everybody I know it's got teenagers dying college kids dying babies dying of
[34:49.920 --> 35:03.520]  cancer and Dr. Lebo again half the people out there who were born after 2000
[35:03.520 --> 35:07.720]  government's own numbers are gonna die or almost die from cancer by the age of
[35:07.720 --> 35:12.760]  18 this is this is a holocaust and see it's not just happening in Africa where
[35:12.760 --> 35:16.960]  40 plus million have died from engineered chemical and bio weapons put
[35:16.960 --> 35:21.960]  into their biosphere they're doing it to us here and it's all about how to
[35:21.960 --> 35:28.400]  compartmentalize it isn't it absolutely it's not just cancer when when we think
[35:28.400 --> 35:34.760]  of alfamers we think of older people well we're seeing teenagers with alfamers
[35:34.760 --> 35:38.200]  from the toxins in their food from the aluminum that they're drinking in their
[35:38.200 --> 35:43.160]  their cans exactly now they're saying 25 30 year olds are getting quote early
[35:43.160 --> 35:46.840]  on set we're all gonna have it now it's normal you were talking about breast
[35:46.840 --> 35:51.240]  cancer I was talking about breast cancer and I was saying that it used to be the
[35:51.240 --> 35:55.920]  survival from breast cancer was defined as five years without recurrence that's
[35:55.920 --> 36:02.280]  not exactly survival and it used to be that prevention meant actually avoiding
[36:02.280 --> 36:07.320]  cancer well now prevention has been morphed into early detection which means
[36:07.320 --> 36:12.640]  getting a mammogram which means exposing your exposing yourself to a six-fold
[36:12.640 --> 36:17.040]  increase in your risk of getting breast cancer remember breast cancer and other
[36:17.040 --> 36:22.760]  cancers are highly profitable so we're talking about propaganda to get women to
[36:22.760 --> 36:28.480]  expose themselves to a cancer-causing procedure called mammography so that
[36:28.480 --> 36:34.840]  then they can take tamoxifen and other cancer-causing drugs at huge expense
[36:34.840 --> 36:41.240]  such as a thousand dollars a month per woman for her entire life that's the
[36:41.240 --> 36:46.000]  plan now doctor I saw a number last year from the CDC that there had been a
[36:46.000 --> 36:53.280]  seven-fold increase in lung cancer and even though people have stopped smoking
[36:53.280 --> 36:58.080]  as much and they said no it's women that don't smoke and then I found all these
[36:58.080 --> 37:02.040]  classes of viruses they've quote found that have contaminated but contaminated
[37:02.040 --> 37:06.080]  means it's an accident and some of course cancers attack some viruses attack
[37:06.080 --> 37:10.800]  women more than men some men more than women why are we having a seven-fold
[37:10.800 --> 37:15.720]  increase in early onset of lung cancer in women well most people breathe Alex
[37:15.720 --> 37:21.840]  and when they are exposed to chem trail pollutants such as fiberglass coated
[37:21.840 --> 37:25.720]  with aluminum beryllium viruses mycoplasma
[37:25.720 --> 37:34.000]  desiccated blood cells red blood cells aluminum and so on and these things get
[37:34.000 --> 37:39.640]  into their lungs or they're unlucky enough to live in the San Francisco Bay
[37:39.640 --> 37:47.200]  area of California where a nanoparticle urea nitrate plastics are sprayed into
[37:47.200 --> 37:52.000]  the air when and that by the way we believe is a bellwether for what's
[37:52.000 --> 37:55.920]  going to happen to the rest of the country in California it's said to
[37:55.920 --> 38:00.280]  control the mythical light brown apple moth which is not a pest and hasn't even
[38:00.280 --> 38:06.520]  been definitely shown to infest the area and it doesn't do any harm anyway
[38:06.520 --> 38:12.720]  we're talking about spraying things that are bound to cause lung cancer as my
[38:12.720 --> 38:17.680]  heart disease etc etc exactly and it's also a payoff to the chemical companies
[38:17.680 --> 38:20.960]  while they do it they claim there was some moth here in Austin one night I
[38:20.960 --> 38:25.680]  got home at 2 a.m. and the system flies right over my house it is spraying the
[38:25.680 --> 38:30.000]  neighborhood at 300 feet I went and googled it and sure enough it said oh
[38:30.000 --> 38:33.280]  overnight for the next month they'll be spraying all of Austin then I went and
[38:33.280 --> 38:36.040]  looked up the chemical they admitted they were spraying it's totally deadly
[38:36.040 --> 38:40.360]  but but expanding on that I want to go to General Stubblebine here doctor
[38:40.360 --> 38:46.120]  label but getting into the mindset what do you I mean the black ops that are
[38:46.120 --> 38:49.960]  doing this this huge eugenics program which they admit they're carrying out
[38:49.960 --> 38:54.600]  but the details are secret and that they're funding I mean these monsters
[38:54.600 --> 38:59.080]  doing this killing and I guess they think they're saving the earth by
[38:59.080 --> 39:11.000]  killing us hello yes general I I I wanted to get your take since she's
[39:11.000 --> 39:14.120]  having the phone to you and you're down in Panama right now you know it's the
[39:14.120 --> 39:17.280]  former head of army intelligence is the former head of special operations is
[39:17.280 --> 39:21.440]  the former head of special forces I mean understanding compartmentalization
[39:21.440 --> 39:26.040]  knowing this is a war they're carrying out against this a how do you think they're
[39:26.040 --> 39:29.200]  compartmentalizing it where what sectors do you think you're carrying this out
[39:29.200 --> 39:36.160]  and then be how do we counter this this military globalist attack on us yeah
[39:36.160 --> 39:44.720]  well let me let let me go back to the compartmentalization you know in the in
[39:44.720 --> 39:53.960]  the when I was on in the service each one of the classified programs had a had
[39:53.960 --> 40:00.840]  literally a fence around it and each one of these fences you couldn't get in
[40:00.840 --> 40:10.920]  unless you were authorized okay so there was a secret set that you were not
[40:10.920 --> 40:17.520]  allowed in unless you had a need to know okay now take a look at the at the
[40:17.520 --> 40:22.800]  world that we're living in now the civilian world you can't put a secret
[40:22.800 --> 40:29.040]  the fence around these things so these things are hidden in plain sight and if
[40:29.040 --> 40:37.200]  you go to our website www.healthfreedomusa.org you'll see on there a
[40:37.200 --> 40:44.960]  recent paper that we've done called connecting the deadly dots okay these
[40:44.960 --> 40:48.960]  things are hidden in plain sight and you got to go to the website and take a
[40:48.960 --> 40:54.320]  look at that I and I understand you got it up on your website too but you need
[40:54.320 --> 40:58.560]  to look at the deadly dots for instance let me just give you a couple of
[40:58.560 --> 41:04.160]  examples you've got GMOs the GMOs are untested they're unsafe they're
[41:04.160 --> 41:11.040]  unfriendly to nature okay where do they lead it's absolutely forbidden it's
[41:11.040 --> 41:16.800]  against the law in the United States to label a GMO why why don't they label a
[41:16.800 --> 41:21.720]  GMO because they don't want you to know what the hell is in that thing okay what
[41:21.720 --> 41:25.800]  you do know is they've never been tested they've never been proven to be safe and
[41:25.800 --> 41:30.360]  yet they're unlabeled and in your in your food then take a look at the drugs
[41:30.360 --> 41:43.640]  the drugs are first thing that the drugs do is poison the enzyme system so you
[41:43.640 --> 41:47.200]  take a drug and what you're doing with that drug is you're poisoning your own
[41:47.200 --> 41:52.520]  enzyme system so why would you take a drug something that's gonna poison you
[41:52.520 --> 41:57.640]  well that's that's what they advertise they're good for you no they're not
[41:57.640 --> 42:01.520]  they're poisoning your enzyme systems and besides all of which you don't need
[42:01.520 --> 42:05.920]  to do it all you got to do is make sure that your immune system is in good
[42:05.920 --> 42:11.760]  shape vitamin C does that I got cancer I had prostate cancer I didn't take any
[42:11.760 --> 42:22.160]  drugs I didn't take any chemotherapy okay zero okay and as a matter of fact my
[42:22.160 --> 42:30.720]  wife Rima provided the cure for me which was largely vitamin C and minerals and
[42:30.720 --> 42:38.560]  vitamins that my body needed to get my immune system back in order that that's
[42:38.560 --> 42:46.160]  the way it should be done not chemotherapy okay now go to a vaccine
[42:46.160 --> 42:51.200]  we've already talked about the vaccine what we haven't talked about is the
[42:51.200 --> 42:56.760]  Gulf War syndrome you know all of the soldiers going into the Gulf War had to
[42:56.760 --> 43:01.120]  have a shot they had to have their shots and then they came back and they had
[43:01.120 --> 43:04.920]  Gulf War syndrome and everybody in the government said no no no it's all in your
[43:04.920 --> 43:11.320]  mind no no no it's you it's not us well it turns out that the thing that was
[43:11.320 --> 43:15.720]  causing it was quailing that was in the vaccines that they got what is quailing
[43:15.720 --> 43:20.840]  do it turns on your immune system the problem is it never turns off so it
[43:20.840 --> 43:25.840]  wears out and finally your your immune system collapses and you're dead or
[43:25.840 --> 43:30.120]  you're deeply well it wasn't just that it was the anthrax shots and all the
[43:30.120 --> 43:33.680]  rest of it they admitted later quote were contaminated with hundreds of
[43:33.680 --> 43:39.920]  bacteria viruses funguses from that plant up at bio port in Michigan that's
[43:39.920 --> 43:45.440]  right but when did they finally admit it long long after and after what some
[43:45.440 --> 43:52.200]  hundred seven hundred thousand of them were were infected well doctor I'm out
[43:52.200 --> 43:59.400]  but every modern vaccine contains quailing every one and they tell you
[43:59.400 --> 44:03.640]  it's no big deal and you know good for you but the some of the studies show
[44:03.640 --> 44:06.480]  different but I would say and I'm not a medical doctor just the studies that
[44:06.480 --> 44:11.320]  compared to some of the viruses and things it's it's it's it's tame but
[44:11.320 --> 44:15.600]  expanding on this general from a military perspective running army
[44:15.600 --> 44:19.600]  intelligence running special forces running research all the posts you've
[44:19.600 --> 44:24.200]  had your major general this enemy profile this enemy attack profile because
[44:24.200 --> 44:27.480]  you know intelligence you know real operations are secret but their
[44:27.480 --> 44:31.280]  manifestation on the ground is not and you're right this is all in plain view
[44:31.280 --> 44:37.040]  and it's totally hidden in plain view so so so analyzing that sir how many
[44:37.040 --> 44:40.840]  people do you think really know what they're doing how big is this attack
[44:40.840 --> 44:45.120]  profile I mean we're gonna be killing half the people born after 2000 or
[44:45.120 --> 44:48.120]  close to it I mean this is gonna get more and more obvious like it is in
[44:48.120 --> 44:53.600]  Africa I mean talking about who these people are talking about how we expose
[44:53.600 --> 44:57.160]  them how we educate the public I mean you understand I mean let's talk about
[44:57.160 --> 45:03.160]  the enemy who they are well let me let me answer that let me let me continue
[45:03.160 --> 45:07.360]  with the thought process about the connecting the dots because you got
[45:07.360 --> 45:12.520]  GMOs you got poisonous food you've got the food baiting the meats in in in
[45:12.520 --> 45:17.520]  in viruses you got the drugs that we've just talked about you've got codex
[45:17.520 --> 45:25.040]  which allows the they've allowed the worst pesticides back into the system
[45:25.040 --> 45:29.400]  they're banned by the entire world and now they've allowed them back into the
[45:29.400 --> 45:34.640]  system at with no upper limits on the amount of pesticides that they can put
[45:34.640 --> 45:43.520]  in they keep they're still struggling over the GMOs they they've right now
[45:43.520 --> 45:48.640]  they're permitted but Europe is fighting it Africa is fighting it and but then
[45:48.640 --> 45:52.320]  you've got the chemtrails we've talked about those you've got the cancer which
[45:52.320 --> 45:56.080]  we've talked about we've talked about the spraying you've talked about the
[45:56.080 --> 46:02.200]  vaccine you put all of these together where do they point they point to the
[46:02.200 --> 46:07.520]  population and oh by the way we haven't even talked about war the war that we
[46:07.520 --> 46:12.600]  couldn't wait to get into you know war should be the last choice not the first
[46:12.600 --> 46:17.200]  choice and what are we doing we're killing people right and left with the
[46:17.200 --> 46:21.520]  war is that depopulation you better believe State Department memorandum
[46:21.520 --> 46:26.680]  200 says engineered famines engineered wars conservatively we've got more than
[46:26.680 --> 46:32.560]  two million dead Iraqis in the last 18 years of total siege we've got the troops
[46:32.560 --> 46:36.440]  coming back sick by the hundreds of thousands dying I mean this is mass
[46:36.440 --> 46:43.040]  carnage you got it and you you again you got to go to the WWW health freedom
[46:43.040 --> 46:50.560]  USA dot org and take a look at the how we've connected these dots I and again
[46:50.560 --> 46:56.920]  I want to remind people that I think it's on your site to sign up for the
[46:56.920 --> 47:02.880]  health freedom alerts take the action steps because let me tell you Alex the
[47:02.880 --> 47:09.400]  key to all of this the key to survival is called truth now I agree with you and
[47:09.400 --> 47:13.000]  we need to lose we need to you know truly organic food we need to stay away
[47:13.000 --> 47:16.000]  from this we need to get out of major cities with their concentrating a lot
[47:16.000 --> 47:18.880]  of their spraying but and they're poisoning the major water supplies
[47:18.880 --> 47:24.120]  filter the water that's number one but listen sir I really want your analysis
[47:24.120 --> 47:29.720]  on this enemy because obviously exposing them is the key waking up the cops and
[47:29.720 --> 47:34.080]  military the enforcers of this who who are compartmentalized I mean this is
[47:34.080 --> 47:37.800]  affecting them we're all in this together and I think it's clear to
[47:37.800 --> 47:43.360]  explain to people in government that 99.8% of government isn't aware of this
[47:43.360 --> 47:47.640]  eugenics operation we've brought a lot of globalists on and I'll talk to them
[47:47.640 --> 47:51.200]  during the break and they'll get really mad when they hear me talk about in game
[47:51.200 --> 47:54.400]  and they're like oh my god you know about this so they're really getting
[47:54.400 --> 47:59.160]  scared that we've cracked their attack profile Africa knows all we got all these
[47:59.160 --> 48:02.520]  Nobel Prize winners coming out saying what you're saying I mean I see a real
[48:02.520 --> 48:06.920]  clash happening general as the real intelligentsia who isn't part of this
[48:06.920 --> 48:17.440]  mass murder eugenics op realizes what's happening well in 2002 and 2003 we had
[48:17.440 --> 48:28.680]  in our medical practice ahead of state and this individual claimed that she
[48:28.680 --> 48:37.680]  knew about a lot of this and all of us all of us were called useless eaters she
[48:37.680 --> 48:43.600]  told us as useless eaters you didn't belong on this planet she told us that
[48:43.600 --> 48:48.600]  that was how she had been raised and that the time was coming when those of us
[48:48.600 --> 48:53.600]  who were useless eaters that's 90% of the world's population would be
[48:53.600 --> 49:01.760]  eliminated because according to her we were using up the non-renewable resources
[49:01.760 --> 49:08.040]  that belonged to the master group by the way that is a Adolf Hitler comment
[49:08.040 --> 49:11.760]  useless eaters he got it from Lord Milner that ran the big British Royal
[49:11.760 --> 49:18.320]  Roundtable grips that is our CFR but Ted Turner said that at a press dinner in
[49:18.320 --> 49:25.760]  96 and she actually goes back to 1922 when two German professors proposed
[49:25.760 --> 49:30.680]  killing useless eaters people who have lives not worth living who did not
[49:30.680 --> 49:34.920]  contribute to the state or were in any way defective now I want to explain to
[49:34.920 --> 49:38.480]  the cops I want to explain everybody they're killing you now when you're
[49:38.480 --> 49:42.880]  dying at least tell your family we were right I know you won't listen now but
[49:42.880 --> 49:47.520]  when the enemy kills you and as you're trying to suck breaths okay and as
[49:47.520 --> 49:50.480]  you're getting ready to death rattle at least tell them fight the new world
[49:50.480 --> 49:54.800]  order at least for other people and you know general a lot of them aren't gonna
[49:54.800 --> 50:00.800]  listen are they no as a matter of fact it took me a while to wake up and but
[50:00.800 --> 50:06.320]  suddenly your your the cover was taken off the eyes and you began to take a
[50:06.320 --> 50:11.600]  look and you began to analyze and you began to get draw in more information
[50:11.600 --> 50:16.400]  and the more and more information that you draw in you suddenly make the create
[50:16.400 --> 50:22.200]  the picture which is exactly why we did the connecting the deadly dot yes and
[50:22.200 --> 50:27.400]  we've got that up on info wars go to the health freedom USA dot org sign up for
[50:27.400 --> 50:32.880]  the alert general and final final you take action and you guys are going at
[50:32.880 --> 50:36.960]  the end of the month the idly to the codex alimentarius you're gonna be
[50:36.960 --> 50:40.720]  reporting for us live from there we really appreciate you listen to me
[50:40.720 --> 50:44.720]  everyone listening there's no more time to deny they're coming with forced
[50:44.720 --> 50:49.480]  injections they admit it caused all the autism their murderers will be right

[1:01:24.640 --> 1:01:31.600]  people and soon I mean it's so hellish what did you say to her finish the
[1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:40.520]  codex story to finish the codex story the the Nigerian delegate organized
[1:01:40.520 --> 1:01:46.000]  this picnic and we sat across the the road from the main building with the
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:52.320]  auditorium and did meet with the delegates so what happens is as long as
[1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:56.840]  you're telling the truth and you have actions and a ways of solving problems
[1:01:56.840 --> 1:02:01.640]  people will come to you and people will take the action that you suggest but
[1:02:01.640 --> 1:02:05.520]  well I mean they got tens of millions down in Nigeria from the bio attack I
[1:02:05.520 --> 1:02:09.560]  mean they're listening sure that's right I want to I want to point out tens of
[1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:13.920]  millions indeed we don't need tens of millions of codex is a winnable battle if
[1:02:13.920 --> 1:02:18.320]  we have the resources to make the visit to these countries and provide them with
[1:02:18.320 --> 1:02:22.400]  the technical support that they're asking for we can turn codex into the
[1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:27.200]  most powerful pro-health organization that's ever existed on the face take it
[1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:30.920]  over absolutely I'm gonna have you back on about that more about this head of
[1:02:30.920 --> 1:02:37.320]  state okay what happened was that this lady and know it was not the Queen of
[1:02:37.320 --> 1:02:41.920]  England everybody always ask that but I can't tell you who it was because although
[1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:45.720]  the government of the United States doesn't believe that we have the right
[1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:51.400]  to medical privacy I still believe that was it Merkel go ahead I can't tell you
[1:02:51.400 --> 1:02:56.560]  who it was because that would violate her head though go ahead so she came to
[1:02:56.560 --> 1:03:02.920]  us with a serious medical problem which she no longer has and she knew she was
[1:03:02.920 --> 1:03:07.800]  a nice chatty sort of lady and she news about the fact that she had been raised
[1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:13.640]  first of all she had been raised in what we would call satanic programming
[1:03:13.640 --> 1:03:20.000]  systems and second of all she had been raised to believe that 90% of the
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:26.400]  world's population is indeed useless eaters who are concerned consuming the
[1:03:26.400 --> 1:03:32.840]  non-renewable resources of the the rulers of the world that is her class and
[1:03:32.840 --> 1:03:39.560]  that 90% of us were therefore appropriately slated for extinction but
[1:03:39.560 --> 1:03:44.120]  she was a sort of the nice lady and she said you know I'm not so sure that
[1:03:44.120 --> 1:03:49.120]  that's really right but that's really the way it should be so she actually had
[1:03:49.120 --> 1:03:54.640]  doubts I found that quite extraordinary she was actually entertaining the idea
[1:03:54.640 --> 1:03:59.680]  that maybe genocide wasn't nice well I want to tell her and others in closing
[1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:03.480]  that the in this enemy we know this are the Soviets the Nazis others they're
[1:04:03.480 --> 1:04:07.960]  gonna kill each other to this this this instinct to murder and kill for total
[1:04:07.960 --> 1:04:13.040]  psycho dominance doesn't stop does it general it the general is not on the
[1:04:13.040 --> 1:04:16.360]  phone because we only have one hand set between us understand I know you're in
[1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:22.160]  Panama but I also want to say that my worst nightmare the one that has kept me
[1:04:22.160 --> 1:04:26.920]  up at night is suppose these people are so crazy that they believe they can
[1:04:26.920 --> 1:04:31.120]  just spoil the earth totally and then put it back together with technology so
[1:04:31.120 --> 1:04:37.360]  when I heard the name of the empty mountain in Svalbard and now holding the
[1:04:37.360 --> 1:04:42.400]  seeds the natural seeds that are being replaced there and caught that it's
[1:04:42.400 --> 1:04:46.440]  called the doomsday vault this is too powerful if you can stay three minutes
[1:04:46.440 --> 1:04:50.720]  five more minutes on the other side it's too powerful I gotta hear this the
[1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:54.200]  ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or
[1:04:54.200 --> 1:04:57.840]  conservatism but globalism globalists are concerned with what's good for the
[1:04:57.840 --> 1:05:01.520]  American Empire instead of what's fair for the American people the only
[1:05:01.520 --> 1:05:05.200]  antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism which is why you should be

[1:16:06.640 --> 1:16:09.880]  actually going to be using a lot of Mike's research in my upcoming film
[1:16:09.880 --> 1:16:14.360]  fabled enemies in my Israeli section on 9-11 I feel like there's been a lot of
[1:16:14.360 --> 1:16:18.520]  9-11 documentaries out there but there hasn't been one that really shows the
[1:16:18.520 --> 1:16:21.600]  roles of each of the countries and agencies involved and that's what I'm
[1:16:21.600 --> 1:16:25.080]  trying to do with this new one Michael are you with us I'm definitely with you
[1:16:25.080 --> 1:16:28.720]  Aloha well thanks for having me on the show well I'm pleased to have you on
[1:16:28.720 --> 1:16:33.480]  Mike so so what's new and what really happened at com right now well a lot of
[1:16:33.480 --> 1:16:37.640]  interesting stuff going on obviously we're following the primaries today
[1:16:37.640 --> 1:16:41.160]  we're seeing the seesaw report back and forth about Hillary will concede
[1:16:41.160 --> 1:16:45.040]  tonight no she won't yes she will no she won't yes she will we're continuing to
[1:16:45.040 --> 1:16:49.480]  see rumors and I stress at this point that's all they are that there is some
[1:16:49.480 --> 1:16:56.160]  kind of a bombshell coming regarding Michelle Obama which will fuel Hillary
[1:16:56.160 --> 1:17:01.400]  to take the fight for the nomination right into the convention and attempt to
[1:17:01.400 --> 1:17:05.880]  continue to persuade the Democrats that she and she alone can defeat McCain and
[1:17:05.880 --> 1:17:10.880]  that Obama as the nominee is a guarantee of a GOP White House next year
[1:17:10.880 --> 1:17:15.560]  obviously this is one of the hardest fought prime nomination campaigns we've
[1:17:15.560 --> 1:17:20.640]  seen in a great many years I think we're seeing the beginning of a concerted
[1:17:20.640 --> 1:17:24.760]  effort among the Democratic leadership to basically bring this thing to a close
[1:17:24.760 --> 1:17:31.000]  before damages the Democratic Party as a whole I do know that we're continuing to
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:35.840]  get word that at least 25 more super delegates will commit to Obama in the
[1:17:35.840 --> 1:17:39.960]  next couple of days and so I think the Democratic leadership as a whole
[1:17:39.960 --> 1:17:44.200]  basically wants this to come to an end because a floor fight at the convention
[1:17:44.200 --> 1:17:49.240]  is really going to do more harm than good and will definitely ease the way for
[1:17:49.240 --> 1:17:52.560]  McCain to be the next president well maybe it's just me but I don't see the
[1:17:52.560 --> 1:17:56.200]  Clintons giving up anytime soon I mean Hillary has drawn this out as far as she
[1:17:56.200 --> 1:18:00.000]  possibly can and a lot of people said to me you know three four months ago she
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:02.920]  was about to drop out she had no chance Obama was definitely going to be the
[1:18:02.920 --> 1:18:08.080]  nominee but here we are all the way in June and she still is not conceded we
[1:18:08.080 --> 1:18:11.560]  know the Bilderberg conference is coming up this week I have a sneaking
[1:18:11.560 --> 1:18:16.480]  suspicion that of course the Democratic presidential candidate is going to be
[1:18:16.480 --> 1:18:20.200]  discussed but I really feel like they're also going to be choosing a VP candidate
[1:18:20.200 --> 1:18:23.960]  I've always said that if we don't get this Hillary Obama ticket or Obama
[1:18:23.960 --> 1:18:27.240]  Hillary ticket Edwards will be the second guy what do you think who do you
[1:18:27.240 --> 1:18:32.600]  think they're gonna nominee for vice president well I think that and first of
[1:18:32.600 --> 1:18:36.240]  all I agree that the Clintons are not ones to give up they're not even ones to
[1:18:36.240 --> 1:18:39.840]  play by the rules and I don't think we've seen the last of Hillary anytime soon
[1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:45.520]  now I don't think Obama will have Hillary as a vice presidential consideration
[1:18:45.520 --> 1:18:49.600]  simply because of all the time she's joked about somebody shooting him and
[1:18:49.600 --> 1:18:53.900]  it's obviously an obsession with her and we all remember how George Bush
[1:18:53.900 --> 1:18:57.680]  senior almost got an early promotion to the center seat courtesy of their
[1:18:57.680 --> 1:19:01.680]  family friends the Hinckley's so I think Obama would be very very stupid to have
[1:19:01.680 --> 1:19:06.560]  Hillary as his vice presidential running mate and as far as who he's gonna tap I
[1:19:06.560 --> 1:19:11.800]  agree Edwards is a likely possibility again that may get decided on the
[1:19:11.800 --> 1:19:15.680]  convention floor Hillary may go in there and try and force her way into the
[1:19:15.680 --> 1:19:20.840]  number two slot you know we'll see uh... he again it isn't over till the fat
[1:19:20.840 --> 1:19:26.160]  lady things and uh... you know this this is defying a lot of predictions by a lot
[1:19:26.160 --> 1:19:29.720]  of people so i think the best that we can say is that we don't really know
[1:19:29.720 --> 1:19:33.960]  until it's really all over well I agree with you there and I I can see you know
[1:19:33.960 --> 1:19:37.400]  Clinton becoming the vice presidential nomination not because Obama wants her
[1:19:37.400 --> 1:19:41.320]  but because the powers that we do just like George HW Bush for Reagan we're
[1:19:41.320 --> 1:19:48.320]  gonna be back after this this is the Alex Jones show
[1:19:50.720 --> 1:19:54.440]  our beloved republic is on her knees the forces of globalism are destroying
[1:19:54.440 --> 1:19:58.760]  national sovereignty worldwide but in liberties darkest hour there is hope
[1:19:58.760 --> 1:20:01.960]  the first time in modern history the people are beginning to wake up it is
[1:20:01.960 --> 1:20:05.200]  essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's
[1:20:05.200 --> 1:20:08.800]  understanding of the new world order master plan we have a short time frame

[1:24:32.360 --> 1:24:50.200]  man still work still work best of the free life all right we are back it is
[1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:54.360]  the Alex Jones show on Jason Burma some sitting in for Alex as he goes off to the
[1:24:54.360 --> 1:24:58.360]  Bilderberg conference we're gonna be having spot checks throughout the rest of
[1:24:58.360 --> 1:25:01.320]  the week it should be very exciting times right now I'm speaking with Michael
[1:25:01.320 --> 1:25:05.800]  Rivera of what really happened dot com he also has a show here on the GCN
[1:25:05.800 --> 1:25:09.320]  networks I believe it's on the weekends in the morning and we're discussing who's
[1:25:09.320 --> 1:25:13.920]  going to be the president who's gonna get the VP nomination and I just mentioned
[1:25:13.920 --> 1:25:18.360]  that I I still think Hillary's got a shot at the VP nomination not so much
[1:25:18.360 --> 1:25:22.080]  because Obama would want her to have a shot of it but because the powers that
[1:25:22.080 --> 1:25:26.320]  be often decide without the other person's consent on Reagan was very
[1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:30.680]  opposed to have George HW Bush as his running mate really got coaxed in the
[1:25:30.680 --> 1:25:35.080]  matter and then was shot on the same day of a presidential succession drill not
[1:25:35.080 --> 1:25:40.440]  long after that so these people are unscrupulous and will do just about
[1:25:40.440 --> 1:25:43.360]  anything so I don't put anything past them especially the Clintons and Mina
[1:25:43.360 --> 1:25:48.240]  Arkansas and all that good stuff Mike yeah absolutely you know we do have a
[1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:52.360]  long history of political assassination in this country unfortunately we are
[1:25:52.360 --> 1:25:57.160]  beginning to see the general public become aware that this is a reality
[1:25:57.160 --> 1:26:01.600]  evidence surface of course recently that Robert Kennedy was in fact the victim
[1:26:01.600 --> 1:26:05.400]  of an assassination conspiracy there was more than one shooter there most people
[1:26:05.400 --> 1:26:10.480]  now know that the Warren Commission was lying about John F. Kennedy questions
[1:26:10.480 --> 1:26:14.720]  still remain about John F. Kennedy Jr. and how he conveniently crashed just in
[1:26:14.720 --> 1:26:18.680]  time to clear that Senate seat of any obstruction that Hillary is now fitting
[1:26:18.680 --> 1:26:22.080]  in so there's a very dark part of our history and this is one of the reasons
[1:26:22.080 --> 1:26:27.560]  why a lot of people are very concerned over Hillary's comments about a potential
[1:26:27.560 --> 1:26:32.640]  assassination of Obama being the reason for her to stay in the race and if she
[1:26:32.640 --> 1:26:36.880]  said it just once we'd put it up to bad taste but you know if there was three
[1:26:36.880 --> 1:26:39.840]  different incidents where she made this comment and so a lot of people think this
[1:26:39.840 --> 1:26:45.600]  is obviously something that is very much on her mind and you know even even now
[1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:48.520]  between now and the convention if something unfortunate were to happen
[1:26:48.520 --> 1:26:54.960]  to Barack Obama should obviously be the second you know the second pick to walk
[1:26:54.960 --> 1:27:00.360]  into the nomination say here I am guys and I'm still breathing so again I hate
[1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:05.000]  to be that cynical about it but again as you say going back to the error to the
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:09.720]  Arkansas history the Arkana side Vincent Foster which is of course where my own
[1:27:09.720 --> 1:27:14.000]  personal interaction with the Clintons began you know there is nothing that is
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:19.440]  really too extreme to consider that might happen absolutely and the thing is
[1:27:19.440 --> 1:27:22.840]  that with Obama and Hillary really have to first in this country they're gonna
[1:27:22.840 --> 1:27:27.200]  have the first woman president or the first black man be president and if
[1:27:27.200 --> 1:27:31.680]  Obama were to get to the nomination and say an assassination did happen it would
[1:27:31.680 --> 1:27:36.400]  be very easy for them to frame up a racist or a racist group and it would
[1:27:36.400 --> 1:27:39.280]  be very believable in this country if this were to occur somewhere in the
[1:27:39.280 --> 1:27:42.560]  south and I think the American public would buy into it and that's the real
[1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:47.280]  unfortunate thing Mike yeah absolutely you know there'd have to be a patsy but
[1:27:47.280 --> 1:27:51.360]  you know with the war machine pointing the way it is I see them trying to find
[1:27:51.360 --> 1:27:56.240]  some way that they would try and pin it on Iran or some other situation it's a
[1:27:56.240 --> 1:27:59.600]  bit of a reach but you know these people they get so arrogant because they've
[1:27:59.600 --> 1:28:03.920]  gotten away with it for so long and in a way that is almost their downfall
[1:28:03.920 --> 1:28:08.080]  because they're continuing to play these games by the rules that used to work in
[1:28:08.080 --> 1:28:12.960]  the 50s and 60s and 70s and they don't understand that the public has really
[1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:16.200]  changed because of alternative media because of Alex Jones because of the
[1:28:16.200 --> 1:28:20.560]  blogosphere we're more aware of it and and some of us are scratching our heads
[1:28:20.560 --> 1:28:25.040]  and saying they're using the same lies on Iran that they used on Iraq don't they
[1:28:25.040 --> 1:28:30.200]  understand we see through that now and I think the answer is no they don't they
[1:28:30.200 --> 1:28:33.640]  really think it's still working well I think that they have a big wake-up call
[1:28:33.640 --> 1:28:37.520]  when Scott McClellan the former White House press secretary writes a book
[1:28:37.520 --> 1:28:40.520]  that is very scathing of the administration I mean it's softball
[1:28:40.520 --> 1:28:44.800]  compared to what you and I discuss or Alex Jones discuss discusses but he
[1:28:44.800 --> 1:28:48.560]  openly says you know they they wanted this war with Iraq they fabricated
[1:28:48.560 --> 1:28:52.880]  evidence I lied for them on many occasions and what does he get for it
[1:28:52.880 --> 1:28:56.080]  for coming out and you know telling a little bit of the truth he gets scathed
[1:28:56.080 --> 1:29:00.320]  on Bill O'Reilly you know Bill O'Reilly gives the line all these people had the
[1:29:00.320 --> 1:29:04.440]  same intelligence and me and you know Mike we know that you know Hillary Clinton
[1:29:04.440 --> 1:29:09.240]  is playing on the same side as George Bush but you know O'Reilly sits there
[1:29:09.240 --> 1:29:12.640]  and screams you know it is false left right paradigm to his audience on Fox
[1:29:12.640 --> 1:29:17.040]  News and people buy into it on the websites what really happened calm it's
[1:29:17.040 --> 1:29:42.560]  the Alex Jones show and we'll be back right after this we're on the March the

[1:33:24.600 --> 1:33:27.360]  build a bird with the crew it should be an exciting time we're gonna have
[1:33:27.360 --> 1:33:31.560]  reports for the rest of the week I am Jason Bermas and right now we're talking
[1:33:31.560 --> 1:33:34.960]  to Michael Rivera Michael I just discussed a little bit McClellan coming
[1:33:34.960 --> 1:33:38.680]  out with his new book doing a couple interviews being ridiculed by the
[1:33:38.680 --> 1:33:43.800]  mainstream right if you will what's your take on the McClellan situation well
[1:33:43.800 --> 1:33:48.000]  as you were mentioning before McClellan has not taught told us anything we did
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:52.440]  not already know with the possible exception that it was Bush and Cheney
[1:33:52.440 --> 1:33:56.000]  who leaked Valerie Plain's name but for those of us who've been paying attention
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:00.280]  all along McClellan's book was a vindication and a validation that we
[1:34:00.280 --> 1:34:04.500]  had been correct all along we were lied into this war in Iraq as for the
[1:34:04.500 --> 1:34:08.280]  treatment that he is being given I'm sure he fully expected it it's certainly
[1:34:08.280 --> 1:34:11.680]  driving up sales of his book right now but I mean look at the treatment that
[1:34:11.680 --> 1:34:17.560]  former president Jimmy Carter was given for his book piece not apartheid for his
[1:34:17.560 --> 1:34:21.800]  recent admission that Israel does have at least 150 nuclear warheads
[1:34:21.800 --> 1:34:25.800]  this is a former president of the united states and yet the u.s. media
[1:34:25.800 --> 1:34:31.960]  just excoriated him on behalf of Israel and it is rather shameless that uh...
[1:34:31.960 --> 1:34:36.120]  the the mainstream media just feels that anybody who challenges the orthodox
[1:34:36.120 --> 1:34:42.120]  account of israel helplessness or in any way challenges the their public image
[1:34:42.120 --> 1:34:46.320]  uh... they're just going to get pounded on now as far as McClellan is concerned
[1:34:46.320 --> 1:34:50.280]  uh... he has undermined not only the justification for the war in iraq
[1:34:50.280 --> 1:34:54.520]  but he has pulled the legs out of the rush toward war in iran
[1:34:54.520 --> 1:34:57.720]  and the mainstream media and the government are trying to find some
[1:34:57.720 --> 1:34:59.880]  way that they can salvage this
[1:34:59.880 --> 1:35:03.000]  because the general public reaction mcclellan's book is
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:07.160]  uh... we knew it all along this is not really a shock
[1:35:07.160 --> 1:35:10.200]  people are saying yes we thought they were lying now the former white house
[1:35:10.200 --> 1:35:14.440]  press spokesman said they're lying we have not had this much of an insider
[1:35:14.440 --> 1:35:17.680]  blow the whistle since john dean did it on richard nixon
[1:35:17.680 --> 1:35:21.240]  and so trying to come up with a reason to invade iran right now
[1:35:21.240 --> 1:35:25.560]  is going to be very very difficult absent a new fault flag attack
[1:35:25.560 --> 1:35:27.680]  well i have to agree with you there and uh...
[1:35:27.680 --> 1:35:29.040]  you bring up israel
[1:35:29.040 --> 1:35:32.280]  uh... really wants me to get into my my next point about nine eleven
[1:35:32.280 --> 1:35:36.400]  and israel's role in nine eleven because i i have a huge section of my new film
[1:35:36.400 --> 1:35:38.080]  coming up off able enemies
[1:35:38.080 --> 1:35:40.920]  in what israel's role in nine eleven was
[1:35:40.920 --> 1:35:43.440]  and i actually found some new information i obviously went to what
[1:35:43.440 --> 1:35:45.360]  really happened dot com i checked out
[1:35:45.360 --> 1:35:48.840]  a lot of your stuff actually have that bob graham uh... thing from pbs in two
[1:35:48.840 --> 1:35:49.840]  thousand and two
[1:35:49.840 --> 1:35:53.360]  where he admits that foreign governments were involved in nine eleven not only in
[1:35:53.360 --> 1:35:54.200]  the funding
[1:35:54.200 --> 1:35:56.240]  uh... but other aspects as well
[1:35:56.240 --> 1:36:00.440]  uh... of course the famous fox piece where i did a four-part investigation
[1:36:00.440 --> 1:36:04.040]  and they had covered that there was this huge israeli spiring prior to nine eleven
[1:36:04.040 --> 1:36:05.320]  where people had been detained
[1:36:05.320 --> 1:36:07.040]  and then detained after nine eleven
[1:36:07.040 --> 1:36:08.560]  and it got into and
[1:36:08.560 --> 1:36:12.040]  and oxen converse which were these two israeli based companies
[1:36:12.040 --> 1:36:15.440]  uh... that that basically all of our telecommunications went through
[1:36:15.440 --> 1:36:17.080]  and they had penetrated
[1:36:17.080 --> 1:36:21.040]  every single intelligence agency from the secret service to the fb i'd to the
[1:36:21.040 --> 1:36:21.880]  ns a
[1:36:21.880 --> 1:36:23.880]  and even secret government offices
[1:36:23.880 --> 1:36:25.820]  which which i found stunning
[1:36:25.820 --> 1:36:29.720]  now i was wondering if you were familiar with an article called digital moles
[1:36:29.720 --> 1:36:31.200]  inside the white house
[1:36:31.200 --> 1:36:35.320]  that was printed by world that daily on i believe september twentieth
[1:36:35.320 --> 1:36:38.560]  our uh... right after the attacks but it was from debka files
[1:36:38.560 --> 1:36:39.720]  now debka
[1:36:39.720 --> 1:36:44.000]  is in israeli based website that deals mostly in intelligence
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:48.560]  and in this article it said that on the morning nine eleven the quote on quote
[1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:50.160]  people running the attack
[1:36:50.160 --> 1:36:53.960]  had infiltrated all the secret code words of not only the secret service the
[1:36:53.960 --> 1:36:56.160]  ns a the fb i the c i a
[1:36:56.160 --> 1:36:57.560]  but the f a a
[1:36:57.560 --> 1:37:01.480]  uh... naval intelligence army intelligence all these separate things and
[1:37:01.480 --> 1:37:04.920]  there were all these other attacks that were supposedly going to happen
[1:37:04.920 --> 1:37:06.160]  that they were phoning in
[1:37:06.160 --> 1:37:08.240]  now the spin they give it at the end
[1:37:08.240 --> 1:37:10.600]  is that a sound a lot and couldn't have done this
[1:37:10.600 --> 1:37:12.720]  but the that u.s. officials
[1:37:12.720 --> 1:37:16.160]  we're going to look towards iraqi intelligence as if iraq could penetrate
[1:37:16.160 --> 1:37:18.120]  all those different agencies
[1:37:18.120 --> 1:37:21.080]  and it really just struck me that in this article they named the same
[1:37:21.080 --> 1:37:25.440]  organizations that were named in that fox news report
[1:37:25.440 --> 1:37:28.760]  well up first of all my comment is if if you're really uh... going to the
[1:37:28.760 --> 1:37:31.880]  aspect of nine eleven why are you not coming out here to hawaii to do an
[1:37:31.880 --> 1:37:33.240]  interview on the beach
[1:37:33.240 --> 1:37:37.840]  but i have an uncle out with the girl around there i you know i have an
[1:37:37.840 --> 1:37:40.960]  uncle in hawaii i've been meaning to get out there i really wanted to get out
[1:37:40.960 --> 1:37:42.080]  there badly
[1:37:42.080 --> 1:37:44.960]  i've been telling them i'm coming i'm coming i'm coming i actually might
[1:37:44.960 --> 1:37:46.080]  come after
[1:37:46.080 --> 1:37:49.040]  i'm done with this film but you would be a good person to have an interview on
[1:37:49.040 --> 1:37:52.080]  this out you know although israel is going to be a big part of it i'm also
[1:37:52.080 --> 1:37:54.320]  going to cover you know pakistan's role
[1:37:54.320 --> 1:37:57.760]  uh... saudi arabia's role and really show how this is an international
[1:37:57.760 --> 1:37:58.760]  intelligence op
[1:37:58.760 --> 1:37:59.720]  and how
[1:37:59.720 --> 1:38:03.800]  each each patsy has its own little role to play for instance you know the
[1:38:03.800 --> 1:38:05.560]  hijackers get set up
[1:38:05.560 --> 1:38:08.440]  but they're being followed by these israeli moles they're being funded by
[1:38:08.440 --> 1:38:10.160]  pakistani intelligence
[1:38:10.160 --> 1:38:12.520]  the same guy who's in pakistani intelligence
[1:38:12.520 --> 1:38:16.360]  uh... general memud Ahmed who's helping fund these guys is also part of a
[1:38:16.360 --> 1:38:17.360]  turkish
[1:38:17.360 --> 1:38:20.720]  and uh... israeli spiring that's trading nuclear secrets according to
[1:38:20.720 --> 1:38:21.760]  sebel admins
[1:38:21.760 --> 1:38:25.240]  you know and that that information has been far from public it was reported on
[1:38:25.240 --> 1:38:27.120]  the times online and that's about it
[1:38:27.120 --> 1:38:30.800]  and they were working with household names within the united states government
[1:38:30.800 --> 1:38:31.880]  i believe she named
[1:38:31.880 --> 1:38:35.120]  mark grossman and only the brad blog would actually name him
[1:38:35.120 --> 1:38:38.720]  but she said you know all these other guys she's also mentioned hazard
[1:38:38.720 --> 1:38:41.520]  in her uh... in her movie uh... kill the messenger
[1:38:41.520 --> 1:38:44.600]  so i'm really going to try to name names and point out these connections
[1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:45.760]  michael
[1:38:45.760 --> 1:38:48.960]  okay well i was just trying to find some way that you could have a hawaii
[1:38:48.960 --> 1:38:52.160]  vacation and charge it off the business expense but getting back to what you were
[1:38:52.160 --> 1:38:53.840]  saying about the phone systems
[1:38:53.840 --> 1:38:56.920]  the compromise of our government phone systems goes back
[1:38:56.920 --> 1:39:00.280]  uh... at least as far as the clinton administration when the clinton came in
[1:39:00.280 --> 1:39:01.800]  they completely overhauled
[1:39:01.800 --> 1:39:03.760]  the white house telephone system
[1:39:03.760 --> 1:39:07.400]  uh... it was known that were private untraceable lines that were being put in
[1:39:07.400 --> 1:39:09.440]  there so that the white house personnel
[1:39:09.440 --> 1:39:12.960]  uh... could have phone calls that were not being recorded or tracked or or
[1:39:12.960 --> 1:39:14.560]  records were being kept a bit
[1:39:14.560 --> 1:39:18.840]  so there was uh... and it was an israeli company that was involved with that
[1:39:18.840 --> 1:39:20.160]  we also know
[1:39:20.160 --> 1:39:25.520]  that uh... uh... israel was making tapes of bill clinton phone sections with
[1:39:25.520 --> 1:39:28.560]  monica lewinsky and using them to blackmail him
[1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:30.680]  into calling off the hunt
[1:39:30.680 --> 1:39:34.680]  for israel's top agent inside the government code named mega
[1:39:34.680 --> 1:39:39.440]  uh... that eluded to in kenneth star's whitewater report as well
[1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:41.720]  uh... we also know that israel
[1:39:41.720 --> 1:39:46.240]  has a very long history of fault flag attacks of carrying out terrorist
[1:39:46.240 --> 1:39:46.920]  actions
[1:39:46.920 --> 1:39:49.200]  in order to blame on a third party
[1:39:49.200 --> 1:39:50.920]  now psychologists call this
[1:39:50.920 --> 1:39:55.080]  let's you and him fight when this is played by individuals we've all seen you
[1:39:55.080 --> 1:39:58.400]  know our work people who just seem to love to trick other people into getting
[1:39:58.400 --> 1:39:59.760]  into fight that kind of a
[1:39:59.760 --> 1:40:01.800]  a sense of empowerment when they really
[1:40:01.800 --> 1:40:05.360]  uh... aren't able to take care of their own issues but on the national level
[1:40:05.360 --> 1:40:08.880]  history is uh... has shown that israel will go out
[1:40:08.880 --> 1:40:13.040]  stage an attack plant evidence to frame other people one time it really blew up
[1:40:13.040 --> 1:40:16.080]  in their faces was back in the nineteen fifties with what's called the levon
[1:40:16.080 --> 1:40:16.800]  affair
[1:40:16.800 --> 1:40:21.440]  where israeli agents inside egypt were bombing british and american targets
[1:40:21.440 --> 1:40:25.840]  and planting evidence to frame the egyptian the goal was to destroy
[1:40:25.840 --> 1:40:29.560]  diplomatic relations between the united states in egypt and great britain
[1:40:29.560 --> 1:40:35.560]  in egypt to further isolate uh... them and to basically guarantee that u s and
[1:40:35.560 --> 1:40:40.280]  british interest were more alive with israel than anybody else we have seen
[1:40:40.280 --> 1:40:43.440]  it repeated the bombing of the king david hotel was carried out by israeli
[1:40:43.440 --> 1:40:48.280]  agents dressed as arabs we i know from big victor astrosky an ex most odd
[1:40:48.280 --> 1:40:53.240]  agent that israel planted a fake uh... radio transmitted to broadcast fake
[1:40:53.240 --> 1:40:58.640]  radio messages in triply to trick reagan into bombing libya there are many
[1:40:58.640 --> 1:41:02.840]  people including myself who believe that the attack on the u s s coal like the
[1:41:02.840 --> 1:41:07.280]  attack on the u s s liberty was done by israel with the goal of framing another
[1:41:07.280 --> 1:41:12.120]  country for to trick the u s into an attack on that country and of course
[1:41:12.120 --> 1:41:18.200]  bring except to nine eleven uh... you know it obviously if israel did in fact
[1:41:18.200 --> 1:41:23.080]  at least help in carrying this out their goal was to get the u s to go kill
[1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:26.960]  israel's enemies and if you look to the media in the history of uh... you go
[1:41:26.960 --> 1:41:30.720]  back to the archives of all the major newspapers for two thousand one two
[1:41:30.720 --> 1:41:34.560]  thousand two two thousand three it was always israel says we need to attack
[1:41:34.560 --> 1:41:39.640]  iraq israel says go in iraq is a danger iraq has weapons of mass destruction
[1:41:39.640 --> 1:41:44.400]  because senator mccain and and bill o'reilly are wrong on a key point
[1:41:44.400 --> 1:41:48.640]  it was not every intelligence agency in the world thought to them had nuclear
[1:41:48.640 --> 1:41:50.000]  weapons
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:53.800]  absolutely wrong russia said they didn't germany said they didn't uh... france
[1:41:53.800 --> 1:41:58.280]  said they didn't uh... we even have kondi rice and colon power on videotape in
[1:41:58.280 --> 1:42:01.360]  two thousand and one thing to them had been to say uh... disarmed and would
[1:42:01.360 --> 1:42:05.000]  be a threat for over fifteen years absolutely i've seen those videos and
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:08.400]  and yeah they they were in a threat at that point and they had to make them a
[1:42:08.400 --> 1:42:11.840]  threat and i i think that's why there's that's been in the article i was wondering
[1:42:11.840 --> 1:42:15.440]  if you've heard uh... you know johnathan ellen off over at truth alliance dot net
[1:42:15.440 --> 1:42:18.840]  does some really interesting work and he brought this to my attention had you
[1:42:18.840 --> 1:42:22.880]  heard of the flatbed truck that was painted up like new york city on the
[1:42:22.880 --> 1:42:26.680]  morning of nine eleven with the twin towers being hit by a plane
[1:42:26.680 --> 1:42:29.200]  and these guys were pulled over they were middle easterners
[1:42:29.200 --> 1:42:32.800]  it turned out that they had rented the van it looked like it went back to urban
[1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:33.840]  moving systems
[1:42:33.840 --> 1:42:36.920]  and on the same audio clip which you can find over at truth alliance i'm gonna
[1:42:36.920 --> 1:42:37.760]  try to play
[1:42:37.760 --> 1:42:40.000]  some of the stuff in the next segment there's some curses so i have to be
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:41.400]  careful
[1:42:41.400 --> 1:42:44.920]  one of those urban moving system vans also explodes
[1:42:44.920 --> 1:42:48.920]  and uh... the guys get out of the the uh... the uh... van it blows up
[1:42:48.920 --> 1:42:52.560]  and then they're detained and i had never heard of any of these trucks actually
[1:42:52.560 --> 1:42:55.200]  blowing up and i'd never heard of the flatbed truck
[1:42:55.200 --> 1:42:58.920]  that was painted up like new york city but it actually makes on normanette is
[1:42:58.920 --> 1:43:03.560]  two thousand six report there's an actual paragraph about i couldn't believe it
[1:43:03.560 --> 1:43:07.560]  well i've not heard about any of the trucks actually exploding i had heard
[1:43:07.560 --> 1:43:11.280]  that some of the urban moving truck had tested positive for explosives
[1:43:11.280 --> 1:43:13.800]  uh... with the uh... the csi teams
[1:43:13.800 --> 1:43:17.400]  um... i'd also of course we've all heard about the dancing israelis who were
[1:43:17.400 --> 1:43:19.240]  arrested for videotaping
[1:43:19.240 --> 1:43:21.680]  uh... the attack on the world trade towers
[1:43:21.680 --> 1:43:24.320]  and the part that is really very critical is
[1:43:24.320 --> 1:43:27.640]  that videotape remains classified to this very day
[1:43:27.640 --> 1:43:31.160]  and what a lot of people what what my sources are telling me is
[1:43:31.160 --> 1:43:35.480]  the first impact is on that videotape which absolutely proves they knew in
[1:43:35.480 --> 1:43:37.440]  advance what was going to happen
[1:43:37.440 --> 1:43:40.760]  but uh... again that's part of the evidence that is classified by the u
[1:43:40.760 --> 1:43:43.600]  s government uh... pearl carl carman's news report
[1:43:43.600 --> 1:43:46.760]  yeah yeah from all the research i've done they were taking that first attack
[1:43:46.760 --> 1:43:48.000]  prior to happening
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:50.880]  and they went on that uh... television program the three of them that were
[1:43:50.880 --> 1:43:52.160]  detained doing that
[1:43:52.160 --> 1:43:54.840]  uh... saying it was their job to record the event
[1:43:54.840 --> 1:43:58.320]  uh... you know a lot of these guys failed polygraph tests and uh...
[1:43:58.320 --> 1:44:00.960]  it's something that needs to be looked at i mean if we're really gonna take the
[1:44:00.960 --> 1:44:04.360]  step next step in on nine eleven truth it's it's time to start
[1:44:04.360 --> 1:44:07.720]  naming names and organizations and what roles they played
[1:44:07.720 --> 1:44:10.640]  if we really want to bring these people to justice because
[1:44:10.640 --> 1:44:14.320]  you know it's almost seven years on now mike and our entire foreign domestic
[1:44:14.320 --> 1:44:15.560]  policy
[1:44:15.560 --> 1:44:18.800]  has still been based on the lie that has been perpetrated about nine eleven
[1:44:18.800 --> 1:44:20.720]  from both the mainstream media
[1:44:20.720 --> 1:44:23.640]  and our government and governments around the world really
[1:44:23.640 --> 1:44:26.320]  so you know i'm i'm trying to put this stuff out there
[1:44:26.320 --> 1:44:27.840]  i thought it was
[1:44:27.840 --> 1:44:30.440]  explosive that someone would have
[1:44:30.440 --> 1:44:35.560]  a flatbed truck with the actual attacks on it on the morning of nine eleven
[1:44:35.560 --> 1:44:38.520]  and that's not common knowledge
[1:44:38.520 --> 1:44:42.200]  well again that one i hadn't heard the one about the exploding truck i hadn't
[1:44:42.200 --> 1:44:44.720]  heard i mean there were a lot of stories floating around
[1:44:44.720 --> 1:44:48.160]  but for me the bottom line about nine eleven is
[1:44:48.160 --> 1:44:52.320]  george bush sitting in that classroom and the secret service not moving him
[1:44:52.320 --> 1:44:55.920]  out even though they know the second plane at the tower that tells me they
[1:44:55.920 --> 1:44:58.720]  all knew what the targets were and that's why they knew bush was safe well
[1:44:58.720 --> 1:45:01.800]  so secret service should have pulled him out if they didn't know he was safe i'm
[1:45:01.800 --> 1:45:05.200]  gonna play those clips right now i'm gonna try to cut the cursing out so
[1:45:05.200 --> 1:45:08.520]  uh... bear with me this is going to talk about the painted truck first and then
[1:45:08.520 --> 1:45:09.800]  the exploding truck
[1:45:09.800 --> 1:45:12.880]  second and then the paint paint truck will will come up again these are
[1:45:12.880 --> 1:45:19.880]  uh... the actual police tape spokes from that morning
[1:45:50.080 --> 1:45:53.280]  and
[1:45:53.280 --> 1:46:02.280]  Airplane, diving into New York blown up. Two men got out of the truck, ran away from it. We got those to move under.
[1:46:02.280 --> 1:46:04.280]  That's good.
[1:46:07.280 --> 1:46:12.280]  Listen, you need any support on those two guys over there? You all right over there?
[1:46:12.280 --> 1:46:21.280]  Yeah, both suspects under K. We have the suspects who dribbled, throwing a van that had exploded. We have both of them under K.
[1:46:21.280 --> 1:46:26.280]  I'm sending you a shooter. I just want to make sure you guys are all right over there, K. That's all.
[1:46:26.280 --> 1:46:28.280]  What's the location?
[1:46:28.280 --> 1:46:29.280]  What about? What about?
[1:46:29.280 --> 1:46:33.280]  You know, we have two friends living, that exploded. Is that all right?
[1:46:33.280 --> 1:46:34.280]  What location?
[1:46:34.280 --> 1:46:36.280]  What location, K?
[1:46:42.280 --> 1:46:50.280]  All right, so there they are talking about a mural painted on a big truck of the attacks happening and that a van had exploded
[1:46:50.280 --> 1:46:55.280]  and that they were after the suspects. You know, this stuff doesn't make the 9-11 commission report.
[1:46:55.280 --> 1:47:05.280]  It doesn't make the congressional investigation with 27 redacted pages. All these Israelis were let go, I believe, in December of 2002, was it, Mike?
[1:47:05.280 --> 1:47:11.280]  Some of them were let go earlier than that. A lot of them, you know, got out after just 30, 60 days.
[1:47:11.280 --> 1:47:18.280]  We know the owner of urban moving systems basically abandoned his home and his business and fled to Israel like two days later.
[1:47:18.280 --> 1:47:23.280]  Yeah, that is absolutely true and there's no doubt that that was an intelligence front.
[1:47:23.280 --> 1:47:31.280]  I don't know if you've seen the documentary, Protocols of Zion, but they really try to, you know, poo-poo all of the Israeli information
[1:47:31.280 --> 1:47:34.280]  and, of course, make it about the Jews and anti-Semitism.
[1:47:34.280 --> 1:47:40.280]  But when they go and interview the people such as the woman who called the police on the guys who were surveilling,
[1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:47.280]  she was very adamant that they did not look upset, they didn't look shocked, they were there, they looked like they were celebrating and happy.
[1:47:47.280 --> 1:47:54.280]  They talked to one of the police officers that had pulled over the initial van and, you know, he talked about the incident where they said that they were our friends
[1:47:54.280 --> 1:47:57.280]  and that they were here to help and he didn't trust them.
[1:47:57.280 --> 1:48:01.280]  So this information is out there, I think it needs to be looked into.
[1:48:01.280 --> 1:48:07.280]  They definitely had an operational role in 9-11 and with all the war games going on that morning and all the confusion,
[1:48:07.280 --> 1:48:16.280]  I'm sure you've heard a lot of the jersey tapes where people were calling in, one person called in and said that they thought they saw Arabs in a van mixing explosives,
[1:48:16.280 --> 1:48:20.280]  which I think is really suspect. These vans aren't very easy to see into.
[1:48:20.280 --> 1:48:26.280]  How could you make out that they were actually Arabs and then how could you make out that they were mixing explosives?
[1:48:26.280 --> 1:48:35.280]  Well, remember the night before 9-11, there was a group of individuals who were going into all these bars in New York and making a lot of noise.
[1:48:35.280 --> 1:48:44.280]  They were trying to attract attention and talking about tomorrow the Arabs will rise and, you know, and they were just making all these declaratory statements.
[1:48:44.280 --> 1:48:50.280]  One of them made a point of leaving his phony ID with a bartender to make sure the bartender would have it the next morning.
[1:48:50.280 --> 1:48:57.280]  Obviously, they were planning all this information. They were going out of their way to lay a false trail to the Patsy's.
[1:48:57.280 --> 1:49:06.280]  I think a lot of people were making phone calls during 9-11 to the police in order to plan information saying there are Arabs here, there are Arabs there,
[1:49:06.280 --> 1:49:12.280]  and it was all very heavy handed and a lot of people fell for it because the mainstream media was going along with that.
[1:49:12.280 --> 1:49:19.280]  But yes, a lot of this stuff is very obviously planted information because, as you say, how can you actually see inside the van?
[1:49:19.280 --> 1:49:22.280]  How can you see that they're mixing explosives?
[1:49:22.280 --> 1:49:27.280]  Frankly, if I were going to carry out that kind of a terror attack, I would have everything kind of ready to go ahead of time.
[1:49:27.280 --> 1:49:30.280]  I wouldn't be mixing it up right in the middle of everything.
[1:49:30.280 --> 1:49:35.280]  Plus, of course, that all these claims about bombs at the tunnels and stuff turned out not to exist in the first place.
[1:49:35.280 --> 1:49:44.280]  Yes, it's very suspicious and it seems to me that they had actual ops and then false ops to lead like rabbit trails and that sort of thing.
[1:49:44.280 --> 1:49:50.280]  One of the things I actually knew something was up before 9-11 actually happened and I wrote about this.
[1:49:50.280 --> 1:49:53.280]  I was still on good terms with Free Republic at the time.
[1:49:53.280 --> 1:49:59.280]  But all throughout August of 2001, I had been noticing all these news stories about Osama bin Laden.
[1:49:59.280 --> 1:50:04.280]  It was obvious because he hadn't actually done anything to be newsworthy.
[1:50:04.280 --> 1:50:09.280]  These were just stories to say, oh yes, Osama's out there and he's a bad guy and he hates us.
[1:50:09.280 --> 1:50:13.280]  And there were so many of them and I said, you know, this feels like a PR run-up.
[1:50:13.280 --> 1:50:20.280]  We're being pre-sold that this guy is the evil villain of the galaxy and something's going to happen that's going to involve him.
[1:50:20.280 --> 1:50:24.280]  And I wrote this over at Free Republic and, of course, they pooped me and said, how silly can you be?
[1:50:24.280 --> 1:50:30.280]  And then, of course, as soon as 9-11 happens, you've got the talking heads on the TV saying, oh yes, this must be the work of Osama bin Laden.
[1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:34.280]  And I'm sitting there in my living room going bingo. There it is.
[1:50:34.280 --> 1:50:38.280]  Well, final segment coming up with Michael Rivera of whatreallyhappened.com.

[1:54:27.280 --> 1:54:33.280]  I'm Jason Burma, so I'm going to be here for the rest of the week as Alex Gallivants off to Bilderberg.
[1:54:33.280 --> 1:54:36.280]  It's going to be an exciting time. It's over in Chantilly, Virginia this year,
[1:54:36.280 --> 1:54:41.280]  and the last time it was actually in Chantilly, Virginia was in 2002.
[1:54:41.280 --> 1:54:47.280]  I believe it was the first Bilderberg meeting after 9-11. It's where they decided to invade Iraq in 2003,
[1:54:47.280 --> 1:54:53.280]  and made a lot of other decisions there. We're going to get into that later on with Jim Tucker.
[1:54:53.280 --> 1:54:59.280]  We have Richard C. Cook about the economy on next, and right now we're talking to Michael Rivera.
[1:54:59.280 --> 1:55:03.280]  Michael, why don't you give us a six month forecast? What are you things coming up?
[1:55:03.280 --> 1:55:10.280]  I know we discussed Obama and Hillary earlier. Let's really predict what's going to happen in the next six months in this country.
[1:55:10.280 --> 1:55:17.280]  Well, boy, that's a tall order there. Obviously the economy is going to continue to deteriorate,
[1:55:17.280 --> 1:55:22.280]  and I think in fact the deterioration is going to accelerate.
[1:55:22.280 --> 1:55:27.280]  I was originally thinking we might see the bottoming of the real estate market early next year.
[1:55:27.280 --> 1:55:33.280]  Now I'm not so sure. I think it may be more toward the end of next year before we start to see a recovery from that.
[1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:38.280]  The part that is most alarming about the next six months, because this is an election year,
[1:55:38.280 --> 1:55:46.280]  our candidates, presidential, congressional, local, are doing little more than paying lip service to the realities of the economy.
[1:55:46.280 --> 1:55:51.280]  And certainly they're uniting in their condemnation of Scott McClellan's book,
[1:55:51.280 --> 1:55:56.280]  because the war has become an election loser for all the incumbent candidates.
[1:55:56.280 --> 1:56:04.280]  And so as we saw with McCain, they're trying to justify their own actions in promoting and supporting and selling the war.
[1:56:04.280 --> 1:56:09.280]  I think most Americans are not going to buy it, and I think when we get into November elections,
[1:56:09.280 --> 1:56:13.280]  we're going to see a real anti-encompassing feeling.
[1:56:13.280 --> 1:56:18.280]  We're going to see a real turning on everybody who supported the war.
[1:56:18.280 --> 1:56:25.280]  I think also because of the obviousness and heavy handedness with which APAC is fanning the flames of war
[1:56:25.280 --> 1:56:32.280]  and supporting those candidates who favor war, I think that we're probably going to see a strongly anti-APAC sentiment
[1:56:32.280 --> 1:56:36.280]  in the ballot boxes this November.
[1:56:36.280 --> 1:56:40.280]  Countering that, of course, I think we're going to see the vote-frob problem continue to escalate.
[1:56:40.280 --> 1:56:44.280]  We're not going to see the mainstream media cover it because they're part of the problem.
[1:56:44.280 --> 1:56:52.280]  We're going to continue to see the federal government try and reassert and reinforce the use of electronic voting machines,
[1:56:52.280 --> 1:56:59.280]  even though more and more local governments are getting rid of them because of all the problems that they're having with them.
[1:56:59.280 --> 1:57:06.280]  So it is definitely a time of turmoil and chaos, but if there's one thing I'd like to remind everybody to be thinking about
[1:57:06.280 --> 1:57:15.280]  in the next six months, Scott McClellan's book absolutely proved that we were lied to about the reasons to go to war in Iraq.
[1:57:15.280 --> 1:57:21.280]  And now the important question that every American needs to be asking themselves is, what else have we been lied to about?
[1:57:21.280 --> 1:57:25.280]  And the answer may very well be everything.
[1:57:25.280 --> 1:57:31.280]  And so the burden of proof is now on the government and the mainstream media and the schools to prove every claim they make.
[1:57:31.280 --> 1:57:34.280]  We don't have to prove they're lying anymore.
[1:57:34.280 --> 1:57:37.280]  Okay, the crisis of credibility is on them.
[1:57:37.280 --> 1:57:40.280]  When they say Iran is a threat, prove it.
[1:57:40.280 --> 1:57:44.280]  When they say that we have to give Israel money because they're helpless, they got to prove it.
[1:57:44.280 --> 1:57:50.280]  Everything we've ever been taught and told is now subject to suspicion and re-examination.
[1:57:50.280 --> 1:57:58.280]  I'm with you there, Mike, and I think it was subject to that in the months after 9-11 when a lot of this information started to come out
[1:57:58.280 --> 1:58:01.280]  that they were in fact lying to us about the attacks.
[1:58:01.280 --> 1:58:04.280]  It's been a long road to try to get the mainstream to listen to this stuff.
[1:58:04.280 --> 1:58:06.280]  It's whatreallyhappened.com.
[1:58:06.280 --> 1:58:11.280]  And on the other side, folks, I'm going to play a little bit of an interview that was done by George Butler with McClellan's mother.
[1:58:11.280 --> 1:58:16.280]  And Alex asked some questions about five minutes on the other side, and we're going to have Richard Cook.
[1:58:16.280 --> 1:58:19.280]  Thanks again, Michael, for coming on the show.
[1:58:19.280 --> 1:58:21.280]  Thanks for having me. Talk to you soon.
[1:58:21.280 --> 1:58:50.280]  We'll be right back.

[1:59:43.280 --> 1:59:45.280]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:59:45.280 --> 1:59:49.280]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:59:49.280 --> 1:59:56.280]  All right, we're back, and this is going to be the interview with Alex Jones on the George Butler question for Carol Strayhorn.
[1:59:56.280 --> 2:00:06.280]  Well, I do. I just want to say that my view of Mrs. Strayhorn and her son, Scott McClellan, has gone from decent to just super high.
[2:00:06.280 --> 2:00:11.280]  Seeing this happen, I just wanted to call in and ask her three quick questions and get off,
[2:00:11.280 --> 2:00:15.280]  and I'm just going to ask the questions and then get off, or I can wait and hear the answer.
[2:00:15.280 --> 2:00:22.280]  Hey, did they try to suppress the book? How did they keep it under wraps from the White House trying to pressure him?
[2:00:22.280 --> 2:00:24.280]  Or was there any pressure?
[2:00:24.280 --> 2:00:34.280]  Me, what do you think of them trying to deny this when all the CIA documents and all the admissions admit that her son is telling the truth?
[2:00:34.280 --> 2:00:44.280]  And then the final question is, could this be what starts something like Watergate? Because a lot of top lawyers and prosecutors are saying,
[2:00:44.280 --> 2:00:53.280]  we've got a million dead Iraqis. This is so criminal. There needs to be charges or impeachment against George W. Bush and his neocon crony.
[2:00:53.280 --> 2:00:57.280]  So she's a sharp lady. You know, there's three complex questions.
[2:00:57.280 --> 2:01:05.280]  And first of all, Alex, let me say thank you so much when you say it doesn't matter what people think about me,
[2:01:05.280 --> 2:01:11.280]  but it does matter to me what people think about my son. And thank you for your warm comments.
[2:01:11.280 --> 2:01:20.280]  And let me say that I wish Scott, we'll have to get Scott on with you sometime, George. He can really answer these questions.
[2:01:20.280 --> 2:01:32.280]  Let me say I do not know of anyone trying to suppress it. I do know that the book was given to the White House early because,
[2:01:32.280 --> 2:01:40.280]  and I don't know anything about the process. I really don't, but I know that the Secret Service got a copy of it.
[2:01:40.280 --> 2:01:46.280]  Now, whether Scott had to do that or wanted to do that or didn't care if they saw it early, but he gave it to him early.
[2:01:46.280 --> 2:01:50.280]  And I don't know that that's required or whether he did it. I mean, he certainly didn't.
[2:01:50.280 --> 2:01:58.280]  And so, you know, to see if there's anything of great, you know, I guess something that would involve some sort of security, something.
[2:01:58.280 --> 2:02:04.280]  But so I know they had the book early. I don't know how early, but I don't know whether it's week.
[2:02:04.280 --> 2:02:05.280]  I don't know how early.
[2:02:05.280 --> 2:02:15.280]  The other question, Carol, was something about there were statements made by some representatives or something that they wanted to call some kind of special hearings.
[2:02:15.280 --> 2:02:22.280]  Oh, yeah. And I was going to go on to the other question. I know that when they said, you're asking, did they, about denying it?
[2:02:22.280 --> 2:02:28.280]  I can't remember exactly. I know you had something about denying it. You know, I just know what I'm hearing Scott say.
[2:02:28.280 --> 2:02:33.280]  I mean, I was not there. Scott was. But I mean, it's like on the Stude or Rivie Carl Rose thing.
[2:02:33.280 --> 2:02:39.280]  Scott asked them directly if they had, and I'm paraphrasing. You'll have to look at his exact words in the book.
[2:02:39.280 --> 2:02:45.280]  But they didn't know anything about it. He asked each of them directly and the answer was that they did not.
[2:02:45.280 --> 2:02:58.280]  And then I heard a robe again today, or at least a statement from him on some show saying that, you know, that that one, the question that Scott had asked, he'd asked if he leaked Valerie Flane.
[2:02:58.280 --> 2:03:01.280]  That's not, that's not correct. I'm just quoting my son.
[2:03:01.280 --> 2:03:09.280]  We've got to take one who can answer that. And so, and then, and then it said two years later, he finds out he has been lied to.
[2:03:09.280 --> 2:03:12.280]  And at that time, I know that was when the White House told him.
[2:03:12.280 --> 2:03:16.280]  Okay, we've got to come right back. We'll take a quick break.
[2:03:16.280 --> 2:03:18.280]  Welcome back, Carol Strayhorn.
[2:03:18.280 --> 2:03:22.280]  Thank you. And I think I left one question unanswered for Alex.
[2:03:22.280 --> 2:03:27.280]  Okay. And I'm answering these as best I can. Obviously, if you had Scott, he could answer them. I was not there.
[2:03:27.280 --> 2:03:31.280]  I do not know what happened, but Scott does know what happened.
[2:03:31.280 --> 2:03:46.280]  And on third question, I really cannot speak to that from my knowledge, other than knowing that I know that the Judiciary Committee is talking publicly about having Scott inviting Scott to come visit with them.
[2:03:46.280 --> 2:03:57.280]  And, and, you know, the very name of the book of George and Charlotte is so Scott. I mean, that is, that is Scott. What happened?
[2:03:57.280 --> 2:04:01.280]  It's what happened inside the Bush White House in Washington's cultural deception.
[2:04:01.280 --> 2:04:09.280]  I would, you know, Scott is a very, he's a very calm, he's a very thoughtful, he's a very deep thinking person.
[2:04:09.280 --> 2:04:21.280]  People misunderstand, I think maybe perhaps misinterpret that quiet demeanor. I think once it was New York Times wrote an article about me and the boys and they talked about how they were calm, how their mother was a bit more bombastic.
[2:04:21.280 --> 2:04:32.280]  I think I certainly am, but the very last chapter in his book talks about changing the culture of deception. And that, and that's what's so important.
[2:04:32.280 --> 2:04:40.280]  But he talks about what happened in the book and he says this is his perspective, but the truth is he knows it and he believes that this is what happened.
[2:04:40.280 --> 2:04:42.280]  Alex Mostyn, do you have a question?
[2:04:42.280 --> 2:04:47.280]  And there you have it. That's Alex Jones on the George Butler Show. That's on GCN and WP.
[2:04:47.280 --> 2:04:52.280]  Wake up, Protestant America. There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[2:04:52.280 --> 2:05:02.280]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting block. Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[2:05:02.280 --> 2:05:07.280]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty of conscience.
[2:05:07.280 --> 2:05:16.280]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate. It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[2:05:16.280 --> 2:05:24.280]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement. From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[2:05:24.280 --> 2:05:30.280]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation. America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[2:05:30.280 --> 2:05:37.280]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late. The prophecies are fast fulfilling. Jesus is coming soon.
[2:05:37.280 --> 2:05:46.280]  Our free materials call 888-211-1715 or write the Bible says Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee 37771.
[2:05:46.280 --> 2:05:54.280]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope.
[2:05:54.280 --> 2:06:03.280]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[2:06:03.280 --> 2:06:07.280]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[2:07:47.280 --> 2:08:01.280]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:01.280 --> 2:08:14.280]  All right, we are back. It is the Alex Jones show. I'm Jason Bermas subbing in and you just listened to Scott McClellan's mother, the former White House Press Secretary on George Butler's GCNW TPR and radio program.
[2:08:14.280 --> 2:08:20.280]  Alex is doing his best to try to get her on the show and talk to her for a full hour.
[2:08:20.280 --> 2:08:33.280]  It's really interesting times when the former Press Secretary comes out with such a scathing book telling us what we already knew that Bush and Cheney are essentially liars, not only on the Iraq War and Scooter Libby, but many other issues.
[2:08:33.280 --> 2:08:43.280]  That being said, we have another guest on the line right now. We have Richard C. Cook, who has written a challenge or revealed, and he's also an economic forecaster.
[2:08:43.280 --> 2:08:57.280]  That's what we're going to be discussing with him today is what is going to happen with the economy. What's happening now? Where's it going? What should we do to take steps to make sure that we're going to be okay, that we're going to be safe in this very tumultuous time?
[2:08:57.280 --> 2:08:58.280]  Richard, are you with us?
[2:08:58.280 --> 2:09:00.280]  Yes, hi, Jason. How are you doing?
[2:09:00.280 --> 2:09:01.280]  Good. How are you?
[2:09:01.280 --> 2:09:02.280]  Very good.
[2:09:02.280 --> 2:09:15.280]  So let's just get right into it. I mean, gas is over the top right now. People are paying a lot of taxes. The economy is not that great. What do you see happening now and say in the next three months?
[2:09:15.280 --> 2:09:25.280]  Well, I think that we need to understand that it's not a question of when is a recession going to come or if a recession is going to come.
[2:09:25.280 --> 2:09:38.280]  The producing economy, and that's the economy where people like you and me go to work and make things and perform services for a living rather than try to live off of investments.
[2:09:38.280 --> 2:09:54.280]  That economy has been in a recession for well over a year. If you look at the Federal Reserve figures for M1, which is the cash and money and checking accounts that people have to spend every day, that's been in a decline for about a year and a half now.
[2:09:54.280 --> 2:10:06.280]  We are in a recession, and the recession is getting worse every day because of the drop in the value of the dollar, which is reflected in the skyrocketing costs for fuel and now for food.
[2:10:06.280 --> 2:10:15.280]  This is going to continue because no one is doing anything to stop it. It's something that has been a long time coming.
[2:10:15.280 --> 2:10:35.280]  The whole problem was made worse by the conversion of large amounts of crops to ethanol, and we're also seeing the effects of these huge amounts of speculative credit in the futures markets and in the commodities markets that are driving up costs and keeping those costs high.
[2:10:35.280 --> 2:10:51.280]  What they are trying to do right now is to keep the economy afloat until the presidential election takes place in November. They don't want to rock the boat. They're pretty much designated who the candidates are going to be.
[2:10:51.280 --> 2:11:14.280]  It's going to be McCain and it's going to be Obama. We've got to keep things on an even keel. They're thinking until November, so nobody steps in with any kind of radical proposals. Then I believe they're going to allow the economy to more or less collapse into a long-term recession and even a depression.
[2:11:14.280 --> 2:11:42.280]  We're talking 1929-style levels in a technological society that's far surpassed that. I was shocked to learn, I'm from New York and my brother called me a week and a half ago and said that they were putting limitations on the amount of bags of rice he could buy over at Sam's Club and BJ's wholesale club, which is shocking to me in America that we would ever get to a point where we're actually rationing our food and not allowing people to buy as much as they possibly can.
[2:11:42.280 --> 2:12:00.280]  Well, I think it's going to be worse than the Great Depression for one very simple reason. During the Great Depression, there were a lot more farms in America. A lot more people lived on farms. They had the ability to grow their own food.
[2:12:00.280 --> 2:12:19.280]  During the Depression, I read a really interesting book recently about Appalachia, because that by and large was a very huge agricultural region that people moved out of after World War II and they migrated to the cities, but that migration had been going on for quite a long time.
[2:12:19.280 --> 2:12:31.280]  During the 30s, the Great Depression, a lot of people moved back to the farms, back to the countryside, because that was where they could live. They could go to the old home place and grow food and have some kind of a life.
[2:12:31.280 --> 2:12:41.280]  We don't even have that anymore. We have destroyed family agriculture in the United States. It had been in decline for a very long time, but NAFTA finished it off.
[2:12:41.280 --> 2:12:53.280]  NAFTA destroyed family farming in Canada, in the U.S., and in Mexico. A nation that does not have the ability to feed itself is in a very, very perilous condition.
[2:12:53.280 --> 2:13:06.280]  It's been well documented that food stores around the world, including in the United States, have declined in the last decade through the policies of NAFTA and the World Trade Organization.
[2:13:06.280 --> 2:13:21.280]  People say it can't happen here, but we've already got 35 million people who are officially classified as undernourished. The numbers enrolled in food stamps is going up even as we speak, so I think there's real danger there.
[2:13:21.280 --> 2:13:35.280]  That's why one of the things I'm recommending to people, very seriously, start your garden, establish local food co-ops, and get the ability back to feed yourself. A nation that cannot feed itself is in a very perilous situation.
[2:13:35.280 --> 2:13:42.280]  I agree with you there. So what do you think will happen? Say this depression does come, and it is just terrible for us.
[2:13:42.280 --> 2:13:54.280]  We're already below the currency of, say, Canada. The loonie is worth a little bit more than the dollar when, you know, throughout history, within the last 20 years, really, the dollar has dominated Canadian currency.
[2:13:54.280 --> 2:14:06.280]  It's no longer the case. Do you feel like they're trying to set us on a level with the peso so it'll be easier to come up with a North American currency and a marrow, if you will, or whatever they'd like to call it?
[2:14:06.280 --> 2:14:20.280]  Yeah, I think that's the case. We're looking at a very long-term plan that's been in the works for a long time to eliminate the United States as the greatest industrial democracy in the world.
[2:14:20.280 --> 2:14:33.280]  This really began in earnest during the 1970s when we became completely dependent on foreign nations for oil. That was something that was done deliberately.
[2:14:33.280 --> 2:14:46.280]  It was done by the Nixon administration, which made agreements with Saudi Arabia and the other OPEC nations that they were going to drastically increase the prices of gasoline.
[2:14:46.280 --> 2:14:51.280]  This wasn't something that happened because of supply and demand. It was a deliberate policy.
[2:14:51.280 --> 2:15:08.280]  And then the OPEC nations agreed to turn around and buy U.S. government debt from our Treasury departments or Treasury bonds because we were tipping over into a fiscal and a trade deficit and losing the status as the world's greatest creditor and becoming the world's greatest debtor.
[2:15:08.280 --> 2:15:23.280]  So this has been going on a long time. Then you had during the 1970s the rise of these prices that led to the Federal Reserve crash of the economy in 1979 and the recession of 1979 to 1983.
[2:15:23.280 --> 2:15:35.280]  That's when our steel industry collapsed, our automobile industry went into decline, our other heavy industries began to disappear, and that's when we stopped being an industrial nation and became the so-called service economy.
[2:15:35.280 --> 2:15:49.280]  What people don't understand is that this just didn't happen. This was the plan, and it was part of a long-term plan to make the United States just another member of the Anglo-American Empire, if you want to look at it that way,
[2:15:49.280 --> 2:16:00.280]  with our specific job being to provide the military might to go around the world enforcing the imperial policies against third-world countries.
[2:16:00.280 --> 2:16:19.280]  And part of that was the military conquest of the Middle East that's going on right now. We are being used and abused by the forces of empire to do these things, and our country is pretty much going to be left in such a weakened condition that we pretty much have to do what we're told.
[2:16:19.280 --> 2:16:32.280]  Now, I do not believe that the plan has advanced as far as it was intended to by this time, and I think the reason for that is the resistance of the American people and their ability to learn about these things through the Internet.
[2:16:32.280 --> 2:16:48.280]  Yeah, I can't agree with you more than I feel like the United States is being set up as a sacrificial lamb, if you will, to take all the blame for all these woes from the wars in the Middle East, which are definitely for empire, but really the collapse of the economy as well.
[2:16:48.280 --> 2:17:08.280]  It's really about globalization. It's about bringing in a full North American Union so they can consolidate their power even further. And me and Alex were talking about this just yesterday, and I thought to myself, in this time period where they used to have bread lines, if this does go through, I feel like they have so many people trained with a card.
[2:17:08.280 --> 2:17:22.280]  You know, you'll get your government issued card, all the supermarkets that have gone out of business will be government run, you'll get your rations there, you'll swipe your card and you'll be given whatever they feel like they can give you and you'll be on your way.
[2:17:22.280 --> 2:17:29.280]  And Lord knows how long this will actually take place in our country before we ever recover if we recover.
[2:17:29.280 --> 2:17:44.280]  Well, that seems to be the trend, but there's one area that I think we need to look at a little bit differently. We say that all of these things are what the government is going to do, or what the government is going to do to us.
[2:17:44.280 --> 2:17:54.280]  But I think that we have to remember that the government really works for the financial powers and the corporate elite.
[2:17:54.280 --> 2:18:10.280]  I worked for the government for 32 years, and we had quite a bit of pride in what we did, and the people who actually work down in the agencies are very patriotic, and we all did our best to be efficient, to be accountable.
[2:18:10.280 --> 2:18:33.280]  But really, when the government is run by the corporations and by the financiers, as you see, for example, on the division of the airwaves, among only a very small handful of corporate giants who run all the television networks, what really has happened has been the privatization of public assets.
[2:18:33.280 --> 2:18:50.280]  This goes back, of course, to the Carter administration, really, when I was in the Carter White House, but it really began under the Reagan administration, and they did it in imitation of what was going on in Great Britain at that time, because that was when Margaret Thatcher was the prime minister.
[2:18:50.280 --> 2:19:02.280]  And I like to call Margaret Thatcher the queen of privatization, and she was really the mentor of Ronald Reagan in how to turn an economy over to the private financiers.
[2:19:02.280 --> 2:19:15.280]  So what we have today is the stealing of government by private interests, and it all goes back the way I've traced it in my research, to the first major privatization.
[2:19:15.280 --> 2:19:28.280]  That took place in 1913 when the Federal Reserve System was set up to run the currency of the United States by a cartel of private banks, not even US banks.
[2:19:28.280 --> 2:19:38.280]  Yeah, it is a private firm. The Federal Reserve is anything but federal. We're going to be back. It is the Alex Jones Show. We're speaking with Richard C. Cook, former analyst for the US Treasury Department.

[2:20:47.280 --> 2:21:07.280]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA? That's right. Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986, yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[2:21:07.280 --> 2:21:21.280]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs. Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[2:21:21.280 --> 2:21:31.280]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[2:21:31.280 --> 2:21:45.280]  Call 800-686-2237. Make sure that you secure your future. Call 800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.
[2:22:03.280 --> 2:22:16.280]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:22:16.280 --> 2:22:25.280]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[2:22:25.280 --> 2:22:33.280]  Littleberg is making great progress toward a world government. Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their affidavit.

[2:23:50.280 --> 2:24:02.280]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:24:02.280 --> 2:24:10.280]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back. I'm Jason Bermas. I'm going to be subbing in for Alex for the rest of the week as he goes out to Bilderberg in Chantilly, Virginia.
[2:24:10.280 --> 2:24:23.280]  We're going to be having live updates from there tomorrow, the next day, Friday. It's exciting stuff. Right now, we have Richard Cook, a former analyst for the U.S. Treasury Department.
[2:24:23.280 --> 2:24:35.280]  You were talking about how it's really an elite faction that rule. It's not really our government. They pull the strings. They're the ones that control the Federal Reserve Banking System, which is anything but federal.
[2:24:35.280 --> 2:24:47.280]  They're able to give us a fiat currency and in return really consolidate on hard assets. Do you feel like even today we're in a soft fascism?
[2:24:47.280 --> 2:25:05.280]  Well, we are. And the phrase that I'm encouraging people to remember when they ask themselves, well, who is this? Who's doing all this? The phrase that I use increasingly now is the Anglo-American Empire.
[2:25:05.280 --> 2:25:24.280]  And the best resources on this, at least from years ago, are books by Professor Carol Quigley, who was the mentor and professor of Bill Clinton when Clinton was a student at Georgetown University.
[2:25:24.280 --> 2:25:40.280]  Quigley wrote a couple of very authoritative books. One was called The Anglo-American Establishment, and another was called Tragedy and Hope. The latter is a very thick book, but you can get the essence of it from The Anglo-American Establishment.
[2:25:40.280 --> 2:25:55.280]  And one thing that Quigley points out, and he actually documents this in that book, is if you go back to the late 1800s and look at the people who were active in creating the kind of intellectual framework for the Anglo-American Establishment,
[2:25:55.280 --> 2:26:16.280]  it was people like Cecil Rhodes, a South African industrialist, who was financed in what he was doing by the Rothschilds, and they created various institutions such as the Round Table, and out of that came the Royal Institute, the Tavistock Institute, and others like that.
[2:26:16.280 --> 2:26:28.280]  But Cecil Rhodes said, in one of the wills he wrote, and he was always writing wills because he had these premonitions he was going to die at an early age, which he did, but he wrote in one of his wills, and I quote this in one of my recent articles,
[2:26:28.280 --> 2:26:46.280]  that one of the objectives of the people planning the empire were to recover the United States. Think about that. That's a very interesting word that they used, and that was the exact word that they used, recover the United States for the empire.
[2:26:46.280 --> 2:27:04.280]  This has been an objective and a plan of the British Empire for a long time. This is what they have tried to do, and this is what in large measure they have done. The big coup took place in 1913 when the Federal Reserve System was created,
[2:27:04.280 --> 2:27:19.280]  because it was through the Federal Reserve System that the Anglo American Empire took over the monetary system of the United States. They then were able to get the United States into World War I to defeat Germany.
[2:27:19.280 --> 2:27:29.280]  They were then able to use the United States in World War II to defeat their enemies, and now they're trying to do the same thing by drawing us into the next World War.
[2:27:29.280 --> 2:27:39.280]  The next World War that they are trying to instigate would be between the United States and Russia and China on the side of Russia. This is what is being set up.
[2:27:39.280 --> 2:27:48.280]  Now, I say that we should go back to the arrangement we had with Russia back in the 19th century, the 1800s. We were an ally of Russia.
[2:27:48.280 --> 2:28:03.280]  Russia sold us Alaska. The Russian Navy came to New York and San Francisco harbors to protect us from attacks by the British fleet. Russia is a continental land power, and Russia has overthrown its communist government.
[2:28:03.280 --> 2:28:12.280]  People say today, well, Russia is still communist, but that's not true. Russia is a democracy, and it's becoming increasingly spiritual with the resurgence of the Orthodox Church.
[2:28:12.280 --> 2:28:28.280]  Russia is a Christian nation, just as we have been in our past, and we need to look to Russia as our friend instead of our enemy, but we are being drawn into a World War against Russia, and the more people become aware of this, I think, the better off we are, because we need to stop that.
[2:28:28.280 --> 2:28:39.280]  Going back to what you said about Quigley, Quigley was also the mentor of Bill Clinton, and he was mentioned a couple of times, I believe in the State of the Union address, and his initial inception as president.
[2:28:39.280 --> 2:28:54.280]  In that book, Tragedy and Hope, he discusses how he was able to look over secret documents of this round table group that Rhodes had set up, and Rhodes also set up things like the Rhodes Scholarship so that they could pick the very best and the brightest to work for them.
[2:28:54.280 --> 2:29:09.280]  So this is something that's absolutely true, and this has been around for quite some time, so the elite not only pools their resources together, in other words, meets in secret, does things behind any kind of government power such as these Bilderberg meetings,
[2:29:09.280 --> 2:29:38.280]  but then they also recruit the best and the brightest under seemingly legitimate circumstances. We're going to be back with Richard C. Cook, a former analyst for the U.S. Treasury Department. After this, it's the Alex Jones Show, Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.

[2:33:28.280 --> 2:33:40.280]  All right, it's the Alex Jones show. We're back. I'm Jason Bermas. I am in for Alex for the rest of the week. I want to thank all the listeners out there that donated into the money bomb over the weekend on Saturday night.
[2:33:40.280 --> 2:33:50.280]  The little marathon show, I think he did like four or five hours. It was pretty unbelievable till about 1 a.m. We raised over $200,000. We're still waiting for some checks to come in.
[2:33:50.280 --> 2:34:05.280]  We're leaving it open until Friday when we will let you know what the grand total is so that we can bring this operation up a notch and start a television network because I got to tell you folks, the mainstream media is not going to tell you the kind of information that's just been discussed on this show.
[2:34:05.280 --> 2:34:26.280]  With a credible individual, I mean, this person has been in government for over 30 years. He worked for NASA extensively. He worked for the Treasury Department. He's telling you that your money is a fiat currency and it is going to be devalued to a point that we not only have a recession but probably another depression in this country that could reshape our entire way of life.
[2:34:26.280 --> 2:34:29.280]  Richard, where can people check your material out?
[2:34:29.280 --> 2:34:48.280]  Jason, let me just go over a couple of sites people can take a look at. My personal website, which features my Challenger book, is www.RichardSeacook.com. Richard Seacook was a C for my middle initial.
[2:34:48.280 --> 2:35:02.280]  Now my partner that I'm working with at this time, her name is Susan Boske. She's out in Washington State. Susan and I are setting up a new website. It's called realsustainableliving.com.
[2:35:02.280 --> 2:35:10.280]  We'll probably be bringing that up within the next few weeks and that's going to feature our economic and monetary writings.
[2:35:10.280 --> 2:35:28.280]  Most of my articles at this time are on the global research website, so people can check those out. My more recent articles are also on rents.com and most of my articles are on the Arizona Free Press website, so all of those are sources that people can check out.
[2:35:28.280 --> 2:35:50.280]  Now, if anyone would like to write into us with questions to get on Susan's and my mailing list or if they want to find out how they can participate in the work that we're trying to do and support it, we've got a new email for that and that's economicsanityatgmail.com.
[2:35:50.280 --> 2:36:08.280]  Well, thanks for giving out that kind of information. I encourage people to go check this stuff out because we can't really cover it all here. I find that the best tools to wake people up, unfortunately, are just a few of the patriot videos that we have on these subjects, such as Money Masters, which is a three-hour documentary,
[2:36:08.280 --> 2:36:22.280]  really breaks down how the Federal Reserve was started, brought into law, how we were kind of lulled into it, how it's not federal at all, and then America Freedom to Fascism, which goes into the IRS, the Real ID Act, and then even the Verichip at the end.
[2:36:22.280 --> 2:36:45.280]  People don't seem to read as much anymore. They don't seem to be as active anymore. I really feel like we're in this consumerist culture where people are really concerned about maybe paying their mortgage or their car payment and maybe putting their kids through school, but they're really not in touch with the reality of our political situation right now, Richard.
[2:36:45.280 --> 2:36:59.280]  Well, that's very true, and the videos that are out there are very effective. In fact, I just saw the other day that Alex and you have put up a couple of videos of my appearances on the radio show.
[2:36:59.280 --> 2:37:20.280]  There are two YouTube videos of my being interviewed by Alex that I think are great, very effective tools, but you're absolutely right. And if I could go over, really, some of my thoughts about what people can be doing at this time, it might be useful because I'm constantly getting emails from people who've read my article saying,
[2:37:20.280 --> 2:37:31.280]  Well, what can I do? What steps can I take? And there are things I think that people can and should and must do right now to really to save our country.
[2:37:31.280 --> 2:37:46.280]  The first of these, of course, is to get educated. As I said before, I think the reason that things are not worse than they are today is because of the internet, because of the ability we have to go to the internet.
[2:37:46.280 --> 2:37:55.280]  Of course, you've got to sift through a lot of different things, but there is information there that you will never get through the mainstream media, so people have got to do that.
[2:37:55.280 --> 2:38:08.280]  And anyone who really wants to understand events today has to sit down and go through the internet just about every day because there's constantly new material coming up, and it's up to us to piece that together.
[2:38:08.280 --> 2:38:22.280]  Nobody's going to sit down. A lot of us try to do that to piece it together, but every person has got to come to their own understanding and their own formulation of what's really happening, and you can do that if you dig and search hard enough.
[2:38:22.280 --> 2:38:32.280]  Another thing I think people have to really remember is don't lose your faith. Don't lose your spiritual approach to life.
[2:38:32.280 --> 2:38:43.280]  These things happen for a purpose. We're in a purposeful universe. The people who are trying to attack our country want us to think everything is just chaotic.
[2:38:43.280 --> 2:38:56.280]  There's no sense or purpose to anything. The only world that exists is the material world. The only way to safety is to make more money or spend more or go more into debt.
[2:38:56.280 --> 2:39:03.280]  All of that is wrong. The real values are within us, and that's where we really have to search and keep our faith.
[2:39:03.280 --> 2:39:10.280]  And if we do that, we'll have a much better attitude, I think, toward the future, because I have an optimistic attitude toward the future.
[2:39:10.280 --> 2:39:16.280]  I have a lot of faith in people and our ability to do the right thing.
[2:39:16.280 --> 2:39:37.280]  One of the things we have to do is to get healthy physically, to be healthy, to adopt healthy attitudes, healthy lifestyles, because one of the big ways that they have of living off of us as parasites is through the huge quantity of drugs and medication that people take.
[2:39:37.280 --> 2:39:49.280]  I mean, it's unbelievable how many people are on different kinds of medication. Well, they've all been brainwashed into believing that they're sick, and they see these commercials where you've got to take this pill or that pill.
[2:39:49.280 --> 2:40:00.280]  They give a range of just about every single thing, and then the side effects are so minimized when, in fact, you're taking a pill that's probably going to give you bad diarrhea, heart problems, and headaches.
[2:40:00.280 --> 2:40:10.280]  Yeah, and also, Jason, people really don't have enough appreciation of just how big the illegal drug problem is.
[2:40:10.280 --> 2:40:17.280]  I mean, the war on drugs that the federal government has supposedly been running is a joke.
[2:40:17.280 --> 2:40:28.280]  Governments and banking systems and big banks are deeply, deeply involved in the worldwide illicit and illegal drug trade.
[2:40:28.280 --> 2:40:39.280]  It's an enormous drain of resources, and the bankers and the money launders who work through the bankers get rich off of these things, and so people should avoid these like the plague.
[2:40:39.280 --> 2:40:52.280]  I would even say after that they incarcerate those who use them and then put them in their privatized prisons to pay them $0.39 an hour so that they can be a telecommunications guy working for Sprint trying to get you to change your long-distance service.
[2:40:52.280 --> 2:41:08.280]  Well, as we know, the United States has the biggest prison population on the planet, and I don't know the numbers, but I do know that a very large proportion of those are in there for drug-related offenses,
[2:41:08.280 --> 2:41:14.280]  and a lot of these people are drawing into it because they can't get jobs, you know? They don't have an income. They've got to do something.
[2:41:14.280 --> 2:41:31.280]  I met somebody recently. I used to live in Michigan, and Michigan once was one of our most highly industrialized states. Tremendous knowledge and skill in Michigan from the auto industry and industries related to that.
[2:41:31.280 --> 2:41:44.280]  That industry is gone, and I talked to somebody from one of the cities in the southern part of Michigan, not that far from Detroit, and I said, well, what's the impact of the loss of our industry on your city?
[2:41:44.280 --> 2:41:56.280]  And this man, a young man in his 20s, said to me, well, you know what they're doing in that city in Michigan now? They're setting up illegal methamphetamine labs because that's what they're producing now.
[2:41:56.280 --> 2:42:01.280]  That's what they're living off of. This is a disaster.
[2:42:01.280 --> 2:42:12.280]  Absolutely, and they're going to keep promoting their drugs on television in order for companies like Pfizer and other big pharma corporations to make billions and billions of dollars.
[2:42:12.280 --> 2:42:28.280]  They're going to have their kick and eat at two by illegally running the drugs in this country in black ops programs, making billions and billions of dollars, and then they're going to send hundreds of thousands of people to prison every year to work for slave labor wages under their corporations.
[2:42:28.280 --> 2:42:34.280]  It's a really nice scam they have running on the American people, and really the people of the world in general.
[2:42:34.280 --> 2:42:46.280]  I mean, look at Afghanistan. We go into Afghanistan. I'm not supporting the Taliban, but they had cut down the opium production by leaps and bounds in that country. We go in, and now 95% of the opium in the world comes out of there.
[2:42:46.280 --> 2:42:48.280]  I wonder why that is.
[2:42:48.280 --> 2:43:00.280]  Well, we know why, and one reason is that it's used as a weapon by the covert operatives against the Central Asian republics and against Russia.
[2:43:00.280 --> 2:43:17.280]  It's the same thing that the British Empire did to China back in the 19th century. It's to go in by force to get everyone addicted to drugs and then make a fortune by selling them the drugs and also keep them in their place by assuring that they're going to be in a drug-induced stupor.
[2:43:17.280 --> 2:43:26.280]  This is a covert warfare measure that has been taken against the countries of Central Asia and of Russia as well as China.
[2:43:26.280 --> 2:43:39.280]  Have you seen the film America Drug War yet? We're carrying it over at infowars.com. It's Kevin Booth's new film, and it really goes through not only government involvement in the drugs, but the crack boom in the 90s.
[2:43:39.280 --> 2:43:51.280]  Just a bunch of great stuff. Again, Kevin Booth put this together. It's done the circuit around the film awards, and I believe they had it on Showtime something like 50 times. Have you seen this movie yet?
[2:43:51.280 --> 2:44:05.280]  No, I haven't. It sounds like something I'd really like to see. People should also bear in mind that the CIA itself is admitted in its internal reports that its people have been involved in the illicit drug trade. It's not something that people have just made up.
[2:44:05.280 --> 2:44:24.280]  Yeah, absolutely, and some of that actually came out during the Iran-Contra hearings. There's a whole scandal in Mina, Arkansas. This movie features Selly Castillo, who actually helped them move the drugs, tried to blow the whistle. There's pictures of Selly on literally tons of cocaine in brick fashion in a military garb with guns.
[2:44:24.280 --> 2:44:40.280]  It's ludicrous to think that our government hasn't been involved in this. Whenever they declare war on something, folks, that isn't a nation, you should be very, very, very, very suspect. The war on terror, the war on drugs, the war on poverty.
[2:44:40.280 --> 2:44:44.280]  Well, whenever they do this, it seems like all those situations just get worse.
[2:44:44.280 --> 2:45:01.280]  I have read, and I don't have the data to confirm it, but I think it's likely plausible, that the illicit and illegal drug industry is the largest industry in the world in terms of total value of the product.
[2:45:01.280 --> 2:45:10.280]  And this could not be the case if it were not one of the industries of the largest empire in the world, and that's the Anglo-American Empire.
[2:45:10.280 --> 2:45:26.280]  I'm with you there, and they love nothing more than to pull you over, find a little bit of marijuana, give you a huge ticket or maybe even a court date, put you into the system, have you on record, and then suck funds out of you.
[2:45:26.280 --> 2:45:38.280]  For what? For something that's been decriminalized now in a couple states in this country, yet the federal government still feels it needs to go into these shops in California and raid them and accuse them of being drug dealers.
[2:45:38.280 --> 2:45:49.280]  Yeah, and this is why, with the point I want to make to our listeners here, much of what a person can do has to do with what to avoid.
[2:45:49.280 --> 2:46:00.280]  I mean, we should be avoiding illegal drugs, and to the extent that we're able to, prescription medication, like the plague, for health reasons, for financial reasons, for legal reasons.
[2:46:00.280 --> 2:46:08.280]  But I think we'd be remiss if we didn't also mention another very critical thing that people can do for themselves.
[2:46:08.280 --> 2:46:16.280]  It's something everybody says it's hard to do. I mean, you two turn on the cable TV and Susie Orman will tell you this, get out of debt.
[2:46:16.280 --> 2:46:23.280]  If you have debts, try to pay them down. If you can't pay them down, try to negotiate with your creditors.
[2:46:23.280 --> 2:46:32.280]  There are books out there that tell you how to do this, and it can be very effective. Don't go into debt. Do anything possible other than sign a debt instrument.
[2:46:32.280 --> 2:46:45.280]  I mean, buy a used car. Learn how to fix it. Do your maintenance. There's so many things people can do to avoid getting out their credit card or to avoid putting your name on the dotted line to pay a debt.
[2:46:45.280 --> 2:46:56.280]  When you don't know if in the future you're going to be able to, particularly if you're not rich to start with, and if you were rich to start with, you wouldn't need to go into debt.
[2:46:56.280 --> 2:47:07.280]  So this is another thing that I emphasize with people. Get out of debt. Don't go into new debt. And I've even advocated, and we may have something, Susan and I may have something coming out on this shortly,
[2:47:07.280 --> 2:47:20.280]  the formation of a National Debtors Union where people can work together to hire our own lobbyists to go to Washington and try to get Congress to pass a more liberal bankruptcy law, for instance,
[2:47:20.280 --> 2:47:38.280]  or to pass anti-usery laws to prevent banks and credit card companies from sucking the blood out of consumers by these incredibly high penalties, by being able to raise your interest rates without notification,
[2:47:38.280 --> 2:47:51.280]  a whole range of actions that we should be able to take collectively to make our voices known because there are a lot more people in debt out there than there are ones who the money is owed to.
[2:47:51.280 --> 2:48:07.280]  Well, again, we live in this consumerist culture of the credit card where it's as easy as swiping a piece of plastic and all your dreams come true and we're constantly bombarded with these new widgets and gadgets that we just have to have from the iPhone to satellite radio
[2:48:07.280 --> 2:48:18.280]  to just about anything else that's been customized to brainwash into thinking, me, me, me, me, I need this now, now, now, now, now, and people don't realize they're putting themselves into thousands of dollars of debt.
[2:48:18.280 --> 2:48:22.280]  Well, a library card's a good substitute for a lot of things.
[2:48:22.280 --> 2:48:38.280]  Yeah, but how many people read anymore? It's tragic in this country, but the mainstream media is dead, people aren't reading the paper anymore, people are going to the internet most of the time, and I think that's why YouTube is so important.
[2:48:38.280 --> 2:48:42.280]  Like you said, your interviews with Alex on real economic issues are out there and tens of thousands of people are watching them.
[2:48:42.280 --> 2:48:54.280]  You know, we're creating a new media and I hope it's not too late to wake people up before their homes are foreclosed on and they literally lose the very way of life they thought they were protecting by buying into this system.
[2:48:54.280 --> 2:49:12.280]  Yeah, I agree. Now, there's one other thing I want to mention also because I've talked to a lot of people lately. I was interviewed last night by or yesterday afternoon by Kevin Barrett who's running for Congress in Wisconsin.
[2:49:12.280 --> 2:49:30.280]  I'm organizing a congressional candidate in Massachusetts named Harold Burbank, who's very aware of all of these issues. I've got a meeting coming up this weekend with Darrell Castle, who is the candidate for vice president for the Constitution Party.
[2:49:30.280 --> 2:49:46.280]  People can and should be involved in the political process. Cindy Sheehan, who I met a couple weeks ago at this conference I was at in Radford, Virginia, is running for Congress in San Francisco against Nancy Pelosi.
[2:49:46.280 --> 2:50:00.280]  And she's going to win. She's going to win. I think she's going to win, man. And that's what we need to do. I tell this to people everywhere I go, everywhere I speak, yes, the federal government right now is corrupt to its core. That doesn't mean that you can't become a town council member.
[2:50:00.280 --> 2:50:12.280]  That doesn't mean that you can't run for state senate and win. That doesn't mean that you can't become entrenched in local government and ward these federal programs off like the Real ID Act and others.
[2:50:12.280 --> 2:50:17.280]  The website is RichardSeacook.com. In closing, is there anything you want to leave the listeners with?
[2:50:17.280 --> 2:50:35.280]  Well, I want to just very briefly mention Ron Paul. He has done a tremendous service for our political process by calling for the abolishment of the Federal Reserve. As far as I know, he is the first presidential candidate who's ever done that.
[2:50:35.280 --> 2:50:48.280]  And I want to tell people, as a former veteran of the Treasury Department, he's right. It can and should be abolished as a bank of issue. And there's a growing monetary reform movement now in the...
[2:50:48.280 --> 2:51:01.280]  Imagine walking down the street and hearing footsteps behind you. They get closer and closer, and suddenly you have a sense something bad is going to happen. What are you going to do to defend yourself?
[2:51:01.280 --> 2:51:14.280]  TebowTech specializes in non-lethal self-defense products for you and your family. With everything from stun guns and tasers to personal alarms and pepper spray, TebowTech will arm you with the most advanced non-lethal products anywhere on the net.

[2:52:50.280 --> 2:53:12.280]  Once America was led by real politicians, now politicians in the U.S., city, county, state and federal are owned and controlled by corporations. We have corporate representatives instead of politicians. Criminal corporate manipulation has caused grain prices to soar to the highest levels in history.

[2:53:44.280 --> 2:53:57.280]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:53:57.280 --> 2:54:20.280]  All right, folks, we're back at the Alex Jones show on Jason Bermesson. We'll be subbing in the rest of the week. Richard Cook got cut off talking about Ron Paul, who I think has done a tremendous job in waking up what's left of the mainstream watching politics to the fact that the Federal Reserve is anything but federal, to the fact that the IRS needs to go, to the fact that we have to get back to a hard currency.
[2:54:20.280 --> 2:54:31.280]  Its precious metals have retained their value throughout history, and we no longer have a gold backing on the dollar, folks. On top of that, after Richard leaves us in this hour, we're going to have Jim Checker in the next hour.
[2:54:31.280 --> 2:54:42.280]  And I want to let everybody know that Rosie O'Donnell actually called into the Howard Stern Show today for some other reason. I guess they were bashing her, but she brought up Building 7. She brought up Willie Rodriguez.
[2:54:42.280 --> 2:54:53.280]  We're going to try to play the clip before we go from the show today. I have to make sure there's no dirty language because, again, it is on serious satellite radio, and Stern is notorious for dropping the F-bomb.
[2:54:53.280 --> 2:55:05.280]  Getting back to Ron Paul, he really has, I think, rejuvenated the Patriot movement and brought a lot of us together, and brought in a lot of people who had no idea about any of these issues at all, Richard.
[2:55:05.280 --> 2:55:16.280]  And I've got to applaud him for that, and I hope that he continues to do so. I hope that he maintains a seat in Congress, and that he continues to be a very reverent voice in this movement.
[2:55:16.280 --> 2:55:26.280]  Well, they say they're going to have a presence at the Republican National Convention, and I certainly hope they do that because, as you know, Ron Paul is still an active candidate,
[2:55:26.280 --> 2:55:44.280]  but he has said that he is now working for the future, and perhaps if the Republican Party does get what it deserves this fall and completely collapses as a force, maybe then Ron Paul and his people can step in and rejuvenate it.
[2:55:44.280 --> 2:55:56.280]  Well, I'm with you there. How does he do that, though? I've talked to a lot of people about the convention. Obviously, I hope that there's protests at both of these conventions, both the Democratic and the Republican convention.
[2:55:56.280 --> 2:56:16.280]  I've seen some work out there to try to provocateur events out in Denver in August, where the DNC is being held. There's actually a group out there called Recreate 68 that's trying to recruit people to come and protest this event, but not do so in a peaceful manner like our listeners would,
[2:56:16.280 --> 2:56:30.280]  and tape what's going on, ask reasonable questions, basically use your first amendment. They want these people to dress up in masks, bring shields, bring red paints, and destroy cameras. Sounds like a provocatory event to me. What do you think?
[2:56:30.280 --> 2:56:43.280]  Oh, yeah, it is. And really, the Democratic convention is going to be the biggest love fest we've ever seen, and I think the only question is how many red, white, and blue balloons will be falling from the ceiling?
[2:56:43.280 --> 2:56:59.280]  Well, I got to tell you, for my latest documentary that I've been putting together, I watched the 2004 RNC convention, and it was such a cult-like experience of just discussed again and again and again as I watched this thing.
[2:56:59.280 --> 2:57:24.280]  I couldn't believe it. I can't believe how these people are so brainwashed, how they can get behind a candidate just because they have an elephant on their shirt or a donkey on their shirt, because they say the same rhetoric. I have not heard really one candidate out of both parties other than Ron Paul discuss real issues, not only real issues, but mean what they say, not just trying to get elected.
[2:57:24.280 --> 2:57:38.280]  We had a few mentions of some issues back in the early days of the Democratic debates when we still had people like Biden and Christod and Dennis Kasinich and Mike Gravel on the stage, but they got rid of those pretty quickly, didn't they?
[2:57:38.280 --> 2:57:54.280]  Yeah, and I would definitely agree with the last two there. Gravel and Kasinich have brought some real issues to the table. Kasinich continues to try to pursue a new 9-11 investigation. Gravel supports a new 9-11 investigation. They're both against the war.
[2:57:54.280 --> 2:58:07.280]  You know, Joe Biden, I want to like Joe Biden. Joe Biden's one of the few politicians that seems to be in the know in battling this stuff, but I just don't trust him. RichardSeacook.com is the website. We thank you so much for joining us, Richard.
[2:58:07.280 --> 2:58:20.280]  Thank you, Jason. Thank you and say hi to Alex for me. I definitely will. He's out in Bilderberg, folks. We're going to be having reports for the rest of the week. Infowars.com and PrismPlan.com are the sites. We're going to come back and try to play that Rosie O'Donnell clip. Jim Tucker in the next hour.
[2:58:37.280 --> 2:58:48.280]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope. The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[2:58:48.280 --> 2:58:58.280]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan. We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:58:58.280 --> 2:59:14.280]  In the Infowar, PrismPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom. PrismPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[2:59:59.280 --> 3:00:14.280]  Alright folks, we are live and we're streaming video too over at PrismPlanet.tv. Fourth hour, big hour. We're going to have Jim Tucker on. For those watching me on the television, I am a little burnt up. I caught some sun going out to San Antonio yesterday.
[3:00:14.280 --> 3:00:24.280]  Man, the heat here is brutal in Texas. Don't let them tell you any different. I'm burned up. Oh man, I'm looking myself on the camera. I got like a big red nose and red blotches everywhere. What can you do?
[3:00:24.280 --> 3:00:38.280]  Alright, so I've listened to the clip and as far as I can tell, there are no curse words. Rosie called in to Howard Stern. She commended him for going after the FCC and criticizing the Bush administration said that she was very inspired by that.
[3:00:38.280 --> 3:00:46.280]  However, Howard dropped an F bomb, so we had to skip over that part. But here we go. Here she starts to get into the World Trade Center.
[3:00:46.280 --> 3:00:56.280]  What's going on with you in 9-11? You're one of those people that believes that there was a conspiracy. I do not believe the official story. It defies the laws of physics.
[3:00:56.280 --> 3:01:01.280]  That's what Jesse Ventura said. How much of a physicist are you though?
[3:01:01.280 --> 3:01:17.280]  Well, like everyone else, I was in New York like you all were. It was probably the most defining moment of my adult life and I researched it like everyone else. I watched Building 7 come down the way we watched all those old hotels in Vegas be demolished.
[3:01:17.280 --> 3:01:34.280]  It defies the laws of physics. If you throw a billiard ball off the top of the World Trade Center, it would hit the bottom in 10 seconds. Those buildings fell at freefall speed with no resistance. The only way to do that with 47 steel girders in the middle is through explosive devices.
[3:01:34.280 --> 3:01:49.280]  To me, it is something like the Kennedy assassination. There are some people that say, what do you think? Do you think that it was Lee Harvey Oswald? I do. I actually do. I do believe he acted alone. I asked Arlen Specter about it. It makes sense to me.
[3:01:49.280 --> 3:02:04.280]  All right. We're going to stop it right there because I didn't listen beyond that point. Arlen Specter was good enough to come on Stern, one of the cover up guys over at the Warren Commission. Stern believes him because he's a nice guy and he came on.
[3:02:04.280 --> 3:02:19.280]  I've seen Arlen Specter talk. He can be pleasant. He admitted that it looks like the anthrax attacks were indeed from an inside source. He's the one that shared the hearings regarding able danger. He was one of the few guys that showed up.
[3:02:19.280 --> 3:02:33.280]  Biden was another one. We just mentioned Biden, so I thought I'd give Joey B a little plug there as well. But there it is. Howard still wants to cling on to the fact that Oswald acted alone. He doesn't want to look into 9-11.
[3:02:33.280 --> 3:02:48.280]  Now, Rosie O'Donnell, big ups. Way to keep it on. Way not to back down. Way not to avoid the question. You and Jesse Ventura are tops of my list. I mean, Ventura is on another level because he was the governor and he's just fearless. He commands respect.
[3:02:48.280 --> 3:03:04.280]  Alex Navy Seal, big guy, celebrity, can bring more people in. But Rosie O'Donnell did it first. Way to stick to your guns, Rosie. I'm sure we're going to post a story about that on infowars.com, prismplanet.com. I think we're actually the first to have the MP3.
[3:03:04.280 --> 3:03:19.280]  So we'll see what happens. I'm going to listen to the rest of that in a break. Check it out. Remember, Jim Tucker is going to be on momentarily, and Alex Jones and crew have left to go to the Big Builderburg Conference. Again, not since 2002, has it been in Chantilly, Virginia?
[3:03:19.280 --> 3:03:43.280]  This seems like a bit of a stakeout. It looks like it's pretty well secluded. There's a little bit of video of what the hotel entrance looks like, where it's located in DC. But what's worrying me most about this Builderburg meeting is that it's going to be awful easy for these guys to bring in other military officials, other insiders in Washington who wouldn't normally go to the meeting.
[3:03:43.280 --> 3:03:55.280]  What do I mean by that? Well, this is a weekend retreat. This is not the two-week resort in Bohemian Grove where there's members and then there's guests, and some people are flown in for a couple days with meetings with specific people.
[3:03:55.280 --> 3:04:08.280]  The Builderburg group is notorious for having a revolving list. For instance, when John Edwards was made to be the vice presidential nominee, he went to Builderburg.
[3:04:08.280 --> 3:04:19.280]  He doesn't go to Builderburg every year. He's been to Builderburg, I think, once since, but perhaps he'll be showing up for this next Builderburg. It's my suspicion that he will be the vice presidential nominee.
[3:04:19.280 --> 3:04:27.280]  But they're going to be able to bring in all sorts of generals, diplomats, and work out kind of side programs. Not everybody's in on everything, folks.
[3:04:27.280 --> 3:04:45.280]  So we're going to be back. We're going to be talking with Jim Tucker about these subjects in Builderburg, infowars.com, prismplanet.com, and remember, the stream's over at prismplanet.tv.
[3:04:45.280 --> 3:04:59.280]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[3:04:59.280 --> 3:05:16.280]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus. The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[3:05:16.280 --> 3:05:30.280]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria. What about you? Order your KDF shower filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[3:05:45.280 --> 3:05:49.280]  It is a big idea. A New World Order.
[3:05:49.280 --> 3:05:54.280]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:05:54.280 --> 3:06:00.280]  It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[3:06:00.280 --> 3:06:11.280]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:06:11.280 --> 3:06:22.280]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[3:06:22.280 --> 3:06:25.280]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[3:06:25.280 --> 3:06:30.280]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their appetizer.

[3:07:44.280 --> 3:07:56.280]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[3:07:56.280 --> 3:08:05.280]  All right, folks, we're back. It's The Alex Jones Show. I'm Jason Bermas, studying in as Alex ventures off to the Bilderberg Conference in Chantilly, Virginia.
[3:08:05.280 --> 3:08:15.280]  And on the line is the pioneer journalist who has covered the Bilderberg Conference for longer than anybody else.
[3:08:15.280 --> 3:08:22.280]  We carry his book. He's done an amazing amount of work and research to expose these guys.
[3:08:22.280 --> 3:08:29.280]  He works for American Free Press. He's constantly writing real articles about real issues.
[3:08:29.280 --> 3:08:33.280]  His name is Jim Tucker. He's going to be meeting Alex Jones out there.
[3:08:33.280 --> 3:08:36.280]  Jim, it is a pleasure to talk to you.
[3:08:36.280 --> 3:08:38.280]  It's always fun, Alex.
[3:08:38.280 --> 3:08:44.280]  Now, you're down there right now. Have you gotten to the conference yet? Are you down in Chantilly?
[3:08:44.280 --> 3:08:47.280]  No, but I'll be there early tomorrow morning.
[3:08:47.280 --> 3:08:51.280]  So you'll be there tomorrow to meet Alex and the gang. Very, very, very exciting stuff.
[3:08:51.280 --> 3:08:57.280]  Now, I want to, before we discuss what you think is going to be on the table for this conference and who the attendees are,
[3:08:57.280 --> 3:09:03.280]  I want to flash back to 2002 when they held this conference in the same place.
[3:09:03.280 --> 3:09:08.280]  Now, as I understand it, this was the first Bilderberg meeting since 9-11 had occurred.
[3:09:08.280 --> 3:09:13.280]  And they made some pretty, or was it the second?
[3:09:13.280 --> 3:09:22.280]  Well, let's see. Yeah, 2002 was the first Bilderberg meeting after 9-11.
[3:09:22.280 --> 3:09:29.280]  And the time we thought that perhaps they picked Chantilly simply because it was convenient to Dulles Airport
[3:09:29.280 --> 3:09:31.280]  and they were worried about terrorist striking again.
[3:09:31.280 --> 3:09:38.280]  And we all were afraid of another 9-11-size attack at that time.
[3:09:38.280 --> 3:09:46.280]  And interestingly, at that meeting, it was the first time I've ever discerned a real split among Bilderberg.
[3:09:46.280 --> 3:09:53.280]  The American Bilderbergs opposed the upcoming invasion of Afghanistan and then, of course, Iraq.
[3:09:53.280 --> 3:09:58.280]  Most American Bilderbergs favored it.
[3:09:58.280 --> 3:10:10.280]  But to pacify the Europeans, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld trot Southland Pentagon on a Saturday to address Bilderberg,
[3:10:10.280 --> 3:10:20.280]  in his address, he promised there would be no invasion of Iraq or Afghanistan this year, being that year of 2002.
[3:10:20.280 --> 3:10:29.280]  But meanwhile, all the major newspapers, including the Washington Post and York Times, L.A. Times, all controlled by Bilderberg
[3:10:29.280 --> 3:10:35.280]  were saying that the invasion will come this year, late summer or early fall at the latest.
[3:10:35.280 --> 3:10:45.280]  Now, Jimmy Lee Hogan sent through that speech of the Washington Post, as did Donald Graham, the publisher of the Washington Post.
[3:10:45.280 --> 3:10:50.280]  The Post has been represented at Bilderberg meetings since they first invented themselves in 1954.
[3:10:50.280 --> 3:10:54.280]  And he heard that. He knew there would be no invasion.
[3:10:54.280 --> 3:11:00.280]  But their loyalty to speak nothing was so strong, he did not go back to his own newspapers.
[3:11:00.280 --> 3:11:06.280]  He stopped saying there would be an invasion this year because there will not be. He did not ask me how I know, but I'm the social editor.
[3:11:06.280 --> 3:11:13.280]  I do know. And Donald Graham, the publisher, could have said the same thing to the news staff, but no, they did not say a word about it.
[3:11:13.280 --> 3:11:17.280]  They let their own newspaper be wrong about it, along with the other newspapers.
[3:11:17.280 --> 3:11:29.280]  And of course, the New York Times and the L.A. Times and the Financial Times and so forth, they did not report on that speech either.
[3:11:29.280 --> 3:11:37.280]  They just let the newspapers continue to be wrong. That is very high devotion to their sworn duties to reveal nothing.
[3:11:37.280 --> 3:11:40.280]  And what do you think is going to be on the table this year?
[3:11:40.280 --> 3:11:44.280]  Are we going to be talking Iran? Are we going to be talking vice presidential candidates?
[3:11:44.280 --> 3:11:47.280]  I think that there's a reason that's in D.C. this year.
[3:11:47.280 --> 3:11:54.280]  I feel like it's going to be a lot easier for them to access Washington insiders, diplomats, military personnel,
[3:11:54.280 --> 3:12:00.280]  if they only want them to sit in on a half an hour or an hour-long meeting instead of taking part in the entire conference.
[3:12:00.280 --> 3:12:07.280]  Well, yes, it does make it easy for our bureaucrats to duck over.
[3:12:07.280 --> 3:12:14.280]  For example, President of the United States has never attended Bill Clinton, except Bill Clinton did the year before he was elected.
[3:12:14.280 --> 3:12:19.280]  His obscure governor, Arkansas in 1991, 1992, is elected president.
[3:12:19.280 --> 3:12:27.280]  But as president, none have dared to attend because every White House reporter is given his daily schedule.
[3:12:27.280 --> 3:12:33.280]  Every day, size of a paperback Western novel, counting for every minute of his time.
[3:12:33.280 --> 3:12:41.280]  And there's no way he could lock out even three hours in the middle of the day or evening and call it private time and get away with it.
[3:12:41.280 --> 3:12:44.280]  So they don't go. But bureaucrats can.
[3:12:44.280 --> 3:12:51.280]  Of course, Rummy can roll over on Saturday. There's not much precedent to have gone on Saturday.
[3:12:51.280 --> 3:12:59.280]  On most Saturdays, rather obscurely, does have to count for a couple of hours of his time on a Saturday morning.
[3:12:59.280 --> 3:13:01.280]  And he did make that promise. You're right.
[3:13:01.280 --> 3:13:06.280]  It is easier for bureaucrats to duck in their marching orders when they're meeting in Washington.
[3:13:06.280 --> 3:13:18.280]  Although, wherever they meet, they have high officials of the Treasury Department, State Department, Defense Department, and officials of the White House attending to get their orders.
[3:13:18.280 --> 3:13:20.280]  But it does make it more convenient.
[3:13:20.280 --> 3:13:24.280]  Now, in the past few years, there's been a little bit more light shed on Bilderberg.
[3:13:24.280 --> 3:13:31.280]  Daniel Estelans wrote his book, some mainstream media's in the Netherlands and even in Canada have now reported on it.
[3:13:31.280 --> 3:13:36.280]  Do you expect some sort of a turnout by any sort of mainstream journalist?
[3:13:36.280 --> 3:13:44.280]  Or do you think it's going to be you, Alex, and a couple, you know, rogue journalists who are not part of the mainstream?
[3:13:44.280 --> 3:13:55.280]  You probably summarized it pretty well because, as I mentioned before, in Europe, we have heavy collaboration with broadcasters and newspapers.
[3:13:55.280 --> 3:14:05.280]  But they're a limited budget. They have a lot of newspapers, but that competition means that there's not all that advertising revenue for any one newspaper.
[3:14:05.280 --> 3:14:09.280]  So they simply can't afford to send reporters across the pond.
[3:14:09.280 --> 3:14:15.280]  If they're on the continent, they'll have their reporters drive 800 miles or take a train.
[3:14:15.280 --> 3:14:23.280]  But they just don't send them, many of them, to...
[3:14:23.280 --> 3:14:30.280]  So what you're saying is the international press is probably going to have to rely on the information that you yourself get out of Bilderberg, correct?
[3:14:30.280 --> 3:14:36.280]  Yes, but they'll help back too, because when their guys get home, they'll torture them a bit.
[3:14:36.280 --> 3:14:38.280]  Sometimes some information escapes.
[3:14:38.280 --> 3:14:39.280]  Gotcha.
[3:14:39.280 --> 3:14:43.280]  And then they feed that to us and we confirm and go with it.
[3:14:43.280 --> 3:14:47.280]  Now, have you gotten a list of who's going to be attending yet?
[3:14:47.280 --> 3:14:57.280]  No, and they're going to try hard not to provide a list. They're still hoping that there'll be no attention, that the meeting will be completely unreported.
[3:14:57.280 --> 3:15:09.280]  Now, in the past, when they say no list, never, ever, and they've realized, and this is more typical of Europe, that there's so many people identified going in,
[3:15:09.280 --> 3:15:17.280]  they'll look like asses if they don't, then they'll put it on the internet, and it's still possible they'll dump it on the internet next Monday.
[3:15:17.280 --> 3:15:20.280]  Well, yeah, next Monday.
[3:15:20.280 --> 3:15:31.280]  But I doubt it, because I think we need to identify as many as by sight as we can going in and use other means to find out who's there and publish as many names as possible.
[3:15:31.280 --> 3:15:33.280]  As best you can tell, what's on the table?
[3:15:33.280 --> 3:15:42.280]  Is it who's going to be the Vice President nomination for the Democrats and the Republicans? Is it who's going to be the presidential nomination for the Democrats?
[3:15:42.280 --> 3:15:46.280]  Is it going to be Iran? Is it going to be the economy? Is it going to be all of these issues?
[3:15:46.280 --> 3:15:54.280]  All of these things on the presidential level, they already are confident that they own all three candidates.
[3:15:54.280 --> 3:16:08.280]  Cain, Obama, and Hillary, if she pulls off a miracle of some kind, they own them all, and all will support, regardless of their political posture, all will support NAFTA, extending NAFTA.
[3:16:08.280 --> 3:16:17.280]  In fact, Jimmy Lee Hogan of the Washington Post is going to be speaking at the Bilderberg meeting.
[3:16:17.280 --> 3:16:23.280]  I'll explain how Americans have to learn how to pool their sovereignty in this new term.
[3:16:23.280 --> 3:16:27.280]  Oh, so they're basically going to be talking about the North American Union a lot here, too.
[3:16:27.280 --> 3:16:41.280]  Yeah, exactly. And Americans must be educated to accept the pooling of their sovereignty so we can build a strong economic union here in North America.
[3:16:41.280 --> 3:16:45.280]  And of course, we all know where that's supposed to lead to.
[3:16:45.280 --> 3:16:57.280]  Yeah, this has been on the agenda for quite some time now. We have the SPP documents, the Securities and Prosperity Partnerships, where Bush, Vicente Fox, and the president of Canada got together without the American people's knowledge,
[3:16:57.280 --> 3:17:08.280]  without the Canadians' people knowledge, decided they were going to build this superstructure of four super highways gutting through the country and pass all these trade agreements that will essentially deteriorate our borders,
[3:17:08.280 --> 3:17:20.280]  both along Canada and Mexico, and build this North American Union. We've had CAFTA since 2004. We've had NAFTA prior to that, and it really looks like they're ready to take that next step, Jim.
[3:17:20.280 --> 3:17:39.280]  Well, yes, the next step as far as the world government, they've stepped toward the American Union along the lines of the European Union, is this North American pre-trade thing, NAFTA, is to expand throughout the Western Hemisphere, as you know.
[3:17:39.280 --> 3:17:58.280]  Now, Bilderberg is behind schedule, though. They're disappointed in themselves with some extent because in the 1990s, they were confidently predicting that by the year 2000, they'd have an American Union type of state of a trade zone.
[3:17:58.280 --> 3:18:18.280]  Well, I feel like we keep pushing them back. Well, I agree with you there, and I think we keep pushing back their plan, although incrementally, it does seem to keep moving forward.
[3:18:18.280 --> 3:18:28.280]  Now, last year, you said that it was on the table that they were discussing the Ron Paul and this Patriot movement problem they were having. Do you think that they're going to be discussing Ron Paul again this year?
[3:18:28.280 --> 3:18:40.280]  Yes, because they worried about the permanency of Ron Paul at the Trilateral Commission meeting in March a couple of weeks ago. As you know, the Trilateral Commission is their junior varsity.
[3:18:40.280 --> 3:18:50.280]  They have interlocking leadership, common agenda. In fact, the Trilateral agenda tells us much about the Bilderberg agenda, because it's very much the same.
[3:18:50.280 --> 3:19:02.280]  I have heard that. I did not know that they discussed Ron Paul yet again at the Trilateral meeting. That's a big story right there, Jim. What are they trying to do to contain him, to get him out of office altogether?
[3:19:02.280 --> 3:19:10.280]  And he has a number one book on the New York Times bestselling list. It's going to be hard to keep this guy silent. I mean, they've done a poor job in doing so.
[3:19:10.280 --> 3:19:31.280]  And the fact that they are worried about Ron Paul, promotes Ron Paul among our readers and your viewers, well, they expressed their concern that he's educating a young generation of Americans in nationalism, which is a wicked term in their view.
[3:19:31.280 --> 3:19:34.280]  Absolutely. It's Jim Tucker. We'll be back after this is the Alex Jones show.

[3:21:43.280 --> 3:22:08.280]  Let's join the info war today.
[3:22:08.280 --> 3:22:23.280]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%. It's bad enough that the U.S. citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce. However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.

[3:24:14.280 --> 3:24:24.280]  All right, we are back. It is the Alex Jones show. I am Jason Burma subbing in for Alex for the rest of the week as he's out at Bilderberg with Jim Tucker, who we have on the line.
[3:24:24.280 --> 3:24:39.280]  I remind people that the money bomb is still going on until Friday. We're going to release the totals after we get all the checks and everything else on Friday. Let you know how much we've made. We've made over $200,000 to go towards a new television station that fights the info war.
[3:24:39.280 --> 3:24:45.280]  Folks, I'm very psyched up for that. I'm going to be playing more of that stern clip in a little while and we're going to take your phone calls.
[3:24:45.280 --> 3:24:59.280]  In the last half hour of the show, I want to let people know that I have a little website, loosechange911.com. You can go check out my blog. I just posted, I think, five or six clips of Manetta describing what happened in the PEOC on 9-11.
[3:24:59.280 --> 3:25:09.280]  And we update that every day or so. And if you want to get a hard copy of Loose Change, we would appreciate it. You can make copies, hand those films out. It's been very effective for us so far.
[3:25:09.280 --> 3:25:19.280]  Getting back to Jim Tucker, an amazing journalist for... Geez, Jim, you've been covering Bilderberg for what, almost 30 years now?
[3:25:19.280 --> 3:25:20.280]  Are you with us, Jim?
[3:25:20.280 --> 3:25:21.280]  Yeah.
[3:25:21.280 --> 3:25:24.280]  How long have you been covering Bilderberg?
[3:25:24.280 --> 3:25:30.280]  Well, since 1975 when the spotlight was introduced to me.
[3:25:30.280 --> 3:25:40.280]  So that's 30 plus years. 30 plus years.
[3:25:40.280 --> 3:25:54.280]  I mean, I've seen some amazing specials on you on this information when I was first introduced to Bilderberg. You were the main guy, the guy that's been going out there for years and years and years and talking about how could this organization exist and you not know it.
[3:25:54.280 --> 3:26:03.280]  And then to find out who it consists of, how it's part of this elite control over the world, over the world towards this one world government agenda.
[3:26:03.280 --> 3:26:17.280]  It's mind-blowing stuff. And I'd like to get your take on what you think the plan is for the Middle East. What are they going to be talking about? Are they going to be talking about Iran? How to provoke an attack? How to go into Iran? What do you think?
[3:26:17.280 --> 3:26:34.280]  I think the European will oppose the invasion of Iran for which, as you know, our public is being politically conditioned to view as necessary for our survival in all of that jazz.
[3:26:34.280 --> 3:26:52.280]  I think the Europeans will oppose that, even if they oppose the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan. By the way, I wish we had more time to talk, but I was told to stand by for, call it three o'clock our time, or about 15 minutes in today's our deadline.
[3:26:52.280 --> 3:26:54.280]  So we'll have to hurry this along a little bit.
[3:26:54.280 --> 3:27:06.280]  Okay, sure. Whenever you have to go, just let me know. So do you think that Iran is going to be, what do you think they're going to decide? Are they going to decide to back off, wait for a new administration to come in?
[3:27:06.280 --> 3:27:18.280]  Or do you think that they're more likely to say, let's provocate an event to get us into Iran during the transition period before, after the elections? What are Jim Tucker's thoughts on the matter?
[3:27:18.280 --> 3:27:34.280]  I think to their credit, I can't remember ever saying this before, that the Europeans will pressure the U.S. government not to invade and leave it dangle for the next man in the White House to deal with.
[3:27:34.280 --> 3:27:55.280]  I think they'll just pressure Bush to not do it as badly as he wants to do it. And of course, the, as the whole world does, troops are spread too thin. We're now recruiting for combat through age 42, but in all of World War II, the combat age limit was 30, was at age 38.
[3:27:55.280 --> 3:28:20.280]  We're now accepting felons and fat guys into the service would not qualify in World War II. We're spread that thin in the so-called no draft years, although the backdoor draft, as we've mentioned, exists when they say, even though your term is up, we're not going to let you go for three more years
[3:28:20.280 --> 3:28:34.280]  because we need you. Now, the recruiting sergeant did not tell the recruit that even though you've only listed for three years, we can make you stay six years. But all that's happening, I'll have to tell you goodbye very shortly there.
[3:28:34.280 --> 3:28:51.280]  No, Jim, I just wish you the best over at Bilderberg. I hope you and Alex get some great material. I hope you'll be checking in with Alex in the next few days. And God bless you, sir. And I just, you know, I got to commend you for all the great work that you've done for this country.
[3:28:51.280 --> 3:28:55.280]  And, you know, just keep moving along. People are listening, Jim.
[3:28:55.280 --> 3:29:00.280]  Okay. Thank you very much. And I'll be talking to you from the Bilderberg thing. I think Thursday or Friday, Alex said.
[3:29:00.280 --> 3:29:11.280]  All right. Yes, definitely. All right. That's Jim Tucker, ladies and gentlemen, one of the great patriots of this nation, one of the true journalists that's going after the real stories.
[3:29:11.280 --> 3:29:35.280]  Well, it looks like we got another break coming up already. Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, LooseChains911.com, I'm Jason Bermas. We'll be back after this. PrisonPlanet.tv to check out the video feed.
[3:29:35.280 --> 3:29:45.280]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:45.280 --> 3:29:55.280]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents? Even fragrances can signal some 4000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.

[3:30:58.280 --> 3:31:09.280]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.

[3:31:36.280 --> 3:31:45.280]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war. Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[3:31:45.280 --> 3:31:55.280]  This is Steve Shank, J. Michael Stevens Group. Let's get real. Flower is already being rationed. Prices on food are getting so high, warehouses are installing security systems and guards.
[3:31:55.280 --> 3:32:07.280]  You can expect soon to see criminal activity in food. We're all in a foot race as to whether the food will become so expensive we can't afford it or there will be no food at any price.
[3:32:07.280 --> 3:32:15.280]  We can't grow enough of our own food even with genetically altered trash. It will give you the opportunity to eat perfectly engineered food.
[3:32:15.280 --> 3:32:31.280]  They think God didn't get it right, so Monsanto had to step in. If you think it's a little bit crazy to put in a supply of food, it's okay. We won't tell. Call 800-409-5633 on the web, eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:32:31.280 --> 3:32:46.280]  That's 800-409-5633. It may be a little bit crazy. That's okay. Because there is no such thing as a little bit dead.
[3:32:46.280 --> 3:33:04.280]  All right, folks. It's the Alex Jones show. We are back. I'm going to be playing a couple clips, taking a couple phone calls right now.
[3:33:04.280 --> 3:33:11.280]  The first clip I want to play before I get back to the Rosie O'Donnell Building 7 on Howard Stern, dropping some bombs.
[3:33:11.280 --> 3:33:22.280]  I want to play Bill Clinton admitting to attending the Bilderberg conference. Not only does he admit to attending the Bilderberg conference, but he also admits that they set policy there.
[3:33:22.280 --> 3:33:31.280]  He, however, denies that he was involved in setting any policy. He was there to talk to some Europeans about what was going to happen in Russia, but he surely does admit,
[3:33:31.280 --> 3:33:41.280]  I've been to the Bilderberg conference. It does exist. It's not some kind of made-up thing. And then his wife gets confronted by student scholars for 9-11 Truth, and she acts like she doesn't know what it is.
[3:33:41.280 --> 3:33:54.280]  My husband, I don't know. But we all know she more than likely attended in 2006 in Canada. All right, let's play this little Clinton clip. Let me see if I can get the video for the viewers out there.
[3:33:54.280 --> 3:34:00.280]  Probably not. I'm not that good at it. All right, we'll hit play anyway. And boom.
[3:34:00.280 --> 3:34:15.280]  Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait. Look, look. This is the deal, folks. All these people that are paranoid about the world come and scream at me everywhere.
[3:34:15.280 --> 3:34:32.280]  All right, I'll answer it. Okay, now wait a minute. Now, you said you would go if I answered the question, right? You said you would go if I answered the question.
[3:34:32.280 --> 3:34:40.280]  You said you would go if I answered the question. You said you would go if I answered the question. All right, here's the answer.
[3:34:40.280 --> 3:34:43.880]  I happened to be in Europe then on my way to Russia.
[3:34:43.880 --> 3:34:47.800]  I was invited to go to Bilderberg by Vernon Jordan, a friend of mine, and a genuine hero
[3:34:47.800 --> 3:34:49.400]  of the civil rights movement.
[3:34:49.400 --> 3:34:53.520]  And to the best of my knowledge, NAFTA was not discussed by anybody in my presence.
[3:34:53.520 --> 3:34:58.080]  I was talking to people who happened to be from Europe who did not give a rip about NAFTA.
[3:34:58.080 --> 3:35:06.880]  Number one, number, number two, okay.
[3:35:06.880 --> 3:35:12.240]  Number two, I tried to get labor and environmental standards in that agreement, but I couldn't
[3:35:12.240 --> 3:35:14.920]  because it was all negotiated when I got there.
[3:35:14.920 --> 3:35:20.360]  Number three, when I was president, we enforced our trade laws five times as much as the Bush
[3:35:20.360 --> 3:35:21.760]  administration did.
[3:35:21.760 --> 3:35:23.940]  We gained manufacturing jobs, wait a minute.
[3:35:23.940 --> 3:35:27.920]  We gained manufacturing jobs in six of the eight years I was president.
[3:35:27.920 --> 3:35:30.260]  They've lost manufacturing jobs in every year.
[3:35:30.260 --> 3:35:32.720]  We had 22.9 million new jobs.
[3:35:32.720 --> 3:35:34.620]  They've had five million.
[3:35:34.620 --> 3:35:38.800]  Early incomes went up $7,500 a year when I was president.
[3:35:38.800 --> 3:35:41.440]  They're down $1,000 now.
[3:35:41.440 --> 3:35:45.640]  We had almost 8 million people.
[3:35:45.640 --> 3:35:55.320]  So I had a very good time talking to those Europeans about European affairs and what
[3:35:55.320 --> 3:36:00.040]  was going to happen to Russia, but I was not somehow polluted by it into sacrificing America's
[3:36:00.040 --> 3:36:01.600]  economic interest.
[3:36:01.600 --> 3:36:04.720]  America did a lot better when I was president than they have in this decade, and that's
[3:36:04.720 --> 3:36:05.720]  the truth.
[3:36:05.720 --> 3:36:06.720]  Now, goodbye.
[3:36:06.720 --> 3:36:09.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, the king of spin.
[3:36:09.280 --> 3:36:10.280]  It's unbelievable.
[3:36:10.280 --> 3:36:15.440]  The man can admit to going to Bilderberg, admit that this secret meeting sets policy in Europe
[3:36:15.440 --> 3:36:19.240]  and America, and the people cheer him like he is a god.
[3:36:19.240 --> 3:36:21.300]  Man, you're good, Clinton.
[3:36:21.300 --> 3:36:22.640]  You are slick, buddy.
[3:36:22.640 --> 3:36:24.520]  You had me tricked when you were in office.
[3:36:24.520 --> 3:36:25.520]  I'm not going to lie.
[3:36:25.520 --> 3:36:27.760]  I was a little more ignorant then, but boy, you're good, man.
[3:36:27.760 --> 3:36:28.760]  You're really good.
[3:36:28.760 --> 3:36:29.760]  You hear the rabbit pants?
[3:36:29.760 --> 3:36:33.920]  Oh, Bill, you're so good.
[3:36:33.920 --> 3:36:34.920]  The Academy.
[3:36:34.920 --> 3:36:37.440]  Meanwhile, he's a puppet of the elite.
[3:36:37.440 --> 3:36:41.640]  He ran Coke for the Bush family in the 80s at Amina, Arkansas.
[3:36:41.640 --> 3:36:46.800]  It's time to wake up to reality, but according to Stern and his crew, conspiracies don't
[3:36:46.800 --> 3:36:51.200]  exist, and that's why we're going to play this second half of the clip of Rosie O'Donnell
[3:36:51.200 --> 3:36:55.720]  discussing World Trade Center Building 7 and Willie Rodriguez with the group over at Stern.
[3:36:55.720 --> 3:36:56.720]  Here we go.
[3:36:56.720 --> 3:36:57.720]  I actually do.
[3:36:57.720 --> 3:36:59.200]  I do believe he acted alone.
[3:36:59.200 --> 3:37:00.440]  I asked Donald Inspector about it.
[3:37:00.440 --> 3:37:01.440]  It makes sense to me.
[3:37:01.440 --> 3:37:02.440]  Well, that's OK.
[3:37:02.440 --> 3:37:05.440]  If it makes sense to you, look into it, Building 7, hit by no plane.
[3:37:05.440 --> 3:37:06.440]  Can I tell you something?
[3:37:06.440 --> 3:37:11.560]  Fred went to the book depository where Kennedy, where Lee Harvey Oswald did his thing, and
[3:37:11.560 --> 3:37:13.880]  he said, you are so close.
[3:37:13.880 --> 3:37:14.880]  You are so close to that moment.
[3:37:14.880 --> 3:37:19.520]  You could have thrown a rock at JFK, and you would have killed him.
[3:37:19.520 --> 3:37:22.080]  I was thinking about that whole 9-11 thing and the JFK thing.
[3:37:22.080 --> 3:37:23.360]  We get a lot of email about that.
[3:37:23.360 --> 3:37:24.880]  People say, no, it's a conspiracy.
[3:37:24.880 --> 3:37:29.160]  I think when there's a catastrophic event that you have no explanation for, it just
[3:37:29.160 --> 3:37:30.640]  kind of takes you by surprise.
[3:37:30.640 --> 3:37:35.680]  I think psychologically, you put it in the conspiracy box, and for some reason it makes
[3:37:35.680 --> 3:37:36.680]  you feel better.
[3:37:36.680 --> 3:37:37.680]  You can sleep in it.
[3:37:37.680 --> 3:37:38.680]  Can I tell you something?
[3:37:38.680 --> 3:37:41.680]  I'm one of those people who thinks Lee Harvey Oswald knocked down Building 7.
[3:37:41.680 --> 3:37:46.240]  But that's not to say that Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't doing it at the behest of somebody
[3:37:46.240 --> 3:37:47.240]  else.
[3:37:47.240 --> 3:37:50.880]  Well, the question is, why did the planes have to fly into the buildings first?
[3:37:50.880 --> 3:37:53.040]  Well, here's something that you should do, Howard.
[3:37:53.040 --> 3:37:54.920]  You should get this guy Willie Rodriguez.
[3:37:54.920 --> 3:37:57.520]  For 20 years, he was the janitor in Building 2.
[3:37:57.520 --> 3:37:59.320]  He cleaned all the stairwells.
[3:37:59.320 --> 3:38:01.880]  He had the only pass key for Building 2.
[3:38:01.880 --> 3:38:03.800]  He let the fireman in and up.
[3:38:03.800 --> 3:38:06.280]  He was the only one with strong enough legs to do it.
[3:38:06.280 --> 3:38:07.280]  The fireman was stopping.
[3:38:07.280 --> 3:38:09.720]  They had all this stuff on their backs.
[3:38:09.720 --> 3:38:15.080]  This guy has gone on every country and talked about what happened to him, what he heard
[3:38:15.080 --> 3:38:19.640]  before the planes, the people who were burned in the basement, why they were burned when
[3:38:19.640 --> 3:38:21.140]  a plane hit the top.
[3:38:21.140 --> 3:38:22.640]  I think you need to get him on the show.
[3:38:22.640 --> 3:38:23.640]  All right, I will.
[3:38:23.640 --> 3:38:24.640]  All right.
[3:38:24.640 --> 3:38:25.640]  Are you friends with Britney Spears?
[3:38:25.640 --> 3:38:26.640]  All right.
[3:38:26.640 --> 3:38:27.640]  Thanks.
[3:38:27.640 --> 3:38:30.320]  He's going to have Rodriguez on Willie.
[3:38:30.320 --> 3:38:31.320]  Please contact Howard.
[3:38:31.320 --> 3:38:33.720]  I'd love to hear you on Mr. Stern.
[3:38:33.720 --> 3:38:35.560]  I think you'd be a great guest.
[3:38:35.560 --> 3:38:40.800]  I think that your story may have them actually question the official version.
[3:38:40.800 --> 3:38:44.760]  The one thing I can't agree with Fred on, and I'm a big fan of the Stern show, I've grown
[3:38:44.760 --> 3:38:50.120]  up with it, is that this somehow makes me feel more comfortable, that my government may
[3:38:50.120 --> 3:38:53.120]  have been involved, that we haven't been told the truth about 9-11.
[3:38:53.120 --> 3:38:57.600]  I was a lot more comfortable when I thought it was dudes in a cave over in the desert
[3:38:57.600 --> 3:39:00.720]  that we could bomb, a lot more comfortable.
[3:39:00.720 --> 3:39:03.320]  In fact, I lost weeks of sleep.
[3:39:03.320 --> 3:39:08.160]  I have now dedicated my life to exposing the lie that is 9-11 because our entire foreign
[3:39:08.160 --> 3:39:14.360]  and domestic policy has been based on that lie, and I feel no such comfort in the fact
[3:39:14.360 --> 3:39:16.360]  that Cheney allowed the Pentagon attack to happen.
[3:39:16.360 --> 3:39:21.400]  I feel no such comfort that the insider trading went back to U.S. interests.
[3:39:21.400 --> 3:39:26.880]  I feel no such comfort that FBI whistleblowers like Robert Wright, John O'Neill, and others
[3:39:26.880 --> 3:39:29.280]  were silenced before and after 9-11.
[3:39:29.280 --> 3:39:31.080]  I find no comfort in that.
[3:39:31.080 --> 3:39:33.400]  With that being said, let's start to take some calls.
[3:39:33.400 --> 3:39:36.040]  Let's go to our first caller in Colorado, Steve.
[3:39:36.040 --> 3:39:37.040]  Steve, are you with me?
[3:39:37.040 --> 3:39:38.040]  Yeah.
[3:39:38.040 --> 3:39:39.040]  Hi there.
[3:39:39.040 --> 3:39:42.960]  I had questions on some things that you had mentioned.
[3:39:42.960 --> 3:39:51.240]  Who was the associate editor of, then I guess it was maybe the New York Times, Donald Graham's
[3:39:51.240 --> 3:39:52.240]  newspaper.
[3:39:52.240 --> 3:39:56.080]  Who was the associate editor that you said went to Bilderberg in O2?
[3:39:56.080 --> 3:39:57.840]  I'm not quite sure.
[3:39:57.840 --> 3:39:59.880]  Jim Tucker might have mentioned that.
[3:39:59.880 --> 3:40:01.600]  If Jim was still here, I'd have him answer the question.
[3:40:01.600 --> 3:40:03.760]  I'm not sure who that associate editor was.
[3:40:03.760 --> 3:40:04.760]  Oh, okay.
[3:40:04.760 --> 3:40:05.760]  All right.
[3:40:05.760 --> 3:40:13.120]  And then, do you know who it was that Reagan was going to initially pick as his vice president?
[3:40:13.120 --> 3:40:14.480]  Not, certainly not Bush.
[3:40:14.480 --> 3:40:16.880]  No, it wasn't Bush, but I'm not quite sure.
[3:40:16.880 --> 3:40:21.520]  I have seen a couple clips of their debates when Bush was still in the running for the
[3:40:21.520 --> 3:40:26.040]  presidency and they seemed to have some pretty different viewpoints.
[3:40:26.040 --> 3:40:29.400]  And as far as I know, it was the powers that be that said, look, you've got to take this
[3:40:29.400 --> 3:40:30.960]  guy as your running mate.
[3:40:30.960 --> 3:40:35.560]  And I mean, if you look at George H.W. Bush's history, he supposedly becomes the head of
[3:40:35.560 --> 3:40:37.640]  the CIA out of nowhere.
[3:40:37.640 --> 3:40:42.120]  Then he's thrust into the position of vice president under an actor for eight years and
[3:40:42.120 --> 3:40:43.720]  then into the presidency.
[3:40:43.720 --> 3:40:47.920]  And then the next guy who becomes president is the guy who was running drugs from Mina
[3:40:47.920 --> 3:40:49.680]  Arkansas for him.
[3:40:49.680 --> 3:40:50.680]  Okay.
[3:40:50.680 --> 3:40:52.920]  I mean, that stuff is crazy to me.
[3:40:52.920 --> 3:40:57.160]  I don't know if you're familiar with the continuity of government program or shadow
[3:40:57.160 --> 3:40:58.360]  government program.
[3:40:58.360 --> 3:41:02.360]  But that was started by the national programs office in the early 80s.
[3:41:02.360 --> 3:41:05.640]  And guess who our shadow government president was back then?
[3:41:05.640 --> 3:41:09.880]  It was none other than George H.W. Bush, as reported on by CNN.
[3:41:09.880 --> 3:41:14.000]  And Cheney has been in the succession program since its inception.
[3:41:14.000 --> 3:41:19.440]  And I truly believe that at least for public consumption, he still is the upper echelons
[3:41:19.440 --> 3:41:20.880]  of this shadow government.
[3:41:20.880 --> 3:41:21.880]  Okay.
[3:41:21.880 --> 3:41:26.720]  Well, see also, you had mentioned earlier about, I think you said a guy by name of Carl
[3:41:26.720 --> 3:41:33.640]  Cameron had a story on the filming of the first aircraft going into the World Trade
[3:41:33.640 --> 3:41:34.640]  Center.
[3:41:34.640 --> 3:41:39.080]  Well, what Carl Cameron and Britt Hume did was they did a four-part series on the people
[3:41:39.080 --> 3:41:42.280]  that had been detained before, during, and after 9-11.
[3:41:42.280 --> 3:41:45.840]  And those people were actually part of the detainees.
[3:41:45.840 --> 3:41:50.000]  Now, they don't mention the recording of the attack themselves.
[3:41:50.000 --> 3:41:55.320]  They go more into the ring, what the FBI had to say about it, how they had a classified
[3:41:55.320 --> 3:42:02.240]  role in 9-11, how this Israeli spy ring was using art students, how it had infiltrated
[3:42:02.240 --> 3:42:06.600]  the FBI, the CIA, the Secret Service, the DEA, all these different departments.
[3:42:06.600 --> 3:42:11.640]  And that they had done so earlier in the late 90s to the Los Angeles Police Department and
[3:42:11.640 --> 3:42:13.480]  basically compromised all these people.
[3:42:13.480 --> 3:42:19.440]  And they did so through Amdox, Converse, and this front as Israeli art students.
[3:42:19.440 --> 3:42:24.360]  Now they also used urban moving systems, who these other people who were detained were
[3:42:24.360 --> 3:42:25.520]  connected to.
[3:42:25.520 --> 3:42:33.000]  I would suggest typing in Israelis detained or Israelis record first attack.
[3:42:33.000 --> 3:42:36.240]  And you could actually watch them admit on that television show that they were there
[3:42:36.240 --> 3:42:37.240]  to record the event.
[3:42:37.240 --> 3:42:38.240]  Okay.
[3:42:38.240 --> 3:42:44.640]  And then the last thing is, do you know of any particular videos that actually have
[3:42:44.640 --> 3:42:48.620]  any footage of the first aircraft hitting the World Trade Center?
[3:42:48.620 --> 3:42:53.320]  There are two videos of what hit the World Trade Center, the first aircraft.
[3:42:53.320 --> 3:42:58.560]  There is, of course, the famous Nadeh Brothers film, where the firefighter is sitting there
[3:42:58.560 --> 3:43:01.360]  looking for a gas leak or something, and then they film it first.
[3:43:01.360 --> 3:43:05.520]  And then there was another gentleman who was on the freeway just kind of taping, and you
[3:43:05.520 --> 3:43:11.600]  can barely see the plane, you see like a little dot, and then the tower explode, and a little
[3:43:11.600 --> 3:43:14.320]  bit of a zoom in, but you really can't make much out of it.
[3:43:14.320 --> 3:43:19.160]  Now as far as I know, this third tape that the Israelis took has still been classified
[3:43:19.160 --> 3:43:20.360]  and has never been released.
[3:43:20.360 --> 3:43:21.360]  Oh, I see.
[3:43:21.360 --> 3:43:22.360]  Okay.
[3:43:22.360 --> 3:43:23.360]  Well, thank you very much.
[3:43:23.360 --> 3:43:24.360]  You got it, Steve.
[3:43:24.360 --> 3:43:25.360]  Thank you for the call.
[3:43:25.360 --> 3:43:26.360]  Let's go to John in Ohio.
[3:43:26.360 --> 3:43:27.840]  John, you're on the air.
[3:43:27.840 --> 3:43:28.840]  Yeah, I am.
[3:43:28.840 --> 3:43:31.840]  Before I get to my point, you're absolutely right.
[3:43:31.840 --> 3:43:39.160]  It's far from comforting to think that a military industrial media, oil corporation complex
[3:43:39.160 --> 3:43:43.680]  is running our lives, is killing millions of people around the world, lying to us, threatening
[3:43:43.680 --> 3:43:45.600]  us and will even kill the president.
[3:43:45.600 --> 3:43:50.400]  That kind of a throwaway line has been used by everybody, it's so tiresome.
[3:43:50.400 --> 3:43:55.480]  But what I wanted to really mention to Alex Jones, if you could pass it on, the local
[3:43:55.480 --> 3:44:01.720]  station here, AM, that runs his show has abruptly flushed him down the toilet after he built
[3:44:01.720 --> 3:44:08.560]  up an audience and ratings for them, and has, of all people, substituted this arch vile
[3:44:08.560 --> 3:44:15.560]  deal con, the worst of them, Michael Savage, his absolute opposite ideologically.
[3:44:15.560 --> 3:44:22.680]  And this Kenton station, Kenton, Ohio station is W-C-E-R.
[3:44:22.680 --> 3:44:27.200]  And if anyone wants to call him, I would give the phone number for the, you know, to complain
[3:44:27.200 --> 3:44:28.200]  about it.
[3:44:28.200 --> 3:44:32.280]  I would say post it and we'll post a story over at infowars.com, I don't want to give
[3:44:32.280 --> 3:44:34.280]  it out over the radio just because.
[3:44:34.280 --> 3:44:37.320]  W-C-E-R, a radio, Kenton, Ohio.
[3:44:37.320 --> 3:44:44.280]  And I also wanted to mention that, you know, the lies were being told that, at least in
[3:44:44.280 --> 3:44:50.440]  halfway fashion, have been brought up by McClellan, you know, it has, I think, a much more powerful
[3:44:50.440 --> 3:44:55.600]  interest coming from someone like him, even though it's halfway, because I got to think
[3:44:55.600 --> 3:44:59.600]  there's this kind of split you're talking about, that even people that are loyal mouthpieces
[3:44:59.600 --> 3:45:05.160]  for these crazies in the White House are not willing to go to the point of an attack on
[3:45:05.160 --> 3:45:06.160]  Iran.
[3:45:06.160 --> 3:45:09.760]  And this absolutely does destroy some more of his credibility.
[3:45:09.760 --> 3:45:14.880]  And I think there's a real need to bring the alarm bells, as even Ray McGovern said
[3:45:14.880 --> 3:45:20.560]  on the Jones program a while back, a country like Israel, which is so heavily involved
[3:45:20.560 --> 3:45:25.840]  along with our own military-industrial complex, knows it can get away with virtually anything.
[3:45:25.840 --> 3:45:31.240]  It can bomb an American ship, murder American soldiers, and get away with it throughout
[3:45:31.240 --> 3:45:35.000]  all of these years with Republicans, Democrats, and the media.
[3:45:35.000 --> 3:45:42.240]  And in that kind of a situation, I think the exposure of Israel's crimes has to be broken
[3:45:42.240 --> 3:45:46.000]  through in the media, this kind of sacred cow status that it has.
[3:45:46.000 --> 3:45:50.400]  David Worms recently also left the administration, said that Cheney was trying to get Israel
[3:45:50.400 --> 3:45:56.400]  to attack Iran so that we could use them to launder our own attack when they had to retaliate
[3:45:56.400 --> 3:45:57.400]  against Israel.
[3:45:57.400 --> 3:46:03.040]  You know, the rebellious stalwart ally, so-called, of the United States has to be defended by
[3:46:03.040 --> 3:46:04.040]  the United States.
[3:46:04.040 --> 3:46:08.120]  This is one scenario that I think we have to knock down by knocking down the party.
[3:46:08.120 --> 3:46:13.200]  Well, there is no doubt that Israel is definitely a powerful arm of this military-industrial
[3:46:13.200 --> 3:46:14.480]  complex apparatus.
[3:46:14.480 --> 3:46:15.480]  I thank you for the call.
[3:46:15.480 --> 3:46:16.480]  One more thing.
[3:46:16.480 --> 3:46:21.360]  Well, I just let him go by accident, folks, I'm sorry about that, but WCER over in Canton,
[3:46:21.360 --> 3:46:24.920]  Ohio, getting rid of Jones from Michael Savage, that makes me a little nauseous.
[3:46:24.920 --> 3:46:27.880]  I mean, Michael Savage is just about the worst of the worst.
[3:46:27.880 --> 3:46:32.800]  I mean, I guess Limbaugh might be a little bit worse, but Michael Savage, no good, folks.
[3:46:32.800 --> 3:46:34.480]  Talk about your lies.
[3:46:34.480 --> 3:46:37.680]  Talk about just blind support of the power structure.
[3:46:37.680 --> 3:46:38.680]  That is Michael Savage.
[3:46:38.680 --> 3:46:41.480]  All right, let's go to John in Alabama.
[3:46:41.480 --> 3:46:42.480]  John, are you with me?
[3:46:42.480 --> 3:46:48.800]  Yes, Chase, and a shout-out to you and the other guys involved in loose change.
[3:46:48.800 --> 3:46:52.120]  Thank you.
[3:46:52.120 --> 3:46:56.680]  There doesn't seem to be a discernible 9-11 truth movement here in North Alabama, but
[3:46:56.680 --> 3:46:58.960]  there are a number of patriots.
[3:46:58.960 --> 3:47:07.520]  One of them is running for the House of Representatives seat vacated by Bud Kramer.
[3:47:07.520 --> 3:47:09.800]  He's a fellow named George Berry.
[3:47:09.800 --> 3:47:15.960]  He asked another one of the candidates if they supported the SPP, and he does not, and
[3:47:15.960 --> 3:47:23.160]  also he wants to end the war in Iraq, so I'd like to encourage anybody listening in the
[3:47:23.160 --> 3:47:27.680]  North Alabama region who might be able to be voting for him today to support George
[3:47:27.680 --> 3:47:28.680]  Berry.
[3:47:28.680 --> 3:47:29.680]  All right.
[3:47:29.680 --> 3:47:30.680]  Well, John, thank you very much for the call.
[3:47:30.680 --> 3:47:34.080]  John, I hope you do get involved in some kind of 9-11 truth movement, because it only
[3:47:34.080 --> 3:47:37.040]  takes a handful of people to get something started.
[3:47:37.040 --> 3:47:43.200]  We are change.org, truthalliance.net, truthaction.org.
[3:47:43.200 --> 3:47:46.520]  These are all grassroots organizations for the younger folks, students, scholars for
[3:47:46.520 --> 3:47:47.520]  9-11 truth.
[3:47:47.520 --> 3:47:49.760]  That's sst911.org.
[3:47:49.760 --> 3:47:50.760]  You can get involved.
[3:47:50.760 --> 3:47:53.040]  You can be the change you want to see in the world.
[3:47:53.040 --> 3:47:54.040]  That's why I love Luke Radowski.
[3:47:54.040 --> 3:47:57.400]  Luke's going to be down in Chantilly, Virginia, checking out Bill Herberg this year.
[3:47:57.400 --> 3:47:59.680]  He's one of my heroes.
[3:47:59.680 --> 3:48:02.640]  He stands up for what he believes, and he believes in the Constitution and the Bill
[3:48:02.640 --> 3:48:04.400]  of Rights, and he believes that we should be free.
[3:48:04.400 --> 3:48:06.400]  What a novel idea.
[3:48:06.400 --> 3:48:10.360]  He believes that the truth should come out, and there are truth tellers everywhere in
[3:48:10.360 --> 3:48:11.360]  this country.
[3:48:11.360 --> 3:48:14.200]  They don't get the exposure that they should.
[3:48:14.200 --> 3:48:16.160]  Jesse Winter going around is a great thing.
[3:48:16.160 --> 3:48:22.080]  Ron Paul, a best seller on the New York Times list, the number one guy, can't get booked
[3:48:22.080 --> 3:48:23.080]  on a talk show.
[3:48:23.080 --> 3:48:28.480]  Sure, he's getting booked on these alternative media shows all over the place, but where
[3:48:28.480 --> 3:48:29.480]  is he on Oprah?
[3:48:29.480 --> 3:48:31.400]  Oprah, why haven't you had Ron Paul on?
[3:48:31.400 --> 3:48:32.560]  What's going on?
[3:48:32.560 --> 3:48:35.080]  You need to have Ron Paul for an hour.
[3:48:35.080 --> 3:48:37.720]  Use your viewers to Ron Paul.
[3:48:37.720 --> 3:48:38.720]  What are you, scared of liberty?
[3:48:38.720 --> 3:48:39.720]  Are you scared of freedom?
[3:48:39.720 --> 3:48:45.800]  I mean, a book titled, Ron Paul Revolution, A Manifesto, is the number one book in the
[3:48:45.800 --> 3:48:46.800]  country.
[3:48:46.800 --> 3:48:47.800]  It boggles my mind.
[3:48:47.800 --> 3:48:53.040]  Yet, the mainstream media just sits there, acts like it doesn't exist, ignores it, ignores
[3:48:53.040 --> 3:48:56.600]  it, ignores it, and that's largely what they did to the 9-11 Truth Movement before Loose
[3:48:56.600 --> 3:49:03.400]  Change came out, and their inboxes were just cluttered with people saying, hey, take a look
[3:49:03.400 --> 3:49:04.400]  at this movie.
[3:49:04.400 --> 3:49:09.960]  You need to take a look at this information, and then they went on a discredit campaign.
[3:49:09.960 --> 3:49:12.720]  They went after the weakest claims in Loose Change.
[3:49:12.720 --> 3:49:14.600]  They misquoted us.
[3:49:14.600 --> 3:49:19.160]  They got Wally Miller to recant the story he had told for over a year that there were
[3:49:19.160 --> 3:49:23.640]  no bodies, that there was nobody on the scene of Shanksville, Pennsylvania, that they didn't
[3:49:23.640 --> 3:49:28.000]  even need a corner because there was nothing to do.
[3:49:28.000 --> 3:49:31.320]  They got this guy to flip, to turn.
[3:49:31.320 --> 3:49:32.480]  He says he was misquoted.
[3:49:32.480 --> 3:49:33.480]  Come on.
[3:49:33.480 --> 3:49:39.440]  He's gone on ABC special a year afterwards, clearly saying that there was no bodies.
[3:49:39.440 --> 3:49:42.040]  We went and interviewed the mayor of Indian Lake.
[3:49:42.040 --> 3:49:45.560]  He said he wouldn't have known a plane had crashed there unless someone had told him.
[3:49:45.560 --> 3:49:47.480]  That's kind of odd, don't you think?
[3:49:47.480 --> 3:49:52.040]  When you're on the scene of a plane crash in an open field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania,
[3:49:52.040 --> 3:49:55.000]  you happen to be the neighboring town's mayor.
[3:49:55.000 --> 3:49:57.080]  You get there, and there's no plane.
[3:49:57.080 --> 3:49:59.080]  It's wild.
[3:49:59.080 --> 3:50:00.360]  It's outlandish.
[3:50:00.360 --> 3:50:05.120]  I don't know what it's going to take to wake people up in this country.
[3:50:05.120 --> 3:50:06.120]  I really don't.
[3:50:06.120 --> 3:50:13.080]  Hopefully, it's going to take InfoWars doing this new television network, InfoWars.com,
[3:50:13.080 --> 3:50:15.080]  PrismPlan.com, PrismPlan.tv.
[3:50:15.080 --> 3:50:18.920]  Well, the new TV network, maybe that's the boost in the arm we need, and that's why we
[3:50:18.920 --> 3:50:23.320]  need people to continue to give this Money Bombs not over until Friday.
[3:50:23.320 --> 3:50:25.840]  Final segment on the other side, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[3:50:25.840 --> 3:50:45.880]  I'm Jason Bermas, we'll be back after this.
[3:50:45.880 --> 3:50:50.400]  With the hot and muggy season upon us, most people shut their windows to stay cool.
[3:50:50.400 --> 3:50:55.240]  The problem is, the air you breathe inside your home is not as clean as outdoor air.
[3:50:55.240 --> 3:50:59.800]  And who wants an ugly, plastic, noisy air purifier taking up space in their beautiful
[3:50:59.800 --> 3:51:00.800]  home?
[3:51:00.800 --> 3:51:05.640]  Well, there is an alternative, Himalayan crystal salt lamps from Ionic salts.
[3:51:05.640 --> 3:51:08.880]  These lamps are handmade from the most prized salts on the planet.
[3:51:08.880 --> 3:51:12.600]  With so many various lamps to choose from, your home will look good and you'll feel
[3:51:12.600 --> 3:51:13.600]  great.

[3:51:18.480 --> 3:51:19.480]  lamps.

[3:51:24.080 --> 3:51:25.720]  more relaxation.

[3:51:45.600 --> 3:51:47.560]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[3:51:47.560 --> 3:51:52.080]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest
[3:51:52.080 --> 3:51:53.600]  hour there is hope.
[3:51:53.600 --> 3:51:56.720]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[3:51:56.720 --> 3:52:00.920]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New
[3:52:00.920 --> 3:52:02.440]  World Order master plan.
[3:52:02.440 --> 3:52:06.680]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[3:52:06.680 --> 3:52:11.880]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[3:52:11.880 --> 3:52:14.920]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[3:52:14.920 --> 3:52:19.480]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly
[3:52:19.480 --> 3:52:22.120]  to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.

[3:52:33.280 --> 3:52:35.720]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.

[3:52:45.920 --> 3:52:47.560]  Can a magnet relieve pain?
[3:52:47.560 --> 3:52:49.440]  Can a magnet kill bacteria?
[3:52:49.440 --> 3:52:51.760]  Can a magnet address your health concerns?
[3:52:51.760 --> 3:52:53.880]  Lion Legacy has the answer.
[3:52:53.880 --> 3:52:59.040]  Lion Legacy has been around for 17 years and has coined the phrase, properly designed therapeutic
[3:52:59.040 --> 3:53:00.040]  magnets.
[3:53:00.040 --> 3:53:03.720]  Lion Legacy offers therapeutic magnets that are used by people all around the world with
[3:53:03.720 --> 3:53:04.920]  great success.
[3:53:04.920 --> 3:53:08.960]  These are not everyday magnets that are designed to hold a report card on the refrigerator.
[3:53:08.960 --> 3:53:12.000]  No, these magnets are nothing like you've ever seen.
[3:53:12.000 --> 3:53:13.240]  What makes them different?
[3:53:13.240 --> 3:53:14.240]  What makes them unique?
[3:53:14.240 --> 3:53:18.680]  Well, the poles are separated to deliver the healing energy of the North Pole and are
[3:53:18.680 --> 3:53:21.480]  large enough to deliver an effective force field.
[3:53:21.480 --> 3:53:24.800]  They're so durable that if you happen to drop them, they won't lose their strength.
[3:53:24.800 --> 3:53:28.240]  There is nothing more natural and safe than magnetic therapy.
[3:53:28.240 --> 3:53:32.120]  Lion Legacy has developed a line of supplements that improve the effectiveness of the magnets
[3:53:32.120 --> 3:53:33.120]  even more.
[3:53:33.120 --> 3:53:38.560]  For more information, visit lionlegacy.com or call 800-778-5731.
[3:53:38.560 --> 3:54:02.560]  Or go to lyonlegacy.com today.
[3:54:02.560 --> 3:54:17.440]  All right, folks, we're back in the Alex Jones show, final segment.
[3:54:17.440 --> 3:54:18.800]  Alex is off to Bilderberg.
[3:54:18.800 --> 3:54:20.800]  I'm nothing but excited.
[3:54:20.800 --> 3:54:21.800]  I am Jason Bermas.
[3:54:21.800 --> 3:54:23.880]  I'm going to be your host for the next few days.
[3:54:23.880 --> 3:54:29.760]  I want to let you know that the rebroadcast starts in only six minutes over at infowars.com.
[3:54:29.760 --> 3:54:32.760]  It plays on a four-hour constant loop.
[3:54:32.760 --> 3:54:36.400]  You can check out Alex in the first hour, Mike Rivera in the second hour, Richard Cook
[3:54:36.400 --> 3:54:40.240]  in the third hour, and of course, Jim Tucker not so long ago.
[3:54:40.240 --> 3:54:41.240]  I got this stack of news.
[3:54:41.240 --> 3:54:45.560]  I just want to go through some of it real quick before I take my final caller.
[3:54:45.560 --> 3:54:51.480]  The mail online is reporting that parents are now going to have to give their biometric
[3:54:51.480 --> 3:54:54.640]  thumb scan to go pick their kids up at nursery schools.
[3:54:54.640 --> 3:54:58.760]  This is going on in Kent, apparently, and parents are told they won't be able to come
[3:54:58.760 --> 3:55:01.720]  and get their children unless they want to be part of this database.
[3:55:01.720 --> 3:55:02.720]  That sounds great.
[3:55:02.720 --> 3:55:06.320]  Let's be part of a biometric database to come pick up our kids.
[3:55:06.320 --> 3:55:08.320]  That's a great idea.
[3:55:08.320 --> 3:55:10.680]  Let's just give up all of our info.
[3:55:10.680 --> 3:55:12.520]  Good stuff right there.
[3:55:12.520 --> 3:55:16.480]  Then of course, the standard new equipment where soldiers are able to see through walls
[3:55:16.480 --> 3:55:22.040]  and now police officers are able to see through walls and then Time Warner running a new plan
[3:55:22.040 --> 3:55:28.160]  out in Beaumont, Texas, where they're going to try to charge users for the amount of information
[3:55:28.160 --> 3:55:29.920]  that they download off the internet.
[3:55:29.920 --> 3:55:34.520]  Now, this is going to be troublesome for someone like myself who likes a lot of audio and visual
[3:55:34.520 --> 3:55:35.520]  content.
[3:55:35.520 --> 3:55:41.080]  They're going to try to charge a dollar per gigabyte of over usage.
[3:55:41.080 --> 3:55:46.920]  Let's say the standard movie is around between 700 megabytes and a gig and a half.
[3:55:46.920 --> 3:55:53.000]  If I do that too much, if I get too many movies from the internet or if I get too many MP3s
[3:55:53.000 --> 3:55:58.560]  or radio shows from the internet or even high quality downloads that I grab from FTP sites
[3:55:58.560 --> 3:56:02.880]  for my work, in other words uncompressed video, apparently I'm going to start to be penalized.
[3:56:02.880 --> 3:56:08.560]  This has been the plan all the time to get the internet out of the hands of the people,
[3:56:08.560 --> 3:56:12.960]  to restrict it further and further and further and eventually bring in internet too when
[3:56:12.960 --> 3:56:17.680]  the servers crash where we'll all have to biometrically scan and be identified when
[3:56:17.680 --> 3:56:19.180]  we enter the internet.
[3:56:19.180 --> 3:56:22.960]  There will be a small handful of corporations and universities that are in control of the
[3:56:22.960 --> 3:56:26.600]  internet and if we're lucky, we'll be able to have a sub domain page.
[3:56:26.600 --> 3:56:28.640]  Sounds like a wonderful idea.
[3:56:28.640 --> 3:56:30.840]  All right, let's take our last caller.
[3:56:30.840 --> 3:56:32.440]  Let's go to Jason in California.
[3:56:32.440 --> 3:56:33.440]  Jason, are you with me?
[3:56:33.440 --> 3:56:34.440]  Yes, I am.
[3:56:34.440 --> 3:56:36.440]  A long time, first time.
[3:56:36.440 --> 3:56:40.720]  I just wanted to ask you, Jason, I haven't heard in a while, but I was wondering if and
[3:56:40.720 --> 3:56:45.200]  when your loose change film is going to come out of the theaters.
[3:56:45.200 --> 3:56:49.680]  You know, I wouldn't bet on it, I mean, we went through so many things to try to get
[3:56:49.680 --> 3:56:55.040]  that into theaters and talk to people at Paramount, talk to Mark Cuban's company, obviously spend
[3:56:55.040 --> 3:56:57.040]  some time with Charlie Sheen.
[3:56:57.040 --> 3:57:02.920]  We had one thing on paper that gave us really no guarantees, no creative control whatsoever.
[3:57:02.920 --> 3:57:04.080]  I'm sorry to hear that.
[3:57:04.080 --> 3:57:08.480]  Well, when we saw that and not only that, but they also wanted to own the second edition
[3:57:08.480 --> 3:57:11.680]  of the film and they wanted us to take that off the internet altogether.
[3:57:11.680 --> 3:57:15.560]  Now, I'm sure you know that it's such an internet phenomenon that would have been virtually impossible
[3:57:15.560 --> 3:57:16.560]  for us to do.
[3:57:16.560 --> 3:57:21.840]  And then we would have to indemnify them against that, against it being posted on the net.
[3:57:21.840 --> 3:57:27.360]  So they really made it utterly impossible for us to be able to put this out into mainstream
[3:57:27.360 --> 3:57:28.360]  theaters.
[3:57:28.360 --> 3:57:33.120]  And really, unfortunately, I have not seen anything from Magnolia Pictures or 2929,
[3:57:33.120 --> 3:57:37.600]  the main company that we discussed this with, that they've promoted any of this hardcore
[3:57:37.600 --> 3:57:38.600]  material.
[3:57:38.600 --> 3:57:39.600]  I mean, they had redacted.
[3:57:39.600 --> 3:57:42.920]  It was barely around, so I would hate to see loose change shelved.
[3:57:42.920 --> 3:57:47.440]  I mean, you can watch the Final Cut for free right now on Google Video and I encourage people
[3:57:47.440 --> 3:57:48.440]  to do so.
[3:57:48.440 --> 3:57:49.440]  Have you seen the Final Cut yet, Jason?
[3:57:49.440 --> 3:57:50.440]  I have.
[3:57:50.440 --> 3:57:51.440]  I think it's great.
[3:57:51.440 --> 3:57:52.440]  Well, thank you, man.
[3:57:52.440 --> 3:57:55.080]  And hopefully there's going to be a slightly different version coming out, a little bit
[3:57:55.080 --> 3:57:56.080]  more well-edited.
[3:57:56.080 --> 3:57:58.480]  But we're going to be giving it away for free again, man.
[3:57:58.480 --> 3:58:01.880]  You can check it out, probably a higher quality over at Prison Planet, but it's going to be
[3:58:01.880 --> 3:58:02.880]  on Google Video.
[3:58:02.880 --> 3:58:04.400]  We're here to share the info.
[3:58:04.400 --> 3:58:08.720]  This is the Alex Jones show, folks, and we're just going to keep re-upping our efforts.
[3:58:08.720 --> 3:58:12.960]  Remember, the re-feed starts in about 30 seconds.
[3:58:12.960 --> 3:58:27.280]  My website's LooseChange911.com, PrisonPlanet.com, thanks for joining me.

[3:58:36.160 --> 3:58:40.400]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[3:58:40.400 --> 3:58:44.960]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:58:44.960 --> 3:58:47.280]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[3:58:47.280 --> 3:58:50.960]  Could their objective be world domination?
[3:58:50.960 --> 3:58:54.120]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:58:54.120 --> 3:59:00.040]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[3:59:00.040 --> 3:59:02.720]  of humanity is at hand.
[3:59:02.720 --> 3:59:09.480]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:59:09.480 --> 3:59:13.800]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:59:13.800 --> 3:59:16.480]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[3:59:16.480 --> 3:59:17.480]  Most people have no idea.
[3:59:17.480 --> 3:59:18.480]  They're not after money.
[3:59:18.480 --> 3:59:19.480]  They have all the money they need.
[3:59:19.480 --> 3:59:20.480]  They're after power.
[3:59:20.480 --> 3:59:21.480]  Yes, they're after music.

[3:59:30.240 --> 3:59:33.240]  Blue prep for global enslavement.
[3:59:33.240 --> 3:59:38.600]  You have been warned.
[3:59:38.600 --> 3:59:45.400]  This is the GCN Radio Network, home to hard-hitting talk on the radio.
[3:59:45.400 --> 3:59:47.440]  Are you worried about your credit card debt?
[3:59:47.440 --> 4:00:03.600]  Sky-high interest rates.
