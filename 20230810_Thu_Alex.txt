[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:26.560]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.120]  When castles towered over vast landscapes and knights championed honor and valor, there
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.520]  came an unforeseen darkness.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.400]  Amidst this impending doom stood a knight called Alex Jones, a brave and outspoken herald
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.880]  known as the Truth Sayer.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.960]  Sir Alex Jones was not alone.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.200]  In his most desperate hour in the battle against evil, a radiant light descended from the
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.200]  heavens.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.680]  God, in all his glory and his legion of angels, stood by Alex's side.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.880]  The battle raged on, but with every blow, Alex Jones' conviction grew stronger.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.520]  With every truth he proclaimed, the demonic forces faltered.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.080]  When the enemy was vanquished, Alex Jones swore a solemn oath that should the realm
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:16.200]  need him again, he would return, and now it's Alex Jones leading a full frontal assault
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.480]  on the satanic New World Order.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.200]  Tune in at InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[00:08:30.021 --> 00:08:41.301]  And it is just unspeakable what they are doing to us. Now I want to play you a
[00:08:41.301 --> 00:08:51.181]  clip of this doctor, medical doctor, and all he's doing is reading from mouse
[00:08:51.181 --> 00:09:02.301]  studies the University of Texas did. We covered three years ago where all the
[00:09:02.301 --> 00:09:12.541]  mice died an accelerated death and the average was two months. Some lived six
[00:09:12.541 --> 00:09:19.501]  months but they all had their life expectancies cut in about half when they
[00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:31.461]  gave them an mRNA cold virus so-called vaccine. So I get up about 6 a.m. this
[00:09:31.461 --> 00:09:34.661]  morning and I'm doing some research and I and I see this doctor talking about it
[00:09:34.661 --> 00:09:39.501]  and it reminded me of that and it made me mad because I remember covering it at
[00:09:39.501 --> 00:09:46.381]  nauseam but there's so much evil that even when you're on the front lines of
[00:09:46.381 --> 00:09:52.781]  the fight you compartmentalize it so you don't go crazy. And then I saw all
[00:09:52.781 --> 00:09:59.621]  these headlines out of ABC News, CBS News, all of them making the big announcement
[00:09:59.621 --> 00:10:06.141]  we told you was about to happen. Oh suddenly millions of people around the
[00:10:06.141 --> 00:10:11.581]  world including 450 plus thousand in the U.S. suddenly have been bitten by a tick
[00:10:11.581 --> 00:10:15.181]  even though they didn't find a tick even though a tick didn't bite them and they
[00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:20.941]  have the alpha-gal syndrome where they can't eat beef and other meats anymore
[00:10:20.941 --> 00:10:27.981]  particularly red meat. Now I have the CDC and FDA documents where they admit it's
[00:10:27.981 --> 00:10:39.021]  in the shot so they're doing it to us. Just like in October of 2020 the CDC and
[00:10:39.021 --> 00:10:45.501]  the FDA put out a prediction sheet of what they believe the shot would do in
[00:10:45.501 --> 00:10:53.261]  the adverse reactions and what did it say? It said Guillain-Barre heart attacks
[00:10:53.261 --> 00:11:00.901]  myocarditis blood clots strokes and dozens and dozens of other horrible
[00:11:00.901 --> 00:11:04.781]  things that happened because they knew exactly what they were doing because
[00:11:04.781 --> 00:11:13.621]  they tested on mice and monkeys and pigs and dogs. So at that point I get a little bit
[00:11:13.621 --> 00:11:18.821]  more angry and then I just look at article after article where they're
[00:11:18.821 --> 00:11:23.261]  rolling out how they're slowly killing us and their social engineering and
[00:11:23.261 --> 00:11:29.221]  their conditioning mutating our bodies and sitting back and laughing and they
[00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:34.461]  think it's funny. The globalists and the mad scientists that run it and their
[00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:40.661]  moronic minions aren't just cutting off our pipelines or dissolving our borders
[00:11:40.661 --> 00:11:45.501]  or human trafficking or promoting pedophilia or starting psychotic insane
[00:11:45.501 --> 00:11:51.341]  war with Russia they are bombarding us with radiation bombarding us with
[00:11:51.341 --> 00:11:55.341]  electromagnetic radiation bombarding us with chemtrails and geoengineering
[00:11:55.341 --> 00:12:01.421]  aluminum dioxide barium salts and also radioactive isotopes they are bombarding
[00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:05.821]  us with biological and chemical weapons to the shots and the shedding and they
[00:12:05.821 --> 00:12:11.141]  are just murdering people and the insurance actuaries show that death
[00:12:11.141 --> 00:12:17.701]  rate not in the care of COVID 2020 but as soon as those shots roll in in
[00:12:17.701 --> 00:12:24.661]  England in October boom straight up and in January in the US boom straight up and
[00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:30.421]  in January in Canada boom straight up in Australia in January of 2021 boom
[00:12:30.421 --> 00:12:36.421]  straight up I mean they start those shots baby and the deaths go boom and
[00:12:36.421 --> 00:12:42.301]  they're just still going right up and it's all confirmed and it's all there
[00:12:42.301 --> 00:12:47.021]  and it's all peer-reviewed and the spontaneous abortions and the
[00:12:47.021 --> 00:12:51.261]  miscarriages and the blood clots and the murder and then I sit there and watch
[00:12:51.261 --> 00:12:56.221]  leftist and minions of the system dropping dead left and right too but
[00:12:56.221 --> 00:13:03.101]  they all got that demonic dim glow to their eyes and those weird soy boy
[00:13:03.101 --> 00:13:14.621]  smiles on their faces their cultural spiritual suicide bombers and it's not
[00:13:14.621 --> 00:13:21.540]  normal to get up here and just laugh about all this and who look hunter
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:29.181]  Biden's in trouble oh look people are on Biden's tail now Biden is a chew toy for
[00:13:29.181 --> 00:13:33.101]  conservatives and populists to think we're battling something when all he is
[00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:43.781]  is a storm wall all he is is a seawall to block us off from the New World Order on
[00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:49.821]  the other side so we scrabble and scrape and claw and every other show
[00:13:49.821 --> 00:13:53.061]  including our website I can't even control it it's just everywhere nothing
[00:13:53.061 --> 00:13:58.061]  but a hundred by nothing but Joe Biden nothing but and it's a total distraction
[00:13:58.061 --> 00:14:01.061]  because he's meant to be there till they're ready to get rid of him which
[00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:06.861]  is very soon it needs to be about the UN and the World Health Treaty taking over
[00:14:06.861 --> 00:14:12.901]  your body and the 5g and the fentanyl and the human trafficking and the GMO and
[00:14:12.901 --> 00:14:17.781]  the nanotech they are battering ramming our bodies with
[00:14:17.781 --> 00:14:22.540]  y'all can sit here and show you Biden in a speech he gave yesterday I watched it
[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:33.421]  this morning and it was all unintelligible hammered shit but he was
[00:14:33.421 --> 00:14:37.821]  put there to humiliate us he was put there to lower expectations he was put
[00:14:37.821 --> 00:14:44.621]  there to drag us to the mud look at that pathetic mindless pedophile so
[00:14:44.621 --> 00:14:49.741]  that's just some of the news we're gonna get to all of it got the official UN
[00:14:49.741 --> 00:14:53.581]  plan for world law to screw six-year-olds and take them away from
[00:14:53.581 --> 00:14:56.540]  you and rape the living daylights out of says we're gonna take your kids and have
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:02.181]  sex with them can't make this up a declaration of pedophilic offensive
[00:15:02.181 --> 00:15:12.501]  against humanity and I got the inflation spikes and the housing costs exploding
[00:15:12.501 --> 00:15:19.221]  and the average American can't even survive we're under total attack and
[00:15:19.221 --> 00:15:23.661]  then I'm the weirdo because I've studied it and I'm aware of it and I don't like
[00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:30.741]  it and I'm trying to warn you but I tell you who's really crazy it's the globalist
[00:15:30.741 --> 00:15:37.141]  they're never gonna get out of this so I guess that's the consolation prize
[00:15:37.141 --> 00:15:42.101]  here they may be killing a whole lot of us and hurting a whole lot of us but in
[00:15:42.101 --> 00:15:46.821]  the end they lit a fire under humanity's ass that when a focused diligent
[00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:51.261]  intelligent committed minority continues to spread the word and resist we will
[00:15:51.261 --> 00:15:56.381]  take back over our systems and we will defeat these scumbags because God is

[00:18:56.141 --> 00:19:03.581]  while you still can in the early 1900s certain companies were off gassing highly
[00:19:03.581 --> 00:19:07.981]  toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere the surrounding communities
[00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:13.581]  began to get sick laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install
[00:19:13.581 --> 00:19:19.141]  scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid still highly toxic
[00:19:19.141 --> 00:19:24.101]  but containable now these companies had a stockpile of this poison and there was
[00:19:24.101 --> 00:19:27.781]  no affordable way to dispose of it lucky for them one of their major
[00:19:27.781 --> 00:19:32.661]  stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury who was responsible for the
[00:19:32.661 --> 00:19:37.821]  Public Health Service at the time and by 1950 the US government began buying
[00:19:37.821 --> 00:19:42.461]  this toxic untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our
[00:19:42.461 --> 00:19:47.301]  drinking water reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and
[00:19:47.301 --> 00:19:52.741]  other disease with the Alexa pure Pro you can have clean drinking water and a
[00:19:52.741 --> 00:19:59.861]  remedy to this madness available now at Infowars.com
[00:19:59.861 --> 00:20:08.701]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:32.480]  so if your neighbor hypothetically one afternoon when your child was playing in your front
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:38.640]  yard say jumping through your sprinkler walked over to your child and punched him in the nose
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:43.600]  and broke their nose I think most men would come out of their front door and beat the
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:48.080]  living hell out of that person and when the police arrived you wouldn't go to jail they
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:54.860]  pat you on the back and say you did the right thing but when the globalists assault you
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:59.160]  with a non-experimental shot they told you it was experimental they'd already experimented
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:03.400]  with it and knew exactly what it would do causing a whole list of debilitating and
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:15.280]  lethal diseases neurological cardiovascular attacking the fertility systems reproductive
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:22.000]  systems we just sit here and we take it because it's such a big attack it's just hard to believe
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:30.000]  even though it's all around you so I saw a clip of Dr. Abdul Ali Mohammed explains the
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.520]  sudden death two-year mark and he gets it almost right from the studies we've covered
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:40.200]  probably 30 times here on air on average the mice died in two months they were all dead
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:45.880]  within six and a half months remember the exact date was six plus months and mice normally
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:50.720]  live a lot longer than that and they died of blood clots they died of strokes their
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:55.800]  ovaries their testicles got fried that's what it did so he's on a live discussion with people
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:01.600]  they say sir how do we detoxify doctor from the experimental shot and he says it's not
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:07.040]  experimental and that's a really good point he makes we call it experimental we were told
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:12.720]  as experimental then we're also told oh it was all tested and safe remember when you first saw
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:17.400]  it rolled out three years ago the pieces of paper that came with it normally with any drug whether
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:22.480]  it would be Ritalin or whether it would be Valium or whether it would be doxycycline or whether it
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:27.840]  would be heart medication for blood pressure whatever the prescription drug is it's got that
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.720]  sheet in it where it was made where it was studied what the side effects were it's like Bible paper
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:38.720]  big old giant sheet tiny words you got to read with a magnifying glass that was clear that was
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:43.760]  open but they told you safe and effective and it was tested the truth is it was tested to be deadly
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:50.760]  but depending on your genetic makeup and depending on how old you were depending on how I'm gonna
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:55.000]  shape you were in it had different effects on different people and remember around half the
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:02.360]  people got saline all over the world a unified program and then 40% on average got a watered
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:07.400]  down version that had some of the really bad stuff in it the nanotech the spike protein all of it
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:14.320]  and then depending on the country around 10% some countries 4% 6% there's government studies in
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:21.720]  Sweden others dr. Peter McCullough's talked about here on air it's in the studies now to give them
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:30.560]  a really strong shot to give you a big old juicy dose of death and that's what Ernest Ramirez jr.
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:37.120]  got it's called range finding so they can study and look at the different groups and also confuse
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:42.280]  people well why didn't you die but I had a heart attack or why didn't you I died but my wife did
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:51.840]  that's happening so let it sink in and understand it's a normal thing to get upset about this I
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:57.520]  had crew over the years say man you came into the show with almost no energy and once you don't
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:01.160]  already have all this energy are you snorting cocaine during the breaks the answer is no I
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:06.600]  hate stimulants other than coffee and some of the products we have are great the brain force
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:11.640]  plus the brain force ultra but no I'm fired up because they're killing us I mean if you could
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:15.960]  be sitting there after a long day's work at six o'clock in your you know kitchen looking out the
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:22.600]  back porch and if you saw a mountain lion this has happened in Texas and California jump the
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.800]  fence and try to eat your five-year-old that's playing on the jungle gym doesn't matter whether
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:32.680]  you weigh 170 pounds or 250 pounds most men or most women and it's happened are gonna run out
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:38.200]  they've grabbed butcher knives they've grabbed baseball bats sometimes barehanded women will go
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:44.320]  out and jump on a 250 pound mountain lion and start beating the hell out of it and it's happened
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:48.040]  in Big Bend Texas it's happened in Northern California it's happening work and and women
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:54.800]  will haul that lion off of their child well I'm here trying to hold this damn thing off my neck
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:25:00.600]  and off your neck I'm freaking pissed off man people don't take this serious we get eased in
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:12.280]  to taking being murdered and being attacked all day about a month ago my daughter about eight
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.400]  o'clock at night was brushing her teeth getting ready to go to bed my six-year-old and she's in
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:25.760]  my wife and I's bathroom and she's brushing her teeth and I'm sitting across the other sink brushing
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:32.200]  my teeth and I see right through my mirror while I brush my teeth a spider going up the mirror
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:38.960]  and I've already killed probably 20 brown recluses the last year at our house I've never seen so many
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:43.840]  particularly in that bathroom they come about the drain I put a new drain in the tiny hole so they
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:48.400]  won't quit quit doing it by that was in Texas knows about the scorpions come into the damn drains
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.840]  you'll be sitting there in bed turn the light on in the morning and there's a scorpion on the
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:58.800]  ceiling the scorpion won't kill you a brown recluse if we had a crew member bitten in October
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:03.960]  of last year by a brown recluse great incredible guy loved him so much for family privacy I'm not
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:12.320]  gonna say his name bitten by a brown recluse and then it caused a heart infection doesn't just
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:16.800]  eat holes in your leg and he dropped dead on Christmas morning loading presents in the car
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:27.800]  with his wife to go visit family across town we love him we love you Chris great guy the good die
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:37.840]  young 39 years old been here over a decade so I'm sitting there and I go son of a bitch I know
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:43.320]  the look of that spider all the way you know sink here in about 10 feet away my wife sink there's my
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:48.800]  sink there's bathtub right here I know I see a little that's a brown recluse they're dark brown
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:55.480]  fiddle on their back black legs dark brown legs and I and I'm not tough I could have picked up a
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:59.320]  piece of tissue I could have picked up something to hit it with but because it was by my daughter
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:04.560]  I didn't even think I ran right over and smashed that son of a bitch up against the mirror and it
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:11.240]  was a brown recluse and I don't like poison does it attacks your liver but at that point I went to
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:17.240]  the store that night and I got spider poison and I sprained it down the drain and in the shower
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:21.200]  entry and all that I told my daughter you can't come in there for a month stop trying to take
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.800]  showers in our bathroom she loves to be in that bathroom you go take one up and you know in your
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:32.960]  room and the point is is that when I saw the brown recluse there's one right there when I saw the
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:43.080]  brown recluse I didn't sit there and even think I went and I destroyed it because they're just as
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:50.360]  bad as a black widow and it killed one of our crew members on Christmas Day they did the autopsy and
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:56.320]  they said yeah it was a brown recluse bite rotted a big hole in his chin got an infection with the
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:02.760]  toxins in his arteries and ate his heart there they are that's a brown recluse kills way more
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:08.760]  than rattlesnakes and water moccasins and mountain lions combined and I'm off the rails here I'm gonna
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:14.160]  come back and get all the news now they're killing you but the shots are killing thousands of times
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:25.040]  what brown recluses do and it's being done on purpose and I just don't get it why people don't
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:34.320]  see a threat when it's in your face that's it going up the mirror I'm at the corner of the
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:41.080]  mirror I saw it walls when you and I was like another one well brown recluses are the least

[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:58.040]  allow in the water supply in some cases they add the water supply like fluoride
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:06.560]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:22.550]  I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see. I won't be much when you get through with me.
[00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:32.550]  He never gives up. He's Alex Jones. Broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas. Worldwide.
[00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:42.550]  Well I thought the day I met you, you were meek as a lamb. Just the kind to fit my dreams and plans.
[00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:51.550]  Now the pace we're living takes the wind from my sails and it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail.
[00:33:51.550 --> 00:34:04.550]  I've got a tiger. I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see. I won't be much when you get through with me.
[00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:14.550]  Well I'm a-losing weight and a-turning mighty pale. It looks like I've got a tiger by the tail.
[00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:24.550]  The globalists have got us by the tail. We know what they did. The word's spreading fast. Joe Rogan is completely red-pilled and on fire now.
[00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:30.550]  Don't need to tell you about our long dinner Saturday and what he said. You can just see him say it on air.
[00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:43.550]  You can see what Tucker's doing. What Andrew Tate's doing. What Russell Baran's doing. What everybody else is doing.
[00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:51.550]  And you guys. You're the reason. So don't ever forget that.
[00:34:51.550 --> 00:35:03.550]  I've got a tiger. I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see. I won't be much when you get through with me.
[00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:18.550]  You hear that Bill Gates? Well I'm a-losing weight and a-turning mighty pale. It looks like I've got a tiger by the tail.
[00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:22.550]  Coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas I'm your host Ellis Jones.
[00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:26.550]  All right let's get into what made me so mad. I mean a lot of this made me mad.
[00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:33.550]  And I really am working on it. And I pray a little good Lord to not make me go really crazy.
[00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:42.550]  But there's a healthy middle there. Thank God I do care. Thank God you care. Thank God we're not just rolling over.
[00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:50.550]  But kind of like a race car that's got 1,400 horsepower in it and you've got to run an ND 500.
[00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:58.550]  We're only halfway through the race right now and sure we can put the pedal to the metal and probably get a couple of laps ahead everybody.
[00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:05.550]  But our engine's going to blow. So we got to ease back and just stay in the lead.
[00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:14.550]  And only push the engine so far. And not get violent until we've taken control of the judiciary.
[00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:33.550]  And then we can bring redemption and retribution and vengeance that is the Lord's to the criminals that have committed this psychotic mass murder operation that would make Adolf Hitler blush.
[00:36:44.550 --> 00:37:13.550]  Let's start with this video. And then let's get into how they're murdering everybody.
[00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:21.550]  You like them killing you and your family? They're just getting started.
[00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:28.550]  So let's hear from this doctor talking about the studies which we've covered here. It's all real.
[00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:31.550]  And then let's get into what they're currently doing. Here it is.
[00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:40.550]  First and second dose. Is there anything that they can do to mitigate any risk associated with taking a vaccine?
[00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:48.550]  What can they do to protect themselves against what they've already done?
[00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:54.550]  OK, well, let me let me correct something that is a part of the disinformation campaign.
[00:37:54.550 --> 00:38:01.550]  Everybody has been told that this is an experimental vaccine, that it hasn't been tested and all of that.
[00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:04.550]  That's not true. It has been tested.
[00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:13.550]  When they tested the MRNA vaccine technology, they first tested it in humanized mice.
[00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:21.550]  And after two months, 100 percent of the mice had died.
[00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:27.550]  They did the same experiment injecting the MRNA technology into monkeys.
[00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:32.550]  And the same result, 100 percent death rate.
[00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:38.550]  And at autopsy, that MRNA was found in every organ throughout the body.
[00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:41.550]  So, again, we have to correct the record.
[00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:48.550]  They did an experiment to prove that the MRNA technology is 100 percent lethal.
[00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:59.550]  Now, if you translate mice life span into human life span terms, two months of a mouse's life is two years of a human's life.
[00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:14.550]  So if 100 percent of the mice died in two months, according to Dr. Judy Mikovits, according to Dr. Luke Montagnier, the Nobel Prize laureate, the people who have been vaccinated will be dead in two years.
[00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:22.550]  Now, to get to your question, can anything be done about what has already been proven to be the case?
[00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:27.550]  We should stop calling things by their wrong names.
[00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:33.550]  This is a biological weapon. The spike protein is a biological weapon to kill you.
[00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:44.550]  Now, people are going to say that Dr. Abdul Aleem Mohammed is wrong because they're going to say, well, I took the shot two years ago, I'm not dead.
[00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:49.550]  That's because 50 percent or 50 percent plus got saline on record.
[00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:52.550]  You got nothing but saltwater.
[00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:57.550]  On average, another 40 percent got a tiny amount of the poison.
[00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:00.550]  And that's what they mainly ship to blue states and blue cities.
[00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:06.550]  We've done the studies. We've had the statisticians on. We've had the insurance company experts on. We've shown you the studies, everything. It's a fact.
[00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:16.550]  But red areas in rural areas around the world got bombed with the real deal.
[00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:19.550]  And humans are a lot tougher than a mouse.
[00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:23.550]  Little secret about us is we're tough as nails.
[00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:27.550]  And poisons that work on most animals don't work on us.
[00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:29.550]  We're tough.
[00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:31.550]  We're tough. Been around a while.
[00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:33.550]  Pretty special.
[00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:37.550]  Think you figured out we probably didn't come from this planet.
[00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:42.550]  So this isn't our first rodeo read.
[00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:46.550]  The first book of the Bible, it describes it all going on before.
[00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:49.550]  Before God wiped it all out.
[00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:57.550]  And Plato said there were flying ships and automaton giant robots and people lived a thousand years.
[00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:02.550]  And then they started jacking with the DNA.
[00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:04.550]  It's been done before.
[00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:09.550]  What's the symbol of medicine over 4,000 years old from the Egyptians?
[00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:17.550]  It's a staff of life.
[00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:21.550]  With a double helix.
[00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:26.550]  And what is at the head of the double helix?
[00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:31.550]  Serpent.
[00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:37.550]  Not our first rodeo.
[00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:46.550]  So, told you months ago and weeks ago that they're about to roll out,
[00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:56.550]  that sorry, you heard of gluten intolerance.
[00:41:56.550 --> 00:42:03.550]  That started immediately in the late 1990s, accelerated in the early 2000s,
[00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:10.550]  when they began to spray the wheat when it was a week from harvest,
[00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:17.550]  when it was ripe, with Roundup, with glyphosate.
[00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:19.550]  It'll grow cancer.
[00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:21.550]  Well, it's a miracle grow, all right.
[00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:24.550]  Before they would just spread the cornfields and soybean fields, other fields,
[00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:27.550]  when they were first planting the seeds so weeds wouldn't crowd it out.
[00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:32.550]  And they'd engineer the corn and soybean where Roundup didn't hurt it.
[00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:33.550]  Everything else it killed.
[00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:36.550]  And it would run off in the water and kill the farmers, give them cancer,
[00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:39.550]  get in their well water.
[00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:40.550]  They made movies about all that.
[00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:44.550]  It's all admitted.
[00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:48.550]  But then they said, we'll spray the actual wheat because then fungus won't grow on it,
[00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:50.550]  so you've got a big dose of Roundup.
[00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:52.550]  You're not gluten intolerant.
[00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:54.550]  You're Roundup intolerant.
[00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:56.550]  Well, they got something a thousand times worse.
[00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:58.550]  They just dropped.
[00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:04.550]  I beg you to think about how important your word of mouth is
[00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:07.550]  and you sharing the articles and sharing the videos
[00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:10.550]  and telling people get the forbidden truth you're not supposed to find
[00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:12.550]  at InfoWars.com forward slash show

[00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:48.550]  Thank you so much for your support.
[00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:49.550]  Spread the word.
[00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:50.550]  Pray for the broadcast.
[00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:53.550]  And go now to InfoWarsStore.com
[00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:56.550]  and get great products that keep the tip of the spear in the fight.
[00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:03.550]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:05.550]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:09.550]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:11.550]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars,
[00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:14.550]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:18.550]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:20.550]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer
[00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:22.550]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:24.550]  five, six, seven days a week,
[00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:26.550]  it's really just incredible.
[00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:28.550]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew,
[00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:30.550]  I thank you for your past support.
[00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:34.550]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air
[00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:36.550]  if you do not support us.
[00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:37.550]  I know you spread the word.
[00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:38.550]  I know you pray for us.
[00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:39.550]  And that's wonderful.
[00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:40.550]  Keep doing it.
[00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:43.550]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:46.550]  And you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:48.550]  while at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:50.550]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:52.550]  actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:56.550]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com,
[00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:57.550]  our funding problems will be over.
[00:44:57.550 --> 00:44:59.550]  Please take action now.
[00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:03.550]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:05.550]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:09.550]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:11.550]  But when we talk about the crew at InfoWars,

[00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:22.550]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:26.550]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:28.550]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew,
[00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:30.550]  I thank you for your past support.

[00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:38.550]  I know you pray for us.
[00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:39.550]  And that's wonderful.
[00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:40.550]  Keep doing it.
[00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:43.550]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:52.550]  actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:56.550]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com,
[00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:57.550]  our funding problems will be over.
[00:45:57.550 --> 00:45:59.550]  Please take action now.
[00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:00.550]  As the years go by,
[00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:03.550]  it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:07.550]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress,
[00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:10.550]  you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids,
[00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:13.550]  vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:18.550]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:21.550]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation,
[00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:25.550]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system

[00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:33.550]  we've managed to make this powerhouse formula
[00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:36.550]  into a delicious, concentrated drink mix
[00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:38.550]  that's loaded with high-quality ingredients.

[00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:55.660]  Tell us about the products, how we support you, how we support all of ourselves, and the big event coming up.
[00:57:55.660 --> 00:58:01.660]  Well, yeah, let's, the first one, you obviously can go to mypillow.com, use that promo code ALEX,
[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:10.660]  and you can get all these great discounts on all of our products, and just by visiting this site, you're gonna get a $20 free gift emailed to you immediately.
[00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:19.660]  And there's the biggest special we have right now, the 20 year anniversary MyPillow for 1998 for the queen size, normally $69.98.
[00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:26.660]  We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love to invest, producing and making the MyPillow.
[00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:36.660]  And the model of businessmen and women with can-do know-how, using the money for Americana freedom to fight the globalists is what they fear.
[00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:43.660]  That's what the debanking is about, that's what the financial attacks are about, that's why we've got a rush to support MyPillow.com and InfoWars.com,
[00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:47.660]  plus their great products at both places, because we are the tip of the spear.
[00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:55.660]  InfoWars is a one-of-a-kind operation, and so please, go to InfoWars store and just make a donation.
[00:58:55.660 --> 00:59:05.660]  And you can make it one time or recurring, you have a little profile there, cancelling time, every 15 days, every month, every 3 months, every 6 months, up to 9 months.
[00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:12.660]  You can go in and every month or every week, whenever you want, you program it, you just click it, and then you decide when you want to make a donation.
[00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:19.660]  So please do that as well, that way we get 95% of it after credit card fees, instead of making 20, 30, 40% like we do on the products.
[00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:22.660]  But these really are amazing products, the big July 4th sale is going on right now.
[00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:25.660]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the new world order.
[00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:28.660]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated, people are listening more than ever.
[00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:33.660]  But in this major recession, going into depression, and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:39.660]  I know times are tough, so thank you for your support, but whatever you do, pray for the broadcast, and share the articles and the videos.
[00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:43.660]  That you can do for free, and that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:48.660]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:49.660]  God bless you.
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:56.660]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:59:56.660 --> 01:00:10.660]  I respect China's achievements, which are tremendous over the last, over 40 years.
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:16.660]  The Chinese model is certainly a very attractive model for quite a number of countries.
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:23.660]  Real super hardcore evil demons have taken over, and they've already got China and a billion and a half people.
[01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:29.660]  I'm here to meet one of the 10 million people who've seen the dark side of the social credit system.
[01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:32.660]  Investigative journalist, Leo Hu.
[01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:41.660]  His poor social credit rating has shut down his travel options, and confined him to effective house arrest in Chongqing.
[01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:43.660]  WeChat started as a messaging app.
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:48.660]  Then it transformed into Chinese Facebook, and then it added a ride hailing service, similar to Uber to its platform.
[01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:52.660]  And then it added banking services to its platform, and now you can use it as an ID.
[01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:58.660]  This will make your life very convenient, but at the same time, it also becomes very convenient for state security to track you.
[01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:01.660]  To combat message interceptions, they talk through emojis.
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:04.660]  A half fallen rose means someone has been arrested.
[01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:06.660]  A dark moon means they're going to prison camps.
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:10.660]  A sun emoji means they are alive, and a flower means they have been released.
[01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:15.660]  China is positioning itself to lead the world in artificial intelligence.
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:19.660]  Surveillance technology is a key proving ground.
[01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:27.660]  Facial recognition, body scanning, and geo-tracking, matched with your personal data and online behavior,
[01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:33.660]  will power the social credit system, leaving no dark corner to hide in.
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:37.660]  And you can say, well this is just innovation, but it's not innovation the way it's being done.
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:41.660]  It's absolute tyranny, and now it's here, and guess who created the bill?
[01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:48.660]  Senator Blumenthal, who quarterbacks the government operations against me on record with the Carnegie Endowment and the CIA.
[01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:57.660]  This bill is designed to make sure that they have your home address before you can actually post about anything on the internet.
[01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:00.660]  The bill is Senate Bill 1409.
[01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:03.660]  Forty senators have sponsored it, Republicans and Democrats.
[01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:05.660]  This isn't a left or right issue.
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:07.660]  This is a speech issue.
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:12.660]  And they call the bill the Kids Online Safety Act, or COSA for short.
[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:17.660]  But in reality, this is some garbage to make sure that they know where you live when you post.
[01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:24.660]  Whether you're a conservative or a liberal or whatever you are, there are so many people going along with the New World Order
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:30.660]  who even know it's real, but they think, well I'll just go along with it, and I'll have a better lifestyle if I go along with it.
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:31.660]  No.
[01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:38.660]  We see what is happening in China right now with the social credit score, where the government is monitoring and surveilling all the people
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:40.660]  from the beginning to end.
[01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:46.660]  Everything that they do, everything, everywhere where they walk, they control everything and they watch everything.
[01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:48.660]  This is the example of a tyranny.
[01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:54.660]  When the government knows everything about you, where you go, what you eat, where you enter, that's a tyrannical system.
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:59.660]  And we've seen this system being implemented right now under the leadership of Ursula von der Leyen,
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:02.660]  slowly but surely in the European Union.
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:04.660]  The green certificate was just the first step.
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:08.660]  There are a few more proposals right now under debate in the parliament.
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:17.660]  All these things that are creating a system that will monitor, control, supervise, and condition the rights of all the European citizens.
[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:22.660]  The heart of the Mark of the Beast system is a worldwide internet ID.
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:24.660]  The UN has already standardized it.
[01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:26.660]  Communist China standardized it.
[01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:34.660]  And it's the internet ID that's tied to your smartphone, your smart devices, your car, your ability to get on airplanes, get hotels, have insurance, have a job.
[01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:43.660]  And then that's tied to your carbon tax, your vaccine passport tax that operates against its orders from your social credit score.
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:52.660]  The foundation and the structure of the entire system is based on the internet ID that is then tied to your digital ID.
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:04:02.660]  Jeff Bezos' Amazon-owned Whole Foods is announcing worldwide, in the next three months, they're putting palm scanners in to be able to buy and sell.
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:09.660]  And in many Whole Foods and other grocery stores in Europe, they're already making you scan your phone or your hand to get into the grocery stores,
[01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:13.660]  not just Whole Paycheck, as Whole Foods is known.
[01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:20.660]  So this has already been set up for a long time.
[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:23.660]  Now they're getting ready to go, oh, you didn't know?
[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:27.660]  Under law, there's a whole history of what you search and what you do and where you go.
[01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:32.660]  We're talking about a republic that we're losing, and it's being destroyed by design.
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:36.660]  And now global corporations think we're a bunch of dumb animals.
[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:45.660]  And they'll incentivize accepting the world government, cashless society, programmable central bank digital currencies and ESGs and the rest of them.
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:54.660]  Because we get little credits and little prizes up front to be the first suckers to grease the skids over the cliff into Hades.
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:05:04.660]  Tell us about the products, how we support you, how we support all of ourselves and the big event coming up.
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:06.660]  Well, yeah, that's the first one.
[01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:14.660]  You obviously can go to MyPillow.com, use that promo code Alex, and you can get all these great discounts on all of our products.
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:19.660]  And just by visiting this site, you're going to get a $20 free gift emailed to you immediately.
[01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:28.660]  And there's the biggest special we have right now, the 20-year anniversary MyPillow for 1998 for the queen size, normally $69.98.
[01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:35.660]  We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love to invest, producing and making the MyPillow.
[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:45.660]  And the model of businessmen and women with can-do know-how using the money for Americana freedom to fight the globalists is what they fear.
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:46.660]  That's what the debanking is about.
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:48.660]  That's what the financial attacks are about.
[01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:56.660]  That's why we've got to rush to support MyPillow.com and InfoWars.com, plus their great products in both places, because we are the tip of the spear.
[01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:12.660]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:18.660]  Live from Austin, Texas, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:39.660]  Every medical system in the modern world, not just in the United States, is under the control of the globalist big bank, Carnegie, Ford, IBM combine that Bill Gates is the front man for when he's not hanging out with Jeffrey Epstein trying to compromise scientists.
[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:46.660]  And so now alpha-gals everywhere, and a half million Americans can't eat meat all of a sudden, and there's ticks everywhere.
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:51.660]  Even in countries that don't have it, suddenly the tick bit them and they can't eat meat anymore.
[01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:57.660]  And here's the headlines, Bill Gates funds research in genetically engineered cattle ticks.
[01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:05.660]  Now at least 403,000 Americans have red meat allergies from alpha-gal syndrome caused by tick bites.
[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:15.660]  What I showed you yesterday, the FDA and CDC's own website admitting that vaccines contain alpha-gal and are causing it in their studies.
[01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:21.660]  But that's on the FDA and CDC websites, that's not on the news.
[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:24.660]  Isn't that sweet?
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:31.660]  And then we've got all this other news, monkey virus DNA found in COVID-19 shots.
[01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:43.660]  And that's according to people that run the government programs like Dr. Stephen E. Greer, microbiologist Kevin McKeren.
[01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:48.660]  Turns out the spike protein mRNA are not the only hazards of these injections.
[01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:55.660]  His team discovered shimian virus 40, SV40, in the shots.
[01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:58.660]  In the shots.
[01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:03.660]  You hear that?
[01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:12.660]  CCMB taps green monkey to culture virus, make COVID vaccine, there's the Times of India.
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:21.660]  So they admit they used the monkeys that are infected with this to make these vaccines, but it's okay.
[01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:25.660]  Uganda acquires green monkey, sells for COVID-19 vaccine development.
[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:29.660]  What ingredients for the COVID-19 vaccine?
[01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:32.660]  Pfizer BioNTech vaccine.
[01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:37.660]  It's all right here, we're showing you the actual documents.
[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:46.660]  And here's the non-food products, according to the CDC and FDA, that may contain alpha-gal.
[01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:55.660]  Bovine extract used in all these different products.
[01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:57.660]  Here's from the CDC.
[01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:04.660]  Alpha-gal in the shots.
[01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:07.660]  The next pandemic could spring from a U.S. meat supply.
[01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:10.660]  New report finds USA Today.
[01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:13.660]  Products that may contain alpha-gal.
[01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:18.660]  Alpha-gal syndrome is a type of food allergy.
[01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:23.660]  It makes people allergic to red meat and other products made from mammals.
[01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:27.660]  They're making us allergic to what we eat and allergic to ourselves.
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:35.660]  And here is an overhead shot of the CDC vaccine expert summary, appendix B.
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:38.660]  Experts include U.S. vaccines by vaccine.
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:41.660]  What has alpha-gal in it?
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:50.660]  And it lists all these different vaccines that have the alpha-gal in them.
[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:56.660]  Shot, after shot, after shot, after shot, after shot, after shot.
[01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:03.660]  After shot, after shot, after shot, after shot, after shot, after shot, after shot.
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:06.660]  I mean, you want me to read these off to you?
[01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:08.660]  Take about five minutes.
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:10.660]  Take about five minutes.
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:16.660]  Why don't you just type that in and go to the CDC website for yourself?
[01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:19.660]  It's on the FDA website, too.
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:23.660]  Oh, but Snopes says it's not true.
[01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:32.660]  Prevalence of alpha-gal, IgE, and mammalian meat allergy in COVID-19 vaccines study.
[01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:36.660]  That's out of PubMed.
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:40.660]  Here's Health and Human Services.
[01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:42.660]  Here's another one.
[01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:50.660]  The results support the proposal of developing interventions such as probiotics based on commercial bacteria
[01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:58.660]  with gal epitomes to modify the mitochondria, the microbiota,
[01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:05.660]  and increase gal-induced protective immune response and reduce severity to COVID-19.
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:15.660]  Increase a gal-induced protective immune response and reduce severity of COVID-19.
[01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:25.660]  Your body is attacking a protein that's in you and that it's in me.
[01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:29.660]  Wow.
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:34.660]  See what I'm talking about now?
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:42.660]  Cancer viruses, cow protein, all of it being injected into you,
[01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:48.660]  and old Billy Boys genetically modifying the ticks and releasing them,
[01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:55.660]  and the mosquitoes and releasing them to protect us, of course.
[01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:58.660]  Isn't that darling?
[01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:04.660]  It really is, darling.
[01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:10.660]  Bill Gates is such a nice, nice man.
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:16.660]  The meat of the matter, understanding and managing alpha-gal syndrome.
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:25.660]  And even if you don't take the shots, you can be shed on and become allergic to beef and lamb
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:37.660]  because they're red meat or other venisons like white tail deer or mule deer or antelope or axis deer.
[01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:39.660]  Any red meat.
[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:44.660]  And they're all over the news laughing confidently.
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:46.660]  Soon you're not going to be eating red meat.
[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:48.660]  You're going to be eating bugs.
[01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:50.660]  And we're like, you're crazy, man.
[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:53.660]  You're never going to get us to stop eating delicious cheeseburgers.
[01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:54.660]  And they said, really?
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:57.660]  Hold my beer, you bastards.
[01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:07.660]  Oh my goodness, isn't it sweet?
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:14.660]  Well, I'm done talking about that now for today.
[01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:16.660]  Kind of a big deal.
[01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:21.660]  You know, injecting you with a cow protein in the shot.
[01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:30.660]  In their own government documents saying we're going to cause an autoimmune response to alpha-gal.
[01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:39.660]  When alpha-gal is exactly what the spike protein is made out of.
[01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:43.660]  And now we get the picture.
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:47.660]  Some people it grows in out of control, embeds itself in the cells,
[01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:52.660]  your body then eats holes in your arteries and your capillaries and your veins and your brain and your lungs.
[01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:55.660]  And then some people get sterilized or both.
[01:13:56.660 --> 01:13:57.660]  Some people have a heart attack.
[01:13:58.660 --> 01:13:59.660]  Some get myocarditis.
[01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:01.660]  Some get a stroke.
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:03.660]  It's like Oprah goes, you get a car, you get a car.
[01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:05.660]  You get a blood clot.
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:07.660]  You get a stroke.
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:09.660]  You get a heart attack.
[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:11.660]  You get myocarditis.
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:14.660]  You get autoimmune disease.
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:17.660]  How sweet it is.
[01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:22.660]  And then it's not uniform because half the people aren't even giving it.
[01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:25.660]  The other 40% are giving a watered down version.
[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:29.660]  It's only 10% or less that get the special sauce.
[01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:33.660]  And you know when they pick you up during a financial collapse.
[01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:36.660]  They take you away to a FEMA center because you're protesting lockdown.
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:38.660]  They say all the world are going to do.
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:40.660]  It's all unified you and run.
[01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:46.660]  You just know that the political dissidents are going to get the special juicy hot shot.
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:53.660]  And since it kills you on average in a couple months or a couple years depending on your physiology.
[01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:57.660]  Well they let you out in a few weeks out of the camp.
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:02.660]  And then you go back home and you die later.
[01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:06.660]  Because if they had you in camp shooting you, the jail guards would say this is wrong.
[01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:11.660]  But if it's a ventilator killing you or you're dying of the shot months or years later.
[01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:13.660]  It's all so trendy.
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:16.660]  It's all so liberal.
[01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:21.660]  So you have been warned.
[01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:27.660]  And remember big tech and the intelligence agencies and the whole system are going to work around the clock.
[01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:32.660]  To make sure you didn't just get the last hour of information.
[01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:38.660]  To make sure they can quietly strangle you to death with these weapons.
[01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:39.660]  You may want to roll over and die.
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:41.660]  I don't.
[01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:43.660]  But I know this.
[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:45.660]  God's watching.
[01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:48.660]  And if we don't stand up for the children and stop this.
[01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:50.660]  It's on our souls.
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:52.660]  We'll be back.
[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:54.660]  Stay with us.
[01:15:56.660 --> 01:15:58.660]  For everything the globalists hit us with.
[01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:01.660]  God through mother nature has given us the answer.
[01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:03.660]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil.
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:05.660]  Full spectrum CBD oil.
[01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:06.660]  The incredible things it does for your nerves.
[01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:08.660]  Your brain.
[01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:10.660]  Now your entire physiological system.

[01:18:56.660 --> 01:18:57.660]  About to sell out.
[01:18:58.660 --> 01:18:59.660]  You wanted to plug RainForce.
[01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:01.660]  Do you like RainForce?
[01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:03.660]  Yeah.
[01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:05.660]  So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:07.660]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:09.660]  Four books with Dr. Judy Mykovitz.
[01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:11.660]  Four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers.
[01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:13.660]  And now two books with Alex Jones.
[01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:15.660]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:17.660]  What I always need is I always need
[01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:19.660]  some sort of boost in the morning.
[01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:21.660]  And so you know I try to exercise.
[01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:23.660]  Eat well.
[01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:25.660]  The only compound that makes a difference
[01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:27.660]  is RainForce.
[01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:29.660]  I'll take RainForce in the morning
[01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:31.660]  right before I go to my computer.
[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:33.660]  And I'm good for the next four or five hours
[01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:35.660]  writing a whole lot of stuff.
[01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:37.660]  So it really is true that RainForce
[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:39.660]  is something I use every day.
[01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:41.660]  And it helps me with my writing.
[01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:43.660]  Alright we love you.
[01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:45.660]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:47.660]  Get your RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra
[01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:49.660]  and TurboForce at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:51.660]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[01:19:54.660 --> 01:19:55.660]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:07.610 --> 01:20:33.610]  We've got Blair White in studio for an hour and a half coming up, start of the next segment.
[01:20:33.610 --> 01:20:41.610]  We're going to go all into the transgenderism, transhumanism, and more with Blair, who is a very smart, nice person who I like and who is a friend of mine.
[01:20:41.610 --> 01:20:47.610]  And we'll dispel all the disinformation out there or that I'm a hypocrite. I've never been a hypocrite about this.
[01:20:47.610 --> 01:20:53.610]  I don't hate transgender people. I don't hate gay people or anybody. I hate heterosexuals, homosexuals that go after children.
[01:20:53.610 --> 01:20:58.610]  And I hate people that go after children and try to mutilate them. And so does Blair.
[01:20:58.610 --> 01:21:02.610]  So let's be clear where I've always stood and who I am. And I've never been a hypocrite about it.
[01:21:02.610 --> 01:21:09.610]  I love everybody as long as they don't attack children. But I'll also tell them I think they're doing something that's destructive.
[01:21:09.610 --> 01:21:13.610]  And I've done plenty in my life. I'm not throwing stones in glass houses here.
[01:21:13.610 --> 01:21:18.610]  So we'll talk to Blair, in-depth discussion coming up. Looking forward to it.
[01:21:18.610 --> 01:21:26.610]  Okay, so let's talk turkey here. I went into the press conference Tuesday with Stephen Crowder.
[01:21:26.610 --> 01:21:30.610]  It was a big deal, made a lot of headlines. Crowder was attacked all over the news after it.
[01:21:31.610 --> 01:21:35.610]  And I want to explain why this is so important and why it's a game changer. I want people to listen to me carefully.
[01:21:35.610 --> 01:21:39.610]  Because I don't say things I don't mean. I don't hype things.
[01:21:39.610 --> 01:21:43.610]  We have incredible things going on that are amazing. They hype themselves.
[01:21:43.610 --> 01:21:52.610]  So let me explain something here. Infowars.com and this whole show is barely in the black, but we're going through bankruptcy.
[01:21:52.610 --> 01:21:55.610]  People thought I'd be shut down a year ago. You thought, well, he's gone.
[01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:58.610]  And support went down when I declared bankruptcy.
[01:21:58.610 --> 01:22:04.610]  Even though I went on air and I said it's chapter 11, sub-chapter 5, emergency organization.
[01:22:04.610 --> 01:22:08.610]  And if we go through this successfully, which is happening, had big court victories last Tuesday in court.
[01:22:08.610 --> 01:22:11.610]  Because this is not a kangaroo court. This is a real judge.
[01:22:11.610 --> 01:22:17.610]  The other side's apoplectic. This is going to stay on the air indefinitely because of your support.
[01:22:17.610 --> 01:22:20.610]  But the real chink in the armor is me.
[01:22:21.610 --> 01:22:26.610]  My lawyers, who are great bankruptcy lawyers, said you're going to lose in this kangaroo court in Connecticut.
[01:22:26.610 --> 01:22:31.610]  You need to declare bankruptcy now. But I didn't. The company did before that.
[01:22:31.610 --> 01:22:40.610]  So when they created that billion and a half dollars, at that level, it becomes a whole other ball of wax on dischargeability.
[01:22:40.610 --> 01:22:44.610]  But at the end of the day, they can't take your house or car in Texas.
[01:22:44.610 --> 01:22:48.610]  So I don't even care about money. I care about truth and justice and freedom.
[01:22:48.610 --> 01:22:51.610]  Money's just a tool to fight tyranny. So I'm okay there.
[01:22:51.610 --> 01:22:57.610]  Except for the fact that the court ruled I got to pay half the legal bills for free speech systems.
[01:22:57.610 --> 01:23:02.610]  And because of some cannery and some stuff going on internally that I'm not going to get into on air at this time,
[01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:08.610]  I went and spent my last $900,000 a year ago to buy the platinum line of products.
[01:23:08.610 --> 01:23:14.610]  And they're great products. But that's all held up and the money from that's held up.
[01:23:15.610 --> 01:23:20.610]  And so I'm unable to even get that to pay the bills. And I'm completely out of money.
[01:23:20.610 --> 01:23:24.610]  In fact, I'm upside down. I'm having to fight all these appeals.
[01:23:24.610 --> 01:23:27.610]  I'm having to pay for the bankruptcy. I'm having to do everything.
[01:23:27.610 --> 01:23:32.610]  So the cheek in the armor is that Alex Jones is out of money.
[01:23:32.610 --> 01:23:42.610]  But the folks doing our bankruptcy and doing a great job, they've approved me being able to do a once a week show
[01:23:42.610 --> 01:23:45.610]  that's going to end up being at least an hour of the show a day.
[01:23:45.610 --> 01:23:52.610]  And reporters and crew and expanding when it's successful, which it already is on Crowder's end.
[01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:56.610]  And then part of that money goes to Alex Jones.
[01:23:56.610 --> 01:24:01.610]  So when you go to jonescrowder.com, we'll put the full screen for you.
[01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:08.610]  That takes you right to the signup page to get eight different talk show hosts that they have.
[01:24:08.610 --> 01:24:13.610]  We have a gun expert, Steven Crowder, all his programs, Brian Kellen.
[01:24:13.610 --> 01:24:20.610]  The list goes on and on. Nick DiPaolo and other shows they're adding to the Hodge twins, you name it.
[01:24:20.610 --> 01:24:27.610]  You will get one membership. But when you buy it at with one click at jonescrowder.com,
[01:24:27.610 --> 01:24:34.610]  the majority of the money goes to free speech systems to keep us on air.
[01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:37.610]  And part of it then goes to me.
[01:24:37.610 --> 01:24:40.610]  So you can go watch Crowder and all his shows right now.
[01:24:40.610 --> 01:24:42.610]  I'll do my first three hour special show next week.
[01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:45.610]  And that's what I'm finally going to do, the PowerPoints, the live events.
[01:24:45.610 --> 01:24:49.610]  It's not going to be one show a week, folks. It's going to be so much.
[01:24:49.610 --> 01:24:51.610]  You can grab clips out of it, share. It's going to be great.
[01:24:51.610 --> 01:24:56.610]  And I'm going to do it where part of the show is free, part of the show is subscription.
[01:24:56.610 --> 01:24:58.610]  And this is where you're funding the tip of the spear.
[01:24:58.610 --> 01:25:02.610]  So it keeps us on air. It lets me be able to continue to fight.
[01:25:02.610 --> 01:25:05.610]  And Steven has a vision. He's a great guy.
[01:25:05.610 --> 01:25:08.610]  He's under attack to have hundreds of shows.
[01:25:08.610 --> 01:25:13.610]  And we're partnering with Rumble. That is the only main challenge now to YouTube
[01:25:13.610 --> 01:25:19.610]  and is getting incredible success with everybody from I mean,
[01:25:19.610 --> 01:25:28.610]  the list goes on and on from the Tate brothers to Dan Bongino to Crowder to so many.
[01:25:29.610 --> 01:25:34.610]  I mean, Crowder routinely has three, four million viewers a day on Rumble alone.
[01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:38.610]  And they're unable to censor that going into this key campaign season
[01:25:38.610 --> 01:25:40.610]  when you know they're going to go crazy with the censorship.
[01:25:40.610 --> 01:25:44.610]  So you want us to build an alternate internet? You want us to build an infrastructure?
[01:25:44.610 --> 01:25:47.610]  We've got it. We're the ones that have delivered. Thanks for your support.
[01:25:47.610 --> 01:25:49.610]  We've delivered together.
[01:25:49.610 --> 01:25:55.610]  So now is the time to go to jonescrowder.com,
[01:25:56.610 --> 01:25:59.610]  right to that link and to become a member.
[01:25:59.610 --> 01:26:03.610]  Comes out to like eight bucks a month. Get a year membership.
[01:26:03.610 --> 01:26:06.610]  Get one free when you sign up with promo code Alex.
[01:26:06.610 --> 01:26:09.610]  This is beyond critical. You want us to stay on air?
[01:26:09.610 --> 01:26:11.610]  You want us to fight? You want us to win?
[01:26:11.610 --> 01:26:13.610]  You want to not lay down on the world order?
[01:26:13.610 --> 01:26:18.610]  Everyone listening to me must make the decision if you want to win this fight
[01:26:18.610 --> 01:26:22.610]  to go to jonescrowder.com right now.
[01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:24.610]  I could do another GoFundMe with Obanis there.
[01:26:24.610 --> 01:26:28.610]  I could do another Give Sim Go and get the money I need from straight donations
[01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:30.610]  to pay my legal bills.
[01:26:30.610 --> 01:26:36.610]  But I'd rather you get all the eight shows, I guess nine shows that I've been added
[01:26:36.610 --> 01:26:40.610]  and then it always takes me longer to do what I'm going to say,
[01:26:40.610 --> 01:26:42.610]  but I always do what I'm going to say.
[01:26:42.610 --> 01:26:45.610]  I have one of the most popular shows we do that we never do
[01:26:45.610 --> 01:26:48.610]  because of time and energy and crew, but that's what this is going to fund
[01:26:49.610 --> 01:26:54.610]  is I'm going to start doing PowerPoints walking around on the big screen
[01:26:54.610 --> 01:26:57.610]  like an Apple presentation and devastating.
[01:26:57.610 --> 01:27:00.610]  I'm going to start doing events with members.
[01:27:00.610 --> 01:27:05.610]  I'm going to start doing a reality show that's a real reality show.
[01:27:05.610 --> 01:27:10.610]  We've got so much planned here where a portion of the money goes for crew
[01:27:10.610 --> 01:27:14.610]  and infrastructure and more shows, a portion goes to fund the infrastructure
[01:27:14.610 --> 01:27:19.610]  and free speech, and then a portion goes to fund yours truly
[01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:22.610]  because I'm happy if I can pay my grocery bills and have insurance
[01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:23.610]  and a car and a house.
[01:27:23.610 --> 01:27:25.610]  I don't care past that.
[01:27:25.610 --> 01:27:28.610]  I don't measure myself by how much money I got in the bank,
[01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:30.610]  but I put everything I've got in this fight.
[01:27:30.610 --> 01:27:36.610]  So when you go to jonescrowder.com and you become a member,
[01:27:36.610 --> 01:27:41.610]  the promo code is free month, you are literally on the front lines of the fight
[01:27:41.610 --> 01:27:45.610]  just as important as I am or Steven Crowder is.
[01:27:45.610 --> 01:27:48.610]  Everybody else over the years has been scared.
[01:27:48.610 --> 01:27:51.610]  Then the worm turned about three or four months ago,
[01:27:51.610 --> 01:27:58.610]  and all the major outlets other than Daily Wire offered me a job
[01:27:58.610 --> 01:28:00.610]  and wanted to work with me and have me do a show with them.
[01:28:00.610 --> 01:28:04.610]  But I went with Crowder because he wanted to do this a year ago
[01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:07.610]  and told me he was going to leave the blaze and told me about his vision
[01:28:07.610 --> 01:28:10.610]  and wasn't scared to have a son and wasn't scared to get censored
[01:28:10.610 --> 01:28:11.610]  because he did it.
[01:28:11.610 --> 01:28:12.610]  So I like Steven.
[01:28:12.610 --> 01:28:13.610]  He lives right here in Texas.
[01:28:13.610 --> 01:28:14.610]  We're working with him.
[01:28:14.610 --> 01:28:16.610]  InfoWars goes on.
[01:28:16.610 --> 01:28:17.610]  We're going to expand with this.
[01:28:17.610 --> 01:28:19.610]  It funds InfoWars.
[01:28:19.610 --> 01:28:23.610]  It funds Crowder creating an infrastructure and a team for me
[01:28:23.610 --> 01:28:27.610]  that's totally separate and new that will interface with my regular team,
[01:28:27.610 --> 01:28:29.610]  and it funds InfoWars.
[01:28:29.610 --> 01:28:32.610]  So if you want us to stay in the fight, I'm asking for your help right now.
[01:28:32.610 --> 01:28:34.610]  I'm asking you from the bottom of my heart,

[01:30:57.610 --> 01:31:00.610]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil,
[01:31:00.610 --> 01:31:04.610]  which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[01:31:04.610 --> 01:31:09.610]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element,
[01:31:09.610 --> 01:31:13.610]  which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[01:31:13.610 --> 01:31:16.610]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[01:31:16.610 --> 01:31:19.610]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[01:31:19.610 --> 01:31:24.610]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics
[01:31:24.610 --> 01:31:28.610]  that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[01:31:28.610 --> 01:31:33.610]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day,
[01:31:33.610 --> 01:31:38.610]  derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[01:31:38.610 --> 01:31:44.610]  Our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[01:31:44.610 --> 01:31:46.610]  Pure, nascent iodine.
[01:31:46.610 --> 01:31:50.610]  Stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[01:31:50.610 --> 01:31:53.610]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism,

[01:31:57.610 --> 01:32:02.610]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?
[01:32:02.610 --> 01:32:04.610]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[01:32:04.610 --> 01:32:06.610]  So let me get this straight.
[01:32:06.610 --> 01:32:09.610]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document
[01:32:09.610 --> 01:32:11.610]  showing that during the Obama administration,
[01:32:11.610 --> 01:32:14.610]  Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son Hunter
[01:32:14.610 --> 01:32:18.610]  to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption,
[01:32:18.610 --> 01:32:20.610]  an event that Donald Trump looked into,
[01:32:20.610 --> 01:32:23.610]  sparking the first impeachment and forcing the arming of Ukraine,
[01:32:23.610 --> 01:32:26.610]  in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia.
[01:32:26.610 --> 01:32:28.610]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop,
[01:32:28.610 --> 01:32:30.610]  which the FBI also had,
[01:32:30.610 --> 01:32:32.610]  but that they swore was Russian disinformation
[01:32:32.610 --> 01:32:36.610]  and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign,
[01:32:36.610 --> 01:32:40.610]  all while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents
[01:32:40.610 --> 01:32:44.610]  despite the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016
[01:32:44.610 --> 01:32:48.610]  when they were simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump
[01:32:48.610 --> 01:32:52.610]  using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[01:32:52.610 --> 01:32:54.610]  Do I have that all straight?
[01:32:57.740 --> 01:33:27.740]  I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't
[01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:57.740]  know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
[01:33:57.740 --> 01:34:27.740]  I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I
[01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:57.740]  don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don
[01:34:57.740 --> 01:35:27.740]  know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
[01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:57.340]  today. I don't remember the details more than eight years ago that I first became aware of Blair White, when she exploded onto YouTube. And Blair said, Hey, leftist and pedophiles don't speak for quote, transgenders. And I remember interviewing Blair White.
[01:35:57.740 --> 01:36:27.740]  And Blair's been on the show many times over the years. I've been on Blair's show a few times as well. In fact, it was the only show I ever got truly drunk on and passed out on. And so Blair's here for the next hour and a half. I appreciate fellow Austinite now, lived here a few years. Great to have you here. You and Michael Malice and Joe Rogan, you know, co hosting doing a great job. We co hosted here about a year ago with the Tim Pool. That was amazing. So fun. As I just want to say this up front. There are people that watch this show. And we
[01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:52.940]  gave a big issue a few months ago saying Jones is a hypocrite. He hates transgender people. He hates gay people. He hates everybody. But then he's nice to wear white. That's all a media lie. I don't care if you're heterosexual, homosexual, whatever you are, black, white, old, young, as long as you're not a communist, as long as you're not targeting children. And Blair, since I've known Blair eight years was speaking up about this targeting that Blair's a good person
[01:36:53.099 --> 01:37:03.500]  before anyone else, by the way, like before it was a national topic before, you know, every headline was about trans kids in which states are banning whatever I was talking about this forever ago. So
[01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:16.620]  so let's talk about you instead of me ranting here. I just want to say you've been my friend. You know, good friends that you moved to Austin, but but but I had you on. I was lucky to have you as one of the first first people ever interview you really?
[01:37:17.059 --> 01:37:44.780]  Yeah, I think literally the first actually you had me on eight years ago, and it was remote. So this is my first time actually in studio. Beautiful studio. Yeah. So and the reason why I've always enjoyed, you know, filming stuff with you or we did an event like at the Vulcan on Sixth Street here in Austin is because first of all, I'm loyal to people who are loyal to me to me and people send me clips all the time of you defending me and, you know, people saying crazy shit about me. Can I swear on here?
[01:37:45.139 --> 01:37:56.580]  Yes, I can. Yeah, it's important. So you know, it's like, I defend you too, because you're right. It is a media lie that you're this hateful person. You know, I've never seen it. And I've known you for a couple years.
[01:37:56.660 --> 01:38:13.740]  Well, the bottom line is you're not hurting anybody. And you're not like Big Pharma targeting kids with shots or any of this. So before we get into all the news and things that are happening, tell us about yourself and your journey in your life, politically, culturally, spiritually, and where you are now. And just your view on the world today.
[01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:43.420]  Yeah, so I'm 29 years old. And I transitioned nine years ago. And I've been on YouTube for about eight years. And it's been really sort of my entire purpose of my career is to stop the medicalization of children, among other things, you know, I talk about politics in general, but one of the things I'm most passionate about is this Big Pharma takeover of, you know, a very tiny community, which is now exploding due to the fact that it's not actual
[01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:59.580]  trans people, and they're convincing kids to do this shit. But, you know, that's been a huge main focus. But other than that, I don't know, I'm from California, Austinite now, that was one of the best decisions in my life to move to Texas. And, yeah, yeah, just here.
[01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:29.580]  Okay. Well, I mean, let's just let's just get this out on the table. Let's do it. The the system will grab on to to to any group or any organization. But the big elephant in the room is this, we would always hear 20 years ago, it's not a decision. It's biological that people are gay. And, and so I decided to research that. And it's always happened in history. And it's gone on every culture. And we don't hate anybody. As long as, you know, consenting adults, it doesn't matter to us, it doesn't matter to anybody, it doesn't matter to anybody, it doesn't matter to anybody, it doesn't matter to anybody, it doesn't matter to anybody, it doesn't matter to anybody, it doesn't matter to anybody, it doesn't matter to anybody, it doesn't matter to anybody, it doesn't matter to anybody, it doesn't matter to anybody, it doesn't matter to anybody, it doesn't matter to anybody, it doesn't matter to anybody,
[01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:59.580]  it doesn't mean we're not passing some religious judgment. I'm not, I'm not, all I'm saying is, we're not attacking people for for decisions they've made, that's up for God to decide. But we know the chemicals in the water and the food are affecting embryos in their mothers, particularly in the first few weeks, that are changing, at least in brain physiology, the minds of children. And it changes the minds of frogs, fish, other mammals. So So it
[01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:29.580]  really is true that that's going on. And that that is that is happening. And so when I first talked about this decades ago, they would attack me all over the news, because they were really scared that I was pointing it out. But now Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has talked about it and so much more. So we're not saying people are bad, because of the proclivity of what has happened in a genetic mutation in the embryo, because all embryos, for those who don't know,
[01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:59.540]  starts out as female, and the first few weeks, it then shifts, and that expresses it's why men have nipples. It's it's literally we start out as a female, this is all mammals do. And then if it depends on the XY chromosome, we shift over to that they are literally knowingly putting chemicals out that do this. So we have to understand this has been done. We can't hate the people it's been done to, it's up to them to decide now what they want to do. But the
[01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:29.500]  system then coming after children, mentally ill children, autistic children, that aren't showing that the the genetic event to then target them is part of something larger that I see as the sterilization of children. And that's what they admit this is, is the popularization of sterilizing children. That's why they need to become adults. Like you did, they need to make a decision. As an adult. So I'm going to shut up because I'll talk forever. But I watched your show all the time. You're just as well spoken as I am when I'm not interrupting. So I'm going to shut up.
[01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:31.540]  For the next 10 minutes, Blair.
[01:41:32.059 --> 01:42:01.340]  Yeah, so, you know, obviously, it's one of the things that I get the most backlash for is my stance on trans kids and how there is a social contagion happening. There is a, you know, media fueled government fueled push to, you know, put kids through this pipeline of sterilization of surgery of hormones. And it's just so crazy to me because, you know, like I said earlier, I transitioned as an adult, this is a conclusion I came to, that that was right for me. I'm all about, you know, individualism and
[01:42:01.340 --> 01:42:28.460]  bodily autonomy and just doing what's right for you. And unfortunately, these kids aren't doing what's right for them. In almost every case, it's what's being told for them to do. You know, there's a very sick and twisted lie that is told to the parents of these kids and to the kids themselves, which is that, you know, I'm sure you've heard like, do you want a trans kid or a dead kid is what they say.
[01:42:28.700 --> 01:42:33.820]  And it's like, why would you put that dichotomy, that false dichotomy in front of these kids?
[01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:35.099]  Transition or you're dead?
[01:42:35.299 --> 01:42:49.860]  Right. You're putting that in their head. You're making them feel like those are their two options. And frankly, I mean, any person, any human being who is, you know, concerned at all, whether subconsciously or consciously with self-preservation and living, they're going to choose to be trans over dead.
[01:42:49.860 --> 01:43:12.299]  So, you know, it's brainwashing. And I wish I fully understood why the government has been pushing it as well, because I understand why the media would. You know, they're very obsessed with wokeism. They're very obsessed with latching onto groups. And nothing really gets, you know, fucking clicks like the trans shit either. You know, that shit's quick living, breathing clickbait.
[01:43:13.299 --> 01:43:38.299]  But, you know, it's really, really bad. And what I've been saying since the beginning of my career, and I probably was saying this all the way back eight years ago when we first started talking was, you know, I also don't want trans people who many of which I'm talking about genuine trans people who are not as, you know, fortunate as I am in many ways to be painted with this brush of like, this is what's really going on.
[01:43:38.299 --> 01:43:46.299]  Because I look at these like fucking TikTok people, and I'm like, these are just people who had their brains melted by the pandemic. And they're looking for anything to like, give them hope.
[01:43:46.299 --> 01:43:55.299]  So you're kind of saying they're stealing people's trans people's identity saying you represent the left, George Soros, the new world order. They're saying you belong to us.
[01:43:55.299 --> 01:44:16.299]  Yeah, and that's the other thing. They're making, you know, leftism and liberalism and wokeism synonymous with trans. And for me, it's kind of like, well, I'm also a human being before that. And so the idea that I must fall politically in line because of a factor like that doesn't like make any fucking sense to me.
[01:44:16.299 --> 01:44:26.299]  Like, it's actually stupid as fuck. It's as stupid as thinking a gay person has to be of political persuasion, or a black person or anything. It's like people are fucking people.
[01:44:26.299 --> 01:44:31.299]  Well, they're telling you who you're supposed to be. And that's really what it comes down to.
[01:44:31.299 --> 01:44:43.299]  And I don't fucking tolerate that. Because clearly, I've chosen who I want to be. I'm not letting anyone fucking tell me how to think after I choose to do all this to myself. Like, I'm not choosing the fucking brainwaves of another person. Fuck that.
[01:44:44.299 --> 01:45:05.299]  We do have delays in radio, but you do limited cussing and then do a little bit. No, no, it's okay. It's okay. You're on fire today. So let's talk about you, if you don't mind, as a child, as an adolescent, as a teenager. And then that's a fascinating thing, because we don't hate you. You're a wonderful person, smart person, nice person. What was that process? We'll talk about it like
[01:45:05.299 --> 01:45:07.299]  the process of what exactly?
[01:45:07.299 --> 01:45:10.299]  When you when you were like, Well, I don't feel like I'm a boy or
[01:45:11.299 --> 01:45:35.299]  Yeah. So I always say my earliest memories in life were feeling that sort of like weird disconnect and the gender dysphoria. So I was probably like four or five when I was feeling it. And people try to, you know, point out some sort of like hypocrisy on my part and say, Well, you felt like you were this way at four or five. So why are you against, you know, kids transitioning? And I'm like, that has nothing to do with my ability to consent to surgery and hormones.
[01:45:36.299 --> 01:45:38.299]  Well, yeah, it takes the parents out. It's the state.
[01:45:38.299 --> 01:45:46.299]  Yeah, it's completely separate. But but yeah, you know, the feelings just intensified as I got older. And then, you know, once I had
[01:45:46.299 --> 01:45:52.299]  Was it you felt like a woman and wanted to bake cookies or put on a dress? Or was it you wanted men? What was the feeling like?
[01:45:53.299 --> 01:46:06.299]  knew I liked men. I don't know, it was just a feeling of overall disconnect with the way the world was perceiving me and like the role I was, you know, expected to fit in society. And
[01:46:06.299 --> 01:46:11.299]  because back when you transition eight, nine years ago, it was not a big thing. So what was it like? You're just like,
[01:46:12.299 --> 01:46:24.299]  No, yeah, it wasn't. And in fact, you know, there's like this big D transitioner wave, which I think really, you know, solidifies my point that a lot of people who are not meant to do this are being pushed to do it.
[01:46:24.299 --> 01:46:26.299]  Yeah, a lot are bullied. So you're saying you weren't bullied into it?
[01:46:26.299 --> 01:46:45.299]  Oh, no, this was something that persisted in the face of all odds throughout my entire life in the sense of like, you know, I was growing up, like getting, you know, in fistfights for, you know, people calling me the try not to swear so much like the F word that means like, bad for gay people to slur or whatever.
[01:46:45.299 --> 01:46:46.299]  They're calling you a fag.
[01:46:46.299 --> 01:46:50.299]  Yeah, they're calling me a faggot. You know, it's like I was for getting called a faggot. I'm like, Wow, okay, that's crazy.
[01:46:51.299 --> 01:47:08.299]  Well, I think part of this is we see a 270 pound man who looks like a looks like Hulk Hogan. Hey, and he starts breaking stuff saying it's ma'am. We see that as a fraud. He's a former prisoner. He's a convict. He's doing this because it lets him be in general population with women.
[01:47:09.299 --> 01:47:28.299]  That's a fraud. But we see somebody that has transitioned and a woman by every aspect. And I think people kind of like, get like, okay, somebody made that decision because that is actually what they were what they were. And if you can realize if it's not attached to a political thing, we don't hate you. We think, oh, that makes sense.
[01:47:29.299 --> 01:47:36.299]  Yeah, looks like a woman is a woman compared to what these what these giant men are, who just want to be in general population with women in prison.
[01:47:37.299 --> 01:48:02.299]  Right. And that's the unfortunate part is that we have this society that is obsessed with tolerance at all costs, obviously, and inclusion of all at all costs. And so there are literal, you know, convicts and people who commit crimes, sometimes violent ones that understand that at the very least, them saying all of a sudden that they're trans is going to maybe not get a sentence reduction, but it's going to place them in a little bit of a nicer prison.
[01:48:03.299 --> 01:48:29.299]  It's going to place them in a little bit of a nicer situation. And, you know, a lot of them are also that's the other thing. Okay. If we want to go deep, there's there's really several types of trans people trans. There are people who felt that way from a very young age and then whatever, like me. And then there are people who do it for a fetish and it's like a sexual thing. And those are the ones that are attracted to women. And those ones are very different. Those are the ones that there's going to end up being the perverse in the bathroom.
[01:48:29.299 --> 01:48:37.299]  One hundred percent. One hundred percent. Whereas for me, you know, there was nothing ever sexual about it. It was just about who I was and what I wanted to do.
[01:48:38.299 --> 01:48:48.299]  I mean, you I would say like you put you in front of 10,000 people. They say that's a woman. Do you think it was the chemicals that we know the studies are there that embryonically put you that direction?
[01:48:48.299 --> 01:49:01.299]  I'm not writing it off. I mean, I've thought about it a lot. I think like, OK, so what caused this? Because it's clearly an anomaly. Right. Even at best, you know, the trans community shouldn't be mad at you for that. This is who you are.
[01:49:02.299 --> 01:49:11.299]  Right. I mean, as society has room for anomalies, I think the problem is when you try to make anomalies normal and by definition, it's not normal.
[01:49:12.299 --> 01:49:19.299]  Whoa, that is heavy. Exactly. I don't hate the anomaly. That's obviously legitimate. I hate a force thing on our children.
[01:49:20.299 --> 01:49:31.299]  Right. And, you know, it's it your audience is very smart. And even though they may be predisposed to be like, what is going on with this? At the same time, they're smart and they have nuanced opinions about things.
[01:49:32.299 --> 01:49:38.299]  And so a society they can understand that a society is always going to have anomalies. There's going to be people that don't fit into certain expectations.
[01:49:39.299 --> 01:49:46.299]  And the disarray comes when you try to normalize it to the extent of teaching it in schools, putting it in curriculum.
[01:49:47.299 --> 01:49:54.299]  You know, it's one thing to teach your kids that when they you know, as they go through life, they're going to see people that are different than them or gay or trans or whatever.
[01:49:55.299 --> 01:50:01.299]  It's another to be like, so what do you identify as to a four year old? Like, that's nuts. You know, it's it's it's planting a seed of doubt.
[01:50:02.299 --> 01:50:07.299]  So, you know, being anomaly isn't normal. And I don't think not being normal is a bad thing. Like you're not normal.
[01:50:08.299 --> 01:50:20.299]  I'm definitely not. So let me ask you this. Let me ask you this then. What is it like to watch giant biological men in boxing and MMA and swimming and in track and field in everything?
[01:50:21.299 --> 01:50:28.299]  Literally beating the snot out of biological women. I've heard you talk about it like they're hijacking and saying you represent them. You don't support that.
[01:50:28.299 --> 01:50:35.299]  No, no, no. It's it's sick, really. I mean, it's like an SNL sketch. It's just like a joke.
[01:50:36.299 --> 01:50:40.299]  It's it's you can believe your own two eyes when you look at it and you see that it's a problem.
[01:50:41.299 --> 01:50:47.299]  You don't have to go into the weeds of what do hormones do and what about, you know, the height or the bone mass or whatever.
[01:50:48.299 --> 01:50:53.299]  You can list out all those facts of why a biological male is always going to have an advantage, but you don't have to even do that because you can just see it.
[01:50:53.299 --> 01:50:59.299]  Like you look at Leah Thomas standing next to the women in the competition and it's like pull up Leah Thomas like he's like three feet taller.
[01:51:00.299 --> 01:51:06.299]  Right. Whereas your bones look like a woman. So I think like biological people say like it's like, well, you look like a woman.
[01:51:07.299 --> 01:51:14.299]  I mean, this dude is a dude. I mean, it's right. And it's, you know, he if he didn't do the trans thing, it's like he'd be like a hot dude.
[01:51:15.299 --> 01:51:21.299]  Like he's like, he's a buff dude. Yeah, he's a he's bigger than bigger than most men. I mean, yeah.
[01:51:25.299 --> 01:51:27.299]  It's like Andre the Giant versus girls.
[01:51:28.299 --> 01:51:33.299]  One hundred percent. And, you know, all of that does is portray to the community, the world community, right?
[01:51:34.299 --> 01:51:40.299]  Like just regular society that this, you know, small community of people, the trans community doesn't have their shifts together.
[01:51:40.299 --> 01:51:45.299]  When in reality, you look at how white liberals co-opt every single group and trans is one of them.
[01:51:46.299 --> 01:51:49.299]  So I would challenge people to there's a lot of crazy trans people on the Internet.
[01:51:50.299 --> 01:51:55.299]  But next time you see like a crazy thing being said, like in support of trans shit, look at who's saying it.
[01:51:56.299 --> 01:52:01.299]  Ninety percent of the time, it's some white liberal woman who just is, you know, co-opting the group and it feels comfortable speak.
[01:52:02.299 --> 01:52:08.299]  And then she'll attack me for having my own. Well, it's like if some KKK member says, I want to kill black people, that's not white people.
[01:52:09.299 --> 01:52:17.299]  Right, right. One hundred percent. And the other thing is I'm a double anomaly in the sense of usually trans people who actually transition like myself.
[01:52:18.299 --> 01:52:22.299]  They don't want to be on camera like this. They don't want to have a career in the public. They want to blend into society.
[01:52:23.299 --> 01:52:28.299]  So that's the other thing stacked against them is they don't speak out because what's in it for them.
[01:52:29.299 --> 01:52:32.299]  So it's perfect. It's still there. Oh, it's perfect. It's a small group.
[01:52:32.299 --> 01:52:38.299]  And then even within that, the ones that are really trans usually just want to live, you know, quiet lives.
[01:52:39.299 --> 01:52:42.299]  Whereas, you know, I'm out here running my mouth every day, but that's just because I'm called to do it.
[01:52:43.299 --> 01:52:50.299]  So how is the left responding to you? Oh, my God. How much time have you got?
[01:52:51.299 --> 01:52:59.299]  We have a lot of time on death threats, on death threats, FBI calls, on FBI calls, people showing up in my house.
[01:52:59.299 --> 01:53:02.299]  I've been doxed every single place I've lived since I've started this.
[01:53:03.299 --> 01:53:08.299]  You know, I do speaking events sometimes and they'll come and they'll come with like bike locks in their hands,
[01:53:09.299 --> 01:53:13.299]  like the kind that you would just like bash someone over the head with, like just crazy, you know.
[01:53:14.299 --> 01:53:18.299]  And so for me, I grew up in a very small conservative town.
[01:53:19.299 --> 01:53:25.299]  And so I feel like because of that, I had maybe a bit of a resentment towards that archetype of person,
[01:53:25.299 --> 01:53:29.299]  because in the beginning, that kind of person was the person who was kind of against me.
[01:53:30.299 --> 01:53:34.299]  I was getting bullied a lot as a kid. But as I got older, I realized those people really hold society together,
[01:53:35.299 --> 01:53:40.299]  not because, you know, their kids were being, you know, drugs, but because there are so few people with morals anymore.
[01:53:41.299 --> 01:53:45.299]  And if you get that from religion, if you get that from God, I'm so happy about that.
[01:53:46.299 --> 01:53:51.299]  Because, you know, the past few years, I think we've seen what happens when people just have no higher purpose
[01:53:51.299 --> 01:53:56.299]  and no, you know, desire for goodness. It's like they burn cities down.
[01:53:57.299 --> 01:54:02.299]  I totally agree with you. And so what I'm saying to viewers and listeners, my viewers get this, 90 percent of them,
[01:54:03.299 --> 01:54:09.299]  you're not the enemy. And this is it is true, folks, the chemicals.
[01:54:10.299 --> 01:54:12.299]  I don't know if it's your case, Blair, but it's happening.
[01:54:13.299 --> 01:54:15.299]  And we can't hate people that are confused because these chemicals were dumped on them.
[01:54:16.299 --> 01:54:19.299]  It's a fact that's happening. So instead of them, they're confused.
[01:54:19.299 --> 01:54:21.299]  This is happening. And the globalists come and say, we're going to cut you up.
[01:54:22.299 --> 01:54:25.299]  We're going to hate you. You know, we're going to say you're under attack. Be with us.
[01:54:26.299 --> 01:54:29.299]  We lovingly care about everybody and then scientifically look at what's going on here.
[01:54:30.299 --> 01:54:34.299]  And then people that have gone through this did not not not hate them, but actually embrace them.
[01:54:35.299 --> 01:54:40.299]  Yeah. You know, the more I think about it, because we've had these conversations before about like the chemicals in the water.
[01:54:41.299 --> 01:54:43.299]  And if that was a factor in like what ultimately made me this way.
[01:54:43.299 --> 01:54:49.299]  And I think it probably was because at the end of the day, I was four years old, still had the same mannerisms,
[01:54:50.299 --> 01:54:54.299]  still had the same like walk. My voice didn't even drop like when I hit puberty.
[01:54:55.299 --> 01:54:56.299]  It's straight up. This has been my voice my entire life.
[01:54:57.299 --> 01:55:02.299]  So it's like, yeah, I clearly incurred some sort of like feminization through chemicals.
[01:55:03.299 --> 01:55:04.299]  I mean, the chemicals do that in mammals and frogs.
[01:55:05.299 --> 01:55:09.299]  It's a male biologically, but it has a female build. I mean, it's female.
[01:55:09.299 --> 01:55:16.299]  Right. And if you're dealing with that in the best way, you know how, which involves, you know, I paid for my transition, my entire self.
[01:55:17.299 --> 01:55:23.299]  Like, you know, if someone chooses to deal with that and the way they deal with that, it's like it was anyone to like be mad.
[01:55:24.299 --> 01:55:26.299]  We've heard the horror stories. I don't get personal, but we can.
[01:55:27.299 --> 01:55:28.299]  Was yours horrible or was it OK?
[01:55:29.299 --> 01:55:30.299]  Like the surgeries and stuff? No, no.
[01:55:31.299 --> 01:55:35.299]  I've had like 100 percent success rates, recovery rates.
[01:55:36.299 --> 01:55:40.299]  Everything's been great. But you know, that's not the case for everyone, obviously.
[01:55:41.299 --> 01:55:44.299]  Well, all I know is we're all being biologically changed right now.
[01:55:45.299 --> 01:55:48.299]  We need to admit they're doing it to us and then not hate people that it's happened to.
[01:55:49.299 --> 01:55:50.299]  We need to admit it's happening.
[01:55:51.299 --> 01:55:53.299]  Yeah, 100 percent. There's no point in being denial about anything in life.
[01:55:54.299 --> 01:55:58.299]  And that can seem hypocritical for people who don't really have a lot of familiarity with the subjects.
[01:55:59.299 --> 01:56:02.299]  But, you know, I'm one of those people who 100 percent knows I'm biologically male.
[01:56:02.299 --> 01:56:07.299]  100 percent is OK with it. And I've actually never understood why I shouldn't be OK with that.
[01:56:08.299 --> 01:56:12.299]  Like in terms of like, yeah, I can, you know, alter my appearance and live the way I want.
[01:56:13.299 --> 01:56:16.299]  But like, what is the shame in being like, yeah, that's where I started?
[01:56:17.299 --> 01:56:20.299]  Well, I got to say out of all the transition people I've seen on TV and everywhere.
[01:56:21.299 --> 01:56:24.299]  I mean, I think like like my my genetics says this is a woman.
[01:56:25.299 --> 01:56:27.299]  And but whether you're well, whatever you you're a human that God made.
[01:56:27.299 --> 01:56:31.299]  And so what I'm concerned about is these new babies that are, oh, gay men don't want a woman.
[01:56:32.299 --> 01:56:33.299]  Two men spliced genetics. Well, not a woman.
[01:56:34.299 --> 01:56:35.299]  It's not mitochondrial DNA. It's not a person.
[01:56:36.299 --> 01:56:37.299]  It may look like a person may walk around.
[01:56:38.299 --> 01:56:43.299]  But this is the least of our issues is is is is is people like like you.
[01:56:44.299 --> 01:56:46.299]  I mean, we're all Blair White.
[01:56:47.299 --> 01:56:49.299]  I mean, we're all being like this meat allergy they're giving us.
[01:56:50.299 --> 01:56:51.299]  They're jacking with all of us.
[01:56:52.299 --> 01:56:53.299]  Yeah. And look at like how many kids have autism now.
[01:56:54.299 --> 01:56:55.299]  Look at how many kids are dealing with issues.
[01:56:56.299 --> 01:56:58.299]  And then you're lucky you just had this effect.
[01:56:59.299 --> 01:57:00.299]  You're like an X man or X woman.
[01:57:01.299 --> 01:57:03.299]  Imagine what the kids are can't even talk.
[01:57:04.299 --> 01:57:05.299]  That's that's what's so scary.
[01:57:06.299 --> 01:57:08.299]  Like I look at, you know, the way like the next generation is.
[01:57:09.299 --> 01:57:14.299]  And, you know, it's not only just the way they've been sort of altered chemically and societally.
[01:57:15.299 --> 01:57:19.299]  But also, you know, these these have them looking like they have no attention span.
[01:57:20.299 --> 01:57:21.299]  They can't hold a conversation.
[01:57:21.299 --> 01:57:22.299]  Exactly. They call them cyborgs.
[01:57:23.299 --> 01:57:24.299]  The globalist brag.
[01:57:25.299 --> 01:57:28.299]  So you're a biological man that feels like they're a woman who looks and acts like a woman.
[01:57:29.299 --> 01:57:30.299]  And it's a great person.
[01:57:31.299 --> 01:57:32.299]  We're already cyborgs with this.
[01:57:33.299 --> 01:57:34.299]  People are pissed off that men think they're women.
[01:57:35.299 --> 01:57:36.299]  We're already a cyborg.
[01:57:37.299 --> 01:57:38.299]  Right. Everyone's a whole robot.
[01:57:39.299 --> 01:57:40.299]  But also, what happened to I was just thinking about this the other day.
[01:57:41.299 --> 01:57:43.299]  There used to be so many, you know, news stories about.
[01:57:44.299 --> 01:57:45.299]  Hold on. Let's come right back.
[01:57:46.299 --> 01:57:47.299]  Yeah.
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:53.640]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through Mother Nature has given us the answer.
[01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:59.640]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum CBD oil, the incredible things it does for your nerves, your brain,
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:04.640]  your entire physiological system, for your nervous system particularly.
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:06.640]  Everybody knows it's incredible, it works.
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:11.640]  We have the strongest, best CBD oil you're going to find anywhere at the lowest price.
[01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:17.640]  Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for 30% more because that's who we're getting it from.
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:20.640]  Made right here in Central Texas.
[01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:23.640]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:29.640]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.
[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:32.640]  It's based right here in Texas and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:36.640]  And here's what's even crazier, 30% off of what they're selling it for.
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:39.640]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:44.640]  So this is the highest rated, already at the lowest price, now even a lower price.
[01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:47.640]  Rebel Zen, get yours at mfulworthstore.com now.
[01:58:47.640 --> 01:58:56.640]  When hope and love has been lost and you fall to the ground, you must find a way.
[01:58:56.640 --> 01:59:03.640]  When the darkness descends and you're told it's the end, you must find a way.
[01:59:03.640 --> 01:59:09.640]  When God decides to look the other way and a clown takes the throne, we must find a way.
[01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:11.640]  You will find a way.
[01:59:11.640 --> 01:59:14.640]  Dig down and find faith.
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:22.640]  When you're close to the edge with a gun to your head, you must find a way.
[01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:25.640]  We have entered the fray and we will not obey.
[01:59:25.640 --> 01:59:30.640]  We must find a way and find faith.
[01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:37.640]  We won't let them divide.
[01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:39.640]  We will never abide.
[01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:42.640]  We will find a way.
[01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:45.640]  introwars.com
[01:59:57.580 --> 02:00:13.660]  Dr. Charles Morgan, former CIA and consultant for the U.S. military on neurological sciences,
[02:00:13.660 --> 02:00:20.019]  spoke to cadets at West Point in 2018 about the current state of technology.
[02:00:20.019 --> 02:00:26.860]  He briefed the cadets on experiments from 2013 where humans were given neural implants
[02:00:26.860 --> 02:00:31.660]  that allowed them to control prosthetic arms with their thoughts.
[02:00:31.660 --> 02:00:36.580]  Experiments where one person can control another person's hands by just wearing an
[02:00:36.580 --> 02:00:37.580]  EEG cap.
[02:00:37.580 --> 02:00:42.700]  The person on the receiving end described the sensation as rather odd, said, I didn't
[02:00:42.700 --> 02:00:45.180]  know anything until I saw my hand beginning to move.
[02:00:45.180 --> 02:00:50.380]  But the really fun part was that you're taking over somebody else's physical body with the
[02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:53.100]  mind of another human.
[02:00:53.100 --> 02:00:55.620]  So what do you think would be the next step?
[02:00:55.620 --> 02:01:00.940]  Experiments where information is transmitted from one mind to another and experiments where
[02:01:00.940 --> 02:01:02.940]  memories are erased.
[02:01:02.940 --> 02:01:07.700]  Dr. Morgan admits they have the technology to target an individual person.
[02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:09.540]  But you can engineer anything.
[02:01:09.540 --> 02:01:13.460]  You can engineer a unique thing that would only kill one person in the world.
[02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:18.300]  And are working on the ability to erase the memories of any human they choose.
[02:01:18.300 --> 02:01:24.019]  Their biggest challenge five years ago was being able to interface with the hippocampus
[02:01:24.180 --> 02:01:27.059]  without the use of physical wires.
[02:01:27.059 --> 02:01:32.340]  And this is most likely one of the motivating factors for the deployment of the experimental
[02:01:32.340 --> 02:01:34.460]  COVID shots.
[02:01:34.460 --> 02:01:40.340]  Using dark field microscopy, Dr. Ana Maria Mijalcea has captured in great detail what
[02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:46.980]  the scientific literature describes as effective technologies that exist today.
[02:01:46.980 --> 02:01:49.860]  Technology such as quantum dots.
[02:01:49.900 --> 02:01:56.340]  Quantum dots are nanotechnology with the ability to organize, operate, communicate, and build
[02:01:56.340 --> 02:01:58.700]  structures within the blood.
[02:01:58.700 --> 02:02:04.580]  They do so with a tunable photoluminescence that can be programmed to dictate various
[02:02:04.580 --> 02:02:07.820]  tasks via optical communication.
[02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:14.140]  The description and images displayed in the scientific literature compared to what Mijalcea's
[02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:18.180]  dark field microscopy has captured are the same.
[02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:22.620]  You can see the quantum dots blinking in different colors, acting as the artificial
[02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:27.260]  intelligence directing the self-assembly around them.
[02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:31.700]  Bubbles are created within the blood that act as construction sites.
[02:02:31.700 --> 02:02:38.780]  Within these construction bubbles, the quantum dots organize the various materials into self-assembly.
[02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:44.300]  These technologies are being found in both the blood of the vaccinated and in the blood
[02:02:44.300 --> 02:02:46.100]  of the unvaccinated.
[02:02:46.100 --> 02:02:51.900]  Depending on what materials are needed, the quantum dots will trigger them into self-assembly.
[02:02:51.900 --> 02:02:59.019]  The COVID vaccines are full of rare and heavy metals to make all manner of nanotechnology.
[02:02:59.019 --> 02:03:04.059]  But it seems as if almost everyone is infected with some sort of nanotech.
[02:03:04.059 --> 02:03:09.900]  According to several research teams, everyone's blood seems to contain the materials required
[02:03:09.900 --> 02:03:14.300]  to produce the filaments and the latticework for this technology.
[02:03:14.300 --> 02:03:19.380]  Blood samples that appear to be healthy have been completely transformed by applying a
[02:03:19.380 --> 02:03:23.700]  mere 10 milliamps of electric current for two hours.
[02:03:23.700 --> 02:03:28.019]  And it looks as if we may have been infected by the chemtrails.
[02:03:28.019 --> 02:03:31.540]  Morgellons disease was first reported in 2002.
[02:03:31.540 --> 02:03:36.460]  It's when synthetic fibers or filaments are growing in a person's body.
[02:03:36.460 --> 02:03:41.740]  It has been theorized for decades that this was being spread via chemtrails.
[02:03:41.740 --> 02:03:46.420]  And under a microscope, it appears to be the same filaments that people today are calling
[02:03:46.420 --> 02:03:53.260]  blood clots and what the scientific journals call self-assembled hydrogels.
[02:03:53.260 --> 02:04:01.580]  According to Dane Wigington from geoengineeringwatch.org, nanoparticles are being sprayed worldwide.
[02:04:01.580 --> 02:04:06.280]  The good news is that Dr. Mielcia's research has found a remedy.
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:11.340]  The iron in the infected blood has been oxidized to a three plus state.
[02:04:11.340 --> 02:04:16.820]  And by taking antioxidants, one is able to dissolve these filament clots.
[02:04:16.820 --> 02:04:24.019]  She has found that EDTA chelation therapy will remedy infected blood within three days.
[02:04:24.019 --> 02:04:27.900]  And megadosing vitamin C also seems to work.
[02:04:27.900 --> 02:04:30.380]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[02:04:41.340 --> 02:04:52.860]  Blair White, our guest in studio, coming up in T-minus 60 seconds.
[02:04:52.860 --> 02:04:53.860]  Everybody, you know, tune in.

[02:05:57.340 --> 02:06:10.740]  You thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer
[02:06:10.740 --> 02:06:14.380]  to the violence of the sun.
[02:06:14.380 --> 02:06:20.420]  Broadcasting live from the U.N. stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to The Alex
[02:06:20.420 --> 02:06:21.420]  Jones Show.
[02:06:21.420 --> 02:06:30.019]  So let's not fall into the trap of attacking people that have been chemically altered in
[02:06:30.019 --> 02:06:33.980]  the first trimester of their development that all the studies show.
[02:06:33.980 --> 02:06:37.580]  Let's not buy into the globalist trap that all the things they're doing to our children
[02:06:37.580 --> 02:06:39.340]  are Blair White's fault.
[02:06:39.340 --> 02:06:41.500]  This is so important.
[02:06:41.500 --> 02:06:45.180]  I'm not an apologist for Blair White, because Blair White's done nothing wrong.
[02:06:45.180 --> 02:06:49.019]  And Blair White, since going public eight years ago, has done nothing but stand up for our
[02:06:49.019 --> 02:06:51.660]  children and independence and freedom.
[02:06:51.660 --> 02:06:56.300]  But Blair asked a question earlier we'll get to now, why is the government pushing the
[02:06:56.300 --> 02:06:57.300]  trans movement?
[02:06:57.300 --> 02:07:03.460]  Well, I said this decades ago, but Yuval Noah Harari in his latest book says the trans movement
[02:07:03.460 --> 02:07:08.740]  is the tip of the spear of the transhumanist movement, that after World War II was embarrassed,
[02:07:08.740 --> 02:07:15.140]  they were the eugenics movement, Hitler, and so they became the transhumanist movement.
[02:07:15.140 --> 02:07:18.140]  So all of us are trans.
[02:07:18.140 --> 02:07:23.460]  All of us are being hit with synthetic chemicals, biologicals, radiologicals, electromagnetic.
[02:07:23.460 --> 02:07:31.380]  They're giving us shots, not just the COVID shots, that give us this protein, the alpha
[02:07:31.380 --> 02:07:34.640]  gal syndrome, where we can't eat meat anymore.
[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:35.940]  They have mutated us.
[02:07:35.940 --> 02:07:37.700]  We are all mutants.
[02:07:37.700 --> 02:07:39.460]  We are all being attacked.
[02:07:39.460 --> 02:07:41.420]  We are all being targeted.
[02:07:41.420 --> 02:07:42.420]  This is the reality.
[02:07:42.420 --> 02:07:50.059]  And instead of hating people that have been hit by this, we should talk to them, understand,
[02:07:50.059 --> 02:07:54.900]  because we're all in the same boat in different perspectives.
[02:07:54.900 --> 02:08:03.380]  And it's crazy that Blair White, since Blair transitioned nine years ago, has been public
[02:08:03.380 --> 02:08:07.740]  fighting this before it was the top big issue in the last three, four years.
[02:08:07.740 --> 02:08:15.940]  And it just shows you how God works in mysterious ways and how you have somebody that they would
[02:08:15.940 --> 02:08:17.260]  love to be their spokesperson.
[02:08:17.260 --> 02:08:21.900]  I haven't asked you this, but I know, I bet you've been reached out to by Hollywood.
[02:08:21.900 --> 02:08:24.100]  I bet you've been reached out to by the power structure.
[02:08:24.100 --> 02:08:27.620]  You're an articulate, amazing person, a beautiful person.
[02:08:27.620 --> 02:08:30.460]  They would love for you to be their spokesperson.
[02:08:30.460 --> 02:08:33.860]  But instead, you from day one have not been.
[02:08:33.860 --> 02:08:39.660]  And I think inherently at a spiritual level, I realize that God's working through you.
[02:08:39.660 --> 02:08:42.059]  And it's an amazing thing.
[02:08:42.059 --> 02:08:44.340]  How do you feel about that statement?
[02:08:44.340 --> 02:08:45.340]  Well, thank you.
[02:08:45.340 --> 02:08:48.620]  I mean, I struggle with my belief in God.
[02:08:48.620 --> 02:08:52.220]  I don't know how much I believe in God.
[02:08:52.220 --> 02:08:56.900]  That's a journey I'm kind of on, and I'm actively trying to get there.
[02:08:56.900 --> 02:08:58.500]  But the older I get, the more I do.
[02:08:58.820 --> 02:09:04.740]  The older I get, the more I feel like, even though I'm actively choosing all the things
[02:09:04.740 --> 02:09:11.740]  that I do, I've made a choice not to assimilate to the talking points of the left because
[02:09:11.740 --> 02:09:13.139]  it would get me more popularity.
[02:09:13.139 --> 02:09:15.180]  And make no mistake, I know for a fact it would.
[02:09:15.180 --> 02:09:16.180]  Well, talk about that.
[02:09:16.180 --> 02:09:19.300]  I've never asked you, but I'm sure they've reached out to you.
[02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:20.300]  For sure.
[02:09:20.300 --> 02:09:26.380]  There's been just things over the years that I've been asked to compromise my values for
[02:09:26.380 --> 02:09:27.380]  a lot of things.
[02:09:27.380 --> 02:09:30.020]  And I think now it's kind of understood that I'll never do that.
[02:09:30.020 --> 02:09:32.940]  I've been very consistent for almost a decade now.
[02:09:32.940 --> 02:09:37.820]  But yeah, you know, that's why people think, you know, they call me sometimes a grifter
[02:09:37.820 --> 02:09:42.380]  or that I'm just like, you know, faking my opinions for popularity on the right as if
[02:09:42.380 --> 02:09:46.300]  I wouldn't have ten times the popularity on the left if I had those talking points.
[02:09:46.300 --> 02:09:47.780]  You'd be hosting a national TV show.
[02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:51.500]  I would have maybe two or three shows on CNN.
[02:09:51.500 --> 02:09:55.340]  But I would rather die than do that because I don't want to ever have to mute any part
[02:09:55.340 --> 02:09:57.700]  of myself to do that.
[02:09:57.700 --> 02:09:59.980]  But you know, sometimes that's it.
[02:09:59.980 --> 02:10:03.260]  You could be their ultimate sales sales lady, but you're not.
[02:10:03.260 --> 02:10:05.660]  Yeah, because that's demented.
[02:10:05.660 --> 02:10:09.460]  And again, I struggle with spirituality sometimes, but I that is the devil.
[02:10:09.460 --> 02:10:16.260]  I mean, anytime you're pushing kids to hurt themselves, it's like, wow, you're just evil.
[02:10:16.260 --> 02:10:18.100]  And what do you think of the women cutting their breasts off?
[02:10:18.100 --> 02:10:20.620]  I mean, that is just that's what I think about all the time.
[02:10:20.620 --> 02:10:26.860]  So the way it affects biological females seems to be in some ways even more brutal
[02:10:26.860 --> 02:10:27.860]  than like the males.
[02:10:27.860 --> 02:10:30.940]  Oh, well, they cut their arms and legs and make a fake.
[02:10:30.940 --> 02:10:31.940]  Yeah.
[02:10:31.940 --> 02:10:37.460]  I mean, it's it's demented and it's harder to come back for the females, too.
[02:10:37.460 --> 02:10:40.740]  I've noticed that like the transitioners, you know, their voice is permanently altered
[02:10:40.740 --> 02:10:42.300]  and, you know, those scars.
[02:10:42.300 --> 02:10:46.500]  It's like what even gives you scars that I mean, I don't know.
[02:10:46.500 --> 02:10:53.139]  And then, you know, the the penis that they give them is obviously I don't even know what
[02:10:53.139 --> 02:10:56.820]  to call it, but the last of which would be called a penis, you know.
[02:10:56.820 --> 02:11:01.620]  So it's just sad, you know, and there's a lot of purposeful misleading about what the
[02:11:01.620 --> 02:11:03.300]  surgeries can and can't do.
[02:11:03.300 --> 02:11:11.540]  And, you know, right now, my entire purpose is saving the kids from that, because I realize,
[02:11:11.540 --> 02:11:15.300]  you know, people say, like, well, what about you know, why are you siding with evil conservatives?
[02:11:15.300 --> 02:11:18.260]  Is there just going to be backlash and take away your, you know, right to transition?
[02:11:18.260 --> 02:11:21.300]  I'm like, first of all, I already did that, like transition.
[02:11:21.300 --> 02:11:25.120]  And second of all, you could take anything away from me if it means helping a child.
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:31.620]  And the fact that more people don't have that mentality or that instinctual, like inclination
[02:11:31.620 --> 02:11:32.620]  boggles my mind.
[02:11:32.620 --> 02:11:34.620]  And frankly, I don't even really like kids that much.
[02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:36.059]  I don't want kids in the future.
[02:11:36.059 --> 02:11:38.700]  I don't like love when kids are around, you know what I mean?
[02:11:38.700 --> 02:11:44.580]  But I still recognize the insane injustice that's being done to them under the guise.
[02:11:44.860 --> 02:11:48.460]  Well, they're stealing their free will because they can't make a decision until they're older.
[02:11:48.460 --> 02:11:49.740]  Right, right.
[02:11:49.740 --> 02:11:52.620]  And we seem to understand that in every other area of life, right?
[02:11:52.620 --> 02:11:56.340]  Except for this one, except I can't get cigarettes, can't get alcohol, can't join the military,
[02:11:56.340 --> 02:11:57.940]  but you can chop yourself up.
[02:11:57.940 --> 02:11:58.940]  Right.
[02:11:58.940 --> 02:12:00.820]  And if a child can consent to that, what can't they?
[02:12:00.820 --> 02:12:04.900]  I mean, there's a hell of a lot better argument for, you know, a 14 year old to drive a car
[02:12:04.900 --> 02:12:06.940]  than to do any of this stuff that they're pushing.
[02:12:06.940 --> 02:12:08.020]  No, I agree.
[02:12:08.020 --> 02:12:11.580]  And there's this whole pedophilic piggybacking on the trans movement.
[02:12:11.580 --> 02:12:12.660]  What do you make of that?
[02:12:12.660 --> 02:12:14.300]  So that is multilayered.
[02:12:14.300 --> 02:12:20.300]  So anyone who knows sort of the history of like the LGBT movement or community knows
[02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:24.700]  that there once was a time where the community recognized that pedophiles needed to be stamped
[02:12:24.700 --> 02:12:25.700]  out.
[02:12:25.700 --> 02:12:26.700]  You know, people might remember NAMBLA.
[02:12:26.700 --> 02:12:32.540]  It was that group back in the, you know, last century, actually now, like 60s, 70s.
[02:12:32.540 --> 02:12:35.860]  And that stood for, do you remember what that stood for?
[02:12:35.860 --> 02:12:37.900]  North American Man Boy Love Association.
[02:12:37.900 --> 02:12:38.900]  Right.
[02:12:38.900 --> 02:12:42.900]  Glad it came out of your mouth and not mine because eww.
[02:12:42.900 --> 02:12:45.820]  But you know, they were stamped out of the community with a swiftness because, you know,
[02:12:45.820 --> 02:12:49.540]  gay people and trans people said, that's not us.
[02:12:49.540 --> 02:12:54.300]  And how dare you try to take cover under our umbrella, basically.
[02:12:54.300 --> 02:13:01.660]  And now people seem to not be able to do that, you know, kicking out of them, which is crazy
[02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:04.540]  because it would be the best thing for them.
[02:13:04.540 --> 02:13:06.620]  There's a doubling down from everyone.
[02:13:06.620 --> 02:13:10.780]  If you say anything perceived as anti LGBT, people feel like they have to defend it and
[02:13:10.780 --> 02:13:12.340]  they find themselves defending pedophiles.
[02:13:12.780 --> 02:13:17.020]  I see every day people, whether they know it or not, some of them do, some of them don't
[02:13:17.020 --> 02:13:18.580]  defending pedophiles.
[02:13:18.580 --> 02:13:22.940]  I see it every day, whether it's the books in Florida and not just Florida, all across
[02:13:22.940 --> 02:13:23.940]  the country.
[02:13:23.940 --> 02:13:25.380]  Again, conservatives aren't banning books.
[02:13:25.380 --> 02:13:28.860]  We're saying don't give them to kids, right?
[02:13:28.860 --> 02:13:30.340]  Nobody's banning a hustler.
[02:13:30.340 --> 02:13:31.340]  Just don't give it to a six year old.
[02:13:31.340 --> 02:13:32.340]  Right.
[02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:34.940]  If you want to read a book about how to give a blowjob, have at it, but your kids shouldn't
[02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:36.460]  be reading it.
[02:13:36.460 --> 02:13:37.460]  Exactly.
[02:13:38.420 --> 02:13:44.059]  Nobody should be banning adults buying Jack Daniels, but don't give it to seven year olds.
[02:13:44.059 --> 02:13:45.059]  One hundred percent.
[02:13:45.059 --> 02:13:48.980]  And, you know, I was watching a clip from Timcast, Timcast IRL, where there was this
[02:13:48.980 --> 02:13:51.580]  liberal host that was a guest.
[02:13:51.580 --> 02:13:53.740]  And Tim asked her, like, what about this book?
[02:13:53.740 --> 02:13:56.620]  It was called like this book is gay or something like that.
[02:13:56.620 --> 02:13:58.820]  And she blindly just said, oh, that's a great book.
[02:13:58.820 --> 02:13:59.820]  I love it.
[02:13:59.820 --> 02:14:00.820]  Kids should read it.
[02:14:00.820 --> 02:14:03.460]  Instinctually, she had that response just because the word gay is in it.
[02:14:03.460 --> 02:14:04.460]  She didn't even know.
[02:14:05.460 --> 02:14:10.980]  This instructs how to give blowjobs and how to get on Grindr and over 18 app.
[02:14:10.980 --> 02:14:13.059]  Is that really like a book for third graders?
[02:14:13.059 --> 02:14:16.260]  And then, you know, she stuttered and she got scared because she realized she was acting
[02:14:16.260 --> 02:14:17.260]  like a genderqueer.
[02:14:17.260 --> 02:14:21.700]  It's telling kids to have sexual adults, literally priming them to be kidnapped.
[02:14:21.700 --> 02:14:22.700]  Right.
[02:14:22.700 --> 02:14:26.740]  And that's the thing about, you know, the elites and about sort of the people who actually
[02:14:26.740 --> 02:14:31.480]  run the world is there's actually an incentive to normalize it because we see what they do.
[02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:33.180]  We see what they want us to dehumanize ourselves.
[02:14:33.460 --> 02:14:38.100]  But I want to go back to this for new listeners or regular listeners or whoever's tuning in.
[02:14:38.100 --> 02:14:41.700]  You're like, Alex, you know, what are you endorsing?
[02:14:41.700 --> 02:14:42.700]  I'm not endorsing anything.
[02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:45.740]  I'm covering what's happening.
[02:14:45.740 --> 02:14:55.580]  And if you put atrazine in a fish or a amphibian or a mammal or a marsupial or anything, it
[02:14:55.580 --> 02:14:59.300]  makes the males females.
[02:14:59.300 --> 02:15:01.880]  It shrivels their genitals down to nothing.
[02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:04.160]  It changes the brain physiology.
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:09.080]  So it really is true that it's bending someone towards the feminine.
[02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:11.720]  And then the frog is attracted to another male.
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:15.200]  The whether it's a bird, what does it matter?
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:16.320]  That's real.
[02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:20.280]  And then because this happened, we can't now when they did this, oh, you've all been hit
[02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:21.280]  by this.
[02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:22.280]  We represent you.
[02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:23.280]  We love you.
[02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:24.280]  The people that did it.
[02:15:24.280 --> 02:15:25.280]  We need to tell people, hey, this was done to you.
[02:15:25.280 --> 02:15:27.280]  We don't hate you for how you are now.
[02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:33.020]  But everybody has to admit that a giant biological experiment has been done and that we should
[02:15:33.020 --> 02:15:35.480]  like not hate the victims of it.
[02:15:35.480 --> 02:15:36.760]  So what about the girls?
[02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:41.000]  Because is the atrazine that explains like the feminization of the males.
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:45.320]  But what's for me, it seems like for the girls that want to be boys now, the high schoolers
[02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:49.639]  and whatever, is they're actually uncomfortable with the fact that they're developing as a
[02:15:49.639 --> 02:15:52.000]  woman and it's hard to develop as a woman in this society.
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.440]  You start getting looked at differently and they have body issues.
[02:15:54.440 --> 02:15:56.559]  Blair White, that's an incredible point you just raised.
[02:15:56.559 --> 02:15:57.559]  And we've got the studies.
[02:15:57.559 --> 02:15:59.840]  Anybody can pull these up.
[02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:06.200]  What happens to a woman after she has menopause is she starts producing more testosterone
[02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:07.800]  out of her ovaries.
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:15.240]  And so the chemicals that bend a fetus towards female attributes or female characteristics
[02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:18.559]  in a girl makes them go into puberty earlier.
[02:16:18.559 --> 02:16:19.559]  Three-year-olds are going to puberty.
[02:16:19.559 --> 02:16:20.559]  Used to be 12.
[02:16:20.559 --> 02:16:23.520]  Now it's like nine is the average age.
[02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:24.520]  Those explode.
[02:16:24.520 --> 02:16:25.880]  The women hyper-age.
[02:16:25.880 --> 02:16:29.440]  So a man, it ages them some, but makes them feminine.
[02:16:29.440 --> 02:16:35.680]  They're not a woman, but they're now becoming feminine because they were originally a male,
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:36.680]  but they're moving towards feminine.
[02:16:36.680 --> 02:16:38.320]  And they're like, well, this is who I am.
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:39.320]  It feels normal.
[02:16:39.320 --> 02:16:40.320]  They're told to do it.
[02:16:40.320 --> 02:16:41.540]  We don't hate them for that.
[02:16:41.540 --> 02:16:47.520]  But what the chemicals do on average, there's a bunch of them, is they put girls into puberty
[02:16:47.520 --> 02:16:48.520]  earlier.
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:55.840]  They make them hyper-feminine, and then that accelerates them into, I want to call it masculine,
[02:16:55.840 --> 02:17:02.160]  but I'm not trying to be mean to these women, but you see these women look like male creatures
[02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:03.160]  or something.
[02:17:03.160 --> 02:17:07.400]  They look like a, and they're like, this is the body they're in because those chemicals
[02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:08.400]  did that to them.
[02:17:08.400 --> 02:17:10.640]  So the answer is it doesn't make them male or female.
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:12.320]  It makes them a mutant.
[02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:13.320]  Right.
[02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:18.320]  And you know, it's also teenage girls have so much body issues, just psychologically,
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:22.040]  you know, and there's a lot of these detransitioners that are now suing, which I think is going
[02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:24.160]  to make the difference for, you know, going forward.
[02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:25.160]  Talk about that.
[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:26.160]  That's what's going to stop it finally.
[02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:27.160]  Oh yeah.
[02:17:27.160 --> 02:17:31.360]  And we see that it, you know, the U.S. is always like a little bit behind Europe in
[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:33.560]  terms of the trajectory of certain issues.
[02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:40.360]  So for this one, you know, European countries like the UK, Sweden, I'll show you, name one,
[02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:41.360]  right?
[02:17:41.360 --> 02:17:45.720]  They were doing trans surgeries on minors before the U.S. and then they started seeing
[02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:47.200]  the negative ramifications.
[02:17:47.200 --> 02:17:50.600]  All the kids coming out, you know, saying this ruined my life and they started suing
[02:17:50.600 --> 02:17:53.960]  and now they're starting to revoke a lot of the guidelines saying that it is appropriate
[02:17:53.960 --> 02:17:54.960]  for children.
[02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:55.960]  Yeah.
[02:17:55.960 --> 02:18:00.119]  They're saying teachers and activists can't recruit children, right?
[02:18:00.119 --> 02:18:03.720]  And also you can't even in a lot of these countries now be placed on hormones as a minor
[02:18:03.720 --> 02:18:04.720]  anymore.
[02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:05.720]  They've rescinded all the, which is good.
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:11.000]  It's 100% good and you know, that'll happen in the U.S. as well, but it does take longer
[02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:15.760]  because we're slower, but they are starting to sue now in the U.S. which is going to make
[02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:16.760]  all the difference.
[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:19.840]  So I want Christians and conservatives to listen to me because I only tell you what
[02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:20.840]  I believe is true.
[02:18:20.840 --> 02:18:21.920]  I know this in my heart.
[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:22.920]  You're a good person.
[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:23.920]  You love the children.
[02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:29.280]  You're a, we should, we're very blessed to have you as an amazing, beautiful, smart person
[02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:32.560]  who has been through this and who is being honest with people.
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:36.020]  You're the perfect spokesperson to expose us.
[02:18:36.020 --> 02:18:39.800]  Because I've literally been through it and I was able to make that decision as an adult
[02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:41.240]  and weigh the pros and cons.
[02:18:41.240 --> 02:18:42.440]  But guess what kids can't do?
[02:18:42.440 --> 02:18:45.200]  They can't weigh pros and cons and they can't, you know, foresee the future.
[02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:48.480]  And you know, I can't have biological children anymore.
[02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:50.880]  And when kids go through transition, they can't either.
[02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:52.400]  They become sterile for life.
[02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:54.880]  And the idea that a child can consent to that is just nuts.
[02:18:54.880 --> 02:19:02.760]  Well, and that's the thing is that they count on us hating people that have been changed
[02:19:02.760 --> 02:19:03.920]  by the chemicals.
[02:19:03.920 --> 02:19:07.840]  No, we don't hate those that have been triage of this.
[02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:12.280]  And the way God works mysterious ways, it creates beautiful things, but the agenda isn't
[02:19:12.280 --> 02:19:13.280]  beautiful.
[02:19:13.280 --> 02:19:14.280]  It's evil.
[02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:17.160]  So we don't hate people that have been targeted, but we have an open debate about it.
[02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:18.160]  Oh, 100%.
[02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:24.119]  And you know, I do feel as though everything is so nuanced and it's just, there's no black
[02:19:24.119 --> 02:19:28.280]  and white in this almost is that, you know, I'm living my optimal life right now.
[02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:32.760]  Like I, I can't imagine if I hadn't transitioned, I would be living a quality life even close
[02:19:32.760 --> 02:19:33.760]  to this.
[02:19:33.760 --> 02:19:36.720]  Does that mean that's the case for, you know, everyone and everyone who feels like they should
[02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:37.720]  transition should.
[02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:38.800]  Absolutely not.
[02:19:38.800 --> 02:19:39.800]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:19:39.800 --> 02:19:41.680]  You are a success story.
[02:19:41.680 --> 02:19:45.240]  Most of these aren't statistically massive depression, massive suicide.
[02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:47.560]  Can you speak to why these other people?
[02:19:47.560 --> 02:19:48.560]  Yeah.
[02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:53.280]  So that's the thing is that, you know, the corporate press, they only show one side of
[02:19:53.280 --> 02:19:55.720]  the issue, which is the success stories.
[02:19:55.720 --> 02:19:59.660]  So again, if I were parroting leftist talking points, I'd be on CNN every day as a success
[02:19:59.660 --> 02:20:01.800]  story about transition.
[02:20:01.800 --> 02:20:02.800]  So they don't show the other.
[02:20:02.800 --> 02:20:03.800]  Oh, you'd be a rockstar.
[02:20:03.800 --> 02:20:04.800]  Right.
[02:20:04.800 --> 02:20:08.760]  But they don't show the other side, which is these kids having their lives ruined.
[02:20:08.760 --> 02:20:12.800]  And because of that, more kids get sent down the pipeline because all they're seeing is
[02:20:12.800 --> 02:20:13.800]  success stories.
[02:20:13.800 --> 02:20:15.160]  They're not seeing the other side.
[02:20:15.160 --> 02:20:16.400]  So that's why I like to highlight it.
[02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:22.680]  I've interviewed so many of these young people on my channel and, uh, it's, it's very interesting.
[02:20:22.680 --> 02:20:28.000]  What they all seem to have in common is they're all running away from homosexuality.
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:32.280]  I've noticed that it's like, talk about that, that the boys that transitioned to girls, it's
[02:20:32.280 --> 02:20:37.800]  like they don't like being, you know, a faggot or whatever, gay.
[02:20:37.800 --> 02:20:40.280]  And then the girls, you know, they don't want to be lesbians.
[02:20:40.280 --> 02:20:43.400]  So they find that transitioning as a way to escape that.
[02:20:43.400 --> 02:20:47.560]  And what you see mirrored in the Middle East, which is so fascinating, is that transition
[02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:49.800]  is seen as a cure for being gay.
[02:20:49.800 --> 02:20:55.040]  They transition males to live as women because they would rather than be a transsexual woman.
[02:20:55.040 --> 02:20:57.080]  And I totally agree with what you're saying.
[02:20:57.080 --> 02:20:58.080]  Exactly.
[02:20:58.080 --> 02:20:59.080]  Yeah.
[02:20:59.119 --> 02:21:01.360]  They feel bad and guilty for how they feel.
[02:21:01.360 --> 02:21:05.680]  So they do these surgeries and what does it like for you to watch the big clinics and
[02:21:05.680 --> 02:21:08.760]  big colleges say we're going to make a hundred grand off each kid.
[02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:11.760]  That to me is the exploitation, right?
[02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:13.160]  And then that goes even deeper.
[02:21:13.160 --> 02:21:18.240]  There was once a time, five seconds ago where the left was against big pharma and now they're,
[02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:24.840]  you know, each, all the leftists I see ever are like bigger drug dealers than your average
[02:21:24.840 --> 02:21:25.840]  drug dealer.
[02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:28.680]  You got vaccines pushed on you, hormone blockers, puberty blockers.
[02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:32.800]  You can't talk to one of them without them talking about antidepressants, pills, hormones,
[02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:33.800]  whatever.
[02:21:33.800 --> 02:21:39.760]  It's, I can understand how it would seem hypocritical for me to say this, but people are too medicalized.
[02:21:39.760 --> 02:21:40.760]  They're too medicalized.
[02:21:40.760 --> 02:21:42.320]  So what, how do we, how do we do this?
[02:21:42.320 --> 02:21:45.560]  I think we don't hate anybody because of what color they are, what their sexual preference
[02:21:45.560 --> 02:21:46.560]  is.
[02:21:46.560 --> 02:21:49.480]  We agree we leave children alone and we decouple it from politics.
[02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:50.880]  100%.
[02:21:50.880 --> 02:21:57.920]  If we want to get down to the nitty gritty of what we should do, it's return, you know,
[02:21:57.920 --> 02:22:02.040]  sexualism to the medical definition, which is that is a mental disorder.
[02:22:02.040 --> 02:22:04.640]  I do believe that gender dysphoria is a mental disorder.
[02:22:04.640 --> 02:22:06.720]  They took it out of the DSM to be politically correct.
[02:22:06.720 --> 02:22:11.440]  But if we're going to say that social anxiety, which is in the DSM as a mental illness, how
[02:22:11.440 --> 02:22:14.680]  the hell is gender dysphoria not, you know what I mean?
[02:22:14.680 --> 02:22:18.000]  You, I would call a success story in this.
[02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:21.000]  Are you saying you were in dysphoria or what happened?
[02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:22.000]  I was.
[02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.840]  And for me, I pretty much cured it by transitioning.
[02:22:24.840 --> 02:22:28.520]  I mean, you can't, I don't think you can ever completely get rid of it, but I cared
[02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:29.760]  like 95% of it.
[02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:31.720]  You know, it's like, it's pretty much gone.
[02:22:31.720 --> 02:22:34.440]  Do you wish, I mean, are you happy you transitioned?
[02:22:34.440 --> 02:22:35.440]  100%.
[02:22:35.440 --> 02:22:36.440]  Yeah.
[02:22:36.440 --> 02:22:37.440]  I would never take it back.
[02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:38.440]  But that's the difference.
[02:22:38.440 --> 02:22:39.440]  It either helps your life or it doesn't.
[02:22:39.440 --> 02:22:42.480]  And what I'm seeing is that it's hurting so many lives.
[02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:43.480]  What's the average?
[02:22:43.480 --> 02:22:46.160]  It looks like it's mainly negative.
[02:22:46.160 --> 02:22:48.800]  It's hard to say because we're on a carpet bombing operation here.
[02:22:48.800 --> 02:22:49.800]  Yeah.
[02:22:49.800 --> 02:22:51.160]  And we're all caught up in our own algorithms too.
[02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:54.280]  So if you're in a right wing algorithm, you might be more inclined to only see the negative
[02:22:54.720 --> 02:22:55.720]  stories.
[02:22:55.720 --> 02:22:58.440]  And if you're in a left wing algorithm, it's all rainbows and sunshines, you know?
[02:22:58.440 --> 02:23:00.480]  But that's why I try to show both sides.
[02:23:00.480 --> 02:23:02.720]  Well, why are so many getting into sex work?
[02:23:02.720 --> 02:23:03.880]  Why are so many committing suicide?
[02:23:03.880 --> 02:23:07.320]  And they blame conservatives who are saying this is dangerous as if we made them kill
[02:23:07.320 --> 02:23:08.320]  themselves.
[02:23:08.320 --> 02:23:09.320]  Right.
[02:23:09.320 --> 02:23:14.720]  So the sex work part is that historically, I mean, there's a, there's just a market for
[02:23:14.720 --> 02:23:15.720]  it.
[02:23:15.720 --> 02:23:17.960]  I mean, if you're a trans woman, the trans men thing, no, but if you're a trans woman,
[02:23:17.960 --> 02:23:19.720]  it's like there is a market for it.
[02:23:19.720 --> 02:23:23.520]  And so they make a lot of money if they look decent.
[02:23:23.520 --> 02:23:26.960]  So that was how they kind of worked back in the day when there was more of a social
[02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:29.080]  stigma and they couldn't get hired at target or whatever.
[02:23:29.080 --> 02:23:33.640]  Now Starbucks will hire you if your chance, there's really no reason to do it anymore.
[02:23:33.640 --> 02:23:38.880]  But as far as them killing themselves, I have, I think an interesting perspective on that.
[02:23:38.880 --> 02:23:45.640]  I don't necessarily believe the suicide statistics coming out of that because they, even conservatives,
[02:23:45.640 --> 02:23:51.440]  when they cite the suicide statistics, they cite them mainly from like gay organizations
[02:23:51.440 --> 02:23:53.760]  that are just reporting what they want.
[02:23:53.760 --> 02:23:54.760]  Right.
[02:23:54.760 --> 02:23:59.960]  And to the, to like GLAAD and the Trevor Project and all these, you know, massive corporation
[02:23:59.960 --> 02:24:04.680]  or, you know, organizations that are pro gay and pro trans, they feel that if they put
[02:24:04.680 --> 02:24:07.200]  it out there that, you know, trans people are killing themselves.
[02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:10.720]  They think they're portraying a situation that, you know, trans people are victims and
[02:24:10.720 --> 02:24:13.160]  they think that's a good thing to portray them that way because it makes people have
[02:24:13.160 --> 02:24:14.720]  empathy and sympathy.
[02:24:14.720 --> 02:24:19.640]  Whereas to the outside world, it just makes them look like suicidal taking time bombs.
[02:24:19.640 --> 02:24:24.200]  So there's so many numbers that come out of, you know, groups like that for trans that
[02:24:24.200 --> 02:24:25.200]  aren't even accurate.
[02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:29.200]  Like they just rescinded one where they said the average life expectancy of a trans woman
[02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:32.760]  was 35 and they just took it back after having that out for like decades.
[02:24:32.760 --> 02:24:34.760]  And they're like, Oh, actually that's just prostitutes.
[02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:38.600]  They got that number from prostitutes.
[02:24:38.600 --> 02:24:39.760]  Why is government pushing it?
[02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:46.240]  I think just to confuse all the roles, get rid of the family, have human animal hybrids,
[02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:47.240]  chimeras.
[02:24:47.240 --> 02:24:49.800]  I mean, I think it's just anything goes basically.
[02:24:49.800 --> 02:24:50.800]  Okay.
[02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:51.800]  Yeah.
[02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:55.400]  I mean, there's clearly a trajectory that they're on, right?
[02:24:55.400 --> 02:24:57.400]  It's like trans is just one leg of it.
[02:24:57.400 --> 02:24:59.800]  It's one, it's one piece of the puzzle.
[02:24:59.800 --> 02:25:02.680]  And then again, the over medicalization in general of the children.
[02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:06.460]  I mean, if you have a kid who maybe isn't paying attention so much in class or just
[02:25:06.460 --> 02:25:11.240]  exhibiting normal behaviors, they're put on 60 milligrams of Adderall every day, just meth,
[02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:12.880]  you know, speed.
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:18.080]  So we, we over medicalized people in general, which is a huge problem because there's profit.
[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:19.080]  People seem to be blinded.
[02:25:19.080 --> 02:25:22.119]  The fact that there's a profit behind all the trans stuff, a massive profit and the
[02:25:22.119 --> 02:25:24.480]  mad scientists want us to opt into experiments.
[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:26.119]  So this is the perfect way to do it.
[02:25:26.119 --> 02:25:27.119]  The Nazi motherfuckers.
[02:25:27.119 --> 02:25:28.119]  Sorry.
[02:25:28.119 --> 02:25:29.119]  I know.
[02:25:29.119 --> 02:25:30.119]  No, you're right.
[02:25:30.119 --> 02:25:31.119]  They are Nazi.
[02:25:31.119 --> 02:25:32.119]  They got the playbook.
[02:25:32.119 --> 02:25:33.119]  Nazi motherfuckers.
[02:25:33.119 --> 02:25:37.320]  I was talking to Roseanne Barr the other day and she's like obviously big into Nazi history
[02:25:37.320 --> 02:25:40.200]  and all that because she's a Jew and she's against Nazis.
[02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:41.200]  One on one.
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:42.200]  Duh.
[02:25:42.520 --> 02:25:43.520]  I've never read the news.
[02:25:43.520 --> 02:25:44.520]  She's for him.
[02:25:44.520 --> 02:25:45.520]  Right.
[02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:46.520]  Right.
[02:25:46.520 --> 02:25:47.520]  That was an amazing.
[02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:48.520]  I am too, supposedly.
[02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:49.520]  But yeah.
[02:25:49.520 --> 02:25:50.520]  How dare they?
[02:25:50.520 --> 02:25:54.200]  I mean, Kanye was here and you seemed like the most like pro troopers that ever compared
[02:25:54.200 --> 02:25:55.200]  to him.
[02:25:55.200 --> 02:25:56.200]  I mean, I was not.
[02:25:56.200 --> 02:25:57.200]  Well, I mean, the Jews aren't perfect.
[02:25:57.200 --> 02:25:58.200]  Nobody is.
[02:25:58.200 --> 02:25:59.200]  But Hitler was really bad.
[02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:00.200]  Right.
[02:26:00.200 --> 02:26:01.200]  Right.
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:02.200]  I mean, that's just one on one.
[02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:05.440]  But but yeah, but Roseanne was telling me it's like, you know, all this is just straight
[02:26:05.440 --> 02:26:06.960]  out of the Nazi playbook history.
[02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:07.960]  Nothing's new under the sun.
[02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:11.680]  Everything's a repeat of like history before, but they're just taking it to the next level.
[02:26:12.160 --> 02:26:16.520]  So where do you that there you are with with with Roseanne Barr recently?
[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:18.560]  Where do you see this ending?
[02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:24.000]  Because they're doubling down, they've attached pedophilia to trends agenda, which is a corporate
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:25.000]  agenda.
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.119]  You know, you see the whole Dylan Mulvaney thing.
[02:26:27.119 --> 02:26:31.480]  And as our Bush, I mean, the man has a Bush had used a spokesman probably would have increased
[02:26:31.480 --> 02:26:32.480]  their market cap.
[02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:37.240]  She'd be like, hey, I love America and I'm trans and don't hate me that people go.
[02:26:37.240 --> 02:26:38.240]  I get that.
[02:26:38.240 --> 02:26:39.240]  But it's my phone background.
[02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:40.240]  Well, let me say it.
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:42.040]  If I was overhead shot.
[02:26:42.040 --> 02:26:43.040]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:44.040]  So.
[02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:45.040]  So overhead shot, guys.
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:50.200]  So this is what they probably should have done over at over at Bud Light, but they didn't
[02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:51.200]  do that.
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:53.600]  I mean, Dylan Mulvaney is super creepy.
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:56.200]  What I think Mulvaney is trolling people or is mentally ill.
[02:26:56.200 --> 02:26:59.520]  I mean, he has zero feminine aspect.
[02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:03.960]  Well, that's the thing about most people getting psyoped into believing they're trans now.
[02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:06.160]  You know, I felt this way without any influence.
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:07.440]  Let me make that clear.
[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:09.320]  Like what influence could I have had at four?
[02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:10.920]  This is before anyone really knew what it was.
[02:27:10.920 --> 02:27:12.640]  You know, this is something that was always persistent.
[02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:13.640]  Whereas now.
[02:27:13.640 --> 02:27:15.160]  So you were into Barbies.
[02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:16.160]  You were, you know.
[02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:17.160]  Yeah.
[02:27:17.160 --> 02:27:18.160]  Yeah.
[02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:19.160]  I was trying to steal my cousin's Barbies and all that.
[02:27:19.160 --> 02:27:22.119]  I was having visions of war and like just when I was four.
[02:27:22.119 --> 02:27:24.160]  So I was kind of male.
[02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:25.160]  Right.
[02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:26.160]  Right.
[02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:30.960]  Whereas, you know, Dylan Mulvaney, there's videos of him being very, very comfortable
[02:27:30.960 --> 02:27:35.160]  being male on talks or on game shows and, you know, other videos he did.
[02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:38.560]  Whereas like back before I transitioned, I would never be caught dead on camera.
[02:27:38.800 --> 02:27:39.800]  I was scared of cameras.
[02:27:39.800 --> 02:27:42.240]  I would never want to be seen because I was not comfortable with it.
[02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:43.240]  You thought it wasn't you?
[02:27:43.240 --> 02:27:44.240]  Yeah.
[02:27:44.240 --> 02:27:45.240]  Yeah.
[02:27:45.240 --> 02:27:46.240]  Yeah.
[02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:48.520]  Well, it's a very human attribute as a species.
[02:27:48.520 --> 02:27:49.520]  We change our environment.
[02:27:49.520 --> 02:27:50.920]  We change ourselves.
[02:27:50.920 --> 02:27:51.920]  And adults have a right to do that.
[02:27:51.920 --> 02:27:52.920]  I respect that.
[02:27:52.920 --> 02:27:53.920]  Right.
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:56.920]  Just don't push it on kids because otherwise you're going to hell for that.
[02:27:56.920 --> 02:27:57.920]  Well, that's right.
[02:27:57.920 --> 02:27:58.920]  I want to go to break.
[02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:00.320]  I'm trying to get you.
[02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:01.320]  What else do you want?
[02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:02.320]  Because this is an amazing interview, Blair.
[02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:03.840]  We're so glad you're here.
[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:05.320]  And they'll go like, Joe's a hypocrite.
[02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:06.320]  He had Blair White on.
[02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:07.320]  He hates trans.
[02:28:07.320 --> 02:28:08.320]  No, no.
[02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:10.080]  I'm targeting children just like you do.
[02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:11.080]  Right.
[02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:12.080]  Right.
[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:13.080]  You know, it's.
[02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:14.080]  And I don't feel threatened when I go to sleep at night that you exist.
[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:15.080]  I feel good.
[02:28:15.080 --> 02:28:16.080]  You exist.
[02:28:16.080 --> 02:28:17.080]  Thank you.
[02:28:17.080 --> 02:28:20.400]  I mean, it's at the end of the day, you know, you're either contributing positively to the
[02:28:20.400 --> 02:28:21.400]  world or you're not.
[02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:24.840]  And what someone does with their own body without pushing it on someone else, it's like, what
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:26.240]  does that do to anyone but themselves?
[02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:27.680]  I'll go with the spirit.
[02:28:27.680 --> 02:28:28.880]  I don't feel threatened by you.
[02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:29.880]  I feel good.
[02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:30.880]  We're more than this.
[02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:31.880]  Right.
[02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:32.880]  Exactly.
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:33.880]  We are.
[02:28:33.880 --> 02:28:34.880]  We have spirits.
[02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:35.880]  And I feel good when I see Bill Gates.
[02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:36.880]  I go, I'm going to war.
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:37.880]  Right.
[02:28:38.440 --> 02:28:39.440]  Oh, that's the devil.
[02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:40.440]  That's the bad guy.
[02:28:40.440 --> 02:28:41.440]  Right.
[02:28:41.440 --> 02:28:42.440]  Right.
[02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:43.440]  And because we are more than this.
[02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:44.440]  I struggle with spirituality.
[02:28:44.440 --> 02:28:45.440]  But I do believe in more than this.
[02:28:45.440 --> 02:28:46.440]  Well, we're going to.
[02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:47.440]  We're going to get you.
[02:28:47.440 --> 02:28:48.440]  We're going to.
[02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:49.440]  We're going to get you on board with Jesus.
[02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:50.440]  We'll be right back with Blair White.
[02:28:50.440 --> 02:28:51.440]  Stay with us.
[02:28:51.440 --> 02:28:52.440]  Oh, my God.
[02:28:52.440 --> 02:28:53.440]  They found the picture.
[02:28:53.440 --> 02:28:54.440]  Oh, great.
[02:28:54.440 --> 02:28:55.440]  For everything the globalists hit us with.
[02:28:55.440 --> 02:28:56.440]  God, through Mother Nature, has given us the answer.

[02:33:08.470 --> 02:33:19.470]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.470 --> 02:33:33.470]  When castles towered over vast landscapes and knights championed honor and valor, there came an unforeseen darkness.
[02:33:33.470 --> 02:33:40.470]  Amidst this impending doom stood a knight called Alex Jones, a brave and outspoken herald known as the Truth Sayer.
[02:33:40.470 --> 02:33:48.470]  Sir Alex Jones was not alone. In his most desperate hour in the battle against evil, a radiant light descended from the heavens.
[02:33:48.470 --> 02:33:53.470]  God, in all his glory and his legion of angels, stood by Alex's side.
[02:33:53.470 --> 02:33:58.470]  The battle raged on, but with every blow, Alex Jones' conviction grew stronger.
[02:33:59.470 --> 02:34:03.470]  With every truth he proclaimed, the demonic forces faltered.
[02:34:03.470 --> 02:34:11.470]  When the enemy was vanquished, Alex Jones swore a solemn oath that should the realm need him again, he would return.
[02:34:11.470 --> 02:34:13.470]  And now it's Alex Jones.
[02:34:13.470 --> 02:34:17.470]  Leading a full frontal assault on the satanic New World Order.

[02:34:28.470 --> 02:34:39.470]  God designed this planet where we slowly genetically change, not their mainline evolution, but we do mutate.
[02:34:39.470 --> 02:34:44.470]  White people are a mutation of black people. That's in the scientific literature. It's a fact.
[02:34:44.470 --> 02:34:50.470]  So I'm not saying Blair White is some horrible mutant or abomination.
[02:34:50.470 --> 02:34:56.470]  I'm simply saying that they're giving us shots now that make us allergic to meat for life.
[02:34:56.470 --> 02:34:59.470]  That is a trans attack.
[02:34:59.470 --> 02:35:10.470]  And so people that persevere and overcome what's been done to them, you can only see them as a fellow human who's not a bad person.
[02:35:10.470 --> 02:35:16.470]  What matters is what they stand for and what they do. But make no mistake, this is genetic for most people.
[02:35:16.470 --> 02:35:22.470]  They're trying to make a culture where, you know, in Oregon and Washington State, 40% of the kids say they're, quote, gay.
[02:35:22.470 --> 02:35:24.470]  That's brainwashing.
[02:35:24.470 --> 02:35:27.470]  And Blair talks about that. That's being done on purpose.
[02:35:27.470 --> 02:35:34.470]  But we cannot deny that the frogs want to have sex with male frogs because this chemical did it and it does it to humans.
[02:35:34.470 --> 02:35:40.470]  We don't hate those frogs. We hate the fact their population is plummeting and it's all about depopulation.
[02:35:40.470 --> 02:35:45.470]  And the U.N. says this agenda is about us not having children and getting rid of people.
[02:35:45.470 --> 02:35:51.470]  But then people that have been attacked and we've all been hit in different ways, we don't then hate them.
[02:35:51.470 --> 02:35:56.470]  We have to reach out to them as a coalition to understand what's being done to us.
[02:35:56.470 --> 02:35:59.470]  We're being manipulated. We're being controlled.
[02:35:59.470 --> 02:36:04.470]  You wanted to get into a whole bunch of issues that are political, that are separate, because, you know,
[02:36:04.470 --> 02:36:09.470]  you're obviously trans and a very interesting, smart person, and we're obsessing on that the last hour.
[02:36:09.470 --> 02:36:12.470]  We'll do 15 minutes the next hour that Drew Hernandez takes over.
[02:36:12.470 --> 02:36:17.470]  But you've got a lot of other things that just aren't about you, who you are and your identity.
[02:36:17.470 --> 02:36:22.470]  And I get it. It's kind of like if I was on the show, let's talk about how you're a man for two hours.
[02:36:22.470 --> 02:36:26.470]  What it's like. What else is on your radar? What else is going on?
[02:36:26.470 --> 02:36:32.470]  I mean, just so much, you know, obviously, I feel like the entire planet went through a really,
[02:36:32.470 --> 02:36:37.470]  really terrifying psyop and social experiment with COVID and with lockdowns.
[02:36:37.470 --> 02:36:42.470]  And, you know, about a year and a half ago, maybe it was like when I first got to Texas,
[02:36:42.470 --> 02:36:46.470]  we went to dinner, you and I and some friends. And I asked you, what's next?
[02:36:46.470 --> 02:36:51.470]  And you said climate lockdowns. And at the time, there was nothing in the media about it.
[02:36:51.470 --> 02:36:53.470]  There's no one talking about was on no one's radar.
[02:36:53.470 --> 02:36:59.470]  And now all of a sudden I'm seeing headlines about how, you know, blackouts may be the cure for climate change.
[02:36:59.470 --> 02:37:04.470]  You know, rolling blackouts. And then I'm remembering, oh, when I lived in L.A., there was a lot of blackouts.
[02:37:04.470 --> 02:37:10.470]  They were like shutting off the power in huge parts of the city for like a day at a time, you know, and it was like a whole thing.
[02:37:10.470 --> 02:37:13.470]  So and the government districts are exempt. Right.
[02:37:13.470 --> 02:37:18.470]  So it's very interesting to me how, you know, people discount you a lot.
[02:37:18.470 --> 02:37:21.470]  People discount both of us. I mean, in many ways, we're underdogs.
[02:37:21.470 --> 02:37:25.470]  But, you know, stuff like that. I'm like, OK, you can say what you want about Alex Jones.
[02:37:25.470 --> 02:37:29.470]  You can say what you want about whatever. You're right about a lot of shit.
[02:37:29.470 --> 02:37:34.470]  You know, I'd never heard of climate lockdowns until you said it to me in private with nothing else on camera.
[02:37:35.470 --> 02:37:40.470]  And then all of a sudden it's coming out in the media that that's like clearly the trajectory they're on.
[02:37:40.470 --> 02:37:42.470]  Well, I like to act smart, but they put it in all their documents.
[02:37:42.470 --> 02:37:49.470]  So what do you think about Trump and the indictments and just America and the world in general?
[02:37:49.470 --> 02:37:53.470]  I think, you know. I'm really scared of the election year.
[02:37:53.470 --> 02:37:58.470]  I mean, the last election year was hell on Earth. You know, they shut the entire planet down for it.
[02:37:58.470 --> 02:38:02.470]  It was terrifying. So I'm not looking forward to living in fear.
[02:38:02.470 --> 02:38:07.470]  God knows. I'm sure BLM will come back. You know, I'm sure all the cities will be burning again.
[02:38:07.470 --> 02:38:09.470]  Mostly peaceful. Right.
[02:38:09.470 --> 02:38:14.470]  And then I'm sure everyone will be gaslit into thinking that the people who are just defending their house,
[02:38:14.470 --> 02:38:19.470]  defending their property are the bad people and the people invading it.
[02:38:19.470 --> 02:38:24.470]  And, you know, violating them in that way are the people you have to defend, which is insane.
[02:38:24.470 --> 02:38:29.470]  I think of that couple, like with the guy, the viral couple was like East St. Louis.
[02:38:29.470 --> 02:38:31.470]  Yeah. And I remember, like, just how.
[02:38:31.470 --> 02:38:32.470]  The McCloskeys.
[02:38:32.470 --> 02:38:36.470]  Right, right. I mean, their relationship goals for me, I mean, they were amazing.
[02:38:36.470 --> 02:38:40.470]  But I remember it was the wildest thing for me to see the way in which people reacted to them.
[02:38:40.470 --> 02:38:46.470]  I'm like, in what world do you not react to rioters coming onto your yard by holding a gun and just letting them know.
[02:38:46.470 --> 02:38:48.470]  And breaking down your fence.
[02:38:48.470 --> 02:38:52.470]  Right. Well, that was why I left L.A., because it was just so unsafe.
[02:38:52.470 --> 02:38:55.470]  And, you know, I had one like little like baby Glock when I lived there.
[02:38:55.470 --> 02:38:59.470]  And now I have 20 guns on that. I'm in Texas because you can hear.
[02:38:59.470 --> 02:39:01.470]  But that's the point that it's like these blue cities.
[02:39:01.470 --> 02:39:06.470]  You have to you're forced to live in fear and you're gas lit into thinking that that fear isn't valid.
[02:39:06.470 --> 02:39:09.470]  Right. There was like a tick tock the other day.
[02:39:09.470 --> 02:39:12.470]  Do you see the tick tock of like the woman who got spit on in San Francisco?
[02:39:12.470 --> 02:39:14.470]  Talk about that. Pull that up. I meant to cover that.
[02:39:14.470 --> 02:39:18.470]  I mentioned it, but yeah. Another people get beat up.
[02:39:18.470 --> 02:39:23.470]  Yeah. And, you know, a lot of maybe speaking in San Francisco, a lot of, you know,
[02:39:23.470 --> 02:39:26.470]  Asians are getting beat up by a white supremacist demographic as well.
[02:39:26.470 --> 02:39:30.470]  So the amount of gaslighting that goes on is scary.
[02:39:30.470 --> 02:39:35.470]  And just knowing how bad it can get, which was what we saw over the past few years,
[02:39:35.470 --> 02:39:37.470]  like I'm not looking forward to the election year at all.
[02:39:37.470 --> 02:39:41.470]  And I'm not looking forward to whatever societal consequences are going to come from.
[02:39:41.470 --> 02:39:44.470]  You know what happens? I'm genuinely asking.
[02:39:44.470 --> 02:39:49.470]  I don't know what happens if Trump wins from behind bars or, you know,
[02:39:49.470 --> 02:39:51.470]  because I don't think it's beneath them to put him behind bars.
[02:39:51.470 --> 02:39:53.470]  They're going to try that. Let's talk about it.
[02:39:53.470 --> 02:39:56.470]  You're as bad as I am, Blair White, about not promoting yourself on other shows.
[02:39:56.470 --> 02:39:59.470]  I just did Jimmy the Bull Gravano for two hours yesterday.
[02:39:59.470 --> 02:40:02.470]  It's going to air next week. And I didn't realize till the very end,
[02:40:02.470 --> 02:40:05.470]  I never plugged in full wars dot com or I'm censored.
[02:40:05.470 --> 02:40:07.470]  I'm still on air. Please find the link. Please share it.
[02:40:07.470 --> 02:40:09.470]  That's key to fight the censorship.
[02:40:09.470 --> 02:40:11.470]  You've not said one time where you're at Blair White,
[02:40:11.470 --> 02:40:15.470]  YouTube dot com forward slash Blair White, Twitter dot com forward slash M.S.
[02:40:15.470 --> 02:40:19.470]  Blair White, M.S. Blair White dot com.
[02:40:19.470 --> 02:40:22.470]  Yeah. So I have YouTube. I have Instagram. I have Twitter.
[02:40:22.470 --> 02:40:25.470]  I have a podcast channel. It's exploded. Yeah.
[02:40:25.470 --> 02:40:28.470]  Yeah. I've been very lucky to have like an amazing longevity with it.
[02:40:28.470 --> 02:40:32.470]  Like I said, eight years have over a million subscribers on my main channel.
[02:40:32.470 --> 02:40:36.470]  And I kind of have like a cult following, which is really cool.
[02:40:36.470 --> 02:40:39.470]  And, you know, anything you want to see me talk about,
[02:40:39.470 --> 02:40:40.470]  I pretty much talk about it on there.
[02:40:40.470 --> 02:40:43.470]  When I read the comments, when I've been on your show a few times,
[02:40:43.470 --> 02:40:46.470]  there's tens of thousands like I thought he hated me.
[02:40:46.470 --> 02:40:49.470]  I thought he was, you know, right. But you know what?
[02:40:49.470 --> 02:40:54.470]  The gag of it is I wouldn't even do an interview with you if I felt that way,
[02:40:54.470 --> 02:40:55.470]  even a little bit.
[02:40:55.470 --> 02:40:57.470]  So it's like I was talking about this the other day with Roseanne.
[02:40:57.470 --> 02:40:59.470]  Actually, I don't remember if it was on camera or not,
[02:40:59.470 --> 02:41:03.470]  but it was the people who are treated as the most villainous,
[02:41:03.470 --> 02:41:07.470]  like on sort of like the right side of the political spectrum.
[02:41:07.470 --> 02:41:11.470]  The libs who think they're like these ones are the worst.
[02:41:11.470 --> 02:41:12.470]  They're usually the best people.
[02:41:12.470 --> 02:41:15.470]  Whereas the ones who have the prettier image are behind the scenes evil.
[02:41:15.470 --> 02:41:18.470]  So it's like you're villainized so much and you're actually a good person
[02:41:18.470 --> 02:41:19.470]  behind the scenes.
[02:41:19.470 --> 02:41:22.470]  And I see a lot of other people who have, you know, pretty, you know,
[02:41:22.470 --> 02:41:25.470]  neutral images in the media, even by liberal standards.
[02:41:25.470 --> 02:41:28.470]  And like, they're actually like the devils behind the scenes doing deviant
[02:41:28.470 --> 02:41:29.470]  shit and just being bad people.
[02:41:29.470 --> 02:41:33.470]  So I can ask you a thousand questions. We've got a few more segments left.
[02:41:33.470 --> 02:41:35.470]  We'll go some in the next hour, but what else are you looking at?
[02:41:35.470 --> 02:41:36.470]  What else are you concerned about?
[02:41:36.470 --> 02:41:40.470]  I am concerned about AI.
[02:41:41.470 --> 02:41:45.470]  I feel like we're right at the last few moments of anything being real.
[02:41:45.470 --> 02:41:48.470]  Absolutely. Humans changing themselves is the least of our problem.
[02:41:48.470 --> 02:41:50.470]  I mean, we've got a robot takeover.
[02:41:50.470 --> 02:41:54.470]  Right. Well, I think we're literally living in the last days.
[02:41:54.470 --> 02:41:55.470]  And I say days literally,
[02:41:55.470 --> 02:41:59.470]  like probably the next year of anything being real.
[02:41:59.470 --> 02:42:01.470]  I mean, I've fallen for deep fake AI's.
[02:42:01.470 --> 02:42:04.470]  I got a fake Tucker Carlson call and they spoofed the number.
[02:42:04.470 --> 02:42:08.470]  It's Tucker Carlson's number. He calls, he says,
[02:42:08.470 --> 02:42:11.470]  Tucker Carlson, I don't have sex with you. And I'm like, Tucker, this is AI.
[02:42:11.470 --> 02:42:15.470]  And that's all they got. Wow. I mean, that's, I got it immediately.
[02:42:15.470 --> 02:42:16.470]  I'm like Tucker Carlson.
[02:42:16.470 --> 02:42:20.470]  But like people kidnap a girl or they record her voice off Tik TOK and call
[02:42:20.470 --> 02:42:22.470]  the mom, mom, help me. I've been kidnapped.
[02:42:22.470 --> 02:42:24.470]  The mother gives them a hundred thousand dollars.
[02:42:24.470 --> 02:42:27.470]  There's deep fake porn of me. I get sent like,
[02:42:27.470 --> 02:42:31.470]  is this you in this video, in this picture? And I'm like, no,
[02:42:31.470 --> 02:42:35.470]  I've never taken a new dimension in my life, but there's deep fake porn.
[02:42:35.470 --> 02:42:37.470]  So it's like, anyone can just be a porn star now,
[02:42:37.470 --> 02:42:40.470]  whether or not you partake in it at all. So that's scary.
[02:42:40.470 --> 02:42:41.470]  Terrifying actually.
[02:42:41.470 --> 02:42:46.470]  We need discernment now more than ever. Blair White is our guest.
[02:42:46.470 --> 02:42:50.470]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, Blair White,

[02:45:31.470 --> 02:45:36.470]  which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain.
[02:45:36.470 --> 02:45:38.470]  There's major research behind this all.

[02:45:57.470 --> 02:46:02.470]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[02:46:02.470 --> 02:46:05.470]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress,
[02:46:05.470 --> 02:46:11.470]  you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.

[02:46:56.600 --> 02:47:06.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:07.400 --> 02:47:35.160]  Well, Blair White is in studio with us.
[02:47:35.160 --> 02:47:40.160]  We appreciate Blair White joining us, I'm Alex Jones, your host, we have Drew Hernandez
[02:47:40.160 --> 02:47:43.640]  coming up here in about 30 minutes, we'll do about 15 minutes the next hour.
[02:47:43.640 --> 02:47:45.520]  You want to talk about God.
[02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:47.160]  Let's talk about God, Blair.
[02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:52.500]  Yeah, earlier we were just getting into this concept of being more than our bodies.
[02:47:52.500 --> 02:47:58.320]  And obviously as someone who has, you know, done a lot to my body, I feel like maybe people
[02:47:58.320 --> 02:48:02.880]  would think I'm less connected to that concept because of it, but I actually think I'm more.
[02:48:02.880 --> 02:48:07.119]  Because, you know, even though it helps me in like the trans aspect, it made me happier
[02:48:07.119 --> 02:48:08.119]  in that front.
[02:48:08.119 --> 02:48:13.600]  It doesn't actually bring you, you know, any deep sense of fulfillment, you know, and right
[02:48:13.600 --> 02:48:18.119]  now I feel like we live in a society that is very much focused on just like the shell.
[02:48:18.119 --> 02:48:22.160]  And the older I get, I feel like it's apparent that we're more than just our bodies, which
[02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:25.920]  is why, like you said, if you're sitting in a room with me, you can, you know, have an
[02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:28.520]  instinctual like, this is a good person.
[02:48:28.520 --> 02:48:32.119]  And if you're sitting in a room with Bill Gates, you can get an instinctual need to like, you
[02:48:32.119 --> 02:48:33.840]  know, a fight or flight basically.
[02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:38.480]  So that I think is proof for more than our bodies, you know, I agree.
[02:48:38.480 --> 02:48:39.480]  Elaborate.
[02:48:39.480 --> 02:48:40.480]  Yeah.
[02:48:40.480 --> 02:48:46.359]  I just feel like, you know, for a long time, I never said I was an atheist, but I definitely
[02:48:46.359 --> 02:48:48.160]  didn't really care about the concept of God.
[02:48:48.160 --> 02:48:53.000]  But with the way the world has gone the past few years, I find myself gravitating more
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:56.760]  towards it, you know, not necessarily in a religious sense.
[02:48:56.760 --> 02:48:57.760]  Maybe I should.
[02:48:57.760 --> 02:48:58.760]  I don't know.
[02:48:58.760 --> 02:49:01.680]  Just in an overall spiritual sense.
[02:49:01.680 --> 02:49:06.000]  Well, the system is religious, but there's a real spiritual sense that's happening.
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:07.000]  Right.
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:10.640]  I mean, all the political stuff we've been talking about this whole episode is all religion
[02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:12.279]  in many ways.
[02:49:12.279 --> 02:49:17.840]  How do you see the corporate system hitching its wagon to the transgender movement and
[02:49:17.840 --> 02:49:18.840]  all this?
[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:19.840]  How do you see that unfolding?
[02:49:19.840 --> 02:49:25.000]  Because we have Greg Abbott signs law banning trans athletes from college sports amid dents
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:26.000]  in protests.
[02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:30.920]  Protesters oppose Texas Governor Abbott's signing of Save Women's Sports Act, and it
[02:49:30.920 --> 02:49:31.920]  just goes on and on.
[02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:36.039]  Ron DeSantis attempts to erase trans people from Florida schools is now underway.
[02:49:36.039 --> 02:49:38.119]  Governor, it just goes on and on.
[02:49:38.119 --> 02:49:39.119]  I mean, so many.
[02:49:39.119 --> 02:49:41.840]  Where do you see this fight going?
[02:49:41.840 --> 02:49:45.760]  I think that it's going to continue, obviously, to be a state by state thing and different
[02:49:45.760 --> 02:49:47.279]  states are going to have different laws.
[02:49:47.279 --> 02:49:51.199]  I mean, you know, those are examples, of course, of like right wing states pushing back.
[02:49:51.199 --> 02:49:56.160]  But you look at the blue states and California's a sanctuary state for trans kids.
[02:49:56.160 --> 02:50:01.199]  You can take your kid and get a sex change in California, whereas you can't in Florida,
[02:50:01.199 --> 02:50:02.199]  which is insane.
[02:50:02.199 --> 02:50:06.760]  I mean, I believe in state rights, but the idea that the state has the right to abuse
[02:50:06.760 --> 02:50:10.160]  children, I don't think that falls under a state right.
[02:50:10.160 --> 02:50:11.160]  So it's pretty terrifying.
[02:50:11.160 --> 02:50:14.720]  I mean, there is that case you probably you've heard of this case.
[02:50:14.720 --> 02:50:17.960]  There was like the dad who lost custody of his child.
[02:50:17.960 --> 02:50:18.960]  Texas.
[02:50:18.960 --> 02:50:19.960]  Yeah, that was here.
[02:50:19.960 --> 02:50:22.760]  I mean, look, look at look at Washington state where they're going to take kids and not tell
[02:50:22.760 --> 02:50:24.320]  the parents where they are.
[02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:25.320]  Right.
[02:50:25.320 --> 02:50:28.400]  But then anyone who thinks that that's not connected to communism, I mean, that's basic
[02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:29.400]  one on one.
[02:50:29.400 --> 02:50:30.960]  That's the state feeling like they have ownership over your child.
[02:50:30.960 --> 02:50:31.960]  You belong to the state.
[02:50:31.960 --> 02:50:32.960]  You don't belong to your family.
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:34.320]  You don't belong to your parents.
[02:50:34.320 --> 02:50:38.560]  So, yeah, the whole world is trending in that direction.
[02:50:38.560 --> 02:50:44.320]  So I'm not saying I'm super alpha male masculine, but I think I was masculine when I was three,
[02:50:44.320 --> 02:50:45.320]  four or five years old.
[02:50:45.320 --> 02:50:52.160]  My earliest memories were like war and fighting and and and and like weapon systems and guns
[02:50:52.160 --> 02:50:53.760]  without even even people.
[02:50:53.760 --> 02:50:55.640]  My parents weren't trying to get me to be like that.
[02:50:55.640 --> 02:50:57.760]  I was like.
[02:50:57.760 --> 02:50:59.800]  Super aggressive in politics, history.
[02:50:59.800 --> 02:51:02.800]  I was attracted to geopolitical systems.
[02:51:02.800 --> 02:51:09.240]  I was I was totally like on fire with with masculine energy.
[02:51:09.240 --> 02:51:10.440]  What is it like for you when you were little?
[02:51:10.440 --> 02:51:12.000]  You were like, what were you attracted to?
[02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:15.199]  You said you were this proclivity towards a feminine very early.
[02:51:15.199 --> 02:51:16.199]  What was it like?
[02:51:16.199 --> 02:51:17.199]  Yeah.
[02:51:17.199 --> 02:51:22.920]  You know, I definitely had like the world wanting to suppress it a bit.
[02:51:22.920 --> 02:51:25.000]  You know, my dad didn't want like a kid like that.
[02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:26.520]  He wasn't abusive for us because of it.
[02:51:26.520 --> 02:51:27.520]  But what were you doing though?
[02:51:27.520 --> 02:51:30.800]  You were like, oh, yeah, I would steal my cousin's Barbies.
[02:51:30.800 --> 02:51:37.680]  I would, you know, watch shows that were marketed towards young girls, you know, all that stuff,
[02:51:37.680 --> 02:51:39.560]  you know, all the sort of typical one on one.
[02:51:39.560 --> 02:51:46.279]  But the deeper part of that is like these libs will use things like that as a reason
[02:51:46.279 --> 02:51:49.800]  to trans a kid, because but at the end of the day, there are gay boys that like the
[02:51:49.800 --> 02:51:50.800]  color pink.
[02:51:50.800 --> 02:51:54.760]  You know, there are, you know, gay men who like those shows or do feminine things.
[02:51:54.760 --> 02:51:57.480]  So it is deeper than that, you know.
[02:51:57.480 --> 02:52:01.600]  And so I think that that goes into your argument that there clearly is like something chemical
[02:52:01.600 --> 02:52:02.900]  and there's levels to it.
[02:52:02.900 --> 02:52:04.760]  So maybe it just made you gay.
[02:52:04.760 --> 02:52:06.840]  Maybe it made you all the way trans.
[02:52:06.840 --> 02:52:08.920]  You know, there's clearly levels to it.
[02:52:09.279 --> 02:52:11.240]  And the studies show that in other animals.
[02:52:11.240 --> 02:52:12.600]  It's not like this is an opinion.
[02:52:12.600 --> 02:52:13.600]  Right.
[02:52:13.600 --> 02:52:19.119]  And I believe that because a lot of people like we'll talk about, like, as an example,
[02:52:19.119 --> 02:52:21.000]  gay men like they'll be like, oh, why do they walk like that?
[02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:22.880]  Why do they talk like that?
[02:52:22.880 --> 02:52:25.520]  Clearly if they're all doing it, it's not like a choice, like they have those natural
[02:52:25.520 --> 02:52:26.520]  tendencies.
[02:52:26.520 --> 02:52:27.520]  So that's chemical.
[02:52:27.520 --> 02:52:30.760]  You know, your body instructs your brain, instructs how to walk.
[02:52:30.760 --> 02:52:34.160]  So men walk a certain way, women walk a certain way.
[02:52:34.160 --> 02:52:37.000]  And the brain kind of instructs that because we're also built differently.
[02:52:37.080 --> 02:52:40.119]  So wider hips on women, more shoulders on men.
[02:52:40.119 --> 02:52:41.560]  And so that's how you walk.
[02:52:41.560 --> 02:52:42.560]  Men walk with their shoulders.
[02:52:42.560 --> 02:52:43.560]  Women walk with their hips.
[02:52:43.560 --> 02:52:46.640]  So if you see a population of males walking with their hips, you can assume it's probably
[02:52:46.640 --> 02:52:48.520]  something chemical.
[02:52:48.520 --> 02:52:49.520]  And we know it is.
[02:52:49.520 --> 02:52:55.240]  So you asked the question we first got on over an hour ago, why is the government pushing
[02:52:55.240 --> 02:52:56.240]  it then?
[02:52:56.240 --> 02:52:58.400]  Because I think they don't want the human system.
[02:52:58.400 --> 02:53:03.880]  We're not mad at anybody that's going against that or not who are, quote, been affected
[02:53:03.880 --> 02:53:04.880]  by this.
[02:53:04.960 --> 02:53:07.440]  There is an agenda to end the nuclear family.
[02:53:07.440 --> 02:53:09.119]  Oh, for sure.
[02:53:09.119 --> 02:53:10.119]  And you know what?
[02:53:10.119 --> 02:53:12.880]  It's so crazy because that's something I was aware of, even like as a really young kid,
[02:53:12.880 --> 02:53:14.480]  I would watch TV shows.
[02:53:14.480 --> 02:53:17.440]  And I remember actually picking up on the fact that fathers were devalued.
[02:53:17.440 --> 02:53:21.359]  Like as a kid, I'd be like, why is every dad in every show a clown?
[02:53:21.359 --> 02:53:25.600]  Why is every dad in every show like, you know, fat and gross and like, you know, the butt
[02:53:25.600 --> 02:53:26.600]  of the joke.
[02:53:26.600 --> 02:53:28.000]  And then, you know, the woman can do no wrong.
[02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:29.400]  I picked up not very young.
[02:53:29.400 --> 02:53:34.320]  I was like, OK, there's clearly a characterization happening here of males, right?
[02:53:34.760 --> 02:53:38.760]  So, you know, just the attack on the family in general is really sad.
[02:53:38.760 --> 02:53:42.880]  And you see it with the trans kids because they literally tell them to separate from
[02:53:42.880 --> 02:53:45.279]  their parents if their parents aren't fully on board.
[02:53:45.279 --> 02:53:46.279]  And that's emotional.
[02:53:46.279 --> 02:53:47.279]  What's the term they use?
[02:53:47.279 --> 02:53:48.279]  Like disconnection?
[02:53:48.279 --> 02:53:49.279]  Yeah.
[02:53:49.279 --> 02:53:50.279]  No contact or whatever.
[02:53:50.279 --> 02:53:51.720]  They tell them no contact.
[02:53:51.720 --> 02:53:57.840]  You know, have you seen that one crazy mother, that guy, Jeffrey Marsh on my tiptoe?
[02:53:57.840 --> 02:53:58.840]  Oh, yeah.
[02:53:58.840 --> 02:54:01.240]  I really tell kids like your parents are wrong.
[02:54:01.240 --> 02:54:04.480]  It's like, who are you to tell anyone that?
[02:54:04.480 --> 02:54:06.680]  And it's really up to parents to stop this.
[02:54:06.680 --> 02:54:11.640]  You're plugging your child into like a crystal ball that has these people on the other side
[02:54:11.640 --> 02:54:12.640]  of it.
[02:54:12.640 --> 02:54:14.160]  Well, why are so many?
[02:54:14.160 --> 02:54:17.359]  I'm not a parent so far, be it for me to judge, but I will judge.
[02:54:17.359 --> 02:54:21.720]  Actually, I can't believe how many people are OK with their kids having smartphones
[02:54:21.720 --> 02:54:28.000]  with, you know, unfiltered access to social media, Twitter, you know, X or Instagram.
[02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:31.920]  I mean, the amount of crazy stuff I scroll past that I probably even subconsciously filter
[02:54:31.920 --> 02:54:33.960]  out because I'm just so desensitized to it.
[02:54:33.960 --> 02:54:37.320]  These kids are seeing it for the first time and it's probably traumatizing them in many
[02:54:37.320 --> 02:54:38.320]  ways.
[02:54:38.320 --> 02:54:41.840]  What do you think of Elon Musk?
[02:54:41.840 --> 02:54:46.400]  I don't know him, but I think that he shouldn't have changed the name to X.
[02:54:46.400 --> 02:54:52.000]  Because, you know, Twitter had there's like a cultural reference, you know, people talk
[02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:53.000]  about tweeting and Twitter.
[02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.940]  It's like a cultural thing more than it is even a social media thing.
[02:54:55.940 --> 02:54:56.940]  So what do you say for X?
[02:54:56.940 --> 02:55:00.020]  Like, I don't know how to say I'm posting something on X to say post.
[02:55:00.020 --> 02:55:03.020]  It took away, you know, how easy it is to like talk about Twitter.
[02:55:03.020 --> 02:55:04.660]  But then again, I'm, you know.
[02:55:04.660 --> 02:55:06.699]  No, do you think it's for real?
[02:55:06.699 --> 02:55:09.900]  Oh, oh, for real.
[02:55:09.900 --> 02:55:10.900]  I feel like it could be a phase.
[02:55:10.900 --> 02:55:15.900]  I feel like many of the people that kind of start making more sense, it's almost a phase
[02:55:15.900 --> 02:55:17.820]  and they kind of go in and out of it.
[02:55:17.820 --> 02:55:21.500]  Because to me, if you're not that way from start, like if you don't see the world kind
[02:55:21.500 --> 02:55:25.340]  of for what it is, I understand people wake up all the time, but like I've always had
[02:55:25.340 --> 02:55:29.940]  sort of an instinctual, you know, intuition about what's evil and what isn't.
[02:55:29.940 --> 02:55:31.460]  And I've always been pretty much right.
[02:55:31.460 --> 02:55:36.539]  You know, it's so if you don't have that for all the years that he was in Hollywood, a leopard
[02:55:36.539 --> 02:55:38.100]  can't change the spots.
[02:55:38.100 --> 02:55:39.100]  Right.
[02:55:39.100 --> 02:55:40.100]  Right.
[02:55:40.100 --> 02:55:44.060]  I mean, I guess I kind of did in some ways, but yeah, one hundred percent, you know, so
[02:55:44.060 --> 02:55:46.740]  I don't ever trust necessarily the people who jump ship.
[02:55:46.740 --> 02:55:51.300]  I mean, look at Kanye, everyone was hailing him and then he had like a, you know, crazy
[02:55:51.300 --> 02:55:52.300]  episode.
[02:55:52.300 --> 02:55:53.820]  Now everyone kind of just is acting like it didn't happen.
[02:55:53.820 --> 02:55:57.420]  You know, these celebrities like to jump out, but at the end of the day, it's almost
[02:55:57.420 --> 02:55:58.420]  always a phase.
[02:55:58.420 --> 02:55:59.580]  And I guess he's more than a celebrity.
[02:55:59.580 --> 02:56:04.699]  But still, when you're gone later, we'll be on for another 20 minutes or so.
[02:56:04.699 --> 02:56:08.860]  Think about what you wanted to say and say it now.
[02:56:08.860 --> 02:56:15.580]  OK, you know, in my mind, before I came here, I was thinking the main thing I would like
[02:56:15.580 --> 02:56:19.340]  to impart on people is individualism.
[02:56:19.340 --> 02:56:22.660]  You know, I believe in individualism, not collectivism.
[02:56:22.660 --> 02:56:23.699]  And that's how I've lived my life.
[02:56:24.580 --> 02:56:25.580]  And that's why I'm here.
[02:56:25.580 --> 02:56:28.980]  And that's why I can be myself, be a transsexual, but not be part of the trans community, not
[02:56:28.980 --> 02:56:30.060]  be part of a movement.
[02:56:30.060 --> 02:56:34.980]  I think that everything sort of derails when people start seeing themselves through a collective
[02:56:34.980 --> 02:56:36.820]  and using we as a pronoun.
[02:56:36.820 --> 02:56:37.820]  Right.
[02:56:37.820 --> 02:56:38.820]  We should not be a pronoun.
[02:56:38.820 --> 02:56:40.820]  You shouldn't ever be talking for, from or within a group.
[02:56:40.820 --> 02:56:42.199]  Speak for yourself.
[02:56:42.199 --> 02:56:49.860]  And also understand that, you know, there's nothing political about trans other than the
[02:56:49.860 --> 02:56:52.939]  fact that liberals have made it political like they do with every group.
[02:56:53.180 --> 02:56:56.779]  You know, just like they make black political, they make a gay political, they make straight
[02:56:56.779 --> 02:56:58.220]  white men political.
[02:56:58.220 --> 02:57:04.500]  Who we are isn't inherently part of some, you know, like political football or tribe
[02:57:04.500 --> 02:57:05.500]  like that.
[02:57:05.500 --> 02:57:11.660]  Who we are should be like closer to our true selves, which is so much more than all of that.
[02:57:11.660 --> 02:57:13.100]  I agree with you.
[02:57:13.100 --> 02:57:18.699]  When we come back, we'll do 15 more minutes, but 30 seconds left.
[02:57:18.699 --> 02:57:20.220]  How often does your podcast come out?
[02:57:20.220 --> 02:57:22.220]  Oh, I do a podcast once a week.
[02:57:22.220 --> 02:57:23.900]  I also post to my main channel all the time.
[02:57:23.900 --> 02:57:25.380]  I'm pretty active on all my stuff.
[02:57:25.380 --> 02:57:27.580]  And right now I'm working on so many things.
[02:57:27.580 --> 02:57:29.980]  Everyone should go watch the podcast with me and Roseanne.
[02:57:29.980 --> 02:57:30.980]  It's so funny.
[02:57:30.980 --> 02:57:32.180]  I put that on my channel as well.
[02:57:32.180 --> 02:57:33.820]  I haven't seen that yet, but that looks great.
[02:57:33.820 --> 02:57:34.820]  So funny.
[02:57:34.820 --> 02:57:35.820]  When did that happen?
[02:57:35.820 --> 02:57:36.820]  That was a few days ago.
[02:57:36.820 --> 02:57:38.539]  So Blair White, Roseanne Barr, everybody can find it.
[02:57:38.539 --> 02:57:39.539]  Yeah.
[02:57:39.539 --> 02:57:40.539]  On my channel.
[02:57:40.539 --> 02:57:41.539]  YouTube.com slash Blair White X.
[02:57:41.539 --> 02:57:42.539]  All right.
[02:57:42.539 --> 02:57:43.779]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:43.779 --> 02:57:47.660]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[02:57:47.660 --> 02:57:52.220]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through mother nature has given us the
[02:57:52.220 --> 02:57:53.220]  answer.
[02:57:53.220 --> 02:57:57.300]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum CBD oil, the incredible things it
[02:57:57.300 --> 02:58:02.619]  does for your nerves, your brain, now your entire physiological system for your nervous
[02:58:02.619 --> 02:58:04.140]  system particularly.
[02:58:04.140 --> 02:58:05.140]  Everybody knows it's incredible.
[02:58:05.140 --> 02:58:06.140]  It works.
[02:58:06.140 --> 02:58:10.740]  We have the strongest, best CBD oil you're going to find anywhere at the lowest price.
[02:58:10.740 --> 02:58:17.539]  Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for 30% more because that's who we're getting it from.
[02:58:17.539 --> 02:58:20.260]  It's made right here in Central Texas.
[02:58:20.260 --> 02:58:23.900]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[02:58:23.900 --> 02:58:29.500]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.
[02:58:29.500 --> 02:58:32.500]  It's based right here in Texas and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[02:58:32.500 --> 02:58:36.180]  And here's what's even crazier, 30% off of what they're selling it for.
[02:58:36.180 --> 02:58:39.380]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[02:58:39.380 --> 02:58:43.699]  So this is the highest rated, already at the lowest price, now even a lower price.
[02:58:43.699 --> 02:58:44.699]  Rebel Zen.

[02:58:55.500 --> 02:59:00.699]  Concentrated chicken broth, patented amazing, then a huge dose of chaga mushroom, a massive
[02:59:00.699 --> 02:59:06.619]  dose of bee pollen, a gigantic dose of highest quality turmeric, and then it just gets crazier
[02:59:06.619 --> 02:59:07.779]  from there.
[02:59:07.779 --> 02:59:08.939]  It's about to sell out.
[02:59:08.939 --> 02:59:10.460]  We haven't had it in stock for years.
[02:59:10.460 --> 02:59:12.420]  This first new run is about to sell out.

[02:59:39.020 --> 02:59:46.539]  We're selling out ultimate Bone Broth at InfoWareStore.com, 40% off, about to sell out.
[02:59:46.900 --> 02:59:55.900]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:16.900 --> 03:00:30.900]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S. resistance
[03:00:30.900 --> 03:00:34.900]  against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with
[03:00:34.900 --> 03:00:37.900]  the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[03:00:37.900 --> 03:00:42.900]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S. telecommunications infrastructure.
[03:00:42.900 --> 03:00:44.900]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[03:00:44.900 --> 03:00:47.900]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[03:00:47.900 --> 03:00:48.900]  This is all confirmed.
[03:00:48.900 --> 03:00:49.900]  This is not a drill.
[03:00:49.900 --> 03:00:53.900]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[03:00:53.900 --> 03:00:56.900]  They've officially become state-run, Apple 100%.
[03:00:56.900 --> 03:01:01.900]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[03:01:01.900 --> 03:01:06.900]  They are now beta testing, using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones,
[03:01:06.900 --> 03:01:07.900]  to do that.
[03:01:07.900 --> 03:01:08.900]  This is happening.
[03:01:08.900 --> 03:01:12.900]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship,
[03:01:12.900 --> 03:01:15.900]  thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[03:01:15.900 --> 03:01:20.900]  Now, this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all
[03:01:20.900 --> 03:01:21.900]  previous attacks.
[03:01:21.900 --> 03:01:27.900]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome
[03:01:27.900 --> 03:01:30.900]  subversion paradigm manipulation.
[03:01:30.900 --> 03:01:34.900]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[03:01:34.900 --> 03:01:37.900]  We adapt to being oppressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[03:01:38.900 --> 03:01:44.900]  And now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion
[03:01:44.900 --> 03:01:48.900]  instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[03:01:48.900 --> 03:01:53.900]  Total Internet of Things integration, global social score, complete command and control
[03:01:53.900 --> 03:01:54.900]  system.
[03:01:54.900 --> 03:01:59.900]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system now attacking the United States with traitors
[03:01:59.900 --> 03:02:04.900]  inside the major security agencies, blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting
[03:02:04.900 --> 03:02:08.900]  to stop us from removing the tentacles of the Chai Com slash big tech banging combine
[03:02:08.900 --> 03:02:09.900]  emergency situation.
[03:02:09.900 --> 03:02:13.900]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been
[03:02:13.900 --> 03:02:15.900]  battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[03:02:15.900 --> 03:02:21.900]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception
[03:02:21.900 --> 03:02:24.900]  where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[03:02:24.900 --> 03:02:29.900]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw
[03:02:29.900 --> 03:02:30.900]  man.
[03:02:30.900 --> 03:02:33.900]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars.
[03:02:33.900 --> 03:02:35.900]  And so they make me a herder of children.
[03:02:35.900 --> 03:02:39.900]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually
[03:02:39.900 --> 03:02:43.900]  censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[03:02:43.900 --> 03:02:48.900]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them
[03:02:48.900 --> 03:02:50.900]  by being the main distraction.
[03:02:50.900 --> 03:02:55.900]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being
[03:02:55.900 --> 03:02:56.900]  used against you.
[03:02:56.900 --> 03:03:01.900]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[03:03:01.900 --> 03:03:03.900]  I have given you the transmission.
[03:03:03.900 --> 03:03:05.900]  Now break free.
[03:03:07.900 --> 03:03:15.900]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[03:03:15.900 --> 03:03:17.900]  the mind of man.
[03:03:17.900 --> 03:03:19.900]  Thomas Jefferson.
[03:03:19.900 --> 03:03:24.900]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:03:25.900 --> 03:03:31.900]  This will be a day long remembered.
[03:03:31.900 --> 03:03:33.900]  We've seen the end of the Clintons.
[03:03:33.900 --> 03:03:36.900]  We'll soon see the end of the globalists.
[03:03:36.900 --> 03:03:37.900]  Donald J.
[03:03:37.900 --> 03:03:39.900]  Trump is now president of the United States.
[03:03:39.900 --> 03:03:41.900]  It's not true.
[03:03:41.900 --> 03:03:43.900]  That's impossible.
[03:03:43.900 --> 03:03:45.900]  Search your feelings.
[03:03:45.900 --> 03:03:47.900]  You know it to be true.
[03:03:48.900 --> 03:03:50.900]  No.
[03:04:06.900 --> 03:04:09.900]  This is the heart of 1776.
[03:04:09.900 --> 03:04:11.900]  You're a white man.
[03:04:11.900 --> 03:04:16.900]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[03:04:17.900 --> 03:04:18.900]  Move, bitch.
[03:04:18.900 --> 03:04:19.900]  Get out of the way.
[03:04:21.900 --> 03:04:27.900]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[03:04:27.900 --> 03:04:31.900]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[03:04:31.900 --> 03:04:35.900]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[03:04:35.900 --> 03:04:36.900]  I will not let you down.
[03:04:36.900 --> 03:04:41.900]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[03:04:41.900 --> 03:04:43.900]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[03:04:43.900 --> 03:04:44.900]  It's true.
[03:04:44.900 --> 03:04:49.900]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the United States.
[03:04:49.900 --> 03:04:51.900]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:04:51.900 --> 03:04:53.900]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:04:57.900 --> 03:05:04.900]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[03:05:04.900 --> 03:05:09.900]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element,
[03:05:09.900 --> 03:05:13.900]  which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[03:05:13.900 --> 03:05:16.900]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[03:05:16.900 --> 03:05:19.900]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:05:19.900 --> 03:05:24.900]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics
[03:05:24.900 --> 03:05:28.900]  that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[03:05:28.900 --> 03:05:32.900]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day,
[03:05:32.900 --> 03:05:38.900]  derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[03:05:38.900 --> 03:05:44.900]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[03:05:44.900 --> 03:05:50.900]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[03:05:50.900 --> 03:05:57.900]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:05:57.900 --> 03:06:01.900]  Broadcast with a special report from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:06:01.900 --> 03:06:05.900]  If I could, I'd make a deal with God.
[03:06:05.900 --> 03:06:08.900]  I'd let the devil just swallow me.
[03:06:08.900 --> 03:06:13.900]  Attempts have been made to neutralize the Infowarrior known as Alex Jones.
[03:06:13.900 --> 03:06:18.900]  Countless attacks have been witnessed and reported in an effort to bring him down.
[03:06:18.900 --> 03:06:21.900]  If I could, I'd make a deal with God.
[03:06:21.900 --> 03:06:26.900]  Alex Jones has been sighted on the battlefield fighting against the forces of evil.
[03:06:26.900 --> 03:06:29.900]  We're not going to go down and just shut our mouths and just put up with this.
[03:06:29.900 --> 03:06:33.900]  We know where the bodies are buried, folks, and one way or another, we're going to stay on air.
[03:06:35.900 --> 03:06:39.900]  We're receiving reports that Alex Jones has broken through the front lines
[03:06:39.900 --> 03:06:41.900]  and is now heading toward the broadcast studio.
[03:06:41.900 --> 03:06:44.900]  All efforts to silence him have failed.
[03:06:44.900 --> 03:06:48.900]  Emerging victorious against the New World Order, here's your host, Alex Jones.
[03:06:48.900 --> 03:06:52.900]  Find the Infowars transmission at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:06:52.900 --> 03:06:56.900]  If you're receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:06:56.900 --> 03:06:58.900]  And now, Owen Troyer.
[03:06:58.900 --> 03:07:01.900]  Where darkness spreads its tendrils across the universe,
[03:07:01.900 --> 03:07:05.900]  one hero rises against the immeasurable might of the globalists.
[03:07:05.900 --> 03:07:10.900]  Tune in and trust in the power of the people to lead us to victory in the great Infowar.
[03:07:10.900 --> 03:07:14.900]  Prepare for the ultimate battle for truth with today's war room broadcast.
[03:07:14.900 --> 03:07:18.900]  Now, it's your host, Owen Troyer and his intrepid crew.
[03:07:18.900 --> 03:07:23.900]  Find the show and share the links at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:07:27.900 --> 03:07:34.900]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[03:07:34.900 --> 03:07:36.900]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:07:36.900 --> 03:07:38.900]  All right, the great Drew Hernandez is coming up here in about 10 minutes.
[03:07:38.900 --> 03:07:39.900]  We're going to skip this next break.
[03:07:39.900 --> 03:07:43.900]  Owen Troyer comes up in about 53 minutes with the war room.
[03:07:43.900 --> 03:07:48.900]  Blair White is here in studio with us challenging the whole globalist narrative
[03:07:48.900 --> 03:07:50.900]  and the trans-agenda targeting our children.
[03:07:50.900 --> 03:07:53.900]  We've got 10 minutes left until Drew Hernandez takes over.
[03:07:53.900 --> 03:07:54.900]  We're skipping the break so he has more time.
[03:07:54.900 --> 03:07:56.900]  We'll skip the last network break, too, so he gets all his time back.
[03:07:56.900 --> 03:07:57.900]  Always love.
[03:07:57.900 --> 03:07:58.900]  Thank you, Drew Hernandez.
[03:07:58.900 --> 03:08:04.900]  But you wanted to get into DeSantis, Trump, the election, not just obsessed on the trans issues.
[03:08:04.900 --> 03:08:05.900]  So you got the floor, Blair.
[03:08:05.900 --> 03:08:06.900]  Take it away.
[03:08:06.900 --> 03:08:09.900]  Well, we can talk about anything, but I was just thinking it's interesting how for a minute
[03:08:09.900 --> 03:08:14.900]  I felt like I was gravitating towards DeSantis because of how we handled the pandemic versus Trump,
[03:08:14.900 --> 03:08:18.900]  which is, you know, Trump is the king of the vaccine in many ways.
[03:08:18.900 --> 03:08:23.900]  But now I feel like the energy for me is shifting back towards Trump.
[03:08:23.900 --> 03:08:24.900]  I wanted to see how you felt about that.
[03:08:24.900 --> 03:08:27.900]  Like, are you what's like the way forward?
[03:08:27.900 --> 03:08:28.900]  Is it Trump?
[03:08:28.900 --> 03:08:31.900]  When DeSantis was being himself, he was doing a great job.
[03:08:31.900 --> 03:08:37.900]  As soon as he got Jeb Bush and Karl Rove on his team, it was like he was a deflated balloon.
[03:08:37.900 --> 03:08:38.900]  Yeah.
[03:08:38.900 --> 03:08:42.900]  And he really proved people right when they were saying that he was the establishment choice
[03:08:42.900 --> 03:08:46.900]  and he was this and that, because I didn't even necessarily believe that at first.
[03:08:46.900 --> 03:08:49.900]  I was like, how could he be establishment based on the way he handled the pandemic?
[03:08:49.900 --> 03:08:50.900]  Because at a certain.
[03:08:50.900 --> 03:08:53.900]  No, he wasn't established until he joined them to try to win.
[03:08:53.900 --> 03:08:54.900]  Right.
[03:08:54.900 --> 03:08:55.900]  Right.
[03:08:55.900 --> 03:08:56.900]  They lied to him and said an indicted Trump.
[03:08:56.900 --> 03:08:57.900]  He can beat that.
[03:08:57.900 --> 03:09:00.900]  I mean, it's a five year old could tell him that it's politically savvy.
[03:09:00.900 --> 03:09:01.900]  Right.
[03:09:01.900 --> 03:09:04.900]  And if he hadn't made that choice, you know, I think he'd be in a much better position
[03:09:04.900 --> 03:09:08.900]  because at the end of the day, there was a point in time where I think the only free
[03:09:08.900 --> 03:09:13.900]  place on the planet, including some third world countries that was open during the lockdown
[03:09:13.900 --> 03:09:14.900]  was literally Florida.
[03:09:14.900 --> 03:09:15.900]  You know, it's like the entire.
[03:09:15.900 --> 03:09:18.900]  It's a shame to watch himself emulate.
[03:09:18.900 --> 03:09:19.900]  Yeah, it really is.
[03:09:19.900 --> 03:09:24.900]  And, you know, Trump's not perfect, but there's just nothing for me like the Trump energy
[03:09:24.900 --> 03:09:26.900]  and the way he energizes like his side.
[03:09:26.900 --> 03:09:27.900]  It's like.
[03:09:27.900 --> 03:09:29.900]  Well, the whole power structure for indictments.
[03:09:29.900 --> 03:09:32.900]  You know, I mean, is the Georgia indictments imminent?
[03:09:32.900 --> 03:09:33.900]  This is ridiculous.
[03:09:33.900 --> 03:09:34.900]  But even that's scary.
[03:09:34.900 --> 03:09:37.900]  I don't want to live in a country where you have, you know, presidential candidates getting
[03:09:37.900 --> 03:09:40.900]  each other arrested and shit like that's scary.
[03:09:40.900 --> 03:09:41.900]  I agree.
[03:09:41.900 --> 03:09:43.900]  So you say a lot of your podcasts.
[03:09:43.900 --> 03:09:44.900]  I can ask questions all day.
[03:09:44.900 --> 03:09:46.900]  But what else do you want to impart to the viewers and listeners?
[03:09:46.900 --> 03:09:52.900]  How do you see there's a backlash now against the leftist dehumanization, target the children
[03:09:52.900 --> 03:09:55.900]  pedophilic, think piggybacks on the trans agenda.
[03:09:55.900 --> 03:09:57.900]  How do you see this unfolding?
[03:09:57.900 --> 03:10:02.900]  I mean, I would say just kind of place the backlash where it's deserved.
[03:10:02.900 --> 03:10:03.900]  Right.
[03:10:03.900 --> 03:10:06.900]  It's like, you know, there's people responsible for certain things and then there's not.
[03:10:06.900 --> 03:10:07.900]  And then there's useful idiots.
[03:10:07.900 --> 03:10:09.900]  And then there's people being co-opted.
[03:10:09.900 --> 03:10:10.900]  That would be me.
[03:10:10.900 --> 03:10:13.900]  You know, so it's like just place it where it's deserved.
[03:10:13.900 --> 03:10:16.900]  Criticize what's worth criticizing, you know.
[03:10:16.900 --> 03:10:23.900]  And also, I think the argument can get weakened when people fight against children transitioning
[03:10:23.900 --> 03:10:29.900]  by also like throwing adult freedom and adult autonomy, bodily autonomy in with that, like
[03:10:29.900 --> 03:10:30.900]  out with the water.
[03:10:30.900 --> 03:10:31.900]  Right.
[03:10:31.900 --> 03:10:34.900]  It weakens it because it's then people just fight against all of it.
[03:10:34.900 --> 03:10:37.900]  Well, it's how they lie and say conservatives are banning books.
[03:10:37.900 --> 03:10:40.900]  No, the left's banning books and free speech everywhere.
[03:10:40.900 --> 03:10:45.900]  On record, we're trying to ban eight year olds being given horrible pornographic books.
[03:10:45.900 --> 03:10:46.900]  Right.
[03:10:46.900 --> 03:10:47.900]  But this is how they lie.
[03:10:47.900 --> 03:10:52.900]  Because in Tennessee, there was a story was, oh, drag is being banned.
[03:10:52.900 --> 03:10:54.900]  You know, people were DMing me and commenting.
[03:10:54.900 --> 03:10:57.900]  All my comments were like, when are you going to talk about Tennessee banning drag?
[03:10:57.900 --> 03:10:59.900]  And I'm like, let me see.
[03:10:59.900 --> 03:11:00.900]  So I look it up.
[03:11:00.900 --> 03:11:01.900]  And of course, it's not banning drag at all.
[03:11:01.900 --> 03:11:03.900]  It's keeping it in over 18 clubs.
[03:11:03.900 --> 03:11:08.900]  But that's the way the lie, because it keeps that community of people living in this state
[03:11:08.900 --> 03:11:11.900]  of perpetual fear that the world is coming down on them.
[03:11:11.900 --> 03:11:15.900]  When in reality, I don't think there's any rational, you know, way to think that.
[03:11:15.900 --> 03:11:16.900]  I agree.
[03:11:16.900 --> 03:11:20.900]  Let's pull up the haunted face of the woman that transitioned to man.
[03:11:20.900 --> 03:11:23.900]  Well, she looks like a demonic clown.
[03:11:23.900 --> 03:11:27.900]  And now they're suppressing the manifesto that we've got parts of that was that was
[03:11:27.900 --> 03:11:31.900]  anti-Christian and going and targeting a church, a school full of children.
[03:11:31.900 --> 03:11:33.900]  That was a Christian hate crime.
[03:11:33.900 --> 03:11:34.900]  And no one talks about that.
[03:11:34.900 --> 03:11:35.900]  Talk about it.
[03:11:35.900 --> 03:11:39.900]  If that was any other group of people that got shot up like that, any other school, not
[03:11:39.900 --> 03:11:43.900]  even people, it was children, children, people, you know what I mean?
[03:11:43.900 --> 03:11:46.900]  Any other group, it would be called a hate crime against them.
[03:11:46.900 --> 03:11:47.900]  Right.
[03:11:47.900 --> 03:11:49.900]  If it was a mosque, it would be an anti-Muslim hate crime.
[03:11:49.900 --> 03:11:52.900]  If it was a synagogue, you know, name any group.
[03:11:52.900 --> 03:11:53.900]  Right.
[03:11:53.900 --> 03:11:59.900]  So I just don't like even that the sort of like minimization of that, because that's
[03:11:59.900 --> 03:12:00.900]  what it was at the end of the day.
[03:12:00.900 --> 03:12:01.900]  That was the first thing I thought.
[03:12:01.900 --> 03:12:02.900]  You can put the word trans in there.
[03:12:02.900 --> 03:12:03.900]  You can put it.
[03:12:03.900 --> 03:12:04.900]  I'm like, this was a Christian hate crime.
[03:12:04.900 --> 03:12:08.900]  This was, you know, a girl who clearly was unwell, but she had resentment and hatred
[03:12:08.900 --> 03:12:09.900]  towards Christians.
[03:12:09.900 --> 03:12:11.900]  Can we put up the Tennessee shooter?
[03:12:11.900 --> 03:12:16.900]  It's that haunting photo where she looks like a total clown and she looks so haunted
[03:12:16.900 --> 03:12:17.900]  while she's killing these kids.
[03:12:17.900 --> 03:12:18.900]  Yeah.
[03:12:18.900 --> 03:12:19.900]  Yeah.
[03:12:19.900 --> 03:12:20.900]  And so scary.
[03:12:20.900 --> 03:12:21.900]  Right.
[03:12:21.900 --> 03:12:24.900]  And not to make a no true Scotsman fallacy here.
[03:12:24.900 --> 03:12:30.900]  But when I look at her, I'm like, so what exactly makes this person trans?
[03:12:30.900 --> 03:12:32.900]  Because now they make that definition.
[03:12:32.900 --> 03:12:33.900]  So look at that face.
[03:12:33.900 --> 03:12:35.900]  Literally the devil.
[03:12:35.900 --> 03:12:39.900]  I watched the video of her getting taken out and like the pictures a few times because
[03:12:39.900 --> 03:12:40.900]  I was like, thank God.
[03:12:40.900 --> 03:12:43.900]  But but I look at that person and I'm like.
[03:12:43.900 --> 03:12:47.900]  I get that they say that they're trans, but having pronouns in your bio doesn't really
[03:12:47.900 --> 03:12:48.900]  make you trans.
[03:12:48.900 --> 03:12:50.900]  Well, what are the psychiatrists do to this poor woman?
[03:12:50.900 --> 03:12:51.900]  I mean, look at this.
[03:12:51.900 --> 03:12:55.900]  Yeah, but look, a beautiful young lady turns into this.
[03:12:55.900 --> 03:12:56.900]  Right.
[03:12:56.900 --> 03:12:58.900]  And there's clearly like shooting six year olds.
[03:12:58.900 --> 03:12:59.900]  Right.
[03:12:59.900 --> 03:13:00.900]  Right.
[03:13:00.900 --> 03:13:01.900]  Right.
[03:13:01.900 --> 03:13:02.900]  Right.
[03:13:02.900 --> 03:13:03.900]  Right.
[03:13:03.900 --> 03:13:04.900]  And have they released like what drugs she was on at all?
[03:13:04.900 --> 03:13:05.900]  Because, you know, they admit she was on a bunch of drugs.
[03:13:05.900 --> 03:13:06.900]  What were they about?
[03:13:06.900 --> 03:13:07.900]  Like psychotics?
[03:13:07.900 --> 03:13:08.900]  They said it was.
[03:13:08.900 --> 03:13:09.900]  Yeah, it was.
[03:13:09.900 --> 03:13:13.900]  It was antidepressants, which on the drug says can make you do psychotic stuff.
[03:13:13.900 --> 03:13:14.900]  Right.
[03:13:14.900 --> 03:13:16.900]  It's like people don't understand.
[03:13:16.900 --> 03:13:21.420]  I've never met someone who takes no offense to anyone who takes antidepressants and makes
[03:13:21.420 --> 03:13:22.420]  that choice.
[03:13:22.420 --> 03:13:23.420]  And maybe it's good for them.
[03:13:23.420 --> 03:13:24.820]  Like I said, what's good for you is good for you.
[03:13:24.820 --> 03:13:25.820]  Me for me.
[03:13:25.820 --> 03:13:30.580]  I've never met anyone who from the outside looking in seems to benefit from antidepressants.
[03:13:30.580 --> 03:13:32.060]  I've been very honest about my life.
[03:13:32.060 --> 03:13:33.340]  I've drank way too much.
[03:13:33.340 --> 03:13:35.380]  I love tobacco.
[03:13:35.380 --> 03:13:37.539]  And I've taken hallucinogens a few times.
[03:13:37.539 --> 03:13:39.740]  I tried cocaine a couple of times.
[03:13:39.740 --> 03:13:43.760]  Methamphetamine made me so sick in high school and college, never did it again.
[03:13:43.760 --> 03:13:48.060]  But I had a girlfriend in college that took Prozac.
[03:13:48.060 --> 03:13:50.060]  So I thought, let me see what this feels like.
[03:13:50.060 --> 03:13:51.619]  They claim it has to build up.
[03:13:51.619 --> 03:13:54.740]  I took one Prozac pill one day, another a few days.
[03:13:54.740 --> 03:13:59.060]  I was in a dream that week when I took Prozac for one week.
[03:13:59.060 --> 03:14:01.100]  I was like, didn't even remember it.
[03:14:01.100 --> 03:14:02.100]  Yeah.
[03:14:02.100 --> 03:14:04.939]  Like, I mean, they say it doesn't even kick in for a month.
[03:14:04.939 --> 03:14:06.699]  What must that be like?
[03:14:06.699 --> 03:14:07.699]  100 percent.
[03:14:07.699 --> 03:14:12.100]  And also a lot of, you know, I was on just to be very transparent, I was on a little
[03:14:12.100 --> 03:14:15.580]  bit of an Adderall kick a while ago where, you know, I was maybe taking Adderall for
[03:14:15.580 --> 03:14:17.439]  a week or two to get a lot of work done.
[03:14:17.439 --> 03:14:21.020]  And I couldn't believe it was my first time taking it and I couldn't believe what it was
[03:14:21.020 --> 03:14:22.020]  doing.
[03:14:22.020 --> 03:14:23.020]  I felt like I was on crack.
[03:14:23.020 --> 03:14:24.500]  And I think about like they're putting kids on it.
[03:14:25.260 --> 03:14:31.980]  Little kids who are exhibiting normal behavior of children, which is then diagnosed as something.
[03:14:31.980 --> 03:14:33.580]  And they're on speed for it.
[03:14:33.580 --> 03:14:34.580]  It's insane.
[03:14:34.580 --> 03:14:39.140]  So it doesn't shock me at all that, you know, these shooters, the one thing they all seem
[03:14:39.140 --> 03:14:41.820]  to have in common are these drugs and what they do.
[03:14:41.820 --> 03:14:46.860]  I mean, they say it to your face in the commercials, the long list of like taking this drug to not
[03:14:46.860 --> 03:14:48.980]  kill yourself might make you kill yourself.
[03:14:48.980 --> 03:14:50.340]  It's like, then why take it?
[03:14:50.340 --> 03:14:51.340]  It doesn't make sense to me.
[03:14:51.340 --> 03:14:52.900]  Well, we got about 60 seconds left.
[03:14:52.900 --> 03:14:53.900]  We're going to skip this break.
[03:14:53.900 --> 03:14:54.900]  We're going to take over.
[03:14:54.900 --> 03:14:55.900]  We're white.
[03:14:55.900 --> 03:14:56.900]  Thanks for coming in.
[03:14:56.900 --> 03:15:00.900]  I'd love to come back on your show back when I was censored years ago, you were the first
[03:15:00.900 --> 03:15:01.900]  host to have me on.
[03:15:01.900 --> 03:15:02.900]  I appreciate that.
[03:15:02.900 --> 03:15:04.900]  Any other things you'd like to add?
[03:15:04.900 --> 03:15:08.500]  No, I just, you know, I'm very thankful to be here.
[03:15:08.500 --> 03:15:09.820]  You know, it's been a long time coming.
[03:15:09.820 --> 03:15:11.820]  Obviously, we did a remote one like eight years ago.
[03:15:11.820 --> 03:15:15.060]  So it's just cool to be here and we'll do more stuff in the future.
[03:15:15.060 --> 03:15:17.420]  And thanks to everyone for hanging out.
[03:15:17.420 --> 03:15:20.320]  What are you doing next on your podcast?
[03:15:20.320 --> 03:15:21.320]  Just running my mouth.
[03:15:21.320 --> 03:15:22.320]  All right.
[03:15:22.320 --> 03:15:23.320]  Well, don't run off.
[03:15:23.740 --> 03:15:24.740]  I'm going to introduce Drew Hernandez.
[03:15:24.740 --> 03:15:26.740]  I'm going to say bye to you and your crew.
[03:15:26.740 --> 03:15:29.740]  And then Owen's coming up in about 45 minutes.
[03:15:29.740 --> 03:15:30.740]  Exactly.
[03:15:30.740 --> 03:15:31.740]  Owen Shroyer.
[03:15:31.740 --> 03:15:32.740]  Blair White.

[03:15:41.920 --> 03:15:42.920]  Thank you so much, Blair.

[03:15:49.500 --> 03:15:53.520]  We'd have an open discussion about who represents who and not let the left misrepresent who
[03:15:53.520 --> 03:15:55.279]  they control and what's going on.
[03:15:55.279 --> 03:16:00.000]  That's what Christ would want is for all of us to be open and have a discussion.

[03:17:06.199 --> 03:17:11.080]  Here you are on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show, the most banned transmission in
[03:17:11.080 --> 03:17:12.160]  the universe.
[03:17:12.160 --> 03:17:16.279]  My name is Drew Hernandez, your guest host for the remainder of the fourth hour before
[03:17:16.279 --> 03:17:22.240]  the legendary Owen Schroyer, the Cook destroyer, shows up on the infamous, according to who
[03:17:22.240 --> 03:17:24.160]  you ask, or the famous war room.
[03:17:24.160 --> 03:17:30.840]  But guys, let's like really ask the fundamental question that Pontius Pilate was asking himself
[03:17:30.840 --> 03:17:33.439]  when he was on the verge of crucifying Jesus Christ.
[03:17:33.439 --> 03:17:38.400]  And it's a very fundamental question that we see fact checkers attempting to dictate,
[03:17:38.400 --> 03:17:43.640]  that we see authoritarian regimes attempt to dictate not only here in the United States
[03:17:43.640 --> 03:17:50.080]  of America, deep state, global cabal, CCP, and their authoritarian digitized state of
[03:17:50.080 --> 03:17:54.279]  all their surveillance state, big brother, always monitoring everything, whether it's
[03:17:54.279 --> 03:18:01.240]  in the 20th century, the 21st century, the 19th, 18th, human history dealing with authoritarianism.
[03:18:01.240 --> 03:18:06.800]  It's always fundamentally based on one thing, and that is the question of what is truth.
[03:18:06.800 --> 03:18:11.080]  And people have to ask themselves this question not only every single day, but when you get
[03:18:11.080 --> 03:18:16.800]  into a realm in your life where you start to really open up your mind to what happens
[03:18:16.800 --> 03:18:24.900]  when we die, what happens when this is all over, what happens in the future, what happens
[03:18:24.900 --> 03:18:29.920]  to my family, what are the consequences to certain actions, not only in society, but
[03:18:29.920 --> 03:18:32.000]  in a family unit.
[03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:37.080]  Every single one of these questions surrounds or thoughts surrounds around the question
[03:18:37.080 --> 03:18:40.000]  of what is truth.
[03:18:40.100 --> 03:18:47.460]  We know truth is the ultimate defining reality of what the fact of the matter literally is
[03:18:47.460 --> 03:18:52.320]  whether you're dealing with religion, whether you're dealing with God, whether you're
[03:18:52.320 --> 03:18:57.400]  dealing with politics, whether you're dealing with a situation, whether you're dealing
[03:18:57.400 --> 03:19:02.460]  with media, whether you're dealing with gender, sex, whether you're dealing with
[03:19:02.460 --> 03:19:05.460]  biological realities, it doesn't matter.
[03:19:05.460 --> 03:19:10.980]  whatever you're dealing with, you have to always fundamentally ask yourself, what is the fact of
[03:19:10.980 --> 03:19:16.500]  the matter here? Now, the big question here in the debate that everyone has been having, I mean,
[03:19:16.500 --> 03:19:20.500]  that everyone has been having in human history for thousands of years is, well, who gets to
[03:19:20.500 --> 03:19:27.699]  determine what is true? Is it the state? Is it Big Brother? Is it the media? More recently,
[03:19:28.260 --> 03:19:35.060]  is it Big Tech and the fact checkers? Is it Joe Biden? Is it Kamala Harris? Is it Donald J. Trump?
[03:19:35.619 --> 03:19:41.300]  Is it Infowars? Is it Alex Jones? Is it Drew Hernandez? Is it your favorite commentator,
[03:19:41.300 --> 03:19:48.340]  whether left or right? What is truth? Who gets to determine what is true? Who gets to determine what
[03:19:48.340 --> 03:19:55.779]  is righteous? Who gets to determine ultimately what is objectively 100% accurate when it comes
[03:19:55.779 --> 03:20:02.820]  to a perfect, perfect bullseye determining the truth? Now, this is why people strive to
[03:20:03.619 --> 03:20:10.260]  land on the target and land on the bullseye of absolute 100% fact. And we know that those that
[03:20:10.260 --> 03:20:16.580]  are seeking to determine those facts, that are vetting those facts to communicate those facts,
[03:20:16.580 --> 03:20:22.420]  those are the ones that either get A, extremely demonized and slandered and discredited.
[03:20:22.420 --> 03:20:27.779]  And you see this on a daily basis. Anyone that's honestly a truth speaker that finds the fact of
[03:20:28.500 --> 03:20:35.860]  the matter that they're talking about gets absolutely obliterated, destroyed, discredited.
[03:20:35.860 --> 03:20:40.980]  They will not be and they shall not be listened to because that is how an individual gets jacked
[03:20:40.980 --> 03:20:47.460]  outside of the matrix. But the other response is an individual will be greatly respected.
[03:20:47.460 --> 03:20:53.539]  An individual will be seen as someone that is a trusted source of information that does vet their
[03:20:53.539 --> 03:20:59.460]  own information, that is willing not only to seek the truth but communicate the truth at the cost of
[03:20:59.460 --> 03:21:05.380]  getting destroyed and obliterated. You get respected for such an act like that. And especially
[03:21:05.380 --> 03:21:12.180]  if you're a part of this movement where people are truly awakening to this truth of reality,
[03:21:12.180 --> 03:21:19.060]  of God, of the universe, the multi-dimensional world that we live in. It's one of two. It's one
[03:21:19.060 --> 03:21:24.580]  of two. You're either going to get demonized or you're going to get well-respected by an individual.
[03:21:24.580 --> 03:21:31.779]  But a truth speaker, a truth seeker gets hit with both. But ultimately we don't worship man,
[03:21:31.779 --> 03:21:39.380]  we don't serve a human being. We're not trying to please human beings because man is a snare
[03:21:39.380 --> 03:21:44.100]  according to the Bible. Now what does that mean when Pachis Pilate, when you know a Roman
[03:21:44.900 --> 03:21:49.619]  you know a Roman captain and leader at the time was faced with the question
[03:21:49.619 --> 03:21:55.060]  you know what is truth when Jesus checked him this guy was hit right in between the eyes
[03:21:55.060 --> 03:22:00.100]  could not even answer it within himself what what is true especially in this situation
[03:22:01.060 --> 03:22:05.939]  because we have an innocent man here that has no crimes according to Rome but Rome viewed Jesus
[03:22:05.939 --> 03:22:11.939]  Christ as a threat to the state the ultimate insurrectionist because he was riling up the Jews
[03:22:11.939 --> 03:22:18.660]  he was a revolutionary Jew that was causing an uproar not only in Jerusalem and Galilee and all
[03:22:18.660 --> 03:22:25.300]  of the spots that Jesus did his human ministry but also the Jews the religious zealots of the day
[03:22:25.300 --> 03:22:31.060]  the Pharisees and the Sadducees were pushing for the execution of Jesus Christ the Messiah
[03:22:32.500 --> 03:22:36.580]  so when Pachis Pilate was put in this position he was ultimately presented with
[03:22:36.580 --> 03:22:43.140]  the fundamental question that we all ask ourselves every single day what is truth now when you peel
[03:22:43.140 --> 03:22:49.619]  that back theologically speaking the same one that prompted that question in the mind of Pachis Pilate
[03:22:49.619 --> 03:22:56.260]  in such a serious time in his life about to crucify an innocent man and murder an innocent
[03:22:56.260 --> 03:23:02.740]  man publicly he ultimately caved and this was all according to the will of God he ultimately caved
[03:23:03.300 --> 03:23:09.779]  to the fear of men to the religious Sadducees the radicalized Jews of the day that were pushing
[03:23:09.779 --> 03:23:14.820]  for the crucifixion and execution of an innocent man that's the gospel message okay that's all
[03:23:14.820 --> 03:23:20.100]  according to God's will he was offered up as the innocent lamb of God for the sacrifice and
[03:23:20.100 --> 03:23:25.619]  the forgiveness of sins for all of mankind for eternity but it's based on whether you receive
[03:23:25.619 --> 03:23:31.220]  that free gift or not it's by faith alone grace not of works lest any man shall boast
[03:23:32.180 --> 03:23:37.619]  but when that fundamental question when your reality gets breached like when Pachis Pilate
[03:23:37.619 --> 03:23:42.980]  his reality was breached in that moment maybe never even thought about that ever in his lifetime
[03:23:42.980 --> 03:23:49.619]  what is truth it's a Christ pill moment it's a red pill moment it's a God pill moment it's the
[03:23:49.619 --> 03:23:56.180]  ultimate moment where truth does breach the mind you will not be red pills if you are not dealing
[03:23:56.420 --> 03:24:01.300]  in truth you will not be Christ filled if you are not fundamentally dealing in truth
[03:24:02.260 --> 03:24:10.260]  you can't dance around it you can't thwart it you can't debate it you cannot debate the truth and
[03:24:10.260 --> 03:24:18.100]  win because if you do ultimately you will have to result to lies slander and anything but the truth
[03:24:18.100 --> 03:24:23.939]  in order to give an illusion that what you're saying is the truth but if the ultimate fact of
[03:24:23.939 --> 03:24:30.020]  the matter is something opposite of what you're saying then you my friend are a liar and a
[03:24:30.020 --> 03:24:35.060]  deceiver and that's not where we want to be we want to be on the side of Christ ultimately every
[03:24:35.060 --> 03:24:43.860]  single day in every single situation every single ideology has to be filtered and has to stand up
[03:24:43.860 --> 03:24:48.100]  against the Bible if you are a self-proclaimed Christian this is the reality of your existence
[03:24:48.100 --> 03:24:55.060]  you are a truth bearer you are an agent of truth and agent of Christ you are an individual that
[03:24:55.060 --> 03:25:00.420]  must deal with truth every single day of your life now the reason why this is important to
[03:25:00.420 --> 03:25:07.220]  understand is because well Jesus Christ comes along and says I am the way the truth and the life
[03:25:08.740 --> 03:25:12.420]  Jesus Christ comes along and says and no man comes to the father except through me
[03:25:13.380 --> 03:25:20.740]  Jesus Christ comes along and claims to be ultimately exclusively the truth of mankind
[03:25:20.740 --> 03:25:29.779]  fundamentally Jesus Christ comes along and says I am the fact of the matter of the universe I am
[03:25:29.779 --> 03:25:38.100]  the one the architect I am the alpha and the omega I am the beginning and the end I am eternal life
[03:25:38.660 --> 03:25:51.220]  I am the bread of life I am the eternal water of life I am Christ is the origin God is life Christ
[03:25:51.220 --> 03:26:00.100]  is life who ultimately understands and holds the future God Christ eschatology who ultimately
[03:26:00.100 --> 03:26:09.300]  understands the past perfectly God Christ he is the author of mankind his will will ultimately
[03:26:09.300 --> 03:26:16.100]  always win in the end no matter what humans say no matter what humans think God will always be
[03:26:16.100 --> 03:26:20.900]  right and listen I'm going to be honest if God before us who could be against us
[03:26:21.619 --> 03:26:28.260]  but the way that I view that is I don't expect God to be on my side because I'm not perfect
[03:26:28.900 --> 03:26:34.980]  I don't get it down right all the time that's why I have to ask him for help that's why I have to
[03:26:34.980 --> 03:26:43.539]  take my ridiculous weak mind and bring it to him the truth so I make sure I'm on his side okay
[03:26:44.100 --> 03:26:52.340]  I'm on his side all right I'm weak I'm powerless I'm nothing without Christ I have nothing literally
[03:26:52.340 --> 03:26:53.140]  nothing
[03:26:53.100 --> 03:26:57.260]  I want to be on his side every single day.
[03:26:57.260 --> 03:27:01.240]  So when you're talking about truth, who is the truth?
[03:27:01.240 --> 03:27:06.220]  If Christ is the truth, that means his word is what the Bible says is truth.
[03:27:06.220 --> 03:27:07.220]  His word is true.
[03:27:07.220 --> 03:27:14.020]  It's a lamp to your feet, the guidance, the path here in this human experience that we
[03:27:14.020 --> 03:27:19.900]  have not only in life temporarily, but in life eternally, who's got the blueprints,
[03:27:19.900 --> 03:27:22.420]  who's got the blueprints for the universe?
[03:27:22.420 --> 03:27:26.820]  Who's got the blueprints for the multidimensional universe that we all know exists?
[03:27:26.820 --> 03:27:28.020]  Because you can interface with it.
[03:27:28.020 --> 03:27:33.220]  I don't recommend you do because you start dealing with demonic activity and powers.
[03:27:33.220 --> 03:27:36.700]  And if you're not a born again Christian, you will not shake them.
[03:27:36.700 --> 03:27:37.700]  You will be tormented.
[03:27:37.700 --> 03:27:39.820]  You will be tormented.
[03:27:39.820 --> 03:27:43.900]  A lot of people wake up to this reality when they start dabbling with the occult and witchcraft
[03:27:43.900 --> 03:27:50.600]  and mediums and interfacing with spirits that claim to be their grandpa from World War Two.
[03:27:50.600 --> 03:27:54.560]  They're all demonic beings that have been around longer than you and I have been alive.
[03:27:54.560 --> 03:27:58.160]  These demonic powers, Lucifer, they have perfect theology.
[03:27:58.160 --> 03:28:00.680]  You say, Drew, whoa, what does that mean?
[03:28:00.680 --> 03:28:06.280]  Oh, these beings have been in the presence of God in eternity before mankind was even
[03:28:06.280 --> 03:28:07.440]  established.
[03:28:07.440 --> 03:28:09.360]  They know who God is.
[03:28:09.360 --> 03:28:13.800]  That's why they are masters at manipulating the truth.
[03:28:13.800 --> 03:28:15.240]  God is truth.
[03:28:15.240 --> 03:28:16.880]  God is life.
[03:28:16.880 --> 03:28:18.440]  Christ is truth.
[03:28:18.440 --> 03:28:19.480]  Christ is life.
[03:28:19.480 --> 03:28:21.520]  What is the reality?
[03:28:21.520 --> 03:28:23.260]  Who is reality?
[03:28:23.260 --> 03:28:24.920]  Who made a reality?
[03:28:24.920 --> 03:28:29.100]  These are fundamental questions that the Bible reveals to every single one of us.
[03:28:29.100 --> 03:28:31.000]  And of course, there will be a pushback.
[03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:32.920]  And of course, there will be a rebellion.
[03:28:32.920 --> 03:28:36.560]  And of course, there will be, well, that's just all mythological.
[03:28:36.560 --> 03:28:37.560]  Is it?
[03:28:37.560 --> 03:28:40.480]  Then why has this existed for so long?
[03:28:40.480 --> 03:28:44.600]  Then why have some of the most prominent men in human history that were confronted by the
[03:28:44.600 --> 03:28:50.560]  historical figure of Christ been confronted with this fundamental question?
[03:28:50.560 --> 03:28:51.560]  What is truth?
[03:28:51.560 --> 03:28:57.160]  And so Jesus Christ.
[03:28:57.160 --> 03:29:05.600]  When hope and love has been lost and you fall to the ground, you must find a way.
[03:29:05.600 --> 03:29:12.720]  When the darkness descends and you're told it's the end, you must find a way.
[03:29:12.840 --> 03:29:18.800]  When God decides to look the other way and a clown takes the throne, we must find a way.
[03:29:18.800 --> 03:29:21.120]  You will find a way.
[03:29:21.120 --> 03:29:24.800]  Dig down and find faith.
[03:29:24.800 --> 03:29:31.840]  When you're close to the edge with a gun to your head, you must find a way.
[03:29:31.840 --> 03:29:34.840]  We have entered the fray and we will not obey.
[03:29:34.840 --> 03:29:39.840]  We must find a way and find faith.
[03:29:39.960 --> 03:29:45.960]  We won't let them divide.
[03:29:45.960 --> 03:29:48.960]  We will never abide.
[03:29:48.960 --> 03:29:51.960]  We will find a way.

[03:32:01.240 --> 03:32:02.240]  answer.

[03:32:58.440 --> 03:33:04.520]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:06.000 --> 03:33:19.600]  The Bible will always be right in the end.
[03:33:19.600 --> 03:33:23.000]  God will always be correct in the end.
[03:33:23.000 --> 03:33:27.220]  You're dealing with the New World Order, you're dealing with the Antichrist, you're dealing
[03:33:27.220 --> 03:33:34.320]  with the satanic, anti-human agenda that is an attack on God.
[03:33:34.320 --> 03:33:42.000]  Those made in God's image, biological males, biological females, getting twisted, perverted,
[03:33:42.000 --> 03:33:45.020]  distorted, it's an ultimate attack on God.
[03:33:45.020 --> 03:33:50.720]  You read Psalms chapter 2, the fallen world, those that are not born again, are not at
[03:33:50.720 --> 03:33:56.440]  war with Trump, they're not at war with America, they're not at war, well fundamentally yes
[03:33:56.440 --> 03:34:06.920]  they are, but ultimately, not with patriotism, their war is ultimately against Messiah, Jesus
[03:34:06.920 --> 03:34:11.240]  Christ the Son of God, because the ultimate showdown in the end, when the New World Order
[03:34:11.240 --> 03:34:18.080]  is fully installed, when the Antichrist rises and is installed, which the Bible says he
[03:34:18.080 --> 03:34:25.540]  will enter into the third Jewish temple in Israel, the state of Israel, right now the
[03:34:25.540 --> 03:34:30.860]  temple mount is empty when it comes to a Jewish temple.
[03:34:30.860 --> 03:34:37.580]  You got the temple mount up there, the Muslims have their religious site, but there is no
[03:34:37.580 --> 03:34:44.220]  third Jewish temple, there is no third Israeli temple, which they are pushing for.
[03:34:44.220 --> 03:34:47.940]  You will watch the Antichrist according to the Bible, he will deceive the Jews, he will
[03:34:47.940 --> 03:34:54.900]  deceive the state of Israel, they will receive him as Messiah, and they will not even understand
[03:34:54.900 --> 03:34:59.220]  and realize that they are accepting Satan with open arms.
[03:34:59.220 --> 03:35:05.500]  But why that's fundamentally imperative to understand is that when this New World Order
[03:35:05.500 --> 03:35:14.180]  is installed, this anti-human agenda is installed, it will be the epicenter in the Middle East,
[03:35:14.180 --> 03:35:19.580]  it will be predominantly in Jerusalem, Old City, Jerusalem, the Bible targets this very
[03:35:19.580 --> 03:35:20.580]  specifically.
[03:35:21.100 --> 03:35:27.460]  He will go into the third Jewish temple that will be built again, because in human history
[03:35:27.460 --> 03:35:34.540]  you only see two, there will be a third one that will be erected, that will be established,
[03:35:34.540 --> 03:35:41.740]  the Antichrist will ultimately walk into it, he will sit in the Holy of Holies and declare
[03:35:41.740 --> 03:35:46.620]  himself to be God, and at that point the Jews will realize that they've been deceived and
[03:35:46.620 --> 03:35:51.580]  they've made a huge mistake, because salvation will come to the House of Israel and to the
[03:35:51.580 --> 03:35:57.780]  tribes, the 12 tribes, and God will save them in a remnant.
[03:35:57.780 --> 03:36:01.740]  But that deception and that level of deception and the installation of the New World Order
[03:36:01.740 --> 03:36:08.460]  where you see this fall of humanity and you see this fall, it comes alongside of it, yes
[03:36:08.460 --> 03:36:15.220]  you see the mark of the beast, you see this mark in the right hand and in the forehead,
[03:36:15.220 --> 03:36:19.900]  you will not be able to access the economy, the cashless society, not only in one region
[03:36:19.900 --> 03:36:23.060]  of the world, this will be worldwide enforced.
[03:36:23.060 --> 03:36:27.460]  But alongside you will see, the Bible does say, especially particularly in the times
[03:36:27.460 --> 03:36:30.980]  of the Antichrist, lawlessness will abound.
[03:36:30.980 --> 03:36:35.780]  Now is that only law and order falling in a country?
[03:36:35.780 --> 03:36:37.820]  Is that a police state installed?
[03:36:37.820 --> 03:36:44.220]  Yes, there will be an authoritarian, psychotic machine that the world has never seen before,
[03:36:44.220 --> 03:36:48.780]  but you will see total degeneracy at the same time, because it will be lawlessness
[03:36:48.780 --> 03:36:55.420]  also in the heart, it'll be lawlessness also with those casting away the law of God, casting
[03:36:55.420 --> 03:37:00.260]  away morality that they've been given because God's law has been written on our hearts.
[03:37:00.260 --> 03:37:05.900]  These end times will be accompanied with a lawlessness that you have never even seen or
[03:37:05.900 --> 03:37:11.900]  experienced before, that the world, that planet Earth, that's why Jesus came out and said
[03:37:11.900 --> 03:37:19.620]  as in the days of Noah shall be these times, these times of the end of the world, the times
[03:37:19.620 --> 03:37:23.100]  of the Antichrist, the end days.
[03:37:23.100 --> 03:37:27.180]  And they'll probably be even worse, because you see Romans chapter one and you see the
[03:37:27.180 --> 03:37:33.300]  ultimate degeneracy, you see the attack on traditional biological marriage, getting traded
[03:37:33.300 --> 03:37:40.580]  in for something perverted, inverted and disgusting, which is also accompanied with mass mental
[03:37:40.580 --> 03:37:45.580]  illness and mass instability, that's what the so-called trans movement literally is,
[03:37:45.580 --> 03:37:50.580]  whether it's adult or child, that's literally what it is.
[03:37:50.580 --> 03:37:55.420]  And the truth is going to hurt, but the truth is going to unlock, and open rebuke is better
[03:37:55.420 --> 03:37:57.620]  than concealed with love.
[03:37:57.620 --> 03:38:07.140]  The Christian is given the task to expose and unveil what is being done in the darkness.
[03:38:07.140 --> 03:38:14.260]  And all of these are New World Order Antichrist systems that are meant to depopulate the Earth
[03:38:14.260 --> 03:38:20.700]  and plunge humanity into a place of desperate, desperate times to where you accept and you
[03:38:20.700 --> 03:38:25.820]  willfully accept the authoritarian regime yourself.
[03:38:25.820 --> 03:38:32.660]  Has God not mandated biological procreation in the context of holy matrimony between a
[03:38:32.660 --> 03:38:35.660]  biological male and a biological female?
[03:38:35.660 --> 03:38:39.460]  Is that biblical doctrine from the very beginning of mankind?
[03:38:39.460 --> 03:38:40.540]  Yes.
[03:38:40.540 --> 03:38:47.180]  Anything outside of that is not only heretical, I would go as far to say doctrines of demons,
[03:38:47.180 --> 03:38:53.500]  because it's Antichrist, it's the literal opposite of what God has instituted for mankind
[03:38:53.500 --> 03:38:59.480]  from the very beginning, from the very jump, from the very start of who we are as a civilization.
[03:38:59.480 --> 03:39:01.780]  This is fundamental to our existence.
[03:39:01.780 --> 03:39:04.000]  That's why it's depopulation.
[03:39:04.000 --> 03:39:09.400]  That's why on a scientific, on a physical, biological level, it is depopulation.
[03:39:09.400 --> 03:39:19.080]  You will not, you cannot have a society that has a future that does not practice biological
[03:39:19.080 --> 03:39:24.880]  procreation, especially in the context of holy matrimony.
[03:39:24.880 --> 03:39:26.720]  You will spread disease.
[03:39:26.720 --> 03:39:30.080]  You will have to result to abducting children.
[03:39:30.080 --> 03:39:36.280]  You will have to eventually result to going back to biological procreation, biological
[03:39:36.280 --> 03:39:41.960]  male, biological female, because the homosexual community, the so-called trans community,
[03:39:41.960 --> 03:39:47.120]  which is all just gay anyways, has no biological future.
[03:39:47.120 --> 03:39:51.760]  That's just the reality of this situation.
[03:39:51.760 --> 03:39:53.840]  Now is that what God desires?
[03:39:53.840 --> 03:39:57.880]  Because we can't sit here and say, well, we're anti-depopulation, but we're not going to
[03:39:57.880 --> 03:40:00.960]  address this part of it.
[03:40:00.960 --> 03:40:06.680]  As a Christian, like I said, who gets to fundamentally determine what is truth?
[03:40:06.680 --> 03:40:09.360]  Now is telling the truth to someone, is that hate?
[03:40:09.360 --> 03:40:13.920]  Well, that's how the deep state and the authoritarian regime is seeking, and the New World Order
[03:40:13.920 --> 03:40:16.560]  is seeking to define that.
[03:40:16.560 --> 03:40:18.040]  Truth is hate.
[03:40:18.040 --> 03:40:19.040]  Truth is hate.
[03:40:19.040 --> 03:40:20.800]  Hate is truth.
[03:40:20.800 --> 03:40:21.800]  They're defining.
[03:40:21.800 --> 03:40:24.720]  That's why fact checkers all over Facebook, that's why it doesn't matter whether you're
[03:40:24.720 --> 03:40:26.160]  talking about kids or an adult.
[03:40:26.160 --> 03:40:27.160]  It doesn't matter.
[03:40:27.160 --> 03:40:31.280]  Across the entire board, they're creating protected classes because it's about censorship
[03:40:31.280 --> 03:40:37.880]  and shutting down anyone that comes out in what tells the truth.
[03:40:37.880 --> 03:40:43.240]  Is the truth meant to be a sniper bullet of hate?
[03:40:43.240 --> 03:40:48.360]  Or is the truth meant to be, metaphorically I'm speaking, a sniper bullet of truth and
[03:40:48.360 --> 03:40:52.280]  love in order to unlock the mind of those that are deceived?
[03:40:52.400 --> 03:40:58.880]  I would argue the Bible does teach that truth is meant to unlock those that are deceived
[03:40:58.880 --> 03:41:03.240]  because every single one of us that have come to Jesus, that have given our lives to Jesus,
[03:41:03.240 --> 03:41:07.520]  we all were degenerate at one point in our lives.
[03:41:07.520 --> 03:41:11.720]  So when we move forward, we don't walk in our past.
[03:41:11.720 --> 03:41:15.860]  We don't walk in the powerless inability of our past.
[03:41:15.860 --> 03:41:19.080]  But I will tell you, no one's perfect.
[03:41:19.080 --> 03:41:21.980]  But if you are living a double life, you have no power.
[03:41:21.980 --> 03:41:25.500]  That's why you don't believe you have the power to speak the truth of God.
[03:41:25.500 --> 03:41:27.140]  Doesn't mean you have to be perfect.
[03:41:27.140 --> 03:41:28.580]  But the Bible is very clear.
[03:41:28.580 --> 03:41:31.860]  You must be authentic about your profession in Christ.
[03:41:31.860 --> 03:41:36.220]  Obviously, you're going to struggle a little more than others or less than others.
[03:41:36.220 --> 03:41:40.240]  That's all determined between you and God.
[03:41:40.240 --> 03:41:46.820]  But you never sacrifice the truth and you will only sacrifice the truth if you yourself
[03:41:46.820 --> 03:41:47.820]  are compromised.
[03:41:47.820 --> 03:41:48.820]  Period.
[03:41:48.820 --> 03:41:49.820]  That's it.
[03:41:50.540 --> 03:41:54.700]  Doesn't mean you have to be because, you know, what they call theological circles, what I'm
[03:41:54.700 --> 03:41:58.140]  describing is what they call hyper grace.
[03:41:58.140 --> 03:42:03.640]  Hyper grace is the teaching and belief where no matter how bad something is, no matter
[03:42:03.640 --> 03:42:09.300]  how degenerate something is, no matter what, you don't address it righteously.
[03:42:09.300 --> 03:42:12.180]  You don't address it with any righteous discipline.
[03:42:12.180 --> 03:42:17.160]  You don't address it with any kind of righteous unveiling.
[03:42:17.160 --> 03:42:19.740]  You just allow it to keep going and going and going.
[03:42:19.740 --> 03:42:20.740]  Give it a pass.
[03:42:20.740 --> 03:42:21.740]  Give it a pass.
[03:42:21.740 --> 03:42:22.740]  Give it a pass.
[03:42:22.740 --> 03:42:23.740]  And nothing changes.
[03:42:23.740 --> 03:42:25.860]  That's not fundamentally what the Bible teaches.
[03:42:25.860 --> 03:42:32.100]  The Bible teaches repentance and acknowledge of truth and acknowledge of sin and acknowledge
[03:42:32.100 --> 03:42:34.180]  of your fallen state.
[03:42:34.180 --> 03:42:37.460]  And this not only goes beyond when you coming to Christ and you become born again.
[03:42:37.460 --> 03:42:38.460]  This goes beyond.
[03:42:38.460 --> 03:42:42.820]  This is part of what theologically we call your sanctification process.
[03:42:42.820 --> 03:42:44.980]  So now you go from, OK, I'm redeemed.
[03:42:44.980 --> 03:42:46.340]  I'm forgiven.
[03:42:46.340 --> 03:42:47.500]  I'm declared righteous.
[03:42:47.500 --> 03:42:54.460]  I'm positionally righteous and perfect before God, my position before God.
[03:42:54.460 --> 03:42:57.540]  I'm no longer at enmity with God.
[03:42:57.540 --> 03:43:00.400]  I am positionally perfect.
[03:43:00.400 --> 03:43:04.980]  If I were to die today, I'm going straight to heaven because of the blood of Jesus Christ
[03:43:04.980 --> 03:43:07.100]  is my salvation, right?
[03:43:07.100 --> 03:43:10.380]  I'm positionally there.
[03:43:10.380 --> 03:43:17.820]  But as we live this Christian experience, now you enter into the realm of sanctification.
[03:43:17.820 --> 03:43:19.260]  So now you grow in holiness.
[03:43:19.260 --> 03:43:20.660]  You grow in righteousness.
[03:43:20.660 --> 03:43:21.820]  You grow as a Christian.
[03:43:21.820 --> 03:43:23.300]  You grow in your discernment.
[03:43:23.300 --> 03:43:25.540]  You grow in your biblical understanding.
[03:43:25.540 --> 03:43:28.740]  You grow in how to live a Christ honoring life.
[03:43:28.740 --> 03:43:34.620]  You're not this perfect little holier than thou person, but you do grow in holiness.
[03:43:34.620 --> 03:43:38.860]  Anyone that comes out and claims to be a Christian and comes out and says, well, you know, God
[03:43:38.860 --> 03:43:42.420]  just forgives me and I just continue to live like hell every single day.
[03:43:42.420 --> 03:43:46.040]  You're a blasphemer of Christ.
[03:43:46.040 --> 03:43:51.940]  That renders the gospel powerless because the gospel is not only the power to forgive sin,
[03:43:51.940 --> 03:43:54.380]  but to free from sin.
[03:43:54.380 --> 03:43:56.300]  Now everyone has their own path.
[03:43:56.300 --> 03:43:58.300]  Everyone has their own journey.
[03:43:58.300 --> 03:44:03.220]  But as a Christian, we cannot sit here and compromise the truth because, A, we're compromised
[03:44:03.220 --> 03:44:04.220]  ourselves.
[03:44:04.340 --> 03:44:12.180]  And if you are, you need to repent and come to Christ and not shame others that are walking
[03:44:12.180 --> 03:44:17.660]  with Christ, walking in holiness and truly fighting on that front.
[03:44:17.660 --> 03:44:20.980]  We fight against the new world order, but I'll tell you, this personal walk with Christ,
[03:44:20.980 --> 03:44:24.260]  you fight, you fight this holy war.
[03:44:24.260 --> 03:44:26.740]  That's why the Bible says, flee youthful lusts.
[03:44:26.740 --> 03:44:29.740]  That's why the Bible says, flee unrighteousness.
[03:44:29.740 --> 03:44:34.140]  That's why the Bible says, really, you're either a slave to sin or you're a slave to
[03:44:34.140 --> 03:44:35.140]  God.
[03:44:35.140 --> 03:44:36.140]  It's either or.
[03:44:36.140 --> 03:44:40.980]  So, you know, what I'm, what I'm giving you guys is theology.
[03:44:40.980 --> 03:44:44.860]  I'm giving you guys some fundamental Christian teachings in the Bible, and it's going to
[03:44:44.860 --> 03:44:45.860]  offend people.
[03:44:45.860 --> 03:44:51.500]  But at the end of the day, like I said, when we opened up the show, who gets to determine
[03:44:51.500 --> 03:44:52.740]  what is true?
[03:44:52.740 --> 03:45:01.260]  You see, I, on one hand, believe that Jesus Christ not only is a accurate historical figure,
[03:45:01.260 --> 03:45:04.020]  it's very hard to disprove that, extremely hard.
[03:45:04.020 --> 03:45:10.580]  It is very hard to disprove the historical reality of Jesus Christ, an actual historical
[03:45:10.580 --> 03:45:11.580]  figure.
[03:45:11.580 --> 03:45:16.860]  And man, there's a reason why in the first century you do not see any atheism.
[03:45:16.860 --> 03:45:17.860]  You don't.
[03:45:17.860 --> 03:45:21.060]  I challenge anybody, anybody, anybody.
[03:45:21.060 --> 03:45:28.060]  Show me some atheism in the first century, the first hundred years of the existence of
[03:45:28.060 --> 03:45:29.380]  the church.
[03:45:29.380 --> 03:45:36.140]  Show me one piece of atheism in the form of Christ doesn't exist.
[03:45:36.140 --> 03:45:39.820]  Christ, God in human flesh doesn't exist.
[03:45:39.820 --> 03:45:40.820]  Show me.
[03:45:40.820 --> 03:45:41.820]  Show me.
[03:45:41.820 --> 03:45:42.820]  You want to know why?
[03:45:42.820 --> 03:45:47.860]  Because as famous as that man was in Galilee, you know, a lot of us think, oh, man, I only
[03:45:47.860 --> 03:45:49.220]  have 500 followers.
[03:45:49.380 --> 03:45:51.140]  I only have 1,000 followers.
[03:45:51.140 --> 03:45:54.540]  I only have 5,000 followers on Instagram.
[03:45:54.540 --> 03:45:58.260]  That's nothing compared to the people that have a million.
[03:45:58.260 --> 03:46:04.580]  You understand that Jesus had somewhere upwards, a lot of theologians believe around, I mean,
[03:46:04.580 --> 03:46:07.540]  he fed the 5,000, he fed the 7,000.
[03:46:07.540 --> 03:46:13.260]  Some theologians believe Jesus had crowds up to 10,000 people following him at once
[03:46:13.260 --> 03:46:14.500]  on foot.
[03:46:14.500 --> 03:46:22.220]  No social media, no TV, no radio, all word of mouth and the Holy Spirit working in the
[03:46:22.220 --> 03:46:25.740]  hearts of men at that time because the son of God was walking planet Earth.
[03:46:26.800 --> 03:46:28.800]  How do you deny that?
[03:46:28.800 --> 03:46:35.800]  How do you deny the multiple eyewitness accounts not only by the religious zealots and the Jews?
[03:46:35.800 --> 03:46:39.800]  Hey, even Nicodemus is a historical figure.
[03:46:39.800 --> 03:46:42.800]  Caiaphas, the high priest, is a historical figure.
[03:46:42.800 --> 03:46:45.800]  Jesus Christ, a historical figure as well.
[03:46:45.800 --> 03:46:48.800]  Pontius Pilate, a historical figure as well.
[03:46:48.800 --> 03:46:52.800]  All of the famous Bible characters of the New Testament,
[03:46:52.800 --> 03:46:56.800]  especially during the time of Jesus Christ on planet Earth,
[03:46:56.800 --> 03:47:00.800]  can be 100% authentically, historically verified.
[03:47:00.800 --> 03:47:04.800]  And you will not see people trying to say that Jesus Christ didn't exist.
[03:47:04.800 --> 03:47:08.800]  It would be like saying right now, in the 21st century, in 2023,
[03:47:08.800 --> 03:47:14.800]  50 years from now, that Donald J. Trump didn't exist.
[03:47:14.800 --> 03:47:16.800]  You see what I'm saying? Doesn't that sound absurd?
[03:47:16.800 --> 03:47:20.800]  Like 50 years from now? 100 years from now?
[03:47:21.800 --> 03:47:25.800]  Donald Trump was not an actual historical figure.
[03:47:27.800 --> 03:47:30.800]  Wow, really, right?
[03:47:30.800 --> 03:47:34.800]  And even right now, fast forward, 70 plus years later,
[03:47:34.800 --> 03:47:38.800]  imagine coming out and trying to say, well, Adolf Hitler didn't exist.
[03:47:38.800 --> 03:47:40.800]  He wasn't a real person.
[03:47:40.800 --> 03:47:48.800]  He was just a mythological figure that people drew up in their minds.
[03:47:49.800 --> 03:47:53.800]  Does that sound absurd to anybody?
[03:47:53.800 --> 03:47:57.800]  70 years, we're approaching 100 years later?
[03:47:57.800 --> 03:48:00.800]  Exactly. The point is, is the ultimate reality,
[03:48:00.800 --> 03:48:04.800]  it's very hard to disprove Jesus Christ being a historical figure,
[03:48:04.800 --> 03:48:06.800]  but the big question is, was he God?
[03:48:06.800 --> 03:48:08.800]  Because that's what got him crucified.
[03:48:08.800 --> 03:48:10.800]  That's what got him murdered.
[03:48:10.800 --> 03:48:12.800]  What was the ultimate charge?
[03:48:12.800 --> 03:48:18.800]  What drove the religious Jews and the Pharisees overboard
[03:48:18.800 --> 03:48:19.800]  when it came to Jesus?
[03:48:19.800 --> 03:48:23.800]  Okay, he was healing on the Sabbath. That's blasphemy.
[03:48:23.800 --> 03:48:27.800]  Okay, he's not really one of us.
[03:48:27.800 --> 03:48:29.800]  This kid is a revolutionary.
[03:48:29.800 --> 03:48:34.800]  He's going against our laws and traditions that go outside
[03:48:34.800 --> 03:48:38.800]  the Old Testament books of the Bible.
[03:48:38.800 --> 03:48:41.800]  All right, this guy, they viewed him as a heretic,
[03:48:41.800 --> 03:48:45.800]  but what was it that ultimately drove him over the edge?
[03:48:45.800 --> 03:48:46.800]  It was that he claimed to be God.
[03:48:46.800 --> 03:48:48.800]  He claimed to be God in human flesh.
[03:48:48.800 --> 03:48:51.800]  I am the I am.
[03:48:51.800 --> 03:48:54.800]  He claimed to be equal with God the Father.
[03:48:54.800 --> 03:48:56.800]  He claimed to be deity.
[03:48:56.800 --> 03:49:01.800]  That's what drove the religious Jews of the day to murder Jesus Christ.
[03:49:01.800 --> 03:49:06.800]  You see, that's the fundamental question that everybody has to ask themselves.
[03:49:06.800 --> 03:49:10.800]  Number one, not only does Jesus exist,
[03:49:10.800 --> 03:49:12.800]  is God even real?
[03:49:12.800 --> 03:49:16.800]  But also, is Jesus Christ God?
[03:49:16.800 --> 03:49:20.800]  Because if he's not God, then I have no hope.
[03:49:20.800 --> 03:49:21.800]  I have no power.
[03:49:21.800 --> 03:49:26.800]  I have no assurance of salvation.
[03:49:26.800 --> 03:49:30.800]  Because you got to ask yourself, this is the ultimate Christ pill
[03:49:30.800 --> 03:49:33.800]  for a lot of people that they don't understand.
[03:49:33.800 --> 03:49:36.800]  If Jesus Christ is truly God,
[03:49:36.800 --> 03:49:39.800]  if Jesus Christ is truly a historical figure,
[03:49:39.800 --> 03:49:45.800]  his life, his death, burial, and resurrection
[03:49:45.800 --> 03:49:48.800]  can all be historically proven,
[03:49:48.800 --> 03:49:51.800]  then what does that mean?
[03:49:51.800 --> 03:49:52.800]  What does that mean?
[03:49:52.800 --> 03:49:54.800]  Was he just a religious historical figure?
[03:49:54.800 --> 03:49:55.800]  What does that really mean?
[03:49:55.800 --> 03:50:00.800]  What are the implications that you could literally prove
[03:50:00.800 --> 03:50:03.800]  the historical resurrection of Jesus Christ?
[03:50:03.800 --> 03:50:06.800]  People saw him alive.
[03:50:06.800 --> 03:50:09.800]  The same guy that was murdered publicly,
[03:50:09.800 --> 03:50:11.800]  executed by the Romans,
[03:50:11.800 --> 03:50:15.800]  colluded by the Jews and the religious zealots of the day,
[03:50:15.800 --> 03:50:18.800]  instigated, conspired.
[03:50:18.800 --> 03:50:21.800]  Those same people, that same public
[03:50:21.800 --> 03:50:25.800]  that watched him ride in on the donkey on Palm Sunday.
[03:50:25.800 --> 03:50:27.800]  Hosea, Hosea, Hosea in the highest.
[03:50:27.800 --> 03:50:28.800]  He's here.
[03:50:28.800 --> 03:50:29.800]  Our king is here.
[03:50:29.800 --> 03:50:31.800]  They thought they had a human king.
[03:50:31.800 --> 03:50:32.800]  Oh no, he's a failure.
[03:50:32.800 --> 03:50:33.800]  Look at him.
[03:50:33.800 --> 03:50:34.800]  He's not our king.
[03:50:34.800 --> 03:50:37.800]  He's being crucified by the Romans.
[03:50:37.800 --> 03:50:38.800]  Take yourself down from there.
[03:50:38.800 --> 03:50:40.800]  We thought you were a king.
[03:50:40.800 --> 03:50:42.800]  You claimed that you were going to usher in the kingdom.
[03:50:42.800 --> 03:50:44.800]  You said you were going to destroy the temple.
[03:50:44.800 --> 03:50:47.800]  You claimed that you were going to revamp everything.
[03:50:47.800 --> 03:50:48.800]  We thought you were the one.
[03:50:48.800 --> 03:50:49.800]  They turned the same.
[03:50:49.800 --> 03:50:51.800]  This was public.
[03:50:51.800 --> 03:50:54.800]  Thousands of people that publicly
[03:50:54.800 --> 03:50:58.800]  viewed him as the king of the Jews
[03:50:58.800 --> 03:51:00.800]  then mocked him
[03:51:00.800 --> 03:51:02.800]  in their arrogant, ignorant minds
[03:51:02.800 --> 03:51:05.800]  when they didn't realize he is the eternal king
[03:51:05.800 --> 03:51:07.800]  of the Jews.
[03:51:07.800 --> 03:51:11.800]  And he will usher in the eternal kingdom of heaven.
[03:51:11.800 --> 03:51:14.800]  And he will return and reign and rule
[03:51:14.800 --> 03:51:16.800]  but he had to take care of sin first.
[03:51:16.800 --> 03:51:18.800]  What does that mean?
[03:51:18.800 --> 03:51:19.800]  What does that mean when there are
[03:51:19.800 --> 03:51:22.800]  multiple thousands of eyewitnesses historically
[03:51:22.800 --> 03:51:25.800]  that not only watched him
[03:51:25.800 --> 03:51:29.800]  identify as a king, they received him as a king
[03:51:29.800 --> 03:51:32.800]  but because he got captured by the Romans
[03:51:32.800 --> 03:51:36.800]  crucified and publicly humiliated by the Romans
[03:51:36.800 --> 03:51:37.800]  they threw him aside.
[03:51:37.800 --> 03:51:38.800]  They cast him aside.
[03:51:38.800 --> 03:51:40.800]  They began to mock him.
[03:51:40.800 --> 03:51:41.800]  Look at him.
[03:51:41.800 --> 03:51:42.800]  Look at you, you piece of trash.
[03:51:42.800 --> 03:51:44.800]  We thought you were our guy.
[03:51:44.800 --> 03:51:47.800]  We thought you were our guy.
[03:51:47.800 --> 03:51:49.800]  And those same people.
[03:51:51.200 --> 03:51:56.200]  The same one that they received, then turned their back on
[03:51:56.200 --> 03:52:01.200]  because he was publicly executed, saw him resurrected.
[03:52:01.200 --> 03:52:05.200]  Man, you have to really deal with this.
[03:52:05.200 --> 03:52:08.200]  This is a historical reality.
[03:52:08.200 --> 03:52:14.200]  If this is true, which it is for me because I've dug into this,
[03:52:14.200 --> 03:52:19.200]  I have tried so hard to find a problem with this
[03:52:19.200 --> 03:52:25.200]  and can only come to the conclusion, okay, not only is this real,
[03:52:25.200 --> 03:52:30.200]  but Jesus Christ died and rose from the grave.
[03:52:30.200 --> 03:52:34.200]  Dude, the implications of this is he's not just a historical figure.
[03:52:34.200 --> 03:52:37.200]  He's not just a revolutionary religious figure.
[03:52:37.200 --> 03:52:42.200]  He's not just some kind of anti-establishment figure
[03:52:42.200 --> 03:52:46.200]  that had a following and then died.
[03:52:46.700 --> 03:52:51.700]  If he rose from the grave, then he must be really God.
[03:52:51.700 --> 03:52:55.700]  Because who has the keys to life? Who has the keys to defeat death?
[03:52:55.700 --> 03:52:57.700]  Who really has that?
[03:52:57.700 --> 03:53:05.700]  Not only to claim eternal life, but to come out and deliver on eternal life.
[03:53:05.700 --> 03:53:10.700]  He is the path. He is the way. That's why he claimed, I am the truth.
[03:53:11.900 --> 03:53:33.900]  So, the reason why, you know, I wasn't planning on breaking this down today, but I think the reason why we are living in such a critical time, we're going against the New World Order, we're going against false gods, we're going up against false ideologies, false gospels, we're going up against anti-Christ systems.
[03:53:33.900 --> 03:53:58.900]  That's what the New World Order is, biblically. Anti-Christ systems, ideas, ideologies, when you address homosexuality, when you address the death jabs, when you address the so-called trans issue, whether it's kids or adults, like, I love people enough to sit here and say, yeah, I don't want to see you mutilating your body.
[03:53:58.900 --> 03:54:15.900]  Why is it that when a young kid becomes a cutter, or even an adult, when a young kid or an adult becomes a cutter, you guys know what I'm talking about, it's demonic, it's satanic, it's sad. I was a youth pastor for six years and I had to deal with this, with the youth and our youth group.
[03:54:15.900 --> 03:54:39.900]  These young kids get these ideas in their minds where they're depressed and they're hurt, there's something inside of them that's driving them to suicide or trying to relieve the pain by slitting their wrists. You guys have seen people like this. The kids in our youth group, they would, you know, I'd have to talk to their parents about this because their whole arms, their whole wrists, mutilated, sliced.
[03:54:40.900 --> 03:55:02.900]  They would take it even to their necks. Anywhere there was a vein on the back of their knees or some of them would even go as far as their heels, their Achilles, it's crazy stuff. You know, when you see that, any person is like, oh my gosh, dude, like, why are you doing that? Like, what's going on in here? That's not the remedy.
[03:55:03.900 --> 03:55:25.900]  The remedy to the broken heart, the remedy to the mental instability, the remedy to the depression, the remedy to what's going on in here is not a physical mutilation of your body. Yeah, you might experience some kind of like relief of pain, maybe some kind of emotional temporary little high, but the pain always remains.
[03:55:26.900 --> 03:55:47.900]  Why is it when we deal with cutters in the youth or deal with cutters even in adults? Oh, well, that's obviously demonic. But when it comes to this so-called trans mutilation of genitals in youth and adults, oh, well, you know, we got to make sure we're not hurting anybody's feelings.
[03:55:47.900 --> 03:56:05.900]  To me, arguably, I would say the hacking of genitals of children and adults is probably even worse and more satanic and antichrist than just cutting. I would say that's taking it to the next level. Oh, because you got something in here and you think that the remedy is physical.
[03:56:07.900 --> 03:56:09.900]  To make it right again or to make you feel better.
[03:56:11.900 --> 03:56:17.779]  Well at the end of the day fundamentally as a Christian that's a botch. That's an
[03:56:17.779 --> 03:56:22.779]  attack of a human being made in the image of God. Whether it's a child or not.
[03:56:22.779 --> 03:56:27.140]  Because if you've been biologically engineered by God this is the
[03:56:27.140 --> 03:56:32.820]  depopulation. This is the attack on God. This is the Antichrist agenda and it
[03:56:32.820 --> 03:56:37.980]  must all be addressed. Death, jabs, like I said, abortion, murder, it must all be
[03:56:37.980 --> 03:56:41.980]  addressed. Homosexuality, it must all be addressed. The so-called trans movement
[03:56:41.980 --> 03:56:49.220]  whether youth, minor or adult, it must all be addressed. Whether the climate cult.
[03:56:48.500 --> 03:56:53.500]  Pulling fossil fuels, all depopulation.
[03:56:53.500 --> 03:56:55.500]  All depopulation.
[03:56:55.500 --> 03:56:57.500]  Poisoning the food systemically.
[03:56:57.500 --> 03:56:59.500]  Poisoning the water systemically.
[03:56:59.500 --> 03:57:01.500]  Chemically destroying human beings.
[03:57:01.500 --> 03:57:05.500]  It's an attempt to thwart the human race
[03:57:05.500 --> 03:57:07.500]  from the fundamental command
[03:57:07.800 --> 03:57:17.220]  that was given to mankind. Be fruitful and multiply. Be fruitful and multiply. Holy matrimony.
[03:57:17.220 --> 03:57:25.960]  Not in fornication. Holy matrimony. God established marriage. So I guess the question is this.
[03:57:25.960 --> 03:57:32.279]  What side are you on? You have to decide. Every single one of us have to decide every
[03:57:32.279 --> 03:57:37.800]  single day. Determine what is true. You'll find it. The truth shall, what, set you free?
[03:57:37.800 --> 03:57:44.519]  Seek, knock, you will find. Come to Christ because he is the truth. Not the suggestion,
[03:57:44.519 --> 03:57:47.640]  but he is.
