[00:50.680 --> 00:54.760]  here in FEMA region six where just everywhere you turn there are just
[00:54.760 --> 00:58.840]  floods of illegal aliens pouring across being greeted by bureaucrats and
[00:58.840 --> 01:04.120]  lawyers women with multiple children in tow
[01:04.960 --> 01:08.920]  having them handed over to the government and churches to instantly go on
[01:08.920 --> 01:16.040]  welfare and then to instantly be given driver's license to then vote our own
[01:16.040 --> 01:20.320]  David Knight got rammed by an illegal alien the other day and the guy was like
[01:20.320 --> 01:26.200]  crazy ramming him with a dump truck into the street across the red light and the
[01:26.200 --> 01:29.000]  cops got there and just said we're not gonna do anything he's above the law
[01:29.000 --> 01:33.040]  there's nothing you can do and they basically saluted the guy and that was
[01:33.040 --> 01:37.600]  the end of it and I've talked to Travis County prosecutors who have senior ones
[01:37.600 --> 01:42.600]  who've come to this office senior ones and said you need to look into this I'm
[01:42.600 --> 01:46.680]  like look into it I know about it and they're like listen police are told
[01:46.680 --> 01:51.400]  don't bring them in or the judge gives them a five to twenty dollar fine all
[01:51.400 --> 01:54.840]  they do is give the illegal a five or twenty dollar fine they tell the police
[01:54.840 --> 01:59.640]  you get plump citizens they are the schmucks they are the suckers they are
[01:59.640 --> 02:05.040]  the jokes they are the target they are the enemy you got a American citizen
[02:05.040 --> 02:08.200]  with three kids in the back obviously working two jobs that have any money
[02:08.200 --> 02:12.440]  hit them and hit them hard driver into bankruptcy driver into clowered and
[02:12.440 --> 02:18.280]  heaven but if it's any legal I've read you the AP headline Bloomberg also
[02:18.280 --> 02:23.920]  reported on it Chris Jordan was able to find it just a few weeks ago was an
[02:23.920 --> 02:30.880]  article from 2005 where the banks presidents were bragging to AP that
[02:30.880 --> 02:37.320]  yes we give them bank loans that no one else gets with no IDs because we want
[02:37.320 --> 02:41.160]  to be friendly and help know the globalist want an incentive to bankrupt
[02:41.160 --> 02:44.520]  the country and once it's bankrupted then the illegals won't get a free ride
[02:44.520 --> 02:48.240]  anymore so this isn't even about a hatred of the illegals if I was an
[02:48.240 --> 02:51.600]  implode third-world country and there was a place with better opportunities I
[02:51.600 --> 02:54.920]  would come up here if I was a Mexican woman and had two kids and my husband
[02:54.920 --> 02:59.960]  and run off and I was living in a dirt floor shack down and on the suburbs of
[02:59.960 --> 03:04.040]  Mexico City I'd get on a bus and come up here and come right into the waiting
[03:04.040 --> 03:08.920]  arms and they go senorita all you got to do is vote for the Democrats and you'll
[03:08.920 --> 03:15.560]  get everything you want well what's she gonna do now there is CNN money banking
[03:15.560 --> 03:18.640]  on illegal immigrants banks are seeing an untapped resource of providing
[03:18.640 --> 03:23.440]  home loans un-documented US residents that's a similar article along the AP
[03:23.440 --> 03:28.720]  and Bloomberg article was back in 2005 as I said they had an advertisement see
[03:28.720 --> 03:33.000]  learn how media works that's why my brain burns when I see the news that's
[03:33.000 --> 03:36.200]  very painful even try to explain it because I have too much proof it's like
[03:36.200 --> 03:41.040]  putting on a prosecution per article slam dunk prosecutions you've still got
[03:41.040 --> 03:45.840]  to put on the slam dunk prosecution and if the public can't see it I don't know
[03:45.840 --> 03:51.160]  what to do but they had all these articles telling the illegals you can go
[03:51.160 --> 03:54.280]  get a home loan you can go get a home loan and then who bailed all that out
[03:54.280 --> 03:59.680]  taxpayer again well you don't think it Atlanta and Austin Texas a few years
[03:59.680 --> 04:05.560]  ago when it came out that per address eighty six million dollars a hundred and
[04:05.560 --> 04:10.280]  fifty one million dollars these were addresses in Atlanta and Austin Texas
[04:10.280 --> 04:14.800]  that were getting tax returns where you would have listed five people as
[04:14.800 --> 04:20.400]  residents getting eighty six million dollars by the way no prosecutions no
[04:20.400 --> 04:25.800]  investigations where do you think eighty six million dollars went it was
[04:25.800 --> 04:29.840]  laundered back into the Democratic Party and the Republicans at playball
[04:29.840 --> 04:34.760]  that's why there's a criminal takeover because they're robbing everything you
[04:34.760 --> 04:39.200]  don't think the illegals in the house got eighty six mil do you they're lucky
[04:39.200 --> 04:44.120]  they got a hundred grand they the globalist using legals as the underground
[04:44.120 --> 04:48.880]  black market that they can run all the drugs the law of the money the sex all
[04:48.880 --> 04:52.520]  of it through those groups then any other group tries to run a criminal off

[10:43.880 --> 10:49.520]  to be patriots or not they're nothing more than domestic parents that's what
[10:49.520 --> 10:53.780]  Cobra would say that's what specter would say that's what Goldfinger would
[10:53.780 --> 10:58.040]  say because that's who those people are
[10:58.040 --> 11:06.360]  Cobra commander you call your penny bureaucrats officials and authorities

[11:35.720 --> 11:39.680]  together from past statements I've made you're a TV viewer you can see the free
[11:39.680 --> 11:43.480]  feeds at info wars.com forward slash show or if you're a subscriber of her
[11:43.480 --> 11:50.760]  prison planet TV but I think the audio transfers over to the main audience the
[11:50.760 --> 11:54.840]  radio listeners want to welcome everyone to the main transmission here today it
[11:54.840 --> 12:03.160]  is Tuesday the 17th day of June 2014 we are going to first break down the fact
[12:03.160 --> 12:08.880]  and my crew is looking for it but we don't mark down every word I say but
[12:08.880 --> 12:16.680]  everyone knows that since Benghazi took place a few years ago even before that
[12:16.680 --> 12:22.680]  with the Libya situation the West is giving high-tech modern surface-to-air
[12:22.680 --> 12:29.480]  anti-aircraft missiles to certified real Al Qaeda to their command base in
[12:29.480 --> 12:33.320]  Benghazi which then took over all of Libya they even had the weapons last
[12:33.320 --> 12:40.360]  year shooting them at helicopters in the country of Egypt till the military
[12:40.360 --> 12:44.400]  crossed them and CNN called the military you know violent terrorist because
[12:44.400 --> 12:52.480]  they dare fight back against Al Qaeda and now it is on Fox News CNN you name it
[12:52.480 --> 12:59.400]  oh we've got to take your rights because Al Qaeda and ISIS have gotten
[12:59.400 --> 13:04.080]  stinger missiles why they must have overrun US bases and found them will
[13:04.080 --> 13:08.160]  just lying there like US military pulls out of bases and just leave stinger
[13:08.160 --> 13:11.280]  missiles laying there on the ground
[13:11.840 --> 13:16.640]  remember last week last Friday I shot a video of a 20-minute special report for
[13:16.640 --> 13:20.280]  the nightly news where I showed the Pentagon putting out statements to the
[13:20.280 --> 13:26.280]  AP that oh we think ISIS was connected to Al Qaeda might have found some of our
[13:26.280 --> 13:31.680]  weapons at bases that we left behind that that's why they've got US weapons
[13:31.680 --> 13:39.080]  uh-huh uh-huh and then they have the neocons come in and give Obama cover
[13:39.080 --> 13:43.760]  knowing he's not doing enough he should invade and blow up Al Qaeda they know
[13:43.760 --> 13:47.400]  full well they armed Al Qaeda along with the Republican Democratic Party backing
[13:47.400 --> 13:50.520]  it in the last three and a half years to attack Syria right on the border and they
[13:50.520 --> 13:54.080]  took over part of Syria and use that as a command base right across the border
[13:54.080 --> 13:58.560]  from Iraq and the Iraqi military in the last three months has been blowing up
[13:58.560 --> 14:03.840]  military bases and convoys as they try to come across the border and they know
[14:03.840 --> 14:10.560]  Al Qaeda has taken over for Fallujah to crit in other areas and it's been on the
[14:10.560 --> 14:17.240]  back burner in our news there have been giant five mile long convoys of well
[14:17.240 --> 14:23.360]  organized vehicles with medium and light weapons and high-tech weapons pouring
[14:23.360 --> 14:27.480]  across you don't think they couldn't have had a bunch of drones come in and
[14:27.480 --> 14:32.400]  take them out highway of death style like 1991 when Saddam's forces fled out
[14:32.400 --> 14:42.680]  of Kuwait back into Iraq Obama's golfing in Palm Springs looking at his
[14:42.680 --> 14:48.160]  retirement home while Obama doesn't know what's going on this is a Saudi
[14:48.160 --> 14:53.880]  Arabian proxy army and I of course said that months ago years ago but months
[14:53.880 --> 14:58.000]  ago so they were getting ready to take down Iraq at least the entire bottom
[14:58.000 --> 15:03.680]  half of it because that's the globalist plan they've had these guys take over
[15:03.680 --> 15:12.800]  Libya try to take over Syria try to take over Egypt that's how evil our so-called
[15:12.800 --> 15:17.080]  government is folks that they would try to turn the stable government of Egypt
[15:17.080 --> 15:24.080]  35 years working with the United States from an old policy set up when JFK left
[15:24.080 --> 15:28.320]  office at LBJ to stabilize the reason Christians Muslims could live in peace
[15:28.320 --> 15:31.840]  you can buy property there you could be left alone you could be a good tourist
[15:31.840 --> 15:39.960]  prosperity for the country that is now gone and how many times did I tell you
[15:39.960 --> 15:43.320]  we've got to find the clip I mean we've got to just start I guess paying to have
[15:43.320 --> 15:48.240]  a transcript made every day would cost probably $400 $300 a day but the
[15:48.240 --> 15:51.120]  computers are getting good enough to do it so just search and turn everything
[15:51.120 --> 15:54.480]  into a word document every day like the NSA does there by his phone
[15:54.480 --> 15:58.080]  conversations we should do it ourselves so we can search my comments but I
[15:58.080 --> 16:08.000]  probably let's not exaggerate I probably said 150 times because I did it on
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.840]  dozens of broadcasts and I would do it each time over and over again on each
[16:10.840 --> 16:16.000]  broadcast that you will hear them say Al Qaeda affiliated groups have gotten
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.760]  stinger modern stinger missiles these aren't left over from the 80s well the
[16:20.760 --> 16:24.720]  CIA gave it to them and they're gonna shoot down airliners in the US and
[16:24.720 --> 16:29.160]  Europe we've got to take your liberties because Al Qaeda's now got service to
[16:29.160 --> 16:33.960]  air missiles it'll shoot down airliners last night in this morning all I heard
[16:33.960 --> 16:37.280]  was see we need homeland security more than ever we need checkpoints on the
[16:37.280 --> 16:43.440]  highways I saw Senator Mendez it just went on and on saying this is all got
[16:43.440 --> 16:53.160]  to be done because of the fact that stinger missiles are about to kill us
[16:53.160 --> 16:58.640]  right now and all it'll take is some private contractors or they'll even use
[16:58.640 --> 17:01.360]  a cutout group of real Muslim extremists who think they're actually
[17:01.360 --> 17:05.520]  fighting for Allah that will shoot down they're probably fire four stinger
[17:05.520 --> 17:09.000]  missiles I don't have a global stop rate this is how they'll do it they'll get
[17:09.000 --> 17:14.400]  outside Dallas or DC or wherever and they'll pick you know aircraft taken off
[17:14.400 --> 17:18.560]  with the folks going to Europe for holiday or whatever and they'll wait
[17:18.560 --> 17:22.760]  till two jets take off they'll have four because it needs to be spectacular and
[17:22.760 --> 17:26.200]  they'll shoot them all down right there and then that'll disappear and they'll
[17:26.200 --> 17:30.560]  find a car I say this to ruin their plans they'll find a car with all the
[17:30.560 --> 17:34.240]  Arabic and why they did it and everything maybe even blaming it on Iran
[17:34.240 --> 17:38.200]  doesn't matter Iran's the opposite group I've now heard them saying Shiites are
[17:38.200 --> 17:43.040]  really al-Qaeda and that Iran I saw that on Fox and CNN yesterday I'm now
[17:43.040 --> 17:47.840]  monitoring enemy transmissions even more because of how they operate I can
[17:47.840 --> 17:51.160]  learn a lot because they like to pre-program I need the exact pre-programming
[17:51.160 --> 17:54.400]  understand what they're planning because they talk to you like your unconscious
[17:54.400 --> 17:58.600]  idiots you know they say you kept your doctor you can't keep it this lowered
[17:58.600 --> 18:01.280]  your price even though it increased it you didn't build your business raising
[18:01.280 --> 18:04.520]  the debt limit doesn't raise it they talk to you like you have a 45 IQ and
[18:04.520 --> 18:09.120]  can't talk they talk to you like you're two years old even a two-year-old has
[18:09.120 --> 18:13.720]  a certain that knows it's alive and so I'm seeing pre-programming and I'm
[18:13.720 --> 18:17.200]  telling you it won't matter when I get up and say see I told you I'll be the
[18:17.200 --> 18:24.440]  trader who doesn't care about the lives of the dead people you know how dare
[18:24.440 --> 18:29.320]  Alex Jones say the Stinger missile attack on the jet airliners in DC or
[18:29.320 --> 18:34.240]  Dallas or LA how dare him or Chicago because they want a place with a lot of
[18:34.240 --> 18:40.320]  media to cover it the way they want how dare him side with Iran and say they
[18:40.320 --> 18:47.080]  didn't do it even though we exposed the chemical weapons attack three times that
[18:47.080 --> 18:51.720]  Saudi Arabia launched against Assad to blame him later came out in in Psyhurst
[18:51.720 --> 18:57.560]  New Yorker magazine everywhere BBC it was staged admitted with Turkey as well
[18:57.560 --> 19:01.520]  so if I was the globalist and then I could see all their pre-planning they're
[19:01.520 --> 19:04.280]  doing exactly what I would do if I was them you could see the whole thing
[19:04.280 --> 19:07.720]  unfolding so let's go ahead and play Megan Kelly on Fox News we got a bunch

[24:44.840 --> 24:49.320]  and everybody knows I told you what Benghazi was about
[24:49.320 --> 24:56.920]  it was about plausible deniability and I knew 100% last week when I saw a bunch
[24:56.920 --> 25:02.680]  of articles in a major domestic Pentagon push where they domestically engaged in
[25:02.680 --> 25:06.840]  what was illegal until last year propaganda lies
[25:06.840 --> 25:14.520]  saying oh Al Qaeda and and ISIS they just got the missiles left in some bases
[25:14.520 --> 25:22.040]  in Iraq uh-huh that's right
[25:22.040 --> 25:26.760]  and boy that's why Obama's doing nothing but now he sent
[25:26.760 --> 25:33.560]  200 and something troops to the big giant embassy to make sure Al Qaeda doesn't get it
[25:33.560 --> 25:39.080]  uh-huh Al Qaeda will probably shoot a few mortars at the base
[25:39.080 --> 25:43.000]  in the middle of the night and may even kill a few real troops just to make it
[25:43.000 --> 25:46.360]  look like there's a fight going on because the troops don't know it's all
[25:46.360 --> 25:50.440]  staged just like the Al Qaeda is going to kill
[25:50.440 --> 25:57.160]  U.S. personnel and contractors because it's real folks it's real wars it's just
[25:57.160 --> 26:01.640]  it's the same group at the top running it to take over nation states because
[26:01.640 --> 26:07.400]  stability and the people and freedom and civilization is the target
[26:07.400 --> 26:11.560]  it's called destabilization is the big new brazinski's written
[26:11.560 --> 26:17.960]  not one not two not three not four but five books
[26:17.960 --> 26:23.240]  and guess who read all five of them
[26:24.280 --> 26:31.080]  i read his technotronic era when i was 14 years old
[26:31.080 --> 26:34.840]  you know why growing up i wasn't allowed to watch television except
[26:34.840 --> 26:40.440]  watch pbs or saturday morning cartoons and the house was just full of political
[26:40.440 --> 26:44.840]  science books and i always thought his books had the coolest covers
[26:44.840 --> 26:48.360]  had all these little squiggly lines and green and yellow shapes and
[26:48.360 --> 26:53.400]  i wanted to read it i wanted to read the road to serfdom
[26:53.400 --> 26:56.920]  i wanted to read all of it you know what i did and i guess that's why i'm a
[26:56.920 --> 27:00.680]  weirdo see when i was 14 i wasn't just a bookworm i was
[27:00.680 --> 27:04.120]  playing football and dating girls and everything else but i always wanted to
[27:04.120 --> 27:08.200]  run back at night and stay up late and read subbingin brazinski
[27:08.200 --> 27:11.640]  where he admitted the elite run the narcotics and the elite control all the
[27:11.640 --> 27:15.240]  major criminal groups because that's how we maintain order is by controlling the
[27:15.240 --> 27:19.560]  evil and then i read maccha belly when i was 16
[27:19.560 --> 27:23.000]  the same year i read mine comp for my struggle
[27:23.000 --> 27:26.280]  and so i just had this top political science education
[27:26.280 --> 27:32.120]  by the time i was about 18 years old because it was so entertaining i didn't
[27:32.120 --> 27:36.440]  realize what i was even reading at the time it was just so interesting
[27:36.440 --> 27:39.960]  mass executions every other page in order of death
[27:39.960 --> 27:47.080]  by heim's hobble and page turner in rise and fall the third right by sheer
[27:47.080 --> 27:50.680]  the battle for gull by julius caesar i was reading
[27:50.680 --> 27:54.600]  caesar's words written 2050 something years ago
[27:54.600 --> 28:00.280]  about out of control populations and so in high school and college i i said
[28:00.280 --> 28:03.640]  my god this is everything i read they're doing it now
[28:03.640 --> 28:07.400]  and public if you can learn how this stuff works if i could learn how this
[28:07.400 --> 28:10.600]  works we can turn this around but you must discover
[28:10.600 --> 28:14.360]  how you're controlled and then you can say they're going to take the bengazi
[28:14.360 --> 28:18.680]  stinger missiles and they're going to hold europe and the united states hostage
[28:18.680 --> 28:22.280]  and the elite here are going to take all of our rights in the next phase
[28:22.280 --> 28:29.400]  of stinger terror but only by exposing the enemy's next move
[28:29.400 --> 28:34.920]  can we stop them we can pull up the washington times two years ago showing
[28:34.920 --> 28:38.040]  saudi arabian nationals do not have their burqas taken off
[28:38.040 --> 28:42.840]  and are not searched because they won't have it they're they're not compliant
[28:42.840 --> 28:47.320]  their government controls our government to a great extent
[28:48.680 --> 28:56.600]  only the american people let folks stick their hands in their babies diaper
[28:56.600 --> 29:00.920]  what other country publicly lets their wives be groped by men with
[29:00.920 --> 29:05.080]  perv mustaches and potbellies

[33:49.560 --> 33:53.880]  that that they put online and bragged about but today we learned that the
[33:53.880 --> 33:56.360]  same group may now be in possession of a deadly
[33:56.360 --> 34:00.200]  cash of american-made choir power stinger missiles
[34:00.200 --> 34:04.520]  they are powerful enough to take down a commercial airliner
[34:04.520 --> 34:11.000]  well that's uh last night megan kelly uh ladies and gentlemen on record
[34:11.000 --> 34:15.240]  Saudi Arabia is in their own newspapers curt nemo's written articles
[34:15.240 --> 34:22.200]  bragging that this is a holy caliphate of the sunni which are the majority
[34:22.200 --> 34:27.640]  of muslims worldwide taking over the shiai nation of iraq
[34:27.640 --> 34:32.040]  and i watch for read zarkaria the billardberg group member and i watched
[34:32.040 --> 34:36.840]  him all he was on msnbc this morning that was cnn
[34:36.840 --> 34:41.960]  i was on the elliptical living through channels talk about how
[34:41.960 --> 34:49.880]  the leader of iraq maliki is a thug and a shiai evil man
[34:49.880 --> 34:52.680]  and that this is what he basically deserves
[34:52.680 --> 34:57.080]  so now al qaeda is the good guy and the elected government
[34:57.080 --> 35:00.520]  that's been somewhat pro-us it's been neutral
[35:00.520 --> 35:05.640]  is now the bad guy and then they flip to another guest saying you better give
[35:05.640 --> 35:09.800]  your rights up a u.s senator
[35:11.080 --> 35:17.880]  or we're going to be hit by terrorist iraq is just like this perpetual war
[35:17.880 --> 35:21.560]  zone after they removed saddam
[35:21.560 --> 35:25.960]  23 years ago they started the war against these people
[35:25.960 --> 35:30.760]  is a hundred years of war against iraq proper a thousand a million
[35:30.760 --> 35:36.280]  iraq never attacked us iraq was a somewhat of a secular nation that the
[35:36.280 --> 35:39.480]  cia under another policy put a stabilizer in
[35:39.480 --> 35:47.800]  saddam hussein that's declassified then they set him up
[35:47.800 --> 35:52.360]  told him to invade kawaii and then have been weakening the country ever since
[35:52.360 --> 35:55.160]  and now they're pouring into the country out of
[35:55.160 --> 36:01.560]  saudi arabia qatar the giant forces that were in
[36:01.560 --> 36:05.800]  syria for the three and a half years couldn't beat Assad
[36:05.800 --> 36:12.760]  now they're pouring into the totally infiltrated iraqi government with cia
[36:12.760 --> 36:21.080]  mi6 contractor spooks everywhere using that embassy to give battle data
[36:21.080 --> 36:30.280]  to al qaeda in its new comic book name isis or isis potato patata is is as they
[36:30.280 --> 36:35.160]  fly the bin laden and al qaeda flags bigger than dallas
[36:35.160 --> 36:39.000]  and as they murder every christian and every military and every police person
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.000]  they find these are police people and military people
[36:43.000 --> 36:51.000]  that were trained on record by our u.s military and incredible casualties
[36:51.000 --> 36:54.680]  to stabilize that country after it was destabilized by the west
[36:54.680 --> 37:00.920]  and now they're being killed and cnn fox and msnbc all
[37:00.920 --> 37:03.720]  are up there saying well the president of iraq
[37:03.720 --> 37:09.800]  should have just been more pro-west and should have done whatever we said and
[37:09.800 --> 37:14.840]  maybe now if he behaves we may give some airstrikes to stop al qaeda
[37:14.840 --> 37:25.960]  that has isis that has now surrounded baghdad
[37:25.960 --> 37:32.920]  this would be the equivalent of 200 000 jihadis that had infiltrated the u.s
[37:32.920 --> 37:37.640]  massing around dc attacking and murdering everyone they come across
[37:37.640 --> 37:41.320]  and the news goes on and says obama's been unpopular
[37:41.320 --> 37:44.760]  you know he deserves this i mean that's basically what cnn's saying
[37:44.760 --> 37:49.320]  and they try to make it about bush bush was a puppet
[37:49.320 --> 37:53.000]  bush was the earlier program to destabilize iraq and get it ready
[37:53.000 --> 37:57.480]  for saudi arabia who's been softening iraq up
[37:57.480 --> 38:05.320]  for 22 years where did 15 of the 19 hijackers come from

[44:04.520 --> 44:09.880]  england you name it to sterilize people but only a certain portion so that no
[44:09.880 --> 44:12.840]  one could tell it was the potato directly and they hit you from so many
[44:12.840 --> 44:16.120]  other angles they end up getting everybody
[44:16.120 --> 44:22.280]  guys i'm thinking we should call it like even though it's a parody we can get
[44:22.280 --> 44:25.640]  away with doing it we should call it something like like
[44:25.640 --> 44:29.240]  punkity sort of jeopardy you know we're a punk nation
[44:29.240 --> 44:34.440]  of slaves a little public anything so we'll call the show i got punk

[44:43.080 --> 44:46.600]  forced to bend over it'd be easier to stand up and fight but
[44:46.600 --> 44:50.280]  they want the hard road to be in a slave so to all the slaves out there

[45:03.480 --> 45:06.920]  everything like i was yesterday and then i just kind of rebound with the
[45:06.920 --> 45:11.080]  sarcasticness like i'm doing right now
[45:11.080 --> 45:15.160]  i bet all you fbi guys and secret service guys and military people
[45:15.160 --> 45:18.440]  i bet you think you're going to be real safe in this system where everybody
[45:18.440 --> 45:21.160]  gets backstabbed actually the military and police
[45:21.160 --> 45:24.120]  of people are waking up because they realize this is going to a really bad
[45:24.120 --> 45:26.360]  place i wonder what's happening to the general
[45:26.360 --> 45:30.040]  public though do they have any idea that it's admitted that obama
[45:30.040 --> 45:34.520]  ordered the attack on anybody who was pro-freedom with the irs that's totally
[45:34.520 --> 45:38.200]  beyond richard nixon times a thousand and that now they claim all the emails
[45:38.200 --> 45:42.360]  have been erased now that congress is forcing the subpoena iris loses emails
[45:42.360 --> 45:45.720]  from six more involved in targeting in different email
[45:45.720 --> 45:49.080]  systems and of course the head of the environmental
[45:49.080 --> 45:58.440]  grab she got caught in subpoenas lying about emails and had fake emails
[45:58.440 --> 46:01.400]  isn't that just sweet isn't that just cute ladies and gentlemen
[46:01.400 --> 46:05.640]  isn't that just special and the dollar is plunging in value price of meat
[46:05.640 --> 46:13.320]  chicken fish sores to all-time high on dollar devaluation and also they've
[46:13.320 --> 46:17.480]  rigged uh now by getting most of the food produced
[46:17.480 --> 46:21.160]  outside the country 50 years ago we could feed the whole world literally
[46:21.160 --> 46:24.920]  now they've scanned the markets the meat packing so much that they've set it up
[46:24.920 --> 46:28.040]  where you can't produce chicken turkey
[46:28.040 --> 46:32.760]  fish farm fish beef and and make a living in most cases it's not very
[46:32.760 --> 46:35.560]  profitable put it to you that way if you're an actual producer and
[46:35.560 --> 46:39.720]  unless you're a big agribusiness they're giving all the loopholes and tax exemptions
[46:39.720 --> 46:45.400]  and and all the taxpayer money a little guy didn't get all that
[46:45.400 --> 46:49.080]  the corporate welfare and so as most the ranchers shut down on the small
[46:49.080 --> 46:52.760]  chicken producers shut down is the i mean you're going to find out what it's
[46:52.760 --> 46:57.000]  like and i hope everybody enjoys it but on top of all of that i mean because
[46:57.000 --> 47:00.120]  you know we don't want that freeloader bundy whose family's been on that land
[47:00.120 --> 47:08.040]  since 1877 1878 uh six generations seven generations
[47:08.040 --> 47:10.840]  they've run out all the other 30 something ranching families that came
[47:10.840 --> 47:15.160]  there on wagon drains but don't worry he's shut and he'll shut down and then
[47:15.160 --> 47:20.520]  he'll show that lazy freeloader and then and then who can pay the taxes all the
[47:20.520 --> 47:26.280]  blm and the little army outfits who can't wait to have a war with the tea party
[47:26.280 --> 47:33.320]  mm-hmm they're also tough you know they're all big big big tough commandos
[47:33.320 --> 47:37.800]  by the way uh there's a video up on info wars.com
[47:37.800 --> 47:42.040]  and drubsreport.com is linked to the story from yesterday in the middle column
[47:42.040 --> 47:45.320]  churches caught shipping illegals into the country
[47:45.320 --> 47:48.520]  and you know i saw some of the trolls and the comments saying it wasn't true and
[47:48.520 --> 47:51.640]  stuff and our story got picked up by hundreds of other publications and i
[47:51.640 --> 47:55.240]  went look to some of those and the talking point is oh these are just kids
[47:55.240 --> 47:59.880]  that got off buses and teenagers and their moms and babies and so the
[47:59.880 --> 48:03.080]  church has waited the border to be nice no we went and found the church's
[48:03.080 --> 48:06.600]  public statements the catholic churches the evangelical churches all
[48:06.600 --> 48:11.240]  democratic party front grips 501c3 getting
[48:11.240 --> 48:16.280]  taxpayer money and getting ford foundation money in their own words
[48:16.280 --> 48:20.040]  to stage the illegals coming in and the border patrol being told to stand down
[48:20.040 --> 48:23.320]  and guess what the border patrol did they came over and got
[48:23.320 --> 48:27.240]  in our reporter's faces yesterday
[48:28.920 --> 48:34.040]  and so that's the big news and our guys shot a report about it
[48:34.040 --> 48:37.960]  so we've got them coming up in the third hour they're going to have that video
[48:37.960 --> 48:42.440]  jacari mentions it another report talking about more patrol powerless
[48:42.440 --> 48:46.360]  and that's interesting but but the headline
[48:46.760 --> 48:53.160]  is border patrol tries to stop press from reporting on collapse border
[48:53.160 --> 48:56.760]  because that's what happened i've talked to them
[48:56.760 --> 48:59.640]  but that's how nice reporters are oh really we're being harassed by the border
[48:59.640 --> 49:03.240]  patrol literally down there showing the illegals being let in
[49:03.240 --> 49:07.400]  of course the press is the enemy in something like this and i'm not trying
[49:07.400 --> 49:09.880]  to get into fight with the border patrol but you've got a bunch of political
[49:09.880 --> 49:13.400]  people on the border patrol now you know the the head of it and people are
[49:13.400 --> 49:17.320]  former ford foundation heads who swore to destroy this country and so they're
[49:17.320 --> 49:21.400]  following orders to change diapers heat up milk for the babies get them on the
[49:21.400 --> 49:24.920]  buses and get them deeper into the u.s where they promptly become
[49:24.920 --> 49:28.760]  citizens and obama i'm gonna cover this half the
[49:28.760 --> 49:33.000]  break is running around honoring illegal immigrant
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.440]  children this week that's to encourage them up here
[49:36.440 --> 49:40.120]  and then acting like oh we don't know why there's a flood and now that the words
[49:40.120 --> 49:44.040]  here that you get here everything's free i've got articles coming up i'll show
[49:44.040 --> 49:48.840]  you photos and mainstream news of like women with babies hanging off of them
[49:48.840 --> 49:52.280]  totally dependent i mean the country is being sunk
[49:52.280 --> 49:55.800]  i've studied military history folks but anybody could figure this out
[49:55.800 --> 49:59.960]  when they turn off half the power plants in the country as they're now doing
[49:59.960 --> 50:03.080]  they've shut a third up down they're shutting down the other two-thirds of
[50:03.080 --> 50:07.000]  that fifty percent they swore to do that's a military attack
[50:07.000 --> 50:11.960]  it'll cost money for everything else you do like meat that's exploding
[50:11.960 --> 50:16.040]  when they ship your jobs overseas with incentives where it's impossible to have
[50:16.040 --> 50:19.800]  a factory here in the u.s unless you're an insider that's called deindustrialization
[50:19.800 --> 50:22.520]  economic warfare when you ship in tens of millions of
[50:22.520 --> 50:25.000]  illegals to get freebies and to vote to take the rights of people
[50:25.000 --> 50:29.320]  that's a economic takeover this is a military takeover they use al-qaeda to
[50:29.320 --> 50:35.960]  take down iraq or take down libya or syria they use economic warfare on us
[50:35.960 --> 50:38.840]  and people that understand it can thrive in this environment but most people
[50:38.840 --> 50:42.200]  can't most people are caught flat-footed and they're

[54:38.440 --> 54:42.920]  everywhere which is the stated goal of the so-called leftists that run our
[54:42.920 --> 54:46.440]  government who aren't real leftists i know plenty of hippies
[54:46.440 --> 54:50.040]  plenty of folks that are into organic food that are wonderful great
[54:50.040 --> 54:53.480]  people you know they're buying milk from the amish and care about freedom and
[54:53.480 --> 54:56.840]  own guns there's like a hippie texan type that is
[54:56.840 --> 55:01.480]  great people but the globalist pose as trendy hippies
[55:01.480 --> 55:04.600]  and as quote you know progressive loving people
[55:04.600 --> 55:07.560]  when they are nothing but a group of social engineering
[55:07.560 --> 55:14.040]  tyrants who are a totally parasitic group now i want to get into all the

[55:26.200 --> 55:29.400]  so it's good to have an army out of saudi arabia that massed in
[55:29.400 --> 55:36.680]  controlled areas of jordan and syria come in and murder everybody
[55:36.680 --> 55:40.600]  and feride zarkaria was smiling he's so evil looking

[55:45.720 --> 55:52.760]  i saw he died i mean if i mean if some commando would have broken
[55:52.760 --> 55:55.800]  cut off his neck there's a military code with real killers
[55:55.800 --> 55:59.720]  that that they don't brag about it a it's bad luck
[55:59.720 --> 56:04.200]  b it's it's it's unseemly c you don't want folks coming after you
[56:04.200 --> 56:08.360]  because you've killed people d when you're a tough guy people know what other
[56:08.360 --> 56:12.200]  tough guys want to fight you i keep going on the list of why no one in
[56:12.200 --> 56:17.560]  history gets up on tv or in newspapers or in print or on a speech that says i
[56:17.560 --> 56:24.120]  killed qaddafi and it's some ugly crone evil woman who didn't do jack
[56:24.120 --> 56:28.600]  crap who lied about herself being in a aircraft shot up
[56:28.600 --> 56:32.680]  over syria remember that loadable they were sitting on
[56:32.680 --> 56:43.080]  flatjackets as they flew into the combat zone
[56:43.080 --> 56:46.520]  i've got a cousin who's been in the military 31 years but i asked him he's
[56:46.520 --> 56:50.280]  been over 20 combat turds he won't tell you anything
[56:50.280 --> 56:54.040]  no stories no nothing except about people burning up their own kids and
[56:54.040 --> 56:57.560]  stuff and why he hates why he hates al-qaeda type people
[56:57.560 --> 57:03.000]  so much and then meanwhile you got hillary clinton talking about how tough

[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:55.480]  on isis isis that is an al-qaeda saudi arabian military
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:58.360]  that's admitted they've got heat-seeking missiles
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.040]  stinger missiles given to them by the globalist by the cia
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:06.760]  by british intelligence by tarkish intelligence by saudi arabian operations
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.480]  to destabilize the whole area and they're now saying they got to take our
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:14.360]  rights on the news america will be hit by isis
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.920]  and the neocons are all very proud of themselves knowing how stupid the
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:20.280]  public is going see we've got to take your rights now
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:25.480]  when they run the army doing this and it doesn't mean this army won't kill us
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:29.880]  soldiers of course it's like in braveheart which is based on a
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:33.720]  true story those battles really happen where long shanks the king says fire
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:37.320]  with archers into the whole army fighting he goes sir but there's a battle
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:42.360]  we'll kill our people he goes we'll get some of theirs too
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:47.640]  it isn't about it's about getting everybody so here's jacari jackson's
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.800]  report and the bar patrol following around the
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:59.400]  harassed him so doing something about the illegals here it is
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:02.600]  this is jacari jackson for info wars dot com we're on the texas
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:06.600]  mexico border investigating what could be considered an invasion of the united
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.160]  states of america by central american immigrants
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:12.600]  you say well maybe invasion is too strong of a word well let's take a look
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.880]  at some of these words from the border patrol agents themselves we have this
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:19.640]  article x border patrol agents immigrant flood orchestrated
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:23.240]  and in this article these border patrol agents they're talking about how this is
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:26.680]  a very intentional thing done by the obama administration
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:31.000]  praying on the well-meaning good wishes of the american people
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.440]  because you have church groups and other people that pick up these people at the
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.160]  bus stations they give them a hot bath they give them a
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:40.680]  a hot meal then loose them back onto the streets of america
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:43.960]  but you have to consider that many of the people that are coming here this has
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:47.960]  been reported in breitbart are gang affiliated these are people sometimes
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:51.480]  who have diseases and they're coming here to the united states of america
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:55.400]  not as if we don't have our own health concerns and also safety risk
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:59.480]  with the gangs we already have here in the states and the thing that concerns
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:02.600]  me about this is because we see border patrol agents
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:06.040]  and they're concerned about what we're doing as journalists not concerned so
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.640]  much about what the illegal immigrants are doing and i'm saying to these guys
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:12.680]  you know if you really want to catch these illegal immigrants why are you out
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:15.320]  here worrying about what we're doing why don't you go to some of these army
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:18.040]  bases some of these other facilities that are housing these people
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:21.640]  illegally we see for example back in 2009
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:25.880]  a california county spent 64 million providing welfare assistance
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:30.600]  to these illegal immigrants so this is very much a financial concern not just
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:34.680]  the safety risk of gangs or the health risk of the diseases but now you have
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:37.320]  another concern as well so this is something that we've been
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:40.520]  documenting for a while now as you recall last week
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:44.200]  kit daniels and also staff sergeant joe biggs they were investigating
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:48.280]  why military bases are in on this action because we have military veterans
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:52.120]  who are homeless who cannot receive health care at the va or get the things
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:55.080]  that they need at the va and now we're bringing in other people
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:58.840]  when we can't even fulfill the needs of the people right here in our own country
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:02.200]  so stay tuned to info wars dot com prisonplanet.tv
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:05.080]  for more reports and we'll be bringing you more from the border here in south

[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:17.240]  i've been saying to you coming to you from occupied femur regent six for about
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:23.000]  18 years it's directly out of red dawn
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.240]  for all of those on or behind the lines this song is for you
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:30.440]  and then they had an old promo on genesis about 18 years ago
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:33.960]  we ought to find that where it then came in with the music and and
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:37.720]  my voice so that's why we have those liners the last decade or so that one
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:42.520]  you just heard where we say from deep behind enemy lines
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:46.520]  we are in occupied femur region six new world order corporate

[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:04.920]  so that we'll be pliably incrementally reduced as the age of the machines rises
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:08.520]  towards the age of the transhumanist in their own words in
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:13.320]  quadruplicate and they're following their plan
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:16.920]  how do i know what they're going to do next they think you're so stupid
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:20.920]  they've they've admitted their whole plan i remember three years ago the
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:25.480]  headline in council on foreign relations why we need al-qaeda
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:28.760]  and how they're great fighters doing a great job against the sod and how they
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:31.960]  can use them all over the middle east
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:36.760]  and just because they could sit back and go you know we use al-qaeda to make
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:40.760]  states be pliant for the greater good for america
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:45.160]  think about how evil that is we'll make a sod or iraq or anybody behave
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:48.600]  by bringing al-qaeda in
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:54.200]  now there's the headline cfr strategist praises al-qaeda bombings in syria
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:57.400]  and that's an info wars dot com article with a direct link to the council on
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:00.440]  foreign relations white paper
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:06.840]  and again it was 2012 so that was two two and a half years ago the point is
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:11.640]  then we have hillary clinton welcoming it in a clip
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:15.800]  and that's because they know the general public doesn't know the difference
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:22.120]  between al-qaeda and shia suni versus shia
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:25.800]  they don't know anything so they're doomed the people perish for lack of
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:29.240]  knowledge jesus christ said that
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:36.360]  and it's very frustrating to know the players to know the plan to see it going
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:39.080]  on and then to now because they can't hide it watch
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.880]  seeing it in i watched it last night this morning just going
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:48.280]  yeah you know maybe al-qaeda's got a point or isis they don't call it al-qaeda
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:52.200]  isis when it's al-qaeda the black flag saw the arabia
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:58.280]  i mean it's al-qaeda's daddy it's worse than al-qaeda in fact there's even
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:00.840]  articles going well this group is worse than al-qaeda
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:08.760]  but they're good and then when i fly they want me to go to naked body scanner
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:14.360]  and they want to grab my genitals all to train me publicly to be a slave
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:17.880]  it has nothing to do with any of this and now
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:21.320]  and i'm going to your phone calls we told you this a hundred times if we told
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:26.600]  you once for three years before banghazi happened i said they're
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:31.000]  going to give stinger missiles to al-qaeda and to a hobbyist
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.800]  and because that gives the west plausible liability
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:37.880]  Saudi arabia has their agents give it to their agents give it to their jihad
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:43.000]  armies with 10 levels of separation they then are allowed into the united
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.200]  states just like 15 of the 19 reported hijackers i've
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:50.200]  had the former head of the embassy visa section springman
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:53.400]  on the show repeatedly he's been in mainstream news
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:56.760]  saying we said you guys are al-qaeda terrorists and the cia
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:00.680]  called them up and said national security their terror designation is a
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:04.440]  cover they are cia agents not operatives
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:08.360]  agents Muhammad adda and others were trained at us military bases
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:11.880]  that's mainstream news remember it came out with the head of the
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:15.320]  defense language school went four of the hijackers were trained in my class for
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:18.280]  a year those guys on the news i know them
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:21.720]  i've had lunch with them
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:27.080]  alex jones is a trader that says the police blew up the world trade centers
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:32.120]  i never said that yeah the firefighters did it and new yorkers did it he says
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:36.200]  he says it's an inside job and bush had a plunger like wiley coyote that's
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:41.000]  that's a quote chris matthews no i said sonny arabia has got
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.880]  cheap gift commandos they call them al-qaeda who will kill themselves attacking
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:49.720]  this country in order to do so and then our government gets to take all of our
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:53.880]  rights away it's two plus two equals four it is a simple equation
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:57.880]  where are the apologies from sean hanity
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:04.520]  from glenn beck from all of them zero apologies the only person
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:07.560]  i guess who's a professor and got like four degrees and the best-selling
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:11.240]  author so i guess he is dr savage savage has always pointed out that the
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:14.200]  west is funding al-qaeda and letting him attack
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:17.640]  and he talks about false flag because anyone who's informed
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:22.360]  says that two people talk about false flags alex jones michael savage
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:25.560]  believe me all the others know all about it ladies and gentlemen they just
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:30.440]  won't tell you about it they go alex says there's no muslim extremist
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:35.560]  and he wants to be with the jihadis no no no no no no no no it's the opposite
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:38.280]  i'm saying don't arm them i'm saying they are a threat
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:42.120]  i'm saying it's a threat to take my liberties
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:45.640]  and you have trillions of dollars every few years and no bid contracts to
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:49.080]  consolidate control in this country militarize the police and i told you
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:52.920]  over a decade ago they would then flip when they prepare the revolution against
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:56.520]  the american people homeland security from al-qaeda
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:01.720]  onto the liberty movement the patriot's which they call the tea party now
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:07.640]  and it all happened because it's simple geopolitical three-dimensional chess
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:11.640]  strategy i know the gambits i know the stratagems
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:16.360]  i know the entire enemy program in a 3d map in my mind that god gave me
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:20.360]  just like you would have it if you studied all players listen adult men
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:24.920]  have fantasy football they know where some football player went to high school
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:28.280]  they know the guy's wife's name they know all the baseball scores
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:31.160]  they can go and tell you what play a coach is about to play
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:36.200]  i've seen it with friends of mine before that team goes oh my gosh watch this
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:38.840]  the cowboys are going to do this or the 40 dollars are going to do this or the
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:42.040]  cardinals are going to do this and you watch and they do it and i go my god
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:46.600]  if you just use that brain and business or life just if you just use that for
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:51.080]  real stuff see
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:56.440]  they've got all these adults with fake synthetic artificial reality artificial
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:58.600]  consciousness lives where they pay money to get a
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:02.840]  Lamborghini in a fictional world hundreds of dollars
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:06.360]  where you pay to get a supermodel girlfriend
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:11.160]  show you're at home and and never really compete in the world
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:16.760]  they got all these complex board games that are fine if you play them once a
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:20.920]  month i play some of my kids action adventure games you know space games
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:23.960]  it's like dungeons and dragons but it's like sci-fi or whatever you know so it's
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:28.920]  not a cultic star trek games star wars games but to really get into it you
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:32.280]  got to learn all the players and it's complex and your brain's designed that
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:34.920]  if you get into something with strategy you start liking it but i go wait a
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:42.120]  minute i don't want to waste eight hours playing this game
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:45.480]  see because that takes up all my synapses all my connections
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:49.160]  to a war game reality and what i'm saying is so incredibly simple
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:53.240]  that's the thing it's not my opinion you don't have to believe me
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:56.760]  you can go out and verify that they put hydrofluorosalic acid
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:04.680]  aka electrified ionized you're supercharged
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:07.800]  chemical warfare in your water they brag they're doing it to brain damage you
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:10.440]  and your family they brag they're putting
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:13.080]  cancer viruses in the vaccines they're time released
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:16.680]  they brag on every front i'm telling you it's
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:23.160]  public it's public it's public the average lawyer the average police
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:26.920]  officer even the average social worker the average person in the bureaucracy is
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:30.600]  not bad but they're compartmentalized in their
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:33.720]  little niche following the niche program they get
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:37.080]  from the publications and things they follow and they don't have full spectrum
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:40.360]  analysis of the larger system outside the dome
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:44.120]  it's like thx 1138 with robert duvall
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:48.600]  directed by the great and he was great in his
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:56.040]  earlier films towards lucas and in thx 1138 a remake of his college
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:01.800]  film his college graduation film robert duvall breaks through to the surface

[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:53.800]  most the cops don't know about this because it's all being used

[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:32.600]  but right now let's go to marcos in california you're on the air thanks for
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:36.440]  calling i'm doing alec i'm all right brother
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:39.400]  pretty good well i just wanted to know your thoughts on the idea that the
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:44.120]  catholic church created islam by former jezzer priest alberto ribera
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:48.120]  and his claims that that's happening the globalists are still using that
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:52.360]  for their objectives if you look at the catholic church's symbol i h
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:56.920]  s i support or said i mean you we're still seeing ices pop up i just like to
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:00.520]  know your thoughts on that well you know i'm not a catholic but i've
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:02.920]  studied a lot of the history of it and i've said the catholic church was
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:06.520]  behind promoting the european union uh so the catholic church
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:10.200]  politically is involved in a bunch of stuff i don't agree with
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:14.040]  and you're promoting socialism now and it's a big deal
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:17.560]  catholic church isn't supposed to have a jezz you would ever run it that's now
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:21.320]  happening so a lot of stuff's going on that said i don't sit
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:23.800]  there and see the catholics as one monolithic group there's a lot of
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:27.080]  diverse ideas a lot of conservative catholics out there
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:31.560]  i'm familiar with that particular catholic priest you're talking about
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:36.120]  because schizophrenic people that are always claiming that i am a catholic
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:41.320]  vatican operative with zero proof because it makes them feel big to
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:44.760]  bear false witness against people are always claiming all this stuff about
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:49.240]  this guy uh and i think it's asinine knowing history
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:53.800]  to say that the catholic church founded islam
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:57.640]  uh when islam almost drove out the catholic church and went as far north
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:03.240]  as areas of germany and poland and invaded italy invaded spain
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:06.360]  and the catholic church drove them out in the crusades
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:10.680]  and barely survived so you could say what you want about the catholic church
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:14.440]  the catholic church in the west the orthodox some in the east mainly the
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:18.200]  catholic church count dracula the whole nine yards
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:24.280]  literally stopped uh the muslim invaders at at places like kosovo and you name
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:28.760]  it so uh the guy you're talking about was a
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:31.240]  seventh day adventist i don't think it's seven day adventist
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:33.880]  my mom even worked for seven day adventist when i was a little kid as one of
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:37.160]  their secretaries one of the big guys at a tv show in dallas
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:41.160]  uh but but i mean seven day adventist sub break off groups
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:44.520]  make stuff up and lie about anyone that doesn't agree with them and say that
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:48.200]  they're vatican assassins uh and so there is your answer
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:51.960]  uh to that whole subject of claiming that the catholic church
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:58.920]  uh is behind islam mohammed is behind islam and the fact that his religion
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:03.160]  that he founded that that then took in areas of christianity and
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:10.200]  judaism into it was at a key crossroads of of the uh silk trade
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:13.320]  and of the caravans and made people pay a tribute
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:16.440]  they didn't pay an attribute for a thousand years before that at least
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:22.040]  at mecca but when he took the key city of mecca it was like taking new york city
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:25.640]  so that's why islam is is dominant is because they
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:30.120]  took over the key city of mecca geopolitically now it's not as fun as
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:33.720]  saying you know that uh you know the vatican uh
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:37.480]  runs everything it's not as easy intellectually to actually know history
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:42.760]  uh but there's your answer you said to answer your question
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:47.160]  yes thank you alec thank you i appreciate it uh yeah i mean if if the
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:50.760]  anti-catholics want to get people on their bandwagon they should try not
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:53.240]  running around you know like denouncing everyone
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:57.960]  as witches basically uh you know and just saying horrible litigious things

[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:38.280]  battle that's right the main reason we went
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:41.880]  into iraq at the time was we thought he had weapons of mass destruction it
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:44.920]  turns out he didn't but he had the capacity to make weapons of mass
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:48.360]  but i also talked about the human suffering in iraq
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:52.520]  hello boys and girls i have a special message for you from the president of
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:55.960]  the united states i salute the boys and girls who are buying
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:58.920]  united states saving stamps and bonds and they're giving
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:03.560]  important support to the cause of freedom and the men who fight for us
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:07.640]  in vietnam the congress gave us this authority
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:11.560]  in august 1964
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:16.680]  to do whatever may be necessary that's pretty far reaching
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:20.760]  that's the sky is the limit as an american citizen you have to respect our
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:24.360]  president whether i like it or not it's really not not my decision
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:28.840]  but i do respect my president and i will support whatever decision he makes
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:36.120]  music played on people's side just for me
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:40.760]  the church bells rang
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:48.520]  it is a hard fact that u.s strikes have resulted in civilian casualties
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:58.440]  now he's gone i don't know why until this day sometimes i cry
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:02.520]  he didn't even say goodbye he didn't take the time
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:08.520]  to lie the united states knows that iraq has weapons of mass destruction
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:11.960]  well the first thing they told me was you're not even to acknowledge the
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:15.800]  drone program you're not even to discuss that it exists
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:21.640]  renewed hostile actions against united states ships on the high seas and the
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:27.400]  gulf of pumpkin have today required me to order the
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:31.160]  military forces of the united states to take action
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:37.480]  and reply that reply is crashing through the lies and
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:44.360]  disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:48.840]  waging war on corruption
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:51.880]  we're at the halfway point in the global transmission we're going to the border
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:55.480]  with breaking news coming up at the start of the next hour about 15 in
[01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:58.360]  i'm going to go right back to your calls right now but since the caller
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:02.200]  mentioned it alan we do have it here on the stack document can please

[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:19.800]  and i told you three months ago when they started taking fallujah
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:22.680]  they would end up taking at least half the country and we're being armed
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:27.160]  by the criminals that run our government so world that daily's doing a good job
[01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:30.680]  with their incredible israeli and jordanian
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:34.280]  sources i mean they did break that odinga obama's cousin was fencing the
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:37.240]  money by the millions in to the muslim brotherhood to overthrow
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:43.800]  egypt that came out in court but it's not blowback
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:47.960]  our military trained these al-qaeda forces gave them the weapons

[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:56.200]  does and british command does all those bases are over in
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:00.600]  turkey even more over in turkey that's why we launched the fake chemical attacks
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:03.640]  on Assad i'm not romanticizing Assad he didn't do anything
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:08.360]  he didn't attack anybody he was democratizing
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:11.240]  and then our government doesn't want them having a nice place where you want
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:14.120]  to go visit and go to their great beaches and go scuba diving or go see the
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:18.520]  ancient roman and greek ruins they're better roman ruins folks in

[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:26.120]  five ten years ago that could have chosen a place to go it had been syria
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:30.520]  i've read the travel journals it's incredible we're talking three thousand
[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:33.720]  year old open air markets that are like you can't believe
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:39.880]  and they're clean and safe not anymore they aren't they've all been blown up

[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:15.480]  that i'm a suspect i'm a terrorist according to homeland security because
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:18.200]  i'm pro-freedom and then the government runs al-qaeda
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:22.280]  and the tsa's too stupid the fbi's too dumb the public doesn't know what's what
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:25.960]  end is up here it is i'm going to your calls blowback us
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:33.080]  trained is is secret jordan base members of the islamic state of iraq
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:38.600]  and the levant of the isis were trained in 2012 by us instructors working at a
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:43.000]  secret base in jordan you know i've had military on about that base
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.800]  because they would joke to them in english we're going to kill you after we're
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:48.920]  done in syria and iraq and so there were fights and
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:52.200]  stuff breaking out it was kind of a rebellion that hadn't been reported on
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:55.160]  yet you've heard it here years ago but it will come out someday
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:58.360]  that uh there was even reportedly a little more happened and
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:03.400]  that the military refused to train them after a while
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:08.280]  mainly because this show and this is on record in the british news
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:13.720]  this show pointed it out a sod pointed it out mi6 hacked the sod's emails it was
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:18.520]  talking about me and info wars and how they were going off my analysis in the
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:22.920]  syrian government for their propaganda well it isn't propaganda it's the truth
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:25.800]  by the way if you just joined us look at the london independent london guardian
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:30.520]  google info wars dot com a sod emails click
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:33.720]  click web and you'll get the news articles in england
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:38.120]  where this was going on so we exposed it with our military sources
[01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:42.360]  a sod picked it up put it out that why are you aiding al qaeda then
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:46.840]  the rest of the media picked it up ted cruz picked it up ran paul picked it up
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:52.440]  and then it was over no more public backing of these people
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:56.840]  so that's the power of info wars dot com and prison planet dot com but here it
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:01.960]  is members of the islamic state of iraq the is is
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:06.520]  were trained by us military the official said dozens of is
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:10.840]  is members were trained about thousands at at the time as part of a covert aid to
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:13.640]  insurgents targeting the regime of syrian president
[01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:17.000]  bashera's al-sad in syria the official said the training
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.400]  was not meant to be used for any future campaign iraq you know right
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:24.680]  that's what they did the base right on the border with iraq the georgianian
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:28.600]  officials said the is is members who receive us training to fight in syria
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:33.080]  were first vetted for any links to extremist groups like al qaeda
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:37.240]  oh that that's a good one now here's another one us aid spawning new breed

[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:32.680]  paper in england uh 75 cargo plane loads started
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:36.600]  moving uh through that airport the exact same airport hillary
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:39.800]  visited those weapons were coming from kawesha
[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:44.120]  and they were going through turkey and through jordan and right to the border
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:49.000]  and then they were trucked over the border into syria the same mo
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:53.320]  oh no that's all on record they they actually had al-qaeda bases in iraq
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:57.800]  and then maliki would attack them in our media would call him a devil
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:01.880]  for suppressing his loving citizens i mean if you turn on singing in right now
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:05.400]  they're saying every hour because i've watched it two hours off and on this
[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:09.320]  morning and last night they're saying well the president of iraq asked for
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:12.840]  he's a bad guy and then no wonder they're going
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:16.680]  well we don't we don't want to do anything to al-qaeda i mean
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:20.680]  why do you think they can get away with this it's so obvious
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:24.200]  the question is are the troops gonna wake up remember
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:28.600]  when they started saying i don't want to be part of the al-qaeda air force
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:32.840]  where's this gonna go now now that he's sending uh spec ops
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:39.080]  into iraq what are the troops they're in the middle
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:42.040]  it's incredible brother it's totally incredible god bless you i appreciate
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:44.520]  your call by the way the guys had put it on screen i hadn't seen it

[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:51.800]  and then click that and it brings up mainstream news
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:55.560]  where asad was going off info wars dot com
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:58.200]  i never really bragged about it at the time because it's not something you brag
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:04.120]  about uh but um that's the type of um
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:06.840]  stuff that um
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:11.880]  type of stuff that comes out because we really know what's going on
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:15.400]  and the russian government listens to us i had the number three guy at the time
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:25.880]  from the japanese government on
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:30.120]  all right let's go right back to your calls let's talk to rich in or again rich
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:34.120]  thanks for holding her on the air that's a pleasure to talk to you again
[01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:39.640]  alex johnson talk to you hey i was uh gotta tell you
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:44.600]  i started watching jesse venture about 2010 i believe this show was conspiracy
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:47.880]  theory yes and um i didn't even know how i got
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:51.640]  hooked up with yours but i was pretty skeptical of you in the beginning
[01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:55.400]  and over the last i would say year and a half
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:59.160]  i've actually gotten my eyes open more and more
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:02.840]  and i actually became a supporter info wars you know i mean
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:10.120]  so i seen this thing with kate uh megan kelly was that last night i guess i was
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:14.440]  about talking about what you said i want to say it's been a couple years ago
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:17.560]  we're being guysy let me ask you a question how many times because we're
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:21.000]  we're not able to find a clip to needle in the haystack how many hundreds of
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.360]  times or how many times have you heard me or have you not heard me
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:27.960]  say they'll give the cruise the the stinger missiles al-qaeda then they'll
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:30.680]  say they're going to shoot down our airliners and then they're going to attack
[01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:34.600]  america we've got to take your rights oh yeah i've heard you say it a lot of
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:36.920]  times but you know a lot of game that goes back to being a little
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:39.960]  skeptic so i started research on myself you know what i mean
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:43.160]  and and you can find all kinds of things on the internet and
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:45.880]  believe it or not i mean you it's kind of your choice
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:50.360]  but when you're backing up stuff with uh documents and proof
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:55.320]  that's that's why i thought that uh i don't know if you got a crystal ball
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:59.240]  or you just got real good intel but you're on the money and i gotta tell
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:02.920]  you i the only way i know how to fix anything like this
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:08.280]  is to break the back of the beast is not to give it the money
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:12.360]  you know i don't know how to exactly do that i guess like with paying taxes
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:16.440]  didn't allow me to drill for that however
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:19.880]  there's gotta be a way i mean i don't like my money going over they're killing
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:23.800]  all those people and and given the enemy al-qaeda
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:31.480]  or whatever they're going by these days uh stuff that we bought for them
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:35.960]  and then they go oh gee weapons they got they're using them on iraq
[01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:39.880]  oh but the leader of iraq deserves it i mean they're not even
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:43.640]  covering it up anymore that's the disdain they have for us god bless you great
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:45.960]  points
[01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:50.600]  and then there's this argument well iran's backing the other side iran's not
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:53.880]  attacking anybody right now iran's trying to do peace deals
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:58.200]  whoever offensively starts the wars is in the wrong
[01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:03.000]  but it's just like we attacked iraq for 9 11 if we get attacked with a new 9 11
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:06.600]  will we attack england
[01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:10.760]  the enemy of saudi arabia
[01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:13.880]  shiai iraq
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:21.080]  got attacked by the united states when supposedly saudi arabia attacked us
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:27.160]  with proof see 2 plus 2 doesn't equal a thousand like they say
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:31.240]  2 plus 2 says saudi arabia is deep involved in all this and of course they
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:35.800]  are and it's now admitted they're behind the is is army
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:39.480]  that's an army that's not just a group of terrorists throwing
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:44.600]  hangar names that popped up out of a jack in the box somewhere
[01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:51.320]  and this is their plan to ruin iraq when the globalists get control of a
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:54.920]  country folks they wreck it look at what they're doing to america with the
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:58.440]  borders and the jobs and
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:03.560]  very frustrating very front and also saudi arabia wants to
[01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:06.920]  export all its jihadis out of their country
[01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:10.600]  because al-qaeda is so horrible folks there sometimes trying to bomb their own
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:13.000]  papa
[01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:16.920]  king sad
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:21.800]  let's go to the meg and kelly clip in case you just joined us again
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:25.320]  and it's on all the channels we have a bunch of these clips saying get ready
[01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:29.640]  here come the stinger missiles and i couldn't believe it this morning and i
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:33.480]  tried to get video of it on my iphone but it ended i was watching cnn
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:36.840]  and they said undoubtedly we've got to come up with measures to stop these
[01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:40.440]  stinger missiles for being used you know to shoot down our planes and the
[01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:44.360]  ladies like what do we do and then the other
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:48.200]  commentator goes yes what do we do to the security analysts they go
[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:51.240]  we may have to put security at perimeters around the airport see i
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:54.280]  just envisioned it'll be five miles away from the airport they'll just have
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:57.400]  checkpoint to look for stinger missiles because they gave al-qaeda
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:47:59.880]  stinger missiles no one will debate that or discuss that
[01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:04.120]  it's just now checkpoints everywhere constitution free zones not just
[01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:06.920]  near the border but anywhere in america because
[01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:10.440]  oh there might be a stinger missile no no stinger missiles under here
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:15.560]  none under there if you want to conquer a country how do the globalists want to
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:18.760]  conquer the country do they openly come out and attack
[01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:22.440]  americans no no no they protect us by taking our rights
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:27.400]  and surveilling us and setting up checkpoints to fight al-qaeda
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:30.760]  but then admitting homeland security is really training to fight who
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:33.960]  the american people
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:38.440]  76 percent of the american people live within 100 miles of the border of the
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:42.120]  coast and within 100 miles there is no constitution
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:47.080]  according to homeland security they call it constitution free zones
[01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:52.280]  and now anyone near an airport within five watch i mean i know how they operate
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:55.880]  and then when al-qaeda hits a train station then see
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:58.920]  oh somebody shot up a school now the schools are present
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:03.640]  see to protect it of course
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:08.920]  let's go ahead and go to meghan kelly about the stinger missiles
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:12.280]  not only are we getting new reports that this group may have executed
[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:17.720]  as many as 1700 iraqi security forces in recent days including in a massacre
[01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:22.360]  that that they put online and bragged about but today we learned that the same
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:24.520]  group may now be in possession of a deadly
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:28.280]  cache of american-made firepower stinger missiles
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:33.480]  they are powerful enough to take down a commercial airliner
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:36.600]  meanwhile our reporters are down at the border and about to file a bunch of
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:39.080]  reports
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:44.040]  where the border patrol messes with them when they're

[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:17.400]  this article just went live at info wars dot com border patrol investigates
[01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:20.840]  reporters but not front of illegals
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:23.400]  yeah next we're going to send our reporters to these bus stations right
[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:27.640]  over the border where the illegals disgorge and then get right on buses
[01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:31.240]  from catholic churches Protestant churches evangelicals they're all in on
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:34.200]  it and then they just bust them in to be given their
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:39.000]  voter ID cards i guess that story and video is up on info wars dot com
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:42.680]  and prison planet dot com and and this stuff is so outrageous
[01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:47.880]  that if we just call expose it it will boomerang back on the establishment
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:53.160]  there's a good chance that that we can turn this around this is desperation
[01:54:53.160 --> 01:54:56.680]  by the political class doing this
[01:54:57.960 --> 01:55:03.080]  jerry in georgia thanks for holding your on the air then Todd
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:06.760]  hi alex um i just wanted to say that this whole situation should
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:10.440]  should be portrayed as obama's pearl harbor
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:15.320]  he is this is either the biggest failure of the intelligence community in his
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:20.440]  administration or he chose to look the other way as an army of a thousand
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:24.200]  vehicles and thousands of men was amassed
[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:29.560]  so which is it you're talking about the isis is the illegal alien takeover
[01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:34.760]  is is is a giant army politically and what's happening in iraq
[01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:39.240]  and what's happening with george soros bragging he backed the overthrow in
[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:43.320]  ukraine with literal right wing nazis taking over and killing people
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:47.000]  notice they're moving on all fronts that's when you know all hell's going to
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.640]  break loose brother this is only the beginning
[01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:53.640]  do you i mean do you see what's happening a global destabilization program
[01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:58.280]  right as the food prices are set to double hyperinflation brother can you
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:01.240]  imagine the hell that's about to break loose
[01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:05.160]  oh absolutely but the way to get this people to understand
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:09.880]  is to ask the simple question i mean did the entire intelligence community the
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:13.000]  satellites the predators the global hawks all this
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:18.280]  miss an army or did obama ignore his daily morning folder of
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:22.120]  intelligence and decide to overlook an army being masked
[01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:26.360]  outside iraq one of the two it's it's a simple one or two
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:31.480]  which was it because last week all i heard was three obsolete tanks from russia
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:36.200]  went to ukraine so they can't miss three tanks but they somehow miss
[01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:40.520]  8 000 men and a thousand vehicles so they don't they don't miss a few hundred
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:45.640]  russian troops infiltrating to be observers in eastern ukraine and they
[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:48.440]  know all about that in their names but they didn't know
[01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:52.840]  tens of thousands of men from multiple angles now hundreds of thousands
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:56.040]  loading up in armored vehicles with weapons pouring in they do nothing
[01:56:56.040 --> 01:57:00.120]  about it listen blowback us trained is is at secret
[01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:03.240]  jordan base we told people this years ago folks this
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:09.960]  was planned but well if we if we put the pressure on
[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:13.400]  you're going to have somebody hopefully from the intelligence community coming
[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:16.120]  out and saying no no no we did our job
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:20.600]  we told the president he was briefed he ignored it
[01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:24.280]  i totally agree with you and there's no debating it but then the emails will
[01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:27.800]  just appear like with irs gauge see that's the thing
[01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:30.920]  if the current power structure doesn't get in trouble for this the sky's the
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:37.080]  limit i mean they can do anything with black al-qaeda
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:40.280]  flags that say al-qaeda on them they're invading
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:44.360]  and our media is going well the iraqi government deserves it
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:48.680]  it's outrageous we're going to go to break come back and talk to todd
[01:57:48.680 --> 01:57:53.880]  and then uh kevin mary christ and others then we'll get to our reporters

[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:33.400]  um i was kind of uh listening to you yesterday and you were talking
[02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:36.520]  about the illegal aliens in the church helping about
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:40.360]  and while you were soon as you said that i was like wow
[02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:44.280]  and it flashed me back to uh Denver international airport
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:48.680]  and if you look at the murals there's a bombed out church
[02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:53.160]  on one side a bunch of dead hispanic children laying in a ditch
[02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:56.360]  and their mother's crying over them i was just wondering
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:03:00.760]  are they going to use i know they love to use children for false flags
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:04.520]  could they could they be going down the same road oh yeah
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:07.720]  that they've actually removed that mural i've been told or moved to another
[02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:10.040]  area the airport where it's not seen as much
[02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:14.600]  uh it's definitely very illuminatiacultic and
[02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:18.520]  a lot has been made uh you know of it uh and we're showing one panel of it it's
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:21.960]  got a bunch of panels but it's definitely i forget who the artist is
[02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:24.680]  but it's it's basically a bunch of larica and quista stuff
[02:03:24.680 --> 02:03:29.000]  so that i mean that's exactly what it is and you know my whole issue is i don't
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:32.120]  reject spanish culture or any of it that's a big part of the west
[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:37.800]  i don't like the artificial leftist globalist stuff they force feed
[02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:43.640]  uh and this weird thing about how the mixture of the european and the
[02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:47.320]  native is going to create the god race and all this stuff i mean i've got video

[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:13.320]  that's pretty dangerous because that is a failed state over there most dangerous
[02:09:13.320 --> 02:09:17.000]  in the world listed by the state department in that particular border
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.960]  area that you're in most dangerous in the world
[02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:23.400]  uh but again if we criticize the illegals collapsing our border
[02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:26.680]  and running from that we're bad if we criticize everybody coming here and
[02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:31.080]  getting all these free goodies we're bad but but that's a mission you can
[02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:34.760]  take if you choose to accept it now you got a other big fish to fry

[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:52.440]  facility and we're not enemies of the border patrol
[02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:56.200]  the they've been had their manpower cut way back to deal with the
[02:09:56.200 --> 02:10:00.040]  legals they've been given the job of the heating formula changing diapers
[02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:03.560]  we see the buses at that facility pulling in the people aren't even checked
[02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:07.480]  there's so many they're then put on uh white vans drudgereport.com linked to
[02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:11.240]  the story yesterday it went viral we have new videos with the churches
[02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:14.520]  admitting their illegals that they are protecting them we have another
[02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:20.120]  article on info wars.com proving uh then indeed this is a
[02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:24.600]  obama administration program with the churches in an act of human trafficking
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:28.040]  and treason if i got caught shipping illegals in a van
[02:10:28.040 --> 02:10:32.360]  it's a felony but the churches are doing it in plain view
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:35.240]  to bring this country down ladies and gentlemen and complete
[02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:39.720]  their total socialist takeover and joining us again our john bandon jacari

[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:55.160]  prison planet dot tv but this is important what's about to happen
[02:10:55.160 --> 02:10:59.320]  gentlemen you've got the floor tell us about the ice agent that don was able
[02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:03.400]  to interview uh we're gonna not air the video till we blur out his face and
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:07.160]  alter his voice uh on the nightly news tonight or tomorrow tell us what else
[02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:10.280]  that happens as we talked to you yesterday and then let's go over there
[02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:15.800]  uh to the border patrol facility uh where they're basically on stand down
[02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:19.720]  yes alex we're here at the border crossing in brownsville texas now as you
[02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:22.520]  alluded to we just had a exclusive interview with an ice
[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:26.120]  agent he wants to remain anonymous and rightfully so we've seen the gag orders
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:29.640]  come down so he's trying to protect his identity but we were talking to him and
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:32.600]  I asked him a few questions you know about what's going on in this country how
[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:36.200]  people feel about it in the ranks and he says morale is pretty low
[02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:39.560]  in ice and border patrol they hate the fact that they're pretty much out here
[02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:43.160]  as window dressing they come out here supposedly to protect the border but
[02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:46.360]  they're being told to let all these people go he told me that one of the big
[02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:49.240]  reasons they let people go is because they just don't have enough beds
[02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:52.280]  in these facilities he said uh particularly women and children are
[02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:54.280]  often let go even though they may be caught
[02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:58.040]  at the border so those are some of the two big things we only give too much away
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:02.120]  at this moment but those are some of the larger points that he pointed out to us
[02:12:02.120 --> 02:12:06.600]  incredible jacari uh but I think this is breaking now in case they even try to
[02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:09.640]  get the tapes go ahead and tell us what else he said
[02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:13.160]  and then we'll see the video itself later yeah so he was telling us some of
[02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:16.360]  the hot spots to come and see on the border you know he
[02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:18.840]  said you know go a few miles this way actually don't give that away you're
[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:21.880]  right you're right I thought others no no don't tell folks where we're going
[02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:26.120]  tonight where you're going tonight be careful but seriously folks
[02:12:26.120 --> 02:12:32.600]  this is amazing okay I'd but but let me just stop right there jacari
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:36.360]  what else are you witnessing while you're there well since we've come here
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:39.320]  we're right here at the border crossing as I pointed out
[02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:43.480]  yesterday we were at the border crossing a few miles from here and there were
[02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:46.680]  people border patrol agents coming up or not so
[02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:49.400]  much talking to us but they would pull up right beside our vehicle
[02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:52.920]  leaning to our vehicle and it was uh somewhat humorous yesterday we just
[02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:56.520]  followed the video report about this we were trying to look for one of these
[02:12:56.520 --> 02:13:00.920]  illegal border crossings and ice agents not ice but border patrol agents
[02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:04.520]  actually began following our vehicle so we were driving down the street and
[02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:06.920]  we're looking in the rear view and I was like you know John talk to the other
[02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:10.040]  guys do you guys think that these guys are following us so we pull over to the
[02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:13.480]  side of the road and the ice guys are excuse me the border patrol agents pull
[02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:17.080]  over there with us okay what'd you say jump well they don't have anything to do
[02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:20.200]  Alex yeah that's right and they don't know where to go
[02:13:20.200 --> 02:13:23.560]  and uh no no that's the pattern is that they harass you for being in a hot
[02:13:23.560 --> 02:13:27.640]  spring at big band they harass you if you've got beer in your cooler
[02:13:27.640 --> 02:13:30.600]  while the illegals in front of me were riding on horses
[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:34.360]  and and walking right past them and loading in vans and driving off
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:38.440]  because they've been told leave them alone only mess with us citizens
[02:13:38.440 --> 02:13:41.880]  we can get some money out of them we're the ones they're looking for and we're
[02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:45.240]  the ones they have the eagle eye for it's come to the point to where
[02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:48.760]  the next illegal i run into i want to ask him hey
[02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:51.720]  would it be okay if we left so you can have the country
[02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:56.280]  would that be do you need us to go uh you know that work out for you well then
[02:13:56.280 --> 02:13:58.440]  there's this argument well everybody's a settler
[02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:01.880]  that was the age of conquest nobody could take the united states the native
[02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:05.240]  tribes were all killing each other trying to always take over from each other
[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:08.280]  i've talked about that last week with the nest of susan but nobody's endorsing
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:11.800]  what happened in the past we have a socialist globalist social engineering
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:16.120]  government telling third world unskilled women with five kids
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:20.120]  come here and we'll bankroll you just vote for socialism
[02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:26.360]  my god this is a nightmare scenario the new world order that's funding al-qaeda
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:29.080]  to take over the middle east is for this
[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:32.840]  is it a good idea you got the president of the united states today
[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:36.360]  honoring the dream act and those illegals coming over
[02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:40.760]  just handing the country over to them and uh was the valourie jared who said
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:44.680]  that they're the best and brightest of us the foreigners
[02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:48.760]  here are some of these uh highlights i g
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:52.280]  irs made a policy decision to legalize illegal aliens
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:56.280]  ended up paying illegals 4.2 billion in refundable credits
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:15:03.640]  in one year boom that is cbs news another cbs our pile border patrol
[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:06.760]  is too busy changing diapers to go after illegal immigrants
[02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:09.640]  the justice department's trying to have him arrested right now here's another
[02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:13.720]  one look at this woman with her the baby in texas real grand valley a seemingly
[02:15:13.720 --> 02:15:17.320]  endless surge of immigrants because the green light has been given
[02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:20.360]  here's the article you mentioned white house to honor
[02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:23.880]  young illegal immigrants jacari john a more
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:27.560]  points you like to make well it is my understanding that john bound just to
[02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:29.880]  receive something extremely racist do you want to share that with us john
[02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:33.480]  bound well it's not quite a sombrero but it's close it's not quite a sombrero
[02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:38.360]  but it's close it's a uh what is this a border patrol hat
[02:15:38.360 --> 02:15:42.760]  so i would imagine that natural citizens like myself wouldn't be aware
[02:15:42.760 --> 02:15:45.560]  allowed to wear this well you know you can't wear that on a college campus
[02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:49.240]  because you would be racist against cowboys yeah that's right yeah and you
[02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:52.840]  can't uh have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches at high schools that's racist
[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:56.440]  everything's racist code except screaming we are the race
[02:15:56.440 --> 02:16:00.280]  uh for those in the race everything for those outside the race nothing la rosa
[02:16:00.280 --> 02:16:06.840]  that's okay yeah la rosa which uh is backed up by bill and melinda gates and
[02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:10.840]  the fort foundation which uh we might be interested in speaking with here pretty
[02:16:10.840 --> 02:16:14.200]  soon as well they have an office here in texas who are funding under bill
[02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:18.760]  melinda gates the force inoculation of old 12 year old mexican girls and it's
[02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:23.320]  linked directly to being sterilized death and autoimmune disorders so
[02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:26.920]  instead of instead of the la rosa groups trying to save their little girls for
[02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:31.240]  being sterilized they'd rather have them flood up here to politically take our
[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:34.360]  guns that's right as long as they can vote
[02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:39.080]  yeah they'll when they become of age to vote yeah they'll be perfect
[02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:41.560]  right now like you were asking us about what happened with that ice interview i
[02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:44.760]  guess i have one more tidbit we could throw out there we talked to this ice
[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:47.800]  agent and we said you know are people coming in with illnesses he said yes
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:50.520]  there are people coming in with illnesses and i say well you know what's the
[02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:53.640]  most common type of thing you see we see and he said well from these uh
[02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:57.240]  central american countries we see people come in with tuberculosis and i say
[02:16:57.240 --> 02:16:59.960]  well what type of uh medical procedures do you have for that he said well we
[02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:03.400]  give them chest x-rays we do all these other types of things and john and i
[02:17:03.400 --> 02:17:07.000]  we were sitting there like well what about the veterans at the va well hey
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:11.800]  what about me hey if i get tuberculosis well let's expand on that if you have
[02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:15.320]  drug resistant tb you're not allowed to fly you're not and you shouldn't be
[02:17:15.320 --> 02:17:18.520]  in fact they lock people up that have the drug immune stuff because it'll cause a
[02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:20.440]  pandemic and and where do they have the worst
[02:17:20.440 --> 02:17:24.360]  tuberculosis in the world central and south america see people haven't been

[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:42.520]  yeah that's that's right and he said you know it's it lowers them around
[02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:45.480]  also makes them concerned they're at the facilities that they're bringing in
[02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:48.120]  people with these diseases well put out the video now you guys are working
[02:17:48.120 --> 02:17:50.600]  around the clock and you're getting bonuses you've done a great job

[02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:04.760]  then show articles about the drug resistant tb so folks know it's not
[02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:07.400]  made up uh and then and then and then put out the
[02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:10.280]  part about how they're basically on stand down

[02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:16.920]  thing to actually see it now add any other points we're going to skip this
[02:18:16.920 --> 02:18:19.160]  network break so stations shouldn't play over this
[02:18:19.160 --> 02:18:22.680]  we're skipping the network break at the cost of like three thousand dollars this
[02:18:22.680 --> 02:18:25.720]  is what i do because this information is too important
[02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:28.920]  i want to skip this network break this four minute break the long break coming
[02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:31.560]  up and i want you guys to turn and walk in
[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:34.920]  there and ask some questions of the border patrol about
[02:18:34.920 --> 02:18:37.800]  what type of infectious diseases are coming across
[02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:41.320]  uh why have you been following us the media don't be their enemies say we

[02:24:03.880 --> 02:24:07.480]  now i'll tell you what well that would probably be the answer is to
[02:24:07.480 --> 02:24:11.080]  literally go across and become a legal alien okay let's get jacarys
[02:24:11.080 --> 02:24:14.120]  plugged in and uh we'll find out what we were
[02:24:14.120 --> 02:24:19.640]  instructed okay anyway this time you guys stay together
[02:24:19.640 --> 02:24:22.520]  gentlemen mr perez the gentleman we talked to was the public
[02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:26.760]  information officer and he was asking us alex he was saying please do not film
[02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:29.240]  the facility and i said okay sir we're not looking for any
[02:24:29.240 --> 02:24:32.680]  any trouble and i was basically trying to tell him well they always act like
[02:24:32.680 --> 02:24:37.160]  filming is bad but then google street has it all jacarys pure bull
[02:24:37.160 --> 02:24:40.120]  okay right go ahead but the thing uh he said
[02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:42.360]  you have to do this the proper way i said sir well how do we do this the
[02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:45.160]  proper way he said well first of all can you get your crew back across the
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:48.280]  street i said all right sir we'll uh we'll buy it by your wishes i'll go
[02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:51.400]  back and talk to him here in a second but first we'll move across the street
[02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:54.600]  and he said you have to do this proper way and i said well what is that he said
[02:24:54.600 --> 02:24:56.920]  you have to tell me what you're doing here i said sir i'd love to tell you
[02:24:56.920 --> 02:24:59.720]  what i'm doing here we're trying to show you this video and so forth he said well
[02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:02.280]  i can't comment on that i can't give you any information
[02:25:02.280 --> 02:25:05.640]  for 21 days i said you're the public information officer but you can't give
[02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:09.480]  me anything for 21 days i said is that standard procedure he said yes it is
[02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:12.840]  so now with that uh i will go back here and talk to this gentleman
[02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:15.880]  and i'll tell you what i found out here and just so they're not going to stop
[02:25:15.880 --> 02:25:20.040]  us we shouldn't have split up and and and you know bottom line we need to show
[02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:23.560]  them upfront saying they can't talk to you you can't report the crimes being
[02:25:23.560 --> 02:25:25.720]  committed because they know the crimes that are being committed
[02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:29.240]  you need to go find border patrol in their vehicles and go knock on their
[02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:33.240]  windows and say here is the address of the safe houses
[02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:37.000]  you know full well and put them on record this is to illustrate
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:40.360]  because people know this is going on it's admitted but we have to visually
[02:25:40.360 --> 02:25:44.680]  illustrate it to the american people now now is that the same facility where the
[02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:49.480]  buses come in and they load on the vans i have not seen any buses as of yet
[02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:53.720]  no i cannot that's in mcallin texas i mean i want to go show that
[02:25:53.720 --> 02:25:57.160]  and and point out where that's going on to these people
[02:25:57.160 --> 02:26:01.480]  uh we found an even better facility and uh we're going to go to that next
[02:26:01.480 --> 02:26:06.520]  it's actually very close and by better you mean there's a more out of control
[02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:10.280]  well by better that it's where they're processing all of the illegals they
[02:26:10.280 --> 02:26:14.120]  catch and they dump them out at night right
[02:26:14.120 --> 02:26:17.240]  all right walk ahead back in here and see if i can get another word with mr
[02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:20.120]  press i'll leave you in john bounce ends all right they're just gonna brush you
[02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:23.400]  off but okay yeah good luck oh yeah he has my
[02:26:23.400 --> 02:26:27.080]  identification he was asking to see my d so i i know i know you gotta get it back
[02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:29.800]  that's fantastic but i mean the whole point is you can
[02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:32.840]  well you can tell our reporters what they say and that'll be in the article how
[02:26:32.840 --> 02:26:35.560]  you were brushed off and say you're not gonna let me report
[02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:39.800]  federal crime and then have him refuse to take it
[02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:43.080]  no grand jury's gonna indict him but the point is it's an illustration
[02:26:43.080 --> 02:26:47.000]  of what's going on here okay right good job right
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:50.520]  there you go and it's going on at all these churches we have their names we
[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:54.040]  have the video and they just like well it's churches you know they're just
[02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:58.440]  helping john bound what do you think about this
[02:26:58.440 --> 02:27:04.200]  uh it's it's getting worse and worse alex uh it's amazing how the illegals
[02:27:04.200 --> 02:27:08.440]  have pretty much taken control of this entire area of texas
[02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:12.360]  and uh their rights are more important than mine and i was born in this country
[02:27:12.360 --> 02:27:16.680]  miles into arizona they have signs saying do not enter this area controlled by
[02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:19.960]  cartels this country is gone we're a joke go ahead
[02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:23.960]  my blood fought for this country my grandfather my great grandfather
[02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:27.080]  and then all the way back fought for this country
[02:27:27.080 --> 02:27:32.120]  and i'm garbage well the point is there is no country we are a
[02:27:32.120 --> 02:27:37.160]  corporate defecation facility i mean we're just here for
[02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:41.800]  anything as we put up with it america was great because we didn't put up with
[02:27:41.800 --> 02:27:44.920]  any garbage now we're pathetic because we put up with everything
[02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:49.320]  we're a nation of compliers a nation of grovelers a nation of slaves
[02:27:49.320 --> 02:27:52.920]  yeah and it's the new world order's chess board and they're using their pieces
[02:27:52.920 --> 02:27:56.680]  right now and we're just the pawns that need to be taken off the board
[02:27:56.680 --> 02:28:00.200]  and uh i'd say the illegals are a bigger chess piece
[02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:04.600]  and completely funded the illegals people with no rights
[02:28:04.600 --> 02:28:08.040]  who should have tremendous respect for any american they meet they look down
[02:28:08.040 --> 02:28:12.360]  their noses at us when they get here that's because all nationalism is allowed
[02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:15.960]  but americana right this is the nation where men are
[02:28:15.960 --> 02:28:19.640]  taught to be metrosexual this is the nation where we're taught to be
[02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:24.760]  slaves yeah and weak and by the way the last thing
[02:28:24.760 --> 02:28:27.640]  they want the last thing those guys want is a scene
[02:28:27.640 --> 02:28:32.600]  with reporters trying to report on how the borders wide open so believe me
[02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:35.720]  you guys are doing anything wrong when they sit there and wave
[02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:39.800]  down now did the guy with us there there's so many border patrol
[02:28:39.800 --> 02:28:42.920]  vans around here in trucks that we can definitely start

[02:36:24.280 --> 02:36:26.520]  don't want to you guys it was your idea to go down there
[02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:29.400]  i'm just saying i would go over to the mexico side
[02:36:29.400 --> 02:36:33.320]  it's so hellishly dangerous you might just show you know out of the car window
[02:36:33.320 --> 02:36:36.680]  how the everything's boarded up everything shut down used to be great
[02:36:36.680 --> 02:36:40.200]  over there at that very crossing just 10 years ago but this is the wonders of
[02:36:40.200 --> 02:36:44.040]  the failed state we're supposed to become then just come through and say hi
[02:36:44.040 --> 02:36:48.280]  yeah we're here from the uh us and we'll say turn your camera off and go
[02:36:48.280 --> 02:36:52.280]  well you got cameras you know i have full right to take this say listen
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:56.040]  we want to show you a crime being committed we want to show a file report
[02:36:56.040 --> 02:36:59.320]  on the illegal alien safehouse can you pull us over here because you're going
[02:36:59.320 --> 02:37:03.240]  to get pulled over to citizens and searched uh as a default to see if you
[02:37:03.240 --> 02:37:07.160]  got drugs because you're you're not a cartel that's paid the cut
[02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:11.000]  so the way to not get searched is to say you want to be searched then you'll be
[02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:14.120]  immediately released because that's the code word for you know you're part of
[02:37:14.120 --> 02:37:17.880]  the club so i'm giving out the secrets now so
[02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:22.520]  you can do it however you want but it's just i would just laugh at them and say
[02:37:22.520 --> 02:37:26.760]  come on guys i'm an american you can see that we're here to you know to
[02:37:26.760 --> 02:37:29.480]  tell you about a crime that's been committed the only way to do it is to
[02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:31.800]  come back through the border that's the only way to talk to one
[02:37:31.800 --> 02:37:35.160]  face to face or you can drive around town and come up knock on their windows
[02:37:35.160 --> 02:37:38.760]  or catch them walking out of stores yeah there are plenty of them around town
[02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:42.040]  when we even coming back to us and we're going to count a border patrol
[02:37:42.040 --> 02:37:45.800]  checkpoint oh you get ready for proctology exams
[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:49.960]  yeah there's a huge facility down here that we could uh we could definitely
[02:37:49.960 --> 02:37:53.400]  do that operation on but we'll yeah no i would go in and say
[02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:57.640]  we're here to report the safe houses and they will literally just say get out
[02:37:57.640 --> 02:38:01.320]  get out of here they don't want to know yeah pretty much yeah
[02:38:01.320 --> 02:38:03.880]  now if your college students coming back through you're going to get your teeth
[02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:06.360]  knocked out
[02:38:06.920 --> 02:38:12.680]  or do they need help changing diapers or making sandwiches
[02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:17.560]  you could ask them that say fine we will help you change diapers
[02:38:17.560 --> 02:38:21.080]  they'd probably make them really happy so then they don't have to do it
[02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:25.080]  all right guys i've been ranting here the big mother loads tonight i know

[02:44:52.920 --> 02:44:56.360]  get in the last year and a half even before we sold it before it was available
[02:44:56.360 --> 02:45:01.480]  the true nascent pure blue purple when it was put on paper just to show
[02:45:01.480 --> 02:45:04.520]  that it's the true i mean you can look it up
[02:45:04.520 --> 02:45:08.840]  color of pure true nascent iodine it's 99.99 it's from the crystals nobody
[02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:11.720]  else has got it well now we've come out with an even deeper
[02:45:11.720 --> 02:45:16.280]  earth source of this you can see in the video we're playing of your tv view or
[02:45:16.280 --> 02:45:19.480]  the light blue of the old survival show we still sell great for kids check with
[02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:22.680]  your physician before you do and then in a time test
[02:45:22.680 --> 02:45:28.520]  it turns electric violet purple and then total dark purple from the survival
[02:45:28.520 --> 02:45:31.960]  shield x2 the strongest nascent iodine out there
[02:45:31.960 --> 02:45:37.240]  and it is simply amazing from seven to 12 000 feet
[02:45:37.240 --> 02:45:40.600]  that's the levels of the drilled mine that has it and then we have the actual
[02:45:40.600 --> 02:45:46.200]  factory video up at infowarslife.com with the still images at infowarslife.com
[02:45:46.200 --> 02:45:48.200]  we'll take you to the shopping cart and show you
[02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:50.760]  where you can see the videos and everything there and read about the
[02:45:50.760 --> 02:45:55.560]  science of what this does in your body bioavailability
[02:45:55.560 --> 02:45:59.880]  regular iodine the government used to recommend was in salt
[02:45:59.880 --> 02:46:02.920]  because they didn't care about people there was massive brain damage and mental
[02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:05.960]  problems and goiter and everything else till they recommended it then for
[02:46:05.960 --> 02:46:09.080]  some reason they pulled it back out and put the bad stuff in the food chain
[02:46:09.080 --> 02:46:12.760]  the bad halogens the good halogen ladies and gentlemen this is the pure good
[02:46:12.760 --> 02:46:16.600]  halogen iodine and it just supercharges everything in my
[02:46:16.600 --> 02:46:19.080]  body i mean you've heard what it does this is the
[02:46:19.080 --> 02:46:23.560]  next level now i'll warn you i will warn you
[02:46:23.560 --> 02:46:27.080]  the first weaker form that we had of this that was still proprietary and nobody
[02:46:27.080 --> 02:46:30.360]  else had made me have that toxic effect i forget the
[02:46:30.360 --> 02:46:33.400]  exact name of it where you detox in 15 to 20 days
[02:46:33.400 --> 02:46:36.760]  and you feel bad for about a week so check with your physician or healthcare
[02:46:36.760 --> 02:46:41.160]  provider just be informed before the new stuff
[02:46:41.160 --> 02:46:45.320]  is you know once you've been accustomed in any of you so choose
[02:46:45.320 --> 02:46:49.320]  or you want to take a lighter dose okay me personally
[02:46:49.320 --> 02:46:54.120]  i just cannot describe to you how evil the globalist are that they
[02:46:54.120 --> 02:46:58.440]  have taken this out of the food chain while the elite are obsessed with iodine
[02:46:58.440 --> 02:47:01.720]  and this is the one thing that the you know even the establishment tends to
[02:47:01.720 --> 02:47:05.000]  leave folks alone about because they know themselves
[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.960]  people that promote this they know themselves it's important i mean they
[02:47:07.960 --> 02:47:13.320]  know this is it the pineal gland the thyroid
[02:47:13.320 --> 02:47:16.920]  i mean from what i've talked to doctor group and others about this just goes
[02:47:16.920 --> 02:47:20.280]  out it's so active so so chemically active it just
[02:47:20.280 --> 02:47:23.880]  goes out and just strips the garbage out
[02:47:25.080 --> 02:47:27.640]  and what it's done for me in the middle clarity and everything else is simply

[02:48:59.160 --> 02:49:02.280]  your feedback i'm just on my lunch break here so
[02:49:02.280 --> 02:49:08.840]  i'll be quick. The first one is if you used to ask people outside of America
[02:49:08.840 --> 02:49:13.240]  what they thought of Americans they used to tell you that i like Americans
[02:49:13.240 --> 02:49:17.640]  but i just don't like their government that's starting to change now
[02:49:17.640 --> 02:49:21.480]  where people are no longer saying that giving them that sort of leeway where
[02:49:21.480 --> 02:49:25.880]  now people are actually wanting to hold Americans speak to the fire
[02:49:25.880 --> 02:49:30.520]  i mean it's it's quite interesting that i know i agree i get mad by some slack
[02:49:30.520 --> 02:49:33.480]  jawed yuppie this happens about once a week when i'm in a restaurant or
[02:49:33.480 --> 02:49:36.360]  something they'll walk over because this is what liberals do
[02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:40.040]  fake liberals they'll go aha you're a cook nobody likes you
[02:49:40.040 --> 02:49:43.720]  and i say listen i know you're in group sync i know everything about you i know
[02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:47.960]  your profile you're a pathetic slave this is a private establishment gets
[02:49:47.960 --> 02:49:51.560]  your ass away from my table before i have you thrown out of here
[02:49:51.560 --> 02:49:56.520]  and they'll go oh i go listen punk i don't have time i i i agree with you
[02:49:56.520 --> 02:49:59.640]  i'm sorry for talking like that i apologize to the affiliates i won't do
[02:49:59.640 --> 02:50:02.760]  it anymore i'm trying my hardest but go ahead
[02:50:02.760 --> 02:50:06.200]  i'm a Canadian i like to straight shoot the other one i'd like to get your
[02:50:06.200 --> 02:50:10.680]  feedback on is sort of a metaphor i sort of see this
[02:50:10.680 --> 02:50:17.080]  population as ants in an ant farm and even if we all got together and we all
[02:50:17.080 --> 02:50:20.040]  worked for unity we still have this farmer who's
[02:50:20.040 --> 02:50:23.480]  outside that ant farm who's in total control
[02:50:23.480 --> 02:50:27.480]  we can have nice cars nice homes even have nice relationships but when it
[02:50:27.480 --> 02:50:31.800]  really comes down to it that's farmer is in total control
[02:50:31.800 --> 02:50:36.440]  and that's what top globalist uh Nobel prize winner
[02:50:36.440 --> 02:50:39.960]  his name will pop in my head Bertrand Russell said in three different books
[02:50:39.960 --> 02:50:43.880]  he said our scientific dictatorship will so control the environment with an
[02:50:43.880 --> 02:50:46.920]  artificial reality when we're dying that rebelling against our
[02:50:46.920 --> 02:50:50.360]  technocracy will be like sheep rebelling against the practice of eating
[02:50:50.360 --> 02:50:56.760]  mutton which is adult sheep so absolutely devastatingly well said Kevin
[02:50:56.760 --> 02:50:59.880]  yeah people that serve this system are just idiots
[02:50:59.880 --> 02:51:03.720]  our founders pledge their lives fortunes and sacred honor to fight tyranny and

[02:54:26.520 --> 02:54:31.000]  gcn up in minnesota has had devices hitting

[02:54:56.440 --> 02:55:00.920]  and taking us down they admit that and we've been attacked by
[02:55:00.920 --> 02:55:05.000]  north com computers i mean they don't even hide where they direct this stuff
[02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:09.320]  nsa stuff after our reporters went to the nsa they took over our cell phones
[02:55:09.320 --> 02:55:14.280]  took over a bunch of computers messed with stuff and we just love it i mean
[02:55:14.280 --> 02:55:17.720]  that only makes us better to add more redundancy and stuff
[02:55:17.720 --> 02:55:21.160]  i mean we're here to defend the republic we know we're in a war
[02:55:21.160 --> 02:55:25.880]  we don't just fall down on the ground in a fetal position when something happens
[02:55:25.880 --> 02:55:29.080]  uh but uh we've stayed up and on the air
[02:55:29.080 --> 02:55:32.200]  but that's the type of stuff that's going on where it's not like computer
[02:55:32.200 --> 02:55:36.760]  stuff it's not like it's like stuxnet where they're coming in trying to block
[02:55:36.760 --> 02:55:41.400]  hardwired stuff and using it as a practice to take the country down
[02:55:41.400 --> 02:55:46.920]  let's talk to uh mary in washington mary you're on the air go ahead
[02:55:46.920 --> 02:55:52.280]  hi alex um i was watching your special report proof
[02:55:52.280 --> 02:55:56.520]  we run al-qaeda which is a june 14th on youtube anyway
[02:55:56.520 --> 02:56:00.280]  and i made the observation that some of these
[02:56:00.280 --> 02:56:04.680]  you know al-qaeda redux uh isis characters look all
[02:56:04.680 --> 02:56:08.680]  i'll really beef you like american football players and then i wondered
[02:56:08.680 --> 02:56:12.200]  why would the saudi princes the secular saudi princes
[02:56:12.200 --> 02:56:18.360]  those you know leches and womanizers and so on why would they try and rely on
[02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:21.560]  al-qaeda or isis so that would be like herding cats
[02:56:21.560 --> 02:56:25.720]  when they could simply hire blackwater security mercenaries
[02:56:25.720 --> 02:56:29.960]  or whatever they're calling themselves because blackwater would work directly
[02:56:29.960 --> 02:56:33.240]  through a contract not through saudi arabia
[02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:36.600]  and you probably couldn't get blackwater to go around and actually overthrow
[02:56:36.600 --> 02:56:40.280]  iraq again they're not even that immoral the average special forces person that's
[02:56:40.280 --> 02:56:43.240]  in that halfway has to sign on to what they're doing
[02:56:43.240 --> 02:56:46.600]  so they always use saudi arabia since 1901
[02:56:46.600 --> 02:56:50.200]  to take over the countries there so they're using the big army they have
[02:56:50.200 --> 02:56:55.080]  that they just used against syria that's that's why they're using that group
[02:56:55.080 --> 02:57:00.760]  um i i was thinking that anyone could be behind those ski masks but you know we
[02:57:00.760 --> 02:57:04.200]  had an agreement with saudi arabia that we protect them militarily
[02:57:04.200 --> 02:57:09.640]  so saudi arabia might have just gotten tired of waiting waiting for us you know
[02:57:09.640 --> 02:57:13.160]  and just picked up the ball and gone with it they might might have developed an
[02:57:13.160 --> 02:57:15.800]  army sufficient enough to do whatever it is they want to do
[02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:20.520]  sure mary i appreciate your call listen we know what went on
[02:57:20.520 --> 02:57:25.240]  i mean this is not hidden that they trained these military at bases in
[02:57:25.240 --> 02:57:28.600]  jordan in syria and controlled areas in western iraq
[02:57:28.600 --> 02:57:33.560]  that's mainstream news now so this was set up to destabilize the whole region
[02:57:33.560 --> 02:57:37.880]  for saudi arabia bottom line by the way we just got a contact
[02:57:37.880 --> 02:57:41.560]  from ford hood we'll give you a document cam shot of this
[02:57:41.560 --> 02:57:48.120]  info wars dot com per the texas military force acceptable use
[02:57:48.120 --> 02:57:52.280]  policy uh and so this is out of the texas
[02:57:52.280 --> 02:57:56.360]  guard i guess out at camp maybury and we got this contact in ford hood
[02:57:56.360 --> 02:58:04.040]  your ip address 55 90 53.46 url info wars dot com category of this url
[02:58:04.040 --> 02:58:09.000]  violence hate racism and i told you they have gambling they have porn
[02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:12.440]  they have hacking they have the category of violence hate racism
[02:58:12.440 --> 02:58:15.880]  that's obama talk we're banned on military bases
[02:58:15.880 --> 02:58:19.480]  so they did this a long time ago and it backfired everyone on the military
[02:58:19.480 --> 02:58:22.440]  it is your duty for the first amendment even if you don't believe in what we're
[02:58:22.440 --> 02:58:26.440]  saying but which we know most of you do your patriots tell friends and family
[02:58:26.440 --> 02:58:30.840]  about info wars dot com tell folks about off base my films youtube
[02:58:30.840 --> 02:58:35.080]  this is shiny style net censorship so the military doesn't find out
[02:58:35.080 --> 02:58:37.960]  like last time that our government's running al-qaeda
[02:58:37.960 --> 02:58:42.280]  so you don't start that campaign again to say i will not fight for al-qaeda
[02:58:42.280 --> 02:58:47.000]  in iraq that quite frankly the three dr kari and dorsal kata today i want to
[02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.560]  blow them up i want to bomb them i hate them

[03:01:01.720 --> 03:01:05.080]  feed the beast uh yes we can follow the good example of
[03:01:05.080 --> 03:01:10.040]  tax protester cindy shean especially in view of the article article like billions
[03:01:10.040 --> 03:01:15.480]  over bagdad 2007 vanity fair where out of 12 billion dollars from the fed
[03:01:15.480 --> 03:01:19.400]  that was sent to buy off the iraqi coalition provisional authority nine
[03:01:19.400 --> 03:01:22.680]  billion dollars went missing i'm sure you've seen the picture of the
[03:01:22.680 --> 03:01:25.800]  public ballots of cash it just yeah that was just the first row out it's as
[03:01:25.800 --> 03:01:29.800]  high as 80 billion and they even gave privates up to 30 grand
[03:01:29.800 --> 03:01:33.320]  to corrupt them and threaten to arrest them later so the military couldn't
[03:01:33.320 --> 03:01:37.080]  speak out right right and they've got to pay
[03:01:37.080 --> 03:01:41.400]  off the puppets irons both within and without our country for any hope of
[03:01:41.400 --> 03:01:44.840]  future control over them so let's stop working for
[03:01:44.840 --> 03:01:48.440]  a privately owned unaccountable central bank controlling all our currency and
[03:01:48.440 --> 03:01:52.280]  credit which can only be spent at venues which accept it
[03:01:52.280 --> 03:01:56.120]  all our company stores and in our fascist company
[03:01:56.120 --> 03:01:59.560]  town country yet but instead we're establishing
[03:01:59.560 --> 03:02:04.360]  all options for the fed such as publicly accountable community currencies
[03:02:04.360 --> 03:02:08.120]  that are denominated in time so they are actually nationally and
[03:02:08.120 --> 03:02:11.960]  internationally exchangeable and things like cooper
[03:02:11.960 --> 03:02:15.880]  exactly go to the amish go to the farmers market plant your own garden
[03:02:15.880 --> 03:02:19.960]  get out of the system get off the grid as much as you can eat healthy
[03:02:19.960 --> 03:02:23.640]  be loving to each other speak out against the globalist
[03:02:23.640 --> 03:02:27.400]  well said that's how you bring them down is exposing their operations
[03:02:27.400 --> 03:02:30.520]  and and and it didn't matter if the zombies want to go along with it a
[03:02:30.520 --> 03:02:35.560]  large minority can stop this dave in california you're on the air go ahead
[03:02:35.560 --> 03:02:40.040]  hey alex i was calling to let you know that um what the ice is
[03:02:40.040 --> 03:02:46.440]  being going on there is um 400 ligates and camp robert here in california
[03:02:46.440 --> 03:02:51.320]  and the bases are packed and the the military officers are staying
[03:02:51.320 --> 03:02:56.040]  there training for iraq that's what they're doing right now over there
[03:02:56.040 --> 03:02:59.560]  yeah and then they'll get part of the country to the al-qaeda folks saying it
[03:02:59.560 --> 03:03:03.160]  was a deal with them partition the nation call the other part curd and the
[03:03:03.160 --> 03:03:06.600]  other part she i break it in three pieces always been the plan and they're
[03:03:06.600 --> 03:03:10.520]  now promoting that right now totally disgusting anything else
[03:03:10.520 --> 03:03:15.160]  now that's just it man keep it up brother thank you go ahead
[03:03:15.160 --> 03:03:18.200]  thank you and bottom line we are being blocked at more bases

[03:03:25.480 --> 03:03:28.040]  happening to you but this is out of ford hood and i
[03:03:28.040 --> 03:03:32.120]  guess they might have been looking at a texas guard portal when they got
[03:03:32.120 --> 03:03:36.600]  blocked but that's a texas guard uh reports saying not allowed to go to
[03:03:36.600 --> 03:03:39.480]  that i guess because we showed them running checkpoints and stuff for the
[03:03:39.480 --> 03:03:43.960]  kite festival and how they're being federalized i guess that's a big no no
[03:03:43.960 --> 03:03:47.000]  uh let's go ahead and talk to scott michigan you're on the air thanks for
[03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:50.520]  calling hello alex yeah i'm just calling about how they're really
