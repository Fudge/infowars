[00:00:05.034 --> 00:00:09.855]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cops.
[00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:11.436]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.436 --> 00:00:12.996]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:17.177]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.177 --> 00:00:29.580]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.701]  Tuesday, June 16th,
[00:00:32.557 --> 00:00:35.479]  2014 we are live.
[00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:36.239]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.161]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.161 --> 00:01:02.197]  Our reporters John Bowne, Jakari Jackson, Adan Salazar, and of course Joe Jennings are all down on the Texas-Mexico border or the former Texas border here in FEMA Region 6 where just everywhere you turn there are just floods of illegal aliens pouring across being greeted by bureaucrats and lawyers, women with multiple children in tow,
[00:01:05.478 --> 00:01:14.043]  Having them handed over to the government and churches to instantly go on welfare and then to instantly be given driver's license to then vote.
[00:01:15.839 --> 00:01:26.024]  Our own David Knight got rammed by an illegal alien the other day, and the guy was like crazy, ramming him with a dump truck into the street across the red light.
[00:01:26.024 --> 00:01:30.886]  And the cops got there and just said, we're not going to do anything, he's above the law, there's nothing you can do.
[00:01:30.886 --> 00:01:34.167]  And they basically saluted the guy, and that was the end of it.
[00:01:34.167 --> 00:01:42.471]  And I've talked to Travis County prosecutors, senior ones who've come to this office, senior ones, and said, you need to look into this.
[00:01:42.471 --> 00:01:43.952]  I'm like, look into it, I know about it.
[00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:51.333]  And they're like, listen, police are told don't bring them in or the judge gives them a $5 to $20 fine.
[00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:54.135]  All they do is give the illegal a $5 or $20 fine.
[00:01:54.135 --> 00:01:56.856]  They tell the police, you get plump citizens.
[00:01:56.856 --> 00:01:58.157]  They are the schmucks.
[00:01:58.157 --> 00:01:59.358]  They are the suckers.
[00:01:59.358 --> 00:02:00.558]  They are the jokes.
[00:02:00.558 --> 00:02:01.679]  They are the target.
[00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.220]  They are the enemy.
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.623]  You got an American citizen with three kids in the back, obviously working two jobs, doesn't have any money.
[00:02:08.623 --> 00:02:10.064]  Hit them and hit them hard!
[00:02:10.064 --> 00:02:11.465]  Drive her into bankruptcy!
[00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:13.386]  Drive her into cloward and pivot!
[00:02:13.386 --> 00:02:14.227]  But if it's an illegal,
[00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.570]  I read you the AP headline.
[00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.771]  Bloomberg also reported on it.
[00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:23.672]  Chris Jordan was able to find it just a few weeks ago.
[00:02:23.672 --> 00:02:38.275]  It was an article from 2005, where the bank's presidents were bragging to AP that, yes, we give them bank loans that no one else gets with no IDs, because we want to be friendly and help.
[00:02:38.275 --> 00:02:41.655]  No, the globalists want an incentive to bankrupt the country.
[00:02:41.655 --> 00:02:44.916]  And once it's bankrupted, then the illegals won't get a free ride anymore.
[00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:47.810]  So this isn't even about a hatred of the illegals.
[00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.232]  If I was in an employed third world country, and there was a place with better opportunities, I would come up here.
[00:02:52.232 --> 00:03:10.680]  If I was a Mexican woman, and had two kids, and my husband had run off, and I was living in a dirt floor shack down on the suburbs of Mexico City, I'd get on a bus and come up here, and come right into the wedding arms, and they'd go, Senorita, all you gotta do is vote for the Democrats, and you'll get everything you want.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.640]  Well, what's she gonna do?
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.161]  Yeah, there it is, CNN money.
[00:03:15.148 --> 00:03:16.428]  Banking on illegal immigrants.
[00:03:16.428 --> 00:03:20.570]  Banks are seeing an untapped resource of providing home loans to undocumented U.S.
[00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.790]  residents.
[00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.831]  That's a similar article along the AP and Bloomberg article.
[00:03:24.831 --> 00:03:27.212]  It was back in 2005, as I said.
[00:03:27.212 --> 00:03:28.573]  They had an advertisement.
[00:03:28.573 --> 00:03:30.534]  See, you learn how media works.
[00:03:30.534 --> 00:03:32.934]  That's why my brain burns when I see the news.
[00:03:32.934 --> 00:03:35.575]  It's very painful to even try to explain it because I have too much proof.
[00:03:35.575 --> 00:03:40.337]  It's like putting on a prosecution, per article, slam-dunk prosecutions.
[00:03:40.337 --> 00:03:42.578]  You've still got to put on the slam-dunk prosecution.
[00:03:44.264 --> 00:03:48.808]  And if the public can't see it, I don't know what to do.
[00:03:48.808 --> 00:03:53.151]  But they had all these articles telling the illegals, you can go get a home loan, you can go get a home loan.
[00:03:53.151 --> 00:03:54.392]  And then who bailed all that out?
[00:03:54.392 --> 00:03:57.214]  The taxpayer again.
[00:03:57.214 --> 00:04:06.001]  Well, you don't think in Atlanta and Austin, Texas a few years ago, when it came out that per address $86 million, $151 million, these were addresses in Atlanta and Austin, Texas,
[00:04:11.308 --> 00:04:18.110]  That we're getting tax returns where you would have listed five people as residents getting 86 million dollars.
[00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.732]  By the way, no prosecutions, no investigations.
[00:04:21.732 --> 00:04:25.573]  Where do you think 86 million dollars went?
[00:04:25.573 --> 00:04:28.534]  It was laundered back into the Democratic Party.
[00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:30.495]  And the Republicans at play ball.
[00:04:30.495 --> 00:04:32.295]  That's why there's a criminal takeover.
[00:04:32.295 --> 00:04:34.676]  Because they're robbing everything.
[00:04:34.676 --> 00:04:38.777]  You don't think the illegals in the House got 86 mil, do you?
[00:04:38.777 --> 00:04:40.218]  They're lucky they got a hundred grand.
[00:04:41.871 --> 00:04:50.283]  The globalists use illegals as the underground black market that they can run all the drugs, launder the money, the sex, all of it through those groups.
[00:04:50.283 --> 00:04:56.431]  Then any other group tries to run a criminal op, shut down with the NSA tracker systems instantly.
[00:04:56.431 --> 00:04:57.894]  And by the way, that all came out in the New York Times.
[00:04:59.642 --> 00:05:04.604]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[00:05:04.604 --> 00:05:07.945]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[00:05:07.945 --> 00:05:10.066]  She's just not the woman I married.
[00:05:10.066 --> 00:05:12.206]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[00:05:12.206 --> 00:05:13.847]  Does this seem familiar?
[00:05:13.847 --> 00:05:17.188]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[00:05:17.188 --> 00:05:18.769]  If so, consider this.
[00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:27.692]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[00:05:28.052 --> 00:05:34.435]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[00:05:34.435 --> 00:05:36.496]  Forget synthetic chemicals.
[00:05:36.496 --> 00:05:44.080]  Super Female Vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives.

[00:05:57.708 --> 00:05:58.769]  Live life healthy.
[00:05:58.769 --> 00:06:03.411]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:07.474]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:11.416]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:06:11.416 --> 00:06:14.477]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:06:14.477 --> 00:06:22.020]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.662]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:06:25.942 --> 00:06:30.363]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:06:30.363 --> 00:06:36.325]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:06:36.325 --> 00:06:40.386]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:06:40.386 --> 00:06:43.007]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:06:43.007 --> 00:06:44.508]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:06:44.508 --> 00:06:45.868]  It's time to take action.
[00:06:45.868 --> 00:06:47.689]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:06:59.375 --> 00:07:06.541]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:07:06.541 --> 00:07:08.903]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:07:08.903 --> 00:07:14.168]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:07:14.168 --> 00:07:19.112]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:07:19.332 --> 00:07:22.675]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:07:22.675 --> 00:07:26.738]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:31.062]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:07:31.062 --> 00:07:41.291]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:07:41.291 --> 00:07:43.813]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:07:43.953 --> 00:07:44.113]  G.I.
[00:07:44.113 --> 00:07:44.393]  Joe!
[00:07:44.393 --> 00:07:44.593]  G.I.
[00:07:44.593 --> 00:07:44.773]  Joe!
[00:07:44.773 --> 00:07:45.834]  Launch the operation!
[00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:20.033]  You are a programmable guy that goes and watches Olympus is Falling and believes all this and really thinks you're a hero.
[00:08:20.033 --> 00:08:20.693]  G.I.
[00:08:20.693 --> 00:08:22.994]  Joe, great American hero.
[00:08:22.994 --> 00:08:24.174]  Joe, Joe.
[00:08:24.174 --> 00:08:25.614]  You don't work for Joe.
[00:08:25.614 --> 00:08:27.655]  Joe got taken over.
[00:08:27.655 --> 00:08:28.215]  The G.I.
[00:08:28.215 --> 00:08:30.796]  Joe command base is run by Cobra.
[00:08:31.616 --> 00:08:32.817]  You understand that?
[00:08:32.817 --> 00:08:36.979]  And I use a child analogy to get through to you, because that's your main programming template.
[00:08:36.979 --> 00:08:39.360]  You're on record with that.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.441]  That was all Pentagon directed.
[00:08:41.441 --> 00:08:43.262]  You understand, you work for Cobra.
[00:08:43.262 --> 00:08:44.743]  You dress like Cobra.
[00:08:44.743 --> 00:08:46.423]  You have the tactics of Cobra.
[00:08:46.423 --> 00:08:47.684]  You are Cobra.
[00:08:47.684 --> 00:08:48.645]  Hail Cobra!
[00:08:49.605 --> 00:08:50.666]  You want to be little boys?
[00:08:50.666 --> 00:08:53.609]  Or do you want to really join the Republic?
[00:08:53.609 --> 00:08:58.735]  They know what's going on at the Bundy Ranch, and they won't even let a police information officer give us any information.
[00:08:58.735 --> 00:08:59.956]  That's a bunch of bull****.
[00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:01.378]  It's all these stupid G.I.
[00:09:01.378 --> 00:09:04.261]  Joe movies and stuff, where the White House is attacked.
[00:09:04.261 --> 00:09:05.963]  The White House is run by Cobra!
[00:09:06.483 --> 00:09:14.570]  When I went through the process of becoming press secretary, one of the things, one of the first things they told me was, you're not even to acknowledge the drone program.
[00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.512]  You're not even to discuss that it exists.
[00:09:17.512 --> 00:09:19.154]  It's run by chaos!
[00:09:19.154 --> 00:09:21.135]  It's run by Spectre!
[00:09:21.135 --> 00:09:30.323]  They run little kids, they run the snuff films, they run the drugs, they run it all!
[00:09:30.323 --> 00:09:34.927]  And because you act like a bunch of naive chumps, this whole thing's gonna come down on us!
[00:09:35.327 --> 00:09:41.591]  Very much concerns me, considering that they have all this bulk ammunition that they're shooting targets of children.
[00:09:41.591 --> 00:09:44.213]  Would you like to tell me who it is that is doing this?
[00:09:44.213 --> 00:09:46.774]  It is the Department of Homeland Security, sir.
[00:09:46.774 --> 00:09:48.715]  Oh, thank you for calling.
[00:09:48.715 --> 00:09:54.859]  To every police officer in this country, to every FBI agent, to every Secret Service agent, you work for Spectre.
[00:09:54.859 --> 00:09:56.180]  You work for Kaos.
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:01.223]  You work for Cobra.
[00:10:01.223 --> 00:10:02.224]  How do they get power?
[00:10:02.224 --> 00:10:03.465]  They stage a terror attack.
[00:10:04.889 --> 00:10:11.033]  Using Spectre, using Cobra.
[00:10:11.033 --> 00:10:12.254]  Go f*** yourself.
[00:10:12.254 --> 00:10:13.034]  Who is Cobra?
[00:10:13.034 --> 00:10:16.837]  Arms dealing, drug dealing, money laundering group, wearing masks.
[00:10:16.837 --> 00:10:21.379]  They wear masks, ladies and gentlemen, because they're the corporate CEOs.
[00:10:21.379 --> 00:10:24.141]  And they're manipulating the governments against each other.
[00:10:24.141 --> 00:10:25.702]  Cobra runs the Muslims.
[00:10:25.702 --> 00:10:27.523]  Cobra runs the CIA.
[00:10:27.523 --> 00:10:28.924]  Cobra runs it all.
[00:10:28.924 --> 00:10:30.405]  Cobra is real.
[00:10:30.405 --> 00:10:31.906]  You can call it whatever you want.
[00:10:33.203 --> 00:10:41.328]  Cobra is in control of America, and Cobra says the veterans and the gun owners, they're saying that we're the bad guys.
[00:10:41.328 --> 00:10:46.691]  These people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not.
[00:10:46.691 --> 00:10:49.192]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[00:10:49.192 --> 00:10:50.813]  That's what Cobra would say.
[00:10:50.813 --> 00:10:52.554]  That's what Specter would say.
[00:10:52.554 --> 00:10:57.016]  That's what Goldfinger would say, because that's who those people are.
[00:10:57.016 --> 00:11:00.919]  I am Supreme Cobra Commander!
[00:11:01.659 --> 00:11:06.563]  You call your petty bureaucrats officials and authorities?
[00:11:06.563 --> 00:11:11.367]  You will kneel before Cobra of faith!
[00:11:11.367 --> 00:11:13.148]  My word!
[00:11:13.148 --> 00:11:17.252]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:11:17.252 --> 00:11:18.493]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:11:18.493 --> 00:11:20.054]  Let's burn missiles to ashes!
[00:11:20.054 --> 00:11:22.936]  Thank you for joining us, Mr. Cobra Leader.
[00:11:22.936 --> 00:11:25.038]  You pathetic little worm!
[00:11:25.038 --> 00:11:27.760]  How dare you call me Mr. Cobra!
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.662]  Ladies and gentlemen, that little promo piece has been out for a few months.
[00:11:34.662 --> 00:11:37.544]  Shikari Jackson put that together from past statements I've made.
[00:11:37.544 --> 00:11:42.448]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see the free feeds at infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:11:42.448 --> 00:11:45.790]  Or if you're a subscriber over at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:50.713]  But I think the audio transfers over to the main audience.
[00:11:50.713 --> 00:11:54.796]  The radio listeners want to welcome everyone to the main transmission here today.
[00:11:54.796 --> 00:11:56.557]  It is Tuesday, the 17th day of June, 2014.
[00:12:00.376 --> 00:12:27.366]  We are going to first break down the fact, and my crew's looking for it, but we don't mark down every word I say, but everyone knows that since Benghazi took place a few years ago, even before that with the Libya situation, the West is giving high-tech, modern, surface-to-air anti-aircraft missiles to certified real al-Qaeda.
[00:12:28.427 --> 00:12:31.949]  To their command base in Benghazi, which then took over all of Libya.
[00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:39.733]  They even had the weapons last year shooting them at helicopters in the country of Egypt.
[00:12:39.733 --> 00:12:44.195]  Till the military crushed them and CNN called the military, you know, violent terrorist.
[00:12:44.195 --> 00:12:48.418]  Because they dare fight back against Al Qaeda.
[00:12:48.418 --> 00:12:52.960]  And now, it is on Fox News, CNN, you name it.
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.261]  Oh, we've got to take your rights.
[00:12:55.885 --> 00:13:00.672]  Because Al-Qaeda and ISIS have gotten Stinger missiles.
[00:13:00.672 --> 00:13:00.972]  Why?
[00:13:00.972 --> 00:13:02.535]  They must have overrun U.S.
[00:13:02.535 --> 00:13:06.040]  bases and found them just lying there like U.S.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.385]  military pulls out of bases and just leaves Stinger missiles laying there on the ground.
[00:13:12.622 --> 00:13:29.949]  Remember last week, last Friday, I shot a video of a 20-minute special report for the Nightly News where I showed the Pentagon putting out statements to the AP that, oh, we think ISIS that's connected to Al-Qaeda might have found some of our weapons at bases that we left behind.
[00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:31.350]  That's why they've got U.S.
[00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:32.590]  weapons.
[00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:33.430]  Uh-huh.
[00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.672]  Uh-huh.
[00:13:36.672 --> 00:13:39.053]  And then they have the neocons come in and give Obama cover.
[00:13:40.275 --> 00:13:41.376]  He's not doing enough!
[00:13:41.376 --> 00:13:43.518]  He should invade and blow up Al-Qaeda!
[00:13:43.518 --> 00:13:50.343]  They know full well they armed Al-Qaeda, along with the Republican Democratic Party backing it, in the last three and a half years to attack Syria right on the border.
[00:13:50.343 --> 00:13:55.286]  And they took over part of Syria and used that as a command base right across the border from Iraq.
[00:13:55.286 --> 00:14:03.512]  And the Iraqi military in the last three months has been blowing up military bases and convoys as they try to come across the border.
[00:14:03.512 --> 00:14:05.394]  And they know Al-Qaeda has taken over
[00:14:07.935 --> 00:14:11.796]  Fallujah to Crete and other areas and it's been on the back burner in our news.
[00:14:11.796 --> 00:14:24.278]  There have been giant five-mile long convoys of well-organized vehicles with medium and light weapons and high-tech weapons pouring across.
[00:14:24.278 --> 00:14:35.820]  You don't think they couldn't have had a bunch of drones come in and take them out highway of death style like 1991 when Saddam's forces fled out of Kuwait back into
[00:14:37.665 --> 00:14:39.707]  Iraq?
[00:14:39.707 --> 00:14:47.092]  Obama's golfing in Palm Springs looking at his retirement home while Obama doesn't know what's going on.
[00:14:47.092 --> 00:15:02.284]  This is a Saudi Arabian proxy army, and I of course said that months ago, years ago, but months ago, so they were getting ready to take down Iraq, at least the entire bottom half of it, because that's the globalist plan.
[00:15:02.284 --> 00:15:05.126]  They've had these guys take over Libya, try to take over
[00:15:06.488 --> 00:15:10.129]  Syria trying to take over Egypt.
[00:15:10.129 --> 00:15:26.955]  That's how evil our so-called government is, folks, that they would try to turn the stable government of Egypt, 35 years working with the United States, from an old policy set up when JFK left office at LBJ to stabilize the region.
[00:15:26.955 --> 00:15:28.795]  Christians, Muslims could live in peace.
[00:15:28.795 --> 00:15:29.876]  You could buy property there.
[00:15:29.876 --> 00:15:30.816]  You could be left alone.
[00:15:30.816 --> 00:15:32.196]  You could be a good tourist.
[00:15:32.196 --> 00:15:33.477]  Prosperity for the country.
[00:15:34.673 --> 00:15:36.975]  That is now gone.
[00:15:36.975 --> 00:15:41.299]  And how many times did I tell you, we've got to find the clip.
[00:15:41.299 --> 00:15:44.541]  I mean, we've got to just start, I guess, paying to have a transcript made every day.
[00:15:44.541 --> 00:15:49.806]  It would cost probably $400, $300 a day, but the computers are getting good enough to do it.
[00:15:49.806 --> 00:15:55.150]  So just search and turn everything into a Word document every day, like the NSA does with everybody's phone conversations.
[00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:57.833]  We should do it ourselves so we can search my comments.
[00:15:57.833 --> 00:16:02.797]  But I probably, let's not exaggerate, I probably said
[00:16:04.992 --> 00:16:30.998]  A hundred and fifty times, because I did it on dozens of broadcasts, and I would do it each time over and over again on these broadcasts, that you will hear them say, Al-Qaeda affiliated groups have gotten Stinger, modern Stinger missiles, these aren't left over from the 80s, well the CIA gave it to them, and they're going to shoot down airliners in the US and Europe, we've got to take your liberties, because Al-Qaeda's now got service to air missiles that will shoot down airliners.
[00:16:30.998 --> 00:16:31.978]  Last night and this morning,
[00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:39.033]  All I heard was, see we need Homeland Security more than ever, we need checkpoints on the highways.
[00:16:39.033 --> 00:16:54.082]  I saw Senator Mendez, it just went on and on, saying this has all got to be done because of the fact that Stinger missiles are about to kill us right now.
[00:16:54.082 --> 00:16:56.284]  And all it'll take is some private contractors.
[00:16:58.174 --> 00:17:02.675]  Or they'll even use a cut-out group of real Muslim extremists who think they're actually fighting for Allah.
[00:17:02.675 --> 00:17:06.416]  They will shoot down, they'll probably fire four Stinger missiles.
[00:17:06.416 --> 00:17:07.337]  I don't have a global stopper.
[00:17:07.337 --> 00:17:08.717]  This is how they'll do it.
[00:17:08.717 --> 00:17:10.437]  They'll get outside Dallas or D.C.
[00:17:10.437 --> 00:17:19.040]  or wherever, and they'll pick aircraft taken off with folks going to Europe for a holiday or whatever, and they'll wait until two
[00:17:20.222 --> 00:17:27.545]  Jets take off, they'll have four, because it needs to be spectacular, and they'll shoot them all down right there, and then that'll disappear and they'll find a car.
[00:17:27.545 --> 00:17:29.125]  I say this to ruin their plans.
[00:17:29.125 --> 00:17:32.847]  They'll find a car with all the Arabic and why they did it and everything.
[00:17:32.847 --> 00:17:34.367]  Maybe even blaming it on Iran.
[00:17:34.367 --> 00:17:36.408]  Doesn't matter, Iran's the opposite group.
[00:17:36.408 --> 00:17:42.850]  I've now heard them saying Shiites are really Al Qaeda, and that Iran, I saw that on Fox and CNN yesterday.
[00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.732]  I'm now monitoring enemy transmissions even more because of how they operate.
[00:17:47.631 --> 00:17:49.692]  I can learn a lot because they like to pre-program.
[00:17:49.692 --> 00:17:52.132]  I need the exact pre-programming to understand what they're planning.
[00:17:52.132 --> 00:17:55.253]  Because they talk to you like you're unconscious idiots.
[00:17:55.253 --> 00:17:58.094]  You know, they say, you kept your doctor even though you can't keep it.
[00:17:58.094 --> 00:17:59.975]  This lowered your price even though it increased it.
[00:17:59.975 --> 00:18:00.995]  You didn't build your business.
[00:18:00.995 --> 00:18:02.476]  Raising the debt limit doesn't raise it.
[00:18:02.476 --> 00:18:06.177]  They talk to you like you have a 45 IQ and can't talk.
[00:18:06.177 --> 00:18:08.437]  They talk to you like you're two years old.
[00:18:08.437 --> 00:18:10.118]  Even a two-year-old that has a sermon knows it's a lie.
[00:18:11.232 --> 00:18:23.777]  And so, I'm seeing pre-programming, and I'm telling you, it won't matter when I get up and say, see, I told you, I'll be the traitor who doesn't care about the lives of the dead people.
[00:18:23.777 --> 00:18:29.239]  You know, how dare Alex Jones say the Stinger missile attack on the jet airliners in D.C.
[00:18:29.239 --> 00:18:31.019]  or Dallas or L.A.?
[00:18:31.019 --> 00:18:32.780]  How dare him or Chicago?
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.901]  Because they want a place with a lot of media to cover it the way they want.
[00:18:36.254 --> 00:18:42.618]  How dare him side with Iran and say they didn't do it?
[00:18:42.618 --> 00:18:49.822]  Even though we exposed the chemical weapons attack, three times, that Saudi Arabia launched against Assad to blame him.
[00:18:49.822 --> 00:18:56.426]  Later came out in Cy Hersh, New Yorker Magazine, everywhere, BBC, it was staged, admitted.
[00:18:56.426 --> 00:18:57.227]  With Turkey as well.
[00:18:58.231 --> 00:19:05.019]  So, if I was the globalist, and then I could see all their pre-planning, they're doing exactly what I would do if I was them, you could see the whole thing unfolding.
[00:19:05.019 --> 00:19:07.362]  So let's go ahead and play Megyn Kelly on Fox News.
[00:19:07.362 --> 00:19:09.064]  We've got a bunch of these clips coming up.
[00:19:09.064 --> 00:19:10.726]  Get ready for Stinger Missiles.
[00:19:10.726 --> 00:19:11.667]  Give up all your rights.
[00:19:11.667 --> 00:19:12.007]  Here it is.
[00:19:13.268 --> 00:19:17.990]  Breaking tonight, a troubling report on the terror group now in control of a third of Iraq.
[00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:21.031]  The State Department is now pulling hundreds of staffers from the U.S.
[00:19:21.031 --> 00:19:27.353]  Embassy in Baghdad as this terror group controls more of the territory around the capital city.
[00:19:27.353 --> 00:19:36.196]  Not only are we getting new reports that this group may have executed as many as 1,700 Iraqi security forces in recent days, including in a massacre that
[00:19:36.496 --> 00:19:39.097]  They put online and bragged about.
[00:19:39.097 --> 00:19:46.798]  But today we learned that the same group may now be in possession of a deadly cache of American-made firepower, Stinger missiles.
[00:19:46.798 --> 00:19:49.319]  They are powerful enough to take down a commercial airliner.
[00:19:49.319 --> 00:19:50.579]  We're going to come back with that.
[00:19:50.579 --> 00:19:55.340]  Oh, by the way, because they need that to take out the Iraqi helicopters.
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.701]  So the CIA said, house 5,000 Stingers.
[00:19:59.577 --> 00:20:03.920]  Are you happy doing your laundry with perfume detergents that irritate your skin?
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:08.663]  Are you happy washing your hands with stinking fragrances that gives your skin rashes?

[00:20:58.601 --> 00:21:01.443]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:21:01.443 --> 00:21:06.547]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:21:06.547 --> 00:21:14.673]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:21:14.673 --> 00:21:19.197]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:21:19.197 --> 00:21:23.020]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:29.104]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:21:29.104 --> 00:21:32.286]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:21:32.286 --> 00:21:37.650]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:45.835]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:21:45.835 --> 00:21:46.015]  That's 866-229-0927.
[00:21:56.042 --> 00:22:01.786]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[00:22:01.786 --> 00:22:05.609]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[00:22:05.609 --> 00:22:08.071]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia,
[00:22:08.271 --> 00:22:11.772]  Loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[00:22:11.772 --> 00:22:21.995]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts for 80% of your immune system.
[00:22:21.995 --> 00:22:26.416]  Take back control of your health with Pro-EM1 probiotic from Terraganic.
[00:22:26.656 --> 00:22:36.823]  Pro-EM1 probiotic helps protect your body against irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, diabetes, the common cold, and much more.
[00:22:36.823 --> 00:22:48.310]  And including a powerful probiotic like Pro-EM1 as part of your daily routine puts you back in control and prevents you from becoming a mindless zombie manipulated by the pharmaceutical and GMO agendas.

[00:22:57.998 --> 00:23:02.182]  Hey folks, this is Larry Crisp for BabyBoomerBackupPlan.com.
[00:23:02.182 --> 00:23:05.925]  I don't have to tell you, this economy sucks!
[00:23:05.925 --> 00:23:13.051]  Unlike the political elite and Wall Street bankers, you know that debts don't disappear and bailouts have big consequences.
[00:23:13.451 --> 00:23:20.274]  Stock and real estate market bubbles can pop at any moment and evaporate most or all of your retirement savings.
[00:23:20.274 --> 00:23:24.795]  Folks, we're in the weakest economy of our lifetime and it's likely to get much worse.
[00:23:24.795 --> 00:23:31.138]  Virtually zero sectors of the economy are hiring and workforce participation is at record lows.
[00:23:31.138 --> 00:23:32.138]  And I'm here to tell you
[00:23:32.438 --> 00:23:38.143]  This may be the best thing that could happen to you if you move decidedly and develop a backup plan immediately.
[00:23:38.143 --> 00:23:43.967]  Proportionately more millionaires were created during the Great Depression than at any time in history.
[00:23:43.967 --> 00:23:46.029]  And history is about to repeat itself.
[00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:50.232]  Get my free report at babyboomerbackupplan.com or call 888-507-8789.

[00:24:30.299 --> 00:24:31.620]  Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:31.900]  to 2 p.m.
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:32.220]  Central.
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.101]  We're here live.
[00:24:34.101 --> 00:24:42.504]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:24:45.052 --> 00:24:49.473]  And everybody knows, I told you what Benghazi was about.
[00:24:49.473 --> 00:24:53.154]  It was about plausible deniability.
[00:24:53.154 --> 00:25:09.958]  And I knew 100% last week when I saw a bunch of articles in a major domestic Pentagon push, where they domestically engaged in what was illegal until last year, propaganda, lies, saying, oh, Al-Qaeda and ISIS
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:17.343]  They just got the missiles left in some bases in Iraq.
[00:25:17.343 --> 00:25:19.404]  Uh-huh.
[00:25:19.404 --> 00:25:22.265]  That's right.
[00:25:22.265 --> 00:25:25.206]  And boy, that's why Obama's doing nothing.
[00:25:25.206 --> 00:25:33.730]  But now he sent 200 and something troops to the big giant embassy to make sure Al-Qaeda doesn't get it.
[00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:34.950]  Uh-huh.
[00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:38.072]  Al-Qaeda will probably shoot a few mortars at the base.
[00:25:39.198 --> 00:25:40.779]  In the middle of the night.
[00:25:40.779 --> 00:25:45.081]  And may even kill a few real troops just to make it look like there's a fight going on.
[00:25:45.081 --> 00:25:47.203]  Because the troops don't know it's all staged.
[00:25:47.203 --> 00:25:51.725]  Just like the Al-Qaeda is going to kill U.S.
[00:25:51.725 --> 00:25:54.047]  personnel and contractors.
[00:25:54.047 --> 00:25:55.408]  Because it's real, folks.
[00:25:55.408 --> 00:25:56.468]  It's real wars.
[00:25:56.468 --> 00:26:01.351]  It's just, it's the same group at the top running it to take over nation states.
[00:26:01.351 --> 00:26:06.114]  Because stability and the people and freedom and civilization is the target.
[00:26:07.568 --> 00:26:09.849]  It's called Destabilization.
[00:26:09.849 --> 00:26:18.133]  Zbigniew Brzezinski's written not one, not two, not three, not four, but five books.
[00:26:18.133 --> 00:26:24.556]  And guess who read all five of them?
[00:26:24.556 --> 00:26:27.797]  I read his Technotronic Era when I was 14 years old.
[00:26:31.243 --> 00:26:31.904]  You know why?
[00:26:31.904 --> 00:26:38.068]  Growing up, I wasn't allowed to watch television except watch PBS or Saturday morning cartoons.
[00:26:38.068 --> 00:26:41.891]  And the house was just full of political science books.
[00:26:41.891 --> 00:26:45.093]  And I always thought his books had the coolest covers.
[00:26:45.093 --> 00:26:47.935]  Had all these little squiggly lines and green and yellow shapes.
[00:26:47.935 --> 00:26:49.276]  And I wanted to read it.
[00:26:49.276 --> 00:26:53.580]  I wanted to read The Road to Serfdom.
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:54.420]  I wanted to read all of it.
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:54.961]  You know what I did?
[00:26:56.107 --> 00:26:57.569]  And I guess that's why I'm a weirdo.
[00:26:57.569 --> 00:27:00.552]  See, when I was 14, I wasn't just a bookworm.
[00:27:00.552 --> 00:27:15.588]  I was playing football and dating girls and everything else, but I always wanted to run back at night and stay up late and read Zbigniew Brzezinski, where he admitted the elite run the narcotics and the elite control all the major criminal groups, because that's how we maintain order is by controlling the evil.
[00:27:17.108 --> 00:27:23.151]  And then I read Machiavelli when I was 16, the same year I read Mein Kampf, or My Struggle.
[00:27:23.151 --> 00:27:29.935]  And so, I just had this top political science education by the time I was about 18 years old.
[00:27:29.935 --> 00:27:32.016]  Because it was so entertaining.
[00:27:32.016 --> 00:27:33.777]  I didn't realize what I was even reading at the time.
[00:27:33.777 --> 00:27:36.519]  It was just so interesting.
[00:27:36.519 --> 00:27:41.922]  Mass Executions, Every Other Page, and Order of Death, by Heinz Hubble.
[00:27:41.922 --> 00:27:45.564]  And Page-Turner in Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by Schur.
[00:27:47.247 --> 00:27:49.688]  The Battle for Gaul by Julius Caesar.
[00:27:49.688 --> 00:27:57.893]  I was reading Caesar's words written 2,050-something years ago about out-of-control populations.
[00:27:57.893 --> 00:28:01.915]  And so in high school and college I said, my God, this is everything I read.
[00:28:01.915 --> 00:28:02.756]  They're doing it now.
[00:28:03.777 --> 00:28:09.299]  And public, if you can learn how this stuff works, if I can learn how this works, we can turn this around.
[00:28:09.299 --> 00:28:25.223]  But you must discover how you're controlled, and then you can say they're going to take the Benghazi Stinger missiles, and they're going to hold Europe and the United States hostage, and the elite here are going to take all of our rights in the next phase of Stinger terror.
[00:28:25.223 --> 00:28:30.585]  But only by exposing the enemy's next move can we stop them.
[00:28:32.096 --> 00:28:41.423]  We can pull up the Washington Times two years ago showing Saudi Arabian nationals do not have their burqas taken off and are not searched because they won't have it.
[00:28:41.423 --> 00:28:42.964]  They're not compliant.
[00:28:42.964 --> 00:28:48.909]  Their government controls our government to a great extent.
[00:28:48.909 --> 00:28:54.513]  Only the American people let folks stick their hands in their baby's diaper.
[00:28:56.803 --> 00:29:07.331]  What other country publicly lets their wives be groped by men with perv mustaches and pot bellies?
[00:29:07.331 --> 00:29:09.753]  We're a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:09.753 --> 00:29:14.077]  America was exceptional and I love this country and there's still a lot of exceptionalism left in it.
[00:29:14.077 --> 00:29:22.464]  But the yuppies and the trendies and all the freeloading illegal aliens that hate this country and think everything's free for them and that I'm a racist if I don't
[00:29:23.547 --> 00:29:29.849]  Move 50 people in my house, you can all go straight to hell.
[00:29:29.849 --> 00:29:30.989]  I'm smart.
[00:29:30.989 --> 00:29:32.430]  I know how things work.
[00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:33.530]  I want freedom.
[00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:34.970]  I care about your future.
[00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:36.611]  I know what comes around goes around.
[00:29:36.611 --> 00:29:39.552]  I want all of you to have prosperity.
[00:29:39.552 --> 00:29:40.772]  But I'm going to tell you one thing.
[00:29:40.772 --> 00:29:43.773]  Your ignorance is not an excuse to go along with this.
[00:29:43.773 --> 00:29:46.154]  It isn't a shield against what's about to unfold.
[00:29:46.154 --> 00:29:46.914]  You idiots!
[00:29:48.632 --> 00:29:51.695]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.695 --> 00:29:59.721]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.721 --> 00:30:05.826]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:30:05.826 --> 00:30:10.370]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:14.954]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:30:15.334 --> 00:30:18.257]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:30:18.257 --> 00:30:23.722]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:30:23.722 --> 00:30:31.108]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:30:31.108 --> 00:30:35.252]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:30:35.252 --> 00:30:40.016]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:40.336 --> 00:30:48.965]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:30:48.965 --> 00:30:53.229]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:30:53.229 --> 00:30:58.695]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:30:59.335 --> 00:31:01.578]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:31:01.578 --> 00:31:09.647]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:31:09.647 --> 00:31:16.816]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:31:17.156 --> 00:31:21.759]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[00:31:21.759 --> 00:31:32.407]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:31:32.407 --> 00:31:38.892]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:31:38.892 --> 00:31:41.453]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:31:41.453 --> 00:31:45.096]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[00:31:45.276 --> 00:31:47.199]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[00:31:47.199 --> 00:31:51.385]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.
[00:31:51.385 --> 00:31:58.334]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[00:31:59.155 --> 00:32:05.341]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:32:05.341 --> 00:32:08.625]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:32:08.625 --> 00:32:10.426]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:32:10.426 --> 00:32:16.773]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:32:16.773 --> 00:32:22.679]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[00:32:22.819 --> 00:32:26.761]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:32:26.761 --> 00:32:29.843]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:32:29.843 --> 00:32:38.128]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:32:38.128 --> 00:32:40.209]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:32:40.209 --> 00:32:41.270]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:50.581]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[00:32:50.581 --> 00:32:53.244]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.
[00:32:53.244 --> 00:32:57.530]  Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war to the next level.
[00:33:24.841 --> 00:33:28.023]  We take you live to FEMA Region 6.
[00:33:28.023 --> 00:33:34.528]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:34.528 --> 00:33:36.589]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:40.866 --> 00:34:00.319]  Not only are we getting new reports that this group may have executed as many as 1,700 Iraqi security forces in recent days, including in a massacre that they put online and bragged about, but today we learned that the same group may now be in possession of a deadly cache of American-made firepower, Stinger missiles.
[00:34:00.319 --> 00:34:04.662]  They are powerful enough to take down a commercial airliner.
[00:34:04.662 --> 00:34:07.164]  Well, that's last night, Megyn Kelly.
[00:34:07.164 --> 00:34:08.625]  Ladies and gentlemen, on record,
[00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:27.836]  Saudi Arabia is in their own newspapers, Kurt Nemo's written articles, bragging that this is a holy caliphate of the Sunni, which are the majority of Muslims worldwide, taking over the Shiite nation of Iraq.
[00:34:27.836 --> 00:34:33.098]  And I watched Fareed Zarkaria, the Bilderberg Group member, and I watched them all.
[00:34:33.098 --> 00:34:34.559]  He was on MSNBC this morning.
[00:34:34.559 --> 00:34:37.140]  No, it was CNN.
[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:39.201]  I was on the elliptical, flipping through channels.
[00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:52.819]  Talk about how the leader of Iraq, Maliki, is a thug and a Shiite evil man, and that this is what he basically deserves.
[00:34:52.819 --> 00:35:03.726]  So now Al-Qaeda is the good guy, and the elected government that's been somewhat pro-US, it's been neutral, is now the bad guy.
[00:35:03.726 --> 00:35:07.809]  And then they flip to another guest saying, you better give your rights up, a US senator,
[00:35:11.432 --> 00:35:16.033]  Or, we're going to be hit by terrorists.
[00:35:16.033 --> 00:35:18.753]  Iraq is just like this perpetual war zone.
[00:35:18.753 --> 00:35:26.195]  After they removed Saddam, 23 years ago, they started the war against these people.
[00:35:26.195 --> 00:35:28.775]  Is 100 years of war against Iraq proper?
[00:35:28.775 --> 00:35:29.415]  A thousand?
[00:35:29.415 --> 00:35:30.995]  A million?
[00:35:30.995 --> 00:35:34.076]  Iraq never attacked us.
[00:35:34.076 --> 00:35:40.337]  Iraq was somewhat of a secular nation that the CIA, under another policy, put a stabilizer in, Saddam Hussein.
[00:35:42.961 --> 00:35:45.522]  That's declassified.
[00:35:45.522 --> 00:35:47.924]  Then they set him up.
[00:35:47.924 --> 00:35:50.745]  Told him to invade Kuwait.
[00:35:50.745 --> 00:36:05.894]  And then they've been weakening the country ever since and now they're pouring into the country out of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the giant forces that were in Syria for the three and a half years couldn't beat Assad.
[00:36:05.894 --> 00:36:11.177]  Now they're pouring into the totally infiltrated Iraqi government with CIA,
[00:36:12.967 --> 00:36:30.073]  MI6, contractors, spooks, everywhere, using that embassy to give battle data to Al-Qaeda and its new comic book name ISIS, or ISIS, potato patata, I-S-I-S.
[00:36:30.073 --> 00:36:41.537]  As they fly the bin Laden and Al-Qaeda flags, bigger than Dallas, and as they murder every Christian and every military and every police person they find, these are police people and military people,
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.583]  That were trained on record by our U.S.
[00:36:47.583 --> 00:36:54.809]  military and incredible casualties to stabilize that country after it was destabilized by the West.
[00:36:54.809 --> 00:37:07.018]  And now they're being killed and CNN, Fox and MSNBC all are up there saying, well, the president of Iraq should have just been more pro-West.
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:26.086]  And should have done whatever we said, and maybe now if he behaves, we may give some airstrikes to stop Al-Qaeda that has, or ISIS, that has now surrounded Baghdad.
[00:37:26.086 --> 00:37:36.710]  This would be the equivalent of 200,000 jihadis that have infiltrated the U.S., massing around D.C., attacking and murdering everyone they come across,
[00:37:37.896 --> 00:37:41.477]  And the news goes on and says Obama's been unpopular.
[00:37:41.477 --> 00:37:42.617]  You know, he deserves this.
[00:37:42.617 --> 00:37:44.978]  I mean, that's basically what CNN's saying.
[00:37:44.978 --> 00:37:46.399]  And then they try to make it about Bush.
[00:37:46.399 --> 00:37:49.460]  Bush was a puppet.
[00:37:49.460 --> 00:38:02.904]  Bush was the earlier program to destabilize Iraq and get it ready for Saudi Arabia, who's been softening Iraq up for 22 years.
[00:38:02.904 --> 00:38:05.404]  Where did 15 of the 19 hijackers come from?
[00:38:05.404 --> 00:38:07.345]  Wasn't Iraq, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:17.630]  You'd answer Saudi Arabia on Jeopardy and Alex Trebek would say you answered correctly.
[00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:25.179]  We should have our own Jeopardy show once a month where we actually have real contestants in here and ask them terror questions and have big prizes.
[00:38:25.179 --> 00:38:28.583]  How about the grand winner each time for an hour show gets $5,000?
[00:38:30.913 --> 00:38:33.474]  We could even have people Skype in, maybe, as contestants.
[00:38:33.474 --> 00:38:40.779]  You know, they enter a lottery, they Skype in, like, ten different Skype people, and I sit there and, like Jeopardy!, and, you know, ask them, let's start easy.
[00:38:40.779 --> 00:38:45.141]  Oh, you picked a false flag stage terror destabilization group.
[00:38:45.141 --> 00:38:48.023]  All right, number one.
[00:38:48.023 --> 00:38:49.744]  What year was the Gulf of Tonkin?
[00:38:49.744 --> 00:38:49.944]  Bing, 1964.
[00:38:49.944 --> 00:38:50.284]  Correct.
[00:38:50.284 --> 00:38:53.426]  In the same category.
[00:38:53.426 --> 00:38:53.686]  Bing.
[00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:06.755]  What year was the USS Maine destroyed, starting the Spanish-American War?
[00:39:06.755 --> 00:39:07.135]  Bing!
[00:39:07.135 --> 00:39:07.876]  1898.
[00:39:07.876 --> 00:39:11.378]  You have to answer in the form of a question.
[00:39:11.378 --> 00:39:12.319]  Yeah, in the answer form of a question.
[00:39:12.319 --> 00:39:13.020]  I don't watch the show.
[00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:15.001]  You'll have to give me all the stuff.
[00:39:15.001 --> 00:39:20.905]  Next thing, they'll sit there and go to the next question.
[00:39:20.905 --> 00:39:22.006]  There you go.
[00:39:22.006 --> 00:39:24.628]  For the Daily Double, doesn't that mean it's associated with the last question?
[00:39:26.553 --> 00:39:29.575]  Who was president in 1898 when the U.S.
[00:39:29.575 --> 00:39:33.497]  government staged the false flag, launching that war?
[00:39:33.497 --> 00:39:35.719]  Who is William McKinley?
[00:39:35.719 --> 00:39:42.903]  You are correct!
[00:39:42.903 --> 00:39:43.404]  Good.
[00:39:43.404 --> 00:39:45.285]  Now, let's continue in the false flag category.
[00:39:45.285 --> 00:39:46.245]  Can we do that again, please?
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:48.581]  All right.
[00:39:48.581 --> 00:39:49.141]  Continuing.
[00:39:49.141 --> 00:39:49.762]  You're doing really good.
[00:39:49.762 --> 00:39:52.204]  Wow, you've got a lot of money up there on the board.
[00:39:52.204 --> 00:39:55.947]  Let's move on now to another question.
[00:39:55.947 --> 00:39:57.008]  Bing.
[00:39:57.008 --> 00:39:57.968]  Ah.
[00:39:57.968 --> 00:39:59.750]  ISIS.
[00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:01.932]  ISIS.
[00:40:01.932 --> 00:40:08.197]  What Muslim group founded and runs this organization?
[00:40:08.197 --> 00:40:09.017]  Bing.
[00:40:09.017 --> 00:40:10.719]  Oh, you know the answer already.
[00:40:10.719 --> 00:40:14.862]  That would be Al-Qaeda.
[00:40:14.862 --> 00:40:15.442]  Good answer.
[00:40:15.442 --> 00:40:15.783]  You win.
[00:40:16.715 --> 00:40:18.976]  All right, let's move along.
[00:40:18.976 --> 00:40:20.536]  The next question.
[00:40:20.536 --> 00:40:34.681]  Which country founded and runs Al-Qaeda and in 1901 launched the attack from a small Bedouin-held territory to take over most of the Middle East and was backed by British intelligence?
[00:40:34.681 --> 00:40:35.061]  Bing!
[00:40:35.061 --> 00:40:37.041]  You've already got the answer?
[00:40:37.041 --> 00:40:38.422]  What is Saudi Arabia?
[00:40:42.837 --> 00:40:44.478]  All right, the final question.
[00:40:44.478 --> 00:40:46.299]  You get a super bonus.
[00:40:46.299 --> 00:40:48.560]  Fans of Jeffrey will get mad, because I don't even know the show very well.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.501]  It's just, I'm way in there.
[00:40:50.501 --> 00:40:52.202]  The next question, final.
[00:40:52.202 --> 00:40:55.184]  What's the big bonus when you get the whole group right?
[00:40:55.184 --> 00:40:58.646]  What's that called?
[00:40:58.646 --> 00:41:06.230]  Point is, you're going to win $10,000 if you get this next one right.
[00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:08.892]  Which Western intelligence group
[00:41:10.493 --> 00:41:19.297]  Established the original Bedouin tribes into a military force to destabilize and take over the entire region in 1901.
[00:41:19.297 --> 00:41:19.817]  Beep.
[00:41:19.817 --> 00:41:23.118]  You've already got the answer?
[00:41:23.118 --> 00:41:25.159]  Why, yes I do.
[00:41:25.159 --> 00:41:28.680]  That would be British Intelligence.
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.461]  Incredible.
[00:41:30.461 --> 00:41:34.043]  Wow, you've just won that entire category.
[00:41:34.043 --> 00:41:37.544]  Now, next up, snuff films of children.
[00:41:37.544 --> 00:41:39.945]  You know what?
[00:41:40.956 --> 00:41:49.083]  And we can have, when I do this and the answers, we'll provide documentation for each answer to show everyone, this is the way to reach the general public.
[00:41:49.083 --> 00:41:52.166]  I've been realizing that we need to do it entertainment style.
[00:41:52.166 --> 00:41:54.568]  And I should do a show once a week where I endorse the whole New World Order.
[00:41:54.568 --> 00:42:00.132]  I'm gonna go, so they found a couple thousand dead toddler Irish kids.
[00:42:01.053 --> 00:42:10.575]  To show the photos of the sweet little children who had nothing even wrong with them and they injected them with experimental vaccines to kill them on purpose and put them in a septic tank.
[00:42:10.575 --> 00:42:11.455]  And I'll go, what's that?
[00:42:11.455 --> 00:42:14.535]  And I'll go, it's cleaning up those subhumans!
[00:42:14.535 --> 00:42:16.936]  Yeah!
[00:42:16.936 --> 00:42:18.356]  Yeah!
[00:42:18.356 --> 00:42:28.618]  And in New York State, what year did CPS workers blow the whistle on black children being fed pesticides until they died by a major agri-company?
[00:42:30.421 --> 00:42:31.822]  Why?
[00:42:31.822 --> 00:42:33.863]  You guessed right!
[00:42:33.863 --> 00:42:35.944]  2005 New York Daily News!
[00:42:35.944 --> 00:42:38.065]  In the form of an answer though!
[00:42:38.065 --> 00:42:39.446]  Oh, you say you've got it in the form of an answer?
[00:42:39.446 --> 00:42:40.706]  What is it?
[00:42:40.706 --> 00:42:43.808]  What is New York State?
[00:42:43.808 --> 00:42:48.910]  Correct answer!
[00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:52.112]  Let's move on with torture of children in snuff films.
[00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:55.641]  With the next question, it's a little harder.
[00:42:55.641 --> 00:43:10.407]  Which CIA psychiatrist for more than 40 years, tortured and mind-controlled, including sexual exploitation of small children, grabbed out of their backyards at CIA bases in Maryland and in Canada?
[00:43:10.407 --> 00:43:11.867]  I gave you a lot of info there.
[00:43:11.867 --> 00:43:13.748]  Who is it?
[00:43:13.748 --> 00:43:15.629]  You say you've already got the answer?
[00:43:15.629 --> 00:43:17.770]  Who is Dr. Ewing Cameron?
[00:43:18.706 --> 00:43:19.407]  Oh my gosh!
[00:43:19.407 --> 00:43:20.487]  Bing bing bing!
[00:43:20.487 --> 00:43:21.708]  Daily Double!
[00:43:21.708 --> 00:43:24.411]  Next up is the same association as this one.
[00:43:24.411 --> 00:43:35.800]  Who was his main protégé, who was also Tim McVeigh, the bombing patsy's main adjunct, and who was in the CIA MKUltra hearings?
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:39.102]  You have the answer?
[00:43:39.102 --> 00:43:40.083]  Yes.
[00:43:40.083 --> 00:43:42.905]  Who is psychiatrist Jolian West?
[00:43:42.905 --> 00:43:43.526]  Correct!
[00:43:49.173 --> 00:43:53.437]  Is that enough InfoWars Jeopardy for everybody?
[00:43:53.437 --> 00:44:11.932]  We should trust the government, we should take all the shots they give us, and eat the GMO food, even though all these top scientists have gone public saying they were hired, I've had them on the show, to design a potato in England, you name it, to sterilize people, but only a certain portion, so that no one could tell it was the potato directly.
[00:44:11.932 --> 00:44:14.214]  And they hit you from so many other angles, they end up getting everybody.
[00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:26.233]  Guys, I'm thinking we should call it, like, even though it's a parody, we can get away with doing it, we should call it something like, like, Punkity.
[00:44:26.233 --> 00:44:32.595]  Instead of Jeopardy, you know, we're a punk nation of slaves, little pup of anything, so we'll call the show, I Got Punked!
[00:44:34.554 --> 00:44:35.715]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:44:35.715 --> 00:44:36.895]  Thank you to I Got Punk.
[00:44:36.895 --> 00:44:44.459]  This is to honor the nation of sheep who, well, like punks in prison, love to get beat up every day and forced to bend over.
[00:44:44.459 --> 00:44:48.781]  It'd be easier to stand up and fight, but they want the hard road of being a slave.
[00:44:48.781 --> 00:44:51.342]  So to all the slaves out there, you want it?
[00:44:51.342 --> 00:44:53.863]  You want a kick in the teeth every minute on the minute?
[00:44:53.863 --> 00:44:54.844]  You're gonna get it.
[00:44:54.844 --> 00:44:56.945]  The road to serfdom is for you.
[00:44:56.945 --> 00:45:00.327]  I think I need to stop right now.
[00:45:00.327 --> 00:45:00.447]  See?
[00:45:01.926 --> 00:45:05.188]  I get a little down sometimes about everything, like I was yesterday.
[00:45:05.188 --> 00:45:11.312]  And then I just kind of rebound with the sarcasticness like I'm doing right now.
[00:45:11.312 --> 00:45:19.337]  I bet all you FBI guys and Secret Service guys and military people, I bet you think you're going to be real safe in this system where everybody gets backstabbed.
[00:45:19.337 --> 00:45:24.980]  Actually, the military and police people are waking up because they realize this is going to a really bad place.
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:26.941]  I wonder what's happening to the general public, though.
[00:45:26.941 --> 00:45:27.762]  Do they have any idea that
[00:45:28.442 --> 00:45:36.805]  It's admitted that Obama ordered the attack on anybody who was pro-freedom with the IRS that's totally beyond Richard Nixon times a thousand.
[00:45:36.805 --> 00:45:41.367]  And now they claim all the emails have been erased now that Congress is forcing the subpoena.
[00:45:41.367 --> 00:45:47.229]  IRS loses emails from six more involved in targeting in different email systems.
[00:45:47.229 --> 00:45:52.851]  And of course the head of the environmental grab, she got caught in subpoenas lying about emails and had fake emails.
[00:45:58.467 --> 00:45:59.468]  Isn't that just sweet?
[00:45:59.468 --> 00:46:01.510]  Isn't that just cute, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:02.751]  Isn't that just special?
[00:46:02.751 --> 00:46:04.473]  And the dollar is plunging in value.
[00:46:04.473 --> 00:46:08.397]  Price of meat, chicken, fish soars to all-time high.
[00:46:10.561 --> 00:46:18.644]  On dollar devaluation, and also they've rigged now by getting most of the food produced outside the country.
[00:46:18.644 --> 00:46:21.225]  50 years ago we could feed the whole world, literally.
[00:46:21.225 --> 00:46:32.329]  Now they've scammed the markets, the meatpacking so much that they've set it up where you can't produce chicken, turkey, fish farm, fish, beef, and make a living in most cases.
[00:46:32.329 --> 00:46:33.549]  It's not very profitable.
[00:46:33.549 --> 00:46:34.549]  Put it to you that way.
[00:46:34.549 --> 00:46:38.991]  If you're an actual producer, unless you're a big agribusiness, they're giving all the loopholes and tax exemptions.
[00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:43.431]  And all the taxpayer money.
[00:46:43.431 --> 00:46:45.592]  The little guy doesn't get all that.
[00:46:45.592 --> 00:46:46.912]  The corporate welfare.
[00:46:46.912 --> 00:46:54.915]  And so as most of the ranchers shut down, the small chicken producers shut down, you're going to find out what it's like and I hope everybody enjoys it.
[00:46:54.915 --> 00:47:00.376]  But on top of all of that, because we don't want that freeloader Bundy, whose family's been on that land since 1877.
[00:47:04.111 --> 00:47:05.612]  1878.
[00:47:05.612 --> 00:47:08.154]  Six generations, seven generations.
[00:47:08.154 --> 00:47:12.438]  They've run out all the other 30-something ranching families that came there on wagon trains.
[00:47:12.438 --> 00:47:19.044]  But don't worry, he'll shut down and then he'll show that lazy freeloader.
[00:47:19.044 --> 00:47:20.405]  And then who can pay the taxes?
[00:47:20.405 --> 00:47:28.172]  All the BLM and their little army outfits, who can't wait to have a war with the Tea Party.
[00:47:28.172 --> 00:47:29.273]  They're all so tough, you know.
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:33.422]  They're all big, big, big, tough commandos.
[00:47:33.422 --> 00:47:40.925]  By the way, there's a video up on InfoWars.com and DrugsReport.com is linked to the story from yesterday.
[00:47:40.925 --> 00:47:45.488]  In the middle column, churches caught shipping illegals into the country.
[00:47:45.488 --> 00:47:52.611]  And, you know, I saw some of the trolls in the comments saying it wasn't true and stuff and our story got picked up by hundreds of other publications and I went and looked at some of those.
[00:47:52.611 --> 00:47:56.213]  The talking point is, oh, these are just kids that got off buses
[00:47:57.461 --> 00:47:59.322]  And teenagers and their moms and babies.
[00:47:59.322 --> 00:48:01.603]  And so the church has waited at the border to be nice.
[00:48:01.603 --> 00:48:20.210]  No, we went and found the churches, public statements, the Catholic churches, the evangelical churches, all Democratic Party front grips, 501c3, getting taxpayer money and getting Ford Foundation money in their own words to stage the illegals coming in and the Border Patrol being told to stand down.
[00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:21.710]  And guess what the Border Patrol did?
[00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:25.312]  They came over and got in our reporters' faces yesterday
[00:48:29.065 --> 00:48:32.408]  And so that's the big news.
[00:48:32.408 --> 00:48:34.189]  And our guys shot a report about it.
[00:48:34.189 --> 00:48:36.011]  So we've got them coming up in the third hour.
[00:48:36.011 --> 00:48:38.052]  They're going to have that video.
[00:48:38.052 --> 00:48:42.616]  Jakari mentions it in another report, talking about Border Patrol powerless.
[00:48:42.616 --> 00:48:43.417]  And that's interesting.
[00:48:43.417 --> 00:48:53.225]  But the headline is Border Patrol tries to stop press from reporting on collapsed border.
[00:48:53.225 --> 00:48:54.225]  Because that's what happened.
[00:48:54.225 --> 00:48:54.826]  I've talked to them.
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:58.421]  But that's how nice my reporters are.
[00:48:58.421 --> 00:48:58.801]  Oh, really?
[00:48:58.801 --> 00:49:00.681]  We're being harassed by the Border Patrol?
[00:49:00.681 --> 00:49:03.322]  Literally down there showing the illegals being let in.
[00:49:03.322 --> 00:49:04.563]  Of course!
[00:49:04.563 --> 00:49:06.963]  The press is the enemy in something like this.
[00:49:06.963 --> 00:49:11.805]  And I'm not trying to get in a fight with the Border Patrol, but you've got a bunch of political people on the Border Patrol now.
[00:49:11.805 --> 00:49:17.007]  You know, the head of it people are former Ford Foundation heads who've sworn to destroy this country.
[00:49:17.007 --> 00:49:25.610]  And so they're following orders to change diapers, heat up milk for the babies, get them on the buses, and get them deeper into the U.S., where they promptly become citizens.
[00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:26.270]  And Obama
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:29.601]  I'm going to cover this after the break.
[00:49:29.601 --> 00:49:34.822]  He is running around honoring illegal immigrant children this week.
[00:49:34.822 --> 00:49:36.623]  That's to encourage them up here.
[00:49:36.623 --> 00:49:39.344]  And then acting like, oh, we don't know why there's a flood.
[00:49:39.344 --> 00:49:42.505]  And now that the word's here that you get here, everything's free.
[00:49:42.505 --> 00:49:43.905]  I've got articles coming up.
[00:49:43.905 --> 00:49:48.947]  I'll show you photos in mainstream news of like women with babies hanging off of them.
[00:49:48.947 --> 00:49:49.907]  Totally dependent.
[00:49:49.907 --> 00:49:52.528]  I mean, the country is being sunk.
[00:49:52.528 --> 00:49:54.729]  I've studied military history, folks, but anybody can figure this out.
[00:49:55.933 --> 00:50:07.164]  When they turn off half the power plants in the country, as they're now doing, they've shut a third of them down, they're shutting down the other two-thirds of the 50% they swore to do, that's a military attack.
[00:50:07.164 --> 00:50:10.568]  It'll cost money for everything else you do, like meat that's exploding.
[00:50:12.011 --> 00:50:17.197]  When they ship your jobs overseas with incentives where it's impossible to have a factory here in the U.S.
[00:50:17.197 --> 00:50:21.282]  unless you're an insider, that's called deindustrialization economic warfare.
[00:50:21.282 --> 00:50:26.829]  When you ship in tens of millions of illegals to get freebies and to vote to take the rights of the people, that's an economic takeover.
[00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:28.591]  This is a military takeover.
[00:50:28.591 --> 00:50:30.133]  They use Al Qaeda to take down Iraq.
[00:50:30.874 --> 00:50:32.495]  Protect down Libya or Syria?
[00:50:32.495 --> 00:50:36.156]  They use economic warfare on us.
[00:50:36.156 --> 00:50:39.637]  And people that understand it can thrive in this environment, but most people can't.
[00:50:39.637 --> 00:50:44.298]  Most people are caught flat-footed, and they're bringing us down right now.
[00:50:44.298 --> 00:50:46.919]  What comes next to get us behind the government?
[00:50:46.919 --> 00:50:48.760]  Nukes going off.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:50.160]  Airplanes being shot down.
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.021]  Remember what Obama said after I warned?
[00:50:52.021 --> 00:50:57.183]  His main fear is a nuke going off in New York.
[00:50:57.183 --> 00:50:58.323]  I'm telling you, they'll do it.

[00:52:01.826 --> 00:52:07.872]  I'm here with Dr. Edward Group, Master Herbologist and Chief Formulator behind the InfoWarsLife products.
[00:52:07.872 --> 00:52:12.336]  Dr. Group, what have you been hearing from women who've started taking Super Female Vitality?
[00:52:12.336 --> 00:52:18.822]  You know, we've heard the reviews and feedback from Super Male Vitality from emails to even excited callers on the radio.
[00:52:19.102 --> 00:52:21.064]  Now, the answer for women is here.
[00:52:21.064 --> 00:52:32.555]  A new formulation specifically designed for the female body, Super Female Vitality, delivers 10 key herbs that work synergistically to revitalize the unique biology of women.
[00:52:32.555 --> 00:52:34.576]  I'm so glad that you guys made this for women.
[00:52:34.576 --> 00:52:40.202]  When he brought me home, the bottle, Super Female, had tons of energy, tons of motivation, a lot of drive.
[00:52:40.202 --> 00:52:42.023]  My husband thinks I've been in a better mood.
[00:52:42.023 --> 00:52:43.825]  Our relationship, all I can say is, it's a lot better now.
[00:52:44.145 --> 00:52:48.429]  I've just started taking Super Female Vitality from InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:52:58.558 --> 00:53:03.462]  How long would you last if all grocery stores ceased to exist?
[00:53:03.462 --> 00:53:04.383]  Not in America.
[00:53:04.383 --> 00:53:06.184]  This can't happen in America.
[00:53:06.184 --> 00:53:07.866]  Because of my concern about our government.
[00:53:08.422 --> 00:53:10.224]  I was looking at survival stuff.
[00:53:10.224 --> 00:53:13.707]  I was raised as a Girl Scout and their motto was to be prepared.
[00:53:13.707 --> 00:53:18.971]  Suit for Patriots was an opportunity for me to be able to put some things aside.
[00:53:18.971 --> 00:53:22.894]  I said, well, this is a product worth having, even as it's so good.
[00:53:22.894 --> 00:53:25.877]  I like the pricing for what I got.
[00:53:25.877 --> 00:53:28.259]  I like the containers they were shipped in.
[00:53:28.259 --> 00:53:29.500]  They keep in touch with you.
[00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:31.822]  You get your emails, you get your confirmations.
[00:53:31.822 --> 00:53:35.405]  The customer service is just absolutely fantastic.
[00:53:35.945 --> 00:53:39.907]  I plan on buying probably about four more of these minimum.
[00:53:39.907 --> 00:53:42.729]  And this just came so quick, it came right when they said it would come.
[00:53:42.729 --> 00:53:48.872]  Thanks for supplying all this stuff for us, because I think we're all going to be needing it in a very short time.
[00:53:48.872 --> 00:53:52.695]  Join over 50,000 Americans who have trusted Food for Patriots.

[00:53:59.879 --> 00:54:05.342]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:17.392 --> 00:54:17.997]  Yeah.
[00:54:29.767 --> 00:54:44.916]  So, I want to open the phones up about ISIS and the globalist shadow army descending over the Middle East, engaging in extermination of Christians everywhere, which is the stated goal of the so-called leftists that run our government, who aren't real leftists.
[00:54:44.916 --> 00:54:50.900]  I know plenty of hippies, plenty of folks that are into organic food, that are wonderful, great people.
[00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:54.922]  You know, they're buying milk from the Amish and care about freedom and own guns.
[00:54:54.922 --> 00:54:57.424]  There's like a hippie Texan type that is great people.
[00:54:58.211 --> 00:55:12.961]  But the globalists pose as trendy hippies and as, quote, you know, progressive loving people when they are nothing but a group of social engineering tyrants who are a totally parasitic group.
[00:55:12.961 --> 00:55:17.904]  Now, I want to get into all the articles that are up on InfoWars.com and take your calls on ISIS,
[00:55:19.215 --> 00:55:23.479]  And what's happening over there and the demonization of the Iraqi government on all the channels.
[00:55:23.479 --> 00:55:24.920]  Well, he's a bad guy.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:26.421]  He didn't include people.
[00:55:26.421 --> 00:55:34.407]  So it's good to have an army out of Saudi Arabia that massed in controlled areas of Jordan and Syria.
[00:55:34.407 --> 00:55:36.890]  Come in and murder everybody.
[00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:39.051]  And Fareed Zarkaria was smiling.
[00:55:39.051 --> 00:55:40.833]  He's so evil looking.
[00:55:40.833 --> 00:55:42.754]  Smiling and giggling about it.
[00:55:42.754 --> 00:55:44.236]  Getting off on the power.
[00:55:44.236 --> 00:55:46.978]  Like Hillary going, I came, I saw, he died.
[00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:57.598]  I mean, if some commando would have broken, cut off his neck, there's a military code with real killers that they don't brag about it.
[00:55:57.598 --> 00:55:59.820]  A, it's bad luck.
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:01.821]  B, it's unseemly.
[00:56:01.821 --> 00:56:05.305]  C, you don't want folks coming after you because you've killed people.
[00:56:06.149 --> 00:56:09.812]  D, when you're a tough guy and people know it, other tough guys want to fight you.
[00:56:09.812 --> 00:56:19.840]  I could keep going on the list of why no one in history gets up on TV, or in newspapers, or in print, or on a speech that says, I killed Gaddafi!
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:29.428]  And it's some ugly, crone, evil woman who didn't do jack crap, who lied about herself being in an aircraft shot up over Serbia.
[00:56:29.428 --> 00:56:30.269]  Remember that loadable?
[00:56:31.878 --> 00:56:43.302]  They were sitting on flak jackets as they flew into the combat zone.
[00:56:43.302 --> 00:56:48.744]  I've got a cousin who's been in the military 31 years, and I asked him, he's been over 20 combat tours.
[00:56:48.744 --> 00:56:50.444]  He won't tell you anything.
[00:56:50.444 --> 00:56:52.325]  No stories, no nothing.
[00:56:52.325 --> 00:56:58.027]  Except about people burning up their own kids and stuff and why he hates, why he hates Al-Qaeda type people so much.
[00:57:01.072 --> 00:57:03.453]  And then meanwhile you got Hillary Clinton talking about how tough she is.
[00:57:03.453 --> 00:57:06.554]  I mean, this is a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:06.554 --> 00:57:07.535]  So that's all coming up.
[00:57:07.535 --> 00:57:12.797]  Up on InfoWars.com, established church groups aiding illegal immigrant invasion of U.S.
[00:57:12.797 --> 00:57:25.422]  Paul Watson Alex Jones article, proving the article that's up on DrudgeReport.com, where we show the church admitting they're shipping them in, but this is in their own words in mainstream news the last three years, saying this was the plan.
[00:57:27.059 --> 00:57:31.781]  This is a concerted nationwide plan, on record, to totally take down the country.
[00:57:31.781 --> 00:57:37.042]  Paul Watson and I prove it in this key article, read linked on Infowars.com.
[00:57:37.042 --> 00:57:42.824]  Largest gas pipeline serving Europe, that's to make Europe buy globalist gas, blows up in Ukraine.
[00:57:42.824 --> 00:57:45.165]  World War III is starting folks, it's proxy wars.
[00:57:45.165 --> 00:57:47.426]  What's wrong with these two headlines?
[00:57:47.426 --> 00:57:49.887]  Cop punches woman in the stomach, crowd outraged.
[00:57:51.946 --> 00:57:53.708]  It's all coming up in the next hour.
[00:57:53.708 --> 00:57:55.810]  I'm going to get into all of it and take your phone calls.

[00:58:52.382 --> 00:58:59.806]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[00:58:59.806 --> 00:59:10.634]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[00:59:10.634 --> 00:59:19.880]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:24.662]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[00:59:24.662 --> 00:59:28.423]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[00:59:28.423 --> 00:59:30.484]  Experience the new formula.
[00:59:30.484 --> 00:59:33.065]  Experience the ancient purity.

[00:59:52.253 --> 00:59:54.660]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:57.429]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.336 --> 01:00:10.179]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.179 --> 01:00:11.780]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:13.320]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:17.503]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.503 --> 01:00:21.605]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:36.556 --> 01:00:40.121]  Alright, this is Jakari Jackson's report filed this morning.
[01:00:40.121 --> 01:00:41.102]  We're going to get to it in a moment.
[01:00:41.102 --> 01:00:47.351]  Then I'm going to come back in the next segment, recap the top stories, get to some other news I haven't covered, and start taking your phone calls.
[01:00:49.239 --> 01:00:56.345]  On ISIS, or ISIS, that is an Al-Qaeda Saudi Arabian military, that's admitted.
[01:00:56.345 --> 01:01:06.133]  They've got heat-seeking missiles, Stinger missiles, given to them by the globalists, by the CIA, by British intelligence, by Turkish intelligence, by Saudi Arabian operations.
[01:01:06.974 --> 01:01:08.296]  To destabilize the whole area.
[01:01:08.296 --> 01:01:11.380]  And they're now saying they've got to take our rights on the news.
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:14.564]  America will be hit by ISIS.
[01:01:14.564 --> 01:01:18.009]  And the neocons are all very proud of themselves, knowing how stupid the public is.
[01:01:18.009 --> 01:01:20.472]  Going, see, we've got to take your rights now.
[01:01:20.472 --> 01:01:22.095]  When they run the army doing this.
[01:01:23.888 --> 01:01:25.628]  And it doesn't mean this army won't kill U.S.
[01:01:25.628 --> 01:01:28.589]  soldiers, of course!
[01:01:28.589 --> 01:01:36.351]  It's like in Braveheart, which is based on a true story, those battles really happen, where Longshanks the King says, fire with archers into the whole army fighting.
[01:01:36.351 --> 01:01:39.032]  He goes, sir, but there's a battle, we'll kill our people.
[01:01:39.032 --> 01:01:43.954]  And he goes, we'll get some of theirs too!
[01:01:43.954 --> 01:01:46.474]  It isn't about, it's about getting everybody.
[01:01:46.474 --> 01:01:52.476]  So here's Jakari Jackson's report, and the Border Patrol followed him around and harassed him, so they're doing something about the illegals, here it is.
[01:01:59.619 --> 01:02:01.741]  This is Jakari Jackson for InfoWars.com.
[01:02:01.741 --> 01:02:09.349]  We're on the Texas-Mexico border investigating what could be considered an invasion of the United States of America by Central American immigrants.
[01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:11.871]  You say, well maybe invasion is too strong of a word.
[01:02:11.871 --> 01:02:15.555]  Well, let's take a look at some of these words from the Border Patrol agents themselves.
[01:02:15.555 --> 01:02:16.296]  We have this article.
[01:02:16.636 --> 01:02:19.819]  Ex-Border Patrol agents, immigrant flood orchestrated.
[01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:31.128]  And in this article, these Border Patrol agents, they're talking about how this is a very intentional thing done by the Obama administration, preying on the well-meaning good wishes of the American people.
[01:02:31.128 --> 01:02:40.315]  Because you have church groups and other people that pick up these people at the bus stations, they give them a hot bath, they give them a hot meal, then loose them back onto the streets of America.
[01:02:40.775 --> 01:02:46.838]  But you have to consider that many of the people that are coming here, this has been reported in Breitbart, are gang affiliated.
[01:02:46.838 --> 01:02:58.024]  These are people sometimes who have diseases and they're coming here to the United States of America, not as if we don't have our own health concerns and also safety risks with the gangs we already have here in the States.
[01:02:58.524 --> 01:03:08.231]  And the thing that concerns me about this is because we see border patrol agents and they're concerned about what we're doing as journalists, not concerned so much about what the illegal immigrants are doing.
[01:03:08.231 --> 01:03:14.215]  And I'm saying to these guys, you know, if you really want to catch these illegal immigrants, why are you out here worrying about what we're doing?
[01:03:14.215 --> 01:03:18.718]  Why don't you go to some of these army bases, some of these other facilities that are housing these people illegally?
[01:03:19.198 --> 01:03:27.981]  We see, for example, back in 2009, a California county spent $64 million providing welfare assistance to these illegal immigrants.
[01:03:27.981 --> 01:03:36.283]  So this is very much a financial concern, not just the safety risk of gangs or the health risk of the diseases, but now you have another concern as well.
[01:03:36.283 --> 01:03:39.224]  So this is something that we've been documenting for a while now.
[01:03:39.224 --> 01:03:43.966]  As you recall, last week, Kit Daniels and also Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, they were investigating
[01:03:44.466 --> 01:03:47.168]  Yeah, and I think I'm going to have the guys just stay there basically all week.
[01:04:11.058 --> 01:04:14.801]  I mean, if they're up for it, and they always are, I think they should stay until Friday.
[01:04:14.801 --> 01:04:24.469]  And boy, they're getting whistleblower ICE people, Border Patrol, they're getting all sorts of stuff that is unbelievable to actually see it.
[01:04:24.469 --> 01:04:32.335]  And those reports are going to be getting filed over the next few days at Infowars.com, at PrisonPlanet.com, and if you go up to Infowars.com,
[01:04:34.645 --> 01:04:35.765]  It's proof.
[01:04:35.765 --> 01:04:38.906]  We have their own admissions, and the video, and the church is admitting it.
[01:04:38.906 --> 01:04:41.507]  It is an orchestrated, planned program.
[01:04:41.507 --> 01:04:42.968]  The Bar Brazil doesn't stop the buses.
[01:04:42.968 --> 01:04:44.508]  The buses are brought in.
[01:04:44.508 --> 01:04:49.890]  The men, women, and children are brought by orders of Obama and shipped in in total felonies.
[01:04:49.890 --> 01:04:56.812]  Each action confirmed with the quotes by the churches, Catholic Church, you name it, bragging how they've done it.
[01:04:56.812 --> 01:04:57.853]  This is a total takeover.
[01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:03.644]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:05:03.644 --> 01:05:08.008]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:05:08.008 --> 01:05:11.671]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:05:11.671 --> 01:05:14.694]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:05:14.694 --> 01:05:22.281]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:05:22.281 --> 01:05:25.924]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:05:26.184 --> 01:05:30.586]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:05:30.586 --> 01:05:36.568]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:05:36.568 --> 01:05:40.510]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:43.251]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:05:43.251 --> 01:05:44.752]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:05:44.752 --> 01:05:46.112]  It's time to take action.
[01:05:46.112 --> 01:05:47.933]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:06:00.808 --> 01:06:02.149]  In the near future.
[01:06:02.149 --> 01:06:06.633]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:06:06.633 --> 01:06:07.854]  Security alert.
[01:06:07.854 --> 01:06:09.875]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:06:09.875 --> 01:06:13.438]  Analysis, InfoWars, building independent media operation.
[01:06:13.438 --> 01:06:18.462]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:06:18.462 --> 01:06:21.044]  Crime directive, discredit Alex Jones.
[01:06:21.044 --> 01:06:23.907]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:06:23.907 --> 01:06:27.129]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:06:27.129 --> 01:06:29.291]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:06:29.431 --> 01:06:30.931]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:06:30.931 --> 01:06:33.792]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:06:33.792 --> 01:06:35.733]  They are never going to stop.
[01:06:35.733 --> 01:06:39.754]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:06:39.754 --> 01:06:43.355]  Block free iPhone app at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:43.355 --> 01:06:46.716]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[01:06:46.716 --> 01:06:47.696]  Imperative.
[01:06:47.696 --> 01:06:49.657]  Deploy civil senate TV.
[01:06:49.657 --> 01:06:54.218]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:06:54.218 --> 01:06:55.799]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:06:55.799 --> 01:06:56.539]  You can feel it.
[01:06:59.451 --> 01:07:04.432]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[01:07:04.432 --> 01:07:07.773]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[01:07:07.773 --> 01:07:09.894]  She's just not the woman I married.
[01:07:09.894 --> 01:07:12.035]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[01:07:12.035 --> 01:07:13.695]  Does this seem familiar?
[01:07:13.695 --> 01:07:17.016]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[01:07:17.016 --> 01:07:18.596]  If so, consider this.
[01:07:18.596 --> 01:07:27.519]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[01:07:27.899 --> 01:07:34.267]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[01:07:34.267 --> 01:07:36.329]  Forget synthetic chemicals.
[01:07:36.329 --> 01:07:43.958]  Super Female Vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives.

[01:07:57.544 --> 01:08:02.366]  Live life healthy.
[01:08:02.366 --> 01:08:08.989]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.989 --> 01:08:11.991]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.539 --> 01:08:19.703]  I've been saying to you, coming to you from Occupied, FEMA Region 6 for about 18 years.
[01:08:19.703 --> 01:08:21.745]  It's directly out of Red Dawn.
[01:08:23.148 --> 01:08:27.331]  For all of those on or behind the lines, this song is for you.
[01:08:27.331 --> 01:08:30.573]  And then they had an old promo on Genesis about 18 years ago.
[01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:35.296]  We ought to find that where it then came in with the music and my voice.
[01:08:35.296 --> 01:08:49.665]  So that's why we have those liners the last decade or so, that one you just heard, where we say from deep behind enemy lines, we are in occupied FEMA Region 6 New World Order corporate control system.
[01:08:49.665 --> 01:08:51.586]  Anti-free market, anti-family,
[01:08:53.231 --> 01:08:55.152]  Anti-freedom.
[01:08:55.152 --> 01:08:59.795]  They want total monopoly, a total plastic synthetic culture.
[01:08:59.795 --> 01:09:11.543]  So that we'll be pliably, incrementally reduced as the age of the machines rises, towards the age of the transhumanist, in their own words, in quadruplicate.
[01:09:11.543 --> 01:09:13.424]  And they're following their plan!
[01:09:13.424 --> 01:09:15.586]  How do I know what they're going to do next?
[01:09:15.586 --> 01:09:18.588]  They think you're so stupid, they've admitted their whole plan.
[01:09:19.943 --> 01:09:32.693]  I remember three years ago the headline in Council on Foreign Relations, Why We Need Al-Qaeda, and how they're great fighters doing a great job against Assad and how they can use them all over the Middle East.
[01:09:32.693 --> 01:09:40.880]  And just because they can sit back and go, you know, we use Al-Qaeda to make states be pliant for the greater good for America.
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.481]  Think about how evil that is.
[01:09:42.481 --> 01:09:46.665]  We'll make Assad or Iraq or anybody behave by bringing Al-Qaeda in.
[01:09:49.411 --> 01:10:01.316]  Now there's the headline, CFR Strategist Praises Al Qaeda Bombings in Syria, and that's an InfoWars.com article with a direct link to the Council on Foreign Relations white paper.
[01:10:01.316 --> 01:10:04.317]  And again, it was 2012, so that was two and a half years ago.
[01:10:04.317 --> 01:10:18.523]  The point is, then we have Hillary Clinton welcoming it in a clip, and that's because they know the general public doesn't know the difference between Al Qaeda and Shiite.
[01:10:19.947 --> 01:10:22.209]  Sunni versus Shia.
[01:10:22.209 --> 01:10:24.830]  They don't know anything, so they're doomed.
[01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:26.271]  The people perish for lack of knowledge.
[01:10:26.271 --> 01:10:32.195]  Jesus Christ said that.
[01:10:32.195 --> 01:10:46.165]  And it's very frustrating to know the players, to know the plan, to see it going on, and then to now, because they can't hide it, watch CNN, I watched it last night and this morning, just going, yeah, you know, maybe Al-Qaeda's got a point, or ISIS, they don't call it Al-Qaeda.
[01:10:48.513 --> 01:10:49.834]  ISIS.
[01:10:49.834 --> 01:10:52.415]  When it's Al-Qaeda, the black flag, Saudi Arabia.
[01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:56.036]  I mean, it's Al-Qaeda's daddy.
[01:10:56.036 --> 01:10:57.557]  It's worse than Al-Qaeda.
[01:10:57.557 --> 01:11:05.001]  In fact, there's even articles going, well, this group is worse than Al-Qaeda, but they're good.
[01:11:05.001 --> 01:11:10.123]  And then when I fly, they want me to go on a naked body scanner and they want to grab my genitals.
[01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:14.481]  All to train me publicly to be a slave.
[01:11:14.481 --> 01:11:17.021]  It has nothing to do with any of this.
[01:11:17.021 --> 01:11:23.242]  And now, and I'm going to your phone calls, we told you this a hundred times if we told you once.
[01:11:23.242 --> 01:11:25.203]  For three years.
[01:11:25.203 --> 01:11:26.363]  Before Benghazi happened.
[01:11:26.363 --> 01:11:31.784]  I said they're going to give Stinger missiles to Al-Qaeda and to Wahhabis.
[01:11:31.784 --> 01:11:33.905]  Because that gives the West plausible liability.
[01:11:33.905 --> 01:11:40.206]  Saudi Arabia has their agents, give it to their agents, give it to their jihad armies with ten levels of separation.
[01:11:41.502 --> 01:11:46.164]  They then are allowed into the United States, just like 15 of the 19 reported hijackers.
[01:11:46.164 --> 01:11:52.006]  I've had the former head of the embassy visa section, Springman, on the show repeatedly.
[01:11:52.006 --> 01:12:01.350]  He's been in mainstream news saying, we said, you guys are Al Qaeda terrorists, and the CIA called them up and said, national security, their terror designation is a cover.
[01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:03.531]  They are CIA agents.
[01:12:03.531 --> 01:12:06.112]  Not operatives, agents.
[01:12:06.112 --> 01:12:07.592]  Mohammed Adda and others were trained at U.S.
[01:12:07.592 --> 01:12:08.473]  military bases.
[01:12:08.473 --> 01:12:09.313]  That's mainstream news.
[01:12:10.572 --> 01:12:16.334]  Remember it came out when the head of the Defense Language School went, four of the hijackers were trained in my class for a year!
[01:12:16.334 --> 01:12:18.434]  Those guys on the news, I know them!
[01:12:18.434 --> 01:12:23.596]  I've had lunch with them!
[01:12:23.596 --> 01:12:27.237]  Alex Jones is a traitor that says the police blew up the World Trade Centers.
[01:12:27.237 --> 01:12:28.577]  I never said that.
[01:12:28.577 --> 01:12:30.298]  Yeah, the firefighters did it!
[01:12:30.298 --> 01:12:32.258]  And New Yorkers did it, he says!
[01:12:32.258 --> 01:12:37.280]  He says it's an inside job and Bush had a plunger like Wiley Coyote, that's a quote Chris Matthews,
[01:12:38.601 --> 01:12:50.495]  No, I said Saudi Arabia has got cheap dip commandos, they call them Al Qaeda, who will kill themselves attacking this country in order to do so, and then our government gets to take all of our rights away.
[01:12:50.495 --> 01:12:52.277]  It's 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:12:52.277 --> 01:12:53.999]  It is a simple equation.
[01:12:53.999 --> 01:12:58.044]  Where are the apologies from Sean Hannity?
[01:12:58.044 --> 01:12:58.685]  From Glenn Beck?
[01:13:00.643 --> 01:13:01.684]  From all of them.
[01:13:01.684 --> 01:13:03.005]  Zero apologies.
[01:13:03.005 --> 01:13:09.629]  The only person, I guess who's a professor and got like four degrees and a best-selling author, so I guess he is Dr. Savage.
[01:13:09.629 --> 01:13:14.412]  Savage has always pointed out that the West is funding Al-Qaeda and letting them attack.
[01:13:14.412 --> 01:13:18.995]  And he talks about false flag, because anyone who's informed says that.
[01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:22.537]  Two people talk about false flags, Alex Jones, Michael Savage.
[01:13:22.537 --> 01:13:25.279]  Believe me, all the others know all about it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:25.279 --> 01:13:26.660]  They just won't tell you about it.
[01:13:28.052 --> 01:13:33.135]  They go, Alex says there's no Muslim extremists and he wants to be with the jihadis.
[01:13:33.135 --> 01:13:34.716]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:13:34.716 --> 01:13:35.776]  It's the opposite.
[01:13:35.776 --> 01:13:36.997]  I'm saying don't arm them.
[01:13:36.997 --> 01:13:38.478]  I'm saying they are a threat.
[01:13:38.478 --> 01:13:42.300]  I'm saying it's a threat to take my liberties.
[01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:53.727]  And you have trillions of dollars every few years and no-bid contracts to consolidate control in this country, militarize the police, and I told you over a decade ago they would then flip when they prepare the revolution against the American people.
[01:13:54.761 --> 01:14:01.928]  Homeland Security from Al-Qaeda onto the Liberty Movement, the Patriots, which they call the Tea Party now.
[01:14:01.928 --> 01:14:08.274]  And it all happened because it's simple, geopolitical, three-dimensional chess strategy.
[01:14:09.258 --> 01:14:19.024]  I know the Gambits, I know the Stratagems, I know the entire enemy program in a 3D map in my mind that God gave me, just like you would have it if you studied all the players.
[01:14:19.024 --> 01:14:21.885]  Listen, adult men have fantasy football.
[01:14:21.885 --> 01:14:25.107]  They know where some football player went to high school.
[01:14:25.107 --> 01:14:26.668]  They know the guy's wife's name.
[01:14:26.668 --> 01:14:28.409]  They know all the baseball scores.
[01:14:28.409 --> 01:14:31.330]  They can go and tell you what play a coach is about to play.
[01:14:31.330 --> 01:14:32.911]  I've seen it with friends of mine.
[01:14:32.911 --> 01:14:35.373]  Before that team goes, oh my gosh, watch this.
[01:14:36.383 --> 01:14:41.365]  The Cowboys are gonna do this, or the 49ers are gonna do this, or the Cardinals are gonna do this, and you watch and they do it!
[01:14:41.365 --> 01:14:51.189]  And I go, my God, if you just use that brain in business or life, if you just use that for real stuff, see?
[01:14:51.189 --> 01:15:04.654]  They've got all these adults with fake, synthetic, artificial reality, artificial consciousness lives where they pay money to get a Lamborghini in a fictional world, hundreds of dollars, where you pay to get a supermodel girlfriend,
[01:15:06.505 --> 01:15:12.610]  Show you're at home and never really compete in the world.
[01:15:12.610 --> 01:15:16.993]  They got all these complex board games that are fine if you play them once a month.
[01:15:16.993 --> 01:15:18.474]  I play some of them with my kids.
[01:15:18.474 --> 01:15:20.736]  Action adventure games, you know, space games.
[01:15:20.736 --> 01:15:25.940]  It's like Dungeons and Dragons, but it's like sci-fi or whatever, you know, so it's not occultic.
[01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:35.187]  Star Trek games, Star Wars games, but to really get into it, you gotta learn all the players and it's complex and your brain's designed that if you get into something with strategy, you start liking it, but I go, wait a minute.
[01:15:37.970 --> 01:15:42.274]  I don't want to waste eight hours playing this game.
[01:15:42.274 --> 01:15:47.057]  See, because that takes up all my synapses, all my connections to war game reality.
[01:15:47.057 --> 01:15:49.319]  And what I'm saying is so incredibly simple.
[01:15:49.319 --> 01:15:50.080]  That's the thing.
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:51.461]  It's not my opinion.
[01:15:51.461 --> 01:15:53.402]  You don't have to believe me.
[01:15:53.402 --> 01:15:57.706]  You can go out and verify that they put hydrofluorosilicic acid, a.k.a.
[01:15:57.706 --> 01:16:02.550]  electrified, ionized, supercharged,
[01:16:04.824 --> 01:16:06.225]  Chemical warfare in your water.
[01:16:06.225 --> 01:16:09.587]  They brag they're doing it to brain damage you and your family.
[01:16:09.587 --> 01:16:12.009]  They brag they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[01:16:12.009 --> 01:16:13.190]  They're time-released.
[01:16:13.190 --> 01:16:14.731]  They brag.
[01:16:14.731 --> 01:16:17.813]  On every front, I'm telling you, it's public.
[01:16:17.813 --> 01:16:19.254]  It's public.
[01:16:19.254 --> 01:16:21.475]  It's public.
[01:16:21.475 --> 01:16:27.560]  The average lawyer, the average police officer, even the average social worker, the average person in the bureaucracy is not bad.
[01:16:28.803 --> 01:16:40.494]  But they're compartmentalized in their little niche, following the niche program they get from the publications and things they follow, and they don't have full spectrum analysis of the larger system outside the dome.
[01:16:40.494 --> 01:16:50.945]  It's like THX 1138 with Robert Duvall, directed by the great, and he was great in his earlier films, George Lucas.
[01:16:52.353 --> 01:17:07.541]  And in THX 1138, a remake of his college film, his college graduation film, Robert Duvall breaks through to the surface of the underground technocracy base and it's, you know, the sun in the sky and he's in the mountains.
[01:17:13.632 --> 01:17:24.099]  And of course, he's given interviews saying this was the plan they were told about in the 60s, when Aldous Huxley came and spoke at the college he was at.
[01:17:24.099 --> 01:17:32.645]  That Jim Morrison was also attending simultaneously, along with a bunch of other famous people.
[01:17:32.645 --> 01:17:35.387]  And they were given the inside track.
[01:17:35.387 --> 01:17:40.310]  And they've all talked about it.
[01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:43.212]  So, that's what's going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:44.449 --> 01:17:45.970]  And you better find out about it.
[01:17:45.970 --> 01:17:48.592]  I have come out of the cave, in Plato's allegory.
[01:17:48.592 --> 01:17:51.274]  I have come out to the surface, okay?
[01:17:51.274 --> 01:17:53.396]  And I want you to join me on the surface.
[01:17:53.396 --> 01:17:54.637]  It doesn't mean I have all the answers.
[01:17:54.637 --> 01:17:56.478]  It doesn't mean the surface is perfect.
[01:17:56.478 --> 01:17:59.961]  It doesn't mean there aren't other boxes to come out of, other levels.
[01:17:59.961 --> 01:18:03.483]  But let me tell you, I'm not in the level the general public is in.
[01:18:03.483 --> 01:18:05.765]  I have transcended this stuff.
[01:18:05.765 --> 01:18:09.568]  You know, FBI shows up and is trying to intimidate me or get in my face, ask me questions.
[01:18:09.568 --> 01:18:10.909]  I don't even laugh at them anymore.
[01:18:12.554 --> 01:18:13.795]  I feel sorry for them.
[01:18:13.795 --> 01:18:28.743]  I look at a program, Biological Android, in their own little cult, their own little group, just like Organized Crime, they go on vacations together, they believe the propaganda their whole life, they're just sitting here on an errand to follow orders, and I just think about how many... I think this guy will be dead within 10 years.
[01:18:28.743 --> 01:18:29.184]  You can tell.
[01:18:29.184 --> 01:18:30.104]  They give him a lot of vaccines.
[01:18:30.104 --> 01:18:33.186]  He's probably got all the RNA plugged into his DNA.
[01:18:33.186 --> 01:18:35.467]  Yeah, I bet he's got a mentally retarded kid at home.
[01:18:35.467 --> 01:18:38.409]  God, I bet he follows the whole system, and I bet, yeah.
[01:18:39.284 --> 01:18:42.889]  I bet he's got, I bet he's been divorced, I bet he can't even pay his bills, you know.
[01:18:42.889 --> 01:18:45.151]  That's why most of them turn to corruption.
[01:18:45.151 --> 01:18:45.972]  Yeah, he's walking dead.
[01:18:45.972 --> 01:18:48.255]  I feel sorry for him.
[01:18:48.255 --> 01:18:50.218]  And it's not that I'm on a power trip, folks.
[01:18:50.218 --> 01:18:55.304]  I am literally outside the bubble watching it all go on, but I'm within the bubble.
[01:18:55.304 --> 01:18:56.506]  So it's really become a joke.
[01:18:58.902 --> 01:19:01.424]  To know about human programming that the elite know about.
[01:19:01.424 --> 01:19:05.567]  You can walk in front of the most beautiful woman out there most of the time and say something insulting to them.
[01:19:05.567 --> 01:19:06.908]  Just like the pick-up lines.
[01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:12.212]  Just like all the guys study the pick-up books, but you gotta have the right, you know, the right confidence attitude.
[01:19:12.212 --> 01:19:14.754]  And it's just ridiculous, like punching buttons.
[01:19:14.754 --> 01:19:16.195]  Now, not all women are like that.
[01:19:16.195 --> 01:19:22.600]  The women I'm looking for in life, just like my wife, are the type of folks that aren't programmable.
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:25.322]  That aren't stupid.
[01:19:25.322 --> 01:19:27.584]  Because that's the sort of person you want to have kids with, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:28.559 --> 01:19:32.601]  And I don't want to be a biological android that's just programmable.
[01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:35.163]  Now, I got all the immigration news coming up, it's off the chart.
[01:19:35.163 --> 01:19:36.764]  New Michelle Obama news.
[01:19:36.764 --> 01:19:41.867]  A ton of news, but I'm going right to your calls when we come back from break.
[01:19:41.867 --> 01:19:48.151]  Local police are using surveillance tactics the Obama administration doesn't want you to know about.
[01:19:48.151 --> 01:19:49.551]  Is that an Alex Jones headline?
[01:19:49.551 --> 01:19:51.072]  No, that's AP.
[01:19:51.072 --> 01:19:53.914]  See, now it's okay to tell you about all this.
[01:19:53.914 --> 01:19:55.355]  It's a total criminal takeover.

[01:21:58.345 --> 01:22:01.166]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:22:01.166 --> 01:22:06.287]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:22:06.287 --> 01:22:14.408]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:14.408 --> 01:22:18.929]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:22:18.929 --> 01:22:22.730]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:22.890 --> 01:22:28.851]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:22:28.851 --> 01:22:32.012]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:22:32.012 --> 01:22:37.373]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:22:37.373 --> 01:22:44.275]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness
[01:22:44.275 --> 01:22:45.716]  You've talked about it for a while.
[01:22:45.716 --> 01:22:48.719]  Now it's time to get your family the emergency readiness pack it deserves.
[01:22:48.719 --> 01:22:50.501]  And there's one site to turn to.

[01:23:43.808 --> 01:23:44.629]  That's VaticanCatholic.com.
[01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:44.689]  800-513-0029.
[01:23:44.689 --> 01:23:45.069]  VaticanCatholic.com.
[01:24:06.209 --> 01:24:11.397]  Coming up, Michelle Obama says, I couldn't feed my kids right with a Harvard degree.
[01:24:11.397 --> 01:24:16.746]  You need the state to tell your kids what to eat.
[01:24:16.746 --> 01:24:18.789]  Cop punches a woman in the stomach for no reason.
[01:24:18.789 --> 01:24:19.610]  Crowd outraged.
[01:24:20.751 --> 01:24:21.471]  More on U.S.
[01:24:21.471 --> 01:24:26.254]  made Stinger missiles have likely fallen into ISI S hands.
[01:24:26.254 --> 01:24:29.496]  They admit that the NSA is working with local police.
[01:24:29.496 --> 01:24:35.380]  Folks, they only use the DEA to target shipments not controlled by the globalists and that even came out in the New York Times last year.
[01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:39.303]  Again, I told you that over a decade ago.
[01:24:39.303 --> 01:24:47.868]  That's why there's a whole system of government that's accustomed now to getting people in on the corruption to not tell the public about all the illegal stuff that's going on.
[01:24:50.834 --> 01:24:56.956]  Most of the cops don't know about this because it's all being used to run the criminal enterprise right outside the bubble.
[01:24:56.956 --> 01:25:02.858]  See, it's not just me outside the bubble and those of us that are informed on the side of liberty that are outside the bubble and know what's going on.
[01:25:02.858 --> 01:25:09.520]  The establishments outside running scams on people in the bubble and we're sitting here going, hey, we're watching them run the scam.
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:11.661]  You might want to come outside the bubble too.
[01:25:11.661 --> 01:25:12.501]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:25:13.609 --> 01:25:14.930]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:25:14.930 --> 01:25:16.771]  Marcos, Rich, Jerry, Todd, Allen.
[01:25:16.771 --> 01:25:19.113]  I'm going to take a lot of calls this hour.
[01:25:19.113 --> 01:25:24.296]  Then the reporters just talked to an ICE agent and more whistleblowers on the border.
[01:25:24.296 --> 01:25:29.199]  Big breaking news from the Texas border as the border implodes by design.
[01:25:29.199 --> 01:25:31.561]  But right now, let's go to Marcos in California.
[01:25:31.561 --> 01:25:32.322]  You're on the air.
[01:25:32.322 --> 01:25:33.883]  Thanks for calling.
[01:25:33.883 --> 01:25:34.843]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:25:34.843 --> 01:25:35.464]  I'm alright, brother.
[01:25:36.573 --> 01:25:37.074]  Pretty good.
[01:25:37.074 --> 01:25:49.665]  Well, I just wanted to know your thoughts on the idea that the Catholic Church created Islam by former Jesuit priest Alberto Rivera and his claims that that's happened and the globalists are still using that for their objectives.
[01:25:49.665 --> 01:25:56.591]  If you look at the Catholic Church's symbol, IHS, ISIS or SESH, I mean, we're still seeing ISIS pop up.
[01:25:56.591 --> 01:25:57.652]  I'd just like to know your thoughts on that.
[01:25:58.379 --> 01:26:05.341]  Well, you know, I'm not a Catholic, but I've studied a lot of the history of it, and I've said the Catholic Church was behind promoting the European Union.
[01:26:05.341 --> 01:26:13.763]  So the Catholic Church politically is involved in a bunch of stuff I don't agree with, and you're promoting socialism now, and it's a big deal.
[01:26:13.763 --> 01:26:17.164]  The Catholic Church isn't supposed to have a Jesuit ever run it.
[01:26:17.164 --> 01:26:20.344]  That's now happening, so a lot of stuff's going on.
[01:26:20.344 --> 01:26:23.225]  That said, I don't sit there and see the Catholics as one monolithic group.
[01:26:23.225 --> 01:26:26.286]  There's a lot of diverse ideas, a lot of conservative Catholics out there.
[01:26:27.226 --> 01:26:46.143]  I'm familiar with that particular Catholic priest you're talking about because schizophrenic people that are always claiming that I am a Catholic Vatican operative with zero proof because it makes them feel big to bear false witness against people are always claiming all this stuff about this guy.
[01:26:46.143 --> 01:26:52.890]  And I think it's asinine knowing history to say that the Catholic Church founded Islam
[01:26:54.442 --> 01:27:08.431]  When Islam almost drove out the Catholic Church and went as far north as areas of Germany and Poland and invaded Italy, invaded Spain, and the Catholic Church drove them out in the Crusades and barely survived.
[01:27:08.431 --> 01:27:10.892]  She could say what she want about the Catholic Church.
[01:27:10.892 --> 01:27:19.698]  The Catholic Church in the West, the Orthodox some in the East, but mainly the Catholic Church, Count Dracula the whole nine yards, literally stopped
[01:27:20.956 --> 01:27:25.644]  uh... the muslim invaders at places like kosovo and you name it show uh...
[01:27:27.898 --> 01:27:29.800]  The guy you're talking about was a Seventh-day Adventist.
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:31.401]  I don't think it's Seventh-day Adventist.
[01:27:31.401 --> 01:27:35.025]  My mom even worked with Seventh-day Adventists when I was a little kid as one of their secretaries.
[01:27:35.025 --> 01:27:37.807]  One of the big guys at a TV show in Dallas.
[01:27:37.807 --> 01:27:46.636]  But I mean, Seventh-day Adventists, sub-break-off groups, make stuff up and lie about anyone that doesn't agree with them and say that they're Vatican assassins.
[01:27:46.636 --> 01:27:53.042]  And so there's your answer to that whole subject of claiming that the Catholic Church is behind Islam.
[01:27:55.236 --> 01:28:13.551]  Mohammed is behind Islam and the fact that his religion that he founded, that then took in areas of Christianity and Judaism into it, was at a key crossroads of the silk trade and of the caravans and made people pay a tribute.
[01:28:13.551 --> 01:28:17.774]  They didn't pay a tribute for a thousand years before that at least, at Mecca.
[01:28:17.774 --> 01:28:21.037]  But when he took the key city of Mecca, it was like taking New York City.
[01:28:22.185 --> 01:28:29.227]  So that's why Islam is dominant, is because they took over the key city of Mecca geopolitically.
[01:28:29.227 --> 01:28:34.488]  Now it's not as fun as saying, you know, that the Vatican runs everything.
[01:28:34.488 --> 01:28:37.689]  It's not as easy intellectually to actually know history.
[01:28:37.689 --> 01:28:39.729]  But there's your answer.
[01:28:39.729 --> 01:28:41.150]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:41.150 --> 01:28:41.770]  Did I answer your question?
[01:28:42.930 --> 01:28:43.391]  Yes, you did.
[01:28:43.391 --> 01:28:43.931]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:28:43.931 --> 01:28:44.372]  Thank you.
[01:28:44.372 --> 01:28:45.953]  I appreciate it.
[01:28:45.953 --> 01:28:58.046]  Yeah, I mean, if the anti-Catholics want to get people on their bandwagon, they should try not running around, you know, like denouncing everyone as witches, basically, you know, and just saying horrible litigious things.
[01:28:58.046 --> 01:29:00.208]  Let's talk to Alan in Florida.
[01:29:00.208 --> 01:29:00.849]  You're on the air.
[01:29:00.849 --> 01:29:01.190]  Go ahead.
[01:29:02.352 --> 01:29:07.173]  I wanted to highlight two articles that went up on WorldNetDaily.
[01:29:07.173 --> 01:29:14.055]  The first one is called, of course, Besieged Iraq Sees Obama as Jihad Accomplice.
[01:29:14.055 --> 01:29:26.799]  And they're saying their source, who's close to the Maliki government, is claiming that Obama's in the middle of the scheme and that the Saudis have paid $3 billion to ISIS to overthrow Maliki.
[01:29:27.483 --> 01:29:28.063]  Absolutely.
[01:29:28.063 --> 01:29:30.724]  Guys, give me that WorldNet Daily article and the author that wrote it.
[01:29:30.724 --> 01:29:32.104]  We're getting Corsi on tomorrow.
[01:29:32.104 --> 01:29:34.505]  No, no, that's what I told everybody Friday.
[01:29:34.505 --> 01:29:36.746]  Obama uses Odinga down in Kenya.
[01:29:36.746 --> 01:29:39.787]  He got caught trying to overthrow with money.
[01:29:39.787 --> 01:29:46.208]  Fence through Kenya up into Northeastern Africa with Egypt.
[01:29:46.208 --> 01:29:48.729]  Absolutely to take over Obama's body.
[01:29:48.729 --> 01:29:50.109]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.109 --> 01:29:52.650]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.650 --> 01:29:55.331]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.736 --> 01:30:05.905]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:30:05.905 --> 01:30:10.472]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:30:10.472 --> 01:30:15.059]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:30:15.439 --> 01:30:18.360]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:23.821]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:30:23.821 --> 01:30:31.182]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare-earth, deep-earth crystals.
[01:30:31.182 --> 01:30:35.323]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:30:35.323 --> 01:30:40.104]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:40.444 --> 01:30:49.055]  This is innovating, and the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:30:49.055 --> 01:30:53.341]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[01:30:59.088 --> 01:31:06.252]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:31:06.252 --> 01:31:08.613]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:31:08.613 --> 01:31:13.896]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:31:13.896 --> 01:31:18.839]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:31:19.059 --> 01:31:22.382]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:31:22.382 --> 01:31:26.445]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:31:26.445 --> 01:31:30.789]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:31:30.789 --> 01:31:41.018]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:31:41.018 --> 01:31:43.540]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:51.931]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[01:31:59.824 --> 01:32:02.126]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[01:32:02.126 --> 01:32:09.550]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[01:32:09.550 --> 01:32:20.378]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[01:32:20.378 --> 01:32:29.604]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[01:32:30.344 --> 01:32:34.407]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:32:34.407 --> 01:32:38.169]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:32:38.169 --> 01:32:40.230]  Experience the new formula.
[01:32:40.230 --> 01:32:42.792]  Experience the ancient purity.
[01:32:42.792 --> 01:32:44.132]  Shield your family.
[01:32:44.132 --> 01:32:45.954]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:32:45.954 --> 01:32:49.115]  Available now at Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:49.115 --> 01:32:53.078]  X2 from Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:33:00.871 --> 01:33:04.612]  No weapons of mass destruction were found.
[01:33:04.612 --> 01:33:05.372]  Are you kidding me?
[01:33:05.372 --> 01:33:06.353]  Do you buy that?
[01:33:06.353 --> 01:33:08.273]  There were, there were, there were!
[01:33:08.273 --> 01:33:13.235]  Nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh!
[01:33:13.235 --> 01:33:15.335]  I was five and he was six.
[01:33:15.335 --> 01:33:19.356]  We rode on horses made of sticks.
[01:33:19.356 --> 01:33:22.057]  He wore black and I wore white.
[01:33:22.057 --> 01:33:23.597]  Come on, let's shoot!
[01:33:23.597 --> 01:33:24.318]  Flare!
[01:33:24.318 --> 01:33:27.599]  Bang, bang!
[01:33:27.599 --> 01:33:28.179]  Bang, bang!
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:41.905]  The main reason we went into Iraq at the time was we thought he had weapons of mass destruction.
[01:33:41.905 --> 01:33:45.169]  It turns out he didn't, but he had the capacity to make weapons of mass destruction.
[01:33:45.169 --> 01:33:47.291]  But I also talked about the human suffering in Iraq.
[01:33:48.533 --> 01:33:50.054]  Hello, boys and girls.
[01:33:50.054 --> 01:33:54.037]  I have a special message for you from the President of the United States.
[01:33:54.037 --> 01:34:04.906]  I salute the boys and girls who are buying United States savings stamps and bonds and are giving important support to the cause of freedom and the men who fight for us in Vietnam.
[01:34:04.906 --> 01:34:14.333]  Congress gave us this authority in August 1964 to do whatever may be necessary.
[01:34:14.333 --> 01:34:15.494]  That's pretty far-reaching.
[01:34:16.941 --> 01:34:18.962]  The sky's the limit.
[01:34:18.962 --> 01:34:22.304]  As an American citizen, you have to respect our president whether I like it or not.
[01:34:22.304 --> 01:34:27.726]  It's really not my decision, but I do respect my president and I will support whatever decision he makes.
[01:34:27.726 --> 01:34:30.327]  It is a hard fact.
[01:34:43.101 --> 01:34:43.762]  Now he's gone.
[01:34:43.762 --> 01:34:44.663]  I don't know why.
[01:34:44.663 --> 01:34:46.666]  Until this day, sometimes I cry.
[01:35:03.690 --> 01:35:08.633]  The United States knows that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.
[01:35:08.633 --> 01:35:13.035]  One of the first things they told me was, you're not even to acknowledge the drone program.
[01:35:13.035 --> 01:35:15.917]  You're not even to discuss that it exists.
[01:35:15.917 --> 01:35:25.803]  Renewed hostile actions against United States ships on the high seas in the Gulf of Tonkin have today required me
[01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:33.223]  To order the military forces of the United States to take action and reply.
[01:35:33.223 --> 01:35:35.625]  That reply is being given.
[01:35:35.625 --> 01:35:39.207]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:35:39.207 --> 01:35:44.490]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:44.490 --> 01:35:46.631]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:35:49.002 --> 01:35:51.123]  We're at the halfway point in the global transmission.
[01:35:51.123 --> 01:35:55.026]  We're going to the border with breaking news coming up at the start of the next hour, about 15 in.
[01:35:55.026 --> 01:36:01.010]  I want to go right back to your calls right now, but since the caller mentioned it, Alan, we do have it here on the stack.
[01:36:01.010 --> 01:36:03.892]  Document cam, please, for TV viewers.
[01:36:03.892 --> 01:36:04.613]  Blowback!
[01:36:04.613 --> 01:36:08.736]  U.S.-trained ISIS at secret Jordan base.
[01:36:08.736 --> 01:36:10.277]  Well, this is the kind of blowback you want.
[01:36:11.542 --> 01:36:14.463]  I told you about this secret base in the last three years.
[01:36:14.463 --> 01:36:16.903]  They also have them in Western Iraq.
[01:36:16.903 --> 01:36:21.684]  And I told you three months ago, when they started taking Fallujah, they would end up taking at least half the country.
[01:36:21.684 --> 01:36:25.445]  And we're being armed by the criminals that run our government.
[01:36:25.445 --> 01:36:31.266]  So World Wide Daily is doing a good job with their incredible Israeli and Jordanian sources.
[01:36:31.266 --> 01:36:37.967]  I mean, they did break that Odinga, Obama's cousin, was fencing the money by the millions in to the Muslim Brotherhood to overthrow Egypt.
[01:36:37.967 --> 01:36:38.847]  That came out in court.
[01:36:40.839 --> 01:36:43.960]  But it's not blowback.
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:53.903]  Our military trained these Al-Qaeda forces, gave them the weapons, along with Saudi Arabian military in Qatari, training them in French commandos and British commandos.
[01:36:53.903 --> 01:36:56.883]  All of those bases are over in Turkey.
[01:36:56.883 --> 01:36:59.024]  There's even more over in Turkey.
[01:36:59.024 --> 01:37:01.225]  That's where they would launch the fake chemical attacks on Assad.
[01:37:01.225 --> 01:37:02.705]  I'm not romanticizing Assad.
[01:37:02.705 --> 01:37:03.785]  He didn't do anything.
[01:37:03.785 --> 01:37:04.946]  He didn't attack anybody.
[01:37:04.946 --> 01:37:05.966]  He was democratizing.
[01:37:08.567 --> 01:37:16.033]  And then our government doesn't want them having a nice place where you want to go visit and go to their great beaches and go scuba diving or go see the ancient Roman and Greek ruins.
[01:37:16.033 --> 01:37:20.876]  There are better Roman ruins, folks, in Syria than there are in Rome.
[01:37:20.876 --> 01:37:23.138]  I wanted to go there five, ten years ago.
[01:37:23.138 --> 01:37:26.420]  If I could have chosen a place to go, it would have been Syria.
[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:27.701]  I've read the travel journals.
[01:37:27.701 --> 01:37:29.443]  It's incredible.
[01:37:29.443 --> 01:37:35.807]  We're talking 3,000-year-old open-air markets that are like you can't believe, and they're clean and safe.
[01:37:35.807 --> 01:37:36.808]  Not anymore they aren't.
[01:37:36.808 --> 01:37:37.869]  They've all been blown up.
[01:37:40.948 --> 01:37:43.290]  All been blown up.
[01:37:43.290 --> 01:37:47.072]  The damn Al-Qaeda people have been blowing up the ruins as well.
[01:37:47.072 --> 01:37:48.553]  There's nothing worse than Al-Qaeda.
[01:37:48.553 --> 01:37:49.613]  I am so sick of them.
[01:37:49.613 --> 01:37:51.274]  I hate their guts.
[01:37:51.274 --> 01:37:55.357]  Blowing up ancient Buddhist temples and you name it.
[01:37:55.357 --> 01:37:57.598]  In fact, the guys are putting on screen stuff they've blown up.
[01:37:57.598 --> 01:37:58.659]  Please take it down.
[01:37:58.659 --> 01:38:02.020]  I mean, they don't just kill Christians and innocent people.
[01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:03.501]  They blow up ruins.
[01:38:03.501 --> 01:38:04.482]  If it's evil, they do it.
[01:38:08.959 --> 01:38:10.581]  See, I get really angry, folks.
[01:38:10.581 --> 01:38:12.422]  I really do.
[01:38:12.422 --> 01:38:23.933]  That I'm a suspect, I'm a terrorist, according to Homeland Security, because I'm pro-freedom, and then the government runs Al-Qaeda, and the TSA's too stupid, the FBI's too dumb, the public doesn't know what end is up.
[01:38:23.933 --> 01:38:25.094]  Here it is, I'm going to your calls.
[01:38:25.094 --> 01:38:25.734]  Blowback!
[01:38:25.734 --> 01:38:32.180]  U.S.-trained IS secret Jordan base, members of the Islamic State of Iraq,
[01:38:33.263 --> 01:38:35.644]  And the Levant of the I.S.I.S.
[01:38:35.644 --> 01:38:37.564]  were trained in 2012 by U.S.
[01:38:37.564 --> 01:38:40.905]  instructors working at a secret base in Jordan.
[01:38:40.905 --> 01:38:43.165]  You know, I've had military on about that base.
[01:38:43.165 --> 01:38:48.206]  Because they would joke to them in English, we're going to kill you after we're done in Syria and Iraq.
[01:38:48.206 --> 01:38:52.527]  And so there were fights and stuff breaking out, and it was kind of a rebellion that hadn't been reported on yet.
[01:38:52.527 --> 01:38:55.308]  You heard it here years ago, but it will come out someday.
[01:38:55.308 --> 01:39:01.229]  That there was even reportedly a little more happened, and that the military refused to train them.
[01:39:01.229 --> 01:39:02.049]  After a while.
[01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:20.402]  Mainly because this show, and this is on record in the British News, this show pointed it out, Assad pointed it out, MI6 hacked Assad's emails, it was talking about me and Infowars and how they were going off my analysis in the Syrian government for their propaganda.
[01:39:20.402 --> 01:39:21.983]  Well it isn't propaganda, it's the truth!
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:30.101]  By the way, if you just joined us, look at the London Independent, London Guardian, Google Infowars.com Assad emails.
[01:39:30.101 --> 01:39:34.702]  Click web and you'll get the news articles in England where this was going on.
[01:39:34.702 --> 01:39:38.303]  So we exposed it with our military sources.
[01:39:38.303 --> 01:39:41.043]  Assad picked it up, put it out, then why are you aiding Al-Qaeda?
[01:39:41.043 --> 01:39:44.764]  Then the rest of the media picked it up.
[01:39:44.764 --> 01:39:45.764]  Ted Cruz picked it up.
[01:39:45.764 --> 01:39:47.004]  Rand Paul picked it up.
[01:39:47.004 --> 01:39:48.505]  And then it was over.
[01:39:48.505 --> 01:39:50.485]  No more public backing of these people.
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:56.522]  So that's the power of Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:39:56.522 --> 01:39:57.522]  But here it is.
[01:39:57.522 --> 01:40:03.045]  Members of the Islamic State of Iraq, the ISIS, were trained by U.S.
[01:40:03.045 --> 01:40:03.445]  military.
[01:40:04.571 --> 01:40:15.839]  The officials said dozens of IS members were trained, about thousands, at the time as part of a covert aid to insurgents targeting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.
[01:40:15.839 --> 01:40:21.562]  The officials said the training was not meant to be used for any future campaign in Iraq.
[01:40:21.562 --> 01:40:24.184]  That's why they did the base right on the border with Iraq.
[01:40:24.184 --> 01:40:33.290]  The Jordanian officials said the IS-IS members who received US training to fight in Syria were first vetted for any links to extremist groups like al-Qaeda.
[01:40:33.290 --> 01:40:34.251]  Oh, that's a good one.
[01:40:34.951 --> 01:40:36.012]  Here's another one.
[01:40:36.012 --> 01:40:38.034]  USAID spawning new breed of jihadist.
[01:40:38.034 --> 01:40:39.555]  Also out of World Net Daily.
[01:40:39.555 --> 01:40:41.017]  Out of Beirut, Lebanon.
[01:40:41.017 --> 01:40:42.258]  With F. Michael Maloof.
[01:40:42.258 --> 01:40:43.639]  We ought to get Maloof on.
[01:40:45.137 --> 01:40:47.838]  The point is, ladies and gentlemen, this is to cause a proxy war.
[01:40:47.838 --> 01:40:48.438]  Let's go to your calls.
[01:40:48.438 --> 01:40:49.819]  I'm going to shut up and go to your calls.
[01:40:49.819 --> 01:40:53.380]  The caller brought it up, so I thought I would just mention it.
[01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:55.941]  If you guys can't find that, which is no big deal, just call Watson.
[01:40:55.941 --> 01:40:57.161]  He wrote an article about it.
[01:40:57.161 --> 01:40:59.662]  He can pull it up for you.
[01:40:59.662 --> 01:41:01.163]  I'm not putting down your search skills.
[01:41:01.163 --> 01:41:02.123]  Watson's even better than me.
[01:41:02.123 --> 01:41:03.704]  He can find anything.
[01:41:03.704 --> 01:41:05.104]  Alan, that was the point you raised.
[01:41:05.104 --> 01:41:06.405]  I thought I would back up what you were saying.
[01:41:06.405 --> 01:41:06.745]  Go ahead.
[01:41:07.554 --> 01:41:08.695]  Yes, thank you, sir.
[01:41:08.695 --> 01:41:10.576]  I have one follow-up point.
[01:41:10.576 --> 01:41:22.662]  In my own research, I discovered that on October 31st, 2012, Hillary Clinton, then Secretary of State, arrived at Zagreb International Airport in Croatia.
[01:41:22.662 --> 01:41:23.583]  Now, coincidentally,
[01:41:24.483 --> 01:41:37.708]  Several weeks later, and this was uncovered by the New York Times and a paper in England, 75 cargo plane loads started moving through that airport, the exact same airport Hillary visited.
[01:41:37.708 --> 01:41:47.412]  Those weapons were coming from Croatia, and they were going through Turkey and through Jordan and right to the border, and then they were trucked over the border into Syria.
[01:41:47.412 --> 01:41:49.192]  The same MO.
[01:41:49.192 --> 01:41:50.333]  Oh no, that's all on record.
[01:41:50.333 --> 01:41:52.594]  They actually had Al-Qaeda bases in Iraq.
[01:41:53.453 --> 01:41:59.736]  And then Maliki would attack them and our media would call him a devil for suppressing his loving citizens.
[01:41:59.736 --> 01:42:11.240]  I mean, if you turn on CNN right now, they're saying every hour, because I've watched it two hours off and on this morning and last night, they're saying, well, the president of Iraq asked for it, he's a bad guy.
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:14.922]  And then no wonder they're going, we don't want to do anything to Al Qaeda.
[01:42:14.922 --> 01:42:18.544]  I mean, do you think they can get away with this?
[01:42:18.544 --> 01:42:19.324]  It's so obvious.
[01:42:20.762 --> 01:42:23.605]  The question is, are the troops going to wake up?
[01:42:23.605 --> 01:42:28.691]  Remember when they started saying, I don't want to be part of the Al Qaeda Air Force?
[01:42:28.691 --> 01:42:30.253]  Where's this going to go now?
[01:42:30.253 --> 01:42:35.258]  Now that he's sending spec ops into Iraq?
[01:42:35.258 --> 01:42:36.139]  What are the troops?
[01:42:36.139 --> 01:42:36.660]  They're in the middle.
[01:42:39.255 --> 01:42:40.496]  It's incredible, brother.
[01:42:40.496 --> 01:42:41.296]  It's totally incredible.
[01:42:41.296 --> 01:42:41.757]  God bless you.
[01:42:41.757 --> 01:42:42.417]  I appreciate your call.
[01:42:42.417 --> 01:42:43.758]  By the way, the guys had put it on screen.
[01:42:43.758 --> 01:42:44.638]  I hadn't seen it.
[01:42:44.638 --> 01:42:55.785]  Type in Asad's emails, InfoWars.com, and then click that, and it brings up mainstream news where Asad was going off InfoWars.com.
[01:42:55.785 --> 01:43:07.692]  I never really bragged about it at the time, because it's not something you brag about, but that's the type of stuff that comes out.
[01:43:09.807 --> 01:43:12.048]  Because we really know what's going on.
[01:43:12.048 --> 01:43:26.113]  And the Russian government, listeners to us, I had the number three guy at the time from the Japanese government on.
[01:43:26.113 --> 01:43:28.133]  Alright, let's go right back to your calls.
[01:43:28.133 --> 01:43:30.074]  Let's talk to Rich in Oregon.
[01:43:30.074 --> 01:43:32.755]  Rich, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:43:32.755 --> 01:43:34.936]  It's a pleasure to talk to you again, Alex Jones.
[01:43:36.963 --> 01:43:42.788]  Hey, I was, uh, gotta tell you, I started watching Jesse Venture in about 2010.
[01:43:42.788 --> 01:43:45.290]  I believe this show was Conspiracy Theory.
[01:43:45.290 --> 01:43:46.250]  Yes.
[01:43:46.250 --> 01:43:51.855]  And, um, I don't even know how I got hooked up with yours, but I was pretty skeptical of you in the beginning.
[01:43:51.855 --> 01:44:01.583]  And, um, over the last, I would say year and a half, I've actually gotten my eyes open more and more and I actually became a supporter of InfoWars.
[01:44:01.583 --> 01:44:03.004]  You know what I mean?
[01:44:03.004 --> 01:44:05.426]  So I seen this thing with Kate, uh,
[01:44:06.698 --> 01:44:12.219]  Megan Kelly, was that last night, I guess it was, about talking about what you said.
[01:44:12.219 --> 01:44:15.560]  I want to say it's been a couple years ago over Benghazi.
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:16.520]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:32.083]  How many times, because we were not able to find a clip, it's a needle in a haystack, how many hundreds of times, or how many times have you heard me or have you not heard me say they'll give the Stinger missiles to Al Qaeda, then they'll say they're going to shoot down our airliners, and they're going to attack America, we've got to take your rights?
[01:44:33.439 --> 01:44:40.484]  Oh yeah, I've heard you say it a lot of times, but you know, again, that goes back to being a little skeptic, so I started researching myself, you know what I mean?
[01:44:40.484 --> 01:44:46.069]  And you can find all kinds of things on the internet, and believe it or not, I mean, it's kind of your choice.
[01:44:46.069 --> 01:45:02.241]  But when you're backing up stuff with documents and proof, that's why I thought that, I don't know if you got a crystal ball or you just got real good intel, but you were on the money, and I gotta tell you, the only way I know how to fix anything like this
[01:45:03.027 --> 01:45:04.408]  We're good to go.
[01:45:31.673 --> 01:45:36.175]  And then they go, oh, gee, weapons they got, they're using them on Iraq.
[01:45:36.175 --> 01:45:38.316]  Oh, but the leader of Iraq deserves it.
[01:45:38.316 --> 01:45:41.598]  I mean, they're not even covering it up anymore.
[01:45:41.598 --> 01:45:42.938]  That's the disdain they have for us.
[01:45:42.938 --> 01:45:43.499]  God bless you.
[01:45:43.499 --> 01:45:47.340]  Great points.
[01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:50.042]  And then there's this argument, well, Iran's backing the other side.
[01:45:50.042 --> 01:45:52.223]  Iran's not attacking anybody right now.
[01:45:52.223 --> 01:45:54.064]  Iran's trying to do peace deals.
[01:45:54.064 --> 01:45:58.386]  Whoever offensively starts the wars is in the wrong.
[01:45:58.386 --> 01:46:00.087]  But it's just like we attacked Iraq after 9-11.
[01:46:01.809 --> 01:46:07.913]  If we get attacked with a new 9-11, will we attack England?
[01:46:07.913 --> 01:46:21.683]  The enemy of Saudi Arabia, Shiite Iraq, got attacked by the United States, when supposedly Saudi Arabia attacked us, with proof.
[01:46:22.867 --> 01:46:26.691]  See, 2 plus 2 doesn't equal a thousand, like they say.
[01:46:26.691 --> 01:46:31.717]  2 plus 2 says Saudi Arabia is deep involved in all this, and of course they are.
[01:46:31.717 --> 01:46:36.002]  And it's now admitted they're behind the ISIS army.
[01:46:36.002 --> 01:46:37.704]  That's an army!
[01:46:37.704 --> 01:46:42.690]  That's not just a group of terrorists throwing hand grenades that popped up out of a jack-in-the-box somewhere.
[01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:50.253]  And this is their plan to ruin Iraq.
[01:46:50.253 --> 01:46:53.336]  When the globalists get control of a country, folks, they wreck it.
[01:46:53.336 --> 01:47:00.221]  Look at what they're doing to America with the borders and the jobs.
[01:47:00.221 --> 01:47:01.543]  Very frustrating.
[01:47:01.543 --> 01:47:07.027]  And also, Saudi Arabia wants to export all its jihadis out of their country.
[01:47:07.027 --> 01:47:14.093]  Because Al-Qaeda is so horrible, folks, they're sometimes trying to bomb their own papa.
[01:47:14.093 --> 01:47:14.934]  King Saud.
[01:47:18.496 --> 01:47:21.657]  Let's go to the Megyn Kelly clip in case you just joined us again.
[01:47:21.657 --> 01:47:23.058]  And it's on all the channels.
[01:47:23.058 --> 01:47:27.660]  We have a bunch of these clips saying, get ready, here come the Stinger Missiles.
[01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:32.342]  And I couldn't believe it this morning and I tried to get video of it on my iPhone but it ended.
[01:47:32.342 --> 01:47:40.386]  I was watching CNN and they said, undoubtedly we've got to come up with measures to stop these Stinger Missiles from being used, you know, to shoot down our planes.
[01:47:40.386 --> 01:47:40.906]  And the lady's like,
[01:47:42.722 --> 01:47:43.542]  What do we do?
[01:47:43.542 --> 01:47:47.363]  And then the other commentator goes, yes, what do we do to the security analysts?
[01:47:47.363 --> 01:47:51.123]  They go, we may have to put security at perimeters around the airport.
[01:47:51.123 --> 01:47:56.504]  See, I just envisioned it'll be five miles away from the airport and they'll just have a checkpoint to look for Stinger missiles.
[01:47:56.504 --> 01:47:58.305]  Because they gave Al-Qaeda Stinger missiles.
[01:47:58.305 --> 01:48:00.065]  No one will debate that or discuss that.
[01:48:00.065 --> 01:48:02.205]  It's just now checkpoints everywhere.
[01:48:02.205 --> 01:48:09.107]  Constitution-free zones, not just near the border, but anywhere in America because, oh, there might be a Stinger missile.
[01:48:09.107 --> 01:48:10.627]  No Stinger missiles under here.
[01:48:10.627 --> 01:48:11.187]  None under there.
[01:48:12.461 --> 01:48:17.764]  If you want to conquer a country, how do the globalists want to conquer the country?
[01:48:17.764 --> 01:48:19.365]  Do they openly come out and attack Americans?
[01:48:19.365 --> 01:48:20.005]  No, no, no.
[01:48:20.005 --> 01:48:30.931]  They protect us by taking our rights, and surveilling us, and setting up checkpoints to fight Al-Qaeda, but then admitting Homeland Security is really training to fight who?
[01:48:30.931 --> 01:48:35.374]  The American people.
[01:48:35.374 --> 01:48:38.776]  76% of the American people live within 100 miles of the border of the coast.
[01:48:40.299 --> 01:48:44.222]  And within a hundred miles there is no constitution according to Homeland Security.
[01:48:44.222 --> 01:48:47.204]  They call it Constitution Free Zones.
[01:48:47.204 --> 01:48:50.246]  And now anyone near an airport within five... Watch.
[01:48:50.246 --> 01:48:52.467]  I mean, I know how they operate.
[01:48:52.467 --> 01:48:56.090]  And then when Al-Qaeda hits a train station and... See?
[01:48:56.090 --> 01:48:57.411]  Oh, somebody shot up a school?
[01:48:57.411 --> 01:48:59.032]  Now the schools are prisons.
[01:48:59.032 --> 01:49:00.232]  See?
[01:49:00.232 --> 01:49:05.276]  To protect it, of course.
[01:49:05.276 --> 01:49:08.158]  Let's go ahead and go to Megyn Kelly about the Stinger missiles.
[01:49:09.013 --> 01:49:28.458]  Not only are we getting new reports that this group may have executed as many as 1,700 Iraqi security forces in recent days, including in a massacre that they put online and bragged about, but today we learned that the same group may now be in possession of a deadly cache of American-made firepower, Stinger missiles.
[01:49:28.458 --> 01:49:33.559]  They are powerful enough to take down a commercial airliner.
[01:49:33.559 --> 01:49:37.120]  Meanwhile, our reporters are down at the border and about to file a bunch of reports.
[01:49:39.525 --> 01:49:59.105]  Where the Border Patrol messes with them when they're white guys, a Hispanic guy, and a black guy with cameras, with microphone flags, clearly press, but let the illegals pull in buses in front of them and load up on vans to be driven into the country.
[01:49:59.105 --> 01:50:02.148]  Meanwhile, in Virginia and other states, in cities that are collapsing,
[01:50:03.393 --> 01:50:07.935]  The towns are saying, we're not going to have the local city building house all these illegals.
[01:50:07.935 --> 01:50:16.460]  These are Democrat cities, by the way, in New York, Virginia, and other areas, in Pittsburgh, you name it, Pennsylvania, where everything's collapsing.
[01:50:16.460 --> 01:50:29.287]  And they're seeing their precious Democrats house the illegals to get the federal funds and all the rest of it, fighting back residents, force feds to scrap plan to house illegals in Virginia College.
[01:50:29.287 --> 01:50:30.888]  Folks, it's on.
[01:50:30.888 --> 01:50:31.248]  It's on.
[01:50:33.388 --> 01:50:45.995]  Again, shutting the power plants off, shutting the factories off, devaluing the dollar, shipping the jobs overseas, opening the borders completely wide open.
[01:50:45.995 --> 01:50:48.716]  It's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:48.716 --> 01:50:52.278]  And now, Mainstream News is asking, is DHS a standing army?
[01:50:52.278 --> 01:50:54.279]  Of course it is.
[01:50:54.279 --> 01:50:57.681]  Jerry and others, your calls are coming up on the other side of this break.
[01:50:57.681 --> 01:50:58.121]  Stay with us.

[01:51:29.551 --> 01:51:36.575]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic, and only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[01:51:36.575 --> 01:51:37.956]  Silverlungs.com.

[01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:47.882]  The Silverlungs generator allows you to make your own, so stop paying for silver solutions.
[01:51:47.882 --> 01:51:53.206]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[01:51:56.091 --> 01:52:01.497]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:52:01.497 --> 01:52:09.426]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:52:09.426 --> 01:52:16.534]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:52:16.974 --> 01:52:21.536]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[01:52:21.536 --> 01:52:32.081]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:52:32.081 --> 01:52:38.524]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[01:52:59.110 --> 01:53:03.251]  Hey folks, this is Larry Crisp for BabyBoomerBackupPlan.com.
[01:53:03.251 --> 01:53:06.952]  I don't have to tell you, this economy sucks.
[01:53:06.952 --> 01:53:14.054]  Unlike the political elite and Wall Street bankers, you know that debts don't disappear and bailouts have big consequences.
[01:53:14.474 --> 01:53:21.260]  Stock and real estate market bubbles can pop at any moment and evaporate most or all of your retirement savings.
[01:53:21.260 --> 01:53:25.784]  Folks, we're in the weakest economy of our lifetime and it's likely to get much worse.
[01:53:25.784 --> 01:53:31.649]  Virtually zero sectors of the economy are hiring and workforce participation is at record lows.
[01:53:32.109 --> 01:53:35.730]  And I'm here to tell you, this may be the best thing that could happen to you.
[01:53:35.730 --> 01:53:39.111]  If you move decidedly and develop a backup plan immediately.
[01:53:39.111 --> 01:53:44.933]  Proportionately more millionaires were created during the Great Depression than at any time in history.
[01:53:44.933 --> 01:53:46.994]  And history is about to repeat itself.
[01:53:46.994 --> 01:53:51.235]  Get my free report at babyboomerbackupplan.com or call 888-507-8789.
[01:53:51.235 --> 01:53:51.415]  That's 888-507-8789.
[01:54:05.933 --> 01:54:13.516]  This article just went live at Infowars.com.
[01:54:13.516 --> 01:54:21.040]  Border Patrol investigates reporters, but not flood of illegals.
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:31.344]  Yeah, next we're going to send our reporters to these bus stations right over the border where the illegals disgorge and they get right on buses from Catholic churches, Protestant churches, Evangelicals, they're all in on it.
[01:54:32.435 --> 01:54:36.097]  And then they just bus them in to be given their voter ID cards, I guess.
[01:54:36.097 --> 01:54:40.679]  That story and video is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:54:40.679 --> 01:54:49.222]  And this stuff is so outrageous that if we just all expose it, it will boomerang back on the establishment.
[01:54:49.222 --> 01:54:52.064]  There's a good chance that we can turn this around.
[01:54:52.064 --> 01:54:58.026]  This is desperation by the political class doing this.
[01:54:58.026 --> 01:55:01.108]  Jerry in Georgia, thanks for holding, you're on the air.
[01:55:01.108 --> 01:55:01.568]  Then Todd.
[01:55:03.220 --> 01:55:09.426]  Hi Alex, I just wanted to say that this whole situation should be portrayed as Obama's Pearl Harbor.
[01:55:09.426 --> 01:55:23.258]  This is either the biggest failure of the intelligence community in his administration or he chose to look the other way as an army of a thousand vehicles and thousands of men was amassed.
[01:55:24.964 --> 01:55:27.606]  You're talking about the ISIS.
[01:55:27.606 --> 01:55:43.441]  The illegal alien takeover is a giant army, politically, and what's happening in Iraq, and what's happening with George Soros bragging he backed the overthrow in Ukraine with literal right-wing Nazis taking over and killing people.
[01:55:43.441 --> 01:55:45.463]  Notice they're moving on all fronts.
[01:55:45.463 --> 01:55:48.166]  That's when you know all hell's gonna break loose, brother.
[01:55:48.166 --> 01:55:49.287]  This is only the beginning.
[01:55:49.827 --> 01:55:51.269]  I mean, do you see what's happening?
[01:55:51.269 --> 01:55:56.917]  A global destabilization program, right as the food prices are set to double.
[01:55:56.917 --> 01:55:58.098]  Hyperinflation, brother.
[01:55:58.098 --> 01:56:00.421]  Can you imagine the hell that's about to break loose?
[01:56:01.454 --> 01:56:07.476]  Oh, absolutely, but the way to get the sheeple to understand is to ask the simple question.
[01:56:07.476 --> 01:56:14.679]  I mean, did the entire intelligence community, the satellites, the Predators, the Global Hawks, all this miss an army?
[01:56:14.679 --> 01:56:23.002]  Or did Obama ignore his daily morning folder of intelligence and decide to overlook an army being massed outside Iraq?
[01:56:23.662 --> 01:56:24.503]  One of the two.
[01:56:24.503 --> 01:56:26.465]  It's a simple one or two.
[01:56:26.465 --> 01:56:27.445]  Which was it?
[01:56:27.445 --> 01:56:32.770]  Because last week, all I heard was three obsolete tanks from Russia went to Ukraine.
[01:56:32.770 --> 01:56:36.513]  So they can't miss three tanks, but they somehow miss 8,000 men and 1,000 vehicles.
[01:56:39.015 --> 01:56:47.176]  They don't miss a few hundred Russian troops infiltrating to be observers in eastern Ukraine, and they know all about that in their names.
[01:56:47.176 --> 01:56:55.598]  But they didn't know tens of thousands of men from multiple angles, now hundreds of thousands, loading up in armored vehicles with weapons pouring in.
[01:56:55.598 --> 01:56:56.398]  They knew nothing about it.
[01:56:56.398 --> 01:56:57.138]  Listen.
[01:56:57.138 --> 01:56:57.858]  Blowback.
[01:56:57.858 --> 01:57:01.099]  U.S.-trained ISIS at secret Jordan base.
[01:57:01.099 --> 01:57:02.819]  We told people this years ago, folks.
[01:57:02.819 --> 01:57:04.119]  This was planned.
[01:57:08.755 --> 01:57:10.096]  Put the pressure on.
[01:57:10.096 --> 01:57:16.240]  You're going to have somebody, hopefully from the intelligence community, coming out and saying, no, no, no, we did our job.
[01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:17.601]  We told the President.
[01:57:17.601 --> 01:57:18.802]  He was briefed.
[01:57:18.802 --> 01:57:20.783]  He ignored it.
[01:57:20.783 --> 01:57:23.405]  I totally agree with you, and there's no debating it.
[01:57:23.405 --> 01:57:26.066]  But then the emails will just disappear like with IRS gates.
[01:57:26.066 --> 01:57:28.028]  See, that's the thing.
[01:57:28.028 --> 01:57:33.351]  If the current power structure doesn't get in trouble for this, the sky's the limit.
[01:57:33.351 --> 01:57:34.632]  I mean, they can do anything.
[01:57:36.030 --> 01:57:44.515]  With black Al-Qaeda flags that say, you know, Al-Qaeda on them, they're invading, and our media is going, well, the Iraqi government deserves it.
[01:57:44.515 --> 01:57:46.516]  It's outrageous.
[01:57:46.516 --> 01:57:52.499]  We're going to go to break, come back and talk to Todd, and then Kevin, Mary, Chris, and others.
[01:57:52.499 --> 01:57:56.882]  Then we'll get to our reporters on the border with multiple breaking nuggets.
[01:57:56.882 --> 01:58:03.846]  So we'll both have Jakari Jackson and John Bowne reporting, with Adan Salazar riding in the wings down there with them, along with cameraman
[01:58:06.175 --> 01:58:07.816]  Joe Jennings.

[02:00:05.572 --> 02:00:06.873]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.873 --> 02:00:08.655]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.655 --> 02:00:10.396]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.396 --> 02:00:11.997]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.997 --> 02:00:13.539]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.539 --> 02:00:17.742]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.742 --> 02:00:23.027]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.027 --> 02:00:24.448]  I'm coming to you from Austin, Texas.
[02:00:24.448 --> 02:00:27.651]  If you're watching us on TV, we have a live feed of the Brownsville
[02:00:28.823 --> 02:00:35.985]  Border Patrol station where they're just completely overwhelmed by Obama inviting the invasion of illegals across.
[02:00:35.985 --> 02:00:39.907]  The buses just pull in, the illegals get off, and it just floods in.
[02:00:39.907 --> 02:00:52.211]  Obama has deployed the Border Patrol, this started three years ago, to pick up trash in the desert and to give citizens tickets for riding their four-wheelers in the wrong area or checking ice chests on rivers for beer.
[02:00:53.564 --> 02:00:54.304]  I'm not kidding.
[02:00:54.304 --> 02:00:55.965]  I've experienced it.
[02:00:55.965 --> 02:01:01.187]  While the illegals walk right past you and get in a van and drive off, the Border Patrol comes over and opens your ice chest.
[02:01:01.187 --> 02:01:02.228]  It was just looking for beer.
[02:01:02.228 --> 02:01:03.968]  I don't have any beer.
[02:01:03.968 --> 02:01:07.130]  Well, if you do have beer, don't be drinking it.
[02:01:07.130 --> 02:01:09.691]  I was sitting there.
[02:01:09.691 --> 02:01:13.032]  Two months ago at Big Bend.
[02:01:13.032 --> 02:01:16.353]  In a natural hot springs on the edge of the Rio Grande.
[02:01:16.353 --> 02:01:17.874]  No one around me.
[02:01:17.874 --> 02:01:19.555]  With a couple of my buddies.
[02:01:19.555 --> 02:01:20.235]  Went camping with.
[02:01:22.130 --> 02:01:26.673]  And we're just sitting there, and we hear, ahem!
[02:01:26.673 --> 02:01:29.555]  And we turn, the guy's got a hand on this guy, and he goes, what are you doing?
[02:01:29.555 --> 02:01:34.858]  He was looking at us all disgusted, and we went, sitting there in a hot spring.
[02:01:34.858 --> 02:01:39.421]  One of the major attractions there, and the guy goes, it's a little hot, be careful.
[02:01:41.832 --> 02:01:45.094]  And that was one of the actual armed park rangers that wasn't border patrol.
[02:01:45.094 --> 02:01:46.775]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[02:01:46.775 --> 02:01:49.236]  I can't even go to the National Seashore anymore.
[02:01:49.236 --> 02:01:51.437]  My mother wanted to go there for her birthday like three years ago.
[02:01:51.437 --> 02:01:53.518]  I shot some video of it.
[02:01:53.518 --> 02:02:00.282]  And like five times in one night, this guy kept coming by and talking to us, saying, watch out for rattlesnakes, don't drink, what are you doing?
[02:02:00.282 --> 02:02:02.623]  And I know he was going to harass everybody else too.
[02:02:02.623 --> 02:02:05.585]  And finally I went, dude, leave me alone, you control freak!
[02:02:05.585 --> 02:02:11.008]  He's like, are you OCD, like a mental patient who just has to keep coming up and messing with us?
[02:02:12.671 --> 02:02:17.494]  And then I noticed that they would pull over almost everybody leaving when you go to the grocery store to see if they were drinking.
[02:02:17.494 --> 02:02:18.915]  I just can't handle it, man.
[02:02:18.915 --> 02:02:20.036]  Take me back to America.
[02:02:20.036 --> 02:02:21.296]  Where is it?
[02:02:21.296 --> 02:02:23.518]  Not all you little nobodies running around.
[02:02:23.518 --> 02:02:25.559]  Let's talk to Todd in Texas.
[02:02:25.559 --> 02:02:26.399]  Todd, you're on the air.
[02:02:26.399 --> 02:02:27.000]  Thanks for calling.
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:28.000]  Go ahead.
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:28.321]  Yeah.
[02:02:28.321 --> 02:02:29.501]  Hi, Alex.
[02:02:29.501 --> 02:02:36.686]  I was kind of listening to you yesterday and you were talking about the illegal aliens and the church helping them out.
[02:02:36.686 --> 02:02:39.608]  And as soon as you said that, I was like, wow.
[02:02:40.490 --> 02:02:55.097]  And it flashed me back to Denver International Airport, and if you look at the murals, there's a bombed out church on one side, a bunch of dead Hispanic children laying in a ditch, and their mothers crying over them.
[02:02:55.097 --> 02:02:59.880]  I was just wondering, are they going to use, I know they love to use children for false flags.
[02:03:00.888 --> 02:03:03.309]  Could they be going down the same road?
[02:03:03.309 --> 02:03:05.049]  Oh, yeah.
[02:03:05.049 --> 02:03:10.891]  They've actually removed that mural, I've been told, or moved it to another area of the airport where it's not seen as much.
[02:03:10.891 --> 02:03:17.372]  It's definitely very Illuminati occultic, and a lot has been made of it.
[02:03:17.372 --> 02:03:18.533]  And we're showing one panel of it.
[02:03:18.533 --> 02:03:20.053]  It's got a bunch of panels.
[02:03:20.053 --> 02:03:24.834]  But it's definitely... I forget who the artist is, but it's basically a bunch of La Reconquista stuff.
[02:03:24.834 --> 02:03:26.455]  So that's exactly what it is.
[02:03:27.475 --> 02:03:32.324]  And you know, my whole issue is, I don't reject Spanish culture or any of it, that's a big part of the West.
[02:03:32.324 --> 02:03:36.672]  I don't like the artificial leftist, globalist stuff they force feed.
[02:03:40.307 --> 02:03:46.514]  And this weird thing about how the mixture of the European and the Native is going to create the God race and all this stuff.
[02:03:46.514 --> 02:03:57.728]  I mean, I've got video, I've heard it before, we've got to find it, of Mayor Gus Garcia in Austin actually saying that his kids were the superior race deposited here by space aliens.
[02:03:59.383 --> 02:04:00.104]  What's old is new.
[02:04:00.104 --> 02:04:02.265]  We ought to find that clip and not call Steve Mason up.
[02:04:02.265 --> 02:04:03.286]  I know he's got it.
[02:04:03.286 --> 02:04:05.368]  He's got the Frontline Texas Show.
[02:04:05.368 --> 02:04:08.250]  That was his farewell address was about space aliens.
[02:04:08.250 --> 02:04:11.152]  I mean, you just can't make this stuff up.
[02:04:11.152 --> 02:04:12.633]  Anything else, sir?
[02:04:12.633 --> 02:04:15.795]  Well, I just want to get it out there.
[02:04:15.795 --> 02:04:18.377]  I don't want a bunch of kids getting hurt.
[02:04:18.377 --> 02:04:21.159]  That'd be crazy.
[02:04:21.159 --> 02:04:25.041]  Well, a bunch of kids are getting killed right now by Al-Qaeda in Syria and Iraq.
[02:04:25.041 --> 02:04:27.043]  If you're a Christian man, woman, or child, you're dead.
[02:04:28.883 --> 02:04:34.927]  And there's no Christian group like the ADL for Jews or the Southern Poverty Law Center for Communists.
[02:04:34.927 --> 02:04:36.768]  There's nobody to stand up for them.
[02:04:36.768 --> 02:04:37.989]  Christian churches don't care.
[02:04:37.989 --> 02:04:44.033]  They just sit up there like glitter bugs and, you know, try to get women to divorce their husbands so they can get more money and all that.
[02:04:44.033 --> 02:04:48.856]  I mean, and when they go to stand before God, God's going to send them straight to hell saying, I don't know you.
[02:04:48.856 --> 02:04:52.179]  They're all a bunch of 501c3 government whores.
[02:04:52.179 --> 02:04:57.082]  The Methodist Church in Austin promotes Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[02:04:57.082 --> 02:04:58.443]  I mean, these churches are enemies.
[02:04:59.844 --> 02:05:03.888]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:05:03.888 --> 02:05:08.232]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:05:08.232 --> 02:05:11.916]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:05:11.916 --> 02:05:14.959]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:05:14.959 --> 02:05:22.266]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:05:22.526 --> 02:05:26.430]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:05:26.430 --> 02:05:30.855]  You filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:05:30.855 --> 02:05:36.821]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:05:36.821 --> 02:05:40.785]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:05:40.785 --> 02:05:43.508]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:05:43.508 --> 02:05:44.869]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:05:44.969 --> 02:05:46.350]  It's time to take action.
[02:05:46.350 --> 02:05:48.171]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:06:05.153 --> 02:06:08.494]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[02:06:08.494 --> 02:06:10.595]  She's just not the woman I married.
[02:06:10.595 --> 02:06:12.756]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[02:06:12.756 --> 02:06:14.397]  Does this seem familiar?
[02:06:14.397 --> 02:06:17.738]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[02:06:17.738 --> 02:06:19.318]  If so, consider this.
[02:06:19.318 --> 02:06:28.242]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[02:06:28.602 --> 02:06:34.988]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.

[02:06:52.203 --> 02:06:52.964]  Live Life Healthy!
[02:07:00.248 --> 02:07:06.417]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:07:06.417 --> 02:07:10.984]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:07:10.984 --> 02:07:15.551]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:07:15.931 --> 02:07:18.872]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:07:18.872 --> 02:07:24.295]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:07:24.295 --> 02:07:31.698]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare-earth, deep-earth crystals.
[02:07:31.698 --> 02:07:35.840]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:07:35.840 --> 02:07:40.622]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:40.942 --> 02:07:41.462]  What's his name?
[02:08:24.382 --> 02:08:26.083]  There is a war.
[02:08:26.083 --> 02:08:27.884]  It's happening now.
[02:08:27.884 --> 02:08:30.306]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[02:08:30.306 --> 02:08:32.887]  The time to choose sides has come.
[02:08:32.887 --> 02:08:34.808]  We are the resistance.
[02:08:34.808 --> 02:08:36.389]  We are the Infowar.
[02:08:39.969 --> 02:08:44.390]  And it is Tuesday, already the 17th day of June 2014.
[02:08:44.390 --> 02:08:56.273]  We're going to go back to your calls after this groundbreaking live report at the Brownsville border crossing on the Texas side.
[02:08:56.273 --> 02:09:04.255]  We have our own Jakari Jackson, John Bowne, Joe Jennings, and Adon Salazar.
[02:09:04.255 --> 02:09:06.476]  And if you guys want to go over to the other side of the border,
[02:09:07.156 --> 02:09:10.318]  And show the illegals coming through later with a rented car.
[02:09:10.318 --> 02:09:12.879]  That's pretty dangerous because that is a failed state over there.
[02:09:12.879 --> 02:09:14.660]  Most dangerous in the world.
[02:09:14.660 --> 02:09:18.323]  Listed by the State Department in that particular border area that you're in.
[02:09:18.323 --> 02:09:20.964]  Most dangerous in the world.
[02:09:20.964 --> 02:09:25.467]  But again, if we criticize the illegals collapsing our border and running from that, we're bad.
[02:09:25.467 --> 02:09:28.669]  If we criticize everybody coming here and getting all these free goodies, we're bad.
[02:09:29.799 --> 02:09:32.901]  But that's a mission you can take if you choose to accept it.
[02:09:32.901 --> 02:09:34.602]  Now you've got other big fish to fry.
[02:09:34.602 --> 02:09:39.744]  You're going to be down there all week until Friday reporting on what's happening.
[02:09:39.744 --> 02:09:42.566]  You just talked to an ice whistleblower on the ground.
[02:09:42.566 --> 02:09:44.226]  You're going to tell us about that.
[02:09:44.226 --> 02:09:44.667]  And then...
[02:09:46.220 --> 02:09:47.621]  They're only about 50 yards away.
[02:09:47.621 --> 02:09:50.964]  They're going to march over to the Border Patrol facility.
[02:09:50.964 --> 02:09:52.786]  And we're not enemies of the Border Patrol.
[02:09:52.786 --> 02:09:56.629]  They've had their manpower cut way back to deal with illegals.
[02:09:56.629 --> 02:10:00.212]  They've been given the job of heating formula, changing diapers.
[02:10:00.212 --> 02:10:02.614]  We see the buses at that facility pulling in.
[02:10:02.614 --> 02:10:03.635]  The people aren't even checked.
[02:10:03.635 --> 02:10:04.135]  There's so many.
[02:10:04.135 --> 02:10:06.337]  They're then put on white vans.
[02:10:06.337 --> 02:10:08.779]  DrudgeReport.com linked to the story yesterday.
[02:10:08.779 --> 02:10:09.800]  It went viral.
[02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:13.764]  We have new videos with the churches admitting they're illegals, that they are protecting them.
[02:10:14.224 --> 02:10:25.679]  We have another article on InfoWars.com proving that indeed this is an Obama administration program with the churches in an act of human trafficking and treason.
[02:10:25.679 --> 02:10:29.685]  If I got caught shipping illegals in a van, it's a felony.
[02:10:29.685 --> 02:10:31.407]  But the churches are doing it in plain view.
[02:10:32.509 --> 02:10:37.853]  To bring this country down, ladies and gentlemen, and complete their total socialist takeover.
[02:10:37.853 --> 02:10:41.335]  And joining us again are John Bannon and Jakari Jackson reporting on the ground.
[02:10:41.335 --> 02:10:45.638]  If you're a radio listener, go to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:10:45.638 --> 02:10:48.581]  Infowars.com forward slash show to see the free feed.
[02:10:49.181 --> 02:10:55.224]  For the radio show, the nighttime TV show subscription, PrisonPlanet.TV, but this is important what's about to happen.
[02:10:55.224 --> 02:10:56.925]  Gentlemen, you've got the floor.
[02:10:56.925 --> 02:11:00.647]  Tell us about the ICE agent that Don was able to interview.
[02:11:00.647 --> 02:11:06.650]  We're going to not air the video until we blur out his face and alter his voice on the Nightly News tonight or tomorrow.
[02:11:06.650 --> 02:11:14.814]  Tell us what else has happened as we talked to you yesterday, and then let's go over there to the Border Patrol facility where they're basically on stand down.
[02:11:15.982 --> 02:11:19.425]  Yes, Alex, we're here at the border crossing in Brownsville, Texas.
[02:11:19.425 --> 02:11:22.888]  Now, as you alluded to, we just had an exclusive interview with an ICE agent.
[02:11:22.888 --> 02:11:25.270]  He wants to remain anonymous, and rightfully so.
[02:11:25.270 --> 02:11:28.593]  We've seen the gag orders come down, so he's trying to protect his identity.
[02:11:28.593 --> 02:11:36.880]  But we were talking to him, and I asked him a few questions, you know, about what's going on in this country, how people feel about it in the ranks, and he says morale is pretty low in ICE and border
[02:11:36.940 --> 02:11:37.440]  We're good to go.
[02:12:02.242 --> 02:12:04.283]  Incredible, Jakari.
[02:12:04.283 --> 02:12:07.644]  But I think this is breaking now in case they even try to get the tapes.
[02:12:07.644 --> 02:12:12.206]  Go ahead and tell us what else he said, and then we'll see the video itself later.
[02:12:12.206 --> 02:12:16.168]  Yeah, so he was telling us some of the hot spots to come and see on the border.
[02:12:16.168 --> 02:12:18.089]  You know, he said, you know, go a few miles this way or that way.
[02:12:18.089 --> 02:12:18.769]  Actually, don't give that away.
[02:12:18.769 --> 02:12:19.109]  You're right.
[02:12:19.109 --> 02:12:19.810]  You're right.
[02:12:19.810 --> 02:12:21.050]  I've got others.
[02:12:21.050 --> 02:12:23.772]  Don't tell folks where we're going tonight, where you're going tonight.
[02:12:23.772 --> 02:12:24.732]  Be careful.
[02:12:24.732 --> 02:12:27.073]  But seriously, folks, this is amazing.
[02:12:30.134 --> 02:12:32.715]  Let me just stop right there, Jakari.
[02:12:32.715 --> 02:12:35.697]  What else are you witnessing while you're there?
[02:12:35.697 --> 02:12:38.399]  Well, since we've come here, we're right here at the border crossing.
[02:12:38.399 --> 02:12:43.862]  As I pointed out yesterday, we were at the border crossing a few miles from here, and there were people
[02:12:44.986 --> 02:12:52.473]  Border Patrol agents coming up, or not so much talking to us, but they would pull up right beside our vehicle, lean into our vehicle, and it was somewhat humorous.
[02:12:52.473 --> 02:12:54.675]  Yesterday, we just filed a video report about this.
[02:12:54.675 --> 02:13:01.681]  We were trying to look for one of these illegal border crossings, and ICE agents, excuse me, not ICE, but Border Patrol agents actually began
[02:13:01.681 --> 02:13:02.361]  We're good to go.
[02:13:20.771 --> 02:13:34.557]  No, no, that's the pattern, is that they harass you for being in a hot spring at Big Bend, they harass you if you've got beer in your cooler, while the illegals in front of me were riding on horses and walking right past them and loading in vans and driving off.
[02:13:34.557 --> 02:13:37.798]  Because they've been told, leave them alone, only mess with U.S.
[02:13:37.798 --> 02:13:40.439]  citizens, we can get some money out of them.
[02:13:40.439 --> 02:13:43.820]  We're the ones they're looking for, and we're the ones they have the eagle eye for.
[02:13:43.820 --> 02:13:48.122]  It's come to the point to where the next illegal I run into, I want to ask him, hey,
[02:13:48.897 --> 02:13:51.838]  Would it be okay if we left so you can have the country?
[02:13:51.838 --> 02:13:54.799]  Would that be... Do you need us to go?
[02:13:54.799 --> 02:13:56.059]  You know, that work out for you?
[02:13:56.059 --> 02:13:58.580]  Well, then there's this argument, well, everybody's a settler.
[02:13:58.580 --> 02:13:59.960]  That was the age of conquest.
[02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:01.601]  Nobody could take the United States.
[02:14:01.601 --> 02:14:05.442]  The native tribes were all killing each other, trying to always take over from each other.
[02:14:05.442 --> 02:14:09.523]  I talked about that last week with the next decision, but nobody's endorsing what happened in the past.
[02:14:09.523 --> 02:14:17.886]  We have a socialist, globalist, social engineering government telling third world, unskilled women with five kids, come here and we'll bankroll you.
[02:14:18.246 --> 02:14:20.186]  Just vote for socialism.
[02:14:20.186 --> 02:14:21.527]  My God!
[02:14:21.527 --> 02:14:23.427]  This is a nightmare scenario!
[02:14:23.427 --> 02:14:29.248]  The New World Order that's funding Al Qaeda to take over the Middle East is for this.
[02:14:29.248 --> 02:14:30.969]  Is it a good idea?
[02:14:30.969 --> 02:14:36.490]  You've got the President of the United States today honoring the DREAM Act and those illegals coming over.
[02:14:36.490 --> 02:14:42.771]  Just handing the country over to them and it was Valerie Jarrett who said that they're the best and brightest of us.
[02:14:43.996 --> 02:14:44.777]  Foreigners.
[02:14:44.777 --> 02:14:47.358]  Here are some of these highlights.
[02:14:47.358 --> 02:14:48.980]  IG.
[02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:52.442]  IRS made a policy decision to legalize illegal aliens.
[02:14:52.442 --> 02:14:57.506]  Ended up paying illegals $4.2 billion in refundable credits in one year.
[02:14:57.506 --> 02:14:57.766]  Boom!
[02:14:58.820 --> 02:15:01.261]  That is CBS News.
[02:15:01.261 --> 02:15:02.141]  Another CBS.
[02:15:02.141 --> 02:15:07.082]  Arpaio, Border Patrol, is too busy changing diapers to go after illegal immigrants.
[02:15:07.082 --> 02:15:09.342]  The Justice Department is trying to have him arrested right now.
[02:15:09.342 --> 02:15:09.883]  Here's another one.
[02:15:09.883 --> 02:15:11.743]  Look at this woman with the baby.
[02:15:11.743 --> 02:15:17.484]  In Texas, Rio Grande Valley, a seemingly endless surge of immigrants because the green light has been given.
[02:15:17.484 --> 02:15:19.265]  Here's the article you mentioned.
[02:15:19.265 --> 02:15:21.765]  White House to honor young illegal immigrants.
[02:15:21.765 --> 02:15:24.746]  Jakari, John, more points you'd like to make.
[02:15:25.546 --> 02:15:28.930]  Well, uh, it's my understanding that John Bowden just received something extremely racist.
[02:15:28.930 --> 02:15:30.171]  Do you want to share that with us, John Bowden?
[02:15:30.171 --> 02:15:32.493]  Well, it's not quite a sombrero, but it's close.
[02:15:32.493 --> 02:15:34.876]  It's not quite a sombrero, but it's close.
[02:15:34.876 --> 02:15:38.480]  It's a, uh, what is this, a border patrol hat?
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:39.681]  So I would imagine that...
[02:15:40.675 --> 02:15:43.858]  Natural citizens like myself wouldn't be allowed to wear this.
[02:15:43.858 --> 02:15:48.001]  Well, you know you can't wear that on a college campus because you'd be racist against cowboys.
[02:15:48.001 --> 02:15:48.701]  Oh, that's right.
[02:15:48.701 --> 02:15:49.042]  Yeah.
[02:15:49.042 --> 02:15:52.024]  And you can't have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches at high schools.
[02:15:52.024 --> 02:15:52.945]  That's racist.
[02:15:52.945 --> 02:15:59.430]  Everything's racist code except screaming, we are the race, for those in the race, everything, for those outside the race, nothing.
[02:15:59.430 --> 02:16:02.252]  La Raza, that's okay.
[02:16:02.252 --> 02:16:07.877]  Yeah, La Raza, which is backed up by Bill and Melinda Gates and the Ford Foundation,
[02:16:08.496 --> 02:16:11.738]  Which we might be interested in speaking with here pretty soon as well.
[02:16:11.738 --> 02:16:12.979]  They have an office here in Texas.
[02:16:12.979 --> 02:16:22.745]  Who are funding, under Bill and Melinda Gates, the forced inoculation of all 12-year-old Mexican girls, and it's linked directly to being sterilized, death, and autoimmune disorders.
[02:16:22.745 --> 02:16:31.631]  So, instead of the La Raza groups trying to save their little girls from being sterilized, they'd rather have them flood up here to politically take our guns.
[02:16:32.847 --> 02:16:33.409]  That's right.
[02:16:33.409 --> 02:16:35.996]  As long as they can vote, yeah.
[02:16:35.996 --> 02:16:38.563]  When they become of age to vote, yeah, they'll be perfect.
[02:16:39.221 --> 02:16:41.603]  Right, and Alex, you were asking us about what happened with that ice interview.
[02:16:41.603 --> 02:16:43.804]  I guess I have one more tidbit we could throw out there.
[02:16:43.804 --> 02:16:47.427]  We talked to this ice agent, and we said, you know, are people coming in with illnesses?
[02:16:47.427 --> 02:16:49.628]  He said, yes, there are people coming in with illnesses.
[02:16:49.628 --> 02:16:52.450]  And I said, well, you know, what's the most common type of thing you see?
[02:16:52.450 --> 02:16:57.073]  And he said, well, from these Central American countries, we see people come in with tuberculosis.
[02:16:57.073 --> 02:16:59.775]  And I said, well, what type of medical procedures do you have for that?
[02:16:59.775 --> 02:17:01.336]  He said, well, we give them chest x-rays.
[02:17:01.336 --> 02:17:02.877]  We do all these other types of things.
[02:17:02.877 --> 02:17:07.160]  And John and I, we were sitting there like, whoa, what about the veterans at the VA?
[02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:07.740]  What about me?
[02:17:07.740 --> 02:17:09.121]  Hey, if I get tuberculosis,
[02:17:09.161 --> 02:17:11.142]  Well, let's expand on that.
[02:17:11.142 --> 02:17:14.145]  If you have drug-resistant TB, you're not allowed to fly.
[02:17:14.145 --> 02:17:15.225]  And you shouldn't be.
[02:17:15.225 --> 02:17:19.548]  In fact, they lock people up that have the drug-immune stuff because it'll cause a pandemic.
[02:17:19.548 --> 02:17:22.130]  And where do they have the worst tuberculosis in the world?
[02:17:22.130 --> 02:17:23.531]  Central and South America.
[02:17:23.531 --> 02:17:24.892]  See, people haven't been down there.
[02:17:24.892 --> 02:17:30.116]  My dad's been on a bunch of aid missions down there, you know, taking care of, you know, little kids and stuff.
[02:17:30.116 --> 02:17:31.197]  It is literal.
[02:17:31.197 --> 02:17:32.938]  He's been to Paraguay and places.
[02:17:32.938 --> 02:17:33.958]  The green hell.
[02:17:33.958 --> 02:17:36.780]  It is literally hell on earth.
[02:17:36.780 --> 02:17:38.702]  And all these dumb yuppies have no idea.
[02:17:39.685 --> 02:17:40.426]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:17:40.426 --> 02:17:42.647]  And he said, you know, it lowers the morale.
[02:17:42.647 --> 02:17:46.490]  It also makes them concerned there at the facilities that they're bringing in people with these diseases.
[02:17:46.490 --> 02:17:47.551]  Well, put out the video.
[02:17:47.551 --> 02:17:49.473]  I know you guys are working around the clock and you're getting bonuses.
[02:17:49.473 --> 02:17:50.754]  You've done a great job.
[02:17:50.754 --> 02:17:53.436]  Put out the video for Hazard Duty down there.
[02:17:53.436 --> 02:17:55.717]  Put out the video separately with the ICE guy.
[02:17:55.717 --> 02:18:00.921]  You know, ICE whistleblower says serious diseases or drug, you know, TB coming across.
[02:18:00.921 --> 02:18:05.185]  You know, get into that and then show articles about the drug-resistant TB so folks know it's not made up.
[02:18:06.105 --> 02:18:10.407]  And then put out the part about how they're basically on stand down.
[02:18:10.407 --> 02:18:11.428]  That is incredible.
[02:18:11.428 --> 02:18:12.428]  People need to know it.
[02:18:12.428 --> 02:18:13.328]  It's one thing to know it.
[02:18:13.328 --> 02:18:14.829]  It's another thing to actually see it.
[02:18:14.829 --> 02:18:16.270]  Now, add in the other points.
[02:18:16.270 --> 02:18:19.331]  We're going to skip this network break, so stations shouldn't play over this.
[02:18:19.331 --> 02:18:20.452]  We're skipping the network break.
[02:18:21.152 --> 02:18:25.935]  At the cost of like $3,000, but this is what I do because this information is too important.
[02:18:25.935 --> 02:18:40.425]  I want to skip this network break, this four minute break, the long break coming up, and I want you guys to turn and walk in there and ask some questions of the Border Patrol about what type of infectious diseases are coming across, why have you been following us, the media.
[02:18:40.425 --> 02:18:41.166]  Don't be their enemy.
[02:18:41.166 --> 02:18:42.947]  Say we know you've been ordered to stand down.
[02:18:42.947 --> 02:18:44.969]  We know you're one of the few constitutional federal agencies.
[02:18:45.729 --> 02:18:46.349]  Do the talking.
[02:18:46.349 --> 02:18:48.850]  Say, hold on, let us do our questions and we'll go.
[02:18:48.850 --> 02:18:51.031]  Or let us talk to your public information officer.
[02:18:51.031 --> 02:18:56.273]  And finally say to them, we have video of buses coming and people loading off.
[02:18:56.273 --> 02:18:58.154]  We followed those vans to churches.
[02:18:58.154 --> 02:18:59.995]  Do you want to know where the illegals are?
[02:18:59.995 --> 02:19:02.336]  And they're going to tell you, no, we don't.
[02:19:02.336 --> 02:19:10.999]  So, we need to illustrate to everyone, so that when you get pulled over and a cop wants to search your car without a warrant, it's all a joke.
[02:19:10.999 --> 02:19:12.360]  It's all a fraud.
[02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:14.301]  Any other points before you march across the street, guys?
[02:19:15.563 --> 02:19:17.524]  No, I'm ready to do this.
[02:19:17.524 --> 02:19:18.725]  I think we're both ready to go here.
[02:19:18.725 --> 02:19:24.688]  All right, you guys take over and you're in charge now for the next 10 minutes.
[02:19:24.688 --> 02:19:26.349]  I'm gonna try to not jump on your ear too much.
[02:19:26.349 --> 02:19:28.450]  Just, just, just, I trust you.
[02:19:28.450 --> 02:19:29.431]  Just get in there.
[02:19:29.431 --> 02:19:31.252]  Don't let them control the situation.
[02:19:31.252 --> 02:19:32.293]  Get the questions out.
[02:19:32.293 --> 02:19:32.413]  Go!
[02:19:33.328 --> 02:19:33.888]  Okay, here we go.
[02:19:33.888 --> 02:19:34.929]  Let everybody know where we are.
[02:19:34.929 --> 02:19:39.332]  All right, so once again, if you're just now joining us, I'll get a shot of that so people can see.
[02:19:39.332 --> 02:19:40.852]  Welcome to the United States of America.
[02:19:40.852 --> 02:19:42.213]  Yeah, welcome to the United States.
[02:19:42.213 --> 02:19:44.435]  Anyway, this is Brownsville, Texas.
[02:19:44.435 --> 02:19:46.136]  This is the site of a Border Patrol crossing.
[02:19:46.136 --> 02:19:49.818]  We'll try to get across the street right here.
[02:19:49.818 --> 02:19:53.280]  So we're moving in, trying to get a word with a Border Patrol agent.
[02:19:53.280 --> 02:19:56.962]  Maybe a police officer here already waiting for us at the front.
[02:19:56.962 --> 02:19:58.503]  We're just trying to get across the street right here.
[02:19:58.503 --> 02:19:59.943]  There's a gentleman at the door.
[02:19:59.943 --> 02:20:02.365]  Maybe he can point us to the Public Information Office.
[02:20:03.365 --> 02:20:05.810]  You can see the Border Patrol crossing right there.
[02:20:05.810 --> 02:20:07.373]  We may not- Look, look.
[02:20:07.373 --> 02:20:09.717]  The gentleman, Mr. Perez, is telling us that we cannot come in.
[02:20:09.717 --> 02:20:12.483]  Mr. Perez, can we- Can we get a word, Mr. Perez?
[02:20:12.483 --> 02:20:13.505]  Are you saying that we cannot come in?
[02:20:13.505 --> 02:20:14.086]  Is that what you're saying?
[02:20:15.063 --> 02:20:15.904]  Sir?
[02:20:15.904 --> 02:20:16.864]  You waved your fingers.
[02:20:16.864 --> 02:20:18.766]  That's saying that we cannot... I was saying hello.
[02:20:18.766 --> 02:20:19.406]  Oh, you're saying hello.
[02:20:19.406 --> 02:20:19.846]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[02:20:19.846 --> 02:20:21.267]  I didn't want to mis-contrue what you're saying.
[02:20:21.267 --> 02:20:23.649]  Is there a public information officer we can speak to?
[02:20:23.649 --> 02:20:24.370]  That is me, sir.
[02:20:24.370 --> 02:20:24.710]  Oh, that is you.
[02:20:24.710 --> 02:20:26.331]  Can I ask you to turn the camera off, please?
[02:20:26.331 --> 02:20:28.192]  Oh, can we talk to you out here?
[02:20:28.192 --> 02:20:28.493]  Sure.
[02:20:28.493 --> 02:20:28.733]  Great.
[02:20:28.733 --> 02:20:30.194]  All right, Alex, we're going to talk to this gentleman.
[02:20:30.194 --> 02:20:33.916]  Is this the same place I saw the illegals yesterday in that video you filed?
[02:20:33.916 --> 02:20:35.518]  No, no, this is a different... Oh, we can't come in?
[02:20:35.518 --> 02:20:36.638]  No, talk to him.
[02:20:36.638 --> 02:20:37.519]  I can come in.
[02:20:37.519 --> 02:20:40.181]  Okay, well, I'll leave this with John Bell.
[02:20:41.065 --> 02:20:43.886]  The gentleman's saying I can come in and I will rejoin you guys here shortly.
[02:20:43.886 --> 02:20:50.450]  Well, listen, here's the problem, Jakari, is that we don't want to get you guys cut off, so call him... Listen, I don't want to get shut down on this.
[02:20:50.450 --> 02:20:53.871]  I want to go back across the other street now and talk to the Border Patrol people.
[02:20:53.871 --> 02:20:55.512]  Okay.
[02:20:55.512 --> 02:20:57.073]  Uh... Oh, so look, he's emptying his stuff out.
[02:20:57.073 --> 02:20:59.954]  I guess you go do it, Bowne.
[02:20:59.954 --> 02:21:05.937]  Yeah, I'll go... I don't want to sit here and play, you know, AWACS quarterback while you guys are on the front lines, but, uh...
[02:21:06.906 --> 02:21:09.807]  You know, Jakari wants to go through the checkpoint and everything.
[02:21:09.807 --> 02:21:12.028]  Unless he has a hidden camera, it's almost pointless.
[02:21:12.028 --> 02:21:14.149]  I want to go over to the Border Patrol themselves.
[02:21:14.149 --> 02:21:15.950]  I don't want to get shut down by their bureaucracy.
[02:21:15.950 --> 02:21:16.370]  Yeah.
[02:21:16.370 --> 02:21:18.131]  Let's start walking, fellas.
[02:21:18.131 --> 02:21:19.892]  Okay.
[02:21:19.892 --> 02:21:23.914]  Let's go to the actual crossing itself.
[02:21:23.914 --> 02:21:26.535]  Here we go.
[02:21:26.535 --> 02:21:28.576]  Now this is all federal property.
[02:21:29.636 --> 02:21:32.337]  Which means slaves aren't allowed to be there, only illegal aliens.
[02:21:32.337 --> 02:21:39.360]  It's supposed to be, you know, my property, your property, but, uh, I'm sure they'll have a different preference.
[02:21:39.360 --> 02:21:46.363]  Yeah, just go over and say you want to report a bunch of illegals where the vans have gone from the safe houses.
[02:21:46.363 --> 02:21:49.885]  Excuse me, sir!
[02:21:49.885 --> 02:21:55.227]  Yeah, this is InfoWars reporters from Brownsville, Texas, on the border, trying to talk to someone, illustrating.
[02:21:55.227 --> 02:21:56.247]  By the way, I've been down there before.
[02:21:56.247 --> 02:21:57.428]  You speak like an anthill of police.
[02:21:57.428 --> 02:21:57.948]  Yeah, we're live.
[02:22:01.427 --> 02:22:03.249]  I just want to report some illegals.
[02:22:03.249 --> 02:22:04.109]  This guy has a gun.
[02:22:04.109 --> 02:22:06.131]  This guy has an assault rifle.
[02:22:06.131 --> 02:22:06.771]  Let's go talk to him.
[02:22:06.771 --> 02:22:08.332]  Go talk to him.
[02:22:08.332 --> 02:22:11.375]  Yeah, they're ordering us to step back.
[02:22:11.375 --> 02:22:14.357]  I just want to report some illegals to help you guys out.
[02:22:14.357 --> 02:22:17.620]  John, I would go talk to them or they'll get really aggressive.
[02:22:17.620 --> 02:22:20.742]  I would let them walk to you.
[02:22:20.742 --> 02:22:22.583]  Because if you do that, I know their psychology.
[02:22:22.583 --> 02:22:23.064]  It's literally
[02:22:24.673 --> 02:22:25.894]  You need to go talk to them.
[02:22:25.894 --> 02:22:26.734]  Oh my goodness.
[02:22:26.734 --> 02:22:27.574]  Or they're going to ignore you.
[02:22:27.574 --> 02:22:28.195]  This is what they do.
[02:22:28.195 --> 02:22:33.597]  That's why the mainstream media can't ever get questions in because they just control the whole situation.
[02:22:33.597 --> 02:22:36.178]  Yeah, there's a sheriff.
[02:22:36.178 --> 02:22:40.000]  Well, they report them to the police all the time and to the Border Patrol and they won't come get them.
[02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:43.601]  Go over to that Border Patrol vehicle over there and go talk to them.
[02:22:43.601 --> 02:22:45.202]  Jumping, springing into action.
[02:22:45.202 --> 02:22:47.843]  Yeah, I mean those guys freak out when they see a citizen in a camera.
[02:22:47.843 --> 02:22:48.983]  Go over and talk to them.
[02:22:48.983 --> 02:22:50.584]  I guess that's what they do best.
[02:22:50.584 --> 02:22:52.165]  And they start yelling at you, let them walk to you.
[02:22:53.857 --> 02:22:56.198]  So what if they wave a gun around?
[02:22:56.198 --> 02:22:57.599]  I let the Secret Service do that to me.
[02:22:57.599 --> 02:22:58.019]  Yeah, I'm here.
[02:22:58.019 --> 02:23:00.120]  Good job, John.
[02:23:00.120 --> 02:23:02.861]  Go on over and talk to that Border Patrol right there.
[02:23:02.861 --> 02:23:04.381]  Just go to the stop sign and call them over.
[02:23:04.381 --> 02:23:07.603]  Okay.
[02:23:07.603 --> 02:23:11.865]  Well... Excuse me, sir?
[02:23:11.865 --> 02:23:13.465]  Yeah, they lost our audio connection to them.
[02:23:13.465 --> 02:23:14.326]  No, I've got you.
[02:23:14.326 --> 02:23:15.346]  I've got you now.
[02:23:15.346 --> 02:23:17.567]  Excuse me, sir?
[02:23:17.567 --> 02:23:22.069]  Just go closer and tell them you want to report shipments of illegal aliens being smuggled in.
[02:23:26.977 --> 02:23:32.619]  Could I, uh, have some assistance here from our federal government?
[02:23:32.619 --> 02:23:33.200]  You got U.S.
[02:23:33.200 --> 02:23:34.460]  Customs Border Protection right here.
[02:23:34.460 --> 02:23:39.782]  Well, John, you need to go back and you need to go find the guy with the assault rifle and have him talk to you.
[02:23:39.782 --> 02:23:41.263]  Oh, he's, uh, he's outside now.
[02:23:41.263 --> 02:23:43.764]  He's, he's, uh... Good, go over to him.
[02:23:43.764 --> 02:23:46.785]  Here, alright, here we go.
[02:23:46.785 --> 02:23:47.405]  Yeah, you're fine.
[02:23:47.405 --> 02:23:49.126]  Just let them walk to you once you're there.
[02:23:49.126 --> 02:23:50.467]  Yeah, he's, he's got Jakari.
[02:23:50.467 --> 02:23:51.787]  He's bringing him over.
[02:23:51.787 --> 02:23:52.508]  Good.
[02:23:52.508 --> 02:23:54.668]  He's, uh... See, Jakari walked over to him.
[02:23:54.668 --> 02:23:55.729]  Go over there.
[02:23:55.729 --> 02:23:55.869]  Yep.
[02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:05.709]  Anyways, that's ridiculous how this country... I really wish I had a sombrero on right now, I'll tell you what.
[02:24:05.709 --> 02:24:09.793]  Well, that would probably be the answer, is to literally go across and become an illegal alien.
[02:24:09.793 --> 02:24:15.339]  Okay, let's get Jakari plugged in and we'll find out what we were instructed.
[02:24:15.339 --> 02:24:16.060]  Okay, anyway...
[02:24:17.336 --> 02:24:19.338]  Yeah, this time you guys stay together.
[02:24:37.418 --> 02:24:37.858]  Right, right.
[02:24:37.858 --> 02:24:38.579]  Go ahead.
[02:24:38.579 --> 02:24:41.340]  But the thing, he said, you have to do this the proper way.
[02:24:41.340 --> 02:24:43.101]  I said, sir, well, how do we do this the proper way?
[02:24:43.101 --> 02:24:45.722]  He said, well, first of all, can you get your crew back across the street?
[02:24:45.722 --> 02:24:48.123]  I said, all right, sir, we'll abide by your wishes.
[02:24:48.123 --> 02:24:49.824]  I'll go back and talk to him here in a second.
[02:24:49.824 --> 02:24:51.605]  But first, we'll move across the street.
[02:24:51.605 --> 02:24:53.145]  And he said, you have to do this the proper way.
[02:24:53.145 --> 02:24:54.486]  And I said, well, what is that?
[02:24:54.486 --> 02:24:56.127]  He said, you have to tell me what you're doing here.
[02:24:56.127 --> 02:24:57.567]  I said, sir, I'd love to tell you what I'm doing here.
[02:24:57.567 --> 02:24:59.468]  We're trying to show you this video and so forth.
[02:24:59.468 --> 02:25:00.829]  He said, well, I can't comment on that.
[02:25:00.829 --> 02:25:02.650]  I can't give you any information for 21 days.
[02:25:03.670 --> 02:25:06.972]  I said, you're the public information officer, but you can't give me anything for 21 days.
[02:25:06.972 --> 02:25:08.454]  I said, is that standard procedure?
[02:25:08.454 --> 02:25:09.654]  He said, yes it is.
[02:25:09.654 --> 02:25:15.138]  So now with that, I will go back here and talk to this gentleman, and I'll tell you what I found out here in just a few moments.
[02:25:15.138 --> 02:25:16.139]  Well, listen, they're not going to stop us.
[02:25:16.139 --> 02:25:17.800]  We shouldn't have split up.
[02:25:17.800 --> 02:25:25.906]  And bottom line, we need to show them up front saying they can't talk to you, you can't report the crimes being committed, because they know the crimes that are being committed.
[02:25:25.906 --> 02:25:32.771]  You need to go find Border Patrol in their vehicles and go knock on their windows and say, here is the address of the safe houses.
[02:25:33.371 --> 02:25:42.934]  You know full well, and put them on record, this is to illustrate, because people know this is going on, it's admitted, but we have to visually illustrate it to the American people.
[02:25:42.934 --> 02:25:47.375]  Now, is that the same facility where the buses come in and they load on the vans?
[02:25:47.375 --> 02:25:49.576]  I have not seen any buses as of yet.
[02:25:49.576 --> 02:25:51.517]  No, that's in McAllen, Texas.
[02:25:51.517 --> 02:25:57.438]  I mean, I want to go show that and point out where that's going on to these people.
[02:25:57.438 --> 02:26:01.700]  We found an even better facility, and we're going to go to that next.
[02:26:01.700 --> 02:26:02.740]  It's actually very close.
[02:26:03.649 --> 02:26:06.651]  And by better, you mean they're more out of control?
[02:26:06.651 --> 02:26:11.014]  Well, by better, that it's where they're processing all of the illegals they catch.
[02:26:11.014 --> 02:26:11.994]  And they dump them out at night?
[02:26:11.994 --> 02:26:12.755]  Right.
[02:26:12.755 --> 02:26:13.055]  Right.
[02:26:13.055 --> 02:26:17.678]  Alright, well I'm going to head back in here and see if I can get another word with Mr. Press.
[02:26:17.678 --> 02:26:19.119]  I'll leave you in job balance.
[02:26:19.119 --> 02:26:21.000]  Alright, they're just going to brush you off, but okay.
[02:26:21.690 --> 02:26:22.550]  Yeah, good luck.
[02:26:22.550 --> 02:26:24.291]  Oh yeah, he has my identification.
[02:26:24.291 --> 02:26:27.211]  He was asking to see my ID, so I... Oh no, I know you gotta get it back.
[02:26:27.211 --> 02:26:28.671]  That's fantastic.
[02:26:28.671 --> 02:26:31.972]  But I mean, the whole point is, you can tell our reporters what they say.
[02:26:31.972 --> 02:26:33.893]  That'll be in the article, how you were brushed off.
[02:26:33.893 --> 02:26:37.633]  And say, you're not gonna let me report federal crime.
[02:26:37.633 --> 02:26:39.934]  And then have him refuse to take it.
[02:26:39.934 --> 02:26:44.255]  No grand jury's gonna indict him, but the point is, it's an illustration of what's going on here.
[02:26:44.255 --> 02:26:44.915]  Okay?
[02:26:44.915 --> 02:26:45.315]  Right.
[02:26:45.315 --> 02:26:45.595]  Good job.
[02:26:47.162 --> 02:26:47.662]  There you go.
[02:26:47.662 --> 02:26:49.644]  And it's going on at all these churches.
[02:26:49.644 --> 02:26:50.505]  We have their names.
[02:26:50.505 --> 02:26:51.486]  We have the video.
[02:26:51.486 --> 02:26:53.367]  And they're just like, well, it's churches.
[02:26:53.367 --> 02:26:56.070]  You know, they're just helping.
[02:26:56.070 --> 02:26:57.231]  John Bowne, what do you think about this?
[02:26:58.853 --> 02:27:01.954]  Uh, it's getting worse and worse, Alex.
[02:27:01.954 --> 02:27:08.636]  It's amazing how the illegals have pretty much taken control of this entire area of Texas.
[02:27:08.636 --> 02:27:11.237]  And their rights are more important than mine.
[02:27:11.237 --> 02:27:12.378]  And I was born in this country.
[02:27:12.378 --> 02:27:17.860]  Hey, 15 miles into Arizona, they have signs saying, do not enter this area controlled by cartels.
[02:27:17.860 --> 02:27:18.980]  This country's gone.
[02:27:18.980 --> 02:27:19.600]  We're a joke.
[02:27:19.600 --> 02:27:20.060]  Go ahead.
[02:27:20.060 --> 02:27:21.661]  My blood fought for this country.
[02:27:21.661 --> 02:27:25.062]  My grandfather, my great-grandfather, and then all the way back.
[02:27:25.622 --> 02:27:30.444]  I fought for this country and I'm garbage.
[02:27:30.444 --> 02:27:31.865]  Well, the point is there is no country.
[02:27:31.865 --> 02:27:36.087]  We are a corporate defecation facility.
[02:27:36.087 --> 02:27:39.809]  I mean, we're just here for anything because we put up with it.
[02:27:39.809 --> 02:27:42.710]  America was great because we didn't put up with any garbage.
[02:27:42.710 --> 02:27:45.091]  Now we're pathetic because we put up with everything.
[02:27:45.091 --> 02:27:48.673]  We're a nation of compliers, a nation of grovelers, a nation of slaves.
[02:27:49.411 --> 02:27:56.873]  Yeah, and it's the New World Order's chessboard, and they're using their pieces right now, and we're just the pawns that need to be taken off the board.
[02:27:56.873 --> 02:28:02.634]  And I'd say the illegals are a bigger chess piece, and completely funded.
[02:28:02.634 --> 02:28:10.135]  The illegals, people with no rights, who should have tremendous respect for any American they meet, they look down their noses at us when they get here.
[02:28:10.135 --> 02:28:14.456]  Well, that's because all nationalism is allowed but Americana.
[02:28:14.456 --> 02:28:14.856]  Right.
[02:28:14.856 --> 02:28:17.197]  This is the nation where men are taught to be metrosexual,
[02:28:18.283 --> 02:28:21.406]  This is the nation where we're taught to be slaves.
[02:28:21.406 --> 02:28:24.028]  Yeah, and weak.
[02:28:24.028 --> 02:28:31.754]  By the way, the last thing those guys want is a scene with reporters trying to report on how the border is wide open.
[02:28:31.754 --> 02:28:35.277]  So, believe me, you guys aren't doing anything wrong when they sit there and wave.
[02:28:38.336 --> 02:28:46.699]  There's so many Border Patrol vans around here and trucks that we can definitely start shooting an illustration by showing them that video.
[02:28:46.699 --> 02:28:47.759]  That's absolutely what we need to do.
[02:28:47.759 --> 02:28:53.382]  But you're not allowed as a citizen to talk to them, so what you need to do is maybe go across the border and come back when they're questioning you.
[02:28:53.382 --> 02:28:57.203]  Pull your cameras out and say, yeah, let me show you where the illegals are.
[02:28:57.203 --> 02:28:59.084]  We can tell you a few miles from here.
[02:28:59.084 --> 02:29:02.345]  You've got to make them face-to-face show the hypocrisy.
[02:29:03.061 --> 02:29:06.463]  Yeah, I think we need a giant Infowars flag on our car.
[02:29:06.463 --> 02:29:10.544]  That might wake them up.
[02:29:10.544 --> 02:29:14.386]  Well, I mean, in their defense, they are talking to us privately.
[02:29:14.386 --> 02:29:15.467]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:29:15.467 --> 02:29:20.249]  And they've got the assault rifle guy right next to them.
[02:29:20.249 --> 02:29:23.870]  They want to make an American afraid.
[02:29:23.870 --> 02:29:25.091]  Wait, they got the guy with the gun?
[02:29:25.091 --> 02:29:27.792]  He's standing there right next to them.
[02:29:27.792 --> 02:29:29.433]  I mean, did he try to bow up to you when you were over there?
[02:29:30.269 --> 02:29:32.050]  I didn't get close enough to him for that.
[02:29:32.050 --> 02:29:32.570]  I wish I had.
[02:29:32.570 --> 02:29:33.831]  Go over and talk to him, man.
[02:29:33.831 --> 02:29:35.091]  You're a human.
[02:29:35.091 --> 02:29:36.812]  They come over like McGruff the Crime Dog.
[02:29:36.812 --> 02:29:37.412]  Just laugh at them.
[02:29:37.412 --> 02:29:38.293]  These guys are human.
[02:29:38.293 --> 02:29:39.834]  I'm a human.
[02:29:39.834 --> 02:29:40.194]  Right?
[02:29:40.194 --> 02:29:44.296]  I mean, I'd go up to those guys all over the place.
[02:29:44.296 --> 02:29:47.017]  They're all a bunch of zombies, it looks like to me.
[02:29:47.017 --> 02:29:47.477]  Whatever.
[02:29:47.477 --> 02:29:49.118]  We'll be right back with more on the other side.
[02:29:49.118 --> 02:29:50.518]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.518 --> 02:29:53.040]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.040 --> 02:29:55.721]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.592 --> 02:30:02.874]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[02:30:02.874 --> 02:30:10.298]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[02:30:10.298 --> 02:30:21.126]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[02:30:21.126 --> 02:30:30.372]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[02:30:31.092 --> 02:30:35.155]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[02:30:35.155 --> 02:30:38.937]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[02:30:38.937 --> 02:30:40.978]  Experience the new formula.
[02:30:40.978 --> 02:30:43.560]  Experience the ancient purity.
[02:30:43.560 --> 02:30:44.880]  Shield your family.
[02:30:44.880 --> 02:30:46.702]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:30:46.702 --> 02:30:49.883]  Available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:30:49.883 --> 02:30:53.846]  X2 from InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:30:59.031 --> 02:31:06.198]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:31:06.198 --> 02:31:08.541]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:31:08.541 --> 02:31:13.826]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:31:13.826 --> 02:31:18.771]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:31:18.991 --> 02:31:22.314]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:31:22.314 --> 02:31:26.398]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:31:26.398 --> 02:31:30.723]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:31:30.723 --> 02:31:40.952]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:31:40.952 --> 02:31:43.475]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:31:43.655 --> 02:31:51.859]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:31:51.859 --> 02:31:55.821]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:31:58.959 --> 02:32:05.104]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about a potential foreclosure situation?
[02:32:05.104 --> 02:32:08.406]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[02:32:08.406 --> 02:32:10.168]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[02:32:10.168 --> 02:32:16.552]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[02:32:16.552 --> 02:32:22.437]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[02:32:22.597 --> 02:32:26.539]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[02:32:26.539 --> 02:32:29.621]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[02:32:29.621 --> 02:32:37.906]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[02:32:37.906 --> 02:32:39.987]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[02:32:39.987 --> 02:32:41.028]  It's a war against the truth.
[02:32:41.408 --> 02:32:50.354]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.TV and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[02:32:50.354 --> 02:32:52.996]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.
[02:32:52.996 --> 02:32:57.299]  Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war to the next level.
[02:33:14.266 --> 02:33:21.568]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:21.568 --> 02:33:25.529]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.529 --> 02:33:30.610]  Well, Obama and the globalists are invading Iraq with their giant Saudi Arabian Al Qaeda army.
[02:33:30.610 --> 02:33:35.751]  They're invading us here with poor mothers dragging three or four kids behind them.
[02:33:35.751 --> 02:33:40.892]  Ready to vote, to take our guns and fully enslave us.
[02:33:40.892 --> 02:33:42.993]  And then we'll just collapse like any other third world country.
[02:33:45.011 --> 02:33:47.554]  Going back to Jakari Jackson and John Bowne on the border.
[02:33:47.554 --> 02:33:49.677]  Doing a great job.
[02:33:49.677 --> 02:33:55.365]  They've been filing multiple reports in text and video every day for this broadcast and the nightly news 7 o'clock central.
[02:33:55.365 --> 02:33:58.268]  You'll be able to see that at Infowarsnews.com tonight.
[02:33:59.605 --> 02:34:05.007]  The big breaking news will be tonight and tomorrow with the ice whistle blower and all the other stuff they're about to do.
[02:34:05.007 --> 02:34:06.268]  So be safe guys.
[02:34:06.268 --> 02:34:09.850]  What you're doing tonight is what is dangerous.
[02:34:09.850 --> 02:34:15.332]  Walking over to those guys, big deal they got an M16 across their chest.
[02:34:15.332 --> 02:34:16.492]  You know, or saying get back.
[02:34:16.492 --> 02:34:18.793]  I mean, just stand there and let them come to you.
[02:34:18.793 --> 02:34:21.735]  I drive through those border checkpoints all the time and stick cameras in their faces.
[02:34:22.755 --> 02:34:25.516]  Uh, and we're here to expose the criminal activity and report a crime.
[02:34:25.516 --> 02:34:30.999]  Uh, but let me guess, Shikari, they're not going to talk to you now that they got your ID and stuff.
[02:34:30.999 --> 02:34:32.259]  No, that is exactly right.
[02:34:32.259 --> 02:34:35.561]  He said just send them an email and they'll get back to us when they get back to us.
[02:34:35.561 --> 02:34:37.082]  When hell freezes over.
[02:34:37.082 --> 02:34:39.703]  Yeah.
[02:34:39.703 --> 02:34:41.864]  Because you are seen as a joke.
[02:34:41.864 --> 02:34:44.905]  You are seen as an American turd.
[02:34:44.905 --> 02:34:46.406]  I am seen as an American turd as well.
[02:34:48.988 --> 02:34:50.149]  Yeah, so that's pretty much it.
[02:34:50.149 --> 02:34:51.931]  You know, it was a big smoke and mirrors.
[02:34:51.931 --> 02:34:57.756]  They were much more concerned with what the crew was doing out there on the grounds than, you know, what I was doing on the inside.
[02:34:57.756 --> 02:35:02.680]  Well, I mean, they see John Bowne, you, Don Salazar, me as garbage.
[02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:06.963]  We are seen as just there to pay the bills, and it's over.
[02:35:06.963 --> 02:35:09.285]  I mean, the country's going into the North American Union.
[02:35:09.285 --> 02:35:11.307]  The deal was signed to get rid of the borders.
[02:35:11.307 --> 02:35:11.948]  It's happening.
[02:35:11.948 --> 02:35:15.471]  Can you imagine if they let this flood in, how big the next flood will be?
[02:35:16.380 --> 02:35:20.982]  Yeah, these morons don't operate by laws anymore, Alex, or rights, or even common sense.
[02:35:20.982 --> 02:35:26.324]  It's all about fear, and I own you, and step back.
[02:35:26.324 --> 02:35:28.644]  And they're wrong.
[02:35:28.644 --> 02:35:38.328]  Yeah, well make sure you get high-def, blown up with the guys and everything, and I would, it's your side of the street over there, I would go over there and get all the footage you can from the edge of the area there, and show what's going on.
[02:35:38.328 --> 02:35:44.510]  You guys want to drive into the other side and drive back through and ask them, hey, we have footage of illegals in their safe house, and just have them-
[02:35:44.770 --> 02:35:54.892]  You guys weren't interested in seeing what I was trying to show the guy the video on there and he just, you know, I'm a... I can't give you... No, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, but a picture tells a thousand words, video tells a million.
[02:35:54.892 --> 02:35:57.793]  If you... They will not stop at your window.
[02:35:57.793 --> 02:35:59.113]  They'll say, shut it off.
[02:35:59.113 --> 02:36:01.533]  You say, I will once you look at this.
[02:36:01.533 --> 02:36:06.074]  I want to file a report of where the illegals are going and their safe houses.
[02:36:06.074 --> 02:36:07.895]  And then you say the name of the churches.
[02:36:07.895 --> 02:36:09.975]  And then they say, no, get out of here.
[02:36:09.975 --> 02:36:11.335]  That's the footage.
[02:36:11.335 --> 02:36:12.496]  That's the gold.
[02:36:12.496 --> 02:36:13.416]  That's the money shot.
[02:36:13.416 --> 02:36:13.736]  Go ahead.
[02:36:15.242 --> 02:36:15.964]  We'll see what we can do.
[02:36:15.964 --> 02:36:18.250]  Oh, we'll get a lot of those, actually, Alex.
[02:36:18.250 --> 02:36:20.194]  We'll start here and we'll keep going.
[02:36:20.583 --> 02:36:22.984]  By the way, you're doing a great job with what you've got coming up tonight.
[02:36:22.984 --> 02:36:24.825]  And you don't have to do any of this if you don't want to.
[02:36:24.825 --> 02:36:26.685]  You guys, it was your idea to go down there.
[02:36:26.685 --> 02:36:29.546]  I'm just saying, I would go over to the Mexico side.
[02:36:29.546 --> 02:36:35.608]  It's so hellishly dangerous, you might just show, you know, out of the car window how everything's boarded up, everything's shut down.
[02:36:35.608 --> 02:36:39.310]  It used to be great over there at that very crossing just ten years ago.
[02:36:39.310 --> 02:36:42.111]  But this is the wonders of the failed state we're supposed to become.
[02:36:42.111 --> 02:36:43.611]  Then just come through and say, hi!
[02:36:43.611 --> 02:36:45.192]  Yeah, we're here from the...
[02:36:46.503 --> 02:36:46.943]  U.S.
[02:36:46.943 --> 02:36:49.825]  and they'll say, turn your camera off and go, well you got cameras.
[02:36:49.825 --> 02:36:51.466]  You know, I have full right to tape this.
[02:36:51.466 --> 02:36:54.627]  Say, listen, we want to show you a crime being committed.
[02:36:54.627 --> 02:36:57.809]  We want to show a file report on the illegal alien safe house.
[02:36:57.809 --> 02:36:58.929]  Can you pull us over here?
[02:36:58.929 --> 02:37:07.333]  Because you're going to get pulled over to citizens and searched as a default to see if you got drugs because you're not a cartel that's paid the cut.
[02:37:07.333 --> 02:37:10.715]  So the way to not get searched is to say you want to be searched.
[02:37:10.715 --> 02:37:14.517]  Then you'll be immediately released because that's the code word for, you know, you're part of the club.
[02:37:15.450 --> 02:37:17.332]  So, oh I'm giving out the secrets now.
[02:37:17.332 --> 02:37:25.419]  So, you can do it however you want, but I would just laugh at them and say, come on guys, I'm an American, you can see that.
[02:37:25.419 --> 02:37:28.422]  We're here to tell you about a crime that's been committed.
[02:37:28.422 --> 02:37:30.543]  The only way to do it is to come back through the border.
[02:37:30.543 --> 02:37:32.805]  That's the only way to talk to one face to face.
[02:37:32.805 --> 02:37:36.569]  Or you can drive around town and come up and knock on their windows or catch them walking out of stores.
[02:37:37.619 --> 02:37:38.939]  There are plenty of them around town.
[02:37:38.939 --> 02:37:42.941]  Even coming back to Austin, we're going to count a Border Patrol checkpoint.
[02:37:42.941 --> 02:37:45.922]  Oh, you're getting ready for college exams?
[02:37:45.922 --> 02:37:51.304]  Yeah, there's a huge facility down here that we could definitely do that operation on.
[02:37:51.304 --> 02:37:55.985]  Yeah, I would go in and say, we're here to report the safe houses.
[02:37:55.985 --> 02:37:58.186]  And they will literally just say, get out, get out of here.
[02:37:58.186 --> 02:38:00.107]  They don't want to know.
[02:38:00.107 --> 02:38:01.427]  Yeah, pretty much, yeah.
[02:38:01.427 --> 02:38:04.348]  Now, if you're college students coming back through, you're going to get your teeth knocked out.
[02:38:07.900 --> 02:38:12.861]  Or do they need help changing diapers or making sandwiches?
[02:38:12.861 --> 02:38:17.663]  You could ask them that and say, fine, we will help you change diapers.
[02:38:17.663 --> 02:38:19.903]  That would probably make them really happy, so then they don't have to do it.
[02:38:19.903 --> 02:38:22.764]  Alright guys, I've been ranting here.
[02:38:22.764 --> 02:38:25.224]  The big mother loads tonight, I know.
[02:38:25.224 --> 02:38:28.005]  How powerful is this ice whistleblower interview you guys have?
[02:38:29.298 --> 02:38:40.686]  Well, we talked to the guy, and I guess for fear of a reprisal, you know, possibly something along those lines, we didn't get as much dirt as we really were hoping to get, but he did help us out, so I definitely respect the guy for doing that much.
[02:38:40.686 --> 02:38:51.374]  Well, no, he gave you a lot about confirming the diseases are coming across, like TB, that's huge, confirming that they're just told to release them, and then he gave you tips in the investigation, so...
[02:38:51.894 --> 02:39:01.178]  You know, major breaking news with an ice whistle blower on the Texas border on diseases coming across and catch and release at night so the cameras don't catch it.
[02:39:01.178 --> 02:39:02.298]  That is sensational.
[02:39:02.298 --> 02:39:04.479]  You guys have done a great job.
[02:39:04.479 --> 02:39:06.119]  And then you just say up front his name.
[02:39:06.119 --> 02:39:07.660]  We've verified who he is.
[02:39:07.660 --> 02:39:08.480]  We did that last week.
[02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:09.741]  We got his ID.
[02:39:09.741 --> 02:39:15.063]  And then now you've come down and met him, verified who he is, and we're withholding his name to protect him from reprisals.
[02:39:15.063 --> 02:39:16.103]  That's it.
[02:39:16.103 --> 02:39:18.144]  Yeah.
[02:39:18.144 --> 02:39:18.824]  Anything else?
[02:39:18.824 --> 02:39:19.885]  Get all over that.
[02:39:19.885 --> 02:39:20.645]  Anything else, gentlemen?
[02:39:21.744 --> 02:39:24.505]  We're just looking forward to doing some more reports.
[02:39:24.505 --> 02:39:26.005]  John?
[02:39:26.005 --> 02:39:32.026]  Yeah, we'll follow your directives there, Alex, and there's no telling what's going to happen with them.
[02:39:32.026 --> 02:39:34.547]  Well, do whatever you come up with and what you want to do.
[02:39:34.547 --> 02:39:41.508]  It's just that I would try to go report the crimes and just show that the country's wide open.
[02:39:41.508 --> 02:39:44.989]  We need to illustrate that to the American people and to the people of Mexico.
[02:39:44.989 --> 02:39:46.629]  Now, if you really want to get hurt bad,
[02:39:47.679 --> 02:39:51.681]  Go to a Mexican hospital and ask for free health care.
[02:39:51.681 --> 02:39:53.822]  I don't recommend you do that.
[02:39:53.822 --> 02:39:54.562]  That's a good one.
[02:39:54.562 --> 02:39:58.403]  Or if you're illegal in Mexico, six months hard labor busting rocks.
[02:39:58.403 --> 02:40:02.325]  They have the toughest immigration in the entire hemisphere.
[02:40:02.325 --> 02:40:04.586]  Only North Korea and the other hemisphere.
[02:40:04.586 --> 02:40:06.227]  Come over here, you get everything handed to you.
[02:40:06.227 --> 02:40:08.988]  We go over there, we're sitting in jail busting rocks.
[02:40:08.988 --> 02:40:11.689]  Does that sound good to you?
[02:40:11.689 --> 02:40:14.070]  Oh yeah, that's I guess the system down there.
[02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:14.390]  Let's go!
[02:40:15.734 --> 02:40:20.096]  Well you guys do whatever, you've already done a great job and I know it's dangerous down there.
[02:40:20.096 --> 02:40:23.398]  So we'll just look for these reports on YouTube overnight.
[02:40:23.398 --> 02:40:27.040]  We'll look for them on the Nightly News tonight and tomorrow you'll be back with us.
[02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:29.321]  Now look, you can stay down there all week if you want.
[02:40:29.321 --> 02:40:31.902]  I think there's plenty of reporting for you guys to come back Friday.
[02:40:31.902 --> 02:40:35.244]  I know some of you have children, some of you got dogs you got to take care of.
[02:40:35.244 --> 02:40:36.745]  So when do you guys want to come back?
[02:40:38.007 --> 02:40:41.610]  Well, there are other groups we'd like to speak to.
[02:40:41.610 --> 02:40:45.793]  There's the sex trafficking industry that's been going on from Mexico.
[02:40:45.793 --> 02:40:51.938]  We'd like to speak to the people that represent that, to La Raza, to more ICE.
[02:40:51.938 --> 02:40:53.519]  We'd like to go to the headquarters of
[02:40:55.864 --> 02:40:59.245]  The Border Patrol facility that's up outside of McAllen.
[02:40:59.245 --> 02:40:59.685]  That's great!
[02:40:59.685 --> 02:41:03.666]  Why don't you go try to join La Raza, you and Jakar, you're not going to be allowed in.
[02:41:03.666 --> 02:41:05.607]  Because you're not in the right race.
[02:41:05.607 --> 02:41:08.647]  And then just point out, would the Klan be okay?
[02:41:08.647 --> 02:41:11.268]  And then just talk to La Raza, yeah.
[02:41:11.268 --> 02:41:16.769]  Well, and tonight Alex, we're going to actually speak to the illegals when they start letting them out.
[02:41:16.769 --> 02:41:19.590]  So, that's going to be, there's no telling what we'll get from that.
[02:41:22.276 --> 02:41:23.397]  Yeah, so we'll look into that.
[02:41:23.397 --> 02:41:26.299]  I've got to check with the guys to see what their schedules are, but we'll see what we can do.
[02:41:26.299 --> 02:41:31.123]  We'll at least file some more reports tonight and be available for the show tomorrow.
[02:41:31.123 --> 02:41:35.967]  Alright, great job Jakari Jackson and John Bowne down there on the Texas border.
[02:41:35.967 --> 02:41:39.290]  And next we can say to the California border or the Arizona border.
[02:41:39.290 --> 02:41:41.271]  That's where it really gets fun.
[02:41:41.271 --> 02:41:41.912]  Good job guys.
[02:41:42.688 --> 02:41:43.389]  All right, thanks Alex.
[02:41:43.389 --> 02:41:47.192]  All right, let's go back to the callers who've been patiently holding.
[02:41:47.192 --> 02:41:51.475]  But don't forget the White House is honoring illegal immigrants.
[02:41:51.475 --> 02:41:55.338]  That's the headline from The Hill.
[02:41:55.338 --> 02:42:00.863]  That's the mainstream newspaper that reports on the House that is nonpartisan.
[02:42:00.863 --> 02:42:04.306]  White House to honor young illegal immigrants.
[02:42:04.306 --> 02:42:06.728]  You heard that right.
[02:42:06.728 --> 02:42:08.089]  This is the vanguard.
[02:42:08.089 --> 02:42:09.350]  This is the takeover.
[02:42:09.350 --> 02:42:10.511]  This is the end.
[02:42:12.773 --> 02:42:15.395]  They already got California, they got another 5% in Texas.
[02:42:15.395 --> 02:42:18.137]  It goes blue.
[02:42:18.137 --> 02:42:19.418]  Sayonara, baby.
[02:42:19.418 --> 02:42:21.259]  They will vote to take their guns.
[02:42:21.259 --> 02:42:24.301]  The armored SWAT teams will be directed to start the SWAT team raids.
[02:42:24.301 --> 02:42:27.263]  Civil War starts.
[02:42:27.263 --> 02:42:33.547]  It'll be CNN, it'll be reporting, just like they're reporting Al-Qaeda's good, and the president of
[02:42:34.884 --> 02:42:35.664]  Iraq is bad.
[02:42:35.664 --> 02:42:37.685]  They will be reporting the patriots for bad.
[02:42:37.685 --> 02:42:41.147]  And the illegal alien armies along with the Democrats will be good.
[02:42:41.147 --> 02:42:42.547]  And they'll probably start killing Christians.
[02:42:42.547 --> 02:42:43.348]  I mean, who knows?
[02:42:43.348 --> 02:42:45.509]  I mean, everywhere they get control, they do.
[02:42:45.509 --> 02:42:47.249]  I mean, that's down the road a decade or so.
[02:42:47.249 --> 02:42:48.550]  But they're not going to stop, folks.
[02:42:48.550 --> 02:42:49.770]  They take down countries.
[02:42:49.770 --> 02:42:50.631]  They know what they're doing.
[02:42:50.631 --> 02:42:51.171]  They're savage.
[02:42:51.171 --> 02:42:52.732]  They're hardcore.
[02:42:52.732 --> 02:42:54.632]  Republican leadership's with them.
[02:42:54.632 --> 02:42:55.433]  It's all a big party.
[02:42:56.826 --> 02:42:59.449]  Some of the articles up on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:42:59.449 --> 02:43:01.011]  It's really a hot news day.
[02:43:01.011 --> 02:43:03.674]  DARPA brain chips to implant false memories.
[02:43:03.674 --> 02:43:06.457]  It's official for you and your family.
[02:43:06.457 --> 02:43:06.858]  Poll.
[02:43:06.858 --> 02:43:10.983]  Majority of Americans object to engaging in fresh Iraq conflict.
[02:43:13.459 --> 02:43:17.802]  Border Patrol investigates reporters, but not flood of illegals.
[02:43:17.802 --> 02:43:20.003]  Well, they investigate enemy Americans.
[02:43:20.003 --> 02:43:20.443]  U.S.
[02:43:20.443 --> 02:43:24.186]  ignored ISIS threat to hype endless war on terror.
[02:43:24.186 --> 02:43:25.507]  Well, look at the world in that daily headline.
[02:43:25.507 --> 02:43:26.607]  It's confirmed they armed them.
[02:43:26.607 --> 02:43:32.691]  I mean, it's establishment church groups aiding illegal immigrant invasion of U.S.
[02:43:32.691 --> 02:43:35.213]  That's confirmed.
[02:43:35.213 --> 02:43:36.814]  In their own words, by the way.
[02:43:36.814 --> 02:43:41.477]  Largest gas pipeline serving Europe through Ukraine blows up to cut off Russian money.
[02:43:42.594 --> 02:43:46.966]  Who cares if it increases gas prices for the people of Europe?
[02:43:46.966 --> 02:43:49.472]  And we haven't even gotten to the cop punching the woman in the stomach!
[02:43:51.181 --> 02:43:56.744]  A Pittsburgh woman suffered a beating from a police officer and the scene was caught on video.
[02:43:56.744 --> 02:43:57.944]  Yeah, for no reason.
[02:43:57.944 --> 02:44:00.746]  Why not just execute her?
[02:44:00.746 --> 02:44:02.187]  She is a citizen.
[02:44:02.187 --> 02:44:04.088]  She is dog garbage.
[02:44:04.088 --> 02:44:06.089]  She is droppings on the ground.
[02:44:06.089 --> 02:44:07.049]  You're a citizen?
[02:44:07.049 --> 02:44:08.650]  They see you as one thing.
[02:44:08.650 --> 02:44:09.770]  Chump sucker.
[02:44:09.770 --> 02:44:16.494]  To have your pension funds, your 401Ks, your rights, everything will be drained.
[02:44:16.494 --> 02:44:18.575]  Your women will be beaten.
[02:44:18.575 --> 02:44:20.336]  Everything you've got will be taken.
[02:44:20.976 --> 02:44:22.797]  Men will beat up your women.
[02:44:22.797 --> 02:44:23.858]  Uniformed men.
[02:44:23.858 --> 02:44:25.720]  Nothing will, everything will be taken.
[02:44:25.720 --> 02:44:29.803]  Because you will put up with it, then the maximum will be dumped out on your head.
[02:44:29.803 --> 02:44:31.504]  Because you want it, you got it.
[02:44:31.504 --> 02:44:44.393]  Now before I go any further, I really cannot describe to you how life-changing the Survival Shield X2 has been for me.
[02:44:44.393 --> 02:44:48.977]  It was already amazing, ladies and gentlemen, to
[02:44:53.058 --> 02:44:53.258]  Yeah.
[02:45:14.161 --> 02:45:19.246]  You can see in the video we're playing of your TV viewer, the light blue of the old Survival Shield, which still sells great for kids.
[02:45:19.246 --> 02:45:21.308]  Check with your physician before you do.
[02:45:21.308 --> 02:45:32.238]  And then in a time test, it turns electric violet purple, and then total dark purple from the Survival Shield X2, the strongest nascent iodine out there.
[02:45:32.238 --> 02:45:34.741]  And it is simply amazing from 7 to 12,000 feet.
[02:45:37.401 --> 02:45:39.662]  That's the levels of the drilled mind that has it.
[02:45:39.662 --> 02:45:46.326]  And then we have the actual factory video up at Infowarslife.com with the still images at Infowarslife.com.
[02:45:46.326 --> 02:45:53.610]  We'll take you to the shopping cart and show you where you can see the videos and everything there and read about the science of what this does in your body.
[02:45:53.610 --> 02:45:55.651]  Bioavailability.
[02:45:55.651 --> 02:45:58.073]  Regular iodine, the government used to recommend was in salt.
[02:46:00.094 --> 02:46:01.115]  Because they didn't care about people.
[02:46:01.115 --> 02:46:05.898]  There was massive brain damage and mental problems and goiter and everything else until they recommended it.
[02:46:05.898 --> 02:46:09.220]  Then for some reason they pulled it back out and put the bad stuff in the food chain.
[02:46:09.220 --> 02:46:10.381]  The bad halogens.
[02:46:10.381 --> 02:46:14.424]  The good halogen, ladies and gentlemen, this is the pure good halogen.
[02:46:14.424 --> 02:46:14.884]  Iodine.
[02:46:14.884 --> 02:46:16.986]  And it just supercharges everything in my body.
[02:46:16.986 --> 02:46:18.747]  I mean, you've heard what it does.
[02:46:18.747 --> 02:46:19.928]  This is the next level.
[02:46:19.928 --> 02:46:22.049]  Now I'll warn you.
[02:46:22.049 --> 02:46:22.749]  I will warn you.
[02:46:23.703 --> 02:46:35.348]  The first weaker form that we had of this that was still proprietary and nobody else had made me have that toxic effect, I forget the exact name of it, where you detox in 15 to 20 days and you feel bad for about a week.
[02:46:35.348 --> 02:46:39.150]  So check with your physician or healthcare provider, just be informed before.
[02:46:39.150 --> 02:46:47.794]  The new stuff is, you know, once you've been accustomed and if you so choose, or you want to take a lighter dose, okay?
[02:46:47.794 --> 02:46:50.755]  Me personally, I just cannot describe to you
[02:46:52.529 --> 02:46:58.914]  How evil the globalist are that they have taken this out of the food chain while the elite are obsessed with iodine.
[02:46:58.914 --> 02:47:07.701]  And this is the one thing that even the establishment tends to leave folks alone about because they know themselves, people that promote this, they know themselves it's important.
[02:47:07.701 --> 02:47:09.683]  I mean, they know this is it.
[02:47:09.683 --> 02:47:11.584]  The pineal gland, the thyroid.
[02:47:11.584 --> 02:47:21.993]  I mean, from what I've talked to Dr. Gripp and others about, this just goes out, it's so active, so chemically active, it just goes out and just strips the garbage out.
[02:47:25.253 --> 02:47:28.555]  And what it's done for me in the middle of clarity and everything else is simply amazing.
[02:47:28.555 --> 02:47:29.716]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:47:29.716 --> 02:47:31.397]  I want to thank you all that have gotten it.
[02:47:31.397 --> 02:47:33.979]  You're helping fund the operation at the same time it's a win-win.
[02:47:33.979 --> 02:47:36.101]  You're helping promote liberty.
[02:47:36.101 --> 02:47:39.764]  And we've got 2,000 bottles of the Lung Cleanse.
[02:47:39.764 --> 02:47:44.627]  And it's so hard to get the, I don't know, it's like 20-something essential oils and herbs and there are more.
[02:47:44.627 --> 02:47:46.488]  And it's all organic and it's so hard to get.
[02:47:46.488 --> 02:47:49.491]  I'm trying to get a group to take a few ingredients out because I can't get enough of this.
[02:47:50.234 --> 02:47:51.855]  And the lung cleanse is amazing.

[02:48:34.776 --> 02:48:35.437]  I believe in that.
[02:48:35.437 --> 02:48:37.958]  You reap what you sow, and it's happening.
[02:48:37.958 --> 02:48:39.459]  And so, thank you all for your support.
[02:48:39.459 --> 02:48:41.940]  Thank you for being PrisonPlanet.tv members as well.
[02:48:41.940 --> 02:48:43.260]  Alright, let's go to the calls.
[02:48:43.260 --> 02:48:45.742]  Kevin?
[02:48:45.742 --> 02:48:46.062]  Mary?
[02:48:47.608 --> 02:48:49.810]  Chris, Dave, Scott, we'll get to all of you.
[02:48:49.810 --> 02:48:53.192]  Thank you for holding during that report from the border.
[02:48:53.192 --> 02:48:54.253]  Let's talk to Kevin.
[02:48:54.253 --> 02:48:54.833]  You're on the air.
[02:48:54.833 --> 02:48:56.474]  Thanks for calling.
[02:48:56.474 --> 02:48:58.736]  Hey Alex, I got two views.
[02:48:58.736 --> 02:49:00.337]  I'd love to hear your feedback.
[02:49:00.337 --> 02:49:04.480]  I'm just on my lunch break here, so I'll be quick.
[02:49:04.480 --> 02:49:15.828]  The first one is, if you used to ask people outside of America what they thought of Americans, they used to tell you that, I like Americans, but I just don't like their government.
[02:49:15.828 --> 02:49:17.209]  That's starting to change now.
[02:49:17.748 --> 02:49:25.059]  Where people are no longer saying that, giving them that sort of leeway, where now people are actually wanting to hold Americans' feet to the fire.
[02:49:25.998 --> 02:49:28.839]  I mean, it's quite interesting that... Oh, no, I agree.
[02:49:28.839 --> 02:49:31.320]  I get mad by some slack-jawed yuppie.
[02:49:31.320 --> 02:49:33.761]  This happens about once a week when I'm in a restaurant or something.
[02:49:33.761 --> 02:49:37.262]  They'll walk over, because this is what liberals do, fake liberals.
[02:49:37.262 --> 02:49:38.803]  They'll go, uh-huh, you're a coot.
[02:49:38.803 --> 02:49:40.223]  Nobody likes you.
[02:49:40.223 --> 02:49:42.544]  And I say, listen, I know you're in groupthink.
[02:49:42.544 --> 02:49:43.584]  I know everything about you.
[02:49:43.584 --> 02:49:44.785]  I know your profile.
[02:49:44.785 --> 02:49:46.505]  You're a pathetic slave.
[02:49:46.505 --> 02:49:47.846]  This is a private establishment.
[02:49:47.846 --> 02:49:50.707]  Get your ass away from my table before I have you thrown out of here.
[02:49:51.855 --> 02:49:54.497]  I'm a Canadian, I like to straight shoot.
[02:49:54.497 --> 02:49:58.360]  The other one I'd like to get your feedback on is sort of a metaphor.
[02:49:58.360 --> 02:49:59.781]  I sort of see this population as ants in an ant farm.
[02:49:59.781 --> 02:50:02.963]  And even if we all got together and we all worked for unity,
[02:50:18.860 --> 02:50:23.664]  We still have the farmer who's outside that ant farm who's in total control.
[02:50:23.664 --> 02:50:32.012]  We can have nice cars, nice homes, even have nice relationships, but when it really comes down to it, that farmer is in total control.
[02:50:32.012 --> 02:50:35.655]  And that's what top globalist, Nobel Prize winner,
[02:50:36.978 --> 02:50:38.059]  His name will pop in my head.
[02:50:38.059 --> 02:50:53.065]  Bertrand Russell said in three different books, he said, our scientific dictatorship will so control the environment with an artificial reality when we're dying, that rebelling against our technocracy will be like sheep rebelling against the practice of eating mutton, which is adult sheep.
[02:50:53.065 --> 02:50:56.707]  So, absolutely, devastatingly well said, Kevin.
[02:50:56.707 --> 02:50:59.048]  Yeah, people that serve this system are just idiots.
[02:51:00.017 --> 02:51:05.041]  Our founders pledged their lives, fortunes, and sacred honor to fight tyranny, and it's time to fight again.
[02:51:05.041 --> 02:51:08.624]  I'm Tisha Cassada, and I'm running as an independent for Congress in Colorado.
[02:51:08.624 --> 02:51:13.467]  I fight to end the military police state, ban GMO toxic foods, and abolish legal tender laws.
[02:51:13.467 --> 02:51:16.870]  Consider donating some of your hard-earned fiat currency to help me fight.
[02:51:16.870 --> 02:51:20.213]  Donate $25 or more and you'll receive a gift to awaken others.
[02:51:20.213 --> 02:51:21.954]  I need and appreciate your support.
[02:51:21.954 --> 02:51:23.175]  Please donate at Cassada2014.com.

[02:51:54.874 --> 02:51:56.415]  Stop Big Brother in his tracks.
[02:52:00.521 --> 02:52:01.883]  In the near future.
[02:52:01.883 --> 02:52:06.370]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:52:06.370 --> 02:52:07.592]  Security alert.
[02:52:07.592 --> 02:52:09.615]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:52:09.615 --> 02:52:13.200]  Analysis, InfoWars, building, independent media operation.
[02:52:13.200 --> 02:52:15.904]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we
[02:52:16.084 --> 02:52:18.167]  We are the ones responsible.
[02:52:18.167 --> 02:52:20.750]  Crime Directive discrediting Alex Jones.
[02:52:20.750 --> 02:52:23.614]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:52:23.614 --> 02:52:26.858]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:52:26.858 --> 02:52:29.161]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:52:29.161 --> 02:52:30.703]  These people are assaulting us!
[02:52:30.703 --> 02:52:32.986]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:52:33.526 --> 02:52:35.468]  They are never going to stop.
[02:52:35.468 --> 02:52:43.136]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:52:43.136 --> 02:52:54.046]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:52:54.046 --> 02:52:55.548]  Collectually, it's begun.
[02:52:55.548 --> 02:52:56.269]  You can feel it.
[02:52:59.162 --> 02:53:03.445]  A 30-day GMO-free emergency food supply for only $99?

[02:53:21.577 --> 02:53:23.379]  Of any artificial flavors and colorings.
[02:53:23.379 --> 02:53:27.903]  Have a 20-year shelf life and take up to 70% less space than number 10 cans.
[02:53:27.903 --> 02:53:30.105]  They even offer a gluten-free option.
[02:53:30.105 --> 02:53:33.068]  Oregon Trail Foods and 30dayfoodsupply.com.
[02:53:33.068 --> 02:53:37.933]  Keep prices low by buying directly from the producers in Oregon and then passing the savings to you.

[02:53:45.800 --> 02:53:46.641]  Visit the website.
[02:53:46.741 --> 02:53:50.163]  By the way, folks, folks are always trying to hack InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:54:13.979 --> 02:54:16.760]  It's been in the news before, some of the things that have gone on.
[02:54:16.760 --> 02:54:21.622]  It's been big enough where it's showed up in newspapers.
[02:54:21.622 --> 02:54:26.645]  In indictments of establishment people and other things.
[02:54:26.645 --> 02:54:35.629]  GCN up in Minnesota has had devices hitting their connections to the satellite and everything else and going after a bunch of other systems.
[02:54:36.752 --> 02:54:47.401]  They don't even know that outside of these offices and outside of Minnesota, there's multiple other systems just sitting there, like we're idiots, under other names, you name it.
[02:54:47.401 --> 02:54:58.150]  I want to just tell the Pentagon and the criminals that work at the top of it and all of that, that that's what Cyber Command is about, is attacking the alternative real media in this country and taking us down.
[02:54:58.150 --> 02:54:58.671]  They admit that.
[02:54:59.850 --> 02:55:02.111]  And we've been attacked by NORTHCOM computers.
[02:55:02.111 --> 02:55:05.113]  I mean, they don't even hire, but they direct this stuff.
[02:55:05.113 --> 02:55:06.334]  NSA stuff.
[02:55:06.334 --> 02:55:12.178]  After our reporters went to the NSA, they took over our cell phones, took over a bunch of computers, messed with stuff.
[02:55:12.178 --> 02:55:13.338]  And we just love it!
[02:55:13.338 --> 02:55:17.841]  I mean, that only makes us better to add more redundancy and stuff.
[02:55:17.841 --> 02:55:19.342]  I mean, we're here to defend the Republic.
[02:55:19.342 --> 02:55:21.323]  We know we're in a war.
[02:55:21.323 --> 02:55:25.026]  We don't just fall down on the ground in a fetal position when something happens.
[02:55:26.219 --> 02:55:29.220]  But we've stayed up and on the air.
[02:55:29.220 --> 02:55:32.581]  But that's the type of stuff that's going on where it's not like computer stuff.
[02:55:32.581 --> 02:55:41.523]  It's not like it's like Stuxnet where they're coming in trying to block hardwired stuff and using it as a practice to take the country down.
[02:55:41.523 --> 02:55:44.364]  Let's talk to Mary in Washington.
[02:55:44.364 --> 02:55:45.384]  Mary, you're on the air.
[02:55:45.384 --> 02:55:45.724]  Go ahead.
[02:55:47.031 --> 02:55:48.752]  Yes, hi Alex.
[02:55:48.752 --> 02:55:56.735]  I was watching your special report, Proof We Run Al-Qaeda, which is June 14th on YouTube, anyway.
[02:55:56.735 --> 02:56:07.660]  And I made the observation that some of these, you know, Al-Qaeda redux ISIS characters look all really beefy, like American football players.
[02:56:07.660 --> 02:56:15.944]  And then I wondered, why would the Saudi princes, the secular Saudi princes, those, you know, leches and womanizers and so on,
[02:56:16.224 --> 02:56:27.300]  Why would they try and rely on Al-Qaeda or ISIS, so that would be like herding cats, when they could simply hire Blackwater security mercenaries, or whatever they're calling themselves.
[02:56:27.300 --> 02:56:32.627]  Because Blackwater would work directly through a contract, not through Saudi Arabia.
[02:56:33.508 --> 02:56:37.329]  And you probably couldn't get Blackwater to go around and actually overthrow Iraq again.
[02:56:37.329 --> 02:56:38.709]  They're not even that immoral.
[02:56:38.709 --> 02:56:43.450]  The average Special Forces person that's in that halfway has to sign on to what they're doing.
[02:56:43.450 --> 02:56:48.572]  So they always use Saudi Arabia since 1901 to take over the countries there.
[02:56:48.572 --> 02:56:52.073]  So they're using the big army they have that they just used against Syria.
[02:56:52.073 --> 02:56:53.773]  That's why they're using that group.
[02:56:56.791 --> 02:57:04.417]  I was thinking that anyone could be behind a ski mask, but you know, we had an agreement with Saudi Arabia that we protect them militarily.
[02:57:04.417 --> 02:57:11.762]  So Saudi Arabia might have just gotten tired of waiting for us, you know, and just picked up the ball and gone with it.
[02:57:11.762 --> 02:57:15.925]  They might have developed an army sufficient enough to do whatever it is they want to do.
[02:57:15.925 --> 02:57:17.907]  Sure, Mary, I appreciate your call.
[02:57:17.907 --> 02:57:20.709]  Listen, we know what went on.
[02:57:20.709 --> 02:57:21.650]  I mean, this is not hidden.
[02:57:22.861 --> 02:57:29.024]  That they trained these military at bases in Jordan, in Syria, in controlled areas in Western Iraq.
[02:57:29.024 --> 02:57:31.446]  That's mainstream news now.
[02:57:31.446 --> 02:57:35.828]  So this was set up to destabilize the whole region for Saudi Arabia.
[02:57:35.828 --> 02:57:36.608]  Bottom line.
[02:57:36.608 --> 02:57:38.769]  By the way, we just got a contact from Fort Hood.
[02:57:38.769 --> 02:57:41.671]  We'll give you a document cam shot of this.
[02:57:41.671 --> 02:57:48.715]  Infowars.com, per the Texas Military Force Acceptable Use Policy,
[02:57:50.792 --> 02:57:56.518]  And so this is out of the Texas Guard, I guess, out at Camp Mabry, and we got this contact through Fort Hood.
[02:57:56.518 --> 02:57:57.499]  Your IP address, 5590-53.46.
[02:58:01.172 --> 02:58:06.755]  URL Infowars.com, category of this URL, violence, hate, racism.
[02:58:06.755 --> 02:58:12.577]  And I told you, they have gambling, they have porn, they have hacking, they have the category of violence, hate, racism.
[02:58:12.577 --> 02:58:13.658]  That's Obama talk.
[02:58:13.658 --> 02:58:16.019]  We're banned on military basis.
[02:58:16.019 --> 02:58:18.380]  So, they did this a long time ago and it backfired.
[02:58:18.380 --> 02:58:22.822]  Everyone in the military, it is your duty for the First Amendment, even if you don't believe in what we're saying.
[02:58:23.682 --> 02:58:25.463]  Which we know most of you do, you're patriots.
[02:58:25.463 --> 02:58:28.145]  Tell friends and family about InfoWars.com.
[02:58:28.145 --> 02:58:30.987]  Tell folks about OffBase, my films, YouTube.
[02:58:30.987 --> 02:58:41.994]  This is Chinese-style net censorship, so the military doesn't find out, like last time, that our government's running Al-Qaeda, so you don't start that campaign again to say, I will not fight for Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
[02:58:44.095 --> 02:58:46.598]  Quite frankly, Farid Zarqari endorsed Al Qaeda today.
[02:58:46.598 --> 02:58:47.919]  I want to blow him up!
[02:58:47.919 --> 02:58:49.400]  I want to bomb him!
[02:58:49.400 --> 02:58:50.141]  I hate him!
[02:58:50.141 --> 02:58:52.163]  We'll be right back in Overdrive!
[02:58:52.163 --> 02:59:07.377]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:59:07.737 --> 02:59:12.338]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[02:59:12.338 --> 02:59:22.960]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:59:22.960 --> 02:59:29.461]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:59:29.461 --> 02:59:32.021]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:59:32.021 --> 02:59:35.642]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[02:59:35.842 --> 02:59:37.784]  It's not just the Super Mel Vitality.
[02:59:37.784 --> 02:59:41.947]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.
[02:59:41.947 --> 02:59:48.912]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[03:00:05.894 --> 03:00:07.215]  Big Brother.
[03:00:07.215 --> 03:00:08.977]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:08.977 --> 03:00:10.738]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:10.738 --> 03:00:12.320]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.320 --> 03:00:13.861]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.861 --> 03:00:18.065]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.065 --> 03:00:22.109]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:24.093 --> 03:00:29.217]  If you're in the military and they're not letting you get on InfoWars.com, try PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:00:29.217 --> 03:00:30.338]  Bureaucracy's so stupid.
[03:00:30.338 --> 03:00:31.338]  A lot of times they don't block that.
[03:00:31.338 --> 03:00:32.719]  They will now.
[03:00:32.719 --> 03:00:36.562]  You can get us on Facebook, Twitter, other enemy platforms, YouTube.
[03:00:36.562 --> 03:00:38.183]  We have our own PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:00:38.183 --> 03:00:41.025]  That's why we have it.
[03:00:41.025 --> 03:00:45.388]  So that it's not as easy for the system to just block us on YouTube as they've done before.
[03:00:45.388 --> 03:00:47.070]  That's why you gotta become a member.
[03:00:47.070 --> 03:00:49.191]  And don't just take this broadcast for granted, folks.
[03:00:49.191 --> 03:00:51.092]  They do not want this going out.
[03:00:51.092 --> 03:00:52.433]  Chris in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:00:52.433 --> 03:00:53.034]  Thanks for holding.
[03:00:56.374 --> 03:00:56.934]  Yep.
[03:00:56.934 --> 03:00:57.835]  You want to talk, Chris?
[03:00:57.835 --> 03:00:59.676]  Are you there?
[03:00:59.676 --> 03:01:00.137]  Yes.
[03:01:00.137 --> 03:01:21.331]  In reference to the caller who said, don't feed the beast, yes, we can follow the good example of tax protester Cindy Sheehan, especially in view of the article, like Billions Over Baghdad 2007 Vanity Fair, where out of $12 billion from the Fed that was sent to buy off the Iraqi Coalition Provisional Authority, $9 billion went missing.
[03:01:21.331 --> 03:01:23.653]  I'm sure you've seen the picture of the pallets of cash.
[03:01:24.253 --> 03:01:25.674]  Yeah, that was just the first rollout.
[03:01:25.674 --> 03:01:27.555]  It's as high as $80 billion.
[03:01:27.555 --> 03:01:33.838]  And they even gave privates up to $30 grand to corrupt them and threaten to arrest them later so the military couldn't speak out.
[03:01:35.441 --> 03:01:43.230]  Right, right, and they've got to pay off the profit tyrants, both within and without our country, for any hope of future control over them.
[03:01:43.230 --> 03:01:55.423]  So let's stop working for a privately owned, unaccountable central bank controlling all our currency and credit, which can only be spent at venues which accept it, all our company stores and our fascist company...
[03:01:56.224 --> 03:02:04.730]  Go to the Amish, go to the farmers market, plant your own garden, get out of the system, get off the grid as much as you can, eat healthy, be loving to each other, speak out against the globalists, well said.
[03:02:24.764 --> 03:02:28.130]  That's how you bring them down is exposing their operations.
[03:02:28.130 --> 03:02:30.534]  And it didn't matter if the zombies want to go along with it.
[03:02:30.534 --> 03:02:32.778]  A large minority can stop this.
[03:02:32.778 --> 03:02:34.361]  Dave in California, you're on the air.
[03:02:34.361 --> 03:02:34.701]  Go ahead.
[03:02:35.677 --> 03:02:53.153]  Hey Alex, I was just calling to let you know that with the ISIS thing going on, there is a Fort Hunter Liggett in Camp Roberts here in California, and the bases are packed, and the military officers are staying there training for Iraq.
[03:02:53.153 --> 03:02:54.535]  That's what they're doing right now over there.
[03:02:56.212 --> 03:03:00.897]  Yeah, and then they'll give part of the country to the Al-Qaeda folks, saying it was a deal with them.
[03:03:00.897 --> 03:03:05.502]  Partition the nation, call the other part Kurd, and the other part Shiite, break it in three pieces.
[03:03:05.502 --> 03:03:08.305]  Always been the plan, and they're now promoting that right now.
[03:03:08.305 --> 03:03:09.166]  Totally disgusting.
[03:03:09.166 --> 03:03:10.728]  Anything else?
[03:03:10.728 --> 03:03:12.109]  No, that's it, man.
[03:03:12.109 --> 03:03:12.690]  Keep it up, brother.
[03:03:14.124 --> 03:03:15.325]  Go ahead.
[03:03:15.325 --> 03:03:15.865]  Thank you.
[03:03:15.865 --> 03:03:18.366]  And bottom line, we are being blocked at more bases.
[03:03:18.366 --> 03:03:23.928]  If you're at a base or a library or anywhere being blocked, send it to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[03:03:23.928 --> 03:03:26.849]  We'll get an article out about where this is happening to you.
[03:03:26.849 --> 03:03:32.952]  But this is out of Fort Hood, and I guess they might have been looking at a Texas Guard portal when they got blocked.
[03:03:32.952 --> 03:03:37.173]  But that's a Texas Guard report saying not allowed to go to that.
[03:03:37.173 --> 03:03:41.995]  I guess because we showed them running checkpoints and stuff for the kite festival and how they're being federalized.
[03:03:41.995 --> 03:03:42.896]  I guess that's a big no-no.
[03:03:44.226 --> 03:03:46.155]  Let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Michigan.
[03:03:46.155 --> 03:03:47.381]  You're on the air, thanks for calling.
[03:03:48.257 --> 03:03:48.818]  Hello, Alex.
[03:03:48.818 --> 03:03:55.262]  Yeah, I'm just calling about how they're really throwing it in your face with the water foreignization here in town.
[03:03:55.262 --> 03:04:06.731]  You can go to www.cityofmesquiganheights.org and view the report for this year, how they're finally admitting that the fluoride comes from discharge from fertilizer and aluminum factories.
[03:04:06.731 --> 03:04:10.554]  The barium comes from drilling waste discharge, metal refinery discharge.
[03:04:10.554 --> 03:04:13.496]  The chromium comes from steel and pulp mill discharge.
[03:04:13.496 --> 03:04:16.078]  And by the way, the general public doesn't know that.
[03:04:16.718 --> 03:04:25.585]  But you should send us at ShowTipsAndInfoWars.com that link just to show, headline, City Admits Toxic Waste Added To Water.
[03:04:25.585 --> 03:04:26.286]  On purpose.
[03:04:26.286 --> 03:04:31.230]  And then point out that worldwide they take the toxic waste as a big joke and put it in the water.
[03:04:31.230 --> 03:04:36.114]  Promise you'll send me the link to that city and that town with them admitting that to ShowTipsAndInfoWars.com.
[03:04:36.114 --> 03:04:37.235]  Will you do it?
[03:04:37.235 --> 03:04:37.635]  Yep.
[03:04:37.635 --> 03:04:37.875]  Yep.
[03:04:37.875 --> 03:04:38.696]  Will do, Alex.
[03:04:38.696 --> 03:04:39.657]  Say the name of the city again?
[03:04:40.697 --> 03:04:43.598]  CityofMuskegonHeights.org.
[03:04:43.598 --> 03:04:44.519]  All one word.
[03:04:44.519 --> 03:04:46.100]  www.cityofmuskegonheights.org.
[03:04:46.100 --> 03:04:48.381]  And what's the name of the document?
[03:04:48.381 --> 03:04:52.723]  It's the Water... Muskegon Heights Water System Water Quality Report 2014.
[03:04:52.723 --> 03:04:55.144]  And by the way, all of it says it.
[03:04:55.144 --> 03:04:56.845]  Up to 350 deadly chemicals.
