[00:19.080 --> 00:43.240]  Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen it is Monday the 27th day of August 2012

[00:48.200 --> 00:54.080]  hours and joining us we have Joseph Farah of WorldNet Daily he's got a lot
[00:54.080 --> 00:58.040]  of sources in Virginia that's where WorldNet Daily's based and he's basically
[00:58.040 --> 01:02.760]  saying the green light is on right now for an Iran attack now the green light
[01:02.760 --> 01:08.440]  has been on several times before but more and more it looks like it's headed
[01:08.440 --> 01:12.640]  in that direction could it be the October surprise Joseph Farah will be
[01:12.640 --> 01:16.640]  joining us and we'll take calls for the second half of them joining us or you
[01:16.640 --> 01:21.560]  can keel hold me Michael Murphy tried to come on last week but his cell phone
[01:21.560 --> 01:24.960]  hotel phone sounded terrible so I got rid of them in about 20 minutes but very
[01:24.960 --> 01:29.320]  informative the latest on aerosol spring chemtrails weather manipulation will

[01:40.400 --> 01:46.360]  all of it but one of the big issues that I'm going to be discussing with
[01:46.360 --> 01:51.000]  Joseph Farah is the incredible admissions by the London Telegraph and
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.600]  other major papers of what we've known for a year and a half in Libya and about
[01:55.600 --> 02:04.200]  eight nine months in Syria US British Saudi Arabian special forces are inside
[02:04.200 --> 02:08.800]  Syria so when you heard on the news oh there's peaceful activist being attacked
[02:08.800 --> 02:13.960]  by the big old media sod and that there's wonderful fighters resisting now
[02:13.960 --> 02:18.200]  it is our criminal government in there trying to overthrow that country and
[02:18.200 --> 02:23.680]  there's more mainstream news admitting that it's al-Qaeda base the heart of the
[02:23.680 --> 02:28.960]  liberating loving sweet seas the you know the valiant freedom fighters are
[02:28.960 --> 02:35.440]  Al Ciaida that's why we call al-Qaeda Al Ciaida so we're talking about that with
[02:35.440 --> 02:41.280]  Joe Farah coming up today there's also a story that is finally starting to get
[02:41.280 --> 02:46.760]  legs and that's a good because it's very very serious
[02:46.760 --> 02:53.520]  Suzanne Pozel proposal writing for info wars.com integrates all the different
[02:53.520 --> 02:59.000]  reports coming out does a great job and the report is at info wars.com and
[02:59.000 --> 03:05.120]  prisonplanet.com I'm going to ask Kurt Nemo right now Susan's also the editor
[03:05.120 --> 03:08.880]  in chief over at Occupy Corporatism but the point is their article appearing at
[03:08.880 --> 03:18.000]  info wars.com US veterans forcibly sequestered in mental hospitals is
[03:18.000 --> 03:22.920]  indefinite detention yes that's what it is they use the mental health laws to
[03:22.920 --> 03:26.240]  indefinitely detain you going back about a hundred years ago right at about a
[03:26.240 --> 03:31.160]  hundred years ago 1910 or so all over the United States 35 states passed laws
[03:31.160 --> 03:36.280]  by the 20s but it started in 1910 where they would have mental health come
[03:36.280 --> 03:40.680]  grab you for racial hygiene health that's where Hitler got the term was from
[03:40.680 --> 03:46.360]  the United States in England and they would sterilize you for a B minus black
[03:46.360 --> 03:53.360]  white they didn't care they would sterilize you for a B minus sterilize
[03:53.360 --> 03:59.560]  you for a B minus and of course the eugenics based game has never been to

[07:16.460 --> 07:20.000]  ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to
[07:20.000 --> 07:24.080]  counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own

[08:48.040 --> 08:53.640]  launched that will track you 24 7 also there's a report about scientists able
[08:53.640 --> 08:59.440]  to hack the brain now with a computer and retrieve personal data food
[08:59.440 --> 09:05.480]  shortage could force world into vegetarianism warrants scientist that's
[09:05.480 --> 09:09.480]  always been their plan total social engineering scientist again as I
[09:09.480 --> 09:13.920]  mentioned successfully hack into brain to obtain private data that's out of
[09:13.920 --> 09:19.400]  CBS Seattle we're going to be going over that researchers find mysterious new
[09:19.400 --> 09:23.920]  AIDS-like disease funny it's causing autoimmune diseases in rodents that are
[09:23.920 --> 09:29.120]  fed GMO products you can look that up just type in GMO linked to autoimmune
[09:29.120 --> 09:37.160]  disorder continuing we're going to be breaking all of this down today Portland
[09:37.160 --> 09:41.640]  Oregon to spend five million dollars to put in the equipment to poison its
[09:41.640 --> 09:46.960]  residents with toxic fluoride I know I keep harping on that because now it's
[09:46.960 --> 09:54.520]  even in the Harvard Medical Journal federal journals even the American
[09:54.520 --> 09:58.760]  Medical Association seven years ago was finally forced along the American
[09:58.760 --> 10:05.680]  Dental Association to say you shouldn't be drinking 1.5 or even one part per
[10:05.680 --> 10:12.520]  million sodium fluoride and they're now saying discontinue it as use as a
[10:12.520 --> 10:20.240]  pesticide on crops yeah you spray it on crops it it kills it kills bugs but
[10:20.240 --> 10:25.720]  still we've gone from about 65 percent of the United States same thing in
[10:25.720 --> 10:29.840]  Canada and England it's very similar numbers being fluoridated a decade ago
[10:29.840 --> 10:36.080]  to about 74 percent last number I saw earlier this year so they will come in
[10:36.080 --> 10:39.560]  and spend tens of millions of dollars like in the case of San Antonio a few
[10:39.560 --> 10:44.720]  years ago to brainwash people and the city council to finally accept it because
[10:44.720 --> 10:50.040]  they love you so much even though it gives you cancer and reduces your IQ
[10:50.040 --> 10:52.280]  and I'm about to get into all the other news and give the phone number out the
[10:52.280 --> 11:01.640]  point is last night I pulled into CVS on my way home and I walked up to the
[11:01.640 --> 11:07.560]  counter and I had some ballpoint pins and you know stuff like that that my
[11:07.560 --> 11:14.600]  children needed and I get up there to the counter and they always pick managers
[11:14.600 --> 11:19.320]  who are big guys I guess they're supposed to lord over people and he asked
[11:19.320 --> 11:24.680]  me how my day is going oh it's going fine and he goes I recognize that voice
[11:24.680 --> 11:29.000]  and there's nobody behind me in line at that time and I go yeah I'm the talk
[11:29.000 --> 11:35.720]  show host and he goes yeah you're the one that came in my store and videotape
[11:35.720 --> 11:41.440]  things in fact guys will you guys pull up Alex Jones and CVS exposes fluoride
[11:41.440 --> 11:44.660]  water for children I meant to have you do that it's it's everywhere or just
[11:44.660 --> 11:53.720]  fluoride in CVS will pull it up for you and I look at him and he's kind of
[11:53.720 --> 11:56.680]  looking at me like he's angry like I'm gonna you know get scared here like I'm
[11:56.680 --> 12:01.080]  some you know little employee back in the back corner he's gonna lord over and
[12:01.080 --> 12:08.360]  he goes yeah and I said well it's a public interest you know sodium fluoride
[12:08.360 --> 12:12.440]  that's added to that quote baby formula water that you have whenever you end cap
[12:12.440 --> 12:16.840]  even the American Medical Association says children under five shouldn't be
[12:16.840 --> 12:20.880]  drinking fluoride water under six actually he goes yeah I know I didn't
[12:20.880 --> 12:25.000]  believe you and I went and looked that up and found out it's true I found out
[12:25.000 --> 12:30.960]  we're phasing it out nationwide and I said why not because it's bad for people
[12:30.960 --> 12:36.760]  but because it's not selling and he said yeah you're right so now there's like
[12:36.760 --> 12:41.120]  four people behind because there's one person on a Sunday evening you know at
[12:41.120 --> 12:45.280]  the checkout counters there's four lanes of counters one guy four people have
[12:45.280 --> 12:48.800]  stacked up and some are smiling and looking at me you know who I am others
[12:48.800 --> 12:54.160]  looking at me like I'm crazy I mean whoa we've got an American who's willing to
[12:54.160 --> 12:59.800]  talk we've got an American who's willing to actually communicate with other
[12:59.800 --> 13:04.040]  humans we're supposed to stay quiet go get our fluoride water get our Prozac
[13:04.040 --> 13:09.040]  and go home and die we're not supposed to communicate and here's somebody in
[13:09.040 --> 13:11.720]  this keep your head down prison grill everybody's supposed to go home and
[13:11.720 --> 13:15.120]  watch television and watch their imaginary friends and have their
[13:15.120 --> 13:18.080]  imaginary relationships as you drive through the neighborhoods and the
[13:18.080 --> 13:22.400]  windows all glow blue as people watch television and don't talk to each other
[13:22.400 --> 13:29.360]  anymore as our culture dies I start going yeah there's poison in that water
[13:29.360 --> 13:33.680]  and now he's not acting all tough guy anymore kind of bowing up now he's
[13:33.680 --> 13:39.080]  shrinking back embarrassed everybody's listening and I'm like yeah I went in
[13:39.080 --> 13:45.760]  Walgreens too and showed their poison fluoride water and I said everybody needs
[13:45.760 --> 13:49.680]  to understand there's an agenda and it's a chemical weapon by then he's now
[13:49.680 --> 13:53.960]  shrunk down trying to literally hide behind the counter and everybody else
[13:53.960 --> 13:57.960]  looks scared and I go that's right you're scared of the man that talks I
[13:57.960 --> 14:02.520]  walk in there's a chemical weapon meant to brain damage babies and I dare say
[14:02.520 --> 14:08.120]  something and I dare make a video and as I walked out I said but I'm getting the
[14:08.120 --> 14:12.480]  results and that's what matters so you go ahead and point your finger and say
[14:12.480 --> 14:19.920]  I'm the bad guy I cannot believe how religiously sheepish the public is and
[14:19.920 --> 14:24.400]  even big tough guys they'll be big and tough to their neighbor big and tough to
[14:24.400 --> 14:27.600]  people they manage or big and tough to whoever but when they get around police
[14:27.600 --> 14:32.520]  or bureaucrats they're like little babies and they'll try to charm the TSA
[14:32.520 --> 14:36.680]  while they grow up their five-year-old daughter or son they'll get real skits
[14:36.680 --> 14:42.680]  fun to get scared isn't it but but boy let me tell you you'll sure swagger
[14:42.680 --> 14:47.760]  around at the pool look at every big guy that isn't as big and tough as you like
[14:47.760 --> 14:51.560]  they're a little wimp when I bet half those little guys out there will unscrew
[14:51.560 --> 15:00.800]  your head like a corkscrew the point is I am sick and tired of it see I've got
[15:00.800 --> 15:05.960]  all this news I just flashed back to that last night but I did notice as he
[15:05.960 --> 15:09.840]  said that that they didn't have in caps everywhere for the devil water that the
[15:09.840 --> 15:15.680]  the chemical weapon so see that's how it works you start trying to intimidate me
[15:15.680 --> 15:21.440]  I come right back at you oh well here's the video here's the video from CBS
[15:21.440 --> 15:31.200]  shot back in what I shot this back in March here it is look at this they're
[15:31.200 --> 15:35.680]  bombarding you everywhere with stuff that poisons you fluoride which the
[15:35.680 --> 15:40.560]  American Dental Association has admitted for five years children are five
[15:40.560 --> 15:44.200]  shooting burst their teeth with it or drink it check it out for yourself
[15:44.200 --> 15:51.200]  everywhere nursery water for the baby with fluoride and then you go down this
[15:51.200 --> 16:00.000]  aisle and it's you versus the flu at CVS get your flu shot when they admit
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.920]  that it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next year big Canadian
[16:02.920 --> 16:07.840]  studies and they admit they've never guessed the year before what the flu is
[16:07.840 --> 16:13.440]  gonna be the next year I mean total hoax totally worthless three flu shots and
[16:13.440 --> 16:16.560]  you double your chances of getting Alzheimer's just just Google that search
[16:16.560 --> 16:21.680]  it look it up they admit it and then down here more anti-human propaganda just
[16:21.680 --> 16:27.160]  everywhere is propaganda oh CVS you know buy their product because it's
[16:27.160 --> 16:30.400]  earth-friendly and again there's a lot of reasonable stuff environmentally but
[16:30.400 --> 16:34.000]  they tag this on to the whole eugenics anti-human agenda it's all about
[16:34.000 --> 16:38.720]  bossing you around making you feel guilty and you go through this place it
[16:38.720 --> 16:43.760]  is just everywhere everywhere and every store you go to just bombard you you

[17:00.600 --> 17:05.560]  next to the fluoride water for babies and the point is the guy part of the
[17:05.560 --> 17:09.800]  story I forgot to tell you in the conversation we had he's like yeah no
[17:09.800 --> 17:15.000]  it became a you know big thing in the company and a search was on or where the
[17:15.000 --> 17:19.960]  video was produced and I argued that it was my store I can tell it was my store
[17:19.960 --> 17:23.240]  but there's thousands of stores and so thank you for confirming it he was all
[17:23.240 --> 17:28.240]  looking at me like I was gonna literally defecate my pants listen here pal
[17:28.240 --> 17:34.020]  okay let me explain something to you this is how screwed up we've gotten how
[17:34.020 --> 17:38.200]  helpless we've become with Stockholm syndrome collectively learned
[17:38.200 --> 17:45.560]  helplessness I know the fluoride in that water many times higher than it is
[17:45.560 --> 17:49.440]  even in the city water is hurting little babies and is designed to reduce their
[17:49.440 --> 17:54.120]  IQ and I'm angry about it and I've been exposing Ozarka and others for about a
[17:54.120 --> 18:00.880]  decade since they came out with this okay in fact last night we don't watch a
[18:00.880 --> 18:04.600]  lot of television here I'm criticizing it but we got in bed about eight o'clock
[18:04.600 --> 18:08.160]  all the kids are sitting there on the floor they wanted to watch a nature show
[18:08.160 --> 18:13.080]  we let them watch TV maybe twice a week we turn on a show about crocodiles and
[18:13.080 --> 18:20.840]  during the ads it was new maximum strength fluoride called max fluoride or
[18:20.840 --> 18:23.760]  something like I meant to look it up when we got here today and it's for sore
[18:23.760 --> 18:29.400]  mouths we know your gums are bleeding and we know you've got a sore mouth so
[18:29.400 --> 18:35.760]  you need more fluoride well it's the fluoride actually causing that and it's
[18:35.760 --> 18:42.160]  just everywhere I mean I declare war on this I declare war on it and I think
[18:42.160 --> 18:46.760]  fluoride along with the TSA is one of the key areas we can really unify people
[18:46.760 --> 18:54.520]  along race religion color ethnicity whatever the case is it's time to get
[18:54.520 --> 18:58.480]  angry it's time to get aggressive you know in public schools nationwide at
[18:58.480 --> 19:01.800]  least five times a year they give them little fluoride pills that the kids are
[19:01.800 --> 19:06.320]  supposed to chew up that I remember being in public school kindergarten and
[19:06.320 --> 19:09.160]  then in first grade and then after that I was sent to private school for a while
[19:09.160 --> 19:12.840]  then back to public school in sixth grade but the point is I remember them
[19:12.840 --> 19:17.000]  bringing in it looked like candy and I remember getting sick and having to lay
[19:17.000 --> 19:21.600]  on the floor and vomiting in my mother's Volkswagen when she came to pick me up
[19:21.600 --> 19:29.880]  see I guess from age five I wasn't in a coma and I knew if I ate something that
[19:29.880 --> 19:33.320]  made me sick it's kind of like once we were at the coast and my parents went
[19:33.320 --> 19:37.360]  down to one of those seafood markets and bought some shrimp and made me eat it
[19:37.360 --> 19:40.280]  like oh come on it's good I got food poisoning from it I don't like shrimp
[19:40.280 --> 19:45.160]  today you know it just kind of works like that you know what I mean I just if
[19:45.160 --> 19:48.440]  I drink out of something and I get sick I don't like it anymore because I'm an
[19:48.440 --> 19:53.200]  extremist because I'm a bad man you know I told you 17 years ago world
[19:53.200 --> 19:56.920]  government run by banks was coming that they'd use a worldwide depression to
[19:56.920 --> 20:00.320]  bring you to your knees now they've done it does it make me right no I'm bad

[24:38.040 --> 24:55.320]  so I guess in a way I am a weirdo I mean when I know that fluoride is being added
[24:55.320 --> 24:59.880]  to baby formula it's being added to the water that they target just at babies
[24:59.880 --> 25:04.880]  while for six plus years it's admitted that babies shouldn't drink it we force
[25:04.880 --> 25:08.840]  them with the thousands of medical studies to admit that just like we
[25:08.840 --> 25:12.680]  forced them to admit that Prozac and other serotonin reuptake inhibitors is
[25:12.680 --> 25:19.600]  causing violent outbreaks and suicides but still they put it in our city water
[25:19.600 --> 25:28.880]  nationwide and worldwide. Where are the ambulance chasing lawyers on that front?
[25:28.880 --> 25:37.280]  Suzanne Puzzle has a great article again up at info wars.com breaking down what
[25:37.280 --> 25:41.400]  we've been covering last week US veterans forcibly sequestered mental
[25:41.400 --> 25:49.760]  hospitals is in definite detention. GOP make sure Ron Paul supporters get seats
[25:49.760 --> 25:56.960]  in nosebleed section of RNC. City to be watched by permanent eye in the sky Ron
[25:56.960 --> 26:01.280]  Paul just made the last speech of his political career. Ron Paul I don't fully
[26:01.280 --> 26:04.280]  endorse Romney for president well you can't because you're gonna endorse all
[26:04.280 --> 26:08.720]  his policies doesn't mean you support Obama either. Nosey neighbor call brings
[26:08.720 --> 26:12.040]  SWAT team down on gun owner just because they saw him cleaning a gun on his
[26:12.040 --> 26:16.520]  back porch and that even happens in Texas and the cops come they want to
[26:16.520 --> 26:19.080]  demonize the Second Amendment man I tell you it's just to create this
[26:19.080 --> 26:24.200]  perception it's illegal and of course what got me ranting a Portland Oregon
[26:24.200 --> 26:27.520]  to spend five million to poison its residents for toxic fluoride just
[26:27.520 --> 26:33.520]  incredible look at this AP interview with President Obama Obama calls Romney's
[26:33.520 --> 26:39.200]  ideas extreme really that he helped with the insurance companies write what you
[26:39.200 --> 26:43.600]  adopted as the fascist government health care plan not even socialists it's just
[26:43.600 --> 26:47.600]  it's a con job run by the insurance companies who aren't free market who
[26:47.600 --> 26:52.840]  are monopoly groups what about no child left behind he supported that you
[26:52.840 --> 27:00.160]  support that government federalization more of schools you supported carbon
[27:00.160 --> 27:06.160]  taxes he supports that he supports semi-auto bands you support that he
[27:06.160 --> 27:11.960]  supports abortion in the past you support that he supported the NDA you
[27:11.960 --> 27:16.520]  support that Obama he supported the Patriot Act extension you supported that
[27:16.520 --> 27:22.120]  he supported amnesty free legal aliens you've done that by fiat he supported
[27:22.120 --> 27:25.880]  shutting down power plants that aren't insiders he supports all this
[27:25.880 --> 27:29.840]  globalism that makes the ultra-rich exempt from taxes he supports all the
[27:29.840 --> 27:33.960]  corporate welfare you support I mean other than rhetoric yeah he doesn't come
[27:33.960 --> 27:37.640]  out and say you didn't build that you're there to kind of promote open
[27:37.640 --> 27:41.680]  communism at the grassroots to get everybody used to it and then he's
[27:41.680 --> 27:47.400]  there to play the part of the alternative so people think they have
[27:47.400 --> 27:55.120]  place to run it's kind of like the cartoon where the cat puts the fake
[27:55.120 --> 27:58.960]  theater entrance in front of its mouth with two different entrances so that
[27:58.960 --> 28:02.360]  the mouse feels like it has a choice of which entrance it goes in but it still
[28:02.360 --> 28:07.400]  goes down the cat's mouth I got old Tom and Jerry hadn't it sure many of you
[28:07.400 --> 28:11.720]  seen that that'd be a good good still to find on the web and make a cartoon out
[28:11.720 --> 28:18.120]  of anyway political cartoon I don't know so our civilization is crumbling I was
[28:18.120 --> 28:21.800]  this morning reading education numbers in the US and how they keep going down
[28:21.800 --> 28:25.760]  down down down literacy down down down down down and then I've got the
[28:25.760 --> 28:30.000]  Department of Education documents they're all in the book we sell deliberate
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.920]  dumbing down the new edition by the former head of policy at the Department
[28:32.920 --> 28:37.240]  of Education Charlotte Isherby
[28:37.240 --> 28:43.800]  and in there it shed in the 50s and 60s people are too educated they're too
[28:43.800 --> 28:47.680]  informed we're gonna dumb them down back then people went to school eight months
[28:47.680 --> 28:51.080]  out of the year now it's nine months ten months they want to get rid of you
[28:51.080 --> 28:56.040]  know as I was mentioning summer vacation period and now they're trying to put two
[28:56.040 --> 29:03.560]  year olds and three year olds in the government you know pre-k which will
[29:03.560 --> 29:07.640]  compete with the regular daycare centers that should be teaching basic
[29:07.640 --> 29:11.520]  reading writing and arithmetic and the parents should be but they've all been
[29:11.520 --> 29:15.080]  taught that's not cool to do just give your kids an age to the state so they
[29:15.080 --> 29:18.160]  can have all the vaccines and all the aspartame and have the Department of
[29:18.160 --> 29:21.920]  Defense cameras watching them in public schools nationwide don't believe me just
[29:21.920 --> 29:27.600]  type it in San Antonio New York you name it AI computers watching them cameras
[29:27.600 --> 29:32.400]  in the bathrooms and now citywide the Austin Independent School District is
[29:32.400 --> 29:37.120]  gonna put GPS trackers on the kids not just when they're in school when they're

[33:30.880 --> 33:51.720]  ladies and gentlemen I am the wild man the crazy man when I see the joint
[33:51.720 --> 33:57.440]  chiefs of staff and the chairman openly before Congress the House and the
[33:57.440 --> 34:00.640]  Senate in three different meetings and last year in a letter from the
[34:00.640 --> 34:06.320]  president tell him that NATO now commands our military I get upset when I
[34:06.320 --> 34:10.200]  see hundreds of financial publications announced world government has been
[34:10.200 --> 34:15.200]  established and the head of the EU the head of England all the major globalist
[34:15.200 --> 34:20.000]  heads the CFR announced we've been conquered and actually laugh at us and
[34:20.000 --> 34:25.800]  rub it in I get upset when the city where I live has shut down two of the city
[34:25.800 --> 34:30.440]  owned power plants doubling prices and is now going to shut the third mega plant
[34:30.440 --> 34:36.400]  down and I watch my power bills explode and I watch poor people go bankrupt I
[34:36.400 --> 34:42.080]  get angry but but again I'm a bad person when people are cheating me and
[34:42.080 --> 34:46.840]  screwing me politically and financially and laughing at me in my face I get
[34:46.840 --> 34:53.480]  angry because it is a bad thing in a culture that has just given up and that
[34:53.480 --> 34:58.640]  is in a trance zombie state to care and be involved but I know you the listeners
[34:58.640 --> 35:02.320]  of this worldwide broadcast you haven't given up and you see people starting to
[35:02.320 --> 35:05.800]  wake up out of their mind numb stupor and we can see people go from being
[35:05.800 --> 35:12.040]  completely brain dead and totally unaware to waking up overnight that's why
[35:12.040 --> 35:16.000]  we're planting seeds sometimes they wake up right away sometimes they wake up in
[35:16.000 --> 35:20.120]  five years sometimes they never wake up but more often than not people are
[35:20.120 --> 35:24.840]  waking up and you hear them call in they go I'm a police officer I woke up 14
[35:24.840 --> 35:28.840]  months ago they and they want to tell you when they woke up or I'm an Air Force
[35:28.840 --> 35:32.320]  officer or I'm a school teacher and I woke up or I'm a lawyer or I'm a state
[35:32.320 --> 35:40.920]  representative and I woke up because it is waking up you're like whoa I sometimes
[35:40.920 --> 35:44.880]  it's walking out in your backyard and a police drone's taking video of you other
[35:44.880 --> 35:48.840]  times your child comes home and says yeah we were told to tell Pete the school
[35:48.840 --> 35:52.080]  what's in the medicine cabinet and you haven't done anything wrong but you're
[35:52.080 --> 35:56.840]  like in America the school wants to know what's in my medicine cabinet ladies
[35:56.840 --> 36:02.040]  and gentlemen we are so far down the rat hole here's the good news we can
[36:02.040 --> 36:06.800]  always stop going down the rat hole and start back anytime we want the
[36:06.800 --> 36:12.920]  globalist relish and crave control they crave you being in the dark they crave
[36:12.920 --> 36:18.400]  you not being aware I have what I could only describe as a lust but lust is a
[36:18.400 --> 36:24.880]  sin so but that's the only way I can describe an absolute
[36:24.880 --> 36:34.360]  over-driving relish to unlock minds I absolutely cannot stand scam artists I
[36:34.360 --> 36:42.480]  absolutely cannot stand bullies I absolutely love seeing people successful
[36:42.480 --> 36:53.000]  I just love it I'll say it again I'm a fan of man to quote Al Pacino playing
[36:53.000 --> 36:59.480]  the devil in devil's advocate with Keanu Reeves great movie but you know
[36:59.480 --> 37:05.280]  there's a lie there when the devil says I'm a fan of man he's not the devil
[37:05.280 --> 37:09.560]  hates mankind and wants to kill mankind the devil comes to kill steal and
[37:09.560 --> 37:16.320]  destroy because we're made in the image of the Creator the angels aren't ladies
[37:16.320 --> 37:21.840]  and gentlemen now again even if you don't believe in God and see that more as
[37:21.840 --> 37:27.560]  an archetype the point is the people we're fighting operate just like the
[37:27.560 --> 37:32.200]  fallen angels that are described in the Bible and every other ancient culture the
[37:32.200 --> 37:39.920]  people running things love to see famine and death and war and starving children
[37:39.920 --> 37:44.520]  you see innocence and want to protect it they want to shake it around by the
[37:44.520 --> 37:53.400]  neck like a crocodile grabbing a baby dog that's what they're looking for that's
[37:53.400 --> 37:57.520]  what they want and I'm now ranting we're gonna go to your phone calls until Joe
[37:57.520 --> 38:02.200]  Farah joins us we'll take calls when Farah's on with us as well but we'll clear
[38:02.200 --> 38:05.160]  the phone decks at that time once he's on so you can call on all the specific
[38:05.160 --> 38:08.120]  issues we're covering for your questions for him but here's the toll free number
[38:08.120 --> 38:16.200]  800-259-9231 800-2599-231 one big program note that I'll hit a
[38:16.200 --> 38:21.480]  smattering of other news and then go to your calls here is the final official
[38:21.480 --> 38:34.480]  version of info wars magazine we did multiple prints notice one is smaller
[38:34.480 --> 38:38.920]  than the other more square notice that has a you're watching on prison planet
[38:38.920 --> 38:47.560]  TV has an orange arrow the final one has a blue one the 40,000 of you that
[38:47.560 --> 38:57.080]  ordered in bulk the magazine it's being shipped out to you now we had to stop
[38:57.080 --> 39:02.400]  there in 36 hours we sold let's be technical 36,000 copies because we
[39:02.400 --> 39:06.440]  held back 4,000 so that when we come out with subscriptions next month you can
[39:06.440 --> 39:11.680]  get the first issue and the next 12 that'll be how it works whoever said
[39:11.680 --> 39:16.240]  13 was unlucky that's our first 13 colonies first 13 stars the point is
[39:16.240 --> 39:26.040]  that you can still get the final product a free digital copy at info wars.com
[39:26.040 --> 39:30.320]  forward slash newsletter because so many people been requesting and our office
[39:30.320 --> 39:35.360]  has been inundated there's one way to get it info wars.com forward slash
[39:35.360 --> 39:39.760]  newsletter sign up put your email in it's free you'll get our daily news
[39:39.760 --> 39:44.800]  briefings special videos everything sent to you daily but also we'll just keep
[39:44.800 --> 39:48.960]  adding it I guess every time the email goes out so that everybody can get it
[39:48.960 --> 39:51.960]  because people just keep asking and asking and asking so info wars.com
[39:51.960 --> 39:57.680]  forward slash newsletter and we're trying to figure out shipping where we're
[39:57.680 --> 40:04.120]  going to ship this outside the office because obviously if we can sell 36,000
[40:04.120 --> 40:08.000]  and 36 hours that's about a thousand an hour I never thought of that but it took
[40:08.000 --> 40:21.800]  36 hours day and a half to sell out to sell out 36,000 and I'm sure a lot of
[40:21.800 --> 40:24.360]  that's interested it's the first edition but once you get it I mean it what a
[40:24.360 --> 40:28.400]  tool to wake people up we're only going to print 50,000 this next run of the
[40:28.400 --> 40:33.200]  October issue that'll be done in late September but I'm digressing unless I
[40:33.200 --> 40:36.360]  can find and guys I'm getting into the newspaper business I got to figure out
[40:36.360 --> 40:40.320]  who you use off-site how the labeling I can keep it affordable for the
[40:40.320 --> 40:44.200]  subscriptions and this is our answer to the internet kill switch you know we're
[40:44.200 --> 40:48.600]  we're dominating the web thanks to you spreading the word and our hard work and
[40:48.600 --> 40:56.080]  the fact that I'm angry and cut through people's Stockholm syndrome or and if
[40:56.080 --> 40:59.200]  you know if you're a new listener don't know what Stockholm syndrome is people
[40:59.200 --> 41:05.000]  get kidnapped and about 40% of the time studies show depending on the culture
[41:05.000 --> 41:09.280]  they end up serving and defending their abusers and kidnappers I don't call it
[41:09.280 --> 41:14.240]  Stockholm I call it total cowardice you see I've discovered that cowards play
[41:14.240 --> 41:19.680]  mind games with themselves and tell themselves that somehow they're still
[41:19.680 --> 41:24.440]  winning because cowardice has more to do with denial and delusion than even
[41:24.440 --> 41:28.920]  cowardice a coward is so afraid that they're about to be marched into a pit
[41:28.920 --> 41:33.640]  and shot in the back of the head that they run in and hold their hat and even
[41:33.640 --> 41:38.920]  bow politely to those that are about to shoot them when I would have already
[41:38.920 --> 41:43.320]  attacked the people long before and wouldn't be in that position or if they
[41:43.320 --> 41:47.320]  would have somehow gotten me to that sandbank and that mass grave full of
[41:47.320 --> 41:50.840]  bodies that were already shot and we're telling me and ten more guys to run on
[41:50.840 --> 41:54.800]  there and be shot I probably would act groveling and then I would leap at
[41:54.800 --> 42:00.360]  someone and rip their throat out not because I'm a tough guy but because I'm
[42:00.360 --> 42:05.400]  an animal ladies and gentlemen I'm in my natural form or close to it which
[42:05.400 --> 42:10.440]  they've tried to engineer out of you any mammal out there when cornered will get
[42:10.440 --> 42:14.600]  its hair up and get its teeth out and will attack you in a piranha mode not
[42:14.600 --> 42:19.360]  because a raccoons tough or strutting around acting tough not because a wolf
[42:19.360 --> 42:24.360]  is tough not because a bear is tough not because a badger is tough it's just
[42:24.360 --> 42:29.280]  gonna fight you and we've got to get to that point and rediscover when we're
[42:29.280 --> 42:35.880]  cornered under attack to not cower and roll over because ladies and gentlemen
[42:35.880 --> 42:44.480]  rolling over is not gonna protect you unless you're a possum and by the way
[42:44.480 --> 42:48.760]  the possums one of the only animals of marsupial that can roll over and a lot
[42:48.760 --> 42:54.360]  of times not be eaten and do you know why they do that do you know why they
[42:54.360 --> 42:58.600]  do that because they secrete out of glands something that smells like
[42:58.600 --> 43:05.280]  they're poisonous and and and sick that's the other part of the equation so it
[43:05.280 --> 43:08.920]  works for them some of the time because they stink so bad they don't smell
[43:08.920 --> 43:17.200]  tasty so rolling over doesn't protect you and from birth everybody's taught to
[43:17.200 --> 43:21.800]  comply I watch I people watch in their childlike they're goofy they're giggly
[43:21.800 --> 43:27.040]  they just want everything to be happy and you know what that is a recipe that's
[43:27.040 --> 43:30.760]  the equivalent of going off the coast of San Diego for a month straight and
[43:30.760 --> 43:34.920]  dumping rotten chicken blood in the water do you know what will come if you
[43:34.920 --> 43:39.400]  roll over and act like a limp-wristed chicken-necked coward who just begs to
[43:39.400 --> 43:45.400]  have their life run the biggest baddest meanest shark is gonna swim 50 miles if
[43:45.400 --> 43:51.080]  they have to and we'll show up you dump blood in the water long enough big old
[43:51.080 --> 43:55.920]  sharks are gonna show up and we don't have a Bill of Rights or Constitution
[43:55.920 --> 44:04.720]  Declaration of Independence anymore we don't have a shark cage anymore you are
[44:04.720 --> 44:09.640]  swimming around in the ocean in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of
[44:09.640 --> 44:15.240]  California filled with great white sharks in a giant sack of rotten fish
[44:15.240 --> 44:18.920]  heads and monkey guts
[44:18.920 --> 44:27.200]  and that's why you're in so much trouble because you are a mark this whole
[44:27.200 --> 44:32.880]  country is seen by the globalist as the dumbest most prepared to be raped
[44:32.880 --> 44:38.520]  people the world has ever seen and you know why you were the dumbest and the
[44:38.520 --> 44:42.720]  most ready to be raped because we were the freest so we produced so much wealth
[44:42.720 --> 44:52.080]  we became spoiled brats and now it is a religion to be a spoiled brat it is a
[44:52.080 --> 44:56.480]  religion people wear it like an armor I told the story on the radio yesterday
[44:56.480 --> 45:00.360]  but I'll tell it briefly and go to your calls I wanted to surprise the Sunday
[45:00.360 --> 45:03.640]  crew and I've never gone to this well I'd eat it before but I've never gone
[45:03.640 --> 45:07.040]  there I always tell stories and too much to tell there's this soup peddler place
[45:07.040 --> 45:12.280]  that has soup and sandwiches so I pull in there I put in the order I'm sitting
[45:12.280 --> 45:16.960]  there waiting about 10 minutes for it and my enough like five copies of my
[45:16.960 --> 45:20.000]  magazine are left from I guess a hundred that got left there a few days
[45:20.000 --> 45:23.760]  before pretty darn good the other publications were big stacks show my
[45:23.760 --> 45:28.240]  newspaper slash magazines almost gone I go yeah let me read that I'm like oh

[45:35.440 --> 45:38.920]  pick up one of the copies go Alex Jones cool they don't see me sitting there
[45:38.920 --> 45:43.640]  because my hair is all disheveled I've been swimming laps and exercising my
[45:43.640 --> 45:46.240]  wife had left with the kids I've gone over there about to go to work you got
[45:46.240 --> 45:50.520]  changed here at the office but side-issue I'm all disheveled sunglasses on hair in
[45:50.520 --> 45:54.000]  my face sitting out there in a hundred degree heat loving every minute of it
[45:54.000 --> 45:58.640]  and they're like oh cool Alex Jones this guy this girl from government order
[45:58.640 --> 46:02.800]  blah blah blah but then a little trendy comes over with his girlfriend and he
[46:02.800 --> 46:08.440]  goes oh no oh no none of Alex Jones magazine and all of a sudden they're
[46:08.440 --> 46:12.520]  looking at it and I'm right here by the racks a little area outside the set
[46:12.520 --> 46:19.440]  there's no inside at that place and he goes and will seize me actually makes
[46:19.440 --> 46:23.280]  a little because they make that as they're as their call that I've rolled
[46:23.280 --> 46:29.200]  over I've given into everything I'm complying just like that Facebook cue it

[47:24.800 --> 47:29.480]  they're sitting there hula hooping and giggling at me and I thought that is the
[47:29.480 --> 47:33.000]  spirit of the new world order I don't want them drinking fluoride I don't
[47:33.000 --> 47:37.720]  want foreign banks robbing them I don't want world government and they are
[47:37.720 --> 47:42.040]  laughing at me hula hooping getting into the fact that they don't care about

[49:36.520 --> 49:40.400]  I'll tell you my own personal experience with face but when the Iowa caucuses
[49:40.400 --> 49:47.440]  started I was a permanent Ron Paul supporter they suspended me for 90 days
[49:47.440 --> 49:51.160]  got me through the caucuses and everything quite nicely that really
[49:51.160 --> 49:56.160]  wasn't what I was calling about though what I was calling about is I've
[49:56.160 --> 50:00.840]  recently moved to the state of Washington out to the coast I bought
[50:00.840 --> 50:06.880]  e-foods I have my own garden I collect oysters and clams that's not trying off
[50:06.880 --> 50:12.520]  of the grid no I'm sorry but there's no birds here Alex and I was wondering if

[54:40.640 --> 54:44.600]  come in the garage and it looks at you you ever live your garage open you walk
[54:44.600 --> 54:47.960]  in there's a big old raccoon sitting there it looks real friendly and slow and
[54:47.960 --> 54:52.040]  but if you start aggressively coming over towards it it will hiss at you and
[54:52.040 --> 54:57.080]  rush at you snapping and clawing and so I'm just a normal mammal bunch of
[54:57.080 --> 55:02.440]  tyrants running things I'm hissing and clawing and snapping yeah because I'm
[55:02.440 --> 55:08.440]  got a survival instinct and yeah guys will you actually pull up or print since
[55:08.440 --> 55:15.960]  he mentions it seals dying hair falling out of airline attendance I'll be
[55:15.960 --> 55:22.920]  unpolitically correct stewardesses and their hair is falling out and radiation
[55:22.920 --> 55:27.080]  levels have gone up and it turned out that that that yellow and bluefin tuna
[55:27.080 --> 55:32.400]  had already come across the ocean and just four months after Fukushima the
[55:32.400 --> 55:37.000]  feds were testing the fish and still letting you eat it just huge levels of
[55:37.000 --> 55:41.880]  different radioactive isotopes because five reactors blew up three of them
[55:41.880 --> 55:48.800]  completely much bigger than Chernobyl but hey back then you know they said
[55:48.800 --> 55:52.440]  take precautions now they just said hey we're raising the level of what's safe
[55:52.440 --> 55:57.720]  after all that's what's trendy that's what's cool is to not be threatened by
[55:57.720 --> 56:01.600]  real threats but to be threatened by fake threats and to have no common sense
[56:01.600 --> 56:05.320]  if you're like here's the I'm talking about this with Joseph Farah Britain and
[56:05.320 --> 56:10.760]  US plan a Syrian revolution from the innocuous office block in Istanbul I
[56:10.760 --> 56:15.600]  here's another one Libyan commander admits fighters are al-Qaeda show that's
[56:15.600 --> 56:20.720]  London a telegraph to show me it's all admitted but I need to give my rights up
[56:20.720 --> 56:23.920]  because al-Qaeda who the government got on the plane with the underwear bomber
[56:23.920 --> 56:28.240]  drugged and who the government criminally runs but I'm not supposed to be able to
[56:28.240 --> 56:31.760]  make that distinction hey you run al-Qaeda but I need to give my rights up
[56:31.760 --> 56:36.360]  you just want to take my rights you're criminal or hey radiation levels went up
[56:36.360 --> 56:43.520]  all over the US but you just raise them and said they're safe see we've entered
[56:43.520 --> 56:48.400]  a the elite themselves are delusional I'm sorry Ernest Ernest you're on the
[56:48.400 --> 56:52.600]  air finish your point about the no birds there a lot of that's the aluminum
[56:52.600 --> 56:56.080]  dioxide bird numbers are weighed out a lot of the trees on the west coast are
[56:56.080 --> 56:59.160]  dying and it's all part of the geo engineering program we're going to talk
[56:59.160 --> 57:02.720]  about the third hour it's it's real sad that aluminum levels and the soils are
[57:02.720 --> 57:05.960]  going up everywhere and but don't worry Monsanto is going to come out with every
[57:05.960 --> 57:09.560]  tree and plant there is with new seeds that have been engineered to survive it
[57:09.560 --> 57:15.840]  isn't that nice of them that's wonderful Alex yeah you know the the situation is
[57:15.840 --> 57:19.840]  is that we've had this property for a number of years there's always been
[57:19.840 --> 57:25.680]  finch blue jays crush robins there's none of those this year that's a
[57:25.680 --> 57:29.720]  conspiracy theory I told you in the future if someone that says women
[57:29.720 --> 57:33.640]  wants breastfed they'll be arrested I'm not joking if people in the future say
[57:33.640 --> 57:37.760]  that humans ever walk without robotic aid they'll be arrested but I mean
[57:37.760 --> 57:41.440]  lifetime neural implants won't even let you say it in the future which they're
[57:41.440 --> 57:45.320]  now announcing it's over humans aren't going to space it's the end of
[57:45.320 --> 57:48.720]  humanity the globalist plan on exterminating everybody except for a
[57:48.720 --> 57:51.800]  few of them that are going to merge with computers that's their stated plan
[57:51.800 --> 57:55.960]  yes they're killing everything well and the other thing is with the weather
[57:55.960 --> 58:00.440]  manipulation they've managed to make it so my tomatoes are just flowering now
[58:00.440 --> 58:05.160]  my pumpkins are just flowering now everything is behind at least two months
[58:05.160 --> 58:08.640]  in my garden so whether I'm going to get anything by the time the season is
[58:08.640 --> 58:11.960]  over not we'll see well I mean they said weather would be used as a weapon
[58:11.960 --> 58:15.240]  State Department random 200 and they are and they admit they're chem trailing and
[58:15.240 --> 58:18.200]  doing everything they can and don't worry they're coming out with hundreds of
[58:18.200 --> 58:22.640]  GMO crops that'll only be able to grow so isn't that a nice thing by them I mean
[58:22.640 --> 58:26.600]  they're good people well my tomatoes have a lot of free flowers that's all I can
[58:26.600 --> 58:32.600]  say well sir you need to just understand that the New World Order knows best

[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:40.120]  GPS devices parental responsibilities eviscerated state takes over let's go
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:49.720]  to CJ in Michigan CJ you're on the air welcome sir. Hey brother thank you yeah
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:56.200]  I hear you going back and forth you know contemplating Obama Mitt Romney and the
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:02.680]  choice and this is Matt I really haven't I haven't got where you're at what are
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:08.760]  you gonna do are you gonna vote for one my take on it is you know voting for
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:15.800]  anyone it's consenting to it and I just can't consent to this tyranny so the
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:20.200]  rest are two evils to me I just never got into that. Well there's two schools of
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:24.400]  thought Obama gets back in they accelerate things so fast that people
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:27.640]  finally completely wake up that's probably why the ruling class is now
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:32.480]  switching over to Obama or Romney I'm excuse me
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:36.920]  Obamni oh Romney I can't even get his name straight there we go that wasn't on
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:42.720]  purpose I couldn't even figure out his name Obamni or Romney 2012 the the
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:47.040]  establishment is shifting over to Romney because they know they can't get
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:51.840]  their agenda through with Obama anymore but some are saying that they're going
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:56.720]  with Romney because they are actually scared of Obama that he's even moving
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:01.520]  too quickly but the reason we see all this happening is because the ruling
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:06.680]  establishment who are monopoly people who are anti-free market who make their
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:09.600]  money off corporate welfare and want to be able to shut down their competition
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:15.480]  they are running the show this is what they want it's just that now they're in
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:19.840]  such control that they can't control themselves and so it's more of a battle
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:25.560]  within the ruling class how far do they want to go and because once you have a
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:30.640]  criminal system the worst individuals in the criminal hierarchy are who will
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:36.600]  steer the boat and so it's a race to the bottom and so I listen I didn't vote
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:42.440]  in the 2008 election because I said it's clear Obama's that shows in Prince
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:46.040]  there'll be election fraud of he isn't and John McCain is just there as a
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:53.800]  placeholder like Bob Dole in 1996 with Clinton and so again it's all theater
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:58.560]  the only other issue is as Joe Farrah has said and he's about to come on when
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:03.080]  Bush was in I could say anything about him and didn't really have a bunch of
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:08.120]  dirty tricks go on I have had dirty tricks when Obama's been in and I have
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:11.240]  had them come after me I've had their surrogates say I should be shut down
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:16.040]  try to connect me to cop killing for media matters and the Southern
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:19.160]  Parvy Law Center and others and I've had a lot of other stuff you know behind the
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:23.440]  scenes go on so when Joe Farrah just says hey they've already put you in the
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:27.320]  Republican camp because you're for guns and against abortion and that's that's
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:34.360]  true at a sophisticated level the power structure sees me as a conservative
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:38.720]  libertarian constitutionalist because I am for freedom and at least in rhetoric
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:42.720]  look at the Republican platform a lot of great libertarian constitutional stuff
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:47.320]  the Texas Republican platform is excellent it's like I wrote it it's like
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:53.120]  a John Birch Society document but they don't follow it so because my rhetoric
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:58.520]  which I actually stand for is similar rhetoric to the Republicans the leftist
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:02.760]  power structure that's a big part of the New World Order sees me as the enemy and
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:09.360]  so whether I join Romney or not I've already been put in with Romney do you
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:15.880]  see what I'm saying yep so I mean what do I do because the system already sees
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:19.240]  me that way so I mean I just kind of stand out here oh well I don't like
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:25.200]  Romney either but but I'll guarantee I mean I've been through Republicans and
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:30.640]  Democrats and Democrats go after their opposition because they're more of a
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:35.920]  mafia Chicago New York style because they came up from the gutter Republicans
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:40.000]  are more blue blood criminals who do it all with a parlance through the power
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.840]  structure I'll ask that question of Joe Farrah straight ahead and those of you
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:46.600]  that are holding you'll get to address your question to myself or Joe Farrah
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.520]  we're gonna take some calls with Joe today on a host of issues we're gonna
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:53.160]  cover the serious situation with al-qaeda we're gonna cover the Iran

[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:22.880]  talking to Joseph Farah the editor-in-chief of world net daily I am
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:30.160]  alex jones your host and we have got Obama coming out an associated press
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:35.200]  interview saying that Romney's ideas are extreme really I mean I thought Romney
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:40.880]  was almost just like Obama carbon taxes open borders abortions assault weapons
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:44.840]  bans I mean now he says he's different but in action he's pretty much like
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:51.880]  Obama so what is Obama talking about there we have got massive draconian gun
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:56.920]  control legislation at the state level in multiple east coast states seeking to
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:00.400]  get rid of the manufacturer in those states we're gonna be going over that
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:06.320]  we have got so much to cover here today but I wanted to get Joseph Farah on to
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:12.640]  give us his take on election 2012 and where he sees it going what a another
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:18.000]  four years of Obama versus Romney would look like but then I want to get into a
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:25.600]  report he put out a few days ago headlined at WND dot com when Israel
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:30.280]  strikes Iran in October so now he's saying when they strike and I've never
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:35.160]  seen the war more green-lighted it's been green-lighted before and then backed
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:39.000]  off but from every source it looks like it's going that way and I want to see
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.760]  how that ties in with the London Telegraph now admitting when I reported
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:48.120]  nine months ago when the Syria destabilization began that Britain in the
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:54.400]  US or the banks that run us and run our military are running al-Qaeda and are
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:59.200]  trying to overthrow Syria I'm no fan of Assad but man that this is al-Qaeda that
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:06.200]  is admitted is the main fighting force and all of that is going on and now
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:10.440]  they're saying that they're wonderful freedom fighters when they go in and
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:15.560]  strap men in cars with bombs and say we're gonna kill your family if you
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:20.000]  don't go blow up a police checkpoint I mean this is on television now and our
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.560]  media is like isn't torture good isn't secret arrest good isn't al-Qaeda good the
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:31.360]  CFR three weeks ago one of their writers said quote we need al-Qaeda so talk
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:36.320]  about a new level of immorality I know Joseph Ferris there in Virginia he has
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:40.840]  a lot of sources now in the military industrial complex and he can tell us
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:45.560]  what he thinks the grand strategy is and where all of this is going all the
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:50.480]  preparations for collapse you name it Joseph Farah is founder editor and CEO
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:53.880]  of world net daily a nationally syndicated columnist for creator syndicate
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:57.760]  he's the author of co-author of 13 books including his latest the tea party
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:02.520]  manifesto and it's classic taking America back now in its third edition in
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:06.320]  14th printing Farah is the former editor of the legendary Sacramento Union
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:13.240]  and other major market dailies and he joins us now to break all of this down
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:16.440]  you also set the Western Journalism Center we'll talk about the attempts to
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:21.920]  censor the web as well and have an internet tax by the FCC that Google and
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:26.200]  others are want yeah because it shuts down their competition all of that and
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:30.840]  more with Joseph Farah today but first off I know we got you on a few minutes
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:34.840]  early and you heard that caller or if you didn't hear the caller was saying
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:39.280]  well what do you do if Romney and Obama are basically the same but different
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:46.080]  rhetoric do you morally not vote for Romney and because it almost acquiesces
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:50.080]  or gives credence to it and I see that point but then what do you do when
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:54.320]  you're somebody like Joseph Farah or Alex Jones where even though you said
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:59.560]  hey don't vote for McCain or Obama four years ago you were put in the camp by the
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:04.480]  Obama people and they've gone after you so yes I'm put in the camp of Romney
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:11.560]  even though I'm not in it what do you say to all that well Alex Jones I listen
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:17.040]  to your response to that caller and I have to tell you that was a very coherent
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:24.360]  concise articulate response it really resonates with you know what I'm thinking
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:31.600]  what's within my soul in this election yeah as you know in 2008 we were we were
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:37.040]  both you know none of the above but people and right now we're wrestling
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:44.960]  with survival you know my my my thought back in 2008 was hey you know what I
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:51.960]  mean if what's the difference with the coin I knew that Obama was going to be
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:59.240]  a more tyrannical kind of repressive president you know clamping down on
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:07.080]  liberty and more dramatic ways faster but you know I also thought well maybe
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:12.240]  that's you know maybe Americans need that as a wake-up call because you know
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:16.960]  you can take the slow road you know to hell and people don't even recognize
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:22.080]  where you're going but sometimes you know being on the highway to hell people
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:27.200]  say hey time to do a u-turn and I thought we saw a little bit of that you
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:31.080]  know in the 20th and election obviously there was you know as the tea party
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:39.560]  movement arose and so you know I think that that feeling was somewhat
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:45.320]  validated but then again Alex I have to say I think to a great extent the tea
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:50.680]  party movement was hijacked by special interests and in 2012 I don't know we
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:55.920]  get to be determined how much of a force they're going to be but I think you're
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:02.560]  right we've got a limited choice here I mean there's what they used to say now
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:07.680]  the time is worth it different but there is because as I mentioned the last time
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:16.360]  I was with you I think and I hope I'm not just you know justifying my own gut
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:21.040]  instincts here in my own self-preservation but but I really believe
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:27.520]  that if Obama's reelected there is no chance for turning this country around
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:35.360]  no chance whatsoever and so you know I'm not gonna be you know endorsing Mitt
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:40.600]  Romney for president on your show here but I do believe that for people like
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:47.080]  you and me and Liberty activists across this country we do need a little
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:56.600]  breathing in the next four years well here's another example Ron Paul who did
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:01.080]  not endorse McCain four years ago has come out with a limited endorsement
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:06.280]  saying I won't fully endorse Romney but that shows how bad Obama is that the
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:12.040]  sense is he's gotten all his criminals in place and so even rearranging deck
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:17.280]  chairs it'll take the bureaucracy a while to kind of get its new scams in
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:22.180]  place with Romney but that with Obama not facing re-election he will drop the
[01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:27.160]  hammer and even if Romney's horrible he'll at least be facing re-election I
[01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:34.120]  think that's exactly right yeah you think about what a lame duck second term
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:41.880]  administration of Obama will be like no no guardrails you know and
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:48.600]  so as I said in a program the last time I was on with you for people like Alex
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:53.760]  Jones and Joseph Farah I gotta tell you I'm being very honest with you I think
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:58.000]  if Obama's re-elected guys like you and me are either gonna be in jail or gonna
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.200]  be dead I don't I don't think I don't and I don't think there's I think the
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:08.720]  chances for doing a U-turn terms of American policy preserving freedom and
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:14.040]  so forth we may be on an irreversible course with with four more years of
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:20.720]  Obama what do you make of all of the amazing stories where they're coming
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:24.800]  out and saying the army's training to take on a tea party insurrection that
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:29.680]  links up with Al Qaeda and army training for gun confiscation I mean these are
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:36.200]  confirmed manuals that are out there just incredibly seditious absolutely and
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:42.560]  you know I think it I think it ties in you know people that they think this is
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:48.040]  far-fetched right but then you look at the facts we know for sure about you
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:53.440]  know fast and furious and operation like that and we say you know if if the
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:57.720]  government can get away with that if the Obama administration can get away with
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:03.800]  that the most powerful people in the world just the facts on the table there's
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:08.240]  no accountability whatsoever what happened that congressional investigation
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:14.520]  well you know what what happened to this to those subpoenas what where the
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:20.160]  calls for impeachment by the Republican it just it just withered and died on
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:26.760]  the vine and so you know I think that I think that when you see that you see
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:35.760]  that people were killed gunned down by it through an official action ordered by
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:40.240]  the president by the way he was taking credit for fast and furious before it
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:49.560]  became you know a scandal and you know so it's mind-boggling Alex you know I
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:55.840]  we just got to be very very careful I'm so proud of you for getting a word out
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:01.400]  about these things you're doing a great job and I'm just hoping that the more
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:05.200]  of the American people become aware of what what's what's happening our
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:10.200]  liberties are being trampled underfoot expanding on that it came out over a
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:13.880]  year ago as you know even in Politico but they were reporting on like it was
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:20.360]  cute that media matters funded by the White House and George Soros had
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:25.240]  infiltrated news core and other media and of course you're on their radar I'm
[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:31.360]  on their radar and said we're going to sabotage and destroy people from within
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:36.000]  it's our job to destroy organizations from within this is like a foreign army
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.560]  or something and they don't even get in trouble they don't lose their 501 C3
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:47.040]  that is the difference it shows you that these are real zealots who really do
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:52.280]  want to silence their opposition yeah there's a totalitarian mindset here
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:56.880]  that it's hard for people like us to even understand you know it's so far into
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:05.040]  the way we think and this is what we're dealing with this is the mentality of you
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:09.120]  know people in the White House today it's the mentality of the you know you
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:14.000]  talk about the ruling class there's also a ruling culture out there you know
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.440]  from from the media establishment can't certain things you can't talk about
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:26.040]  they're perfectly comfortable with submitting their their questions to you
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:33.120]  know the president even even to Romney now when they when they do interviews
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:37.000]  with Romney they're already getting they're already submitting their quotes
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:43.880]  back to Romney it's just a it's just a crazy mess it's a total sheepish lapdog
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:48.560]  mentality I want to come back and ask you because I don't even know what's
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:52.400]  number one on your radar what's front and center on Joseph Ferris plate then
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:59.880]  we're gonna look at the rise of Al Qaeda as an ally of the West stay with us
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:04.920]  the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:09.240]  the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought

[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:37.440]  fighting the construction of a prison planet this is a short segment I want
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:43.160]  to get into the October surprise and the intel that Joseph Farrah has I mean he
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:47.240]  has it right here in his headline when Israel strikes Iran in October so we'll
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:52.500]  we'll we'll get that exclusive info and it is an exclusive that Joseph's gonna
[01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:57.400]  give us here and tie that into al Qaeda now we're being told how wonderful they
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:01.640]  are bringing down Libyan now trying to bring down Syria but when I was at his
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:07.080]  office covering Bilderberg in June he said they're in Virginia just a few
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:10.880]  miles away he said hey have you ever seen a drone I said no I didn't see one in
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:14.760]  person and then a week later after I left his house in a rural area got
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:18.800]  buzzed driving into work a few weeks ago I stopped saw one right over the highway
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:23.280]  highway department had a drone out there so massive proliferation we'll have to
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:27.760]  talk about that a little bit later well I mean why not now I mean well there is
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:33.080]  this big rollout of our tax money to militarize against us and now TSA on
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:37.720]  the streets everywhere Joseph see a police state Alex you should be here
[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:42.560]  with me and Tampa you know first of all we got the you know the hurricane
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:49.480]  threat and lots of concern about that of course the convention and
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:54.280]  demonstrations but the the there's National Guard all over the street I
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:26:00.120]  mean you can't get within a mile or two of the convention center I wish they'd
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:09.480]  make the border like that amazing it's a great point but you know you you stop
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:14.840]  but you walking on the street you know in your in my case in a suit and tie
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:19.840]  you're you're you're gonna be you know ask where you're going all this kind of
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:25.560]  stuff and it's really it just reminds me enough how we've lost the the the
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:33.040]  America that you and I knew as kids and so they do that on purpose they they
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:37.240]  have these national security events worldwide and just use it to promote the
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:41.080]  police state and the end of due process but we were talking during the break you
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:45.080]  said your power was out yesterday of there in Tampa yeah with a limited thing
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:51.600]  and my hotel was completely out for about four hours and that was lovely you
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:55.440]  know the whole time I'm thinking what am I doing here there's nothing going on
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:01.600]  there's absolutely no news I should be home I could I know more about what was
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:07.000]  going on I got you know you lose power he's got it oh yeah you can dial in on
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.680]  a hundred different video feeds watch all the other people that's why I never
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:13.320]  go anywhere because I can just sit right here and have the whole world yeah
[01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:20.960]  good call I didn't do it I didn't do it in 2008 I forgot I did it had done it
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:26.280]  2004 and felt like I was you know you're supposed to be in the center of things
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:30.680]  when you're covering an event like that but you you don't have the perspective
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:36.480]  you have when you're you know on the internet sure I mean in 2004 I got to
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:40.760]  walk around and had my seat in my press passes and got to see Arnold Schwarzenegger
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:46.720]  talk about protecting und homeland which was very surreal a guy talking about the
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:51.840]  homeland and the German accent when it's your father and I got to you know see
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:56.800]  old man Bush creeping around I mean big deal yeah I mean I guess it's only good
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:59.880]  to get interviewed by media the only reason you'd want to go is to get
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:03.480]  interviewed and I did get on a bunch of national TV but something I mean I guess
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:08.040]  it is okay for that if you want to get publicity which is important for any
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:11.800]  media organization one of the things I wanted to do is be here to help support
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:17.200]  Aaron Kline who's got a you know a big book out there and see if I get help him
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:21.800]  get that media but you know it's a media zoo here I mean because ever everybody's
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:27.400]  here that the media wants to talk to and so the shows are all you know booked up
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:35.400]  in advance so it's strategically it's probably not the best thing hey but at
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:38.800]  least you get to experience a hurricane how how's the weather is it raining oh
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:45.600]  it's past us now it's you know it's headed up towards it the Gulf you know
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:50.560]  sounds like it looks like New Orleans is gonna be hit the hard again which is you
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:56.280]  know just tragic can you image Obama in there with his joystick controlling the
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:29:01.600]  hurricane it's gonna be interesting if it does hit New Orleans and we've got
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:06.840]  another disaster on our hands you know how quickly he responds remember all the
[01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:14.480]  remember all the the craft they gave the bush or not responding but you know
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:19.040]  that's it is a real management crisis when you have well I wouldn't give Bush
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:22.560]  trouble for the feds not doing a good job that's just to be expected the gun
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:27.120]  confiscation was the issue there yeah oh absolutely stay there let's get into
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:31.400]  Iran let's get into Al Qaeda and then phone calls Joseph Ferris our guest

[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:40.880]  lines of the info war you really should be covering this hurricane more because
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:44.800]  it does look just like Katrina they're they're saying even worse hurricane
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:50.000]  Isaac and I know it was hitting Florida yesterday and now is out in the middle of
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:55.120]  the Gulf of Mexico and it's looks like it's gaining steam not losing it so get
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:58.760]  ready but here's another example of how government can't and won't protect you I
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:02.720]  want to get into the geopolitical with Joseph Farah of worldnet daily.com or
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:06.960]  WND.com but we can play the clips here in fact I know what I'm gonna cover on
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:10.560]  the nightly news tonight it's gun confiscation at Katrina because that's a
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:15.160]  scary thing that they jam the police communications cut down their towers
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:18.960]  because the feds wanted to control it blocked good agencies like the Coast Guard
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:23.480]  even state police and police from other areas thousands of firefighters that
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:27.480]  wanted to help wouldn't let people walk out on the highways made them go to the
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:31.240]  Superdome and then went to some of the most expensive houses in the country
[01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:37.560]  we're talking like $10 million mansions you know classical architecture and I
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:41.120]  guess Georgian style you'd call it you know the big columns the rest of it
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:44.320]  because I have a book on architecture and those houses are actually in there
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:47.640]  and it showed them on the news going in and taking the guns out of their gun
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:52.920]  safes houses with generators houses with rich people in them and the reason I
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:56.640]  raised that is they could argue and make excuses that in some crime-ridden
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:01.080]  areas that well we thought criminals were in this building so we went in to see
[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:04.160]  if there were felons and ran their background and they weren't felons so
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:09.440]  good here's your gun protect yourself but when they made a beeline for the
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:13.840]  rich neighborhoods and looted them and most people never got their guns back
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:19.600]  and that was under Bush and now we have the Army manuals from that time they've
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:23.360]  been training for gun confiscation during emergencies so what do you expect the
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:28.520]  Army to do during an emergency the same training they have for Fallujah it's now
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:32.960]  been declassified is the training for America and Joseph Farah you know just
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:36.840]  like I was on a cruise ship when Katrina came in my first cruise I went on with my
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:45.440]  wife and I had I had one child at the time and we were dumb we didn't know
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:48.320]  you don't go on a cruise and hurricane season but it was real cheap we went and
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:52.800]  on the way back here comes Katrina and it chases us in to Galveston there were
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:57.240]  30-foot waves water coming in the huge ship they had most the decks closed the
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:36:01.440]  staff were all you know scared looking at the television sets and I for a week
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:04.600]  you know felt like I was rocking back and forth trying to get my land legs back
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:11.080]  but I'm ranting here the point is no one knew how big that would be and I
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:16.920]  experienced Katrina well imagine this I mean it's sneaking up on us what do you
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:21.440]  make of what's gonna happen if it does hit that could be turned about as fair
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:26.480]  play if it ruins another big city and then Obama can't respond there you know
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:31.760]  there goes all of their partisan politics over I mean they're still talking about you know pushes
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:37.080]  the family of Katrina and as you point out that a lot of it deserves they don't
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:41.880]  really zero in on the real problem the like gun confiscation but rather you
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:46.560]  know like the federal government is supposed to take care of every problem
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:52.240]  that arises in our country that's the expectation that we all have now but
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:56.480]  yeah as you point out this the this hurricane really hasn't hit the last
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:37:03.080]  landed it was Haiti Miss Cuba didn't hit the coast of Florida and so it's you
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:07.720]  know operating in these warm waters it's headed right if you know if it stayed
[01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:15.280]  on a perfectly straight target right now it would hit New Orleans and you know so
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:21.000]  it potentially is another seven years almost to the day by the way it looks
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:29.080]  like it will hit seven years to the day of Katrina August 29 seven years ago so
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:34.560]  it's kind of spooky I'm sure there's they're preparing evacuations and
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:41.400]  everything right now and you know aren't we lucky to have a great manager in the
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:46.480]  White House like Barack Obama to do it as well I mean since he said that nobody
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:51.560]  built anything in this country but government then I guess he'll be the
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:56.580]  only one like Superman he could fly into the storm and and maybe knock it off
[01:37:56.580 --> 01:38:01.000]  course himself because only government can fix it yeah and what and I want
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:05.160]  everybody to remember that line when when he starts telling you about all
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:11.400]  the things he's achieved over the last four years you know using our money yeah
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:15.920]  and you know all the power of the federal government but he will be claiming
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:21.080]  those as personal achievements but you and I who've actually done things in the
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:26.680]  private sector taking risks built businesses we didn't do that he did
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:30.360]  that of course he probably wouldn't claim credit for anything you were right
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:34.360]  did well I had one of your writers mr. rocker on last week and he made the
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:39.760]  point no mr. president I got myself in the major leagues you didn't and I could
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:45.640]  say right now I got where I met today with my focus my dedication over 17
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:50.520]  years and my listeners supporting me but it's because they shared my views and
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:55.360]  it's very insulting at a fundamental level to have somebody who's only worked
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:59.840]  and lived inside government and had people ghost write his books and hasn't
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:04.240]  worked I guarantee you 18 hours a day like I have many many times the hundreds
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:07.960]  of times it is very irritating to hear that and let me ask you this question
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:11.760]  Joseph Farrell you have a listeners just joined us editor and owner of worldnet
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:16.360]  daily.com I know he has speech writers who write some pretty good speeches for
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:20.520]  teleprompters and he looked like he was on a teleprompter when he gave that
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:23.760]  speech and it turned out he'd given it several times before it got picked up on
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:28.640]  what is the disconnect with the people in his administration to write that or do
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:34.360]  you have any info being in Virginia by DC of who came up with that or do they
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:38.200]  think this country is so communist now that it's time to go ahead and start
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:41.960]  talking like Karl Marx. Yeah I mean I think they're what they're doing is this is
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:47.720]  they're collectivists and they want to implant that collectivist mentality and
[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:51.960]  as many people as they can I think they figure we're at that point right now
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:57.600]  look look at the polls Alex I mean you know right now it's the latest polls show
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:05.440]  and even split between Romney and Obama the only difference between them as you
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:11.480]  point out really is that you know one is more collectivist than the other one
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:17.480]  you know Obama doesn't there's not even a pretense anymore to believing in you
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:23.000]  know free enterprise and that sort of thing a self-government limited
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:27.320]  government and there's a pretense at least on the other side in the
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:32.800]  Republican platform which of course is going to be meaningless once Romney
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:38.320]  elected but I think that's it I mean I think that Obama is what was the old
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:43.480]  thing and you know back in the days of the Soviet Union two steps forward one
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:48.360]  step back I think what's going to happen in this election is we're going to take
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:54.600]  one step back I think and you know what it's for us I believe it's the best
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:41:00.760]  thing even though it may be planned and as I think you're right about the
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:05.760]  globalists have backed off on the support that they gave Obama in 2008
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:11.200]  because he's they perceive probably that he's moving too fast and he's he's
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:18.160]  exhausted whatever you know potential he had to advance their cause he's become
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:23.720]  a liability so let's switch to the guy who's gonna take us one step back but
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:27.760]  we know the power structures made up of different pieces it's not one monolith
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:32.000]  we know the ultra-rich on average our predatory that want to shut down the
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.480]  people they don't control and so that's where the real fights going on here but
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:40.320]  he could stage a big false flag he did fast and furious he could do anything to
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:44.240]  get to pull his bacon out we've had all those Democratic advisors talk about how
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:48.680]  much a terror attack like 9-11 or Oklahoma City would help them they've
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:52.360]  said veterans and libertarians and conservatives are the new enemy we could
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:56.240]  see them kind of framing that in the public's mind preparing the ground or
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:42:00.960]  they could use a big war as a way to get us to rally around the president then
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:05.280]  there are real terror attacks a response by Iran or others or manufactured
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:10.120]  people rally around the commander-in-chief he gets back in uses the war as a
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:14.480]  clampdown mechanism let's move to your sources that right now it looks like the
[01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:20.480]  green lights on yeah I think so and part of it Alex these these politics
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:24.160]  international politics are very complicated Israeli politics are very
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:28.440]  complicated more more even so even then than US politics you know I've spent a
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:35.320]  lot of time there but in Israel today where you rarely have a consensus a
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:42.720]  political consensus among leadership you know the population and so forth there
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:47.800]  is a consensus now have it and keep in mind this is where it comes from 60 years
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:53.600]  ago half the Jewish population of Europe was exterminated they get their own
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:43:00.760]  state and and they now they're faced with a country that is you know developing
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:07.520]  nuclear arms and every single day some mula or some political leader in Iran is
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:12.080]  saying we're going to kill the Jews we're going to this is the this is the
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:17.800]  weapon that we're going to use to destroy the Jewish state and the remnant
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:24.120]  that survived the Holocaust so this is this is bred a consensus in Israel that
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:28.080]  something has to be done the only question is when and that's how it
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:35.080]  affects us because the win has a lot to do with this election if and here's my
[01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:40.920]  take on it right now there it we don't know who's going to win the presidency
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:47.600]  right but they in Israel as if there's a significant chance that they see
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:53.240]  Obama being reelected in 2012 then they're going to roll the dice before
[01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:59.240]  the election they're going to take Iran's nukes out or try to before the
[01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:04.480]  election which means October it really they're going to wait until the last
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:08.040]  minute they're not going to do it in September it's going to happen in October
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:11.680]  so we're we're in the you know they always talk about an October surprise
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:19.200]  this is a very predictable October surprise and it changes the dynamics of
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:24.520]  the election because you know does it does it make people less likely to
[01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:28.880]  throw out throughout an incumbent that they're really not too happy with you
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:35.800]  look at his you know for the approval ratings in their their abysmal but you
[01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:39.280]  change horses in midstream I'm sure there's some people are going to say
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:45.560]  that's not a good idea because if Israel you also have to look at how Israel
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:51.720]  might do this they may use they may use tactical nuclear weapons I mean this is
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:57.600]  I mean you know what that means this is like a major humongous international
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:02.440]  crisis let me ask you this yeah I mean the Defense Department admits many
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:06.920]  nukes are being looked at they've got bunker busters that carry nukes Russia
[01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:14.240]  threatening lining up weapons why why why are the moolahs and the ayatollah
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:18.960]  making statements like we're gonna wipe the Zionists off the map why are they
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:25.000]  doing that when they could back off and not have the war why why are the
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:30.080]  Iranians doing that yes you know it's puzzling because I think there's in
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:36.240]  some ways I think there's a battle going on inside the Iranian camp here
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:43.360]  Iran also feels to an extent that if back is up against the wall you know we
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:47.360]  tend to think of maybe the I think Americans think of the Muslim world they
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:55.440]  don't understand there is not unity in the Muslim world Iran is more fearful
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:46:02.000]  of Saudi Arabia than they are of Israel they hate the Saudi more than they hate
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:07.760]  Israel and you know there's a battle going on inside the Muslim world between
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:13.360]  this essentially between the Shiites and the Sunnis and what they see is there
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:18.160]  this is an accurate view I mean they're right about this the Saudis do a great
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:23.440]  extent control US foreign policy it's just that simple that's right no one ever
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:26.880]  talks about Saudi Arabia I mean obviously Israel's in there manipulating as well
[01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:31.520]  but no one this is when I get major heat if you talk about Saudi power in
[01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:37.040]  media and I mean you name it in politics it is incredible and and that's my
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:43.120]  next point they're openly sending al-Qaeda and jihadis in with NATO backing to
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:49.240]  bring down Libya to bring down Syria Iran sees this and understands their 20% of
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:54.680]  the population Shiite they see the Sunnis taking over backed up by the great
[01:46:54.680 --> 01:47:02.600]  Satan and so here is the United States and NATO allied with al-Qaeda against
[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:08.000]  the Shiites and then Israel's being threatened by Iran and so they want to
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.280]  attack I mean this is like a Mexican standoff it would not be an
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:15.440]  exaggeration to say that the US military has been doing the bidding bidding of
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:22.800]  the Saudis all along and you know when when we're involved in you know Iraq
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:30.180]  and Kuwait and now in Syria you know you say well what are the what are the
[01:47:30.180 --> 01:47:34.800]  national interests the US has in these operations and they're very hard to
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:40.240]  figure out but the Saudi interests are clear and when every president leaves
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:45.640]  office what happens they're all they'll get these you know multi-million dollar
[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:50.880]  endowments from the Saudis it's like you know it's one of the rewards of
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:55.720]  becoming a US president is when you leave office the Saudis take care of
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:58.440]  yeah they pay a million dollars every time you give a speech it's a public
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:04.080]  foreign government payoff but here's my issue I see the Saudi government
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:09.880]  begging Israel to strike Iran and I know Israel bashing is the religion over
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:15.920]  there but why then is Israel playing into that and why is Saudi Arabia how can
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:20.760]  they get away with begging Israel to attack another Muslim country why do
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:26.000]  I mean it's just it's amazing how complex it is and then people you know in
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.680]  the West just want to make it Arabs last parking lot them and you know not
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:36.320]  knowing how diverse it is yeah well what Israel does is it plays its neighbors
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:40.960]  off one another that's how it is managed to you know in addition to having a
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:48.600]  very efficient and strong military it plays one off politics with the folks
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:53.920]  one day you know Hamas is the bad guy and the Palestinian Authority are good
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:58.600]  guys and it switches every once in a while and and that's what they do I
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:03.120]  mean you just go look at a map you know Israel's a little sliver of a country
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:09.400]  surrounded by 300 billion Muslims in the immediate but how is it gonna help
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:13.680]  Israel if they attack Iran and unify Muslims and they get attacked from all
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:17.960]  sides I guess it'll help the politicians to have a big giant war where they can
[01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:22.400]  all be heroes including Obama so Israel's gonna strike and I think it's
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:28.680]  gonna put Obama in the White House well I think that if they do it in October it
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:36.600]  strengthens Obama's hand so if Obama looks like he's even got a very good
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:41.560]  chance of winning the election in November I believe you're gonna see this
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:46.240]  happen in October and the reason for that is because they know that if they
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:52.120]  wait until after the election Obama will not he'll pull the rug out from under
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:56.520]  Israel he can't do that before the election because Israel is popular with
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:50:00.880]  the American people the American people will basically look at it as you know
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:06.720]  this is the country fighting for survival and so he so they think once
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:11.800]  he's the lame duck that he'll put more pressure so it's basically pushing ahead
[01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:16.840]  the timetable so what do you what do you think is gonna happen throughout the
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:20.960]  Middle East right now by the way sure I mean sure I mean it's even coming out
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:23.720]  mainstream news that's basically what's going on and you've got sources as well
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:27.560]  so what's gonna end up happening I mean is it is it leaning towards war is it
[01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:32.360]  leaning away well you know I here I was talking to Jerry Corsi about this we're
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:38.280]  stuck here in our hotel rooms yesterday and it's funny because you know he's he

[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:48.000]  disagreed he doesn't think Israel is gonna attack before the election listen
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:53.360]  you know I hope there's no war I mean I hope things can be resolved without war

[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:39.120]  now that Ron Paul's out of the way the New York Times can report that he had
[01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:44.280]  more than 10,000 people at the alternate convention Paul Fast and Paul never
[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:47.080]  even really promoted that because I guess he wanted to leave things open for
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:51.400]  Rand to get a speaking slot and things and be part of the mainline Republican
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:59.760]  Party. I guess Obama unifies everybody pretty amazing and you can tell the
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:02.920]  establishment doesn't like Ron Paul the way they've treated him for people that
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:06.960]  attack him and say he's establishment they are completely off the reservation I
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:13.200]  want to jam in a few calls from Jerry and from Rob and others here for Joseph
[01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:21.320]  Farah but briefly your take on Ron Paul but let me stop you we didn't have
[01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:25.640]  you faded up go ahead start over so I think Ron Paul has if he's accomplished
[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:33.120]  nothing else has built an amazing foundation for the future for his son
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:40.160]  Rand I think the the possibilities for Rand you know based on the the movement
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:45.080]  that Ron Paul has built are practically limitless this is one of the real I
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:50.920]  think great development over the last eight years is what Ron Paul has
[01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:59.000]  accomplished a real grassroots movement and you know so I mean no you're right
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.120]  I was critical of the enthusiastic endorsement of Romney which I think was
[01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:08.280]  a miscalculation if you want to get just political by Rand but in a way I do see
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:12.560]  them actually winning races against people like Dewhurst and others I
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:17.320]  actually see them getting more constitutionalist in and kind of trying
[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:21.240]  to retake the Tea Party in a way I'm seeing some real success yeah I think
[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:27.480]  that I think Rand is a little more disarming politically that Ron Paul
[01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:34.360]  is you know Ron Paul scares you know even a lot of conservatives with some of his
[01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:43.000]  positions the way he talks but Rand Paul is a little bit more refined and has a
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:48.640]  kind of a quieter approach reasoned approach and you know I don't know
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:54.560]  anybody who doesn't like Rand Paul I mean this is a guy who he so persuasive
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:57:02.480]  he persuades establishment Republicans in the Senate to vote right I think he's
[01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:07.440]  got a tremendously bright future and a lot of it he has to thank his dad for
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:11.720]  yeah absolutely and again they're not perfect but look at look look at the
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:15.400]  alternative Obama who openly says he believes citizens should be able to own
[01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:20.200]  guns when he was a state senator right I mean again I don't believe unless they're
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:25.120]  two evils but when you've got people that are flaming revolutionaries we
[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:28.120]  don't need to get all worked up and energized hating on people that we
[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:31.960]  agree with more we we need to politically get out there and wake people up
[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:35.840]  let's jam in a call one caller who was holding just hung up so let's go to Jerry
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:40.440]  in Illinois you're on the air with Joe Farah Joseph Farah go ahead good
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:43.880]  afternoon both of you Alex and Joe I'm very nice to talk to you first time

[01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:53.000]  open in my eyes my question about the the presidential race this year I don't
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.760]  want to go on both for Mickey Mouse again because we've been given the
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:59.360]  opportunity of voting for the worst of two evils and I have been sick of that
[01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:05.040]  since 2000 and Al Gore and Bush so I mean do you have any ideas did I was
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:09.720]  thinking of a write-in for Ron Paul or Rand Paul anything well you know listen
[01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:15.320]  I'm I'm we're almost on exactly the same page 2000 I couldn't vote for either
[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:23.600]  candidate I announced that publicly it even though you know I I gore was to
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:30.200]  me much worse than than Bush I just didn't what would convince me and I don't
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:35.520]  like mention this before on the air Alex is in 2000 stay there I want to hear
[01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:45.320]  this back in one minute you stay there to Jerry you are listening to GCN visit

[01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:01.360]  what's been going on in this country I don't have to tell you about the power
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:05.160]  grid and just how vulnerable it is that's in the mainstream news every day
[01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:09.040]  millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:13.200]  dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity
[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:17.760]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts and if you
[01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:21.960]  don't have a backup system in place I've got a great opportunity for you right
[01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:26.080]  now our good friends at solutions from science are offering huge savings on
[01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:30.360]  their best-selling power hub unit in fact I think it's the best deal I've

[02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:20.320]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:29.000]  Alex Jones we are now into the third hour we're gonna look at weather
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:32.240]  manipulation and what's really going on with the chemtrail program with a
[02:00:32.240 --> 02:00:37.120]  filmmaker coming up we'll continue with your calls talking to Joseph Farrell
[02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:42.320]  WorldNet Daily you were talking about what what made you make up your mind was
[02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:51.600]  it the 2000 election oh go ahead and inclined to never voting for the lesser
[02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:56.160]  of two evil and there's a distinction between voting for the lesser of two
[02:00:56.160 --> 02:01:00.480]  evils and you know listen there's never gonna be the perfect candidate out
[02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:04.640]  there there's no such thing you know we're all we're all even Alex Jones
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:08.560]  wouldn't be the perfect candidate we find something wrong with Alex Jones we
[02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:12.960]  find something wrong with Farrell I might not even be able to vote for myself but
[02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:19.600]  but in 2000 I met Bush and he was at a very small group he was asked this
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:24.800]  question if a piece of legislation winds up on your desk as president it's
[02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:30.760]  clearly unconstitutional what we do softball question his answer was how
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:38.160]  will I know if it's unconstitutional and that that I mean I was stunned and I
[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:43.760]  said I can't vote for a guy this guy with that position he's through a lawyer
[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:48.440]  flip-flop thing in there constitutionality you know believing in the
[02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:55.640]  Constitution is critical to deserve our support so because he was bad you you
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:02:02.200]  were basically out of it I was out of it and you know but you know in 2004 I
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:09.000]  listened to the Swift boat guys and they got my heart and you know for that
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:14.840]  reason I jumped back in and and supported Bush despite all the terrible
[02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:21.840]  things he's done over the previous four years the principal is there but as we
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:26.200]  talked about the last time I was on your show Alex I think sometimes you have to
[02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:31.840]  vote defensively and this is I'm probably one of those rare occasions where I
[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:37.120]  think it's so important for us to defeat the incumbent who is you know
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:42.880]  marching us into a police state as rapidly as any president we've ever
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:46.360]  seen in our lifetime that's for sure well listen I agree overall what you're
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:51.160]  saying my only issue is he's carrying out the agenda the globalist and we need
[02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:55.600]  to start getting people to vote locally at the state level at 50 60% turnout
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:03:02.400]  you're not 8% turnout you know Washington's not supposed to determine you know what
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:07.800]  we do as a nation as individuals I mean they're supposed to be responsive to us
[02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:12.640]  and the way to get them response responsive to us do exactly what you're
[02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:17.360]  saying the beautiful thing about America is we're not supposed to have a you know
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:21.120]  monolithic federal government that controls our local police department
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:26.480]  that's right no one can deny we don't have a giant all powerful state growing
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:30.000]  and that liberties aren't being burned and that freedoms aren't being destroyed
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:34.520]  and that censorship isn't happening we're going in the wrong direction and we
[02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:40.440]  all of us need to speak up and talk about it and understand a giant army of
[02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:45.480]  snot-nosed collectivist who are dumbered in a box or rocks are coming public
[02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:49.800]  schools are assigning mentors all the kids GPS trackers they're ending the
[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:55.640]  family we are in a giant collectivist globalist to Plandopolis Petri dish and
[02:03:55.640 --> 02:04:01.160]  we have got to revolt against this every day in little ways did that answer
[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:06.000]  your question Jerry in Illinois yes it sure did to a point I mean I'm getting
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:10.240]  sick about voting for Mickey Mouse is to write it you know because it's like
[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:13.280]  we all are you know now listen listen we all are Jerry and I appreciate your
[02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:16.960]  call Jerry I think you should run for local office Jerry you should go speak
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:20.240]  out I mean what we're saying is it isn't all just about the presidential
[02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:24.440]  election I'll be honest I think it becomes a diversion in the final equation
[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:28.120]  and I think we're in deep trouble no matter who gets elected until we wake up
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:32.360]  out of this coma what do you say in final comment on that Joseph exactly what
[02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:38.440]  the advice I wrote back in a book at 2003 taking America back Americans pay
[02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:43.600]  far too much attention to presidential elections of presidential politics and
[02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:48.320]  they're not taking back their own community there's amazing power in your
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:52.600]  community exactly and look Joseph and I are covering the election because most
[02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:56.600]  people are looking at it and you want us to Joseph thank you so much for the
[02:04:56.600 --> 02:05:04.160]  time there he goes he's in Tampa the Silver Lungs generator is the only all

[02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:06.760]  global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the
[02:07:06.760 --> 02:07:10.760]  Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become
[02:07:10.760 --> 02:07:14.560]  more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about perform even gold and
[02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:18.400]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so
[02:07:18.400 --> 02:07:21.960]  our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of

[02:07:55.420 --> 02:08:01.520]  seeds are the ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:28.620]  ease the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:08:28.620 --> 02:08:34.000]  if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv we have the National Weather Service on
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:39.900]  screen with the big hurricane Isaac it'll be making landfall it looks like
[02:08:39.900 --> 02:08:44.860]  the next four or five hours with the main eye making landfall well we'll give
[02:08:44.860 --> 02:08:50.520]  you an update on that coming up in the next segment but it's funny last week
[02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:55.160]  we had filmmaker Michael Murphy but you guys give me a copy of his film thank
[02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:59.780]  you he made what in the world are they spring a few years ago we have that
[02:08:59.780 --> 02:09:05.660]  available at infowarshop.com discounted but now he's made why in the world are
[02:09:05.660 --> 02:09:09.260]  they spring which is really just as important a question well the two go
[02:09:09.260 --> 02:09:15.700]  together we know what they're spring I want to briefly recap that we know why
[02:09:15.700 --> 02:09:19.260]  they're spring and I want to break that down today because this film has the
[02:09:19.260 --> 02:09:24.460]  admissions there's giant secret programs the programs existence is admitted
[02:09:24.460 --> 02:09:36.460]  but the the details are classified and we sit here as a society and think that
[02:09:36.460 --> 02:09:39.820]  we're back on the 1900s or something oh you can't control the weather you know
[02:09:39.820 --> 02:09:43.140]  Joseph Farrell was on earlier and I was making the point of Obama with the
[02:09:43.140 --> 02:09:49.340]  joystick trying to steer it into Tampa all I know is the Stanford Research
[02:09:49.340 --> 02:09:54.060]  Institute and the Department of Energy as well as the Pentagon the Department
[02:09:54.060 --> 02:09:59.060]  of Defense in 1967 this is declassified five years ago six years ago that they
[02:09:59.060 --> 02:10:04.820]  could create hurricanes kill hurricanes strengthen hurricanes weaken
[02:10:04.820 --> 02:10:10.820]  hurricanes and steer hurricanes with old-fashioned aircraft technology men
[02:10:10.820 --> 02:10:14.700]  livings in the father of weather weapons who was what a captain back in
[02:10:14.700 --> 02:10:18.500]  World War two what an amazing individual he's still alive last time I checked
[02:10:18.500 --> 02:10:21.380]  you know it's one of the biggest meteorologists one of the part under one
[02:10:21.380 --> 02:10:25.420]  of the biggest weather modification companies in the U.S. you know where
[02:10:25.420 --> 02:10:28.980]  ski resorts and people pay them to make sure they've got snow you can pay the
[02:10:28.980 --> 02:10:33.500]  Russians to do that the Chinese as well but the point is is that they
[02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:37.820]  declassified it I got him to town I did the interview it's posted hours of it at
[02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:41.780]  prison planet dot TV it's extremely powerful information would been living
[02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:49.140]  still and in that in World War two at the end of it he was flying propeller
[02:10:49.140 --> 02:10:56.580]  aircraft into not hurricanes that's on our hemisphere but into typhoons
[02:10:56.580 --> 02:11:00.620]  typhoons are the same as hurricanes they're just spin the opposite direction
[02:11:00.620 --> 02:11:06.740]  because of the way the earth rotates and they can go up to what 50 miles an
[02:11:06.740 --> 02:11:11.100]  hour faster and the point is is he's the guy that would fly over with squadrons
[02:11:11.100 --> 02:11:15.060]  and flood the Ho Chi Minh trail with 10 feet of water he could take not even a
[02:11:15.060 --> 02:11:19.580]  small cloud and just turn it into a giant storm now they've got these antenna
[02:11:19.580 --> 02:11:23.900]  arrays on the ground beaming up and but countries like Dubai admit they have
[02:11:23.900 --> 02:11:28.020]  this and are turning the desert green but here like we're children they go
[02:11:28.020 --> 02:11:33.140]  fluoride in bed for you kiddies oh GMO is not bad for it there's no world
[02:11:33.140 --> 02:11:37.140]  government and all of this is going on so both films are absolutely essential
[02:11:37.140 --> 02:11:41.380]  and purchasing them at info or shop or info or store.com
[02:11:41.380 --> 02:11:46.340]  funds are operation but both these films are so important and you've got
[02:11:46.340 --> 02:11:49.500]  Geobert Griffin and many others in the first one what in the world are they
[02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:53.060]  spraying now the new one that just came out last week why in the world are they
[02:11:53.060 --> 02:11:57.220]  spraying and they also understand how important this is they put it out free
[02:11:57.220 --> 02:12:01.580]  on YouTube day one just trying to have a future for their families and children
[02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:05.700]  but I suggest you get the high-quality DVD with the expanded extras as well
[02:12:05.700 --> 02:12:11.140]  because that's what this is all about is educating and informing people and
[02:12:11.140 --> 02:12:15.980]  again I I know we've got loaded phones from people earlier we need to go through
[02:12:15.980 --> 02:12:20.580]  them and make sure that our guests are now our guest callers are the most
[02:12:20.580 --> 02:12:23.540]  talk shows we just hang up on you a new guest comes on I like to be nice and I
[02:12:23.540 --> 02:12:27.420]  tend to keeping you on a whole which is kind of mean so I am I'm nice and I'm
[02:12:27.420 --> 02:12:30.660]  bad I apologize we should go through and just get people that have weather
[02:12:30.660 --> 02:12:36.060]  modification questions or people that have been involved open the phone lines
[02:12:36.060 --> 02:12:39.980]  to meteorologist because in these films they've got a lot of meteorologists as
[02:12:39.980 --> 02:12:44.820]  well saying things are going on than aren't normal so the globalist want to
[02:12:44.820 --> 02:12:48.980]  play God because they're in a race with other governments to for whoever can get
[02:12:48.980 --> 02:12:53.420]  the greatest super weapons and most the stuff that the free market created has
[02:12:53.420 --> 02:12:57.260]  been shelved and that's another reason government is so incredibly so
[02:12:57.260 --> 02:13:01.980]  incredibly arrogant right now but but but you look at this hurricane we would
[02:13:01.980 --> 02:13:06.380]  be weird to not say it could be government created as some type of
[02:13:06.380 --> 02:13:10.580]  disaster for the election and maybe Obama's waiting to have a good response
[02:13:10.580 --> 02:13:15.220]  to it that's not outside the realm of possibility you know my gut doesn't
[02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:19.580]  tell me that this is a manufactured hurricane Katrina actually acted like
[02:13:19.580 --> 02:13:22.620]  that the way even meteorologist said it sat there for a couple days it did
[02:13:22.620 --> 02:13:27.260]  nothing and then you know spun over very bizarre but the point is this stuff
[02:13:27.260 --> 02:13:34.380]  exists so we've got to look at that and joining us is filmmaker he is the
[02:13:34.380 --> 02:13:39.820]  director and producer of the new film why in the world are they spring he's the
[02:13:39.820 --> 02:13:44.180]  founder and editor and CEO of Mr. Joseph Farrell Michael Zmurver is a
[02:13:44.180 --> 02:13:47.460]  filmmaker political activist and president of the coalition against
[02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:51.420]  geoengineering his work focuses on the issues that go beyond the interest of
[02:13:51.420 --> 02:13:54.940]  the corporate mainstream media and includes originating and co-producing
[02:13:54.940 --> 02:13:58.380]  the groundbreaking documentary what the world they spring several other short
[02:13:58.380 --> 02:14:01.620]  films that address Kim Trails geoengineering and other controversial
[02:14:01.620 --> 02:14:05.660]  political issues Michael has been also appeared in hundreds of radio interviews
[02:14:05.660 --> 02:14:11.820]  and he joins us right now okay so you join us via Skype with better audio this
[02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:16.780]  time good to have you back recap what in the world they're spraying and then
[02:14:16.780 --> 02:14:20.460]  let's look at why they're doing it just give it to us up front of course all the
[02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:24.620]  interviews and proof are in the film and and what this signifies what from your
[02:14:24.620 --> 02:14:30.700]  research the master plan is well there are a lot of master plans in what in the
[02:14:30.700 --> 02:14:35.420]  world are they spraying we really took an investigative look by in exactly what
[02:14:35.420 --> 02:14:42.420]  specifically was being spray and what we found was the primary ingredients of
[02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:48.420]  geoengineering programs aluminum barium strontium other heavy metals being
[02:14:48.420 --> 02:14:52.660]  found in rain tests from around the world very high quantities in just a
[02:14:52.660 --> 02:14:57.860]  couple years we've seen quantities though as high as 50,000 percent and we
[02:14:57.860 --> 02:15:01.980]  really illustrated in that form both the health implications which are just
[02:15:01.980 --> 02:15:07.100]  unquantifiable and then the ecological implications of these programs and
[02:15:07.100 --> 02:15:12.300]  aluminum oxide is what the primary ingredient is geoengineer state that
[02:15:12.300 --> 02:15:18.420]  that's an effective metal to spray into the sky because they say it is very
[02:15:18.420 --> 02:15:23.460]  active in very light weight in the sky very long but it's very harmful to
[02:15:23.460 --> 02:15:29.300]  humans since really the the increase of these programs we've seen aluminum
[02:15:29.300 --> 02:15:35.260]  related illnesses such as also for the riverside county we've seen over 260
[02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:40.380]  percent increase of just Alzheimer's we now have documented cases of people in
[02:15:40.380 --> 02:15:45.780]  their 40s with dementia in both Alzheimer's barium is very very toxic to
[02:15:45.780 --> 02:15:50.660]  human health when we inhale this it gets into our system and it lowers our
[02:15:50.660 --> 02:15:55.100]  immune system so we can expect to see an increase of illnesses answers other
[02:15:55.100 --> 02:16:00.220]  related no problems and then I've spoken to a number of physicians some
[02:16:00.220 --> 02:16:05.780]  emergency room physicians and during heavy spray days the day the trails go
[02:16:05.780 --> 02:16:09.900]  back and forth and they completely turn our sky into this milky color the
[02:16:09.900 --> 02:16:14.900]  emergency rooms are packed and people complain of your to be headache as you
[02:16:14.900 --> 02:16:21.220]  have burning eyes but they being that barium increases our blood pressure they
[02:16:21.220 --> 02:16:25.900]  stated they expect to see an increase of heart attacks and strokes during these
[02:16:25.900 --> 02:16:31.100]  but the ecological implications Alex are just unquantifiable because again
[02:16:31.100 --> 02:16:35.500]  aluminum oxide and the other primary ingredient and subgeo-engineering
[02:16:35.500 --> 02:16:40.460]  programs this our soils and the scientists in northern California
[02:16:40.460 --> 02:16:45.940]  noticed that the forest were collapsing organic foods were not growing so they
[02:16:45.940 --> 02:16:50.620]  started while investing a bit in initially they did pH changes of the
[02:16:50.620 --> 02:16:55.940]  soil and they found that the pH changes in that area which is typically an area
[02:16:55.940 --> 02:17:01.300]  that has a specific soil change between 10 to 12 times the normal amount of
[02:17:01.300 --> 02:17:07.020]  alkalinity anybody with basic science realizes that when a pH soil the pH of a
[02:17:07.020 --> 02:17:12.860]  soil changes that much you can expect any dye that required soil to grow exactly
[02:17:12.860 --> 02:17:16.620]  what was happening so they began to investigate further and again started
[02:17:16.620 --> 02:17:21.660]  taking rain test and again the primary ingredients of geo-engineering programs
[02:17:21.660 --> 02:17:25.580]  aluminum barium strontium which will change the pH of soil and actually
[02:17:25.580 --> 02:17:29.940]  essentially sterilize our soils are being found everywhere so again these
[02:17:29.940 --> 02:17:34.540]  metals match a number of geo-engineering patents which have literally been designed
[02:17:34.540 --> 02:17:41.260]  to spray these metals out of airplanes they match what geo-engineers deny that
[02:17:41.260 --> 02:17:45.820]  they're spraying state that they gently want you know you're a skype
[02:17:45.820 --> 02:17:49.100]  breaking up maybe on the third interview that'll be the charm but we're gonna try
[02:17:49.100 --> 02:17:51.740]  to keep going through this with you right now you may want to shut down any
[02:17:51.740 --> 02:17:56.180]  any programs that are running in the background here with the filmmaker this
[02:17:56.180 --> 02:18:01.580]  couldn't be a more important subject it couldn't be a more important area to
[02:18:01.580 --> 02:18:06.380]  understand because I mean I was making a chemtrail film before you guys made
[02:18:06.380 --> 02:18:09.860]  yours that's why I'm glad you made yours because I was so busy I never got around
[02:18:09.860 --> 02:18:16.860]  to it but expanding on this there's hundreds of patents and there's all
[02:18:16.860 --> 02:18:21.060]  these different agencies doing it and and and they admit it's going on they
[02:18:21.060 --> 02:18:25.100]  just are classifying the specifics and they're trying to dominate the weather
[02:18:25.100 --> 02:18:31.500]  while manipulating our soils at the same time yeah exactly and weather control
[02:18:31.500 --> 02:18:35.700]  is is a very effective tool to consolidate an enormous amount of both
[02:18:35.700 --> 02:18:39.580]  monetary and political power into the hands of a few and if we go with
[02:18:39.580 --> 02:18:44.620]  geo-engineers stating they want to do this for as they state it's to mitigate
[02:18:44.620 --> 02:18:50.220]  global warming so dispersing aerosols into our sky will block the sun and you
[02:18:50.220 --> 02:18:54.340]  know we looked into that and yes dispersing aerosols into our sky will
[02:18:54.340 --> 02:18:58.140]  reflect the sunlight so regionally temporarily it will create cooling but
[02:18:58.140 --> 02:19:02.460]  we have found a number of studies university studies a couple of studies
[02:19:02.460 --> 02:19:06.740]  by NASA not that I'm a big NASA fan or believe everything that NASA puts out
[02:19:06.740 --> 02:19:11.460]  but these studies indicate putting aerosols will again temporarily
[02:19:11.460 --> 02:19:16.540]  regionally but those aerosols act as a blanket at night and trap heat and Alex
[02:19:16.540 --> 02:19:20.740]  in the past 10 to 15 years when these programs have really ramped up we've
[02:19:20.740 --> 02:19:24.780]  seen a great increase in nighttime high so the question really that we've been
[02:19:24.780 --> 02:19:29.060]  asked is why is this going on a lot of people you know we connected a lot of
[02:19:29.060 --> 02:19:35.180]  dots and in the first film so we've got emails hundreds of them every day and
[02:19:35.180 --> 02:19:41.400]  and the answer isn't so simple our agenda can be fulfilled by putting
[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:45.660]  aerosols into our sky but weather control seems to be the number one
[02:19:45.660 --> 02:19:49.980]  agenda we met with the first interview was actually with former 20-year weather
[02:19:49.980 --> 02:19:55.300]  man Scott Stevens and he explained to us how the aerosols work in conjunction
[02:19:55.300 --> 02:19:58.580]  with the storms but what really led us in that direction stay there I want to
[02:19:58.580 --> 02:20:01.500]  hear about that when we get back
[02:20:01.860 --> 02:20:06.380]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts get off the grid and
[02:20:06.380 --> 02:20:10.060]  generate your own supply of electrical power folks with what's been going on in
[02:20:10.060 --> 02:20:12.780]  this country I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how
[02:20:12.780 --> 02:20:17.060]  vulnerable it is that's in the mainstream news every day millions of people have
[02:20:17.060 --> 02:20:20.820]  lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer
[02:20:20.820 --> 02:20:25.300]  heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity I've always said that every
[02:20:25.300 --> 02:20:29.180]  family needs to be ready for blackouts and if you don't have a backup system
[02:20:29.180 --> 02:20:33.020]  in place I've got a great opportunity for you right now our good friends at
[02:20:33.020 --> 02:20:37.620]  Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling power hub

[02:24:23.020 --> 02:24:27.460]  bigger subject we know they put chemicals in our water GMO designed to
[02:24:27.460 --> 02:24:30.860]  sterilize us in our food that's in all the major studies well they're also
[02:24:30.860 --> 02:24:34.140]  manipulating the weather and Aaron's actually got it a big file we did a
[02:24:34.140 --> 02:24:39.380]  special report on what was it 1992 a scientist won a Nobel Prize for spraying
[02:24:39.380 --> 02:24:43.540]  aluminum to oxide the atmosphere to manipulate things NASA says the years
[02:24:43.540 --> 02:24:50.300]  between 22 and 31% darker especially over the industrialized world with the
[02:24:50.300 --> 02:24:54.060]  trails but they say oh the ice crystals are doing it okay well when I was a
[02:24:54.060 --> 02:24:59.700]  child you watch the trail go by you watch it dissipate in 30 seconds to a
[02:24:59.700 --> 02:25:05.460]  minute now I watch him sit there for hours and create a haze and people say
[02:25:05.460 --> 02:25:09.220]  well it's special spray planes doing it well we know government corporations
[02:25:09.220 --> 02:25:13.260]  have those and we know that's going on they've been government programs with
[02:25:13.260 --> 02:25:17.220]  helicopters spraying you know white blood cells on cities I mean there's been
[02:25:17.220 --> 02:25:20.700]  all sorts of crazy stuff admitted releasing stuff in the New York subway
[02:25:20.700 --> 02:25:25.340]  that's in the New York Times you know radiating foster kids shooting people up
[02:25:25.340 --> 02:25:30.380]  with syphilis and we know secret testing is is the byword of this
[02:25:30.380 --> 02:25:35.980]  scientific elite this is this this mad scientist cabal that runs the New World
[02:25:35.980 --> 02:25:40.540]  Order and it's slowly ending the natural order and creating this planed
[02:25:40.540 --> 02:25:48.780]  opolis nightmare eugenics based system but how are they having regular jets
[02:25:48.780 --> 02:25:55.740]  because I'll see jets at the same level even in hot weather leaving compensation
[02:25:55.740 --> 02:25:59.860]  trails but then I'll see one at the same level not and then I find the patents
[02:25:59.860 --> 02:26:03.460]  where they add it to the jet fuel so the companies don't even know and the
[02:26:03.460 --> 02:26:07.740]  patent is where the aluminum dioxide in the kerosene the jet fuel is aerosolized
[02:26:07.740 --> 02:26:14.100]  by the by the jet engine to where perfect compartmentalization I mean most
[02:26:14.100 --> 02:26:16.700]  cities that put fluoride in the water there they really believe it's good for
[02:26:16.700 --> 02:26:23.740]  your teeth they don't know it's admitted a chemical weapon so from your
[02:26:23.740 --> 02:26:30.100]  research how many different companies and groups are knowingly involved in this
[02:26:30.100 --> 02:26:34.700]  versus compartmentalized well we we haven't gotten too much in into who and
[02:26:34.700 --> 02:26:39.860]  that's gonna be the basis for for my next film but Alex there are a number of
[02:26:39.860 --> 02:26:45.580]  companies that benefit net that are most likely involved of course Monsanto is
[02:26:45.580 --> 02:26:49.540]  involved in if you control the weather you can literally consolidate an
[02:26:49.540 --> 02:26:54.380]  enormous amount of monetary political power into the hands of a few and we'll
[02:26:54.380 --> 02:26:58.540]  get into that and it's precisely what the film was about what we're saying
[02:26:58.540 --> 02:27:04.220]  before the break what we noticed about 500-2000 miles ahead of a storm that's
[02:27:04.220 --> 02:27:07.740]  the days where you see the intense trailing planes going back and forth
[02:27:07.740 --> 02:27:12.380]  back and forth and in the sky turns into a very milky color so we went to
[02:27:12.380 --> 02:27:16.700]  interview 20-year weatherman Scott Stevens and he explained to us some of
[02:27:16.700 --> 02:27:21.660]  the science behind some of this and it's very simple science to control the
[02:27:21.660 --> 02:27:25.660]  weather if you look at the main ingredient in geoengineering programs in
[02:27:25.660 --> 02:27:30.620]  what we're finding and rain tests around the world now it's aluminum aluminum is
[02:27:30.620 --> 02:27:35.500]  a very effective conductor in in our sky so what they are able to do when they
[02:27:35.500 --> 02:27:40.540]  put up this heavy canopy of aerosol aluminum through the use of of
[02:27:40.540 --> 02:27:45.300]  harp technology or other technology they literally have the ability to heat up
[02:27:45.300 --> 02:27:49.900]  our ionosphere or other parts of our atmosphere and when when that heats up it
[02:27:49.900 --> 02:27:53.980]  actually creates a lift and in that lifting of the atmosphere it creates a
[02:27:53.980 --> 02:27:58.980]  low pressure vacuum and they have the ability to literally steer storms into
[02:27:58.980 --> 02:28:03.540]  certain regions or in the case of this summer here in the United States out of
[02:28:03.540 --> 02:28:07.300]  certain regions and if you look back at some of the science and geoengineers are
[02:28:07.300 --> 02:28:12.660]  very open about the way that their aerosols react with water molecules and
[02:28:12.660 --> 02:28:17.220]  I went to an aerosol research conference spoke with them many professors they
[02:28:17.220 --> 02:28:20.380]  all told me the same thing that geoengineering could be used to control
[02:28:20.380 --> 02:28:24.660]  our weather so when they put those aerosols into our sky normal evaporation
[02:28:24.660 --> 02:28:29.220]  that should occur does not and we'll explain that in a second but these
[02:28:29.220 --> 02:28:33.540]  these particles act as what's called cloud condensation nuclei so when the
[02:28:33.540 --> 02:28:38.460]  water evaporates naturally it should connect with other water molecules
[02:28:38.460 --> 02:28:42.140]  eventually condensing and falling as rain they are not doing that they
[02:28:42.140 --> 02:28:46.380]  connect with this with these fine metal particulates and they drift and that's
[02:28:46.380 --> 02:28:50.020]  one of the main reasons why here in California we're having drought
[02:28:50.020 --> 02:28:53.580]  conditions because the water that should be falling here drifts over the
[02:28:53.580 --> 02:28:57.460]  continental divide but it eventually has to fall and that's the reason we're
[02:28:57.460 --> 02:29:01.340]  getting the intense flooding in the Midwest now a real important part of
[02:29:01.340 --> 02:29:05.580]  this drought that we're seeing there's no question that this summer we have an
[02:29:05.580 --> 02:29:08.980]  engineered drought and many people thought they quit spraying because you
[02:29:08.980 --> 02:29:13.740]  look over California over the land we haven't had very few visible trails but
[02:29:13.740 --> 02:29:18.620]  we looked at satellites off of the Pacific and from the equator all the way
[02:29:18.620 --> 02:29:23.540]  up to Alaska heavy trailing not any sun getting through to the water so this is
[02:29:23.540 --> 02:29:27.900]  creating the drought in this capacity that's right the last 16 17 years since
[02:29:27.900 --> 02:29:32.500]  this really started in earnest they've just been beta testing now they're
[02:29:32.500 --> 02:29:37.900]  getting it tweaked down and as the State Department random says they'll use
[02:29:37.900 --> 02:29:43.140]  food as a weapon they'll use weather as a weapon owning the weather 2025 Pentagon
[02:29:43.140 --> 02:29:47.300]  document if they'll pay 22 billion to ship General Motors out of the country
[02:29:47.300 --> 02:29:52.740]  they'll pay billions to shut our farms down we're on the March the Empire's on
[02:29:52.740 --> 02:30:02.420]  the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network the worst drought in 50 years
[02:30:02.420 --> 02:30:06.220]  continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half-year on
[02:30:06.220 --> 02:30:11.140]  record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn of
[02:30:11.140 --> 02:30:15.940]  soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost
[02:30:15.940 --> 02:30:19.540]  to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up

[02:33:45.220 --> 02:33:49.140]  here a minute I can't help it in all the ugliness in this world there's still the
[02:33:49.140 --> 02:33:53.700]  human mind that produces stuff like this crank it up
[02:34:01.220 --> 02:34:09.300]  man that's ecstasy right there am I wrong guys here's that awesome pure
[02:34:09.300 --> 02:34:20.500]  awesomeness or as the TSA would say even more awesome we're gonna be going back
[02:34:20.500 --> 02:34:24.020]  to our guest and your calls I promise here in just a moment I briefly wanted
[02:34:24.020 --> 02:34:28.660]  to remind everybody we are listeners supported so we buy books videos t-shirts
[02:34:28.660 --> 02:34:35.860]  ball caps we got my favorite camouflage ones back in it supports the
[02:34:35.860 --> 02:34:40.020]  broadcast I am hiring six new reporters four of them are now here the other two
[02:34:40.020 --> 02:34:45.060]  are coming soon I'm hiring more video people more camera people more equipment
[02:34:45.060 --> 02:34:52.420]  I just leased another space so we can have more studios I'm all in here because
[02:34:52.420 --> 02:34:55.820]  we are reaching a lot of people doesn't mean I do the best job in the world but
[02:34:55.820 --> 02:35:00.660]  you know what I'm the most effective just because I took action and I want to
[02:35:00.660 --> 02:35:05.020]  thank all you for your support and I tend to plug the info wars health
[02:35:05.020 --> 02:35:09.980]  products we can get to the longevity stuff discounted when I'm taking them
[02:35:09.980 --> 02:35:18.660]  because here I am right now drinking a polymers plus and my essential fatty
[02:35:18.660 --> 02:35:22.820]  acids that they have the best proprietary blend of a fish oil with the
[02:35:22.820 --> 02:35:28.060]  key plant oils to help optimize your cholesterol and something young Javi
[02:35:28.060 --> 02:35:32.100]  doesn't have they have a great seaweed but I like the might of Phalan that we

[02:36:05.380 --> 02:36:10.540]  was a short segment continuing with the filmmaker the director and producer of
[02:36:10.540 --> 02:36:15.100]  why in the world are they spraying you were getting into this drought being
[02:36:15.100 --> 02:36:20.740]  engineered and Al Gore has said pay him money for carbon and and magically Gaia
[02:36:20.740 --> 02:36:25.940]  will make it be wet again and the Mississippi won't run dry give us your
[02:36:25.940 --> 02:36:29.940]  research your evidence the scientists you talked to in the film for this summer's
[02:36:29.940 --> 02:36:35.180]  drought being engineered yeah well again these these particulates act as cloud
[02:36:35.180 --> 02:36:41.660]  condensation nuclei so this summer again we are seeing the entire Pacific from
[02:36:41.660 --> 02:36:47.820]  the equator all the way up to Alaska sprayed and to get moisture where we
[02:36:47.820 --> 02:36:53.820]  depend on sunshine hitting that Pacific in clouds condensing so with this this
[02:36:53.820 --> 02:36:58.500]  artificial coverage we are not getting much evaporation but the clouds that do
[02:36:58.500 --> 02:37:03.460]  evaporate now are attaching to the the metal particulate that's being sprayed
[02:37:03.460 --> 02:37:07.860]  and instead of that rain falling it drifts Alex I did spend about three
[02:37:07.860 --> 02:37:13.460]  weeks this summer after Barry Kulski and I finished producing the film and of
[02:37:13.460 --> 02:37:16.500]  course the crops are just being devastated there everything was
[02:37:16.500 --> 02:37:20.460]  extremely dry what I did notice though when rain was in the forecast we would
[02:37:20.460 --> 02:37:25.460]  see these big beautiful cumulus underheads developing and then boom we'd
[02:37:25.460 --> 02:37:29.460]  see the plane spraying back and forth back and forth literally putting an
[02:37:29.460 --> 02:37:34.700]  aerosol canopy over the storms and within about 45 minutes no no no no I've
[02:37:34.700 --> 02:37:39.300]  watched it in Texas where it's not planes landing at the airport they fly in
[02:37:39.300 --> 02:37:44.220]  and head in front of the front and kill it they kill the storm it falls apart and
[02:37:44.220 --> 02:37:48.060]  that moist your drift so without question but you know the first time I
[02:37:48.060 --> 02:37:51.620]  heard about this and when once we started investigating I said why in the
[02:37:51.620 --> 02:37:57.460]  world would anybody want to control the weather and we began finding monetary
[02:37:57.460 --> 02:38:01.780]  like G Edward Griffin said in the first oh there's the Chicago mercantile the
[02:38:01.780 --> 02:38:05.620]  same one that has the carbon tax they've now got a controlling the weather and
[02:38:05.620 --> 02:38:09.860]  predicting it fund that's right so people now are betting on the weather and
[02:38:09.860 --> 02:38:14.500]  what we found Mike Agni who is a trader at the Chicago mercantile exchange use
[02:38:14.500 --> 02:38:18.180]  the example is this third through the use of weather derivatives with many
[02:38:18.180 --> 02:38:24.260]  corporations actually used to offset the risk due to adverse weather so they
[02:38:24.260 --> 02:38:27.660]  can essentially bet on and for adverse weather conditions so if you have a
[02:38:27.660 --> 02:38:32.460]  crop let's say worth five million dollars in the Midwest but you ensure it
[02:38:32.460 --> 02:38:36.180]  through the use of these derivative derivatives for ten million dollars you
[02:38:36.180 --> 02:38:43.100]  have in in a financial advantage if the crop fails so what we're seeing and what
[02:38:43.100 --> 02:38:47.780]  I found out every every commodity is driven by the ability to predict
[02:38:47.780 --> 02:38:52.380]  weather and I'm not saying every trader who's trading these derivatives is in
[02:38:52.380 --> 02:38:57.500]  on this but the people who are in cahoots the multinational corporations who
[02:38:57.500 --> 02:39:02.700]  were aware of the drought agenda this summer literally are making billions of
[02:39:02.700 --> 02:39:07.860]  dollars off of this this drought that we have and then we found out it goes much
[02:39:07.860 --> 02:39:12.740]  deeper to financial now we see that natural systems are being destroyed of
[02:39:12.740 --> 02:39:16.780]  course we have the Hegelian dialectic problem reaction solution which I hope
[02:39:16.780 --> 02:39:21.700]  we'll get into in this interview but without question there is a financial
[02:39:21.700 --> 02:39:25.700]  agenda behind these damaging programs and some people are making billions of
[02:39:25.700 --> 02:39:30.140]  dollars at the expense of literally Alex every living thing on the planet so
[02:39:30.140 --> 02:39:34.260]  this is really really serious some of the consequences of geoengineering and
[02:39:34.260 --> 02:39:39.060]  ozone depletion we now have a huge ozone hole over the northern hemisphere
[02:39:39.060 --> 02:39:44.180]  drought conditions we now have most of the world if you look at the global
[02:39:44.180 --> 02:39:49.660]  drought monitor most of the world is in drought offset rain patterns and geo
[02:39:49.660 --> 02:39:53.460]  engineers are very open about this they state if we start these programs this is
[02:39:53.460 --> 02:39:57.420]  what we'll see and what was most concerning to me was the statement that
[02:39:57.420 --> 02:40:01.460]  one of the the people at the geoengineering conference made he stated
[02:40:01.460 --> 02:40:05.780]  these programs if they start them which they obviously have could disrupt the
[02:40:05.780 --> 02:40:12.740]  food supply of over two billion people and we have the globalist saying they
[02:40:12.740 --> 02:40:17.100]  want to cut the food off in the memorandums like 200 State Department to
[02:40:17.100 --> 02:40:25.620]  make us starve basically there's a documentary that was voiced by William
[02:40:25.620 --> 02:40:30.540]  Shatner called Trinity and it shows that a world nuclear testing and the US did
[02:40:30.540 --> 02:40:35.500]  more than anybody can buy more than the Russians the French the the you name it
[02:40:35.500 --> 02:40:41.540]  combined the British combined and got Trinity and beyond I think if you're
[02:40:41.540 --> 02:40:47.100]  correcting me CJ and in it it shows over a hundred tests firing high-powered
[02:40:47.100 --> 02:40:53.380]  hydrogen missiles hydrogen bombs into the upper atmosphere and it shows old
[02:40:53.380 --> 02:40:58.300]  news clips and they go we're trying to blow a hole in the atmosphere to see of
[02:40:58.300 --> 02:41:03.500]  the atmosphere will off gas into space and I'm going they tried to destroy our
[02:41:03.500 --> 02:41:08.900]  atmosphere and it shows one night they detonate 20 plus high-power hydrogen
[02:41:08.900 --> 02:41:12.260]  bombs and they don't do much from clouds the atmosphere there's these big
[02:41:12.260 --> 02:41:17.180]  giant white balls and then next we're going to try to blow up the Van Allen
[02:41:17.180 --> 02:41:22.380]  radiation belt so they fire missiles into that it's like these it's mad
[02:41:22.380 --> 02:41:29.100]  scientists mad scientists are in control and and they're they're jacking with
[02:41:29.100 --> 02:41:34.980]  everything and by the way you say you know they say if they did this it would
[02:41:34.980 --> 02:41:39.540]  happen they Bill Gates was just dumping stuff over New Mexico last month they've
[02:41:39.540 --> 02:41:44.420]  got all sorts of testing this has been admittedly going on it's not like this
[02:41:44.420 --> 02:41:48.820]  isn't admitted because you keep adding the proviso of yeah they said this at
[02:41:48.820 --> 02:41:52.780]  this conference I mean they've got tens of thousands of admitted tests they've
[02:41:52.780 --> 02:41:56.780]  done go ahead and it right now they're selling this to the public so they're
[02:41:56.780 --> 02:42:00.500]  using the fear of global warming stating you know again there are some very
[02:42:00.500 --> 02:42:04.300]  serious consequences it's going to destroy the ozone layer all of these
[02:42:04.300 --> 02:42:08.340]  consequences which by the way now are happening but they say we are going to
[02:42:08.340 --> 02:42:12.300]  have to do this for the greater good of humanity because if we don't do it
[02:42:12.300 --> 02:42:17.660]  everyone's going to die Alex this is about money and power and what we're
[02:42:17.660 --> 02:42:24.500]  finding again we interviewed Barb Barb Peterson of Farm Wars and she alerted us
[02:42:24.500 --> 02:42:28.580]  to some things that are happening to the farms across the US even in Maui
[02:42:28.580 --> 02:42:35.420]  we're seeing ecosystems collapse in natural organic foods are dying this is
[02:42:35.420 --> 02:42:38.580]  not to speculate sure that's what I wanted to raise for you all in the last
[02:42:38.580 --> 02:42:41.980]  two films you talked to countless scientists they test the soil but even
[02:42:41.980 --> 02:42:46.460]  mainline studies say all this stuff's going up people call me everywhere but
[02:42:46.460 --> 02:42:49.300]  I mean I talked to old timers there aren't as many birds there aren't as
[02:42:49.300 --> 02:42:55.900]  many bugs on the west coast the trees are dying what's going on well this this
[02:42:55.900 --> 02:42:59.700]  is an attack on life itself and and the reason and what I found out living in
[02:42:59.700 --> 02:43:04.620]  Hawaii where where I go after I'm in LA we live on an organic farm we're
[02:43:04.620 --> 02:43:09.980]  dependent on natural sun natural seeds in rain you know natural systems this is
[02:43:09.980 --> 02:43:13.860]  literally what every prophecy has been talking about this big oppressive system
[02:43:13.860 --> 02:43:17.940]  and I'll tell you what they do through death and destruction of these programs
[02:43:17.940 --> 02:43:22.180]  they create what's called abiotic stress abiotic stress is everything that
[02:43:22.180 --> 02:43:27.660]  geoengineering creates is heavy metal contamination in our soil it's it's
[02:43:27.660 --> 02:43:32.260]  drought it's too much moisture and it's fungal overgrowth which is very deadly
[02:43:32.260 --> 02:43:38.020]  to two crops geoengineering programs proliferate fungal overgrowth so again
[02:43:38.020 --> 02:43:42.660]  they create this abiotic stress which by the way the EPA states that by the year
[02:43:42.660 --> 02:43:49.380]  2030 we will see 50% more crop loss due to to abiotic stress and there is a
[02:43:49.380 --> 02:43:54.900]  company Alex and I'm sure you have heard of them that has patented a genetically
[02:43:54.900 --> 02:44:00.660]  modified seed to address this abiotic stress in that company is Monsanto so
[02:44:00.660 --> 02:44:04.940]  through the death and destruction of natural systems they come in with the
[02:44:04.940 --> 02:44:09.140]  solution to this program and historically farmers after they planted a
[02:44:09.140 --> 02:44:12.340]  crop at the end of the season they would get their seeds use some of those
[02:44:12.340 --> 02:44:15.820]  seeds for the next season many of these seeds are what are called terminator
[02:44:15.820 --> 02:44:19.980]  seeds and they will not regenerate so that makes the farmer dependent year
[02:44:19.980 --> 02:44:24.980]  after year after year going to this company of course we've seen a
[02:44:24.980 --> 02:44:30.100]  sterilization studies that indicate a lot of other health implications with
[02:44:30.100 --> 02:44:34.660]  genetically modified seeds and again they sterilize our soil so the farmers
[02:44:34.660 --> 02:44:38.220]  that we interviewed for why in the world are they spraying one had seen a 60%
[02:44:38.220 --> 02:44:43.140]  decline in their ability to grow natural organic foods in the past ten
[02:44:43.140 --> 02:44:47.260]  years since they've seen an increase of the aerosol trails from chemtrail
[02:44:47.260 --> 02:44:52.180]  programs the other had seen a 70% decline in their ability to get yield so
[02:44:52.180 --> 02:44:56.020]  again this I know I've talked to farmers and people that I know that do
[02:44:56.020 --> 02:45:00.460]  truck farming for their whole lives and they say they keep thinking it's a bad
[02:45:00.460 --> 02:45:04.780]  year but it goes on for decades where where the weather is just never the way
[02:45:04.780 --> 02:45:08.140]  it's been and it's all screwed up and the media is like well yeah you're not
[02:45:08.140 --> 02:45:11.860]  paying money the government for carbon dioxide you know carbon dioxide is not
[02:45:11.860 --> 02:45:16.020]  natural it's evil but I mean we and then you learn we're in a carbon dioxide
[02:45:16.020 --> 02:45:20.340]  starved environment compared to when it's been it's almost like the leaders
[02:45:20.340 --> 02:45:24.980]  are space aliens who are terraforming the planet to their atmosphere like they
[02:45:24.980 --> 02:45:28.980]  live or something I mean I'm not saying I really believe that but that's almost
[02:45:28.980 --> 02:45:33.580]  becoming plausible for how destructive and psychopathic the people running
[02:45:33.580 --> 02:45:40.380]  things are and then again they admit I mean they had a 19 what 78 UN treaty that
[02:45:40.380 --> 02:45:43.780]  we signed on to to not do weather manipulation but then they tell the
[02:45:43.780 --> 02:45:49.260]  public oh it doesn't exist I mean it's just crazy we're living in a matrix well
[02:45:49.260 --> 02:45:53.500]  that treaty was the n-mod treaty and Dr. Nick baggage who is in why in the world
[02:45:53.500 --> 02:45:58.660]  how they sprayed spraying explained an exemption countries can use this the
[02:45:58.660 --> 02:46:03.940]  exception was this countries can use this technology over their own soil Scott
[02:46:03.940 --> 02:46:07.340]  Stevens even Nick spoke to us about controlling the weather you can
[02:46:07.340 --> 02:46:11.620]  literally control weather thousands of miles away by putting aerosols into one
[02:46:11.620 --> 02:46:15.780]  area of the earth actually manipulating the jet stream and having the the
[02:46:15.780 --> 02:46:20.420]  affected outcome of what you desire again thousands of miles away so when
[02:46:20.420 --> 02:46:24.140]  you manipulate weather it doesn't get to that the border of the US and say oh you
[02:46:24.140 --> 02:46:27.980]  know I can't go any further because there's an n-mod treaty so that appears
[02:46:27.980 --> 02:46:32.460]  to be the loophole in this about the genetic modification this is again
[02:46:32.460 --> 02:46:37.140]  genetically modifying every natural system including for us we now have a
[02:46:37.140 --> 02:46:41.140]  company called Arbogen which is genetically modifying for us what this
[02:46:41.140 --> 02:46:46.820]  is Alex when when I go back to Hawaii we grow our food naturally we are not
[02:46:46.820 --> 02:46:51.100]  dependent on the corporation because we're dependent on nature this is an
[02:46:51.100 --> 02:46:55.980]  attack on nature and through the death and destruction of natural systems these
[02:46:55.980 --> 02:47:00.580]  corporations literally usurp the authority of nature or the authority of
[02:47:00.580 --> 02:47:05.180]  God and bring it under corporate authority so that it can be controlled by
[02:47:05.180 --> 02:47:08.740]  these corporations which are controlled by these entities and that's what this
[02:47:08.740 --> 02:47:13.340]  is again every major religion has spoken about this and we are the ones that
[02:47:13.340 --> 02:47:16.700]  have been called to address this Alex I'll tell you why we still have natural
[02:47:16.700 --> 02:47:20.780]  systems but they are dying very quickly we are still getting no no no it's a
[02:47:20.780 --> 02:47:24.260]  monopoly they're gonna make it where the earth can't naturally live and we can't
[02:47:24.260 --> 02:47:27.700]  naturally produce that's their plan then we have to go get a genetically
[02:47:27.700 --> 02:47:34.100]  engineered baby or crops to live it is a total monopoly takeover by the eugenicist
[02:47:34.100 --> 02:47:39.260]  and it's all there the reason we never made our film going back four or five
[02:47:39.260 --> 02:47:44.980]  years ago it was we just year after year compiled rooms of documents and proof to
[02:47:44.980 --> 02:47:51.820]  where we couldn't even present it all it's so nightmare go ahead sorry for
[02:47:51.820 --> 02:47:57.220]  cutting off it's almost like we're living in a sci-fi movie Alex these these
[02:47:57.220 --> 02:48:00.740]  elitists these I like to call them any different things which we shouldn't say
[02:48:00.740 --> 02:48:05.220]  on air they want to be the source of life so through death and destruction they
[02:48:05.220 --> 02:48:09.420]  are disaster capitalists and again they have this godlike power and that's why
[02:48:09.420 --> 02:48:14.260]  we're seeing these really ridiculous things so you know we we this issue goes
[02:48:14.260 --> 02:48:19.940]  so deep we Barry and I could have made a film that was literally 20 hours long in
[02:48:19.940 --> 02:48:23.780]  addressing many different components we decided to go with weather control a
[02:48:23.780 --> 02:48:27.860]  because it appears to be the number one agenda but it also outlines the basic
[02:48:27.860 --> 02:48:32.540]  principles of these programs which again is to draw destroy natural systems so
[02:48:32.540 --> 02:48:36.660]  that these corporate unbelievable but if everybody see things that are so big
[02:48:36.660 --> 02:48:40.100]  and so horrible tend to just keep going on because no one can believe it's
[02:48:40.100 --> 02:48:43.740]  happening but if everybody saw your film if everybody out there got an issue
[02:48:43.740 --> 02:48:47.300]  going in their local area enough people within the system are gonna be able to
[02:48:47.300 --> 02:48:51.700]  turn this around we've got to force this out into a public debate five years
[02:48:51.700 --> 02:48:55.380]  ago you talk about this and get laughed at now the White House science are comes
[02:48:55.380 --> 02:48:59.780]  out and admits they're looking at doing it and always pushing it like it's a
[02:48:59.780 --> 02:49:04.620]  good thing PR wise because they know we're waking up to them let's go to phone
[02:49:04.620 --> 02:49:11.020]  calls for our guest let's go ahead and talk to Lisa in California who's
[02:49:11.020 --> 02:49:17.940]  listening on 13 20 a.m. KOMY go ahead Lisa you're on the air yeah I wanted to
[02:49:17.940 --> 02:49:25.100]  call attention to what is a wet subatomic electrical metal mist like
[02:49:25.100 --> 02:49:29.900]  attract light we have all these metal particulates and of course we have
[02:49:29.900 --> 02:49:35.220]  poison in our bodies too and then if you see the earth in outer space it is in
[02:49:35.220 --> 02:49:41.780]  case in a I feel agenda 21 also wants to encapsulate us in a grid of electricity
[02:49:41.780 --> 02:49:45.500]  that goes on a subatomic level throughout our bodies all the time
[02:49:45.500 --> 02:49:50.060]  increased maybe by a cell phone well no the globalist admit they're doing
[02:49:50.060 --> 02:49:54.620]  electromagnetic in fact Dr. Begge always points out there's ten times literally
[02:49:54.620 --> 02:49:58.020]  more patents on electromagnetic manipulation than for chemical
[02:49:58.020 --> 02:50:04.900]  manipulation that is going on DARPA admits it the details remain classified
[02:50:04.900 --> 02:50:13.060]  yeah I'm I'm actually the daughter of a dead NSA consultant analyst who was
[02:50:13.060 --> 02:50:22.380]  the head to the governor of California when I was born interesting gone no no

[02:54:03.360 --> 02:54:33.040]  folks it sounds over the top to say there's all this weather modification going on but so much of it is publicly admitted and declassified just like I've been telling you forever sodium fluoride's killing you dead or no hammer and now they just admit it in mainstream news but no one stops them and it is a
[02:54:33.040 --> 02:55:02.040]  incredibly wicked program and plan we're talking to the maker of the new film that we carry info or shop.com discounted the free citizen rollbook if you get it there is the director and producer Michael J Murphy why in the world are they spring he also made what in the world are they spring and we're going back to your phone calls right now Rob in North Carolina what is your take on all this
[02:55:02.040 --> 02:55:29.040]  well I got two things I can ask you a question after we're done with the weather sure Alex I actually live in North Carolina we're about 3500 feet up in the air we're in the mountains and I've got a 12 kilowatt solar system at the house and we actually I don't you know I when I first heard about Kim child like that kind of crazies on him but
[02:55:29.040 --> 02:55:43.040]  I see him up above and it kind of creates like a quilt pattern and actually when that happens the generation off the panel is about 25% less so it actually affects.
[02:55:43.040 --> 02:56:05.040]  NASA and again not that we just trust NASA other governments and groups a decade ago the earth was 20 something percent darker now it's 30% darker guys type in earth now 30% darker just into the search engine and show people no no the earth is darker right about the percentage you said I mean this is so big look when I was a kid I lived in Dallas
[02:56:05.040 --> 02:56:14.040]  I lived in Dallas until I was about six years old and the trails disappeared I lived outside Dallas with the airport.
[02:56:14.040 --> 02:56:23.040]  Plains didn't leave trails except in the winter they were ice crystals they dissipated in minutes they don't dissipate many of them.
[02:56:23.040 --> 02:56:36.040]  The earth is 20% darker says expert but I've got numbers of over 30% comments on that Mr. Murphy absolutely documented global dimming as well will be a good search to use for that very well documented.
[02:56:36.040 --> 02:56:49.040]  I even know it has has done a report about a year and a half ago that showed a significant increase in stratospheric aerosol and they admitted they said condensation trails are doing it.
[02:56:49.040 --> 02:57:00.040]  Well they they say for the trails correct in Dane way but they didn't say it was a chem trail they say oh the normal ice crystals are doing it really why did an ice crystal change from when I was 20 till now.
[02:57:00.040 --> 02:57:12.040]  And they failed to document in that study a the source of the aerosols they are talking about that the trails dimming but for the specific aerosols that we're talking about another study.
[02:57:12.040 --> 02:57:23.040]  They did not source the where the the aerosols were coming from or the content of that we know what the content is from rain test of the primary ingredient in geoengineering programs.
[02:57:23.040 --> 02:57:38.040]  But Dane Wiggington who is a solar expert came into this issue about six years ago when he began to notice he has the largest solar powered home in northern California he started getting 60 to 70% declines in the solar power.
[02:57:38.040 --> 02:57:49.040]  And he said what is going on he went outside exactly I'm gonna have to hold you over stay there I want to finish with a caller folks I don't just get up here and say something no matter how crazy it sounds just to say it to have fun.
[02:57:49.040 --> 02:58:01.040]  I said because it's backed up the solar companies as he mentioned are coming out and saying something's going on this is so big it's like in the matrix cartoon they made a matrix cartoon.
[02:58:01.040 --> 02:58:09.040]  In the last episode the government blacks out the sky to kill the the robots that operate off solar.
[02:58:09.040 --> 02:58:13.040]  So the robots just grab humans and use them as the heat source now I'm not saying that's real.
[02:58:13.040 --> 02:58:20.040]  I'm saying they're throwing all this in our faces and it's so big.
[02:58:20.040 --> 02:58:27.040]  The earth is over 30% darker now and they admit in the government studies that trails are doing it.
[02:58:27.040 --> 02:58:32.040]  Ladies and gentlemen this is so big call a real fast what was your other question.
[02:58:32.040 --> 02:58:37.040]  I wanted to ask you or talk to you about this before we had a dedicated.
[02:58:37.040 --> 02:58:42.040]  Hold on we got to just get the question and hold on.

[03:00:23.040 --> 03:00:34.040]  Music playing.
[03:00:34.040 --> 03:00:43.040]  All right real fast going back to Rob Rob 30 second question hit me with the question hit me I want to get a few other colors here.
[03:00:43.040 --> 03:00:50.040]  All right the Federal Reserve had a charter back in 1913 for 100 years obviously we're coming up on that yes big deal.
[03:00:50.040 --> 03:00:53.040]  Yeah no big deal or is it no I'm saying it's a big deal.
[03:00:53.040 --> 03:01:00.040]  Okay and then the other one was how that might say into the there's a I guess the United States with bankrupt in 1933.
[03:01:00.040 --> 03:01:07.040]  Literally bankrupt by design yeah they they and they're organizing us into a new bankruptcy to rape us even more.
[03:01:07.040 --> 03:01:18.040]  Yeah I'm just kind of wondering I mean obviously we're coming up on the 100 year charter and I've seen stories both ways but I'm just kind of it just seems to me kind of odd that the whole financial systems kind of cave in and.
[03:01:18.040 --> 03:01:21.040]  And guess what there's there's 100 years coming up so.
[03:01:21.040 --> 03:01:30.040]  No absolutely no it's an admitted organized collapse by design to bring us into this point we're in now the globalist all admit that.
[03:01:30.040 --> 03:01:43.040]  In fact the John B Wells had a guest on who's written a book about the organized collapse who I want to get on the show he had a big show Saturday with four guests meant to give you that to the producer I want to get that guest he had on.
[03:01:43.040 --> 03:01:54.040]  Let's take another call now here for our guest who's been holding the longest here bill in Georgia got a question for the maker of why in the world are they spring.
[03:01:54.040 --> 03:01:58.040]  Hey Alex how you doing today pretty good my friend.
[03:01:58.040 --> 03:02:21.040]  Yeah I'm a retired Navy chief 20 years of service retired with an honorable discharge and I'll tell you what between you and YouTube I have woken up amazingly and looking up in the sky and seeing the Kim trails on a daily basis is really kicking me off.
[03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:34.040]  I have yeah there's a whole shadow system operating like like like like there are another species or something under the national security umbrella that's not national security at all.
[03:02:34.040 --> 03:02:41.040]  Exactly and I was in a compartmentalized environment my entire 20 year career.
[03:02:41.040 --> 03:02:56.040]  And I had blinders on for my entire 20 year career I went from my mother's womb to the industrialized school system straight into the military and had blinders on my entire life.
[03:02:56.040 --> 03:03:06.040]  And the next thing I know I get out of the military and I'm starting to wake up and it was you and YouTube that helped wake me up.
[03:03:06.040 --> 03:03:12.040]  That's an amazing story we should do a whole show about people's awakenings just about their awakenings.
[03:03:12.040 --> 03:03:18.040]  Let me ask you this even though it's frightening another truth now do you not feel more alive than you did before.
[03:03:18.040 --> 03:03:30.040]  Yes sir without a doubt do I consider myself a micro farmer now I've started a garden I've got chickens I've got goats I'm trying to self sustain myself.
[03:03:30.040 --> 03:03:40.040]  And the problem is I can't self sustain myself if they're putting beryllium oxide and aluminum oxide on my plants and all my animals.
[03:03:40.040 --> 03:03:52.040]  What a beautiful call absolutely you know to hear you about your awakening and now you're trying to get ready and like our guest was saying the solar our caller calls in and says my solar panels don't get as much when they're doing this.
[03:03:52.040 --> 03:04:05.040]  And then officially we've got solar panel experts saying up to 60% thank you so much sir for the call final comments on that Michael J. Murphy maker of why in the world are they spring.
[03:04:05.040 --> 03:04:18.040]  Well we are seeing pilots now waking up to this issue but you know I notice when I'm up in the air it's very difficult to see the trails because you're level with them so when we're on the ground it's much more profound to be able to identify.
[03:04:18.040 --> 03:04:36.040]  And again pilots are waking up around the world but I do encourage people to start gardens to live independently from the system however you know Alex like like your website prison planet anybody who so to speak escapes and gets off of the plantation by growing their own food and becoming independent.
[03:04:36.040 --> 03:04:50.040]  This is an attack on that they're literally trying to make it impossible to grow off of nature and essentially worship God they want us worshiping the beast what is the beast I call the beast is governmental corporate conglomerate.
[03:04:50.040 --> 03:05:08.040]  That's right they want you in their fake plastic city where the whole world looks like in all the glittering lights and things of Times Square they want your soul very well said my friend.
