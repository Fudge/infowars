[00:00.000 --> 00:16.680]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:16.680 --> 00:31.760]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones many are now
[00:31.760 --> 00:37.360]  awakened to the harsh reality of depopulation and democide which we
[00:37.360 --> 00:43.440]  find ourselves in today and the endgame is out in the open to destroy humanity
[00:43.440 --> 00:50.360]  under the guise of transhumanism what we've unfortunately learned is that
[00:50.360 --> 00:54.840]  there is an overwhelming herd of us who will do whatever they are told by the
[00:54.840 --> 01:01.640]  system which explains how we've gotten this far there are seemingly millions
[01:01.640 --> 01:07.080]  who will believe whatever pop culture tells them including the mass denial of
[01:07.080 --> 01:12.320]  natural health and immunity while attempting to criminalize a knowledge
[01:12.320 --> 01:17.720]  base spanning millennia corporate pop culture prostitutes spew talking
[01:17.720 --> 01:24.240]  points for big pharma's mrna mystery cocktail as the only solution and if
[01:24.240 --> 01:28.720]  the solution is less people which is what the elitists have been saying for
[01:28.720 --> 01:34.480]  decades then they are succeeding multiple studies conducted in the uk show
[01:34.480 --> 01:39.320]  that after the vaccine was introduced covid deaths increased by over a
[01:39.320 --> 01:44.880]  thousand percent and more than half of all covid deaths and hospitalizations
[01:44.880 --> 01:50.640]  are from the fully vaccinated the numbers in new york city are showing the
[01:50.640 --> 01:58.000]  same experts in the field including the inventor of the mrna tech being used
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.720]  have been warning of this since the beginning but silenced by the corporate
[02:02.720 --> 02:09.520]  media project veritas has recently exposed how doctors and nurses are well
[02:09.520 --> 02:15.720]  aware of the dangerous mrna jabs but care more about their own jobs and how
[02:15.720 --> 02:22.120]  even low-level big pharma employees care only about the numbers it is an all-out
[02:22.120 --> 02:27.520]  attack against the human race we knew this a year ago because we know their
[02:27.520 --> 02:33.320]  white papers which is why we know what comes next brought to you by the same
[02:33.320 --> 02:39.480]  characters behind the mrna vaccines what comes next is the end of natural
[02:39.480 --> 02:47.080]  organic humanity and the beginning of man's own version man fused with machine
[02:47.080 --> 02:53.720]  in a lab the end there is no more hiding the endgame it's out in the open
[02:53.720 --> 02:59.960]  where only the unbrainwashed can see it ultimately it will be up to the people
[02:59.960 --> 03:05.160]  the police in australia are loyally serving their globalist masters what
[03:05.160 --> 03:09.560]  makes you think anything will be different in america a flight surgeon for
[03:09.560 --> 03:15.880]  the u.s. army has warned that all vaccinated pilots are unfit to fly the
[03:15.880 --> 03:20.880]  u.s. military is being destroyed from within the only way through to freedom
[03:20.880 --> 03:27.600]  is for the people to say no which is now starting to happen all across the world
[03:27.600 --> 03:33.560]  humanity uniting together as the human race standing up against the most
[03:33.560 --> 03:39.440]  sophisticated tyranny that mankind has ever faced all while the pop culture
[03:39.440 --> 03:45.880]  media machine ignores it a worldwide peaceful revolution of the people is a
[03:45.880 --> 03:52.080]  numbers game so continuing to wake people up is our road to liberation do
[03:52.080 --> 03:57.760]  not remain silent during this dire time at the crossroads of human history it is
[03:57.760 --> 04:18.360]  the truth that shall set us free free in fours dot com this is greg rees
[04:18.360 --> 04:29.720]  and it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say I don't know what's
[04:29.720 --> 04:33.640]  going to happen at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you
[04:33.640 --> 04:43.640]  got one from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[04:43.640 --> 04:51.360]  ladies and gentlemen it's friday october 1st 2021 and the embattled info wars
[04:51.360 --> 04:58.440]  operation goes into overdrive on the other side of this 60-second break so
[04:58.440 --> 05:04.640]  the placebo that they have used that the FDA has allowed them to use has often
[05:04.640 --> 05:09.720]  been another vaccine a vaccine with a known adverse reaction profile that's
[05:09.720 --> 05:16.000]  causing death and damage in its own right that it's the aluminum as an
[05:16.000 --> 05:20.520]  adjuvant in the vaccine a known neurotoxin a known immunotoxin a known
[05:20.520 --> 05:25.440]  poison in human beings that is in the supposedly inert placebo totally
[05:25.440 --> 05:31.680]  inappropriate this is not good science it is not science at all it is an effort
[05:31.680 --> 05:36.360]  to cover up the true adverse reaction rates to these vaccines so that they can
[05:36.360 --> 05:42.280]  get through the low barrier of constraints put there by the FDA and on to
[05:42.280 --> 05:47.120]  the market that is the only concern dr. wakefield is just one of many informed

[06:52.280 --> 06:59.080]  and so awake then I got home and got to talk to another good person I know Joe

[07:15.200 --> 07:20.000]  done as well and we've buried the hatchet and a lot of their stuff I won't
[07:20.000 --> 07:23.920]  get into on air at this point but people now know that I didn't make any of this
[07:23.920 --> 07:28.400]  stuff up and then I've meant well always and had about a 98% accuracy rate and so
[07:28.400 --> 07:32.400]  the fact that info wars is being so widely accepted across the board now
[07:32.400 --> 07:35.760]  really shows that we've got a fighting chance because we have been the top of
[07:35.760 --> 07:39.600]  the spear and that's all because of you keeping us on air that's all because of
[07:39.600 --> 07:43.160]  your prayers it's all because of your financial support you are the info war
[07:43.160 --> 07:48.600]  that's when you call in and say thank you thank you thank you Alex look I don't
[07:48.600 --> 07:54.240]  mind the thanks I appreciate it but you are the resistance and I salute you and
[07:54.240 --> 07:58.240]  I thank you now I've got more energy than I've ever had because the fight so
[07:58.240 --> 08:02.880]  intense and so serious and I just got to be careful like a thousand horsepower
[08:02.880 --> 08:07.080]  NASCAR not to blow my engine and all of us have to do that together as well and
[08:07.080 --> 08:12.400]  just let God be our northern star be our guiding light what a time to be alive
[08:12.400 --> 08:19.920]  let me tell you what's coming up today incredible hearings yesterday on the
[08:19.920 --> 08:24.560]  Supreme Court ruling on abortion and states rights and the most bizarre
[08:24.560 --> 08:31.920]  horrifying if it wasn't so sick and be hilarious statements about abortion
[08:31.920 --> 08:40.760]  Democrat Congress people saying quote act of love as they protest abortion law
[08:40.760 --> 08:45.560]  they say killing babies in the womb is an act of love so we're gonna be getting
[08:45.560 --> 08:50.760]  to all of those clips coming up next segment we have again every day I come
[08:50.760 --> 08:55.440]  on air it's a bigger day than the previous day with the COVID-19 martial
[08:55.440 --> 09:00.840]  law takeover we've got all that news Congress the judicial branch the
[09:00.840 --> 09:06.960]  White House staff the CDC the FDA the USPS NIAID Pfizer and Moderna are all
[09:06.960 --> 09:12.680]  exempt from forced inoculations but they want to make you be forced to take it
[09:12.680 --> 09:16.720]  and Feinstein introduces bill to require COVID vaccine in order to fly
[09:16.720 --> 09:20.360]  domestically but she's exempt I mean you talk about discrimination oh meanwhile
[09:20.360 --> 09:26.360]  Pfizer launches final study for COVID drug that's suspiciously similar to Ivor
[09:26.360 --> 09:31.120]  Mectin they're just changing the molecule a little and saying oh the new pill you'll
[09:31.120 --> 09:40.760]  take daily stop COVID is Ivor Mectin yep wow absolutely incredible isn't it
[09:40.760 --> 09:46.440]  we're gonna be getting to all of that they also just approved they also just
[09:46.440 --> 09:52.200]  approved a another horse medicine steroid for humans for COVID now there's
[09:52.200 --> 10:01.200]  the headline on drudge a drug that can cut your risk of COVID death in half but
[10:01.200 --> 10:06.600]  they've been fighting so hard to keep us from getting the Ivor Mectin it isn't
[10:06.600 --> 10:11.200]  just about money they want to be able to kill us they've got new viruses that
[10:11.200 --> 10:14.080]  you know I were making won't work on they're about to roll out I'm gonna lay
[10:14.080 --> 10:18.080]  all that out today because it's the horrible future we face if we don't
[10:18.080 --> 10:23.400]  stand up and say no and then we've got more on the Marine Corps Lieutenant
[10:23.400 --> 10:30.080]  Colonel highly decorated held without being charged in a prison in a brig in a
[10:30.080 --> 10:37.960]  military stockade now for six days and that ties in with Politico coming out
[10:37.960 --> 10:43.280]  on MSNBC and defending that the FBI basically ran the provocateur operation
[10:43.280 --> 10:48.560]  on January 6th and the Green Beret that didn't go in the building who's been on
[10:48.560 --> 10:53.720]  our show who recorded the FBI trying to get him to be an informant he has now
[10:53.720 --> 10:59.120]  been SWAT teamed for a misdemeanor of trespassing on the capital grounds and
[10:59.120 --> 11:03.720]  they SWAT teamed his whole house searched his house searched his travel
[11:03.720 --> 11:07.280]  trailer searched his shed took a bunch of stuff and threw him in jail for a
[11:07.280 --> 11:11.080]  misdemeanor well at least they've charged him with something unlike the Green
[11:11.080 --> 11:17.600]  Beret you know of you know past I guess when they're being held in North
[11:17.600 --> 11:21.400]  Vietnamese prison camps but that's really what the January 6 people still
[11:21.400 --> 11:25.720]  being held in solitary confinement many of them are basically living under to the
[11:25.720 --> 11:30.400]  point of even authoritarians in Belarus can point at America now when we
[11:30.400 --> 11:33.360]  criticize them for authoritarianism and say you're worse than us it's just
[11:33.360 --> 11:38.400]  incredible and that ties into something I'm gonna cover because it's so
[11:38.400 --> 11:41.280]  interesting not because I'm in the middle of it because I got plenty of
[11:41.280 --> 11:44.760]  news we're in that's that I'm not gonna get to this is boring it's just your
[11:44.760 --> 11:50.120]  pure popping cock but did you know the Democrats across the country are getting
[11:50.120 --> 11:55.160]  rid of the jury trial and that judges are announcing beyond the kangaroo court
[11:55.160 --> 11:59.360]  the old Aussie joke was supposed to have a jury trial but the judge would put you
[11:59.360 --> 12:03.200]  know nine or 12 kangaroos in there and then say it that they voted against you
[12:03.200 --> 12:09.800]  that they convicted you in Austin the judge in our Sandy Hook case the other
[12:09.800 --> 12:13.920]  one retired we've been on appeal in the anti-slap thing for a couple years and
[12:13.920 --> 12:18.440]  the COVID shut things down for a year and her second hearing with us defaulted
[12:18.440 --> 12:22.680]  us and said you are guilty you owe money these families for your speech and you
[12:22.680 --> 12:27.880]  don't get a jury trial I'm gonna decide the money so and even the Huffington
[12:27.880 --> 12:33.280]  Post said this is really a theory no one's ever done it like this only if
[12:33.280 --> 12:39.280]  somebody like is being sued or whatever and they don't challenge the case or
[12:39.280 --> 12:42.840]  don't go to court or never even show up or leave the country then you can get a
[12:42.840 --> 12:46.480]  default if they can still show evidence that's not what this is we gave them
[12:46.480 --> 12:49.600]  more info than anybody ever would was about my statements on air was all your
[12:49.600 --> 12:53.520]  bank accounts and all your emails and yeah I mean just literally hundreds of
[12:53.520 --> 12:56.480]  thousands of pieces of material and they would always say you've given us
[12:56.480 --> 13:01.120]  nothing and the media would say that and that's why I said a month ago I said
[13:01.120 --> 13:04.560]  they just want a default in both Connecticut and Texas in my view because
[13:04.560 --> 13:07.560]  they don't want me to actually put people on the stand who I've never said
[13:07.560 --> 13:10.480]  their names you're under Texas law you can't sue somebody for defamation you
[13:10.480 --> 13:16.320]  haven't said their name that's in the Texas law it's on the law but Democrats
[13:16.320 --> 13:20.640]  don't care they go ahead with this is the same Democrats that indicted Governor
[13:20.640 --> 13:26.640]  Rick Perry when the county attorney was drunk spitting on police attacking them
[13:26.640 --> 13:30.480]  and then she ran the state ethics board a $25 million a year deal from the state
[13:30.480 --> 13:34.720]  legislature to fund an anti-corruption board and Perry just said fire her off
[13:34.720 --> 13:40.160]  that as the head of it or I'll veto your money he vetoed it and they indicted him
[13:40.160 --> 13:44.720]  yeah there's CNN by the way that's something I'm proud of man last night
[13:44.720 --> 13:48.200]  after this came out I went to the CNN website and there I was right at the top
[13:48.200 --> 13:51.880]  I mean that's like John Hancock sign the signature big on the Declaration of
[13:51.880 --> 13:55.960]  Independence I mean those enemies of America the globalist are just up there
[13:55.960 --> 14:02.240]  saying he's guilty the judge says because he never gave him any info and these
[14:02.240 --> 14:09.120]  judges would order me they'd say give us your secret marketing on Sandy Hook we
[14:09.120 --> 14:12.440]  say we didn't market Sandy we barely talked about it but our news isn't
[14:12.440 --> 14:17.360]  marketing products we sell we tell you about them that's the marketing and in
[14:17.360 --> 14:20.960]  Connecticut when we turned over we said well here's our marketing for sheets for
[14:20.960 --> 14:25.640]  ad reads they said that's not that you tried to give us your Sandy Hook marketing
[14:25.640 --> 14:29.560]  is another marketing you're hiding it so so it's very cough to ask where you're
[14:29.560 --> 14:34.520]  supposed to produce something that doesn't exist because all these judges in
[14:34.520 --> 14:38.480]  my view want is browning points for the media which is a dead dying dinosaur
[14:38.480 --> 14:43.360]  system so go ahead and cling to that like a insect in fall as the winter comes
[14:43.360 --> 14:48.320]  or the leaves trying to cling you know to their branches when the winter comes
[14:48.320 --> 14:51.880]  those political systems are going down they're going away they're going to the
[14:51.880 --> 14:57.280]  ground if they're politically dying and we're seeing the last gasp of this whole
[14:57.280 --> 15:00.840]  globalist system with the COVID lockdowns and the medical martial law and the rest
[15:00.840 --> 15:05.000]  of it and it's just all part of the course of where we are so I grieve for
[15:05.000 --> 15:10.600]  the nation but this is what I expected to happen help Owen's been charged with
[15:10.600 --> 15:13.280]  attacking the capital to even go in the capital trying to put him in jail for
[15:13.280 --> 15:17.320]  years people that were just at the capital peacefully they're protesting
[15:17.320 --> 15:21.120]  outside the capital are being swatting by the FBI Marine Corps Lieutenant
[15:21.120 --> 15:25.200]  colonels that say you know this is designed to collapse Afghanistan this is
[15:25.200 --> 15:29.080]  wrong his problem was he wasn't painting swastikas on the walls and blaming
[15:29.080 --> 15:33.720]  somebody for it it wasn't false flagging so we're in good company here to be
[15:33.720 --> 15:37.600]  persecuted by these people and again this is beyond kangaroo court I mean
[15:37.600 --> 15:43.480]  there's not even kangaroos on the jury there's just no jury so Alex Jones today
[15:43.480 --> 15:46.880]  you tomorrow and this is what's happening all over the country they've
[15:46.880 --> 15:51.280]  weaponized the judiciary the Democratic Party has a Republican sit there and
[15:51.280 --> 15:57.040]  just suck their thumbs and do nothing we'll be right back on Alex Jones if
[15:57.040 --> 16:00.440]  you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of

[16:04.720 --> 16:09.720]  year here's why we now have a small number of solar generators back in stock

[19:03.440 --> 19:08.440]  their allegiance to the new world order and democrat politicians have an
[19:08.440 --> 19:14.200]  announcing it here as well that means allegiance to a tyrannical world corporate
[19:14.200 --> 19:18.080]  government established by the Rockefellers through the UN and they
[19:18.080 --> 19:21.920]  want inside your bodies to put in you what they want when they want and to
[19:21.920 --> 19:27.840]  have the global digital tracking covid passes or vaccine passes to form the
[19:27.840 --> 19:33.160]  backbone of their new world ID and now their puppet body has announced the
[19:33.160 --> 19:36.920]  force inoculation of a hundred million americans to keep their jobs in total
[19:36.920 --> 19:41.920]  violation of the Nuremberg code this is criminal and he's lying saying it's an
[19:41.920 --> 19:46.160]  approved vaccine when they did not approve it they say that's a 20-25 maybe
[19:46.160 --> 19:49.760]  they just expanded the emergency authorization that's why the two top
[19:49.760 --> 19:54.040]  scientists quit a week and a half ago well you live to see an absolute new
[19:54.040 --> 19:59.440]  world order world government if you submit they will totally enslave you
[19:59.440 --> 20:06.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:06.120 --> 20:31.440]  so by increment not just the united states the whole world has gone under
[20:31.440 --> 20:35.600]  corporate global governance and global governance has traditionally been
[20:35.600 --> 20:39.560]  opposed by liberals people who believe in low taxes the right to defend
[20:39.560 --> 20:43.840]  themselves family rights less government liberal means more freedom in the
[20:43.840 --> 20:49.440]  classical a 1776 sense so they became the liberals with their leftist
[20:49.440 --> 20:54.480]  ideology that has nothing to do with the liberal ideology and they now control
[20:54.480 --> 20:59.640]  language to a great extent they've done them dumb the public down to a massive
[20:59.640 --> 21:06.360]  extent in fact I even have biden's education secretary cardona saying quote
[21:06.360 --> 21:10.600]  parents should not be the primary stakeholders in their children's
[21:10.600 --> 21:18.600]  education these are real quotes I have the video fact I'm gonna play it in a
[21:18.600 --> 21:22.640]  moment where we're gonna play biden's education secretary first and then that
[21:22.640 --> 21:29.600]  ties in to just countless other clips biden's nominee for top bank regulator
[21:29.600 --> 21:37.880]  earned linen award praise ussr's equality and wants to end banking as we
[21:37.880 --> 21:40.680]  know it and that's what the big mega banks want where we live in her
[21:40.680 --> 21:47.440]  communism they live offshore exempt from it meanwhile aOC suggests she was
[21:47.440 --> 21:52.120]  raped she says I speak about this as a survivor she also cried when Israel
[21:52.120 --> 21:58.760]  got funding for an iron dome that shoots down offensive missiles I mean just
[21:58.760 --> 22:03.280]  she's also cried in an empty field with a fence up around it saying there were
[22:03.280 --> 22:07.960]  children bringing out of toilets on the other side I mean it's just one line
[22:07.960 --> 22:16.320]  after another but next segment I'm gonna get to all of these articles and these
[22:16.320 --> 22:21.720]  video clips I've got that are just next level I mean I don't even hate
[22:21.720 --> 22:26.520]  Democrats and liberals anymore they're like spoiled rotten three-year-olds with
[22:26.520 --> 22:32.560]  power that just lie incessantly and are gaslighting us saying the most
[22:32.560 --> 22:38.000]  ridiculous things you can imagine remember during the Democrat debates what
[22:38.000 --> 22:41.320]  a clown show it was where they were all debating about you know who could say
[22:41.320 --> 22:47.880]  the most ridiculous thing like I think it's very important to get transgender
[22:47.880 --> 22:57.600]  women abortions he said men who become women abortions and their straight face
[22:57.600 --> 23:04.320]  saying we give condoms to the women in the California correctional facilities so
[23:04.320 --> 23:11.520]  they can have sex with other women so they can become pregnant and they just
[23:11.520 --> 23:15.440]  sit here and gaslight us and they passed the law that if they want to they can
[23:15.440 --> 23:20.560]  put you in jail for disagreeing with that I mean this is a cult of freaks
[23:20.560 --> 23:26.040]  because if they can get you to accept that you'll accept anything so that's all
[23:26.040 --> 23:29.120]  coming up next time let's go ahead and play this clip here's Biden's education
[23:29.120 --> 23:32.240]  secretary and of course you see this in headlines and mainstream news like
[23:32.240 --> 23:35.880]  parents are a problem it's time to rethink parents being in charge of the
[23:35.880 --> 23:39.360]  children it's time for the state to be in charge I mean these are classic
[23:39.360 --> 23:46.200]  bonafide 100% tyrannical platforms in history we know they're bad we know
[23:46.200 --> 23:49.200]  they're horrible we know they destroy productivity and freedom I mean it's
[23:49.200 --> 23:53.880]  like hey is brain cancer good probably not hey a shooting yourself in the
[23:53.880 --> 23:58.600]  head of the shotgun fun probably not good is having the state run children
[23:58.600 --> 24:02.880]  and take over full society and force injections on us but they're exempt is
[24:02.880 --> 24:08.640]  that a good idea no that's animal farm for real but the average leftist is so
[24:08.640 --> 24:14.160]  uneducated and dumb down like what's an animal farm you say I want a farm no it's
[24:14.160 --> 24:19.000]  the story of animal farm George Arwell another one of his masterpieces so here's
[24:19.000 --> 24:22.920]  just one of the clips here it is fairly quick answers here because I want to get
[24:22.920 --> 24:27.680]  to secretary Becerra do you think parents should be in charge of their
[24:27.680 --> 24:33.400]  child's education as the primary stakeholder I believe parents are
[24:33.400 --> 24:37.600]  important stakeholders but I also primary educators have a role in
[24:37.600 --> 24:41.280]  determining educational programming I think that's gonna be a little
[24:41.280 --> 24:45.600]  out of focus what I think you're gonna find across all elements of education
[24:45.600 --> 24:49.360]  since they pay the bills they raise the kids they probably need to be the
[24:49.360 --> 24:58.360]  primary spokespeople for their own kids good education probably need that he
[24:58.360 --> 25:04.120]  needs to be fired here's the quotes Biden's nominee for top bank regulator
[25:04.120 --> 25:10.360]  earned linen award praise USSR's equality and wants to end banking as we know it
[25:10.360 --> 25:14.200]  which is exactly what the IMF and World Bank and Claus Schwab want bankrupt
[25:14.200 --> 25:17.480]  everything give you enough money to barely live but you have to live in
[25:17.480 --> 25:21.840]  these new corporate dormitories that totally control every fetus of your
[25:21.840 --> 25:25.400]  life and she talks about you know when she immigrated here from a communist
[25:25.400 --> 25:28.920]  country that she doesn't like America and wants to make it communist you need to
[25:28.920 --> 25:33.600]  go read the quotes here well why the hell did you come here then oh because you
[25:33.600 --> 25:37.560]  want to be a manager in the communist takeover you're not gonna be in the
[25:37.560 --> 25:42.120]  gulag like all the rest of us once they collapse the society in the economy
[25:42.120 --> 25:45.840]  where they're gonna shield us in place why are we all going to a camp oh so
[25:45.840 --> 25:49.760]  you'll be safe from the unvaccinated oh they're the ones I've got to go to a
[25:49.760 --> 25:55.080]  camp oh who are the unvaccinated this is a popular sign that's totally true that
[25:55.080 --> 25:58.640]  a lot of people are taking out the demonstrations I think I'm gonna make a
[25:58.640 --> 26:04.540]  t-shirt call the hypocrisy tour 2021 at the top and then say exempt from
[26:04.540 --> 26:09.480]  Biden's vaccine mandates Congress legislative branch their staff all of
[26:09.480 --> 26:16.040]  them judicial branch the judges White House staff CDC employees FDA
[26:16.040 --> 26:24.000]  employees USPS employees niad employees Pfizer employees Moderna employees because
[26:24.000 --> 26:27.880]  they need to be a working unit while the rest of us are poisoned and died then
[26:27.880 --> 26:30.720]  they'll extract the money out of us I mean imagine a world like that but see
[26:30.720 --> 26:35.200]  oh we're all being lectured about how Apple gave a hundred million to Black
[26:35.200 --> 26:39.040]  Lives Matter so they're allowed to run Chinese slave camps they're allowed to
[26:39.040 --> 26:42.320]  spy on you and crack what you do because they're the good liberals I mean
[26:42.320 --> 26:47.880]  Tim Cook wears turtlenecks and he's gay so because he gets in a bed with men
[26:47.880 --> 26:51.800]  he's allowed to have suicide nets around his factories because again he's
[26:51.800 --> 26:57.400]  curating Alex Jones off the internet but he gets to be there he's the good man
[26:57.400 --> 27:01.480]  just like the New York Times lying about WMDs on purpose and all the evil things
[27:01.480 --> 27:07.120]  that oh but I questioned one of the big events they hyped up because of a lot
[27:07.120 --> 27:10.920]  of the anomalies and I have a right to question that in fact I for a while
[27:10.920 --> 27:14.380]  thought it didn't happen then I thought it probably did and now seeing how
[27:14.380 --> 27:18.160]  synthetic everything is maybe my original instinct maybe Alex Jones is
[27:18.160 --> 27:24.160]  always right I'm pretty much right 9% of the time folks and so are you I mean we
[27:24.160 --> 27:28.840]  all know this is easy to look at to see what's happening and what did I say six
[27:28.840 --> 27:34.120]  months ago I said they're gonna come out with another version of hydroxychloroquine
[27:34.120 --> 27:37.840]  now they have and they're coming out the new version of the base of the same
[27:37.840 --> 27:42.240]  molecule of ivermectin Pfizer launches final study for COVID drug that's
[27:42.240 --> 27:48.960]  suspiciously similar to horse paste big article on info wars.com for zero
[27:48.960 --> 27:54.200]  edge.com be sure and check that out for yourself also globalist big tech
[27:54.200 --> 27:57.800]  continues assault on truth and people's livelihoods that's yesterday the
[27:57.800 --> 28:01.360]  war room at a great point that was a great broadcast that's all coming up but
[28:01.360 --> 28:07.840]  first Howard Stern's following talking points and and I understand that because
[28:07.840 --> 28:10.480]  I hear the same talking points on every channel they admittedly are paying these
[28:10.480 --> 28:16.320]  networks in his case millions of dollars to put out government PR disguised as
[28:16.320 --> 28:19.200]  comedy because they don't listen to the news anymore so they hit the comedy
[28:19.200 --> 28:24.960]  shows the syndicated shows late-night shows but he came out and attacked Dr.
[28:24.960 --> 28:30.120]  Richard Bartlett who's been using Modestadine for a year and a half to
[28:30.120 --> 28:34.160]  save people and now even have an Oxford study saying he's right and and really
[28:34.160 --> 28:38.400]  attacking him viciously so I thought we get him on just to talk about why
[28:38.400 --> 28:42.600]  they're so scared of this and how much money would you have to take to be part
[28:42.600 --> 28:47.040]  of killing him like Howard Stern does I mean Howard Stern taking that money
[28:47.040 --> 28:51.880]  becomes a person aiding and abetting in my view of the murder of people by
[28:51.880 --> 28:56.480]  keeping life saving drugs away from stay with us
[28:56.480 --> 29:01.520]  hey everybody confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture me too
[29:01.520 --> 29:05.560]  but listen after all the research all the conflicting studies after all the
[29:05.560 --> 29:09.720]  squabbling there's one thing almost everyone agrees on it's that immune
[29:09.720 --> 29:13.440]  system health can literally be the difference between life and death you
[29:13.440 --> 29:17.480]  probably already believe that I certainly do so here's the thing I wanted
[29:17.480 --> 29:21.760]  to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually
[29:21.760 --> 29:26.440]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support now you'll
[29:26.440 --> 29:30.120]  have to sign a waiver but you can check out what I've discovered at stronger

[30:17.200 --> 30:20.720]  system and that's what we've done now one area of the immune system we don't
[30:20.720 --> 30:25.000]  talk enough about is deep restful sleep look it up for yourself the effects of
[30:25.000 --> 30:28.080]  deep restful sleep on health and the immune system and so with everything
[30:28.080 --> 30:31.720]  we're doing out there to boost our immune system with vitamin D and sink and
[30:31.720 --> 30:35.400]  all of that's great but deep restful sleep is just as important maybe more

[31:05.920 --> 31:12.200]  before some of the ingredients inside of these of these shots have never been
[31:12.200 --> 31:17.600]  injected in human beings before there are no long-term studies we don't know
[31:17.600 --> 31:21.720]  what's going to happen inside your body somewhere four to six weeks after your
[31:21.720 --> 31:28.040]  second injection or four to six months or even two years we have no idea
[31:28.040 --> 31:32.320]  whether it's going to cause infertility whether it's going to cause cancer how
[31:32.320 --> 31:36.920]  bad your autoimmune disease is going to be my conclusion after looking at this
[31:36.920 --> 31:40.640]  for a long time and listening to the arguments for these masks I've determined
[31:40.640 --> 31:44.840]  that if you believe if you're a medical doctor or a scientist that's spouting
[31:44.840 --> 31:49.440]  using these masks you're either being played or you're being paid secure your
[31:49.440 --> 31:53.800]  copy of Coventland today at Coventland.com if you order by October 6th
[31:53.800 --> 31:58.960]  you get a free copy of in-game blueprint for global enslavement. So when I first
[31:58.960 --> 32:03.280]  started taking survival skills basically I was 275 pounds I was overweight I had
[32:03.280 --> 32:07.480]  brain fog like you wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job and I
[32:07.480 --> 32:10.680]  heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it so the first one I got
[32:10.680 --> 32:14.640]  was the original survival shield the X1 and it worked pretty good and then
[32:14.640 --> 32:17.520]  shortly thereafter you came out with that too you have you know with a deep
[32:17.520 --> 32:20.680]  burden source you know and I got really excited about that so I took it and man
[32:20.680 --> 32:25.880]  in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was
[32:25.880 --> 32:30.040]  enlightened you know I could think again I could connect with people again and
[32:30.040 --> 32:34.000]  over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back and I
[32:34.000 --> 32:37.800]  religiously take basically all of your supplements they're all absolutely
[32:37.800 --> 32:41.560]  amazing supplements the one I like recently is knockout literally like if
[32:41.560 --> 32:45.040]  you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point
[32:45.040 --> 32:49.280]  is we have to get ourselves clean that's a break free of the globalist system and
[32:49.280 --> 32:53.240]  the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hand beautifully
[32:53.240 --> 32:58.000]  said brother I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed
[33:00.080 --> 33:05.520]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:09.000 --> 33:15.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[33:15.480 --> 33:22.480]  tyranny will so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[33:46.480 --> 33:52.280]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen broadcasting worldwide and there is a
[33:52.280 --> 33:57.720]  real attempt by big pharma and the UN and big corporations through government
[33:57.720 --> 34:05.080]  to suppress senator Rand Paul who's a medical doctor reading an Israeli study
[34:05.080 --> 34:11.320]  with natural immunity being 27 times better than the so-called vaccine I mean
[34:11.320 --> 34:15.640]  which they now admit basically disappears in most cases in just a few months
[34:15.640 --> 34:21.160]  well as a big article in Newsmax Rand Paul and dr. Richard Bartlett government
[34:21.160 --> 34:26.160]  needs to get out of the way of COVID treatments and dr. Bartlett has done
[34:26.160 --> 34:29.040]  hundreds and hundreds of interviews he's talked to hundreds of millions of
[34:29.040 --> 34:32.200]  people not just around the world and he's one of the top doctors that is
[34:32.200 --> 34:38.080]  selflessly for free steered people to online pharmacies to get known drugs
[34:38.080 --> 34:42.400]  that help people and in his case for free he's making no money doing that and
[34:42.400 --> 34:47.640]  working 20 hours a day and so imagine being Howard Stern they admit that
[34:47.640 --> 34:50.840]  basketball players have been paid hundreds of thousands of dollars some
[34:50.840 --> 34:55.480]  TV shows millions of dollars to put out these talking points the talking points
[34:55.480 --> 34:58.560]  we hear from Howard Stern are those talking points the one they've been
[34:58.560 --> 35:07.640]  beating is a host out of Tennessee who died of COVID well we've never said
[35:07.640 --> 35:11.720]  people aren't dying of COVID we've said they're blocking the treatments and and
[35:11.720 --> 35:17.640]  so they were attacking Bartlett because as best I could tell he'd been on that
[35:17.640 --> 35:21.320]  show and and oh look I wonder what Bartlett will do now this guy's died
[35:21.320 --> 35:26.440]  he'll find somebody else they're making a big joke about it meanwhile Pfizer
[35:26.440 --> 35:33.040]  launches final study for COVID drug that's suspiciously similar to ivermectin
[35:33.040 --> 35:39.920]  horse paste and Congress has exempted itself from these very same injections so
[35:39.920 --> 35:45.280]  I thought we'd get the doc on this segment next to respond to this because
[35:45.280 --> 35:49.040]  they weren't attacking for ivermectin they were attacking for the inhalable
[35:49.040 --> 35:56.200]  steroid that I witnessed my dad go from almost dead to 90% better the next day
[35:56.200 --> 36:01.440]  but here's here's Howard Stern really you know celebrating people's deaths I
[36:01.440 --> 36:05.400]  saw Laura Loomer got COVID they have a website celebrating conservatives that
[36:05.400 --> 36:10.280]  get it and saying will she be dead is the graveyard looming this is this is
[36:10.280 --> 36:16.840]  really sick here it is okay maybe you should have done that on the radio
[36:16.840 --> 36:24.600]  exactly yeah the other thing he would do is he'd bring in like guests to pitch
[36:24.600 --> 36:29.360]  with me like miracle cures for the other virus is harmless so why do you need
[36:29.360 --> 36:34.080]  to cure yeah why do you need anything but this guy came on dr. Richard Bartlett
[36:34.080 --> 36:38.960]  and he said in his practice there was a hundred percent COVID survival rate if
[36:38.960 --> 36:46.040]  you inhaled this steroid called pedesanide and I think cyanide right but I
[36:46.040 --> 36:54.480]  guess Phil never inhaled it because right died he got tape of that yeah clip
[36:54.480 --> 37:01.360]  to this guy came out I want to hear that you'll hear Phil's voice too ladies
[37:01.360 --> 37:06.680]  and gentlemen I have a guest today who has a cure for your COVID even though
[37:06.680 --> 37:11.280]  there is no such a thing but if you do get what that don't confess and I will
[37:11.280 --> 37:18.120]  save you turns out what they had given me as a generic at the drugstore was
[37:18.120 --> 37:22.640]  essentially what you were prescribing for folks with coronavirus why do you
[37:22.640 --> 37:26.960]  pronounce this again do you death denied if you use the breathing treatment
[37:26.960 --> 37:31.720]  it's targeted medicine it's like turning the faucet off for the poisons to be
[37:31.720 --> 37:36.760]  delivered into the bloodstream and so it's a game changer I had we've been
[37:36.760 --> 37:41.760]  using this since March zero of my patients have died zero percent of my
[37:41.760 --> 37:45.600]  patients I know thousands are being have been treated with this do you death
[37:45.600 --> 37:51.320]  denied works.com is the website it's $3 a treatment it's pre-mixed pre-measured
[37:51.320 --> 37:58.320]  this is a winning strategy. Gee, amazing none of us have heard of that.
[37:58.320 --> 38:03.320]  And none of us know whether, none of us know whether the people he gave this to had COVID.
[38:03.320 --> 38:08.560]  I just wonder Phil took a little divest tonight before he went. I guess not if it's
[38:08.560 --> 38:12.840]  a hundred percent survival rate. Well it's pretty good odds even still if you
[38:12.840 --> 38:18.200]  had on like all your patients lived except for Phil so. Okay so let's stop
[38:18.200 --> 38:22.680]  right there let me tell you something Howard Stern my dad lives here in town
[38:22.680 --> 38:27.480]  71 years old and you know he's in decent shape but and I've known him my
[38:27.480 --> 38:33.560]  whole life my dad David Jones David Ross Jones and he didn't tell me he was
[38:33.560 --> 38:37.040]  sick and I went over to his house he had like 82 oxygen when I tested him he was
[38:37.040 --> 38:41.800]  blue naked in the bed didn't know he was couldn't get up and I called Dr. Bartlett
[38:41.800 --> 38:44.720]  and he called in a prescription had to find a pharmacy that would give it to us
[38:44.720 --> 38:52.080]  and my dad was 50% better within about five hours and I stayed there that night
[38:52.080 --> 38:55.280]  by about three in the morning he was about 67% better in the next day I've
[38:55.280 --> 38:58.240]  told the store many times they've been sitting out there for a week when I got
[38:58.240 --> 39:02.760]  there a bunch of packages and four or five boxes of pool chairs his old pool
[39:02.760 --> 39:07.360]  chairs got old and fell apart finally got some new pool chairs and he was there
[39:07.360 --> 39:10.760]  putting them together in the morning now he still had brain fog and stuff but he
[39:10.760 --> 39:16.680]  was oxygen was like 96 he was back and that was all with what Dr. Bartlett
[39:16.680 --> 39:22.360]  prescribed and so you talk about the evil making jokes about this when Dr.
[39:22.360 --> 39:27.440]  Bartlett was you know the head a board head for Governor Rick Perry on the
[39:27.440 --> 39:32.000]  state's medical board and and you know runs a hospital emergency room and it's
[39:32.000 --> 39:35.560]  very respected and tirelessly helps people I know he helped more than a
[39:35.560 --> 39:39.920]  hundred people that I gave his number two and then they gave the number until
[39:39.920 --> 39:43.320]  he was helping thousands of people I would imagine I mean it's insane good
[39:43.320 --> 39:47.720]  to compare this guy to stern but it's very sad that stern would sell his soul
[39:47.720 --> 39:51.640]  like this I guess he's always been this bad maybe to do this it's very sense
[39:51.640 --> 39:54.040]  want to just bring the docking who's very busy can only do it over the phone
[39:54.040 --> 39:58.320]  he'll be with us next segment too but Dr. Bartlett I mean you have the studies
[39:58.320 --> 40:01.440]  now since you first started doing this they've admitted it what in Oxford many
[40:01.440 --> 40:05.480]  other places that Budesidine's really good it's even on the news that inhalable
[40:05.480 --> 40:09.320]  steroids that you pioneered are having a great effect because we know a lot of
[40:09.320 --> 40:12.400]  viruses kill people with the autoimmune response right or the inflammation
[40:12.400 --> 40:17.160]  explain this and what it's like to stern goes on I guess you imply you're
[40:17.160 --> 40:20.640]  making money off this and that you're killing people what do you want to say
[40:20.640 --> 40:25.360]  to Howard Stern doctor are you talking about that clown that hides behind a a
[40:25.360 --> 40:31.400]  wig and glasses that's just a talking head are you talking about that guy yes
[40:31.400 --> 40:37.640]  sir well for he and his minions to say they've never heard of Budesidine it
[40:37.640 --> 40:43.120]  shows that obviously haven't gone to medical school and so you death night is
[40:43.120 --> 40:49.960]  an inhaled steroid that's been around for over two decades there's a ton of
[40:49.960 --> 40:55.840]  information out there on it many studies this is the medicine that event
[40:55.840 --> 41:00.880]  that I was talking about using against COVID early because it's an inhaled
[41:00.880 --> 41:06.440]  steroid it's targeted it's a targeted approach of using an inhaled steroid
[41:06.440 --> 41:11.120]  instead of using IV steroids Oxford University is the oldest university in
[41:11.120 --> 41:15.160]  the English-speaking world they did the stoic trial a randomized controlled
[41:15.160 --> 41:20.920]  trial and they concluded that 90% of COVID hospitalization ER visits and
[41:20.920 --> 41:24.520]  urgent care visits would be prevented with just that one medicine inhaled you
[41:24.520 --> 41:28.360]  death night against COVID I'm not surprised that Howard Stern hasn't done
[41:28.360 --> 41:33.400]  his homework he's just reading what they tell him to read and as an he's not a
[41:33.400 --> 41:37.320]  doctor and obviously he hasn't asked anybody that was intelligent to do
[41:37.320 --> 41:42.480]  research before they did the show but he did us a favor he let the cat out of
[41:42.480 --> 41:46.600]  the bag there is effective early outpatient treatment inhaled you death
[41:46.600 --> 41:52.600]  tonight monoclonal antibodies I'm actually you're you hit you're right I
[41:52.600 --> 41:57.160]  work for good I was a top advisor for Governor Rick Perry for seven years and
[41:57.160 --> 42:01.840]  I received the Meritorious Service Award from the Commissioner of Health and
[42:01.840 --> 42:05.240]  Human Services it was a surprise at the end of seven years they were grateful
[42:05.240 --> 42:10.360]  for my efforts but now I'm helping with a new project with the new governor
[42:10.360 --> 42:15.160]  governor Abbott and this is with the Texas division of emergency management
[42:15.160 --> 42:19.440]  where we're doing monoclonal antibody infusion and I'm sure Howard Stern
[42:19.440 --> 42:22.880]  hasn't heard of that even though you're not tuning your horn but you help get
[42:22.880 --> 42:25.760]  the governor to do this and then with taxpayer money provided to the public
[42:25.760 --> 42:30.960]  because you're such a cook yeah I'm such a cook that I am when I get a call on
[42:30.960 --> 42:35.880]  Friday saying would you please help with this the emergency Texas emergency
[42:35.880 --> 42:40.720]  management project for West Texas where you live for your people that I am so
[42:40.720 --> 42:44.640]  crazy that I get that text on Friday and on Monday I'm dressed like a walking
[42:44.640 --> 42:50.280]  marshmallow in universal precautions and for 11 hour days six days a week I'm
[42:50.280 --> 42:56.880]  only around infectious COVID doctor stay right there we'll be right back by now
[42:56.880 --> 43:00.120]  you've heard me talk about the bio-prose and how they're creating amazing
[43:00.120 --> 43:04.960]  products they've done it again and have just released an entire suite of bio

[44:48.920 --> 44:52.520]  things that make you healthy make your life better and they find the info war
[44:52.520 --> 44:57.960]  again only we lose is if you don't take action right now and in addition we were
[44:57.960 --> 45:01.760]  really finding that we were stressing the cardiopulmonary systems of these
[45:01.760 --> 45:05.680]  employees because when you cover the mouth and nose and you exert physical
[45:05.680 --> 45:10.160]  energy during your work during your tasks whatever it might be you're really
[45:10.160 --> 45:13.040]  stressing the cardiopulmonary system because you change the way that you
[45:13.040 --> 45:18.600]  breathe you have to forcibly inhale and forcibly exhale that taxes the heart it
[45:18.600 --> 45:23.040]  taxes the lungs and we have given people heart attacks by allowing them to work
[45:23.040 --> 45:29.600]  with our mouth and nose covered with absolutely no regulation no oversight no
[45:29.600 --> 45:34.000]  medical oversight. The globalists have told us we're a disease they've told us
[45:34.000 --> 45:36.880]  they want to eradicate us and all the studies show that when you wear these
[45:36.880 --> 45:42.160]  masks it lowers your oxygen level up to one-third and gives you dangerous levels
[45:42.160 --> 45:47.240]  of carbon dioxide poisoning. This is a sick cult and we've got to say no but the
[45:47.240 --> 45:51.320]  only way the real science comes out of the public is if we tell them get your
[45:51.320 --> 45:57.320]  copy today of Covidland and expose them it's Covidland.com go there now. It is
[45:57.320 --> 46:02.200]  through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies
[46:02.200 --> 46:06.200]  we are told and the only way to see through this illusion is with our
[46:06.200 --> 46:11.520]  higher senses which is why fluoridated water is a big problem. Consuming too
[46:11.520 --> 46:16.000]  much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down
[46:16.000 --> 46:21.040]  its natural functions. Natural functions which have been known for millennia. The
[46:21.040 --> 46:24.800]  Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system. The chakra aligned with the
[46:24.800 --> 46:29.880]  pineal gland is the third eye also described as the seat of the soul. The
[46:29.880 --> 46:33.680]  pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and
[46:33.680 --> 46:39.560]  otherwise unseen dimensions of reality. Fluoride free water is essential to
[46:39.560 --> 46:44.800]  keeping our pineal gland healthy. Our water filtration systems with the proper
[46:44.800 --> 46:49.480]  filters will keep your drinking water fluoride free and the propure shower
[46:49.480 --> 46:54.800]  head will seal the deal. Get them both today for yourself or a friend at
[46:54.800 --> 46:58.000]  infowarsstore.com
[46:58.000 --> 47:09.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:21.000 --> 47:26.000]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[47:26.000 --> 47:31.760]  All right Dr. Richard Bartlett who helped popularize Budesidide as a way to
[47:31.760 --> 47:36.040]  counter this inflammation. I know doctor like he is. I remember reading about the
[47:36.040 --> 47:40.840]  Spanish flu killing 20, 30, 40 million. They debate the numbers saying it
[47:40.840 --> 47:44.760]  wasn't the virus necessarily that killed you. It was your body's autoimmune
[47:44.760 --> 47:49.520]  response filling up with fluid. But I'm a layperson. Doc, can you explain to
[47:49.520 --> 47:55.760]  Howard Stern and other people why? Sure, you tried it on your your patients
[47:55.760 --> 48:00.720]  and it worked. But why you were already thinking about that? Because am I not
[48:00.720 --> 48:05.120]  wrong in saying it's well known that for a lot of you know type of viral issues
[48:05.120 --> 48:08.760]  sometimes that they try to try out steroids and see if that works and can
[48:08.760 --> 48:12.920]  you explain to Howard Stern who will put on screen and others because he can save
[48:12.920 --> 48:16.000]  a lot of lives telling people about this. I mean maybe he's just ignorant.
[48:16.000 --> 48:19.960]  Hopefully he can turn back from this and not aid in the bed you know keeping
[48:19.960 --> 48:22.880]  medical treatment from people. I mean hopefully he's not a eugenicist and a
[48:22.880 --> 48:26.920]  populationist. I don't think he's a Nazi hopefully. But can you speak to what the
[48:26.920 --> 48:32.080]  Oxford study says for Howard? Okay listen carefully Howard. You might get your
[48:32.080 --> 48:37.000]  crayons out and write some things down. Number one what happens with COVID is
[48:37.000 --> 48:41.520]  you have a respiratory viral illness. This virus is enters the body through the
[48:41.520 --> 48:46.720]  nose, the throat, the eye and multiplies for three to five days, goes into the
[48:46.720 --> 48:54.200]  lungs and triggers it goes the doorway into the body is the ACE receptors. This
[48:54.200 --> 48:59.760]  virus goes through ACE receptors into cells and starts to multiply and trigger
[48:59.760 --> 49:05.560]  the release of cytokines. That's a fancy word for inflammatory chemicals that are
[49:05.560 --> 49:12.440]  released. Interleukin 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 13, 15, tumor necrosis factor, thromboxane
[49:12.440 --> 49:16.120]  which increases the chance of clotting which would be a heart attack stroke or
[49:16.120 --> 49:22.120]  pulmonary embolus, leukotriene and other dangerous chemicals. Those all cause an
[49:22.120 --> 49:29.000]  inflammatory response which then will lead to multi organ failure if it goes
[49:29.000 --> 49:33.160]  unchecked. And those chemicals go through the bloodstream total body. The
[49:33.160 --> 49:37.280]  first place that's it obviously is the lungs usually. But it caught all of the
[49:37.280 --> 49:43.240]  symptoms whether it's the headache or fever, body ache, diarrhea. Those all are
[49:43.240 --> 49:47.680]  the result of cytokines released from the lining in the lung tissue. And so
[49:47.680 --> 49:52.280]  inhaled steroid eudepsinide in particular was studied by the country of
[49:52.280 --> 50:01.440]  Spain, France, UK, at Oxford University, Australia, NIH. For a reason they all
[50:01.440 --> 50:05.880]  landed on the same medicine after I announced it. And that medicine is
[50:05.880 --> 50:10.400]  eudepsinide and inhaled steroid that cost $3 a treatment. Nobody's going to get
[50:10.400 --> 50:14.920]  rich off of it. It's so safe it's been used on two-pound premature babies in
[50:14.920 --> 50:20.000]  the NICU for decades. And doctors never bat an eye using it. That's about as
[50:20.000 --> 50:25.040]  delicate a human on the planet as there is. And yet it's inexpensive, it's
[50:25.040 --> 50:28.280]  readily available. It's a medicine that every pharmacy on every corner in the
[50:28.280 --> 50:32.720]  United States, it's in every hospital pharmacy is being used around the world
[50:32.720 --> 50:38.240]  now that we've talked about it and it's blown up around the world. And so there
[50:38.240 --> 50:43.160]  are doctors around the world treating their patients in India, Australia,
[50:43.160 --> 50:47.280]  around the world with inhaled eudepsinide because it's very targeted, very
[50:47.280 --> 50:51.840]  specific. France even studied eudepsinide eye drops against COVID and showed that
[50:51.840 --> 50:56.080]  it was effective. Why are they landing on that one medicine? This is why Howard.
[50:56.080 --> 51:01.520]  It does two things. Number one, it stops the release of cytokines right at the
[51:01.520 --> 51:06.720]  source. Secondly, it down-regulates ACE receptors. Children have less ACE
[51:06.720 --> 51:10.440]  receptors and every year they have more and more ACE receptors. So they're 23
[51:10.440 --> 51:15.040]  to 24 years old and then they have a maximum level of ACE receptors. Remember
[51:15.040 --> 51:18.680]  that ACE receptors are the doorway for the virus to get into the body. That's
[51:18.680 --> 51:23.120]  the secret why children have less trouble with COVID than adults because
[51:23.120 --> 51:26.640]  they have less ACE receptors. So if you down-regulate the ACE receptors with
[51:26.640 --> 51:30.840]  the inhaled eudepsinide, that's a good thing. Well, all I know is I got COVID
[51:30.840 --> 51:34.720]  from my parents after I took care of them and it felt like a gorilla sitting on
[51:34.720 --> 51:40.040]  my chest and so we're not denying this stuff goes on. We know Fauci cooked it up
[51:40.040 --> 51:43.440]  in that lab. It's all come out. It's a bioweapon and then they basically have to
[51:43.440 --> 51:46.960]  admit that now. The documents have come out. Shifting gears into that, what do
[51:46.960 --> 51:52.000]  you make of the actual documents that have now come out in the last month where
[51:52.000 --> 51:56.840]  they state that they combined four viruses together to be able to infect
[51:56.840 --> 52:01.840]  humans and added the HIV delivery system as well and it describes COVID
[52:01.840 --> 52:06.800]  perfectly and then Fauci orders Peter Dazik to approach the Pentagon in DARPA
[52:06.800 --> 52:12.760]  for 14 million to aerosolize it in micro glass pellets to go through the skin
[52:12.760 --> 52:16.360]  of bats and the Pentagon said, no, that'll infect humans. I mean, that's not just
[52:16.360 --> 52:20.680]  creating any function. That's making the COVID-19 style coronavirus and then
[52:20.680 --> 52:25.280]  saying that they wanted to, I know we're shifting gears here, deploy it into the
[52:25.280 --> 52:32.000]  open air, doctor. That's insane, but there are people that are insane and so
[52:32.000 --> 52:39.320]  that are evil. Evil really does exist and so the bottom line, these are bioweapons.
[52:39.320 --> 52:44.720]  What they chose was a highly contagious virus that is normally very benign.
[52:44.720 --> 52:49.240]  Coronavirus normally causes the common cold and they weaponized it and that
[52:49.240 --> 52:55.160]  made it a weapon of mass destruction. The evidence is here now. This is
[52:55.160 --> 52:59.320]  a disease that you have to take seriously. Unfortunately, many people thought it
[52:59.320 --> 53:03.360]  would be just like the flu or something else that we've seen before. This is a
[53:03.360 --> 53:09.040]  disease that we've never had before. It's man-made. I want to say congratulations.
[53:09.040 --> 53:15.920]  I applaud Senator Rand Paul for his courage to out Fauci, to wave the
[53:15.920 --> 53:20.440]  documents showing evidence under Fauci's nose, putting him on his heels. Fauci was
[53:20.440 --> 53:27.840]  on his heels, red-faced, caught red-handed and stuttering, stammering because he had
[53:27.840 --> 53:32.040]  been caught in front of the whole world on the Senate floor. Congratulations, Rand
[53:32.040 --> 53:36.760]  Paul, for your courage. Senator Tom Cotton has been talking about this
[53:36.760 --> 53:41.560]  looking like a bioweapon for a year. Alex, you and I are not in those
[53:41.560 --> 53:47.240]  meetings with the CIA and with the heads of national security, giving us briefings
[53:47.240 --> 53:51.320]  like the senators get. They've been telling the world what's been going on
[53:51.320 --> 53:55.160]  for a long time to their credit. And I'll tell you, Senator Ron Johnson has also
[53:55.160 --> 53:58.840]  made the point that there's early effective outpatient treatment, but
[53:58.840 --> 54:04.760]  Governor DeSantis has blown it out of the water. He has proven that early
[54:04.760 --> 54:08.240]  effective outpatient treatment is a winning strategy, whether you've been
[54:08.240 --> 54:14.260]  vaccinated or not. The monoclonal antibodies work. Absolutely. I think
[54:14.260 --> 54:17.960]  Howard Stern is taking money like so many other influencers. I don't know
[54:17.960 --> 54:22.400]  that. I'd like people to ask him that to read these statements. And I think he
[54:22.400 --> 54:25.560]  really should think about what he's done. And I know, Doc, you want to focus on
[54:25.560 --> 54:29.800]  solutions? Let's talk about that. You've been promoting a Regeneron for a long
[54:29.800 --> 54:33.800]  time, and now you help bring it to Texas, and now you're working with the
[54:33.800 --> 54:37.840]  governor on that. And when I asked you a month ago about it, you said, well, I don't
[54:37.840 --> 54:43.000]  want to get into it. When I asked you if Biden was trying to suppress that, well,
[54:43.000 --> 54:46.920]  then it was confirmed two weeks ago that he has been trying to ration that. So I
[54:46.920 --> 54:51.400]  know Texas governor and others have gone to directly now get it. What do you make
[54:51.400 --> 54:57.320]  of that action by the president, the so-called president? Inexcusable. And
[54:57.320 --> 55:01.960]  there's many other adjectives and words that could be used as well. But I'll
[55:01.960 --> 55:06.560]  tell you what, don't discriminate against somebody against an American just
[55:06.560 --> 55:10.240]  because he lives in Texas or Florida. Don't discriminate because they've been
[55:10.240 --> 55:15.040]  vaccinated. There was also talk about not allowing the vaccinated to receive
[55:15.040 --> 55:20.360]  this potentially life-saving medicine. 70% decrease in death if you receive the
[55:20.360 --> 55:24.800]  monoclonal antibody infusion. Why would you withhold that from an American,
[55:24.800 --> 55:29.400]  whether he's vaccinated or not? Why would you withhold that from an American
[55:29.400 --> 55:35.520]  that lives in a certain state? So this is insanity. This is crazy.
[55:35.520 --> 55:43.400]  Thank God for DeSantis leading the way again of problem-solving and making
[55:43.400 --> 55:47.560]  sure his people under his influence in Florida had a workaround and they got
[55:47.560 --> 55:52.320]  monoclonal antibodies from a different source. And congratulations to Governor
[55:52.320 --> 55:56.960]  Abbott for doing the same for Texas. We have what we need here in West
[55:56.960 --> 56:02.000]  Texas where I am. But that decreases the risk of hospitalization or death by
[56:02.000 --> 56:06.720]  70%. BUDESINIDE decreases the risk of hospitalization. 90%.
[56:06.720 --> 56:13.040]  Coward Stern did us a favor when he mentioned BUDESINIDE. Coward Stern,
[56:13.040 --> 56:18.320]  who hides in a costume of a wig and glasses, did us a favor when he
[56:18.320 --> 56:21.720]  mentioned my name because people will do an online search and they'll come
[56:21.720 --> 56:25.320]  across some life-saving treatment. No, you're right. I was meaning to make that
[56:25.320 --> 56:28.840]  point, but you made it better than I would. I mean, this is how no weapon
[56:28.840 --> 56:32.440]  formed against us. He'll prosper, how his attack is now being turned towards good.
[56:32.440 --> 56:36.720]  And in closing, I wanted to say this, do five more minutes. I don't have to get
[56:36.720 --> 56:38.680]  back to work, but I'll take a two-minute break. I want to ask you when we come
[56:38.680 --> 56:43.320]  back. Pfizer launched its final study for COVID drug that's suspiciously similar
[56:43.320 --> 56:47.320]  to horse paste. And it turns out right here in the article, ladies and
[56:47.320 --> 56:50.600]  gentlemen, they go on to link and admit it's got basically some of the same
[56:50.600 --> 56:55.280]  ingredients of ivermectin. Wow. We're going to go to break, come back and get
[56:55.280 --> 57:02.320]  Dr. Richard Bartlett's take on that. And then we've got a loaded group of guests
[57:02.320 --> 57:05.960]  joining us today, including Dr. Zalinko. I'll be with us for the last hour and
[57:05.960 --> 57:10.840]  a half of the show. And we've got so much more I'm going to hit. We also have a
[57:10.840 --> 57:16.440]  Texas judge, a George Soros funded judge, literally beyond the kangaroo court,
[57:16.440 --> 57:20.560]  because at least in, again, in Australia, they'd have a fake jury of kangaroos
[57:20.560 --> 57:24.920]  as the joke. She said, I don't get a jury trial on the Sandy Hook defamation
[57:24.920 --> 57:28.680]  case, because I would, you know, win that because what they say I've done, I haven't
[57:28.680 --> 57:34.640]  done First Amendment. So she says I'm defaulted and that she's going to decide.
[57:34.640 --> 57:38.200]  So no more jury trials in Democrat controlled areas. You ask why live in
[57:38.200 --> 57:41.840]  Austin? Well, my family's been here since the 1820s. What am I supposed to do?
[57:41.840 --> 57:55.760]  But I got to get out soon. We'll be right back.
[58:11.840 --> 58:19.360]  I also need you to wear masks and they also need you to only shop at mega
[58:19.360 --> 58:26.800]  corporations. That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy,
[58:26.800 --> 58:33.680]  leaving companies that only I own profitable. You will then be my slaves.
[58:33.680 --> 58:51.320]  A month ago, we sold out of our first shipment in only three days. It is

[59:49.040 --> 1:00:00.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:00.920 --> 1:00:07.680]  All right, we're back live. Just five minutes left with our special guest who I
[1:00:07.680 --> 1:00:14.040]  really appreciate joining us, Dr Bartlett. Dr Bartlett, looking at Pfizer coming
[1:00:14.040 --> 1:00:17.840]  out and saying, Oh, we want a pill you take twice a day to protect you from
[1:00:17.840 --> 1:00:21.600]  COVID. And then we go look at it and it's got some of the same underlying
[1:00:21.600 --> 1:00:26.760]  ingredients and mechanisms as being reported. A pro-tease inhibitor. Am I
[1:00:26.760 --> 1:00:29.560]  saying that wrong? What's going on here? And what do you make of this?
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:37.440]  Okay, so a year ago, over a year ago, I said, we have early effective, inexpensive,
[1:00:37.760 --> 1:00:43.480]  safe, readily available treatment strategies for COVID. Why are we even
[1:00:43.480 --> 1:00:47.520]  talking about a vaccine is what I said. But why wouldn't we be talking about
[1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:53.160]  expensive, experimental medicines when we have generic, readily available,
[1:00:53.160 --> 1:00:57.400]  inexpensive, safe medicines that are already proven to be effective? Why
[1:00:57.400 --> 1:01:02.880]  would I say it's effective? Howard Stern, listen, Stoic trial, a randomized
[1:01:02.880 --> 1:01:07.880]  controlled trial, the principal trial, a randomized controlled trial by Oxford
[1:01:07.880 --> 1:01:11.640]  University. They've been around since 1096, the oldest university in the
[1:01:11.640 --> 1:01:16.400]  English speaking world. You know, Dr Zalinko is a hero. He's the one who
[1:01:16.400 --> 1:01:21.160]  first had the courage to say, Hey, I'm treating this with early effective
[1:01:21.160 --> 1:01:26.440]  outpatient treatment. And you know what? Kudos to him. He's right. That's the
[1:01:26.440 --> 1:01:32.200]  winning strategy. When we were told in January to hide shelter in place by
[1:01:32.200 --> 1:01:36.120]  Fauci until he comes up with the vaccine. And that was our that was his
[1:01:36.120 --> 1:01:40.720]  strategy that he presented to the world. We're talking about the guy who's been
[1:01:40.720 --> 1:01:45.360]  chasing a vaccine against HIV for over 30 years and failed over and over and
[1:01:45.360 --> 1:01:49.520]  over again. We're going to trust him and follow him to come up with something
[1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:54.840]  when he's failed at that same strategy over and over. I think the other thing
[1:01:54.840 --> 1:01:58.680]  I want to mention real quick is I've heard that we all these deaths and
[1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:02.920]  disabilities that are happening from the shot are because we've never had this
[1:02:02.920 --> 1:02:09.200]  many people vaccinated before. BF, that's how we call it in Texas. I have
[1:02:09.200 --> 1:02:14.240]  been practicing for 30 years and I've been taking care of people who have been
[1:02:14.240 --> 1:02:19.440]  vaccinated to polio, measles, mumps, rubella. I have never taken care of a
[1:02:19.440 --> 1:02:26.560]  vaccine vaccination injury like I am now to the COVID shot. I have been the ER
[1:02:26.560 --> 1:02:31.840]  doctor taking care of people who have had strokes, Guillain-Barre syndrome,
[1:02:31.840 --> 1:02:36.280]  transverse myelitis where their spinal cord is hit. They've become pulmonary
[1:02:36.280 --> 1:02:40.280]  cripples because they're right after receiving the shot. I have seen every
[1:02:40.280 --> 1:02:43.760]  one of these and been the doctor taking care of them in the emergency room. I
[1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:48.880]  have never had patients who have received other vaccines coming in the ER
[1:02:48.880 --> 1:02:58.360]  with these conditions. Finally, we got 330 million Americans.
[1:02:58.360 --> 1:03:01.920]  Every one of them had to get shots including the tetanus shot periodically
[1:03:01.920 --> 1:03:06.320]  which is a vaccine. I have never seen anybody with a tetanus shot come in
[1:03:06.320 --> 1:03:10.440]  with any of those conditions that I just described but I guarantee there are
[1:03:10.440 --> 1:03:14.720]  more people that have received a tetanus shot than the COVID shot.
[1:03:14.720 --> 1:03:17.680]  Oh absolutely, well let me take this. Even the British government and the
[1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:21.520]  Scottish government, all of them are reporting including the U.S. their own
[1:03:21.520 --> 1:03:25.320]  doctors are saying officially statistics the specific type of heart
[1:03:25.320 --> 1:03:30.800]  attacks from blood clots is up 25 percent. Right, so we've never seen that with
[1:03:30.800 --> 1:03:37.640]  the polio vaccine. Coward sterns, take off the wig and the glasses and
[1:03:37.640 --> 1:03:45.160]  think, get a little sunlight. Listen, I challenge Howard Sterns to join me on
[1:03:45.160 --> 1:03:51.080]  Alex Jones' show, Infowars, and we'll have a discussion and we'll see how that goes.
[1:03:51.080 --> 1:03:54.600]  Well I'll probably just have a puppet piece about you. He does that with me.
[1:03:54.600 --> 1:03:58.360]  It's very sad to see him, I believe, taking money to put the talking point
[1:03:58.360 --> 1:04:02.280]  out. It's very sick and they obviously don't want you promoting sites. I know
[1:04:02.280 --> 1:04:05.400]  it's not your site, you don't sell it but where's the best place for people to go
[1:04:05.400 --> 1:04:09.640]  if they can't find a doctor that actually cares about them. Here's what they
[1:04:09.640 --> 1:04:14.240]  need. There are many people that are saving lives including Dr. Zelinko in
[1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:18.480]  New York and Ben Marble in Florida, both nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize
[1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:26.760]  appropriately so. And so there's SynergyHealthDPC.com is a online
[1:04:26.760 --> 1:04:32.640]  telemedicine service that is using my protocol and SynergyHealthDPC.com and
[1:04:32.640 --> 1:04:38.160]  ViewDesignWorx.com ViewDesignWorx.com and click the providers tab. There's
[1:04:38.160 --> 1:04:42.680]  providers in almost every state. Alright, God bless you and thank you for saving
[1:04:42.680 --> 1:04:46.440]  my dad. He was gonna die for sure. 82% oxygen. Amazing. Thanks for helping my mom
[1:04:46.440 --> 1:04:50.480]  and thanks for helping me. God bless you, sir. Thank you.
[1:04:51.480 --> 1:04:57.800]  Alright, God bless you. Thank you, sir. There goes the thought criminal. Could you
[1:04:57.800 --> 1:05:03.600]  imagine a year ago walking into a bank with your face covered? Could you imagine
[1:05:03.600 --> 1:05:06.800]  even going into the grocery store? Do you think they would let you in? Do you
[1:05:06.800 --> 1:05:09.440]  think they would be following you in the aisles to make sure that you weren't
[1:05:09.440 --> 1:05:15.840]  gonna be shoplifting? Could you imagine going up to a gas station and going
[1:05:15.840 --> 1:05:19.960]  inside the little mini-mart to pay for your gas with a bandana on? How far do
[1:05:19.960 --> 1:05:23.080]  you think that would get you? Could you imagine as a teacher showing up to
[1:05:23.080 --> 1:05:29.200]  school with it with a shield that looks like a space alien? Those things are
[1:05:29.200 --> 1:05:34.720]  offensive to us because it interferes with normal human interaction. The
[1:05:34.720 --> 1:05:38.520]  globalists are running a psychological war for operational humanity. Only
[1:05:38.520 --> 1:05:42.640]  waking up to the great reset in its tyranny will save us. And the mask is
[1:05:42.640 --> 1:05:46.560]  the sign of slavery. We must inform the public that it's a fraud and that it's
[1:05:46.560 --> 1:05:50.240]  dangerous and that it causes major medical issues and it's dehumanizing. And

[1:06:02.720 --> 1:06:09.800]  You are either with the Republic or against it. Resistance to Titans is
[1:06:09.800 --> 1:06:27.800]  obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[1:06:27.800 --> 1:06:34.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you for joining us in hour number two.
[1:06:34.840 --> 1:06:38.160]  You're the reason we're still on air. You're the reason we've reached so many
[1:06:38.160 --> 1:06:41.720]  people. I want to make an announcement here before I hit just the incredible
[1:06:41.720 --> 1:06:47.120]  news this hour after we had Dr. Richard Bartlin on joining us last hour. If you
[1:06:47.120 --> 1:06:52.440]  just joined us, they now have released the ingredients on Pfizer's new miracle
[1:06:52.440 --> 1:07:02.440]  pill that cures covid. Cybermectin. I'm sorry. That's just one of like 500
[1:07:02.440 --> 1:07:05.640]  stories that are just as insane. I mean, I'm totally overwhelmed. I know you're
[1:07:05.640 --> 1:07:10.640]  overloaded because everything they do is just being exposed to fraud.
[1:07:10.640 --> 1:07:17.800]  Unbelievable. It's like they prove fish oil and krill oil helps with heart
[1:07:17.800 --> 1:07:22.000]  attacks and your brain and your health and your skin. And so now they're
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:26.760]  patenting fish oil and coming out with $200 bottles of fish oil that your
[1:07:26.760 --> 1:07:33.280]  doctor prescribes. I mean, it's just it's crazy. But if we weren't exposing us, if
[1:07:33.280 --> 1:07:36.680]  you weren't spreading the word, they wouldn't even be coming out with that.
[1:07:36.680 --> 1:07:41.760]  They just block it. Yeah, there's the Drudge Report headline. Oh my gosh, a pill
[1:07:41.760 --> 1:07:46.120]  that cuts the death rate in half. If you get to it early, it's almost 100% and
[1:07:46.120 --> 1:07:54.320]  that's what the Japanese National and Tokyo Doctors Association said. Oh, don't
[1:07:54.320 --> 1:07:57.760]  listen to them. They're just don't listen to the last Dr. Jones said he was just
[1:07:57.760 --> 1:08:03.160]  the head of Rick Perry's Medical Commission for seven years. The guy the state goes
[1:08:03.160 --> 1:08:09.800]  to for advice on legislation. Oh, oh, now he's Governor Abbott's chief advisor.
[1:08:09.800 --> 1:08:14.800]  You know, just shut up. So you're the head of the Tokyo Medical Doctors
[1:08:14.800 --> 1:08:18.440]  Association and says you've treated through your doctor's 10,000 people with
[1:08:18.440 --> 1:08:23.240]  100% success rate of caudalative ivermectin. Shut up. Howard Stern has
[1:08:23.240 --> 1:08:30.440]  a bozo the clown hairdo and wears purple John Lening glasses. Shut up. Mick
[1:08:30.440 --> 1:08:34.760]  Jagger's jumping around on stage. He says take the shot. How about you burn in
[1:08:34.760 --> 1:08:41.080]  hell? How about that? Good Lord? Oh, but their answer is arrest all the talk show
[1:08:41.080 --> 1:08:46.320]  hosts and sue us and had judges not let us have jury trials and do death penalty
[1:08:46.320 --> 1:08:50.440]  sanctioned judgments that are supposed to be if you don't even show up to trial
[1:08:50.440 --> 1:08:56.200]  because they're desperate because their systems falling apart because they're
[1:08:56.200 --> 1:09:01.320]  authoritarians and it's because it's all they know. John Hancock signed his name
[1:09:01.320 --> 1:09:05.120]  big and bold on the Declaration of Independence knowing it was either
[1:09:05.120 --> 1:09:09.960]  victory or a death sentence. Now, I don't tempt fate like that. I sound the
[1:09:09.960 --> 1:09:16.040]  Declaration of Independence. I'm out of sight at medium size. But you know, at the
[1:09:16.040 --> 1:09:20.400]  same time, if God signs your signature big and blesses you and puts you in a
[1:09:20.400 --> 1:09:24.520]  position that the biggest signature on that piece of paper after Donald Trump
[1:09:24.520 --> 1:09:28.120]  when it comes to effecting change, you better go ahead and thank God and give
[1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:31.360]  God the praise. I'm gonna do that right now that hit the incredible abortion news
[1:09:31.360 --> 1:09:36.480]  beyond clown shows. It's so serious like vampire comedy hour or something but
[1:09:36.480 --> 1:09:42.760]  that's coming up next segment. Because of the listeners keeping us on air and the
[1:09:42.760 --> 1:09:47.920]  guest in the history of the show and in God working mysterious ways, I can tell
[1:09:47.920 --> 1:09:57.160]  you that we woke up the entire system and strata. This show was the main
[1:09:57.160 --> 1:10:01.280]  engine, it was a lot of other folks as well, but we were the main engine of Steve
[1:10:01.280 --> 1:10:08.840]  Bannon advising Trump and where Trump went and Miller in the White House and
[1:10:08.840 --> 1:10:17.120]  with so many people, Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan, to a certain extent Steven
[1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:19.920]  Crowder. I mean we've influenced everybody and then there I am at Glen
[1:10:19.920 --> 1:10:23.760]  Beck's headquarters and he gives me a painting and I talked to a bunch of his
[1:10:23.760 --> 1:10:27.400]  crew and they say yeah we can't believe that it's all come true the stuff you
[1:10:27.400 --> 1:10:34.560]  talked about. And so again, Info Wars has now hit its stride. We have just now
[1:10:34.560 --> 1:10:42.120]  gone into a three-stage rock at the third stage. I mean we've done it. The
[1:10:42.120 --> 1:10:46.120]  world's in trouble, things are crazy, it's dangerous and I may have to get
[1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:49.240]  killed or put in prison and I'm ready for that. I'm not happy about it, I don't
[1:10:49.240 --> 1:10:52.720]  like it, but I'm strong. I mean I'm gonna go on to the end whatever the cost may
[1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:58.880]  be because the alternative is total slavery and separation from God and I'm
[1:10:58.880 --> 1:11:03.520]  not gonna be part of that. I'm not gonna take the 20 pieces of silver and serve
[1:11:03.520 --> 1:11:07.440]  them. So the credit goes to God, the credit goes to you the audience because
[1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:10.760]  you are the Info War, you're not an audience, you're activist in the arena,
[1:11:10.760 --> 1:11:14.240]  you're men and women in the arena of every race, color and creed. I salute you
[1:11:14.240 --> 1:11:17.920]  because you're part of the human race and I love you. This is one hell of a time
[1:11:17.920 --> 1:11:24.080]  to be alive and I can't go anywhere on the street. It could be in New York, it
[1:11:24.080 --> 1:11:28.480]  could be in California, it could be in Dallas, Texas, it could be anywhere and
[1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:34.320]  not have half the people come over and shake my hand and say, you woke us up,
[1:11:34.320 --> 1:11:40.320]  we know it's all real now, we're not going along with it. But that's gonna
[1:11:40.320 --> 1:11:46.120]  cause on the opposite side insane levels of hatred and viciousness. So that's
[1:11:46.120 --> 1:11:48.640]  why I've committed myself into God's hands and I've said that many times but
[1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:53.800]  I'm really committed to God's hands and only God can lead God and direct me to
[1:11:53.800 --> 1:11:57.800]  not fall apart into this level of pressure and that's the only reason I'm
[1:11:57.800 --> 1:12:01.520]  able to operate is God because I have the energy and the will to fight these
[1:12:01.520 --> 1:12:06.040]  people but I'm human so it fails the way it comes out. So I'm trying to align
[1:12:06.040 --> 1:12:11.960]  myself with God and to transcend these globalist Satanists and that I forgive
[1:12:11.960 --> 1:12:15.520]  them and I feel sorry for them but I still fight them with all my vigor and
[1:12:15.520 --> 1:12:21.080]  oppose them but understand that they're the losers and they know that and
[1:12:21.080 --> 1:12:28.880]  they're desperately trying to claw us down into their anti-human, vampirist,
[1:12:28.880 --> 1:12:35.760]  child molestation world and it's our job to fight them, it's our job to expose
[1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:41.400]  them, it's our job to stand against them but to do it from a position of
[1:12:41.400 --> 1:12:46.040]  strength and clarity and focus and a lot of times I'm angry, a lot of times I'm
[1:12:46.040 --> 1:12:50.840]  branding and raving. I know that when I say this to you, I'm saying it to me but
[1:12:50.840 --> 1:12:55.040]  I want to be what King David talked about in that place, that quiet place of
[1:12:55.040 --> 1:12:58.400]  the most time where I get all the time where I understand the world and the
[1:12:58.400 --> 1:13:02.600]  universe and can see into the future just like you can do when you get in that
[1:13:02.600 --> 1:13:08.080]  high calm place with the Holy Spirit, not the comforter of the Holy Spirit, not
[1:13:08.080 --> 1:13:13.080]  the love you have with God, not the amazingness to touch infinity and how
[1:13:13.080 --> 1:13:17.880]  sublime that is, that's for babies and that's great and any of us have a
[1:13:17.880 --> 1:13:21.280]  relationship with God that's a total gift we can snap our fingers and be in
[1:13:21.280 --> 1:13:28.440]  that presence of the comforter, God being our Father but there's also the
[1:13:28.440 --> 1:13:34.080]  next level, the quiet place of the most time, in God's court, in God's presence,
[1:13:34.080 --> 1:13:40.040]  in the mission and then you stare into infinity and our enemies know we can
[1:13:40.040 --> 1:13:45.080]  stare into infinity, they know they have sold all that connection to God off for
[1:13:45.080 --> 1:13:50.480]  pathetic temporal disgusting power to where they wear festooned outfits and
[1:13:50.480 --> 1:13:55.480]  black robes and the Pope's garb and just all of this to try to make us look
[1:13:55.480 --> 1:13:59.240]  like they're separate from us on a higher plane, they are separate from us on
[1:13:59.240 --> 1:14:04.760]  another plane but it's not a higher plane close to God, it is a plane in our
[1:14:04.760 --> 1:14:10.200]  third dimensional thought below us, like the creepy crawly things that live
[1:14:10.200 --> 1:14:17.360]  under rocks and so take joy when they persecute you because that means you're
[1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:21.440]  over the target, again they didn't have radar at the start of World War II and a
[1:14:21.440 --> 1:14:24.840]  few years into they're flying the liberators and the B-17s and the planes
[1:14:24.840 --> 1:14:29.480]  into Germany and other areas to drop bombs on them, they would go towards the
[1:14:29.480 --> 1:14:32.280]  flak and the Germans wouldn't put up you know fake flak over here, they put the
[1:14:32.280 --> 1:14:35.400]  real stuff up and put the smoke in the air and all the rest of it and you so
[1:14:35.400 --> 1:14:39.240]  you're like your radar was the enemy and so you just have to kind of like in a
[1:14:39.240 --> 1:14:45.480]  fight forget about what you're doing and win it and just bear down and commit
[1:14:45.480 --> 1:14:51.800]  and flip the switch and so that's it and I flip the switch, in fact I even see
[1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:58.920]  persecution now as a blessing, I'm not a masochist or a sadomasochist but now I
[1:14:58.920 --> 1:15:03.520]  understand that I just need a fire lit under my ass and with all the things
[1:15:03.520 --> 1:15:06.640]  whatever you see going on against us that's the tip of the iceberg, I mean
[1:15:06.640 --> 1:15:11.080]  they've done things far worse to me than what you see in the news and that's okay
[1:15:11.080 --> 1:15:14.760]  because it's the strangest thing, when I was younger you'd have a deep pain in
[1:15:14.760 --> 1:15:23.520]  your heart, it was it was you didn't like it but now that pain is a strength
[1:15:23.520 --> 1:15:29.880]  ladies and gentlemen that that pain is not something that I operate off of but
[1:15:29.880 --> 1:15:35.800]  new pains are not like the even greater deep pains and so it's almost like a
[1:15:35.800 --> 1:15:41.160]  pleasure and and that's transcendence, that's transcendence and I know God's
[1:15:41.160 --> 1:15:45.400]  testing how much I can take because God doesn't give us tasks we can't take, God's
[1:15:45.400 --> 1:15:49.800]  getting me ready for even greater tasks and greater pain and so I say oh that's
[1:15:49.800 --> 1:15:55.280]  God's will, give me the pain, I want the full mission.
[1:15:58.080 --> 1:16:03.600]  Your voice counts, when you share information be it over the internet or

[1:16:07.720 --> 1:16:12.040]  unpopular, they know you're angry and now to get around big tech it's more

[1:18:01.360 --> 1:18:06.040]  a war between free individuals and nation-states on one side and the
[1:18:06.040 --> 1:18:10.240]  globalist on the other who are literally trying to create a post-human world
[1:18:10.240 --> 1:18:13.840]  for the United States of Brazil and of course triggered by the Brexit in the
[1:18:13.840 --> 1:18:18.240]  UK, nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government
[1:18:18.240 --> 1:18:22.040]  that's why they launched their great recess and their program after
[1:18:22.040 --> 1:18:28.120]  collapsing us of build back better, this is nothing more than a top-down
[1:18:28.120 --> 1:18:32.880]  vertical consolidation of the world economy because they couldn't take our
[1:18:32.880 --> 1:18:37.320]  guns because we wouldn't bow because the left which is the ideology of this
[1:18:37.320 --> 1:18:42.120]  world government system couldn't win, they released a biological weapon on us
[1:18:42.120 --> 1:18:47.400]  now we know two years ago we learned about it about 20 months ago, it's that
[1:18:47.400 --> 1:18:51.360]  simple they can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns so the global
[1:18:51.360 --> 1:18:55.480]  corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history, expose this
[1:18:55.480 --> 1:19:00.120]  paradigm and we win, people ask me Alex why did you come out with a new natural
[1:19:00.120 --> 1:19:04.680]  organic sleep aid when you already have knockout that works so well with eight
[1:19:04.680 --> 1:19:09.520]  natural ingredients, well because when you've taken a certain organic blend for
[1:19:09.520 --> 1:19:13.000]  a decade like I've taken this product I came up with it doesn't work as well
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:17.120]  anymore, that's the way herbs work, do you go off at a while, come back on it it
[1:19:17.120 --> 1:19:20.920]  works again, so what did I do I went to the developers and I said make a totally
[1:19:20.920 --> 1:19:24.600]  different formula with a lot of other known natural healthy compounds that
[1:19:24.600 --> 1:19:27.280]  make you sleep deep and restful because that's what helps your immune system and
[1:19:27.280 --> 1:19:32.080]  I want it to be at least twice as strong as knockout, okay be careful when you
[1:19:32.080 --> 1:19:36.000]  take it, it's incredibly strong, it's named down and out, I don't have time to
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:39.160]  get into all the ingredients in it but it is extremely strong and we are
[1:19:39.160 --> 1:19:43.360]  extremely proud of it, it is exclusively available at infowarstore.com

[1:20:08.160 --> 1:20:29.160]  It's Friday October 1st, Dr. Zelenko will be joining us coming up at 1 30
[1:20:29.160 --> 1:20:34.520]  central until 3 p.m. central, I'll be hosting the fourth hour with him and he's
[1:20:34.520 --> 1:20:38.760]  been calling again for Nuremberg to and for new actions against the globalist
[1:20:38.760 --> 1:20:42.520]  as the evidence is completely confirmed by the National Health Services here in
[1:20:42.520 --> 1:20:47.840]  the U.S. and the U.K. as well as in Europe that there is a 25 increase in
[1:20:47.840 --> 1:20:54.600]  Europe, the U.K. and the U.S. 25% increase in a type of heart attack in young
[1:20:54.600 --> 1:21:01.280]  people from blood blots which they said in October of last year they feared the
[1:21:01.280 --> 1:21:06.640]  so-called vaccine would cause and it's now a warning on the dam insert. Of course
[1:21:06.640 --> 1:21:09.680]  they knew this from studies previously with similar injections that would do
[1:21:09.680 --> 1:21:15.600]  this. They got a lot of nerve ladies and gentlemen and a lot of folks that don't
[1:21:15.600 --> 1:21:19.400]  die are going to die later and that's where we tell you about soft kill
[1:21:19.400 --> 1:21:22.640]  weapons. They've already done animal studies and in China human studies with
[1:21:22.640 --> 1:21:27.480]  these things before they launch them on us so they know it's going to happen
[1:21:27.480 --> 1:21:31.400]  over time and so it's not all one clear way it happens. It's like autism is
[1:21:31.400 --> 1:21:34.920]  hundreds of different types of things on the spectrum but in the studies we know
[1:21:34.920 --> 1:21:42.120]  it's the injections that along with pesticides and things that males aren't
[1:21:42.120 --> 1:21:45.520]  as strong against. Males are geared different. We have half the blood
[1:21:45.520 --> 1:21:51.320]  brain barrier of a female. Females don't reject things as easy. They can handle
[1:21:51.320 --> 1:21:55.600]  they're not physically as strong as a male in like lifting weights or fighting
[1:21:55.600 --> 1:22:00.840]  but women are stronger than males in fact in any mammal species when it comes
[1:22:00.840 --> 1:22:05.360]  to wounds and things like that because they have to grow a baby inside them.
[1:22:05.360 --> 1:22:09.840]  Women are tough. You see women doctors will tell you with ten bullet wounds
[1:22:09.840 --> 1:22:12.760]  they live. A man one bullet wouldn't want to kill them because they've been going
[1:22:12.760 --> 1:22:16.280]  to shock easier and die easier. Well it's the same thing. Boys can't handle all
[1:22:16.280 --> 1:22:20.360]  the poison women can. Women are designed to be able to take more poison than
[1:22:20.360 --> 1:22:25.160]  males but that's just a medical known fact it's not debatable and that's why
[1:22:25.160 --> 1:22:31.520]  you have nine out of ten autistic being boys. But if a girl gets enough poison
[1:22:31.520 --> 1:22:36.520]  she's autistic as well. So all of it cocktails together that's the facts and
[1:22:36.520 --> 1:22:40.840]  they've been successfully carrying that out against us with the hydrofluorosalicylic
[1:22:40.840 --> 1:22:44.680]  acid not the calcium fluoride that you do do need some of and it's good for you
[1:22:44.680 --> 1:22:49.200]  very small amount. One of the trace elements you do need a little bit of
[1:22:49.200 --> 1:22:54.680]  but you do not need hydrofluorosalicylic acid it lowers IQ and fertility and
[1:22:54.680 --> 1:22:57.600]  that's why Europe is announced and the UK. Oh we're going to Florida your
[1:22:57.600 --> 1:23:03.200]  Florida at your water too to make you submit. Speaking of submitting they have
[1:23:03.200 --> 1:23:07.560]  brought us into the incredible world of gaslighting and I watched some of this
[1:23:07.560 --> 1:23:10.960]  hearing yesterday and the crew got even more clips for me that I hadn't seen
[1:23:10.960 --> 1:23:16.520]  until this morning and these are just next level ladies and gentlemen and so
[1:23:16.520 --> 1:23:19.360]  let's just let these speak for themselves then I'll give you my take in the
[1:23:19.360 --> 1:23:23.800]  next segment. I got a little special clip from Steven Crowder's amazingly funny
[1:23:23.800 --> 1:23:28.320]  and highly produced show man I'm sitting there watching a two hour live show and
[1:23:28.320 --> 1:23:33.280]  I was part of the show for an hour and the production and the precision and they
[1:23:33.280 --> 1:23:40.000]  do it four days a week live with a small crew. It was better than Saturday Night Live
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:45.040]  and it was a crew 120 at the size simply amazing. I mean even if he was a leftist
[1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:49.480]  I'd say this guy's got incredible talent but he's not so that's why you look at
[1:23:49.480 --> 1:23:53.000]  all the aggregates and the numbers he's as big as Tucker Carlson worldwide so
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:56.480]  congratulations to Steven Crowder he just gets better and better and that makes me
[1:23:56.480 --> 1:23:59.840]  feel good at night knowing there's people like that out there but that's
[1:23:59.840 --> 1:24:03.200]  coming up next segment but let's go ahead and get to a Democrat Dems called
[1:24:03.200 --> 1:24:10.040]  Killing Babies in Womb a blessing an act of love as they protest Texas abortion
[1:24:10.040 --> 1:24:18.600]  law and let's just start with abortion activist militia AZ as we know people get
[1:24:18.600 --> 1:24:24.200]  pregnant and are not just women here it is I want to start by saying I do not
[1:24:24.200 --> 1:24:28.240]  regret either of my abortions I do regret my experience at the crisis
[1:24:28.240 --> 1:24:33.080]  pregnancy center the most traumatic part of my experience was one of those
[1:24:33.080 --> 1:24:36.720]  centers and how I was treated there and I hope that they all shut down because
[1:24:36.720 --> 1:24:42.400]  they exist to manipulate and prey on vulnerable pregnant people and I just
[1:24:42.400 --> 1:24:45.680]  wanted to acknowledge a lot of people are being left out of this conversation
[1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:50.120]  today because as we know people get pregnant and not just women but I hear
[1:24:50.120 --> 1:24:54.920]  people over and over and over again say women get pregnant but that's excluding
[1:24:54.920 --> 1:24:59.440]  people that should be a part of this conversation as for the crisis pregnancy
[1:24:59.440 --> 1:25:04.120]  center and then she goes on the same lady to reverse reality and say those that
[1:25:04.120 --> 1:25:09.520]  don't want to abort people are elitist and want to attack poor people and are
[1:25:09.520 --> 1:25:13.080]  racist I know sweetheart it's the Rockefellers and Margaret Sanger that
[1:25:13.080 --> 1:25:16.000]  think brown people are weeds that said they wanted to kill you and they set up
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:20.600]  Planned Parenthood to make sure you're never born and now since you live they
[1:25:20.600 --> 1:25:23.400]  just turned you into one of their mind control slaves to try to kill other
[1:25:23.400 --> 1:25:29.560]  people I guess you'll get rid of more babies so here it is before SBA
[1:25:29.560 --> 1:25:34.600]  officially became the law things were already dismal but now they have become
[1:25:34.600 --> 1:25:40.080]  a nightmare abortion funds have been working around the clock to help people
[1:25:40.080 --> 1:25:46.520]  access abortions with funding assistance travel support and more abortion funds
[1:25:46.520 --> 1:25:52.320]  exist to counter the discriminatory classist and racist restrictions on
[1:25:52.320 --> 1:25:58.480]  abortion like the Hyde Amendment and SB 8 the authors of SB 8 and the people
[1:25:58.480 --> 1:26:02.040]  supporting this discriminatory and despicable law have made it abundantly
[1:26:02.040 --> 1:26:07.280]  clear that they do not care about our physical and emotional well-being they
[1:26:07.280 --> 1:26:13.240]  are only interested in controlling our bodies as a survivor I know this
[1:26:13.240 --> 1:26:18.600]  feeling all too well and it fills me with rage a survivor they're all
[1:26:18.600 --> 1:26:23.000]  survivors except the babies they killed they're they're not humans there they're
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:28.400]  an act of love we got that club coming up his representative Ray Rahana saying
[1:26:28.400 --> 1:26:32.800]  it's unpatriotic for people to create false impression that Margaret Sanger
[1:26:32.800 --> 1:26:36.080]  had racist motives no she just called black people weeds that should be
[1:26:36.080 --> 1:26:41.240]  exterminated I guess that's not racist you're right here it is
[1:26:41.240 --> 1:26:48.040]  Fox suggested that this absurd suggestion that Planned Parenthood was somehow
[1:26:48.040 --> 1:26:55.800]  conceived to encourage abortions in the African-American community I suggest
[1:26:55.800 --> 1:27:01.520]  reading an eighth grade history book is as a starter first of all abortion wasn't
[1:27:01.520 --> 1:27:09.280]  even legal when Planned Parenthood out there in the 1930s and 1919 originally
[1:27:09.280 --> 1:27:15.080]  it was founded to encourage birth control it was birth yet no they were
[1:27:15.080 --> 1:27:18.160]  doing forced abortions and sterilizations of poor blacks and whites all
[1:27:18.160 --> 1:27:22.960]  over Europe all over the UK and all over the US and Mexico he just thinks you're
[1:27:22.960 --> 1:27:27.680]  dumb there's whole books films on it the Nazis use Margaret Sanger's books and
[1:27:27.680 --> 1:27:33.320]  writings as their defense in the Nuremberg trials go back to it place it
[1:27:33.320 --> 1:27:38.080]  Sanger and W.E.B. Du Bois one of the great civil rights leader was an
[1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:43.520]  advisor to Sanger so and a communist it's possible to pack it up yeah and she
[1:27:43.520 --> 1:27:47.080]  says in her letters to the different foundations like a Rockefeller's I need
[1:27:47.080 --> 1:27:51.160]  money to hire and groom and prepare blacks to go in and help us get rid of
[1:27:51.160 --> 1:27:59.280]  the weeds Du Bois was a communist good let's all admit it but see her name has
[1:27:59.280 --> 1:28:03.400]  now been dropped by New York City Clinic over eugenics even ABC News but this guy
[1:28:03.400 --> 1:28:07.360]  because he's got brown skin he can now resuscitate a Hitler lover here it is
[1:28:07.360 --> 1:28:13.240]  boys one of the great civil rights leader was an advisor to Sanger so you
[1:28:13.240 --> 1:28:17.880]  know it's fine to have ideological differences but it is really sad that
[1:28:17.880 --> 1:28:22.720]  people are saying things that are in misreading of American history frankly
[1:28:22.720 --> 1:28:27.520]  pretty unpatriotic that you don't take the time to read American history yeah
[1:28:27.520 --> 1:28:31.120]  that's gaslighting if we read American history we know all about it buddy and
[1:28:31.120 --> 1:28:35.280]  we know that you're a big fat liar incredible absolutely amazing gas
[1:28:35.280 --> 1:28:38.880]  lighting I mean that's like saying the Sun does not rise in the morning and
[1:28:38.880 --> 1:28:44.800]  set in the evening it's not yellow it won't burn your skin waters not wet they
[1:28:44.800 --> 1:28:50.200]  just lie lie because they're pissed it's coming out who they are the left of the
[1:28:50.200 --> 1:28:54.040]  people that created Hitler Hitler was a leftist the Rockefeller's created
[1:28:54.040 --> 1:28:57.680]  Goldsprings Harbor and then the Nazis attention radio listeners if you're
[1:28:57.680 --> 1:29:02.640]  concerned about the coming chaos after the November elections this will be an
[1:29:02.640 --> 1:29:07.040]  extremely important message here's why no matter what the outcome in November
[1:29:07.040 --> 1:29:13.000]  catastrophic social upheaval is a very real possibility here's why this is
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:17.440]  important listen we all know that silver and gold have been historic hedges
[1:29:17.440 --> 1:29:22.440]  against the uncertain waves of social chaos and unstable currencies but did
[1:29:22.440 --> 1:29:26.800]  you know that there's been times in the past during times of extreme hardship
[1:29:26.800 --> 1:29:31.320]  when Americans put another store of value above even silver and gold it's
[1:29:31.320 --> 1:29:36.400]  true open pollinated seeds have been and could very well be the ultimate store of

[1:32:11.840 --> 1:32:16.840]  then you really look at health outcomes for a long period of time not four weeks

[1:33:46.120 --> 1:33:51.760]  spreading our articles our videos our reports and here it is I learned about
[1:33:51.760 --> 1:33:55.640]  this yesterday and I said Norm Pattis one of the top lawyers in the country
[1:33:55.640 --> 1:34:00.040]  criminal lawyer civil lawyer first amendment lawyer you know right there
[1:34:00.040 --> 1:34:04.000]  up at the Alan Dershowitz level right there at the Jerry Spence level actually
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:09.880]  represents Mr. Spence New York health workers win religious exemption to
[1:34:09.880 --> 1:34:14.800]  vaccine mandate Bloomberg breaking last night but you don't hear about this and
[1:34:14.800 --> 1:34:21.040]  so that's what's going on that's what's unfolding and Norm Pattis joins us now
[1:34:21.040 --> 1:34:25.600]  my lawyer in the first amendment as well to break down what's happening so
[1:34:25.600 --> 1:34:30.640]  you're just a very busy man I'm glad you did this tell us the current
[1:34:30.640 --> 1:34:35.320]  information on what's going on so New York passed a register a piece of
[1:34:35.320 --> 1:34:39.040]  legislation without really a regulation rather without notice or comment
[1:34:39.040 --> 1:34:45.360]  requiring that all health care workers gum get vaccinated and it permitted a
[1:34:45.360 --> 1:34:50.560]  health related or a medical exemption but no religious exemption and so we
[1:34:50.560 --> 1:34:55.240]  challenged that in the eastern district of New York federal court in Brooklyn the
[1:34:55.240 --> 1:34:59.520]  judge threw us out within an hour of the paper being filed so we went to the
[1:34:59.520 --> 1:35:02.480]  federal appellate court the United States Court of Appeals for the Second
[1:35:02.480 --> 1:35:07.120]  Circuit in New York City one step below the Supreme Court and we asked for an
[1:35:07.120 --> 1:35:12.360]  emergency stay an order blocking imposition of that regulation because
[1:35:12.360 --> 1:35:17.640]  it disadvantaged people of faith and the appellate court gave us an emergency
[1:35:17.640 --> 1:35:22.400]  stay it granted that yesterday afternoon now we will go to a full merits
[1:35:22.400 --> 1:35:26.160]  briefing and we'll have arguments on October 14th on the issue but here's
[1:35:26.160 --> 1:35:30.880]  what's at stake when evaluating a government action that burdens the
[1:35:30.880 --> 1:35:34.920]  first amendment the courts use what's called a strict scrutiny test in other
[1:35:34.920 --> 1:35:38.360]  words does the government have a compelling interest in doing what it did
[1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:42.800]  and if it does have a compelling interest is the remedy that it offers
[1:35:42.800 --> 1:35:47.320]  narrowly tailored to accomplishing that we acknowledge the compelling interest
[1:35:47.320 --> 1:35:52.000]  in public health but we say it makes absolutely no sense to say that religious
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:56.200]  people can't be exempt from the vaccine while people with medical reasons can
[1:35:56.200 --> 1:36:01.160]  the virus doesn't care how it hops from person to person a person with a medical
[1:36:01.160 --> 1:36:04.400]  exemption can go to work why shouldn't religious people be able to go to work
[1:36:04.400 --> 1:36:08.680]  and so we had a number of clients approach us who were people of faith and
[1:36:08.680 --> 1:36:12.400]  believe that they would lose their job under this exemption so we are
[1:36:12.400 --> 1:36:17.680]  challenging this as a as a misapplication and violation frankly of the
[1:36:17.680 --> 1:36:21.320]  first amendment in a misapplication to the state's police power in other words
[1:36:21.320 --> 1:36:25.840]  New York overreached and here's a chilling example of what's at stake
[1:36:25.840 --> 1:36:30.800]  governor Huckle the unelected mayor of New York City who replaced governor
[1:36:30.800 --> 1:36:36.160]  Cuomo when he resigned said earlier in the week look God wants you to get
[1:36:36.160 --> 1:36:41.960]  vaccine vaccinated rather be a good apostle get vaccinated my view is that is
[1:36:41.960 --> 1:36:46.280]  breathtaking arrogance on behalf of the is it that an attempt to establish state
[1:36:46.280 --> 1:36:50.080]  run religion and violation of the first amendment I don't know what it is it
[1:36:50.080 --> 1:36:54.320]  sounds just crazy to me I don't want my governor or my elected officials telling
[1:36:54.320 --> 1:36:57.880]  me they've talked to God and God tells me what to do it sounds like a science
[1:36:57.880 --> 1:37:01.280]  fiction movie we're like a crazy woman's like we will all take the injection but
[1:37:01.280 --> 1:37:05.280]  those that don't are not listening to God we must go out and confront them I
[1:37:05.280 --> 1:37:11.840]  mean this is like I'm watching an old 1980s horror movie there's a lot going on
[1:37:11.840 --> 1:37:14.600]  in New England Alex let me tell you what's going on in Connecticut you if
[1:37:14.600 --> 1:37:18.320]  you think governor Huckle is crazy wait till you hear what Ned Lamont is doing
[1:37:18.320 --> 1:37:24.080]  there's a new mandate that requires state employees to get vaccinated if they
[1:37:24.080 --> 1:37:27.760]  don't they can be fired as early as midnight Monday the governor in
[1:37:27.760 --> 1:37:32.680]  Connecticut is mobilizing the National Guard to fill the position of state
[1:37:32.680 --> 1:37:37.320]  workers who are discharged as a result of not getting vaccinated we have an
[1:37:37.320 --> 1:37:41.600]  enormous and long tradition in this country of suspicion of militant of the
[1:37:41.600 --> 1:37:45.280]  military we didn't want a permanent military at the time of the founding we
[1:37:45.280 --> 1:37:49.800]  always have prided ourselves on civilian rule I can't believe that in my home
[1:37:49.800 --> 1:37:54.520]  state of Connecticut my governor is prepared to put men in uniform on school
[1:37:54.520 --> 1:37:59.080]  buses presumably bearing sidearms to drive our kids around if this happened in
[1:37:59.080 --> 1:38:02.760]  a third-world country we'd call it a coup what do you want to call it in the
[1:38:02.760 --> 1:38:06.760]  United States so we've got a governor in Connecticut prepared to mobilize the
[1:38:06.760 --> 1:38:11.160]  military to replace people state workers who don't get vaccinated and we've got a
[1:38:11.160 --> 1:38:14.680]  governor in New York who says she's talked to God and God knows what we
[1:38:14.680 --> 1:38:18.720]  should do what happened to the Constitution what happened to the Bill
[1:38:18.720 --> 1:38:23.440]  of Rights so we're thrilled by the Second Circuit's decision this week to put a
[1:38:23.440 --> 1:38:28.160]  stay that is to block imposition of New York's regulation we're hopeful that
[1:38:28.160 --> 1:38:33.040]  we'll be able to win it when it's argued on its merits on the on the 14th of
[1:38:33.040 --> 1:38:37.040]  October if we don't we're going to the United States Supreme Court because we
[1:38:37.040 --> 1:38:41.000]  are established in this country our government has been established subject
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:44.680]  to limitations on the Bill of Rights my office and I think the people of the
[1:38:44.680 --> 1:38:48.800]  United States are proud to stand with Antigone the protagonist in
[1:38:48.800 --> 1:38:54.080]  Sophocles play by that name when she refused to obey the king who would not
[1:38:54.080 --> 1:38:57.640]  let her bury her brother because her brother was killed or executed as a
[1:38:57.640 --> 1:39:02.720]  result of treason she said there are laws higher than yours king and I choose
[1:39:02.720 --> 1:39:07.360]  to obey those laws I think the United States is it as a country of people free
[1:39:07.360 --> 1:39:11.080]  to follow their conscience and when government tries to tell you what you've
[1:39:11.080 --> 1:39:16.680]  got to do in violation of fundamental rights you we we the people need to fight
[1:39:16.680 --> 1:39:20.960]  norm that's right there is a higher law that's written on our hearts and when we
[1:39:20.960 --> 1:39:25.680]  betray that we betray ourselves I think you're dead right and that's what's at
[1:39:25.680 --> 1:39:29.640]  stake I mean there's an emerging you know the people say sometimes they give
[1:39:29.640 --> 1:39:32.360]  me a hard time why are you fighting vaccines what do you want everybody to
[1:39:32.360 --> 1:39:36.560]  die of course I don't but what I don't want to what I worry about is the
[1:39:36.560 --> 1:39:40.720]  precedent these laws set you know we're creating a new nanny state a new
[1:39:40.720 --> 1:39:44.400]  public health state that will can and will be able to do anything in the name
[1:39:44.400 --> 1:39:47.760]  of public health in the name of an emergency so today it's a pandemic
[1:39:47.760 --> 1:39:51.840]  tomorrow it's guns and we saw the CDC come out this week again with more
[1:39:51.840 --> 1:39:55.680]  information and belief about gun violence then it's good so that's the second
[1:39:55.680 --> 1:39:59.720]  amendment then we're going to have claims about systemic racism as a public
[1:39:59.720 --> 1:40:04.200]  health crisis then we're going to have claims about global climate changes of
[1:40:04.200 --> 1:40:07.920]  public health crisis when everything becomes a public health crisis and
[1:40:07.920 --> 1:40:12.000]  somebody says we've got to act in the common good that somebody is usually
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:16.800]  somebody in government who had and let's expand on that we then have
[1:40:16.800 --> 1:40:21.400]  operation lockstep from the Rockefeller Foundation that literally funded Hitler
[1:40:21.400 --> 1:40:26.520]  literally created the UN literally created the new policy for the lockdowns
[1:40:26.520 --> 1:40:30.360]  worldwide that's public that controls Biden's national response a private
[1:40:30.360 --> 1:40:36.600]  foundation of a eugenics social Darwinistic family they are now in
[1:40:36.600 --> 1:40:41.680]  control of this whole thing and in their operation lockstep from 2011 they
[1:40:41.680 --> 1:40:45.760]  describe using the fear of a virus for everything that's now transpired we're
[1:40:45.760 --> 1:40:50.360]  facing a battle plan I think we are and you know I mean you know you know I
[1:40:50.360 --> 1:40:53.600]  hear you talk about globalism and sometimes I understand you sometimes I
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:40:59.520]  don't here's what I think I'm here and that is that there are elites who have
[1:40:59.520 --> 1:41:03.080]  a vision of the common good and they seek to impose that on us in the name of
[1:41:03.080 --> 1:41:06.640]  survival or furthering the species somehow they're going to be captains of
[1:41:06.640 --> 1:41:10.920]  the Darwinian engine as they see it the struggle for human significance for
[1:41:10.920 --> 1:41:15.320]  liberty for a meaningful life is based on an individual by individual basis I
[1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:19.000]  live in a small community I want to be able to set the meats and bounds of what
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:23.280]  I can and cannot do government helps me with that but I don't want government I
[1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:27.200]  don't want global government I don't want global elites setting norms that I am
[1:41:27.200 --> 1:41:32.320]  required to adhere to or I'll lose my job my liberty my own exactly they cared
[1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:36.000]  about us the top-down implementation would put in a tyranny where their
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:39.440]  minions could have used us and you surface and they always do but this is
[1:41:39.440 --> 1:41:44.040]  done from the position of depopulation and world government to carry that out
[1:41:44.040 --> 1:41:48.360]  so it's designed to be a dystopia that's why they're gaslighting us now with this
[1:41:48.360 --> 1:41:52.960]  dystopia well I'll tell you you know I've read a lot of dystopia utopian
[1:41:52.960 --> 1:41:56.960]  literature dystopian literature this year re-readed 1984 eldest Huxley's
[1:41:56.960 --> 1:42:00.840]  Brave New World you know the Handmaid's Tale by Edward and the protagonist in
[1:42:00.840 --> 1:42:04.200]  each of these books is usually an individual with application of good
[1:42:04.200 --> 1:42:09.240]  old common sense says this doesn't make sense I resist I want to have
[1:42:09.240 --> 1:42:13.560]  significance on my own terms and they undermine the lore they undermine the
[1:42:13.560 --> 1:42:16.440]  elite they undermine authority in the name of individual liberty and
[1:42:16.440 --> 1:42:20.600]  significance what I appreciate so much about info wars is that's what you're
[1:42:20.600 --> 1:42:25.440]  encouraging your listeners to do find one another speak out act out and don't
[1:42:25.440 --> 1:42:29.800]  take an order from a distant elite as an answer all right I don't want to get in
[1:42:29.800 --> 1:42:34.200]  to the crucifixion of the First Amendment that you talked about in the
[1:42:34.200 --> 1:42:37.680]  letter you posted info wars last night with this ruling but I do want to come
[1:42:37.680 --> 1:42:41.200]  back in general and talk about the weaponization of the judiciary and how
[1:42:41.200 --> 1:42:44.760]  it's mainly coming from the left and how you think as a rule we as citizens
[1:42:44.760 --> 1:42:50.080]  should oppose that with every legal lawful means and then at what point is
[1:42:50.080 --> 1:42:53.480]  it time for the new Declaration of Independence we'll be right back with
[1:42:53.480 --> 1:43:02.920]  norm paddice the COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience a symbol of
[1:43:02.920 --> 1:43:08.600]  slavery a symbol of the chains that the medical tyranny combine controlled by
[1:43:08.600 --> 1:43:13.960]  the global private corporations has put in place it is the symbol of the
[1:43:13.960 --> 1:43:18.720]  permanent emergency from which we will never emerge it is the symbol that we
[1:43:18.720 --> 1:43:23.880]  are diseased and evil and bad must cover our diseased criminal faces from the
[1:43:23.880 --> 1:43:32.440]  light of the sun it is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to
[1:43:32.440 --> 1:43:38.680]  evil ladies and gentlemen we are crossing the rubicon now the entire
[1:43:38.680 --> 1:43:43.000]  future destiny of humanity is upon us cloth swab in the you and admit they're

[1:45:02.080 --> 1:45:09.120]  left or right issue this is a global corporate agenda 21 and 2030 great reset
[1:45:09.120 --> 1:45:16.360]  takeover this is a technocracy but very few leaders Orban, Bolsonaro and just a
[1:45:16.360 --> 1:45:22.640]  few others are addressing it for what it is to their people a foreign anti-human
[1:45:22.640 --> 1:45:28.600]  anti-family anti-god takeover of the very biological system of humans this is
[1:45:28.600 --> 1:45:33.200]  a corporate takeover of our bodies of ourselves with the world ID the medical
[1:45:33.200 --> 1:45:37.440]  tracking system that'll be tied to the carbon taxes it's all been announced it
[1:45:37.440 --> 1:45:42.480]  is a dystopic nightmare and humanity is starting to organize but our leaders
[1:45:42.480 --> 1:45:46.920]  aren't we need senator Paul and senator Holly and others that have shown some
[1:45:46.920 --> 1:45:51.320]  understanding of this and senator Cruz to organize against this foreign
[1:45:51.320 --> 1:45:55.920]  multinational corporate takeover through big pharma big banks and big tech or we
[1:45:55.920 --> 1:46:00.640]  have no hope and in addition we were really finding that we were stressing
[1:46:00.640 --> 1:46:04.600]  the cardiopulmonary systems of these employees because when you cover the
[1:46:04.600 --> 1:46:08.720]  mouth and nose and you exert physical energy during your work during your
[1:46:08.720 --> 1:46:12.600]  tasks whatever it might be you're really stressing the cardiopulmonary system
[1:46:12.600 --> 1:46:16.120]  because you change the way that you breathe you have to forcibly inhale and
[1:46:16.120 --> 1:46:21.640]  forcibly exhale that taxes the heart it taxes the lungs and we have given people
[1:46:21.640 --> 1:46:26.480]  heart attacks by allowing them to work with their mouth and nose covered with
[1:46:26.480 --> 1:46:32.920]  absolutely no regulation no oversight no medical oversight the globalist have
[1:46:32.920 --> 1:46:36.600]  told us we're a disease they've told us they want to eradicate us and all the
[1:46:36.600 --> 1:46:40.320]  studies show that when you wear these masks it lowers your oxygen level up to
[1:46:40.320 --> 1:46:45.440]  one-third and gives you dangerous levels of carbon dioxide poisoning this is a
[1:46:45.440 --> 1:46:49.280]  sick cult and we've got to say no but the only way the real science because
[1:46:49.280 --> 1:46:54.680]  the public is if we tell them get your copy today of covenland and expose them
[1:46:54.680 --> 1:46:58.600]  it's covenland.com go there now
[1:46:58.600 --> 1:47:25.600]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:47:28.600 --> 1:47:51.200]  we're gonna have to change it on the inside of ourselves then change the
[1:47:51.200 --> 1:47:55.040]  outside of the world our past has got to go to a very important meeting it's
[1:47:55.040 --> 1:47:59.160]  leaving us in just about four minutes norm just in general I mean you see
[1:47:59.160 --> 1:48:02.920]  yourself I guess as a classical liberal but that means something different today
[1:48:02.920 --> 1:48:05.640]  than what liberals are today I mean I'm not putting words your mouth we talk
[1:48:05.640 --> 1:48:09.320]  about all the time what do you see in the judiciary in the executive just
[1:48:09.320 --> 1:48:13.960]  everywhere is I see a race towards classical tyranny with a high-tech
[1:48:13.960 --> 1:48:19.920]  gravy well I think the high-tech gravy I certainly see and I see people
[1:48:19.920 --> 1:48:25.040]  increasingly detached frustrating frustrated and feeling disenfranchised so
[1:48:25.040 --> 1:48:28.200]  the courts for example have regarded themselves largely immune from
[1:48:28.200 --> 1:48:33.040]  criticism they've created immunities for public officials so-called qualified
[1:48:33.040 --> 1:48:37.520]  immunities in policing they've imported immunities into the Constitution that
[1:48:37.520 --> 1:48:41.800]  don't exist and so while the preamble to the Constitution say says that we the
[1:48:41.800 --> 1:48:45.280]  people created government to ensure peace and prosperity and domestic
[1:48:45.280 --> 1:48:49.000]  tranquility the fact of the matter is many of us feel disenfranchised
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:53.880]  alienated and disconnected from the world at large you know some states
[1:48:53.880 --> 1:48:57.880]  elect judges I know they elect them down in Texas I think that's a horrible
[1:48:57.880 --> 1:49:01.520]  idea because then you get judges racing to the bottom and pandering to the
[1:49:01.520 --> 1:49:06.040]  lowest common denominator to get George Soros has put in all the new judges in
[1:49:06.040 --> 1:49:10.360]  Travis County put in the city attorney the county attorney and they're
[1:49:10.360 --> 1:49:16.400]  literally bomb-throwing maniacs well to the Travis County they out of sell it to
[1:49:16.400 --> 1:49:21.480]  Northern California and let Texans be Texas you know I elected judges are a
[1:49:21.480 --> 1:49:25.800]  horrible idea I think lifetime appointments and the federal courts are
[1:49:25.800 --> 1:49:29.360]  good but then you know you get people who are insulated so I think
[1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:32.760]  institutions aren't the answer political culture is the answer and we don't
[1:49:32.760 --> 1:49:36.720]  foster a sense of responsibility anymore the United States I agree so how do we
[1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:41.640]  declare a new 1776 that's nonviolent a new Declaration of Independence I think
[1:49:41.640 --> 1:49:44.240]  I think you ought to write a new Declaration of Independence I think I
[1:49:44.240 --> 1:49:48.200]  should write I think all our good thinkers Joe Rogan Stephen Crowder I
[1:49:48.200 --> 1:49:50.720]  think everybody should write a Declaration of Independence we should
[1:49:50.720 --> 1:49:56.360]  have a big conference and they have a million voters and see who votes in the
[1:49:56.360 --> 1:50:00.280]  new Declaration of Independence and then we all digitally sign it that's an
[1:50:00.280 --> 1:50:03.480]  excellent idea you should call a constitutional convention I mean let's
[1:50:03.480 --> 1:50:06.560]  not forget for a moment that at the founding of this country the articles
[1:50:06.560 --> 1:50:10.200]  of Confederation weren't working people met in Philadelphia to amend the
[1:50:10.200 --> 1:50:13.840]  articles of Confederation but they revolted they did something beyond what
[1:50:13.840 --> 1:50:18.920]  was called for and they created a new constitution a new republic maybe it's
[1:50:18.920 --> 1:50:23.600]  time to pour some new wine into the old skins here and see how we had liberal
[1:50:23.600 --> 1:50:27.400]  conservative top lawyers that are pro-america and Joe Rogan and Stephen
[1:50:27.400 --> 1:50:31.680]  Crowder and a bunch of scientists and myself and you know have maybe 500 top
[1:50:31.680 --> 1:50:36.800]  people there and have our new constitutional convention and then put
[1:50:36.800 --> 1:50:39.840]  it out to everybody to vote on it boy I think that would really scare the
[1:50:39.840 --> 1:50:43.560]  establishment norm because it's just a declaration of will that we the people
[1:50:43.560 --> 1:50:48.240]  don't agree with the system call the convention I'll appear if invited I
[1:50:48.240 --> 1:50:52.440]  think it's an excellent idea legitimacy springs from the bottom up not the top
[1:50:52.440 --> 1:50:56.480]  down and when it's tried to cram down on the people they resist so let's strike
[1:50:56.480 --> 1:51:00.400]  back with the pen let's strike back with expressions of popular will and let's
[1:51:00.400 --> 1:51:04.640]  recreate the republic it happened 200 some years ago it can happen again I
[1:51:04.640 --> 1:51:08.040]  agree one minute now you gotta go without getting into the stuff of Texas we
[1:51:08.040 --> 1:51:12.560]  will later as it's it's really sad but also comical the same time in my view
[1:51:12.560 --> 1:51:17.280]  what do you make of in Australia they say back when it was a penal colony that
[1:51:17.280 --> 1:51:19.880]  they still had juries is that was the British common law but they would put
[1:51:19.880 --> 1:51:23.040]  kangaroos on them I guess call that a kangaroo court with the judges really
[1:51:23.040 --> 1:51:26.440]  there but as you know a rigged jury is the term kangaroo court what is it when
[1:51:26.440 --> 1:51:30.560]  the judge just gets rid of the jury entirely even the Huffington Post when
[1:51:30.560 --> 1:51:35.320]  it broke that story about me yesterday said this is really a legal myth and you
[1:51:35.320 --> 1:51:39.080]  know doesn't really ever apply if someone actually shows up to court I think
[1:51:39.080 --> 1:51:42.440]  it's like if you just run off and never show up you can have a default this is a
[1:51:42.440 --> 1:51:48.880]  pretty big power grab my view the Leo scholars write about the vanishing trial
[1:51:48.880 --> 1:51:52.400]  the extent to which it becomes increasingly more difficult for
[1:51:52.400 --> 1:51:56.440]  ordinary people to have ordinary jurors here they're dispute judges have a lot
[1:51:56.440 --> 1:52:00.960]  of power to decide questions of law before they get to a jury and maybe we
[1:52:00.960 --> 1:52:04.160]  need to limit that maybe that's one of the things you are new constitutional
[1:52:04.160 --> 1:52:08.440]  convention will say and that is there are explicit limits if power flows from
[1:52:08.440 --> 1:52:12.520]  the people we want jurors as the people's voice deciding not just legal issue or
[1:52:12.520 --> 1:52:16.440]  factual issues but legal issues well let's just say it you've been doing a lot
[1:52:16.440 --> 1:52:20.320]  of stuff and you've been feeling really really good about these and they know
[1:52:20.320 --> 1:52:23.200]  they don't have the case they claim so I don't get to have a jury I don't think
[1:52:23.200 --> 1:52:27.800]  America is gonna put up with that I hope you're right but I think we have so
[1:52:27.800 --> 1:52:31.360]  far I think it's time for we the people to stand up and say we're mad as Helen
[1:52:31.360 --> 1:52:34.600]  we're not gonna take it anymore norm paddice of norm paddice calm and you do

[2:00:37.320 --> 2:00:41.120]  Crowder coming up and then we've got just a bunch of other news I'm gonna hit
[2:00:41.120 --> 2:00:44.600]  here geopolitical news, police state news, attempts to take us off the air
[2:00:44.600 --> 2:00:49.120]  news it's all coming up but first let's go ahead and dig into this I got to a
[2:00:49.120 --> 2:00:52.040]  lot of these but let's get to some more of these clips we already played
[2:00:52.040 --> 2:00:57.520]  representatives from Congress saying Margaret Singer is good and basically is
[2:00:57.520 --> 2:01:03.200]  an anti-racist that's what Hitler loves Jews or the KKK loves black people
[2:01:03.200 --> 2:01:09.600]  here's Dr. Gizela Mosadi abortion is a blessing let's play that clip
[2:01:09.600 --> 2:01:15.920]  abortion is a blessing it's an act of love here it is SPA has not only caused
[2:01:15.920 --> 2:01:20.840]  a near total abortion ban in Texas it has made it extremely dangerous to be
[2:01:20.840 --> 2:01:26.840]  pregnant in Texas where our maternal morbidity and mortality rate is already
[2:01:26.840 --> 2:01:31.880]  unconscionably high especially for black women and pregnant people of color
[2:01:31.880 --> 2:01:38.880]  Texas deserves better I know firsthand that abortion saves lives for the
[2:01:38.880 --> 2:01:43.480]  thousands of people I've cared for abortion is a blessing abortion is an
[2:01:43.480 --> 2:01:48.960]  act of love abortion is freedom we need federal protection now we need laws that
[2:01:48.960 --> 2:01:52.840]  elevate science and evidence and recognize the dignity and autonomy of
[2:01:52.840 --> 2:01:58.480]  people accessing care of killing babies woman's health here's the next one this
[2:01:58.480 --> 2:02:03.720]  is representative Jackie Speller abortion is safer than childbirth well
[2:02:03.720 --> 2:02:09.160]  it's not safe for the baby here it is into a 2018 report by the National
[2:02:09.160 --> 2:02:14.680]  Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine abortion is safer than
[2:02:14.680 --> 2:02:20.680]  childbirth colonoscopies dental procedures plastic surgery herbal and
[2:02:20.680 --> 2:02:25.040]  tonsillectomies and yet the facilities that provide that's because the Planned
[2:02:25.040 --> 2:02:29.360]  Parenthood does 90% of them and doesn't report it back because they're a criminal
[2:02:29.360 --> 2:02:33.880]  organization let's continue and yet facilities that provide abortion care
[2:02:33.880 --> 2:02:37.880]  are more likely to be subjected to medically unnecessary politically
[2:02:37.880 --> 2:02:43.280]  motivated regulations that only make it more difficult to provide abortion
[2:02:43.280 --> 2:02:47.840]  services have you encountered such targeted regulations of abortion
[2:02:47.840 --> 2:02:54.240]  providers where you practice and if so how has it affected you and again ladies
[2:02:54.240 --> 2:02:57.240]  and gentlemen they also don't tell you there's a bunch of studies out where
[2:02:57.240 --> 2:03:00.480]  you're double some studies say triple they all say it increases when a woman
[2:03:00.480 --> 2:03:03.680]  has abortions right judging women that have done it we understand you get
[2:03:03.680 --> 2:03:07.480]  roped into it it happens I've been involved in it I've repented we if you
[2:03:07.480 --> 2:03:11.720]  weren't consciously doing it as a Satan it's like they do God forgives you like
[2:03:11.720 --> 2:03:15.640]  I admit I paid for abortions back when I was younger and I repented of it and the
[2:03:15.640 --> 2:03:19.480]  media goes look he admits he's a hypocrite no I changed my mind I decided I
[2:03:19.480 --> 2:03:26.400]  was wrong and God touched my heart and I was I finally got you know didn't get
[2:03:26.400 --> 2:03:29.440]  religion in some church or on TV I just got touched my heart to really be a
[2:03:29.440 --> 2:03:34.120]  good person and and then for years I didn't even you know date or anything

[2:06:15.400 --> 2:06:20.400]  harping on war we got some really big COVID news I'm gonna hit next segment
[2:06:20.400 --> 2:06:25.000]  just broken then we got doctors Alenco joining us coming up and I'm probably
[2:06:25.000 --> 2:06:27.600]  even open the phones up in the last half is interviewed we'll be with us for an
[2:06:27.600 --> 2:06:31.440]  hour and a half here on the Alex Jones show thank you so much for joining us
[2:06:31.440 --> 2:06:38.880]  but let me play something from Stephen Crowder's program he does two hours a
[2:06:38.880 --> 2:06:43.760]  day Monday through Thursday and watching the professionalism watching his
[2:06:43.760 --> 2:06:52.120]  small crew do 95% of the show live is incredible but I got to be in one of the
[2:06:52.120 --> 2:06:55.720]  parts that is produced so they asked me to be there at 7 30 the morning we get
[2:06:55.720 --> 2:07:00.200]  there I go in do a couple take shoot my little piece they go in shoot their
[2:07:00.200 --> 2:07:06.520]  piece and by the time the show starts at 9 they've got the piece ready and by 9
[2:07:06.520 --> 2:07:11.920]  20 it airs and that was like two people working on that and then they go and they
[2:07:11.920 --> 2:07:18.560]  host on the show so just I mean Stephen Crowder I was on a show in studio a year
[2:07:18.560 --> 2:07:21.400]  ago or so and it was it was good but he's getting better it was already
[2:07:21.400 --> 2:07:26.000]  amazing this was like and I'm not kissing Crowder's ass I am impressed I'm
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:30.120]  impressed how young Jamie on Joe Rogan show runs the whole thing by himself
[2:07:30.120 --> 2:07:33.880]  whole thing they got a guy you don't get coffee or whatever let people in the
[2:07:33.880 --> 2:07:39.040]  door and a couple of you know veterans as guardians but that's what's going on
[2:07:39.040 --> 2:07:43.560]  around Joe but I mean and Joe does a great job this was amazing and you know
[2:07:43.560 --> 2:07:48.000]  there's one way to fight that's really serious and other ways with with humor
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:52.720]  but all over the country in leftist control areas and also the UK they're
[2:07:52.720 --> 2:07:59.000]  letting biological men demand pap smears demand cervical examinations that
[2:07:59.000 --> 2:08:04.520]  don't exist that'd be like you know pulling up in your Ford F-150 car that's
[2:08:04.520 --> 2:08:08.600]  an eight-cylinder and saying I want you to work on the my airplane that has a
[2:08:08.600 --> 2:08:12.680]  jet engine they go that's a that's not an airplane that's an F-150 eight-cylinder
[2:08:12.680 --> 2:08:19.160]  gasoline engine made in Dearborn Mission they're like no that's a F-16 fighter
[2:08:19.160 --> 2:08:23.440]  jet and you're supposed to go well let's go and work on those wheels in the
[2:08:23.440 --> 2:08:27.680]  engine and then get in the cockpit we were flying around but they have laws
[2:08:27.680 --> 2:08:31.520]  passing the UK in here that they'll arrest your ass and I actually start to do
[2:08:31.520 --> 2:08:35.760]  it if you say hey dude you're like a six foot four dude from prison beating
[2:08:35.760 --> 2:08:42.040]  people up and breaking things in a convenience store because someone called
[2:08:42.040 --> 2:08:50.200]  you hey man come on up it's not man it's ma'am this is all the mental illness
[2:08:50.200 --> 2:08:54.560]  where if you'll accept this from the Stockholm syndrome program that they
[2:08:54.560 --> 2:08:58.120]  run of the Tabas Talk Institute that's where all this came from you'll accept
[2:08:58.120 --> 2:09:02.720]  anything well I don't accept it because I hate people that they want to be a
[2:09:02.720 --> 2:09:08.240]  different sex there I hate no no I'm saying it's the cult of giving up who
[2:09:08.240 --> 2:09:11.840]  we are to become something else then the system manages that transhumanism
[2:09:11.840 --> 2:09:18.640]  that's what I'm saying the extreme end of it is so here's their buildup of what's
[2:09:18.640 --> 2:09:22.240]  happening it actually went longer this one only play part of it describing all
[2:09:22.240 --> 2:09:26.920]  the insanity in the prisons where two women have a baby and they give them
[2:09:26.920 --> 2:09:35.480]  condoms now because you know women have male members here it is okay are we
[2:09:35.480 --> 2:09:40.200]  ready I don't know that I'm ever ready I don't know that we want to be women's
[2:09:40.200 --> 2:09:44.480]  liberation front I already hate this yeah the worst reported at least one
[2:09:44.480 --> 2:09:49.600]  woman at the central California women's facility was pregnant after a male
[2:09:49.600 --> 2:09:54.680]  transgender male prisoner okay was transferred there keep in mind the male
[2:09:54.680 --> 2:09:59.120]  prisoner was permitted to transfer under the new California law SB 132 which
[2:09:59.120 --> 2:10:02.880]  allows biological males we're not supposed to use a term biological males
[2:10:02.880 --> 2:10:07.400]  now what's the term person with penis or person yes no it's it's something else
[2:10:07.400 --> 2:10:20.120]  may lady mcbulls I heard but I had read at Vox that it's hateful to say
[2:10:20.120 --> 2:10:23.560]  biological males so I don't know they're a different term like Latinx go say go
[2:10:23.560 --> 2:10:26.720]  say that to the Latin king see how it turns out yeah let us know what the term
[2:10:26.720 --> 2:10:30.080]  isn't sooner or later someone's getting nine teardrop tattoos they just look
[2:10:30.080 --> 2:10:35.840]  like heroes used to colon dead yeah so under SB 132 it allows biological males
[2:10:35.840 --> 2:10:41.640]  to use women's locker rooms homo shelters and prisons to the good thing to
[2:10:41.640 --> 2:10:46.080]  the point that now condoms have been issued within the prison yeah this is
[2:10:46.080 --> 2:10:51.040]  part of the protocol to ensure that sex between inmates which is illegal by the
[2:10:51.040 --> 2:10:55.000]  way yeah would be safe so they need to make sure that it's safe sex in a in an
[2:10:55.000 --> 2:11:04.680]  all-female's prison wow where they cannot get pregnant and so all women
[2:11:04.680 --> 2:11:10.000]  pregnancy immaculate conception

[2:12:41.360 --> 2:12:47.160]  let's come out and attack Joe Rogan and said he'll beat him up just out of the
[2:12:47.160 --> 2:12:51.600]  blue I'll beat you up obviously because Joe's 10 times 20 times 30 times bigger
[2:12:51.600 --> 2:12:57.920]  than sink conservatively the force fed George Soros funded Google force fed
[2:12:57.920 --> 2:13:04.280]  minion that's next segment where a sink says he'll beat up Joe Rogan he's gonna
[2:13:04.280 --> 2:13:09.040]  beat him up I've actually seen Joe beat people up he was not as friendly as he
[2:13:09.040 --> 2:13:13.680]  is now at 50 something years old back when I knew him when he was in his 20s
[2:13:13.680 --> 2:13:18.240]  and late 20s and I was in my early 20s so I've actually seen big guys mess with
[2:13:18.240 --> 2:13:22.280]  Joe a few times and it didn't go too well he just chokes him out just jumps on
[2:13:22.280 --> 2:13:26.560]  top of him like a monkey he's like a gorilla and you know he kicks harder than
[2:13:26.560 --> 2:13:31.000]  like some of the biggest guys in the UFC they've had contests so I'm just
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:35.840]  getting kicked by him's like getting kicked by a mule and so again it's it's
[2:13:35.840 --> 2:13:41.160]  so ridiculous it's a stunt and it just shows the left is all about hoaxes you
[2:13:41.160 --> 2:13:45.840]  know men can have babies it's a gift to the baby to kill it it's good for them
[2:13:45.840 --> 2:13:50.000]  to not have a future they were so worthless this I've remeft it's bad but
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:55.560]  now Pfizer's coming out with a pill that has the same ingredients in it
[2:13:55.920 --> 2:14:00.080]  they're just bombing us with propaganda but you know all over the world people
[2:14:00.080 --> 2:14:03.800]  are fighting back in southern Australia and New South Wales has the worst UN
[2:14:03.800 --> 2:14:08.160]  programs the carbon tax the medical IDs and the police chief in one big city
[2:14:08.160 --> 2:14:11.000]  finally said we're not enforcing this anymore the public's gonna basically
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:15.960]  kill us well now Australia's New South Wales state premier that's their
[2:14:15.960 --> 2:14:20.800]  governor resigns over corruption problem in COVID-19 battle premier of
[2:14:20.800 --> 2:14:24.360]  Australia's biggest state has been announcing new world order and endless
[2:14:24.360 --> 2:14:30.080]  lockdowns the premier of Australia's biggest state economy New South Wales
[2:14:30.080 --> 2:14:37.320]  Gladdy Birkin Jinkolin looks about a weird Santa Claus's wife name resigned on
[2:14:37.320 --> 2:14:41.520]  Friday after a corruption watchdog said it was investigating whether she was
[2:14:41.520 --> 2:14:50.440]  involved in a conduct that is constituted are involved a breach or
[2:14:50.440 --> 2:14:54.720]  consistent or involved a breach of public trust reading our word name I
[2:14:54.720 --> 2:15:00.920]  suddenly couldn't read constituted or involved a breach of public trust and it
[2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:07.960]  says Birkin Jinkolin's shock resignation comes as the state which has an
[2:15:07.960 --> 2:15:12.280]  economy larger than Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia battles the biggest COVID-19
[2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:15.440]  outbreak you mean the total lockdown like 20 people have died in the last year
[2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:19.080]  and it's total hysteria and fake testing and lockups and permanent FEMA camps
[2:15:19.080 --> 2:15:24.920]  being built Birkin Jinkolin said that the issues being investigated were
[2:15:24.920 --> 2:15:29.520]  historical matters but she felt compelled to resign because of the long
[2:15:29.520 --> 2:15:33.480]  time frames like to be involved in investigation and who knows what it is
[2:15:33.480 --> 2:15:37.920]  all I know is most these people have been put in power because they're blackmailed
[2:15:37.920 --> 2:15:41.480]  with stuff and it's usually not bad enough to be drug dealing or money
[2:15:41.480 --> 2:15:46.120]  laundering or even murder usually they have been involved with or have covered
[2:15:46.120 --> 2:15:50.520]  up what the German government officially ran giant pedophile rings with rape
[2:15:50.520 --> 2:15:54.960]  children remember that's mainstream news now 30,000 in one city alone given to be
[2:15:54.960 --> 2:15:58.080]  raped if you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own

[2:16:12.440 --> 2:16:17.000]  you need it most and unlike gas generators solar generators run quietly
[2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:21.920]  emit no dangerous fumes and produce an endless supply of free electricity from
[2:16:21.920 --> 2:16:26.360]  the Sun whether it's wildfires dangerous whether power grid issues or just

[2:19:06.680 --> 2:19:11.400]  clout swab and the UN and all the other globalist leaders own words they admit
[2:19:11.400 --> 2:19:16.720]  that once they've got you with that system then they're gonna carbon tax you
[2:19:16.720 --> 2:19:20.800]  everywhere you go and track what you do and publicly they're saying they're
[2:19:20.800 --> 2:19:25.600]  gonna decide when you can travel and when you can't travel and Mastercard and
[2:19:25.600 --> 2:19:28.840]  then all the other big companies are currently announcing they're gonna
[2:19:28.840 --> 2:19:34.040]  track what you do and where you go and tax you with a carbon tax for it this is
[2:19:34.040 --> 2:19:38.440]  the holy grail of tyranny ladies and gentlemen this is the takeover in
[2:19:38.440 --> 2:19:42.120]  humanity better wake up and say no finally folks are starting to wake up
[2:19:42.120 --> 2:19:46.040]  Joe Rogan Tucker Carlson others are leave the charts along with info wars but
[2:19:46.040 --> 2:19:50.480]  it's not enough every individual has to not comply we have to talk about bringing
[2:19:50.480 --> 2:19:54.520]  the globalist injustice you see they need the fear of God put in them legally
[2:19:54.520 --> 2:20:14.040]  and lawfully you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:20:24.520 --> 2:20:39.040]  that's right globalist love is like a guillotine it's like a ventilator when
[2:20:39.040 --> 2:20:45.120]  you got COVID it's gonna kill you but don't worry Pfizer's coming out with
[2:20:45.120 --> 2:20:48.480]  this new pill that cures COVID and it's got the same ingredients I've remept it
[2:20:48.480 --> 2:20:52.440]  in it they just slightly changed both molecules got the articles right here
[2:20:52.440 --> 2:20:54.920]  wow I remember saying a few weeks ago when they had a new bill coming out they
[2:20:54.920 --> 2:21:03.480]  wouldn't say what it was I go I bet it's ivermectin you had you taking money
[2:21:03.480 --> 2:21:06.840]  like these TV people and these talk show hosts even low-level ones that have like
[2:21:06.840 --> 2:21:09.800]  a maybe 10,000 subscribers you pay thousands of dollars to come out and
[2:21:09.800 --> 2:21:13.920]  say I took the shot I love it it's safe it's great I'll bet my bottom dollar I
[2:21:13.920 --> 2:21:18.560]  don't know this but that the young turds Howard Stern all of them took money but
[2:21:18.560 --> 2:21:23.480]  what I do know is sink is full of crap I've seen him I mean if I was an out-of-
[2:21:23.480 --> 2:21:27.920]  shape fat ass he's way worse than I am and again they said hey later you want
[2:21:27.920 --> 2:21:33.840]  to come on our show I've been on the show before I see him at the RNC 2016 I go
[2:21:33.840 --> 2:21:36.800]  to a bunch of other interviews with hundreds of shows going was a smorgasbord
[2:21:36.800 --> 2:21:42.720]  and I come back by and they go to break and I go hey sink how you doing then as
[2:21:42.720 --> 2:21:47.200]  he sees Roger Stone he goes oh he's broken in our studio it's an open
[2:21:47.200 --> 2:21:52.520]  convention center Roger goes screw you I'm not going on your show and he blows
[2:21:52.520 --> 2:21:56.680]  up at him sink did so the reason I'm going up to sink is he's put out a tweet
[2:21:56.680 --> 2:22:01.720]  just saying that he will beat up Joe Rogan that he knows how to defeat him he
[2:22:01.720 --> 2:22:07.040]  says he says if Joe Rogan tries to assault me whatever that's incredibly
[2:22:07.040 --> 2:22:12.760]  dumb but also wouldn't work I'm much larger than Joe yeah fatter I've fought
[2:22:12.760 --> 2:22:18.240]  my whole life not against championship martial arts people I'd end him but
[2:22:18.240 --> 2:22:23.480]  grown-ups don't do that he says that to a person that said I bet you a thousand
[2:22:23.480 --> 2:22:27.560]  dollars you won't talk crap the Joe's face he's calling Joe a liar and a punk
[2:22:27.560 --> 2:22:31.560]  and a bad guy he's talking about Iver Mectin and stuff so again I've known Joe
[2:22:31.560 --> 2:22:39.440]  since I was 24 years old 24 25 and I mean back then I mean I was like I've
[2:22:39.440 --> 2:22:42.920]  seen Joe beat people up several times big guys hey punk you think you're tough
[2:22:42.920 --> 2:22:45.920]  and he just like jumps on them and chokes them out or grabs and throws them
[2:22:45.920 --> 2:22:49.360]  the ground I mean like from like six foot four or five guys and we can show
[2:22:49.360 --> 2:22:52.480]  the footage of Joe doing kicks that even the top people can't do now his
[2:22:52.480 --> 2:22:56.200]  backs out his bones yeah people said oh can you beat up Logan Paul he said no
[2:22:56.200 --> 2:22:59.760]  Logan Paul kick my ass he's young he's big he's heavyweight but I don't know
[2:22:59.760 --> 2:23:03.080]  Joe would probably with Jiu Jitsu beat him I mean Joe's a legitimate badass and
[2:23:03.080 --> 2:23:07.120]  I'm not kissing his ass I mean I know Joe I've seen him do it I mean I'm a good
[2:23:07.120 --> 2:23:10.360]  brawler I could fight if I need to he would technique would just choke me out
[2:23:10.360 --> 2:23:17.120]  quickly I mean he's like a gorilla okay and to have Sink running around saying
[2:23:17.120 --> 2:23:24.360]  all this is insane now let's go ahead here and go to this clip this is Sink
[2:23:24.360 --> 2:23:28.240]  talking about how because the Democrats have now been fact-checking and they're
[2:23:28.240 --> 2:23:32.360]  going around defending the bestiality there's an article with leftist fact
[2:23:32.360 --> 2:23:36.480]  checkers that defending the muzzles being brought in from the Middle East that
[2:23:36.480 --> 2:23:40.200]  are into bestiality and have put child porn and bestiality on their phones and
[2:23:40.200 --> 2:23:43.400]  they're fact-checking that it's not a cow it's a horse they're having sex with so
[2:23:43.400 --> 2:23:46.880]  it's okay and and Sink has now been out you know I guess defending those
[2:23:46.880 --> 2:23:51.240]  migrants so let's remember that if he was a dictator he thinks about legalizing
[2:23:51.240 --> 2:23:56.560]  bestiality and pleasuring animals here it is I have decided what that boy boy
[2:23:56.560 --> 2:24:01.720]  chick was doing she was doing a jaywalking of bestiality like yeah it
[2:24:01.720 --> 2:24:05.000]  might technically be a crime but it's good let's not waste the course time on
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:08.480]  the jaywalk okay yeah I'm saying yeah yeah fair enough but here comes the
[2:24:08.480 --> 2:24:13.800]  controversial part the part I shouldn't say I believe that I am going I if I
[2:24:13.800 --> 2:24:20.480]  were the ruler the benevolent dictator of the world I would legalize bestiality
[2:24:20.480 --> 2:24:27.920]  where you are giving you are you are pleasuring the animal you see what I'm
[2:24:27.920 --> 2:24:34.240]  saying okay okay what went out why why did that happen yeah why is that wrong
[2:24:34.240 --> 2:24:39.720]  you know I'll tell you why I'll tell you why because like so there's like was
[2:24:39.720 --> 2:24:42.920]  the case that we covered where there was like a guy or a girl or something that
[2:24:42.920 --> 2:24:47.680]  was pleasuring a horse and the horse came to a conclusion right so who got
[2:24:47.680 --> 2:24:51.040]  harmed you know that people say that's enough so something he says about
[2:24:51.040 --> 2:24:55.920]  pedophiles or the nambler says they say not him nambler says it's okay to do it
[2:24:55.920 --> 2:25:01.360]  you know just so long as the child enjoys it as long as it's love and we'll
[2:25:01.360 --> 2:25:03.760]  find some good stuff at Joe doing famous kicks her in a minute that's just a
[2:25:03.760 --> 2:25:07.760]  round of stuff the crew found let's go ahead and go to sneak coming after me
[2:25:07.760 --> 2:25:11.400]  and and flipping out at the RNC
[2:25:22.560 --> 2:25:26.840]  all right Roger yeah run away Roger don't go he wants to debate you right now I'm
[2:25:26.840 --> 2:25:30.200]  not gonna debate this guy you're a hatchet man I don't know what anyone in
[2:25:30.200 --> 2:25:34.760]  the media takes you seriously all you do is lie you're known as the biggest liar
[2:25:34.760 --> 2:25:37.880]  in media you're the biggest liar in the world you're the biggest liar in the
[2:25:37.880 --> 2:26:01.480]  lie loser
[2:26:37.880 --> 2:26:44.880]  Jimmy Dore loves me.
[2:26:44.880 --> 2:27:02.440]  Okay, so I'm going to be a radio listener and share a bunch of yelling.
[2:27:02.440 --> 2:27:03.440]  We'll keep it on the video.
[2:27:03.440 --> 2:27:11.840]  It's in the middle of a sports stadium, convention center, and there's just radio and TV booths
[2:27:11.840 --> 2:27:19.320]  every 20 feet, so he's in the hallway, and he sees Roger, and then he lies, he goes back
[2:27:19.320 --> 2:27:24.520]  on air and says, Roger attacked our stage, Roger came on his show, we tried to crash
[2:27:24.520 --> 2:27:25.520]  it.
[2:27:25.520 --> 2:27:28.960]  Roger was like walking 30 feet away down the hall, and he saw him too, because Roger
[2:27:28.960 --> 2:27:29.960]  was with us.
[2:27:29.960 --> 2:27:33.920]  I just got up and said, hey, I'm here, you want to talk?
[2:27:33.920 --> 2:27:38.240]  And I gave him a Bill Clinton rape shirt when he wasn't even on air yet, and he got really,
[2:27:38.240 --> 2:27:39.720]  really mad about that.
[2:27:39.720 --> 2:27:44.600]  So now he wants to kick Joe Rogan's ass, because he knows he'll never have to follow through
[2:27:44.600 --> 2:27:45.600]  with it.
[2:27:45.600 --> 2:27:49.600]  He just can now be in the news, because he's so desperate, because when it came out that
[2:27:49.600 --> 2:27:55.760]  they were funded by Soros in front of the Democratic Party and our worshipers of Hillary
[2:27:55.760 --> 2:28:00.520]  and through Bernie under the bus and all that other stuff, they are a joke, and I'm sad
[2:28:00.520 --> 2:28:05.160]  that the young turds turned into that, but I mean, when you're a turd, you're a turd,
[2:28:05.160 --> 2:28:12.840]  and they are named after the group that exterminated a million and a half Christians in Armenia,
[2:28:12.840 --> 2:28:17.560]  and I guess it's Stockholm syndrome with the chick on there, because she claims that she
[2:28:17.560 --> 2:28:22.120]  is a Christian from that area of the world, so when you name yourself after basically
[2:28:22.120 --> 2:28:26.680]  the Turkish Hitler youth, that is not a good thing.
[2:28:26.680 --> 2:28:29.200]  That is not a good thing.
[2:28:29.200 --> 2:28:30.200]  So there you go.
[2:28:30.200 --> 2:28:32.200]  We have a little bit of fun with that.
[2:28:32.200 --> 2:28:40.640]  Last from the past there, ladies and gentlemen, with Sink Unger, Uggur, acting like a fool,
[2:28:40.640 --> 2:28:44.200]  and then currently acting like a fool, saying that he's going to beat up Joe Rogan because
[2:28:44.200 --> 2:28:45.640]  he's bigger than Joe.
[2:28:45.640 --> 2:28:51.600]  Actually, he's about the height of Joe, and again, he looks like he has trouble walking.
[2:28:51.600 --> 2:28:55.320]  So, wow, pretty amazing, these people are all talk.
[2:28:55.320 --> 2:28:59.120]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[2:28:59.120 --> 2:29:03.800]  electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[2:29:03.800 --> 2:29:04.800]  Here's why.
[2:29:04.800 --> 2:29:08.800]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[2:29:08.800 --> 2:29:14.080]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most, and unlike
[2:29:14.080 --> 2:29:20.080]  gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless
[2:29:20.080 --> 2:29:22.920]  supply of free electricity from the sun.
[2:29:22.920 --> 2:29:26.840]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the
[2:29:26.840 --> 2:29:31.600]  grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:29:31.600 --> 2:29:36.880]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses
[2:29:36.880 --> 2:29:37.880]  too.

[2:30:56.240 --> 2:31:03.000]  In late August, Info War saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[2:31:03.000 --> 2:31:08.480]  that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause
[2:31:08.480 --> 2:31:12.480]  an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[2:31:12.480 --> 2:31:15.800]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to
[2:31:15.800 --> 2:31:16.800]  have.
[2:31:16.800 --> 2:31:21.160]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water filtration,
[2:31:21.160 --> 2:31:23.480]  self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[2:31:23.480 --> 2:31:26.920]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in.

[2:31:40.320 --> 2:31:41.640]  already taking place.
[2:31:41.640 --> 2:31:47.920]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the Info War at infowarstore.com.
[2:31:47.920 --> 2:31:51.800]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their

[2:33:31.760 --> 2:33:32.760]  left.
[2:33:32.760 --> 2:33:41.080]  We have Dr. Richard Bartlett on who said that he is a hero, the first person to develop
[2:33:41.080 --> 2:33:47.080]  a protocol, pretty much the start of it, with thousands of patients to prove it in New York
[2:33:47.080 --> 2:33:53.880]  state for early at home treatment with close to 100% success.
[2:33:53.880 --> 2:33:58.760]  And he joins us now to cover the waterfront, but I really wanted to get him on today so
[2:33:58.760 --> 2:34:02.880]  that he could speak to what I've heard him on other shows saying, because I don't just
[2:34:02.880 --> 2:34:03.880]  have him here.
[2:34:03.880 --> 2:34:04.880]  I watch him.
[2:34:04.880 --> 2:34:05.880]  I listen to what he has to say as a trailblazer.
[2:34:05.880 --> 2:34:07.360]  That's who I tune into.
[2:34:07.360 --> 2:34:10.800]  People that are right, not people that are wrong, like CNN on purpose.
[2:34:10.800 --> 2:34:12.920]  And he's talking about we need to have tribunals.
[2:34:12.920 --> 2:34:16.040]  And that's not just some foggy thing off that we wish we were going to have.
[2:34:16.040 --> 2:34:19.360]  We better have it, or they're going to keep with their great reset, taking over with it.
[2:34:19.360 --> 2:34:21.120]  And he's got the wide spectrum knowledge.
[2:34:21.120 --> 2:34:23.400]  You know, a Senator ran Paul's a doctor.
[2:34:23.400 --> 2:34:24.400]  He's a nice guy.
[2:34:24.400 --> 2:34:27.880]  He loves to defend the vaccine, but say natural immunity is better, which is true.
[2:34:27.880 --> 2:34:29.120]  But no, the studies are out.
[2:34:29.120 --> 2:34:30.120]  It's deadly.
[2:34:30.120 --> 2:34:31.120]  It's causing blood clots.
[2:34:31.120 --> 2:34:34.600]  Ron Johnson, you know, is up there going, look, since we did the vaccines, there's more
[2:34:34.600 --> 2:34:38.560]  death and problems, but I'm still with the vaccine.
[2:34:38.560 --> 2:34:43.240]  It isn't a vaccine, according to the developer of mRNA technology, because it doesn't work
[2:34:43.240 --> 2:34:44.240]  for that.
[2:34:44.240 --> 2:34:45.240]  It's poisonous.
[2:34:45.240 --> 2:34:47.240]  And so does the former chief scientist at Pfizer.
[2:34:47.240 --> 2:34:50.200]  And so does the Nobel Prize winner for discovering HIV.
[2:34:50.200 --> 2:34:53.000]  It's a laundry list of who's who being censored.
[2:34:53.000 --> 2:34:56.440]  So ZStackLife.com's website.
[2:34:56.440 --> 2:35:00.120]  I want to show people this right now because he's totally vindicated, and we need to celebrate
[2:35:00.120 --> 2:35:04.440]  people that are trailblazers and right because those are the people that lead us out of the
[2:35:04.440 --> 2:35:05.440]  slavery.
[2:35:05.440 --> 2:35:07.800]  Gee, what could it be?
[2:35:07.800 --> 2:35:15.040]  UK newspaper reports mystery rise in heart attacks from blocked arteries, 25%, similar
[2:35:15.040 --> 2:35:20.200]  numbers in the U.S. and Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe.
[2:35:20.200 --> 2:35:23.880]  Oh, he's been vindicated again.
[2:35:23.880 --> 2:35:27.960]  Pfizer launches final study on COVID drug that's suspiciously similar to horse pace.
[2:35:27.960 --> 2:35:32.000]  It turns out it has the same active compounds in it.
[2:35:32.000 --> 2:35:36.920]  Oh, wow.
[2:35:36.920 --> 2:35:38.520]  The Congress and its staff are exempt.
[2:35:38.520 --> 2:35:39.680]  The judicial branch is exempt.
[2:35:39.680 --> 2:35:40.760]  The White House is exempt.
[2:35:40.760 --> 2:35:41.760]  The CDC is exempt.
[2:35:41.760 --> 2:35:45.160]  I guess just like Nazis were exempt from going to death camps.
[2:35:45.160 --> 2:35:46.400]  I don't say that lightly.
[2:35:46.400 --> 2:35:52.840]  FDA employees exempt, USPS employees exempt, NIAID employees exempt, Pfizer employees exempt,
[2:35:52.840 --> 2:35:54.080]  Moderna employees exempt.
[2:35:54.080 --> 2:35:58.960]  Joe Rogan, I talked to you last night, all over the news has the left saying he made
[2:35:58.960 --> 2:36:02.880]  light of the Holocaust and that Joe Rogan should be taken out of the air because he
[2:36:02.880 --> 2:36:07.960]  said making us show an ID to buy and sell, making us take shots is the same road that
[2:36:07.960 --> 2:36:08.960]  led to Nazi Germany.
[2:36:08.960 --> 2:36:10.440]  He didn't say it was Nazi Germany.
[2:36:10.440 --> 2:36:12.800]  It's just the same road leading there.
[2:36:12.800 --> 2:36:17.480]  So I also thought that we would add Dr. Zelenko because he's a trailblazer and he also happens
[2:36:17.480 --> 2:36:18.480]  to be Jewish.
[2:36:18.480 --> 2:36:22.800]  He's talked about how he's had ancestors and people that have faced this type of thing
[2:36:22.800 --> 2:36:23.800]  before.
[2:36:23.800 --> 2:36:27.520]  And so I thought maybe upfront because he's been vindicated, we talk about my good friend
[2:36:27.520 --> 2:36:32.000]  Joe Rogan who's under real sustained attack because he put out a minute and a half video
[2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:34.520]  will air at the bottom of the hour, stayed in the obvious.
[2:36:34.520 --> 2:36:37.280]  So Dr. Zelenko, have you seen the video?
[2:36:37.280 --> 2:36:40.400]  And first off, congratulations on being a trailblazer of trailblazers.
[2:36:40.400 --> 2:36:42.480]  And what do you think of what Joe Rogan said?
[2:36:42.480 --> 2:36:44.960]  Joe Rogan is a hero.
[2:36:44.960 --> 2:36:46.600]  I respect him.
[2:36:46.600 --> 2:36:54.800]  I think he has the platform and the courage to transmit the message of hope and lead us,
[2:36:54.800 --> 2:37:02.480]  be part of the solution to lead us out of this man-made, manufactured, slippery slope
[2:37:02.480 --> 2:37:04.960]  down to slavery.
[2:37:04.960 --> 2:37:09.800]  And I'd like to actually commemorate some historical event that happened this week,
[2:37:09.800 --> 2:37:13.600]  which is very relevant to me and relevant to us.
[2:37:13.600 --> 2:37:19.640]  This is the anniversary of the massacre at Babiyar.
[2:37:19.640 --> 2:37:27.240]  Babiyar is a wood outside of a ravine actually, outside of Kiev in the Ukraine, where around
[2:37:27.240 --> 2:37:33.560]  100,000 innocent people were murdered, initially shot into the ravine.
[2:37:33.560 --> 2:37:39.080]  And then when they ran out of bullets, they just pushed them in bulldozer them in alive
[2:37:39.080 --> 2:37:43.440]  and buried them alive, 40 of which were my relatives.
[2:37:43.440 --> 2:37:56.760]  So when I talk about genocide, and when I talk about Nazism and fascism, and racism,
[2:37:56.760 --> 2:38:07.520]  and malfeasance, and such evil, it's not a theoretical concept for me, but very visceral
[2:38:07.520 --> 2:38:08.520]  and real to me.
[2:38:08.520 --> 2:38:17.440]  And I grew up in stories about how my grandparents were soldiers, how my grandmothers were evacuated,
[2:38:17.440 --> 2:38:21.800]  how they witnessed people they loved, murdered, slaughtered, and so on.
[2:38:21.800 --> 2:38:28.440]  So when I see what's going on now, I have the proper historical context, I think, to
[2:38:28.440 --> 2:38:34.680]  process and be able to tell you that there is a genocide going on right now.
[2:38:34.680 --> 2:38:37.400]  And I don't use that word gently.
[2:38:37.400 --> 2:38:42.560]  My family has been a victim of genocide, so I really am screaming that this is the genocide
[2:38:42.560 --> 2:38:49.920]  of the innocent, of the vulnerable, and of the people that we're obligated to protect.
[2:38:49.920 --> 2:38:54.880]  The only difference between this genocide and the genocide 80 years ago is that we're
[2:38:54.880 --> 2:38:59.760]  all Jewish, in a sense, from that perspective, because they're coming after all of us.
[2:38:59.760 --> 2:39:06.120]  The Nazi Holocaust was just a dry run for the eugenics program that we're witnessing
[2:39:06.120 --> 2:39:07.120]  now.
[2:39:07.120 --> 2:39:12.360]  And this so-called vaccine, which is really just nothing more than a poison depth shot,
[2:39:12.360 --> 2:39:19.320]  which is an extension of a weapon of eugenics, has the following known effects.
[2:39:19.320 --> 2:39:26.320]  No one even has the audacity to deny it, is that blood clots are killing probably already
[2:39:26.320 --> 2:39:32.920]  over 300,000 Americans, and that's an underestimate, I think, in causing heart attacks and strokes.
[2:39:32.920 --> 2:39:37.160]  And then you have myocarditis, which is inflammation of the hearts, which has a 50 percent mortality
[2:39:37.160 --> 2:39:40.480]  rate within five years, and miscarriage rates.
[2:39:40.480 --> 2:39:43.960]  In the first trimester, I've gone up from 10 percent to 82 percent.
[2:39:43.960 --> 2:39:49.880]  The incidence of cancer and autoimmune diseases have skyrocketed.
[2:39:49.880 --> 2:39:53.840]  There is evidence of ovarian dysfunction and question about future infertility.
[2:39:53.840 --> 2:39:55.400]  And that's the light stuff.
[2:39:55.400 --> 2:40:02.200]  The real concern that you mentioned is this genocidal antibody-dependent enhancement concern
[2:40:02.200 --> 2:40:06.560]  that all the world experts are yelling, saying, stop, stop using these vaccines.
[2:40:06.560 --> 2:40:10.040]  They may lead to the genocide of billions of people dead.
[2:40:10.040 --> 2:40:15.720]  And this is what's being advocated and pushed in a tyrannical fashion on innocent human
[2:40:15.720 --> 2:40:19.480]  beings where there is zero medical necessity.
[2:40:19.480 --> 2:40:24.680]  Because the young don't need it, near 100 percent of the kids, healthy kids get better.
[2:40:24.680 --> 2:40:28.120]  The healthy adults get better with treatment, near 100 percent.
[2:40:28.120 --> 2:40:33.240]  People that have had COVID have better immunity and are more immune than if they were vaccinated.
[2:40:33.240 --> 2:40:37.400]  And the high-risk population who could treat them properly reduced the risk of death to
[2:40:37.400 --> 2:40:38.400]  less than 1 percent.
[2:40:38.400 --> 2:40:47.560]  So this is an artificially made global pandemic of fear and isolation used to manipulate gullible
[2:40:47.560 --> 2:40:52.880]  people into taking a poison death shot and to reduce the world population.
[2:40:52.880 --> 2:40:53.880]  And this is not a theory.
[2:40:53.880 --> 2:40:59.680]  It's definitely a conspiracy to commit mass murder and genocide, but it's not a theory.
[2:40:59.680 --> 2:41:02.600]  And that's been proven multiple times.
[2:41:02.600 --> 2:41:10.160]  There are patent numbers associated with transformations of this virus from a bat coronavirus to a human
[2:41:10.160 --> 2:41:14.960]  virus done by Ralph Barrick, as you know, and this patent associated with that.
[2:41:14.960 --> 2:41:20.520]  And then Wuhan, they weaponized it and made it absolutely destructive, lethal to lungs,
[2:41:20.520 --> 2:41:22.240]  human lungs and blood clots.
[2:41:22.240 --> 2:41:27.840]  And then there's a patent that came out last month that shows that there's tracking technology,
[2:41:27.840 --> 2:41:33.520]  both internal sensors, where it measures the internal physiological data and then is able
[2:41:33.520 --> 2:41:37.920]  to transmit that data together with your location to a central server.
[2:41:37.920 --> 2:41:40.200]  And that technology already exists.
[2:41:40.200 --> 2:41:41.600]  And I have the patent number, by the way.
[2:41:41.600 --> 2:41:45.320]  I think I said it last time, but I think it's good to mention it.
[2:41:45.320 --> 2:41:46.320]  Absolutely.
[2:41:46.320 --> 2:41:50.800]  So, by the way, don't believe a word I'm saying.
[2:41:50.800 --> 2:41:51.800]  Do your due diligence.
[2:41:51.800 --> 2:41:56.080]  Don't make the same mistake with me that you do with the government by believing everything
[2:41:56.080 --> 2:41:57.960]  blindly.
[2:41:57.960 --> 2:41:58.960]  Question everything.
[2:41:58.960 --> 2:42:04.440]  Take what I'm saying, don't believe me, vet what I'm saying, and see if I'm telling you
[2:42:04.440 --> 2:42:05.440]  the truth.
[2:42:05.440 --> 2:42:14.120]  Patent number, United States Patent Number 11107588, again, 11107588 describes the tracking
[2:42:14.120 --> 2:42:20.440]  technology and transmitting technology that already exists in the vaccine that you're
[2:42:20.440 --> 2:42:21.880]  going to get into.
[2:42:21.880 --> 2:42:27.480]  So, and what's interesting is, I find this remarkable, the lipid nanoparticle delivery
[2:42:27.480 --> 2:42:38.040]  system basically ensures that toxic mRNA spike protein producing code is transferred into
[2:42:38.040 --> 2:42:39.520]  your nervous system.
[2:42:39.520 --> 2:42:41.800]  If you look in the, there was a slide.
[2:42:41.800 --> 2:42:43.040]  Doc, this is key.
[2:42:43.040 --> 2:42:45.800]  Let's come back and get right into this with Dr. Zalinko.
[2:42:45.800 --> 2:42:51.080]  He's got his website, zstacklife.com, Dr. Vladimir Zevsalinko.
[2:42:51.080 --> 2:42:55.400]  This is on target stuff and millions of folks would have died with COVID if he had my nose
[2:42:55.400 --> 2:42:56.400]  covered.
[2:42:56.400 --> 2:42:59.520]  Now, you've heard me talk about the Biopros and how they're creating amazing products.
[2:42:59.520 --> 2:43:05.120]  They've done it again and have just released an entire suite of bioremediation products
[2:43:05.120 --> 2:43:08.480]  bringing industrial level technology to the everyday consumer.
[2:43:08.480 --> 2:43:12.600]  They're literally changing the industry with a revolutionary patented delivery system.
[2:43:12.600 --> 2:43:18.280]  The Biopros are excited to release Biodrain Pro, a product specifically designed to establish
[2:43:18.280 --> 2:43:22.000]  healthy drains, pipes and overall plumbing systems.
[2:43:22.000 --> 2:43:27.920]  Biodrain Pro digests grease, fats, oil, sludge, paper and organic matter with ease.
[2:43:27.920 --> 2:43:34.200]  It contains no chemicals, no GMOs and is safe for black, gray holding tanks, sewer hoses
[2:43:34.200 --> 2:43:35.200]  and plumbing.
[2:43:35.200 --> 2:43:37.240]  It is also human and animal safe.
[2:43:37.240 --> 2:43:41.480]  Get up to 20 treatments with the scoop for easy applications.
[2:43:41.480 --> 2:43:46.880]  Say goodbye to drain problems, gas buildup and odor, guaranteed.
[2:43:46.880 --> 2:43:48.200]  Just pour and add water.
[2:43:48.200 --> 2:43:49.200]  It's that simple.
[2:43:49.200 --> 2:43:54.440]  Visit theBiopros.com and see for yourself.
[2:43:54.440 --> 2:43:59.120]  People ask me, Alex, why did you come out with a new natural organic sleep aid when
[2:43:59.120 --> 2:44:03.040]  you already have knockout that works so well with eight natural ingredients?
[2:44:03.040 --> 2:44:07.920]  Well, because when you've taken a certain organic blend for a decade, like I've taken
[2:44:07.920 --> 2:44:11.080]  this product I came up with, it doesn't work as well anymore.
[2:44:11.080 --> 2:44:12.080]  That's the way herbs work.
[2:44:12.080 --> 2:44:15.720]  Do you go off for a while, come back on it, it works again.
[2:44:15.720 --> 2:44:16.720]  So what did I do?
[2:44:16.720 --> 2:44:19.840]  I went to the developers and I said, make a totally different formula with a lot of other
[2:44:19.840 --> 2:44:23.560]  known natural healthy compounds that make you sleep deep and restful because that's what
[2:44:23.560 --> 2:44:27.920]  helps your immune system and I want it to be at least twice as strong as knockout.
[2:44:27.920 --> 2:44:30.160]  Okay, be careful when you take it.
[2:44:30.160 --> 2:44:31.480]  It's incredibly strong.
[2:44:31.480 --> 2:44:32.480]  It's named down and out.
[2:44:32.480 --> 2:44:36.400]  I don't have time to get into all the ingredients in it, but it is extremely strong and we are
[2:44:36.400 --> 2:44:37.880]  extremely proud of it.
[2:44:37.880 --> 2:44:44.400]  It is exclusively available at infowarstore.com, 50% off right now, sold out for more than
[2:44:44.400 --> 2:44:45.400]  four months.
[2:44:45.400 --> 2:44:49.840]  Now back at stock, get your down and out and your knockout at infowarstore.com today.
[2:44:49.840 --> 2:44:55.240]  Now thank you for your support because it keeps us on the air.
[2:44:55.240 --> 2:45:00.040]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[2:45:00.040 --> 2:45:02.080]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[2:45:02.080 --> 2:45:07.800]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[2:45:07.800 --> 2:45:08.800]  But we failed.
[2:45:08.800 --> 2:45:10.160]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[2:45:10.160 --> 2:45:14.880]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full
[2:45:14.880 --> 2:45:18.360]  operational deindustrialization great reset.
[2:45:18.360 --> 2:45:22.640]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[2:45:22.640 --> 2:45:27.240]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[2:45:27.240 --> 2:45:30.600]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've
[2:45:30.600 --> 2:45:32.320]  also got to get personally prepared.
[2:45:32.320 --> 2:45:35.120]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[2:45:35.120 --> 2:45:40.160]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[2:45:40.160 --> 2:45:44.160]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready
[2:45:44.160 --> 2:45:49.480]  to ship right now, lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long
[2:45:49.480 --> 2:45:52.960]  lines and waits because believe me, serious times are coming.
[2:45:52.960 --> 2:45:55.400]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[2:45:55.400 --> 2:46:02.080]  So the placebo that they have used that the FDA has allowed them to use has often been
[2:46:02.080 --> 2:46:04.000]  another vaccine.
[2:46:04.000 --> 2:46:08.320]  A vaccine with a known adverse reaction profile that's causing death and damage in its own
[2:46:08.320 --> 2:46:09.920]  right.
[2:46:09.920 --> 2:46:17.120]  That it's the aluminum as an adjuvant in the vaccine, a known neurotoxin, a known immunotoxin,
[2:46:17.120 --> 2:46:23.600]  a known poison in human beings that is in the supposedly inert placebo, totally inappropriate.
[2:46:23.600 --> 2:46:25.400]  This is not good science.
[2:46:25.400 --> 2:46:27.880]  It is not science at all.
[2:46:27.880 --> 2:46:33.080]  It is an effort to cover up the true adverse reaction rates to these vaccines so that they
[2:46:33.080 --> 2:46:40.000]  can get through the low barrier of constraints put there by the FDA and onto the market.
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:41.000]  That is the only concern.
[2:46:41.000 --> 2:46:46.320]  Dr. Wakefield is just one of many informed voices in the film, COVIDLand.

[2:46:59.720 --> 2:47:10.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:10.000 --> 2:47:15.320]  All right.
[2:47:15.320 --> 2:47:18.640]  We've got Dr. Vladimir Zebsilenko on the line with us.
[2:47:18.640 --> 2:47:21.840]  I've got a lot of questions, a lot of clips, a lot of things I want to go over with him.
[2:47:21.840 --> 2:47:27.320]  But he got caught off by the break getting into the real dangers and getting into the
[2:47:27.320 --> 2:47:31.640]  antibody enhancement situation and getting into what we're beginning to see.
[2:47:31.640 --> 2:47:32.640]  You got caught off by the break.
[2:47:32.640 --> 2:47:33.640]  Please continue, doctor.
[2:47:33.640 --> 2:47:38.560]  Can you remind me what was the last thing I said?
[2:47:38.560 --> 2:47:43.320]  You were going into more ways it's attacking people and more things it was doing and then
[2:47:43.320 --> 2:47:44.320]  we got hit.
[2:47:44.320 --> 2:47:45.320]  We hit the break.
[2:47:45.320 --> 2:47:46.320]  Yeah.
[2:47:46.320 --> 2:47:52.040]  I mean, this is artificially made by a weapon.
[2:47:52.040 --> 2:47:53.040]  Everyone realizes that now.
[2:47:53.040 --> 2:47:55.520]  There's no debate about that.
[2:47:55.520 --> 2:48:02.200]  It's been designed to create global fear and isolation and that global fear and isolation
[2:48:02.200 --> 2:48:10.360]  has been designed to psychologically wage warfare in the innocent human mind and psychologically
[2:48:10.360 --> 2:48:16.760]  decompensate people so that they become extremely gullible and willing to take a poison dev
[2:48:16.760 --> 2:48:17.760]  shot.
[2:48:17.760 --> 2:48:19.560]  And I really do mean it's a poison dev shot.
[2:48:19.560 --> 2:48:20.960]  It has no medical necessity.
[2:48:20.960 --> 2:48:28.120]  It doesn't work and has these really horrific eugenics type of effects that what it does
[2:48:28.120 --> 2:48:34.440]  is as several layers and waves of death, there's the acute death which happens within the three
[2:48:34.440 --> 2:48:38.400]  months that are blood clots and inflammation of hearts and miscarriages.
[2:48:38.400 --> 2:48:42.800]  Then there is that antibody dependent enhancement concern which is basically the person's immune
[2:48:42.800 --> 2:48:50.040]  system will kill the host organism when challenged with the virus that they're immunized against
[2:48:50.040 --> 2:48:55.960]  and that has been seen since the 60s in the RSV vaccine 70s, the dengue fever virus vaccine
[2:48:55.960 --> 2:49:00.560]  in the 80s and 90s, all the previous attempts of coronaviruses vaccines.
[2:49:00.560 --> 2:49:04.720]  And what's interesting is, wouldn't you think it's a good idea to exclude antibody dependent
[2:49:04.720 --> 2:49:10.200]  enhancement from the human race before you immunize 7 billion people?
[2:49:10.200 --> 2:49:11.200]  Absolutely.
[2:49:11.200 --> 2:49:14.200]  For those that don't know, there's been a lot's been talked about it, but what's the
[2:49:14.200 --> 2:49:17.960]  easiest way for people listening to explain to their friends and family about what this
[2:49:17.960 --> 2:49:20.200]  well-known syndrome is?
[2:49:20.200 --> 2:49:27.600]  Well, look, usually when someone is exposed to a virus, they develop an antibody response.
[2:49:27.600 --> 2:49:33.480]  Those antibodies then are protective and are designed to protect you from getting future
[2:49:33.480 --> 2:49:34.480]  infections.
[2:49:34.480 --> 2:49:38.240]  That's why people don't usually get measles twice or mumps or chickenpox twice.
[2:49:38.240 --> 2:49:44.640]  Now, an attempt to artificially produce that by giving vaccines in some cases is successful
[2:49:44.640 --> 2:49:50.760]  in other cases, it's not successful, and in the history of coronavirus vaccines, there
[2:49:50.760 --> 2:49:55.840]  have been multiple attempts to make vaccines that work.
[2:49:55.840 --> 2:50:02.000]  The problem was that once the animals were immunized, they developed an antibody response
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:09.040]  and everyone was happy, but then when we challenged those animals with the virus that they were
[2:50:09.040 --> 2:50:14.640]  immunized against, the animals died, now wait a minute, you're trying to protect and preserve
[2:50:14.640 --> 2:50:17.160]  the life of the animal, why was it dying?
[2:50:17.160 --> 2:50:21.840]  No one really understood it until they did more research and they saw that it was the
[2:50:21.840 --> 2:50:26.400]  actual immune reaction that your antibodies became bombs.
[2:50:26.400 --> 2:50:32.400]  When they came into contact with the virus that they were immunized against resulted
[2:50:32.400 --> 2:50:38.400]  in a lethal, homicidal, lethal reaction in the host organism.
[2:50:38.400 --> 2:50:43.080]  All the coronavirus vaccines have shown it, including these, so the question would be like
[2:50:43.080 --> 2:50:48.400]  this, you can argue maybe that human beings are different than animals and I would say
[2:50:48.400 --> 2:50:54.400]  maybe, but wouldn't it be a good idea to exclude that phenomenon from the human race before
[2:50:54.400 --> 2:51:02.600]  you deploy an experimental artificially made liquid into 7 billion people?
[2:51:02.600 --> 2:51:07.520]  And the answer is logically you would want to exclude that unless you already know the
[2:51:07.520 --> 2:51:13.440]  answer and unless your desire is not to help people but to reduce the world population.
[2:51:13.440 --> 2:51:17.200]  And Dr. I'm watching congressional hearings, I'm not a doctor like you, but I believe I've
[2:51:17.200 --> 2:51:25.320]  even seen supporters of the shots testify this dean of virology and things at Baylor
[2:51:25.320 --> 2:51:30.960]  here in Texas saying, oh, we've tried to make vaccines for the common flu before, but it
[2:51:30.960 --> 2:51:35.560]  creates the antibody enhancement syndrome sometimes and we had humans die in the trials.
[2:51:35.560 --> 2:51:39.080]  So haven't there been some cases where they tried this and it killed people because they've
[2:51:39.080 --> 2:51:40.080]  said that in Congress?
[2:51:40.080 --> 2:51:47.160]  Yeah, they did it with RSV vaccine, which killed more kids than RSV, we did it with the
[2:51:47.160 --> 2:51:53.760]  dengue virus, dengue fever virus vaccine killed more adults than the actual dengue virus.
[2:51:53.760 --> 2:51:57.200]  So this has been a known phenomenon, this is not unheard of.
[2:51:57.200 --> 2:52:03.760]  And that's why world experts are screaming the following, you're in the verge of killing
[2:52:03.760 --> 2:52:07.000]  off billions of people.
[2:52:07.000 --> 2:52:10.080]  It's a big gamble to make with innocent people, don't you think?
[2:52:10.080 --> 2:52:11.080]  And for what?
[2:52:11.080 --> 2:52:16.200]  For a virus that if every single human being on the planet got COVID-19 and was treated
[2:52:16.200 --> 2:52:18.680]  properly, the death rate would be less than five.
[2:52:18.680 --> 2:52:21.600]  But obviously as you've said, doctor, they didn't gamble with this.
[2:52:21.600 --> 2:52:25.480]  The same people running it say they want to depopulate us and you predicted over a year
[2:52:25.480 --> 2:52:29.480]  ago and others did that when people start dying, they're going to blame the vaccinated,
[2:52:29.480 --> 2:52:33.840]  because there's no of the unvaccinated, which is now the setup to be poisoning and killing
[2:52:33.840 --> 2:52:37.400]  one group and then tell them that the unvaccinated are the ones killing them.
[2:52:37.400 --> 2:52:38.400]  What a plan.
[2:52:38.400 --> 2:52:42.880]  It's pretty brilliantly evil.
[2:52:42.880 --> 2:52:47.760]  So the key here, this animal that you're showing on the screen right now is a sociopath of
[2:52:47.760 --> 2:52:57.200]  historic scale and is on record calling for the reduction of the world population.
[2:52:57.200 --> 2:53:02.360]  And I'm supposed to take a vaccine for my health from this sociopathic animal, Bill
[2:53:02.360 --> 2:53:07.760]  Gates, who the whole world is suffering because of his narcissism, because he couldn't get
[2:53:07.760 --> 2:53:08.760]  a girlfriend in high school.
[2:53:08.760 --> 2:53:12.440]  So now he has to take out his anger on every single human being on the planet.
[2:53:12.440 --> 2:53:15.480]  He gets off by stepping on your grade.
[2:53:15.480 --> 2:53:16.640]  This is a monster.
[2:53:16.640 --> 2:53:20.160]  And he's a symbol of a concept.
[2:53:20.160 --> 2:53:23.760]  These are Hitler and Stalin together on steroids.
[2:53:23.760 --> 2:53:27.640]  And yes, they should be brought on military trial.
[2:53:27.640 --> 2:53:33.360]  This is a war crime, we're in World War III, more than 200 countries are fighting the same
[2:53:33.360 --> 2:53:41.920]  invisible artificially made enemy, and they have propagated fear and have obstructed anything
[2:53:41.920 --> 2:53:47.640]  that has any legitimate treatment value, that has an ability to reduce the fear and restore
[2:53:47.640 --> 2:53:50.680]  humanity to some semblance of normality.
[2:53:50.680 --> 2:53:57.760]  These animals, these worse than animals, the sociopathic vermin, what they are trying to
[2:53:57.760 --> 2:54:04.600]  do is prolong the fear to get more and more people to take this poison death shot.
[2:54:04.600 --> 2:54:06.840]  Essentially, this is what's happening.
[2:54:06.840 --> 2:54:12.720]  You are not you, but we are walking into the gas chambers, rolling up our sleeve, asking
[2:54:12.720 --> 2:54:18.480]  to get a shot, getting a shot, smiling, paying them and saying thank you for killing us.
[2:54:18.480 --> 2:54:22.440]  Which is a smart weapon, when Hitler's Bob Arosa first went into Russia, they didn't
[2:54:22.440 --> 2:54:24.640]  like the communist, so they saw him as a savior.
[2:54:24.640 --> 2:54:28.640]  Then he started killing everybody, they fought back and the Russians beat Hitler.
[2:54:28.640 --> 2:54:31.840]  But it's the same thing here, if Hitler would have given people shots that killed him in
[2:54:31.840 --> 2:54:33.800]  two or three years, they would have never known.
[2:54:33.800 --> 2:54:37.560]  So they've just learned from history.
[2:54:37.560 --> 2:54:45.400]  It's history repeating itself, but on a scale that has never been seen before.
[2:54:45.400 --> 2:54:52.680]  We are on the verge of witnessing billions of people dying, corpses rotting in the streets,
[2:54:52.680 --> 2:54:59.120]  and people are too delusional to believe that that's not possible, but it's very possible
[2:54:59.120 --> 2:55:03.400]  and this has been the planned agenda of people for decades.
[2:55:03.400 --> 2:55:09.560]  This has not been recently concocted, because look, in order to pull this off, you need the
[2:55:09.560 --> 2:55:13.040]  coordination of major global industries.
[2:55:13.040 --> 2:55:18.680]  Four or five major industries have to work in unison to be able to pull off the worst
[2:55:18.680 --> 2:55:19.680]  crime in history.
[2:55:19.680 --> 2:55:20.680]  Which is what?
[2:55:20.680 --> 2:55:24.000]  When you need the control of the media, both social and mainstream, you need the control
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:25.000]  of academia.
[2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:28.960]  You need the control of politics, and you need the control of industry and the pharmaceutical
[2:55:28.960 --> 2:55:29.960]  industry.
[2:55:29.960 --> 2:55:38.120]  And there are only a few people on this planet that have our stakeholders in all those industries
[2:55:38.120 --> 2:55:42.560]  that are able to influence those industries in a coordinated fashion to pull off what
[2:55:42.560 --> 2:55:43.560]  they're doing.
[2:55:43.560 --> 2:55:47.080]  And those are the people, and I don't know exactly who they are, I have some ideas.
[2:55:47.080 --> 2:55:50.640]  Well Doc, you come to the right place, because you're an expert in medical stuff, and you've
[2:55:50.640 --> 2:55:53.960]  also figured this out for yourself, but I've read their writings, I know you have as well.
[2:55:53.960 --> 2:55:57.080]  It's Bill Gates, it's Klaus Schwab, and then it's some of the royal families and some of
[2:55:57.080 --> 2:56:01.520]  the big money, the big classic families that went underground, all the robber barons, the
[2:56:01.520 --> 2:56:03.440]  Rockefellers are right at the heart of it.
[2:56:03.440 --> 2:56:06.880]  They all write books, they're all on record saying they wanted this, they wrote Operation
[2:56:06.880 --> 2:56:11.280]  Lockstep, Planning and All Out 11 years ago, and it's them, sir.
[2:56:11.280 --> 2:56:17.480]  Yes, that I know, but I would even argue that the real villains are too smart to be in the
[2:56:17.480 --> 2:56:23.720]  media, that there's going to be a layer of evil that is so smart when you get to the
[2:56:23.720 --> 2:56:27.920]  core of the onion, they may even transcend those people that you're saying, because they're
[2:56:27.920 --> 2:56:30.320]  too smart to put themselves out there.
[2:56:30.320 --> 2:56:33.440]  That's what all the top level folks that I know that have headed up US intelligence agencies,
[2:56:33.440 --> 2:56:37.640]  these others tell me, they just say the real rulers are completely insulated and work through
[2:56:37.640 --> 2:56:38.640]  Schwab and Gates.
[2:56:38.640 --> 2:56:43.280]  But we better know, Gates and Schwab are literally the field marshals, along with the head of
[2:56:43.280 --> 2:56:45.120]  Pfizer that are running the attack.
[2:56:45.120 --> 2:56:50.280]  Yes, I agree with that, including the, look, the primordial, we're dealing with the primordial
[2:56:50.280 --> 2:56:56.560]  snake, the primordial serpent, and it's now enclosed in body and has different heads.
[2:56:56.560 --> 2:57:01.880]  Obviously, the Chinese Communist Party is one head, Bill Gates is another head, World
[2:57:01.880 --> 2:57:07.320]  Economic Forum is another head, but it's the totality of the evil, they may even have
[2:57:07.320 --> 2:57:12.960]  different agendas, but one thing they share in common, which is the enslavement of innocent
[2:57:12.960 --> 2:57:20.560]  people, because ultimately they derive their some perverse sexual pleasure of controlling
[2:57:20.560 --> 2:57:22.080]  others and destroying others.
[2:57:22.080 --> 2:57:25.600]  They want our will turn to them, you're absolutely on target, I want to come back with you to
[2:57:25.600 --> 2:57:28.880]  get more into wherever you want to go, I got a bunch of questions, I got the Joe Rogan video,
[2:57:28.880 --> 2:57:32.600]  I want your take on it, because they're calling this bad and evil, because it's powerful.
[2:57:32.600 --> 2:57:35.880]  And last time I checked, it's got like 15 million views now.
[2:57:35.880 --> 2:57:39.640]  And so absolutely, we get Joe Rogan fully awake, they're in trouble, and it's, it's
[2:57:39.640 --> 2:57:40.640]  happened folks.
[2:57:40.640 --> 2:57:44.880]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[2:57:44.880 --> 2:57:49.560]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war
[2:57:49.560 --> 2:57:55.200]  between free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other
[2:57:55.200 --> 2:57:58.200]  who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[2:57:58.200 --> 2:58:03.000]  From the United States to Brazil, and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK,
[2:58:03.000 --> 2:58:06.680]  Americans were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government.
[2:58:06.680 --> 2:58:12.080]  That's why they launched their great recess and their program after collapsing us of build
[2:58:12.080 --> 2:58:13.880]  back better.
[2:58:13.880 --> 2:58:19.840]  This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy, and because
[2:58:19.840 --> 2:58:24.760]  they couldn't take our guns, because we wouldn't bow, because the left, which is the ideology
[2:58:24.760 --> 2:58:30.600]  of this world government system couldn't win, they released a biological weapon on us.
[2:58:30.600 --> 2:58:35.560]  And now we know, two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago, it's that simple,
[2:58:35.560 --> 2:58:39.920]  they can't maybe because of our free speech and our guns, so the global corporate combine
[2:58:39.920 --> 2:58:45.960]  released COVID-19, and you know the rest is history, expose this paradigm and we win.
[2:58:45.960 --> 2:58:51.960]  I got some good news, all the items in front of me are back in stock and are 40 to 50%
[2:58:51.960 --> 2:58:53.840]  off and in FullWarsHore.com.
[2:58:53.840 --> 2:58:58.280]  The bad news is, a lot of them are about to sell out, so this sale is only going from

[2:59:42.960 --> 3:00:08.960]  Again, all we lose is if you don't take action right now.
[3:00:12.960 --> 3:00:19.720]  All right, this is a short segment, long segment coming up, and we've got Dr. Zalinko here
[3:00:19.720 --> 3:00:22.920]  with us that, again, out of everybody out there, he gets it more than anybody else we've
[3:00:22.920 --> 3:00:26.840]  talked to, and he's a medical doctor on top of it, and he trailblazed things they try
[3:00:26.840 --> 3:00:31.320]  to suppress that conservatively around the world to have saved millions of people, including
[3:00:31.320 --> 3:00:32.320]  my dad.
[3:00:32.320 --> 3:00:36.640]  He didn't tell me he was sick with COVID when I got there, 82 oxygen, couldn't get up,
[3:00:36.640 --> 3:00:43.160]  looked like he was dead, blue, in the bed, looked like he was 90 years old instead of
[3:00:43.160 --> 3:00:48.120]  71, and once he got on the things that Dr. Zalinko and Dr. Bartlett talked about next
[3:00:48.120 --> 3:00:53.520]  day, again, he was 90% better, incredible, and I know, I mean, I thought he was dead
[3:00:53.520 --> 3:00:54.520]  when I got there.
[3:00:54.520 --> 3:00:56.400]  They had put him in the hospital, he'd have been dead.
[3:00:56.400 --> 3:01:01.320]  Sir, let's do this here, let's tell people in the next 45 minutes what you're going
[3:01:01.320 --> 3:01:02.320]  to break down.
[3:01:02.320 --> 3:01:04.760]  I'd go longer than that, I know you would too, I've got to go to a meeting right at
[3:01:04.760 --> 3:01:08.040]  three central, I know you've got to go to, but what is it you want to hit when we come
[3:01:08.040 --> 3:01:11.040]  back to the next time, because I'm going to try to give you the floor to continue, and
[3:01:11.040 --> 3:01:14.760]  I think where you were already going when we hit the break was identifying this, admitting
[3:01:14.760 --> 3:01:19.080]  it to ourselves, and really coming to grips with the fact that we are in World War III.
[3:01:19.080 --> 3:01:22.080]  I totally agree with the way you put it, that's it.
[3:01:22.080 --> 3:01:28.800]  Well, World War III is exactly that, and our response, we have to shift from peace
[3:01:28.800 --> 3:01:30.440]  footing to war footing.
[3:01:30.440 --> 3:01:35.200]  That includes the military tribunals, but more importantly, the way we approach life,
[3:01:35.200 --> 3:01:40.880]  the way we approach medicine, the way we approach time itself, we don't have time to spend two,
[3:01:40.880 --> 3:01:45.280]  three, four years doing research while millions of people die.
[3:01:45.280 --> 3:01:49.880]  We need to improvise on the ground like good marines, you know, and you assess the situation,
[3:01:49.880 --> 3:01:57.480]  you change on the fly, and you try, through trial and error, different strategies until
[3:01:57.480 --> 3:01:58.480]  you find one that works.
[3:01:58.480 --> 3:02:06.440]  That's exactly what I did, in March of 2020, I had thousands, hundreds, probably thousands
[3:02:06.440 --> 3:02:09.480]  of sick patients with no treatment, but what are you supposed to do?
[3:02:09.480 --> 3:02:10.480]  Let them die?
[3:02:10.480 --> 3:02:13.200]  The whole, the government was telling us to send them home.
[3:02:13.200 --> 3:02:18.240]  The government is still telling us, NIH, as of today, tells you, don't treat COVID, go
[3:02:18.240 --> 3:02:22.200]  home, then go to the hospital, and if the oxygen is less than 92, then you should be
[3:02:22.200 --> 3:02:23.200]  treated.
[3:02:23.200 --> 3:02:25.320]  That's the policy of a government that wants you to die.
[3:02:25.320 --> 3:02:30.320]  That's not a policy of a government that is consistent with evidence-based medicine.
[3:02:30.320 --> 3:02:35.400]  All the evidence shows that if you treat early, you reduce death by 85%.
[3:02:35.400 --> 3:02:39.920]  That's out of 600,000 dead Americans who could have kept 510,000 home.
[3:02:39.920 --> 3:02:43.600]  Forget about going to the hospital and dying.
[3:02:43.600 --> 3:02:50.000]  So any policy that obstructs early pre-hospital treatment is a policy of death, is a policy
[3:02:50.000 --> 3:02:52.160]  of the Satan.
[3:02:52.160 --> 3:02:58.160]  And this is what our government is, and I'm sorry to say this, but I have to be realistic
[3:02:58.160 --> 3:03:04.640]  and I have to protect humanity, and I feel I have to let the world know that we are being
[3:03:04.640 --> 3:03:13.720]  slaughtered by a few sociopathic corrupt oligarchs and political and corrupt governments and
[3:03:13.720 --> 3:03:21.160]  false promises, and we need to stop listening to these people saying, no, I'm not going
[3:03:21.160 --> 3:03:24.840]  to let you kill me or my family and the people I love.
[3:03:24.840 --> 3:03:25.840]  No.
[3:03:25.840 --> 3:03:29.080]  And come to my house and try to put a shot into my arm.
[3:03:29.080 --> 3:03:30.080]  Let's see what happens to you.
[3:03:30.080 --> 3:03:31.680]  You'll get a different shot.
[3:03:31.680 --> 3:03:35.360]  The difference between us and Australia now, where they're building gulags already and
[3:03:35.360 --> 3:03:40.760]  then turning people into quarantine facilities and putting ankle braces on people who don't
[3:03:40.760 --> 3:03:45.960]  want to take the shot, is that we have 450 million guns.
[3:03:45.960 --> 3:03:47.040]  And the government knows that.
[3:03:47.040 --> 3:03:51.440]  That's why Biden's administration hasn't sent in stormtroopers into each individual
[3:03:51.440 --> 3:03:55.600]  house forcing you to get this vaccine, because they know they're going to get shot.
[3:03:55.600 --> 3:04:00.800]  And by the way, we've now confirmed they are calling the CDC people at their houses and
[3:04:00.800 --> 3:04:04.320]  admitting they have a database saying, you're not vaccinated, you should take it.
[3:04:04.320 --> 3:04:08.160]  That is a total violation of people's health rights, isn't it?
[3:04:08.160 --> 3:04:19.160]  It's a setup for a police state forced vaccination, literally forced murder.
[3:04:19.160 --> 3:04:20.160]  Absolutely.
[3:04:20.160 --> 3:04:25.800]  We're back in 60 seconds and I want to back up what you're saying with just on its face
[3:04:25.800 --> 3:04:30.640]  evidence, primal facial evidence, that they're not just saying, oh, you're sick, go home
[3:04:30.640 --> 3:04:32.200]  and wait until we put you on a ventilator.
[3:04:32.200 --> 3:04:37.320]  Oh, they're trying to block the treatments, which we now know they know work and they
[3:04:37.320 --> 3:04:38.440]  have the studies.
[3:04:38.440 --> 3:04:43.160]  And now they're creating clones of what doctors and linko and others discovered.
[3:04:43.160 --> 3:04:44.160]  It's just incredible.
[3:04:44.160 --> 3:04:47.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is World War three.
[3:04:47.160 --> 3:04:48.560]  This is the great reset.
[3:04:48.560 --> 3:04:55.920]  This is the world we know it being destroyed on its ashes, the build back better program.
[3:04:55.920 --> 3:05:01.760]  So if you understand that this is not FDA approved, it's totally experimental.
[3:05:01.760 --> 3:05:05.400]  It's never been given to human beings before.
[3:05:05.400 --> 3:05:12.640]  Some of the ingredients inside of these shots have never been injected in human beings before.
[3:05:12.640 --> 3:05:15.000]  There are no long term studies.
[3:05:15.000 --> 3:05:19.440]  We don't know what's going to happen inside your body somewhere four to six weeks after
[3:05:19.440 --> 3:05:24.400]  your second injection or four to six months or even two years.
[3:05:24.400 --> 3:05:30.200]  We have no idea whether it's going to cause infertility, whether it's going to cause cancer,
[3:05:30.200 --> 3:05:33.280]  how bad your autoimmune disease is going to be.
[3:05:33.280 --> 3:05:36.960]  My conclusion after looking at this for a long time and listening to the arguments for
[3:05:36.960 --> 3:05:41.880]  these masks, I determined that if you believe, if you're a medical doctor or a scientist
[3:05:41.880 --> 3:05:47.160]  that is spouting using these masks, you're either being played or you're being paid.

[3:06:16.160 --> 3:06:21.920]  That's when we're ready to come back.
[3:06:21.920 --> 3:06:34.880]  So I'm considering I'd like you to court keep and thank you.
[3:06:34.880 --> 3:06:45.100]  Thanks for reading it.
[3:06:45.100 --> 3:07:14.420]  I really appreciate you joining us, and I'd like him to recap and then continue on, but
[3:07:14.420 --> 3:07:18.980]  like you said, we're synpotico on this, we're synced up because we're all living in
[3:07:18.980 --> 3:07:23.860]  the same world, seeing the same thing, we've already proven they're poisoning us, we've
[3:07:23.860 --> 3:07:26.780]  already proven it doesn't work, we're already proven in their own documents, they're doing
[3:07:26.780 --> 3:07:30.860]  it for authoritarian power and control, and the people running it, quote, meet in secret
[3:07:30.860 --> 3:07:35.100]  to discuss plans for global forced depopulation, that's Wall Street Journal.
[3:07:35.100 --> 3:07:39.500]  So I've been warning of this for 30 years, I've been on air 28, but I was involved politically
[3:07:39.500 --> 3:07:43.900]  before them because I learned about this reading history books, and I also had family
[3:07:43.900 --> 3:07:48.740]  that had done things and been places that knew about this, my mother's brother who's
[3:07:48.740 --> 3:07:53.820]  dead now, worked in secret operations at the Pentagon and Iran Contra and other things,
[3:07:53.820 --> 3:08:00.900]  and he told me all this, and my dad, they tried to recruit him and told him all this stuff
[3:08:00.900 --> 3:08:05.220]  at UT when he was in high school and wanted to UT, so I grew up knowing this was the plan,
[3:08:05.220 --> 3:08:09.860]  then I'm living it now, okay, so I was blessed to have people in my family that knew about
[3:08:09.860 --> 3:08:13.500]  that and told me what was really going on, okay?
[3:08:13.500 --> 3:08:16.980]  My dad didn't tell me until I came out with in-game 14 years ago, he hadn't told me very
[3:08:16.980 --> 3:08:20.980]  much, my mother didn't know, she saw the film and said, David, this can't be this bad, he
[3:08:20.980 --> 3:08:25.460]  said, no, actually, that's what they said when I was 15 and went to UT and they recruited
[3:08:25.460 --> 3:08:31.580]  me in when the top test scores and they admitted it all, so this has been a long-term plan,
[3:08:31.580 --> 3:08:35.380]  and they told my dad, they said, look, Hitler was bad, he went after one or two groups, we're
[3:08:35.380 --> 3:08:38.820]  gonna go after everybody, and my dad's like, I'm getting out of this, they didn't tell
[3:08:38.820 --> 3:08:45.340]  me when I was 18, actually, at UT, so that's how real this all is, my dad's a very private
[3:08:45.340 --> 3:08:48.860]  person, but I should get him on here to tell you all this, he sat there with the head of
[3:08:48.860 --> 3:08:55.540]  the UT Botany Department, Professor Spear, and he told this to his face, so that's the
[3:08:55.540 --> 3:08:59.540]  real world, my mom's like, I remember having dinner with Spear when we went to UT, so that's
[3:08:59.540 --> 3:09:03.980]  the level my dad was at in this and he got out of it, so Dr. Zalinko's here with us,
[3:09:03.980 --> 3:09:07.340]  but to me the biggest proof isn't just the science, the facts, the research, all the
[3:09:07.340 --> 3:09:11.060]  admissions, the skyrocketing heart attacks and blood clots that you predicted and others
[3:09:11.060 --> 3:09:16.620]  did, it's them trying to block hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and now trying to ration Regeneron
[3:09:16.620 --> 3:09:21.740]  and trying to do all this and then most secretly making it themselves and preparing drugs, I
[3:09:21.740 --> 3:09:28.740]  guess for them, it's just, but you said it on another show, coming to grips with something,
[3:09:28.740 --> 3:09:34.180]  this evil, this out of control is hard for the average person, because I'm, I'm, I'm,
[3:09:34.180 --> 3:09:38.500]  I think a tough guy, I can barely handle it, you're obviously a smart tough guy, you can
[3:09:38.500 --> 3:09:42.380]  I can see having trouble, but you're facing it and I just, how do we get the general public
[3:09:42.380 --> 3:09:47.140]  that just has a normalcy bias to not be in Stockholm syndrome and come out of this and
[3:09:47.140 --> 3:09:51.940]  then what do we do to oppose this, you said war footing is what's needed, so please tell
[3:09:51.940 --> 3:09:55.740]  us what a war footing is and speak to that, because this is the rest of our lives, this
[3:09:55.740 --> 3:09:59.820]  is the big war, this is a covert operation, they admit it and we're in it right now,
[3:09:59.820 --> 3:10:09.580]  what do we do, so I'm not trying to save everyone, what, what I believe is the quality
[3:10:09.580 --> 3:10:13.340]  of opportunity, not a quality of outcome, that's the difference between capitalism
[3:10:13.340 --> 3:10:18.180]  and communism, in other words, I don't think everyone needs to survive, I think everyone
[3:10:18.180 --> 3:10:23.260]  needs to have all their information presented to them, so they can make their own intelligent
[3:10:23.260 --> 3:10:28.580]  choices, use their consciousness and free will to choose, but in order to choose, you have
[3:10:28.580 --> 3:10:33.340]  to have all their information, so I've made it a mission in my life, no matter how much
[3:10:33.340 --> 3:10:40.500]  life I have left in me, to inform the world about account or narratives that people can
[3:10:40.500 --> 3:10:45.340]  make educated, intelligent decisions, and again, don't trust me, verify everything that
[3:10:45.340 --> 3:10:50.140]  I'm saying, so in other words, I believe that God is testing every single human being and
[3:10:50.140 --> 3:10:57.140]  I think this is the test that he's had enough of paganism, child sacrifice, idol worship
[3:10:57.140 --> 3:11:02.220]  and what he's done is created a system where each individual human being is forced to make
[3:11:02.220 --> 3:11:06.460]  a binary choice, are you going to bow down to the creator, are you going to bow down
[3:11:06.460 --> 3:11:11.300]  and ask him for salvation because he's making you every second as a gift, happy birthday
[3:11:11.300 --> 3:11:14.900]  Alex, he just made you, or are you going to bow down to the false gods and the false
[3:11:14.900 --> 3:11:19.660]  promises and golden calf of the vaccine and the sociopaths and corrupt governments, because
[3:11:19.660 --> 3:11:23.100]  if that's the angle you choose, then let them protect you, let's see how that's going
[3:11:23.100 --> 3:11:28.620]  to work out for you, but ultimately I think that that's the choice, it's individual, Carl
[3:11:28.620 --> 3:11:32.740]  Young the psychoanalyst said that the moral degradation of the society begins with the
[3:11:32.740 --> 3:11:37.620]  degradation of the individual, by the opposite you can learn out that the moral improvement
[3:11:37.620 --> 3:11:41.900]  of the society begins with the moral refinement of the individual, so I can't control what
[3:11:41.900 --> 3:11:46.260]  you Alex do, but I can control what I do, how I think, how I speak and how I act and
[3:11:46.260 --> 3:11:52.820]  how I respect God's creation by sanctifying life and I think that is required on the individual
[3:11:52.820 --> 3:11:57.660]  basis to turn away from bad and to do good and live, that's the prescription of King
[3:11:57.660 --> 3:12:02.740]  David, he says it and the Psalms of David, turn away from bad which means stay away from
[3:12:02.740 --> 3:12:07.540]  the poison death shot, don't live in fear, don't live in isolation, do good means take
[3:12:07.540 --> 3:12:13.700]  early treatment and prophylaxis if you're high risk and you'll live, do not give in
[3:12:13.700 --> 3:12:20.580]  or submit to the tyranny because they are very astute at dividing us and making us believe
[3:12:20.580 --> 3:12:25.940]  that we're isolated, in reality there's many, many more of us, we have more guns than them,
[3:12:25.940 --> 3:12:30.940]  they're afraid of the enemies, afraid of an informed public that will coalesce together
[3:12:30.940 --> 3:12:36.660]  and just turn around, let me ask you what would stop, why is it the one Nazi guard with
[3:12:36.660 --> 3:12:42.260]  a German shepherd and a machine gun could corral 2,000 Jews to their death in a gas chamber
[3:12:42.260 --> 3:12:48.100]  and the answer is very simple because they were able to demoralize and isolate and create
[3:12:48.100 --> 3:12:53.700]  fear in the psychology of the victims so that they had no resolve to fight back, what would
[3:12:53.700 --> 3:12:59.180]  it have taken for them to turn around and stop this guy, this guard to death, there's
[3:12:59.180 --> 3:13:05.180]  2,000 of them, there's one of him, so that's the key here, we could turn around and look
[3:13:05.180 --> 3:13:12.140]  the enemy into the eye and say no, we're not going to submit to your tyranny, you can go
[3:13:12.140 --> 3:13:17.340]  burn in hell and you will burn in hell in this world and in the world to come, okay,
[3:13:17.340 --> 3:13:21.860]  you want to start a war, so let's start the war, let's really start it, let's stop playing
[3:13:21.860 --> 3:13:26.740]  games anymore, let's bring it to the surface and let's see which side is going to be left
[3:13:26.740 --> 3:13:27.740]  standing.
[3:13:27.740 --> 3:13:32.380]  I agree, let's talk about standing up saying no, I think we have to fully identify it and
[3:13:32.380 --> 3:13:36.140]  not eat around the edges like Rand Paul or eat around the edges like others, we have
[3:13:36.140 --> 3:13:39.180]  to come, because I talked to a lot of these guys behind the scenes, they know all this
[3:13:39.180 --> 3:13:42.580]  stuff, they're smart too, but they just think the public can't handle it, the only thing
[3:13:42.580 --> 3:13:46.660]  that's going to save us is the truth, isn't that right?
[3:13:46.660 --> 3:13:53.020]  The truth is what leaves a good decision making, there are some people that are, if you study
[3:13:53.020 --> 3:13:58.980]  biblical history, you'll see that only 20% of the Jews left Egypt, 80% chose to stay
[3:13:58.980 --> 3:14:05.860]  and die in slavery and out of those 20% that left Egypt, 50% or so died in the desert,
[3:14:05.860 --> 3:14:11.900]  so only one out of 10 Jews were able to leave Egyptian slavery or slave mentality and make
[3:14:11.900 --> 3:14:18.340]  it to Israel or the redemptive thinking required to live in Israel, and I don't see it much
[3:14:18.340 --> 3:14:23.340]  different now, there's only around 10% of humanity that is capable of making a psychological
[3:14:23.340 --> 3:14:29.500]  transition from being a slave to man to being a servant of a god, I hope that number increases
[3:14:29.500 --> 3:14:35.220]  and I do believe in the power of human choice and I do believe that every single individual
[3:14:35.220 --> 3:14:43.100]  has the potential to turn away from bad and do good and to choose God, now is that Alexander
[3:14:43.100 --> 3:14:44.100]  Sol's mission?
[3:14:44.100 --> 3:14:45.100]  Yes, there is.
[3:14:45.100 --> 3:14:50.060]  I want to share a story from his book, Gulag Archipelago, which changed my life, I was
[3:14:50.060 --> 3:14:54.980]  going to say it before, I can't believe you brought him up, so he writes in his book,
[3:14:54.980 --> 3:15:01.540]  it's a 2700 page scream at the horrors of what human beings are capable of doing, he
[3:15:01.540 --> 3:15:07.340]  survived Stalin's Gulags, so he writes that Stalin wanted to build a canal from Moscow
[3:15:07.340 --> 3:15:13.980]  to another city, he used the Gulag prisoners to do it, 400,000 died, their corpses were
[3:15:13.980 --> 3:15:19.500]  entombed in the cement that were part of the canal, when the canal was finished not one
[3:15:19.500 --> 3:15:25.380]  ship ever used it because it was too shallow, so the question was why was this canal built?
[3:15:25.380 --> 3:15:29.620]  The answer was that 400,000 people should die.
[3:15:29.620 --> 3:15:30.620]  Wow.
[3:15:30.620 --> 3:15:35.180]  And that's what we're going through right now, people don't realize this, this is a
[3:15:35.180 --> 3:15:39.620]  process of people calling, but I really think this is what they're saying.
[3:15:39.620 --> 3:15:42.020]  Hold on, don't stay there, hard breaks with the satellites, let's come back and get into
[3:15:42.020 --> 3:15:46.260]  that and talk about how they want us to worship them, the governor of New York said, I am
[3:15:46.260 --> 3:15:50.340]  your priestess and God talks to me and you are my disciples and those that don't take
[3:15:50.340 --> 3:15:55.100]  the shot, they don't talk to God, wow.
[3:15:55.100 --> 3:15:59.220]  What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood-burning fireplace
[3:15:59.220 --> 3:16:01.380]  and not spend thousands doing it?

[3:16:30.460 --> 3:16:34.620]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling,
[3:16:34.620 --> 3:16:37.340]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[3:16:37.340 --> 3:16:41.700]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[3:16:41.700 --> 3:16:44.620]  You probably already believe that, I certainly do.
[3:16:44.620 --> 3:16:48.940]  So here's the thing, I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based
[3:16:48.940 --> 3:16:54.100]  substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.

[3:17:24.020 --> 3:17:26.460]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:17:26.460 --> 3:17:30.380]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:17:30.380 --> 3:17:31.940]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:17:31.940 --> 3:17:34.900]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:17:34.900 --> 3:17:38.180]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[3:17:38.180 --> 3:17:40.420]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[3:17:40.420 --> 3:17:41.740]  I can help you too.
[3:17:41.740 --> 3:17:44.780]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[3:17:44.780 --> 3:17:46.980]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[3:17:46.980 --> 3:17:56.060]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:17:56.060 --> 3:18:00.220]  In addition, we were really finding that we were stressing the cardiopulmonary systems
[3:18:00.220 --> 3:18:04.500]  of these employees because when you cover the mouth and nose and you exert physical
[3:18:04.500 --> 3:18:09.540]  energy during your work, during your tasks, whatever it might be, you're really stressing
[3:18:09.540 --> 3:18:12.620]  the cardiopulmonary system because you change the way that you breathe.
[3:18:12.620 --> 3:18:15.980]  You have to forcibly inhale and forcibly exhale.
[3:18:15.980 --> 3:18:17.500]  It taxes the heart.
[3:18:17.500 --> 3:18:22.980]  It taxes the lungs, and we have given people heart attacks by allowing them to work with
[3:18:22.980 --> 3:18:30.260]  their mouth and nose covered with absolutely no regulation, no oversight, no medical oversight.
[3:18:30.260 --> 3:18:32.460]  The globalists have told us we're a disease.
[3:18:32.460 --> 3:18:35.580]  They've told us they want to eradicate us, and all the studies show that when you wear
[3:18:35.580 --> 3:18:41.140]  these masks, it lowers your oxygen level up to one-third and gives you dangerous levels
[3:18:41.140 --> 3:18:43.340]  of carbon dioxide poisoning.
[3:18:43.340 --> 3:18:46.020]  This is a sick cult, and we've got to say no.
[3:18:46.020 --> 3:18:50.180]  But the only way the real science comes out of the public is if we tell them, get your
[3:18:50.180 --> 3:18:53.140]  copy today of COVIDland and expose them.
[3:18:53.140 --> 3:18:54.380]  It's covidland.com.
[3:18:54.380 --> 3:18:57.020]  Go there now.
[3:18:57.020 --> 3:19:00.940]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul.
[3:19:00.940 --> 3:19:06.620]  I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet, I've had a lot of loss, like everybody else
[3:19:06.620 --> 3:19:07.620]  has.
[3:19:07.620 --> 3:19:17.180]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died
[3:19:17.180 --> 3:19:23.180]  and bled and sweat for, and now we're just throwing it all away.
[3:19:23.180 --> 3:19:28.860]  And I see the general public in a medically induced, scientifically induced behavioral
[3:19:28.860 --> 3:19:35.700]  psychologically controlled tranche, and I know we're being fed into this globalist meat
[3:19:35.700 --> 3:19:42.140]  around here and it's so incredibly sad, but this is the process of birth and then growth
[3:19:42.140 --> 3:19:47.020]  and then falling apart and then degenerating and collapsing and then coming back to life
[3:19:47.020 --> 3:19:48.020]  again.
[3:19:48.020 --> 3:19:52.740]  It's just the globalist are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence
[3:19:52.740 --> 3:19:58.940]  and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[3:19:58.940 --> 3:20:17.740]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:17.740 --> 3:20:21.940]  Alexander Sholzenitsyn, the gulag archipelago, how we burn in the camps later wishing we
[3:20:21.940 --> 3:20:24.380]  would have stood up and fought to paraphrase him.
[3:20:24.380 --> 3:20:27.820]  And yes, I never read the whole book, I'll be honest, it's heavy reading, but I have
[3:20:27.820 --> 3:20:32.060]  read probably 500 pages of it, I think I read like in College of Boil Down version of it,
[3:20:32.060 --> 3:20:39.260]  a major amended or a bridged version, but Dr. Zelenko, you were here on the Alex Jones
[3:20:39.260 --> 3:20:46.780]  show getting into the fact that Stalin built a system that a canal that didn't work because
[3:20:46.780 --> 3:20:50.420]  that was just the whole cover of working people to death, starving them to death.
[3:20:50.420 --> 3:20:55.220]  I mean, that's the plan, I mean, Lenin was asked, how many villagers do we kill?
[3:20:55.220 --> 3:20:56.660]  They're submitting, sir, they've surrendered.
[3:20:56.660 --> 3:21:00.580]  They want to, he just said, I'll just kill half of them, I want fear.
[3:21:00.580 --> 3:21:05.780]  But like you said, it's a spiritual thing and they sexually Hitler would, this is in
[3:21:05.780 --> 3:21:09.900]  Nazi writings, he's not made up stuff about him, would sit there during the Eastern front
[3:21:09.900 --> 3:21:15.580]  and go out to it by train and just stay at 20 hours looking through binoculars and telescopes
[3:21:15.580 --> 3:21:16.740]  at burning and bombing.
[3:21:16.740 --> 3:21:19.020]  He just loved death and loved it all.
[3:21:19.020 --> 3:21:22.220]  So for him, it was, you know, the journey was the destination.
[3:21:22.220 --> 3:21:23.220]  Is that what you're getting at?
[3:21:23.220 --> 3:21:36.300]  Yeah, the forces of evil derive this perverse pleasure in the destruction of the world of
[3:21:36.300 --> 3:21:37.700]  humanity.
[3:21:37.700 --> 3:21:48.740]  Their hatred of themselves is so complete that they are willing to watch the entire world
[3:21:48.740 --> 3:21:58.980]  burn in order to quell their feelings of inadequacy of themselves because of other people.
[3:21:58.980 --> 3:22:05.220]  So in other words, if you look at the Bible, interesting story, Cain and Abel, two brothers,
[3:22:05.220 --> 3:22:07.740]  they both bring offerings to God.
[3:22:07.740 --> 3:22:12.140]  God chooses Abel's offering and not Cain's, so God set up a dominance hierarchy.
[3:22:12.140 --> 3:22:13.780]  We're not all equal, are we?
[3:22:13.780 --> 3:22:15.700]  So Cain got upset, right?
[3:22:15.700 --> 3:22:18.940]  So what did God do?
[3:22:18.940 --> 3:22:21.260]  He came to him and said, why are you depressed?
[3:22:21.260 --> 3:22:23.740]  Improve yourself and I'll take your offering as well.
[3:22:23.740 --> 3:22:24.740]  What did he do?
[3:22:24.740 --> 3:22:25.740]  He killed the competition.
[3:22:25.740 --> 3:22:26.740]  He killed his brother.
[3:22:26.740 --> 3:22:27.740]  That's human history in a nutshell.
[3:22:27.740 --> 3:22:32.900]  Now there's another, instead of taking personal responsibility for your own character flaws,
[3:22:32.900 --> 3:22:37.780]  your own inadequacies, if something went wrong in your life, look inside yourself and improve
[3:22:37.780 --> 3:22:43.540]  yourself, rather it's much easier to blame the other person who is doing well and is
[3:22:43.540 --> 3:22:48.500]  working hard and is putting into honest effort because that person makes you look inadequate.
[3:22:48.500 --> 3:22:51.380]  Instead of working on yourself, you kill him.
[3:22:51.380 --> 3:22:53.220]  That's history in a nutshell.
[3:22:53.220 --> 3:22:54.740]  That's Bill Gates.
[3:22:54.740 --> 3:23:03.420]  So I really think that we do need military tribunals where these animals are brought
[3:23:03.420 --> 3:23:10.780]  to justice and there should be a trial and once they're found for guilty of capital murder,
[3:23:10.780 --> 3:23:16.700]  crimes against humanity, crimes, genocidal crimes, they should be hung or shot or executed
[3:23:16.700 --> 3:23:23.940]  and their corpses should be left as an example for future aspiring despots and want to be
[3:23:23.940 --> 3:23:28.260]  tyrants that this is going to happen to you as well.
[3:23:28.260 --> 3:23:33.340]  I agree with you that the historically tyrants have lost over and so now they've got the
[3:23:33.340 --> 3:23:39.020]  sophisticated hidden plan and I agree they need to know that humanity is getting on a
[3:23:39.020 --> 3:23:40.020]  war footing.
[3:23:40.020 --> 3:23:41.020]  I think they know that.
[3:23:41.020 --> 3:23:44.980]  I think their plan was going well at first but that's how all these big conquests go
[3:23:44.980 --> 3:23:49.460]  but the deeper they get in, the more they push and the fact that people now know that
[3:23:49.460 --> 3:23:53.860]  long before the shots even started, we all predicted you and others could see that they
[3:23:53.860 --> 3:23:55.660]  would then blame the unvaccinated.
[3:23:55.660 --> 3:23:59.100]  More and more people aren't buying this and it doesn't look like the censorship is working
[3:23:59.100 --> 3:24:00.100]  like they thought.
[3:24:00.100 --> 3:24:05.180]  If you had to score this as a macabre football game or sporting event or boxing match with
[3:24:05.180 --> 3:24:11.020]  12 rounds, where would you say the forces of pro-humanity, pro-God are versus the forces
[3:24:11.020 --> 3:24:15.420]  like the governor of New York that says I'm God, you're my disciples, God tells me what
[3:24:15.420 --> 3:24:18.620]  to do if you don't do what I say, you're against God.
[3:24:18.620 --> 3:24:22.100]  How do we fight this cult?
[3:24:22.100 --> 3:24:29.300]  By destroying it and you destroy it by first adhering to principles of truth, of self-refinement
[3:24:29.300 --> 3:24:35.580]  and accepting monotheism and realizing that it requires a little humility, no one has
[3:24:35.580 --> 3:24:41.940]  God in their pocket, no one could say I know what God wants, no religion, no, whenever
[3:24:41.940 --> 3:24:46.940]  I hear any institution say I know exactly what God wants, I always stay away from them.
[3:24:46.940 --> 3:24:51.540]  We could say I think that this is what God wants, I'm not God's accountant, I don't know
[3:24:51.540 --> 3:24:53.540]  for sure, but we can-
[3:24:53.540 --> 3:24:56.700]  It's very blasphemous, anybody saying they know what God wants, they're saying they're
[3:24:56.700 --> 3:24:57.700]  God.
[3:24:57.700 --> 3:25:00.860]  They're saying listen to me, I'm God.
[3:25:00.860 --> 3:25:10.260]  Yeah, so, you know, Pharaoh from in the Bible used to hide the fact that he was a human
[3:25:10.260 --> 3:25:15.300]  being by going to defecate by the Nile River early in the morning so people wouldn't see
[3:25:15.300 --> 3:25:18.700]  him defecate because he wanted the God illusion.
[3:25:18.700 --> 3:25:24.580]  So that's all desks are always trying to hide their so-called humanity and appear-
[3:25:24.580 --> 3:25:28.980]  Hitler was the same, taking six, seven showers a day and sneaking off to go to the bathroom,
[3:25:28.980 --> 3:25:29.980]  that's a fact.
[3:25:29.980 --> 3:25:32.580]  And we see that a lot, don't we, with these types?
[3:25:32.580 --> 3:25:44.380]  I mean, these are our perversion to the ultimate extreme because what is the opposite of perversion?
[3:25:44.380 --> 3:25:52.700]  Which is to align all your drives and all your God-given gifts with the will of God,
[3:25:52.700 --> 3:26:01.180]  insects including lust for power, all that could be sublimated and used in a divine purpose.
[3:26:01.180 --> 3:26:06.300]  What real perversion is, is people taking their base qualities and refusing to refine
[3:26:06.300 --> 3:26:14.060]  them and using them as an instrument of evil, of getting their name known over that of the
[3:26:14.060 --> 3:26:15.060]  name of God.
[3:26:15.060 --> 3:26:17.820]  See, I don't care if the world knows my name or not, it's not about me.
[3:26:17.820 --> 3:26:23.660]  I wouldn't mind if God's name is sanctified because of perhaps my life, but it's not about
[3:26:23.660 --> 3:26:24.660]  me at all.
[3:26:24.660 --> 3:26:29.300]  Actually, the more I get myself out of the picture, the more useful and effective I become.
[3:26:29.300 --> 3:26:37.140]  So that's the difference between a true spiritual, let's say, healthy approach, a leader versus
[3:26:37.140 --> 3:26:38.140]  a cult leader.
[3:26:38.140 --> 3:26:42.180]  Because a true spiritual leader, what he tries to do, what she tries to do, is connect you
[3:26:42.180 --> 3:26:44.860]  to God by getting themselves out of the way.
[3:26:44.860 --> 3:26:52.420]  There's nothing more pleasurable for a true leader to see his students prosper without
[3:26:52.420 --> 3:26:55.420]  the leader's influence.
[3:26:55.420 --> 3:26:57.380]  I want my students to become leaders.
[3:26:57.380 --> 3:26:59.180]  I want my children to become leaders.
[3:26:59.180 --> 3:27:01.340]  And then take care of us later.
[3:27:01.340 --> 3:27:04.660]  That's what we're supposed to do, is empower the next generation to take care of us.
[3:27:04.660 --> 3:27:06.540]  They do the same and we have a family.
[3:27:06.540 --> 3:27:11.060]  You know, I saw a t-shirt, it'd be nice to your kids, they'd choose your nursing home.
[3:27:11.060 --> 3:27:21.820]  But the despots and the cultists amongst us, what they like to do is not connect you to
[3:27:21.820 --> 3:27:27.180]  or free you so that your soul becomes a free flying birdie and is able to connect to the
[3:27:27.180 --> 3:27:34.140]  Creator without them, but rather make you co-dependent on them or everything.
[3:27:34.140 --> 3:27:35.820]  And that's what we're seeing happening now.
[3:27:35.820 --> 3:27:41.460]  It's a fight between two mentalities, two systems that can't coexist.
[3:27:41.460 --> 3:27:49.980]  There's the God mentality, there's the drive within us to live in a God-consciousness way
[3:27:49.980 --> 3:27:55.260]  and to experience true freedom, because when you put on the yoke of the head and you take
[3:27:55.260 --> 3:27:59.980]  off the yoke of your own insecurities, your own inadequacies, and that of the opinions
[3:27:59.980 --> 3:28:00.980]  of other people.
[3:28:00.980 --> 3:28:01.980]  Oh, absolutely.
[3:28:01.980 --> 3:28:05.260]  The more I deline myself with God and make myself get out of the way of the freer I am
[3:28:05.260 --> 3:28:08.580]  and the more I understand it, it's like, this is ridiculous.
[3:28:08.580 --> 3:28:09.980]  Why don't the Satanists know this?
[3:28:09.980 --> 3:28:13.180]  The power and the freedom of getting aligned with God is incredible.
[3:28:13.180 --> 3:28:17.860]  There's a saying that I don't know if I thought of it, but it makes sense to me, that there's
[3:28:17.860 --> 3:28:22.420]  only one type of free person in the world and that someone who chooses, the operative
[3:28:22.420 --> 3:28:26.340]  word here is chooses, to be a slave to God.
[3:28:26.340 --> 3:28:27.340]  Absolutely.
[3:28:27.340 --> 3:28:32.820]  Whereas Satan, the serpent, tricks you into it and thinking you're going to be God, you
[3:28:32.820 --> 3:28:36.100]  become a slave.
[3:28:36.100 --> 3:28:40.500]  That's the, that's the, that's the interesting nuance, the irony of it.
[3:28:40.500 --> 3:28:41.820]  All right, final segment.
[3:28:41.820 --> 3:28:42.820]  This is amazing.
[3:28:42.820 --> 3:28:47.060]  I want to come back with a Joe Rogan clip and I want to tell people about ZStackLife.com.
[3:28:47.060 --> 3:28:50.020]  This is something big brother to them when you know about it and I'm 100% behind it.
[3:28:50.020 --> 3:28:55.100]  ZStackLife.com, Alex Jones, stay with us.
[3:28:55.100 --> 3:29:00.100]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:29:00.100 --> 3:29:06.340]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer, for financial support
[3:29:06.340 --> 3:29:10.420]  and for word of mouth and then we're all in this together and I, you know, it gets old
[3:29:10.420 --> 3:29:13.340]  having to come to you and say, Hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't
[3:29:13.340 --> 3:29:14.340]  be here on air.
[3:29:14.340 --> 3:29:17.740]  But it's true for the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty
[3:29:17.740 --> 3:29:22.300]  at this level that is not beholden to the big corporate sponsors and they've harassed
[3:29:22.300 --> 3:29:23.620]  and almost shut down everybody else.
[3:29:23.620 --> 3:29:27.940]  They crippled all the other groups and we're still here and as this whole new world order
[3:29:27.940 --> 3:29:30.860]  comes out and we open, our credibility is going up.
[3:29:30.860 --> 3:29:32.420]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:29:32.420 --> 3:29:34.500]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:29:34.500 --> 3:29:38.220]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America is still quasi free.
[3:29:38.220 --> 3:29:43.100]  You can't have info wars has been proven right, be on air with all the craziness that's about
[3:29:43.100 --> 3:29:44.100]  to unfold.
[3:29:44.100 --> 3:29:46.100]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.

[3:31:03.260 --> 3:31:04.260]  Go ahead.
[3:31:04.260 --> 3:31:06.460]  Challenge, first of all, let me say I love your products.
[3:31:06.460 --> 3:31:11.980]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[3:31:11.980 --> 3:31:17.460]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[3:31:17.460 --> 3:31:23.460]  Since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin has just really gorgeous actually.
[3:31:23.460 --> 3:31:29.540]  People think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought,
[3:31:29.540 --> 3:31:33.300]  you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless
[3:31:33.300 --> 3:31:34.300]  situation.
[3:31:34.300 --> 3:31:38.940]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period
[3:31:38.940 --> 3:31:44.100]  of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is
[3:31:44.100 --> 3:31:45.100]  wonderful.
[3:31:45.100 --> 3:31:51.460]  You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully
[3:31:51.460 --> 3:32:21.300]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[3:32:21.300 --> 3:32:44.940]  I also need you to wear a mask and maybe also need you to only thing, that way we can consolidate
[3:32:44.940 --> 3:32:46.140]  control.
[3:32:46.140 --> 3:32:49.460]  Even companies that profits.
[3:32:49.460 --> 3:32:55.460]  You'll move your immune system, so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[3:33:19.460 --> 3:33:31.460]  I've always had a sixth sense for danger, and as I've gotten older it's gotten stronger.
[3:33:31.460 --> 3:33:37.460]  I mean, I pay attention to it, but now it's a thousand times what it's ever been.
[3:33:37.460 --> 3:33:43.460]  I use the Lord of the Rings analogy when Bilbo Baggins has that elf sword when goblins are near and start shining blue.
[3:33:43.460 --> 3:33:50.460]  Well, it's white hot blue right now, and you can see it all, and a lot of people subconsciously I believe know this is bad,
[3:33:50.460 --> 3:33:54.460]  know they're being attacked, and so they internalize that fear and aren't sure why,
[3:33:54.460 --> 3:34:01.460]  but then consciously, under Stockholm syndrome, Mass Stockholm syndrome, bow down to their abusers,
[3:34:01.460 --> 3:34:11.460]  even though deep down they know the truth, and then they also demonize people like Dr. Bartlett,
[3:34:11.460 --> 3:34:14.460]  where they've been attacking nationwide, Howard Stern attacked him and saying,
[3:34:14.460 --> 3:34:21.460]  oh, he's just doing that for money when he recommends a online pharmacy site that he has nothing to do with,
[3:34:21.460 --> 3:34:24.460]  so people can get ivermectin and budesodine and things.
[3:34:24.460 --> 3:34:26.460]  That's evil, but I'm of this thought.
[3:34:26.460 --> 3:34:30.460]  I'm like, why doesn't Dr. Bartlett write a book and become more successful?
[3:34:30.460 --> 3:34:32.460]  He's already advisor to multiple governors.
[3:34:32.460 --> 3:34:37.460]  Why are we ashamed that we have businesses and we help people and we sell good products?
[3:34:37.460 --> 3:34:42.460]  I want somebody that sells good cars, good medicine, good food, good clothing,
[3:34:42.460 --> 3:34:46.460]  but see, then oh, good people, we're not supposed to even have our thing in the marketplace of ideas,
[3:34:46.460 --> 3:34:51.460]  so I'm really glad that Dr. Zelinko doesn't let the system intimidate him,
[3:34:51.460 --> 3:34:54.460]  and he did this really out of need because nobody else was doing it.
[3:34:54.460 --> 3:35:00.460]  He came out with the Z-stack, it's a specifically formulated supplement that includes zinc,
[3:35:00.460 --> 3:35:07.460]  quercetin, vitamin C and vitamin D, and quercetin, again, does the same thing as those dreaded things that the system's been attacking.
[3:35:07.460 --> 3:35:13.460]  Formulated by Dr. Vladimir Zelinko, the world-renowned doctor that President Trump credited with his successful early treatment protocol
[3:35:13.460 --> 3:35:16.460]  as a decision to take hydroxychloroquine.
[3:35:16.460 --> 3:35:20.460]  And he reached out to us and said, hey, would you like to an affiliate program,
[3:35:20.460 --> 3:35:22.460]  and it's been great, listeners are checking it out.
[3:35:22.460 --> 3:35:26.460]  It is a great product, zstacklife.com, and I think everybody should get it,
[3:35:26.460 --> 3:35:29.460]  and you should stockpile it, you should share it with family that doesn't know what's going on,
[3:35:29.460 --> 3:35:31.460]  because this is good for your health, period.
[3:35:31.460 --> 3:35:41.460]  zstacklife.com forward slash Alex in order today, zstacklife.com forward slash Alex there on zstacklife.com.
[3:35:41.460 --> 3:35:44.460]  But regardless, get prepared, get ready.
[3:35:44.460 --> 3:35:47.460]  And that's my next question up for you, Dr.
[3:35:47.460 --> 3:35:56.460]  With all these people with the blood clots and all the rest of it and the heart attacks increasing and the antibody enhancement syndrome and all this,
[3:35:56.460 --> 3:36:00.460]  a lot of people call me, not a lot, tons call me and email me and ask me on the street.
[3:36:00.460 --> 3:36:04.460]  Ask next time Zelinko's on one of those other great doctors.
[3:36:04.460 --> 3:36:07.460]  I took the shot or my wife did, we didn't know what do we do.
[3:36:07.460 --> 3:36:10.460]  And I know you can't do medicine from afar.
[3:36:10.460 --> 3:36:11.460]  I'm not a doctor. I can't.
[3:36:11.460 --> 3:36:13.460]  But I'm just, what do I say?
[3:36:13.460 --> 3:36:14.460]  Sorry, can't help you?
[3:36:14.460 --> 3:36:17.460]  Or is there a way to detox or we just don't know enough yet?
[3:36:17.460 --> 3:36:24.460]  I think the answer is yes to everything you just said, but there are tactics that will help someone.
[3:36:24.460 --> 3:36:31.460]  And, and depends where you are after the shot within the first three months, the main threat to your life is blood clots.
[3:36:31.460 --> 3:36:36.460]  But obviously it would make sense to take blood thinners during that period of time.
[3:36:36.460 --> 3:36:45.460]  So either aspirin or the more advanced blood thinners, especially if you have a blood clotting predisposition or your pregnant.
[3:36:45.460 --> 3:36:48.460]  But that risk of blood clots fades after three months.
[3:36:48.460 --> 3:36:52.460]  And I know that because we're not really seeing blood clots after three months.
[3:36:52.460 --> 3:36:54.460]  We're seeing other problems, but not blood clots.
[3:36:54.460 --> 3:37:00.460]  Now, the antibody enhancement concern is a real concern.
[3:37:00.460 --> 3:37:03.460]  But there is a way to deal with it, I think intelligently.
[3:37:03.460 --> 3:37:11.460]  And just because someone has a bomb inside them, and that's exactly what you have if you took the shot, you've made bomb antibodies that are in you.
[3:37:11.460 --> 3:37:13.460]  But it doesn't mean that they have to detonate.
[3:37:13.460 --> 3:37:21.460]  And if you understand the triggers of the detonation, you can have strategies to avoid setting off your bombs.
[3:37:21.460 --> 3:37:26.460]  And one obvious answer is don't make any more bombs.
[3:37:26.460 --> 3:37:29.460]  In other words, don't take any more shots, don't take boosters.
[3:37:29.460 --> 3:37:31.460]  If you made a mistake once, don't do it twice.
[3:37:31.460 --> 3:37:33.460]  I mean, that's obvious.
[3:37:33.460 --> 3:37:44.460]  But besides that, if you already have those bombs in you, then you have to understand that it's another viral infection of similar, similar enough to the antibodies that you have,
[3:37:44.460 --> 3:37:51.460]  that if those antibodies recognize that virus and they come together, sets off a nuclear reaction that kills you.
[3:37:51.460 --> 3:37:55.460]  And so the only way to avoid that is not to get another viral infection.
[3:37:55.460 --> 3:37:57.460]  So you can ask me, well, how are you going to do that?
[3:37:57.460 --> 3:37:59.460]  Well, again, the answer is don't take another shot.
[3:37:59.460 --> 3:38:00.460]  It's not going to help you.
[3:38:00.460 --> 3:38:03.460]  What you really need to do is take prophylaxis of prevention.
[3:38:03.460 --> 3:38:15.460]  In other words, if I have a 10-year-old patient that got the shot, that 10-year-old patient in my mind has the same risk of dying as a 95-year-old nursing home resident.
[3:38:15.460 --> 3:38:28.460]  And so I would treat that 10-year-old in an aggressive, prophylactic way in order to prevent them from getting another viral infection of similar etiology.
[3:38:28.460 --> 3:38:36.460]  Or if they do get it, I would treat them aggressively, extremely early, not to let those antibodies destroy the person.
[3:38:36.460 --> 3:38:38.460]  We do this all the time with Strep A.
[3:38:38.460 --> 3:38:48.460]  Strep A is always treated with antibiotics because if the immune system treats Strep A, it also attacks the hearts of children causing rheumatic fever, heart disease.
[3:38:48.460 --> 3:38:54.460]  So in order to protect the hearts of children, we don't want your immune reaction to take care of it.
[3:38:54.460 --> 3:38:58.460]  We want antibiotics to take care of it in the context of Strep A.
[3:38:58.460 --> 3:39:02.460]  And the same concept comes to these viral infections.
[3:39:02.460 --> 3:39:08.460]  I do not want your immune system to trigger its pathologic antibodies and kill you.
[3:39:08.460 --> 3:39:11.460]  I rather use antiviral drugs to prevent you from getting it.
[3:39:11.460 --> 3:39:20.460]  So, I mean, I'm a layperson, but that's what I just said on there myself is if this vaccine basically creates a spike protein similar to the virus and we're worried about that,
[3:39:20.460 --> 3:39:24.460]  well, you don't want to come in contact with new viruses, that's what could trigger this.
[3:39:24.460 --> 3:39:25.460]  You don't want to be able to replicate.
[3:39:25.460 --> 3:39:38.460]  So the answer is everything that's already healthy, that's essential, vitamin D, zinc, all those type of things, sunshine, air, clean water, washing your hands, all of that would then contribute to you not detonating the bomb.
[3:39:38.460 --> 3:39:42.460]  Well, having a healthy immune system, having a good bulletproof vest is important.
[3:39:42.460 --> 3:39:51.460]  But it's also important not to get shot in the head and take proper precautions and to have the right machine gun also that if the enemy comes near you, you destroy it.
[3:39:51.460 --> 3:40:01.460]  So, it's multifaceted approach to stay alive, but the key, by the way, it's not the spike proteins that do the harm over time.
[3:40:01.460 --> 3:40:04.460]  The spike proteins will fade after three to six months.
[3:40:04.460 --> 3:40:09.460]  The concern is their antibodies produced because of the spike proteins.
[3:40:09.460 --> 3:40:16.460]  You see, those spike proteins trigger the immune response that make the antibodies that sit in you forever and do the damage.
[3:40:16.460 --> 3:40:20.460]  So the next time you come in contact with a virus or what is it then?
[3:40:20.460 --> 3:40:21.460]  That's right.
[3:40:21.460 --> 3:40:24.460]  Next time you come, let's go back to 1960s.
[3:40:24.460 --> 3:40:28.460]  We get kids RSV vaccine, they made RSV antibodies.
[3:40:28.460 --> 3:40:33.460]  Then when the kids met RSV virus in the world, they died.
[3:40:33.460 --> 3:40:36.460]  So it's the viral trigger.
[3:40:36.460 --> 3:40:41.460]  Well, here's my next question and I've got a meeting to go to at three, but let's just do the final segment.
[3:40:41.460 --> 3:40:42.460]  This is too important.
[3:40:42.460 --> 3:40:47.460]  We've got three minutes to break from other doctors I've talked to and people that have predicted what's coming next.
[3:40:47.460 --> 3:40:48.460]  And I think you said similar things.
[3:40:48.460 --> 3:40:49.460]  We don't want to put words in your mouth.
[3:40:49.460 --> 3:40:53.460]  How are they going to cover up the antibody enhancement syndrome?
[3:40:53.460 --> 3:40:55.460]  What are they going to blame that on?
[3:40:55.460 --> 3:40:57.460]  Obviously, they planned all this out.
[3:40:57.460 --> 3:41:01.460]  So thinking logically like Sherlock Holmes would do or Dr. Zalinko would do.
[3:41:01.460 --> 3:41:06.460]  How are they going to cover up this mass die off that's obviously coming and we already see a lot of death happening?
[3:41:06.460 --> 3:41:07.460]  How are they going to do that?
[3:41:07.460 --> 3:41:10.460]  They're going to blame you and me because we didn't take the vaccine.
[3:41:10.460 --> 3:41:16.460]  And they're going to say that we're the ones that are spreading the infection.
[3:41:16.460 --> 3:41:17.460]  So a few questions.
[3:41:17.460 --> 3:41:20.460]  First of all, if you have vaccinated, why are you afraid of the virus?
[3:41:20.460 --> 3:41:21.460]  You're vaccinated, right?
[3:41:21.460 --> 3:41:28.460]  So number one, number two, can you tell me why vaccinated people have higher levels of virus when we checked them than unvaccinated?
[3:41:28.460 --> 3:41:37.460]  And the answer is it's the vaccinated people themselves that are much more prone to getting infections, much more prone in spreading infections.
[3:41:37.460 --> 3:41:43.460]  And they're the source of the evolutionary pressure to make more strains and more lethal strength.
[3:41:43.460 --> 3:41:50.460]  So it's the vaccinated population that is the driving force for the upcoming death.
[3:41:50.460 --> 3:41:52.460]  Dr. I know it's premeditated.
[3:41:52.460 --> 3:41:54.460]  I read the documents of you, but it's you're right.
[3:41:54.460 --> 3:41:59.460]  It's still a gamble, not the vaccine, but a gamble doing this to us because the wheels are coming off.
[3:41:59.460 --> 3:42:02.460]  People are finding out they may have dumbed down people that don't see it.
[3:42:02.460 --> 3:42:05.460]  But anybody that's even halfway smart is going to see what's going on.
[3:42:05.460 --> 3:42:07.460]  How the hell are they going to get away with this?
[3:42:07.460 --> 3:42:09.460]  The answer is no, right?
[3:42:09.460 --> 3:42:15.460]  I hope they get away by being swung in a rope at the head.
[3:42:15.460 --> 3:42:19.460]  But I guess it just goes, we try to project intelligence onto really evil people and some do have it.
[3:42:19.460 --> 3:42:22.460]  But isn't it really like you said, it's a desire like a hunger.
[3:42:22.460 --> 3:42:26.460]  They want to do this because they're jealous of free people.
[3:42:26.460 --> 3:42:31.460]  Yeah, they somehow think that their lives will be better when there's less people in the world.
[3:42:31.460 --> 3:42:37.460]  And they have some artificial sense of power over robots and slaves.
[3:42:37.460 --> 3:42:41.460]  That's it. You've absolutely nailed it unlike any other guess we've got.
[3:42:41.460 --> 3:42:43.460]  And I'm not kissing your rear end here. The doc, it's true.
[3:42:43.460 --> 3:42:47.460]  You know what you're talking about? People can get your great product at ZStackLife.com.

[3:43:38.460 --> 3:43:42.460]  And never give up the fight.
[3:43:42.460 --> 3:43:49.460]  My business model is very, very simple.
[3:43:49.460 --> 3:44:00.460]  I want to bring you products that work really, really well at affordable prices that are competitive so that you'll shop with us.
[3:44:00.460 --> 3:44:08.460]  And so we form a relationship so we're able to stay on air and fight the globalist and have good products that make us healthy,
[3:44:08.460 --> 3:44:12.460]  make us wiser, that boost our immune system. And that's what we've done.
[3:44:12.460 --> 3:44:16.460]  Now, one area of the immune system we don't talk enough about is deep, restful sleep.
[3:44:16.460 --> 3:44:21.460]  You can look it up for yourself. The effects of deep, restful sleep on health and the immune system.
[3:44:21.460 --> 3:44:26.460]  And so with everything we're doing out there to boost our immune system with vitamin D and zinc and all of it, that's great.
[3:44:26.460 --> 3:44:30.460]  But deep, restful sleep is just as important, maybe more important.
[3:44:30.460 --> 3:44:39.460]  So, infowarstore.com now can announce 50% off on our best-selling product, down and out, that just came back in after four months being sold out.

[3:44:52.460 --> 3:45:02.460]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[3:45:02.460 --> 3:45:08.460]  The globalists are out on the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[3:45:08.460 --> 3:45:16.460]  But the good news is, we've been working and you've been working, and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[3:45:16.460 --> 3:45:22.460]  Humanity is strong, we're incredible, and if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[3:45:22.460 --> 3:45:24.460]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[3:45:24.460 --> 3:45:31.460]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[3:45:31.460 --> 3:45:40.460]  And at the same time, supporting info wars by buying high-quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation.
[3:45:40.460 --> 3:45:51.460]  Infowarsstore.com. Infowarsstore.com is incredible. A lot of our products that have been sold out because the supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies, vasobetes, and others.
[3:45:51.460 --> 3:45:55.460]  So get them today at infowarsstore.com, and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[3:45:55.460 --> 3:46:03.460]  Could you imagine a year ago walking into a bank with your face covered? Could you imagine even going into the grocery store?
[3:46:03.460 --> 3:46:09.460]  Do you think they would let you in? Do you think they would be following you in the aisles to make sure that you weren't going to be shoplifting?
[3:46:09.460 --> 3:46:19.460]  Could you imagine going up to a gas station and going inside the little mini-mart to pay for your gas with a bandana on? How far do you think that would get you?
[3:46:19.460 --> 3:46:25.460]  Could you imagine as a teacher showing up to school with a shield that looks like a space alien?
[3:46:25.460 --> 3:46:32.460]  Those things are offensive to us because it interferes with normal human interaction.
[3:46:32.460 --> 3:46:39.460]  The globalists are running a psychological warfare operation on humanity. Only waking up to the great reset in its tyranny will save us.
[3:46:39.460 --> 3:46:48.460]  And the mask is the sign of slavery. We must inform the public that it's a fraud, that it's dangerous, that it causes major medical issues, and it's dehumanizing.
[3:46:48.460 --> 3:47:06.460]  And the film COVID Land does that. Secure your copy now at covidland.com and get a free copy of the in-game with your purchase.
[3:47:06.460 --> 3:47:18.460]  You know 10 years ago I played happy country music and rock and roll and folk stuff here on air because I was a happy guy.
[3:47:18.460 --> 3:47:27.460]  We were going to beat the globalists. They never actually pulled the trigger. Now I play epic operatic music because it's the only thing fits just how much trouble we're in.
[3:47:27.460 --> 3:47:37.460]  But as Dr. Zalinko said, it's the big test of humanity. So in closing, sir, you said a lot of powerful stuff about being on a war footing and where we are.
[3:47:37.460 --> 3:47:44.460]  But in closing, how do we turn this around? How do we push this back? How do we make sure that before billions are dead, we're able to start reversing this and bring these criminals to justice?
[3:47:44.460 --> 3:47:59.460]  Well, we need like-minded generals like Joe Rogan and people that have platforms like him that could broadcast the truth. I mean, these are independent thinkers, heroes, inspirations of mine actually in many ways.
[3:47:59.460 --> 3:48:09.460]  And I really hope that they think carefully through the narrative and look through the facts and then use their beautiful platforms to inform the public.
[3:48:09.460 --> 3:48:15.460]  Because that's the key here. This is an information war. This is a narrative war. The enemies of humanity have you-
[3:48:15.460 --> 3:48:23.460]  And Dr. Zalinko, this is too important. As much as I love your dog, I want to get this out because this is powerful. I'm going to make a promo video with this.
[3:48:23.460 --> 3:48:26.460]  So what type of dog do you have? I love dogs too.
[3:48:26.460 --> 3:48:29.460]  I have a golden doodle. Should I bring him in or out and what should I do?
[3:48:29.460 --> 3:48:32.460]  Do whatever you like, but I want you to be able to restart and recap what you were just saying.
[3:48:32.460 --> 3:48:42.460]  Sure, take a minute and put the labradoodle away. He loves Daddy. We know that. Because I want to be able to start over what he was saying about Joe because Doc doesn't know it, but I was asking that question.
[3:48:42.460 --> 3:48:49.460]  Well, I guess he probably could figure it out. I'm going to do- I just told him to do a promo. So here we go. Oh my God, I love labradoodles.
[3:48:49.460 --> 3:48:56.460]  See, my French bulldog- there it is. My French bulldog died a few years ago. He was 12 and then me and my wife had been arguing about what type of dog to get.
[3:48:56.460 --> 3:49:01.460]  I think we're settling on a labradoodle. Wow, Doc, that's awesome. What's your dog's name?
[3:49:01.460 --> 3:49:03.460]  Mishka means teddy bear in Russian.
[3:49:03.460 --> 3:49:06.460]  Oh, Mishka. So cute.
[3:49:06.460 --> 3:49:09.460]  He's a good prop. So listen-
[3:49:09.460 --> 3:49:14.460]  Yeah, go ahead and start over, Doc, with what you were saying about what we need to do. That was key.
[3:49:14.460 --> 3:49:29.460]  Listen, we need generals. We need people with platforms like Joe Rogan and other people like that who are free-thinking spirits who don't buy into the false narrative and are able to kind of dig out the truth themselves.
[3:49:29.460 --> 3:49:34.460]  And they have the trust of the people. So this is the key here. This is a narrative war.
[3:49:34.460 --> 3:49:41.460]  The enemies of humanity have control over the social media. They have a head start, social media, mainstream media, but we can catch up.
[3:49:41.460 --> 3:49:45.460]  And a little truth, a little light, dispenses a lot of darkness.
[3:49:45.460 --> 3:50:04.460]  So I plead on people like Joe and Rogan and other people with platforms to wake up, join coalesce together as an army of truth speakers and say no to these animals and these despots and save as many people as we can with spreading the truth.
[3:50:04.460 --> 3:50:16.460]  The soul of humanity is at stake here. It's time to wake up and it's time to rise up. Don't be complacent. This is World War III. This is the call of our generation.
[3:50:16.460 --> 3:50:30.460]  And I promise you, at the end of your days, when Rogan is lying in his deathbed when he's 120, and he realizes that his platform was used to spread the truth to millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of people,
[3:50:30.460 --> 3:50:37.460]  that will be a good, good thing for him in his relationship with God and for all of us.
[3:50:37.460 --> 3:50:48.460]  Beautifully said, Dr. Zalinko. Thank you so much and God bless you. And we really appreciate you. Anytime you can come back on to keep chronicling things, please join us. Have a great weekend.
[3:50:48.460 --> 3:50:49.460]  God bless you. Thank you.
[3:50:49.460 --> 3:50:56.460]  God bless you. Well, that was extremely powerful and I was going to play a clip for these NBA players who are like more eloquent than I am.
[3:50:56.460 --> 3:51:03.460]  In fact, some of these NBA players are like, one of these guys is like the most eloquent person I've ever heard speak on these shots and what's happening.
[3:51:03.460 --> 3:51:13.460]  So I was going to get to that. We already played some a few days ago. There's more coming out. There's more. And I'm like, wow, these are definitely leaders we need.
[3:51:13.460 --> 3:51:20.460]  These should be senators. These should be presidents, not because they're black, but because the way they lay it out is the best I've heard.
[3:51:20.460 --> 3:51:31.460]  So we've got Owen Schreuer about to take over in the war room. I'm going to come in here tomorrow with Dr. Fleming, who's going to be in studio with us doing a whole presentation.
[3:51:31.460 --> 3:51:36.460]  He's got all the documentation on how they're killing us and how it's premeditated and where it's all going and how to stop them.
[3:51:36.460 --> 3:51:41.460]  So we're going to be shooting from like 11 to three tomorrow. I look forward to air at five or so.
[3:51:41.460 --> 3:51:53.460]  Some people get mad when the Saturday shows don't happen at five. Hey, it's a skeleton crew. We're doing it on our own then. And you know, by that, we don't have like the satellites and all the other stuff.
[3:51:53.460 --> 3:52:00.460]  And so we're going to have a human studio and it's going to be powerful and I'm going to shoot some special reports tomorrow as well.
[3:52:00.460 --> 3:52:07.460]  But I got to tell you, everything Zelenko said today was even more powerful than usual. And we need to take this information and turn it into promos.
[3:52:07.460 --> 3:52:13.460]  We need to get it out. All of you that are taking clips out of the show, you know, you are great job. The crew is doing a great job.
[3:52:13.460 --> 3:52:22.460]  And as long as I can not get over revved and over focused here, we're going to win this thing. And yes, it's going to be rough, but it's going to get rough anyway.
[3:52:22.460 --> 3:52:28.460]  So you might as well just not, you know, lay down and let them chew your guts out of their leisure, but give them one hell of a fight.
[3:52:28.460 --> 3:52:37.460]  And it's that process that's going to bring us into the future spiritually and on the third dimension for our children and their children.
[3:52:37.460 --> 3:52:46.460]  But yes, I've had to come to grips with the fact that people have asked me with the news you've seen out there about default judgments and all this stuff and like, oh, how are you taking it?
[3:52:46.460 --> 3:52:54.460]  They want to shut you down. You don't get a jury trial. They're already injected millions of people with something that's designed to slowly kill them.
[3:52:54.460 --> 3:53:00.460]  And I use the Star Trek, Rat the Con thing because that's one of the better Star Trek. I don't like my Star Trek, but I like that one.
[3:53:00.460 --> 3:53:06.460]  I like some of the old 60s movies. Those are, you know, TV shows. I like to finish stuff for comedy stuff. I love Captain Kirk, Liam Shatner.
[3:53:06.460 --> 3:53:13.460]  But Rat the Con, where Spock knows that when the bomb goes off, it's going to blow up the ship, that their engines are out.
[3:53:13.460 --> 3:53:20.460]  And so he goes down there and kills himself to save everybody. Somebody's got to go in there and do it. And I'm not like Mr. Hero doing that.
[3:53:20.460 --> 3:53:29.460]  I'm not going to watch my kids sit there and get fed on by this. I'm not going to just roll over to this and then watch all these other men sit there and do nothing while this happens.
[3:53:29.460 --> 3:53:34.460]  I mean, I always thought I would go get other men to wake up and take action. And that's happened to a certain extent.
[3:53:34.460 --> 3:53:40.460]  But then more and more, I get pushed in a leadership position, which I don't even want. But I'll tell you this, I'm not backing down.
[3:53:40.460 --> 3:53:47.460]  I'm not shutting up. In fact, I'm stronger with all these attacks and these lies and the horrible things they've done to me that I won't even tell you on air.
[3:53:47.460 --> 3:53:52.460]  But it's painful. But man, those wounds literally took me up multiple levels.
[3:53:52.460 --> 3:53:57.460]  And I got God's plan now. I've got a lot bigger eyeball on it than I used to.
[3:53:57.460 --> 3:54:02.460]  I always love God, but now I've got a lot bigger understanding of it and I just want to know more.
[3:54:02.460 --> 3:54:15.460]  But I also am fleshly. I don't like pain and I don't like bad things happening and I don't like physical things happening and I don't like, you know, the horrible persecution that goes on against my family and things.
[3:54:15.460 --> 3:54:23.460]  But that's OK because somebody's got to stand up against these people. And I know you as an audience of activists, you burman that same desire for justice as I do.
[3:54:23.460 --> 3:54:35.460]  And I love you and I want to thank you for keeping us in attack formation, for keeping us on the attack against these bullies and this scum and that they fear us and they hate us and they don't know what to do because we love God.
[3:54:35.460 --> 3:54:40.460]  So I don't attack these people because I hate them. I fight them because I love my family.
[3:54:40.460 --> 3:54:46.460]  You know, the paraphrase, the famous philosopher that said, we don't fight for the evil in front of us. We don't fight because we hate it.
[3:54:46.460 --> 3:54:52.460]  We fight because those of us that understand it know that we have to fight for our children and others behind us.
[3:54:52.460 --> 3:54:56.460]  So we don't fight because of who we hate in front of us. We fight for those we love behind us.
[3:54:56.460 --> 3:55:02.460]  And that's what it comes down to. So go to infowarstore.com. Get a t-shirt. Get a book. Get a film.
[3:55:02.460 --> 3:55:10.460]  Get our great sleep aid that's now back in stock, 50% off, down and out, which is even stronger than knockout, but it's in stock too, 50% off.
[3:55:10.460 --> 3:55:17.460]  And we've got all these other great products like the greens capsules from sprouts that are so good for your body, so many vitamins and minerals, but also clean out your guts.
[3:55:17.460 --> 3:55:24.460]  It's going to sell out in a couple of days. It's still 50% off and that's what allows our operation to stay on air.
[3:55:24.460 --> 3:55:34.460]  But the most important thing is to continue to pray for the broadcast and to spread the word about the broadcast because that's the key currency I'm after is to reach new people and to reach out to new folks.
[3:55:34.460 --> 3:55:43.460]  And you've changed the world doing it. You are the hardcore brigades of men, women and children, every race, color and creed or one race with red blood that love God fighting these monsters.
[3:55:43.460 --> 3:55:51.460]  So we're going to end the transmission and play this Joe Rogan piece with the swearing cut out. It's not as powerful, but that's posted on his Instagram.
[3:55:51.460 --> 3:55:56.460]  You want to see it, share it. And this is the American way. This is what it's all about.
[3:55:56.460 --> 3:56:05.460]  And we've got Joe to come almost completely into the light now and others are as well because they see how real this is and they have the courage to fight.
[3:56:05.460 --> 3:56:13.460]  And so it's on. So thank you all for what you've done. You've changed the world and the fight against tyranny has just begun. Here's the Joe Rogan piece.
[3:56:13.460 --> 3:56:29.460]  As soon as you give politicians power, any kind of power that didn't exist previously, if they can figure out a way to force you into carrying something that lets you enter businesses or lets you do this or lets businesses open historically,
[3:56:29.460 --> 3:56:34.460]  they are not going to give that power up. They find new reasons to use all through God.
[3:56:34.460 --> 3:56:42.460]  We have to protect those freedoms at all costs, whether you agree with people's choices or not, because it is the foundation that this country was founded on.
[3:56:42.460 --> 3:56:52.460]  Freedom. This idea of freedom, there's so many people that think it's frivolous, it's not important, it's not the main thing that we should be focused on.
[3:56:52.460 --> 3:57:11.460]  But it is the literal structure that allows this country to be so amazing. Every single country that's ever existed other than the United States, up until 1776, every fucking country that has ever existed was run by the dictators, all of them.
[3:57:11.460 --> 3:57:17.460]  This is the first experiment in self-government that actually worked and it created the greatest superpower the world's ever known.
[3:57:17.460 --> 3:57:25.460]  It created the greatest cultural machine, the greatest machine of art and creativity and innovation right in here.
[3:57:25.460 --> 3:57:36.460]  And how did it do that? It did it through freedom. And as soon as you see something, anything that comes along and inhibits your freedom, you should be very cautious of that thing.
[3:57:36.460 --> 3:57:44.460]  You should be very suspicious because anything that comes along that can inhibit your freedom is, by definition, anti-American.
