[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:21.000]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:21.000 --> 00:34.880]  Well, I will assure you, my friends, this is going to be a Tuesday edition of the
[00:34.880 --> 00:41.040]  worldwide broadcast on this 26th day of March 2013 that you will not want to miss. A couple
[00:41.040 --> 00:48.280]  days ago, Jim Carrey, the comedian and Hollywood star, he's a star and you're not. He's got
[00:48.280 --> 00:54.640]  bodyguards and you don't. And so does Michael Moore, but that's okay. He put out a video
[00:54.640 --> 00:59.440]  that only broke in the press yesterday. That's when I saw it and when I noticed it was in
[00:59.440 --> 01:09.640]  a lot of newspapers, lauding him in a very, very nasty piece demonizing a dead man, Charlton
[01:09.640 --> 01:18.240]  Heston. And in the attitude of this, we see the same attitude of Dianne Feinstein and
[01:18.240 --> 01:23.880]  Al Gore and all the other anti-gunners like Michael Moore.
[01:23.880 --> 01:32.380]  In it, we see the incredible nastiness where they say it's his fault people die, period,
[01:32.380 --> 01:36.560]  and that he's not going to heaven and that he's basically a murderer. I have the text
[01:36.560 --> 01:42.180]  of it right here. We're not going to play it. It's got profanity in it, but the video
[01:42.180 --> 01:50.640]  is up on infowars.com. But what's bad is I've never been a huge Jim Carrey fan, but he has
[01:50.640 --> 01:56.520]  had some decent roles and I'm getting to where I can't hardly go see movies and I won't watch
[01:56.520 --> 02:01.820]  movies that have people in them that it's not that they disagree with me.
[02:01.820 --> 02:06.240]  If somebody was really fooled and said, hey, I don't think the citizens should have guns
[02:06.240 --> 02:09.200]  like Jim Hightower, who was in studio with me last week on The Nightly News, we're going
[02:09.200 --> 02:14.560]  to play a clip of that today, former Texas agriculture commissioner and kind of an organic
[02:14.560 --> 02:19.280]  activist who I respect on that front. He calmly explained why he doesn't think we need semi-autos
[02:19.280 --> 02:22.760]  and then had to admit the government's arming to the teeth, so why should we give our guns
[02:22.760 --> 02:23.760]  up?
[02:23.760 --> 02:29.820]  I mean, he had a real discussion with me. But when you start making fun of people that
[02:29.820 --> 02:35.280]  were amazing human beings like Charlton Heston, I got a chance to interview Charlton Heston
[02:35.280 --> 02:39.020]  a couple times. I mentioned it a few years ago, people didn't believe it, so we could
[02:39.020 --> 02:46.120]  barely find one of the interviews. One of them is lost. There's a one 8-bit horrible
[02:46.120 --> 02:51.000]  Internet recording that's now been put up to YouTube.
[02:51.000 --> 02:56.140]  And I can't find another interview I did with him. And he gave me his home phone number
[02:56.140 --> 02:59.500]  after I had him on the first time and said, if you ever need to talk strategy about the
[02:59.500 --> 03:03.680]  Second Amendment liberty, you can call me. And I said, I can call you? And he goes, yeah,
[03:03.680 --> 03:10.920]  I'm a regular guy. And I called up and I didn't call him for about a year.
[03:10.920 --> 03:13.560]  It was just weird having Charlton Heston's phone number. I don't call really any of the
[03:13.560 --> 03:18.880]  famous people I know for whatever reason. I just, they've got their life, I've got mine.
[03:18.880 --> 03:23.940]  And I called a few times, he didn't answer. I called back one day, he answered, hi, this
[03:23.940 --> 03:29.400]  is Chuck. And I was sitting there talking. I've had Ted Nugent's cell phone number for
[03:29.400 --> 03:33.880]  a while, never called it. I called it this morning, driving into work about an hour ago.
[03:33.880 --> 03:38.080]  And he goes, what are you calling about what Kerry said about Heston? And I'm all over
[03:38.080 --> 03:39.080]  it.
[03:39.080 --> 03:44.800]  And I've never heard him so focused and so angry, focused anger. And he said, you bet
[03:44.800 --> 03:50.720]  I'm coming on your show. I gotta do Dennis Miller, and he's doing it right now. And then
[03:50.720 --> 03:58.260]  he's gonna come on at noon. And he said, listen, this is another miscalculation. His nastiness
[03:58.260 --> 04:01.720]  is gonna backfire on them just like Piers Morgan. And of course, he agrees that the
[04:01.720 --> 04:06.720]  Piers Morgan thing was a death star exploding level event for the globalist.
[04:06.720 --> 04:10.760]  And I'm not just patting myself on the back. I didn't realize it till a few days after
[04:10.760 --> 04:15.220]  just how effective it was. I'm my own biggest critic and I was like, I think it was good
[04:15.220 --> 04:19.880]  to get in his face. They tried to spin it so neocons would say, this is terrible. Standing
[04:19.880 --> 04:23.880]  up and getting aggressive is the wrong way to go. Why, it's almost like Paul Revere who
[04:23.880 --> 04:28.320]  rode around screaming in the night saying, kill people. I'm just yelling at somebody
[04:28.320 --> 04:31.080]  a little bit and saying, how dare you try to disarm us?
[04:31.080 --> 04:36.000]  How dare I talk like that? I mean, imagine that's not even one tenth as bad as that criminal
[04:36.000 --> 04:42.920]  Paul Revere. So it totally backfired on them. But we're gonna go over this and we're gonna
[04:42.920 --> 04:47.720]  go over all the geopolitical news, economic news. It's all crazy, but the tyranny is on,
[04:47.720 --> 04:52.280]  folks. And if they can get our guns, they're going to get everything. But we're gonna be
[04:52.280 --> 04:56.760]  breaking this down today and more and your phone calls stay with us Ted Nugent coming
[04:56.760 --> 05:00.360]  up.

[08:14.300 --> 08:22.560]  Make no mistake, my friends, the battle for human liberty is taking place right now. And
[08:22.560 --> 08:27.440]  the heart of that fight is here in the United States because the United States will either
[08:27.440 --> 08:32.400]  be an engine for the globalists to loot and pillage the world, or it will once again become
[08:32.400 --> 08:35.920]  an engine of innovation and liberty.
[08:35.920 --> 08:47.320]  And that shining fortress on the hill. Ladies and gentlemen, something snapped in me last
[08:47.320 --> 08:52.440]  night when I saw a video that came out a few days ago, but only got attention in the news
[08:52.440 --> 09:05.520]  yesterday by the somewhat washed up Canadian anti individualist Jim Carrey. I saw a video
[09:05.520 --> 09:14.160]  of him celebrating Charlton Heston's death and defaming him, defaming a dead man who
[09:14.160 --> 09:19.160]  I personally had a chance to interview several times and who I had a chance to talk to off
[09:19.160 --> 09:26.680]  air once. And I've never told that story because that was private.
[09:26.680 --> 09:32.960]  I will talk a little bit about it today. And I had a chance to talk to Ted Nugent this
[09:32.960 --> 09:42.600]  morning who you could tell was very upset because he was very close friends with Charlton
[09:42.600 --> 10:01.160]  Heston. When you see people that are clearly authoritarians dancing on Patriots graves,
[10:01.160 --> 10:07.800]  it's disgusting. Charlton Heston as he got older became even more of a gentleman and
[10:07.800 --> 10:09.560]  more of a real person.
[10:09.560 --> 10:13.440]  I don't even admire him for his great acting ability and all of his wonderful films that
[10:13.440 --> 10:21.140]  I've enjoyed throughout my life, like Ben Hur, the Ten Commandments. The list is just
[10:21.140 --> 10:31.240]  countless the films he did with great directors like Orson Welles, Soylent Green. I admired
[10:31.240 --> 10:42.200]  him because I, working in talk radio and fighting for the Second Amendment, got to know a lot
[10:42.200 --> 10:44.680]  of people that really knew Charlton Heston well.
[10:44.680 --> 10:53.840]  And he was really a super down to earth, super manly, classy guy in amongst a bunch of spoiled,
[10:53.840 --> 11:03.640]  rotten, lazy, pampered Hollywood people. And the fact that I had his home phone number
[11:03.640 --> 11:07.400]  and he said, if you ever want to talk about strategy or anything happening, give me a
[11:07.400 --> 11:08.400]  call.
[11:08.400 --> 11:11.480]  So about a year after I had his number and he'd been on a few times, I called him a few
[11:11.480 --> 11:15.600]  times and he didn't answer because nobody answered. It was just an office phone. And
[11:15.600 --> 11:21.440]  one day he said, well, if I can ever pick up, I will. And he picked up the phone and
[11:21.440 --> 11:26.080]  I talked to him, I don't know, 20, 30 minutes.
[11:26.080 --> 11:35.880]  And I didn't even tell my wife about it. And he talked about one of my films he'd seen
[11:35.880 --> 11:41.440]  and about how it was up to younger people like myself to carry on the fight. And the
[11:41.440 --> 11:50.140]  point was he was really taking time out to give me energy. He really cared. He sat there
[11:50.140 --> 11:54.140]  talking to more than 50 people most weeks, working hard.
[11:54.140 --> 11:59.720]  And I know it made his wife so angry, that's come out in the press, that he really had
[11:59.720 --> 12:06.400]  an instinct. And you watch his eyes in that famous NRA speech. We all see hindsight's
[12:06.400 --> 12:11.880]  20, 20. Heston obviously made mistakes in political endorsements and things, but he
[12:11.880 --> 12:12.880]  was a trailblazer.
[12:12.880 --> 12:17.540]  He was somebody who marched with Martin Luther King when it wasn't popular. He was somebody
[12:17.540 --> 12:24.160]  that went and was part of civil rights sit-ins in Oklahoma and Alabama, when people were
[12:24.160 --> 12:30.200]  getting killed. He didn't come to the whole thing late. As Mark Twain said in the beginning,
[12:30.200 --> 12:33.200]  a patriot is a scarce man hated and feared and scorned.
[12:33.200 --> 12:38.160]  But in time when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to
[12:38.160 --> 12:44.720]  be a patriot. And then it was like a year or two after I talked to him, cuz I had his
[12:44.720 --> 12:51.980]  number, I didn't wanna bug him. I didn't wanna bother him. Then his wife rolls him out, obviously
[12:51.980 --> 12:56.060]  on medication to say, well, I probably went a little too far sometime and then you never
[12:56.060 --> 12:58.060]  saw him again.
[12:58.060 --> 13:04.200]  They put him on 20, 20. And I knew people that have talked to him right up to the time
[13:04.200 --> 13:08.880]  that he just suddenly, clearly on medication, didn't know who he was. Kinda like they did
[13:08.880 --> 13:17.660]  to Ronald Reagan, shut him up. And to just know that this was a guy who, from the time
[13:17.660 --> 13:22.120]  that he was a young man in Illinois and then living in Michigan in places, hunted and fished,
[13:22.120 --> 13:24.800]  and was somebody who really loved freedom.
[13:24.800 --> 13:29.520]  And was a civil rights activist, not just for the Second Amendment, but for free speech.
[13:29.520 --> 13:37.760]  I heard him once on a local ad endorsing a state rep who was, what was his name, Green,
[13:37.760 --> 13:44.440]  who was fighting for vitamin and mineral rights. And then I heard Heston later on the radio
[13:44.440 --> 13:51.760]  locally defending supplements. I mean, he just defended freedom. And then to watch some
[13:51.760 --> 13:59.600]  sack of pus like Jim Carrey gleefully trash him up one side and down the other.
[13:59.600 --> 14:04.540]  It didn't get to me and hurt me in the way they thought, how low they were, how pathetic
[14:04.540 --> 14:09.440]  and how weak they were. And to watch all the bad actors running around and the, quote,
[14:09.440 --> 14:13.680]  cute girls. And then they laugh at Heston at the end and say, it's your fault all the
[14:13.680 --> 14:17.580]  kids died. And you're not going to heaven cuz you're a gun owner.
[14:17.580 --> 14:24.580]  And then they all laugh at him thinking that people watching that collectively, people
[14:24.580 --> 14:33.040]  watching that collectively, are supposed to then feel bad about guns and be ashamed. And
[14:33.040 --> 14:38.080]  it was so shoddy and you know what made me feel bad? Because Jim Carrey is such a bad
[14:38.080 --> 14:43.720]  actor making a few funny faces that they're so weak and Hollywood's so weak and the globalists
[14:43.720 --> 14:45.000]  really are weak.
[14:45.000 --> 14:50.120]  And so what does it say about us that we let them dominate us and we let them control us
[14:50.120 --> 14:54.540]  and we let them sit there and walk all over somebody? Let me tell you something, I've
[14:54.540 --> 15:00.120]  got stacks of interview requests in there every day and I can't physically do them.
[15:00.120 --> 15:06.840]  Okay, I am 39 years old and have a lot of stamina, ladies and gentlemen. And it is torture
[15:06.840 --> 15:11.640]  sometimes in the nightly news, but I'm so angry at the tyrants, I roll up and do it.
[15:11.640 --> 15:16.000]  I was up here till like 730 last night shooting the special reports we're gonna air this week.
[15:16.000 --> 15:22.480]  My shoulder was aching from an old football injury and I had a headache and I hadn't eaten
[15:22.480 --> 15:25.320]  and but I still just willed it.
[15:25.320 --> 15:31.640]  And I'm not saying I'm tough, 39 years old folks having to fight, having to fight to
[15:31.640 --> 15:35.800]  get the info out and feeling guilty every night when I drive home that I haven't done
[15:35.800 --> 15:41.320]  enough to defend my family and I'm weak and I'm dominated by scum. And that's exactly
[15:41.320 --> 15:51.000]  how Charlton Heston felt, almost 80 years old, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:51.000 --> 15:56.640]  On the phone and on airplanes and giving speeches everywhere to defend freedom because he had
[15:56.640 --> 16:01.480]  that instinct and I hadn't seen his NRA speech in years. And I watched that last night and
[16:01.480 --> 16:07.200]  I got tears in my eyes when he talks about how it's the patriot that smells the tyranny
[16:07.200 --> 16:11.920]  and rises up against it and what all of our ancestors did to stand up against evil.
[16:11.920 --> 16:18.200]  To have flocks of anti-liberty foreigners from countries that are subjects to the Queen
[16:18.200 --> 16:22.820]  of England that we fought against, Canadians and Brits and others who are great people
[16:22.820 --> 16:26.960]  on average, but their political instincts are that of slaves. They were raised under
[16:26.960 --> 16:34.000]  it. To come here and lecture us and to tell our dead hero that he's a piece of crap that
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.840]  didn't go into heaven and that the dead kids are his fault.
[16:37.840 --> 16:44.320]  I take that very, very, very personal. They'll love to make fun of me when I'm dead or you're
[16:44.320 --> 16:48.200]  dead. These people have set up reeducation centers. It says that in the army manual.
[16:48.200 --> 16:52.040]  These people have plans to take our guns. They have plans to use the police against
[16:52.040 --> 16:57.440]  us and it's time to rise up politically and get super aggressive. I wish I would have
[16:57.440 --> 17:00.320]  been more aggressive with Piers Morgan.
[17:00.320 --> 17:05.560]  It's time to realize just how evil these people are. Sure, I'm sure Jim Carrey's obviously
[17:05.560 --> 17:08.840]  a mentally ill. I've watched film footage of him last night doing some research when
[17:08.840 --> 17:12.320]  he's just out in public and stuff and doesn't even know he's being filmed. He's obviously
[17:12.320 --> 17:18.600]  autistic or something. I feel sorry for him, okay? He's just a circus freak.
[17:18.600 --> 17:24.300]  But the people that rolled him out there, they are our mortal enemies. Folks, they're
[17:24.300 --> 17:29.920]  not just taking the Second Amendment. They're taking everything right now. They're shutting
[17:29.920 --> 17:35.520]  down our energy. They're dumbing our kids down. They're shooting us up with deadly vaccines.
[17:35.520 --> 17:40.720]  They are arming Al-Qaeda. Look at this, Obama, post Assad Syria of Islamist extremism is
[17:40.720 --> 17:46.700]  a nightmare scenario saying we'll have to invade when they put Al-Qaeda in, arm them,
[17:46.700 --> 17:50.920]  and then we've got to have troops go die to take it over, to put in some Al-Qaeda light.
[17:50.920 --> 17:59.820]  I mean, this is insane. This is crazy. There's the London Guardian. I mean, I declare that
[17:59.820 --> 18:05.720]  I'm gonna live in reality. We have become so accustomed to living under oppression.
[18:05.720 --> 18:10.880]  We have become so accustomed to all of this. And just to know how anti-individual these
[18:10.880 --> 18:15.800]  status worshipers are, like Jim Carrey and the rest of them. Cuz you know the globalists
[18:15.800 --> 18:19.240]  are just hardcore criminals with their own bodyguards and their own guns and they have
[18:19.240 --> 18:20.280]  a will to dominate.
[18:20.280 --> 18:25.060]  I get it. I don't like it, but I respect it. And I know that's an enemy who's conscious.
[18:25.060 --> 18:31.880]  But the throngs of the mindless, gibbering followers that think literally are scared
[18:31.880 --> 18:36.920]  of defending themselves, scared of being a human, scared of being a mammal. All mammals
[18:36.920 --> 18:41.440]  protect themselves and fight back. You can grab a field mouse that's in your glove compartment
[18:41.440 --> 18:42.440]  out in the country.
[18:42.440 --> 18:45.400]  Sometimes they get in your car and you're trying to get them out nicely and they'll
[18:45.400 --> 18:49.840]  kick at you and snap at you. And I've had a field mouse bite me trying to get it out
[18:49.840 --> 18:54.000]  of a farm truck I was working on when I was a kid. I was like 13 years old out driving
[18:54.000 --> 19:00.440]  a farm truck out to a shredder. The point is, is that field mouse will fight back. I
[19:00.440 --> 19:07.400]  can't. Are we men? Are we mice? Hell, we're not even mice.
[19:07.400 --> 19:14.160]  And just what have we become, my sweetest friend? Everything and everyone I love goes
[19:14.160 --> 19:19.940]  away in the end. And then I've got to sit there and I've got to watch this piece of
[19:19.940 --> 19:25.920]  garbage squat on top of the grave of Charlton Heston and all of us. They hate him because
[19:25.920 --> 19:30.720]  he was real. He was honorable. And he got tears in his eyes when he talked about liberty.
[19:30.720 --> 19:36.080]  And he quoted Thomas Jefferson talking about the farmers, the people of the earth, the
[19:36.080 --> 19:42.160]  people that live and work. You can't really live and work in the soil and build your own
[19:42.160 --> 19:48.840]  system and not be pro-gun. Just as you're pro-liberty, just as you're pro-common sense,
[19:48.840 --> 19:56.040]  we must rediscover common sense, the spirit of common sense. We must pray for redemption.
[19:56.040 --> 20:00.160]  We must seek God's face and repent. We're going to come back with a desecration of Charlton
[20:00.160 --> 20:01.160]  Heston.
[20:01.160 --> 20:05.600]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial
[20:05.600 --> 20:10.680]  law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies. As a result, millions
[20:10.680 --> 20:15.840]  are stockpiling food, gold and weapons. But how will these items help if you or one of
[20:15.840 --> 20:21.040]  your loved ones becomes ill? Supernatural Silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you

[24:25.020 --> 24:37.220]  And he goes on, that's Jim Carrey saying that the kids are dead because of Charlton
[24:37.220 --> 24:41.880]  Heston, that the coyotes are killing people in Mexico because of Charlton Heston. I mean
[24:41.880 --> 24:46.280]  it goes on for like five minutes, just blaming everything in the world on him and saying
[24:46.280 --> 24:53.280]  he's not going to heaven, that he will basically go to hell. And it's just totally nasty.
[24:53.280 --> 24:58.320]  And then Carrey put out tweets calling gun owners scum, we're guilty for dead kids. What
[24:58.320 --> 25:03.940]  about government killing 260 plus million people in the 20th century alone and tens
[25:03.940 --> 25:09.640]  of millions already this century? I mean you're not upset about government having guns. Do
[25:09.640 --> 25:15.320]  you actually sit there and call 911 if somebody's trying to break in your gated community? No,
[25:15.320 --> 25:21.700]  you don't. You have bodyguards. I looked it up. You have firearms, Mr. Carrey. You were
[25:21.700 --> 25:29.320]  out here blaming us for death when crime rate has dropped 49% since 1991, FBI's own statistics.
[25:29.320 --> 25:34.020]  Hard numbers, violent crime, violent criminals are scared. And your spirit is with the criminals
[25:34.020 --> 25:38.660]  and the globalist are the master criminals. And they, when a robber comes into a bank,
[25:38.660 --> 25:44.060]  they say hands up and they tell the off duty cop, lower your gun, put it on the ground.
[25:44.060 --> 25:48.700]  And that's the guy they put in handcuffs or tie up. It's the same thing. The globalist
[25:48.700 --> 25:52.060]  are hands up. They've got guns. They're buying guns. They're buying tanks. They're buying
[25:52.060 --> 25:55.540]  armored vehicles and they're pointing guns at us saying hands up. Now listen to just
[25:55.540 --> 26:02.180]  part of Charlton Heston's speech he gave back at the NRA more than a decade ago. This famous
[26:02.180 --> 26:07.560]  speech where he said from my cold dead hand, but listen to the intro of it, where he talks
[26:07.560 --> 26:12.860]  about the people that first sense the tyranny and you can see the electricity in his eyes.
[26:12.860 --> 26:17.280]  Even though he's old, he animates and that's why he was a great actor because it was passion.
[26:17.280 --> 26:23.560]  It was real. He animates and again, we are then one with Charlton Heston and every other
[26:23.560 --> 26:27.860]  patriot that came before him right back to George Washington and patriots before them
[26:27.860 --> 26:30.500]  who did not like tyrants and who had courage.
[26:30.500 --> 26:34.900]  I mean, if you don't have the basic instinct to want to be free, if you don't have the
[26:34.900 --> 26:39.680]  basic instinct to know that tyranny is taking over, then you have no future. Look at how
[26:39.680 --> 26:44.500]  weak we become. Look at how jellyfish and then those of us that are still men, those
[26:44.500 --> 26:49.700]  of us that are still women, still human, still have an instinct to be self-sufficient.
[26:49.700 --> 26:55.780]  We are guilty for what your Prozac heads do and your staged events. Let's go to Charlton
[26:55.780 --> 27:01.280]  Heston from the grave. He lives on. Charlton Heston lives and I know you hate it, tyrants.
[27:01.280 --> 27:02.280]  Here it is.
[27:02.280 --> 27:09.820]  When freedom shivers in the cold shadow of true peril, it's always the patriots who first
[27:09.820 --> 27:18.460]  hear the call. That's why those five words issue an irresistible call to us all. And
[27:18.460 --> 27:27.460]  we must. So as we set out this year to defeat the divisive forces that would take freedom
[27:27.460 --> 27:35.180]  away, I want to say those fighting words for everyone within the sound of my voice to hear
[27:35.180 --> 27:41.140]  and to heed from my cold, dead hands.
[27:41.140 --> 27:51.340]  When we come back, I'm going to play a larger clip of that. It was a longer speech. Again,
[27:51.340 --> 28:03.860]  ladies and gentlemen, this system is fundamentally, fundamentally erasing every basic liberty.
[28:03.860 --> 28:14.840]  It is always the common people that wake up and turn back the tide of total authoritarianism.
[28:14.840 --> 28:19.540]  But in most countries that hasn't happened. So there's no productivity, there's no liberty,
[28:19.540 --> 28:20.540]  there's no due process.
[28:20.540 --> 28:25.820]  So everything crumbles and falls apart because the instinct of tyrants is to finally not
[28:25.820 --> 28:33.740]  let anyone even produce. Because then that makes you self-sufficient and basically uppity.
[28:33.740 --> 28:46.460]  We are fighting a total agenda 21 takeover system worldwide. We are fighting abject social
[28:46.460 --> 28:52.540]  engineering. And we're facing authoritarians that cloak themselves in the rubric of liberal
[28:52.540 --> 28:57.400]  or humanitarian where they tell you they have the high ground and you're bad unless you
[28:57.400 --> 28:58.400]  do what they say.
[28:58.400 --> 29:05.620]  Well, I refuse your mantle of guilt. And again, it doesn't mean we go follow the fake republicanoid
[29:05.620 --> 29:12.340]  conservative rhinos either. That's how the globalists took over is they have that as
[29:12.340 --> 29:17.640]  the stand in so that they can make it look like there's a full spectrum of choice.
[29:17.640 --> 29:28.380]  Carol Quigley wrote about that in his Georgetown writings and in Tragedy and Hope. How they
[29:28.380 --> 29:32.700]  wanted it to look like there was choice but there wasn't. And when you look at the vitriol,
[29:32.700 --> 29:37.700]  the hatred, I mean Michael Moore comes out and says evil whites want guns, evil whites
[29:37.700 --> 29:39.980]  that live in the country and make $60,000 a year.
[29:39.980 --> 29:45.420]  And that sounds so crazy, but it shows the hatred they have for anybody who's self-sufficient
[29:45.420 --> 29:48.780]  and how they want to create division. We'll be right back. Stay with us with the full
[29:48.780 --> 29:49.780]  testing clip.
[29:49.780 --> 30:01.220]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[31:10.540 --> 31:15.700]  are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons. But how will these items help if you or one of

[32:59.340 --> 33:09.340]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:09.340 --> 33:22.780]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., we're here. Ted Nugent, good friend of Charlton
[33:22.780 --> 33:32.440]  Heston, is going to be joining us at the start of the next hour. If they can stick their
[33:32.440 --> 33:37.380]  hands down our pants at the TSA, if they can take your property without due process, if
[33:37.380 --> 33:42.260]  they can secretly arrest Americans and disappear us, if they can openly say they're spying
[33:42.260 --> 33:44.100]  on us and reading all of our bank records.
[33:44.100 --> 33:47.660]  Remember just six, seven years ago, that was a conspiracy theory. Of course, it came out
[33:47.660 --> 33:53.300]  they were. If they can throw the gauntlet down and have us accept it, and then openly
[33:53.300 --> 33:57.960]  have the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL demonize anyone that talks about the billions
[33:57.960 --> 34:02.300]  of bullets, the thousands of armored vehicles, hundreds of thousands of new rounds being
[34:02.300 --> 34:05.540]  bought a week, the militarization of police.
[34:05.540 --> 34:11.380]  This is the takeover and they're trying to use psych warfare like Tokyo Rose broadcasting
[34:11.380 --> 34:18.560]  to the Pacific Fleet and Admiral Nimitz saying, you've been defeated, America will be invaded.
[34:18.560 --> 34:24.060]  Your ships are being sunk. Even as Japan was burning and it had atomic bombs dropped on
[34:24.060 --> 34:28.480]  it, Tokyo Rose was broadcasting saying America had been defeated.
[34:28.480 --> 34:32.220]  Just like Baghdad Bob saying, there are no Americans in Iraq, we have kicked them out
[34:32.220 --> 34:36.800]  of the country. You see jets flying behind him and bombs going off. Well, it's the same
[34:36.800 --> 34:41.240]  type of propaganda to go, there are no bullets, there are no checkpoints, there is no tyranny,
[34:41.240 --> 34:42.760]  there is no fast and furious.
[34:42.760 --> 34:46.940]  We didn't give billions to fake energy companies. We didn't do anything wrong. We wanna get
[34:46.940 --> 34:50.860]  America moving while they shut down the power plants, while they pass regulations so you
[34:50.860 --> 34:55.180]  can't have any business here, shipping it all to China. The globalist are authoritarians
[34:55.180 --> 35:00.700]  who hate Americans so much, their instinct is to hate liberty, that they're moving everything
[35:00.700 --> 35:06.440]  to authoritarian China, where they have suicide nets, forced abortions, mobile execution vans.
[35:06.440 --> 35:14.620]  And you will never, you will never hear a Jim Carrey or anybody else criticize the communist
[35:14.620 --> 35:20.160]  Chinese that have killed more than 100 million of their own people, close to 80 million some
[35:20.160 --> 35:28.900]  estimates just under Mao's reign, 100 million people, not counting 300 million abortions.
[35:28.900 --> 35:33.060]  Not counting over 100 million babies killed, they don't even count babies as humans up
[35:33.060 --> 35:38.660]  to about age one, the government. Notice the Journal of Bioethics has come out and said,
[35:38.660 --> 35:42.820]  let's kill kids up to age three, now the death panels are admitted, remember those didn't
[35:42.820 --> 35:43.820]  exist.
[35:43.820 --> 35:51.980]  These are authoritarians. And the Republican Party went along and helped write Obamacare
[35:51.980 --> 35:56.140]  because it's written by the same big equity groups that are taking over energy systems
[35:56.140 --> 36:01.620]  and shutting off their competition. And they're making double the profits this year alone,
[36:01.620 --> 36:06.820]  they're set to make off of Obamacare, ripping you off and doubling the price and making
[36:06.820 --> 36:08.380]  you buy it.
[36:08.380 --> 36:15.540]  Okay, we're in deep trouble and just like Bush could engage in tyranny, and Republicans
[36:15.540 --> 36:22.740]  wouldn't see any of it because he was their guy, you so called Democrats are absolutely
[36:22.740 --> 36:28.660]  useful idiots, you are dupes and you are fools. Now, here is another segment of Charlton Heston's
[36:28.660 --> 36:36.780]  speech, where he is really speaking to the essence of the instinct to recognize tyranny.
[36:36.780 --> 36:41.920]  And I mean, it's blaring now, I heard it when it was like a 100 piece band down the road,
[36:41.920 --> 36:48.020]  but you could hear it, hear the beat, hear the words, very, very clear.
[36:48.020 --> 36:53.640]  You could hear the marching band and the sergeant leading them up two, up two, three, four,
[36:53.640 --> 36:59.820]  you could hear the whole thing. Now the 100 piece band is in the living room, beating
[36:59.820 --> 37:04.620]  the drums as loud as they can, you can't hear anything, it's so loud.
[37:04.620 --> 37:10.860]  And people are saying, if you say you hear a sound of tyranny, it doesn't exist. And
[37:10.860 --> 37:15.180]  this is what happens by successive approximation, incrementalism and compartmentalization and
[37:15.180 --> 37:20.700]  learned helplessness and mass Stockholm syndrome and normalcy bias, look all those things up.
[37:20.700 --> 37:26.980]  And the Stanford research prison experiment test, they are artificially by increments,
[37:26.980 --> 37:28.420]  people denied things were happening.
[37:28.420 --> 37:32.900]  They denied things were going on, the media, the authorities, the government said, then
[37:32.900 --> 37:37.540]  none of that exist. Well, really a black helicopter crash in our town, they blew up a building,
[37:37.540 --> 37:41.060]  they arrested citizens that videotaped it, it's in my local paper. No, you didn't see
[37:41.060 --> 37:45.660]  that. Well, yeah, yeah, I have the local paper. No, you didn't. That's national TV. No, you
[37:45.660 --> 37:46.660]  didn't.
[37:46.660 --> 37:51.260]  Ron Paul, CNN said, is making up a NAFTA superhighway trans Texas corridor that was in billboards
[37:51.260 --> 37:56.500]  and signs, cover of Newsweek. But when people turned against it, they came out and said
[37:56.500 --> 38:02.580]  doesn't exist. I've played the clip where CNN says Ron Paul is insane, this is like
[38:02.580 --> 38:08.420]  five years ago during that campaign, there is no trans Texas corridor.
[38:08.420 --> 38:12.980]  Americans were like, the billboards are everywhere, they're building part of it right now from
[38:12.980 --> 38:17.580]  Mexico up to Austin, it's gonna go all the way to Canada. You told us it was a great
[38:17.580 --> 38:21.860]  idea, they're like didn't exist. And a lot of the public went okay, it didn't exist.
[38:21.860 --> 38:28.500]  Because to win is to buy the lie, to win is to be a schmuck, to win is to be a sucker,
[38:28.500 --> 38:35.060]  to win is to be a fool, to win is to buy into illusion and delusion. Well, no, that's the
[38:35.060 --> 38:41.020]  illusion. That is not to win, being some cult member where Tholes of Doom says to one of
[38:41.020 --> 38:47.180]  the cult members up 500 feet on a ledge, come to me, come to me my child, fly, fly.
[38:47.180 --> 38:51.580]  And then she jumps off and falls and smashes through the floor. That's what you people
[38:51.580 --> 38:56.280]  are like. And the New World Order saying we come in peace, I am your friend, there is
[38:56.280 --> 39:03.160]  no tyranny, come to me my child, come to me. I'm like no, you're a snake, like your father,
[39:03.160 --> 39:09.140]  you're the father of lies. I know what you are, I see you, I understand you. I am crazed
[39:09.140 --> 39:11.300]  with the animating force of liberty.
[39:11.300 --> 39:18.900]  You are animated with darkness and I see you, I know what you are. And it's time to get
[39:18.900 --> 39:24.100]  aggressive in the face of the tyrants. People probably noticed I've gotten more intense
[39:24.100 --> 39:29.700]  because I have doubled and tripled and quadrupled down. I am trying to go, I didn't breathe
[39:29.700 --> 39:37.080]  there for about a minute. I am trying to go as hard as I can against these people because
[39:37.080 --> 39:38.820]  I know the danger.
[39:38.820 --> 39:44.020]  I am fighting as hard as I can. And as some of it missteps, do I make mistakes? Yes, but
[39:44.020 --> 39:51.600]  my heart is true. I know I'm right. It was so amazing talking to Ted Nugent today, driving
[39:51.600 --> 39:55.900]  into work cuz it was even more animated in private. The things he was saying will remain
[39:55.900 --> 40:02.340]  private. But he was just like, Alex, we know in our gut, in our heart, it's not just history.
[40:02.340 --> 40:08.020]  It's not just our supporters. We know we're right. We know these people are evil.
[40:08.020 --> 40:13.340]  And it's like, wow, this is a real guy. Cuz I called him up angry and but focused and
[40:13.340 --> 40:19.080]  he was just like a laser beam. And I could tell he holds back when he's on air. I'm gonna
[40:19.080 --> 40:26.300]  tell Ted, really tell him what you stand for. Because it's strong and it's that male strength
[40:26.300 --> 40:29.300]  and energy that is going to lead by example.
[40:29.300 --> 40:35.500]  And then the women who are strong are going to see that and follow. The system has sold
[40:35.500 --> 40:39.900]  the idea of men to act weak, to act passive, act pathetic, like you're some type of lap
[40:39.900 --> 40:45.200]  dog pet. And that is not even what women really want. The globalists have made the state the
[40:45.200 --> 40:51.460]  man and the society the woman and we are wedded to the state and wedded to the devil.
[40:51.460 --> 40:56.620]  Just as the Bible says we become wedded to Christ. He's the bridegroom. Well, we've been
[40:56.620 --> 41:01.700]  wedded to the state and Hitler said that. The state will be the father. What is Chris
[41:01.700 --> 41:08.720]  Rock said? Obama is our daddy. I heard Republicans say Bush is our father. They call Uncle Joe
[41:08.720 --> 41:16.420]  Stalin father. They call Fidel Castro papa. You're not my papa. I'm not a little boy.
[41:16.420 --> 41:23.280]  I'm a man. Fidel Castro can have guns. Hitler can have guns. Fidel Castro's minions can
[41:23.280 --> 41:26.620]  have guns, but you can't have guns.
[41:26.620 --> 41:30.020]  Mao can have a gun. Political power goes out of the barrel of a gun. We're gonna go to
[41:30.020 --> 41:37.820]  this testing clip in a moment. But you, you, you, you can't have a gun. And a dirty individualist
[41:37.820 --> 41:45.060]  like an Alex Jones or a Ted Nugent or a Charlton Heston. There's nothing nastier to the collectivist
[41:45.060 --> 41:51.740]  with their armed guards and Hollywood with all this government CIA funding and their
[41:51.740 --> 41:55.780]  weapons and their gated communities, gates behind gates.
[41:55.780 --> 41:59.680]  In Hollywood, you drive into a big gate with armed guards and then there'll be another
[41:59.680 --> 42:04.060]  gate in a neighborhood to get into another gate. And then there'll be another gate on
[42:04.060 --> 42:11.700]  that house. And then a security office built off the side of the house. That's how they
[42:11.700 --> 42:18.540]  all live. And they sit there and say you're a dirty piece of garbage collectively because
[42:18.540 --> 42:21.520]  you own guns to protect yourself.
[42:21.520 --> 42:27.100]  I mean, that is a fraud. And here's the deal. They put out plenty of fake polls as of late
[42:27.100 --> 42:31.580]  saying everybody supports gun control. But Forbes went and paid one of the biggest data
[42:31.580 --> 42:37.120]  mining companies that openly, with a cookie, spies on everybody. And they published it.
[42:37.120 --> 42:41.800]  And then other data mining companies came out and said, actually, it's a total explosion
[42:41.800 --> 42:43.100]  in your face.
[42:43.100 --> 42:49.640]  You've actually made people more pro-gun. It's over 70% that are pro-gun now. This is
[42:49.640 --> 42:55.500]  actually backfired. For a few weeks with the emotion, they got maybe a 10% reduction. People
[42:55.500 --> 42:59.260]  are like, okay, I'll turn in my semi-auto, the weak-minded people. But then that made
[42:59.260 --> 43:04.620]  us supercharged with the truth in a counter-offensive, which they admitted in the data mining.
[43:04.620 --> 43:12.420]  It said it's military precision, smart bomb precision that somehow were networked. They
[43:12.420 --> 43:15.420]  can't understand it with the data mining services. You can read the Forbes and other articles
[43:15.420 --> 43:19.820]  about it. Cuz not just Forbes, there's full reports on this. What scares them is they
[43:19.820 --> 43:22.980]  say it's as if we're connected.
[43:22.980 --> 43:27.860]  We're connected to our gut, to our spirit, to our common sense. And that's when I called
[43:27.860 --> 43:33.060]  Ted Nugent, he's like, Alex, you can feel it, can't you? He goes, we're connected to
[43:33.060 --> 43:39.020]  history and honor and the truth. He goes, you can feel it, can't you? Exactly, it's
[43:39.020 --> 43:43.620]  electricity. Because you think you're not connected to your great-great-great-great-great-great
[43:43.620 --> 43:45.580]  grandfather or grandmother?
[43:45.580 --> 43:53.380]  They raised a person, your ancestor, and that person grew in their womb and was conceived
[43:53.380 --> 43:59.060]  out of that love and that passion in that hot bed with the genetics mixing. And then
[43:59.060 --> 44:03.900]  you grew in that woman's uterus. And then you came out in the world and people took
[44:03.900 --> 44:08.740]  care of you and loved you and taught you and set you up on the path.
[44:08.740 --> 44:14.220]  And had to worry about you when you went off to war and had to worry about you, but set
[44:14.220 --> 44:21.020]  you out there. It is hand-to-hand a pure chain of electricity, a total connection. You can
[44:21.020 --> 44:26.220]  reach back, if you're related to George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, and most of you have
[44:26.220 --> 44:27.500]  no idea who you're related to.
[44:27.500 --> 44:31.460]  There's an amazing history, everybody has an amazing history. You are reaching back
[44:31.460 --> 44:35.940]  into tens of thousands of people that you're related to. And all of their experiences and
[44:35.940 --> 44:41.080]  everything they've done, there is a literal, not just spiritual or psychic connection,
[44:41.080 --> 44:48.740]  there is a physical transmission. And it's directly an electrochemical, mitochondrial
[44:48.740 --> 44:53.820]  DNA carried by the women.
[44:53.820 --> 44:58.620]  And they're now finding genetic structures carried by the men on top of the genetics.
[44:58.620 --> 45:05.580]  They said that our chromosomes, our DNA is 94, 96% junk, and now they've learned, no,
[45:05.580 --> 45:12.460]  it's not. There's something else in there. It's the entire electrochemical history transmission
[45:12.460 --> 45:19.540]  recording. You call that your instinct. And man, you start tying into the race consciousness
[45:19.540 --> 45:25.500]  will of your ancestors. It is massive, it is mighty, and it is the gift that God has
[45:25.500 --> 45:27.940]  given us.
[45:27.940 --> 45:33.460]  And God's spirit of discernment energizes our very DNA. That's why so many scientists
[45:33.460 --> 45:37.980]  that were atheists are now becoming religious or Christians, because they go, my God, it's
[45:37.980 --> 45:43.860]  resonating, it's transmitting, it's transcending. And that's what all the biomechanical garbage
[45:43.860 --> 45:50.100]  of the devil is about, is to jam that and to block that, and to openly sell you tyranny
[45:50.100 --> 45:52.540]  and evil.
[45:52.540 --> 45:59.380]  Tie in to your ancestors, tie in to God's will, and you will wanna fight tyranny just
[45:59.380 --> 46:06.140]  like Charlton Heston did. It's almost 80 years old on the phone doing 40, 50, 60 interviews
[46:06.140 --> 46:10.740]  a week, sometimes 20 interviews a day. And he wouldn't even be pitching or selling something
[46:10.740 --> 46:11.740]  most of the time.
[46:11.740 --> 46:18.120]  He wouldn't even be plugging a website, he would be promoting liberty. Because he cared,
[46:18.120 --> 46:23.660]  because he was resonating with liberty. Now let's go to the Charlton Heston clip from
[46:23.660 --> 46:27.500]  the grave he lives on, here it is.
[46:27.500 --> 46:36.140]  Every time our country stands in the path of danger, an instinct seems to summon her
[46:36.140 --> 46:43.340]  finest first. Those who truly understand her. When freedom shivers in the cold shadow of
[46:43.340 --> 46:52.660]  true peril, it's always the patriots who first hear the call. When loss of liberty is looming
[46:52.660 --> 47:01.300]  as it is now, the siren sounds first in the hearts of freedom's vanguard. The smoke in
[47:01.300 --> 47:10.620]  the air of our concord bridges and pearl harbors is always smelled first by the farmers who
[47:10.620 --> 47:18.840]  come from their simple homes to find the fire and fight. Because they know that sacred stuff
[47:18.840 --> 47:26.580]  resides in that wooden stock and blued steel. Something that gives the most common man the
[47:26.580 --> 47:35.180]  most uncommon of freedoms. When ordinary hands can possess such an extraordinary instrument,
[47:35.180 --> 47:43.200]  that symbolizes the full measure of human dignity and liberty. That's why those five
[47:43.200 --> 47:53.740]  words issue an irresistible call to us all and we must.
[47:53.740 --> 48:11.580]  So I hope that when my days are spent that I can say that I was an honorable man like
[48:11.580 --> 48:19.140]  you. So as we set out this year to defeat the divisive forces that would take freedom
[48:19.140 --> 48:26.860]  away, I want to say those fighting words for everyone within the sound of my voice to hear
[48:26.860 --> 48:43.340]  and to heed and especially for you, Mr. Gore, from my cold, dead hands.
[48:43.340 --> 48:47.220]  And again, he was a truly honorable person. You can look back in hindsight and say, well,
[48:47.220 --> 48:52.080]  Bush was bad, too, but none of us could know how bad. But imagine how bad Al Gore would
[48:52.080 --> 48:58.700]  have been using a 9-11 to totally take over. But the point is, is that Al Gore was saying
[48:58.700 --> 49:03.060]  ban the semi-autos, make you turn them in. And Charlton Heston understood how dangerous
[49:03.060 --> 49:11.900]  that was. But the point is, in that speech, that timeless speech, we really see the hammer
[49:11.900 --> 49:18.700]  and the chisel that can be used to cut and break our chains and really recognize that
[49:18.700 --> 49:24.900]  Hollywood isn't a bunch of liberal buffoons. These are globalist psych warfare technicians
[49:24.900 --> 49:26.220]  who have an agenda.
[49:26.220 --> 49:31.460]  And I've talked to many Hollywood people. If you're pro-gun, you don't get the roles.
[49:31.460 --> 49:36.660]  I've talked to major rock stars, and I'm not talking about Billy Corrigan or folks like
[49:36.660 --> 49:44.580]  Dave Mustaine, who are on record. But I've talked to other major rock stars, in fact,
[49:44.580 --> 49:49.560]  people that are even currently, you could say, bigger. And they're like, I can't come
[49:49.560 --> 49:54.280]  on your show. They're giving me too much heat just for linking to your website or talking
[49:54.280 --> 49:55.580]  about you.
[49:55.580 --> 49:59.180]  And I've been told that I'm not gonna be booked in the venues or put back on television if
[49:59.180 --> 50:07.220]  I do this. So I wanna go play the major venues. And they tell people that. They come to them
[50:07.220 --> 50:12.980]  and they tell them. They tell famous country music singers that. They tell major rock stars
[50:12.980 --> 50:15.700]  that. They tell Hollywood stars that.
[50:15.700 --> 50:19.780]  They told Tom Selleck that. You're not gonna get roles, pal, no matter if you're a major
[50:19.780 --> 50:24.580]  leading man, number one in the 80s. You're done. You're not gonna get financing. You're
[50:24.580 --> 50:29.980]  not gonna get promoted. You're gonna get zero if you don't play ball. And then you've got
[50:29.980 --> 50:33.940]  people like Bruckheimer and folks that are totally committed to the New World Order,
[50:33.940 --> 50:37.260]  Steven Spielberg, others.
[50:37.260 --> 50:43.820]  And it's just atrocious. And I don't like being a slave of propaganda. I don't like
[50:43.820 --> 50:50.820]  it. And it made me nauseous to see the patheticness of Jim Carrey and all these people. Folks
[50:50.820 --> 50:54.620]  are like, well, why do you care? They're just scum. The point is, yeah, why is this scum
[50:54.620 --> 51:01.260]  ruling us? Okay, they need to be overturned.
[51:01.260 --> 51:05.180]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day. If you're
[51:05.180 --> 51:10.900]  listening, you know the economy is not getting better. You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.

[52:00.740 --> 52:04.520]  Is this the year you finally get serious about your family's drinking water? If so, keep
[52:04.520 --> 52:08.620]  listening for a special offer from Big Berkey Water Filters. Did you know that over 60%
[52:08.620 --> 52:12.020]  of municipal water is fluoridated? Berkey water filters distinguish themselves from
[52:12.020 --> 52:16.220]  many other filtration systems with the capability to significantly reduce dangerous chlorine,
[52:16.220 --> 52:19.780]  fluoride, arsenic, and disinfection byproducts from municipal water via the Black Berkey
[52:19.780 --> 52:25.020]  and PF line of filters. Then there's affordability. At only 1.7 cents per gallon, Berkey water
[52:25.020 --> 52:29.060]  filters purify treated and untreated water, even stagnant pond water. Stop and think how

[54:25.900 --> 54:31.940]  five after in the second hour to respond to just how they demonize gun owners and blame
[54:31.940 --> 54:36.760]  us collectively for any type of crime when we actually have lowered crime everywhere
[54:36.760 --> 54:41.540]  where we proliferated firearms. I mean, it's a no brainer, but we're trying to argue with
[54:41.540 --> 54:48.340]  them with facts. They're criminals. The globalists know that if free people have guns, they know
[54:48.340 --> 54:52.060]  that's the basic instinct for us to be armed and that they want to be the ones with the
[54:52.060 --> 54:58.780]  guns. They fetishize guns. They fetishize state power. I mean, Buzz Bissinger and others
[54:58.780 --> 55:05.300]  on that show, the guy that admits he spends $600,000 a year on women's clothing and stuff.
[55:05.300 --> 55:12.020]  I mean, just fine, whatever. Just compulsive maniac. Him and Piers Morgan get up there
[55:12.020 --> 55:18.420]  and talk about how they fantasize about him wearing a police uniform and killing me. And
[55:18.420 --> 55:24.060]  then the woman, the ambassador's daughter, Huntsman, goes, ooh, yeah, ooh. And they're
[55:24.060 --> 55:26.260]  all like, ooh, let's kill.
[55:26.260 --> 55:33.580]  It's because you haven't ever been in a fistfight. Maybe Piers Morgan has. You've never seen
[55:33.580 --> 55:38.420]  people die. I bet you don't pull over when you see a car wreck. When somebody's arms
[55:38.420 --> 55:43.860]  chopped off and blood spraying 14 feet, you people are cowards. You're the people, if
[55:43.860 --> 55:47.740]  somebody's dying in the ditch, you walk on by. I see it. Or if somebody's choking in
[55:47.740 --> 55:52.140]  a restaurant, you call 911. You people are cowards, okay?
[55:52.140 --> 55:57.580]  It's more than that they're just authoritarians. They play at being authoritarians. But behind
[55:57.580 --> 56:02.460]  them are the real authoritarians that have millions of dead on their hands, the globalists.
[56:02.460 --> 56:07.220]  The UN is going around worldwide just lining up people and just shooting whole villages.
[56:07.220 --> 56:15.860]  And it's in the New York Times like it's no big deal. From El Salvador to Honduras to
[56:15.860 --> 56:21.620]  the Central Africa in the Congo, they're lining people up and shooting them. But you don't
[56:21.620 --> 56:22.900]  want those guns taken.
[56:22.900 --> 56:28.180]  Type in Chinese executions, thousands of photos at sports stadiums blowing 12-year-olds' heads
[56:28.180 --> 56:32.820]  off. For some reason it's like teenagers that misbehave. You shoplifted, boom, your head's
[56:32.820 --> 56:36.860]  blown off. You talk back to the cops, you're dead. We're gonna harvest your organs. And
[56:36.860 --> 56:41.800]  they've got them bringing the dead bodies with sheets and blood into mobile execution
[56:41.800 --> 56:45.420]  vans where they chop their organs up.
[56:45.420 --> 56:50.320]  You're never gonna hear Jim Carrey talk about that because he's an authoritarian pig worshiper.
[56:50.320 --> 56:56.500]  He worships evil. The same with all of them, they know what they're doing. Yeah, let's
[56:56.500 --> 57:03.760]  not for TV viewers, good job throwing it up, but let's not put it on the main TV broadcast
[57:03.760 --> 57:05.220]  in case people don't wanna look at it.
[57:05.220 --> 57:10.380]  It's unbelievable, just type in Chinese executions. Type in Chinese suicide nets and you search
[57:10.380 --> 57:16.260]  deep enough to take the safe search off. You could see shots of like 20, 30 bodies hanging
[57:16.260 --> 57:20.980]  dead that have bounced off the nets. And I mean, it's unbelievable. I mean, mass suicides,
[57:20.980 --> 57:21.980]  hell on earth.
[57:21.980 --> 57:26.000]  Let's not discuss that. China launching drone armies, the globalists moving their command
[57:26.000 --> 57:34.460]  base there. They have execution parades in China. I mean, it's just incredible. And again,
[57:34.460 --> 57:39.860]  these aren't of child molesters or murderers. These are of people that, I saw one report
[57:39.860 --> 57:44.020]  where a Western journalist saw the police beat a guy up and chop his genitals off in
[57:44.020 --> 57:45.020]  front of everyone.
[57:45.020 --> 57:49.580]  And everybody watched him bleed to death there on the side of the street. I mean, that's
[57:49.580 --> 57:53.140]  what the globalists want us to live like, that's their plan. Ted Nugent's coming up.

[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:35.700]  Texas, Alex Jones. Ted Nugent is scheduled to be on with us in the next segment to talk
[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:46.540]  about the incredible demonization of gun owners and the new poster boy of distasteful, tyrannical
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:55.380]  worship of corruption and victim disarmament. The worship of statism and hypocrisy, the
[01:00:55.380 --> 01:01:03.500]  worship of pulling down real men. I'm talking about Jim Carrey, the obvious mentally ill
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:10.940]  twit, who put out a video, and I have the text of it here, where they say that Charlton
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:15.660]  Heston is responsible for the dead children in America, that he is a vulture and a coyote
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:19.460]  and that he will not go to heaven, he will go to hell.
[01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:24.540]  And that he basically pulled the trigger on the children at Sandy Hook. That's basically
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:30.580]  what it implies. And they show him as a complete kook who believes that space aliens are gonna
[01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:38.020]  exploit our every weakness and suck our brains out. I mean, it's just not even funny. And
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:44.580]  you watch a bunch of bad actors running around acting goofy, and it's not even a good piece.
[01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:50.260]  And I don't want to hate Jim Carrey. I always knew there was something wrong with him. He's
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:51.260]  more of a geek.
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:56.780]  And people think of a geek as a guy that's into computers. Geeks were people at circuses
[01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:03.500]  that would bite the heads off of pigeons and animals and things. And the obese man, the
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:10.900]  bearded lady, that's a geek. It's called geeking. And he's a geek. And I guess we're all a geek
[01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:11.900]  at some level.
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:19.460]  I mean, I have trouble maintaining my composure because reality is such a deep, wide spectrum
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:25.260]  of thought. But I'm just sick of hypocrites with armed guards and bodyguards and behind
[01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:31.900]  triple gates worth hundreds of millions of dollars, disstaining the common people who
[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:41.580]  are having every basic liberty stripped away from them at an accelerated rate.
[01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:46.060]  We're having our liberties pulled away from us. And then what did Obama say? He didn't
[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:49.740]  know he's being recorded to million dollar type donors in San Francisco. He said, we're
[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:56.980]  gonna get these better cleaners. All they've got is their Bibles and their guns. And they're
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:02.260]  federalizing the churches and they're going after the guns because they know they don't
[01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:05.440]  want you having your own beliefs, whether beliefs are right or wrong.
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:10.780]  They don't want you having beliefs that aren't theirs. They want you to be a biological android.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:14.740]  They wanna program you. They want you to turn your kids over to them so they can program
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:23.340]  them in the public schools. And I for one have had enough of it. I for one am just thinking
[01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:27.740]  of every way I can get aggressive, every way I can show the power of liberty, every way
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:29.380]  I can get in the face of the New World Order.
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:33.000]  And if that means they set me up and prison me, kill me, whatever it is, that's the way
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:39.700]  it is, okay? Because that's not something I look forward to, but it's an honor. I mean,
[01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:45.280]  I am committed. And if everybody was committed, we turn this around very quickly. But people
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:53.100]  think groveling and living in denial, they think that that is going to be somehow the
[01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:55.100]  road to victory.
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:04:02.660]  And it's not, it's the road to perdition. And so it's time to commit and to get past
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:06.660]  your fear and to become a leader and to stand up against these tyrants and say, we know
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:11.660]  you're authoritarians. We know you're criminals. We know you're hypocrites. We know you're
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:18.060]  our mortal enemy. There's always been horrible tyrants. There's always been corrupt gangs.
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:20.100]  There's always been groups that come in and try to take over.
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:24.620]  And now it's happening again. And the globalists are shutting America down as fast as they
[01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:29.500]  can to make you dependent on them. And they can just bring in the global garbage from
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:34.700]  countries they've already conquered. But we are aware of that historically and at a gut
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:40.500]  level. And we are together in history and this is a challenge. This is a hell of a time
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:41.500]  to be alive.
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:47.060]  It's not work fighting tyranny. It's not work standing up for Chuck Heston. It is an honor
[01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:51.980]  just as generations after us when we restore liberty will stand up for us when we're being
[01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:56.180]  demonized. As you know, down the road, they'll still be tyrants. They'll still be scum. They'll
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:05:02.780]  be demonizing Ted Nugent, Alex Jones, Ron Paul after we're gone.

[01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:05.260]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:09.900]  good sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well known fact
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:14.140]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:19.540]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:24.860]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be
[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:30.380]  healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:23.820]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. It's
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:30.600]  been out for a couple of days but didn't get attention until last night. It was in some
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:38.780]  of the establishment, uh, prostitute media, the dinosaur media praising Jim Carrey. Hey,
[01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:43.780]  uh, I've seen him in interviews. I mean, I think he genuinely is mentally ill. He's kind
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:48.900]  of a geek. That's why it's funny to watch him literally denigrate and in this disgusting
[01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:49.900]  five minute song.
[01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:54.460]  And we're gonna go over some of the lyrics to it here today. And it's got some profanity
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:09:00.380]  so we won't play all of it. Say that gun owners, but the Chuck Heston, Charlton Heston, a true
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:07.100]  humanitarian, a true civil rights activist, a patriot that he is guilty for dead kids
[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:12.500]  that he won't be going to heaven and that he's mentally ill and believes in space aliens.
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:17.060]  And it was just so ham fisted and so pathetic. I got angry and I figured it out last night.
[01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:20.340]  I couldn't even go to sleep, folks, and I can go to sleep in like one minute. I can
[01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:23.940]  just turn my brain off. I was so upset. I couldn't go to bed till like two in the morning.
[01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:30.480]  I shot like three videos for the YouTube channel because I realized these people are so pathetic
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:36.980]  and such liars and such hypocrites with their bodyguards and so anti individual and so wrong
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:42.380]  and so authoritarian that I'm angry that we have not routed them out.
[01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:50.620]  Now I called a very busy individual, but he's obviously very angry about what's happening
[01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:54.860]  as well. I talked to him this morning on a cell phone. Ted Nugent, who needs no introduction,
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:10:02.380]  NRA board member, top rock and roller patriot, Hunter. I called him on a cell phone a couple
[01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:05.140]  hours ago and I said, can you come on about Charlton Heston?
[01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:08.020]  I know you were very good friends with him and really got him to get more hardcore on
[01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:12.700]  the Second Amendment. He said, absolutely. It was Ted Nugent that helped supercharge
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:19.160]  Charlton Heston into the fight at many levels. So here is his friend to defend Chuck Charlton
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:23.860]  Heston because he can't do it. He's dead. But again, Charlton Heston will live forever
[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:26.020]  as long as Liberty lives.
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:30.720]  And so understand that, ladies and gentlemen, this is a big deal when people literally desecrate
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:37.860]  the grave of a man who would do 50 plus interviews a week when he was almost 80 years old and
[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:41.980]  who would travel the country for nothing, no money to defend the Second Amendment. And
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:47.500]  I knew him. I had a chance to talk to him off air. He was the real deal and probably
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:51.300]  the classiest person I've ever had the pleasure to get to know a little bit.
[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:55.780]  And I'll be honest, I don't envy many things. I envy Ted Nugent being such good friends
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:59.040]  with him. Ted, you've got the floor, my friend. You've got the floor. Thank you for coming
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:05.140]  on TedNugent.com. I know you're about to go on your Black Power tour, but we appreciate
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:06.500]  you giving us time today.
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:09.980]  Yes, sir. You've got the floor. Well, Alex, thank you for that. I appreciate it. But salute
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:16.340]  back at you because there's no question that the great American legend and icon, a true
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:22.580]  warrior, a true hero, Charlton Heston, deserves nothing but respect from thinking, caring,
[01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:24.780]  conscientious, educated people.
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:30.820]  But again, as we talked before about the gift from God that Piers Morgan represents, I mean,
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:37.300]  God literally sent Piers Morgan from England to try to debate the Second Amendment. So
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:42.700]  you literally couldn't come up with Alfred E. Newman versus an audition for One Flew
[01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:49.060]  Over the Cuckoo's Nest with a better representative of a guy who hates freedom and hates the Second
[01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:53.780]  Amendment and hates Ted Nugent and Alex Orange and hates the NRA and hates self-defense and
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:59.380]  hates guns. And I think we are not here so much to defend Charlton Heston because once
[01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:08.300]  again, God has sent a complete brain-dead, soulless punk to desecrate the absolutely
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:13.300]  well-earned and deserved glowing reputation of the great Charlton Heston.
[01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:18.540]  And what Jim Carrey has done, and I've been all over, we have a talk back at TedNugent.com
[01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:23.180]  and we have thousands of people from all around the world that come to celebrate self-evident
[01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:27.260]  truth and common sense. You know, the same communication that you get, Alex, from people
[01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:32.500]  who understand, you know, history, the evidence that brought us to the greatest experience
[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:39.300]  and the greatest quality of life in America. And when a guy like Jim Carrey pulls off this
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:45.340]  kind of mean-spirited, soulless, I think the best word to describe Jim Carrey and Piers
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:51.060]  Morgan and guys like, you know, Michael, I'm still looking for personal hygiene more. They're
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:58.740]  all one big gaggle of soulless punks. And I would understand, and I understand when
[01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:05.140]  a person is uneducated and ignorant and hates America and hates self-defense and doesn't
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:10.380]  believe in self-defense. But then again, if you examine Michael Moore and his armed security
[01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:18.020]  detail, if you examine Jim Carrey and his armed security detail, when you examine Michael
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:22.700]  Bloomberg and Governor Cuomo and Nancy, you don't have to read this, you need to sign
[01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:27.900]  it Pelosi, and of course our favorite gun runner, Eric Holder, when you examine the
[01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:33.660]  freedom haters who hate guns and want to do everything on film stating clearly they would
[01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:41.500]  take away all the guns if they could, these people are perfect to represent the other
[01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:50.220]  side because when they open their mouth, yes, we have an unfortunate and a tragic percentage
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:57.820]  of Americans who are more like sheep than we the people that support these freedom haters.
[01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:04.780]  When they speak, common sense America, people who have jobs, people who put their heart
[01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:08.860]  and soul into being the best that they can be, people who appreciate the gift of life,
[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:15.060]  the sacred gift of life, and our moral, intellectual, and spiritual obligation to defend that life
[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:20.460]  and that the Second Amendment was written down to remind us we have the individual God-given
[01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:30.580]  right to defend that precious gift of life, good people understand the pure rot from Jim
[01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:40.900]  Carey, so in his grave, Alex, let's really examine this, from the grave, the great Charlton
[01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:48.740]  Heston represents hate to the Jim Carries of the world and I think Charlton Heston if
[01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:54.420]  we could communicate with him, he would be smiling right now, he wouldn't be hurt, he
[01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:58.700]  would be smiling because Charlton Heston knew the culture war was coming before any of us
[01:14:58.700 --> 01:14:59.700]  did, Alex.
[01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:05.980]  No, he was there sounding, he was there sounding the alarm and he is just like our forebears
[01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:09.940]  fight from the grave for liberty with their statements and the Second Amendment they laid
[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:18.820]  down, Charlton Heston is like an El Cid strapped dead on the horse out there terrifying the
[01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:19.820]  enemy.
[01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:26.380]  And here's the beauty, Charlton Heston would be more than proud to cause much anguish and
[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:36.420]  insanity in the soulless vacuum of Jim Carrey's brain or his skull, Charlton Heston is like
[01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:43.340]  you and I, Alex, only he's better, and he is just giddy with joy that he has inspired
[01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:54.620]  Jim Carrey to become even dumber than dumb and to be just this toxic source of indecency
[01:15:54.620 --> 01:16:02.340]  and mean spirit and hate, Charlton Heston isn't even alive and he caused Jim Carrey
[01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:05.140]  to expose his soullessness.
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:12.540]  So don't underestimate in the culture war more important than the lie of holding for
[01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:20.180]  Columbine by Michael no hygiene more and Nancy no soul Pelosi and Diane I've got a gun but
[01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:24.860]  you don't get to have one Feinstein I mean that the list goes on of just hypocritical
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:32.860]  brain dead subhuman punks or not to mention Alex the Vice President of the United States
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:40.860]  recommending felonies live on TV you got to be kidding me Alex again if you and I were
[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:48.060]  to sit down with all the greatest minds on earth the most clever educated witty brilliant
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:56.180]  minds on earth we couldn't design an enemy that looks more ridiculous than Nancy Pelosi
[01:16:56.180 --> 01:17:04.940]  Diane Feinstein Joe Biden Barack Obama Eric Holder Jim Carrey Michael Moore ad nauseum
[01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:11.580]  so yes it is hurtful and it does inspire righteous indignation and we should be angry but we
[01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:18.140]  should also take a deep breath and go hey Jim do it again because you're distancing
[01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:24.460]  yourself further every time you open your imbecilic mouth surrounded by your arm security
[01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:31.260]  details demanding that the rest of us don't get to have any security so Alex I know it
[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:40.860]  hurts and it's ugly but you know what I think in the in Nuremberg 1938 we got there late
[01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:47.340]  but when we finally got there we made those subhuman Nazi brown shirt punks walk through
[01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:56.620]  Auschwitz and look what they caused look what they did and this Jim Carrey moment is a mirror
[01:17:56.620 --> 01:18:04.380]  that we can show somebody hopefully soon that these people enhance crime they encourage
[01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:13.660]  crime they facilitate and guarantee more innocent dead citizens sure because they're well that's
[01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:20.700]  it they know Ted Nugent joining us they know crimes drop 49% violent crime FBI statistics
[01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:27.140]  since 1991 as the guns go up the crime goes down they know that so it is a criminal instinct
[01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:32.780]  of hypocrisy to want to dominate us because they're collectivist but end up getting our
[01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:39.100]  banker bailout money they are just lawless parasites Michael Moore all of them they know
[01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:44.580]  exactly Diane Feinstein she's got her own gun she's got her own security detail they
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:54.060]  have this this this crowd say a criminal instinct to disarm us absolutely we need any more evidence
[01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:59.300]  than the number one cop in the in the free world running guns to Mexican drug gangs are
[01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:05.260]  you kidding me again we couldn't write a planet of the H meets one flew over the cuckoo's
[01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:10.500]  nest by Alfred E Newman that's dumber than this scenario and they get away with it that's
[01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:13.260]  what you see that's why I got so mad by the video and we're going to break here but I
[01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:18.300]  want your take on this that they are so pathetic that's why it made me so mad it was nauseating
[01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:22.900]  how stupid they are and how ridiculous but then we're we're we're they're they're still
[01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:28.180]  taking over there's these there's these idiots everywhere that think think that's funny well

[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:43.980]  because you were so focused it was really focused anger and you were talking about the fact this is
[01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:48.260]  a war because I mean these collectivists they don't want to just go into the Second Amendment
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:57.300]  they want to expunge everything I mean they are literally taking over and the problem is so many
[01:24:57.300 --> 01:25:01.660]  of the Republicans are part of this as well I think everybody who loves liberty needs to get
[01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:08.060]  really aggressive so I think it's a change in our guts and you talked about just knowing we're right
[01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:16.540]  Ted Nugent. Well again you know the term self-evident truth isn't shouted often enough from the mountain tops of our daily lives Alex
[01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:22.060]  again we salute you for doing that and we salute everybody out there again I constantly reference
[01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:28.300]  the curse of apathy the self-inflicted suicide of disconnected sheep in America but again only
[01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:40.220]  the guilty need to feel guilty some guys go well I'm not a sheep I'm involved well then I'm not talking about you pal but we know sheep we all have sheep in our lives we know someone who shrugs their
[01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:50.860]  shoulder and goes yeah I believe in the Second Amendment but there's no reason we should own a machine gun you know what I mean we need to take these people and fix them and get rid of the
[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:57.020]  self-inflicted curse of apathy because the term self-evident truth what you rail about the
[01:25:57.020 --> 01:26:05.020]  culture war in our face the fact that a Chicago gangster a manipulating acorn communist hanging
[01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:14.220]  out with deceitful scam artist Barack Obama has weaseled his way into the White House if that's
[01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:22.460]  not an indicator that too many Americans are sound asleep then I really don't know what else I can tell
[01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:28.700]  you but we know it to be true but the answers are not mysterious the remedy is not mysterious this
[01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:36.300]  isn't rocket scientist an experiment self-government is in our guts it's in our soul it's the most
[01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:42.700]  powerful instinct to pursue your individual happiness to know that God gave us each an
[01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:47.500]  individual right as outlined succinctly and eloquently for the first time in the history
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:52.300]  of mankind in the U.S. Constitution the Bill of Rights the Declaration of Independence
[01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:56.780]  my god we've got to communicate with this to our elected officials and again I'm going to repeat
[01:26:56.780 --> 01:27:04.940]  this till I blow up NRA memberships there aren't enough of them the most powerful sucker punch in
[01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:10.780]  the solar plexus of the Nancy Pelosi and Feinstein's and Michael Moore and Jim Carries of the world
[01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:19.100]  is numbers NRA members exactly exactly just to back you up Bloomberg has now raised 14 million
[01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:24.780]  dollars off the dead kids at Sandy Hook the victim disarmament zone that he helped nationwide set up
[01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:31.100]  so if anybody's guilty it's him he's trying to collectively make us guilty he raised 14 million
[01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:36.700]  dollars to run around and pay off police chiefs and local governments to come out against guns
[01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:43.660]  and we have to take it personal when these people do this we have to give money to the NRA and
[01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:48.940]  gun owners of America and your state gun groups folks you've got to give time energy you've got
[01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:55.100]  to support alternative media platforms libertarian true conservative what about this what about how
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:28:00.140]  homeland security is now buying billions of bullets armored vehicles and saying the number
[01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:05.340]  one terror threat is gun owners conservatives libertarians I mean talk about twilight zone
[01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:11.340]  outer limits we now know that that they are taking over homeland security as another branch
[01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:17.500]  of the military it's become the fifth branch trying to point it at us the curse of apathy
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:24.700]  and the political correct scourge of denial you mean what you just mentioned Alex you know I'm

[01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:41.100]  and pragmatism that brings independent quality of life and i celebrate and promote those things i
[01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:47.820]  started promoting never defending i have never defended the second amendment or back straps i've
[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:57.100]  never defended anything i promote and celebrate all good things self-evident truth logic goodwill
[01:38:57.100 --> 01:39:05.340]  decency and the american way and i found out as early as 1965 1966 the beatniks were morphing into
[01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:12.860]  the hippies and they hated me and i i said that for a minute i go you hate me because i believe
[01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:19.900]  in self-defense and i eat venison are you kidding me but here's the bottom line i would love to get
[01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:26.620]  pelosi and boxer and feinstein and michael moore and jim carrey and bill marr and pierce morgan
[01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:34.940]  i'd like them to get on film and admit how much dope have you smoking how many mind alter and i'm
[01:39:34.940 --> 01:39:44.540]  not alleging they have allegedly they talk and conduct themselves like cesspools of mind-altering
[01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:51.740]  drugs and i bet you if you got everybody that hates ted nugent and alex jones and the nra
[01:39:51.740 --> 01:39:57.340]  and freedom in america if you've got all of them to take some truth serum and look in the camera
[01:39:57.340 --> 01:40:04.220]  admit how much mind-altering substance abuse they've subjected themselves to for how long
[01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:09.820]  no one would be surprised that they are timothy leary run amok
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:15.580]  and that's what you can express from those kind of people when you have intentionally
[01:40:15.580 --> 01:40:20.460]  poisoned and destroyed your brain you can come out with a video like jim carrey has well let me
[01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:23.580]  throw this at you briefly and then get into all those other topics we talked about during the
[01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:27.340]  break again ted nugent's our guest if you just tuned in and he's on fire today after they've
[01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:32.620]  tried to desecrate and demonize charlton heston i believe it will will blow up in their face buzz
[01:40:32.620 --> 01:40:39.740]  bissinger was on uh the piers morgan show a few days after i was on there and he said you know
[01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:46.140]  we ought to get him in here and shoot him and then the ambassador's daughter huntsman's daughter and
[01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:52.540]  morgan agree and say yeah i'll put on a police uniform and they fetishize that real creepy
[01:40:52.540 --> 01:40:58.060]  and we'll shoot alex jones and then buzz bissinger has now come out and admitted he likes to buy
[01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:04.300]  six hundred thousand dollars a year of women's clothing and i mean my whole issue is what what
[01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:11.100]  is the point of this i mean you know this guy is if i said kill him which i'm not i mean that's
[01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:16.940]  like going out in the yard stepping on dog crap if i said kill him i would be arrested he said
[01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:21.980]  kill me and then it's a joke these people fetishize killing us and they're constantly
[01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:26.620]  talking about killing constitutionalists there's you know there's so many examples of this
[01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:32.380]  with people like alec baldwin you name it i mean that's why our instincts you know and again if we
[01:41:32.380 --> 01:41:37.740]  go back to what made america great we didn't meet the british punks at concord bridge to make them
[01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:43.340]  key and have have a discussion but blew their brains out that's how you stop tyrants that's
[01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:48.940]  how you stop king george that's how you stop despots and emperors and punks that want to
[01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:54.380]  control your life and an oppressed freedom you meet them at concord bridge and you blow their
[01:41:54.380 --> 01:42:01.660]  damn brains out that's what we did in 1776 because we'd about had enough and so when you made that
[01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:08.460]  statement on pierce morgan i've seen the the transcript all i can say is hello self-evident
[01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:14.300]  truth common sense and history is not up for discussion it is what it is but now in the
[01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:22.940]  culture war it is important that we let them talk we let them threaten our lives we let them call
[01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:28.620]  the greatest maybe one of the greatest heroes of the civil rights movement next to dr martin luther
[01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:34.700]  king jr and others that sacrifice so much the freedom marchers and so many charlton heston
[01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:46.780]  is the most revered and earned reputation icon and hero alex so let kim carrey show his evil side
[01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:56.940]  let him carry lie his entire video is a lie and these punks like bill mar cannot separate their
[01:42:56.940 --> 01:43:04.860]  humor license their creative humor license from the respect due to a great man like charlton heston
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:10.940]  so it's good that they take the bait but we the people who still understand the foundation of the
[01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:14.060]  greatest quality of life in the history of the world is outlined in the bill of rights in the
[01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:19.020]  u.s constitution declaration of independence the ten commandments the golden rule those of us that
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:26.300]  are in the asset column of america we still are running short of our responsibilities to educate
[01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:32.940]  inspire and and prod everyone in our lives there's an enormous army that could have won this last
[01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:39.500]  election alex if all of us that knew the truth and knew the evidence if we shared it and we asked and
[01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:45.500]  we really pushed harder to get our friends to join the nra to communicate with their election
[01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:53.900]  officials and to speak up there's still too many sheep in america and the sheep dogs need to educate
[01:43:53.900 --> 01:44:01.340]  them so we can reduce the wolves you're right and in closing on the point of charlton heston
[01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:08.860]  before we get into solutions uh so many people that support liberty are just quiet and uh you
[01:44:08.860 --> 01:44:14.220]  know they're sitting back and and they're waiting of the system pushes too much and as andrew
[01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:18.220]  jackson said don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes you know i understand the point of
[01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:23.980]  let the enemy run amok that's what's discrediting polls show that people are more pro-gun now than
[01:44:23.980 --> 01:44:29.260]  they were just six months ago there's a new cbs poll out they're very upset that their whole
[01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:34.140]  hoax has failed but at the same time they've still got control of the government and the bureaucracy
[01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:41.580]  because they crave the control how do we really get on the offense as individuals i say go to city
[01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:45.980]  councils i say get in the face of police chiefs that are anti-gun i mean i mean my own police
[01:44:45.980 --> 01:44:51.660]  chief in austin says uh you know turn in your semi-autos ban high-capacity clips ban gun shows
[01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:56.380]  you can't buy your son a gun no private sales you don't need a semi-auto to protect yourself well
[01:44:56.380 --> 01:45:00.380]  then how about the austin police who i know most of them are good people how about you turn in your
[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:05.820]  semi-autos what a load of bull what do you say to that well he's obviously the illegitimate stepchild
[01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:11.980]  of ann richards um that still exists i mean chela jackson lee is alive and well in texas so we've
[01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:17.180]  got we've got anti-freedom we got hypocrites because i guarantee that chief of police has
[01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:24.700]  a semi-auto to protect his family alex are you kidding me well again it's communication uh i've
[01:45:24.700 --> 01:45:29.180]  been doing this forever i think i was one of the first guys to find myself face to face with the
[01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:34.380]  whites of their eyes in the culture war back in the 1960s because the tip of that spear has always
[01:45:34.380 --> 01:45:39.740]  been gun rights and hunting rights private property hunting conservation we the people own
[01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:46.060]  those resources not the king so i gotta tell you i'm gonna put out a salute right now to ranger
[01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:52.460]  test and go-kart and steve and and and so many guys that might talk back blood trails i have
[01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:58.380]  thousands and thousands of people not just from the united states but canada japan australia
[01:45:58.380 --> 01:46:04.700]  germany england belgium sweden i mean people from all around the world will dream of who crave and
[01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:10.540]  have the instinct to be independent and free they come to ted nugent.com talkback and a salute to
[01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:15.820]  them because for every talkbacker that you and i communicate with they need to communicate with
[01:46:15.820 --> 01:46:21.420]  another dozen and those doesn't need to communicate with another dozen that's how we win this culture
[01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:26.780]  war we have not turned up the heat we have not got aggressive enough but we always have to be on the
[01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:35.420]  civil polite goodwill and decency side and let the jim carrys spew their venom let them expose
[01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:40.700]  themselves for the haters and the freedom haters and the america haters that they are and if we
[01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:46.140]  remain civil with the stats and statistics and evidence at our at our fingertips and at the tip
[01:46:46.140 --> 01:46:51.340]  of our tongue alex we will win that's why i salute you that's what you're doing and everybody
[01:46:51.340 --> 01:46:56.060]  listening they don't need to call alex and say thank you they need to call everybody else in
[01:46:56.060 --> 01:47:03.980]  their lives and get them going you're right let's get into solutions talk about because you got cut
[01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:09.020]  off by the break the dhs situation it's admitting there's an arm build up that they're trying to
[01:47:09.020 --> 01:47:14.700]  create this new domestic security force pointed at the american people but then i want to hear
[01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:19.820]  about the delta force and seals and people you know you were telling me off air how incredibly
[01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:24.780]  awake they're getting and then let's talk about let's talk about solutions the gun culture they're
[01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:31.260]  so afraid of that's spreading going and and and literally getting somebody into guns that one
[01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:36.780]  person after another that's how we're truly going to win and you see it happening all across this
[01:47:36.780 --> 01:47:41.980]  country yeah it's like you're chief of police in austin isn't it isn't that a heartbreaker
[01:47:41.980 --> 01:47:48.860]  that a texas law enforcement officer sides with nancy pelosi i mean are you kidding me
[01:47:48.860 --> 01:47:54.700]  so what do you do pee at the wall of the alamo like ozzy osborne i i'm just heartbroken because
[01:47:54.700 --> 01:48:01.900]  i know a bunch of those austin cops but here's the final overview i you know i'm a lucky guy
[01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:07.820]  i get to hang and barbecue and hunt and train with the greatest commando hero warriors that
[01:48:07.820 --> 01:48:15.180]  ever lived i mean i am so humbled i'm surprised i can even grovel at their feet delta force navy
[01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:23.420]  seals uh the special ops the the army rangers swat commanders and heroes of law enforcement
[01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:30.300]  and military all across this land i held the hand of sergeant todd balding who happened to be from
[01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:39.260]  austin alex i held his hand over in iraq he took an rpg center mass i'll try not to cry on your
[01:48:39.260 --> 01:48:48.540]  radio show here the young black man 22 years old rpg center mass alex it was still in his guts
[01:48:50.220 --> 01:48:57.180]  i stood there in his blood and i held his hand as he died wow i don't need any more inspiration
[01:48:57.180 --> 01:49:07.660]  he died because he swore an oath mr chief of police to enforce abide by and fight for and die
[01:49:07.660 --> 01:49:16.220]  for the u.s constitution do you think i need some punk some dependent little whiny soulless
[01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:22.700]  doped up crybaby like jim carrey to give me direction on constitutional and bill of rights
[01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:29.340]  guaranteed god-given individual rights are you kidding me so everybody close their eyes right
[01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:35.980]  now unless you're driving and think of todd balding as he bled to death he took his giant
[01:49:35.980 --> 01:49:43.820]  ugly rpg rocket right in the guts and he bled to death fighting for freedom and going after
[01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:51.980]  terrorists who attack americans because of their voodoo alla puke muslim insanity and if that's
[01:49:51.980 --> 01:49:56.780]  not worth inspiring you to join the nra to communicate with your elected officials and
[01:49:56.780 --> 01:50:00.780]  do your duty as we the people that i don't think there's any hope for you and you're probably out
[01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:08.700]  of just moved to canada well it really is disgusting that that these people parade around
[01:50:08.700 --> 01:50:13.740]  in fact since you mentioned that and i want to talk about uh the tour and and and the culture
[01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:20.700]  war having fun that is the way to defeat them obama says post-asad syria of islamist extremism
[01:50:20.700 --> 01:50:27.820]  is nightmare scenario obama in libya in syria i'm not saying qaddafi or or or or the guy in syria
[01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:32.460]  or the guy in syria are good guys but they weren't offensively doing anything they're putting real
[01:50:32.460 --> 01:50:37.100]  al-qaeda out of saudi arabia over there and are now talking about our troops having to go in
[01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:44.860]  after asad falls to fight them i mean what is going on with obama openly funding real al-qaeda
[01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:49.260]  i don't know if you've seen the videos of them chopping christians heads off in syria i can't
[01:50:49.260 --> 01:50:56.860]  even believe this it's like some outer limits or or some other dimension that that it's in the news
[01:50:56.860 --> 01:51:03.020]  obama warns syria could become enclave from extremism why is our government offensively
[01:51:03.020 --> 01:51:07.820]  with nato now saying nato is over our military our military's spoken out against us by the way
[01:51:07.820 --> 01:51:12.220]  i'm sure you know that what what is going on with that what are your do you hear anything from your
[01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:17.980]  military sources about about this craziness the 10 000 missiles from menghazi where they why did
[01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:22.780]  they kill the ambassador they stood down my inside sources that are in army intelligence say
[01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:27.820]  obama wanted him dead it was the menghazi security force that was al-qaeda that came
[01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:33.420]  over and killed him i mean it's just what is going on with obama i mean boy where do you
[01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:38.540]  begin to answer that question here's a guy that was born to communists raised by communists
[01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:46.220]  educated by communists preached to by america hating communists i mean who hasn't studied where
[01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:54.300]  this acorn chicago gangster scammer came from but that's what i was talking about the department of
[01:51:54.300 --> 01:51:59.100]  homeland security which by the way alex you're on the phone with the czar of homeland security
[01:51:59.100 --> 01:52:08.860]  homeland is secure know that but there's the the domestic agencies from the irs to the
[01:52:08.860 --> 01:52:16.380]  u.s fish and wildlife to the bureau of land management u.s forest service and dea and atf
[01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:23.660]  and fbi and it and remember a lot of those people i still think the majority of those agents are
[01:52:23.660 --> 01:52:30.300]  great patriots and great men and women and i i hang the future of america on the nail of truth that
[01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:35.980]  they have expressed to me that they will not enforce illegal anti-constitutional orders from
[01:52:35.980 --> 01:52:43.180]  above that is the great hope but that they're purchasing all this firepower and and armored
[01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:51.740]  vehicles who doesn't know this who doesn't identify this as an illegal act by the government
[01:52:51.740 --> 01:52:59.580]  who is so corrupt so out of control thank god for ted cruz and and ran paul and ron paul and
[01:52:59.580 --> 01:53:06.460]  and governor perry and rick and greg abbott and and and steve stockman and bill flores and and so
[01:53:06.460 --> 01:53:14.060]  many patriots that are standing up and and and and but that's that's the new gop that we the people
[01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:22.220]  have prodded with the we the people pulse when you extract the we the people pulse from politics
[01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:31.500]  you will get we the people i give you barack hussein obama i think they're gearing up
[01:53:32.620 --> 01:53:37.100]  what do you think's going on with the bullets are they trying to just dry up the the bullet supply
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:41.420]  well they certainly have succeeded that i started my own pet nugent line of ammo here last year and
[01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:45.900]  it's like everything else you find on the shelf nowadays if you can find any it's state-of-the-art
[01:53:45.900 --> 01:53:51.260]  stuff but we literally can't get my pallets of ammo off the truck people are buying them in the
[01:53:51.260 --> 01:53:56.540]  parking lot before they even get to the shelves which you know on a consumer side i'm i'm i'm
[01:53:56.540 --> 01:54:02.220]  gleeful of in the the ammo industry the firearms industry is literally having a consumer orgy like
[01:54:02.220 --> 01:54:07.660]  never before which is a very powerful statement from we the people that we smell what you're
[01:54:07.660 --> 01:54:14.540]  doing obama and we're gearing up too and a little don't tread on me reminder seems to be appropriate
[01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:20.220]  right now so there's no question what's going on the deceit the scam the criminality the
[01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:27.500]  bengazi the fast and furious sending f-16s to to egypt i mean you gotta be kidding me this
[01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:33.740]  this would make a stupid burns movie that alfred hitchcock wouldn't produce because it's too stupid
[01:54:33.740 --> 01:54:38.860]  but it's actually happening but that's what frustrates me that's why i got so sick i'm
[01:54:38.860 --> 01:54:43.580]  going to be honest i came in last night from work you know being an evil american i got home about
[01:54:43.580 --> 01:54:49.180]  nine and she said what is wrong with you and i just my kids all came up and they were around me
[01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:54.860]  and uh 10 down to age five and what's wrong dad and i just said i don't want to talk about it
[01:54:54.860 --> 01:55:02.220]  and then i couldn't i got so it was it was past anger it was the shame that we allow this scum
[01:55:02.220 --> 01:55:08.460]  to walk all over us and that and that and that this country has allowed pathetic filth and
[01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:12.540]  authoritarians to even call themselves liberal thomas jefferson was a liberal they're not
[01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:20.380]  liberals and it just made me reaffirm that i am going to redouble 110 percent and i'm coming after
[01:55:20.380 --> 01:55:27.100]  these people now what do you think about ways to go after legally and lawfully to go after uh
[01:55:27.100 --> 01:55:33.020]  carrie and all these globalists how do we really get aggressive boycott what do we do well you know
[01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:40.700]  i have such a if you can bear with me i literally have the answer the perfect answer
[01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:48.460]  ted cruz didn't sprout out of the ground and just show up i communicated with him texas who
[01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:54.620]  cared communicated with him with him we enthused him we supported him now he represents us and did
[01:55:54.620 --> 01:56:02.060]  you see the beauty the perfection of we the people when ted cruz that's right we backed him we backed
[01:56:02.060 --> 01:56:06.940]  him so we take over and that's what even the republican establishment is scared of real
[01:56:06.940 --> 01:56:13.420]  constitutional libertarian campaign for liberty people absolutely but that's why ted cruz so
[01:56:13.420 --> 01:56:19.820]  riled up feinstein because he represented the common sense pulse of logic freedom-loving
[01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:25.500]  americans and every state needs to do that and there's a lot of states that do do that arizona
[01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:32.540]  uh south dakota uh certainly texas is the master of it uh wisconsin has done great things with what
[01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:37.420]  they've done with scott walker up there and in his own way even though christie's only a solid
[01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:42.540]  two on the scale of ten he sure beats the negative eight of the past governors of that state in new
[01:56:42.540 --> 01:56:49.580]  jersey but we the people where we don't demand representation based on the constitution and our
[01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:55.580]  common sense where we don't demand it we will get the pelosis and the spines and the bloombergs
[01:56:55.580 --> 01:57:00.460]  and the kuomos and the subhuman freedom haters that are infesting this corrupt government right
[01:57:00.460 --> 01:57:08.380]  now so the answer is activism activism activism always always firm but never ever give up well
[01:57:08.380 --> 01:57:13.340]  here's an example drugsreport.com in the last year has been taking our stories and putting them out
[01:57:13.340 --> 01:57:18.220]  about the billion bullets the 1.6 the 2 billion the armored vehicles and they just said it didn't
[01:57:18.220 --> 01:57:24.060]  exist politico and other uh white house fronts now there's a 15-member congressional investigation
[01:57:24.060 --> 01:57:29.420]  starting uh congressman it's my duty to get to the bottom of massive dhs ammo buy it's now on

[02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:23.180]  it was 20 years ago sitting there in local community college every class whether it was
[02:00:23.180 --> 02:00:29.420]  trigonometry or psychology hearing how america was bad guns were bad george washington was a piece of
[02:00:29.420 --> 02:00:33.980]  garbage private property was evil and i said i got to get the media i wasn't even intending that
[02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:39.740]  went to an access show then six months into it got a local radio show then got a weeknight show
[02:00:39.740 --> 02:00:44.620]  then got syndicated and i've grown slowly but now we do reach 15 million people a week one way or
[02:00:44.620 --> 02:00:49.420]  another and it's growing it's quite frankly scary sometimes it's growing and it's growing and it's
[02:00:49.420 --> 02:00:53.580]  one way or another and it's growing it's quite frankly scary sometimes it's an incredible
[02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:59.020]  responsibility but the deeper you get into this fight it is not work folks my problem is i am
[02:00:59.020 --> 02:01:05.100]  completely obsessed with it because i'm being assaulted i'm angry and i have an instinct to
[02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:08.460]  it's like a fight if somebody starts a fight starts kicking your butt when you start kicking
[02:01:08.460 --> 02:01:11.900]  their butt back you know you want to go ahead and put them all the way down so they don't get back
[02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:18.220]  up i want to really get on the offense and really go after them and if everybody would join state
[02:01:18.220 --> 02:01:22.700]  and and national gun groups like the nra and others if everybody would go to their state
[02:01:22.700 --> 02:01:27.180]  houses and get aggressive we would route these people we're in fact ted nugent and closing you're
[02:01:27.180 --> 02:01:33.180]  talking about winning and also having fun don't you just think that that they've jumped the shark
[02:01:33.180 --> 02:01:38.620]  here and that if we double down we can actually have an offense that could really once and for all
[02:01:38.620 --> 02:01:44.220]  defeat the collectivist yeah it almost took in fact not almost it has taken this extreme attack
[02:01:44.220 --> 02:01:48.700]  on our individual freedoms by barack obama and all his gangster punk friends out there
[02:01:48.700 --> 02:01:53.420]  to wake a lot of americans up buying more firearms more ammo than ever in recorded history
[02:01:53.420 --> 02:01:57.900]  of planet earth that's a great sign but don't underestimate the importance i use the term
[02:01:57.900 --> 02:02:02.940]  cleanse my soul alex i get up in the tree with my bow and arrow i train with these heroes of
[02:02:02.940 --> 02:02:08.060]  the military that have sacrificed their arms and their legs we shoot machine guns from helicopters
[02:02:08.060 --> 02:02:13.340]  and kill hogs and we barbecue and we fish so never underestimate the importance of getting
[02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:17.180]  away from the battle as long as you've done the battle to the best of your ability and signed up
[02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:21.500]  new members of the nra gun owners of america you've communicated with your elected officials
[02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:26.540]  and you've kind of educated slash chastise your friends who are not engaged but then get out with
[02:02:26.540 --> 02:02:31.980]  your family invite some new shooters take that 22 with ears and eyes and hearing protection eye
[02:02:31.980 --> 02:02:37.500]  protection and introduce some new shooters i have a ted nugent camp for kids charity for 25 years
[02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:43.580]  and we've graduated over 15 000 young americans into the shooting sports for safe proper gun
[02:02:43.580 --> 02:02:50.380]  handling that drives the enemy that's how you blend your soul while you're winning the war
[02:02:50.380 --> 02:02:55.420]  having the time of your life now you're right we all need to fight hard and then play hard
[02:02:55.420 --> 02:03:01.900]  uh the black power tour uh in closing tell us tell us about that that really upset the system
[02:03:01.900 --> 02:03:05.980]  uh that your inspiration was black rock and rollers it also upsets him that charlton has
[02:03:05.980 --> 02:03:10.780]  done with such a humanitarian the civil rights movement well my all the good music in the world
[02:03:10.780 --> 02:03:14.940]  comes from black artists from the howlin wolf and muddy waters into boat diddly and chucks
[02:03:14.940 --> 02:03:19.500]  berry and little richard james brown and bullshit picket sam and dave and the motel and funk brothers
[02:03:19.500 --> 02:03:24.140]  so my incredible band the greatest rock and roll rhythm and blues band in the world
[02:03:24.140 --> 02:03:28.220]  greg smith and mick brown and derrick st holmes we're hitting the road this year starting next
[02:03:28.220 --> 02:03:32.700]  month with ariel and sticks and we're going out all summer before the hunting season starts
[02:03:32.700 --> 02:03:37.420]  but we're going to play a tribute as we always have for 50 years to those black american heroes
[02:03:37.420 --> 02:03:43.020]  that have inspired every piece of killer music in the history of mankind and it's called black power
[02:03:43.020 --> 02:03:47.820]  because the black artists showed us the way musically and emotionally in that spirit and
[02:03:47.820 --> 02:03:54.300]  uppity ferocity so we should take that and use it you can use stranglehold as the ultimate soundtrack
[02:03:54.300 --> 02:03:59.260]  for freedom and defiance and i want to thank everybody for making our spirit of the wild show
[02:03:59.260 --> 02:04:03.740]  the number one show on outdoor channel and our wanted dead or alive show the number one show on
[02:04:03.740 --> 02:04:08.140]  sportsman channel but i'm keeping at it i'm turning up the heat and we need to get more
[02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:13.020]  aggressive and meet to win this culture war asap well look at how you're all these hit shows on
[02:04:13.020 --> 02:04:17.180]  discovery that they're trying to cancel them even though they're hits because they know we're
[02:04:17.180 --> 02:04:22.540]  winning the culture war i see this whole attack as desperate flailing it is desperate flailing but
[02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:27.180]  that's going to backfire on jim carrey's going to backfire michael moore's backfiring i believe
[02:04:27.180 --> 02:04:32.940]  nancy you don't need to read this you need to sign it pelosi is a backfire in itself so we
[02:04:32.940 --> 02:04:39.020]  need to take advantage of the indecency the hate from the other side we need to express it always
[02:04:39.020 --> 02:04:44.700]  express it calmly if you're going to call your senator have a piece of paper with the main two

[02:08:10.060 --> 02:08:18.140]  oh it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[02:08:21.740 --> 02:08:25.580]  ladies and gentlemen curtain ml has an article out at info wars.com
[02:08:26.540 --> 02:08:33.100]  senators paul and cruise pledged defeat anti second amendment bill in the senate
[02:08:33.100 --> 02:08:39.420]  there's another report out by a slate in a salon i was actually surprised by it was halfway fair
[02:08:39.420 --> 02:08:44.860]  billy corrigan's strange infatuation with a conspiracy theorist the smashing pumpkin's
[02:08:44.860 --> 02:08:50.620]  front man reveals his admiration for alex jones the reason i mentioned that is it's a very good
[02:08:50.620 --> 02:08:55.580]  video and is reaching a lot of people that you would call liberal uh with the message of liberty
[02:08:55.580 --> 02:09:01.180]  because what we're trying to do is get past all the labels and obviously with somebody like uh
[02:09:01.180 --> 02:09:04.940]  ted nugent on you're going to get the labels against the democrats because he's chosen the
[02:09:04.940 --> 02:09:10.220]  republican team because he believes it's better you know to work from what's inside that and take
[02:09:10.220 --> 02:09:15.820]  it over and that's fine i say take over the democrats the republicans everybody a true liberal
[02:09:15.820 --> 02:09:24.140]  stance is pro-gun pro-private property pro-family pro live your own life and uh even though that's
[02:09:24.140 --> 02:09:29.820]  kind of a demonization headline little snot nose headline the actual article that we're going to
[02:09:29.820 --> 02:09:39.660]  actual article is very very fair and i've never seen that out of salon in the demonization pieces
[02:09:40.300 --> 02:09:46.860]  uh so again that's another positive sign right there here's another one you know you see carl
[02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:55.980]  rove coming out and demonizing campaign for liberty demonizing ran paul demonizing ted
[02:09:55.980 --> 02:10:00.780]  cruz saying oh you know they're not going to get anybody elected they're going to ruin the
[02:10:00.780 --> 02:10:06.380]  republican party and that's because they're scared to death of it they've tried to have
[02:10:06.380 --> 02:10:14.780]  the bilderbergs and peter thiel and others go in and take over the ron paul uh system
[02:10:15.500 --> 02:10:19.740]  and that certainly was successful with jesse benton at some levels because it's washington
[02:10:19.740 --> 02:10:25.180]  dc it's a barrel of sharks but if you look at ran paul and others they are the prototype
[02:10:25.180 --> 02:10:32.460]  of county commissioners city council people sheriffs state reps governors and other congress
[02:10:32.460 --> 02:10:38.940]  people like walter jones who is who who is a patriot and supporting the entire bill of rights
[02:10:38.940 --> 02:10:48.700]  and is against all these wars you see with ran paul with walter jones who is a convert to this
[02:10:48.700 --> 02:10:54.220]  in the last decade and apologizes for iraq and says he was lied to and repents i mean he's
[02:10:54.220 --> 02:11:00.220]  really repentant we're infiltrating them they're not infiltrating us and that's why they're coming
[02:11:00.220 --> 02:11:06.380]  after ran paul that's why they're coming after ted cruz and again i don't know ted cruz that
[02:11:06.380 --> 02:11:09.260]  well we've interviewed him before i don't completely trust him until i've known him a
[02:11:09.260 --> 02:11:15.660]  long time but the fruits on the tree shutting down diane feinstein not doing sophomoric half
[02:11:15.660 --> 02:11:24.060]  arguments but really bombshell you know crushing her we can take over there is this self-fulfilling
[02:11:24.060 --> 02:11:29.260]  prophecy that we can't win and that nobody can be good i mean i see this all the time
[02:11:29.260 --> 02:11:36.940]  where people can't believe that i'm actually real i didn't go to an access show for many years and
[02:11:36.940 --> 02:11:42.620]  get my own radio show and build it and start my website and you know even update it sometimes
[02:11:42.620 --> 02:11:47.980]  myself when i had almost no you know internet savvy uh on systems like coffee cup and then
[02:11:47.980 --> 02:11:55.100]  dreamweaver i didn't make films untrained with three-quarter inch tape and vhs i didn't sit
[02:11:55.100 --> 02:11:59.420]  there and cut my own audio tracks with a razor blade i didn't sneak into bohemian grove i didn't
[02:11:59.420 --> 02:12:04.540]  sneak into military operations i didn't go out and confront people i didn't go out and build a
[02:12:04.540 --> 02:12:14.620]  media system i didn't do any of that no there's an army of cia people out there in my control room
[02:12:14.620 --> 02:12:22.700]  they're running it all that's right you see because these are people out there who know
[02:12:22.700 --> 02:12:26.300]  the government's corrupt now they've gotten savvy enough to know they're serious problems
[02:12:26.300 --> 02:12:33.340]  in our society but they've been brought up by the television in their diapers you know 10 hours a
[02:12:33.340 --> 02:12:38.380]  day when they were little kids babies and brought up by the culture and they don't know how to do
[02:12:38.380 --> 02:12:42.380]  anything they don't even know how to work at mcdonald's they know how to go get you know their
[02:12:42.380 --> 02:12:46.700]  parents go pay their tuition to go to university to get a degree that won't exist by the time they
[02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:52.860]  get out we're going towards singularity the whole deal i mean it's obvious i mean this is this whole
[02:12:52.860 --> 02:12:58.860]  age is dying this whole system is going down this whole system is falling apart by design into the
[02:12:58.860 --> 02:13:04.700]  new technocracy it would already be major upheaval but the globalists are steering it to be as
[02:13:04.700 --> 02:13:11.260]  consolidated to consolidate and destroy society and it is just madness the globalist aren't going
[02:13:11.260 --> 02:13:16.300]  to get out of this in my deep research if they continue down this path it is madness it is
[02:13:16.300 --> 02:13:27.180]  nightmare it is joining with sauron it is joining with el diablo and people are such spectators
[02:13:27.180 --> 02:13:34.140]  they cannot imagine and that's why they don't want fighting that's why even wrestling or then
[02:13:34.140 --> 02:13:40.780]  running or dodgeball or then uh shaking hands is being made quote illegal they criminally charge
[02:13:40.780 --> 02:13:45.100]  you know there's not really a law they trick you to then plea bargain to a lesser charge and sign
[02:13:45.100 --> 02:13:48.780]  an agreement so it never goes to trial and then you get into the system that's why in the last
[02:13:48.780 --> 02:13:53.100]  15 years all over the world they're phasing it out because when you're growing up as a kid and
[02:13:53.100 --> 02:13:58.380]  get beat up by bullies it creates confidence when you finally learn to fight back when you
[02:13:58.380 --> 02:14:02.940]  paint things and go sell them and become successful it creates confidence when you go
[02:14:02.940 --> 02:14:09.740]  and work as a painter of houses and then go start your own business five years later and suddenly
[02:14:09.740 --> 02:14:15.100]  buy a new car and have a nice house it builds confidence soon you hire 10 more painters and
[02:14:15.100 --> 02:14:19.100]  you put up billboards and now you've got the biggest painting company in the town you know
[02:14:19.100 --> 02:14:25.260]  when you go out and mow the yards when when when you do go and become an engineer or a chemist and
[02:14:25.260 --> 02:14:29.740]  then go and develop things or when you invent something then it becomes you know successful
[02:14:29.740 --> 02:14:35.820]  then you invent hundreds of things they don't want you ever to have success and it just blows
[02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:42.460]  me away i mean the best thing that ever happened to me thank god i survived there was a few times
[02:14:42.460 --> 02:14:49.180]  i couldn't believe how rough dallas was i couldn't believe the total culture of maleness
[02:14:49.820 --> 02:14:54.220]  compared to austin now in a way it's kind of like after you've been in a big fight you want to go
[02:14:54.220 --> 02:14:58.140]  lay down that's what austin's like where there's hardly any fighting or you know it's just totally
[02:14:58.140 --> 02:15:03.820]  different culture but but in a way i realize that's because it is controlled but it's a
[02:15:03.820 --> 02:15:09.740]  side issue the best thing ever happened to me was people pulling knives on me uh getting stabbed
[02:15:10.540 --> 02:15:17.100]  getting in i think about how many fights i've been in uh all of it even though it was it was
[02:15:17.100 --> 02:15:24.620]  rough at the time it gave me confidence and experience and made me where i was confident
[02:15:24.620 --> 02:15:30.700]  in other things and probably too confident sometimes and i just and i'm not here saying
[02:15:30.700 --> 02:15:34.860]  i'm mr tough guy because let me tell you as tough as you think there are you know in any
[02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:38.700]  you know movie theater there's probably 10 guys can kick your butt there's a lot of tough guys
[02:15:38.700 --> 02:15:45.980]  out there but then i sit there and i see the morally weak and and and pathetic and emasculated
[02:15:45.980 --> 02:15:51.900]  who get into it who have never done anything on their own and will go work for a corporation
[02:15:51.900 --> 02:15:57.260]  pushing paper around waiting for the age of humans to end the globalists have decided the age of
[02:15:57.260 --> 02:16:02.460]  humans is over they believe their evolution is to merge with the machines and become gods now
[02:16:02.460 --> 02:16:06.860]  whether that's going to really happen or not the media always says i'm the one that believes that
[02:16:06.860 --> 02:16:12.380]  no the establishment believes it and i show in films and books and articles where they say it
[02:16:12.380 --> 02:16:18.060]  constantly they're they're out of control and i don't want them controlling my destiny i don't
[02:16:18.060 --> 02:16:23.500]  want them running my life and my children's life because i don't want my great-great-grandchildren
[02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:28.940]  to not exist i want passion and love and the challenge of life and the great adventure to
[02:16:28.940 --> 02:16:36.780]  continue i fear humanity's death i fear the stream to my ancestors from the past to the present to
[02:16:36.780 --> 02:16:42.780]  the future with my progeny and your progeny that will inherit the earth together being destroyed
[02:16:42.780 --> 02:16:48.060]  being damaged being twisted being abused i don't like thinking about innocent people being abused
[02:16:48.060 --> 02:16:59.180]  are pulled down i don't like what's happening and i want to defeat the tyranny and you have to first
[02:16:59.180 --> 02:17:02.860]  believe you can defeat it and the churches of all taught it's the end of the world and there's no
[02:17:02.860 --> 02:17:07.340]  reason to get involved just just leave the world alone and that's why evil's taking over whether
[02:17:07.340 --> 02:17:12.460]  it is the end of the world or not coming you have a job you're just gonna let people be caught up by
[02:17:12.460 --> 02:17:18.460]  the world system you're just gonna let people be overrun by this most of you don't fight this
[02:17:18.460 --> 02:17:28.540]  tyranny because you're cowards and and and it is so pathetic it is so absolutely
[02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:39.500]  completely pathetic at so many levels you're allowing the evil to take over that's the danger
[02:17:39.500 --> 02:17:45.740]  you should be afraid of acting like a sheep bringing in the wolves your wolf bait but
[02:17:45.740 --> 02:17:52.060]  instead you think it will protect you groveling under the dark wings of the new world order it
[02:17:52.060 --> 02:17:58.140]  will not do that and you have a responsibility to speak out against this but you know you're
[02:17:58.140 --> 02:18:02.860]  afraid of what your neighbors think much less the government coming after you you i mean i can't
[02:18:02.860 --> 02:18:08.460]  believe how people care what others think or someone laughing at someone who you don't know
[02:18:08.460 --> 02:18:11.660]  i mean if i know somebody and they're trying to do something to me i take it personal and then
[02:18:11.660 --> 02:18:16.380]  don't like it but if i don't know somebody you're laughing at me i mean if i slip and fall at a
[02:18:16.380 --> 02:18:19.980]  grocery store or something everybody's pointing and laughing i'm not embarrassed i get up make
[02:18:19.980 --> 02:18:27.900]  a joke and i just don't understand the unconfident patheticness that pete the spirit of patheticness

[02:24:55.500 --> 02:25:04.780]  enemies chris in connecticut you're on the air go ahead welcome hey i just wanted to address a
[02:25:04.780 --> 02:25:13.100]  specific remark that mr nugent had made and that remark was about that unfortunate poor marine who
[02:25:13.100 --> 02:25:20.140]  died with a rocket in his chest and how he died over there in iraq defending the constitution
[02:25:20.940 --> 02:25:28.460]  and our freedoms and you know that didn't make me want to vomit and i'm sure to most people
[02:25:28.460 --> 02:25:33.340]  listening in yourself you realize that that's just simply not true that the constitution calls
[02:25:33.340 --> 02:25:38.940]  sure his whole point is his whole point is is that they swear an oath to it and that that guy died
[02:25:38.940 --> 02:25:42.860]  and so when you're over there you end up hating the people that you're fighting against and so
[02:25:42.860 --> 02:25:47.340]  i brought up why is our government funding the radical muslims to bring everybody down
[02:25:47.340 --> 02:25:52.540]  it's a sophisticated thing to understand but they're starting to get it you see that's what
[02:25:52.540 --> 02:25:58.540]  i'm doing by exposing that the that the globalists run al-qaeda is that will bring down the whole
[02:25:58.540 --> 02:26:06.060]  fake war on terror uh and so that's why yeah go ahead sir your phone's a little breaking up go

[02:26:51.980 --> 02:26:58.220]  henry speech is um just so apropos to what's going on today they're they're gathering armies
[02:26:58.220 --> 02:27:03.100]  against us they want to confiscate our guns the war has already begun why stand we here idle
[02:27:03.100 --> 02:27:11.100]  absolutely there's there's no time for ceremony um you know there's there's so much going on these
[02:27:11.100 --> 02:27:15.820]  guys are criminals they're afraid because we're exposing them they're trying to do everything they
[02:27:15.820 --> 02:27:22.620]  can to save their hive uh i believe a false flag is imminent to distract everybody from from how
[02:27:22.620 --> 02:27:28.540]  much we're exposing them um and and billy uh billy cordon had a great idea i'm bringing other uh
[02:27:28.540 --> 02:27:35.100]  other disciplines in here you know satan is a is the the the narcissist and our society and
[02:27:35.100 --> 02:27:40.700]  particularly jim carrey and all these others like him they're narcissists and there's a wonderful
[02:27:40.700 --> 02:27:47.180]  woman melanie tony evans that has a wonderful uh piece of work on narcissism and and then a couple
[02:27:47.180 --> 02:27:53.100]  other things on solutions is uh i think we should because everybody's tight on money we should we
[02:27:53.100 --> 02:27:58.060]  should make a 10 million man march and everybody gather and go to their state houses so they don't
[02:27:58.060 --> 02:28:03.180]  always have to spend a lot of money and go to washington but they're state houses and uh and
[02:28:03.180 --> 02:28:10.380]  then one last thing um these uh these huge armored vehicles they they have a serious weakness that
[02:28:10.380 --> 02:28:17.580]  their windows if uh everybody has paintball guns and wrist rockets to shoot paint uh that that
[02:28:17.580 --> 02:28:27.180]  that makes them like a turtle you're tipped over where'd you do that research i just looked at them
[02:28:27.180 --> 02:28:31.900]  looked at them and looked for their weaknesses and and uh you know they don't have a lot of
[02:28:31.900 --> 02:28:38.460]  weaknesses uh with small arms fire but their windows you know if they can't see they can't
[02:28:38.460 --> 02:28:45.020]  drive and paintball guns are inexpensive balloons and wrist rockets and paint oil-based paint is
[02:28:45.020 --> 02:28:50.060]  inexpensive sure well even if there's cameras on them you can take those out now we need to take
[02:28:50.060 --> 02:28:56.060]  them out politically and expose this arms buildup against us and then it's checkmate you understand
[02:28:56.060 --> 02:29:02.940]  the propaganda value people think propaganda is a bad word there's white propaganda gray propaganda

[02:33:15.020 --> 02:33:23.020]  if i could have gotten 51 votes in the senate of the united states for an outright ban
[02:33:23.020 --> 02:33:29.020]  picking up every one of them mr and mrs america turn them all in i would have done it
[02:33:31.020 --> 02:33:37.020]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[02:33:37.020 --> 02:33:41.980]  all right let's continue with your phone calls after that bombshell interview with ted nugent
[02:33:41.980 --> 02:33:46.940]  in defense of the second amendment because if they get the guns everything else implodes they
[02:33:46.940 --> 02:33:52.220]  want to take your bank accounts i've told you that for over a decade they've done the same thing in
[02:33:52.220 --> 02:33:59.900]  country after country after country after country after country and only realizing that if you
[02:33:59.900 --> 02:34:07.340]  country after country after country after country after country and only realizing that both
[02:34:07.340 --> 02:34:12.860]  political parties and all three major political parties in england and and the same thing in
[02:34:12.860 --> 02:34:19.100]  parliaments of europe they get in there and they control the parties and have almost no difference
[02:34:19.100 --> 02:34:24.380]  between them as carol quigley wrote in the book tragedy and hope so we can either create new
[02:34:24.380 --> 02:34:28.940]  parties or we can take over the states or we can take over the republican and democratic parties
[02:34:28.940 --> 02:34:36.140]  and like billy corrigan talked about there has got to be some way to bridge the gap and get people
[02:34:36.140 --> 02:34:41.900]  that are part of the power structure to realize you aren't totally evil that we're going downhill
[02:34:41.900 --> 02:34:48.780]  fast and you can't just keep looting in all directions that's why i have tried so desperately
[02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:53.660]  to you know have different people from different perspectives on in fact i've even meant to get to
[02:34:53.660 --> 02:34:57.740]  it now i said i'm taking calls we've got the jim hightower interview from the nightly news
[02:34:57.740 --> 02:35:03.580]  was like 40 minutes long it's 18 minute uh excerpts where you know he they contacted us
[02:35:03.580 --> 02:35:06.780]  wanted to come on i tried to get him in here to convince him about the second amendment
[02:35:06.780 --> 02:35:11.660]  but he wasn't like making fun of charlton heston and people and you know wasn't just being
[02:35:11.660 --> 02:35:16.220]  completely nasty and i understand that i get nasty sometimes too you know calling michael
[02:35:16.220 --> 02:35:19.740]  more disgusting and evil because watching him use the dead kids and saying let's show their
[02:35:19.740 --> 02:35:24.780]  dead photos and let's destroy the second amendment and all this stuff i mean it really makes me angry
[02:35:24.780 --> 02:35:29.340]  because they know what they're doing and there's a very good chance that sandy hook has some staging
[02:35:29.340 --> 02:35:35.660]  provocateuring there's no doubt on uh aurora there's just no doubt that is a mind control
[02:35:35.660 --> 02:35:46.700]  operation out in the open that is a mind control operation out in the open and it is just off the
[02:35:46.700 --> 02:35:51.420]  charts disgusting in fact you guys do have the jim hightower interview don't you
[02:35:51.420 --> 02:35:51.920]  thank you
[02:35:54.780 --> 02:36:01.740]  really i mean i had a meeting with rob this morning about it uh all right well it's not
[02:36:01.740 --> 02:36:07.980]  a big deal well it's a good thing i was just gonna take calls then uh let's uh who knows
[02:36:07.980 --> 02:36:13.820]  maybe we'll air it in overdrive or something like that uh let's go ahead and talk to wild man in
[02:36:13.820 --> 02:36:20.940]  texas wild man you're on the air go ahead hey alex uh kudos to you and your crew you got a lot of
[02:36:20.940 --> 02:36:27.740]  talented people there uh you're truly at the tip of the spear i uh just wanted to comment on the
[02:36:27.740 --> 02:36:35.260]  jim carrey uh video uh i i normally like jim carrey uh i thought he was a pretty funny guy
[02:36:35.260 --> 02:36:41.420]  uh the deal is that when i looked at that i couldn't believe what i was seeing um i tried
[02:36:41.420 --> 02:36:46.220]  to put myself in his mindset and understand where he was coming from as an american
[02:36:46.220 --> 02:36:53.820]  and i i don't think he truly understands uh how dangerous government is and and all of that
[02:36:53.820 --> 02:37:01.180]  i think that the comedy fell flat i certainly fell flat with me um it actually made me
[02:37:01.180 --> 02:37:07.740]  i'll never see a jim carrey movie again in my life i will there he's actually the jane fonda
[02:37:09.100 --> 02:37:15.180]  of of this this campaign here you might say well i mean we know the establishment right wing is
[02:37:15.180 --> 02:37:20.540]  authoritarian and power grabbing it's that the left runs around saying they're these wonderful
[02:37:20.540 --> 02:37:26.700]  people and they're a bunch of nasty crazy people and and i'm just sick of them i'm absolutely tired
[02:37:26.700 --> 02:37:34.860]  of it yeah i i'd like to go off in another direction i think one of you you know you have a
[02:37:34.860 --> 02:37:41.180]  great platform there you have a lot of talented people um i'd like you to reflect on what worked
[02:37:41.180 --> 02:37:47.740]  and uh you know during the vietnam war uh there was a there was a program called laughing with
[02:37:47.740 --> 02:37:55.340]  goldie han and a lot of great comedians and that the satire was great i think that would be the
[02:37:55.340 --> 02:38:02.700]  most effective if you if you were to do something like that that would be a very effective weapon
[02:38:02.700 --> 02:38:11.980]  that would probably um get other people you know non uh uh non-evil people within the uh
[02:38:11.980 --> 02:38:17.660]  administration or the hall of power to kind of listen to you and and that sort of thing
[02:38:17.660 --> 02:38:21.020]  comedy is your best weapon and that's all i gotta say
[02:38:24.460 --> 02:38:29.660]  no i hear you i hear you and it just it just somehow made me sick because it was so bizarro
[02:38:29.660 --> 02:38:37.180]  it was so incredibly strange um yeah to you know to see that and and you know to just see all the
[02:38:37.180 --> 02:38:43.980]  weird weird enjoyment of it uh it's it's just crazy i mean charlton heston doesn't deserve
[02:38:43.980 --> 02:38:48.780]  to be treated like that and if it was even like jokes about him showing him like a crazy guy
[02:38:48.780 --> 02:38:54.780]  shooting guns would be one thing but he's going to hell and he's a bad guy and he's a piece of
[02:38:54.780 --> 02:38:59.740]  piece of garbage and all the rest of it and the dead kids are his fault and you know they're
[02:38:59.740 --> 02:39:04.940]  saying it's our fault i mean they've said it's gun owners fault so i need to be killed according to
[02:39:04.940 --> 02:39:09.340]  buzz bissinger who spends six hundred thousand dollars on women's clothes you know again and
[02:39:09.340 --> 02:39:12.060]  people like oh you don't like people wearing women's clothes it's just like what what is
[02:39:12.060 --> 02:39:15.820]  the point of that i mean go go give it to homeless kids i mean let me tell you something
[02:39:17.340 --> 02:39:20.620]  i mean i'm embarrassed sometimes when i buy like a hundred dollar shirt or a
[02:39:20.620 --> 02:39:25.420]  three hundred dollar jacket you know i i'm not even saying it's bad to own things it's just
[02:39:25.420 --> 02:39:30.380]  that like the it's it's just weird it's like a meldo marcos with you know three thousand pairs
[02:39:30.380 --> 02:39:35.020]  of shoes i don't know i guess i got five six pairs of boots it's just it's just it's something weird
[02:39:35.020 --> 02:39:39.980]  about them because they're they're all like fat off the hog of the system while lecturing us all
[02:39:39.980 --> 02:39:44.060]  day we need to pay more taxes i mean that michael morclabree goes there's these white people that
[02:39:44.060 --> 02:39:48.940]  make fifty sixty thousand dollars a year and they live in the countryside and they don't like black
[02:39:48.940 --> 02:39:54.860]  peoples why they've got guns they're scared wipe what now you know they've got lots of money and
[02:39:54.860 --> 02:40:00.220]  so they i mean it's like a class warfare against people making sixty thousand dollars a year it's
[02:40:00.220 --> 02:40:04.940]  now an evil rich guy by some guy worth i don't know some estimates a hundred million dollars
[02:40:04.940 --> 02:40:10.220]  some are fifty million dollars i mean it's just it's screwed up man they're hypocrites
[02:40:10.220 --> 02:40:16.700]  i appreciate your call that's what gets to me let's talk to joe in california you're on the air
[02:40:16.700 --> 02:40:24.140]  uh listening on kscl 1340 am go ahead hey alex uh my quick question was um you probably heard it
[02:40:24.140 --> 02:40:29.340]  before but why don't you take your movies to the big screens of the big cities and if it's a money
[02:40:29.340 --> 02:40:34.620]  issue why don't you start a fund on the prison planet where we can donate whatever we can to
[02:40:34.620 --> 02:40:40.300]  help fund that i'd love to go to speaking engagements my issue is i have to be here to
[02:40:40.300 --> 02:40:46.540]  crank out the news do the research and try to build the tv end of this operation um i i mean
[02:40:46.540 --> 02:40:51.980]  it's just i've got like over a hundred reports i want to do more than a hundred and and i've
[02:40:51.980 --> 02:40:57.820]  got them in lists and folders and like where are my little notebooks there they are of just it's
[02:40:57.820 --> 02:41:04.460]  total frustration and i'm really listening to what ted nugent was saying about rnr uh but uh i would
[02:41:04.460 --> 02:41:08.780]  love it would be great to show thousands coming out all over the country it would be great to
[02:41:08.780 --> 02:41:14.460]  show that to the media but the establishment media already knows we're big uh you know and and again
[02:41:14.460 --> 02:41:20.300]  it's grueling to fly through the tsa or driving an old bus we've got it's a nice bus it's like 12
[02:41:20.300 --> 02:41:24.380]  years old it's like the space shuttle it has i've got a good deal on it because it's impossible to
[02:41:24.380 --> 02:41:28.860]  upkeep so i didn't really get a good deal on it it's an okay deal it's just that uh you know the
[02:41:28.860 --> 02:41:33.900]  point is uh actually it wasn't the best deal i could get i mean comparable things were like
[02:41:33.900 --> 02:41:37.580]  twice as much we got a really good deal on it still has some maintenance and things as it's
[02:41:37.580 --> 02:41:43.580]  custom but it's just i just don't have it in me uh and and i also like it once i go on the road but
[02:41:43.580 --> 02:41:48.140]  it's also very stressful plus i'm trying to train and build a crew so that it's not just you know
[02:41:48.140 --> 02:41:53.500]  alex jones out here doing this you see what i'm saying i do and also hey you know i hear you're
[02:41:53.500 --> 02:41:57.660]  saying you have that bus issues and the maintenance takes a lot of money but you're helping us so much
[02:41:57.660 --> 02:42:03.900]  all the listeners you should uh rely on us to help you out well i mean i'm i mean i drive i've got
[02:42:03.900 --> 02:42:07.980]  i've got a decent you know ford truck and uh and i'm you know a nice house out in the country and
[02:42:07.980 --> 02:42:12.380]  everything and i'm trying to put pretty much this year i'm trying to take every bit of money i get
[02:42:12.380 --> 02:42:17.180]  and put it every bit of it into the fight that's why we're talking about you know putting out a
[02:42:17.180 --> 02:42:21.020]  million bumper stickers i mean i really want to give the globalist a run for their money
[02:42:21.020 --> 02:42:28.060]  what i'm looking for what's at the top of my hierarchy of needs uh you know they have a chart
[02:42:28.060 --> 02:42:33.820]  of hierarchy of needs is liberty and freedom and and and and reigniting individualism because if
[02:42:33.820 --> 02:42:38.700]  we become individualist again and if we're not pushovers again and if we stand up for ourselves
[02:42:38.700 --> 02:42:45.260]  then we can really build an incredible future uh together and so that's what i'm attempting to do
[02:42:45.260 --> 02:42:48.700]  i appreciate your call joe hey thank you thank you
[02:42:53.100 --> 02:42:56.540]  i'm gonna play a little bit of high tower and then maybe play some more of it in overdrive
[02:42:56.540 --> 02:42:59.180]  come back in the next segment and take calls but let's go ahead and go to some of the jim
[02:42:59.180 --> 02:43:04.060]  hightower interview from info wars uh nightly news that rob jacobson put together here it is
[02:43:04.060 --> 02:43:06.700]  and then we will look i'll go right come back
[02:43:08.140 --> 02:43:11.900]  i got a chance to meet him years ago going on his radio show and run into him around austin
[02:43:11.900 --> 02:43:15.740]  and anybody who lives in texas knows who he is where people that watch national news know him
[02:43:15.740 --> 02:43:21.820]  as well he's a best-selling author uh he is uh known as the road warriors he travels he gives
[02:43:21.820 --> 02:43:28.060]  over 100 speeches a year he was twice elected texas agriculture uh commissioner as the
[02:43:28.060 --> 02:43:34.860]  well and that's only the tip of the iceberg i mean he really has an amazing bio jim hightower
[02:43:34.860 --> 02:43:38.780]  here in studio on the nightly news then of course we're also going to air some excerpts of this
[02:43:38.780 --> 02:43:43.340]  on the syndicated radio show great to have you sir to be with you thank you i get the fact that
[02:43:43.340 --> 02:43:48.780]  america has been a swashbuckling violent culture uh and and that guns are part of our culture
[02:43:49.340 --> 02:43:54.700]  and i also understand the fact that uh we're in a situation where we're in a situation where we're
[02:43:54.700 --> 02:43:59.500]  in a situation where we're in a situation of violent culture and i also understand the fact
[02:43:59.500 --> 02:44:04.300]  that overall violent crime has dropped 49 in the last 20 years because gun ownership
[02:44:04.300 --> 02:44:07.660]  has gone way up they also said we took lead out of things people aren't as violent i think that
[02:44:07.660 --> 02:44:12.920]  feeds into it you know as well the whole lead effect but this litmus test to you know to say
[02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:16.700]  let's restrict guns the reason blunberg has no credibility is he's speaking from a place
[02:44:16.700 --> 02:44:21.180]  that's a total abolition on guns same thing with chicago where they've taken all the guns and
[02:44:21.180 --> 02:44:25.820]  you to take three or four minutes out, where you stand on that because here's the issue.
[02:44:25.820 --> 02:44:30.740]  I can get people arguing, come on, let's not have crazy people get guns. But really, it's
[02:44:30.740 --> 02:44:35.660]  a way to register mine and take them, which has happened everywhere else. We know that
[02:44:35.660 --> 02:44:39.660]  the authoritarian bent of government while it arms to the teeth is to take our guns.
[02:44:39.660 --> 02:44:44.100]  And that's why all the even progressives, the old time liberals, true populists, not
[02:44:44.100 --> 02:44:48.740]  the fake progressives, they're all out getting guns. Jim Hightower, where do you stand on
[02:44:48.740 --> 02:44:54.740]  the Second Amendment and has Obama and Dianne Feinstein jump the shark going after the Second
[02:44:54.740 --> 02:44:55.740]  Amendment?
[02:44:55.740 --> 02:45:05.540]  Well, I don't think Feinstein, well, I'm not sure, but forget them. I believe in the Second
[02:45:05.540 --> 02:45:11.540]  Amendment. I've been a hunter, I'm not now, for reasons to having nothing to do with guns,
[02:45:11.540 --> 02:45:19.820]  but just not a hunter. And I believe in self defense. I don't believe in assault weapons
[02:45:19.820 --> 02:45:23.660]  in the home. I don't see any need for that. And I think the Second Amendment people are
[02:45:23.660 --> 02:45:29.420]  hurting themselves by maintaining that. It's just too far beyond what is necessary.
[02:45:29.420 --> 02:45:31.900]  Well, how do we trust the state with it?
[02:45:31.900 --> 02:45:33.660]  Well, trust the state, that's not-
[02:45:33.660 --> 02:45:34.660]  See, if they weren't-
[02:45:34.660 --> 02:45:35.660]  You can't trust the state.
[02:45:35.660 --> 02:45:37.740]  If the government wasn't escalating its armament-
[02:45:37.740 --> 02:45:38.740]  Yeah.
[02:45:38.740 --> 02:45:42.780]  ... to the Second Amendment argument that it was for tyranny, do you see, as they escalate,
[02:45:42.780 --> 02:45:43.780]  we have to escalate.
[02:45:43.780 --> 02:45:46.460]  Yeah, the 1.6 billion bullets, Homeland Security bullets.
[02:45:46.460 --> 02:45:49.780]  Which they tried to deny. Isn't that even crazier? No, go ahead and make your point,
[02:45:49.780 --> 02:45:50.780]  I'll shut up. Go ahead.
[02:45:50.780 --> 02:45:56.180]  Well, they tried to deny and then they said, well, it's because you can get a better deal.
[02:45:56.180 --> 02:45:57.660]  1.6 billion bullets.
[02:45:57.660 --> 02:45:59.300]  Yeah, so see why we need the guns?
[02:45:59.300 --> 02:46:00.300]  Yeah, right.
[02:46:00.300 --> 02:46:01.300]  Go ahead.
[02:46:01.300 --> 02:46:06.380]  Yeah, so you don't trust the government. You don't trust corporations. You don't trust
[02:46:06.380 --> 02:46:10.460]  power anywhere except as diffuse as you can possibly make it.
[02:46:10.460 --> 02:46:12.420]  So in that argument for semi-autos?
[02:46:12.420 --> 02:46:17.020]  No, no, I think that's too much. But-
[02:46:17.020 --> 02:46:18.580]  Why do you think that?
[02:46:18.580 --> 02:46:27.220]  Because semi-automatic weapons, you don't need it for defense. I don't know if you've
[02:46:27.220 --> 02:46:31.660]  seen any of what those bullets do. They just show any, of course, of those things.
[02:46:31.660 --> 02:46:34.980]  They break up and things. But what about when, what about people are using them against criminals,
[02:46:34.980 --> 02:46:37.700]  have them against you? Don't you need to be able to meet that force?
[02:46:37.700 --> 02:46:40.460]  I think there's a lot of ways to do that and I don't think that-
[02:46:40.460 --> 02:46:44.660]  Well, Jim, I respect the work you've done and I think you're a trailblazer. And Ford,
[02:46:44.660 --> 02:46:48.220]  what you call populist liberals, I think you're about as good as it gets and I like you. And
[02:46:48.220 --> 02:46:51.540]  I like a lot of your commentaries, I follow them, but I gotta be honest. It's a litmus
[02:46:51.540 --> 02:46:54.980]  test for the Democratic Party to be anti-gun.
[02:46:54.980 --> 02:46:59.780]  And I think deep down, you know full well that it's about the individual. We can't collectively
[02:46:59.780 --> 02:47:03.340]  say everybody can't have these type of guns because people might do something wrong with
[02:47:03.340 --> 02:47:04.340]  them.
[02:47:04.340 --> 02:47:10.500]  Well, again, I'm not against having guns at all. I mean, I'm for the Second Amendment,
[02:47:10.500 --> 02:47:18.340]  but I think the Second Amendment Crusade hurts itself by defending these use of these assault
[02:47:18.340 --> 02:47:21.620]  weapons. I don't think they ought to be-
[02:47:21.620 --> 02:47:26.340]  Lanza at Sandy Hook reportedly, he tried five times to get guns and then stole them from
[02:47:26.340 --> 02:47:27.340]  his mother.
[02:47:27.340 --> 02:47:28.340]  Yeah.
[02:47:28.340 --> 02:47:29.340]  I mean, you're not gonna, all these-
[02:47:29.340 --> 02:47:30.340]  No, I agree.
[02:47:30.340 --> 02:47:31.340]  So then how does all this new stuff-
[02:47:31.340 --> 02:47:32.780]  You're not gonna stop the crazy people either.
[02:47:32.780 --> 02:47:37.460]  Well, what if Adam Lanza's coming and he's got an AR-15, an M4, don't I need one to take
[02:47:37.460 --> 02:47:39.460]  him out? I mean-
[02:47:39.460 --> 02:47:43.260]  Well, you need luck, or you need somebody else who's gonna do something.
[02:47:43.260 --> 02:47:46.020]  Trust in God, but we're away from the rocks now.
[02:47:46.020 --> 02:47:52.820]  Right, yeah, I mean, yeah. I don't know. To me, the central issue facing us is that too
[02:47:52.820 --> 02:47:56.300]  few people have too much of the money and power, and they're using that against the
[02:47:56.300 --> 02:47:57.300]  rest of us.
[02:47:57.300 --> 02:48:02.760]  But Jim, worldwide, worldwide, the same corporations that are conquering America have taken every
[02:48:02.760 --> 02:48:06.860]  body's guns. And they always say, be reasonable, give us semi-autos. And the nice guys like
[02:48:06.860 --> 02:48:10.540]  you who are like, don't wanna hurt a fly, don't wanna hunt, cuz you don't wanna kill
[02:48:10.540 --> 02:48:15.220]  Bambi. It's funny, the older I get, the less I wanna hunt. I get all that, but see, that's
[02:48:15.220 --> 02:48:16.500]  not where it's coming from.
[02:48:16.500 --> 02:48:20.460]  They're buying full auto, they're buying tanks, they're doing all this. And our founders said,
[02:48:20.460 --> 02:48:23.800]  you've got whatever the infantry weapon is to protect yourself. Are you worried about
[02:48:23.800 --> 02:48:27.120]  a civil war in this country?
[02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:34.620]  Not yet, but again, people are being knocked down so hard and being told that it's the
[02:48:34.620 --> 02:48:38.260]  new normal, that you've got to learn to live with this. You're not gonna be middle class,
[02:48:38.260 --> 02:48:43.600]  your kids are not gonna be middle class, that there will be a rebellion over that. And that's
[02:48:43.600 --> 02:48:48.580]  not a war with bullets and guns, that is a war with economic power.
[02:48:48.580 --> 02:48:53.000]  I agree, that's where the real power is. And the First Amendment's even more powerful.
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:56.380]  We need to use that so we don't get to the second. We have the cartridge box, the grand
[02:48:56.380 --> 02:48:59.940]  jury box, the jury box, the voting box. But we do have the cartridge box, and that's why
[02:48:59.940 --> 02:49:02.420]  the founders put it there. I don't want it to go there, believe me.
[02:49:02.420 --> 02:49:07.660]  The beauty of the drone issue is it's crossing all the lines. Cuz Ron Wyden, a Democrat from
[02:49:07.660 --> 02:49:08.860]  Oregon, was standing up there-
[02:49:08.860 --> 02:49:10.140]  They're now questioning Obama.
[02:49:10.140 --> 02:49:16.140]  Yeah, well, of course. And the Democratic caucus has written a pretty scathing letter
[02:49:16.140 --> 02:49:20.220]  to the Obama administration, saying, you really need to tell us a whole lot more about these
[02:49:20.220 --> 02:49:24.700]  things and what your plans are. Because people are getting alarmed, because now we're learning
[02:49:24.700 --> 02:49:29.940]  that police agencies at all levels are wanting to get ahold of these little things. The New
[02:49:29.940 --> 02:49:32.900]  York Times called them Orwellian gnats.
[02:49:32.900 --> 02:49:33.900]  Yeah.
[02:49:33.900 --> 02:49:39.540]  Because they're talking about not a few, they're talking about 30,000 of them by 2020 in our
[02:49:39.540 --> 02:49:44.460]  airspace. Now, this worries airline pilots, cuz how do we control these things? It worries
[02:49:44.460 --> 02:49:49.260]  the FAA, it worries all kinds of civil liberties people, right and left.
[02:49:49.260 --> 02:49:52.860]  Did you see the Department of Defense video, if not, we'll show a short clip of it, where
[02:49:52.860 --> 02:49:57.580]  a drone flies over and drops out hundreds of little ones that land on the wire at your
[02:49:57.580 --> 02:49:58.580]  house and watch you?
[02:49:58.580 --> 02:50:02.940]  Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's what we're talking about. And they have another one called Swarm,
[02:50:02.940 --> 02:50:08.180]  and it's a series of drones that can keep track of large amounts of people. So they're
[02:50:08.180 --> 02:50:09.180]  certainly gonna be used in demonstrations.
[02:50:09.180 --> 02:50:13.580]  I'll tell you what, let's show a short clip of that.
[02:50:13.580 --> 02:50:20.340]  Micro air vehicles, or MAVs, will play an important role in future warfare. MAVs will
[02:50:20.340 --> 02:50:25.780]  be integrated into future Air Force layered sensing systems. These systems may be air
[02:50:25.780 --> 02:50:39.420]  dropped or hand launched, depending on the mission requirements.
[02:50:39.420 --> 02:50:45.840]  Multiple MAVs, each equipped with small sensors, will work together to survey a large area.
[02:50:45.840 --> 02:50:51.100]  Information from these sensors will be combined, providing the swarm of MAVs with a big picture
[02:50:51.100 --> 02:50:58.060]  point of view. Data will be communicated amongst the MAVs to enable real-time, reliable decision
[02:50:58.060 --> 02:50:59.060]  making.
[02:50:59.060 --> 02:51:05.620]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water

[02:52:00.660 --> 02:52:04.820]  Do you suffer from low functioning adrenal or thyroid gland? Did you know that mercury
[02:52:04.820 --> 02:52:09.040]  from your dental fillings comes off your teeth both as a vapor and as metal particles into
[02:52:09.040 --> 02:52:13.720]  your body? Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from functioning normally.
[02:52:13.720 --> 02:52:18.700]  Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60%. Mercury deposited
[02:52:18.700 --> 02:52:22.460]  into your adrenals or thyroid will cause a corresponding drop in function. The number
[02:52:22.460 --> 02:52:26.640]  one method by which your body detoxifies itself of mercury is glutathione. The number one
[02:52:26.640 --> 02:52:32.040]  superfood that helps turn on all 75 trillion cells in your body to produce glutathione
[02:52:32.040 --> 02:52:37.580]  is non-denatured whey protein from grass-fed cows. After investigating most high-end whey
[02:52:37.580 --> 02:52:42.700]  proteins on the market, only one is the most non-denatured, the most active, the most complete,
[02:52:42.700 --> 02:52:46.820]  and in our opinion, the most powerful, in what nature originally put into the fresh
[02:52:46.820 --> 02:52:58.020]  raw whey. It is One World Whey. Call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325. Or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[02:52:58.020 --> 02:53:04.440]  That's OneWorldW-H-E-Y.com. We've lived in this neighborhood for years. We have an alarm
[02:53:04.440 --> 02:53:09.240]  system and all of our doors have deadbolts. They kicked in our door and were in and out
[02:53:09.240 --> 02:53:13.680]  of our house in about five minutes. The police arrived in about 20 minutes, but they were
[02:53:13.680 --> 02:53:19.320]  long gone with our TV, jewelry, and my guns. I kept thinking, what if my family had been
[02:53:19.320 --> 02:53:24.840]  home? The police officer said that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door and that
[02:53:24.840 --> 02:53:30.320]  deadbolts alone don't stop intruders. The officer told me to go to EasyArmor.net if
[02:53:30.320 --> 02:53:35.460]  we wanted something that would actually stop an intruder. EasyArmor reinforces all of the
[02:53:35.460 --> 02:53:40.380]  weak points on your doors and is guaranteed to prevent kick-ins. I was surprised at how
[02:53:40.380 --> 02:53:47.300]  little EasyArmor costs and I installed EasyArmor in about 30 minutes. Visit EasyArmor.net.
[02:53:47.300 --> 02:53:56.740]  That's the letters E-Z-A-R-M-O-R.net. Or call 888-58-ARMER. That's 888-582-7667. EasyArmor.net.
[02:53:56.740 --> 02:54:04.820]  Ultimate door security made easy. The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly
[02:54:04.820 --> 02:54:13.260]  presents the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind. All right, let's try
[02:54:13.260 --> 02:54:16.440]  to run through a bunch of your phone calls. We're going to do a fourth hour of overdrive
[02:54:16.440 --> 02:54:23.580]  today that some stations do carry and is in the internet streams at mfullwars.com. Richard
[02:54:23.580 --> 02:54:26.780]  Reeves is going to be in here talking about mfullwarshealth.com and some really important
[02:54:26.780 --> 02:54:31.540]  developments on that front and a new study that's out, Clemson study. And it also supports
[02:54:31.540 --> 02:54:35.660]  the broadcast and it's also a business opportunity for folks. So we're funded by listeners like
[02:54:35.660 --> 02:54:41.480]  you who we really appreciate. These are stressful times, man. People know the world's in a major
[02:54:41.480 --> 02:54:45.100]  time of change and we've all, the Patriots have got to stick together and really fight
[02:54:45.100 --> 02:54:51.660]  hard for liberty. Let's talk to Glenn in Tennessee. You're on the air listing on GCNlive.com.
[02:54:51.660 --> 02:54:59.300]  Go ahead. Hey Alex, how are you? I'm good. Thanks for holding. Welcome. And a pleasure
[02:54:59.300 --> 02:55:02.980]  to be here. And I wanted to thank you. You have indeed woken a lot of people up, but
[02:55:02.980 --> 02:55:07.420]  I called today because I have a bit of a bone to pick with info wars on an article that
[02:55:07.420 --> 02:55:13.100]  I wrote last year that they used as one of their chief references, Ethan Hough. I know
[02:55:13.100 --> 02:55:18.860]  you have quoted on the show and the media. Glenn, I don't, I mean, what, what's the name
[02:55:18.860 --> 02:55:23.940]  of the article? Let me just get a pin here. In memoriam, Andrew Wordes. You remember Andrew
[02:55:23.940 --> 02:55:30.380]  the chicken man. They called him. Yes. Yes. The guy they basically killed. Well, they
[02:55:30.380 --> 02:55:35.980]  did indeed. And my point was the banality of evil in this country and the internal enemy
[02:55:35.980 --> 02:55:38.860]  is more dangerous than the external as bad as agenda.
[02:55:38.860 --> 02:55:42.820]  What did I do wrong? I sent reporters there to cover it and I said it was wrong. They
[02:55:42.820 --> 02:55:47.620]  killed him. What else can I do, man? I can't even keep track of what my own crew's doing
[02:55:47.620 --> 02:55:54.100]  half the time. It's not like I'm old saying, man, I, you know, I'll answer you if you will
[02:55:54.100 --> 02:56:00.140]  allow me. It's the, the report that you sent turned it into an agenda 21 story when it
[02:56:00.140 --> 02:56:01.140]  really wasn't.
[02:56:01.140 --> 02:56:05.680]  If you listen to his friends and family, it was the banality of evil of local bureaucrats
[02:56:05.680 --> 02:56:12.260]  doing this. I agree. And agenda 21 empowers them within a more scientifically designed
[02:56:12.260 --> 02:56:19.260]  template to manifest their evil. Yes, they do. Um, but that was my point. I tried writing
[02:56:19.260 --> 02:56:24.700]  Ethan Huff to make the correction and never got a response. And that was, that was doesn't
[02:56:24.700 --> 02:56:25.700]  write for us.
[02:56:25.700 --> 02:56:30.620]  We linked to somebody's stuff. God bless you, sir. You know what? I am a piece of garbage.
[02:56:30.620 --> 02:56:36.460]  You're right. I'm a piece of filth and I'm sorry that I didn't do more. I mean, I really
[02:56:36.460 --> 02:56:40.580]  am. I don't know what I could do. I don't know how I do it. I tried to stop. I don't
[02:56:40.580 --> 02:56:44.500]  like them killing people for chickens in their backyard that are legal. And I thought it,
[02:56:44.500 --> 02:56:49.020]  uh, and I understand it's frustrating, but I'm a piece of garbage. I mean, it's true.
[02:56:49.020 --> 02:56:54.420]  Uh, Gary in Illinois, you're on the air. Welcome. Hey, how are you doing Alex? I'm doing all
[02:56:54.420 --> 02:56:55.420]  right, brother.
[02:56:55.420 --> 02:57:00.700]  I'm 150% on the, all the guys side, man. Hey, check this out. My question is off the beaten
[02:57:00.700 --> 02:57:04.380]  path here. You know, that place they found down there in the Ozarks and said, we're guessing
[02:57:04.380 --> 02:57:09.460]  his crew went right. Well, anyway, I was wondering about, do you know maybe what they painted
[02:57:09.460 --> 02:57:13.420]  them walls with? Could it be the same stuff that they used in the $20? Because it's no
[02:57:13.420 --> 02:57:17.900]  longer a conspiracy theory.
[02:57:17.900 --> 02:57:22.500]  Well we know that an NSA top guy has built a giant armored fortress and they've been
[02:57:22.500 --> 02:57:28.620]  doing underground digging under it and hauling away tons of rock for and, and, and dirt for
[02:57:28.620 --> 02:57:33.380]  three years. So they've got a large facility there and they flip out of you, get around
[02:57:33.380 --> 02:57:38.060]  it. And, uh, I just want to apologize the last caller for that. It's my fault that's
[02:57:38.060 --> 02:57:42.900]  coming. Uh, so I'm apologizing for the Ozark bunker. I'm being sarcastic. What'd you think
[02:57:42.900 --> 02:57:44.620]  of the Ted Nugent interview? Pretty powerful.
[02:57:44.620 --> 02:57:49.500]  Man, Ted, he's all the way. It's because of him. My eyes are open and Jesse and you, man,
[02:57:49.500 --> 02:57:53.780]  I appreciate it very much. You know, I don't agree with everything Jesse Ventura says,
[02:57:53.780 --> 02:57:58.900]  but, but he's a real guy. He loves Liberty. He says when the government turns their guns
[02:57:58.900 --> 02:58:03.080]  in, I will. And it's the same thing with Ted Nugent. I don't agree with everything he says
[02:58:03.080 --> 02:58:04.080]  or does.
[02:58:04.080 --> 02:58:07.100]  You know, when he gets off into the Muslims and stuff, cause the globalists run all that,
[02:58:07.100 --> 02:58:11.660]  but I'm trying to wake him up on that area and he is a listener of the show. Uh, and
[02:58:11.660 --> 02:58:16.600]  so, you know, I'm able to then wake up all his fans by, you know, my whole deal is if
[02:58:16.600 --> 02:58:21.140]  people are real and can be gotten to, to wake up and if they really want a better world
[02:58:21.140 --> 02:58:28.300]  than I like them. But if they're fake cold blooded globalist, I'm their enemy. And so,
[02:58:28.300 --> 02:58:33.400]  uh, that's what it comes down to. I love real people. Thank you so much, Gary overdrive
[02:58:33.400 --> 02:58:37.620]  coming up. I'm going to come back with a Mac and Devon and Brian, and then Richard Reeves

[03:00:14.420 --> 03:00:24.020]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. All right,
[03:00:24.020 --> 03:00:27.260]  let's jam in a bunch of calls in this little short segment. Then we've got breaking health
[03:00:27.260 --> 03:00:33.460]  news. Richard Reeves coming up. Very important information. Let's talk to Mac in Texas. Then
[03:00:33.460 --> 03:00:39.060]  I got to talk to Brian who says ways to love the new world order. I want to get on a big
[03:00:39.060 --> 03:00:44.700]  razor blade and slide down into a pool of alcohol. That sounds like loving the new world
[03:00:44.700 --> 03:00:51.860]  order. Mac, you're on the air from Tejas. Go ahead. Hey, Alex. Hello. How you doing?
[03:00:51.860 --> 03:00:59.220]  Good, sir. Welcome. All right. Hey, uh, finally, finally, uh, talk to you, man. I'm not kind
[03:00:59.220 --> 03:01:01.740]  of feeling like people go through when they talk to you for the first time. I feel like
[03:01:01.740 --> 03:01:05.500]  I know you. I've been, I only been listening to you for about two years, but you got me
[03:01:05.500 --> 03:01:10.620]  fired up two years ago and I've been around Dallas. When I first heard about you and I
[03:01:10.620 --> 03:01:14.580]  started doing research, I got a, I bought a hundred pack of those business cards and
[03:01:14.580 --> 03:01:19.700]  I've been leaving them on trains and tasking them to people and taping them at schools.
[03:01:19.700 --> 03:01:23.660]  And I've been putting dumper stickers all over the place. But the reason I called today
[03:01:23.660 --> 03:01:30.980]  was two, two questions. One was, uh, you're not on Dallas anymore on 1630 AM, KKGM. And
[03:01:30.980 --> 03:01:36.740]  the only way I can listen to you is on the phone. And I believe in my heart, it's really
[03:01:36.740 --> 03:01:42.820]  important for you to be on, especially in this, in a city like Dallas, that is heavily
[03:01:42.820 --> 03:01:47.340]  steep in the occult. We were on in Dallas, I don't know, like two and a half, three years,
[03:01:47.340 --> 03:01:53.780]  and then they changed formats and that's just the way things like that go. Uh, and, uh,
[03:01:53.780 --> 03:02:01.060]  it's just unfortunate that, uh, that it's, it's not the general manager, it's the guy's
[03:02:01.060 --> 03:02:08.360]  father, uh, and, uh, you know, who owns stations across the country, I think. And also it's
[03:02:08.360 --> 03:02:12.020]  not good to go on Christian stations and say that, you know, there's not that it's a post
[03:02:12.020 --> 03:02:13.020]  tribulation rapture.
[03:02:13.020 --> 03:02:17.420]  I mean, I'm just guessing what it could be, but that's just unfortunate. Uh, but the affiliates
[03:02:17.420 --> 03:02:20.420]  come and go, you know, that's why we have the free iPhone app, the free droid apps and
[03:02:20.420 --> 03:02:25.780]  the listen page and full words.com forward slash listen. Uh, and that's why we make the
[03:02:25.780 --> 03:02:29.660]  films and that's why we have the YouTube videos and it's why, cause affiliates come and go.
[03:02:29.660 --> 03:02:33.700]  I mean, I can't tell you how many times we become number one in a city, even on a small
[03:02:33.700 --> 03:02:40.940]  station, we'll beat rush Limbaugh, uh, you know, in Rochester, New York or in, um, places
[03:02:40.940 --> 03:02:46.740]  in Florida, like Orlando or, uh, you know, in places like San Diego. And then the station
[03:02:46.740 --> 03:02:50.580]  just says, y'all you're, you're off. Uh, yeah, that was just a management decision.
[03:02:50.580 --> 03:02:56.820]  Yeah. You see, being number one is a problem when you're telling the truth. Uh, and, uh,
[03:02:56.820 --> 03:03:00.500]  they always say it's just get the highest ratings and, and you'll, uh, you know, you'll
[03:03:00.500 --> 03:03:04.500]  be the top of the heap and that's not how it works. Uh, you know, you've got to be interesting
[03:03:04.500 --> 03:03:07.540]  and get ratings and push what they want.
[03:03:07.540 --> 03:03:12.340]  But notice Glenn Beck rush Limbaugh, all of them are having to more and more sound like
[03:03:12.340 --> 03:03:19.980]  Alex Jones. You see, I'm not changing. They're changing and I'm going to completely force
[03:03:19.980 --> 03:03:28.260]  through their audiences. That's my greatest success to the grace of God is that I now
[03:03:28.260 --> 03:03:33.060]  hear myself when I tune into Glenn Beck, I now hear myself on rush Limbaugh. I now hear
[03:03:33.060 --> 03:03:34.580]  myself on Michael Savage.
[03:03:34.580 --> 03:03:41.380]  I now more and more the ideas of our guests, the callers, myself of real Liberty. We are
[03:03:41.380 --> 03:03:46.460]  taking them over, not the other way around. Uh, and it's happening and, and, and, and
[03:03:46.460 --> 03:03:53.180]  it's thanks to drudge report.com and other people that, you know, uh, really love Liberty.
[03:03:53.180 --> 03:03:56.180]  And does it mean Drudge is perfect? Does it mean I'm perfect? Does it mean Roland Daley
[03:03:56.180 --> 03:04:00.060]  is perfect as no, but you know what? We're pro private property rights. We're pro family.
[03:04:00.060 --> 03:04:03.460]  We're pro gun. We're pro national sovereignty.
[03:04:03.460 --> 03:04:09.260]  And we're getting down to the end game here for the globalist. And this is a life risking
[03:04:09.260 --> 03:04:13.180]  event for me. I mean, make no mistake. I'm out of time. Uh, thank you. Caller. Uh, I'm
[03:04:13.180 --> 03:04:20.100]  sorry, Brian, real quick. Tell me how to love the new world order. Go ahead.
[03:04:20.100 --> 03:04:27.220]  Matthew five, chapter 33 says, you've heard it said to love your neighbor and hate your
[03:04:27.220 --> 03:04:34.140]  enemy. I tell you love your enemy and pray for those who persecute you. Don't even, uh,
[03:04:34.140 --> 03:04:38.180]  he says, what, uh, what reward will you get if you only love your own?
[03:04:38.180 --> 03:04:43.340]  But Jesus also beat the money changers with a bullwhip with a cat or nine tail and overturned
[03:04:43.340 --> 03:04:47.000]  their tables. He said, go buy a sword. It's all in the time. It's like when he turns the
[03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:50.900]  other cheek, they were going to set him up and kill him. It was all teaching us. And
[03:04:50.900 --> 03:04:55.940]  those that have ears to hear, we understand it that others don't. All right. Coming in
[03:04:55.940 --> 03:05:01.540]  the seat right here at Richard Reeves state, stay with him.

[03:07:00.820 --> 03:07:06.580]  We travel so much and having a fake TV, well it gives added peace of mind. Burglars look
[03:07:06.580 --> 03:07:12.780]  for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional burglars
[03:07:12.780 --> 03:07:18.140]  into thinking someone is home watching television. As a recent widow living alone, it gives me
[03:07:18.140 --> 03:07:22.980]  great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and
[03:07:22.980 --> 03:07:28.020]  pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home. Fake
[03:07:28.020 --> 03:07:33.500]  TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer. And they're so easy to
[03:07:33.500 --> 03:07:37.900]  use, you just plug them in and they're ready to go. Plus, they're so affordable that we
[03:07:37.900 --> 03:07:44.100]  have one upstairs and downstairs. Fake TV is only $29.95 with free shipping. Order your
[03:07:44.100 --> 03:07:58.380]  fake TV by calling 877-5FAKETV or go to FAKETV.com. That's 877-532-5388 or FAKETV.com. Fake TV,
[03:07:58.380 --> 03:08:06.120]  the burglar deterrent. Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones
[03:08:06.120 --> 03:08:16.980]  on the GCN Radio Network. Welcome back to Infowars.com. I am your guest
[03:08:16.980 --> 03:08:22.100]  host here, Richard Gries. What an honor and privilege to be thrown into the hot seat here
[03:08:22.100 --> 03:08:28.800]  and welcome everybody for staying into overdrive. And if you missed the earlier hours of today's
[03:08:28.800 --> 03:08:32.900]  show, make sure and catch the archive. Make sure and catch the repeats, the YouTube, the
[03:08:32.900 --> 03:08:38.320]  archives of Infowars.com today. Alex Jones had a fantastic interview with Ted Nugent
[03:08:38.320 --> 03:08:42.400]  on earlier today and it was just awesome. You'll definitely want to hear everything
[03:08:42.400 --> 03:08:47.620]  they had to say in that interview. Folks, thank you for joining us. We are live still
[03:08:47.620 --> 03:08:52.780]  in this fourth hour of overdrive and we've invited a very special guest on today with
[03:08:52.780 --> 03:08:57.760]  us, Tom Chenault with Young Jevity, one of the big distributors with Young Jevity, also
[03:08:57.760 --> 03:09:04.600]  part of our Infowars team as an honorary member of Infowarsteam.com. So we've got Tom on with
[03:09:04.600 --> 03:09:11.220]  Skype on us and a little bit about Tom before we intro Tom is he's got his own radio show.
[03:09:11.220 --> 03:09:18.920]  He's had the longest running radio show on the home business side of the home business
[03:09:18.920 --> 03:09:28.360]  network side of the business. Tom Chenault has had the longest running home based business
[03:09:28.360 --> 03:09:34.560]  show. I'm sorry, I got a little bit nervous there. But anyway, Tom has had a long running
[03:09:34.560 --> 03:09:39.540]  show based about home business and he covers it like no other. I've heard his show many
[03:09:39.540 --> 03:09:47.320]  times on GCNlive.com and he's covered this like for 20 plus years and plus he's been
[03:09:47.320 --> 03:09:53.000]  a big distributor with Young Jevity now going on 15 plus years so he can really talk about
[03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:57.920]  the ins and outs of the business. One thing that has prompted us to have Tom on and invite
[03:09:57.920 --> 03:10:04.600]  him on is because the Infowars team has had so much interest lately from preferred customers
[03:10:04.600 --> 03:10:10.200]  out there on Infowars team in becoming distributors. There are more and more people interested
[03:10:10.200 --> 03:10:14.820]  in becoming distributors to learn about how to promote Infowars team and how to promote
[03:10:14.820 --> 03:10:19.960]  Infowars health and get more products out there, more great health products out there.
[03:10:19.960 --> 03:10:26.960]  So Tom has had the long running radio show. He was a great salesman of very highly successful
[03:10:26.960 --> 03:10:32.560]  corporate salesman selling aircraft for the Beach Aircraft Company. So he's had a pretty
[03:10:32.560 --> 03:10:40.180]  amazing variant jobs during his life, varying levels of career in his life. He also went
[03:10:40.180 --> 03:10:45.400]  on to become a stockbroker during the dot com heyday of the 1980s. He got into network
[03:10:45.400 --> 03:10:51.440]  marketing 24 years ago and was named one of the top 25 network marketers in the world
[03:10:51.440 --> 03:10:55.600]  by the Multilevel Marketing International Association. He has the longest home running
[03:10:55.600 --> 03:11:00.560]  base business radio show as I mentioned earlier and he's heavily involved in industry associations
[03:11:00.560 --> 03:11:05.660]  in attempt to slow down and show that people that network marketing is an important and
[03:11:05.660 --> 03:11:11.640]  profitable career. Folks, I've looked at a lot of business opportunities lately to see
[03:11:11.640 --> 03:11:17.360]  what's out there competing with Infowars team and Infowars health. I know a lot of folks
[03:11:17.360 --> 03:11:21.560]  have looked at real estate and things like that and I had an interesting comparison come
[03:11:21.560 --> 03:11:27.780]  up with real estate where you can get leveraged and end up borrowing about $100,000 to leverage
[03:11:27.780 --> 03:11:32.240]  a nice piece of property or maybe even a fixer upper nowadays, $100,000 gets you a fixer
[03:11:32.240 --> 03:11:37.920]  upper and you may end up after you've gone all in and invested all your cash, you may
[03:11:37.920 --> 03:11:43.760]  have an opportunity to have $300 or $400 cash flow after you've invested $5,000 or $10,000
[03:11:43.760 --> 03:11:49.040]  of your own dollars plus put your credit on the line to the tune of $100,000. So when
[03:11:49.040 --> 03:11:52.840]  you compare those opportunities like that as good as real estate is, let me tell you
[03:11:52.840 --> 03:11:56.560]  folks I don't really want to knock real estate either because many, many millionaires have
[03:11:56.560 --> 03:12:01.920]  been made in real estate. It's really amazing how many investors have really done well with
[03:12:01.920 --> 03:12:07.560]  real estate but when you hear the opportunity that Infowars team, Infowars health deliver
[03:12:07.560 --> 03:12:13.040]  above and beyond with way less risk and more opportunity, I tell you it really gets people
[03:12:13.040 --> 03:12:17.640]  fired up. So without further ado I want to go ahead and introduce Tom Chenault. Tom are
[03:12:17.640 --> 03:12:18.840]  you on the line with us?
[03:12:18.840 --> 03:12:23.280]  I am right here. How you doing Richard Reeves? It's an honor to be on the show. I really,
[03:12:23.280 --> 03:12:24.680]  really appreciate it.
[03:12:24.680 --> 03:12:29.800]  Well Tom thank you for being willing to come on and as I stated earlier we just have more
[03:12:29.800 --> 03:12:33.640]  and more people that are asking how do I become distributors. Is that a question that you're
[03:12:33.640 --> 03:12:36.160]  getting a lot nowadays?
[03:12:36.160 --> 03:12:42.060]  Yeah I hear it a ton and the reason is because it's the last house on the block. Everybody
[03:12:42.060 --> 03:12:48.000]  expected so many things to be the solution to their problem whether it was 401k or their
[03:12:48.000 --> 03:12:54.320]  job or whatever it is and quite frankly everything else is failing us and it's great to want
[03:12:54.320 --> 03:12:59.000]  to buy real estate you know and I like buying real estate you know I buy gold, I buy silver,
[03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:04.160]  I buy all that stuff but guess what it takes money to buy that and when your income's getting
[03:13:04.160 --> 03:13:09.300]  cut back it's a little bit impossible to think about buying things that are going to create
[03:13:09.300 --> 03:13:16.120]  residual income. You can't participate in an oil drilling program, buy a rental house
[03:13:16.120 --> 03:13:21.640]  or buy gold and silver if you don't have excess cash and that's why people are flocking to
[03:13:21.640 --> 03:13:24.440]  the InfoWars team.
[03:13:24.440 --> 03:13:28.680]  Yes Tom I agree with you and we do get those emails every day. If you go to InfoWars team
[03:13:28.680 --> 03:13:33.280]  InfoWars Health and you are a preferred customer and you want to see about becoming a distributor
[03:13:33.280 --> 03:13:38.880]  just check on there on those websites InfoWars Health, InfoWarsTeam.com and you will find
[03:13:38.880 --> 03:13:44.760]  an email there. Catherine at InfoWars Team she can help you and take the steps to upgrade
[03:13:44.760 --> 03:13:50.200]  from preferred customer and distributor. There's the website right there. By the way the InfoWarsHealth.com
[03:13:50.200 --> 03:14:02.080]  product order line in case you don't have a computer it's 1-888-789-9277, 1-888-789-9277.
[03:14:02.080 --> 03:14:06.240]  But Tom we got a little bit ahead of ourselves you know we started talking about how many
[03:14:06.240 --> 03:14:12.440]  folks really are jumping on board into becoming distributors of the products but one of the
[03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:17.160]  main reasons that's happening is because of this Clemson study that just came out here
[03:14:17.160 --> 03:14:22.680]  in early January of 2013 the Clemson study came out where they're talking about two of
[03:14:22.680 --> 03:14:28.720]  the keystone products of Younggivity and InfoWars Health, InfoWars Team are the Beyond Tang
[03:14:28.720 --> 03:14:36.720]  Tangerine and the Ultimate Classic and it showed how in multiple situations with the
[03:14:36.720 --> 03:14:42.080]  cancerous colon cells, cancerous liver cells, cancerous stomach cells, cancerous breast
[03:14:42.080 --> 03:14:49.200]  cells that these two products are really reducing those numbers of cells and so this Clemson
[03:14:49.200 --> 03:14:54.120]  study really has prompted an influx of more interest into the company. Tom can you elaborate
[03:14:54.120 --> 03:14:55.120]  on that?
[03:14:55.120 --> 03:15:00.760]  Well it's one of those studies that wasn't paid for by the companies you hear about especially
[03:15:00.760 --> 03:15:04.680]  you know it's ridiculous that you take a look at the pharmaceutical companies that fund
[03:15:04.680 --> 03:15:10.380]  all these studies and end up obviously getting paid big, big money and that's how they keep
[03:15:10.380 --> 03:15:16.700]  us sick and this is a whole different conversation. Clemson did not get paid to do that study
[03:15:16.700 --> 03:15:23.080]  on the Beyond Tang Tangerine and the various Younggivity products. They chose Younggivity
[03:15:23.080 --> 03:15:29.080]  because they wanted to test something that was already generating great results and all
[03:15:29.080 --> 03:15:36.040]  you need to do is call somebody or email somebody over at the Alex Jones Team, InfoWars Team
[03:15:36.040 --> 03:15:40.440]  and you're going to be able to get a copy of that Clemson study where you can read with
[03:15:40.440 --> 03:15:46.680]  your own eyes exactly what was said by them about these products. I mean I don't make
[03:15:46.680 --> 03:15:51.880]  product claims, never thought about doing that. All I can tell you is if you can read
[03:15:51.880 --> 03:15:56.880]  you're going to say to yourself I have got to have my loved ones and myself on these
[03:15:56.880 --> 03:16:01.840]  great products. That study is that much of a testimonial.
[03:16:01.840 --> 03:16:07.240]  Well folks I'll tell you I personally joined on the InfoWars Team back in January 2011
[03:16:07.240 --> 03:16:11.460]  when Alex first started promoting InfoWars Team and that was in January 2011. He had
[03:16:11.460 --> 03:16:15.800]  Doc Wallach on his first interview there during that time and I signed up right away and I
[03:16:15.800 --> 03:16:21.400]  joined up as part of the team and I've been getting some variant of the Healthy Star Pack
[03:16:21.400 --> 03:16:27.040]  ever since and I'll tell you it's really, really been great and the number of testimonials
[03:16:27.040 --> 03:16:31.960]  that I hear from preferred customers of InfoWars Team all the time are amazing. As a matter
[03:16:31.960 --> 03:16:37.200]  of fact I remember about a year ago, a little over a year ago we went to Dallas and did
[03:16:37.200 --> 03:16:43.480]  a live event in Dallas and Alex spoke at the event there at the Lakewood Theater and I
[03:16:43.480 --> 03:16:48.280]  remember during the Q&A that there was at least one person, there were several people
[03:16:48.280 --> 03:16:53.760]  with testimonials for the InfoWars Team products. There's quite a few testimonials but one in
[03:16:53.760 --> 03:16:59.480]  particular that I really recall that he credited Alex in bringing forth these products to his
[03:16:59.480 --> 03:17:06.480]  awareness as saving one of his relatives' lives. I mean that's how great these products
[03:17:06.480 --> 03:17:11.440]  are and how helpful and beneficial they have been to a lot of people that this person stood
[03:17:11.440 --> 03:17:15.960]  out there and said you saved and I don't remember which of his relatives he said but he said
[03:17:15.960 --> 03:17:20.920]  you saved their life with you bringing their awareness about the need for supplements,
[03:17:20.920 --> 03:17:28.680]  the need for nutrition and bringing these products on board and aware to the InfoWars.com
[03:17:28.680 --> 03:17:33.880]  public and audience. So it was really a powerful statement that night and Tom I'm sure you
[03:17:33.880 --> 03:17:36.480]  hear a lot of those testimonials as well.
[03:17:36.480 --> 03:17:40.640]  It's constant. You know the neat thing about building a home-based business around a product
[03:17:40.640 --> 03:17:46.720]  that is this emotional is you hear stories like that every day and we are so nutritionally
[03:17:46.720 --> 03:17:52.480]  deficient as a society out there that anybody that gets out there and starts drinking the
[03:17:52.480 --> 03:17:58.200]  Beyond Tangy Tangerine or any one of the Young Jevity products, they're going to notice immediate,
[03:17:58.200 --> 03:18:03.360]  immediate results and it's going to be exciting because we are starving to death. There's
[03:18:03.360 --> 03:18:08.840]  no nutrition in the foods. There's no nutrition in the soils. So they've got to go someplace
[03:18:08.840 --> 03:18:14.320]  and Dr. Wallach and Steve Wallach, the team behind Young Jevity, I am telling you they
[03:18:14.320 --> 03:18:20.040]  have delivered a product line that just anybody can sell and that's the exciting thing about
[03:18:20.040 --> 03:18:26.280]  being involved as a business building Young Jevity rep. You've got the ability to sell
[03:18:26.280 --> 03:18:30.960]  and get paid on a product that's far better than you are a salesman.
[03:18:30.960 --> 03:18:35.940]  Tom, I couldn't say that any better and you always have a great way with words on those
[03:18:35.940 --> 03:18:42.640]  type of things. One of the things that you want to talk about were the reasons for the
[03:18:42.640 --> 03:18:48.400]  stigma behind network marketing. Why do a lot of people have kind of a negative view
[03:18:48.400 --> 03:18:51.600]  on network marketing? What's caused that over the years? You've been involved in this industry
[03:18:51.600 --> 03:18:54.040]  for many years. Give us a breakdown on that.
[03:18:54.040 --> 03:19:00.360]  I've got 25 years in the industry and it is really, really an unbelievably great industry
[03:19:00.360 --> 03:19:04.640]  that you don't ever want to tell anybody in the past that you were involved with and the
[03:19:04.640 --> 03:19:09.880]  reason was because there was a predecessor company called Amway out there. Great company.
[03:19:09.880 --> 03:19:15.000]  They're doing billions of dollars a year but they just literally sneaked up on everybody
[03:19:15.000 --> 03:19:20.120]  on the planet. So everybody's afraid of being one of those kinds of guys and I'm telling
[03:19:20.120 --> 03:19:24.920]  you, you don't need to be one of those kinds of people. You've got a product that you can
[03:19:24.920 --> 03:19:30.780]  absolutely scream from the rooftops with us but the reason people failed wasn't that.
[03:19:30.780 --> 03:19:35.360]  The reason 99% of the people fail out there is because they didn't have the team support
[03:19:35.360 --> 03:19:43.880]  and the cool thing is with the InfoWars team, the training is in place. It's literally automated
[03:19:43.880 --> 03:19:49.360]  and all you need to do is get in the system and do what the InfoWars team people teach
[03:19:49.360 --> 03:19:53.720]  you to do and you're going to start building literally overnight. It is exciting.
[03:19:53.720 --> 03:19:58.120]  Tom, I tell you, it is exciting. We're about to go to break. We've got one more segment
[03:19:58.120 --> 03:20:01.160]  left with Tom Chenault. Folks, stay tuned. We'll be right back.

[03:20:45.560 --> 03:20:53.220]  and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination. The war is here.
[03:20:53.220 --> 03:21:01.420]  It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

[03:24:24.600 --> 03:24:30.760]  Reeves. And once again, I want to thank Alex Jones for plopping me in this Attila the Hun
[03:24:30.760 --> 03:24:37.800]  T-Rex of political talk chair here. It's a pretty scary thing to try to think about.
[03:24:37.800 --> 03:24:42.000]  But anyway, here I am. And we've got Tom Chenault, our special guest. We're live. This is our
[03:24:42.000 --> 03:24:49.040]  last segment today, March 26th of 2013. And make sure and tune in to the earlier hours
[03:24:49.040 --> 03:24:54.340]  of The Alex Jones Show today. He had a great interview with Ted Nugent. Pretty awesome
[03:24:54.340 --> 03:24:59.240]  show there for I think they went on for about an hour and a half. So don't miss the earlier
[03:24:59.240 --> 03:25:04.160]  three hours of the show today. Make sure and catch one of those archives and tune in.
[03:25:04.160 --> 03:25:09.120]  All right, we've got Tom. And Tom, we've only got about five minutes left here before we're
[03:25:09.120 --> 03:25:14.620]  going to wrap up the show. And one of the questions I'd like to ask you is what exactly
[03:25:14.620 --> 03:25:17.600]  is a professional network marketer?
[03:25:17.600 --> 03:25:21.780]  You know, somebody that takes this business really, really seriously. You've got Alex
[03:25:21.780 --> 03:25:28.720]  Jones out there and he is creating a cause. He's got a mission and the guy works nonstop
[03:25:28.720 --> 03:25:35.900]  and supporting him with infowarsteam.com and going out there and talking about this nutrition,
[03:25:35.900 --> 03:25:41.520]  taking our health back, taking our money back and taking our time back, take some training.
[03:25:41.520 --> 03:25:46.160]  And the way that you do that is you become a professional network marketer. And the cool
[03:25:46.160 --> 03:25:52.720]  thing about that is, is the systems are in place already at infowarsteam.com. We just
[03:25:52.720 --> 03:25:59.040]  need people for the chairs. And if you'll just jump in and call Catherine or call Richard
[03:25:59.040 --> 03:26:04.880]  or call Alex and just say, I want to learn a little bit more about what it is you're
[03:26:04.880 --> 03:26:10.100]  talking about, about being a professional network marketer and leading a team on this
[03:26:10.100 --> 03:26:15.320]  cause called Better Nutrition, More Time, More Money. I'll tell you what, we'll train
[03:26:15.320 --> 03:26:20.400]  you. We'll teach you how to teach people how to do this business because this isn't one
[03:26:20.400 --> 03:26:25.360]  of those things where you're jamming something down the throats of your friends and family.
[03:26:25.360 --> 03:26:30.280]  We're going to train you to deliver a professional message to people that lets them understand
[03:26:30.280 --> 03:26:35.000]  exactly what's at stake if they don't do it, which is loss of time, loss of money, loss
[03:26:35.000 --> 03:26:38.420]  of health. And we're going to get you involved with the products and we're going to get you
[03:26:38.420 --> 03:26:43.080]  involved with this cause and you're going to help Alex Jones, you're going to help Richard,
[03:26:43.080 --> 03:26:46.360]  you're going to help Catherine and you're going to help a whole lot more other people
[03:26:46.360 --> 03:26:51.880]  help themselves. And we'll teach you how to do that. That's the simple short story.
[03:26:51.880 --> 03:26:56.800]  That's really the key simple short story. Some of the folks, one of the folks got left
[03:26:56.800 --> 03:27:01.940]  out and you're going to be helping Doc Wallach especially on his mission. He's been on this
[03:27:01.940 --> 03:27:09.780]  mission to help get people on board with their health for 20, 25, 30 years. He really is
[03:27:09.780 --> 03:27:15.240]  on the cutting edge of getting things figured out why people are obese, why people are sick,
[03:27:15.240 --> 03:27:20.580]  why people are tired. And he's really getting that dialed in. Doc Wallach's mission, Alex
[03:27:20.580 --> 03:27:25.760]  Jones' mission. Folks, when you get on the board with Infowars team and Infowarshealth.com,
[03:27:25.760 --> 03:27:30.780]  you are helping Alex Jones and Doc Wallach. And don't forget with Doc Wallach, he's gone
[03:27:30.780 --> 03:27:37.000]  against the FDA six or seven times. Tom, how many times against the FDA?
[03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:42.480]  It's too many to count and who he is. If you really want to describe Dr. Wallach in language
[03:27:42.480 --> 03:27:48.400]  people can understand, he could be described as the Alex Jones of nutrition. He is not
[03:27:48.400 --> 03:27:53.920]  afraid to look anybody in the eye and state what he believes to be true no matter what
[03:27:53.920 --> 03:27:59.820]  the consequences. We need more people like him on this planet. And when we meet a message
[03:27:59.820 --> 03:28:06.940]  that needs told, Alex's or Dr. Wallach's, we need to lock arms and tell that story.
[03:28:06.940 --> 03:28:13.600]  And that's why I'm on here today is to try to help find some leaders to help us kick
[03:28:13.600 --> 03:28:16.300]  this message out to the world. So yeah.
[03:28:16.300 --> 03:28:20.900]  And Tom, fortunately more leaders are arising out of the ranks of Infowars team. We want
[03:28:20.900 --> 03:28:25.400]  to thank all y'all out there that have been on Infowars team for more than two years now
[03:28:25.400 --> 03:28:30.380]  and Infowars Health in the last six to eight months. Those organizations are both growing
[03:28:30.380 --> 03:28:36.100]  very rapidly. And folks, I want to let everybody know also, those of you that have been active,
[03:28:36.100 --> 03:28:41.060]  we've got the convention coming up May 2nd, 3rd, and 4th. Get a chance to meet Tom and
[03:28:41.060 --> 03:28:45.180]  Doc Wallach and a whole host of folks. Mary Lou Hender is going to be there. Who all else
[03:28:45.180 --> 03:28:47.900]  is going to be there, Tom, during the convention?
[03:28:47.900 --> 03:28:52.980]  How about Ben Fuchs? How about Dr. Peter Glidden, Dr. Wallach, the whole management team? I
[03:28:52.980 --> 03:28:58.060]  mean, it's Theo Ratliff, the basketball player that's on the show a lot. I mean, it's going
[03:28:58.060 --> 03:29:02.640]  to be over the top. And you're going to get to actually meet and all the team. I mean,
[03:29:02.640 --> 03:29:07.300]  you take a look at the Laura Chigaras and the people that are inside of your team right
[03:29:07.300 --> 03:29:13.940]  now, it is amazing how many great people that have come together to spread the cause of
[03:29:13.940 --> 03:29:20.820]  Infowarsteam.com. I mean, it is crazy. And all you need to do is plug in, get to Las
[03:29:20.820 --> 03:29:25.260]  Vegas, and it'll be a blast. Tom, we've got about 30 seconds left. What would you like
[03:29:25.260 --> 03:29:30.740]  to close out with? I'm just telling you, if you do nothing else today, go to Infowarsteam.com.
[03:29:30.740 --> 03:29:35.460]  Send them an email. Tell them you want to explore the possibility of becoming a team
[03:29:35.460 --> 03:29:39.700]  leader for the Alex Jones, Dr. Wallach message. Thanks, Richard.
