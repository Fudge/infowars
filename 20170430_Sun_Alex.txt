[00:00.000 --> 00:16.760]  You are listening to an info wars dot com front line report it's Alex Jones
[00:30.000 --> 00:37.080]  Sunday April 30th 2017 I'm your host Alex Jones we're gonna be here as we are
[00:37.080 --> 00:42.920]  every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. Central I just came off the big nightmare two-week
[00:42.920 --> 00:46.880]  custody trial of my ex-wife I had kept that private for years that divorce
[00:46.880 --> 00:50.440]  happened started like three and a half years ago ended more than two years ago
[00:50.440 --> 00:56.000]  filed by her I tried to keep my family out of it I did the press was pulled into
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.760]  it and of course the press got it all wrong I've had sole custody for two
[01:01.760 --> 01:07.520]  plus years two and a half years not by my doing but by my ex-wife basically
[01:07.520 --> 01:12.000]  having a breakdown and having to go voluntarily into a treatment center in
[01:12.000 --> 01:17.240]  Arizona and then in California and then just people got involved from the
[01:17.240 --> 01:22.840]  outside came in and it's turned into a true nightmare the entire time I've been
[01:22.840 --> 01:28.720]  seeking joint custody 50-50 so what my children want and tomorrow I will present
[01:28.720 --> 01:33.280]  actually three and a half years of documents I showed four on Friday I've
[01:33.280 --> 01:37.400]  been a very private person but I'm not gonna have the statesman and others that
[01:37.400 --> 01:42.960]  I'm quite frankly considering actions against sit there and just say that I
[01:42.960 --> 01:47.560]  tried alienate my kids I tried to take them I did all this when it was my ex
[01:47.560 --> 01:54.800]  wife that filed for me to have supervised visits back in December of 2013 and
[01:54.800 --> 01:58.280]  called in the social workers everybody they were like you've done nothing what's
[01:58.280 --> 02:02.640]  going on here and then my children from the research were being alienated away
[02:02.640 --> 02:06.920]  from me and the people that she'd called in to try to declare me a bad parent
[02:06.920 --> 02:10.480]  said hey lady you need to stop and she wouldn't and so they took them away from
[02:10.480 --> 02:16.560]  her I didn't do that and then it's just twilight zone to be in court with
[02:16.560 --> 02:24.080]  literally said sometimes 50 media outlets 15 20 national TV crews 30 40
[02:24.080 --> 02:29.320]  sometimes news reporters at one time always five or six for two weeks and to
[02:29.320 --> 02:33.600]  then open the paper up and Jones alienated her children and and his wife
[02:33.600 --> 02:37.680]  was asking the judge to take him away so they can be reprogrammed not to be
[02:37.680 --> 02:41.560]  alienated it when yeah just just watch what the judge does I don't know what
[02:41.560 --> 02:45.240]  the judge is gonna do it's the same judge that three separate times told her
[02:45.240 --> 02:48.360]  she had supervised visits or couldn't have overnight with them from what the
[02:48.360 --> 02:52.440]  judge saw but that's how law works what was in the past divorce or other
[02:52.440 --> 02:56.960]  hearings did not come into this so under law the jury could not be told
[02:56.960 --> 03:02.560]  basically anything and it was just amazing so I've got big World War three
[03:02.560 --> 03:05.400]  news to cover I've got so much more to get to I know everybody's tuning in
[03:05.400 --> 03:10.680]  wanting to know about the divorce was one of the biggest news stories in the
[03:10.680 --> 03:15.520]  country the last few weeks you notice it's very quiet now that I was that the
[03:15.520 --> 03:19.040]  gag order was lifted on Friday and I came out and made statements very very
[03:19.040 --> 03:23.760]  quiet from that point on and in hundreds of fake headlines hundreds you're
[03:23.760 --> 03:28.440]  saying I lost custody of my children I have joint custody now exactly what I
[03:28.440 --> 03:31.960]  was always seeking so it's been a nightmare and it's one of the things
[03:31.960 --> 03:35.120]  I've been dealing with behind the scenes for three-plus years on top
[03:35.120 --> 03:38.640]  everything else and on top of the globalist coming after me in Google and
[03:38.640 --> 03:42.560]  Adroll throwing me off online advertising and you know being inside
[03:42.560 --> 03:49.600]  the wiki leaks of the Democrats want to shut me down and all of it we have gone
[03:49.600 --> 03:53.440]  through a lot here together but understand something I have expected
[03:53.440 --> 03:59.000]  all of this fight in the globalist but now is the main assault I wish my ex
[03:59.000 --> 04:05.040]  wife well I hope that you know she has a great life and I hope that she can you
[04:05.040 --> 04:07.480]  know get to where she has a good relationship with the children again and
[04:07.480 --> 04:12.480]  so that's all I wish that's all I hope but I'll be quite frank with you the
[04:12.480 --> 04:19.080]  media I'm just pretty much fed up to here and just with the incredible
[04:19.080 --> 04:27.240]  incredible deception that they are constantly constantly involved in I
[04:27.240 --> 04:31.320]  mean the media knew full well everything that came out in that trial and they
[04:31.320 --> 04:35.520]  reported nothing that was truthful nothing that was accurate and that's why
[04:35.520 --> 04:38.600]  the mainstream media is the number one enemy of the American people because
[04:38.600 --> 04:42.200]  it's globalist far and owned it's her to demoralize us and here to dumbest
[04:42.200 --> 04:46.320]  town now we come back the president says there's a huge threat of World War

[06:10.200 --> 06:17.240]  he never gives up he's alex jones broadcasting from deep in the heart of
[06:17.240 --> 06:26.720]  texas
[06:26.720 --> 06:30.560]  your negotiator if you need something from somebody you need china to help you
[06:30.560 --> 06:33.960]  with north korea doesn't that send a message to china we're not going to bug
[06:33.960 --> 06:38.200]  you about human rights about about intellectual property in the south
[06:38.200 --> 06:41.000]  china sea we're not going to put too much heat on you aren't you breaking one
[06:41.000 --> 06:45.720]  of your own negotiating rules no i think that frankly north korea's may be more
[06:45.720 --> 06:50.400]  important than trade trade is very important but massive warfare with
[06:50.400 --> 06:55.120]  millions potentially millions of people being killed that as we would say
[06:55.120 --> 06:59.960]  trumps trade let me ask you okay do you understand what i'm saying and if i can
[06:59.960 --> 07:04.160]  use trade as a method to get china because i happen to think that china
[07:04.160 --> 07:11.600]  does have reasonably good powers over over north korea now maybe not you know
[07:11.600 --> 07:16.920]  ultimate but pretty good powers now if china can help us with north korea and
[07:16.920 --> 07:21.440]  can solve that problem that's worth making not as good a trade deal for the
[07:21.440 --> 07:27.840]  united states excuse me right what do you know now the truth is north korea has
[07:27.840 --> 07:30.600]  been firing missiles into the south china sea threatening to attack south
[07:30.600 --> 07:37.320]  korea threatening to nuke tokyo and what trump saying is if he can get china to
[07:37.320 --> 07:41.000]  come in and basically shut down north korea that that's worth making
[07:41.000 --> 07:47.280]  concessions to china in trade deals and that is the entire art of the deal and i
[07:47.280 --> 07:49.920]  guess if we don't have world war three and kill everybody on the planet you
[07:49.920 --> 07:58.200]  could say that's better than not having a better trade deal but i would like to
[07:58.200 --> 08:04.400]  have both now trump is launching a bunch of drones now he's moving to bombers
[08:04.400 --> 08:08.480]  into guam with nuclear weapons he has been massing more us troops and brought
[08:08.480 --> 08:13.200]  in three carrier strike task forces this is a big escalation because north
[08:13.200 --> 08:18.560]  korea and the policy of appeasement of the last 30 years plus is backfiring
[08:18.560 --> 08:23.960]  that is something obviously to watch don's drone army donald trump is
[08:23.960 --> 08:28.160]  unleashing a killer drone squad as us admiral warren's military is hammering
[08:28.160 --> 08:32.240]  ices so hard they're running out of bombs and that is the good news ices
[08:32.240 --> 08:37.160]  being driven out of syria and out of iraq and is close to 90% crushed according
[08:37.160 --> 08:40.720]  to military estimates the problem is a lot of them now are infiltrating back
[08:40.720 --> 08:44.800]  into europe and the middle east and north africa and a lot of experts are
[08:44.800 --> 08:49.160]  warning of massive new terror attacks if we don't vet the quote refugees that
[08:49.160 --> 08:52.800]  are coming into the united states and they're not being vetted they come out
[08:52.800 --> 08:56.680]  of seven countries that basically give passports to anybody like sudan
[08:56.680 --> 09:03.040]  somalia libya you name it and then the un certifies them with no research that
[09:03.040 --> 09:06.800]  the state department accepts that un policy and then the refugees are brought
[09:06.800 --> 09:11.320]  in unvetted to the claims out there that you hear that they're vetting
[09:11.320 --> 09:14.720]  refugees is bull and the people out there that are promoting open borders
[09:14.720 --> 09:18.520]  like tort soros and the owner of shabani yogurt and others they want to
[09:18.520 --> 09:22.760]  say oh these people carry out rapes or shootings or bombings or run over folks
[09:22.760 --> 09:26.640]  with cars it's not their fault they didn't call for it they just called for
[09:26.640 --> 09:30.880]  bringing in the unvetted refugees and claim oh well the state department
[09:30.880 --> 09:36.480]  vetted them the state department is not vetting them and you know that and you
[09:36.480 --> 09:41.160]  the headlines alex jones sued by owner of shabani yogurt for criticizing
[09:41.160 --> 09:46.200]  refugee program and saying refugees are bringing in tuberculosis I've got
[09:46.200 --> 09:49.600]  hundreds of mainstream news articles admitting that just in that area of
[09:49.600 --> 09:54.480]  Idaho they've got a 500% increase in tuberculosis and they point it directly
[09:54.480 --> 10:00.640]  at the third world populations that are pouring in out of the Middle East North
[10:00.640 --> 10:05.600]  Africa Syria you name it amazing people say well then I've talked to five
[10:05.600 --> 10:08.320]  different lawyers now we've got lawyers on top of that yeah this is a terrible
[10:08.320 --> 10:13.280]  suit it's it's filed in terrible place it has no bearing it has no chance it's a
[10:13.280 --> 10:19.440]  publicity stunt to just say alex jones is fake alex jones isn't real look he's
[10:19.440 --> 10:24.520]  getting sued for claiming refugees bring disease and crime next he'll say
[10:24.520 --> 10:28.720]  that cows produce milk next he'll say fish from in the ocean next he'll say
[10:28.720 --> 10:34.880]  that we breathe oxygen next he'll say the sky is blue now I want to get more to
[10:34.880 --> 10:37.040]  North Korea but I want to tell you some of the other big news is coming up
[10:37.040 --> 10:41.360]  obviously we have Trump's first 100 days he's written a big article that's up on
[10:41.360 --> 10:46.320]  info wars.com it's also on the Washington Post Trump says in his first
[10:46.320 --> 10:51.320]  hundred days he kept his promise to the American people I'd say so far he's
[10:51.320 --> 10:55.720]  gotten done about a third of what he wanted to do that is unprecedented he's
[10:55.720 --> 11:02.000]  probably so far on the issues he's followed delivered on about 80% on the
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.360]  policies he's brought forward he's gotten like 30% done of what he promised to
[11:05.360 --> 11:10.520]  do and he's been about 80% accurate in what he actually did he's gone sideways
[11:10.520 --> 11:14.000]  in quite a few different ways he's also done a lot of really great things which
[11:14.000 --> 11:17.840]  is why the globalists still want to get rid of it but it is a true statement when
[11:17.840 --> 11:23.960]  he says Trump my first hundred days just about the most successful ever and you
[11:23.960 --> 11:29.080]  know I have studied presidents going back to George Washington and I'd have to
[11:29.080 --> 11:32.120]  take George Washington and got more done in his first hundred days because they
[11:32.120 --> 11:36.560]  were first establishing the new government and founding the country
[11:36.560 --> 11:40.560]  officially before we just been the colonies battling the British for
[11:40.560 --> 11:45.160]  seven years so when that happened George Washington did more in his first
[11:45.160 --> 11:51.280]  hundred than Trump but other than George Washington if you look at devastating
[11:51.280 --> 11:55.960]  globalism killing TPP starting the renegotiation napkin get three trillion
[11:55.960 --> 12:00.840]  plus the stock market 300 billion in new jobs moving to destroy Obamacare
[12:00.840 --> 12:05.280]  signing executive orders to cripple it turning our coal systems back on killing
[12:05.280 --> 12:11.200]  the carbon tax it goes on and on and on and on re beginning to re secure the
[12:11.200 --> 12:15.360]  border attacking political correctness just announcing we're a country again
[12:15.360 --> 12:19.480]  and saying it's about the people and the power of the people and it's okay to be
[12:19.480 --> 12:23.760]  free market and the free markets better than socialism all of that culturally
[12:23.760 --> 12:30.440]  societally economically and in cold hard action is the rebirth of this country
[12:30.440 --> 12:33.440]  and I'm gonna come back and play some of his speech last night the
[12:33.440 --> 12:38.440]  Correspondence dinner response before I do that let me respond to the bad though
[12:39.880 --> 12:44.840]  going after Julian Assange and saying that's a priority to go after the
[12:44.840 --> 12:49.280]  leakers that put him in office that exposed crime going on by the Democratic
[12:49.280 --> 12:52.920]  Party and Republican establishment when Trump said if you got more stuff Wiki
[12:52.920 --> 12:57.600]  leaks release it in tweets and in speeches then by that yardstick Trump
[12:57.600 --> 13:02.040]  should have himself indicted for the leaking if he's encouraging it and it
[13:02.040 --> 13:08.560]  got him into office that is extremely disloyal there's Ron Paul Institute
[13:08.560 --> 13:12.800]  we'll get Ron Paul on soon I love Wiki leaks his candidate Trump as President
[13:12.800 --> 13:19.720]  Trump arrest Assange those are quotes this is fundamentally a sellout to
[13:19.720 --> 13:22.840]  military industrial complex when I say the military industrial complex
[13:22.840 --> 13:27.080]  I don't mean our military I don't mean our great troops I mean the corporations
[13:27.080 --> 13:32.080]  that use our country for globalism that don't want any checks and balances on
[13:32.080 --> 13:35.760]  the consolidation of power the illegal spying and the police state that's
[13:35.760 --> 13:38.920]  being used against the American people not against actual enemies of this
[13:38.920 --> 13:45.320]  Republic and so that's a huge black guy for Trump he's been talking about it for
[13:45.320 --> 13:53.520]  a month now they're starting to do it talk about a stab in the back also Trump
[13:53.520 --> 13:56.680]  comes out and says I'm a globalist and I'm a nationalist he says I believe in
[13:56.680 --> 14:01.920]  nationalism but I'll use globalism actually get forward our aims well that
[14:01.920 --> 14:05.120]  makes actually perfect sense it's the way he said it I've always said I want
[14:05.120 --> 14:10.320]  1776 worldwide I want American power through our ideas through our industry
[14:10.320 --> 14:15.040]  through our freedom through our low taxes as a tax haven as they call us as a
[14:15.040 --> 14:18.720]  dirty thing that's a good thing to have us in the middle of the world tax
[14:18.720 --> 14:21.720]  structure we used to be one of the best countries we need to be competitive
[14:21.720 --> 14:26.600]  have some of the lowest taxes we need to be an example of free market they told
[14:26.600 --> 14:30.800]  the Wall Street Journal I'm a nationalist and I'm a globalist I'm
[14:30.800 --> 14:37.120]  going to read those quotes to you here on air when we come back but again the
[14:37.120 --> 14:41.560]  way he said it it sounds like he's going back globalism the system of the
[14:41.560 --> 14:46.320]  globalist is unelected corporate world government we don't want that there are
[14:46.320 --> 14:53.560]  global systems of inner connected multivariate systems of corporations
[14:53.560 --> 14:58.520]  companies private individuals nations and cultures I don't want a single TPP
[14:58.520 --> 15:03.880]  IMF World Bank WTO structure that's unelected that transfers national power
[15:03.880 --> 15:07.520]  to it to consolidate global control because it's authoritarian and the
[15:07.520 --> 15:12.520]  globalist aims are anti-human austere and very very feudalistic in a modern
[15:12.520 --> 15:18.120]  sense but if we can have global systems of working together through nation
[15:18.120 --> 15:22.840]  states and agreements that empower the nation states to work together with
[15:22.840 --> 15:26.960]  other freer nations against nations that aren't open and free I'm all for that
[15:26.960 --> 15:31.760]  I'm not against having an interconnected world where we work together the world
[15:31.760 --> 15:37.080]  is getting smaller Trump says he'll kill NAFTA if he's not able to
[15:37.080 --> 15:40.080]  negotiate a better deal that's CNBC summer spending it that he's saying he
[15:40.080 --> 15:44.560]  won't kill NAFTA now he always said I'm gonna renegotiate it because that
[15:44.560 --> 15:48.680]  actually passed Congress he can't just kill it like TPP he did kill that because
[15:48.680 --> 15:52.440]  it was done unconstitutionally by an executive action we'll be back ladies
[15:52.440 --> 15:56.000]  and gentlemen on the other side with a bunch of clips of the president and his

[20:01.040 --> 20:06.440]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:06.440 --> 20:36.400]  I do intend to open the phones up in the second hour any issue you'd like to
[20:36.400 --> 20:42.480]  discuss on this live Sunday broadcast of course I'll be back tomorrow 11 a.m. the
[20:42.480 --> 20:46.480]  3 p.m. Central with a daytime broadcast
[20:47.400 --> 20:53.440]  President Trump just signed an executive order dealing with countries that
[20:53.440 --> 20:59.960]  subsidize their dairy farmers and also try to keep us from shipping our milk into
[20:59.960 --> 21:03.760]  their countries like Canada we're gonna be getting to that last week he signed a
[21:03.760 --> 21:08.920]  big order under national security to begin investigating how other countries
[21:08.920 --> 21:13.480]  undercut the market to flood us with cheap aluminum he's calling it a national
[21:13.480 --> 21:16.840]  security issue that we cannot even produce enough aluminum to produce our
[21:16.840 --> 21:23.720]  own aircraft much less military again Trump says I'm a nationalist and a
[21:23.720 --> 21:28.560]  globalist people say oh my gosh he sold out globalism is about multinational
[21:28.560 --> 21:34.080]  combines corporate bodies dictating different trade deals to consolidate
[21:34.080 --> 21:39.280]  control and be anti-free market fundamentally because Trump's trying
[21:39.280 --> 21:43.440]  to make the decisions under the executive branch that are his powers as a
[21:43.440 --> 21:50.120]  president for America and making fair deals that is the opposite of globalism
[21:50.120 --> 21:54.760]  which again is an authoritarian corporate global system so that's why
[21:54.760 --> 21:59.120]  despite the fact he's compromised some despite the fact that globalists have
[21:59.120 --> 22:02.760]  made record profits by him turning up the global economy they don't want that
[22:02.760 --> 22:08.440]  they want a consolidated world economy and that's why Donald Trump's announced
[22:08.440 --> 22:13.200]  a 20% import tax on Canadian softwood lumber everything they're doing is
[22:13.200 --> 22:18.400]  unfair against us so he's simply going through with line items shining
[22:18.400 --> 22:23.880]  executive orders saying you're not going to get away with that America was the
[22:23.880 --> 22:28.160]  richest most powerful nation on earth 30 years ago we were 4% of the world
[22:28.160 --> 22:33.720]  population we had 55% of the wealth now we're 5% of the population we got about
[22:33.720 --> 22:39.320]  30% of the wealth they've sold off our wealth that's what globalism is and I
[22:39.320 --> 22:43.440]  know you as long-time listeners understand that but that's why I'm
[22:43.440 --> 22:48.520]  still backing Trump he declared the eight-year war on the second amendment is
[22:48.520 --> 22:52.640]  over and he puts someone in the Supreme Court that is as conservative on the
[22:52.640 --> 22:58.680]  second amendment as Antonin Scalia total victory and he signaled he's going to
[22:58.680 --> 23:02.920]  put other people just as constitutionally conservative and strict
[23:02.920 --> 23:08.560]  constructionist as Gorsuch but there are other things that Trump was done I
[23:08.560 --> 23:12.200]  don't like like his daughter running around going to globalist meetings the
[23:12.200 --> 23:19.360]  G20 calling for open borders and more unvetted Islamist invaders some of the
[23:19.360 --> 23:27.640]  other things he's been doing but look if that's all PR whatever the problem is
[23:28.040 --> 23:31.720]  that Trump is never gonna get the globalist off his back because they
[23:31.720 --> 23:34.880]  fundamentally understand he's transferring power back to the country I
[23:34.880 --> 23:38.760]  want to be clear it doesn't mean everything he's doing is perfect it
[23:38.760 --> 23:42.160]  doesn't mean I support him on a lot of these issues where he's gone wrong and
[23:42.160 --> 23:48.160]  I'm gonna speak out against it but he's so good on so many other issues that it
[23:48.160 --> 23:54.040]  really is evil to throw fits and say we hate Trump and he's a bad guy and oh my
[23:54.040 --> 23:57.840]  gosh you know he's totally screwed us over he's not a hundred percent perfect
[23:57.840 --> 24:04.160]  he's under siege he's got every major agency ignoring his orders he can't even
[24:04.160 --> 24:07.480]  get rid of people at the IRS that were part of the whole persecution of
[24:07.480 --> 24:10.800]  conservatives the last eight years because no one's following his directives
[24:10.800 --> 24:15.760]  but he has been able with executive orders and other actions because Obama
[24:15.760 --> 24:19.360]  used executive orders to shut down our industry president Trump's use those
[24:19.360 --> 24:23.360]  executive orders to turn the industry back on and that's the most important
[24:23.360 --> 24:30.360]  thing is getting the economy going again if we don't get the economy going
[24:30.360 --> 24:35.640]  again we are facing a worldwide financial calamity the likes of which the
[24:35.640 --> 24:38.960]  world has not seen in a long long time and you notice you've got all these so
[24:38.960 --> 24:44.800]  called liberals running around who are the most rich people in the world rich
[24:44.800 --> 24:49.960]  wildly more wealthy than Donald Trump the apples of the world's the Microsofts
[24:49.960 --> 24:55.800]  of the world's and they are the ones pushing austerity and people being poor
[24:55.800 --> 24:59.560]  and shutting down the factories and making the world basically an
[24:59.560 --> 25:04.440]  anti-human system they're the ones that don't like Trump moving forward to have
[25:04.440 --> 25:08.840]  tax incentives for farmers in rural communities because they want you part of
[25:08.840 --> 25:13.600]  their big factory farm system they want to get rid of the little guy and Trump
[25:13.600 --> 25:17.240]  is doing the opposite and it's making the rich people even richer but again the
[25:17.240 --> 25:23.920]  elite want a consolidation apples cash hordes set to top 250 billion dollars
[25:23.920 --> 25:31.440]  tax-free outside the United States that is out of Wall Street Journal CNBC Bill
[25:31.440 --> 25:36.200]  Gates could be the world's first trillionaire but he wants higher taxes on
[25:36.200 --> 25:41.320]  the middle class Europe investors bid bye-bye to political jitters and begin
[25:41.320 --> 25:48.680]  buying they've tried to kill the Trump rally it's not working so many
[25:48.680 --> 25:53.120]  incredibly exciting things are happening so I want to be positive about the
[25:53.120 --> 25:59.640]  positive stuff Trump's done 80% positive
[26:00.160 --> 26:05.580]  absolutely transferring power back to the country back to the people but the
[26:05.580 --> 26:13.080]  20% he's doing is basically shows he's being more and more captured by the deep
[26:13.080 --> 26:17.520]  state as dr. Paul Craig Roberts warned in an article at info wars calm last
[26:17.520 --> 26:21.960]  Friday and that's what scares me because he was basically a hundred percent dead
[26:21.960 --> 26:27.520]  on until day 70 the last 30 days he went from going perfectly straight over
[26:27.520 --> 26:31.200]  delivering where I just couldn't believe it the first 70 days and then suddenly
[26:31.200 --> 26:36.640]  70 days in they shake up Bannon gets basically removed as the top advisor
[26:36.640 --> 26:45.440]  Trump begins to move into other issues and he starts turning a few degrees but
[26:45.440 --> 26:49.200]  you turn a few degrees and stay on that for a year or two you'll be you'll be
[26:49.200 --> 26:52.560]  right back where Hillary Clinton was or where a Barack Obama was or where
[26:52.560 --> 26:57.960]  George W. Bush was but you know Trump's for real not just by his actions but by
[26:57.960 --> 27:04.920]  the abject total and complete unbelievable panic that is taking place in
[27:04.920 --> 27:08.960]  mainstream news with them just out to get him and the correspondence dinner
[27:08.960 --> 27:13.920]  admitting their mission was destroy him for journalists at annual dinner serves
[27:13.920 --> 27:21.360]  up catharsis and resolve and it says quote to topple the presidency I mean
[27:21.360 --> 27:26.160]  they admit it and they see me as low-hanging fruit they admit this they
[27:26.160 --> 27:31.680]  see you the listeners through this broadcast as the Americana spirit of
[27:31.680 --> 27:37.280]  America that could rise at any time they fear you they fear that spirit they
[27:37.280 --> 27:41.480]  fear that energy they fear that love of God that love of decency that love of
[27:41.480 --> 27:48.200]  prosperity they fear what you have and so they're looking who's the most
[27:48.200 --> 27:53.120]  prominent person giving vent to this having guessed on empowering the people
[27:53.120 --> 27:59.440]  they're empowering him Alex Jones destroy him shut him down shut him up and now
[27:59.440 --> 28:03.320]  they admit it everywhere did his advertisers kick him off Google have
[28:03.320 --> 28:08.080]  Google delisting all of its come out whistleblowers gave us the intel
[28:08.080 --> 28:13.360]  shabbani lawsuit from the Federal Reserve board member of New York running
[28:13.360 --> 28:16.520]  the shadow government that's the Federal Reserve of New York that Trump's trying
[28:16.520 --> 28:24.600]  to replace literally suing me with George Soros's law firm that he founded as
[28:24.600 --> 28:31.480]  the founding client in the 1980s in New York don't read it a law firm suing me
[28:31.480 --> 28:37.240]  that the person suing me the Islamists from Turkey is a member of the New York
[28:37.240 --> 28:41.320]  Federal Reserve board incredible power that's that that is the shadow
[28:41.320 --> 28:46.920]  government and then the law firms George Soros why is that because they understand
[28:46.920 --> 28:50.880]  we've got their number and they want to shut us down because we're a focal point
[28:50.880 --> 28:54.080]  and they want to intimidate everybody else ladies and gentlemen they've
[28:54.080 --> 28:59.120]  miscalculated and I'll explain why on the other side although conservative
[28:59.120 --> 29:03.360]  commentator and culture backed out of showing up to her already canceled
[29:03.360 --> 29:07.160]  speech at Berkeley that didn't stop freedom-loving Americans from
[29:07.160 --> 29:12.120]  conducting a large First Amendment rally in its place prominent social media
[29:12.120 --> 29:17.560]  icon such as Gavin McInnes Lauren Southern based stickman baked Alaska
[29:17.560 --> 29:22.040]  Brittany Pettibone and Faith Goldie showed up to support free speech and
[29:22.040 --> 29:26.720]  gave speeches reports that the Berkeley police did their job in protecting the
[29:26.720 --> 29:31.600]  peace have come in and apparently a total of six anti-fog protesters were
[29:31.600 --> 29:36.720]  arrested two for resisting arrest one for a drug violation and another for
[29:36.720 --> 29:41.240]  possessing a weapon two more arrests were made earlier in the day for
[29:41.240 --> 29:46.120]  possession of a knife and obstructing an officer and wearing a mask to evade
[29:46.120 --> 29:50.600]  police despite these arrests the protest remained peaceful and dialogue

[33:01.520 --> 33:08.040]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show Pelosi didn't remember the president
[33:08.040 --> 33:16.000]  was again this is a island that edits
[33:16.000 --> 33:25.320]  widest level is what 12 miles from shore to shore and at a smallest level or
[33:25.320 --> 33:39.480]  smallest location it's seven miles between one shore and the other is that
[33:39.480 --> 33:44.920]  correct I don't have the exact dimensions but to your point sir I think
[33:44.920 --> 33:54.200]  Guam is a small island. My fear is that the whole island will become so overly
[33:54.200 --> 34:08.600]  populated that it will tip over and capsize I stand here as a freed slave
[34:08.600 --> 34:13.960]  we've seen nothing that we can work but I can work with President Bush on and
[34:13.960 --> 34:19.040]  disappointed because I thought that there might be some interest because of
[34:19.040 --> 34:26.280]  what he said in the campaign what are we going to do how can a president who is
[34:26.280 --> 34:30.600]  acting in the manner that he's acting whether he's talking about the travel
[34:30.600 --> 34:35.520]  ban the way that he's targeting Muslims or whether he's talking about his
[34:35.520 --> 34:41.520]  relationship to Putin and the Kremlin and knowing that they have hacked our
[34:41.520 --> 34:50.520]  the triple C and DNC and knowing that he is responsible for supplying the bombs
[34:50.520 --> 34:58.560]  that killed innocent children and families and what is a lapo yeah in a
[34:58.560 --> 35:14.080]  level the fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin while Putin is
[35:14.080 --> 35:30.160]  continuing to advance into Korea stop it I'm Alex Jones your host that's from a
[35:30.160 --> 35:34.440]  few months ago Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters in the same press conference
[35:34.440 --> 35:39.160]  thinking that Putin had invaded Korea not north or south but Korea never
[35:39.160 --> 35:44.280]  happened in history Russian us share some border with North Korea and that
[35:44.280 --> 35:48.040]  also George W. Bush was still in office that was eight plus years ago that
[35:48.040 --> 35:57.000]  George Walker Bush the 43rd president was in office then it was 44 was
[35:57.000 --> 36:01.400]  Barack Hussein Obama he was in office eight years and the number 45 is Donald
[36:01.400 --> 36:08.400]  John Trump he was sworn in January 20th 2017 I expect mainstream media will say
[36:08.400 --> 36:12.520]  that's a conspiracy theory just like everything we talk about they say as a
[36:12.520 --> 36:17.880]  conspiracy theory we told you six months ago that we're worried that Jared
[36:17.880 --> 36:21.960]  Kushner was bought off by the Communist Chinese that was during the campaign and
[36:21.960 --> 36:24.640]  then of course it came out a few months ago in mainstream news we had guessed on
[36:24.640 --> 36:28.680]  about it and that was in the New York Times earlier this week or last week
[36:28.680 --> 36:34.160]  something else we were right about but Pelosi not knowing that George W. Bush
[36:34.160 --> 36:39.920]  has been gone for eight years gave another talk interview house minority
[36:39.920 --> 36:44.360]  leader Nancy Pelosi during an interview early Sunday accidentally referred to
[36:44.360 --> 36:49.520]  President Trump as former president George W. Bush after the mistake on ABC's
[36:49.520 --> 36:53.640]  this week Pelosi quickly corrected herself so at least she corrected herself
[36:53.640 --> 36:57.480]  this time and even the Democrats keep saying you need to step down you need to
[36:57.480 --> 37:03.160]  step down you and Maxine Waters are just out of your minds you're out of your
[37:03.160 --> 37:08.960]  minds I mean Maxine Waters says that Putin gives Trump terms like drain the
[37:08.960 --> 37:15.480]  swamp and crooked Hillary as if Trump can't think this up or you or I can't
[37:16.160 --> 37:22.280]  when she's corrupt she's part of the swamp so this is how stupid they think
[37:22.280 --> 37:27.840]  we are but here's the latest clip he means winning for the American people
[37:27.840 --> 37:33.240]  that either we win or whoever wins understands the priorities of the
[37:33.240 --> 37:38.440]  American people and they are not with President Bush excuse me so sorry
[37:38.440 --> 37:44.840]  president that you're president again but praying for the day the president
[37:44.840 --> 37:49.040]  we worked and so you ask the question how would I work with a Republican
[37:49.040 --> 37:54.360]  president the way we were that's good so the woman has a plastic face she's got
[37:54.360 --> 37:59.520]  like a rubber wig on she's a reanimated corpse toddling around and she needs to
[37:59.520 --> 38:03.480]  be in a nursing home and that's what's so dangerous about these people is it
[38:03.480 --> 38:07.200]  the I'm not against old folks a lot old folks are smarter than I am and sharper
[38:07.200 --> 38:10.880]  than I am but she clearly is not one of those old folks she's never been that
[38:10.880 --> 38:15.120]  sharp she's a rubber stamp for corporate interest and she's the person
[38:15.120 --> 38:18.720]  trying to direct this war against the American people she's the one that
[38:18.720 --> 38:24.200]  reportedly had meetings with the outgoing ahead of the Justice Department
[38:24.200 --> 38:29.640]  Lynch trying to get me arrested last year when Trump was only president-elect
[38:29.640 --> 38:34.760]  and then her daughter goes on TV the day after I report this and says Alex
[38:34.760 --> 38:39.880]  Jones it's death-threading me I want him arrested and I was like oh my gosh my
[38:39.880 --> 38:46.040]  source was correct that was Larry Nichols I never death-threaded that lady
[38:46.040 --> 38:51.040]  these people are crazy they want authoritarianism they're ready to do
[38:51.040 --> 38:54.400]  it that's why all over the news they're saying kill Trump kill Trump and then
[38:54.400 --> 38:59.960]  they never get in trouble I've got the correspondence dinner here we're
[38:59.960 --> 39:05.400]  journalists an annual dinner serve up catharsis and resolve out of the San
[39:05.400 --> 39:11.120]  Jose Mercury times and the New York Times also carry the same story my
[39:11.120 --> 39:15.800]  Michael M. Grumsbaum and it says they have the resolve to bring him down what's
[39:15.800 --> 39:20.800]  the exact quote here I want to play some clips of this to bring him down to
[39:20.800 --> 39:26.080]  topple a presidency that they have the resolve to topple the presidency and
[39:26.080 --> 39:30.920]  then anyone else they see wearing a Trump hat or wanting to have lower taxes
[39:30.920 --> 39:35.560]  we're dehumanized we deserve to be beaten up we need to be sued we need to
[39:35.560 --> 39:39.240]  be attacked we need to be kicked off the internet because well we're just not
[39:39.240 --> 39:44.320]  human I went and saw a very powerful movie last night with my wife and my
[39:44.320 --> 39:49.960]  son and that was the promise with a Christian Bale and others about the
[39:49.960 --> 39:54.320]  Armenian genocide that was over a million and a half people now if you look
[39:54.320 --> 39:58.120]  at the historical maps since the Muslims took over the Christian country
[39:58.120 --> 40:04.040]  that's Turkey today and Constantinople changed over to Istanbul you will notice
[40:04.040 --> 40:07.960]  that at first they only conquered some of the major cities and then over the
[40:07.960 --> 40:12.000]  next few hundred years they killed almost all the Christians or drove them
[40:12.000 --> 40:16.680]  out of Turkey the men they would kill the woman they'd keep and use in slave
[40:16.680 --> 40:22.200]  harems the Christians had kind of a civilizing effect on the Muslims so as
[40:22.200 --> 40:25.840]  one of the more civilized countries for Muslims and became the new capital of
[40:25.840 --> 40:30.000]  the Ottoman Empire and the Muslim you know religious political system that it
[40:30.000 --> 40:36.280]  is but you watch that movie it's so accurate based on real battles real
[40:36.280 --> 40:39.680]  things that happened them killing little kids shooting them in the back of the
[40:39.680 --> 40:46.560]  head this is what the Muslims do and the Armenians were just a few Christians
[40:46.560 --> 40:51.240]  left in very rural mountainous areas rural mountainous coastal areas very
[40:51.240 --> 40:55.440]  small little enclaves not allowed to have their own businesses not allowed to
[40:55.440 --> 40:59.480]  operate in the rest of the country as the Muslims slowly over the hundreds of
[40:59.480 --> 41:05.280]  years killed them and other Christian minority groups and finally they were
[41:05.280 --> 41:13.480]  killing all Christians left in the country of Turkey in World War one now
[41:13.480 --> 41:20.680]  the young Turks will not identify funded by Soros groups funded by Al Gore
[41:20.680 --> 41:24.960]  funded by Al Jazeera funded by Qatar this is all on record they will never
[41:24.960 --> 41:28.880]  admit the Armenian genocide that's totally admitted documented by the
[41:28.880 --> 41:32.920]  Associated Press photos you name it when it happened one of the reasons the
[41:32.920 --> 41:38.720]  United States came in on World War one totally documented the young Turks was
[41:38.720 --> 41:41.800]  the name of the young political party that called for the extermination of
[41:41.800 --> 41:46.760]  Christians namely Armenians the young Turks were the young gangs that wore
[41:46.760 --> 41:50.680]  the red fezzes you see in the movie so well done you everyone's got to go see
[41:50.680 --> 41:55.760]  it beating people attacking people killing them but it began like brown
[41:55.760 --> 42:00.440]  shirts in the 1930s in Nazi Germany it began with the young gangs going out and
[42:00.440 --> 42:04.280]  burning the shops and beating people up and pushing the Armenians out of the
[42:04.280 --> 42:07.920]  cities that were left there into the rural area then it was the men the
[42:07.920 --> 42:12.600]  intellectuals the newspaper writers the doctors the leaders they were arrested
[42:12.600 --> 42:16.400]  as traitors and killed in the next two years then it was all the males that were
[42:16.400 --> 42:20.400]  young then it was all the males then it was all the women and they're coming
[42:20.400 --> 42:24.240]  into the town this is historical this all happened they're coming into this
[42:24.240 --> 42:30.280]  rural mountain town on a coastline to to kill who's left in the movie all
[42:30.280 --> 42:34.640]  happened documented historical all the characters they're all real people it's

[47:40.880 --> 47:48.120]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us I'm
[47:48.120 --> 47:52.200]  gonna open the phones up in the next hour on any issue I've raised any topic
[47:52.200 --> 47:58.560]  what do you think of Trump's speech in Harrisburg PA I thought it was extremely
[47:58.560 --> 48:02.000]  powerful the Washington Post actually got it right saying that it electrified
[48:02.000 --> 48:05.960]  and captivated and enchanted the crowd what do you think about the North Korea
[48:05.960 --> 48:10.640]  situation what do you think about the admission with Stephen Colbert attacking
[48:10.640 --> 48:15.680]  me every night for the last two weeks the other major shows lying about me the
[48:15.680 --> 48:20.240]  news shows lying press following me around everywhere twisting information
[48:20.240 --> 48:25.680]  why is info wars under such mega attack well we know why we're promoting
[48:25.680 --> 48:32.040]  nationalism free market capitalism local sovereign control and comparing that
[48:32.040 --> 48:38.320]  to unelected globalism is very easy and very popular and they know we're
[48:38.320 --> 48:43.200]  exponentially growing so they want to shut us down as a way to intimidate
[48:43.200 --> 48:46.720]  everybody else and as a way to set a precedent as I said earlier first
[48:46.720 --> 48:51.320]  authoritarian movements shut down the independent press that is criticizing the
[48:51.320 --> 48:55.720]  power structure then it begins to actually persecute and go after people
[48:55.720 --> 48:59.760]  claiming their spies are involved in espionage they admit in the news three
[48:59.760 --> 49:03.320]  months ago congressional hearings I'm under criminal investigation for actually
[49:03.320 --> 49:07.400]  being a Russian spy should I play that clip again I know it's ridiculous what
[49:07.400 --> 49:12.280]  is happening State Department Pentagon operations the average person in the
[49:12.280 --> 49:15.320]  military is great by the way most folks the Pentagon are the people that got
[49:15.320 --> 49:18.560]  Trump elected they're the ones that leaked to WikiLeaks but the people
[49:18.560 --> 49:24.320]  running it are bad news the stay-behind networks the deep state operatives the
[49:24.320 --> 49:29.320]  shadow government that won't leave why are they coming after us look at Le Pen
[49:29.320 --> 49:36.400]  Francis Le Pen on offensive with a vote a week away she's now ahead even in
[49:36.400 --> 49:41.560]  their twisted polls against her competitor in the runoff Le Pen's euro
[49:41.560 --> 49:47.680]  contortions underlined French reluctance to exit can Le Pen beat Marron
[49:47.680 --> 49:53.320]  Macron in the French election despite losing in the first round this is a
[49:53.320 --> 49:57.280]  big deal ladies and gentlemen and even if she loses think of a nationalist
[49:57.280 --> 50:02.000]  anti-globalist that close to winning that's why they want to punish her she's
[50:02.000 --> 50:06.600]  under criminal indictment and they're trying to disqualify her right now and
[50:06.600 --> 50:11.440]  are saying even if she wins they're going to arrest her she's a member of the EU
[50:11.440 --> 50:15.160]  Parliament so she had immunity oh yeah the EU gave itself immunity but now
[50:15.160 --> 50:21.840]  they're trying to strip that immunity and have successfully done so again they
[50:21.840 --> 50:26.480]  tried to kill Nigel Farage three times in a plane crash two car accidents the
[50:26.480 --> 50:30.480]  police said it was foul play in one of the car accidents with the lug nuts all
[50:30.480 --> 50:34.480]  taken off on his car to where he got up to 50 miles an hour and the lug nuts
[50:34.480 --> 50:43.840]  came off this is what's happening this is what's unfolding and they're coming
[50:43.840 --> 50:48.040]  after everyone to say hey you may have a popular vision you may have something
[50:48.040 --> 50:53.480]  the people want you may be you know you know promoting liberty and freedom we

[59:50.960 --> 59:56.480]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[59:56.480 --> 1:00:20.840]  you know I like Christian Bailen he's a really good actor I liked it back when I
[1:00:20.840 --> 1:00:24.440]  was a kid watching him in the remake of Charlton Heston a treasure Island and
[1:00:24.440 --> 1:00:29.800]  it's also strange we were born within a month of each other in 1974 we're the
[1:00:29.800 --> 1:00:35.440]  same Chinese I guess and zodiac signs or whatever I'm not really putting stock
[1:00:35.440 --> 1:00:39.800]  in that stuff but it's interesting but Christian Bail likes to play these big
[1:00:39.800 --> 1:00:45.000]  anti-tirent heroes in movies so he was in a film that I saw last night with my
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:50.600]  son and wife that I thought was excellent very historical and very very well
[1:00:50.600 --> 1:00:54.760]  done called The Promise and in a moment I'm gonna play that trailer but look at
[1:00:54.760 --> 1:00:58.640]  this article for the London Independent and reportedly he's attacked me he's
[1:00:58.640 --> 1:01:02.120]  attacked Cernovich he's attacked others and some Daily Beast articles and things
[1:01:02.120 --> 1:01:06.720]  that were terrible people we're the post truth really buddy well I'm being
[1:01:06.720 --> 1:01:10.160]  persecuted I have the state you know openly in the media saying take my
[1:01:10.160 --> 1:01:15.440]  children away from my views and the media and the corporate minions and
[1:01:15.440 --> 1:01:20.040]  the Stephen Colbert's the fake news reporters misrepresent what I say and
[1:01:20.040 --> 1:01:23.760]  what I believe and then people like you come out and attack us here it is
[1:01:23.760 --> 1:01:28.240]  Christian Bail on Donald Trump's dictatorship for dummies he says we live
[1:01:28.240 --> 1:01:32.800]  in a post truth era that's what the New York Times the Washington Post say that
[1:01:32.800 --> 1:01:37.000]  democracy dies in the dark Mr. Bail Trump's far from perfect but he's
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:40.320]  bringing the sovereignty back to this country and the talking point that he's
[1:01:40.320 --> 1:01:45.280]  a dictator is a fraud and you're the ones in Hollywood criticizing him for not
[1:01:45.280 --> 1:01:49.720]  wanting to bring Muslims in from seven unvetted countries like Somalia
[1:01:49.720 --> 1:01:53.520]  Sudan and Libya that are failed states where they still sell women into
[1:01:53.520 --> 1:01:57.920]  slavery and where they kill Christians and others you were just in a powerful
[1:01:57.920 --> 1:02:03.320]  film the promise about the Armenian genocide where the young Turks was the
[1:02:03.320 --> 1:02:06.320]  name of the political party went around murdering and killing people and
[1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:10.240]  finally the government joined in during World War one killing the Christians
[1:02:10.240 --> 1:02:14.360]  that's what Muslims have done in every country that's what's happening in Syria
[1:02:14.360 --> 1:02:17.440]  right now with the rebels our government's been backing until Trump got
[1:02:17.440 --> 1:02:23.040]  in so for you to call Trump a dictator for trying to stop unvetted Islamists
[1:02:23.040 --> 1:02:28.080]  coming in when you just starred in a movie about the true extermination of a
[1:02:28.080 --> 1:02:35.520]  million and a half Christian Armenians is unbelievable you my friend are the one
[1:02:35.520 --> 1:02:39.120]  that want to pose as a hero with some historical thing that really happened
[1:02:39.120 --> 1:02:43.480]  but in the real world actually aid Turkey that's threatening to burn down
[1:02:43.480 --> 1:02:46.920]  Europe and saying they'll have an Islamist's takeover and a jihad of Europe
[1:02:46.920 --> 1:02:51.240]  doesn't open its borders to Turkey and submit to them when Ergun is part two of
[1:02:51.240 --> 1:02:55.680]  the young Turks so learn some history and stop acting like a pseudo-intellectual
[1:02:55.680 --> 1:03:00.560]  fop stop being a fake liberal Christian male okay you you're a disgrace to
[1:03:00.560 --> 1:03:04.480]  yourself and you're following Hollywood talking points when Hollywood's been
[1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:08.480]  bought by the communist Chinese and the globalist and is an anti-American
[1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:13.760]  anti-human illiberal institution now here's the trailer for the promise

[1:19:33.800 --> 1:19:38.680]  cooking but you use the bones for strength for the outside structure full
[1:19:38.680 --> 1:19:42.000]  of minerals and Kiko factors to the marrow that produces the blood for the
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:46.760]  body this is the engine of the life essence I'm a long way from the caveman
[1:19:46.760 --> 1:19:50.680]  my ancestors were but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that
[1:19:50.680 --> 1:19:53.680]  made us what we were and this is a big part of it I know you're going to want
[1:19:53.680 --> 1:19:57.480]  to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself and for life calm
[1:19:57.480 --> 1:19:59.680]  today
[1:20:01.480 --> 1:20:06.920]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:20:06.920 --> 1:20:08.920]  you
[1:20:19.760 --> 1:20:26.800]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[1:20:31.360 --> 1:20:35.440]  all right we are back live I've got some more clips of Trump's powerful speech
[1:20:35.440 --> 1:20:39.240]  coming up and I want to go to your phone calls right now I want to go to
[1:20:39.240 --> 1:20:43.880]  Carlos first in Maryland and David and Bill and Karen the dentist then Shane
[1:20:43.880 --> 1:20:48.880]  and a bunch of others that I see holding there it's wide open phones any
[1:20:48.880 --> 1:20:52.680]  topic you want to discuss Carlos wants to talk about will Syria lead to more
[1:20:52.680 --> 1:20:57.560]  false flags yeah the Islamists have been caught at least red-handed twice
[1:20:57.560 --> 1:21:01.640]  launching false flags with chemicals that's mainstream news that's admitted
[1:21:01.640 --> 1:21:05.840]  and then another three times it looked like they did it the UN has even said
[1:21:05.840 --> 1:21:11.800]  that but the media just immediately said it was the Syrian government a month
[1:21:11.800 --> 1:21:15.960]  ago or whatever and then we saw the strike by Trump that kind of legitimizes
[1:21:15.960 --> 1:21:19.920]  false flags I mean jumping right into believing they did it and people say
[1:21:19.920 --> 1:21:24.320]  well it was for China to look decisive and they hadn't given up their chemicals
[1:21:24.320 --> 1:21:29.720]  yet so Trump did right I want to support the president but I am worried
[1:21:29.720 --> 1:21:33.160]  because it was even the British ambassador that said out after it happened
[1:21:33.160 --> 1:21:37.920]  that this will only encourage the Islamists to stage more events so if
[1:21:37.920 --> 1:21:43.440]  they've been caught before aren't they the suspects now but he's gotten Trump's
[1:21:43.440 --> 1:21:47.560]  gotten really tough on Syria he's gotten really tough on Russia he's really been
[1:21:47.560 --> 1:21:51.800]  pushed by the media into doing that when Syria and Russia haven't done anything
[1:21:51.800 --> 1:21:57.040]  to us but it's a good question what do you think Carlos
[1:21:57.040 --> 1:22:05.160]  can you hear me Carlos yes I can yes welcome back I see that you're back on
[1:22:05.160 --> 1:22:09.960]  top form thank you thank you brother go ahead well you mentioned continuity of
[1:22:09.960 --> 1:22:15.960]  governance and you are concerned about that and he made me think of a scenario
[1:22:15.960 --> 1:22:21.480]  which is troubling I don't know I don't know if you're aware but the US nuclear
[1:22:21.480 --> 1:22:26.840]  weapons are being guarded by an Israeli company that's the US arsenal the most
[1:22:26.840 --> 1:22:31.160]  sensitive nuclear power and weapons storage facilities in the United States
[1:22:31.160 --> 1:22:36.240]  are in the hands of a company called megal out of Israel now I have all
[1:22:36.240 --> 1:22:39.720]  respect for Israel there's no no problem with that sure I'm aware of that it's a
[1:22:39.720 --> 1:22:43.040]  little weird that Israel is one of the main groups that guards the nukes that
[1:22:43.040 --> 1:22:49.640]  is a fact they also have the contract for the caller ID numbers so basically the
[1:22:49.640 --> 1:22:55.640]  the the digital internet number it's the same thing for phones the DNS number for
[1:22:55.640 --> 1:22:59.320]  phone lines and are listening to all the phones as well so it's it's very
[1:22:59.320 --> 1:23:04.040]  strange yeah Jimmy Spanford wrote about that as a matter of fact the NSA has a
[1:23:04.040 --> 1:23:10.040]  contract where they sent all unfiltered data to Israel as automatically as part
[1:23:10.040 --> 1:23:15.680]  of an agreement he wrote about that in the New York Times on September 16 2014
[1:23:15.680 --> 1:23:20.800]  what I'm basically saying is not anything other than if today because of
[1:23:20.800 --> 1:23:25.280]  their reaction that President Trump took with regards to Syria and his reaction
[1:23:25.280 --> 1:23:30.320]  to children being killed etc. and the quick reaction that he took what if
[1:23:30.320 --> 1:23:36.720]  today or tomorrow the day after there was a let's say an detonation of a dirty
[1:23:36.720 --> 1:23:40.840]  bomb in the United States and he was blamed immediately by the New York Times
[1:23:40.840 --> 1:23:48.000]  in the media on to say South Korea then then what would happen I mean you can't
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:52.840]  just react to any you're right very dangerous very dangerous precedent's
[1:23:52.840 --> 1:23:58.160]  been set where the media just says Germany did it Russia did it Mexico did
[1:23:58.160 --> 1:24:02.520]  America did it and then you're just allowed to bomb him a day later with no
[1:24:02.520 --> 1:24:07.520]  proof that you're absolutely on target there and that's so so what do we do
[1:24:07.520 --> 1:24:12.560]  about it because here's all you have to know Carlos when we saw the Islamists
[1:24:12.560 --> 1:24:17.240]  this run over people at London Bridge or run over people at Big Bend or shoot
[1:24:17.240 --> 1:24:23.000]  people in Paris last week or shoot people in Sweden or shoot people in
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:27.600]  Brussels Belgium or run over people in Stockholm Sweden you don't see the blood
[1:24:27.600 --> 1:24:33.520]  you don't see the bodies but when when the kids get nerve-gassed you see it and
[1:24:33.520 --> 1:24:38.160]  we're told that it was a sod so I'm asking why were we shown that but we're
[1:24:38.160 --> 1:24:42.080]  not shown what the Islamists do ever because they're waving the bloody shirt
[1:24:42.080 --> 1:24:47.880]  to get us in a war yes and that the conceptual mistake I have absolute
[1:24:47.880 --> 1:24:54.240]  confidence in President Trump you cannot imagine that I know that this man is
[1:24:54.240 --> 1:24:58.360]  the man of his time there will be books written about President Trump for a long
[1:24:58.360 --> 1:25:03.040]  time to come I'm not concerned about that what I am concerned about is that he
[1:25:03.040 --> 1:25:11.720]  will be tricked he will be tricked into reacting President Kennedy was advised to
[1:25:11.720 --> 1:25:19.400]  nuke Cuba it was advice advice advice and he held back instead he said Martin
[1:25:19.400 --> 1:25:24.920]  Luther King to negotiate the private agreement with you know the Soviets so
[1:25:24.920 --> 1:25:28.560]  that they would remove the missiles from Turkey you're right we don't we don't
[1:25:28.560 --> 1:25:32.240]  need a nuclear war at Curtis LeMay and General LL elements or the chairman of
[1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:35.360]  the Joint Chiefs wanted to start a nuclear war the Russia by attacking US
[1:25:35.360 --> 1:25:39.160]  cities claiming that Cubans had done it by staging plastic explosive attacks
[1:25:39.160 --> 1:25:44.840]  mass shootings at movie theaters rock and roll disco tax you name it and that
[1:25:44.840 --> 1:25:51.520]  has been declassified in 1999 operation Northwoods and Kennedy said no so then
[1:25:51.520 --> 1:25:55.720]  they sabotage his own operation which we've now seen them doing to Trump going
[1:25:55.720 --> 1:25:59.600]  after ISIS they sabotage his own operation to Bay of Pigs and made that
[1:25:59.600 --> 1:26:03.880]  fail to set up the president which just shows how criminal elements of the CIA
[1:26:03.880 --> 1:26:07.960]  continue to plague this country but now there are reportedly more and more good
[1:26:07.960 --> 1:26:10.920]  elements inside the intelligence agencies they're trying to stop this
[1:26:10.920 --> 1:26:15.760]  thank you so much but the bad elements want to go after Assange who have the
[1:26:15.760 --> 1:26:19.600]  CIA leak him intel to get Trump elected so I don't know why he's now double
[1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:25.240]  crossing it just absolutely concerns me let's go ahead and talk to David in
[1:26:25.240 --> 1:26:29.320]  New Hampshire David thanks for holding her on the air
[1:26:30.440 --> 1:26:35.040]  hey Dave how you doing you want to talk from New Hampshire yeah there was just
[1:26:35.040 --> 1:26:39.280]  like a little cutout that just happened yeah I want to can you hear me I sure
[1:26:39.280 --> 1:26:45.480]  can I thank you sir I just wanted to talk about Trump and about how I'm a
[1:26:45.480 --> 1:26:48.560]  little disappointed I'm a little disappointed in Trump but most of them
[1:26:48.560 --> 1:26:53.320]  disappointed in myself and the reason why I'm disappointed in myself is knowing
[1:26:53.320 --> 1:26:56.560]  all the information that I know knowing about false flags knowing about the
[1:26:56.560 --> 1:27:02.920]  deep state why did I indeed fall for the trap which was so cleverly played upon
[1:27:02.920 --> 1:27:11.360]  all of us and I voted for Trump Trump is the best option by far way better than
[1:27:11.360 --> 1:27:19.360]  Hillary by a mile but as the last caller said Carlos I would say Trump will
[1:27:19.360 --> 1:27:23.720]  have books written about him for decades to come he is probably the most
[1:27:23.720 --> 1:27:28.240]  clever and most manipulative president that we've had since FDR but in that
[1:27:28.240 --> 1:27:34.800]  same vein he is just as dangerous as FDR dangerous in the fact that he is so
[1:27:34.800 --> 1:27:40.000]  good at dividing conquer we the Trump supporters are looking at the media as
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:43.920]  the enemy that the media is calling him the enemy the media is calling us the
[1:27:43.920 --> 1:27:48.120]  enemy the media is calling you the enemy we're looking at you and wondering
[1:27:48.120 --> 1:27:52.440]  if you're the enemy you know some some Alex people who watch your show or you
[1:27:52.440 --> 1:27:56.440]  know who done that for two years for years all of us are looking at each other
[1:27:56.440 --> 1:27:59.720]  and we don't know what is up and what is down sure well let me let me break down
[1:27:59.720 --> 1:28:04.040]  what's up and what's down and I appreciate your call you can judge what
[1:28:04.040 --> 1:28:09.320]  I've done by the fruits of the Liberty Movement globalism and trouble but
[1:28:09.320 --> 1:28:12.400]  regardless you know you're good so you should take political action to be
[1:28:12.400 --> 1:28:15.680]  involved we're devastating globalist we're exposing their unelected
[1:28:15.680 --> 1:28:21.920]  unaccountable planetary system you think they like that they hate it they
[1:28:21.920 --> 1:28:27.200]  absolutely hate it Trump is basically taking over their system that's why
[1:28:27.200 --> 1:28:33.680]  they legitimately hate him he's doing so much good that we can be excited about
[1:28:33.680 --> 1:28:41.120]  but then he's doing some bad things and but but to not differentiate that and
[1:28:41.120 --> 1:28:45.600]  to say we got conned by Trump we didn't think Trump would be perfect but we knew
[1:28:45.600 --> 1:28:48.880]  he was better than Hillary we just got a great Supreme Court justice the
[1:28:48.880 --> 1:28:54.280]  economy's coming back nationalism's here sovereignty so many good things I

[1:33:50.880 --> 1:33:56.240]  played us I feel like a fool maybe even you play this Alex I feel like a fool
[1:33:56.240 --> 1:34:03.640]  the caller said for voting for Trump Trump has over delivered on his Supreme
[1:34:03.640 --> 1:34:08.560]  Court pick on the stock market on sovereignty on pulling out of the TPP
[1:34:08.560 --> 1:34:14.920]  on bringing back all these jobs on moving to renegotiate NAFTA and GATT on

[1:34:27.040 --> 1:34:32.520]  American president and then the caller was saying well he's divided and
[1:34:32.520 --> 1:34:38.240]  conquered us David Gergen has come out advisor to five presidents and said
[1:34:38.240 --> 1:34:42.200]  Trump is the most divisive president he's ever seen well you got the media at
[1:34:42.200 --> 1:34:46.000]  the correspondence dinner saying their job from the podium is to topple a
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  presidency and to bring down Trump that's the headline for journalist annual
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:57.720]  dinner serves up catharsis and resolve to topple the president their radical
[1:34:57.720 --> 1:35:01.600]  saying kill the president topple the president go after his supporters beat
[1:35:01.600 --> 1:35:10.920]  them up ban them off the internet that's what the New York Times is saying and
[1:35:10.920 --> 1:35:17.240]  that's okay and then Trump says the media is the enemy the the globalist
[1:35:17.240 --> 1:35:21.400]  corporate media is the enemy I've experienced this the last three weeks total
[1:35:21.400 --> 1:35:27.680]  attack total lies I'm in a deposition they say what's the name of all your
[1:35:27.680 --> 1:35:32.120]  children's teachers I name all of them but two then it's in court that I don't
[1:35:32.120 --> 1:35:35.720]  know the name of the nanny I say that's not true it's the teachers pull up the
[1:35:35.720 --> 1:35:39.080]  transcript they pull it up it's two teachers it goes on Colbert I don't know
[1:35:39.080 --> 1:35:43.720]  the names of my children you know that's just comedy no people then believe it and
[1:35:43.720 --> 1:35:49.000]  they run headlines everywhere in the news doesn't know the names of his children
[1:35:50.280 --> 1:35:55.840]  I had a press conference Friday could basically tell the media what a bunch of
[1:35:55.840 --> 1:36:01.240]  liars they were that was a headline of it in post Alex Jones calls a press
[1:36:01.240 --> 1:36:09.520]  conference on the media they suck I did and they wouldn't get anything I said or
[1:36:09.520 --> 1:36:17.720]  anything I did right they know they're there deceiving that's their job they
[1:36:17.720 --> 1:36:24.640]  think it's funny what they're doing and it tears my guts out it it absolutely
[1:36:24.640 --> 1:36:32.000]  tears my heart out to see that this is where we've gotten and this is where
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:36.960]  this country is and I'm just here promoting Americana hoping Trump's
[1:36:36.960 --> 1:36:43.120]  right Trump is doing bad saying they're gonna go after signs that's crazy well
[1:36:43.120 --> 1:36:47.480]  that's who got him elected more than anybody and I lit I list the things
[1:36:47.480 --> 1:36:50.520]  Trump does that are bad but I'm not sitting here then saying it's Hillary
[1:36:50.520 --> 1:36:56.680]  Clinton because it's so much better but I'm not here to even defend Trump I'm
[1:36:56.680 --> 1:37:01.960]  not even here to do that I'm just here promoting Americana and free market and
[1:37:01.960 --> 1:37:05.720]  what made this country great against the authoritarian unelected system of
[1:37:05.720 --> 1:37:10.720]  globalism that's all I stand for and that's why I'm under attack because I'm
[1:37:10.720 --> 1:37:14.720]  promoting things that are common sense and that are good and I'm pointing out
[1:37:14.720 --> 1:37:19.120]  how ridiculous it is when they still put Ryan Williams on TV who's a known liar
[1:37:19.120 --> 1:37:23.600]  to criticize yours truly and explain how I'm fake news and then have them without
[1:37:23.600 --> 1:37:28.040]  a video clip of me or anything say Joan says he's an actor and fake when I get
[1:37:28.040 --> 1:37:32.000]  asked in court when you wear a lizard mask you really believe I go that's a
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:38.920]  joke oh sir everything you do is it fake no and people go oh boy Alex is fake
[1:37:38.920 --> 1:37:48.720]  what that's a joke ladies and gentlemen that's a mind game it's crazy and you
[1:37:48.720 --> 1:37:51.520]  know what I'm gonna keep doing satire because adults and people that have
[1:37:51.520 --> 1:37:54.240]  brains get it that when I do rare satire it's a joke
[1:37:54.240 --> 1:37:59.680]  Lee and McAdoo never beat me up because I wasn't a Trump supporter it was a joke I
[1:37:59.680 --> 1:38:03.560]  wasn't really the Joker when I played the Joker once I was playing a character
[1:38:03.560 --> 1:38:08.640]  promoting fluoride that's what the Joker does in the comics is poison people
[1:38:08.640 --> 1:38:15.720]  through the water I say drink your fluoride kids you'll see pretty colors
[1:38:15.720 --> 1:38:20.920]  they go are you crazy do you really believe this and I go it's a joke do you
[1:38:20.920 --> 1:38:26.000]  really believe Obama's literally the devil it's satire oh you're fake about
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:34.160]  everything no his policies are devil like he probably is demon possessed but
[1:38:34.160 --> 1:38:40.400]  the audience has to be smarter when they sit there and they say Alex Joan says
[1:38:40.400 --> 1:38:47.200]  that Michelle Obama is a transvestite it was I was reporting what Joan Rivers
[1:38:47.200 --> 1:38:55.600]  said you know I said I was a trans zoological trans what do you call when
[1:38:55.600 --> 1:38:59.680]  you're an animal trans species I did a joke like three years ago putting two
[1:38:59.680 --> 1:39:06.640]  brown socks on my ears and said I was a hound dog I was sitting there at the
[1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:11.600]  kitchen table in the morning after I'd worked out with my kids eating breakfast
[1:39:11.600 --> 1:39:17.320]  and I did it as a joke and put them on my ears and they said that's funny so I
[1:39:17.320 --> 1:39:22.440]  said here's the camera video take me being a dog am I literally a dog am I
[1:39:22.440 --> 1:39:26.880]  insane no it's a joke does it mean I'm fake all the time because I did a joke
[1:39:26.880 --> 1:39:35.400]  as a dog no do I have to explain this and then I realized a lot of the public's
[1:39:35.400 --> 1:39:40.800]  gone they have no brains they literally don't know what planet they're on

[1:47:26.760 --> 1:47:32.280]  it's alex jones
[1:47:32.280 --> 1:47:36.040]  the reason i got frustrated with that caller 15 minutes ago is
[1:47:36.040 --> 1:47:40.600]  we were in totally desperate straits hillary was going to get four to five
[1:47:40.600 --> 1:47:44.120]  supreme court justices and they were going to move against the
[1:47:44.120 --> 1:47:47.320]  free press and shut everything down open the borders completely
[1:47:47.320 --> 1:47:50.680]  and bring us into full-scale globalism
[1:47:50.680 --> 1:47:54.360]  i expected trump to have to go sideways because washington is so controlled
[1:47:54.360 --> 1:47:57.320]  you got to make deals to even get stuff done
[1:47:57.320 --> 1:48:02.200]  and the first 70 days he was so perfect and so good
[1:48:02.200 --> 1:48:05.880]  that i could not believe it i said hundreds of times if he just got
[1:48:05.880 --> 1:48:10.040]  30 40 done in his first term that he would be as great as
[1:48:10.040 --> 1:48:14.200]  george washington he has gotten 30 of what his
[1:48:14.200 --> 1:48:17.960]  agenda is through in the first hundred days and he's
[1:48:17.960 --> 1:48:22.360]  done pretty much perfectly on 80 of his promises that he has implemented
[1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:26.520]  he's gone bad sideways on assange and whistleblowers
[1:48:26.520 --> 1:48:30.120]  bad sideways on a bunch of other issues but he just had the nsa
[1:48:30.120 --> 1:48:33.960]  and email gathering of american citizens that came out in the washington
[1:48:33.960 --> 1:48:37.240]  post today so so much good is happening with
[1:48:37.240 --> 1:48:41.240]  trump it makes my head spin but he does that stuff
[1:48:41.240 --> 1:48:44.920]  with the false flag whether he was behind it or the globalists were behind
[1:48:44.920 --> 1:48:47.800]  it clearly it's the rebels clearly it wasn't Assad
[1:48:47.800 --> 1:48:52.360]  that's not right but he's facing north korea he's facing china
[1:48:52.360 --> 1:48:55.880]  he's got to look strong for them and i'm not supporting macky of ellie and
[1:48:55.880 --> 1:48:59.880]  garbage but i get what trump's doing so they don't say he's a russian spy
[1:48:59.880 --> 1:49:03.960]  he's gotten tough on syria and russia
[1:49:04.520 --> 1:49:09.480]  so i'm not defending some of the bad things trumps doing but i'm telling you
[1:49:09.480 --> 1:49:12.840]  we ought to be on our knees thanking god we don't have hillary
[1:49:12.840 --> 1:49:16.680]  because this isn't lesser or two evils hillary was a whole another world than
[1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:20.360]  trump ladies and gentlemen and wanted a lot bigger wars
[1:49:20.360 --> 1:49:24.040]  and sometimes you got to have some smaller events to stave off bigger
[1:49:24.040 --> 1:49:27.880]  events and trump was had enough ambiguity
[1:49:27.880 --> 1:49:31.400]  that they didn't get rid of their chemicals like they promised so he could
[1:49:31.400 --> 1:49:34.920]  blow up where they were at under the deal they made with the pentagon four
[1:49:34.920 --> 1:49:39.880]  years ago when the pentagon told obama to go fly a kite
[1:49:39.880 --> 1:49:43.320]  so and i told you trump said that in two days later he came out and said exactly
[1:49:43.320 --> 1:49:46.440]  that they didn't give up their chemicals so regardless of who did it
[1:49:46.440 --> 1:49:50.040]  he had a right to blow up that base and nobody died
[1:49:50.040 --> 1:49:54.840]  i'm not defending it but you know what it sure shut down the globalist didn't
[1:49:54.840 --> 1:49:57.400]  got his approval rating up and i'm not defending it
[1:49:57.400 --> 1:50:01.640]  i don't like us using their tricks but from a macky of ellie and view from
[1:50:01.640 --> 1:50:04.920]  our perspective it's working
[1:50:05.800 --> 1:50:10.120]  trumps a different type of animal and he's not here to screw us folks
[1:50:10.120 --> 1:50:14.440]  he wants america powerful and strong to take over globalism
[1:50:14.440 --> 1:50:18.680]  and if we take it over to promote free market and to shut down radical islam
[1:50:18.680 --> 1:50:22.600]  and to actually empower these countries that's better than the globalist model of
[1:50:22.600 --> 1:50:25.960]  globalism to make everybody poor and under their control and i'm not
[1:50:25.960 --> 1:50:29.000]  defending it i told you at the inauguration he was going to take over
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:32.520]  globalism i could see it all i can see what he's
[1:50:32.520 --> 1:50:36.280]  doing without him ever saying it
[1:50:36.360 --> 1:50:40.120]  and he's either the greatest thing this country ever seen or if he starts going
[1:50:40.120 --> 1:50:43.160]  sideways and doing really bad stuff a few years from now
[1:50:43.160 --> 1:50:48.520]  then he may be the devil he's because my spider sense says he's good
[1:50:48.520 --> 1:50:52.360]  and i and i knew his plan day one i could instinctively see it and now you see
[1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:56.120]  it unfolding i'm synced that mean i totally agree
[1:50:56.120 --> 1:50:59.240]  but i know what trumps can do before he does it
[1:50:59.240 --> 1:51:01.880]  because i can understand the moves and what he's doing i'm looking at the same
[1:51:01.880 --> 1:51:05.000]  chessboard but
[1:51:05.720 --> 1:51:09.160]  he could be so evil that somehow spiritually he's cloaked
[1:51:09.160 --> 1:51:13.400]  he's a sith analogy and i can't see it but i don't think that's what it is i
[1:51:13.400 --> 1:51:16.840]  think it's more sophisticated than that i think trumps being used by god to
[1:51:16.840 --> 1:51:20.200]  really unmask these people but he's using some of their own tricks at a level
[1:51:20.200 --> 1:51:24.440]  to absolutely scramble their system but if you talk about defeating globalism
[1:51:24.440 --> 1:51:31.000]  discrediting it bringing jobs home you couldn't ask for better
[1:51:31.720 --> 1:51:35.400]  andrew in boston wants to talk about the armenian genocide
[1:51:35.400 --> 1:51:38.840]  i talked about that earlier in christian mail who says trumps a dictator
[1:51:38.840 --> 1:51:42.600]  when he's not criticizes him for blocking unvetted muslims coming in
[1:51:42.600 --> 1:51:48.360]  when he's in a movie about the historic muslims in 1914 50 60 17 18
[1:51:48.360 --> 1:51:51.240]  murdering over a million and a half peaceful armenians
[1:51:51.240 --> 1:51:54.840]  christians who'd been there before the muslims took over turkey
[1:51:54.840 --> 1:52:00.200]  so bail you can't have it both ways bro we're fighting the modern caliphate here
[1:52:00.200 --> 1:52:04.920]  they're the ones that aren't tolerant not us bail go ahead andrew
[1:52:04.920 --> 1:52:08.200]  thank you very much for taking michael alex thank you brother
[1:52:08.200 --> 1:52:12.040]  um i just want to touch upon um because you talk about the armenian genocide
[1:52:12.040 --> 1:52:15.320]  and it's so important that you bring it up you really your credibility goes up
[1:52:15.320 --> 1:52:18.600]  when talking about this so just a bit of history for the viewers
[1:52:18.600 --> 1:52:23.640]  they murdered and they rounded up 250 intellectuals armenians doctors and
[1:52:23.640 --> 1:52:26.040]  lawyers and so that i see they're doing the same
[1:52:26.040 --> 1:52:29.560]  thing with you and cernovich they're trying to assassinate your character
[1:52:29.560 --> 1:52:32.760]  they're trying to get rid of you because you are the spiritual and intellectual
[1:52:32.760 --> 1:52:35.400]  leaders of the freedom movement so i think it's very important that you
[1:52:35.400 --> 1:52:39.400]  touch upon this and i really recommend all the readers and the listeners to go
[1:52:39.400 --> 1:52:43.160]  just go to youtube look up armenian genocide and educate yourselves and
[1:52:43.160 --> 1:52:46.680]  one more thing i want to put up alex they always put up all this american
[1:52:46.680 --> 1:52:50.200]  guilt of not accepting immigrants america the united states
[1:52:50.200 --> 1:52:53.560]  was the first nation that accepted the christian armenian
[1:52:53.560 --> 1:52:57.480]  immigrants and they called they said they shall not perish they had a campaign
[1:52:57.480 --> 1:53:00.440]  and they brought in these christian armenians and what did the armenian
[1:53:00.440 --> 1:53:05.000]  immigrants do they simulated they created the mri machine in world war one
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:09.160]  the father of modern plastic surgery was an armenian so america took them in and
[1:53:09.160 --> 1:53:12.280]  look what happened in a few small years of liberty and freedom that the
[1:53:12.280 --> 1:53:16.120]  americans gave we contributed back to society so i think that's very important
[1:53:16.120 --> 1:53:18.280]  that's right statistically armenians i've read it
[1:53:18.280 --> 1:53:21.800]  are one of the most wealthy successful groups through innovation and
[1:53:21.800 --> 1:53:24.920]  development of very ancient culture and i want to do a whole special not just
[1:53:24.920 --> 1:53:28.120]  only armenians but other christians over the thousand years of islamic
[1:53:28.120 --> 1:53:31.720]  control that they wiped out in turkey that was the you know
[1:53:31.720 --> 1:53:35.240]  eastern holy roman empire people don't know this is the heart
[1:53:35.240 --> 1:53:41.000]  of christianity uh and how armenia invented christendom people don't
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:44.600]  understand this and america brought them here
[1:53:44.600 --> 1:53:48.040]  we'll bring people here that want to have a free country but sorry
[1:53:48.040 --> 1:53:51.960]  the muslims always act like they're nice till their numbers get high enough and
[1:53:51.960 --> 1:53:55.800]  then they start killing it's a fact does it mean there aren't some nice muslim
[1:53:55.800 --> 1:53:59.640]  sure but they're not the ones that are in control that's not my opinion
[1:53:59.640 --> 1:54:04.360]  that's a fact andrew absolutely and so i just want to touch upon
[1:54:04.360 --> 1:54:08.360]  i am a doctor i'm doing a research at a harvard teaching hospital here
[1:54:08.360 --> 1:54:11.560]  and i just see the attacks happening so the info wars website
[1:54:11.560 --> 1:54:15.000]  which i used to be able to visit has now been blocked it's called a forbidden
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:18.680]  website so you can go and see an endocom you can go on salon dot com but
[1:54:18.680 --> 1:54:22.200]  info wars dot com is blocked so i can tell you also
[1:54:22.200 --> 1:54:25.240]  that liver shield some of these products that i've actually tried i've
[1:54:25.240 --> 1:54:29.640]  experimented with they had a help absolutely so i honestly think it's
[1:54:29.640 --> 1:54:33.240]  very important to support your broadcast but actually these stuff works
[1:54:33.240 --> 1:54:36.280]  one more thing alex before i you know i have you while i have you
[1:54:36.280 --> 1:54:39.960]  i really if i can give you some advice because i really enjoy watching when
[1:54:39.960 --> 1:54:43.880]  you did the video on the taiwan call with china and you talk about the history
[1:54:43.880 --> 1:54:47.640]  and geopolitics and shanghai shek and the communists if you could do some
[1:54:47.640 --> 1:54:51.160]  more videos about that because you have a lot of new listeners and we really
[1:54:51.160 --> 1:54:54.200]  we really suck up this information because we're so hungry for it and we
[1:54:54.200 --> 1:54:56.280]  don't see it in the mainstream media so
[1:54:56.280 --> 1:54:59.720]  if that's some advice i can give you and some advice to president trump
[1:54:59.720 --> 1:55:03.000]  i think he really needs to watch his sticks with jared kushina
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:06.360]  gary kohn i think these people they call him so-called centrist
[1:55:06.360 --> 1:55:09.480]  i think that they're just the opposite side of the same dirty coin sure there's
[1:55:09.480 --> 1:55:13.800]  a big column do you personally have an armenian background
[1:55:13.800 --> 1:55:18.280]  i do i um so i was raised uh in australia but my parents came from the
[1:55:18.280 --> 1:55:22.040]  survey union and so we know what communism so when they they would actually
[1:55:22.040 --> 1:55:25.480]  take you um they would take you they would interrogate you and say you're the spy
[1:55:25.480 --> 1:55:28.280]  of the survey union and they'll take you to the gulag
[1:55:28.280 --> 1:55:31.320]  and are you sorry well that's it for those that don't know with with armenians
[1:55:31.320 --> 1:55:34.360]  or in russia or anywhere first they don't let you publish
[1:55:34.360 --> 1:55:37.560]  then they put you in ghettos then they arrest your leaders then they arrest your
[1:55:37.560 --> 1:55:41.000]  young men then your old men then they rape and kill your daughters and your
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:45.240]  wives this is the same paradigm and the globalists are openly coming
[1:55:45.240 --> 1:55:49.160]  and i'm not scared i believe america's going to rally we're going to defend but
[1:55:49.160 --> 1:55:52.600]  people need to know i can't talk about a lot of stuff behind the scenes
[1:55:52.600 --> 1:55:56.520]  but everybody just saw what the media did coming in openly trying to influence
[1:55:56.520 --> 1:56:00.200]  things openly reveling and trying to take my children away
[1:56:00.200 --> 1:56:03.640]  and it's much worse than that behind the scenes i'm not at liberty yet to talk
[1:56:03.640 --> 1:56:05.880]  about it but we've discovered what they're doing
[1:56:05.880 --> 1:56:09.000]  we didn't just get the google documents we've gotten some other bombshell stuff
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:13.160]  that's so damning that i've got top people involved in what we're going to
[1:56:13.160 --> 1:56:15.800]  do but folks need to understand it's a miracle
[1:56:15.800 --> 1:56:20.600]  trump's gotten done when he's done uh overall he he's gotten so much done
[1:56:20.600 --> 1:56:24.120]  there's no way he's not for real or the enemy wouldn't be trying to bring him
[1:56:24.120 --> 1:56:27.960]  down what do you think i absolutely agree with you
[1:56:27.960 --> 1:56:31.640]  there's nothing else to say to that but one more thing alex just i'm really
[1:56:31.640 --> 1:56:35.160]  enjoying this conversation something that is very important that we all have to
[1:56:35.160 --> 1:56:38.600]  understand is when you give up your enemy always
[1:56:38.600 --> 1:56:42.520]  takes that as a sign that of weakness and attacks you anytime the armenian
[1:56:42.520 --> 1:56:45.880]  sport back the jews fall back during the holocaust the americans fall back in
[1:56:45.880 --> 1:56:49.480]  1776 every time you fight back you win
[1:56:49.480 --> 1:56:53.320]  every time you submit you lose that's just a general fact of humanity
[1:56:53.320 --> 1:56:56.600]  so i think we all have to support you i totally agree let me ask you this in
[1:56:56.600 --> 1:56:58.760]  closing and i'm sorry that our collars are out of town we're back tomorrow
[1:56:58.760 --> 1:57:01.640]  11 a.m to 3 p.m let me ask you this what do you make a christian bail beam in
[1:57:01.640 --> 1:57:03.800]  this great movie and then he's complaining about
[1:57:03.800 --> 1:57:07.960]  trump blocking muslims from seven unvetted countries
[1:57:07.960 --> 1:57:11.240]  so i think it's one of those things where a lot of these liberals their
[1:57:11.240 --> 1:57:14.360]  intentions they're well intentioned but they live in such a bubble and they
[1:57:14.360 --> 1:57:17.640]  consume the same kind of information that's forced there through them
[1:57:17.640 --> 1:57:21.320]  very intelligently and very subtly so i think he's just a victim of this kind of
[1:57:21.320 --> 1:57:24.840]  media manipulation where you had edward bernay's kind of with the public
[1:57:24.840 --> 1:57:28.760]  relations telling us you know this is how we have to trick the people and all
[1:57:28.760 --> 1:57:31.800]  that's right that's right we're out of time the armenians folks are one of the
[1:57:31.800 --> 1:57:35.000]  small remnants of most ancient christians that the
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:38.360]  globalists tried to wipe out and they want to wipe us all out no matter what
[1:57:38.360 --> 1:57:41.720]  color we are we're together in our love of christ i want to thank the crew and
[1:57:41.720 --> 1:57:45.320]  everybody else back tomorrow 11 a.m central if i'm still here we love you
[1:57:45.320 --> 1:58:09.400]  all thank you
