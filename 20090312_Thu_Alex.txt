[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:36.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.760 --> 00:42.000]  boy I tell you no rest for the wicked even though I'm trying to be good and
[00:42.000 --> 00:46.320]  a lot of radio and TV interviews right now in association with all of our work
[00:46.320 --> 00:51.920]  and doing this radio show four hours a day and I sat in for a couple hours with
[00:51.920 --> 00:57.720]  Jason Bermas last night and oversaw the launch of the Obama deception it is live
[00:57.720 --> 01:02.880]  ladies and gentlemen it is out it is available right now at prisonplanet.tv
[01:02.880 --> 01:10.200]  and of course you can get the DVD at info wars.com and those will start
[01:10.200 --> 01:17.800]  shipping out on Monday I pull the trigger a bit early with the release of the
[01:17.800 --> 01:23.400]  film because we had a lot of chicanery going on here with our good friends the
[01:23.400 --> 01:29.800]  New World Order and so I pulled the trigger last night at 7 p.m. central
[01:29.800 --> 01:38.160]  standard time and we've had about twice the number of downloads of the Obama
[01:38.160 --> 01:45.360]  deception from the prisonplanet.tv CDN super servers and we have members of it
[01:45.360 --> 01:49.560]  so folks are definitely sharing their passcode which is fine but you know if
[01:49.560 --> 01:54.080]  you give it to too many people it will time out and then you won't be able to
[01:54.080 --> 02:00.000]  get on at least while everybody else is on there under your membership you know
[02:00.000 --> 02:03.080]  as long as I can pay for the bandwidth I'd give it all out for free in the
[02:03.080 --> 02:08.640]  highest quality to the whole world because that's what I'm into I'm not into
[02:08.640 --> 02:13.720]  broads I'm not into I guess I am into broads my wife and I guess I can't say
[02:13.720 --> 02:18.640]  I'm not in the fast cars I got a fast car the point is that's not what I worship
[02:18.640 --> 02:23.280]  I'm not into big houses I'm not into trinkets I'm not into being worshiped I'm
[02:23.280 --> 02:28.240]  not into people thinking I'm great I'm into defeating criminals defeating the
[02:28.240 --> 02:41.440]  New World Order but so much is happening so much is going on right now just makes
[02:41.440 --> 02:48.080]  my head spin very important broadcast lined up for you today we had her on for
[02:48.080 --> 02:53.320]  about 30 minutes last week Dr. Rebecca Carly will join us for about an hour and
[02:53.320 --> 02:57.760]  a half today to really detail what's actually happening with the flu vaccines
[02:57.760 --> 03:03.240]  and Baxter pharmaceutical and Bayer pharmaceutical and the rest of them that's
[03:03.240 --> 03:07.960]  coming up at 1 30 today so two and a half hours from now she'll be with us
[03:07.960 --> 03:11.520]  for an hour and a half and we'll open the phones up on that subject because it
[03:11.520 --> 03:19.120]  can't be ignored that live and this is Baxter's quoted in major newspapers
[03:19.840 --> 03:24.800]  people email me saying how do you know it was live I mean I was reading the
[03:24.800 --> 03:33.480]  Toronto Sun the Canadian press Bloomberg yeah we since found a Bloomberg
[03:33.480 --> 03:38.280]  article about it that we'd missed for about a week so it was out but you would
[03:38.280 --> 03:44.200]  think that you're mixing it in with the vaccine product for the regular flu
[03:44.200 --> 03:48.800]  vaccines where it could have mutated I mean if you got injected with a good
[03:48.800 --> 03:52.640]  chance it would kill you but but the point is is that it could have mutated
[03:52.640 --> 03:58.480]  with the other flu virus and just been incredibly devastating so we're gonna
[03:58.480 --> 04:02.840]  continue to focus on that today but in the meantime the Obama deception has
[04:02.840 --> 04:08.920]  dropped and I want to open the phones up I have never seen such rave reviews for
[04:08.920 --> 04:16.240]  any film I've made it is as people are saying not as in your face very smooth
[04:16.240 --> 04:24.000]  very concise we rushed to make it but it ended up turning out better because we
[04:24.000 --> 04:28.960]  made it in three months instead of six to eight months so it's a very fulfilling
[04:28.960 --> 04:34.240]  good feeling I felt really good last night when I went home at 1130 knowing
[04:34.240 --> 04:37.720]  that we'd gotten this workout and hadn't been stopped from getting it out of the

[06:07.880 --> 06:12.140]  stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like
[06:12.140 --> 06:17.360]  to see the Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working
[06:17.360 --> 06:21.320]  for the best interest of the American people while Obama's already fudging
[06:21.320 --> 06:26.000]  yeah but since day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical
[06:26.000 --> 06:30.600]  mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group
[06:30.600 --> 06:37.640]  of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism it's not about
[06:37.640 --> 06:42.120]  left to right it's about a one-world government this film documents who

[07:15.520 --> 07:20.600]  trillions in savings net worth and retirement accounts have been lost by

[08:05.720 --> 08:22.680]  radio network you know we have a major blind spot here at this office and we're
[08:22.680 --> 08:26.320]  always trying to recognize our blind spots recognize our weaknesses so that
[08:26.320 --> 08:34.400]  we can get better and we've certainly evolved over the last coming up on 14
[08:34.400 --> 08:37.720]  years and gotten a lot better but I intend Lord willing I'm still alive in
[08:37.720 --> 08:44.640]  14 years to just continue to improve in the work we do the quality everything
[08:44.640 --> 08:50.480]  that we cover here now the story I'm about to cover in the past maybe once a
[08:50.480 --> 08:53.920]  year I'd come on there and say this story is of such import I must give it
[08:53.920 --> 08:58.120]  proper respect I must build it up I can't just start reporting on this like
[08:58.120 --> 09:05.040]  it's no big deal because that is my blind spot that is your blind spot every
[09:05.040 --> 09:08.240]  day I see articles about how they're trying to make people take microchips
[09:08.240 --> 09:15.960]  elderly children people in old folks homes criminals and people convicts and
[09:20.400 --> 09:25.520]  I don't even cover it anymore it's just yeah the government wants to chip us we
[09:25.520 --> 09:29.600]  have the army documents we have the Pentagon documents we have the American
[09:29.600 --> 09:33.800]  Federation of Scientists admitting that's the plan and it's you know went
[09:33.800 --> 09:37.320]  from ten years ago being a lunatic kook if you read army documents on air
[09:37.320 --> 09:40.120]  people wouldn't believe you really had them you know you gave them where they
[09:40.120 --> 09:44.480]  could get them from the government they just said oh it's not true crazy oh yeah
[09:44.480 --> 09:48.200]  everybody knows we need to take chips and Hollywood people get fake teeth for
[09:48.200 --> 09:52.440]  their kids with transmitters on them and yeah everybody knows Google can watch
[09:52.440 --> 09:58.680]  you over the onboard microphone and camera on all the new computers and
[09:58.680 --> 10:01.240]  yeah it's admitted they're listening to your cell phone in real time and yeah
[10:01.240 --> 10:05.880]  the NAs NSA is watching you and yeah there's death squads and yeah they're
[10:05.880 --> 10:10.240]  building FEMA camps kind of like you know all right they're putting military
[10:10.240 --> 10:14.760]  now in every major police department regular army and regular Marines as
[10:14.760 --> 10:20.360]  liaisons in the departments and yeah well there's a shooting or a car wreck the
[10:20.360 --> 10:24.920]  army shows up or the Marines show up now and they got side arms and but you know
[10:24.920 --> 10:32.480]  it's no big deal so when I say it's my blind spot I have just noticed
[10:32.480 --> 10:38.080]  psychologically that even though we're covering all of this if we don't take
[10:38.080 --> 10:42.200]  action against it see if we just approach this and emotionally fight the
[10:42.200 --> 10:49.080]  new world order then as we get acclimated to it we will stop fighting it
[10:49.080 --> 10:52.920]  it's like oh I used to be against the surveillance society but now I think I'm
[10:52.920 --> 10:59.160]  for it I was listening to Road Dog radio I like that trucker radio and I was
[10:59.160 --> 11:04.320]  listening to it on XM and the lady was like oh this poor guy parked his truck
[11:04.320 --> 11:08.400]  you know in an abandoned warehouse area because the food line wouldn't let him
[11:08.400 --> 11:11.640]  park it in the back you know they come in with loads and they won't let them dump
[11:11.640 --> 11:15.040]  them off when they're supposed to they make them wait and they go ah you can't
[11:15.040 --> 11:18.840]  stay here behind the fence go you know go somewhere else and the guy gets killed
[11:18.840 --> 11:23.160]  by some thug and the lady's on there going we just need cameras everywhere in
[11:23.160 --> 11:28.000]  the areas for cameras for the trucks no we need to leave the truck drivers alone
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.160]  and if you want to be a truck driver you're you're trusted with this giant
[11:32.160 --> 11:36.800]  18-wheeler that's a very skilled very professional profession on average that
[11:36.800 --> 11:41.400]  the establishment loves to demonize and make fun of then you need to carry a
[11:41.400 --> 11:46.800]  fired arm see I believe what Kennesaw Georgia did when their crime rate
[11:46.800 --> 11:52.880]  exploded back in the 80s they said you have to own a gun now there was a quote
[11:52.880 --> 11:59.120]  waiver but the crime rate went down by over 95% in just two years because the
[11:59.120 --> 12:02.640]  word got out in that suburb of Atlanta don't come around trying to rob people
[12:02.640 --> 12:07.400]  here and you know I think that people should be armed truck drivers should be
[12:07.400 --> 12:12.960]  armed oh no we'll have Wild West shootouts oh yeah 40 states have passed
[12:12.960 --> 12:17.560]  right to carry concealed carry on average their crime rates have dropped by
[12:17.560 --> 12:22.040]  about 25% some states it's 30 something some they say it's 15 or 14 you know
[12:22.040 --> 12:27.160]  Florida 25 Texas 27 I saw the numbers because let me tell you something
[12:27.160 --> 12:31.560]  criminals are scared you come in my studio trying to hurt anybody around
[12:31.560 --> 12:37.640]  here you die unless you get the drop on me you come to my house trying to go for
[12:37.640 --> 12:42.880]  my family you die I'm not there my wife's there you come in you die we're just
[12:42.880 --> 12:49.840]  gonna calmly point your center of mass and open fire because they're all these
[12:49.840 --> 12:54.360]  scum running around robbing and stealing and killing we need more guns you
[12:54.360 --> 12:56.920]  know all there's all these home invasions I just saw the numbers from
[12:56.920 --> 13:01.280]  CNN yesterday I'm gonna get to a certain stack where it's just massive home
[13:01.280 --> 13:05.400]  invasions increases women being raped and killed and in these 911 calls where
[13:05.400 --> 13:08.760]  it takes the cops 10 minutes to get there than they blame the police the
[13:08.760 --> 13:13.200]  police can't protect you it's not their responsibility to protect you they can't
[13:13.200 --> 13:18.280]  be everywhere they can't I mean unless we lived in total Nazi Germany and then
[13:18.280 --> 13:22.680]  that's a greater evil you can have a cop on every street corner you can't stop
[13:22.680 --> 13:25.560]  it they can't always be there because they'll be over there at a car wreck
[13:25.560 --> 13:31.000]  right when the robbery is happening and these these parents send their daughters
[13:31.000 --> 13:38.360]  off and get them apartments and foreign cities you know in other states and they
[13:38.360 --> 13:43.400]  don't get them firearms training they don't give them a firearm they don't
[13:43.400 --> 13:47.200]  even you know they give them maybe some little keychain you'll always see scared
[13:47.200 --> 13:50.360]  women in a parking lot you know I'll go to the grocery store I'll get home at
[13:50.360 --> 13:54.840]  10 30 at night my wife my wife goes out we need orange juice and pancake mix and
[13:54.840 --> 13:58.760]  strawberries and blah blah blah we go to the store and I go sure and I go to the
[13:58.760 --> 14:05.640]  you know HEB or whatever at midnight and I'll be pushing my little card out
[14:05.640 --> 14:08.640]  there's always women and they and they get scared and they you know they jingle
[14:08.640 --> 14:13.160]  their keys they'll usually have like some little some little you know pointed
[14:13.160 --> 14:17.800]  thing on their keys and they you know because it's it's they'll be like 15
[14:17.800 --> 14:21.400]  cars in the parking lot and of course your your cars parked right by every
[14:21.400 --> 14:26.400]  time where the other lone woman's coming out it's always never on the other
[14:26.400 --> 14:29.560]  side sometimes I'll just go to a coat machine to get a water and I see a woman
[14:29.560 --> 14:33.600]  walking out all just because they're so paranoid so scared so out of their mind
[14:33.600 --> 14:38.320]  with fear that you know if you imagine how they're much they're scared of people
[14:38.320 --> 14:43.880]  might have tattoos or might be black I mean I looked like you know a younger
[14:43.880 --> 14:47.400]  Archie Bunker or something you know clean-cut everything a little overweight
[14:47.400 --> 14:52.960]  you know your your you know your average white schmo and these women will be
[14:52.960 --> 14:56.840]  shaking and they'll get in their car real fast and slam the door and you're
[14:56.840 --> 15:01.080]  there unloading the vegetables in the back of your car looking at her okay
[15:01.080 --> 15:08.880]  lady believe me it's weird though the women that aren't that attractive they
[15:08.880 --> 15:14.200]  act even more paranoid and then you'll have some foxy chicken the parking lot
[15:14.200 --> 15:17.680]  and she's kind of smiling at you and everything it's weird but you know the
[15:17.680 --> 15:28.840]  issue here is that women are just gripped with fear they are gripped with
[15:28.840 --> 15:35.480]  just out of control fear and I can't imagine having two daughters what it
[15:35.480 --> 15:40.040]  would be like to raise them to be cowardly to raise them to be weak to
[15:40.040 --> 15:44.880]  raise them to be victims not my girls they're gonna be locked and loaded
[15:44.880 --> 15:48.280]  anybody busting their house anybody gives them a problem they're gonna kill
[15:48.280 --> 15:58.840]  you that's how it works my women aren't domesticated cowardly weak people
[15:58.840 --> 16:05.400]  period and you know what I said that possessively you're right I'm a I'm a
[16:05.400 --> 16:10.680]  male chauvinist pig I'm possessive of my women and they like the fact they're my
[16:10.680 --> 16:15.680]  women my grandma likes the fact she's my woman my mother likes the fact that
[16:15.680 --> 16:25.280]  she's my woman my dad's my dad I'm possessive I don't know how they take
[16:25.280 --> 16:31.520]  your survival instinct out of you and how they teach you feminism is being
[16:31.520 --> 16:36.680]  cowardly and scared and shaking with five locks on your door unenpowered don't
[16:36.680 --> 16:44.280]  tell what real feminism is it's a woman with a submachine gun it's a woman that
[16:44.280 --> 16:52.880]  if you go after her she's gonna karate chop you in the neck if you tackle her
[16:52.880 --> 16:57.480]  she's gonna bite you she's gonna scratch your eyes out if she didn't get the
[16:57.480 --> 17:02.400]  draw get the gun in your face I mean this is sick they've turned the men into
[17:02.400 --> 17:08.400]  gilded chicken neck cowardly people and they turn the women into chicken neck
[17:08.400 --> 17:18.040]  cowards and we're not supposed to be like that that's not who we are now I've
[17:18.040 --> 17:24.280]  got huge news here and I am I'm already digressing just imagining the fact with
[17:24.280 --> 17:27.680]  these shootings and the rest of it you know this punk in Germany where they
[17:27.680 --> 17:32.360]  have a total gunman he gets a gun somehow brings it in it's turning out he
[17:32.360 --> 17:36.880]  was in psychiatric care guaranteed he was onward winner prozac or something
[17:36.880 --> 17:40.080]  it's gonna come out I'm scanning German news guaranteed now because they're
[17:40.080 --> 17:44.360]  admitting he'd been seeing a shrink guaranteed I knew it of course because

[18:22.640 --> 18:26.560]  with it or maybe he was aiming too high or whatever he went in and killed the

[24:13.120 --> 24:18.480]  okay I went off on a tirade about how we train our men and women in this
[24:18.480 --> 24:23.800]  country to just lay down and die and call the police when the average 911 call
[24:23.800 --> 24:28.040]  takes around 12 minutes in this country it changes every year but that's the
[24:28.040 --> 24:32.240]  normal average some years it's 10 minutes some years 14 minutes last time I saw it
[24:32.240 --> 24:36.600]  last year it was 12 and a half minutes you know in 12 and a half minutes
[24:36.600 --> 24:43.800]  somebody can kill you rape you hang you burn your house down and women you need
[24:43.800 --> 24:49.400]  to go to the local shooting range you need to you know ask the shooting range
[24:49.400 --> 24:55.560]  owner who's a good trainer I want to learn how to use a revolver it's simple
[24:55.560 --> 25:01.360]  when you're in a jam it works the best and pun intended doesn't jam generally
[25:01.360 --> 25:07.480]  and you just want to get something like a 22 revolver at first couple hundred
[25:07.480 --> 25:14.280]  bucks train on that and then you'll find that you see movies like police academy
[25:14.280 --> 25:18.240]  where they shoot the 357 Magnum and it blows the old lady back 50 feet it's
[25:18.240 --> 25:24.440]  all lies folks I mean I've shot 50 caliber handguns that just bear you know
[25:24.440 --> 25:32.360]  just a little bit of a jerk I've got a Taurus handgun called the judge that
[25:32.360 --> 25:42.080]  shoots 50 caliber rounds and shoots 410 shotgun shells but it's legal because
[25:42.080 --> 25:48.080]  it's a you know it's a it's a pistol but it will shoot 410 and that's a great
[25:48.080 --> 25:51.640]  home defense gun because it won't shoot through the walls until your family you
[25:51.640 --> 25:57.920]  got like a number five shot in there it'll devastate somebody and yes that's
[25:57.920 --> 26:02.120]  the type of firepower I have I mean I'm proud that I'm not a slave I'm proud
[26:02.120 --> 26:12.680]  that somebody comes in my house I've got a five-shot handgun with 410 ammo
[26:12.680 --> 26:19.160]  coming at you it's that simple because if I'm half asleep or something going on
[26:19.160 --> 26:22.600]  I don't want to go to the big gun safe I want to go to the instant access safes
[26:22.600 --> 26:32.320]  and I want to just grab out the revolvers and go at it now in the old
[26:32.320 --> 26:43.560]  days before I had children I would just have a semi-auto Mossberg 12 gauge with
[26:43.560 --> 26:51.560]  seven seven shotgun rounds in it all right I'm already now obsessing off into
[26:51.560 --> 26:56.200]  gun nomenclature I've got to stop I've got to stop I've got all this important
[26:56.200 --> 27:01.720]  news and I want to go to your calls as well here's the big news okay it broke
[27:01.720 --> 27:07.160]  yesterday at info wars dot com curtain of the great story on it I got this in
[27:07.160 --> 27:10.840]  the middle of the show yesterday and I'd already gotten another one of these from
[27:10.840 --> 27:16.520]  Missouri but I got one from late last year that was bad but wasn't as bad as
[27:16.520 --> 27:20.240]  this one and I get these all the time from police all over the country it's
[27:20.240 --> 27:23.880]  always the same letter had the same setup it'll just have the seal of the
[27:23.880 --> 27:27.840]  state that the feds issued it through this is through the threat integration
[27:27.840 --> 27:34.200]  fusion center of Missouri I separately was sent the latest version from
[27:34.200 --> 27:38.520]  California Highway Patrol and I'm thinking about he didn't say in this
[27:38.520 --> 27:44.720]  don't say his name he's a sergeant with a highway patrol in California but I'm
[27:44.720 --> 27:49.680]  not going to say his name and I want to talk to him and get him on the show
[27:49.680 --> 27:54.040]  doesn't sound like he's worried about his voice being recognized but I I don't
[27:54.040 --> 28:01.040]  want the sergeant to say his name but I've got his card right here and of
[28:01.040 --> 28:04.200]  course we looked him up and found him on the web as well then I have the Missouri
[28:04.200 --> 28:10.480]  State Police Officer who does not want his name used but that was an older
[28:10.480 --> 28:16.160]  version from I guess seven months ago this one was put out on the 20th of
[28:16.160 --> 28:28.040]  February 2009 so just about I don't know 20 days ago or so I guess 22 days ago if
[28:28.040 --> 28:36.040]  you want to be technical and you know it's ridiculous we post this nine page
[28:36.040 --> 28:46.920]  FBI FEMA ADL propaganda and it has the phone numbers of the Missouri State
[28:46.920 --> 28:52.600]  Police on it and we went online and confirmed this is their publication it
[28:52.600 --> 28:57.560]  says law enforcement sensitive though don't distribute and people start
[28:57.560 --> 29:01.360]  commenting on the info wars.com story oh I don't believe this I want this
[29:01.360 --> 29:05.680]  confirmed hey jackasses and I'm sorry to use that term but you really need to
[29:05.680 --> 29:10.200]  get your head out of the sand call the phone number we did they've refused to
[29:10.200 --> 29:15.160]  come on we have two senior state police officers names and they admit they
[29:15.160 --> 29:20.800]  issued this it's confirmed and we just wrote up the blurb their names what they
[29:20.800 --> 29:24.920]  told us it's being sent to Paul Watson who's doing a story on it so yes it's
[29:24.920 --> 29:30.480]  real it's true Ron Paul libertarians Bob Barr supporters constitutional party
[29:30.480 --> 29:35.800]  supporters you are terrorists that want to kill police is basically what this says

[33:51.480 --> 34:11.360]  it Chuck Barry this is really the real father of rock and roll
[34:11.360 --> 34:36.380]  oh yeah john e me good
[34:36.380 --> 34:50.780]  for folks. I have been sent hundreds of federal martial slat training. I've been sent videos.
[34:50.780 --> 34:56.140]  We've been sent internal training manuals. I know the Ritters here in town with their
[34:56.140 --> 35:01.700]  local TV show. Years ago they went to a Homeland Security meeting that was public here in
[35:01.700 --> 35:08.340]  town and they listed, you know, basically conservative groups, constitutionalists, threats, tying
[35:08.340 --> 35:12.380]  it in with al-Qaeda. It's all guilt by association. They'll go, there are groups that don't want
[35:12.380 --> 35:16.340]  a world banking system to rule them. And next we'll tell you about white supremacists
[35:16.340 --> 35:23.100]  that kill cops. And so it's just this base demonization and that's what this MIAC Strategic
[35:23.100 --> 35:26.780]  Report, the Modern Militia Movement, starts out with all these examples of cops being
[35:26.780 --> 35:32.480]  killed over the last, you know, 25 years by white supremacists that's still a handful
[35:32.480 --> 35:36.220]  of cases, but they just hype them and hype them and hype them to scare the cops. Then
[35:36.220 --> 35:40.820]  they move into Ron Paul. They move into how they need more gun control and to stamp all
[35:40.820 --> 35:45.900]  the bullets. They move into how now there is a new world order, but if you don't like
[35:45.900 --> 35:50.660]  it, you're a terrorist. And then they attack Ron Paul and everybody else in here, Bob Barr,
[35:50.660 --> 35:54.540]  you name it. Now, here's the issue. And I'm going to go over this in detail and take your
[35:54.540 --> 35:58.580]  phone calls and get into the Obama deception that's now out at PrisonPlanet.TV and a lot
[35:58.580 --> 36:02.700]  more. That's where you can watch it right now at PrisonPlanet.TV. Super high quality,
[36:02.700 --> 36:06.900]  the way it's meant to be seen. Just atrocious. I've seen some clips on the web. People grab
[36:06.900 --> 36:10.700]  from it and I just wish folks you wouldn't race to put something up and then not and
[36:10.700 --> 36:14.460]  then, you know, encoded on YouTube and the lowest bit quality. So you get it up first.
[36:14.460 --> 36:19.540]  It looks like hell. I mean, I really wanted to be seen, but all I saw was horrible copies
[36:19.540 --> 36:24.140]  of it out there. Please go to PrisonPlanet.TV folks and download the film in super high
[36:24.140 --> 36:28.020]  quality and burn it to disc and DVD like it's meant to be. Now I'm going to stop there.
[36:28.020 --> 36:37.220]  To make a long story short, we put this out with other FBI training manuals and FBI training
[36:37.220 --> 36:41.860]  flyers to police saying, look out for constitutionalists and those that make frequent references
[36:41.860 --> 36:46.860]  to the U.S. Constitution and gun owners. And then they say right next to that, you know,
[36:46.860 --> 36:53.020]  they want to kill cops. Look out just totally made up totally. And in this new document,
[36:53.020 --> 36:58.180]  it says there's also mainstream public groups that say they want state rights and that and
[36:58.180 --> 37:01.100]  that try to get involved in the community and say they want to work with police and
[37:01.100 --> 37:06.460]  sheriffs and say they want to work with the cities and, and, and they're secretly violent
[37:06.460 --> 37:13.260]  cell groups. Look, it was just anybody involved in anything. You're a terrorist. And so we
[37:13.260 --> 37:18.060]  post this with other previous training manuals and things that we've had up on the site.
[37:18.060 --> 37:22.700]  You know, the older stories going back many years and people start commenting and I saw
[37:22.700 --> 37:26.980]  people on the Daily Paul commenting going, I want proof. This comes from Alex Jones.
[37:26.980 --> 37:32.940]  I want proof. I want proof. Ron Paul is in here. I will read the thing. I want proof
[37:32.940 --> 37:38.260]  that you know, this is going on. You don't know about all this. You don't know about
[37:38.260 --> 37:43.100]  the talking points to demonize Ron Paul and Patriots. You don't know about police in what
[37:43.100 --> 37:46.900]  South Carolina busting down a door without a warrant because they had a Ron Paul sign
[37:46.900 --> 37:50.820]  in the yard that was all over the news. I mean, you don't know about all this. Are you hiding
[37:50.820 --> 37:55.380]  under a rock? You didn't know that you didn't take time to read it where there was the phone
[37:55.380 --> 38:05.260]  number to the state police. Okay. I have this separately from California Highway Patrol
[38:05.260 --> 38:10.580]  and I have it for Missouri. And frankly, I was so busy a few months ago when this came
[38:10.580 --> 38:14.940]  in for Missouri, the first time a different variant of it. They come out best I can tell
[38:14.940 --> 38:19.140]  every month and they basically told Rob do our producer that today he talked to the state
[38:19.140 --> 38:23.100]  police in Missouri. They admitted they put this out. This is theirs. We called the phone
[38:23.100 --> 38:31.100]  number on it. Okay. You can call them too. It's just the denial, the denial. They're
[38:31.100 --> 38:35.900]  openly announcing all over the news that military is being put in the police departments
[38:35.900 --> 38:41.220]  as liaison officers and the military is going to be out stopping drunks. See that and helping
[38:41.220 --> 38:45.620]  at car wrecks. It's now being announced everywhere just like we told you it would be. We know
[38:45.620 --> 38:50.020]  how they operate to make the military the cops, the citizens think it's okay. Well, it's just
[38:50.020 --> 38:55.060]  to stop drugs. The Marines are here. Well, there was a mass shooting. The army, regular
[38:55.060 --> 39:01.980]  army came after and then ran checkpoints. And still there's denial. People email me
[39:01.980 --> 39:05.980]  and say, I want your proof of FEMA camps. I don't know. Houston Chronicle, Associated
[39:05.980 --> 39:11.540]  Press, bills, legislation, documents, army dot mills, civilian inmate labor camp program.
[39:11.540 --> 39:17.700]  I mean, you know, I mean, you can lead a horse to water. It's like leading a horse to the
[39:17.700 --> 39:23.580]  Great Lakes, man. It's sitting there dying of thirst and there's an ocean of fresh water
[39:23.580 --> 39:29.020]  there and it won't drink it. And you're telling me that isn't a giant reservoir of water for
[39:29.020 --> 39:39.780]  you to drink. Okay, then fine. I can't help you. I mean, it's just ridiculous. I wasn't
[39:39.780 --> 39:42.620]  bashing the daily poll itself. It's a great side. I was just people's comments and people's
[39:42.620 --> 39:47.980]  comments on info wars and emails. I'm kidding. I mean, it's just blows my mind. So I'm gonna
[39:47.980 --> 39:53.980]  go through the strategic report. If we take some calls and get into some other issues,
[39:53.980 --> 40:02.620]  but I wanted to bring Rob do in here, one of our producers because by the time I covered
[40:02.620 --> 40:08.700]  this yesterday, by the time I was worried about the launch of the Obama deception last
[40:08.700 --> 40:18.500]  night, it was too late to, you know, basically go back on air and well, we thought we fully
[40:18.500 --> 40:23.660]  documented it putting out the flyer and the phone numbers and I've seen literally a hundred
[40:23.660 --> 40:28.460]  of these different that the police have sent me because they come out every month or so
[40:28.460 --> 40:34.700]  in all 50 states. But Rob do here he is and we can give you the phone number. He called
[40:34.700 --> 40:38.340]  the state police this morning and he talked to two of them and we've got their names for
[40:38.340 --> 40:42.500]  you and they admitted they put this out. So Rob do give folks a report place. All right.
[40:42.500 --> 40:48.380]  So on page seven right at the bottom says Missouri information analysis center gives
[40:48.380 --> 40:53.740]  you a phone number. So I went and gave him gave him a call and I got another phone number
[40:53.740 --> 40:59.940]  and that was to another department at the Missouri state highway patrol and I talked
[40:59.940 --> 41:05.220]  to a captain hole and he said, I asked him if he wanted to come on the radio and talk
[41:05.220 --> 41:11.380]  about first ask him about them. My strategic report. He said, oh, yeah, that's a, he called
[41:11.380 --> 41:17.100]  it a report that they put out periodically and it is to quote. It's part of the normal
[41:17.100 --> 41:22.420]  operation for officers to receive these periodic reports for safety purposes and attract trends
[41:22.420 --> 41:28.980]  or changes. That's exactly what he said because they're all little intelligence agents now
[41:28.980 --> 41:35.180]  secret police. Right. And so I said, oh, well, this is interesting. And I pretend that one
[41:35.180 --> 41:39.020]  time I wanted to get him on the show. And so I said, is this something that Texans need
[41:39.020 --> 41:42.260]  to be worried about? Would you like to come on and give him this information and explain
[41:42.260 --> 41:47.260]  it? And he seemed interested in doing it and he was going to call me back. And then I got
[41:47.260 --> 41:54.900]  a call from Lieutenant John Hoates, HOTZ. And he said, captain hole not be able to come
[41:54.900 --> 41:59.020]  on the program. And I said, well, would you be able to? And he said, no, I've got to run
[41:59.020 --> 42:03.140]  to a meeting. And I said, well, what about next week? Can we get one of you guys on to
[42:03.140 --> 42:07.460]  talk about this? Cause this is very interesting. And I think this is the kind of information
[42:07.460 --> 42:13.020]  that we need to talk about. And he, he said, well, I don't know, give us a call next week.
[42:13.020 --> 42:16.580]  So I doubt though, want to come on, um, you know, and it's amazing if you want to put
[42:16.580 --> 42:19.740]  something out like this, that's fine, but at least be willing to come on and talk about
[42:19.740 --> 42:23.540]  it. You know, if you're going to have these ideas and, and write stuff about this about
[42:23.540 --> 42:28.540]  people, you know, man up, you know, you're an officer of the law. Now specifically this
[42:28.540 --> 42:35.940]  is this Mayak and this page six, it mentioned from Paul, by the way, we're going to go over
[42:35.940 --> 42:44.060]  it. The Missouri information analysis center is at a division of the highway patrol intelligence
[42:44.060 --> 42:50.740]  unit. Uh, and they give intelligence briefings to the state police and, and, and also, uh,
[42:50.740 --> 42:55.300]  bring them up to speed on new changes and regulations, uh, to traffic and traffic stops
[42:55.300 --> 42:59.540]  and go to their website. Uh, you can just Google Missouri information analysis center.
[42:59.540 --> 43:02.780]  I printed off their front page. I don't have the exact address, but just Google Missouri
[43:02.780 --> 43:08.420]  information analysis center, Curt Nemo linked to it in the article he wrote last night.
[43:08.420 --> 43:13.740]  And this is part of the threat integration centers that they've set up in all 50 states
[43:13.740 --> 43:17.740]  and they have subgroups. And, and I've seen this in every state. This was written by the
[43:17.740 --> 43:22.380]  ADL of the Southern poverty law center. In fact, this is, you can go to the ADL and Southern
[43:22.380 --> 43:26.980]  poverty law center site and different pages, different sections. You can just Google the
[43:26.980 --> 43:31.860]  terms and Google the paragraphs and you won't just, you won't pull up the Mayak because
[43:31.860 --> 43:36.940]  we just put it up yesterday. We have the scans up. You will pull up ADL and Southern poverty
[43:36.940 --> 43:40.820]  law center. So, so this is just lifted directly from that. And they admit that in and they
[43:40.820 --> 43:45.300]  say it comes from other private sources and they just compile it and they lay it into
[43:45.300 --> 43:52.940]  here. And so this is just unbelievably outrageous. Now specifically you also asked what the first
[43:52.940 --> 43:56.580]  guy's first name was and he wouldn't tell you. He just told you his last name. And then
[43:56.580 --> 44:00.500]  you asked the other state police officer that they put you through to what his name was
[44:00.500 --> 44:06.140]  and he wouldn't tell you the, the, the other troopers first name, but he would tell you
[44:06.140 --> 44:07.140]  his first name.
[44:07.140 --> 44:12.380]  Yeah. He told me his name. He said, this is Lieutenant John Hoates. And it's funny on
[44:12.380 --> 44:18.820]  the bottom. It says, no report or segment thereof may be released to any media source.
[44:18.820 --> 44:22.180]  Why? What's wrong with that? Shouldn't we all be informed to be looking out for these
[44:22.180 --> 44:23.180]  dangerous people?
[44:23.180 --> 44:28.500]  Well, it says Ron Paul stickers. I mean, you got a Ron Paul sticker. You've got a don't
[44:28.500 --> 44:33.420]  tread on me sticker. Libertarian material. If you've seen Zeitgeist, which is the version
[44:33.420 --> 44:38.580]  that I'm all over basically my film, a large portions, and then America freedom fascism
[44:38.580 --> 44:43.340]  and then they put it right next to the Turner diaries, which was what the feds planted on
[44:43.340 --> 44:48.660]  McVeigh and what, you know, a white supremacist deal that calls for basically blasting and
[44:48.660 --> 44:53.500]  killing and, you know, race war and dead cops. Nothing about that and Zeitgeist, which is
[44:53.500 --> 44:57.780]  kind of a, you know, new age PC angle on what we do. Then you've got America freedom to
[44:57.780 --> 45:05.780]  fascism made by a Jews died of cancer. Great guy, Aaron Russo. And then you've got the
[45:05.780 --> 45:10.460]  Turner diaries. It says America freedom to fascism, anti income tax film. How dare them
[45:10.460 --> 45:14.660]  zeitgeist the movie anti federal reserve film, Turner diaries novel that depicts the
[45:14.660 --> 45:20.100]  violent revolution of the United States government and a war that leaves only a white population.
[45:20.100 --> 45:24.060]  This book was promoted by Timothy McVeigh and said to be motivation behind the Oklahoma
[45:24.060 --> 45:25.060]  city bombing.
[45:25.060 --> 45:28.980]  Oh, promoted. So he went on a book tour for it or something. So see the idea. Well, actually
[45:28.980 --> 45:34.180]  they didn't send him out on a ledger tour on history. He went to every patriot group,
[45:34.180 --> 45:38.020]  big gun show because it came out. The feds carried out the bombing to then try to link
[45:38.020 --> 45:42.180]  it to that and talk radio. Of course, it blew up in your face terrorist. You know, we exposed
[45:42.180 --> 45:45.220]  you killed your own feds. It's an absolute documented fact. And by the way, I've been
[45:45.220 --> 45:48.500]  in multiple SWAT team offices and places over the years like the Travis County SWAT team
[45:48.500 --> 45:54.220]  and seen the O K C bombing covered up in my films and other film people made on the shelves.
[45:54.220 --> 45:56.940]  And I've been in other police departments and looked and seen my films and they look,
[45:56.940 --> 46:01.380]  they all know you did it. They know your murderers. Okay. It goes on here. It says political
[46:01.380 --> 46:05.900]  paraphernalia. And that's what they said when they pull over Abby Newman in road to tyranny
[46:05.900 --> 46:09.260]  and the state police checkpoint in Virginia, no criminal record buying canning supplies
[46:09.260 --> 46:12.460]  in town. They said, we want to, you know, search it. She says, this is a warrantless
[46:12.460 --> 46:16.220]  checkpoint. They had these cars stopped. They grab her out, slammer against the car, put
[46:16.220 --> 46:20.300]  her in handcuffs and they get out the pocket constitution. My film police state 2000 and
[46:20.300 --> 46:24.060]  they start hyperventilating going, we got one of the extremists. I can't believe it.
[46:24.060 --> 46:29.540]  I'm not sure this is legal. Yeah. Yeah. And they said, I can't look at this paraphernalia.
[46:29.540 --> 46:34.180]  So we see the training on the streets. Militia members most commonly associated with third
[46:34.180 --> 46:40.540]  party political groups is uncommon for militia members to display constitutional party campaign
[46:40.540 --> 46:45.300]  for liberty or libertarian material. Oh, how campaign for liberty. These are, I mean, this
[46:45.300 --> 46:50.420]  is evil. These members are usually supporters of former presidential candidate Ron Paul,
[46:50.420 --> 46:55.420]  Chuck Baldwin or Bob Barr. You know, they've done national studies with a majority of Americans.
[46:55.420 --> 47:00.660]  Today they'll vote for a Democrat or Republican that over 50% call themselves libertarian.
[47:00.660 --> 47:05.940]  So see half the population are terrorist. Anti-government propaganda, militia members commonly display
[47:05.940 --> 47:12.460]  picture cartoons, bumper stickers. It's anti-government propaganda, bumper stickers that contain anti-government
[47:12.460 --> 47:18.340]  rhetoric. Most of this material will depict the FRS IRS, FBI, ATF, CIA, UN law enforcement
[47:18.340 --> 47:23.060]  in the new world order in a derogatory manner. How dare I depict the bankers openly bankrupting
[47:23.060 --> 47:26.260]  everything and setting up quote, a bank of the world that will pay taxes to how dare
[47:26.260 --> 47:31.260]  us bunch of Madoffs. Additionally, a radical anti-immigration and anti-abortion material
[47:31.260 --> 47:37.300]  may be displayed by militia members. You mean, you mean 91% in Gallup polls that say they
[47:37.300 --> 47:42.780]  want to shut down the border and 80% in Gallup polls of Hispanics. You mean those radicals?
[47:42.780 --> 47:47.620]  Well, an anti-immigration. I don't think anybody's against anti-immigration. They're against
[47:47.620 --> 47:48.620]  illegal immigration.
[47:48.620 --> 47:55.620]  Well, I mean, exactly. But I mean, they show, if they display American flags, look out.
[47:55.620 --> 48:02.460]  If they display the don't tread on me, the Gadsden flag, and it says created by General
[48:02.460 --> 48:09.100]  Christopher Gadsden. Is that Gadsden and utilized in colonial America? This is the most common
[48:09.100 --> 48:18.220]  symbol displayed by militia members and organizations. Now, so here they are demonizing militias.
[48:18.220 --> 48:23.260]  They don't even have a National Guard till what 1901, 1902. It is the posse, the sheriff
[48:23.260 --> 48:26.980]  calls out. It's the fact that we're armed as all the founding fathers said to protect
[48:26.980 --> 48:31.140]  ourselves from common criminals and tyrannical government as the Declaration of Independent
[48:31.140 --> 48:37.340]  States. And so they are, this is an illegal criminal government openly waging war on people
[48:37.340 --> 48:40.620]  that follow the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and you dovetail this with the other
[48:40.620 --> 48:46.180]  training manuals that say, if you pull somebody over and they talk about the, make frequent
[48:46.180 --> 48:50.220]  reverences in the U.S. Constitution, go ahead and take them in because they're probably
[48:50.220 --> 48:54.780]  terrorist. I mean, I've seen that in on the rack law enforcement magazines. I mean, if
[48:54.780 --> 48:59.460]  you just folks, all of you should dive into researching even the open source stuff, write
[48:59.460 --> 49:04.140]  your own article, send them to us, we'll post and put them on the prison planet forum because
[49:04.140 --> 49:07.940]  I'm so busy doing other things. I don't even, see, I've gotten conditioned to not even cover
[49:07.940 --> 49:16.700]  this because it's just so second hand to me of second nature. It's just so I'm so immersed
[49:16.700 --> 49:20.580]  in it that we all know this here, but the public doesn't, but I tend to not make as
[49:20.580 --> 49:24.940]  big a deal out of this as we should. People think I exaggerate. I tend to not cover the
[49:24.940 --> 49:30.260]  severity and how serious Alex you're exaggerating. There's bombings and rocket attacks and thousands
[49:30.260 --> 49:34.580]  dead in Mexico and that it's so dangerous five years ago. Now it's all admitted. No,
[49:34.580 --> 49:38.980]  we just are informed and spend our time researching recap. But though for those listening to state
[49:38.980 --> 49:45.740]  police of Missouri, confirm that yes, this indeed is what they give their officers. Run
[49:45.740 --> 49:52.420]  back through it quickly. Yeah. So anyway, I called, uh, let's see. I called the Missouri
[49:52.420 --> 49:57.980]  Information Analysis Center and I got a number for a captain hole and I called him. He's
[49:57.980 --> 50:01.620]  at the state highway patrol and, uh, I want to see if he wanted to come on and talk about
[50:01.620 --> 50:06.100]  the MIAC strategic report and gave him the date and I said, we got this in and if he's
[50:06.100 --> 50:09.900]  interested in coming on, talking about it, we'd love to talk about it. And, uh, he confirmed
[50:09.900 --> 50:14.540]  that it was theirs and it's, uh, he wanted to give me a quote in the beginning. You know,
[50:14.540 --> 50:19.660]  well, this is, this is what it is. And he says it was normal operation for officers
[50:19.660 --> 50:25.340]  and that's his quote. And, uh, to receive these reports for a quote, safety purposes
[50:25.340 --> 50:30.860]  and to track trends or changes. And he said more, but that's what I wrote down. So that's
[50:30.860 --> 50:36.180]  all I want to say that he quoted, um, you know, no, no, it's okay. Let's not be neurotic
[50:36.180 --> 50:39.260]  about this. I'm not saying you, I mean, no, no, come back and tell us. I know you're
[50:39.260 --> 50:43.540]  trying to write as fast as you could. You can paraphrase reporters do that. Right. Basically
[50:43.540 --> 50:47.860]  what else he told you, we went all of it. I'm going to squeeze every drop of information
[50:47.860 --> 50:51.620]  out of you. Rob, do prepare to be interrogated on air when we get back. Yikes. You will be
[50:51.620 --> 50:56.580]  interrogated. I'm Alex Jones. The Obama deception can now be viewed at prisonplanet.tv and downloaded

[52:03.660 --> 52:09.300]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to have a civilian national security force
[52:09.300 --> 52:15.900]  that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded. The Obama deception completely
[52:15.900 --> 52:20.580]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[52:20.580 --> 52:26.140]  Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue
[52:26.140 --> 52:31.300]  with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a
[52:31.300 --> 52:38.260]  group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right.
[52:38.260 --> 52:43.860]  It's about a one-world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he
[52:43.860 --> 52:50.420]  is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at info wars

[54:07.460 --> 54:14.780]  Okay so the state police, two different officers from the number we called confirmed. That's
[54:14.780 --> 54:20.820]  right. And he decides who to free and who to blame. And so it's confirmed we're gonna
[54:20.820 --> 54:25.380]  go over it more in the next hour. I'm gonna take some calls, get into Cheney, ran SS-style
[54:25.380 --> 54:30.780]  political assassination team that's mainstream news. It's all part of the freedom. And now
[54:30.780 --> 54:35.340]  their memos are public where they wanted to have a dictatorship and arrest people for
[54:35.340 --> 54:39.740]  free speech and ban free speech. And they said the president could do that and now Obama
[54:39.740 --> 54:45.140]  agrees and is expanding those powers. I mean, will Obama put a crown on and declare himself
[54:45.140 --> 54:51.660]  God and the media will say that's right, presidents are God? I mean, could if the president, according
[54:51.660 --> 54:56.060]  has this unlimited right of kings, I guess he could commit any crown he wants. And the
[54:56.060 --> 54:59.540]  state police, if you talk about it, you know the feds are there teaching them it's illegal.
[54:59.540 --> 55:05.580]  It's terrorism, Ron Paul's bad. Remember Glenn Beck? I said that was a talking point. I saw
[55:05.580 --> 55:09.620]  it all over every cable news show. These Ron Paul supporters are dangerous. The army and
[55:09.620 --> 55:13.420]  police need to be used against them. And now he acts like he's our best friend because
[55:13.420 --> 55:16.820]  they realize we're the majority and we're taken over. The people are taking the country
[55:16.820 --> 55:20.060]  back through the political process and through free speech.
[55:20.060 --> 55:25.260]  And he said his ratings have increased since he started with his new format, you know.
[55:25.260 --> 55:29.580]  You know, acting like a patriot, right? But he slips in, get Iran, get Iran. Terrace is
[55:29.580 --> 55:32.780]  going to get you. Al-Qaeda is everywhere. But boy, I don't like that new world order.
[55:32.780 --> 55:37.580]  Right. People are like, I like, you know, Alex, I don't see what you're saying. Okay,
[55:37.580 --> 55:46.460]  if you want to be suckered, go ahead. But continuing here, Rob, I mean, I understand
[55:46.460 --> 55:50.180]  you scribbled notes. You were being specific with those, but no, tell us what else he said.
[55:50.180 --> 55:56.460]  All right. Well, he went into, I'll go back over again. He said that the strategic report,
[55:56.460 --> 56:01.140]  he confirmed that they put that out. And then he said that it's a normal operation for officers
[56:01.140 --> 56:06.940]  to receive these periodic reports for safety purposes and to track trends or changes. And
[56:06.940 --> 56:09.620]  I understand that's what you wrote, but you're saying he said too much. You couldn't ride
[56:09.620 --> 56:15.340]  it all. I mean, he was 20 minutes ago. Tell us. Yeah. Well, and he said they put it out
[56:15.340 --> 56:21.180]  and it's for safety purposes to train their officers. What else did he say? He was, uh,
[56:21.180 --> 56:25.220]  I was mainly asking him a lot of questions. I asked him, um, I was trying to get him on
[56:25.220 --> 56:28.380]  the show and he was asking me where, where the show was, when it was, he asked us where
[56:28.380 --> 56:33.860]  we were located and, uh, you said we're out of Texas and then you asked him, uh, could
[56:33.860 --> 56:38.100]  you tell me outside or in the break that, Hey, uh, is this a threat in Texas? We liked
[56:38.100 --> 56:43.500]  it. Yeah. I kind of pretended I was a little country dumb. And, uh, I said, uh, yeah, you
[56:43.500 --> 56:47.180]  know, is this something we need to be worried about in Texas? And, uh, cause this, I, this
[56:47.180 --> 56:51.260]  I'm kind of scared. I'm looking at this and you know, talking about modern militias and
[56:51.260 --> 56:56.820]  being terrorists. And he's like, well, um, um, uh, he said, well, uh, I think we, yeah,
[56:56.820 --> 57:00.300]  we can come on and talk about it. And he goes, let me talk to my superior and I'll call you
[57:00.300 --> 57:05.580]  right back. And, um, you know, it was a pretty short conversation. I got his information.
[57:05.580 --> 57:09.540]  He's a captain with the Missouri state highway patrol. He didn't give me his first name.
[57:09.540 --> 57:16.900]  Um, and, um, but give us the last. It was captain hall, HUL, like the whole of a ship.
[57:16.900 --> 57:22.460]  And they're, they're actually, that's a different number than, uh, than the number on the, on
[57:22.460 --> 57:27.140]  the back on page seven, but go ahead and give them captain Hall's numbers. All right. All
[57:27.140 --> 57:32.660]  right. Let's do it. Uh, five, seven, three, five, two, six, six, one, one, five. That's
[57:32.660 --> 57:38.940]  five, seven, three, five, two, six, six, one, one, five. Um, and please be polite folks.
[57:38.940 --> 57:43.540]  Yeah. If any of you dimwits out there that are saying we're making this up, there you
[57:43.540 --> 57:46.180]  go, buddy, put your money where your mouth is. There's the phone number.
[57:46.180 --> 57:50.260]  Call captain hall. Give them the other guy's name. The other guy's name is Lieutenant John
[57:50.260 --> 57:57.260]  Hoates, HOTZ. Um, what else did he say? Well, John, uh, Lieutenant John Hoates called me
[57:57.260 --> 58:02.020]  back and said, uh, hi, is this Rob? And I said, yeah, this is Rob. Um, he said, well,
[58:02.020 --> 58:06.020]  I'm calling on behalf of captain hall. He will not be able to make it on your radio program
[58:06.020 --> 58:10.100]  today. And I said, Oh, okay. Well, would you like to come on? And he said, Oh, no, no,
[58:10.100 --> 58:14.100]  no, no. After under a meeting, we already covered that. Anything else we didn't that
[58:14.100 --> 58:17.740]  that's pretty much it. It was a short conversation. They were, uh, you know, they were all very
[58:17.740 --> 58:21.420]  polite, but you know, they don't want to talk about it. They want to hide in the shadows.
[58:21.420 --> 58:26.140]  Give me a favor. Yeah, go sit in your office for five minutes. Think if anything else was
[58:26.140 --> 58:30.020]  said, all right, believe me, more was said, think, no, no, no, I mean, this is how it
[58:30.020 --> 58:35.060]  always is. Remember, go back to the conversation. We got to rig that up with a recorder back
[58:35.060 --> 58:37.820]  there for those type of interviews. You can tell them, Hey, I'm calling from the news
[58:37.820 --> 58:42.980]  and it's okay to record them. All right, here we go. We'll be right back. Thank you for

[58:52.340 --> 58:56.180]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self sufficient. And today that's more
[58:56.180 --> 59:00.380]  important than ever. We need to be independent and food and water is the key. You'll never
[59:00.380 --> 59:04.020]  have to stand in a bread line. You have your own bread. You'll never have to go to the
[59:04.020 --> 59:08.620]  Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency. If you simply
[59:08.620 --> 59:12.820]  prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you know,

[1:00:18.020 --> 1:00:24.540]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:24.540 --> 1:00:29.340]  We are back live and yes, it's as bad as we always said it was with the New World Order.
[1:00:29.340 --> 1:00:34.700]  This is confirmed every day. In fact, it's worse. But the good news is the people are
[1:00:34.700 --> 1:00:39.100]  waking up in droves and we have a lot of military and police contacting us that are just flipping
[1:00:39.100 --> 1:00:43.340]  out by what they're being told. The Founding Fathers are terrorists. They are going to
[1:00:43.340 --> 1:00:47.220]  have to put Americans in camps. They are going to have martial law for our own good. Foreign
[1:00:47.220 --> 1:00:50.900]  troops will probably be here. And they try to train them with the troops. They're putting
[1:00:50.900 --> 1:00:57.140]  military into all the police departments. Folks are waking up. And things are going to get
[1:00:57.140 --> 1:01:01.340]  a lot worse before they get better. But just, we planted all the seeds, ticking time bombs
[1:01:01.340 --> 1:01:07.740]  in the Info War. You see a lot of them exploding daily. That's nothing. As things get worse,
[1:01:07.740 --> 1:01:14.340]  the Info Bombs will just detonate and not hurt people, but unlock mines. The Red Pill
[1:01:14.340 --> 1:01:20.260]  has launched. The Obama Deception has launched at PrisonPlanet.TV. I launched it four days
[1:01:20.260 --> 1:01:26.260]  early. And we did that for a lot of different reasons. We were worried about seeding and
[1:01:26.260 --> 1:01:29.500]  server loads. We wanted to test it out without a lot of folks. None was launching. Worked
[1:01:29.500 --> 1:01:33.380]  great. Downloads are super quick. The streams are super fast. People are blown away. Some
[1:01:33.380 --> 1:01:37.740]  people are downloading the film in 10 minutes. It's a bunch of different versions and qualities
[1:01:37.740 --> 1:01:45.020]  up there. But it's just amazing to watch it at PrisonPlanet.TV. And by the way, the Alex
[1:01:45.020 --> 1:01:48.620]  Jones Channel, which was not the official Alex Jones channel, but we work with the
[1:01:48.620 --> 1:01:52.020]  guy that has it now and have kind of taken it over, but he's still running at Dave doing
[1:01:52.020 --> 1:02:01.820]  a fabulous job. We appreciate all his work. It is now the number one YouTube channel.
[1:02:01.820 --> 1:02:09.060]  Number one. I mean, you can go to, I didn't know this till about 30 minutes ago. Paul
[1:02:09.060 --> 1:02:16.860]  Watson sent me the link and I, Paul, post that in the link or Nemo or somebody should
[1:02:16.860 --> 1:02:30.300]  do a blurb on it. But number one YouTube channel. Numero uno. Numero uno. So that is very,
[1:02:30.300 --> 1:02:40.420]  very, very exciting. And it's just growing and growing. And that's only one of hundreds
[1:02:40.420 --> 1:02:44.780]  of YouTube sites that post the radio show, the TV show. And that's just YouTube, not
[1:02:44.780 --> 1:02:50.140]  the BitTorrents, not the hundreds of other video sites. But we still use YouTube, even
[1:02:50.140 --> 1:02:54.860]  though they're starting to censor and manipulate because we know that that is a fertile ground
[1:02:54.860 --> 1:02:59.660]  to reach people and wake folks up. We still use that as a vector point in the viral distribution
[1:02:59.660 --> 1:03:04.560]  of the truth. So I'm telling you, YouTube is the, that's why they're basically shutting
[1:03:04.560 --> 1:03:08.420]  down Google video. They don't even have it on their page, sub page. You can hardly find
[1:03:08.420 --> 1:03:13.580]  it. You've got to have the old URL. They delete, they've been uploading videos of
[1:03:13.580 --> 1:03:17.980]  Burmese just talking and they're deleting them. So they're starting to move into that
[1:03:17.980 --> 1:03:24.820]  with YouTube. The answer is don't back down, infested even more with the truth, but then
[1:03:24.820 --> 1:03:33.180]  doppelgang post the videos, the audios, always in two or three sub alternate sites. See, when
[1:03:33.180 --> 1:03:38.340]  the enemy starts coming after you and trying to restrict you and shut you down, that means
[1:03:38.340 --> 1:03:44.620]  you're hurting them. You know, when we're getting death threats and got the FBI calling
[1:03:44.620 --> 1:03:50.100]  here snooping around, oh, that's just wonderful because that lets us know we are right in
[1:03:50.100 --> 1:03:54.660]  there engaging the new order when most of the state police intelligence files they put
[1:03:54.660 --> 1:04:00.420]  out through the feds, feds put out through the state police. It's all about gun owners
[1:04:00.420 --> 1:04:05.020]  are bad and constitutionalist are bad and they want to kill officers and they're with
[1:04:05.020 --> 1:04:10.620]  what supremist and all this guilt by association. That means we are hurting them bad and they're
[1:04:10.620 --> 1:04:14.460]  worried about their officers waking up and going, man, I want to follow my oath. I want
[1:04:14.460 --> 1:04:18.500]  to be a patriot. I want to be like the founding fathers. You know, these guys are right. Everything
[1:04:18.500 --> 1:04:21.940]  they said came true. I mean, they're openly announcing a world government run by banks.
[1:04:21.940 --> 1:04:27.020]  I think I'm just going to follow Bill Wright's constitution. They're like, no, no. I mean,
[1:04:27.020 --> 1:04:33.020]  the ADL is the main group that has been caught and been convicted of taking over areas of
[1:04:33.020 --> 1:04:37.700]  the police departments and intelligence units and stealing files on people and spying through
[1:04:37.700 --> 1:04:42.500]  the police on citizens. The Southern probably law center was caught in FBI documents that
[1:04:42.500 --> 1:04:49.820]  have been declassified basically running the Elohim city white supremacist compound. Oh,
[1:04:49.820 --> 1:04:55.220]  it's disgusting. It's just no, no, we're not you. Let's get that straight. Don't try to
[1:04:55.220 --> 1:05:01.460]  claim the Patriots are you. We're not the ones hanging out with the white supremacist.
[1:05:01.460 --> 1:05:06.100]  These continue to lay off thousands of people. Unemployment is the highest it's been in
[1:05:06.100 --> 1:05:12.580]  over 30 years. Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up. Everyone needs something
[1:05:12.580 --> 1:05:18.100]  for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[1:05:18.100 --> 1:05:24.140]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray available at MrDefense.com. DPS is the
[1:05:24.140 --> 1:05:28.500]  strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement
[1:05:28.500 --> 1:05:33.220]  agencies around the world. Need something more? The scorpion stun gun is a great way

[1:06:01.740 --> 1:06:07.660]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've
[1:06:07.660 --> 1:06:13.820]  got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just
[1:06:13.820 --> 1:06:19.540]  as well funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[1:06:19.540 --> 1:06:28.500]  the best interests of the American people. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass
[1:06:28.500 --> 1:06:34.780]  movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers
[1:06:34.780 --> 1:06:40.020]  and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one
[1:06:40.020 --> 1:06:46.380]  world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and

[1:07:01.420 --> 1:07:05.740]  You worry. You see the signs and worry about the future. You worry about economic turmoil
[1:07:05.740 --> 1:07:09.860]  and food shortages. How to be prepared while preserving your sanity. Your answer may be

[1:07:19.100 --> 1:07:23.860]  earth. Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants. The cost
[1:07:23.860 --> 1:07:28.420]  of learning is minimal. Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere. It's every
[1:07:28.420 --> 1:07:33.260]  bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets. Well respected in her field, Linda's

[1:08:01.020 --> 1:08:06.940]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[1:08:06.940 --> 1:08:14.940]  a war on for your mind. Okay, the Mayak State Police federally written report that Ron Paul's
[1:08:14.940 --> 1:08:19.500]  supporters are all basically terrorists that want to kill police and that all libertarians
[1:08:19.500 --> 1:08:23.580]  are basically terrorists and anybody that doesn't like the New World Order is a terrorist.
[1:08:23.580 --> 1:08:26.140]  It's confirmed, we've talked to the state police, we've put out their names and info,
[1:08:26.140 --> 1:08:29.340]  we're going to add that to the articles and Paul's right, another big one right now.
[1:08:29.340 --> 1:08:34.620]  I'm going to take calls and then we're going to get into Hirsch. Shanie ran SS-style political
[1:08:34.620 --> 1:08:41.580]  assassination unit himself. So we'll get into that. Also, two arrested and FBI-rated Obama
[1:08:41.580 --> 1:08:48.300]  appointees office. I mean, it's just a pack of criminals. And a sorry and a shame Bernie
[1:08:48.300 --> 1:08:54.060]  Madoff pleads guilty. Oh my goodness. The artificial life could be created within five years on the
[1:08:54.060 --> 1:09:01.500]  Telegraph. I will get to those stories and more after we take some calls. But it's all an illusion.
[1:09:01.500 --> 1:09:07.020]  It's like a spell. It's a mind game. It's a confidence game that you have these criminal
[1:09:07.020 --> 1:09:11.820]  bankers that created giant worldwide Ponzi schemes. They brag to bankrupt the planet,
[1:09:11.820 --> 1:09:15.900]  bring in a one world government you'll pay your taxes to. It's all over the newspapers.
[1:09:15.900 --> 1:09:21.420]  They admit they're doing it and their state police manuals everywhere saying we're insane.
[1:09:21.420 --> 1:09:27.180]  It doesn't exist. We're terrorists. I mean, they can't get away with this. This will wake anybody
[1:09:27.180 --> 1:09:32.860]  up. It's so obvious. It's waking the police up. It's waking the military up. Ron Paul got
[1:09:32.860 --> 1:09:37.100]  more money from the military than any other candidate in either party. I kept seeing Republicans.
[1:09:37.100 --> 1:09:47.500]  No, I was corrected. It's any party. Unbelievable. He raised six something million in one day.
[1:09:47.500 --> 1:09:53.660]  Like half of it was military. All-time record, broken, beating Kerry's previous record,
[1:09:53.660 --> 1:09:58.700]  beating Obama's record, beating Hillary's records. And so you go ahead, tell the military, Ron Paul's
[1:09:58.700 --> 1:10:03.420]  supporters are terrorists and he's bad and tell people American freedom to fascism is bad.
[1:10:03.420 --> 1:10:08.300]  And of course you want to sneak around on the dark and tell these lies and spew all of this.
[1:10:08.860 --> 1:10:13.260]  But your own state police aren't going to go along with you. Jigs up.
[1:10:15.340 --> 1:10:19.340]  And if we just recognize who's financially raping us and doing all this to us,
[1:10:19.340 --> 1:10:24.460]  it can stop. It can stop. If we just get the yuppies and all the wannabe establishment people
[1:10:24.460 --> 1:10:29.180]  to realize that yuppies are into being empowered and nothing touches them and everything's a joke
[1:10:29.180 --> 1:10:34.700]  and they just don't care. And so are the phony mainline Christians that have been told stand
[1:10:34.700 --> 1:10:37.900]  down. It's the end of the world. Praise God. They're trying to make us take chips. That
[1:10:37.900 --> 1:10:43.260]  means Jesus is coming. Well, morally, you know, regardless of what's really going on,
[1:10:43.260 --> 1:10:47.020]  you got a moral responsibility to fight evil and warn others. But no, you just
[1:10:47.020 --> 1:10:51.740]  hide in your churches and, you know, do your hair up and get all dolled up in the men,
[1:10:51.740 --> 1:10:56.220]  get all dressed up and then you just all nitty around and have your preacher tell you Obama's
[1:10:56.220 --> 1:11:01.660]  God and the government's God and with their FEMA funding. If we can just break the illusion
[1:11:02.700 --> 1:11:07.340]  with the liberals thinking Obama's God and black folks thinking is God and, you know,
[1:11:07.340 --> 1:11:11.980]  Christians thinking the government's God and the yuppies not caring. And because the yuppie
[1:11:11.980 --> 1:11:14.620]  doesn't want to admit they're threatened by something. They don't want to admit they're not
[1:11:14.620 --> 1:11:17.340]  in control of everything. They don't want to admit there's something they got to do.
[1:11:18.460 --> 1:11:21.820]  I mean, I've seen the response a million times, you know, and I'm not bashing you if you drive a
[1:11:21.820 --> 1:11:27.340]  BMW and, you know, wear tennis outfits to dinner. But the point is I run into them all the time
[1:11:27.340 --> 1:11:30.700]  at Austin or they come up and make jokes. Oh, black helicopters going to get me. Oh, and I go,
[1:11:30.700 --> 1:11:33.820]  Hey, do you like the toll roads going in? They said they weren't going to put in on the roads.
[1:11:33.820 --> 1:11:37.660]  Well, so what? You know, it's just all right. Well, they're putting the satellite tracker
[1:11:37.660 --> 1:11:41.500]  boxes in the cars here in Austin trying to push everybody getting them the taxes by the mile.
[1:11:41.500 --> 1:11:47.740]  And I'll enjoy it then. You know, it's okay, idiot. You're asking to be raped by tyranny.
[1:11:47.740 --> 1:11:53.500]  I mean, when you act like that and you run around in a delusional fashion, you are courting disaster.
[1:11:53.500 --> 1:12:01.900]  In fact, you're guaranteeing disaster. The child like two year old like denial. When you tell a
[1:12:01.900 --> 1:12:07.340]  child that the Easter Bunny doesn't exist or or or Spider-Man isn't real or Superman isn't real
[1:12:07.340 --> 1:12:12.540]  or Santa Claus isn't real. It's got to end. I mean, you're telling us none of this exists as
[1:12:12.540 --> 1:12:20.300]  it's openly being announced. There's no more time. These people are dangerous running things.
[1:12:20.300 --> 1:12:26.460]  They stage terror attacks. They don't care about a million 300,000 dead Iraqis. Bubba.
[1:12:26.460 --> 1:12:29.820]  And if they can train, you do not care about them. They'll make the move on all of us. You
[1:12:29.820 --> 1:12:37.660]  understand that? These are greedy, wicked, sociopathic, psychopathic sadists. And they need
[1:12:37.660 --> 1:12:43.340]  good men and women to be suckered in to going along with them with the with the excuses and the,
[1:12:43.340 --> 1:12:47.820]  you know, we're doing it for the good of the people and for the children garbage. They paper over
[1:12:48.460 --> 1:12:54.460]  their operations with, but the paper is falling off. It's hanging off by the glue. Everybody
[1:12:54.460 --> 1:12:59.340]  sees what it is. The curtain's being pulled aside. Whatever a parable or analogy you want to use.
[1:13:00.380 --> 1:13:03.900]  So that's all coming up as well. But I'll say it again. The Obama deception is now out at prison

[1:13:18.060 --> 1:13:20.220]  Ryan in Canada. Thanks for holding her on the year.
[1:13:20.220 --> 1:13:26.220]  Hello? Yes, sir. You turn your radio off, please.
[1:13:26.220 --> 1:13:29.420]  Hi, how's it going? Good. I'm going to ask you to turn your radio off.
[1:13:29.420 --> 1:13:31.020]  It's off. Okay, go ahead.
[1:13:31.820 --> 1:13:36.460]  Sorry, I was just calling to let you know that up here in Quebec there, I've been snooping around
[1:13:36.460 --> 1:13:40.780]  the far enough army base for quite a while and they've done a lot of upgrading to it.
[1:13:40.780 --> 1:13:45.660]  They're playing smart, but I'm pretty sure it's being prepared as a camp here in lower sir.
[1:13:45.660 --> 1:13:51.180]  Your mainstream news admitted they're preparing camps, preparing to cordon and lock citizens in.
[1:13:51.180 --> 1:13:56.220]  It was in major papers two days ago that they are preparing to wage war against the people of Canada
[1:13:56.220 --> 1:14:01.580]  and Canada is now under North com control. You've already, look, look, oh my gosh, I just forgot
[1:14:01.580 --> 1:14:06.860]  about guys, will you please bring me the France re-enters NATO article? I printed it last night.
[1:14:06.860 --> 1:14:11.180]  I don't see it here in my stack. It's Burma's ran off with it. Sir, go ahead and make your
[1:14:11.180 --> 1:14:15.340]  point. I'll shut up and basically they're doing the same thing up here. They're trying to censor
[1:14:15.340 --> 1:14:20.140]  us. They're trying to take stuff off the internet, play with the mail, take books out of the bookstores,
[1:14:20.140 --> 1:14:26.220]  things like that. And they're trying to demonize anybody who's not going along with the agenda.
[1:14:26.220 --> 1:14:30.220]  I noticed the big politicians up here, they scream a lot about protectionism.
[1:14:30.780 --> 1:14:35.980]  And so I get to point out to people around me that the only thing, there's no demonization in it.
[1:14:35.980 --> 1:14:40.700]  We protect ourselves and our communities and all the small groups that talk about this.
[1:14:40.700 --> 1:14:44.460]  That's all they ever come out with is that if we want to help ourselves, we go back local.
[1:14:44.460 --> 1:14:49.260]  But you've got all these, our major politicians kind of crying, saying that it's their worst
[1:14:49.260 --> 1:14:54.220]  fear in the world. And I can easily explain to people, I've got three prime ministers up here
[1:14:54.220 --> 1:15:00.140]  that they took groups of a hundred businessmen over to China to sign contracts. And so when we
[1:15:00.140 --> 1:15:05.500]  stop buying all the dollar store stuff and all the Walmart stuff and we go local, it hurts them,
[1:15:05.500 --> 1:15:08.540]  hurts the politicians and the Chinese businessmen. I hear you.
[1:15:08.540 --> 1:15:10.700]  That little group, you know, but it doesn't hurt us.
[1:15:10.700 --> 1:15:14.380]  Ryan, good job. I appreciate your call. What they're going to do is that when they fully
[1:15:14.380 --> 1:15:18.300]  abroad in the depression, they're then going to erect tariffs and say that did it. And they'll
[1:15:18.300 --> 1:15:23.340]  put that in the history books. They always do that. This isn't free trade to have Chinese slaves,
[1:15:23.340 --> 1:15:30.060]  millions of them working in slave wages or physical slaves in over 700 camps that Walmart buys from
[1:15:30.060 --> 1:15:34.860]  alone, forced labor camps that make the kids in school at age 10, go and work in the factories.
[1:15:34.860 --> 1:15:41.020]  You always hear about them blowing up the firecracker factories, fireworks factories. And so it's
[1:15:41.020 --> 1:15:45.740]  about deindustrialization. So the globalists can deindustrialize the West and they've done
[1:15:45.740 --> 1:15:51.020]  their great job destroying our countries. But speaking of military occupation,
[1:15:53.020 --> 1:15:59.100]  Hitler did invade Czechoslovakia, Danzig, Poland. He did take those over with military force.
[1:15:59.100 --> 1:16:03.900]  There was resistance, but he didn't really race around the Magina line. They did,
[1:16:03.900 --> 1:16:07.180]  but at Dunkirk where the British all evacuated and were told to leave,
[1:16:08.620 --> 1:16:15.980]  there was a pre-made deal with the majority of the French brass in Vici, France, that
[1:16:16.860 --> 1:16:23.580]  smaller city to stand down. And then that's why Hitler came and looked at Paris for one day
[1:16:23.580 --> 1:16:27.500]  and left. And there were hardly even any German troops there until the allies began to get ready
[1:16:27.500 --> 1:16:33.500]  for their invasion because it was the French Vici. It was traders within. So the French
[1:16:33.500 --> 1:16:39.500]  learned through that not to trust a big standing army. Well, the NATO basically occupied France
[1:16:39.500 --> 1:16:45.740]  until 63. For a decade, France asked NATO to let them run their own bases. There were assassinations
[1:16:45.740 --> 1:16:50.940]  in France. They tried to kill De Gaulle. NATO did. That's clearly, you know, in many of the
[1:16:50.940 --> 1:16:55.580]  research papers out there, De Gaulle went out at a press conference said, I'm kicking you out.
[1:16:55.580 --> 1:16:59.900]  It was a huge deal. That's what we started hearing all the anti-French propaganda. And they kicked
[1:16:59.900 --> 1:17:09.100]  NATO out. In 1963, Nicolas Sarkozy, who's not even French, France to rejoin NATO Corp.
[1:17:09.820 --> 1:17:14.460]  Nicolas Sarkozy officially announces the end of four decades of armed links relationship
[1:17:14.460 --> 1:17:18.540]  with the transatlantic alliance. France will re-enter NATO's integrated military command.
[1:17:18.540 --> 1:17:22.860]  France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, announced this afternoon he said that the move was in
[1:17:22.860 --> 1:17:27.020]  the interest of France and of Europe. You see, you'd get a standing army in your country. It
[1:17:27.020 --> 1:17:33.020]  always takes over. That matter if it's Venezuela or the United States or France or Germany or
[1:17:33.020 --> 1:17:38.460]  Korea. This is what happens. This is what a leech do. This is how they operate. And that's all
[1:17:38.460 --> 1:17:43.180]  that's happened here with Northcom. Okay, we're just publicly occupied. They publicly say we're
[1:17:43.180 --> 1:17:48.140]  under their control and they work for Wall Street. Okay, Abraham in Washington, thanks for holding.
[1:17:48.140 --> 1:17:56.540]  Go ahead. Hey, Alex. How you doing today? Pretty good, sir. I actually have one point I want to
[1:17:56.540 --> 1:18:01.820]  make. It's on topic, but I just wanted to say something else before I say that. My wife came
[1:18:01.820 --> 1:18:07.260]  up with a joke about the stimulus package and about the IOUs that California's issuing. And
[1:18:07.260 --> 1:18:14.940]  that's Arnold saying, I'll pay you back. Yeah, they'll pay us back. All right. Yeah. Anyway,
[1:18:15.660 --> 1:18:22.060]  I want to make a point. I'm up here in Pullman, Washington. And I called you a couple of weeks
[1:18:22.060 --> 1:18:26.780]  ago about them putting in cameras monitored by the Pentagon. Yeah, they're putting them everywhere.
[1:18:27.980 --> 1:18:32.060]  Well, we managed to get that stopped in city council and I'm also going to be running for
[1:18:32.060 --> 1:18:35.980]  city council up here. I got one of the councilmen that asked me to run and he's
[1:18:36.700 --> 1:18:42.780]  Yeah, it's all over the newspapers in Washington state that the army is coming into all the major
[1:18:42.780 --> 1:18:47.980]  departments to be in the department. Go ahead. Right. Well, they're also putting in a bio weapons
[1:18:47.980 --> 1:18:56.380]  lab on the WSU campus up here. Yeah, level four. Right. And also, the thing that's on topic that
[1:18:56.380 --> 1:19:02.700]  I wanted to talk about my wife, her ex husband is a police officer up near Seattle and he's
[1:19:02.700 --> 1:19:10.460]  managed to basically get her kids completely away from her. And he's managed to use, you know,
[1:19:10.460 --> 1:19:16.220]  the law restraining orders and things like that. And with regards to that, though, we tried sending
[1:19:16.220 --> 1:19:22.060]  her kids some of your information and stuff. And he basically took it away and threw it away,
[1:19:22.060 --> 1:19:25.820]  including a copy of the constitution that you send out with all your videos. Oh, God,
[1:19:25.820 --> 1:19:31.500]  that's evil. I mean, they're actually taught that's bad. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're not joking
[1:19:31.500 --> 1:19:35.660]  when we say that we have it on video female teaching in this. They swear no to it, but it's bad.
[1:19:36.540 --> 1:19:40.140]  Tell me more about it when we come back briefly. And I'll can I got to hurry through calls because
[1:19:40.140 --> 1:19:44.860]  I want to get your reviews. I've got to ask this of the Obama deception. Jason Burmese had like

[1:21:01.500 --> 1:21:07.740]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've
[1:21:07.740 --> 1:21:12.700]  got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to
[1:21:12.700 --> 1:21:18.620]  see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:21:18.620 --> 1:21:24.300]  of the American people. While Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[1:21:24.300 --> 1:21:29.580]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:21:29.580 --> 1:21:35.340]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:21:35.340 --> 1:21:43.180]  It's not about left to right. It's about a one world government. This film documents who Obama
[1:21:43.180 --> 1:21:50.700]  works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today

[1:21:57.820 --> 1:22:03.500]  The people strike back. Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much
[1:22:03.500 --> 1:22:08.380]  about your financial affairs? I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank
[1:22:08.380 --> 1:22:13.020]  accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds. It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever
[1:22:13.020 --> 1:22:17.900]  again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Unfortunately, with the
[1:22:17.900 --> 1:22:23.260]  Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS revenue ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the
[1:22:23.260 --> 1:22:28.620]  Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order of 1933, some precious metal holdings
[1:22:28.620 --> 1:22:33.260]  are subject to government intervention. For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report
[1:22:33.260 --> 1:22:37.660]  explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately. Whether if you have any intention

[1:24:03.180 --> 1:24:09.100]  You know, it's very simple. We found out about the Globalist Takeover Plan. Old-timers, 50,
[1:24:09.100 --> 1:24:15.020]  60 years ago, it's been the Gradual National Security Council Shadow Government Takeover.
[1:24:15.020 --> 1:24:19.820]  The last 15 years, people have really been fighting it, and now we've warned the majority of the
[1:24:19.820 --> 1:24:24.620]  public that they didn't believe us at the time. Now they've seen it happen, and so your operation's
[1:24:24.620 --> 1:24:29.420]  been exposed. You're planned to fully overthrow the country, rob everybody through taxation and
[1:24:29.420 --> 1:24:34.780]  police state control. It's been exposed, but you don't care. Your criminal masters are just
[1:24:34.780 --> 1:24:40.940]  going forward with everything, so it's going to be one horrible collision. But at least we've
[1:24:40.940 --> 1:24:46.140]  got a fighting chance that we're not rolling over on our backsides, bearing our bellies to you.
[1:24:46.140 --> 1:24:51.020]  I've got to hurry through calls now. Abraham finished up what she was saying, so your
[1:24:51.020 --> 1:24:55.180]  wife's ex-husband, a police officer, she tried to send her children some material,
[1:24:55.180 --> 1:24:57.180]  and that's al-Qaeda, so he had to throw it away.
[1:24:58.780 --> 1:25:02.940]  Yeah, well, if you want to talk to her, she could tell you a little more in detail about
[1:25:02.940 --> 1:25:06.220]  some other things that he's done. I got her right here if you want to talk to her.
[1:25:06.220 --> 1:25:11.820]  Well, specifically, though, what did he say about the videos in the Constitution that he
[1:25:11.820 --> 1:25:17.020]  threw in the trash? Well, he said he was very offended by it, and he said that he didn't want
[1:25:17.020 --> 1:25:21.500]  his kids getting in trouble for reading the Constitution. But I heard some kind of an
[1:25:21.500 --> 1:25:26.780]  extremist for sending them the Constitution. Well, it's, you know, we got female tapes,
[1:25:26.780 --> 1:25:30.380]  and it's bad, so it must be. Doesn't he know he swore an oath to it?
[1:25:30.380 --> 1:25:36.620]  You know, I think he knows he swore an oath to it, but I just don't think he cares. He's very
[1:25:36.620 --> 1:25:41.820]  arrogant, and he's very rude, and he really doesn't care about the country.
[1:25:41.820 --> 1:25:45.740]  Yeah, well, a lot of bad people want to become officers, so they have power. There's a lot of
[1:25:45.740 --> 1:25:50.700]  good people that want to serve, but it's pathetic. I mean, unless you're, I don't want to make your
[1:25:50.700 --> 1:25:54.700]  wife come on the line. I mean, did she specifically talk to him about the thought crime that she
[1:25:54.700 --> 1:25:58.380]  committed by sending him the Constitution? Yeah, yeah, she did.
[1:25:58.380 --> 1:26:01.340]  Well, here, let me talk to her real quick. What's your wife's name?
[1:26:02.060 --> 1:26:02.860]  Sarah.
[1:26:02.860 --> 1:26:09.180]  Hey, Sarah, you sent, you sent him the pocket Constitution we put in all the orders for free
[1:26:09.180 --> 1:26:13.580]  on thought crime I commit every day, and he was upset by this?
[1:26:14.940 --> 1:26:20.860]  Well, actually, see, my husband, he's very political, and he doesn't think that kids are
[1:26:20.860 --> 1:26:25.740]  learning the Constitution in schools anymore, and so he sent them one, and basically,
[1:26:25.740 --> 1:26:32.300]  my ex-husband, you know, took it out of possession, and, you know, that shows his attitude towards it.
[1:26:34.300 --> 1:26:37.820]  But I bet he lets them watch mainstream television that totally ruins children.
[1:26:38.620 --> 1:26:44.540]  Oh, man, it's awful. My kids, see, I raise them in a basically Christian home, and I
[1:26:45.500 --> 1:26:50.380]  monitored what they watched, and, you know, he would let them watch vampire movies where they
[1:26:50.380 --> 1:26:55.980]  kill each other and mutiny and all kinds of stuff. Well, see, that's okay, though. It's only the
[1:26:55.980 --> 1:27:02.620]  Constitution. You can't have that. Right, right. No, I mean, we've got police busting indoors
[1:27:02.620 --> 1:27:07.900]  without warrants for Ron Paul signs now. I mean, it's, you know, it's just the complete lunatics.
[1:27:07.900 --> 1:27:13.340]  I mean, they're a cult, folks. The officers that buy this propaganda are out of their minds.
[1:27:14.220 --> 1:27:18.620]  Okay, well, Sarah, good to hear from you. I appreciate the call. Buddy in Ohio,
[1:27:18.620 --> 1:27:22.140]  you're on the air. Another thought criminal, I'm sure. Go ahead, sir. Please don't talk about
[1:27:22.140 --> 1:27:27.020]  the Constitution. Please, please. Yeah, I'd just like to say thanks to you and your whole staff
[1:27:27.020 --> 1:27:31.580]  for everything you've done. I've been awake for about a year now, and I appreciate everything
[1:27:31.580 --> 1:27:37.900]  you guys have done for me. And just with the whole everybody trying to doubt you and everything,
[1:27:37.900 --> 1:27:43.340]  I spent the first six months listening to you and looking up everything you said, and I have no
[1:27:43.340 --> 1:27:48.780]  doubt in anything you say anymore. Well, you should still, you should trust me, but verify.
[1:27:49.900 --> 1:27:54.540]  Yeah, I still need to continue. Oh, yeah, you need to have it for yourself. Very important.
[1:27:55.420 --> 1:28:00.540]  Oh, yeah, I still do that. I mean, I used to like the internet for a whole totally different
[1:28:00.540 --> 1:28:05.980]  reason a year ago. And I just want to say I appreciate everything you guys are doing.
[1:28:05.980 --> 1:28:11.100]  And I downloaded the Obama deception last night. I started to watch it. I fell asleep. I had it
[1:28:11.100 --> 1:28:16.860]  on repeat. And I caught like the last 20 minutes of it. And I woke up to the part where they're
[1:28:16.860 --> 1:28:23.180]  all chanting, Obama, Obama. And it like I woke up almost in tears because it just depresses me
[1:28:23.180 --> 1:28:30.220]  every time I see these people worshiping this man. And he's good. You know, he's worthless
[1:28:30.220 --> 1:28:35.740]  pretty much. He has no control. Well, there's a good endorsement of the film. It was so exciting.
[1:28:35.740 --> 1:28:43.100]  You fell asleep. Oh, no, I was up all night. No, I had to. I don't understand the morning.
[1:28:43.100 --> 1:28:46.860]  No, I understand you downloaded it at night. And I was joking. Well, listen,
[1:28:47.820 --> 1:28:53.340]  call back and give me a review once you've seen it. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Anything else, buddy?
[1:28:56.780 --> 1:29:01.580]  I just know I just like to say thanks, man. I don't want to take up too much of your time. I just
[1:29:01.580 --> 1:29:07.100]  want to spread my gratitude towards you and Jason and the whole staff that you guys do and
[1:29:07.820 --> 1:29:12.140]  you guys turned me on to a whole, whole new atmosphere. I opened up my eyes and
[1:29:13.020 --> 1:29:18.300]  I see the world as whole are totally clearly now. I learned how to read between the lines
[1:29:18.300 --> 1:29:23.820]  of what these guys are saying. You know, I used to be a flowhead baby and brainwashed and
[1:29:24.940 --> 1:29:29.900]  finally opened my eyes. And thank you. Thank you, sir. And all I would ask people who are
[1:29:29.900 --> 1:29:35.820]  impressed with the Obama deception is burn the Divx. It's very easy. You can burn the film in
[1:29:35.820 --> 1:29:42.540]  high quality to regular CDs. Now, it's nothing compared to buying the actual DVD at infowars.com.

[1:34:35.920 --> 1:34:41.720]  to go over this report saying Ron Paul supporters are terrorists. We should get angry about
[1:34:41.720 --> 1:34:46.440]  this. Now libertarians want to kill cops. Ron Paul supporters are terrorists. This is
[1:34:46.440 --> 1:34:50.760]  up on infowars.com right now. We're going to go through some of this report. But right

[1:35:08.800 --> 1:35:17.040]  the world that feed on that passion. God bless Alex Jones. Wow. I just have a quick question
[1:35:17.040 --> 1:35:23.760]  and then I'm going to comment that suggestion. Well, the suggestion first, I guess, and I
[1:35:23.760 --> 1:35:30.680]  sent a mail, I mailed something to you earlier, but you know, I want to go door to door with
[1:35:30.680 --> 1:35:36.560]  your message and talk to as many people. I want to be absolutely on the front lines talking
[1:35:36.560 --> 1:35:41.720]  about this stuff. The problem is I have a wife and five kids and uh, why don't you do
[1:35:41.720 --> 1:35:48.480]  a pilot program where you sent me lose trying to sell your stuff and uh, I think you'll
[1:35:48.480 --> 1:35:52.520]  make money and I think that the message will be spread. What do you think about that? And
[1:35:52.520 --> 1:35:57.120]  then we can put the money back into expanding it in the message. I think it's great. I mean,
[1:35:57.120 --> 1:36:03.040]  but I wouldn't wait for orders from headquarters. Um, I would, uh, I mean, we're selling the
[1:36:03.040 --> 1:36:08.720]  films in bulk for like $8 a piece. If you buy a bunch of them and Obama is really, really
[1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:14.320]  hot and so you can use his hype and his propaganda to get people to watch it. Then they find
[1:36:14.320 --> 1:36:19.000]  out it's really about the international bankers, the current banking takeover, how the world
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:23.160]  government's being set up, the secret police, the FEMA camps. We immediately come in and
[1:36:23.160 --> 1:36:29.600]  say this is not left or right. Obama's working with Bush. They're just puppets. We, we, we
[1:36:29.600 --> 1:36:34.360]  immediately shatter the left, right paradigm and we get right into issues. So it's, it
[1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:38.840]  is just absolute. It's the truth. And so it's, it's just made to wake people up.
[1:36:38.840 --> 1:36:44.000]  Well, you don't think that may be worth it? I mean, I am so passionate about this. I want
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  to do that.
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:49.440]  No, no, no, you're not listening. Listen, I have to scrounge and you know, work on it
[1:36:49.440 --> 1:36:53.920]  just to get lunch here. Uh, you know, I'm the guy at midnight going around picking up
[1:36:53.920 --> 1:36:59.360]  coffee cups here in the pig pen at the office. Uh, and I'm trying to grow. I'm trying to
[1:36:59.360 --> 1:37:04.440]  hire more people than I've got to deal with all those issues. I'm very small, sir. And
[1:37:04.440 --> 1:37:09.240]  so you're saying you want to sell my stuff door to door. Okay. I don't know. What do
[1:37:09.240 --> 1:37:12.040]  I do? I mean, how do I help you do that? What are you saying?
[1:37:12.040 --> 1:37:17.200]  Uh, well, you know, all I'm saying is that, uh, I believe that I could make a profit for
[1:37:17.200 --> 1:37:20.840]  you, but that's, that's up to you. This is sort of a business deal. We don't need to
[1:37:20.840 --> 1:37:21.840]  talk about it.
[1:37:21.840 --> 1:37:26.480]  What I'm saying is just by the videos at more than I do selling them in bulk. Well, hold
[1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:32.360]  on. I'm selling them in bulk at 60% off. And if you count the cost of the DVD and making
[1:37:32.360 --> 1:37:38.280]  it, it's more like 70% off. Okay. You know, let's say a DVD package, everything in bulk
[1:37:38.280 --> 1:37:44.200]  cost me about a dollar. Then there's the shipping it out to you. Uh, there's the, uh, cost of
[1:37:44.200 --> 1:37:48.080]  making the film. I mean, when I'm selling these at $8 a piece for folks that buy more
[1:37:48.080 --> 1:37:52.800]  than a hundred of them, when I'm selling them at that price, folks, I mean, that is just
[1:37:52.800 --> 1:37:59.600]  that is in publishing video or in books. That is as low as it gets. I just want to move
[1:37:59.600 --> 1:38:03.520]  it out the door and then you just buy them in bulk. And then there's no communication.
[1:38:03.520 --> 1:38:06.760]  There's no cause I can barely communicate with my wife or family. Now I'm working so
[1:38:06.760 --> 1:38:13.760]  much. I mean, I could try to launch a program, hire people, people do that, but the model
[1:38:13.760 --> 1:38:18.960]  of just reaching out to folks and just doing it. But listen, I appreciate all your support
[1:38:18.960 --> 1:38:24.160]  and I appreciate your excitement. And I appreciate you saying how great I am, but it's kind of
[1:38:24.160 --> 1:38:28.760]  getting out of control here on the show. Uh, I'm just doing what I do because I want to
[1:38:28.760 --> 1:38:32.680]  survive and I want to fight the tyranny. And I know that's what you want, but, uh, anything
[1:38:32.680 --> 1:38:33.680]  else, Kelly?
[1:38:33.680 --> 1:38:40.080]  Yes. I just want to say, you know, in the 18 thirties, there was a religious, uh, leader
[1:38:40.080 --> 1:38:44.600]  that said that there will come a time when the constitution of the United States will
[1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:50.080]  hang by a thread. Uh, do you know who, who said that?
[1:38:50.080 --> 1:38:54.840]  A lot of people said that. And then it did end up, uh, did end up happening with Lincoln
[1:38:54.840 --> 1:38:58.000]  just 30 something years later, but no, who said that?
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:03.480]  Well, no, well, no. Yeah. I, and the interesting part about this is this was 60 years after
[1:39:03.480 --> 1:39:09.120]  the constitution of the United States began. Uh, Joseph Smith said that the leader of
[1:39:09.120 --> 1:39:13.560]  the Mormon church, but, uh, I just think, you know, he didn't say the string would
[1:39:13.560 --> 1:39:19.480]  break. I think we are destined to win this thing. And, but anyway, it's very interesting
[1:39:19.480 --> 1:39:23.720]  that, uh, that everything he said, all these things are coming about. The constitution
[1:39:23.720 --> 1:39:28.360]  is hanging by a thread. And if it wasn't for the Alex Jones is out there, you know,
[1:39:28.360 --> 1:39:31.440]  it may pop. You're doing a great work, my friend. I'll let you go.
[1:39:31.440 --> 1:39:35.880]  All right. Thank you so much. And maybe I should develop a program. It's just with
[1:39:35.880 --> 1:39:40.900]  wholesaling, we have enough trouble just getting them out to people. It's a management issue.
[1:39:40.900 --> 1:39:48.800]  We are small folks. Uh, let's talk to a shoe who's listening, uh, from the internet. People
[1:39:48.800 --> 1:39:50.040]  kind of take advantage of that.
[1:39:50.040 --> 1:39:53.800]  Where I say, we don't even need to know where you're calling from or your name, but it'd
[1:39:53.800 --> 1:39:58.320]  be easier if you just said Bob from St. Louis, you know, uh, but no, we'll call you what
[1:39:58.320 --> 1:40:01.560]  you want to be called shoe on head internet. Go ahead.
[1:40:01.560 --> 1:40:05.480]  All right. Hey Alex, how are you doing today? Good. Go ahead.
[1:40:05.480 --> 1:40:10.560]  All right. I'm calling about, uh, Symantec really quick. It's the company that makes
[1:40:10.560 --> 1:40:15.120]  a Norton antivirus. And, um, I don't know if you picked up this story yet. I haven't
[1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:20.120]  seen it on your site, but basically they've just been caught red handed sneaking, uh,
[1:40:20.120 --> 1:40:25.640]  an update into their antivirus that without your consent, uh, we'll send your cookies
[1:40:25.640 --> 1:40:30.800]  information, uh, Google desktop information to a company that turns out to do military
[1:40:30.800 --> 1:40:36.680]  intelligence. And, um, it's on a buffed up secret. That's where I saw it first. And
[1:40:36.680 --> 1:40:41.880]  by now it's been picked up by the UK telegraph. Uh, I think I saw an article in the Washington
[1:40:41.880 --> 1:40:51.520]  post. Okay. That is huge news. Uh, send it as a tip, uh, to, uh, Rob D at info wars.com.
[1:40:51.520 --> 1:40:54.680]  What's the headline from London telegraph? I mean, we hear of this all the time. Most
[1:40:54.680 --> 1:41:01.040]  of these big companies are intelligence agency fronts. And then you'll notice that it's
[1:41:01.040 --> 1:41:06.040]  always a former intelligence chief or sub chief from one of the 30 something intelligence
[1:41:06.040 --> 1:41:11.120]  agencies in the U S alone or the 15 big ones. And then that's how the revolving door works.
[1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:16.160]  He'll get a few million a year as he sits over the private company engaging in all of
[1:41:16.160 --> 1:41:20.680]  this activity. But, uh, give me the headline out of the London guardian or the London telegraph.
[1:41:20.680 --> 1:41:26.840]  Uh, it's, uh, the telegraph. Yes. And it's called internet conspiracy theories, uh, abound
[1:41:26.840 --> 1:41:36.360]  over Symantec, uh, PIFTS.exe file. But, um, see how they do that. You're saying you,
[1:41:36.360 --> 1:41:39.760]  they've admitted their spying that it goes to military intelligence, but it's still a
[1:41:39.760 --> 1:41:44.760]  conspiracy theory to not like it. But funny thing, but funny thing is Symantec on their
[1:41:44.760 --> 1:41:50.200]  after, uh, a storm of complaints on their site shutting down their forms because there
[1:41:50.200 --> 1:41:55.880]  was so much outcry. Symantec actually admitted that they passed on the information without
[1:41:55.880 --> 1:42:00.320]  the user's consent to, and the company is called swap drive. And if you look at swap
[1:42:00.320 --> 1:42:04.600]  drive, the people behind it, they're based in Arlington VA. So I guess that's just a
[1:42:04.600 --> 1:42:10.680]  coincidence. And, um, the two guys, there's a Mark Wallace and a Roland Schumann, and
[1:42:10.680 --> 1:42:16.960]  they're both, um, ex military intelligence. Like I told you, they, they always are all
[1:42:16.960 --> 1:42:23.080]  the major companies. I mean, literally our former FBI or defense intelligence or CIA,
[1:42:23.080 --> 1:42:29.120]  all the big ones, even the sub ones, and they just get away with it and get away with it.
[1:42:29.120 --> 1:42:34.560]  The companies that upload the bin Laden videos, you know, Rumsfeld, second command, black ops,
[1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:42.440]  propaganda, and it's uploading fake videos. I mean, it's, it's such an insult to the public.
[1:42:42.440 --> 1:42:45.760]  All right. Well, I will cover that story. Thank you so much.
[1:42:45.760 --> 1:42:47.080]  All right. Bye-bye.
[1:42:47.080 --> 1:42:52.040]  Take care. I'll check that article. I just, you sound credible when somebody has a name
[1:42:52.040 --> 1:42:56.600]  like shoe on head. We have to confirm it. Did you guys pull that up about the company?
[1:42:56.600 --> 1:43:01.520]  Did you just hear him giving the headline? Well, I'm sure it'll be in the inbox in seconds.
[1:43:01.520 --> 1:43:08.640]  Let's go ahead and talk to EJ in Texas. EJ, you are on the air.
[1:43:08.640 --> 1:43:10.840]  Hey, Alex. How are you doing?
[1:43:10.840 --> 1:43:11.840]  Pretty good, sir.
[1:43:11.840 --> 1:43:16.560]  Big fan. Big fan. Congratulations. That was well done. Well done. I stayed up last night
[1:43:16.560 --> 1:43:21.320]  to watch it. Um, I had to finish it this morning, but you and your crew did a fantastic job.
[1:43:21.320 --> 1:43:25.400]  I know you're not a one-man operation, and you've got a great team, and you're doing
[1:43:25.400 --> 1:43:30.520]  wonderful work. I have an analysis, a little bit of critique as well. I think you did a
[1:43:30.520 --> 1:43:36.280]  really good job synthesizing all of the areas of control that Governor Obama's administration
[1:43:36.280 --> 1:43:40.480]  and will govern it. I think you did a really good job at the graphics. Everything just
[1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:43.920]  seamlessly came together, and I like it. I think the Bilderberg part was a little bit
[1:43:43.920 --> 1:43:48.440]  too long for my particular taste. That's just because I'm, I'm pretty familiar with
[1:43:48.440 --> 1:43:55.840]  it, but here's three areas that I think really could drive home the point of Obama's administration
[1:43:55.840 --> 1:44:00.080]  where they're headed. But I also realized that they need to be blown out into probably
[1:44:00.080 --> 1:44:01.080]  another movie idea.
[1:44:01.080 --> 1:44:06.560]  Well, I mean, give us your idea in a minute. Let me just add this before I forget. I always
[1:44:06.560 --> 1:44:12.000]  make films that are two and a half, three hours or longer. I mean, Marshall Laws over
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:18.680]  three hours, In-Games almost three hours, Terror Storms over two hours. So I made this
[1:44:18.680 --> 1:44:23.320]  112 minutes long, which is still lengthy. The average documentary is about 85 to 90
[1:44:23.320 --> 1:44:28.320]  minutes long. And obviously we, that's the problem. There's so much corruption, so much
[1:44:28.320 --> 1:44:35.000]  lies that there's no way to cover it at all. And so obviously everything's not going to
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  be in there, but go ahead.
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:39.560]  That's exactly right. And that's exactly what I was thinking as a while. They, they
[1:44:39.560 --> 1:44:43.200]  have too much information. They're just not a time to cover it. And I totally understand
[1:44:43.200 --> 1:44:48.680]  that and I appreciate it. And everybody that sees this who's not key, who's not in on,
[1:44:48.680 --> 1:44:53.800]  on, on the no, they're going to still be enlightened. So that's fine. What I'm saying is three
[1:44:53.800 --> 1:44:59.040]  areas that are important in terms of Obama himself. One is, one is the, the Rezco affiliation
[1:44:59.040 --> 1:45:03.880]  that Corsi brought up. All the ties that Rezco or Tarpley brought up that were in the film.
[1:45:03.880 --> 1:45:07.360]  And you can totally blow this up however you need to, but that needs to be uncovered as
[1:45:07.360 --> 1:45:10.800]  well because the general populace still doesn't understand his background.
[1:45:10.800 --> 1:45:15.800]  Yeah, but here's the deal. The mainstream media wanted it to be about, is he a communist?
[1:45:15.800 --> 1:45:20.480]  Ties the communist, you know, terrorist. Uh, was he really born in Kenya? The mainstream
[1:45:20.480 --> 1:45:24.840]  media, because they believe they can spin that and make it a left, right issue that
[1:45:24.840 --> 1:45:28.480]  I believe in a way that's really a honeypot. I'm not saying it's bad to report it. We have
[1:45:28.480 --> 1:45:34.120]  covered it. It's, I mean, obvious. Look, look, look, I, the one area of the film with that,
[1:45:34.120 --> 1:45:38.000]  that we didn't have time to do because of constraints and having to get it out quickly
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  is how many people have had to resign or step down and all the corruption and bid rigging
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:49.720]  and, and, and, and payoffs and money and just how it's all a pack of crooks. I mean, there
[1:45:49.720 --> 1:45:57.280]  was just FBI raids today on the offices of one of Obama's appointees. So yes, I mean,
[1:45:57.280 --> 1:46:02.680]  it's just amazingly mafia-esque, but that's gotten so much coverage. We were covering
[1:46:02.680 --> 1:46:09.640]  just his lies, his betrayal, the banker takeover, the FEMA camps, the troops. Uh, you know,
[1:46:09.640 --> 1:46:12.680]  that's what we were doing in this film.
[1:46:12.680 --> 1:46:16.520]  The corruption with the Chicago scene only. Um, and, and then the other two points that
[1:46:16.520 --> 1:46:20.960]  I think that really need to be, uh, talk about and discuss into a new movie idea for you
[1:46:20.960 --> 1:46:25.240]  guys. And I know you can do it, but what really needs to be done soon is, is, is, is the,
[1:46:25.240 --> 1:46:30.000]  like an end game to when, where you guys can cover, uh, the vaccinations, the GM crops,
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:33.200]  what the allergies, what's really behind the allergy. Well, I said we're going to do that.
[1:46:33.200 --> 1:46:37.480]  That's actually my next film and re, you know, getting rid of the bow on there. And I know
[1:46:37.480 --> 1:46:41.160]  you guys are, are, are already on the table. I'm sure, but we need to talk about these
[1:46:41.160 --> 1:46:45.280]  things. We need people to understand that when they, when they attack you physically,
[1:46:45.280 --> 1:46:48.560]  they're attacking you mentally and that has all kinds of ramifications. Yes. We're being
[1:46:48.560 --> 1:46:52.440]  attacked through the water, attacked through the air, attacked with the GMO foods and the
[1:46:52.440 --> 1:46:57.000]  globalist brag publicly they're doing it. This is incredible crime. The public knew
[1:46:57.000 --> 1:47:01.260]  they would be so much more outrage, but they're poisoned. So a lot of them can't mentally
[1:47:01.260 --> 1:47:05.480]  deal with it. And I listen, I've announced many times I'm going to make something along
[1:47:05.480 --> 1:47:09.480]  the lines of an end game too. It probably won't be called that that we'll just focus
[1:47:09.480 --> 1:47:13.400]  on how they're killing us and how they're engaging in soft kill operations. So that
[1:47:13.400 --> 1:47:17.840]  has been announced. That is one of the next projects I'm doing. I might finish the JFK
[1:47:17.840 --> 1:47:21.760]  thing real quick or I may keep shelving it. It's important, but not as important as what's
[1:47:21.760 --> 1:47:25.740]  all happening right now. It gets into the shadow government as the reason I could rationalize
[1:47:25.740 --> 1:47:31.040]  making a JFK film to kind of show folks how there was the coup d'etat back in 63, but
[1:47:31.040 --> 1:47:37.240]  the Obama deception covers that. I appreciate your call, sir. And thank you for the critique.
[1:47:37.240 --> 1:47:41.200]  And look, we rushed this film out and you always sit there and watch it over and over
[1:47:41.200 --> 1:47:45.280]  again, you know, in the week before you release it and then you find mistakes after, but they're
[1:47:45.280 --> 1:47:50.120]  always a little petty things like I told the graphics guy, it's Richard in Haas, head
[1:47:50.120 --> 1:47:54.280]  of the council on foreign relations. The film says Richard in Haas. It doesn't matter. There's
[1:47:54.280 --> 1:47:58.240]  this picture. Here he is. He's in the news. You know who it is. Richard in Haas, you
[1:47:58.240 --> 1:48:04.480]  know, nitpicky, uh, little stuff like that. Uh, but I'm glad people point that out. Now,
[1:48:04.480 --> 1:48:10.160]  now I'll tell you this. We have probably three hours of more tarpily interview an hour and
[1:48:10.160 --> 1:48:15.200]  a half of solente interview. We have hours and hours of interviews never been seen with
[1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:22.600]  Ventura. We have hours and hours of George Humphrey interview. We have more KRS one that
[1:48:22.600 --> 1:48:27.520]  hasn't been seen for all of it. And so I will tell you the guys were asking what's next.
[1:48:27.520 --> 1:48:32.520]  And I said, I don't want to have a big stressful killer project for you guys as I write up,
[1:48:32.520 --> 1:48:38.040]  you know, the direction of the next film. I said, uh, I want you in the next week. I
[1:48:38.040 --> 1:48:47.560]  want you guys take a few days off. But I said next week, I want to condense kind of the
[1:48:47.560 --> 1:48:52.080]  Obama deception 1.5, just like we did with in game. And I think it's going to be like
[1:48:52.080 --> 1:49:01.640]  two hours long folks, an in a Obama deception 1.5. And we are going to get into not the
[1:49:01.640 --> 1:49:07.840]  Kenya stuff because it's a honey pot, but we are going to get into the resco and the
[1:49:07.840 --> 1:49:12.320]  mafianess and, and, and, and the corruption and a bunch of other stuff we didn't have
[1:49:12.320 --> 1:49:16.080]  time to put in the film. So there is going to be, in fact, I'll just, I've made the decision
[1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:19.040]  right now. I'd already made the decision, but I hadn't really told the guys yet. I was
[1:49:19.040 --> 1:49:21.920]  like, I'll tell you next week what we're doing. We're going to put out some, some of the extras
[1:49:21.920 --> 1:49:26.440]  of the film that there's the official extras that we're going to post tomorrow at prison
[1:49:26.440 --> 1:49:31.800]  planet.TV for members. This is about 30 minutes of those, but sometime in the next few weeks,
[1:49:31.800 --> 1:49:41.040]  there will be an Obama deception 1.5 at prison planet.TV. And it'll probably be an hour and
[1:49:41.040 --> 1:49:47.560]  a half, two hours long and it's mainly going to be interviews. So you want it. You got
[1:49:47.560 --> 1:49:52.720]  it already on the same page, brother. All right. And I'll do a sit down and introduce
[1:49:52.720 --> 1:49:57.560]  it and explain this is a little stuff we didn't have time to put in the film, both with time
[1:49:57.560 --> 1:50:02.040]  restraints and with length. I mean, it's not effective to put out more than a two hour
[1:50:02.040 --> 1:50:06.160]  film. I mean, you know, some other films are really three films in one. Here it is. Internet
[1:50:06.160 --> 1:50:13.520]  conspiracy theories abound over company and it says internet message boards are a wash
[1:50:13.520 --> 1:50:19.280]  with rumors. This evening of the mysterious new file found in the most recent Norton Internet
[1:50:19.280 --> 1:50:28.880]  protection security update from Symantec. And then it goes on to admit that ties into
[1:50:28.880 --> 1:50:31.840]  army intelligence and all of it. I have to read it during the break, but it's just par
[1:50:31.840 --> 1:50:41.440]  for the course. The file called PIFTS.exe request permission to dial out of the internet,
[1:50:41.440 --> 1:50:46.200]  but users of Symantec's Norton Internet protection software have found it an almost impossible
[1:50:46.200 --> 1:50:50.320]  to find more information about the files origin and purpose. And the situation has led to
[1:50:50.320 --> 1:50:55.920]  a rash of rumors on the online message boards about the true purpose of the file. But we're
[1:50:55.920 --> 1:51:03.640]  confirming that the company admits it's going to intelligence. If you experience sudden
[1:51:03.640 --> 1:51:08.640]  bouts of joint discomfort, swelling and redness, especially in your ankle or toe, you are not

[1:52:04.920 --> 1:52:10.240]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind
[1:52:10.240 --> 1:52:15.680]  of world order that I think all of us would like to see. The Obama deception completely
[1:52:15.680 --> 1:52:20.320]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[1:52:20.320 --> 1:52:24.960]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election. If you have
[1:52:24.960 --> 1:52:29.920]  a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the
[1:52:29.920 --> 1:52:37.880]  program of a group of extreme bankers and finance older bucks, that's fascism.
[1:52:37.880 --> 1:52:42.600]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents
[1:52:42.600 --> 1:52:49.600]  who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama

[1:52:56.560 --> 1:53:01.760]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[1:53:01.760 --> 1:53:05.720]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political
[1:53:05.720 --> 1:53:09.840]  problems facing the U.S. and the world. And for the first time in their lives, they are
[1:53:09.840 --> 1:53:15.240]  feeling the need for preparedness. Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation manufacturing

[1:54:00.720 --> 1:54:16.120]  All right. I want to get into secret death squads of Dick Cheney. Now mainstream news.
[1:54:16.120 --> 1:54:21.600]  I want to get into... I think we should make a bigger deal out of this. I'm just so conditioned
[1:54:21.600 --> 1:54:28.960]  that they engage in these activities. I should have been covering this the whole show. This
[1:54:28.960 --> 1:54:33.400]  state police document, and I've got it out of California and other places where the feds
[1:54:33.400 --> 1:54:38.760]  are saying that Ron Paul supporters are basically terrorists that want to kill cops. The North
[1:54:38.760 --> 1:54:47.160]  American Union doesn't exist. Everything else is so disgusting. Yes, the Obama deception
[1:54:47.160 --> 1:54:53.880]  has dropped. It is out at prisonplanet.tv. Or you can call toll-free and order the DVD

[1:55:09.760 --> 1:55:14.480]  ahead here and go to Jessica in Vermont. Jessica, you're on the air.
[1:55:14.480 --> 1:55:24.000]  Hi. So I talked to Captain Hall today also down in Missouri about this document.
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:28.200]  Exactly. Recap. So people are saying this document, saying Ron Paul supporters are terrorists,
[1:55:28.200 --> 1:55:31.600]  doesn't exist, and Bob Barrett supporters and libertarians are terrorists and want to
[1:55:31.600 --> 1:55:35.720]  kill cops. And then you can call the state police and they admit it. But go ahead.
[1:55:35.720 --> 1:55:42.560]  Yes, exactly. I had seen the document online and it freaked me out because it was saying
[1:55:42.560 --> 1:55:47.480]  that campaign for liberty, Ron Paul, all these different groups were militia, basically militia
[1:55:47.480 --> 1:55:52.680]  sympathizers, or that they were people involved. But it's not that militias are even bad. They
[1:55:52.680 --> 1:55:57.120]  say militias want to kill cops. So first they demonize militias, then they tie it to white
[1:55:57.120 --> 1:55:59.720]  supremacists, then they tie it to Ron Paul. Go ahead.
[1:55:59.720 --> 1:56:06.480]  Right. Well, I just kind of wanted to reiterate. I called the number on the document and I
[1:56:06.480 --> 1:56:12.200]  was directed to the public information department and I was told to talk to Captain Tim Hall.
[1:56:12.200 --> 1:56:14.240]  So then after I hung up with...
[1:56:14.240 --> 1:56:16.720]  Oh, it's Tim Hall. He wouldn't tell us his...
[1:56:16.720 --> 1:56:22.720]  Tim. Yeah, no. His name is Tim Hall. And when I got off the phone with the woman on the
[1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:27.280]  first line, I kind of was like, I don't know if I want to call. This is kind of weird.
[1:56:27.280 --> 1:56:33.080]  But then I decided, you know what? This is Ron, so I'm calling. So I did. And Captain
[1:56:33.080 --> 1:56:40.840]  Hall and I spoke for quite a while. And hang on a second, hon. Okay. So basically, let me
[1:56:40.840 --> 1:56:44.760]  just run through what he said, because I did take some notes and I wrote some stuff down.
[1:56:44.760 --> 1:56:51.560]  He said the information is correct and they were putting it out. I'm sorry to educate
[1:56:51.560 --> 1:56:53.360]  law enforcement officers about...
[1:56:53.360 --> 1:56:57.960]  That's okay. I have children. You're not giving her attention, so she's mad. Why don't you
[1:56:57.960 --> 1:57:00.920]  just tell her? Why don't you just tell her mommy's coming in a minute and come back?
[1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:01.920]  Go ahead.
[1:57:01.920 --> 1:57:02.920]  I'll be right there, buddy.
[1:57:02.920 --> 1:57:03.920]  It's a boy. Okay.
[1:57:03.920 --> 1:57:09.240]  Come here. Yeah, yeah. No, he's a boy. Let me... You'll be right here with mommy. I'm going
[1:57:09.240 --> 1:57:14.840]  to put you down. Okay. So he said that it's a strategic alert to address trends in officer
[1:57:14.840 --> 1:57:19.720]  safety issues. He went on to say that there have been incidents in the past where militia
[1:57:19.720 --> 1:57:25.000]  groups target law enforcement officers in one case in Missouri killing an officer and
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:27.440]  that they need to be aware of all potential threats.
[1:57:27.440 --> 1:57:31.720]  Yeah. I have to say that Ron Paul's a terrorist and the new owner doesn't exist because cops
[1:57:31.720 --> 1:57:36.440]  will be killed. See, it's always... It's for our safety has nothing to do with that. This
[1:57:36.440 --> 1:57:41.320]  is secret political demonization of the American people that are fighting for the Republic.
[1:57:41.320 --> 1:57:49.560]  Well, then what I said was, it's interesting because Congress has to take an oath to the
[1:57:49.560 --> 1:57:55.560]  Constitution. People that join the armed forces have to take an oath to the Constitution.
[1:57:55.560 --> 1:58:01.280]  The president, are these people potentially involved with violent militias? The supporting
[1:58:01.280 --> 1:58:07.440]  these people then make you supportive of violent militias? And he was, oh, no, no, of course
[1:58:07.440 --> 1:58:13.320]  not. You know, that's not what we're getting at. So then I asked him if this wasn't profiling
[1:58:13.320 --> 1:58:17.480]  because you're singling out people that might have Ron Paul bumper stickers on their cars
[1:58:17.480 --> 1:58:24.240]  and he said again and again and again, this is not profiling. So then I asked him if an
[1:58:24.240 --> 1:58:29.840]  officer was to see a Ron Paul bumper sticker on a car and this person was pulled over.
[1:58:29.840 --> 1:58:34.080]  And after seeing this document, you're going to tell me that the police officer is not
[1:58:34.080 --> 1:58:37.600]  going to have... Stay there, stay there. Back in 70 seconds
[1:58:37.600 --> 1:58:45.840]  with the third hour. I want to hear what he said. Thank you for listening to GCN. Be

[2:00:06.880 --> 2:00:14.280]  mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[2:00:14.280 --> 2:00:23.080]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. All over
[2:00:23.080 --> 2:00:28.200]  the United States, Canada, England, Europe, they set up threat integration centers, fusion
[2:00:28.200 --> 2:00:32.560]  centers. The feds take over, the army moves in, they brainwash the state police, local
[2:00:32.560 --> 2:00:37.720]  police. We got the training videos. The founding fathers are bad, gun owners are bad, gun owners
[2:00:37.720 --> 2:00:42.280]  may want to kill you. Those that talk about the Constitution want to kill you. Go read
[2:00:42.280 --> 2:00:47.000]  it for yourself, all eight pages, up on the info wars.com and prisonplanet.com. We have
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:50.960]  it scanned in and it says, they're everywhere. They want to kill you. They're white supremacists.
[2:00:50.960 --> 2:00:55.960]  And then it goes, by the way, here's who they're with. This is who they may be. Ron Paul, all
[2:00:55.960 --> 2:01:01.640]  libertarians, all Ron Paul supporters, Constitution party supporters, people that watch America
[2:01:01.640 --> 2:01:05.320]  Freedom to Fascism, you know, they're with the Turner Diaries. They want to blow up the
[2:01:05.320 --> 2:01:11.240]  OKC building. This is meant to create a chilling effect and demonize anybody who's anti-New
[2:01:11.240 --> 2:01:16.360]  World Order. Anybody who's an American saying, I don't want to be colonized by private offshore
[2:01:16.360 --> 2:01:24.960]  banks. So you're talking to State Trooper Hull, Captain Hull, up there and we've talked
[2:01:24.960 --> 2:01:29.080]  to him as well. And what you said is exactly what he said to us, but then he cut it short.
[2:01:29.080 --> 2:01:32.920]  But you were asking the good questions. So you bring up to him, well, wait a minute.
[2:01:32.920 --> 2:01:35.920]  I mean, you're saying go after Ron Paul, people watch out. They want to kill you. That's what
[2:01:35.920 --> 2:01:39.920]  every page says. It's like, they want to kill you. Next, we'll tell you about Ron Paul.
[2:01:39.920 --> 2:01:43.600]  And then to make it sound legitimate for officer safety and then the white supremacist and then
[2:01:43.600 --> 2:01:49.560]  Ron Paul and then America Freedom to Fascism. So it's clear psych warfare. What did he say
[2:01:49.560 --> 2:01:54.560]  when you pointed out, there's no way somebody reads this and then doesn't, you know, persecute
[2:01:54.560 --> 2:01:57.080]  Ron Paul supporters and others. What did he say?
[2:01:57.080 --> 2:02:02.000]  He basically kept denying it and kept saying that it was for educational purposes only.
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:06.320]  And I, and I just, I couldn't, I went back and forth with him about the whole profiling
[2:02:06.320 --> 2:02:11.720]  issue a few times. I made another example, you know, of another situation where somebody
[2:02:11.720 --> 2:02:17.040]  might have a sticker on their car and, you know, if somebody's driving down the road
[2:02:17.040 --> 2:02:21.280]  and they have a Grateful Dead bumper sticker on their car, you know, well, if that person
[2:02:21.280 --> 2:02:26.160]  gets pulled over, probably there's going to be in that police man's mind. There might
[2:02:26.160 --> 2:02:29.400]  be drugs in this car. You know, it's just something you put together.
[2:02:29.400 --> 2:02:34.600]  Look, it's common sense, but it's something that you think about. So for them to then
[2:02:34.600 --> 2:02:40.960]  put, connect Ron Paul campaign for liberty, constitution party, libertarian party, even
[2:02:40.960 --> 2:02:50.120]  anti-abortion with a militia movement, a violent militia movement is definitely profiling.
[2:02:50.120 --> 2:02:56.760]  It's setting up their officers to profile drivers on the road. I mean, it's like, yeah,
[2:02:56.760 --> 2:03:00.640]  how he can deny it over and over again and say, no, it's just for educational purposes.
[2:03:00.640 --> 2:03:04.880]  We need to be aware of threats. We have to consider this, that and the other thing. But
[2:03:04.880 --> 2:03:09.320]  the thing that concerns me is that the campaign for liberty is having a big convention in
[2:03:09.320 --> 2:03:15.080]  Missouri on the 27th. So don't you wonder why the police flip out on people that have
[2:03:15.080 --> 2:03:19.640]  pocket constitutions? Listen, you've done a great job, but let me just add some points
[2:03:19.640 --> 2:03:25.240]  here that are important and then anything else you want to add. Remember, Missouri was
[2:03:25.240 --> 2:03:30.240]  the group with the state police and others on the news saying, if you talk about Obama,
[2:03:30.240 --> 2:03:35.760]  he'll decide if it's a lie, we're going to arrest you. And that was on the news. They
[2:03:35.760 --> 2:03:40.560]  think they're secret police because for decades they've been quietly brainwashing them that
[2:03:40.560 --> 2:03:44.720]  any popular pro America, we're the people we're supposed to run the country that we're
[2:03:44.720 --> 2:03:49.600]  and so it's so cops are scared to death of anybody that talks about freedom or second
[2:03:49.600 --> 2:03:53.480]  amendment. And there's gun control. They say they need more gun control. They talk about
[2:03:53.480 --> 2:03:57.920]  they want to kill police. We've got to have all the bullets registered in the stamp, which
[2:03:57.920 --> 2:04:02.160]  will shut down most of the gun dealers make old ammo illegal. I mean, it's selling cops
[2:04:02.160 --> 2:04:06.960]  on gun control. It's saying banning people's guns, restricting guns keeps you safe officers
[2:04:06.960 --> 2:04:11.640]  hating Ron Paul supporters and libertarians. They want to kill you. I mean, it's, it's
[2:04:11.640 --> 2:04:16.960]  what it is is brainwashing of the police. You know, one of the, one of the points that
[2:04:16.960 --> 2:04:21.160]  I want to make while I'm on the, while I've got you and I'm on the air here is that, you
[2:04:21.160 --> 2:04:31.880]  know, for, for this group to come out with this very targeted message against Ron Paul,
[2:04:31.880 --> 2:04:41.280]  Ron Paul is a tenured respected. He's a Republican. He's on, you know, he's been on Fox News
[2:04:41.280 --> 2:04:46.440]  more times in the last couple of weeks than I can count. You know, he, he is, he, he's
[2:04:46.440 --> 2:04:50.720]  not, he's not just some goofball off. Look, they know that they know that they're the
[2:04:50.720 --> 2:04:55.400]  people overthrowing America. They're the ones engaged in crimes. The globalists, so they
[2:04:55.400 --> 2:05:00.000]  got to brainwash the police. Good to hear from you. Great point. Stay with us this morning.
[2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:01.560]  Straight ahead.
[2:05:01.560 --> 2:05:05.600]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high
[2:05:05.600 --> 2:05:10.480]  energy and vibrant health? Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH
[2:05:10.480 --> 2:05:16.680]  level of nine or higher. Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals
[2:05:16.680 --> 2:05:22.080]  and elements. This product is a one of a kind in its strength and effectiveness. Using plasma
[2:05:22.080 --> 2:05:27.320]  pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of
[2:05:27.320 --> 2:05:32.600]  acid and regaining your health and energy. With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level
[2:05:32.600 --> 2:05:38.080]  of the water you drink up to the pH of 10. Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself
[2:05:38.080 --> 2:05:43.560]  of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body. Disease organisms like bacteria
[2:05:43.560 --> 2:05:49.320]  and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment. Order your bottle of alcovision plasma pH

[2:06:01.920 --> 2:06:08.040]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've
[2:06:08.040 --> 2:06:12.760]  got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[2:06:12.760 --> 2:06:18.240]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[2:06:18.240 --> 2:06:22.800]  the best interest of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged
[2:06:22.800 --> 2:06:27.520]  since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[2:06:27.520 --> 2:06:33.480]  of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and
[2:06:33.480 --> 2:06:40.480]  finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world
[2:06:40.480 --> 2:06:47.080]  government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real
[2:06:47.080 --> 2:06:53.960]  agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super

[2:07:01.600 --> 2:07:06.680]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic. This very special mineral has been used for
[2:07:06.680 --> 2:07:11.400]  centuries by most cultures throughout the world. Utopia, Texas is home to a small but
[2:07:11.400 --> 2:07:16.200]  mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver who offers colloidal products produced in
[2:07:16.200 --> 2:07:21.200]  distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates or saline solutions. Because our
[2:07:21.200 --> 2:07:25.680]  colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the
[2:07:25.680 --> 2:07:31.800]  cellular level and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[2:07:31.800 --> 2:07:35.720]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements including colloidal silver, gold
[2:07:35.720 --> 2:07:39.960]  and copper, with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce. For four
[2:07:39.960 --> 2:07:44.080]  years Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would

[2:08:02.200 --> 2:08:14.360]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:14.360 --> 2:08:29.400]  We're gonna go live at prisonplanet.tv in about 12 minutes from now and I'm so glad police
[2:08:29.400 --> 2:08:34.080]  and military are sending us more and more of this brainwashing remain given. One state
[2:08:34.080 --> 2:08:39.040]  police officer that sent me this from California said, hello guys, thought you might want to
[2:08:39.040 --> 2:08:44.520]  take a look at this piece of garbage floating around police departments. Check out the next
[2:08:44.520 --> 2:08:50.960]  to the last page. I guess I'm part of a militia movement since I support Ron Paul, John. Well,
[2:08:50.960 --> 2:08:56.320]  I've been out saying more. Anyways, the point, I almost read the thing there. PS, please buy
[2:08:56.320 --> 2:09:05.320]  Alex Cup of Coffee for me and he gave me $22. Now, this is a complete and total insult
[2:09:05.320 --> 2:09:11.040]  to anyone's intelligence. And when I get up here and I say that we have FEMA on video,
[2:09:11.040 --> 2:09:16.360]  we do in Kansas City of all places. I went back to Missouri, but it's all over the country
[2:09:16.360 --> 2:09:20.440]  saying the founding fathers were terrorists and were bad. Any American people are bad
[2:09:20.440 --> 2:09:25.200]  and the bill of rights is bad and they want to kill cops. It's based psychology. It makes
[2:09:25.200 --> 2:09:29.480]  no sense when you watch the video. I have like 18 hours of it. It's all and they believe
[2:09:29.480 --> 2:09:34.880]  that a new world order global bank wants to take over and they want to kill officers.
[2:09:34.880 --> 2:09:37.320]  So an officer, when they hear about a new world order global bank, well, that means
[2:09:37.320 --> 2:09:41.400]  kill officers for your safety. You need to know these are terrorists like the founding
[2:09:41.400 --> 2:09:47.200]  fathers. Now they are founding fathers. Terrorist and you can go read it, but we have the video.
[2:09:47.200 --> 2:09:52.120]  Then we have the squad cars out from their own squad car video finding a pot of constitution
[2:09:52.120 --> 2:09:57.080]  and going, oh, what are we going to do? I found the paraphernalia. That's what they
[2:09:57.080 --> 2:10:03.760]  call it in here, paraphernalia. I mean, they flip out folks when they see a pocket constitution.
[2:10:03.760 --> 2:10:07.000]  You know, I put these free in every order. They cost us like 65 cents a piece of a bomb
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:11.280]  in bulk. We throw them in every order. That's not inexpensive over the year with thousands
[2:10:11.280 --> 2:10:18.200]  of orders. We throw them in there and it's just the Bill of Rights Declaration of Independence
[2:10:18.200 --> 2:10:21.760]  Constitution and this is the one Abbey Newman had, the one I'm holding my hand when we put
[2:10:21.760 --> 2:10:27.520]  out is one of the oldest and best put out from Arizona been out for decades. And let
[2:10:27.520 --> 2:10:31.200]  me tell you, you show this to one of these brainwash cops that it's like a vampire that
[2:10:31.200 --> 2:10:38.560]  sees a big cross or a bucket of holy water. It's like, oh, don't kill me. You know, going
[2:10:38.560 --> 2:10:44.960]  for the gun. And it's so ridiculous because they swore an oath to protect and defend this.
[2:10:44.960 --> 2:10:48.640]  This is why we have a successful country. It's why we have a free market. It's why we have
[2:10:48.640 --> 2:10:54.520]  all these rights. These were purchased with blood by your ancestors. Ding dong. I mean,
[2:10:54.520 --> 2:11:01.320]  they really are ding dongs. And by ding dong, they're not even that bad of people. You know,
[2:11:01.320 --> 2:11:08.000]  a ding dong is just kind of a dummy. I mean, do you like being shoveled this type of bull?
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:14.400]  I'm going to get into it more later. We spent about an hour on and take calls on the big
[2:11:14.400 --> 2:11:21.280]  flu situation with them trying to mix live bird flu that kills over 60% of people that
[2:11:21.280 --> 2:11:28.160]  are in contact with it with vaccines. Dr. Rebecca Carly coming up and I want to continue with
[2:11:28.160 --> 2:11:32.840]  your phone calls. Cliff, Simon, Justin, Joe, Susie, that'll probably be it for calls though.
[2:11:32.840 --> 2:11:37.000]  This hour, we've got a guest coming up after I get to those and I've got the Psyhurst audio
[2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:41.800]  clip for everybody and the Dick Cheney news. I want to cover Cheney says SS style political
[2:11:41.800 --> 2:11:47.800]  assassination unit. And last week they released the White House memos. We'll set up a dictatorship
[2:11:47.800 --> 2:11:53.000]  and ban free speech. The president has unlimited power and can do that. People are like, oh,
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:59.160]  thank goodness Obama's here. They're continuing the takeover. It's seamless transition because
[2:11:59.160 --> 2:12:02.680]  the president is a front man for the military industrial complex and the offshore banks.
[2:12:02.680 --> 2:12:05.880]  But I'm just going to spend about five minutes with him as he's a busy guy. I hadn't had
[2:12:05.880 --> 2:12:10.760]  him on in about a week. Gold has exploded back up in prices. If you look at a week graph,
[2:12:10.760 --> 2:12:15.040]  a month graph, a year graph, it's only going straight up and Ted, when it dips buys it
[2:12:15.040 --> 2:12:19.720]  low cause for some reason people aren't smart and don't buy when it's low. And then so you
[2:12:19.720 --> 2:12:25.040]  can buy it when it's high, but pay for what it was when it was low. The best of both worlds
[2:12:25.040 --> 2:12:31.520]  with this year have your cake and eat it too repeatedly. So because Ted's smart guy and
[2:12:31.520 --> 2:12:36.280]  he's bold too. He made a big move and gold dropped a lot and it's gone way up in the
[2:12:36.280 --> 2:12:41.680]  last two days. And you can get the price it was last week right now. And I wanted to
[2:12:41.680 --> 2:12:47.040]  bring 10 Anderson up. I mean, Ted, with the FDIC saying they're bankrupt and may not be
[2:12:47.040 --> 2:12:50.840]  able to bail out any more banks and eat hundreds of billions more, I think I said 500 billion
[2:12:50.840 --> 2:12:57.240]  now, with all the things that are happening and the printing presses and high gear and
[2:12:57.240 --> 2:13:01.960]  record, you know, housing price drops and eight million, you know, houses upside down
[2:13:01.960 --> 2:13:05.680]  and growing. I mean, I don't have to go over the economic numbers. Folks, you know it.
[2:13:05.680 --> 2:13:11.640]  All I know is you are insane not to get firearms, storeable food, water filters, gold, silver
[2:13:11.640 --> 2:13:18.960]  and gut up and be willing to defend yourself. And you're insane to not take advantage of
[2:13:18.960 --> 2:13:25.320]  the deals. Ted Anderson offers here. Ted, since you were on the week or so ago, a lot
[2:13:25.320 --> 2:13:27.000]  has happened, hasn't it?
[2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:33.800]  It sure has. We watched gold. It went down to a hit right around 890 actually dip below
[2:13:33.800 --> 2:13:39.120]  that just a little bit during the day trading. But I was I'm sitting around just trying to
[2:13:39.120 --> 2:13:43.960]  buy as much as I can because I know what's going on out there. I mean, Geithner is on
[2:13:43.960 --> 2:13:49.360]  political today talking about the European Union leaders don't want to take the United
[2:13:49.360 --> 2:13:51.760]  States. We're pushing them right now.
[2:13:51.760 --> 2:13:55.360]  Oh, yeah. Mainstream news everywhere. You can Google it is saying we're probably going
[2:13:55.360 --> 2:14:00.320]  to default and lose our AAA writing and people are just going to stop overnight, stop buying
[2:14:00.320 --> 2:14:04.720]  it. And then it's over folks. I mean, you're talking not some slide into depression. I
[2:14:04.720 --> 2:14:11.240]  mean, we could easily it's like some 75 year old guy who's had four big heart attacks and
[2:14:11.240 --> 2:14:14.600]  he could have another big one at any time. He may live five more years. He may live two
[2:14:14.600 --> 2:14:20.560]  more days. But you know, the point is the ticker is going out and gold is the parachute.
[2:14:20.560 --> 2:14:21.760]  I'm sorry, Ted. Go ahead.
[2:14:21.760 --> 2:14:26.560]  Well, that you're just making a great point. If we lose Europe and China from buying our
[2:14:26.560 --> 2:14:32.520]  U.S. government security is the United States has done more toast and overnight overnight
[2:14:32.520 --> 2:14:37.080]  like on fire, burn to the ground. Boom.
[2:14:37.080 --> 2:14:41.240]  You know, it's like this. I mean, we've been deficit spending. We got way too much debt.
[2:14:41.240 --> 2:14:45.240]  If foreigners aren't willing to lend us their earned money, the United States dollar is
[2:14:45.240 --> 2:14:49.640]  going to just go right through the floor because the Federal Reserve is going to be the only
[2:14:49.640 --> 2:14:53.960]  lender of last resort and all the big banks are going to default and it'll be one super
[2:14:53.960 --> 2:14:57.240]  global bank that owns everything. They designed it all, Ted.
[2:14:57.240 --> 2:15:01.000]  That's exactly right, Alex. And that's what's going on. So when I see something like, you
[2:15:01.000 --> 2:15:05.960]  know, gold dipping below $900 an ounce here recently, that to me is just a signal for
[2:15:05.960 --> 2:15:10.880]  me to buy. It gives me that opportunity to have the edge on the market. I mean, right
[2:15:10.880 --> 2:15:18.600]  now I've got the Frank currently at 218 that coin was $240 here. Just what two weeks ago.
[2:15:18.600 --> 2:15:24.680]  And then the British sovereign is at 272. That one was just breaking $300 an ounce here
[2:15:24.680 --> 2:15:29.600]  just a couple of weeks ago as well. You know, I just, you know, I can't say it enough.
[2:15:29.600 --> 2:15:34.360]  I mean, there is way too much trouble out there in the economy to ignore what's going on.
[2:15:34.360 --> 2:15:39.440]  If you have IRAs sitting in cash or you're sitting in the banking system or if you're
[2:15:39.440 --> 2:15:45.080]  in the stock market, I mean, you really definitely have to look seriously at those investments
[2:15:45.080 --> 2:15:50.640]  because we lose Europe and we lose Asia. We are done. The United States can't sell the
[2:15:50.640 --> 2:15:55.040]  treasuries there. The dollar is going to fall like a stone. We're sliding into one of the
[2:15:55.040 --> 2:16:00.160]  deepest depressions we've ever seen and it's way worse than what we had in the 1930s.
[2:16:00.160 --> 2:16:07.080]  Let's explain that. Let's explain that long, deep depression in the real economy for five
[2:16:07.080 --> 2:16:14.240]  to 10 years. That's on the good side versus Argentina. Total meltdown. You know, in weeks,
[2:16:14.240 --> 2:16:17.960]  countries would just completely fold into war in the streets and the Pentagon admits
[2:16:17.960 --> 2:16:21.120]  that. Of course, they're banker bosses, engineered at all. Trips don't know that. You better
[2:16:21.120 --> 2:16:24.880]  find that out, pals. If you care about yourself, just how do you love the truth and being free
[2:16:24.880 --> 2:16:28.760]  or being a slave? Oh, I love being a slave. I'll go with the new world order. I'll believe
[2:16:28.760 --> 2:16:33.840]  the baloney they give me saying Ron Paul. People are terrorists. I mean, come on, folks.
[2:16:33.840 --> 2:16:39.160]  We talk, you know, in this document demonizing Ron Paul and libertarians and gun owners,
[2:16:39.160 --> 2:16:43.640]  I mean, saying that we want to kill cops, you know, in here, they go on to say that
[2:16:43.640 --> 2:16:47.800]  we believe there's a plan for world banks to take over. I mean, how do cops not read
[2:16:47.800 --> 2:16:52.400]  this and know that, you know, these crazies for decades have said this was going to happen.
[2:16:52.400 --> 2:16:55.480]  And now because we are building FEMA camps, and now because they are putting North come
[2:16:55.480 --> 2:16:59.640]  on the streets, it really is freaking them out. It actually says that, you know, that
[2:16:59.640 --> 2:17:04.840]  they admit we're right about everything, but that just makes us that much more crazy, Ted.
[2:17:04.840 --> 2:17:09.440]  It does. And you know, the Warren Buffett stepped in when the Wall Street was being
[2:17:09.440 --> 2:17:14.120]  bailed out there when Bush was still in office. And he's currently getting killed right now.
[2:17:14.120 --> 2:17:18.920]  Berkshire Hathaway is getting killed by the derivatives market. And you know, there's
[2:17:18.920 --> 2:17:23.400]  just, that's just one of the signs that are going on out there. GE just got knocked down
[2:17:23.400 --> 2:17:28.240]  from its perfect credit rating. It's never had this before. It was downgraded from a
[2:17:28.240 --> 2:17:33.480]  triple A rating to a double A rating now. I mean, these are like major institutions
[2:17:33.480 --> 2:17:39.560]  that are just crumbling in front of us. They may completely implode, Ford's in trouble,
[2:17:39.560 --> 2:17:43.400]  but don't worry. Walmart's making good profits right now.
[2:17:43.400 --> 2:17:48.880]  Well, anyways, I mean, Alice, I just need to say take advantage of these prices because
[2:17:48.880 --> 2:17:54.800]  we've had another opportunity to get into gold in that $800 range and gold right now
[2:17:54.800 --> 2:18:01.800]  has seen a high of 931 trade now trading about 924 and it's strong as ever. It's not going
[2:18:01.800 --> 2:18:07.280]  away. And if you hadn't had the chance to position your portfolio into something real,
[2:18:07.280 --> 2:18:12.520]  something hard, something that's been good for holding on to wealth for over 6,000 years
[2:18:12.520 --> 2:18:14.680]  where there's fiat currency that we have.
[2:18:14.680 --> 2:18:20.840]  Oh, by the way, in this document, it says it's terrorism to own gold, Ted. Have you
[2:18:20.840 --> 2:18:25.320]  read this on info wars.com? I didn't see that before. It says terrorists that want to kill
[2:18:25.320 --> 2:18:31.160]  police are also into gold. So the gold is bad. I'm not kidding. You can't, it's insane
[2:18:31.160 --> 2:18:35.720]  asylum. Well, just to put the relationship that Ron Paul has something to do with terrorism
[2:18:35.720 --> 2:18:41.200]  and and, uh, and militia is just the biggest. Well, number one, militias aren't bad either.
[2:18:41.200 --> 2:18:46.200]  They say white supremacists want to kill cops, militia. Then they tie that into Ron Paul.
[2:18:46.200 --> 2:18:50.760]  Well, and, you know, obviously George Washington was a member of a militia. Is that a bad thing?
[2:18:50.760 --> 2:18:55.840]  We got a free nation because of it. The United States stands on its own because we have militias
[2:18:55.840 --> 2:19:01.280]  Ted, we have one minute left. Give folks the coin over. This is coins at 888 90 level when
[2:19:01.280 --> 2:19:06.280]  it's at 930 right now. Cannot beat this deal, folks. Give them the number. Oh, and what
[2:19:06.280 --> 2:19:10.760]  about silver? Ted? Yeah, we still have some silver. I gotta tell you, silver is a very
[2:19:10.760 --> 2:19:16.880]  short supply. I'm currently recommending the Franklin haves that they're at 869. Can't
[2:19:16.880 --> 2:19:23.800]  beat that deal. Let me give folks the number 800 686 2237. I mean, you've got silver folks.
[2:19:23.800 --> 2:19:27.680]  You can't find silver at that price. I know. I look, believe me, this, these deals are
[2:19:27.680 --> 2:19:36.080]  great. 800 686 2237 800 686 237. You have sovereigns at great prices. Frank's at great
[2:19:36.080 --> 2:19:40.800]  prices. Silver us half dollars at great prices. Right, Ted? In addition to this, I've got
[2:19:40.800 --> 2:19:45.840]  Eagles. I have proof Eagles, which are almost unheard of. I mean, I was really able to pick
[2:19:45.840 --> 2:19:49.600]  up a neat little supply of things. If you're looking for things for gold and silver in
[2:19:49.600 --> 2:19:53.760]  the market, give us a call now. But you gotta tell them it's the Alex Jones special to get

[2:21:01.800 --> 2:21:07.720]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've
[2:21:07.720 --> 2:21:14.000]  got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:19.560]  as well-funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[2:21:19.560 --> 2:21:24.240]  the best interest of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged
[2:21:24.240 --> 2:21:28.960]  since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[2:21:28.960 --> 2:21:34.960]  of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and
[2:21:34.960 --> 2:21:40.360]  finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world
[2:21:40.360 --> 2:21:46.920]  government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real
[2:21:46.920 --> 2:21:53.920]  agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in superhigh

[2:22:01.800 --> 2:22:05.720]  Hello, this is Peter Cronch Novel from Midos Resources and I'd like to share some thoughts
[2:22:05.720 --> 2:22:10.680]  with you. In today's economy, with the government spending on wild, the banking system on the
[2:22:10.680 --> 2:22:15.760]  verge of collapse, and Wall Street and continuous freefall, we both know that it's critical
[2:22:15.760 --> 2:22:20.080]  that you protect your savings and retirement programs now. Macro-economics can be very
[2:22:20.080 --> 2:22:24.840]  confusing, but the solution to securing your personal assets is very simple. It's purchase
[2:22:24.840 --> 2:22:28.960]  of gold and silver. These precious metals have been the trusted means of exchange for
[2:22:28.960 --> 2:22:33.560]  centuries, and they've never been more important in our country's history. It's up to you
[2:22:33.560 --> 2:22:38.480]  to design your survival plan, one based on gold and silver. Give me a call at Peter
[2:22:38.480 --> 2:22:45.640]  Cronch Novel at 800-686-2237, extension 108, and allow me to outline an easy answer to
[2:22:45.640 --> 2:22:53.280]  your questions. That's Peter Cronch Novel at 1800-686-2237, extension 108. Call Peter
[2:22:53.280 --> 2:23:01.120]  Cronch Novel at 1800-686-2237, extension 108, while you can still purchase gold with paper.
[2:23:01.120 --> 2:23:05.640]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and
[2:23:05.640 --> 2:23:10.800]  what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future. In these troubled times, one of the
[2:23:10.800 --> 2:23:14.880]  most important things your family can have is good health. Some of the contributors to
[2:23:14.880 --> 2:23:20.120]  poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals. It's a documented fact.
[2:23:20.120 --> 2:23:26.080]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and
[2:23:26.080 --> 2:23:31.480]  parasitic infection. Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol
[2:23:31.480 --> 2:23:37.560]  naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with
[2:23:37.560 --> 2:23:43.800]  your favorite beverage once a day. FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[2:23:43.800 --> 2:23:50.680]  A two-month supply starts at just $17. FPP is so affordable you can't afford to do without.

[2:25:37.680 --> 2:25:43.480]  We're coming straight on for Barack Obama at the height of his power. We're not waiting.
[2:25:43.480 --> 2:25:50.080]  We launched our operation months ago and now the info weapon has dropped. The Obama deception

[2:26:15.480 --> 2:26:20.240]  Ted, again, I'm not kidding. When it says it demonizes gold owners, it's in here. When
[2:26:20.240 --> 2:26:25.080]  it says, you know, when I say that it demonizes the bill of rights, the Constitution, the Second
[2:26:25.080 --> 2:26:28.640]  Amendment, it says they got to have more gun control and mix them with killing cops. You
[2:26:28.640 --> 2:26:32.720]  got to do it if you're killing cops. And it admits North Com and FEMA counts, but now
[2:26:32.720 --> 2:26:36.360]  it says they're good when the previous one said it didn't exist. North American Union
[2:26:36.360 --> 2:26:43.480]  is good. We need to accept it. It, Ron Paul is bad. Let me just read this to people. It
[2:26:43.480 --> 2:26:48.280]  says political paraphernalia and they will arrest you. I've got state police on tape
[2:26:48.280 --> 2:26:52.240]  thinking by Constitutions, illegal militia members, most commonly associated with third
[2:26:52.240 --> 2:26:56.520]  party political groups. It is not uncommon for militia members. Again, like that's illegal
[2:26:56.520 --> 2:27:00.560]  to display constitutional party campaign for liberty or libertarian material. These members
[2:27:00.560 --> 2:27:06.440]  are usually supporters of former presidential candidate Ron Paul, Chuck Baldwin, or bombard.
[2:27:06.440 --> 2:27:10.480]  This is their anti government propaganda. And there's another key part of here. I meant
[2:27:10.480 --> 2:27:15.200]  to tell you about Ted. I don't want to mark up though the actual document. Oh, it says
[2:27:15.200 --> 2:27:22.480]  public groups. This is on page five down at the bottom. It says third paragraph at the
[2:27:22.480 --> 2:27:27.200]  bottom public groups. These organizations hold training events that are open to the public
[2:27:27.200 --> 2:27:32.000]  and generally recruit publicly. These groups desire to aid the county sheriff or governor
[2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:35.840]  in emergency, such as a natural disaster. It is not uncommon for these groups to be
[2:27:35.840 --> 2:27:40.520]  seen in public doing community service related work. Public groups are less likely to publicly
[2:27:40.520 --> 2:27:44.800]  push malicious rhetoric than have a traditional military style chain of command and leadership
[2:27:44.800 --> 2:27:48.520]  structure. These groups have been known to form underground units provide training and
[2:27:48.520 --> 2:27:55.320]  guidance to new or forming organizations who they who and I've gotten the Austin manuals
[2:27:55.320 --> 2:28:00.160]  before and where they are. I think we scan them in. It says just public groups that speak
[2:28:00.160 --> 2:28:03.680]  out against government corruption. They're probably secret terrorists. Ted, what do you
[2:28:03.680 --> 2:28:10.600]  think of this? Well, Alex, I mean, there's always been this media draw toward demonizing
[2:28:10.600 --> 2:28:16.320]  the militias of the United States of America, uh, you know, going all the way back to, uh,
[2:28:16.320 --> 2:28:21.800]  well, the big one was Oklahoma City and that bombing that went on over there. Uh, you know,
[2:28:21.800 --> 2:28:26.120]  but what what what people don't realize is that it's the militias that create created
[2:28:26.120 --> 2:28:30.880]  this free nation to start with. And it's in the constitution that we get to have militia.
[2:28:30.880 --> 2:28:37.960]  No, no, no evil ban them. Well, anyways, I mean, just just that whole thing, Alex,
[2:28:37.960 --> 2:28:44.080]  I mean, it and it and it's the, uh, it's the media that wants to create this, this light
[2:28:44.080 --> 2:28:49.680]  on the, on, on, on, on the militias and obviously do away with the, uh, the second amendment
[2:28:49.680 --> 2:28:50.680]  all together.
[2:28:50.680 --> 2:28:53.640]  That means they're scared of it and they're scared of Ron Paul and they're scared of
[2:28:53.640 --> 2:28:57.600]  us. Ted, just throwing this out there real fast, though, I held you over. Tell folks
[2:28:57.600 --> 2:29:00.800]  because I forgot that's why I held you over. You said you have some other coins at that
[2:29:00.800 --> 2:29:01.880]  insane price.
[2:29:01.880 --> 2:29:07.320]  Yeah, it is a matter of fact, I do. Um, I was able to pick up a small quantity of
[2:29:07.320 --> 2:29:12.200]  proof eagles. I have some regular us eagles, which are, I mean, the us mince out of them
[2:29:12.200 --> 2:29:17.480]  again, you know, it's only February and they don't have any more to sell. Uh, if we, we
[2:29:17.480 --> 2:29:21.800]  have the, uh, I just have a list of different coins. I mean, you can call the brokers and
[2:29:21.800 --> 2:29:25.480]  ask for them, make sure when you do that, you mentioned that you heard it on the Alex
[2:29:25.480 --> 2:29:29.640]  Jones show. So you have the opportunity to buy this stuff. I mean, this is the stuff
[2:29:29.640 --> 2:29:33.680]  that I bought one gold was at eight, this is the offer on the show. It's a little bit
[2:29:33.680 --> 2:29:38.960]  more. If you don't say it's the offer, 800 686 2237 brokers will be there till midnight.
[2:29:38.960 --> 2:29:43.880]  Take advantage. Ted, take your spending time with us. Yeah, you bet, Alex. 800 686 237.
[2:29:43.880 --> 2:29:47.000]  All right, we're going to come back, jam in calls, go to our next guest transmission
[2:29:47.000 --> 2:29:51.760]  continue. Stay with us.

[2:31:02.120 --> 2:31:08.240]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've
[2:31:08.240 --> 2:31:12.920]  got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[2:31:12.920 --> 2:31:18.400]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[2:31:18.400 --> 2:31:23.000]  the best interest of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged
[2:31:23.000 --> 2:31:27.720]  since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement

[2:33:01.320 --> 2:33:16.880]  Yeah, the establishment's going crazy on us, saying that people that own gold, people that
[2:33:16.880 --> 2:33:22.880]  own guns, people that support Bob Barr, Ron Paul, Constitution Party, Libertarian Party,
[2:33:22.880 --> 2:33:28.080]  they're terrorists that want to kill cops. This is to demonize the true threat to the
[2:33:28.080 --> 2:33:33.520]  world. We've got right on our side. We know the truth. We've been right about everything.
[2:33:33.520 --> 2:33:38.760]  We're laying it out. The people are rallying and waking up. And the Obama deception has
[2:33:38.760 --> 2:33:44.880]  dropped. It is now at Prison Point of Dodd TV. God bless all of you out there taking
[2:33:44.880 --> 2:33:53.120]  action. For the show ends, I'm going to go through some more, line by line, of them
[2:33:53.120 --> 2:33:58.560]  saying we're all terrorists. Yeah, well, the founder said that when you attack the Miller
[2:33:58.560 --> 2:34:05.400]  Rights Constitution, American people, that you are the treasonous traitors. But we're
[2:34:05.400 --> 2:34:08.640]  getting this from the police, so they don't like it either. I mean, it's getting a little
[2:34:08.640 --> 2:34:14.240]  too obvious. You know, I was kept telling him on the phone, and she said, no, it says
[2:34:14.240 --> 2:34:17.280]  Ron Paul. And he goes, no, it doesn't. I'm like, we think I'm making this up. It says
[2:34:17.280 --> 2:34:22.080]  Ron Paul. And he goes, oh my gosh, he does say it. On the next to last page. All right,
[2:34:22.080 --> 2:34:25.240]  let's jam in some calls very quickly here. I love hearing from you. We got a guest coming
[2:34:25.240 --> 2:34:29.560]  up and a bunch of other stuff to cover. And I got the side hershing is I got to cover.
[2:34:29.560 --> 2:34:34.360]  That's coming up before the doctor joins us. Let's go to Cliff in Oklahoma. You are on
[2:34:34.360 --> 2:34:39.400]  the air and are you a terrorist because you love freedom, sir? Well, apparently I am Alex
[2:34:39.400 --> 2:34:44.440]  because I just got pulled over by a cop a couple of nights ago. And I think you need
[2:34:44.440 --> 2:34:49.840]  to hear this story because I like to put Liberty stickers on the back of my car. Oh, Liberty
[2:34:49.840 --> 2:35:01.680]  stickers.com. Oh, Liberty. Oh, oh, please stop. I'll try to get easy on you. No, but
[2:35:01.680 --> 2:35:07.200]  I have different stickers. One that says I support Ron Paul and another one that says
[2:35:07.200 --> 2:35:15.200]  I do not consent to being searched, you know, percent of the Fourth Amendment. And anyways,
[2:35:15.200 --> 2:35:20.520]  I'm driving through this construction zone speed, speed trap going up to Edmund, which
[2:35:20.520 --> 2:35:31.480]  is home of police chief Bob Rex from Waco fame. And anyways, I get pulled over and a cop
[2:35:31.480 --> 2:35:35.600]  comes up to my window and you know, it's kind of weird because I'm following the flow of
[2:35:35.600 --> 2:35:41.040]  traffic. Everybody else is going as fast as I am. And he follows me for about half a minute
[2:35:41.040 --> 2:35:46.760]  before even turns a siren on. And I pull over, he comes in, I give him my license and registration,
[2:35:46.760 --> 2:35:53.320]  got the window rolled down. And I say, what am I, you know, what was that I did, officer?
[2:35:53.320 --> 2:35:57.960]  And he told me I was speeding. I, you know, just question the fact that I had multiple
[2:35:57.960 --> 2:36:05.120]  cars beside me that were going the same speed. Well, then he tells me right after I say that,
[2:36:05.120 --> 2:36:10.360]  he said, all right, get out of the car right now. And I said, I said, I said, am I being
[2:36:10.360 --> 2:36:15.640]  detained officer? And he goes, he goes out of the car right now. And I'm just like, I'm
[2:36:15.640 --> 2:36:19.840]  just asking you a question. Am I being detained? And then he says, get out on the take further
[2:36:19.840 --> 2:36:25.680]  action. Well, I went ahead and get out, got out after that point. And I, you know, I roll
[2:36:25.680 --> 2:36:30.040]  my window up, I lock my doors and everything. I get out. And I said, officer, I just need
[2:36:30.040 --> 2:36:34.280]  to ask you a question. What if I'm being detained or not? Well, then he says, get in my car
[2:36:34.280 --> 2:36:37.920]  right now. I thought he was saying getting back seat or he's gonna arrest me or something.
[2:36:37.920 --> 2:36:42.360]  Well, he has to get in front of his car. As I'm getting in the car, he slams the door
[2:36:42.360 --> 2:36:48.480]  real hard and it closes in on my body as I'm getting into the car. So it slams the heart
[2:36:48.480 --> 2:36:53.520]  and knocked me into the rest of the car, basically. And he wanted to get you out from
[2:36:53.520 --> 2:36:57.520]  in front of the camera. He wanted to abuse you when the camera, his squad car camera
[2:36:57.520 --> 2:37:03.520]  wasn't on you. Exactly. And I want to stress that while I was talking to him, I did not
[2:37:03.520 --> 2:37:07.120]  get, I did not start freaking out or anything. No, I understand you're not allowed. He was
[2:37:07.120 --> 2:37:10.880]  about the taser you have. You hadn't got out and then you're not allowed to talk to him
[2:37:10.880 --> 2:37:14.480]  cause this, you know, cause you're a terrorist. You got a Ron Paul sticker. Please continue.
[2:37:14.480 --> 2:37:22.480]  Okay. So, so anyway, I'm in the car and he gets in and he says, he says, you were disobeying
[2:37:22.480 --> 2:37:26.800]  my orders to get out of the car. I said, all I want to know is why I'm being detained.
[2:37:26.800 --> 2:37:31.920]  And I told him, I said, I said, the officer, you know, what you just did, slam me in the
[2:37:31.920 --> 2:37:35.720]  car like that. I don't, I didn't slam you in the car. Let me stress you didn't slam
[2:37:35.720 --> 2:37:39.560]  me in the car. He slammed the door into me as I was getting in the car. I understand.
[2:37:39.560 --> 2:37:44.680]  Yeah. I said, I said, what you did to qualify as assault or excessive force on me. I've
[2:37:44.680 --> 2:37:49.360]  been cooperating with you and I just asked you a question. And, and so he just, you know,
[2:37:49.360 --> 2:37:53.720]  he starts playing list and I know what the Supreme Court says and you know, I don't need
[2:37:53.720 --> 2:38:00.360]  your junior high argument to your bumper sticker argument. And I mean, like right there, that
[2:38:00.360 --> 2:38:04.320]  was like profiling to me. So how did you know he's letting you know it's the bumper sticker.
[2:38:04.320 --> 2:38:10.680]  You don't, the fourth amendment is like Satanism to him. So America is bad. So, so what happens
[2:38:10.680 --> 2:38:11.680]  next?
[2:38:11.680 --> 2:38:17.840]  So, so anyways, he starts, uh, lecture me about, uh, about having, you know, broken
[2:38:17.840 --> 2:38:22.040]  the speed limit, which, which yeah, I probably was going down faster when I first entered
[2:38:22.040 --> 2:38:27.160]  that construction zone. But, um, so we're three or four other cars right ahead of me.
[2:38:27.160 --> 2:38:31.160]  No, no, the speed ramps are done like that by design, but so how did this end?
[2:38:31.160 --> 2:38:35.440]  Well, anyways, uh, anyways, I thought he was going to search my car. I've had problems
[2:38:35.440 --> 2:38:39.880]  with these Edmund cops before, uh, and I'd, I'd, I'd abbreviate it to their wonderful
[2:38:39.880 --> 2:38:45.000]  police chief, but, um, anyways, he starts writing me the ticket and he continues to
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:49.120]  tell me about how I didn't cooperate with him and everything. And I, you know, I wasn't
[2:38:49.120 --> 2:38:52.840]  going to just, just let him walk all over me. And I, and I, I kept on talking to him.
[2:38:52.840 --> 2:38:57.560]  I said, you know, I, I was just asking you a question. I didn't delay anything. I made
[2:38:57.560 --> 2:39:01.520]  no shifty movements to make you feel that I was a threat to you. I got out of the car,
[2:39:01.520 --> 2:39:06.080]  uh, you know, after you started screaming at me and it's, oh, you write the ticket and
[2:39:06.080 --> 2:39:10.360]  you get out of here. And, and that was it. I was really shocked. I mean, I was scared
[2:39:10.360 --> 2:39:14.920]  that he was going to do something, but just the fact that he, uh, I feel that as profiled,
[2:39:14.920 --> 2:39:17.480]  um, that he wouldn't allow me to ask him.
[2:39:17.480 --> 2:39:23.800]  No, no, no, no, that should be the headline. Ron Paul, libertarians, gold owners, gun owners
[2:39:23.800 --> 2:39:28.600]  were being profiled because they tell the cops that we're a danger to them and that
[2:39:28.600 --> 2:39:32.920]  we may kill them. And I mean, and they give them all this propaganda and it's a load
[2:39:32.920 --> 2:39:37.840]  of bull. You know, it doesn't mean they won't tell them that the illegal aliens statistically
[2:39:37.840 --> 2:39:41.960]  are the real ones killing them. No, it's got to be Americans. We've got to pay. We've got
[2:39:41.960 --> 2:39:45.960]  to be taught, sir. I appreciate your call. Now see, I got all these callers and I just
[2:39:45.960 --> 2:39:49.160]  spent five, six minutes with Cliff, but I had to, and I want to get to Simon, Justin
[2:39:49.160 --> 2:39:58.080]  Joseph, Susie and others. We've got the Dr. Carly coming up. Oh man. It's all just crazy
[2:39:58.080 --> 2:40:03.960]  in here. Um, this is bird flu thing. I mean, this is serious. We need to have a part two
[2:40:03.960 --> 2:40:08.120]  on this and expand on it, but I'm going to get some other news in as we cover it before
[2:40:08.120 --> 2:40:13.520]  we go to Dr. Carly and then your calls. Hirsch, Cheney ran SS style political assassination
[2:40:13.520 --> 2:40:19.760]  unit. This is up on prisonplanet.com right now. Paul Joseph Watson, award winning investigative
[2:40:19.760 --> 2:40:24.440]  reporter Seymour Hirsch dropped another bombshell this week when he revealed that the former,
[2:40:24.440 --> 2:40:27.240]  this guy's always been proven to be a hundred percent accurate. Hirsch is just incredible.
[2:40:27.240 --> 2:40:31.720]  He broke the torture camps in Vietnam in, you know, the early seventies. I mean, it's
[2:40:31.720 --> 2:40:36.280]  just, you know, that they lied about WMD's that they were staging terror attacks inside
[2:40:36.280 --> 2:40:41.400]  Iran using Al Qaeda because Iran sheite their arch enemy. Now that's all mainstream news
[2:40:41.400 --> 2:40:45.280]  that Cheney wanted to stage terror attacks against us ships and blame it on Al Qaeda.
[2:40:45.280 --> 2:40:51.160]  That's confirmed. That's mainstream news. I told John Gibson that on Fox yesterday and
[2:40:51.160 --> 2:40:58.280]  he just laughed at me. Oh, sure. Oh, more conspiracy theories. Um, this is New Yorker magazine
[2:40:58.280 --> 2:41:03.640]  writer, Pulitzer prize winner award winning investigative reporter Seymour Hirsch dropped
[2:41:03.640 --> 2:41:06.680]  another bombshell this week when he revealed the former vice president Dick Cheney had
[2:41:06.680 --> 2:41:11.840]  his own SS style political assassination unit that reported directly to him.
[2:41:11.840 --> 2:41:15.920]  Hirsch told University of Minnesota audience Tuesday after 9 11. I haven't written about
[2:41:15.920 --> 2:41:20.360]  this yet, but the central intelligence agency was very deeply involved in domestic activities
[2:41:20.360 --> 2:41:24.400]  against people. They thought to be enemies of the state without any legal authority for
[2:41:24.400 --> 2:41:30.440]  it. They weren't. They haven't been called on it yet. So that's people inside the United
[2:41:30.440 --> 2:41:34.400]  States with the CIA. Well, yeah, they're setting up local offices of it and hiring every near
[2:41:34.400 --> 2:41:38.440]  to all you can imagine. Hirsch then went on to describe how the joint special operations
[2:41:38.440 --> 2:41:43.160]  command was an executive assassination unit that carried out political assassinations
[2:41:43.160 --> 2:41:49.880]  abroad. It is a special wing of our special operations community that is set up independently.
[2:41:49.880 --> 2:41:54.560]  He explained they do not report to anybody except in the Bush Cheney days that reported
[2:41:54.560 --> 2:41:58.400]  directly to Cheney's office. Congress has no oversight over it.
[2:41:58.400 --> 2:42:02.840]  Guys, I meant to call Paul when I saw he'd written this article this morning. I saw
[2:42:02.840 --> 2:42:08.520]  it break last night. Get the speech last night to the university. We've been in contact
[2:42:08.520 --> 2:42:13.960]  with Hirsch. We talked to him again yesterday. And he keeps saying to come on and break something
[2:42:13.960 --> 2:42:17.120]  big here and he likes us and knows who we are. Okay, well, I'm ready, Hirsch. I'm ready.
[2:42:17.120 --> 2:42:24.480]  I've been waiting six months. He's really nice guy. You can call him up on the phone,
[2:42:24.480 --> 2:42:36.960]  I can't get him on the show. It goes on here. What I want you guys to Google and this is
[2:42:36.960 --> 2:42:42.600]  from six years ago. So let me think of the exact headline. UPI first broke it then Reuters
[2:42:42.600 --> 2:42:49.360]  reported it. Headline Israel to carry out assassinations inside United States. Google
[2:42:49.360 --> 2:42:53.240]  that Israel to carry out assassination during the U.S. inside the United States. Israel
[2:42:53.240 --> 2:42:55.880]  to carry out assassinations inside the U.S. That should have been added to this, but I
[2:42:55.880 --> 2:42:59.240]  know they didn't think of that. That's what I do is I think of all little angles and past
[2:42:59.240 --> 2:43:04.040]  things, sort of the guys, but a lot of times I contribute behind the scenes of the articles.
[2:43:04.040 --> 2:43:07.480]  Just to point out that this is announced that foreign governments are allowed to come here
[2:43:07.480 --> 2:43:16.760]  and kill U.S. citizens. But revelation that Cheney had his own private assassination units
[2:43:16.760 --> 2:43:22.680]  not too far removed from Hitler's notorious essay, the much feared paramilitary wing of
[2:43:22.680 --> 2:43:28.520]  the Nazi party who used to beat, torture and kill political opponents of the Nazi party
[2:43:28.520 --> 2:43:33.720]  in the 30s. Germany and the Waffen SS, who were later used in the war to carry out executions
[2:43:33.720 --> 2:43:38.000]  and war crimes. The essay were later targeted by Hitler during the night of the Long Knives,
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:43.000]  a brutal purge to eliminate political adversaries both inside and outside the Nazi party. Hundreds
[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:50.000]  of people were executed in cold blood by the Gestapo and the SS, trimmillions. Tellingly,
[2:43:50.000 --> 2:43:55.520]  German courts and cabinets quickly swept aside centuries of legal prohibition against extra-judicial
[2:43:55.520 --> 2:44:01.840]  killings to demonstrate their loyalty to Hitler. The Waffen SS, which means armed FS, was deemed
[2:44:01.840 --> 2:44:06.480]  beyond prosecution, despite it blatantly being involved in egregious and ongoing war crimes
[2:44:06.480 --> 2:44:11.120]  as well as domestic assassinations. The Joint Special Operations Command, Cheney's assassination
[2:44:11.120 --> 2:44:17.640]  unit, is also described as a extra-legal operation. It is an executive assassination
[2:44:17.640 --> 2:44:22.360]  ring, and it has been going on and on and on, her stated. Under President Bush's authority,
[2:44:22.360 --> 2:44:26.920]  they've been going into countries, not talking to the ambassador or the CIA station chief,
[2:44:26.920 --> 2:44:32.280]  and finding people on the list and executing them and leaving. That's been going on in
[2:44:32.280 --> 2:44:38.200]  the name of all of us. It's still going on. None of Obama's reversals of Bush's executive
[2:44:38.200 --> 2:44:42.600]  orders say anything about abolishing the Joint Special Forces Command. Indeed, the specialist
[2:44:42.600 --> 2:44:48.520]  unit is a different part of Obama's vastly expanding bombing, expanded bombing raids
[2:44:48.520 --> 2:44:56.080]  and other incursions into Pakistan. Let's go ahead now and play the clip that Obermann
[2:44:56.080 --> 2:45:02.120]  played last night from Hirsch yesterday before a university audience hears the audio.
[2:45:02.120 --> 2:45:06.440]  The defenders of Bush's ghost may have more to worry about tomorrow and in the near future
[2:45:06.440 --> 2:45:11.560]  than the relative records of Bush and Obama on signing statements and on Hussein and everything
[2:45:11.560 --> 2:45:18.240]  else. Cheney assassination squads. What does that mean, Cheney assassination squads?
[2:45:18.240 --> 2:45:22.840]  An amazing thing happened in Minnesota last night. There was a forum with the investigative
[2:45:22.840 --> 2:45:29.760]  reporter Seymour Hirsch and former Vice President Walter Mondale. In the Q&A session, Hirsch
[2:45:29.760 --> 2:45:36.680]  let slip that he's working on a book that will include reporting about Cheney-sponsored
[2:45:36.680 --> 2:45:44.880]  assassination rings, as Hirsch put it, that went around the local CIA station chiefs abroad
[2:45:44.880 --> 2:45:53.800]  to carry out assassinations on targets using apparently military personnel. Now, obviously
[2:45:53.800 --> 2:45:59.160]  that's very sketchy. We need to know a lot more about it. I think Hirsch is going to
[2:45:59.160 --> 2:46:03.680]  want to make us wait until his book comes out. But clearly, there's a lot more that
[2:46:03.680 --> 2:46:09.240]  happened in that Bush administration directly out of the Vice President's office that we
[2:46:09.240 --> 2:46:13.240]  don't know about yet and that Keith will curl our hair.
[2:46:13.240 --> 2:46:17.680]  Well, now we know what happened when he shot Henry Whittington, or Harry Whittington, in
[2:46:17.680 --> 2:46:18.680]  the phrase.
[2:46:18.680 --> 2:46:23.080]  All right, guys, we also have a clip from the university, don't we? We have an audio
[2:46:23.080 --> 2:46:27.080]  clip of that? Okay, that's the clip I thought we were going to. Let's go to that in just
[2:46:27.080 --> 2:46:30.680]  a moment and we'll go to our guests in the next segment. I apologize, but this must be
[2:46:30.680 --> 2:46:38.880]  covered. It came out two weeks ago. The memos were released saying that they were going
[2:46:38.880 --> 2:46:43.120]  to set up a dictatorship and the president was basically above all laws and Congress
[2:46:43.120 --> 2:46:48.960]  and that they could ban and arrest, press and shut down free speech in America. And
[2:46:48.960 --> 2:46:52.920]  they tell the CIA and FBI to be involved in this and they go, oh, absolutely, we love
[2:46:52.920 --> 2:46:58.000]  it. That's what freedom is. Secret arrest, secret camp, secret police. Then they grab
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:03.560]  these al-Qaeda people who are just minions and they hold them for seven years with torture
[2:47:03.560 --> 2:47:06.680]  and then release a press release where they confess and they've been caught putting out
[2:47:06.680 --> 2:47:09.840]  fake confessions before.
[2:47:09.840 --> 2:47:13.680]  Where is the talk of bringing Dick Cheney to justice? Where is the talk of bringing
[2:47:13.680 --> 2:47:21.120]  Rumsfeld and Bush to justice? Nothing from Obama. And I just remembered, I didn't even
[2:47:21.120 --> 2:47:24.240]  put that in the Obama deception. I'm not poo poo in my own film, but let me write a note
[2:47:24.240 --> 2:47:26.640]  right now because I'm going to give me a pen because I'm going to go ahead the next two
[2:47:26.640 --> 2:47:32.120]  weeks, put out Obama deception, 1.5. And I'm just going to down and dirty sit down in
[2:47:32.120 --> 2:47:35.920]  the studio, go over the facts of that. That's the big one. I didn't put in the film because
[2:47:35.920 --> 2:47:41.000]  you can't put it all. He is now, well, I did put in there that he's protecting Bush and
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:44.400]  then he's supporting torture and blocking investigations. We do cover it, but I want
[2:47:44.400 --> 2:47:47.320]  to get more into that.
[2:47:47.320 --> 2:47:56.360]  Protecting Bush. What am I doing? And continuing all of the programs. And people think we exaggerate.
[2:47:56.360 --> 2:48:02.360]  No, there's no way you want to read this eight page report. The feds put out the state police
[2:48:02.360 --> 2:48:07.400]  around the country with the governor seal in Missouri. That's just one version. We got
[2:48:07.400 --> 2:48:16.520]  California stuff right here too. And to read this, it's worse than I'm saying you've got
[2:48:16.520 --> 2:48:22.320]  to go to info wars.com and prisonplanet.com. I know Paul said he was writing another more
[2:48:22.320 --> 2:48:26.360]  detailed story because Kurt rushed this out quickly, did a great job, a lengthy report.
[2:48:26.360 --> 2:48:33.880]  But let me just see if that's up on prisonplanet.com yet. Go to the main page of that while it's
[2:48:33.880 --> 2:48:42.680]  loading. Ron Paul culprits of financial collapse should be arrested. And that's a good story
[2:48:42.680 --> 2:48:46.880]  I asked him to do from his interview with us a few days ago. Hersh Cheney ran SS top
[2:48:46.880 --> 2:48:53.240]  political assassination unit. Hope change progress in the Obama deception. So I guess
[2:48:53.240 --> 2:48:57.600]  he's still working on it. Secret police report Ron Paul Bob bar Chuck Baldwin. Libertarians
[2:48:57.600 --> 2:49:03.360]  are terrorists. That's Curtin M. O's story. So I guess Paul's doing a more detailed one
[2:49:03.360 --> 2:49:13.480]  tying it into everything. But just mind blowing. Absolutely mind blowing. But but yeah, Obama
[2:49:13.480 --> 2:49:18.320]  2.5 will be all the interviews with Tarpoli, Jesse Ventura, George Humphrey, all the things
[2:49:18.320 --> 2:49:22.040]  we couldn't add in the just under two hour film. It's an hour and 12 minutes, eight minutes
[2:49:22.040 --> 2:49:26.000]  under two hours. And there's 30 minutes of extras. But those are going up tomorrow at
[2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:31.200]  prisonplanet.tv and shipping on on the DVDs next week and expending. But again, I cannot
[2:49:31.200 --> 2:49:35.400]  stress enough that the Obama deception shatters the left right paradigm. That means when you
[2:49:35.400 --> 2:49:40.240]  show a Democrat this they doesn't come out with a right wing mainline view. So they shut
[2:49:40.240 --> 2:49:43.560]  off thinking process. This is what can get through to them so they can see they're being
[2:49:43.560 --> 2:49:48.120]  deceived. Remember all those poor Bush people who we couldn't wake up because you're coming.
[2:49:48.120 --> 2:49:51.840]  You don't like but I'm like no Bush is tripling the size of government. He's saying he's setting
[2:49:51.840 --> 2:49:56.160]  up a dictatorship. No, he's not. And now they're like, well look Bush left office. We told
[2:49:56.160 --> 2:50:00.240]  you he was going to do that. It's the office that has the dictatorial power that the private
[2:50:00.240 --> 2:50:06.360]  interest control. So again, please go to info wars.com and preorder the DVD. It ships out
[2:50:06.360 --> 2:50:10.920]  next week. Please get the high quality. That's how this masterpiece needs to be seen as on
[2:50:10.920 --> 2:50:15.880]  the DVD. That's how it needs to be made copies. But it looks pretty darn good at prisonplanet.tv
[2:50:15.880 --> 2:50:22.640]  compared to other stuff I see on the web. It really crisp and nice. And I want folks
[2:50:22.640 --> 2:50:26.360]  to get prisonplanet.tv memberships because you get the couple hours a day I do here.
[2:50:26.360 --> 2:50:30.080]  Sometimes the whole show sometimes an hour but always over on average a week every two

[2:51:04.160 --> 2:51:08.640]  has been initiated with the recent bailout. International bankers and power brokers have
[2:51:08.640 --> 2:51:13.080]  engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new world bank to act as
[2:51:13.080 --> 2:51:17.160]  savior. But we've only seen the beginning. Their next engineered crisis will be on a
[2:51:17.160 --> 2:51:22.280]  scale never before seen in modern times. Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic
[2:51:22.280 --> 2:51:26.560]  across the land. The insiders have discovered that they must control two things to cease
[2:51:26.560 --> 2:51:32.360]  total power. Phase one is a one world currency which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[2:51:32.360 --> 2:51:39.840]  Phase two of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies. Go to www.foodshortagesusa.com

[2:52:01.880 --> 2:52:07.760]  On the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've
[2:52:07.760 --> 2:52:13.960]  got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just
[2:52:13.960 --> 2:52:19.640]  as well funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[2:52:19.640 --> 2:52:24.600]  the best interest of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, fudged since
[2:52:24.600 --> 2:52:29.760]  day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[2:52:29.760 --> 2:52:36.640]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[2:52:36.640 --> 2:52:39.800]  that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about
[2:52:39.800 --> 2:52:46.440]  a one world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told,
[2:52:46.440 --> 2:52:53.360]  and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download

[2:54:32.960 --> 2:55:01.960]  up and not being cowards. And I know you're not doing that. I love you.
[2:55:01.960 --> 2:55:14.920]  Look at who's in there. He's going, look at this idiot, Alex, acting stupid. That's
[2:55:14.920 --> 2:55:19.920]  what it's all about, bro. I'm just joking. Let's go to Dr. Rebecca Carley for the rest
[2:55:19.920 --> 2:55:24.200]  of this hour and the whole of the next hour. We'll open the phones up in about 30 minutes
[2:55:24.200 --> 2:55:28.200]  for everybody holding on the issue of the bird flu. Dr. Rebecca Carley is a medical
[2:55:28.200 --> 2:55:33.080]  doctor, a surgeon by trade. Her son got vaccine damage. She been investigated. And I think
[2:55:33.080 --> 2:55:35.880]  some of her research is some of the best I've seen out there because I've done a lot of
[2:55:35.880 --> 2:55:40.200]  this research myself from, you know, mainline government sources that aren't publicized
[2:55:40.200 --> 2:55:44.200]  but are public. You know, they're there. They're not widely put out. And so her stuff just
[2:55:44.200 --> 2:55:49.360]  clicks. And so I wanted, you know, reintroduce what happened, what broke last week, what
[2:55:49.360 --> 2:55:53.280]  happened a few months ago, why it's so serious. And then let's get into the big picture, doctor.
[2:55:53.280 --> 2:55:58.320]  I really appreciate you coming on today. And I appreciate the opportunity. And before we
[2:55:58.320 --> 2:56:02.360]  get into that, I was listening to your show earlier talking about the Alabama shooter.
[2:56:02.360 --> 2:56:07.040]  The Alabama shooter. I totally agree with you that he was most likely on Prozac or some
[2:56:07.040 --> 2:56:11.120]  other psychotropic med. Well, it's coming out the German. It's coming out. The German
[2:56:11.120 --> 2:56:14.960]  was under psychiatric care, so he's guaranteed on it. But go ahead. Right. I just want to
[2:56:14.960 --> 2:56:19.720]  bring out the fact that vaccinations can also cause violent behavior. There's an excellent
[2:56:19.720 --> 2:56:24.320]  book entitled Vaccination, Social Violence and Criminality by Harris Coulter, which the
[2:56:24.320 --> 2:56:29.040]  listeners can obtain from ThinkToyce.com. And there's certain areas of the brain that
[2:56:29.040 --> 2:56:34.560]  in fact lead you to become violent. I have in front of me a book published by NATO, North
[2:56:34.560 --> 2:56:41.280]  Atlantic Treaty Organization, called the Biology of Aggression, which is, let's see, it's over
[2:56:41.280 --> 2:56:47.120]  600 pages long. They're actually researching to see what areas of the brain they can affect
[2:56:47.120 --> 2:56:52.720]  to make people violent. And they're using rabies virus to do so. Yes. Now, doctor, I've
[2:56:52.720 --> 2:56:57.080]  read the medical major university and medical facility reports. But for those that don't
[2:56:57.080 --> 2:57:02.360]  know why it causes it or the brain damage, normally it is a autoimmune response, massive
[2:57:02.360 --> 2:57:08.800]  brain swelling. And as we all know, brain damage is associated with violent outbursts
[2:57:08.800 --> 2:57:13.440]  and a loss of impulse control. And of course, there's other chemical reasons it does it.
[2:57:13.440 --> 2:57:17.520]  But is that not basically the main reason? Yes, that's completely correct. Once you
[2:57:17.520 --> 2:57:23.360]  get injected with viruses, if they go to your brain, they cause vaccine-induced encephalitis.
[2:57:23.360 --> 2:57:28.440]  And depending on what part of the brain is damaged will determine what symptoms you have.
[2:57:28.440 --> 2:57:33.320]  The parts of the brain that control behavior and make you violent are primarily the limbic
[2:57:33.320 --> 2:57:39.280]  system, especially the amygdala, which is near the ear. By the way, Dr. Russell Blalock,
[2:57:39.280 --> 2:57:43.000]  who is a top brain surgeon, even invented some famous brain procedures, one of the
[2:57:43.000 --> 2:57:50.440]  top guys in the world. He discovered all this in his practice. Okay, how vaccines literally
[2:57:50.440 --> 2:57:55.200]  attack the brain. Go ahead. Yes, exactly. This has been known for years. But the point
[2:57:55.200 --> 2:57:59.440]  I want to make is that the scientists are actually researching how to make people violent.
[2:57:59.440 --> 2:58:03.680]  This is something that they want to have happen. I encourage all the listeners to watch the
[2:58:03.680 --> 2:58:09.440]  movie recently released on DVD entitled Quarantine, which actually shows them experimenting with
[2:58:09.440 --> 2:58:14.720]  rabies and making the people become basically ghouls. So this is more evil than you can
[2:58:14.720 --> 2:58:21.200]  even imagine. Absolutely. Stay there. Back in 70 seconds. Dr. Rebecca Carly, give out
[2:58:21.200 --> 2:58:24.520]  your website and a lot more, and then I'm just going to try to control myself. I just
[2:58:24.520 --> 2:58:27.360]  want to back up everything you're saying, because I know it's true. Then let's just
[2:58:27.360 --> 2:58:32.600]  walk through the vaccine history, what we're dealing with, how devastating this bird flu
[2:58:32.600 --> 2:58:36.440]  situation being where they're trying to mix it with vaccines could have been over in
[2:58:36.440 --> 2:58:43.320]  Europe and 18 nations. Stay with us. We'll be right back. Thank you for listening to

[3:00:42.360 --> 3:00:46.960]  info packed in as you can because I know it's just incredible knowledge you have and first
[3:00:46.960 --> 3:00:50.840]  off, fire out your website for folks that want to see all this footnoted and documented.
[3:00:50.840 --> 3:00:59.240]  Thank you so much. Yes, it's the triple W is Dr. Carly.com. That's D-R-C-A-R-L-E-Y.com.
[3:00:59.240 --> 3:01:04.360]  I encourage the listeners to sign up for the updates on my site. I send out important information
[3:01:04.360 --> 3:01:09.760]  on a regular basis. There's so much information there, but my paper, Inoculations of True
[3:01:09.760 --> 3:01:14.600]  Weapons of Mass Destruction explains how the vaccines corrupt the immune system because
[3:01:14.600 --> 3:01:19.440]  the very important points people need to know. It's not just the infections that they're
[3:01:19.440 --> 3:01:24.560]  causing. The injection of the viruses directly into your bloodstream bypassing the upper
[3:01:24.560 --> 3:01:30.800]  respiratory and GI tract actually causes your immune system to turn on yourself. So therefore,
[3:01:30.800 --> 3:01:37.400]  all autoimmune diseases, non-traumatic seizures, cancer and genetic damage is caused by vaccines.
[3:01:37.400 --> 3:01:43.120]  And this is proven in a recent article on my site entitled, The Science of Vaccine Damage,
[3:01:43.120 --> 3:01:49.720]  which is research done by non-pharma-funded veterinarians that have proven that the vaccines,
[3:01:49.720 --> 3:01:54.000]  once they create antibodies, can attack any part of your body. So this is the biggest
[3:01:54.000 --> 3:01:59.120]  epidemic the world has ever known, vaccine-induced diseases. I also encourage the listeners
[3:01:59.120 --> 3:02:05.160]  to read my response to the CDC's Public Health Protection Guide because in that document,
[3:02:05.160 --> 3:02:11.320]  I actually document how, in my own medical books, you see, Alex, I'm sure you know,
[3:02:11.320 --> 3:02:16.280]  the medical doctors are totally sleep-deprived, brainwashed and nutritionally-deprived. You
[3:02:16.280 --> 3:02:20.760]  go in there like a zombie and you just regurgitate out what they tell you. You don't actually
[3:02:20.760 --> 3:02:25.880]  let it into your consciousness and critically evaluate it. But in my book Harrison's Principles
[3:02:25.880 --> 3:02:32.000]  of Internal Medicine, the sixth edition on page 943, I actually found the following quote,
[3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:37.280]  rarely is prevention of infection considered to be an important goal of vaccination. In
[3:02:37.280 --> 3:02:43.240]  fact, asymptomatic infections can serve to enhance and prolong the immune response. What
[3:02:43.240 --> 3:02:47.680]  that means is that once they're injected directly into your bloodstream, you're not
[3:02:47.680 --> 3:02:52.960]  able to push these viruses out. They remain in your body. They mutate. They cause all
[3:02:52.960 --> 3:02:58.240]  kinds of havoc. They recombine with other viruses. And that brings us into the Baxter
[3:02:58.240 --> 3:03:05.440]  situation where this company released the flu vaccine that was mysteriously contaminated
[3:03:05.440 --> 3:03:11.120]  with the H5N1 bird flu virus. And I want to just mention that the smoking gun in this
[3:03:11.120 --> 3:03:16.280]  case was contained in an article written by Helen Branswell of the Canadian press on
[3:03:16.280 --> 3:03:23.480]  February 27th, where she actually states that this company, Baxter, where they had this
[3:03:23.480 --> 3:03:30.160]  experimental virus material made at the Orthodontal Research Facility, they not only make the
[3:03:30.160 --> 3:03:34.880]  flu vaccine, but they also make the bird flu vaccine. And they're expecting their
[3:03:34.880 --> 3:03:40.600]  license shortly. So isn't it amazing, Alex, that they released this to 18 countries and
[3:03:40.600 --> 3:03:46.640]  they've got a vaccine for bird flu just waiting to be sold? So this is obviously what their
[3:03:46.640 --> 3:03:51.440]  intention was to open this Pandora's box, and then they would step forward with the
[3:03:51.440 --> 3:03:52.600]  alleged cure.
[3:03:52.600 --> 3:03:59.040]  Well, you know, even the Czech Republic newspapers, mainstream ones were saying, this looks like
[3:03:59.040 --> 3:04:02.560]  it could be staged and saying what you just said.
[3:04:02.560 --> 3:04:08.920]  There's no other explanation for it. And I want to also ask the listeners to consider
[3:04:08.920 --> 3:04:14.080]  what is the difference between this and what happened with the anthrax mailings? There's
[3:04:14.080 --> 3:04:19.160]  no way this can't be intentional because they have this, as I said, smoking gun where they
[3:04:19.160 --> 3:04:25.440]  are making a vaccine that they will sell once the bird flu is unleashed. So we had the situation
[3:04:25.440 --> 3:04:30.400]  where they sent anthrax and mailings, which they've sent bird flu and mailings. We called
[3:04:30.400 --> 3:04:36.800]  this a crime. And why isn't that a crime? These people should be persecuted and prosecuted
[3:04:36.800 --> 3:04:40.840]  and put in jail for unleashing this on the public. And we still don't know what's going
[3:04:40.840 --> 3:04:44.560]  to happen. I think we're going to start hearing about bird flu very soon.
[3:04:44.560 --> 3:04:47.320]  Stay there. Let's talk about that when we get back. Yeah, for those that don't know,
[3:04:47.320 --> 3:04:50.760]  the White House was on Cifro, the anthrax fighting antibiotic in the hell in the stock
[3:04:50.760 --> 3:04:54.560]  on September 10th, and that was admitted in the Associated Press. Our flasher admitted
[3:04:54.560 --> 3:04:59.160]  the whole White House knew because they launched the attack. They have secret death squads
[3:04:59.160 --> 3:05:01.800]  and wanted to be dictators, but they wouldn't launch the anthrax just to government strength.
[3:05:01.800 --> 3:05:06.040]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent? How about chlorides,
[3:05:06.040 --> 3:05:12.240]  dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes and more? Even fragrance can indicate the presence
[3:05:12.240 --> 3:05:17.480]  of some 4000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic. Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[3:05:17.480 --> 3:05:21.200]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to
[3:05:21.200 --> 3:05:25.680]  coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin and

[3:06:03.880 --> 3:06:10.040]  humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to have a civilian national security
[3:06:10.040 --> 3:06:17.360]  force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded. The Obama deception completely
[3:06:17.360 --> 3:06:22.040]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[3:06:22.040 --> 3:06:26.720]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election. If you have
[3:06:26.720 --> 3:06:31.720]  a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the
[3:06:31.720 --> 3:06:38.280]  program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not
[3:06:38.280 --> 3:06:43.440]  about left or right, it's about a one-world government. This film documents who Obama
[3:06:43.440 --> 3:06:50.240]  works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception

[3:06:57.200 --> 3:07:02.080]  deception, the people strike back.
[3:07:02.080 --> 3:07:07.800]  Hi this is Steve Shank. Our government has handed over billions with no strings attached
[3:07:07.800 --> 3:07:12.960]  and no accountability to the very bankers who created this whole mess we're in. Millions
[3:07:12.960 --> 3:07:18.840]  have lost their jobs to corporate corruption and mismanagement. Trillions in savings,
[3:07:18.840 --> 3:07:24.120]  net worth and retirement accounts, have been lost by investors and homeowners. When you
[3:07:24.120 --> 3:07:29.760]  really look at all the theft, crimes, secret organizations, and pervasive corruption going
[3:07:29.760 --> 3:07:36.040]  on, it's enough to make you think of your second favorite F word, food. Food, the F
[3:07:36.040 --> 3:07:45.040]  word that we had all better be thinking about. Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[3:07:45.040 --> 3:07:57.360]  800-409-5633. By the way, I assume your first favorite F word is faith. Call 800-409-5633
[3:07:57.360 --> 3:08:11.160]  on the web efoodsdirect.com. Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You
[3:08:11.160 --> 3:08:19.880]  want answers? Well so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from
[3:08:19.880 --> 3:08:28.280]  Austin, Texas. Alex Jones. I am Alex Jones. I am your host and we honor here live. By
[3:08:28.280 --> 3:08:31.760]  the way, I've been told I'm on local PBS in Austin this weekend. They're going to
[3:08:31.760 --> 3:08:36.360]  interview me live. Russian TV is coming here to interview me again. It's some more foreign
[3:08:36.360 --> 3:08:39.880]  media and I'm just putting it out here just in our own little corner of the world in
[3:08:39.880 --> 3:08:46.080]  a fight against the globalist. It is just popping and moving and people are really waking
[3:08:46.080 --> 3:08:50.720]  up and listening as we did the groundwork. We woke people up, we warned them, we explained
[3:08:50.720 --> 3:08:53.680]  what was going to happen from the globalist own documents, their own battle plans. It's
[3:08:53.680 --> 3:08:58.800]  happening but not without huge resistance and if you look at the resistance curve, it
[3:08:58.800 --> 3:09:03.840]  is massive. The state's revolting, everything happening. That's why I believe the enemy
[3:09:03.840 --> 3:09:12.280]  is going to stage terror attacks and mass shootings and a lot of other things and start
[3:09:12.280 --> 3:09:16.320]  new wars as a rank corporation said they want to do. They tell us what they're going to
[3:09:16.320 --> 3:09:20.560]  do. It's not like I'm predicting it. Read in the TV guide and false flag is I don't
[3:09:20.560 --> 3:09:24.920]  think on the horizon, I think it's here with us now. I think they've got their finger on
[3:09:24.920 --> 3:09:31.320]  the button and it shows just push the button. For me, I'm in here, just one button I push.
[3:09:31.320 --> 3:09:35.280]  The New World Order is a lot more nasty secret of globalist than Dick Cheney running around
[3:09:35.280 --> 3:09:41.960]  with secret hit squads than the rest of it like we covered last hour. It's just so important
[3:09:41.960 --> 3:09:45.360]  what we're dealing with. You know, Dr. Rebecca Carly, when you were on with me briefly for
[3:09:45.360 --> 3:09:48.920]  30 minutes last week, you said, oh, what about this article with all the homeless dying from
[3:09:48.920 --> 3:09:53.720]  shots in Europe for bird flu and it kills them and investigations and what about this
[3:09:53.720 --> 3:09:56.920]  and that? I was pulling up everything you were saying. It was all mainstream news. I
[3:09:56.920 --> 3:10:00.760]  hadn't seen it. I didn't know and they keep hyping bird flu, bird flu. It's going to
[3:10:00.760 --> 3:10:04.280]  get you. Millions will die, bird flu, bird flu. Give up all your rights, bird flu, bird
[3:10:04.280 --> 3:10:07.880]  flu. What do you see happening here? Please continue.
[3:10:07.880 --> 3:10:12.960]  Well, as I said, I think the horse is already out of the barn. All of these people that
[3:10:12.960 --> 3:10:18.280]  were exposed to this mailing from Baxter have already been exposed to the bird flu and we
[3:10:18.280 --> 3:10:22.400]  don't know how many people are incubating it right now as we speak and are going to
[3:10:22.400 --> 3:10:27.520]  end up coming out with the bird flu and it's truly chilling. Let's see.
[3:10:27.520 --> 3:10:32.080]  Let me stop you. I mean, that's quite an announcement, but people are already dying
[3:10:32.080 --> 3:10:35.800]  in cases all over the world and the one in Telegraph and other places they'll never say
[3:10:35.800 --> 3:10:43.240]  it'll say authorities in Poland with the 23 dead from the 360 given it at one homeless
[3:10:43.240 --> 3:10:48.120]  clinic. A homeless clinic says they were misled by pharmacological companies that it was regular
[3:10:48.120 --> 3:10:52.760]  flu vaccine, but they were paid to tell the homeless that it was just regular and then
[3:10:52.760 --> 3:10:59.760]  it killed them and people are dying and then they also are reporting on this HPV live cancer
[3:10:59.760 --> 3:11:04.480]  virus saying it could mutate and they're admitting on CBS News it's killing people and so the
[3:11:04.480 --> 3:11:09.240]  people are dying, but I wanted to ask you, do you know what companies, because it won't,
[3:11:09.240 --> 3:11:13.680]  it doesn't say in the mainstream news, what companies it is that are, that the shots are
[3:11:13.680 --> 3:11:16.040]  killing people in these tests in Europe?
[3:11:16.040 --> 3:11:21.200]  Well I think all the companies that are making the bird flu vaccine are actually testing
[3:11:21.200 --> 3:11:26.880]  people to see if it does kill them. I think that was the intention for them to test this
[3:11:26.880 --> 3:11:31.280]  vaccine in the homeless people and by the way, yes, it's in the mainstream media in
[3:11:31.280 --> 3:11:36.920]  the UK, telegraph.co.uk, certainly not in this country, but I think they're doing these
[3:11:36.920 --> 3:11:42.160]  tests to specifically see how well the vaccine is working. That is the intention for them
[3:11:42.160 --> 3:11:48.240]  to kill people. As a matter of fact, on March 4th of 2009, let's remember that the Baxter
[3:11:48.240 --> 3:11:54.880]  release was reported on February 27th, so this is like a week later. They had a conference,
[3:11:54.880 --> 3:12:01.840]  an emergency management summit agenda that took place in, I believe it was Colorado,
[3:12:01.840 --> 3:12:08.120]  yes, and this is what one of their minions, a PJ Havas cover, mental health professional
[3:12:08.120 --> 3:12:14.240]  and program coordinator stated, that community memorial services are very important when
[3:12:14.240 --> 3:12:19.240]  you're talking to people, voice your appreciation for those in quarantine, talk about how they're
[3:12:19.240 --> 3:12:24.560]  hometown heroes and doing what they need to be doing in order to protect the community.
[3:12:24.560 --> 3:12:29.160]  So they're already telling people, get ready for quarantine, so obviously the people within
[3:12:29.160 --> 3:12:33.680]  the government, FEMA type of organizations already know what's coming.
[3:12:33.680 --> 3:12:37.320]  My God, and what is the source of that bombshell you just dropped?
[3:12:37.320 --> 3:12:42.480]  Citizens for legitimate government, www.legitgov.org.
[3:12:42.480 --> 3:12:48.160]  No, I know who they are. They're saying they were at the meeting and are reporting this.
[3:12:48.160 --> 3:12:52.240]  Yes, that's what they're reporting this in this article that I have.
[3:12:52.240 --> 3:12:59.440]  Well, I know we've had reported here that emergency managers in Illinois and Indiana
[3:12:59.440 --> 3:13:03.240]  are being told, get ready for mass graves, get ready for mass death, bird flu. That was
[3:13:03.240 --> 3:13:08.720]  just three weeks ago. I'd forgotten about that big report that we covered here on air.
[3:13:08.720 --> 3:13:11.880]  And we know they're constantly hyping this, but they tried to claim smallpox was about
[3:13:11.880 --> 3:13:17.280]  to be released in 2002, tried to make the police take it, they refused. So my issue
[3:13:17.280 --> 3:13:23.200]  here is that when you pull back from all of this, and you know that there's been tens
[3:13:23.200 --> 3:13:29.080]  of thousands of declassified chemical, biological, radiological, lethal tests, not just syphilis
[3:13:29.080 --> 3:13:32.680]  and Tuskegee that everybody knows about, but biologicals in the New York subways, death
[3:13:32.680 --> 3:13:38.840]  results, the details remain classified. That's mainstream Reuters, AP, you know, spraying
[3:13:38.840 --> 3:13:42.520]  the ship channel in San Francisco killing people, plague bombs released in Scotland
[3:13:42.520 --> 3:13:46.280]  killing people, headlines, every square inch of England's been sprayed with chemical,
[3:13:46.280 --> 3:13:49.840]  biological, radiological, London Guardian. It's all in the end game. When you know they
[3:13:49.840 --> 3:13:54.760]  took U.S. troops, radiated into death, gave them biological weapons, injected them with
[3:13:54.760 --> 3:13:58.960]  sarin and VX nerve gas to kill them. And then told their family they died in a car wreck
[3:13:58.960 --> 3:14:03.600]  or died of flu. This, and we know they brought the Nazis over here because the Nazis got
[3:14:03.600 --> 3:14:06.840]  the idea from us. So the scientists then wanted them after World War II and brought
[3:14:06.840 --> 3:14:11.320]  them here to not just, you know, head up NASA, but head up the CIA, everything else that's
[3:14:11.320 --> 3:14:15.760]  declassified tens of thousands of Nazis. This is eugenics. You got top professors running
[3:14:15.760 --> 3:14:20.160]  around in biology department saying soon it'll all be airborne. 90% of you will die, including
[3:14:20.160 --> 3:14:24.440]  my family. Oh, it's so wonderful. You know, like 13 monkeys. The point is, is that these
[3:14:24.440 --> 3:14:28.240]  psychos have done this over and over again. And now they're messing with stuff that could
[3:14:28.240 --> 3:14:29.880]  release the mega plague.
[3:14:29.880 --> 3:14:36.280]  Well, exactly. And this is all being done intentionally under Title 50, the U.S. Code.
[3:14:36.280 --> 3:14:42.000]  Go to, go to your local library folks, look up title, a U.S. Code Title 50, Chapter 32,
[3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:47.800]  Subsection 15, 20, 15, 24, where the Department of Defense can use human subjects for testing
[3:14:47.800 --> 3:14:48.800]  of chemical.
[3:14:48.800 --> 3:14:51.880]  And by the way, people don't know how to read that. They pull up U.S. Code Title 50,
[3:14:51.880 --> 3:14:59.000]  Chapter, U.S. Code Title 50, Chapter 32, yeah, subsection 1528 paragraph B, correct?
[3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:00.000]  Right.
[3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:04.800]  Okay. I've got to get in the brain focus to bring that up in there. It says you're not
[3:15:04.800 --> 3:15:09.920]  allowed to do without consent unless it's for government testing and then list other
[3:15:09.920 --> 3:15:13.800]  things and people read it and say it says they can't do it, except for whenever they
[3:15:13.800 --> 3:15:14.800]  want.
[3:15:14.800 --> 3:15:19.720]  Well, actually, it's very funny because the initial one was written in the 1960s. And
[3:15:19.720 --> 3:15:24.480]  I actually learned about this on C-SPAN, a caller called in, and of course, C-SPAN has
[3:15:24.480 --> 3:15:29.760]  millions of listeners. And so in April of 2000, they repealed it. But just like they
[3:15:29.760 --> 3:15:34.800]  always do, what they did is not only loophole it back in, but actually add things. They
[3:15:34.800 --> 3:15:40.200]  said there's restrictions on the use of human subjects for testing of chemical or biological
[3:15:40.200 --> 3:15:41.200]  agents.
[3:15:41.200 --> 3:15:47.880]  Here are the exceptions. Any peaceful purpose related to a medical, pharmaceutical, agricultural,
[3:15:47.880 --> 3:15:53.440]  industrial research activity, any purpose directly related to protection against toxic
[3:15:53.440 --> 3:15:59.840]  chemicals or biological weapons, or any law enforcement purpose, including riot control.
[3:15:59.840 --> 3:16:04.280]  So they loophole everything back in and then added the riot control aspect on there.
[3:16:04.280 --> 3:16:09.040]  That's right. And then just like folks call up and say, oh, this isn't real from the
[3:16:09.040 --> 3:16:13.080]  state police. You can just call them and they admit it and we have, it's not real. And
[3:16:13.080 --> 3:16:17.360]  all that US code is not real. And the Patriot Act doesn't say that all misdemeanors are
[3:16:17.360 --> 3:16:20.200]  terrorism and have top lawyers on it and they admit it on there.
[3:16:20.200 --> 3:16:25.160]  Yes. And I also just want to remind the listeners, and this is something that you might want
[3:16:25.160 --> 3:16:30.840]  to consider putting in your Obama Deception 1.5 in regards to what's happening with the
[3:16:30.840 --> 3:16:38.400]  economic stimulus package in terms of extra money. Now we have $954 million that's going
[3:16:38.400 --> 3:16:43.800]  to be used as an additional amount to carry out the immunization program authorized by
[3:16:43.800 --> 3:16:52.680]  section 317 AJK and K1 of the Public Health Surface Act. So not only are they going to
[3:16:52.680 --> 3:16:58.080]  be spending almost a billion dollars for more vaccines, but they've also allocated over
[3:16:58.080 --> 3:17:03.800]  half a billion dollars to carry out chronic disease health promotion and genomics programs.
[3:17:03.800 --> 3:17:10.880]  So they're actually playing with our very DNA structure. This is my idea of the true
[3:17:10.880 --> 3:17:14.320]  mark of the beast that they're going to be injecting us with things that's going to alter
[3:17:14.320 --> 3:17:18.560]  our very genetic structure. And this could cause the extinction of the human race. This
[3:17:18.560 --> 3:17:19.560]  is no joke.
[3:17:19.560 --> 3:17:24.080]  By the way, a lot of top scientists and headlines have admitted that that Mercury itself alters
[3:17:24.080 --> 3:17:28.920]  DNA permanently, even mitochondrial passed on by the mother, and that all of these things
[3:17:28.920 --> 3:17:33.200]  are actually downgrading and destroying our DNA. And now they've got this whole new level
[3:17:33.200 --> 3:17:38.920]  of that they call vaccines that are really genetic engineering mutagens where they say,
[3:17:38.920 --> 3:17:42.360]  oh, you'll take a shot and you'll never be able to get high off cocaine again. But then
[3:17:42.360 --> 3:17:45.200]  they admit in the literature, but you won't be able to have your regular endorphins and
[3:17:45.200 --> 3:17:50.120]  be happy. And the viruses go in and eat certain areas of the brain. And I tell people that
[3:17:50.120 --> 3:17:55.160]  and they just don't understand. Can you talk about those class of live biological agent
[3:17:55.160 --> 3:17:58.240]  vaccines that redesign organs?
[3:17:58.240 --> 3:18:05.840]  Yes. Well, first of all, let me say that every single thing that's in a vaccine, every single
[3:18:05.840 --> 3:18:11.080]  product, like you said, the Mercury, the formaldehyde, every single thing that's in the vaccine
[3:18:11.080 --> 3:18:16.920]  does its own damage. In fact, I had talked to somebody on my internet radio show who
[3:18:16.920 --> 3:18:25.000]  had worked in the Air Force or something to do with airplanes. And he reported that you're
[3:18:25.000 --> 3:18:29.720]  not even allowed to bring Mercury on an airplane because the reaction that we'll have with
[3:18:29.720 --> 3:18:35.360]  aluminum is so violent that it can burn holes in an aluminum plane. So people could ask
[3:18:35.360 --> 3:18:40.400]  themselves, why are they putting Mercury and aluminum together and injecting it directly
[3:18:40.400 --> 3:18:45.160]  into your bloodstream? As a matter of fact, I have another NATO book entitled, Immunological
[3:18:45.160 --> 3:18:51.080]  Adjuvants in Vaccines. In this book, which was published in 1989, they actually admit
[3:18:51.080 --> 3:18:57.560]  that it's the aluminum in vaccines that causes the production of IgE, which is the antibody
[3:18:57.560 --> 3:19:03.720]  of allergy. So they have known all these years that all of the allergies being produced,
[3:19:03.720 --> 3:19:09.160]  including the life-threatening and oftentimes fatal anaphylactic reactions from peanuts.
[3:19:09.160 --> 3:19:13.280]  You have little children in school sitting next to a child that's eating a peanut butter
[3:19:13.280 --> 3:19:16.960]  sandwich and just smelling that peanut butter can kill them.
[3:19:16.960 --> 3:19:22.480]  Yeah, nobody was allergic to it 50 years ago. Now it's just now almost every food people
[3:19:22.480 --> 3:19:23.480]  can eat it.
[3:19:23.480 --> 3:19:24.480]  Exactly. And not only that.
[3:19:24.480 --> 3:19:29.040]  Oh, by the way, even if you don't take the vaccines, other kids are leaching it out onto
[3:19:29.040 --> 3:19:30.040]  your kids.
[3:19:30.040 --> 3:19:35.520]  Oh, yes. As a matter of fact, most of these outbreaks of measles and such that the media
[3:19:35.520 --> 3:19:39.920]  is using is a hype to scare people to get vaccinated. When you read between the lines,
[3:19:39.920 --> 3:19:45.200]  you find out that almost all those children got the measles vaccine.
[3:19:45.200 --> 3:19:48.440]  Well, they know with all everybody that has Crohn's disease that didn't exist until 50
[3:19:48.440 --> 3:19:52.840]  years ago with vaccines, they find the antibodies from different vaccines they've been given
[3:19:52.840 --> 3:19:57.720]  in their guts, causing an autoimmune disturbance where the people then basically have to have
[3:19:57.720 --> 3:20:02.040]  their intestines cut out. But it's enjoyable. You know, government loves you.
[3:20:02.040 --> 3:20:06.080]  Rough roads might be ahead for the economy, but your vehicle doesn't have to experience

[3:21:05.520 --> 3:21:10.800]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind
[3:21:10.800 --> 3:21:16.280]  of world order that I think all of us would like to see. The Obama deception completely
[3:21:16.280 --> 3:21:20.840]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[3:21:20.840 --> 3:21:25.520]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election. If you have
[3:21:25.520 --> 3:21:30.480]  a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the
[3:21:30.480 --> 3:21:38.440]  program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:21:38.440 --> 3:21:43.160]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents
[3:21:43.160 --> 3:21:49.760]  who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the

[3:21:57.120 --> 3:22:01.320]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[3:22:01.320 --> 3:22:26.000]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11,110, was signed
[3:22:26.000 --> 3:22:30.240]  with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United
[3:22:30.240 --> 3:22:34.200]  States government in interest. With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out
[3:22:34.200 --> 3:22:38.640]  of business. The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency. However,
[3:22:38.640 --> 3:22:44.240]  the Executive Order still stands unrepealed. Midas has the Kennedy v. Fed document. Call

[3:24:05.920 --> 3:24:10.480]  You know, the full magnitude of all this just slammed me like a ton of bricks here in the
[3:24:10.480 --> 3:24:15.760]  break. Just boom! That happens, you know, a couple times a week when it's just the full
[3:24:15.760 --> 3:24:23.120]  magnitude. Even though I constantly study this, it just punches me like a freight train. Bam!
[3:24:23.120 --> 3:24:29.600]  And I realize psychopathic eugenics elites are in control of the planet, putting sodium
[3:24:29.600 --> 3:24:34.880]  fluoride in the water and hundreds of other toxins and poisons. Genetic engineering spraying.
[3:24:34.880 --> 3:24:39.920]  Genetic engineered food that kills the rats and getting pigs they test on. Mutations that
[3:24:39.920 --> 3:24:47.160]  only supposed to happen embryonically happen after birth. Mass illnesses, children sick,
[3:24:47.160 --> 3:24:52.680]  cancer exploding at every level, SWAT teams, FEMA camps, demonization of patriots, world
[3:24:52.680 --> 3:24:56.480]  government rising, openly saying once they have the world government in place they're
[3:24:56.480 --> 3:25:00.840]  going to start killing billions at a time, mass wipeouts. We were right about the whole
[3:25:00.840 --> 3:25:05.160]  setup of this. Do you want to wait and have the rest happen? I don't know if we can stop
[3:25:05.160 --> 3:25:10.480]  it. God help us. And they could launch this any day. We're going to happen five years
[3:25:10.480 --> 3:25:14.160]  from now. You know, the big kill, not just the soft kill build up as they're testing
[3:25:14.160 --> 3:25:18.160]  all of this. Dr. Rebecca Carly, I want to come back and start taking calls for you.
[3:25:18.160 --> 3:25:21.920]  But give out your website again for folks and please continue with the analysis you
[3:25:21.920 --> 3:25:28.760]  were breaking down. Okay, it's www.drcarly.com and I totally agree with you what you were
[3:25:28.760 --> 3:25:33.240]  saying in your previous segment, Alex. The good news is people are waking up big time.
[3:25:33.240 --> 3:25:37.560]  They realize that they are dead meat if they don't rise up. But I just want to finish the
[3:25:37.560 --> 3:25:41.840]  thought that you were talking about about the autoimmune aspect because this is so huge,
[3:25:41.840 --> 3:25:47.600]  folks. It's not just the viruses. They are culturing these viruses on different tissues.
[3:25:47.600 --> 3:25:52.040]  More and more now they're using aborted fetus cells. So if you're injected with an aborted
[3:25:52.040 --> 3:25:57.360]  fetus's nervous system tissue, you will develop antibodies against that nervous system and
[3:25:57.360 --> 3:26:02.760]  those antibodies will attack you. If you develop it, if you get a piece of their gut and that's
[3:26:02.760 --> 3:26:07.440]  injected into you, you develop antibodies against the gut. Let me stop you. I've got to stop
[3:26:07.440 --> 3:26:13.680]  you. Everything you're seeing is true because Europe has been using dead babies. Dead babies
[3:26:13.680 --> 3:26:20.360]  grind them up to mix them and they have stem cells all in them, which allows wild mutations.
[3:26:20.360 --> 3:26:25.840]  There are genetic viruses encoded in the DNA. That's being given super-rise. Again, all
[3:26:25.840 --> 3:26:30.080]  this they know will cause these mass plagues and now when you hear stem cell, they, oh,
[3:26:30.080 --> 3:26:35.800]  it's just a stem cell. No, it means dead babies. Dead babies is what they call stem cells,
[3:26:35.800 --> 3:26:41.160]  not just the small embryos. That's the seed of a baby, the baby, the big baby. Go ahead.
[3:26:41.160 --> 3:26:47.520]  Yes, but my point is, is that you're developing antibodies against those babies, a DNA or a
[3:26:47.520 --> 3:26:50.640]  monkey kidney or whatever else they're using to culture the virus.
[3:26:50.640 --> 3:26:55.560]  Let me stop you again. 200 million Americans vaccinated at least in the first round of it
[3:26:55.560 --> 3:27:00.040]  with the Simeon virus 40 that they admittedly gives people cancer. Government admits it.
[3:27:00.040 --> 3:27:04.880]  And that was just from monkey kidneys. Think about what happens with human and pig tissue.
[3:27:04.880 --> 3:27:05.880]  Go ahead.
[3:27:05.880 --> 3:27:10.360]  Exactly. And that's what people have to realize. And I just want to say the good news is that
[3:27:10.360 --> 3:27:15.760]  I have developed a protocol that reverses these autoimmune diseases, seizures, and cancer
[3:27:15.760 --> 3:27:20.880]  with natural therapies. And you can learn about that on my website. And let me just say if
[3:27:20.880 --> 3:27:25.320]  you're interested in finding out about it, please call me. Do not email me. I must say
[3:27:25.320 --> 3:27:29.400]  since I was on your show last week, my email is out of control. So if you want to reach
[3:27:29.400 --> 3:27:33.640]  me, you need to call me. But that's the good news, folks. But you have to understand that
[3:27:33.640 --> 3:27:38.880]  this is certainly their agenda. And I also have a YouTube video up now. I got into C-SPAN
[3:27:38.880 --> 3:27:43.880]  last Saturday. They were asking callers if they are for the stem cell research. And of
[3:27:43.880 --> 3:27:48.280]  course, I called in to ask, first of all, if the government is interested in our health,
[3:27:48.280 --> 3:27:52.840]  why are they trying to take away our supplements by codex? And more importantly, why are they
[3:27:52.840 --> 3:27:55.480]  creating disease with vaccinations?
[3:27:55.480 --> 3:28:00.840]  Now to mention the fact is the government is now going to be telling us what treatment
[3:28:00.840 --> 3:28:06.120]  we're allowed to get under their socialized medicine. Do any of you think that if a stem
[3:28:06.120 --> 3:28:11.560]  cell study was able to reverse paralysis, say, that your average Joe is going to have
[3:28:11.560 --> 3:28:13.440]  access to that? Of course not.
[3:28:13.440 --> 3:28:17.760]  Well, I mean, as you know, doctor, they've already come out with just many different
[3:28:17.760 --> 3:28:22.840]  cells, the skin cells, breast cells, all these other cells that work just as good or better,
[3:28:22.840 --> 3:28:29.360]  they don't have the mutagen qualities of the hyperactive fetal stem cells, but they
[3:28:29.360 --> 3:28:35.040]  don't care. Don't you want a cured disease? All they do is shell all the real treatments.
[3:28:35.040 --> 3:28:40.400]  Of course, they're creating disease. Vaccine-induced diseases is the biggest epidemic the world
[3:28:40.400 --> 3:28:45.120]  has ever known. It's not just in people. It's in pets. And Alex, I'm sure you're probably
[3:28:45.120 --> 3:28:50.080]  also aware, they're vaccinating every food source animal you can imagine. I used to say
[3:28:50.080 --> 3:28:55.600]  as a joke when I would give my lectures, if you had a sick fish and it was in a fish bowl
[3:28:55.600 --> 3:28:59.160]  that was dirty, would you vaccinate the fish or would you clean the water? Well, guess
[3:28:59.160 --> 3:29:04.280]  what, Alex? They're now vaccinating farm-raised fish. They're vaccinating everything you're
[3:29:04.280 --> 3:29:09.560]  putting into your mouth. If you're a chicken wing fan, fan folks, guess what? That's where
[3:29:09.560 --> 3:29:12.680]  they're injecting the vaccines into the chicken is in their wings.
[3:29:12.680 --> 3:29:18.760]  And let me expand. I meant to get to this two weeks ago when it first broke. Major university
[3:29:18.760 --> 3:29:22.160]  studies with the veterinarians. Oh, let's talk about when we come back because I know
[3:29:22.160 --> 3:29:25.680]  you know about that. We didn't have time to cover that last week. They're finding massive
[3:29:25.680 --> 3:29:31.240]  increases of cancer in the injection site on dogs and cats. And everybody I know that
[3:29:31.240 --> 3:29:36.000]  won't listen to me. Those who vaccinate their dog and it has seizures or their cat dies.
[3:29:36.000 --> 3:29:40.360]  This didn't used to happen. What's in the vaccines for dogs and cats that's killing
[3:29:40.360 --> 3:29:43.320]  them and hurting them? I know I'm all over the map here interrupting
[3:29:43.320 --> 3:29:47.360]  her. Everything she's saying is totally documented. We're totally screwed. I don't know what
[3:29:47.360 --> 3:29:51.920]  we're going to do. But the real threat according to the police is Ron Paul. So, yeah.
[3:29:51.920 --> 3:30:02.240]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:30:02.240 --> 3:30:05.840]  Everyone knows that omega three should be an essential part of our daily diet with so
[3:30:05.840 --> 3:30:09.680]  many different methods of consumption. How do you choose a simple, yet effective way
[3:30:09.680 --> 3:30:14.800]  to get your daily intake? The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American nutrition have the
[3:30:14.800 --> 3:30:20.240]  answer. Nature's Gem, premium omega three. Unlike other flax seed, our golden flax is
[3:30:20.240 --> 3:30:25.440]  grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures and longer summer hours

[3:31:07.520 --> 3:31:14.400]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[3:31:14.400 --> 3:31:18.280]  just as well funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the
[3:31:18.280 --> 3:31:23.440]  myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people. While Obama's already
[3:31:23.440 --> 3:31:29.040]  fudging, fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass
[3:31:29.040 --> 3:31:35.480]  movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and
[3:31:35.480 --> 3:31:40.280]  finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about
[3:31:40.280 --> 3:31:46.920]  a one world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told,

[3:32:02.080 --> 3:32:06.200]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water. And did you know that
[3:32:06.200 --> 3:32:10.200]  you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking
[3:32:10.200 --> 3:32:14.400]  the water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are
[3:32:14.400 --> 3:32:18.480]  absorbed into the skin. The KDF dual media shower filter works with
[3:32:18.480 --> 3:32:23.520]  both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron.
[3:32:23.520 --> 3:32:29.080]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus. The KDF dual media shower
[3:32:29.080 --> 3:32:34.600]  filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first. Hospitals, restaurants,
[3:32:34.600 --> 3:32:38.640]  and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and

[3:33:22.200 --> 3:33:25.600]  Folks, I want you to understand something. I believe everything I've said here and I've
[3:33:25.600 --> 3:33:30.240]  researched it and documented it for myself and I'm not a medical doctor like Dr. Carly.
[3:33:30.240 --> 3:33:35.200]  But I've had countless medical doctors and virologists on here telling you the same
[3:33:35.200 --> 3:33:40.240]  thing. You know, they'll freak you out and yell and scream about some nut-killing to
[3:33:40.240 --> 3:33:44.200]  people when that's a tragedy, but there's vaccine deaths constantly. They'll have a
[3:33:44.200 --> 3:33:47.760]  debate about autism and mercury and that's a small part of it. It's the autoimmune
[3:33:47.760 --> 3:33:52.840]  swelling that's the main cause, according to all their own studies. You just never
[3:33:52.840 --> 3:33:57.000]  see it in the mainline news or you see a blurb about it, then you've got to go to the study
[3:33:57.000 --> 3:34:05.400]  itself. I am fighting as hard as I can and I am looking at farms an hour or two away.
[3:34:05.400 --> 3:34:09.320]  I'm going to do the TV show here, but it's getting so crazy and I can feel they're moving
[3:34:09.320 --> 3:34:14.880]  towards it. I say I feel all the analysis together and then the subconscious mind integrates
[3:34:14.880 --> 3:34:21.840]  that into an overlay of projection of the future as best we can. We all have that ability
[3:34:21.840 --> 3:34:27.680]  and the great brain God gave us, but my children are also most important to me. That's why
[3:34:27.680 --> 3:34:33.360]  I take the risk of the things I'm doing because the risk of doing nothing is much greater.
[3:34:33.360 --> 3:34:37.520]  And I know I would say it's totally safe to run to the hills because if we do that,
[3:34:37.520 --> 3:34:44.240]  they're all going to win, but people should have some out, some backup. My God, it's
[3:34:44.240 --> 3:34:48.560]  just so horrible. Dr. Carly, please continue with what's happening to the animals in the
[3:34:48.560 --> 3:34:55.000]  vaccines. Well, let me just also mention, yes, the children are our most valuable asset
[3:34:55.000 --> 3:34:59.560]  and that's why the medical mafia has actually taken my only child away from me. I have been
[3:34:59.560 --> 3:35:03.720]  persecuted more than any other medical doctor that speaks about vaccines because I go to
[3:35:03.720 --> 3:35:08.280]  the genocidal level and that's why I'm so honored that you're having me on your shelf.
[3:35:08.280 --> 3:35:13.920]  But yes, in fact, if you go to my website, DrCarly.com, within the article, Science of
[3:35:13.920 --> 3:35:20.680]  Vaccine Damage, a researcher, Gary Smith actually explains what cancer is. It's a wound that
[3:35:20.680 --> 3:35:27.320]  never heals because what happens is that the inflammation that occurs is actually not the
[3:35:27.320 --> 3:35:33.400]  body trying to fight the infection. It's the virus or bacteria deliberately causing inflammation
[3:35:33.400 --> 3:35:39.960]  to hide that virus and bacteria which can mutate and cause cancer from the immune system.
[3:35:39.960 --> 3:35:46.560]  And we also have the aluminum in the vaccine which mutates the P53 oncogene which is actually
[3:35:46.560 --> 3:35:51.920]  supposed to suppress the formation of tumors. So now you have the aluminum in there actually
[3:35:51.920 --> 3:35:57.200]  causing the tumors to go into hyperdrive. We have carcinogens like formaldehyde in vaccines
[3:35:57.200 --> 3:36:02.680]  that are actually cancer-causing agents and they're injecting that into people as well.
[3:36:02.680 --> 3:36:08.160]  And let's not forget to mention the special virus cancer project. I have multiple years
[3:36:08.160 --> 3:36:14.840]  of documents of this in my progress report number nine here before we published in 1982.
[3:36:14.840 --> 3:36:19.840]  They're actually doing research such as the Southwest Foundation for Research and Education,
[3:36:19.840 --> 3:36:25.400]  a branch of the NIH, studying latent virus infection and transmission. They're studying
[3:36:25.400 --> 3:36:31.640]  how to activate these viruses with pesticides and other things. I mean, it's just unbelievable
[3:36:31.640 --> 3:36:37.040]  when you read the documents just like the Nazis basically telling us what they're doing.
[3:36:37.040 --> 3:36:42.560]  We have another one by the Bionetics Research Laboratories, investigations of viral carcinogenesis
[3:36:42.560 --> 3:36:49.240]  in primates. They want to figure out what actually activates carcinogenesis. And as
[3:36:49.240 --> 3:36:53.400]  I explained in my paper, inoculations of true weapons of mass destruction, when you're
[3:36:53.400 --> 3:36:59.040]  injecting all these viruses into a person or a pet, of course, that's a total distraction
[3:36:59.040 --> 3:37:04.040]  for the immune system. The T-cells which I describe as the little pacman cells whose
[3:37:04.040 --> 3:37:09.880]  job it is is to go around and gobble up cancer cells, they're totally paralyzed because the
[3:37:09.880 --> 3:37:15.600]  B-cell arm is so busy creating antibodies. So there's many different factors involved
[3:37:15.600 --> 3:37:22.320]  in forming cancer. On my website, I actually have an MP3 file of a show I did on cancer
[3:37:22.320 --> 3:37:28.120]  which people can listen to that explains the various aspects. But this is so huge. And
[3:37:28.120 --> 3:37:35.320]  as we see cancer increasing and increasing, we have the Susan G. Coleman having people
[3:37:35.320 --> 3:37:41.160]  march around to raise millions of dollars for research to find a cure. How about if
[3:37:41.160 --> 3:37:45.720]  we get rid of the cause folks? How about if we stop these inoculations? Which are the
[3:37:45.720 --> 3:37:50.880]  true weapons of mass destruction? I know that they came and took your medical
[3:37:50.880 --> 3:37:56.040]  license. You fought them and got it back. So actually, I didn't fight them. What they
[3:37:56.040 --> 3:38:00.920]  wanted me to do, and let me just say, when I was a surgeon, I never had a single complaint
[3:38:00.920 --> 3:38:06.560]  against me even then. So what they did was I was on public access TV in Long Island and
[3:38:06.560 --> 3:38:13.120]  I did a show about the pedophiles in the high layers of government. They used that to bring
[3:38:13.120 --> 3:38:18.120]  a charge against me that I have a delusion of conspiracy. And even though 10 psychologists
[3:38:18.120 --> 3:38:23.760]  and psychiatrists examined me and found that I was fine, they found their whore from France
[3:38:23.760 --> 3:38:29.120]  to Zev Laban who said, not only do I have a delusion, but it was so dangerous that in
[3:38:29.120 --> 3:38:34.080]  order to practice medicine, I would have to undergo a psychiatric treatment, electroshock
[3:38:34.080 --> 3:38:38.600]  therapy or institutionalization. So that's when I told them they can keep their license.
[3:38:38.600 --> 3:38:42.840]  I'm a teacher now. I've totally taken myself out from under their office.
[3:38:42.840 --> 3:38:48.120]  No, but I read that you'd successfully beaten them. I guess that was wrong. But I mean,
[3:38:48.120 --> 3:38:52.960]  specifically though, so much of what you're saying is in the main line literature and
[3:38:52.960 --> 3:38:57.680]  now they're saying it's mentally ill to believe in a new world order. And they're saying people
[3:38:57.680 --> 3:39:03.760]  need to be grabbed and, you know, they arrested Ezra Pound, the Pulitzer Prize winner, because
[3:39:03.760 --> 3:39:07.720]  he said the Federal Reserve was private and put him in the mental institutions. So people
[3:39:07.720 --> 3:39:10.680]  go to mental institutions, folks, for saying the Federal Reserve is private now.
[3:39:10.680 --> 3:39:14.960]  What? Well, this is a very important thing that I want to make the listeners realize.
[3:39:14.960 --> 3:39:19.200]  They're actually committing genocide, murder by medicine in hospitals now. We all know
[3:39:19.200 --> 3:39:26.280]  the Medicare trust fund is gone. And actually, that's been, you know, a fact for many years.
[3:39:26.280 --> 3:39:29.760]  So what they're doing with older people in the hospital is they're taking them out. They're
[3:39:29.760 --> 3:39:34.840]  giving them morphine to stop their breathing, mismatch blood transfusions. I've actually
[3:39:34.840 --> 3:39:39.760]  been involved with many cases as a patient advocate in cases like that. And people are
[3:39:39.760 --> 3:39:44.120]  complaining about the bad doctors. What you need to do, folks, is stand with the good
[3:39:44.120 --> 3:39:49.360]  doctors. Every single doctor who tells the truth, especially at very extreme levels,
[3:39:49.360 --> 3:39:54.200]  as I do, they go after their medical license. And this is what people have to realize. There's
[3:39:54.200 --> 3:39:59.000]  not going to be any doctors that actually are able to help you. As a matter of fact,
[3:39:59.000 --> 3:40:03.320]  with this national health care plan they have planned for us, they're actually going to
[3:40:03.320 --> 3:40:08.280]  have governmental clinical guidelines. So what we're getting to is a place where you
[3:40:08.280 --> 3:40:11.480]  don't even need a medical doctor. You could have a computer sitting in front of you.
[3:40:11.480 --> 3:40:16.680]  By the way, let me stop you. My dad's a dentist and a neurosurgeon. He said, even before they
[3:40:16.680 --> 3:40:22.160]  passed this federal takeover of medicine, now they give them these computer systems.
[3:40:22.160 --> 3:40:28.080]  And the HMOs and the government tell you everything you can do. And he says the computer is now
[3:40:28.080 --> 3:40:33.360]  the doctor and the government practices medicine. And it's the dentist, the doctors. When you
[3:40:33.360 --> 3:40:37.320]  go into the hospital to have a baby, they ask you, oh, honey, you got plenty of money.
[3:40:37.320 --> 3:40:40.280]  Is your, you know, is your husband nice to you? That's all going to the health department
[3:40:40.280 --> 3:40:46.800]  to see your kids. I mean, it's literally through the public schools and medicine, it is incrementally
[3:40:46.800 --> 3:40:48.160]  a Nazi death camp.
[3:40:48.160 --> 3:40:53.120]  I totally agree with you. And as a matter of fact, the hospitals actually get kickbacks
[3:40:53.120 --> 3:40:58.760]  for any cases that they refer to CPS. And usually it's that they, you know, if the parents
[3:40:58.760 --> 3:41:02.960]  are solution up to admit that they don't vaccinate their children, if they bring them in for
[3:41:02.960 --> 3:41:07.800]  a broken arm or whatever, they get kickbacks for every child that gets into the system
[3:41:07.800 --> 3:41:12.960]  and then gets adapted out or put into foster care, whatever. I mean, medicine has now become
[3:41:12.960 --> 3:41:18.320]  a government entity and it is, it's a vice just like in Nazi Germany. I want to go to
[3:41:18.320 --> 3:41:26.360]  phone calls here. Justin in North Carolina, you're on the air with our guests. Go ahead.
[3:41:26.360 --> 3:41:30.800]  Justin in North Carolina, you're on the air with Dr. Rebecca Carly. Hey, Alex. Hey, Dr.
[3:41:30.800 --> 3:41:35.960]  Carl. How are you all doing today? Okay. We're going to go. My name is Justin. I'm from the
[3:41:35.960 --> 3:41:39.840]  same town in North Carolina that you live now. I'm actually friends with Rick Nunzara.
[3:41:39.840 --> 3:41:45.800]  I was going to ask you a question. Now you said on your website that you have some kind
[3:41:45.800 --> 3:41:50.800]  of cure for the auto, autoimmune diseases. Do you have any kind of list on there for
[3:41:50.800 --> 3:41:55.600]  any kind of natural treatment for, for the bird flu? I mean, if it breaks out tomorrow,
[3:41:55.600 --> 3:42:00.880]  what can we do as citizens to, to get some natural holistic medicines and treat ourselves?
[3:42:00.880 --> 3:42:04.200]  Is there anything that we can have on standby to try to combat this?
[3:42:04.200 --> 3:42:08.000]  Okay. Well, first of all, you're not allowed to use the cure word, Justin, unless you're
[3:42:08.000 --> 3:42:13.080]  using medicine, which of course, here's nothing. No, I'm just saying that's actually a law.
[3:42:13.080 --> 3:42:17.720]  So that's what I do is teach people how to reverse their situations. And what I suggest
[3:42:17.720 --> 3:42:23.480]  to people is, you know, to detoxify yourself as much as possible, eat organic food, drink
[3:42:23.480 --> 3:42:29.320]  good water, learn about natural things that you can use. Organic vitamins, exercise. Yes.
[3:42:29.320 --> 3:42:34.040]  Yes. But do all the good things to get your body in as good shape as possible before
[3:42:34.040 --> 3:42:38.280]  the, the whole thing explodes. But yes, there's actually homeopathic remedies that you can
[3:42:38.280 --> 3:42:43.440]  get against the bird flu. I recommend everybody have a colloidal silver generator, because
[3:42:43.440 --> 3:42:48.160]  of course the FDA is going after colloidal silver manufacturers with a vengeance now.
[3:42:48.160 --> 3:42:53.760]  Hey, hey, hey, they're listing vitamin B variants as medicines now already saying we can't have
[3:42:53.760 --> 3:42:58.520]  them in America. Exactly. So you have to start stocking up folks. You have to get yourself
[3:42:58.520 --> 3:43:03.800]  as healthy as possible now while you're still able to do certain things. But the most important
[3:43:03.800 --> 3:43:08.080]  thing is do not get the bird flu vaccine. When they start pushing this, you have to
[3:43:08.080 --> 3:43:13.760]  just say no. And as your neighbors are dropping dead like flies, just realize that, you know,
[3:43:13.760 --> 3:43:17.800]  all the things in the kitchen covered, I mean, garlic, there's so many things, olive leaf
[3:43:17.800 --> 3:43:18.800]  extract.
[3:43:18.800 --> 3:43:22.960]  Alkydic. Garlic is evil. Alkydic. Keep going.
[3:43:22.960 --> 3:43:27.080]  I would have as many things like that on the hand as you possibly can. But the key thing
[3:43:27.080 --> 3:43:32.880]  is to get your body as cleaned out as possible because your body has the ability to basically
[3:43:32.880 --> 3:43:37.120]  fight anything. Now, of course, they're coming out with weaponized strains of these things.
[3:43:37.120 --> 3:43:42.520]  So something like a bird flu, no cell, which is a homeopathic remedy would be very good.
[3:43:42.520 --> 3:43:46.520]  Unfortunately, you can't buy those. Those aren't sold to the public. You have to go
[3:43:46.520 --> 3:43:50.200]  through distributors, but if people call me, I'll tell you where you can get that. But
[3:43:50.200 --> 3:43:57.000]  the point is to learn what not to do. And, you know, that involves not taking aspartame,
[3:43:57.000 --> 3:43:58.440]  all these things that are making you sick.
[3:43:58.440 --> 3:44:05.280]  But the biggest thing is if it breaks out, don't be around anybody. Run to the hills.
[3:44:05.280 --> 3:44:09.160]  And that's why the British, the U.S., the Canadians troops are saying they're going
[3:44:09.160 --> 3:44:13.640]  to lock down the cities, even if it is in your area yet, they're going to lock you down
[3:44:13.640 --> 3:44:18.780]  to make sure it can get into your city to make sure you can't get out. And I appreciate
[3:44:18.780 --> 3:44:22.760]  your call, Justin. Joe in California, Joe, you're on the air.
[3:44:22.760 --> 3:44:25.400]  Hey, can you hear me?
[3:44:25.400 --> 3:44:26.400]  Yes, sir.
[3:44:26.400 --> 3:44:30.360]  Yeah, I'm happy you guys are talking about this. I was listening to your show the other
[3:44:30.360 --> 3:44:36.920]  day with the ladies that got their house or their school rated, and I wanted to ask about
[3:44:36.920 --> 3:44:42.880]  vaccines. And so I kind of was on the same thing with the guy before, but, you know,
[3:44:42.880 --> 3:44:49.800]  when I just had a son and I said no, they asked me if they can give him the hepatitis
[3:44:49.800 --> 3:44:57.080]  B, a hepatitis C shot. And is that also, I mean, are we talking like all vaccines right
[3:44:57.080 --> 3:44:59.720]  now are pretty much on the note?
[3:44:59.720 --> 3:45:03.360]  Well, let me stop you. She's a medical doctor, but I'll give you the facts. They want to
[3:45:03.360 --> 3:45:08.280]  give this deadly hepatitis shot to newborn babies when you only get it from intravenous
[3:45:08.280 --> 3:45:14.840]  drug use or promiscuous sex. And it's one of the most dangerous vaccines they admit.
[3:45:14.840 --> 3:45:17.800]  And this is the one they want to shoot your baby up with, doctor.
[3:45:17.800 --> 3:45:23.080]  I totally agree with you. As a matter of fact, through a research of a guest that was on
[3:45:23.080 --> 3:45:28.640]  my show, he actually spent a whole day trying to find out why did they start this insanity
[3:45:28.640 --> 3:45:34.200]  with a hepatitis B. And it turns out the reason was that they're taking blood for transfusion
[3:45:34.200 --> 3:45:39.320]  from China, from Chinese prisoners that they know is contaminated with hepatitis B. So
[3:45:39.320 --> 3:45:43.600]  rather than stopping that blood from coming over to this country, they're starting to
[3:45:43.600 --> 3:45:45.160]  give the hepatitis B vaccine.
[3:45:45.160 --> 3:45:48.840]  No, no, no, no, that's what they admit because factor 8 and mayors ship them all out and
[3:45:48.840 --> 3:45:54.040]  others and Baxter, they say, even the literature that we have to give everybody this because
[3:45:54.040 --> 3:45:55.040]  we're contaminating them.
[3:45:55.040 --> 3:46:00.400]  Yes, but the point is, in fact, all vaccines are bad. Please, please look at the documents
[3:46:00.400 --> 3:46:05.520]  on my website. And as long as one of you mentioned the schools, I want to just also mention,
[3:46:05.520 --> 3:46:09.840]  Alex, I'm sure you're aware of this, that one of the plans whenever this breaks, they're
[3:46:09.840 --> 3:46:11.240]  going to lock down the school.
[3:46:11.240 --> 3:46:15.560]  Oh, no, they said that that's public. Yes, and they're going to have pastors there going,
[3:46:15.560 --> 3:46:18.840]  we took your children, it's of the Lord. And if you don't stand down, the preacher will
[3:46:18.840 --> 3:46:23.920]  go, yes, and the SWAT teams open fire. And that's that's on the news. That's confirmed.
[3:46:23.920 --> 3:46:29.000]  And if this is not a time to start homeschooling, I don't know what is because just imagine
[3:46:29.000 --> 3:46:34.120]  folks that all of a sudden you get a notification that whatever false flag event occurred and
[3:46:34.120 --> 3:46:37.280]  your school has been locked down and they've shipped your child off somewhere and you can
[3:46:37.280 --> 3:46:41.400]  go, no, no, no, we have video of FEMA drills where they bust the kids away and don't even
[3:46:41.400 --> 3:46:42.400]  tell the parents about it.
[3:46:42.400 --> 3:46:43.480]  So that's my whole point.
[3:46:43.480 --> 3:46:46.560]  It's just unbelievably disgusting. Does that answer your question, Joe?
[3:46:46.560 --> 3:46:51.000]  Well, another thing when they did want to do that, I, I, right away, I thought of my
[3:46:51.000 --> 3:46:54.880]  buddy Alex Jones and I want to thank you for everything you do and all the information
[3:46:54.880 --> 3:46:59.080]  I get from all of you. But, you know, I just said no right away. I got that, that little
[3:46:59.080 --> 3:47:04.080]  cross-eyed from the doctor. You know, I got the vibe in the room. My wife looked at me
[3:47:04.080 --> 3:47:08.920]  and basically I trust whatever you say. And I just said no. And, um, you know, another
[3:47:08.920 --> 3:47:13.200]  thing that I noticed is that they did this without any permission at all. And they said
[3:47:13.200 --> 3:47:18.280]  it's for your safety, but they clipped a little chip onto them biblical court. And what if
[3:47:18.280 --> 3:47:21.680]  I caught wind that, you know, they, they don't like that. I don't want to get my son
[3:47:21.680 --> 3:47:25.160]  this vaccine. And now all of a sudden I catch wind of CPFs on the way back.
[3:47:25.160 --> 3:47:28.120]  No, no, no, no, that's what it's for. No, no, that's what you're a prisoner. Look, they're
[3:47:28.120 --> 3:47:33.080]  saying Americans can't have gardens now that we need police inspections because we're probably
[3:47:33.080 --> 3:47:37.720]  drug dealers. It's total tyranny. Thanks for the call. Dr. Carly, we're going to come back
[3:47:37.720 --> 3:47:41.800]  in a moment with the final segment, go to Stan, Simon and Sam and a few others. Okay,
[3:47:41.800 --> 3:47:46.800]  I'm going to put you on hold. All right. Okay. This is unbelievable. I just want to remind
[3:47:46.800 --> 3:47:51.800]  people the Obama deception is now out at prisonplanet.tv. And when you know all this serious stuff,
[3:47:51.800 --> 3:47:57.080]  how silly is it they're worshiping Obama and think he's a good guy? He works for the government
[3:47:57.080 --> 3:48:00.760]  and the globalists and the eugenicists that are carrying this out. There was a revolution
[3:48:00.760 --> 3:48:06.800]  against tyranny. People were waking up. So they put this guy out there to sell the public
[3:48:06.800 --> 3:48:12.840]  on being suckered. I know all this sounds crazy. It's, it's true. And I just can't believe
[3:48:12.840 --> 3:48:16.960]  such psychos are in control, but look at Hitler, look at Stalin, look at now, look at the Babylonians,
[3:48:16.960 --> 3:48:22.280]  the Romans, the end of the Aztecs. This is what elites do. They're crazy. They want control.
[3:48:22.280 --> 3:48:26.520]  They're control freaks. So please get the Obama deception on DVD at infowars.com or
[3:48:26.520 --> 3:48:31.120]  see it right now at prisonplanet.tv. Also, some of our sponsors that make this show possible,
[3:48:31.120 --> 3:48:39.240]  efoodsdirect.com. That's www. The letter efoodsdirect.com, big banners up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[3:48:39.240 --> 3:48:44.040]  We don't have to remind you that you need to have food to survive. Our biggest sponsor,
[3:48:44.040 --> 3:48:48.080]  eFoodsDirect, is the longest continually operating storeable foods company in the country. They
[3:48:48.080 --> 3:48:52.400]  also happen to be true patriots and have supported freedom movement for years with the looming
[3:48:52.400 --> 3:48:57.560]  problems and the depression and all the craziness. You need this high quality non-GMO, clean,
[3:48:57.560 --> 3:49:02.280]  storeable foods. Go to efoodsdirect.com and you can watch the free videos and see their

[3:49:13.440 --> 3:49:22.040]  efoodsdirect.com. That's 800-409-5633. Also, need to get prepared, need to get self-sufficient
[3:49:22.040 --> 3:49:28.880]  and one of those fine sponsors, of course, are the folks at survivalseedbank.com. In
[3:49:28.880 --> 3:49:32.320]  a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply
[3:49:32.320 --> 3:49:36.160]  of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones. There have been times in American history,
[3:49:36.160 --> 3:49:39.880]  Pilgrims, for example, when seeds had the highest value of any barter item, even silver
[3:49:39.880 --> 3:49:45.760]  or gold. The globalists are buying up all the major heirlooms seed companies and non-GMO
[3:49:45.760 --> 3:49:50.600]  seed companies and hoarding them, not selling them, but the great folks at survivalseedbank.com
[3:49:50.600 --> 3:50:01.000]  have it. Give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365 or again, survivalseedbank.com.
[3:50:01.000 --> 3:50:09.960]  Absolutely fabulous folks there and I hope that people will take advantage of that.
[3:50:09.960 --> 3:50:18.120]  We're going to come back in the final segment and get into a few phone calls here at the
[3:50:18.120 --> 3:50:21.400]  end, but it just totally blows me away when we're talking about this and dealing with
[3:50:21.400 --> 3:50:26.680]  all this and people calling me and saying, Alan, she has so much courage, you're so great.
[3:50:26.680 --> 3:50:31.640]  What does it matter? Everybody's got horrible allergies. People with cancer rates are exploding.
[3:50:31.640 --> 3:50:35.880]  It used to be very rare to see a kid die of cancer. Now it's everywhere. They're building
[3:50:35.880 --> 3:50:39.120]  FEMA camps. They're putting troops into all the major police departments and admitting
[3:50:39.120 --> 3:50:43.000]  it and troops on the streets and spying on everybody and corruption and getting ready
[3:50:43.000 --> 3:50:47.800]  for World War III and all this evil and they got this Obama with youth brigades and all
[3:50:47.800 --> 3:50:52.440]  these gunband bills introduced and they're demonizing Ron Paul saying his supporters
[3:50:52.440 --> 3:50:57.080]  are terrorist and secret government documents we now have up on infowars.com. I mean, it's
[3:50:57.080 --> 3:51:02.640]  just, we got to fight these people. It's all we can do. Come on.
[3:51:02.640 --> 3:51:07.400]  This year millions of people will lose electricity, ice storms, earthquakes, flooding or hurricanes
[3:51:07.400 --> 3:51:11.800]  could leave you without power for days. Anyone that's ever been in a blackout knows that
[3:51:11.800 --> 3:51:16.560]  the first thing you need is a flashlight. That's why you need the pack light. The pack
[3:51:16.560 --> 3:51:22.400]  light is powered by a 9 volt battery and lasts up to 1200 hours. It's so small it fits right
[3:51:22.400 --> 3:51:27.960]  in your pocket and glows in the dark, making it easy to find when you need it most. One
[3:51:27.960 --> 3:51:33.680]  Florida customer says, my pack light has lasted through four hurricane in two years, over
[3:51:33.680 --> 3:51:38.240]  30 days without electricity and I'm still using the same battery.

[3:52:02.480 --> 3:52:08.560]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:08.560 --> 3:52:13.080]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[3:52:13.080 --> 3:52:16.920]  us would like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the
[3:52:16.920 --> 3:52:20.920]  myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[3:52:20.920 --> 3:52:25.280]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:25.280 --> 3:52:30.360]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:52:30.360 --> 3:52:38.480]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:38.480 --> 3:52:43.280]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government. This film documents
[3:52:43.280 --> 3:52:49.000]  who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:54:31.040 --> 3:54:35.240]  Reserve in. They have a good chance of passing if we believe and get behind it.
[3:54:35.240 --> 3:54:38.840]  But bottom line we need to learn to address the criminals and if they need to be arrested

[3:55:21.240 --> 3:55:25.240]  let's work together here. We got to defeat the new world order. Let's take a few final
[3:55:25.240 --> 3:55:32.120]  calls for Dr. Carly here. Let's talk to Stan in Missouri. Stan you're on the air. Welcome.
[3:55:32.120 --> 3:55:36.200]  Hello Alex and Dr. Kelly. I don't think the American people are going to go along with
[3:55:36.200 --> 3:55:40.720]  these forced flu vaccinations. Dr. Kelly is more an expert than I am on the subject.
[3:55:40.720 --> 3:55:45.920]  But if you knew what they put in that smallpox vaccine when they manufactured Alex years
[3:55:45.920 --> 3:55:51.720]  ago it'd make your hair cruel. I had a copy of that. And I do believe that they manufactured
[3:55:51.720 --> 3:55:55.840]  that with horse hair and pus and just all kinds of. No they did. That's what comes from
[3:55:55.840 --> 3:56:01.880]  it. It comes from Cal pus sir. Cal pus. Dr. Carly correct? Yes. Yes. And let me just
[3:56:01.880 --> 3:56:05.800]  say there's actually a book that was written almost a century ago that you can download
[3:56:05.800 --> 3:56:11.640]  off my website entitled of whores of vaccination exposed and illustrated that explains everything
[3:56:11.640 --> 3:56:15.960]  about the smallpox vaccine and the whores that it reached at that time so they know
[3:56:15.960 --> 3:56:20.600]  exactly what they're doing. Alex were you aware that Chuck Norris is going to have a
[3:56:20.600 --> 3:56:27.160]  meeting tomorrow night at 5 p.m. It's going to be a live telecast. We surround them concerning
[3:56:27.160 --> 3:56:30.480]  the concerns for America. Would you have to know what channel that's going to be on
[3:56:30.480 --> 3:56:34.000]  tomorrow night? You know I heard something about Chuck Norris and I've got his contact
[3:56:34.000 --> 3:56:38.040]  info and I didn't even pay attention. I've been on this Ron Paul People Are Terrorist
[3:56:38.040 --> 3:56:42.720]  stuff. What is Chuck Norris even saying? Well they're going to have a bunch of cell groups.
[3:56:42.720 --> 3:56:47.760]  I don't know if they're going to be placing a concerns tomorrow night concerns on the
[3:56:47.760 --> 3:56:52.400]  nation and I don't know if that's going to hold it. Excuse me. Stop. Stop. You guys I
[3:56:52.400 --> 3:56:57.520]  saw it on the info wars yesterday. I didn't read it. What is Chuck Norris doing? I've
[3:56:57.520 --> 3:57:04.080]  got his private email. I can't hear him. I suddenly can't hear the caller. I've lost
[3:57:04.080 --> 3:57:11.240]  it. Yeah. Oh whatever man. Okay. What specifically is it? Thousands of cell groups will be united
[3:57:11.240 --> 3:57:15.920]  around the country in solidarity over concerns of nations. Right wing cell groups will meet
[3:57:15.920 --> 3:57:21.600]  during a live telecast. We surround them on Friday, March the 13th at 5 p.m. What does
[3:57:21.600 --> 3:57:27.760]  that mean? I mean this is really confusing. I mean we'll post something right now. I saw
[3:57:27.760 --> 3:57:32.320]  Chuck Norris is having some event. He's saying cell groups surround them. I mean what are
[3:57:32.320 --> 3:57:37.800]  you saying? Well I'm not sure what he's trying to say unless he's saying that the right wing
[3:57:37.800 --> 3:57:41.760]  militias are going to start rising up about the tyranny that's going on in this country
[3:57:41.760 --> 3:57:47.560]  Alex. I'm not sure what he's saying. I better. I don't know why. I don't really bug these
[3:57:47.560 --> 3:57:52.000]  celebrities. I have his contact info. I wondered why Pastor Butch was calling up on his contact
[3:57:52.000 --> 3:57:57.560]  info earlier. I'm just trying to find out what channel this is going to be on because
[3:57:57.560 --> 3:58:02.240]  I'm like you. I don't know. It's from all night at 5 p.m. And where is Chuck Norris
[3:58:02.240 --> 3:58:08.480]  having a cell group? Well I know from my understanding that Chuck's living in Texas now. He's supposed
[3:58:08.480 --> 3:58:12.040]  to have a ranch out there. No no no. He's going by Houston and by Austin. We're going
[3:58:12.040 --> 3:58:18.000]  to overdrive. Can we go into overdrive guys? Okay thank you. Dr. Carly thank you. Again
[3:58:18.000 --> 3:58:23.800]  I can't keep track of everything. It's an info war story and it's mainstream news. The
[3:58:23.800 --> 3:58:28.040]  examiner out of England and you won't hear this on the M&F and folks. It will be on the
[3:58:28.040 --> 3:58:34.000]  internet streams at infowars.com only. Thank you Dr. Carly. Thank you so much Alex. You
[3:58:34.000 --> 3:58:37.560]  bet. Take care. We're going to go to break for one minute here and then I'm going to

[4:00:01.480 --> 4:00:07.240]  Okay. I got so distracted with the fact that they're teaching the state police that Ron
[4:00:07.240 --> 4:00:19.240]  Paul supporters are terrorists. And I got so distracted with everything else going on
[4:00:19.240 --> 4:00:23.320]  around her and the Obama deception release and in my gut we had to release it early.
[4:00:23.320 --> 4:00:26.960]  And now I'm reading mainstream news. We had it up yesterday. I just missed it. The call
[4:00:26.960 --> 4:00:30.640]  by some right wing leaders for rebellion and the military refused the commander in chief's
[4:00:30.640 --> 4:00:34.560]  orders is joined by Chuck Norris who claims that thousands of right wing cell groups
[4:00:34.560 --> 4:00:38.520]  have organized and are ready for a second American Revolution during an appearance
[4:00:38.520 --> 4:00:42.960]  on the Glenn Beck show. I told you he's been doing some weird siob, Glenn Beck. He promised
[4:00:42.960 --> 4:00:47.720]  that if things ever get worse from this point of view he may run for president of Texas.
[4:00:47.720 --> 4:00:52.080]  The martial artist actor claims that Texas were never formally part of the United States
[4:00:52.080 --> 4:00:55.960]  in the first place and the rebellion is to come through succession. Texas would lead
[4:00:55.960 --> 4:00:59.840]  the way. So we have all these states declaring succession. I think this is a way to make
[4:00:59.840 --> 4:01:03.480]  themselves the way to co-opt it or something. I'm not saying Norris is bad, but he may be
[4:01:03.480 --> 4:01:08.240]  being used here today in a syndicate of column on world net daily Norris reiterates the point.
[4:01:08.240 --> 4:01:16.040]  They may need to be a reality sooner than we think. You know what, guys? Go to infowars.com
[4:01:16.040 --> 4:01:21.520]  right now and play my director clip six minutes where I reach out to everybody. Print me this
[4:01:21.520 --> 4:01:25.600]  article. I have to read it and analyze it. I think I know what this is, but I have to
[4:01:25.600 --> 4:01:34.440]  read it before I give a comment on it. So go to infowars.com right now on the main page.
[4:01:34.440 --> 4:01:38.360]  That's just the Chuck Norris article. Skip that. Just print that for me. And then go
[4:01:38.360 --> 4:01:48.200]  to infowars.com, the main page, and click on Alex reaches out to Obama supporters. I

[4:01:58.120 --> 4:02:02.080]  on the main page. You can't miss it. You can get more than one computer in there hooked
[4:02:02.080 --> 4:02:06.680]  into the feed net so we can do things about our nest because it's shutting down and they're
[4:02:06.680 --> 4:02:11.680]  on me. Just run music for a while. We'll be back in a little while.
[4:02:11.680 --> 4:02:24.680]  We were running against the wind. I found myself seeking shelter against the wind.
[4:02:41.680 --> 4:03:01.680]  All those drifters days are past me now. I've got so much more to think about.
[4:03:01.680 --> 4:03:23.680]  We were running against the wind. We found ourselves seeking shelter against the wind.
[4:03:23.680 --> 4:03:45.680]  Against the wind.
[4:03:45.680 --> 4:04:13.680]  We were running against the wind. We found ourselves seeking shelter against the wind.
[4:04:13.680 --> 4:04:41.680]  We were running against the wind. We found ourselves seeking shelter against the wind.
[4:04:41.680 --> 4:04:57.680]  We were running against the wind. We were running against the wind.
[4:05:11.680 --> 4:05:37.680]  We were running against the wind. We were running against the wind.
[4:05:37.680 --> 4:06:03.680]  We were running against the wind. We were running against the wind.
[4:06:03.680 --> 4:06:31.680]  We were running against the wind. We were running against the wind.
[4:06:31.680 --> 4:06:51.680]  We were running against the wind. We were running against the wind.
[4:06:51.680 --> 4:07:11.680]  We were running against the wind. We were running against the wind.
[4:07:11.680 --> 4:07:31.680]  Okay, you know, in the past I said things would happen once a year so that were key trigger points.
[4:07:31.680 --> 4:07:41.680]  And I've always known that Chuck Norris would wind up being important in this whole equation.
[4:07:41.680 --> 4:07:51.680]  Chuck Norris told me privately off air during breaks and actually you were witnesses to it. We didn't put it out over air. Remember that he's actually a big fan. He knows about all this stuff but he can't get into it because of his position.
[4:07:51.680 --> 4:08:01.680]  He's woken up to the New World Order that he didn't really believe me totally ten years ago but he has a place outside Austin and a ranch outside Houston. Folks really don't know he has that place.
[4:08:01.680 --> 4:08:12.680]  Well, I'm not going to get into what the point is. And he gave me his wife's email and said contact him there. He'd like to come back on and that, you know, things kept getting worse. He would basically come out more.
[4:08:12.680 --> 4:08:20.680]  Well, I haven't messed with him since then. And then about a month ago, months after I had interviewed him for the first time, I never liked this.
[4:08:20.680 --> 4:08:32.680]  Two in the morning I was trying to go to sleep and I said no. That Chuck Norris book he sent me, it's got his email address written in it and I've never contacted him and I need to go find that book in the house and I dug around and found it.
[4:08:32.680 --> 4:08:41.680]  And I gave it to my producer and said put this in the computer. I need to be in contact with him and I just never got around to it. I was making the Obama deception.
[4:08:41.680 --> 4:08:54.680]  And then I've been watching this Glenn Beck situation and who said put Ron Paul supporters in prison, used the military against him, basically the talking points from this.
[4:08:54.680 --> 4:09:03.680]  I saw, you know, these government documents. I knew it was a talking point. They were saying the same thing here. We're terrorists. We want to kill police. We're Ron Paul supporters. We believe in an imaginary new world order.
[4:09:03.680 --> 4:09:12.680]  Then suddenly back to what it's saying he believes in a new world order, but then he always slips in other propaganda. I know that's bad. I don't think Chuck Norris is bad.
[4:09:12.680 --> 4:09:28.680]  And I think he's so he has come out and said get ready for revolution and it's just it's just wild. And I think he might be being set up here.
[4:09:28.680 --> 4:09:36.680]  I mean, I really don't think this guy is an evil person. I think he's been gulled by the fake right wing system. And now he realizes Obama in the new world order is real.
[4:09:36.680 --> 4:09:43.680]  And that's what he's saying. And so he's saying he's going to fight it. Go ahead and play this little six minute clip where I talk to the Obama supporters.
[4:09:43.680 --> 4:09:51.680]  I want to focus on this more and really write some notes and make this very concise. This is a huge deal. See, and I can't, I can't catch every football.
[4:09:51.680 --> 4:09:58.680]  It's like 10 of them are getting thrown at me every second and I'm dropping them all the time and I saw something Chuck Norris makes going to make big announcement.
[4:09:58.680 --> 4:10:04.680]  And as you're making it on Turkey show, print me the world that daily thing to it's linked in this story.
[4:10:04.680 --> 4:10:11.680]  Then we had computers shut down and have problems right in the middle of this when we went into overdrive. So Cruz doing a great job.
[4:10:11.680 --> 4:10:24.680]  That's why I'm having trouble printing these. He's saying revolution may happen sooner than we think. It's not me. Someone someday may begin to be running for president.
[4:10:24.680 --> 4:10:35.680]  But then he talks about Texas leaving. There's all these states talking about it. He talks about cell grips around the country and solidarity over the concerns of our nation.
[4:10:35.680 --> 4:10:43.680]  Right wing cells will be meeting during a live telecast. We surround them.
[4:10:43.680 --> 4:10:51.680]  And he, so he's saying we know the new owners taking over, but there's more of us than are of you. That's what Mark Corky always says. We surround you.
[4:10:51.680 --> 4:11:00.680]  It's like moose hunting. He closed with the words of San Houston, followed by a plug for his next martial arts event. We view ourselves on the eve of battle.
[4:11:00.680 --> 4:11:13.680]  I mean, Chuck Norris has never acted like this. This is what happens, though. I basically deprogram people. And he told me that. You guys were in there. Hey, guys, there were two of you in there at the time.
[4:11:13.680 --> 4:11:21.680]  I know it was Hoosian. Bill were in there. And of course, during the break, I could have put it out on there, but I didn't. We didn't record it because we're nice guys.
[4:11:21.680 --> 4:11:28.680]  We don't talk to people and record them. It's just to know, he's like, yes, I know all about it. I just have to think about how to go public.
[4:11:28.680 --> 4:11:35.680]  And then now to have it happening right here. But I don't trust Beck being involved in all this.
[4:11:35.680 --> 4:11:41.680]  You guys print me the World Net Daily. Did you find it? All you do is go to this art. I need to get my computer in here printed and able.
[4:11:41.680 --> 4:11:47.680]  Can we just do that? Because I've been, I'm not bitching, but I mean, I've asked and asked and asked. It's like I'm a Chinese emperor.
[4:11:47.680 --> 4:11:54.680]  I can't cut my fingernails here. Everything's done by you guys. Can I, I just need the World Net Daily.
[4:11:54.680 --> 4:12:00.680]  Because I want to read that too. I need to analyze this. Are you guys ready to play the six minute clip and I can figure it out during that period?
[4:12:00.680 --> 4:12:06.680]  Okay, great job. And then I'll come back and do that. I've got other radio interviews I've got to do, but I'm about to cancel those.
[4:12:06.680 --> 4:12:12.680]  Oh, where's the folder of radio interviews? Folks, welcome to my world. I mean, this is what I do. This is what it's like.
[4:12:12.680 --> 4:12:17.680]  It's just, and it's all coming to a head. Everything is quickening right now.
[4:12:17.680 --> 4:12:23.680]  I've got a folder here with my guest list. Here it is.
[4:12:23.680 --> 4:12:27.680]  Okay, Uncle Nasty Libertarian Talk Show.
[4:12:27.680 --> 4:12:33.680]  And then I'm doing a show out of Indiana on Talk Station.
[4:12:33.680 --> 4:12:39.680]  When is this interview? You have to multitask. I have to do this on air, folks.
[4:12:39.680 --> 4:12:46.680]  That's bizarre. They've got yesterday's interviews in that one.
[4:12:46.680 --> 4:12:50.680]  Okay, that's at four o'clock. I got time for that.
[4:12:50.680 --> 4:12:55.680]  You know what? I want to give a proper analysis of this, so I need those stories. I need to take a break.
[4:12:55.680 --> 4:13:02.680]  Let's go ahead and roll this clip. Obama Deception Director Alex Jones reaches out to Obama supporters.
[4:13:02.680 --> 4:13:06.680]  Because if we just attack them from a right-wing perspective, it'll get them more in their core support of Obama.
[4:13:06.680 --> 4:13:10.680]  I believe the leader wanting to foment violent revolution. I've been saying that. We know they do.
[4:13:10.680 --> 4:13:17.680]  And this is just, it's all getting out of control because if Chuck Norris tells people to start a shooting war, it'll happen.
[4:13:17.680 --> 4:13:21.680]  Okay.
[4:13:21.680 --> 4:13:29.680]  Good God. You know, I remember when I was told ten years ago by state police and police in Dallas that Chuck Norris was a huge fan.
[4:13:29.680 --> 4:13:33.680]  And then I actually got contacted and talked to him.
[4:13:33.680 --> 4:13:39.680]  And then I never bugged him again. And then talked to him again and found out he's been listening for that long.
[4:13:39.680 --> 4:13:45.680]  And knows all about it, but doesn't go completely public. Thank you.
[4:13:45.680 --> 4:13:53.680]  All right. I'm going to go mark these articles up. Read them.
[4:13:53.680 --> 4:13:57.680]  No, this is not the Chuck Norris article.
[4:13:57.680 --> 4:14:03.680]  What you do is you go to Chuck Norris, claims thousands of right-wing cell groups exist and were belling against America.
[4:14:03.680 --> 4:14:07.680]  It's the third paragraph down as the link to the world net daily.
[4:14:07.680 --> 4:14:11.680]  I mean, I just Googled Chuck Norris cell groups and it came up.
[4:14:11.680 --> 4:14:15.680]  I'll come do it. Go ahead and play the clip. Please, guys, we'll be right back. Stay with us.
[4:14:15.680 --> 4:14:19.680]  This is very important transmission. Please stay with us. Call everybody, you know, tell them to tune in right now.
[4:14:19.680 --> 4:14:35.680]  The info wars.com present planet.com streams. Here it is.
[4:14:35.680 --> 4:14:41.680]  The Obama deception is about who the real Barack Obama is, not the right wing version or the left wing version.
[4:14:41.680 --> 4:14:51.680]  We cut through all that. We show who's financing the lies he is told and what his real agenda is.
[4:14:51.680 --> 4:14:58.680]  The Obama deception will be the first major documentary put out after his election that is critical.
[4:14:58.680 --> 4:15:04.680]  All the right wing guys are still making films about is he really from Kenya or is he a communist?
[4:15:04.680 --> 4:15:10.680]  We're not touching any of those red herrings. Whether they're true or not, we don't know we can't prove it.
[4:15:10.680 --> 4:15:13.680]  We do know he lied about keeping troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[4:15:13.680 --> 4:15:18.680]  We do know he lied about warrantless wiretapping. We do know he lied about shutting down camps.
[4:15:18.680 --> 4:15:22.680]  We do know that he lied about getting rid of NAFTA and Gatton is now expanding it.
[4:15:22.680 --> 4:15:30.680]  And so this film is about Obama being a puppet, who he works for, and then we get past the puppet to the real agenda of his controllers.
[4:15:30.680 --> 4:15:34.680]  Barack Obama is controlled by offshore banks.
[4:15:34.680 --> 4:15:40.680]  This film details how they bankrupt the world economy, how they control the currencies of the planet,
[4:15:40.680 --> 4:15:45.680]  and how the bankers want to destroy the economy so they can buy everything up for pennies on the dollar.
[4:15:45.680 --> 4:15:50.680]  That's why the Obama deception is so important, because it gives you the master plan.
[4:15:50.680 --> 4:15:52.680]  It gives you the big overarching agenda.
[4:15:52.680 --> 4:15:55.680]  So you understand how the world really works and where this planet's going.
[4:15:55.680 --> 4:16:02.680]  And it gives you the viewer the choice to be conned, to be a sucker by the Republicans, the Rush Limbaugh's on the right,
[4:16:02.680 --> 4:16:08.680]  and by the controlled left, the Obamas, or whether you want to finally break the spell, break the paradigm,
[4:16:08.680 --> 4:16:14.680]  and realize they're all bought and paid for, and the real enemy are these private banks running these giant Ponzi schemes.
[4:16:14.680 --> 4:16:30.680]  When the public finds out they've had their entire futures robbed, when they find out that a total tyranny has been brought into place,
[4:16:30.680 --> 4:16:34.680]  they are going to get so angry the elite has to bring in the police state.
[4:16:34.680 --> 4:16:36.680]  They have to put regular army troops on the streets.
[4:16:36.680 --> 4:16:38.680]  They have to have FEMA camps.
[4:16:38.680 --> 4:16:41.680]  They have to get rid of hideous corpus and have secret arrest,
[4:16:41.680 --> 4:16:48.680]  because the public is going to be an open revolt, and the government admits they're gearing up to use the military against the American people.
[4:16:48.680 --> 4:16:56.680]  Six months before Obama was elected, when he was still an underdog, we had figured out that he was the heir apparent,
[4:16:56.680 --> 4:17:03.680]  that he was the anointed one, that he was the special person that the elite was going to put in power to sell the public on their agenda.
[4:17:03.680 --> 4:17:08.680]  Then I saw how the media was getting behind him in such a unified way,
[4:17:08.680 --> 4:17:12.680]  and I knew the media likes to pose as liberal or conservative, but really they're owned by the bomb makers,
[4:17:12.680 --> 4:17:15.680]  they're owned by the military industrial complex and the big banks.
[4:17:15.680 --> 4:17:18.680]  So they had to come in with a Madison Avenue fraud.
[4:17:18.680 --> 4:17:24.680]  They had to put a black face on the New World Order as KRS won, and Webster, Tarpley, and many others have said.
[4:17:24.680 --> 4:17:33.680]  They had to give people a stake in it with just the surface packaging of, oh look, he's black, things have changed, everything's okay, stand down.
[4:17:33.680 --> 4:17:36.680]  This is an attempt to suppress revolution.
[4:17:36.680 --> 4:17:42.680]  This is an attempt to suppress a massive renaissance taking place worldwide to the globalist tyranny.
[4:17:42.680 --> 4:17:48.680]  And so that's why we've made the Obama deception, and that's why we're asking listeners and viewers to get the film,
[4:17:48.680 --> 4:17:54.680]  to make copies of it, to get it out to everyone they know.
[4:17:54.680 --> 4:17:59.680]  And one thing I want to make clear, I respect Barack Obama supporters.
[4:17:59.680 --> 4:18:06.680]  Their fervent support of him wasn't so much about Obama, it was about a repudiation of George Bush,
[4:18:06.680 --> 4:18:14.680]  clearly stealing two elections, clearly attacking the Constitution and Bill of Rights from one end to the other,
[4:18:14.680 --> 4:18:19.680]  and lying about WMDs and all these wars and the million-plus dead Iraqis.
[4:18:19.680 --> 4:18:25.680]  The American people don't like all this being done in their name, so they were desperate for somebody who promised to change it.
[4:18:25.680 --> 4:18:35.680]  But as soon as he got in, he flip-flopped on all of it, but he didn't just stop there, he then accelerated the whole program.
[4:18:35.680 --> 4:18:43.680]  This film is reaching out to people that are supporting Barack Obama, and it's saying, please, just take the time out to watch this film,
[4:18:43.680 --> 4:18:47.680]  take the time out, write down notes, research the claims we make.
[4:18:47.680 --> 4:18:53.680]  We're saying that no matter who's in office, this agenda continues, and until we address the power behind the throne,
[4:18:53.680 --> 4:19:00.680]  until we address these roundtables, these private banking consortiums, these corporate systems that have taken over our governments,
[4:19:00.680 --> 4:19:10.680]  just like they take over another corporation in a hostile takeover, until we address that, nothing's going to get better.
[4:19:10.680 --> 4:19:17.680]  The elite saw revolution brewing in the United States and all over the world against globalism and the globalist agenda.
[4:19:17.680 --> 4:19:29.680]  We can actually use the hype of Obama, we can actually use his betrayal to once and for all wake up the people and shatter the false left-right paradigm forever.
[4:19:29.680 --> 4:19:34.680]  You know, I get passionate when I talk about...
[4:19:34.680 --> 4:19:36.680] ...
[4:19:48.680 --> 4:19:50.680]  Barack Obama is controlled by offshore banks.
[4:19:50.680 --> 4:19:52.680]  Okay, we're live here, ladies and gentlemen.
[4:19:52.680 --> 4:19:53.680]  How they bankrupt?
[4:19:53.680 --> 4:19:54.680]  Right now.
[4:19:54.680 --> 4:20:02.680]  Okay, now, again, I've been seeing something form, something develop with Glenn Beck,
[4:20:02.680 --> 4:20:06.680]  who's shed put Ron Paul supporters in prison, used the military against him.
[4:20:06.680 --> 4:20:09.680]  9-11 triathers are scum, their families are scum, and then he'll say,
[4:20:09.680 --> 4:20:12.680]  I want to fight the new old order, we got to fight Iran to do that.
[4:20:12.680 --> 4:20:16.680]  Iran's got nukes, he's got a nucus, and boy, I'm scared of the Babas and their guns.
[4:20:16.680 --> 4:20:20.680]  And so he basically introduces everything that's in these federal intelligence reports where they say,
[4:20:20.680 --> 4:20:24.680]  anybody who loves freedoms of terrorists that we've been covering.
[4:20:24.680 --> 4:20:34.680]  And I did get his World Net Daily story, which we're going to punch up on screen right here.
[4:20:34.680 --> 4:20:41.680]  And I will go over that article for folks.
[4:20:41.680 --> 4:20:44.680]  But here's the examiner newspaper out of the UK reporting on it.
[4:20:44.680 --> 4:20:49.680]  Chuck Norris claims thousands of right-wing cell groups exist from rebel against US government.
[4:20:49.680 --> 4:20:50.680]  See, they want to make it.
[4:20:50.680 --> 4:20:52.680]  I'm not saying Chuck's doing this.
[4:20:52.680 --> 4:20:53.680]  A left-wing, right-wing thing.
[4:20:53.680 --> 4:20:57.680]  So the Obama people will circle around him, and they could say it's a right-wing attack,
[4:20:57.680 --> 4:21:00.680]  instead of, no, the bankers own both parties.
[4:21:00.680 --> 4:21:08.680]  See, Norris came out and repudiated Bush and Obama and got into big new world war picture immediately.
[4:21:08.680 --> 4:21:09.680]  That would happen.
[4:21:09.680 --> 4:21:15.680]  Reading over a lot of what he has to say, there's some of that, but that's not everything that's in there.
[4:21:15.680 --> 4:21:19.680]  But let me just read the examiner.
[4:21:19.680 --> 4:21:22.680]  You know, I can't print my stories in infowarzen.com or prismplanet.com,
[4:21:22.680 --> 4:21:25.680]  because if they have 300 comments on them, it's like 100 pages,
[4:21:25.680 --> 4:21:27.680]  and we don't have printer-friendly versions on infowarzen.
[4:21:27.680 --> 4:21:28.680]  I don't know why.
[4:21:28.680 --> 4:21:30.680]  I've asked for it, but we don't have it.
[4:21:30.680 --> 4:21:33.680]  And so I've been trying to print the article, so I can actually read it here on air.
[4:21:33.680 --> 4:21:36.680]  Thank you, during this 12-ring circus that's going on.
[4:21:36.680 --> 4:21:38.680]  But they call...
[4:21:38.680 --> 4:21:41.680]  Well, let me read the editors' note from Curtin M.O. first.
[4:21:41.680 --> 4:21:46.680]  The following article is an example of how far we have drifted from our constitutional principles in this country.
[4:21:46.680 --> 4:21:52.680]  The author of this article seems to think reclaiming the country in the name of the Constitution of the Bill of Rights is a right-wing concept.
[4:21:52.680 --> 4:21:56.680]  And we follow this logic, then the left wing wants to turn a dictatorship in the police state.
[4:21:56.680 --> 4:22:01.680]  In fact, it seems Chuck Norris is moving away from the Republican Party in his article on World Net Daily.
[4:22:01.680 --> 4:22:02.680]  Link below.
[4:22:02.680 --> 4:22:07.680]  He claims there is a little difference between the two parties and is calling for a second American Revolution.
[4:22:07.680 --> 4:22:09.680]  So he's getting it right.
[4:22:09.680 --> 4:22:13.680]  If this is right-wing, count me in, says Curtin M.O.
[4:22:13.680 --> 4:22:20.680]  The call by some right-wing leaders for rebellion and the military to refuse the commander in chief's orders is joined by Chuck Norris.
[4:22:20.680 --> 4:22:23.680]  The globalists will just stage a terror attack and then the military will get in line.
[4:22:23.680 --> 4:22:28.680]  He claims that thousands of right-wing cell groups have organized and is ready for a second American Revolution.
[4:22:28.680 --> 4:22:36.680]  During an appearance on the Glenn Beck radio show, he promised that if things get any worse, from this point of view, he may run for president of Texas.
[4:22:36.680 --> 4:22:41.680]  The martial arts actor, activist claims that Texas was never formerly part of the United States.
[4:22:41.680 --> 4:22:42.680]  Well, that's a fact.
[4:22:42.680 --> 4:22:43.680]  It's a Lone Star State.
[4:22:43.680 --> 4:22:44.680]  It, by treaty, signed in.
[4:22:44.680 --> 4:22:50.680]  The United States is the first place and that rebellion is to come through succession.
[4:22:50.680 --> 4:22:52.680]  Texas would lead the way.
[4:22:52.680 --> 4:23:00.680]  This is a syndicated column on World Net Daily Norris reiterates the point that need may be a reality sooner than we think.
[4:23:00.680 --> 4:23:06.680]  If not me, someone, somebody may again be running for president of the Lone Star State.
[4:23:06.680 --> 4:23:10.680]  In the State of the Union, they went and killed folks that tried that previously in Texas.
[4:23:10.680 --> 4:23:16.680]  The State of the Union continues to turn into the enemy of the state.
[4:23:16.680 --> 4:23:19.680]  He continues calling on a second American Revolution.
[4:23:19.680 --> 4:23:29.680]  We've bastardized the First Amendment, reinterpreted America's religious history, and secularized our society until we ooze skepticism and circumvent religion
[4:23:29.680 --> 4:23:31.680]  on every level in public private life.
[4:23:31.680 --> 4:23:32.680]  Why not about the FEMA camps?
[4:23:32.680 --> 4:23:35.680]  Why not about the troops standing about to take over?
[4:23:35.680 --> 4:23:38.680]  How much more will Americans take?
[4:23:38.680 --> 4:23:40.680]  When will enough be enough?
[4:23:40.680 --> 4:23:47.680]  And when that time comes, will our leaders finally listen or will history need to record a second American Revolution?
[4:23:47.680 --> 4:23:55.680]  We, the people, have the authority, according to American Declaration of Independence, which states that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends,
[4:23:55.680 --> 4:23:59.680]  it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and to institute a new government.
[4:23:59.680 --> 4:24:06.680]  Norris claims that thousands of cell groups have been united around the country in solidarity over the concerns of our nation.
[4:24:06.680 --> 4:24:09.680]  The right-wing cells will meet during a live telecast.
[4:24:09.680 --> 4:24:12.680]  So the right-wing cells help bring in the whole police state Obama is now using.
[4:24:12.680 --> 4:24:15.680]  We surround them on Friday, March 13th at 5 p.m.
[4:24:15.680 --> 4:24:16.680]  Where?
[4:24:16.680 --> 4:24:21.680]  He closes with the words of Sam Houston followed by a plug, and it goes on.
[4:24:21.680 --> 4:24:23.680]  We view ourselves on the eve of battle.
[4:24:23.680 --> 4:24:25.680]  I mean, what is this telecast?
[4:24:25.680 --> 4:24:26.680]  Where is that?
[4:24:26.680 --> 4:24:30.680]  In the article, what is it linked to when he talks about the telecast?
[4:24:30.680 --> 4:24:38.680]  Just control F search, telecast, and pull up that link off the page for me, please.
[4:24:38.680 --> 4:24:43.680]  Use it, control F, and then box it open, and you can enter that and you can find it for me.
[4:24:43.680 --> 4:24:55.680]  Or I could start surfing it, but you guys are in control of that page right now.
[4:24:55.680 --> 4:24:58.680]  We – and it goes on to say on Glimbeck Radio Show last week,
[4:24:58.680 --> 4:25:03.680]  I quipped in response to our wayward federal government, I may run for president of Texas.
[4:25:03.680 --> 4:25:06.680]  That may be a reality sooner than we think.
[4:25:06.680 --> 4:25:08.680]  If not for me, someone may do it, and going on.
[4:25:08.680 --> 4:25:14.680]  From the east coast to the left coast, America seems to be moving further and further from its founder's vision of government.
[4:25:14.680 --> 4:25:23.680]  Here's what Washington advised, the great rule of conduct in regard to foreign nations is extending our commercial relations
[4:25:23.680 --> 4:25:27.680]  and having them as little political connection as possible.
[4:25:27.680 --> 4:25:34.680]  Yet the Obama administration just pledged 900 million in the U.S. taxpayer fund aid to Hamas-controlled Gaza
[4:25:34.680 --> 4:25:41.680]  and Mahmoud Abbas Palestinian authorities, which is more – so that's exactly what Glimbeck does.
[4:25:41.680 --> 4:25:44.680]  We're fighting the New World Order. It's the Muslims.
[4:25:44.680 --> 4:25:49.680]  When the radical Muslims are controlled and funded, the fake al-Qaeda groups.
[4:25:49.680 --> 4:25:52.680]  Yeah, we surround them. Just click on the We Surround Them link.
[4:25:52.680 --> 4:25:58.680]  That's Glimbeck. He's going to do it on Glimbeck, I guess, today. How ridiculous.
[4:25:58.680 --> 4:26:02.680]  Glimbeck is hosting a nationwide event called We Surround Them. Go here for more information.
[4:26:02.680 --> 4:26:06.680]  So that's it. I don't know how I missed this for a day, ladies and gentlemen.
[4:26:06.680 --> 4:26:14.680]  Oh, look, it's the snake. Now, the federally written document that says Ron Paul's a terrorist that Glimbeck reads off of,
[4:26:14.680 --> 4:26:31.680]  now saying he's Glimbeck's – now saying he's Ron Paul's best friend, they show that snake right here, just another type of it.
[4:26:31.680 --> 4:26:35.680]  They show that snake and say Ron Paul's basically evil and bad.
[4:26:35.680 --> 4:26:38.680]  In fact, there's Ron Paul and Campaign for Liberty are all terrorists right here.
[4:26:38.680 --> 4:26:46.680]  So this is clearly Glimbeck. I told you weeks ago, I have a really bad feeling about Glimbeck and he's trying to become the leader of this.
[4:26:46.680 --> 4:26:50.680]  But then he always says, there's a New World Order. We've got to fight it. The Russians are going to get us.
[4:26:50.680 --> 4:26:53.680]  Like, there's a New World Order. Global banks are taking over. And it's the Russians.
[4:26:53.680 --> 4:26:56.680]  There's a New World Order. Global banks. And it's the Muslims.
[4:26:56.680 --> 4:27:05.680]  And see, that's what Chuck Norris says here. You know, I want to think Chuck is a good guy, but they know revolutions afoot against the New World Order
[4:27:05.680 --> 4:27:09.680]  and they want to control it and make it a fake right-wing thing. They can play it off the left-right paradigm.
[4:27:09.680 --> 4:27:14.680]  The only revolution that will defeat the bankers is admitting they control both parties.
[4:27:14.680 --> 4:27:20.680]  You understand that? Oh, my God. How can I even go home and see my kids? I've got to stay and work on this.
[4:27:20.680 --> 4:27:27.680]  In fact, cancel that next libertarian radio show. I'm not going on that right now. I'll have to reschedule it.
[4:27:27.680 --> 4:27:32.680]  I don't care if they don't want to have me back on. Because I've got to really analyze this and go through it.
[4:27:32.680 --> 4:27:39.680]  And now that I read, I knew I had to read his full comments. And sure enough, that's what it is.
[4:27:39.680 --> 4:27:42.680]  You know, Obama's not a traitor because he's introduced all these gun bills.
[4:27:42.680 --> 4:27:44.680]  Obama's not a traitor because he's bringing us into the New World Order.
[4:27:44.680 --> 4:27:50.680]  Obama's a traitor because they're going to give money to rebuild some sewage stuff for PR. They kill the Muslims, destroy them,
[4:27:50.680 --> 4:27:56.680]  and then come in with UN control. That's all that. It's like they bomb Serbia and then come in and take it over.
[4:27:56.680 --> 4:28:08.680]  The Muslims aren't going to get you. And the radical ones in every case are CIA-controlled.
[4:28:08.680 --> 4:28:12.680]  Patrick Henry taught us our Constitution is an instrument for its people to restrain the government.
[4:28:12.680 --> 4:28:17.680]  Yet our Congress and President stampede the founding document, overlook its explicitness and mandate,
[4:28:17.680 --> 4:28:25.680]  manipulate its words to abandon a balance of power and accommodate their own desires, partisan politics, and runaway spending.
[4:28:25.680 --> 4:28:29.680]  John Adams declared that our Constitution was made only for immoral and religious people.
[4:28:29.680 --> 4:28:36.680]  Yet we bastardize the First Amendment. It goes on to talk about Muslims.
[4:28:36.680 --> 4:28:42.680]  He makes us in. Our Bill of Rights and Constitution is under attack. Declaration of Independence is under attack. It's all under attack.
[4:28:42.680 --> 4:28:53.680]  But the Muslims are going to get it. See, it's a bait and switch. Told you that's what I saw.
[4:28:53.680 --> 4:28:57.680]  And it goes on here. He reached for the Declaration of Independence.
[4:28:57.680 --> 4:29:00.680]  When I appeared on Glimbex Radio Show, he told me that someone had asked him,
[4:29:00.680 --> 4:29:07.680]  I really believe there's going to be trouble in the future. And he answered, if this country starts to spiral out of control and Mexico melts down or whatever,
[4:29:07.680 --> 4:29:13.680]  it really starts to spiral out of control before America allows a country to become a totalitarian country,
[4:29:13.680 --> 4:29:18.680]  which it would have under, I think, Republicans as well in this situation.
[4:29:18.680 --> 4:29:24.680]  So he's being good there. They were taking us to the same place just slower. No, just as fast.
[4:29:24.680 --> 4:29:30.680]  The Republicans won't stand for it. There will be parts of this country that will rise up. Then Glimbex asked me and his listening audience,
[4:29:30.680 --> 4:29:34.680]  and where's this going to come from? He answered his own question.
[4:29:34.680 --> 4:29:39.680]  Texas, it's going to come from Texas. See, they're worried about us, folks. They're worried about Austin. They're worried about me.
[4:29:39.680 --> 4:29:45.680]  Do you agree with that, Chuck? I replied, oh, yeah, definitely.
[4:29:45.680 --> 4:29:50.680]  It was these types of thoughts that led me to utter the tongue-in-cheek frustration on Glimbex Radio Show.
[4:29:50.680 --> 4:29:57.680]  I may run for president of Texas. I'm not saying the other states won't muster the gumption to stand to secede.
[4:29:57.680 --> 4:30:01.680]  So he is doing something good here, saying the states need to stand up. It's just with Beck in the middle of it,
[4:30:01.680 --> 4:30:05.680]  and a clear intelligence operative, this thing is screwed from the get-go.
[4:30:05.680 --> 4:30:11.680]  Texas was on its, was its own country before it joined the Union in its 28th state from 1836 to 1846.
[4:30:11.680 --> 4:30:17.680]  Texas won, was its own republic. Washington on the Brazos River served as our Philadelphia.
[4:30:17.680 --> 4:30:23.680]  It was there on March 2nd, 1836, where a band of patriots forged the Texas Declaration of Independence.
[4:30:23.680 --> 4:30:28.680]  We just celebrated this date last week. Yeah, Alamo Day.
[4:30:28.680 --> 4:30:34.680]  On March 1st, 1845, then-president John Tyler signed a congressional bill annexing the Republic of Texas
[4:30:34.680 --> 4:30:39.680]  through the annex and resolution never explicitly granted Texas the right to secede from the Union,
[4:30:39.680 --> 4:30:44.680]  as is often reported. Many, including me, hold that it is implied by unique autonomy.
[4:30:44.680 --> 4:30:49.680]  Well, all the states who read the Ninth and Tenth Amendment can, can, they created the government.
[4:30:49.680 --> 4:30:54.680]  They can pull out any time. As well as the unusual provision in the resolution that gave Texas the right to
[4:30:54.680 --> 4:31:00.680]  divide into as many as five states, both the original 1836 and the current 1876 Texas Constitution
[4:31:00.680 --> 4:31:07.680]  also declared that all political power is inherent in the people, that they all, at all times,
[4:31:07.680 --> 4:31:11.680]  had an amiable right to alter their government in such a manner as they might think proper.
[4:31:11.680 --> 4:31:19.680]  Well, yeah, it's like the right to revolt article 10 of the New Hampshire Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[4:31:19.680 --> 4:31:24.680]  And he goes on to say, anyone who's been around Texas for any length of time knows exactly what we do
[4:31:24.680 --> 4:31:29.680]  if we're going, if the going got rough in America.
[4:31:29.680 --> 4:31:35.680]  But there'd be no doubt about that, as Sam Houston once said, Texas has yet to learn submission to any oppression
[4:31:35.680 --> 4:31:42.680]  come from what any source it may.
[4:31:42.680 --> 4:31:47.680]  For those losing hope and others wanting to rekindle the patriotic fires of early America,
[4:31:47.680 --> 4:31:52.680]  I encourage you to join Fox News, Glenn Beck, me, and millions of people across the country,
[4:31:52.680 --> 4:31:55.680]  saying anybody that watches is in the cell.
[4:31:55.680 --> 4:32:01.680]  In the live telecast, we surround them on Friday afternoon,
[4:32:01.680 --> 4:32:05.680]  at a certain time, that's coming up in about 30 minutes.
[4:32:05.680 --> 4:32:07.680]  We got to watch this.
[4:32:07.680 --> 4:32:14.680]  Thousands of cell groups will be united around the country in solidarity over the concerns of our nation.
[4:32:14.680 --> 4:32:18.680]  You can host or attend a viewing party by going to Glenn's website.
[4:32:18.680 --> 4:32:20.680]  God, Glenn is really trying to take over.
[4:32:20.680 --> 4:32:24.680]  My wife, Jean, I will be hosting one from our Texas Ranch,
[4:32:24.680 --> 4:32:29.680]  in which we've invited many family members and friends and law enforcement to join us.
[4:32:29.680 --> 4:32:34.680]  We're saying we're united and we're tired of corruption and we're not going to take it anymore.
[4:32:34.680 --> 4:32:36.680]  I have to reserve judgment on all this.
[4:32:36.680 --> 4:32:40.680]  I just have to say Glenn Beck's a snake and is engaged in betrayal after betrayal.
[4:32:40.680 --> 4:32:42.680]  That's why I blasted him last week.
[4:32:42.680 --> 4:32:46.680]  Again, Sam Houston put it well when he gave the marching orders.
[4:32:46.680 --> 4:32:48.680]  We view ourselves on the eve of battle.
[4:32:48.680 --> 4:32:52.680]  We are nerves for the contest and must conquer or perish.
[4:32:52.680 --> 4:32:55.680]  It is vain to look for present aid, none is at hand.
[4:32:55.680 --> 4:32:57.680]  We must now act or abandon all hope.
[4:32:57.680 --> 4:32:58.680]  That's true.
[4:32:58.680 --> 4:33:02.680]  Rally to the standard and be no longer the scoff of mercenary tongues.
[4:33:02.680 --> 4:33:03.680]  Be men.
[4:33:03.680 --> 4:33:04.680]  Be free men.
[4:33:04.680 --> 4:33:07.680]  Your children may bless their father's name.
[4:33:07.680 --> 4:33:09.680]  That your children may bless their father's name.
[4:33:18.680 --> 4:33:23.680]  I mean, this is unprecedented and I guarantee you Beck has co-opted this.
[4:33:23.680 --> 4:33:25.680]  I know some of the police that are friends with him.
[4:33:25.680 --> 4:33:28.680]  That's when they told me he was a fan 10 years ago and then I got contacted.
[4:33:28.680 --> 4:33:30.680]  But he didn't want to come on air at that time.
[4:33:30.680 --> 4:33:35.680]  I just left him alone until we got contacted by the publisher, sent us a book,
[4:33:35.680 --> 4:33:37.680]  and they said Chuck wants to come on the show.
[4:33:37.680 --> 4:33:39.680]  Then he came on and was kind of timid but said, yeah, I know things are bad.
[4:33:39.680 --> 4:33:43.680]  And then off air in a four-minute break when we said bye to him, you guys were witnesses.
[4:33:43.680 --> 4:33:44.680]  Remember?
[4:33:44.680 --> 4:33:47.680]  Remember the Chuck Norris conversation?
[4:33:47.680 --> 4:33:49.680]  And he said, oh no, I've been listening to you.
[4:33:49.680 --> 4:33:50.680]  I know it's true.
[4:33:50.680 --> 4:33:52.680]  I just don't know how I'm going to go public.
[4:33:52.680 --> 4:33:53.680]  Oh, I know.
[4:33:53.680 --> 4:33:54.680]  And I said, you know about all this stuff.
[4:33:54.680 --> 4:33:56.680]  And he goes, well, there's people working on it.
[4:33:56.680 --> 4:33:59.680]  Look, he's got all these spooks around him and all this stuff.
[4:33:59.680 --> 4:34:04.680]  And I'm not even obsessed with Chuck Norris and all the jokes they make about him.
[4:34:04.680 --> 4:34:12.680]  Chuck Norris is the wet and water, all those little jokes they tell, things like,
[4:34:12.680 --> 4:34:17.680]  when the boogeyman goes to sleep at every night, he checks under his closet for Chuck Norris.
[4:34:17.680 --> 4:34:18.680]  Chuck Norris doesn't read books.
[4:34:18.680 --> 4:34:21.680]  He stares them down until he gets the information he wants.
[4:34:21.680 --> 4:34:24.680]  Outer space exists, but it's afraid to be on the same planet with Chuck Norris.
[4:34:24.680 --> 4:34:30.680]  I mean, you know, it's that Chuck Norris, if he was to call for some type of insurrection,
[4:34:30.680 --> 4:34:32.680]  it would happen.
[4:34:32.680 --> 4:34:35.680]  And that's what the military wants and what is going on.
[4:34:35.680 --> 4:34:38.680]  But I don't think it'll be a call to action militarily.
[4:34:38.680 --> 4:34:43.680]  It's just going to be forming some new right-wing thing around the Republicans to then, you know,
[4:34:43.680 --> 4:34:46.680]  go after Russia and the Muslims.
[4:34:46.680 --> 4:34:53.680]  I noticed this like six, seven years ago from Michael Weiner Savage,
[4:34:53.680 --> 4:34:57.680]  the Beatnik poet of the 60s, top Beatnik, now conservative,
[4:34:57.680 --> 4:35:00.680]  is he would say, we got to fight the New World Order, the Muslims of the New World Order.
[4:35:00.680 --> 4:35:01.680]  They want global government.
[4:35:01.680 --> 4:35:04.680]  And sure, I mean, I guess some of them do want their own jihad-world government,
[4:35:04.680 --> 4:35:05.680]  but they don't have the power.
[4:35:05.680 --> 4:35:09.680]  I mean, the point is, that's not what the banks are and who's stealing from us and who's ruling us.
[4:35:09.680 --> 4:35:12.680]  And he would go, got to fight the international crime syndicate or the Muslims,
[4:35:12.680 --> 4:35:14.680]  and then they're with the New World Order.
[4:35:14.680 --> 4:35:17.680]  The Democrats work with the Muslims in the New World Order.
[4:35:17.680 --> 4:35:21.680]  And then, you know, I watch Beckins like, yeah, the FEMA camps are being built and it's really bad.
[4:35:21.680 --> 4:35:22.680]  And it's the Russians.
[4:35:22.680 --> 4:35:24.680]  We got out of the Russians are about to nuke us.
[4:35:24.680 --> 4:35:26.680]  You know, he mixes it all together.
[4:35:26.680 --> 4:35:30.680]  It's everybody concerned with the truth because it's all rising right now.
[4:35:30.680 --> 4:35:32.680]  I told you this is big, folks.
[4:35:32.680 --> 4:35:33.680]  It's huge.
[4:35:33.680 --> 4:35:37.680]  We're winning, but we knew crap like this would get pulled.
[4:35:37.680 --> 4:35:44.680]  That insincere, fake, little demonic weasel, Glenn Beck.
[4:35:44.680 --> 4:35:45.680]  God help us.
[4:35:45.680 --> 4:35:50.680]  We're in for one amazing ride here.
[4:35:50.680 --> 4:35:51.680]  Well, this thing's about to start.
[4:35:51.680 --> 4:35:53.680]  I got to go send an email to Chuck Norris.
[4:35:53.680 --> 4:35:56.680]  I need to stay more in contact with people like this.
[4:35:56.680 --> 4:36:04.680]  And I'll probably be on Burma's show tonight covering this.
[4:36:04.680 --> 4:36:09.680]  Let me check my interview times.
[4:36:09.680 --> 4:36:15.680]  I don't understand why it doesn't have the other interview on here.
[4:36:15.680 --> 4:36:17.680]  Oh, there's nothing I can do about it.
[4:36:17.680 --> 4:36:18.680]  It doesn't matter.
[4:36:18.680 --> 4:36:22.680]  And I'll continue to try to track this.
[4:36:22.680 --> 4:36:27.680]  We'll get a blur about about this or something at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[4:36:27.680 --> 4:36:33.680]  Notice, again, we need to have the viral movement on the Obama deception which exposes Bush and Obama as puppets of the bankers.
[4:36:33.680 --> 4:36:35.680]  They're the new world order.
[4:36:35.680 --> 4:36:41.680]  Keep getting the Obama deception out on all of the cedars, all of the BitTorrents, everything.
[4:36:41.680 --> 4:36:43.680]  It's all over the web for free, folks.
[4:36:43.680 --> 4:36:49.680]  And the problem is people were so greedy to get it up quickly that they would do low res uploads to YouTube.
[4:36:49.680 --> 4:36:50.680]  It looks like total crap.
[4:36:50.680 --> 4:36:53.680]  And we're trying to find a free one to link to that looks good and we haven't found them.
[4:36:53.680 --> 4:36:57.680]  It looks so good on the DevX and all the other copies we have at prisonplanet.tv.
[4:36:57.680 --> 4:36:59.680]  $5.95 that funds us.
[4:36:59.680 --> 4:37:00.680]  Go sign up at prisonplanet.tv.
[4:37:00.680 --> 4:37:01.680]  Make copies of it.
[4:37:01.680 --> 4:37:02.680]  Burn it to disk.
[4:37:02.680 --> 4:37:04.680]  Get it out to everybody you know.
[4:37:04.680 --> 4:37:06.680]  This has got to go supernova.
[4:37:06.680 --> 4:37:08.680]  You know what I'm talking about?
[4:37:08.680 --> 4:37:10.680]  Revolution exploding any day now.
[4:37:10.680 --> 4:37:11.680]  We don't want that.
[4:37:11.680 --> 4:37:17.680]  We want to keep building and waking people up so it can be peaceful or when the enemy strikes and goes ahead and starts the hot war.
[4:37:17.680 --> 4:37:19.680]  So many troops and military are awake.
[4:37:19.680 --> 4:37:20.680]  This doesn't happen.
[4:37:20.680 --> 4:37:21.680]  And this may be positive.
[4:37:21.680 --> 4:37:22.680]  This may wake up the police and military.
[4:37:22.680 --> 4:37:26.680]  They'll just think Glenn Beck is their leader and is going to save them.
[4:37:26.680 --> 4:37:28.680]  See how sophisticated that is?
[4:37:28.680 --> 4:37:33.680]  This is a sigh up folks and I don't know if Chuck Norris is involved in it but I'm going to ask him.
[4:37:33.680 --> 4:37:35.680]  I'm going to ask him right now.
[4:37:35.680 --> 4:37:36.680]  All right.
[4:37:36.680 --> 4:37:41.680]  We'll go back into the retransmission at FullWars.com until 9 to midnight this evening.
[4:37:41.680 --> 4:37:44.680]  I know a lot of listeners know Chuck Norris.
[4:37:44.680 --> 4:37:45.680]  Police officers or friends with him.
[4:37:45.680 --> 4:37:47.680]  You're probably at his house right now or driving up to it.
[4:37:47.680 --> 4:37:57.680]  Call us here at the office 512-291-5787 or 512-291-5750 and get us in touch with Chuck because I didn't ask him for his number for some reason.
[4:37:57.680 --> 4:37:59.680]  When he gave me his cell phone, I don't push these guys.
[4:37:59.680 --> 4:38:02.680]  I need to get a hold of him right now.
[4:38:02.680 --> 4:38:03.680]  All right.
[4:38:03.680 --> 4:38:04.680]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[4:38:04.680 --> 4:38:06.680]  Back to retransmission at FullWars.com.
[4:38:06.680 --> 4:38:11.680]  Please spread the word that we're going to analyze this and tell you the truth about what Glenn Beck is up to with Chuck Norris.
[4:38:11.680 --> 4:38:27.680]  God bless you all.
