[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:30.560]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:30.560 --> 00:41.200]  central focus is the fact that the single biggest threat to US security both short
[00:41.200 --> 00:45.760]  term medium-term and long-term would be the possibility of a terrorist
[00:45.760 --> 00:53.240]  organization obtaining a nuclear weapon this is something that could change the
[00:53.240 --> 00:57.200]  security landscape in this country around the world for years to come if
[00:57.200 --> 01:04.000]  there was ever a detonation in a New York City or London or Johannesburg the
[01:04.000 --> 01:10.400]  ramifications economically politically security perspective would be
[01:10.400 --> 01:16.160]  devastating we know that organizations like al-qaeda are in the process of
[01:16.160 --> 01:25.040]  trying to secure no compunction at using unfortunately we have a situation in
[01:25.040 --> 01:31.600]  which there is a lot of loose nuclear material around the world and so the
[01:31.600 --> 01:38.040]  central focus goal of this is getting the international community on a cap in
[01:38.040 --> 01:44.240]  which we are locking down that material in a very specific time frame with a
[01:44.240 --> 01:48.400]  specific work plan and one of the things that I'm very pleased about is that
[01:48.400 --> 01:53.640]  countries have embraced this goal and they're coming to this summit all right
[01:53.640 --> 01:58.040]  that was president Obama last night he's out giving basically the same
[01:58.040 --> 02:03.360]  talking points today I want to break down right out of the gates today all
[02:03.360 --> 02:09.800]  the different angles of this they have several past to global governance one
[02:09.800 --> 02:13.960]  of them is fake environmental hype saying if you don't allow central banks
[02:13.960 --> 02:18.400]  to run your life control who can have a job who can have a factory who can have
[02:18.400 --> 02:25.040]  a fireplace who can have an outdoor space heater home inspections what type of
[02:25.040 --> 02:30.640]  car you can have that's one path of total control and new secret White House
[02:30.640 --> 02:35.360]  documents have been leaked this is confirmed mainstream newspapers London
[02:35.360 --> 02:43.160]  Guardian AP Fox News new secret documents about how now last year we got the UN
[02:43.160 --> 02:47.200]  secret documents saying it was for global government and a covert stealth
[02:47.200 --> 02:52.640]  program to establish world government through fake environmentalism I mean
[02:52.640 --> 02:55.480]  they know it's fake they know the glaciers are getting bigger they know
[02:55.480 --> 02:59.280]  there's more polar bears they know the earth's cooling of course they're cold
[02:59.280 --> 03:04.000]  blooded liars I mean let's get that straight these are not tree hugging tree
[03:04.000 --> 03:10.720]  petting dolphin kissing idiots now their minions are and so we got the UN
[03:10.720 --> 03:16.520]  documents last year and this is mirrored the new White House documents that some
[03:16.520 --> 03:22.680]  idiot White House employee or maybe they're a patriot left on a hotel
[03:22.680 --> 03:30.360]  computer and it is basically word for word what we saw last year in the leaked
[03:30.360 --> 03:38.480]  text because the treaty was secret can't have the public seeing that the the
[03:38.480 --> 03:44.880]  Copenhagen Treaty got out that was a set up world government and this is a
[03:44.880 --> 03:49.040]  White House memo admitting that this is the total transfer of our sovereignty
[03:49.040 --> 03:52.840]  and the and every other nation's sovereignty to the private oligarchs to
[03:52.840 --> 03:57.000]  the bankers now why am I getting into that when I'm talking about nukes loose
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.680]  nukes well it's the same thing Club of Rome said back in the 60s and again in
[04:01.680 --> 04:05.160]  91 we've quoted them many times here they published this they're not hiding it
[04:05.160 --> 04:08.800]  they said we'll use the threat of terrorism from one angle to enslave
[04:08.800 --> 04:12.240]  people and we'll use the threat of environmental crises from the other
[04:12.240 --> 04:18.120]  angle in a pincer attack and so when you hear about oh the UN's got to have all
[04:18.120 --> 04:22.880]  this power and oh we've got to invade Iran and oh my gosh Al Qaeda's gonna nuke
[04:22.880 --> 04:30.060]  us any minute we better invade Iran and nukes are gonna go off in the US or go
[04:30.060 --> 04:34.600]  off in any city we've got to lock everybody down have mobile naked body
[04:34.600 --> 04:38.440]  scanners and blood testing and checkpoints and secret arrest and
[04:38.440 --> 04:43.040]  camps anybody could have a nuke unlike anybody can make the most weaponized
[04:43.040 --> 04:46.920]  anthrax in world history in a bathtub they said and it turned out of course
[04:46.920 --> 04:52.000]  the Pentagon boys and CIA were mailing that out so this is serious they're
[04:52.000 --> 04:56.140]  getting ready to play the nuclear terror card we'll break it down on the other

[08:05.760 --> 08:08.600]  radio network
[08:08.600 --> 08:22.640]  okay the top issue is the international community i.e. the private central banks
[08:22.640 --> 08:27.960]  engage in a hostile takeover of every nation on the planet are now playing the
[08:27.960 --> 08:35.080]  nuclear terror card now we saw this in 2002 2003 in the run-up to the Iraq
[08:35.080 --> 08:40.200]  illegal invasion and we're now seeing them just put out this nebulous threat
[08:40.200 --> 08:43.680]  that al-qaeda is going to get nukes and they're going to attack us and we've got
[08:43.680 --> 08:48.000]  to strengthen world government in every nation and put a police state in to
[08:48.000 --> 08:54.960]  protect you from nukes and I've told you that in their fist is the false flag
[08:54.960 --> 08:59.200]  nuclear attack now they can just threaten the attack that's a psychological
[08:59.200 --> 09:02.600]  false flag governor ridge head of homeland security last year wrote a
[09:02.600 --> 09:06.600]  book admitted what we already knew that they were issuing terror alerts for
[09:06.600 --> 09:10.040]  political gain and for political distractions by the way that's a
[09:10.040 --> 09:13.760]  violation of a whole bunch of different federal laws and the patriot act has a
[09:13.760 --> 09:19.400]  provision of you issue a fake terror alert or a fake terror bomb threat it's a
[09:19.400 --> 09:24.040]  very serious felony but when government does it it's okay and so when you look
[09:24.040 --> 09:29.200]  at all the real evidence yes some rogue group can make a dirty bomb but not an
[09:29.200 --> 09:36.040]  atomic bomb not a hydrogen bomb this is like the government claiming that it
[09:36.040 --> 09:39.640]  was made in a bathtub or in a bucket and that it was just run-of-the-mill
[09:39.640 --> 09:45.200]  anthrax and of course we had all these medical doctors and biological weapons
[09:45.200 --> 09:51.680]  experts on back in 2001 2002 pointing out that this stuff was some of the most
[09:51.680 --> 09:57.080]  weaponized anthrax ever seen and it's now come out that it is so advanced
[09:57.080 --> 10:04.680]  nothing was even in existence pre-911 it was classified that there was
[10:04.680 --> 10:11.480]  something this deadly a US government strain miniaturized weaponized to a
[10:11.480 --> 10:15.240]  level that would take hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[10:15.240 --> 10:19.200]  millions of dollars of equipment to make and that not even the Russians or the
[10:19.200 --> 10:23.920]  British or the Chinese could make this only the United States had the
[10:23.920 --> 10:28.720]  technology to make it and they blamed what three different patsies and then
[10:28.720 --> 10:31.960]  they grabbed one and killed him in government custody and that was only a
[10:31.960 --> 10:35.960]  minor footnote that he died in custody it just said in the news he committed
[10:35.960 --> 10:42.120]  suicide and now it's come out that he was framed but I'm look I'm already
[10:42.120 --> 10:48.800]  digressing this is such a big deal though to have Obama now playing the
[10:48.800 --> 10:54.400]  nuke card and so I'm going to walk through that first but let me before I do
[10:54.400 --> 11:03.120]  that tell you about some of the other important news that is coming up here on
[11:03.120 --> 11:11.920]  this radio broadcast today leaked US document calls for global regime global
[11:11.920 --> 11:17.240]  government to tackle climate change Steve Watson published this last night at
[11:17.240 --> 11:24.080]  prisonplanet.com very important article and again US newspapers British
[11:24.080 --> 11:30.560]  newspapers are reporting it is authentic and the White House is upset that this
[11:30.560 --> 11:37.280]  got out now they're spinning it saying it was left on a hotel computer but a lot
[11:37.280 --> 11:42.600]  of watchdogs and leak experts believe this was leaked to the media we know
[11:42.600 --> 11:47.920]  climate gate was leaked two years before it broke a year before it broke six
[11:47.920 --> 11:52.680]  months two months the week of and that the French media the British media the
[11:52.680 --> 12:02.120]  US media the Japanese media everyone was sent this information they were all
[12:02.120 --> 12:08.840]  sent the dossiers they were all sent computer files disk of the climate gate
[12:08.840 --> 12:16.320]  correspondence and email and it was suppressed they suppressed the Copenhagen
[12:16.320 --> 12:21.520]  Treaty they would not let the public see it and a week into the conference known
[12:21.520 --> 12:29.120]  as the Danish text because it was it was leaked through Danish channels the full
[12:29.120 --> 12:35.200]  text of the secret treaty and said world government shut down industrial
[12:35.200 --> 12:41.240]  society hundreds of new taxes value-added taxes sales taxes carbon
[12:41.240 --> 12:46.520]  taxes home inspections shutting down factories total control all paid to
[12:46.520 --> 12:51.440]  private central banks no one signed the treaty and so Obama and Gordon Brown
[12:51.440 --> 12:55.600]  and others said we'll just have the central banks levy the taxes through the
[12:55.600 --> 12:58.440]  Treasury departments that will just give them the money and we're going to do
[12:58.440 --> 13:02.040]  this regardless nothing to do with the environment is giving themselves
[13:02.040 --> 13:06.240]  trillions and now they're announcing it again so this is a very important
[13:06.240 --> 13:10.520]  document also dealing with the banks looting people that's all this is a new
[13:10.520 --> 13:17.040]  regulation tax system the likes of which humanity has never seen remember
[13:17.040 --> 13:21.360]  Bloomberg a month ago and we've been hammering this every day and now
[13:21.360 --> 13:27.120]  world net daily and now other Obama officials are saying yes we're going to
[13:27.120 --> 13:30.600]  take your pension funds and the first group they're going to take our
[13:30.600 --> 13:35.960]  government pension funds state county city and federal the government says
[13:35.960 --> 13:41.680]  they're going to take it and quote invest it in failed banks that's a quote
[13:41.680 --> 13:49.000]  take your money take it and they're debating whether they'll just take all
[13:49.000 --> 13:55.120]  of your money or whether they will take it and then hold it and then give you a
[13:55.120 --> 13:59.720]  small stipend of your own money this is money you've already paid taxes on this
[13:59.720 --> 14:04.840]  is money you've you've invested this is your money but the federal regulators

[14:08.960 --> 14:15.600]  and Greece and Germany and France and Argentina everywhere else and they are
[14:15.600 --> 14:19.760]  saying you're going to give us pension funds okay now here is the London
[14:19.760 --> 14:26.920]  Telegraph today Ambrose Evans Pritchard in the economics section headline
[14:26.920 --> 14:35.440]  Argentina seizes pension funds to pay debts who is next and that segues into
[14:35.440 --> 14:39.880]  money news reporting key Fed and Treasury action shrouded in government
[14:39.880 --> 14:46.040]  secrecy and that integrates into this next story LA Times health care

[15:16.520 --> 15:19.960]  country they're announcing four day a week school days they're telling
[15:19.960 --> 15:26.000]  government employees from state police to department of transportation in
[15:26.000 --> 15:31.600]  California many other states they're laying off more than half the sheriff's
[15:31.600 --> 15:35.480]  deputies in many counties and they're just saying hey we're raising all your
[15:35.480 --> 15:40.120]  taxes and we're not filling potholes and we're getting rid of the cops you like
[15:40.120 --> 15:45.000]  that hope you enjoy it and the cops that are left well they're going to be
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.160]  revenue generating that was in the AP two weeks ago their main job now it's
[15:50.160 --> 15:54.160]  admitted they've got quotas after decades of lying about it now it's admitted
[15:54.160 --> 15:59.800]  hey we're not here to respond to your 911 call lady okay buy a gun and that's
[15:59.800 --> 16:05.360]  what's amazing in Ohio in Texas in Michigan even in upstate New York I'm
[16:05.360 --> 16:09.560]  seeing articles every day where the sheriffs and police departments are
[16:09.560 --> 16:15.160]  saying look we can't protect you buy guns and I salute them for being honest
[16:15.160 --> 16:19.080]  at least they've got some conscience notice you don't hear the feds saying
[16:19.080 --> 16:22.840]  that though but better police departments better sheriff's departments are
[16:22.840 --> 16:29.880]  saying look look we cannot protect you buy a gun so this is a big wake-up call
[16:29.880 --> 16:34.640]  for people I mean we're beginning to enter this road warrior scenario I mean
[16:34.640 --> 16:38.960]  how do you think they live in Argentina how did they live in Nigeria people always
[16:38.960 --> 16:43.000]  make fun of these third-world countries and call them idiots Argentina well
[16:43.000 --> 16:49.240]  100 years ago and per capita was more wealthy than the average US citizen a
[16:49.240 --> 16:55.600]  heaven it was it was the old saying as rich as an Argentine not anymore it's
[16:55.600 --> 16:58.840]  not because they're stupid it's not because they're lazy people in Latin
[16:58.840 --> 17:02.440]  America are hard-working and smart people in Africa and many nations are
[17:02.440 --> 17:06.440]  hard-working and extremely smart they've had corruption in place people in
[17:06.440 --> 17:09.960]  Mexico are smart but they've never had a free government they've never had a
[17:09.960 --> 17:13.440]  chance to build something on their own it's all a bunch of strong men all a
[17:13.440 --> 17:18.800]  bunch of king rats running it they never had founding fathers they never had a
[17:18.800 --> 17:24.720]  1776 that's why we were so special it only happened here one time one time to
[17:24.720 --> 17:28.440]  we get leaders who weren't totally corrupt they weren't perfect but compared
[17:28.440 --> 17:31.480]  to what the rest of the world has these were some of the greatest people to ever
[17:31.480 --> 17:40.680]  live okay I'm ranting here I just watching my country and the world itself
[17:40.680 --> 17:45.640]  being looted and robbed by design and wrecked on the rocks of big government
[17:45.640 --> 17:55.360]  by design so we can be looted tears my heart out and it's only gonna get worse
[17:55.360 --> 18:01.120]  and worse and worse and we're going into a socially engineered society run by a
[18:01.120 --> 18:06.720]  bunch of control freaks that hate their fellow man so I'm going to go through
[18:06.720 --> 18:13.160]  the economic news I just mentioned in more detail coming up Obama has bowed

[24:40.160 --> 24:44.200]  live thank you for joining us
[24:44.200 --> 24:57.800]  okay number one we know the Pentagon since the 40s 50s 60s 70s and 80s and
[24:57.800 --> 25:03.320]  right through to today to create a culture of fears the American people
[25:03.320 --> 25:07.560]  would allow the military industrial complex to grow and take over society
[25:07.560 --> 25:12.520]  would have duck and cover nuke drills telling people to jump underneath their
[25:12.520 --> 25:16.360]  desk to scare them now in countries like Switzerland where they actually care
[25:16.360 --> 25:20.720]  about their population they built redoubts or underground fortresses keeps
[25:20.720 --> 25:26.640]  where their entire population in every town big city small towns didn't matter
[25:26.640 --> 25:32.680]  have underground bases and weapons grenade launchers hand grenades machine
[25:32.680 --> 25:40.280]  guns heavy machine guns light machine guns assault rifles hand guns but here
[25:40.280 --> 25:44.240]  they just fear mongered and scared everybody and said oh your nuclear
[25:44.240 --> 25:49.920]  fallout shelter is a city parking garage growing up in Dallas and they still
[25:49.920 --> 25:53.880]  have them it will say this parking garage is designated as a nuclear fallout
[25:53.880 --> 25:57.880]  shelter that's where you go to die you you they don't tell you to get potassium
[25:57.880 --> 26:01.800]  iodine they don't tell you how to protect yourself they just say you crawl in
[26:01.800 --> 26:07.400]  here and we'll come clean you out later meanwhile the Pentagon has reported the
[26:07.400 --> 26:12.040]  British Ministry of Defense has reported neocon cheney wrote this was even
[26:12.040 --> 26:17.000]  picked up by the statesman one time here in Austin that neutron bombs or race
[26:17.000 --> 26:22.000]  specific bio weapons may be used against the population globally so we have a
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.640]  government developing and deploying neutron bombs that just create a
[26:25.640 --> 26:29.480]  radiation burst they don't destroy buildings to kill us and producing
[26:29.480 --> 26:34.880]  biological weapons to kill us designed and targeted and they mix soft killed
[26:34.880 --> 26:40.880]  slow killed weapons in the vaccines by what that's another subject this is the
[26:40.880 --> 26:44.960]  Daily Mail we blundered over swine flu admit health chiefs admit the whole
[26:44.960 --> 26:48.360]  thing was fake turned out they were all paid off to do it proven right again but
[26:48.360 --> 26:52.840]  that's coming up now they didn't blunder they made tens of billions of
[26:52.840 --> 26:57.200]  dollars and got people to take that cancer virus mercury filled injection and
[26:57.200 --> 27:01.280]  five major studies out by governments and universities in the last month
[27:01.280 --> 27:04.800]  admitting that if you took the seasonal flu shot it was filled with with the
[27:04.800 --> 27:08.960]  H1N1 and that gave it to you of course we read the ingredients of the seasonal
[27:08.960 --> 27:13.880]  and notice that and warn people but you know we're still the bad guys though I
[27:13.880 --> 27:18.120]  but I'm sorry I'm just integrating this all in together so we have a group of
[27:18.120 --> 27:22.240]  international eugenicist criminals that think of us as trash and garbage a
[27:22.240 --> 27:29.000]  bunch of social engineers playing gods up on Mount Olympus and we're just the
[27:29.000 --> 27:32.480]  mere mortals down here in their engineered society and now most the TV
[27:32.480 --> 27:37.320]  most of the print media is behavior placement brainwashing placement
[27:37.320 --> 27:41.640]  propaganda placement with just all the messages paid for by the government
[27:41.640 --> 27:46.760]  anti-family anti-gun anti-founding father anti-freedom we live in a
[27:46.760 --> 27:50.240]  propaganda state we know they issue fake terror alerts we know the government
[27:50.240 --> 27:54.760]  launched the anthrax attacks we know they lied about WMD's premeditatedly
[27:54.760 --> 27:58.240]  they weren't wrong about it we have the White House and Downing Street memos
[27:58.240 --> 28:04.080]  they lied they knew Saddam wasn't involved with Al Qaeda they know they'd
[28:04.080 --> 28:07.920]  used Al Qaeda to try to overthrow him they know that he was secular and that
[28:07.920 --> 28:12.040]  they were Wahhabist out of Saudi Arabia they know all that and they lied and
[28:12.040 --> 28:16.480]  said he made New England in 45 minutes remember Tony Blair they lied about that
[28:16.480 --> 28:21.320]  before and then in the 2004 election Cheney told US News and World Report that
[28:21.320 --> 28:24.640]  he believed there would be a nuclear attack by Al Qaeda and that it was going
[28:24.640 --> 28:30.120]  to happen and that they better reelect Bush to respond to the nuclear attack so
[28:30.120 --> 28:33.800]  we know these are the tactics that government uses we know Governor Ridge
[28:33.800 --> 28:39.880]  is on record saying they were issuing fake terror alerts for political gain
[28:39.880 --> 28:44.360]  even Ari Fleischer White House Press Secretary and Reuters and AP back in
[28:44.360 --> 28:48.200]  2005 said we're issuing these for political gain I guess to cover himself
[28:48.200 --> 28:51.640]  from the crimes that were being committed he even told the press corps this
[28:51.640 --> 28:55.440]  in a press conference but now it's admitted not just the press secretary
[28:55.440 --> 29:01.000]  but the head of Homeland Security said this okay so we know governments do
[29:01.000 --> 29:04.920]  this we know the very same neocon operatives run the Defense Department
[29:04.920 --> 29:09.120]  still run the White House the very same banks run the White House no difference
[29:09.120 --> 29:13.720]  with Obama just different rhetoric but now the rhetoric isn't even different
[29:13.720 --> 29:26.480]  now it is the same rhetoric on nukes and Obama comes out and says state to
[29:26.480 --> 29:32.560]  state war nuclear exchanges are not the threat anymore the major threat the
[29:32.560 --> 29:40.120]  number one threat to the United States is Al CIA to setting off a new now they
[29:40.120 --> 29:44.160]  could just be fear mongering which is a form of psychological terror it is
[29:44.160 --> 29:47.920]  terrorism by its definition but I'm telling you they are more than capable
[29:47.920 --> 29:55.440]  of setting a new cough we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones

[33:00.320 --> 33:13.600]  okay I want to play just part of Obama's comments and then read through some of
[33:13.600 --> 33:19.360]  the text of it and then I want to go point by point through the nuclear
[33:19.360 --> 33:26.920]  terror card they're now playing and it makes sense for the globalist to set
[33:26.920 --> 33:33.160]  off a nuke in a major city in the west or to bust some patsies who supposedly
[33:33.160 --> 33:44.520]  have a nuke as a pretext to basically start world war 3 and we have Medvedev
[33:44.520 --> 33:49.640]  the Russian president says Israel strike on Iran could spark global
[33:49.640 --> 33:56.600]  catastrophe so this is the run-up to what could be world war 3 we've been
[33:56.600 --> 34:02.760]  hearing about that for 50 years for more than 50 years but now all of the
[34:02.760 --> 34:12.160]  pieces of the puzzle are in place for a final mega war to truly bring in
[34:12.160 --> 34:17.200]  global despotism and tyranny the likes of which the planet has never seen and
[34:17.200 --> 34:22.800]  simultaneously there will be staged terror attacks in the west to be blamed
[34:22.800 --> 34:29.760]  on domestic groups you heard Colonel Schaefer CIA trained black ops commander
[34:29.760 --> 34:35.840]  yesterday saying yes much of the anti-terror apparatus is now pointed
[34:35.840 --> 34:43.080]  at the American people black ops Pentagon operators private contractors
[34:43.080 --> 34:52.280]  foreign intelligence agencies so I want to try to lay this out but first let's
[34:52.280 --> 35:04.240]  play this clip of Obama talking about the number one threat to the US is non-state
[35:04.240 --> 35:09.840]  actors with nuclear weapons here's the headline out of USA today Obama nuclear
[35:09.840 --> 35:14.800]  terrorism is the single biggest threat to US here's a newsweek headline
[35:14.800 --> 35:19.920]  refocused as the headline the real nuclear issue isn't arms reduction it's
[35:19.920 --> 35:23.960]  loose nukes and there's another quote I heard on MPR this morning driving into
[35:23.960 --> 35:27.480]  work I guess a new one he's given another speech today we're trying to find it
[35:27.480 --> 35:37.280]  and he said the main threat is not country to country nuclear war by the
[35:37.280 --> 35:44.280]  way that is the main threat it's terrorist with nukes and that's what
[35:44.280 --> 35:52.080]  the newsweek article today is reporting on meanwhile there's the elephant in the
[35:52.080 --> 35:55.920]  room Israel with all these nuclear weapons in a meeting with Obama and
[35:55.920 --> 36:01.640]  Benjamin Netanyahu saying Iran must meet nuclear deadline I mean it's
[36:01.640 --> 36:06.400]  ridiculous so we're gonna cover that and then go to your phone calls here in
[36:06.400 --> 36:09.920]  just a moment but but here is Obama in a speech last night
[36:09.920 --> 36:16.960]  central focus of this nuclear site is the fact that the single biggest threat
[36:16.960 --> 36:22.920]  to US security for short-term medium-term and long-term would be the
[36:22.920 --> 36:29.600]  possibility of terrorist organization of taking a nuclear weapon this is
[36:29.600 --> 36:34.120]  something that could change the security landscape in this country around the
[36:34.120 --> 36:39.520]  world for years to come if there was ever a fed nation in a New York City or
[36:39.520 --> 36:48.240]  London or Johannesburg the ramifications economically politically security
[36:48.240 --> 36:53.320]  perspective would be devastating and we know that organizations like al-qaeda
[36:53.320 --> 36:58.400]  are in the process of trying to secure nuclear weapons or other weapons of
[36:58.400 --> 37:02.920]  mass destruction and there's no compunction at using them unfortunately we
[37:02.920 --> 37:08.520]  have a situation in which there is a lot of loose nuclear material around the
[37:08.520 --> 37:15.240]  world and so the central focus goal of this song is getting the international
[37:15.240 --> 37:21.360]  community on a path in which we are locking down that material in a very
[37:21.360 --> 37:25.920]  specific time frame with a specific work plan and one of the things that I'm
[37:25.920 --> 37:30.400]  very pleased about is that countries that embrace this role and they're
[37:30.400 --> 37:35.400]  coming to this summit not just talking about general statements all right look
[37:35.400 --> 37:43.880]  support you mean like the loose nukes from my not in the Dakotas being flown
[37:43.880 --> 37:54.120]  down to Louisiana on board those b-52s you mean missing nukes like that so we
[37:54.120 --> 37:58.000]  hear Obama talking about a massive change that would happen if a nuke went
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.120]  off in New York City yeah the change would be they could then push through
[38:02.120 --> 38:05.960]  their naked body scanners their secret arrest their shutdown of the internet
[38:05.960 --> 38:12.000]  their takeover of the free press massive tax increases launching new wars then
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.960]  people won't be talking about the banks stealing 50 trillion globally 28 plus
[38:16.960 --> 38:20.960]  trillion in the US people won't be talking about the banks moving to take
[38:20.960 --> 38:26.640]  your private pension funds if a nuke goes off you have to understand when
[38:26.640 --> 38:32.240]  they're talking about Al Qaeda and how Al Qaeda is ruthless and Al Qaeda will use
[38:32.240 --> 38:37.760]  nuclear weapons they're talking about themselves they are the terrorist they
[38:37.760 --> 38:42.120]  play the part of the terrorist and as the saviors this is the global management
[38:42.120 --> 38:46.960]  geopolitical system Al Qaeda was created by our government it's being used
[38:46.960 --> 38:53.000]  against Iran publicly while they then claim that Al Qaeda is going to nuke
[38:53.000 --> 39:03.960]  the United States it is Al C.I. Aida and when they talk about a regime a global
[39:03.960 --> 39:08.520]  government a quote locking it down that means a surveillance system of
[39:08.520 --> 39:13.960]  everything you do that's already in place now it's just coming out into the
[39:13.960 --> 39:19.000]  open this is a criminal global corporate state menacing us with the threat of
[39:19.000 --> 39:26.600]  nukes and the possible deployment of nukes and then of course there is a new
[39:26.600 --> 39:41.440]  movie coming out with Samuel L. Jackson where they torture someone for weeks and
[39:41.440 --> 39:46.680]  how it's wonderful that Samuel L. Jackson is torturing the terrorists the
[39:46.680 --> 39:52.640]  terrorists has planted three nukes in the US that are going to go off and he
[39:52.640 --> 39:58.320]  won't say where they are so you also have all this hype in media and they
[39:58.320 --> 40:03.960]  have these war the worlds type specials on Nightline and CNN and Fox where they
[40:03.960 --> 40:09.160]  announced at the first that it's just a drill a simulation but then they know
[40:09.160 --> 40:12.680]  that most their viewers will be channel surfing and tuning in during the next
[40:12.680 --> 40:17.400]  30 minutes to an hour believing it's real like last month Georgia announced
[40:17.400 --> 40:21.880]  Russia had attacked it was a hoax two years ago was a hoax this time a
[40:21.880 --> 40:28.720]  complete hoax but they just announced it this is all psychological warfare open
[40:28.720 --> 40:40.640]  programming against society they know what they're doing they understand what
[40:40.640 --> 40:49.840]  they're doing they have a game plan and when Obama says that the number one
[40:49.840 --> 40:56.720]  nuke threat is al Qaeda or non-state actors that's just not true you have
[40:56.720 --> 41:03.760]  the Western powers and NATO the United States England Israel and others in
[41:03.760 --> 41:11.000]  circling China in circling Russia moving weapons systems in you had them
[41:11.000 --> 41:27.360]  launch an attack on 888 on South Ossetia and Abkhazia in an attempt to get a
[41:27.360 --> 41:32.160]  military response from the Russians that Dick Cheney it's now been declassified
[41:32.160 --> 41:37.240]  wanted to lead to nuclear war I mean these are people that live in the
[41:37.240 --> 41:42.080]  underground bunkers you know Cheney spent half his time in site R and now we
[41:42.080 --> 41:47.360]  know why he had Navy SEALs preparing an attack on US ships to start a war with
[41:47.360 --> 41:53.160]  Iran which all of the experts who've looked at a degree could easily lead to
[41:53.160 --> 42:07.120]  world war 3 now Curt Nemo has an article up on info wars calm unthinkable new
[42:07.120 --> 42:15.600]  movie promotes torture and nuclear false flag terrorism and I want to play the
[42:15.600 --> 42:19.440]  audio of this now later when we're live at prison planet TV I'm gonna play the
[42:19.440 --> 42:25.040]  video but it's an article up on info wars calm and this is the behavior
[42:25.040 --> 42:30.240]  placement guaranteed paid for by the government it's now admitted in even the
[42:30.240 --> 42:33.200]  Wall Street Journal they call it behavior placement I call it propaganda
[42:33.200 --> 42:38.840]  placement or brainwashing placement this is to create fear and to create the
[42:38.840 --> 42:43.520]  perception because the average American is in a lackadaisical mesmerized
[42:43.520 --> 42:49.640]  dream state where TV and movies and video games all of it just runs together
[42:49.640 --> 42:54.640]  and they just halfway pay attention to the news halfway pay attention to the
[42:54.640 --> 42:58.520]  newspaper and they just hear Al Qaeda's got nukes they're gonna attack us
[42:58.520 --> 43:02.480]  they're working with Iran we've got to have a global system to stop this we've
[43:02.480 --> 43:05.960]  got to have checkpoints we've got to have mobile naked body scanners we've got
[43:05.960 --> 43:09.720]  to interrogate our neighbors we've got a spy on everybody we've got to let the
[43:09.720 --> 43:13.920]  bankers pass all these new taxes we've got to pass the carbon taxes or the ice
[43:13.920 --> 43:19.640]  caps will melt and we'll all drowned and you know we we've got to give up our
[43:19.640 --> 43:23.920]  rights of the terrorist will attack us I mean it is obvious as the nose on your
[43:23.920 --> 43:27.960]  face and then we have all the documents that they are premeditatedly
[43:27.960 --> 43:32.440]  terrorizing us we have a terrorist government we have an illegitimate
[43:32.440 --> 43:38.640]  criminal global corporate state and now Obama is running around saying the
[43:38.640 --> 43:44.440]  number one threat is nukes going off in the US but when we get the internal
[43:44.440 --> 43:49.440]  Homeland Security documents from Bush and Obama during their administrations
[43:49.440 --> 43:55.120]  the real threat what they're as busy as beavers are as busy as bees in the
[43:55.120 --> 44:00.080]  springtime running around like they're building the Death Star or something
[44:00.080 --> 44:04.760]  spending all their time and energy massing for war against the American
[44:04.760 --> 44:10.440]  people if you try to say no to having your pension funds taken but they tell
[44:10.440 --> 44:13.560]  you oh look at the outside threat look at the outside threat homeland
[44:13.560 --> 44:17.080]  securities here homeland securities here to keep you safe all the environmental
[44:17.080 --> 44:21.200]  movements here to keep you safe from them melting glaciers you go to Al
[44:21.200 --> 44:23.840]  Goren say the glaciers are getting bigger and he goes I won't respond to that
[44:23.840 --> 44:28.520]  absolute fact they're getting bigger absolute fact all this is going on they
[44:28.520 --> 44:34.240]  don't care this article by Kurt Nemo was key unthinkable propaganda for false
[44:34.240 --> 44:40.320]  flag nuclear terrorism and torture let's go ahead and play that clip
[44:43.400 --> 44:52.400]  I've placed three bombs in three American cities and all three are
[44:52.400 --> 44:55.240]  nuclear bombs
[44:55.240 --> 45:07.240]  I'm gonna miscalculate when your plan wasn't me
[45:09.000 --> 45:15.960]  he's the good guy what is this place nowhere doesn't exist neither do we he
[45:15.960 --> 45:21.080]  has to believe I have no limits suspect is being tortured this is unconstitutional
[45:21.080 --> 45:31.680]  I don't need your help I can take it back that up a few seconds to where
[45:31.680 --> 45:40.160]  she's sitting there talking about the Constitution see she's the bad guy and
[45:40.160 --> 45:46.280]  the hero Samuel L. Jackson is torturing this evil horrible looking guy who's
[45:46.280 --> 45:49.920]  sitting around laughing and then he says he wants to be tortured see all these
[45:49.920 --> 45:53.480]  are psychological pieces the person being tortured wants to be tortured he's
[45:53.480 --> 45:58.600]  gonna nuke kids he's bad I remember law enforcement magazines 15 years ago I was
[45:58.600 --> 46:03.440]  reading and every issue was anthrax is gonna be released and kill a million
[46:03.440 --> 46:08.160]  people do you torture the person or do you torture his children as a former
[46:08.160 --> 46:12.320]  black ops commander I tell you the answer is yes just bathing the cops in
[46:12.320 --> 46:18.840]  evil and in the cops torture you for no reason this is the warping of minds this
[46:18.840 --> 46:26.120]  is the twisting of minds that is going on and notice this is all coming out
[46:26.120 --> 46:29.680]  there's a whole bunch of TV shows and movies about torture and about nukes in
[46:29.680 --> 46:33.440]  the U.S. and how we've got to have a police state in the CIA on the streets
[46:33.440 --> 46:37.760]  of America this is all behavior placement brainwashing you are being
[46:37.760 --> 46:42.440]  brainwashed remember how they had a whole bunch of movies in the three months
[46:42.440 --> 46:46.880]  before 9-11 like Pearl Harbor and others about sneak attacks and about America
[46:46.880 --> 46:50.960]  standing up about everybody joining the military when it happens I mean they had
[46:50.960 --> 46:54.880]  it so pre-programmed that they went and told Hollywood to produce all those
[46:54.880 --> 47:00.280]  films to create this fake patriotic fervor ahead of the stage attacks of 9-11
[47:00.280 --> 47:05.080]  that's how scripted all this ish and I'm telling you they're gonna stage terror
[47:05.080 --> 47:08.880]  attacks and blame it on the American people they're gonna stage nuke attacks
[47:08.880 --> 47:13.240]  and blame it on foreign shadowy governments then they'll stage more
[47:13.240 --> 47:16.960]  attacks a few years later and always claim al-qaeda move to some new country
[47:16.960 --> 47:21.760]  it's the Empire's pretext to invade and take over let's finish the clip
[47:21.760 --> 47:49.760]  is being tortured this is unconstitutional how far would you go to
[47:49.760 --> 47:54.680]  protect your country unthinkable how many movies have you seen with a good
[47:54.680 --> 48:00.600]  guy's torture and then the cops come up in this latest video I've seen not only
[48:00.600 --> 48:08.400]  is the guy paralyzed he has no legs doesn't have legs from the upper hip
[48:08.400 --> 48:15.400]  down and they say get out of your chair and he says I can't and they said that
[48:15.400 --> 48:18.880]  is a police order you know they love this mental illness of the threat
[48:18.880 --> 48:23.000]  continuum of if you don't do what they say then that's paying compliance you
[48:23.000 --> 48:28.320]  are tortured in America torture we're a nation that tortures people openly
[48:28.320 --> 48:34.720]  everywhere and then says we don't torture all right I'm gonna go to break and
[48:34.720 --> 48:38.560]  come back and go to Michael who disagrees Bruce Randy Brenda Nathan and
[48:38.560 --> 48:43.400]  others we're gonna have open phones throughout the broadcast but let's be
[48:43.400 --> 48:50.560]  clear here every time I tuned into CNN or MSNBC for even five minutes I dropped
[48:50.560 --> 48:55.160]  by my parents house yesterday at about seven o'clock before I went home my mom
[48:55.160 --> 49:01.480]  was cooking dinner had MSNBC on and it was Chris Matthews as a guest on some
[49:01.480 --> 49:06.200]  other show and he was saying the entire Tea Party is racist and hates black
[49:06.200 --> 49:11.320]  people and it's all lies this doesn't raise premiums on your insurance and
[49:11.320 --> 49:17.640]  there are no death panels and just on and on and on and I watched about two
[49:17.640 --> 49:21.320]  minutes of it and everything they said was a lie and then they were saying we
[49:21.320 --> 49:28.720]  were liars though and then he went on to start attacking Rick Perry for saying
[49:28.720 --> 49:33.520]  Texas opted into the union and that was a lie and no state opted in and no state
[49:33.520 --> 49:37.640]  could opt out when it's all in the 9th to 10th amendment I mean that was a lie
[49:37.640 --> 49:47.120]  just everything they say is a liar distortion it's unbelievable and that's
[49:47.120 --> 49:54.360]  why nobody watches Chris Matthews show his show has like 400,000 viewers 400,000
[49:54.360 --> 49:58.600]  viewers I mean a small syndicated radio show has that many listeners these
[49:58.600 --> 50:02.800]  people are jokes but oh they're fancy suits and big teleprompters and big
[50:02.800 --> 50:10.600]  glistening sets and oh my gosh oh Chris Matthews says so but because people are
[50:10.600 --> 50:14.120]  getting lies to them they now have the Cybersecurity Act passed the house in
[50:14.120 --> 50:17.720]  the Senate and that's the headlines and all the newspapers Obama could shut
[50:17.720 --> 50:22.520]  down internet for any crisis including economic what do you think's gonna
[50:22.520 --> 50:26.720]  happen if they set a nuke off they're gonna start wars they're gonna take your
[50:26.720 --> 50:32.200]  pension funds they're gonna start arresting people I mean this is a
[50:32.200 --> 50:37.680]  hardcore takeover you understand that they're taking this nation by force and
[50:37.680 --> 50:42.640]  the Pentagon's run by these terrorists the banks are run by these terrorists the
[50:42.640 --> 50:45.960]  police departments are run by these terrorists does that mean the average
[50:45.960 --> 50:49.440]  person in the Pentagon or the government or the police department is a terrorist
[50:49.440 --> 50:53.520]  no but at the top it is a guild of criminals they're all reading off the
[50:53.520 --> 50:57.320]  same script they know exactly what they're doing and thousands of their
[50:57.320 --> 51:06.560]  scripts have fallen into our hands as the economy continues to decline

[56:13.320 --> 56:20.200]  first up go ahead hey Alex how you doing first I want to I want to say that I do
[56:20.200 --> 56:24.200]  support your show completely okay I just agree with you I just disagree with
[56:24.200 --> 56:28.440]  you on two little topics here when it comes to this we know that the globalists
[56:28.440 --> 56:32.520]  have their underground bunkers and things of this sort but I mean we know
[56:32.520 --> 56:36.000]  that they're also arrogant and they're cocky and all that other good stuff I
[56:36.000 --> 56:39.640]  don't think that they want I don't think that they're going to go the nuclear
[56:39.640 --> 56:42.440]  route because I don't think that they want to live in that bunker for a
[56:42.440 --> 56:47.200]  certain amount of time it's I think it goes against their their their makeup I
[56:47.200 --> 56:51.080]  think that they think they're bothered it on the pond living in it in an
[56:51.080 --> 56:56.320]  underground bunker so and I also did think that they they know that there's
[56:56.320 --> 57:01.760]  80 what is 80 100 million gun owners in this country and I don't think that they
[57:01.760 --> 57:05.440]  can I mean that we know that they cannot have you thought about the
[57:05.440 --> 57:09.880]  psychology they set a nuke off most people are going to go into primitive
[57:09.880 --> 57:13.960]  mode and do whatever the government says okay and they've got it all in place
[57:13.960 --> 57:18.920]  to openly take over society and the shadow government is now stepping out
[57:18.920 --> 57:24.680]  from behind the curtain showing itself they bombed Hiroshima and Nakasaki they
[57:24.680 --> 57:29.080]  just won't be upwind from it when it happens I think you miscalculate the
[57:29.080 --> 57:32.560]  type of people we're dealing with here I have seen them making all the
[57:32.560 --> 57:36.880]  preparations and putting the propaganda out for decades moving towards this
[57:36.880 --> 57:41.240]  point and I think we're in a real danger of the government the criminals that run
[57:41.240 --> 57:48.080]  it setting off a controlled nuke I think that's in the cards and they want a
[57:48.080 --> 57:52.760]  confrontation with groups of armed Americans they want this to degenerate
[57:52.760 --> 57:56.520]  this is their entertainment this is their fun this is what they do for
[57:56.520 --> 58:01.720]  enjoyment yeah but don't you agree that given the vast size of our country that
[58:01.720 --> 58:06.840]  it is impossible for them to completely lock down a martial law scenario given
[58:06.840 --> 58:11.920]  just the being no no no they'll just take over the communications and shut
[58:11.920 --> 58:17.040]  off freedom on the internet they've said this and then they'll mop up then
[58:17.040 --> 58:21.440]  they'll stage other terror attacks and claim domestic grips those evil people
[58:21.440 --> 58:25.280]  are supposedly working with al-qaeda wide al-qaeda they've been introducing that
[58:25.280 --> 58:27.600]  meme

[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:27.640]  Alex Jones okay for much of the last hour I was breaking down Obama the UN
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:32.320]  and others saying we need to go into Iran they're working with Al Qaeda they're
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:36.600]  gonna set a nuke off in the US that'll allow them to set up a domestic police
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:41.280]  state and launch new wars and take your pension funds we're gonna cover more
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:45.880]  detail cover this in more detail coming up but let's continue with your phone
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:51.120]  calls right now Bruce in Ohio thanks for holding oh Alex it's honor to talk to
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:57.080]  you yeah I share your concern I think that with Obama and Hillary saying that
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:02.760]  Al Qaeda might launch a nuke I bet you're gonna blame it on Iran and there's a
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:07.560]  prophecy in the book of Daniel I don't know if you've ever read it it's called
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:12.320]  it's conflict between the Ram and the ego the Ram has identified as media and
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:17.240]  Persia which is present-day Iraq and Iran and his ego part comes from the
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:22.440]  west at the time of the end and breaks both horns on the ramp we've broken down
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:28.000]  Iraq Persia which is Iran is the second horn and the Bible says after we break
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.120]  the second we're the part of the full western I believe is America the ego
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:37.560]  the ego gets broken and then that brings up the entire one-world system and the
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:41.720]  anti-crime goes into Jerusalem so I believe Bible promises being fulfilled
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:45.040]  yeah I think they're not blaming on Iran when it's gonna start this year too I
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:51.360]  think well they're already saying Iran is helping get nuclear material to Al
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:57.040]  Qaeda and on the record four years ago the White House put out a press release
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:00.840]  saying they were funding three different Al Qaeda groups and a fourth
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:06.840]  Kurdish group to attack the Iranians the Iranians are Shiites arch enemies of
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:13.400]  the Wahhabist Al Qaeda it is asinine and again we're not saying Ahmed Denizy is
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:19.880]  good the whole point is that just as Michael Savage has said even Limbaugh has
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:23.640]  said Obama will stage a crisis there's no way he's gonna get away with this
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:27.960]  politically without a crisis the problem is mainline Republicans are gonna get
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:33.080]  behind a war if even the threat of a new going off is put out there that's what
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:41.400]  happened in 2003 hey Alex can ask you a question sure there's an article in
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:46.200]  London Telegraph a minute yet is one worried about an earthquake in Tehran
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:50.920]  he's telling you see five million residents to flee the city you think he
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:56.920]  knows something about the harp station oh what's the headline five bit five
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:01.840]  million should flee Tehran over earth for years these five million Tehran
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:06.640]  residents should flee Iran's capital it sits on several fault lines is
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:12.160]  threatened by earthquakes president Mahmouda manager I said on Sunday he's
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:15.800]  telling five million people leave the city that's that's a lot of people well
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:19.800]  that's huge I like to pull that up I know he told Ban Ki-moon at the UN to
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.560]  investigate 9-11 is an inside job we've had a lot of other world leaders
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:29.800]  German Japanese you name it come out and say inside job but it's hardly ever in
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:35.400]  our media but because Ahmed Denizy is seen as an outsider and a terrorist our
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:39.600]  media does report this to make 9-11 truth sound bad excellent points Bruce
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:43.840]  appreciate your call we'll look into that headline Ahmed Denizy tells five
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:49.400]  million to flee Tehran Randy in Texas you're on the air thanks for taking my
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:55.080]  call Alex you woke me up about three years ago but as far as this situation
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:04:03.800]  with Iran I believe that there probably will be an actual attack on the United
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:10.040]  States that will be blamed on Iran and the White al-Qaeda at that point in
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:12.160]  time
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:16.800]  I was it was excuse me Ahmed Zina job that's a hard name to say for me
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:23.240]  sometimes has already stated that he will attack American troops in Iraq if
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:31.920]  that happens yes and if that happens we're gonna see the Strait of Hormuz
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:35.760]  filled with burning ships stay there I want you to be able to finish your point

[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:28.080]  hour we're just one segment we're gonna open phones throughout the broadcast I'm
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:32.000]  gonna get into leaked us documents called for global regime to tackle climate
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:39.160]  change also the UN is now having to admit that they basically stage the H1N1
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:44.320]  pandemic they've been caught with their pants down this is a huge victory we had
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:49.120]  a caller then I'm going back to Randy Brendan Nathan Tim David and others who
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:53.600]  called in with what sounded like a bizarre statement five million should flee
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:57.800]  Tehran over earthquake fears Ahmed Denizide that's the one in Telegraph
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:03.600]  headline and this came out yesterday at least five million Tehran residents
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:07.180]  should flee Iran's capital because it sits on several fault lines and is
[01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:12.240]  threatened by earthquakes president Mahmoud Ahmed Denizide said we cannot
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:17.280]  order people to evacuate the city but provisions have been made at least five
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:21.000]  million should leave Tehran so it is less crowded and more manageable in case
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.880]  of an incident the mere news agency quoted him as saying 1997 Secretary
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:31.520]  defense Cohen said they have earthquake weapons told the Army Times that you're
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:35.000]  having all these strange earthquakes that are hitting population centers there
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.160]  is a massive uptick in earthquakes but that can naturally happen in cycles what
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:43.680]  suspicious is it keeps hitting very dense areas you're having record
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:47.120]  earthquakes in the last hundred years of recorded events and they're hitting
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:52.240]  major cities so what does he know something we don't know Mr. Ahmed
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:56.320]  Denizide said the government could offer land loans and 4% interest and
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:59.920]  substantial subsidies in the provinces to encourage Tehran residents to leave the
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:03.880]  sprawling capital does he know the West is going to nuke Tehran and that's the
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:07.840]  earthquake he's talking about a man-made equivalent of a massive you know
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:16.160]  10.0 I mean why is he saying get out of the city that guy I don't know what to
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:19.360]  say it sounds wacky but then you know the science it could be something behind
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:23.440]  it Tehran province has nearly 14 million inhabitants 8 million of whom live in
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:27.080]  the city which straddles several fault lines experts have warned that a strong
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:30.840]  earthquake in Tehran could kill hundreds of thousands of people Mr. Ahmed
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:36.000]  Denizide said that 67% of the Iran 74 million strong population lives in urban
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.360]  areas we cannot predict when earthquake will happen but if anything happens to
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:46.440]  Tehran province 13.8 million residents how can we manage that he asked Iran is
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:50.720]  prone to earthquakes shouts by the Himalayas many of which have been
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:54.600]  devastating the worst in recent times at the southern city of bomb in December
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:58.480]  03 killing 31,000 people about a quarter of the population destroying its
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:05.440]  ancient mud-built citadel I tell you we're living in crazy times I mean this
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:09.120]  does sound like into the world type stuff you've got it sounds like something
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:14.120]  out of a Greek tragedy leave Argos the Kraken is coming release the Kraken we
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:20.160]  must leave Argos I mean it it's just getting weirder by the moment Obama's
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:24.440]  running around saying the number one threat to the US is al-Qaeda nukes that
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:27.520]  they've probably got nukes alright I'm gonna shut up and take your calls it's
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:32.600]  just the twist and turns when we take calls so they bring up all these
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:36.520]  incredible issues Randy for some stations may have just joined us recap your
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:41.640]  point because we see this narrative they paint for five years wide al-Qaeda you
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:44.960]  know the average American they call it wide al-Qaeda you know they're working
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:47.680]  with them they're everywhere and they bust a few schizophrenics that think
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:50.900]  they work with al-Qaeda to create this illusion and now they're telling the
[01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:56.680]  police anybody with an info wars dot com sticker maybe with them and and they're
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:59.320]  they're saying I'm calling for violence everywhere when I'm calling for the
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:03.400]  opposite I'm calling for calm and awareness and info war to awaken people
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:07.540]  and now they're saying nukes are gonna go off and it's perfect timing they're
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:11.000]  trying to blame it on Iran I mean this is crazy Randy go ahead and make your
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:18.880]  point yes like I said whenever whenever we have this false flag nuclear attack
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:24.200]  here the first thing is going to happen is that all the politicians approval
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:31.280]  ratings are going to go up just like after 9-11 they'll be able to do almost
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:37.280]  anything they want to at that point in time with popular support the sheeple
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:42.240]  will fall in line and think about that they get to go into Iran they get to
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.520]  start wars with Russia they get to take the pension funds they get to set up a
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:52.280]  bigger domestic police state terror helps the criminal government and then in
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:57.480]  every case within 15 minutes of the Christmas Day underwear bombing they're
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:02.320]  on the news with pre-packaged specials about the naked body scanners saying
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:06.120]  they just decided to put them in that day because of it when they ordered the
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:11.720]  stinking things a year before in 2008 when the head of Homeland Security
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:15.640]  ordered them then he went to work for the company and got paid hundreds of
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:20.880]  thousands of dollars or even more I was reading it's almost a million and again
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:25.640]  it's all scripted you can see it's all scripted within 15 minutes of the
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:28.800]  bombing they're saying don't worry we've got naked body scanners and then it
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:32.160]  turns out the State Department was ordered to give them a visa and help
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:35.400]  him get on the plane and then we had eyewitnesses who were later confirmed
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:39.160]  to be accurate that said they saw them the government get him on the plane I
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:43.640]  mean how much more obvious does this have to get well it couldn't really get
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:49.760]  much more obvious than that but the thing is is that when Iran after we
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:53.720]  attacked them when they attack our soldiers that means that we're going to
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:14:00.200]  be facing some pretty heavy losses in Iraq because it you know it's not that
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:04.800]  far they could fire missiles over there fairly easily the Iranians are unified
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:11.200]  they had a world war one style army in the seven-year Iran-Iraq war they now
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:17.120]  have a close to first world military with tens of thousands of deployed and
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:23.240]  hidden very accurate medium-range missiles and they lost over a million
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:27.280]  and a half people against Saddam with the US and Rumsfeld running the whole
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:31.400]  operation it is going to be hell on earth and they are going to use strategic
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:35.920]  nukes on those advancing Iranian armies and you're gonna have all these good
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:38.560]  old boys that don't care that their pension funds being taken or they're
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:41.480]  losing their job they're gonna be drinking jack daniels and eating
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:46.480]  Kentucky fried chicken in front of their TVs cheering as nukes go off it is
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:51.160]  going to be you can see them setting the whole thing up I know when it's
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:55.440]  pathetic but at least people are starting to wake up now I've been
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:15:02.200]  passing out copies of in game and the Obama deception and I've got a hundred
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:09.560]  blank DVDs waiting for yours and Jason's new movies I bless you Randy I
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:15.040]  appreciate your call folks I'm not up here on the radio saying this for
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:19.480]  entertainment I'm risking my life doing this you understand this is not a game
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:25.720]  this is not a drill this is not a joke it's all scripted you know earlier I
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:30.720]  said we've had thousands of their documents fallen to our own hands every
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:35.280]  week we get a declassified or leaked CIA document that's confirmed to be accurate
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:39.960]  where they talk about our apathy and how pathetic we are and how they're setting
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:45.840]  up a police state every week we get a new UN or US document other setting up
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:53.320]  world government I mean is but the average childlike brain out there
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:56.640]  adults that are like five-year-old children a five-year-old believes they
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:01.120]  can make believe they can just say oh no that's not the case and live in denial
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:06.880]  adults cannot live in denial and I'm talking to the police and the military
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:09.800]  and all of you out there that work for the system who were not bad I know most
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:13.680]  of you aren't bad most of you've actually seen more than general public so
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:19.640]  you're not naive and look I'm not risking my life for nothing here I know we
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:22.520]  can beat these people if we've got courage and speak out against them but
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:26.200]  if you won't start speaking out and get involved and if you won't make a stand
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:33.680]  now and point out the obvious we are dead meat do you understand these bankers
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:39.040]  funded Hitler Stalin and Mao they loved a violently reengineered society we are
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:44.240]  all in grave danger Brenda in Oklahoma you're on the air yes I'm just gonna
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:49.240]  reiterate you know I've seen the deal on the news yet well it's on internet news
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:54.760]  about Obama saying you know we could be stuck with nuclear weapons and I thought
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:17:01.680]  oh no we're in for a false flag I was just wanting to you'd already said nothing
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:08.320]  big well anything else you want to add Brenda oh you know a few years ago I
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:14.080]  went to Ohio on a plane and I had taken some different material with me and
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:19.800]  left them in strategic places along the way and restrooms and stuff and I'm
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:25.600]  bringing to a gentleman and he was a psychiatrist psychologist for men coming
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:30.640]  back from the war trying to talk to them you know I guess it would work to
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:36.520]  commit suicide or something and I said oh I said did you think that 9-11 was
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:40.200]  an inside job and he just says me says American government is involved in
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:44.080]  many covert operations and I said would you like a take that he said no he
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:47.400]  wouldn't talk to me about that there's just a little extra so you were in the
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:53.400]  airport like Hansel and Gretel leaving little DVD films for people yeah I'd
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:56.880]  leave them in like in the bathroom and then on the airplane I put them in those
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:02.560]  little magazines that they have and I handed one to a gentleman that was in
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:07.000]  the Army and you know he's going back home to help his mama move in New York
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:13.360]  and he gladly took some information and I found that strangers are more
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:18.720]  accepting of information than friends and relatives are so but I did leave quite
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:21.920]  a bit of stuff everywhere I know the maid and in the restroom she said oh
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:26.080]  somebody must left this I said I said maybe I'll be back you know she just
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:33.520]  left it there so I was hoping it picked up by somebody well God bless you you're
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:39.280]  awesome and I just love your spirit and keep it up Brenda God bless you look
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:44.760]  we've talked about false flag nuke attacks for a long time because the
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:49.800]  government's always been hyping it and let us hope that this is like Dick
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:55.240]  Cheney and Governor Ridge when they were issuing fake nuke attack alerts I mean
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:19:01.960]  we know Alcada doesn't exist we know that it's a creation of the CIA we know
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:09.400]  that the sky is the limit for these people and we know the old the Latin
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:16.920]  phrase kimono or who benefits we know who benefits from this and they have a
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:21.880]  trained every police department in the country for IED attacks for no reason
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:26.240]  they go in and they brainwash the cops that the citizens are gonna attack them
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:30.600]  and kill them as a way to federalize them and as a way to scare them into
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:37.840]  going along with the brainwashing and America has turned into a government that
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:43.720]  is an armed camp against the people and now the banks have stolen so much money
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:50.680]  that they're raising all the taxes but cutting essential services and finally
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:54.120]  all over the nation police are telling the truth and telling citizens buy a
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:20:00.400]  gun we can't protect you we'll be back with Nathan Tim David Leo and others

[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:02.720]  way out of this there's got to be some way to stop it the only way I know is
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:06.200]  just to continue to discredit these people and teach people their tricks and
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:10.200]  how they operate and what their game plan is Nathan in Texas then Tim and
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:15.320]  Brazil and others go ahead Nathan yeah good to talk to you again I just wanted
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:19.200]  to say you know I want to bring up a point what if this is not the end of the
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:23.040]  world you know it seems like a lot of people are just kind of waiting around
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:26.720]  for God or somebody to come back and save them and I think it's gonna be the
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:30.320]  Russians who end up saving us from the world I mean that that could explain
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:34.400]  easily why we're so openly evil why we torture why we terrorize you know why
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:38.700]  we invade countries why the rest of the world knows they weren't starting
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:42.600]  illegal wars and everything and Russia is just sitting over there you know not
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:46.160]  really saying so much just kind of out of the picture a little bit and they're
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:52.000]  obviously not scared of us so I've said this I've said this many times that in
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.640]  the globalist plan they're gonna bankrupt America use our military to build
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:26:00.360]  their world government and simultaneously and here's a microcosm
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:05.000]  Rupert Murdoch in his foreign newspapers demonizes the US covers the
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:09.800]  torture covers how we're illegal then domestically he poses as a pro-war guy
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:15.600]  who's supposedly a patriot okay and exactly we are being set up to be hated
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:20.280]  and defiled and scapegoated for the total world financial implosion that's
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:24.720]  been going into full swing the last three years and you're absolutely right
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:29.760]  and and I don't trust any government as history shows they're filled with
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:34.560]  wickedness and corruption and Russia is as crooked as a barrel of snakes but
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:39.880]  really studying it Russia was fully controlled by the globalist since 1917
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:44.680]  and it's been declassified that our government put the Soviets in power but
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:49.280]  the communists in power engineered all the fake wars it was all staged until
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:53.560]  Yeltsin left office and Putin got in and Putin still works with them and at some
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:58.720]  levels they're connected but it's it's in Russia they pay you to have children
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:03.600]  here they're demonizing having children in Russia they talk about the new world
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:08.200]  order and world government and they've arrested scores of top bankers and and
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:15.360]  kicked them out of the country so it does appear that there is a fisher we
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:19.400]  know China is deep in bed with the new world order but simultaneously these
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:23.920]  guys are all cutthroat so they're all simultaneously trying to encircle each
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:29.320]  other I mean it's a nightmare yeah and you're right you know it is time to
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:32.280]  make a stand and that's why I decided tonight at about six o'clock I'm gonna
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:35.760]  go down to Dallas I'm gonna be standing on the Kennedy grass you know and I
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:39.120]  decided that anybody who wants for there to be United States tomorrow is
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:42.600]  welcome to come down there and join me but if not I'll just be standing out
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:46.240]  there by myself with the sign so everybody who comes down there every
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:50.280]  day to take pictures can you know get to hear the message and so that's a
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:55.880]  corner of that's in the corner of Elm and what I think it's commerce that it
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:59.160]  meets up with it's over there in the West End I'm not so familiar with the area
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:02.520]  but I know how to get there I know it's right where that's a great idea
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:07.560]  everybody that loves freedom and this isn't gonna save the world but it's one
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:12.200]  more step towards that anybody who's angry and wants to expose the new world
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:16.240]  order and expose false flag terror and expose the murder of Kennedy show up at
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:20.760]  what five six o'clock tonight at the grass you know yes I'll be there all
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:25.160]  right buddy I'm sure some folks will show up and it's just that active resistance
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:29.840]  that active stepping up standing up that'll turn the criminal tide let's
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:34.280]  talk to Tim and Brazil Tim you're on the air Alex Jones are you doing today
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:40.640]  all right all right I'm gonna try to stay on this a nuclear warning subject
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:46.040]  without getting off of it so I'll make my point quick I think in my mind it's
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:49.960]  almost unlikely for al-Qaeda to possess nukes I think they would most likely
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:53.560]  get a hold of dirty bombs before they could get a hold of those but if they
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:29:00.520]  do I think it's most likely we put it in their hands somehow some way I got a
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:04.000]  third point that I wanted to make last Monday I think I was listening to the
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.720]  show down here and I heard somebody make a point a statement towards you that
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:13.240]  you're just as big of a movement leader as Martin Luther King or any of the guys
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:17.720]  back during the 50s and the 60s and you said oh I don't I don't think I'm that
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:24.640]  big of a of an influence on people yet I just want you to know man that people
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:28.160]  like us look at you and and there's a bunch of names that come to my head when
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:34.800]  I think of guys like you think of Paul Revere John Hancock John Pufford these
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:39.640]  were guys that stood up against the irony and they reported on it and they
[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:42.760]  made everybody want to finish your point finish your point we come back and
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:47.280]  then I'm gonna get into a whole bunch of news and recap and go into more detail
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:55.360]  with the false flag nuke card we're on the march the empires on the run Alex

[01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:22.520]  doing is my duty I'm a free person who studied history who has discovered how
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:27.040]  corrupt the leaders of the planet are how corrupt the top corporations are
[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:32.160]  I've read their white papers their documents what they say they believe in
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:37.440]  and it's nightmarish total slavery population reduction poisoning the
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:43.000]  population starting wars staging terror they brag about it it's an army
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.680]  training manuals for black ops commanders captain and above how to
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:54.180]  stage terror I mean that exists operation Northwoods exists I have to
[01:33:54.180 --> 01:34:00.000]  talk about that even if it was unpopular eight years ago before 9-11 in
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:05.720]  the day of 9-11 I've got to tell the truth and so the caller Tim in Brazil
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:11.520]  you know I mean was talking about how wonderful I am and I appreciate that Tim
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:18.160]  but the issue here is all of you out there who love freedom and love the
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:27.520]  truth and who are good I admire you and so I never want to turn this into a
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:32.120]  cult of personality situation when I get up here and I say I've been right
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:35.520]  about this and that and and and I chronicle all the things that we've
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:40.240]  broken down that are accurate it's so people pay attention to us and
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:43.960]  understand this isn't a joke we know what we're talking about but it's not
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:49.280]  that hard to know what you're talking about history is there how many
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:52.520]  globalist and government documents and corporate documents have fallen into our
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:57.600]  hands a new one has fallen into our hands and the feds are announcing they
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:00.520]  want to take the pension funds and now people are saying my gosh it's in the
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:04.800]  news they're going to take the pension funds or they just took my pension fund
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:11.200]  I exactly I mean it's I don't deserve credit for this like oh my gosh thank
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:14.240]  you so much Alex you warned us they're gonna take our pension funds well what
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:18.760]  person wouldn't warn you see that's the thing if people build me up is some
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:23.560]  superhuman wonderful George Washington type character they then don't see
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:29.720]  themselves as the leaders they need to be I'm doing the minimum which is my
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:35.760]  maximum when you're faced with a threat of this magnitude the only thing you can
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:42.440]  do is fight it with every bone in your body with every fiber of muscle with
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:48.800]  every brain cell you've got that's all you can do and it doesn't mean any of us
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:53.480]  are going to be perfect it just means we got our heart in the right place and
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:57.560]  we're warning people and we're standing up person to person we're taking action
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:02.280]  and that spirit that idea is unstoppable I want him to be able to finish up but
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:08.200]  coming up well let him finish and then I'm gonna get into this because there's
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:11.840]  a bunch of other incredibly important news I want to recap and then expand on
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:16.760]  the nuke information as the government prepares for a possible false flag nuke
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:21.880]  attack but just just the fear mongering itself we know is propaganda and a
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:25.840]  psychological terrorism so I'm gonna go over that after I cover a bunch of other
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:30.480]  news we haven't gotten to yet that is so vital this is all so incredibly
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:35.880]  important Tim finish your point in Brazil I just I just wanted to let you
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:39.040]  know Alex that I've been listening to you for 14 years ever since I was in
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:44.400]  middle school you inspired me to stand up and talk out to I'm a professional
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:47.320]  wrestler I travel around the world I go to the United States for tours all the
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:52.120]  time I hand out your DVDs when I go to my shows I bought your new ones I'm
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:58.000]  having my my web page moderator translate them into Brazilian Portuguese
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:03.200]  so I can hand them out to people down here so I just want a great job what's
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:08.600]  your stage name Tim today's Tim Anderson all right we'll have to check it out God
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:13.320]  bless you and I appreciate your call and again I'm not chastising people who call
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:20.640]  in and try to compare me to Martin Luther King or something it isn't about
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:25.240]  Alex Jones that's all I'm saying if you like what I've done if it if it has
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:32.040]  inspired you that's what I want and I want to see you take action and stand up
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:35.760]  for the Republic stand up the Bill of Rights the Constitution because if we
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:40.360]  don't have that we have nothing and everything this government is doing is
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:47.720]  180 degrees against the Bill of Rights and Constitution it's that simple now
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:56.080]  I'm gonna get back into Obama says nuclear terrorism is the single biggest
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:38:01.960]  threat to the US and analyze that and I'm also gonna get to the Russian
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:06.560]  president Medidyev says Israeli strike on Iran could spark global catastrophe
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:10.960]  which it could and that's what all this hype about nuclear terrorism is meant to
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:16.400]  do on one level it's multifaceted and how there's all these movies and TV shows
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:20.800]  now promoting suitcase nukes in America and how torture in police state is
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:26.160]  needed to counter it like Samuel L. Jackson's new unthinkable then we're
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:34.600]  gonna get into another story and this has got to be the it's more than 20 of
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:44.920]  these the last year leaked or declassified British UN Danish White
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:50.800]  House the latest is White House secret battle plans against the American
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:57.720]  people and it's economic battle plans most warfare is psychological or

[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:46.760]  woodrug and they discovered three months ago and found in committee that the
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:51.960]  heads of the World Health Organization and the EU and in the US in England were
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:56.600]  paid off by Big Pharma to come out and lie about H1N1 they knew it wasn't even
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:00.960]  dangerous they hyped up people who had kidney failure who are already about to
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:05.280]  die who supposedly had it it was a dangerous vaccine here it is global
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:09.760]  health chiefs have finally admitted that they may have overreacted a swine flu

[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:57.000]  much more dangerous than nukes genetic engineering gone awry it's already gone

[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:25.800]  years we have been that's really why I started reporting on it reporting that
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:30.240]  police and foundation groups and government funded groups infiltrate any
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:35.200]  peaceful protest pro-second amendment pro-property rights anti-war it left
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:39.120]  right it doesn't matter and we have caught them and many others have caught
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:44.280]  them in Greece and in England and in Canada and in the US you know major
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:51.960]  newspapers over and over again have been forced to report the truth that the
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:55.960]  police and other government-controlled groups are staging violence at
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:48:03.920]  demonstrations now two weeks ago we began to report that we broke this by the
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:07.720]  way I'm proud of this that shows the power now that info wars.com and
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:12.320]  prisonplanet.com have because you the listeners took those articles what was
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:17.160]  it two weeks ago or more those first articles I said red alert they're gonna
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:22.840]  infiltrate the tea parties and stage violence and hold up racist signs to
[01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:29.480]  pose as tea partiers and they're being foundation and government funded and
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:35.000]  we've now identified several groups and they're all working for government now
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:39.800]  there's a new article about this where we identify people by name at prisonplanet.com
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:44.000]  today but I hadn't seen this article and I was digging through my stack while
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:53.080]  Marty was talking and I saw this story out of the AP this is a big big big big
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:49:02.880]  victory foes of tea party movement to infiltrate rallies that's right it is
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:10.200]  now in the Associated Press now remember two weeks ago Paul Watson wrote
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:14.000]  articles about this I begged you the listeners I said this is a maximum alert
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:19.560]  we identified the anarchist groups we linked to them we showed what they were
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:24.440]  doing and then other blogs and websites picked up on the last two weeks until a
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:30.280]  crescendo and the AP was forced to report on it opponents of fiscally
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:34.360]  conservative tea party movement say they plan to infiltrate and dismantle the
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:38.680]  political group by trying to make its members appear as racist homophobic and
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:46.200]  moronic now again we broke all of this I'm just giving Paul Watson Kurt Nemo
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:51.400]  Steve Watson the credit they've been writing articles every day every week
[01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:56.600]  day on this for two weeks or more than two weeks and you the listeners get to
[01:49:56.600 --> 01:50:04.720]  credit as well Jason Levin creator of crash the tea party org said the group
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:08.200]  has 65 leaders in major cities across the country are trying to recruit members
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:14.040]  infiltrate tea party events on April 15 tax filing day that's only one group we
[01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:16.440]  identified some of the largest anarchist groups they're not anarchists
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:19.560]  they're all literally these big government-funded groups have been there
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:25.920]  they'll be handing out communist workers newspapers they'll be handing out I
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:30.440]  said I'm going to your calls I just I say I'm gonna cover something and I try
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:34.400]  to mention it and then I start covering it it's just these people are such scum
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:41.880]  but this is a big victory because what do you think Carlos Watson's doing what
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:46.280]  do you think scambles slime ball Chris Matthews is doing what do you think
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:50.560]  Obama's handlers are doing when they say oh you oppose anything we're doing
[01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:55.120]  you're a racist they are the ones invoking it the black congressional
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:59.160]  caucus stage that event no one called them the n-word or sped on them and we've

[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:32.760]  like I'm printing some of the older articles to integrate them together
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:37.040]  where the Democrats have been caught attacking their own offices all of it
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:41.400]  because this is big news now hitting the AP that they're out there posing and
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:46.040]  putting out racist messages to discredit the tea party another form of false
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:52.160]  flags see how everything is false flag literally I mean it's got to be 70 80
[01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:56.120]  percent of the time any issue we look at it's false flag false flag I've noticed
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:55:01.240]  people do this individually in business now or our supposed competitors in
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:05.760]  alternative media I'm not their competitor they just think I am are
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:10.360]  constantly making stuff up or staging things about us I mean it's just it's
[01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:17.960]  in the culture to lie and set up the people you want to discredit it's the
[01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:21.120]  same thing with the nuclear terror threat it's the same thing with the
[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:26.920]  environmental threat from carbon dioxide it's just all a false flag to blame you
[01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:30.760]  to blame you for your car your business your house your job at a factory it's
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:36.720]  all about making you bad so they can go after you in fact I want to get Paul
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:42.960]  Watson on in the last 30 minutes of the show if he can do it or Curt Nemo I
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:46.920]  mean I'm going to get Watson to pull out the first article we wrote about this I
[01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:51.520]  know it was more than two weeks ago identifying the anarchist groups and even
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:56.080]  when we link to the anarchist groups own sites calling for stirring up violence
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:56:02.240]  and racism and posing as tea party people other news outlets picked up our
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:07.120]  articles and said Jones claims I claim it's like I claim I got the my act
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:10.720]  report of the Homeland Security report I claimed I got the clergy response team
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:16.360]  reports I claimed I got Operation Northwoods for a year I was covering
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:20.920]  Operation Northwoods from ABC News in the National Security Archives and there
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:24.440]  were news articles saying I've made up Operation Northwoods we don't make
[01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:31.040]  anything up here okay nothing we tell the truth now does that not mean that we
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:34.960]  don't make mistakes yeah we make mistakes every once in a while I wish I was
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:40.440]  wrong about this I wish I was wrong believe me I wouldn't be working this
[01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:46.240]  hard I mean I can't even make myself take off folks I can't quit thinking about
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:51.880]  this I can't quit desiring to warn people it has overtaken me it's all I do
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:56.680]  it's all I think about it's all I dream about when I'm asleep because I
[01:56:56.680 --> 01:57:00.640]  understand how dire the straights are and how serious the costs are and I've
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:04.240]  seen the success we've had when we get up off our hind ends and give these
[01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:09.520]  people a fight in the info war all right I'm gonna come back and go to David
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:14.760]  Leo D Fred Ken and others I'm gonna just go to call after call and then I'm gonna
[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:18.880]  start one of the news I'm gonna recap the nuke threat as your calls are on that
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:26.000]  subject and then the setup of the Tea Party segwaying in to the foundation
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:30.880]  funded and government funded groups staging violence and demonizing the
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:36.040]  Tea Parties and integrated in with CNN and MSNBC and this image they're
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:39.640]  creating because they're not just falsely claiming the Tea Parties are
[01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:44.120]  racist they're falsely claiming that people who don't like to fell to reserve
[01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:52.360]  or the looting are terrorists it's all fake it's all fake occasionally they
[01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:55.760]  find some real schizophrenic they can set up who was actually planning
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:58:01.080]  something but that's very rare 90 plus percent of it when you talk about the
[01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:04.920]  setup of the Tea Parties is fake in fact I really haven't found anywhere where
[01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:08.320]  it wasn't fake I'm just leaving some room there and saying there could be
[01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:15.600]  something that's real I mean it is a manufactured fraud I'm not gonna belabor
[01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:19.200]  this issue but if you want to support us and see future films and if you want to

[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:30.120]  extent we understand their game plan we understand their operation we have the
[02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:34.520]  enemy's operation manual we know their program and with that knowledge if we
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:38.800]  take action and have the initiative we can defeat them knowing the enemy is
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:44.480]  half the battle let's go to your calls David in California you're on the air
[02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:50.000]  AJ how you doing man I'm alright because we're having a lot of victories yeah
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:54.480]  yeah one thing I gotta say is that David Rockefeller said all you need is one
[02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:58.720]  more world crisis to bring in the new world order and listening to Obama say
[02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:02.920]  this stuff makes makes you think a real lot that's an incredible point in fact
[02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:07.280]  guys Google David Rockefeller about all we need is a crisis for global
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:12.080]  transformation to bring in the new world order and then that and then the Kissinger
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:16.280]  club about UN troops just Kissinger UN troops and then the David Rockefeller
[02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:19.880]  quote about we're on the verge of a global transformation all we need is the
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:24.800]  right crisis go ahead right right and it doesn't even have to be a nuke just in
[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:28.400]  United States they could just do a couple all over the world now I also want
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:33.200]  to bring it was point about the Samuel Jack movie you're talking about this
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:37.520]  also reminds me of that ex files that they did like nine months before at 911
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:40.800]  seems like they're just trying to like trap us for something like this already
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:45.360]  trying to put it through the media and get it into our brain so once it happens
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:50.440]  then people another fabulous point the lone gunman and I had the star of the
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:54.640]  lone gunman call me and come to Austin to meet with me he said the CIA Dean
[02:02:54.640 --> 02:03:00.280]  Haglin was planting those those scripts on them and and Chris Carter this is
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:05.760]  from the host and what was it six or seven months before 911 the government
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:10.780]  hijacks a jet to fly at the World Trade Center a passenger jet as a pretext
[02:03:10.780 --> 02:03:16.680]  to invade Afghanistan and uses a drill at simultaneously to make norad stand
[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:22.840]  down that exact thing happened on 911 right right right because it seems like
[02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:27.440]  it's just repeating itself and not only you are like doing the red alarm right
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:31.640]  now I listen to Steve quail a little bit here and there and you know he says the
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:36.360]  same thing me and myself just being woken up for two years and going way
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:39.240]  deep into everything watching all your documentaries really boost listen to
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:43.280]  you every day I feel the same thing brother it just feels like that these
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:47.040]  people really gonna have to move something because we're getting so much
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:51.600]  stronger right now we can people that they're really gonna have to make some
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:55.640]  moves right now and I can really see them doing exactly their agenda is in
[02:03:55.640 --> 02:04:00.080]  place but it's cracking at the foundations they're in trouble and we
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:04.120]  know how they operate and everybody not just intellectually can see the
[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:08.200]  evidence but you can feel it anybody who's got their head screwed on straight
[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:15.360]  as any discernment can feel the evil rising right right right so that's
[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:20.480]  pretty much all I have to say AJ thanks for everything I'm burning DVDs and let's

[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:34.680]  control myself down because I have got one two three four five six seven eight
[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:40.200]  nine stacks of news that I have to at least skim the surface of but four or
[02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:43.360]  five of these stacks I have to go into the tail and we got two guests coming up
[02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:48.360]  next hour so I'm going to move as quickly as I can right now through some
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:52.320]  calls to the bottom of the hour then I'm news blitzing for the next half hour
[02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:57.360]  before Webster Tarpoli and then Paul Watson join us but right now let's go
[02:11:57.360 --> 02:12:03.000]  to Leo in Missouri or is it Montana go ahead you're on the air yeah that's
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:08.040]  Missouri thanks for taking my call I wanted to say I believe the false flag
[02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:12.680]  attack is actually speaking of a false flag attack because it takes the focus
[02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:16.880]  off of what's really hurting this country and that's the economy and his
[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:20.840]  health care bill which is really going to tax us possibly the death for some
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:25.640]  people and I really believe that's the actual false flag attack not so much an
[02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:29.520]  actual no absolutely absolutely and that's what I'm gonna cover coming up
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:32.200]  when I recap this and get into more detail and some facets I haven't gotten
[02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:36.280]  into is that Governor Ridge is on record that when he was the head of
[02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:40.560]  Homeland Security they would issue fake terror alerts for political gain that is
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:45.120]  an act of terrorism if you call a bomb threat in and you haven't really sent a
[02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:49.200]  bomb to the courthouse you still get a felony charge because it created the
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:53.640]  fear and endangered people it's like yelling fire in a theater or worse and
[02:12:53.640 --> 02:12:58.760]  we know they've done this in the past we know al-qaeda is manufactured we know
[02:12:58.760 --> 02:13:02.480]  they're not really gonna nuke us and I agree bare minimum this is a psychological
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:07.120]  terror attack right and I'm to the point where I'm not scared of this stuff
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:10.600]  anymore if anything it makes me more angry because I'm one of those people if
[02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:14.680]  you hit me I'm gonna hit you back twice as hard and that's the way I think we
[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:18.000]  got a look at stuff like this when they come out with stuff like this we just
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:21.000]  gotta say okay if you're gonna do it then go ahead and do it otherwise keep
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:25.320]  your mouth shut and just let us live and it's important to stand up and say we
[02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:28.720]  know you're behind it we know you're engaged in psychological and physical
[02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:34.560]  terrorism and to hound Obama Al Gore Newt Gennrich and that's happening
[02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:39.280]  everywhere these globalists go they are being hounded and exposed by real
[02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:42.680]  Americans and the same things happening all over the world by patriots that
[02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:46.840]  understand the cost we need to let them know that we know and that's freaking
[02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:51.280]  them out because if we expose false flag terror and how it's used at every level
[02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:55.720]  now AP confirming that the Democratic operatives are infiltrating and posing
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:14:00.080]  as racist again I told you that years ago not because I'm smart I study these
[02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:04.560]  people I mean it's real simple I mean it's like if I'm fishing and a purple
[02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:09.520]  worm with a green tail I'm catching bass every time I cast it but I put a red
[02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:14.440]  worm on with a gold tail and I don't catch any fish I know it's a purple worm
[02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:19.480]  I'm not that smart folks but I can see how things work by watching and that's
[02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:22.960]  all I've done is watch these people and read their own documents over and over
[02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:28.320]  and over and over again I'll be on the air in a month saying as AP even admitted
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:35.000]  the Democrats are staging the racist signs and things at these tea parties
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:40.240]  and there'll be websites saying Alex is a liar because I won't have the AP that
[02:14:40.240 --> 02:14:46.000]  day in my hand I happen to have it today because it just came out that's the
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:50.640]  problem I've got too much evidence Leo I mean here's the headline foes of tea
[02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:55.480]  party movement to infiltrate Rowley's and poses racist I'm sorry go ahead that's
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:58.920]  you're exactly right and if people keep their eyes open they'll even see it on
[02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:02.560]  their local level the bullying that's being done by their government and it's
[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:07.000]  just like facing a bully you got to face them down until he either leaves you
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:11.140]  alone or you get him down and you beat him until he leaves you alone and that's
[02:15:11.140 --> 02:15:14.720]  where I think we're at now people need to stop being scared of all this stuff
[02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:20.320]  and actually face them down and say hey we're not putting up with your garbage
[02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:23.200]  anymore so either do what you're gonna do or we're gonna do what we're gonna do
[02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:29.760]  and I agree go ahead my call now thank you so much absolutely I mean that's
[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:33.280]  why they're on the news saying the tea partiers are terrorists the tea parties
[02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:36.560]  flew a plane into a building the tea partiers shot up the building the tea
[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:40.320]  partiers are going to attack we've got to have naked body scanners or the
[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:43.760]  terrorists will get us and it turns out it was staged I mean it's admitted that
[02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:47.760]  that guy was a government minion and that they got him on the airplane case
[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:53.480]  closed it's all staged I mean do people think I got up here a year ago and then
[02:15:53.480 --> 02:15:56.920]  again two weeks ago hot and heavy every day saying the Democrats are going to
[02:15:56.920 --> 02:16:01.120]  infiltrate the tea parties and stage violence and poses racist I mean I mean
[02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:05.440]  do you think I was just saying that folks we we were on their websites we were
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:11.800]  reading what they were saying we know what they're doing false flag terror
[02:16:11.800 --> 02:16:16.640]  it's terrorizing the tea parties who want to end the Federal Reserve cut taxes
[02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:20.360]  and get our country back and protect our second amendment our borders and a
[02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:24.000]  bunch of good people the fact they've pulled them 40% are independence or
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:28.000]  Democrats most of them are people who never got politically involved and have
[02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:34.240]  lost their job and are angry and the media says no you're a racist terrorist I
[02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:39.640]  mean folks that exposes 9-11 right there look how they call you a terrorist for
[02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:43.480]  being a tea party person or a racist it's the same thing look how they're
[02:16:43.480 --> 02:16:47.160]  saying I'm calling for violence when I'm calling for the opposite every day in
[02:16:47.160 --> 02:16:51.240]  major newspapers and television why they think their audience are a bunch of
[02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:55.760]  idiots they think their audience is so stupid they won't go find out what
[02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:59.560]  Alex Jones is really saying like I said I watched five minutes of Chris Matthews
[02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:04.680]  last night and everything he said was a lie everything all of his guests it was
[02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:09.600]  like a tree full of parents repeating lies over and over and then they to make
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:14.640]  it worse they were calling us liars everything they were saying was a lie
[02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:23.400]  about the health care bill I've read the stinking thing I'm just ranting I'm
[02:17:23.400 --> 02:17:28.720]  out of control we need to get out of control though when we need to get
[02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:32.520]  angry get out of our comfort zone Leo thank you D in Minnesota you're on the
[02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:39.080]  air hi Alex I was able to go to that Thomas loc.gov and I was able to find
[02:17:39.080 --> 02:17:42.680]  the bill there like you said again you know where to go to get the information
[02:17:42.680 --> 02:17:49.640]  thank you secondly and it was as bad there was death panels and stuff in there
[02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:56.440]  I mean oh it's all death panels and it's all in there I had a question one
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:18:01.640]  comment one thing to report and then a question couple questions actually um
[02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:07.360]  there was a story in Harrett I found it on Al just there and it linked to Harrett
[02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:12.760]  the Israeli army didn't I did an order where they're gonna start evicting
[02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:19.960]  Palestinians that didn't have the court until permit and that means a lot of them
[02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:23.560]  are gonna get evicted the guys you know that's how it works in America now with
[02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:27.600]  zoning they're just taking people's property and land and the thing is they
[02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:32.880]  know that when Israel does this a new war is gonna start and it's it's just
[02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:37.640]  out of control and I thought this needed to be brought up because it was
[02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:42.200]  important it is what they call a lesson at cleansing and it's big and it needed
[02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:46.920]  to be said that being said my question is if I wanted to see the PNAC
[02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:57.680]  documents and if I wanted to see State Department memorandum 200 and where do I
[02:18:57.680 --> 02:19:04.600]  go to see those documents it's all at the Library of Congress it's all at the

[02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:32.640]  uh let's talk to fred in oklahoma fred you're on the air
[02:24:32.640 --> 02:24:36.160]  alex how are you sir i'm doing pretty good because we're having a lot of
[02:24:36.160 --> 02:24:39.760]  victories against the new world order august of o's
[02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:44.160]  oh nine last year uh william jeffson clinton had a sit-down with kim jong
[02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:49.200]  hill you don't think he went on a shopping spree over there do you
[02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:52.000]  you know i don't think they need to shop they've got plenty of nukes over here
[02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.240]  and we already caught shaney trying to sneak out
[02:24:54.240 --> 02:24:57.440]  some cruise missiles uh what three years ago
[02:24:57.440 --> 02:25:03.680]  out of uh the dakotas but who knows what was going on with that meeting
[02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:07.440]  they can trace that stuff down to the element and where it was processed
[02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:11.360]  now they would need that to be processed somewhere other than united states
[02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:17.200]  now if they let one of those things off say in um iraq or or afghanistan and then
[02:25:17.200 --> 02:25:19.440]  later a year later they come to find out that it was
[02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:24.080]  processed in north korea they've got the pretense to the next war
[02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:27.040]  well that's another issue some of the uranium
[02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:30.320]  has been processed for iran in russia and france
[02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:33.600]  so that's another way they could separately sell some of that
[02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:37.520]  to whatever private corporation or black ops group or intelligence agency
[02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:40.960]  was going to stage it but they can also fake
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:44.960]  uh the isotopes they can fake the manufacturing process
[02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:49.280]  and just claim i mean the fbi crime lab we've had the former head of it on about
[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:51.520]  how they how there was so much framing going on
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:55.760]  so that they can just claim i mean they claim there was yellow cake uranium
[02:25:55.760 --> 02:25:59.280]  from niger in iraq they claim there were wmd's
[02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:03.440]  i mean they don't need to uh actually frame someone that way i
[02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:08.000]  i disagree with you all right sir well i like that it was just an idea and
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:13.200]  thanks for all you do and uh i'm a value listener and i i i've tried to pass
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:16.160]  message on to anybody will listen well friend let me add i mean you've got a
[02:26:16.160 --> 02:26:20.240]  good point i mean certainly they could buy it from a third party
[02:26:20.240 --> 02:26:23.760]  in eastern europe in central asia out of russia
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:27.120]  from north korea that's a really good point i mean they could do it
[02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:32.480]  so they legitimately frame somebody and they can prove and not fake the test
[02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:35.040]  and and and then show that it came from somewhere
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:42.560]  that it really didn't my issue is they can also fake evidence fake forensics
[02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:46.640]  yes i think and they've done it before so they've done it before the sky's the
[02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:49.440]  limit with these people and look there's a lot of terror groups
[02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:53.280]  that it comes out later for decades didn't know they were being run by
[02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:57.440]  western intelligence i mean it came out in a few major u.s newspapers
[02:26:57.440 --> 02:27:00.640]  what a week and a half ago but the head of the moon by attacks
[02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:03.600]  was a u.s government agent running the operation that came out in federal
[02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:07.040]  court just like it came out one of the top white supremacist in the country
[02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:12.320]  was actually an fbi agent howl turner at national security level i mean it
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:15.600]  it's just you can't it's it's so incredible
[02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:20.640]  that they just run it i'm hoping they bust somebody sometime that doesn't work
[02:27:20.640 --> 02:27:23.600]  for the globalist i wish it was just rag tag terrorist
[02:27:23.600 --> 02:27:29.280]  i'm not scared of rag tag terrorist but i am concerned about the new world order
[02:27:29.280 --> 02:27:33.280]  let's talk to ken in south carolina ken you're on the air
[02:27:33.280 --> 02:27:38.000]  going hi hi first of all i want to thank you for telling the truth and
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:42.800]  giving the small people like me a chance to go tell the truth to other people
[02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:46.160]  and i can't just how many people i've woken up
[02:27:46.160 --> 02:27:50.640]  i can't thank you enough are you kidding i can't thank you we're all in this
[02:27:50.640 --> 02:27:53.920]  together my friend i know i know you know the first
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:56.960]  time call i'm a little bit nervous and i know i had no reason to be nervous
[02:27:56.960 --> 02:28:00.320]  because the birds of a feather flock together i just want to say this a
[02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:04.400]  comment about the news now why wouldn't they sit off the news here in the u.s
[02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:08.320]  to k that's what the league wants they want the population uh they had to
[02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:12.160]  under underground bunkers we know they had the Denver airport we've got the
[02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:15.680]  fema coltons lined up uh in that like a huge sign
[02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:19.840]  that something is coming very it's a perfect way to roll out the police
[02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:23.360]  state they've already got lined up it's like football teams already lined up
[02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:26.720]  and the quarterbacks going blue 42 blue 42
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:31.040]  huh huh huh and i mean they are ready to go and and
[02:28:31.040 --> 02:28:35.040]  again they have a history of staging stuff they're hyping it it will help
[02:28:35.040 --> 02:28:38.080]  them it's one of the cards they're looking at playing
[02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:41.760]  and that's why they're so mad at 911 truth because now they've got to worry
[02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:45.280]  about a populist that's got their eyes wide open
[02:28:45.280 --> 02:28:49.120]  and who's looking for things like 911 truth or curt haskell
[02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:53.440]  who exposed their entire underwear bombing and it turned out he was right
[02:28:53.440 --> 02:28:56.960]  see we've got our people are everywhere now you understand that
[02:28:56.960 --> 02:29:00.400]  well you know they said they wanted the population now they can just ship whoever's
[02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:04.880]  left i guess that is that is that what they feel
[02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:09.040]  absolutely and again they can set off a dinky nuke
[02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:12.960]  that just blows up maybe 20 30 square blocks radiates part of the city
[02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:17.680]  they'll come in mop it up clean it up and if you think 911 drove a stake through
[02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:23.600]  our heart a nuclear 911 will be a whole order or two
[02:29:23.600 --> 02:29:27.760]  of magnitude increased key points that you made

[02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:06.560]  tinkering shack your work shed whatever and it grabs it
[02:35:06.560 --> 02:35:09.360]  and the smaller units produce seven plus gallons they've got in the produce
[02:35:09.360 --> 02:35:12.960]  hundreds of gallons a day uh they're very affordable and it sends them
[02:35:12.960 --> 02:35:15.920]  through seven to 12 different filters depending on which unit you buy
[02:35:15.920 --> 02:35:18.480]  as if you need a bunch of filters when it's right out of the air the point is
[02:35:18.480 --> 02:35:23.520]  it's it's it's really great water uh and uh you can find out more at

[02:35:41.040 --> 02:35:47.360]  okay let me try to calmly and systematically go over the news
[02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:49.760]  right now
[02:35:51.040 --> 02:35:55.040]  since the forties and fifties the u.s government
[02:35:55.040 --> 02:36:00.000]  in a staged event now has been declassified you heard jessie ventura
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:05.760]  talking about it when he was on with us last week
[02:36:05.760 --> 02:36:09.600]  we had a deal with the russians after world war two with joe stalin that he
[02:36:09.600 --> 02:36:12.160]  would attack a bunch of third world countries we would claim we were
[02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:19.760]  opposing him and then we would attack and invade
[02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:23.120]  countries and then he would claim he was opposing us
[02:36:23.120 --> 02:36:29.120]  remember what adolf a lois hitler did with the russian
[02:36:29.120 --> 02:36:35.680]  nazi pact that was signed what in um 1939
[02:36:35.680 --> 02:36:40.880]  they divided poland a sneak attack from the east the russians
[02:36:40.880 --> 02:36:48.800]  from the west the germans well the cia and others at the end of
[02:36:48.800 --> 02:36:52.080]  world war two the os s and flutcher proudy was the head of
[02:36:52.080 --> 02:36:55.920]  black ops wrote about this but now large portions have been declassified
[02:36:55.920 --> 02:36:59.520]  they put malsey tongue in that's now even on history channel
[02:36:59.520 --> 02:37:05.680]  kick shank i check out uh but the genius of this was the us just can't go
[02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:09.680]  invade countries because the people wouldn't put up
[02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:13.840]  with that we were christian educated informed
[02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:17.920]  patriots who knew what george washington said
[02:37:17.920 --> 02:37:21.440]  see here's the problem i'm trying to get into fake nuclear false flag
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:26.480]  and then i start going through my mental process of how i understand all this
[02:37:26.480 --> 02:37:29.920]  it's just impossible it's it's just there's just so much information
[02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:34.320]  so what would happen is they'd pick korea or they'd pick vietnam
[02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:38.240]  or they'd pick another country and they'd say we're gonna invade here you're
[02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:41.840]  gonna invade there that'll allow us to make a lot of money and
[02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:45.360]  get control of society through weapon sales it will allow us to create a
[02:37:45.360 --> 02:37:48.640]  paramilitary force that we can then use domestically it'll give us
[02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:52.960]  battle-hardened troops in these wartime laboratories as they're called
[02:37:52.960 --> 02:37:56.800]  and so you take half of germany we take the other half
[02:37:56.800 --> 02:38:01.120]  after world war two you take half of korea we take the other half
[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:05.760]  uh we take part of vietnam you take the other half and then we kill each other
[02:38:05.760 --> 02:38:09.680]  but we use that as a political diversion because if the russians are at war
[02:38:09.680 --> 02:38:13.520]  against the americans the russians can oppress their people
[02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:16.800]  because they're in a war and the people go we've got to do what the
[02:38:16.800 --> 02:38:22.160]  commas are say we're in a war same thing in america
[02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:26.320]  and it was win and again this has even been in the new york times you know the
[02:38:26.320 --> 02:38:29.200]  headline mccarthy was right well that was about four years ago the russians
[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:32.480]  declassified that it was all true mccarthy was completely right the us army
[02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:36.080]  was basically funding the communist in russia ran the whole thing gave them
[02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:39.280]  nukes gave them everything mccarthy was great when he was targeting
[02:38:39.280 --> 02:38:44.000]  hollywood people uh to create a censorship system
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:48.080]  and an excuse to set up spies in police state but when he found out
[02:38:48.080 --> 02:38:54.240]  that it was all run by the pentagon politically they slit his throat
[02:38:54.240 --> 02:38:58.400]  that's how sophisticated this is
[02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:03.440]  and it's the same thing with al-qaeda how does the the banking cartel that
[02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:07.680]  dominates the control the west when the french the british the americans we
[02:39:07.680 --> 02:39:10.720]  don't want to go invade and kill brown people we don't want to pay for wars
[02:39:10.720 --> 02:39:13.440]  we don't want to send our sons and daughters off we'll fight in a righteous
[02:39:13.440 --> 02:39:17.840]  war we'll fight today if we're being attacked or invaded
[02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:24.560]  so they stage a terror attack then they hype it as a pretext to continue and
[02:39:24.560 --> 02:39:29.200]  expand those wars now they're going to stage racist events at tea parties
[02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:32.000]  and they've been caught doing it now they're going to stage terror attacks
[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:35.200]  and blaming on conservatives all of you conservatives that bought into this
[02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:38.880]  under bush now you're going to get the other end of it
[02:39:38.880 --> 02:39:43.840]  you better grow up right now okay there's not time for this
[02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:49.520]  stalin captured 22 000 us troops in 1945 in germany this is declassified this is
[02:39:49.520 --> 02:39:52.000]  public
[02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:56.240]  and he said i want for slave labor and eisenhower said sure go ahead
[02:39:56.240 --> 02:39:58.800]  that's what the government thinks of our troops
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:05.520]  in 1945 he was the head general he actually complained about it but
[02:40:05.520 --> 02:40:08.480]  roosevelt well then it was harry truman said go ahead
[02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:12.400]  the point is that's how ruthless these people are
[02:40:12.400 --> 02:40:15.360]  you think harry truman didn't care about hundreds of thousands of japanese
[02:40:15.360 --> 02:40:18.000]  they killed with a bombs when japan was already trying to
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:23.520]  unconditionally surrender they did that
[02:40:23.520 --> 02:40:27.760]  basically like the death star blowing up alderaan in star wars to show people
[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:30.880]  the power of the empire
[02:40:31.520 --> 02:40:36.000]  again using a pop culture analogy for people
[02:40:38.960 --> 02:40:43.280]  this is how they operate this is what they do
[02:40:43.280 --> 02:40:46.000]  you think if they don't care about hundreds of thousands of japanese they
[02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:49.360]  killed on one day mainly women and children
[02:40:49.360 --> 02:40:54.960]  do you then think that they're going to care about 22 000 or 21 000 us troops
[02:40:54.960 --> 02:40:57.920]  oh stalin said i'm going to keep them oh yeah go ahead yeah
[02:40:57.920 --> 02:41:02.720]  us soldiers and nazi camps go ahead and take them
[02:41:02.720 --> 02:41:06.560]  now you remember that cops and military and don't sit there and tell me it isn't
[02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:09.920]  true don't you dare in sitting there in your
[02:41:09.920 --> 02:41:14.800]  ignorance neck deep in the sess of your ignorance
[02:41:14.800 --> 02:41:18.400]  with all sorts of detritus floating around you in your ignorant brain
[02:41:18.400 --> 02:41:21.520]  don't you sit there and say i'm making that up punk
[02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:25.120]  i'm talking to you out there that are in denial that think you're patriots you
[02:41:25.120 --> 02:41:29.920]  go look up what i just told you and find out it's true
[02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:34.080]  don't you just sit there and say i'm lying about it
[02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:39.280]  face it you mean nothing to these people
[02:41:39.280 --> 02:41:44.640]  nothing nothing nothing nothing you're with us the people whether you know it
[02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:50.720]  or like it so again i'll tell you two sides
[02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:54.640]  i have studied the enemy's blueprints i have studied their declassified
[02:41:54.640 --> 02:41:56.960]  documents i know how their mind works think about that
[02:41:56.960 --> 02:42:00.240]  they get with the russians and they say how do we carve up the world together
[02:42:00.240 --> 02:42:02.880]  we've been allies throughout this war with the nazis
[02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:06.480]  we want to create collectivism too in fact the bankers that run america
[02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:12.400]  funded your predecessor linen uh how do we get this done
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:15.600]  and their psych warfare experts came in and said you set up a police state and
[02:42:15.600 --> 02:42:18.720]  collectivism under the name of fighting communism
[02:42:18.720 --> 02:42:22.480]  and then we invade countries under the name of fighting you and then you
[02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:27.200]  invade and then we always divide the land between each other
[02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:30.640]  that's why there's a deal to give the communist chinese
[02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:34.480]  in 1979 the panama canal when we built it for no reason
[02:42:34.480 --> 02:42:38.720]  wouldn't even let us companies bet on it that's why they give the communist
[02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:42.400]  chinese and the russians uh the drilling rights off our coast but won't
[02:42:42.400 --> 02:42:46.240]  give our own companies that that's why they give tax incentives for us
[02:42:46.240 --> 02:42:50.240]  companies to leave and go to china this is all a master plan
[02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:53.120]  that is stated
[02:42:54.080 --> 02:42:57.520]  that's the thing i mean thousands and thousands and thousands of their
[02:42:57.520 --> 02:43:01.040]  blueprints have fallen into our hands that's what's so frustrating here
[02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:09.040]  this is not our opinion it's it's got to stop
[02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:15.600]  so here's the deal since the 40s and 50s they had been teaching everybody we're
[02:43:15.600 --> 02:43:17.840]  going to be nuked as an excuse to set up a police
[02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:20.560]  state and they've ingrained that in our psyche
[02:43:20.560 --> 02:43:25.120]  and i've seen thousands of different factors coinciding
[02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:30.720]  in in a political future vortex
[02:43:31.520 --> 02:43:34.880]  and this isn't mumbo jumbo this is political deep research
[02:43:34.880 --> 02:43:38.480]  integrating all the information
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:44.240]  thousands of points that go into it that there is a distinct
[02:43:44.240 --> 02:43:47.680]  possibility i've been saying this for many years
[02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:51.440]  that the establishment will stage a nuclear 9-11
[02:43:51.440 --> 02:43:54.560]  and now they've been hyping it for eight years saying it's not a question of if
[02:43:54.560 --> 02:43:58.400]  but when nukes go off and the cfr has even bragged
[02:43:58.400 --> 02:44:02.800]  and said al-qaeda will probably hit denver dalis
[02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:08.480]  cleveland and one other city that's meant to scare their buddies
[02:44:08.480 --> 02:44:12.160]  when the cfr members gary hart warren rudman and others get up
[02:44:12.160 --> 02:44:15.600]  and predict an attack on the world trade center and the police state will follow
[02:44:15.600 --> 02:44:18.800]  for our own good that's showing off and that's why they all
[02:44:18.800 --> 02:44:22.800]  gasp whenever a month ago bill gates got up and said carbon
[02:44:22.800 --> 02:44:26.160]  dioxide's what humans put out we've got to cut the human population
[02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:29.440]  everyone gasped and giggled and clapped it was like a little demonic
[02:44:29.440 --> 02:44:32.240]  celebration oh we're here on the inside group
[02:44:32.240 --> 02:44:37.440]  ooh we feel powerful it's our little power fetish
[02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:44.720]  talking about killing people in mass we're control freak cult
[02:44:44.720 --> 02:44:49.200]  and gates all got this demonic smile and like was just shivering with
[02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:54.560]  i'm giving all my money to kill people and i'm telling them it's to help them
[02:44:54.560 --> 02:44:58.560]  i mean i have to sit here and see the psychopaths in big
[02:44:58.560 --> 02:45:01.840]  big groups like a group of black birds
[02:45:01.840 --> 02:45:05.200]  or carrion crows in a field picking our flesh and i have to
[02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:09.840]  see all the stupid soccer moms and joe six pack believing all the garbage
[02:45:09.840 --> 02:45:13.200]  and i have to watch you being financially destroyed i have to watch them
[02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:16.720]  poisoning your water i have to watch all this happening to you
[02:45:16.720 --> 02:45:23.440]  every day knowing how real it is knowing it's 110 percent
[02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:26.960]  so indescribable i can't even tell you people think i'm exaggerating you have
[02:45:26.960 --> 02:45:30.160]  no idea how bad it is i said i'd cover news and i'm not
[02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:33.440]  doing it am i i'm just ranting because it's just
[02:45:33.440 --> 02:45:40.400]  it's just so fundamental the once you get wicked people in government
[02:45:40.400 --> 02:45:45.920]  once you get corrupt systems in they just recruit more and more
[02:45:45.920 --> 02:45:48.800]  evil and then they compete with each other and it gets more and more wicked
[02:45:48.800 --> 02:45:52.960]  more and more sadistic more and more psychopathic that's history folks
[02:45:52.960 --> 02:46:01.840]  and it's it's high tech it's here a high tech overlay
[02:46:05.120 --> 02:46:08.480]  they want to invade iran they want to set up a domestic police state
[02:46:08.480 --> 02:46:11.440]  they want to be able to steal the pension funds during the crisis they've
[02:46:11.440 --> 02:46:16.240]  got the mobile checkpoint processing units with the body scanners and brain
[02:46:16.240 --> 02:46:19.200]  scanners rolling out we've shown you the homeland security videos
[02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:22.960]  they want to fully federalize everything and give the federal contracts to
[02:46:22.960 --> 02:46:28.800]  select group of corporations and they need a nuke attack if i was them
[02:46:28.800 --> 02:46:33.120]  and i'm able to step into their their their battle
[02:46:33.120 --> 02:46:37.520]  command system i can i can see what they're doing the different plays they've
[02:46:37.520 --> 02:46:42.400]  got the different options the different programs and if you study this you can
[02:46:42.400 --> 02:46:47.600]  too and i can step into their world view and and and how they think and i can
[02:46:47.600 --> 02:46:51.920]  tell you they've got a fistful of cards and they've got that nuke
[02:46:51.920 --> 02:46:55.680]  false flag nuke attack right there in their hand do they just hype it as a
[02:46:55.680 --> 02:46:58.160]  psychological threat they're already doing that
[02:46:58.160 --> 02:47:02.640]  they've already played that do they bust somebody some patsies
[02:47:02.640 --> 02:47:08.080]  and claim that they had a nuke because the people are waking up to them they
[02:47:08.080 --> 02:47:12.000]  need something spectacular or do they detonate
[02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:17.600]  one weapon multiple weapons why is the government committing political
[02:47:17.600 --> 02:47:21.840]  suicide in a republic in a in a representative system they're
[02:47:21.840 --> 02:47:24.320]  all going to be out of office why don't they care
[02:47:24.320 --> 02:47:29.200]  why do they just rush forward on every front why
[02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:33.840]  because they know they've got the ace in the hole
[02:47:33.840 --> 02:47:39.040]  they've got the royal flush they got nukes and as another card to suppress
[02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:42.480]  their political enemies they're now teaching the school kids and the people
[02:47:42.480 --> 02:47:45.200]  on the news everyone who doesn't like the fellow
[02:47:45.200 --> 02:47:48.480]  reserve is a nazi hates black people
[02:47:48.480 --> 02:47:52.000]  anyone that talks about fluoride in your water is a nazi and hates black people
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.720]  anybody that doesn't want government-run healthcare is a nazi and hates black
[02:47:54.720 --> 02:47:58.000]  people makes no sense until you realize the
[02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.720]  programming and and the brainwash mass they're
[02:48:00.720 --> 02:48:03.200]  talking to
[02:48:04.800 --> 02:48:09.520]  and so we know they've already played the fake nuke card
[02:48:09.520 --> 02:48:13.280]  psychologically will they play it for real i've been telling you
[02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:17.520]  for now several years that they are going to demonize the patriot movement
[02:48:17.520 --> 02:48:20.640]  and and now in the last year and a half the tea party movement and stage
[02:48:20.640 --> 02:48:24.080]  events and say you're terrorist and say you're white al-qaeda and stage some
[02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:26.960]  fake raids on militias and people to create the illusion that there's this
[02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:32.640]  dangerous threat in the preparatory phase leading up to the staged event
[02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:37.920]  and everything i was looking for for them to do
[02:48:37.920 --> 02:48:41.520]  has happened exactly as we said because it's a playbook
[02:48:41.520 --> 02:48:45.600]  and i'm sitting here watching them run a playbook on us
[02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:52.560]  and i know exactly what they're going to do and i'm telling you
[02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:57.760]  they're probably going to set nukes off okay i just want you to know that
[02:48:57.760 --> 02:49:01.680]  unless we get the word out about false flag terror
[02:49:01.680 --> 02:49:04.400]  and all you good old boys that are scared of what your church is going to say
[02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:06.000]  or scared of what your neighbor is going to think
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:10.080]  you better just stop caring what people think okay you better grow up
[02:49:10.080 --> 02:49:13.760]  the first thing about being a man or being a woman and being a strong person
[02:49:13.760 --> 02:49:15.920]  is that when you're in the right and you know you're right
[02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:19.680]  i don't care if i was on a stage with 10 000 people spitting at me and throwing
[02:49:19.680 --> 02:49:24.400]  tomatoes at me i don't care if i'm telling the truth
[02:49:24.400 --> 02:49:27.200]  i don't care they stripped me butt naked and marched me out
[02:49:27.200 --> 02:49:30.480]  and throw horse manure on me i could care less because i know i'm right
[02:49:30.480 --> 02:49:34.800]  and i don't care what those cowards and and and people who aren't in the arena
[02:49:34.800 --> 02:49:37.280]  think i could literally care less
[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:44.800]  grow up folks in your gut you know it's false flag you know it's all staged
[02:49:44.800 --> 02:49:51.920]  i got the democrats in the ap staging racism events to blame it on us
[02:49:51.920 --> 02:49:55.120]  that's all these people do is frame us we're the good people
[02:49:55.120 --> 02:49:58.480]  they're the scum look at their fruits look at everything
[02:49:58.480 --> 02:50:02.320]  these controllers do and then i hear obama say
[02:50:02.320 --> 02:50:05.680]  no longer are we worried about state to state nuclear war country to country
[02:50:05.680 --> 02:50:09.920]  we're worried about terror and it's the number one threat facing the us
[02:50:09.920 --> 02:50:13.360]  and they are the terrorists so they're telling you we are the terrorist
[02:50:13.360 --> 02:50:16.560]  this is going to be our game plan this is how we're going to reshuffle the world
[02:50:16.560 --> 02:50:20.080]  and relaunch our operation
[02:50:20.480 --> 02:50:23.840]  and so they're preparing to stage nuke attacks
[02:50:23.840 --> 02:50:28.480]  and blame an iran it's like they claim sedom had nukes and was gonna nuke us
[02:50:28.480 --> 02:50:31.520]  people won't believe it this time they've got to have a nuke attack so i'm
[02:50:31.520 --> 02:50:34.400]  telling you they've got the card in the poker game
[02:50:34.400 --> 02:50:38.400]  and they are just about to lay that card down
[02:50:38.400 --> 02:50:41.360]  and we better say hey i'm not playing cards with you anymore

[02:54:25.200 --> 02:54:28.880]  in south oceania and our news said the russians had attacked
[02:54:28.880 --> 02:54:32.080]  when it was all over the far news that georgia had attacked
[02:54:32.080 --> 02:54:36.560]  then u.s. nato aircraft were flying in to back them up and russia rolled over
[02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:40.240]  the border with mobile nuke vehicles with medium-range nukes
[02:54:40.240 --> 02:54:43.840]  and their head general their chairman of their joint chiefs came on and said we

[02:55:10.480 --> 02:55:14.160]  the insurance companies and then he says oh the greatest threat in the
[02:55:14.160 --> 02:55:18.800]  world is al-qaeda with nukes hitting the united states or other countries
[02:55:18.800 --> 02:55:22.080]  and we've got to have a global regime to stop it i.e. police state
[02:55:22.080 --> 02:55:25.680]  over everyone and all the borders letting all the illegals in but controlling
[02:55:25.680 --> 02:55:29.520]  the citizens this is a global regime we got to have a global regime for the

[02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:49.600]  regime to tackle climate change we have that other un document about

[02:55:52.240 --> 02:55:55.760]  then we have the copenhagen document that said the same thing a tyrannical
[02:55:55.760 --> 02:55:58.720]  world government
[02:55:59.840 --> 02:56:04.560]  and environmentalism is their front again it's another false flag it isn't

[02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:13.520]  industry all locomotion everything and they pick it so they can run
[02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:16.160]  every fast for your life i mean it's elementary
[02:56:16.160 --> 02:56:19.840]  it's two plus two equals four it's not even two plus two equals four
[02:56:19.840 --> 02:56:25.120]  it's one plus one i mean i i've got a two-year-old and i can say what is one
[02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:29.840]  plus one she goes two two that sweet little voice and i almost cry every
[02:56:29.840 --> 02:56:33.680]  time i look at her knowing the world she lives in
[02:56:33.680 --> 02:56:39.600]  but the public goes oh i can't do two plus two i can't do one plus one i can't

[02:56:56.400 --> 02:57:00.320]  they think you're a bunch of gullible morons you know how risky it is for the
[02:57:00.320 --> 02:57:05.440]  black congressional congress caucus and congress to go stage an
[02:57:05.440 --> 02:57:08.400]  event and claim they were called the n word on video when they weren't and
[02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:11.680]  claim they were spit on when they weren't you know how risky it is for the
[02:57:11.680 --> 02:57:15.120]  democratic party to attack their own offices in denver that's denver post
[02:57:15.120 --> 02:57:18.960]  you know how risky it is for them to have their people planted with n word
[02:57:18.960 --> 02:57:22.240]  signs at tea parties they don't care if they get caught
[02:57:22.240 --> 02:57:24.960]  this is a group of revolutionary criminals that are going to do whatever
[02:57:24.960 --> 02:57:28.880]  they want they're a bunch of blowdown stinking snakes
[02:57:28.880 --> 02:57:33.120]  scum filth and the republican party newt
[02:57:33.120 --> 02:57:37.920]  genrich who supports value-added taxes and global greenhouse gas taxes and is
[02:57:37.920 --> 02:57:42.080]  one of the peanut masterminds of 9 11 running around
[02:57:42.080 --> 02:57:47.760]  talking about how he's fighting obama when obama was put in power by his
[02:57:47.760 --> 02:57:53.280]  handlers and he knows full well it's all a bunch of theater
[02:57:53.280 --> 02:57:56.960]  now that's a little harder for people to get that's more like five plus five
[02:57:56.960 --> 02:57:59.680]  equals 10
[02:58:01.360 --> 02:58:05.040]  oh and watson comes on we're going to get into all of this foes of tea party

[03:00:34.080 --> 03:00:38.240]  tea parties and pose as racist that's now in the ap
[03:00:38.240 --> 03:00:42.720]  with the name we fingered jason levin and others
[03:00:42.720 --> 03:00:46.880]  that's coming up also all over the country from texas to ohio
[03:00:46.880 --> 03:00:50.240]  they're shutting down police departments cutting sheriff's departments by half and
[03:00:50.240 --> 03:00:52.800]  saying you need to arm yourselves to protect
[03:00:52.800 --> 03:00:55.360]  yourself everything's going to the bankers now
[03:00:55.360 --> 03:01:00.640]  nothing for services economist doctor of history webster griffin tarpley
[03:01:00.640 --> 03:01:04.400]  joins us for this segment part of the next uh and then i'm going to
[03:01:04.400 --> 03:01:07.920]  continue into the news and then watson's joining us but i wanted to get him on
[03:01:07.920 --> 03:01:11.360]  about the kazinski twins and this mysterious
[03:01:11.360 --> 03:01:15.360]  downing saturday of much of the polish government's leadership
[03:01:15.360 --> 03:01:19.440]  is russia behind it is nato behind it or is it a malfunction
[03:01:19.440 --> 03:01:23.440]  we talked to uh colonel uh schaefer yesterday he said it
[03:01:23.440 --> 03:01:28.800]  looks like dirty work by somebody uh and and he suspects russia
[03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:32.240]  the twins had made russia mad moving missiles in and things
[03:01:32.240 --> 03:01:35.920]  but also last week the uh president said
[03:01:35.920 --> 03:01:38.880]  that he was going and this is also the new york times
[03:01:38.880 --> 03:01:41.920]  that he was going to devalue their currency against the euro and start
[03:01:41.920 --> 03:01:44.720]  pulling out of the euro if that happened the euro would be dead
[03:01:44.720 --> 03:01:48.320]  george sorrow said that last week and boom the president and much of the
[03:01:48.320 --> 03:01:52.640]  leadership dies webster tarpley what's your take on this
[03:01:52.640 --> 03:01:57.520]  well hi alex uh obviously it's uh it's a great tragedy now it in terms of who
[03:01:57.520 --> 03:02:00.640]  might be doing this right if we think that this was not
[03:02:00.640 --> 03:02:06.800]  just the plane crashing in the fog um on the surface there are four attempts
[03:02:06.800 --> 03:02:10.560]  by the plane to land at a uh not well developed
[03:02:10.560 --> 03:02:14.240]  airport right smoliansk is is one of those european airports that doesn't
[03:02:14.240 --> 03:02:17.600]  have all the equipment for landing in fog so usually you have to have
[03:02:17.600 --> 03:02:21.200]  visibility to land they they crash on the fourth approach
[03:02:21.200 --> 03:02:24.400]  after dumping a significant part of their fuel
[03:02:24.400 --> 03:02:27.680]  and when the russians were telling them don't land here
[03:02:27.680 --> 03:02:32.000]  go to minsk or go to moscow and then take some kind of
[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:35.520]  ground transportation but that of course would have made them miss this
[03:02:35.520 --> 03:02:39.760]  ceremony at the cut-in forest and the commemoration of the 20 000
[03:02:39.760 --> 03:02:45.920]  polish officers massacred uh by Stalin so hypothetically what could it be
[03:02:45.920 --> 03:02:49.840]  um this guy kachinsky is a politician who
[03:02:49.840 --> 03:02:54.640]  built his house on russophobia on on being anti russian
[03:02:54.640 --> 03:02:59.280]  he was also anti-german he picked all kinds of fights with germany he was
[03:02:59.280 --> 03:03:03.600]  always willing to pull out the uh tragic past of poland vis-a-vis
[03:03:03.600 --> 03:03:08.320]  russia vis-a-vis germany uh when he got into uh negotiations
[03:03:08.320 --> 03:03:12.000]  and the thing that that gives him that puts him in a better light is that he
[03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:15.520]  was also against the lisbon treaty he was one of
[03:03:15.520 --> 03:03:18.640]  the last uh heads of state in europe to sign
[03:03:18.640 --> 03:03:21.840]  this oppressive and uh and oligarchical
[03:03:21.840 --> 03:03:26.560]  lisbon treaty that went into force last year and as far as i know poland
[03:03:26.560 --> 03:03:29.440]  uh has not joined the euro they still uh
[03:03:29.440 --> 03:03:33.120]  have their own currency no but by dropping it they say that would affect
[03:03:33.120 --> 03:03:35.840]  the euro zone because it was pegged to the euro
[03:03:35.840 --> 03:03:40.240]  yes well obviously when countries get into difficulty it's very traditional
[03:03:40.240 --> 03:03:44.160]  and very standard to devalue the currency if you have some kind of a debt
[03:03:44.160 --> 03:03:47.920]  crisis you can devalue your currency most people would say if greece for
[03:03:47.920 --> 03:03:51.280]  example were not part of the euro they would simply
[03:03:51.280 --> 03:03:54.400]  devalue the drachma which doesn't exist anymore
[03:03:54.400 --> 03:03:58.000]  and that would be a way out for them devaluing the currency though means
[03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:01.280]  that the standard of living of the people goes down
[03:04:01.280 --> 03:04:05.760]  because they get paid in slotty and that means they can buy much less it might
[03:04:05.760 --> 03:04:10.320]  mean that exports would be boosted but the the cost of living for the
[03:04:10.320 --> 03:04:13.680]  average person goes up so let's not make anybody a hero
[03:04:13.680 --> 03:04:17.920]  about devaluing this this lotty i don't see i wasn't making him a hero that's
[03:04:17.920 --> 03:04:21.040]  what they said that he was at odds with europe about
[03:04:21.040 --> 03:04:25.760]  sure um so there are again there are two two possibilities
[03:04:25.760 --> 03:04:30.160]  one is with russia uh he of course has given the russians a hard time for
[03:04:30.160 --> 03:04:35.040]  for many many years on the other hand what he's gained by making him into a
[03:04:35.040 --> 03:04:38.000]  martyr especially at the point where he's going to be
[03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:42.160]  leaving office in the autumn in other words the the his term
[03:04:42.160 --> 03:04:45.840]  is basically going to come to an end and there's going to be a new election
[03:04:45.840 --> 03:04:50.240]  so that the west could have done that to get support for another kazinski i
[03:04:50.240 --> 03:04:54.480]  to be put into power it's possible but again he's on his way out and the next
[03:04:54.480 --> 03:04:56.880]  guy is komorovsky from the russian point of view
[03:04:56.880 --> 03:05:00.960]  stay there stay there let's let's let's finish up
[03:05:00.960 --> 03:05:06.720]  one major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system the main
[03:05:06.720 --> 03:05:09.120]  event is the the wholesale destruction of the world

[03:08:23.200 --> 03:08:29.760]  geopolitical strategist author lecture essayist a doctorate in history
[03:08:29.760 --> 03:08:36.800]  and an economist webster griffin tarpley is our guest just for this segment
[03:08:36.800 --> 03:08:39.760]  then i'm going to get into foes of tea party movement to infiltrate round
[03:08:39.760 --> 03:08:43.200]  these poses racist yeah you heard that here weeks ago
[03:08:43.200 --> 03:08:46.800]  but now it's in the ap so this this is a big victory
[03:08:46.800 --> 03:08:49.680]  but i wanted to finish up with webster for those that just joined us we're
[03:08:49.680 --> 03:08:53.840]  talking about the president of poland much of the military leadership going
[03:08:53.840 --> 03:08:57.200]  down in russia four attempts to land they told them don't
[03:08:57.200 --> 03:09:02.720]  land here in heavy fog and so webster you're saying the jury is out it's a
[03:09:02.720 --> 03:09:06.640]  bit suspicious but it also looks like they were very stubborn
[03:09:06.640 --> 03:09:10.480]  yeah i think so now here's a here's a comparison okay if you want to look at a
[03:09:10.480 --> 03:09:15.280]  case of somebody inside the european union who was giving the european union
[03:09:15.280 --> 03:09:21.280]  a hard time you can look at this guy hyder h a i d e r of austria
[03:09:21.280 --> 03:09:24.720]  who was a right-wing politician with the main thing being
[03:09:24.720 --> 03:09:29.680]  anti-foreigner um stuff and this was in southern austria now
[03:09:29.680 --> 03:09:36.400]  he had died in a very very suspicious automobile crash in october of 2008
[03:09:36.400 --> 03:09:40.880]  after winning an election at a time when he was going to be a kingmaker
[03:09:40.880 --> 03:09:44.800]  despite a giant demonization campaign the media that he was a non-c
[03:09:44.800 --> 03:09:48.400]  yeah with all kinds of things going on against him and i don't i
[03:09:48.400 --> 03:09:52.480]  doesn't seem to me that the nazi charge is is really based on anything it was
[03:09:52.480 --> 03:09:56.800]  simply that he was he was a unoskeptic he was against the lisbon treaty he was
[03:09:56.800 --> 03:10:01.040]  not happy with a a lot of things going on in brussels but notice the difference
[03:10:01.040 --> 03:10:04.800]  is that he was he was taken out of the picture right after winning a very
[03:10:04.800 --> 03:10:08.400]  important election when everybody knew that the next government of austria
[03:10:08.400 --> 03:10:12.160]  would be profoundly influenced by him there's a book by garhard fisnevsky
[03:10:12.160 --> 03:10:16.240]  about this which is only in uh in german so far as i know but it's a it's a very
[03:10:16.240 --> 03:10:22.000]  very good investigation uh in the case of of uh kachinsky now let kachinsky
[03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:25.760]  he's basically on his way out his his brother had also been the
[03:10:25.760 --> 03:10:29.840]  prime minister of poland right yet the kachinsky twins one president one
[03:10:29.840 --> 03:10:34.080]  one prime minister for a couple of years uh the other brother had been kicked out
[03:10:34.080 --> 03:10:37.040]  as prime minister and replaced by this guy tusk
[03:10:37.040 --> 03:10:41.200]  who is is more conciliatory to russia and also to the
[03:10:41.200 --> 03:10:45.600]  european union and now uh the the other kachinsky is
[03:10:45.600 --> 03:10:50.640]  is now gone i just don't see the case uh then there was the kui bono right the
[03:10:50.640 --> 03:10:54.080]  who benefits this this doesn't seem to me to be that uh
[03:10:54.080 --> 03:10:57.440]  that obvious though i guess you keep an open mind and see what happened there
[03:10:57.440 --> 03:11:01.920]  there will be continuing investigation which apparently is being done jointly
[03:11:01.920 --> 03:11:06.400]  by the russians and the polls so that the polls can satisfy themselves that
[03:11:06.400 --> 03:11:11.040]  that uh well as as to what went on all right let's shift gears into the main
[03:11:11.040 --> 03:11:14.000]  subject and i haven't asked your opinion on this
[03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:20.080]  we will find out now if you concur but we know bush played the nuclear 911
[03:11:20.080 --> 03:11:24.320]  card uh we know that uh well i believe that they
[03:11:24.320 --> 03:11:28.480]  may do it now they've replaced the r with a q
[03:11:28.480 --> 03:11:34.480]  in iraq to iran uh or they replaced uh the q with an n
[03:11:34.480 --> 03:11:39.120]  and it's the same propaganda uh obama saying when number one threat
[03:11:39.120 --> 03:11:44.160]  is non-state actor terrorism uh he says we're not worried about country to
[03:11:44.160 --> 03:11:47.680]  country having uh nuclear exchanges we're
[03:11:47.680 --> 03:11:50.960]  worried about iran running al-qaeda and new king
[03:11:50.960 --> 03:11:55.520]  america which is asinine on so many fronts al-qaeda is a ci creation iran's
[03:11:55.520 --> 03:11:59.920]  anti al-qaeda Shiite uh but it's a total replay of this
[03:11:59.920 --> 03:12:03.120]  in the lead-up and then we have media dev coming out and saying look
[03:12:03.120 --> 03:12:07.120]  this could cause world war three that's in herettes the big paper out of israel
[03:12:07.120 --> 03:12:12.800]  media dev israel strike on iran could spark global catastrophe or armageddon
[03:12:12.800 --> 03:12:16.000]  and so uh let's break this down do you concur
[03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:20.320]  that they could play a nuclear armageddon card or regardless
[03:12:20.320 --> 03:12:24.400]  just by putting it out there it's psychological terrorism
[03:12:24.400 --> 03:12:30.720]  invoking this fear at a time uh when the globalist agenda is stalling i think
[03:12:30.720 --> 03:12:34.560]  that's that's quite accurate um the big thing that has changed remember is that
[03:12:34.560 --> 03:12:37.840]  there was an attempt to have a color revolution
[03:12:37.840 --> 03:12:43.360]  cia people power coup inside iran in other words to put the u.s. puppet regime
[03:12:43.360 --> 03:12:47.280]  into power in tehran with this green revolution of musa v
[03:12:47.280 --> 03:12:50.400]  and robson johnny and as far as i can see this has failed
[03:12:50.400 --> 03:12:54.960]  and therefore the u.s. and the british are reversing their field and going back
[03:12:54.960 --> 03:13:00.000]  to the more bush neocon policy but with a with a regional
[03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:03.680]  um aspect to it which is which is new i would say that the
[03:13:03.680 --> 03:13:07.760]  the danger of false flag now especially targeting iran is
[03:13:07.760 --> 03:13:11.360]  uh is very high it had been low for about two years
[03:13:11.360 --> 03:13:15.280]  but i think now it's it's rising rapidly and everybody has to take this
[03:13:15.280 --> 03:13:19.440]  very seriously the goal of this conference that's going on in washington
[03:13:19.440 --> 03:13:23.280]  right now is to fashion a cloak of credibility
[03:13:23.280 --> 03:13:26.800]  for a worldwide effort to gang up on iran
[03:13:26.800 --> 03:13:31.520]  and especially to create a kind of anti iranian front in the middle east
[03:13:31.520 --> 03:13:35.120]  uh and this is also the diplomacy vis-a-vis netanyahu
[03:13:35.120 --> 03:13:39.040]  it is that obama wants to create and his handlers above all
[03:13:39.040 --> 03:13:42.720]  an alliance of countries that would be arab and
[03:13:42.720 --> 03:13:47.200]  sunni against the iranians who are of course persians
[03:13:47.200 --> 03:13:52.080]  and shia it so the idea is to assemble Saudi Arabia the gulf states right the
[03:13:52.080 --> 03:13:56.640]  gulf cooperation council try to peel off jordan try to peel off
[03:13:56.640 --> 03:14:00.800]  Syria try to get other countries and i think that's essentially what's going
[03:14:00.800 --> 03:14:03.360]  on uh in washington what do you have in
[03:14:03.360 --> 03:14:06.800]  washington right now looks very much like the league of the democracies that
[03:14:06.800 --> 03:14:10.320]  was talked about in the uh in the election campaign
[03:14:10.320 --> 03:14:14.160]  most notable is who is not here iran is not here
[03:14:14.160 --> 03:14:18.800]  north korea is not here syria not here venezuela not here
[03:14:18.800 --> 03:14:23.920]  um bolivia not here how about niger right remember that the famous niger yellow
[03:14:23.920 --> 03:14:28.800]  cake memorandum in the valerie plain uh saga right older in the
[03:14:28.800 --> 03:14:33.760]  the bush administration well niger big uh producer of yellow cake uranium
[03:14:33.760 --> 03:14:37.600]  would be key for any kind of you know anti nuclear strategy
[03:14:37.600 --> 03:14:42.000]  niger in dc what's the overall mood i mean it seems they're now going into
[03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:45.920]  desperation they forced through the health care but now people are finding
[03:14:45.920 --> 03:14:49.360]  out at lower standard of care and is a big payoff to the banks and
[03:14:49.360 --> 03:14:53.360]  insurance companies well this this thing with obama is largely
[03:14:53.360 --> 03:14:58.640]  a uh it's a photo opportunity uh and again you can say well you've got a
[03:14:58.640 --> 03:15:01.520]  lot of people are here right the countries that are here
[03:15:01.520 --> 03:15:06.080]  egypt morocco algeria those are countries that they'd like to lure into
[03:15:06.080 --> 03:15:11.360]  this anti iranian front uh you've got who of china is here
[03:15:11.360 --> 03:15:16.640]  with china they're trying to get china to go along with sanctions against iran
[03:15:16.640 --> 03:15:19.760]  and there are lots and lots of press reports saying all of the chinese are
[03:15:19.760 --> 03:15:24.080]  going to approve sanctions against iran there is no sign of this whatsoever
[03:15:24.080 --> 03:15:28.800]  how big of a defeat is it that netanyahu wouldn't come because he knew that
[03:15:28.800 --> 03:15:32.080]  egypt and turkey we're going to go okay we'll put
[03:15:32.080 --> 03:15:36.320]  sanctions on iran there's no evidence they have a weapons program
[03:15:36.320 --> 03:15:39.520]  but we know you've got nukes let's talk about that
[03:15:39.520 --> 03:15:43.680]  well of course the israelis have have a four or five hundred or six hundred
[03:15:43.680 --> 03:15:47.440]  nuclear weapons they probably have thermonuclear weapons they probably have
[03:15:47.440 --> 03:15:51.760]  um uh hydrogen bombs the israelis of course are here
[03:15:51.760 --> 03:15:54.800]  just netanyahu is not here i think the guy is uh
[03:15:54.800 --> 03:16:01.600]  meridor is the the israeli uh delegate israel in order to assemble this front
[03:16:01.600 --> 03:16:05.680]  of arabs and sunnis against the iranian
[03:16:05.680 --> 03:16:12.240]  chiites israel is expected to make concessions that will calm down the
[03:16:12.240 --> 03:16:17.120]  question with the palestinians in other words obama's line to netanyahu is
[03:16:17.120 --> 03:16:20.640]  you should basically patch things up with the palestinians
[03:16:20.640 --> 03:16:24.320]  and now let's go on then to deal with your real problem which is
[03:16:24.320 --> 03:16:28.000]  iran in other words your little problem is the palestinians
[03:16:28.000 --> 03:16:31.840]  do something to to uh to call israel saying they're going to continue the
[03:16:31.840 --> 03:16:34.560]  settlements they're saying they're going to continue but but but but we'll have a
[03:16:34.560 --> 03:16:37.840]  few minutes left here webster let's go back to the main issue in hand
[03:16:37.840 --> 03:16:42.240]  obama's main talking point and main statement at the center
[03:16:42.240 --> 03:16:47.040]  of this photo op is the number one threat is al qaeda
[03:16:47.040 --> 03:16:50.240]  they work with iran and they're going to nuke us any minute
[03:16:50.240 --> 03:16:54.240]  how would you see a false flag nuke deployed
[03:16:54.240 --> 03:16:58.480]  well in any number of ways we look at biden
[03:16:58.480 --> 03:17:05.120]  biden has said in the past week that nuclear war is more likely now than ever
[03:17:05.120 --> 03:17:09.360]  before in history because of the the probability of
[03:17:09.360 --> 03:17:14.320]  non-state actors getting nuclear devices and obama is talking
[03:17:14.320 --> 03:17:19.440]  not just nuke nuclear terrorism in general but al qaeda al qaeda al qaeda
[03:17:19.440 --> 03:17:23.200]  is channeling bush and cheney once again so um
[03:17:23.200 --> 03:17:27.280]  you know mega imagination run wild the main thing is
[03:17:27.280 --> 03:17:31.360]  if any nuclear device goes off anywhere in the world
[03:17:31.360 --> 03:17:37.120]  don't think iran think false flag done by the people who are going to benefit
[03:17:37.120 --> 03:17:40.480]  from this um notice that the the other thing that's
[03:17:40.480 --> 03:17:44.400]  going on is you've got the whole echelon crew right the british
[03:17:44.400 --> 03:17:48.560]  canada australia new zealand they're all here
[03:17:48.560 --> 03:17:51.520]  uh the main europeans are here right france
[03:17:51.520 --> 03:17:57.120]  italy germany um so it's again it's the league of democracies it's the it's
[03:17:57.120 --> 03:18:02.640]  the group of sort of pro-us diehard the people who are willing to talk at
[03:18:02.640 --> 03:18:05.840]  least uh i would say it's the league of democracies
[03:18:05.840 --> 03:18:09.520]  plus the the five permanent members but i think the message is the script
[03:18:09.520 --> 03:18:12.400]  obama and the anglo americans are putting out is
[03:18:12.400 --> 03:18:15.360]  we're going to stage a false flag i mean all these politicians understand the
[03:18:15.360 --> 03:18:18.000]  real message we're going to stage a false flag
[03:18:18.000 --> 03:18:21.280]  we're gearing up for iraq too but on a bigger scale
[03:18:21.280 --> 03:18:27.040]  with iran yes and um that that can that can probably be now a question of
[03:18:27.040 --> 03:18:31.840]  month obviously the thing to do is uh take a look at the calendar
[03:18:31.840 --> 03:18:35.360]  look at the time of the new moon right if wars are going to begin
[03:18:35.360 --> 03:18:38.400]  in the middle east you've got to find a time when there's no moon because the
[03:18:38.400 --> 03:18:42.720]  stealth bombers and the cruise missiles are visible at night so if there's a
[03:18:42.720 --> 03:18:45.600]  bright a bright full moon that's not going to be then
[03:18:45.600 --> 03:18:48.880]  it's going to be sometime dark and if it's going to be in the uh in the
[03:18:48.880 --> 03:18:51.680]  springtime it's going to have to be uh at you know at
[03:18:51.680 --> 03:18:56.480]  according to that that calendar so work with that and i would urge everybody
[03:18:56.480 --> 03:19:00.400]  to be on a special alert there were there was again the whole period of 2008
[03:19:00.400 --> 03:19:04.080]  2009 when this color revolution in iran was being
[03:19:04.080 --> 03:19:08.960]  ginned up the part that the chances were low but now the chances are high
[03:19:08.960 --> 03:19:12.240]  and of course the iranians know this they're going to have their own
[03:19:12.240 --> 03:19:15.760]  counter-conference within a few days and they're going to have their own
[03:19:15.760 --> 03:19:19.200]  conference addressing some of these same issues trying to uh
[03:19:19.200 --> 03:19:23.760]  to put the onus on the u.s and indeed akhwin dinajad has now turned to ban
[03:19:23.760 --> 03:19:26.960]  ki moon of the united nations and demanded
[03:19:26.960 --> 03:19:31.360]  finally the independent impartial investigation of 9 11
[03:19:31.360 --> 03:19:35.840]  which is a very interesting initiative by akhwin dinajad

[03:19:58.880 --> 03:20:03.440]  flags where we've caught them originally we the people have entrusted
[03:20:03.440 --> 03:20:07.360]  government to be the guardians of currency to ensure purity content

[03:20:16.080 --> 03:20:20.080]  wisdom being lost with time the government we once entrusted to protect
[03:20:20.080 --> 03:20:23.760]  from counterfeit has colluded with private business creating the largest

[03:20:27.200 --> 03:20:31.120]  this is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable
[03:20:31.120 --> 03:20:34.400]  to our elected government but has also caused the dollar to lose more than
[03:20:34.400 --> 03:20:38.400]  90 cents of its original value now foreign governments are trying to divest

[03:25:51.040 --> 03:25:54.480]  world as governments discover tax revenue and discover
[03:25:54.480 --> 03:25:58.320]  that bond markets are unwilling to plug the gap
[03:25:58.320 --> 03:26:02.320]  the g7 states are already acquiring an unhealthy taste for the arbitrary

[03:27:11.040 --> 03:27:21.920]  important uh on a another extremely important note
[03:27:21.920 --> 03:27:26.480]  we have texas we have ohio we have michigan and many other states
[03:27:26.480 --> 03:27:30.480]  with county sheriffs and others saying
[03:27:30.480 --> 03:27:33.840]  we're laying off half or more of our police or sheriff's deputies
[03:27:33.840 --> 03:27:36.640]  we can't protect you the deputies we've got have been ordered to go out and
[03:27:36.640 --> 03:27:39.040]  raise revenue and write tickets this is on the news
[03:27:39.040 --> 03:27:43.120]  i've got three of the articles here and so it's up to you to protect yourself
[03:27:43.120 --> 03:27:46.000]  this is a monumental shift where they're admitting
[03:27:46.000 --> 03:27:49.280]  it's not their job and they can't protect you and they won't protect you
[03:27:49.280 --> 03:27:52.320]  and it's your job to be armed and defend yourself
[03:27:52.320 --> 03:27:58.240]  uh that of course is an article uh says sheriff arvin west
[03:27:58.240 --> 03:28:02.080]  county in texas tell citizens to arm themselves as he can no longer protect
[03:28:02.080 --> 03:28:05.760]  them from spillover border violence here's one from us today ohio
[03:28:05.760 --> 03:28:09.920]  official tells residents to arm themselves amid police cuts
[03:28:09.920 --> 03:28:14.960]  they cut the deputies from 112 to 49 deputies and there's so much bureaucracy
[03:28:14.960 --> 03:28:18.960]  there's only one patrol car per shift for the entire
[03:28:18.960 --> 03:28:23.840]  county of hundreds and hundreds of square miles
[03:28:23.840 --> 03:28:28.160]  now this is what oklahoma is doing they've always got good ideas there
[03:28:28.160 --> 03:28:31.040]  except for not letting you have burglar bars on your house and wanting to have
[03:28:31.040 --> 03:28:34.400]  licenses to have a home garden because you might grow pot
[03:28:34.400 --> 03:28:38.400]  guilty until proven innocent this is out of the associated press
[03:28:38.400 --> 03:28:43.520]  oklahoma tea parties and lawmakers envision militia
[03:28:43.520 --> 03:28:47.040]  well what do you think has always been the protection of the community
[03:28:47.040 --> 03:28:50.640]  what they demonize citizens protecting themselves and moved
[03:28:50.640 --> 03:28:54.560]  to a professional government body doing it and then it turned into a cesspit
[03:28:54.560 --> 03:28:57.040]  frustrated by recent political setbacks tea party leaders and some
[03:28:57.040 --> 03:28:59.440]  conservative members of the oklahoma legislature say they would like to
[03:28:59.440 --> 03:29:02.800]  create a new volunteer militia to help defend against what they believe
[03:29:02.800 --> 03:29:05.600]  are improper federal infringements on state sovereignty
[03:29:05.600 --> 03:29:10.800]  this is the way to do the militia the organized militia state level
[03:29:10.800 --> 03:29:14.400]  county by county under the sheriff you elect a patriot sheriff
[03:29:14.400 --> 03:29:18.400]  and then he picks good men and women of upstanding character who want to be
[03:29:18.400 --> 03:29:22.240]  volunteer and and you train with firearms you
[03:29:22.240 --> 03:29:26.560]  learn the constitution and this is very very uh exciting

[03:37:27.200 --> 03:37:31.520]  not bragging i'm saying this is showing the power of this radio show
[03:37:31.520 --> 03:37:36.000]  and listeners taking action and getting the word out
[03:37:37.280 --> 03:37:40.960]  here's another one provocateurs openly announced plans to stage tea party
[03:37:40.960 --> 03:37:44.080]  violence he wrote another story two days ago
[03:37:44.080 --> 03:37:47.680]  with their memos saying we're going to pose as races we're going to pose
[03:37:47.680 --> 03:37:52.320]  and act like idiots we're going to discredit them
[03:37:52.320 --> 03:37:56.080]  now here is the associated press today
[03:37:56.080 --> 03:38:00.080]  foes of tea party movement to infiltrate
[03:38:00.080 --> 03:38:04.400]  rallies and they list jason levin that we have specifically
[03:38:04.400 --> 03:38:09.920]  listed in the last week opponents of the fiscally conservative tea party
[03:38:09.920 --> 03:38:13.760]  movement say they plan to infiltrate and dismantle the political group
[03:38:13.760 --> 03:38:18.000]  by trying to make its members appear to be racist homophobic or moronic
[03:38:18.000 --> 03:38:23.040]  you see folks that is racketeering to go out for somebody's civil rights and
[03:38:23.040 --> 03:38:26.320]  their political right to protest for redress of grievance
[03:38:26.320 --> 03:38:29.840]  to go false flag them see everything's false flag
[03:38:29.840 --> 03:38:33.920]  i'm gonna get another false flag in a moment to stage things and it turned out
[03:38:33.920 --> 03:38:38.080]  the black caucus from every video angle went out and walked through the crowds
[03:38:38.080 --> 03:38:41.840]  no one spit no one yelled inward no one said we're going to kill you
[03:38:41.840 --> 03:38:46.080]  the media still says it happened the democratic party this is their policy
[03:38:46.080 --> 03:38:49.840]  obama sir gets to this that he gets up and says all shucks let's just get along
[03:38:49.840 --> 03:38:56.240]  then he demonizes talk radio so it continues jason levin creator of
[03:38:56.240 --> 03:38:59.920]  crash of tea party dot org said money the group has 65 leaders in major cities
[03:38:59.920 --> 03:39:02.960]  across the country who are trying to recruit members to infiltrate tea party
[03:39:02.960 --> 03:39:06.960]  events on april 15th tax filing day when the tea party groups across the
[03:39:06.960 --> 03:39:10.240]  country are planning to gather and protest high taxes
[03:39:10.240 --> 03:39:14.320]  and it turns out he owns a computer company that does work for the city so
[03:39:14.320 --> 03:39:17.840]  he gets city contracts and it turns out he's tied into the
[03:39:17.840 --> 03:39:21.680]  coffee party set up by obama a month ago to counter our
[03:39:21.680 --> 03:39:25.040]  announcement of the real coffee party to wake up the tea party
[03:39:25.040 --> 03:39:29.680]  i want to go to poll joseph watson now because this is very serious
[03:39:29.680 --> 03:39:33.600]  they're not just going to stop there they're going to demonize the tea party
[03:39:33.600 --> 03:39:37.040]  they're going to set up militias they're going to provocateur to demonize the
[03:39:37.040 --> 03:39:40.320]  idea of an armed citizenry to protect themselves
[03:39:40.320 --> 03:39:43.840]  and this is all part of the false flag operation but i wanted to get you on
[03:39:43.840 --> 03:39:46.640]  paul to commend you
[03:39:47.200 --> 03:39:53.680]  thanks like yeah well they've tried different tactics to
[03:39:53.680 --> 03:39:58.400]  hijack and infiltrate the tea party which of course to a larger extent has
[03:39:58.400 --> 03:40:02.800]  been already infiltrated by box news neocons that's right the
[03:40:02.800 --> 03:40:06.640]  left-right team up the right wing comes in starts tea party nation
[03:40:06.640 --> 03:40:10.000]  takes it over funds it but then there's a rebellion against that so they've got
[03:40:10.000 --> 03:40:13.280]  democrats with the coffee party and they've got the anarchist and others go
[03:40:13.280 --> 03:40:17.360]  ahead right so they first they tried with the
[03:40:17.360 --> 03:40:20.640]  coffee party which completely failed because the
[03:40:20.640 --> 03:40:25.040]  organizer hannabelle park was exposed as an obama operative
[03:40:25.040 --> 03:40:29.520]  bios had meetings in major cities at which three people showed up to these
[03:40:29.520 --> 03:40:33.200]  events in certain cities it was a complete failure
[03:40:33.200 --> 03:40:37.600]  so then they tried to stage these racist assaults like you said by having
[03:40:37.600 --> 03:40:40.800]  these congressmen and women walk straight through
[03:40:40.800 --> 03:40:45.680]  completely outside of protocol um protest groups in the hope that
[03:40:45.680 --> 03:40:49.680]  it would provoke some kind of incident it didn't which is why they had to
[03:40:49.680 --> 03:40:53.360]  completely manufacture the immanuel cleaver spitting
[03:40:53.360 --> 03:40:57.520]  incident that never happened that failed so now
[03:40:57.520 --> 03:41:02.000]  it appears that they're trying to re-energize the obama zombie youth
[03:41:02.000 --> 03:41:07.040]  which is a dwindling minority but energize them to carry out false flags
[03:41:07.040 --> 03:41:12.720]  through which the corporate media can then use to demonize the tea parties
[03:41:12.720 --> 03:41:17.440]  as you mentioned earlier it began about two weeks ago with this anarchist
[03:41:17.440 --> 03:41:21.520]  website called info shop which called on its members to
[03:41:21.520 --> 03:41:25.120]  crash the tea parties but not just to um
[03:41:25.120 --> 03:41:29.920]  go up against the neocons as you would think they mentioned directly by name
[03:41:29.920 --> 03:41:35.200]  alex jones conspiracy type ron paul supporters libertarians gun owners
[03:41:35.200 --> 03:41:38.560]  so they're going after everybody not just the neocons
[03:41:38.560 --> 03:41:42.800]  which mirrors the southern poverty law center fbi
[03:41:42.800 --> 03:41:45.760]  battle plan where they keep demonizing yours truly
[03:41:45.760 --> 03:41:49.280]  because they know that we're truly creating a constitutional populist
[03:41:49.280 --> 03:41:53.920]  movement and to digress for a moment think of the true racism and the race
[03:41:53.920 --> 03:41:57.280]  baiting and the balkanization and the division
[03:41:57.280 --> 03:41:59.680]  that when we say we don't want government health care
[03:41:59.680 --> 03:42:03.840]  we don't want new wars racist uh we don't like the banker bailout
[03:42:03.840 --> 03:42:10.960]  racist they are 24 seven invoking racial division they are obviously a bunch of
[03:42:10.960 --> 03:42:14.320]  poverty pimps this is how chicago and new york control people in
[03:42:14.320 --> 03:42:18.960]  different racial groups i mean this is so criminal and so
[03:42:18.960 --> 03:42:22.640]  openly wicked and because we're not racist
[03:42:22.640 --> 03:42:26.480]  they've got to go in and now provoke a turret and this is a big blow to them
[03:42:26.480 --> 03:42:32.000]  that this is an ap well the fact is if as they claim
[03:42:32.000 --> 03:42:35.840]  and as chris mathews and kurt watson and all these other
[03:42:35.840 --> 03:42:39.840]  corporate images claim that the tea parties full of
[03:42:39.840 --> 03:42:45.840]  you know quote racist homophobic moron and why do they have to infiltrate it
[03:42:45.840 --> 03:42:50.560]  and carry out these false flags to characterize the tea party as being
[03:42:50.560 --> 03:42:54.880]  full of racist homophobes and moron if it already was then they wouldn't
[03:42:54.880 --> 03:42:58.480]  need to do it in the first place would they but this is all
[03:42:58.480 --> 03:43:02.080]  designed to serve up exactly the kind of propaganda that the
[03:43:02.080 --> 03:43:08.000]  establishment media is begging for to fulfill its characterization of anyone
[03:43:08.000 --> 03:43:11.280]  who expresses any kind of dissent against big government
[03:43:11.280 --> 03:43:15.120]  as a dangerous extremist and what's ironic
[03:43:15.120 --> 03:43:19.280]  as you mentioned earlier what's rich is the fact that these so-called anarchists
[03:43:19.280 --> 03:43:22.880]  are nothing of the kind they're calling for
[03:43:22.880 --> 03:43:26.800]  you know opposition to the tea party is because they pose a threat to their
[03:43:26.800 --> 03:43:30.720]  government welfare welfare when anarchism is supposed to be
[03:43:30.720 --> 03:43:33.840]  about limited or no government whatsoever
[03:43:33.840 --> 03:43:40.240]  they talk about opposing gun owners you know they're supposed to oppose power
[03:43:40.240 --> 03:43:43.120]  and monopolies of the state they're anarchists right
[03:43:43.120 --> 03:43:46.880]  and yet they think that only agents of the state should have firearms and
[03:43:46.880 --> 03:43:50.320]  everybody else should be disarmed so they're not anarchists
[03:43:50.320 --> 03:43:53.680]  they're socialist punks at the best and at the worst
[03:43:53.680 --> 03:43:58.640]  they're statist dogs and the establishment loves these kind of
[03:43:58.640 --> 03:44:02.080]  people because as we've proven in the past and as your
[03:44:02.080 --> 03:44:07.040]  police state movies the early ones prove they've been infiltrated by
[03:44:07.040 --> 03:44:10.560]  provocateurs that nearly every major global summit
[03:44:10.560 --> 03:44:14.720]  to cause mayhem and violence which is then exploited
[03:44:14.720 --> 03:44:18.480]  to demonize peaceful demonstrators and that's exactly what they're planning
[03:44:18.480 --> 03:44:21.600]  again with these false flags
[03:44:22.160 --> 03:44:26.320]  well you're right paul but again we've been proven right in spades
[03:44:26.320 --> 03:44:33.440]  once again that the black congressional caucus staged
[03:44:33.440 --> 03:44:38.080]  uh the union thugs beating people up and then blaming it on patriots
[03:44:38.080 --> 03:44:44.320]  staged all of this is staged and i have seen the
[03:44:44.320 --> 03:44:47.120]  anarchists come with the cops leave with the cops
[03:44:47.120 --> 03:44:49.600]  the anarchists have been caught all over the world
[03:44:49.600 --> 03:44:53.360]  flown in by the governments by the ford foundation
[03:44:53.360 --> 03:44:56.160]  i've seen them handing out communist leaflets and then saying they're
[03:44:56.160 --> 03:45:00.720]  anarchist this is such a sick joke you got dirty
[03:45:00.720 --> 03:45:06.320]  filthy communist scum who all get government payments
[03:45:06.320 --> 03:45:12.320]  and socialist collectivist trash running around
[03:45:12.320 --> 03:45:16.000]  saying that they're anarchist or libertarians that's another form
[03:45:16.000 --> 03:45:19.200]  of false flag against real anarchists blaming them
[03:45:19.200 --> 03:45:22.320]  for what this scum does
[03:45:22.800 --> 03:45:26.640]  yeah the rhetoric they're spewing about tea parties
[03:45:26.640 --> 03:45:31.520]  echoes precisely the same thing being put out by the corporate media you know
[03:45:31.520 --> 03:45:34.800]  the corporate media that anarchists are supposed to despise
[03:45:34.800 --> 03:45:38.720]  because it represents the propaganda organ of the state
[03:45:38.720 --> 03:45:42.640]  and that is that most tea parties are racist extremists
[03:45:42.640 --> 03:45:46.720]  let me expand on that when the national poll last week that you covered
[03:45:46.720 --> 03:45:50.320]  uh said that 40 percent are independents or democrats
[03:45:50.320 --> 03:45:53.760]  in the tea party and that's what scares the system that's why they sent sarah
[03:45:53.760 --> 03:45:57.120]  palin in she said the republican party must take this over
[03:45:57.120 --> 03:45:59.920]  because they don't want a true anti-encompassing that'll get people
[03:45:59.920 --> 03:46:03.760]  like rand paul in against neocon republicans now
[03:46:03.760 --> 03:46:08.560]  uh getting into another uh facet of all of this
[03:46:08.560 --> 03:46:12.240]  uh other areas of false flag terror
[03:46:12.240 --> 03:46:15.680]  this can really blow up in their face if people know what to look for
[03:46:15.680 --> 03:46:20.240]  and videotape it and catch them well yeah which is why
[03:46:20.240 --> 03:46:24.800]  people need to not be provoked by these individuals and just need to use
[03:46:24.800 --> 03:46:29.360]  video cameras as their weapon with which to expose their behavior
[03:46:29.360 --> 03:46:34.640]  but the uh the real test of how it plays out will come down to if the
[03:46:34.640 --> 03:46:40.000]  mainstream media takes the bait um you know if there's any kind of
[03:46:40.000 --> 03:46:44.240]  racist or violent incident of these tea parties on thursday
[03:46:44.240 --> 03:46:48.480]  then the headline in the corporate media is going to be something like
[03:46:48.480 --> 03:46:52.160]  you know n word yelled at tea party rally
[03:46:52.160 --> 03:46:56.880]  and only deep down within those news reports and those articles will they
[03:46:56.880 --> 03:47:00.000]  have something like you know tea party organizers claim the
[03:47:00.000 --> 03:47:03.520]  spoilers were made by anarchists because they'll claim that they're being
[03:47:03.520 --> 03:47:07.120]  neutral about the whole issue but exactly you've got to be on site
[03:47:07.120 --> 03:47:10.720]  with the ap article for these ignorant reporters some of them
[03:47:10.720 --> 03:47:14.080]  will go over you'll see if it stays you'll see them set up
[03:47:14.080 --> 03:47:16.960]  in front and they'll bring the anarchists over you'll see an obama
[03:47:16.960 --> 03:47:20.640]  director you know local commie come on in we're going to get their money we're
[03:47:20.640 --> 03:47:23.840]  taking the country over it's a revolution get right here now scream in
[03:47:23.840 --> 03:47:26.880]  word and and and and and and you can catch them
[03:47:26.880 --> 03:47:31.360]  right there this can be a devastating blow against this scum
[03:47:31.360 --> 03:47:36.080]  yeah and in the past there's a famous for example cnn video of the cnn
[03:47:36.080 --> 03:47:39.840]  reporter and uh the tea party activists
[03:47:39.840 --> 03:47:43.600]  film the whole scenario and from the very beginning she's looking for people
[03:47:43.600 --> 03:47:46.800]  with signs that could be um characterized as
[03:47:46.800 --> 03:47:50.960]  extremist she's looking for you know people who can't string two sentences
[03:47:50.960 --> 03:47:55.120]  together so the corporate media are going to be out there in spades looking
[03:47:55.120 --> 03:47:58.560]  for these kind of people and if they're on hand to provide these
[03:47:58.560 --> 03:48:03.040]  false flags then you can bet that many areas of the corporate media are going
[03:48:03.040 --> 03:48:06.800]  to lack it up but the fact that this has got our way ahead of time
[03:48:06.800 --> 03:48:10.160]  and it's gone viral on the internet that this is what they're planning
[03:48:10.160 --> 03:48:13.840]  has kind of ruined it well paul don't you remember there was another
[03:48:13.840 --> 03:48:18.000]  article i think nemo wrote over a month ago and i did an emergency alert on the
[03:48:18.000 --> 03:48:21.520]  radio and i said get this out to all the tea parties
[03:48:21.520 --> 03:48:25.360]  we've got to force this into mainstream media i i just want to point out again
[03:48:25.360 --> 03:48:28.560]  the credit doesn't even go to info wars dot com or present planet dot com
[03:48:28.560 --> 03:48:31.360]  it goes to our listeners who listened to what i said
[03:48:31.360 --> 03:48:34.720]  got the article where you had all the proof and nemo had all the proof
[03:48:34.720 --> 03:48:38.560]  and and they got these out to people and now this is going to be another big
[03:48:38.560 --> 03:48:42.560]  blow against these provocateurs another issue
[03:48:42.560 --> 03:48:47.280]  i support the militia it is constitutional i've warned militias that
[03:48:47.280 --> 03:48:50.960]  people try to infiltrate them and set them up and that fake militias have
[03:48:50.960 --> 03:48:54.400]  been created and this has come out in the news over the last 20 years
[03:48:54.400 --> 03:48:59.760]  15 16 years or so to then demonize the idea of militia overall
[03:48:59.760 --> 03:49:04.240]  then i saw a few militias demonize me with a false flag
[03:49:04.240 --> 03:49:08.000]  straw man claiming that i was saying all militias were bad
[03:49:08.000 --> 03:49:12.160]  when all i was saying is you're being infiltrated and provocateur
[03:49:12.160 --> 03:49:16.160]  just like the tea parties that then identifies feds as well
[03:49:16.160 --> 03:49:20.480]  so again we're learning how to identify the operatives here paul
[03:49:20.480 --> 03:49:24.960]  exactly and one of the key red flags is the fact that they uh
[03:49:24.960 --> 03:49:28.640]  not only call for violence but they directly threaten people by name
[03:49:28.640 --> 03:49:32.080]  which is exactly what howl turner was doing and he was exposed
[03:49:32.080 --> 03:49:36.560]  as an FBI provocateur paid by the federal government to make violent
[03:49:36.560 --> 03:49:39.520]  statements which is exactly what the accusers are doing
[03:49:39.520 --> 03:49:42.720]  when they're the main ones funding it and they're behind it
[03:49:42.720 --> 03:49:46.560]  paul do you think they're getting ready to frame us with news articles every
[03:49:46.560 --> 03:49:49.520]  day sometimes multiple times saying we're calling for violence
[03:49:49.520 --> 03:49:53.120]  because we know that that they're actually setting it up and they're angry
[03:49:53.120 --> 03:49:57.040]  at us or is it just a demonization tactic

[03:55:02.400 --> 03:55:06.400]  running away from them and not answering the fact the glaciers are getting bigger

[03:55:22.880 --> 03:55:29.600]  of al gore watson we've got so many u.n u.s and and globalist documents
[03:55:29.600 --> 03:55:33.680]  admitting world government through the environmental movement paul
[03:55:33.680 --> 03:55:36.800]  yeah and this is official white house policy it was
[03:55:36.800 --> 03:55:41.520]  it was leaked to the guardian after it was discovered on a computer left in a
[03:55:41.520 --> 03:55:44.880]  european hotel room and it's basically a white house
[03:55:44.880 --> 03:55:49.120]  directive that says that their number one goal is to quote reinforce the
[03:55:49.120 --> 03:55:53.440]  perception that the u.s is constructively engaged in u.n negotiation
[03:55:53.440 --> 03:55:59.520]  in an effort to produce a global regime to combat climate change so anyone who
[03:55:59.520 --> 03:56:04.000]  thought there was a fissure between the u.s government and the united nation
[03:56:04.000 --> 03:56:08.720]  that's being completely proven redundant our bomber administration is fully
[03:56:08.720 --> 03:56:12.240]  behind the push for a global government in the name of
[03:56:12.240 --> 03:56:15.760]  saving the earth and of course it's now come out that
[03:56:15.760 --> 03:56:23.760]  the british lawyer who called for um ecocide laws to be introduced whereby
[03:56:23.760 --> 03:56:29.120]  if you express skepticism towards man-made climate change then you're
[03:56:29.120 --> 03:56:33.520]  committing a crime against humanity and you're liable to be tried
[03:56:33.520 --> 03:56:37.840]  in the international criminal court it's turned out that
[03:56:37.840 --> 03:56:42.000]  basically she's on the board of an organization that was created directly
[03:56:42.000 --> 03:56:46.160]  and is funded by the club of Rome which of course is the
[03:56:46.160 --> 03:56:50.800]  organization founded by david rockefeller in 1968
[03:56:50.800 --> 03:56:54.720]  which tasked itself with manufacturing
[03:56:54.720 --> 03:56:58.320]  a scare surrounding the environment and global warming
[03:56:58.320 --> 03:57:02.960]  in an effort to manipulate the public into supporting global government
