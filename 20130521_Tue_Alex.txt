[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:39.840]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:39.840 --> 00:43.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, thank you so much for joining us. There's been the tragic
[00:43.900 --> 00:50.440]  tornadoes that hit yesterday afternoon, yesterday evening, in a suburb of Oklahoma City, just
[00:50.440 --> 00:52.800]  north of where I sit in Austin, Texas.
[00:52.800 --> 00:58.880]  Austin is about where Tornado Alley ends. There are still tornadoes south of here, but
[00:58.880 --> 01:04.680]  the real decimation center, I don't know, 30-something people died a while back just
[01:04.680 --> 01:10.680]  north of Austin when a big tornado came through the suburb of Gerald. And I grew up in Dallas
[01:10.680 --> 01:16.160]  on Lake Ray Hubbard. Almost every year, we would see tornadoes, cuz you could see from
[01:16.160 --> 01:19.880]  the hill where we lived over the lake, 20 miles or more.
[01:19.880 --> 01:26.320]  You could see the city off 30 miles away, so I guess about 30 miles. Sometimes you would
[01:26.320 --> 01:33.640]  see when the spring storms were right, four or five tornadoes, one, three miles away,
[01:33.640 --> 01:40.640]  schooning across the cow pastures and things, and then going out and hitting the lake, and
[01:40.640 --> 01:46.600]  going from gray with debris and dirt, and then turning blue-gray, and becoming a water
[01:46.600 --> 01:47.600]  spout.
[01:47.600 --> 01:52.760]  In fact, I've seen three tornadoes at once in the lake, beautiful in a horrific way,
[01:52.760 --> 01:57.600]  and then I'm off the distance tornadoes. So I've had a lot of experience with tornadoes.
[01:57.600 --> 02:03.120]  And growing up, I even had family that had tornado shelters, but you'd end up using it
[02:03.120 --> 02:07.480]  to basically store stuff in it as a storage shed.
[02:07.480 --> 02:13.480]  Of course, my aunt and uncle had a tornado shelter when I lived out in Atlanta. And I've
[02:13.480 --> 02:19.560]  told people, you should have a tornado shelter if you live in Tornado Alley. This year, they
[02:19.560 --> 02:24.720]  reported about a month ago, was the least amount of tornadoes so far for any spring they'd
[02:24.720 --> 02:26.800]  seen in decades.
[02:26.800 --> 02:31.400]  Every time there is a tornado, Al Gore and others say, hey, we need to have global carbon
[02:31.400 --> 02:38.320]  taxes because you're causing tornadoes. Tornadoes have always happened in many parts of the
[02:38.320 --> 02:45.320]  world, where you have hot and cold air coming together, Africa, North America, Europe.
[02:45.320 --> 02:51.000]  I mean, the whole planet has had different types of storms. Kublai Khan and his fleet
[02:51.000 --> 02:57.080]  was wiped out with the divine wind, the kamikaze. I think it was Kublai Khan, we can look that
[02:57.080 --> 03:04.200]  up. Several Chinese invasion fleets before the combustion engine was invented, hundreds
[03:04.200 --> 03:11.000]  of years before, were destroyed by typhoons or Pacific hurricanes.
[03:11.000 --> 03:14.660]  In the Atlantic, they're hurricanes, Pacific, they're typhoons. Typhoons can get up going
[03:14.660 --> 03:19.800]  faster cuz there's more hot water, bigger ocean. They debate the numbers, and I hope
[03:19.800 --> 03:28.440]  the lower numbers are accurate. Some numbers are 21 dead, hundreds wounded. A school was
[03:28.440 --> 03:30.520]  hit, as you know, a bunch of dead children.
[03:30.520 --> 03:35.600]  And that no waiting period, no five-day waiting period will protect us from these tornadoes,
[03:35.600 --> 03:39.640]  just like Sandy Hook. The only thing that will protect you is preparation like a storm
[03:39.640 --> 03:43.600]  shelter like all public schools used to have. Now they build them the last 30 years without
[03:43.600 --> 03:50.120]  them, because I guess it's extreme to have a storm shelter.
[03:50.120 --> 03:58.500]  Only kooks do that. But they are still trying to say conservatives and libertarians and
[03:58.500 --> 04:02.340]  people that don't wanna have a global carbon tax paid to Warren Buffett and David Rockefeller
[04:02.340 --> 04:09.960]  and Lord Rothschild, it's our fault. Democratic Senator Whitehouse has said that it's the
[04:09.960 --> 04:15.080]  GOP's fault for the tornado.
[04:15.080 --> 04:21.080]  And we also have the creator of The Daily Show putting on a tweet saying that God targeted
[04:21.080 --> 04:25.240]  conservatives. I mean, these people will make it political. By the way, I was listening
[04:25.240 --> 04:33.840]  in the radio this morning to 590, and I heard part of Obama's speech. And I'm trying to
[04:33.840 --> 04:37.920]  find the transcript, I can't find it, where he talked about, we've got Homeland Security,
[04:37.920 --> 04:43.500]  Janet Napolitano on the job with the anti-terror forces helping. And I can't find that in the
[04:43.500 --> 04:48.700]  news where they're equating it to Oklahoma City and the tragedy that Oklahoma City went
[04:48.700 --> 04:49.700]  through.
[04:49.700 --> 04:53.520]  But I heard them over and over again this morning say that. So I've got Watson ferreting
[04:53.520 --> 05:01.680]  about looking for that info. So we'll break it all down straight ahead.
[05:01.680 --> 05:05.920]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the terrible danger we're in.
[05:05.920 --> 05:10.320]  Alex Jones has warned you for years to get a good food storage. We thought the danger
[05:10.320 --> 05:15.720]  was drought, or food delivered to our gas tanks, or our food sold to other countries,
[05:15.720 --> 05:20.620]  or food so expensive that only those on food stamps and welfare could afford it. But we
[05:20.620 --> 05:25.480]  have just experienced the most effective way to lose your freedom, liberty and security
[05:25.480 --> 05:32.440]  without even a fight. Government regulation. After a 160-year tradition of self-reliance,
[05:32.440 --> 05:36.880]  the do-it-yourself and charitable Mormon food storage canneries in half the country are
[05:36.880 --> 05:43.560]  forced to shut down due to excessive government regulations. Grow your own food, more regulations.
[05:43.560 --> 05:49.960]  If you've ever been warned to get food while you can, this is it. Call 800-409-5633 or
[05:49.960 --> 05:57.800]  on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex. That's 800-409-5633 or on the web efoodsdirect.com
[05:57.800 --> 06:04.320]  slash Alex. I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was
[06:04.320 --> 06:09.320]  lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for
[06:09.320 --> 06:14.680]  minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I immediately
[06:14.680 --> 06:19.880]  could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now there are hundreds of
[06:19.880 --> 06:24.640]  great products at infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped
[06:24.640 --> 06:33.640]  me lose 37 pounds in just two months. Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst
[06:33.640 --> 06:38.120]  and Rebound. When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I

[08:00.800 --> 08:18.240]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[08:18.240 --> 08:24.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this 21st day of May 2013. We're gonna
[08:24.720 --> 08:29.940]  be live here for the next three hours, Lord willing. There are a lot of storms here in
[08:29.940 --> 08:37.200]  Central Texas and looks like we could have some tornadoes, but God forbid anybody have
[08:37.200 --> 08:42.080]  a storm cellar or a storm shelter in their backyard.
[08:42.080 --> 08:49.640]  Because while that's passÃ©, only kooks do that. Up until the 1950s, you can look this
[08:49.640 --> 08:56.160]  up all over Tornado Alley, from Southern Illinois all the way down to Central Texas. Tornado
[08:56.160 --> 09:02.000]  Alley officially ends down by about New Braunville, Texas, south of Austin.
[09:02.000 --> 09:08.000]  And growing up, I mean, I grew up in Dallas where almost every year people were killed
[09:08.000 --> 09:16.080]  by tornadoes. And I got to watch tornadoes, no exaggeration, probably 50 times in my life.
[09:16.080 --> 09:22.880]  I'd been in Austin and on the highway and saw a giant tornado. I'd been blown off the
[09:22.880 --> 09:29.800]  road, almost killed with my father, outside Fredericksburg, Texas, coming into Stonewall,
[09:29.800 --> 09:35.000]  slowed down about 40 miles an hour, was gonna pull over.
[09:35.000 --> 09:38.080]  And the tornado blew us off the road, and it was the state police that drug us out of
[09:38.080 --> 09:42.800]  the vehicle, the smash vehicle, that said, you're lucky you survived. And the tornado
[09:42.800 --> 09:50.080]  had torn up Stonewall and torn down power lines and overturned cars into Johnson City.
[09:50.080 --> 09:54.080]  In fact, I was sitting here about to talk about tornadoes, and just remembered I was
[09:54.080 --> 09:59.480]  almost killed by a tornado. Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people are killed a year by
[09:59.480 --> 10:00.480]  tornadoes.
[10:00.480 --> 10:08.720]  They've always been killed by the hundreds every year. My dad saw a tornado go across
[10:08.720 --> 10:13.160]  the street from his farmhouse and tear up his cousin's house when he was a kid. Just
[10:13.160 --> 10:19.880]  tear the whole house up like something out of The Wizard of Oz. Just grab oak trees like
[10:19.880 --> 10:27.520]  matchsticks and just throw them.
[10:27.520 --> 10:34.460]  And what is the government's answer? Call out the army, have Obama grandstand, and promise
[10:34.460 --> 10:42.840]  a bunch of federal aid instead of having storm shelters at all of the schools. But you're
[10:42.840 --> 10:45.880]  not gonna have zoning rules on that.
[10:45.880 --> 10:51.840]  You did until the 1950s, cuz that's an actual threat. More people die every year, you can
[10:51.840 --> 10:58.600]  pull these numbers up, from deer killing, it's over 250 on average. Hundreds die from
[10:58.600 --> 11:04.520]  honeybees, hundreds from wasps individually, each group. You can look these up, there's
[11:04.520 --> 11:07.820]  been news articles about it.
[11:07.820 --> 11:13.620]  And if you look at how many people die in mass shootings, about half of it's gang related,
[11:13.620 --> 11:20.200]  it's 87 in 2012. And less than half of those were actually innocent people being killed
[11:20.200 --> 11:28.660]  and not gang war stuff. But the LA Times had the headline just two weeks ago of, as gun
[11:28.660 --> 11:33.960]  crime plummets, people think gun crime is up.
[11:33.960 --> 11:44.320]  And Forbes last week had the headline of, disarming facts, more guns, less crime. More
[11:44.320 --> 11:57.400]  guns, less crime, that's a fact. But again, there is the perception that there is a epidemic
[11:57.400 --> 12:03.640]  of gun violence in this country. And the truth is there's only an epidemic in areas where
[12:03.640 --> 12:05.480]  they've disarmed the general public.
[12:05.480 --> 12:11.560]  So criminals flock there, cuz there's also always a welfare state, where the victims
[12:11.560 --> 12:17.320]  have been disarmed, because it's government by and for criminals. And that's why we're
[12:17.320 --> 12:22.600]  so blessed to be on the radio on stations like 1530 in Chicago, which is a great old
[12:22.600 --> 12:27.720]  city, great museums, great people, great sports teams. I like Chicagoans, I got family that
[12:27.720 --> 12:34.520]  lives up there, my cousin Buckley lives up there, Buckley Hammond.
[12:34.520 --> 12:40.240]  But it is a mafia-run city, and things are only going to get worse. More cops won't save
[12:40.240 --> 12:45.840]  you, army checkpoints won't save you. Only liberty and arming the people will run the
[12:45.840 --> 12:54.280]  criminals out of your city. Just like Chicago has the highest crime rate in the world, the
[12:54.280 --> 12:59.920]  country with the highest crime rate per capita is Mexico.
[12:59.920 --> 13:07.080]  Good old Mexico, a beautiful country, a really amazing culture in many respects, but also
[13:07.080 --> 13:15.400]  a culture of El Jefes, the chief, the big ones, dominating people forever. Since the
[13:15.400 --> 13:26.960]  time of the Aztecs passing the baton to Cortez. And there's a 69% drop in wounding shootings,
[13:26.960 --> 13:34.000]  39% in overall shootings since 1992, Justice Department's new numbers, and a 49% drop in
[13:34.000 --> 13:35.000]  violent crime.
[13:35.000 --> 13:41.600]  People say, well, how do you trust those government statistics? Well, I don't trust the labor
[13:41.600 --> 13:45.640]  statistics. They've been proven to be frauds by top economists. I know how they're frauds.
[13:45.640 --> 13:52.080]  I know what the real numbers are. See, I've studied the gun statistics. The crime statistics
[13:52.080 --> 13:58.980]  are the global model, US crime statistics, shut up by J. Edgar Hoover back in the 30s.
[13:58.980 --> 14:05.200]  Because they're compiled locally and publicly posted and then checked by statisticians and
[14:05.200 --> 14:07.760]  demographers at major universities.
[14:07.760 --> 14:11.520]  And they are the most cross reference check numbers. And they're not perfect cuz some
[14:11.520 --> 14:16.200]  crimes unreported and some things like that go on. But they're the best statistics in
[14:16.200 --> 14:24.240]  the world. The model, look it up, are FBI crime statistics. Gotta give credit where
[14:24.240 --> 14:29.640]  credit's due to J. Edgar Hoover when he wasn't dressed up in a flower skirt.
[14:29.640 --> 14:36.900]  He was, that's what he was, was a librarian basically, a statistician. And Mexico has
[14:36.900 --> 14:42.800]  the highest crime rate in the world. It's over 60,000 dead now in the last six years.
[14:42.800 --> 14:46.360]  And of course, they're always finding mass graves, so it's probably a lot higher. The
[14:46.360 --> 14:54.880]  disappearances are over 50,000 on top of that, so it's probably more than 110,000.
[14:54.880 --> 15:00.320]  And once the lawlessness happens, rape whoever you want, rob whoever you want, shoot whoever
[15:00.320 --> 15:07.200]  you want. Because the police are corrupt on the payroll or they're scared, and there's
[15:07.200 --> 15:12.040]  no justice. The only places now with lowering crime rates, and this even came out a few
[15:12.040 --> 15:16.760]  months ago on the Christian Science Monitor and a few other places, was where vigilantes
[15:16.760 --> 15:21.640]  with guns they got in the US, that's why they're not full auto or hand grenades or tanks like
[15:21.640 --> 15:23.440]  the government and the cartels.
[15:23.440 --> 15:27.600]  Citizens have said, well, you might as well fight back, we're already being fed on. And
[15:27.600 --> 15:34.520]  all over Central and Northern Mexico, they're following the Chiapas model, but it's not
[15:34.520 --> 15:39.960]  communist. And they're following the example of Mormons that are down there, Mormon Mexicans,
[15:39.960 --> 15:45.000]  and they're fighting back. And guess what the cartels do? Guess what the kidnappers
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.480]  do? Guess what the criminal police do?
[15:47.480 --> 15:52.660]  They back down. Hey, you shoot my son for no reason, I'm going to find you and I'm going
[15:52.660 --> 15:59.680]  to blow your head off, is what the Mexican Mormons have done, leading the way for liberty
[15:59.680 --> 16:04.340]  down there in Mexico. And I'm not Mormon, I'm giving credit where it's due. Vice, that's
[16:04.340 --> 16:08.080]  pretty much an anti-gun news site, but they do some good work. They've had to admit that
[16:08.080 --> 16:09.080]  as well.
[16:09.080 --> 16:16.480]  Yeah, Mexican vigilantes seize town, arrest police, Huffington Post, they're done playing
[16:16.480 --> 16:22.340]  games. And that's who the Mexican government wants to stop from getting guns. But those
[16:22.340 --> 16:28.320]  people have nothing to lose because they get shaken down by the police and the drug cartels,
[16:28.320 --> 16:29.320]  the poorest people.
[16:29.320 --> 16:37.320]  I've been in Mexico just about four years ago visiting pyramids that I wanted to see.
[16:37.320 --> 16:43.360]  And I pull up, I was told it was a safe area in Yucatan, been there probably 15 times in
[16:43.360 --> 16:49.120]  my life. I wanted to go see some pyramids, we're on a nice bus that left officially from
[16:49.120 --> 16:55.020]  the tourist destination. And the military with machine guns walk out, aim their guns
[16:55.020 --> 16:58.520]  at the bus drivers as an act of domination like Boston.
[16:58.520 --> 17:03.020]  They get the guy out, he pleads with them. He opens their wallet, they take every bit
[17:03.020 --> 17:08.320]  of money of tips he'd gotten that day from a couple other trips. This was in the afternoon
[17:08.320 --> 17:15.480]  from different three hour tours. And the guy got on the bus with tears in his eyes. I'm
[17:15.480 --> 17:21.040]  not going to live like that and you don't wanna live like that either.
[17:21.040 --> 17:35.940]  And that's where America is going to go, ladies and gentlemen. Where Mexican troops in a jeep.
[17:35.940 --> 17:41.740]  By the way, I've been in Mexico when my dad rented a Volkswagen with my mom, even before
[17:41.740 --> 17:48.280]  my sister was around. I'm 14 years older than my sister. And the Mexican police pulled them
[17:48.280 --> 17:52.240]  over and said, I want a tip.
[17:52.240 --> 17:59.160]  My dad said, who can speak broken Spanish? Well, was I speeding? No, pay me if you don't
[17:59.160 --> 18:07.480]  want trouble, gringo. I'll never forget the guy smiling, that smile of tyranny, that satisfaction
[18:07.480 --> 18:12.200]  that I now see in more and more bureaucrats eyes here, that I see in North Korean video.
[18:12.200 --> 18:18.080]  That I see in Nazi Germany film reels and Soviet film reels, the same look, the arrogant
[18:18.080 --> 18:24.120]  power trip, the swagger, the enjoyment that I saw on some of the Boston police face threatening
[18:24.120 --> 18:25.980]  reporters and bugging their eyes out.
[18:25.980 --> 18:32.760]  And the guy had all these gold teeth. And he just looked at my dad, pay me if you don't
[18:32.760 --> 18:41.400]  want trouble. And my dad said, how much? And he said, how much do you have? How much do
[18:41.400 --> 18:46.500]  you have? And people ask, how far will the tyranny go? That's what Thomas Jefferson said,
[18:46.500 --> 18:53.200]  the tyranny will go as far as you let it go.
[18:53.200 --> 18:58.960]  Until you say, I've got guns, I'm not looking for trouble, but you assault me or try to,
[18:58.960 --> 19:04.880]  I'm gonna fight back, which is an inalienable human God given base right. I don't care what
[19:04.880 --> 19:11.840]  stinking government people say in their fancy outfits. America, just like North Korea, just
[19:11.840 --> 19:18.040]  like Mexico, just like Nigeria, just like corrupt Eastern Europe, our police now dress.
[19:18.040 --> 19:23.600]  You know, for 70 years, they've had the foxes in Mexico. They were fans of the German government
[19:23.600 --> 19:29.200]  then who got German Kurtzel helmets. You go to Latin America, that's all, they've always
[19:29.200 --> 19:35.320]  liked Kurtzel helmets, the German Kurtzel helmet of World War I. Pull up the Mexican
[19:35.320 --> 19:42.880]  foxes for 70 years, really more since the 30s, it's longer, almost 80 years. They wear
[19:42.880 --> 19:48.600]  black uniforms with black mask with Kurtzel helmets, Kurtzel helmets.
[19:48.600 --> 19:55.360]  And that's how our police now dress with Kurtzel helmets. Being a fascist is very sexy. And
[19:55.360 --> 20:02.120]  as you notice, this blight grows, America and prosperity dies.

[24:27.580 --> 24:47.500]  You know coming up I'm gonna open the phones up to get your take on just how despicable
[24:47.500 --> 24:54.920]  it is that the Daily Show creator came out in a tweet and said tornado clearly targets
[24:54.920 --> 25:03.400]  conservatives it's a total voodoo these people and democratic senator uses Oklahoma tornado
[25:03.400 --> 25:11.520]  for anti GOP rant and again we'll pull this article up record low amount of tornadoes
[25:11.520 --> 25:17.880]  in 2013 so far in the spring season like I just saw that number like two weeks ago so
[25:17.880 --> 25:23.800]  we're gonna be breaking that down in the next segment I want to hear from Oklahomans specifically
[25:23.800 --> 25:29.360]  if you're in Oklahoma City or the suburb that was hit or there's reportedly first they were
[25:29.360 --> 25:37.440]  saying 100 dead and 51 dead now 21 dead we don't know the real numbers but I hope it
[25:37.440 --> 25:44.240]  is the low ones including up to 20 children in one facility in a school so we'll look
[25:44.240 --> 25:47.440]  at all that yeah there was the headline the guys actually found it put it up on the TV
[25:47.440 --> 25:57.200]  screen USA Today tornado activity hits 60 year low the USA in the past 12 months has
[25:57.200 --> 26:04.360]  seen the fewest number of tornadoes since 1954 and the death toll from the dangerous
[26:04.360 --> 26:10.720]  storms have dropped dramatically since 2011 you know and that's a big deal to say there's
[26:10.720 --> 26:15.560]  less tornadoes because now they have Doppler radar all over the country and they know and
[26:15.560 --> 26:20.440]  back in the 50s they had to have spotters that marked them and then put it you know
[26:20.440 --> 26:26.360]  into the files of the meteorological service show a lot of the growth of tornadoes that
[26:26.360 --> 26:30.680]  Al Gore has been talking about was just that there's more people and the science you know
[26:30.680 --> 26:35.800]  it knows if a tornado forms for 20 seconds they've now got Doppler and and it becomes
[26:35.800 --> 26:42.440]  a record on the computer system so even with all that tornado activity is way down which
[26:42.440 --> 26:47.400]  I actually there's all sorts of cycles but I think that's creepy that we've got record
[26:47.400 --> 26:52.020]  low tornado activity there's a reason people built tornado shelters all over the country
[26:52.020 --> 26:56.440]  because a lot of people got killed and you survive a tornado believe me you go out you
[26:56.440 --> 27:00.720]  build a shelter next time and a lot of people did get to shelters outside Oklahoma City
[27:00.720 --> 27:04.940]  but they had wooden roofs metal roofs that just got torn right off and they got sucked
[27:04.940 --> 27:12.040]  right out you need a concrete roof and I've had Joel Skousen expert on shelters on and
[27:12.040 --> 27:19.400]  I've had others on and I got criticized last year and this year when I even put out free
[27:19.400 --> 27:24.900]  plans on the website like you fear monger we don't need a tornado shelter well you haven't
[27:24.900 --> 27:31.840]  been almost killed by one like I have I mean I'll be honest if it looks really stormy in
[27:31.840 --> 27:36.600]  the spring and I see green sky and weird clouds going together and looks like rotation I'll
[27:36.600 --> 27:42.040]  get out my iPhone computer now and I'll check and see if there's any you know tornado warnings
[27:42.040 --> 27:46.080]  and if there are folks I go find a bridge and I pull up and read a book or something
[27:46.080 --> 27:52.480]  because let me tell you my uncle I'm sitting at his house we lived in Fredericksburg then
[27:52.480 --> 27:56.240]  up on this beautiful Vista Hill and my grandmother's out there we just had lunch we're gonna go
[27:56.240 --> 28:01.920]  shooting all day target practicing and he looked at me and he said you guys better not
[28:01.920 --> 28:06.640]  shoot you better go or stay we're up on this hill we could see thunderstorms off in the
[28:06.640 --> 28:10.520]  distance and clouds going together and you know he goes yeah this looks like tornado
[28:10.520 --> 28:14.600]  weather it was a beautiful spring day and I said oh we'll be all right we're gonna shoot
[28:14.600 --> 28:20.440]  some and my grandmother said no we better go so my grandmother my wife and my two children
[28:20.440 --> 28:26.240]  at the time all got in the car and drove back into Austin about an hour ahead of us they
[28:26.240 --> 28:31.240]  missed the tornadoes and the storms we shot for an hour he goes man I'm telling you that
[28:31.240 --> 28:35.040]  looks bad because you can see the storms coming towards where the highway was we didn't check
[28:35.040 --> 28:40.720]  any computers you know they even had internet at that time this is like 10 years ago or
[28:40.720 --> 28:45.600]  it's about nine years ago and I could and little do we know that off over the horizon
[28:45.600 --> 28:50.160]  out past Fredericksburg and Stonewall that's where the tornadoes would form right when I
[28:50.160 --> 28:57.800]  went through it and again we were just blown off the road by a tornado by the edge of one
[28:57.800 --> 29:07.280]  the state police are like yeah you see that barn blown over a barn 200 yards from where
[29:07.280 --> 29:13.040]  we got blown off the highway it came across us blew us off the highway came by blew us
[29:13.040 --> 29:17.840]  off the opposite direction had just gone and then went over knocked a barn down turned
[29:17.840 --> 29:23.680]  into Stonewall and then went on into Johnson City of course people listening around the
[29:23.680 --> 29:27.920]  country don't know what that means but that's where LBJ was born in a log cabin with no
[29:27.920 --> 29:35.000]  power no electricity and so you better believe I got up here and I fear-mongering about tornadoes
[29:35.000 --> 29:39.160]  because our whole way of life is being gotten rid of over terrorism it's a provocateur doesn't
[29:39.160 --> 29:44.320]  even really exist it's very rare and tornadoes are a real issue now I'm gonna get into world

[37:03.800 --> 37:07.640]  uh... the white house uh... lap dogs are turning on jay carney
[37:07.640 --> 37:10.220]  when he laughs at them and stuff they're really getting angry
[37:10.220 --> 37:13.080]  really realizing what rubes they are
[37:13.080 --> 37:16.600]  uh... again doj targeted fox news reporter's producer
[37:16.600 --> 37:20.360]  calling them criminals uh... arresting uh... just one of the state court people that just
[37:20.360 --> 37:21.840]  told their opinion on
[37:21.840 --> 37:26.080]  on uh... north korea and this is that was about more becoming north korea
[37:26.080 --> 37:27.640]  uh...
[37:27.640 --> 37:30.480]  the google helped of course spy on everybody out for the white house of
[37:30.480 --> 37:34.740]  course they did
[37:34.740 --> 37:37.200]  r n c chief says google uh...
[37:37.200 --> 37:39.480]  says obama forty and slip saying people
[37:39.480 --> 37:44.520]  trade atmosphere of guerrilla warfare yeah that's what they're doing
[37:44.520 --> 37:48.240]  meanwhile immigration bill requires government to scan
[37:48.240 --> 37:51.720]  visas passports for those leaving nation
[37:51.720 --> 37:54.880]  yeah it's it's all about enslavement
[37:54.880 --> 37:57.480]  so you can't get out of the country
[37:57.480 --> 38:00.360]  s as slaves get and they don't get out
[38:00.360 --> 38:04.380]  uh... senate panel ok tax welfare benefits
[38:04.380 --> 38:07.200]  for new immigrants oh yeah you're you're gonna get
[38:07.200 --> 38:11.880]  all the free goodies and citizens are
[38:11.880 --> 38:15.560]  uh... that some of the news uh... now it's twenty four confirmed ed
[38:15.560 --> 38:18.120]  seven drowned in basement
[38:18.120 --> 38:21.680]  uh... ongoing search for survivors at some of what's up on drudge and info
[38:21.680 --> 38:22.640]  wars
[38:22.640 --> 38:25.360]  dot com up on info wars dot com
[38:25.360 --> 38:28.160]  uh... we have a really bizarre video with the
[38:28.160 --> 38:29.160]  the new pope
[38:29.160 --> 38:32.160]  really grabbing the guy by the head and it looks like
[38:32.160 --> 38:35.280]  you know they whisper something to him hey can you get the demons out and i
[38:35.280 --> 38:37.280]  think this is an exorcism going on
[38:37.280 --> 38:39.820]  and the pope grabs them
[38:39.820 --> 38:42.360]  and really praise and the guy
[38:42.360 --> 38:44.080]  goes through something and then
[38:44.080 --> 38:47.880]  looks like he uh...
[38:47.880 --> 38:49.860]  i don't know it looks uh...
[38:49.860 --> 38:51.020]  looks pretty
[38:51.020 --> 38:52.140]  looks pretty
[38:52.140 --> 38:56.080]  looks pretty weird looks like something's going on there
[38:56.080 --> 38:59.160]  uh... cuz i watched uh... a lot of videos of the pope and people brand
[38:59.160 --> 39:02.000]  people in this this is not look like the normal
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.480]  normal thing going on a normal if somebody did that the pope would take
[39:04.480 --> 39:05.940]  their hands off but
[39:05.940 --> 39:09.880]  his hands off but now he didn't until that that looks pretty
[39:09.880 --> 39:12.640]  it looks like something pretty weird going on there's all i can say looks
[39:12.640 --> 39:15.400]  like they asked him to do a little exorcism prayer
[39:15.400 --> 39:19.580]  uh... pretty bizarre video up on info wars dot com
[39:19.580 --> 39:22.260]  i hear some of the other stories monsanto's ceo
[39:22.260 --> 39:24.600]  says public not playing fair
[39:24.600 --> 39:27.240]  basically cries uncle says you're hurting us
[39:27.240 --> 39:29.880]  you're exposing us stop
[39:29.880 --> 39:32.160]  although we're not going to stop did you think
[39:32.160 --> 39:34.740]  as one commenter says in the lian macadu article
[39:34.740 --> 39:38.120]  that you know destroying the earth would be a cakewalk we'll just stand down and
[39:38.120 --> 39:41.780]  let you destroy us and the earth with it should we actually really care about the
[39:41.780 --> 39:42.760]  environment
[39:42.760 --> 39:44.460]  we are real
[39:44.460 --> 39:47.320]  environmentalist or real
[39:47.320 --> 39:50.280]  conservationist i believe in that
[39:50.280 --> 39:53.380]  but not ignoring all the open-air genetic engineering pharmacological
[39:53.380 --> 39:55.960]  cut crops toxic waste dumping
[39:55.960 --> 39:59.720]  overfishing all the hundreds of real issues and you make it all about paying
[39:59.720 --> 40:01.300]  globalist
[40:01.300 --> 40:05.180]  money for what we exhale even new york times called attacks on breathing but
[40:05.180 --> 40:09.100]  said it was needed and then poison light bulbs and smart houses and all this
[40:09.100 --> 40:11.400]  crud
[40:11.400 --> 40:14.620]  and trying to end the human species as we know it this computer merger that's
[40:14.620 --> 40:20.720]  a very important video and an article by mom by uh... lian macadam
[40:20.720 --> 40:23.620]  monsanto's ceo says public not playing fair
[40:23.620 --> 40:26.600]  we got like fifty two crew members here
[40:26.600 --> 40:29.960]  we got two macadam's who aren't related it's kind of lucky we've got an i t guy
[40:29.960 --> 40:31.360]  named macadam we've got a
[40:31.360 --> 40:36.640]  woman named macadam's it's kind of like my lucky macadam's
[40:36.640 --> 40:39.280]  uh... uk independence party
[40:39.280 --> 40:40.880]  draws attention
[40:40.880 --> 40:43.780]  the builder berg two thousand thirteen yeah and
[40:43.780 --> 40:46.680]  you guys gotta remind before i go to england to cover builder berg
[40:46.680 --> 40:49.820]  uh... i've already talked to uh... bloom
[40:49.820 --> 40:53.280]  and her eyes and some others about interviewing a while on their and then
[40:53.280 --> 40:56.280]  coming out to builder berg looks like that's gonna happen lord monkton
[40:56.280 --> 40:59.280]  but i've got to get on back on the phone with them to line all that up
[40:59.280 --> 41:01.520]  so uh... believe this is one year
[41:01.520 --> 41:06.400]  you're going to want to be uh... at builder berg fat guys grab that video
[41:06.400 --> 41:09.120]  but we have it not ok well well then we'll play in a little while
[41:09.120 --> 41:11.440]  but i want to hear from oklahomans who
[41:11.440 --> 41:16.200]  uh... either survive or lost loved ones are your view on
[41:16.200 --> 41:19.500]  al gore's out there of course and uh... the senator
[41:19.500 --> 41:20.720]  white house
[41:20.720 --> 41:24.120]  uh... and others are uh... running around
[41:24.120 --> 41:25.500]  uh... saying that
[41:25.500 --> 41:29.200]  we're all dead if we don't just let them surveil everything we do
[41:29.200 --> 41:30.920]  and bring an environmental tyranny
[41:30.920 --> 41:32.920]  based on carbon dioxide by the way
[41:32.920 --> 41:36.660]  they've done the ice core the mud core samples the student
[41:36.660 --> 41:41.600]  it's well known it thousands of scientific groups have done this
[41:41.600 --> 41:47.600]  the earth has the lowest level of carbon dioxide generally ever recorded
[41:47.600 --> 41:49.400]  it causes
[41:49.400 --> 41:50.640]  desertification
[41:50.640 --> 41:52.600]  it causes plants not grow as fast
[41:52.600 --> 41:54.720]  it causes the oxygen level to lower
[41:54.720 --> 41:57.520]  the earth's atmosphere
[41:57.520 --> 42:01.040]  if you really want to fear monger here and i actually no one does this i've
[42:01.040 --> 42:02.440]  looked at the numbers i'm like
[42:02.440 --> 42:04.320]  i've had scientists on you've heard of my
[42:04.320 --> 42:08.120]  also it's we're in the lowest period the last few thousand years ever
[42:08.120 --> 42:11.260]  any idea what's doing that
[42:11.260 --> 42:14.000]  maybe humans are getting technologically advanced
[42:14.000 --> 42:15.980]  god has let us get to this point
[42:15.980 --> 42:17.720]  my spirit tells me
[42:17.720 --> 42:18.920]  i got tells me
[42:18.920 --> 42:23.720]  writers were needed actually terraform to save the planet
[42:23.720 --> 42:26.940]  and that we found the fossil fuels right in time
[42:26.940 --> 42:30.400]  if you want to really look at the numbers we have the lowest carbon dioxide
[42:30.400 --> 42:31.920]  level
[42:31.920 --> 42:35.040]  ever recorded right now
[42:35.040 --> 42:38.600]  and then it barely goes back up to the industrial revolution last hundred fifty
[42:38.600 --> 42:40.200]  years with coal
[42:40.200 --> 42:43.060]  it's plunged
[42:43.060 --> 42:46.140]  i mean it's been
[42:46.140 --> 42:47.160]  it's been
[42:47.160 --> 42:50.560]  hundreds of times higher than it is like i want to say thousands of memory
[42:50.560 --> 42:52.300]  has searched the term
[42:52.300 --> 42:57.220]  carbon dioxide has been hundreds of times higher than the actual number
[42:57.220 --> 43:00.000]  the point is it's a carbon cycle carbon dioxide
[43:00.000 --> 43:01.060]  oxygen
[43:01.060 --> 43:04.140]  water and light you need heat source
[43:04.140 --> 43:06.000]  water
[43:06.000 --> 43:08.840]  carbon dioxide and oxygen baby
[43:08.840 --> 43:12.860]  that's what makes the earth go round that's what leads life on it
[43:12.860 --> 43:16.760]  the tiny ribbon of life on the surface
[43:16.760 --> 43:20.280]  now they've also found some life that lives near volcanic hot spring
[43:20.280 --> 43:21.880]  ventricles
[43:21.880 --> 43:25.460]  uh... down in the deeper ocean in areas
[43:25.460 --> 43:27.200]  but again heat source
[43:27.200 --> 43:28.300]  water
[43:28.300 --> 43:29.780]  heat source water
[43:29.780 --> 43:33.140]  carbon dioxide oxygen and they're running around
[43:33.140 --> 43:36.940]  they know you're not scared of carbon dioxide
[43:36.940 --> 43:39.440]  of light and of water
[43:39.440 --> 43:41.760]  so they pick carbon dioxide
[43:41.760 --> 43:44.720]  most people go out and say let's ban dihydrogen monoxide
[43:44.720 --> 43:47.040]  they ban dihydrogen monoxide
[43:47.040 --> 43:48.420]  they say let's ban
[43:48.420 --> 43:50.980]  dihydrogen monoxide because of course that's water
[43:50.980 --> 43:53.780]  if you say let's ban sodium chloride most people say let's ban it
[43:53.780 --> 43:55.360]  it's table salt
[43:55.360 --> 43:57.480]  uh... but uh...
[43:57.480 --> 43:59.480]  we've already talked about that in detail
[43:59.480 --> 44:02.960]  the point is is that this is the
[44:02.960 --> 44:05.320]  ignorance level we're getting to
[44:05.320 --> 44:09.840]  uh... where the you know the u s head of the most
[44:09.840 --> 44:11.200]  expensive
[44:11.200 --> 44:14.920]  elitist shotguns in the world out of italy
[44:14.920 --> 44:19.240]  goes to a major trade show just of gun dealers just of gun shops
[44:19.240 --> 44:23.200]  trying to get his you know guns obviously in more stores
[44:23.200 --> 44:27.880]  and the and and the taxi drivers delivering him with seven fine
[44:27.880 --> 44:29.900]  shotguns
[44:29.900 --> 44:33.600]  and they call the police and say it's a terrorist and the police come and raid
[44:33.600 --> 44:35.040]  like it, imagine the cops
[44:35.040 --> 44:37.360]  you took a guy
[44:37.360 --> 44:39.160]  to a
[44:39.160 --> 44:41.560]  big building marked
[44:41.560 --> 44:45.120]  uh... gun dealer show
[44:45.120 --> 44:49.880]  and uh... but see the holy sacrament with these people
[44:49.880 --> 44:54.140]  is responding to tattletales they've got to make that rock star
[44:54.140 --> 44:55.800]  and again it's the ignorance
[44:55.800 --> 44:59.160]  people actually think there's more tornadoes when there's less
[44:59.160 --> 45:03.080]  and a lot of that shows because there's less of an atmosphere
[45:03.080 --> 45:05.120]  the atmosphere is thinner than it used to be
[45:05.120 --> 45:07.600]  look at all the studies on that
[45:07.600 --> 45:10.840]  i'm actually concerned we don't have a more volatile atmosphere
[45:10.840 --> 45:13.680]  uh... they believe there's more tornadoes
[45:13.680 --> 45:18.200]  carbon dioxide levels have been plunging for thousands of years
[45:18.200 --> 45:20.760]  you've got all this going on the public doesn't know about how the atmosphere
[45:20.760 --> 45:22.920]  works they don't listen to
[45:22.920 --> 45:26.120]  you know top meteorologist on this show they don't do the research
[45:26.120 --> 45:29.800]  they just sit there and say it's so scary and and and and and all the
[45:29.800 --> 45:31.400]  surrogates for obama are
[45:31.400 --> 45:36.120]  save us obama from the tornado
[45:36.120 --> 45:40.880]  people folks die unfortunately eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty
[45:40.880 --> 45:44.000]  one eight hundred two five nine ninety thirty one
[45:44.000 --> 45:46.960]  do you have family in oklahoma city were you there did you see it
[45:46.960 --> 45:49.120]  what's your view on
[45:49.120 --> 45:53.220]  this clip we're gonna play them on your calls eight hundred two five nine
[45:53.220 --> 45:57.320]  ninety two thirty one for oklahoma city and surrounding area listeners
[45:57.320 --> 46:02.080]  uh... let's uh... go to this clip though of the videos up on info wars dot com
[46:02.080 --> 46:03.200]  democratic senator
[46:03.200 --> 46:06.220]  use oklahoma tornado for anti g l p grant
[46:06.220 --> 46:08.020]  over global warming
[46:08.020 --> 46:10.820]  and uh... here is the senator
[46:10.820 --> 46:13.460]  you may have a question for me

[46:54.600 --> 46:59.120]  there's always been prairie fires because of lightning
[46:59.120 --> 47:03.360]  there's always been fires around the world there's always been dust storms
[47:03.360 --> 47:07.040]  there's always been tsunamis there's they've even been saying earthquakes now
[47:07.040 --> 47:10.040]  are global warming

[48:15.960 --> 48:22.960]  time to wake up the toilet on wildfires the rain the tornado
[48:25.920 --> 48:28.840]  and he was up there warning about genetic engineering is up there warning
[48:28.840 --> 48:29.760]  about
[48:29.760 --> 48:33.040]  overflowing the season toxic waste of their dumping nuclear reactors i'd be
[48:33.040 --> 48:37.240]  like oh yeah this is serious but no it's just like general fear do what i say

[54:52.960 --> 54:54.120]  uh...
[54:54.120 --> 54:58.440]  i uh... saw somebody driving with an info worse uh... dot com sticker on my
[54:58.440 --> 55:00.120]  way to work but it took me
[55:00.120 --> 55:02.800]  over two hours to get to work today because
[55:02.800 --> 55:06.840]  of the devastation and i drove through took an alternate route and drove
[55:06.840 --> 55:09.520]  through an area that wasn't hit as bad and it was still
[55:09.520 --> 55:13.640]  smash cars and boards and everything everywhere but um...
[55:13.640 --> 55:14.400]  we were
[55:14.400 --> 55:18.320]  uh... at a doctor's appointment about three miles south
[55:18.320 --> 55:19.600]  ground zero
[55:19.600 --> 55:22.800]  uh... near the theater that got hit and uh...
[55:22.800 --> 55:24.360]  we had to take shelter
[55:24.360 --> 55:28.200]  uh... my wife's pregnant and we were at a doctor's appointment and it was pretty scary
[55:28.200 --> 55:30.400]  uh... the lights went out
[55:30.400 --> 55:34.480]  but thankfully you know it missed where we were but we have people we know
[55:34.480 --> 55:36.200]  that were affected uh...
[55:36.200 --> 55:37.940]  a lady my wife
[55:37.940 --> 55:40.680]  uh... works with lost her little girl in that school
[55:40.680 --> 55:44.600]  you know as bad as texas is with tornadoes uh... i always hear about
[55:44.600 --> 55:46.040]  oklahoma
[55:46.040 --> 55:47.000]  uh...
[55:47.000 --> 55:50.360]  isn't oklahoma right up there at the top statistically is the most dangerous
[55:50.360 --> 55:52.840]  tornado alley
[55:52.840 --> 55:53.880]  you know i couldn't
[55:53.880 --> 55:57.760]  uh... accurately for sure but i i would if i had to get i would say
[55:57.760 --> 56:00.880]  for church of the right in the middle of it like you said you know
[56:00.880 --> 56:02.560]  texas gets its share
[56:02.560 --> 56:05.960]  on up in the misery but it seemed like oklahoma bears the brunt of it
[56:05.960 --> 56:06.760]  uh...
[56:06.760 --> 56:09.800]  i mean i remember the may third ninety-nine tornadoes you know i could
[56:09.800 --> 56:11.800]  have to take shelter then too
[56:11.800 --> 56:12.760]  uh... but
[56:12.760 --> 56:14.620]  well fortunately
[56:14.620 --> 56:16.080]  uh... i've seen them
[56:16.080 --> 56:18.300]  uh... living here but i've never actually
[56:18.300 --> 56:22.160]  i've been hit by one but we sure came close yesterday i am
[56:22.160 --> 56:26.240]  the guy that does our law almost had his arm severed off he was in more another
[56:26.240 --> 56:27.620]  friend of mine
[56:27.620 --> 56:28.560]  uh...
[56:28.560 --> 56:29.400]  his wife
[56:29.400 --> 56:31.200]  uh... teachers at that school
[56:31.200 --> 56:34.120]  and she had to take shelter in both of her kids to go there
[56:34.120 --> 56:35.920]  and she got knocked out
[56:35.920 --> 56:38.680]  and one of the kids got a laceration but
[56:38.680 --> 56:42.440]  they made it through but so it sounds like it is the number one is going to be
[56:42.440 --> 56:44.960]  a lot higher than what they're currently saying
[56:44.960 --> 56:50.000]  yeah i i i saw a news report uh... today local news report that said twenty four
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.040]  like what you're saying but uh...
[56:52.040 --> 56:55.080]  you know we had people that were found
[56:55.080 --> 56:58.300]  a lot longer you know after may third there were people that were found you
[56:58.300 --> 57:02.560]  know months later so there's no telling
[57:02.560 --> 57:06.600]  absolutely tornado alley reportedly comes from minnesota
[57:06.600 --> 57:09.060]  downright to austin texas
[57:09.060 --> 57:10.440]  uh...
[57:10.440 --> 57:15.080]  but they also have tornadoes from illinois out uh... new york's adam
[57:15.080 --> 57:17.800]  and they've had a misfar west as colorado
[57:17.800 --> 57:20.840]  but this is always been part of it you know the native americans had names for
[57:20.840 --> 57:21.420]  it
[57:21.420 --> 57:24.360]  but school kids actually believe this is because
[57:24.360 --> 57:28.760]  they're exhaling carbon dioxide is why this is happening
[57:28.760 --> 57:30.600]  it's not a bad here
[57:30.600 --> 57:34.460]  what they teach but it's still a picture of it i just know that
[57:34.460 --> 57:37.580]  like you said the word uh... conservationist came from the word
[57:37.580 --> 57:39.120]  conservative you know we
[57:39.120 --> 57:42.600]  we are a good and decent people and we respect our land and
[57:42.600 --> 57:47.000]  but we don't buy into the you know the religion of you know the globalist
[57:47.000 --> 57:50.680]  well i mean how can sheldon white house get up there and say
[57:50.680 --> 57:54.280]  you republicans in the midwest it's not just you getting killed
[57:54.280 --> 57:56.720]  it's us to your domain it's just
[57:56.720 --> 58:00.400]  it's over the top to blame gun owners for sandy hook we have nothing to do
[58:00.400 --> 58:01.200]  with it
[58:01.200 --> 58:05.260]  and it's over the top to blame people that no global warming being man-made as
[58:05.260 --> 58:06.740]  a fraud
[58:06.740 --> 58:10.720]  and it's an admitted fraud and then they blame us for dead people
[58:10.720 --> 58:13.880]  i mean it when there's always been tornadoes i mean what
[58:13.880 --> 58:15.520]  what is his problem
[58:15.520 --> 58:19.080]  i mean we we we should get mad at him not just laugh at him
[58:19.080 --> 58:21.620]  this guy is a punk and he knows what he's doing
[58:21.620 --> 58:24.940]  i'm glad you made it through and i hope your buddy's arm gets better and
[58:24.940 --> 58:27.560]  you say it got cut pretty bad

[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:54.040]  has killed more than 20 people and injured hundreds and the Democratic
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:58.400]  Party is saying it is the fault of conservatives that God doesn't like us
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:04.800]  that's The Daily Show creator and senator Sheldon Whitehouse we played it
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:09.680]  last hour says that people in the Midwest are also attacking the East
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:13.800]  Coast because we won't pay carbon taxes and that and and that he's actually mad
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:19.800]  at them just like gun owners killed the kids at Sandy Hook sure fault even though
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:23.760]  violent crimes dropped 49% in the last 20 years new Justice Department numbers
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:28.080]  and we actually have lowered the crime rate but it doesn't matter it says so

[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:37.360]  you Sheldon Democrat of Rhode Island care Republicans run off the climate
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:45.000]  cliff a bunch of proverbial lemmings and disgrace ourselves and then he goes
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  into talking about the tornadoes and he goes on to talk about the fires and he
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.760]  goes on to talk about when cyclones tear up Oklahoma and hurricane swamp Alabama
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:59.040]  and wildfires scorched Texas you come to us the rest of the country for billions
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:04.160]  of dollars to recover and the damage that your polluters and deniers are

[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:18.080]  the Bilderberg group and now he's got the new book out to the octopus
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:25.040]  deception a novel that we sell it in for store.com I should add and Bilderberg
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:28.720]  this year now has the EU Parliament and UKIP who's going to be there with me
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:34.640]  demonstrating and you know covering it this year June 6 to the 9th in Watford
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:39.000]  England northwest of London and the the police have been trying to contact Paul

[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:47.240]  meet and talk to him we're well-known journalists we're well-known don't have
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:51.120]  criminal records I've been detained 15 hours in Canada became an international
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:57.200]  story Daniel Estlund's been detained Jim Tucker who just passed has been shot at
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:03.160]  the original Bilderberg sleuth and now the UK Independence Party draws
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:07.400]  attention to Bilderberg 2013 and I talked to the UK Independence Party and
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:11.000]  asked them on air and off air to please come and they said they are gonna be
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.080]  coming probably Nigel Farage the leader of the party which by the way is having
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:24.360]  huge gains in Europe and in the UK they won the last local national election
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:28.480]  that is they have net local election nationwide they just dominated it's now
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:32.880]  the main parties the conservative and Tory and the Liberals are begging them
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:38.840]  begging them Daniel Estlund is in Rome I'm told and we couldn't have him on at
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:43.000]  a better time we're gonna play clips coming up of UKIP there at the EU
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.160]  Parliament because England even though they didn't vote to begin it is now in
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:50.240]  the euro and so they get members of the Parliament though they're ceremonial the
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:53.360]  whole Parliament ceremonial the bureaucrats all the shots they're now
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:57.320]  attacking the globalist Rand Paul is now coming out saying we're going under

[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:05.480]  that's actually what defeats them whatever they say Oh discredits us is
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:09.960]  the truth and what we should be covering doesn't work anymore and again the
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:15.160]  best-selling author I don't know more than 20 languages in his first big

[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:27.680]  gets into
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:33.440]  really gets into things that can't be shed from sources but can only be put in
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:37.240]  a novel form and so he's the award-winning investigative journalist
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:40.320]  best-selling author through story the Bilderberg group he was featured on
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:43.960]  Jesse Ventura's a conspiracy theory television show with myself and say
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:47.720]  great episode and the DVD endgame blueprint for global enslavement Daniel
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:52.320]  is currently the host of RT TV show and he has a new documentary on the
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:58.200]  Bilderberg group scheduled for release this year can't wait to see that Daniel
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:04.760]  you you've heard my introduction do you hear my friend Daniel Estelin of course
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:09.560]  will also give out your website Daniel Estelin calm Daniel so much going on but
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:13.000]  we should before we get into geopolitics and what's happening we should talk
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.800]  about Jim Tucker dying four weeks ago three and a half weeks ago a great
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:35.760]  passing what would you like to say about Jim Tucker my friend
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:53.080]  thanks to my sources at the time few sources that I had a time in the
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:15:00.120]  mainstream Canadian plans to separate Canada to divide French-speaking Quebec
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:04.040]  from the rest of English-speaking Canada and then merge English-speaking Canada
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:08.360]  and the United States into great North America the first time I was on your
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:14.800]  show back in 2004 we talked about this in 2005 was all over news you know the
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:18.520]  front-runner most of these stories and again I'm very grateful to say that
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:23.680]  nobody today can actually bear to say that you or I or you know Jim you know
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:27.400]  at one time might have been conspiracy theories because again these people
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:31.160]  themselves will be simple discredited and just too much proof and too much
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:35.280]  evidence thanks to my work Jim's work and your work to make sure that people
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:40.720]  in the mainstream understand that what we're talking about is not a conspiracy
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:47.160]  theory but a conspiracy reality it certainly is and Daniel there's so much
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:50.760]  I want to get into with you today but but we look at how now Italian
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:55.280]  presidents talk about Bilderberg and and and and members of the EU talk about it
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:59.200]  and now it's been forced into the news more and more though our media here in
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:06.620]  the US still has a quasi blackout is this upsetting Bilderberg that now
[01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:10.720]  they're shadowy criminal activities are public
[01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:43.080]  doing what we can see and this again is becoming patently obvious you know I'm
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:47.520]  in Italy but it's not just the Italian press you can read the French press the
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:51.980]  American mainstream press and all of them you know are talking about the
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:56.960]  question is you know in the mainstream publications is what does the future
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:02.760]  look like tomorrow in one year in one generation and again we can go back and
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:10.720]  again I go back to the 2005 report which I put out back in 2005 top secret
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:18.040]  government studies in the United States and the United Kingdom future over the
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:23.120]  next 25 years the world will turn into a big brother rich nightmare where small
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:28.280]  which only thrives on the backs of a starving population you know after I
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:31.400]  talked to you guys last week about setting up an interview for today I
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:37.480]  went back to your website going way back when you know to your archives and the
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:44.760]  people who are listening if you guys want to see just how spot on Alex Jones was not two
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:50.920]  weeks ago ten years ago eight years ago you know 2005 and so on have a look at
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:57.760]  what Alex Jones was saying big brother nightmare small rich elite thriving on
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:01.560]  the backs of a starving population I'm saying it today it's in the mainstream
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:07.640]  press today and it's what Alex has been talking and drawing everybody's attention to about ten years ago.
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:11.040]  Well I appreciate your kind words but I mean look I mean they write white papers
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:14.760]  ran corporation all of it I was reporting on what they were saying you've
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:19.080]  been reporting on it Jim and and and I guess we do deserve credit but but I mean
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:24.000]  we're not doing it for the credit we're doing it because there's no future if we
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  don't turn all of this around and again Daniel Esterlin is our guest here
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.760]  joining us from Rome today we're gonna go to break in a moment I'm gonna find

[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:58.920]  going to talk about when we come back? Well you know I want to talk about the near and future 2014 we need to see an opportunity to advance mankind toward a new blockage by taking the
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:10.480]  ruins of Darwin's perverse commercialist survivalist natural selection evolution theory and applying these principles to develop what they call social Darwinism and it's again it's in
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:26.800]  British government secret reports UK Ministry of Defense reports US government reports we can talk about that we can talk about how a lot of this stuff is actually just a front where Bilderberg talked about in 2005 and 2006 and 2007.

[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:35.480]  phone line a little bit when we come back but the information is so

[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:24.760]  Esselen is investigative reporter is in Rome right now he lives in Spain we can
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:29.480]  get from him what the EU takeovers like and he predicted it from not predicted
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:33.680]  it from his Bilderberg sources in 2005 we have the articles up on info Wars
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:37.120]  calm I'm gonna pull some of those up where him and Jim Tucker who both have
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:41.320]  good sources said they're gonna get everybody in debt implode Europe I mean
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:46.160]  Daniel in 2006 you talked about what happened that year and you said they're
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:50.280]  gonna jack up the oil prices then they're gonna implode the housing bubble
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:54.160]  in the next two years then they're gonna have a bailout I mean you really have
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:59.120]  Bilderberg sources and I even know who one of them is but I'm gonna just leave
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:02.920]  it at that I'm not gonna get into you still have that particular source but
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:07.120]  explain to people why this is so big Daniel Esselen I mean these people
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:11.920]  really are the smoky room and as you said they're now segueing off into other
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:17.680]  grips our Intel is that that's Google Daniel Esselen
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:22.920]  this may read like a plot from some dystopian Hollywood science fiction film but I
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:26.080]  assure you this is real I know you know this is real and I hope that people
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:29.840]  realize that we're talking about is not science fiction these are the
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:35.040]  conclusions of a report prepared by the British government back in December 2006
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:39.920]  UK Ministry of Defense prepared a secret source document on the future of
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:45.960]  humanity now the report itself was based on top secret negotiation that took
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:51.080]  place at the conclusion of the 2005 build of a conference at the hotel in
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:55.480]  Rotterhagen Germany of course Jim Tucker and I were the only journalist in the
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:26:01.200]  world attended that meeting now this group who attended this particular thing
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:07.000]  and build over 2005 was handed by the building of spirit committee in January
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.880]  2005 before the building meeting itself at the beginning of May now what had
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:17.520]  happened was after the building meeting at finish and most of the attendees had
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:21.560]  gone home on May the 8th a small select group of
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:26.800]  builders had retired to an exclusive links book castle overlooking the
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:32.920]  Tegren see the foothills of the Bavarian out now what basically had happened at
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:37.960]  that meeting itself if you were talking about people tell the world powerful
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:43.920]  people in the world who prepared a detailed report on population natural
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:49.200]  resources availability on conflict prevention on economic issues etc etc
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:54.000]  the people who attended that secret meeting at the conclusion of the
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.560]  building burger meeting in May 2005 or again the president and chairman of
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:03.080]  the building by the 10th Avion Francisco Pinto Boston our former prime minister of Portugal
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:07.240]  David Rockefeller a Timothy Geiser at the time president of the Federal Reserve
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:10.800]  Bank of New York and later Treasury Secretary for the first Obama
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:15.360]  administration Richard Ha the president of the US think-time Council foreign
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:20.480]  relations with the advent of new science and technology related to the genetic
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:24.880]  revolution what again will do the words were saying that they're literally going
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:31.000]  to rewrite our genetic construct and in a span of a generation we have gone from
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.280]  genetically modified plants to genetically modified animals and the
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:38.840]  next step obviously is genetically modified humans you talked about this
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:43.360]  before genetic engineering nanotechnology military applications
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:48.880]  now these men and women were planning no more no less the future of mankind and
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:55.360]  will be decided behind closed doors at the Ringsburg Castle but two years later
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:00.400]  they got the backbone of the most far-sighted report in human history
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:05.800]  which was used by the British government as a once removed a deniable cutout the

[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:45.360]  report on what Monsanto says that they say they're gonna infect everything with
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:50.720]  GMO and then basically humans aren't gonna be able to live unless we go get

[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:20.600]  very slightly orchestrated step-by-step procedure one of the things that they're
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:24.040]  talking about for example I know I know you have to go to break in a second is

[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:34.440]  yesterday I said it was a Washington Post that wrote about you know headline
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:39.160]  Alex Jones says Adam Kokesh has been kidnapped that was the Washington Times
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:43.280]  with the Washington Post I was listening to rebroadcast driving home at like 10
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:47.960]  o'clock last night and heard me say that that was incorrect this is out of the
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:55.120]  Washington Times Senate panel okays tax welfare benefits for newly legal
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:58.680]  immigrants that's when they legalize them all then they get all the welfare
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:04.440]  illegals are to get the welfare and now they're talking about biometrics hatch
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:09.040]  once immigrant fingerprints taken at airports but whatever they put in is
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:14.760]  only for citizens but you can look up where Homeland Security waves illegals

[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:22.880]  get that so remember whatever they tell you something's for that's not it they
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:26.680]  want to get rid of national sovereignty where there's mega corporations above
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:31.640]  the law and all the life extension technologies all the nanotech all the
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:36.920]  good stuff the elite gets we get tested on and then basically dumbed down with
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:41.360]  soft kill weapons and then the population reduced and it's in John P

[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:55.080]  some more about his book itself the new book the octopus deception a novel
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:59.880]  available at info war store calm also an ad I had Joel Skalsyn in here just
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:04.760]  yesterday talking about strategic relocation means where you live living
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:09.280]  in the safest sub region in your area it doesn't mean going to the very safest
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:13.000]  places in America through a wide grouping of things that's why I made the
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.280]  film if you're gonna live in tornado alley you need to have a plan when
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:21.500]  tornadoes come by I covered that big time last year and got called a
[01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:27.080]  fairmonger you need to get the big book strategic relocation and the book the
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:31.680]  secure home is for security issues simple things you can do were robbers
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:35.080]  very hard from the break into your house things you're not going to be told
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:39.160]  things the government does for themselves I mean Joel doesn't brag but
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:43.640]  he's built stuff for billionaires he's built stuff he's advised governments you
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:48.560]  name it that's why we sell the books and produce the film at info war store calm
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:52.120]  and I got Daniel on a little bit late so be with us about five ten minutes in the
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:55.340]  next hour we'll get more into his book but Daniel you've got the floor now in
[01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:58.660]  this segment I'm gonna play a UKIP clip in the EU Parliament now we're
[01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:02.560]  Bilderberg's coming out but these are the people shaping our world these are
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:06.120]  the people pulling the strings is why there's unification of agenda worldwide
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:09.520]  as the globalists are in charge these are the people imploding Europe that
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:15.560]  want 100 trillion every decade of carbon tax money to themselves these are the
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:18.960]  people that run the agenda it's important to know who they are so going
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:25.200]  back to 2005 and 2006 and all the things that you got from your sources break
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:30.640]  down now the latest where it's going how things are going for them our Intel is
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:34.240]  they're morphing into Google and Google's actually at the head of it do
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:37.520]  your sources concur with that Daniel Estel and the best-selling author
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:47.660]  investigative journalist
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:11.520]  I'm talking about the same thing if you actually go back and look at it they're
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:16.440]  talking about increased risk of humanitarian catastrophe caused by a
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:21.720]  mixture of resource pressure and even distribution of wealth the effects of
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:26.480]  disease and a phase of authorities to cope with population growth growth and
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:31.040]  organization again nothing there we've been talking about this for a long time
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:37.440]  but if you start putting it in contact you know to do all the regulation
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:42.760]  you know the objectives of the government in the United States and also
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:47.480]  European community they're all basically going down the same path and the
[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:53.400]  question as one Italian parliamentarian asked just a couple of days ago he said
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:57.420]  does that mean one of humanity's of peril you know talking about wars and
[01:37:57.420 --> 01:38:01.320]  conflict in the Middle East and the answer to that to that individual and
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:06.200]  everybody else based on the political reporters know does not what they're
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:10.080]  saying in their report is with the original civil liberties and again
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:15.000]  talking about this anybody I know in the world about you know the lives of
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.360]  similarities the super which will be protected through technological
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:24.440]  advancements and pervasive surveillance and again the listeners of the Alex
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:29.520]  Joel show go back to the archives you know it's a big brother a look to what
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:35.560]  Alex was saying about you know 2005 2004 2006 this is exactly what we talking
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:40.360]  about pervasive surveillance textual technological advancement and again when
[01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:45.120]  you put it together with intrusive highly responsible and accessible data
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:51.120]  bases we're talking about the is the emergence of the surveillance society
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:55.320]  and the surveyor society will increasingly challenge assumptions
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:59.800]  about privacy which we're seeing right now with corresponding impact on civil
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:03.400]  liberties and human rights and they're concerned about that not because they're
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:07.760]  concerned about human rights but they're concerned about what they call flash
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:16.200]  mobs okay and flash mobs in this report and one of them is the is the strategic
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:22.560]  trends report 2007 2036 they talked about rapid mobilization flash mobs may
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:27.680]  be undertaken by states terrorists and criminals and may involve dispersed
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:32.480]  communities across international borders challenging security forces to match
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:37.640]  this potential agility and ability to concentrate and again what I'm talking
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:42.760]  about what is the solution that they give to these martial law and again
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:46.760]  Alex you've been the forerunner of this you talked about this way back when I
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:51.120]  think you know and your audience knows exactly what we're talking about
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:56.440]  well expanding on that a Don Salazar is working on a story where we've confirmed
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:40:03.560]  the feds in the US are federalizing the local police special units and we're
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:07.000]  doing research on them wearing red armbands in different cities but we know
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:12.720]  that they're federalizing them but here's an example of what's going on in
[01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:20.040]  Pittsburgh a microcosm of this special units and it goes and this is from their
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:28.160]  own police department website red team rapid emergency development to counter
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:36.560]  terrorist but it also says not just that but civil disobedience is in the same
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:44.760]  category on the pittsburgh pa.gov forward slash police forward slash
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:51.120]  speciality underscore units dot hdm pound red and it's the same thing in all
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:59.480]  the cities so protesting is defined as terrorism and because they know folks as
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:03.000]  they enslave everybody and take your bank accounts like they're doing in
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.640]  Europe you're going to resist and you are the people that they secret police
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:13.720]  are going to be targeting or if they take your business or raise taxes to 100
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:18.040]  percent as Reuters reported in France they're going to come after you I just
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:22.080]  wanted to give people Daniel less than a microcosm because the same thing in
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:26.480]  Europe they're federalizing local police same thing in Australia this is a global
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:32.280]  program towards authoritarianism how are things going for the Bilderberg group
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:37.480]  and you have any information on Google meeting the the two weeks starting now
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:42.040]  before and after Bilderberg and and and Bilderberg basically from my
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:49.000]  information passing the baton over to Google more than any other group
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:56.320]  in the pre-selection January 2013 meeting where they you know each country
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:00.800]  pre-select you know their candidates they send in a list of each individual
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:04.600]  country's candidates and then the bill number is there a Canadian left from
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:07.960]  each country X number of delegates discarding Iran's which they don't need
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:12.120]  for this particular year they're talking about particularly you know we're
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:16.680]  talking about Google right now and they're talking about the level of
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:21.640]  sophistication will require concerted comprehensive obligation again this
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:25.880]  from them from their report application of all the instruments and agencies of
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:30.240]  state power together with cooperation from all relevant authorities and
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:35.920]  organizations involved in settling a crisis or resolving a conflict again
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:41.520]  who's the best actually installing a crisis or resolving a conflict obviously
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:46.040]  Google if you summarize everything we see and everything we're talking about
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:50.760]  we can say techniques for overcoming resistance comprehensive application of
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:55.440]  all the instruments of agencies of state power rapid mobilization flash mobs
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:59.800]  pervasive information communication of technology segmentation of society and
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:04.440]  then a clearness and high levels of violence intrusive highly responsible
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:09.520]  responsible and accessible databases the emergence of surveillance society
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:14.320]  illusion of civil liberties humanitarian catastrophe we just had one yesterday
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:19.440]  this is what they are talking about in their reports and these phrases you know
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:24.760]  I just pulled out from different reports over the past six seven years or so and
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:28.880]  I just read it off to you all of these things you know and I'm not saying what
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:32.520]  happened yesterday was man I don't know I'm just saying that humanitarian
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:36.920]  catastrophes for part of original civil liberties because it gives the
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:41.920]  authorities a method and obviously a reason to cut on our liberty to solve
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:46.480]  that absolutely don't let a good don't let a good crisis go to waste as the
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:51.960]  former White House chief absolutely now expanding on that as best I can tell by
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:56.280]  reading all their public stuff and the leaked information plus their propaganda
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:02.480]  it's an organized central government central corporation eugenics program
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:08.320]  to shoot to shut down the infrastructure of the world and only let them operate
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:15.040]  an infrastructure to collapse all existing power grids geopolitical
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:23.960]  economic energy into them to then wage a war of bringing in a selective Dark Age
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:30.400]  against everyone else while their media combines pose as the saviors during the
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:37.600]  crises to orderly herd humanity into the post human age as they call it as they
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:42.000]  prepare to merge with computers and become gods in their own words I don't
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:45.200]  believe they're becoming gods preachers always attack me and say they will fail
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:49.880]  how dare you say they're gods no that's a straw man they believe this and
[01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:53.280]  they're not gonna let the general public have the life extension technology
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:56.640]  they're not gonna let you eat up the resources that's their own words and
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:02.360]  they're bringing in a total cyber warfare brainwashing chemical warfare
[01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:06.800]  in the food and water and air program and it's just going to intensify from
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:14.560]  here on out as their central anti-terror reservations of corporate government
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:20.040]  power kind of like green zones in Iraq run the dehumanization and slaughter
[01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:24.880]  operations outside as they stage the terror as they use weather weapons on
[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:30.640]  us on record as they spray things on us as they do and they send out
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:35.080]  paramilitary forces what about the revolution towards robots that they're
[01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:39.240]  obsessed with getting rid of humans who can refuse orders and going towards
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:59.040]  robots so Daniel Estelan is mind-boggling it's a lot more advanced than anything the government will want you to believe that they have for example Obama's
[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:03.080]  just green lighted a ten-year Manhattan project to wrap the human brain and they
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:07.200]  call the brain activity map project and the fact that DARPA is one of the
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:12.400]  agencies involved tells you a great deal this is technocrats word dream we can
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:18.800]  now power up an artificial brain oh yeah MIT's in the news absolutely I mean
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:23.520]  just to back you up they're in the news today I have a clip on a plan the next
[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:39.800]  hour where they say we're looking at turning off your free will
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:47:02.000]  you know Wisconsin this is what it's all about how far into space is all of
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:06.160]  this just let's go back to minority report and here is some cruelest
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:09.880]  character Jonah Hamilton when he had that radical surgery to place his eyes
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:14.600]  so they can get past security systems you know as he was lying at the top
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:19.760]  recovering from his procedure this tiny robot sneak into the room and scan his
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:23.960]  eyes you know trying to track down you know the fugitive future crime officer
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:28.360]  now the ability to scan wetness and identify people the standard of
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:34.200]  science fiction film but outside of the use of spider like drawing box this is
[01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:38.360]  very much you know present and near future you know if you're talking
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:42.040]  engineering engineers of southern Methodist universities are working
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:50.520]  closely to develop new type of eye scanners oh no no no they now have they
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:54.920]  have eye scanners that can scan you at a hundred two hundred yards away
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:59.680]  they're not being developed to stop a terrorist please understand people
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:04.920]  they're being developed to stop you the last to justify these technologies were
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:08.360]  not written on a whim they were specifically designed to give the
[01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:16.600]  government I want to explain to people something here there are hundreds of
[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:20.360]  books and publications that we cite and what is the endgame calm the online
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:24.480]  bibliography of the film when you hear Daniel desperately going this is on
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:29.800]  record listen to me it's because they are openly saying they're gonna damn off
[01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:36.120]  our technological development only let themselves advance it towards controlling
[01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:40.680]  all of human development and we aren't in the future we're already being
[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:45.280]  soft-killed the cancer rates are exploding we're being murdered Daniel is
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:49.840]  there any way to reverse this because people are waking up but that's a
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:56.480]  minority I go on look at the yuppies they are just in ignorance of bliss what
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:49:13.200]  do we do and replace a person's memories be the use of electromagnetic radiation
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:16.960]  again if you're thinking of men in black Hollywood science fiction you're
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:21.440]  absolutely right except that the technology called amnesia be with fear
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:26.600]  ready to be used at the moment notice and once more a team of neuroscientists
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:32.080]  has actually developed a brain scan based on fighting him about what a
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:37.040]  subject is intending to do this is a nightmare version of minority report
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:41.560]  made reality and this is the future people still talking about microchip in
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:51.400]  your hand look I've talked to you track 24 7 365 a year and Daniel remember
[01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:56.480]  when you and I were saying this 15 years ago we were kooks and now it's just all
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:50:00.000]  mainstream yeah we're listening to you without warrants yeah everything you've
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.800]  ever done has been recorded yeah we're putting cancer viruses in your vaccines
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:08.480]  yeah we're gonna kill you and the public is so mesmerized I mean I talked to one
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:13.960]  of the high-level people he's since gone on to MIT and they actually let me into
[01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:18.440]  some of the areas I'm gonna leave it at that into the psychology department this
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:23.040]  is the above-ground stuff I was able to see all of it was DARPA all of it was
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:29.160]  Defense Department and the and and most of it was just flicker rates and subtle
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:33.760]  rates over mainstream television to put people to put monkeys into a dream state
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:38.600]  and then after they'd kill the monkeys they'll they bring in humans and hook
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:44.760]  them up as graduate students and and they would have a whole wing just on how
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:49.920]  to make women sexually excited with a certain flicker and you know for a year
[01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:53.560]  test and it would say DARPA on the wall and then they would have a whole nother
[01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:59.640]  room on on how to make men upset and that's why people that watch TV they're
[01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:04.160]  already gone it's time for a home security quiz what effective home
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:08.200]  security device is smaller than a coffee cup fakes out burglars into thinking

[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:03.800]  research which you can pull up online on how to turn off your morals how to have
[01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:08.320]  wavelengths they broadcast that make you you know kill your wife and the stuff I
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:13.840]  saw at UT was how to make you hungry how to make you sexually aroused where they
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:20.640]  hook electrodes up to these people brain scans and I was able to see the
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:26.480]  declassified unclassified stuff that was still restricted accidentally I was
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:31.560]  shown video feeds of the monkey farms out in Bastrop 30 miles away from the
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:36.800]  University of Texas and it just goes on year after year testing wavelengths
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:42.320]  flickers sounds programming the brain I mean you're under total assault folks
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:46.400]  and they're undoubtedly on YouTube sending carrier waves over that some
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:51.200]  scientists to pick those up you can read DARPA articles in the major news over
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:54.360]  the years when yeah we're looking at mind controlling you yeah we got
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:58.360]  microwave guns for the protesters now all that'll never happen Daniel last one
[01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:01.560]  we're going to break here in a moment with us 15 minutes into the next hour
[01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:07.080]  but briefly tell people about the octopus project the book available at
[01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:13.860]  info or store calm the the the octopus deception because you know you wrote a
[01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:17.040]  novel why a novel
[01:56:43.860 --> 01:56:49.760]  before deciding to actually write a novel and if you can if you want to get
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:53.280]  killed you have a best wish you don't like this is a nonfiction and I thought
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:57.840]  planning cuts a lot of was killed you know writing it working on a nonfiction
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:03.400]  book based on the investigation into the octopus I thought let's just keep
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:09.200]  another level with 90% of information in that book being very very real and
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:14.800]  exists in the spirit universe sure that's famous I mean there's so many
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:19.640]  books like books Graham Greene's written that are written as fiction because you
[01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:23.480]  couldn't publish it because the publishers won't put it out so so really
[01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:51.320]  this is 90% non-fiction absolutely you know Jim's gone and you know he died
[01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:55.320]  when we come back I really just briefly want to find out from you joining us

[02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:56.800]  your phone calls if you were part of the tornado or or there in Oklahoma and had
[02:00:56.800 --> 02:01:00.680]  any family that survived through it John and Caroline you're up next after Daniel
[02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:07.680]  leaves us and we have the article up on infowars.com NBC Obama scandals take a
[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:12.720]  pause because of tornado and I called Watson this morning and I said they're
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:17.400]  clearly hijacking this for global warming taxes and and and and and to get
[02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:25.200]  us off Benghazi and all that and NBC even even admits that puts things into
[02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:28.440]  perspective yeah let's get rid of the Bill of Rights and Constitution and let
[02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:32.520]  the government be evil because they're saving us from the tornado Daniel
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:36.840]  Eshelins I want to talk just about you in general you know as a journalist a
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:42.080]  researcher do you have hope for humanity I mean in a in a football game here
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:47.400]  I mean Brzezinski says the New World Order's in trouble is that just talk
[02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:51.440]  Hillary says they're losing the infowar do we have a shot in your view of
[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:55.720]  turning this around and what can people do to do that
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:01:57.720]  Well you know first of all we have to understand that this is real
[02:01:57.720 --> 02:02:02.720]  you know and second of all you know just look again at the broader picture
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:10.440]  we've gone from meaningless generalizations, banalities, simplistic extrapolations of early science fiction novels of deep sea monsters
[02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:15.240]  electric submarines, space cannons, moon landings, to nanotechnology, robotics,
[02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:22.880]  cybernetics, artificial intelligence, life extensions you know it won't be long before we can compete as these people say with God
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:30.280]  you know in equal terms for mortality at least that's the point of view and you know we don't know what the future will look like because it hasn't happened yet
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:36.560]  what is beyond any doubt is that we if we are to extrapolate what we know about the world
[02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:41.200]  about the technology, about technological progress we can make a fairly accurate
[02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:46.720]  prediction of what we're to expect of the world around us and I'm convinced that
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:51.760]  these people shall remain history's main protagonist you know because you know
[02:02:51.760 --> 02:02:55.360]  they've been trying they've been going at it for hundreds of years trying to
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:03:00.000]  destroy us one way or another and you know God bless our souls we're still there
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:05.040]  the best human are always getting in the way and I'm convinced that that's going to be
[02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:09.400]  the way of the future I'm convinced that you know the technology is going to be
[02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:12.440]  the way that the world is going to be played out in the future but also
[02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:16.520]  convinced that with a new generation of people the youngsters who are coming up
[02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:21.040]  and who are actually technologically savvy we're going to have more and more people on our side because they
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:26.440]  lead will only be 1% and we will be the rest and we can win this war it's just a
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:30.560]  question of realizing that we're fighting for the future of humanity not
[02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:36.880]  just our lives but the future of every human being on the planet from here on until the earth disappears
[02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:44.080]  you know and blows up or simply evaporates or whatever happens to it you know be billions of years from now
[02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:49.600]  and by the way that's not rhetoric I mean the globalists say they're taking control of human development
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:54.720]  they're taking control of our evolution they're taking control they're going to decide what we do
[02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:58.800]  they're going to decide who lives I mean this is a high-tech authoritarianism
[02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:04.400]  that's what it is high-tech tyranny and people better get that this is a war
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:08.240]  and one thing about the technocracy is it counts on you being a jellyfish
[02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:12.240]  I haven't talked about this yet on air we're going to come back with Daniel and get into Europe he's in the middle of it
[02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:16.080]  and then go to your phone calls but Daniel Estelen
[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:19.520]  you know I did a test and I don't say you should do this but this is a test
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:23.760]  I put mfallwars.com bumper stickers up in public places around Austin Texas
[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:30.000]  put like five of them up just to see if anybody took them down and nobody did
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:36.960]  big ones and again that's just an example I've seen things when I called for micro FM
[02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:40.560]  a nationwide movement for it in the mid-1990s
[02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:44.160]  and a lot of people picked up that call and did put up micro stations across the country
[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:47.520]  but I started that I mean I really one that pushed it over the edge
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:52.480]  and I mean I've seen cities where people put up micros at thousands of watts and run them for years
[02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:55.920]  in defiance of the criminal government getting the truth out
[02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:59.920]  I mean a lot of this is just about taking action
[02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:04.240]  a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research
[02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:08.080]  into why even if I had a pretty good sized meal that I was still starving
[02:05:08.080 --> 02:05:12.560]  and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow
[02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:16.080]  our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world
[02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:19.760]  are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key
[02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:24.080]  minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves

[02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:30.320]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there

[02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:13.760]  spain he's in rome right now reporting what this means for them that i've been
[02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:17.760]  told by the members of parliament and members of the eu parliament are
[02:09:17.760 --> 02:09:21.680]  going to be going to watford and now because of the the locals say
[02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:24.720]  they don't want to pay for security for this global crime syndicate
[02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:27.360]  bilderberg's in the watford paper saying they'll pick up
[02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:31.440]  part of the cost how about all of it how about we're not treated like criminals
[02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:34.560]  as journalists i'm gonna laugh at the police if they let
[02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:37.520]  me into england when they come over and act like i'm a criminal when they know
[02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:40.320]  full well who i am and they've been trying to contact me
[02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:42.720]  by the way i've just got to get around to it calling them back i'll talk to
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:44.960]  them what am i planning you know what i'm
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:51.680]  planning planning to go cover it a media quit acting like it's evil to be media
[02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:54.240]  anyways i mean i go to these events they have cops sitting down next to me at the
[02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:56.640]  restaurant you know they want to blow something up
[02:09:56.640 --> 02:10:01.040]  alex and i'm like what are you a uh 50 year old marine corps
[02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:04.000]  officer with the state department yeah how do you know that
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:07.440]  well i saw the marines earlier getting out of their uniforms in the parking lot
[02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:10.800]  leave me alone you're the ones that'll stage something
[02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:13.840]  you ought to be ashamed of yourself so let's go ahead and go to this clip and
[02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:18.080]  get daniel lessland's take on that this is the eu parliament with
[02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:22.720]  bilderberg being brought up here it is thank you um the next meeting of the
[02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:27.040]  bilderberg group is to be held in england the location is thought to be
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:31.760]  the grove hotel whatford from the 6th to the 9th of june
[02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:35.280]  these annual meetings are summits of the most wealthy
[02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:39.440]  powerful and influential people in the worlds of politics
[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:43.440]  finance and business the biggest mystery surrounding them
[02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:47.440]  is why the mainstream newspapers and broadcasters
[02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:51.760]  have chosen not to report on them since 1954
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:55.840]  however in the internet age their existence can no longer be kept secret
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:59.760]  i've written to all the mainstream press and tv in the uk
[02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:04.320]  asking me if they intend to report on this meeting and if not why not
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:08.000]  i've also submitted a freedom of information request to the hartfordshire
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.200]  police commissioner asking on what basis the policing is
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:15.280]  being provided and who is paying the bill i'm very much
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:19.360]  looking forward to the responses all right you'll you'll hear that man on
[02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:22.080]  this show and i'll probably get to meet him if they let me into england
[02:11:22.080 --> 02:11:25.760]  uh daniel estellan i've got to give credit where credit to do we don't do it
[02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:27.840]  to give the credit but to show the power of
[02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:32.000]  uh the patriot being a scarce man at first but then becoming very popular
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:35.360]  after your cause succeeds to paraphrase mark twain
[02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:40.560]  who i do often quote uh here you were the first what was it like four years
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:43.840]  ago to address the eu parliament the actual
[02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:48.000]  sitting parliament uh on the bilderberg group and since
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.840]  then we've seen members of parliament from italy germany you name it go and
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:54.720]  confront bilderberg the swiss government went from being
[02:11:54.720 --> 02:11:58.640]  mean to our reporters to bringing them right up front and basically
[02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:01.840]  telling bilderberg they weren't going to provide security for them when members
[02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:04.160]  of their their federal government and state
[02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:08.720]  government showed up again the worm is turning this is a
[02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:11.200]  mafia they've been indicted before they've
[02:12:11.200 --> 02:12:15.200]  been caught in lockheed scams this is a crime syndicate meeting with
[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:18.880]  our leaders buying them off and and and the fact that
[02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:22.400]  we've gone from them saying it didn't exist of course they still say that in
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:27.440]  our media pretty shameful for america to all over the world it's now household
[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:30.240]  names how is this affecting them and then let's get into
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:34.480]  what you're seeing happen in europe um in spain greece
[02:12:34.480 --> 02:12:38.560]  uh the looting of the bank account something he predicted now happening
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:42.240]  well you know it's obviously this is exactly what's happening you have uh you
[02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:45.760]  know today state is a very good example state is no longer an independent nation
[02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:49.280]  it's a protectorate it's controlled by european troika by the
[02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:52.400]  you know the european central bank and the people
[02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:56.000]  we do to the top echelon of power of the european
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:59.360]  parliament actually today are in spain as we speak
[02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:03.520]  controlling making sure that spain which supposedly is an independent country
[02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:07.600]  whose president was elected by the people actually have to do
[02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:11.680]  account of what is going on financially not to the people of spain
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:15.680]  to these unelected bankers who came you know from the european community the
[02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:20.080]  same thing is happening portugal in ireland in greece all over europe
[02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:23.360]  and obviously one of the reasons that you keep is actually leading the
[02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:26.720]  campaign to get out of europe is because as they say
[02:13:26.720 --> 02:13:30.320]  europe has done no good to them they have done no good to spain and they've
[02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:32.720]  gotten done no good to anyone but again it's
[02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:36.880]  logical because the idea is and again we've talked about this is the
[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:41.120]  destruction of nation-state republics and in place of nation-states
[02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:44.800]  independent countries would want to have this part of the world union
[02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:48.880]  and that's what we have right now 27 nations in the european core said they
[02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:52.000]  don't belong together and they have no reason being together
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:55.440]  i want to make sure that they're part of this the structure
[02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:57.760]  of the world's economy because it's logical
[02:13:57.760 --> 02:14:00.800]  progress and development is directly proportional to population
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:04.000]  absolutely and that's gotta that's gotta scare them though
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:07.920]  that via ron paul via what you're doing what i'm doing and i
[02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:10.880]  because i talk to these members of parliament there are listeners
[02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:14.800]  a lot of them woke up because of the anti-globalist movement here
[02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:17.840]  the globalists always wanted to deny their existence
[02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:22.480]  but now they're hiding in plain view and just saying they don't exist anymore
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:28.320]  doesn't work the man behind the curtain is being exposed i think this is a real
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:32.000]  victory uh against these people uh by the way the
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:35.520]  octopus deception your new book available at info war store
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:39.120]  dot com uh is finally in english uh i'm going
[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:41.760]  from emory but i read about it in the british and spanish press
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:46.160]  as i scanned foreign press wasn't it number one for 20 something weeks in
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:49.440]  spain exactly number one was the second highest title
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:53.360]  in the history of my publisher which is the second largest publisher in spain
[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:57.680]  and it was that book of the year in spain two years ago number one for 24
[02:14:57.680 --> 02:15:02.080]  straight weeks in spain on every major uh this opportunity to make the
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:06.400]  globalists very happy because again the things we talk about are real and the
[02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:09.920]  book begins with bianca salara being killed and bianca salara
[02:15:09.920 --> 02:15:14.480]  who is a real-life character was killed investigating octopus and i pick up the
[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:17.600]  baton from him and we take the flight of truth and what
[02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:22.160]  you're saying here is they because i've heard that term from
[02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:27.440]  former retired top cia and others that and i've talked to top generals and
[02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:30.480]  people who are over special forces you name it off record
[02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:34.320]  they've told me that it was called the octopus
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:37.360]  and and and so are you saying that's what they call
[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:41.520]  their their organization is octopus well this is exactly i mean
[02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:46.720]  the realm of my novel is it's a novel but where the carpet exists is the place
[02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:50.400]  where government intelligence agencies and secret societies
[02:15:50.400 --> 02:15:54.000]  battle for control of the world and this is exactly how we have against the
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.720]  backdrop of the economic meltdown which we're
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:00.640]  seeing right now you know the government the president you know three heroes of
[02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:05.760]  the novel and octopus are all trying to find these lost trillions of dollars
[02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:09.440]  which were stolen by another organization more powerful than the
[02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:11.840]  octopus itself and that's one of the reasons i couldn't
[02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:15.840]  write it as a non-fiction novel because if i had written it as a non-fiction
[02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:19.520]  novel i wouldn't be talking to you today yeah if you wrote this about the roth
[02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:23.040]  childs they definitely come after you they sued major british papers saying
[02:16:23.040 --> 02:16:26.560]  we're not an octopus we're not puppet masters and the judge said
[02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:34.000]  this trial proved you are absolutely did i just did i
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:37.280]  did i just go too far there uh daniel no no no you did
[02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:40.880]  just shocked me just how much you know i don't know if you've written the whole
[02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:43.920]  read the whole book or brought to it and you saw something in there which you
[02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:47.840]  shouldn't have seen but you definitely are on the right track no this is real
[02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:51.280]  no no no i know it is no no no i mean when i said i've read the book
[02:16:51.280 --> 02:16:54.560]  when it first came out in spanish uh obviously i can read a little bit of
[02:16:54.560 --> 02:16:57.840]  spanish but not much of it i think you guys put like six chapters
[02:16:57.840 --> 02:17:04.560]  out last year yeah so i yeah no no so i i i read those at home one

[02:19:08.960 --> 02:19:12.880]  lot of original news on it as well we're about to redesign prison planet
[02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:15.680]  site used to be bigger than info wars now info wars has just grown and grown
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:19.120]  and grown but i really don't want to neglect prison planet we don't
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:22.720]  but but but uh i i tend to neglect talking about it so
[02:19:22.720 --> 02:19:26.960]  that's some of what's coming up uh and i've got some other news
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:30.640]  from the middle east now israel and syria are shooting at each other
[02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:34.240]  uh it's just the globalists will win we will all lose

[02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:41.680]  i hope people that serve the system love your children
[02:19:41.680 --> 02:19:44.400]  because i know there's an instinct once things get really bad to kind of cling
[02:19:44.400 --> 02:19:48.800]  to the evil hoping you'll be the last to be taken down folks this new world order
[02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:52.320]  is not something anybody wants to sign on to
[02:19:52.320 --> 02:19:56.960]  not just my the the historical facts but in my instincts i know that
[02:19:56.960 --> 02:20:00.240]  okay let's go to john in oklahoma then caroline and noah
[02:20:00.240 --> 02:20:05.840]  uh john i appreciate you holding uh was uh uh reportedly a witness to some of
[02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:08.240]  this or has some some comments we had some amazing calls
[02:20:08.240 --> 02:20:11.360]  earlier of a man whose mother survived in the school
[02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:15.120]  with the children in the bathroom uh john what's your take on all this and
[02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:18.960]  the democratic senator sheldon whitehouse saying that it's conservative
[02:20:18.960 --> 02:20:22.400]  midwesterners fault that you didn't pay al gore money i'm not
[02:20:22.400 --> 02:20:25.120]  kidding that that that that you brought this on
[02:20:25.120 --> 02:20:30.160]  yourself and that how dare you need any federal aid now i mean and he'll
[02:20:30.160 --> 02:20:32.480]  get away with it the media will go oh yes
[02:20:32.480 --> 02:20:36.320]  uh perhaps you should beat yourself with a bullwhip
[02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:39.600]  uh do you want to apologize to the democratic senator
[02:20:39.600 --> 02:20:43.840]  for the tornado sir oh yes yes i'm terribly sorry that
[02:20:43.840 --> 02:20:48.400]  that are uh that we caused this thing but uh those were very charming remarks
[02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:50.960]  and and i enjoyed seeing those on the on
[02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:56.320]  the website this morning uh but really it suit me just fine to uh
[02:20:56.320 --> 02:21:00.560]  for them to just keep all their money uh keep all their homeland security people
[02:21:00.560 --> 02:21:03.200]  away from here because we're oklahomans we can handle
[02:21:03.200 --> 02:21:06.800]  this we've been through tornadoes many times before
[02:21:06.800 --> 02:21:11.040]  uh we'll pull together you are formerly part of texas
[02:21:11.040 --> 02:21:14.880]  so i just want to say you're actually a texan we're annexing you
[02:21:14.880 --> 02:21:18.880]  i'm sorry i was actually uh born in the great republic of texas so
[02:21:18.880 --> 02:21:24.640]  uh but uh i transferred here years ago but i'm being sarcastic okies are great
[02:21:24.640 --> 02:21:27.280]  people i don't know why there's always these stupid rivalries over
[02:21:27.280 --> 02:21:31.040]  over football and stuff or in high school we'd be at a bonfire or something
[02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:33.680]  there'd be okies and let's just beat each other up because
[02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:37.040]  they're from oklahoma just any excuse to get in a fight but
[02:21:37.040 --> 02:21:40.560]  uh again it really started dawning on me as i went to you and i want to hear what
[02:21:40.560 --> 02:21:44.240]  you have to say about the tornado we're glad you're okay think of how
[02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:48.640]  outrageous it is to say conservatives didn't believe in
[02:21:48.640 --> 02:21:51.600]  global warming so now we don't want to give you money
[02:21:51.600 --> 02:21:56.240]  it's your fault i mean what in the world normally i don't want to
[02:21:56.240 --> 02:21:59.440]  use expletives but this really deserves one
[02:21:59.440 --> 02:22:03.280]  and he won't get any trouble for it i'm i'm sorry go ahead
[02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:06.880]  well that's that's fine maybe they know something about the weather that
[02:22:06.880 --> 02:22:11.280]  we're just getting an inkling of but regardless again they can keep their
[02:22:11.280 --> 02:22:13.600]  money i'm really concerned about what they're
[02:22:13.600 --> 02:22:18.720]  going to do to use this crisis to promote their agenda
[02:22:18.720 --> 02:22:22.400]  you know i've already seen the air spaces have been closed down
[02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:25.760]  are we going to get checkpoints are we going to get searched
[02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:29.600]  how are they going to use this and how can we watch out for that
[02:22:29.600 --> 02:22:33.120]  well listen uh we have the article up there that you know they're saying oh
[02:22:33.120 --> 02:22:36.960]  this will make obama's approval rating go up because he cares
[02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:40.000]  you know he's showing compassion and again this sick senator
[02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:45.680]  they take our money the feds do and then send depending on what program
[02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:50.800]  30 cents 50 cents it varies between 30 and 55 cents depending on the
[02:22:50.800 --> 02:22:54.000]  study they send our money back telling us how
[02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:59.120]  to spend it and then lecture us i mean i just everything he said is so
[02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:05.600]  outrageous to an informed involved uh person living in reality uh but yeah
[02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:08.560]  no they've locked the whole place down look i'd be fine the state police locked
[02:23:08.560 --> 02:23:10.320]  it down even the state guard by the governor
[02:23:10.320 --> 02:23:13.600]  but homeland security's in there in charge just 10 years ago homeland
[02:23:13.600 --> 02:23:16.160]  security didn't even well 12 years ago didn't exist
[02:23:16.160 --> 02:23:20.160]  and 20 years ago you wouldn't have the feds there or they got really bad the
[02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:24.240]  president might turret or something why are the feds running everything why
[02:23:24.240 --> 02:23:28.880]  are they federalizing the police locally i mean it's it's outrageous and and
[02:23:28.880 --> 02:23:33.360]  again they'll use any excuse uh to do this
[02:23:33.360 --> 02:23:36.480]  and because they're getting us ready as ron paul and jim rogers say up on
[02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:40.400]  infowars.com to confiscate private bank accounts in

[02:23:53.120 --> 02:23:56.640]  uh what do you want to say about the tornado well
[02:23:56.640 --> 02:24:00.560]  again it's uh it's it's it's a terrible thing it's one of the worst tornadoes
[02:24:00.560 --> 02:24:04.160]  that's hit us but if you look around at all the people
[02:24:04.160 --> 02:24:07.760]  here right now today where they're gathering things for all
[02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:11.920]  the uh people that were affected uh privately uh churches are banding
[02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:16.880]  together forming prayer groups gathering materials uh gloves or
[02:24:16.880 --> 02:24:20.000]  boots things that people might need and the
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:23.280]  things will just appear you know we don't need 80 000
[02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:27.440]  cardboard trailers from fema we don't need any uh
[02:24:27.440 --> 02:24:32.480]  pastures turned into uh trailer parks with those things
[02:24:32.480 --> 02:24:36.800]  we just want to be left alone we can fix this we'll fix it
[02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:40.640]  absolutely uh have you had a chance to survey any of the disaster with your own
[02:24:40.640 --> 02:24:43.760]  two eyeballs to be honest i bugged out of town last
[02:24:43.760 --> 02:24:48.800]  night before it hit and uh i didn't didn't see any of it i
[02:24:48.800 --> 02:24:53.200]  took the governor's advice to stay away and what time did it hit exactly
[02:24:53.200 --> 02:24:59.840]  well i think it was about five o'clock i think so i was on the road when it hit
[02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:02.400]  and and uh i stopped at a little place uh
[02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:06.480]  outside of town where a bunch of other folks in the city had gathered
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:10.160]  watching the tv well there's two things happening here
[02:25:10.160 --> 02:25:13.440]  used to there weren't as many people i mean just 100 years ago there was less
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:16.000]  than half the number and so usually this would have torn up
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:20.800]  some cow pasture not not a giant suburb of oklahoma city uh
[02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:25.280]  but at the same time there's more people so it's worse when it happens
[02:25:25.280 --> 02:25:29.680]  but there are the doppler radar uh imagine if people wouldn't have got the
[02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:32.000]  warning in the old days you couldn't run so
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:33.840]  that's why everybody had to have a storm shelter
[02:25:33.840 --> 02:25:36.720]  but i would imagine we're going to see a lot more storm shelters getting put in
[02:25:36.720 --> 02:25:40.960]  now yeah uh you know the uh the it was
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:44.400]  interesting to hear the the statistics this morning on the uh
[02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:47.920]  how there are less tornadoes than there were before i've lived here almost all
[02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:51.520]  my life and that's over half a century and i've never seen
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:54.320]  a tornado when i was a kid i'd jump in my roadrunner and
[02:25:54.320 --> 02:25:57.920]  go chase them down and couldn't find them so i've never even seen one
[02:25:57.920 --> 02:26:01.600]  just the devastation after it's over but we always picked up
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:05.680]  everybody bands together and we get it done what would you do without fema
[02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:09.200]  though i mean i mean it's the same thing of colon cancer's up we should
[02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:12.640]  preemptively remove our colons uh retina cancer's up let's all remove
[02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:15.680]  our eyes prostate cancer's up let's all remove our prostate
[02:26:15.680 --> 02:26:18.800]  breast cancer's up let's all remove our breasts if you know if you are
[02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:21.840]  predisposed for it you're predisposed people are always
[02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:27.360]  predisposed why is it getting worse now you see because of what they're putting
[02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:30.720]  in the vaccines in the food so we should discuss why is the cancer
[02:26:30.720 --> 02:26:34.560]  getting worse not you know cut our body parts off we
[02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:38.000]  should find the cause and it's the same thing with this there
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:42.080]  are more people out there so even though tornadoes are down to a 60-year low
[02:26:42.080 --> 02:26:45.920]  usa today reports still when they do happen you're going to have our death
[02:26:45.920 --> 02:26:48.240]  counts because now we're 315 million people
[02:26:48.240 --> 02:26:51.280]  god bless you sir glad you're okay let's talk to caroline
[02:26:51.280 --> 02:26:58.560]  in oklahoma you're on the air welcome hello alex i'm a grandmother of four
[02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:01.840]  beautiful little granddaughters congratulations i've been
[02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:05.440]  i've been following you since you were a young man
[02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:11.840]  when you started exposing uh us losing our national parks
[02:27:11.840 --> 02:27:18.960]  and i just want to tell you um i'm really really concerned that
[02:27:18.960 --> 02:27:22.720]  people are not keeping up and understanding
[02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:26.000]  about the technology that's over us to do with ark
[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:32.560]  and skylar and i firmly believe that this is orchestrated
[02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:39.200]  and purposeful man-made and we live right here on this sumatran fault
[02:27:39.200 --> 02:27:42.480]  i'd like for you to talk about some of this sometimes
[02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:47.040]  it's about the uh sinkhole how that's enlarging
[02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:53.280]  and um that this will be a man-made thing when they do this mamadran fault
[02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:57.520]  and so these are to do with the technology that's
[02:27:57.520 --> 02:28:02.080]  in control over us well ma'am i had an air force whistleblower on
[02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:06.240]  yesterday and i showed tv viewers for radio listeners i gave out headlines
[02:28:06.240 --> 02:28:10.320]  type in bill gates weather modification geoengineering london guardian ap
[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:13.280]  reuters they spend department of energy last
[02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:18.800]  time i checked five billion a year in studying weather modification see
[02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:22.120]  under us code title 50 chapter 32 subsection
[02:28:22.120 --> 02:28:28.240]  1528 paragraph b it allows chemical biological radiological
[02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:33.360]  or any other testing even lethal on citizens unsuspecting the
[02:28:33.360 --> 02:28:37.680]  government claims it's allowed to kill us now now it
[02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:41.760]  in the main title it says it's illegal but then in the subtitle it says unless
[02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:46.480]  for law enforcement or research purposes
[02:28:46.480 --> 02:28:50.880]  and i mean i've talked i've gotten the heads of major weather modification
[02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:53.920]  companies on that do it for ski resorts and insurance companies because
[02:28:53.920 --> 02:28:58.320]  just because see ski resorts will go out and i'm gonna hold you over man this is
[02:28:58.320 --> 02:28:59.760]  important i'm gonna put you on hold and come back
[02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:03.920]  talk to you more about when i get this out ski resorts is on record by the way
[02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:06.480]  just the public doesn't know about it it's like if you never saw the atlantic
[02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:09.680]  ocean you would know it's there ski resorts go get insurance and if they
[02:29:09.680 --> 02:29:14.080]  don't get snow they get enough money to survive well
[02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:16.640]  the insurance companies aren't going to pay out on that
[02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:20.080]  so they go there's more than a hundred of these companies i know of
[02:29:20.080 --> 02:29:24.240]  some of them got like 30 40 50 aircraft and they hire them canada does it too
[02:29:24.240 --> 02:29:27.600]  europe doesn't uh switzerland does it and they fly in
[02:29:27.600 --> 02:29:31.440]  and create clouds in the right weather to make it snow so
[02:29:31.440 --> 02:29:35.280]  they're to pay out on the insurance uh and sometimes ski resorts do it
[02:29:35.280 --> 02:29:39.680]  themselves so that's what's going on and that's
[02:29:39.680 --> 02:29:43.120]  just commercial there are they are with it of course
[02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:46.960]  there's weather weapons stuff going on we had floods in texas like 15 years ago

[02:33:31.840 --> 02:33:37.200]  ladies and gentlemen we are here we are back live
[02:33:37.200 --> 02:33:40.480]  look if you knew history i know a lot of you do but for new listeners you would
[02:33:40.480 --> 02:33:44.640]  know you always get a powerful group in
[02:33:44.640 --> 02:33:47.040]  charge they become decadent they become
[02:33:47.040 --> 02:33:49.600]  inbred they become disdainful of the public
[02:33:49.600 --> 02:33:53.040]  and the public deserves disdain i deserve disdain none of us are perfect
[02:33:53.040 --> 02:33:56.640]  and then they start killing everybody even when there's plenty of food and
[02:33:56.640 --> 02:33:59.120]  everything they just say i want to kill everybody
[02:33:59.120 --> 02:34:02.240]  i want to kill my neighbors i want to kill the general public
[02:34:02.240 --> 02:34:06.000]  and they just start killing everybody
[02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:09.200]  usually by human sacrifice or they'll start a war
[02:34:09.200 --> 02:34:14.240]  and humans are exactly the same as we were five thousand years ago
[02:34:14.240 --> 02:34:19.360]  and i don't like the feeling of i'm another species and the
[02:34:19.360 --> 02:34:22.560]  establishment with with national security has taken my
[02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:25.840]  tax money and built a giant military industrial
[02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:30.800]  complex technocratic command system that eisenhower warned us about
[02:34:30.800 --> 02:34:33.280]  in fact i'm going to get that full speech i've done this before but will
[02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:37.280]  you guys get his full speech full speech and i think we bought it from
[02:34:37.280 --> 02:34:44.320]  the national archive for a film in fact we did it was going to be uh
[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:49.360]  skyfall and then we never put it out you notice it was a movie years later
[02:34:49.360 --> 02:34:53.440]  called that i guess brains think alike but the point
[02:34:53.440 --> 02:34:55.440]  is i was gonna do a chemtrail weather
[02:34:55.440 --> 02:34:57.920]  modification film and there was so many patents
[02:34:57.920 --> 02:35:01.840]  and so much proof and so much admission the other chemtrail films are out there
[02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:04.880]  are good but they're like what's going on they
[02:35:04.880 --> 02:35:06.960]  admit it's happening at a government conference but
[02:35:06.960 --> 02:35:10.400]  won't admit it to others i mean it's just like all admitted
[02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:14.800]  but you're searching chemtrail they're geoengineering
[02:35:14.800 --> 02:35:23.120]  high altitude aerosol a rural program you know stuff like that
[02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:26.720]  we got to find that interview in re-air it's online where the head of harp
[02:35:26.720 --> 02:35:30.000]  wanted to come on because he's a listener
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:33.360]  the civilian head and then the colonel was real mad that he was going to come
[02:35:33.360 --> 02:35:35.120]  on it's like i'm going to be listening and i'll
[02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:37.680]  disconnect if he goes into a national security area
[02:35:37.680 --> 02:35:41.440]  and then they disconnected the interview and then call back now don't go there
[02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:45.680]  and that happened on air and and the mad scientist is like
[02:35:45.680 --> 02:35:50.640]  it's not bad when we fire it we ignite the atmosphere click
[02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:55.280]  you can have i i like to light the atmosphere on fire
[02:35:55.280 --> 02:35:59.920]  you don't want to make me angry you wouldn't like to see me when i'm angry
[02:35:59.920 --> 02:36:03.200]  i mean it's like trinity and beyond i use this example a lot
[02:36:03.200 --> 02:36:07.280]  with william shatner where they tried to blow up the atmosphere with hydrogen
[02:36:07.280 --> 02:36:10.080]  bombs and then they tried to blow up the van
[02:36:10.080 --> 02:36:14.400]  allen radiation belt and this is our government and then
[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:18.080]  they were going to try to blow the moon up
[02:36:18.160 --> 02:36:21.920]  by the way if you're a new listener and think i'm joking
[02:36:21.920 --> 02:36:26.400]  the pentagon publicly well i think it was like 1962
[02:36:26.400 --> 02:36:29.840]  until kennedy told him no you can look this up was going to try to quote
[02:36:29.840 --> 02:36:33.360]  change the orbit of the moon with hydrogen
[02:36:33.360 --> 02:36:35.760]  weapons
[02:36:37.280 --> 02:36:41.040]  cuckoo cuckoo and then i'm the one reporting on it
[02:36:41.040 --> 02:36:43.200]  and people aren't going to check that out you know they'll probably have
[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:48.240]  rachel matt i'll go alex jones uh claims there was a plan to
[02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:52.640]  nuke the moon ha ha ha ha ha he claims they wanted to
[02:36:52.640 --> 02:36:57.440]  blow the atmosphere up to i mean these people are nuts they all
[02:36:57.440 --> 02:37:02.160]  need to be locked up in rubber rooms not us
[02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:06.240]  i want there to be a lot of these people have some of their poetry
[02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:09.840]  um top future of people that advise ray kurzweil
[02:37:09.840 --> 02:37:12.880]  in endgame blueprints for global enslavement
[02:37:12.880 --> 02:37:17.040]  yeah it's project a119 the study of lunar research
[02:37:17.040 --> 02:37:20.800]  flights was a top secret plan developed in 58 yeah they were going to do it in
[02:37:20.800 --> 02:37:25.360]  62 the air force the aim of the project was a detonated nuclear bomb on the moon
[02:37:25.360 --> 02:37:28.320]  visible in the naked eye to boost public morale the united states
[02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:32.000]  after the soviet union took an early lead in the space race
[02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:35.200]  yeah that's a different program they had another one to like move it they were
[02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:37.440]  thinking they move the moon it would do better
[02:37:37.440 --> 02:37:41.440]  like not having well their excuse was would the tides won't be as bad these
[02:37:41.440 --> 02:37:45.680]  people are nuts anyways the point is
[02:37:45.680 --> 02:37:49.760]  try to find the trinity clip i bet i bet it's online we've got the dvd back there
[02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:53.600]  where it's like the plan was detonate hydrogen bombs in
[02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:56.880]  the atmosphere to see if they could destroy communications
[02:37:56.880 --> 02:38:00.320]  worldwide when that failed there were discussions of igniting the planet's
[02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:04.000]  atmosphere but the test went ahead but with william
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:08.160]  shatner's voice i can't do it and then i'm the bad guy because i know
[02:38:08.160 --> 02:38:14.640]  about this alex thinks a whole bunch of astronauts have died in secret programs
[02:38:14.640 --> 02:38:18.720]  like what's his name smedley in uh catch the pigeon
[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:23.520]  what's the name of the dog that laughs smedley
[02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:27.360]  you know that'll just have smedley in rachel madhouse place a hologram with
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:30.000]  that dog and then and then they'll go ran paul
[02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:33.600]  says obama needs to be indicted or recent or there needs to be an
[02:38:33.600 --> 02:38:36.640]  independent investigation
[02:38:36.960 --> 02:38:40.800]  you know just just laugh at it alex jones has a secret grouper meeting
[02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:45.840]  with your politicians buying them off right now illegally violating logan act
[02:38:45.840 --> 02:38:51.760]  what's our answer to that oh oh oh oh alex says diabetes is up several
[02:38:51.760 --> 02:38:54.880]  thousand percent and the studies 20 years ago said it was
[02:38:54.880 --> 02:39:00.320]  aspartame even though it's true what do we do saw our legs off
[02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:04.560]  ha ha ha we don't stop
[02:39:04.720 --> 02:39:08.960]  and that's why i i researched this i need a long vacation is really what it
[02:39:08.960 --> 02:39:11.040]  is
[02:39:12.240 --> 02:39:15.440]  because i get to the point the third hour i want to overthrow this desk and
[02:39:15.440 --> 02:39:19.760]  start smashing stuff at a chimpanzee orangutan level
[02:39:19.760 --> 02:39:22.960]  because you know at a primitive level that used to get stuff done you know i
[02:39:22.960 --> 02:39:25.840]  can intellectually i'm going back to your call carolina and noah and cliff
[02:39:25.840 --> 02:39:31.280]  here in a minute i could i could you know deal with this
[02:39:31.280 --> 02:39:35.760]  if it wasn't so over the top horrible
[02:39:36.880 --> 02:39:40.320]  and see what is this is a bunch of inbred billionaires people controlling
[02:39:40.320 --> 02:39:45.680]  trillions they've got you know 10 mistresses and
[02:39:45.680 --> 02:39:48.640]  people be on my show and they'll describe rich people like they've got
[02:39:48.640 --> 02:39:52.480]  multiple beautiful homes and in private jets
[02:39:52.480 --> 02:39:58.800]  they own large areas of manhattan and tokyo
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:03.280]  they're on the boards of a hundred fortune 100
[02:40:03.280 --> 02:40:08.960]  they go and go to snuff parties with little kids folks
[02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:13.680]  it's come out it comes out in the back of the paper
[02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:17.040]  it and when i say back of the paper it comes out on italian tv
[02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:20.320]  russian tv it comes out when they arrest people you know
[02:40:20.320 --> 02:40:24.080]  i hate to talk about stuff like this raping and shooting toddlers
[02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:28.640]  and then they find out where the films are going up to 50 000 a piece they're
[02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:32.720]  flooding hollywood rich people there will pay 50 grand for
[02:40:32.720 --> 02:40:36.880]  a vhs tape of little kids being killed and it's
[02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:39.200]  real
[02:40:39.760 --> 02:40:43.200]  and these people now think they're going to merge with robots and become god
[02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:48.960]  you're not going to become anything you really think you're going to get
[02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:51.520]  away with that because you go to bohemian grove and other places
[02:40:51.520 --> 02:40:55.600]  and do mojo rituals where you put all your sins
[02:40:55.600 --> 02:41:00.240]  or what you call dark energy onto something you fools
[02:41:00.240 --> 02:41:04.880]  you think you're going to cakewalk all this i mean you're out of your
[02:41:04.880 --> 02:41:08.080]  cotton picking mind but i'll tell you who's really out of their minds
[02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:11.840]  it's the people that serve this system let me tell you something if you don't
[02:41:11.840 --> 02:41:16.800]  like torturing little kids you better not sign on to this
[02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:20.960]  now if you're into hellraiser stuff and you really want because i mean that's a
[02:41:20.960 --> 02:41:24.800]  good allegory you really want to open the cube and
[02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:26.880]  turn this loose it's already been turned loose
[02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:30.320]  but you want to open the gate full wide open
[02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:35.840]  there will be burned cities and skeletons in black uniforms laying
[02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:39.040]  around everywhere when this is done
[02:41:39.040 --> 02:41:45.280]  the surface of the earth will be a crispen
[02:41:45.280 --> 02:41:51.440]  death the siege will die under the gmo bombardment hell gate is
[02:41:51.440 --> 02:41:54.320]  being opened you know we have a short film we're
[02:41:54.320 --> 02:41:57.360]  going to put out but it's so shocking i don't even know if i should put it out
[02:41:57.360 --> 02:42:00.160]  called the devil speaks i just thought of that name i don't know it was one of
[02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:03.200]  the levay people had a book named that oh
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:07.200]  yeah the devil speaks with some hot blonde
[02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:11.120]  to make satanism look powerful and like you're going to get sex
[02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:16.880]  that isn't satan satan is a child with her lower mandible blown off
[02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:22.560]  with a tongue flapping with blood spurting begging for mama
[02:42:25.680 --> 02:42:31.520]  the real satanist from the cia and the russian fsb
[02:42:31.520 --> 02:42:39.440]  the real satanist are in british intelligence just like in hellraiser
[02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:49.360]  all you people that think evil sexy and vampires are cool and all that
[02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:55.040]  you're going to find out what evil really is and you're going to beg
[02:42:55.040 --> 02:42:59.200]  and you're going to plead and god is not going to come to your aid
[02:42:59.200 --> 02:43:02.080]  you understand that
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:08.000]  suffer the little children it is better for you to tie a giant boulder around
[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:11.200]  your neck and throw yourself in the deepest sea a
[02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:16.480]  trillion times better quick death than to hurt innocent people and the
[02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:20.240]  government and the cps grab kids and when they cry for mommy they put
[02:43:20.240 --> 02:43:22.160]  them on a bunch of drugs and brain damage them
[02:43:22.160 --> 02:43:26.720]  and they sexually abuse them and it goes on and on and on and on
[02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:30.880]  a system built for scum to be immune from evil
[02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:34.720]  and to get away with all this stuff but you will not get away with it the only
[02:43:34.720 --> 02:43:38.480]  question is will you destroy the planet in the
[02:43:38.480 --> 02:43:40.880]  process and the creator of the universe will
[02:43:40.880 --> 02:43:44.800]  stay your hand you will not be allowed to go all the way
[02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:48.720]  man i read this dark poetry by these people i've got the quotes famous
[02:43:48.720 --> 02:43:51.520]  globalist in in in game where they're like we're just
[02:43:51.520 --> 02:43:54.240]  i'll be honest with you when we get full control we're probably just going to
[02:43:54.240 --> 02:43:57.200]  blow the planet up and if we can create a weapon to destroy
[02:43:57.200 --> 02:44:00.320]  the universe we're going to do it because we're going to go on willing
[02:44:00.320 --> 02:44:03.680]  and the last thing i want is more generations to breathe
[02:44:03.680 --> 02:44:07.200]  tearing air and to have a future just shut down the light
[02:44:07.200 --> 02:44:14.160]  kill these people now i want death hellraiser
[02:44:17.120 --> 02:44:20.240]  and and and we're going to let these people run things
[02:44:20.240 --> 02:44:25.120]  they need to be hunted down
[02:44:27.760 --> 02:44:34.160]  i have become shiva the destroyer so said the inventor of the atomic bomb
[02:44:34.160 --> 02:44:39.120]  death let's go ahead and talk to caroline caroline thanks for holding
[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:42.720]  you were making your point about weather weapons yes um they are doing
[02:44:42.720 --> 02:44:45.680]  everything they can from the scientists we've talked to in the weather programs
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:48.880]  and and and weather uh men and women meteorologists we've
[02:44:48.880 --> 02:44:51.120]  had on and most of what they said 10 years ago
[02:44:51.120 --> 02:44:54.880]  15 years ago has not been confirmed they're trying to
[02:44:54.880 --> 02:44:58.720]  ruin the u.s croplands with the barium salts limb dioxide
[02:44:58.720 --> 02:45:01.760]  and attacking uh and and trying to destroy us
[02:45:01.760 --> 02:45:05.200]  just like they're trying to ship our jobs to europe and and china and
[02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:10.000]  shutting down everything and we're under war this is a globalist
[02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:14.320]  incremental attack and we're under full spectrum war attack i mean look we're
[02:45:14.320 --> 02:45:17.920]  dying cancer rates are exploding and so yes man that's exactly what's
[02:45:17.920 --> 02:45:21.520]  going on and there are natural tornadoes i think
[02:45:21.520 --> 02:45:24.960]  the uh tornadoes going down and from the
[02:45:24.960 --> 02:45:28.800]  meter also i've talked to show that the atmosphere is thinner it's
[02:45:28.800 --> 02:45:31.040]  thick atmosphere hot and cold coming together
[02:45:31.040 --> 02:45:35.120]  to leave it simple that causes these tornadoes
[02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:39.200]  uh and you know tornadoes are way down of course they of course they lie and
[02:45:39.200 --> 02:45:41.920]  say they're way up to try to get carbon taxes
[02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:46.720]  uh but uh i don't know if this was a weather weapon or not but
[02:45:46.720 --> 02:45:50.640]  they can with the right weather uh conditions
[02:45:50.640 --> 02:45:54.480]  they can create and steer uh groups of tornadoes
[02:45:54.480 --> 02:45:57.840]  the question is were helicopters because they use those up close
[02:45:57.840 --> 02:46:02.560]  and small fixed-wing aircraft seen in and around the weather patterns
[02:46:02.560 --> 02:46:07.280]  like like like did people 50 miles out as these storm systems did they see
[02:46:07.280 --> 02:46:11.120]  aircraft in and around the clouds spraying and doing things if you saw
[02:46:11.120 --> 02:46:13.280]  that you better bet your bottom dollar they
[02:46:13.280 --> 02:46:16.240]  did this uh but who knows if they did you know
[02:46:16.240 --> 02:46:19.840]  that's the thing we don't know anything else caroline
[02:46:19.840 --> 02:46:22.880]  well we live on the numeran fault and we can
[02:46:22.880 --> 02:46:26.720]  uh get earthquake insurance here for our properties in our
[02:46:26.720 --> 02:46:32.320]  homes and i find in trying to awaken people
[02:46:32.320 --> 02:46:37.920]  um the hard part is they use logic against insanity
[02:46:37.920 --> 02:46:43.200]  and it's you have to break through that and get them to awaken that
[02:46:43.200 --> 02:46:46.880]  you can't you're logical but they're insane
[02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:50.640]  isn't he's doing these things well ma'am ma'am their subconscious mind is scared
[02:46:50.640 --> 02:46:55.280]  they've been programmed at multi-levels publicly uh into a mass
[02:46:55.280 --> 02:46:59.920]  stockholm syndrome and and and i mean they're like it's such
[02:46:59.920 --> 02:47:02.960]  it's such a big problem they're spraying they're changing the
[02:47:02.960 --> 02:47:06.320]  atmosphere what they can't even balance their checkbook
[02:47:06.320 --> 02:47:09.040]  it's done by design they're on the edge trying to live in
[02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:12.240]  this modern world pay all the taxes do all the regulations
[02:47:12.240 --> 02:47:16.320]  dodge the police i mean i mean i see cops giving poor people tickets for no
[02:47:16.320 --> 02:47:20.320]  reason it makes me physically want to throw up uh you know
[02:47:20.320 --> 02:47:23.120]  as much as i don't still like it i see some rich guy get the ticket i don't
[02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:25.520]  seem to mind uh you know if i get a ticket even if
[02:47:25.520 --> 02:47:28.240]  it's wrong i don't get upset because i've got a little bit of money
[02:47:28.240 --> 02:47:31.120]  i see how they target the poor these poor truck drivers that i know are
[02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:33.040]  barely making it because i know they're going to business
[02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:36.160]  harassed every day on the roads for a little bit of dust on their bumper
[02:47:36.160 --> 02:47:39.120]  but the illegal aliens are above the law and get them out against the illegal
[02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:42.320]  aliens they're being used from an already collapsed society
[02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:47.040]  to collapse this one you see uh
[02:47:47.040 --> 02:47:50.560]  i mean if i could get to and wake up the 30 million illegals i'd probably want
[02:47:50.560 --> 02:47:53.920]  them here but i can't so we've already lost and
[02:47:53.920 --> 02:47:57.120]  they've lost too i mean it's like but everybody will feel like they're
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:01.600]  winning do you see what i'm saying it's it's just incredible how they get away
[02:48:01.600 --> 02:48:04.400]  with all of this and i hear you god bless you ma'am
[02:48:04.400 --> 02:48:10.000]  let's talk to noah in oklahoma uh lockdown and more uh are are you there
[02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:15.520]  in the suburb of moore noah uh i am south of moore
[02:48:15.520 --> 02:48:19.200]  and uh what i wanted to make some observations was
[02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:23.600]  um when they put the uh city of moore on lock are you there
[02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:27.680]  yes sir okay yeah i'm just making sure i'm sorry no brother
[02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:33.360]  okay uh when they put more on lockdown uh they were not even letting homeowners
[02:48:33.360 --> 02:48:36.400]  in which i didn't understand i mean if if if it was me
[02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:39.520]  and i had my family trapped in a cellar or something
[02:48:39.520 --> 02:48:42.880]  and i knew where they were they should allow the the
[02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:46.400]  the man of the home or whoever that wants to go in there to go in there but
[02:48:46.400 --> 02:48:50.160]  but they also um did some interesting things they held
[02:48:50.160 --> 02:48:54.160]  they held students at a high school i think it was the moore high
[02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:57.520]  uh that was not even hit i don't believe it was even hit but they held the
[02:48:57.520 --> 02:49:00.320]  students there they wouldn't let the parents come get them for till eight or
[02:49:00.320 --> 02:49:02.960]  nine o'clock at night no they always do that that's a federal
[02:49:02.960 --> 02:49:07.280]  directive to set the precedent that parents are not
[02:49:07.280 --> 02:49:10.880]  the parents you've heard msnbc that is done everywhere
[02:49:10.880 --> 02:49:14.320]  uh and and and you know again what if your grandmother was sick what if
[02:49:14.320 --> 02:49:16.720]  something was happening what if you had to go to a funeral i
[02:49:16.720 --> 02:49:19.920]  mean i and see that they're doing drills all over the country
[02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:23.600]  where parents attack the school trying to get their kids because under a big
[02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:25.680]  attack they've said you're not getting your kids back
[02:49:25.680 --> 02:49:29.040]  they're going to make you come turn your guns in and and the cops are like that
[02:49:29.040 --> 02:49:31.680]  will never happen really that i told people about this
[02:49:31.680 --> 02:49:36.160]  plan to start keeping the kids 15 years ago for my federal sources
[02:49:36.160 --> 02:49:39.200]  yes sir well the guy that called in earlier i don't know if he really was
[02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:42.400]  from obama he said it hit at five o'clock no it hit
[02:49:42.400 --> 02:49:45.440]  at it it was a 20 mile long tornado i was
[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:52.000]  here and it was 20 miles long and uh it tracked from 2 p.m till about
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:56.560]  3 34 o'clock and it dissipated but it was a short-lived sure four o'clock's
[02:49:56.560 --> 02:50:00.000]  what i thought was the end of it yeah uh well you know i don't think that guy
[02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.240]  was uh one guy was saying he was calling him
[02:50:02.240 --> 02:50:07.040]  from tennessee his mom was in the school in more than what it
[02:50:07.040 --> 02:50:10.800]  was well uh it's interesting that uh that when
[02:50:10.800 --> 02:50:14.400]  they put the lockdown on they they did have checkpoints i mean
[02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:16.880]  it's absolute checkpoint city and they've got the
[02:50:16.880 --> 02:50:21.520]  the uh what i don't get is why our globalist governor mary fallin

[02:54:18.720 --> 02:54:22.720]  government is famously corrupt it's kind of like
[02:54:22.720 --> 02:54:27.680]  chicago on the gulf of mexico
[02:54:27.680 --> 02:54:32.160]  and they will do stuff like put speeding signs behind a tree
[02:54:32.160 --> 02:54:36.000]  where the interstate goes from 70 to 50 and then make you pay
[02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:40.640]  on the spot no judge no jury you just pay them it's like mexico
[02:54:40.640 --> 02:54:44.720]  and then in texas they've had cops in the little corrupt towns
[02:54:44.720 --> 02:54:48.240]  it's been a big national stories you've all heard of it or they'll pull people
[02:54:48.240 --> 02:54:52.320]  over and go let me see your wallet that's five hundred dollars i believe

[02:55:01.600 --> 02:55:05.200]  guy was in jail for two and a half years no judge no jury family thought he'd
[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:08.240]  been kidnapped and dead and they don't even know why he was in
[02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:12.800]  there he just argued with him so we're gonna lock you up and the guy lost
[02:55:12.800 --> 02:55:15.760]  almost all his weight they described him as like robinson caruso
[02:55:15.760 --> 02:55:19.440]  they just shove a little bit of food every once in a while under the thing
[02:55:19.440 --> 02:55:23.280]  we ain't seen him in a couple years you know how it is
[02:55:23.280 --> 02:55:27.440]  yeah well you being not respectful to the officer
[02:55:27.440 --> 02:55:33.280]  and they've had famous cases where one woman fought because she was the heir to
[02:55:33.280 --> 02:55:37.200]  some billionaire it was like 10 years ago she had like
[02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:40.800]  four thousand dollars in her purse and they took that and took her
[02:55:40.800 --> 02:55:45.280]  cadillac and took her to jail no judge no jury no charges we're gonna
[02:55:45.280 --> 02:55:49.920]  shake you down do you agree to all this we're testing the money and if we find

[02:56:02.880 --> 02:56:07.440]  using the money i know that's probably because
[02:56:07.440 --> 02:56:11.920]  touchy with the cocaine meanwhile the government ships the
[02:56:11.920 --> 02:56:16.320]  cocaine in launders the money brings the opium in grows the opium helps

[03:08:46.880 --> 03:08:50.240]  bad imitation of hank hill
[03:08:52.320 --> 03:08:56.000]  i want to hit some final news here in the overdrive portion
[03:08:56.000 --> 03:09:00.480]  of this this hour i've already covered this but i want to talk about it again
[03:09:00.480 --> 03:09:03.840]  i think i'm gonna do a special report for the nightly news tonight because i'm
[03:09:03.840 --> 03:09:07.680]  pretty angry right now and i just thought about what we put up
[03:09:07.680 --> 03:09:12.480]  with from the cutting edge
[03:09:12.480 --> 03:09:17.280]  of tyranny and and that's really what the democrats are
[03:09:17.280 --> 03:09:20.400]  the republicans are horrible globalists bought and paid for at the highest
[03:09:20.400 --> 03:09:23.040]  levels by the same interest but they at least
[03:09:23.040 --> 03:09:28.720]  have to play the part of pro-liberty freedom uh common sense
[03:09:28.720 --> 03:09:31.760]  lower taxes free market national sovereignty
[03:09:31.760 --> 03:09:37.120]  and there are good people i know rand paul i know he's a good guy
[03:09:37.120 --> 03:09:40.960]  uh sometimes you play a little bit too much politics maybe
[03:09:40.960 --> 03:09:45.280]  maybe um i know people that know ted cruz we've interviewed him but we don't
[03:09:45.280 --> 03:09:49.120]  know him well at all uh that he's a real guy that
[03:09:49.120 --> 03:09:52.240]  that remains to be seen but i like more and more what i'm seeing
[03:09:52.240 --> 03:09:57.040]  um i know ron paul's for real i've known him 17 years
[03:09:57.040 --> 03:10:02.000]  and i know uh people like walter jones are for real
[03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:04.480]  and a lot of other congressmen have been on the show and have said they're
[03:10:04.480 --> 03:10:07.520]  listeners and a lot of which have not been on the
[03:10:07.520 --> 03:10:11.440]  show and obviously i've run into them at events
[03:10:11.440 --> 03:10:13.840]  or i've tried to get them on and talk to them
[03:10:13.840 --> 03:10:17.520]  and they're like listen there's too much heat if i come on your show but one day
[03:10:17.520 --> 03:10:20.720]  i will because what you're saying is becoming mainstream they will write me
[03:10:20.720 --> 03:10:25.760]  over the calls for it i think the time for that is is really
[03:10:25.760 --> 03:10:28.640]  over not to even need i mean i got a congressman on my show unless they're
[03:10:28.640 --> 03:10:30.880]  breaking something listenership goes down
[03:10:30.880 --> 03:10:34.480]  and i don't really do stuff just for listenership my main drive is tell the
[03:10:34.480 --> 03:10:37.200]  truth tell it like it is it becomes entertaining just because i'm
[03:10:37.200 --> 03:10:42.000]  a nut sometimes you know real people are nutty
[03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:46.960]  but the point is that i sure don't want to be these real nuts that sit there all
[03:10:46.960 --> 03:10:50.240]  scared of what their neighbors think scare everybody else thinks while the
[03:10:50.240 --> 03:10:52.400]  whole society goes in hell in a handbasket
[03:10:52.400 --> 03:10:56.560]  and we sit here and see the outrageous video
[03:10:56.560 --> 03:11:01.920]  up on info awards.com democratic senator uses oklahoma tornado
[03:11:01.920 --> 03:11:07.760]  for anti-gop rant over global warming it's an anti-state rant it's an
[03:11:07.760 --> 03:11:12.800]  anti-oklahoma rant and you know the daily caller jeff poor
[03:11:12.800 --> 03:11:16.400]  is a great writer but it's worse than that we
[03:11:16.400 --> 03:11:22.320]  should write a new article telling it like it really is
[03:11:22.320 --> 03:11:27.040]  but senator implies that oklahomans don't
[03:11:27.040 --> 03:11:32.880]  deserve support from rest of nation that's what that piece of trash said
[03:11:32.880 --> 03:11:35.360]  in fact so many times we're going to think of a headline that really really
[03:11:35.360 --> 03:11:37.840]  says what it is and i can't come up with one bad enough
[03:11:37.840 --> 03:11:42.800]  that's short how about like opportunistic senator
[03:11:42.800 --> 03:11:46.640]  who wants carbon taxes to line his and other globalist pockets because he's
[03:11:46.640 --> 03:11:49.360]  involved in carbon trading i looked it up this morning you know
[03:11:49.360 --> 03:11:52.800]  this is what the real headline would be but it'd be too long
[03:11:52.800 --> 03:11:57.840]  fear mongers at a witch doctor level propaganda as if the sun wouldn't come
[03:11:57.840 --> 03:12:00.960]  back if we don't all flagellate ourselves with
[03:12:00.960 --> 03:12:04.960]  bullwhips like we're guilty for every natural
[03:12:04.960 --> 03:12:09.840]  disaster and blames oklahomans for their senator
[03:12:09.840 --> 03:12:13.840]  helping shoot down fraudulent carbon taxes
[03:12:13.840 --> 03:12:19.120]  and implies that rest of the nation is sick of the midwest and the south
[03:12:19.120 --> 03:12:23.040]  not capitulating to their bizarre religious cosmology
[03:12:23.040 --> 03:12:26.160]  of collectivism
[03:12:28.720 --> 03:12:33.520]  i mean listen i'm so close to this that i tend to not get mad i know
[03:12:33.520 --> 03:12:36.640]  that's part of the tyranny process with all of us even though we consciously
[03:12:36.640 --> 03:12:39.520]  know it don't like it we're so used to we're like yeah they're
[03:12:39.520 --> 03:12:43.520]  running checkpoints downtown with the tsa searching bags without
[03:12:43.520 --> 03:12:46.880]  warrants in austin oh i guess we might send a crew might
[03:12:46.880 --> 03:12:50.960]  try to go yeah you know i've known about this so long was coming
[03:12:50.960 --> 03:12:56.160]  oh they had the national guard out running checkpoints at the park
[03:12:56.160 --> 03:12:58.800]  as if you could stop a real terrorist from attacking as if the terrorists
[03:12:58.800 --> 03:13:02.000]  aren't really the globalist you know just it's just kind of like
[03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:06.720]  yeah we knew that shoe was going to drop yeah we knew that was coming yeah we
[03:13:06.720 --> 03:13:11.680]  knew that was going on and then they write all these books how
[03:13:11.680 --> 03:13:14.560]  they're going to build this technocracy and how they're going to live forever
[03:13:14.560 --> 03:13:17.360]  and how we're going to be in these you know
[03:13:17.360 --> 03:13:20.800]  squalor zones they're going to release bio weapons to get rid of us
[03:13:20.800 --> 03:13:27.760]  and it's all just plagiarized malthus garbage from 250 years ago
[03:13:27.760 --> 03:13:34.320]  malthusian stuff from sir malthus of london who said herd the poor into small
[03:13:34.320 --> 03:13:39.680]  compact areas and uh get smallpox and other plagues and
[03:13:39.680 --> 03:13:43.920]  don't give them any type of you know drainage and just kill them
[03:13:43.920 --> 03:13:48.640]  thank god the crown was even more evil and said we don't want to kill good
[03:13:48.640 --> 03:13:50.880]  slaves that's what they were they were they
[03:13:50.880 --> 03:13:53.040]  didn't call them slaves because they were slaves
[03:13:53.040 --> 03:13:58.400]  they said we'll send them to the new world and to australia
[03:13:59.680 --> 03:14:04.080]  we'll send them to penal colonies which only made it stronger
[03:14:04.080 --> 03:14:08.080]  thank you and so we built a secret army for liberty
[03:14:08.080 --> 03:14:13.120]  in the united states and in australian places
[03:14:13.120 --> 03:14:17.680]  with the renaissance blood but now we've been taken over and are now the army of
[03:14:17.680 --> 03:14:20.480]  the new world order
[03:14:20.480 --> 03:14:23.840]  the united states and australia and new zealand
[03:14:23.840 --> 03:14:30.960]  were the globalist prison planets to use a frank herbert
[03:14:30.960 --> 03:14:36.080]  type salusa secundus uh analogy no that's not a sexual position
[03:14:36.080 --> 03:14:39.360]  i will assure you now uh let's get to this
[03:14:39.360 --> 03:14:46.400]  uh next little piece here my friends prophets of science fiction by the way a
[03:14:46.400 --> 03:14:50.480]  correction i did that laser beam video partially directed by my son myself and
[03:14:50.480 --> 03:14:53.280]  rob new we all co-directed it but my son his name is
[03:14:53.280 --> 03:14:55.440]  not public yet his mother doesn't want to be public
[03:14:55.440 --> 03:14:58.800]  but it will be he wants it he loves liberty he's almost as tall as me now
[03:14:58.800 --> 03:15:02.240]  it's like a giant at 10 years old or maybe i'm a midget but
[03:15:02.240 --> 03:15:06.560]  he's i'm i'm 5 10 he should be a 5 11 i hunch over now but the point is
[03:15:06.560 --> 03:15:15.040]  uh for nine and a quarter anyways the point is is that um
[03:15:15.840 --> 03:15:18.960]  what was it going off into that story of the laser beam
[03:15:18.960 --> 03:15:24.000]  real star wars lego laser battle video that's featured on our youtube channel
[03:15:24.000 --> 03:15:28.400]  uh i said in there and gunpowder was invented 2800 years ago in the whatever
[03:15:28.400 --> 03:15:31.440]  dynasty it was like 1600 years ago and i got
[03:15:31.440 --> 03:15:36.000]  that wrong or 1500 whatever it was but they had
[03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:39.440]  pre-development of gunpowder 2000 plus years ago so i
[03:15:39.440 --> 03:15:42.320]  it doesn't matter i just want to correct things when we're wrong
[03:15:42.320 --> 03:15:46.320]  uh and i and some of my french wasn't exactly right either earlier
[03:15:46.320 --> 03:15:49.760]  so i want to paul i got i got some of that little bit wrong hey we're always
[03:15:49.760 --> 03:15:52.640]  talking about this so let's go to this here they are
[03:15:52.640 --> 03:15:55.840]  throwing it in our face from robert hindline wrote this more than 50 years
[03:15:55.840 --> 03:15:58.640]  ago and now it's becoming a reality at mit
[03:15:58.640 --> 03:16:02.240]  here's prophets of science fiction uh somebody i really admire ridley scott
[03:16:02.240 --> 03:16:06.800]  on the discovery channel here's a clip of this
[03:16:06.800 --> 03:16:11.040]  dr rebecca sachs of mit is puzzling out how it might be possible
[03:16:11.040 --> 03:16:15.040]  to control another person's moral choices
[03:16:15.040 --> 03:16:19.120]  we don't think of any parts of our thoughts or consciousness as
[03:16:19.120 --> 03:16:23.280]  being patterns of neural activity in our brain but everything you think every
[03:16:23.280 --> 03:16:26.640]  experience you have any idea that goes through your head
[03:16:26.640 --> 03:16:30.800]  what that is is a pattern of electrical activity electrical firing
[03:16:30.800 --> 03:16:34.000]  going from one cell to another inside your brain
[03:16:34.000 --> 03:16:39.760]  and moral judgments that's all it is in her quest to uncover a vaccine so you
[03:16:39.760 --> 03:16:43.120]  never get upset at you
[03:16:43.120 --> 03:16:47.600]  uses a new technology called transcranial magnetic simulation
[03:16:47.600 --> 03:16:52.800]  or tms to temporarily short circuit specific regions of a person's oh
[03:16:52.800 --> 03:16:57.040]  electromagnetic will make you behave a coil that makes a magnetic pulse up
[03:16:57.040 --> 03:17:00.320]  against the skull like your cell phone and then when we can pulse on a really
[03:17:00.320 --> 03:17:03.520]  strong magnetic field
[03:17:07.040 --> 03:17:10.960]  and that was non-threatening fire all at once simultaneously
[03:17:10.960 --> 03:17:14.880]  and then after that basically shut down a little bit oh it's like electroshock
[03:17:14.880 --> 03:17:18.560]  therapy but to manipulate the neurons guiding moral judgment
[03:17:18.560 --> 03:17:22.960]  dr sachs focuses on the region of the brain where scientists believe these
[03:17:22.960 --> 03:17:29.840]  decisions we did this to emingway and then he he was no longer a problem
[03:17:29.840 --> 03:17:33.120]  for sure he fried his beautiful mind
[03:17:33.120 --> 03:17:36.000]  letting you think about other people's thoughts
[03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:40.160]  and then we oh we made your mind
[03:17:40.160 --> 03:17:45.120]  there's activity in this brain region if we made those neurons
[03:17:45.120 --> 03:17:49.360]  sluggish if we made them bad at their job that we could change your moral
[03:17:49.360 --> 03:17:53.760]  judgment with fluoride in a very predicted way and gmo
[03:17:53.760 --> 03:17:59.600]  oh how much tms is affecting judgment dr sachs uses a morality tale
[03:17:59.600 --> 03:18:04.800]  about a fictional woman named grace see this microwave does this to you
[03:18:04.800 --> 03:18:09.120]  just like the cell phone coffee break grace goes to make the coffee we can
[03:18:09.120 --> 03:18:12.240]  teach you to not stand up for anybody around you
[03:18:12.240 --> 03:18:17.200]  so you accept assimilation dangerous we're coming from the corporate board
[03:18:17.200 --> 03:18:21.760]  hail satan oh excuse me let me go back into mpr talk
[03:18:21.760 --> 03:18:25.920]  and coffee actually that powder is just the sugar that the scientists use every
[03:18:25.920 --> 03:18:28.560]  day and so when grace's friend drinks their
[03:18:28.560 --> 03:18:33.200]  coffee with that white powder in it she's fine nothing bad happens how much
[03:18:33.200 --> 03:18:36.160]  blame does grace deserve for putting that white powder in the
[03:18:36.160 --> 03:18:40.880]  coffee average test subjects will consider grace's actions to be a seven
[03:18:40.880 --> 03:18:44.960]  out of ten on a scale of evil behavior
[03:18:44.960 --> 03:18:48.480]  but what's evil even though her friend is unharmed most consider
[03:18:48.480 --> 03:18:54.000]  grace's intention to kill as immoral but when a test subject reads the same
[03:18:54.000 --> 03:18:59.840]  tale whilst undergoing tms the results are surprising right before
[03:18:59.840 --> 03:19:04.080]  he's going to make that moral judgment then he would get the magnetic field
[03:19:04.080 --> 03:19:07.040]  pulse in his right and now he likes killing
[03:19:07.040 --> 03:19:11.200]  we know that grace thought that the powder was dangerous toxic poison so we
[03:19:11.200 --> 03:19:15.200]  would say it was totally morally wrong and also letting you watch violence
[03:19:15.200 --> 03:19:19.600]  pms to your right tpj millions of times on tv that's all you eat popcorn makes
[03:19:19.600 --> 03:19:22.720]  you start liking it that balance by making neurons in your
[03:19:22.720 --> 03:19:26.480]  right tpj a little less good at their job a little less good
[03:19:26.480 --> 03:19:30.480]  a little less darpa was bragging about that like 12 years ago 13 years ago i
[03:19:30.480 --> 03:19:33.920]  saw an article in the baltimore sun they're like well
[03:19:33.920 --> 03:19:37.440]  actually we're practicing in cities calming you
[03:19:37.440 --> 03:19:40.560]  it's all right because you're going to be too brain damaged when we finally
[03:19:40.560 --> 03:19:44.320]  release the bio weapon that'll be after they've got the
[03:19:44.320 --> 03:19:48.160]  robots in place the next 10 15 years 20 years we hold them back
[03:19:48.160 --> 03:19:51.680]  and then the robots will clean out and we'll let the cities rewild and
[03:19:51.680 --> 03:19:56.000]  it'll be a great new age for the scientific elite
[03:19:56.000 --> 03:20:25.600]  oh we love you so much oh yeah
