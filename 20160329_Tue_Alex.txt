[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:30.440]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:44.240 --> 00:49.120]  infowars.com we are standing outside the Holiday Inn in Jamesville Wisconsin just
[00:49.120 --> 00:53.800]  off the interstate this is I-39 here and just interestingly enough it's a toll
[00:53.800 --> 00:58.080]  road all the way from Chicago to up here so this is of course highway funding
[00:58.080 --> 01:01.000]  that was paid for with the by the federal government but now people are
[01:01.000 --> 01:05.480]  paying again to use the roads but that's just a side note now behind me you see
[01:05.480 --> 01:08.680]  the signs is Jamesville conference center and that's where Donald Trump will
[01:08.680 --> 01:13.280]  be speaking tomorrow at 4 p.m. now earlier today in the lobby here at the
[01:13.280 --> 01:17.480]  Holiday Inn Express there is a protest stage with about 70 protesters blocking
[01:17.480 --> 01:22.720]  the entryway into the Holiday Inn they actually had officers even stationed in
[01:22.720 --> 01:26.520]  front of it to keep people from going in joining or more protesters joining the
[01:26.520 --> 01:32.200]  area and then about six of them locked arms using tubes and these handcuffed
[01:32.200 --> 01:37.000]  devices and would not leave they staged a sit-in protest inside the lobby
[01:37.000 --> 01:41.640]  eventually all six were arrested there was four women two men all from the
[01:41.640 --> 01:46.280]  Madison area and Kit Dan was you were telling me is about 10 p.m. that they
[01:46.280 --> 01:50.320]  were that they were arrested so the protest kicked off around seven lasted
[01:50.320 --> 01:53.920]  between 30 minutes and an hour and and then they and then they made those
[01:53.920 --> 01:57.560]  arrests so at this time there's definitely gonna be more interesting
[01:57.560 --> 02:02.920]  action going on tomorrow I talked to a female police officer just a bit ago and
[02:02.920 --> 02:06.520]  she said you better get some sleep because they're gonna get here early they
[02:06.520 --> 02:10.440]  expect people arriving as early as like 5 a.m. so it should be very interesting
[02:10.440 --> 02:13.760]  kit what are your thoughts so far come on in here what are your thoughts so far
[02:13.760 --> 02:16.540]  about what's been going on when I called the police department earlier they
[02:16.540 --> 02:19.960]  told me I asked him is this unprecedented for all these kind of
[02:19.960 --> 02:23.680]  protests to happen he's like oh this is kind of we're kind of used to it and I
[02:23.680 --> 02:27.080]  remember earlier reading a newspaper article from past month about a local
[02:27.080 --> 02:31.760]  pet shop here that had was selling dogs that end up dying to parvo like a week
[02:31.760 --> 02:34.920]  or two later and they had a similar protest like the one we saw here at the
[02:34.920 --> 02:40.640]  hotel and then like we remember we saw the state satanic protests going on like
[02:40.640 --> 02:45.080]  the Mattis in the state capital past couple years the hell Satan protests
[02:45.080 --> 02:50.040]  exactly and then we had a Scott Walker last time I was in Wisconsin was about
[02:50.040 --> 02:54.120]  five years ago and Scott Walker had that big deal with the I think it was the
[02:54.120 --> 02:57.640]  teacher union so you had massive protests there to put all in context
[02:57.640 --> 03:02.920]  Wisconsin's a very volatile state when it comes to protest so expect to see a lot
[03:02.920 --> 03:06.680]  of action tomorrow and as we discussed earlier Roger Stone mentioned on the
[03:06.680 --> 03:10.840]  show today that this is Ted Cruz's last gasp essentially if he doesn't make it
[03:10.840 --> 03:14.840]  here he might as well drop out of the race we know K6 not gonna drop out he's
[03:14.840 --> 03:19.360]  basically there to the end but with this you know new Ted Cruz sex scandal
[03:19.360 --> 03:22.800]  looming who knows what's gonna happen and also something that we debunked
[03:22.800 --> 03:26.080]  today was there there was a Craigslist ad that was saying you know we're gonna
[03:26.080 --> 03:30.560]  pay Bernie the Bernie Sanders campaign is gonna pay people $15 an hour for a
[03:30.560 --> 03:33.760]  four-hour block to come and protest tomorrow and then they listed an
[03:33.760 --> 03:37.120]  address where you could go and meet up well that address happened to be the
[03:37.120 --> 03:41.880]  local wastewater plant so either you know somebody's doing ultra wizard
[03:41.880 --> 03:45.880]  trolling as what's been going on or it's just you know people making fun but
[03:45.880 --> 03:50.280]  there's no at this point I don't think there's any truth to Bernie Sanders
[03:50.280 --> 03:53.520]  paying protesters to be here but we'll find out tomorrow we'll be asking the
[03:53.520 --> 03:57.040]  protesters questions we have a lot of things that we want to know why they're
[03:57.040 --> 04:01.080]  here what they're doing it before who's backing them and and other such you know
[04:01.080 --> 04:03.800]  instances of what's going on yeah I think there's a lot of divinization
[04:03.800 --> 04:07.160]  going on to try to push the Bernie Sanders people away from Trump supporters
[04:07.160 --> 04:10.440]  and kind of get them to fight each other because as long as the two populist
[04:10.440 --> 04:14.080]  candidates are fighting each other you know the establishment wins so we're
[04:14.080 --> 04:17.400]  seeing a lot of that and then we're in also want to point out that last time
[04:17.400 --> 04:20.920]  was in Ferguson like two years ago during the protest we start seeing agent
[04:20.920 --> 04:24.480]  provocateurs come out of Chicago now Ferguson was a lot farther away from
[04:24.480 --> 04:28.480]  Chicago than what we are now I think we're about 100 miles or so yeah but
[04:28.480 --> 04:31.800]  it took us about an hour and 45 minutes to get here yeah so I expect to see the
[04:31.800 --> 04:35.880]  agent provocateurs a lot of black lives my folks there are a bunch of these
[04:35.880 --> 04:40.000]  special reports up on info wars.com we're also tweeting them out I'm gonna come
[04:40.000 --> 04:44.680]  back and launch the full transmission but our reporters are in Wisconsin the
[04:44.680 --> 04:49.200]  scene of where we're reportedly going to have bikers and the Trump people and the
[04:49.200 --> 04:53.760]  police and all the socialists and everybody else in a clash stay with
[04:53.760 --> 04:59.080]  us. The State Department and Pentagon order the families of US diplomats and
[04:59.080 --> 05:03.760]  military personnel Tuesday to leave post in southern Turkey due to security fears

[05:08.520 --> 05:13.320]  staffers at the US consulate in Adana and other locations must leave the so
[05:13.320 --> 05:17.640]  called order departure notice means the relocation costs will be covered by the
[05:17.640 --> 05:21.520]  government in a statement the military's European command said the step
[05:21.520 --> 05:26.080]  allows for the deliberate safe return of family members from these areas due to
[05:26.080 --> 05:30.200]  continued security concerns in the region the move comes amid heightened
[05:30.200 --> 05:34.320]  security concerns throughout Turkey due to the ongoing fight against the Islamic
[05:34.320 --> 05:38.680]  state militants in neighboring Syria and Iraq and it was to be accompanied by an
[05:38.680 --> 05:42.800]  updated travel warning advising US citizens of an increased threat of

[06:13.840 --> 06:18.320]  water they took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in and when the

[08:41.600 --> 09:05.800]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show we
[09:05.800 --> 09:12.280]  aren't accelerating towards what these social engineers believe is a singularity
[09:12.280 --> 09:22.480]  basically godlike omnipresent knowledge I personally don't think that we'll ever
[09:22.480 --> 09:31.440]  reach a true singularity but there will be many singularity like events that are
[09:31.440 --> 09:36.600]  lesser forms of what is predicted there will be massive events where you see a
[09:36.600 --> 09:44.640]  information singularity where basically almost all news and all information is
[09:44.640 --> 09:54.120]  made obsolete when it comes to who is actually codifying it and codifying now
[09:54.120 --> 09:57.640]  exactly what that's gonna look like I'm not sure but here's an example of it
[09:57.640 --> 10:05.040]  today newspapers gobble each other up to survive digital apocalypse Bloomberg
[10:05.040 --> 10:12.560]  news there's a lot of reasons this is happening it's not just the digital age
[10:12.560 --> 10:18.240]  it's these newspapers take central information and duplicate it locally and
[10:18.240 --> 10:23.280]  then tow party lines and so the public knows there's no reason to go get that
[10:23.280 --> 10:28.400]  newspaper because there's nothing compelling or real in it it's all
[10:28.400 --> 10:33.320]  management groups trying to control public opinion while denying they're
[10:33.320 --> 10:38.760]  doing it the only newspapers that have done well and continued on have gone
[10:38.760 --> 10:46.880]  into multimedia have gotten involved in community events and have given the
[10:46.880 --> 10:51.520]  public real value when it comes to information that actually helps them
[10:51.520 --> 10:56.520]  instead of delivering them into the hands of more corruption now it's
[10:56.520 --> 10:59.240]  interesting we have this article out of Bloomberg today because there's one in
[10:59.240 --> 11:04.440]  the telegraph and there is another that has come out in major German newspapers
[11:04.440 --> 11:10.080]  there's a boil down in zero hedge on it and here are the headlines China
[11:10.080 --> 11:21.120]  newspaper editor resigns over media control the public's the public
[11:21.120 --> 11:27.120]  resignation comes amid louder calls from quote authorities for media to tow the
[11:27.120 --> 11:32.840]  Communist Party line here's another one top German journalist admits mainstream
[11:32.840 --> 11:39.200]  media is completely fake we all lie for the CIA now in Germany more than
[11:39.200 --> 11:47.280]  anywhere in the world the newspapers take direct orders from NATO from Interpol
[11:47.280 --> 11:52.720]  from the CIA from the Pentagon Germany was never free after World War two
[11:52.720 --> 11:57.320]  Germany never got its sovereignty back they merged East and West Germany as
[11:57.320 --> 12:09.200]  part of a consolidation deal I personally in the 80s watched things like the
[12:09.200 --> 12:14.720]  government take East German defectors over train them as journalists and send
[12:14.720 --> 12:20.800]  them back to set up newspapers and engage in propaganda against the Russians
[12:20.800 --> 12:25.120]  and East Germany which absolutely deserved it I'm not saying that that was
[12:25.120 --> 12:30.760]  a bad thing the point is now they have become the communist socialist system
[12:30.760 --> 12:34.760]  they claim that they were fighting and they push Soviet-style propaganda
[12:34.760 --> 12:39.440]  Stasi East German-style propaganda on us and you need to know German
[12:39.440 --> 12:44.600]  newspapers are the most controlled in the world in a quote somewhat free
[12:44.600 --> 12:49.720]  country sure Communist China's worse North Korea's worse but when you get down
[12:49.720 --> 13:00.880]  to absolute manifest bull it's the German newspapers and he goes over the
[13:00.880 --> 13:05.000]  whole deal and it's got a bunch of other mainstream news reporters in the US
[13:05.000 --> 13:10.600]  saying the same thing but but this is how it works it came out the LA Times
[13:10.600 --> 13:18.200]  editor was a CIA agent and was ordered to discredit Gary Webb and his Dark
[13:18.200 --> 13:23.080]  Alliance articles for the San Jose Mercury be that he was winning awards for
[13:23.080 --> 13:27.040]  almost set to win the Pulitzer prize for when he wrote a book of indicating
[13:27.040 --> 13:31.440]  himself before it published they shot him twice in the head they killed him
[13:31.440 --> 13:37.160]  better than a hammer and our media is not as controlled as it used to be because
[13:37.160 --> 13:42.920]  major actors and other people that had the will went and financed kill the
[13:42.920 --> 13:49.760]  messenger that told the truth and that movie is like a documentary I it really
[13:49.760 --> 13:55.520]  freaked me out because it was so accurate who's that actor that plays the
[13:55.520 --> 14:01.760]  he's the last-born movie character he's he's the Hurtlocker actor he's a great
[14:01.760 --> 14:13.880]  actor point is he financed that movie on the other hand you got Robert De Niro
[14:13.880 --> 14:20.920]  you're my distorted sorry she was in Jeremy Renner yeah Jeremy Renner thanks
[14:20.920 --> 14:27.560]  on the other hand you got Robert De Niro who cozies up and puts out the CIA
[14:27.560 --> 14:30.800]  styled movie the Good Shepherd that's actually a pretty accurate and true
[14:30.800 --> 14:35.200]  story about skull and bones the CIA Yale you name it and one of her Robert De
[14:35.200 --> 14:39.080]  Niro is a pretty good guy overall but kind of a classical liberal and so he
[14:39.080 --> 14:41.960]  was gonna put out the movie vaxxed and give it a bunch of attention at his
[14:41.960 --> 14:46.000]  Tribeca Film Festival and for the first time ever he selected a film he wanted
[14:46.000 --> 14:51.600]  to be seen and the media came in and bullied him and said how dare you put a
[14:51.600 --> 14:56.320]  film out with the discredited you know doctor who's the director Andrew Wakefield
[14:56.320 --> 15:04.600]  and he backed off and said okay I won't show it so that's just an example Wakefield
[15:04.600 --> 15:08.160]  by the way has been vindicated that his study was real the government had done
[15:08.160 --> 15:11.480]  two secret studies previous with the same findings they already knew it was
[15:11.480 --> 15:15.720]  causing gut flora problems and toxic toxicity in the intestines and
[15:15.720 --> 15:22.240]  basically poisonous bruise growing with yeast and other compounds in the guts
[15:22.240 --> 15:28.360]  that were basically toxifying and poisoning the brain that's one problem
[15:28.360 --> 15:32.560]  that's causing the huge surge in autism especially in boys because their
[15:32.560 --> 15:37.240]  blood-brain barrier isn't as thick as girls that's well known and more evidence
[15:37.240 --> 15:41.800]  mounts more evidence intensifies but they ran that hoax saying Wakefield was
[15:41.800 --> 15:46.000]  discredited and then Wakefield wanted me to be involved in vaxxed he wanted to
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.960]  shoot it and produce a lot of it here we let him shoot some of it here but I'm
[15:48.960 --> 15:52.560]  so busy I saw his distraction I said listen I'm not going your Hollywood route
[15:52.560 --> 15:55.960]  it's gonna get censored and I don't want to mess with Hollywood there are a
[15:55.960 --> 16:00.840]  bunch of cowards already been down this road and so I guess he's not mad at me
[16:00.840 --> 16:03.960]  I mean I let him use the studio some but I said I got a daily news show to do I
[16:03.960 --> 16:08.160]  got a radio show to do I got a small crew we're not a production house but his
[16:08.160 --> 16:12.080]  films out I mean it's pretty good hasn't been seen by the public yet I've seen it
[16:12.080 --> 16:23.040]  and it's powerful and DeNiro saw it he's got an autistic son of course and he
[16:23.040 --> 16:26.760]  wanted to do good but he's just too controlled too bully but at the end of
[16:26.760 --> 16:31.680]  the day it's good news that it's been banned now because that will make more
[16:31.680 --> 16:36.240]  people want to see it and then if Wakefield would just take that and
[16:36.240 --> 16:40.200]  promote it that way as an underground suppressed thing it would be huge but
[16:40.200 --> 16:45.680]  instead the mindset is just keep going and groveling to Hollywood truth is
[16:45.680 --> 16:49.960]  nobody really cares that much about Robert DeNiro and Jenny McCarthy and
[16:49.960 --> 16:54.800]  people outside of their acting when actors go out into their own little thing
[16:54.800 --> 16:59.960]  on their own it doesn't go anywhere it's a dead end the systems control you have
[16:59.960 --> 17:05.600]  to go out in the wilderness of media and create your own films and your own
[17:05.600 --> 17:09.880]  systems and put them out for free if you want to have a hundred million people
[17:09.880 --> 17:13.560]  watch your film I have produced a film that was watched over a hundred million
[17:13.560 --> 17:18.320]  times on YouTube and Google alone loose change I have produced other films that
[17:18.320 --> 17:25.600]  have been seen over 200 million times one of them 80 million I know what I'm
[17:25.600 --> 17:32.080]  doing but everybody else oh just absolutely knows exactly how to do it

[34:52.000 --> 34:56.160]  America's greedy and evil we should pay for any illegal aliens health care not
[34:56.160 --> 35:01.120]  just for them to have a baby of course so now there is sick tourism where people
[35:01.120 --> 35:07.480]  get a visa as a tourist they come here and everything's free we're collapsing
[35:07.480 --> 35:15.280]  but if your big mega banks that loan the country the money out of nowhere and
[35:15.280 --> 35:18.080]  you're gonna end up owning everything well you're gonna get people in debt
[35:18.080 --> 35:24.160]  aren't you just like those payday 300% interest loans or more than happy to
[35:24.160 --> 35:30.800]  give poor people loans on their paychecks so they can go buy lottery
[35:30.800 --> 35:36.960]  tickets it's like watching that video in those photos of Easter with the pez
[35:36.960 --> 35:41.040]  dispenser factory and they had a pez event they promoted on Twitter and
[35:41.040 --> 35:44.520]  Facebook and a thousand people are so showed up and they're supposed to have
[35:44.520 --> 35:47.840]  little kids run out and get the little pez dispensers but instead the people
[35:47.840 --> 35:57.320]  rioted and ran over the little kids and trampled women for the pez as long as
[35:57.320 --> 36:01.600]  it's empty and fantasy and some corn syrup or a worthless lottery ticket or
[36:01.600 --> 36:06.040]  worthless Bernie Sanders or a worthless Hillary or a worthless Obama or a
[36:06.040 --> 36:13.000]  worthless just empty lie people love it they like fantasy land they like to
[36:13.000 --> 36:18.080]  believe for five minutes they're gonna become rich and powerful or they got
[36:18.080 --> 36:23.920]  something free or they beat somebody I got the pez dispenser
[36:23.920 --> 36:28.720]  Austin Rick link letter made the famous film about slackers and Austin is
[36:28.720 --> 36:32.080]  really a headquarters of it but it's all over the country where people go get
[36:32.080 --> 36:35.800]  degrees they go get jobs and then they pretend they're intellectuals they get
[36:35.800 --> 36:40.440]  a job and they pretend they're doing things at the job they don't really
[36:40.440 --> 36:44.400]  want to have a job they just want to pretend they have a job and then take
[36:44.400 --> 36:47.680]  selfies about their job
[36:50.320 --> 36:55.160]  it's all where you make this little fake life like dress up like you're a four
[36:55.160 --> 36:58.120]  year old girl dressing up as a princess or four-year-old boy dressing up as a
[36:58.120 --> 37:06.600]  cowboy as the lone ranger it's called fantasy land and in fantasy land you
[37:06.600 --> 37:12.000]  got a big portion of people that will believe anything they're told
[37:13.720 --> 37:19.560]  that's the type of garbage we're talking about you can argue that well
[37:19.560 --> 37:23.680]  you're just believing in Trump hoping he's better hoping that he's something
[37:23.680 --> 37:31.680]  different no not really the establishment is having a heart attack a full
[37:31.680 --> 37:37.420]  seizure they're gouging their eyeballs out basically with daggers they're
[37:37.420 --> 37:41.400]  pulling their hair out running around in circles because they know he's never
[37:41.400 --> 37:46.640]  been beholden to him he's been his own guy and he knows we've got two-sided
[37:46.640 --> 37:52.120]  unfair trade deals that are 101 meant to shut our industrial base down and he
[37:52.120 --> 37:58.040]  says it's not fair and he intends to do a few basic things he may be dangerous
[37:58.040 --> 38:01.840]  too he's got them scared to death although they tell these people are
[38:01.840 --> 38:07.000]  bad news these people are you Genesis and the fact that they're scared of the
[38:07.000 --> 38:11.280]  Donald Trump tells me that he's good and regardless he's making him steal the
[38:11.280 --> 38:17.080]  election in front of everybody that is unprecedented he is making them come out
[38:17.080 --> 38:21.360]  and go your vote never counted oh no we can change the rule ever we want to
[38:21.360 --> 38:26.120]  ignore your popular vote and Hillary's going well yeah I did take the delegates
[38:26.120 --> 38:28.840]  early on from Sanders to make it look like I was winning and now I'm actually
[38:28.840 --> 38:31.800]  winning the people are voting for me as they think he's a loser though he just
[38:31.800 --> 38:40.280]  won three states over the weekend a primary and so now it's in the LA times
[38:40.280 --> 38:45.080]  that Sanders is going and stealing the delegates now well yeah if they're
[38:45.080 --> 38:48.120]  undecided if they can be go to Hillary why not go to him and they're actually
[38:48.120 --> 38:53.760]  like he's stealing things now I mean he talked about spin machine baby this is
[38:53.760 --> 39:00.440]  it so let's go over some of this economic news and let's go over some of
[39:00.440 --> 39:07.560]  the political news here briefly though a lot of people ask me and I'm gonna do a
[39:07.560 --> 39:12.400]  joke video about this pretty soon I mean I see it in the comments on M4s I see
[39:12.400 --> 39:20.200]  it on YouTube I see it on my Facebook where I was at my parents and Buckley my
[39:20.200 --> 39:24.840]  cousin Anthony you charting were over news over was wise man he was over his
[39:24.840 --> 39:29.680]  girlfriend and you know we're sitting there in the hot tub and we do a Facebook
[39:29.680 --> 39:34.560]  mentions on Easter for about an hour and people like I can't believe his
[39:34.560 --> 39:42.960]  energy you know he must be you know on drugs cocaine meth whatever and I sat
[39:42.960 --> 39:48.400]  there and I read that and it let me realize how screwed up we are as a
[39:48.400 --> 39:52.880]  society that the fact that I'm mad that they're openly announcing that they're
[39:52.880 --> 39:57.480]  stealing the popular vote and basically canceling the election and then I'm mad
[39:57.480 --> 40:00.400]  that they're pushing vaccines that they know have cancer viruses in them and
[40:00.400 --> 40:04.640]  they know that the cancer is communicable that's even the New York Times now and
[40:04.640 --> 40:08.640]  they're bringing in a world government where these elites are exempt but one
[40:08.640 --> 40:13.480]  us we undercarbon taxes while Leonardo DiCaprio flies around on jumbo jets
[40:13.480 --> 40:20.600]  private planes the size of jumbo jets I mean literal 747s you name it and it's
[40:20.600 --> 40:25.280]  so crazy it's the new royalty it's total discrimination and I'm being lectured
[40:25.280 --> 40:31.280]  and I'm angry and people go that guy's got too much energy I mean I've had one
[40:31.280 --> 40:36.400]  cup of coffee today I used to have three cups of coffee wanted about noon or one
[40:36.400 --> 40:39.720]  and then one of about five I was gonna work late now no more than two a day
[40:39.720 --> 40:51.440]  maybe you shall have tea instead and it is because I'm upset I'm involved I'm
[40:51.440 --> 40:58.760]  taking action I'm motivated and if you are ever around executives at real
[40:58.760 --> 41:03.800]  companies or around say special forces troops or on anybody that's successful
[41:03.800 --> 41:06.760]  or a conductor that's into music they're working 14 hours a day they're
[41:06.760 --> 41:11.320]  obsessed with it they love it they have passion I mean I'll just tell you Tim
[41:11.320 --> 41:15.040]  Kennedy is going to be doing some news reporting and stuff as a liaison not as
[41:15.040 --> 41:18.280]  an employee but as a contractor he wants to work with us I want to work with us
[41:18.280 --> 41:22.320]  he's one of the more famous special forces guys in history and most of what
[41:22.320 --> 41:27.360]  he's done secret you know the real exploits are pretty darn amazing let's
[41:27.360 --> 41:34.480]  say beyond somebody like Chris Kyle and they're out doing shoots this whole week
[41:34.480 --> 41:37.560]  getting up at 5 a.m. I don't have to tell him anything to do he just comes up with
[41:37.560 --> 41:42.760]  all these great ideas and he's just off and going just they came and did four
[41:42.760 --> 41:46.880]  blood draws two weeks ago on him over a week and cannot believe there's no drugs
[41:46.880 --> 41:51.760]  in it guy doesn't even drink caffeine doesn't drink beer bouncing off the walls
[41:51.760 --> 41:59.840]  in a focused way that's what a souped-up strong alpha males like that's what
[41:59.840 --> 42:06.880]  built civilization folks and that's the type of guy that leads special forces
[42:06.880 --> 42:11.120]  groups that's who they are and maybe they've been siphoned off and sometimes
[42:11.120 --> 42:14.960]  do some stuff that isn't good the point is is that there's the world of men and
[42:14.960 --> 42:18.480]  the world of people with energy then there's the world of TV heads and the
[42:18.480 --> 42:22.840]  average person is in a near-sleep trance and watches mainstream TV all day on
[42:22.840 --> 42:27.440]  record and his brain damaged and they watch me up on air and they say that
[42:27.440 --> 42:35.200]  guy's got to be on drugs it's incredible ladies and gentlemen they mean
[42:35.200 --> 42:41.000]  illegal drugs the truth is that I might be on one prescription a year for nasal
[42:41.000 --> 42:48.040]  spray or things like that in my life I tried hard drugs a few times in high
[42:48.040 --> 42:52.800]  school and college you know different things hated it all just oh this is
[42:52.800 --> 42:57.280]  horrible because I'm already high I don't need it the truth is I have been a
[42:57.280 --> 43:01.520]  drinker and have not drunk in my life for years and drink you know it's gotten
[43:01.520 --> 43:05.760]  drunk too much you know been in control but you know what it's because I can't
[43:05.760 --> 43:11.600]  handle my energy at night I need to stop thinking and I've used sedatives
[43:11.600 --> 43:16.320]  that's what alcohol is is a depressant to take the edge off it's the opposite I
[43:16.320 --> 43:22.240]  don't need speed I should have never gotten on coffee and I'm phasing it out
[43:22.240 --> 43:27.560]  buckwheat quit because it's just a drug you get used to needing it that's it so
[43:27.560 --> 43:33.160]  yeah I'm on coffee I'm on caffeine small amount of it that said now let me get
[43:33.160 --> 43:39.120]  back on the news what has supercharged me is super male vitality now anthroplex
[43:39.120 --> 43:45.720]  and the X2 nation I died on the good halogen because it clears out and blocks
[43:45.720 --> 43:49.440]  the bad halogens that glom on to all your hormones and endocrine systems and
[43:49.440 --> 43:58.520]  basically to dumb it down clog it all up and it's it's got known cold pressed
[43:58.520 --> 44:02.560]  herbs down into an oil form super concentrated it's the dry form anthro
[44:02.560 --> 44:06.520] plex it's less money but excellent as well we try to give people you know the
[44:06.520 --> 44:10.040]  premium and we just want it's also super good but a lower price they can go
[44:10.040 --> 44:13.960]  together as well quite frankly I can't take anthroplex and super male together
[44:13.960 --> 44:19.160]  I take one of the other or I do get too aggressive but it's just taking a
[44:19.160 --> 44:23.040]  personality it's already there and going another level so technically you know
[44:23.040 --> 44:26.760]  you're not allowed to call mother nature a drug and you know what I don't want to
[44:26.760 --> 44:32.440]  call it a drug it's not drugs it's mother nature just like raw milk is so
[44:32.440 --> 44:36.040]  much better for you than boiled basically liquid cheese that clogs up your
[44:36.040 --> 44:40.240]  heart pasteurized milk pasteurized milk is the counterfeit it's what kills you

[54:28.400 --> 54:33.760]  amazing is amazing she did a better job than the Republican leader of the

[54:54.000 --> 54:57.960]  we that stupid Hillary complains about the super PACs when she's the number
[54:57.960 --> 55:01.840]  one person funded by him compared to everybody else but right now let's go
[55:01.840 --> 55:07.640]  to Obama lecturing the media on how to do their job from MSNBC this is really
[55:07.640 --> 55:13.800]  rich here it is the hallmark of good journalism false equivalency all too
[55:13.800 --> 55:19.520]  often these days can be a fatal flaw if I say that the world is round and
[55:19.520 --> 55:28.520]  someone else says it's flat that's worth reporting but you might also want to
[55:28.520 --> 55:33.400]  report on a bunch of scientific evidence that seems to support the notion that
[55:33.400 --> 55:38.440]  the world is round a job well done is about more than just handing someone a
[55:38.440 --> 55:42.280]  microphone it would be better served at billions of dollars in free media came
[55:42.280 --> 55:49.720]  with serious accountability especially when politicians you unworkable plans
[55:49.720 --> 55:54.240]  or make promises they can't keep and their reporters here who know they can't
[55:54.240 --> 56:01.920]  keep them saying you're you're a bunch of bad people because lecturing the
[56:01.920 --> 56:09.060]  media on he's sitting there lecturing the media as as as
[56:09.060 --> 56:16.040]  carburetor saying when the White House is one of the most deceptive and
[56:16.040 --> 56:21.840]  secretive in history and the media is a bunch of attack dogs after anybody not
[56:21.840 --> 56:27.480]  supporting Obama and he wants them to come out and attack people and say man
[56:27.480 --> 56:31.360]  made climate change is a fact when we have their internal emails admitting
[56:31.360 --> 56:37.000]  they know it's controlled by the Sun and they're trying to hide the decline and
[56:37.000 --> 56:41.200]  instead he has constant meetings daily when he's working and not on vacation
[56:41.200 --> 56:45.920]  with trendies from all these big movies and things like the hangover to make
[56:45.920 --> 56:50.440]  him look cool to the trendy population of millennials that don't even watch the
[56:50.440 --> 56:56.200]  news who do support him and Bernie Sanders and Hillary I mean it's like
[56:56.200 --> 57:02.080]  75% or more support socialist or liberal causes but it's not even socialist or
[57:02.080 --> 57:07.920]  liberal top 20 corporations going into Cuba to exploit the labor like
[57:07.920 --> 57:11.920]  slavery and the Rolling Stones coming in to get paid millions of dollars to
[57:11.920 --> 57:17.720]  share the profit with the Castro brothers is a scam is slavery China
[57:17.720 --> 57:23.880]  murdering Buddhists who are peaceful and taking their organs is wrong I know in
[57:23.880 --> 57:27.040]  the fantasy land bubble of the universities where you're going to
[57:27.040 --> 57:31.960]  school to get a career that already doesn't exist you've already been chumped
[57:31.960 --> 57:35.480]  and they know you're gonna want something free once you can't get a job when
[57:35.480 --> 57:40.520]  you get out in a couple years so they're preparing you to be a socialist army
[57:40.520 --> 57:44.920]  soldier basically to run around as a social justice warrior to riot and
[57:44.920 --> 57:53.760]  demonstrate and henpeck until everyone sits there and submits to you a bunch
[57:53.760 --> 57:58.960]  of entitled lazy soft I mean I'm not trying to be mean I don't care what
[57:58.960 --> 58:04.560]  color they are black white Asian Hispanic you go to any major university
[58:04.560 --> 58:08.360]  the people looked like they've had lobotomies and like they can hardly walk
[58:08.360 --> 58:13.600]  and they're looking at iPhones stumbling around and you talk to them we
[58:13.600 --> 58:20.280]  do the man on the street interviews they are they are just gone they are gone
[58:20.280 --> 58:26.800]  gone gone gone and it's the army of darkness a brain damaged zombie force
[58:26.800 --> 58:31.840]  bred by television now rising and the government and the elites are going to
[58:31.840 --> 58:35.560]  use them like an army of piranhas to eat us to the bone I mean we are in
[58:35.560 --> 58:40.440]  trouble these are the enemy soldiers the zombie force and don't laugh at them
[58:40.440 --> 58:46.680]  because there's a bunch of them zombies are powerful in the first decade of my
[58:46.680 --> 58:51.600]  battle against the globalist I gained close to 100 pounds now in the last

[58:56.100 --> 59:01.040]  plus pounds of that weight and as many viewers have noted the weight loss has
[59:01.040 --> 59:05.920]  accelerated in the last year the big turning point was when I did my first
[59:05.920 --> 59:09.480]  liver cleanse my friends I have gotten a lot of dramatic results with the
[59:09.480 --> 59:13.680]  incredible products in infowarslife.com but the most dramatic hands down and

[59:43.080 --> 59:45.640]  changing
[59:46.680 --> 59:52.240]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[59:57.000 --> 1:00:01.960]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the
[1:00:01.960 --> 1:00:09.440]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:00:09.440 --> 1:00:19.120]  coming up in the next segment Kent Terry brother of Ryan Terry he's going to be
[1:00:19.120 --> 1:00:27.080]  joining us with an investigator getting into what really happened with fast and
[1:00:27.080 --> 1:00:32.000]  furious you do not want to miss that information
[1:00:35.200 --> 1:00:38.120]  because there's been a lot of new developments that the media is not
[1:00:38.120 --> 1:00:40.760]  really covering that you need to know about it just illustrates the exact
[1:00:40.760 --> 1:00:44.040]  type of criminal activity we're dealing with the investigators going to break
[1:00:44.040 --> 1:00:49.520]  down the fact that the guns are still being shipped down by the ATF and the
[1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:55.160]  Obama Clintonistas and the fact that Congress isn't really even looking at
[1:00:55.160 --> 1:00:59.960]  this anymore just shows you how controlled they are and of course it ties
[1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:04.800]  into blaming the second amendment as well so that's coming up I just played
[1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:09.920]  the amazing clip of Obama lecturing the media that even Joe Scarborough had to
[1:01:09.920 --> 1:01:15.560]  say was ridiculous and the media is so servile and this thing about well we
[1:01:15.560 --> 1:01:18.320]  know the reality of somebody says the world's flat we know it's round the
[1:01:18.320 --> 1:01:22.000]  media needs to counter that speaking of man-made climate change and you know
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:26.400]  you need to go after these politicians on their lies on the lies I mean it's
[1:01:26.400 --> 1:01:31.160]  just amazing how they keep trying to arbitrate reality but I want to go to
[1:01:31.160 --> 1:01:35.360]  this other one and you can just type in for yourself everybody knows this Hillary
[1:01:35.360 --> 1:01:40.880]  is the number one recipient of top mega bank Wall Street money more than
[1:01:40.880 --> 1:01:46.840]  everybody else combined and she's the biggest overall pack receiver over any
[1:01:46.840 --> 1:01:51.080]  other candidate both parties just it's I showed a bunch of articles on screen
[1:01:51.080 --> 1:01:53.960]  and covered it last hour and mentioned it but let's go to the clip of her this
[1:01:53.960 --> 1:01:59.880]  is like Adolf Hitler of you to made it to Nuremberg in trial and when we got up
[1:01:59.880 --> 1:02:05.280]  and said we need to take action against Nazis and against Adolf Hitler and I
[1:02:05.280 --> 1:02:09.240]  hate Adolf Hitler and have never met him and don't know him and Adolf Hitler
[1:02:09.240 --> 1:02:14.920]  standing there I mean this is that dumb this is two plus two equals ten this is
[1:02:14.920 --> 1:02:19.360]  you didn't build your business this is purposely psych warfare to screw you up
[1:02:19.360 --> 1:02:23.400]  and get you to accept your lies let's play the Hillary Clinton complaints about
[1:02:23.400 --> 1:02:30.960]  super PACs big money in politics in 2014 the top 100 donors to super PACs spent
[1:02:30.960 --> 1:02:40.440]  nearly as much as all 4,750,000 small donors in the country combined now the
[1:02:40.440 --> 1:02:47.680]  idea I believe that money is speech turns our Constitution upside down wealth
[1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:52.440]  should not be privileged in the courts in fact it should have no privilege
[1:02:52.440 --> 1:02:57.880]  yet at a time when inequality between working Americans and those at the top
[1:02:57.880 --> 1:03:03.800]  is starker than ever the Supreme Court has given the wealthiest Americans even
[1:03:03.800 --> 1:03:10.920]  greater power to affect what happens in our democracy just as Ginsburg says if
[1:03:10.920 --> 1:03:16.000]  there were one recent decision she'd overrule it's this one all right let's
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:20.600]  stop right there the big mega banks that own the media can put out whatever
[1:03:20.600 --> 1:03:23.960]  propaganda they want and they don't call it political speech or political
[1:03:23.960 --> 1:03:29.080]  contributions and and the big money's putting its money right now universally
[1:03:29.080 --> 1:03:33.880]  against Trump like 90% of money being spent against him 20 something million
[1:03:33.880 --> 1:03:37.840]  per average state I mean it's never been done before and it's not working so the
[1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:44.720]  Koch brothers and the Soros money isn't working now but they're always gonna
[1:03:44.720 --> 1:03:47.320]  have the media they're always gonna have their propaganda and just not call it
[1:03:47.320 --> 1:03:50.560]  political speech they want to restrict everybody else's speech like the next
[1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:55.280]  issues are mine I mean I gave one time three thousand dollars the maximum
[1:03:55.280 --> 1:04:02.440]  amount of Ron Paul and they made a big scandal out of that because I clicked to
[1:04:02.440 --> 1:04:07.520]  give it and the computer messed up and then I clicked again and then two went
[1:04:07.520 --> 1:04:11.960]  through so I deleted it on the credit card or on the debit card and sent them
[1:04:11.960 --> 1:04:15.280]  an email they deleted it out to but it showed it as a record and there was a
[1:04:15.280 --> 1:04:19.880]  criminal investigation reporter to start it in a Mr. Jones and he's you know
[1:04:19.880 --> 1:04:24.720]  $6,000 or whatever it was double the amount to of course I could have been
[1:04:24.720 --> 1:04:28.200]  my wife giving it had been okay but what point is I hardly give any political
[1:04:28.200 --> 1:04:31.960]  money and I'm not a political you know just like Dinesh the Susan got his
[1:04:31.960 --> 1:04:36.000]  friends to do an unofficial pack and give some money to his friend run for
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:39.240]  Senate he spent nine months in prison folks but Hillary could take money from
[1:04:39.240 --> 1:04:43.640]  foreign dictators into her foundation and use it in elections I mean she's the
[1:04:43.640 --> 1:04:47.440]  worst of anybody really in history but she's up there and she wants to stop it
[1:04:47.440 --> 1:04:52.200]  no they want to selectively just like the IRS does the 501c3 go after
[1:04:52.200 --> 1:04:57.480]  anybody that isn't left a mouse at home the high life expectancy enjoyed in
[1:04:57.480 --> 1:05:02.240]  Japan is largely due to the nation's healthy diet reports the independent the
[1:05:02.240 --> 1:05:06.640]  population of the island nation which has one of the lowest mortality rates in
[1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:11.440]  the world each diet's high in certain carbohydrates vegetables fruits as well
[1:05:11.440 --> 1:05:17.080]  as fish and meat such foods make for a diet low in saturated fats researchers
[1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:21.880]  at the National Center for Global Health and Medicine in Tokyo investigated
[1:05:21.880 --> 1:05:25.800]  how following a certain food guide affected the country's mortality rate
[1:05:25.800 --> 1:05:31.000]  the team analyzed food and lifestyle questionnaires completed by 36,000 men
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:37.200]  and 42,000 women aged between 45 and 75 who had no history of cancer stroke
[1:05:37.200 --> 1:05:41.680]  heart or chronic liver disease participants were tracked for 15 years
[1:05:41.680 --> 1:05:45.920]  researchers found that participants who closely followed the food guide had a
[1:05:45.920 --> 1:05:54.000]  15% lower mortality rate you can find more reports on info wars.com

[1:08:22.920 --> 1:08:26.200]  gentlemen thank you so much for joining us we are now into the second hour of the
[1:08:26.200 --> 1:08:30.480]  worldwide broadcast and for the next 30 minutes or so we're gonna be covering an
[1:08:30.480 --> 1:08:36.400]  incredibly important topic to the future of this country and freedom I mean it is
[1:08:36.400 --> 1:08:40.800]  so big following this case and many of you have followed it out there there's
[1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:46.440]  so many angles and pieces to it it is simply amazing but the first thing I
[1:08:46.440 --> 1:08:52.000]  just want to say here is we had the famous CBS reporter Cheryl Atkinson
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:59.240]  basically run out of CBS because she did her job and exposed that document
[1:08:59.240 --> 1:09:05.440]  showed the ATF used fast and furious to make the case for gun regulations now
[1:09:05.440 --> 1:09:10.560]  El Chapo has been found with 50 caliber rifles you name it and the big news today
[1:09:10.560 --> 1:09:17.480]  is there's evidence that more guns are still being shipped down to Mexico we
[1:09:17.480 --> 1:09:23.440]  should see impeachment over this shouldn't we but we have not seen
[1:09:23.440 --> 1:09:31.440]  impeachment over this now we're gonna go to Kent Terry brother of the fallen
[1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:38.000]  board patrol agent Brian Terry first then we're gonna go to an investigator
[1:09:38.760 --> 1:09:46.080]  Matt Smith Mac who is a retired USMC Lieutenant Colonel and an
[1:09:46.080 --> 1:09:49.120]  investigator and has the background to be doing it who's working with the
[1:09:49.120 --> 1:09:53.120]  family the board patrol and others to bring out exactly what's happening in
[1:09:53.120 --> 1:09:57.440]  the ongoing crimes so this is a big investigative report today in the time
[1:09:57.440 --> 1:10:03.360]  we have I appreciate both men joining us Kent Terry brother of Brian Terry who
[1:10:03.360 --> 1:10:09.120]  died in 2010 will be on first to break down the basics of what happened for
[1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:12.280]  those that may not know and then what's developed since them but reading over all
[1:10:12.280 --> 1:10:17.680]  this you guys sent me the fact that he had documents handwritten notes in his
[1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:21.120]  boots hidden the fact that the feds came in and took all his materials the fact
[1:10:21.120 --> 1:10:25.320]  that he was warning family that he got into some serious investigations you
[1:10:25.320 --> 1:10:28.840]  know is it more than just some illegal alien drug dealer that shot and killed
[1:10:28.840 --> 1:10:32.720]  your brother this thing looks like an even bigger cover up to me and I know
[1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:36.760]  that's the direction this is going we're gonna break it all down Kent Terry
[1:10:36.760 --> 1:10:40.360]  thank you so much for coming on with us today thank you mr. Jones
[1:10:40.360 --> 1:10:47.240]  appreciate it where should we start well everybody knows that the blind was
[1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:54.440]  killed fast and furious scandal by the Obama administration but the thing is
[1:10:54.440 --> 1:11:01.440]  though the lies that my family has been told from day one since day one they
[1:11:01.440 --> 1:11:06.360]  told us they found three weapons and they apprehended four suspects then within
[1:11:06.360 --> 1:11:11.200]  12 hours later they only found two weapons and they had to release the
[1:11:11.200 --> 1:11:18.480]  suspect and but we never knew about fast and furious until Cheryl Acton reached
[1:11:18.480 --> 1:11:23.840]  the story release the story with John Dodson but in the meantime prior to
[1:11:23.840 --> 1:11:29.520]  meeting with Cheryl Acton then and the John Dodson release Dennis Burke which
[1:11:29.520 --> 1:11:35.560]  was the attorney general state attorney for Arizona that was involved in fast
[1:11:35.560 --> 1:11:40.720]  and furious made appearance to our house making sure that the weapons that
[1:11:40.720 --> 1:11:44.440]  Brian's team were not from Arizona they're from a store in Texas and we're
[1:11:44.440 --> 1:11:48.000]  thinking this is something to write with this whole thing so when Cheryl acts
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:52.360]  among that story out right there we knew that this was a lie and a big cover
[1:11:52.360 --> 1:11:59.280]  up and Brian's death and now you guys have done an intense investigation with
[1:11:59.280 --> 1:12:05.440]  Matt Smith Mac and others and I just this is pretty bombshell I know he's
[1:12:05.440 --> 1:12:10.480]  gonna talk about the direction it's pointing but in your gut looking at
[1:12:10.480 --> 1:12:14.080]  this and the way they've changed the story so much and the fact that he had
[1:12:14.080 --> 1:12:18.200]  documents we're gonna be showing to the TV part of the audience you know
[1:12:18.200 --> 1:12:22.040]  basically hidden so they would get to other people if something happened to
[1:12:22.040 --> 1:12:26.040]  him I mean this this sounds like an action adventure who done it movie to me
[1:12:26.040 --> 1:12:30.120]  we know what Mr. Jones from day one I knew something wasn't right I mean
[1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:34.040]  especially told my mom two months before he got killed that you know mom I don't
[1:12:34.040 --> 1:12:37.520]  want to go back something just doesn't feel right I can't talk to talk about it
[1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:41.440]  my mom was like Brian you know what if you don't want to go don't go back
[1:12:41.440 --> 1:12:47.480]  because well you know I love my job I love this country and a year later when
[1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:52.160]  I was going through his materials and his belongings I would go try on these
[1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:56.520]  pair of boots and I thought it was a paper from the brand new pair of boots
[1:12:56.520 --> 1:13:00.320]  and I pulled out that journal I started going through it and I'm like about him
[1:13:00.320 --> 1:13:06.160]  intercepting pulling over people with price pulls a k-47s and you know he had
[1:13:06.160 --> 1:13:09.680]  the GPS coordinates down there and everything was told by a supervisor to
[1:13:09.680 --> 1:13:14.960]  let go right there I knew you know what the whole time your Brian steps did not
[1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:19.280]  add up 15 minutes before he got off the email if you wrote to the board of
[1:13:19.280 --> 1:13:24.800]  patrol union regarding a situation going on in the border and the border patrol
[1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:28.040]  union told us it wasn't about a transfer and it wasn't about a time off the lift
[1:13:28.040 --> 1:13:33.440]  into it so I think Brian was on your fast and serious I don't think you knew
[1:13:33.440 --> 1:13:39.200]  the extent of it I don't think you knew how big it really was but in my gut the
[1:13:39.200 --> 1:13:43.400]  timing of Brian's death is not not add up to what the government's telling what
[1:13:43.400 --> 1:13:50.040]  was it like for you after December 2010 to then a year later December 7th 2011
[1:13:50.040 --> 1:13:55.720]  almost a year to the date CBS coming out and a valiant reporter documenting
[1:13:55.720 --> 1:13:59.680]  that this this was a stage deal to blame the Second Amendment and to blame
[1:13:59.680 --> 1:14:03.520]  American gun owners for violence in Mexico and what was it like when you saw
[1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:09.840]  news like that I was sick I was actually sick to my stomach I'm like you know what
[1:14:09.840 --> 1:14:14.400]  this this is what they're gonna do to our own people here and this is a me was
[1:14:14.400 --> 1:14:17.280]  there a whole thing about changing the Second Amendment showing there was a gun
[1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:20.720]  problem for the United States I think that was her whole ideal what was going
[1:14:20.720 --> 1:14:26.000]  on but that just made me sick about how they're blaming something else and it
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:29.120]  it's just I feel like I'm in a nightmare and I still feel like I'm in a
[1:14:29.120 --> 1:14:33.280]  nightmare now you I know you got to go in about ten minutes so I'm gonna skip
[1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:35.720]  this network break coming up because it's so important we're talking to Kent
[1:14:35.720 --> 1:14:40.040]  Terry brother of slain hero Brian Terry who tried to stand up and tell the
[1:14:40.040 --> 1:14:44.200]  truth and was clearly basically taken out or hit for it
[1:14:44.200 --> 1:14:48.000]  you're very very sad but thank God he's got a great family and thank God this
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:51.840]  information ended up getting out and there's patriots like Matt Smith mech
[1:14:51.840 --> 1:14:55.880]  out there and I know he works with you and the family as a tireless
[1:14:55.880 --> 1:14:59.400]  investigator want to bring him in jumping anytime you want Kent with points
[1:14:59.400 --> 1:15:03.840]  you want to make 20 year veteran of the US Marine Corps EA 6b electronic
[1:15:03.840 --> 1:15:08.720]  countermeasures officer attaining rank of Lieutenant Colonel before March 2006
[1:15:08.720 --> 1:15:13.080]  veteran of Desert Shield Storm Bosnia campaign operation during freedom I'm
[1:15:13.080 --> 1:15:17.200]  not going to go over this whole bio would take about an hour to do that all
[1:15:17.200 --> 1:15:20.080]  places even stations what he's been involved in I'd imagine all this
[1:15:20.080 --> 1:15:24.800]  background working with FBI CIA DA you name it gives him a background no he
[1:15:24.800 --> 1:15:30.240]  sees when he sees it amazing info how best to break down where your
[1:15:30.240 --> 1:15:33.720]  investigation is going because I see in your notes here you sent me that there's
[1:15:33.720 --> 1:15:40.120]  more shipments it's ongoing that is bombshell because wow Congress isn't
[1:15:40.120 --> 1:15:44.680]  really doing anything and if this comes back out this could really really
[1:15:44.680 --> 1:15:50.400]  hopefully stop this activity sir yeah mr. Jones I good afternoon yeah I think
[1:15:50.400 --> 1:15:55.920]  you're right it it certainly would and self-telling on what the Brian just said
[1:15:55.920 --> 1:16:01.600]  you know we've been helping and working with the Terry family and I think what
[1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:08.000]  is important is building off of what of what Brian said you still have there is
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:15.200]  a central figure that is since 2012 has been trying to help law enforcement
[1:16:15.200 --> 1:16:21.440]  house oversight and senator Grassley's office and interestingly all that there's
[1:16:21.440 --> 1:16:27.320]  been a lot of action but no no vector no direction and also interestingly a
[1:16:27.320 --> 1:16:31.560]  friend of this program as you know a Tosh Plumlee and I both from
[1:16:31.560 --> 1:16:37.320]  congressional offices were admonished to stop talking to the Terry family because
[1:16:37.320 --> 1:16:42.160]  it was told it was worrisome and unwarranted and when I talked to Kent
[1:16:42.160 --> 1:16:45.400]  you know Kent said hey we've never talked to those folks we never talked
[1:16:45.400 --> 1:16:48.960]  to anybody in Congress we haven't we haven't said anything about you guys but
[1:16:48.960 --> 1:16:52.280]  I find that bizarre and I have actually an email from one of the people telling
[1:16:52.280 --> 1:16:57.400]  me to essentially back off so we found that very striking and I think
[1:16:57.400 --> 1:17:06.200]  importantly to what what Brian was on to we have beginning of late last year let
[1:17:06.200 --> 1:17:11.400]  ATF both in Tucson and the Chicago offices know that weapons were still
[1:17:11.400 --> 1:17:14.800]  going across the border we're going to go across in early November matter of
[1:17:14.800 --> 1:17:18.680]  fact they want to cross on 10 November the Marine Corps birthday of all days
[1:17:18.680 --> 1:17:24.000]  nothing was done to stop it they only met with the central character three days
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:29.720]  after the fact and again we've also alerted some folks in the congressional
[1:17:29.720 --> 1:17:33.840]  side because you know talking to a lot of the folks who were lost their jobs or
[1:17:33.840 --> 1:17:37.320]  retired or gotten trouble over trying to tell the truth I'm fast and furious you
[1:17:37.320 --> 1:17:42.160]  know we're told do not trust ATF leadership do not trust DOJ OYG so
[1:17:42.160 --> 1:17:45.880]  ergo we're trying to work with Congress House oversight Senator Grassley's
[1:17:45.880 --> 1:17:50.680]  office of late sir actually Congress and Trey Gowdy who I've received an email
[1:17:50.680 --> 1:17:54.600]  from who asked me to certainly forward him everything you know always forward
[1:17:54.600 --> 1:17:58.920]  to him what I've got so I've been doing that but again we've got a mid-May of
[1:17:58.920 --> 1:18:03.160]  this year time frame where another large shipment is scheduled to go across
[1:18:03.160 --> 1:18:09.280]  from basically Arizona into Mexico and we're trying to have trying to make
[1:18:09.280 --> 1:18:14.840]  sure that does not occur and the folks who were involved with this actually
[1:18:14.840 --> 1:18:21.880]  have agreed to meet with Kent this other central figure and and they actually an
[1:18:21.880 --> 1:18:26.520]  investigative reporter for a major cable news network to recount everything I
[1:18:26.520 --> 1:18:31.360]  mean they they have locations they have names they have as John Dodson had talked
[1:18:31.360 --> 1:18:35.200]  to me about get evidence to lay hands on and and hopefully sir you know mid-May
[1:18:35.200 --> 1:18:40.680]  this this could come to fruition this is huge because looking at your bio
[1:18:40.680 --> 1:18:45.680]  running major basis chief of staff tribunal member chief of staff naval
[1:18:45.680 --> 1:18:48.840]  base Guantanamo Bay for office of the administrative review of detention of
[1:18:48.840 --> 1:18:52.440]  enemy combatants just going over your bio you know you've worked at every level
[1:18:52.440 --> 1:18:56.040]  intelligence you name it as an expert I mean we can say you're an expert expert
[1:18:56.040 --> 1:18:59.840]  you're an expert consultant currently what does this look like to you I mean we
[1:18:59.840 --> 1:19:02.960]  know they were doing it to blame the Second Amendment was there more why does
[1:19:02.960 --> 1:19:06.920]  El Chapo have all these fast and furious guns why does the media try to cover it
[1:19:06.920 --> 1:19:10.280]  up I mean what's what's the big picture I know you don't like to speculate but you
[1:19:10.280 --> 1:19:14.000]  know we're five six years into this now we have a lot of pieces here what do you
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:19.920]  think's going on sir what what what I would speculate is both telling on what
[1:19:19.920 --> 1:19:23.920]  the Tosh Plumlee has been on your program before and talked about this is a
[1:19:23.920 --> 1:19:28.600]  much I think part of a much larger international gun running operation as
[1:19:28.600 --> 1:19:34.480]  a matter of fact a person in Congress had asked me to ask this central character
[1:19:34.480 --> 1:19:39.760]  this integral figure that still is trying to help the Terry family
[1:19:39.760 --> 1:19:47.480]  congressional oversight that you have a nexus between fast and furious and if
[1:19:47.480 --> 1:19:52.760]  not Benghazi at least the Middle East we know from accounts from the folks were
[1:19:52.760 --> 1:19:58.480]  actually involved with running these weapons in September of 2010 weapons
[1:19:58.480 --> 1:20:04.920]  separate from what we call fast and furious were run down to Mexico down to
[1:20:04.920 --> 1:20:09.800]  a town of Mexico a caborca actually met with the International Middle Eastern
[1:20:09.800 --> 1:20:14.760]  Arms dealer and en route over to the Middle East this happened at least three
[1:20:14.760 --> 1:20:20.600]  times again starting at September 2010 and of I think of great import is a
[1:20:20.600 --> 1:20:26.720]  Moroccan DST commander their DST of their internal security forces on 16
[1:20:26.720 --> 1:20:33.920]  October 2010 reported to his supervisors that fast and furious weapons were in
[1:20:33.920 --> 1:20:38.400]  the kingdom of Morocco en route to arm the rebels in Algeria so here we have
[1:20:38.400 --> 1:20:43.680]  an alan nexus from weapons going across the southern border wow in the
[1:20:43.680 --> 1:20:48.600]  Mexico and then from there going out to God knows where wow and I know some of
[1:20:48.600 --> 1:20:51.960]  the NATO sources to Plumlee and others have said that and then so much what
[1:20:51.960 --> 1:20:55.840]  Plumlee said three four years ago has come out and been exactly true we now
[1:20:55.840 --> 1:20:59.560]  have so many of the heroes that survived who were on the ground who got the sat
[1:20:59.560 --> 1:21:02.920]  phone calls from the State Department from you know orders that know the
[1:21:02.920 --> 1:21:07.480]  secretary says stand down and we have them now on Fox News basically exposing
[1:21:07.480 --> 1:21:12.440]  what what Hillary's done and we know that there's a conduit basically fencing
[1:21:12.440 --> 1:21:17.480]  the guns through Mexico and then out to the Middle East simply amazing and then
[1:21:17.480 --> 1:21:23.240]  you're breaking down intel of all your sources that it's still going on that is
[1:21:23.240 --> 1:21:26.360]  mind-blowing I mean I know you're here talking about I don't know bright bars
[1:21:26.360 --> 1:21:30.880]  reported on some of this what can we do as investigative journalists out there
[1:21:30.880 --> 1:21:35.800]  listening myself included you to draw more attention to this I mean what's
[1:21:35.800 --> 1:21:39.440]  what's the bottom line narrative and because this just sounds like outrageous
[1:21:39.440 --> 1:21:42.800]  tyranny it's not just going to drug cartels now it's going to ISIS and
[1:21:42.800 --> 1:21:47.040]  al-Qaeda stinger missiles out of Benghazi we know that now and when I was told
[1:21:47.040 --> 1:21:50.080]  that by colonel Schaefer three four years ago I couldn't believe it I mean he
[1:21:50.080 --> 1:21:52.760]  got in trouble for saying it on air it's been turned out to be true I mean I
[1:21:52.760 --> 1:21:55.480]  believed him was just unbelievable and then now we got it from all these other
[1:21:55.480 --> 1:22:02.040]  sources I mean the military knows about it how do they get away with this
[1:22:02.040 --> 1:22:07.000]  voice sir you know it's you know as Lenin said any lie told you know any lie
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:10.360]  told big enough or off enough is is believable I think people are hoping
[1:22:10.360 --> 1:22:13.880]  the American people just forget about it you know we have a short a short
[1:22:13.880 --> 1:22:18.480]  attention span unfortunately but but for me it's it's it's very personal and
[1:22:18.480 --> 1:22:23.120]  that you know Brian besides being a border patrol agent was also a former
[1:22:23.120 --> 1:22:26.920]  Marine I'm a former Marine we do not let Marines stay on the battlefield
[1:22:26.920 --> 1:22:30.240]  whether it's their body or the reputation or their soul so for me it's
[1:22:30.240 --> 1:22:34.680]  personal and what I would say sir you know we have made contact with Tristan
[1:22:34.680 --> 1:22:39.920]  Levitt that house oversight with Jason Foster and Senator Grassley's office and
[1:22:39.920 --> 1:22:43.800]  unfortunately you know and I'd like to have you know certainly Kent come back in
[1:22:43.800 --> 1:22:48.440]  here those folks the Terry family Kent in particular not even you know getting
[1:22:48.440 --> 1:22:51.760]  the courtesy of return phone call amazing stay right there you make a good
[1:22:51.760 --> 1:22:54.680]  point you can stay longer but I can't Terry brother Brown Terry's got to go in
[1:22:54.680 --> 1:22:58.200]  about five minutes so you've heard the powerful points that Matt's made here
[1:22:58.200 --> 1:23:03.400]  Colonel has made what can you add to this what else would you like to impart to
[1:23:03.400 --> 1:23:09.000]  folks about your brother sir you know I give Brian the honor who deserves I
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:13.720]  mean don't don't shrug them off throw them under the rug like in some piece of
[1:23:13.720 --> 1:23:16.520]  dirt and that's what this country is doing just not the country just you know
[1:23:16.520 --> 1:23:21.480]  the Congress and senators promise my family dust accountability even Elijah
[1:23:21.480 --> 1:23:25.800]  come and promise my mom and guess what nothing nothing has happened they don't
[1:23:25.800 --> 1:23:29.160]  keep in contact with us they don't tell us nothing it's always every time they
[1:23:29.160 --> 1:23:33.320]  do call us do you want to know what we know and it's like I'm getting sick of
[1:23:33.320 --> 1:23:37.320]  it I mean like I said my brother's served 20 years of this country over 20
[1:23:37.320 --> 1:23:41.520]  years and this is what he gets return well he was doing his job too good and
[1:23:41.520 --> 1:23:45.480]  that's obvious and he is a hero and he helped unravel so much of this so at
[1:23:45.480 --> 1:23:49.440]  least the public knows but you're right he's like the string that'll unravel the
[1:23:49.440 --> 1:23:53.680]  whole sweater that's why they want to shut down but thank God good ATF agents
[1:23:53.680 --> 1:23:56.520]  and others and and you know people like yourself and your family have
[1:23:56.520 --> 1:24:01.960]  encouraged and Lieutenant Colonel Smith mech and others the court of public
[1:24:01.960 --> 1:24:05.840]  opinion people pretty much know what happened but to me it's so amazing that
[1:24:05.840 --> 1:24:11.400]  it's ongoing I mean if we just let your brother hang out there and don't stand
[1:24:11.400 --> 1:24:15.200]  up for him we're all in danger and I wish some of the public out there got
[1:24:15.200 --> 1:24:19.040]  how important this is if they can get away with crimes of this magnitude can't
[1:24:19.040 --> 1:24:23.560]  we're all in trouble do you agree with that yeah and another thing is to with
[1:24:23.560 --> 1:24:26.880]  all these ISIS threats and all these ISIS coming to the border what makes you
[1:24:26.880 --> 1:24:29.600]  think they're not going to grab these weapons that are down in Mexico and use
[1:24:29.600 --> 1:24:32.920]  them on a you know a terrorist act here or another school shooting or a
[1:24:32.920 --> 1:24:36.960]  multiple shooting you know I'm actually here thousands a month of other than
[1:24:36.960 --> 1:24:40.880]  Mexicans from the Middle East you name it pouring across I want to ask what's
[1:24:40.880 --> 1:24:44.160]  in it Colonel Smith mech about that I mean we saw the head of South com just
[1:24:44.160 --> 1:24:48.240]  two years ago come out and say we got a big problem in South America Central
[1:24:48.240 --> 1:24:52.400]  America the Caribbean we are having groups affiliated with Al Qaeda and ISIS
[1:24:52.400 --> 1:24:56.360]  coming in that's now admitted they're saying at least 400 sleeper cell
[1:24:56.360 --> 1:24:59.880]  operatives in Europe have come in ISIS said that a year ago they were going to
[1:24:59.880 --> 1:25:04.840]  do it what's your information on that Colonel
[1:25:06.400 --> 1:25:12.520]  Jones and also again the other another investigative journalist on a major
[1:25:12.520 --> 1:25:15.760]  cable news network kind of indicated the same thing sure I apologize your first
[1:25:15.760 --> 1:25:19.880]  audio was caught off you start over oh I would say I agree with you mr. Jones and
[1:25:19.880 --> 1:25:24.040]  your points and importantly I think another investigative journalist from a
[1:25:24.040 --> 1:25:28.040]  major cable news network is this information leads to the same kind of
[1:25:28.040 --> 1:25:32.200]  conclusions and of note you know when you go down to that border and you you
[1:25:32.200 --> 1:25:36.360]  talk to the folks who live on there every day which will hear is not that
[1:25:36.360 --> 1:25:40.640]  things happen with knowledge and permission of our government things
[1:25:40.640 --> 1:25:45.480]  only happen down there with knowledge and permission of the cartel yes sir
[1:25:45.480 --> 1:25:47.880]  well you're gonna be with us another five ten minutes I appreciate your time
[1:25:47.880 --> 1:25:53.920]  Lieutenant Colonel let's go back to mr. Terry's brother Kent any other points
[1:25:53.920 --> 1:25:58.360]  you'd like folks to know any websites so any places people can go to learn more
[1:25:58.360 --> 1:26:05.440]  or get involved what can we do yeah my family started a foundation Brian Terry
[1:26:05.440 --> 1:26:09.840]  Foundation honor Brian Terry dot com and we post all the stuff that's going on
[1:26:09.840 --> 1:26:14.000]  with the trials and who's been convicted so far that's another thing too it's
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:19.800]  like these people out there that they convicted for supposedly Brian's killing
[1:26:19.800 --> 1:26:25.800]  there out of six guys or when they got apprehended we're waiting on one more
[1:26:25.800 --> 1:26:29.520]  thing from Mexico and supposing you know these other shooters so it makes me kind
[1:26:29.520 --> 1:26:33.000]  of think that there's another shooter involved but yeah honor Brian Terry dot
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:38.040]  com we pretty much put all updates on there about what's going on with the
[1:26:38.040 --> 1:26:42.880]  foundation and with Brian's trial and accountability so and I appreciate
[1:26:42.880 --> 1:26:49.160]  everybody that supports the injustice from our brother well it's a great site
[1:26:49.160 --> 1:26:52.160]  people should go to it right now and they should support you they should
[1:26:52.160 --> 1:26:55.560]  spread the word and you know that they may ignore the people they may ignore
[1:26:55.560 --> 1:26:59.240]  your brother but the establishments in deep trouble the mainstream media is
[1:26:59.240 --> 1:27:03.680]  collapsing because they won't do their job it is despicable and thank you so
[1:27:03.680 --> 1:27:07.120]  much I can't Terry for your time God bless you all right no thank you Mr.
[1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:11.480]  Donce appreciate it thank you going back to Lieutenant Colonel Matt Smith Max
[1:27:11.480 --> 1:27:15.800]  sir you're the expert on this but I mean I just look at it it's so crazy what
[1:27:15.800 --> 1:27:19.640]  else can you tell the public what other tidbits are most important and then
[1:27:19.640 --> 1:27:23.320]  separately even you a few more minutes after the break just to get into general
[1:27:23.320 --> 1:27:27.320]  terrorism what is the establishment gonna do when they bring in millions of
[1:27:27.320 --> 1:27:30.680]  people to Europe hundreds of thousands here don't even check their IDs on
[1:27:30.680 --> 1:27:34.000]  purpose because they know they've got backgrounds what are they gonna do let's
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:36.840]  cover that now what are they gonna do when they attack they've already attacked
[1:27:36.840 --> 1:27:39.720]  San Bernardino they're already attacking all over they're already attacking
[1:27:39.720 --> 1:27:42.760]  Army Navy Marine Corps recruiting centers there they already attacked Fort Hood
[1:27:42.760 --> 1:27:46.200]  wouldn't call it terrorism what's gonna happen when it really gets bad what are
[1:27:46.200 --> 1:27:48.640]  these politicians thinking how do they think they're gonna get away with it
[1:27:48.640 --> 1:27:53.000]  well maybe the answer is they got away with fast and furious you know you know
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:56.920]  sir I I tend to agree what you just said you maybe they'll get away with it I
[1:27:56.920 --> 1:28:01.560]  honest the goodness think that they believe the American public has a short
[1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:06.720]  attention span that we don't care and we're this is likely to forget it and
[1:28:06.720 --> 1:28:11.440]  worry about our the next episode of the Kardashians or the Americans or our
[1:28:11.440 --> 1:28:17.320]  next iPhone and and not something that is that is critical to this country is
[1:28:17.320 --> 1:28:20.360]  as I was talking to you when you producers before I said you know if we
[1:28:20.360 --> 1:28:26.680]  if we whether it's this Benghazi the IRS if we as citizens allow this to happen
[1:28:26.680 --> 1:28:31.200]  and don't speak up and make and make our protestations known then we are merely
[1:28:31.200 --> 1:28:35.840]  subjects and not citizens and that's not what our country is about absolutely I
[1:28:35.840 --> 1:28:39.080]  mean I know inside the military and police this really woke him up fast and
[1:28:39.080 --> 1:28:44.320]  furious now it's really woke him up that it turned out NATO and Obama and the
[1:28:44.320 --> 1:28:47.880]  rest of them have been funding ISIS and you know al-Qaeda groups behind the
[1:28:47.880 --> 1:28:52.200]  scenes against Assad I mean it just seems like if that's going on what else is
[1:28:52.200 --> 1:28:56.320]  going on we don't know about I mean this is wild you know I say I tell you sir
[1:28:56.320 --> 1:29:02.400]  it's interesting just going back to fast and furious one of the things that we
[1:29:02.400 --> 1:29:06.680]  made sure we got to representative isa and house oversight end of September
[1:29:06.680 --> 1:29:13.400]  early October 2013 was material material sent to him that essentially said not
[1:29:13.400 --> 1:29:19.720]  only is it guns and rifles but also grenades grenade launchers military
[1:29:19.720 --> 1:29:24.600]  grade night vision goggles black special forces tactical uniforms and of them
[1:29:24.600 --> 1:29:28.320]  of importance there's gonna curl stay there do five more minutes with us this
[1:29:28.320 --> 1:29:31.320]  is so important back in three because I've even forgotten about all the night
[1:29:31.320 --> 1:29:36.840]  vision the hand grenades the rocket launchers all out of this is stuff
[1:29:36.840 --> 1:29:40.920]  you're getting a gun shows folks this is a big arms shipment and the White
[1:29:40.920 --> 1:29:44.880]  House is running it and then probably probably had you know who killed on the
[1:29:44.880 --> 1:29:55.800]  March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network the high
[1:29:55.800 --> 1:30:00.280]  life expectancy enjoyed in Japan is largely due to the nation's healthy
[1:30:00.280 --> 1:30:04.760]  diet reports the independent the population of the island nation which
[1:30:04.760 --> 1:30:07.480]  has one of the lowest mortality rates in the world
[1:30:07.480 --> 1:30:12.240]  eats diets high in certain carbohydrates vegetables fruits as well as fish and
[1:30:12.240 --> 1:30:17.760]  meat such foods make for a diet low in saturated fats researchers at the
[1:30:17.760 --> 1:30:22.200]  National Center for Global Health and Medicine in Tokyo investigated how
[1:30:22.200 --> 1:30:26.600]  following a certain food guide affected the country's mortality rate the team
[1:30:26.600 --> 1:30:30.960]  analyzed food and lifestyle questionnaires completed by 36,000
[1:30:30.960 --> 1:30:37.400]  men and 42,000 women aged between 45 and 75 who had no history of cancer stroke
[1:30:37.400 --> 1:30:41.440]  heart or chronic liver disease participants were tracked for 15
[1:30:41.440 --> 1:30:46.080]  years researchers found that participants who closely followed the food guide had
[1:30:46.080 --> 1:31:02.120]  a 15% lower mortality rate you can find more reports on info wars.com

[1:31:59.280 --> 1:32:03.280]  called the iodine conspiracy I've told you about how scientists have known for
[1:32:03.280 --> 1:32:07.480]  decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government
[1:32:07.480 --> 1:32:11.920]  knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride the bad
[1:32:11.920 --> 1:32:16.040]  member of the halogen family in the water they took the good halogen out and
[1:32:16.040 --> 1:32:20.480]  put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened as it still
[1:32:20.480 --> 1:32:24.160]  is worsening today I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your
[1:32:24.160 --> 1:32:29.640]  family now in 2016 even more information has been revealed concerning the
[1:32:29.640 --> 1:32:34.360]  connection between iodine and the gut which many experts are now saying could
[1:32:34.360 --> 1:32:38.400]  be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine you can pull these
[1:32:38.400 --> 1:32:42.320]  studies up for yourself this is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine
[1:32:42.320 --> 1:32:47.320]  is essential in my view to any optimum health regimen stock up on survival

[1:33:07.080 --> 1:33:14.720]  by the way lieutenant colonel math Smith Mac is the hero in his own right
[1:33:14.720 --> 1:33:18.640]  Texas go ahead and fade down the intro go ahead and bring me in you know I tell
[1:33:18.640 --> 1:33:24.680]  you it is just crazy to to to sit here and see this because there is so much
[1:33:24.680 --> 1:33:28.200]  corruption there's so much that comes out and more and more people don't get in
[1:33:28.200 --> 1:33:31.880]  trouble for it and believe me you get a lot of heat you get a lot of threats
[1:33:31.880 --> 1:33:36.000]  when you do stuff like this because I know we do and you know people call up
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:39.240]  saying you better back off you better stop these are dangerous folks we're
[1:33:39.240 --> 1:33:43.080]  dealing with but if we don't stand up to them we're gonna lose everything again
[1:33:43.080 --> 1:33:48.240]  Alex Jones here broadcasting live subjects like this get me so upset that
[1:33:48.240 --> 1:33:52.720]  I even forgot I had an intro coming in there because you sit back and you
[1:33:52.720 --> 1:33:56.760]  realize the people run our government are doing things like this and the sky
[1:33:56.760 --> 1:33:59.160]  is the limit and they're not even doing something dirty like in the Cold War
[1:33:59.160 --> 1:34:02.120]  against the Soviets or something I'd be against that because then you
[1:34:02.120 --> 1:34:08.080]  degenerate and it turns into something like this but to ship weapons into
[1:34:08.080 --> 1:34:13.280]  Mexico and then to ship them into the Middle East to then start a war and try
[1:34:13.280 --> 1:34:19.240]  to overthrow Syria try to overthrow Libya try to overthrow Egypt and none of
[1:34:19.240 --> 1:34:23.840]  those are perfectly run countries but compared to what we're putting in it's
[1:34:23.840 --> 1:34:28.360]  crazy and then to try to lie to the military and tell them we're not backing
[1:34:28.360 --> 1:34:34.160]  the jihadist out of Saudi Arabia that lie has come crashing down and that's the
[1:34:34.160 --> 1:34:38.320]  good news here individually people may not have gotten in trouble for fast and
[1:34:38.320 --> 1:34:45.400]  furious or Benghazi but basically everybody knows now and it really is
[1:34:45.400 --> 1:34:49.840]  crippling the ability of people like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama to
[1:34:49.840 --> 1:34:53.840]  continue to expand whatever it is they're doing because it's hard to figure
[1:34:53.840 --> 1:34:57.720]  out how it's for American interest to put a bunch al-Qaeda people and ISIS
[1:34:57.720 --> 1:35:02.320]  people in charge of countries it's it's it's very very dangerous and but the
[1:35:02.320 --> 1:35:06.360]  facts we know is they did this to blame the Second Amendments now sir I want to
[1:35:06.360 --> 1:35:11.880]  the next five minutes give you the floor again to break down other key points
[1:35:11.880 --> 1:35:16.640]  we're talking to recently retired Lieutenant Colonel Matt Smith Mack who
[1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:20.960]  has taken this case on I should also add they wrote a very powerful article
[1:35:20.960 --> 1:35:25.240]  that's not been published yet that was written for a major newspaper I don't
[1:35:25.240 --> 1:35:28.120]  know if I'm allowed to say who you can talk about if he wants to and that they
[1:35:28.120 --> 1:35:32.400]  said they would run it but then they didn't run it and and and not because of
[1:35:32.400 --> 1:35:36.120]  the information you know not being true because they have quote cold feet we're
[1:35:36.120 --> 1:35:42.160]  going to publish this today at info wars.com so that everybody can see it
[1:35:42.160 --> 1:35:45.360]  who knows drugs might link to it I don't control what he links to but this is
[1:35:45.360 --> 1:35:50.240]  pretty powerful and the headlines that Brian Terry die in vain it's an
[1:35:50.240 --> 1:35:54.280]  important article and there's some talking points in here that I think I'm
[1:35:54.280 --> 1:35:59.520]  going to probably try to add into this or maybe augment the article because the
[1:35:59.520 --> 1:36:08.120]  headline should probably be you know researchers or experts fast and furious
[1:36:08.120 --> 1:36:12.560]  linked to Benghazi linked to Syria or or I'm not sure where we should go with
[1:36:12.560 --> 1:36:17.000]  this I want to publish it just like this I'll publish it with this headline did
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:22.400]  Brian Terry die in vain a call to Congress to find answers but in my
[1:36:22.400 --> 1:36:27.880]  experience that might be a sub headline what is I mean I've read the article
[1:36:27.880 --> 1:36:33.280]  Colonel Smith Mac what do you think the top headline should be because as you
[1:36:33.280 --> 1:36:37.880]  know I mean that's emblematic of catching people's attention to to really
[1:36:37.880 --> 1:36:45.000]  get people to realize what a bombshell report this is yes sir not not being as
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:49.720]  accomplished journalist as you are but I would I would say it's the it's the
[1:36:49.720 --> 1:36:53.360]  whole side of the story has never been told I mean I don't I never heard except
[1:36:53.360 --> 1:36:57.600]  except for talking to the Terry family what Brian Terry was doing I mean this
[1:36:57.600 --> 1:37:03.240]  this has never been reported on in his concerns that he was approached by quote
[1:37:03.240 --> 1:37:07.440]  bad agents unquote that he used words he used to his mom that they were
[1:37:07.440 --> 1:37:11.600]  aggressive telling him to back off that he didn't want to go back there that his
[1:37:11.600 --> 1:37:15.200]  house was searched by the government without us without a court order without
[1:37:15.200 --> 1:37:18.840]  permission of the family you know that every electronic media device was taken
[1:37:18.840 --> 1:37:23.880]  out of his home because when his dad Brian's dad had told the US Attorney
[1:37:23.880 --> 1:37:28.200]  there Burke who now by the way from what Kent was telling me is he and that
[1:37:28.200 --> 1:37:31.200]  former head of the board trial down there in Arizona worked together to high
[1:37:31.200 --> 1:37:36.880]  power law firm in DC that you know they they went into his home and took every
[1:37:36.880 --> 1:37:41.440]  electronic media device kept it away for a year give it back to the family with
[1:37:41.440 --> 1:37:44.840]  it everything completely wiped I mean cell phones computers laptops and you
[1:37:44.840 --> 1:37:51.080]  talk to the family you get that you get that that that detail so my point is
[1:37:51.080 --> 1:37:57.040]  that yes sir I think it's you had you had Brian perhaps unbeknownst to the to
[1:37:57.040 --> 1:38:01.480]  the extent he was on to this he he was uncovering this and when he would talk
[1:38:01.480 --> 1:38:05.720]  and call his superiors they were told let it go let them go let the vehicles go
[1:38:05.720 --> 1:38:09.080]  let the weapons go and he was finding you know weapons and crates OEM and
[1:38:09.080 --> 1:38:12.800]  original equipment manufacturing crates as you said so you don't you don't go
[1:38:12.800 --> 1:38:16.880]  and get all these things from a gun store you know when we told Representative
[1:38:16.880 --> 1:38:22.640]  Issa and House oversight back in October 2013 that there are grenades and
[1:38:22.640 --> 1:38:27.440]  grenade launchers involved when these shipments go on South you know DOJ OIG
[1:38:27.440 --> 1:38:32.760]  didn't make that public until October 30th 2014 so a year ahead of time you
[1:38:32.760 --> 1:38:37.600]  know we're telling ice and House oversight that this this is going on and
[1:38:37.600 --> 1:38:43.200]  and again a lot of a lot of commotion a lot of they say in physics Brownian
[1:38:43.200 --> 1:38:49.000]  motion there's a lot of a lot of activity but no vector and it's it's
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:55.760]  incomprehensible to me that sir that element that ATF DEA whomever else
[1:38:55.760 --> 1:39:03.040]  utilized to actually buy the weapons run the weapons it seems as if nobody in
[1:39:03.040 --> 1:39:08.920]  law enforcement or the oversight has utilized that same group of people to
[1:39:08.920 --> 1:39:15.160]  get the answers and now again you have a central figure who is willing has been
[1:39:15.160 --> 1:39:21.840]  since 2012 willing to work with in this case you know law enforcement House
[1:39:21.840 --> 1:39:25.680]  oversight center grasses office and and no one's really pursue the only only
[1:39:25.680 --> 1:39:30.280]  person really pursuing this now say for you is again is another investigative
[1:39:30.280 --> 1:39:34.560]  journalist on a major cable news network and feel free to tell us about the
[1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:40.360]  the individual that's willing to speak and the other cable hosts that's getting
[1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:45.280]  into this yes sir well you know the the name of the person I don't want to use
[1:39:45.280 --> 1:39:50.360]  certainly right now this because of okay I understand so that source isn't out
[1:39:50.360 --> 1:39:55.440]  yet it hadn't been given to the media to understand that makes sense or and you
[1:39:55.440 --> 1:40:01.880]  know to be to be fair it's mr. William Lajanes of Fox News you know I had a
[1:40:01.880 --> 1:40:07.800]  folks a gentleman in Congress had given me an insight to email James Rosen and
[1:40:07.800 --> 1:40:12.680]  James Rosen as gentlemanly in emails as he is on air he referred me over to mr.
[1:40:12.680 --> 1:40:18.160]  Lajanes mr. Lajanes has taken it up and he's in contact with this person on a
[1:40:18.160 --> 1:40:22.800]  regular basis and you know there are plans to to move forward to further
[1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:27.280]  cover what's going on yeah Lajanes is one of the best people at Fox he's one
[1:40:27.280 --> 1:40:29.880]  of their roving reporters actually on the West Coast for folks that don't know
[1:40:29.880 --> 1:40:33.240]  what he is and he's one of the best reporters over there he's been on the
[1:40:33.240 --> 1:40:36.080]  show five or six times over the years and I've been involved in one of his
[1:40:36.080 --> 1:40:39.920]  productions and he's one of the few people that actually will put his career
[1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:42.640]  on the line with this type of information and let's not forget what
[1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:46.960]  happened to Cheryl Atkinson when she exposed fashion furious I mean they
[1:40:46.960 --> 1:40:50.360]  really come after people who are willing to touch this and that's why so much the
[1:40:50.360 --> 1:40:54.560]  media won't go there that's why I say that was in a kernel you're a hero the
[1:40:54.560 --> 1:40:58.920]  family are heroes because in a nation of cowards and I love America but in our
[1:40:58.920 --> 1:41:04.000]  media and our politicians it's a lot of really cowardly people and as you said
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:07.560]  earlier if you can just get back into some of the type of weapons to remember
[1:41:07.560 --> 1:41:11.560]  seeing in the news that we're military full-auto hand grenades you I mean
[1:41:11.560 --> 1:41:14.960]  civilians can't get those even with a stamp you can't get the hand grenades
[1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:19.280]  and this is going through it's coming off military bases it's coming out of
[1:41:19.280 --> 1:41:25.080]  different caches it's it's it's just wild that this is going on and then just
[1:41:25.080 --> 1:41:29.080]  finish up with getting into the intel on the fact that you're saying from your
[1:41:29.080 --> 1:41:35.000]  sources more of this is moving across yes sir yeah more as we said about the
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:41.520]  weapons again not just rifles and pistols and not not 2,000 but more in
[1:41:41.520 --> 1:41:48.520]  the magnitude of about 4,700 would be be more appropriate and you have a military
[1:41:48.520 --> 1:41:54.680]  a nexus there you know I was approached by a Colonel Taylor who Air Force person
[1:41:54.680 --> 1:41:58.320]  what that was a name or not I don't know for real but that's what he identified
[1:41:58.320 --> 1:42:03.000]  himself as an Air Force uniform told me he was from OSI office of special
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:07.840]  investigation and that the military was aware of possible military installation
[1:42:07.840 --> 1:42:13.560]  and equipment involvement with fast and furious you know and if you if you trace
[1:42:13.560 --> 1:42:18.440]  this back you'll find that the genesis of this or the birthplace of this is
[1:42:18.440 --> 1:42:22.840]  in Yuma, Arizona you know about circa 2005 and it migrated its way off and
[1:42:22.840 --> 1:42:28.200]  perhaps why I got involved with this or was asked to get involved is you know I
[1:42:28.200 --> 1:42:32.780]  spent many years in Yuma at our at our weapons school in the Marine Corps
[1:42:32.780 --> 1:42:38.400]  Mots 1 which is like the Marine Corps top gun and that's where it started and
[1:42:38.400 --> 1:42:44.000]  it migrated out so we we have repeatedly passed this information on of note
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:50.040]  also sir on the president's day of 2014 I was approached by two folks identified
[1:42:50.040 --> 1:42:54.840]  themselves as agents Weston and Maxwell told me that my contacts in DC it got a
[1:42:54.840 --> 1:43:00.680]  hold of them they knew what was going on stand by big news soon that was a
[1:43:00.680 --> 1:43:05.040]  Monday president's day 2014 well that Friday guess what happened who's when
[1:43:05.040 --> 1:43:09.440]  get captured you know is it coincidence who knows but there I think there's so
[1:43:09.440 --> 1:43:14.680]  many layers to the sir like like an onion and again the fact that you have
[1:43:14.680 --> 1:43:20.360]  access to some of the folks who were actually involved and nobody has really
[1:43:20.360 --> 1:43:26.240]  taken that up and utilize this this this person who's willing to put his life on
[1:43:26.240 --> 1:43:30.480]  the line and you're right so people do get attacked as I as I was telling your
[1:43:30.480 --> 1:43:35.360]  producers and others you know at March 22nd of last year I got I got I got a
[1:43:35.360 --> 1:43:38.680]  I got accosted I got knocked down I got told that obviously I wasn't getting the
[1:43:38.680 --> 1:43:42.040]  message keep my mouth shut I made a report to the local police I made a
[1:43:42.040 --> 1:43:45.040]  report to the FBI I mean this is the kind of stuff that's going on with this
[1:43:45.040 --> 1:43:48.800]  topic wow I didn't realize you've been physically attacked yeah I one time was
[1:43:48.800 --> 1:43:52.920]  investigating corruption and in federal court case and they got really upset and
[1:43:52.920 --> 1:43:55.840]  kept calm as they were coming down there outside your studio to attack you and
[1:43:55.840 --> 1:43:59.520]  then when I got there was like came out was like five before I'm attacked me
[1:43:59.520 --> 1:44:04.760]  guys I knew how to fight and I was like wow this like a movie but I mean it
[1:44:04.760 --> 1:44:08.640]  really shows why this country is in so much trouble that's amazing I mean
[1:44:08.640 --> 1:44:11.280]  specifically what happened to you what somebody just hits you from behind or
[1:44:11.280 --> 1:44:15.880]  what happened yes sir was the evening I got I got knocked down from behind hard
[1:44:15.880 --> 1:44:19.800]  enough it knocked my glasses off and when I let go off I don't see too far the
[1:44:19.800 --> 1:44:24.720]  person again then I was on the ground kicked me in the back told me try to
[1:44:24.720 --> 1:44:28.600]  get it as accurate as I can that obviously I wasn't getting the blanking
[1:44:28.600 --> 1:44:34.440]  message to keep my mouth shut and then he took off there was a car backing out
[1:44:34.440 --> 1:44:38.960]  he got in the car so I had to be two people and and took off and that was on
[1:44:38.960 --> 1:44:45.240]  the 22nd of March at around 10 p.m. and then that next day you know I made I
[1:44:45.240 --> 1:44:50.640]  made reports both to the local police and and called into the FBI and then
[1:44:50.640 --> 1:44:54.960]  what naturally interviewed with the FBI well I imagine you got that concealed

[2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:20.400]  lancing a boil or pulling a rotten tooth it's for the better and putting it out
[2:00:20.400 --> 2:00:24.360]  there that's happening exposes it that's why the enemy doesn't want to expose
[2:00:24.360 --> 2:00:27.920]  it's obvious let's go people say man you're so negative you cover all this
[2:00:27.920 --> 2:00:33.720]  scary bad stuff that's because the enemy doesn't want it exposed that's why
[2:00:33.720 --> 2:00:37.400]  we're exposing it I know I mumbled this this morning but I'm going from memory
[2:00:37.400 --> 2:00:41.760]  we do have the guys popping in at 130 right from Wisconsin good good kid
[2:00:41.760 --> 2:00:46.280]  Daniels Rob do and Michael Zimmerman I believe her who we sent we've already
[2:00:46.280 --> 2:00:52.720]  got a lot of amazing stuff there with the Ford Foundation Rockefeller Foundation
[2:00:52.720 --> 2:00:57.200]  George Soros moron bots running around with the usual suspects trying to
[2:00:57.200 --> 2:01:03.560]  violate people's first amendment and blaming Trump and others for it and
[2:01:03.560 --> 2:01:09.840]  they're hitting pay dirt with their operatives they had some of the folks
[2:01:09.840 --> 2:01:15.200]  with Breitbart I think it's an overall good organization but there's been an
[2:01:15.200 --> 2:01:24.240]  attempt to divert them off course obviously bump into the Trump chief of
[2:01:24.240 --> 2:01:28.240]  staff campaign manager and I've seen the video from every angle it looks like he
[2:01:28.240 --> 2:01:32.000]  might grab her by the arm she doesn't fall down the ground her first report
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:37.680]  was she was pushed to the ground it's not true and you're walking along with
[2:01:37.680 --> 2:01:40.080]  Donald Trump people are grabbing at you left and right I mean he started getting
[2:01:40.080 --> 2:01:42.960]  your arms grab you're going to crowd you go to a rock concert try to get to the
[2:01:42.960 --> 2:01:45.520]  very front you're gonna get grabbed you're gonna get pushed what do you do
[2:01:45.520 --> 2:01:53.960]  call the police don't put yourself in that situation but the cops let most of
[2:01:53.960 --> 2:02:02.920]  people go that go punching people at these events they just let them go I
[2:02:02.920 --> 2:02:08.600]  always pronounce his name wrong it's Corey Luna Bob Dowsky is that right
[2:02:08.600 --> 2:02:13.400]  Lewandowski Lewandowski campaign manager for Donald Trump is charged with
[2:02:13.400 --> 2:02:19.200]  battery dun dun dun Hillary's not charged with Benghazi or anything or
[2:02:19.200 --> 2:02:24.400]  Obama for ordering the board patrol to stand down and high treason or any of
[2:02:24.400 --> 2:02:27.840]  the other innumerable crimes the IRS persecuting people but let me tell you
[2:02:27.840 --> 2:02:32.640]  that big old meanie Megan Kelly is on him and whoever talks in her ear in the
[2:02:32.640 --> 2:02:39.600]  teleprompter whoever writes Megan Kelly stuff they are on Trump that'd be Roger
[2:02:39.600 --> 2:02:45.440]  Rails the guy that launched Rush Limbaugh first Rush Limbaugh isn't against
[2:02:45.440 --> 2:02:50.000]  Trump as you realize it's political suicide to be against Trump he is the
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:54.120]  populist figurehead I've said it a hundred times I'll say it again whether
[2:02:54.120 --> 2:02:57.720]  you love Trump or hate him and I've got some reservations they're scared to death
[2:02:57.720 --> 2:03:03.080]  of him he represents populism they are absolutely in trouble it the fact that
[2:03:03.080 --> 2:03:07.600]  they're having to cheat openly is devastating the globalist irrevocably
[2:03:07.600 --> 2:03:13.360]  irrevocable irrevocation of what credibility was left they are running
[2:03:13.360 --> 2:03:17.960]  on fumes they had an inch of gas six months ago they are on fumes that
[2:03:17.960 --> 2:03:23.200]  engine's already starting to give around a gas oh my gosh I gotta get to a
[2:03:23.200 --> 2:03:27.400]  gas station there's 100 yards away there's one you know a mile away and
[2:03:27.400 --> 2:03:30.120]  your car runs out and you got a walk a half mile you get a gas tank and come
[2:03:30.120 --> 2:03:36.640]  fill it up the engine is sputtering they're out of gas
[2:03:36.640 --> 2:03:40.000]  historically they're gonna pull some monkey business you better believe the
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:42.920]  globalist they're gonna start some wars some economic collapses some

[2:08:18.120 --> 2:08:26.560]  against the global technocratic tyranny. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:08:29.880 --> 2:08:35.320]  Corey Lewandowski is the chief of staff for Donald Trump and I've seen two
[2:08:35.320 --> 2:08:39.580]  different side videos of the woman looks like she's touching him and he
[2:08:39.580 --> 2:08:43.240]  brushes past her maybe touches her shoulder she said he pushed her down
[2:08:43.240 --> 2:08:47.840]  on the ground there is no footage of that now people say oh this is just you
[2:08:47.840 --> 2:08:51.800]  know some police report so they had to do it because she pressed charges what's
[2:08:51.800 --> 2:08:56.400]  the big deal well it shows how when Donald Trump sneezes they say that a
[2:08:56.400 --> 2:09:03.040]  typhoon hit Tokyo but we now have the surveillance footage that the police have
[2:09:03.040 --> 2:09:06.760]  and we're showing it to TV viewers right now I'm describing it for radio
[2:09:06.760 --> 2:09:11.240]  listeners and the reporter comes up beside him and it looks like all he does
[2:09:11.240 --> 2:09:20.360]  is touch her on the shoulder I mean that's it and when and we'll back it up
[2:09:20.360 --> 2:09:26.400]  and show it again it is just crazy you see Donald Trump come by and then she
[2:09:26.400 --> 2:09:33.680]  walks over and Lewandowski just touches her on the shoulder and steps in she's
[2:09:33.680 --> 2:09:40.920]  not pushed down any of it they could charge anybody now in a crowd this is
[2:09:40.920 --> 2:09:46.120]  wild taps her on the shoulder and I've seen the other angle to where that's
[2:09:46.120 --> 2:09:48.920]  what he did they said oh another angle will show him pushing her down the
[2:09:48.920 --> 2:09:55.080]  ground did not happen did not happen did not happen you talk about a staged
[2:09:55.080 --> 2:10:01.160]  event you talk about a false flag that's a frame up it's a frame job but it's a
[2:10:01.160 --> 2:10:06.200]  way he attacked women it's the narrative like the Bush campaign person that
[2:10:06.200 --> 2:10:09.280]  worked for other big Republicans gets up at the town hall puts her hands on her
[2:10:09.280 --> 2:10:14.920]  hips and goes why are you mean to women why do you hate him I don't like you and
[2:10:14.920 --> 2:10:20.080]  then it turns out it was all staged all about manipulating women to go basically
[2:10:20.080 --> 2:10:25.360]  vote for Hillary all about demonizing Donald Trump to women and people love to
[2:10:25.360 --> 2:10:29.440]  be manipulated like like they're important oh and then you've got this
[2:10:29.440 --> 2:10:40.680]  woman this reporter all over the news talking about how scared she was and how
[2:10:40.680 --> 2:10:47.640]  horrible it was and I personally have been involved in political rallies where
[2:10:47.640 --> 2:10:52.240]  the quote opposition has had a woman run up and claimed that I pushed them when
[2:10:52.240 --> 2:10:56.120]  I haven't even touched them this is a classic classic it's like when they said
[2:10:56.120 --> 2:11:00.280]  that I said kill Michelle Malkin within an hour of her putting that out at the
[2:11:00.280 --> 2:11:08.640]  Denver Mint at the RNC covering a protest they had national news I'd said
[2:11:08.640 --> 2:11:12.080]  kill Michelle Malkin and I ran to the hotel room we had our own camera
[2:11:12.080 --> 2:11:16.200]  footage showed the people that were with her at the event behind me screaming
[2:11:16.200 --> 2:11:20.960]  kill Michelle Malkin they left with her and I had to send that to the media and
[2:11:20.960 --> 2:11:24.840]  they all did retractions the Denver Post extra you name it except the Dallas
[2:11:24.840 --> 2:11:30.240]  Morning News I had a family in Dallas calling me going you want to kill a
[2:11:30.240 --> 2:11:36.000]  little woman and I said no they stood behind me and shouted it and then they
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:40.000]  shot footage from the front but from the side to make it look like I did that's
[2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:45.240]  how they operate I personally personally like that you that's still on
[2:11:45.240 --> 2:11:49.400]  YouTube whoever what it's called proof Alex Jones didn't say kill Michelle
[2:11:49.400 --> 2:11:55.280]  Malkin but it's the perfect thing the man wanted her dead there was a crowd he
[2:11:55.280 --> 2:12:07.040]  had cited them to kill her and I've learned since those setups when I go
[2:12:07.040 --> 2:12:12.680]  into a crowd now I got an iPhone in my top pocket running recording and that
[2:12:12.680 --> 2:12:16.080]  way there's a complete record of everything and I'm gonna get you when
[2:12:16.080 --> 2:12:21.120]  you think you get me and that's why I will not go in rooms dressing rooms
[2:12:21.120 --> 2:12:24.800]  behind stages where I'm speaking anywhere where the woman alone I see a
[2:12:24.800 --> 2:12:29.000]  woman come in I go excuse me you get out of here right now get back just even
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:33.360]  turns the same way get back get back get back do not come in the room so she
[2:12:33.360 --> 2:12:36.600]  had to do in America because it's the number one dirty trick they pull and
[2:12:36.600 --> 2:12:41.240]  now they do it on surveillance cameras from three angles he touches her arm
[2:12:41.240 --> 2:12:50.200]  and she's reaching out for Donald Trump and now he's the evil man that attacked
[2:12:50.200 --> 2:12:54.640]  the woman I got a bunch of clips I want to play but I'm open to the phones up
[2:12:54.640 --> 2:12:59.200]  right now before we talk to Rob doing others at about 40 after there in
[2:12:59.200 --> 2:13:03.000]  Wisconsin covering the big Trump event coming up where the bikers for Trump
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:11.400]  were set to square off they'll be the police there and the anti-Trumpians we
[2:13:11.400 --> 2:13:15.840]  have video on infowars.com we're gonna play here of anti-Trump supporter attacks
[2:13:15.840 --> 2:13:20.160]  a man with a Trump sign and colleges everywhere if Trump is written on the
[2:13:20.160 --> 2:13:25.200]  chalkboard or Trump is written on chalk just Trump 2016 hysteria psychologist
[2:13:25.200 --> 2:13:31.040]  crying trauma fear the the the deans come out and say this is trauma this is
[2:13:31.040 --> 2:13:36.400]  hate we're so sorry they validate the mental illness imagine doing a skit where
[2:13:36.400 --> 2:13:41.120]  I walk around town and see Trump on a car Trump I'm go and then call the police
[2:13:41.120 --> 2:13:44.760]  I mean actually call 911 to me and the cops come in a recipe for false report
[2:13:44.760 --> 2:13:48.680]  I'll go no I'm scared my safe place but see I won't do that because it's a
[2:13:48.680 --> 2:13:52.400]  false report imagine the it's like somebody calling the cops on somebody
[2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:56.000]  at McDonald's because their their their quarter pounder was cold you know that
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:13:59.720]  really happened or was it a big Mac we look at everything it's a big Mac but
[2:13:59.720 --> 2:14:03.840]  woman calls police on McDonald's because food is cold they arrested her for a
[2:14:03.840 --> 2:14:11.280]  false report but now there is student president feels threatened by Trump 2016
[2:14:11.280 --> 2:14:16.960]  written on a whiteboard and then another college was written in the chalk on the
[2:14:16.960 --> 2:14:20.360]  grounds everyone's freaking out and psychologists are called in and remember
[2:14:20.360 --> 2:14:24.040]  the reports that project Veritas did where they go in behind the scenes and
[2:14:24.040 --> 2:14:27.320]  go I was frightened by a pocket Constitution I'm traumatized they go
[2:14:27.320 --> 2:14:30.080]  we'll get your student counseling you have a right to be traumatized that's
[2:14:30.080 --> 2:14:39.640]  a horrible document I'm scared it's scary but in Pennsylvania the name of
[2:14:39.640 --> 2:14:51.040]  the dormitories Lynch oh yeah and now that he's asking about internment camps
[2:14:51.040 --> 2:14:55.760]  do we have that clip yeah here's Trump for the second time I'm gonna go to
[2:14:55.760 --> 2:14:59.600]  Tucker Alex John Sydney and others and Brandon on what do you think's going on
[2:14:59.600 --> 2:15:03.000]  fast and furious when we know part of it that how big is it now going to the
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:07.280]  Middle East you know Marine Corps Lieutenant-Colonels investigating
[2:15:07.280 --> 2:15:11.920]  getting attacked I mean death threats you name it that last hour interview was
[2:15:11.920 --> 2:15:15.080]  bombshell we were getting that out big tomorrow with a big article with all the
[2:15:15.080 --> 2:15:18.240]  facts in the video we need a maximum push on that we're on your calls in a
[2:15:18.240 --> 2:15:22.640]  moment but here's Trump will you put us in internment camps here it is yes you
[2:15:22.640 --> 2:15:29.760]  said that Islam is at war with us a lot of people wonder given some of your
[2:15:29.760 --> 2:15:35.960]  proposals whether or not you would go the next step towards internment camps and
[2:15:35.960 --> 2:15:40.040]  I know you've never proposed that but let me just ask you here now would you
[2:15:40.040 --> 2:15:45.200]  categorically rule out the idea of internment camps for American Muslims
[2:15:45.200 --> 2:15:49.360]  is that something we'll never rule it out but we would have to be very vigilant
[2:15:49.360 --> 2:15:53.080]  we're gonna have to be very smart we're gonna have to be very rich very
[2:15:53.080 --> 2:16:00.520]  vigilant and if we're not very very strong and very very smart we have a big
[2:16:00.520 --> 2:16:04.960]  big problem coming up we've already had the problem check out the World Trade
[2:16:04.960 --> 2:16:09.720]  Center okay check out the Pentagon we've already had the problem so I would
[2:16:09.720 --> 2:16:14.320]  I would say you have to be extremely strong you have to keep your eyes open
[2:16:14.320 --> 2:16:21.280]  and by the way Muslims in our country have to report bad acts okay when you
[2:16:21.280 --> 2:16:25.240]  look at what happened in Europe in Brussels where many many people knew
[2:16:25.240 --> 2:16:30.640]  this thug from last week was was living right in the midst of them right
[2:16:30.640 --> 2:16:36.560]  right only a few doors down and he was a open borders migrant rights activist
[2:16:36.560 --> 2:16:41.160]  look here's what's gonna happen this is why Lewis Furcon who's a Muslim doesn't
[2:16:41.160 --> 2:16:45.080]  want non-screen Muslims coming in agrees with Donald Trump because most of
[2:16:45.080 --> 2:16:48.480]  Muslims in this country do don't want to blow stuff up and they're not bad
[2:16:48.480 --> 2:16:52.680]  people okay because they've been more westernized the radical ones come in
[2:16:52.680 --> 2:16:56.800]  they're going to attack and then all Muslims are gonna get targeted that's
[2:16:56.800 --> 2:17:00.720]  what the class of civilizations is being carried out by the neocons it's the
[2:17:00.720 --> 2:17:04.280]  ultimate false flag that they bring them in let them attack and then take our
[2:17:04.280 --> 2:17:12.200]  rights and that's what they're doing it's not Donald Trump's fault all right
[2:17:12.200 --> 2:17:16.360]  let's go ahead and go to your phone calls Alex in Virginia Alex you're on
[2:17:16.360 --> 2:17:21.120]  the air what do you think of that interview last hour well I had two
[2:17:21.120 --> 2:17:27.160]  questions for you Alex first of all I'm 22 and I would like to know what she's
[2:17:27.160 --> 2:17:32.880]  think about fast and furious do you believe that it was intended to go to
[2:17:32.880 --> 2:17:37.960]  the Middle East from the beginning or do you think it was just in the beginning
[2:17:37.960 --> 2:17:44.840]  for the drug war for their profits anything that the globalists do I've
[2:17:44.840 --> 2:17:50.640]  noticed over the years is done to have multiple effects so ship the guns in
[2:17:50.640 --> 2:17:54.480]  destabilize Mexico make sure you drive up the price of the drug shutting down
[2:17:54.480 --> 2:17:58.760]  some of the cartels so the banks can launder more money and then also you
[2:17:58.760 --> 2:18:03.360]  got the big international banks flying people out for torture on one plane
[2:18:03.360 --> 2:18:07.320]  drugs back in with the other we know El Chapo was tied him with ISIS and had to
[2:18:07.320 --> 2:18:10.400]  threaten them when they took some of his shipments they shipped the guns out
[2:18:10.400 --> 2:18:14.840]  there but they fence it through Mexico so it's all one big multifaceted
[2:18:14.840 --> 2:18:21.840]  organization okay I appreciate your call I appreciate your call I was asking you
[2:18:21.840 --> 2:18:25.440]  guys what you think about that interview and where this is all going and how big
[2:18:25.440 --> 2:18:31.360]  the false flag is but thank you trucker Tim in Texas you're on the air
[2:18:32.320 --> 2:18:39.040]  God bless you Alex well thank you brother go ahead yeah I listen into the
[2:18:39.040 --> 2:18:44.040]  interview and I knew it when it came out back when it came out originally that

[2:33:35.200 --> 2:33:38.800]  Trump is gonna be speaking coming up in a little while Rob do tell us what's
[2:33:38.800 --> 2:33:43.040]  coming up my friend yes is Rob do reporting for live from Jamesville
[2:33:43.040 --> 2:33:45.880]  Wisconsin where the Trump rally is gonna take place at this holiday and
[2:33:45.880 --> 2:33:52.080]  express to my left and about three hours or so he goes on at four and so a lot
[2:33:52.080 --> 2:33:56.120]  of protesters have gathered up this here individual here is Luke he's been
[2:33:56.120 --> 2:34:00.840]  playing music for everybody and so Luke tell me why you're here. Donald Trump is
[2:34:00.840 --> 2:34:06.480]  a racist that's clear and simple he makes these accusations about people that
[2:34:06.480 --> 2:34:11.600]  are purely false and he scapegoats everyone he scapegoats everyone. Ask what
[2:34:11.600 --> 2:34:15.560]  the accusations are that are false. I mean we can't have that type of thing in a
[2:34:15.560 --> 2:34:20.400]  presidential election it's disgraceful to see you know I mean that we have this
[2:34:20.400 --> 2:34:24.720]  guy who's making remarks. Do you have any specifics that you can give me? What do you mean? Oh well okay
[2:34:24.720 --> 2:34:28.160]  for instance he made that he made he made he's made comments about how he wants
[2:34:28.160 --> 2:34:33.320]  to you know patrol or that was Ted Cruz I think but I think Donald Trump said
[2:34:33.320 --> 2:34:41.640]  something similar. You know it's the same thing I guess. Okay but come on now. He said we will he
[2:34:41.640 --> 2:34:45.240]  wants to stop immigrants coming in and he makes these. He said he wants to vet
[2:34:45.240 --> 2:34:47.600]  immigrants he said there's nothing wrong with having immigrants he just wants to
[2:34:47.600 --> 2:34:52.880]  vet them. What? Oh oh no no no he said he said no and I remember this he said
[2:34:52.880 --> 2:34:58.240]  specifically we're going to we're going to shut down immigration until we figure
[2:34:58.240 --> 2:35:02.200]  out what's going on. Exactly. Yeah they're not checking the IDs of the
[2:35:02.200 --> 2:35:06.160]  Homeland Security and the FBI said we don't we can't properly vet Syrian
[2:35:06.160 --> 2:35:09.920]  refugees coming into this country and from other Muslim places. Italy just
[2:35:09.920 --> 2:35:16.720]  closed three of its borders with Albania. Is Italy racist? The Homeland Security they're scared of everyone right?
[2:35:16.720 --> 2:35:20.880]  I mean they're looking at your emails they're looking at my emails like so. Okay what about
[2:35:20.880 --> 2:35:24.800]  Macedonia just put up a border wall from migrants. Macedonia they just put up a
[2:35:24.800 --> 2:35:27.520]  border fence essentially to keep migrants coming out because they're being
[2:35:27.520 --> 2:35:31.320]  flooded and it's destroying their country. Does that does that make it okay? Well that
[2:35:31.320 --> 2:35:34.200]  doesn't make him racist. Ask the city if he has a front door. Ask him if he has a door.
[2:35:34.200 --> 2:35:37.360]  That doesn't make him racist. But the comments that you're making. Ask him if he has a door.
[2:35:37.360 --> 2:35:41.520]  That's what they are. Now I think what's going on is there's there's racial
[2:35:41.520 --> 2:35:46.040]  division being propagated by a man named George Soros who you're you're spotting
[2:35:46.040 --> 2:35:49.240]  a lot of his talking points unfortunately and he's a billionaire and
[2:35:49.240 --> 2:35:52.680]  you're here against billionaires but George Soros is a billionaire. George Soros
[2:35:52.680 --> 2:35:57.880]  George Soros is yeah sure but. Ask him if he has a front door it's the same as a fence.
[2:35:57.880 --> 2:36:01.920]  George Soros and Donald Trump no they're just the same side they're two
[2:36:01.920 --> 2:36:05.480]  different sides of the same coin. But you're spouting his talking points.
[2:36:05.480 --> 2:36:10.920]  George Soros care about immigrants? No he doesn't but he doesn't he wants to have
[2:36:10.920 --> 2:36:14.520]  his. No he wants to destroy the country. Oh he wants to destroy the country and
[2:36:14.520 --> 2:36:18.240]  Donald Trump doesn't. No I don't think he wants to destroy the country. Really.
[2:36:18.240 --> 2:36:22.440]  Are you employed right now or are you in school? What I'm a high school student.
[2:36:22.440 --> 2:36:28.160]  I think that you are making comments that are very clearly like trying to make me
[2:36:28.160 --> 2:36:34.400]  look bad and that's that's cool and that's cool I get it. Ask Ronald McDonald if he has a door.
[2:36:34.400 --> 2:36:39.880]  I have no idea. Ask me has a door. I think once again this is this. Does he have a door on his house?
[2:36:39.880 --> 2:36:46.320]  Is there a fence on his yard? Well then equality has gone up over the last 50 years
[2:36:46.320 --> 2:36:49.600]  immensely and it's because of guys like George Soros and Donald Trump who take
[2:36:49.600 --> 2:36:53.600]  jobs out of America and put them into. Actually Bill Clinton helped take jobs out of America.
[2:36:53.600 --> 2:36:56.800]  Ask this more on of you has a door on his house. No he's a neoliberal Democrat.
[2:36:56.800 --> 2:37:01.920]  Alright Alex wants to know if you have a door on your house. Alex Jones is talking to you
[2:37:01.920 --> 2:37:04.920]  right there through that camera. He wants to know if you have a door on your house.
[2:37:04.920 --> 2:37:10.440]  Are a fence in your yard? I live with my parents. I'm 18. I'm in high school.
[2:37:10.440 --> 2:37:14.360]  Do you have a door in your house right? Is this what conservatives do?
[2:37:14.360 --> 2:37:19.040]  We're liberals dumbass. We're the real deal. We're here to save the country.
[2:37:19.040 --> 2:37:23.360]  We built it. My point is if you have a door on your house, you're an idiot.
[2:37:23.360 --> 2:37:28.320]  Keep uninvited people out. Correct? Sure. Okay. So then what's wrong with having that at your country?
[2:37:28.320 --> 2:37:32.040]  What? What's wrong with having that at your country? A door or a fence?
[2:37:32.040 --> 2:37:36.760]  A door or a fence. Yeah. It's the same concept. You're keeping people out that you don't want to
[2:37:36.760 --> 2:37:40.320]  invite into your house. Why don't we want them here? Why don't we want them here?
[2:37:40.320 --> 2:37:44.480]  Because they're getting free stuff dumb bogey. Because what they're doing is being brought here
[2:37:44.480 --> 2:37:47.680]  and then they're giving lots of free stuff. They're giving lots of free stuff. Where's this
[2:37:47.680 --> 2:37:52.400]  magical free stuff coming from? You'll find out. You know who gets all the free stuff?
[2:37:52.400 --> 2:37:56.120]  A lot of corporations do. We're against that too.
[2:37:56.120 --> 2:37:58.880]  You guys want to get the interview that's cool.
[2:37:58.880 --> 2:38:03.080]  All the social justice order just came over and said stop. Let me see you. Are you going to handle her here?
[2:38:03.080 --> 2:38:06.680]  No, I'm not. I'm encouraging you to not stand in front of our sign and you can do the interview somewhere else.
[2:38:06.680 --> 2:38:09.880]  No, no. We have free speech. No, we have free speech too. Stop it.
[2:38:09.880 --> 2:38:15.480]  No, we have free speech too. Which? Well, your sign's pretty big. He was playing. My boss wanted to interview him.
[2:38:15.480 --> 2:38:20.880]  Yeah, that's fine. I'm just asking you to move over. No, no, no. Stay there. Free speech.
[2:38:20.880 --> 2:38:24.480]  We're conservative asking dumb questions. Let's get out. Let's get out this way.
[2:38:24.480 --> 2:38:27.880]  And they're going to try to run him off there and I'll watch. This will encourage them to run him off. Get ready.
[2:38:27.880 --> 2:38:32.880]  No, no, no, no. Submitting to them. This is live TV folks, infowars.com.
[2:38:32.880 --> 2:38:37.880]  We're live right now. So tell me about your sign.
[2:38:37.880 --> 2:38:41.880]  It says give love, live peace. You didn't know what sign you were carrying?
[2:38:41.880 --> 2:38:46.880]  Oh, this one. It's okay to hate things that are evil. Fascism is evil.
[2:38:46.880 --> 2:38:51.880]  I agree. Fascism is evil. Yeah. What about Hillary finding the radical Muslims? Is that fascism?
[2:38:51.880 --> 2:38:58.880]  And he says things like, we're going to win this with our Second Amendment rights. You can't tell me that's not threatening people.
[2:38:58.880 --> 2:39:03.880]  Not saying that. I think there's people shooting people all the time, especially in Chicago.
[2:39:03.880 --> 2:39:07.880]  My love came from Mexico. They don't need to be sent back. They don't need walls.
[2:39:07.880 --> 2:39:09.880]  I live in Texas. I have nothing wrong with that.
[2:39:09.880 --> 2:39:12.880]  Ask her if people attacking Donald Trump supporters is okay.
[2:39:12.880 --> 2:39:18.880]  The guy does not need to be our president. So is it okay when people attack Donald Trump supporters?
[2:39:18.880 --> 2:39:21.880]  People can support what they want.
[2:39:21.880 --> 2:39:25.880]  Hey dude, go back. They don't want you over there in front of the sign. Go over there and let them see how they do with the First Amendment.
[2:39:25.880 --> 2:39:27.880]  Because it shows that there's still racism alive.
[2:39:27.880 --> 2:39:31.880]  I guarantee you, they're about to say, call over the muscle. They're about to thug out.
[2:39:31.880 --> 2:39:33.880]  There's still people that just hate you.
[2:39:33.880 --> 2:39:35.880]  Alright, well thank you.
[2:39:35.880 --> 2:39:37.880]  Alright, we're going to go over here.
[2:39:37.880 --> 2:39:40.880]  Look at these people, man.
[2:39:40.880 --> 2:39:43.880]  They got the cops right there. They're trying to tell him what he can and can't do.
[2:39:43.880 --> 2:39:45.880]  We're going to run a Black Panther party.
[2:39:45.880 --> 2:39:50.880]  Alright. Let's go interview some more of the folks there. Go back to Ronald McDonald.
[2:39:50.880 --> 2:39:54.880]  Ask Kim, say, hey, ask him if McDonald's has given him a contract yet.
[2:39:54.880 --> 2:39:57.880]  Nah, I feel bad for this guy. He's a young kid. He doesn't really understand.
[2:39:57.880 --> 2:40:00.880]  No, I understand, dude. I'm just joking around.
[2:40:00.880 --> 2:40:03.880]  But let's see. Let's interview.
[2:40:03.880 --> 2:40:07.880]  But they're calling Trump and everybody's a supporter racist, so they're trying to shout us down. I want to let them know they're here.
[2:40:07.880 --> 2:40:09.880]  You're live on the air right now.
[2:40:09.880 --> 2:40:11.880]  I am Vincent Perez. Nice to meet you.
[2:40:11.880 --> 2:40:14.880]  Nice to meet you, Vincent. So why are you here and what do you hope to gain out of all this?
[2:40:14.880 --> 2:40:22.880]  I'm here to make sure that, number one, that we get our message across, that we are trying to keep the love and respect in our communities
[2:40:22.880 --> 2:40:24.880]  and try to make sure people aren't being honest.
[2:40:24.880 --> 2:40:29.880]  So ask them about Mexico having its own wall and stronger rules than we do.
[2:40:29.880 --> 2:40:31.880]  Why is Mexico allowed to have a wall?
[2:40:31.880 --> 2:40:34.880]  Do you know what happens if you're caught when you go to Mexico illegally?
[2:40:34.880 --> 2:40:37.880]  No, I haven't got really a whole lot of ideas.
[2:40:37.880 --> 2:40:40.880]  They've already imprisoned for a year, hard labor.
[2:40:40.880 --> 2:40:41.880]  What's your point?
[2:40:41.880 --> 2:40:44.880]  Well, that's why we have borders. We were talking earlier about borders, right?
[2:40:44.880 --> 2:40:46.880]  And why we have borders.
[2:40:46.880 --> 2:40:54.880]  And if you just let everybody come in, then eventually it's going to tax the people that are actually paying taxes, paying for the resources that are going,
[2:40:54.880 --> 2:40:58.880]  like your parents are doing and your parents' parents did, built this country.
[2:40:58.880 --> 2:41:00.880]  You notice that the toll road...
[2:41:00.880 --> 2:41:04.880]  Hey, dude, talk to the girl that's Gaga. Now, do this married lady. You can't have him.
[2:41:04.880 --> 2:41:06.880]  But talk to the 18-year-old girl.
[2:41:06.880 --> 2:41:08.880]  All right.
[2:41:08.880 --> 2:41:10.880]  See that? We're not right there. Talk to her.
[2:41:10.880 --> 2:41:12.880]  There's a railroad on them.
[2:41:12.880 --> 2:41:14.880]  Hey, dude, talk to the brunette.
[2:41:14.880 --> 2:41:19.880]  My point is, though, they were built by federal money, and then they're taken by private companies, some of which are multinational companies.
[2:41:19.880 --> 2:41:21.880]  Mexico is actually having a lot of issues.
[2:41:21.880 --> 2:41:23.880]  Yeah, they're owned by Spain, brother.
[2:41:23.880 --> 2:41:25.880]  So, like, you can buy and do a joke.
[2:41:25.880 --> 2:41:27.880]  Well, right, but we have to spread our...
[2:41:27.880 --> 2:41:29.880]  Talk to the girl, dude. Talk to the girl.
[2:41:29.880 --> 2:41:30.880]  Just not necessarily...
[2:41:30.880 --> 2:41:31.880]  Ask her why she's there.
[2:41:31.880 --> 2:41:34.880]  When Mexico is not a government that people have...
[2:41:34.880 --> 2:41:36.880]  I don't know if you can hear me.
[2:41:36.880 --> 2:41:38.880]  I can hear you. So, why are you here?
[2:41:38.880 --> 2:41:44.880]  It's just the same. I have a discomfort with, I guess, Trump in particular. That is what I'm here for.
[2:41:44.880 --> 2:41:49.880]  And it's just making sure that I can illustrate that in a peaceful way.
[2:41:49.880 --> 2:41:55.880]  I'm not, you know, I'm not looking to seek out anyone there, you know, and I don't want to shout at them, and I'm not going to assume, you know...
[2:41:55.880 --> 2:41:59.880]  I have my information and my beliefs that might be wrong, too.
[2:41:59.880 --> 2:42:03.880]  So, I'm just kind of a part of everything going on.
[2:42:03.880 --> 2:42:07.880]  So, you don't have... You're not strong one way or another. You just decided to come out here?
[2:42:07.880 --> 2:42:12.880]  No, I mean, I am strongly against Trump. That is why I am here. It is to show that discomfort.
[2:42:12.880 --> 2:42:15.880]  I just want to do it in a peaceful fashion so that...
[2:42:15.880 --> 2:42:17.880]  And I'm not shouting...
[2:42:17.880 --> 2:42:18.880]  Ask her why she doesn't like Trump.
[2:42:18.880 --> 2:42:23.880]  I want to be a part of the whole against Trump without, you know, kind of helping...
[2:42:23.880 --> 2:42:25.880]  So, what's your biggest beef with Trump?
[2:42:25.880 --> 2:42:28.880]  To me, it's just...
[2:42:28.880 --> 2:42:34.880]  It's kind of nerve-wracking to see the way, like, you wanted to do our nasty portations, and I understand that.
[2:42:34.880 --> 2:42:40.880]  Just when I was hearing things like the wall he wanted to build, and even maybe labeling Muslims publicly,
[2:42:40.880 --> 2:42:42.880]  where they need an idea of some sort...
[2:42:42.880 --> 2:42:45.880]  Ask her if she knows that most Muslim countries yet wear a hood over her head.
[2:42:45.880 --> 2:42:47.880]  A lot of his policies might be a little too strong.
[2:42:47.880 --> 2:42:49.880]  Ask her if she's ever been to a Muslim country.
[2:42:49.880 --> 2:42:50.880]  That practical.
[2:42:50.880 --> 2:42:52.880]  Have you ever been to a Muslim country?
[2:42:52.880 --> 2:42:53.880]  No.
[2:42:53.880 --> 2:42:55.880]  You would have to wear a hood over your head if you were there.
[2:42:55.880 --> 2:42:56.880]  You don't have to.
[2:42:56.880 --> 2:42:57.880]  It's actually a choice.
[2:42:57.880 --> 2:42:59.880]  You don't have to. They'll just kill you if you don't.
[2:42:59.880 --> 2:43:06.880]  Ask that woman with a feminist shirt behind her if she wants one or a bigger pursuit.
[2:43:06.880 --> 2:43:10.880]  I think in Qatar you can't either, and Bahrain...
[2:43:10.880 --> 2:43:14.880]  There's plenty of countries there. If you don't, they have a big problem with that.
[2:43:14.880 --> 2:43:18.880]  This is live coverage at Jamesville, Wisconsin.
[2:43:18.880 --> 2:43:20.880]  You're seeing the face of the...
[2:43:20.880 --> 2:43:21.880]  I got a guy hitting on me.
[2:43:21.880 --> 2:43:23.880]  Beautiful losers.
[2:43:23.880 --> 2:43:29.880]  There are a lot of times in Muslim history that have been very reasonable...
[2:43:29.880 --> 2:43:31.880]  Yeah, well, this ain't it, brother.
[2:43:31.880 --> 2:43:32.880] ...to wear burqas, in fact.
[2:43:32.880 --> 2:43:34.880]  Not since Saudi Arabia haunched out it.
[2:43:34.880 --> 2:43:37.880]  There was a lot of history regarding actually a lot of...
[2:43:37.880 --> 2:43:39.880]  Well, actually we got a time machine because we...
[2:43:39.880 --> 2:43:42.880]  We don't want to go back to the Inquisition either, you know?
[2:43:42.880 --> 2:43:47.880]  All Muslims make all women wear burqas. It's actually a contentious debate.
[2:43:47.880 --> 2:43:48.880]  There's a lot of...
[2:43:48.880 --> 2:43:50.880]  Well, they say white people blow up Oklahoma City.
[2:43:50.880 --> 2:43:53.880]  It comes from people who wear the burqa instead of the niqab.
[2:43:53.880 --> 2:43:57.880]  There are some people who, like, see that as too conservative.
[2:43:57.880 --> 2:43:58.880]  It's just like our politics.
[2:43:58.880 --> 2:44:01.880]  Like, some of those who wear the full headdress...
[2:44:01.880 --> 2:44:03.880]  Tell them that the Aztecs is human sacrifice.
[2:44:03.880 --> 2:44:05.880]  Is this any culture the same?
[2:44:05.880 --> 2:44:08.880]  Other than gun owner culture, that's got to be dealt with.
[2:44:08.880 --> 2:44:10.880]  All right, I asked her if she's got anything else.
[2:44:10.880 --> 2:44:11.880]  This guy said moron.
[2:44:11.880 --> 2:44:13.880]  What do you want me to ask?
[2:44:13.880 --> 2:44:16.880]  No, just tell them. Ask him if he likes drinking fluoride.
[2:44:16.880 --> 2:44:17.880]  All right, all right.
[2:44:17.880 --> 2:44:19.880]  What do you think of fluoride in the water supply?
[2:44:19.880 --> 2:44:21.880]  Fluoride in the water supply?
[2:44:21.880 --> 2:44:26.880]  I think it's a signal that our government needs to be paying a little bit more attention
[2:44:26.880 --> 2:44:29.880]  to the safety of all communities,
[2:44:29.880 --> 2:44:34.880]  and especially the poor ones who cannot afford all of the infrastructure.
[2:44:34.880 --> 2:44:36.880]  So if fluoride's so good for your teeth, why do they...
[2:44:36.880 --> 2:44:38.880]  If fluoride's to help you.
[2:44:38.880 --> 2:44:40.880]  If fluoride's so good for your teeth, why do they want you to drink it?
[2:44:40.880 --> 2:44:42.880]  It's helpless idiots, man.
[2:44:42.880 --> 2:44:44.880]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[2:44:44.880 --> 2:44:46.880]  Fluoride in the water. They say it's for your teeth.
[2:44:46.880 --> 2:44:48.880]  Fluoride. Right. Yes, yes.
[2:44:48.880 --> 2:44:50.880]  What do you mean? Why...
[2:44:50.880 --> 2:44:52.880]  What do you mean, why is it so good to drink it?
[2:44:52.880 --> 2:44:54.880]  I'm a biochemist, so I actually have a lot of...
[2:44:54.880 --> 2:44:55.880]  Oh, you're a biochemist?
[2:44:55.880 --> 2:44:56.880]  I've interviewed biochemists.
[2:44:56.880 --> 2:44:59.880]  As you know, is hydrofluorosalicylic acid or sodium fluoride?
[2:44:59.880 --> 2:45:04.880]  Something they believed was helpful to our health, much like a lot of...
[2:45:04.880 --> 2:45:06.880]  So do you know what hydrofluorosalicylic acid is?
[2:45:06.880 --> 2:45:09.880]  Do you know, like, dihydrogen, but not excited?
[2:45:09.880 --> 2:45:10.880]  Yeah, sure. That's water, punk.
[2:45:10.880 --> 2:45:13.880]  Hydrofluorosalicylic acid is what the fluoride that they call,
[2:45:13.880 --> 2:45:15.880]  what they put in our water supply,
[2:45:15.880 --> 2:45:17.880]  and it comes from the byproducts of fertilizer manufacturing.
[2:45:17.880 --> 2:45:19.880]  Sure. So, like...
[2:45:19.880 --> 2:45:20.880]  It's toxic waste, weasel.
[2:45:20.880 --> 2:45:21.880]  It's good for your teeth.
[2:45:21.880 --> 2:45:23.880]  Yeah, so it doesn't really... What's your point?
[2:45:23.880 --> 2:45:25.880]  No, even the feds have said take it out, Jackass.
[2:45:25.880 --> 2:45:27.880]  That do that also tell you that you should...
[2:45:27.880 --> 2:45:29.880]  that Trump is racist, Trump is xenophobic.
[2:45:29.880 --> 2:45:31.880]  It's the same talking points that are going,
[2:45:31.880 --> 2:45:33.880]  yeah, it is, it's the same people.
[2:45:33.880 --> 2:45:34.880]  That's not... Yeah.
[2:45:34.880 --> 2:45:38.880]  Are you arguing that, like, complicated sounding chemicals
[2:45:38.880 --> 2:45:40.880]  are things you shouldn't eat?
[2:45:40.880 --> 2:45:41.880]  No.
[2:45:41.880 --> 2:45:44.880]  I'm arguing that you should not put hydrofluorosalicylic acid
[2:45:44.880 --> 2:45:46.880]  into your body saying it's good for your teeth.
[2:45:46.880 --> 2:45:49.880]  Just because it has to do with the chemical and...
[2:45:49.880 --> 2:45:52.880]  No, now even the American Dental Association
[2:45:52.880 --> 2:45:53.880]  says take it out.
[2:45:53.880 --> 2:45:56.880]  No, there's plenty of people that say it causes brain damage
[2:45:56.880 --> 2:45:57.880]  and IQ... Harvard, Harvard!
[2:45:57.880 --> 2:45:59.880] ...that you bring up the farm, like, specifically.
[2:45:59.880 --> 2:46:01.880]  You got it, like, it's like, if that's so,
[2:46:01.880 --> 2:46:03.880]  that's just a product of health research.
[2:46:03.880 --> 2:46:05.880]  We do not always know everything at once.
[2:46:05.880 --> 2:46:07.880]  Oh, they knew, they knew, brother.
[2:46:07.880 --> 2:46:08.880]  All right, enough of this guy.
[2:46:08.880 --> 2:46:10.880]  Go show us some more stuff.
[2:46:10.880 --> 2:46:11.880]  Enough of this guy.
[2:46:11.880 --> 2:46:12.880]  You should have it removed.
[2:46:12.880 --> 2:46:13.880]  But...
[2:46:13.880 --> 2:46:14.880]  Thanks for talking with me, brother.
[2:46:14.880 --> 2:46:16.880]  All right, let's go talk to somebody else.
[2:46:16.880 --> 2:46:18.880]  Hey, give us a pan of the entire group.
[2:46:18.880 --> 2:46:20.880]  Give us a pan of the police, everything.
[2:46:20.880 --> 2:46:22.880]  Show us where Trump's going to be speaking.
[2:46:22.880 --> 2:46:25.880]  These folks stormed the hotel yesterday
[2:46:25.880 --> 2:46:27.880]  once you have more arrested.
[2:46:27.880 --> 2:46:30.880]  In fact, one of the guys who was arrested is back out.
[2:46:30.880 --> 2:46:33.880]  We saw him earlier in the middle of the crowd.
[2:46:33.880 --> 2:46:34.880]  Bigotry is the enemy.
[2:46:34.880 --> 2:46:36.880]  These people just want to feel good, hate everybody.
[2:46:36.880 --> 2:46:38.880]  Dude, you want to go march through the crowd
[2:46:38.880 --> 2:46:40.880]  back at the back, maybe?
[2:46:40.880 --> 2:46:43.880]  Yeah, we probably have to go around over...
[2:46:43.880 --> 2:46:46.880]  Hey, go over and talk to that guy.
[2:46:46.880 --> 2:46:47.880]  What's that?
[2:46:47.880 --> 2:46:48.880]  No, no, dude, dude.
[2:46:48.880 --> 2:46:50.880]  Go the other way.
[2:46:50.880 --> 2:46:52.880]  Go try to find that minder that was telling you
[2:46:52.880 --> 2:46:54.880]  you didn't have any free speech.
[2:46:54.880 --> 2:46:56.880]  Where is she? Right there in front of you?
[2:46:56.880 --> 2:46:58.880]  Ask her her views.
[2:46:58.880 --> 2:47:00.880]  She's in a public protest.
[2:47:00.880 --> 2:47:01.880]  All right.
[2:47:01.880 --> 2:47:03.880]  Again, we're not being mean to them folks.
[2:47:03.880 --> 2:47:05.880]  They're storming the event and stuff.
[2:47:05.880 --> 2:47:07.880]  These groups have been Soros funded, Hillary funded.
[2:47:07.880 --> 2:47:09.880]  They've been caught by the valley.
[2:47:09.880 --> 2:47:10.880]  Let's talk to this moron.
[2:47:10.880 --> 2:47:13.880]  No, hate in our state.
[2:47:13.880 --> 2:47:15.880]  No, hate in our state.
[2:47:15.880 --> 2:47:17.880]  I don't think she's going to talk.
[2:47:17.880 --> 2:47:19.880]  Let's hear her. She's so intellectual.
[2:47:19.880 --> 2:47:20.880]  No, hate in our state.
[2:47:20.880 --> 2:47:21.880]  That woman is smart, man.
[2:47:21.880 --> 2:47:23.880]  She's an empowered woman. Look at her.
[2:47:23.880 --> 2:47:24.880]  No, hate in our state.
[2:47:24.880 --> 2:47:26.880]  I can tell you a little bit about myself if you want.
[2:47:26.880 --> 2:47:27.880]  Sure.
[2:47:27.880 --> 2:47:30.880]  A lot of people have been like GM and other companies
[2:47:30.880 --> 2:47:32.880]  that have left this area and taken away a lot of the jobs,
[2:47:32.880 --> 2:47:34.880]  which is why you have a lot of disenfranchised people
[2:47:34.880 --> 2:47:36.880]  instead of blaming Donald Trump for it,
[2:47:36.880 --> 2:47:38.880]  who's actually employed people.
[2:47:38.880 --> 2:47:41.880]  I'm here as a white woman and a mother of two white sons,
[2:47:41.880 --> 2:47:43.880]  and I don't want to raise my sons in a world shaped
[2:47:43.880 --> 2:47:44.880]  by racism and violence.
[2:47:44.880 --> 2:47:46.880]  And that's the kind of message that Donald Trump
[2:47:46.880 --> 2:47:49.880]  has used to empower himself into space.
[2:47:49.880 --> 2:47:51.880]  Ask her if she knows about tribalism and other groups
[2:47:51.880 --> 2:47:53.880]  and if she understands why we have nationalism.
[2:47:53.880 --> 2:47:55.880]  And I absolutely do not want my family or my sons
[2:47:55.880 --> 2:47:57.880]  as white people to...
[2:47:57.880 --> 2:47:59.880]  As white people, as bad people.
[2:47:59.880 --> 2:48:03.880] ...where white people are manipulated into being divided from our neighbors.
[2:48:03.880 --> 2:48:05.880]  Ask her if she thinks white people are the problem,
[2:48:05.880 --> 2:48:07.880]  historically, if other people are tribal.
[2:48:07.880 --> 2:48:09.880]  So you think white people are the main problem?
[2:48:09.880 --> 2:48:10.880]  No, I do not.
[2:48:10.880 --> 2:48:12.880]  I don't think I'm the main problem,
[2:48:12.880 --> 2:48:14.880]  but I absolutely am if I'm silent.
[2:48:14.880 --> 2:48:15.880]  I will not be silent.
[2:48:15.880 --> 2:48:16.880]  Well, tell her more.
[2:48:16.880 --> 2:48:18.880]  Tell us more about how other people aren't tribal.
[2:48:18.880 --> 2:48:21.880]  I think she's done.
[2:48:21.880 --> 2:48:23.880]  No, no, let her keep going.
[2:48:23.880 --> 2:48:25.880]  Let's hear the little commie chance and the idiot chance.
[2:48:25.880 --> 2:48:27.880]  I mean, dude, this is pathetic.
[2:48:27.880 --> 2:48:30.880]  I don't get these votes.
[2:48:30.880 --> 2:48:31.880]  Who?
[2:48:31.880 --> 2:48:32.880]  I.
[2:48:32.880 --> 2:48:33.880]  Who?
[2:48:33.880 --> 2:48:34.880]  I.
[2:48:34.880 --> 2:48:37.880]  It has to be...
[2:48:37.880 --> 2:48:38.880]  Who?
[2:48:38.880 --> 2:48:39.880]  Who?
[2:48:39.880 --> 2:48:40.880]  And, uh, but that's about it.
[2:48:40.880 --> 2:48:41.880]  It hasn't been too much.
[2:48:41.880 --> 2:48:43.880]  There's some people talking in between the fence over here.
[2:48:43.880 --> 2:48:46.880]  Alex, there's a fence keeping the protesters apart
[2:48:46.880 --> 2:48:48.880]  with about a five-foot barrier.
[2:48:48.880 --> 2:48:51.880]  And so there has been some talk back and forth earlier today.
[2:48:51.880 --> 2:48:54.880]  It's definitely grown a little more divided as it's gone on.
[2:48:54.880 --> 2:48:56.880]  And I think it's probably going to beef up
[2:48:56.880 --> 2:48:57.880]  as soon as Donald gets here about...
[2:48:57.880 --> 2:49:00.880]  Hey, do you think we ought to go talk to some of the Donald Trump supporters?
[2:49:00.880 --> 2:49:03.880]  Hey, you want to interview the Easter Bunny?
[2:49:03.880 --> 2:49:06.880]  You're going to love this one, Alex.
[2:49:06.880 --> 2:49:08.880]  And I think he's a fan.
[2:49:08.880 --> 2:49:10.880]  All right, go back and talk to that guy.
[2:49:10.880 --> 2:49:11.880]  He's like a security guard.
[2:49:11.880 --> 2:49:13.880]  Oh, no, you got to meet the Easter Bunny.
[2:49:13.880 --> 2:49:16.880]  All right, we're live on TV.
[2:49:16.880 --> 2:49:18.880]  So tell us why you're here.
[2:49:18.880 --> 2:49:22.880]  Well, I'm here to see the side of a sanity here.
[2:49:22.880 --> 2:49:24.880]  I wanted to see how many Democrats were around
[2:49:24.880 --> 2:49:28.880]  and how many people were, like, for real going to vote for Trump.
[2:49:28.880 --> 2:49:29.880]  Yeah, yeah.
[2:49:29.880 --> 2:49:32.880]  So what's your impression of what you see right now?
[2:49:32.880 --> 2:49:35.880]  I don't know. It's pretty peaceful.
[2:49:35.880 --> 2:49:38.880]  I saw some people trying to instigate earlier.
[2:49:38.880 --> 2:49:42.880]  It was people from Trump's camp, but, you know, nobody's falling for it.
[2:49:42.880 --> 2:49:43.880]  Ask him who's ever taken LSD.
[2:49:43.880 --> 2:49:46.880]  I think Trump people are the problem. Trump supporters.
[2:49:46.880 --> 2:49:53.880]  No, I mean, I just think they don't know what's going on.
[2:49:53.880 --> 2:49:57.880]  I mean, I really don't understand how you could be behind that
[2:49:57.880 --> 2:50:02.880]  and sell the presidency and support half of the garbage that he took.
[2:50:02.880 --> 2:50:04.880]  Hey, ask him why the power elite worldwide
[2:50:04.880 --> 2:50:06.880]  and the Communist Chinese are investing.
[2:50:06.880 --> 2:50:07.880]  You see it from both sides.
[2:50:07.880 --> 2:50:09.880]  You see the Republicans and the Democrats hate him.
[2:50:09.880 --> 2:50:11.880]  Wouldn't that make you just want to pause for a second?
[2:50:11.880 --> 2:50:15.880]  Maybe this guy is talking some sense and some on, you know, several levels.
[2:50:15.880 --> 2:50:17.880]  No, he's not speaking.
[2:50:17.880 --> 2:50:19.880]  Ask this guy what he thinks of the Manson family.
[2:50:19.880 --> 2:50:22.880]  Actually, I have a conspiracy theory that Hillary paid him to run
[2:50:22.880 --> 2:50:25.880]  just because months ago it was a joke.
[2:50:25.880 --> 2:50:27.880]  That's what I thought a year ago.
[2:50:27.880 --> 2:50:28.880]  To talk. Yeah, you know what?
[2:50:28.880 --> 2:50:29.880]  Actually, we thought that too.
[2:50:29.880 --> 2:50:32.880]  But he has brought out her husband's sex campaigns,
[2:50:32.880 --> 2:50:35.880]  which I think is pretty damaging to what she's doing right now.
[2:50:35.880 --> 2:50:37.880]  Well, yeah, I suppose so.
[2:50:37.880 --> 2:50:39.880]  I mean, I wouldn't vote.
[2:50:39.880 --> 2:50:41.880]  Ask him what he thinks of the Charlie Manson.
[2:50:41.880 --> 2:50:46.880]  Actually, when he started, it was sort of like a protest run.
[2:50:46.880 --> 2:50:49.880]  As a candidate, I think he was surprised at the number of people.
[2:50:49.880 --> 2:50:50.880]  Ask him what he thinks of the LSD in that outfit.
[2:50:50.880 --> 2:50:53.880]  I thought it was a joke. I really did.
[2:50:53.880 --> 2:50:58.880]  But Wisconsin, for example, obviously, there is a history here
[2:50:58.880 --> 2:51:01.880]  of people voting against their better interests.
[2:51:01.880 --> 2:51:05.880]  So Alex wants to know if you take LSD in that bunny suit
[2:51:05.880 --> 2:51:07.880]  and what you think of the Manson family.
[2:51:07.880 --> 2:51:10.880]  Who? Alex Jones. You're live right now.
[2:51:10.880 --> 2:51:12.880]  Oh, hey, Alex. How are you doing?
[2:51:12.880 --> 2:51:14.880]  Yeah, we're doing well.
[2:51:14.880 --> 2:51:15.880]  He said we're doing well.
[2:51:15.880 --> 2:51:17.880]  No, no, no, I'm not on drugs.
[2:51:17.880 --> 2:51:19.880]  And I know I'm not a Manson fan.
[2:51:19.880 --> 2:51:22.880]  Are you blind? What's your job? What do you do?
[2:51:22.880 --> 2:51:24.880]  I'm an artist. You're an artist? Yeah.
[2:51:24.880 --> 2:51:26.880]  Is that surprising? No, not at all.
[2:51:26.880 --> 2:51:27.880]  Show some of your signs.
[2:51:27.880 --> 2:51:28.880]  Let me ask him this.
[2:51:28.880 --> 2:51:29.880]  Who's more handsome?
[2:51:29.880 --> 2:51:32.880]  Emperor Palpatine or Darth Vader?
[2:51:32.880 --> 2:51:33.880]  My favorite Ben Franklin quote.
[2:51:33.880 --> 2:51:35.880]  Oh, yeah, he's got a Ben Franklin quote.
[2:51:35.880 --> 2:51:36.880]  All right. Who's more handsome?
[2:51:36.880 --> 2:51:40.880]  Emperor Palpatine or who was the other one?
[2:51:40.880 --> 2:51:41.880]  Who was the other one, Alex?
[2:51:41.880 --> 2:51:42.880]  Darth Vader.
[2:51:42.880 --> 2:51:43.880]  Oh, who's more handsome?
[2:51:43.880 --> 2:51:45.880]  Emperor Palpatine or Darth Vader?
[2:51:45.880 --> 2:51:47.880]  Alex Jones.
[2:51:47.880 --> 2:51:49.880]  You won, Alex.
[2:51:49.880 --> 2:51:51.880]  Oh, my gosh. This is ridiculous.
[2:51:51.880 --> 2:51:52.880]  Hey, ask him this.
[2:51:52.880 --> 2:51:54.880]  Doesn't he see that Trump is a populist manifestation,
[2:51:54.880 --> 2:51:55.880]  just like Sanders is?
[2:51:55.880 --> 2:51:57.880]  Whether you support him or not,
[2:51:57.880 --> 2:51:58.880]  the power structures against him.
[2:51:58.880 --> 2:51:59.880]  All right.
[2:51:59.880 --> 2:52:01.880]  I kind of asked him that before.
[2:52:01.880 --> 2:52:04.880]  So right now it looks like there's a left
[2:52:04.880 --> 2:52:06.880]  and a right populist candidate.
[2:52:06.880 --> 2:52:07.880]  We got Trump and Sanders.
[2:52:07.880 --> 2:52:08.880]  Sure.
[2:52:08.880 --> 2:52:09.880]  Why do you think that is?
[2:52:09.880 --> 2:52:10.880]  You let me know.
[2:52:10.880 --> 2:52:11.880]  Why do you think that is?
[2:52:11.880 --> 2:52:12.880]  Well, I don't know.
[2:52:12.880 --> 2:52:14.880]  This was the first election in a long time
[2:52:14.880 --> 2:52:16.880]  where there's been a full swing of the pendulum.
[2:52:16.880 --> 2:52:19.880]  You know, we had eight years
[2:52:19.880 --> 2:52:21.880]  of the far right with Bush,
[2:52:21.880 --> 2:52:24.880]  the Bush dynasty continuing.
[2:52:24.880 --> 2:52:28.880]  And, you know, I'm sorry,
[2:52:28.880 --> 2:52:30.880]  but I kind of think that our president administration
[2:52:30.880 --> 2:52:32.880]  is very centrist at best.
[2:52:32.880 --> 2:52:34.880]  There were a lot of things.
[2:52:34.880 --> 2:52:36.880]  There were a lot of things that the president,
[2:52:36.880 --> 2:52:38.880]  President Obama could have done.
[2:52:38.880 --> 2:52:40.880]  He should have done and he didn't.
[2:52:40.880 --> 2:52:42.880]  He played it safe, you know?
[2:52:42.880 --> 2:52:45.880]  And I get like droning kids.
[2:52:45.880 --> 2:52:46.880]  All right.
[2:52:46.880 --> 2:52:47.880]  Good.
[2:52:47.880 --> 2:52:49.880]  Go talk to the guy on the red shirt.
[2:52:49.880 --> 2:52:51.880]  There's a guy on camo back behind it.
[2:52:51.880 --> 2:52:52.880]  Let's talk to them.
[2:52:52.880 --> 2:52:53.880]  Over there.
[2:52:53.880 --> 2:52:54.880]  All right.
[2:52:54.880 --> 2:52:55.880]  Over there and over there.
[2:52:55.880 --> 2:52:56.880]  Let's see if you can see me right now.
[2:52:56.880 --> 2:52:58.880]  This is live coverage of the pendulum going on
[2:52:58.880 --> 2:53:01.880]  at the Donald Trump rally in Jamesville, Wisconsin.
[2:53:01.880 --> 2:53:03.880]  Talk to that froy line right there.
[2:53:03.880 --> 2:53:05.880]  The woman behind you, Dave.
[2:53:05.880 --> 2:53:06.880]  I think we're about to lose battery,
[2:53:06.880 --> 2:53:07.880]  but we'll go until we...
[2:53:07.880 --> 2:53:10.880]  Hey, do you want to tell me why you're here?
[2:53:10.880 --> 2:53:12.880]  To protest.
[2:53:12.880 --> 2:53:13.880]  Yeah.
[2:53:13.880 --> 2:53:14.880]  You know who you're protesting?
[2:53:14.880 --> 2:53:15.880]  Trump.
[2:53:15.880 --> 2:53:16.880]  Why?
[2:53:16.880 --> 2:53:18.880]  Because he's an asshole.
[2:53:18.880 --> 2:53:19.880]  Oh.
[2:53:19.880 --> 2:53:20.880]  I hope y'all bleep that.
[2:53:20.880 --> 2:53:21.880]  No, that's okay.
[2:53:21.880 --> 2:53:22.880]  She would say that.
[2:53:22.880 --> 2:53:23.880]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[2:53:23.880 --> 2:53:24.880]  That's all right.
[2:53:24.880 --> 2:53:25.880]  So why is he bad?
[2:53:25.880 --> 2:53:27.880]  Just the mainstream media that tells you stuff?
[2:53:27.880 --> 2:53:29.880]  Tell me why he's bad.
[2:53:29.880 --> 2:53:31.880]  He's racist.
[2:53:31.880 --> 2:53:33.880]  That's what everybody said today.
[2:53:33.880 --> 2:53:34.880]  Everybody says he's racist.
[2:53:34.880 --> 2:53:35.880]  Same media that tells you about lottery tickets
[2:53:35.880 --> 2:53:37.880]  tells you that.
[2:53:37.880 --> 2:53:40.880]  He employs people?
[2:53:40.880 --> 2:53:45.880]  I think he's a lot better of a person to answer your question.
[2:53:45.880 --> 2:53:46.880]  We can't talk to you.
[2:53:46.880 --> 2:53:48.880]  There's some intellectual shit to talk to you.
[2:53:48.880 --> 2:53:49.880]  Her handler doesn't want to talk to you.
[2:53:49.880 --> 2:53:50.880]  We're not going to protest to be on national media.
[2:53:50.880 --> 2:53:51.880]  I think you're an asshole.
[2:53:51.880 --> 2:53:52.880]  It's acting cool right now.
[2:53:52.880 --> 2:53:53.880]  It's for my Facebook to look at an election right now.
[2:53:53.880 --> 2:53:54.880]  You're the one that said don't talk to her,
[2:53:54.880 --> 2:53:55.880]  and I'm bad.
[2:53:55.880 --> 2:53:56.880]  You're a good fox, man.
[2:53:56.880 --> 2:53:57.880]  All right.
[2:53:57.880 --> 2:53:58.880]  We're going to make our way into the crowd.
[2:53:58.880 --> 2:53:59.880]  Let's see what goes on here.
[2:53:59.880 --> 2:54:00.880]  We're going to go until the battery dies.
[2:54:00.880 --> 2:54:01.880]  Turn this way, kid.
[2:54:01.880 --> 2:54:02.880]  Turn this way.
[2:54:02.880 --> 2:54:03.880]  Hey, what's up?
[2:54:03.880 --> 2:54:04.880]  Oh, turn this way.
[2:54:04.880 --> 2:54:05.880]  Turn this way.
[2:54:05.880 --> 2:54:06.880]  We don't care.
[2:54:06.880 --> 2:54:07.880]  Hey, bud.
[2:54:07.880 --> 2:54:08.880]  What's up?
[2:54:08.880 --> 2:54:09.880]  Trump.
[2:54:09.880 --> 2:54:10.880]  We don't need to hate right now.
[2:54:10.880 --> 2:54:15.880]  Why do you think he's hating?
[2:54:15.880 --> 2:54:16.880]  Because Obama is just not getting his back.
[2:54:16.880 --> 2:54:17.880]  You know, I don't know.
[2:54:17.880 --> 2:54:18.880]  Because who?
[2:54:18.880 --> 2:54:19.880]  Obama is just not getting his country back right.
[2:54:19.880 --> 2:54:20.880]  You think so?
[2:54:20.880 --> 2:54:21.880]  Yeah.
[2:54:21.880 --> 2:54:22.880]  You think the economy is doing better now?
[2:54:22.880 --> 2:54:23.880]  Look at this.
[2:54:23.880 --> 2:54:24.880]  I don't know.
[2:54:24.880 --> 2:54:25.880]  You think the economy is doing better?
[2:54:25.880 --> 2:54:26.880]  You tell me this statistic.
[2:54:26.880 --> 2:54:27.880]  Look at this.
[2:54:27.880 --> 2:54:28.880]  What's the unemployment rate?
[2:54:28.880 --> 2:54:29.880]  He's going to come back on.
[2:54:29.880 --> 2:54:30.880]  You know the unemployment rate for black people
[2:54:30.880 --> 2:54:31.880]  is double what it used to be.
[2:54:31.880 --> 2:54:32.880]  Under Obama.
[2:54:32.880 --> 2:54:33.880]  But guess what?
[2:54:33.880 --> 2:54:34.880]  Obama is having to cut the gas prices going down.
[2:54:34.880 --> 2:54:35.880]  Where does that start to be that low?
[2:54:35.880 --> 2:54:40.880]  I think it has to do more with the price of oil from Saudi Arabia.
[2:54:40.880 --> 2:54:41.880]  They're cutting production.
[2:54:41.880 --> 2:54:42.880]  I mean, you...
[2:54:42.880 --> 2:54:43.880]  Increasing production.
[2:54:43.880 --> 2:54:44.880]  So Obama ain't helping.
[2:54:44.880 --> 2:54:45.880]  They're increasing.
[2:54:45.880 --> 2:54:46.880]  Is Obama helping or not?
[2:54:46.880 --> 2:54:47.880]  Did he help?
[2:54:47.880 --> 2:54:48.880]  Did he change?
[2:54:48.880 --> 2:54:49.880]  Did he do better?
[2:54:49.880 --> 2:54:50.880]  No.
[2:54:50.880 --> 2:54:51.880]  I don't think he was trying to make it.
[2:54:51.880 --> 2:54:52.880]  I don't think he was trying to help at all.
[2:54:52.880 --> 2:54:53.880]  He just wanted to be on TV.
[2:54:53.880 --> 2:54:54.880]  What do you think?
[2:54:54.880 --> 2:54:55.880]  I don't know.
[2:54:55.880 --> 2:54:56.880]  We're not listening.
[2:54:56.880 --> 2:55:01.880]  I think he finds a list every day and they bomb people with drones.
[2:55:01.880 --> 2:55:06.880]  And he does it... they kill families, they kill wedding parties, they kill children.
[2:55:06.880 --> 2:55:08.880]  Have you seen the children that have been killed by drones?
[2:55:08.880 --> 2:55:09.880]  You're in the right country.
[2:55:09.880 --> 2:55:10.880]  You're in America.
[2:55:10.880 --> 2:55:11.880]  So it's your opinion.
[2:55:11.880 --> 2:55:12.880]  It's my opinion, you know.
[2:55:12.880 --> 2:55:13.880]  Oh, no.
[2:55:13.880 --> 2:55:14.880]  No, no.
[2:55:14.880 --> 2:55:15.880]  Our government funded ISIS.
[2:55:15.880 --> 2:55:18.880]  Whatever you think it will matter to me, I know Trump don't need to be in the office.
[2:55:18.880 --> 2:55:19.880]  What do you think it...
[2:55:19.880 --> 2:55:20.880]  Hey, what's that horn?
[2:55:20.880 --> 2:55:21.880]  Hey, dude.
[2:55:21.880 --> 2:55:22.880]  Dude, dude, dude.
[2:55:22.880 --> 2:55:23.880]  Tell them thank you.
[2:55:23.880 --> 2:55:24.880]  I want to hear this horn.
[2:55:24.880 --> 2:55:25.880]  Who's blowing the horn?
[2:55:25.880 --> 2:55:26.880]  There's a...
[2:55:26.880 --> 2:55:28.880]  Dude, that's enough.
[2:55:28.880 --> 2:55:31.880]  I want to go talk to those people down there.
[2:55:31.880 --> 2:55:32.880]  The hornblowers?
[2:55:32.880 --> 2:55:33.880]  Yes.
[2:55:33.880 --> 2:55:34.880]  Let's go talk to the hornblowers.
[2:55:34.880 --> 2:55:35.880]  All right.
[2:55:35.880 --> 2:55:36.880]  Let's get to it.
[2:55:36.880 --> 2:55:41.880]  Folks, this is all brought to you by InfowarsLive.com and Hillary for Prison Shirts because Benghazi
[2:55:41.880 --> 2:55:44.880]  and Fast and Furious are reasons for it.
[2:55:44.880 --> 2:55:47.880]  Take action today and fund the tip of the spear in the info or your financing do wallowing
[2:55:47.880 --> 2:55:48.880]  around with these people.
[2:55:48.880 --> 2:55:50.880]  So how do you like hornblowing?
[2:55:50.880 --> 2:55:55.880]  Actually, I'm getting back in shape from my French horn days of high school.
[2:55:55.880 --> 2:55:56.880]  You're an old pro.
[2:55:56.880 --> 2:55:58.880]  I am an old pro, yes.
[2:55:58.880 --> 2:56:01.880]  So tell me why you hate Trump.
[2:56:01.880 --> 2:56:03.880]  He has no foreign policy.
[2:56:03.880 --> 2:56:06.880]  He absolutely hates women.
[2:56:06.880 --> 2:56:08.880]  If everybody who...
[2:56:08.880 --> 2:56:10.880]  Yeah, he was against funding ISIS.
[2:56:10.880 --> 2:56:12.880]  He treated the journalists with a handicap.
[2:56:12.880 --> 2:56:13.880]  He doesn't want to work with Russia for no reason.
[2:56:13.880 --> 2:56:15.880]  If anyone who's handicapped in their life...
[2:56:15.880 --> 2:56:16.880]  What are these people saying?
[2:56:16.880 --> 2:56:17.880]  We don't know much of...
[2:56:17.880 --> 2:56:25.880]  If anyone in their life, if anyone knows somebody of first generation Mexican or other immigrant
[2:56:25.880 --> 2:56:29.880]  country, you know, how can you possibly support this man?
[2:56:29.880 --> 2:56:34.880]  He has no policies that make any concrete sense.
[2:56:34.880 --> 2:56:36.880]  He doesn't know what he's doing.
[2:56:36.880 --> 2:56:39.880]  Ask this lady why countries are allowed to have borders but we can't.
[2:56:39.880 --> 2:56:42.880]  Why can't we have borders when everybody else can?
[2:56:42.880 --> 2:56:43.880]  You put a 7 point plan out.
[2:56:43.880 --> 2:56:45.880]  Why can't we have borders?
[2:56:45.880 --> 2:56:47.880]  Ask her if she has a door on her house.
[2:56:47.880 --> 2:56:49.880]  Are you on Obamacare right now?
[2:56:49.880 --> 2:56:50.880]  No, I'm not.
[2:56:50.880 --> 2:56:52.880]  Ask her if she has a door on her house.
[2:56:52.880 --> 2:56:55.880]  Ask her if she has a door on her house.
[2:56:55.880 --> 2:56:58.880]  Does she have a door on her house?
[2:56:58.880 --> 2:57:00.880]  So we're live on TV right now.
[2:57:00.880 --> 2:57:02.880]  Alex wants to know if you have a door on your house.
[2:57:02.880 --> 2:57:04.880]  Do I have a door on my house?
[2:57:04.880 --> 2:57:05.880]  Of course I do.
[2:57:05.880 --> 2:57:06.880]  I have many doors on my house.
[2:57:06.880 --> 2:57:08.880]  Do you have a fence in your yard?
[2:57:08.880 --> 2:57:09.880]  I do not have a fence.
[2:57:09.880 --> 2:57:11.880]  She doesn't have a fence but she has a door.
[2:57:11.880 --> 2:57:12.880]  Yes, I do.
[2:57:12.880 --> 2:57:14.880]  The countries have to have doors.
[2:57:14.880 --> 2:57:16.880]  So a door keeps out uninvited people, right?
[2:57:16.880 --> 2:57:17.880]  Correct.
[2:57:17.880 --> 2:57:19.880]  And I have a large dog.
[2:57:19.880 --> 2:57:20.880]  Oh, a large dog?
[2:57:20.880 --> 2:57:21.880]  Yes.
[2:57:21.880 --> 2:57:23.880]  So that's essentially what a border is.
[2:57:23.880 --> 2:57:24.880]  Right, I understand that.
[2:57:24.880 --> 2:57:26.880]  How many of the people come over here
[2:57:26.880 --> 2:57:28.880]  are actually buying the causing power?
[2:57:28.880 --> 2:57:30.880]  I would say not the majority of them,
[2:57:30.880 --> 2:57:32.880]  but the ones that are, we need to deport.
[2:57:32.880 --> 2:57:37.880]  I believe in borders, but I do not believe in a wall.
[2:57:37.880 --> 2:57:39.880]  Well, Obama's gotten rid of it.
[2:57:39.880 --> 2:57:41.880]  The things that Donald Trump did.
[2:57:41.880 --> 2:57:42.880]  People are idiots, man.
[2:57:42.880 --> 2:57:45.880]  Obama is doing a good job at killing the border.
[2:57:45.880 --> 2:57:47.880]  As well as the fact that he has no...
[2:57:47.880 --> 2:57:48.880]  Oh, look, she's yelling at you.
[2:57:48.880 --> 2:57:49.880]  Look at this pea brain.
[2:57:49.880 --> 2:57:51.880]  You build a 10-foot wall,
[2:57:51.880 --> 2:57:54.880]  they're going to be selling 11-foot ladders.
[2:57:54.880 --> 2:57:56.880]  I think he just said it's going to get 10 feet higher.
[2:57:56.880 --> 2:57:57.880]  I don't want to stand on your sign.
[2:57:57.880 --> 2:57:59.880]  Then they're going to sell 21-foot ladders.
[2:57:59.880 --> 2:58:01.880]  Obviously, that's a stunt to say it.
[2:58:01.880 --> 2:58:03.880]  The point is you've got to have some border...
[2:58:03.880 --> 2:58:05.880]  That can be sold by a wall, even if it were a problem.
[2:58:05.880 --> 2:58:07.880]  We're not bordering Switzerland, lady.
[2:58:07.880 --> 2:58:09.880]  So you don't think...
[2:58:09.880 --> 2:58:11.880]  Come here illegally.
[2:58:11.880 --> 2:58:15.880]  Only 34% of the illegals that come here come here illegally.
[2:58:15.880 --> 2:58:16.880]  What?
[2:58:16.880 --> 2:58:17.880]  Yep.
[2:58:17.880 --> 2:58:19.880]  Ask her if I can go to Mexico illegally.
[2:58:19.880 --> 2:58:21.880]  Ask her if Mexico has walls.
[2:58:21.880 --> 2:58:22.880]  Well, what if I go to Mexico illegally?
[2:58:22.880 --> 2:58:23.880]  Are they going to accept me?
[2:58:23.880 --> 2:58:25.880]  Yeah, my staff just moved to Mexico eight months ago.
[2:58:25.880 --> 2:58:27.880]  You have to do it legally.
[2:58:27.880 --> 2:58:29.880]  We're going to be back in 70 seconds.
[2:58:29.880 --> 2:58:30.880]  We're going to keep rolling during the deal.
[2:58:30.880 --> 2:58:32.880]  Oh, so she says Mexico doesn't have a border.
[2:58:32.880 --> 2:58:34.880]  You heard her. You can just go there.
[2:58:34.880 --> 2:58:36.880]  Not true. Can't have babies for free.
[2:58:36.880 --> 2:58:38.880]  infowars.com
[2:58:38.880 --> 2:58:48.880]  Stay with us.
[2:59:23.880 --> 2:59:25.880]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while,
[2:59:25.880 --> 2:59:27.880]  but I probably could not have done it without Brainforce.
[2:59:27.880 --> 2:59:31.880]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep,
[2:59:31.880 --> 2:59:38.880]  got up, took two more Brainforce and came in.
[2:59:38.880 --> 2:59:40.880]  You will find Brainforce and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com
[2:59:40.880 --> 2:59:46.880]  or call 888-253-3139.
[2:59:46.880 --> 2:59:58.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:58.880 --> 3:00:03.880]  From the Frontlines.
[3:00:03.880 --> 3:00:09.880]  From the Frontlines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:09.880 --> 3:00:11.880]  Mother.
[3:00:11.880 --> 3:00:16.880]  Tell your children not to walk my way.
[3:00:16.880 --> 3:00:19.880]  Tell your children not to hear my words.
[3:00:19.880 --> 3:00:21.880]  What they mean, what they say.
[3:00:21.880 --> 3:00:23.880]  Mother.
[3:00:23.880 --> 3:00:26.880]  Mother.
[3:00:26.880 --> 3:00:30.880]  Can you keep them in the dark for life?
[3:00:30.880 --> 3:00:37.880]  Can you hide them from the weighted world?
[3:00:37.880 --> 3:00:41.880]  I think their Skype just broke up, so they're gone.
[3:00:41.880 --> 3:00:45.880]  Gonna take your daughter out tonight.
[3:00:45.880 --> 3:00:48.880]  Gonna show her my world.
[3:00:48.880 --> 3:00:51.880]  Yeah! Father!
[3:00:51.880 --> 3:00:54.880]  Do you want a ram heads with me, baby?
[3:00:54.880 --> 3:00:57.880]  What about to see a light?
[3:00:57.880 --> 3:01:00.880]  We're getting into the Christian hymns here today. I apologize.
[3:01:00.880 --> 3:01:03.880]  infowars.com. I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[3:01:03.880 --> 3:01:07.880]  Rob Dew has come back in. His Skype has reoriented.
[3:01:07.880 --> 3:01:10.880]  He's here to give us a final transmission before David Knight,
[3:01:10.880 --> 3:01:13.880]  back from on the road on the east coast, covering the Trump events,
[3:01:13.880 --> 3:01:16.880]  is with us. Here's my deal. I don't completely trust Trump.
[3:01:16.880 --> 3:01:20.880]  He says stuff I disagree with, but the hysteria and misrepresentation
[3:01:20.880 --> 3:01:23.880]  over everything he says with the war crimes of Hillary
[3:01:23.880 --> 3:01:27.880]  and the evil of Obama and the neocon Republicans,
[3:01:27.880 --> 3:01:30.880]  the man has a saintly record compared to them,
[3:01:30.880 --> 3:01:33.880]  and he isn't a hypocrite about women or anything else like Cruz.
[3:01:33.880 --> 3:01:37.880]  I am down for Trump just to be anti-establishment and pro-populist.
[3:01:37.880 --> 3:01:42.880]  Rob Dew, what do you say from Jamesville, Wisconsin?
[3:01:42.880 --> 3:01:46.880]  All right, his mic is not in, his mic's internal, not external.
[3:01:46.880 --> 3:01:48.880]  Fuck your mic-ins.
[3:01:48.880 --> 3:01:51.880]  Doing such a great job, and hey, even mainstream media doesn't have,
[3:01:51.880 --> 3:01:54.880]  you know, tech that works this good. We're doing great with Skype.
[3:01:54.880 --> 3:01:56.880]  Yeah, I hear you, go ahead.
[3:01:56.880 --> 3:02:00.880]  All right, you know, people talk about Trump's past or where he did this or that.
[3:02:00.880 --> 3:02:04.880]  Bernie Sanders used to write Smut porn and talk about how women like to be raped.
[3:02:04.880 --> 3:02:07.880]  They like to fantasize about that. So what's up, man?
[3:02:07.880 --> 3:02:09.880]  Hey, talk to this guy. I want to talk to him.
[3:02:09.880 --> 3:02:11.880]  Ask him how he's doing. Go ahead.
[3:02:11.880 --> 3:02:13.880]  We have disagreements. We can all get along and be civil.
[3:02:13.880 --> 3:02:18.880]  So that's one thing that is going on here today. Alex is that it's been very civil.
[3:02:18.880 --> 3:02:23.880]  People are misguided and I feel bad for him, but that's about all you can do at this point.
[3:02:23.880 --> 3:02:25.880]  Well, Trump's coming up, what, in about two hours?
[3:02:25.880 --> 3:02:27.880]  Everything all lies matter, which is good.
[3:02:27.880 --> 3:02:28.880]  So something is working.
[3:02:28.880 --> 3:02:30.880]  Trump's coming up in two hours?
[3:02:30.880 --> 3:02:32.880]  Two hours. He'll be here at four o'clock.
[3:02:32.880 --> 3:02:36.880]  I don't even want you to get in there and cover him. I mean, he can't be one.
[3:02:36.880 --> 3:02:38.880]  I want you to cover these people.
[3:02:38.880 --> 3:02:41.880]  Yeah, I think it's going to get really heated about the time he gets here.
[3:02:41.880 --> 3:02:44.880]  So we'll be here covering that. I've been putting up reports all day.
[3:02:44.880 --> 3:02:47.880]  I've got a lot more stuff shot that I just haven't had time to upload,
[3:02:47.880 --> 3:02:49.880]  and that kid Daniels has been shooting.
[3:02:49.880 --> 3:02:53.880]  He's done a great job. The articles are up on infowords.com.
[3:02:53.880 --> 3:02:58.880]  What about asking him why they get hysterical about the word Trump written on chalk?
[3:02:58.880 --> 3:03:02.880]  Maybe you should get chalk and ride it in front of him and see if they have a heart attack.
[3:03:02.880 --> 3:03:06.880]  All right, I'll see if we can do that. That's a good idea.
[3:03:06.880 --> 3:03:10.880]  I did ask a couple people about that, and it's definitely getting louder.
[3:03:10.880 --> 3:03:14.880]  I'll say they had to change it. Somebody came up, this lady here,
[3:03:14.880 --> 3:03:16.880]  and told him to change it to Black Lives Matter.
[3:03:16.880 --> 3:03:19.880]  Let's go find that out. She told you what?
[3:03:19.880 --> 3:03:22.880]  She told him to change.
[3:03:22.880 --> 3:03:24.880]  Hey, can I talk to you real quick?
[3:03:24.880 --> 3:03:25.880]  Sure.
[3:03:25.880 --> 3:03:27.880]  So they were just saying All Lives Matter, and then it said,
[3:03:27.880 --> 3:03:29.880]  did you go up there and tell them to just say Black Lives Matter?
[3:03:29.880 --> 3:03:31.880]  Oh, no. No, I said we do each one.
[3:03:31.880 --> 3:03:32.880]  Oh, you do each one?
[3:03:32.880 --> 3:03:34.880]  Yeah, because All Lives Matter.
[3:03:34.880 --> 3:03:36.880]  I never know.
[3:03:36.880 --> 3:03:39.880]  Well, tell her, some of us say it's racist to say All Lives Matter.
[3:03:39.880 --> 3:03:41.880]  If you were not supposed to know,
[3:03:41.880 --> 3:03:44.880]  if you were not supposed to know that they were standing before, I went over there.
[3:03:44.880 --> 3:03:46.880]  I saw the All Lives Matter. I heard it, and that's when I thought they switched.
[3:03:46.880 --> 3:03:48.880]  I thought you went over there and took a look.
[3:03:48.880 --> 3:03:51.880]  Yeah, we all were, because All Lives do matter. All Lives do matter.
[3:03:51.880 --> 3:03:52.880]  Yeah.
[3:03:52.880 --> 3:03:54.880]  Ask her if they get scared if they see the name Donald Trump,
[3:03:54.880 --> 3:03:57.880]  because I get scared their signs say Trump. I need a psychologist.
[3:03:57.880 --> 3:04:00.880]  She's got a sign that says you're fired. That's kind of scares me.
[3:04:00.880 --> 3:04:03.880]  I don't ever want to be fired, but yeah.
[3:04:03.880 --> 3:04:08.880]  They definitely have learned how to shut down any type of discourse between people.
[3:04:08.880 --> 3:04:09.880]  And...
[3:04:09.880 --> 3:04:11.880]  Dude, you know you're not getting fired.
[3:04:11.880 --> 3:04:14.880]  No, I know. I'm not worried about that.
[3:04:14.880 --> 3:04:18.880]  We're going to have you set up on a big pink pillow in the control room.
[3:04:18.880 --> 3:04:20.880]  Like a royal creature.
[3:04:20.880 --> 3:04:24.880]  Yeah, this has been very interesting. It's definitely...
[3:04:24.880 --> 3:04:26.880]  I see you're not a golfer.
[3:04:26.880 --> 3:04:28.880]  Because there's three more events, Alex.
[3:04:28.880 --> 3:04:31.880]  There's two tomorrow and one Saturday, and there may be even more.
[3:04:31.880 --> 3:04:33.880]  He's talking about going to Madison, Wisconsin, which is a liberal hotbed.
[3:04:33.880 --> 3:04:35.880]  So that would be huge.
[3:04:35.880 --> 3:04:38.880]  All right, listen, we're out of time. David Knight's coming up.
[3:04:38.880 --> 3:04:41.880]  I want you to have him introduce, continue on, as long as your battery goes.
[3:04:41.880 --> 3:04:44.880]  Now, you've got to get recharge and other batteries and stuff.
[3:04:44.880 --> 3:04:47.880]  But Rob, do a great job. We'll follow your work and all the videos you're about to upload
[3:04:47.880 --> 3:04:49.880]  in HD, infowars.com.
[3:04:49.880 --> 3:04:51.880]  There's 55 minutes of transmission left.
[3:04:51.880 --> 3:05:17.880]  I'm Alex Jones. David Knight's coming out of the bullpen.
[3:05:17.880 --> 3:05:46.880]  I'm Alex Jones. David Knight's coming out of the bullpen.
[3:05:46.880 --> 3:05:49.880]  To attend President Barack Obama's Nuclear Security Summit,
[3:05:49.880 --> 3:05:53.880]  you can find more reports on infowars.com.
[3:05:53.880 --> 3:05:56.880]  Uh, yeah, first of all, I want to say,
[3:05:56.880 --> 3:06:00.880]  take the 12-act two, SuperMail, BrainForce, Prostigar, SilverBullet.
[3:06:00.880 --> 3:06:03.880]  I use them all. They're phenomenal. They work.
[3:06:03.880 --> 3:06:04.880]  Buy them, folks.
[3:06:04.880 --> 3:06:05.880]  Thank you, brother.
[3:06:05.880 --> 3:06:06.880]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[3:06:06.880 --> 3:06:09.880]  I am a relatively short-time listener
[3:06:09.880 --> 3:06:12.880]  and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[3:06:12.880 --> 3:06:14.880]  Welcome to the info war.
[3:06:14.880 --> 3:06:17.880]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals
[3:06:17.880 --> 3:06:20.880]  that support your health and the info war at the same time.
[3:06:20.880 --> 3:06:21.880]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[3:06:21.880 --> 3:06:22.880]  I buy all the nutraceuticals.
[3:06:22.880 --> 3:06:24.880]  Casio FX, uh, Mason.
[3:06:24.880 --> 3:06:26.880]  Right. God let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[3:06:26.880 --> 3:06:29.880]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[3:06:29.880 --> 3:06:31.880]  What products are you taking?
[3:06:31.880 --> 3:06:37.880]  Everything from, uh, SuperMail to, uh, BrainForce to WinterSun, uh, X2.
[3:06:37.880 --> 3:06:39.880]  Even got a little, uh, DNA force.
[3:06:39.880 --> 3:06:42.880]  So when I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autoville.
[3:06:42.880 --> 3:06:46.880]  Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research
[3:06:46.880 --> 3:06:47.880]  and to see the reviews for yourself.

[3:06:53.880 --> 3:06:56.880]  In the first decade of my battle against the globalist,
[3:06:56.880 --> 3:06:59.880]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[3:06:59.880 --> 3:07:03.880]  Now in the last four years, with help from the products at infowarslife.com,
[3:07:03.880 --> 3:07:06.880]  I have lost 80 plus pounds of that weight.
[3:07:06.880 --> 3:07:08.880]  And as many viewers have noted,
[3:07:08.880 --> 3:07:11.880]  the weight loss has accelerated in the last year.
[3:07:11.880 --> 3:07:15.880]  The big turning point was when I did my first liver cleanse.
[3:07:15.880 --> 3:07:17.880]  My friends, I have gotten a lot of dramatic results
[3:07:17.880 --> 3:07:19.880]  with the incredible products at infowarslife.com.
[3:07:19.880 --> 3:07:23.880]  But the most dramatic hands down and the reviewers agree with me,
[3:07:23.880 --> 3:07:26.880]  is the ultimate cleanse pack and the results you will see.
[3:07:26.880 --> 3:07:29.880]  We're giving you 20% off the ultimate cleanse pack

[3:07:35.880 --> 3:07:39.880]  A lot of my family and a lot of the office are now doing the cleanse with me
[3:07:39.880 --> 3:07:42.880]  and so I'm challenging you, the fellow infowars,
[3:07:42.880 --> 3:07:45.880]  to take action with me and do the cleanse as well.
[3:07:45.880 --> 3:07:47.880]  Just go to infowarslife.com for yourself,
[3:07:47.880 --> 3:07:51.880]  go to the liver cleanse, deep cleanse page and see the facts.
[3:07:51.880 --> 3:08:13.880]  He's the T-Rex of Political Talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:13.880 --> 3:08:17.880]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this Tuesday, March 29th, 2016.
[3:08:17.880 --> 3:08:19.880]  I'm your host, David Knight in the studio.
[3:08:19.880 --> 3:08:23.880]  I'm here today to talk about the story of a family at the hometown of Paul Ryan.
[3:08:23.880 --> 3:08:26.880]  Paul Ryan came out in opposition to him strongly in opposition to him
[3:08:26.880 --> 3:08:30.880]  and of course we're hearing all these GOP establishment figures
[3:08:30.880 --> 3:08:32.880]  like John Boehner, former Speaker of the House,
[3:08:32.880 --> 3:08:35.880]  saying I want to have Paul Ryan as President and Paul Ryan,
[3:08:35.880 --> 3:08:37.880]  no, no, no, not me, not me.
[3:08:37.880 --> 3:08:41.880]  Oh, no, no, I don't want the job and we heard that all before, haven't we?
[3:08:41.880 --> 3:08:44.880]  We heard all that when they were offering him as Speaker of the House
[3:08:44.880 --> 3:08:47.880]  and then they kept twisting his arm and then he became Speaker of the House
[3:08:47.880 --> 3:08:51.880]  reluctantly grasping the reins of power.
[3:08:51.880 --> 3:08:55.880]  You know, this is a guy who's now saying he doesn't want to be President,
[3:08:55.880 --> 3:08:57.880]  but it was just the last election.
[3:08:57.880 --> 3:09:00.880]  He was running for Vice President.
[3:09:00.880 --> 3:09:03.880]  Okay, so this is part of the Republican establishment.
[3:09:03.880 --> 3:09:09.880]  Donald Trump goes to his hometown to basically take it straight to him.
[3:09:09.880 --> 3:09:13.880]  There's a large contingent of people there that are pushing back
[3:09:13.880 --> 3:09:16.880]  and this is something that was inevitable from the very beginning.
[3:09:16.880 --> 3:09:19.880]  Donald Trump pushed back against political correctness
[3:09:19.880 --> 3:09:22.880]  and I think that's one of the things that those of us who like him
[3:09:22.880 --> 3:09:25.880]  and again, I don't believe that he's a perfect person.
[3:09:25.880 --> 3:09:28.880]  I don't agree with him on the civil liberties issues, but you know what?
[3:09:28.880 --> 3:09:32.880]  It's really slim pickings on civil liberties.
[3:09:32.880 --> 3:09:37.880]  I don't know anybody in either party that is currently running for President
[3:09:37.880 --> 3:09:39.880]  that is good on civil liberties.
[3:09:39.880 --> 3:09:42.880]  I liked a lot of the stuff that Rand Paul said he's not there anymore.
[3:09:42.880 --> 3:09:46.880]  I would have liked to seen him a lot stronger on civil liberties than he was
[3:09:46.880 --> 3:09:48.880]  and even the Libertarian Party.
[3:09:48.880 --> 3:09:52.880]  I thought they were extremely weak four years ago under Gary Johnson.
[3:09:52.880 --> 3:09:55.880]  He tended to focus on gay marriage and abortion
[3:09:55.880 --> 3:09:59.880]  and ignore the national security state, the police state.
[3:09:59.880 --> 3:10:02.880]  I couldn't believe what he chose to focus on.
[3:10:02.880 --> 3:10:08.880]  So yeah, there's not a lot of choices out there even running third party for civil liberties.
[3:10:08.880 --> 3:10:11.880]  We're going to have to do that in a different way, folks.
[3:10:11.880 --> 3:10:14.880]  We're going to find a person who loves to have power
[3:10:14.880 --> 3:10:17.880]  who is going to divest that from the center.
[3:10:17.880 --> 3:10:20.880]  But we can do some things to block the globalist.
[3:10:20.880 --> 3:10:23.880]  For whatever reason, Donald Trump for over 30 years
[3:10:23.880 --> 3:10:26.880]  has opposed the kind of globalist trade deals that we've seen.
[3:10:26.880 --> 3:10:30.880]  He's opposed the foreign policy that puts America's interest last.
[3:10:30.880 --> 3:10:33.880]  He is now proposing an America first foreign policy.
[3:10:33.880 --> 3:10:37.880]  He didn't coin that term, but he is using it repeatedly.
[3:10:37.880 --> 3:10:42.880]  Let's talk today about an in-depth interview that he had with the New York Times.
[3:10:42.880 --> 3:10:46.880]  It was a very good interview because it was about 40 pages if you print out the transcript.
[3:10:46.880 --> 3:10:50.880]  I don't want to talk about the back and forth because this is what
[3:10:50.880 --> 3:10:53.880]  the establishment of both parties wants to focus on.
[3:10:53.880 --> 3:10:57.880]  We have a very narrow range of issues that are always talked about
[3:10:57.880 --> 3:11:00.880]  and there's a slight distinction but not much of a difference
[3:11:00.880 --> 3:11:03.880]  between the two parties on those issues, as I've said before.
[3:11:03.880 --> 3:11:08.880]  And then on civil liberties, the only thing that's ever talked about is the Second Amendment.
[3:11:08.880 --> 3:11:11.880]  Everything else is pretty much ignored.
[3:11:11.880 --> 3:11:15.880]  This is the first time we've had a candidate who has directly
[3:11:15.880 --> 3:11:20.880]  attacked the establishment, the banks, the central banks,
[3:11:20.880 --> 3:11:24.880]  the globalists, the elitists who are writing these trade deals in secret.
[3:11:24.880 --> 3:11:27.880]  I think that is a big thing, but of course, going back to what I started to talk about,
[3:11:27.880 --> 3:11:31.880]  the political correctness and his attack on that,
[3:11:31.880 --> 3:11:36.880]  using that as the left has, as the right is now doing with Megan Kelly and Fox News,
[3:11:36.880 --> 3:11:41.880]  they use political correctness and the perpetually offended victim ideas
[3:11:41.880 --> 3:11:43.880]  to shut down any discussion of issues.
[3:11:43.880 --> 3:11:47.880]  Because if you start to get on to a real substantive issue,
[3:11:47.880 --> 3:11:53.880]  they shut you down and call you a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a xenophobe, whatever.
[3:11:53.880 --> 3:11:55.880]  Just to shut it down. They use these labels.
[3:11:55.880 --> 3:11:58.880]  And that's what you heard as Rob Dew was going down the crowd and talking to people,
[3:11:58.880 --> 3:12:01.880]  why don't you like Donald Trump? He's a racist. He's a racist.
[3:12:01.880 --> 3:12:03.880]  That's all they talk about.
[3:12:03.880 --> 3:12:07.880]  So it was inevitable when he started pushing back on political correctness
[3:12:07.880 --> 3:12:10.880]  that it was going to be a head-to-head collision with these people,
[3:12:10.880 --> 3:12:16.880]  that they were going to be absolutely furious and call him racist repeatedly
[3:12:16.880 --> 3:12:18.880]  because it wasn't having any effect.
[3:12:18.880 --> 3:12:24.880]  He went directly to their primary method of controlling the discussion
[3:12:24.880 --> 3:12:29.880]  by dumbing it down, by shaming you into silence, by calling you a racist
[3:12:29.880 --> 3:12:31.880]  whenever you disagree with them on a policy issue.
[3:12:31.880 --> 3:12:33.880]  Rob Dew's ready. Let's go back to that crowd.
[3:12:33.880 --> 3:12:36.880]  I want to see what's happening there and ask Rob a couple of questions.
[3:12:36.880 --> 3:12:41.880]  Rob, are there any people there lining up for the event tonight?
[3:12:41.880 --> 3:12:43.880]  It's quite a few hours away, isn't it?
[3:12:43.880 --> 3:12:46.880]  There's no Trump supporters here at all. It's totally devoid.
[3:12:46.880 --> 3:12:48.880]  These are all anti-Trump. Oh, no, I'm kidding.
[3:12:48.880 --> 3:12:50.880]  These are all the Trump supporters right here.
[3:12:50.880 --> 3:12:56.880]  So the line starts over here, comes this way, and then snakes back beyond these people,
[3:12:56.880 --> 3:12:58.880]  way over that way. It's a huge crowd. We're going to come around.
[3:12:58.880 --> 3:13:01.880]  I'll show you the full crowd. It's huge.
[3:13:01.880 --> 3:13:04.880]  And I asked you that question, Rob, because I asked you that question
[3:13:04.880 --> 3:13:07.880]  because when we were in New York, everybody was focusing.
[3:13:07.880 --> 3:13:09.880]  There was the event there, APAC.
[3:13:09.880 --> 3:13:13.880]  They had about 15,000 people going into this massive Verizon stadium there
[3:13:13.880 --> 3:13:17.880]  to listen to the speakers, and they had a small group of protesters
[3:13:17.880 --> 3:13:21.880]  that were surrounded by police to protect them from the crowd,
[3:13:21.880 --> 3:13:23.880]  to protect the crowd from them.
[3:13:23.880 --> 3:13:27.880]  And that crowd stayed there. You could see that crowd after everybody had filed in.
[3:13:27.880 --> 3:13:30.880]  But the media comes by. The drive-by media takes a picture of it.
[3:13:30.880 --> 3:13:34.880]  Here's the rest of them, David. Sorry to interrupt you, but here's the rest of the crowd.
[3:13:34.880 --> 3:13:38.880]  It snakes along back this way, back way over there.
[3:13:38.880 --> 3:13:41.880]  I think they should have got a bigger boat to quote Jaws.
[3:13:41.880 --> 3:13:47.880]  And see, that's the thing. You can see that there in Washington, they were all compacted
[3:13:47.880 --> 3:13:52.880]  and flowing back and forth into it, and it was a line, but it looked like a massive mob.
[3:13:52.880 --> 3:13:54.880]  Stay right here. I'll intervene in a second.
[3:13:54.880 --> 3:13:57.880]  Yeah, it's amazing. It's a lot of people here.
[3:13:57.880 --> 3:14:01.880]  The protesters, I would say it's 21 Trump supporters to protesters.
[3:14:01.880 --> 3:14:04.880]  I got one right here. It just came over to me. He said he wanted to say hi to Alex Jones.
[3:14:04.880 --> 3:14:06.880]  David Knight is actually on the air right now.
[3:14:06.880 --> 3:14:10.880]  Why are you here? What makes you, what makes Trump like your candidate?
[3:14:10.880 --> 3:14:13.880]  Because he says what's on his mind, and he's not afraid to say it.
[3:14:13.880 --> 3:14:17.880]  And so I like that. I like where he stands on different issues, protecting America,
[3:14:17.880 --> 3:14:23.880]  making America great, bringing jobs back, taxing China, you know, making things, squaring things up.
[3:14:23.880 --> 3:14:30.880]  Squaring things up. When you talk to these people over here, they say talk like that is scary and racist and xenophobic and sexist.
[3:14:30.880 --> 3:14:32.880]  They just want to put a label on it, I guess.
[3:14:32.880 --> 3:14:34.880]  Well, what's wrong with taking care of America?
[3:14:34.880 --> 3:14:40.880]  Every other country takes care of themselves. Why can't we be proud Americans and do what's best for this country?
[3:14:40.880 --> 3:14:42.880]  I hope you're like a true racist.
[3:14:42.880 --> 3:14:50.880]  They call me what they want to, but, you know, I don't wear the label Black, African American. I'm an American.
[3:14:50.880 --> 3:14:53.880]  And I, you know, I've learned a lot over the years and it's about America.
[3:14:53.880 --> 3:14:56.880]  It's about this country and doing what's right for this country.
[3:14:56.880 --> 3:14:59.880]  And so that's where Trump is leaning. And so that's where I'm at.
[3:14:59.880 --> 3:15:01.880]  I hope you make it in. I think you're gonna make it in.
[3:15:01.880 --> 3:15:05.880]  Well, I hope so. I've been here for over three hours. So I hope I will.
[3:15:05.880 --> 3:15:09.880]  David, I was out here at 9 a.m. and there was already a line forming.
[3:15:09.880 --> 3:15:15.880]  And that was with no protesters at that time. So it was definitely far out.
[3:15:15.880 --> 3:15:17.880]  Do you have any questions for this panel? What's your name?
[3:15:17.880 --> 3:15:18.880]  Ken Hurford.
[3:15:18.880 --> 3:15:20.880]  This is Ken. Do you have any questions for Mr. Ken?
[3:15:20.880 --> 3:15:24.880]  Yeah, I was gonna tell him that I was gonna cover a story from National Review.
[3:15:24.880 --> 3:15:31.880]  We're basically, they're attacking the white middle class now, saying that white middle class sees themselves as victims.
[3:15:31.880 --> 3:15:37.880]  They're just not doing anything. They're using drugs and it's all their fault.
[3:15:37.880 --> 3:15:39.880]  And we've heard this for many years about the Black community.
[3:15:39.880 --> 3:15:41.880]  That's the way they've attacked the Black community as well.
[3:15:41.880 --> 3:15:47.880]  And when I see him there, I understand that, you know, I think now when we look at this story,
[3:15:47.880 --> 3:15:53.880]  we understand this has been a technique to essentially shut down white people's sympathy for what's going on in the Black community.
[3:15:53.880 --> 3:15:57.880]  But now we need to understand that the real divide isn't between Black and white,
[3:15:57.880 --> 3:16:00.880]  but it's between the elitists and the middle and lower class.
[3:16:00.880 --> 3:16:01.880]  Yeah, go ahead.
[3:16:01.880 --> 3:16:02.880]  The long question.
[3:16:02.880 --> 3:16:04.880]  Yeah, I know. Just kind of give them that feel for it, yeah.
[3:16:04.880 --> 3:16:07.880]  Yeah, sure, sure. So this is a national review article you're talking about?
[3:16:07.880 --> 3:16:08.880]  Yeah, yeah.
[3:16:08.880 --> 3:16:14.880]  Okay, so David's talking about there's a national review article that came out and basically saying that it's the white middle class has screwed up America.
[3:16:14.880 --> 3:16:20.880]  The kids are spoiled. They're using drugs and, you know, just not being good citizens.
[3:16:20.880 --> 3:16:27.880]  And so David's saying that was the arguments they were also using in the 50s and 60s against Blacks to try to separate people.
[3:16:27.880 --> 3:16:30.880]  Trying to say, so now the middle class is bad for America.
[3:16:30.880 --> 3:16:33.880]  And so I guess we need elites and then like low worker serfs.
[3:16:33.880 --> 3:16:37.880]  I guess that's the only way we can have happiness, true happiness in America.
[3:16:37.880 --> 3:16:39.880]  But anyway, what do you think about that?
[3:16:39.880 --> 3:16:41.880]  Have you seen that in your living in your life?
[3:16:41.880 --> 3:16:45.880]  No, as a matter of fact, that kind of takes opposite opinion on that.
[3:16:45.880 --> 3:16:49.880]  I believe one of the reasons that America has fallen, yeah, we got to deal with some issues.
[3:16:49.880 --> 3:16:52.880]  America is not perfect. There's racism. There's all kind of stuff.
[3:16:52.880 --> 3:16:58.880]  But at the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of Americans are American.
[3:16:58.880 --> 3:17:01.880]  And it's about America. And so I don't buy into that.
[3:17:01.880 --> 3:17:05.880]  I just think one of the problems I think with the white America is this.
[3:17:05.880 --> 3:17:10.880]  They don't they're too intimidated to speak up for what's right because they're afraid of being labeled for stuff.
[3:17:10.880 --> 3:17:13.880]  Speak up for what's right. You don't have to stand up for what's wrong.
[3:17:13.880 --> 3:17:20.880]  But speak up for what's right. Stop being intimidated because, you know, it's hurting the entire country because you won't stand up for what's right.
[3:17:20.880 --> 3:17:24.880]  I don't care if it's a black person or Latino or white person could be crying.
[3:17:24.880 --> 3:17:28.880]  He needs to go to jail. If he if he's doing things wrong, they need to be dealt with.
[3:17:28.880 --> 3:17:33.880]  You know, and for the people who was working hard doing right, we need opportunity to fail or succeed.
[3:17:33.880 --> 3:17:35.880]  We don't need big government telling us what to do.
[3:17:35.880 --> 3:17:41.880]  I don't need them watching over me telling me what I can and can't have if I need them shipping in their drugs either.
[3:17:41.880 --> 3:17:45.880]  Right. Exactly. So if I if I succeed, I succeed.
[3:17:45.880 --> 3:17:48.880]  If I fail, I fail, but allow me to freedom to do that.
[3:17:48.880 --> 3:17:51.880]  And I believe in liberty. That's why I love the station because I believe in liberty.
[3:17:51.880 --> 3:17:53.880]  Right on. Do you live here in Wisconsin?
[3:17:53.880 --> 3:17:54.880]  Yeah, I live in Beloit, Wisconsin.
[3:17:54.880 --> 3:17:56.880]  All right. What do you do for a living?
[3:17:56.880 --> 3:17:57.880]  I'm a substitute teacher.
[3:17:57.880 --> 3:17:59.880]  Oh, right. I used to do that. Middle school is the worst.
[3:17:59.880 --> 3:18:04.880]  Absolutely. Hey, I think that's what you're there in this with all teachers, man.
[3:18:04.880 --> 3:18:09.880]  You try your hardest to stay away from the middle schools, but sometimes you got to go bite the bullet.
[3:18:09.880 --> 3:18:12.880]  And those kids need help too, though. Hey, good luck to you. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot for talking.
[3:18:12.880 --> 3:18:15.880]  All right. Yeah. Hi.
[3:18:15.880 --> 3:18:18.880]  So, yeah, Richard said you're from the Ukraine.
[3:18:18.880 --> 3:18:22.880]  I'm actually not from Ukraine, but all four of my grandparents came over legally.
[3:18:22.880 --> 3:18:25.880]  They had to wait the lottery. They were refugees.
[3:18:25.880 --> 3:18:32.880]  My grandfather, one of my grandfathers married my grandmother and he came over to America and had to wait.
[3:18:32.880 --> 3:18:34.880]  She had to wait to come over as well.
[3:18:34.880 --> 3:18:37.880]  But in regards to that, I know I can just talk about anything forever,
[3:18:37.880 --> 3:18:40.880]  but I'm Ukrainian 100%.
[3:18:40.880 --> 3:18:44.880]  And what's going on in Ukraine right now needs to be addressed.
[3:18:44.880 --> 3:18:46.880]  And I know that Kasek addressed it.
[3:18:46.880 --> 3:18:50.880]  And I want to find out what Trump has to say as well because to be honest with you,
[3:18:50.880 --> 3:18:56.880]  I voted Kasek in the Illinois primary because I was at the UIC convention center
[3:18:56.880 --> 3:18:59.880]  and he canceled it because of the protests.
[3:18:59.880 --> 3:19:02.880]  And I didn't get to hear what he had to say unfiltered by the media.
[3:19:02.880 --> 3:19:06.880]  That's why I'm here today because even though I'm not a voter in Wisconsin,
[3:19:06.880 --> 3:19:09.880]  he might be the president one day.
[3:19:09.880 --> 3:19:10.880]  He might get the nomination.
[3:19:10.880 --> 3:19:15.880]  And oh, if he gets the nomination for sure, like seriously, I will vote for him for reels.
[3:19:15.880 --> 3:19:18.880]  Like for serious, I'll vote for him.
[3:19:18.880 --> 3:19:22.880]  Sorry, I'm trying to be hip with the culture and everything like that and be on fleek, but you know.
[3:19:22.880 --> 3:19:24.880]  We're not super hip at Info Wars.
[3:19:24.880 --> 3:19:31.880]  David, do you know what's going on with Soros' or I guess Trump's view of what's going on in the Ukraine?
[3:19:31.880 --> 3:19:33.880]  Has he come out and said anything about it?
[3:19:33.880 --> 3:19:35.880]  I'm going to talk about his foreign policy approach to it.
[3:19:35.880 --> 3:19:42.880]  What he said about the Ukraine, Rob, was that he was surprised that the countries that were close to Ukraine
[3:19:42.880 --> 3:19:47.880]  weren't taking a more active role in it if they thought that it was a danger from Russia.
[3:19:47.880 --> 3:19:50.880]  And that, of course, plays into what he was talking about with America first.
[3:19:50.880 --> 3:19:53.880]  Stay with us. We're going to go right back to Rob Dew.
[3:19:53.880 --> 3:19:56.880]  He's in Wisconsin and the Trump rally. We'll be right back.
[3:19:56.880 --> 3:20:00.880]  If you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years
[3:20:00.880 --> 3:20:05.880]  and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall,
[3:20:05.880 --> 3:20:09.880]  there's something that is changing thousands of people's lives and you could be one of them.
[3:20:09.880 --> 3:20:11.880]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[3:20:11.880 --> 3:20:17.880]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[3:20:17.880 --> 3:20:23.880]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals,
[3:20:23.880 --> 3:20:27.880]  amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[3:20:27.880 --> 3:20:33.880]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[3:20:33.880 --> 3:20:37.880]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetic cells.
[3:20:37.880 --> 3:20:42.880]  The body is an amazing thing. It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[3:20:42.880 --> 3:20:47.880]  Heart and Body Extract gets results. To order your two-month supply, call now.

[3:20:53.880 --> 3:20:57.880]  Hey everyone, with 20-plus years as a radio host, I've seen about everything.
[3:20:57.880 --> 3:21:02.880]  One thing that keeps recurring though are these Time Share charlatans.
[3:21:02.880 --> 3:21:08.880]  These high-pressure sales people who get folks to come out to some resort for a special weekend offer,
[3:21:08.880 --> 3:21:12.880]  then they get them in a corner and browbeat them and coerce them into buying a Time Share.
[3:21:12.880 --> 3:21:14.880]  They don't need, they don't want and they can't afford.
[3:21:14.880 --> 3:21:20.880]  And then they're stuck with that thing forever. Monthly payments, mortgage payments, annual fees that keep going up and up.
[3:21:20.880 --> 3:21:23.880]  Well, up until recently, people thought they couldn't get rid of these things.
[3:21:23.880 --> 3:21:27.880]  You know, you can't get out of the contract, you can't get out of the deed or the membership. Well, that's not true.
[3:21:27.880 --> 3:21:33.880]  My friends at American Consumer Credit, a Time Share release company, can get you free.
[3:21:33.880 --> 3:21:35.880]  That's their personal guarantee.
[3:21:35.880 --> 3:21:40.880]  12 years in business, free consultation, A-plus rating with the BBB, they're the real deal.
[3:21:40.880 --> 3:21:43.880]  You want to get out of your Time Share contract, call them now.

[3:21:50.880 --> 3:21:53.880]  Call now, 800-587-3948.
[3:21:54.880 --> 3:21:57.880]  There's no easy way to tell you this, but you're being overcharged for your razors.
[3:21:57.880 --> 3:22:00.880]  Should an 8-pack of blades really cost $32?
[3:22:00.880 --> 3:22:02.880]  And Harry's? Our answer is no.
[3:22:02.880 --> 3:22:08.880]  Harry's gives you a smooth, comfortable shave with the highest quality razors and only charges about half of what our competitors do.

[3:22:11.880 --> 3:22:14.880]  You can just choose to charge less for something really well made?
[3:22:14.880 --> 3:22:15.880]  Well, yeah.
[3:22:15.880 --> 3:22:20.880]  We really do believe in providing our customers with the highest quality products at the best value possible.
[3:22:20.880 --> 3:22:27.880]  We're able to do this because we own our factory, ship directly to you, and because, well, we don't think it's fair to overcharge.
[3:22:27.880 --> 3:22:29.880]  Thankfully, our customers agree.
[3:22:29.880 --> 3:22:35.880]  Since launching Harry's, over a million guys just like you have made the switch and have been telling us how much better their shaving experience is.

[3:24:00.880 --> 3:24:04.880]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host on this Tuesday.
[3:24:04.880 --> 3:24:14.880]  March 29, 2016, of course, we have Rob Dew and the Infowars crew at the Wisconsin rally that set the hometown of Paul Ryan.
[3:24:14.880 --> 3:24:22.880]  And when we come back and we have Rob Dew, ask some of the people online how they feel about this effort to take the delegates after the election.
[3:24:22.880 --> 3:24:28.880]  This is what the GOP establishment is doing. It's what Ted Cruz is doing with their encouragement, with their support.
[3:24:28.880 --> 3:24:36.880]  And of course, Paul Ryan from the town where this rally is being held is one of the names that they're holding up as someone they might coronate.
[3:24:36.880 --> 3:24:39.880]  Because, you know, the voters just can't get it right.
[3:24:39.880 --> 3:24:46.880]  Yeah, I think we need to stop talking about how they're trying to stop Trump, how they're trying to steal the votes from Trump.
[3:24:46.880 --> 3:24:49.880]  No, they're stealing the votes from the voters.
[3:24:49.880 --> 3:24:56.880]  Remember, we had that political consultant on Showtime's The Circus that, you know what, all Donald Trump's got is a lot of voters.
[3:24:56.880 --> 3:24:59.880]  Let's just take the voters. Now, he didn't say, so let's just take the voters.
[3:24:59.880 --> 3:25:02.880]  He did say, all he's got is a bunch of voters.
[3:25:02.880 --> 3:25:11.880]  Well, that's our voice. That's our input into the government as small as it is, as corrupt as the whole system is.
[3:25:11.880 --> 3:25:15.880]  That's our only little voice. And now they want to take even that away.
[3:25:15.880 --> 3:25:19.880]  And that ought to make us incredibly angry.
[3:25:19.880 --> 3:25:28.880]  Just as angry as if we saw them coming in with guns and carting out boxes full of ballots and burning them after we had voted.
[3:25:28.880 --> 3:25:31.880]  Because that's what Ted Cruz and the GOP is doing.
[3:25:31.880 --> 3:25:35.880]  They're using every tactic they can to get rid of the voters' preferences.
[3:25:35.880 --> 3:25:42.880]  And we get a situation where you've got a massive plurality for one candidate and they throw this to the wind because they say,
[3:25:42.880 --> 3:25:50.880]  no, no, no, our magic rule is 50% plus one. And it doesn't matter if we've got hundreds more delegates for this one candidate.
[3:25:50.880 --> 3:25:52.880]  We've got a massive plurality for this candidate.
[3:25:52.880 --> 3:25:57.880]  It doesn't matter if he won every single district in South Carolina, every single delegate.
[3:25:57.880 --> 3:26:01.880]  No, no, no, we're going to give those delegates to Ted Cruz. They do that.
[3:26:01.880 --> 3:26:05.880]  There ought to be a revolution. And if there isn't, this country is over.
[3:26:05.880 --> 3:26:11.880]  Now, before we go back to Rob Do, I just want to let you know about a couple of specials that are going to be ending tomorrow at infowarslife.com.
[3:26:11.880 --> 3:26:16.880]  We have a special on Deep Cleanse, 10% off at ends tomorrow at infowarslife.com.
[3:26:16.880 --> 3:26:20.880]  And of course, Deep Cleanse is our fastest-selling infowarslife formula yet.
[3:26:20.880 --> 3:26:23.880]  We keep selling out for weeks, for months at a time.
[3:26:23.880 --> 3:26:27.880]  And of course, you can always make sure you get any of these products that are constantly selling out like Deep Cleanse.

[3:26:53.880 --> 3:26:58.880]  You can get that, or we also have a special 20% off, the ultimate cleanse pack.
[3:26:58.880 --> 3:27:02.880]  Now, that includes Deep Cleanse, but it also includes Lover Shield oxypowder.

[3:27:16.880 --> 3:27:21.880]  and take advantage of that. And also, make sure that you sign up for auto-ship if you try these products and like them.
[3:27:21.880 --> 3:27:24.880]  That way, they will never go out of stock for you.
[3:27:24.880 --> 3:27:27.880]  Do we have Rob back? Let's go back to Rob.
[3:27:27.880 --> 3:27:34.880]  I want to see if Rob can ask some people there how they feel about this Stop Trump movement, which is really Stop the Vote.
[3:27:34.880 --> 3:27:37.880]  That's why we ought to start calling it Stop the Vote.
[3:27:37.880 --> 3:27:40.880]  We've had the GOP delegates say, hey, why do we have primaries and caucuses?
[3:27:40.880 --> 3:27:45.880]  He said, oh, that's a good question. I don't even know why we need those, because we delegates are going to be the ones who decide.
[3:27:45.880 --> 3:27:52.880]  Right. Well, hey, David, as I was over here in the Trump line, the people going in to see Trump, I saw this lady, her name's Ariella,
[3:27:52.880 --> 3:27:57.880]  and she has a love Trump's hate. And so I haven't even asked her this yet. I just told her to stand by.
[3:27:57.880 --> 3:28:00.880]  So are you a Trump supporter or are you a protester?
[3:28:00.880 --> 3:28:01.880]  I'm a protester.
[3:28:01.880 --> 3:28:03.880]  And so why are you in line to go see Trump?
[3:28:03.880 --> 3:28:06.880]  Because as a citizen of this country, I have a right to hear what a presidential candidate has to say.
[3:28:06.880 --> 3:28:08.880]  And you're going to bring that sign in?
[3:28:08.880 --> 3:28:09.880]  I'm going to try.
[3:28:09.880 --> 3:28:14.880]  And are you going to try to disrupt the rally in any way?
[3:28:14.880 --> 3:28:17.880]  No. My intention is to go in peace, for sure.
[3:28:17.880 --> 3:28:24.880]  I just want to make my voice heard, regardless. I do feel like I have a right to make a voice heard, though.
[3:28:24.880 --> 3:28:30.880]  What do you think about the Republican establishment coming out and saying, and this is one of the heads, I think he was in Nebraska, said,
[3:28:30.880 --> 3:28:36.880]  these elections don't even matter because the party picks who they're going to run for president. What kind of country is that?
[3:28:36.880 --> 3:28:39.880]  One that's not controlled by the people.
[3:28:39.880 --> 3:28:40.880]  Exactly.
[3:28:40.880 --> 3:28:44.880]  How does she feel about the Democrat super delegate? Does she like that situation?
[3:28:44.880 --> 3:28:51.880]  What do you feel about, so Louisiana primary, before it started, 0% votes coming in, Hillary already had six delegates.
[3:28:51.880 --> 3:28:54.880]  How do you feel about that? Like, they're literally stealing it from Bernie Sanders?
[3:28:54.880 --> 3:29:00.880]  I'm completely convinced that these elections are rigged. I've seen evidence in prior elections that I've worked where the numbers didn't line up,
[3:29:00.880 --> 3:29:06.880]  and I just didn't have enough evidence because, you know, I was only one person, but the citizens always know, I think, in the end.
[3:29:06.880 --> 3:29:09.880]  I agree. Yeah, there definitely is something going on.
[3:29:09.880 --> 3:29:11.880]  So are you going with friends or your friends, Trump supporters?
[3:29:11.880 --> 3:29:15.880]  You know, all my friends are over with other protesters. Nobody wanted to join me in the line.
[3:29:15.880 --> 3:29:18.880]  So, presently, I'm going in alone.
[3:29:18.880 --> 3:29:23.880]  So you're not afraid that you're going to get attacked, or you're not afraid of any threats of violence against yourself?
[3:29:23.880 --> 3:29:31.880]  It could happen to me, but Martin Luther King was willing to put up with a lot, and he died for his cause, so I kind of used him as my little inner hero.
[3:29:31.880 --> 3:29:33.880]  He inspires me to stay strong.
[3:29:33.880 --> 3:29:35.880]  That's good. I agree with that. We got to go to break, Rob.
[3:29:35.880 --> 3:29:43.880]  I absolutely agree with going to a protest, holding up your sign, soundly, as long as you don't disrupt and shut down other people's speech.
[3:29:43.880 --> 3:29:45.880]  Stay with us and be right back with Rob Do.
[3:29:45.880 --> 3:29:47.880]  The Empires on the Run.
[3:29:47.880 --> 3:30:16.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:20.880 --> 3:30:25.880]  Investigated how following a certain food guide affected the country's mortality rate.
[3:30:25.880 --> 3:30:38.880]  The team analyzed food and lifestyle questionnaires completed by 36,000 men and 42,000 women aged between 45 and 75 who had no history of cancer, stroke, heart or chronic liver disease.
[3:30:38.880 --> 3:30:41.880]  Participants were tracked for 15 years.
[3:30:41.880 --> 3:30:48.880]  Researchers found that participants who closely followed the food guide had a 15% lower mortality rate.
[3:30:48.880 --> 3:30:55.880]  You can find more reports on infowars.com.
[3:30:55.880 --> 3:30:59.880]  Thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry.
[3:30:59.880 --> 3:31:07.880]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[3:31:07.880 --> 3:31:16.880]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[3:31:16.880 --> 3:31:20.880]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[3:31:20.880 --> 3:31:30.880]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[3:31:30.880 --> 3:31:44.880]  To personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex, Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[3:31:44.880 --> 3:31:47.880]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.

[3:31:53.880 --> 3:31:57.880]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[3:31:57.880 --> 3:32:05.880]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[3:33:01.880 --> 3:33:07.880]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[3:33:07.880 --> 3:33:11.880]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight.
[3:33:11.880 --> 3:33:17.880]  We're going to be going back to Rob Dew who is in Wisconsin where the Donald Trump rally is going to be held in about an hour and a half.
[3:33:17.880 --> 3:33:21.880]  There's a massive crowd of people who are lined up to get into that rally.
[3:33:21.880 --> 3:33:29.880]  And there's some protesters out there, of course, as it's going to be a common feature of all the Donald Trump rallies that we see coming up.
[3:33:29.880 --> 3:33:36.880]  We were just asking some of the people online about what they feel about the effort to steal the vote, because that's really what it is.
[3:33:36.880 --> 3:33:42.880]  Let's understand that stop Trump is really steal the vote.
[3:33:42.880 --> 3:33:48.880]  It's not about taking delegates from Donald Trump, it's about taking delegates from the voters who have selected them.
[3:33:48.880 --> 3:33:52.880]  I want to go back to Rob and see if he's got anybody there who wants to weigh in on that. Go ahead, Rob.
[3:33:52.880 --> 3:33:54.880]  Yeah, so what's your name, sir?
[3:33:54.880 --> 3:33:55.880]  Kirk Kafer.
[3:33:55.880 --> 3:34:02.880]  All right, Kirk. What do you think about what's going on with the Republican establishment coming out and saying, essentially, we can steal this from Trump,
[3:34:02.880 --> 3:34:08.880]  even if he has the delegates, we could just go either make a broker convention happen, we're going to keep these guys in who aren't going to win.
[3:34:08.880 --> 3:34:12.880]  And they literally said the party chooses not the people.
[3:34:12.880 --> 3:34:17.880]  Well, I think it's good. It's an outrage. And if they go and do that, I think it'll destroy the Republican party.
[3:34:17.880 --> 3:34:19.880]  And I got to the bed. I hope there's no violence.
[3:34:19.880 --> 3:34:22.880]  Trump said there'd be a riot. I don't know what he's talking about.
[3:34:22.880 --> 3:34:28.880]  Can a riot probably an uproar and an outspoken public who would be totally outraged if that were to happen?
[3:34:28.880 --> 3:34:34.880]  The Republican party always wanted to be the inclusive party and bring in independents and Democrats and ethnic minorities.
[3:34:34.880 --> 3:34:39.880]  And Trump is doing that and they're trying to, you know, affect his outcome of the election.
[3:34:39.880 --> 3:34:42.880]  I think it's totally outrageous, but hopefully he wins it outright.
[3:34:42.880 --> 3:34:44.880]  And we'll see here.
[3:34:44.880 --> 3:34:49.880]  Yeah. What do you think about what recently came out with Ted Cruz and the sex scandal?
[3:34:49.880 --> 3:34:54.880]  I mean, we don't cover that that much, but do you think it might sink or hurt his chances here in Wisconsin?
[3:34:54.880 --> 3:34:59.880]  Not sure. I don't know the accuracy of that. I know I heard.
[3:34:59.880 --> 3:35:04.880]  I don't know the truth that the CEO of National Choir is a friend, a good friend of Donald Trump,
[3:35:04.880 --> 3:35:08.880]  and he vehemently denies that he had anything to do with that,
[3:35:08.880 --> 3:35:16.880]  just like he had nothing to do with the picture that supposedly Ted Cruz put out about his wife when she did a naked pose for,
[3:35:16.880 --> 3:35:20.880]  I don't know what magazine that was, but yeah, I don't know if I believe it or not.
[3:35:20.880 --> 3:35:25.880]  I mean, the truth to that. But yeah, that's all I got to say to that.
[3:35:25.880 --> 3:35:30.880]  You know, Rob, I want to chime in on that. I think that whole thing was a setup by the Cruz organization.
[3:35:30.880 --> 3:35:38.880]  You know, Rubio had been shopping the thing, as they called it, to all these different media outlets before he dropped out quite some time about a month earlier.
[3:35:38.880 --> 3:35:47.880]  Anonymous had been all over social media saying that they were going to leak details about Ted Cruz's affairs, about his liaisons with prostitutes.
[3:35:47.880 --> 3:35:51.880]  And that happened just a couple of days before the National Enquirer came out.
[3:35:51.880 --> 3:35:56.880]  And I'm sure that the Cruz campaign knew that this National Enquirer story was about to break.
[3:35:56.880 --> 3:36:02.880]  I'm not sure that the Donald Trump campaign knew, but I can guarantee you the Ted Cruz campaign knew.
[3:36:02.880 --> 3:36:10.880]  So what did they do, Rob? They came out with an attack designed to provoke Trump, to get him to push back,
[3:36:10.880 --> 3:36:15.880]  so that it could look like the National Enquirer story was something that Donald Trump had put out there.
[3:36:15.880 --> 3:36:19.880]  This was something that Anonymous was going to put out. It was something other media organizations were going to put out.
[3:36:19.880 --> 3:36:27.880]  And I think that whether or not he had responded to that, I think they still would have blamed him for the National Enquirer.
[3:36:27.880 --> 3:36:33.880]  So if Donald Trump had been completely silent about what that Cruz Super PAC had done with the tweet about his wife,
[3:36:33.880 --> 3:36:39.880]  I think they still would have said, oh, we put this tweet out about your wife, and now you responded with this National Enquirer.
[3:36:39.880 --> 3:36:47.880]  It was, I think, a masterful play by Ted Cruz shows us what a devious Machiavellian character he is, in my opinion.
[3:36:47.880 --> 3:36:55.880]  Newt Gingrich says, hey, it was utterly stupid for Donald Trump to get sucked into this fight with Donald Cruz's wife.
[3:36:55.880 --> 3:37:01.880]  I don't think that's what happened. I think this was a setup by Ted Cruz, and I'll tell you something else, Rob.
[3:37:01.880 --> 3:37:07.880]  I think that when you look at the way he dodged this question from the Daily Mail reporter,
[3:37:07.880 --> 3:37:12.880]  they asked him, they said, why don't you say that you've been faithful?
[3:37:12.880 --> 3:37:17.880]  They said, instead of making a blanket declaration that he's been faithful during the entirety of his 14-year marriage,
[3:37:17.880 --> 3:37:23.880]  a move that would effectively end the vicious news cycle, Cruz stood silently as a campaign surrogate.
[3:37:23.880 --> 3:37:27.880]  Carly Fiorina leapt in to intercept the question and change the subject.
[3:37:27.880 --> 3:37:37.880]  And this is Carly Fiorina, who, if you remember, back in July, was given $500 million by another super PAC.
[3:37:37.880 --> 3:37:50.880]  They spent $500,000, they spent $536,000 that super PAC did, and $500,000 of that was given to Carly Fiorina.
[3:37:50.880 --> 3:37:58.880]  And at the end of the quarter, the FEC said, what's going on? You're a Cruz super PAC. Why are you giving virtually all of your money to Carly Fiorina?
[3:37:58.880 --> 3:38:05.880]  Well, now we see Carly Fiorina stepping in as Cruz comes back and says, no, no, no, I'm not going to say that I was faithful to my wife.
[3:38:05.880 --> 3:38:11.880]  This is a guy whose wife says, our campaign is the face of God to America.
[3:38:11.880 --> 3:38:16.880]  And I want to say, if Ted Cruz has been faithful to his wife, why is he afraid to say it?
[3:38:16.880 --> 3:38:24.880]  Why, if he's the face of God to America and he wants to parade his public piety around in his good works, why don't you talk about your faithfulness to your wife?
[3:38:24.880 --> 3:38:29.880]  Maybe you're about as faithful to your wife, Ted, as you are with your tithing.
[3:38:29.880 --> 3:38:35.880]  You know, evangelicals have said, hey, we think you ought to give 10%. He doesn't give 1-tenth of 1% to any charity.
[3:38:35.880 --> 3:38:38.880]  All charities combine. It's less than 1%. So they pressed him on this.
[3:38:38.880 --> 3:38:42.880]  They asked him a second time after Carly Fiorina had run interference for him.
[3:38:42.880 --> 3:38:47.880]  That's why she was standing there for him. They said, Senator, I'm sorry, this is a very serious question about your character.
[3:38:47.880 --> 3:38:57.880]  See, he's made it about him being the fulfillment of some kind of Mormon messianic prophecy, okay?
[3:38:57.880 --> 3:39:02.880]  He says he's the face of God to America. You got Glenn Beck leading prayer rallies for him everywhere.
[3:39:02.880 --> 3:39:08.880]  So if you're going to put yourself out there as that kind of a person, you shouldn't have a problem saying that you've been faithful to his wife.
[3:39:08.880 --> 3:39:13.880]  And so they said, well, you just, if the answer is yes, just say, yes, I've been faithful to my wife.
[3:39:13.880 --> 3:39:20.880]  Can you just say that, please? But he didn't. He said, Donald Trump's stuff is garbage.
[3:39:20.880 --> 3:39:30.880]  Okay, it's a National Enquirer stuff. And quite frankly, on these issues like this, the National Enquirer has far more credibility than Ted Cruz does.
[3:39:30.880 --> 3:39:39.880]  Remember how he lied about Ben Carson? Remember how he told everybody for a half hour, and it was a half hour.
[3:39:39.880 --> 3:39:42.880]  Look at that timeline. Again, go back and look at that timeline.
[3:39:42.880 --> 3:39:50.880]  20 minutes before the Iowa caucus has started, there were two tweets that went out by CNN at the same time, one after the other.
[3:39:50.880 --> 3:39:54.880]  When I'm saying, hey, it's weird, Ben Carson is going away, but he says he's not getting out of the race.
[3:39:54.880 --> 3:40:01.880]  They wait 20 minutes till the caucus has started and then all over Iowa, all over Iowa, just happened at the same time.
[3:40:01.880 --> 3:40:08.880]  They all say, as the caucus starts, all these Ted Cruz people are telling everybody and all the individual caucuses, hey, Ben Carson is getting out.
[3:40:08.880 --> 3:40:15.880]  And they continue to do that for another half hour until the Ben Carson people furiously started screaming, he's not getting out.
[3:40:15.880 --> 3:40:22.880]  And then they stopped. He would never, never admit that they lied about it, never take responsibility for it.
[3:40:22.880 --> 3:40:29.880]  That's why Ben Carson will not endorse Ted Cruz. Let's go back to Rob Do. Rob, you still there?
[3:40:29.880 --> 3:40:38.880]  Yeah, hey, I'm actually watching a debate between an Egyptian Muslim who came here six years, took him to get legal, and then he's debating this young fellow
[3:40:38.880 --> 3:40:42.880]  across the way who's complaining about how much it costs to become a legal citizen.
[3:40:42.880 --> 3:40:48.880]  Okay, so this is a Trump supporter that he's debating?
[3:40:48.880 --> 3:40:53.880]  So yeah, they're debating right now. I'm shooting this on YouTube, on a camera.
[3:40:53.880 --> 3:41:00.880]  And then a gentleman over here said, he came over and said, can we agree that we need to get the Illuminati out of the White House?
[3:41:00.880 --> 3:41:07.880]  And then there's another gentleman over here with a white phone. He's talking about the New World Order, trying to explain to him what the New World Order is.
[3:41:07.880 --> 3:41:12.880]  So there's a lot of interesting ideas that are going forth. Unfortunately, there's a wide gulf between the two fences.
[3:41:12.880 --> 3:41:19.880]  You could see that barrier they put up to keep people from coming together and talking to each other, because what you essentially have here,
[3:41:19.880 --> 3:41:24.880]  with all the chanting and screaming and yelling, everybody's been pretty nonviolent.
[3:41:24.880 --> 3:41:29.880]  And I've gone out to basically everyone here. I interviewed a guy with a communist flag, and he talked to me.
[3:41:29.880 --> 3:41:32.880]  And some people were like, oh, don't talk to him. Don't talk to him.
[3:41:32.880 --> 3:41:34.880]  And I just kept asking questions and they started talking.
[3:41:34.880 --> 3:41:42.880]  So I think, you know, one thing that has to happen for any change to go one way or the other. People have to talk to each other.
[3:41:42.880 --> 3:41:51.880]  That's right. You know what I saw in Washington? What I saw in Washington Rob were the protesters just repeating a three-word phrase over and over and over and over again.
[3:41:51.880 --> 3:41:58.880]  I mean, it was absolutely insane. And I'm sure that at the end of this, they turned the police and the Donald Trump voters.
[3:41:58.880 --> 3:42:05.880]  I can't imagine anybody just repeating a three-word phrase, Trump is a racist, Trump is a racist or whatever.
[3:42:05.880 --> 3:42:08.880]  And then they would go on to something else. It was a similar variation of that.
[3:42:08.880 --> 3:42:11.880]  There was no discussion. There was just shouting in people's faces.
[3:42:11.880 --> 3:42:18.880]  And I don't mind having a discussion. As I said before, I think somebody going into a rally, holding up a sign, protesting a candidate,
[3:42:18.880 --> 3:42:24.880]  saying that you have a different point of view, doing that silently so you don't disrupt the discussion of a private rally.
[3:42:24.880 --> 3:42:31.880]  I think that's perfectly legitimate. I hate to see them corral people at these political conventions into free speech areas.
[3:42:31.880 --> 3:42:34.880]  I think that is an abomination in this country. Go ahead.
[3:42:34.880 --> 3:42:40.880]  Yeah, I totally agree. And, you know, I have seen nothing but peace on both sides.
[3:42:40.880 --> 3:42:45.880]  There's some yelling. We actually saw a guy carrying a Confederate flag earlier. We think he might be a provocateur.
[3:42:45.880 --> 3:42:49.880]  We're not sure yet, but this young man over here came over. Come on over here, buddy.
[3:42:49.880 --> 3:42:55.880]  What's your name? Brandon Krauss. Brandon. And, you know, he said, hey, man, can we just get the fluoride out of the water?
[3:42:55.880 --> 3:43:00.880]  Here's somebody who's got his head screwed on straight and really wants to, you know, do something that's going to be meaningful change.
[3:43:00.880 --> 3:43:05.880]  A lot of these people, I had a discussion with a guy who's a biochemist. Couldn't tell me what hydrofluorosalic acid was.
[3:43:05.880 --> 3:43:09.880]  Didn't know that it was bad for you. Didn't know that they put it in the water and tell you to drink it.
[3:43:09.880 --> 3:43:15.880]  Yet it's supposed to be for your teeth. You know, these people don't look at the back of their toothpaste versus if you swallow this,
[3:43:15.880 --> 3:43:22.880]  call poison control immediately. You know, Rob, I thought he was going to say that the governor of Michigan ought to be impeached for fluoride in the water.
[3:43:22.880 --> 3:43:27.880]  Because I don't think he knew the difference in fluoride and lead, brother. Right, exactly.
[3:43:27.880 --> 3:43:34.880]  I mean, I think we've got to get back to the basics here and just, you know, trying to fluoride in the water.
[3:43:34.880 --> 3:43:40.880]  You know, trying to get GMOs labeled. I mean, in the fed. Yeah, in the fed, exactly.
[3:43:40.880 --> 3:43:47.880]  That's like three things right there. If we did, you know, we can start turning to stuff. Especially in the fed would clear up a lot of the money supply
[3:43:47.880 --> 3:43:54.880]  for people to actually, you know, spend and finance things. Interestingly enough, David, a cop, one of the cops earlier came up behind me
[3:43:54.880 --> 3:44:02.880]  and shook my hand. He goes, I've seen you on TV. We're big fans here. So, you know, the police, big fans of freedom, which is good to see.
[3:44:02.880 --> 3:44:07.880]  You know, that's what I really like to see. So this is good. We're having, you know, right now between this fence, it's a shame.
[3:44:07.880 --> 3:44:11.880]  We have to have a fence between people to talk. But at least people are coming together and are talking.
[3:44:11.880 --> 3:44:16.880]  I think they're kind of done screaming and chanting. So that's definitely a good sign.
[3:44:16.880 --> 3:44:20.880]  That's a good sign. All right, we'll be looking for your report tonight. Rob, thank you so much.
[3:44:20.880 --> 3:44:24.880]  Again, Rob and the Info Wars crew are there in Wisconsin where the Trump rally is going to be held.
[3:44:24.880 --> 3:44:27.880]  What is it, Rob? It's about two and a half hours or so.
[3:44:27.880 --> 3:44:32.880]  Yeah, it starts at four o'clock. I'm not even sure what time it is. We've been out here for so long.
[3:44:32.880 --> 3:44:37.880]  Spotters on the roof. They do have metal detectors out there. And I think, did you say TSA was here?
[3:44:37.880 --> 3:44:43.880]  TSA was here earlier. I'm probably setting up the metal detectors and getting them from the local airport.
[3:44:43.880 --> 3:44:52.880]  There was a SWAT van, a lot of security. Alongside the back of the hotel where the access road is, they parked snow plows there so people couldn't park.
[3:44:52.880 --> 3:44:58.880]  Probably also to keep a security perimeter. So there's definitely a heightened sense of security here overall.
[3:44:58.880 --> 3:45:03.880]  Then from what I've seen, but I haven't really been to any Trump events.
[3:45:03.880 --> 3:45:11.880]  Well, it'd be interesting to see. I know that when we were following the Pope around, the police in Washington and New York were a lot more sophisticated about crowd control.
[3:45:11.880 --> 3:45:15.880]  They didn't freak out about everything as much as they did in Philadelphia, for example.
[3:45:15.880 --> 3:45:18.880]  That was so over the top because they don't deal with that sort of thing all the time.
[3:45:18.880 --> 3:45:25.880]  And so I think when you go to some smaller towns like this, you always have to kind of wonder whether it's going...
[3:45:25.880 --> 3:45:28.880]  I'm sure the police are going to be able to handle this reasonably or not.
[3:45:28.880 --> 3:45:35.880]  They were very professional in Washington, D.C. with both the Trump rally that we went to last week and the Pope's visit.
[3:45:35.880 --> 3:45:41.880]  Also in New York, I was surprised to have the police conducted things there. They're used to that type of thing all the time.
[3:45:41.880 --> 3:45:45.880]  It's the small towns that things can sometimes get out of hand, but it looks like they've got it under control there.
[3:45:45.880 --> 3:45:51.880]  Yeah, and I think that's what happened last night too. They might have beefed it up a little more, thinking that people were going to try to rush the hotel and stop this.
[3:45:51.880 --> 3:45:55.880]  But that was literally, I think, the only time they were going to get in.
[3:45:55.880 --> 3:46:00.880]  Because when I woke up this morning, there were cops everywhere and they'd set up a perimeter.
[3:46:00.880 --> 3:46:07.880]  But I haven't seen any fights. I haven't seen anybody getting a couple of yelling matches, but really some small stuff.
[3:46:07.880 --> 3:46:14.880]  Nothing major. And so I think this one is going to be in peacefully, hopefully.
[3:46:14.880 --> 3:46:19.880]  And then we'll go on to the next one. We've got two tomorrow, one near Green Bay and one near Appleton.
[3:46:19.880 --> 3:46:25.880]  We'll be looking for those reports. That's Rob Dew and Infowars Crew in Wisconsin.
[3:46:25.880 --> 3:46:29.880]  They're at the Trump rally. Thank you very much, Rob.
[3:46:29.880 --> 3:46:33.880]  Let's talk about what the real issue is with the wives.
[3:46:33.880 --> 3:46:37.880]  We've got a story up at Infowars.com, The Wife War Distraction. This is by Kurt Nemo.
[3:46:37.880 --> 3:46:43.880]  And he points out, you know, really isn't so much this competition between the wives.
[3:46:43.880 --> 3:46:50.880]  I think that it is an issue if Ted Cruz is going to hold himself up as the face of God to America.
[3:46:50.880 --> 3:46:56.880]  But here's the real point. Well, they talked about spilling the beans. One of his spokesperson there.
[3:46:56.880 --> 3:47:03.880]  And of course, Katrina Pearson has been labeled as one of the people perhaps that Donald Trump had an affair with.
[3:47:03.880 --> 3:47:08.880]  That's total speculation. You can't tell from those National Enquirer pictures who anybody is.
[3:47:08.880 --> 3:47:14.880]  They've got bars over their faces. The faces are pixelated. And they, yeah, Ted Cruz, exactly.
[3:47:14.880 --> 3:47:20.880]  They've got bars over their faces and saying that these various women have had affairs with Ted Cruz.
[3:47:20.880 --> 3:47:28.880]  That is not anything we can label anybody with. But she did come out and say that spilling the beans is quite simple when it comes to Heidi Cruz.
[3:47:28.880 --> 3:47:36.880]  She said she worked as a George W. Bush operative. She worked as an architect of NAFTA, which has killed millions of jobs in this country.
[3:47:36.880 --> 3:47:43.880]  She was a member of the Council on Formulations who, in Senator Cruz's own words, was a nest of snakes that seeks to undermine national sovereignty.
[3:47:43.880 --> 3:47:51.880]  And Heidi Cruz has been working for Goldman Sachs, the same global bank that Ted Cruz left off of his financial disclosure.
[3:47:51.880 --> 3:47:57.880]  Her entire career has been spent working against everything that Ted Cruz says that he stands for.
[3:47:57.880 --> 3:48:05.880]  So there as well as the morality issue, every time we look at Ted Cruz, we see nothing but hypocrisy.
[3:48:05.880 --> 3:48:13.880]  And that's essentially the point. And when you look at what her influences are, when you look at this involvement that she had with the CFR,
[3:48:13.880 --> 3:48:20.880]  that was an organization looking at North American Union. So they filed a report, said, let's put all three of these countries together.
[3:48:20.880 --> 3:48:23.880]  Let's have a common border that goes around the perimeter of the three countries.
[3:48:23.880 --> 3:48:31.880]  We'll have it patrol by Homeland Security. And that was a Council on Foreign Relations Task Force that Heidi Cruz was a part of.
[3:48:31.880 --> 3:48:40.880]  It was run by Robert Zellick. This is a guy who's US Trade Representative who helped to craft these trade deals that are destroying our country.
[3:48:40.880 --> 3:48:48.880]  Let's get to the crux of the issue. As I pointed out before, we don't really have much of a choice when it comes to civil liberties with these presidential candidates.
[3:48:48.880 --> 3:48:55.880]  We do have a choice, though, when it comes to the central issues that are taking down this country.
[3:48:55.880 --> 3:49:05.880]  And that is the America last form policy of the neocons as well as these trade deals. Let's focus for a second on the foreign policy issue.
[3:49:05.880 --> 3:49:09.880]  We've got another article up on InfoWars.com. This one's from Lou Rockwell.
[3:49:09.880 --> 3:49:15.880]  It says, Murray Rothbard soars, Bill Buckley evaporates over history, and there's a lesson here.
[3:49:15.880 --> 3:49:24.880]  And he goes back and he looks at the history. Going back to late 1965, you had Murray Rothbard offered his thoughts on national review at the time.
[3:49:24.880 --> 3:49:30.880]  And he had also written a book, this full story, rather, The Betrayal of the American Right.
[3:49:30.880 --> 3:49:33.880]  At once he said it was an intellectual history and a memoir.
[3:49:33.880 --> 3:49:40.880]  He says Murray's primary complaint was that what had once been a movement that was skeptical of or opposed overseas
[3:49:40.880 --> 3:49:47.880]  adventurism and empire building had now under the influence of editor Bill Buckley come to be defined by those very things.
[3:49:47.880 --> 3:49:53.880]  Now ask yourself, when we have debates between the Democrats and Republicans, is there ever any question
[3:49:53.880 --> 3:49:58.880]  that America should be an empire, that we should be involved in every single conflict in the world?
[3:49:58.880 --> 3:50:03.880]  In many cases, we're on both sides. As a matter of fact, there was an article that we had on InfoWars.com
[3:50:03.880 --> 3:50:11.880]  talking about how we've got the Pentagon fighting the CIA in these wars. That's what it really amounts to.
[3:50:11.880 --> 3:50:16.880]  But that has become an orthodoxy that cannot be challenged.
[3:50:16.880 --> 3:50:20.880]  The mainstream media holds this up and both the left and right paradigms hold this up.
[3:50:20.880 --> 3:50:26.880]  And at the core of this, what changed with all of this, we used to have an America First Republican Party.
[3:50:26.880 --> 3:50:30.880]  And that was destroyed by William F. Buckley's National Review.
[3:50:30.880 --> 3:50:34.880]  And I wanted to read you a little bit more about this, and I don't have the time for this.
[3:50:34.880 --> 3:50:40.880]  But when we come back, I'm going to read to you from some of the transcript of the New York Times interview with Donald Trump.
[3:50:40.880 --> 3:50:46.880]  When they summed it up, they said, his worldview, America comes first. Everybody else pays.
[3:50:46.880 --> 3:50:51.880]  What's wrong with that? That's what the black gentleman that was interviewed by Rob Duce said.
[3:50:51.880 --> 3:50:55.880]  He said, hey, I'm an American. Why can't we take care of America? Why can't we have an American president who does that?

[3:52:54.880 --> 3:52:56.880]  Investments in securities involves the risk of loss.
[3:52:56.880 --> 3:53:02.880]  The following is a far too common tale of investing in annuities. A successful couple invested a large portion of their savings in annuities,
[3:53:02.880 --> 3:53:06.880]  thinking they were a safe way to guarantee a dependable income stream no matter what the market did.
[3:53:06.880 --> 3:53:08.880]  But it didn't take long for them to regret their decision.
[3:53:08.880 --> 3:53:15.880]  They were locked into low returns, faced potential tax consequences, and that they couldn't get out of their annuities without paying huge penalties.
[3:53:15.880 --> 3:53:19.880]  They were stuck and so was their money. Suddenly their retirement hopes and dreams were in danger.
[3:53:19.880 --> 3:53:22.880]  But it didn't have to happen to them and it doesn't have to happen to you.
[3:53:22.880 --> 3:53:24.880]  You can avoid the annuity trap.

[3:53:59.880 --> 3:54:02.880]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight in this last segment.
[3:54:02.880 --> 3:54:09.880]  I want to go back and talk about the history of how the neocons have taken over the public debate, how they have established...
[3:54:09.880 --> 3:54:16.880]  What the mainstream media tells us is an unchallengeable orthodoxy, and yet Donald Trump is challenging it.
[3:54:16.880 --> 3:54:24.880]  It's why National Review took out an entire magazine, unprecedented for them, an entire magazine, to try to shut down Donald Trump.
[3:54:24.880 --> 3:54:28.880]  Before we do, I want to tell you real quickly we've got a couple of specials that are going to be ending tomorrow.

[3:55:06.880 --> 3:55:14.880]  Now, as I was pointing out, we have this article on infowars.com comparing Murray Rothbard's influence to Bill Buckley and the National Review's influence.
[3:55:14.880 --> 3:55:18.880]  Talking about how the National Review is declining, and there are very good reasons for that.
[3:55:18.880 --> 3:55:22.880]  And we're seeing the desperation of the GOP establishment.
[3:55:22.880 --> 3:55:30.880]  And of course, the National Review is the mouthpiece for the GOP establishment, for the globalist, elitist trade deals,
[3:55:30.880 --> 3:55:40.880]  and for the forever wars that have been given to us by the neo-conservatives. And we call them neo-conservatives because it is a new kind of conservatism.
[3:55:40.880 --> 3:55:45.880]  It was a new kind of conservatism that was embodied by the National Review and William F. Buckley.
[3:55:45.880 --> 3:55:52.880]  And we look at this article, and I want you to read this article at infowars.com. It will really fill in the history for you.
[3:55:52.880 --> 3:56:02.880]  As he points out here, Lou Rockwell said, well before there was an official conservative movement with all of its magazines, with its crusty orthodoxies, with its ineffectual think tanks,
[3:56:02.880 --> 3:56:13.880]  and its craving for respectability, there was a less formal, a loose association of writers and intellectuals who opposed FDR in both his domestic and his foreign policies,
[3:56:13.880 --> 3:56:22.880]  a group that Murray Rothbard dubbed the old right. There was no party line among those intrepid thinkers, he says, because there was nobody to impose one.
[3:56:22.880 --> 3:56:30.880]  Then we had the National Review. We had William F. Buckley come along, and they have sold us the idea that we need to be the world's policeman.
[3:56:30.880 --> 3:56:36.880]  He says, with the advent of the National Review, these increasingly isolated voices would be silenced. They would be marginalized.
[3:56:36.880 --> 3:56:43.880]  Even the heroic John T. Flynn, whose anti-FDR biography, The Roosevelt Myth, had reached number two on the New York Times bestseller list,
[3:56:43.880 --> 3:56:49.880]  was turned away from National Review when he tried to warn of the dangers of a policy of military interventionism.
[3:56:49.880 --> 3:56:55.880]  In my time, I remember Joe Sobran, who used to be the editor of the National Review.
[3:56:55.880 --> 3:57:01.880]  And as he became a non-interventionist, he was attacked by William F. Buckley, who was driven out of the magazine,
[3:57:01.880 --> 3:57:11.880]  tried to drive him out of politics in general, tried to discredit him, not on the issue of non-interventionism.
[3:57:11.880 --> 3:57:18.880]  No, he tried to discredit him on the issue of racism. Do you see how National Review uses the tactics that the left uses?
[3:57:18.880 --> 3:57:29.880]  It's because it's the same people at the top, the same people are beholden to the multinational corporations who are writing these trade agreements that are destroying our country.
[3:57:29.880 --> 3:57:41.880]  And so he uses the issue of racism. He says, oh, you're not a non-interventionist, you're a anti-Semite because you don't give Israel a pass and put their concerns ahead of ours.
[3:57:41.880 --> 3:57:48.880]  Now, when I look at this massive transcript from the New York Times, they talked to Donald Trump, here's some of the things that suck out to me, of course.
[3:57:48.880 --> 3:57:56.880]  One of the things he says, at some point, we cannot be the policemen of the world. That's right. We're the unpaid mercenaries of the world.
[3:57:56.880 --> 3:58:04.880]  We've acted as the world's mercenaries and they don't even pass. We're not even real mercenaries. But he says, at some point, we can't do this anymore.
[3:58:04.880 --> 3:58:15.880]  That's the reality, folks. No matter how much you love the policies of the globalists, no matter how much you love this managed trade that's going to be managed offshore, where they manage our economies,
[3:58:15.880 --> 3:58:20.880]  no matter how much you think we ought to be the policemen of the world, you can't keep it up.
[3:58:20.880 --> 3:58:27.880]  All empires collapse from their overreach. Donald Trump understands that, I think, the American people do as well.
