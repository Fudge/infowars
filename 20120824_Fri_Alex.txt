[00:00.000 --> 00:13.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.520 --> 00:36.480]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well my friends
[00:36.480 --> 00:42.760]  we've got mass shootings going on around the country and the usual refrain is ban our
[00:42.760 --> 00:52.040]  guns out of 312 million people you might have a hundred people a year maybe in the worst
[00:52.040 --> 00:57.240]  years dying what they call a mass shooting that's above five people and in most cases
[00:57.240 --> 01:04.920]  is gang related the numbers are less than 20 in crazy man related stuff it's gang related
[01:04.920 --> 01:10.680]  and it's work related then it's crazy people on Prozac that's the statistics you can look
[01:10.680 --> 01:14.400]  it up back to I have some of them here in front of me curtain ammo I wrote an article
[01:14.400 --> 01:17.560]  about it a few weeks ago and another one just a few days ago going over the statistics
[01:17.560 --> 01:23.960]  of that gunman kills co-worker and bystander at Empire State Building when seven others
[01:23.960 --> 01:30.200]  before cops shooting now that's in a city where it's illegal to own a gun unless you're
[01:30.200 --> 01:33.720]  a gangster and pay hundreds of thousands of dollars of politicians for them to give you
[01:33.720 --> 01:38.360]  a little permit first they said oh everybody could have a gun just get a permit and then
[01:38.360 --> 01:43.240]  oh we don't give permits out anymore so it has one of the highest crime rates in the country
[01:43.240 --> 01:49.400]  now who has the highest crime rate in the world though is Chicago where they have just absolute
[01:49.400 --> 01:56.940]  draconian anti-gun laws gunmans like Washington DC which is after Chicago the next highest
[01:56.940 --> 02:02.520]  crime rate in New York as you know and it's all places where they have victim disarmament
[02:02.520 --> 02:07.000]  and court of course world years ago you can have a gun in DC but the city never really
[02:07.000 --> 02:12.680]  changed the laws they don't care the criminals so they had two shootings in New York it's
[02:12.680 --> 02:21.800]  a long hot dirty summer and a lot of grunge a lot of people angry a lot of hot concrete
[02:21.800 --> 02:29.640]  melting through people's shoes and melted into their tempers and so we also had a shootout
[02:29.640 --> 02:34.840]  over a hot dog stand over guys fighting over territory over that things are getting rough
[02:34.840 --> 02:40.960]  out there in the deep global recession slash depression and you're going to see people
[02:40.960 --> 02:48.920]  fraying at the edges in fact in Chicago 19 people were shot overnight that's in the Chicago
[02:48.920 --> 02:56.000]  Tribune now that story is hardly in the news but you would think the end of the world came
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.840]  because the Empire State Building oh my gosh somebody went and shot a co-worker and then
[03:00.840 --> 03:05.400]  threw a fit and shot some more people injuring them thank God they're not dead and then the
[03:05.400 --> 03:10.920]  cops kill them and they you know use him the number of two dead speaking of that the Norway
[03:10.920 --> 03:16.560]  shooter has been found to be sane is going to be given what is it 12 to 20 years my goodness
[03:16.560 --> 03:22.960]  that guy should be getting life in prison but that's how this whole system works where
[03:22.960 --> 03:29.720]  they let violent offenders out and throw the book at nonviolent offenders that's the liberal
[03:29.720 --> 03:37.480]  way it's not liberal it's designed to destroy society they know exactly what they're doing
[03:37.480 --> 03:44.800]  it's designed to rot society but 19 people shot in overnight shootings across Chicago
[03:44.800 --> 03:50.680]  and of course 13 of them wounded over a 30 minute period alone in gang related attacks
[03:50.680 --> 03:58.080]  and robberies and things and the government's answer is put more people on welfare and disarm
[03:58.080 --> 04:07.480]  the public and never mention that this is gang warfare and just have the mayor the gangster
[04:07.480 --> 04:12.560]  come out over Chicago land and and call for banning my guns in Texas Bloomberg does this
[04:12.560 --> 04:16.480]  to a New York he'll guarantee come out with a statement like he always does suing different
[04:16.480 --> 04:22.160]  states suing gun manufacturers blaming me in Austin Texas blaming you and other parts
[04:22.160 --> 04:27.360]  of the country where we don't live in giant crime infested warrants now there's a lot
[04:27.360 --> 04:34.520]  of people in New York City a lot of nice folks in Chicago but they are mafia run hell pits
[04:34.520 --> 04:38.560]  where people have five six seven locks and they cower with a baseball bat with their
[04:38.560 --> 04:45.840]  family and get raped and robbed I mean it's just pathetic pathetic legalized guns so lawful
[04:45.840 --> 04:51.680]  people good people can carry guns and these crime rates will plunge instead you got a
[04:51.680 --> 04:57.040]  bunch of gang bangers and thugs along with criminal police forces sucking off everyone

[09:00.440 --> 09:07.800]  down some solutions as well later here on the broadcast with dr peter glidden dealing with
[09:07.800 --> 09:14.040]  the medical mafia and how they can be exposed and derailed we've got john whitehead the lawyer
[09:14.840 --> 09:24.040]  for our listener the marine uh highly decorated honorably discharged brandon rob who was released
[09:24.040 --> 09:28.760]  yesterday from a psychiatric facility were saying that 9-11 was an inside job and the
[09:28.760 --> 09:33.320]  federal reserve was private and the psychiatrist came in and told him that was mental illness
[09:33.320 --> 09:38.040]  and that he was going to quote brainwashing and forcibly drugging trying to make him get mad and
[09:38.040 --> 09:43.160]  throw a fit that didn't work they did that right before they knew the hearing was coming up just
[09:43.160 --> 09:50.280]  amazing inside info from the lawyer the founder and head of the rutherford institute who i interviewed
[09:50.280 --> 09:54.680]  on the nightly news last night he'll have even more breaking news for us and mr rob will join us

[10:01.080 --> 10:06.840]  trying to break him inside the enemy command base and that's what these are the soviets used it the
[10:06.840 --> 10:13.560]  nazis used it the chikams used it the north koreans uh the the the special psychiatric
[10:13.560 --> 10:19.240]  wards and the federal grants they now have to go after veterans specifically and paul watson's
[10:19.240 --> 10:27.640]  got a big article on that front up at info wars dot com veteran declared mentally defective has
[10:27.640 --> 10:37.560]  guns seized a national pattern is developing uh of veterans being targeted and having their
[10:38.680 --> 10:47.000]  firearms taken no judge no jury if you show any any political acumen or make any uh political
[10:47.000 --> 10:53.560]  statements they come after you and come after you big time in fact watson is just a very prolific
[10:53.560 --> 10:57.880]  writer and researcher but that's a great headline i know he's listening so i'll just operate as editor
[10:57.880 --> 11:02.280]  override editor here on air let's put that headline back up for me thank you veteran
[11:03.720 --> 11:07.880]  uh declared mentally defective has guns seized news of similar cases emerges day after release
[11:07.880 --> 11:14.520]  of brandon rob yeah i think that's a good headline but my point is it's definitely a national
[11:14.520 --> 11:22.120]  national trend has emerged they are targeting veterans for no reason extra judicially for
[11:22.120 --> 11:27.400]  mild statements about i think things are about to collapse we better get ourselves in gear and get
[11:27.400 --> 11:33.880]  ready hi we're from the fbi what does that mean exactly get ready i don't know you're digging

[12:04.120 --> 12:10.120]  amendment a first amendment's a weapon you better get that through your head and use it
[12:10.120 --> 12:16.120]  don't apologize for it get aggressive or this and you fbi agents and all the rest of you following
[12:16.120 --> 12:22.120]  these stupid orders you better start saying no i've seen the atf video that wasn't supposed to be
[12:22.120 --> 12:26.680]  released where the director's going we're going to grind down on the people you better watch it you

[12:32.440 --> 12:37.400]  blow with that group of criminals this is a narcotics trafficking murdering mafia they've
[12:37.400 --> 12:43.160]  been caught doing it it's in federal court the atf is a criminal enterprise going back over
[12:43.160 --> 12:49.080]  150 years before they were called the atf you know about the whiskey rebellions you know about
[12:49.080 --> 12:56.040]  whiskey taxes folks would make their own moonshine and sell it and the feds would want taxes off of
[12:56.040 --> 13:04.760]  it that's what the atf is the atf was murdering bounty hunters that would go around robbing families
[13:04.760 --> 13:09.480]  not just people running stills but they would go in and just take whatever they wanted at your farm
[13:10.840 --> 13:16.840]  the atf is a criminal organization period period
[13:19.000 --> 13:26.120]  of course they were involved in waco ruby ridge of course they were running oklahoma city of course
[13:26.120 --> 13:31.960]  they ran fast and furious of course they've been caught shipping in thousands of tons of drugs
[13:31.960 --> 13:37.400]  on record it comes out in the el paso time chicago tribune none of them get in trouble
[13:37.960 --> 13:44.840]  you think it's fun to get up here and expose known murdering gang a pack of criminals it's
[13:44.840 --> 13:57.720]  got to be done though okay point is we have john whitehead joining us with new information coming
[13:57.720 --> 14:02.040]  up at the bottom of the hour richard belzer who got cut short with the day of my stand exclusive
[14:02.040 --> 14:05.720]  last week where he wanted to get his statement out on air he's going to be joining us he got
[14:05.720 --> 14:13.480]  censored a few days ago on cnn we're going to get into that with the law and order tv star movie
[14:13.480 --> 14:18.920]  star i mean i can't even go over the last week also popped in was christopher walken with
[14:19.480 --> 14:25.080]  so who knows what surprises there'll be today and then dr peter glenn but it just exhaust me to see
[14:25.080 --> 14:28.680]  all of this going on dr peter glenn has been so requested so we're going to go more into the
[14:28.680 --> 14:33.800]  history boy he knows his stuff of medical tyranny now this is all planned uh that's going to be
[14:33.800 --> 14:43.320]  riveting information the truth will set us free uh that is uh coming up and we are also going to
[14:43.320 --> 14:49.960]  get into the economic news uh some in fact we're going to do that here in just a moment do that
[14:49.960 --> 14:56.520]  right now odds of global recession are 100% says mark faber who's a guest here on this broadcast
[14:57.480 --> 15:02.760]  very well respected economist researcher and uh the word is there's no way to reverse this now
[15:02.760 --> 15:07.880]  the globalist engineered it but there's no way to reverse now what they put in motion once they
[15:08.520 --> 15:13.640]  once it goes past a certain point and that's why they're arming up to the teeth against us
[15:13.640 --> 15:18.120]  but if we try to dig in and get ready well well we're bad we're supposed to just
[15:18.120 --> 15:23.000]  live in new york or chicago and have gangs feeding on us and thug police feeding on us
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.640]  and have that as the new model of america you notice who runs america the mafia out of chicago
[15:27.640 --> 15:32.840]  and the mafia out of new york and the mafia out of dc and the model of hell that they've created
[15:33.800 --> 15:38.200]  is what they're exporting into every town and city they come and train our police
[15:38.200 --> 15:43.320]  and we now operate like they do what a joke and again i'm not against folks in chicago
[15:43.320 --> 15:48.760]  or people in new york they're really nice people but they they have just been in a culture of
[15:48.760 --> 15:57.560]  corruption so long i mean i've actually studied the anthropology the sociology of chicago and new
[15:57.560 --> 16:04.760]  york you know why those cities are so corrupt right because they were giant second wave well
[16:04.760 --> 16:10.360]  new york first wave but also second and third wave immigration sites and you had millions
[16:10.360 --> 16:16.920]  of people that couldn't speak english who could be abused by old world crime syndicates they
[16:16.920 --> 16:22.440]  were not the original puritans that found in this country who weren't perfect either but would
[16:24.920 --> 16:31.080]  die trying or succeeding i mean they would either stand up against you if you try to
[16:31.080 --> 16:39.720]  enslave them or die fighting against it and uh had some of their own forms of tyranny but the
[16:39.720 --> 16:45.880]  point is those people wouldn't put up with anything and that's what caused 1776 and the rest of it
[16:45.880 --> 16:52.440]  but you got these third second and third and fourth wave immigrants coming in with the organized crime
[16:52.440 --> 17:00.680]  behind them feeding on them and just taking over so this un-american system has grown up out of
[17:00.680 --> 17:08.040]  these cities and these were great immigrants from from ireland and germany and idli and and and
[17:08.040 --> 17:14.760]  romania and all these places it's just that they came here greek you name it but with the crime
[17:14.760 --> 17:20.280]  behind them and this is the system they run of patronage and and mafia and control and i don't
[17:20.280 --> 17:26.280]  like it and it doesn't fly down here in texas i'll tell you that right now one of the last vestiges
[17:26.280 --> 17:32.920]  of what was this country was founded on and we need to export our ideas against the tyrants against
[17:32.920 --> 17:38.120]  the thugs and the criminals and just say hey we'll take good old-fashioned private property liberty
[17:38.120 --> 17:45.080]  the family freedom men or men women or women and we're not going to be bossed around but
[17:45.080 --> 17:49.560]  your political correctness we're not going to be told what we better do and you know what
[17:50.520 --> 17:57.320]  you want to fight you got one how's that sound you want to fight you got one okay we're not here
[17:57.320 --> 18:02.440]  to be run over and we're not backing down and whatever happens happens we're all in how do you

[18:11.320 --> 18:18.520]  we're done we're not intimidated we're not scared and you know it you know it so you go ahead and
[18:18.520 --> 18:22.920]  start your fight so we have the moral authority and when you bomb stuff and try to blame it on us
[18:22.920 --> 18:29.480]  we're going to expose it you we're going to get you and you know it you're all going to jail
[18:29.480 --> 18:36.600]  like Bernie Madoff and Ken Lay you bit off more than you can chew and you could feel it all collapsing
[18:36.600 --> 18:42.520]  underneath it can't you go ahead and buy another 1.4 billion bullets go ahead blow up another federal
[18:42.520 --> 18:48.520]  building and blame it on us it isn't going to fly go ahead and shut the internet off go ahead pull it
[18:48.520 --> 18:57.640]  all bust a cap in the patriot leadership that'll make us a thousand times stronger you are going down
[18:57.640 --> 19:04.360]  I know it and you just better hope all the churches your only hope your only hope is the
[19:04.360 --> 19:12.680]  devil's right hand these 501c3 churches and synagogues of Satan your only hope is those 501c3s

[27:59.320 --> 28:04.200]  there and watch the television set and they think if you're awake and animated and smart and have
[28:04.200 --> 28:08.920]  the fires of liberty in your mind you're strange you're supposed to be some drooling zombie
[28:08.920 --> 28:14.200]  shuffling around watching sports all day or if you're a woman primping all day obsessing over
[28:14.200 --> 28:22.520]  what you look like instead of absolute life going on all around us incredible hundreds of billions of
[28:22.520 --> 28:30.440]  galaxies star systems incredible beauty everywhere creativity the dynamic human spirit and these

[34:23.080 --> 34:28.920]  going to get to that in a moment i'm ranting a few program notes what we sold out we sold
[34:30.280 --> 34:37.240]  86 000 copies well 50 000 went on the street and then another 30 something thousand of the

[34:43.720 --> 34:49.240]  we've held back uh four thousand because in a month or so we're going to start subscriptions
[34:49.240 --> 34:53.880]  she can have that first issue and then 12 issues forward of the new info wars magazine

[35:28.040 --> 35:32.520]  we put 50 000 the streets of austin they've almost all been picked up everywhere there's been like a
[35:32.520 --> 35:38.120]  run on them so uh obviously uh we're going to have to increase the price of the introductory
[35:38.120 --> 35:41.800]  advertising i mean i knew that because i might have to print more i have to make the money to be
[35:41.800 --> 35:47.560]  able to print enough i mean we might put out 200 000 next month i mean i i don't know and we're
[35:47.560 --> 35:51.240]  going to have franchisees we're going to get other versions printed all over the country
[35:51.240 --> 35:58.520]  very exciting that's happening but if you didn't get an inaugural issue we think 4 000 and probably
[35:58.520 --> 36:03.320]  get more than 4 000 people you know sign up right away for subscriptions so we got 4 000 of them back
[36:03.960 --> 36:07.880]  um and again i would have printed hundreds of thousands more but i i don't have the shipping
[36:07.880 --> 36:11.560]  crew to do it so we had to we're going to have to make some changes if this keeps growing that fast
[36:11.560 --> 36:16.760]  okay enough from me on that subject uh coming up we'll get into some of the shootings around the
[36:16.760 --> 36:22.840]  country that are in victim disarmament zones total gunmans in new york couple shootings over hot dog

[36:28.840 --> 36:33.880]  overnight in chicago and gang related stuff that's kept real quiet but they want to hype up the other
[36:33.880 --> 36:38.840]  thing so bloomberg can sue people for their guns now we're going to the founder uh back in the 80s
[36:38.840 --> 36:42.600]  of one of the preeminent civil rights groups out there that across the board he writes for
[36:42.600 --> 36:47.160]  lou rockwell dot com as well uh whether you're a conservative liberal libertarian constitutionalist
[36:47.160 --> 36:53.400]  socialist uh devil worshipper i mean i mean i guess everything he will support your rights
[36:53.400 --> 36:58.120]  and and his group of lawyers will john whitehead joined us last night with some chilling info i
[36:58.120 --> 37:04.760]  wanted to recap uh he went in before the judge pointed out that um mr robb was completely
[37:04.760 --> 37:09.480]  cogent and didn't do anything wrong this is a dangerous precedent we've now learned it's a national
[37:09.480 --> 37:15.320]  thing that's happening all over a talk show host we've had on her being a are being grabbed and and
[37:15.320 --> 37:20.360]  taken and having their guns taken for saying man the economy's collapsing i'm buying more guns i mean
[37:20.360 --> 37:25.880]  this is how the soviet union did it it's very chilling brandon robb persecuted again and the
[37:25.880 --> 37:30.360]  head of the rutherford institute went in there yesterday got him out uh you know the judge you
[37:30.360 --> 37:34.840]  know repudiated what they've done but there's not that many good judges like this so to give us the
[37:34.840 --> 37:39.880]  latest update but also recap what's happened the chilling behavior of the psychiatrist the family
[37:39.880 --> 37:45.720]  planning to sue which is important so that you know the the uh tyrants don't set precedence to get
[37:45.720 --> 37:51.240]  away with this joins us now uh john whitehead good to have you on with us hey thank you sir
[37:51.240 --> 37:55.720]  okay recap of the the case for new listeners that may have missed it and then what happened
[37:55.720 --> 37:59.720]  with the judge and then and then the latest info you've gotten by the way you were talking about
[37:59.720 --> 38:03.640]  psychiatrists i have a psychologist friend came in my office the other day you know he was visiting
[38:03.640 --> 38:07.880]  me and he says you know something whitehead you have a psychological disorder i said well i've
[38:07.880 --> 38:14.920]  heard that before i said what which one is this he said odd and i said what is odd he said oppositional
[38:14.920 --> 38:23.160]  defiant disorder that's actually a disorder in the psychiatric uh dictionary so it's considered
[38:23.160 --> 38:28.920]  if you if you defy authority that's automatically considered a psychological disorder so you're
[38:28.920 --> 38:38.280]  correct wow wow but anyway brandon robb uh he's actually arrived at home uh he was released yesterday
[38:39.000 --> 38:43.480]  as people know the story uh last thursday the police arrived at his home said he committed no
[38:43.480 --> 38:48.840]  crime but he had done some facebook posts they arrested him in his short shoving the police car
[38:48.840 --> 38:54.280]  took him to the police station turned him over to a male institution and uh he was there approximately
[38:54.280 --> 38:59.480]  a week and we got a judge yesterday to say there was no factual basis to keep him in the institution
[38:59.480 --> 39:04.920]  he was to be released immediately and i just had a reporter called me from that county he says john
[39:04.920 --> 39:09.960]  we just discovered there was 20 other people in this county alone that were arrested like that
[39:09.960 --> 39:15.800]  just this month so and this is happening all over the country uh in virginia alone over 20
[39:15.800 --> 39:23.080]  thousand people are civilly committed each year in virginia alone like this so the thing was i'd
[39:23.080 --> 39:28.920]  say it here and it's important for uh people who really love their country and want freedom uh what
[39:28.920 --> 39:33.720]  his mom did was great she got out on facebook the internet started screaming about this we were
[39:33.720 --> 39:38.280]  alerted and we got involved but without that folks i think there are a lot a lot of a lot of people
[39:38.280 --> 39:43.160]  in america disappearing but uh what i'm hearing from the veterans groups is there are a lot of
[39:43.160 --> 39:48.440]  veterans oh absolutely let me stop you because we could open the phones up now and load them
[39:48.440 --> 39:53.320]  with veterans that have been grabbed for no reason i mean if they say i hate obama he's a piece of
[39:53.320 --> 39:58.680]  garbage or i hate this they show up the secret service have them fired and then they're grabbed
[39:58.680 --> 40:05.160]  and taken away some of them never come back others they take their guns this is a new creeping
[40:05.160 --> 40:11.720]  authoritarian uh disappearance thing that is happening and you just blew me away this is amazing
[40:11.720 --> 40:15.880]  you got called by reporter please give us the tales because we're going to write a story about this
[40:15.880 --> 40:19.320]  and i know you've also been writing articles and press releases they're on your site we're going to
[40:19.320 --> 40:23.480]  give that out in a moment but this is going to be big national news i would imagine uh now the
[40:23.480 --> 40:27.560]  drudge report will probably want to look at this i mean this is a big deal you're saying in one
[40:27.560 --> 40:33.720]  county that the county where he was arrested and taken away the reporters said we were surprised
[40:33.720 --> 40:39.720]  we checked into it 20 people just this month have been taken away like that in chesterfield
[40:39.720 --> 40:44.840]  county virginia that's what the reporter told me he said this is pretty freaky stuff and i said
[40:44.840 --> 40:51.560]  that's right and so but uh other states across the country have these statutes it allows the
[40:51.560 --> 40:55.560]  police to come to your home you committed no crime to arrest you and put you in a middle
[40:55.560 --> 41:00.120]  institution the thing is though like i said his mom got out there and alerted people most people
[41:00.120 --> 41:05.880]  disappear i mean once they put you on medications you're there forever and i suspect and we're
[41:05.880 --> 41:10.600]  researching this now that the middle institutions especially groups like the va probably get some
[41:10.600 --> 41:16.440]  kind of funding for the people that are placed in there otherwise there's really it makes no
[41:16.440 --> 41:20.200]  sense can you tell us uh the reporter that called you i mean was this off record because
[41:21.400 --> 41:24.920]  an off record he just said it shocks me he was interviewing me he just stopped in the middle
[41:24.920 --> 41:29.000]  of the sentence he said you're right about the civil commitment procedure it's a little strange
[41:29.720 --> 41:36.360]  well you know uh and you said at the old sylvia union in america if the police are going to arrest
[41:36.360 --> 41:42.840]  you you should have at least be suspected of committing a crime all brandon robb did is quote
[41:42.840 --> 41:46.760]  lyrics from a group called swollen members by by the way i didn't think they were very great
[41:46.760 --> 41:53.720]  lyrics but uh that's all he did he he was exercising his pre-speech and a private grouping on facebook
[41:53.720 --> 41:59.960]  somehow the government got in there and conducted surveillance got the quotes and used those against
[41:59.960 --> 42:04.120]  him he didn't target anybody and he doesn't even own a weapon so this guy is not dangerous but
[42:04.120 --> 42:11.320]  uh i don't uh anybody in authority when we moved into a police state a surveillance state anybody
[42:11.320 --> 42:17.000]  that speaks out is can be targeted and uh i'm so visible if you the more visible you are like you
[42:17.000 --> 42:23.560]  alex the less chance of someone like you being taken away but if you're brandon robb uh um 26
[42:23.560 --> 42:29.960]  year old kid in chesterfield county virginia yeah you can disappear well let's be clear historically
[42:29.960 --> 42:36.680]  the answer is for everybody to speak out now because if they're able to buffalo us and get this through
[42:36.680 --> 42:43.400]  they're going to continue it undoubtedly there's now a national program nationwide sweeping veterans
[42:43.400 --> 42:48.120]  up in many cases for literally nothing i mean they're bold enough now to go out for talk show hosts
[42:48.120 --> 42:53.240]  that have pretty good followings so if they can you know go after these smaller fish they can go
[42:53.240 --> 42:59.320]  after us tomorrow we've got to hang together or hang separate as our forebears said we're now
[42:59.320 --> 43:05.800]  to that point with the 20th century 21st century favorite model of using the psychiatric system
[43:06.440 --> 43:11.480]  to go after people and then you were telling me on air but also some off air some of the things
[43:11.480 --> 43:18.040]  the psychiatrist were saying to him obviously trying to antagonize him uh can you go over uh
[43:18.040 --> 43:23.720]  what they were saying to mr robb well uh brandon called me yesterday this is before we got the court
[43:23.720 --> 43:29.480]  order and he called me he wasn't in the panic but he said i'm really a little freak and i said why
[43:29.480 --> 43:35.960]  what's going on and he said well uh a psychiatrist just came in he gave me the name of the psychiatrist
[43:35.960 --> 43:40.840]  we're checking him out but he said the psychiatrist pulled up a chair and closed the door and sat in
[43:40.840 --> 43:46.360]  front of him and said i'm going to brainwash you and he went what he said and if you don't listen
[43:46.360 --> 43:51.560]  to me i'm going to force medication so brandon had the ability to call out with a social worker
[43:51.560 --> 43:55.720]  setting beside me he said what should i do well in virginia you have to have a court order to
[43:55.720 --> 44:01.960]  force medication i said tell the man that he's violating the law so thank god about an hour
[44:01.960 --> 44:07.240]  later we got the court order and got him out of there but they that would that actually occur i mean
[44:07.240 --> 44:12.760]  brandon robb is as lucid as anybody i've ever known he's a bright kid again as you know he's a
[44:12.760 --> 44:23.640]  decorated marine this is showing stuff it's crazy amazing now now continuing to go over uh all of
[44:23.640 --> 44:28.280]  this information with the founder of the rutherford institute john whitehead with us right now
[44:30.280 --> 44:34.680]  i want to go back to the reporter and please tell us his name because we'd like to call him
[44:34.680 --> 44:39.000]  and get him on as a guest email that to you i really don't i don't have his name i mean i don't
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.120]  i don't remember his name i know you've been on a whole bunch how many shows you've been on the
[44:42.120 --> 44:48.520]  last 24 hours the last week i've been on so many shows that i i sleep well at night let's put it
[44:48.520 --> 44:54.600]  that way but what we what we've moved into is a psychotherapeutic state that's exactly where
[44:54.600 --> 44:59.480]  we're headed it's it's very similar they also at union but then they use gestapo tactics
[44:59.480 --> 45:04.040]  like they did in nazi germany they just show up at your door right now and what people have to
[45:04.040 --> 45:07.720]  understand is you got to know your rights but here's the other thing i'm encouraging people to
[45:07.720 --> 45:13.080]  call your congress fund there should be an investigation into this there should be a
[45:13.080 --> 45:18.920]  committee hearings on what's happening in this country they should we need access to fbi records
[45:19.480 --> 45:25.160]  how they're categorizing people uh you're familiar with national security letters right yes they're
[45:25.160 --> 45:30.520]  issuing so many of those well i won't want to cuss that darn things that they're everywhere what
[45:30.520 --> 45:34.280]  they do is they just show up with a letter saying we need this we want this information
[45:34.280 --> 45:39.720]  well the cell phone companies google they're handing over all this information to the police in fact
[45:39.720 --> 45:44.680]  they're actually making money off of it some cell phone companies have have sections where they sell
[45:44.680 --> 45:50.680]  to police photos and information on them let's be clear without warrants now they have these
[45:50.680 --> 45:56.600]  national security stamps they claim were just for al-qaeda just six years ago bush was lying and
[45:56.600 --> 46:01.160]  saying i promise we don't spy on any americans then it came out of course they were now it's just
[46:01.160 --> 46:06.280]  yeah we're doing everything we want and now because you quoted some lyrics we're going to
[46:06.280 --> 46:11.400]  disappear you it's absolutely amazing yeah no warrants this is the fbi and the fbi shows that
[46:11.400 --> 46:16.280]  let me know i've written about the fbi they're they're new they have a new manual which allows them
[46:16.280 --> 46:20.360]  basically to go they're going into the peace activists homes and they're going and rums you
[46:20.360 --> 46:24.760]  around in their addicts trying to find anything to use against them and here's the question i get
[46:24.760 --> 46:30.440]  all the time well john if i've done nothing wrong why should i be concerned well you should be
[46:30.440 --> 46:34.840]  concerned if you believe in the constitution because it's against the law the second thing is
[46:35.800 --> 46:39.320]  you need to teach your children now if your children do something silly on facebook and
[46:39.320 --> 46:43.560]  they want to be a federal judge someday that's all going in a file the national security agency
[46:43.560 --> 46:49.880]  keeps all that 1.6 million bits of information downloaded by the national security agency every
[46:49.880 --> 46:54.600]  day from the internet and let's be clear you're talking about sneak and peek where even if you
[46:54.600 --> 47:01.320]  catch him in your house planting stuff uh you know government breaking in your house you're not
[47:01.320 --> 47:06.760]  allowed to even tell anybody they were there i mean that is kafka-esque oh yeah and they you know
[47:06.760 --> 47:11.400]  there's a gag order on the national security letters you cannot that they're they're told they
[47:11.400 --> 47:17.160]  cannot reveal that the fbi's been there looking through your records so we moved into uh an
[47:17.160 --> 47:22.040]  orwellian state op the end of the word orwellian it's beyond that it's minority report it's everything
[47:22.040 --> 47:28.360]  philip k dick and the great sci-fi writers wrote about it's uh fact has become fiction we're there
[47:28.360 --> 47:32.840]  so what can we do i mean people better try i stopped watching television two years ago
[47:33.560 --> 47:39.240]  there's no news on tv you can get news uh from your shows and what i call the underground press
[47:39.240 --> 47:44.200]  and the underground pop shows uh that's where you can get the news you go on websites and read
[47:44.200 --> 47:50.520]  get informed don't worry what brad pit did last week worry about what the fbi did last week or
[47:50.520 --> 47:55.160]  your local police so the local police now are hooked into all the national intelligence agencies
[47:55.720 --> 48:00.520]  and when they get their drone in a couple of years they're going to be flying over your home folks
[48:01.160 --> 48:04.680]  well i've already seen a drone here in austin and ran into the operator uh
[48:05.400 --> 48:11.240]  joseph farrer of world net daily out in his rural area in virginia got buzzed uh by a police drone
[48:11.240 --> 48:17.400]  over his house this is happening everywhere but this is correct this is so draconian
[48:17.400 --> 48:23.720]  men that quietly they're changing state laws or quietly they're twisting existing laws and in one
[48:23.720 --> 48:28.600]  county you have a reporter locally call you and go yeah the last month 20 people you know mainly
[48:28.600 --> 48:36.120]  veterans were grabbed just like this and they are literally in there processing them in removing
[48:36.120 --> 48:42.200]  their rights extra judicially and kicking them back out if they're lucky and we know what the
[48:42.200 --> 48:47.800]  psychiatric system does with foster children on average they're on seven drugs they put 69
[48:47.800 --> 48:54.680]  percent of them nationally within two months on a psychotropic drug uh they are they are just
[48:54.680 --> 48:59.960]  turning them into special needs children so the state can suck more federal money i mean this is
[48:59.960 --> 49:07.720]  basically a concentration camp type operation running right under our noses yeah the word i use
[49:07.720 --> 49:12.440]  fort and i've written on it it's called the electronic concentration camp we are there and
[49:12.440 --> 49:17.720]  you through you could live in caves and get away but caves are rather are rather sparse these days
[49:17.720 --> 49:24.360]  you can't flee from it but you can resist it and that's the key uh congress needs to have a national
[49:24.360 --> 49:28.360]  investigation here we need to embarrass those guys you say they represent us in the united
[49:28.360 --> 49:33.560]  states congress which most of them don't in my opinion and force them to look into this matter i
[49:33.560 --> 49:39.880]  mean uh we're supposed to be under the rule of law but we're not under the rule of law the law is the
[49:39.880 --> 49:44.760]  constitution the constitution says in our fourth amendment before the police conduct surveillance
[49:44.760 --> 49:50.280]  on you they have to have credible evidence you're doing something illegal well they arrive and rest
[49:50.280 --> 49:56.920]  arrest brandon raw because he did some facebook posts so we moved into a new phase we're not
[49:56.920 --> 50:01.800]  under the rule of law but the only hope is in my opinion if we're going to have any system
[50:01.800 --> 50:06.360]  in our rights is to force congress to do an investigation and that's going to take a lot of
[50:06.360 --> 50:10.520]  it's going to take some picketing it's veteran groups by the way have called me they're going to do
[50:10.520 --> 50:16.280]  some national picketing on this issue that's a good thing to do mark neuter king is a great example
[50:16.280 --> 50:20.520]  he forced someone to write a law to protect black people we need to force them to write a
[50:20.520 --> 50:25.800]  law to protect average americans now that's right and expanding on this we're going to come back
[50:25.800 --> 50:30.840]  in a final segment i want to find out how mr robb is doing i've also discovered he was a daily
[50:30.840 --> 50:36.120]  listener before this happened they're persecuting so many of our listeners the answer is don't let
[50:36.120 --> 50:43.640]  them intimidate you everyone needs to step forward to say i'm brandon robb i'm spartacus if you don't
[50:43.640 --> 50:49.240]  know about that you know famous film based on true story uh composite of it uh the slave revolt in
[50:49.240 --> 50:55.720]  southern rome of gladiators uh they're looking for spartacus to kill him and he's really already dead
[50:55.720 --> 50:59.640]  but the point is everybody's here stepping forward saying i'm spartacus no i'm spartacus

[54:13.320 --> 54:20.440]  and i want to get him on for a full hour once this big media blitz has subsided to go into
[54:20.440 --> 54:25.240]  just the overall attacks across the board on our freedoms because i'm always amazed reading his
[54:25.240 --> 54:29.560]  writings and having him on as a guest yesterday just uh you know how informed he is because i'm
[54:29.560 --> 54:35.240]  immersed in this stuff and he's right there you know with me or even beyond uh in in researching
[54:35.240 --> 54:40.840]  this it's so giant i mean here's an example 10 years ago it was in the usa today that when you call
[54:40.840 --> 54:45.800]  in order a pizza with major chains they run you through a background to see if there's warrants
[54:45.800 --> 54:51.560]  and get paid upwards of 25 for your arrest conviction all the rest of it i mean that's
[54:51.560 --> 54:55.880]  why lady goes into victoria's secret and they swipe her credit card and it runs through that she's
[54:55.880 --> 55:01.080]  got a warrant for for uh uh you know driving infractions and they arrest her and taser her
[55:01.080 --> 55:07.400]  daughter at the mall no one's telling you that you're in a total surveillance state it's incredible
[55:07.960 --> 55:13.800]  and john w whitehead is helping expose it rutherford.org rutherford.org in fact i want to tell my
[55:13.800 --> 55:17.880]  crew i want to start taking their press releases and posting them at info wars.com because i was
[55:17.880 --> 55:22.920]  reading some of these last night every one of these is just a really good deep informative but
[55:22.920 --> 55:29.400]  easy to read article so we're very excited about him fighting for our liberty and our listeners
[55:29.400 --> 55:37.640]  helping burrow out burrow out um exactly what's happening exactly what's going on because this
[55:37.640 --> 55:43.560]  is a big secret war against veterans now coming out in the open um i have a national media actually
[55:43.560 --> 55:49.320]  listening right now a publication uh can you recap again just basically what the local reporter
[55:49.320 --> 55:53.720]  told you because i have a national newspaper listening right now yeah a local reporter
[55:53.720 --> 55:58.040]  in chestville can i tell you that just as well 20 people have been picked up similar to brandon
[55:58.040 --> 56:03.800]  rob they were not they were not all veterans just picked up and uh taken away like he was just
[56:03.800 --> 56:08.120]  he was saying some of them were veterans though i mean i mean specifically i said it was a i don't
[56:08.120 --> 56:12.680]  know it was a short interview he just alerted me to that fact but oh but separately you're getting
[56:12.680 --> 56:17.400]  the calls from all over that it's happening to veterans so you said the veteran both keepers
[56:17.400 --> 56:24.840]  a number of groups have called me and said and vfw of veterans saying that yeah they and we we're
[56:24.840 --> 56:31.720]  getting veterans calling us here in the office for legal help just today wow something about veterans
[56:31.720 --> 56:37.400]  but you know the department of homeland security released those extremist memos veterans were listed
[56:37.400 --> 56:42.760]  as extremists by the department of homeland security and we all know that they've studied the subject
[56:42.760 --> 56:46.840]  that's right just because they're a veteran they're bad just period it's like it's oh they're
[56:47.480 --> 56:53.480]  they're the number one threat the dhs memos that we broke because police gave them people that oppose
[56:53.480 --> 56:58.360]  abortion were listed on that so i mean anybody that opposes governmental i mean it's it's the same
[56:58.360 --> 57:04.760]  thing i open the show with oh oppositional defiant disorder anybody defies authority is considered
[57:04.760 --> 57:10.200]  psychotic essentially anybody who's a man and can't be run over they're scared the criminals
[57:10.200 --> 57:14.040]  that have hijacked this country are scared to death of the veterans period they want to use
[57:14.040 --> 57:18.360]  the troops against us with the end deposit comment on us but it's a double-edged sword they know it
[57:18.360 --> 57:24.040]  cuts both ways they saw what happened to hitler and shell chest good well thomas jeverson thomas
[57:24.040 --> 57:30.920]  pain would have been put away in civil commitment by the british that's why i think amazing in the
[57:30.920 --> 57:35.400]  minute and a half we have left will obviously get updates this sunday or sometime next week from
[57:35.400 --> 57:43.000]  you sure but any other tidbits that are important well brandon has arrived at home he's been through
[57:43.000 --> 57:48.520]  quite an ordeal we are looking into whether we know what he wants to do next i'm advising a civil
[57:48.520 --> 57:53.720]  lawsuit against the government for damages we need to hold him accountable somehow but you know
[57:53.720 --> 57:58.280]  again it's very difficult going through the federal court system because they give almost every police
[57:58.280 --> 58:03.400]  officer what's called qualified immunity in other words even though they may violate your rights
[58:03.400 --> 58:08.680]  there's nothing you can do about it virtually the supreme court has upheld that on numerous occasions
[58:08.680 --> 58:14.120]  as i say in america generally the courts are courts of order not courts of justice occasionally
[58:14.120 --> 58:19.960]  you'll find the good judge like we did in the brandon rob case who has in his support due to rule
[58:19.960 --> 58:25.880]  the other way but it's not easy i think our biggest hope is getting congress to investigate
[58:25.880 --> 58:31.240]  some commitments i'll tell you what i'll tell you what you may have to do another interview but
[58:31.240 --> 58:35.080]  if not i want to hold you five more minutes ahead of richard belzer to like have you finish up that
[58:35.080 --> 58:45.080]  point about solutions how we stop this we'll see if you can come back this is gcn the genesis
[58:45.080 --> 58:53.480]  communications radio network hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now
[58:53.480 --> 58:58.440]  storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know that in a real
[58:58.440 --> 59:03.000]  meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds
[59:03.000 --> 59:06.760]  have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[59:06.760 --> 59:11.560]  happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[59:11.560 --> 59:18.200]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[59:18.200 --> 59:22.680]  dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically
[59:22.680 --> 59:28.520]  modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit
[59:28.520 --> 59:34.280]  them today at survival seed bank dot com that's survival seed bank dot com or give them a call at
[59:34.280 --> 59:46.440]  877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter
[59:46.440 --> 59:56.600]  item this is alex jones for survival seed bank dot com waging war on corruption alex jones
[59:56.600 --> 01:00:11.640]  on the gcm radio network big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:21.320]  so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:29.960]  well homeland security has openly said that veterans are the number one enemy above al-qaeda
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:36.840]  but the pentagon publicly runs in libya and syria and of course state police and a federal
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:41.080]  marshal sent me two different documents was it four years ago now that broke that nationally
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:45.720]  we have the head and founder of the rutherford institute rutherford.org constitutional lawyer
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:49.880]  john w whitehead got about three four minutes left with him ahead of tv star movie star richard
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:54.520]  belzer joining us with his new political book dealing with government cover-ups in fact where's
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:59.480]  my copy uh-oh i took my copy home i need one out of the warehouse yeah i was actually too
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:05.080]  went and read the whole thing like i said i was going to really uh where we sold out of them
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:13.000]  oh no but more more is coming more okay okay well it's okay the point is he's coming on
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.600]  let's talk about his new book uh just in like three minutes finishing up here you were john
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:23.000]  you were getting into solutions uh and and and ways to fight back for those who just joined us
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.200]  they're now all over the country grabbing veterans the police and fbi are for no reason
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:32.840]  talk show host as well and dragging them off to mental institutions if they criticize government
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:38.120]  basically in any way this is soviet union i mean these they should all be arrested i mean it's just
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:42.600]  we've gotten so accustomed to this how do we fight back well like i said people you need to call
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:48.200]  your congressman we need a national investigation they need to get a former subcommittee we need a
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:52.520]  law for taking us against what's called civil commitment this is what happened to brenda
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:57.480]  brenda rob there's no way they the police need to do their job they shouldn't be showing up at your
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:03.240]  house without a resort without a search warrant and telling you you've committed no crime and taking
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:08.120]  you away so we need that i think americans need to get down to even their local city councils
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:13.960]  their state governments and picket we need a national movement i mean uh martin was your king
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:19.720]  changed the face of the country because he got african americans out in the streets they got defiant
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:25.640]  and what he said was this was key you have to make the government use energy so he said lay down
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:31.160]  sit down get your picket signs uh turn off the television set folks get up off your butt and
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:37.400]  do something i mean most people i know are worried about rap rap hits like latest marriage or whatever
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:41.800]  i don't even listen to any of that crap anymore and that's what they want they want you to be
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:46.600]  distracted so we're moving into an orwellian state the only way you can fight it my opinion is you
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:51.240]  going to have to get active politically and i'm not talking about voting for obama or romney i don't
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:56.120]  know to me the corporate state is here you were talking about going into a piece of place and
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:00.040]  they're giving information to the government we live in a corporate surveillance state the
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:04.840]  corporations are working with the government it's a very dangerous scenario so the only thing
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:08.120]  you can do is you've got to force your representatives to do an investigation as
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:14.120]  matter we didn't we need to know what the fbi is doing they won't tell us so it's a secret
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:17.320]  government you obviously live in a secret government when you can't find out what they're
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:21.560]  doing and they show up at your door at midnight and take you away to a mill institution well i
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:27.080]  like the fact that you made the point that there's nowhere to run we've got to fight the only we're
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:34.360]  cornered it's just like the marines when they were surrounded in um north korea 10 to 1 and and the
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:39.160]  general said good we're surrounded and now we can attack in any direction and that is actually
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:43.160]  when you're down when you're surrounded it's when you're at your strongest because now
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:48.520]  there's no playing games and and and our enemy has no moral high ground and is doing everything
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:53.640]  illegal we've got to stand up and not let them chill us i mean no doubt they're doing this now
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:57.320]  because they know this country's on the verge of bringing them to justice and they want a chilling
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:02.200]  effect listen a couple years you're going to see drones over your towns and cities over your streets
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:06.280]  they're going to be quit with scanning devices to look through the walls of your home you're
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:10.600]  having sex using the bathroom whatever you're doing there's going to be absolutely no privacy
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:16.920]  unless we slow it down privacy is dead the fourth amendment is dead that's right and
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:21.560]  we only get it back by admitting it's dead america is dead freedom is dead these people
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:26.920]  stole it but but but but but but liberty isn't like a person it can be resurrected like the

[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:20.920]  got on amazing it just covers scores of admitted cover-ups with documents and photos and murders
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:26.840]  of people and how they frame patsy's this is exciting and he got censored uh when he was
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:31.880]  basically kicked off i guess whenever he was on you know the guy with the phone hacking scandal
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:37.560]  from england that's on cnn that nobody watches the point is he was on pierce morgan's show
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:41.800]  and he's on with us now we're trying to get his video skype turned on if he can't do it
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:46.040]  it's not a big deal we'll go with his image and of course i don't know if christopher walken's
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:51.400]  going to show up and sit in his lap again you know they're comedians and a lot of the 14-year-olds
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:56.360]  on youtube had a lot of fun with that that's a very very interesting but we're gonna we're
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:02.200]  gonna talk about a lot of serious issues with richard belzer uh here today by the way you know
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:11.800]  that in the gun-free victim disarmament zone of new york um somebody in a um employment dispute
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:17.320]  shot someone and now bloomberg's having to admit it looks like the cop shot the other seven people
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:25.800]  including the shooter uh in their adrenaline fueled rush they'll probably charge the people for
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:29.560]  assaulting them you know when the cops beat you with a baton now in many cities if you raise your
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:35.400]  hand to block it or even curl up in a ball that's resisting and i think all seven people the cops
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:41.160]  shot i think all of them should be charged with assaulting the police officer's bullet because
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:47.000]  you know now i'm not joking they when a police dog attacks you and bites you if you kick it back
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  or anything that's assault on an officer even though the statutes don't say it the the juries
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.520]  don't know they're going to send you to prison you think i'm joking look it up so i think they
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:11:01.320]  should charge kind of like when cheney shot that austin lawyer and uh with a shotgun here in texas
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:06.120]  and and the man apologized to cheney even though he was behind cheney and cheney was in the wrong
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:11.400]  i think in the in the in the spirit of north korea and worshiping big government i think
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:19.800]  that uh they should all apologize they should all apologize immediately to the police for
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:24.440]  being shot and they should all be arrested and then they should be guillotined by the government
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:28.280]  without a trial i mean we're getting rid of trials anyways they should be sent to mental
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:34.120]  institutions on the moon uh of course i'm being a little sarcastic here with some satire but
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:39.160]  this is very very very very serious and dark straights that were in 19 people shot in the
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:47.000]  victim disarmament zone of chicago uh last night as well so we've got uh big reports on all of those
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.120]  fronts coming up uh here in just a moment and guys i'm gonna make an executive call here let's
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:57.160]  just put richard belzer up with audio here we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna sing the night away
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:06.920]  here and uh and just kind of run into that wall all righty ladies and gentlemen again alex jones
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:15.400]  here on the syndicated worldwide transmission and uh we are joined by again after last week's
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:21.240]  incredible visit richard belzer with david wane afterward by jesse ventura dead wrong straight
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:27.160]  facts on the country's most controversial cover-ups and i i just want to thank you for the great
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:31.480]  interview last week i didn't even introduce you properly but everybody knows who you are tv
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:37.960]  show host and uh i mean you know star of television film you name it now an author uh but to have
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:42.920]  christopher walken pop in that was amazing oh yeah well you know it's funny because you
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:48.360]  were trying to ask him about his world view and he's uh he's one of the few he's the only person
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:52.760]  i know on the planet who's off really off the grid you know people say they're off the grid
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:58.760]  he's not on a google map uh i hope that doesn't make them look for him but now he's uh he's
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:03.880]  maybe the coolest guy i know and i know a lot of cool people including you alex by the way thank you
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:09.640]  after i did your show last week my book just took off and i'm so grateful because i feel
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:15.080]  a civic responsibility on this book not just you know that it's a book but i would imagine
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:19.160]  the fact that you did a bunch of other interviews and cnn helped it as well but but we do have an
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:24.120]  audience that's hungry for this type of info and they did snap up all our copies in a matter of
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:30.200]  hours wow that's great thank you alex we got to continue this fight you know talking about
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:36.200]  what happened in new york i i love your analogy of these people should be they should be mentally
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:43.960]  uh evaluate if you're getting in the way of the bullets yes our our government is capable of of
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:50.440]  cooking up something like that i don't know if you've ever read this book uh it's called propaganda
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:56.360]  by edward bernay yes yes i did read that i made a film about it oh great i'll have to find that
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:01.400]  because exactly what you're talking about is the government's utter contempt for the people
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:07.960]  and they're so out in the open now about what the way what what their intentions are that it's
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:13.640]  really stunning because in the past all this was done behind closed doors and literally in
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:20.120]  darkened rooms with five guys and cigars that was a cliche for a reason uh but now they're just like
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:25.800]  in our face and it and uh it's pretty chilling it's like they're just taking the gloves off and
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:34.120]  and almost daring us to uh be real americans yes i mean now the choice is very very clear
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:37.640]  yeah we're spot on without warrants yeah we torture people's kids in front of them yeah
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:42.600]  we tortured people that are patsies that we're having a military trial for and even if the trial
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:47.240]  doesn't find them guilty the president can keep them in jail i mean it's just kangaroo world
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:53.400]  kangaroo court in our face why do you think the ruling class is acting like this i mean i mean
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:58.520]  will they start you know fiddling while roam burns what's coming next well that's that's a good
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:03.880]  question i think that the uh we all make a mistake myself included in thinking that
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:11.640]  there's a big grand plan i think they've already won alex i mean they've for a hundred years they
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:17.240]  they lied us into world war one they've lied us into every war world war two everyone i think
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:22.200]  can agree that was necessary i mean it's almost a cliche to say that was there's nothing that's
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:28.680]  a good war but that was a necessary reaction to us being attacked and the nazis and that we can all
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:35.320]  understand but every other war we relied to and i think the american people are finally thanks to
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:41.960]  people like you uh are finally saying you know what this has got to stop and i think that the so-called
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:47.720]  elites are really circling the wagons they've tipped their hand brzezinski did this speech a while ago
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:54.120]  saying well you know the the jig is up they know what's going on and you know the pentagon papers
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:16:00.760]  were a good start but the guys who who uh revealed the pentagon papers were also part of the war
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:06.840]  machine we forget that you know who finally got a conscience and i think today a lot of people
[01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:12.280]  in the military and in the government want to go to their graves with a clear conscience and i
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:15.960]  can't name names alex but a friend of mine has been washing recently talking to some
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:23.640]  some old school lobbyists who uh really uh want to you know as i say go to the grave with a clear
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:28.760]  conscience because they've been representing some pretty dark forces and i had dinner with a rocket
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:33.080]  scientist a pretty famous one i didn't realize what it was at the time and he was a former head
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:38.120]  of a big technology company i'll sleep at that and i mean all these guys are really waking up now and
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:41.720]  i think you've hit the nail on the head they're worried about whistleblowers that's why they're
[01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:46.280]  throwing the book you know previously the laws were clear if there's a crime if the higher ups
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:49.880]  aren't doing something about it you've got a right to go public but when they're putting
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:54.200]  bradley manning in there she was saying he leaked all this one obviously he didn't leak it all we're
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:59.080]  talking about torture of children here you have a responsibility to release that that's not national
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:05.560]  security uh now assange that the brits are threatening to raid uh the embassy he's in violating
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:11.560]  all i mean they are they are scared of their own people not going along with this that's why
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:16.760]  they're so scared of the veterans right now well yeah the demonization of the veterans is that i'm
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:23.160]  working with the va va now uh with a couple of organizations actually law and order my show we're
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:30.200]  going to do an episode about ptsd and uh how what a mountain of paperwork these kids have to go through
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:35.400]  when they come back after they're wounded how we forget about them and how we demonize them and
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:41.800]  you know the seek shooting was a good example of saying oh he's a vet and maybe as ptsd well
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:48.760]  alex ptsd is not a violent disease i i am sick of demonizing all vets when one or two out of a
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:53.960]  population like you said before what are there 330 million americans you know one guy shoots someone
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:18:00.600]  there's more than 30 million vets right now yeah and you know one commits suicide every day uh the
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:05.560]  the uh yeah so if a cop ever shoots some people which cops have done do we just say all cops have
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:10.600]  their guns taken or if a fireman does it or if an auto mechanic does it or a school teacher
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:15.880]  you know if one school teacher molests kids do do all school teachers go to jail yeah you know what
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:22.600]  i think tell me what you think about this idea alex i'm working in now uh with some gun organizations
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:28.680]  and i'm the guy who works with them who says look we can't take away everybody's gun that's crazy
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:34.040]  it's physically impossible it's against the law everyone has the right but here's my idea and tell
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:41.640]  me what you think alex i believe anyone who wants to own a weapon uh for a legitimate reason it's fine
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:46.920]  you know protect your home to hunt but you know clip capacity is certainly arguable i don't think
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:53.320]  anyone needs a 60 round clip uh but i do believe that people who buy a gun you know it's not in
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:57.480]  the constitution when you buy a car you have to register the car you have to learn how to drive
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:02.520]  the car you have to get a license and you have to insure it and that's in not in the constitution
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:09.800]  but we all do it i believe a handgun or or hunting weapon you should when you buy it you should register
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:16.120]  it you should learn how to use it and you should take out insurance and just show that you can use
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:20.440]  it i mean like a car you can do vehicular homicide it's a weapon well we're going to break when we
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:24.920]  come back i'll give you my take on this but i understand from a nice person's position you
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:28.040]  think of people not knowing how to use guns here's the problem there's always going to be
[01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:33.160]  crazies always people that don't know how to use them the system will use any bureaucracy like that
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:38.040]  like they did in new york to finally make it impossible sounds reasonable up front but then
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:43.640]  they walk you into it to where now you can't have the gun and then only the criminals have it but i
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:49.160]  do say this anybody out there buying guns they should go out and get training with it so they
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:54.120]  know how to use it and people should if they've got children locked their guns up we'll be right
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:59.000]  back but again that's a personal responsibility thing the government can't and won't ever be able
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:04.520]  to properly handle that what do you do when your propane runs out and you don't have a large amount

[01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:37.320]  Richard Belzer plays the detective John Munch on law and order special victims unit and first
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:43.560]  portrayed him on NBC's critically acclaimed drama series homicide life on the street and of course
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:48.680]  he's been all over movies TV HBO I mean I can't even have time to get into it all everybody knows
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:53.320]  Richard Belzer and I want to get into his book because we were just talking about JFK RFK
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:58.680]  Marilyn Monroe a little bit about Martin Luther King where they all had patsies folks or or or
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:03.480]  claim people died you know of an overdose when they killed him but the book gets into so many
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:09.400]  other things I mean that's why I like this kind of book is because it's just little factoids and
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:14.840]  giblets and and just data I mean it's almost like a court case or something just putting
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:18.360]  the shadow state on trial and I don't want to get off in the gun debates with people
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:23.480]  I know they're well-meaning folks we're not debating Alex no no no no but I'm saying I'm
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:28.040]  saying I respect your view I mean I respect what you're saying and I understand it there's going
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:32.680]  to be excesses and bad things with freedom but as Thomas Jefferson said we're not going to be
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:39.480]  transported to total liberty on a bed of you know feathers here there's going to be bad things on
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:44.680]  both sides I just want freedom I don't trust the government so I just say Wild Wild West go ahead
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:50.920]  yeah I know I'm here but I I think we're on the same page and you were talking about my book
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:57.400]  it was interesting the other night on CNN we started talking about the interview started off
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:04.760]  really great and then you know somebody I guess with his earpiece said ask him about the moon
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:10.760]  you know they wanted to they wanted to goad me into being defensive or saying I didn't believe
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:15.560]  we landed on the moon you know what I mean it's that's what they do to us and try to marginalize us
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:22.200]  by leaking in these you know the crazier stuff so I busted Pierce Morgan I said I'm disappointed
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:27.160]  that you asked me that question I didn't take the bait and made him back off a little bit
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:32.840]  and then he changed the subject and then you know when I tried to comment during the later
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:37.320]  segment first of all it was interesting Alex they asked me who I wanted to debate and I said I don't
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:42.040]  want to debate anyone let you know let tears interview me for 30 minutes they said no he'll
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:48.120]  interview me for 15 but we want to have you debate someone I said I'll have a discussion so they said
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:53.640]  and I knew they wanted to have someone who they consider opposite of me but I'm very unpredictable
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:58.120]  politically so I said my friend PJ O'Rourke who's the smartest one of the smartest funniest
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:03.640]  conservatives I know is an old friend and we never get shrill we disagree but we're buddies
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:11.560]  so he was on and they kind of wouldn't let me in on that part of it and a lot of people I didn't
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:17.000]  realize at the time are right you know so I was censored and when I look at it now I believe
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:23.960]  there was something going on and as you know Alex there the Cy warriors from Fort Dietrich used
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:30.120]  to go and probably still do go to CNN and rate the news you know yeah that came out in the
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:35.160]  Washington Post 12 years ago and it's still going on CNN as you mentioned the last interview
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:38.440]  people can go to YouTube and watch it they always try to pull it down the people put it right back
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:45.160]  up doing doing fake nerve gas attacks on Israel and they're at CNN center in Atlanta with fake palm
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:52.520]  trees and fake wind machines and and in between the ads the international satellite fee was able
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:59.480]  to record it I mean this is this is a joke Dan rather has done that and Koki Roberts was busted
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:05.160]  for standing in front of a green screen pretending she was somewhere else Dan rather has done that
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:11.560]  more than once and do you remember when they they were practicing a story before the event happened
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:20.680]  I believe it was rather or someone was talking about it an incident yes and it was a rehearsal
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:25.880]  so I mean who's who are they kidding it's like right it's right there well that's like that's
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:31.480]  like Lee Harvey Oswald in in some of the eastern papers what was it New Zealand and Thailand and
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:36.840]  some others about 10 minutes which is was really really creepy just like you're proud he was in
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:40.360]  New Zealand he picked up a newspaper and saw all this stuff about Oswald and went excuse me
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:47.480]  but you know we proven our book where the first authors and proud to say that prove irrevocably
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:56.200]  that Oswald was part of a fake defector program where they sent 18 or 19 people that they recruited
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:29:02.040]  from the Marines to pretend they were defecting and go to Russia you know to spy but the Russians
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:07.240]  were hip enough I think they knew every single one of them and like they let Oswald in they knew
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:13.480]  he was they gave him a job at a radio station and I mean a radio factory a cool corner apartment he
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:20.760]  marries the daughter of a KGB gets out of you know they're real easy but we prove that he was
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:26.280]  a part of the fake defector program so uh I tell what long segment coming up let's come back and

[01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:28.280]  wow we got richard belzer on the show author of dead wrong available in bookstores everywhere
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:33.400]  and i was reading that it's uh shelling out in many places sold out in our office
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:37.880]  but the book is available i guess it's going to get here monday so you know we're now at info
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:41.320]  war shop dot com we support richard the first amendment and us but that's not what this is
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:45.640]  about richard i'm not just you know you're sitting here kissing your eye and into anything but
[01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:52.520]  but i respect people who are in hollywood who come out and you know say on cnn both parties
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:57.480]  are controlled they're both driving us off the cliff we're in trouble uh you know the government
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:02.200]  killed jfk things like that uh because it does take a lot of courage i mean i know you know
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:07.080]  probably a lot more people than i do in hollywood media but most of them are quite frankly wise of
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:12.120]  what's going on they're very informed uh what you call conspiracies hotter than a pistol in
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:19.480]  os angeles and it has been for decades uh but these people have been slapped down when they go
[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:24.520]  public with controversial things and i think people like you are hitting the bar bar uh and
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:29.560]  and so that's why none of us agree with each other on everything but i just respect the guts it's
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:34.840]  like that line from full metal jacket uh private joker silly and ignorant he but he's got guts and
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:39.160]  guts is enough i'm silly on a lot of you know fronts to other people's perspectives but the
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:45.000]  point is we all agree that we've got shadowy corporate interests that can do whatever they want
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:50.200]  that are monopolistic shutting down our society and we've got to get the left right center like
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:56.760]  you said outside that paradigm together to say we got a problem exactly you know it's a polygarchy
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:01.960]  literally this country you know used to be cliche i was laughed out of the room i've been railing
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:08.200]  about this stuff since the 60s and i've been marginalized i've lost jobs i you know certain
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:15.240]  radio stations wouldn't have me on and this is in the 80s you know in the 70s uh and now it's like
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:20.760]  okay you know i asked a secret service friend of mine uh should i be worried he said no no they
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:26.120]  you know you're your celebrity they won't kill you but you know what he meant was they do kill
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:32.920]  people but they won't kill you it's like whoa it's like so i feel as i keep saying and a civic
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:38.520]  responsibility to get this stuff out because as you know from the sales from your website
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:45.320]  people want this information americans are intuitively very sharp they're isolationist
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:51.160]  they don't want to be in wars they want to have you know their privacy uh protected i mean we're on
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:55.800]  the same page we all want clean air and health care you know just quickly i live in trans part of
[01:35:55.800 --> 01:36:02.520]  the xamdara now it's one of my dogs squeaking honey that's okay bro i got four dogs that that
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:08.200]  makes me think i'm at home my wife my wife calls them mice even though one of them is a black lab
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:15.080]  she says we're infested with mice yeah so we had 10 dogs at one time that's another show but um
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:22.760]  just quickly about health care in america uh whoever whoever gives it or whoever the sources
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:28.520]  it's exorbitant it's crazy i broke a tooth here in this little village a remote village not a tourist
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:35.960]  place i went to the dentist he was fantastic he gave me a root canal temporary uh cap uh shots x-rays
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:42.600]  132 euros man in america it would be like three grand i mean anyway let's get back to my book
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:47.720]  because you mentioned that we talked about the big cases you know dr king i don't know if i mention
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:56.200]  on your show but a jury a civil jury in 1999 in tennessee found that the government was involved
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:01.720]  in the conspiracy to murder dr king oh yeah we've had the lawyer on who who proved all that i mean
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:07.400]  it's a fact that james role ray was set up yeah and it's not generally known and when i tell people
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:12.600]  that they think i'm crazy but now you know it's it's there it's out there that's why i keep saying
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:17.080]  i'm proud of this book because it's a history it's in the history section uh but you know what's
[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:21.640]  really wild is the vince foster case which we didn't talk about last time i don't think there are
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:27.880]  literally so many dramatic inconsistencies inconsistencies in the crime scene evidence
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:32.840]  you know foster death is even hard to prioritize them let me just give you a few highlights the
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:39.240]  gun found in his hand was not responsible for his wounds we have a picture in our book of him
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:46.280]  you know him on the ground with a gun in his hand there's a shot color photo he's holding a 32 black
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:52.840]  gun which is we all know this you know the drop gun that cops and killers use made of parts of other
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:58.040]  guns that was in his right hand but they said he was killed by a silver antique pistol and we have
[01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:03.320]  a photo of the weapon the gun had fingerprints on it but they weren't vince fosters the gun was the
[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:08.120]  type used by professional killers as i said not traceable pieced together from parts of different
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:14.280]  guns his gsr markings you know the gunpowder burns were defensive like he was protecting himself
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:20.760]  the poor guy um it's like they shot him in his office they came and carpet cleaned it and scrubbed
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:26.520]  it didn't tell anybody about it yeah but he had carpet fibers on him he had pardon not to be
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:33.640]  disrespectful but a giant amount of semen in his underwear which shows that he had sex right right
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:38.200]  before he was murdered and you know a lot of people when you when you die you do release a little
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:44.760]  sperm but this was really a considerable amount so there was sex involved he was not acting
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:49.800]  in a depressed or suicide away his car wasn't there when he found his body then it showed up
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:56.920]  i mean the body was clearly moved and there were blonde hairs on his clothes i mean and they covered
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:02.120]  that all up yeah the word is uh he and hillary had a little falling out and you don't do that with
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:07.960]  miss hillary i don't you know i don't want to start naming you know that that gets it to a whole other
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:13.320]  thing but uh he did have his schedule have a private meeting the next day where he was going to resign
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:20.440]  and you know similarly dr. david kelly un weapons inspector prior to the iraq war this was he said
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:23.960]  they're gonna kill me and i'll be found the woods and people saw guys in black uniforms run away
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:31.320]  from his body what about uh ron brown the treasury uh the commerce secretary well you know um i'm
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:38.040]  distracting you go back to to kelly yeah that's a great case but no kelly you're right kelly said
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:45.000]  to several people if because he knew that blare was lying about iraq as was bush uh and and that
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:51.160]  gang uh he knew blare was lying he knew all the facts he said that if we he said to several
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:55.240]  people if we go to war in iraq you'll find me dead in the woods probably and they found him
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:40:00.040]  dead in the woods his body was moved he had to you know he was caught you know when you shake
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:05.160]  someone's hand alex that's how they kill people it's one of the things in the cia manual that
[01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:10.120]  we can that we call see now where you know you reach to shake the hand but the person has a very
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:15.480]  sharp something in their hand and they cut you towards them and that's the kind of wound he had
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:21.400]  and anyway it's like you know these bodies are dropping all over the place frank olson who was
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:26.360]  head of cia special operations division it became increasingly uncomfortable with two things the
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:34.040]  use of anthrax as a weapon and on the civilians of north korea and brutal and often fatal interrogation
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:39.320]  techniques being worked on by the agency so he tried to resign he's not allowed to he was taken to a
[01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:46.760]  manhattan hotel for therapy by ca psychiatrists when crashing through the 13-story window of a room
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:51.160]  in manhattan's hotel statler it's now the hotel pennsylvania i've been there by the way it was
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:57.800]  immediately ruled suicide and the autopsy supported it this a second autopsy demanded by the family
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:02.760]  demanded by families revealed that he had been knocked unconscious by a severe blunt force trauma to
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:09.320]  the back of his head prior to the fall the blue ribbon panel also determined that the first autopsy
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:14.600]  was manipulated to do appears a suicide and that numerous points and very substantial evidence
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:22.840]  clearly indicated that olson was actually murdered now here's another chilling fact alex the two people
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:27.800]  in the fort administration this case dragged on he was murdered in the 50s his family finally got
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:33.800]  the exhumation in the 70s so ford was president and they wanted to shut this family up they wanted
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:39.640]  to pay them off so who was in charge of buying them out and silencing them and they weren't
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:45.800]  totally successful they wanted to finally giving them 750 thousand dollars dick cheney and donald
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:54.280]  rumsfeld were in charge of trying to stifle olson's family so these guys go way back these are
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:42:00.040]  you know they can't go to the hay these are war crimes these are murderers now fred hampton
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:07.320]  who was uh just an incredible civil rights organizer who was nonviolent who was educating
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:12.520]  and feeding poor people he was an alderman i mean this guy was serious he was really an
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:20.920]  unsung hero of the civil rights movement he died in a massive police attack at 445 am and uh we
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:25.560]  determined that through forensic evidence which is what i love about my partner david wane he's
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:30.760]  just micro analysis of all these events and we you know no one's been able to shoot any holes i've
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:36.840]  been doing a lot of interviews alex and a lot of them were were motivated by me being on your
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:42.200]  show and again thank you and no one can punch any holes on what we're saying which is comforting for
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:47.560]  me because i know you you get worked up because you have facts and i and i love your passion
[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:52.520]  but getting back to fred hampton hampton was completely unconscious during the entire police
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:58.520]  raid he had been drugged by an informant and the levels were so high that it was not possible
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:05.160]  that he fired back at the police as they alleged it was a lie that we testified over 200 shots were
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:11.880]  fired in a two-sided gun battle that lasted approximately 10 to 12 minutes in reality only
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:18.920]  one shot had been fired from inside the apartment near the front door not from fred hampton so his
[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:27.640]  his his girlfriend is in bed with him with their baby alex and forensic evidence verifies the eyewitness
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:33.720]  testimony that hampton's body was dragged from his bed into the hallway and still alive was then
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:40.120]  executed with two shots to the head at point blank range exactly and your book is just full of countless
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:45.320]  examples of this letting you know you cannot believe an official story by a shadow government that
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:51.160]  brings in the narcotics that runs the child kidnapping it's unlimitedly evil what's going on
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:56.920]  look at gary webb has a new book coming out pull it surprise winner i'm talking to him uh he can't
[01:43:56.920 --> 01:44:03.080]  wait to get this out proving ci drug dealing was continuing he'd had to move men would break in his
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:08.920]  house that would come sliding down the you know drain special forces style they go in his house
[01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:13.800]  have him write the suicide note and then shoot him twice in the head and then friends of his you
[01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:17.880]  weren't really friends come on say oh it's quite normal to shoot yourself twice in the head i mean
[01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:22.360]  i want it on record now and i bet you want to get it on record yeah they don't like going after
[01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:26.920]  people that are very prominent because they've been caught in that but sometimes they do i mean
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:31.400]  gary webb was pretty darn prominent and it's always the same they throw you off a building
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:36.200]  uh they they they inject you with drugs they've got heart attack medications or they shoot you
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:43.880]  in the head go ahead like danie castellero exactly you know he was really an amazing
[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:48.760]  researcher and you know they just murdered him you talk about suicide you know things being
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:55.080]  considered suicide or ruled suicide you're in texas so you know you guys in texas know a lot
[01:44:55.080 --> 01:45:01.800]  about lindon johnson before the rest of the world but in our research we found that two
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:07.400]  taxons had gotten away lindon johnson's path the white house paid with their lives and john stock
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:13.000]  well the former cia officer said lindon johnson was corrupt to the core contrary to the recent
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:18.920]  sanitized versions by historians lindon johnson was one of the most ruthless politicians in history
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:24.200]  and directly connected to these and other murders performed by mac wallis lbj's personal
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:31.080]  henchman assassin henry wallis was shot five times alex with a bolt action rifle and they still
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:38.040]  got a suicide ruling even uh jade gehoover when he was taking it off his dress or putting it on
[01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:42.040]  said uh you know he wondered how someone could shoot themselves five times with a bolt action
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:48.280]  like and kurtellic was the accountant for the financial scam being run by billy saw estes and
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:53.000]  linked to lindon johnson estes later testified that johnson personally ordered that kurtellic
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:46:00.680]  be killed using hitman mac wallis so henry marshal and kurtellic who were in in the government
[01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:06.600]  found out that billy saw estes had empty silos claiming that he was getting all these weaker
[01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:11.400]  corn or whatever subsidies you know bilking the government for millions and millions of dollars
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:17.800]  was buddy lindon johnson they were going to blow the whistle and they were murdered by this oh yeah
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:24.280]  my uh i had family down here but also in dalis that knew the people in around the the johnson's
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:32.040]  and it was just well known they would just kill people in local austin business if if if they
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:38.280]  didn't like uh just somebody competing with them they would have the hitman drop by and kill them
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:44.120]  and i actually i'm not going to get into it i just had some family that actually went to school
[01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:53.080]  previously with with one of uh lbj's a hitman um it's an amazing story but but the point is
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:47:00.120]  is that yes he was completely power mad and insane now by the end of it uh he was really bummed out
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:04.760]  i actually know some of his family i'm just gonna leave it at that and uh and and and and just a
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:10.360]  few weeks before he died the last time they saw him he came by and saw him and and basically said
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:17.480]  i've been horrible uh it's been terrible you know this has been wrong uh and so so it is true that
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:22.840]  at the end when he grew his hair out and everything i guess he he wanted all that power he was hyper
[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:29.720]  dominant but once he got all the power he realized it was nothing who are you talking about lbj yeah
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:37.400]  lbj someone said that he committed suicide and by that they meant he his doctor said if you smoke
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:43.880]  you're gonna die and he continued smoking i think he was a broken man you know lying about vietnam
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:51.640]  and having people whacked and not you know not being loved by the people i mean he resigned
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:58.040]  you know how how that is for a guy with that gigantic ego the size of the sun to have to
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:04.840]  resign i mean that that killed and i think from then on he just said he smoked and he you know
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:09.320]  he was a you know they call them the nickname as you know i'm sure landslide linden which was a
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:16.200]  joke because he won an election by 28 votes stuffing the ballot box box 13 now now expanding on this
[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:18.920]  because people are going to kill me but i'll bring it up there's a lot more in the book it
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:23.400]  isn't amazing but we'll talk about it in the final segment but people are begging me on twitter
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:29.880]  facebook everywhere it's pouring in they want to talk about how in the world you came on the show
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:34.440]  and had christopher walken then sit in your lap i know your wife's there with you and the dogs and
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:39.720]  of course mr walken's happily married it's now turned into all conspiracy theory of of why he
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:43.400]  came and sat on your lap i guess that was because that was the only chair and you guys were doing
[01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:48.600]  comedic jokes there but now it's turned into a conspiracy theory we're gay christopher and i
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:56.040]  we're gay we're totally gay no you know it's like lovers we're monogamous you know we've
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:49:02.200]  been together since uh i don't know we've been together long time we're both married but you
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:08.840]  know it's like you can you have a platonic friendship with a man you know chris and i love
[01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:14.440]  each other we're brothers you know and you know he like you said i was sitting on the edge of the
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:18.920]  couch and he just came you know if if you know when no it's a couch there's not enough room he
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:22.760]  kind of crammed him next to you so he wasn't sitting in your lap it just created that illusion
[01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:27.240]  but i mean here's the deal sometimes i'll catch myself an old friend you want to just put your
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:33.640]  arm around him and it's 100 non-sexual but nowadays everybody's so politically correct
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:38.440]  you're like oh my gosh you know i've got my arm around my body he's gonna think i'm you know i
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:43.080]  i know exactly what you're talking about yeah i'm a very tactile person all my male friends you
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:47.640]  know they know i'm gonna hug them you know and plus i you know i have a gorgeous wife who i dream
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:53.240]  about so i mean but you know some interviewers have said to me over the years i heard you're gay
[01:49:53.240 --> 01:50:00.280]  and i said yes just to be provocative i mean so what no no exactly people people made jokes and say
[01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:07.480]  you work for the Vatican or you work for israel and i go yes yes it's all true i i'm we are we
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:12.520]  work for the government and we're just you know we're false flag uh provocateurs you know the
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:19.720]  Jesuits were the greatest spies of all they would join organizations pretend they were in them and
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:26.600]  then bring them down from within the Jesuits were kind of a first kind of secret service exactly no
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:31.960]  i agree with you but in fact uh i'm not bashing Catholics here but but it is true that the Nazis
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:38.360]  at least in their organization the ss was modeled off the Jesuits they were singing christmas carols
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:43.640]  you know sees during a while but these and people it's pretty amazing let's get back into the book
[01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:47.240]  i just but i didn't even mean to get off into that little joke for 14-year-old kids that were

[01:55:56.920 --> 01:56:02.680]  actually we had a national chain a national newspaper you know the name uh call us and wants
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:08.760]  to work with us so it's it's overwhelming success the only problem is uh that now people can't read
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:12.600]  it because it is paper and it's sold out we held 4 000 backs when we come out with subscriptions
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:17.720]  we'll have some of the first issue uh but um to make a long story short i gotta go back to belzer
[01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:25.320]  you can sign up at info wars dot com four slash newsletter and we will send you out the next week
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:30.040]  and every news blast in there will be a link to a digital copy of it where you can flip the pages
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:35.000]  and click on the links and more so info wars dot com forward slash newsletter to get that but i think
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:41.400]  that says the country is hungry for the truth that's why dead wrong is running up the best seller list
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:46.440]  on amazon uh running up on the new york times we need to get this up there number one because it
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:52.120]  sends a message out dead wrong i mean people are getting more excited about about exposing tyranny
[01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:57.000]  aren't they richard we were just talking about that during the break yeah you know people want
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:02.760]  the information and because you know as jefferson said an informed citizenry is our best defense
[01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:08.280]  against tyranny and and that he meant tyranny of our own government our true patriot protects his
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:13.560]  country against his government sometimes and i think that's what we're doing there are elements
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:17.960]  within the government like you were talking about whistleblowers earlier under obama they
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:23.000]  busted more whistleblowers than any other president it's like what you know they're still rendering
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:28.600]  people uh legally you could still put a hood over an american and send them off somewhere and god knows
[01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:35.080]  what they'll do uh and that you know after this presidential election a lot of things are obfuscated
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:40.680]  because of the shrill contentiousness the election but i think after this election we can really focus
[01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:45.960]  on what the government is has been doing and what they're really doing well that's right if romney
[01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:51.240]  gets in and thinks that he's going to just business issues role he's got another thing coming people
[01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:55.960]  turned on obama very quickly they're going to turn on him and the ruling class has to know that
[01:57:55.960 --> 01:58:03.000]  their bull is not working anymore no the ruling class is running scared i think for the first time
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:09.400]  maybe on on how long um and it's because of information and i love your term info wars
[01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:14.680]  because it is a war and those control the past control the president who those who control the
[01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:21.880]  president control the future is all well said and by us revealing the true past we are controlling
[01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:29.240]  president and therefore it can affect the future that's why you know children stay there hold on
[01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:33.560]  one more second with richard belzer one of many more visits next time he wants to come back take

[02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:58.280]  we have confirmed now going on behind the scenes that in the county alone where brandon robb that
[02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:03.400]  honorably discharged marine got grabbed and they wanted to commit him and then and the psychiatrist
[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:07.880]  said i'm going to brainwash you trying to freak him out that there were other people in there
[02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:13.720]  including veterans and they're doing a national sweep grabbing even talk show host veterans
[02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:19.720]  they're very scared of younger combat veterans between say 20 and 35 or so or even older but
[02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:25.240]  that seems to who they're scooping up for nothing i mean i mean the one talk show host that the
[02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:29.320]  northeast intelligence group wrote about that we had on the show and and and they've sent us the
[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:33.880]  you know the documents and articles confirming it uh he just said man that the things collapsing
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:37.480]  this country is going to hell in a handbask and i'm going to buy some guns to protect myself
[02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:43.080]  they came and grabbed him and took his guns and put him in a mental institution until he got out
[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:47.960]  when he agreed to never have guns again i mean no judge no jury and i understand the fear of
[02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:51.800]  mentally ill people with guns you're not going to stop a real shooter folks who's mad about their
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:57.160]  hotdog stand in new york you know but but i don't want to get off into that my question is in history
[02:01:57.160 --> 02:02:00.360]  richard i know you've studied it like you said you were awake before i was awake you've been
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:05.080]  talking about this for 30 something years they always use psychiatry to go after people what's
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:09.800]  your take on this frightening new trend well it's not a new trend it's like you know the soviet union
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:13.800]  would jail someone if they politically disagreed and send them to the you know there's a great
[02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:17.880]  book called the puzzle palace well they're still doing it yeah but i mean i mean new trend and it's
[02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:24.440]  accelerating now we're doing it we've always been fascinated by mind control and people feel
[02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:31.960]  you know think that's like science fiction but our whole country is under mind control in terms of
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:37.400]  you know buying products being lied into wars and people don't like to believe that they can be
[02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:42.360]  controlled because americans are are spirited into individualists you know we're from all different
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:49.320]  parts of the earth and we got this great unbelievable country and we want our freedom we want information
[02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:53.640]  you know and we want to be protected we want to protect our families but now they're trying to
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:03:03.560]  demonize and and make people who are super sane seem crazy i mean i i you know i i don't ever want
[02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:09.800]  people to not be able to defend themselves and just to hint at someone being crazy because
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:15.320]  they want to defend themselves out of a rational fear of the state that's chilling stuff that's
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:23.400]  not to germany that's the soviet union and um you know our country now i'm sad to say by definition
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:29.640]  by muslims definition uh we are a fascist state and by that i mean it's a corporate state it's
[02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:35.480]  a country that is for the corporation not the individual and that's right individuals don't
[02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:40.680]  have rights now the corporations do which wasn't even legal till about 160 years ago in this country
[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:44.760]  in closing we gotta have you back as soon as you want to come back to take calls richard i'm
[02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:49.160]  sorry we're we're almost out of time let me just ask you one more question about walking is he
[02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:54.280]  really disconnected politically because he seems like he's so smart or is he so private he refuses
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:59.560]  to get into controversy no he really you know i talked to him a lot and i've learned over the
[02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:04.840]  years that he he has a brilliant take on things and i you know i start railing and i'll say well
[02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:09.640]  richard hasn't always been that way i mean he's wise he doesn't want to get caught up in the
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:14.040]  in the poison that's put out there so in the minutia he's kind of flying above it
[02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:20.520]  yeah he doesn't want to be on the grid he doesn't read that many you know newspapers and stuff
[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:26.760]  and uh you know i'll tell him stuff and he'll go you know you know he he's uh he's a wonderful
[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:31.880]  individual who's a gift to us well i owe you for having him on the show and i owe you for coming

[02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:23.880]  hardcore subjects not that it wasn't hardcore enough all those government cover-ups we were
[02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:29.800]  covering earlier in his book uh dead wrong i wanted to get glidden back on because he really rocked
[02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:33.000]  the house last thing was on him i don't know a month and a half ago or however long it was getting
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:37.240]  into medical tyranny and when he's saying all this stuff i mean i've done the research it's dead on
[02:11:37.240 --> 02:11:42.520]  but it's so hardcore the way he lays it out so i've got a big stack of research i want to get into
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:48.440]  here right now and there's so much medical tyranny coming down the pike uh they're announcing on all
[02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:55.400]  these big online sites certainly people sell uh you know health stuff anymore they're trying to
[02:11:55.400 --> 02:12:03.560]  restrict vitamins and mineral sales really a big deal uh is taking place you know i'm glad i actually
[02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:06.760]  brought that christopher walken thing up because that had become quite a controversy i think it's
[02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:13.640]  going to be even bigger now but we're lining up uh dr peter glidden very articulate and very informed
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:20.120]  gentlemen uh to be joining us here in just a moment i will tell you right now that uh in the whole
[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:27.240]  brandon brandon robb story is we were just talking to uh during the break a few breaks ago talking

[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:42.200]  hurricane doesn't hit him he was saying that's the hottest issue down there is that veterans all over
[02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:48.440]  are confirming they're being grabbed that's why we've got coming on the show uh tonight the nightly
[02:12:48.440 --> 02:12:54.360]  news mcbreen's doing the main news but i'm doing the interview well one of two is big nightly news
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:59.640]  tonight we're gonna have steward roads on who can confirm he's confirming for us plus we have listeners
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:04.360]  confirming and we have confirmed cases but it's big i mean we're talking about dozens of veterans
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:11.320]  per county are being grabbed uh for saying well i i mean i was talking to one of our crew uh
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:15.800]  whose dad um i was authorized to talk about this but i still really don't want to get into it
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:23.000]  works at a facility and a veteran um said he hated obama and the secret service showed up
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:28.280]  and demanded he be fired and they fired it so they don't have the power to go after you really for
[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:31.880]  your speech except for throwing you in a mental institution or they get you fired i mean i've
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:36.440]  had enough of this man and i'm starting to really get upset about this now we're gonna get into
[02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:43.720]  the history of medical tyranny with dr peter glidden bsnd he's the host of fire md now uh right here
[02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:48.680]  on the gc n radio network dr glenn received his bs degree from the university of massachusetts and
[02:13:48.680 --> 02:13:55.320]  amherst he earned a indy from uh university of seattle washington um at i guess you say
[02:13:56.440 --> 02:14:00.600]  bass tire i hope i'm pronouncing that right dr peter glenn has now spoken advocate of holistic
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:07.400]  health and currently has a private practice in illinois uh he is also a number member of the
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:11.800]  american association natural pathic physicians in illinois association natural pathic physicians
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:15.960]  he's really an expert on minerals vitamins all sorts of stuff and he gives lectures all over
[02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:20.200]  the world and he joins us now and he's also consults and works with us
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:28.280]  there on the website's info wars health dot com and info wars team dot com he joins us now
[02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:34.840]  but first doc let me bring this up here to you what is your take on psychiatry and the prozac
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:40.360]  drugs they're pushing i've been tracking the record number of 28 suicides of troops and veterans
[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:46.600]  a day uh i mean it's massive i talked to dr pacinic who was a psychiatrist last night
[02:14:46.600 --> 02:14:51.160]  and and he said you know i mean he basically agreed a lot of these psychotropic drugs are
[02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:56.600]  helping trigger this on the insert of these drugs it says it can cause psychotic breaks
[02:14:56.600 --> 02:15:01.800]  but now they're going to use uh suicides and then a few shootings by veterans to try to say all
[02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:08.280]  veterans are bad i mean next if auto mechanics do something wrong will they all um go to uh
[02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:14.520]  jail then or if dentist if a dentist robs a bank will all dentists then uh be under suspicion i mean
[02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:19.800]  this is this is pretty darn amazing you're not supposed to discriminate on race or religion but
[02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:23.720]  but it's okay to discriminate if you're a veteran you're now the number one threat homeland security
[02:15:23.720 --> 02:15:29.640]  uh says uh what's your view on psychiatry now uh grabbing people for their free speech nationwide
[02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:34.920]  well so it's the height of hypocrisy because the leading cause of death in the united states the
[02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:41.080]  leading cause of death in the united states to the tune of 780 000 people a year are treatments
[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:48.360]  delivered by mds your md is more dangerous than cancer your md is more dangerous than a serial
[02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:53.640]  killer with a gun your md is the leading cause of death in the united states and we have a funny
[02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:59.160]  saying about psychiatry in the wonderful world of holistic medicine here's the way the joke goes
[02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:05.480]  what's the difference between a psychiatrist and a psychologist well a psychologist is a person in
[02:16:05.480 --> 02:16:11.480]  a completely black room looking for a black cat and a psychiatrist is a person in a completely
[02:16:11.480 --> 02:16:19.320]  black room looking for a black cat that's not there oh man well i mean so many times it turns out
[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:23.000]  as you know big studies are all confirming this but they've known for 200 years somebody's worked
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:29.320]  around led mercury you name it their brain damage they're mad as a hatter and it's chemically induced
[02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:35.160]  schizophrenia but they don't even look or test their blood to see if it's heavy metals causing
[02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:40.440]  them to be having problems they just immediately put them on a bunch of drugs see this is the
[02:16:40.440 --> 02:16:46.040]  problem this is this brings up the perfect point because mds bless their hearts are not trained
[02:16:46.040 --> 02:16:52.440]  in medical science nobody is mds are trained in one very small piece of the pie of medical science
[02:16:52.440 --> 02:16:58.440]  and the piece of the pie that the md is trained in is referred to as reductionistic allopathic
[02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:05.080]  pharmaceutical medicine the md does not believe your body has the ability to fix itself the md
[02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:11.080]  like a communist believes that once you're sick you're screwed and the only option you have is
[02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:17.160]  to march in with a synthetic drug that overrides overpowers and controls the metabolism of your
[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:23.640]  body and you know md directed medicine is really great for trauma it's fantastic for surgery when
[02:17:23.640 --> 02:17:29.240]  it's indicated and it's you know for a handful of infectious diseases but for goodness sake
[02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:34.520]  for most of the things that most people go to the doctor for most of the time including
[02:17:34.520 --> 02:17:40.920]  depression and attention deficit disorder and and psychiatric conditions bringing your body to an
[02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:46.920]  md is a fool's errand and you're gonna suffer and then you're gonna die now let's go over those
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:52.520]  numbers uh i noticed that john rapaport at no more fake news i did a report that even on the
[02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:57.480]  food and drug administration's own website they were uh saying that hospitals and doctors are
[02:17:57.480 --> 02:18:02.840]  the number three killer in the country you know bad drug prescriptions infections all this but
[02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:08.680]  you've compiled the numbers i mean it looks like they are number one the most dangerous thing is
[02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:13.720]  a a doctor's officer a hospital i mean i've got so many friends and people that go and have a
[02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:18.440]  minor surgery and are dead in a week from an infection andy rooney i mean he was the most
[02:18:18.440 --> 02:18:22.200]  recent the most famous right andy rooney they wouldn't tell us what the minor procedure was
[02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:26.520]  but they say oh he died from the results complications of a minor you know hospital
[02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:32.040]  procedure if you want to check out the numbers there is an exhaustive 45 page report this
[02:18:32.040 --> 02:18:35.880]  draws statistics from the new england journal of medicine the journal the american medical
[02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:40.360]  association the lancet for goodness sake this is extremely these are extremely prestigious
[02:18:40.360 --> 02:18:45.320]  medical journals here's how the numbers crunch and you can download this document for free
[02:18:45.880 --> 02:18:51.320]  on my website that's fireyourmdnow.com you can download it for free it's called medicine
[02:18:51.320 --> 02:18:58.280]  death by medicine md treatment 780 000 people a year are killed by md treatments heart disease
[02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:06.520]  698 000 people a year and cancer 550 000 people a year which means your medical doctor by the
[02:19:06.520 --> 02:19:12.040]  numbers is more dangerous than cancer and more dangerous than heart disease and this is the
[02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:17.160]  billion pound gorilla in the middle of the country that nobody is talking about we are having a
[02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:22.520]  health care crisis of biblical proportions in this country it is not because of pharmaceutical
[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:28.280]  profiteering it is not because of insurance fraud it is not because of a for-profit medical industry
[02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:34.760]  it is for one reason and one reason only the treatments delivered for chronic disease by md's
[02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:41.400]  do not work they don't work and not only do they not work but they cause harm in the process
[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:47.480]  well since you were last on it's come out that merc knew its mmr shot was giving people the measles
[02:19:47.480 --> 02:19:52.440]  mumps for bella the whooping cop was giving it to them they're like this is great because then we
[02:19:52.440 --> 02:19:56.280]  get cases and people get scared and go out and get it this argument that we've got to take
[02:19:56.280 --> 02:20:01.560]  vaccines says we'll make you sick that are vaccinated hey morons you have been vaccinated
[02:20:01.560 --> 02:20:08.840]  you mean i mean again uh uh the glaxosmith climb came out that it with dozens and dozens of drugs
[02:20:08.840 --> 02:20:15.240]  they knew zero help killing people like their asthma drug i mean how many times are these
[02:20:15.240 --> 02:20:20.520]  companies have to be caught shipping tainted blood they know as hiv for 11 years bayer how many
[02:20:20.520 --> 02:20:26.040]  times garter cell killing people i mean they just keep doubling down doubling down now in california
[02:20:26.040 --> 02:20:31.160]  giving kids shots without parental consent in schools i mean this is a flaming group of murderers
[02:20:31.160 --> 02:20:37.240]  coming after us and i'm sick of it and nobody goes to jail three you know 3000 people die in the twin
[02:20:37.240 --> 02:20:43.800]  towers we go to war 780 000 people a year are killed by md treatment so we don't bat a freaking
[02:20:43.800 --> 02:20:50.120]  eyelash as a matter of fact we partition the government to give us more access to pay for
[02:20:50.120 --> 02:20:55.800]  access to this kind of health care it's nonsense it is nonsense we have gone down the rabbit hole
[02:20:55.800 --> 02:21:02.040]  of our genuflection at the altar of the md king of medicine for a hundred years now and it is
[02:21:02.040 --> 02:21:05.800]  quite a lot of people worship it why don't you think i'm gonna bow to them right now
[02:21:05.800 --> 02:21:11.160]  oh you're so good give us more factor eight filled with hiv and hepatitis oh you're so good more
[02:21:11.160 --> 02:21:15.880]  garter cell doesn't protect us from the papillomavirus but kills you oh thank you thank you for the
[02:21:15.880 --> 02:21:22.440]  flora the harvard admits fluoride in dozens of studies is brain damaging is causing bone cancer
[02:21:22.440 --> 02:21:26.360]  they do that in the 20s the soviets the nazis put it in the water that's a bullet surprise
[02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:31.720]  winning books by sure and now they admit it but they don't take it out talk about fluoride
[02:21:31.720 --> 02:21:36.120]  they're this isn't my accident the doctors are dumbed down and compartmentalized they're killing
[02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:40.200]  us we have the documents talk about the history of it let's talk about the history briefly and then
[02:21:40.200 --> 02:21:45.160]  get in uh to some of the latest stuff but i mean you break it down this explain how the rockefellers
[02:21:45.800 --> 02:21:50.920]  set all this up all right well in there in the 1800s in the early 1900s there was a relatively
[02:21:50.920 --> 02:21:55.560]  even playing field of medicine in the in the u.s nobody had the upper hand right you had the md's
[02:21:55.560 --> 02:21:59.880]  you had the chiropractors you had the osteopaths you had the nature pass you had the homey pass
[02:21:59.880 --> 02:22:06.920]  you had the herbalists nobody had the upper hand and then in 1910 the carneghi institute
[02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:12.440]  followed in turn by the rockefeller foundation funded a gentleman named abraham flexner to go
[02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:19.080]  all around the country now keep in mind this was you know at the dawn of the uh uh uh interstate
[02:22:19.080 --> 02:22:24.920]  highway system right it took flexner five years he went all around the country did it on uh train
[02:22:24.920 --> 02:22:30.920]  and stagecoach and horseback took him five years he did an inventory of all of the hospitals
[02:22:30.920 --> 02:22:35.960]  and all of the medical schools in the united states that prescribed drugs why because the
[02:22:35.960 --> 02:22:42.120]  carnegis and the rockefellers own the drug companies so he brings his list back infamously
[02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:48.840]  referred to as the flexner report gives it to the carnegis the carnegis give millions of dollars
[02:22:48.840 --> 02:22:54.680]  and this was in early 1900s on a million bucks really was a million bucks millions of dollars of
[02:22:54.680 --> 02:23:01.320]  free money to the medical schools and the hospitals which prescribed drugs now if you're starting a
[02:23:01.320 --> 02:23:06.600]  business and i'm starting a business and you get a million bucks of free money and i don't
[02:23:06.600 --> 02:23:13.000]  guess who's gonna have the more successful business you are this was the beginning of the end for
[02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:17.960]  medicine in the united states this tipped the scales the flexner report and the funneling of
[02:23:17.960 --> 02:23:24.040]  millions of dollars of money into the hands of the mds into the hospitals that prescribe drugs
[02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:29.880]  was the tipping point of medicine in the united states and since the after the flexner report
[02:23:29.880 --> 02:23:37.640]  right around 1920 the balance of power shifted and the mds started to control the medical marketplace
[02:23:37.640 --> 02:23:42.600]  and that is the only reason that the mds are in power now now bless their hearts they're really
[02:23:42.600 --> 02:23:47.000]  good for trauma they're really good for surgery but they're also the leading cause of death in the
[02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:52.520]  united states but the only system of medicine we have access to the only system of medicine that
[02:23:52.520 --> 02:23:57.880]  your insurance pays for the only system of medicine that they make tv shows about or teach you
[02:23:57.880 --> 02:24:04.120]  anything about is md directed medicine and most people think that the mds are top dog
[02:24:04.120 --> 02:24:09.880]  because their therapeutics must be better must be safer must be for scientific no the only reason
[02:24:09.880 --> 02:24:14.760]  the mds are in the driver's seat is because of financial and political coalitions built
[02:24:14.760 --> 02:24:21.000]  at the turn of the century that everybody's forgotten about and we are dying because of it
[02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:26.040]  well you're absolutely right and i want to continue going through the history but also
[02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:31.000]  want to intersperse a bit of infomercialing here because it funds our operation but that's secondary
[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:36.440]  it's because i've researched a lot of vitamins a lot of minerals and i want to address something
[02:24:36.440 --> 02:24:40.440]  here with you i'm going to spring this on you and get your take on it i mean i know my dad's
[02:24:40.440 --> 02:24:46.680]  take who actually is a doctor of dental surgery but he was telling me this when i was a kid and
[02:24:46.680 --> 02:24:51.560]  and my research shows it but the best stuff out there is young javity we have it discounted at
[02:24:51.560 --> 02:24:57.480]  info wars team dot com we've launched the new site which a little bit easier to use info wars
[02:24:57.480 --> 02:25:03.640]  health dot com it's got erin dykes losing 92 pounds on polymers beyond tangy tangerine the

[02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:46.760]  here in a few minutes but uh what makes me angry is is that i only promote what i believe in and
[02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:51.720]  i've seen people like ted entered son's dad come back from not knowing who he is to knowing who he
[02:27:51.720 --> 02:27:55.960]  is and being able to go fishing in just a few months on just a few products like the essential
[02:27:55.960 --> 02:28:02.680]  fatty acids and and the um but beyond tangy tangerine and polymers and things and the doctor
[02:28:02.680 --> 02:28:07.960]  ted's told us it makes me almost want to cry he's authorized me to say this the doctor's god though
[02:28:07.960 --> 02:28:12.200]  and uh they went and test his blood they said you have vitamin k in your blood and he said yeah
[02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:17.320]  they go no leafy vegetables well i'm taking this beyond tangy tangerine he didn't even want to see
[02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:22.760]  the bottle they just said no well i mean no wonder his dad's got his skin rotting off he's basically
[02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:28.680]  got scurvy they put him on kim and he knows never had a stroke and the doctor's god and now his dad
[02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:33.800]  doesn't know who he is now i hate to have a sales pitch on that but it's true we can save lives here
[02:28:33.800 --> 02:28:38.680]  okay this is a win win win win win sure it funds the info war you get discounts at info wars team
[02:28:38.680 --> 02:28:43.000]  dot com or info ourselves dot com but that that isn't what matters i'm watching my mother who's a
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:47.800]  triathlete get you know go back 10 years in her health and everything i mean she's going to do a
[02:28:47.800 --> 02:28:52.520]  testimonial i've been too busy my dad was like oh yeah vitamins he's like wow these are good i mean
[02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:58.520]  i mean what's going on here i mean the system has to know all this if my dad knew this from going
[02:28:58.520 --> 02:29:03.080]  taking biology at ut about trace elements and stuff needed with all the other vitamins they've
[02:29:03.080 --> 02:29:09.160]  got to know so they're covering this up so we will be sick well they they fired dr walloch in the 70s
[02:29:09.160 --> 02:29:13.640]  because he discovered the cause in the cure for cystic fibrosis he discovered that it was caused
[02:29:13.640 --> 02:29:19.000]  by a selenium deficiency in the pregnant mother and they fired him and that's why dr walloch chose
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:24.360]  on purpose to set young jevity up as a networked business because he knew right from the get go
[02:29:24.360 --> 02:29:28.920]  that the front door of medicine is guarded by big pharma so guess what we're going through the back
[02:29:28.920 --> 02:29:33.400]  door with a grassroots coalition of the informed that's why we're going to come back on the other
[02:29:33.400 --> 02:29:38.600]  side and continue with the diabolical history of this and then uh i'm going to ask the question
[02:29:38.600 --> 02:29:43.320]  why are the trace elements needed like a tiny amount of arsenic yes that's in some of the
[02:29:43.320 --> 02:29:52.440]  products what we'll explain this when we come back stay with us we're on the march the empires on

[02:33:28.200 --> 02:33:35.400]  for our guests who joins us right now the usa is 50th in the world for longevity now we used to be
[02:33:35.400 --> 02:33:40.440]  right up at the top some of the longest lived number of class action lawsuits against drug
[02:33:41.240 --> 02:33:45.400]  companies exploding all-zheimer skyrocketing there's a whole bunch of stuff we got to move
[02:33:45.400 --> 02:33:51.880]  through quickly here with dr. peter glidden and again he is the host of a monday through
[02:33:51.880 --> 02:33:58.840]  friday show right here on the gcm radio network find out more at gcmlive.com a four to five p.m
[02:33:58.840 --> 02:34:07.800]  central absolutely essential fire your md now dot com is his site again continuing here explain
[02:34:07.800 --> 02:34:12.840]  what the mighty 90 are explain because a lot of other mineral companies well most of them
[02:34:12.840 --> 02:34:17.400]  i've seen some of the really top of the line though i noticed this whole foods too they will
[02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:22.120]  have a little bit of arsenic a little bit of this and that i remember years ago researching that
[02:34:22.120 --> 02:34:27.160]  and and finding out now correct me if i'm wrong if you don't have those they don't unlock the
[02:34:27.160 --> 02:34:34.520]  vitamins and minerals working together because that stuff is naturally out there and and and so
[02:34:34.520 --> 02:34:39.560]  that's why it's in there that's why it works so well and also that the longevity vitamins and
[02:34:39.560 --> 02:34:45.560]  minerals they're not synthetic made in a factory that's the byproduct of the chemical industry
[02:34:46.200 --> 02:34:50.760]  so many of the vitamins you buy are from synthetic dead sources they can call it vitamin a they can
[02:34:50.760 --> 02:34:56.840]  call it vitamin k but it's not really so explain that to people because i mean it's it's on some of
[02:34:56.840 --> 02:35:02.760]  the uh you know tags that some of these trace elements are there in just absolutely infinitesimal
[02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:08.200]  amounts on purpose and people are like i found this i've caught you when when from my research
[02:35:08.200 --> 02:35:13.640]  that's what makes it so good is that it actually has everything explain that to us
[02:35:15.320 --> 02:35:19.320]  well you don't know what you don't know and in the when the wonderful world of biochemistry
[02:35:19.320 --> 02:35:23.560]  especially when comes to nutritional biochemistry there's only a handful of people in the whole
[02:35:23.560 --> 02:35:27.000]  country that have a clue and that have any clinical experience with this right so
[02:35:27.720 --> 02:35:31.720]  the the thing about young jevities nutritional supplements the thing about any nutritional
[02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:37.480]  supplement is the recipe right but it's just like wine all wine is made from grapes but there's a
[02:35:37.480 --> 02:35:43.080]  great deal of difference between any boonsprings green apple wine and a nice you know california
[02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:46.920]  cabernet they're all made from grapes well what's the difference well how they're made
[02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:50.280]  where the grapes came from like chicken soup what's the difference the recipe
[02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:55.080]  you know the great thing i've been doing this alex for 24 years i have been involved with
[02:35:55.080 --> 02:36:02.440]  holistic medicine for 24 years i used to work for a vitamin company that only sold to doctors you
[02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:07.800]  know high quality nutraceutical vitamins and as god is my witness since i have been using the
[02:36:07.800 --> 02:36:13.160]  young jevities supplements and following dr wallach's methods i don't even know what planet i'm on
[02:36:13.160 --> 02:36:18.920]  anymore because the results that i've seen with my patients are breathtaking and and eclipse anything
[02:36:18.920 --> 02:36:24.440]  that i had previously seen and there has to be a reason well what's the reason the reason is the
[02:36:24.440 --> 02:36:31.400]  young jevities nutritional supplements are formulated from 25 million dollars of federally
[02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:38.120]  funded research 26 000 autopsies 10 million blood chemistries and histopathologies and then
[02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:45.400]  over three decades of clinical application by licensed naturopathic physicians we are the
[02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:52.040]  ones in the world who are trained in the therapeutic application of this stuff this is our wheelhouse
[02:36:52.040 --> 02:36:57.560]  we know this stuff cold and you know when you know your stuff and you put together the right
[02:36:57.560 --> 02:37:04.760]  recipe it generates results and results is the key in the last year the young jevities company
[02:37:04.760 --> 02:37:12.200]  has increased its sales by 1100 percent in this economy why is that because it works why does it
[02:37:12.200 --> 02:37:18.280]  work because it is informed by science and clinical that's right it's traded on the stock market if
[02:37:18.280 --> 02:37:22.280]  people don't know you can go read their their corporate quarterly report just came out last
[02:37:22.280 --> 02:37:26.040]  week i was reading it a lot of that's also our show promoting it but it was already growing
[02:37:26.040 --> 02:37:31.640]  exponentially buying up hundreds of other vitamin and mineral companies that dr wallach
[02:37:31.640 --> 02:37:36.120]  you know looks at and you know knows has the formula that's why everything is there
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:41.000]  at infoworthshealth.com now now now explain what the trace elements do why some of the products
[02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:46.840]  have small amounts of things that people have been taught are poisonous well because you know
[02:37:46.840 --> 02:37:50.760]  you've they've been taught that these things are poisonous by people that have no clinical
[02:37:50.760 --> 02:37:55.240]  experience with medical nutrition and this is the problem you know we get medical doctors telling
[02:37:55.240 --> 02:37:58.760]  people about vitamins even though they have no training the other thing don't even take bottom
[02:37:58.760 --> 02:38:03.720]  okay they're saying that's poisonous yeah well there should be a law against that you know there
[02:38:03.720 --> 02:38:07.240]  should be a law but the medical doctor can say whatever the heck they want because we've been
[02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:11.240]  brainwashed for a hundred years why do you want a tiny amount of arsenic why do you want a tiny
[02:38:11.240 --> 02:38:17.640]  amount of arsenic because your body needs it because it's cardio protective arsenic actually
[02:38:17.640 --> 02:38:23.640]  helps your body to prevent the formation of leukemia it's anti cancer right you need a little bit
[02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:28.760]  of 90 essential nutrients there are 90 essential nutrients that the human body needs and you can't
[02:38:28.760 --> 02:38:33.800]  get them from food it's only a matter of time until your body runs out of something and then
[02:38:33.800 --> 02:38:38.440]  something breaks and then you go to a medical doctor and he throws a drug at it that's why
[02:38:38.440 --> 02:38:42.760]  we have a problem isn't arsenic a treatment for a whole bunch of stuff i mean isn't isn't it used
[02:38:42.760 --> 02:38:48.840]  to treat cancer it is arsenic is it used to be used to treat cancer in very progressive
[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:54.760]  hospitals before chemotherapy came about in boston it's a you need a little bit of arsenic you need
[02:38:54.760 --> 02:39:00.280]  a little bit of lead your dna is made from lead if you don't have enough lead you're not going to
[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:06.280]  have good dna you need little bits of nutrients you know across the board now listen too much of
[02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:10.680]  anything will kill you too much sunlight will kill you too much calcium will kill you too much of
[02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:17.640]  anything will kill you but it is right isn't there a compound that breaks down into cyanide in the
[02:39:17.640 --> 02:39:22.600]  pits of cherries and other fruits and and and that's a well-known cancer treatment it's been
[02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:29.160]  connected to a super advanced longevity correct yeah that's correct and see this is it all of
[02:39:29.160 --> 02:39:34.440]  this medical nutrition stuff is in the domain of information that people didn't even know they
[02:39:34.440 --> 02:39:39.880]  didn't know and there's only a handful of us in the country that have clinical and scientific
[02:39:39.880 --> 02:39:45.400]  experience with this this is cutting-edge stuff folks this is not old-fashioned medical nutrition
[02:39:45.400 --> 02:39:50.600]  this is new-fashioned medical nutrition guess what you need a little bit of arsenic you need a little
[02:39:50.600 --> 02:39:55.800]  bit of lead you need a little bit of chromium and you need the full complement of 90 essential
[02:39:55.800 --> 02:40:01.240]  nutrients but instead they give us massive amounts of fluoride that blocks all that out
[02:40:01.240 --> 02:40:06.520]  and according to even medical doctors i've had it on like dr. blalock it is actually an adjuvant
[02:40:06.520 --> 02:40:12.040]  accelerating all the other artificial chemicals they put in the water on purpose explain what
[02:40:12.040 --> 02:40:18.520]  fluoride does in the body fluoride decreases your iq they did a retrospective study uh
[02:40:18.520 --> 02:40:23.480]  20 years ago when they took two villages in india and the only difference in there were about 25
[02:40:23.480 --> 02:40:27.720]  thousand people in each village the only difference was that in one village had fluoridated water the
[02:40:27.720 --> 02:40:33.240]  other one did not after they started fluoridating the water in that one village within five years
[02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:39.080]  the iq had the iq of the people in that village had significantly reduced if you're drinking
[02:40:39.080 --> 02:40:49.240]  fluoridated water you are being dumbed down now continuing along this line um
[02:40:49.240 --> 02:40:57.880]  um where do you expect all of this to go how how bad do you expect all of this uh to get
[02:40:58.440 --> 02:41:04.200]  as as it comes out that big pharma knowingly is killing us when it comes out they're eugenicist
[02:41:04.200 --> 02:41:08.840]  when it comes out that all the ultra rich already knew about trace elements and you know they had
[02:41:08.840 --> 02:41:13.960]  my studies 50 years ago they already know about all this they're what's going to happen i mean
[02:41:13.960 --> 02:41:20.200]  will they just keep getting away with it forever or is there any type of reckoning no there's no
[02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:23.800]  type of reckoning they're going to keep getting away from it forever for goodness sake bayer
[02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:29.000]  asperd of the bayer pharmaceutical company was a member of a coalition of german pharmaceutical
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:34.680]  companies in world war two they built a pharmaceutical plant next to one of the concentration camps
[02:41:34.680 --> 02:41:39.800]  they use the inmates to experiment on they use the inmates to make the zyklon b gas that killed the
[02:41:39.800 --> 02:41:44.200]  jews and the gypsies and everybody else in the concentration camps and now one of the companies
[02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:50.920]  that did that one of the companies complicit in drug in in war crimes is selling your children aspirin
[02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:56.920]  for profit in the united states there is so much money in control in the pharmaceutical industry
[02:41:56.920 --> 02:42:02.760]  that trying to fight them head on is a fool's errand that's why young jeffrey was set up as a
[02:42:02.760 --> 02:42:08.440]  grassroots network marketing company because we're not going through the front door we can't fight
[02:42:08.440 --> 02:42:13.880]  big pharma nobody can how are we going to beat them we're going to stop using them ladies and
[02:42:13.880 --> 02:42:18.680]  gentlemen if you're suffering from a chronic health condition the best possible thing you

[02:42:50.840 --> 02:42:55.880]  bed in the morning there's no way on god's green earth we are ever going to be able to fight the
[02:42:55.880 --> 02:43:05.000]  pharmaceutical industry so what do we do just say no to drugs i agree with you and again folks you

[02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:25.320]  the solution the globalists do not want us look look alternative health is the fastest growing
[02:44:25.320 --> 02:44:31.720]  thing in this country it's panicking the globalist we've got a race and get bigger than they are and
[02:44:31.720 --> 02:44:36.760]  get strong so we can defeat them we have to have capital that means you have to have capital and
[02:44:36.760 --> 02:44:41.720]  you have to have health we we believe in defeating the enemy through prosperity they tell you that
[02:44:41.720 --> 02:44:45.640]  you're supposed to have your fight and corruption live under a bridge or you know live out in the
[02:44:45.640 --> 02:44:51.080]  wilderness or something no no we are here we are here to occupy we are here to take america back
[02:44:51.080 --> 02:44:56.200]  from the globalists that have hijacked it we are restorationist okay in the spirit of liberty the
[02:44:56.200 --> 02:45:02.040]  spirit of 1776 we're the good guys and it's so easy to be good it's so easy there's all these great
[02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:06.120]  blessings out there there's all these wonderful things out there there's all these things that
[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:10.440]  work just do the opposite of what the globalists saying you'll do great i mean i mean it's really
[02:45:10.440 --> 02:45:15.000]  pretty darn simple the globalists are for it i'm against it i mean it really comes down to that
[02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:20.200]  the final equation but go to info wars health dot com and watch the video of erin dykes because we
[02:45:20.200 --> 02:45:26.200]  have him on tv over the year is we have all the clips of him losing in fact erin's getting back
[02:45:26.200 --> 02:45:30.520]  from visiting his girlfriend in germany we met at bill berger and a half ago protesting him and
[02:45:30.520 --> 02:45:35.720]  covering it uh and and i'm gonna do one that shows all of it over a year because we just show
[02:45:35.720 --> 02:45:39.320]  you know a couple shots of losing weight we're gonna put one together where it really shows it
[02:45:39.320 --> 02:45:45.080]  almost sort of time lapse that video again is up at info wars health dot com but but enough of me
[02:45:45.080 --> 02:45:52.200]  ranting you sent me just piles of documents dr glidden of things to go over uh and we've got
[02:45:52.200 --> 02:45:57.160]  the world fact book we're not just saying we're fiftieth uh in the world behind every other
[02:45:57.160 --> 02:46:02.280]  industrialized nation we are dead last when we were one of the longest living cultures what about
[02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:07.720]  a hundred years ago the numbers were about number three behind japan and italy now we are the shortest
[02:46:07.720 --> 02:46:12.280]  lifespan despite all the darth vader technology they can't keep people alive they make you sick
[02:46:12.280 --> 02:46:16.840]  and then suck everything out of you this is such a great plan the rockefellers and carnagies came
[02:46:16.840 --> 02:46:23.160]  up with to extract everything talk about that talk about what their uh infant mortality uh is sky
[02:46:23.160 --> 02:46:29.160]  rocketing everything's going to hell in a hand basket they know what they're doing yeah they do
[02:46:29.160 --> 02:46:34.440]  they know what they're doing i you know i think it's um i think it's a plan i think it's it's it
[02:46:34.440 --> 02:46:39.560]  borders on eugenics you know there there is the game is afoot here i mean let's just take a look
[02:46:39.560 --> 02:46:45.080]  at the statistics while the md's have been controlling the medical marketplace in the
[02:46:45.080 --> 02:46:51.080]  last 100 years in the united states the rates of heart disease have remained unchanged right
[02:46:51.080 --> 02:46:58.280]  but that's in the face of 25 billion that's billion with the b 25 billion dollars of statin sale
[02:46:58.280 --> 02:47:04.280]  a statin drug sales a year 25 billion dollars of statin drugs a year and heart disease remains
[02:47:04.280 --> 02:47:09.720]  or the rates are the same well i thought heart disease was related to cholesterol well no it's not
[02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:14.040]  there's no relationship between heart high cholesterol and heart disease it does not exist
[02:47:14.040 --> 02:47:19.480]  but guess what cholesterol is related to cholesterol is related to the health of your
[02:47:19.480 --> 02:47:25.560]  central nervous system your brain cholesterol is so important to the human body your liver makes it
[02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:30.760]  75 percent of your central nervous system is made from cholesterol and guess what
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:37.560]  95 percent of the part of your brain that's affected by alzheimer's disease is made from
[02:47:37.560 --> 02:47:45.960]  cholesterol so when you drive cholesterol into the ditch with statin drugs fat-free diets and
[02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:52.920]  exercise imagine that heart disease remains unchanged but alzheimer's has skyrocketed from
[02:47:52.920 --> 02:47:59.880]  obscurity to the sixth leading cause of death from our point of view alzheimer's is a cholesterol
[02:47:59.880 --> 02:48:06.280]  deficiency which is generated by your and by the way retired top brain surgeon who did the research
[02:48:06.280 --> 02:48:12.600]  and as dr. blalock agrees with you he says it is a crime it is basically a chemical weapon that
[02:48:12.600 --> 02:48:19.160]  literally rocks your brain you're and now they've got a war against egg yolks now now they're going
[02:48:19.160 --> 02:48:25.560]  after what many doctors have described as the perfect food skewing all these numbers i had
[02:48:25.560 --> 02:48:30.440]  been fuchs on last week going over those fraudulent numbers i mean they are assaulting everything good
[02:48:32.440 --> 02:48:38.120]  it's crazy and you know autism used to be one out of 10 000 kids born autistic now it's one out of
[02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:44.920]  88 one out of 88 obesity 30 percent of the country is obese it's tripled in the pediatric
[02:48:44.920 --> 02:48:50.200]  population in the last 20 years all while the mds have been driving the bus and what do we do
[02:48:50.200 --> 02:48:55.560]  do we continue to go back to them we continue to give them our hard-earned money every month even
[02:48:55.560 --> 02:48:59.560]  when we don't see him in the form of medical insurance people act like it's a treat to take
[02:48:59.560 --> 02:49:03.720]  them their kids to the doctor every week for no reason people like like it's a treat to be put
[02:49:03.720 --> 02:49:08.600]  on all these drugs people just they just love it it's it's like worshiping them it's like it
[02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:16.280]  it is this is how bad it's gotten i mean we genuflect at this altar all the time it has been
[02:49:16.280 --> 02:49:21.640]  brainwashed into our brains that the medical doctor knows what's best for you but they don't
[02:49:21.640 --> 02:49:25.960]  they only know what they've been trained by the way let me just let me just politely correct you
[02:49:26.600 --> 02:49:31.400]  that number is about two years old you gave of the 180 something we've got web md here these
[02:49:31.400 --> 02:49:37.560]  numbers just came out a few months ago it's now uh one in 50 something with boys we'll put it back
[02:49:37.560 --> 02:49:41.320]  on screen there here in just a moment because i i almost corrected you when you said that and then
[02:49:41.320 --> 02:49:48.520]  they actually pulled it up yeah autism hits one in 88 kids on average one in uh 54 boys
[02:49:49.080 --> 02:49:55.320]  and and some numbers are are now one in 30 something boys uh and one in 50 something if you
[02:49:56.360 --> 02:50:02.120]  average them together i know south korea is even worse but the point is is that it boys don't have
[02:50:02.120 --> 02:50:07.080]  a strong a blood brain barrier i've had medical doctors on and all the stuff we're doing the gmo
[02:50:07.080 --> 02:50:12.600]  the shots all of it it's going into the brain from your research um and i know it's a cocktail what's
[02:50:12.600 --> 02:50:20.680]  what's causing the explosion of neurological disorders wheat barley rye and oats wheat barley
[02:50:20.680 --> 02:50:26.920]  rye and oats let me say that one more time whole wheat barley rye and oats oatmeal that's right
[02:50:26.920 --> 02:50:34.440]  folks oatmeal the gluten protein in these grains is almost impossible for your digestive system
[02:50:34.440 --> 02:50:39.880]  to digest and so guess what it doesn't when you get undigested gluten rumbling through your
[02:50:39.880 --> 02:50:45.960]  intestinal tract it destroys the tissue that absorbs nutrients gluten accelerates nutrient
[02:50:45.960 --> 02:50:52.360]  deficiency diseases and makes you sick and it makes toxic compounds that your kids are drunk on
[02:50:52.360 --> 02:50:56.920]  basically the brain damages them we'll be right back stay with us more key intel straight ahead

[02:55:33.240 --> 02:55:39.400]  our biggest message here right great type 2 diabetes high blood pressure obesity uh fibromyalgia
[02:55:39.400 --> 02:55:45.720]  arthritis all of these conditions have their roots in not enough nutrients now the body has the
[02:55:45.720 --> 02:55:51.480]  need for 90 essential nutrients and it is impossible to get all 90 of those nutrients just from food
[02:55:51.480 --> 02:55:56.600]  you can't do it because the lion's share of the nutrients the minerals 60 minerals your body
[02:55:56.600 --> 02:56:02.280]  needs every day like calcium and selenium those are only found in the soil animals can't make
[02:56:02.280 --> 02:56:06.760]  minerals and plants can't make minerals if the mineral isn't in the soil it's not in the plant
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:11.240]  if it's not in the plant it's not in you it's not in the cow it's not in the cow's milk whatever
[02:56:11.240 --> 02:56:17.640]  or unless you're supplementing with a good high quality nutritional supplement it is only a matter
[02:56:17.640 --> 02:56:23.320]  of time until your body runs out of the stuff that it needs and then something breaks selenium
[02:56:23.320 --> 02:56:30.920]  is a perfect example selenium supplementation was proven in 1998 and published in the journal
[02:56:30.920 --> 02:56:41.560]  of the american medical association by a guy named larry clark selenium supplementation at 200 micro
[02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:45.880]  all right we just we just lost his skype for a moment but start over your skype cut out there
[02:56:45.880 --> 02:56:53.160]  for a second doc all right breast cancer selenium supplementation reduces the occurrence of breast
[02:56:53.160 --> 02:56:59.320]  cancer by 82 it reduces the occurrence of prostate cancer but instead let's not tell the women
[02:56:59.320 --> 02:57:03.720]  instead let's just not tell them and and and not ask why is everybody getting breast cancer it's
[02:57:03.720 --> 02:57:07.880]  oh let's just try to find a cure well how about don't get it and take selenium
[02:57:09.800 --> 02:57:14.680]  and how about the cure was proven to be ineffective in an exhaustive 14-year study
[02:57:14.680 --> 02:57:20.600]  that was published five years ago in the journal of clinical oncology they did a 14-year study
[02:57:20.600 --> 02:57:25.320]  they looked at adults who had developed cancer and were treated with chemotherapy and their
[02:57:25.320 --> 02:57:32.520]  results which were published in the journal of clinical oncology 97% of the time chemotherapy
[02:57:32.520 --> 02:57:38.280]  does not work and instead kills you and instead kills you 97% of the time and instead kills you
[02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:45.800]  but now they're taking people now they're making everybody take chemotherapy it's crazy i mean
[02:57:45.800 --> 02:57:51.000]  medicine in the united states is not results driven it is profits driven and you need to
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:55.160]  understand that everybody listening needs to understand that when you're getting putting your

[03:01:45.800 --> 03:01:51.880]  you're wrong healing is easy your body knows how to fix itself your body wants to fix itself
[03:01:51.880 --> 03:01:56.920]  all you need to do to facilitate that is you need to stop eating food that's coming up the works
[03:01:56.920 --> 03:02:02.360]  and you need to fill your body's nutritional tank up every day with the healthy start oh i oh i

[03:02:07.880 --> 03:02:11.800]  i had a rocket that didn't go off fireworks for about a minute i went and picked it up and it
[03:02:11.800 --> 03:02:17.720]  shot off it blew a hole in my finger about a quarter inch deep almost down to the bone everybody

[03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:46.040]  when i was a child with injuries like this i mean what happened there dr glenn well it's because
[03:02:46.040 --> 03:02:50.600]  your body had all the raw materials that it needed to fix itself so guess what it fixed itself and
[03:02:50.600 --> 03:02:55.560]  this is our simple message right this is the fundamental thing that the md isn't trained in
[03:02:55.560 --> 03:03:00.680]  and that they just don't get your body has the ability to fix itself the only reason that you
[03:03:00.680 --> 03:03:05.320]  get sick in the first place is because you've run your body's run out of the stuff it needs to keep
[03:03:05.320 --> 03:03:09.960]  the joints healthy to keep the heart healthy to keep the liver healthy it's not genetic your chronic
[03:03:09.960 --> 03:03:15.640]  illness isn't genetic it's not a voodoo curse and it's not caused by aging your body has just run
[03:03:15.640 --> 03:03:19.880]  out of the stuff it needs you know there's things we need to do to survive on planet earth
[03:03:19.880 --> 03:03:25.400]  we got to purify water we have to build houses and protect ourselves from the elements right well
[03:03:25.400 --> 03:03:29.720]  there's we need to eliminate our waste right sewage treatment plants well there's one more
[03:03:29.720 --> 03:03:35.800]  thing we need to do we need to scour the planet find the 90 essential nutrients put them together
[03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:43.080]  in bioavailable friendly recipes and swallow them when you provide your body with all of the raw
[03:03:43.080 --> 03:03:51.400]  materials that it needs every day it is a game changer if you if you had seen one-tenth of the
[03:03:51.400 --> 03:03:57.640]  things that I've seen people recover from there would be a line outside of every longevity associates
[03:03:57.640 --> 03:04:03.240]  you know house in this country because this is the best kept secret in medicine your body wants
[03:04:03.240 --> 03:04:08.760]  to fix itself it can fix itself all it needs is the proper nutrition to do it and the best
