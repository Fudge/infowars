[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:34.320]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.320 --> 00:44.400]  it is Wednesday the 22nd day of June 2011 and we have Pastor Lindsey Williams who
[00:44.400 --> 00:51.520]  has had several insiders give him a lot of information that has come true over
[00:51.520 --> 00:55.400]  the years and he's going to be joining us because if you go back eight months
[00:55.400 --> 01:02.200]  ago late 2010 he said that oil prices would run up and that there would be
[01:02.200 --> 01:07.760]  large wars in the Middle East and that would then lead to war with China now
[01:07.760 --> 01:11.640]  his sources one of them Ken Fromm before he died the former head of Atlantic
[01:11.640 --> 01:15.800]  Richfield the other source known to yours truly but obviously it's a secret
[01:15.800 --> 01:20.480]  source we can't give you that one as Mr. Fromm's dead now so we can but the
[01:20.480 --> 01:24.400]  other source is still living so that it would go in the next six months to a
[01:24.400 --> 01:31.440]  year to 150 to $200 a barrel and it's run up quite a bit from $55 a barrel to
[01:31.440 --> 01:36.240]  a little over a hundred but not to the level that they said it would but the
[01:36.240 --> 01:40.600]  Middle East predictions have unfortunately kicked off remember he was
[01:40.600 --> 01:45.680]  breaking that down before the situation in Egypt or Tunisia even started but
[01:45.680 --> 01:49.600]  we'll we'll have Lindsay on and I promise we'll take a lot of your phone
[01:49.600 --> 01:53.440]  calls I promise I'm gonna make myself do it because I want to take your calls I

[01:57.720 --> 02:04.440]  ton of incredibly important news here in front of me on the economy on the
[02:04.440 --> 02:09.760]  military on the police state on the Pentagon takeover of the internet and
[02:09.760 --> 02:14.760]  and more and more censorship of the once free internet that that we once knew
[02:14.760 --> 02:19.680]  that is beginning to unfold we've got also some good news in the fight against
[02:19.680 --> 02:23.920]  the TSA at the federal level now two House members call for investigations of
[02:23.920 --> 02:30.220]  TSA some more more of that's coming to a head very serious military news Italy
[02:30.220 --> 02:35.960]  breaks ranks over NATO Libya mission saying it's time to end it Lewis Farrakhan
[02:35.960 --> 02:39.000]  has gone from worshipping Obama to calling him a cold-blooded murderer
[02:39.000 --> 02:42.240]  regardless what you think of Lewis Farrakhan that he's losing his real
[02:42.240 --> 02:48.200]  supporters there out of Chicago also China warns us to keep out of South China's
[02:48.200 --> 02:53.320]  sea dispute threatened his military action the Russians are starting to save a
[02:53.320 --> 02:58.400]  rattle and the Chinese the Russian cyber rattle folks they mean business so the
[02:58.400 --> 03:02.000]  world is hurtling towards a new world war you can call it World War 3 World
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.960]  War 4 Bush calls the war on terror George W. World War 3 the Pentagon calls the
[03:07.960 --> 03:12.920]  Cold War World War 3 so you call this 4 5 6 I don't know people tend to think
[03:12.920 --> 03:17.400]  again of nuclear war as World War 3 but no World War 3 just means a multi
[03:17.400 --> 03:23.040]  continent ongoing war with a bunch of countries involved with high casualties
[03:23.040 --> 03:26.840]  and if the million-dead Iraqis and the close to a hundred thousand dead
[03:26.840 --> 03:33.000]  Afghans and all the rest the carnage all over the world Pakistan Yemen the
[03:33.000 --> 03:39.640]  rioting going on the ongoing killings in Egypt Syria proxy wars with the West
[03:39.640 --> 03:46.200]  using rebels to destabilize Libya I mean if that isn't getting knee deep and
[03:46.200 --> 03:50.440]  next waist deep and then neck deep in a new world war I don't know where it is
[03:50.440 --> 03:59.120]  and of course there's big moves for a resolution in the Senate to try to block
[03:59.120 --> 04:04.440]  the house from demanding that the War Powers Act be followed and the
[04:04.440 --> 04:10.400]  Constitution be followed and a hair Obama get congressional approval for
[04:10.400 --> 04:14.200]  this new war we're now more than three months into it officially they say three
[04:14.200 --> 04:18.320]  months but for months before they were getting the rebel forces cooking in the
[04:18.320 --> 04:24.240]  east of Libya into the West and now that is all beginning to come out but
[04:24.240 --> 04:27.960]  we're on the verge of a major ground war invasion they've got all over the east
[04:27.960 --> 04:32.560]  coast the Marines doing the biggest amphibious landing drill they've done in
[04:32.560 --> 04:37.280]  decades and that just further confirms the plan to have ground invasion that
[04:37.280 --> 04:41.360]  are inside sources of confirmed at Fort Hood and other bases and you've heard
[04:41.360 --> 04:44.480]  callers calling for the military confirming as well for late September

[07:53.680 --> 08:02.800]  answer any questions you may have that's www.silverlungs.com from his central
[08:02.800 --> 08:08.680]  Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's
[08:08.680 --> 08:20.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:20.200 --> 08:27.920]  MSNBC is reporting that the FBI all over the United States last night today
[08:27.920 --> 08:35.440]  seized entire telecom server farm systems at major companies and some of
[08:35.440 --> 08:40.960]  the biggest sites in the nation are down because the FBI claimed they were
[08:40.960 --> 08:46.360]  going after one website that was supposedly violating copyright and I
[08:46.360 --> 08:51.560]  see these articles now first every month and every week now every day and the
[08:51.560 --> 08:56.680]  media says why are they so ham-fisted why why is you know I mean even
[08:56.680 --> 09:00.360]  mainstream corporate media says well why are they doing this why are they
[09:00.360 --> 09:05.400]  doing it in many cases without even court orders well why is the TSA calling
[09:05.400 --> 09:10.680]  state reps from Texas over and grabbing their genitals and crushing them and
[09:10.680 --> 09:15.240]  then saying this is to punish you because it's called tyranny they're out of
[09:15.240 --> 09:20.400]  control they want to set precedents to whatever they want whenever they want I
[09:20.400 --> 09:26.280]  mean I talk about this all the time does anyone believe that 98% of people who
[09:26.280 --> 09:31.960]  are convicted 98% of those now it was 96 a few years ago it's now 98 soon it'll
[09:31.960 --> 09:37.200]  be 100 soon it will be 100 on this trend within just I guess next year if you
[09:37.200 --> 09:43.400]  follow the graph 100% of people will be convicted if the feds charge you 100%
[09:43.400 --> 09:48.880]  of the time you are guilty does anyone believe that that 98% currently are
[09:48.880 --> 09:54.400]  guilty absolutely not and we constantly see examples at the state and federal
[09:54.400 --> 09:58.360]  level of innocent people with government knowingly putting them in
[09:58.360 --> 10:02.840]  prison putting them on death row while releasing known criminals and letting
[10:02.840 --> 10:07.600]  Wacovia and Wells Fargo launder 376 billion dollars in narcotics money
[10:07.600 --> 10:13.320]  source on that associated press Bloomberg and he got in no trouble paid a
[10:13.320 --> 10:20.320]  0.3% fine on the billions they paid a $100 million fine on it but if the feds
[10:20.320 --> 10:25.240]  come after you 98% of the time you're going to prison because they have
[10:25.240 --> 10:30.960]  publicly kept juries that are total criminals and would send Jesus Christ to
[10:30.960 --> 10:34.360]  the gas chamber if they were told to do it they would do it in a minute they
[10:34.360 --> 10:37.920]  would send a two-year-old to the electric chair they would do it because
[10:37.920 --> 10:41.920]  they're on power trips they're paid off behind the scenes they're kept juries
[10:41.920 --> 10:46.680]  this country is tyranny run by a bunch of terrorists and that's proof right
[10:46.680 --> 10:53.880]  there 98% federal conviction rate absolute proof of just no justice by
[10:53.880 --> 10:58.040]  the federal government you can still get justice in many cases at the state
[10:58.040 --> 11:01.680]  level but the feds are coming in with standardization and federalization and
[11:01.680 --> 11:09.960]  now all of that is ending and I again I talk about this a lot I get in here and
[11:09.960 --> 11:15.080]  there's all the news and a lot of times we cover most of it sometimes we don't
[11:15.080 --> 11:19.960]  cover really any of it because I'm watching the Pentagon even though they
[11:19.960 --> 11:23.600]  haven't passed the bill go ahead and officially announced they run the whole
[11:23.600 --> 11:26.600]  internet or building the alternative internet to that they've been building
[11:26.600 --> 11:31.040]  for a decade and they admit DARPA's building it and running it CBS news
[11:31.040 --> 11:36.280]  own CNET news is reporting and we've got them seizing websites everywhere for
[11:36.280 --> 11:40.480]  absolutely no reason and we've got the new regulations going in where you can't
[11:40.480 --> 11:44.120]  sell gold over the counter and new regulations going in where if you embed
[11:44.120 --> 11:48.080]  a video even if you have the right to do it five years in prison and top
[11:48.080 --> 11:52.680]  technology sites tell Congress and Congress says no we know this is about
[11:52.680 --> 11:57.480]  shutting down freedom it's about selectively enforcing and you know I
[11:57.480 --> 12:02.640]  go back to seven years ago a copy of road to tyranny as well as a Ron Paul
[12:02.640 --> 12:07.120]  speech a speech you called neocond where it was given to a state police
[12:07.120 --> 12:12.240]  officer in Lyon County Kentucky by Kelly rushing and the cop the next day pulled
[12:12.240 --> 12:15.360]  him over and arrested him and got on the cell phone and bragged to his wife I've
[12:15.360 --> 12:20.880]  got the I've got the videotape the VHS tape banded and and and it was in the
[12:20.880 --> 12:25.480]  newspaper Kelly rushing upstanding family no criminal record well known in
[12:25.480 --> 12:30.280]  the county you know for over a hundred years and and and I called the judge at
[12:30.280 --> 12:34.000]  home but I thought it was a joke even when it was in the paper I called the
[12:34.000 --> 12:37.160]  judge and the judge said no it's going to trial next week two counts of
[12:37.160 --> 12:41.160]  threatening police officer they tried to put him in jail two counts three years
[12:41.160 --> 12:46.000]  apiece six years the jury found him not guilty a federal jury though would have
[12:46.000 --> 12:49.760]  sent him to jail and they got up on the stand and said this this videotapes
[12:49.760 --> 12:56.520]  anti cop we want him in jail I mean these are some warped crazy people now
[12:56.520 --> 12:59.840]  the jury found him not guilty under these new federalized juries you'll go
[12:59.840 --> 13:03.480]  to jail for whatever they want now there's the old saying they can get a
[13:03.480 --> 13:10.080]  grand jury to indict a ham sandwich and if we don't admit just how about a
[13:10.080 --> 13:16.720]  control and just how criminal government is then we have no hope no hope
[13:16.720 --> 13:22.600]  because it's all going to seed right now it's all good it's kind of like if you
[13:22.600 --> 13:27.240]  have milk that you tasted it tastes a little bit rotten well within an hour
[13:27.240 --> 13:31.520]  or two it's going to be absolutely showered and within a day it's going to
[13:31.520 --> 13:35.240]  basically form into rotten cottage cheese you're not gonna be able to pour it
[13:35.240 --> 13:40.120]  out it's gonna be solid you know completely rotten and we basically have
[13:40.120 --> 13:44.560]  gone from the milk tasting bad and the government telling you no no you don't
[13:44.560 --> 13:49.280]  taste anything to now it's absolutely sour and clotting up and they're
[13:49.280 --> 13:53.680]  telling us no no milk is solid you're supposed to cut milk with a with a
[13:53.680 --> 13:59.120]  butter knife just just spread that rotten milk on on a piece of toast and
[13:59.120 --> 14:05.560]  it's supposed to taste like like shower grapes and those of people out there
[14:05.560 --> 14:09.640]  that tell you that milk isn't supposed to stink and taste horrible but they're
[14:09.640 --> 14:15.400]  extremist their conspiracy theorist everybody knows that milk is supposed
[14:15.400 --> 14:19.200]  to be rotten everybody knows it's supposed to stink
[14:19.200 --> 14:27.320]  all right another another parable ladies and gentlemen I I track the news at
[14:27.320 --> 14:30.440]  night I track the news in the morning I track it during the afternoon I track it
[14:30.440 --> 14:36.640]  on my globalist tracking slave device iPhone when I'm in red lights and more
[14:36.640 --> 14:40.960]  and more I understand there's two different camps of people there's
[14:40.960 --> 14:43.840]  folks that are totally buying the illusion that will do whatever they're
[14:43.840 --> 14:47.480]  told who've been conditioned to just go along to get along and there's those of
[14:47.480 --> 14:52.400]  us that are awakening that's the two groups in the general population and
[14:52.400 --> 14:56.320]  then you've got two minority groups that come out of those groups you got
[14:56.320 --> 15:00.720]  people that know the systems corrupt and evil and who like it and who are
[15:00.720 --> 15:05.880]  criminals and sociopaths and control freaks and mercenaries and psychopaths
[15:05.880 --> 15:12.960]  it's a varying group but they don't care they like it they they love it and
[15:12.960 --> 15:18.160]  you've got another minority within the group that's awakened who is active and
[15:18.160 --> 15:22.720]  openly trying to face these people down and a lot of folks call us heroes or
[15:22.720 --> 15:26.840]  patriots no no we're just common sense people that want to survive and don't
[15:26.840 --> 15:31.640]  want to be slaves and who understand that we don't have courage it would take
[15:31.640 --> 15:36.920]  blind mindless stupid courage to like not care and just lay down and let them
[15:36.920 --> 15:40.680]  devalue the dollar and let them put toll roads on all the major existing roads
[15:40.680 --> 15:44.960]  and let the social engineers come in and break up the family and literally turn
[15:44.960 --> 15:52.880]  us into conditioned biological programmed androids for lack of a better
[15:52.880 --> 16:00.800]  term I mean this is the end of humanity this is the greatest tyranny the final
[16:00.800 --> 16:05.040]  revolution as the establishment calls their scientific dictatorship an
[16:05.040 --> 16:11.480]  absolute revolution against the human species itself a global government
[16:11.480 --> 16:17.360]  designed to destroy resources shut down development as a means to render you
[16:17.360 --> 16:25.280]  absolutely prostrate servile broke leg so they can run over the top of you and
[16:25.280 --> 16:35.360]  the most painful thing about this is to realize and to come face to face with
[16:35.360 --> 16:44.080]  the fact that all of us are in this together 99.9999 percent of the seven
[16:44.080 --> 16:50.560]  billion people it's right at seven billion people now in the globe want to
[16:50.560 --> 16:54.800]  get technical the latest census actuaries six billion nine hundred and
[16:54.800 --> 17:01.480]  something million ninety nine point nine nine percent I mean you break it down
[17:01.480 --> 17:05.000]  there's only a few thousand globalists in their own words head of the Kissinger
[17:05.000 --> 17:09.000]  group Rothkopf wrote superclass four years ago you know he says there's just
[17:09.000 --> 17:14.920]  6,000 global technocrats and less than 20 families that own it all and the
[17:14.920 --> 17:18.440]  Washington Post writes a big editorial about it hailing world government how
[17:18.440 --> 17:26.960]  blessed we are they've got CNN host coming out and I've got that report we've
[17:26.960 --> 17:35.160]  got a CNN host coming out for read Zarkaya that's I pronounce it we've got
[17:35.160 --> 17:43.520]  him and we've got that video clip coming up later where he is openly saying the
[17:43.520 --> 17:49.200]  Constitution is parochial you know it's you know that means a little country
[17:49.200 --> 17:56.160]  school for elementary school students basically you know backwards bad and he

[18:01.640 --> 18:07.440]  because we have this modern system of these bloodthirsty ruthless social
[18:07.440 --> 18:14.960]  Darwinistic people who who think it's a positive thing to set up world
[18:14.960 --> 18:20.040]  government and then exterminate the general population and so it's very
[18:20.040 --> 18:25.200]  important for folks to realize that whether you're a police officer or a
[18:25.200 --> 18:32.640]  teacher or a lawyer or a bureaucrat or a farmer or an auto mechanic or a writer

[19:27.840 --> 19:31.680]  pathetic it's the opposite of enlightenment it is the opposite of
[19:31.680 --> 19:36.160]  Renaissance it is the opposite of anything good and wholesome and it's
[19:36.160 --> 19:41.840]  and they openly force feed images of death and destruction and ugliness and

[23:00.080 --> 23:03.440]  of the insiders plan for a one-world government has been initiated with the
[23:03.440 --> 23:07.440]  recent bailout international bankers and power brokers have engineered the
[23:07.440 --> 23:11.720]  current crisis to create a new currency and a new world bank to act as savior
[23:11.720 --> 23:15.440]  but we've only seen the beginning their next engineered crisis will be on a
[23:15.440 --> 23:19.800]  scale never before seen in modern times shortages and empty shelves will spread
[23:19.800 --> 23:23.040]  fear and panic across the land the insiders have discovered that they
[23:23.040 --> 23:28.000]  must control two things to cease total power phase one is a one-world currency
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.000]  which we are currently being prepared to accept phase two of their insidious plan

[24:08.120 --> 24:14.960]  okay I want to hit the big developments in Italy the huge developments on the
[24:14.960 --> 24:20.560]  economy rolling stone coming out with a headline climate of denial
[24:20.560 --> 24:25.640]  can science and truth withstand the merchants of poison you know this idea
[24:25.640 --> 24:30.280]  that you're like Holocaust deniers if you point out the sun is what mainly
[24:30.280 --> 24:33.400]  drives our climate because they the UN says it has nothing to do with our
[24:33.400 --> 24:41.120]  climate very bizarre statement obviously ridiculous but they're not really
[24:41.120 --> 24:44.320]  concerned about real environmental problems that this planet does have
[24:44.320 --> 24:50.040]  they're just busy shelling you that the new world order megabanks are going to
[24:50.040 --> 24:54.520]  track everything you do tax everything you do and control the entire carbon
[24:54.520 --> 25:01.040]  cycle but I saw this report this morning and I'm still busy researching it but
[25:01.040 --> 25:10.120]  it is on mainstream British television ITN it's in a bunch of mainstream
[25:10.120 --> 25:20.280]  newspapers it is also going on in Japan and it is 2011 folks and we have the
[25:20.280 --> 25:26.160]  headline China mirage city or hologram project blue beam video and part of
[25:26.160 --> 25:31.240]  project blue beam has been be classified that the Pentagon going back
[25:31.240 --> 25:36.200]  more than 30 years has worked on plans and this has been in popular mechanics
[25:36.200 --> 25:42.880]  for their publications to project 2,000-foot Buddhas or Jesus or Mohammed
[25:42.880 --> 25:49.200]  as a military tool to confuse people also they can project generally though
[25:49.200 --> 25:52.880]  they've got to have fog it happens in foggy weather a 12 a lot of times in
[25:52.880 --> 25:58.200]  Mexico City the flying saucers are seen by hundreds of thousands that look so
[25:58.200 --> 26:01.520]  real but it's always when there's low-lying fog because then they can
[26:01.520 --> 26:07.000]  project the giant holograms better and the same thing has now happened in
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.240]  China we're going to cover this more in the third hour today after Lindsey
[26:10.240 --> 26:20.400]  Williams leaves us complete total cities with cars driving full lights out over
[26:20.400 --> 26:25.120]  the rivers and it's just in front of everyone in the government doesn't say
[26:25.120 --> 26:30.160]  what it is I mean complete buildings trees in fact we're showing it on screen
[26:30.160 --> 26:35.920]  right now that does not exist and I've seen the reports that will dig some of
[26:35.920 --> 26:40.680]  those up in Japan for years now they have giant sold-out crowds with huge 30
[26:40.680 --> 26:46.760]  foot holograms of computerized performers that don't exist and I've
[26:46.760 --> 26:50.400]  talked to Hollywood folks that have been given the private tour of James Cameron's
[26:50.400 --> 26:57.240]  facilities he's also working with George Lucas in the future you're gonna have
[26:57.240 --> 27:02.880]  ample of theaters where where you go to the movies and you put on glasses with
[27:02.880 --> 27:07.400]  one system but not glasses with the other and that there are full films shot
[27:07.400 --> 27:14.360]  of holograms and full movies in hologram and they're kind of rolling out now with
[27:14.360 --> 27:19.560]  most movies now and before it was rare to have a 3d movie now most movies are
[27:19.560 --> 27:23.360]  coming out with a 3d version well they're just basically phasing in but
[27:23.360 --> 27:27.640]  Japan South Korea have already gone there China's already gone there and and you
[27:27.640 --> 27:32.280]  go watch a performance a play with 30-foot holograms well it's the same
[27:32.280 --> 27:35.080]  thing they're gonna build these giant amplitheaters all over the United States
[27:35.080 --> 27:39.080]  you're gonna go and watch giant hologram movies so you'll go see something
[27:39.080 --> 27:46.520]  like you know Star Wars episode 7 not the prequels not the originals but you
[27:46.520 --> 27:51.200]  know after a revenge of the Jedi this is all being planned and developed and you
[27:51.200 --> 27:56.680]  will see the entire characters 10 20 30 feet tall depending on what the scale
[27:56.680 --> 28:00.680]  is at the theater and you're gonna watch a giant full-color battle and you're
[28:00.680 --> 28:04.520]  not gonna have to wear glasses to do it but but the point is we're not in
[28:04.520 --> 28:09.800]  Kansas anymore this is Buck Rogersville and most of the technology out there has
[28:09.800 --> 28:13.760]  been suppressed we're conservatively most government scientists have admitted
[28:13.760 --> 28:18.560]  and it's been leaked about 30 years behind they had the b2 bomber for more
[28:18.560 --> 28:23.780]  than 25 years before they rolled it out in the or they'd roll it out in like
[28:23.780 --> 28:31.400]  1989 it's like that stealth helicopter that blew up but on the supposed been
[28:31.400 --> 28:35.720]  Laden raid you know look like something out of well look like something out of
[28:35.720 --> 28:41.240]  2012 didn't it well we're not 1975 anymore folks and so that's that's that's
[28:41.240 --> 28:44.560]  why the government's so arrogant it's why they're on such power trips they
[28:44.560 --> 28:50.560]  admit that they've got human version mouse pox and this is in the news that
[28:50.560 --> 28:55.000]  will kill 99% of those exposed if you just type in a bowl of vaccine you'll
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.320]  see facilities in Austin and all over the country quote trying to splice it
[28:59.320 --> 29:03.580]  with the human cold to make it airborne but then they say it's for vaccine
[29:03.580 --> 29:08.160]  research but it's come out that these programs are not for vaccine research in
[29:08.160 --> 29:16.240]  bio shield that that's the public cover it is bio weapons well ladies and gentlemen
[29:16.240 --> 29:20.080]  you know yesterday I just kind of flippantly said thousands of astronauts
[29:20.080 --> 29:24.200]  have died in the secret space program I don't know how many have died insiders
[29:24.200 --> 29:28.240]  at NASA and a lot of you in mainline reports about dead Russians on the moon
[29:28.240 --> 29:32.280]  stuff like that Chinese reportedly had a failed mission the point is you got the
[29:32.280 --> 29:36.600]  public version of everything okay the space shuttle that they're just now
[29:36.600 --> 29:45.480]  retiring is a 1934 design by Werner von Braun and that's on record so the
[29:45.480 --> 29:51.360]  shuttle's 1930s there's a lot more advanced stuff up there we're on the
[29:51.360 --> 30:00.720]  March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this is
[30:00.720 --> 30:04.080]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[30:04.080 --> 30:08.040]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[30:08.040 --> 30:12.280]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[30:12.280 --> 30:16.560]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[30:16.560 --> 30:20.920]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[30:20.920 --> 30:25.040]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[30:25.040 --> 30:29.520]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[30:29.520 --> 30:33.680]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[30:33.680 --> 30:37.640]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[30:37.640 --> 30:41.480]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[30:41.480 --> 30:44.200]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[33:19.200 --> 33:22.920]  all right I'm going to open the phones up here in just a few minutes for the
[33:22.920 --> 33:28.680]  rest of the hour ahead of Lindsay Williams joining us to break down the
[33:28.680 --> 33:32.640]  latest that his former oil company executive has told him about the
[33:32.640 --> 33:36.640]  globalist plans most of what his sources have told him have come true but
[33:36.640 --> 33:40.000]  he's only got a few more months for their prediction made eight months ago to
[33:40.000 --> 33:45.200]  come true that oil would go to $150 a barrel or above now previously they did
[33:45.200 --> 33:49.320]  predict that happening in 08 six months before it happened when oil was 40
[33:49.320 --> 33:53.680]  something dollars a barrel that it would go up to 150 did exactly that then his
[33:53.680 --> 33:57.200]  sources predicted it would go below 40 everybody laughed at Williams again it
[33:57.200 --> 34:02.600]  did that so he's been overall very accurate with his sources by the way
[34:02.600 --> 34:07.560]  both sources known to yours truly and now the public of course knows Ken from
[34:07.560 --> 34:11.800]  the former head of Atlantic richfield because he died last December we can
[34:11.800 --> 34:17.200]  now reveal that source but we can't reveal the other source but he said back
[34:17.200 --> 34:21.600]  in October big giant conflict and destabilization and wars in the Middle
[34:21.600 --> 34:26.800]  East but that would then lead to China watch China it's the big one but that
[34:26.800 --> 34:31.560]  was put out into 2012 and now we've got the news today China warns us to keep out
[34:31.560 --> 34:36.640]  of South China Sea dispute associated press Italy breaks ranks over NATO
[34:36.640 --> 34:40.560]  Libya mission we're gonna be breaking that down with Lindsey Williams coming
[34:40.560 --> 34:46.960]  up in the next hour and we'll open the phones up of course for Lindsey but the
[34:46.960 --> 34:53.960]  toll-free number to join us now is 800-259-9231 now ITN is big
[34:53.960 --> 34:58.720]  international mainline television but they've now put out a little a correction
[34:58.720 --> 35:06.320]  that they mistranslated the the Chinese reports because the headlines
[35:06.320 --> 35:11.280]  hologram experiment in China and it's the fog so bad that you see buildings
[35:11.280 --> 35:14.960]  sticking up and things and people saying looks like a hologram but it isn't
[35:14.960 --> 35:19.520]  but the point is is that they have done hologram test in China they have done
[35:19.520 --> 35:23.560]  hologram test here those are partially declassified they've done them in Japan
[35:23.560 --> 35:29.280]  and it's admitted that they the Hollywood wants to move to to full
[35:29.280 --> 35:33.840]  hologram productions that that they've had the technology for a long time
[35:33.840 --> 35:38.160]  there's just a great expense in putting it in but the big places this has been
[35:38.160 --> 35:48.200]  accepted are South Korea and Japan and I actually we have a clip here of a
[35:48.200 --> 35:54.560]  packed arena in Japan will we'll get this linked up on info wars dot com or
[35:54.560 --> 36:00.840]  present on it dot com in this article China mirage city hologram or project
[36:00.840 --> 36:05.160]  blue beam I'm gonna get an update on that and have this video that jaren found
[36:05.160 --> 36:10.240]  posted there if it will turn the audio up for radio listeners but but I mean
[36:10.240 --> 36:14.360]  watching this video you cannot even tell that those are holograms you know they
[36:14.360 --> 36:19.560]  are three-dimensional you can see them from all sides because in a moment they
[36:19.560 --> 36:27.560]  cut the side shots and this is from Japan where this is going on and so
[36:27.560 --> 36:33.080]  that's the future of film and media or at least the future there they're they're
[36:33.080 --> 36:38.920]  trying to push us into and the big boys want this because the expense of the
[36:38.920 --> 36:43.880]  systems will will will put this out of reach of the general public and so
[36:43.880 --> 36:47.520]  still you'll have to you know have big corporations that are able to fund all
[36:47.520 --> 36:52.680]  of this and then charge high prices for people to be able to get this media but
[36:52.680 --> 36:56.000]  still they've had 3d television for years the problem is so many people get
[36:56.000 --> 37:00.840]  nauseous from it because it's a different type of technology than the old-fashioned
[37:00.840 --> 37:06.800]  stuff that they're using in the theaters but I've I've a now now digressed with
[37:06.800 --> 37:13.040]  that report but here is some of the other news I've got simply because it ties
[37:13.040 --> 37:18.320]  into the overall globalist austerity strategy and the foreign banking takeover
[37:18.320 --> 37:22.640]  of our country and it ties into Rick Perry city may look at bite-sized fixes
[37:22.640 --> 37:28.920]  for I-35 three separate rounds in Texas they tried to hand over 8,000 miles of
[37:28.920 --> 37:35.360]  Texas roads to a foreign companies based in Australia and Spain and it turned
[37:35.360 --> 37:40.080]  out there were insider deals that the roads were already paid for that the
[37:40.080 --> 37:45.040]  Texas budget actually has plenty of money for roads because of the gas taxes
[37:45.040 --> 37:49.480]  and other taxes but they sell this hoax that there's not enough money when
[37:49.480 --> 37:53.960]  really it's just handing over the infrastructure in the case of Texas
[37:53.960 --> 37:57.960]  we're not even bankrupt like many other states it's just it's just the they're
[37:57.960 --> 38:02.320]  trying to hand it over and under federal and state law it's illegal to put toll
[38:02.320 --> 38:07.560]  roads on existing roads so what they do is they restripe the lanes and claim that
[38:07.560 --> 38:13.880]  that's a new road and then put toll roads in and I-35 is the busiest stretch
[38:13.880 --> 38:20.000]  of road in the United States from Dallas to San Antonio and the busiest area on
[38:20.000 --> 38:27.120]  that area that sector is Austin Texas it basically from about 430 until 630 at
[38:27.120 --> 38:31.920]  night is a parking lot and they built all these new taxpayer roads that are
[38:31.920 --> 38:35.360]  toll roads that you drive down almost no one's using them because on top of the
[38:35.360 --> 38:39.920]  gas prices they can't afford it they're already paying for the road and now
[38:39.920 --> 38:45.120]  they're going to take part of I-35 shut down the entrance ramps and exit ramps
[38:45.120 --> 38:49.040]  most of them and I heard local radio today promoting it as if it would fix
[38:49.040 --> 38:52.240]  our problems this has been done in other parts of the country they're gonna take
[38:52.240 --> 38:56.960]  the three-lane road that's the busiest in the country that they never expand and
[38:56.960 --> 39:01.960]  they're going to restripe it and take one of the lanes at least or perhaps two
[39:01.960 --> 39:07.080]  and turn it into bus lanes well we're already set up as a sprawling system
[39:07.080 --> 39:12.200]  people already live in the suburbs folks can't get to the bus with their car
[39:12.200 --> 39:18.600]  from a bus to then ride a bus on this new lane but don't worry you can still
[39:18.600 --> 39:22.920]  drive your car it's just going to be an expensive toll road and it's just pure
[39:22.920 --> 39:27.600]  profit-tearing pure mafia takeover and when they announced two years ago napped
[39:27.600 --> 39:32.200]  a superhighway Texas trans-texas corridor dead when they announced that it
[39:32.200 --> 39:37.760]  was dead in Texas in the in the AP article at the bottom it said well
[39:37.760 --> 39:41.160]  they're just now going to do a piecemeal and not call the trans-texas
[39:41.160 --> 39:45.080]  corridor now now now first going back five years ago we play these clips here
[39:45.080 --> 39:53.040]  CNN and MSNBC actually got up and said things like Ron Paul is insane he is
[39:53.040 --> 39:58.400]  imagining an imaginary trans-texas corridor billboards were up Texans all
[39:58.400 --> 40:04.520]  saw this it didn't make sense the toll roads were going in and I played the
[40:04.520 --> 40:09.160]  clips here where they were talking to the other 49 states and they said there's
[40:09.160 --> 40:13.200]  no napped a superhighway there's no trans-texas corridor none of there's no
[40:13.200 --> 40:17.680]  toll roads coming that's a military tactic as they march on your
[40:17.680 --> 40:21.360]  emplacements firing at you they'll have bullhorns going saying we're not
[40:21.360 --> 40:25.280]  assaulting come out with your hands up and in many wars it's been shown people
[40:25.280 --> 40:28.560]  will come out and actually be shot because they're panicking as the advancing
[40:28.560 --> 40:31.840]  army comes they want to believe they've got a way out so they'll go ahead and
[40:31.840 --> 40:36.640]  just stand up they'll go ahead and stand up and be shot they'll run towards the
[40:36.640 --> 40:42.080]  machine guns ah yes same thing at Waco you know they were sitting there
[40:42.080 --> 40:44.880]  shooting the dividends as they came out from behind the tanks on the flare
[40:44.880 --> 40:48.720]  footage they were saying not an assault come out we are your friends come out
[40:48.720 --> 40:53.600]  with your hands up and they would come out and be shot so it's and then the
[40:53.600 --> 40:56.800]  flare footage got released showing the troops behind the tanks you know black
[40:56.800 --> 41:01.440]  and white footage from the FLIR from the FBI zone plane and they're shooting and
[41:01.440 --> 41:05.520]  you see the people falling and they said that those little Christmas tree things
[41:05.520 --> 41:10.800]  off the end of guns those are flashes from debris on the ground you see guys
[41:10.800 --> 41:15.440]  piling out of the backs of the tanks in classic infantry maneuver you see them
[41:15.440 --> 41:21.120]  aiming you see them shooting and it's like oh no that's a mirage on the video
[41:21.120 --> 41:26.320]  tape so the point is is that more and more reality is is is just
[41:26.320 --> 41:31.040]  bleeding into fantasy as they as they force feed all of this
[41:31.040 --> 41:35.120]  and it says thinking big notice how this Ben Weir wrote this piece
[41:35.120 --> 41:38.400]  propaganda just to make the whole thing sound great
[41:38.400 --> 41:42.960]  oh it's bite size it's little don't worry about it think big
[41:42.960 --> 41:46.000]  thinking big about it hit 35 over the past two decades
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.720]  has mostly led to canceled studies and ignored proposals rather than action
[41:50.720 --> 41:54.560]  oh see and they always say you wouldn't let us turn into toll roads
[41:54.560 --> 41:58.560]  so that's why it's so screwed up
[41:58.640 --> 42:02.160]  and they say oh because of electric cars there's not enough money in the gas
[42:02.160 --> 42:06.320]  tax when actually gas tax revenues in every state are off the chart
[42:06.320 --> 42:10.320]  same thing federal every year we use millions of barrels more
[42:10.320 --> 42:14.320]  but they don't care they don't care they don't care that most states have put
[42:14.320 --> 42:17.200]  you money in their highway fund they tell you there's not enough money we got to
[42:17.200 --> 42:20.240]  put toll roads on it by the way a foreign company is going to
[42:20.240 --> 42:24.480]  restripe the road and so they get to happen for 25 years now
[42:24.480 --> 42:27.040]  but you're still also going to pay for the upkeep but they just get all the
[42:27.040 --> 42:32.880]  money how how's that sound the awesome city council
[42:32.880 --> 42:36.400]  on thursday will consider paying parson's
[42:36.400 --> 42:40.800]  rickenhoff america ink up to one million to produce a list of short-term
[42:40.800 --> 42:44.240]  mid-term and long-term recommendations for improving traffic flow
[42:44.240 --> 42:48.880]  on awesome notoriously congested highway and they go on with the proposals that
[42:48.880 --> 42:52.800]  are already out to shut down the entrance and exit ramps
[42:52.800 --> 42:56.800]  they do this all over the country so you can't even get off in the city and
[42:56.800 --> 43:00.320]  then it's a total snarl at the few places they let you get off
[43:00.320 --> 43:04.960]  and to turn it into a bus lane and toll road lane
[43:04.960 --> 43:13.280]  and it just goes on uh from there okay i said i'd go to your calls and i
[43:13.840 --> 43:18.480]  here's some of the military news i'm going to break down with um
[43:18.480 --> 43:21.760]  our guest onesy williams when he comes on because it ties into all this
[43:21.760 --> 43:26.160]  idly breaks ranks over nato libya mission says that they want to cease
[43:26.160 --> 43:30.960]  fire and end of hostilities uh here's another one kerry mccain
[43:30.960 --> 43:35.280]  introduced resolution to legitimize invasion of libya we told you that
[43:35.280 --> 43:39.360]  ground war is on uh biggest marine corps amphibious landing
[43:39.360 --> 43:43.440]  drill to take place on the east coast and multi states coming up
[43:43.440 --> 43:47.840]  when we're breaking that down no troop withdrawal uh in afghanistan
[43:47.840 --> 43:51.920]  it's all smoke and mirrors by obama claiming they're about to have a troop
[43:51.920 --> 43:55.440]  withdrawal they're just going to pull out some and then put in more
[43:55.440 --> 43:59.120]  scores of u.s airstrikes in libya in the last few days
[43:59.120 --> 44:02.480]  we're going to be going over that also turkish actions designed to trigger
[44:02.480 --> 44:06.800]  nato confrontation with syria
[44:08.720 --> 44:12.000]  another report here the destabilization of syria and the broader
[44:12.000 --> 44:17.840]  middle east war that is all coming up but right now uh let's go to your phone
[44:17.840 --> 44:22.080]  calls let's talk to ben in tennessee ben thanks for holding
[44:22.080 --> 44:28.080]  hey elixir kudos um got a couple of things uh one question for hendy
[44:28.080 --> 44:31.600]  williams one thing i saw on drudge this morning i'm sure you probably saw
[44:31.600 --> 44:35.680]  seeing it as well um where the fbi is now shutting down
[44:35.680 --> 44:38.880]  websites and they're just doing it right out in the open
[44:38.880 --> 44:42.720]  um it's you know that they've been doing this now for a while
[44:42.720 --> 44:46.080]  well they're not just shutting down websites they will shut down entire
[44:46.080 --> 44:50.960]  telecommunications data centers with some of the biggest sites in the country
[44:50.960 --> 44:54.640]  uh and and and and then they will prosecute
[44:54.640 --> 44:58.640]  data centers if one of a thousand you know thousand plus customers
[44:58.640 --> 45:03.120]  does something wrong they claim and and no this is the hacking up of the
[45:03.120 --> 45:06.160]  internet as we know it right as cyber security
[45:06.160 --> 45:09.760]  openly rolls out with the pentagon in charge of it
[45:09.760 --> 45:12.880]  right and then the other thing i wanted to let you know this is kind of some
[45:12.880 --> 45:17.040]  inside intel because my dad's in the banking industry and um
[45:17.040 --> 45:21.600]  they're basically bringing austerity measures uh into
[45:21.600 --> 45:25.360]  some of these uh he works for one of the largest domestic banks
[45:25.360 --> 45:29.280]  here in america and um they're basically in the next
[45:29.280 --> 45:33.040]  one 12 to 24 months are going to be bringing in austerity measures on the
[45:33.040 --> 45:36.320]  workers in the banks by flashing their benefits
[45:36.320 --> 45:40.880]  flashing their uh hourly work weeks things of that nature
[45:40.880 --> 45:44.560]  there's a wallpaper that he got yesterday that's just really astonishing
[45:44.560 --> 45:48.160]  what they're going to be doing but my question for lindsay williams later
[45:48.160 --> 45:53.360]  is um i just wanted to get his take on how um king of dola in saudi arabia i
[45:53.360 --> 45:58.880]  think he doled out what 137 billion to the uh public to keep him from riding
[45:58.880 --> 46:02.320]  and things of that nature and i wanted to see what
[46:02.320 --> 46:06.480]  lindsay's take on you know what you know what what the next
[46:06.480 --> 46:10.400]  dominos basically they're gonna be sure well lindsay sources were accurate
[46:10.400 --> 46:14.160]  and saying and this is before all this started that they would try to overthrow
[46:14.160 --> 46:17.520]  uh saudi arabia and that saudi arabia was also on the target list and we've
[46:17.520 --> 46:20.880]  now seen that and we've seen saudi arabia run to china
[46:20.880 --> 46:27.440]  and run to uh russia and we also speaking of the internet we see
[46:27.440 --> 46:30.800]  the big announcements oh darpa's built a new internet
[46:30.800 --> 46:35.040]  to test cyber attacks on and also so activists
[46:35.040 --> 46:39.360]  worldwide can't be shut down by their governments well well really that's a
[46:39.360 --> 46:42.800]  two-way street it's so they can shut down our internet or other
[46:42.800 --> 46:47.680]  internets because globally you know they've got uh back doors you know into
[46:47.680 --> 46:51.600]  all these major computer systems where they can shut everything off but the
[46:51.600 --> 46:54.480]  system the establishment still has their internet
[46:54.480 --> 46:58.160]  communication see they get it's all dependent on this on this
[46:58.160 --> 47:02.400]  technological grid and then they can either curtail it gate keep it or
[47:02.400 --> 47:06.240]  totally shut it off if they want and shut down global commerce anytime they
[47:06.240 --> 47:09.920]  want it's a kill switch and a tracking system built into the
[47:09.920 --> 47:13.520]  very fabric of the internet i mean this is a total full spectrum
[47:13.520 --> 47:16.400]  dominance uh takeover so i will bring that up
[47:16.400 --> 47:20.800]  uh to lindsay williams uh let's talk to uh chris in kentucky chris thanks for
[47:20.800 --> 47:24.080]  holding hey alex hey buddy
[47:24.080 --> 47:28.160]  hey i tell you what i got some news here uh since we had that stage al-qaeda
[47:28.160 --> 47:32.000]  situation here in bowling green i'd live at loyal actually but the uh heard on
[47:32.000 --> 47:35.680]  that radio that now this kentucky state police wants to do safety checks on
[47:35.680 --> 47:38.960]  trucks oh no there goes a fourth amendment i'm
[47:38.960 --> 47:42.480]  getting so fed up with this this is so disgusting this is a
[47:42.480 --> 47:46.400]  to try to end our free right to travel well as if they're gonna stop terrorist
[47:46.400 --> 47:50.240]  if the terrorist even existed weren't provocateur nine times out of ten
[47:50.240 --> 47:55.920]  as if it would even protect us uh somehow i mean
[47:55.920 --> 48:00.160]  if they attack malls then do we put body scanners in malls yes they're saying do
[48:00.160 --> 48:03.520]  that preemptively then will they attack the the parking lot
[48:03.520 --> 48:07.040]  do we put a checkpoint in the parking lot then we put one on the highway
[48:07.040 --> 48:11.440]  you can't stop somebody who wants to go out and do violence
[48:11.440 --> 48:14.880]  uh preemptively all you can do is have an armed population
[48:14.880 --> 48:19.600]  to respond to the tower shooter or somebody going into a school or whatever
[48:19.600 --> 48:23.200]  the case is right an armed society is the way to
[48:23.200 --> 48:26.400]  do it but it's just all this mass conditioning i mean there's the people
[48:26.400 --> 48:29.440]  are so that's because they're getting ready for a new
[48:29.440 --> 48:33.200]  giant world war they'll claim that the foreign terrorists have shut down the
[48:33.200 --> 48:36.960]  web to shut down our communications this is all being done to blow off the
[48:36.960 --> 48:40.000]  economy and consolidate it and on the ashes of it
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.720]  announce the world government which they've already started to announce
[48:42.720 --> 48:47.600]  that you pay your carbon taxes too it is total global domination
[48:47.600 --> 48:51.280]  against every sovereign nation but more importantly against the family
[48:51.280 --> 48:54.880]  and the individual it is a scientific assault
[48:54.880 --> 49:00.320]  on humanity i appreciate your call and and that's in the establishment's own

[55:05.840 --> 55:09.920]  is being butchered demolition in front of us every day
[55:09.920 --> 55:14.320]  and with it total tyranny is coming in depression
[55:14.320 --> 55:18.720]  government lies about unemployment and inflation
[55:18.720 --> 55:23.440]  I mean we've seen this throughout history and now it's happening again
[55:23.440 --> 55:27.840]  by finishing up you're 17,600 times more likely to die from heart disease
[55:27.840 --> 55:31.200]  than from a terror attack you're nine times more likely to choke to death
[55:31.200 --> 55:33.360]  from your own vomit than down a terror attack
[55:33.360 --> 55:36.400]  you were eight times more likely to be killed by a police officer
[55:36.400 --> 55:40.000]  than by a terrorist you were eight times more likely to die from accidental
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.800]  electrocution than from a terror attack you're six
[55:42.800 --> 55:46.480]  times more likely to die from hot water than from a terror attack
[55:46.480 --> 55:49.040]  and of course for many times they don't have this number here but you can look
[55:49.040 --> 55:50.960]  it up I think it's four times more likely to
[55:50.960 --> 55:54.400]  die in a sporting accident just in the sport of football
[55:54.400 --> 55:59.520]  counting high school and league and the college and professional
[55:59.520 --> 56:03.920]  but it doesn't matter because it's fun to get scared
[56:03.920 --> 56:08.480]  and so hey you don't want private property second amendment
[56:08.480 --> 56:12.720]  if the fetish of listening to neocon talk radio and
[56:12.720 --> 56:16.400]  talking you know 50 hours out of the week
[56:16.400 --> 56:20.640]  about how evil muslims are then knock yourselves out folks
[56:20.640 --> 56:24.880]  oh but oh by the way al-qaeda is openly working for the west against qaddafi
[56:24.880 --> 56:28.640]  on record and they're putting the al-qaeda based
[56:28.640 --> 56:32.000]  muslim brotherhood in power in egypt they just had a new poll out that they
[56:32.000 --> 56:36.400]  like bin laden better than better than obama and you're like why are they
[56:36.400 --> 56:39.360]  doing that because they got to have an enemy it's full spectrum
[56:39.360 --> 56:44.080]  dominance see it's global banks that run our military that sit on top of us
[56:44.080 --> 56:48.480]  and move the al-qaeda chess piece around wherever they want to invade
[56:48.480 --> 56:51.840]  it's like corrupt cops pulling you over if they want your car or your house
[56:51.840 --> 56:55.520]  and coming into your house that you wouldn't sell and say oh we found cocaine
[56:55.520 --> 56:58.640]  look here oh we found a bin laden in your country
[56:58.640 --> 57:03.760]  we found an al-qaeda we found him right here we're taking it we're taking it
[57:03.760 --> 57:07.440]  and idea doesn't matter though the government's good i know i know
[57:07.440 --> 57:11.920]  by the way uh it's being reported post office suspends retirement
[57:11.920 --> 57:15.280]  contributions the financially troubled post office is
[57:15.280 --> 57:18.000]  suspending its employer contribution to the federal
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.160]  employee retirement system the ages at wednesday it was acting to conserve
[57:22.160 --> 57:25.680]  cash as it continues to lose money it was eight billion in the red last year
[57:25.680 --> 57:28.960]  because of the combined effects of the recession
[57:28.960 --> 57:32.480]  and so basically what's happening now is they're just not going to quote match
[57:32.480 --> 57:35.600]  the money you put in i guess they're just going to take the money out of your
[57:35.600 --> 57:38.480]  check and you'll never get it because you're never getting any of it
[57:38.480 --> 57:42.160]  oh they're going to get you to riot as government employees later and push for
[57:42.160 --> 57:47.040]  total taxes and austerity on everybody else to get maybe 10 20 percent of it
[57:47.040 --> 57:50.640]  that's how they keep you hostage they mix all the public and private
[57:50.640 --> 57:53.600]  investments and retirement funds into the derivatives
[57:53.600 --> 57:57.360]  destroy that and then say now you got to give us whatever we want
[57:57.360 --> 58:01.440]  or you'll never get anything the move underscores the need
[58:01.440 --> 58:06.800]  for congress to make bold quick and substantive reforms the postal service
[58:06.800 --> 58:10.240]  and of course those reforms will be um taking your pension funds
[58:10.240 --> 58:13.360]  that you paid for but they've sold it the media you don't deserve it
[58:13.360 --> 58:17.920]  and they're announcing in europe and moving towards in the u.s to go after
[58:17.920 --> 58:21.520]  totally private pension funds the government's going to take them over
[58:21.520 --> 58:25.200]  to protect them and take part of it of course
[58:25.200 --> 58:30.240]  but hey government wouldn't hurt us after all 11 years ago they started taking
[58:30.240 --> 58:34.640]  all the veterans death benefits but hey if you don't agree with that you're
[58:34.640 --> 58:38.080]  with al-qaeda all right we'll be right back with more

[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.520]  bizarre article up at drudge it says they're suspending the employer

[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:47.520]  but then it goes on to say later though that we will continue to transmit the
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:52.240]  opm employees contributions to the fers fund
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:56.160]  and also will contribute and continue to transmit employer automatic

[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:11.040]  there if you can make heads or tails of that good luck that
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:15.680]  that's what i mean how how how double-thinky uh all of these uh different

[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:37.440]  but right now let's go back to your calls let's talk to peter in washington
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:42.080]  you're on the air hello alex um about a can you hear me
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:45.920]  there's a can okay about a month ago uh vinson
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:50.240]  booblyos he was on your show when he made some statements i disagree with it
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:54.720]  i'll uh i'll i'll give an answer to to the first of all we taught that the
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:02:00.400]  bible uh teaches uh the uh predestination of individual
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:04.800]  souls now the general source of that is romans
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.720]  but in the book of romans what paul is really saying
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:14.160]  is that the jews have lost their status as the chosen people
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:18.480]  and that he can set them up or take them down
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:25.760]  now an excellent uh statement of that is made by john lock
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:32.640]  in uh his essay on romans john lock which john lock well the famous
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:37.840]  philosopher that flourished in the late 17th and early 18th
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:42.400]  century you can get this on interlibrary loan
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:46.400]  i think it's under title is the epistles of saint paul
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:49.760]  all right the second point he brought up as he said that well god
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:57.600]  far hardened pharaoh true but first pharaoh hardened himself
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:04.320]  now you have to look at it the way it it really means
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:07.760]  well listen here's got a lot of peter peter here's the deal
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:13.760]  i had him on uh you know really i was going to set him up to talk about
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:17.840]  jfk but then once he got on he said no i'm going to talk about my book
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:22.400]  uh you know that basically is agnostic and so it turned into that and i don't
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:25.040]  really have long you know religious debates here
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:30.800]  but obviously uh boogliosi just has this appeal to authority and he's the
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:34.560]  expert and he knows everything and so it just becomes a big
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:37.840]  distraction look we don't screen phone calls and so it's interesting that you
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:40.800]  called in about this i mean i i think it's informative to a
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:43.520]  certain point but obviously reading the bible in my
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:47.360]  own opinion it says man has free will but then it gets into that
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:50.000]  argument well but god already knows everything that's going to happen so he
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.720]  knows what you're going to do um but look i i mean it just kind of
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.800]  gets into these how many angels can dance on the head of a pen situation
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.960]  while our whole country is going into global receivership through fraud
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:07.280]  world war three or a new world war is is is starting to kick off
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:11.040]  uh and then we're sitting there debating you know i know it all like
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:16.720]  Vincent boogliosi uh and then and then you know talking about
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:20.320]  you know things like that i mean it's just i mean really i think it's pearls
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.120]  before swine what do you think peter
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:27.760]  well uh there might be some people that are kind of ignorant that
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:33.680]  would listen to him so i'm not talking to him necessarily but to those people
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:36.160]  now i'd like to finish my point on the hardening of
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:41.280]  uh have ferro's hardening in those days uh
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:47.440]  the an act of god was anything that was done according to the laws
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:50.560]  you know that the principles that he made and a man that is
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:54.400]  is stubborn eventually it becomes part of his nature

[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:44.240]  now lindsay williams was on with us in october
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:47.840]  and he said the middle east is going to have a big crisis and explode into
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:53.200]  flames that's what 10 from who's now died that we can
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:56.720]  reveal the former head of atlantic richfield told him from also in his
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:00.800]  other source the other mr. x who i know the name of it we can't reveal
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:05.040]  back in 2008 six months before it happened he said in six months oil's
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:09.440]  going to go from 40 a barrel to 150 it went to 149
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:14.640]  then he said okay now it's 149 it's going to drop to 40 it actually went to
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:19.120]  35 or so now it's going to slowly grow for the next few years
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:23.360]  but then it's going to start rocketing up and then last october he said within
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:28.320]  six months to a year it'll be 150-200 a barrel
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:32.880]  he then went on from his sources who were high-level globalists and kind of
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:36.800]  have a rule they'd like to tell you what they're going to do to you
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:40.400]  that after the big middle east destabilization next would be china
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:45.200]  the death of the dollar around 2012 and so there's another four five months
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:48.560]  three or four months here to see if the if his source was a hundred percent
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:51.200]  accurate and he's been accurate almost everything
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.840]  but the globalists aren't all powerful they're not god
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:57.680]  and they've only gotten oil up to 105 or so a barrel
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:01.200]  now will they run it up will they run it up
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:07.520]  250 or more now now his source who lives out of the country most of the time
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:11.360]  has been begging him to get on an airplane and travel there and to go to a
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:16.640]  quote special briefing and we're breaking this information here
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:20.720]  today uh lindsay actually uh what a couple days ago
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:24.400]  trying to get ahold of us but he first covered it on dr stan montip we're
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:27.760]  going to be able to expand into this information during this hour a little
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:30.720]  bit into the next hour but i promise we will get to your calls because i want
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:34.160]  to hear your questions but there's no doubt
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:38.160]  the first great war of the 21st century is happening it's multi-region
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:42.640]  multi-continent they admit they're using muslim brotherhood al-qaeda
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:46.400]  types all over to overthrow the governments and then
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:54.880]  fight the governments from syria uh to uh egypt to now of course libya and all
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:58.400]  of this is starting to come to a head and the nato alliance is really starting
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:01.440]  to break up uh germans pulled out two months ago
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:06.640]  we're now three plus months into this idly today this is big news
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:10.320]  uh said uh we're not going to be part of this
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:13.360]  so so this is huge the chinese have come out and said we're dumping all the
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:17.760]  treasury bonds uh the fellow reservists said we are going to do qe3 remember
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:20.960]  they said they wouldn't a month ago now they're back saying they will
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:25.440]  further dollar devaluation i mean earth shattering events are happening
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:28.480]  just like you saw in the buildup to world war one or world war two
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:33.200]  i get chills when i talk about this i mean this is it is on
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:40.320]  okay a great time of of of upheaval is upon us and
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:43.600]  we got a lot out of bill berg two weeks ago we'll see how that matches with the
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:47.680]  intel lindsay has the quiet friend what we got at bill berg last year and this
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:52.800]  year just absolutely seamlessly fits in and that's what we got from tucker
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:55.760]  bill berg wants a hundred and fifty i mean he
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:59.360]  tuckers even now name the names of who said what in the meetings
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:02.640]  they want to bankrupt the planet with high oil prices but they want to bring
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:05.520]  down saudi arabia something sounded crazy in october the
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:08.720]  Saudis have now run to china run to russia they're openly saying they're
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:12.320]  trying to destabilize us they've handed out 20 something billion in one
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:16.320]  doll 34 billion in another 10 i mean they're giving people 10
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:20.400]  thousand 20 thousand dollar payments every few months individually
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:23.680]  so that the west can't get them to rise up and overthrow them
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:29.360]  why are they double crossing the Saudis the the the globalist allies who are
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:32.560]  horrible i don't like their government why are they double crossing mubarak
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:35.760]  why are they double crossing qaddafi who made deals with them six years ago and
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:40.240]  invested tens of billions with goldman sacks why is this happening
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:45.760]  because they need this global meltdown as a pretext to say oh we're having a
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:49.760]  global depression not because of the fractional reserve banking and the big
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:54.320]  six megabanks but because of the Arabs it's their fault and so we've got to go
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:58.800]  in to cut back the oil prices and that's exactly what bill de berg saying
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:01.760]  now now lindsay we appreciate you breaking this and really going into it
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:05.760]  in full detail here today you have traveled out of the country to meet with
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:09.600]  the even higher level you know even bigger oil company
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:14.880]  absolute ceo farmer head who's giving you this information and almost
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:17.760]  everything he says come true but out of the gates where he gives us the new
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:22.640]  briefing you said in october six months to a year 150 or higher
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:26.400]  uh are they going to be unable to carry this out because they weren't able to
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:29.920]  overthrow saudi arabia or what's happening
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:33.760]  here the mr x of my book the energy non crisis who is
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:38.320]  still alive has been asking me to go to a briefing outside the united states of
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:42.560]  america well i finally picked up my family and we all went
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:46.640]  many of you have been wondering why you have not heard me on any radio show
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:50.800]  for probably a month now some of the things that i saw
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:55.440]  and heard in this briefing i cannot say on your show
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:59.840]  alex because if i did you would probably have the same thing happen to you
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:03.920]  that one famous man who was on fox news had happened to him
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:08.480]  they relieved him of his job originally your own genesis network
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:13.840]  so you have to kick that when i came back to the united states of america i
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:17.200]  literally wanted to kneel down and kiss the ground
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:21.760]  believe me uh i've never been so glad to be back and by
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:26.080]  the way i have you out there noticing artists i did not go outside the united
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:29.760]  states of america in order to find out if it was some other place i want to move
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:33.360]  to i am here to be with you to see this
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:37.360]  entire thing battled out from the beginning to the end and alex
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:41.120]  i'd like to invite you sometimes to go with me
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:44.880]  on all these briefings you come back i promise you
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:48.720]  uh a different man now the mr x of my book
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:53.120]  you know where he is uh not mr form you know he passed away about six seven
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:58.320]  months ago but the mr x of my book is over 70 years of age
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:02.160]  and it's almost as if he has become like mr form
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:06.160]  to the point that let me just go ahead and tell him everything i don't care if
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:10.000]  you think you can get by with it do it so as a result
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.920]  you appreciate folks have a pencil and paper handy today
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:17.280]  because i'm going to give you some facts and figures the statistics and names
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:20.000]  and dates that have never been given because
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.360]  up until monday this week i didn't even know it myself
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:29.360]  but i got back in the country uh my mr x and i spent a lengthy period of time on
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:34.160]  the telephone last friday and then again on monday up this week
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:38.400]  basically going over all of the things that i could say
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:42.560]  without getting in trouble now alex the first thing i want to do today
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:47.280]  is congratulate you i don't think you realize
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:51.440]  just how much you and a number of other radio talks you'll host in the country
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:58.160]  have have upset the elite uh you have succeeded and here's the first thing
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:03.280]  you've succeeded in doing because of what you and others like you
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:06.720]  have done the elite have decided here's the first
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:09.760]  this is not a prediction this is an outright statement
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:12.560]  you take this i'm not going to say take it to the bank because i won't take
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:16.880]  anything to the bank but you can believe this one and enjoy it
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:20.000]  there are a few things that are encouraging about what i heard and saw
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.520]  first of all because of the american people waking up too rapidly that the
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:29.760]  elite are scared to death many of you remember that i have said
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:32.000]  numbers of times on the alex jones show
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.200]  that when i lived with the elite of the world for three years one of the first
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:38.400]  things i found out was that there's only one thing on the
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:42.640]  face of the earth they're afraid of they are scared to death of the masses of
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:45.520]  people waking up stay there stay there lindsay the key
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:49.600]  information glad you're breaking it here uh we're going to come back
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:54.320]  after break and we're going to get into to the fact that the elite are scared of
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:57.200]  the awakening that's the same thing tucker sources
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:00.800]  and other sources confirmed out of bill deberg two weeks ago
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:05.040]  since 2007 the federal reserve and the u.s government have injected as much as
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:09.600]  20 trillion dollars into the economies of the world and yet the globes economies
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:12.880]  continue to contract our government is borrowing 58
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:17.360]  thousand dollars per second if they stop spending the economy collapses if they
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:21.840]  continue spending the economy collapses and if they raise interest rates the

[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:15.040]  lindsay williams is our guest and what he's saying
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:19.360]  really integrates him with what jim tucker has said
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:22.160]  jim tucker from his bill de berg sources has been able to say
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:25.280]  barlin wall will fall next year it's going to be staged
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:29.200]  margaret thatcher will be out within two months she didn't go along with this
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:32.800]  george w bush is going to endorse in the next three months global warming
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:36.240]  people laughed at that he has predicted
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:40.000]  because these people steer the planet they don't totally control it
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.760]  but they're able to influence it they're trying to set up a total world
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:48.320]  government so they do run it but they certainly run this nation they're
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:51.920]  running into the ground but the fact that
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:55.760]  germany's pulled out of the invasion italy's now pulling out of this new
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:59.440]  world war they're trying to start that's exactly what we got from tucker is
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:03.760]  that they are scared to death they are upset they know that europe isn't going
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:06.960]  to go along with the more bailouts
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:11.040]  lindsay you you traveled to meet with this high-level globalist
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:14.880]  and he said look i'm just going to give it all to you briefly why did he i mean
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:18.880]  did you ask him why and then b you've got new information i told you during the
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:22.640]  break i know fox news ran back off because he
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:26.400]  was going too far um and so now you know he's just
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:30.000]  going to internet like we do you know with the full scoop i guess we hope
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.240]  we'll see what happens uh but i i don't care whatever you were told
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:37.680]  lay it out here buddy hit them with both barrels go ahead
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:42.080]  congratulations alex you have succeeded you can call yourself
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:46.560]  a success too many americans are waking up and
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:50.400]  revolting against the elite system and as a result
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:53.360]  here is the first way in which they've backed off
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:58.160]  gasoline will not go above five dollars a gallon
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:02.320]  they had planned to take it to six to seven before the summer was over with i
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:05.920]  said that on your show back about two months ago
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:09.040]  they now have said to me on the phone on monday morning
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:13.440]  this mr x and my book energy nine prices he said chaplain is going to go to
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:16.640]  no more than five dollars in any place across america
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:19.440]  on through the rest of so you didn't learn that when you travel to meet with
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:23.280]  him this is a new development no the number of things that we talked
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:26.800]  about on the telephone uh after i got back here
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:30.800]  and this just happened to be one that he said yeah go ahead and say all this you
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:33.280]  want to because he said people will enjoy
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:37.200]  five dollars a gallon gasoline now many of you remember whatever i said
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:40.240]  about two and a half years ago is hundred forty seven dollars a barrel to
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:44.320]  fifty dollars a barrel and within three months it took place exactly as they
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:47.760]  told me it would but you can count on this also
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:52.400]  they have had to back off slightly because too many of you were waking up
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:57.680]  and they were fearful that uh that the american people were going to revolt
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:02.000]  so they and the first thing they've limited is five dollar gallon gasoline
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.280]  for the rest of this summer secondly my dreams alec have finally come true
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:10.640]  now this one i want you to go improve for yourself some of it you can get some
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:13.680]  of it you cannot hope you have pencils and paper
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:18.320]  in my book the energy non-crisis there is a chapter entitled if gall island

[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:26.560]  all of you out there if you want a copy of energy non-crisis and to seducination
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:30.240]  i don't sell them but if you want the copies of those books

[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:53.120]  because very few people willing to believe that i actually saw what i saw
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:56.960]  that day you're ready here it is if that pencil and paper is ready
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:03.760]  uh you want to write this down the largest oil rig ever built on the face of
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:07.840]  the earth within the past few weeks has been moved to brutal bay
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:10.720]  alaska write it down you're going to hear this
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:13.920]  talked about you think the gulf of mexico was big
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:17.680]  you think the strike that they hit in the gulf of mexico was something
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:21.280]  phenomenal you haven't seen anything yet
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:26.800]  i was in that room that day 35 years ago i saw the largest oil pool on the
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:31.280]  face of the earth discovered in order to classify it within 24 hours time
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:35.920]  they are finally about to open it up and what i tell you in a moment why they're
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:41.440]  going to open this up you are going to be startled
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:45.040]  okay i'll give you the name of it and the place and what they're going to do
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:48.160]  so that you prove it for yourself and though i'm right
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:54.480]  they call it the liberty rig l-i-b-e-r-t-y biggest oil rig ever built on the
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:58.160]  face of the earth and it is placed right near west
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:04.000]  dock on the arctic ocean approximately two miles from what i call gall island in
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.240]  my book energy and on crisis and they are going to drill
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:12.160]  listen to this i mean i still am done founded what i heard
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:16.880]  they are going to drill eight miles did you hear this
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:21.120]  now this one told me yesterday just the other day they're going to drill
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:25.440]  eight miles with this biggest rig ever built on the face of the earth
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:28.880]  into they've named it by the way i call it gall island
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:32.160]  in my book because that's all they called it back in those days
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:36.400]  they're calling it today the lisbon zone not lisbon field
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:40.800]  lisbon zone be sure and quote it correctly and they're going to drill
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:46.400]  eight miles out and hit what i call gall island in my book
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:49.920]  all right stay there stay there we'll break down what mr x told you
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:54.960]  we're gonna do on the other side we're on the march the empire's on the run
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:30:02.640]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:05.840]  hi folks this is alex jones and i want to tell you about the silver lungs
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:09.200]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:12.800]  silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:16.720]  by breathing the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:20.080]  first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:23.520]  the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:27.920]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:31.520]  the silver nano particles instantly into the bloodstream
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:35.600]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:39.120]  you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:43.600]  with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow step-by-step instructions
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:46.480]  are provided making production fast and simple

[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:58.720]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:06.000]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.240]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:13.200]  agenda they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the
[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:16.400]  americans at home and have a tremendous influence
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:20.400]  on our president and congress and they really are calling the shots
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:25.680]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:28.880]  fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:33.280]  the criminal off-short cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:35.760]  and on its ashes constructing world government
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:39.600]  Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:42.960]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:46.480]  nobody does care and right now in washington dc
[01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:51.680]  we have seen a fall of the republic get your copy of fall of the republic on

[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:03.680]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:08.000]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.440]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:15.040]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:18.000]  it's true total government control of electricity
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.520]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:25.120]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:29.040]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:32.560]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:35.680]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:38.720]  onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:42.560]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:46.240]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors
[01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:50.400]  you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:54.480]  that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:33:18.320]  so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:31.600]  we're here live my friends monday through friday from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m.
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:35.280]  central standard time
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:39.520]  after williams and with us about 20 minutes into the next hour i have
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:42.880]  promised to go to your calls for lindsay the folks who are already holding over
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:46.000]  from the last last hour i need john to go through those calls and make sure they
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.600]  can ask a question to lindsay or myself because if it's on a separate issue
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:52.960]  like the bible verses or something and not that i
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:56.480]  mind that we don't screen your calls it just needs to be on topic
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:00.560]  specifically and it's a very wide range of topics with the wars
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:06.000]  the global elites geopolitical program the vast majority of what lindsay
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.080]  williams sources have told him have come true
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:15.600]  the fact that they were planning within just a few months from now
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:18.720]  and if saudi arabia gets overthrown it will happen
[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:23.040]  they have oil go over 150 that could still happen but this is good news
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:27.040]  that lindsay's saying that the establishment is afraid
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:31.520]  uh they were testing it and thought they'd get away with it
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:35.200]  but because of the fact that people are getting so upset
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:39.040]  that they may not go all the way up to 150 a barrel
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:43.360]  that's very similar to what tucker told us from bill deberg
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:46.880]  but his source inside bill deberg sources
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:50.800]  said that that that that they are upset about the awakening but that they
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:54.800]  still want to go up uh but that they haven't been able to
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:58.560]  completely overthrow all these middle eastern countries yet now now
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:02.640]  now lindsay's saying that after this long period of
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:06.960]  consolidation in higher gas prices and the depression then they will develop
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:10.960]  fields all over north america because they had a deal with the
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:16.000]  arabs to not have big fields develop as long as the
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.680]  arabs invested in the u.s dollar in the t bills
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:24.080]  and and and now that deal is ending the saudi arabians and others are leaving
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:27.920]  the dollar the chinese are leaving it all of this is happening a major
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:32.560]  global geopolitical economic military realignments happening
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:35.920]  and that's why there's us ships off syria and marines training for amphibious
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:39.120]  assaults of libya that's why all these new drone attacks are
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:41.600]  starting and pakistan's being ministered and
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:45.040]  troops in afghanistan are being prepared to be moved into other areas
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:48.480]  because there's a standoff going on here
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:51.440]  now now now lindsay we're getting into this big oil rig and why they're
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:53.840]  planning to open up these fields they've kept
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:58.640]  shut since the late 70s that you in 1980 exposed in your book
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:03.440]  uh but but but specifically i mean why are they planning this and then what's
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:07.120]  all the other big news that you traveled out of the country to get
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:11.200]  the price of five dollars the gallon of the gas pump is only temporary
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:15.840]  uh i did not mean to say that this is something that's going to stay this way
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:18.880]  the other reports you're getting are correct they are going to take it to
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:24.400]  150 to 200 dollars a barrel but temporarily because the people like
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:28.800]  you alex waking up so many americans they are going to keep the price of five
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:32.080]  dollars a gallon until they feel the american people who calm down enough
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:36.640]  they can take it further now the next statement that i'm going to make
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:40.080]  uh it will probably affect your life more
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:44.720]  and you've never heard this before this it will affect your life more
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:48.560]  than any other one thing uh that you will hear me say
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:55.680]  ever here goes the elite are getting ready for the day that the
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:02.800]  revolution in the middle east cuts off oil supply they have a target date i
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:06.960]  cannot give it to you uh if it's not too long off
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:11.600]  they have a target date when the middle east will be in such revolution
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:14.320]  started Egypt you remember i announced this on the alex
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:17.920]  john shows alex is in your archives i came on your show
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:21.440]  and i said within four to five months time there's going to be a crisis in
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:24.880]  the middle east and you said lindsay is it going to be with iran
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:29.600]  and i went back to my mr x and i said is that i ran and he said no
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:34.080]  he said this is a crisis of another sort and four months later it started
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:37.600]  exactly as the elite has told me Egypt first
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:41.840]  Libya Yemen marked my words is going to go right on
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:46.320]  into Jordan Syria the final country will be Saudi Arabia
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:50.800]  their plans have not changed in any matter they know the approximate date
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:54.240]  that they're going to be able to do but that's what tucker said two weeks ago
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:59.520]  you said this in october tucker's sources said that they do plan on
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:02.720]  bringing the entire middle east down and they're going to blame
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:06.720]  the oil prices on that and and then blame the depression
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:12.480]  on that but but what you're saying about them gauging going to 150
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:16.160]  you know first it's two bucks they go to three you get mad they go back to 250
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:19.600]  then they go to four then they go back to three then they go to five they go
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:22.960]  back to three and a half they go up to four they go back to 350
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:27.040]  they go up to five they go back to four they're always training us two steps
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:31.360]  forward one step back to where now we think 350 is cheap
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:34.320]  see how we've been conditioned so that's what they're saying is they're going to
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:37.920]  try to move a little bit slower they backed off to five dollars
[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:40.800]  temporarily because of people like you alex
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:44.560]  because people are waking up too fast and the elite are getting scared of the
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:48.400]  public waking up okay put this date down i know we've got a few more minutes
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:51.920]  here only and i got to cover as much as i can i've got another major
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:55.840]  briefing i want to give you here put this date down may the 12th
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:39:00.720]  2011 there was a bill that went before the house of representatives on that date
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:05.040]  it was very quietly done it never hit the national media
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:08.720]  more than likely you never heard about it and this bill that went through the
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:12.560]  house of representatives on that date made the 12th 2011
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:18.640]  there was a vote of 243 to 179 and what were they voting on
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:23.200]  they were voting on something that will startle you they were voting
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:27.040]  to well first of all they they wanted to reverse
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:31.040]  president obama's offshore moratorium act obama has given them some problems by
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:33.840]  the way i can't go into that now for lack of time
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:36.880]  they take a whole program uh let's go back
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:40.720]  they reversed his opinion and they said watch it
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:44.320]  oh please you've got to note this i've been waiting 35 years for this i'm so
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:48.080]  excited i don't know what to do they have given permission for drilling where
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:51.360]  gall island in my book energy non-crisis uh
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:55.920]  it wrote about 35 years ago they're opening up the
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:59.520]  crystal bay area of alaska they are opening up
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:03.360]  the aughtic wildlife refuge i do not know whether this has been through the
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:06.480]  senate or not i can't find out nobody will tell me
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:10.400]  i can't look it up anywhere it did pass the house of representatives
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:13.600]  now why are they doing this they're doing it because
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:16.880]  they know the approximate date that the middle east
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:20.800]  all of the royal family every one of them even the high even the royal family
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:24.640]  of saudi arabia is going to be deposed mark my words oh i'll give you
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:29.200]  another one too just in passing quickly and i can't elaborate on this right now
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:33.520]  we are going to default on the national debt of the united states of america i'm
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:37.040]  not talking about raising the debt limit what you're hearing so much about
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:41.920]  we are going to default on the national debt of 14 to 15 trillion dollars
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:45.760]  that's just in passing they know the approximate time already
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:50.400]  okay well please give us if you have it uh what the plan is what the time frame
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:53.760]  is in the middle east and will they raise the debt limit and then after
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:58.240]  default or or uh what are they looking at doing right now
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:01.360]  i do not know whether they're going to raise the debt limit or not it really
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:04.720]  doesn't matter with them because there's going to be a default on the national
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:09.200]  debt regardless now they have a general idea of how
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:12.960]  much longer it's going to take them to depose every royal family and throw
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:16.400]  down every ruler in every country so far they've
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:19.600]  gotten egypt libya yaman they're going on from here to
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:24.640]  john siria and saudi arabia oman and uh... and uh... the other
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:27.760]  countries will fall in the same time frame
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:32.160]  and whenever they do they must produce the america have the american oil field
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:35.920]  ready to produce by that time is the reason they push through
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:40.640]  oh they paid off i mean literally they paid congressman off to vote
[01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:45.200]  on this thing on may the 12th 2011 uh and pass this bill through the house
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:49.520]  of representative they've got to have permission to drill in these places
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:54.320]  to get the oil ready so that at the time the middle east oil supply is cut off
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:58.880]  the dollar is devastated the national debt can't be paid any longer
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:03.280]  and they've got to have a savior they will step in and say
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:07.760]  okay we have found these monsters new oil fines there's only one problem
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:11.520]  my book energy non-price is told about it 35 years ago and they've got a
[01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:15.520]  problem with that you can read it for yourself if you get a copy of it
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:19.680]  from amazon kindle and these things will be opened up
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:23.680]  at approximately the same time so that they can supply the oil for the united
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:26.800]  states of america and they'll come in and say oh we will
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:32.560]  they can produce it for 60 cents a barrel and they're going to sell it to you
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:37.280]  for you know what people sell it to you for 150 to 200 dollars a barrel now
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:40.880]  the bachon oil reserve in north and south dakota
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:43.920]  and montana if i wanted to make money these days
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:47.120]  i would immediately get an oil rig if i was a young man
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:50.800]  and go up and make a fortune they are punching holes everywhere
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:55.280]  it is light sweet crude they must have it ready for the time
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:59.920]  that the middle east it falls completely the last one to fall is
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:03.520]  sardine arabia when you see sardine arabia fall folks
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:08.480]  you you better put on your listening ears because there's going to be major
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:11.840]  events take place from that point on the bachon reserve
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:15.840]  the reserve under denpa colorado the north slope of alaska
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:19.360]  they must have all of these ready alex by the time
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:23.360]  that the middle east falls i understand that now uh lindsay
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:26.960]  what else i mean you travel out of the country to meet with this guy in in
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:30.480]  person and then you also talked to him last week on the phone
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:34.480]  what else did he tell you because we see them setting up the pentagon takeover
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:38.880]  the internet that's mainstream news today we see the pentagon
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:42.640]  admitting they're going to test cyber attacks on other infrastructures that's
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:46.160]  the cover we see more and more censorship fbi
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:49.520]  shutting down mainline websites for no reason
[01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:54.800]  we see uh the big gold exchange announcing that the way they
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:58.480]  interpret a new law that over-the-counter gold sales can't be
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:02.880]  done now we just see tsa on the streets i mean
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:07.920]  you can see the massive buildup huge marine core amphibious drills
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:11.600]  our intelligence from ford and other bases it's on late september early
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:14.720]  october ground invasion of libya they're taking him out
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:18.320]  one way or the other i mean did your source say why they're going after
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:20.720]  kadafi i mean why do they need to get rid of people
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:23.920]  that were already working with them i know the answer they're double crossing
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:28.640]  them they're going to develop oil fields here now
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:32.000]  that they'd made a deal 30 years ago that's now on record
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.520]  to not develop if they would invest the t-bills they're double crossing the
[01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:38.320]  arabs so they got to i guess have to put in new puppets
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:42.000]  who will go along with that double crossing you know they want to cut off the
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:46.000]  oil from the middle east all together i mean it's not a matter of over-throwing
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.280]  rulers they don't care about mabari they don't care about so they're just wrecking
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:53.360]  everything and bombing the oil fields as they're doing in libya to just
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:57.440]  wreck it yes they're producing more intentionally and here's the part that's
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:02.960]  so startling alex i oh my goodness the elite
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:06.480]  please bear with me here folks you know you know i'm an american you know i'm
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:09.920]  staying here the elite are laughing at the americans
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:15.040]  they think we are stupid i mean if this this is so startling i can hardly
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:19.200]  believe what i heard the elite had been planning for years what they're
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:22.480]  doing right now in the middle east this did not happen just overnight it just
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:25.520]  all happens that i knew about it six months ahead of time but they've been
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:30.720]  planning it for years the elite created the crisis now of course
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:34.640]  uh... here here's what i found the elite
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:38.320]  are laughing at americans because we are so stupid
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:42.000]  that we are allowing this to continue okay listen to the article right here
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:48.320]  and here it is obama our president rejected the opinion of j johnson
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:52.800]  the pentagon general counsel and rejected the opinion of caroling press
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:56.880]  the acting head of the justice department uh... legal counsel
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:59.600]  and the new york time just reported on this the other day
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:04.080]  johnson and press told the white house they believe that the u.s military
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:07.920]  activity of nato uh... led air war over libya
[01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:11.920]  amounted to hospitalities and this president he has given them some
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:15.520]  problem folks understand that i i'm only repeating some of the things i've
[01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:20.560]  heard they said the war powers act of nineteen and
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:23.840]  more powers resolution of nineteen and seventy three
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:27.760]  he has risked his future in politics
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:32.960]  by walking these people and he has to he has no choice
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:37.680]  the elite have told him he's got to do this he must continue to use
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:42.800]  folks this is what's so startling the he must continue to use the american
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:48.160]  taxpayers dollar to overthrow every one of these countries in the middle east
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:54.240]  and you are paying americans you are paying for your own destruction
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:58.320]  and letting this stupid president get by with it i i'm sorry i can't well it's
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:02.160]  more than that i mean that's why they've got you know the singing in host
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:06.400]  uh... for read the zachariah as a car coming out
[01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:10.240]  and saying the constitutions bad let's get rid of it that article
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:15.360]  uh... headline for read uh... zarkaya my pronouncing that right i'm having them
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:20.560]  uh... uh... mental issue today i ran into him when i was at seeing in new york
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:25.200]  a few months ago uh... saying dump the constitution
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:29.440]  obama didn't just not go to congress and break the law and engage in treason
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:33.920]  as his own lawyers have not told him he said i'm doing this to legitimize
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:36.320]  the u n to show that they're the boss so
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:39.840]  this is all about just rubbing our faces in its setting the precedent
[01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:44.160]  to have this tyrant running around starting all these new wars
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:48.160]  killing all these innocent people uh... lying about kadafu i'm not saying he's
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:51.040]  a good guy but the point is that it's been proven it's lies
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:56.000]  rape gangs with the viagra and just like throwing babies out of incubators
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.520]  uh... like they said that uh... sedans people didn't equate that's an admitted
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:02.800]  fraud so so all of this is happening but lindsay going over your list of other
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:06.240]  things he told us because we've gone over some of those other issues a couple
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:09.040]  times now uh... specifically
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:12.640]  uh... the they want to cut off the oil further break the economy then they'll
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:15.840]  come in with the oil supplies they've had for decades
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:20.080]  and start developing those uh... what else did he tell you
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:23.520]  uh... because a lot of good things are happening germany's pulled out of nato
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:27.040]  italy's now pulling out french news agencies reporting
[01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:30.160]  uh... we've got congress moving that to try to block
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:34.640]  uh... a escalation of the war kadafi's holding on
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:37.840]  something that they didn't really think what happened they're gonna have to have
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:41.440]  a ground invasion they're trying to tell us this isn't a war
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:45.840]  even the washington post said yesterday no one's buying obama's bizarre
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:49.920]  statements that this isn't a war many of you have
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:54.640]  viewed my latest dvd presentation there were three dvds that i did
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:58.240]  entitled the middle east the rest of the story
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:02.480]  everything that i said in that dvd has been confirmed
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:07.040]  through the sources that i was just with every bit of it is true
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:12.560]  folks for the sake of your dinner table i plead with you my six dvd set of
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:16.000]  everything the elite have told me for the past two and a half years
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:20.160]  if you have never seen them it's so much for the sake of you sparing your
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:23.920]  household and as a result uh... every bit of this was
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:27.600]  confirmed uh... through these conversations i've had you in just the
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:31.120]  last few days that you the american people
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:36.240]  are literally paying you are paying for your own destruction
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:40.240]  obama our president has been told by the elite what they
[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:44.800]  what he must do he's even risked his uh... his next
[01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:48.880]  election because if this thing goes any further he's in real trouble but he has
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:51.680]  no choice because they've demanded him to do it
[01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:55.360]  and the american people are paying to depose every one of this middle east
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:57.920]  country now must click click i know we've given out

[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:16.800]  pastor Lindsey Williams is our guest we're integrating his
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:20.880]  sources information with the information we got we can have two weeks to go at
[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:26.720]  Bilderberg 2011 and i do know both the sources that
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:30.480]  Williams is using one of them is now public the other is not public but i
[01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:33.600]  know who it is we're gonna come back in the next
[01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:37.280]  hour and take 20 minutes of calls for Lindsey Williams but i was talking to
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:40.400]  Lindsey he said he's gone through most of the new
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:45.760]  information and again it does back up what we got
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:53.120]  basically from Jim Tucker but uh why i mean
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:57.360]  you said that they because there's one more person i know that you know
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:00.720]  but you're saying that it was a briefing and that you were with them
[01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:04.720]  i mean was it more than just this oil former oil company had
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:10.160]  or or and and again why are they telling you this
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:13.200]  well first of all they're telling me this because
[01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:16.880]  of courtesy for the fact that i gave three years of my life to be there
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:19.680]  chaplain years ago i don't think they've ever gotten over this many of these
[01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:22.560]  people have never come in contact with a person like that
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:26.320]  that actually lived with them and i think my job is out of courtesy
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:30.080]  then of course there's the fact that the elite do have a moral code
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:32.960]  and in their moral code they must tell the world
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:36.640]  what they're going to do before they do it now i know some things get out of the
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:38.880]  Bilderbergers meeting such as you've already gotten
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:41.840]  but the other things that didn't get out of that Bilderbergers meeting
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:45.760]  and they know that i'm on shows like yours and many other shows coast to coast
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:48.800]  and all the rest of them across the country and they know that i'm going to
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:52.240]  give this information out and this gentleman told me in two
[01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:55.520]  briefings one on last Friday another one on Monday of this week
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:59.360]  what i could and could not say today and so i'm giving everything that i
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:02.720]  possibly can in order to help you save your dinner table
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:06.400]  in light of the fact that the Middle East crisis is going to escalate
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:09.280]  you will see more and more of the oil fields cut off
[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:13.040]  you're going to see an increase in the price of that oil later on this year but
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:16.400]  they've backed off with the time being in order to keep you quiet
[01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:21.040]  like a frog boiling in a pot and try to keep some people like Alex Jones quiet
[01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:24.480]  which i'm quite sure that they won't succeed in keeping you quiet on me
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:27.520]  Alex because we've got to give this information out
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:32.160]  and there were many many many things that were said
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:35.440]  and the main thing of course i think at this point is the fact that our own
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:39.680]  president is being told by him what to do is risk in his own career
[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:42.880]  and bucking two of the leading attorneys in america
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:46.160]  for the pentagon and for the justice department
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:51.120]  and it is taking taxpayers money and paying for the war
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:54.960]  in the middle east so that they can overthrow these royal families and heads
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:58.080]  of state take the price of food or where they wanted to go
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:02.240]  produce americas on the oil fields and in the turnaround and destroy the
[01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:06.000]  america well lindsay there's no doubt all of this is happening the end game is
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:10.960]  public you were really one of the first from your sources to talk about this
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:14.160]  last october and you can see that it's end game
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:17.760]  by how dangerous all this is for the establishment
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:21.840]  i mean it's bold to finance al qaeda and other
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:26.640]  muslim brotherhood groups to overthrow former allies and then now it's admitted
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:30.880]  that the west foments these rebellions that comes in with military force behind
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:34.240]  it saying oh we've got to protect you you know humanitarian
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:39.760]  groups all they bomb apartment buildings killing families by the score every day
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:43.200]  uh and here's obama the nobel prize peacenik
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:47.040]  it's a sick joke doing all of this and it's happening because that is the end
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:51.680]  game is to uh to just bring turmoil the middle east
[01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:55.200]  uh and uh try to implode the world economy
[01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:59.200]  and bring in this depression you know when they say prop up greece prop up
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:02.720]  Ireland those countries don't even almost that money it is the central banks
[01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:07.120]  that created the derivatives and have now induced them to sign on
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:11.360]  and the imf and world bank even some of the founders of the EU admit
[01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:15.200]  this is all designed to implode countries well alex when i got back to the

[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:48.880]  lurching towards the looming world war scenario and
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:52.240]  to be living this and to see this unfolding and to see
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:55.920]  our government totally hijacked by these
[02:00:55.920 --> 02:00:59.360]  interest makes my head spin and folks who know that i'm not somebody that gets
[02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:02.560]  up here and gets into islamophobia and and and
[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:06.480]  hyperventilates all day about the muslims i know al qaeda was founded by
[02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:10.320]  the cia i know it's a group used to destabilize and overthrow more
[02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:14.320]  moderate countries and i know that in iraq you know they
[02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:18.640]  they they threw out the secular leader and and and put things even worse in
[02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:22.720]  and that's on record and that's the type of enslavement they want for the
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:25.840]  middle east actually and you tell the average good
[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:29.680]  old boy this that you know either thinks al qaeda bad al qaeda good or
[02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:34.160]  america good america bad it's no these are duplicitous multi-spectrum
[02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:38.480]  globalist who fund all the sides and then have a synthesis
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:42.640]  that that leads them to their goal and that made boulderberg group a few
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:45.280]  months ago really upset at their steering committee meeting that tucker
[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:48.640]  had an insider at and the media tried to deny the meeting
[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:52.160]  happened later it came out that indeed kissinger had been there and it was a
[02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:57.200]  secret trilateral commission meeting even had yale come out against us and
[02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:00.880]  some other big big newspapers and it turned out tucker was there and later
[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:04.480]  they had to change their their article and say well okay there was a meeting
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:07.280]  first they tried to claim you know that tucker was nuts and there was no meeting
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:09.840]  and then it turned out that meeting did happen
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:13.600]  i mean tucker doesn't make stuff up i mean he's a hundred percent on target
[02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:18.320]  but looking at this
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:21.440]  they really are trying to create order out of chaos but first they have to
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:26.960]  create the chaos to get that order and they really are trying to
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:30.880]  talking to your sources lindsay how big
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:34.640]  because reportedly from the boulderberg group and also public statements
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:39.120]  they want this to lead even into russia and china down the road and that's what
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:42.080]  from told you in the other source years ago was
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:47.520]  after the middle east look at china and russia china is the big one
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:51.600]  is the big one and even right now with the major crisis in the middle east and
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:55.280]  the stupidity of the president of the united states of america risking
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:57.680]  his career because he's told them they have to
[02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:02.400]  it not all of that is totally insignificant to one thing that i haven't
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:06.320]  talked about today because that wasn't necessarily the briefing that i got
[02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:09.920]  but mr prom told me years ago he said lindsay don't pay attention to what's
[02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:13.600]  happening at all south korea he said never mind the middle east
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:18.720]  he said china is the big one and of course you know what china's done lately
[02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:22.000]  but when i got back to you let me go back into these headlines because it leads
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:25.520]  into this subject and i got back to the united states and saw the
[02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:31.680]  headlines that brotherhood legal party legal in egypt for the first time
[02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:35.040]  they are giving to the muslim brotherhood
[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:39.120]  every single country mark my words this is a prediction based on what i've heard
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:42.080]  from them they will be giving to muslim brotherhood
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:45.280]  every single country when it's taken over listen to this
[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:50.320]  us pushes for immediate transition in yamon why do they want it so quickly i
[02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:54.400]  hope you read that article they wanted because they're ready to give yamon to
[02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:58.640]  the muslim brotherhood just as quick as they can totally take it over
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:03.200]  nations pledge 1.3 billion for libyan rebels
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:08.880]  why find the world are we doing this when if anything could offer was a friend
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:12.960]  before we went in to destroy him and now of course he may as well leave before
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:16.320]  we assassinate him of course this was another headline nato's
[02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:19.840]  rasmussen urges planning for post-caddafi libya
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:23.840]  they already have it planned to do all of this they know exactly what they're
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:26.800]  going to do okay what is china doing because of all of this
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:29.520]  the next headline i saw that startled me so much
[02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:33.760]  china won us debt default idea is playing with fire
[02:04:33.760 --> 02:04:38.400]  folks china knows exactly what's going to happen they already see the handwriting
[02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:41.200]  on the wall and because of this hold on lindsay let's
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:44.400]  briefly finish up with china then we'll go to some collars specifically for
[02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:47.920]  lindsay williams and we've got dr paul craig roberts coming up
[02:04:47.920 --> 02:05:00.800]  basically on the same subject looming world war stay with us

[02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:07.680]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:11.360]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:15.040]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:19.280]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:22.880]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[02:07:22.880 --> 02:07:27.360]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:31.200]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:34.800]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power

[02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:20.320]  mind
[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:25.120]  well china has come out and said
[02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:27.920]  hey you've already technically defaults on the dollar
[02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:31.920]  on your t-bills you've already devalued it you're playing with fire now
[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:35.680]  they're in the news ap today china warns us to keep out of
[02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:40.880]  south china sea us warships have gone in the black sea us ships are off the
[02:08:40.880 --> 02:08:44.800]  coast of syria e you and others are openly calling
[02:08:44.800 --> 02:08:50.400]  for war in syria western back forces are coming in
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:54.480]  out of the curd areas attacking the syrian military
[02:08:54.480 --> 02:08:58.880]  this is a multi-region war being fought through proxies
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:03.680]  and then once the proxy start the war the establishment says it's humanitarian
[02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:09.120]  we must go in and back them up uh this is really how the soviets
[02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:16.320]  in the 1950s and 60s and 70s did it is they would go in and back rebels
[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:20.240]  to over try to overthrow a government the soviets would normally already have
[02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:24.080]  the country right next to that and then they would come in claiming they were
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:29.440]  saving the rebels in a humanitarian way and to see the united states acting
[02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:33.920]  just like the old soviet union really makes me want to throw up
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:38.560]  and then lying and saying it's humanitarian and then it's not a war
[02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:41.840]  and doing all the other things they're doing i mean it
[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:45.680]  it is we've got to wake up from this nightmare so your sources have said
[02:09:45.680 --> 02:09:49.600]  look out big collision with china you've been saying that since last october
[02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:54.080]  what did your sources say uh lensing anything on that
[02:09:54.080 --> 02:09:59.200]  china has invested 97 percent of its holdings here as treasury bills
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:03.120]  they already see the handwriting on the wall they know that the american debt
[02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:06.480]  can never be paid off even the interest on the debt is not being paid anymore
[02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:08.880]  because nation's not showing up to buy it
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:13.280]  and because of that they realized that the proximate three trillion dollars that
[02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:17.360]  they hold now it's not only t bills but the other issues of
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:20.720]  better reserve they know that they're on the verge of losing all of that
[02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:25.520]  they are beside themselves and as a result mr prom told me before he died
[02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:31.440]  and i can see it so plainly now the name of the game is control and he said
[02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:35.360]  china is the big one oh by the way alex justin passing
[02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:38.720]  if the elite ever get to you too much and i know
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:42.560]  i have the problem sometimes too with uh being able to think straight because
[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:45.040]  of things that they say and do and so on
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:50.000]  uh there is a way mr kissinger lived to be over 90 years of age
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:53.920]  because he knows some things now what's happening in the world today
[02:10:53.920 --> 02:10:58.000]  folks uh i don't know how to say it anymore except
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:03.360]  that everything that the elite have planned they are going to that they
[02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:06.880]  will keep their timeline barring divide intervention
[02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:10.880]  and they have said that the end of 2012 is their timeline for a certain
[02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:15.280]  accomplishing certain things and they have verified to me that their own
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:19.200]  target because of the fact that gold prices silver prices set back a little
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:22.160]  bit does not mean that they've failed and it doesn't
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:25.520]  not mean that they failed because they're going to keep prices of gasoline for
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:28.400]  five dollars for short well they always drive silver and gold
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:31.360]  down a little bit and then it retraces that and
[02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:35.120]  goes up even more anybody that wants to see it just search the term
[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:39.280]  11-year gold graphic will put one on screen now i promise to go to some calls
[02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:42.240]  let's jam some callers in here tom in california
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:46.240]  you're on the air thanks for holding hey how you doing alex good
[02:11:46.240 --> 02:11:51.360]  i did brief i just wanted to uh say uh thank you and your amazing crew and uh
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:55.760]  i can actually vouch for uh pastor williams i'd lift a message on the
[02:11:55.760 --> 02:12:00.160]  prophecy uh website he actually called me back so i mean
[02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:02.720]  that tells you what type of man he is he's a no no
[02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:07.280]  lindsay williams is a great guy uh now now now tom do you have any questions
[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:11.360]  or comments well i just uh was curious is this
[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:14.400]  standard operating procedure that they go into a country
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:17.920]  build it up double cross the people i mean it seems like this is like a bad
[02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:22.800]  rerun of saddam hussein you know the globalists are totally
[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:26.720]  cold-blooded it's absolute calculations they cheat each other
[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:31.520]  as well it that's why they're in control because they're totally ruthless
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:35.360]  and are incredibly good liars and we're able to sell to the western world in
[02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:38.880]  the last hundred years letting them control the issuance of currency and
[02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:45.040]  credit lindsay williams uh yes and uh they they know everything
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:47.840]  they're doing that they've planned it well in advance
[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:52.000]  and the end goal of course when it's all when the dust is settled
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:56.480]  uh they bring everything to bankruptcy they in turn get it free of charge
[02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:00.240]  and over a period of years i've tried my best to tell people this lately over
[02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:03.680]  a period of years they will bring it back out under
[02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:08.560]  their control under the new world order back to the place where it was when the
[02:13:08.560 --> 02:13:12.240]  great america was the great nation and that's why they want the global system
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:16.000]  backed up with petrodollars because no matter what currency you have
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:21.760]  there's this new global s dr digital and and and to buy oil you'll have to buy
[02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:25.600]  it in the s dr and other derivatives they've
[02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:28.240]  created and the imf and world bank put out public
[02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:31.920]  papers saying this calling it global government
[02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:35.520]  i mean that's what's so frustrating is it's all right there
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:39.600]  it's just not on the nightly news yeah they are going to issue a new world
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:43.520]  currency it will be backed by gold and silver they must take the price of gold
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:47.280]  three thousand dollars an ounce before they bring in the new currency silver
[02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:49.680]  must be seventy five two hundred dollars an ounce
[02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:52.800]  every bit of it they have a timetable for they're not
[02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:56.240]  accomplishing things quite as quick as they wanted to in the middle east
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:14:00.080]  now of course they're using american dollars to finish off the job
[02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:03.360]  Saudi Arabia will be last folks every bit of it is right there
[02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:06.480]  by the way libya is not going well for them so just like
[02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:10.320]  our awakenings hurting them they're not invincible though i mean i mean
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:16.320]  uh the italians are are are now moving to pull out of the the nato operation
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:20.560]  the germans already pulled out i guess it'll just be the u.s i guess going in
[02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:23.280]  then well if the american people will wake up and
[02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:26.800]  stop this uh this puppet president we've got up there
[02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:31.600]  uh they could stop him to flat on the right now if they don't get congress to
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:35.200]  not be paid off any longer it'll tell them what it cost them to pass this
[02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:37.520]  bill that just went through congress the other day
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:42.320]  uh folk to wake up for goodness sakes to listen to everything you can hear
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:47.120]  alex john say he's not out there just saying something for the fun of it
[02:14:47.120 --> 02:14:51.200]  what you hear on alex john's program every day isn't exactly what the elite
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:54.880]  are telling me these days well i mean all that is is common sense in
[02:14:54.880 --> 02:14:57.600]  history and research you have sources we have sources
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:15:00.960]  this is what's happening and then that's what's so frustrating is this isn't
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:04.240]  about entertainment it's not about being a big radio host it's not about
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:07.920]  lindsay williams being a best-selling author we're trying to warn people
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:10.480]  because we have no future if this doesn't get
[02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:14.400]  turned around and that's what's so painful about this it's what's so
[02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:18.560]  frustrating is geopolitically the bankers control almost every nation on
[02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:22.080]  earth they're overthrowing the last few they don't
[02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:25.760]  by destabilizing and curtailing oil supplies
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:29.440]  the bankers will have the global currency and they'll have the control of
[02:15:29.440 --> 02:15:33.040]  the major oil supplies and the whole world will be
[02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:36.560]  held hostage by them and and and now they're going to start their carbon
[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:40.320]  taxing that the big oil companies are promoting you always get emails
[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:43.760]  you work for oil companies you're seeing global warming isn't real
[02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:47.200]  uh of the top five oil companies they're the ones
[02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:52.720]  along with kin lay that developed the stinking plan with al gore
[02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:56.880]  rick perry was the chief of staff for al gore they're all on the same team i'm
[02:15:56.880 --> 02:16:00.160]  sick of it alex let me put it this way if i may
[02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:05.520]  and it'll help you listeners out there i lindsay williams i never lose any
[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:09.440]  sleep at night i'll worry about any of the things that are
[02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:14.400]  happening in the world nothing ever surprises me
[02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:18.400]  because the elite have told me everything that they're going to do
[02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:24.480]  i have prepared in advance and folks you can do the same thing i will gladly
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:28.080]  tell you whenever people give me a briefing as i've just had
[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:31.760]  over the alex john show i'll gladly tell you what they just told me
[02:16:31.760 --> 02:16:35.200]  and if you will do what the elite have done
[02:16:35.200 --> 02:16:39.920]  and and you know what they're going to do you have nothing to be worried about
[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:44.080]  because you can take precautionary measures in accordance with what you
[02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:48.240]  know they're going to do don't lose sleep over all of this
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:52.240]  well here's the problem though if people if people don't hold you for one more

[02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:13.600]  and bring it in that new world order by the petrodollar and by the control
[02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:18.080]  of oil and it'll be a long long long time down the line before anything changes

[02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:30.560]  we know they've suppressed a lot of alternative energies
[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:35.360]  that they talk about through the carbon taxes how they're trying to shift our
[02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:39.440]  society they're not what they're doing is
[02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:43.680]  they are holding us hostage through the oil system
[02:18:43.680 --> 02:18:47.760]  and and and and then shutting it off at the same time
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:51.200]  to basically totally bankrupt us into their hands

[02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:42.880]  prisonplanet.tv recently after watching some of your old
[02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:46.880]  videos on the web and said well you know i need to pay my part a little bit
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:49.680]  and then thanks for the support couldn't do it without you you have a question for
[02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:54.080]  lindsay williams yes i originally was going to talk about the police state or
[02:24:54.080 --> 02:24:58.160]  hidden science but this is interesting about government default
[02:24:58.160 --> 02:25:01.360]  here because in the past i thought that you know that could really help our
[02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:04.560]  country you know and screw the global bankers if we said you know we're not
[02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:08.240]  going to use 20 percent of our government spending
[02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:12.480]  uh for these uh this is the bankers screwing all the governments
[02:25:12.480 --> 02:25:15.520]  and private people that invested their pension funds with them
[02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:19.920]  and then and then i'm sorry go ahead yeah well that that's what i wanted to
[02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:24.000]  clarify because it you know it would save like the 20 percent of government
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:29.120]  spending but it would screw citizen bondholders and uh
[02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:33.040]  maybe would it help us get rid of the federal reserve
[02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:36.080]  it's to the advantage of the league to bring about
[02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:40.240]  a default on the american debt they have to do it
[02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:44.000]  in order to bring in that new world order and also to bring in that new world
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:48.160]  currency in the meantime it's going to hurt masses of people
[02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:52.560]  through that pension funds through all of the uh stock market
[02:25:52.560 --> 02:25:57.040]  everything else imaginable but the main issue is to bring in the new world order
[02:25:57.040 --> 02:26:00.400]  they have to do this and of course it's going to devastate the united states of
[02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:03.360]  america because other countries are going to hate us for the passion
[02:26:03.360 --> 02:26:08.000]  do you remember the uh the uh agreement that was made with Kissinger way back
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.480]  in the days of the carter administration and others
[02:26:10.480 --> 02:26:14.560]  when he went abroad and said we'll buy your oil we will not produce american
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:17.520]  oil if you'll buy our t bills and securities
[02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:20.080]  well they've been doing this for all of these years because they thought the
[02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:23.680]  american dollar was a reserve currency of the world now they are realizing that
[02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:27.200]  we're just fiction to do them in and cause them to take a loss of everything
[02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:30.640]  they've got but it's all a part of the new world order in order to bring in
[02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:36.880]  that system job appreciate your call it's
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:41.440]  people need to understand the globalists are so wealthy they own the
[02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:45.040]  institutions they own the issuance of the money
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:50.000]  and they they are engaged in economic and military warfare against everyone
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:53.200]  it is a philosophy of a bunch of social Darwinist
[02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:57.840]  anti-liberty uh elitist who are a bunch of psychopaths
[02:26:57.840 --> 02:27:01.600]  and they're waging scientific war against humanity
[02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:05.120]  and they're playing different blocks of humanity and nations off against each
[02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:08.000]  other and they've studied how humans operate
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:13.440]  and and and and they're in control because of their incredible organizational
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:17.440]  skills and because the average person judges the
[02:27:17.440 --> 02:27:21.840]  world by how they are and and and it can't believe that they're evil people
[02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:25.760]  out there uh let's talk to uh rand in new york or on the
[02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:28.640]  air with lindsay williams alex you rock
[02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:31.920]  lindsay you're big on predictions i got a couple i wanted to see what you thought
[02:27:31.920 --> 02:27:39.040]  of uh number one if the tsa manages to make enough people mad in
[02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:42.160]  texas they do finally pass some legislation where they
[02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:45.280]  tell them they can't grope us in the airports
[02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:48.560]  now the fans will blow up an airplane there there's no doubt
[02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:52.240]  i'm betting that that chair top and his minions
[02:27:52.240 --> 02:27:56.400]  will come on they'll they'll have some kind of fall flag underwear bomber deal
[02:27:56.400 --> 02:27:59.920]  and that's immediately what'll have no scare the hell out of texas and
[02:27:59.920 --> 02:28:04.000]  it'll be right back to where it was number two this turkey shoot going on
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:09.680]  libya i'm my personal feeling about this is this less to do about oil
[02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:14.400]  than it is to show the world what the future of war looks like
[02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:18.560]  this is going to be conducted from the air it's going to be our drones
[02:28:18.560 --> 02:28:23.120]  unmanned drones going in mopping the situation up until they whip the
[02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:26.080]  opposition down and then we'll go set some ten-pot
[02:28:26.080 --> 02:28:28.400]  dictator up they'll do what we want them to do
[02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:32.240]  while the border of mexico is wide open and you know
[02:28:32.240 --> 02:28:35.600]  how much is how much is it going to take for hajis to come across wrapped in a
[02:28:35.600 --> 02:28:38.800]  barrel of marijuana come up here and start torturing places that are
[02:28:38.800 --> 02:28:42.560]  suffering from droughts that's what we need to be watching out for
[02:28:42.560 --> 02:28:46.880]  i hear you i appreciate your call um lindsay this is the future of war
[02:28:46.880 --> 02:28:51.600]  unmanned helicopters and drones running around slaughtering people with a

[02:28:55.280 --> 02:28:59.120]  joke but we're doing it we're doing it for the elite
[02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:03.040]  they want us to do this they're using the american taxpayers dollar
[02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:06.240]  and using the american taxpayer as the scapegoat
[02:29:06.240 --> 02:29:10.160]  in order to close down the middle east egypt libya
[02:29:10.160 --> 02:29:16.560]  yaman jordan syria oman last saudi arabia last saudi arabia i hope i'll
[02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:20.320]  say this three times last saudi arabia when you see it hit

[02:35:56.960 --> 02:35:59.600]  wall street journal editor former head of policy department of
[02:35:59.600 --> 02:36:03.680]  education syndicated columnist we carry his great reports
[02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:07.840]  at info wars.com and prisonpana.com he's written a lot of powerful articles
[02:36:07.840 --> 02:36:11.040]  the last few days it's always great to have him pop in via video
[02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:14.720]  skype with us and doc i threw out a few of the things you've
[02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:19.120]  written about but front and center the washington post
[02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:22.240]  and others have had to come out and say basically nobody
[02:36:22.240 --> 02:36:27.360]  is buying anymore that the nobel peace laureate is a man of peace and that these
[02:36:27.360 --> 02:36:31.360]  wars in yemen and libya and the overthrow in egypt and the
[02:36:31.360 --> 02:36:35.040]  ships massing and the surrogate groups attacking in
[02:36:35.040 --> 02:36:39.760]  syria out of curtistan that the fact is this is
[02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:44.480]  really a new world war via proxy uh where do you see all of this going from
[02:36:44.480 --> 02:36:48.800]  your research i mean this is this is pretty scary stuff
[02:36:48.800 --> 02:36:52.880]  well alex i i think there are there are two ways it can go
[02:36:52.880 --> 02:37:00.400]  i it could go into direct american confrontation with
[02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:05.440]  china and russia it looks on the surface like that's where it's headed
[02:37:05.440 --> 02:37:09.680]  right now because of libya there we're driving them out of
[02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:14.960]  their oil investments and the syria thing is about the
[02:37:14.960 --> 02:37:20.080]  russian naval base at tartis and so we're trying to
[02:37:20.080 --> 02:37:25.600]  overthrow the Assad regime in order to get a puppet in there that will evict
[02:37:25.600 --> 02:37:31.040]  the russians from their only Mediterranean naval base so then
[02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:37.360]  the Mediterranean sea belongs to us so it could go into a direct confrontation
[02:37:37.360 --> 02:37:42.400]  right now we hide behind Arab protest and pretend that this is
[02:37:42.400 --> 02:37:46.880]  something that's directed at qaddafi in Assad and it's really
[02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:51.840]  directed at china and russia on the other hand
[02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:56.400]  what could happen is that just about every country now
[02:37:56.400 --> 02:38:01.760]  has serious internal problems apparently china as well as russia
[02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:07.920]  and and what kind of war we could end up with is just chaos that is
[02:38:07.920 --> 02:38:14.080]  not a world war two type situation or even a vietnam type or even an
[02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:20.560]  iraq type but just all kinds of chaos internal in each
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:27.280]  country from dissatisfied citizens global bedlam triggered by the global
[02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:32.960]  dollar devaluation correct by that by the bubbles
[02:38:32.960 --> 02:38:37.360]  the asset bubbles by the in the west of course by the theft
[02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:42.160]  by the bankers as you see in Greece and spain you know these
[02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:46.480]  this isn't played up as you know in the american media but these people have
[02:38:46.480 --> 02:38:52.240]  been in the streets for weeks and weeks and so and then cross
[02:38:52.240 --> 02:38:58.960]  border skirmishes you know this this article that i
[02:38:58.960 --> 02:39:03.440]  recently wrote about the economy all showing when you have an established
[02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:09.680]  establishment figure like michael spence a nobel prize winning economist
[02:39:09.680 --> 02:39:16.960]  writing in the establishment journal of the council on foreign
[02:39:16.960 --> 02:39:22.800]  relations that the united states faces a serious structural
[02:39:22.800 --> 02:39:29.120]  challenge in terms of the quantity and quality of jobs
[02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:32.400]  then how long before americans are going to be
[02:39:32.400 --> 02:39:36.720]  in streets like the greeks and spanish so
[02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:41.120]  it could go it could go either way or both ways
[02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:44.560]  and the response to all sorts of internal
[02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:48.320]  unrest it could be to fulminate
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:54.480]  a major war this of course is extremely risky because of the nuclear
[02:39:54.480 --> 02:39:59.120]  weapons the united states china russia they all
[02:39:59.120 --> 02:40:04.240]  have immense quantities of nuclear weapons
[02:40:04.240 --> 02:40:08.160]  and most likely not any of those countries
[02:40:08.160 --> 02:40:12.720]  would be willing to sort of be run over by the other
[02:40:12.720 --> 02:40:16.480]  so i think the world is at an extremely high
[02:40:16.480 --> 02:40:21.600]  level of risk of essentially annihilation
[02:40:21.600 --> 02:40:25.120]  and that the american government is the most
[02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:28.720]  irresponsible government that the world has ever seen
[02:40:28.720 --> 02:40:32.960]  because all the troubles that are producing this
[02:40:32.960 --> 02:40:36.640]  come mainly out of washington and wall street
[02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:41.760]  and they cease that they never cease to continue on these
[02:40:41.760 --> 02:40:45.680]  paths that are producing this extraordinary turmoil they destroy
[02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:49.920]  the dollar which affects the whole world as you said the price is a food of
[02:40:49.920 --> 02:40:54.880]  energy and they are behind so much of the
[02:40:54.880 --> 02:40:59.120]  rebellions and troubles and so it's almost
[02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:03.120]  like the united states is or washington let me put it that way
[02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:07.920]  washington is determined to destroy not only themselves but the rest of the
[02:41:07.920 --> 02:41:11.680]  world and that looks to me like what the real picture is
[02:41:11.680 --> 02:41:16.160]  and we're seeing more and more reckless behavior by people like weiner
[02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:19.600]  this is a senior congressman in homeland security
[02:41:19.600 --> 02:41:22.960]  a committee highly involved in so many issues and
[02:41:22.960 --> 02:41:27.200]  so many of these elitists now are so unstable they're sending photographs
[02:41:27.200 --> 02:41:30.640]  around you know the images of their of their member
[02:41:30.640 --> 02:41:35.760]  and then trying to blame breitbart for it saying he's you know that it's a
[02:41:35.760 --> 02:41:39.440]  conspiracy and if you don't believe that you're a conspiracy theorist dr robert
[02:41:39.440 --> 02:41:42.560]  i'm seeing two things happen i want your comment on this
[02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:46.320]  and then you can comment on weiner but i'm seeing two things happen
[02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:49.840]  i'm seeing a lot of people come out and state the obvious like the nobel prize
[02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:54.320]  winner saying globalism destroyed us and other you know other high
[02:41:54.320 --> 02:41:57.680]  power people coming out being honest about hey this is a war
[02:41:57.680 --> 02:42:01.200]  our elite is insane we were headed towards global
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:06.560]  you know degeneration and multi-region wars that have high casualties that's
[02:42:06.560 --> 02:42:09.360]  the definition of a world war all of this going on
[02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:13.840]  so so you have one group of people folks stepping out being honest going man this
[02:42:13.840 --> 02:42:19.520]  has gotten bad but then other people like ferried
[02:42:19.520 --> 02:42:23.360]  zarkaria and saying the constitution's bad get rid of it
[02:42:23.360 --> 02:42:30.960]  and bizarre statements by obama saying no i define this as peace so it is peace
[02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:35.360]  so it's like they're trying to pile on and make us buy their delusion
[02:42:35.360 --> 02:42:38.560]  and then meanwhile they're taking photos of themselves and sending it to women i
[02:42:38.560 --> 02:42:41.920]  mean
[02:42:41.920 --> 02:42:48.560]  yeah it's uh it's amazing i agree that absolutely amazing i think that um
[02:42:48.560 --> 02:42:55.040]  we can't look to any hope in either party in fact it's not really two parties
[02:42:55.040 --> 02:42:58.800]  anymore with with the the destruction of the unions
[02:42:58.800 --> 02:43:02.560]  the democrats are subject to the same wall street
[02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:07.200]  military security complex apex financing that the republicans are
[02:43:07.200 --> 02:43:10.880]  so we have one party they all serve this
[02:43:10.880 --> 02:43:16.320]  oligarchy of money we have all the various plots that you
[02:43:16.320 --> 02:43:22.320]  expose at times and and all of these plots of course are
[02:43:22.320 --> 02:43:26.960]  working against each other and and as we know the best laid plans of mice and
[02:43:26.960 --> 02:43:31.360]  men often go awry so plots are going awry
[02:43:31.360 --> 02:43:35.760]  there are idiots everywhere with power and
[02:43:35.760 --> 02:43:39.840]  the american people what can they do i think the only answer is what
[02:43:39.840 --> 02:43:43.360]  gerald slenty was talking to you about yesterday when you said
[02:43:43.360 --> 02:43:47.120]  direct democracy we'll just let the people vote on everything
[02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:55.200]  and only a majority decision prevails so of course that's got problems too but
[02:43:55.200 --> 02:44:01.680]  as it is now the people have no voice and the founding fathers always had more
[02:44:01.680 --> 02:44:05.600]  confidence in the people than they had in the elites
[02:44:05.600 --> 02:44:12.000]  or in organizations run by elites so maybe our only recourse
[02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:17.680]  is to somehow just shove the established system out of the picture
[02:44:17.680 --> 02:44:20.800]  maybe we can use all this modern technology like
[02:44:20.800 --> 02:44:25.440]  like was used in egypt and tunisia to get the people together out in the
[02:44:25.440 --> 02:44:30.400]  streets i mean at least they drove a figurehead out of power
[02:44:30.400 --> 02:44:33.920]  but here's the problem with that now the pentagon admits they're building
[02:44:33.920 --> 02:44:37.120]  their own private networks so their revolutionaries
[02:44:37.120 --> 02:44:40.720]  can overthrow they're putting cyber security in place even though they
[02:44:40.720 --> 02:44:43.920]  haven't passed the law here's a headline on a cnet
[02:44:43.920 --> 02:44:47.760]  us building virtual internet as cyber attack tested
[02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:51.120]  right as they try to pass the cyber security act all these cyber attacks
[02:44:51.120 --> 02:44:54.640]  happen they've been caught before staging events
[02:44:54.640 --> 02:44:58.000]  they're clearly putting an authoritarian system in they're clearly getting the
[02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:02.240]  private spy networks up they're clearly fbi shutting down
[02:45:02.240 --> 02:45:09.280]  whole giant computer network you know hosting companies to get it one website
[02:45:09.280 --> 02:45:13.280]  i mean i mean it i mean really we know the answer
[02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:17.040]  they're they're they're trying to destabilize everything
[02:45:17.040 --> 02:45:21.600]  knowing that they can pose then as the saviors in the crises
[02:45:21.600 --> 02:45:24.480]  and grab more more power but there is good news
[02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:27.440]  with the fights against the tsa gaining steam
[02:45:27.440 --> 02:45:30.960]  man you know what just all hades is breaking loose i mean i think it just
[02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:35.200]  comes down to that at the end of the day yes that's what it comes down to and
[02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:40.960]  and more hades will break loose the more people lose their homes their jobs
[02:45:40.960 --> 02:45:44.960]  the ability to function in the established society
[02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:48.720]  as that spreads the turmoil will grow
[02:45:48.720 --> 02:45:55.440]  and i don't know if we can beat the police state to the punch or not
[02:45:55.440 --> 02:45:59.920]  on the whole these private hackers seem to be better at it than the state so
[02:45:59.920 --> 02:46:04.960]  maybe maybe there is a chance for some kind of
[02:46:04.960 --> 02:46:09.200]  fundamental revolution in the structure of government that gets rid
[02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:16.000]  of of what's sitting there uh on the entire world in washington
[02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:20.000]  well as you know history shows that these people go insane and and we've
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:24.160]  had little debates you're saying they're super incompetent but yet there are
[02:46:24.160 --> 02:46:28.480]  you know plots and delusions of grandeur and that i'm saying no they're more
[02:46:28.480 --> 02:46:32.160]  well organized than you're saying but more and more i think it's they think
[02:46:32.160 --> 02:46:36.480]  they're organized they think with their nsa tracking they're able to predict
[02:46:36.480 --> 02:46:40.560]  mass movements and things but at the end of the day i think you're
[02:46:40.560 --> 02:46:44.480]  probably right in in that in that they really don't know what they're doing
[02:46:44.480 --> 02:46:47.840]  and and and at the end of the day are going to just release
[02:46:47.840 --> 02:46:51.600]  abs i mean p i mean they know we're in a depression
[02:46:51.600 --> 02:46:55.200]  they know things are getting worse and they think if they just tell us
[02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:58.720]  everything's great it's gonna make us believe it's better
[02:46:58.720 --> 02:47:03.840]  and i think i think i know the system is is is accelerating their loss of
[02:47:03.840 --> 02:47:08.720]  credibility and then they think that an iron fist is going to back that up i
[02:47:08.720 --> 02:47:11.920]  i don't think it's going to work i mean i think they're going to fail in this
[02:47:11.920 --> 02:47:16.880]  global corporate crime syndicates takeover but they may destroy all of us
[02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:21.360]  in the process that's right they may i think they'll
[02:47:21.360 --> 02:47:24.560]  fail too because there's not enough of them too
[02:47:24.560 --> 02:47:29.520]  too few people are benefiting from the takeover that they have in motion
[02:47:29.520 --> 02:47:35.040]  it's you know it's less than one percent of the population so you've got 99%
[02:47:35.040 --> 02:47:38.160]  of the people who are being screwed by their plans
[02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:44.000]  so that can't work uh even force i don't think can can alter
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.880]  numbers that are that heavily weighted against you well that's another thing
[02:47:46.880 --> 02:47:50.960]  how can they all over the country be laying police off stealing their pension
[02:47:50.960 --> 02:47:54.240]  funds claiming it's welfare you know that police and
[02:47:54.240 --> 02:47:58.000]  fire unions are getting money they put in now they want private pension funds
[02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:02.000]  they're trying that in europe i mean how do they expect the cops to enforce on
[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.800]  us uh the same thing's happening now in greece when
[02:48:04.800 --> 02:48:08.560]  they're going to be robbed as well i mean that that doesn't
[02:48:08.560 --> 02:48:14.080]  that's right and that's exactly and even as we've talked before alex
[02:48:14.080 --> 02:48:17.120]  even if they can get the police to cooperate with them
[02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:23.200]  you have to remember the united states was never able to occupy bagdad
[02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:28.320]  and the only way we ever stopped the carnage that our troops were suffering
[02:48:28.320 --> 02:48:33.040]  was by hiring the insurgents ourselves and putting them on the american
[02:48:33.040 --> 02:48:38.080]  military payroll so unless so if they can't occupy bagdad they
[02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:42.720]  can't occupy the united states and unless they put the entire
[02:48:42.720 --> 02:48:47.280]  population on their payroll uh they've got more problems
[02:48:47.280 --> 02:48:51.200]  potentially than it's possible for them to deal with
[02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:57.040]  so you know i don't think that either party can produce any leadership
[02:48:57.040 --> 02:49:00.800]  because the power of money and the power of the oligarchy is just
[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:06.240]  too powerful is too strong and if any real leader were to appear
[02:49:06.240 --> 02:49:10.240]  within one of the parties he would either quickly be smeared
[02:49:10.240 --> 02:49:15.920]  framed up or they would assassinate and the oligarchy if it went slower
[02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:20.080]  with soft power could have stayed in power even grown their power
[02:49:20.080 --> 02:49:23.440]  but instead i think they're so hubris filled
[02:49:23.440 --> 02:49:27.200]  that they're driving forward with delusions of global domination
[02:49:27.200 --> 02:49:31.520]  and the only threat to oligarchy is is the is themselves
[02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:35.040]  right that's right you know it's just like
[02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:41.840]  Hitler he marched off into russia if he hadn't he'd still be there
[02:49:41.840 --> 02:49:46.560]  so we're marching off everywhere you know in libya and looks like syria
[02:49:46.560 --> 02:49:51.520]  perhaps and they still have them they're talking about sudan now pakistan
[02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:55.680]  oh we only got a few minutes left and five minutes after this break but start
[02:49:55.680 --> 02:49:58.640]  getting into your excellent article that came out a few days ago
[02:49:58.640 --> 02:50:02.880]  you know the redefining of uh of conspiracy theory
[02:50:02.880 --> 02:50:07.040]  now conspiracy theory now is any fact or
[02:50:07.040 --> 02:50:10.480]  any explanation that's contrary to the governments
[02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:16.720]  and the medias so it encompasses almost the whole realm of truth
[02:50:16.720 --> 02:50:20.640]  just about everything is true is a conspiracy theory
[02:50:20.640 --> 02:50:24.480]  if you talk about all the jobs lost to offshoring well that's the conspiracy
[02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:30.320]  theory uh it's not just applied to 9 11 it's now
[02:50:30.320 --> 02:50:34.400]  any disagreement with the government and the official
[02:50:34.400 --> 02:50:38.240]  media that is the conspiracy theory let's break that down the last five
[02:50:38.240 --> 02:50:40.480]  minutes of the show with dr paul correct robert's
[02:50:40.480 --> 02:50:44.160]  also tell you about his uh new edition of his new book that's out
[02:50:44.160 --> 02:50:47.280]  how the economy was lost the world of the world
[02:50:47.280 --> 02:50:51.200]  i'm alec shones the websites are info wars dot com and prison
[02:50:51.200 --> 02:50:55.600]  planet dot tv and this is a fight between truth and lies good and evil
[02:50:55.600 --> 02:51:01.600]  and two plus two equals four if you can say that we can have freedom

[02:54:21.200 --> 02:54:25.360]  over time become more and more decadent more and more sure of themselves
[02:54:25.360 --> 02:54:28.480]  everybody just bows down to them rolls red carpets out
[02:54:28.480 --> 02:54:32.400]  pulls their chairs out tells them they've got the answers
[02:54:32.400 --> 02:54:37.200]  and they're fiddling while rome burns and they've got their cnn host saying
[02:54:37.200 --> 02:54:39.840]  get rid of the bill of rights and constitution they've
[02:54:39.840 --> 02:54:43.760]  they've got their people running around throwing it in our face but
[02:54:43.760 --> 02:54:47.520]  really i believe they're making themselves passay or discredited
[02:54:47.520 --> 02:54:51.600]  by saying everything's a conspiracy theory and i hear it now
[02:54:51.600 --> 02:54:55.440]  where they actually have obama and people saying i say if something's a war
[02:54:55.440 --> 02:54:58.400]  or not and i say it isn't and it reminds me of
[02:54:58.400 --> 02:55:00.800]  carl rove six years ago told the new york times
[02:55:00.800 --> 02:55:04.960]  he said i control reality i say what it is and then you agree is that
[02:55:04.960 --> 02:55:08.640]  understood i mean these people are lunatics but
[02:55:08.640 --> 02:55:11.600]  finishing up with that you know article though about the
[02:55:11.600 --> 02:55:16.640]  new definition of a conspiracy theory is anything not in their false reality
[02:55:16.640 --> 02:55:20.640]  that's right any truth uh for example uh
[02:55:20.640 --> 02:55:24.160]  you're attacked for being a conspiracy theorist because
[02:55:24.160 --> 02:55:29.200]  you revealed truths a russia today you know the tv
[02:55:29.200 --> 02:55:33.600]  station rt they've been attacked by the new york times
[02:55:33.600 --> 02:55:38.160]  uh for reporting and news and opinions that the new york times
[02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:41.120]  doesn't approve of and new york times doesn't report
[02:55:41.120 --> 02:55:46.240]  and therefore their conspiracy theory i told you about the my experience with
[02:55:46.240 --> 02:55:50.320]  the hubbiting posts after they interviewed me on the war
[02:55:50.320 --> 02:55:55.760]  they then found out that i had uh actually reported on some of the findings of
[02:55:55.760 --> 02:56:00.000]  9 11 skeptics you know scientists and so they quickly
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:04.000]  made it an adjustment to their interview with me and they said well you
[02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:08.400]  don't have to listen to him because he's the conspiracy theorist
[02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:13.040]  so uh if you just report facts even without
[02:56:13.040 --> 02:56:17.120]  endorsing them you're now a conspiracy theorist
[02:56:17.120 --> 02:56:22.240]  so i think uh is becoming a badge of honor to be called a conspiracy
[02:56:22.240 --> 02:56:26.400]  theorist because it means you tell truth well that's it i mean i remember
[02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:30.320]  being called a conspiracy theorist for saying bush was lying about wmd's
[02:56:30.320 --> 02:56:34.720]  right and then the fact that they've been caught lying so much
[02:56:34.720 --> 02:56:40.000]  uh really questioning them as it is a conspiracy theory
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:43.760]  having reason not believing people that have a history
[02:56:43.760 --> 02:56:49.440]  of congenital lying that is is not just conspiracy theory it's extremism dr
[02:56:49.440 --> 02:56:53.120]  roberts oh yes of course i mean look see now
[02:56:53.120 --> 02:56:58.320]  they're all over syria accusing Assad of being a butcher and all this
[02:56:58.320 --> 02:57:02.000]  but who's the real butcher it's washington isn't it
[02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:06.160]  you know john pilgers film the war you don't see he shows
[02:57:06.160 --> 02:57:12.560]  that in the current wars that we are waging 90 percent of the casualties
[02:57:12.560 --> 02:57:18.640]  are civilians so for every uh so-called insurgent
[02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:22.800]  or enemy we kill we kill nine civilians well
[02:57:22.800 --> 02:57:27.360]  we've murdered more people than if you took all the deaths of Assad and
[02:57:27.360 --> 02:57:32.400]  and sudam hussein and qaddafi and you multiply by a million you wouldn't
[02:57:32.400 --> 02:57:36.560]  reach the amounts of people the united states governments killed the last 10
[02:57:36.560 --> 02:57:39.760]  years and yet we get on this high horse about how
[02:57:39.760 --> 02:57:44.240]  evil Assad is well he's nothing compared to the united
[02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:50.000]  to bush or cheney or obama or hillary or any of them they're all massive war
[02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:53.840]  criminals but the way he has a peace prize though
[02:57:53.840 --> 02:58:00.000]  i isn't that absurd i mean that's got to discredit that prize for all time i
[02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.640]  think they were to give it to me i just said no you
[02:58:02.640 --> 02:58:09.600]  you keep it it's uh it's well you know you can it's an albatross
[02:58:09.600 --> 02:58:15.600]  the reason they did it was to try to reinforce what they thought was his
[02:58:15.600 --> 02:58:21.040]  inclination to win the war stop but they didn't understand that he would be a
[02:58:21.040 --> 02:58:26.400]  puppet of the same oligarchy that every other president is a puppet
[02:58:26.400 --> 02:58:30.640]  well doctor how dare you question anything when you're walking down steps
[02:58:30.640 --> 02:58:33.840]  at night you shouldn't even look below you that's being a conspiracy theorist
