[00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:10.420]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio experience like no other.
[00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.181]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:13.181 --> 00:00:16.404]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:16.404 --> 00:00:18.825]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:18.825 --> 00:00:22.128]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:22.128 --> 00:00:23.929]  Call Alex now, toll free.
[00:00:24.984 --> 00:00:30.508]  At 877-590-5525.
[00:00:30.508 --> 00:00:37.013]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.013 --> 00:00:40.076]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I am not Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.076 --> 00:00:43.398]  I am Jason Burmess, sitting in for the great Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.398 --> 00:00:45.580]  He's going to be taking off for the entire week.
[00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:52.165]  A much deserved rest, but I can guarantee you this, we're still going to have a blitz of news that the mainstream is not going to be telling you about.
[00:00:53.254 --> 00:00:57.737]  And today I really want to focus on Obama and Biden.
[00:00:57.737 --> 00:01:00.179]  You know, we're going to talk about the financial crisis as well.
[00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:07.365]  But I think it's really important that we talk about Obama and Biden because they're going to be sworn in on the 20th.
[00:01:07.365 --> 00:01:08.986]  And a lot of people out there
[00:01:09.927 --> 00:01:11.949]  Still don't understand what a threat this is.
[00:01:11.949 --> 00:01:16.934]  Now, I'm going to show you that Obama is under the same control that Bush is under.
[00:01:16.934 --> 00:01:20.037]  The same internationalists are backing him, giving him advice.
[00:01:20.037 --> 00:01:33.671]  You know, this should become apparent when people like Henry Kissinger go on CNBC, and we're going to play the clip for you, and say, once again, that this is a great opportunity for our next commander-in-chief, our new leader, to bring in a new world order.
[00:01:34.437 --> 00:01:38.078]  You know, this term just keeps coming up again and again and again.
[00:01:38.078 --> 00:01:43.280]  And, you know, a clip that I didn't get pulled up, but we're going to pull it up, is a Colbert clip.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:52.123]  Everybody enjoys Stephen Colbert, you know, the right-wing pundit that is really just political satire, but he does it well.
[00:01:52.123 --> 00:02:02.807]  And he had John King, one of the seasoned CNN anchors on, and he makes the joke that, you know, now that the media has gotten Obama elected, you know, what's next?
[00:02:03.385 --> 00:02:10.548]  And John King kind of laughs and for some reason he says, well, if you're making the point that Obama is in for a new world order, I'd have to agree.
[00:02:10.548 --> 00:02:12.949]  And we're going to play that for you as well.
[00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:18.712]  Now, you know, Obama himself has talked about a world order on the David Letterman Show.
[00:02:18.712 --> 00:02:19.932]  We're going to play that for you.
[00:02:19.932 --> 00:02:24.474]  I mean, why is it everybody's talking about a new world order and a crisis coming up?
[00:02:24.474 --> 00:02:31.097]  You know, I kind of brushed it off when Biden went on television and he said that, mark my words,
[00:02:31.986 --> 00:02:36.770]  Obama will face a crisis like no other, right when he gets inaugurated.
[00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.411]  You know, what does he know that we don't know?
[00:02:38.411 --> 00:02:42.214]  I kind of said to myself, oh, he's just blowing steam.
[00:02:42.214 --> 00:02:45.377]  He doesn't really have, you know, any kind of inside information.
[00:02:45.377 --> 00:02:46.298]  It's political talk.
[00:02:46.298 --> 00:02:47.419]  It's rhetoric.
[00:02:47.419 --> 00:03:01.610]  But then when you see Colin Powell get on Meet the Press and say that some kind of a disaster that nobody even knows about, but apparently Colin Powell knows about it, is going to occur on the 21st and the 22nd, you know, I'm leaning towards some kind of a financial crisis statement.
[00:03:02.387 --> 00:03:09.089]  And I'm now working on this Obama film with Alex, going over a lot of archive stuff.
[00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:17.012]  And I noticed that a lot of people, insiders, are saying that he's going to come out with some executive orders out of the gates.
[00:03:17.012 --> 00:03:18.613]  And you've got to wonder what that's going to be about.
[00:03:18.613 --> 00:03:21.073]  What are these executive orders going to be?
[00:03:21.073 --> 00:03:30.296]  I bet you anything they're not going to have anything to do with the fake terror threat, and the war in Iraq, and the war in Afghanistan, and they're going to be completely and totally financial.
[00:03:30.296 --> 00:03:31.717]  So I'm leaving the window open there.
[00:03:32.813 --> 00:03:57.900]  Now on the Biden front, it's all over the news that Joe Biden has made a fact-finding mission over in Pakistan to see if, you know, what's going on over there because Pakistan has largely been blamed for these Mumbai attacks, but of course they're supposed to be terrorists, when in fact all the evidence leads back to the Inter-Service Intelligence Agency, or the ISI, and we're going to be discussing the ISI
[00:03:58.365 --> 00:04:00.867]  What their role is and who they really are.
[00:04:00.867 --> 00:04:03.748]  Because Pakistan and Joe Biden go way back.
[00:04:03.748 --> 00:04:06.010]  You know, Biden is a seasoned politician.
[00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:17.397]  He went on the floor of the House in 2001 right after the September 11th attacks because he was well aware that the inter-services intelligence agencies had been funding the so-called hijackers.
[00:04:17.397 --> 00:04:24.921]  And he got up there and he started spitting out, the word should go out to those nations that pretend to be our friends.
[00:04:24.921 --> 00:04:26.382]  Pakistan in particular.
[00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:35.774]  Oh, well, if they're not our friend, Joe, then why were you meeting with the head of the Inter-Services Intelligence Agency in the weeks before 9-11, in Washington, D.C.?
[00:04:35.774 --> 00:04:41.595]  Why was the head of the CIA at the time meeting with them, George Tenet?
[00:04:41.595 --> 00:04:47.336]  Why was the National Security Advisory Board, or the National Security Council, I'm sorry, meeting with this same gentleman?
[00:04:47.336 --> 00:04:56.398]  Why was Bob Graham and Porter Goss, the two people who would co-chair the initial congressional investigation into 9-11, having breakfast with the man in D.C.
[00:04:57.535 --> 00:04:58.576]  On 9-11.
[00:04:58.576 --> 00:05:00.137]  Tell me that.
[00:05:00.137 --> 00:05:01.698]  Well, it's pretty obvious.
[00:05:01.698 --> 00:05:06.361]  First of all, in the late 40s, when Pakistan was working with U.S.
[00:05:06.361 --> 00:05:12.905]  military, really the ISI was a brainchild of British intelligence.
[00:05:12.905 --> 00:05:19.230]  Now, obviously, United States intelligence and British intelligence have worked closely in both World Wars and throughout the last 100 years.
[00:05:21.818 --> 00:05:28.484]  And what's crazy is, of course, in the 70s, the CIA came in in a very overt role.
[00:05:28.484 --> 00:05:40.175]  And when you looked at these Mumbai attacks, the main guy that they were going after had very close ties to not only the inter-services intelligence agencies, which, I mean, in the international media, I mean, India's talking about it.
[00:05:40.175 --> 00:05:41.216]  It's a big story over there.
[00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:45.380]  They know that backstanding intelligence helped in the Mumbai attacks.
[00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:54.912]  So really you have to look at the ISI as a conduit for the CIA, as a conduit for MI5, and really an international intelligence op.
[00:05:54.912 --> 00:06:04.035]  And what Biden is doing there is he's basically seeing how they can cover their tracks and relate better to India and the other people in the Middle East.
[00:06:04.035 --> 00:06:09.977]  Because Pakistan was used as a launching base for the war on terror into Afghanistan and later into Iraq.
[00:06:09.977 --> 00:06:15.619]  You know, Musharraf, you know, our dictator, was really strong-armed into letting these
[00:06:16.843 --> 00:06:18.524]  You know, people stay there.
[00:06:18.524 --> 00:06:26.631]  He saw right away that he could be on the list of a nation that was bombed or would have sanctions against it or was helping terror.
[00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:27.592]  So he went right along.
[00:06:27.592 --> 00:06:32.435]  They've now changed the dictator, but it's the same old policy.
[00:06:32.435 --> 00:06:40.702]  So coming up in the next segment, we're going to play a lot of those clips and we're going to get your commentary in the second half of each hour.
[00:06:40.702 --> 00:06:43.304]  Now, why is it important that we expose Obama?
[00:06:44.221 --> 00:06:47.424]  Well, I mean, people have drunk the Kool-Aid on this guy.
[00:06:47.424 --> 00:06:52.628]  It is from both sides, going over the acceptance speech, going over the night he won.
[00:06:52.628 --> 00:06:54.630]  I mean, people are in tears.
[00:06:54.630 --> 00:07:08.102]  I still remember, you know, I'm a New York guy, upstate, and walking in to get a coffee at my local convenience store, and I'm looking at the cover of the New York Post, I believe it was, and the clerk of the thing, she's like, isn't it great?
[00:07:08.102 --> 00:07:09.223]  It's the greatest thing ever!
[00:07:09.223 --> 00:07:09.723]  We did it!
[00:07:09.723 --> 00:07:10.144]  We won!
[00:07:11.047 --> 00:07:12.768]  And I'm like, no, it's not so great.
[00:07:12.768 --> 00:07:16.050]  It's actually totally and completely evil.
[00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.613]  And I explained to her, you know, they made this a big race issue, like this was a triumph for blacks.
[00:07:20.613 --> 00:07:28.177]  No, it would have been a triumph for African-Americans if Cynthia McKinney had actually won the Green Party candidate, the person that I voted for.
[00:07:28.177 --> 00:07:31.740]  Somebody who was actually genuine in her positions.
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.461]  So I explained to her, you know, that was a ploy.
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.520]  You know, that's something that we can all relate to.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.661]  I explained to her that... I mean, first of all, let's look at the guy.
[00:07:39.661 --> 00:07:47.642]  In 2004, when he gave the keynote speech out of nowhere at the Democratic National Convention, he wasn't even a senator yet.
[00:07:47.642 --> 00:07:50.063]  Let's explain this to the layman's out there.
[00:07:50.063 --> 00:07:52.263]  You get two senators a state, okay?
[00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:53.223]  That's two each.
[00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:54.984]  You get a hundred senators completely.
[00:07:54.984 --> 00:08:00.145]  Now, there are things called state senators, and you get a lot more of those based on your population in your state.
[00:08:00.145 --> 00:08:01.125]  Now, Barack Obama
[00:08:01.522 --> 00:08:05.685]  Was a state senator until 2004.
[00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:10.027]  He has little to no experience in anything!
[00:08:10.027 --> 00:08:11.388]  Yeah, is he well-educated?
[00:08:11.388 --> 00:08:11.789]  Of course.
[00:08:11.789 --> 00:08:14.530]  He's gone to all these different institutions.
[00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.792]  That's because he's been supported by insiders.
[00:08:16.792 --> 00:08:19.854]  This guy is an internationalist.
[00:08:19.854 --> 00:08:22.535]  The jury's still out on whether he was really born in Kenya or not.
[00:08:22.535 --> 00:08:24.557]  They never showed his birth certificate.
[00:08:24.557 --> 00:08:27.038]  Whether he was born in Hawaii or Kenya is almost a moot point.
[00:08:27.038 --> 00:08:28.239]  This guy is an internationalist.
[00:08:28.737 --> 00:08:30.598]  He's been to Africa many times.
[00:08:30.598 --> 00:08:36.920]  He went in front of a German audience, which I just... I can't get enough of that German audience speech.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:52.787]  If you've never seen it, Sky News, which is the Fox arm over in Europe, called it his New World Order speech, and he was calling for a New World Order, and he talks about global citizenship in that speech, and how we all need to come together, and this supposedly is the guy!
[00:08:52.787 --> 00:08:57.809]  You know, Farrakhan, who I had a little bit of respect for, you know, to bring
[00:08:58.604 --> 00:09:15.619]  people together basically he he was able to bring literally a million people down to dc twice with the million man march in the millions more march from their frustration and quite frankly a lot of the uh... bowtie type muslims out there are more uh... in the now and educated about current affairs
[00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.831]  I'd say 90% of the Christians out there.
[00:09:18.831 --> 00:09:22.572]  Sorry guys, not trying to bash you, but a lot of you guys are just total lemmings.
[00:09:22.572 --> 00:09:28.814]  You want to vote for McCain, vote for Bush, and think that they're Christian conservative, they care about you, and they're really Republicans.
[00:09:28.814 --> 00:09:29.875]  It's not the case.
[00:09:29.875 --> 00:09:37.998]  A lot of these guys know that the paradigm has shifted, but boy, they just could not... They couldn't pass up a black guy, let's be honest.
[00:09:37.998 --> 00:09:40.699]  And what really disturbed me is that Farrakhan
[00:09:41.561 --> 00:09:44.304]  We actually called him the Messiah on several occasions.
[00:09:44.304 --> 00:09:47.608]  We're going to play that and other clips for you after this.
[00:09:47.608 --> 00:09:48.529]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[00:09:57.774 --> 00:10:01.035]  Every 22 seconds, a violent crime is committed.
[00:10:01.035 --> 00:10:03.356]  Are you concerned about your personal safety?
[00:10:03.356 --> 00:10:06.977]  Why wait for something bad to happen when you can take action now?
[00:10:06.977 --> 00:10:07.917]  Be smart.
[00:10:07.917 --> 00:10:08.897]  Be safe.
[00:10:08.897 --> 00:10:11.078]  Trust Pepper Spray instead of your luck.

[00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:03.953]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:11:03.953 --> 00:11:11.677]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:11:12.057 --> 00:11:20.222]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit, we call the Federal Reserve Note, forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:11:20.222 --> 00:11:25.325]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:11:25.325 --> 00:11:30.528]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:11:30.528 --> 00:11:34.890]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:35.971]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:11:35.971 --> 00:11:39.993]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:11:40.453 --> 00:11:45.360]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.364]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:11:48.364 --> 00:11:50.146]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:11:50.146 --> 00:11:50.366]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:11:58.431 --> 00:12:13.309]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off, Ready Reserve Foods, in an effort to get as many Americans prepared for the promised changes of the new administration, and to help you and your family survive the global economic crash, Ready Reserve is offering the pre-inauguration special.
[00:12:13.929 --> 00:12:21.155]  Between now and January 20th, 2009, all food units U1 through U7 are being offered at wholesale prices.
[00:12:21.155 --> 00:12:22.996]  That's a 33% savings.
[00:12:22.996 --> 00:12:26.719]  A year's supply of meals starts as low as 73 cents per meal.
[00:12:26.719 --> 00:12:33.464]  Ready Reserve Food offers only the highest quality dehydrated food, packed in double enameled cans in an inert nitrogen atmosphere.
[00:12:38.166 --> 00:12:38.386]  I think so.
[00:12:57.051 --> 00:13:02.894]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[00:13:02.894 --> 00:13:08.318]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[00:13:08.318 --> 00:13:13.701]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[00:13:13.701 --> 00:13:17.263]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[00:13:17.543 --> 00:13:19.585]  Mental clarity and loss of weight.
[00:13:19.585 --> 00:13:22.527]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[00:13:22.527 --> 00:13:25.829]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:29.612]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[00:13:29.612 --> 00:13:34.436]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[00:13:34.436 --> 00:13:35.476]  Do your part.
[00:13:35.476 --> 00:13:38.098]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!

[00:13:57.512 --> 00:14:01.595]  Ay.
[00:14:01.595 --> 00:14:05.618]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:14:27.248 --> 00:14:30.309]  All right, folks, as I promised, we'll be taking your calls in the next segment.
[00:14:30.309 --> 00:14:32.149]  I hope they can be Obama-related.
[00:14:32.149 --> 00:14:33.169]  I am not Alex Jones.
[00:14:33.169 --> 00:14:39.291]  I'm Jason Bermas, a filmmaker who is behind Lose Change and now Fabled Enemies and hopefully many more to come.
[00:14:39.291 --> 00:14:46.052]  And I'll be sitting in for Alex all week if you listen over at InfoWars.com as well.
[00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:49.293]  And I really want to get into this Obama thing right now.
[00:14:50.743 --> 00:14:52.543]  Let's start playing some clips.
[00:14:52.543 --> 00:14:55.984]  Let's show how the media is kind of in on this as well.
[00:14:55.984 --> 00:15:01.826]  Let's show Colbert talking to John King about them getting Obama elected, and they obviously did.
[00:15:01.826 --> 00:15:04.947]  I mean, MSNBC was so unapologetic about it.
[00:15:04.947 --> 00:15:14.589]  They actually had commercials they were running with, you know, Olbermann, Scarborough, Chris Matthews all together, and experience the change.
[00:15:15.751 --> 00:15:18.895]  I mean, they're taking the guy's slogan before he's even elected!
[00:15:18.895 --> 00:15:24.061]  I mean, it is unbelievable to me, but we'll play this little Colbert clip and then we'll move on to yet another clip.
[00:15:24.061 --> 00:15:26.083]  Go ahead.
[00:15:26.083 --> 00:15:27.064]  Fight Club is excellent.
[00:15:27.064 --> 00:15:34.673]  First of all, I want to congratulate you and the rest of the media on getting Obama elected.
[00:15:34.673 --> 00:15:35.594]  You must feel very proud.
[00:15:43.347 --> 00:15:47.848]  If your point is that perhaps Barack Obama is in for a New World Order, I think you are correct.
[00:15:47.848 --> 00:15:48.549]  Oh!
[00:15:48.549 --> 00:15:50.169]  John King says New World Order.
[00:15:50.169 --> 00:15:50.889]  I just can't believe it.
[00:15:50.889 --> 00:15:51.970]  People criticize the press.
[00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:55.751]  Now, when I talk about the New World Order, I'm a kook.
[00:15:55.751 --> 00:15:56.851]  I'm a nutty guy.
[00:15:56.851 --> 00:16:04.473]  But when John King, who's been an anchor now for CNN for over 15 years, I believe, he says it.
[00:16:04.473 --> 00:16:05.354]  It's nonchalant.
[00:16:05.354 --> 00:16:06.234]  No one goes into it.
[00:16:06.234 --> 00:16:08.094]  No one really says anything about it.
[00:16:08.094 --> 00:16:09.815]  Oh yeah, I guess he is in for a New World Order.
[00:16:09.815 --> 00:16:10.295]  How about that?
[00:16:11.306 --> 00:16:25.017]  Now, that's on the, you know, obviously Colbert is satire, but to say that the media did not help him get elected, I think the only media outlet that was halfway polling for McCain was Fox.
[00:16:25.017 --> 00:16:29.080]  And even people like Shepard Smith did not seem like their heart was in it for McCain.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.682]  I mean, McCain was a puppet to lose, let's be honest.
[00:16:31.682 --> 00:16:40.469]  I mean, if they were really putting in a candidate that maybe had a shot on the Republican end, Mitt Romney comes to mind, somebody who was a little bit more well-spoken, young,
[00:16:41.164 --> 00:16:41.304]  I don't
[00:17:01.344 --> 00:17:09.669]  Every single news outlet I've watched from Anderson Cooper to, you know, it was on Brit Hume, of course they talked about it on Olbermann, Chris Matthews.
[00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:13.131]  So, he pretty much knew he was going to win from May on.
[00:17:13.131 --> 00:17:13.911]  Now, why is that?
[00:17:13.911 --> 00:17:18.594]  Well, magically, Obama attended the Bilderberg Conference.
[00:17:18.594 --> 00:17:27.079]  Now, he never confirmed that, but after, I mean, literally right after Hillary conceded, he and Hillary both disappeared.
[00:17:27.825 --> 00:17:29.166]  into Washington DC.
[00:17:29.166 --> 00:17:33.049]  Now, Obama actually tricked the press corps.
[00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:34.190]  He tricked the press corps.
[00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:42.617]  He actually told the press corps what he was going to do, but then he tricked them by letting them think that he was going to be on the plane when they left Dulles Airport.
[00:17:42.617 --> 00:17:51.504]  If you watch the interview on the plane prior to him tricking them, he says that he's going to meet with Senator Clinton in private without any press or surrogates.
[00:17:51.963 --> 00:17:55.266]  So in other words, none of his Chief of Staff are going to be there, and there's going to be no press there.
[00:17:55.266 --> 00:17:59.029]  But if you think it's a one-on-one meeting, you are incorrect.
[00:17:59.029 --> 00:18:01.532]  So later on, he escapes.
[00:18:01.532 --> 00:18:07.357]  His press secretary, I believe at the time, Gibbs, or, you know, the equivalent, Chief of Staff or whatever, Gibbs,
[00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:08.905]  It's very uneasy.
[00:18:08.905 --> 00:18:10.826]  He says it's an undisclosed location.
[00:18:10.826 --> 00:18:11.986]  He won't give it up.
[00:18:11.986 --> 00:18:17.009]  Now, Anderson Cooper on CNN is the first to start reporting it, and they start reporting that it's at Clinton's home.
[00:18:17.009 --> 00:18:18.090]  Oh, it's in her D.C.
[00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:18.430]  home.
[00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:19.331]  Isn't that nice?
[00:18:19.331 --> 00:18:20.732]  There's a couple suburbans outside.
[00:18:20.732 --> 00:18:22.513]  The media starts to go there.
[00:18:22.513 --> 00:18:24.914]  Well, lo and behold, it's not at Clinton's home.
[00:18:24.914 --> 00:18:26.675]  So where is it?
[00:18:26.675 --> 00:18:33.299]  Well, the Bilderberg meeting is going on about 10 miles down the road with the likes of Condoleezza Rice, Alan Greenspan,
[00:18:34.379 --> 00:18:36.481]  Let's see, David Rockefeller was there this year.
[00:18:36.481 --> 00:18:39.422]  You can actually get the Bilderberg List online.
[00:18:39.422 --> 00:18:41.163]  They actually published it this year.
[00:18:41.163 --> 00:18:44.905]  It's the biggest meeting you've never heard about.
[00:18:44.905 --> 00:18:55.732]  And, I mean, it's 144 of the top people in economics, in foreign policy, in domestic policy, in the world.
[00:18:55.732 --> 00:19:00.855]  Now, the cover story after that, after they got caught that they weren't in Clinton's home, was that Dianne Feinstein,
[00:19:01.445 --> 00:19:04.488]  You know, one of these insiders held the meeting at her house.
[00:19:04.488 --> 00:19:05.389]  Total bull.
[00:19:05.389 --> 00:19:06.910]  They both went to the meeting.
[00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:13.516]  They established that Obama was not only going to win, but they probably talked about where Hillary Clinton fit in.
[00:19:13.516 --> 00:19:17.440]  A lot of people at the time thought that she would be the Vice President.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.401]  I was one of those people.
[00:19:18.401 --> 00:19:23.025]  I thought that an Obama-Hillary Clinton ticket would be what they wanted to give the people.
[00:19:23.025 --> 00:19:24.167]  I was wrong.
[00:19:24.167 --> 00:19:26.649]  Instead, they chose another insider, Biden.
[00:19:27.324 --> 00:19:29.266]  Who is a pretty likable guy.
[00:19:29.266 --> 00:19:35.491]  I mean, he cracked a pretty funny joke at Kucinich about his wife being hot, and everybody can relate to that, right?
[00:19:35.491 --> 00:19:40.495]  But then, you have Clinton getting the spot of Secretary of State.
[00:19:40.495 --> 00:19:50.824]  And a couple of other insiders, amazingly, you know, as this quote-unquote secret meeting was going on, called it, said that that's what they were really discussing, was what her role in the administration would be, and now we know that role.
[00:19:51.878 --> 00:19:59.240]  So, they go and they meet with the likes of these internationalists, and one of those internationalists happens to be Henry Kissinger.
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.801]  And that brings us to our next clip.
[00:20:01.801 --> 00:20:12.624]  Kissinger, a few weeks ago on CNBC, it might not even be a few weeks ago, it might have been a couple weeks ago or a week ago, I'm not sure what the date of the clip is, but on the floor they ask Mr. Kissinger
[00:20:13.021 --> 00:20:24.845]  This, you know, political strategist, this behind-the-scenes guy that has really, I mean, he was an advisor to Bush, behind the scenes, on, right after 9-11, on the war in Iraq, and it all came out.
[00:20:24.845 --> 00:20:34.388]  I mean, they wanted to appoint Kissinger as the head of the 9-11 Commission, but so many people were outraged from his international war crimes, overthrowing Allende and Chile.
[00:20:34.673 --> 00:20:39.417]  The President-elect is coming into office at the moment when there are upheavals in many parts of the world simultaneously.
[00:20:39.417 --> 00:20:40.457]  We have India, Pakistan, the U.S.,
[00:21:04.202 --> 00:21:05.763]  He added movement.
[00:21:05.763 --> 00:21:09.864]  So he can't really say that it's one problem, that it's the most important one.
[00:21:09.864 --> 00:21:20.887]  But he can give a new impetus to American foreign policy partly because the reception of him is so extraordinary around the world.
[00:21:20.887 --> 00:21:30.290]  I think his task will be to develop an overall strategy for America in this period when really a new world order can be created.
[00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:31.771]  It's a great opportunity.
[00:21:31.771 --> 00:21:32.351]  It isn't such
[00:21:33.744 --> 00:21:36.366]  Oh, it's a great opportunity for a New World Order.
[00:21:36.366 --> 00:21:37.567]  Isn't that lovely?
[00:21:37.567 --> 00:21:40.969]  You know, Kissinger's been pushing this stuff since the 70s.
[00:21:40.969 --> 00:21:45.072]  I mean, I can't tell you how many clips where Kissinger is talking about the New World Order.
[00:21:45.072 --> 00:21:52.777]  See, a lot of people think, oh, well, isn't the New World Order just a term that Daddy Bush used a couple times in the State of the Union address?
[00:21:52.777 --> 00:21:54.218]  Well, no, he used those terms.
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:22:01.561]  He was just a front man for a larger organization of people, just like Kissinger is just a front man.
[00:22:01.561 --> 00:22:05.282]  This is more than just an idea of global government.
[00:22:05.282 --> 00:22:12.783]  This is something that has been on the table with elitists and intellectuals for hundreds of years.
[00:22:12.783 --> 00:22:13.223]  H.G.
[00:22:13.223 --> 00:22:14.503]  Wells.
[00:22:14.503 --> 00:22:14.863]  H.G.
[00:22:14.863 --> 00:22:18.104]  Wells wrote a book called The New World Order.
[00:22:18.104 --> 00:22:23.025]  Hitler talked about a new world order.
[00:22:23.025 --> 00:22:24.305]  It is not a coincidence
[00:22:24.758 --> 00:22:29.942]  That this term is still being used and that it is still trying to be achieved.
[00:22:29.942 --> 00:22:32.424]  Global government, I mean, that's what this bailout is about.
[00:22:32.424 --> 00:22:39.128]  It's about giving all of your assets and your financial institutions to international bankers.
[00:22:39.128 --> 00:22:40.529]  So it's time to wake up, folks.
[00:22:40.529 --> 00:22:41.530]  Infowars.com.
[00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.291]  We'll be back after this to take your calls.
[00:22:43.291 --> 00:22:44.612]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:22:44.612 --> 00:22:45.333]  I'm Jason Vermas.
[00:22:57.870 --> 00:22:59.871]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:22:59.871 --> 00:23:06.813]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:23:06.813 --> 00:23:15.216]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:23:15.216 --> 00:23:20.938]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:23:21.338 --> 00:23:22.960]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.263]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:23:25.263 --> 00:23:29.669]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:31.891]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:23:31.891 --> 00:23:39.661]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.021]  Break the law and you're caught on film.
[00:24:01.021 --> 00:24:06.044]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with a reflective spray.
[00:24:06.044 --> 00:24:07.985]  The reflection blinded our camera.
[00:24:07.985 --> 00:24:09.325]  We are under the microscope.
[00:24:09.325 --> 00:24:13.347]  Red light cameras and speed cameras are in place to make money, not for your safety.
[00:24:13.347 --> 00:24:16.989]  But you don't have to be defenseless against these unconstitutional devices.
[00:24:16.989 --> 00:24:20.270]  Have a fighting chance with SprayYourPlate.com's Photoblocker.
[00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:26.473]  When properly applied, this revolutionary product has proven itself to be the most effective device available against traffic cameras.
[00:24:26.473 --> 00:24:28.114]  Invisible to the naked eye, your license
[00:24:28.154 --> 00:24:28.594]  I think so.
[00:24:59.019 --> 00:24:59.880]  Less is more.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:04.524]  I want you to think of Life Change T as, well, a 2008 Ferrari 612.
[00:25:04.524 --> 00:25:10.548]  The Ferrari 612 is a 2-door, 4-passenger luxury car that gives an exploding 540 horsepower through its 6-liter V12.
[00:25:10.548 --> 00:25:13.431]  It has a top speed of 199 miles per hour and can accelerate 0-60 in about 4 seconds.
[00:25:18.655 --> 00:25:25.760]  Life Change Tea will accelerate your life into feeling more energy, losing weight, and cleansing toxins out of your body so you'll live longer.
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:26.541]  And guess what?
[00:25:26.541 --> 00:25:30.664]  You can accelerate your life without a Ferrari 612 sticker price of $318,000.
[00:25:30.664 --> 00:25:37.169]  You can buy Green Tea for less, but unfortunately, it's just another daily driver with no performance.
[00:25:37.369 --> 00:25:40.612]  So for just about a dollar a day, you can drive the Ferrari of T's.
[00:25:40.612 --> 00:25:42.213]  Don't be fooled by size.
[00:25:42.213 --> 00:25:44.935]  Check our website out at GetTheTee.com.
[00:25:44.935 --> 00:25:47.037]  That's GetTheTee.com.
[00:25:47.037 --> 00:25:47.918]  Or you can call us at 928-308-0408.
[00:25:47.918 --> 00:25:48.659]  Again, that's 928-308-0408.
[00:25:48.659 --> 00:25:49.659]  Remember, life changed tee.
[00:25:49.659 --> 00:25:50.260]  Less is more.
[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:50.480]  Thank you.
[00:25:57.446 --> 00:26:03.469]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[00:26:03.469 --> 00:26:07.791]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[00:26:07.791 --> 00:26:15.475]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[00:26:15.475 --> 00:26:16.216]  The solution?
[00:26:16.216 --> 00:26:20.178]  Detoxification integrated with Electro Chi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[00:26:20.438 --> 00:26:29.527]  The LectroChi Premier Energy Foot Spa helps to aid in cleansing the body of harmful toxins while energizing and oxygenating your entire body at the cellular level.
[00:26:29.527 --> 00:26:37.675]  Detoxification works with the LectroChi Premier Energy Foot Spa because it addresses the needs of individual cells, the building blocks of human life.
[00:26:37.675 --> 00:26:42.159]  For mental clarity, restored vitality, a stronger immune system, clear skin,
[00:26:42.419 --> 00:26:43.879]  You're locked into the Alex Jones Show!
[00:27:16.076 --> 00:27:17.957]  Alright, folks, we're back.
[00:27:17.957 --> 00:27:21.920]  Now, before we go to calls, I want to play two more big clips.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.221]  Um, actually, three more big clips.
[00:27:24.221 --> 00:27:31.165]  We're talking Obama, and I really want people to understand that he has been hyped as the next coming.
[00:27:31.165 --> 00:27:42.492]  But he, again, is looking to create a world order, and I'm going to have to apologize in advance for the world order clip, because the guy repeats it a couple times, and we really don't want to edit it out, so, you know, hopefully you'll get what he's saying there.
[00:27:42.492 --> 00:27:44.954]  He's talking about creating a world order.
[00:27:45.768 --> 00:27:51.331]  But before that, I want you to hear Farrakhan actually call him the Messiah.
[00:27:51.331 --> 00:27:56.374]  We're going to play those clips and then a third clip of how he might be able to build this world order.
[00:27:56.374 --> 00:28:01.056]  So let's play the Messiah clip and then the Obama world order clip.
[00:28:01.056 --> 00:28:01.456]  Let's do it.
[00:28:01.456 --> 00:28:10.321]  That God is going to use to bring about universal change.
[00:28:10.321 --> 00:28:11.842]  And that is why Barack
[00:28:13.166 --> 00:28:27.134]  He has captured the youth and he has involved young people in a political process that they didn't care anything about.
[00:28:27.134 --> 00:28:29.875]  That's a sign.
[00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:35.679]  When the Messiah speaks, the youth will hear.
[00:28:42.209 --> 00:28:44.130]  Oh my God, the Messiah speaks.
[00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:45.191]  He calls him the Messiah.
[00:28:45.191 --> 00:28:47.613]  He is the Messiah.
[00:28:47.613 --> 00:28:58.399]  No, he's a regular human being who was put forth by internationalists, mostly the banking elite, as the new front man for globalization.
[00:28:58.399 --> 00:29:02.562]  Let's play the clip of him on Letterman talking about building a world order.
[00:29:03.747 --> 00:29:14.613]  The way we're going to win over the long term is not just militarily, we've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like.
[00:29:14.613 --> 00:29:17.055]  Alright, so how do you create a world order?
[00:29:17.055 --> 00:29:25.720]  Well, there's something called the Hegelian dialectic that is used again and again and again by those who want to get their agendas passed through.
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:31.663]  What they do is they create a crisis and then they offer you two solutions which are similar, both of which
[00:29:32.671 --> 00:29:36.253]  I would start with talking to the American people and talking to the world.
[00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:00.730]  What?!
[00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:01.110]  Play it again.
[00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.571]  Play it again.
[00:30:01.571 --> 00:30:02.271]  We gotta play it again.
[00:30:02.271 --> 00:30:02.911]  I mean, I can't... Listen.
[00:30:19.241 --> 00:30:23.962]  How does he know there's going to be a crisis that we don't even know about on the 21st or 22nd?
[00:30:23.962 --> 00:30:31.464]  That's not like saying there's going to be a crisis throughout the presidency, the Middle East is out of control, we're going to have to contain it in the next few months.
[00:30:31.464 --> 00:30:32.604]  No, he calls the date.
[00:30:32.604 --> 00:30:33.164]  Why is that?
[00:30:33.164 --> 00:30:34.805]  Let's play it.
[00:30:34.805 --> 00:30:45.067]  I would start with talking to the American people and talking to the world and conveying a new image of American leadership, a new image of America's role in the world.
[00:30:45.999 --> 00:30:53.441]  The problem will always be there and there's going to be a crisis come along on the 21st or 22nd of January that we don't even know about right now.
[00:30:53.441 --> 00:30:54.201]  All right.
[00:30:54.201 --> 00:30:57.362]  So again, you know, why is he calling this date?
[00:30:57.362 --> 00:30:58.542]  God forbid he's right.
[00:30:58.542 --> 00:31:03.003]  Or God forbid something happens a week later, you know, or a month later.
[00:31:03.003 --> 00:31:08.165]  You know, I can only assume that this is going to be an announcement of financial doom.
[00:31:08.165 --> 00:31:12.846]  It's here, folks, that $700 billion bailout that the media is still saying, oh, they've only given away
[00:31:13.346 --> 00:31:14.487]  $350 billion.
[00:31:14.487 --> 00:31:20.029]  I've noticed Barney Frank on TV lying and saying the next $350 billion has to go for something else.
[00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:22.850]  No, they gave them over $8 trillion.
[00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:24.891]  Look it up in Bloomberg, okay?
[00:31:24.891 --> 00:31:26.031]  $8 trillion.
[00:31:26.031 --> 00:31:26.431]  Can you even?
[00:31:26.431 --> 00:31:29.252]  $8 trillion, folks.
[00:31:29.252 --> 00:31:29.712]  And guess what?
[00:31:29.712 --> 00:31:31.053]  You're not going to get any of it.
[00:31:31.053 --> 00:31:33.554]  They're not going to loan you money for a home.
[00:31:33.554 --> 00:31:35.395]  Your banks are still going to go under.
[00:31:35.395 --> 00:31:41.277]  The same criminals are just going to take it and reinvest it in infrastructure and offshore banking accounts, and they're going to keep it.
[00:31:41.917 --> 00:31:43.938]  Alright, I've ranted long enough.
[00:31:43.938 --> 00:31:46.279]  It is time to do what I said I would do, and take calls.
[00:31:46.279 --> 00:31:48.440]  Let's go to our first caller, Jason.
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.942]  Jason, what's on your mind?
[00:31:51.942 --> 00:31:54.023]  Still with us, Jason?
[00:31:54.023 --> 00:31:55.784]  Alright, uh, Pat's on air.
[00:31:55.784 --> 00:31:57.805]  Let's go with Pat.
[00:31:57.805 --> 00:31:58.406]  Hello!
[00:31:58.406 --> 00:31:59.546]  How you doing, Pat?
[00:31:59.546 --> 00:32:03.868]  Hi, um, yeah, I, um, there are two things I want to say.
[00:32:03.868 --> 00:32:08.771]  First of all, Farrakhan, I think he may not have been really referring to Obama as the Messiah.
[00:32:09.682 --> 00:32:13.584]  But, um, you know, Allah, that's his messiah.
[00:32:13.584 --> 00:32:14.165]  I don't know.
[00:32:14.165 --> 00:32:20.068]  He calls him... They didn't play the end of the clip, but he literally calls Obama the messiah.
[00:32:20.068 --> 00:32:21.509]  I mean, it's pretty outrageous.
[00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:24.891]  Look, again, I like some of the things the Farrakhan's done for civil rights.
[00:32:24.891 --> 00:32:27.773]  I like how he's able to organize that many people.
[00:32:27.773 --> 00:32:31.295]  But what's really upsetting is that he's behind this guy.
[00:32:31.295 --> 00:32:32.856]  Again, think about it.
[00:32:32.856 --> 00:32:34.737]  This is a guy who was a state senator.
[00:32:35.217 --> 00:32:35.497]  I agree.
[00:32:35.497 --> 00:32:36.977]  What's your second point, ma'am?
[00:33:00.778 --> 00:33:12.561]  A few weeks ago, Alex and one of the experts were talking about economics, and they were saying that they were speculating what the crisis might be after his immediate inauguration.
[00:33:12.561 --> 00:33:14.602]  And he mentioned the Bankers' Holiday.
[00:33:14.602 --> 00:33:25.345]  A man, my brother, was talking, he was saying that back in FDR day, they declared Bankers' Holiday, but the people, when they declared it, the people never got their money back.
[00:33:25.345 --> 00:33:28.506]  And that's my, that's what I want you guys to clarify, if you can.
[00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:33.471]  Does bank holiday mean that they were free to temporarily or will it be indefinitely?
[00:33:33.471 --> 00:33:35.672]  Will you never get your money?
[00:33:35.672 --> 00:33:40.013]  It could be restructured where if you have debt they're gonna make you pay it back.
[00:33:40.013 --> 00:33:44.914]  Well it could be restructured so if you have debt they'll still make you pay it back but they won't be liable for what's in the bank.
[00:33:44.914 --> 00:33:47.815]  I mean banks are only insured for a hundred thousand dollars anyway.
[00:33:47.815 --> 00:33:56.958]  So all these people that are upper to middle class that have actually saved money, anything over a hundred grand, they'll take off the top and then through, you know, backtalk and
[00:33:57.518 --> 00:34:00.981]  You know, simple legislation or possibly executive orders.
[00:34:00.981 --> 00:34:07.085]  Again, a lot of people are saying that Obama's camp is going to come with these executive orders out of the gate in the first couple days.
[00:34:07.085 --> 00:34:08.627]  That could be what we see.
[00:34:08.627 --> 00:34:15.132]  And it could be a new shutdown, where they literally take everything and are totally not liable for any of it.
[00:34:15.132 --> 00:34:18.394]  I mean, God knows what these guys are going to do.
[00:34:18.394 --> 00:34:25.980]  I'd point to G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island, where literally, I think the second chapter is, the name of the game is bailout.
[00:34:26.541 --> 00:34:29.545]  And it's very alarming that when they restructured
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:34.101]  Everything for the Federal Reserve, they used a bailout to do so.
[00:34:34.101 --> 00:34:35.942]  So what are they restructuring it for now?
[00:34:35.942 --> 00:34:41.563]  It might be the creation of, you know, what they want, a more internationally controlled bank.
[00:34:41.563 --> 00:34:45.505]  So will they take people's money and never give it back?
[00:34:45.505 --> 00:34:49.146]  I'm in Austin, and they were talking about the tax returns.
[00:34:49.146 --> 00:34:58.169]  In other words, if the government owes you money on your tax returns, giving the people IOUs, and then saying that those IOUs would not even be able, you couldn't say you had an IOU for
[00:34:59.749 --> 00:35:02.932]  Uh, you know, they overcharged you and your check was gonna be $2,000.
[00:35:02.932 --> 00:35:04.533]  They give you the IOU for $2,000.
[00:35:04.533 --> 00:35:07.755]  Now, they still haven't paid you next year for your taxes.
[00:35:07.755 --> 00:35:12.419]  You can't use that money towards your taxes that you may owe the next year.
[00:35:12.419 --> 00:35:18.704]  So that sounds like a total scam to me, where they're just gonna take your tax money, and an exorbitant amount of your tax money, and never return it.
[00:35:18.704 --> 00:35:20.025]  Thank you for the call, Pat.
[00:35:20.025 --> 00:35:21.486]  I hope I was insightful.
[00:35:21.486 --> 00:35:24.288]  Alright, um, jeez.
[00:35:24.288 --> 00:35:27.190]  Let's, uh, let's go to the next caller, Captain Kook.
[00:35:28.504 --> 00:35:29.725]  Geez.
[00:35:29.725 --> 00:35:31.265]  Yes, Captain Kook.
[00:35:31.265 --> 00:35:32.886]  How you doing, Jason?
[00:35:32.886 --> 00:35:35.587]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:35:35.587 --> 00:35:40.450]  Democrats and Republicans are two wings on the same bird flying in the wrong direction.
[00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:41.670]  And you're absolutely right.
[00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:52.255]  As a Christian minister, sir, I would have to say that the church is a whole lot less insightful than some of the other groups, and that's kind of a sad coming
[00:35:53.616 --> 00:35:59.863]  Alright, I gotta let you go just because, you know, I got a phone going on in the background and that's on your end, but let me speak to that.
[00:35:59.863 --> 00:36:10.736]  First of all, the originators of this movement, many of them were Christian conservatives and I thank them for that, and many of the members of this movement still are Christian conservatives, and before the internet age,
[00:36:11.681 --> 00:36:22.428]  They took the mantle by showing videos such as, you know, John Birch Society videos or Alex Jones videos in their ministries and churches and waking other people up.
[00:36:22.428 --> 00:36:25.490]  I don't think the problem itself is Christianity.
[00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:26.891]  I happen to think it's a great religion.
[00:36:26.891 --> 00:36:28.472]  It teaches a lot of great morals.
[00:36:28.472 --> 00:36:32.175]  However, it has been completely hijacked.
[00:36:32.175 --> 00:36:40.861]  Completely hijacked by people like Pat Robertson, the 700 Club, Rush Limbaugh, and these people that are fronts for the internationalists.
[00:36:41.792 --> 00:36:42.453]  So we're going to come back.
[00:36:42.453 --> 00:36:43.794]  We're going to take more calls.
[00:36:43.794 --> 00:36:44.995]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:36:44.995 --> 00:36:45.895]  I am Jason Bermas.
[00:36:45.895 --> 00:36:46.916]  Infowars.com.
[00:36:46.916 --> 00:36:47.957]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:36:57.478 --> 00:37:00.980]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:02.900]  Now, going green can save money.
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:08.463]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[00:37:08.463 --> 00:37:16.486]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[00:37:16.486 --> 00:37:25.790]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives.
[00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.530]  That's right.
[00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:56.711]  We're good to go.
[00:38:14.008 --> 00:38:22.433]  Individual retirement accounts and most 401Ks, 403Bs, SEFs and other retirement plans can be rolled over into self-directed accounts using gold and silver.
[00:38:22.433 --> 00:38:27.456]  There are definitely some do's and don'ts with this rollover process and that's where Midas Resources comes in.
[00:38:27.456 --> 00:38:33.659]  Call us at 1-866-323-5665 and we can help you with this process.
[00:38:33.659 --> 00:38:39.102]  History has shown that metals will maintain your buying power even if other financial assets are failing.
[00:38:39.102 --> 00:38:43.585]  It's not a question of if you'll need precious metals in your portfolio, it's a question of when.
[00:38:44.065 --> 00:38:49.375]  So whether you're planning for an economic rainy day or a Category 5 hurricane, the solution is the same.
[00:38:49.375 --> 00:38:50.236]  Call us today at 1-866-323-5665.

[00:38:57.663 --> 00:39:01.105]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:39:01.105 --> 00:39:04.907]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:39:04.907 --> 00:39:11.211]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[00:39:11.211 --> 00:39:15.854]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:39:15.854 --> 00:39:21.877]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:39:21.877 --> 00:39:25.279]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:39:25.279 --> 00:39:25.960]  Run sump pumps.
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:29.921]  Shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[00:39:29.921 --> 00:39:36.163]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:39:36.163 --> 00:39:41.124]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready with the solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:39:41.124 --> 00:39:45.466]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.

[00:39:49.007 --> 00:39:49.327]  Don't wait.
[00:39:56.429 --> 00:39:57.570]  Call today!
[00:39:57.570 --> 00:40:08.155]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:40:08.155 --> 00:40:09.576]  Garden in a Can!
[00:40:09.576 --> 00:40:13.718]  Garden in a Can is your source for premium, long-term, storable seeds.
[00:40:13.718 --> 00:40:15.719]  Garden in a Can is ready when you are.
[00:40:15.719 --> 00:40:18.500]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:24.343]  There are 16 large, hermetically sealed, non-hybrid, open-pollinated packets of seeds, along with detailed planting

[00:41:02.437 --> 00:41:07.903]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:41:07.903 --> 00:41:09.825]  Raging for the truth.
[00:41:09.825 --> 00:41:11.867]  Exposing corruption.
[00:41:11.867 --> 00:41:15.550]  Dismantling the false left-right paradigm.
[00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:17.092]  He's Alex Jones.
[00:41:18.684 --> 00:41:20.065]  Alright, folks, we are back.
[00:41:20.065 --> 00:41:21.226]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:41:21.226 --> 00:41:21.907]  I'm sitting in.
[00:41:21.907 --> 00:41:23.709]  I am Jason Bermas, a filmmaker.
[00:41:23.709 --> 00:41:41.685]  You can get my films, Fabled Enemies, Loose Change, Final Cut, over at InfoWars.com, as well as Alex's films, such as Endgame, American Dictators, which I think is a very important and under-seen film, 9-11 Chronicles, Truth Rising, a great film, Martial Law, really the list goes on.
[00:41:41.685 --> 00:41:44.948]  And he carries a lot of other great books and videos that are not his own.
[00:41:45.948 --> 00:41:49.151]  So please go to Infowars.com and support us.
[00:41:49.151 --> 00:41:51.573]  And remember folks, I mean, we give away a lot here.
[00:41:51.573 --> 00:41:54.075]  You know, you can listen to the show every day for free.
[00:41:54.075 --> 00:41:55.617]  We give away the free podcast.
[00:41:55.617 --> 00:41:58.239]  All the films are on Google Video.
[00:41:58.239 --> 00:42:03.363]  I mean, we're trying to reach out to as many people as possible and that's why this show isn't about the left or right.
[00:42:03.363 --> 00:42:05.505]  It's about right and wrong.
[00:42:05.505 --> 00:42:10.670]  And that's why we're going after Obama the same way that we went after the Bush administration.
[00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:12.852]  Because people like Zygmunt Brzezinski
[00:42:13.237 --> 00:42:19.702]  Who are on his campaign team are the same people that created Al-Qaeda and brag about it in books like the Grand Chess Board.
[00:42:19.702 --> 00:42:28.648]  You know, this is a Trilateral Commission guy that's been around forever, an advisor to Carter, um, you know, I mean, he's been at National Security Council.
[00:42:28.648 --> 00:42:32.471]  Talk about, talk about an insider among insiders.
[00:42:32.471 --> 00:42:40.437]  I mean, I think, uh, you know, the best analogy I've ever seen is that this guy is like something out of a Bond film.
[00:42:40.437 --> 00:42:42.158]  He's like, yes, well,
[00:42:42.642 --> 00:42:54.009]  You know, I do not know if this will enhance the conspiracy or not, but obviously there are always over-the-table and under-the-table dealings.
[00:42:54.009 --> 00:42:58.091]  But the Bilderberg Group and the Trilateral Commission are over-the-table, so obviously nothing is going on.
[00:42:58.091 --> 00:42:58.591]  Really?
[00:42:58.591 --> 00:43:08.457]  Most people don't know about the Bilderberg Group, Mr. Brzezinski, because it's not reported on by your precious Washington Times and your New York Times and your
[00:43:09.451 --> 00:43:11.191]  You know, Chicago Tribune.
[00:43:11.191 --> 00:43:11.911]  Why is that?
[00:43:11.911 --> 00:43:17.993]  Or when it is reported, it's reported as a conspiracy theory and the kooks have something else to cling on to.
[00:43:17.993 --> 00:43:29.495]  Well, we need to get past that childlike mentality and expose it for what it really is, an arm of the super elite making decisions without us.
[00:43:29.495 --> 00:43:36.096]  And having their little puppets come and meet with them so they can instruct them how the rest of it will go.
[00:43:36.096 --> 00:43:37.076]  Just like when Obama
[00:43:37.938 --> 00:43:39.838]  and Hillary met them this year.
[00:43:39.838 --> 00:43:40.598]  Look into it, guys.
[00:43:40.598 --> 00:43:43.679]  I mean, it's blatantly obvious to anybody with half a brain.
[00:43:43.679 --> 00:43:45.579]  All right, let's continue with the calls.
[00:43:45.579 --> 00:43:47.980]  Let's go to Jason.
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:51.700]  Jason, are you with us?
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:52.801]  I'm sorry, we'll go to Anthony.
[00:43:52.801 --> 00:43:54.761]  Anthony, are you with us?
[00:43:54.761 --> 00:43:55.841]  Hello, Jason?
[00:43:55.841 --> 00:43:57.181]  Yes, sir.
[00:43:57.181 --> 00:43:59.682]  Hi, this is Anthony Ilona.
[00:43:59.682 --> 00:44:06.023]  I just wanted to, first of all, thank you for all the documentaries you put out on the loose change product.
[00:44:07.563 --> 00:44:12.846]  The other ones you were involved with, the 9-11 Chronicles, you know, excellent.
[00:44:12.846 --> 00:44:14.326]  And also big up to Alex Jones.
[00:44:14.326 --> 00:44:15.267]  He's been an excellent documentary.
[00:44:15.267 --> 00:44:17.288]  He's an asset to this country, obviously.
[00:44:17.288 --> 00:44:19.889]  Just a little wonder about the Cynthia McKinney incident.
[00:44:19.889 --> 00:44:22.210]  As you know, Cynthia McKinney has been in the news recently.
[00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:24.611]  She's been hit by a boat from Israel.
[00:44:24.611 --> 00:44:25.772]  Well, why don't you tell people about that?
[00:44:25.772 --> 00:44:32.215]  Because a lot of people don't understand that McKinney was on a diplomatic mission to really just help and aid the Palestinians.
[00:44:32.215 --> 00:44:32.815]  And what happened?
[00:44:33.755 --> 00:44:37.679]  Right, and she gets attacked just like anybody that's really trying to make a positive change.
[00:44:37.679 --> 00:44:41.844]  They get attacked by, of course, the establishment that doesn't want a positive change.
[00:44:41.844 --> 00:44:44.566]  They want their change to take place.
[00:44:44.566 --> 00:44:51.854]  But I was wondering, you know, during Cynthia McKinney's presidential election, I was just wondering, you know, Alex Jones' point of view on that, because I really didn't hear a lot.
[00:44:52.746 --> 00:44:53.687]  Sure.
[00:44:53.687 --> 00:44:55.808]  You know, Jones, probably.
[00:44:55.808 --> 00:44:57.088]  I don't know who he voted for.
[00:44:57.088 --> 00:45:03.592]  I don't want to get into it, but there was a few candidates out there that kind of support the Patriot movement.
[00:45:03.592 --> 00:45:08.374]  Unfortunately for him, Cynthia McKinney is too much of a gun grabber in his opinion.
[00:45:08.374 --> 00:45:15.918]  I feel like she does have that blind spot, but overall I was willing to give her my vote instead of, say, maybe a Chuck Baldwin.
[00:45:16.298 --> 00:45:19.020]  Who is a little bit more towards the religious right.
[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:21.781]  Maybe Jones voted for him, I don't know.
[00:45:21.781 --> 00:45:27.325]  Bob Barr, who again is a little more towards the religious right, possibly voted for him.
[00:45:27.325 --> 00:45:28.525]  I'm not quite sure.
[00:45:28.525 --> 00:45:31.267]  You know, he likes Cynthia McKinney on a lot of the issues.
[00:45:31.267 --> 00:45:34.089]  I really wish that Ron Paul had run as independent.
[00:45:34.089 --> 00:45:36.410]  I think a Ron Paul-McKinney ticket would have been perfect.
[00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:44.415]  I mean, Ron Paul went in front of the House this week and explained to Congress how Israel funded and created Hamas.
[00:45:44.415 --> 00:45:44.635]  I mean,
[00:45:45.319 --> 00:45:48.221]  It doesn't get much more truth-telling than that, you know.
[00:45:48.221 --> 00:45:54.364]  And, you know, we didn't really tell you, but the way that McKinney was attacked on this mission is she was rammed with an Israeli boat.
[00:45:54.364 --> 00:45:59.607]  And, you know, whether they tried not to try to sink her, they definitely tried to thwart her mission.
[00:45:59.607 --> 00:46:01.288]  So I'm a big fan of McKinney.
[00:46:01.288 --> 00:46:02.488]  I hope that she continues on.
[00:46:02.488 --> 00:46:07.391]  I hope that she maybe takes a seat in Congress or a state Senate spot somewhere down the line.
[00:46:07.391 --> 00:46:10.353]  But I don't think that Jones was willing to give her his vote.
[00:46:10.353 --> 00:46:12.334]  But he's a huge supporter of her ideas.
[00:46:13.021 --> 00:46:15.962]  Yeah, the Senator McKinney-Ron Paul vote would be a blessing.
[00:46:15.962 --> 00:46:20.082]  I think that would have a bigger movement than Obama any day, hands down.
[00:46:20.082 --> 00:46:24.643]  I think it would have been a lot harder to suppress the way that they suppressed the Ron Paul movement.
[00:46:24.643 --> 00:46:33.965]  I mean, when you saw those primaries, and I thank you for the call, you saw literally, you know, dozens and then hundreds and then thousands of Ron Paul supporters showing up.
[00:46:33.965 --> 00:46:37.286]  I mean, Ron Paul was able to hold his own convention.
[00:46:38.587 --> 00:46:41.609]  You know, as the Republicans held theirs.
[00:46:41.609 --> 00:46:42.910]  I mean, what does that say?
[00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:45.831]  Or was that... I think it might have actually been during the Democratic National Convention.
[00:46:45.831 --> 00:46:47.152]  But he held his own convention.
[00:46:47.152 --> 00:46:48.713]  He had thousands of people show up.
[00:46:48.713 --> 00:46:50.734]  He had speakers like Jesse Mentera.
[00:46:50.734 --> 00:46:57.638]  He's still on the House floor defending the Constitution and Bill of Rights and telling the truth.
[00:46:57.638 --> 00:47:06.303]  Again, you know, you didn't see Ron Paul on CNN being covered, you know, talking about how Israel funded and created Hamas to be the enemy.
[00:47:06.966 --> 00:47:15.475]  Okay, you only saw it on C-SPAN Live once, and maybe if you're savvy with a computer, you can pull it up on YouTube, and we may do that in the next hour.
[00:47:15.475 --> 00:47:17.517]  Alright, let's jump to Tony.
[00:47:17.517 --> 00:47:19.359]  He's got something to say about Barack.
[00:47:19.359 --> 00:47:19.880]  Tony, what's up?
[00:47:21.125 --> 00:47:23.306]  Thank you, Alex, for all you do.
[00:47:23.306 --> 00:47:30.348]  If people are pinning their hopes on the Supreme Court taking a look at this citizenship thing, I don't think it's going to happen.
[00:47:30.348 --> 00:47:34.629]  I think they're going to blow it off and ignore us like they do on everything else these days.
[00:47:34.629 --> 00:47:40.751]  And what you're referring to, because a lot of people don't know, whether or not Barack Obama is actually a U.S.
[00:47:40.751 --> 00:47:45.913]  natural-born citizen, because the controversy is still there, whether or not the man was born in Kenya.
[00:47:45.913 --> 00:47:49.814]  His grandmother wrote in her book that he indeed was born
[00:47:50.314 --> 00:47:53.616]  Well, that's true.
[00:47:53.616 --> 00:48:00.058]  I mean, why would he seal all his records?
[00:48:00.058 --> 00:48:01.939]  Because he was going out to pay for his college.
[00:48:01.939 --> 00:48:07.922]  He was going to school as a foreign student and getting a free ride off of the taxpayer.
[00:48:07.922 --> 00:48:11.403]  But I think things are going to really turn south in this country.
[00:48:11.403 --> 00:48:14.605]  I think we might have one shot at patriots.
[00:48:14.605 --> 00:48:19.287]  Well, what do you think of this crisis that now Biden and
[00:48:20.462 --> 00:48:23.767]  And, uh, Colin Powell of Disgust is going to be on the 21st and the 22nd.
[00:48:23.767 --> 00:48:30.215]  I think that he may just announce the economy's done, that it has to be completely restructured, and maybe it's the death of the dollar.
[00:48:30.215 --> 00:48:33.660]  I mean, I hope that's not it, but, you know, it could very well be it.
[00:48:34.324 --> 00:48:39.746]  Madeline Albright, Colin Powell, you know, and the ever-informed Joe Biden.
[00:48:39.746 --> 00:48:40.906]  Thank goodness for him.
[00:48:40.906 --> 00:48:45.047]  But I'm gonna get off here and hang up, listen to you, and God bless you and Alex for what you do.
[00:48:45.047 --> 00:48:46.608]  All right, thank you so much for the call, Tony.
[00:48:46.608 --> 00:48:49.729]  All right, and speaking of the economy, that's what David wants to talk about next.
[00:48:49.729 --> 00:48:51.249]  Let's go to David.
[00:48:51.249 --> 00:48:53.350]  What's on your mind?
[00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:54.310]  Hello, David?
[00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:55.031]  David?
[00:48:55.031 --> 00:48:56.251]  Yes.
[00:48:56.251 --> 00:48:59.252]  Hey, Jason, I'm gonna pick up speakerphone for a second.
[00:48:59.252 --> 00:49:01.213]  Sure.
[00:49:01.213 --> 00:49:01.533]  Okay.
[00:49:03.338 --> 00:49:10.325]  Last week, actually I think Friday, Alex had on Russell Means from the Lakota tribe.
[00:49:10.325 --> 00:49:11.106]  Yes.
[00:49:11.106 --> 00:49:14.449]  And I was so happy to hear that this guy was being interviewed.
[00:49:14.449 --> 00:49:21.356]  I was expecting him to mention something about the Lakota enterprise that they've got going with the Free Lakota Bank.
[00:49:22.899 --> 00:49:32.270]  The Free Lakota Bank is, in essence, an offshore bank now that the Lakota tribe has declared themselves completely autonomous.
[00:49:33.795 --> 00:49:35.436]  A sovereign state, basically.
[00:49:35.436 --> 00:49:36.276]  Absolutely, yeah.
[00:49:36.276 --> 00:49:37.276]  They are the same.
[00:49:37.276 --> 00:49:40.297]  It would be the same as having a split account, if you open an account at Lakota.
[00:49:40.297 --> 00:49:43.998]  Only thing is, the Lakota Indian is dealing only in silver.
[00:49:43.998 --> 00:49:49.300]  So if you do, and I love this idea, I want you to take on it, and see what you think about it.
[00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:58.243]  If you deposit any amount of cash into their account, I think for the meantime, currently, they'll accept actual fiat paper.
[00:49:58.243 --> 00:50:01.924]  But sometime this next year, they're going to stop, and they're only going to accept silver purchases.
[00:50:02.586 --> 00:50:18.193]  So, the idea is you buy so many ounces of silver, have them hold it for you, you can invest it in the Lakota Tribe itself, and they guarantee an incredible interest rate, an annual rate of 7.24% paid to you in silver.
[00:50:22.029 --> 00:50:24.430]  So, uh, I'd like to get your take on that.
[00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:25.771]  I think it's awesome.
[00:50:25.771 --> 00:50:26.591]  Are you kidding me?
[00:50:26.591 --> 00:50:32.735]  Yeah, I think helping out the Native Americans in any way whatsoever, including their gambling casinos, is a great idea.
[00:50:32.735 --> 00:50:36.096]  I think they've been downtrodden and abused and abused long enough.
[00:50:36.096 --> 00:50:45.241]  This, I would promote to anyone, I would happily suggest this to anyone who's interested in really saving their money.
[00:50:45.241 --> 00:50:46.242]  It's not an investment.
[00:50:46.242 --> 00:50:47.943]  People think, ah, investing in silver is a dead cause.
[00:50:49.059 --> 00:50:55.542]  It's not so much investing in making profit, it's investing in keeping your value and keeping it safe.
[00:50:55.542 --> 00:51:05.346]  Now, these coins that they have minted are minted by an organization which I just found out about called the AOCS, the American Open Currency Standard.
[00:51:05.946 --> 00:51:19.471]  And anyone listening, if you want to go to the AOCS website, I think you just type in AOCS and you get it on any search engine, they have minted Restore the Republic coins with Aaron Russo and Ron Paul.
[00:51:19.471 --> 00:51:23.233]  I would caution people though, because they did go after the Liberty Dollar people at one point.
[00:51:23.652 --> 00:51:24.973]  They did seize a lot of their assets.
[00:51:24.973 --> 00:51:26.755]  Yeah, that was about a year and a half ago.
[00:51:26.755 --> 00:51:28.537]  They went and just took whatever they wanted.
[00:51:28.537 --> 00:51:31.200]  Listen, I encourage people to go and buy silver.
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:34.483]  I think it's down around $11 or $12 right now.
[00:51:34.483 --> 00:51:37.166]  But you still can't get a Liberty Dollar for under $20 on eBay.
[00:51:37.166 --> 00:51:37.706]  Why is that?
[00:51:37.706 --> 00:51:39.468]  Because it's a hard currency.
[00:51:39.468 --> 00:51:42.491]  Hard currency is going to keep a value in any economy.

[00:54:11.565 --> 00:54:14.007]  He stands for what's right.
[00:54:14.007 --> 00:54:17.290]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:17.290 --> 00:54:20.193]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-590-5525.
[00:54:20.193 --> 00:54:23.876]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:54:32.259 --> 00:54:33.681]  Alright folks, we are back.
[00:54:33.681 --> 00:54:34.902]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:34.902 --> 00:54:39.546]  I am Jason Bermas sitting in for the second hour over here at KLBJ.
[00:54:39.546 --> 00:54:47.473]  Remember you can check out all of Alex's documentary films and a lot more by becoming a PrisonPlanet.TV subscriber.
[00:54:47.473 --> 00:54:47.974]  Now we spent
[00:54:48.687 --> 00:54:51.269]  You know, I believe Obama is going to take our guns.
[00:54:51.269 --> 00:54:53.030]  I believe he's going to do something.
[00:55:13.658 --> 00:55:19.819]  So, obviously, I encourage everybody to go out and buy as many as they can, as well as ammo.
[00:55:19.819 --> 00:55:28.101]  Above and beyond that, everybody, we need to learn how to shoot, which brings me to my main point of my main call, or my main reason for calling.
[00:55:28.101 --> 00:55:30.501]  A little nervous, sorry.
[00:55:30.501 --> 00:55:35.722]  Appleseed.org is a grassroots movement.
[00:55:35.722 --> 00:55:37.462]  It's all volunteer.
[00:55:37.462 --> 00:55:40.863]  They're going around the country training citizens.
[00:55:41.713 --> 00:55:43.735]  How to become a rifleman.
[00:55:55.686 --> 00:55:56.847]  Pro-Second Amendment.
[00:55:56.847 --> 00:56:00.269]  I think people should know how to operate a firearm.
[00:56:00.269 --> 00:56:03.752]  Obviously, the Second Amendment was there for well-organized militias.
[00:56:03.752 --> 00:56:12.077]  That meant you and your community, the ones that could handle guns, really males 16 and above, who knew how to fire that and organize.
[00:56:12.077 --> 00:56:18.762]  And we've kind of lost that in this country, mainly because the media has demonized the militia movement, mostly with the
[00:56:19.182 --> 00:56:19.622]  You know what?
[00:56:19.622 --> 00:56:20.903]  People don't know how to use their guns.
[00:56:20.903 --> 00:56:21.224]  That's true.
[00:56:21.224 --> 00:56:21.904]  That's the point.
[00:56:45.701 --> 00:56:48.182]  Appleseedinfo.org.
[00:56:48.182 --> 00:56:50.684]  And, you know, I know you talk to Alex a lot.
[00:56:50.684 --> 00:56:55.486]  And by the way, before I make my point, I just want to say it's very refreshing to have you on occasionally.
[00:56:55.486 --> 00:56:58.927]  Nothing taken away from Alex, but I do enjoy listening to you.
[00:56:58.927 --> 00:57:00.588]  Oh, thank you.
[00:57:00.588 --> 00:57:03.930]  But if you talk to him, you know, ask him.
[00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:04.850]  Plug Appleseed.
[00:57:04.850 --> 00:57:06.231]  Appleseedinfo.org.
[00:57:06.231 --> 00:57:08.212]  These guys are really doing it.
[00:57:08.212 --> 00:57:09.633]  They're getting guys out there.
[00:57:09.633 --> 00:57:13.774]  And it's a way for us to meet like-minded people in our area.
[00:57:13.774 --> 00:57:14.655]  Because, to be honest with you,
[00:57:15.382 --> 00:57:16.023]  Some people.
[00:57:16.023 --> 00:57:16.803]  I'm not one of them.
[00:57:16.803 --> 00:57:21.547]  Some people are a little afraid to talk about what's going on.
[00:57:21.547 --> 00:57:22.247]  Well, I agree.
[00:57:22.247 --> 00:57:23.488]  I thank you for the call, Frank.
[00:57:23.488 --> 00:57:24.729]  It's another way of being prepared.
[00:57:24.729 --> 00:57:30.453]  You know, it's just like if in case one of these executive orders, you know, is about guns.
[00:57:30.453 --> 00:57:35.016]  Well, you have your guns and you're going to fight for your Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:57:35.016 --> 00:57:41.261]  If one of these executive orders is about the restriction of food, it wouldn't be a bad idea to have yourself
[00:57:41.841 --> 00:57:46.723]  Some storable food, you know, some canned food, some pasta that you can cook for a while.
[00:57:46.723 --> 00:57:49.683]  I really like that Alex sells the E-Cola Blue System.
[00:57:49.683 --> 00:57:51.944]  It's probably my favorite thing in the office.
[00:57:51.944 --> 00:57:55.125]  The thing pulls water right from the air and it purifies it.
[00:57:55.125 --> 00:57:58.426]  You know, I don't have to worry about drinking salt in my Dasani water.
[00:57:58.426 --> 00:58:00.507]  I mean, they put all sorts of sodium in that.
[00:58:00.507 --> 00:58:10.490]  I don't have to worry about, you know, fluoride or chlorine or some of the other delicious nutrients that are put into the tap water because it all comes through.
[00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:10.810]  It's all
[00:58:11.755 --> 00:58:12.736]  We're good to go!
[00:58:34.657 --> 00:58:37.978]  He's going to be, I think he's the opposite of Cheney.
[00:58:37.978 --> 00:58:40.119]  He's going to be the likable Vice President.
[00:58:40.119 --> 00:58:43.400]  He's like the drunk uncle that you like.
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:46.422]  When you go to the holidays, he's the guy you can kick back with.
[00:58:46.422 --> 00:58:51.003]  You can talk about girls and sports and really have a good time.
[00:58:51.003 --> 00:58:53.985]  However, he's not that at all.
[00:58:55.635 --> 00:59:02.216]  He's written an article back in the early 90s for the Wall Street Journal entitled, How I Learned to Love the New World Order.
[00:59:02.216 --> 00:59:07.417]  This is another guy who is a CFR, Council on Foreign Relations, globalist.
[00:59:07.417 --> 00:59:16.839]  And the one thing I will say about Biden is that he is more apt to talk about issues such as the ISI in Pakistan, even though he tries to cover them up.
[00:59:16.839 --> 00:59:24.121]  He actually, when Judge Roberts was elected to, or going through the process of being confirmed for the Supreme Court, he asked him,
[00:59:24.545 --> 00:59:26.086]  About biometrics and the chip.
[00:59:26.086 --> 00:59:28.567]  That might be a clip that we're going to pull up in the next segment.
[00:59:28.567 --> 00:59:39.972]  He asked Roberts how he was going to rule and that basically he was going to rule eventually on whether or not we put a chip in a human being to track them all the time.
[00:59:39.972 --> 00:59:46.934]  Or we scan their brains to see if there's criminal activity or the potential for criminal activity going on through their brains.
[00:59:46.934 --> 00:59:47.615]  You don't believe me?
[00:59:47.615 --> 00:59:48.295]  Well, glad.
[00:59:48.295 --> 00:59:50.276]  I'm glad you don't believe me because we're going to play it in the next segment.
[00:59:50.276 --> 00:59:51.116]  Stick around.
[00:59:51.116 --> 00:59:51.856]  It actually happened.
[00:59:53.542 --> 01:00:02.146]  Biden was very very well aware of this Pakistani element involved in the 9-11 attacks.
[01:00:02.146 --> 01:00:05.768]  We mentioned it before, you know, he was meeting with the head of the ISI.
[01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:08.870]  He got on the floor of the house and talked about Pakistan's role.
[01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:16.674]  He is currently on a diplomatic quote-unquote fact-finding mission to see what's going over there in that crazy land of Pakistan.
[01:00:16.674 --> 01:00:18.975]  Well really it's just a cover-up mission
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:26.543]  Where how they're going to be able to explain Pakistan as an ally diplomatically to the rest of the world and bring people together.
[01:00:26.543 --> 01:00:29.825]  That's what this is really about.
[01:00:29.825 --> 01:00:40.749]  I only got a couple minutes left in this segment so we're gonna wait to the next segment to play a section from my film Fabled Enemies in the beginning of the next segment where Joe Biden gets on the House floor.
[01:00:40.749 --> 01:00:42.930]  Oh, we got plenty of time?
[01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:43.571]  Alright, let's play it.
[01:00:43.571 --> 01:00:45.872]  Let's play the Pakistani ISI clip then.
[01:00:45.872 --> 01:00:46.652]  Let's do it right now.
[01:00:47.725 --> 01:00:54.271]  Senator Joe Biden, who had also met with the head of the Pakistani ISI, would have harsh words on the Senate floor.
[01:00:54.271 --> 01:01:10.907]  And the word should go out to those who pretend that they wish to be our friends, that they're going to have to make some very difficult choices, Pakistan in particular.
[01:01:11.775 --> 01:01:16.621]  He's going to have to make a very difficult choice very soon.
[01:01:16.621 --> 01:01:19.225]  Words will not be sufficient.
[01:01:19.225 --> 01:01:22.829]  Actions will be demanded.
[01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:29.698]  When Biden was confronted, he confirmed his meeting with Ahmed, saying Pakistani intelligence was indeed funding the Taliban.
[01:01:30.628 --> 01:01:33.411]  Sir, sir, I have a question.
[01:01:33.411 --> 01:01:37.895]  In the days following 9-11, you met with the head of Pakistani ISI, General Mohammad Ahmed.
[01:01:37.895 --> 01:01:42.679]  It has since come to light that he ordered Saeed Sheikh to wire $100,000 to Mohammad Ata.
[01:01:42.679 --> 01:01:47.724]  Why was he allowed to go back to Pakistan, and why was he questioned, and why were you meeting with him?
[01:01:47.724 --> 01:01:52.448]  I met with him to deliver a message that if he didn't, if he didn't,
[01:01:53.141 --> 01:01:55.763]  Stop supporting the Taliban.
[01:01:55.763 --> 01:01:56.764]  We would take him on.
[01:01:56.764 --> 01:01:57.625]  Why did we let him go?
[01:01:57.625 --> 01:01:58.445]  We let him fly freely.
[01:01:58.445 --> 01:01:59.506]  We never investigated him.
[01:01:59.506 --> 01:02:00.527]  We never even looked into him.
[01:02:00.527 --> 01:02:03.589]  Look, there's a thing called diplomatic passports.
[01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:05.871]  We did not arrest Khrushchev when he came.
[01:02:05.871 --> 01:02:08.513]  But he financed the hijackers and you let him go and he's free.
[01:02:08.513 --> 01:02:09.934]  He hijacked the hijackers.
[01:02:09.934 --> 01:02:11.736]  No one knew he financed the hijackers.
[01:02:11.736 --> 01:02:15.258]  It's a lie.
[01:02:15.258 --> 01:02:18.381]  He would later state that the information was indeed classified.
[01:02:30.088 --> 01:02:38.170]  So we shouldn't be surprised that that remains classified and that Biden is trying to tell anybody who's trying to get to the bottom of these facts to get life.
[01:02:38.170 --> 01:02:43.911]  You know, how dare we ask questions that actually affect our foreign and domestic policy here at home?
[01:02:43.911 --> 01:02:46.672]  You know, real foreign and domestic policy.
[01:02:47.307 --> 01:02:50.589]  And then, you know, in the second encounter, he was smart enough to say it's classified.
[01:02:50.589 --> 01:02:52.390]  Well, I got news for you folks.
[01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:54.292]  A whole lot is classified on 9-11.
[01:02:54.292 --> 01:02:54.692]  A whole lot!
[01:02:57.832 --> 01:03:04.715]  You know, just for starters, the initial congressional investigation, the public one, has 27 redacted pages.
[01:03:04.715 --> 01:03:19.282]  We had Bob Graham, who was the co-chair of that committee, get on PBS, and this is again in Fabled Enemies, and say that there were foreign governments involved in 9-11, and that information is going to be classified for 20 to 30 years.
[01:03:19.282 --> 01:03:20.463]  Here we are, a little over
[01:03:21.562 --> 01:03:23.944]  Seven years after 9-11.
[01:03:23.944 --> 01:03:30.369]  And you can bet that the stuff is going to remain classified for another 15 or 20 years.
[01:03:30.369 --> 01:03:31.730]  Or 25 years.
[01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:33.151]  Or whatever they want!
[01:03:33.151 --> 01:03:34.713]  And they'll spin it.
[01:03:34.713 --> 01:03:38.876]  They'll release a few documents, a little bit of plausible deniability here.
[01:03:38.876 --> 01:03:41.198]  When they want to create an enemy, they'll expose their role in it.
[01:03:41.198 --> 01:03:41.978]  Makes me sick.
[01:03:41.978 --> 01:03:43.820]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:46.882]  We encourage you to go over to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:03:46.882 --> 01:03:48.003]  I'm Jason Bermas.

[01:05:55.259 --> 01:05:59.481]  Are you one of the people who think, I have plenty of time, nothing's ever going to happen bad to me.
[01:05:59.481 --> 01:06:04.943]  Do you believe that when your cupboards are bare, our corporate controlled government will jump right in to feed you and yours?
[01:06:04.943 --> 01:06:07.825]  Do you have at least a year's supply of food for your family?
[01:06:07.825 --> 01:06:10.606]  This is Kurt, the armchair survivalist heard on this network.
[01:06:10.606 --> 01:06:12.847]  Survival Enterprises sells real food canned for
[01:06:12.927 --> 01:06:13.207]  Oh my God!
[01:06:43.993 --> 01:06:44.674]  We're good to go.
[01:06:54.986 --> 01:06:56.748]  Hello, I'm Steve Shang.
[01:06:56.748 --> 01:07:03.714]  For the past several months, folks have constantly asked me to give them the date as to when they should be finished stocking up on food.
[01:07:03.714 --> 01:07:13.844]  We've been so beaten up by stock market banking, housing, and unemployment crashes that we're desensitized and frozen inactive like the frog being unknowingly cooked in gradually increasingly hot water.
[01:07:14.324 --> 01:07:15.285]  Well, snap out of it.
[01:07:15.285 --> 01:07:16.766]  We now have a deadline.
[01:07:16.766 --> 01:07:18.808]  Joe Biden said it's going to happen.
[01:07:18.808 --> 01:07:30.717]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press and pointed to about January 22nd as the time a major international incident would force the new president to make unpopular decisions.
[01:07:30.717 --> 01:07:36.862]  Well, I take the general at his word and my best advice is to have your food in your possession prior to the inauguration.
[01:07:36.862 --> 01:07:41.686]  Contact efoodsdirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline for disaster.
[01:07:42.279 --> 01:07:46.603]  Ask yourself, is it better to have too much too soon, or too little too late?
[01:07:46.603 --> 01:07:58.332]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:07:58.332 --> 01:08:00.814]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[01:08:00.814 --> 01:08:02.075]  Well, search no more.
[01:08:02.075 --> 01:08:04.296]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.855 --> 01:08:18.296]  Alright folks, we're back.
[01:08:18.296 --> 01:08:21.298]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:21.298 --> 01:08:24.681]  And you know, I'm gonna finish up my tirade on Joe Biden.
[01:08:24.681 --> 01:08:32.707]  And we're gonna go to some calls in a moment, but not before we play the clip where Joe Biden tells Judge Roberts, Supreme Court Justice,
[01:08:33.379 --> 01:08:44.566]  That he is going to not only rule on human microchips in his tenure, but he's also going to rule on machines that read our minds and find out whether we're bad or we're good.
[01:08:44.566 --> 01:08:48.449]  It's very Minority Report, only this isn't Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg.
[01:08:48.449 --> 01:08:52.231]  This is something that could come to us within the next 10 to 15 years.
[01:08:52.231 --> 01:08:52.932]  Let's play the clip.
[01:08:53.815 --> 01:08:59.057]  Can a microscopic tag be implanted in a person's body to track his every movement?
[01:08:59.057 --> 01:09:01.178]  There's actual discussion about that.
[01:09:01.178 --> 01:09:05.980]  You will rule on that, mark my words, before your tenure is over.
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:12.062]  Can brain scans be used to determine whether a person is inclined toward criminality or violent behavior?
[01:09:12.062 --> 01:09:14.143]  You will rule on that.
[01:09:15.009 --> 01:09:18.371]  Alright, so, you know, Biden is an in-the-know guy.
[01:09:18.371 --> 01:09:20.392]  He's a savvy guy.
[01:09:20.392 --> 01:09:22.653]  He's played the political game for a while.
[01:09:22.653 --> 01:09:25.915]  But I hate to tell you folks, he's on board with globalism.
[01:09:25.915 --> 01:09:28.516]  He's on board with the new world order.
[01:09:28.516 --> 01:09:31.597]  He's there to make you think you have a choice.
[01:09:31.597 --> 01:09:34.939]  He's the good cop in the good cop, bad cop scenario.
[01:09:34.939 --> 01:09:38.741]  Only right now, the establishment is trying to give you good cop, good cop.
[01:09:38.741 --> 01:09:41.883]  You know, everybody, you know, still thinks that there's hope and change.
[01:09:41.883 --> 01:09:44.704]  You know, I got off a plane
[01:09:45.455 --> 01:09:45.855]  I don't
[01:10:04.656 --> 01:10:10.922]  The fake little studs, like all the little studs in it, you know, like rubies into Barack Obama and he looks really cool.
[01:10:10.922 --> 01:10:13.685]  But there's the ones with just like the portrait of the face on there.
[01:10:13.685 --> 01:10:16.167]  It's not vote Barack Obama or Obama 08.
[01:10:16.167 --> 01:10:19.810]  It's actually fashionable to wear Barack Obama wear.
[01:10:19.810 --> 01:10:21.252]  Hey, I got news for you.
[01:10:21.252 --> 01:10:23.374]  The guy ain't Martin Luther King Jr., okay?
[01:10:23.374 --> 01:10:24.375]  He's not.
[01:10:24.375 --> 01:10:25.676]  He's not John F. Kennedy.
[01:10:26.348 --> 01:10:27.588]  Yeah, yes sir, thank you for taking my call.
[01:10:52.438 --> 01:10:53.819]  We're good to go.
[01:11:07.734 --> 01:11:13.897]  Well, I gotta tell you, it's not surprising.
[01:11:13.897 --> 01:11:17.978]  First of all, because Egyptian intelligence and American intelligence have worked closely for years.
[01:11:17.978 --> 01:11:18.739]  It's an ally.
[01:11:18.739 --> 01:11:23.741]  And now that, you know, American imperialism has taken over Iraq, we have no desire to get out of there.
[01:11:23.741 --> 01:11:27.402]  I mean, if you look at those transition plans where we're supposed to be out by 2010,
[01:11:28.823 --> 01:11:34.126]  No, we're supposed to start really withdrawing by 2010 and supposedly by 2012 we're going to be out of there.
[01:11:34.126 --> 01:11:35.006]  I doubt it.
[01:11:35.006 --> 01:11:35.407]  Okay?
[01:11:35.407 --> 01:11:35.827]  Yeah.
[01:11:35.827 --> 01:11:37.608]  We're always going to have a presence there.
[01:11:37.608 --> 01:11:43.451]  What this is is an expansion of what they've wanted all along and that is a Eurasian Union out there.
[01:11:43.451 --> 01:11:50.315]  You know, it is, in all these guys, these top internationalist policy papers in their books, they talk about Eurasia and its importance.
[01:11:50.315 --> 01:11:54.877]  And really the only thing standing in their way of a Eurasian Union right now is Iran.
[01:11:55.433 --> 01:11:58.636]  And possibly, you know, the Palestinian-Israeli situation.
[01:11:58.636 --> 01:12:04.903]  But, you know, Saudi Arabia is pretty on board with the United States, even though we're screwing them on gas right now.
[01:12:04.903 --> 01:12:07.245]  We're kind of undercutting them on the oil bids.
[01:12:07.245 --> 01:12:08.867]  We still have a decent relationship with them.
[01:12:08.867 --> 01:12:11.389]  We've had a decent relationship with Egypt.
[01:12:11.389 --> 01:12:16.154]  You know, Pakistan and India both have to remain somewhat allied with the United States.
[01:12:16.474 --> 01:12:35.285]  We've forcefully taken over both Afghanistan and Iraq, really the only domino to fall before they're able to create this, and obviously before they totally create it, they need to expand, you know, relationships with, you know, people like Iraq and Egypt, giving them roads and such and infrastructure so they can interrelate.
[01:12:35.285 --> 01:12:37.747]  So, it's not a shock to me that they would do that.
[01:12:37.747 --> 01:12:42.650]  I'm surprised that they're not going to try to build something like a superhighway like they're trying to do here for the North American Union.
[01:12:43.177 --> 01:12:48.424]  Well, I thought maybe it might be a bridge in the international waters there in the Red Sea, perhaps.
[01:12:48.424 --> 01:12:49.345]  That's a possibility.
[01:12:49.345 --> 01:12:51.788]  To eliminate any trafficking for Jordan itself.
[01:12:51.788 --> 01:12:57.436]  But one of the preconditions was that Iraq had to be allied with Israel.
[01:12:58.837 --> 01:12:59.757]  Is that a shock again?
[01:12:59.757 --> 01:13:03.298]  I mean, you know, Israel is probably our top ally.
[01:13:03.298 --> 01:13:08.220]  They had a huge role in 9-11, in this international intelligence organization.
[01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:14.782]  It's time to stop thinking, and I thank you for the call, Joe, about separate intelligence agencies and countries.
[01:13:14.782 --> 01:13:16.022]  I got news for you.
[01:13:16.022 --> 01:13:18.303]  They all work together, okay?
[01:13:18.303 --> 01:13:24.325]  It's just like, of course there's a stipulation that they're gonna have to be banded with Israel.
[01:13:24.325 --> 01:13:25.685]  We run Iraq now.
[01:13:25.685 --> 01:13:28.446]  We run it even more than we did when we put Saddam Hussein in.
[01:13:29.053 --> 01:13:29.573]  Okay?
[01:13:29.573 --> 01:13:37.478]  That was our dictator for a time, and then when he didn't want to do exactly what we wanted, it's time to go in and take it over.
[01:13:37.478 --> 01:13:39.239]  Alright, let's go to Don.
[01:13:39.239 --> 01:13:41.760]  He wants to talk about Obama being born in Kenya.
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.481]  What's on your mind, Don?
[01:13:43.481 --> 01:13:44.462]  Hey, how you doing, Jason?
[01:13:44.462 --> 01:13:45.522]  Good, man.
[01:13:45.522 --> 01:13:53.907]  Hey, I was on a couple forums today, and they were talking about that his parents' divorce decree states he's born in Kenya, and it's supposed to be coming public.
[01:13:54.826 --> 01:13:58.949]  This could be something that people could look into and possibly find.
[01:14:13.917 --> 01:14:18.624]  Uh, Webster Tarpley has now put out two separate books, uh, you can get them over at Infowars.com.
[01:14:18.624 --> 01:14:22.849]  Obama, The Postmodern Coup, and I, I can't remember what the second one is off, off the top.
[01:14:22.849 --> 01:14:28.016]  Phil Berg, you know, the lawyer who's behind this, um, you know, they don't want to listen to those guys.
[01:14:28.016 --> 01:14:30.099]  They, they're being marginalized in the media.
[01:14:30.851 --> 01:14:32.653]  Reprehensibly, by the way.
[01:14:32.653 --> 01:14:34.894]  And I, you know, I don't think much will come out of it.
[01:14:34.894 --> 01:14:48.345]  Maybe it'll be admitted long after Obama's president, maybe ten years after, and it may be used as an excuse to get somebody like Arnold Schwarzenegger or some other internationalist into the highest office in the United States.
[01:14:48.345 --> 01:14:50.507]  Yeah, I think they have a contract on air-ground checkings, I worry.
[01:14:50.507 --> 01:14:51.688]  Anybody could be president.
[01:14:51.688 --> 01:14:54.770]  Yeah, I think that's been in the cards for a while.
[01:14:54.770 --> 01:14:57.272]  Whether or not they can actually achieve it is another question.
[01:14:57.272 --> 01:14:58.193]  I thank you for the call, Don.
[01:14:58.872 --> 01:15:00.473]  All right, let's go to Jeff.
[01:15:00.473 --> 01:15:05.097]  Jeff wants to talk about where you can get some silver between now and the 21st.
[01:15:05.097 --> 01:15:07.699]  And before we go to Jeff, I'd just like to say there's silver all over.
[01:15:07.699 --> 01:15:12.203]  I mean, obviously, Ted Anderson and Midas Resources really support this show.
[01:15:12.203 --> 01:15:14.945]  You can go on eBay and get silver dollars.
[01:15:14.945 --> 01:15:24.092]  What I really like about Ted Anderson is that for around $26, you can get a copy of The Creature from Jekyll Island and a one-ounce silver coin.
[01:15:24.092 --> 01:15:25.533]  And that's for $26.
[01:15:25.533 --> 01:15:27.535]  That's a great deal because not only do you get the book,
[01:15:28.055 --> 01:15:35.039]  But you get the silver, and you know, you give that to somebody, they're like, oh, cool, a silver piece, but you get information.
[01:15:35.039 --> 01:15:38.261]  And The Creature from Jekyll Island is an amazing book.
[01:15:38.261 --> 01:15:39.402]  He gives a lecture about it.
[01:15:39.402 --> 01:15:40.562]  You can get it online.
[01:15:40.562 --> 01:15:42.163]  His World Without Cancer lecture is great.
[01:15:42.163 --> 01:15:43.984]  His New World Order lecture is great.
[01:15:43.984 --> 01:15:56.512]  But especially how this fiat banking system was created is important so that people understand that, you know, the bailout and Henry Paulson are nothing more than allusions to try to
[01:15:57.438 --> 01:15:59.720]  Get you to look away from the real issues.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:00.520]  Jeff, what's on your mind?
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:03.642]  You answered my question there.
[01:16:03.642 --> 01:16:15.691]  I was looking for a resource somewhere that you can do something fairly quickly to transfer some dollars into some kind of hard currency before they play whatever little game it is they're going to play.
[01:16:15.691 --> 01:16:22.916]  And I think that's a smart move because, you know, like myself, you probably can't afford gold at around 8, you know, even when I'm not even sure what gold's at.
[01:16:22.916 --> 01:16:24.517]  It might be around 830, 840, somewhere, you know, under 900.
[01:16:26.678 --> 01:16:29.461]  You can't get an ounce of gold for under $900 on the internet.
[01:16:29.461 --> 01:16:34.085]  You know, they all charge premiums, and that's why Ted Anderson and Midas Resources are great.
[01:16:34.085 --> 01:16:40.410]  I've got some silver in case of an emergency, hopefully enough to get me out of the country or wherever I need to go, if it happens.
[01:16:40.410 --> 01:16:41.712]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:16:41.712 --> 01:16:43.153]  We will be back after this.
[01:16:43.153 --> 01:16:44.954]  I'm Jason Bermas, InfoWars.com.
[01:16:55.084 --> 01:16:56.364]  I am so frustrated.
[01:16:56.364 --> 01:16:58.705]  I can't seem to remember anything anymore.
[01:16:58.705 --> 01:16:59.285]  What?
[01:16:59.285 --> 01:17:02.046]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible.
[01:17:02.046 --> 01:17:03.466]  I read something and forget.
[01:17:03.466 --> 01:17:04.706]  I forget people's names.
[01:17:04.706 --> 01:17:08.507]  I hear all this great information on the radio and I want to tell people, but I forget.
[01:17:08.507 --> 01:17:10.248]  I- Okay, slow down.
[01:17:10.248 --> 01:17:12.828]  Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault.
[01:17:12.828 --> 01:17:19.970]  Factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum in deodorants, genetically modified foods, the way the education system taught you.
[01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:21.590]  It's all meant to dumb you down.
[01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:23.331]  You know, I can remember everything now.
[01:17:23.331 --> 01:17:24.251]  Even entire books.
[01:17:24.491 --> 01:17:24.791]  What?
[01:17:24.791 --> 01:17:25.332]  How?
[01:17:25.332 --> 01:17:28.595]  There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory.
[01:17:28.595 --> 01:17:32.379]  Their online course is a real breakthrough in the field of memory improvement.
[01:17:32.379 --> 01:17:42.028]  In fact, they guarantee that every single person will be able to memorize any type of information, including entire books, after they complete just 60 lessons.
[01:17:42.028 --> 01:17:47.393]  And they offer a no-questions-asked, no-time-limit, money-back guarantee.
[01:17:47.393 --> 01:17:47.913]  Wow.
[01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:48.674]  What's the website?
[01:17:48.914 --> 01:17:52.404]  Now don't forget, it's P Memory dot net.

[01:21:04.974 --> 01:21:17.089]  As I sit here, there's a little TV in the office, Brit Hume interviews the Bush Boys, old man Bush.
[01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:31.614]  And the W. And they're talking Obama, and of course, George Bush is just so impressed with the people that Obama has appointed to his team.
[01:21:31.614 --> 01:21:35.935]  That transition team, wow, and his new administration is going to be great.
[01:21:35.935 --> 01:21:40.077]  You know, these guys, you know, they tell you they're different.
[01:21:40.077 --> 01:21:41.978]  They give you the illusion of a difference.
[01:21:41.978 --> 01:21:44.419]  Democrat, Republican, conservative, liberal.
[01:21:44.419 --> 01:21:49.420]  No, they play for the same team, the globalists.
[01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:50.981]  Kind of want to switch gears here.
[01:21:52.025 --> 01:21:57.629]  I'm looking at the, I think it's the Austin American-Statesman here, or one of the Austin Chronicles.
[01:21:57.629 --> 01:21:58.570]  I'm not sure which one it is.
[01:21:58.570 --> 01:22:07.516]  Main paper here, and in the Insights section, they're basically talking about the great things that genetic modification can do for us.
[01:22:07.516 --> 01:22:13.781]  And we are in this age where a lot of things are possible.
[01:22:13.781 --> 01:22:17.264]  There's a mutation in some people that they have a third set of teeth.
[01:22:18.379 --> 01:22:21.820]  I don't know about you, but I've got a couple cavities here and there.
[01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:23.421]  This is my last set of teeth.
[01:22:23.421 --> 01:22:25.782]  I even have a tooth pulled in the back.
[01:22:25.782 --> 01:22:29.363]  Some people also have to get their wisdom teeth pulled.
[01:22:29.363 --> 01:22:31.244]  But I wouldn't mind a third set of teeth.
[01:22:31.244 --> 01:22:31.964]  That'd be great.
[01:22:31.964 --> 01:22:33.965]  You know, as you get older, they get a little more yellow.
[01:22:33.965 --> 01:22:34.745]  Just pop them out.
[01:22:34.745 --> 01:22:36.386]  Oh, here comes number three.
[01:22:36.386 --> 01:22:43.489]  Well, now they're talking about taking this mutation in some people and harnessing it so they can give it to anybody who would need it.
[01:22:44.970 --> 01:22:47.391]  Now, this is, this is the public stuff.
[01:22:47.391 --> 01:22:52.273]  This is the stuff that's, you know, meant for everybody to consume and say, oh, that's a great idea.
[01:22:52.273 --> 01:22:53.773]  That is good stuff.
[01:22:53.773 --> 01:22:58.395]  You know, it's just like, uh, you know, we talked about that chip earlier and Joe Biden talking about it.
[01:22:58.395 --> 01:23:06.698]  Well, uh, the human microchip has been around for a while now, and it's actually been put in some people's brains who are blind and it gives them sight.
[01:23:06.698 --> 01:23:08.159]  Now they can't see like you or me.
[01:23:09.278 --> 01:23:16.181]  Basically, hooks it up so they can see, kind of like if anybody's seen the Predator movie, where they can see different tones of objects.
[01:23:16.181 --> 01:23:18.062]  It's more than being colorblind.
[01:23:18.062 --> 01:23:19.662]  They can see the outlines, no problem.
[01:23:19.662 --> 01:23:21.443]  They're not going to walk into things.
[01:23:21.443 --> 01:23:23.604]  But they don't see an enormous amount of detail.
[01:23:23.604 --> 01:23:26.225]  They see in basic colors.
[01:23:26.225 --> 01:23:28.086]  And, you know, movement.
[01:23:28.086 --> 01:23:32.488]  But that's an incredible thing to give to a person with no sight.
[01:23:32.488 --> 01:23:33.228]  You know?
[01:23:33.228 --> 01:23:34.729]  Basically giving them eyes.
[01:23:34.729 --> 01:23:35.889]  A new way to get around.
[01:23:35.889 --> 01:23:38.310]  Sounds great on paper, and I'm all for that kind of stuff.
[01:23:38.976 --> 01:23:44.218]  When it starts to get spooky is when they want to regulate what you eat.
[01:23:44.218 --> 01:23:47.139]  They want to genetically modify the cattle.
[01:23:47.139 --> 01:23:48.840]  They want to pump them full of hormones.
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:50.700]  They want to clone them.
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:54.962]  And they want to make them susceptible for all these different types of genetic disease.
[01:23:54.962 --> 01:24:01.304]  And there's a thing coming around the bend that has already been implemented in a lot of places.
[01:24:01.304 --> 01:24:03.105]  And it's called Codex Elementarius.
[01:24:03.105 --> 01:24:07.807]  And it is going to give companies like Monsanto the right
[01:24:08.427 --> 01:24:10.729]  to decide what we can and cannot eat.
[01:24:10.729 --> 01:24:15.993]  It's going to give the state, in effect, authority over the nutrients we're allowed to put in our body.
[01:24:15.993 --> 01:24:16.934]  Now, what do you mean?
[01:24:16.934 --> 01:24:29.064]  Well, you can still go to a farmer's market and pick up some eggs, maybe a fresh piece of meat, some delicious produce, without much of a problem.
[01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:33.668]  But soon enough, that's going to be regulated and you're only going to be able to go to Walmart.
[01:24:33.668 --> 01:24:37.511]  You know, places like Whole Foods might not even be around because they have so much organic stuff.
[01:24:38.297 --> 01:24:46.700]  This is a way for the top 2% of the world, the biggest companies, to regulate what you eat and what goes into your body.
[01:24:46.700 --> 01:25:00.525]  Personally, I am not going to be trusting government regulations that have led to vaccinations with mercury in them, with cancer-causing agents such as SV40 in them, in the preservatives, simian virus 40.
[01:25:00.525 --> 01:25:01.226]  Look into it!
[01:25:01.226 --> 01:25:05.767]  Check out how delicious SV40 is and what it's been put into.
[01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:18.861]  I mean, it is almost common knowledge with anybody with half a brain that most people suffering from autism, nine-tenths of them, are suffering from mercury poisoning.
[01:25:18.861 --> 01:25:29.052]  You know, it was kind of underplayed by the media, but a few months ago, Jim Carrey and his girlfriend, Jenny McCarthy, Jenny McCarthy has a son,
[01:25:30.609 --> 01:25:36.530]  Uh, got on television and discussed her son's autism and how it had been cured through a nutritional diet.
[01:25:36.530 --> 01:25:43.111]  Basically, they started feeding him the right foods and it combated all this poison in his system.
[01:25:43.111 --> 01:25:48.432]  And they also, you know, they tried to use the hipster term, green the vaccines.
[01:25:48.432 --> 01:25:49.873]  You know, that's my one problem with it.
[01:25:49.873 --> 01:25:55.334]  Look, I'm all for getting the poison out of the vaccines, but the green movement is nonsense.
[01:25:55.334 --> 01:25:56.874]  It's so much nonsense, in fact.
[01:25:57.446 --> 01:26:02.810]  That, uh, anyone here who saw Quantum of Solace, the latest Bond film, what's the plot about?
[01:26:02.810 --> 01:26:11.675]  Well, the plot is about a industrialist named Michael Green, who is going to bring the environment great things in the third world.
[01:26:11.675 --> 01:26:20.261]  So, basically they go, they buy off third world dictators, and it's kind of like a Bechtel scam, where they say that they're going to improve the quality of the drinking water.
[01:26:21.451 --> 01:26:29.335]  And instead of that, they regulate the drinking water, the quality gets worse, and you have to pay triple about it, all under the guise of environmentalism.
[01:26:29.335 --> 01:26:31.297]  And this guy was implementing similar things.
[01:26:31.297 --> 01:26:38.120]  It was all about contracts and controlling the water, and basically enslaving the people and making a profit.
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:43.383]  And of course, he buys his third world dictator for money, and he's the one with the real power.
[01:26:43.383 --> 01:26:44.744]  The dictator is a puppet.
[01:26:45.891 --> 01:26:47.432]  And that's the real deal.
[01:26:47.432 --> 01:26:48.773]  They throw it in your face.
[01:26:48.773 --> 01:26:49.574]  I'm sorry, folks.
[01:26:49.574 --> 01:27:00.382]  I know a lot of you guys are heartbroken out there that I'm about to say that global warming is a myth, but we're having the coldest New York on record right now.
[01:27:00.382 --> 01:27:03.205]  In case you didn't know, New York City just got 8 inches of snow.
[01:27:03.205 --> 01:27:05.587]  Doesn't seem like it's warming, does it?
[01:27:05.587 --> 01:27:09.410]  I just came in from an ice storm, okay?
[01:27:09.410 --> 01:27:14.914]  I think the greatest film out there that really takes my position
[01:27:15.874 --> 01:27:19.617]  is the great global warming swindle which was aired on the BBC.
[01:27:19.617 --> 01:27:34.809]  You literally have the co-founder of Greenpeace among other scientists and academics in the film talking about how not only is global warming nonsense but how you can't get any funding unless you're in support of global warming and it is
[01:27:35.586 --> 01:27:44.252]  Almost like you're treated like a leper in the scientific community when you don't go along with it in many circles, because those circles want their money.
[01:27:44.252 --> 01:27:52.518]  They want to be able to keep doing what they're doing, and the more you can try to prove that global warming exists, the more money they're going to give you.
[01:27:52.518 --> 01:27:55.280]  I, again, really... Great global warming swindle.
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:55.940]  It's on YouTube.
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:57.141]  It's on Google Video.
[01:27:57.141 --> 01:27:58.722]  Please go watch it.
[01:27:58.722 --> 01:27:59.963]  Challenge me, you know?
[01:27:59.963 --> 01:28:03.326]  Please, please explain to me how global warming is real.
[01:28:03.326 --> 01:28:05.107]  You know, climate change is real, and that's why
[01:28:05.632 --> 01:28:10.956]  You've heard politicians switch the term from global warming to global climate change.
[01:28:10.956 --> 01:28:12.578]  No, climate's going to change.
[01:28:12.578 --> 01:28:13.298]  I got news for you.
[01:28:13.298 --> 01:28:14.739]  The Earth moves.
[01:28:14.739 --> 01:28:16.561]  The Sun moves.
[01:28:16.561 --> 01:28:16.961]  Okay?
[01:28:16.961 --> 01:28:19.563]  The solar system moves.
[01:28:19.563 --> 01:28:22.566]  We have gone through different hot and cold spells.
[01:28:22.566 --> 01:28:24.567]  We went through an ice age, folks.
[01:28:24.567 --> 01:28:26.689]  The world was once Pangea.
[01:28:26.689 --> 01:28:26.889]  Okay?
[01:28:26.889 --> 01:28:29.351]  We were all one big conglomerate.
[01:28:29.351 --> 01:28:32.333]  The Earth is really like a living entity.
[01:28:32.333 --> 01:28:34.175]  And yes, the climate is going to change.
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:44.162]  I mean, is there anybody out there that is really, uh, I guess naive enough to believe that there was a huge culture in the middle of the desert?
[01:28:44.162 --> 01:28:46.263]  Mainly, uh, you know, the pyramids in Egypt?
[01:28:46.263 --> 01:28:48.383]  No, those people couldn't have lived in a desert.
[01:28:48.383 --> 01:28:49.844]  There had to be an irrigation system.
[01:28:49.844 --> 01:28:52.384]  There had to be a way for them to get food and water.
[01:28:52.384 --> 01:28:55.265]  You know, there had to be wildlife that they could eat.
[01:28:55.265 --> 01:29:01.667]  So, you know, that desertification probably happened well after those pyramids were built.
[01:29:01.667 --> 01:29:03.227]  You know, and that society had to leave.
[01:29:03.786 --> 01:29:06.267]  For the most part, because it's a desert!
[01:29:06.267 --> 01:29:11.308]  So, the climate and the earth are always going to change.
[01:29:11.308 --> 01:29:25.132]  You know, it's going to be a gradual change, but unfortunately, the elite are trying to play off of our fears, not only to get us behind global warming, but to get us behind a carbon tax, and have you buy carbon credits.
[01:29:25.132 --> 01:29:31.774]  And what that means is, you're going to be taxed on how many cars you have, and how big your house is.
[01:29:32.438 --> 01:29:34.841]  And how much energy you use.
[01:29:34.841 --> 01:29:39.005]  And if you use too much, oh, you gotta pay a little bit more.
[01:29:39.005 --> 01:29:41.468]  But they won't go after the big corporations.
[01:29:41.468 --> 01:29:44.971]  They'll still get the same kickbacks.
[01:29:44.971 --> 01:29:48.015]  You know, they'll be able to invest their money in slush funds.
[01:29:48.015 --> 01:29:50.137]  And they'll never be regulated.
[01:29:50.137 --> 01:29:51.238]  They'll never be regulated.
[01:29:51.238 --> 01:29:52.319]  They'll pollute all the way.
[01:29:52.319 --> 01:29:53.961]  The real pollution will continue.
[01:29:54.730 --> 01:29:57.232]  Because, yeah, is our water polluted?
[01:29:57.232 --> 01:29:57.772]  You bet it is.
[01:29:57.772 --> 01:30:00.094]  They're putting all sorts of garbage in there.
[01:30:00.094 --> 01:30:02.195]  I mean, the mercury is high in the water.
[01:30:02.195 --> 01:30:03.797]  They're putting more fluoride than ever.
[01:30:03.797 --> 01:30:08.760]  They've found remnants of Prozac and all these other pharmaceuticals in the drinking water.
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:10.462]  It's nuts!
[01:30:10.462 --> 01:30:12.843]  So, yeah, there is pollution.
[01:30:12.843 --> 01:30:21.990]  You know, I like to think of myself not as a total environmentalist, but I'm not for people, you know, dumping toxins in the water.
[01:30:22.810 --> 01:30:25.351]  You know, obviously, progress has to keep going.
[01:30:25.351 --> 01:30:26.972]  You know, we still have to build roads.
[01:30:26.972 --> 01:30:31.715]  I'm not one of these kids who says, oh, you can't take down the forest.
[01:30:31.715 --> 01:30:33.075]  Oh, we can't do that.
[01:30:33.075 --> 01:30:35.617]  The hummingbird is there, this really real hummingbird.
[01:30:35.617 --> 01:30:36.677]  No.
[01:30:36.677 --> 01:30:38.939]  But when you're poisoned in the water, yeah, it's time to stop.
[01:30:38.939 --> 01:30:42.000]  Global warming, it's nonsense, folks.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.441]  We'll take your call for the next segment.
[01:30:43.441 --> 01:30:44.722]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:30:44.722 --> 01:30:47.143]  I am Jason Bermas, InfoWars.com.
[01:30:56.829 --> 01:31:00.892]  Gentlemen, I know you need no reminder that Valentine's Day is right around the corner.
[01:31:00.892 --> 01:31:03.313]  Obviously, you have the perfect gift in mind.
[01:31:03.313 --> 01:31:09.877]  Well, just in case you might, ahem, know someone that may need some gift ideas, tell them about EnduringRose.com.
[01:31:09.877 --> 01:31:12.359]  We all know that flowers are a woman's favorite gift.
[01:31:12.719 --> 01:31:14.581]  But they only last a short time.
[01:31:14.581 --> 01:31:19.745]  EnduringRose.com has taken this gift and made it into one that will endure and last forever.
[01:31:19.745 --> 01:31:26.671]  Dipped in 24 karat gold, these real roses, single rose, or bouquets preserve your message of love for a lifetime.

[01:31:42.845 --> 01:31:45.987]  E-N-D-U-R-I-N-G Rose dot com.
[01:31:45.987 --> 01:31:46.387]  Or call 702-453-7455.
[01:31:46.387 --> 01:31:46.707]  That's 702-453-7455.
[01:31:55.129 --> 01:31:56.930]  The headlines are clear.
[01:31:56.930 --> 01:31:59.852]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[01:31:59.852 --> 01:32:03.053]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[01:32:03.053 --> 01:32:04.814]  The mark of the beast is at hand.
[01:32:04.814 --> 01:32:08.116]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[01:32:08.116 --> 01:32:10.877]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope.
[01:32:10.877 --> 01:32:11.778]  To stay free.
[01:32:12.798 --> 01:32:16.442]  Now, Survival of Seeds introduces their Escape the Beast Kit.
[01:32:16.442 --> 01:32:19.805]  24 varieties of all-natural, non-genetically modified heirloom seeds.
[01:32:19.805 --> 01:32:22.688]  For true patriots and homesteaders wanting food insurance.
[01:32:22.688 --> 01:32:27.313]  That's over five pounds of rare historic seeds for a penny per seed.
[01:32:27.313 --> 01:32:30.436]  15,000 seeds that will feed a family healthy food for seven years.
[01:32:30.436 --> 01:32:31.237]  Big John Lipscomb.
[01:32:31.277 --> 01:32:41.121]  A post of Don't Tread on Me is including an instructional DVD that will teach you how to earn big money selling the produce from his incredible heirloom seeds back to him, restaurants and small delis.
[01:32:41.121 --> 01:32:42.502]  Don't buy from Copycats.
[01:32:42.502 --> 01:32:44.623]  Their fancy packaging is not free.
[01:32:44.623 --> 01:32:46.604]  Order today before it's too late.
[01:32:46.604 --> 01:32:48.465]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:32:48.465 --> 01:32:50.806]  That's SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:32:50.806 --> 01:32:52.707]  A long-term food solution.
[01:32:55.959 --> 01:32:59.221]  Do you want to pay for the government bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?
[01:32:59.221 --> 01:33:01.182]  You may have no choice.
[01:33:01.182 --> 01:33:04.384]  Obviously, taxpayers are on the hook for over $6 trillion.
[01:33:04.384 --> 01:33:08.946]  That's right, trillion dollars in mortgages held by these two corporations.
[01:33:08.946 --> 01:33:14.909]  The part that most people don't realize is that this bailout can have significant adverse effects on their 401ks and IRAs.
[01:33:16.539 --> 01:33:21.740]  Unless you're planning to help pay for this bailout with your personal retirement funds, you need to act now.
[01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:25.621]  The solution is to fund a self-directed IRA with gold and silver.
[01:33:25.621 --> 01:33:29.602]  Put your retirement money beyond the reach of government financiers today by calling 1-866-323-5665.
[01:33:29.602 --> 01:33:31.523]  SafeGrow IRAs are just a phone call away.
[01:33:37.916 --> 01:33:40.257]  That's 1-866-323-5665.
[01:33:40.257 --> 01:33:44.318]  Microgym at Midas Resources can help you protect your retirement nest egg.
[01:33:44.318 --> 01:33:49.260]  Get informed and ask for our free report on the unseen fallout of the Fannie Freddie rescue.
[01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:49.580]  Call 1-866-323-5665.
[01:33:55.305 --> 01:33:56.205]  You worry.
[01:33:56.205 --> 01:33:58.266]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:33:58.266 --> 01:34:00.926]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:34:00.926 --> 01:34:03.047]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[01:34:03.047 --> 01:34:04.647]  Your answer may be at hand.
[01:34:04.647 --> 01:34:08.248]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[01:34:08.248 --> 01:34:13.489]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:34:13.489 --> 01:34:17.449]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:34:17.449 --> 01:34:19.130]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:34:19.130 --> 01:34:22.050]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[01:34:22.050 --> 01:34:24.971]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:34:25.495 --> 01:34:34.142]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[01:34:34.142 --> 01:34:38.965]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[01:34:38.965 --> 01:34:42.988]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.

[01:34:48.813 --> 01:34:52.215]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:34:52.215 --> 01:34:54.237]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[01:34:57.506 --> 01:35:02.430]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:35:02.430 --> 01:35:06.774]  It's about right versus left.
[01:35:06.774 --> 01:35:09.596]  It's about right versus wrong.
[01:35:09.596 --> 01:35:12.178]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:35:12.178 --> 01:35:13.439]  Call Alex now at 1-877-590-5525.
[01:35:13.439 --> 01:35:14.280]  Now, here's Alex Jones.
[01:35:21.949 --> 01:35:25.850]  And no, the right and the left is really how they keep most people in the dark.
[01:35:25.850 --> 01:35:31.591]  You know, most people saw this administration, they thought, oh, it's the right wing that's doing this to us.
[01:35:31.591 --> 01:35:39.653]  So when the right wing tells you that global warming is a myth, people automatically think, oh, they must be lying, you know, because they've lied about everything else.
[01:35:39.653 --> 01:35:43.354]  But in fact, you know, they're like, oh, well, big oil, of course, is on their side.
[01:35:43.354 --> 01:35:45.015]  They're lobbying for them.
[01:35:45.015 --> 01:35:50.576]  Well, in fact, both sides do tell you a little bit of truth, but they oppose each other and they make the truth
[01:35:51.192 --> 01:36:01.982]  Seems so absurd and obscene that only somebody who was on the right wing and a supporter of big oil would ever believe that global warming wasn't real, right?
[01:36:01.982 --> 01:36:08.608]  Why don't we just play the first five minutes of the Great Global Warming Swindle and let you guys decide for yourself.
[01:36:08.608 --> 01:36:10.911]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:36:10.911 --> 01:36:13.893]  We've done articles about it, but let's play it on the radio.
[01:36:13.893 --> 01:36:14.494]  Let's do it.
[01:36:14.494 --> 01:36:15.375]  Great Global Warming Swindle.
[01:36:17.324 --> 01:36:20.807]  When people say, we don't believe in global warming, I say, no, I believe in global warming.
[01:36:20.807 --> 01:36:24.249]  I don't believe that human CO2 is causing that warming.
[01:36:24.249 --> 01:36:27.211]  A few years ago, if you would ask me, I would tell you it's CO2.
[01:36:27.211 --> 01:36:27.491]  Why?
[01:36:27.491 --> 01:36:34.156]  Because just like everyone else in the public, I listened to what the media had to say.
[01:36:34.156 --> 01:36:39.180]  Each day, the news reports grow more fantastically apocalyptic.
[01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:43.222]  Politicians no longer dare to express any doubt about climate change.
[01:36:43.222 --> 01:36:45.144]  There is such intolerance.
[01:36:46.155 --> 01:36:48.156]  Of any dissenting voice.
[01:36:48.156 --> 01:36:51.876]  Are some of the worst climate criminals on the planet.
[01:36:51.876 --> 01:36:59.578]  This is the most politically incorrect thing possible, is to doubt this climate change orthodoxy.
[01:36:59.578 --> 01:37:02.359]  Global warming has gone beyond politics.
[01:37:02.359 --> 01:37:04.639]  It is a new kind of morality.
[01:37:04.639 --> 01:37:10.761]  The Prime Minister is back from his holidays, unrepentant and unembarrassed about yet another long-haul destination.
[01:37:13.428 --> 01:37:23.951]  Yet, as the frenzy over man-made global warming grows shriller, many senior climate scientists say the actual scientific basis for the theory is crumbling.
[01:37:23.951 --> 01:37:31.453]  There were periods, for example, in Earth's history when we had three times as much CO2 as we have today, or periods when we had ten times as much CO2 as we have today.
[01:37:31.453 --> 01:37:36.475]  And if CO2 has a large effect on climate, then you should see it in the temperature reconstruction.
[01:37:37.953 --> 01:37:44.097]  If we look at climate through the geological time frame, we would never suspect CO2 as a major climate driver.
[01:37:44.097 --> 01:37:51.221]  None of the major climate changes in the last thousand years can be explained by CO2.
[01:37:51.221 --> 01:37:53.802]  We can't say that CO2 will drive climate.
[01:37:53.802 --> 01:37:57.684]  It certainly never did in the past.
[01:37:57.684 --> 01:38:05.529]  I've often heard it said that there is a consensus of thousands of scientists on the global warming issue and that humans are causing a catastrophic change to the climate system.
[01:38:06.633 --> 01:38:10.716]  Well, I am one scientist, and there are many that simply think that is not true.
[01:38:10.716 --> 01:38:14.239]  Man-made global warming is no ordinary scientific theory.
[01:38:14.239 --> 01:38:22.586]  This morning, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change made up of... It is presented in the media as having the stamp of authority of an impressive international organization.
[01:38:22.586 --> 01:38:28.872]  ...from the IPCC... The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.
[01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:33.503]  The IPCC, like any UN body, is political.
[01:38:33.503 --> 01:38:37.187]  The final conclusions are politically driven.
[01:38:37.187 --> 01:38:41.791]  This claim that the IPCC is the world's top 1,500 or 2,500 scientists
[01:38:46.129 --> 01:38:49.191]  You look at the bibliographies of the people and it's simply not true.
[01:38:49.191 --> 01:38:51.932]  There are quite a number of non-scientists.
[01:38:51.932 --> 01:39:01.077]  And to build the number up to 2,500 they have to start taking reviewers and government people and so on, anyone who ever came close to them.
[01:39:01.077 --> 01:39:04.199]  And none of them are asked to agree.
[01:39:04.199 --> 01:39:05.960]  Many of them disagree.
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:10.082]  Those people who are specialists but don't agree with the polemic
[01:39:10.905 --> 01:39:11.826]  Alright, let's pull it right there.
[01:39:36.983 --> 01:39:54.832]  And it is pure propaganda and I encourage people to go check that out on the web or get a hard copy of it because it's instrumental in showing the trends of climate change on the earth, you know, prior to us being blamed for too much CO2.
[01:39:54.832 --> 01:40:00.895]  Like the guy said, you know, there were times on the earth that CO2 was three times as prevalent and ten times as prevalent.
[01:40:00.895 --> 01:40:04.577]  Yet the trends don't show that the heat wave went up.
[01:40:04.577 --> 01:40:06.538]  The truth is that the sun is heating up
[01:40:07.225 --> 01:40:15.027]  Uh, it's got a lot more sunspots going on, and overall, you know, in certain regions, the temperature's going up.
[01:40:15.027 --> 01:40:15.727]  You're gonna have it.
[01:40:15.727 --> 01:40:17.387]  It's, it's, it's cyclic.
[01:40:17.387 --> 01:40:21.068]  It's real climate change from nature.
[01:40:21.068 --> 01:40:22.448]  Nature!
[01:40:22.448 --> 01:40:32.510]  What a, what a, uh, huge concept that nature really still exists, and, um, you know, it has a draw on our lives.
[01:40:32.510 --> 01:40:35.031]  That man doesn't control everything.
[01:40:35.655 --> 01:40:42.000]  I know there are some listeners out there that feel like, you know, people are using harp to control all the weather everywhere.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.041]  I'm not one of those guys.
[01:40:43.041 --> 01:40:45.943]  I mean, obviously, harp is an interesting thing to look into.
[01:40:45.943 --> 01:40:50.526]  I would say that it's definitely utilized in some cases.
[01:40:50.526 --> 01:40:54.289]  But the earth is nature's force.
[01:40:54.289 --> 01:41:02.375]  And I don't think we're going to be able to, you know, cool the earth or heat the earth through us spraying a can of hairspray.
[01:41:03.357 --> 01:41:07.562]  Or, you know, launching a bottle of WD-40 with a little CO2 in it.
[01:41:07.562 --> 01:41:09.925]  It's absolute nonsense.
[01:41:09.925 --> 01:41:15.451]  You know, the way that chlorofluorocarbons were demonized when I was a kid.
[01:41:15.451 --> 01:41:16.993]  I mean, I sat down in class...
[01:41:17.677 --> 01:41:21.840]  And we would watch documentary after documentary with celebrity after celebrity.
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:29.665]  The one that really struck me the most was the one with Whoopi Goldberg and Ted Danson and the guy who played Vinnie Delpino on Doogie Howser.
[01:41:29.665 --> 01:41:31.366]  They're all telling me, oh no!
[01:41:31.366 --> 01:41:33.927]  And this is when I'm like 10 years old.
[01:41:33.927 --> 01:41:39.491]  In 15 years, you're not going to be able to go outside unless you have a hazmat suit on.
[01:41:39.491 --> 01:41:40.992]  I mean, I'm literally watching this stuff.
[01:41:41.826 --> 01:41:51.828]  You know, and they're encouraging you, oh, you've got to stop behaving this way, and we've got to go after people, and people have to be responsible for how, for their carbon footprint.
[01:41:51.828 --> 01:41:56.869]  And now ABC has a, what was it, abcsplanetslayer.com or something?
[01:41:56.869 --> 01:41:59.670]  They had a little cartoon pig for your kids.
[01:41:59.670 --> 01:42:06.851]  And it showed that the pig and, uh, I think another farm animal gave up less, uh,
[01:42:08.211 --> 01:42:14.857]  Less of a carbon footprint, and that really your allotted amount of carbon, you should be dead at one and a half.
[01:42:14.857 --> 01:42:16.318]  About 18 months.
[01:42:16.318 --> 01:42:18.680]  That should be your allotted carbon footprint.
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:20.662]  And there's blood on it, spattered over.
[01:42:20.662 --> 01:42:24.005]  Just type in, you know, ABC News Carbon Footprint.
[01:42:24.005 --> 01:42:28.488]  I'm sure you'll get the Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.tv article.
[01:42:28.488 --> 01:42:33.733]  And that's disgusting to me because, you know, first of all, my little sister, who's
[01:42:35.206 --> 01:42:36.427]  Uh, 13 years old.
[01:42:36.427 --> 01:42:37.508]  She's on the web.
[01:42:37.508 --> 01:42:39.249]  You know, she's been on the web for years.
[01:42:39.249 --> 01:42:45.013]  Uh, I would say that most of her entertainment is now coming from the web and not so much television.
[01:42:45.013 --> 01:42:46.854]  And she sees things like this.
[01:42:46.854 --> 01:42:58.102]  And now I have a four-year-old niece who, amazingly enough, she's very well-spoken, she's very web-savvy, and she's on these websites, you know, playing Dora the Explorer or whatever.
[01:42:58.102 --> 01:43:01.404]  And she's subject to these same modes of propaganda.
[01:43:02.119 --> 01:43:18.692]  I would hate to have to explain to my four-year-old niece why she should have been blown up two and a half years ago in a pig box, because she used her allotted amount of carbon credits.
[01:43:18.692 --> 01:43:21.814]  And Lord knows if that's where we'll reach at one point.
[01:43:21.814 --> 01:43:22.114]  Who knows?
[01:43:22.114 --> 01:43:24.756]  Maybe we won't even have to pay a carbon tax at one point.
[01:43:24.756 --> 01:43:31.902]  You'll be allotted a lot of the number of carbon credits throughout your lifetime, and then when you use those carbon credits, you'll be exterminated.
[01:43:32.608 --> 01:43:34.410]  It'll be like Logan's Run.
[01:43:34.410 --> 01:43:36.111]  That's what we're headed towards.
[01:43:36.111 --> 01:43:37.352]  You know?
[01:43:37.352 --> 01:43:43.677]  They've been soft-killing us for years with the vaccinations and their little backdoor eugenics programs.
[01:43:43.677 --> 01:43:45.999]  I'm here to tell you folks, the Nazis never really lost.
[01:43:45.999 --> 01:43:47.200]  They relocated here.
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:48.041]  Okay?
[01:43:48.041 --> 01:43:49.342]  Project Paperclip.
[01:43:49.342 --> 01:43:50.723]  Look into it.
[01:43:50.723 --> 01:43:53.385]  We harnessed many a Nazi scientist.
[01:43:53.385 --> 01:43:58.950]  We brought him into our intelligence organizations, our space programs, our
[01:43:59.494 --> 01:44:03.457]  CIA, backdoor programs, OSS and the CIA.
[01:44:03.457 --> 01:44:06.619]  They're the ones that are behind things like MKUltra.
[01:44:06.619 --> 01:44:15.425]  By the way, there are a bunch of Vietnam vets in the news this week suing over the mind control programs that the government put them through.
[01:44:15.425 --> 01:44:16.125]  Okay?
[01:44:16.125 --> 01:44:17.966]  So, you don't believe in MKUltra?
[01:44:17.966 --> 01:44:19.387]  Oh, really?
[01:44:19.387 --> 01:44:23.510]  Well, there's only all these declassified documents and then the serious documents got destroyed.
[01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:25.592]  They only had hearings in Congress.
[01:44:25.592 --> 01:44:26.652]  But it doesn't exist.
[01:44:26.652 --> 01:44:27.633]  The government would never hurt us.
[01:44:28.424 --> 01:44:34.491]  The Tuskegee experiments, where they gave black pilots syphilis just to see what it would do.
[01:44:34.491 --> 01:44:37.474]  Well, that's the stuff that's public, okay?
[01:44:37.474 --> 01:44:41.418]  And there are a lot of backdoor things that we still do not know about.
[01:44:41.418 --> 01:44:45.343]  I hate to tell you, but Paperclip has not been fully declassified.
[01:44:45.343 --> 01:44:48.967]  Most of the most disgusting things are probably hidden from the public.
[01:44:49.804 --> 01:44:50.344]  Not probably.
[01:44:50.344 --> 01:44:51.785]  They are hidden from the public.
[01:44:51.785 --> 01:44:55.026]  You know, the Nazis just did everything out in the open.
[01:44:55.026 --> 01:45:03.709]  And then when they had their trials, they pointed to institutes like the Carnegie Institute and the Rockefellers saying, well, we were just trying to clean up the population like you had said.
[01:45:03.709 --> 01:45:06.130]  We were just following your model.
[01:45:06.130 --> 01:45:09.692]  Well, that model is still here and alive and well.
[01:45:09.692 --> 01:45:15.974]  And, you know, I'm not a huge Reverend Wright fan, you know, who was ostracized by the Obama campaign.
[01:45:15.974 --> 01:45:18.415]  The moment he spoke a little bit of truth in the media,
[01:45:19.958 --> 01:45:24.923]  But he's dead on when he talks about HIV being a bioweapon.
[01:45:24.923 --> 01:45:25.885]  Come on.
[01:45:25.885 --> 01:45:27.506]  Really?
[01:45:27.506 --> 01:45:28.507]  You don't know?
[01:45:28.507 --> 01:45:29.268]  Check it out.
[01:45:29.268 --> 01:45:31.150]  Just look at the history of it.
