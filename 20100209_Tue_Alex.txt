[01:00.800 --> 01:05.880]  not widely known that the majority of EPA scientists and toxicologists sent a
[01:05.880 --> 01:10.480]  petition several years ago to their own bosses at the Environmental Protection
[01:10.480 --> 01:17.280]  Agency pointing out just how deadly fluoride is and when you hear the term
[01:17.280 --> 01:21.280]  fluoride on average it's over 150 chemicals they add to the water some
[01:21.280 --> 01:26.880]  cities over 300 and I know most the audience already knows this but your
[01:26.880 --> 01:30.920]  neighbors don't they just think oh that's what cooks say well you're gonna
[01:30.920 --> 01:36.360]  hear this from a top EPA scientist coming up ladies and gentlemen and then of

[01:51.000 --> 01:53.800]  just mention some of what's in the first stack and then I'll go through this in
[01:53.800 --> 01:59.440]  detail coming up in the hour exposed naked body scanner images of film star
[01:59.440 --> 02:03.960]  printed and circulated by airport staff they don't only record your genitals
[02:03.960 --> 02:09.280]  they share them and I've talked to tons of media witnesses reporters that have
[02:09.280 --> 02:13.200]  seen good-looking women get ushered in they laugh they stare they enjoy they
[02:13.200 --> 02:17.200]  record they save of course they're recording and all it's a biometric body
[02:17.200 --> 02:23.360]  scan it's not just a weapon screener and so we'll be breaking that down this is
[02:23.360 --> 02:27.920]  huge news authorities claim that virtual strip search pictures immediately
[02:27.920 --> 02:34.600]  destroyed proven fraudulent use of devices needs to be halted now just like
[02:34.600 --> 02:37.960]  oh they told you 14 years ago when I was exposing it we're not taking your
[02:37.960 --> 02:43.720]  babies blood for DNA databases and now they say oh Alex Jones is right 37 years
[02:43.720 --> 02:52.120]  worldwide in every western country we take it for the UN I mean they don't
[02:52.120 --> 02:55.400]  even take the blood from criminals but they will take it from you oh they will
[02:55.400 --> 03:01.200]  oh they will Rasmussen poll and I'll guarantee it's even higher than this
[03:01.200 --> 03:03.800]  because most people when you call them and say do you hate the government a
[03:03.800 --> 03:10.240]  lot of them get scared and say oh no I love it oh I like it but 75% are angry
[03:10.240 --> 03:15.120]  at government's current policies so knowing the science of polls I'd say
[03:15.120 --> 03:22.120]  it's more like 90% 95% but don't worry the government wants to get control of
[03:22.120 --> 03:25.760]  the Internet now we can't have all this dissent we can't have the slaves talking

[09:49.960 --> 09:54.920]  censorship by ISPs and governments intensifying around the world the
[09:54.920 --> 10:00.560]  draconian cyber security bill takeover and Sarah Palin saying along with all
[10:00.560 --> 10:05.920]  the big neocons another editorial today play the war card national reviews
[10:05.920 --> 10:10.920]  saying launch an attack on Iran that'll get your approval rating up Obama they
[10:10.920 --> 10:15.600]  want him to continue the neocon agenda that runs his white house his approval
[10:15.600 --> 10:20.200]  rating is plunging and plunging and plunging and plunging and plunging and
[10:20.200 --> 10:23.840]  plunging and he will no doubt have the lowest approval rating of any president
[10:23.840 --> 10:28.840]  modern history including Richard Nixon within six months at the current slide
[10:28.840 --> 10:38.680]  rate the problem is the establishment has Mitt Romney the neocon and Sarah
[10:38.680 --> 10:44.400]  new Kyran Palin flapping around waiting in the wings Huckabee says he absolutely
[10:44.400 --> 10:50.640]  backs the drive to bomb Iran doesn't matter that the public is been bamboozled
[10:50.640 --> 10:56.440]  on this just like they've been manipulated with Iraq with WMD's remember
[10:56.440 --> 11:01.640]  six months ago or so Iran it was all over the news oh my gosh secret nuke
[11:01.640 --> 11:06.800]  facility then you read the fine print that they were reporting to the UN six
[11:06.800 --> 11:10.800]  months before six to eight months under the regulations that they're under
[11:10.800 --> 11:13.840]  they're under global government like everybody else that they were going to
[11:13.840 --> 11:17.200]  start enrichment in six months it was not a secret facility and they've now
[11:17.200 --> 11:20.920]  asked the UN to come into their other facilities and oversee the fact that
[11:20.920 --> 11:27.040]  it's not anywhere near weapons grade doesn't matter our media says Iran must
[11:27.040 --> 11:32.120]  be attacked now and they'll stage some nice terror attacks here in the United
[11:32.120 --> 11:35.680]  States Iran will probably actually stage some real ones you know in the in
[11:35.680 --> 11:39.640]  response and then they get to shut down the internet and free speech and all
[11:39.640 --> 11:42.640]  the rest of it and they're certainly gearing up for that right now with their
[11:42.640 --> 11:48.200]  council of governors cyber security and the whole other nine yards so the toll

[12:46.600 --> 12:56.360]  dehumanization and tyranny John McCain says the Tea Party movement is racist
[12:56.360 --> 13:02.400]  that's right in info wars dot com story by Curt Nimo according to Megan McCain
[13:02.400 --> 13:08.080]  daughter of John McCain the Tea Party is chock full of racist McCain's daughter
[13:08.080 --> 13:13.560]  Tea Party movement is racist once again appearing on the view McCain slammed the
[13:13.560 --> 13:22.440]  Tea Party movement said young people are turned off by its innate racism and she
[13:22.440 --> 13:32.760]  is of course parroting what Jimmy Carter and Carlos Watson and Chris Matthews and
[13:32.760 --> 13:37.400]  others including Keith Oberman say oh you don't want bigger government you don't
[13:37.400 --> 13:43.320]  want government health care racist and that's actually the true racism invoking
[13:43.320 --> 13:51.760]  race making everything a racial issue and attacking Palin which then Americans
[13:51.760 --> 13:55.920]  will see this as fraudulent and then support Palin because oh my gosh the
[13:55.920 --> 14:01.040]  discredited establishment liberals are attacking her she must be good kind of
[14:01.040 --> 14:05.960]  like Europe signed on to the carbon taxes because the idiot George Bush was
[14:05.960 --> 14:09.240]  against it but then at the key moment he flipped flopped in his last year in
[14:09.240 --> 14:12.080]  office as we told you months before he would when we got the intel at
[14:12.080 --> 14:17.920]  Bilderberg and Greece that Bush was going to go for it then you saw all the
[14:17.920 --> 14:22.720]  fortune 500 get behind it the NFL all the major sitcoms and news course
[14:22.720 --> 14:31.400]  holdings in TV entertainment and newspapers so this is the establishment
[14:31.400 --> 14:40.520]  agenda that is moving forward let me get into this news item first though if you
[14:40.520 --> 14:45.200]  read what the United Nations has proposed and if you read what England is
[14:45.200 --> 14:48.800]  moving forward with and what Europe is moving forward with and what the US is
[14:48.800 --> 14:53.920]  even beginning to propose they state that there will be no over-the-counter
[14:53.920 --> 15:02.840]  fish oil vitamin C aloe vera they like to start out by demonizing things like
[15:02.840 --> 15:09.800]  colloidal silver or oil of oregano and sometimes there'll be of tens of
[15:09.800 --> 15:14.600]  thousands of supplements some particular type of bark or root that you have you
[15:14.600 --> 15:19.160]  a whole bottle of it can make you have a heart attack so can aspirin for that
[15:19.160 --> 15:24.600]  matter and so they sell it like oh my gosh you know look this guy was taking
[15:24.600 --> 15:29.080]  caffeine pills and had a heart attack a truck driver oh my gosh we've got to ban
[15:29.080 --> 15:38.960]  it but the truth is there are incredible treatments and cures on record with so
[15:38.960 --> 15:44.560]  many mainline supplements and the globalist can't patent it but in the last
[15:44.560 --> 15:49.920]  few decades and really the last six seven years it's been accelerating they
[15:49.920 --> 15:54.240]  have been allowed to get patents drug patents they've changed the rules on
[15:54.240 --> 16:00.680]  fish oil on vitamin C on a host of other you know incredible super nutrients
[16:00.680 --> 16:05.200]  and so what's happening is people go to see their medical doctors now who want
[16:05.200 --> 16:09.720]  to be able to prescribe this because it really is good but it costs a hundred
[16:09.720 --> 16:12.920]  and forty bucks for a bottle of fish oil that would be twenty bucks at the
[16:12.920 --> 16:20.120]  store and so we have guest up here we read the codex element areas this
[16:20.120 --> 16:24.080]  private consortium through you in law we break down what they're doing and I
[16:24.080 --> 16:28.080]  get emails going they're not gonna ban vitamin C that's fear mongering they're
[16:28.080 --> 16:33.520]  not gonna ban over-the-counter fish oil and aloe vera that's never gonna happen
[16:33.520 --> 16:41.640]  come on man oh really without a law the regulators in Canada and the same things
[16:41.640 --> 16:46.400]  now happening in Germany and England are sending letters to health food stores to
[16:46.400 --> 16:53.960]  pharmacies to anybody that sells vitamins minerals nutrients and saying you
[16:53.960 --> 16:58.560]  will not do this or you are open to liability from us and here's the
[16:58.560 --> 17:02.920]  national post one of the biggest papers in Canada it's the national paper of
[17:02.920 --> 17:10.160]  Canada based out of Ottawa stop selling unlicensed natural health remedies
[17:10.160 --> 17:16.960]  pharmacy regulators it's kind of like Obama can't get the Senate to pass his
[17:16.960 --> 17:21.080]  greenhouse gas tax takeover home inspections youth brigades I mean it's
[17:21.080 --> 17:25.360]  we cover the bill from clips of C-span in fall the republic I mean you can't
[17:25.360 --> 17:29.040]  make up what's in this he just went ahead and today announced we're launching
[17:29.040 --> 17:35.880]  a new green agency it's over we don't care EPA we're doing it we're taxing
[17:35.880 --> 17:44.600]  scores of gases including carbon dioxide they just don't care well here it is
[17:44.600 --> 17:49.400]  stop selling and licensed natural health remedies pharmacy regulators makers of
[17:49.400 --> 17:53.240]  natural health products say they are bracing for widespread layoffs and
[17:53.240 --> 17:57.880]  millions of dollars in losses after Canada's pharmacy regulators issued a
[17:57.880 --> 18:03.320]  surprise directive recently urging drugist to stop selling unlicensed
[18:03.320 --> 18:09.360]  natural remedies the order affects thousands of herbal treatments
[18:09.360 --> 18:14.160]  multivitamins and other products most of them waiting for approval from

[18:18.600 --> 18:25.200]  health goods the natural association of pharmacy regulatory authorities says
[18:25.200 --> 18:30.240]  pharmacists cannot be assured the products are safe until they are granted a
[18:30.240 --> 18:34.800]  government license and should not sell them in those circumstances on their
[18:34.800 --> 18:40.040]  store shelves over-the-counter pharmacists are obliged to hold the health

[25:02.440 --> 25:06.480]  to federal government policy it has taken a sledgehammer to a finishing
[25:06.480 --> 25:11.240]  nail the group said it will create confusion for consumers it is the wrong
[25:11.240 --> 25:18.720]  thing to do and it goes on to say that they're going to start going after
[25:18.720 --> 25:25.800]  many body-selling vitamins or nutrients or alternative treatments you've only
[25:25.800 --> 25:31.040]  have the choice to have the chemotherapy if you have cancer you only have the

[25:35.160 --> 25:42.320]  want to again they're just building this box this vice grip these clamps around
[25:42.320 --> 25:51.800]  our throats and it's the same thing in the United States US government plans
[25:51.800 --> 25:56.920]  new climate service US president Barack Obama administration announced plans
[25:56.920 --> 26:04.640]  today for a new office handling climate change aiming to help businesses chart
[26:04.640 --> 26:09.920]  future plans as the nation shifts to a greener economy but it's not a greener
[26:09.920 --> 26:14.640]  economy it's a takeover of our economy where they can decide who can have a
[26:14.640 --> 26:17.680]  business and who can't just like when they took over the automakers they
[26:17.680 --> 26:21.240]  decided who could keep their dealership and who couldn't the winehouse did oh
[26:21.240 --> 26:25.360]  are they big contributors to the Democrats all they can stay open the first
[26:25.360 --> 26:31.280]  practical effect was the creation of a website climate.gov which came online
[26:31.280 --> 26:35.800]  Monday and brings together government resources on climate change for
[26:35.800 --> 26:42.320]  businesses scholars and the general public commerce secretary Gary Locke said
[26:42.320 --> 26:46.120]  the new climate service would help businesses on subjects such as wind
[26:46.120 --> 26:53.200]  power by providing data on wind patterns which they would need to expand the
[26:53.200 --> 26:57.040]  bottom line is this the better climate information the alternative energy
[26:57.040 --> 27:02.600]  companies have the more profitable they can be the more jobs they can create and
[27:02.600 --> 27:08.720]  the more that they can actually meet the energy demands of our country and
[27:08.720 --> 27:15.280]  indeed the world he told reporters yes not letting us have coal plants will
[27:15.280 --> 27:20.080]  certainly help our economy when China is firing up three or four of my week yes
[27:20.080 --> 27:23.040]  going in and adding new layers of bureaucracy and controlling everybody's
[27:23.040 --> 27:27.280]  lives all these new taxes 2.6 billion in three years in Austin alone that's
[27:27.280 --> 27:35.000]  awesome energy oh that'll certainly help the economy. Locke compared the
[27:35.000 --> 27:38.680]  initiative to the National Weather Service which he said had spurred a
[27:38.680 --> 27:41.920]  private industry of forecasters who benefit from the government data no
[27:41.920 --> 27:49.240]  this won't be scientific Doppler radar this will be the winehouse organizing
[27:49.240 --> 27:56.640]  more fraud just like the IPCC and the UN and this is the agreement from
[27:56.640 --> 28:00.240]  Copenhagen when they couldn't get the treaty they said the US England and the
[28:00.240 --> 28:05.360]  European Union will start collecting carbon data and we'll start the taxes
[28:05.360 --> 28:11.600]  and we'll pay it to the IMF and World Bank you can't get Congress to pass it
[28:11.600 --> 28:18.360]  so he'll just tell the EPA to start the taxes on carbon dioxide but when you
[28:18.360 --> 28:22.720]  hear it on the news it's oh Obama's got a plan for some new jobs for you it's
[28:22.720 --> 28:26.800]  gonna be a home inspection and your gas bill and your water bill and your
[28:26.800 --> 28:31.320]  gasoline bill are all gonna go up and there's gonna be all these new fines and
[28:31.320 --> 28:35.520]  fees on businesses and all these new green police they've got being dispatched
[28:35.520 --> 28:39.160]  all over the country we're gonna expect your farm and ranch and gonna tell you
[28:39.160 --> 28:43.800]  what you can and can't do it in that great and they're not just saying water
[28:43.800 --> 28:46.720]  above ground a puddle of water they're saying if you have any water below
[28:46.720 --> 28:49.600]  ground they're gonna regulate your property which almost everybody's got
[28:49.600 --> 28:54.280]  water below ground there's a water table everywhere
[28:56.480 --> 29:02.400]  it's incredible the climate service would bring together resources now
[29:02.400 --> 29:05.600]  spread throughout the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who's
[29:05.600 --> 29:09.640]  been caught in all the fraud along with NASA an agency that falls under the
[29:09.640 --> 29:12.920]  Commerce Department it will also have six regional offices across the country
[29:12.920 --> 29:17.480]  oh boy Locke said he expected that the climate service would be running before
[29:17.480 --> 29:21.800]  the start of 2011 a year from now or less than a year he said the
[29:21.800 --> 29:25.400]  administration would first consult with Congress although he did not believe any
[29:25.400 --> 29:30.600]  new legislation was needed yes you know they don't need any stinking
[29:30.600 --> 29:35.280]  legislation and like they already built the cyber security takeover system and
[29:35.280 --> 29:38.680]  now they pass it to the house or like they pass laws for warrantless wire
[29:38.680 --> 29:42.320]  tapping decades after they started it

[33:15.480 --> 33:25.360]  wars.com up and now he has on his front page a red link and the reason drugs
[33:25.360 --> 33:31.360]  is so important he's not only the number one alternative news blog website in
[33:31.360 --> 33:36.800]  the world every other news agency will now pick this up you know until about
[33:36.800 --> 33:40.840]  four years ago the New York Times was the main publication that everybody else
[33:40.840 --> 33:45.880]  decided what to report on from kind of set the agenda now it's the drudge
[33:45.880 --> 33:54.600]  report and I tell you I have saluted Matt Drudge he hasn't been perfect over
[33:54.600 --> 33:58.360]  the years but now when we go to the drudge report I've been saying this for
[33:58.360 --> 34:03.240]  the last year it's like it's prisonplanet.com or info wars.com every
[34:03.240 --> 34:07.040]  time the globalist call for world government he puts videos up of world
[34:07.040 --> 34:11.760]  leaders saying it and the mainstream news articles he talks about the police
[34:11.760 --> 34:18.840]  state troops on the streets the snatch and grab by US military at the G20 in
[34:18.840 --> 34:25.000]  Pittsburgh I mean it's it's really good he is totally shifted into an
[34:25.000 --> 34:30.120]  anti-New World Order position and this is exciting we are becoming the mainstream
[34:30.120 --> 34:35.480]  we are taking America back and I just want to salute Matt Drudge for what
[34:35.480 --> 34:40.640]  he's doing because this is big Watson at about 6 30 this morning knew I was
[34:40.640 --> 34:46.040]  already up because he saw me on the IM sending out sending out dispatches to my
[34:46.040 --> 34:50.280]  different webmasters of what I wanted written and posted and I collaborate
[34:50.280 --> 34:56.480]  every morning with Kurt and mainly with Paul Watson on points I want made and
[34:56.480 --> 35:00.960]  of course they always have their own analysis and breakdown and Watson said
[35:00.960 --> 35:04.160]  this is huge because we know they're recording it we know they're getting a
[35:04.160 --> 35:07.840]  biometric scan with the naked body scanners and we're going to beat these
[35:07.840 --> 35:14.320]  things together and drudge really hates the naked body scanners and so I want
[35:14.320 --> 35:18.760]  to bring Paul Watson up and then let him go we are seeing a traffic spike of
[35:18.760 --> 35:24.400]  biblical proportions right now from the drudge report exposed naked body scanner
[35:24.400 --> 35:29.800]  images of film star printed circulated by airport staff and I already had Watson
[35:29.800 --> 35:34.400]  coming up before showtime at 11 30 to talk about this briefly but now we've
[35:34.400 --> 35:40.720]  got this drudge red link folks drudge maybe once a week red link something I
[35:40.720 --> 35:46.960]  mean this is when he read link something it is going super Nova great job to
[35:46.960 --> 35:51.320]  everybody out there because once people know they're really recording this which
[35:51.320 --> 35:54.280]  they admit they're doing internally and government documents have come out we've
[35:54.280 --> 35:57.240]  written about that make sure that's all added Watson that the fact that three
[35:57.240 --> 35:59.720]  weeks ago they admitted they're actually recording it and that's being put in a
[35:59.720 --> 36:04.400]  database once the public knows this and once they understand it violates child
[36:04.400 --> 36:09.520]  porn laws worldwide we're going to beat these things together and so now Paul
[36:09.520 --> 36:13.120]  Watson with his powerful article that he's going to be beefing now that it's
[36:13.120 --> 36:16.360]  gone supernova he's already written three articles today talk about a work
[36:16.360 --> 36:23.040]  course a Clydesdale pulling giant wagons of coal to be thrown in the
[36:23.040 --> 36:28.880]  furnaces of liberty every day out of the black mine oh I love it Watson good to
[36:28.880 --> 36:36.840]  have you here with us well my Clydesdale is another huge torpedo attack on the
[36:36.840 --> 36:42.640]  enemy tell us about the article well I thought it would get big Alex I actually
[36:42.640 --> 36:46.680]  wrote it yesterday I wanted to release it earlier today to give it the best
[36:46.680 --> 36:54.160]  impact because only a week ago the UK transport secretary Lorda Donis
[36:54.160 --> 37:01.360]  promised guaranteed that these naked body scanner images were deleted
[37:01.360 --> 37:07.080]  instantly and also we were told we were promised that the person going through
[37:07.080 --> 37:12.080]  them couldn't be identified and of course this completely demolishes that as a
[37:12.080 --> 37:19.600]  total fraud because on a BBC chat show on Friday night and these comments were
[37:19.600 --> 37:25.560]  reported but the you know the gravity test of them wasn't understood this
[37:25.560 --> 37:31.320]  Indian film star said that he went through a naked body scanner that he
[37:31.320 --> 37:39.120]  throw and after a few minutes when he got through it he said that girls and I
[37:39.120 --> 37:44.600]  mean that can only mean airport security staff had printed out the images of his
[37:44.600 --> 37:49.240]  naked body because he said he thought they were handing him some forms to sign
[37:49.240 --> 37:54.960]  or something but they handed him the print out of the naked image of his body
[37:54.960 --> 37:59.600]  and he says it shows everything it shows the outline of your body and he said
[37:59.600 --> 38:05.120]  that you would be embarrassed if you're not well in doubt because obviously as
[38:05.120 --> 38:10.840]  we've reported before and as has been admitted in the light of the lies that
[38:10.840 --> 38:16.440]  it doesn't these body scammers scanner images show full details Chris detail
[38:16.440 --> 38:21.720]  with genitalia so these airport security staff at Heathrow were printing out the
[38:21.720 --> 38:26.280]  images of him handing them around and ogling them and these are the same
[38:26.280 --> 38:29.800]  people who are going to be dealing with the images of your naked children but
[38:29.800 --> 38:33.640]  that's been separately reported by our listeners and other journalists and on
[38:33.640 --> 38:39.320]  the news and you even see the photos of men smiling in mainstream photos and
[38:39.320 --> 38:43.480]  mainstream papers looking at good-looking women and they admittedly are
[38:43.480 --> 38:48.160]  always grabbing women's breast and and and humiliating them and having their
[38:48.160 --> 38:52.360]  way with them I mean this is this is incredible this is a way to make a
[38:52.360 --> 38:57.200]  submit to tyranny this is a way to break our resolve break our will they're
[38:57.200 --> 39:01.880]  recording our naked bodies it is a biometric scan add all of that to the
[39:01.880 --> 39:04.440]  bottom of the article Watson all the other great articles you've written
[39:04.440 --> 39:10.960]  because we can really educate millions of people today and again it's wonderful
[39:10.960 --> 39:14.880]  that drudge pick this up obviously millions would have already read it just
[39:14.880 --> 39:18.920]  from our readers and people that post and paste our stuff all over Facebook and
[39:18.920 --> 39:26.880]  Myspace and Twitter but expose naked body scammers naked body scanner images of
[39:26.880 --> 39:31.080]  film star printed circulated by airport staff and he just admits it on
[39:31.080 --> 39:37.280]  television and talks about how it's a big joke I mean this is amazing yeah what
[39:37.280 --> 39:42.000]  key about it is that if they get these things in the airport which they've got
[39:42.000 --> 39:46.960]  in certain airports already Australia just announced widespread introduction
[39:46.960 --> 39:51.680]  Obama's set aside hundreds of millions of dollars for their introduction in
[39:51.680 --> 39:55.840]  every major US airport if they get it in the airport they're gonna put it on the
[39:55.840 --> 40:01.200]  street and that's being admitted the home office has already proposed putting
[40:01.200 --> 40:06.920]  these body scanners scaled down version of it on the street who can you make your
[40:06.920 --> 40:12.120]  body as you walk past the lamp post Dutch authorities Dutch police have announced
[40:12.120 --> 40:17.520]  that they're gonna use mobile versions of this for quote mass scams on crowds at
[40:17.520 --> 40:22.880]  events such as football matches you know I was in Shanghai earlier this year and
[40:22.880 --> 40:27.480]  to get into any museum or there was even a place that was like a model of the
[40:27.480 --> 40:32.240]  city inside this building and he had to go in and scan your belongings like
[40:32.240 --> 40:36.840]  you're in an airport everything that's in the airport is coming to the street so
[40:36.840 --> 40:41.080]  this is why people need to get this article and show that it's the
[40:41.080 --> 40:45.560]  company already have we already have courthouses doing it here in the US
[40:45.560 --> 40:51.080]  exactly people think oh I can just avoid this by not playing I'm afraid not it's
[40:51.080 --> 40:55.440]  gonna be around the corner from where you live if you don't resist it now and by
[40:55.440 --> 40:59.840]  the way first the British government said you can opt for the pat down but
[40:59.840 --> 41:02.960]  now they're saying no you will go through the naked body scanner and
[41:02.960 --> 41:06.000]  everyone's going to go through it and we're gonna record your children and
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.760]  we're gonna break child porn laws because we're the government and we're
[41:08.760 --> 41:14.040]  God and if we can make illegal aliens above the law worldwide overflowing and
[41:14.040 --> 41:17.800]  overtaking the West to break down wages and to be a power block to vote against
[41:17.800 --> 41:21.280]  freedom then we can sure selectively enforce this and break our own laws
[41:21.280 --> 41:26.080]  they do whatever they want when they want Watson right and if you refuse you
[41:26.080 --> 41:30.200]  treat it like a terrorist you don't play now there's another article we put out
[41:30.200 --> 41:36.320]  today which is out of the Huffington Post where a woman has breast implants and we
[41:36.320 --> 41:40.160]  read all these ridiculous articles and they grow up their breasts they grow up
[41:40.160 --> 41:44.640]  their breasts that these editorials said oh it gives you more privacy than a
[41:44.640 --> 41:48.640]  pat down if there's anything in the least bit suspicious they grope you
[41:48.640 --> 41:58.120]  anyway and it shows colostomy bags breast implants everything not lunch in the
[41:58.120 --> 42:03.520]  radiation dangers which the interagency committee on radiation safety the
[42:03.520 --> 42:07.760]  biggest organization that studies this kind of thing in the world said that
[42:07.760 --> 42:11.480]  it's dangerous and pregnant women and children should not be made to go through
[42:11.480 --> 42:16.360]  it well Paul beef the article with the radiation danger with the child porn
[42:16.360 --> 42:21.880]  law information and more because we've got a chance to educate millions and
[42:21.880 --> 42:26.240]  millions of new people today with this and we're just so thankful that the
[42:26.240 --> 42:30.240]  listeners continue to take our articles and put them out of the four winds and
[42:30.240 --> 42:36.160]  again that's why Co until pro is coming out of the woodwork trying to demonize
[42:36.160 --> 42:41.200]  us with the activist community because they know if people imitate what we've
[42:41.200 --> 42:45.320]  done and really take action we can bring down this new world order it is not
[42:45.320 --> 42:49.960]  invincible no one literally 99% of the public do not want to go through these
[42:49.960 --> 42:56.200]  naked body scanners people do not want to be part of this tyranny and we need
[42:56.200 --> 43:00.640]  to really press this issue because if they can get away with this thing it
[43:00.640 --> 43:06.280]  was anything you know as I predicted on the 27th of this of December two days
[43:06.280 --> 43:09.560]  after the underwear bombing that that it would be a staged event of course it
[43:09.560 --> 43:14.400]  came out it was in the State Department under intelligence agency orders this is
[43:14.400 --> 43:18.080]  Detroit news ordered him to be allowed on the plane without passport or ID and
[43:18.080 --> 43:21.160]  some security official brought him on board and that's all come out and more
[43:21.160 --> 43:26.800]  and we pointed out on the 27th as well that next they're going to want chest
[43:26.800 --> 43:31.600]  x-rays for hidden bombs in the stomach or breast and now that's the London
[43:31.600 --> 43:35.000]  Telegraph the London Guardian the Associated Press they are going to set
[43:35.000 --> 43:39.400]  the precedent to radiate you I mean they already make the troops breathe du that
[43:39.400 --> 43:42.880]  kills them dead in a hammer in just a few years they already make the troops
[43:42.880 --> 43:46.160]  take experimental vaccines that kill them this is the new world orders
[43:46.160 --> 43:52.880]  religion killing you with soft kill weapons and down the road I've got an
[43:52.880 --> 43:59.000]  MSNBC article that is so nightmarish it makes me physically ill today it says
[43:59.000 --> 44:06.680]  9-1-1 health lawsuits raise credibility concerns so 9 9-11 health lawsuits
[44:06.680 --> 44:10.400]  raise credibility concerns AP investigation finds inconsistent claims
[44:10.400 --> 44:17.600]  about sickness from ground zero I mean seven years ago they had the Mayo
[44:17.600 --> 44:25.320]  Clinic they had all the other big clinics and just scores of them the big
[44:25.320 --> 44:31.080]  you know famous New York medical facilities Minnesota California Mount
[44:31.080 --> 44:35.040]  Sinai the list went on and on about how their lungs were filled with concrete
[44:35.040 --> 44:40.360]  pulverized glass and asbestos and mercury from the hundreds of thousands of
[44:40.360 --> 44:45.720]  mercury switch thermostats and computers because it was just atomized with with
[44:45.720 --> 44:50.800]  explosives the government said it was safe it came out that they knew it
[44:50.800 --> 44:55.880]  wasn't safe and lied to everybody that that's the EPA's own internal documents
[44:55.880 --> 45:00.880]  Christina Todd Whitman and now the AP comes out and says oh we've done an
[45:00.880 --> 45:04.960]  investigation this is all fake none of these firefighters and police and
[45:04.960 --> 45:09.880]  medical workers are sick none of these National Guardsmen are really sick
[45:09.880 --> 45:14.680]  even though all within four years all the dogs that were there of hundreds
[45:14.680 --> 45:21.160]  died of cancer it's now 3000 plus of the medical people have died I mean are
[45:21.160 --> 45:24.440]  they faking dying I've been there with the firefighters and police when they
[45:24.440 --> 45:28.240]  go excuse me and they're sitting there with an oxygen tank and they can't even
[45:28.240 --> 45:31.080]  go on stage to give a speech to start coughing up blood and get put in an
[45:31.080 --> 45:35.720]  ambulance outside but no it's not real just like all these fake reports about
[45:35.720 --> 45:39.760]  this British doctor you know well the lands that took it out you know his
[45:39.760 --> 45:44.840]  findings of autism and mercury in the shots and he hasn't taken back what he
[45:44.840 --> 45:49.600]  said it's all a hoax they're hoaxing and saying vaccines aren't hurting you
[45:49.600 --> 45:56.800]  they're hoaxing and saying that the 9-11 heroes aren't sick and they're
[45:56.800 --> 46:01.880]  hoaxing and saying they're not recording your naked bodies Paul well I
[46:01.880 --> 46:07.600]  mean the AP did an investigation said the climate gate was no big deal they
[46:07.600 --> 46:11.960]  tried to squash it a couple weeks after it came out didn't work it completely
[46:11.960 --> 46:17.360]  blown out of all proportion now into a massive candle there's glacier gate
[46:17.360 --> 46:23.640]  there's afra gate there's Pachari gate there's every major government facility
[46:23.640 --> 46:28.240]  caught in internal memos organizing the fraud I mean fraud's coming out on a
[46:28.240 --> 46:32.960]  daily basis I exaggerate not folks bigger than the emails with the head UN
[46:32.960 --> 46:37.720]  scientists caught red-handed Ben Santer interviewed by Jesse Ventura admits
[46:37.720 --> 46:41.520]  they took out the five scientists in their 96 report saying man didn't
[46:41.520 --> 46:47.320]  contribute it's all fake but AP says no no no I've got the Economist magazine
[46:47.320 --> 46:53.680]  this week's issue saying it's all real Paul climate gates a hoax Paul it doesn't
[46:53.680 --> 46:58.680]  matter Paul but see no you guys are losing all your credibility that's why
[46:58.680 --> 47:01.960]  you can't get subscribers all these big news services are going to subscriber
[47:01.960 --> 47:07.680]  New York Daily News got 35 subscribers in three months no one likes you
[47:07.680 --> 47:13.680]  everyone knows your liars Watson well the more they act as apologists for all
[47:13.680 --> 47:18.120]  this the terror industrial complex the more credibility they lose as you said
[47:18.120 --> 47:22.840]  I mean time magazine jumping on the bandwagon with the internet licensing
[47:22.840 --> 47:28.760]  their subscription their street fell the way down the mainstream dinosaur dying
[47:28.760 --> 47:33.360]  and it's about time it happened now the people that will be left will be those
[47:33.360 --> 47:38.080]  that have at least given an avenue to the truth I mean to Roger understand
[47:38.080 --> 47:41.400]  that and that's why you post that stuff but that's not gonna happen they're
[47:41.400 --> 47:46.760]  gonna launch fake cyber attacks this is sure as the geese fly south in the
[47:46.760 --> 47:50.440]  winter just as sure as the sun comes up the morning and sets in the evening
[47:50.440 --> 47:54.240]  they're gonna wreck the web just as soon as their grids built and according to
[47:54.240 --> 47:58.000]  all the statistics I've seen internet to and the Pentagon separate grid they've
[47:58.000 --> 48:02.760]  built world-wide will be done in T-minus four months Watson that's what
[48:02.760 --> 48:08.560]  they're planning for I mean they've they've overreached again I mean internet
[48:08.560 --> 48:15.160]  licensing was rejected even by communist China yeah they just use filters but
[48:15.160 --> 48:20.920]  Microsoft the UN time magazine Newsweek and we've got links in this video the
[48:20.920 --> 48:24.520]  ten minute video we put out in the early morning hours today it's an
[48:24.520 --> 48:28.000]  excellent ten minute because it just every claim I say I show you their own
[48:28.000 --> 48:32.720]  articles where they are calling for registering and thumb printing to get
[48:32.720 --> 48:41.280]  online to use your iPhone anything and now everything everything buying and
[48:41.280 --> 48:44.560]  selling is on the web so that's the mark of the beast you've got a thumb
[48:44.560 --> 48:49.760]  print to buy and sell well it's amazing that in so-called democratic
[48:49.760 --> 48:54.880]  countries prison-planet and info was ascended far more than they are in
[48:54.880 --> 49:00.280]  communist China I've been China twice in the past two years and the prison-planet
[49:00.280 --> 49:05.480]  info they're available in China they're still available but not in New Zealand
[49:05.480 --> 49:10.120]  and occasionally you know ISP like Time Warner will knock us out for a while
[49:10.120 --> 49:15.960]  until people complain and it just shows them up to the authoritarian stooge is
[49:15.960 --> 49:21.760]  that they are well drudge knows the writing on the wall and he's choosing
[49:21.760 --> 49:26.920]  wisely because to all the police to all the military you got a choice okay and

[54:14.200 --> 54:21.000]  about two years ago we had Dr. William J. Hersey on he headed up an entire
[54:21.000 --> 54:25.000]  department of the EPA chemistry department chair at American University
[54:25.000 --> 54:29.760]  in Washington DC Dr. Hersey is a chemist and residents for the College of Arts
[54:29.760 --> 54:35.240]  and Science Chemistry Department he has a BS and PhD in chemistry from the
[54:35.240 --> 54:38.120]  University of Missouri in 2000 testified before the Senate subcommittee on
[54:38.120 --> 54:45.360]  wildlife fisheries and drinking water and the majority was over 90% of EPA
[54:45.360 --> 54:50.720]  scientists and toxicologists sent a letter a petition to the EPA they did it
[54:50.720 --> 54:54.760]  in 1999 and again in 2004 saying this is deadly poison which being put in the
[54:54.760 --> 54:58.800]  water and it's a cumulative toxin we have a problem though we were supposed to
[54:58.800 --> 55:02.320]  talk to him from the University today but they are literally in 12 feet of
[55:02.320 --> 55:08.280]  snow in DC as you know much of the eastern area of the country is is just
[55:08.280 --> 55:14.760]  buried right now and the university's closed but he may have come into the
[55:14.760 --> 55:18.280]  blizzard to do it if not he'll be on next week or something and I'm not glad
[55:18.280 --> 55:21.760]  this happened but I'm kind of glad because we got so much going on the
[55:21.760 --> 55:25.840]  naked body scanners recording your body saving it we have so much going on on
[55:25.840 --> 55:29.160]  the cybersecurity takeover and I want to take your calls but we'll see what
[55:29.160 --> 55:36.440]  happens with the good doctor Wayne Madsen's also in DC and yesterday we're
[55:36.440 --> 55:40.320]  trying to call him to double confirm he was on today and the phone was out for
[55:40.320 --> 55:44.920]  much of the day and he said because shell towers are collapsing they're down
[55:44.920 --> 55:50.040]  he's in DC too so who knows if he'll be on the day because of all this global
[55:50.040 --> 55:56.240]  warming this blizzard that they're that they're all under in DC right now oh my
[55:56.240 --> 55:59.760]  god and we see all these cases the last few months of people in Detroit you name
[55:59.760 --> 56:04.280]  it freezing to death when the government turns their power off under the
[56:04.280 --> 56:08.160]  climate taxes which will conservatively double your energy prices in the next
[56:08.160 --> 56:10.640]  five years it'll be even more freezing to death but I guess that makes the
[56:10.640 --> 56:16.640]  globalist happy even if they shut the web down ladies and gentlemen that's why

[58:53.640 --> 58:58.000]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[58:58.000 --> 59:02.160]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[59:02.160 --> 59:06.200]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[59:06.200 --> 59:10.080]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[59:10.080 --> 59:14.160]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[59:14.160 --> 59:18.520]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[59:18.520 --> 59:22.800]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[59:22.800 --> 59:26.520]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[59:26.520 --> 59:30.720]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[59:30.720 --> 59:34.080]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution
[59:34.080 --> 59:37.800]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[59:37.800 --> 59:43.320]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government

[1:00:12.280 --> 1:00:19.840]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.840 --> 1:00:23.320]  Alex Jones
[1:00:23.320 --> 1:00:51.680]  we're live ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us today and we're
[1:00:51.680 --> 1:00:57.160]  gonna be live here for a further three hours we are opening the phones up right
[1:00:57.160 --> 1:01:04.520]  now and then I'm going to blitz through masses of vital news and information
[1:01:04.520 --> 1:01:16.160]  today right now let's go ahead and go to your phone calls let's talk to Chris
[1:01:16.160 --> 1:01:23.320]  in Florida crusher on the air well Alex I woke up back in 1991 when I was on
[1:01:23.320 --> 1:01:27.960]  bullets and board systems and they were loosely networks and that's why I think
[1:01:27.960 --> 1:01:33.000]  we need to start getting back into is these networks that you know ultimately
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:37.160]  the information did come from the internet that woke me up but you know I
[1:01:37.160 --> 1:01:41.360]  woke up to things like the Federal Reserve and Ron Paul and other the
[1:01:41.360 --> 1:01:44.360]  congressmen have been trying for decades to end the Fed or the health
[1:01:44.360 --> 1:01:49.760]  tyranny or all these other things I started out becoming aware and actually
[1:01:49.760 --> 1:01:53.480]  going to Republican and Democrat campaign offices to present them with
[1:01:53.480 --> 1:01:57.240]  some of this information and the depth of the silence was deafening but I think
[1:01:57.240 --> 1:02:01.520]  you know as a backup as an auxiliary plan I know we want to keep the web but
[1:02:01.520 --> 1:02:06.240]  if the government knows that we're going over to these other networks and these
[1:02:06.240 --> 1:02:10.880]  other structures then maybe they'll think twice about you know playing a game
[1:02:10.880 --> 1:02:15.440]  of whack-a-mole with us I mean back then I put out the national listing of BBS
[1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:18.840]  is and then we'll have to put together a list of networks and bulletin board
[1:02:18.840 --> 1:02:24.440]  systems that we can call on the phone to access and back in 1996 when I stopped
[1:02:24.440 --> 1:02:29.480]  the listing it I ended up with over 330 I can just imagine if people were to go
[1:02:29.480 --> 1:02:33.160]  back to that now or if we were forced to but it'd be a lot better than the fax
[1:02:33.160 --> 1:02:36.680]  machines and and when it comes to Drudge I mean he's one of the people who helped
[1:02:36.680 --> 1:02:40.880]  wake me up to but you know he's again come full circle because he started
[1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:44.680]  becoming a propagandist and now he's coming back to your information so I
[1:02:44.680 --> 1:02:48.520]  want to congratulate you on that well sir I appreciate your call Chris let me
[1:02:48.520 --> 1:02:54.760]  let me break something down though here's the problem under cybersecurity all
[1:02:54.760 --> 1:03:02.480]  IT infrastructures by law must be wired in to the Pentagon and the 15 plus
[1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:07.520]  giant cybersecurity facilities they've built or are building okay I mean these
[1:03:07.520 --> 1:03:12.960]  are gigantic facilities Microsoft gets most of the big contracts I mean it's
[1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:18.800]  three billion dollar contract this year alone three billion just to administer it
[1:03:18.800 --> 1:03:24.040]  and that's only one layer of it they've got private groups it's all in there I'm
[1:03:24.040 --> 1:03:27.400]  gonna cover it coming up in the last hour today and so you're not gonna have
[1:03:27.400 --> 1:03:32.560]  your BBS systems they're gonna shut those down too we have to hold them we
[1:03:32.560 --> 1:03:36.280]  have to say no to their censorship and not just talk about ways around it
[1:03:36.280 --> 1:03:40.880]  separately we need to as well I agree with you Chris I've had a plan for
[1:03:40.880 --> 1:03:44.840]  several years I just can only implement so much here because of funding and
[1:03:44.840 --> 1:03:50.800]  other issues but I do plan and I encourage others to do it we're gonna
[1:03:50.800 --> 1:03:54.440]  have like a paper where we can send somebody a file or even mail them a file
[1:03:54.440 --> 1:03:59.720]  on a disk or whatever of a newspaper with our stories with places for you to
[1:03:59.720 --> 1:04:03.240]  put some of your stories locally if you want we'll give you different versions
[1:04:03.240 --> 1:04:07.800]  it'll have space for your ads our ads will be placed so you can just take it
[1:04:07.800 --> 1:04:14.680]  to a print shop and print the term tabloid doesn't mean like classic newspaper
[1:04:14.680 --> 1:04:20.600]  it means a sidefold sheet you understand so kind of a tabloid designed or or
[1:04:20.600 --> 1:04:26.360]  shape a smaller newspaper looks like a green sheets and I hope other people go
[1:04:26.360 --> 1:04:30.760]  out and do this I mean I don't I'm not here like hoarding my ideas it's mine
[1:04:30.760 --> 1:04:36.320]  no you know I don't want anybody to know until I do it launch it everybody
[1:04:36.320 --> 1:04:42.200]  launch it do it yourselves because you can have one with national news and then
[1:04:42.200 --> 1:04:45.360]  everybody can get it in their cities and towns have a section for local news and
[1:04:45.360 --> 1:04:49.360]  write about the new order in their area and it's gonna be devastating to the new
[1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:53.720]  world order it's gonna be devastating but it's gonna take capital probably five
[1:04:53.720 --> 1:04:58.240]  more people hired so we've got to continue to try to raise the war chest here
[1:04:58.240 --> 1:05:03.000]  so we can wage war on the new world order hello this is Alex Jones with some

[1:07:08.480 --> 1:07:12.800]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[1:07:12.800 --> 1:07:16.760]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[1:07:16.760 --> 1:07:21.120]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in

[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:25.920]  morning Alex I'm calling I'm calling today to talk about something that a
[1:12:25.920 --> 1:12:30.040]  friend and I who is a independent researcher along with me is finding
[1:12:30.040 --> 1:12:34.920]  here in central California that people need to start looking at sudden cardiac
[1:12:34.920 --> 1:12:41.360]  death sudden cardiac death is a diagnosis when doctors have no other idea why a
[1:12:41.360 --> 1:12:45.520]  heart stops well a lot of times when they taser a 14-year-old and they die of a
[1:12:45.520 --> 1:12:49.120]  heart attack they say the taser had nothing to do with it it was sudden
[1:12:49.120 --> 1:12:50.840]  cardiac death
[1:12:50.840 --> 1:12:56.480]  absolutely and what we're finding here in California is that healthy in shape
[1:12:56.480 --> 1:13:02.240]  athletes to high school students in the last 10 days have fallen over with
[1:13:02.240 --> 1:13:06.680]  sudden cardiac death and I'll tell you what a lot of it is it's a cocktail of
[1:13:06.680 --> 1:13:10.720]  toxins in our environment but a lot of the studies show this is on the rise
[1:13:10.720 --> 1:13:16.320]  everywhere because GMO foods are causing autoimmune responses in the
[1:13:16.320 --> 1:13:22.560]  ventricles of the heart and what we have done is we've set up a email account so
[1:13:22.560 --> 1:13:26.720]  that people can can write us and tell us when they hear of this kind of thing
[1:13:26.720 --> 1:13:31.800]  happening what we're looking for our newspaper articles what newspaper did
[1:13:31.800 --> 1:13:35.560]  you hear in or what television station because we can't do statistical
[1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:40.000]  we can also search engine it but go ahead and fire the email out the email is

[1:13:54.040 --> 1:13:57.560]  glad you called but and that's an interesting point you raise but I mean
[1:13:57.560 --> 1:14:01.000]  is anybody concerned about the cyber security passing the house is anybody
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.960]  concerned about all the new net censorship going on and all the calls for
[1:14:03.960 --> 1:14:07.400]  it by government industry is anybody concerned about the naked body scanners
[1:14:07.400 --> 1:14:12.640]  in your image is being saved is anybody concerned about the economy is anybody
[1:14:12.640 --> 1:14:17.400]  concerned about states passing laws that if you basically criticize the
[1:14:17.400 --> 1:14:24.440]  government you can be arrested I mean is anybody concerned about what's going on
[1:14:24.960 --> 1:14:30.200]  James in Indiana you're on the air hey Alex I want to thank you for all your
[1:14:30.200 --> 1:14:36.440]  hard work 2009 is a great year Obama deception is huge all the republic I
[1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:40.960]  just handed out two copies of it great stuff 20 minutes of the president all
[1:14:40.960 --> 1:14:44.400]  great stuff keep up the good work I really appreciate I know you're working a
[1:14:44.400 --> 1:14:50.320]  lot of hours I had three questions for you why are the globalists still using
[1:14:50.320 --> 1:14:54.160]  the term new world order when they know that there's a resistance to it my
[1:14:54.160 --> 1:14:58.880]  second question is would that globalists still have been able to pull off 9-11 if
[1:14:58.880 --> 1:15:05.800]  Gore would have won the election and my third question is what what books and
[1:15:05.800 --> 1:15:10.520]  films documentaries would you recommend to learn about the founding fathers in
[1:15:10.520 --> 1:15:13.240]  the American Revolution and that's it I'll go ahead and hang up and let you
[1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:19.600]  know okay well hold on a minute give me the first two questions again why are
[1:15:19.600 --> 1:15:23.640]  they still using the term new world order like Gordon Brown Kissinger when
[1:15:23.640 --> 1:15:28.240]  they know that there's a resistance to it they wrote the Mugito paper and the
[1:15:28.240 --> 1:15:33.400]  other question was would they still been able to pull off 9-11 without Cheney
[1:15:33.400 --> 1:15:37.800]  and the Neocons in place said Gore had won because it was a close election and
[1:15:37.800 --> 1:15:41.720]  everything would they still I know Gore is still a puppet but would they've been
[1:15:41.720 --> 1:15:47.560]  able to pull it off without without all their team in in 2000 okay those are
[1:15:47.560 --> 1:15:51.320]  really good questions I wrote them down thank you for the call let me try to
[1:15:51.320 --> 1:15:58.400]  succinctly answer the first question for the last 50 years we would have former
[1:15:58.400 --> 1:16:03.600]  Pentagon officers members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff CIA people you name it
[1:16:03.600 --> 1:16:07.800]  who were in the system university professors think tank operatives
[1:16:07.800 --> 1:16:14.280]  senators house members British lords they would be in these meetings where
[1:16:14.280 --> 1:16:17.640]  they would openly say I mean I've got transcripts of the congressional record
[1:16:17.640 --> 1:16:22.720]  in the 1954 where they had people testifying calling for world government
[1:16:22.720 --> 1:16:27.880]  and so to build anything this big it's got to be out in the open in the actual
[1:16:27.880 --> 1:16:31.800]  power structure and in white papers and in think tanks so it's never been a
[1:16:31.800 --> 1:16:36.280]  secret and so people would come out and say I'm against this and if you talked
[1:16:36.280 --> 1:16:39.160]  about this in the 50s they would poison you they would kill you they would
[1:16:39.160 --> 1:16:43.120]  imprison you they would demonize you I mean because early on this is an
[1:16:43.120 --> 1:16:48.280]  embryonic phase the establishment couldn't be exposed but as they bankrupt
[1:16:48.280 --> 1:16:51.480]  societies as they grew the size of government as they got people on
[1:16:51.480 --> 1:16:57.920]  welfare as they got people into the system as they leveraged derivatives over
[1:16:57.920 --> 1:17:02.760]  the last half century as the elite created more fiat currency and credit
[1:17:02.760 --> 1:17:07.000]  many times over than all the wealth in the world they now believe they're very
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:10.640]  secure in their power and that they have a dumb down population and now they're
[1:17:10.640 --> 1:17:14.560]  openly coming out with the global taxes paid to the IMF and World Bank open
[1:17:14.560 --> 1:17:19.320]  world government power to the private banking cartel that in 1991 at a
[1:17:19.320 --> 1:17:22.600]  Bilderberg conference David Rockefeller called for a global government for the
[1:17:22.600 --> 1:17:31.280]  administrative convenience of the international banking elite okay and so
[1:17:31.280 --> 1:17:35.960]  they stalled everybody by saying it didn't exist and saying it's not kosher
[1:17:35.960 --> 1:17:40.720]  it's not acceptable it's kooky to talk about world government using peer
[1:17:40.720 --> 1:17:44.120]  pressure just to where people in polite conversation wouldn't discuss it it was
[1:17:44.120 --> 1:17:49.920]  like passing gas in church or something you're just not supposed to do it but
[1:17:49.920 --> 1:17:52.760]  over the years especially with the internet we've been successful at
[1:17:52.760 --> 1:17:56.280]  exposing the real system and exposing the fact that they were lying about it in
[1:17:56.280 --> 1:18:00.080]  their own documents so they started losing a lot of credibility and now
[1:18:00.080 --> 1:18:03.280]  they're so far along in their plan they can't deny it anymore so they come out
[1:18:03.280 --> 1:18:06.920]  and put a spin on it they say hey global governance is good it's gonna save the
[1:18:06.920 --> 1:18:10.320]  earth and save the polar bears and penguins hey global governments good it's
[1:18:10.320 --> 1:18:13.560]  gonna help the third world and it turns out they want to rip them off more you
[1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:16.240]  know global government is the only thing that's going to save our society we've
[1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:20.040]  got to do it and they have miss america call for it in all the different movies
[1:18:20.040 --> 1:18:24.160]  and TV shows have propaganda placement in about how great it is and now we have
[1:18:24.160 --> 1:18:30.720]  to have it but they simultaneously have such contempt for the public that they
[1:18:30.720 --> 1:18:35.240]  still say world government doesn't exist dangerous kooks talk about the adl
[1:18:35.240 --> 1:18:38.040]  southern property law center and others and they put out internal government
[1:18:38.040 --> 1:18:41.720]  report saying anybody that talks about this is a nutty kooky wants to kill
[1:18:41.720 --> 1:18:45.840]  police and they actually say that in the mic report because they think cops are
[1:18:45.840 --> 1:18:51.080]  dumb none of this exist officers it's completely insane these people want to
[1:18:51.080 --> 1:18:56.120]  get you now drink your fluoride eat your GMO corn take your vaccine officer just
[1:18:56.120 --> 1:19:01.720]  you know use your du everything's fine so they're still simultaneously saying
[1:19:01.720 --> 1:19:05.720]  none of it exists none of it happens none of it's going on while separately
[1:19:05.720 --> 1:19:11.360]  saying it's the greatest thing since air conditioning and sliced bread so
[1:19:11.360 --> 1:19:15.520]  that's the psychological warfare technique that's going on and that's why
[1:19:15.520 --> 1:19:18.560]  they constantly talk about global government new world order global
[1:19:18.560 --> 1:19:24.200]  governance okay because it's here we've been in the new world order completely
[1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:27.920]  since the mid 1980s there's no doubt of that America's been fully captured by
[1:19:27.920 --> 1:19:31.840]  offshore banks and now they're just running our credit card up to finance
[1:19:31.840 --> 1:19:35.960]  their whole operation and they're using stage terror to set up a police state
[1:19:35.960 --> 1:19:39.000]  grid because they know we've already woken up now they're gonna try to clamp
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:42.760]  down on us so the fight is on I'll come back and talk about could they have
[1:19:42.760 --> 1:19:46.820]  pulled off 9-11 and some of the best books and videos about the founding

[1:25:07.400 --> 1:25:14.000]  several cities in the US including Tulsa Oklahoma that you not be allowed to
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:18.760]  have a garden I can see someday wouldn't even having your own gardens gonna be
[1:25:18.760 --> 1:25:27.760]  against the law because it's sundown on the union what was made in the USA sure
[1:25:27.760 --> 1:25:34.480]  look like a good idea you were in there cringing jaren you don't like my singing
[1:25:34.480 --> 1:25:47.280]  oh watch yourself pal I can't handle it anymore I just can't handle it courts
[1:25:47.280 --> 1:25:51.240]  are ruling they can taser you to answer questions now that's open torture forget
[1:25:51.240 --> 1:25:58.760]  Abu Ghraib torture a camp x-ray torture okay answering the other question could
[1:25:58.760 --> 1:26:04.920]  the neocons have pulled off 9-11 if they wouldn't have been in office and the
[1:26:04.920 --> 1:26:12.040]  answer is the neocons this is the Wall Street Journal by the way Trotsky got
[1:26:12.040 --> 1:26:15.120]  kicked out the US government the British government on record this is
[1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:21.840]  congressional reports funded linen but then by the late 40s early 50s at the
[1:26:21.840 --> 1:26:27.320]  World War two the West couldn't control their fake communist revolution they
[1:26:27.320 --> 1:26:30.480]  wanted to build it up as a counter threat build a police state here that's
[1:26:30.480 --> 1:26:33.040]  how they always do it they create Saddam they create bin Laden they created
[1:26:33.040 --> 1:26:41.040]  all that's on record and so they were unable to control it and Stalin who was
[1:26:41.040 --> 1:26:46.440]  horrible of course but wasn't going along for a while Trotsky had to flee to
[1:26:46.440 --> 1:26:54.880]  Mexico and his top lieutenant of course was the founder of the neocon movement
[1:26:54.880 --> 1:27:04.680]  his son's one of the top neocons today William crystal he said we will
[1:27:04.680 --> 1:27:10.160]  overthrow America just like we did they were the original gang that overthrew
[1:27:10.160 --> 1:27:16.120]  Russia just like we did Russia will do it in America I mean this is on record
[1:27:16.120 --> 1:27:19.480]  they said we will take over the conservative movement so the CIA funded
[1:27:19.480 --> 1:27:23.360]  William F. Buckley all the rest of it the rest is history and this is all on
[1:27:23.360 --> 1:27:29.520]  record and so when you talk about neocons I mean Rahm Emanuel is the top
[1:27:29.520 --> 1:27:34.240]  neocon who in 96 made sure real anti-war Democrats didn't get elected just
[1:27:34.240 --> 1:27:38.960]  like Sarah Palin and Dick army and others of the operatives to make sure real
[1:27:38.960 --> 1:27:42.480]  conservatives real libertarians like ever Medina and Texas don't get elected
[1:27:42.480 --> 1:27:48.480]  it's Rick Perry this is how they do it this is how they operate this is how
[1:27:48.480 --> 1:27:58.000]  they get their job done and so absolutely you better believe 9-11 was
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:04.720]  planned long before Dick Cheney got in now Dick Cheney did get into office
[1:28:04.720 --> 1:28:09.360]  digging into the Pentagon in the White House right along with Donald Rumsfeld
[1:28:09.360 --> 1:28:13.920]  is protege right after L.L. Lemonser got kicked out by Kennedy and he was one of
[1:28:13.920 --> 1:28:16.960]  the top minions of Gerald R. Ford they got the continuity government
[1:28:16.960 --> 1:28:20.720]  legislation passed they had Bill Moore your specials on that in the early 80s
[1:28:20.720 --> 1:28:24.160]  for martial law and how they were planning it
[1:28:24.160 --> 1:28:27.920]  the congressional hearings about it Rex 84 and so
[1:28:27.920 --> 1:28:32.160]  they were top technicians so it's not like would this have happened if Gore
[1:28:32.160 --> 1:28:35.200]  got in they put Bush in company in because they were the
[1:28:35.200 --> 1:28:39.360]  specialist who'd been planning this particular Northwood's ball game
[1:28:39.360 --> 1:28:44.080]  ever since the early 60s operation Northwood's declassified plan to bomb
[1:28:44.080 --> 1:28:47.040]  us cities hijacked jets by remote control crash
[1:28:47.040 --> 1:28:51.840]  and blaming on the Russians and Cuba to start world war three
[1:28:51.840 --> 1:28:56.800]  in ABC news headline Pentagon plan to terrorize us cities as pretext for war
[1:28:56.800 --> 1:29:02.240]  Baltimore Sun similar AP similar that's covered in all my 9-11 films like
[1:29:02.240 --> 1:29:07.280]  road to tyranny but uh you know it's not like what would
[1:29:07.280 --> 1:29:11.200]  have happened if McCain got in McCain was never meant to get in
[1:29:11.200 --> 1:29:13.600]  or what would happen if Al Gore would have got in or what would happen if
[1:29:13.600 --> 1:29:16.720]  George Bush senior would have one another term
[1:29:16.720 --> 1:29:20.320]  well I mean Bill Clinton worked for him Bill Clinton
[1:29:20.320 --> 1:29:24.320]  we know who his CIA section chief was in London
[1:29:24.320 --> 1:29:27.520]  it's all staged folks completely staged
[1:29:27.520 --> 1:29:31.680]  presidents just some hard work and teleprompter reading minion

[1:29:35.600 --> 1:29:38.400]  but these are important questions you asked about founding father books the
[1:29:38.400 --> 1:29:42.000]  best thing to do is actually read books written by the founding fathers
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:46.080]  or read compendiums of their letters and their quotes
[1:29:46.080 --> 1:29:50.240]  that's really the best material out there we'll be back

[1:34:03.120 --> 1:34:07.120]  living in denial chinese style net censorship
[1:34:07.120 --> 1:34:11.200]  and beyond is now being openly and incrementally
[1:34:11.200 --> 1:34:15.440]  deployed across the planet we have had cast sunstein the white house
[1:34:15.440 --> 1:34:20.160]  regulations are come out and say they want to quote ban conspiracy theories
[1:34:20.160 --> 1:34:23.920]  make you get a license to be able to have a website the italian government has
[1:34:23.920 --> 1:34:27.520]  already implemented this the australian government is implementing it
[1:34:27.520 --> 1:34:31.120]  and putting in total net filtering banning websites like
[1:34:31.120 --> 1:34:36.080]  wiki leaks major isps around the world have been banning info wars dot com
[1:34:36.080 --> 1:34:40.720]  and prison planet dot com my sites it's incredible
[1:34:40.720 --> 1:34:47.120]  and the public isn't very savvy about the technical things that are
[1:34:47.120 --> 1:34:51.040]  involved here for instance several new zealand
[1:34:51.040 --> 1:34:54.720]  publications reported and i got hundreds of emails from people in australia
[1:34:54.720 --> 1:34:59.440]  and new zealand in the last week saying that most major isps
[1:34:59.440 --> 1:35:03.200]  were blocking getting the info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[1:35:03.200 --> 1:35:06.720]  and then i got emails saying well wait a minute i'm in australia
[1:35:06.720 --> 1:35:13.440]  or new zealand i can still get it yes on your isp but some of the biggest were
[1:35:13.440 --> 1:35:16.960]  blocking us and there are public statements put out by them
[1:35:16.960 --> 1:35:20.240]  that indeed we were blocked but because of public outcry
[1:35:20.240 --> 1:35:24.320]  we are now not blocked the australian government is saying
[1:35:24.320 --> 1:35:27.840]  they will just add to a list whoever they want or if anyone ever complains about
[1:35:27.840 --> 1:35:30.800]  a site no judge no jury no due process
[1:35:30.800 --> 1:35:34.560]  your site is banned domestic sites in australia are being banned
[1:35:34.560 --> 1:35:38.320]  they're making people now registered with the government to be able to have a
[1:35:38.320 --> 1:35:42.480]  site that criticizes politicians this is in the news
[1:35:42.480 --> 1:35:46.880]  this is happening two weeks ago bill gates came out and said i support china
[1:35:46.880 --> 1:35:51.600]  in their censorship now china mainly uses web filtering
[1:35:51.600 --> 1:35:56.800]  even more abusive and draconian in the united states
[1:35:56.800 --> 1:36:00.960]  we have the head technology officer microsoft and others
[1:36:00.960 --> 1:36:07.520]  at davos and un meetings agreeing with the un saying we want all americans all
[1:36:07.520 --> 1:36:12.560]  brits and all canadians to have to sign in with a net id
[1:36:12.560 --> 1:36:16.960]  preferably via biometric they're openly proposing
[1:36:16.960 --> 1:36:22.800]  that this now happen on top of that i happen to have the cyber security bill
[1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:26.000]  that passed the house of representatives almost overwhelming
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:29.760]  there were just a few votes against it and it's moving on to the senate
[1:36:29.760 --> 1:36:33.680]  and i challenge people to go read this bill for yourself it recruits high
[1:36:33.680 --> 1:36:36.720]  schoolers and college students to join
[1:36:36.720 --> 1:36:40.160]  homeland security the pentagon admits that they now
[1:36:40.160 --> 1:36:43.520]  are hiring tens of thousands of bloggers to counter
[1:36:43.520 --> 1:36:46.560]  disinformation on american blogs they say they may
[1:36:46.560 --> 1:36:50.480]  target now there was an air force a few months ago talked about killing
[1:36:50.480 --> 1:36:53.920]  american journalist in country even the smallest
[1:36:53.920 --> 1:36:58.880]  it provider will have to put in the software and government snooping hubs
[1:36:58.880 --> 1:37:02.160]  where everything is recorded by the government everything's controlled
[1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:06.240]  these indexes of thousands of websites that are banned
[1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:11.120]  have to be installed at the local isp level even in small towns
[1:37:11.120 --> 1:37:16.000]  under these different blacklist we are included info wars dot com prison
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:19.040]  planet dot com all over the country and all over europe
[1:37:19.040 --> 1:37:22.240]  and many other areas of the world we have been sent
[1:37:22.240 --> 1:37:27.760]  countless screenshots uh... of uh... cox communications time warner
[1:37:27.760 --> 1:37:32.160]  you name it is peas in england we've written articles and put links to their
[1:37:32.160 --> 1:37:36.080]  statements going back four years saying
[1:37:36.080 --> 1:37:41.120]  this is objectionable material and uh... there's really four ways they flag
[1:37:41.120 --> 1:37:45.200]  they say porn or they say hate
[1:37:45.200 --> 1:37:50.880]  uh... or they say gambling uh... or illegal activity
[1:37:50.880 --> 1:37:54.800]  and they normally use hate for us now even if you think what we're saying is
[1:37:54.800 --> 1:37:58.320]  hateful shouldn't there be the free speech and you have the decision
[1:37:58.320 --> 1:38:01.360]  to go to info wars dot com or person planet dot com
[1:38:01.360 --> 1:38:04.800]  the truth is we have some of the most banned sites worldwide
[1:38:04.800 --> 1:38:08.400]  because we are effective we cover the real issues
[1:38:08.400 --> 1:38:12.480]  and so it's not just universities and law enforcement centers
[1:38:12.480 --> 1:38:16.240]  uh... and public schools and corporations
[1:38:16.240 --> 1:38:19.840]  that are now banning us we've got a list on
[1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:23.120]  prison planet dot com in an article that paul watson
[1:38:23.120 --> 1:38:27.440]  wrote titled frightening taste of internet censorship
[1:38:27.440 --> 1:38:32.480]  as major free speech website blocked in watson's article
[1:38:32.480 --> 1:38:38.080]  we have links where major transportation hubs in the e u and in
[1:38:38.080 --> 1:38:41.680]  england that are supposedly free internet that's taxpayer paid for
[1:38:41.680 --> 1:38:45.040]  and info wars dot com and prison planet dot com is blocked
[1:38:45.040 --> 1:38:49.440]  so we have been put in these databases fraudulently
[1:38:49.440 --> 1:38:52.880]  to be blocked and you shouldn't put up with it you should complain you should
[1:38:52.880 --> 1:38:55.840]  say no you should call your isp tell them you're
[1:38:55.840 --> 1:38:58.800]  going to move on to somebody else if they continue this because if we allow
[1:38:58.800 --> 1:39:01.840]  this incremental implementation of chinese
[1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:05.120]  style net censorship obviously it's going to hurt our society
[1:39:05.120 --> 1:39:09.680]  every time they attempt to incrementally restrict the internet and the free flow
[1:39:09.680 --> 1:39:12.320]  of information we need to stand up and say no
[1:39:12.320 --> 1:39:16.320]  and we need to stand up to time magazine and the new york times
[1:39:16.320 --> 1:39:19.600]  and countless other mainstream publications that have all called in the
[1:39:19.600 --> 1:39:24.000]  last month for a net id to be able to get online
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:27.360]  who've called for internet taxes who've called for taxes
[1:39:27.360 --> 1:39:31.360]  and regulation on talk radio because they can't just ignore the internet they
[1:39:31.360 --> 1:39:36.160]  can't fund co entel pro and pentagon disinformation to have us all
[1:39:36.160 --> 1:39:38.560]  in fight with each other they've done all that
[1:39:38.560 --> 1:39:42.240]  and it's not working so now they want to incrementally shut it down
[1:39:42.240 --> 1:39:46.960]  they want to force things on the internet to the safe internet as the un
[1:39:46.960 --> 1:39:50.960]  and a microsoft executive said then you'll have the old internet they claim
[1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:54.800]  but if you really read internet to consortium meeting minutes
[1:39:54.800 --> 1:39:58.480]  they plan to force everybody over to the new internet where you have a sub domain
[1:39:58.480 --> 1:40:02.640]  with a major carrier who can shut you down whenever they want
[1:40:02.640 --> 1:40:05.840]  and then they're going to incrementally shut down the old web
[1:40:05.840 --> 1:40:10.640]  and use this cyber security legislation to restrict free speech
[1:40:10.640 --> 1:40:14.480]  and in the words of the white house in the words of barack obama
[1:40:14.480 --> 1:40:18.960]  they have said a declaration of war against free speech that they may
[1:40:18.960 --> 1:40:23.760]  shut the web down to save it during some staged false flag cyber attack they
[1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:28.880]  launch they have said that the pentagon is going to be in control of it
[1:40:28.880 --> 1:40:33.200]  they're building the giant nsa slash pentagon
[1:40:33.200 --> 1:40:37.680]  fortresses all over the country and forcing all the major isps
[1:40:37.680 --> 1:40:41.520]  to wire into their grid they've built a giant separate network
[1:40:41.520 --> 1:40:45.200]  outside of the original internet that they're going to force everyone on to
[1:40:45.200 --> 1:40:49.520]  this is happening it professionals everywhere are discussing it cnet news is
[1:40:49.520 --> 1:40:53.920]  exposing it mother jones back in april of last year almost a year
[1:40:53.920 --> 1:40:57.280]  ago should obama control the internet a new bill would get president emergency
[1:40:57.280 --> 1:41:01.600]  authority to halt web traffic and access private data time magazine pushes
[1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:06.080]  draconian internet licensing plan death of the internet censorship bills in
[1:41:06.080 --> 1:41:10.240]  uk australia us aimed to block undesirable websites
[1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:13.760]  one of their main targets is wiki leaks it's being banned everywhere because it
[1:41:13.760 --> 1:41:17.520]  exposes government corruption obama informations are calls for banning free
[1:41:17.520 --> 1:41:21.120]  speech and i've got his quotes here from the paper that gas
[1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:25.200]  sunstein wrote a year and a half ago quote government might ban conspiracy
[1:41:25.200 --> 1:41:28.320]  theorizing that's any criticism of government that's anything outside
[1:41:28.320 --> 1:41:32.960]  their tiny orthodoxy he lists saying that man made global warming isn't real
[1:41:32.960 --> 1:41:36.640]  as a banable offense he lists saying that a little bit of sunlight is good for
[1:41:36.640 --> 1:41:40.400]  you is a conspiracy theory and should be banned when all the major studies show
[1:41:40.400 --> 1:41:44.480]  it's good for you he says government might impose some kind of new tax
[1:41:44.480 --> 1:41:48.800]  financial or otherwise on those who disseminate such theories i mean folks
[1:41:48.800 --> 1:41:52.160]  this is what they're saying this is really happening
[1:41:52.160 --> 1:41:55.920]  police want backdoor to web users private data without warrants
[1:41:55.920 --> 1:42:00.080]  seen at news under cyber security this is all going on
[1:42:00.080 --> 1:42:06.240]  we are being censored right now do you understand it's happening
[1:42:06.240 --> 1:42:11.520]  idly england canada the u.s australia new zealand are all
[1:42:11.520 --> 1:42:16.160]  implementing this incrementally right now today it's the isps
[1:42:16.160 --> 1:42:20.080]  but the isps are building in partnership with the government it says
[1:42:20.080 --> 1:42:25.680]  private corporate partnerships where they hack up different sectors of the web
[1:42:25.680 --> 1:42:28.560]  and that they will be able to police and do whatever they want
[1:42:28.560 --> 1:42:33.680]  recruiting giant youth squads to serve in homeland security facilities
[1:42:33.680 --> 1:42:37.680]  countering disinformation countering lies about the government
[1:42:37.680 --> 1:42:41.600]  cent com admits they're doing this stop living
[1:42:41.600 --> 1:42:47.760]  in denial this is happening what do we do about it you call the senate
[1:42:47.760 --> 1:42:51.840]  you tell them do not implement the stricconium bill the senate versions
[1:42:51.840 --> 1:42:58.160]  even worse kill the cyber security act understand that our government's been
[1:42:58.160 --> 1:43:01.440]  caught staging false flag after false flag
[1:43:01.440 --> 1:43:04.880]  they're constantly hyping how dangerous the internet is because they can't allow
[1:43:04.880 --> 1:43:08.160]  it to continue to operate because it's exposing their fraud
[1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:11.680]  they have the incentive to launch a fake cyber security attack
[1:43:11.680 --> 1:43:15.920]  just like the gulf of tonkin or the rice tag as a pretext of control
[1:43:15.920 --> 1:43:19.120]  support the free internet now while you still have it
[1:43:19.120 --> 1:43:22.800]  appreciate sites like wiki leaks and info wars dot com
[1:43:22.800 --> 1:43:26.480]  and the electronic frontiers foundation and what it's doing
[1:43:26.480 --> 1:43:32.000]  support sites like krypton all of these sites are under attack on record many of
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:36.480]  them are being raided by the fbi they don't want the people standing up against
[1:43:36.480 --> 1:43:40.240]  what they're doing and they are testing the people's
[1:43:40.240 --> 1:43:44.240]  resolve right now they are pushing the borders of what they can get away with
[1:43:44.240 --> 1:43:48.640]  they're sending up trial balloons now is the time to let them know we are not
[1:43:48.640 --> 1:43:52.160]  going to let more oppressive laws that even
[1:43:52.160 --> 1:43:56.400]  communist china has installed take place here in the united states and in
[1:43:56.400 --> 1:43:59.600]  europe out of the gates they're proposing
[1:43:59.600 --> 1:44:03.280]  more oppressive systems than what china even has
[1:44:03.280 --> 1:44:07.600]  and that's mainstream news it's happening ladies and gentlemen
[1:44:07.600 --> 1:44:10.720]  if you think you're being raped by big government right now
[1:44:10.720 --> 1:44:14.480]  they haven't even gotten started we need to keep the internet free
[1:44:14.480 --> 1:44:17.840]  we're also going to be developing plans to create
[1:44:17.840 --> 1:44:22.000]  printable newspapers dvd distribution other systems
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:26.080]  to get around all of this but in the end we're up against classic tyranny and it
[1:44:26.080 --> 1:44:28.640]  doesn't look good so please spread this video please
[1:44:28.640 --> 1:44:32.080]  spread the articles we've written please make your own videos and analyze the
[1:44:32.080 --> 1:44:35.200]  attacks on the internet if we don't stand together we're all
[1:44:35.200 --> 1:44:39.280]  going to hang separately god bless you all
[1:44:39.280 --> 1:44:42.960]  and there's an article that goes with that video every word i say has a
[1:44:42.960 --> 1:44:46.880]  mainstream news article or a government document
[1:44:46.880 --> 1:44:50.240]  internet censorship alert alex jones exposes a gender to blacklist
[1:44:50.240 --> 1:44:53.600]  ascending sites and licensed users article by

[1:44:58.560 --> 1:45:01.520]  because what we've learned from climate gate and flu gate

[1:45:05.760 --> 1:45:10.080]  new world order fails now i've got roiders here china
[1:45:10.080 --> 1:45:13.440]  people's liberation army officers urge economic punch
[1:45:13.440 --> 1:45:17.920]  against us to dump us bonds and destroy our economy
[1:45:17.920 --> 1:45:20.880]  oh that's our little friend that we gave all our secrets to
[1:45:20.880 --> 1:45:24.160]  but the bankers have moved all our industry to but they're not the threat
[1:45:24.160 --> 1:45:29.360]  no we've got to attack iran that is coming up and here it is
[1:45:29.360 --> 1:45:31.920]  oklahoma law makes home fortification legal
[1:45:31.920 --> 1:45:36.080]  and the law states any type of burglar bars anything
[1:45:36.080 --> 1:45:39.760]  and i've got another report here where they want to license being able to
[1:45:39.760 --> 1:45:43.520]  have a garden because you might grow marijuana

[1:45:55.440 --> 1:45:58.800]  ethan step and others you're on the air chris
[1:45:58.800 --> 1:46:03.040]  hey alex chris here calling from new hampshire the uh... only state in the
[1:46:03.040 --> 1:46:06.800]  country that still doesn't have mandatory uh... seatbelt law how are you
[1:46:06.800 --> 1:46:10.640]  sir live for your die state welcome
[1:46:10.640 --> 1:46:14.560]  absolutely i am uh... very concerned about the internet censorship that's
[1:46:14.560 --> 1:46:18.240]  going on at all levels but it seems like it's just proof
[1:46:18.240 --> 1:46:22.160]  that what we're doing is working and like you say all the time by the enemy is
[1:46:22.160 --> 1:46:27.040]  definitely on the run uh... last year uh... all the people around me my
[1:46:27.040 --> 1:46:31.840]  my family my friends were asleep now stumbling through their daily lives
[1:46:31.840 --> 1:46:35.520]  now my friends and family are waking up and it's amazing to witness the
[1:46:35.520 --> 1:46:39.680]  transformation it's largely due to your films
[1:46:39.680 --> 1:46:44.880]  your websites in your podcast so i thank you and uh... thank god for the internet
[1:46:44.880 --> 1:46:48.880]  and i've got quick uh... three quick things uh... you do
[1:46:48.880 --> 1:46:53.200]  news uh... is gone any information on that
[1:46:53.200 --> 1:46:57.440]  you know uh... we don't have the it people and
[1:46:57.440 --> 1:47:01.440]  i know he was offering to give it to us daryl rundus and i guess we never used
[1:47:01.440 --> 1:47:04.960]  it so we got rid of it uh... perhaps uh...
[1:47:04.960 --> 1:47:09.040]  hey matt will you call daryl rundus and find out where you do news went
[1:47:09.040 --> 1:47:12.800]  they were asking us to take it and put it on our servers and i guess we didn't
[1:47:12.800 --> 1:47:15.520]  so we need to figure that out and get the database if they want to give it to us
[1:47:15.520 --> 1:47:18.640]  no i don't i don't know sir that's the problem i got a million things i want
[1:47:18.640 --> 1:47:22.080]  to do and i can't do them all
[1:47:22.080 --> 1:47:25.840]  uh... the other uh... thing uh... two more things we're getting a second chance
[1:47:25.840 --> 1:47:29.040]  at the uh... tenth amendment resolution here in new hampshire
[1:47:29.040 --> 1:47:32.320]  so i encourage everyone listening to uh... support that i think there's a
[1:47:32.320 --> 1:47:37.040]  hearing on the eleventh uh... and more information can probably be
[1:47:37.040 --> 1:47:40.960]  found uh... you know on the forums in new hampshire
[1:47:40.960 --> 1:47:44.400]  uh... the third thing uh... the company i work for is offering
[1:47:44.400 --> 1:47:50.560]  uh... a hundred free one-year accounts for people who live in new zealand
[1:47:50.560 --> 1:47:55.200]  in australia so they can continue to visit info wars dot com
[1:47:55.200 --> 1:47:58.120]  and enjoy all the information you provide
[1:47:58.120 --> 1:48:01.360]  on if it's okay i'll like about the side of not i i understand what is it a
[1:48:01.360 --> 1:48:04.520]  proxy site or something a proxy server
[1:48:04.520 --> 1:48:09.200]  it's actually better uh... proxy servers generally only allow access to one
[1:48:09.200 --> 1:48:12.960]  protocol which is typically for web traffic is port eighty
[1:48:12.960 --> 1:48:17.360]  uh... the service we provide allows all ports and protocols
[1:48:17.360 --> 1:48:21.280]  uh... so it allows people from new zealand and australia to connect to a
[1:48:21.280 --> 1:48:23.560]  server that we have here in new hampshire
[1:48:23.560 --> 1:48:26.480]  via what's called a virtual private network
[1:48:26.480 --> 1:48:30.600]  and when they do connect to the server then they surf the web
[1:48:30.600 --> 1:48:32.160]  from here
[1:48:32.160 --> 1:48:35.840]  uh... you know that's bypassing all all of us like a proxy
[1:48:35.840 --> 1:48:38.720]  proxy bubble that people are in
[1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:43.240]  it's it's even better it's actually go ahead and go ahead and plug it and i'm
[1:48:43.240 --> 1:48:44.840]  gonna move on go ahead
[1:48:44.840 --> 1:48:48.400]  okay thank you alex it's a patriot internet dot com
[1:48:48.400 --> 1:48:50.280]  all right buddy i appreciate your call
[1:48:50.280 --> 1:48:51.240]  what a great name

[1:48:55.920 --> 1:48:58.960]  alex what a pleasure what a privilege uh...
[1:48:58.960 --> 1:49:01.520]  one thing that bothered me that you said
[1:49:01.520 --> 1:49:05.440]  and you say a lot and i really do worry about you know for personal reasons and
[1:49:05.440 --> 1:49:09.240]  that is you say this stuff's getting to use to make you crazy long and tell you
[1:49:09.240 --> 1:49:13.440]  something my father discovered this stuff back in the nineteen sixties
[1:49:13.440 --> 1:49:15.440]  and it ultimately made him not
[1:49:15.440 --> 1:49:17.800]  he actually cracked up over it
[1:49:17.800 --> 1:49:21.760]  and i don't know no no no no no i mean that's a figure of speech when i say
[1:49:21.760 --> 1:49:23.140]  this stuff's crazy
[1:49:23.140 --> 1:49:26.280]  no minute it is overwhelming but i have a great spirit and then
[1:49:26.280 --> 1:49:29.280]  better spirits and i've ever been in my thirty six years alive so
[1:49:29.280 --> 1:49:32.200]  uh... i don't i'm not sure what you're talking about
[1:49:32.200 --> 1:49:35.640]  well i'm just saying he moved he just couldn't handle it anymore all the
[1:49:35.640 --> 1:49:37.400]  stuff he saw coming in
[1:49:37.400 --> 1:49:41.800]  i mean and back in the sixties you know he he he stumbled on this stuff
[1:49:41.800 --> 1:49:45.320]  and he didn't have obviously the internet stuff and i remember he would just
[1:49:45.320 --> 1:49:49.160]  i mean you know he he went on by carol quigley's book he bought i mean he
[1:49:49.160 --> 1:49:53.880]  started getting so much into this and people back forty five years ago
[1:49:53.880 --> 1:49:57.280]  just thought i mean he was just labeled a complete cook and i'm not in
[1:49:57.280 --> 1:49:59.200]  everything and he eventually did
[1:49:59.200 --> 1:50:01.320]  have a nervous breakdown over the whole thing
[1:50:01.320 --> 1:50:04.080]  and i just don't want that to happen you can you know that's not how peer
[1:50:04.080 --> 1:50:07.320]  pressure works on me when i know i'm right it only makes me stronger when i
[1:50:07.320 --> 1:50:10.440]  get persecuted actually sir it's the opposite
[1:50:10.440 --> 1:50:11.320]  number two
[1:50:11.320 --> 1:50:14.920]  uh... one thing i want to mention i'm a chiropractor i've been fighting the uh...
[1:50:14.920 --> 1:50:19.240]  i've been fighting the uh... vaccinations for the last thirty five years
[1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:20.040]  and
[1:50:20.040 --> 1:50:24.440]  you know and people who think that the vaccinations cured all these diseases
[1:50:24.440 --> 1:50:27.320]  i'm telling you if they look into it they'll find out that nothing could have
[1:50:27.320 --> 1:50:29.720]  been further from the truth that was not legitimate
[1:50:29.720 --> 1:50:34.200]  and even jonah sock admitted that what his vaccine did was not legitimate or
[1:50:34.200 --> 1:50:38.200]  anything else but that's what i have over a hundred million americans
[1:50:38.200 --> 1:50:39.960]  uh... the
[1:50:39.960 --> 1:50:43.880]  sv-40 cancer virus and that's on record i appreciate your call
[1:50:43.880 --> 1:50:46.680]  if you look at the western world by the nineteen twenties people got running
[1:50:46.680 --> 1:50:47.400]  water
[1:50:47.400 --> 1:50:49.960]  and stopped dumping stuff in the street
[1:50:49.960 --> 1:50:53.240]  and suddenly all the diseases went down then vaccines got implemented in the
[1:50:53.240 --> 1:50:54.440]  thirties and forties
[1:50:54.440 --> 1:50:56.680]  and the numbers actually went back up
[1:50:56.680 --> 1:51:01.400]  so it actually made things worse according to the growth statistics
[1:51:01.400 --> 1:51:04.840]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[1:51:04.840 --> 1:51:08.280]  non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[1:51:08.280 --> 1:51:11.560]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[1:51:11.560 --> 1:51:13.240]  valuable than silver or gold
[1:51:13.240 --> 1:51:16.520]  it's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country
[1:51:16.520 --> 1:51:18.840]  and it's possible that could even happen again

[1:51:22.600 --> 1:51:24.120]  non-hybrid seeds

[1:54:50.200 --> 1:54:57.240]  the air hey alex welcome do you remember hi uh do you remember when um Henry Kissinger was at the
[1:54:57.240 --> 1:55:02.840]  new york stock exchange and he was talking about how obama would be the perfect guy to bring in the
[1:55:02.840 --> 1:55:08.760]  new world order yeah we have that clip actually in the obama deception he's perfect to fool the public
[1:55:09.560 --> 1:55:15.800]  yeah well what happened is i called it mark levin his radio show and i was telling him about that
[1:55:15.800 --> 1:55:21.560]  and he said it and he said it didn't exist right no he acted like uh he was surprised because i was
[1:55:21.560 --> 1:55:26.600]  so you know confident you know and what i was telling him you know he goes oh is that what
[1:55:26.600 --> 1:55:31.320]  they is that what he said ron i go yes that's exactly what he said then he went on to you
[1:55:31.320 --> 1:55:34.760]  know scramble up the word like well what do you think about the bully
[1:55:35.720 --> 1:55:40.760]  usually what do you think about the bohemian and i said oh bohemian grove you know and i
[1:55:40.760 --> 1:55:45.560]  told him about the cremation of care and you know he continued on this pattern of trying to
[1:55:45.560 --> 1:55:52.280]  um trap me you know anyway somebody took that recording from that radio show and they made
[1:55:52.280 --> 1:55:58.760]  a breakdown video on youtube and every point that i made that he was trying to you know make
[1:55:58.760 --> 1:56:03.880]  me look they put articles and videos up that's why we're killing them and again it's our model
[1:56:03.880 --> 1:56:08.680]  and i just did it instinctively back from access tv 14 years ago where we put every
[1:56:08.680 --> 1:56:13.400]  article up as we talk everybody's doing that now and it's just devastating what's the name of the
[1:56:13.400 --> 1:56:20.680]  video the name of the video is called mark levin challenging caller on Kissinger's new world
[1:56:20.680 --> 1:56:25.640]  order mentioned did you guys hear that it is right there i'm looking at it right now
[1:56:25.640 --> 1:56:32.520]  now uh oh guys guys get the name of this video again tell us again oh it's um we look one more
[1:56:32.520 --> 1:56:40.200]  time mark levin challenging caller on Kissinger's new world order mentioned okay well that's great
[1:56:40.200 --> 1:56:45.560]  because everybody can call into these shows and do what you've done and reach millions of people
[1:56:45.560 --> 1:56:50.200]  and pretty soon he can't act like you're kooky or weird if half as callers are calling in talking
[1:56:50.200 --> 1:56:56.200]  about it that's why limbaugh's forced to talk about it now uh sabbage is forced to talk about it a
[1:56:56.200 --> 1:56:59.720]  lot more now but he would talk about it actually in the past more than them he had give credit
[1:56:59.720 --> 1:57:05.000]  where it's due and drudge is now last year been covering it all because this is the truth i mean
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:09.800]  they will be obsolete they want to be in the game if they don't start covering the real facts that's
[1:57:09.800 --> 1:57:14.040]  a great news ron keep it up let's talk to ethan in canada ethan you're on the air
[1:57:14.040 --> 1:57:20.680]  hey alex thanks for having me it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance um i just want to commend
[1:57:20.680 --> 1:57:24.760]  you first of all for your courage and exposing these cannibalistic tyrants that are trying to
[1:57:24.760 --> 1:57:30.040]  take over this planet um i myself am calling up from uh ashore ontario canis just a small town
[1:57:30.040 --> 1:57:35.480]  about 50 miles east of tronnell um well my fear is if you guys down there you guys are all arms
[1:57:35.480 --> 1:57:38.680]  you have your amendments that allows you to keep your weapons that they are trying to take from
[1:57:38.680 --> 1:57:44.040]  what i've been hearing um up here in canada basically just jellyfish already they've uh
[1:57:44.040 --> 1:57:48.680]  yeah once they register they always confiscated you see the toronto star where they confiscated
[1:57:48.680 --> 1:57:54.120]  the reporter from the toronto stars single shot shotgun he bought in the 70s came to his door and
[1:57:56.520 --> 1:58:02.520]  that's my point is there the handguns are now uh basically close to restricted uh you're only
[1:58:02.520 --> 1:58:05.960]  allowed certain people are to have them they're trying to make long guns now illegal as well
[1:58:05.960 --> 1:58:10.760]  um basically we're just up here where the central size is so i feel we're in a much worse state than
[1:58:10.760 --> 1:58:17.080]  you guys are down there let me break this down but here's the deal and we don't want this to happen
[1:58:17.080 --> 1:58:24.600]  but if we go into a soviet or nazi type tyranny do you know what you can do with a knife you can
[1:58:24.600 --> 1:58:29.640]  get all the guns you ever wanted if you're willing to use it and i know a lot of people it's easier
[1:58:29.640 --> 1:58:33.400]  to defend yourself with the guns you just pull the trigger but let me tell you something it's
[1:58:33.400 --> 1:58:39.640]  real easy it's real easy to take out four or five people in about 60 seconds with a double-edged

[2:00:05.640 --> 2:00:12.920]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[2:00:12.920 --> 2:00:21.880]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:00:24.520 --> 2:00:30.520]  i suggest everybody take fencing do you have any idea what a sword or a short sword can do
[2:00:31.240 --> 2:00:33.080]  do you have any idea how devastating they are
[2:00:33.080 --> 2:00:43.000]  a longbow a compound bow look to protect yourself from criminals baseball bat
[2:00:43.560 --> 2:00:49.400]  longbow crossbow hatchet hammer ball peen hammer you know what a ball peen hammer a
[2:00:49.400 --> 2:00:55.880]  larger ball peen hammer will do say with a three or four pound head a pound head
[2:00:57.480 --> 2:01:01.800]  a little tip you use the round end somebody busting your house somebody trying to rob you
[2:01:01.800 --> 2:01:06.440]  and your wife somebody trying to rape you beat them to death with a ball peen hammer
[2:01:06.440 --> 2:01:11.320]  usually the assaulters all jazzed up on drugs and things you're going to lay down and take it
[2:01:12.440 --> 2:01:15.880]  now in england they arrest you if you defend yourself with a hammer or a knife they want
[2:01:15.880 --> 2:01:22.360]  the message you are our slaves you don't defend yourself from criminals but the fact is
[2:01:23.960 --> 2:01:29.640]  you know hypothetically say the communist chinese took over no any enemy i mean do you
[2:01:29.640 --> 2:01:38.760]  know what you can do with a hammer i've seen a lot of reports studying world war two where a lot of
[2:01:38.760 --> 2:01:42.840]  centuries and people in some of the trench warfare they had in and around the battle of the bulge
[2:01:44.440 --> 2:01:50.360]  they would simply carry ball peen hammers because when you're crawling around in the snow and up
[2:01:50.360 --> 2:01:55.960]  over berms and reconnaissance you don't and and there may be 20 germans just 50 yards away and
[2:01:55.960 --> 2:02:01.880]  there's a century you just come down on them full power with a hammer on their head it's over
[2:02:05.320 --> 2:02:09.000]  some people say well go up with a knife and get them in the kidneys you better know what
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:15.320]  you're doing if you do that i mean if you don't get it into the right organs fast a lot of people
[2:02:15.320 --> 2:02:20.040]  are so tough they're going to still go ape but there's nothing that stops a ball peen hammer full
[2:02:20.040 --> 2:02:26.760]  force right through the skull it's lights out on mike tyson folks and cops can't get you carrying
[2:02:26.760 --> 2:02:30.520]  a hammer in your car even in cities we're not allowed to arm yourself you have a toolbox back
[2:02:30.520 --> 2:02:37.080]  there some a little ball peen hammer and some car jackers try to take your car they're not expecting
[2:02:37.080 --> 2:02:42.040]  you to do anything they're not expecting you to defend yourself but obviously you want firearms
[2:02:42.040 --> 2:02:47.640]  to protect yourself but does that answer your question Ethan it definitely alleviates some
[2:02:47.640 --> 2:02:53.720]  of the problems i was having in ideas of defense again if you have a standing army against you
[2:02:53.720 --> 2:02:58.440]  with their own firearms you would definitely prefer to have something that you could shoot back
[2:02:58.440 --> 2:03:04.360]  with some sort of any idea what a saber what a saber will do to somebody no which was going to
[2:03:04.360 --> 2:03:09.080]  be a question to have for you was um being a disarmed nation or majority of us being disarmed
[2:03:09.800 --> 2:03:13.560]  in the event of an invasion on the event of martial law in the event of
[2:03:13.560 --> 2:03:21.000]  um outright anarchy uh what are some ideas to defend ourselves or are some things that we can do
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:26.440]  as well in oklahoma you can't even have burglar bars 10 years in prison i've been hearing that

[2:15:32.200 --> 2:15:36.760]  my big list of questions and points i want to go over with you obviously the latest on the crotch
[2:15:36.760 --> 2:15:43.480]  bomber sable edmunds information uh i had uh michael springman on yesterday he just came right
[2:15:43.480 --> 2:15:51.080]  out now and said inside job 9 11 the muslims al qaeda is a cia brigade used to destabilize
[2:15:51.080 --> 2:15:55.640]  countries including the u s and bring in police state the underwear bomber it's on record i want
[2:15:55.640 --> 2:15:59.560]  you to go over that just completely government ops state department admits they were ordered by cia
[2:15:59.560 --> 2:16:03.960]  to let him in and protecting uh the naked body scanners it's come out that they're recording
[2:16:03.960 --> 2:16:09.240]  it and saving it uh i mean so much is going on but what else is on your front burner what else
[2:16:09.240 --> 2:16:14.280]  do you think's important we should know about wane madson well i have a story up today on uh my
[2:16:14.280 --> 2:16:22.280]  website and uh this is going to boggle people's minds we're we're being told that uh all this stuff
[2:16:22.280 --> 2:16:29.240]  about uh derivatives and and uh sovereign debt we're they're talking in terms of trillions of
[2:16:29.240 --> 2:16:35.880]  dollars but uh really the amount of money that's at stake that's put at risk right now right now
[2:16:35.880 --> 2:16:41.800]  it's in the quadrillions and this came from a federal reserve source and i mean that that
[2:16:41.800 --> 2:16:48.760]  operation uh thrives on secrecy but here's here's the thing we're talking about a quad
[2:16:48.760 --> 2:16:55.320]  trillions now uh there was a question posed uh internally at the federal reserve what comes
[2:16:55.320 --> 2:17:01.320]  these are economists of course what comes after the quadrillion and of course the answer to that
[2:17:01.320 --> 2:17:07.240]  is a quintillion and that's where they're heading and and i have a story up today because the first
[2:17:07.240 --> 2:17:14.840]  time i ran across quadrillion was uh in relation to a big scandal that's taking place in france
[2:17:14.840 --> 2:17:23.480]  right now and it has to do with uh a bank account called clear stream in luxembourg that was apparently
[2:17:23.480 --> 2:17:31.080]  used uh to put neocons in power in various countries undermine national economies commit
[2:17:31.080 --> 2:17:37.320]  massive fraud and looting of national treasuries and the former french prime minister dominates the
[2:17:37.320 --> 2:17:45.240]  view pan uh cited this document later the neocons said oh that's a forgery see the neocons produce
[2:17:45.240 --> 2:17:49.880]  forgeries they want everyone to believe them but when there's a document that comes out that they
[2:17:49.880 --> 2:17:57.320]  don't like they they say that's a forgery so nicholas sarcosi the neocon president of france
[2:17:57.320 --> 2:18:03.560]  has been trying to bring criminal charges against the view pan he's he's afraid that the view pan
[2:18:03.560 --> 2:18:08.600]  will challenge him for the french presidency in the next election and if he's found guilty he'd just
[2:18:08.600 --> 2:18:15.080]  be he was just acquitted of these charges but sarcosi who's a who's a real sneak uh has been
[2:18:15.080 --> 2:18:21.800]  using the french judiciary to get uh the view pan reinvited because obviously the view pan and
[2:18:21.800 --> 2:18:28.920]  sources i have in france know about this the scam this huge scam international and scope
[2:18:28.920 --> 2:18:34.760]  and if they succeed in convicting the view pan of course that knocks them out of the
[2:18:34.760 --> 2:18:40.200]  presidential race but with the view pan is president of france uh the neocons are gonna
[2:18:40.920 --> 2:18:47.480]  maybe lose france they just lost ukraine because the orange revolution that was financed by george
[2:18:47.480 --> 2:18:55.240]  soros was is bad because uh victor yana kovic who's a ukrainian nationalist who has no time for ukraine
[2:18:55.240 --> 2:19:01.960]  and nato or any of these other contrivances won that election beat the orange revolution woman
[2:19:03.800 --> 2:19:10.120]  julia temeshenko so ukraine is no longer in the head pocket of the neocons and now the battle
[2:19:10.120 --> 2:19:15.400]  what looks like it's going to move to france i want to come back and continue with the whole
[2:19:15.400 --> 2:19:20.440]  geopolitical layer of the land and integrate that with china saying they want a hard line cold war
[2:19:20.440 --> 2:19:26.040]  with the us their pl a commanders the top generals in their military council calling for dumping
[2:19:26.040 --> 2:19:32.120]  the us bonds to quote punish the united states we've got hillary threatening them with sanctions
[2:19:32.120 --> 2:19:36.760]  if they don't put sanctions on iran are they planning to go into iran wane madson we'll talk
[2:19:36.760 --> 2:19:43.320]  about that why is sarah palin and four neocon publications including national review calling

[2:23:58.200 --> 2:24:14.680]  show we're also going to get into the cyber security bill that's past the house which they admit the
[2:24:14.680 --> 2:24:19.720]  president can then shut down the web to quote protected recruiting youth cores that are gonna
[2:24:19.720 --> 2:24:25.960]  for the pentagon battle disinformation in the us and attack bloggers general saying they may
[2:24:25.960 --> 2:24:32.040]  start killing us reporters i mean this is getting crazy because we're hurting the system wane continuing
[2:24:32.040 --> 2:24:38.120]  with the whole geopolitical breakdown of what's happening and china talking about dumping its
[2:24:38.120 --> 2:24:44.440]  bonds geithner comes out and says don't worry we're safe what's going on well it looks like what the
[2:24:44.440 --> 2:24:49.880]  bomb administration is trying to do is that you don't try to recreate some semblance of a cold war
[2:24:49.880 --> 2:24:57.720]  or obviously the the whole thing about non-state terrorist actors al-qaeda is falling apart on
[2:24:57.720 --> 2:25:04.200]  them so they've got to go after state players and china of course is is a is a emerging superpower
[2:25:05.080 --> 2:25:10.920]  the obama administration has announced the sale of weapons to taiwan which is a real slap at the
[2:25:10.920 --> 2:25:18.920]  chinese who basically have us you know they have us uh you know where the sun doesn't shine uh
[2:25:18.920 --> 2:25:25.160]  the financially they own our debt they own our notes and and this is just kind of sort of like
[2:25:25.160 --> 2:25:34.120]  kind of a war era breakmanship only not with nuclear weapons but with threats of economic
[2:25:34.120 --> 2:25:41.240]  threats and and the like and um is this the hope and change message that everybody was expecting
[2:25:41.240 --> 2:25:48.680]  to see a chill uh on us chinese relations now china's no they're no angel of course but we
[2:25:48.680 --> 2:25:53.640]  deal with a lot of countries around the world that have dictators uh we can choose them very
[2:25:53.640 --> 2:25:59.240]  carefully we refuse to have relations with cuba but we have no problem dealing with the saldies
[2:25:59.240 --> 2:26:07.080]  and and the egyptians uh their dictatorships but we have our nose now at uh iran and and uh
[2:26:07.080 --> 2:26:15.320]  and hillary of course uh stating that uh she wants to china to join the uh the western powers and
[2:26:15.320 --> 2:26:19.800]  enrageting up tensions with iran i would note that iran with this whole issue of
[2:26:20.600 --> 2:26:25.320]  enriching iranium right now there are three percent enriched iranium they're they're jumping
[2:26:25.320 --> 2:26:32.840]  that up to 20 percent enrichment because they they needed for nuclear medicine um and also for
[2:26:32.840 --> 2:26:39.800]  their their power plant you know 90 percent enriched iranium to develop a bomb uh and they're
[2:26:39.800 --> 2:26:44.680]  nowhere close to that but isn't an interesting what they didn't like was this deal being worked
[2:26:44.680 --> 2:26:50.600]  out where iran would ship its current iranium to be enriched and it would be enriched uh in
[2:26:50.600 --> 2:26:56.920]  france well france is controlled by sarcosi and why in the world would the iranians want to trust
[2:26:56.920 --> 2:27:03.880]  this guy who's now been you know pegged as a as a total monotone fraud putting there with this
[2:27:04.680 --> 2:27:10.040]  let me throw this out there they've always brought the un in they've given into the un unlike any
[2:27:10.040 --> 2:27:15.960]  other nation ever has they always report their new facilities they say okay so it's not weapons grade
[2:27:15.960 --> 2:27:22.280]  we'll let china your ally do it and they go no we must have war we've seen sarah palin
[2:27:22.840 --> 2:27:30.760]  we've seen uh all these other neocons come out and say we must have war huckabee we uh the national
[2:27:30.760 --> 2:27:36.920]  review we must have war now i mean they're saying we must in israel saying we want quote crippling
[2:27:36.920 --> 2:27:44.280]  sanctions well right and and and it isn't an interesting all this happens after poppy bush
[2:27:44.280 --> 2:27:49.320]  and jeb bush make this unannounced visit to the white house i believe it was about a week ago
[2:27:49.320 --> 2:27:54.280]  what's the word on that what was really happening no really no it wasn't it was they said it was a
[2:27:54.280 --> 2:27:59.880]  just a personal meeting uh there's no personal meetings that we could just talk to her to the
[2:27:59.880 --> 2:28:04.760]  white house like that and i i think it's very interesting that george w bush when he was on
[2:28:04.760 --> 2:28:11.480]  meet the press with um bill clinton trying to raise money for haiti relief uh said something about
[2:28:11.480 --> 2:28:15.880]  well you got to be careful about who you get money to because there's a lot of shysters that
[2:28:15.880 --> 2:28:24.040]  show up well that george w bush was even paying an iota of attention when he was president for
[2:28:24.040 --> 2:28:29.400]  eight years he might know who the shysters are and it would be interesting to get him to actually
[2:28:29.400 --> 2:28:34.120]  say because of course he was sitting next to one of the biggest shysters around bill clinton
[2:28:34.120 --> 2:28:40.040]  who would poppy bush raise all this money for the tsunami victims but very little i understand
[2:28:40.040 --> 2:28:45.160]  actually reached the people who needed it it's just another one of these scams and obviously bush
[2:28:45.160 --> 2:28:50.760]  who's not the sharpest knife in the drawer nor there's the greatest lamp in the in the chandelier
[2:28:50.760 --> 2:28:58.120]  even said you know you got to be careful shysters uh you know what it'd be interesting if bush actually
[2:28:58.120 --> 2:29:04.520]  you know in in some um moment of um lucidity would actually start talking about the shysters he
[2:29:04.520 --> 2:29:10.040]  encountered as president in the united states he might go a little bit uh uh towards redeeming
[2:29:10.040 --> 2:29:14.280]  himself although i don't i don't think he'll ever redeem himself he's got too much blood on his hands
[2:29:14.280 --> 2:29:20.360]  but uh let's remember teddy roosevelt was a republican who left that party in total disgust
[2:29:20.360 --> 2:29:26.840]  and ran as a bold news progressive ranting and raving about the power of the corporation so uh
[2:29:26.840 --> 2:29:31.880]  this is there is there is a possibility he could you know he could go that direction but certainly
[2:29:32.600 --> 2:29:37.400]  no one knows what that what that meeting in the white house was about but maybe he was uh they
[2:29:37.400 --> 2:29:43.080]  were giving uh obama his marching order let's get into cyber security and a lot more coming up
[2:29:43.080 --> 2:29:48.760]  plus the underwear bomber uh straight ahead with wane madson our guests stay with us

[2:32:07.400 --> 2:32:12.760]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power
[2:32:12.760 --> 2:32:18.200]  your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[2:32:18.200 --> 2:32:23.480]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[2:32:23.480 --> 2:32:28.760]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem

[2:33:53.160 --> 2:33:58.920]  we hope you buy the dvds but that's not the mission the mission is yes to fund our operation but
[2:33:58.920 --> 2:34:04.520]  funding the operation is only the launchpad to battle the globalist and shadow the left right
[2:34:04.520 --> 2:34:12.280]  paradigm and warn the people going back to wane madson uh wane i mean there's so much to cover
[2:34:12.280 --> 2:34:19.000]  here so much going on so much happening what would you say the state is of the us israel
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:24.920]  and england that are all allied together with the e u what would be because all over the world
[2:34:25.480 --> 2:34:29.480]  resistance is mounting to the fact that our nations have been captured and being used
[2:34:29.480 --> 2:34:35.320]  as engines of tyranny and you talked about how all over the world people are now recognizing
[2:34:35.320 --> 2:34:40.680]  this new equivalent to the former soviet tyranny the evil empire the people in america are waking
[2:34:40.680 --> 2:34:47.560]  up both political parties approval ratings are plunging and so the system is going to strike back
[2:34:47.560 --> 2:34:52.600]  how are they doing that with the new cybersecurity system i guess because i've read the cybersecurity
[2:34:52.600 --> 2:34:58.600]  bill in the house that passed the senate's even worse i mean i can't believe what's in this i'm
[2:34:58.600 --> 2:35:03.240]  going to be covering it more next hour i know you know about it uh but i don't think people realize
[2:35:03.240 --> 2:35:07.720]  that microsoft is building all these cyber security centers being paid by the federal government
[2:35:07.720 --> 2:35:14.440]  openly to censor bill gates is saying it's good time magazine newsweek uh the british papers
[2:35:14.440 --> 2:35:18.520]  new york times saying you're going to have an internet id to get online biometric scan
[2:35:19.480 --> 2:35:23.400]  all it facilities even down to people that serve a hundred customers
[2:35:23.400 --> 2:35:28.440]  are more that's the most tiny isp will have to put government monitoring software openly
[2:35:28.440 --> 2:35:34.200]  snooping and that runs your system so they can ban any websites they want now info wars and prison
[2:35:34.200 --> 2:35:40.120]  planet along with wiki leaks and electronic frontiers foundation are suddenly getting banned by isps
[2:35:40.120 --> 2:35:47.960]  from new zealand to italy i mean they're moving sir absolutely and and and you know you'd be a couple
[2:35:47.960 --> 2:35:54.040]  i mean i spent a long time in computer security and there's a lot of reasons to have a lot of
[2:35:54.600 --> 2:36:00.040]  countermeasures in place but what we're seeing here is something much more than that we have the
[2:36:00.040 --> 2:36:05.240]  national security agency cutting a deal with google they've already had deals with motorola
[2:36:05.240 --> 2:36:12.040]  with intel with microsoft this is basically building intelligence inside the paraphrase
[2:36:12.040 --> 2:36:17.800]  the old intel uh slogan intel inside and that's what we're going to see and then you couple
[2:36:19.240 --> 2:36:26.440]  these initiatives like the cyber security bill with ks sunstein who's the head of the
[2:36:26.440 --> 2:36:31.640]  white house office of information and regulatory affairs who basically has come out and said
[2:36:31.640 --> 2:36:37.480]  it's the job of the government to basically basically break the back of conspirator that he
[2:36:37.480 --> 2:36:43.480]  uses the word conspiracy theorist he wrote a book called infotopia where he talks about the danger
[2:36:43.480 --> 2:36:48.520]  of people who don't engage in the group thing being pushed by the corporate media and i think
[2:36:48.520 --> 2:36:53.880]  when you have sunstein who by the way i hear if there's there may be two vacancies on the court
[2:36:53.880 --> 2:37:01.240]  soon the supreme court um stevens may be leaving as well as ginsburg and he may be on the short list
[2:37:01.240 --> 2:37:07.640]  for what i'm hearing he was on the list last time with so do my or right and and this is uh
[2:37:07.640 --> 2:37:14.920]  this is a nightmare to have a guy like that uh you know basically preaching censorship and then
[2:37:14.920 --> 2:37:21.800]  infiltrating groups that they don't agree with uh this is right out of co-intel pro 1960s and
[2:37:21.800 --> 2:37:28.760]  70s the fbi did uh they they infiltrated various anti-war groups civil rights groups and others
[2:37:28.760 --> 2:37:34.280]  but uh you couple all these things together and you know you don't need a crisp of all to see
[2:37:34.280 --> 2:37:39.320]  where they're going they have to control the internet the internet is that was developed with
[2:37:39.320 --> 2:37:46.840]  dov money but it's turned out to be uh something that uh is is is helping to illuminate uh what's
[2:37:46.840 --> 2:37:53.800]  going on with these various um power centers around the world especially um you know as i said what
[2:37:53.800 --> 2:38:01.240]  the neocons are up to with their total disinformation campaign going after uh well you know politicians
[2:38:01.240 --> 2:38:06.440]  who aren't falling in line and uh i think it's something that everybody has to be concerned
[2:38:06.440 --> 2:38:11.880]  about as a matter of fact i've gone ahead and bought a uh an old um underwood uh typewriter because
[2:38:11.880 --> 2:38:17.640]  if they if they shut down the net i i'll have that and i'll get an old mimei grand machine and
[2:38:17.640 --> 2:38:21.640]  i'll just go back to the way it used to be and start putting out this information and
[2:38:21.640 --> 2:38:28.360]  in leaflets like uh like was and by the way wane you're you're not joking i put out a internet video
[2:38:29.640 --> 2:38:36.600]  this morning that that's already gone viral and in 10 minutes 50 seconds i break down everything
[2:38:36.600 --> 2:38:41.160]  that's happening we show all the government documents and announcements the why house says
[2:38:41.160 --> 2:38:45.400]  they're going to force us over to internet too no one will have freedom of speech will all have
[2:38:45.400 --> 2:38:50.920]  subdomains they're going to incrementally shut down the old web all these indexes of banned sites
[2:38:50.920 --> 2:38:56.120]  are going into the isps right now and all the big newspapers are calling for censoring alternative
[2:38:56.120 --> 2:39:02.600]  media because we're kicking their butts the truth is trumping their lies they're all going bankrupt
[2:39:02.600 --> 2:39:08.360]  so it's a perfect storm of government corporations and media that can't compete with the truth they
[2:39:08.360 --> 2:39:13.640]  are really starting to drop the hammer and i think it's important to get the word out now to scream
[2:39:13.640 --> 2:39:20.280]  bloody murder because if we don't respond to them just test firing or or beta testing or
[2:39:20.280 --> 2:39:26.200]  trial ballooning the idea of censoring the web i mean this is clearly a test right now do you agree
[2:39:26.920 --> 2:39:31.560]  oh i think they're so yeah they're they're floating all kinds of trial balloons here to see
[2:39:31.560 --> 2:39:35.560]  just how far they can go and if they you know you give them an inch they're going to take 10
[2:39:35.560 --> 2:39:41.720]  thousand miles and um it's certainly uh it's it's it's you know i look at the i pick up the
[2:39:41.720 --> 2:39:47.400]  washington post now and it's it's it's it's it rivals prod during the days of the soviet union
[2:39:47.400 --> 2:39:53.560]  with its total disinformation uh the washington post is owned by an education company they no
[2:39:53.560 --> 2:39:58.920]  longer really are in the news business they they run catholic they have kaplan business
[2:39:59.480 --> 2:40:05.800]  uh that it's a training an education company uh and and and you can't even you can't believe
[2:40:05.800 --> 2:40:12.120]  anything they print about education issues because they're trying to push the privatization
[2:40:12.120 --> 2:40:18.120]  of public education and um and it doesn't stop there everything they write about
[2:40:19.080 --> 2:40:24.920]  for example they covered the ukrainian election they started out by saying victory anacoga
[2:40:24.920 --> 2:40:31.640]  shake a one-time party boss who was accused of criminal activity that's the first sentence
[2:40:31.640 --> 2:40:36.440]  i mean they don't say anything about who backs these neocons in these various countries like
[2:40:36.440 --> 2:40:42.840]  uh that uh you shanko who did not win this election that he wanted to force ukraine to join
[2:40:42.840 --> 2:40:48.120]  nato and and the other candidates you don't get you don't get anything about you shanko who was
[2:40:48.120 --> 2:40:54.280]  put in office by a massive amount of money from george soros you don't see that so it's it's very
[2:40:54.280 --> 2:40:59.960]  biased to watch them post it's not a literal paper people it's an establishment paper it's an elite
[2:40:59.960 --> 2:41:05.560]  newspaper let's shift gears i want to get into the underwear bomber i know the audience knows this
[2:41:05.560 --> 2:41:11.800]  but the general public it's been an abc news detroit news but buried in the articles this is
[2:41:11.800 --> 2:41:17.720]  now been out for a week and a half oh yeah it's true there was a sharp dress man the state department
[2:41:17.720 --> 2:41:23.080]  was told by us intelligence to let him in because they didn't want to tip off al-qaeda and yeah there
[2:41:23.080 --> 2:41:28.200]  was a second man on the plane that did have a bomb but and kurt haskell did tell the truth
[2:41:28.200 --> 2:41:33.400]  but we're not going to talk about that i mean this is another false flag another setup
[2:41:33.400 --> 2:41:39.800]  undoubtedly it was a false flag and we got information that he he flew with a one-way
[2:41:39.800 --> 2:41:45.240]  ticket not true it was round trip they changed that he was supposed to fly back to akra gana
[2:41:45.240 --> 2:41:49.640]  where that ticket was originally purchased with cash they changed it so he would fly back to
[2:41:49.640 --> 2:41:56.760]  legos nigeria so we got all this this information about mitalip and now we hear he's cooperating
[2:41:56.760 --> 2:42:02.680]  with us intelligence to the turning over he's it sounds like he's being debriefed more than
[2:42:02.680 --> 2:42:09.000]  anything else that he was an agent of influence who was used and now whatever he's talking about
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:13.880]  it sounds like a typical intelligence agency briefing as far as i'm concerned and i think
[2:42:13.880 --> 2:42:19.240]  that it was a false flag and of course chair top was out there saying oh you've got to we
[2:42:19.240 --> 2:42:24.600]  got to get these uh... standards and uh... even though he's he's got a financial uh interest in
[2:42:24.600 --> 2:42:32.360]  some of the companies that are pushing these body scanners and in the debriefing he comes out
[2:42:32.360 --> 2:42:38.200]  and says al-qaeda will hit the next three to six months devastating exactly what they wanted to hear
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:43.240]  and then they run out and they have all the intelligence chiefs before congress last week
[2:42:43.240 --> 2:42:49.400]  and said we will be hit and notice this all kicks off right as they massed forces in yemen
[2:42:49.400 --> 2:42:53.560]  it was like they massed forces in and around afghanistan right before nine eleven and again
[2:42:53.560 --> 2:42:58.920]  it's hidden in plain view and in a few major newspapers and publications but just buried
[2:42:58.920 --> 2:43:04.200]  in the article okay mister kennedy the head of the subdivision of the state department says
[2:43:04.200 --> 2:43:09.400]  they were ordered by the cia to let him get in even though he didn't have a visa and yeah
[2:43:09.400 --> 2:43:14.040]  somebody got him through security and got him on board the plane i mean who's the sharp dress man
[2:43:14.040 --> 2:43:19.320]  that can lead you up through security past the body scanners which that airport had that's on
[2:43:19.320 --> 2:43:25.240]  record and get him on the plane only high-level security can do that and they admit they helped
[2:43:25.240 --> 2:43:29.960]  him get on they just don't say they were the sharp dress man they deny the sharp dress man now they
[2:43:29.960 --> 2:43:35.400]  admit it but they say we're not worried about that i mean how obvious and then his dad knows
[2:43:35.400 --> 2:43:40.280]  they're setting him up goes and says he's gonna attack you and nothing's done but meanwhile
[2:43:40.280 --> 2:43:44.760]  women are having their breasts grope at the airports right and we know that the company
[2:43:44.760 --> 2:43:52.680]  responsible for security at amsterdam was icps israeli uh operation that also did the security
[2:43:52.680 --> 2:43:57.960]  at the galler port in paris and and allow richard reid the shoe bomber to get on that american
[2:43:57.960 --> 2:44:04.440]  airlines flight to miami and uh... isn't that interesting because richard reid had also
[2:44:04.440 --> 2:44:09.480]  boarded an allow flight earlier to tel Aviv now if this guy's so dangerous i mean allow
[2:44:09.480 --> 2:44:14.040]  supposed to have this totally have a strictest security in the world but he was allowed to
[2:44:14.040 --> 2:44:20.200]  get on that plane because we were told then they wanted to see who he was meeting in israeli
[2:44:20.200 --> 2:44:24.280]  they said that's the same story here so let's story you know that i mean that's on record
[2:44:24.280 --> 2:44:29.160]  exactly way absolutely and then days after it happens not just billions of naked body
[2:44:29.160 --> 2:44:35.400]  scanners worldwide but israel says we may get a contract with homeland security to run everything
[2:44:35.400 --> 2:44:40.200]  because we know how to keep you safe meanwhile it's an israeli company that lets them all get on
[2:44:40.200 --> 2:44:45.640]  board well i think it's just another indication of the you know what interests who benefited
[2:44:45.640 --> 2:44:51.240]  from this of course chair top benefit uh... israel benefits because it keeps this
[2:44:51.240 --> 2:44:58.680]  this al-qaeda bogeyman alive uh... when it's increasingly becoming apparent that robin
[2:44:58.680 --> 2:45:05.160]  cook the late barn secretary of britain when he said al-qaeda is nothing more than a cia database
[2:45:05.160 --> 2:45:11.320]  he died of a heart attack supposedly while hiking up in scotland shortly after he made those comments
[2:45:11.320 --> 2:45:16.680]  and so did david kelly and everybody else it just continues and expanding from there looking
[2:45:16.680 --> 2:45:24.120]  into your crystal ball all your nsa cia contacts are they planning to attack iran because they're
[2:45:24.120 --> 2:45:29.320]  openly saying they will the neocons are threatening obama saying you will attack or you're a first
[2:45:29.320 --> 2:45:35.080]  turmer and i'm sure you saw the sarah palin clips about i would declare war on iran and hit them now
[2:45:35.080 --> 2:45:40.040]  that's what obama should do play the war card we've got neocons saying man we should eat another
[2:45:40.040 --> 2:45:45.320]  nine eleven you know we were as happy as pigs and you know what i mean this is really they're
[2:45:45.320 --> 2:45:51.320]  they might as well i think back three years ago when they had five of the former pentagon generals
[2:45:51.320 --> 2:45:57.080]  who were the five network military correspondence in that audio tape that one of the aids recorded
[2:45:57.080 --> 2:46:00.360]  going man we sure need another line eleven it sure helped us what are we going to do
[2:46:00.360 --> 2:46:06.760]  rumsfeld he goes it's hard it's they'll we let's talk later i mean we played that audio they
[2:46:06.760 --> 2:46:13.080]  almost say they did it in that tape right and and also uh it's interesting what's coming out of
[2:46:13.080 --> 2:46:20.600]  the chillcott inquiry in london looking about how britain was forced to go against and join
[2:46:20.600 --> 2:46:28.120]  this war against iraq and and just out today we're reading about how the memos were released
[2:46:28.120 --> 2:46:33.400]  the state that you know the whole thing about france blocking the war effort in the un security
[2:46:33.400 --> 2:46:38.920]  council there was a plan that france doesn't go along we're going to engage in an anti-french
[2:46:38.920 --> 2:46:44.600]  campaign hence we had the freedom prize we had the french surrender monkeys all this stuff was
[2:46:44.600 --> 2:46:50.600]  preplanned by the neocons and by the way france helped found this country i mean i'm i'm i'm
[2:46:50.600 --> 2:46:56.040]  you know of my hinds 57 i'm mainly english and and welsh so not bashing the british people
[2:46:56.040 --> 2:47:02.360]  but britain is now sold as the founder of america no france are not a bunch of surrender monkeys
[2:47:02.360 --> 2:47:10.920]  absolutely and and of course the the two people who were most against france getting involved
[2:47:10.920 --> 2:47:16.440]  with that and really basically called them on called britain appellation blare on this whole
[2:47:16.440 --> 2:47:24.280]  phony argument about wmd's in iraq uh it was president shiroch and dominique the viltan the
[2:47:24.280 --> 2:47:30.360]  man that that sarcosia is trying to put in prison he does not want that he does not want the viltan
[2:47:30.360 --> 2:47:36.200]  to be the next president of france because of he takes over the abley's a palace he's in a position
[2:47:36.200 --> 2:47:44.040]  to expose even more of these crimes by the neocons well you notice that in 1950 1946 when nato got
[2:47:44.040 --> 2:47:51.000]  set up that france said give us our nukes get out of our country they found out nato was planning
[2:47:51.000 --> 2:47:57.720]  to take over like the vc french had done uh in 41 for hitler he found out about that
[2:47:57.720 --> 2:48:04.200]  that and uh the gall did so that the british tried to kill him repeatedly with the jackal that's on
[2:48:04.200 --> 2:48:11.560]  record and it's clear sarcosia isn't even french uh he's this enemy agent coming in and they join
[2:48:11.560 --> 2:48:18.520]  nato again right and and they you know sending more troops to afghanistan and this whole this whole
[2:48:18.520 --> 2:48:24.680]  thing was to basically eliminate france as one of the countries that stands in a way of the uh the
[2:48:24.680 --> 2:48:29.880]  goals of the neocons to uh basically you know let's be let's be frank take over the world that's
[2:48:29.880 --> 2:48:35.640]  what their contention is and now we see these these bankers are they're trying to bring down the
[2:48:35.640 --> 2:48:42.120]  euro by attacking what they call the pigs which is portugal italy maybe ireland could be in there to
[2:48:42.120 --> 2:48:46.840]  greece and spain the greek trade unions are going out on a strike because they're being told
[2:48:46.840 --> 2:48:52.360]  you're not going to be able to retire one um you know at 63 you're not going to get pensions and all
[2:48:52.360 --> 2:48:57.560]  this other things so yeah they're getting upset like american workers should be because they're
[2:48:57.560 --> 2:49:02.440]  now in the banking rules saying the government may take your pensions and then tax it and give
[2:49:02.440 --> 2:49:07.400]  you part of it back they're not going to ensure money markets i mean i mean my god this is bad
[2:49:08.200 --> 2:49:13.880]  right and also there we're also seeing an attack on japan trying to bring down the value of the
[2:49:13.880 --> 2:49:20.840]  end by this this whole thing about toyota uh when in fact the the parts that are made for those toyota
[2:49:20.840 --> 2:49:28.120]  cars are made by an indian owned u.s company in indiana does that sound like industrial espionage
[2:49:28.120 --> 2:49:33.000]  to you oh absolutely it's economic warfare industrial espionage they're they're they're
[2:49:33.000 --> 2:49:37.560]  trying to get at the end through toyota this is railroad they were public and transportation
[2:49:37.560 --> 2:49:44.280]  secretary uh doing this and and it just goes to show that the people in charge of treasury
[2:49:44.280 --> 2:49:50.040]  geithner and urnaki and obama and immanuel and all these people are really not much different
[2:49:50.040 --> 2:49:55.880]  than what we had in the past with with bush cheney uh rum spell the hank paulson and the rest of
[2:49:55.880 --> 2:50:02.040]  these criminals well they're worse because the left has gone to sleep absolutely and i i noticed

[2:54:25.240 --> 2:54:32.040]  studying them reading their own declassified manuals clearly i have no doubt in my mind just
[2:54:32.040 --> 2:54:36.920]  like i did before 9 11 they are preparing to launch massive terror attacks in this country
[2:54:36.920 --> 2:54:41.080]  i've been saying it the last three months before the underwear bomber before two weeks ago announcing
[2:54:41.080 --> 2:54:48.760]  we will be hit the next three to six months by the pentagon and by the fbi and obama i should
[2:54:48.760 --> 2:54:54.760]  have covered this is the top story today it's the top of drudge is saying in the associated press
[2:54:54.760 --> 2:55:02.600]  if you criticize him you're going to allow al-qaeda to attack in 2003 during the election
[2:55:02.600 --> 2:55:08.200]  cheney told us news and world report in a print interview anyone on meet the press and said
[2:55:08.200 --> 2:55:12.120]  if you get in the way of what we're doing and criticize us and investigate us for torture
[2:55:12.120 --> 2:55:20.680]  or for this war you are going to allow a nuke to go off and he smiled now clearly the neocons
[2:55:20.680 --> 2:55:26.120]  are running the show there's no doubt of that now their foil obama is exposed wane madson do you
[2:55:26.120 --> 2:55:31.000]  agree with me that the only card they've got i even use the term card is fake terror and wars
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:36.600]  and now they're saying play the war card knowing if they really attack iran we won't have to sit
[2:55:36.600 --> 2:55:42.440]  around waiting for fake terror attacks iran is going to go absolutely ape well and we'll see
[2:55:42.440 --> 2:55:47.320]  that if they if they do i notice that one of the things being pushed now is for russia that would
[2:55:47.320 --> 2:55:52.760]  draw its engineers from the bushier nuclear power plant on the on the gulf that's being
[2:55:52.760 --> 2:55:58.840]  constructed now that that would be the green light for an attack on that power plant right now
[2:55:58.840 --> 2:56:03.640]  they won't attack it because a lot of russians will die and that will create a but they blew up
[2:56:03.640 --> 2:56:09.400]  serb post with russians in them they attacked they attacked south ossetia with russians oh sure
[2:56:09.400 --> 2:56:15.400]  and that's all part of it now now that we see a uh a a a a a friendlier government to russia and
[2:56:15.400 --> 2:56:20.840]  ukraine what i think is going to happen will happen we're going to see russia ukraine and turkey
[2:56:20.840 --> 2:56:26.040]  and turkey of course has had it with uh the neocons as well and and that gets into what
[2:56:26.040 --> 2:56:31.640]  sable edmunds said a long time ago about the turkish excuse me the turkish state now we know
[2:56:31.640 --> 2:56:37.880]  there's a group called organicon have been active in turkey for for decades and old gladio uh
[2:56:37.880 --> 2:56:43.240]  behind the scenes underground movement that has been linked to israeli intelligence and they find
[2:56:43.240 --> 2:56:47.960]  out that a lot of turkish generals have been involved in this and one of the things they've
[2:56:47.960 --> 2:56:53.960]  tried to do is overthrow the government of uh prime minister erdogan who basically has taken
[2:56:53.960 --> 2:57:00.120]  turkey on a much more independent path and but i would i would say that with russia ukraine and
[2:57:00.120 --> 2:57:05.720]  turkey uh that the the regime in in georgia the sakasvili regime that was put in there with
[2:57:05.720 --> 2:57:11.480]  soros money uh their days may be numbered so we may be seeing another outbreak of uh
[2:57:11.480 --> 2:57:17.720]  hostilities in the caucuses very soon it may not be iran it may still over to iran but we may see
[2:57:17.720 --> 2:57:26.600]  something happen in the caucuses first so what's the word in dc when with all your contacts i mean
[2:57:26.600 --> 2:57:32.120]  are they mulling attacking iran or going with these crippling sanctions as israel has called them i mean
[2:57:32.120 --> 2:57:38.040]  what's the 50 50 60 40 i mean are they going to hit iran and win well i think they've always
[2:57:38.040 --> 2:57:42.840]  wanted to hit iran i've been writing about contingency plans that have gone hot on occasion
[2:57:42.840 --> 2:57:50.520]  not during bush and and now under obama they said that is there that is the neocon um wet tree
[2:57:50.520 --> 2:57:55.960]  really that's that's what they want to do and i think they will stop at nothing to to seek a
[2:57:55.960 --> 2:58:02.680]  military confrontation with iran in iran and knows it i mean yes there are some terrible ideologues
[2:58:02.680 --> 2:58:09.160]  in the iranian government uh but uh we have to realize that um there was western involvement
[2:58:09.160 --> 2:58:15.720]  in that green revolution yet another themed revolution a la george soros and and i think
[2:58:15.720 --> 2:58:22.600]  we're going to see a lot of blowback from from that involvement not by the west stay there my

[3:00:10.920 --> 3:00:17.160]  check it out today wane i know you're working on this story the g20 they openly announced world
[3:00:17.160 --> 3:00:23.640]  government a few months ago but i saw uh the australian newspapers all reported headline
[3:00:23.640 --> 3:00:31.400]  secret banker meeting in australia the heads of the central banks 24 total uh what are they meeting
[3:00:31.400 --> 3:00:37.400]  about how does this tie into china and their military saying dump us bonds why is china
[3:00:37.400 --> 3:00:41.560]  saying this what's really going on in the secret meeting well you know there's secret
[3:00:41.560 --> 3:00:47.880]  meetings so that's we we don't really know we can we can postulate you know all we all we want to
[3:00:47.880 --> 3:00:52.920]  but the fact is that these bankers have these secret conclaves i understand geithner went to
[3:00:52.920 --> 3:00:59.400]  another meeting up in nunabut which is the canadian arctic territory it's one of the most remote
[3:00:59.400 --> 3:01:04.600]  places on the on the planet and what what in the world was going on up there what was going on with
[3:01:04.600 --> 3:01:09.320]  this meeting in australia of course they just had the meeting in davos uh where the head of
[3:01:09.320 --> 3:01:15.720]  security uh was found dead in a hotel room next to the congress center i mean it's just stuff like
[3:01:15.720 --> 3:01:23.800]  out of a um uh uh a dan brown novel uh you can't make this kind of stuff up but uh but i do know
[3:01:23.800 --> 3:01:29.080]  that uh the people at the federal reserve are quite proud of the fact that they meet in secret
[3:01:29.080 --> 3:01:36.200]  they call that place the temple and uh no information leaves the temple and all these that this idea
[3:01:36.200 --> 3:01:41.160]  more transparency i think is just a bunch of oddwash they're trying to do it there's a big
[3:01:41.160 --> 3:01:45.960]  pr campaign because they know that they're under the gun and there's more people talking about
[3:01:45.960 --> 3:01:50.760]  the fed now than ever in the past and they're trying to do damage control but the fact that
[3:01:50.760 --> 3:01:57.560]  these bankers meet in secret i think this speaks speaks the loudly to what their agenda is they've
[3:01:57.560 --> 3:02:04.040]  got a secret agenda well there's no doubt about that i mean we've gone from the public not even
[3:02:04.040 --> 3:02:09.640]  knowing that the federal reserve was private to some polls as high as 91 that want to abolish
[3:02:09.640 --> 3:02:14.760]  the federal reserve i think the bottom line here is more and more the elites are cornered
[3:02:14.760 --> 3:02:20.040]  and this private corporate structure that's captured the us and use it as a vehicle of tyranny
[3:02:20.680 --> 3:02:23.960]  is in a lot of trouble but they're going to play the war card they're going to play
[3:02:23.960 --> 3:02:27.880]  the stage terror attack card wane when do you think they're going to play the card
[3:02:28.760 --> 3:02:33.960]  you know it's hard to say when they're going to do that but uh you know right now russia could have
[3:02:33.960 --> 3:02:40.360]  had had like a well over two feet of snow we may have another foot or more coming tonight
[3:02:41.320 --> 3:02:48.360]  you can see how this town just grinds to a halt even with you know this this extreme weather so
[3:02:48.360 --> 3:02:55.000]  anything that would happen here just looking at how the city has just shut down the federal
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:02:59.800]  government has shut down for the second day in a row right now and maybe shut down for more days this
[3:02:59.800 --> 3:03:07.400]  week it doesn't take much and of course that's the weather but if it was a terror attack either
[3:03:07.400 --> 3:03:14.600]  in washington or some other major city of course they could play that card as you said and try to
[3:03:14.600 --> 3:03:24.520]  ram a bunch of a bunch more legislation through will they pull the terror card first before they
[3:03:24.520 --> 3:03:29.160]  go into iran or will they hit iran and then iran will actually fight back and that'll be called
[3:03:29.160 --> 3:03:35.400]  terrorism it's hard to say what their contingency is for this of course iran the worst-case scenario
[3:03:35.400 --> 3:03:41.720]  is iran will bottle up the straight of four moves they'll sink a couple of super tankers uh and uh
[3:03:41.720 --> 3:03:47.560]  and hit the refineries in uh Saudi Arabia and if that happens of course if you think gas prices
[3:03:47.560 --> 3:03:54.680]  are are pretty high now wait till they jump up uh so you know could be uh seven eight to ten dollars
[3:03:54.680 --> 3:03:59.720]  a gallon and that's what we'll see and then what last question why is china getting so mad at the
[3:03:59.720 --> 3:04:04.760]  us i mean we've shipped all our industry there uh we're letting them not have the carbon taxes
[3:04:04.760 --> 3:04:10.520]  when we're going to have them uh why is china threatening the us so much right now well i
[3:04:10.520 --> 3:04:15.560]  think they've found you as uh intelligence fingerprints on the riots in in uh in singh
[3:04:15.560 --> 3:04:22.440]  yang province and the Uyghur region of course uh soros was known that was been uh involved in
[3:04:22.440 --> 3:04:28.040]  in the Tibetan uprising and of course the selling of weapons to taiwan these are all
[3:04:28.040 --> 3:04:34.280]  you know china considers and we recognize taiwan as part of china and uh this is uh just like
[3:04:34.280 --> 3:04:39.720]  tweaking the the nose of the dragon remember during the cold war we they said we tweaked
[3:04:39.720 --> 3:04:44.920]  the nose of the uh russian bear now we're tweaking the nose of the chinese dragon and i think it's
[3:04:44.920 --> 3:04:51.480]  all this power politics to return to the old days of some neocold war i agree they're saying they've
[3:04:51.480 --> 3:04:56.040]  kicked it back off and of course the real target's us the american people but the globalists know
[3:04:56.040 --> 3:04:59.400]  we'll tend to go along with their tyranny if they're menacing us with outside threats
[3:04:59.400 --> 3:05:06.440]  wane madson thank you hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[3:05:06.440 --> 3:05:11.160]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[3:05:11.960 --> 3:05:16.920]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath americans at home i have tremendous influence
[3:05:16.920 --> 3:05:22.840]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all
[3:05:22.840 --> 3:05:29.320]  of us as american citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation

[3:09:45.320 --> 3:09:50.680]  go along with sarah palin's attempt to take over the tea parties and we do need to start having
[3:09:50.680 --> 3:09:57.160]  coffee parties to wake up the tea party people from the neocon fraud that's a great idea so
[3:09:57.160 --> 3:10:02.680]  you heard it here first the coffee parties great ideal listeners step in texas thanks for holding
[3:10:02.680 --> 3:10:07.880]  it on the air yes uh sure you've had a great show over the last three four weeks just mind
[3:10:07.880 --> 3:10:12.520]  mind blowing stuff um wanted to talk about two two things i would love if you would ask
[3:10:13.240 --> 3:10:18.760]  picture mattin about this he would be perfect to to answer this and that is two events that have
[3:10:18.760 --> 3:10:25.800]  occurred in our world's history that i feel are very important to where we are now which is first
[3:10:25.800 --> 3:10:32.920]  the house of Rothschild in britain in france convincing the confederacy to rise up and then
[3:10:32.920 --> 3:10:38.920]  having that loss and then the house of wrath uh Rothschild convincing the germans to go with
[3:10:38.920 --> 3:10:46.360]  the nazis to rise up and they had the same fate both uh both of these events are critical to our
[3:10:46.360 --> 3:10:52.840]  world uh for for the simple reason that when the confederacy uh you know rise up we went
[3:10:52.840 --> 3:10:58.520]  into a national state of emergency we've never left that national state of emergency if you
[3:10:58.520 --> 3:11:07.080]  read the u.s. senate report nine three five four nine which was done in 1973 it says we are still
[3:11:07.080 --> 3:11:13.560]  under national state of emergency yes that that the quote and i will quote for them right now
[3:11:13.560 --> 3:11:21.160]  that the normal function of the federal government has been suspended e i the constitution i'm so
[3:11:21.160 --> 3:11:28.520]  and that's why these executive orders can operate yes i'm so sick of quote freedom people thinking
[3:11:28.520 --> 3:11:36.280]  you're free you know get your head out of the uh sand we've been a syrup since uh 1860 exactly
[3:11:36.280 --> 3:11:42.200]  at palin and obama it's all a distraction the offshore banks illegitimately running our country
[3:11:42.200 --> 3:11:48.040]  is the only issue thank you step and that's why we need to found coffee parties to wake up the tea
[3:11:48.040 --> 3:11:54.760]  parties what a great idea curtis in canada you're on the air go ahead hey uh i just wanted to talk
[3:11:54.760 --> 3:11:59.480]  about the internet for a second um i know all this uh this is uh all in the news now about
[3:11:59.480 --> 3:12:04.680]  the internet getting shut down uh were you aware of um this department of defense uh it was the
[3:12:04.680 --> 3:12:10.280]  da rpa network challenge where they uh had uh like 10 what weather balloons scattered all across
[3:12:10.280 --> 3:12:17.080]  the united states and it took the team from mit about uh nine hours to find them all uh just
[3:12:17.080 --> 3:12:26.760]  using um uh just using the internet and social networks and whatnot yes yeah uh isn't it kind
[3:12:26.760 --> 3:12:34.280]  of strange that like like it's the department of defense that's doing this um i i agree that we
[3:12:34.280 --> 3:12:39.000]  need to stop this internet this uh second internet from coming in but i mean if all
[3:12:39.000 --> 3:12:45.880]  us fails like can we just start hoarding data and uh you know books manuals uh gardening books
[3:12:46.520 --> 3:12:52.440]  schematics on how to build generators solar panels yes curtis curtis curtis absolutely
[3:12:52.440 --> 3:12:55.320]  i agree with your call let me comment on this it's a very important issue
[3:12:58.360 --> 3:13:03.960]  right now with the internet open and free we are exponentially growing i mean look at my website
[3:13:03.960 --> 3:13:09.320]  you look at our radio listeners online we're on amon FM as well if you look at every level
[3:13:10.840 --> 3:13:18.600]  our numbers are exploding and i'm just one benchmark one gauge i can be in montana california
[3:13:18.600 --> 3:13:29.240]  new york florida central america canada england and before it'd be like one out of 20 people
[3:13:29.240 --> 3:13:36.360]  that walk past me would stop and say alex jones i'm a fan now it's like half of them and again
[3:13:36.360 --> 3:13:42.040]  that's a gauge of how many people we've woken up i'm just alex jones sure we're the biggest thing
[3:13:42.040 --> 3:13:46.120]  in the awakening the biggest thing in the liberty movement worldwide against the globalist but
[3:13:46.120 --> 3:13:54.040]  we're small in the overall aggregate and so we want to fight and keep the web free and open it
[3:13:54.040 --> 3:13:59.400]  isn't a new internet it's a stunted controlled internet as well internet to us we've been warning
[3:13:59.400 --> 3:14:03.480]  about now for six seven years and now it's all coming true because we're reading their own manuals
[3:14:03.480 --> 3:14:07.160]  it's not like i'm predicting this that they say what they're going to do now they're out in the
[3:14:07.160 --> 3:14:11.160]  open which means they're moving they're getting ready for a new war that's when they'll launch
[3:14:11.160 --> 3:14:16.120]  this internet control they'll launch fake attacks on themselves and shut it down so i've always said
[3:14:16.120 --> 3:14:21.960]  have a dual operation you know don't just have one website have two if you're an average person we
[3:14:21.960 --> 3:14:28.840]  have like 20 or so or more uh don't just uh you know i don't just have a radio show i make films i
[3:14:28.840 --> 3:14:34.280]  make other videos i write books i publish books i make other i produce other videos i support other
[3:14:34.280 --> 3:14:39.880]  people i have other activists on i do banner hang contest to show you the power of that it becomes
[3:14:39.880 --> 3:14:47.400]  international sensation we're illustrating your power and so you're on the internet you fight for
[3:14:47.400 --> 3:14:54.680]  the internet but you also at the grassroots hoard the info as a backup to give to people and the most
[3:14:54.680 --> 3:14:59.240]  effective thing is not just some internet it's to make copies of my films and give them to people the
[3:14:59.240 --> 3:15:06.520]  power of that is seismic i mean it's it's just unbelievably big and so you attack on all fronts
[3:15:06.520 --> 3:15:10.200]  they're shutting access tv down around the country they've shut down close to half of them
[3:15:10.200 --> 3:15:15.000]  use the others that are still there defend them support them go to city council go to county
[3:15:15.000 --> 3:15:21.240]  commissioners put my films on do your own show again it's all a concert calling to talk radio
[3:15:21.240 --> 3:15:25.960]  letters to the editor uh call local tv and newspapers and tell them what you'd like to see
[3:15:25.960 --> 3:15:30.840]  them report on a lot of these reporters aren't bad they're just ignorant there's an awakening
[3:15:30.840 --> 3:15:34.840]  happening and as more people wake up the more people are speaking out the harder it is for the
[3:15:34.840 --> 3:15:39.000]  globalist to censor and if they come in and try to censor the web as they're doing now and we
[3:15:39.000 --> 3:15:43.800]  scream bloody murder and get the word out and point out this is happening it'll blow up in their face
[3:15:43.800 --> 3:15:48.200]  our information will get even more readers and viewers and it'll be harder for them to try it
[3:15:48.200 --> 3:15:55.720]  again you fight you resist resistance is victory let's go back to the calls here let's talk to
[3:15:55.720 --> 3:16:04.040]  chris in georgia you're on the air hey alex uh well happy birthday buddy have a good one uh you
[3:16:04.040 --> 3:16:09.240]  you're right uh really enjoyed your conversation with uh Wayne madston uh when he got into the
[3:16:09.240 --> 3:16:15.240]  quadrillions of derivatives that's something that uh i think some are very underestimated under
[3:16:15.240 --> 3:16:20.440]  under talked about you know i think uh it's the globalist power that's where they get their power
[3:16:20.440 --> 3:16:25.160]  well it's it's it's a power numbers and that they've they've got everybody in such uh
[3:16:25.160 --> 3:16:29.640]  goldman sacks and some of the other people will kill for a hundred dollars and the globalists
[3:16:29.640 --> 3:16:34.040]  just make it out of nothing well and then you know there's out of control i think i think the
[3:16:34.040 --> 3:16:39.080]  speed in the processing everything is coming so fast and so furious that that no one can control
[3:16:39.080 --> 3:16:44.360]  it with the the information age etc it's just getting worse i mean you talk about them taking
[3:16:44.360 --> 3:16:50.440]  over our 401ks you taught y'all mentioned the money market issues more than ten states have
[3:16:50.440 --> 3:16:56.040]  remote control thermostats to control your thermostats well i mean did the money market
[3:16:56.040 --> 3:17:00.440]  issues i mean it's the safest investment the world and now if i've got a hundred thousand
[3:17:00.440 --> 3:17:04.440]  dollars in the bank and i want to go down and get it out they can say no you can't have your money
[3:17:04.440 --> 3:17:08.280]  i mean that's a load of poo right there you know the south carolina thing but you know
[3:17:08.280 --> 3:17:13.160]  the bottom line is do you have any sort of emergency thing you do you all some wonderful
[3:17:13.160 --> 3:17:17.720]  stuff and you have 20 websites whatever is there some dedicated shortwave radio
[3:17:18.840 --> 3:17:24.360]  you know that we can all go to when they finally do take it away i mean is there some plan that
[3:17:24.360 --> 3:17:30.520]  we have that yes we have fun you can we have phone backup to w w c r they carry four hours
[3:17:30.520 --> 3:17:37.480]  during the day live and four hours nine p.m to one a.m central so 11 a.m to three p.m central
[3:17:37.480 --> 3:17:42.440]  is live on w w c r best shortwave outlet out there a hundred thousand smoking watts
[3:17:42.440 --> 3:17:48.920]  and then they rear us nine to one a.m and so yes we will if they shut us off the internet
[3:17:48.920 --> 3:17:54.200]  we're going to still uh beef we have phone backups and other backups to our stations
[3:17:54.200 --> 3:17:59.880]  to shortwave and we're going to try well we got it we do you know if they do shut it down we need
[3:17:59.880 --> 3:18:05.000]  some way to keep it going we need some way for at least the dedicated listeners to be able to
[3:18:05.000 --> 3:18:09.400]  tune in and keep get the word out one way and that's up to listeners we've got those backup
[3:18:09.400 --> 3:18:15.640]  systems we've got a system where how many people can can can call free and listen over the phone
[3:18:16.280 --> 3:18:20.680]  i mean it's it's not a iphone thing it's it's an analog phone line how many people can listen
[3:18:20.680 --> 3:18:27.400]  we have two systems one is a volunteer who who does it out of michigan and the other we pay for
[3:18:27.400 --> 3:18:32.760]  twenty five hundred dollars a month callable is the sponsor but it costs twenty five hundred
[3:18:32.760 --> 3:18:41.880]  ask one of the it guys i think it's how many i yeah i think it's it but but again then we'd
[3:18:41.880 --> 3:18:45.560]  have to go to the subscription service if we we were going to have a hundred thousand people
[3:18:45.560 --> 3:18:49.320]  listening on the phone lines because we couldn't pay for it but right now i know it's thousands
[3:18:49.320 --> 3:18:53.400]  every day we you know we try to put these different backup systems in
[3:18:58.040 --> 3:19:01.960]  no it is not five thousand people that can listen over the phone system you'll have to ask one of
[3:19:01.960 --> 3:19:08.440]  the it guys okay i hope that answers your question sir is is that it chris uh yeah that's pretty much

[3:25:36.600 --> 3:25:40.040]  globalist have already picked their targets but if we expose them they won't be able to carry it out
[3:25:40.040 --> 3:25:43.880]  but i agree they've really been hyping terror at that event so we need to be very watchful

[3:34:38.920 --> 3:34:45.720]  we'll be back here's the real sarah palin don't say you haven't been warned about sarah palin
[3:34:45.720 --> 3:34:51.160]  don't say you haven't been warned you know i cut my teeth exposing bill clinton as a traitor to
[3:34:51.160 --> 3:34:55.720]  this country and going after our second amendment our national sovereignty and george bush tripled
[3:34:55.720 --> 3:35:01.000]  the size of government past the patriot act homeland security yes obama reissued it but
[3:35:01.000 --> 3:35:07.960]  the point is that was by artisan it gives obama left cover he's expanding wars biggest defense
[3:35:07.960 --> 3:35:13.480]  budgets ever continuing torture secret arrest and the phony right wing comes out and attacks him as
[3:35:13.480 --> 3:35:20.680]  a peacenik barack obama is a corporate whore barack obama works for the big banks barack obama is
[3:35:20.680 --> 3:35:27.800]  there to bring a form of fake neo liberalism into the united states and worldwide to continue the
[3:35:27.800 --> 3:35:35.080]  empire's corruption and it's the same thing for sarah palin vetted by henry kissinger anybody
[3:35:35.080 --> 3:35:42.200]  chosen to be the running mate of john mccain is a nightmare if there was any doubt about the true
[3:35:42.200 --> 3:35:49.640]  colors of sarah palin it is now 100 clear that she is a fraud and a warmonger and a neocon
[3:35:49.640 --> 3:35:57.080]  that will rape you even worse than george w bush did it's simple 9 11 has been used to target the
[3:35:57.080 --> 3:36:02.840]  american people instead of a police state do you understand that we have the secret mayak and homeland
[3:36:02.840 --> 3:36:07.800]  security reports that were leaked to us by law enforcement a year ago people couldn't believe
[3:36:07.800 --> 3:36:13.080]  their contents for four or five days until the government admitted they were real the main focus
[3:36:13.080 --> 3:36:18.280]  of homeland security and domestic military operations under north com is suppressing the
[3:36:18.280 --> 3:36:25.000]  states and the governors and we the people the whole thing is targeted at returning veterans
[3:36:25.000 --> 3:36:31.960]  gun owners christians conservatives libertarians that's in the documents all 50 states issued these
[3:36:31.960 --> 3:36:37.320]  via the federal government but what is sarah palin doing she's saying we need to expand the
[3:36:37.320 --> 3:36:42.200]  patriot act she says we don't need a constitutional lawyer we need a president really america is the
[3:36:42.200 --> 3:36:47.160]  bill of rights and constitution what's her problem with obama he's continued secret arrest he's
[3:36:47.160 --> 3:36:51.560]  continued torture he's expanded the wars he's brought us the two biggest defense budgets in
[3:36:51.560 --> 3:36:57.160]  history she supported the banker bailout that you supported palin along with glenn beck and
[3:36:57.160 --> 3:37:03.480]  george w bush what's the problem with obama the truth is it's a stage w w f wrestling event
[3:37:03.480 --> 3:37:10.040]  and the american people know this it was three years ago at the start of the republican campaign
[3:37:10.040 --> 3:37:16.600]  for the primaries that true tea parties were formed against both political parties for ron paul
[3:37:16.600 --> 3:37:24.440]  to truly call for our republic to be restored and now look at us three years later in 2009
[3:37:24.440 --> 3:37:30.440]  in january at tea parties in texas governor rick perry who supports the north american union
[3:37:30.440 --> 3:37:35.640]  seizing 8 000 miles of texas roads turning them into toll roads who supports making girls take
[3:37:35.640 --> 3:37:40.360]  garthasil shots when it's not even the law it was killing a bunch of people rick perry a
[3:37:40.360 --> 3:37:44.760]  builder bird group attendee calling for world government that's in the dallas morning news
[3:37:44.760 --> 3:37:51.880]  rick perry was being booed everywhere at tea parties so was senator cornyn other neocon
[3:37:51.880 --> 3:37:56.280]  republicans were being booed but the republican party came in and took over the tea parties
[3:37:56.280 --> 3:38:00.760]  and now they've officially done it with sarah palin and glenn beck it's run by the rnc that's
[3:38:00.760 --> 3:38:06.280]  who chartered tea party nation that's who funds these events and then sarah palin gets up in
[3:38:06.280 --> 3:38:11.400]  front of the tea parties and says we need to have war with iran right now that's the only thing
[3:38:11.400 --> 3:38:17.400]  that'll save obama's administration how hard do you think president obama will be to defeat in 2012
[3:38:17.400 --> 3:38:23.400]  it depends on a few things say he played and i i got this from bucanon reading one of his
[3:38:23.400 --> 3:38:30.440]  columns the other day say he played the war card say he decided to declare war on iran or decided
[3:38:30.440 --> 3:38:34.840]  really come out and do whatever he could to um support israel which i would like him to do but
[3:38:35.960 --> 3:38:39.640]  that changes the dynamics and we're not suggesting that he would cynically play the
[3:38:39.640 --> 3:38:44.680]  war card i'm not suggesting that i'm saying if he did things would dramatically change if he decided
[3:38:45.480 --> 3:38:52.520]  to tough it up and do all that he can to secure our nation and our allies the neocons last week
[3:38:52.520 --> 3:38:58.440]  wrote three editorials calling for this to happen she supports the patriot act she supports secret
[3:38:58.440 --> 3:39:04.360]  arrests she supports torture and all of this is designed for the american people it's a bait and
[3:39:04.360 --> 3:39:12.760]  switch ladies and gentlemen we have the internal documents and then in texas on super bowl sunday
[3:39:12.760 --> 3:39:18.920]  in houston she gets up and endorses rick perry and she says he's gonna send a message to washington
[3:39:18.920 --> 3:39:23.880]  i can't tell you though how proud i am to get to support the governor rick perry who better to
[3:39:23.880 --> 3:39:30.760]  lead than the successes that we already see here in texas i look forward to texas sending
[3:39:30.760 --> 3:39:36.520]  washington a message on how things can be done right because you're doing it right in texas
[3:39:37.080 --> 3:39:41.400]  rick perry is a total horror of washington he supported the banker bailout just like palin
[3:39:41.400 --> 3:39:46.680]  and beck did just like bush did because as many congressmen have said the foreign banks run this
[3:39:46.680 --> 3:39:52.920]  country that's the issue getting past the puppets of obama and palin to the real elite meanwhile
[3:39:52.920 --> 3:39:58.760]  deba madina who says that she will secure our borders give us open carry vermont style true
[3:39:58.760 --> 3:40:04.200]  second amendment she has said that she will get rid of all these illegal unlawful toll roads the
[3:40:04.200 --> 3:40:08.120]  state of texas the legislature already said they were illegal perry doesn't care he's going ahead
[3:40:08.120 --> 3:40:12.200]  with it won't even let the legislature see the contract for this nap a super highway system
[3:40:12.760 --> 3:40:17.560]  she said she will completely get rid of the unconstitutional property tax that makes you a
[3:40:17.560 --> 3:40:24.520]  surf who pays rent on your own supposed home not rick perry rick perry is new world order
[3:40:24.520 --> 3:40:28.920]  and a year ago he started talking like the tea parties because he understood that that was the
[3:40:28.920 --> 3:40:34.440]  future this is the real rebellion against the globalist against the copenhagen tax against
[3:40:34.440 --> 3:40:39.640]  the takeover but rick perry's saying nothing about austin announcing 2.6 billion in taxes
[3:40:39.640 --> 3:40:49.160]  in the next three years of carbon taxes so she's calling for war with iran and saying that obama
[3:40:49.160 --> 3:40:55.320]  can get his approval ratings up by launching an attack on iran that could start world war three
[3:40:55.320 --> 3:41:02.200]  that's a direct neocon talking point she was vetted by kissinger she was chosen by john mccain as
[3:41:02.200 --> 3:41:07.800]  her running mate the anti-gun attacker of free speech with mccain fine gold the guy that supported
[3:41:07.800 --> 3:41:13.800]  the bailout what else do you need to know and she gets up and pushes the main line republican
[3:41:13.800 --> 3:41:20.520]  garbage that's killing the republican party and a bunch of lap dogs with her phony uh
[3:41:20.520 --> 3:41:27.240]  trite that this tart puts out start buying into it you're just like idiot obama supporters who
[3:41:27.240 --> 3:41:31.400]  really thought he was going to end the war and end torture and end the banker bailouts when
[3:41:31.400 --> 3:41:37.800]  he's completely run by it wake up stop being conned we don't have time to screw around we don't have
[3:41:37.800 --> 3:41:43.160]  time to be bamboozled again we don't have time to be idiots but here's the good news it took
[3:41:43.160 --> 3:41:48.280]  people six years to wake up to the fact in the polls that bush was a fraud it took people less
[3:41:48.280 --> 3:41:53.400]  than a year with obama and so they can go ahead and stick miss world war three sarah patlin in

[3:48:41.640 --> 3:48:47.480]  be clear they've already in the last year gotten everybody's front door gps under the fifth amendment

[3:50:29.720 --> 3:50:35.160]  they have no right they're setting a precedent that government agents secret police get to ask

[3:54:22.120 --> 3:54:30.600]  parry's at 39 hutch it's in 28 deborah medina 24 she's getting about five points a week some
[3:54:30.600 --> 3:54:38.600]  weeks she gets six some weeks she gets three but it's trending up we've got a month coming up
[3:54:39.160 --> 3:54:44.440]  in about what 10 days yeah 10 days early voting starts and we've got about a week or so after
[3:54:44.440 --> 3:54:50.120]  that into the elections we've got less than a month uh trending she'll be past hutchinson
[3:54:50.120 --> 3:54:54.600]  but they'll try to make up some scandal soon against medina they're afraid to get too much
[3:54:54.600 --> 3:55:02.280]  attention she'll pass hutchinson by early voting and may be able to beat parry how exciting is
[3:55:02.280 --> 3:55:08.680]  that information but sarah palins down here to prop up parry as i just talked about i meant to get
[3:55:08.680 --> 3:55:15.080]  more into the cyber security bill today i covered most of the news here it is poll medina closing

[3:55:27.320 --> 3:55:32.360]  keep fighting but regardless if she wins loses draws whatever the electronic voting machines
[3:55:32.360 --> 3:55:36.360]  will probably come into this for the globalist but that's the race in the hole but this message
