[00:00.000 --> 00:29.840]  you are listening to an info
[00:29.840 --> 00:41.680]  wars dot com frontline report it's alex jones
[00:41.680 --> 00:47.760]  i've never had it on my heart this sick feeling of how sad this is but we're in a defensive mode
[00:47.760 --> 00:51.760]  here and the president by the way i think's waited too long already
[00:54.320 --> 00:59.440]  hey alex jones is still on the air six days a week at info wars dot com
[00:59.440 --> 01:05.280]  free video streams are available at info wars dot com back slash show spread those links
[01:05.280 --> 01:11.360]  and be a part of the second american revolution against global tyranny you are all paul revere
[01:11.360 --> 01:16.160]  that is actually a normal real battle plan this is what you would do if our government wasn't full
[01:16.160 --> 01:21.760]  of criminals it admits that china runs california china runs hollywood and what president trump needs
[01:21.760 --> 01:26.080]  to do in a real emergency because this country's already so far gone this is probably the only
[01:26.080 --> 01:30.480]  double thing that actually could save it so again we don't like martial law folks this is
[01:30.480 --> 01:34.480]  what we've already been in we're already under a martial law that's hollywood chai com run
[01:34.480 --> 01:40.400]  trying to start a race war millions are pouring in diseases crime societies breaking down we're
[01:40.400 --> 01:47.040]  going bankrupt democrat internal documents admits that's the plan congress won't act so what does
[01:47.040 --> 01:53.520]  the president do under the constitution article four section four what trump is saying is is that
[01:53.520 --> 02:01.120]  there's a lawless total collapse and no order to any of this people who are worried about trump
[02:01.120 --> 02:06.400]  becoming an authoritarian need to have a reality check it's the authoritarianism of the left
[02:06.400 --> 02:11.040]  that is crushing the first amendment crushing our fair and free elections and overrunning
[02:11.040 --> 02:16.880]  our country and trump is finally standing up and saying you know what i'm going to fight for america
[02:16.880 --> 02:22.160]  and we the people need to support him and if trump needs to invoke the insurrection act and invoke
[02:22.160 --> 02:28.160]  the executive orders that obama left behind you know trump needs to use the powers that we the people
[02:28.160 --> 02:35.440]  granted him because we elected trump to defend america remember alex trump ran on build the wall
[02:35.440 --> 02:41.760]  drain the swamp lock her up trump ran on the platform of indicting the treasonous criminals
[02:41.760 --> 02:47.120]  inside america so trump is simply fulfilling his promises to the voters and the voters
[02:47.120 --> 02:51.360]  knew that trump was going to do this when we elected him and we want him to do it and we
[02:51.360 --> 02:55.840]  support him doing it so that's where we are today it's time to defend america we have the right to
[02:55.840 --> 03:02.000]  self-defense if the democrats ever seize power again they will gut this country they will destroy
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.480]  the second amendment they've already crushed the first amendment they will go door to door with
[03:06.480 --> 03:11.600]  gun confiscations and i think the radicalism of the left would actually lead this country to a
[03:11.600 --> 03:17.920]  point where leftists are executing christians door to door criminalizing scripture criminalizing
[03:17.920 --> 03:22.480]  the bible and literally hunting down and killing people well i have stacks of news where they're
[03:22.480 --> 03:27.680]  openly saying it in mainline sites kill all christians now this is their modus operandi
[03:28.480 --> 03:32.960]  we're not the radicals they've gotten to this point right now some disturbing new numbers on
[03:32.960 --> 03:37.520]  religious persecution across the world showing roughly 90 thousand christians were killed last
[03:37.520 --> 03:42.240]  year because of their faith any catalog is live from the line it'll leave us more for us now amy
[03:42.240 --> 03:47.760]  jenna that's one christian martyr every six minutes these numbers were put together by the
[03:48.320 --> 03:52.880]  center for the study of global christianity it's become clear that the radical left which is
[03:52.880 --> 04:00.080]  lawless cannot coexist in a fair and free society they do not honor elections unless they cheat and
[04:00.080 --> 04:06.560]  win them through through a ballot harvesting for example they do not honor the presidency that
[04:06.560 --> 04:13.120]  trump has they've tried to overthrow it they've engaged in treason we are in a state of war that
[04:13.120 --> 04:19.680]  trump is now fully recognizing and we the people need to support trump i have to emphasize this
[04:19.680 --> 04:25.680]  we do not encourage anybody to initiate any kind of a vigilante action or anything of that kind
[04:25.680 --> 04:32.960]  we want we the people to support trumps proper authority to go after the enemies of america
[04:32.960 --> 04:38.560]  who are operating within america and in fact i hope i don't know if trump is even thinking about this
[04:38.560 --> 04:44.960]  but i hope that trump would use the insurrection act to arrest the governor of california
[04:44.960 --> 04:49.680]  for aiding and abetting illegal aliens and what is your response to some republicans in this
[04:49.680 --> 04:56.160]  building who say that your executive order ignores the issue of human sex trafficking well i think
[04:56.160 --> 05:03.200]  there's a great new yorker piece that they should refer to nourish a probiotic friendly environment

[09:27.600 --> 09:32.560]  under globalist attack just like the european union was established to attack the nation states and
[09:32.560 --> 09:40.640]  absorb them to a larger system of bankruptcy uh into a world government and now this is the
[09:40.640 --> 09:47.920]  only act that the president can carry out that will have any chance of stopping what is unfolding
[09:47.920 --> 09:55.040]  they've built refugee centers all over central and south america they are bringing in invaders from
[09:55.040 --> 10:03.120]  all over the world there was an article about 200 african invaders called migrants at the texas
[10:03.120 --> 10:11.360]  border demanding to be let in over a hundred thousand a month are just released now into the
[10:11.360 --> 10:17.280]  united states it's estimated five times that aren't even being caught it's quiet at the dania beach
[10:17.280 --> 10:21.040]  border patrol station friday but broward and pomage county leaders say under a new trump
[10:21.040 --> 10:25.440]  administration immigration plan they've been told hundreds of migrants will be brought here beginning
[10:25.440 --> 10:29.920]  in just a few weeks the news came as a big surprise to florida governor ron desantis
[10:29.920 --> 10:36.880]  we cannot accommodate in florida um just dumping the unlawful migrants um into our state i think
[10:36.880 --> 10:44.160]  it'll tax our resources the schools the health care law enforcement state agencies millions and
[10:44.160 --> 10:50.320]  millions and millions are on their way the projections are dire the agency is now on
[10:50.320 --> 10:56.560]  track to apprehend more migrants crossing illegally in the first six months of this fiscal year
[10:56.560 --> 11:03.040]  than the entirety of fy 17 and at the current pace we are on track to encounter close to one
[11:03.040 --> 11:09.280]  million illegal aliens at our southern border this year you see the numbers where i says that
[11:09.280 --> 11:19.840]  on any given day it's double the previous records and some days it's triple the previous records
[11:19.840 --> 11:26.800]  i'm gonna say that again on an average day there are double the numbers of illegal aliens being
[11:26.800 --> 11:36.720]  caught coming in to the united states double on any given day the previous record some days it's
[11:36.720 --> 11:45.760]  triple the previous record and within that flow are thousands of criminals smugglers gang members
[11:45.760 --> 11:51.600]  and public safety threats that were sworn to protect this country from with up to 40 percent
[11:51.600 --> 11:57.840]  or more of our personnel in key sectors like el paso working to care for transport provide medical
[11:57.840 --> 12:02.560]  and hospital watch for families and children that means our security posture at the border
[12:02.560 --> 12:08.080]  is negatively impacted if you try to transit through mexico then you're allowed to come up
[12:08.080 --> 12:17.760]  and the united nations gives them $1,000 debit cards with no name on it per leg of the trip to
[12:17.760 --> 12:25.920]  get here from africa from europe from asia from the middle east via latin america a mastercard
[12:25.920 --> 12:32.080]  press release boasted mastercard and george soros announced plans called humanity ventures the
[12:32.080 --> 12:37.440]  enterprise could catalyze and accelerate economic and social development for vulnerable communities
[12:37.440 --> 12:43.360]  around the world especially refugees and migrants with the creation of humanity ventures soros could
[12:43.360 --> 12:49.200]  invest up to 50 million to make these solutions even more scalable and sustainable and now the
[12:49.200 --> 13:01.600]  dam has broken the floodgates are wide open and these individuals are pouring in in mash upwards
[13:01.600 --> 13:08.560]  of 30 percent of the so-called families that get caught aren't families they're adults smuggling
[13:08.560 --> 13:14.080]  children in many cases who've been kidnapped remember when you fly into the u.s. they check
[13:14.080 --> 13:20.800]  your id and make sure that your passport is real they might ask you 30 seconds of questions that's
[13:20.800 --> 13:26.880]  not against the fourth amendment you're at a national border but then if you just cross
[13:26.880 --> 13:32.720]  illegally you're loaded on buses and delivered to god knows where the sexual assault problem
[13:32.720 --> 13:39.200]  is just terrifying i mean well the doctors outborders clinics in mexico 30 of the women
[13:39.200 --> 13:44.240]  that come into those clinics have been sexually assaulted you said 30 yes i mean that's that's
[13:44.240 --> 13:50.320]  a devastating number uh we have women report every day uh last week we had a woman in real
[13:50.320 --> 13:55.200]  grand valley report that the smuggler sexually assaulted her on the riverbank as they arrived
[13:55.200 --> 14:00.880]  in the u.s. and remember the senate's own report last year admitted many of the children that came
[14:00.880 --> 14:08.560]  across under obama ended up in child sex slavery and were being trafficked ladies and gentlemen
[14:08.560 --> 14:13.840]  this is an incredibly historic time to be alive i've been encouraging trump since last year to
[14:13.840 --> 14:19.280]  declare a national emergency as commander-in-chief and then he can direct the defense department
[14:19.280 --> 14:26.000]  money as he sees fit under that emergency instead he declared a law enforcement emergency on funding
[14:26.720 --> 14:30.080]  to work with congress that's not a real national emergency
[14:32.400 --> 14:35.600]  Dwight the eisenhower in the late 50s declared this emergency
[14:37.760 --> 14:43.760]  when millions were coming in illegally and deported them no nation that doesn't control
[14:43.760 --> 14:50.000]  its borders is a nation any longer ladies and gentlemen again thank you for joining us on this

[15:37.440 --> 15:42.000]  democrats going back on the offensive against trump with all these made up witch hunts why isn't he
[15:42.000 --> 15:48.160]  going on the offense he says he is but he's paralyzed by the justice department now we have

[21:15.040 --> 21:23.200]  same feeling i have and it's a frustration too because then i say to myself am i being a coward
[21:23.200 --> 21:31.040]  because i'm not calling for offensive violent action against these people and i've looked at
[21:31.040 --> 21:36.160]  the tea leaves i've looked at every angle of it and they have to stage violence against us and
[21:36.160 --> 21:42.560]  blame it on us to make themselves the victims violence is not the way to go at this point
[21:43.120 --> 21:51.760]  offensively but when you have so many businesses so many tv stations so many news stations so
[21:51.760 --> 22:00.000]  many movies so many production houses openly saying attack nationalist attack trump supporters
[22:00.000 --> 22:09.600]  attack white people it's insane by the way the majority of so-called minorities aren't buying
[22:09.600 --> 22:17.520]  into this and are dismayed as well but with the captive populations in corporations and in big
[22:17.520 --> 22:23.680]  tech and in the coastal redoubts of the globalist like san francisco los angeles new york
[22:24.800 --> 22:32.880]  more and more people being led by leftist whites are actually adopting
[22:35.200 --> 22:41.760]  a literal hitlerian system but it's reversed against white people it's national socialism
[22:41.760 --> 22:49.760]  it has a global conquest view and its ethos is that brown people are inherently good
[22:50.320 --> 22:56.320]  white people are inherently bad and then to add the double think to it beyond 1984
[22:58.160 --> 23:03.280]  they run around calling everyone who's promoting classic americana classic
[23:03.280 --> 23:11.760]  Christian ethos of unifying everyone around christ and around loving each other and around
[23:11.760 --> 23:19.120]  building communities which historically builds incredible civilization they point their finger
[23:19.120 --> 23:28.720]  at us and say that we're nazis when we're the country that beat the nazis and they're the
[23:28.720 --> 23:36.480]  globalist setting up a european union literally envisioned by adolf a lewis hitler
[23:38.880 --> 23:46.640]  and picked up by the globalist after world war two globalism is the system of the british empire
[23:47.360 --> 23:52.880]  merging with the european elite and the asian elite for a world government the trilateral plan
[23:52.880 --> 23:59.120]  after world war two that's its definition in phd harvard level real politic
[24:02.400 --> 24:05.360]  but they think the public's a bunch of ignorant animals and so they just say
[24:06.480 --> 24:14.080]  it's made up there's no such thing here's an example just today without even looking for
[24:14.080 --> 24:23.760]  orwellian parallels of two articles with complete and total 1984 in your face people say oh it's
[24:23.760 --> 24:31.280]  an accident no it's not when you get to a certain point in authoritarianism you openly roll it out
[24:31.280 --> 24:35.840]  to crush and overwhelm your opposition and demoralize them this is a technique
[24:38.320 --> 24:42.480]  it's the opposite of denying what you're doing gas lighting that's been going on forever
[24:42.480 --> 24:47.360]  saying that's not a red fire engine when anybody can see it's a red fire engine or
[24:47.360 --> 24:53.040]  this coffee cup isn't white when it's white and having a group of experts tell you it's not white
[24:53.040 --> 24:58.800]  and you're insane that's gas lighting but the technique of just overwhelming and throwing
[24:58.800 --> 25:05.200]  it in your face and selling evil is good oh it's a woman's right to kill babies after they're born
[25:05.200 --> 25:14.160]  we were down at the anti-life event in austin yesterday billy weaver and katlyn vennett
[25:15.280 --> 25:21.120]  and the new thing is kill babies up to age three now you may have heard me say that for 20 plus
[25:21.120 --> 25:28.560]  years because that's the plan that's the next rollout but that's peter singer the professor
[25:28.560 --> 25:34.640]  who is the omnibudsman of the new rollout of eugenics we're going to have all that footage
[25:34.640 --> 25:38.480]  never before seen a few clips have already been put out on milly weaver's twitter but when she
[25:38.480 --> 25:42.640]  comes on in the third hour we're having to bleep it out and things right now there's cussing every
[25:42.640 --> 25:48.400]  few seconds obviously follow the cussing ball beep beep beep beep but you're going to hear we're
[25:48.400 --> 25:54.080]  going to kill babies up to age three that's the new mantra and here's the two new orwellian pieces
[25:55.360 --> 26:02.640]  new york times this is a quote pregnancy kills abortion saves lives it's a wonder humans were
[26:02.640 --> 26:08.800]  able to survive for millennia before lifesaving abortions were invented here's another one
[26:09.520 --> 26:17.040]  european commission unwittingly echoes 1984 slogan in controversial tweet what did they say
[26:18.560 --> 26:27.360]  what did they say the e u is peace the e u is freedom the e u is solidarity the e u is diversity
[26:27.360 --> 26:34.400]  the u is human rights the e u is opportunities vote or is peace freedom of slavery this is all
[26:34.400 --> 26:46.240]  throwing it in your face that's the goal that's the plan that is the operation and that's what
[26:46.240 --> 26:52.240]  they're doing now there's too much to cover for me to tell you what's coming up next segment but
[26:52.240 --> 26:57.440]  i'm going to get into what the end of the electoral college means and why the globalists want to break
[26:57.440 --> 27:04.960]  it because if you break it you break the country and it's over at least politically it will turn
[27:04.960 --> 27:12.480]  into a violent civil war in the next decade or maybe sooner i will also look at bizarre behavior
[27:12.480 --> 27:18.960]  by anderson cooper i've told everybody that behind the scenes these vanderbilt these rockefellers
[27:18.960 --> 27:28.240]  these rothschilds literally make demonic faces behind closed doors at their events they don't
[27:28.240 --> 27:33.360]  have their calm demeanor they have completely different faces like dr jackal mr hide more and
[27:33.360 --> 27:40.480]  more they're manifesting it like peter strock did in the testimony that's all coming up in the last
[27:40.480 --> 27:46.320]  segment of the sour lord montan's also joining us next hour on the latest in the huge e u elections
[27:46.320 --> 27:53.200]  that have the globalists so scared that said please remember just like our information is game changing

[33:41.760 --> 33:48.160]  and prison planet dot com double edged sword promoting info wars and say hey it's the forbidden

[34:08.080 --> 34:14.160]  party but when it comes to promoting info wars dot com online on the big tech giants facebook
[34:14.160 --> 34:20.080]  youtube twitter they have a lot of algorithms that either totally block it or restrict it that's why
[34:20.080 --> 34:25.200]  news wars and prison planet still gets passed most of it and then paul of course has launched
[34:25.200 --> 34:33.600]  summit dot news uh which gets through the sensors as well it has a lot of original content on it as
[34:33.600 --> 34:40.080]  well because this is an information war so please remember this is not a spectator sport
[34:40.080 --> 34:46.000]  you are men and women in the arena and i salute you and thank you for everything you do
[34:48.560 --> 34:55.120]  let me hit this first and then the bizarre behavior of people like anderson cooper that is
[34:55.120 --> 35:00.000]  not bizarre behavior at all i'm going to cover that next segment and then i'm going to get into
[35:01.680 --> 35:06.240]  even fox news says don't have children that's bad for the planet and then oh you'll be much
[35:06.240 --> 35:10.240]  happier if you don't have children and then oh let's abort children after they're born
[35:10.240 --> 35:17.120]  oh let's kill children up to age three well now cbs news disconnecting to spend time with your kids
[35:17.120 --> 35:24.880]  could sabotage your career that's right you need to work 18 hours a day for the system you don't
[35:24.880 --> 35:31.920]  want to have a family because well that'll sabotage your selfish life but even if you have children
[35:31.920 --> 35:39.200]  just turn them over to the nanny state turn them over to the system that ties right into
[35:39.200 --> 35:45.280]  feminist says family must be abolished to dismantle capitalism children and all of us will be raised
[35:45.280 --> 35:52.160]  in dormitories by the state that's actually the plan about a third of the chinese are raised
[35:52.160 --> 35:58.720]  similarly and you talk about low IQ you talk about depressed you talk about sad you talk about
[35:58.720 --> 36:07.200]  suicide these are like robots big study out today all developed countries IQs are plunging
[36:08.000 --> 36:14.880]  and it's not just bringing in the lowest IQ from third world countries which that is it we get the
[36:14.880 --> 36:23.760]  lowest IQ of the third world but everyone's IQs are dropping very very quickly IQ rates are dropping
[36:23.760 --> 36:29.760]  in many developed countries and that doesn't bode well for humanity oh really but but but all of
[36:29.760 --> 36:42.400]  the policies are to do that now let's let's let's get back to this the electoral college the united
[36:42.400 --> 36:51.760]  states has been the apple of the world's eye for 244 years because our electoral system
[36:51.760 --> 36:58.560]  fused ancient roman ancient greek ancient british common law ancient judaic law
[36:59.520 --> 37:09.520]  iraqoi nation systems from the iraqoi federation in the northwest into canada that was all there
[37:10.960 --> 37:18.720]  that is the system and it was so balanced it was so so good it had had checks and balances
[37:18.720 --> 37:22.960]  it didn't allow for dictators it didn't allow for too much concentration of power
[37:23.680 --> 37:29.840]  and what were you going to do if the north of the united states had three times the population
[37:30.480 --> 37:37.760]  of the south but that geographically uh the south was much larger you didn't want to have
[37:37.760 --> 37:44.080]  the majority of the north be able to set all the laws for the south because you just be replacing
[37:44.080 --> 37:52.160]  king george the third with northern voters it's called the tyranny of the majority in a classic
[37:52.160 --> 38:02.560]  democracy if 51 vote to kill you it happens actually in ancient Greece and when they had
[38:02.560 --> 38:07.920]  original pure democracy in one particular city state they had black stones for no white stones
[38:07.920 --> 38:13.760]  for yes and only the gentry elite could vote but it was a pure democracy and if they didn't like
[38:13.760 --> 38:20.960]  what you said there was no judge or jury there was the people's jury and they would put rocks in the
[38:20.960 --> 38:28.000]  bucket saying kill you and you would be thrown off a cliff or given hemlock and most of the famous
[38:28.000 --> 38:36.160]  philosophers actually were ordered to kill themselves uh that was of course Athens uh you might want
[38:36.160 --> 38:46.480]  to look into pure democracy 51% said kill somebody you are double dead now we have a constitutional
[38:46.480 --> 38:54.320]  republic or a liberal democracy liberal meaning smart uh liberal meaning empowered not not not
[38:54.320 --> 38:59.360]  the modern liberal uh term that means psychotic uh trader that hates humanity and loves death
[38:59.360 --> 39:05.840]  the real liberals are like more guns more property more technology more life more freedom more
[39:05.840 --> 39:12.160]  literature more art more more more more more more more problem is it then creates all these
[39:12.160 --> 39:20.560]  definite slime balls but i'm digressing so imagine you're somebody in liam you only get
[39:21.120 --> 39:26.080]  three members of the house representatives california how many do they have 50 something
[39:26.080 --> 39:32.240]  it's an incredible number look it up i forget but Wyoming gets two senators and so does california
[39:32.240 --> 39:37.920]  so see in the house you get represented by population but there's a check and a balance
[39:37.920 --> 39:45.040]  in case things get out of control in the house then there's a power of veto by the fact that your
[39:45.040 --> 39:51.440]  rural state still has those two senators and previous to the 17th amendment from 1913 the same
[39:51.440 --> 39:57.760]  day we got the federal reserve same day we got the irs our new system they took the senators away
[39:57.760 --> 40:04.880]  the senators weren't just a check on the house they were a check on the executive senators
[40:04.880 --> 40:11.520]  were from the states i was correct california has 53 i said 50 just off the top of my head and it
[40:11.520 --> 40:16.720]  was 50 something uh well i think Wyoming has to do two or three i forget let's look the point is
[40:16.720 --> 40:24.640]  is that is that it's it's a beautiful check and balance so that you have 50 states in a confederation
[40:24.640 --> 40:31.280]  13 states at that time and they foresaw civil war if you could have the tyranny of the majority
[40:31.280 --> 40:35.280]  vote away the rights of others and that kind of still happened with the civil war that came from
[40:35.280 --> 40:42.560]  the 1860s so i was correct Wyoming has three votes so three votes in Wyoming and the house
[40:42.560 --> 40:48.640]  representatives three three representatives versus 53 in california but if california and
[40:48.640 --> 40:54.400]  others vote to say take the water rights or take the property of Wyoming there will be senators
[40:54.400 --> 41:00.400]  in the senate who can get together in a coalition and veto that but in a microcosm the state of
[41:00.400 --> 41:10.240]  california doesn't have a check and balance on its counties and so that's why la and of course
[41:10.240 --> 41:16.000]  san francisco have voted to turn everyone else into vassals they don't get surface rights they
[41:16.000 --> 41:20.480]  don't get water rights and they take everybody else's water and they jack up taxes on them in
[41:20.480 --> 41:27.840]  rural areas and they take the money it's called the tyranny of the majority so our system isn't
[41:27.840 --> 41:36.480]  perfect and so you don't want two or three states in a popular vote being able to presidentially
[41:36.480 --> 41:42.080]  out vote everybody else but getting rid of the electoral college goes far beyond that it completes
[41:42.080 --> 41:46.640]  what the globalist tried to do in 1913 with the federal reserve and the 17th amendment
[41:47.520 --> 41:54.400]  where senators used to be elected by the house or the legislature in their state i'm going to
[41:54.400 --> 42:01.600]  explain that again they would have votes in the state legislatures over who their senator was
[42:01.600 --> 42:10.000]  they were going to send so that it was a federal office but it was a creature of the state giving
[42:10.000 --> 42:16.880]  the state direct veto power into the senate in case those senators got bought off so checks and
[42:16.880 --> 42:26.560]  balances inside checks and balances the world envy of the planet the closest to perfection
[42:26.560 --> 42:33.040]  you're going to find no one has denied it easy to rig parliamentary systems easy to rig other
[42:33.040 --> 42:39.680]  systems very hard to rig this one and that's why they want to get rid of it ladies and gentlemen
[42:39.680 --> 42:44.960]  and they're very close they're very close they've gotten most of the blue wall states to pass it

[46:22.000 --> 46:27.560]  five different types of caffeine
[46:28.240 --> 46:31.600]  five different types of caffeine
[46:31.600 --> 46:59.300]  And get the fish oiled.
[47:01.600 --> 47:06.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:31.600 --> 47:45.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Electoral College is one of the final roadblocks in the way of America becoming a total banana republic.
[47:45.600 --> 47:55.600]  Since 1913, with the establishment of the Private Federal Reserve and the 17th Amendment, we lost our U.S. senators being elected by state legislatures.
[47:55.600 --> 48:09.600]  We would elect a legislature, they would be a body that then controlled a senator and would elect him to six-year terms, but they could recall senators and remove them at any time.
[48:09.600 --> 48:16.600]  That meant the states had an incredible check and balance in the federal government, and it made the federal and state governments co-equal.
[48:16.600 --> 48:20.600]  Since then, the federal government became more imperial.
[48:20.600 --> 48:25.600]  Now, Hillary had illegal aliens voting, people voting in the names of dead people.
[48:25.600 --> 48:31.600]  Trump undoubtedly won the popular vote, but they claim she got 2.9 million votes more than him.
[48:31.600 --> 48:37.600]  Even though we're 340 million people in this country, not to mention 40 million illegal aliens.
[48:37.600 --> 48:39.600]  So think about that.
[48:39.600 --> 48:44.600]  Hillary, even by her own fraud, only supposedly won popular vote by 3 million.
[48:44.600 --> 48:50.600]  So they're brainwashing our young people, saying it's not fair.
[48:50.600 --> 49:01.600]  We're states, and there is a margin there for rural states to not be dominated by popular states and their votes.
[49:01.600 --> 49:10.600]  Because the forebears had seen this happen in the parliamentary system in England and other areas, so they put the checks and the balances in.
[49:10.600 --> 49:19.600]  You remove those checks and balances, it allows the central government to decide who gets the federal money disproportionately,
[49:19.600 --> 49:30.600]  and you go back into a new system where instead of a king, you have mob rule the tyranny of the majority or the 51% back to Athens, Greece,
[49:30.600 --> 49:37.600]  where if 51% voted to kill somebody, they would be killed.
[49:37.600 --> 49:41.600]  That is a pure Big D democracy and is a tyranny.
[49:41.600 --> 49:45.600]  We are a constitutional or a public.
[49:45.600 --> 49:58.600]  And now you've got all these states passing laws saying at the next presidential election, they're going to give their electors 100% to whoever gets the popular vote
[49:58.600 --> 50:05.600]  instead of splitting it up so that you still get a percentage it isn't winter take all.
[50:05.600 --> 50:17.600]  That is designed again to create this tyranny and enslave rural areas and it's incredibly dangerous and this country's done if they're able to get that completed.
[50:17.600 --> 50:24.600]  That's the facts and the real secret history of the Electoral College.
[50:24.600 --> 50:30.600]  It's a lot bigger than just the quote popular vote and it's genius by our forebears.
[50:30.600 --> 50:41.600]  Now, I've talked a lot about this over the years that when you get around globalist and their minions they act like demon possessed people.
[50:41.600 --> 50:46.600]  And hundreds of times on air I've imitated the type of faces they make.
[50:46.600 --> 50:56.600]  The average leftist acts very calm, very MPR, very monotone, very go to sleep.
[50:56.600 --> 51:00.600]  Everything's fine. Don't get agitated.
[51:00.600 --> 51:10.600]  Let this little Vanderbilt or Rockefeller minion or globalist minion or Rothschild minion or Chycom minion.
[51:10.600 --> 51:14.600]  Talk you to sleep. Aren't your eyelids getting heavy?
[51:14.600 --> 51:36.600]  Sleep, sleep, sleep. But more and more when Strach or Pelosi or Michael Moore or Anderson Cooper is confronted by something they don't like.
[51:36.600 --> 51:39.600]  They're not scripting this behind closed doors.
[51:39.600 --> 51:43.600]  This isn't some new thing they've come up with like they do in most cases.
[51:43.600 --> 51:49.600]  The face they make I've made many times on air and people have always screenshotted it and said, look, Jones looks crazy.
[51:49.600 --> 51:55.600]  But I have had politicians flashing at me. I've been around globalists with no cameras are on and this is what they do.
[51:55.600 --> 52:01.600]  This is the faces they make.
[52:01.600 --> 52:07.600]  Now, how many hundreds of times have I told you they do this?
[52:07.600 --> 52:10.600]  I mean, it's just I've observed it.
[52:10.600 --> 52:20.600]  I mean, I've been sitting there before when the cameras are off and I'm at some luncheon or something, you know, 20 years ago and they're like, you better watch it.
[52:20.600 --> 52:27.600]  And then you go out to abortion rallies, the pro abortion to show up and go, Satan power babies, we want the blood.
[52:27.600 --> 52:31.600]  So more and more they're manifesting who they are.
[52:31.600 --> 52:37.600]  So Judge Dean Pirro was on television talking about how the walls are really closing in on these crooks.
[52:37.600 --> 52:43.600]  And Cooper, when he does his demon targeting, does the exact same. I call it the snaking dance.
[52:43.600 --> 52:49.600]  And now there's 20 years of me making these faces on TV and telling you they do it.
[52:49.600 --> 52:55.600]  And as they go more insane, they're going to manifest and show you their real spirit.
[52:55.600 --> 53:01.600]  And again, this is real. How do they all make the same face, not being coached?
[53:01.600 --> 53:09.600]  They make a snake move. So again, if you're a radio listener, we'll post this video later from the live show at info wars.com.
[53:09.600 --> 53:13.600]  There's an article about it at news wars.com by Paul Watson.
[53:13.600 --> 53:32.600]  But let's go ahead and roll the short clip of Pirro talking with Cooper side by side.
[53:43.600 --> 53:47.600]  Criminals pointing fingers at each other to save their own hides.
[53:47.600 --> 53:55.600]  A version of true crime and the reality show survivor, the deep state exposed.
[53:55.600 --> 54:02.600]  Now I told you more than a year ago, former FBI director James Comey was ahead of his own crime family.
[54:02.600 --> 54:10.600]  So as the truth begins to come out, they're completely panicking. So that was part of the monologue that's in our article on news wars.com.
[54:10.600 --> 54:18.600]  You can see it. They got him so upset. Here's Cooper on his show with the audio turning into a demon on television. Here it is.
[54:18.600 --> 54:26.600]  No scripts, no rehearsals, just a gang of criminals pointing fingers at each other to save their own hides.
[54:26.600 --> 54:32.600]  A version of true crime and the reality show survivor.
[54:32.600 --> 54:40.600]  Now, I forgot to tell the crew this, but try to pull up Emperor Palpatine fighting Yoda or Emperor Palpatine killing Mace Windu.
[54:40.600 --> 54:47.600]  Because you notice Ian McDermott, one of the top six period actors in the world, lives in London and he's been around these people.
[54:47.600 --> 54:59.600]  And the face he makes when the Emperor is killing somebody is exactly the face these people make when you are not around a camera with them.
[54:59.600 --> 55:05.600]  And I'm telling you, I've always explained the whole wimpy, quiet act is an act.
[55:05.600 --> 55:15.600]  Reportedly from folks I've interviewed that know them well behind closed doors and at their events and at their parties at Scullin' Bones and then they don't just stop partying at Scullin' Bones.
[55:15.600 --> 55:22.600]  They do rituals till they die, Vanderbilt's, Rothschild's, Rockefeller's, you know, spirit cooking type stuff.
[55:22.600 --> 55:33.600]  In private, they all walk around like this together going, ah yes, same thing as under control, power is mine.
[55:33.600 --> 55:43.600]  Now, my hands have stuck into Bohemian Grove with me and while they're doing the ritual, Mike was like, oh, this is very nice and people were going, I'll be quiet.
[55:43.600 --> 55:51.600]  They were actually going, because I'm only imitating what it's like to be demon possessed.
[55:51.600 --> 55:58.600]  But when I talk about Obama and Hillary, Hillary and other people that have guarded her, everybody I know that's guarded her.
[55:58.600 --> 56:14.600]  From Blackwater to the Army to the CIA says that Hillary goes into trances and actually we'll just be on a helicopter in a car and just go, oh, and we'll just blink out.
[56:14.600 --> 56:25.600]  But she'll also start going, and we'll beat the ground and flop around and she hates dogs, bring a dog around her to sniff her bombs.
[56:25.600 --> 56:30.600]  She'll go, I hate that stupid animal, I'll have your ass fired.
[56:30.600 --> 56:35.600]  You don't look at me in the eyes, you scum, you military scum.
[56:35.600 --> 56:43.600]  This has been written about and she'll start throwing things going, and again, you think I'm joking folks, I'm not kidding.
[56:43.600 --> 56:48.600]  That's who, well, hell, you've seen the abortion demonstrations.
[56:48.600 --> 56:55.600]  These people show them go, we kill our children, Satan.
[56:55.600 --> 57:04.600]  So, I messed my hair up doing that.
[57:04.600 --> 57:07.600]  We're facing some very insane people.
[57:07.600 --> 57:09.600]  Can we play Strat 2 for them?

[1:00:20.600 --> 1:00:26.600]  Well, we're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:26.600 --> 1:00:37.600]  There's a little CIA Vanderbilt, the little golden boy, Anderson Cooper, making Emperor Palpatine faces while Judge Shedin Perot talks about the crime syndicate.
[1:00:37.600 --> 1:00:45.600]  It's a six-minute report. It's in the article on infowars.com and newswars.com that you should spread of Anderson Cooper flipping out.
[1:00:45.600 --> 1:00:54.600]  But this is the face more and more they make like Strock made. It's like a little, like a snake slithering and they're grimacing and snapping.
[1:00:54.600 --> 1:00:59.600]  And this is the demon, the anti-American demon that's in these guys.
[1:00:59.600 --> 1:01:05.600]  And as they get called out as criminals like Strock did or like Cooper is being called out because he's involved in all this.
[1:01:05.600 --> 1:01:12.600]  He then starts manifesting. So we're going to roll Judge Shedin Perot with him and Strock and Emperor Palpatine in the background.
[1:01:12.600 --> 1:01:36.600]  Radio listeners go to infowars.com forward slash show to see this. Here it is.
[1:01:36.600 --> 1:01:47.600]  This will be true reality TV. No scripts, no rehearsals, just a gang of criminals pointing fingers at each other to save their own hides.
[1:01:47.600 --> 1:01:54.600]  A version of true crime and the reality show Survivor. The deep state exposed.
[1:01:54.600 --> 1:02:06.600]  Now I told you more than a year ago, former FBI Director James Comey was ahead of his own crime family and that he ran the upper echelon of the FBI like an organized criminal enterprise.
[1:02:06.600 --> 1:02:14.600]  That was limited to the upper echelon. The rank and file wouldn't have tolerated this. Even Bill Barr questioned it.
[1:02:14.600 --> 1:02:27.600]  The thing that's interesting about this is that this was handled at a very senior level of these departments. It wasn't handled in the ordinary way that investigations or counterintelligence activities are conducted.
[1:02:27.600 --> 1:02:35.600]  It was sort of an ad hoc small group and most of these people are no longer with the FBI or the CIA or the other agencies involved.
[1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:51.600]  For the last two years he and his gang of McCabe and Struck and Baker and Page, Brennan and Clapper all rift on how horrible President Trump was calling him treasonous, a Russian puppet or a Russian asset.
[1:02:51.600 --> 1:02:58.600]  They got away with it primarily because the mainstream media was receptive to their hateful narrative.
[1:02:58.600 --> 1:03:06.600]  After all, these were men in high positions in our government protecting us from Russia and they needed to be respected.
[1:03:06.600 --> 1:03:19.600]  When truth be told, they were selling our democracy down the river. They were skilled at their jobs, leaking information to the media to get news stories to not only poison public opinion,
[1:03:19.600 --> 1:03:27.600]  but to create the basis to support a bloodless coup of a candidate and later President Donald Trump.
[1:03:27.600 --> 1:03:35.600]  Now like any criminal conspiracy, the players are arrogant and they think they're above the law, but mistakes are always made.
[1:03:35.600 --> 1:03:46.600]  Comey tells the president-elect the dossier is unverified. He presents it to the FISA court though as verified when he knew the truth long before.
[1:03:46.600 --> 1:03:57.600]  It was unverified and it was a political document, not an intelligence document, but he used it to spy on a presidential campaign.
[1:03:57.600 --> 1:04:02.600]  Yeah, I used the word spy. Deal with it.
[1:04:02.600 --> 1:04:07.600]  Andrew McCabe, former deputy director of the FBI, is under criminal investigation.
[1:04:07.600 --> 1:04:15.600]  He claims he's a victim in all of this and that his firing is a result of a tax designed to undermine him.
[1:04:15.600 --> 1:04:25.600]  As if anyone cares about Andrew McCabe. McCabe lies not only to the FBI, but to the Inspector General under oath. He's another leaker.
[1:04:25.600 --> 1:04:32.600]  It's no surprise that Attorney General Barr says he's still trying to get his arms around all of this.
[1:04:32.600 --> 1:04:42.600]  I thought when I came in from the outside that all the questions that I had and many other people had that would be readily answered once I got in.
[1:04:42.600 --> 1:04:52.600]  Folks, get the article. It's on NewsWars.com and spread it. CNN's Anderson Cooper, Mox Fox News host and making bizarre facial expressions appears to be possessed by a gremlin.
[1:04:52.600 --> 1:04:57.600]  He's now known as the third gremlin.
[1:04:57.600 --> 1:05:02.600]  Mike in New Jersey. You're on the air. Thanks for calling Mike.
[1:05:02.600 --> 1:05:06.600]  You are the man, Alex. I'm so glad to be talking to you. I'm so excited. I'm such a big fan.
[1:05:06.600 --> 1:05:11.600]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products. I got to do a shout out for the bone broth.
[1:05:11.600 --> 1:05:17.600]  The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth.
[1:05:17.600 --> 1:05:22.600]  Tastes like, tastes like, um, great milkshake. You know, if you just add it to milk.
[1:05:22.600 --> 1:05:28.600]  It tastes like oval theme. It tastes like oval theme. It tastes like oval theme. Like, good.
[1:05:28.600 --> 1:05:34.600]  I feel great since I've been taking it. My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride-free toothpaste.
[1:05:34.600 --> 1:05:40.600]  Um, I'd use the, uh, supermail vitality, a host of other products, so thank you so much for that as well.
[1:05:40.600 --> 1:05:44.600]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air. I'm thanking you, but yes.
[1:05:44.600 --> 1:05:49.600]  This is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom, the true bone broth.
[1:05:49.600 --> 1:05:52.600]  It is next level. It really is good, so thank you.
[1:05:52.600 --> 1:06:11.600]  Great. Since I've been taking it, thank you.
[1:06:11.600 --> 1:06:20.600]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:06:20.600 --> 1:06:25.600]  Breaking news out of Silicon Valley.
[1:06:25.600 --> 1:06:30.600]  Facebook has banned a number of prominent conspiracy theorists and alt-right figures.
[1:06:30.600 --> 1:06:34.600]  Facebook is purging several high-profile names from its platform.
[1:06:34.600 --> 1:06:38.600]  This may be one of the biggest and most impactful decisions Facebook has ever made.
[1:06:38.600 --> 1:06:41.600]  Facebook, making steps to enforce its hate speech policies.
[1:06:41.600 --> 1:06:49.600]  Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Lewis Farrakhan, Laura Loomer, all of them were designated dangerous.
[1:06:49.600 --> 1:06:50.600]  Dangerous?
[1:06:50.600 --> 1:06:51.600]  Dangerous.
[1:06:51.600 --> 1:06:52.600]  Dangerous people.
[1:06:52.600 --> 1:06:53.600]  Dangerous individuals.
[1:06:53.600 --> 1:06:54.600]  Dangerous individuals.
[1:06:54.600 --> 1:06:56.600]  Dangerous individuals and organizations.
[1:06:56.600 --> 1:06:59.600]  Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous.
[1:06:59.600 --> 1:07:00.600]  Danger, Will Robinson.
[1:07:00.600 --> 1:07:01.600]  Danger.
[1:07:01.600 --> 1:07:02.600]  They call me dangerous.
[1:07:02.600 --> 1:07:03.600]  Danger is my middle name.
[1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:09.600]  Dangerous like burning other people or dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like.
[1:07:09.600 --> 1:07:14.600]  This is about the total rollout for complete and total censorship.
[1:07:14.600 --> 1:07:15.600]  How dangerous is info?
[1:07:15.600 --> 1:07:20.600]  What is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and infowars.com?
[1:07:20.600 --> 1:07:23.600]  Info wars tells viewers that the world is out to get them.
[1:07:23.600 --> 1:07:25.600]  None of this seems to repel President Trump.
[1:07:25.600 --> 1:07:27.600]  Info wars content is useful to him.
[1:07:27.600 --> 1:07:30.600]  Info wars personalities align with him.
[1:07:30.600 --> 1:07:31.600]  I want them shut down.
[1:07:31.600 --> 1:07:32.600]  I want them silenced.
[1:07:32.600 --> 1:07:33.600]  I want them muted.
[1:07:33.600 --> 1:07:35.600]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[1:07:35.600 --> 1:07:36.600]  I want them shut down.
[1:07:36.600 --> 1:07:37.600]  I want them silenced.
[1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:38.600]  I want them muted.
[1:07:38.600 --> 1:07:42.600]  Because these corporations are controlled by a liberal view.
[1:07:42.600 --> 1:07:53.600]  We're very focused on making sure that our recommendations and discovery services aren't highlighting groups where people are repeatedly sharing misinformation or harmful content.
[1:07:53.600 --> 1:08:02.600]  And we're working hard to completely remove groups if they exist, primarily to violate our policies or do things that are dangerous.
[1:08:02.600 --> 1:08:03.600]  Screw your rules.
[1:08:03.600 --> 1:08:06.600]  Your rules go against our values and they are patently un-American.
[1:08:06.600 --> 1:08:09.600]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions.
[1:08:09.600 --> 1:08:13.600]  He's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have.
[1:08:13.600 --> 1:08:16.600]  We need a digital fill of rights.
[1:08:16.600 --> 1:08:20.600]  They are becoming the public square and they control how we interact with each other.
[1:08:20.600 --> 1:08:23.600]  And if you think that you are going to throw up your hands and say,
[1:08:23.600 --> 1:08:27.600]  well, they're private companies, you are absolutely insane and you are part of the problem.
[1:08:27.600 --> 1:08:28.600]  You are a bad person.
[1:08:28.600 --> 1:08:30.600]  You should be censored off the internet.
[1:08:30.600 --> 1:08:31.600]  Bad, yes.
[1:08:31.600 --> 1:08:32.600]  Get out of here, Alex.
[1:08:32.600 --> 1:08:37.600]  Info wars might have been banned from Twitter, but it seems to have found a new home over at Trump's Twitter feed.
[1:08:37.600 --> 1:08:46.600]  Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the Info Wars president.
[1:08:46.600 --> 1:09:15.600]  The most banned network in the world.
[1:09:15.600 --> 1:09:25.600]  Now they know that you're a pack of liars and they hate your guts forever.
[1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:27.600]  You're called CNN.
[1:09:27.600 --> 1:09:46.600]  You're called CNN.
[1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:48.600]  Gordon Monkton joins us at the bottom of the hour.
[1:09:48.600 --> 1:09:52.600]  CBS News says don't have kids or don't take care of your kids.
[1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:53.600]  It's bad.
[1:09:53.600 --> 1:09:57.600]  You can hurt your job performance.
[1:09:57.600 --> 1:09:58.600]  You need to be a good slave.
[1:09:58.600 --> 1:09:59.600]  Forget families.
[1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:00.600]  Forget humanity.
[1:10:00.600 --> 1:10:01.600]  That's all coming up.
[1:10:01.600 --> 1:10:03.600]  This is a post human globalist program.
[1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:12.600]  But Rob do put together a very powerful little four minute piece that I shot last night on globalism.
[1:10:12.600 --> 1:10:17.600]  It's particularly informative for TV viewers because it has all the graphic statistics and facts.
[1:10:17.600 --> 1:10:24.600]  But this deals with the real threat and who the controllers are and the crossroads that we are all now at.
[1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:28.600]  Here's that report.
[1:10:28.600 --> 1:10:43.600]  Remember just four or five years ago they would have articles in the New York Times, the Washington Post saying that globalists didn't exist and that no one wanted global government.
[1:10:43.600 --> 1:10:49.600]  Well, as soon as Hillary lost, they came out and said, OK, global government's real.
[1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:50.600]  Globalists are real.
[1:10:50.600 --> 1:11:00.600]  But they're the good guys and everyone against globalism is a white supremacist.
[1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:01.600]  Wow.
[1:11:01.600 --> 1:11:07.600]  You know where globalism came from.
[1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:11.600]  It came from the Nazis.
[1:11:11.600 --> 1:11:19.600]  They wanted a system to counter the British Empire that was the global power at that time.
[1:11:19.600 --> 1:11:24.600]  The old saying was the sun never set on the British Empire.
[1:11:24.600 --> 1:11:26.600]  And Hitler gave speeches.
[1:11:26.600 --> 1:11:27.600]  Hitler wrote articles.
[1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:39.600]  It was all over the news at the time that he wanted a European Union that would then dominate the globe in a form of globalism.
[1:11:39.600 --> 1:11:42.600]  So the term globalism actually comes from the Nazis.
[1:11:42.600 --> 1:11:48.600]  The modern Olympics symbols, the VW, the highways of NASA.
[1:11:48.600 --> 1:11:53.600]  I mean, they definitely innovated some stuff in their power grant.
[1:11:53.600 --> 1:11:56.600]  And I'm not saying this is a German or Nazi conspiracy.
[1:11:56.600 --> 1:11:58.600]  Hell, I'm half German myself.
[1:11:58.600 --> 1:11:59.600]  Germans are great people.
[1:11:59.600 --> 1:12:06.600]  But when harnessed by evil, good people can be like horses drawing the devil's carriage.
[1:12:06.600 --> 1:12:12.600]  And so ideas of the Nazis and ideas of the British Empire competed with each other.
[1:12:12.600 --> 1:12:17.600]  And big corporations picked up those ideas and that's modern globalism.
[1:12:17.600 --> 1:12:25.600]  So Info Wars is seen as the most pure strain of Americana by the globalist.
[1:12:25.600 --> 1:12:32.600]  I've talked to top people in Hollywood and entertainment and in media and in government.
[1:12:32.600 --> 1:12:36.600]  And they've said, Jones, you're seen as Americana.
[1:12:36.600 --> 1:12:39.600]  But they say as beautiful as Americana is.
[1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:41.600]  I'm not saying I'm beautiful, but Americana is beautiful.
[1:12:41.600 --> 1:12:48.600]  It stands in the way of the larger ideas of the planet and a one world government system.
[1:12:48.600 --> 1:12:55.600]  Well, humans are revolting against that one world government system and are saying they don't want to be under its hegemonic control.
[1:12:55.600 --> 1:13:03.600]  Their great truth that they're so sure is for us, isn't for us in different countries and parts of the world.
[1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:05.600]  We don't want to be under their control.
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:07.600]  We don't want to carry out their vision.
[1:13:07.600 --> 1:13:09.600]  We want to live our own lives.
[1:13:09.600 --> 1:13:15.600]  And that's what Info Wars represents and that's why they've set up a system to demonize us.
[1:13:15.600 --> 1:13:18.600]  They've set up a system to lie about us.
[1:13:18.600 --> 1:13:22.600]  They've set up a system to create this straw man of who we are.
[1:13:22.600 --> 1:13:30.600]  Because they understand that people don't do things for money or power at the end of the day.
[1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:32.600]  They do it because of narratives.
[1:13:32.600 --> 1:13:34.600]  They do it because of culture.
[1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:39.600]  They do it because of ethos and what they stand for.
[1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:45.600]  Well, some people may sell out for money, but people that really count do it for ideology.
[1:13:45.600 --> 1:13:50.600]  And the system knows that I'm trying to reboot, that you're trying to reboot,
[1:13:50.600 --> 1:13:54.600]  a system that competes with the British Empire.
[1:13:54.600 --> 1:13:56.600]  The British Empire called it the American System.
[1:13:56.600 --> 1:14:01.600]  Two hundred years ago, they said our system of empire will fail in competition with this.
[1:14:01.600 --> 1:14:03.600]  Hitler said the same thing.
[1:14:03.600 --> 1:14:07.600]  The truth is our system was the best of the greatest because it empowered individuals.
[1:14:07.600 --> 1:14:12.600]  And now it's fighting the very same systems of tyranny today.
[1:14:12.600 --> 1:14:14.600]  Join us at InfoWars.com.
[1:14:14.600 --> 1:14:18.600]  Join the human community and spread the word against the censorship.
[1:14:18.600 --> 1:14:21.600]  So we will prevail as we've done in the past.
[1:14:21.600 --> 1:14:28.600]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[1:14:28.600 --> 1:14:30.600]  I think that's a very powerful, straight talk.
[1:14:30.600 --> 1:14:32.600]  I don't even know what we should call that four-minute piece,
[1:14:32.600 --> 1:14:38.600]  but I'm going to have to do the crew post the next 20 minutes to InfoWars.com.
[1:14:38.600 --> 1:14:41.600]  And hopefully we'll get it out there.
[1:14:41.600 --> 1:14:44.600]  A breakdown like that would get 20 million views years ago on YouTube
[1:14:44.600 --> 1:14:48.600]  and probably shadowbanned us, then it would get a half million views.
[1:14:48.600 --> 1:14:50.600]  We were shadowbanned and now, of course, no views.
[1:14:50.600 --> 1:14:53.600]  But I just want to reach people. I just want a future.
[1:14:53.600 --> 1:14:57.600]  And you look at it all, the globalists say, yes, we don't like humans.
[1:14:57.600 --> 1:15:00.600]  Humans are bad. We're sabotaging the human community.
[1:15:00.600 --> 1:15:04.600]  They've gone from denying that and everything I talk about in in-game,
[1:15:04.600 --> 1:15:10.600]  a 12-year-old film, to now just admitting everything in our face.
[1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:12.600]  And that's because they know they can't hide it anymore.
[1:15:12.600 --> 1:15:14.600]  So instead, they want to just demoralize us.
[1:15:14.600 --> 1:15:18.600]  But I don't see that happening. I don't see them being successful.
[1:15:18.600 --> 1:15:27.600]  Okay, we have unbelievably important developments dealing with the trade war with China.
[1:15:27.600 --> 1:15:29.600]  Trump is winning. We are winning.
[1:15:29.600 --> 1:15:31.600]  I'm going to break that down when we come back.
[1:15:31.600 --> 1:15:34.600]  And we'll also look at European officials having to step down
[1:15:34.600 --> 1:15:37.600]  as they get caught working with the Islamic invasion.
[1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:39.600]  Big news on that front.
[1:15:39.600 --> 1:15:42.600]  George Monkton joins us. And then we have a lot of news.
[1:15:42.600 --> 1:15:46.600]  I told you a month ago they were trying to legalize Soylent Green in America.
[1:15:46.600 --> 1:15:49.600]  Washington just legalized eating people.
[1:15:49.600 --> 1:16:10.600]  That's right. We'll tell you about that coming up. Stay with us.
[1:16:19.600 --> 1:16:21.600]  I just need to know where to send it.
[1:16:49.600 --> 1:17:01.600]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[1:17:01.600 --> 1:17:03.600]  You don't know me and will never meet.
[1:17:03.600 --> 1:17:05.600]  I had a problem like you once.
[1:17:05.600 --> 1:17:09.600]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control
[1:17:09.600 --> 1:17:11.600]  and almost ruined my life.
[1:17:11.600 --> 1:17:16.600]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[1:17:16.600 --> 1:17:21.600]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[1:17:21.600 --> 1:17:24.600]  you need to call the national treatment advisors.
[1:17:24.600 --> 1:17:29.600]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:31.600]  and totally change your life.
[1:17:31.600 --> 1:17:37.600]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[1:17:37.600 --> 1:17:41.600]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse. Get clean.
[1:17:41.600 --> 1:17:57.600]  Call now and learn more.
[1:17:57.600 --> 1:18:01.600]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[1:18:01.600 --> 1:18:05.600]  They are technocrats. They are control freaks in their own words.
[1:18:05.600 --> 1:18:08.600]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions
[1:18:08.600 --> 1:18:12.600]  hits are the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[1:18:12.600 --> 1:18:14.600]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[1:18:14.600 --> 1:18:17.600]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[1:18:17.600 --> 1:18:22.600]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives
[1:18:22.600 --> 1:18:23.600]  is our bodies.
[1:18:23.600 --> 1:18:28.600]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from ForrestLife.com, I couldn't do it.
[1:18:28.600 --> 1:18:33.600]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[1:18:33.600 --> 1:18:38.600]  and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[1:18:38.600 --> 1:18:43.600]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter
[1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:44.600]  that you're going to find anywhere.
[1:18:44.600 --> 1:18:45.600]  It is amazing.
[1:18:45.600 --> 1:18:50.600]  Experience pure medical B12 for yourself and fund the Second American Revolution
[1:18:50.600 --> 1:18:57.600]  against the tyrants at InfowarsStore.com, InfowarsLife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[1:18:57.600 --> 1:19:04.600]  If not shut down our speech, we're at infowars.com and newswars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants.
[1:19:04.600 --> 1:19:07.600]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said,
[1:19:07.600 --> 1:19:08.600]  we used to love you on air.
[1:19:08.600 --> 1:19:11.600]  It was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[1:19:11.600 --> 1:19:13.600]  Are you coming back?
[1:19:13.600 --> 1:19:15.600]  We're at infowars.com.
[1:19:15.600 --> 1:19:16.600]  We're at newswars.com.
[1:19:16.600 --> 1:19:18.600]  Paul Watts has launched his own summit.news.
[1:19:18.600 --> 1:19:19.600]  We have our own videos.
[1:19:19.600 --> 1:19:20.600]  We have our own articles.
[1:19:20.600 --> 1:19:21.600]  They're trying to destroy us.
[1:19:21.600 --> 1:19:25.600]  But thanks to you and others having us on, Infowars are still checking along.
[1:19:25.600 --> 1:19:28.600]  So we're there folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[1:19:28.600 --> 1:19:31.600]  Infowars.com!
[1:19:31.600 --> 1:19:32.600]  Woo!
[1:19:34.600 --> 1:19:37.600]  Infowars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[1:19:37.600 --> 1:19:38.600]  I'm going about infowars.com.
[1:19:38.600 --> 1:19:41.600]  I'm at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[1:19:41.600 --> 1:19:42.600]  There you go.
[1:19:42.600 --> 1:19:44.600]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[1:19:44.600 --> 1:19:47.600]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[1:19:47.600 --> 1:19:50.600]  Anybody can use it, reupload it, do whatever you want.
[1:19:50.600 --> 1:19:52.600]  People go to infowars.com and newswars.com.
[1:19:52.600 --> 1:19:53.600]  That's where they find it.
[1:19:53.600 --> 1:19:55.600]  You know, there's, what things go websites.
[1:19:55.600 --> 1:20:24.600]  Things go there.
[1:20:24.600 --> 1:20:28.600]  The West is the best.
[1:20:28.600 --> 1:20:32.600]  And it's going to do the rest.
[1:20:32.600 --> 1:20:36.600]  And that's what the globalists want to take it down.
[1:20:36.600 --> 1:20:41.600]  Thank you, Jim, for bringing us in.
[1:20:41.600 --> 1:20:48.600]  The killer awoke before dawn put his boots on.
[1:20:48.600 --> 1:20:54.600]  And then he walked on down the hall.
[1:20:54.600 --> 1:20:59.600]  Down the hall of life, down the hall of destiny,
[1:20:59.600 --> 1:21:17.600]  past all those busts, all those that already came.
[1:21:17.600 --> 1:21:22.600]  I'm honored to have you here with me.
[1:21:22.600 --> 1:21:23.600]  I'll rate Lord Monke's story driveway.
[1:21:23.600 --> 1:21:35.600]  Where I can create mawkans.
[1:21:35.600 --> 1:21:43.240]  that there are massive amounts of colleges that are not black colleges, but
[1:21:43.240 --> 1:21:53.360]  there are colleges that have black only graduation ceremonies. That's the kind of
[1:21:53.360 --> 1:22:00.240]  stuff I got in my stack. You could talk all day about that, what that means. By
[1:22:00.240 --> 1:22:05.000]  the way, I think if people want to do that, they have a right to do it, but if you
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:10.440]  try to set up a whites-only organization, they try to make it illegal.
[1:22:10.440 --> 1:22:18.720]  They try to say it's racist. There's even been moves to shut down Celtic or Celtic
[1:22:18.720 --> 1:22:22.280]  events or whatever because you can't celebrate that again. That's not the
[1:22:22.280 --> 1:22:26.280]  blacks that want that. That's the establishment that wants to divide and
[1:22:26.280 --> 1:22:31.160]  conquer. Here's another one. Washington becomes first state to allow human
[1:22:31.160 --> 1:22:40.000]  composting. Burry me beneath the old apple trees so that I might touch thy
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:49.880]  lips again. Except the average human carries the largest bio-waste per pound
[1:22:49.880 --> 1:22:55.640]  of any animal on earth and is incredibly toxic. You've been to the hardware
[1:22:55.640 --> 1:22:59.600]  store, you've been to the Home Depot or wherever, you go to get fertilizer for
[1:22:59.600 --> 1:23:07.440]  your yard and it says not for food production, not for vegetables, not for
[1:23:07.440 --> 1:23:16.040]  any plants consumed by humans, because a lot of fertilizer is toxic waste from
[1:23:16.040 --> 1:23:22.840]  mines in the country and then they dump it on the plants and it's sent as runoff.
[1:23:22.840 --> 1:23:30.280]  But if you take humans, whose biomass of heavy metal and toxins and drugs and
[1:23:30.280 --> 1:23:35.640]  then you chop them up and you ground them up and you mix them in to dirt and
[1:23:35.640 --> 1:23:44.720]  then you sell it so that it's put on crops, how evil and sick and disrespectful
[1:23:44.720 --> 1:23:53.680]  is that? One thing if you want to get buried in a pine box or it's another
[1:23:53.680 --> 1:23:56.960]  thing if you can, you know, go out west and you're Native American and you got
[1:23:56.960 --> 1:24:02.040]  to try about there and they'll let you get laid out up there on a platform and
[1:24:02.040 --> 1:24:12.800]  you rot in the sun. Buzzards come over and have a dinner, find a meme. But the
[1:24:12.800 --> 1:24:19.840]  left said a decade ago or more that they want to make you be composted and they
[1:24:19.840 --> 1:24:25.720]  want to make people grow crops on it as a part of defiling everyone, debasing
[1:24:25.720 --> 1:24:33.560]  human life. It's all about seeing what they can get away with over and over and
[1:24:33.560 --> 1:24:37.600]  over and over. And I haven't even gotten to the ship, but I'll get to it next
[1:24:37.600 --> 1:24:43.000]  hour when Millie Weaver is in studio with us and beautiful video that she
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:47.720]  let us shoot of her three-month-old daughter because they just love to be
[1:24:47.720 --> 1:24:52.920]  able to vaccinate into oblivion. But disconnecting to spend time with your
[1:24:52.920 --> 1:24:57.640]  kids, sabotage your career, so don't spend time with your children, CBS News.
[1:24:57.640 --> 1:25:04.720]  You can't make up how evil these people are and their whole agenda that's been
[1:25:04.720 --> 1:25:11.560]  chest-stating, growing in our guts in the universities has now blown out both
[1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:17.280]  ends as the universities vomit out their poison and crap out their poison upon
[1:25:17.280 --> 1:25:20.880]  us and bleed out. It's coming out of their eyeballs.
[1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:42.880]  Death equals death, devil equals death, a little slogan there, it's coming bones.
[1:25:42.880 --> 1:25:50.080]  So what is this cultural phenomenon in history when society's going sane and
[1:25:50.080 --> 1:25:54.520]  when civilizations commit suicide? Lord Monkton's not just a former chief
[1:25:54.520 --> 1:26:03.800]  advisor to people in the British government like Margaret Thatcher or an
[1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:08.480]  inventor or the top guy exposing the carbon tax fraud, but he's quite a
[1:26:08.480 --> 1:26:13.360]  historian. I'm gonna ask him that question too. What is this madness that we see in
[1:26:13.360 --> 1:26:19.080]  the Nazis or the Soviets or the French Revolution or what's now upon the West?
[1:26:19.080 --> 1:26:23.880]  What is it and can it be stopped? We'll talk about that next segment with him
[1:26:23.880 --> 1:26:29.360]  and so much more on the trade deal that Trump's winning. A third of American
[1:26:29.360 --> 1:26:34.520]  companies in China will cancel or delay investments even more are
[1:26:34.520 --> 1:26:38.360]  considering leaving. That's a big article in the Daily Caller with a big
[1:26:38.360 --> 1:26:45.120]  international business survey. Now what's that mean? It means everything was
[1:26:45.120 --> 1:26:48.280]  tilted to where you can only do business in China that no one can compete with
[1:26:48.280 --> 1:26:52.680]  China. But just a year into this trade war that yeah we're gonna have some pain,
[1:26:52.680 --> 1:26:57.760]  that's the cost of being free, at least the cost of at least living on our knees
[1:26:57.760 --> 1:27:01.160]  instead of our bellies. I mean Trump's just trying to get us off our bellies
[1:27:01.160 --> 1:27:07.720]  right now. Gotta learn to crawl first right before we walk. But just that
[1:27:07.720 --> 1:27:13.000]  climate already has it all flooding back to the United States and other
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:17.720]  countries which have better standards of living, which pay people 10-15 times
[1:27:17.720 --> 1:27:22.920]  what a Chinese slave labor is paid. But we have to invest in America, we have to
[1:27:22.920 --> 1:27:29.040]  invest in the West, we have to invest in ourselves. Just like if you invest in
[1:27:29.040 --> 1:27:33.840]  this broadcast and I thank you for doing so. But where are you gonna find an
[1:27:33.840 --> 1:27:38.640]  operation or a company or a news organization that's had this big a
[1:27:38.640 --> 1:27:43.120]  devastating attacks on the globalist? That's why they attack us so people go
[1:27:43.120 --> 1:27:46.880]  oh that's too controversial. We better not repeat what he says because what we're
[1:27:46.880 --> 1:27:51.160]  saying is the truth and it's successful in the fight against them. So we have the
[1:27:51.160 --> 1:27:55.640]  Memorial Day special running with the biggest specials ever on some products

[1:32:58.360 --> 1:33:06.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:10.800 --> 1:33:15.520]  Just into CNN Facebook is purging several high-profile names from its
[1:33:15.520 --> 1:33:19.320]  platforms. Among them right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones as well
[1:33:19.320 --> 1:33:23.720]  as his media outlet info wars. President Trump's furious reaction to
[1:33:23.720 --> 1:33:30.840]  Facebook's action showcases that he is I'm sorry to say that info wars president.
[1:33:30.840 --> 1:33:36.720]  Yes now Facebook is going to banning Alex Jones and info wars from not only
[1:33:36.720 --> 1:33:40.600]  their main platform Facebook but also from Instagram. I want them shut down I
[1:33:40.600 --> 1:33:44.120]  want them silence I want them muted I think they are horrible for our society.
[1:33:44.120 --> 1:33:50.160]  Why is there this unprecedented feeding frenzy happening when it comes to info
[1:33:50.160 --> 1:33:58.160]  wars and yours truly. Why is there this pile on well it's not because Trump is
[1:33:58.160 --> 1:34:05.480]  the info wars presidency. No it's because Trump is trying to execute the
[1:34:05.480 --> 1:34:12.360]  Americana presidency. He's trying to reboot it and yes it's true. Info wars and
[1:34:12.360 --> 1:34:18.720]  my syndicated radio and TV show and our internet reach literally thanks to you
[1:34:18.720 --> 1:34:27.240]  you're 90% of it. You have relaunched a global populist movement and the
[1:34:27.240 --> 1:34:31.640]  establishment thinks that they can destroy me and my name they can
[1:34:31.640 --> 1:34:34.960]  discredit the Liberty movement the populist movement that's not going to
[1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:41.680]  happen but I will be honest with you. Selfishly I would like to continue this
[1:34:41.680 --> 1:34:45.960]  operation and I'd like to continue to keep our crew members employed and I
[1:34:45.960 --> 1:34:50.640]  would like to stay in the fight and keep taking the globalist on and hopefully
[1:34:50.640 --> 1:34:56.640]  contribute meaningfully again in the future. I understand that just to have
[1:34:56.640 --> 1:35:01.600]  the success we've had relaunching Americana and Liberty worldwide once in
[1:35:01.600 --> 1:35:06.480]  a lifetime that was hitting the lottery culturally politically spiritually I'm
[1:35:06.480 --> 1:35:12.120]  very thankful to God I'm not bitching I'm not a victim I'm not a loser I signed
[1:35:12.120 --> 1:35:17.720]  on to this I knew the dangers I just want to stay in the fight it's like
[1:35:17.720 --> 1:35:24.360]  saying to the coach coach please put me into the game and I'll do a great job I
[1:35:24.360 --> 1:35:30.400]  don't want to use a parallel to the greatest player of all time in the NFL
[1:35:30.400 --> 1:35:35.120]  a certain quarterback with the New England Patriots but you know he could
[1:35:35.120 --> 1:35:39.640]  barely get put in in college and even when he finally was put in it and
[1:35:39.640 --> 1:35:45.960]  nothing but win they still weren't sure about it that's football when it comes
[1:35:45.960 --> 1:35:53.400]  to Americana and anti-globalism info wars as an operation is the greatest
[1:35:53.400 --> 1:35:59.360]  player of all time it's not me it's all of us together and the globalists
[1:35:59.360 --> 1:36:06.560]  recognize that and they want to keep us out of the game so please for yourself
[1:36:06.560 --> 1:36:11.960]  for myself for everybody I don't want them to be successful shutting us down
[1:36:11.960 --> 1:36:16.560]  I don't want to be successful having them take us off the air you can stop
[1:36:16.560 --> 1:36:20.720]  their deep platforming with text messages with emails word of mouth it
[1:36:20.720 --> 1:36:25.080]  makes them so angry because they can't silence you the fact that you're
[1:36:25.080 --> 1:36:30.920]  resisting them and winning and they can't stop you supporting the broadcast

[1:37:15.720 --> 1:37:22.240]  segment the next Lord Moncton push for Moncton what's up with that calm the
[1:37:22.240 --> 1:37:26.200]  leading fighter of the whole globalist carbon tax top advisor to Margaret
[1:37:26.200 --> 1:37:31.760]  Thatcher over his whole bio and the the historic moment we're at I predicted
[1:37:31.760 --> 1:37:36.360]  years ago that Briggs it would pass that they would ignore it but that would
[1:37:36.360 --> 1:37:40.240]  cause an even bigger resistance people shouldn't be demoralized well now it's
[1:37:40.240 --> 1:37:43.720]  happened but now the left isn't just throwing milkshakes or throwing bricks
[1:37:43.720 --> 1:37:47.920]  at people they used to beat up or try to beat up Moncton years ago it's gone into
[1:37:47.920 --> 1:37:53.760]  insane overdrive but there was the headline in Reuters yesterday EU elite
[1:37:53.760 --> 1:37:57.600]  worried about populism they warned it's taking over so we've got the Briggs it
[1:37:57.600 --> 1:38:03.680]  movement we've got UKIP we've got all this surging with Nigel Farage and others
[1:38:03.680 --> 1:38:07.680]  and Lord Moncton joins us Lord Moncton thanks for giving us an update on this
[1:38:07.680 --> 1:38:11.320]  amazing fighting against globalism right there in Europe well Alex it's
[1:38:11.320 --> 1:38:15.440]  wonderful to hear you and talking of another come back kid you've come back
[1:38:15.440 --> 1:38:19.840]  fighting not withstanding Google and YouTube trying to shut you up well
[1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:25.280]  Nigel Farage is now another come back kid only five and a half weeks ago he
[1:38:25.280 --> 1:38:29.520]  founded the Brexit Party I was one of the first people to get in touch and say
[1:38:29.520 --> 1:38:33.560]  well done mate and I was with him last night and with my old friend President
[1:38:33.560 --> 1:38:37.720]  Batsalaf Klaus formerly of the Czech Republic and Anne Widdicombe used to
[1:38:37.720 --> 1:38:41.240]  represent my parents constituency in mates and for the Conservative Party she
[1:38:41.240 --> 1:38:46.320]  has now left the Conservative Party joined the Brexit Party as at least 150
[1:38:46.320 --> 1:38:50.480]  thousand other people have done it's growing all the time within weeks it's
[1:38:50.480 --> 1:38:56.120]  now being funded almost exclusively by little donations from ordinary folk who
[1:38:56.120 --> 1:39:01.040]  are fed up to the back teeth with the political establishment desperate to
[1:39:01.040 --> 1:39:08.720]  prevent the ghastly refusal of the they're just refusing to allow us to just
[1:39:08.720 --> 1:39:13.480]  leave the European Union what we all want to do is to leave it say bye bye
[1:39:13.480 --> 1:39:18.640]  we'll trade with them on World Trade Organization terms which means the
[1:39:18.640 --> 1:39:23.120]  tariffs on most goods are not going to be much more than 1% on average and food
[1:39:23.120 --> 1:39:26.360]  and agriculture a bit more but we can adjust those with subsidies to keep
[1:39:26.360 --> 1:39:30.640]  everybody happy and it's perfectly possible to do this the EU doesn't want
[1:39:30.640 --> 1:39:34.520]  to step because they want our taxpayers cash and our taxpayers are fed up with
[1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:38.680]  giving it to them now that rally last night here in London the final rally
[1:39:38.680 --> 1:39:44.720]  before the vote on the EU elections which were having to take part in because
[1:39:44.720 --> 1:39:49.840]  we're still in the EU for the time being it was a triumph first of all and
[1:39:49.840 --> 1:39:53.400]  Widdicombe spoke and she spoke more brilliantly than I've ever heard her
[1:39:53.400 --> 1:39:58.520]  speak before she's come back out of retirement at the age of 70 plus and was
[1:39:58.520 --> 1:40:02.480]  firing on all cylinders then we had Batsalaf Klaus in a moving and very
[1:40:02.480 --> 1:40:06.920]  charming speech saying how much it personally meant to him having lived
[1:40:06.920 --> 1:40:12.920]  in under tyranny of communism in his own country until they broke free and he
[1:40:12.920 --> 1:40:17.280]  became the president of it to see that Britain and Britain virtually alone in
[1:40:17.280 --> 1:40:21.240]  Europe is fighting against the bureaucratic re-establishment of
[1:40:21.240 --> 1:40:26.520]  terror terrorism by the communists left via the European Union so this is a
[1:40:26.520 --> 1:40:30.840]  very great moment for all of us and at the moment the hot news from number 10
[1:40:30.840 --> 1:40:37.520]  which I get from people who are connected there is that Theresa May is not at
[1:40:37.520 --> 1:40:41.480]  the moment taking phone calls it means that some kind of a statement that's
[1:40:41.480 --> 1:40:46.720]  rather urgent is being drafted there have been some suggestions which are not
[1:40:46.720 --> 1:40:50.400]  being confirmed by Downing Street officially that she's on the verge of
[1:40:50.400 --> 1:40:54.400]  resigning well if she is then it's breaking news you heard it here first
[1:40:54.400 --> 1:40:59.640]  and what more it'll be good riddance because she has right from the start
[1:40:59.640 --> 1:41:06.840]  deliberately tried to prevent Brexit and I'm going to come over to the United
[1:41:06.840 --> 1:41:14.640]  States and I'm going to be in Washington DC on the 25th of July this
[1:41:14.640 --> 1:41:22.760]  year at the 13th heartland.org climate conference so if you want to meet me
[1:41:22.760 --> 1:41:28.320]  there and listen to some wonderful talks on this climate nonsense then be there
[1:41:28.320 --> 1:41:33.280]  I will also be briefing congressmen and senators on the progress of... by the way
[1:41:33.280 --> 1:41:36.640]  Lord Mokten I'm gonna come to that event I want to come to that because I'm
[1:41:36.640 --> 1:41:39.840]  going to DC more and more to get briefings of folks and get briefings so
[1:41:39.840 --> 1:41:44.760]  I want to see you again there we'll get to that next segment we'll do it but the
[1:41:44.760 --> 1:41:48.680]  epicness of this I don't think the historicness of this has been has been
[1:41:48.680 --> 1:41:52.400]  clear it's reason I'm interrupting we're about to go to break in six weeks or five
[1:41:52.400 --> 1:41:57.760]  and a half weeks Nigel Farage launches a party that Gallup and others are saying
[1:41:57.760 --> 1:42:02.680]  is set to win 45% of seats in a parliamentary run regardless of that
[1:42:02.680 --> 1:42:06.920]  happens or not I don't think in the history of democratic voting we've
[1:42:06.920 --> 1:42:10.520]  ever seen a party come from nowhere like this I think this signifies the
[1:42:10.520 --> 1:42:15.480]  explosive nature of Europe and the UK wanting independence this is absolutely
[1:42:15.480 --> 1:42:20.040]  right when people use the word populism what they mean is they don't like
[1:42:20.040 --> 1:42:24.400]  democracy so they try to give it a rude name the fact is that what Nigel
[1:42:24.400 --> 1:42:28.080]  Farage said last night it was an electrifying conference there were 4,000
[1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:31.480]  people jammed into a room where you were there only 3,000 seats they were
[1:42:31.480 --> 1:42:34.600]  standing all round they were sitting on the floor they were climbing up the
[1:42:34.600 --> 1:42:38.800]  platform they were absolutely everywhere and the mood was that was nothing
[1:42:38.800 --> 1:42:43.480]  like any political rally I've ever been to in this country people are really fed
[1:42:43.480 --> 1:42:48.160]  up with what happened they're really excited but Nigel Farage has taken stay
[1:42:48.160 --> 1:42:51.200]  right there stay right there but I predicted this two years ago three
[1:42:51.200 --> 1:42:55.080]  years ago I said when they don't let you have Brexit it will be more explosive
[1:42:55.080 --> 1:42:57.760]  it's happening
[1:43:02.760 --> 1:43:07.720]  Tom and Texas police officer on the border talks about MS-13 and more thanks

[1:47:24.400 --> 1:47:29.960]  well they tried to cut the brakes and even unbolt the tires on his car the
[1:47:29.960 --> 1:47:32.880]  French government found that people were trying to kill forage he was a
[1:47:32.880 --> 1:47:38.640]  mysterious plane accident and then he stepped back three years ago instead of
[1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:44.160]  you'll do the Brexit like we said I'll get out of politics well they didn't and
[1:47:44.160 --> 1:47:49.720]  so he came back found the new party six weeks ago and it's set in parliamentary
[1:47:49.720 --> 1:47:55.280]  elections in the whole EU system to win this is so historic this is so big
[1:47:55.280 --> 1:48:00.200]  there's even the New York Times saying how forage's Brexit party is crushing
[1:48:00.200 --> 1:48:04.080]  its opponents and I know there's some fighting between UKIP and forage but the
[1:48:04.080 --> 1:48:07.920]  point is they're all nationalist they're all against the EU and everybody I
[1:48:07.920 --> 1:48:12.720]  talked to in England says oh we're so down that they ignored us and you know we
[1:48:12.720 --> 1:48:16.840]  thought that we had a vote well that only made you matter and I think that is
[1:48:16.840 --> 1:48:22.040]  what we're seeing now so there's the New Yorker the alarming return of Nigel
[1:48:22.040 --> 1:48:28.360]  forage this is just unbelievable and it shows people want out of this
[1:48:28.360 --> 1:48:33.160]  unelected EU meanwhile Dutch asylum minister resigns after hiding number of
[1:48:33.160 --> 1:48:38.000]  refugees committing major crimes this alliance of the left with radical
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:43.600]  Islam Lord Monkton I think is ignited an awakening in the people of Europe and I
[1:48:43.600 --> 1:48:47.000]  don't think there's any pudding with Junie back in the bottle am I wrong and
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:51.360]  how historic is this and as a historian what course do you see this running
[1:48:51.360 --> 1:48:57.880]  regional divide the fundamental divide in politics and this was first
[1:48:57.880 --> 1:49:01.600]  meditated upon thousands of years ago by the philosophers of early imperial
[1:49:01.600 --> 1:49:07.120]  China was between the libertarians that they called them the confusions and the
[1:49:07.120 --> 1:49:11.640]  totalitarians that's the hard left the extremists who want to centralize
[1:49:11.640 --> 1:49:15.560]  everything they call them the legalists that is the fundamental division that has
[1:49:15.560 --> 1:49:21.040]  now come to the fore in British politics because the entire establishment is now
[1:49:21.040 --> 1:49:25.320]  siding with the totalitarian left with the Muslim extremists with the
[1:49:25.320 --> 1:49:29.920]  communists in the in the current Labour Party leadership and against and more
[1:49:29.920 --> 1:49:35.320]  and more openly and visibly against and contemptuous of the ordinary people the
[1:49:35.320 --> 1:49:40.760]  voters the taxpayers who pay for these wretches and what is now happening is
[1:49:40.760 --> 1:49:46.560]  that Nigel Farage has stood up and said if the Conservative Party will no longer
[1:49:46.560 --> 1:49:51.960]  speak for democracy if it will no longer honor the largest vote for any given
[1:49:51.960 --> 1:49:55.640]  thing in the entire history of Britain which was a vote to leave the European
[1:49:55.640 --> 1:50:02.160]  Union if it will stand in the way of democracy and spit on it if the so-called
[1:50:02.160 --> 1:50:05.640]  elected Parliament the mother of Parliament is now the mother of
[1:50:05.640 --> 1:50:10.400]  totalitarianism then we are going to change it we're going to throw out the
[1:50:10.400 --> 1:50:14.440]  people who are there now and put in people who believe in democracy and what
[1:50:14.440 --> 1:50:18.840]  is interesting about meeting I met quite a lot of the candidates for the Brexit
[1:50:18.840 --> 1:50:23.280]  Party last night at Nigel Farage's reception just before the great rally
[1:50:23.280 --> 1:50:28.360]  here at Kensington Olympia in London and these are people of a quality and a
[1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:33.760]  standard that is a great deal higher than the average that we now have among the
[1:50:33.760 --> 1:50:40.040]  grey totalitarians on all sides in Parliament so a revolution is coming and
[1:50:40.040 --> 1:50:44.480]  it's a revolution that will not be done by violence of the left to it but by
[1:50:44.480 --> 1:50:49.400]  the ballot box as those who believe in democracy do it so yet if they want to
[1:50:49.400 --> 1:50:52.760]  call us populists they can call us populists what we call ourselves is
[1:50:52.760 --> 1:50:57.680]  people who believe in the people and the right of the people to decide by their
[1:50:57.680 --> 1:51:01.600]  vote in a ballot box what happens to their country and Lord Moncton Lord Moncton
[1:51:01.600 --> 1:51:05.760]  by the way they act like it's a dirty word to say populist populist means the
[1:51:05.760 --> 1:51:10.320]  people so what's wrong with the movement of the people well there's absolutely
[1:51:10.320 --> 1:51:14.080]  nothing wrong with it at all except that if you're a totalitarian the one thing
[1:51:14.080 --> 1:51:18.320]  you fear is the people because you want to lord it over them you want to rule
[1:51:18.320 --> 1:51:22.200]  them and that's why and this is another event I want to just talk about briefly
[1:51:22.200 --> 1:51:27.320]  I am coming to the United States and on July the 28th to August the 3rd in the
[1:51:27.320 --> 1:51:31.600]  Berkshire mountains at Pittsfield Massachusetts there will be a Christian
[1:51:31.600 --> 1:51:36.400]  summer camp for kids aged 10 to 20 and their parents and anybody else who wants
[1:51:36.400 --> 1:51:41.880]  to come and I will be speaking there about the European question and about
[1:51:41.880 --> 1:51:47.320]  the differences between the European tyranny by clock and it's essentially
[1:51:47.320 --> 1:51:52.080]  Soviet Constitution on the one hand and the American Constitution which is a
[1:51:52.080 --> 1:51:56.600]  Constitution for democracy and liberty and of course populism on the other and
[1:51:56.600 --> 1:52:00.520]  so that will be something which if you and your kids want to come you go on to
[1:52:00.520 --> 1:52:06.840]  campconstitution.net campconstitution.net and make sure you book in at Alex I
[1:52:06.840 --> 1:52:11.720]  want to see you there too and then we'll go from the Heartland Conference to the
[1:52:11.720 --> 1:52:15.040]  Camp Constitution Conference and you can do both of them you will find a lot of
[1:52:15.040 --> 1:52:19.080]  friends and supporters in both places let me ask you this Lord Moncton you
[1:52:19.080 --> 1:52:23.120]  were on my show I think the first time ten years ago you predicted the break
[1:52:23.120 --> 1:52:26.800]  up of the EU you predicted the carbon tax would fail but you predicted they
[1:52:26.800 --> 1:52:30.160]  would strike back with violence you let it all out we've got to find those old
[1:52:30.160 --> 1:52:34.120]  interviews they deleted off YouTube you you you're a you're a futurist not just
[1:52:34.120 --> 1:52:39.060]  an inventor and a scientist so give us your long term short term but also mid
[1:52:39.060 --> 1:52:44.720]  term long term forecast just briefly a just stalt of what you think's coming
[1:52:44.720 --> 1:52:50.120]  as you've been prescient in your predictions. Right well I've just come back from Berlin
[1:52:50.120 --> 1:52:55.280]  where I addressed the German parliament on the nonsense that is global warming
[1:52:55.280 --> 1:53:01.080]  and found a very surprisingly friendly reception I think they are heartily fed
[1:53:01.080 --> 1:53:05.120]  up with the communists having driven them all the red piece as they call green
[1:53:05.120 --> 1:53:10.440]  peace having driven them into this energy thing that they do and tens of
[1:53:10.440 --> 1:53:14.880]  billions of fines on Volkswagen and Audi and all of it. All of that sort of
[1:53:14.880 --> 1:53:18.480]  thing and all the manufacturers have been fiddling their computers so as to
[1:53:18.480 --> 1:53:22.200]  pass the emissions test and the only one that got caught was Volkswagen but I
[1:53:22.200 --> 1:53:26.280]  used to ride motorbikes from Italy years ago and they were doing they've been
[1:53:26.280 --> 1:53:30.480]  doing it for decades because everybody is heartily fed up with all this global
[1:53:30.480 --> 1:53:34.840]  warming rubbish the world will warm at a rate of about one Celsius this century
[1:53:34.840 --> 1:53:38.160]  half a Celsius next century and that'll be at the fossil fuels that are run out
[1:53:38.160 --> 1:53:42.080]  by then so all of this nonsense is completely unnecessary but again it's
[1:53:42.080 --> 1:53:45.960]  the totalitarians they simply want to show who's boss and you mentioned quite
[1:53:45.960 --> 1:53:51.240]  rightly the way that they tend to side with other totalitarians so you now have
[1:53:51.240 --> 1:53:56.880]  a communist left getting together with the Islamic left because they're all
[1:53:56.880 --> 1:54:01.600]  totalitarians they all don't believe in democracy they all hate democracy they
[1:54:01.600 --> 1:54:07.080]  hate the people and so now they're banding together increasingly and our
[1:54:07.080 --> 1:54:11.080]  Labour Party here in the country is getting millions of pounds from Arab
[1:54:11.080 --> 1:54:17.040]  interests and it's illegal donations I may say and that is why Jeremy Corbyn
[1:54:17.040 --> 1:54:20.520]  won't come out and stop the anti-Semitism in his party because every
[1:54:20.520 --> 1:54:23.880]  time he's accused of anti-Semitism another fat check arrives from the Arab
[1:54:23.880 --> 1:54:28.240]  world so this is a very dangerous moment where we're getting increasing
[1:54:28.240 --> 1:54:33.000]  interference in our policy in our politics from totalitarian forces
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:37.520]  outside our countries and we have to be vigilant and we have to make sure that
[1:54:37.520 --> 1:54:43.200]  our security services are vigilant in identifying the flows of money into the
[1:54:43.200 --> 1:54:48.080]  political parties from undesirable totalitarian elements overseas whether
[1:54:48.080 --> 1:54:52.040]  it be communist China whether it be Huawei messing around to get contracts
[1:54:52.040 --> 1:54:56.960]  that was my next point that was about prescient will you see with Trump the
[1:54:56.960 --> 1:55:02.440]  instinct to fight China and in fact they've had a just a naked hand a free
[1:55:02.440 --> 1:55:05.960]  hand the fact that you see all these ministers having to resign covering up
[1:55:05.960 --> 1:55:10.760]  Islamic terror and criminal activity it seems that Europe is really beginning
[1:55:10.760 --> 1:55:15.360]  to wake up not just in the population but in governments itself that the real
[1:55:15.360 --> 1:55:20.240]  revolution may be happening there and a very interesting problem arises because
[1:55:20.240 --> 1:55:26.520]  how do we make sure that we face this hatred which the left directs at the
[1:55:26.520 --> 1:55:30.040]  peoples of the free world and that the Muslims direct at the people of the free
[1:55:30.040 --> 1:55:35.080]  world how do we face this hatred with love because we are Christians it's not
[1:55:35.080 --> 1:55:40.240]  for us to fight back using violence we've got to fight back using the weapons
[1:55:40.240 --> 1:55:45.840]  the Lord of life gave us which is simply to be unrelenting unrelentingly loving
[1:55:45.840 --> 1:55:50.920]  unrelentingly unrelentingly kind to them but not let our guard down and this is
[1:55:50.920 --> 1:55:55.880]  the big problem that in the West we have become lazy we thought right
[1:55:55.880 --> 1:55:59.840]  communism has gone we can also have a sigh of relief not realizing that
[1:55:59.840 --> 1:56:04.680]  communism was was working away underneath they took over the universities
[1:56:04.680 --> 1:56:08.080]  they took over the teacher training colleges that's how they managed to
[1:56:08.080 --> 1:56:11.600]  radicalize all the primary even the primary schools that are now taught
[1:56:11.600 --> 1:56:15.800]  communism and they're not taught how many people communism killed so when they
[1:56:15.800 --> 1:56:19.440]  get to university they're already radicalized they're already hard left
[1:56:19.440 --> 1:56:24.080]  and although younger people are always a bit more to the left than older people
[1:56:24.080 --> 1:56:28.920]  the fact is that now in the universities in Britain as in the United States there
[1:56:28.920 --> 1:56:34.240]  is a kind of hatred and extremism on the left which is viciously intolerant of
[1:56:34.240 --> 1:56:38.080]  any alternative point of view and just as you have been pushed off YouTube and
[1:56:38.080 --> 1:56:41.840]  pushed off Google and pushed off yahoo and pushed off all the places where you
[1:56:41.840 --> 1:56:47.200]  used to be able to reach so if you try to go to a university now and speak
[1:56:47.200 --> 1:56:52.200]  anything other than the latest left-wing party line the latest communist party
[1:56:52.200 --> 1:56:56.200]  line whether on climate or homosexuality or all Europe it doesn't matter what the
[1:56:56.200 --> 1:57:00.800]  subject is they will say because they know they would lose if they had to
[1:57:00.800 --> 1:57:04.640]  debate you they just say we won't debate you we won't even let you come they call
[1:57:04.640 --> 1:57:09.160]  it no platforming and this is increasingly how the hard left operate
[1:57:09.160 --> 1:57:12.640]  and what we're going to have to do what we are ready planning to do at the
[1:57:12.640 --> 1:57:19.360]  Brexit Party is to introduce a freedom law which will once again restore the
[1:57:19.360 --> 1:57:24.960]  right of freedom of speech which to stay there we were in five minutes we
[1:57:24.960 --> 1:57:28.700]  gotta break five more minutes on the other side solutions of Lord Moncton when
[1:57:28.700 --> 1:57:31.880]  we take the government's back what we're going to do like he's he's already
[1:57:31.880 --> 1:57:35.360]  alluding to it we're not gonna act like them we're not gonna ban their speech
[1:57:35.360 --> 1:57:40.040]  we're just gonna legalize speech again the problem is they are going to launch
[1:57:40.040 --> 1:57:44.960]  terror attacks so I agree no offensive violence but defense we must have stay
[1:57:44.960 --> 1:57:51.200]  with us everybody knows that supplements are amazing that what God gave us your
[1:57:51.200 --> 1:57:54.520]  mother nature is incredible that's why supplements are the biggest growing
[1:57:54.520 --> 1:57:58.960]  industry in the world and the globalists are so upset the problem is people
[1:57:58.960 --> 1:58:04.480]  forget to take them and that's why the whole industry has moved towards packets

[1:58:56.640 --> 1:59:01.040]  alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and
[1:59:01.040 --> 1:59:06.640]  sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s
[1:59:06.640 --> 1:59:10.600]  researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[1:59:10.600 --> 1:59:15.280]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began
[1:59:15.280 --> 1:59:19.800]  studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[1:59:19.800 --> 1:59:24.480]  of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal
[1:59:24.480 --> 1:59:29.040]  distress symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an
[1:59:29.040 --> 1:59:33.120]  antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by
[1:59:33.120 --> 1:59:37.600]  blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and
[1:59:37.600 --> 1:59:42.200]  inflammatory responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe

[1:59:50.280 --> 1:59:55.760]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:59:55.760 --> 2:00:14.120]  six weeks ago the Brexit party was founded by Nigel Farage that helped found
[2:00:14.120 --> 2:00:20.800]  UKIP and it's surged to set to win the most seats in the new parliament that is
[2:00:20.800 --> 2:00:24.960]  scaring the hell out of the globalist Lord Monk to help found UKIP has been
[2:00:24.960 --> 2:00:29.040]  involved with Brexit and promoting it was getting into the fact that left is
[2:00:29.040 --> 2:00:35.200]  going to launch violent attacks as they lose and at a certain point though when
[2:00:35.200 --> 2:00:37.880]  governments are controlled and you see the British government and others
[2:00:37.880 --> 2:00:43.240]  actually aiding Islamist attacking people out trying to campaign it you know
[2:00:43.240 --> 2:00:47.040]  it is really frightening so in the four or five minutes we have left a what do
[2:00:47.040 --> 2:00:51.480]  you predict with the violence by the left how is that dealt with and then B
[2:00:51.480 --> 2:00:58.760]  what is the parliamentary and legislative moves by President Trump by the UK by
[2:00:58.760 --> 2:01:02.080]  the new prime minister that obviously is going to be coming in I mean we need to
[2:01:02.080 --> 2:01:08.960]  defend the sacred sanct pillars of our republics well the first step we've got
[2:01:08.960 --> 2:01:13.920]  to do is once we get rid of Theresa May and that could even happen tonight as
[2:01:13.920 --> 2:01:18.560]  I've said though there are hot denials coming from Downing Street at the moment
[2:01:18.560 --> 2:01:24.360]  once we've got rid of her because she was simply too willing to cave in to the
[2:01:24.360 --> 2:01:27.800]  European Union and leave us in the European Union when we'd voted to get
[2:01:27.800 --> 2:01:33.240]  out so once she's gone we will then hope to get a prime minister if the Tory
[2:01:33.240 --> 2:01:38.160]  party has any sense at all who is actually willing to carry out the will
[2:01:38.160 --> 2:01:42.680]  of the people regardless of what the EU wants and we will leave we'll leave on
[2:01:42.680 --> 2:01:48.080]  World Trade Organization terms once we have freed ourselves of that then our
[2:01:48.080 --> 2:01:52.280]  prime minister and your president are going to be working together very
[2:01:52.280 --> 2:01:58.720]  closely on dealing with the new threat of totalitarianism that comes from the
[2:01:58.720 --> 2:02:04.440]  totalitarian left we had it with fascism in Germany which of course was not an
[2:02:04.440 --> 2:02:08.120]  extreme right movement it was extreme left movement the National Socialist
[2:02:08.120 --> 2:02:12.800]  Workers Party of Germany we had fascism which was an extreme left movement in
[2:02:12.800 --> 2:02:17.600]  Italy now branded by the left as right but of course they were of the left and
[2:02:17.600 --> 2:02:22.960]  then there was communism in Russia the steelys communism in China and that's of
[2:02:22.960 --> 2:02:28.240]  the far totalitarian left and now the totalitarian left are gradually trying
[2:02:28.240 --> 2:02:31.880]  to take over our institutions and they're trying to shut down the west by
[2:02:31.880 --> 2:02:35.600]  using this climate change nonsense and as an excuse and they're having
[2:02:35.600 --> 2:02:41.200]  substantial success the last British steel company of any size British steel
[2:02:41.200 --> 2:02:45.320]  itself which was nationalized and now belongs to an Indian steel company is
[2:02:45.320 --> 2:02:49.000]  about to be closed down and his business transferred to India where they can make
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:52.680]  steel at half the price price because they don't have to pay three times the
[2:02:52.680 --> 2:02:57.480]  world price for their electricity because global warming so gradually we are
[2:02:57.480 --> 2:03:03.240]  going to have to fight back against this totalitarian sort of day March where
[2:03:03.240 --> 2:03:07.560]  the left are advancing on every front and through every backdoor wherever you
[2:03:07.560 --> 2:03:11.480]  look they're getting in there they're shutting down debate and if they can't
[2:03:11.480 --> 2:03:15.800]  shut down debate they'll turn to violence well increasingly what we are going to
[2:03:15.800 --> 2:03:19.880]  do about that is to make sure that the existing laws we have plenty of laws to
[2:03:19.880 --> 2:03:24.080]  prevent violence in the streets we are going to make sure that those laws are
[2:03:24.080 --> 2:03:27.240]  enforced you don't need to make new laws you just need to make sure the
[2:03:27.240 --> 2:03:32.880]  existing laws are enforced and that the penalties for violence or for attempted
[2:03:32.880 --> 2:03:36.880]  suppression of free speech will be very severe and one of the things that we are
[2:03:36.880 --> 2:03:41.920]  looking at in the Brexit Party is a comprehensive law which will encompass
[2:03:41.920 --> 2:03:45.000]  some of the finer elements of your Constitution which is a very fine
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:50.600]  Constitution notably the amendment that gave you the right of free speech but
[2:03:50.600 --> 2:03:55.080]  if even with the right of free speech that you have in America there is still
[2:03:55.080 --> 2:03:59.280]  the silencing of free speech by no platforming and by violence in the
[2:03:59.280 --> 2:04:05.320]  lecture halls in cartels cartels exactly well what we are going to do is to pass
[2:04:05.320 --> 2:04:13.320]  very stiff laws so that if universities permit the far left to behave in this way
[2:04:13.320 --> 2:04:18.400]  they will lose a substantial proportion of their funding which largely comes from
[2:04:18.400 --> 2:04:22.760]  taxpayers in this country and so they'll they'll feel it in their pocket
[2:04:22.760 --> 2:04:28.000]  unless they stand up and make sure that there is free speech and freedom of
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:31.560]  academic I agree Lord Martin it's been too long in the aftermath of the
[2:04:31.560 --> 2:04:36.000]  elections please join us next week or so or even tomorrow in the aftermath thank

[2:04:40.080 --> 2:04:43.480]  time to be alive I would say though humanity and freedoms on the March I
[2:04:43.480 --> 2:04:47.240]  think corruption is on its heels we've got to press the attack in five seconds
[2:04:47.240 --> 2:04:50.800]  is that accurate yes it is campedconstitution.net
[2:04:50.800 --> 2:04:54.200]  heartland.org campedconstitution.net
[2:04:54.200 --> 2:05:24.040]  all right thank you I got mob on the streets by fans but almost all of them said we used to love you on air it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube are you coming back we're at infowars.com we're at newswars.com Paul Watson's launched his own summit.news we have our own videos we have our own articles they're trying to destroy us but thanks to you and others having us on infowars we're still chatting along
[2:05:24.040 --> 2:05:41.040]  so we're there folks tomorrow's news today I'm at infowars.com and newswars.com we knew this
[2:05:41.040 --> 2:05:45.160]  censorship is coming forever we have our own video streams our own audio streams and
[2:05:45.160 --> 2:05:48.920]  it's all free to air anybody can use it we upload and do whatever you want people
[2:05:48.920 --> 2:05:51.880]  go to infowars.com and newswars.com that's where they find it
[2:05:51.880 --> 2:05:56.880]  you know there's what things called websites things go there
[2:05:56.880 --> 2:06:16.880]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones
[2:06:16.880 --> 2:06:32.880]  the global controllers are very smart in some ways very ignorant in others but they understand the power of art types and I never knew when I started out on my quest 25 years ago to restore the American Republic that I would end up being a major leader in it
[2:06:32.880 --> 2:06:39.880]  I just thought I'd be one more voice calling on the people to stand up and get involved in their own destinies
[2:06:39.880 --> 2:06:52.880]  but it became clear eight nine years ago even in Newsweek and Time Magazine they said Alex Jones is the mad prophet of the Tea Party in the wilderness he must be stopped
[2:06:52.880 --> 2:07:19.880]  and all these years later I realized that I didn't invent the ideas I'm promoting I'm simply promoting free market Renaissance Americana and ideas that are diametrically opposed to authoritarian systems whether they be fascist communist or socialist
[2:07:19.880 --> 2:07:34.880]  but nevertheless info wars has been chosen by the enemy as the symbol of Americana as the card and if they can demonize it if they can lie about it and if they can destroy it
[2:07:34.880 --> 2:07:45.880]  they believe they can demoralize you and make you give up so please hold info wars up please promote it please support it
[2:07:45.880 --> 2:08:02.880]  I personally hope that we can survive this but even if we don't don't think a defeat of an individual organization is an expression of who you are because you are the listeners and viewers that actually made info wars the success it is
[2:08:02.880 --> 2:08:15.880]  I selfishly want to continue on with the future but I don't want you to ever think that if I'm set up, killed, destroyed, imprisoned, lied about with their fake narratives that we're losers
[2:08:15.880 --> 2:08:21.880]  we did the right thing and told the truth and we've already changed the world so you need to continue on
[2:08:21.880 --> 2:08:32.880]  but we're at that fork in the road will info wars continue on to fight more battles and when more battles takes your support or will be destroyed and then you have to move on and not be demoralized
[2:08:32.880 --> 2:08:50.880]  we're at that point it's financial in the end of the day money talks BS walks funding allows us to operate and expand and defeat the enemy not having money shuts us down and we're defeated and once we've been silenced the enemy can lie about us all day long
[2:08:50.880 --> 2:09:02.880]  we're running Memorial Day specials right through next week some of the biggest cells we've ever done 60% off extended wise for cardiovascular and heart it's the best formula out there

[2:09:53.880 --> 2:10:13.880]  and for all of our own destiny because this is an incredible time and humanity at that fork in the road or at that crossroads but whatever you do never give into the globalist never give in your humanity never believe you're a piece of crap never believe the humanity sucks because that is a lie of the old serpent Satan
[2:10:13.880 --> 2:10:35.880]  my head is spinning right now Millie Weaver this year amazing info wars reporter I was going to air in the last second this hour I've said in a half minute interview that they just spontaneously did with their beautiful baby her and her husband here
[2:10:35.880 --> 2:10:55.880]  yesterday but in time we may not have time to get that done because they went out to a pro kill baby event including kill babies after their born event and they had people out there saying we're going to kill babies till age three which is the official position of Peter Singer
[2:10:55.880 --> 2:11:13.880]  and of the left and so it's just crazy now to see that his level of anti human exterminism is now right now in the locals we're going to play those clips as well so much here today but first off just during the break we've got Fox News CNN MSNBC we've got them all on all over the building
[2:11:13.880 --> 2:11:29.880]  and I saw Pelosi who said Trump's covering up right now no they're covering up Russia gate their own China gate and their own server gate their own open borders gate their own hate America gate but like Trump said yesterday something's wrong with Fox News
[2:11:29.880 --> 2:11:51.880]  they have these stage town halls and nothing but standing ovations bashing Trump that you know are rigged where every person hates Trump they have events where they're acting like he's a criminal they're having these events where they go oh let's go to Pelosi oh she prays for the president she cares about the president you know she just wants him to let her into all of his life
[2:11:51.880 --> 2:12:07.880]  why is it Trump going on the offense with all the crimes they've committed Barr has said they are but that's my point is you've got to go on the offense because these criminals know they've been caught they're not going to stop so here is just a few minutes ago with a
[2:12:07.880 --> 2:12:21.880]  perino girl from perino chow she's up there she's up there putting all this out and then we're going to go to what Pelosi said earlier today and then what Trump responded to here it is
[2:12:21.880 --> 2:12:45.880]  it wasn't really respectful of the reason of the Congress and the White House working together he just took a pass and it just makes me wonder why why he did that in any event I pray for the president of the United States and I pray for the United States of America
[2:12:45.880 --> 2:12:57.880]  that's a little dramatic in terms of what happened this morning but she up until I think today has really been the one that's reluctant to talk about impeachment she actually had the conference call today saying look at all these things
[2:12:57.880 --> 2:13:15.880]  the Democrats are trying to act like they're being reasonable about impeachment when it's what they want they want to unseat the 2016 election they got caught in the fake Russia gate and now they turn it around with dozens of fake investigations and say because he won't give over all his private info so they can lie about it twist it
[2:13:15.880 --> 2:13:32.880]  attack everybody he's in business with when nothing they do Hillary's bashing up hard drives bleach bidding you know but there's no investigations of that it's all imaginary investigations and her saying impeachment and she prays for him because he's in so much trouble
[2:13:32.880 --> 2:13:49.880]  and though they're desperate globalism is failing from Brazil to Europe to Asia to Africa to here and they're crapping their dirty pants we're going to Millie Weaver next segment but let's let's let's let's go to her this morning with the talk of impeachment and Trump's covering something up
[2:13:49.880 --> 2:14:06.880]  we do believe that it's important for the to follow the facts we believe that no one is above the law including the president of the United States and we believe that the president of the United States is engaged in a cover up in a cover up and that makes the nation
[2:14:06.880 --> 2:14:21.880]  America was never great it'll never be great Trump sucks Russians got him elected all that proved me a fraud no investigations of their criminal activity and Trump just sits there waiting for him to come for everybody while they already censor everybody and I get it
[2:14:21.880 --> 2:14:36.880]  he keeps working with the Justice Department who keeps saying they're going to do something but they're not so we the people have to march on Washington we have to call Congress we have to sue all these people ourselves I'm serious folks we have to fight because you think things aren't perfect under Trump wait till they were moving here's
[2:14:36.880 --> 2:14:55.880]  Trump's response to this so I came here to do a meeting on infrastructure with Democrats not really thinking they wanted to do infrastructure or anything else other than investigate and I just saw that Nancy Pelosi just before our meeting made a statement that we believe that the
[2:14:55.880 --> 2:15:12.880]  president of the United States is engaged in a cover up well it turns out I'm the most proud and I think most of you would agree to this I'm the most transparent president probably in the history of this country we have given
[2:15:12.880 --> 2:15:28.880]  on a witch hunt on a hoax the whole thing with Russia was a hoax we're gonna play more of this after the break but I want to explain something I told the president and others did sir declare executive privilege everybody else he gave them everything
[2:15:28.880 --> 2:15:42.880]  he had nothing to hide and now they said fine give us a 50 years of your tax returns give us your blood type give us what toilet paper used to wipe your ass and while they're committing all these crimes and it's just insane to watch this happen we go in the
[2:15:42.880 --> 2:15:54.880]  office or they destroy the country the globalists know that we're on our last legs they get rid of Trump info wars dot com tomorrow's news today million we were with us

[2:20:39.880 --> 2:20:49.880]  all right folks we're gonna cover this next segment as it ties into the anti-human agenda CBS saying don't take care of kids work at your job
[2:20:49.880 --> 2:20:58.880]  the left saying don't have families that gets in the way of our world government this just broke on info wars.com and news wars.com and only you can
[2:20:58.880 --> 2:21:13.880]  Facebook it tweet it email it text message to get it out there target sells LGBTQ clothing for children funds group whose founder praise the North American man boy love association
[2:21:13.880 --> 2:21:28.880]  and it says hashtag take pride folks it's like cartoons now that show gay characters kids aren't into sex they're not it's sexualization children it's pure evil and it's admittedly going on and it's got to stop
[2:21:28.880 --> 2:21:44.880]  stories up on news wars.com please for the children get it out millie we're making points about trump and one which ends and as we said they promised to fire a bunch of others trumps got them all dead to right but he's got a political justice department
[2:21:44.880 --> 2:22:00.880]  that's been involved in all sorts of illegal activity at the highest levels the average rank and file I'm not just saying and I've researched that are pretty good people on average but at the top it's a political corrupt mafia and I don't know what Trump or what we're supposed to do but this is serious
[2:22:00.880 --> 2:22:16.880]  well what would be the point of impeaching a president right before campaign season we already know that his time is coming up unless he gets reelected well that's what it is the democrats are panicking because they know they don't have a solid candidate to go up against
[2:22:16.880 --> 2:22:26.880]  Trump when he's pulling great and everyone is supporting him and he's been improving the economy and Pelosi knows that but her constituents and her party are demanding.
[2:22:26.880 --> 2:22:38.880]  Exactly and for example Joe Biden when he just had his campaign release his first rally in Pittsburgh I went there and covered it he barely could fill a 240 occupancy building.
[2:22:38.880 --> 2:22:50.880]  Alex and his overflow was like 1520 people they are panicking because in that same city trump has held rallies there and I've been to them and it's miles long miles long of people standing in line.
[2:22:50.880 --> 2:23:05.880]  You live in Ohio you're covered every week. Oh yeah I cover the whole campaign. So let's be clear let's be clear they have way less energy than 2016 their censorship backfiring they're not giving up though they're getting violent they're getting aggressive they're out of control.
[2:23:05.880 --> 2:23:18.880]  They want to disqualify him so that he can't run. Let me just tell you I just had the top court in Canada send us a letter they're suing us because I'm criticizing them taking kids from their parents and forced drugging him.
[2:23:18.880 --> 2:23:29.880]  That's global government. I have to do all that when the show goes off today that they want to silence everybody and if you don't want to take kids and drug them or cut their balls off you're going to be sued by the Canadian government.
[2:23:29.880 --> 2:23:40.880]  And if you think it's bad now it's really going to be bad if we were actually by some chance going to get a Democrat in 2020 it's going to be bad we're not going to have free speech anymore.
[2:23:40.880 --> 2:23:51.880]  Remember back when we were like oh it's almost like autism is targeting boys 85% are boys or oh they're trying to put all the kids other boys on on on Ritalin that brain damages them it's like they're targeting them.
[2:23:51.880 --> 2:24:02.880]  They now say we're targeting boys we're targeting families we're targeting women humans are bad we're going to kill everybody it's like my God why aren't more people more pissed.
[2:24:02.880 --> 2:24:11.880]  Exactly the left is outright admitting that they hate white males we hear them saying this all the time so why wouldn't they just admit they're targeting males.
[2:24:11.880 --> 2:24:20.880]  They have major breweries saying if you see a Trump supporter or a conservative hit him in the head with a brick and kill him and then people say you're asking for trouble they freak out and call the police.
[2:24:20.880 --> 2:24:33.880]  There's no reality or or or there's a paradox where they attack we defend they call that violence standing up to a leftist swing a bike lock is now terrorism.
[2:24:33.880 --> 2:24:47.880]  Asking questions to a leftist is now terrorism that's what the ladies out at this stop the abortion ban protest were saying to me and Caitlin how dare we question women how dare we question their stances when they want to kill babies.
[2:24:47.880 --> 2:24:50.880]  They think that that was hateful and harassing.
[2:24:50.880 --> 2:24:59.880]  They say they want to kill babies I have them on video and then they make joke videos about that when we come back we're going to play your report this incredible and the other amazing report by Caitlin Bennett.
[2:24:59.880 --> 2:25:14.880]  And then I even see how they attacked Caitlin you with these fake memes these fake lies these fake stories these fake legends but you ladies just laugh at it keep moving forward and that's what pisses them off because you have a word called integrity and soul and
[2:25:14.880 --> 2:25:19.880]  a compass and you know who you are you know what you stand for you know the truth.
[2:25:19.880 --> 2:25:29.880]  Exactly you know they're trying to attack any conservative now that simply goes out and shows that the left is deranged and crazy.
[2:25:29.880 --> 2:25:36.880]  They even attack Candice Owens and she some would say she's kind of milk toast you know so they're going to continue to censor us.
[2:25:36.880 --> 2:25:50.880]  It doesn't stop at Alex Jones and Info Wars it's only going to get worse and that's why it's good that the president just recently had released a form on the White House Web site where anyone who has been can report the censorship.
[2:25:50.880 --> 2:25:51.880]  Exactly and that's important.
[2:25:51.880 --> 2:25:52.880]  They're building a dossier.
[2:25:52.880 --> 2:26:03.880]  They need evidence to be able to hold social media accountable and let me go further than that because this is something I haven't said because I didn't want to to horns but I think three weeks after.
[2:26:03.880 --> 2:26:11.880]  Tomorrow three weeks tomorrow Trump tweeting you and tweeting our links and tweeting Paul Watson and saying how proud he is of Info Wars.
[2:26:11.880 --> 2:26:15.880]  That was Trump in a major alignment saying I've been aligned I am aligned.
[2:26:15.880 --> 2:26:21.880]  All your attacks on Info Wars aren't going to make me forsake it but he gets we're not going to forsake him unless he forsakes the message.
[2:26:21.880 --> 2:26:22.880]  But that's what pisses them off.
[2:26:22.880 --> 2:26:29.880]  They want to define what's acceptable and they want to then redefine what wasn't acceptable as acceptable.
[2:26:29.880 --> 2:26:38.880]  Exactly and what Trump essentially did was he showed he's not willing to sell out to any establishment whether it be the Democrats or some of the old rhino neocons.
[2:26:38.880 --> 2:26:46.880]  He's loyal to the grassroots because he knows the grassroots are the blue collar Americans the people who are stupid plan.
[2:26:46.880 --> 2:26:58.880]  They thought they could attack me in the name of Trump and that would get me to drop Trump or they could attack Trump and my name he would drop me and that's not how this works and they cannot believe that they can't.
[2:26:58.880 --> 2:27:04.880]  And I even told Trump I said you know last time I talked to him I said listen for whatever reason you're smarter than I am anyways.
[2:27:04.880 --> 2:27:10.880]  And you know in your age I said if you need to throw me under the bus I've said some things out of context are going do it.
[2:27:10.880 --> 2:27:20.880]  And I'm not going to attack you for that as long as you stay true to the agenda of Americana and freedom and pro-life and God and country and the military and and our free and our borders.
[2:27:20.880 --> 2:27:24.880]  I'm going to support it and Trump said very interesting I'll keep that in mind that's not going to be needed.
[2:27:24.880 --> 2:27:29.880]  And I said well then fine don't call me anymore I don't need you to pat me on the head you know if you need people get in contact with me do it.
[2:27:29.880 --> 2:27:36.880]  And now I have you know I'm going to get into it obviously but you know I mean it's not anything fancy or big we're creating the trends here.
[2:27:36.880 --> 2:27:41.880]  U.S. intelligence is loyal to the country listens to me I listen to them too but it's mainly 90% the other way.
[2:27:41.880 --> 2:27:43.880]  And so now they can't stand it.
[2:27:43.880 --> 2:27:49.880]  I write reports given to U.S. intelligence goes right to the president and I've got law firms doing it and that's how it works and they can't stand it.
[2:27:49.880 --> 2:27:55.880]  They can take me off air my report still go right to the president and they cannot stand it Millie they cannot stand it.
[2:27:55.880 --> 2:27:59.880]  I said sir no need to talk to me over the telephone just get your people in touch with me I'll get your reports.
[2:27:59.880 --> 2:28:03.880]  He said that's a good plan Mr. Jones really appreciate that and just keep it up.
[2:28:03.880 --> 2:28:07.880]  Boom we're done we're Americans this isn't about me getting a job in D.C.
[2:28:07.880 --> 2:28:13.880]  It's not about getting patted on the head it's about them not aborting babies and killing babies after they're born and teaching five year olds how to suck cock.
[2:28:13.880 --> 2:28:20.880]  Exactly and not doing away with the First Amendment the Second Amendment the Constitution that protects the American people.
[2:28:20.880 --> 2:28:22.880]  That's what the Democrats want to get rid of.
[2:28:22.880 --> 2:28:29.880]  This is war you want it you got it they keep shilling me they keep threatening me they keep lying about me they keep attacking me I want them to get through their head.

[2:31:04.880 --> 2:31:09.880]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products. I got to do a shout out for the bone broth.
[2:31:09.880 --> 2:31:14.880]  The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth.
[2:31:14.880 --> 2:31:19.880]  Tastes like, tastes like great milkshake. You know, if you just add it to milk.
[2:31:19.880 --> 2:31:25.880]  It tastes like oval theme. It tastes like oval theme. It tastes like oval theme. Like good.
[2:31:25.880 --> 2:31:31.880]  I feel great since I've been taking it. My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride-free toothpaste.
[2:31:31.880 --> 2:31:37.880]  I'd use the SuperMail Vitality, a host of other products. So thank you so much for that as well.
[2:31:37.880 --> 2:31:40.880]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air. I'm thanking you.

[2:31:52.880 --> 2:32:13.880]  My Leaps and My Bounds. The number one best selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[2:32:13.880 --> 2:32:23.880]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[2:32:46.880 --> 2:32:52.880]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[2:32:52.880 --> 2:33:18.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:18.880 --> 2:33:43.880]  All right, Millie Weaver's here with us. Describe yesterday because you already put some clips of this up on your Twitter.
[2:33:43.880 --> 2:33:53.880]  But this is pro-abortion, pro-leftist going crazy in downtown Austin, outside the Capitol, pushing this pro-death culture.
[2:33:53.880 --> 2:34:01.880]  And then we have, from the same rally, another clip we're going to play of the true face of evil, leftist calling for killing babies up to age three.
[2:34:01.880 --> 2:34:03.880]  Tell us what we're about to see.
[2:34:03.880 --> 2:34:13.880]  Well, you know, Caitlin, Bennett and I, we went out to this stop the abortion bans protest in Austin and the left has just lost their mind.
[2:34:13.880 --> 2:34:17.880]  They have so many contradictions and ironies. It was ridiculous.
[2:34:17.880 --> 2:34:25.880]  They had a man up there that they were applauding and cheering who had a big sign that says, men shut the F up.
[2:34:25.880 --> 2:34:31.880]  They were cheering that. Then they had a man come up and speak right after that and they were cheering him.
[2:34:31.880 --> 2:34:39.880]  And then they were telling Caitlin and I, when we were going around trying to interview people and talk to them, that we should shut the F up as conservative women.
[2:34:39.880 --> 2:34:47.880]  Because why? Because we were questioning these leftists as to why they support killing babies in fantaside.
[2:34:47.880 --> 2:34:57.880]  And they were so insulted or, you know, perplexed as to why we would even question them because we should believe all women.
[2:34:57.880 --> 2:34:59.880]  We should just not question why women want to do this.
[2:34:59.880 --> 2:35:03.880]  And we've seen this by Democratic females in Congress. They go, men just shut up.
[2:35:03.880 --> 2:35:10.880]  The idea of men shutting up, women shutting up, white shutting up, black shutting up, Hispanic, nobody should shut up.
[2:35:10.880 --> 2:35:15.880]  Free speech, Martin Luther King, Magna Carta, Bill of Rights, First Amendment.
[2:35:15.880 --> 2:35:21.880]  They're so authoritarian. And like you said, everything they do is an exercise in contradiction.
[2:35:21.880 --> 2:35:29.880]  It's like this brewery, one of the biggest breweries in England, said get a break, go out and assault a conservative.
[2:35:29.880 --> 2:35:34.880]  And then when somebody said, man, you're asking for trouble, they called the police, they retreated and said, oh my God, we're being threatened.
[2:35:34.880 --> 2:35:41.880]  You're like declaring war. We're coming to kill you. People go, hey, that's not a good idea. Oh my God, you talk back to me.
[2:35:41.880 --> 2:35:47.880]  I'm calling the police. It's like something, it's like they have no governor. They have no understanding.
[2:35:47.880 --> 2:35:58.880]  Someone walked up to me and actually threatened me with a milkshake because the whole milkshake thing where they're saying that conservatives should be being assaulted by milkshakes to throw milkshakes on them.
[2:35:58.880 --> 2:36:01.880]  The guy walked up to me and said, man, I really wish I didn't forget my milkshake.
[2:36:01.880 --> 2:36:06.880]  And that was the point. That's what the brewery said. They said, stop using milkshakes. You need to physically attack Nazis.
[2:36:06.880 --> 2:36:12.880]  Anybody that doesn't do what they say is a Nazi. So these are authoritarians going, hey, people don't like Nazis.
[2:36:12.880 --> 2:36:17.880]  We'll say anybody not doing what we say is a Nazi. So here's your report and more is coming on the war room today.
[2:36:17.880 --> 2:36:20.880]  There's a lot more hadn't been aired yet because this was shot in HD.
[2:36:20.880 --> 2:36:29.880]  And then we've got Caitlin Bennett's report, who are the woman calls for killing babies up to age three, which is the official Peter, Peter Singer left his plan.
[2:36:29.880 --> 2:36:30.880]  Here it is.
[2:36:30.880 --> 2:36:32.880]  Why do you support abortion?
[2:36:32.880 --> 2:36:34.880]  I'm sorry I didn't bring a milkshake.
[2:36:34.880 --> 2:36:40.880]  If you had a friend who was raped and became pregnant, would you force her to carry that baby to turn?
[2:36:40.880 --> 2:36:43.880]  Are we guilty for the sins of our father?
[2:36:43.880 --> 2:36:44.880]  No, this guy's fault you.
[2:36:44.880 --> 2:36:45.880]  You answer me.
[2:36:45.880 --> 2:36:47.880]  Are we guilty for the sins of our father?
[2:36:47.880 --> 2:36:48.880]  What a thug.
[2:36:48.880 --> 2:36:50.880]  Would you force a friend who was raped and got pregnant to carry that baby to turn?
[2:36:50.880 --> 2:36:52.880]  Do you realize that the sins are me?
[2:36:52.880 --> 2:36:53.880]  Hit pause.
[2:36:53.880 --> 2:36:54.880]  Hit pause.
[2:36:54.880 --> 2:36:58.880]  80% of women coming through Mexico get raped, Amnesty International. He doesn't give a damn about that.
[2:36:58.880 --> 2:37:04.880]  He doesn't care. It's all about, you answer me about whether they're raped, as if that's even one tip of 100%.
[2:37:04.880 --> 2:37:06.880]  Let's continue.
[2:37:06.880 --> 2:37:09.880]  Who was raped and got pregnant to carry that baby to turn?
[2:37:09.880 --> 2:37:10.880]  Do you realize that...
[2:37:10.880 --> 2:37:11.880]  You answer me.
[2:37:11.880 --> 2:37:18.880]  Do you realize that that's a very, very small percentage of instances where women are impregnated by rape?
[2:37:18.880 --> 2:37:21.880]  It's a very small amount to justify...
[2:37:21.880 --> 2:37:23.880]  You're not going to answer me. You f*** off.
[2:37:23.880 --> 2:37:24.880]  You guys...
[2:37:24.880 --> 2:37:25.880]  Hit pause.
[2:37:25.880 --> 2:37:26.880]  Hit pause.
[2:37:26.880 --> 2:37:31.880]  He just said for radio listeners, you have off, grabbed her and shoved the mic back into her chest.
[2:37:31.880 --> 2:37:37.880]  Yes, he did. You can't see it very well in the video, but he actually did shove the mic back into my breast.
[2:37:37.880 --> 2:37:39.880]  So he did shove it into me.
[2:37:39.880 --> 2:37:41.880]  Unbelievable. Let's continue.
[2:37:41.880 --> 2:37:45.880]  You're not going to answer me. You f*** off.
[2:37:45.880 --> 2:37:46.880]  You guys...
[2:37:46.880 --> 2:37:47.880]  Wow.
[2:37:47.880 --> 2:37:49.880]  This guy just shoved me.
[2:37:49.880 --> 2:37:51.880]  You're going to understand later how wrong you are.
[2:37:51.880 --> 2:37:53.880]  This guy just shoved me.
[2:37:53.880 --> 2:37:56.880]  You'll understand later how wrong I am.
[2:37:56.880 --> 2:38:01.880]  Look at this. You're young. You don't have a son and a daughter. You haven't been on the air for six years.
[2:38:01.880 --> 2:38:06.880]  You haven't had all these jobs and done all these things. You're just subhuman. You're wrong.
[2:38:06.880 --> 2:38:10.880]  You're too young. The left's all about the young being right, but you're too young.
[2:38:10.880 --> 2:38:14.880]  Here, here, here. Back it up. Back it up, guys. We're going to play all this.
[2:38:14.880 --> 2:38:20.880]  Let's go back here. You're young. You don't know how great it is to keep...here it is.
[2:38:20.880 --> 2:38:21.880]  You are.
[2:38:21.880 --> 2:38:23.880]  This guy just shoved me.
[2:38:23.880 --> 2:38:26.880]  You'll understand later how wrong I am.
[2:38:26.880 --> 2:38:29.880]  Wrong for supporting not killing babies.
[2:38:29.880 --> 2:38:33.880]  Wrong for being against infanticide.
[2:38:33.880 --> 2:38:35.880]  Are you respecting me?
[2:38:35.880 --> 2:38:38.880]  You're changing in an interview right here and you just came and interrupted it.
[2:38:38.880 --> 2:38:40.880]  To leave women alone.
[2:38:40.880 --> 2:38:44.880]  You don't have a right to do that. It's not your choice. It's not your choice.
[2:38:44.880 --> 2:38:46.880]  You do not have a right.
[2:38:46.880 --> 2:38:48.880]  So it's not your choice to tell me to leave.
[2:38:48.880 --> 2:38:52.880]  You don't have a right to be here and counter everything a woman tells you.
[2:38:52.880 --> 2:38:54.880]  I have a right to ask you a question.
[2:38:54.880 --> 2:38:57.880]  You're a radio listener. She's at the Capitol. She's trying to interview.
[2:38:57.880 --> 2:39:00.880]  And the left always comes over and tries to say, don't talk to info wars.
[2:39:00.880 --> 2:39:04.880]  And then starts physically going after the microphone. Here it is.
[2:39:04.880 --> 2:39:06.880]  Not really here as an interviewer.
[2:39:06.880 --> 2:39:11.880]  You are here to challenge what we as women want to say.
[2:39:11.880 --> 2:39:12.880]  And you're not allowed to do that.
[2:39:12.880 --> 2:39:16.880]  You can hold a stance that you so firmly believe in that you'd be willing to take the life of babies,
[2:39:16.880 --> 2:39:18.880]  but you can't be challenged on that.
[2:39:18.880 --> 2:39:24.880]  100% of unwanted pregnancies are caused by men.
[2:39:24.880 --> 2:39:26.880]  And I don't see big parades.
[2:39:26.880 --> 2:39:27.880]  Because she says men.
[2:39:27.880 --> 2:39:28.880]  Pause again.
[2:39:28.880 --> 2:39:30.880]  And I'm not being mean to ugly women.
[2:39:30.880 --> 2:39:34.880]  What is it about feminists or all these women that either had a weird husband and have a son,
[2:39:34.880 --> 2:39:37.880]  they kind of put on Prozac and riddle and brain damage as a ritual,
[2:39:37.880 --> 2:39:41.880]  which we know it's a synthetic ritual they carry out, they admit,
[2:39:41.880 --> 2:39:44.880]  or they never had a man and everybody, they say all these men want them.
[2:39:44.880 --> 2:39:45.880]  Like they're on sex strike.
[2:39:45.880 --> 2:39:48.880]  We're like, really, we're glad you're on sex strike, lady.
[2:39:48.880 --> 2:39:53.880]  I mean, what is this thing about hating men when men and women have each other?
[2:39:53.880 --> 2:39:55.880]  We are the same species.
[2:39:55.880 --> 2:39:59.880]  It's like cutting one arm off despite the other arm. Here it is.
[2:39:59.880 --> 2:40:05.880]  100% of unwanted pregnancies are caused by men.
[2:40:05.880 --> 2:40:10.880]  And I don't see big parades of men out here with signs that say women should shut the F up.
[2:40:10.880 --> 2:40:13.880]  Who's the one being sexist out here?
[2:40:13.880 --> 2:40:15.880]  We're here, over here.
[2:40:15.880 --> 2:40:19.880]  If you guys are telling men based on their sex, they should shut the F up.
[2:40:19.880 --> 2:40:24.880]  100% of unwanted pregnancies are caused by men.
[2:40:24.880 --> 2:40:26.880]  Yeah, so why should they not have a say?
[2:40:26.880 --> 2:40:27.880]  Push your words.
[2:40:27.880 --> 2:40:29.880]  Why should they not have a say?
[2:40:29.880 --> 2:40:30.880]  They should have a say.
[2:40:30.880 --> 2:40:34.880]  They should take their business and keep it to themselves.
[2:40:34.880 --> 2:40:36.880]  They should have their testicles.
[2:40:36.880 --> 2:40:37.880]  Hey, pause again.
[2:40:37.880 --> 2:40:38.880]  Regularly.
[2:40:38.880 --> 2:40:44.880]  But if the woman then decides to have the baby, then he's got to pay them.
[2:40:44.880 --> 2:40:46.880]  So he has no say, but he's going to pay.
[2:40:46.880 --> 2:40:47.880]  Yeah, she says.
[2:40:47.880 --> 2:40:49.880]  That's taxation without representation.
[2:40:49.880 --> 2:40:52.880]  She says 100% of men.
[2:40:52.880 --> 2:40:53.880]  And she says men like you.
[2:40:53.880 --> 2:40:57.880]  Men like this alien force, I mean, you've got a son.
[2:40:57.880 --> 2:40:58.880]  You've got a daughter.
[2:40:58.880 --> 2:40:59.880]  I've got a son.
[2:40:59.880 --> 2:41:00.880]  I've got daughters.
[2:41:00.880 --> 2:41:02.880]  And I never thought of the sexist as even different.
[2:41:02.880 --> 2:41:03.880]  We're just humanity.
[2:41:03.880 --> 2:41:07.880]  But once you have a son, you have a daughter, you really get, we are one whole thing.
[2:41:07.880 --> 2:41:09.880]  Like abolish the family.
[2:41:09.880 --> 2:41:10.880]  The family is humanity.
[2:41:10.880 --> 2:41:15.880]  And you realize how much men need women and how much women need men.
[2:41:15.880 --> 2:41:19.880]  And she says, man, like she hates men.
[2:41:19.880 --> 2:41:23.880]  At the end there, I don't know if you caught it off, but she literally talked about how men should have there.
[2:41:23.880 --> 2:41:25.880]  And she kind of pauses testicles.
[2:41:25.880 --> 2:41:28.880]  And it sounds like she wants to say cut off.
[2:41:28.880 --> 2:41:29.880]  Oh yeah.
[2:41:29.880 --> 2:41:30.880]  Oh yeah.
[2:41:30.880 --> 2:41:31.880]  But then she says, regulated.
[2:41:31.880 --> 2:41:32.880]  We're going to go to break them up at the back of them.
[2:41:32.880 --> 2:41:33.880]  Let's finish the end of this tape.
[2:41:33.880 --> 2:41:38.880]  And then even more shocking videos coming up where they call for killing children up to age three because they're so,
[2:41:38.880 --> 2:41:41.880]  they want to vaccinate them though, but they want to kill them too.
[2:41:41.880 --> 2:41:42.880]  Here it is.
[2:41:42.880 --> 2:41:44.880]  Why should they not have a say?
[2:41:44.880 --> 2:41:47.880]  Why should they not have a say?
[2:41:47.880 --> 2:41:49.880]  They should have a say.
[2:41:49.880 --> 2:41:52.880]  They should take their business and keep it to themselves.
[2:41:52.880 --> 2:41:57.880]  They should have their testicles regulated.
[2:41:57.880 --> 2:41:59.880]  Why not?
[2:41:59.880 --> 2:42:01.880]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:42:01.880 --> 2:42:03.880]  We're not judging anyone that ever had an abortion.
[2:42:03.880 --> 2:42:04.880]  We get it.
[2:42:04.880 --> 2:42:05.880]  You're scared.
[2:42:05.880 --> 2:42:06.880]  You're out of money.
[2:42:06.880 --> 2:42:07.880]  You don't like the guy.
[2:42:07.880 --> 2:42:08.880]  Whatever.
[2:42:08.880 --> 2:42:10.880]  The point is they've medicalized that they're killing babies after they're born.
[2:42:10.880 --> 2:42:11.880]  Third trimester.
[2:42:11.880 --> 2:42:12.880]  There's no reason to do that.
[2:42:12.880 --> 2:42:15.880]  And now they want to keep them alive and sell their organs.
[2:42:15.880 --> 2:42:17.880]  It's a business now.
[2:42:17.880 --> 2:42:18.880]  It's evil.
[2:42:18.880 --> 2:42:20.880]  And it's a sacrament to the left.
[2:42:20.880 --> 2:42:23.880]  And I think that's why Generation Z is like 80% against abortion.
[2:42:23.880 --> 2:42:25.880]  Even the millennials are half against it.
[2:42:25.880 --> 2:42:27.880]  The numbers are turning against abortion, Millie.
[2:42:27.880 --> 2:42:28.880]  Exactly.
[2:42:28.880 --> 2:42:34.880]  And these women's groups should actually be rallying around and supporting women that become pregnant unintentionally
[2:42:34.880 --> 2:42:38.880]  and finding ways to help them through their pregnancies and support them.
[2:42:38.880 --> 2:42:41.880]  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[2:42:41.880 --> 2:42:43.880]  I always forget to point this out.
[2:42:43.880 --> 2:42:44.880]  Thanks for bringing that up.
[2:42:44.880 --> 2:42:45.880]  Weever is in Fuego.
[2:42:45.880 --> 2:42:46.880]  We'll talk to her on the other side.
[2:42:46.880 --> 2:42:50.880]  And play Caitlyn Bennett's report where they call for killing children up to age three.
[2:42:50.880 --> 2:42:52.880]  Pretty soon they'll say that's bigotive.
[2:42:52.880 --> 2:42:54.880]  You don't blow their brains out.
[2:42:54.880 --> 2:42:57.880]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing.
[2:42:57.880 --> 2:43:00.880]  That what God gave us from other nature is incredible.
[2:43:00.880 --> 2:43:03.880]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world.
[2:43:03.880 --> 2:43:05.880]  And the globalists are so upset.
[2:43:05.880 --> 2:43:08.880]  The problem is people forget to take them.
[2:43:08.880 --> 2:43:13.880]  And that's why the whole industry has moved towards packets that you take in the morning
[2:43:13.880 --> 2:43:14.880]  and take at night.
[2:43:14.880 --> 2:43:15.880]  So we looked at that.

[2:44:56.440 --> 2:45:01.800]  The globalists are hyper competitive, scientific dictators. They are technocrats. They are
[2:45:01.800 --> 2:45:05.880]  control freaks in their own words. And they believe allowing you to live your own life
[2:45:05.880 --> 2:45:10.880]  and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[2:45:10.880 --> 2:45:14.640]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the
[2:45:14.640 --> 2:45:19.160]  3rd dimension. But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really
[2:45:19.160 --> 2:45:24.360]  got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies. If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements
[2:45:24.360 --> 2:45:30.200]  from 4slife.com, I couldn't do it. That's why we decided to take our original Secret

[2:46:59.880 --> 2:47:06.880]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:30.880 --> 2:47:39.880]  But it wasn't because I didn't know enough. I know way too much. That's the problem. These
[2:47:39.880 --> 2:47:45.880]  gums can't move fast enough to give me the intel. Does it make me crazy? Yeah, it makes
[2:47:45.880 --> 2:47:51.880]  me crazy. World government that's anti-human, anti-family exterminism told you that 20-something
[2:47:51.880 --> 2:47:55.880]  years ago because it was in all their textbooks. Now it's not in their textbooks, they're doing
[2:47:55.880 --> 2:48:00.120]  it in the real world. Millie Weaver, you and your husband Gavin do an incredible job on
[2:48:00.120 --> 2:48:03.880]  the road across this country with your son and now daughter. I couldn't believe two weeks
[2:48:03.880 --> 2:48:08.040]  after you had your baby daughter. You were already out there doing reports. Congratulations
[2:48:08.040 --> 2:48:14.520]  to you as just an amazing woman, an amazing human. We've got this Caitlyn Bennett who
[2:48:14.520 --> 2:48:19.120]  you recruited to work with us and has just been doing a spectacular job in under attack.
[2:48:19.120 --> 2:48:24.720]  We're going to go to this next report from the same pro-death rally at the Capitol with
[2:48:24.720 --> 2:48:28.640]  the anti-free speech left us. Give us a prelude to what we're about to see.
[2:48:28.640 --> 2:48:35.560]  Well, Caitlyn Bennett, she interviewed women and people on the pier. This was actually
[2:48:35.560 --> 2:48:42.640]  down in Galveston and these girls, when she asked them about their stance on abortion,
[2:48:42.640 --> 2:48:48.240]  they essentially wanted to say that fostered babies, their whole reason for supporting
[2:48:48.240 --> 2:48:52.080]  abortion so that you don't have children in foster care. But then Caitlyn says, well,
[2:48:52.080 --> 2:48:56.960]  would you be willing to look a foster child in the face and say you should have been aborted?
[2:48:56.960 --> 2:49:01.000]  And she's like, yeah, I would say that to him. And again, some of this is at the beach
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:04.560]  this weekend. Some of this is what happened in Austin yesterday, but I have articles
[2:49:04.560 --> 2:49:10.720]  today admitting even mainline news that Alabama is adopting more babies than is even being
[2:49:10.720 --> 2:49:14.640]  aborted. And that's what I was going to say before the break you brought up. When you
[2:49:14.640 --> 2:49:18.800]  see Catholic charities that are doing a good job and some of these billboards saying pregnant
[2:49:18.800 --> 2:49:23.360]  need help, you know, don't abort. The average woman and the left always says nobody wants
[2:49:23.360 --> 2:49:30.280]  a Mexican baby or a black baby. That is a load of crap. My family adopted a Korean baby.
[2:49:30.280 --> 2:49:35.560]  They just wanted a good, healthy baby. They had a boy. My mom got sterilized by the Dal
[2:49:35.560 --> 2:49:39.920]  Khan Shield. She wanted legal case on that. She wanted to have more kids. They said, oh,
[2:49:39.920 --> 2:49:43.760]  no problem sterilizer right away. That was a problem. She wanted to have kids try artificial
[2:49:43.760 --> 2:49:48.840]  insemination, went through hell, adopted my sister, took five years, hundreds of thousands
[2:49:48.840 --> 2:49:56.840]  of dollars. And we're talking to like 1992. Okay, 1992, 1991 to get my sister from South
[2:49:56.840 --> 2:50:01.640]  Korea who was, and I love her and she, she watches and she's really great. But your
[2:50:01.640 --> 2:50:07.360]  ghost child in South Korea, if you come from a single mother, you're not seen as in society.
[2:50:07.360 --> 2:50:11.800]  So they have a surplus little girls, especially she's a wonderful, smart, great person. But
[2:50:11.800 --> 2:50:19.560]  you go up, these leftist go nobody wants minorities, but it's Christians, mainly white, that are
[2:50:19.560 --> 2:50:24.400]  adopting the black and Hispanic babies. And they have black groups that say you shouldn't
[2:50:24.400 --> 2:50:29.320]  be able to adopt the black person of your white just to kill them. That's a nationwide movement.
[2:50:29.320 --> 2:50:35.200]  So, you know, abortion is actually in a way kind of sexist. And it's funny that the feminists
[2:50:35.200 --> 2:50:40.080]  actually don't point this out. Most of these countries like India, China, they all abort
[2:50:40.080 --> 2:50:44.040]  female babies if they find out. They don't want babies. They want males. And now these
[2:50:44.040 --> 2:50:48.360]  countries have surpluses of men and the men can't ever find one. And we're the feminists.
[2:50:48.360 --> 2:50:52.400]  That's the most sexist thing in the world that in India, and in China and everywhere,
[2:50:52.400 --> 2:50:56.120]  people don't want girls. The West is all about girls. They kill them. And in the West, they
[2:50:56.120 --> 2:51:01.400]  tell us we're not pro girl. They kill them. They murder it. They've had to ban ultrasounds
[2:51:01.400 --> 2:51:05.840]  in some of these countries because in India, if they find out it's a girl, they will kill
[2:51:05.840 --> 2:51:11.680]  the girl baby, abort it. And again, India has its own problems. I'm not attacking their
[2:51:11.680 --> 2:51:16.160]  people in general, but they have the whole dowry system where women's families have
[2:51:16.160 --> 2:51:19.520]  to pay to take their daughter. And then the men will just fire bomb them. They'll gas
[2:51:19.520 --> 2:51:23.760]  poor gas on them, burn them to death. And they'll marry five or six women. But the left doesn't
[2:51:23.760 --> 2:51:30.720]  say a damn word about it. They just tell us how in the West where we put women on a pedestal
[2:51:30.720 --> 2:51:34.680]  that we don't like women and I'm sick of it. Yeah. I mean, even that article just said
[2:51:34.680 --> 2:51:41.240]  the real war on women, the real war on women, which is a war on humanity is abortion. Women
[2:51:41.240 --> 2:51:47.880]  are having the babies. Women are humanity. So the state wants to run women like a pimp.
[2:51:47.880 --> 2:51:55.280]  That's it. So here is this report. I will tell women again, you can get and you talk
[2:51:55.280 --> 2:52:01.360]  about racist. It is because elite families want white babies. You get $200,000 for a
[2:52:01.360 --> 2:52:08.080]  black baby. You can get $300,000 for a Hispanic baby. You can get $400,000 for a white baby
[2:52:08.080 --> 2:52:13.520]  and for a black haired blue eyed baby. You can get up to $600,000, $700,000. Now that's
[2:52:13.520 --> 2:52:19.080]  a fact on the market, but they're not telling these women, Hey, you can have that baby because
[2:52:19.080 --> 2:52:22.320]  they just want babies dead at the abortion. They're getting their kickback, their money
[2:52:22.320 --> 2:52:26.200]  plant parent who makes a few thousand dollars in kickbacks. Every baby they kill and they
[2:52:26.200 --> 2:52:30.280]  get bonuses for black and Hispanic babies. That's what they were set up to do with market
[2:52:30.280 --> 2:52:35.560]  singer. This is a fact, but the point is they're not telling a poor woman, Hey, they're a Christian
[2:52:35.560 --> 2:52:42.040]  families that want to adopt your baby. They'll even get you a job after it will pick up $100,000.
[2:52:42.040 --> 2:52:48.240]  They won't tell these women that the women go pay to have their baby chopped up and then
[2:52:48.240 --> 2:52:52.040]  it causes cervical cancer, ovarian cancer. If you terminate a pregnancy when you're not
[2:52:52.040 --> 2:52:57.560]  supposed to, your body starts trying to kill you. I actually know a woman who told me her
[2:52:57.560 --> 2:53:02.080]  story and she's Christian now and she deeply regrets having had an abortion when she was
[2:53:02.080 --> 2:53:07.360]  younger because it actually made it so she can no longer ever have children and she's
[2:53:07.360 --> 2:53:08.360]  really heartbroken.
[2:53:08.360 --> 2:53:10.240]  Oh yeah. A lot of times they sterilize you while they're at it.
[2:53:10.240 --> 2:53:13.320]  Yeah. She's like, I had an abortion and now I can never have kids.
[2:53:13.320 --> 2:53:17.000]  Well, you have all the secret experimentation over the years. Millie, as you know, you're
[2:53:17.000 --> 2:53:21.800]  walking into the original plan parent who was set up by the eugenicist by market singer.
[2:53:21.800 --> 2:53:26.760]  Market singer was best friends with Hitler, got awards from him and Hitler wrote letters
[2:53:26.760 --> 2:53:28.880]  to her back and forth praising her.
[2:53:28.880 --> 2:53:32.080]  Yeah. She was a vehement racist, market singer.
[2:53:32.080 --> 2:53:37.000]  But then again, folks, people say, well, hey, the minorities want to kill whites. Why not
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:42.320]  kill them? That's what I'm getting at here, folks. This is much deeper. This is insane.
[2:53:42.320 --> 2:53:46.200]  This is evil. You're not going to kill babies whether they're white or black and go to heaven,
[2:53:46.200 --> 2:53:50.760]  folks. People can make jokes about that all day. You can't do it. Here is the true face
[2:53:50.760 --> 2:53:51.760]  of evil.
[2:53:51.760 --> 2:53:56.880]  Caitlin Bennett's newest video. We're going to post in forwards.com. Here it is. You're
[2:53:56.880 --> 2:54:01.920]  willing and there's over a million children, babies every year that are aborted. There'd
[2:54:01.920 --> 2:54:06.480]  be a million and a half people in foster homes like my point right there. Thank you. Thank
[2:54:06.480 --> 2:54:15.760]  you. Hey, that's disappointing guys. That's disgusting. That's disgusting. This is Galveston,
[2:54:15.760 --> 2:54:22.760]  Texas. How old are you? How old is she? She's 18. Oh, okay. You just looked so very young.
[2:54:22.760 --> 2:54:30.320]  You're so cute. In your lady's opinion, when does human life begin? When the child was
[2:54:30.320 --> 2:54:37.240]  born, when the life is in the world. I mean, so it has to pass the birth canal and able
[2:54:37.240 --> 2:54:45.280]  for it to be a human life, for being accountable. Yeah, living life. What's the difference between
[2:54:45.280 --> 2:54:51.880]  the day before it's born and the day after? It's here. Is it not here when it's in the
[2:54:51.880 --> 2:54:58.440]  womb? Like birth certificate doesn't have any. So a birth certificate determines life.
[2:54:58.440 --> 2:55:05.640]  No, but I mean, there's already plenty of kids that don't have families. Why put more
[2:55:05.640 --> 2:55:12.000]  in the foster system and in foster homes and pause again. The idea is if you kill somebody,
[2:55:12.000 --> 2:55:16.160]  that makes more resources. That's what Bill Gates teaches. Kill grandma, get money for
[2:55:16.160 --> 2:55:20.600]  10 teachers. So they've already bought this idea. If we kill people, they'll be more resources
[2:55:20.600 --> 2:55:25.480]  instead of building a civilization. This is the essence of evil, folks continue. Foster
[2:55:25.480 --> 2:55:30.960]  home. Yes. Then to be dead. It is by far worse to be in foster home to foster home to foster
[2:55:30.960 --> 2:55:35.560]  home than to not even be open up to all that pain and hurt them, not having parents and
[2:55:35.560 --> 2:55:39.760]  not having somebody to love you and being tossed around. I'd rather cut somebody off
[2:55:39.760 --> 2:55:44.600]  who has no clue that they're born. Nobody knows they're born. Nobody's, they can feel
[2:55:44.600 --> 2:55:49.760]  the pain. No, you don't remember. I mean, when you were five months old, did you remember
[2:55:49.760 --> 2:55:54.880]  being born? Is it okay to kill a five month old? When you, when you fell when you were
[2:55:54.880 --> 2:55:59.080]  five months old, do you remember how it felt? No, but you guys' argument is it can't feel
[2:55:59.080 --> 2:56:02.840]  when it's in the womb. So it's okay to cut them off before they have to. It's not even
[2:56:02.840 --> 2:56:12.000]  it's not even, it's not even. They can feel the pain. No, it's not even. It's, it's,
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:15.640]  if somebody's pregnant and they don't want it, they don't have to have it. They shouldn't
[2:56:15.640 --> 2:56:19.160]  like to have it. What if someone has mental issues and they're not capable of even going
[2:56:19.160 --> 2:56:24.160]  through birth to give up the kid for adoption? They should. That has nothing to do with mental.
[2:56:24.160 --> 2:56:27.720]  That's not mental issues. Yeah, it is. I mean, that's what mental issues are. These women
[2:56:27.720 --> 2:56:33.120]  are so gross. I've never touched them. Yeah, I mean, I can take care of myself sometimes.
[2:56:33.120 --> 2:56:38.520]  What if, you know, what if I, you know, that's a lot. I can barely take care of myself sometimes.
[2:56:38.520 --> 2:56:43.640]  I can barely take care of myself sometimes. Do you think they usually take precautions
[2:56:43.640 --> 2:56:48.360]  not to conceive a child? You're, you take precautions. You take all the precautions
[2:56:48.360 --> 2:56:52.000]  you can and you still, some people still get pregnant and take your responsibility and
[2:56:52.000 --> 2:56:57.240]  don't, don't get rid of a human life. This is the thing that is going on right now. We're
[2:56:57.240 --> 2:57:02.200]  still in Texas. Like we can still, we're going to come back. And in case you missed it, we're
[2:57:02.200 --> 2:57:07.120]  going to play it again where they say kill babies up to age three. The selfish, evil
[2:57:07.120 --> 2:57:12.880]  blobs, Millie. It's disgusting and very disturbing because babies do feel pain. They actually
[2:57:12.880 --> 2:57:17.560]  feel more pain. I've read, there's the videos where they fight the scalpel. They fight like
[2:57:17.560 --> 2:57:21.640]  it's a knife fight. Yeah, it's worse. It's 10 times worse for them because they haven't
[2:57:21.640 --> 2:57:26.080]  had the pruning of their nerves yet. They feel people don't know this, but their studies
[2:57:26.080 --> 2:57:29.960]  I've read, they're really sick. A baby expects to be held in love. You throw them in water.
[2:57:29.960 --> 2:57:33.560]  They fight for their lives. They try to climb out. You start attacking them. They fight.
[2:57:33.560 --> 2:57:37.560]  Oh yeah. They tried to give my son a vitamin K shot, which I'd authorized. He literally
[2:57:37.560 --> 2:57:40.920]  grabbed the nurse's hand and pulled it away. We'll be right back. Ladies and gentlemen,

[2:58:50.000 --> 2:58:54.360]  for calling Mike. You are the man, Alex. I'm so glad to be talking to you. I'm so excited.
[2:58:54.360 --> 2:58:58.080]  I'm such a big fan ever since I've been listening. I've been buying your products. I got to
[2:58:58.080 --> 2:59:05.880]  do a shout out for the bone broth, the bone broth, the bone broth, the bone broth, the
[2:59:05.880 --> 2:59:10.840]  bone tastes like tastes like great milkshake. You know, if you just add it to milk, it tastes
[2:59:10.840 --> 2:59:16.960]  like oval theme. It tastes like oval theme. It tastes like oval theme. Like good. I feel
[2:59:16.960 --> 2:59:22.760]  great since I've been taking it. My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride free toothpaste.
[2:59:22.760 --> 2:59:27.400]  I've used the super male vitality, a host of other products. So thank you so much for
[2:59:27.400 --> 2:59:30.880]  that as well. Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products to keep me somewhere.
[2:59:30.880 --> 2:59:35.040]  I'm thanking you. But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the
[2:59:35.040 --> 2:59:39.760]  chocolate mushroom, the true bone broth. It is next level. It really is good. So thank
[2:59:39.760 --> 2:59:49.400]  you. I feel great since I've been taking it. Thank you.
[2:59:49.400 --> 3:00:16.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:16.160 --> 3:00:23.600]  You know, Millie Weaver and Caitlyn Bennett need their own show here at M4. They're so
[3:00:23.600 --> 3:00:29.200]  busy on the road and they're kicking ass. I don't want to tie them down with that. But
[3:00:29.200 --> 3:00:34.160]  Will Johnson is coming up after the next segment. We're going to air part of an interview. She
[3:00:34.160 --> 3:00:38.760]  did. She was here with her beautiful three-month-old daughter who's here in town right now and her
[3:00:38.760 --> 3:00:43.560]  husband. And what they went through at the hospital, the medicalization, all of it, that's
[3:00:43.560 --> 3:00:48.880]  coming up next segment. This is important for everybody to see and to share. But finishing
[3:00:48.880 --> 3:00:52.480]  up, the leftists now say, kill babies after they're born. And so I was saying this woman
[3:00:52.480 --> 3:00:57.000]  says three years. That's what Peter Singer says. She says there's no limit. So let's
[3:00:57.000 --> 3:00:59.600]  finish this interview. Here it is.
[3:00:59.600 --> 3:01:02.600]  Great. So what time do we cut abortions off?
[3:01:02.600 --> 3:01:03.600]  We're supposed to meet.
[3:01:03.600 --> 3:01:06.560]  Okay. Do you guys believe in gun control?
[3:01:06.560 --> 3:01:08.640]  I mean, in different areas.
[3:01:08.640 --> 3:01:09.640]  Yeah.
[3:01:09.640 --> 3:01:12.960]  So you're stripping my rights away, but me standing up for the unborn is stripping your
[3:01:12.960 --> 3:01:13.960]  rights away.
[3:01:13.960 --> 3:01:15.760]  We're not going to take all the guns, but make it harder.
[3:01:15.760 --> 3:01:19.560]  So we're not going to limit all the abortions just when it has a heartbeat and it's a human
[3:01:19.560 --> 3:01:20.960]  life. Is that okay? Can we compromise?
[3:01:20.960 --> 3:01:21.960]  Okay.
[3:01:21.960 --> 3:01:25.120]  If the mother isn't capable of taking care of a child, I don't think she should go through
[3:01:25.120 --> 3:01:26.520]  birth or have to go through birth.
[3:01:26.520 --> 3:01:30.160]  Are you willing to look at a lot of children in the foster care system and say you should
[3:01:30.160 --> 3:01:32.240]  have been aborted instead of being here in this home?
[3:01:32.240 --> 3:01:36.440]  No, I'm sorry that, you know, your family, and I mean, they should probably some, you
[3:01:36.440 --> 3:01:37.440]  know?
[3:01:37.440 --> 3:01:38.440]  I'm sure.
[3:01:38.440 --> 3:01:39.440]  There's half a million kids in foster care.
[3:01:39.440 --> 3:01:40.440]  There's half a million kids in foster care.
[3:01:40.440 --> 3:01:41.440]  You're willing?
[3:01:41.440 --> 3:01:42.440]  There's half a million kids in foster care.
[3:01:42.440 --> 3:01:45.440]  There's over a million children, babies, every year that are aborted.
[3:01:45.440 --> 3:01:49.360]  Thank God there'd be a million and a half people in foster homes like my point right
[3:01:49.360 --> 3:01:50.360]  there.
[3:01:50.360 --> 3:01:51.360]  Thank you.
[3:01:51.360 --> 3:01:52.360]  Thank you.
[3:01:52.360 --> 3:01:53.360]  That's disappointing guys.
[3:01:53.360 --> 3:01:54.360]  That's disgusting.
[3:01:54.360 --> 3:01:55.360]  That's disgusting.
[3:01:55.360 --> 3:01:56.360]  Somebody likes you.
[3:01:56.360 --> 3:01:57.860]  I don't know why you're insisting.
[3:01:57.860 --> 3:01:58.860]  That's disgusting.
[3:01:58.860 --> 3:01:59.860]  Okay.
[3:01:59.860 --> 3:02:01.360]  All right.
[3:02:01.360 --> 3:02:03.520]  That man needs to get them on a leash.
[3:02:03.520 --> 3:02:04.520]  All right.
[3:02:04.520 --> 3:02:10.240]  Take control of the women in your life, sir.
[3:02:10.240 --> 3:02:14.880]  She just said, so she just said I should have been aborted, which is admitting that abortion
[3:02:14.880 --> 3:02:15.880]  is murder.
[3:02:15.880 --> 3:02:16.880]  So thank you very much.
[3:02:16.880 --> 3:02:18.760]  They don't belong in Texas.
[3:02:18.760 --> 3:02:22.320]  Ironically, this is not the average response we've been getting today.
[3:02:22.320 --> 3:02:26.520]  A lot of people have been saying life begins at conception.
[3:02:26.520 --> 3:02:31.000]  And if they don't say conception, they say a heartbeat because it is common sense.
[3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:32.400]  It is literally common sense.
[3:02:32.400 --> 3:02:33.760]  Are they coming back?
[3:02:33.760 --> 3:02:34.760]  Look at them.
[3:02:34.760 --> 3:02:36.680]  That's enough of them.
[3:02:36.680 --> 3:02:41.240]  You know, we had that video two weeks ago, the Alabama senator saying, if we don't kill
[3:02:41.240 --> 3:02:43.480]  them in the womb, we're going to kill them later.
[3:02:43.480 --> 3:02:44.480]  These are bad people.
[3:02:44.480 --> 3:02:45.680]  They have bad genes.
[3:02:45.680 --> 3:02:46.680]  That is so Nazi.
[3:02:46.680 --> 3:02:49.200]  That is so dangerous, Millie.
[3:02:49.200 --> 3:02:54.560]  It's very dangerous, you know, and it's about dehumanizing babies.
[3:02:54.560 --> 3:02:57.000]  They essentially try to say, oh, they're not babies.
[3:02:57.000 --> 3:02:58.480]  They're not human.
[3:02:58.480 --> 3:03:00.160]  Where have we heard that, Alex?
[3:03:00.160 --> 3:03:03.760]  Where have we heard people saying they're not human, therefore they should be killed?
[3:03:03.760 --> 3:03:06.800]  Well, gee, that sounds like something the Nazis said.
[3:03:06.800 --> 3:03:10.960]  That sounds like the justification they gave to kill millions of Jewish people.
[3:03:10.960 --> 3:03:11.960]  Well, absolutely.
[3:03:11.960 --> 3:03:15.640]  And so many of our best scientists and best people come from really poor backgrounds.
[3:03:15.640 --> 3:03:16.640]  They're disabled.
[3:03:16.640 --> 3:03:23.040]  Here, here, let's play this Alabama senator saying kill, kill them before they're born.
[3:03:23.040 --> 3:03:24.040]  Kill the black people.
[3:03:24.040 --> 3:03:25.040]  Here it is.
[3:03:25.040 --> 3:03:29.040]  All I'm saying to you, it all will be a woman's choice.
[3:03:29.040 --> 3:03:33.920]  I'm not about to be as a male tell a woman what to do with her body.
[3:03:33.920 --> 3:03:34.920]  Yeah, you don't want any responsibility.
[3:03:34.920 --> 3:03:43.360]  She has the right to make that decision herself directly, he has said.
[3:03:43.360 --> 3:03:44.360]  Some kids are unwanted.
[3:03:44.360 --> 3:03:48.840]  So you kill them now, I kill them later.
[3:03:48.840 --> 3:03:53.920]  You bring them into the world unwanted, unloved, they sent them to a vector chair.
[3:03:53.920 --> 3:03:57.600]  So you kill them now, I kill them later.
[3:03:57.600 --> 3:04:01.440]  But the bottom line is that I think we should be making this decision.
[3:04:01.440 --> 3:04:02.440]  All right, there you go.
[3:04:02.440 --> 3:04:04.080]  So this is a woman's choice.
[3:04:04.080 --> 3:04:07.160]  No, the state wants the organs, they're getting caught.
[3:04:07.160 --> 3:04:08.160]  They're in trouble, Millie.
[3:04:08.160 --> 3:04:09.160]  I think they're scared.
[3:04:09.160 --> 3:04:13.120]  Well, he's admitting right there, kill them now or kill them later.
[3:04:13.120 --> 3:04:14.120]  Kill them.
[3:04:14.120 --> 3:04:15.760]  He's admitting it's murder.
[3:04:15.760 --> 3:04:19.480]  He's admitting that these are human beings that we're killing, which the left likes to
[3:04:19.480 --> 3:04:20.480]  try to deny.
[3:04:20.480 --> 3:04:21.480]  They say it's not human.
[3:04:21.480 --> 3:04:26.460]  By the way, I still folks about going to anti-abortion rallies and there'd always be some weird local
[3:04:26.460 --> 3:04:29.680]  black leader come over and say, we don't want black people, we got to kill them.
[3:04:29.680 --> 3:04:31.080]  Now they say it on tape.
[3:04:31.080 --> 3:04:33.080]  He's talking about killing black people.
[3:04:33.080 --> 3:04:38.680]  It's discussing the racism within the Democrats is there for everyone to see.
[3:04:38.680 --> 3:04:41.800]  Millie, your incredible interview with your husband, your newborn daughter is coming up
[3:04:41.800 --> 3:04:46.680]  and then Will Johnson is locked and loaded in full wars.com, news wars.com, spread the
[3:04:46.680 --> 3:04:49.800]  live links to the show, info wars.com, four slash show.
[3:04:49.800 --> 3:04:55.080]  You are incredible.
[3:04:55.080 --> 3:05:02.440]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[3:05:02.440 --> 3:05:16.080]  This is a digital AI enforced gag order not to say the name Alex Jones or info wars.com.
[3:05:16.080 --> 3:05:17.800]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[3:05:17.800 --> 3:05:19.000]  This is racketeering.
[3:05:19.000 --> 3:05:20.000]  This is cartels.
[3:05:20.000 --> 3:05:22.520]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[3:05:22.520 --> 3:05:24.400]  We need it now.
[3:05:24.400 --> 3:05:26.080]  You can take on big tech.
[3:05:26.080 --> 3:05:32.840]  They saw info wars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family,
[3:05:32.840 --> 3:05:35.040]  populist organization.
[3:05:35.040 --> 3:05:40.080]  So they thought first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the
[3:05:40.080 --> 3:05:43.040]  air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[3:05:43.040 --> 3:05:47.960]  The way to fight back is to support info wars now more than ever and make it a standard
[3:05:47.960 --> 3:05:51.960]  of freedom and free speech, understand that they believe they can take us down, they'll
[3:05:51.960 --> 3:06:05.160]  take everybody else down.
[3:06:05.160 --> 3:06:09.960]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[3:06:09.960 --> 3:06:13.800]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:06:13.800 --> 3:06:18.240]  This is Alma, my three month old baby daughter.
[3:06:18.240 --> 3:06:23.680]  And she is what a perfectly healthy, unvaccinated baby looks like.
[3:06:23.680 --> 3:06:25.720]  She's in all the top charts.
[3:06:25.720 --> 3:06:27.160]  She's off the records.
[3:06:27.160 --> 3:06:32.040]  I mean, she is so healthy and the doctors in the beginning, they tried to pressure me
[3:06:32.040 --> 3:06:33.920]  into vaccinating her.
[3:06:33.920 --> 3:06:40.600]  But now she's surpassing all the other babies that she was behind initially that were vaccinated.
[3:06:40.600 --> 3:06:43.320]  So there she is.
[3:06:43.320 --> 3:06:45.760]  So she was born C-section.
[3:06:45.760 --> 3:06:50.520]  And of course with C-section babies, she was suctioned after she was born.
[3:06:50.520 --> 3:06:55.120]  And that's when they kind of put a big suction thing in the back of your throat and kind
[3:06:55.120 --> 3:06:56.760]  of remove fluids.
[3:06:56.760 --> 3:07:01.480]  But when she had her first baby checkup appointment, they looked in the back of her throat and
[3:07:01.480 --> 3:07:06.840]  they saw that she had a little bit of a scratch or sore at the back of her throat.
[3:07:06.840 --> 3:07:08.920]  And so the doctors freaked out.
[3:07:08.920 --> 3:07:14.400]  They thought that maybe she had a sore, maybe she came in contact with some herpes virus
[3:07:14.400 --> 3:07:16.120]  or something at the hospital.
[3:07:16.120 --> 3:07:19.800]  They were asking me about my medical history and I'm like, no, I've never had any type
[3:07:19.800 --> 3:07:21.240]  of herpes or anything.
[3:07:21.240 --> 3:07:23.720]  Plus, she wasn't even born vaginally.
[3:07:23.720 --> 3:07:25.560]  She was born with a C-section.
[3:07:25.560 --> 3:07:30.560]  Nonetheless, they wanted to send her to a hospital immediately.
[3:07:30.560 --> 3:07:33.680]  But I was like, no, I don't think she needs to be at a hospital.
[3:07:33.680 --> 3:07:34.760]  She doesn't have a fever.
[3:07:34.760 --> 3:07:35.760]  She's fine.
[3:07:35.760 --> 3:07:36.760]  She's healthy.
[3:07:36.760 --> 3:07:43.060]  They said, go to Walgreens, Rite Aid, get a thermometer and monitor her.
[3:07:43.060 --> 3:07:49.120]  If she spikes a fever, even if it's over 100.3, bring her into the ER.
[3:07:49.120 --> 3:07:50.760]  So I was doing that.
[3:07:50.760 --> 3:07:57.920]  And of course, a day or two later, I took her temperature and it said 100.6.
[3:07:57.920 --> 3:08:01.800]  So I thought, oh my gosh, maybe she did come into contact with something at the hospital.
[3:08:01.800 --> 3:08:05.480]  I should take her into the ER and get her checked out.
[3:08:05.480 --> 3:08:06.920]  So of course I go.
[3:08:06.920 --> 3:08:12.280]  As soon as I get to the ER, the doctors then take her temperature with their thermometer
[3:08:12.280 --> 3:08:14.680]  and it says she doesn't have a fever.
[3:08:14.680 --> 3:08:17.480]  So I then say, wait a second, let's check mine.
[3:08:17.480 --> 3:08:18.480]  So I checked mine.
[3:08:18.480 --> 3:08:19.480]  It said she had a fever.
[3:08:19.480 --> 3:08:21.480]  They checked theirs again, no fever.
[3:08:21.480 --> 3:08:28.920]  So I quickly realized that this cheap little $5 thermometer I got at the drugstore was faulty.
[3:08:28.920 --> 3:08:30.640]  Something wasn't very accurate.
[3:08:30.640 --> 3:08:35.160]  I trust the hospital's calibrated equipment more than this little cheap one.
[3:08:35.160 --> 3:08:36.160]  So what did they say?
[3:08:36.160 --> 3:08:40.280]  They said, we need to get a blood sample and a urine sample.
[3:08:40.280 --> 3:08:44.920]  So of course, I was thinking, okay, sure, maybe a little prick or heel like we've seen
[3:08:44.920 --> 3:08:47.200]  or somehow collect urine.
[3:08:47.200 --> 3:08:48.200]  No, no, no.
[3:08:48.200 --> 3:08:51.280]  All of a sudden before I knew it, they're wheeling in all this crazy equipment.
[3:08:51.280 --> 3:08:57.680]  All these people come in, they shove a catheter in her and she's screaming.
[3:08:57.680 --> 3:09:00.760]  And I was like, whoa, wait a second, no, what are we doing here?
[3:09:00.760 --> 3:09:03.040]  Oh, this is the only way we can get urine.
[3:09:03.040 --> 3:09:09.040]  They start having nurses stick needles in her arms to try to get a vein.
[3:09:09.040 --> 3:09:13.520]  Of course, she's reeling and screaming in pain and I start freaking out, panicking and
[3:09:13.520 --> 3:09:19.600]  crying because I'm watching my poor baby writhe in pain.
[3:09:19.600 --> 3:09:20.840]  And I'm like, stop.
[3:09:20.840 --> 3:09:22.120]  I don't want this.
[3:09:22.120 --> 3:09:23.120]  We need to go.
[3:09:23.120 --> 3:09:24.600]  I do not want to be here anymore.
[3:09:24.600 --> 3:09:25.920]  I want to take her out of here.
[3:09:25.920 --> 3:09:28.000]  And they said, no, sorry, ma'am.
[3:09:28.000 --> 3:09:35.480]  They were literally threatening me with CPS or the child protection services for medical
[3:09:35.480 --> 3:09:38.600]  neglect if I took her out of the hospital.
[3:09:38.600 --> 3:09:42.880]  Like the fact that she didn't really have a fever at all, but because they said she
[3:09:42.880 --> 3:09:47.440]  had some kind of marker scratch at the back of her throat, they had to run all these tests
[3:09:47.440 --> 3:09:48.440]  on her.
[3:09:48.440 --> 3:09:50.040]  They had her all wired up.
[3:09:50.040 --> 3:09:56.080]  She was some sick baby, took us up to stay overnight and everything.
[3:09:56.080 --> 3:10:03.160]  And the doctors then started wanting to pressure me to allow them to start her on high dose
[3:10:03.160 --> 3:10:12.800]  antibiotics and do a spinal tap on a newborn baby without any evidence that she was sick.
[3:10:12.800 --> 3:10:15.560]  They literally had no evidence she was sick, no fever, nothing.
[3:10:15.560 --> 3:10:17.280]  And they wanted to do a spinal tap on her.
[3:10:17.280 --> 3:10:19.760]  I kept saying, no, no way in hell.
[3:10:19.760 --> 3:10:21.760]  We are not doing a spinal tap on a newborn baby.
[3:10:21.760 --> 3:10:27.160]  I started threatening them legally that I would sue them, that you are not allowed.
[3:10:27.160 --> 3:10:31.480]  This is where I draw the line and this is where I threaten you legally that you are
[3:10:31.480 --> 3:10:35.000]  not going to do a spinal tap on my newborn baby.
[3:10:35.000 --> 3:10:40.920]  One of the doctors said to me, you know, if it were my baby, I would want them to have
[3:10:40.920 --> 3:10:42.160]  a spinal tap.
[3:10:42.160 --> 3:10:45.320]  I would want them to immediately be put on high dose antibiotics.
[3:10:45.320 --> 3:10:51.080]  I said, really, even when your baby is perfectly healthy and doesn't have a fever at all, they
[3:10:51.080 --> 3:10:52.800]  said, well, you don't know that.
[3:10:52.800 --> 3:10:56.440]  And mind you, the tests they took the night before had already come back to show that
[3:10:56.440 --> 3:11:00.480]  the mark in the back of her throat came back negative for anything.
[3:11:00.480 --> 3:11:04.160]  No herpes, no crazy viruses or any illnesses.
[3:11:04.160 --> 3:11:05.440]  It came back negative.
[3:11:05.440 --> 3:11:09.880]  So even with a negative test, they wanted me to do a spinal tap on my baby.
[3:11:09.880 --> 3:11:16.000]  I actually got into a long debate with one of the doctors who just, he wanted to go at
[3:11:16.000 --> 3:11:21.040]  me with, you know, vaccines and he had all the arguments, all the things to say.
[3:11:21.040 --> 3:11:23.600]  And I was just like, no, I have my reasons.
[3:11:23.600 --> 3:11:29.480]  I know for a fact and plus, you know, we have a thing in my family where babies get
[3:11:29.480 --> 3:11:34.360]  febrile seizures and I didn't want to risk anything going on with my baby.
[3:11:34.360 --> 3:11:38.760]  You know, I said, when you can show me on those inserts that it doesn't say risk of
[3:11:38.760 --> 3:11:43.720]  death, risk of autism, risk of all of these autoimmune diseases, when you can show me
[3:11:43.720 --> 3:11:45.520]  those vaccine inserts, don't say that.
[3:11:45.520 --> 3:11:46.520]  Well, I mean, that's the thing.
[3:11:46.520 --> 3:11:47.520]  Then we can talk.
[3:11:47.520 --> 3:11:48.520]  I mean, I've got $3 in the sun.
[3:11:48.520 --> 3:11:50.560]  None of them are tested for safety.
[3:11:50.560 --> 3:11:52.880]  They have secret liability protection.
[3:11:52.880 --> 3:11:56.120]  Now it's hundreds of shots they want to give and they know what they're doing.
[3:11:56.120 --> 3:11:57.880]  This is on purpose, people.
[3:11:57.880 --> 3:11:59.880]  We're not against science.
[3:11:59.880 --> 3:12:00.880]  We're not even against vaccines itself.
[3:12:00.880 --> 3:12:03.400]  In my view, it's that they're not giving us quality vaccines.
[3:12:03.400 --> 3:12:05.840]  They've got contaminants and it's part of a larger agenda.
[3:12:05.840 --> 3:12:10.000]  And these sweet little babies, my children are all in the top 99 percentile everything
[3:12:10.000 --> 3:12:11.520]  just like this baby is.
[3:12:11.520 --> 3:12:16.320]  And the doctors will tell you, no, we notice the difference with unvaccinated, vaccinated.
[3:12:16.320 --> 3:12:17.320]  It's a fact.
[3:12:17.320 --> 3:12:21.120]  But regardless, it's like a public health issue or like Yelp or reviews.
[3:12:21.120 --> 3:12:25.400]  They're trying to say mothers and fathers and people or nurses can't have their views
[3:12:25.400 --> 3:12:28.520]  that vaccines have caused damage or they've been hurt by vaccines.
[3:12:28.520 --> 3:12:31.600]  So they're trying to say that you as a consumer don't have a right to say you were hurt by
[3:12:31.600 --> 3:12:36.280]  a product that Big Pharma has that has liability protection with the whole history of Big Pharma
[3:12:36.280 --> 3:12:42.520]  and Bayer with HIV and the shots and the OxyCotton company knowing it would kill people.
[3:12:42.520 --> 3:12:43.520]  I mean, really?
[3:12:43.520 --> 3:12:47.880]  We're going to just trust these people that this history of secret experimentation, I
[3:12:47.880 --> 3:12:50.920]  really commend you guys for your courage and other parents stand together.
[3:12:50.920 --> 3:12:51.920]  God bless you.
[3:12:51.920 --> 3:12:53.000]  Well, thank you.
[3:12:53.000 --> 3:12:57.440]  And you know, that's why I told this doctor, I said, hey, you can't tell me there's not
[3:12:57.440 --> 3:13:01.760]  a possibility that this is going to injure my baby, these vaccines.
[3:13:01.760 --> 3:13:05.320]  And are you willing to be liable if my child is injured?
[3:13:05.320 --> 3:13:07.480]  Am I going to be able to sue you and come after you?
[3:13:07.480 --> 3:13:08.800]  Are you going to hold liability?
[3:13:08.800 --> 3:13:11.360]  The doctor didn't want to hear about that.
[3:13:11.360 --> 3:13:15.080]  And the other thing is he wanted to talk about herd immunity.
[3:13:15.080 --> 3:13:16.760]  You seem to care more about herd immunity.
[3:13:16.760 --> 3:13:17.960]  Oh, yeah, this happens.
[3:13:17.960 --> 3:13:18.960]  Some kids get hurt.
[3:13:18.960 --> 3:13:21.800]  But herd immunity is what we need.
[3:13:21.800 --> 3:13:23.760]  We need to protect the herd.
[3:13:23.760 --> 3:13:27.600]  One problem, doctor, my baby is not chattel.
[3:13:27.600 --> 3:13:32.040]  So when you say herd immunity to me, it falls on deaf ears.
[3:13:32.040 --> 3:13:37.200]  That night, an older doctor who was much older than all these other doctors, these doctors
[3:13:37.200 --> 3:13:38.200]  were younger.
[3:13:38.200 --> 3:13:40.040]  This guy was an old timer.
[3:13:40.040 --> 3:13:45.160]  He took one look at her and he said, what is this baby doing here?
[3:13:45.160 --> 3:13:46.400]  Why is this baby here?
[3:13:46.400 --> 3:13:48.160]  This baby is perfectly healthy.
[3:13:48.160 --> 3:13:51.760]  No fever, nothing like, he's like, I would have discharged her the minute we took
[3:13:51.760 --> 3:13:55.320]  her feet, her temperature and realized that she didn't have a fever.
[3:13:55.320 --> 3:13:57.720]  He's like, what is going on here?
[3:13:57.720 --> 3:13:59.360]  This is ridiculous.
[3:13:59.360 --> 3:14:03.080]  He couldn't believe when I told them that the other doctors wanted to do a spinal tap.
[3:14:03.080 --> 3:14:05.120]  He thought it was ludicrous.
[3:14:05.120 --> 3:14:08.680]  And now it is a standard procedure.
[3:14:08.680 --> 3:14:09.680]  Look this up.
[3:14:09.680 --> 3:14:15.400]  It's a standard procedure if a baby under three months old goes to the ER with even the parents
[3:14:15.400 --> 3:14:20.560]  thinking the baby had a fever of 100.3 and above.
[3:14:20.560 --> 3:14:25.800]  It's now standard for them to recommend spinal taps.
[3:14:25.800 --> 3:14:27.800]  This is insane.
[3:14:27.800 --> 3:14:32.960]  Finally, when it all came to a head and the doctors said she's perfectly healthy after
[3:14:32.960 --> 3:14:39.560]  all the tests we've given her, the only thing they could think of for why she had this cut
[3:14:39.560 --> 3:14:45.320]  or abrasion or sore at the back of her throat was probably from the suctioning.
[3:14:45.320 --> 3:14:50.120]  When she was born, the nurses might have been a little too violent suctioning the baby out
[3:14:50.120 --> 3:14:55.840]  and that was because they forced me to have a C-section because they said they literally
[3:14:55.840 --> 3:15:00.120]  would not let me try to have a V-back because my first son was a C-section.
[3:15:00.120 --> 3:15:02.720]  The hospital had a board of doctors.
[3:15:02.720 --> 3:15:06.520]  They said you had to get past this board of doctors and the doctors got to choose whether
[3:15:06.520 --> 3:15:09.880]  or not you could try to give birth naturally or C-section.
[3:15:09.880 --> 3:15:14.440]  And they said, nope, sorry, we're not even going to let you try to have a regular birth.
[3:15:14.440 --> 3:15:15.920]  C-section it is.
[3:15:15.920 --> 3:15:20.520]  So if my baby wasn't born with a C-section and maybe if they weren't so violent jabbing
[3:15:20.520 --> 3:15:25.840]  her with their suction device, she wouldn't have even ever had that sore on the back of
[3:15:25.840 --> 3:15:26.840]  her throat.
[3:15:26.840 --> 3:15:31.400]  So they created the problem that they then freaked out about in the first place.
[3:15:31.400 --> 3:15:33.560]  Just trust your intuition.
[3:15:33.560 --> 3:15:34.760]  It's your baby.
[3:15:34.760 --> 3:15:40.600]  You know whether or not your baby's really sick and really needing certain medical intervention.
[3:15:40.600 --> 3:15:45.280]  If I would have just trusted my own intuition when I looked at my baby and said, well,
[3:15:45.280 --> 3:15:50.160]  my baby looks perfectly healthy to me, she probably wouldn't have had to go through that
[3:15:50.160 --> 3:15:52.360]  traumatic experience of being.
[3:15:52.360 --> 3:15:54.320]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:15:54.320 --> 3:15:58.240]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:15:58.240 --> 3:15:59.800]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:15:59.800 --> 3:16:02.760]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:16:02.760 --> 3:16:06.040]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[3:16:06.040 --> 3:16:08.280]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[3:16:08.280 --> 3:16:09.600]  I can help you too.
[3:16:09.600 --> 3:16:12.600]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[3:16:14.840 --> 3:16:22.720]  Call 834 no tax or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:16:22.720 --> 3:16:28.120]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[3:16:28.120 --> 3:16:29.120]  the world.
[3:16:29.120 --> 3:16:32.120]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[3:16:32.120 --> 3:16:38.080]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[3:16:38.080 --> 3:16:41.880]  Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire.
[3:16:41.880 --> 3:16:43.120]  Was there ever a vote?
[3:16:43.120 --> 3:16:44.440]  Who do we fight for?
[3:16:44.440 --> 3:16:51.000]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunn, available
[3:16:51.000 --> 3:16:52.240]  at Amazon Books.
[3:16:52.240 --> 3:16:56.120]  Okay, so a watch is good and some jewelry, better grab some flowers too.
[3:16:56.120 --> 3:16:57.120]  Hey, whatcha doing?
[3:16:57.120 --> 3:16:58.120]  Mother's Day, remember?
[3:16:58.120 --> 3:16:59.120]  Oh yeah.

[3:19:50.780 --> 3:20:18.340]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:20:18.340 --> 3:20:27.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host, Will Johnson.
[3:20:27.180 --> 3:20:30.860]  Welcome to the last hour of the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:30.860 --> 3:20:32.900]  My name is Will Johnson.
[3:20:32.900 --> 3:20:34.820]  It's an honor to be here once again.
[3:20:34.820 --> 3:20:42.060]  We have a lot to talk about and the last few minutes in this hour.
[3:20:42.060 --> 3:20:46.500]  Abortion is the hot topic everywhere and so is censorship.
[3:20:46.500 --> 3:20:49.420]  First I want to talk about censorship.
[3:20:49.420 --> 3:20:53.860]  Censorship that's going across America is nothing different than when Nazi Germany
[3:20:53.860 --> 3:20:56.860]  was burning books in the day.
[3:20:56.860 --> 3:21:06.380]  Today you have Facebook creating this whole social media platform and Google with YouTube
[3:21:06.380 --> 3:21:07.380]  and Twitter.
[3:21:07.380 --> 3:21:10.100]  It is the public square.
[3:21:10.100 --> 3:21:16.460]  It's the public square and now you put your information out there and they delete it.
[3:21:16.460 --> 3:21:19.900]  It's digital book burning.
[3:21:19.900 --> 3:21:26.820]  Alex Jones has been removed from all of these platforms and they're having people terrified
[3:21:26.820 --> 3:21:30.940]  of even saying his name.
[3:21:30.940 --> 3:21:33.700]  So this is another sense of control.
[3:21:33.700 --> 3:21:34.980]  They're controlling everyone.
[3:21:34.980 --> 3:21:39.020]  They want to control what everything is being said, everything that's being shared.
[3:21:39.020 --> 3:21:42.660]  They do not want you to say Alex Jones.
[3:21:42.660 --> 3:21:48.020]  When they first started censoring Alex Jones, everyone was saying hashtag Alex Jones, hashtag
[3:21:48.020 --> 3:21:51.420]  Infowars, hashtag free Alex Jones.
[3:21:51.420 --> 3:21:52.860]  That too was taking place.
[3:21:52.860 --> 3:21:56.020]  Then it was like, okay, too many people are still doing this.
[3:21:56.020 --> 3:22:03.260]  So they came up with a way to terrify people in saying the name Alex Jones because they
[3:22:03.260 --> 3:22:05.020]  knew they couldn't stop it.
[3:22:05.020 --> 3:22:07.580]  They were not able to stop it.
[3:22:07.580 --> 3:22:10.220]  So why are they trying to do this censorship now?
[3:22:10.220 --> 3:22:11.860]  Well, it's obvious.
[3:22:11.860 --> 3:22:13.220]  2020 is coming.
[3:22:13.220 --> 3:22:20.340]  We have President Trump coming up for election in 2020 and they know, even Green said that
[3:22:20.340 --> 3:22:26.180]  if we do not impeach him, he's going to be president in 2020.
[3:22:26.180 --> 3:22:29.140]  So how did the censorship start off, right?
[3:22:29.140 --> 3:22:30.660]  Really think about it.
[3:22:30.660 --> 3:22:35.860]  For me, now, you know, they've been censoring people from, probably from the beginning,
[3:22:35.860 --> 3:22:39.860]  but it really started picking up after the 2016 election.
[3:22:39.860 --> 3:22:47.220]  Then President Trump beat Hillary Rodney Clinton outright and it wasn't to help other Russians.
[3:22:47.220 --> 3:22:49.420]  It was not to help other Russians.
[3:22:49.420 --> 3:22:54.700]  It was straight up the American people that voted for President Trump, not the Russians.
[3:22:54.700 --> 3:22:59.460]  You even had Democrats vote for President Trump because they didn't like what Hillary
[3:22:59.460 --> 3:23:02.140]  Clinton did to Bernie Sanders.
[3:23:02.140 --> 3:23:09.220]  So to talk about the digital book burning, see, you take your life story and you put
[3:23:09.220 --> 3:23:11.060]  it out there.
[3:23:11.060 --> 3:23:18.260]  You put your life story on social media and year after year, you put pictures, you put
[3:23:18.260 --> 3:23:23.300]  comments and then they just come along and they delete it.
[3:23:23.300 --> 3:23:25.860]  They burn your digital book.
[3:23:25.860 --> 3:23:26.860]  Why?
[3:23:26.860 --> 3:23:28.500]  Because you're saying something you don't like, right?
[3:23:28.500 --> 3:23:32.100]  Oh, you hurt my feelings.
[3:23:32.100 --> 3:23:36.900]  So basically they wanted to delete people because of your political views, not because
[3:23:36.900 --> 3:23:41.860]  you've gone out and murdered someone, not because you've gone out and robbed a bank,
[3:23:41.860 --> 3:23:46.980]  not because you've gone out and advocated for people to be violent towards other people,
[3:23:46.980 --> 3:23:51.020]  not because you see people on the street wearing a Trump hat and you decide to hit them.
[3:23:51.020 --> 3:23:53.740]  No, you're not getting banned for that.
[3:23:53.740 --> 3:23:58.180]  You're getting banned because you're not saying what they want you to say.
[3:23:58.180 --> 3:24:01.140]  You get banned because you go against the grain.
[3:24:01.140 --> 3:24:04.180]  You get banned because you are a believer in Christ.
[3:24:04.180 --> 3:24:09.860]  You get banned because you support organizations like Infowars.com.
[3:24:09.860 --> 3:24:17.940]  See, when you support someone like Infowars.com, Alex Jones, it runs through their veins and
[3:24:17.940 --> 3:24:21.260]  it just boils.
[3:24:21.260 --> 3:24:24.860]  Look how they act when you support President Trump.
[3:24:24.860 --> 3:24:29.100]  Right now they have this whole programming thing telling everybody that President Trump
[3:24:29.100 --> 3:24:30.100]  is angry.
[3:24:30.100 --> 3:24:36.420]  Well, President Trump is angry, well, he should be angry because they're not doing their job.
[3:24:36.420 --> 3:24:38.060]  He is the boss, right?
[3:24:38.060 --> 3:24:40.260]  He's supposed to be the boss.
[3:24:40.260 --> 3:24:45.500]  The left, these Democrats, they're not doing their job and they're saying he's angry.
[3:24:45.500 --> 3:24:49.820]  Even President Trump is now saying that if you're having issues with social media, he
[3:24:49.820 --> 3:24:56.900]  has created a location for people to come and voice their grievances, to voice how they
[3:24:56.900 --> 3:25:04.020]  are being disenfranchised by the liberal media outlets with the social media.
[3:25:04.020 --> 3:25:08.460]  You know, the President of the United States, the last thing he should have to do is come
[3:25:08.460 --> 3:25:11.860]  out and fight for freedoms.
[3:25:11.860 --> 3:25:14.740]  You shouldn't have to do that.
[3:25:14.740 --> 3:25:18.460]  He shouldn't have to come out and say, you know what, I have to create this platform
[3:25:18.460 --> 3:25:23.220]  so you can keep your freedom of speech, you know, the First Amendment.
[3:25:23.220 --> 3:25:29.180]  The thing that the Democrats are supposed to abide by, you know, the Constitution.
[3:25:29.180 --> 3:25:31.500]  The thing that they created years ago.
[3:25:31.500 --> 3:25:35.260]  But you know what, the Democrats say the Constitution is out of date.
[3:25:35.260 --> 3:25:40.540]  See that's why you have groups like CNN and MSNBC working with these liberal media outlets
[3:25:40.540 --> 3:25:42.860]  censoring conservatives.
[3:25:42.860 --> 3:25:44.740]  It wasn't Russia.
[3:25:44.740 --> 3:25:46.860]  There was no Russia collusion.
[3:25:46.860 --> 3:25:49.980]  There was no obstruction.
[3:25:49.980 --> 3:25:55.620]  And the censorship is still taking place because they know it was Americans.
[3:25:55.620 --> 3:26:01.180]  It was God believing Americans that voted for President Trump.
[3:26:01.180 --> 3:26:02.940]  And that's the part they don't like.
[3:26:02.940 --> 3:26:04.700]  So how do we stop that?
[3:26:04.700 --> 3:26:08.780]  I mean, I don't know if you saw it, but right after the 2016 election, Google, a panel of
[3:26:08.780 --> 3:26:15.100]  people at Google got up on this panel and they sit there and had a discussion on how
[3:26:15.100 --> 3:26:21.060]  we can prevent an election from happening the way it did in 2016.
[3:26:21.060 --> 3:26:27.740]  Why in the world would Google spend the time and effort on trying to change the outcome
[3:26:27.740 --> 3:26:28.860]  of the election?
[3:26:28.860 --> 3:26:34.060]  Why would they try to convince people not to vote for the best candidate?
[3:26:34.060 --> 3:26:36.820]  And President Trump was the best candidate.
[3:26:36.820 --> 3:26:41.260]  Now, he does have a foot in Twitter mouth, but you know what, I like his Twitter.
[3:26:41.260 --> 3:26:46.380]  I have foot in Twitter mouth every now and then too, because I say what's on my mind.
[3:26:46.380 --> 3:26:48.460]  And so you're not supposed to do that.
[3:26:48.460 --> 3:26:49.780]  You're not supposed to say what's on your mind.
[3:26:49.780 --> 3:26:52.460]  You're supposed to go along with the liberal left.
[3:26:52.460 --> 3:26:56.940]  You're supposed to go along with the ideas that they hate America.
[3:26:56.940 --> 3:26:58.900]  America's bad.
[3:26:58.900 --> 3:26:59.900]  America's bad.
[3:26:59.900 --> 3:27:01.460]  Don't like America.
[3:27:01.460 --> 3:27:04.220]  If you like America, then there's a problem with you.
[3:27:04.220 --> 3:27:08.060]  If you like conservatives and you want to support President Trump, you want to support
[3:27:08.060 --> 3:27:11.980]  organizations like InfaWars and something's wrong with you, you're bad.
[3:27:11.980 --> 3:27:16.380]  Oh, and don't be right and support President Trump or InfaWars.
[3:27:16.380 --> 3:27:23.300]  Oh my God, you're just automatically a neo-Nazi right supremacist racist simply because you
[3:27:23.300 --> 3:27:25.260]  were born right.
[3:27:25.260 --> 3:27:27.660]  Do you not see the problem in that?
[3:27:27.660 --> 3:27:28.740]  I'm a black male.
[3:27:28.740 --> 3:27:32.460]  I support InfaWars.com because I support free speech.
[3:27:32.460 --> 3:27:34.740]  I support it.
[3:27:34.740 --> 3:27:41.340]  100%, you don't have to like it, but I'm going to continue supporting InfaWars.
[3:27:41.340 --> 3:27:44.860]  I'm going to continue supporting the President of the United States.
[3:27:44.860 --> 3:27:50.140]  I'm going to, and if I have my freedoms and you say that's your four freedoms, then you
[3:27:50.140 --> 3:27:54.140]  should join me in supporting InfaWars.com.
[3:27:54.140 --> 3:27:59.700]  And one way you can do that support is by going to InfaWarsStore.com.
[3:27:59.700 --> 3:28:02.180]  Get the supplements.
[3:28:02.180 --> 3:28:04.700]  Right now they have an awesome deal.
[3:28:04.700 --> 3:28:07.300]  There's an eight pack power stack.
[3:28:07.300 --> 3:28:08.300]  It is unbelievable.
[3:28:08.300 --> 3:28:10.260]  And you know, it makes complete sense.
[3:28:10.260 --> 3:28:14.500]  You get the packet, you put it in your pocket, you go on your day when you're having breakfast
[3:28:14.500 --> 3:28:20.860]  and you're having lunch, go ahead and take it, get the energy, get what your body needs.
[3:28:20.860 --> 3:28:24.740]  I saw this deal and I'm like, man, I've got to order it today.
[3:28:24.740 --> 3:28:27.460]  I have to order it today.
[3:28:27.460 --> 3:28:29.580]  Go to InfaWarsStore.com.

[3:31:58.940 --> 3:32:04.180]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans that almost all of them said, we used to love you on
[3:32:04.180 --> 3:32:05.180]  air.
[3:32:05.180 --> 3:32:08.180]  It was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.

[3:32:15.860 --> 3:32:16.860]  We have our own articles.
[3:32:16.860 --> 3:32:17.860]  We're trying to destroy us.
[3:32:17.860 --> 3:32:21.660]  But thanks to you and others having us on, infowarstore is still chatting along.
[3:32:21.660 --> 3:32:23.860]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news today.
[3:32:23.860 --> 3:32:39.780]  I'm at infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com and we knew this censorship was coming forever.
[3:32:39.780 --> 3:32:43.580]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams and it's all free to air.
[3:32:43.580 --> 3:32:44.580]  Anybody can use it.

[3:32:48.580 --> 3:32:49.580]  That's where they find it.
[3:32:49.580 --> 3:32:57.300]  You know, there's what things go websites and you just go there.
[3:32:57.300 --> 3:33:15.580]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:15.580 --> 3:33:30.260]  All right, welcome back, welcome back.
[3:33:30.260 --> 3:33:35.380]  So in the last segment, we're talking about censorship, you know, free speech is going
[3:33:35.380 --> 3:33:36.940]  away.
[3:33:36.940 --> 3:33:41.300]  I can talk about it all day long because it's affecting all of us.
[3:33:41.300 --> 3:33:45.580]  And a lot of us, like I was saying, don't even recognize it's happening to us.
[3:33:45.580 --> 3:33:47.780]  It's like we're watching it from a distance.
[3:33:47.780 --> 3:33:50.380]  Oh, look what's happening to those people over there.
[3:33:50.380 --> 3:33:51.780]  Look what's happening.
[3:33:51.780 --> 3:33:57.420]  I'm glad it's not happening to me when it is happening to all of us.
[3:33:57.420 --> 3:34:00.660]  You know, what I don't understand is you have these people on the left.
[3:34:00.660 --> 3:34:07.220]  They say they're so tolerant and inclusive and they're all about love, love, love.
[3:34:07.220 --> 3:34:09.940]  But then they scream, shut them down.
[3:34:09.940 --> 3:34:11.580]  I don't like what they're saying.
[3:34:11.580 --> 3:34:12.700]  They're going to get me.
[3:34:12.700 --> 3:34:13.700]  I hate them.
[3:34:13.700 --> 3:34:14.700]  I hate them.
[3:34:14.700 --> 3:34:15.700]  Shut them down.
[3:34:15.700 --> 3:34:16.700]  Shut them down.
[3:34:16.700 --> 3:34:20.500]  They're the fascist because I don't like what they're saying.
[3:34:20.500 --> 3:34:25.860]  Really, really, what happened to be an inclusive, right?
[3:34:25.860 --> 3:34:30.220]  They, they, I, when they, when they do that, they're just lying.
[3:34:30.220 --> 3:34:34.180]  It is all nothing but lies when they do that.
[3:34:34.180 --> 3:34:36.260]  And we're supposed to believe it.
[3:34:36.260 --> 3:34:43.020]  Seriously, you would think that the mainstream media, as soon as they see that the free press,
[3:34:43.020 --> 3:34:47.980]  whoever it may be, start, you know, when they're getting censored, getting shut down, they
[3:34:47.980 --> 3:34:51.860]  should be, it should be alarm bells for the, for these major ones.
[3:34:51.860 --> 3:34:54.740]  Now you have Tucker, he talked about it.
[3:34:54.740 --> 3:34:58.940]  He has talked about it quite often.
[3:34:58.940 --> 3:35:03.380]  But you don't see, you know, CNN talk about it because they're happy when it happens or
[3:35:03.380 --> 3:35:09.180]  MSNBC or the rest of the liberal media outlets, they're happy when it happens because it's
[3:35:09.180 --> 3:35:10.180]  what they want.
[3:35:10.180 --> 3:35:15.380]  And I think part of the reason why they're happy about it is because their ratings are
[3:35:15.380 --> 3:35:23.860]  so low, they want to remove other media outlets that's getting better ratings than them.
[3:35:23.860 --> 3:35:29.420]  Even on, even on Facebook, I can put a video on Facebook and get better ratings than CNN
[3:35:29.420 --> 3:35:30.820]  does on Facebook.
[3:35:30.820 --> 3:35:31.820]  Oh.
[3:35:31.820 --> 3:35:36.340]  So we got a censor, Will Johnson, he's becoming a problem.
[3:35:36.340 --> 3:35:38.900]  He's not saying what we want.
[3:35:38.900 --> 3:35:42.340]  So they have to go all out and attack conservatives.
[3:35:42.340 --> 3:35:43.340]  All right.
[3:35:43.340 --> 3:35:46.500]  Let me change it up a little bit here.
[3:35:46.500 --> 3:35:51.500]  Alex Jones was talking about it earlier and he talked about, I won't talk about abortion
[3:35:51.500 --> 3:35:55.780]  that's going on in the country and, you know, even around the world.
[3:35:55.780 --> 3:36:01.100]  If you go and even do, and I was actually surprised that Google even had this, if you
[3:36:01.100 --> 3:36:08.220]  go out and Google how many abortions throughout the year, right, you just Google it and Google.
[3:36:08.220 --> 3:36:09.220]  Yeah.
[3:36:09.220 --> 3:36:10.220]  I was surprised.
[3:36:10.220 --> 3:36:21.860]  It said between 40, just Google abortions in a year and it showed between 40 and 50 million
[3:36:21.860 --> 3:36:28.860]  babies murdered through abortion on the planet every year.
[3:36:28.860 --> 3:36:31.260]  This is remarkable.
[3:36:31.260 --> 3:36:32.380]  It's insane.
[3:36:32.380 --> 3:36:39.980]  That, and they say it comes out to about 125,000 babies being murdered a day.
[3:36:39.980 --> 3:36:44.780]  And then you have the laughter celebrating it and calling it good women's health care.
[3:36:44.780 --> 3:36:46.780]  Oh, it's great.
[3:36:46.780 --> 3:36:53.620]  It is good women's health care to kill these unborn children.
[3:36:53.620 --> 3:37:00.700]  And specifically, they call it good health care when it targets black babies and you
[3:37:00.700 --> 3:37:01.700]  know what?
[3:37:01.700 --> 3:37:05.620]  And then I started thinking about it because, you know, in Alabama, they had the abortion
[3:37:05.620 --> 3:37:12.820]  pop up and in about Alabama, there was a, the governor to my understanding as a woman,
[3:37:12.820 --> 3:37:18.420]  she did, she signed the bill for the, you know, and everyone's talking about it in Alabama.
[3:37:18.420 --> 3:37:22.780]  And to my understanding, a woman came up with the bill for it in Alabama.
[3:37:22.780 --> 3:37:27.620]  And then the liberal media don't want to pay attention to the women that's fighting to
[3:37:27.620 --> 3:37:29.220]  stop abortion.
[3:37:29.220 --> 3:37:36.180]  They keyed in on the 25 men that are Republicans that supported it.
[3:37:36.180 --> 3:37:38.020]  That's what they, that's what they came in on.
[3:37:38.020 --> 3:37:42.700]  That's what they looked at the 25 white men and they were complaining because there were
[3:37:42.700 --> 3:37:44.780]  white men doing this.
[3:37:44.780 --> 3:37:46.660]  Well, guess what?
[3:37:46.660 --> 3:37:52.420]  Just like back in the day, Republicans, white Republicans were helping black people for
[3:37:52.420 --> 3:37:54.460]  their freedoms and their lives.
[3:37:54.460 --> 3:37:57.100]  Today, we still have the same thing.
[3:37:57.100 --> 3:38:01.820]  And then you have the left trying to say that white people are bad, but yet here it is.
[3:38:01.820 --> 3:38:04.580]  I got it on the screen for viewers that don't see it.
[3:38:04.580 --> 3:38:13.500]  There's 25 white men, Republicans, every last one of them are Republicans and they are fighting
[3:38:13.500 --> 3:38:17.860]  for black babies to have a life.
[3:38:17.860 --> 3:38:22.980]  And you have the Democrats upset with these white men for trying to help black babies
[3:38:22.980 --> 3:38:25.620]  have a life.
[3:38:25.620 --> 3:38:26.860]  Do you hear that?
[3:38:26.860 --> 3:38:28.420]  Do you hear what I'm saying?
[3:38:28.420 --> 3:38:34.660]  It is white men, white people fighting for black lives.
[3:38:34.660 --> 3:38:37.980]  It is not black people fighting for black lives.
[3:38:37.980 --> 3:38:43.460]  Black lives only matter when there's a white person or a cop, a police officer involved.
[3:38:43.460 --> 3:38:47.980]  That's the only time black lives matter to black people.
[3:38:47.980 --> 3:38:50.820]  Oh yeah, I'm black and I'm not supposed to be saying that.
[3:38:50.820 --> 3:38:51.820]  Am I?
[3:38:51.820 --> 3:38:54.140]  Well, it's the truth.
[3:38:54.140 --> 3:38:56.060]  It's the truth.
[3:38:56.060 --> 3:39:00.740]  Why do you have more white Republicans fighting for black lives than you do Democrats?
[3:39:00.740 --> 3:39:01.740]  Why?
[3:39:01.740 --> 3:39:06.420]  Because the Democrats are trying to do genocide against black people and they're doing it
[3:39:06.420 --> 3:39:12.780]  real sly like, real slick like, like little snakes just slivering through the grass.
[3:39:12.780 --> 3:39:13.780]  That's all they are.
[3:39:13.780 --> 3:39:19.860]  They're snakes and they want to consume everything that is good.
[3:39:19.860 --> 3:39:23.620]  They want to consume everything and they want to kill everything.
[3:39:23.620 --> 3:39:26.460]  Margaret Sanger to be an example.
[3:39:26.460 --> 3:39:31.900]  I was looking at Margaret Sanger and one of the things I doubt, I took a copy of some
[3:39:31.900 --> 3:39:36.580]  of the statements that she has out there and if you go to Google and type it in, you're
[3:39:36.580 --> 3:39:38.500]  not going to get it.
[3:39:38.500 --> 3:39:39.500]  You're not going to get it.
[3:39:39.500 --> 3:39:44.700]  I can find it on Google, so I had to go to where because it's not Google Bing.
[3:39:44.700 --> 3:39:47.380]  I had to go to Bing to find this.
[3:39:47.380 --> 3:39:53.380]  So I went over to Bing and right here it says, this is Margaret Sanger, mind you, okay?
[3:39:53.380 --> 3:39:54.380]  This is Margaret Sanger.
[3:39:54.380 --> 3:40:08.140]  It says, we do not want word to get out that we want to exterminate the Negro population.
[3:40:08.140 --> 3:40:10.900]  That's her words.
[3:40:10.900 --> 3:40:18.420]  And even today, and even today, they don't want people to know that the whole agenda
[3:40:18.420 --> 3:40:25.900]  of Planned Parenthood, oh, hood, white hood, and they support it.
[3:40:25.900 --> 3:40:34.180]  My God, Planned Parenthood and you have black people and Democrats supporting it and it's
[3:40:34.180 --> 3:40:45.080]  genocide against black people, Planned Parenthood and why do they do it?
[3:40:45.080 --> 3:40:50.860]  Because black people have been convinced, oh, it's good healthcare if you kill this unborn
[3:40:50.860 --> 3:40:51.860]  child.
[3:40:51.860 --> 3:40:57.540]  It is good healthcare for black women to kill them, to kill them.
[3:40:57.540 --> 3:41:05.460]  I'll send this surf on the web and find another picture where it showed, this was actually
[3:41:05.460 --> 3:41:08.220]  a report on Infowars.com.
[3:41:08.220 --> 3:41:13.260]  This is how I came window of it the first time in Iowa where they talk about lawmakers
[3:41:13.260 --> 3:41:21.580]  offers amendment to seek to exempt black babies from abortion.
[3:41:21.580 --> 3:41:26.660]  They want to exempt black babies from abortion.
[3:41:26.660 --> 3:41:27.660]  And I was like, why?
[3:41:27.660 --> 3:41:28.660]  I don't understand.
[3:41:28.660 --> 3:41:35.500]  I'm like, really, they want to exempt black babies from abortion.
[3:41:35.500 --> 3:41:41.340]  And then I'm sitting there thinking, okay, so when they have abortion, they're saying,
[3:41:41.340 --> 3:41:48.180]  okay, white women, you don't have to get an abortion, Latinos, brown women, you don't
[3:41:48.180 --> 3:41:50.900]  have to get an abortion, please leave this up on the screen.
[3:41:50.900 --> 3:41:52.540]  You don't have to get an abortion.
[3:41:52.540 --> 3:42:00.260]  But then they have a picture of a black woman, they have a picture with a black woman on
[3:42:00.260 --> 3:42:10.100]  the screen holding a black baby saying like, oh, it's good if you would abort this baby
[3:42:10.100 --> 3:42:13.620]  as if it's good healthcare.
[3:42:13.620 --> 3:42:18.580]  I mean, is it just me or did anyone else pick up on that?
[3:42:18.580 --> 3:42:22.960]  All right, thank you.
[3:42:22.960 --> 3:42:28.900]  So to get back to what I was saying earlier, you have white people back in the day doing
[3:42:28.900 --> 3:42:31.780]  slavery where they wanted to help black people.
[3:42:31.780 --> 3:42:32.780]  It was white people.
[3:42:32.780 --> 3:42:37.540]  Today, you have white people in that same fight trying to help black people again.
[3:42:37.540 --> 3:42:39.020]  And guess who's trying to stop it?
[3:42:39.020 --> 3:42:44.220]  The common denominator, the demonic demon leftists.
[3:42:44.220 --> 3:42:47.060]  They do not want black people to exist.
[3:42:47.060 --> 3:42:53.060]  They want to exterminate, exterminate, exterminate, exterminate black people.
[3:42:53.060 --> 3:42:57.100]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't
[3:42:57.100 --> 3:42:58.100]  be there for my children someday.
[3:42:58.100 --> 3:43:00.220]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[3:43:00.220 --> 3:43:01.980]  Now I can be there for my children.
[3:43:01.980 --> 3:43:03.820]  Now I can make them strong.
[3:43:03.820 --> 3:43:05.420]  Now I can instruct them.
[3:43:05.420 --> 3:43:07.060]  Now I can teach them what I've learned.
[3:43:07.060 --> 3:43:08.060]  But not once I'm gone.
[3:43:08.060 --> 3:43:11.220]  You think of this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better
[3:43:11.220 --> 3:43:13.420]  getting rid of what you said and they were before.
[3:43:13.420 --> 3:43:18.140]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book
[3:43:18.140 --> 3:43:19.140]  burning, isn't it?
[3:43:19.140 --> 3:43:22.540]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[3:43:22.540 --> 3:43:26.820]  I can't be destroyed now as long as I realize I've done right and the longer the people
[3:43:26.820 --> 3:43:29.020]  know the truth and you can't be destroyed either.
[3:43:29.020 --> 3:43:34.340]  As long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for
[3:43:34.340 --> 3:43:38.340]  it, there is a magic that then takes place, the transcend space and time.
[3:43:38.340 --> 3:43:42.860]  When you commit, be a word of mouth or to pray for us or to spread our articles and videos.
[3:43:42.860 --> 3:43:48.500]  It overrides everything the enemy's doing, so please now commit to support InfoWars however
[3:43:48.500 --> 3:43:53.340]  you can and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[3:43:53.340 --> 3:44:00.060]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and known
[3:44:00.060 --> 3:44:05.340]  positive effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[3:44:05.340 --> 3:44:10.540]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated
[3:44:10.540 --> 3:44:13.420]  with and then it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[3:44:13.420 --> 3:44:17.180]  Well, thousands of years ago it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if
[3:44:17.180 --> 3:44:18.180]  they were sick.
[3:44:18.180 --> 3:44:22.100]  But then you add not just the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest
[3:44:22.100 --> 3:44:27.260]  quality bone broth out there, literally, then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have
[3:44:27.260 --> 3:44:31.380]  the turmeric, then you have the bee pollen, then you have the other key ingredients that
[3:44:31.380 --> 3:44:36.460]  are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.
[3:44:36.460 --> 3:44:41.300]  Our ultimate bone broth formula is amazing, it's 50% off right now at InfoWarsTour.com

[3:44:54.740 --> 3:44:59.220]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing, that what God gave us from other nature is
[3:44:59.220 --> 3:45:00.220]  incredible.
[3:45:00.220 --> 3:45:03.340]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world and the globalists
[3:45:03.340 --> 3:45:04.820]  are so upset.
[3:45:04.820 --> 3:45:10.460]  The problem is people forget to take them and that's why the whole industry has moved
[3:45:10.460 --> 3:45:14.020]  towards packets that you take in the morning and you take at night.
[3:45:14.020 --> 3:45:18.900]  So we looked at that, we made the very best AM and PM packets out there with an incredible

[3:45:52.860 --> 3:46:03.700]  the price.

[3:46:10.140 --> 3:46:16.420]  energy drinks and energy supplements but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic
[3:46:16.420 --> 3:46:20.700]  caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few
[3:46:20.700 --> 3:46:22.820]  hours and have terrible side effects.

[3:46:29.380 --> 3:46:32.260]  and beyond system in the world.

[3:46:56.700 --> 3:47:11.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:11.900 --> 3:47:19.460]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones
[3:47:19.460 --> 3:47:26.620]  Show and now your host, Will Johnson.
[3:47:26.620 --> 3:47:31.300]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, my name is Will Johnson.
[3:47:31.300 --> 3:47:39.820]  We were talking about abortion and how the left is destroying black lives.
[3:47:39.820 --> 3:47:46.620]  The left is destroying black lives, you know, black lives don't matter to the Democrats,
[3:47:46.620 --> 3:47:48.140]  they really don't.
[3:47:48.140 --> 3:47:54.180]  You know, they're encouraging black women specifically to abort their children.
[3:47:54.180 --> 3:47:59.620]  And I have one lady tell me that it's probably a good thing that black women abort their
[3:47:59.620 --> 3:48:04.420]  children because of all of the poverty and the ghettos that black children have to grow
[3:48:04.420 --> 3:48:10.300]  up in and if they abort their children, then they don't have to grow up in that situation.
[3:48:10.300 --> 3:48:15.820]  Oh, why not teach the black people to lift themselves up?
[3:48:15.820 --> 3:48:19.940]  Why not teach them to try to do better to get out of the projects?
[3:48:19.940 --> 3:48:21.740]  To get out of the ghetto?
[3:48:21.740 --> 3:48:24.940]  Why not teach black people that you can be someone?
[3:48:24.940 --> 3:48:27.940]  Why not teach black people to be better?
[3:48:27.940 --> 3:48:29.260]  Why not do that?
[3:48:29.260 --> 3:48:31.820]  Oh, but no, you can't do that.
[3:48:31.820 --> 3:48:39.060]  You have to tell black people that aborting is good healthcare.
[3:48:39.060 --> 3:48:42.780]  You have to tell women, oh, it is good for you to do it.
[3:48:42.780 --> 3:48:49.420]  It is positive thing for you to want to kill that baby that's growing in your room.
[3:48:49.420 --> 3:48:50.860]  That's what you want to do.
[3:48:50.860 --> 3:48:57.900]  They put billboards up to tell black women it is good healthcare for you to kill that
[3:48:57.900 --> 3:48:58.900]  baby.
[3:48:58.900 --> 3:49:01.900]  Does that make a liquor sense to you?
[3:49:01.900 --> 3:49:05.820]  Because it does not make a liquor sense to me.
[3:49:05.820 --> 3:49:07.260]  These people are insane.
[3:49:07.260 --> 3:49:10.220]  They're demonic demons.
[3:49:10.220 --> 3:49:13.180]  They're demons that's trying to destroy everything that is good.
[3:49:13.180 --> 3:49:15.860]  They want to destroy it with the family unit.
[3:49:15.860 --> 3:49:21.620]  See, in the projects or in the black community, they have already told and convinced many
[3:49:21.620 --> 3:49:24.740]  black women not to have a man in the household.
[3:49:24.740 --> 3:49:25.740]  Why?
[3:49:25.740 --> 3:49:29.060]  Because that means there will be a father there to help out the children.
[3:49:29.060 --> 3:49:30.660]  See, that's another thing.
[3:49:30.660 --> 3:49:38.020]  Why not convince women to have a man in the household to raise decent families?
[3:49:38.020 --> 3:49:39.700]  They don't want to do that.
[3:49:39.700 --> 3:49:41.940]  Because Satan has controlled of them.
[3:49:41.940 --> 3:49:48.220]  Satan has already taken over their minds to convince them that the family is bad.
[3:49:48.220 --> 3:49:51.460]  And then if you have white people come and telling you, oh, you know what?
[3:49:51.460 --> 3:49:52.460]  Be somebody.
[3:49:52.460 --> 3:49:54.420]  Pull yourself up.
[3:49:54.420 --> 3:49:55.420]  Be strong.
[3:49:55.420 --> 3:49:59.100]  Then they want to say white people are bad for telling you that.
[3:49:59.100 --> 3:50:05.740]  What kind of society do we live in when you can't have someone tell you encouraging words?
[3:50:05.740 --> 3:50:10.380]  What kind of society do we live in where if you say positive things about black people,
[3:50:10.380 --> 3:50:12.180]  you must be racist, right?
[3:50:12.180 --> 3:50:16.620]  And, but see, the Democrats, they want to say, act like they're doing positive things.
[3:50:16.620 --> 3:50:21.580]  But convincing these women to kill these babies is not convincing.
[3:50:21.580 --> 3:50:28.380]  It's not, it's not, it's not, it's not satisfying to me.
[3:50:28.380 --> 3:50:29.380]  It is not.
[3:50:29.380 --> 3:50:32.100]  I mean, I'm trying not to get angry when I'm thinking about it.
[3:50:32.100 --> 3:50:35.700]  When I'm thinking about the, the governor of Virginia, how he talking about take the baby
[3:50:35.700 --> 3:50:38.740]  and put it on the table.
[3:50:38.740 --> 3:50:40.300]  My God.
[3:50:40.300 --> 3:50:43.300]  Are we butchers?
[3:50:43.300 --> 3:50:47.220]  When did we become monsters like this?
[3:50:47.220 --> 3:50:48.220]  When did it be okay?
[3:50:48.220 --> 3:51:00.860]  When did it become okay to want to say killing is the next best thing when and why?
[3:51:00.860 --> 3:51:05.740]  You know, all of this goes right along with the whole censorship because they don't want
[3:51:05.740 --> 3:51:10.380]  people coming out saying that you're against killing of the unborn.
[3:51:10.380 --> 3:51:14.460]  Because you're saying all of a sudden you're taking away women's rights.
[3:51:14.460 --> 3:51:19.540]  You know, you're taking away the women's right of saying that I can decide if I want to abort
[3:51:19.540 --> 3:51:20.540]  this baby.
[3:51:20.540 --> 3:51:21.740]  You're taking my right away.
[3:51:21.740 --> 3:51:24.700]  Well, what about the rights of the father?
[3:51:24.700 --> 3:51:29.660]  What about the rights of the man that actually helped procreate that child?
[3:51:29.660 --> 3:51:32.540]  What about our rights?
[3:51:32.540 --> 3:51:37.380]  I have one lady tell me that you don't have any right to say anything about abortion or
[3:51:37.380 --> 3:51:41.420]  the other woman having abortion or the mother carrying the baby.
[3:51:41.420 --> 3:51:44.220]  You have no rights because you're a man.
[3:51:44.220 --> 3:51:48.220]  Well, what if the child is mine?
[3:51:48.220 --> 3:51:50.860]  Do I not have the right then?
[3:51:50.860 --> 3:51:52.700]  Do I not?
[3:51:52.700 --> 3:51:53.700]  What about my rights?
[3:51:53.700 --> 3:51:55.180]  What about my choice?
[3:51:55.180 --> 3:51:59.860]  Why are you taking my choice away?
[3:51:59.860 --> 3:52:02.360]  Why?
[3:52:02.360 --> 3:52:06.100]  And it all has everything to do with censorship because they want to take our voices away
[3:52:06.100 --> 3:52:08.980]  of voicing how we feel about it.
[3:52:08.980 --> 3:52:12.500]  As a man, I do not agree with it.
[3:52:12.500 --> 3:52:15.940]  It's my choice not to agree with it.
[3:52:15.940 --> 3:52:23.260]  So right now, if you go to Infowars.com, they have these posters that you can get to talk
[3:52:23.260 --> 3:52:25.460]  about free speech.
[3:52:25.460 --> 3:52:28.300]  I encourage everybody to go there.
[3:52:28.300 --> 3:52:32.700]  If the producers, please, if you would put it up on the screen right now, Infowars.com,
[3:52:32.700 --> 3:52:36.860]  where they can get these posters and they can print them out.
[3:52:36.860 --> 3:52:40.980]  And you can take these posters and you can put them on like telephone poles.
[3:52:40.980 --> 3:52:44.740]  Don't put them anywhere where someone's going to be like complaining about it, talking about
[3:52:44.740 --> 3:52:46.500]  your littering or something like that.
[3:52:46.500 --> 3:52:51.180]  Put them where other posters will, where you can see them and you know, and there's a lot
[3:52:51.180 --> 3:52:55.220]  of light poles that are made out of wood that you can put them on.
[3:52:55.220 --> 3:52:59.940]  Put them there because the censorship is going to stop us even from talking about abortion.
[3:52:59.940 --> 3:53:03.780]  The censorship is going to stop us from talking about keeping our freedoms.
[3:53:03.780 --> 3:53:08.460]  The censorship is going to stop us from having freedom of the press.
[3:53:08.460 --> 3:53:16.220]  The censorship is going to stop us from showing our support for President Trump come 2020.
[3:53:16.220 --> 3:53:20.380]  Do you not realize the sinister act of all of it?
[3:53:20.380 --> 3:53:21.740]  But think about it.
[3:53:21.740 --> 3:53:28.340]  If they are successful in shutting down our freedom of speech come 2020, we won't even
[3:53:28.340 --> 3:53:36.260]  be able to talk about how much we support President Trump in 2020.
[3:53:36.260 --> 3:53:39.860]  If you, and I did this the other day and you know, I didn't even look at it this morning.
[3:53:39.860 --> 3:53:45.020]  I went to Google and I went to first, if you go to Bing and maybe the producers will bring
[3:53:45.020 --> 3:53:46.020]  it up for me.
[3:53:46.020 --> 3:53:52.260]  Because it's not Google and type in US presidents and it's all sinister and it's like subliminal
[3:53:52.260 --> 3:53:56.460]  messages and it's like really small and settle to get people.
[3:53:56.460 --> 3:54:00.980]  If you go to Bing and type in US presidents, this was happening like yesterday.
[3:54:00.980 --> 3:54:03.940]  I looked at it and you can see the order.
[3:54:03.940 --> 3:54:07.260]  It shows President Trump in Obama, right?
[3:54:07.260 --> 3:54:09.540]  And someone in Bush and it shows it shows the order.
[3:54:09.540 --> 3:54:17.660]  Now, if you go to Google and type in the exact same thing as of yesterday, it had Obama's
[3:54:17.660 --> 3:54:20.740]  picture there before President Trump.
[3:54:20.740 --> 3:54:23.860]  And I'm thinking why would they do that?
[3:54:23.860 --> 3:54:29.100]  What is the reasoning for doing that?
[3:54:29.100 --> 3:54:34.740]  And they put Obama's face before President Trump is so disrespectful.
[3:54:34.740 --> 3:54:40.620]  But then if you look a little bit closer, then they put Kennedy and they put Bushes and they
[3:54:40.620 --> 3:54:44.140]  separate all of them just a little bit to make it look like it's just old.
[3:54:44.140 --> 3:54:45.900]  This is just how it is.
[3:54:45.900 --> 3:54:47.580]  No, it's not.
[3:54:47.580 --> 3:54:52.700]  If that was the case, why not put Obama where you can't even see him on the screen?
[3:54:52.700 --> 3:54:55.460]  See they have Obama on their first.
[3:54:55.460 --> 3:55:01.260]  They want people when you just go Google it across the planet and they see it.
[3:55:01.260 --> 3:55:07.940]  All they're gonna do is look at the picture and they're gonna see Obama's mug shot there.
[3:55:07.940 --> 3:55:13.820]  It's all subliminal messages and they're really slick on doing it, on convincing us that no
[3:55:13.820 --> 3:55:19.420]  one wants President Trump, especially black people.
[3:55:19.420 --> 3:55:24.740]  And like I said in the beginning, when I first came on, that Google had a panel of people
[3:55:24.740 --> 3:55:30.820]  trying to talk about how can we change the outcome of an election?
[3:55:30.820 --> 3:55:38.540]  Why would a social media platform, a Google search engine, have meetings about how to
[3:55:38.540 --> 3:55:44.860]  change the outcome of an election?
[3:55:44.860 --> 3:55:49.940]  If you don't think we're in war, then you're just a casualty.
[3:55:49.940 --> 3:55:54.980]  If you don't think it's going to get worse, then you're already lost.
[3:55:54.980 --> 3:55:58.020]  And a lot of people ask me, well, how do you think it's going to get worse?
[3:55:58.020 --> 3:56:04.100]  You know how it's going to get worse because just like Google showing Obama there, they're
[3:56:04.100 --> 3:56:07.340]  indoctrinating our children today.
[3:56:07.340 --> 3:56:11.580]  The children that's going to grow up and be young adults within four to five years from
[3:56:11.580 --> 3:56:17.700]  now, they are going to be so brainwashed because of all the indoctrination that's taking place,
[3:56:17.700 --> 3:56:22.020]  they are going to be worse than the adults that are walking around today.
[3:56:22.020 --> 3:56:23.980]  That's how it's going to get worse.
[3:56:23.980 --> 3:56:26.940]  You don't have to believe me.
[3:56:26.940 --> 3:56:30.660]  To be honest with you, I can care less if you don't believe me.
[3:56:30.660 --> 3:56:34.620]  I'm just telling you now, you can believe, you can hear me now.
[3:56:34.620 --> 3:56:37.340]  You can believe me later on.
[3:56:37.340 --> 3:56:42.180]  And when it comes to the forefront, you're going to remember, I remember some dude was
[3:56:42.180 --> 3:56:44.260]  saying that it's going to get worse.
[3:56:44.260 --> 3:56:46.880]  And most people know exactly what I'm talking about.
[3:56:46.880 --> 3:56:53.820]  Most people know because people are not dumb like the liberal left would like us to believe.
[3:56:53.820 --> 3:56:59.260]  The American people are strong, they're very strong.
[3:56:59.260 --> 3:57:03.860]  That's why you have to support organizations like infowords.com.

[3:58:43.940 --> 3:58:49.200]  Info wars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine introducing pollen block.
[3:58:49.200 --> 3:58:54.380]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[3:58:54.380 --> 3:59:01.220]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[3:59:01.220 --> 3:59:07.100]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[3:59:07.100 --> 3:59:10.420]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[3:59:10.420 --> 3:59:15.340]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit
[3:59:15.340 --> 3:59:20.420]  of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[3:59:20.420 --> 3:59:21.420]  symptoms.
[3:59:21.420 --> 3:59:26.860]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine, in fact, current research
[3:59:26.860 --> 3:59:31.660]  has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme
[3:59:31.660 --> 3:59:35.820]  that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[3:59:35.820 --> 3:59:38.500]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[3:59:38.500 --> 3:59:51.620]  Get to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
