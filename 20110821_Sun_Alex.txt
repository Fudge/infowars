[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We've got it
[00:07.400 --> 00:09.400]  Waging war on corruption
[00:11.400 --> 00:17.480]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:17.480 --> 00:19.480]  Oh
[00:26.960 --> 00:30.560]  It is Sunday the 21st day of August
[00:32.600 --> 00:35.880]  2011 we're gonna be live here for the next two hours
[00:37.880 --> 00:43.040]  Coming up at around 20 after I'm going to
[00:43.040 --> 00:46.440]  Present a live report to you
[00:47.440 --> 00:52.080]  Breaking down the fact that the military industrial complex
[00:52.800 --> 00:57.280]  Itself owned by offshore banks has not just conquered most of the world
[00:57.680 --> 01:00.560]  But it's also trying to conquer free humanity
[01:00.960 --> 01:05.480]  Trying to eradicate the family trying to eradicate all forms of independence
[01:06.200 --> 01:11.240]  Which this corporate Borg sees as a threat to its absolute eternal
[01:11.240 --> 01:18.280]  Domination over humanity, but the social engineers now for over 80 years have called the final
[01:19.080 --> 01:21.080]  Revolution against humanity
[01:21.720 --> 01:24.120]  This is the control freak revolution
[01:24.800 --> 01:30.800]  Obviously the reports have gotten a lot of attention up at info wars comm and prison planet comm Ron Paul
[01:30.800 --> 01:35.840]  They're setting the stage for violence in this country
[01:36.160 --> 01:38.160]  That is one of the headlines
[01:38.160 --> 01:44.560]  Robert Wannick who's reported for info wars comm also a great reporter with we are change, Minnesota
[01:45.640 --> 01:47.880]  did a video interview with Ron Paul and
[01:48.480 --> 01:51.520]  They said are we in danger with these FEMA camps this
[01:52.800 --> 01:57.800]  Emergency centers establishment act and Ron Paul said absolutely
[01:58.480 --> 02:05.280]  That's what you know the establishment wants they want to create violence. That's their plan very very powerful information
[02:05.280 --> 02:12.320]  So I thought that I would just give you a snapshot look at FEMA camps in this country
[02:12.320 --> 02:17.000]  And remember we already have the biggest prison population in the world
[02:17.680 --> 02:21.640]  We already have a military budget bigger than all other governments combined
[02:21.800 --> 02:26.440]  We have congressional reports of plans to expand the already existing
[02:27.360 --> 02:29.360]  internment facilities
[02:29.360 --> 02:35.600]  Now the mainstream media is reporting on this more but saying oh, they're just now deciding to get ready for this
[02:36.760 --> 02:38.760]  Because of the depression
[02:39.520 --> 02:43.080]  Or the greatest recession as Geithner has called it
[02:43.720 --> 02:45.960]  Well, we've told you for over
[02:47.080 --> 02:50.040]  16 years now, but intensely for 10
[02:50.560 --> 02:55.640]  That with the end of the Glass-Steagall Act and the derivatives bubble that this was their plan
[02:55.640 --> 03:02.080]  So they're economically destroying us posing as our saviors and as society begins to break down and unravel
[03:02.600 --> 03:07.880]  Many people are going to beg for the military to be used the military will be used
[03:08.720 --> 03:11.560]  They will do their job and shut down the rioting
[03:12.600 --> 03:14.840]  Then there'll be terror attacks
[03:16.000 --> 03:18.000]  Which are blamed on?
[03:18.560 --> 03:23.080]  domestic groups to the public will say well the army already dealt with the
[03:23.760 --> 03:25.360]  rioting thugs
[03:25.360 --> 03:31.720]  So it's reasonable that they're going after other troublemakers, you know for a decade
[03:31.720 --> 03:38.400]  I've been laying out this scenario and now you of course have seen it unfold over in England and other parts of Europe
[03:39.040 --> 03:45.280]  More and more people are asking how does Alex Jones predict the future. I don't predict the future
[03:46.720 --> 03:48.720]  the past is
[03:48.720 --> 03:55.480]  Is an example of how humans operate then you study current activities and globalist
[03:56.400 --> 03:59.320]  White papers and you know what their plan is the question is
[04:00.320 --> 04:03.320]  Does the public have the courage and the will and
[04:04.360 --> 04:09.080]  the self-preservation instincts to face the facts to get involved and
[04:09.720 --> 04:11.720]  to turn the tide because
[04:12.440 --> 04:14.440]  knowledge of this information and
[04:15.360 --> 04:16.600]  the
[04:16.600 --> 04:24.520]  Active resistance to it in the info war is what will save this Republic, but we have a case of very virulent
[04:25.120 --> 04:27.120]  hot tyranny
[04:27.360 --> 04:29.360]  Breathe them down our necks here
[04:29.800 --> 04:34.800]  But for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction and that's Ron Paul. That's Alex Jones. That's you
[04:35.320 --> 04:38.760]  You are the answer to the 1984 society
[04:39.480 --> 04:41.480]  You are 17
[04:41.480 --> 04:46.720]  76 and when we come back, I'm gonna give you a rundown of a lot of the other big news
[04:47.080 --> 04:51.720]  Then we're getting into this special report FEMA camps in America
[05:03.200 --> 05:08.240]  Tyranny is here the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality
[05:08.240 --> 05:16.000]  It really says that the state is God the United States has now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on earth
[05:16.160 --> 05:22.360]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide
[05:22.840 --> 05:28.720]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state
[05:28.920 --> 05:32.800]  Police state for Chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen
[05:32.800 --> 05:40.240]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship body scammers sound cameras citizen spies
[05:40.640 --> 05:43.240]  Stage terror and cameras on every street corner
[05:43.240 --> 05:49.680]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here

[06:26.720 --> 06:30.240]  I'm Alex Jones coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas
[06:30.680 --> 06:32.520]  Austin, Texas
[06:32.520 --> 06:38.760]  Blasting out on satellite global shortwave, and I know the Sunday show more than 60 a.m. and fm
[06:39.560 --> 06:45.160]  Affiliates number one radio talk show streamed on the web according to shoutcasts and other

[06:53.680 --> 06:55.560]  central time
[06:55.560 --> 06:56.920]  okay
[06:56.920 --> 07:04.240]  Coming up at the start of the next segment. I've got a special report Ron Paul addresses plans for civil unrest
[07:05.320 --> 07:06.760]  detention camps
[07:06.760 --> 07:12.880]  That's one of the reports we filed this weekend. We have some audio and videotape with Ron Paul discussing
[07:12.880 --> 07:16.000]  The FEMA camps that's posted up at
[07:17.080 --> 07:20.760]  Info wars comm and prison planet comm Ron Paul
[07:20.960 --> 07:27.160]  They're setting the stage for violence in this country asked by info wars correspondent Robert Wannick
[07:28.560 --> 07:36.480]  On video if he was concerned about these national emergency centers establishment act or that of
[07:37.400 --> 07:39.400]  officially funds the FEMA camps and
[07:39.400 --> 07:45.360]  If there was a danger of Americans being held in the camps for martial law Ron Paul responded
[07:45.360 --> 07:51.560]  Yeah, that's their goal. They're setting up the stage for violence in this country. No doubt about it
[07:52.080 --> 07:54.680]  Responded Paul and so I wanted to go over
[07:56.000 --> 08:03.280]  Why this is being established and set up a and be how it's going to be rolled out
[08:03.280 --> 08:12.040]  And we have in this article mainstream news this week going there are emergency centers for you because of the recession and the depression
[08:12.040 --> 08:14.040]  We just now
[08:14.640 --> 08:16.440]  Thought of this
[08:16.440 --> 08:20.800]  You see tyrants can't implode societies to consolidate
[08:21.440 --> 08:23.440]  control and to enrich themselves
[08:24.160 --> 08:30.520]  Without having a secret police without having a red terror without having a black
[08:30.520 --> 08:32.880]  Uniformed Jack booted
[08:33.840 --> 08:35.240]  Enforcement system
[08:35.240 --> 08:37.240]  These are absolutely cold-blooded
[08:38.320 --> 08:45.560]  multinational corporations that compete with each other at a very vicious level. They're absolutely ruthless and our naivete
[08:45.960 --> 08:49.840]  Has allowed this to unfold so I'm going to get into the history of
[08:52.360 --> 08:57.600]  Development of internment camps for Japanese Americans Italian Americans German Americans
[08:57.600 --> 09:01.320]  Hundreds of thousands that were held their land by the way taken
[09:02.160 --> 09:04.160]  many Italians Germans and
[09:04.560 --> 09:08.960]  Japanese even though their sons were serving in the military if you get out of the camp if you serve the military
[09:10.240 --> 09:15.280]  They they had their fishing boats take on their property some of the most valuable areas of San Francisco
[09:15.880 --> 09:19.160]  A lot of folks of course were tortured to death in the camps here in the United States
[09:19.640 --> 09:25.640]  So you need to understand that when you don't have a bill of rights and Constitution it turns loose great evil
[09:25.640 --> 09:31.080]  And we already have the largest prison population in the world not per capita
[09:31.080 --> 09:38.000]  No, no we have more than China with a billion and a half people or only three hundred and ten million and it's only getting worse
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.840]  See we have a predatory economy now. We don't have a free market
[09:42.520 --> 09:45.960]  It's being gobbled up by the predatory insider
[09:46.520 --> 09:50.560]  crony capitalist system that is only capitalist in name
[09:50.560 --> 09:55.200]  We're insiders operate and totally rule society
[09:55.640 --> 10:02.760]  So that report is coming up and then I'll get into your calls and more detail on on the other news
[10:02.760 --> 10:04.760]  We have here in front of us
[10:04.760 --> 10:07.160]  Speaking of crony capitalism. I
[10:08.160 --> 10:10.160]  remember the drudge report
[10:10.640 --> 10:12.640]  linked to our articles
[10:13.640 --> 10:15.840]  back in February back on
[10:16.600 --> 10:18.600]  February 4th and
[10:18.600 --> 10:24.200]  It became a big national news story and was discussed on the Sunday news shows and it was the first time
[10:24.440 --> 10:27.480]  I've ever had the White House actually address us
[10:28.120 --> 10:33.120]  And attack this radio show and say that we're insane liars. I remember
[10:33.720 --> 10:40.200]  This headline from February 4th Obama agenda to bankrupt power plants triggers blackouts
[10:40.200 --> 10:44.640]  remember the freezing weather across the US and record blackouts and
[10:45.320 --> 10:47.240]  then a day later
[10:47.240 --> 10:51.400]  White House attacks prison planet calm report on blackouts and
[10:52.440 --> 10:58.800]  You can go read the White House report their their their communications director Dan Pfeiffer
[10:59.240 --> 11:01.240]  Came out and said we were completely insane
[11:02.200 --> 11:07.840]  The problem was we were linking to the Texas power Commission and
[11:08.680 --> 11:10.680]  Others reports all we did
[11:11.520 --> 11:12.680]  was
[11:12.680 --> 11:17.560]  Also have family that work at power plants and I've a lot of listeners that work at them and
[11:18.200 --> 11:20.680]  I've known even under Bush and now
[11:21.160 --> 11:25.360]  Accelerating under Obama in the last two and a half years. They didn't let new plants open
[11:25.360 --> 11:29.440]  They they shut down a lot of existing plants. There's a three billion dollar plant
[11:30.360 --> 11:37.040]  Total you you heard me three three billion dollars in Corpus Christi one of the biggest in the country that the EPA
[11:37.040 --> 11:45.200]  Still hasn't allowed to open in the last year and it was the same in Kansas and Missouri and Oklahoma and California
[11:45.200 --> 11:47.200]  You saw the reports with the cold weather
[11:47.560 --> 11:55.440]  This year that well people are using more heat and we should have built more power plants because the population growing and
[11:56.320 --> 12:02.120]  So we're having these blackouts. I mean, that's what the power companies said were happening
[12:02.120 --> 12:05.800]  and that's what unfolded and
[12:07.160 --> 12:09.960]  The reason I mentioned that this story first is
[12:11.040 --> 12:13.400]  Because it's back in the news today
[12:14.760 --> 12:19.600]  This is out of the journal Sentinel utilities warn of higher rates because of pollution rules
[12:20.280 --> 12:23.440]  Nothing comes out of the coal power plants, but water vapor and carbon
[12:25.280 --> 12:31.560]  Dioxide that plants live off of and then they put off oxygen humans excel carbon dioxide and Bill Gates has said
[12:31.560 --> 12:37.880]  Humans are bad for exhaling it part of the atmosphere of the planet part of the symbiotic system the carbon cycle
[12:39.960 --> 12:43.080]  By the way, I covered this Friday and some people didn't believe me
[12:43.080 --> 12:49.920]  So I'm gonna repull it out of the stack later the London Guardian did go with the report that NASA officially has said that
[12:50.680 --> 12:56.800]  Space aliens are going to attack the United States and the entire planet if we don't pay carbon taxes to Al Gore
[12:56.800 --> 13:01.960]  That is not satire. That is not a joke. I know it's insane, but do not blame me
[13:03.440 --> 13:05.920]  Do not blame me because it sounds insane
[13:06.360 --> 13:13.000]  That's how dumb they think you are there it is London Guardian aliens may destroy humanity to protect other civilizations say scientist
[13:13.280 --> 13:18.960]  Rising greenhouse emissions could tip off aliens that we are rapidly expanding threat warrants of NASA report
[13:18.960 --> 13:23.120]  And they say pay money to the Rothschilds that own the big climate exchange with Al Gore
[13:23.120 --> 13:26.880]  And that's who publicly owns it just type in Rothschild's climate exchange
[13:27.000 --> 13:32.640]  Pay them to breathe or aliens will kill us and the NASA report says the aliens may strike any minute. I mean
[13:33.120 --> 13:36.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not the conspiracy theorist
[13:36.560 --> 13:41.040]  For for you know being right 99% of the time and knowing how things work. Okay?
[13:42.520 --> 13:44.520]  All right
[13:45.320 --> 13:47.880]  They're shutting down power plants all over the country
[13:47.880 --> 13:55.680]  They've shut down two in the last decade here in Austin. One of them was a city-owned utility now now. Why would big mega?
[13:56.400 --> 14:04.120]  power companies like General Electric who was given a waiver in February from their own rules that they wrote they
[14:04.320 --> 14:08.960]  They're there will some of their former top people run the greenhouse gas
[14:09.720 --> 14:11.720]  section of the EPA
[14:12.680 --> 14:14.680]  Just like Monsanto runs all the major
[14:14.680 --> 14:20.080]  Food and Drug Administration positions. It's a real or the Goldman Sachs J.P. Morgan have all the fellow reserve
[14:20.880 --> 14:22.720]  honchos and
[14:22.720 --> 14:26.520]  Treasury secretaries this is a mafia operation and
[14:27.480 --> 14:30.160]  They're given a total waiver on all their plants
[14:30.160 --> 14:34.680]  So they're they're building new ones if you get them to build your plant and pay them protection money
[14:34.800 --> 14:36.800]  Then you are given a waiver
[14:37.160 --> 14:38.880]  but the head of
[14:38.880 --> 14:44.000]  The Energy Department said just a few months ago quote massive numbers of plants will be shut down
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.880]  He went on to say they're looking at shutting down over 300 now. That's going to do two things
[14:49.360 --> 14:53.560]  That's going to more than double and I'm talking about the next two years your power cost
[14:53.560 --> 14:55.560]  You've already seen them go up or the double
[14:56.640 --> 15:03.520]  And it's going to cause rolling blackouts. We're going to be like Romania or Venezuela or or Iran now
[15:03.520 --> 15:07.640]  We're going to be a third world country and and your your power is going to go off a lot
[15:07.640 --> 15:15.000]  See, this is what dictatorships and corrupt systems are all about is total and complete domination
[15:15.880 --> 15:20.920]  They'd rather sell you less for more and only have a few insiders involved
[15:21.520 --> 15:25.640]  So here is the journal Sentinel utilities warn of higher rates because of pollution rules
[15:26.240 --> 15:32.680]  Here is the Washington Post getting ready for a wave of coal plant shutdowns that provides 51% of our power
[15:32.680 --> 15:36.680]  And I've got a new one here
[15:37.560 --> 15:43.680]  Where the news breaks down new greenhouse gas rules to cause rolling blackouts
[15:44.560 --> 15:51.160]  So, you know what? I'm going to finish up with how mafia government works in the next segment
[15:52.560 --> 15:56.280]  Well, you saw thousands of companies get waivers from Obama from the health care
[15:56.280 --> 15:58.280]  See you

[17:34.640 --> 17:36.640]  Others don't
[17:36.640 --> 17:38.640]  We turn jeans inside out
[17:38.640 --> 17:40.640]  Diamond gusset jeans
[17:40.640 --> 17:43.640]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality
[17:43.640 --> 17:49.640]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you could ride all day with confidence
[17:49.640 --> 17:52.640]  Order yours at gusset.com
[17:52.640 --> 17:54.640]  Diamond gusset jeans got it
[17:54.640 --> 17:56.640]  Others don't
[17:58.640 --> 18:02.640]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply
[18:02.640 --> 18:05.640]  Folks there are some truly dangerous trends forming
[18:05.640 --> 18:09.640]  And I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away
[18:09.640 --> 18:13.640]  Number one, study the past. History really does repeat itself
[18:13.640 --> 18:18.640]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends
[18:18.640 --> 18:21.640]  Number three, take decisive action
[18:21.640 --> 18:25.640]  A perfect storm is brewing or a global food crisis
[18:25.640 --> 18:30.640]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices Empty Shelves
[18:30.640 --> 18:34.640]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history
[18:34.640 --> 18:40.640]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits
[18:40.640 --> 18:45.640]  This book is only available at RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com
[18:45.640 --> 18:50.640]  You'll also get a free copy of supermarket survival, how to cut your grocery bills in half
[18:50.640 --> 18:54.640]  Again, that website is RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com
[18:54.640 --> 18:58.640]  That's RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com
[18:58.640 --> 19:03.640]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lunges Generator infuses the respiratory system
[19:03.640 --> 19:06.640]  With your self-produced colloidal silver solutions
[19:06.640 --> 19:09.640]  Yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lunges System
[19:09.640 --> 19:14.640]  And how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body
[19:14.640 --> 19:19.640]  My name is Mario Safaldi, and I'm the developer of the Silver Lunges Generator
[19:19.640 --> 19:24.640]  Not only does the Silver Lunges System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions
[19:24.640 --> 19:28.640]  It also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[19:28.640 --> 19:32.640]  To deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas
[19:32.640 --> 19:40.640]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system
[19:40.640 --> 19:44.640]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lunges System
[19:44.640 --> 19:50.640]  At www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lunges System works
[19:50.640 --> 19:54.640]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have
[19:54.640 --> 20:20.640]  That's www.silverlungs.com
[20:24.640 --> 20:31.640]  OK, we're going to look at FEMA Camp USA
[20:31.640 --> 20:37.640]  And the proof that the federal government owned by foreign banks through fraud
[20:37.640 --> 20:42.640]  Is preparing for a total collapse depression scenario
[20:42.640 --> 20:45.640]  The Pentagon admits they're preparing for it
[20:45.640 --> 20:51.640]  And the first lock-up of roving hordes that the public will beg to be locked up
[20:51.640 --> 20:56.640]  Because the minute the welfare crowd doesn't get their paycheck, they're going to riot
[20:56.640 --> 21:02.640]  Then the precedent will be set to have the military on the streets
[21:02.640 --> 21:10.640]  And then the staged events will begin as a pretext to go after the political resistance
[21:10.640 --> 21:16.640]  To the complete economic designed implosion of the United States
[21:16.640 --> 21:20.640]  It has to be destroyed once and for all to bring in the new system
[21:20.640 --> 21:23.640]  That's why they're doing these culturally shocking things
[21:23.640 --> 21:28.640]  Like having TSA actually stick their hands down many people's pants
[21:28.640 --> 21:31.640]  Or having cameras in school bathrooms
[21:31.640 --> 21:36.640]  Or having public schools announce, yes, we're watching your children over laptops in the shower
[21:36.640 --> 21:39.640]  When they're at home in Philadelphia
[21:39.640 --> 21:43.640]  This is all being done to absolutely break your will
[21:43.640 --> 21:48.640]  That's why Bloomberg and AP Come Out and Say Yeah, the government took the veteran's death benefits
[21:48.640 --> 21:54.640]  Over the last 12 years, they secretly made a deal to allow insurance companies to steal their life insurance they paid for
[21:54.640 --> 22:01.640]  Yeah, they're going to go ahead and slash in half people who've served the military for 20 years or more
[22:01.640 --> 22:04.640]  And have their 50% pension, you're not going to be getting it
[22:04.640 --> 22:08.640]  Besides, even if you get it, it's going to be devalued
[22:08.640 --> 22:16.640]  And they've done the psychological warfare actuaries that they know a lot of 50, 60, 70, 80-year-old vets
[22:16.640 --> 22:18.640]  And that means that people are going to get violent
[22:18.640 --> 22:21.640]  And they're going to use that to start arresting everybody
[22:21.640 --> 22:24.640]  The globalists are sitting offshore
[22:24.640 --> 22:28.640]  They don't care if cops and military get shoot up fighting old cops and military
[22:28.640 --> 22:33.640]  Again, the globalist, people think of things in a two-dimensional warfare model
[22:33.640 --> 22:40.640]  Of black against white, black checkers or red checkers versus black checkers
[22:40.640 --> 22:43.640]  Or white chess pieces versus black chess pieces
[22:43.640 --> 22:47.640]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[22:47.640 --> 22:52.640]  The globalist for thousands of years fund all sides of conflicts sometimes three or four sides
[22:52.640 --> 22:54.640]  But people don't want to get that
[22:54.640 --> 22:58.160]  They think of it as Ford Chevy Coke Pepsi
[22:58.160 --> 23:01.640]  Dallas Cowboys Washington Redskins
[23:01.640 --> 23:07.640]  And because of that, because of that we're going to get hurt real, real bad
[23:07.640 --> 23:12.640]  I'm sorry I said I'd get into the FEMA camps and how they're going to get us to the FEMA camps
[23:12.640 --> 23:18.080]  camps. Oh, you're going to be begging to go to the FEMA camps. This isn't going to be like with
[23:18.080 --> 23:21.840]  Hitler or Stalin where you don't want to go. The way they're going to advertise it is you're
[23:21.840 --> 23:27.360]  going to be fighting to get into them. I first discovered this going to urban warfare drills
[23:27.360 --> 23:33.360]  12 years ago. And I guess some, some cases 14 years ago, and they would always have the role
[23:33.360 --> 23:40.160]  player screaming, I'm an American, you can't take my rights, let me into the camp. Oh, yes. But
[23:40.160 --> 23:45.200]  once you're in the camp, well, you are biometrically scanned and troublemakers are taken to a
[23:45.200 --> 23:54.160]  special area. And that's low and behold what they said with the emergency centers establishment act.
[23:54.160 --> 23:58.560]  They said that this is going to be an area and it'll have its own jail and things where people
[23:58.560 --> 24:06.400]  that are homeless in mass go. And see, we already have right at 50 million people on food stamps.
[24:06.400 --> 24:11.360]  They say 45, but there's another 5 million or so on supplemental. In fact, it's really above 50
[24:11.360 --> 24:17.920]  million now. Those are, those are digital food lines. Those are people with food line carts.
[24:19.440 --> 24:25.440]  50 million. And see, they're still going to get their creds put on those. They're just not going
[24:25.440 --> 24:33.600]  to buy Jack Diddley squat and that these are entitled people. And what do you think they're
[24:33.600 --> 24:39.440]  going to do? Well, they're going to start rioting. You think this summer's been bad? I predict next
[24:39.440 --> 24:43.440]  summer you're going to see major fireworks. You know, I predicted riots all over Europe
[24:44.080 --> 24:51.120]  two years ago this year. Oh, I'm, I'm sorry. I was getting into the to the crony insiders
[24:52.000 --> 24:57.440]  and how our economy is going from a true free market to a total insider operation.
[24:57.440 --> 25:03.600]  If you read the founding fathers writings or, or, or you read Americana right up until the last 50
[25:03.600 --> 25:08.560]  years, everything was about how the big boys collude together to shut down the little people.
[25:09.440 --> 25:14.800]  And that doesn't even mean in, in business. I mean, they will big aggra openly writes laws
[25:14.800 --> 25:22.560]  to shut down small farms and ranches. Insurance companies wrote the healthcare law to make 35
[25:22.560 --> 25:27.120]  million people get their product and to let insurance companies and HMOs control what doctors
[25:27.120 --> 25:31.600]  can do for care to lower the standard. Bill Gates admitted that. He said, yeah, we do need to kill
[25:31.600 --> 25:36.640]  grandma. Remember the cover of news week, the case for killing granny. I know it sounds crazy,
[25:36.640 --> 25:42.800]  but it was on the cover. Bill Gates said it. Don't give grandma treatment. Take care of 10 teachers
[25:43.440 --> 25:49.920]  telling you that somebody loses. You win the minute you have that attitude, civilization falls.
[25:49.920 --> 25:55.920]  The minute you give into corruption, just a little bit, suddenly it races through the system.
[25:59.600 --> 26:04.400]  I thought everybody was like me. I thought, I mean, I came come from both sides of my family,
[26:04.400 --> 26:12.080]  Christian, hardworking, Protestant type people who just wouldn't cheat anybody out of a nickel.
[26:12.720 --> 26:16.480]  Pull over. And I mean, I remember being a kid and going, dad, please don't stop. Please. No.
[26:16.480 --> 26:20.160]  He stopped and tried to change every person's tire that was broken down.
[26:22.240 --> 26:26.560]  Road trips were hell. A few times people tried to rob him in the last few years,
[26:26.560 --> 26:30.640]  so he stopped. That's all part of the collapse of society, but I come from goody two shoes.
[26:30.640 --> 26:36.960]  You know, I'm a weirdo. You see, I grew up and when I saw cops dealing drugs going to high school
[26:36.960 --> 26:41.280]  in Dallas, I got mad and spoke about it. So they let my dad know we're going to kill your son if
[26:41.280 --> 26:47.040]  you don't leave town and we moved to Austin. I guess I've kind of got a serpico type lifestyle
[26:47.760 --> 26:51.520]  history. We had Frank Serpico, legendary detective on Friday.
[26:54.080 --> 27:00.240]  So see, I guess this is what America wants. People think corruption's cute and fun. You're
[27:00.240 --> 27:05.440]  going to find out, folks. I mean, this country is going to be judged. You want to say 51 million
[27:05.440 --> 27:11.680]  aborted babies aren't humans? The government's going to say you're not a human. Everything we do,
[27:11.680 --> 27:15.680]  every lie we go along with comes back on us and nobody should forget that.
[27:17.920 --> 27:22.000]  You think I'm proud of the fact that we're right about everything we talk about? No,
[27:22.000 --> 27:28.480]  I'm not proud of that. It's very sad, very painful. It's very painful to have everything I've
[27:28.480 --> 27:36.000]  analyzed coming true and only confirming, only confirming it. And there are still a lot of
[27:36.000 --> 27:40.400]  good people in this country and it's because you're blind and you're Dudley Do-right,
[27:42.560 --> 27:51.200]  like people like my dad. Because you're so good, you can't believe this is happening and that's
[27:51.200 --> 27:56.240]  why evil wins. What's the devil's biggest trick? Convincing the world he doesn't exist. And I'm
[27:56.240 --> 28:03.280]  here to tell you, folks, evil exists and we better get up on our hind legs right down like a mama
[28:03.280 --> 28:08.240]  grizzly bear or we're going to get overrun. Every country on earth has had mass arrest,
[28:08.240 --> 28:15.200]  mass exterminations and killings every hundred years or so. The United States has been a rare
[28:15.200 --> 28:19.520]  jewel despite the fact we've had some problems. If you study history, ladies and gentlemen,
[28:19.520 --> 28:27.600]  you know what is about to unfold in this country. What is now beginning to unfold is the norm,
[28:27.600 --> 28:34.880]  not the exception. You need to understand, we now have a criminal government filled with criminals
[28:35.520 --> 28:40.400]  or Dudley Do-right idiots who are compartmentalized and don't realize what they're helping
[28:40.400 --> 28:45.200]  happen. Now, again, here's the former Star Telegram. New EPA rule could lead to rolling
[28:45.200 --> 28:50.880]  blackouts in Texas. PUC chairwoman says, well, that's already what's causing it.
[28:51.760 --> 28:54.880]  It's mafia takeover. Well, they're right back. Stay with us.
[29:01.200 --> 29:06.080]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones. I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings,

[30:03.920 --> 30:09.120]  we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years. He says it will change
[30:09.120 --> 30:13.680]  everything about our lives. The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even
[30:13.680 --> 30:17.600]  how you take care of your health and your own family. Now this man has made some outrageous
[30:17.600 --> 30:22.880]  predictions over the years. The crazy part is he's usually right. You see he predicted the collapse
[30:22.880 --> 30:27.520]  of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[30:27.520 --> 30:33.120]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently he created a video which you can watch
[30:33.120 --> 30:37.680]  online for free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye
[30:37.680 --> 30:42.240]  opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.
[30:42.240 --> 30:46.480]  He explains everything you need to know including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[30:46.480 --> 30:53.120]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America. The number three.

[32:03.120 --> 32:09.040]  in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this
[32:09.040 --> 32:15.280]  agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I have tremendous influence
[32:15.280 --> 32:21.200]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all
[32:21.200 --> 32:27.760]  of us as American citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[32:27.760 --> 32:34.080]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[32:34.080 --> 32:39.120]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[32:39.120 --> 32:43.840]  is saying who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[32:43.840 --> 32:51.360]  Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on dvd

[32:58.160 --> 33:08.160]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network.
[33:28.160 --> 33:45.360]  All right, we are back live. By the way, the nation
[33:45.360 --> 33:58.640]  the nation magazine is reporting strat for disputes obl killing in pakistan.
[34:00.800 --> 34:11.840]  That is the headline strat for disputes obl killing in abadabad pakistan. Of course it's a complete
[34:11.840 --> 34:16.880]  fraud. I have talked to the father of a navy seal who my family has known for more than a decade.
[34:18.640 --> 34:24.960]  At their house there's photos of son and navy training with his dad and all the navy seals
[34:24.960 --> 34:32.960]  at events whose friend is in SEAL team six and they believe that that helicopter two weeks ago
[34:32.960 --> 34:40.640]  was blown up to get rid of witnesses and the scuttlebutt is that yes they did not kill bin Laden.
[34:40.640 --> 34:46.400]  What do you think I just get on the air and make stuff up like that? But here's strat for one of
[34:46.400 --> 34:56.960]  the most highly respected internationally private intelligence organizations that gets a lot of
[34:56.960 --> 35:05.920]  big contracts and they are saying that they do not agree with the US central intelligence agency
[35:05.920 --> 35:12.400]  claim that the man killed in pakistan compound by US Navy SEALs was al qaeda chief Osama bin Laden
[35:13.280 --> 35:20.720]  and they go through the full report at the nation magazine that is linked up at info wars.com
[35:20.720 --> 35:27.440]  and prisonplanet.com. I know strat for is based here in austin texas. I know that they even do
[35:27.440 --> 35:36.480]  weekly commentary on our affiliate KLBJ 590 KLBJ. You can find those commentaries at what is it
[35:36.480 --> 35:45.120]  590klbj.com but I definitely want to get them on tomorrow that is big big big breaking news and
[35:45.120 --> 35:49.920]  we'll talk more about that after I get into the FEMA camp situation. You see ladies and gentlemen
[35:49.920 --> 35:55.040]  I don't just get up here and shoot my mouth off sometimes I get angry and yell and scream and I
[35:55.040 --> 36:03.760]  probably shouldn't but then I realize how successful we've been and I say to myself you can't argue
[36:03.760 --> 36:09.920]  with success. I think over the years some of the ranting and the raving actually gets people to pay
[36:09.920 --> 36:17.200]  attention in a sea of radio and TV shows and internet news websites. I think at the end of the
[36:17.200 --> 36:24.240]  day God used my obnoxiousness as a way to actually break through the electronic Berlin wall and reach
[36:24.240 --> 36:30.640]  people. I mean infowars.com is now the second largest alternative news site in the world
[36:31.200 --> 36:38.240]  after drudgereport.com. Then we had prisonplanet.com and I could have never imagined that we'd be in
[36:38.240 --> 36:45.280]  that position with millions of readers every day something that mainstream media would kill for.
[36:46.160 --> 36:51.120]  Now we still have this idea in our heads it's kind of like you're 40 years old
[36:51.120 --> 36:58.880]  you're an Olympic wrestler but you go to visit your grandpa who's 85 years old
[37:00.160 --> 37:03.520]  and you still are kind of scared of him and think he can kick your butt
[37:04.720 --> 37:07.760]  just because it's grandpa you remember looking up to him when you were little
[37:08.400 --> 37:14.080]  and it's really the same thing with the mainstream media they are not the mainstream media they are
[37:14.080 --> 37:22.240]  a joke their numbers are dwindling down to nothing they've lost almost all credibility and that's
[37:22.240 --> 37:25.760]  why they're teaming up with the government now to promote the internet kill switches and
[37:25.760 --> 37:34.720]  shutting off cell phones during protest in san francisco and one of the big outfits what facebook
[37:34.720 --> 37:44.880]  just got caught censoring a governor's site that criticized obama they're desperate they're desperate
[37:44.880 --> 37:53.280]  right now they're like a cornered rat and that's why once a corrupt oligarchy's taken over a society
[37:53.280 --> 37:59.120]  stolen the wealth destroyed the productivity they then go to the femacamp model they go to the
[37:59.120 --> 38:10.720]  black uniform soviet chinese nazi model the fidel castro model the care marouge model the zimbabwean
[38:10.720 --> 38:18.640]  model that's the model about 95 percent of the time in history they go to that model and they
[38:18.640 --> 38:25.600]  live in their private palaces and you live as a third world slave you know uh the dictator of
[38:25.600 --> 38:31.200]  romania chelcescu was interviewed and they said why do you only give the entire country power maybe
[38:31.200 --> 38:37.680]  two three hours a day and he said because i might as well just charge him more for less this is how
[38:37.680 --> 38:46.080]  i teach him who's boss same thing in north korea they enjoy cutting off our power they enjoy
[38:46.720 --> 38:52.560]  restricting us can you imagine being general electric and being given the waiver to build
[38:52.560 --> 38:57.280]  new plants and keep their old plants operating but then to be able to shut down all their competition
[38:59.600 --> 39:05.600]  i mean you know diamonds all over africa are on the ground you can pan for them in rivers like
[39:06.160 --> 39:13.360]  like uh gold you know diamonds on a real chart of gems are in the semi precious range
[39:14.240 --> 39:17.840]  they're not even at the top of the semi precious range they're down in the middle
[39:17.840 --> 39:23.840]  they're like agate or something but agate is all over the world diamonds are only in a few places
[39:24.960 --> 39:30.640]  now they did discover a hoard in several areas of arkansas i knew about this a decade before it
[39:30.640 --> 39:35.440]  was admitted in the news um my dad has friends from college in the diamond business some of the
[39:35.440 --> 39:42.480]  biggest um who would talk about how evil uh the oppenheimers and the beers were and how they ran
[39:42.480 --> 39:46.400]  this world monopoly of diamonds but when they did find diamonds in arkansas then they found
[39:46.400 --> 39:53.360]  diamonds in canada both cases with this french family that my dad you know knew going way back
[39:53.360 --> 39:58.880]  to college days in the dallas in both cases they would come in and have the government announce
[39:58.880 --> 40:03.600]  it to be an environmental preserve even if it was land they bought and the government would move
[40:03.600 --> 40:07.920]  to block them but then they were still able in one case to sell the property they'd bought to the
[40:07.920 --> 40:16.080]  government for three billion dollars oh that's the best part the u.s government other governments
[40:16.080 --> 40:23.120]  pay money to people so that they can't use the land that has the diamonds it's the same thing with
[40:23.120 --> 40:28.080]  power and water and everything else they are training you that it doesn't exist and there's not enough
[40:28.080 --> 40:33.360]  of it yeah there were all this lecturing about drought and there is a surface drought in central
[40:33.360 --> 40:37.520]  texas the only place there's a true drought is in west texas where they really do have their
[40:37.520 --> 40:42.080]  aquifers running very low they could drill their wells deeper but the point is that there is a real
[40:42.080 --> 40:48.640]  drought in west texas there's a surface drought uh in central texas and they're on the news don't
[40:48.640 --> 40:54.560]  wash your clothes as much wear your clothes three four times don't drain your swimming pools water

[47:37.520 --> 47:43.920]  here's ron paul i have a question why you're saying that do you think americans are justified
[47:43.920 --> 47:49.360]  in thinking that hr 645 could lead to detainment camps for america citizens during our i don't
[47:49.360 --> 47:55.440]  know this number she'll have to tell me the emergency center establishing i know that's their goal
[47:55.440 --> 48:00.800]  they are setting up the stage for violence in this computer if we go down about it
[48:00.800 --> 48:09.600]  hr 645 establishing emergency centers for disaster relief and actual emergency
[48:12.640 --> 48:14.000]  here's ron paul one more time
[48:16.400 --> 48:25.840]  on hr stage for violence in this country all right now there's that report i i hope that
[48:25.840 --> 48:30.640]  robert wanick a friend of the show will also post it without the music because it makes it not as um
[48:32.160 --> 48:40.240]  not as conductive on radio but you see something like this ron paul being asked hey should we
[48:40.240 --> 48:47.440]  worried about americans and fema and people being put in these camps yeah that's their goal they're
[48:47.440 --> 48:53.040]  setting up the stage for violence in this country no doubt about it responded ron paul
[48:53.040 --> 49:00.640]  and then we have our full reports and congressional hearings dealing with this legislation now here's
[49:00.640 --> 49:09.040]  what's scary about it when we got this bill now a year and a half ago and we read it it was exactly
[49:09.040 --> 49:15.280]  what i'd seen at urban warfare drills with army marines fema and others and i've videotaped all
[49:15.280 --> 49:21.680]  this in the late 90s um the marines would come up with their machine guns and say turn your
[49:21.680 --> 49:28.800]  camera off it's all in my film police state 2000 and police state to the takeover 1999 2000 two films
[49:28.800 --> 49:35.840]  i put out and we said then with economists this isn't coming now they're just preparing the military
[49:35.840 --> 49:41.280]  and and getting everybody ready for it and having the military also interviewed in those films uh and
[49:41.280 --> 49:48.000]  in future films like road to tyranny military officers uh who had raided gun shops going back
[49:48.000 --> 49:53.520]  even into the 1980s as part of secret programs so there's a long-term secret program to get rid
[49:53.520 --> 49:59.520]  of posse commentatus now you see regular army at the kanducky derby uh or at the super bowl or you
[49:59.520 --> 50:05.680]  see the army running dwi checkpoints uh in los angeles and other areas now it's just in your
[50:05.680 --> 50:11.920]  face it's just and homeland security admitted two years ago we've got a deal for brigade homeland
[50:11.920 --> 50:17.600]  starting with 4 000 troops it'll then be 378 000 troops and now they've announced they've got
[50:17.600 --> 50:23.840]  100 000 ready they've got to have the 300 plus thousand ready by 2012 i mean they are getting
[50:23.840 --> 50:31.680]  ready for this and then if you talk about it you get laughed at just like earlier in the year i said
[50:31.680 --> 50:35.920]  well here's the different power commission saying they can't open new power plants and
[50:35.920 --> 50:39.600]  the population's grown so they're gonna have rolling blackouts and cold weather and hot weather
[50:39.600 --> 50:44.320]  we put an article together and the white house of taxes that says we're crazy and then today
[50:44.320 --> 50:50.800]  it's all back in the news for our star telegram washington post roiders you name it all saying
[50:50.800 --> 50:58.880]  exactly what i said six months ago top private intelligence uh group comes out and says ben
[50:58.880 --> 51:03.520]  laden wouldn't kill that compound according to their analysis and their sources of course he wasn't
[51:04.720 --> 51:10.000]  i mean i'm sorry ladies and gentlemen we're being lied to obama said we'd be in libya
[51:10.000 --> 51:15.040]  days not weeks it's four and a half months later every week they say triply is falling
[51:15.840 --> 51:20.720]  i'm not a fan of qaddafi but i'm an even bigger enemy of the real al-qaeda groups
[51:20.720 --> 51:25.280]  that is admittedly the leadership of the rebels you know that's admitted
[51:26.880 --> 51:32.160]  and you can't dress this thing up you can't get away from reality you can't get away from the
[51:32.160 --> 51:38.240]  reality that hundreds of power plants are now being shut down that aren't insiders and power prices
[51:38.240 --> 51:43.440]  are going up because there's less competition and there's blackouts happening and the white house's
[51:43.440 --> 51:52.080]  responses we're crazy even when the texas commission says it's happening texas supplies the power to
[51:52.080 --> 52:02.000]  five states the dominant power supplier to five states new mexico louisiana arkansas oklahoma
[52:02.000 --> 52:08.880]  kansas have you noticed your power prices went up the city of austin came out last year and said
[52:08.880 --> 52:15.360]  we're going to double power prices uh what was it 3.6 billion the next two years we're going with
[52:15.360 --> 52:19.920]  the carbon taxes what is the carbon well what does it do to charge people more power more money for
[52:19.920 --> 52:26.800]  power has nothing to do with it china builds three power plants a week we built less than three a year
[52:26.800 --> 52:34.560]  this is the deindustrialization of this country i'm digressing here's the headline ron paul
[52:34.560 --> 52:40.240]  they're setting the stage for violence in this country there meaning homeland security we have
[52:40.240 --> 52:44.000]  the other reports on it and we have our other report uh dealing with it all
[52:47.040 --> 52:52.480]  let me just go ahead and play you a clip now the clergy response teams we got these documents
[52:52.480 --> 52:58.800]  three years before local newscast around the nation this is out of new orleans aired pieces
[52:58.800 --> 53:03.360]  telling the public yes it's true your preachers are being paid by the government and trained to
[53:03.360 --> 53:11.440]  tell you to go to camps and turn your guns in and take shots we got these documents in 2005
[53:11.440 --> 53:18.480]  man time's flown three years later it comes out people thought we had fake documents even though
[53:18.480 --> 53:24.800]  they had the phone numbers to femo on them okay i mean how creepy is that they've got preachers
[53:24.800 --> 53:30.720]  now over a hundred thousand nationwide trained to spy on their flock and to tell them to submit
[53:30.720 --> 53:37.600]  to government here okay we're going to play the defosito first this is uh a congressman wanting
[53:37.600 --> 53:42.160]  to see the martial law plans and being told by bush you can't see him under the presidential
[53:42.160 --> 53:48.160]  decision directive and it's the same under obama see we effectively have a dictatorship not
[53:48.160 --> 53:53.520]  of the president himself he's a blackmailed kept controlled teleprompter reader no matter who it is
[53:54.400 --> 53:58.480]  unless it's ron paul they're all globalist paid for over and over again to get to this point
[53:58.480 --> 54:05.280]  they've proven themselves political prostitutes and you have to understand the office of the
[54:05.280 --> 54:09.840]  presidency now through its executive power i mean look at obama launching wars without congressional
[54:09.840 --> 54:14.000]  approval obama putting carbon taxes in without congressional approval obama just legalized
[54:14.000 --> 54:22.800]  300 000 deportees saying i i don't need congress to pass amnesty i might deport felons i feel
[54:22.800 --> 54:29.600]  that violates federal law immigration law see that's a dictator and and it's it's getting
[54:29.600 --> 54:34.720]  worse by the minute let's go ahead and play the clip of the congressman talking about the martial
[54:34.720 --> 54:43.360]  law plans most americans would agree that it would be prudent to have a plan to provide for the
[54:43.360 --> 54:48.720]  continuity of government and the rule of law in case of a devastating terrorist attack or
[54:48.720 --> 54:54.720]  natural disaster plan to provide for the cooperation the coordination and continued functioning of all
[54:54.720 --> 55:00.400]  three branches of the government the bush administration tells us they have such a plan
[55:00.400 --> 55:06.800]  they introduced a little sketchy public version that's clearly inadequate and and doesn't really
[55:06.800 --> 55:12.320]  tell us what they have in mind but they said don't worry there's a detailed classified version
[55:12.320 --> 55:18.400]  but now they've denied the entire homeland security committee of the united states house of
[55:18.400 --> 55:25.760]  representatives access to their so-called detailed plan to provide for continuity of government they
[55:25.760 --> 55:32.800]  say trust us trust us the people who brought us katrina to be competent in face of a disaster
[55:32.800 --> 55:38.160]  trust us all right that's enough brought us warrantless wiretapping and other excesses
[55:38.160 --> 55:43.520]  eroding and it's only expanded now we did pull up the clergy response team clip just go to youtube
[55:43.520 --> 55:50.000]  and type this in it's also my film police state for the rise of fema now the very first word gets
[55:50.000 --> 55:57.600]  partially cut off she says will martial law ever be declared in america here's that clip
[55:58.160 --> 56:05.280]  will ever become a reality in america some fear any nuclear biological or chemical attack on us
[56:05.280 --> 56:10.800]  territory might trigger just that and as case lay news told jeff ferrell discovered the clergy
[56:10.800 --> 56:18.800]  would help the government with potentially their biggest problem us from my cold dead hand charlton
[56:18.800 --> 56:25.040]  heston's famous declaration captures a truly american value the overarching desire to protect
[56:25.040 --> 56:30.560]  our freedoms but gun confiscation is exactly what happened during the state of emergency
[56:30.560 --> 56:36.400]  following hurricane katrina in new orleans u.s troops also arrived something far easier to do
[56:36.400 --> 56:43.840]  even now thanks to last year's elimination of the 1878 posse cometatus act that forbid u.s troops
[56:43.840 --> 56:50.640]  from policing on american soil if martial law weren't acted here at home like depicted in the
[56:50.640 --> 56:56.240]  movie the siege easing public fears and quelling dissent would be critical and that's exactly
[56:56.240 --> 57:01.680]  what the clergy response team as it's called helped accomplish in new warrants of jeff the primary
[57:01.680 --> 57:05.760]  thing that we say to anybody is let's walk and get this thing over with and then we'll sell the
[57:05.760 --> 57:10.960]  differences once the crisis is over such clergy response teams would walk a tightrope between
[57:10.960 --> 57:16.480]  the needs of the government versus the wishes of the public in a lot of cases these clergy would
[57:16.480 --> 57:21.520]  already be known in the neighborhoods in which they're helping to diffuse that situation for the
[57:21.520 --> 57:27.040]  clergy one of the biggest tools that they will have in helping calm the public down or obey the
[57:27.040 --> 57:34.240]  law is the bible itself all right right there did you hear that the government versus the people
[57:34.240 --> 57:39.440]  the government's biggest problem us i thought we're the government roman's 13 we're the government
[57:39.440 --> 57:43.760]  it's the government that's been taken over that's not obeying the law it's the government that's
[57:43.760 --> 57:48.240]  criminal you're not supposed to obey hitler or stalin we'll be right back with more congressional

[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:07.520]  the prospects of paying roughly double uh in the next few years for your electrical power you're
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:13.600]  already paying more under the uh unofficial carbon taxes the carbon taxes are they shut down

[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:26.560]  i mean why wouldn't big corporations come in if the people aren't aware and informed and they've
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:31.600]  got corrupt politicians they'll do whatever they're told wouldn't corporations come in and shut down

[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:05.680]  thing we've gone over the slippery slide we were starting to go over it and you know bush five years
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:11.840]  ago would say hey i promise i'm not spying on you without warrants i promise then it came out he was
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:19.280]  and so now they just go yeah we're spying on you yeah dinecourt runs child kidnapping rings well

[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:10.080]  folks there are some truly dangerous trends forming and i think it's important for my listeners to do
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:17.440]  three things right away number one study the past history really does repeat itself number two
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:23.520]  learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends number three take decisive action
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:29.840]  a perfect storm is brewing or a global food crisis that's why i'm telling everyone to
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:36.160]  read the new book rising prices empty shelves warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:42.240]  in history don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits this book is only available

[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:57.440]  that's rising prices empty shelves dot com
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:09.760]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:22.560]  so congressman ron paul is asked are you concerned about the emergency centers establishment act
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:28.480]  that openly says they'll build these giant camps all over the u.s to hold the american people
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:35.040]  and ron paul says let me read the quote here yeah that's their goal they're setting up the
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:42.640]  stage for violence in this country no doubt about it and he said on the show before he's concerned
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:48.000]  but again everything in that act is already in place it's just like when it came out the nsa
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.640]  had been spying on the american people without warrants across the board everything being
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:57.680]  filtered through spying systems at the major phone companies they went from saying they
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:02.960]  hadn't been doing it to go and yes we've been doing it congress passed a law congress passed a law
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:09.440]  and just said fourth amendment who needs it well congress also passed laws saying black people
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:14.800]  weren't human then they said black people were two thirds human then they said they were human
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:20.800]  and separate but equal you know what here's the deal scum hitler could pass laws saying
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:27.040]  he was the supreme ruler i'm not following him and the federal government can run around and
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:31.680]  pay preachers off to tell folks go to the camp take your inoculations i mean i played you a
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:36.800]  newscast and the preachers are saying when it's time to go to the camp i tell you to do it it's
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:42.320]  of jesus no it's not of jesus jesus didn't follow what the government said to do and they they
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:48.720]  crucified him all the prophets did they throw daniel in the lion's den because he was licking the
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:53.600]  king's boots what about the folks going to the fiery furnace what about john the baptist did
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:08:00.880]  heron cut his head off because he was following his orders hitler's favorite verse broadcast
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:07.920]  daily on the radio was roman's 13 and german christians just said howl hitler i mean totally
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:17.440]  taken out of context how creepy is it that the federal government for at least six seven years
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:22.800]  has been covertly training preachers to spy on their flocks and tell them to submit to government
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:29.200]  including turn their guns in go to camps and take shots and these same christians say that rick
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:36.000]  perry is the second coming of christ uh even though he's a porno shop investor and everything else
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.800]  although that's confirmed got an expense account stuff that came out i didn't believe it when i saw
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:48.880]  it i went and looked it up for a special type of burlesque shows with men dressed as women but
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:54.160]  you know at the end of the day whatever whatever's going on his personal life that isn't really my
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:09:00.160]  issue my issue is he's told little girls it's the law you got to take a shot when it wasn't the law
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:07.280]  it was a hoax and he was paid by the company his chief of staff and others got out there and told
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:12.320]  the public hey it's the law you got to take this and rick perry came out and said it's the law you
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:16.800]  got to take it when they knew it was an experimental shot that had been killing people on the trials
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:22.320]  that they couldn't get approval for unless it became government mandated i mean that's a new
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:28.800]  level of evil but hey you want to be conned and manipulated you think it's of the lord to worship
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:34.640]  petler stalling i mean whatever government's put above you it's of god i thought it's we the people
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:40.000]  i thought we were the sovereign i thought we were the government oh but you heard the newscast the
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.920]  preacher says we got to deal with the government's biggest problem the people their biggest enemy
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:51.600]  but but but that's actually true the government is run by a collection of special interests
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:57.600]  who were totally ruthless and will put dictators in over third world countries to to rob the public
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:01.680]  do you think they'll do that here you better believe it but but not a dictator of a single
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:08.640]  president but of a system and of the private contractors that feed off of it so this article
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:13.280]  is the top story at info wars.com i hope you get it out to everybody ron paul they're setting the
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:20.560]  stage for violence in this country they're going to shut the economy off the people are gonna get
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:27.120]  angry folks that have their pensions cut people that have their farms taken oh i got another
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:34.720]  report on that usda signs mo you memo of understanding with rockfeller council of
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:41.600]  foundations to exploit rural america and to deploy the us army and homeland security as the new green
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:49.120]  police and they openly admit it's agenda 21 of the un people that don't know about the gen 21
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:54.800]  i've been talking about it for 15 years and now uh becks talked about it some and that's good
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:59.200]  they think we're making it up you know when they tried to pass that food safety act written by big
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:06.320]  pharma and agra to shut down their competition last year uh it actually said this this this law
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:14.080]  adopts the entire treaty of codex alimentarius which is part of agenda 21 i mean you talk about
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:20.720]  total control stalin shut down the farms and ranches ranches out there raising cattle in russia
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:33.200]  Ukraine balarus poland the dairies the rest of it i mean every if you study the soviets are you
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:40.160]  study any other authoritarian system it's a carbon copy they are following it like a roadmap and
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:44.640]  people are like well obama we're going to kick him out he's got low approval ratings
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:48.720]  you know major studies out show he's probably going to lose the election it doesn't matter
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:53.360]  you think the next person who's gone through their whole career selling out the system
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:59.040]  do you think the next person of its mit romney or or or uh one of these people
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:05.440]  rick do you really think they're going to change anything no that's why they're all going after
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:10.400]  ron paul and demonizing him when they're not ignoring him because they're scared because
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:14.000]  they know ron paul's real ladies and gentlemen he predicted everything that's now happening
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:19.200]  wasn't hard to predict it when they told the banks in 99 you can now issue of your part of the big
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:26.080]  six unlimited fake counterfeit instruments and they bought up everything with it and then when
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:32.400]  it all went bankrupt they kept the profits they privatized the profits and said here here you pay
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:39.680]  for it socialize the risk and they bankroll all the candidates perry's bank rolled by the big banks
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:43.600]  well he talks about getting rid of the federal reserve because he knows how popular it is and
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:50.000]  that's the positive sign we've gotten the point now that rick perry who is a political chameleon
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:56.720]  a shape shifter is is talking about oh i'm rooting tooting yosemite sam i want to succeed
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:03.680]  and i want to i'm shooting codes out in westley yeah right there's no dead body but i did it i'm
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:11.920]  rooting tooting tough when i'm not uh anyways uh now he's like i get rid of that federal reserve
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:14.800]  you don't print money to laugh at the election you traitors
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:22.160]  now now let's finish up and come back with break uh with your calls let's finish up with a with a
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:29.760]  bill moyer's report from pbs back in the 1980s on iran contra and the fact that there was a plan to
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:38.640]  stir up riots in america and set up martial law but that plan got nipped in the bud because congress
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:43.120]  blew the whistle and here's congressman jack brooks being told to shut up when he asked oliver north
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:49.440]  about it here's the clip again was elected to the presidency he installed lewis geofreeda as head of
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:57.600]  fema the federal emergency management agency geofreeda was an old cold warrior from reagan's
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:05.440]  california days whose specialty was suppression of unrest and dissent geofreeda north and george
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:12.240]  bush began to turn fema into an instrument of domestic anti-terrorism you're dealing with a
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:17.680]  group of people in the reagan administration who equated political dissent with treason and
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:23.680]  connect differentiate between emergency procedures which i think everyone agrees are necessary
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:30.400]  and suppressant political dissent and with north and poindexter and casey you had a group of people
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:36.800]  who saw americans who disagree with them there's the enemy carl north in your work at the uh
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:42.960]  nsc well you're not assigned at one time to work on plans for the continuity of government in the
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:53.120]  event of a major disaster mr chairman i believe that question touches upon a highly sensitive and
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:15:02.960]  classified area so may i request that you're not touched upon that sir i was particularly concerned
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:11.440]  mr chairman because i read in miami papers and several others that there had been a plan
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:21.760]  developed by that same agency a contingency plan in the event of emergency that would suspend the
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:26.560]  american constitution and i was deeply concerned about it and wondered if that was the area in
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:33.280]  which he had worked i believe we are more wondering if i most respectfully request that that matter
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:39.600]  not be touched upon at this stage if we wish to get into this uncertain arrangements can be made
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:45.680]  for an executive session all right tragically the end of member who got close oh let's finish up
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:53.920]  with hendry began solace by the chairman yeah uh now see there's a lot of delusional people out there
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:57.680]  that say hey you crazy shouldn't be so concerned about tyranny
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:07.280]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:12.880]  to not relive history is it finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath

[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:25.360]  calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention

[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:37.760]  to my foam road to tyranny it was the founding fathers that said even if you try to defend
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:43.680]  liberty even if you do everything you can it's very hard to keep it because corrupt groups form
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:50.880]  insiders get control they grow the size of government to expand their power that's the
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:56.080]  big threat of government is that it empowers the mega corporations and that's now happened
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:04.400]  and somehow they convinced americans to hate what made america so great not trusting government
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:10.640]  keeping it small being fiercely independent i saw a news report last night in fact i meant to print

[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:35.440]  up the newscast in dallas i think it was uh earn and learn that said it's called earn and learn
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.320]  and you get 20 bucks or 40 bucks when you turn somebody in for skipping school

[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:40.080]  the air um you have been warned we're going into tyranny we're going into depression uh of course
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:44.720]  there's a giant fema camp civil emergency program and i've been to the urban warfare drills they
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:49.440]  trained to put americans in camps and then you get concerned about it they say shut up crazy man
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:54.640]  hey you know the banks are imploding our economy by design they're going to set up a bank of the
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:23:03.840]  world shut up crazy man now it's all been announced and how did i know all this why was i so right
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:09.920]  because they all write white papers i bring them here to you this is this is not my opinion i'm not
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:16.240]  predicting the future i'm i'm reporting on what they've said their program is their plan their
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:20.640]  rollout now i don't know exactly when they're going to roll out certain parts of it but they've
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:26.160]  told us their rollout plan joe and mississippi thanks for holding you're on the air go ahead
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:31.760]  hey alex thanks for taking my call thank you sir what do you think about uh ron paul saying
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:36.640]  folks ask him here you worried about fema camps absolutely they want to stage a crisis
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:43.280]  i think if we don't elect one paul word we're in deep deep trouble and we're already in deep
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:52.160]  deep trouble but it seems like uh... you know uh the massive people pretty much everybody i know
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:59.760]  supports liberty and um if if uh... what do you think of obama legalizing all the deportees
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:04.080]  even though it violates federal law you just i mean more and more he's our supreme ruler
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:12.080]  well it seems like to me that we're pretty much annoying little ants to them i mean they
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:18.880]  they could care less about us exactly but here's the issue as unconstitutional as bill clinton was
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:27.040]  or george bush i mean under obama it is going into warp speed and notice the republican leadership
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:30.960]  is not saying a word because they're all bought and paid for by the same interest
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:38.400]  we have a super congress now that creates the bills i mean that that's never been in our history
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:44.080]  they i mean we're in the middle of a takeover what's on your mind joe i'm gonna stop talking at you
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:49.120]  what you're calling about it's it's just crazy this there's so many things that uh you know i
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:54.560]  go over with you but i know our time is limited so um you know i woke up uh probably about three
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:25:00.080]  years ago now and the first time i saw your show i heard you i was um looking at an interview for
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:06.080]  jesse ventura and um i was like uh you know that's kind of crazy but i saw how passionate you were
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:11.600]  and i could tell that you were you know at least you believed it so i was like well he's wasting
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:16.400]  a lot of time and energy you know putting all this out there so there's got to be something to it
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:21.200]  anyway i went to urban warfare drills and watched the military train to break up our families and
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:28.400]  put us in camps this is all 100 real so shouldn't i get upset witnessing things like that definitely
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:34.800]  and i think i think that uh is is actually helpful the thing is that i know for me and people like
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:42.000]  me that aren't awake or that you know that aren't awake yet this stuff is really out there uh and
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:48.880]  it's only because listen when americans were informed about the world everybody basically sounded
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:55.520]  like alex jones go study history americans bought this fake hollywood football thing they think all
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:26:02.320]  this new fake stuff is what america's always been and so that's why now we're losing all the blessings
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:08.480]  we're losing all the prosperity because the average man is not a man you talk to the average man they
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:14.720]  think it's weird if you know legislation numbers i'm sorry go ahead because i've always been
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:19.920]  politically i try to you know make myself pay attention to all these dry political things
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:25.840]  and uh you know once i saw what you were saying i started connecting the dots and what really i
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:30.880]  think started waking me up was whenever the guy got tased down in florida you know don't tase me bro
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:38.880]  guy yeah he wasn't even resisting they tackled him you know and kary said kary said don't arrest him
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:43.760]  he hadn't done anything the guy says i'm leaving they tackle him and tase him for the enjoyment
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:50.560]  you're witnessing evil i'm sorry go ahead yeah i mean it's just been crazy to me and that's what
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:59.440]  really um was a switch for me i think um just looking into that and um what what i want to know
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:07.280]  is is um i mean what would you do if you were starting at ground zero um you know with with no
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:13.840]  gun no gold or silver or any of that you know we got a we got a bunch of trouble coming our way it's
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:17.680]  easy i would just every time you're at the grocery store buy a little extra food you put aside in a
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:25.760]  few months it'll be a hoard and i would get a um shotgun uh you know regular barrel length uh
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:35.200]  $300 inexpensive winchester defender pump shotgun and i'd have slugs and buckshot um and then also
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:41.120]  some birdshot if you needed to hunt for squirrels and such and uh then i would just reach out to
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:44.960]  their friends family and neighbors and try to educate them none of us have to save the world

[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:12.240]  i respect your time and a quick question i called you back in may um i made the mistake of using
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:17.200]  a work email to send to a radio station i don't know if you remember but they played my uh
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:22.880]  or they read my email over the air and it almost got me fired and i have a good job i did
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:28.960]  pays me good and okay so you got a bunch of you got a bunch of control freaks that work around you
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:33.920]  who think people that have views that they don't like are bad and they think they protect america
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:38.480]  by shutting down dissent and instead they're destroying their future yeah and i totally
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:43.280]  disrespect the dj because he's the one that read it knowing he knows our company it's a well-known
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:47.680]  company i'm not gonna say the name but the head of hr called me a conspiracy theorist and but she
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:52.800]  said it in a respectful way she said that's fine you know everybody now when the tsa grabs your
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:57.680]  genitals and you don't like it they call you a conspiracy theorist oh we're taking your farm
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:02.560]  for no reason i don't like that your conspiracy theorist it's just a word it doesn't work anymore
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:08.320]  but don i'm gonna jump quick what's your point today uh well my point was ron paul everybody
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:12.400]  please if you can send five bucks ten bucks whatever you can send a ron paul please do it
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:17.920]  and my my question for you was uh they had something about uh it's important ron paul
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:25.040]  getting a list instead of republican lists can i actually get a list of uh uh dedicated republicans
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:31.360]  to to knock on their door i heard that yes yes no they have lists uh at the county republican
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:36.320]  party level and it varies state to state but you can you can get those done by the way he
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:46.320]  he raised 1.65 million or 1 million 600 000 plus even though there was a cyber attack
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:53.680]  confirmed cyber attack on ron paul uh 2012 website uh even though they shut the website down for
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:59.680]  about six hours and it was a confirmed cyber attack he did raise a lot of money so that's
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:05.680]  very exciting thank you so much don and again ron paul isn't going to save us he's just one
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:12.800]  torpedo in the war against the globalist resistance is going to save us asking god to lead god to
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:19.360]  direct us and i'm serious people laugh about god oh god we are what a nut we're living on a planet
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:24.560]  in the middle of a beautiful universe look at all the wonderment around us whether you believe it to
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:31.520]  be your inner voice or whatever the case is sit in a room spend a few minutes every day thinking
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:37.200]  about the state of the world and ask god to lead god and direct you and you'll see amazing things
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:41.360]  happen in your life you're not going to find god in these mainline government paid for churches
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:48.880]  most of them you're going to find god by seeking god in your spirit and there are no atheists in
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:55.280]  foxholes and we're in a foxhole right now this country is under globalist attack and at the
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:38:00.080]  end of the day i'm going to tell you right now it's about praying to god i know that's where i get my
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:07.280]  strength my perseverance my lack of fear from is directly beamed i can feel the spirit of god
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:13.440]  all around me and i just feel sorry for the lost souls who can't feel it who can't see it
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:20.160]  um all right now i'm pontificating i apologize uh reina reina in maryland you're on the air go
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:28.480]  ahead hi alex um i have a question well one we supported ron paul last night and we gave him
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:35.200]  some good birthday presents but our question is we have a seven month old son who hasn't had
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:40.080]  any vaccination since he was two months and it may be a personal question but we're wondering
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:47.040]  what you do with your children my children have never had a needle in their body absolutely zero
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:52.240]  and all the other children i know that do get all the vaccines quite frankly act like they're
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:57.760]  mildly retarded and look completely unhealthy my children hardly ever get sick and bounce off the
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:04.880]  walls like ping pong balls and seethe with energy and their eyes burn with the electric light of
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:11.280]  creativity just like old timers eyes do in those old black and white you know family films you see
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:18.160]  so no my um my family has not been put under the globalist injector and it's not that i don't
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:24.560]  believe in the science of inoculation i know it's real i've interviewed so many hundreds of top
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:30.960]  scientists over the years who document that the vaccines are intentionally contaminated
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:35.760]  if you don't believe me just type in polio vaccine contaminated with cancer virus or
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:45.520]  eight or or uh Gardasil shot kills girls or un gives children live polio every year in every
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:50.720]  major country it's an accident they give them a live polio and kill them better than a hammer
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:56.240]  it's an accident like hitler having jews be marched into a dirt ditch and shot in the back
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:03.760]  of the head and uh so you can add the big pharma again Bayer pharmaceutical found guilty in France
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:11.040]  but it was a worldwide program for at least 10 years knew that every ampule of factor eight
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:16.400]  had hiv and hepatitis and they made the conscious decision to ship it out to everybody worldwide
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:23.760]  but you cannot trust anything big pharma does they knew when they got prozac approved in 81
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:28.880]  now the lawsuits have started that it caused massive increases in psychotic activity
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:34.720]  and suicide it's a hallucinogen it's get the insert it's in the hallucinogen class
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:44.400]  it's it's it's a fluoride chlorine molecule i mean a lot of poisons make you feel euphoric
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:49.360]  but when you have a bad trip you cut your baby's arms off every cop i've talked to who pulls up
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:53.920]  to a house with a woman dancing around naked with butcher knives talked to one cop from houston
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:59.280]  about it they knew immediately when they went in her house that this woman up there cutting herself
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:04.240]  they went right to her medicine cabinet every case opened it up serotonin rea take inhibitors
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:11.280]  were all in there i mean it's a hallucinogen you might as well be taking pcp i'm sorry go ahead
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:19.680]  um my question is we're an active duty military family so he's being treated at a military facility
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:27.200]  is there anything what are we allowed to say no to well uh number one when you go to the military
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:34.320]  you waive your rights and you agree to take approved mainline non-experimental standard
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:40.800]  vaccines that's around 36 different injections for an adult but a lot of more combo shots so it
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:51.040]  can be up in the 50s the quote boosters um but you're allowed to stand up for yourself and know
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:56.400]  that they can't give your husband or you any experimental shots but they lie to the military
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:02.960]  and are paid by big pharma to actually use you as guinea pigs now as for your children uh this has
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:08.000]  been fought over and over again if they try to lie to you and say you've got to take shots to be here
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:16.080]  that is official oppression racketeering fraud uh it's a lie there's no law you have to take a shot
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:24.720]  but i had six years ago the and it made national news when i got him on i had the state attorney
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:31.920]  for mariland on one of the state attorneys and they had this this this event where they reported
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:38.560]  2000 children and their parents had to be inoculated to go to school they had dogs barking at them and
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:42.720]  shots and i got him on and i said you never told him there was a waiver and he goes no i didn't
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:47.360]  he started laughing and i go do you inoculate your kids started laughing he said no i don't
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:53.360]  inoculate him he thought it was cute that they lied and said it was the law he thought it was cute
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:58.240]  his kids don't take it see that's what these people are psychopaths we'll be right back with more calls

[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:56.000]  hey alex just had to ask your advice about something okay well basically uh i'm sure that
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:03.280]  you're aware of the weekend of september 11th it's going to be uh a lot of propaganda at football
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:08.960]  stands across the nation uh high school college and professional oh by the way it's being reported
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:15.120]  by cnn no 911 first responders are allowed the actual heroes of 911 because they're all angry
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:21.040]  about the asbestos and the government knowingly lying to them that's how evil this government is
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:26.880]  and they're going to use those heroes uh to make themselves look like heroes but the heroes aren't
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:34.400]  allowed to be there yes that's that's disgusting well pretty much i play football here at uh
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:40.160]  college in california and i was looking for a way to protest uh because i have a feeling they're
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:46.080]  going to be bringing out the military and uh spouting off about terrorists and the day the
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:53.760]  world changed and all this and something i could do maybe a sit down or wow i tell you i tell you
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:58.080]  i could talk for hours with you about different ideas uh i would do something like
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:07.040]  print off a few thousand flyers with basic 911 facts uh the smoking guns of 911 that's a good
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:12.320]  thing to search and pull up those 300 smoking guns and point out that they're now rebranding
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:18.400]  terrorism to domestic groups i'd print off a bunch of copies and uh a fox news and ap that
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:25.520]  that the number three in al-qaeda secretly works for the pentagon that's what i do feel i would um
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:33.040]  i would uh just point out that that regardless of what you think about 911 it's been used to
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:41.200]  take our freedoms away and that 911 shouldn't be a tool to kill america yeah i agree actually
[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:47.040]  the one thing it is going to be hard i as i am uh going to be going through drills and everything
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:53.440]  on the field um i'd like to get out but i'm i'm only uh i'm i'm restricted to what i can do well
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:59.680]  do this do this just just get a good 911 documentary and make 20 copies and give it 20 people you
[01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:04.240]  don't have to save the world by yourself it's little things that build up the big things phil
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:10.080]  i appreciate your call let's talk to justin in missouri justin you're on the air go ahead
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:16.880]  hey thanks for taking my call yes sir i just wanted to everybody's talking about ron paul and
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:22.160]  i and you know i agree we need to get him in office but everybody needs to realize also that
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:26.720]  we need to put some people in the congress and to send it to back him up as well because that
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:32.560]  happens in that election cycle as well hey listen the federal reserve is incredibly unpopular in
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:37.760]  every poll now uh rick perry's having to act like he's anti-federal reserve to try to get elected
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:43.360]  look at how far we've come ron paul ran paul they're only a manifestation i agree everyone should run
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:51.120]  run on the ideas of liberty articulated by ron paul and it's a winning formula we just and even
[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:56.080]  if you don't win the first time you're going to educate people in those debates in those interviews
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:03.520]  whether it's city council water district state legislature just do it yeah and but but i mean
[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:08.560]  the people as well to vote some like-minded folks into the senate and the congress to help them
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:15.200]  and you know because as you said before one guy can't do it all well one guy can't but again going
[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:20.880]  back to what i'm saying how big a manifestation is it of liberty that he was an underdog candidate
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:26.640]  three and a half years ago and now anyway you slice it even ap's on analysis agrees so it is
[01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:32.400]  the pure research that he is number one or number two i mean he really is the front runner right now
[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:38.560]  he is the front runner even with the media trying to ignore him that shows us how far we've come
[01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:44.320]  justin yeah and i've been calling my local shows here in st lewis and it's like every time i tell
[01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:48.320]  him i want to talk about ron paul and rick perry it's like i wait two hours and the show ends and
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:53.920]  they never come to me well i'm telling you you can you can call in about another political
[01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:57.920]  issue and then bring up what you want once you get on air this whole call screening business
[01:51:57.920 --> 01:52:05.200]  i only screen calls when we've got a specific topic and uh there is a talking point out there
[01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:11.520]  to attack ron paul most these local talk show hosts are not government agents they're weak-minded
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:18.240]  idiots who think if they regurgitate what cnn and fox news say that makes them sound real good no
[01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:23.200]  we're not talking about ron paul while we look at other candidates because he can't win we say so
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:31.040]  so that's disgusting let's go ahead and talk to sky in washington sky you're on the air
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:36.480]  hi alex i'm on the we're talking about femus i want to talk about this border patrol situation
[01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:43.280]  going on up here by the border there uh had like four agents over in port angeles that's
[01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:49.840]  kind of near the coast in washington and now they got it up to 40 and even the the people that
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:54.640]  worked there there was one agent who came out and public public and said we're not doing anything
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:58.720]  besides driving around and trying to make work for us because they're responding to everything
[01:52:58.720 --> 01:53:04.880]  from bank robberies to domestic uh violent situations and trailer park no no i saw those
[01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:10.320]  articles all over the northern border and of course you're uh up there in washington right
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:16.320]  on the canadian border all over the canadian border they're sending the border patrol to
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:21.600]  regular events and they're building a fence up there in many areas instead of doing it the south
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:26.400]  where it's needed because they don't want americans to get out during a depression they're locking the
[01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:32.720]  country down where you can't get out you can just get in and so that's what's going on and and look
[01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:37.120]  i've got an article right here out of cbs news where they just calmly report yeah the air force
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:46.800]  helped rob excuse me fraudian slip helped raid a uh gun shop uh and again i see articles every two
[01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:55.440]  days now where marines respond to robbery uh marines army running checkpoints 10 miles from base
[01:53:56.080 --> 01:54:01.200]  and they're just it's totally illegal but it's illegal for obama to be launching wars without
[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:06.800]  congressional approval i mean it's very scary sky well they're also working with the local
[01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:12.720]  police departments in this program called operation stone garden it's a FEMA program or something
[01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:17.120]  to try to i don't know what they're doing with really with the local sir they've come in with
[01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:21.360]  federal money that was taken from the stage to begin with they've set up threat fusion centers
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:25.840]  and i've gotten training videos from inside i've i've aired them it's been national news
[01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:31.440]  and all they do is talk about in the fetters get us out of the u-inners anti-globalists and how
[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:37.280]  evil veterans are i mean they actually with a straight face none of this has to do with al-qaeda
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:40.960]  even if you believe the fairy tale about bin laden and the fairy all of this stuff
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:47.040]  the whole thing is about americans that don't want foreign banks coming in like we're a third
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:52.240]  role country and taking us over okay it's simple we're being conquered i appreciate your call
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:58.880]  tim in connecticut you're on the air go ahead hi alex thanks for taking my call thank you um i'm
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:03.760]  a us navy veteran and i got out the early 90s and i have a homery modeling business here in
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:10.000]  connecticut and about three three and a half years ago i worked for a white house staffer who i
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.240]  really don't want to get anybody in trouble i don't want to see their name but after they found out
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:19.520]  i was a us navy veteran they slowly confided in me for about you know a year on and off that i
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:27.680]  worked there and they told me i was informed that yes there is a plan for martial law in the united
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:35.360]  states and not only that that we will see united nations troops in our streets and this is right
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:44.480]  when obama was running for uh when he was uh well by the way new listeners just tuned in uh i was
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:48.320]  first told this by generals and kernels we interviewed who were retired who went to events
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:54.240]  and and and these speeches were given but now it's official uh in leo nine fema put out a press
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:56:00.560]  release just type in leo nine that 14 countries are prepared to enter the us for several emergencies
[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:05.840]  including mexican and canadian troops and then they use quote us troops in canada for the olympic
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:13.120]  so yes sir what they were confiding in you is is public see that's what's crazy this is all public
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:17.920]  they're just counting on the general population not going and looking this up and again they're
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:23.360]  doing it because the banks have taken us over they got their people in all the positions of power
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:28.240]  and then had our government sign on to their debt you understand that and one of the other things
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:33.520]  one of the other issues i used to bring up every time i said obama they said tim it's not obama
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:39.840]  it's rough child they are in control of all of it it's the rough child family they don't
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:44.000]  most scream it in my face at times it gets so frustrated because you know i'm always searching
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:51.040]  for answers and they give me limited information and let me read things and then you can't take it
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:57.040]  with you but we just want you to know so so they seem tortured by this i you know i talked to a very
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:01.920]  well known doctor i'm just going to leave that alone that they've been on the show but i won't
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:09.280]  say their name in association with it and they were told by a head of state in europe a major
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:16.480]  head of state a woman not hard to figure out who that that she's very sad about the fact
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:20.160]  that once the world government's in place that they're going to release a bio weapon and kill
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:24.880]  most of us but that's just what's going to happen ladies and gentlemen this isn't a game
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:31.760]  once their world government's in place once it's in place all of you police all of you people that
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:36.320]  have served the system you are not going to believe what happens to you while you're there
