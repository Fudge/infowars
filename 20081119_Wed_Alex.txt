[00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:06.329]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.329 --> 00:00:08.090]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.851]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.851 --> 00:00:11.433]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:12.333]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:17.177]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.177 --> 00:00:21.261]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.063 --> 00:00:37.465]  sports writer joining us in about two hours who just got involved in mainline politics and was tracked and traced by Homeland Security, the state police.
[00:00:37.465 --> 00:00:48.568]  I want to give you an idea of just how rogue, just how classically out-of-control, uh, wicked the government is today with the guest.
[00:00:48.568 --> 00:00:50.808]  We'll tell you about him a little bit later.
[00:00:50.808 --> 00:00:54.649]  Also, we have Professor Stephen Jones of physics,
[00:00:56.115 --> 00:00:59.017]  Joining us along with David Ray Griffin together.
[00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:02.059]  Thought that'd be interesting to have the two on together.
[00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.961]  Coming up in the fourth hour today.
[00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:15.169]  I was originally going to have them both on because I was going to have a TV channel here.
[00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:23.454]  The folks from National Geographic, but I decided not to do it because I learned the type of programs the producers made are just so one-sided.
[00:01:23.454 --> 00:01:24.155]  There's no point.
[00:01:25.371 --> 00:01:29.094]  To even be part of it, because they're being interviewed as well.
[00:01:29.094 --> 00:01:32.436]  And so I thought it would be a nice tie-in, but we're not doing that.
[00:01:32.436 --> 00:01:35.237]  I think they're still being interviewed by him.
[00:01:35.237 --> 00:01:38.219]  But they are coming up in the fourth hour today.
[00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:45.844]  A lot of important news we'll be covering in the meantime, and open phones.
[00:01:45.844 --> 00:01:51.888]  A toll-free number to join us on air on any issue you wish to discuss, any news item, the economy,
[00:01:53.047 --> 00:02:10.331]  Barack Hussein Obama, the way he is, well, saying that it's official, they're gonna have Hillary Clinton as the Secretary of State, Bush-Clinton, Bush-Clinton, on and on forever.
[00:02:10.331 --> 00:02:15.132]  And he's appointing, again, all these other New World Order insiders.
[00:02:16.414 --> 00:02:19.836]  So things are going to get even worse.
[00:02:19.836 --> 00:02:26.419]  If you didn't think that was possible, hold on to your seat because it is going to get more serious.
[00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:38.984]  I'm actually getting a lot of Obama minions who were hoping for something new, who hated Bush so much and didn't realize that he was a total puppet, and didn't realize that Obama would be a puppet.
[00:02:38.984 --> 00:02:40.625]  I am getting emails and calls and
[00:02:41.556 --> 00:02:49.641]  Quite a few comments on the message board up on PrisonPlanet.com as well as in the stories on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:58.747]  People saying, yeah, you were right, my gosh, he really has completely betrayed the people.
[00:02:58.747 --> 00:03:03.350]  Well, of course, I mean, he said nine, ten months ago he was against the war.
[00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.811]  Now he's saying we'll be there at least three more years.
[00:03:05.811 --> 00:03:06.692]  That's the Bush Doctrine.
[00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:13.537]  Uh, warrantless wiretapping of the American people, that continues, torture.
[00:03:13.537 --> 00:03:18.982]  All the policies, except a few new ones that Bush did sign on to in the last two years.
[00:03:18.982 --> 00:03:27.290]  Carbon taxes, regulating every facet of your life, more gun control, more amnesty, more open borders, more taxes.
[00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.795]  Now at this point, I mean, I'm not for raising taxes to quote, pay down the deficit, because
[00:03:34.108 --> 00:03:36.430]  There's no putting Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.834]  The currency will be devalued.
[00:03:40.834 --> 00:03:43.657]  There is no putting the dollar back together again.
[00:03:43.657 --> 00:03:53.967]  Taxes are only to squeeze the economy into oblivion that much faster so it can be vertically integrated, consolidated by the multinational banks.
[00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:59.732]  So taxes are only used as a weapon when you have an economy this irrevocably bankrupt.
[00:04:00.405 --> 00:04:04.906]  And unsalvageable to brutalize the middle class.
[00:04:04.906 --> 00:04:11.768]  And by middle class, I mean people making $100,000 a year up to $50 million a year.
[00:04:11.768 --> 00:04:15.709]  That is the lower middle class up to the nouveau riche.
[00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:22.231]  I know the poor blue-collar folks have been taught by Hollywood and TV that somebody making $80,000 a year is rich.
[00:04:22.231 --> 00:04:24.472]  That is not the case.
[00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:25.872]  These are economies of scale.
[00:04:25.872 --> 00:04:28.833]  I mean, there are thousands of
[00:04:31.127 --> 00:04:34.908]  Billionaires, ladies and gentlemen, they're just good at hiding their assets.
[00:04:34.908 --> 00:04:38.069]  There are just untold masses of millionaires.
[00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:41.870]  And it ain't what it used to be, as they say.
[00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.791]  So I want to take a lot of calls today at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:43.791 --> 00:04:48.432]  Got a lot of interesting news.
[00:04:48.432 --> 00:04:52.253]  Some of it is very encouraging.
[00:04:52.253 --> 00:04:54.974]  We will talk about it all on the other side.
[00:04:54.974 --> 00:04:57.175]  Some amazing medical breakthroughs.
[00:04:57.175 --> 00:04:57.635]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.609 --> 00:05:02.271]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:02.271 --> 00:05:07.018]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:05:07.018 --> 00:05:09.981]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:05:09.981 --> 00:05:13.046]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:17.772]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:05:17.972 --> 00:05:19.153]  If you simply prepare.
[00:05:19.153 --> 00:05:22.898]  Our elective representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for the special interest.
[00:05:22.898 --> 00:05:24.960]  So they ignored your screams not to do it.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.782]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[00:05:26.782 --> 00:05:30.767]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[00:05:30.767 --> 00:05:33.190]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:42.720]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food, beyond many Americans' reach.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:49.809]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days, until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:51.811]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast,
[00:05:52.031 --> 00:05:54.231]  There seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[00:05:54.231 --> 00:05:59.933]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[00:05:59.933 --> 00:06:03.173]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[00:06:03.173 --> 00:06:06.534]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[00:06:06.534 --> 00:06:08.354]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[00:06:08.354 --> 00:06:12.415]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[00:06:12.415 --> 00:06:14.856]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared.
[00:06:14.856 --> 00:06:15.696]  Get self-sufficient.
[00:06:15.876 --> 00:06:16.536]  Get food.
[00:06:16.536 --> 00:06:24.081]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the New World Order, has a lot less control over you.
[00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:25.281]  And so it's a mindset.
[00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:28.023]  A mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[00:06:28.023 --> 00:06:31.264]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:06:31.264 --> 00:06:38.248]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:06:38.248 --> 00:06:41.330]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.674]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:06:46.674 --> 00:06:52.940]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, freeze-dried, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.703]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:56.703 --> 00:06:57.984]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:06:57.984 --> 00:06:58.685]  Take action today.
[00:06:58.685 --> 00:07:00.506]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:17.797]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:07:17.797 --> 00:07:19.358]  You want answers?
[00:07:19.358 --> 00:07:20.939]  Well, so does he.
[00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:25.123]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:25.123 --> 00:07:29.686]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:07:29.686 --> 00:07:41.676]  Jack, Igor, Tony, Ted, Chris, I'm going to you in this segment.
[00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:45.150]  Wide open phones today.
[00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.834]  I got a lot of important audio clips I want to play and break down.
[00:07:49.834 --> 00:07:54.138]  Professor Stephen Jones and David Ray Griffin join us later.
[00:07:54.138 --> 00:08:06.168]  And we also again have a very well-known sports commentator, David Zurin, will be joining us as well coming up in T-minus one hour and 51 minutes.
[00:08:06.168 --> 00:08:11.353]  We're going to have open phones up until then and cover the news.
[00:08:12.595 --> 00:08:14.916]  In economic developments, U.S.
[00:08:14.916 --> 00:08:18.698]  home construction sinks to new record low.
[00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:19.679]  Construction of U.S.
[00:08:19.679 --> 00:08:25.642]  homes falls 4.5% to new record low in October as builders cut back.
[00:08:25.642 --> 00:08:33.586]  Construction of new homes plunged 4.5% last month to the lowest level on government records dating back to 1959 as U.S.
[00:08:33.586 --> 00:08:36.928]  builders slashed production while Wall Street nosedived.
[00:08:37.432 --> 00:08:43.237]  Building permits, a barometer for future activity, also plummeted to a new record low pace.
[00:08:43.237 --> 00:08:53.126]  The embattled housing industry, which enjoyed a five-year boom, is now on pace to construct the fewest new homes and apartments since the end of World War II.
[00:08:55.851 --> 00:09:02.457]  Also, charts predict Dow Jones Industrial Average to hit 6,400 in less than a month.
[00:09:02.457 --> 00:09:06.580]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average is set to sink to 6,400 within the next few weeks.
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:17.269]  Nicole Elliott, Technical Analyst for Muzo Corporate Bank, told CNBC, any moment now, I think we're going to break lower, Elliott told Europe Tonight.
[00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:18.110]  I think this
[00:09:19.285 --> 00:09:22.666]  Is to be possible before the end of November or very early December.
[00:09:22.666 --> 00:09:30.029]  I mean, we're almost on our way now, and it's just a question of how far down do we go, she said.
[00:09:30.029 --> 00:09:46.134]  In other financial news, I watched clips last night of the multi, it was a three or four hour testimony of Henry Paulson, the guy running the Treasury Department, the Goldman Sachs crime boss, and the private Fed head, Ben Bernanke,
[00:09:47.342 --> 00:09:50.524]  And he arrogantly chastised Congress.
[00:09:50.524 --> 00:09:57.668]  Every time he would speak, or Bernanke would speak, Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, CNBC would put him on.
[00:09:57.668 --> 00:10:06.533]  Every time Ron Paul or others on the banking committee in the House would hammer them, they would just cut away.
[00:10:06.533 --> 00:10:09.895]  So you had to go up to the C-SPAN website or the C-SPAN channels to watch it.
[00:10:09.895 --> 00:10:11.676]  It's another example.
[00:10:11.676 --> 00:10:15.878]  I mean, these big banks and brokerage firms, they own the controlling stock.
[00:10:17.256 --> 00:10:21.978]  In those TV networks, and they're not going to let you know what's going on.
[00:10:21.978 --> 00:10:34.044]  By the way, I've seen scores of news articles as they get the public ready to go after the pension funds, and as they prepare the public to have their 401Ks taken.
[00:10:34.044 --> 00:10:38.627]  And, you know, I tell people this on the street.
[00:10:38.627 --> 00:10:43.529]  I was in a restaurant last night, and there were some nice folks talking to me, but some other people were kind of laughing at me.
[00:10:45.431 --> 00:10:54.273]  And I was picking food up at the bar for like 10 minutes, you know, waiting there, and I just said, well, what is it I've said that hasn't happened?
[00:10:54.273 --> 00:10:56.494]  Well, I mean, what's funny?
[00:10:56.494 --> 00:10:57.914]  What's funny about all of this?
[00:10:57.914 --> 00:11:03.035]  I mean, it's not funny.
[00:11:03.035 --> 00:11:06.796]  And having your pension funds taken isn't funny.
[00:11:06.796 --> 00:11:14.638]  But we're a nation of arrogant know-it-alls, and the average individual is so arrogant
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.062]  That they can't even imagine bad things happening to them.
[00:11:19.062 --> 00:11:23.603]  Let me tell you, it's going to be that much worse when people find out what's been done to them.
[00:11:23.603 --> 00:11:29.206]  I mean, you think people are mad now about five trillion stolen in five weeks by the private banks?
[00:11:29.206 --> 00:11:30.566]  Just imagine.
[00:11:30.566 --> 00:11:32.127]  But, uh, watching Paulson.
[00:11:32.127 --> 00:11:39.030]  Paulson warns TARP isn't panacea for economies' ills.
[00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:43.412]  And it goes on in Bloomberg, talking about how he, uh, chastised the Congress like they were bad.
[00:11:44.648 --> 00:11:46.129]  Truly disgusting.
[00:11:46.129 --> 00:11:49.792]  Obama pushes a carbon tax proposal that would inflict a new Great Depression.
[00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:56.178]  They had a big speech out in California last night about how they're gonna bankrupt this and bankrupt that.
[00:11:56.178 --> 00:11:57.899]  Oh, that's really gonna help you, America.
[00:11:57.899 --> 00:12:05.145]  Let me explain something to people out there who are posting on theprisonplanet.com a story that Paul Watson wrote, billing you idiots.
[00:12:05.145 --> 00:12:07.647]  You don't understand the true vision of Obama.
[00:12:08.266 --> 00:12:18.031]  You don't understand how this is going to energize a new green revolution and a new 21st century economy.
[00:12:18.031 --> 00:12:23.434]  On and on and on.
[00:12:23.434 --> 00:12:37.001]  Even if they came out with super technologies today, getting them to market, bringing them to 300 million Americans, that conversion would take conservatively five years.
[00:12:39.222 --> 00:12:41.583]  And, you know, we're seeing other technological conversions.
[00:12:41.583 --> 00:12:55.888]  The death of the newspapers, the massive contraction of TV news, not just because they're a pack of lying criminals that no one trusts, but also because people are tuning out, they're tuning into the web.
[00:12:55.888 --> 00:13:02.290]  But we see the establishment moving to block alternative news, logging to regulate, tax and control the web.
[00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:03.910]  So that fight is now shaking up.
[00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:10.892]  We'll see how that unfolds, as that shapes up.
[00:13:10.892 --> 00:13:14.173]  But I digress.
[00:13:14.173 --> 00:13:18.535]  The point here is, have you read the International Agreement, to know it all?
[00:13:18.535 --> 00:13:25.299]  Have you read what the IMF and World Bank, International Bank of Settlements, the OECD?
[00:13:25.299 --> 00:13:30.221]  Have you read what the Club of Rome and Trilateral Commission and CFR are saying this is for?
[00:13:30.221 --> 00:13:33.402]  I mean, we write articles in link to their statements.
[00:13:33.402 --> 00:13:34.983]  Paul Watson's done that in this article.
[00:13:35.788 --> 00:13:37.189]  But do you even read the article?
[00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:37.709]  No.
[00:13:37.709 --> 00:13:38.989]  Do you even read the links?
[00:13:38.989 --> 00:13:39.810]  No.
[00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:43.731]  They say it's about destroying the middle class and vertical integration.
[00:13:43.731 --> 00:13:54.495]  They say it's about freezing growth of the economy and development to control you, because if technology continues to expand, they are going to lose their monopolies.
[00:13:54.495 --> 00:14:00.677]  And you are going to have a revolution of technology and energy and information.
[00:14:00.677 --> 00:14:02.058]  You understand that this system
[00:14:03.052 --> 00:14:09.434]  It will move what's left of our industry, about 20% of what we had in the 70s, the early 70s.
[00:14:09.434 --> 00:14:10.614]  20% is left.
[00:14:10.614 --> 00:14:17.177]  That will move to China and India and Mexico and the hundred and other, 160 plus other countries.
[00:14:17.177 --> 00:14:20.938]  Where there are no carbon caps.
[00:14:20.938 --> 00:14:23.198]  And there's no discussion of them ever having it.
[00:14:23.198 --> 00:14:27.840]  You understand the big banks own and control the big slave factories overseas?
[00:14:29.238 --> 00:14:39.044]  So it's just a cold-blooded, mercantile move to shut down industry here in the United States, in Canada, New Zealand, Australia, England, Western Europe.
[00:14:39.044 --> 00:14:40.845]  I mean, do you understand that?
[00:14:40.845 --> 00:14:42.986]  You understand that?
[00:14:42.986 --> 00:14:44.007]  You understand that?
[00:14:44.007 --> 00:14:47.929]  You understand that even if you believe carbon dioxide is a deadly poison?
[00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.051]  And that methane is horrible and evil, and all the rest of it.
[00:14:54.051 --> 00:15:00.112]  Do you understand that it will only move it to third world nations, and that it will boost the amount?
[00:15:00.112 --> 00:15:03.713]  I mean, the level of wanton ignorance.
[00:15:03.713 --> 00:15:04.894]  But hey, you know what?
[00:15:04.894 --> 00:15:09.375]  Go ahead, parade around, put Obama stickers on your car, call for this, and just enjoy!
[00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:13.316]  And ask yourself if you're better in four or five years than you were today.
[00:15:15.103 --> 00:15:15.764]  But it won't matter.
[00:15:15.764 --> 00:15:18.366]  A lot of you don't even care if you become homeless.
[00:15:18.366 --> 00:15:22.990]  He'll be on TV telling you he loves you and, you know, it's sacrifices we've got to make.
[00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:26.153]  Getting everybody ready for this.
[00:15:26.153 --> 00:15:27.274]  Alright, I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:15:27.274 --> 00:15:28.135]  I'm digressing here.
[00:15:28.135 --> 00:15:31.017]  Just Obama pushes carbon tax proposal.
[00:15:31.017 --> 00:15:34.921]  SEC persecutes Mark Cuban for relationship with loose change.
[00:15:34.921 --> 00:15:40.406]  I said on this show yesterday afternoon, at the end of the show, that
[00:15:41.383 --> 00:15:47.564]  There was a good chance this was persecution for Mark Cuban's involvement with Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:15:47.564 --> 00:15:49.705]  The owner of the Mavericks.
[00:15:49.705 --> 00:15:54.726]  The guy that sold a bunch of stuff to Yahoo for three billion bucks.
[00:15:54.726 --> 00:15:55.726]  I'll talk about that later.
[00:15:55.726 --> 00:16:03.448]  I want to go to some calls first, but um... The New York Times is now saying it looks like that's what it is.
[00:16:03.448 --> 00:16:04.868]  So now I have to reassess things.
[00:16:04.868 --> 00:16:06.808]  Maybe, maybe it isn't for Loose Change.
[00:16:06.808 --> 00:16:09.809]  The New York Times is agreeing with me that it must not be true.
[00:16:10.661 --> 00:16:27.271]  Uh, but, um, they do point out, though, well, if you read the article, the investigation started the month after Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity and others said, we're going to get you, Cuban.
[00:16:27.271 --> 00:16:28.612]  We're going to get you, Sheen.
[00:16:28.612 --> 00:16:29.612]  We're going to ruin you.
[00:16:29.612 --> 00:16:31.013]  You better not do this.
[00:16:31.013 --> 00:16:36.756]  And I know that Charlie Sheen was threatened in ways, if I told you, you wouldn't even believe it, but you saw what was put out in the media.
[00:16:36.756 --> 00:16:37.517]  That was only part of it.
[00:16:38.101 --> 00:16:55.472]  Producers, separate people in Hollywood, were told, just out of the blue, somebody's sister's husband calls up, who's a general in the Air Force, and says, don't be involved, this is a true story, in this movie, or they will kill your children.
[00:16:55.472 --> 00:16:58.413]  And that was before O'Reilly heard about it, it was even on the news.
[00:16:58.413 --> 00:17:00.054]  That's when it was secret.
[00:17:00.054 --> 00:17:01.975]  So that's why that never happened.
[00:17:01.975 --> 00:17:03.296]  Cuban actually pulled out of it.
[00:17:03.296 --> 00:17:04.397]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:17:06.944 --> 00:17:12.767]  SEC lawyer emailed him and said, you know, here I am, I'm gonna report you, we're gonna get you.
[00:17:12.767 --> 00:17:14.388]  And they did get him.
[00:17:14.388 --> 00:17:18.210]  And so I'm being sarcastic about not believing the New York Times thing.
[00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:21.531]  I mean, that is what's going on.
[00:17:21.531 --> 00:17:24.413]  And, you know, I'm committed to be put in prison if they do it.
[00:17:24.413 --> 00:17:27.895]  I mean, for some trumped-up charge.
[00:17:27.895 --> 00:17:30.176]  I'm committed to go ahead and, you know, let that happen.
[00:17:30.176 --> 00:17:34.058]  I'm committed to be killed, or set up, or demonized, or attacked, or gunned down.
[00:17:34.058 --> 00:17:36.319]  I mean, I don't want those things to happen, but
[00:17:38.954 --> 00:17:43.257]  I'm in a position that really nobody else in the, quote, alternative media or patriot movement is.
[00:17:43.257 --> 00:17:46.338]  I mean, I am the big kahuna.
[00:17:46.338 --> 00:17:52.122]  And the sad part about all of this is that, I mean, I'm doing this truly from altruistic aims.
[00:17:52.122 --> 00:17:54.863]  I really know this is a very special journey.
[00:17:54.863 --> 00:17:56.844]  It's like Dennis Kucinich said months ago on the show.
[00:17:56.844 --> 00:17:58.345]  He said, I don't care if they threaten me.
[00:17:58.345 --> 00:17:59.366]  I don't care what happens to me.
[00:17:59.366 --> 00:18:03.348]  This is now a spiritual thing.
[00:18:03.348 --> 00:18:06.450]  By the way, magically, his brother and sister have both died in the last four months.
[00:18:07.392 --> 00:18:08.373]  Very interesting.
[00:18:08.373 --> 00:18:09.193]  They're pretty young.
[00:18:09.193 --> 00:18:11.315]  They're younger than him, magically dying.
[00:18:11.315 --> 00:18:33.832]  But, side issue, the point is that... That's why I wish that other people in this movement would spend more time fighting the New World Order instead of obsessing about Alex Jones and my celebrity that is exponentially growing, because it's a liability for me.
[00:18:33.832 --> 00:18:34.473]  I don't like it.
[00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:38.496]  But I do also see it as a mark of success in getting the word out.
[00:18:38.496 --> 00:18:43.498]  But you have to understand, it's a dangerous thing.
[00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:45.519]  It's a very dark thing.
[00:18:45.519 --> 00:18:52.562]  It's not a, you know, it's a racing on the edge of the abyss, running with the devil, whatever you want to call it.
[00:18:55.566 --> 00:19:08.097]  I mean you should realize that all of us are in danger and especially myself and people should really get their heads screwed on straight and reassess this because you have no idea the type of persecution we go through to bring you this.
[00:19:08.097 --> 00:19:13.001]  Phase one of the insider's plan for a one world government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[00:19:13.001 --> 00:19:20.228]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new world bank to act as savior.
[00:19:20.228 --> 00:19:21.829]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[00:19:22.049 --> 00:19:26.191]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[00:19:26.191 --> 00:19:29.833]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[00:19:29.833 --> 00:19:34.535]  The insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[00:19:34.535 --> 00:19:38.537]  Phase one is a one world currency, which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[00:19:38.537 --> 00:19:42.579]  Phase two of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies.
[00:19:42.979 --> 00:19:47.642]  Go to www.foodshortageusa.com for the details.

[00:20:08.132 --> 00:20:14.906]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:20:14.906 --> 00:20:16.589]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:20:17.518 --> 00:20:19.079]  But who is the enemy?
[00:20:19.079 --> 00:20:19.859]  Bin Laden.
[00:20:19.859 --> 00:20:20.700]  This is his M.O.
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.241]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:20:22.241 --> 00:20:24.242]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:20:24.242 --> 00:20:31.386]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:20:31.386 --> 00:20:31.866]  Some U.S.
[00:20:31.866 --> 00:20:38.210]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:41.672]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:20:41.932 --> 00:20:52.196]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:20:52.196 --> 00:20:53.416]  Fabled enemies.

[00:21:08.905 --> 00:21:11.166]  Holidays are right around the corner.
[00:21:11.166 --> 00:21:18.670]  The crowds, the countless hours in traffic, finding a parking spot just to buy a gift you're worried they might not like anyway.
[00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:23.732]  How about surprising your loved ones with a gift they can use every day of the year?

[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:23.054]  I wish your butt was still silver, it was black.
[00:23:24.051 --> 00:23:51.244]  You gotta be scared of the dumbed down public, because as the bankers implode and consolidate the economy, the public is gonna whine and scream, I predict, instead of getting angry, and say, we'll do whatever you say, we'll attack whatever country you say, we'll give up all our rights, we'll rat out our neighbors, we'll take jobs stealing our neighbors' houses, just give us money, give us cheeseburgers, give us
[00:23:52.364 --> 00:23:53.245]  Yes, Mr. Jones.
[00:23:53.245 --> 00:23:56.026]  I just want to say it's a great honor to be on the air with you.
[00:23:56.026 --> 00:23:56.606]  I'm a regular listener.
[00:24:17.277 --> 00:24:22.919]  I have been after this past summer I made a decision not to listen to Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh.
[00:24:22.919 --> 00:24:36.264]  I have a job that allows me to ride on a lawnmower all day and I have my headphones on and I just got sick of listening to the same old garbage and so I decided to buy some forbidden fruit and got one of those iPods.
[00:24:36.724 --> 00:24:40.229]  I've been listening to your podcast regularly and sharing it with the guys at work.
[00:24:40.229 --> 00:24:47.419]  I subscribed to your Prison Planet TV, got some videos, sharing it with my family.
[00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:52.146]  I just wanted to give a shout out and say hi to the NSA, anybody else who's listening.
[00:24:52.566 --> 00:24:56.187]  I know you're listening, and we know you're a bunch of criminals.
[00:24:56.187 --> 00:24:58.147]  I am in the National Guard.
[00:24:58.147 --> 00:25:06.729]  I took an oath to defend the Constitution, the people of Maine, the people of this country, and I'm going to stick to that.
[00:25:06.729 --> 00:25:13.131]  My weapon is the First Amendment, and I will continue to speak out against all these injustices.
[00:25:13.131 --> 00:25:14.691]  First Amendment's bad!
[00:25:14.691 --> 00:25:15.391]  That's the one!
[00:25:15.391 --> 00:25:16.251]  Hold on!
[00:25:16.251 --> 00:25:18.592]  Osama Bin Laden wrote that First Amendment!
[00:25:19.409 --> 00:25:27.114]  Hey, listen, since you've got a 9-11 show coming today, you know, was it Stephen Jones is on the air?
[00:25:27.114 --> 00:25:27.915]  Yes.
[00:25:27.915 --> 00:25:32.858]  I brought up Glenn Beck and something that just disgusts me that I heard on the air a couple of years ago.
[00:25:32.858 --> 00:25:40.163]  People called into his show and were talking about the explosions that they heard before the towers went down.
[00:25:40.163 --> 00:25:47.408]  And what Glenn Beck said, what an idiot, he said that it was people jumping from the buildings sounding like explosions.
[00:25:47.748 --> 00:25:58.015]  Well, yeah, people did jump from the buildings, but there's a difference between, you know, a body smacking the pavement, which I'm sure from however many stories up, it's going to sound pretty loud.
[00:25:58.015 --> 00:26:01.998]  It's not going to be the sound of an explosion, you know, like a grenade.
[00:26:01.998 --> 00:26:04.780]  I've heard grenades, and it wouldn't be a body smacking the pavement.
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:09.764]  Well, the police are saying, get back, they're bringing it down, they're bringing it down, and the owner said they blew it up.
[00:26:09.764 --> 00:26:15.608]  And then there's all the witnesses and the countdown and the rest of it, but the key here is Glenn Beck.
[00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:20.512]  We'll come on the air and say they're setting up a one-world government, the bankers are taking over.
[00:26:20.512 --> 00:26:26.394]  But he does that only after they finally announce it on the news, then he will talk about it.
[00:26:26.394 --> 00:26:40.341]  He'll talk about the Treaty of the Sea, you know, Law of the Sea Treaty, or the Department of Peace, you know, that Obama wants to set up that's really a department of disarming the people and actually waging war wars against innocent individuals.
[00:26:40.341 --> 00:26:42.502]  The Department of Peace is about disarming
[00:26:43.228 --> 00:26:48.293]  You might have half-truths, but the people are seeing through the lies more and more.
[00:26:48.293 --> 00:26:58.663]  I was about to say that what Glen Beck does is that he will tell a lot of things that are true, but then mix in lies and say, we need to go ahead and arrest 9-11 truthers.
[00:26:58.663 --> 00:27:00.164]  We need to go ahead and use the military.
[00:27:00.164 --> 00:27:07.872]  Remember, he said, use the military on 9-11 truthers, and then five, six months later came out and said, oh my gosh, they want to use the military against the American people.
[00:27:08.352 --> 00:27:12.676]  I can tell ya, I am a member of the military, and I'm not going along with it.
[00:27:12.676 --> 00:27:13.796]  I'm not.
[00:27:13.796 --> 00:27:14.997]  I refuse.
[00:27:14.997 --> 00:27:19.801]  I stick by and not obey any unlawful orders, and we see through the garbage.
[00:27:19.801 --> 00:27:25.986]  And unfortunately, a segue into Obama and global warming and the rest, I had a buddy of mine,
[00:27:26.745 --> 00:27:32.168]  Uh, you know, who's right in there with me, in the guard, on 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:27:32.168 --> 00:27:37.952]  He's had another buddy on the air that's a member of a college radio station and says stuff when he can about it.
[00:27:37.952 --> 00:27:42.474]  But as soon as Obama got elected, he's like, oh man, things are gonna change, things are gonna change.
[00:27:42.474 --> 00:27:47.217]  So, I still gotta, I gotta work on him and getting him to see through the picture completely.
[00:27:48.237 --> 00:28:02.785]  I'm sorry, I don't want to take up all your time, your listeners' time, but I just attended a concert recently at UMaine, an OAR concert, and the thing about it is it was part of a campus, a global consciousness core,
[00:28:04.395 --> 00:28:05.416]  I don't think so.
[00:28:22.469 --> 00:28:22.889]  Indulgence.
[00:28:22.889 --> 00:28:26.552]  It's like an indulgence, you know, 500 years ago you'd buy from the Catholic Church.
[00:28:26.552 --> 00:28:30.734]  If it cheated on your wife, you'd go, you know, buy some indulgences.
[00:28:30.734 --> 00:28:32.855]  It's a total fraud.
[00:28:32.855 --> 00:28:34.116]  And again, it's a tax.
[00:28:34.116 --> 00:28:40.000]  But they train you for taxes first with you voluntarily going out and paying the tax.
[00:28:41.181 --> 00:28:42.342]  Yeah, that's just what we need, folks.
[00:28:42.342 --> 00:28:43.283]  More taxes.
[00:28:43.283 --> 00:28:44.543]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[00:28:44.543 --> 00:28:46.245]  Good to have you on board, Zach.
[00:28:46.245 --> 00:28:48.746]  Igor, Tony, Ted, Chris, everybody else.
[00:28:48.746 --> 00:28:49.987]  Your call's straight ahead.
[00:28:49.987 --> 00:28:58.533]  Wide open phones, a ton of news, and a whole bunch of big guests today.
[00:28:58.533 --> 00:28:59.934]  We're on the march.
[00:28:59.934 --> 00:29:02.456]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:02.456 --> 00:29:05.158]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:08.331 --> 00:29:14.594]  If I had something to spray on my license plate that would block off the camera, you bet your papa bring it on!
[00:29:14.594 --> 00:29:17.095]  KETV News Watch 7.
[00:29:17.095 --> 00:29:21.297]  It will render a license plate unreadable to the red light cameras.
[00:29:21.297 --> 00:29:22.598]  We are under the microscope.
[00:29:22.598 --> 00:29:26.420]  Red light cameras and speed cameras are in place to make money, not for your safety.
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.981]  But you don't have to be defenseless against these unconstitutional devices.

[00:30:08.166 --> 00:30:10.127]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[00:30:10.127 --> 00:30:13.730]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:15.531]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:30:16.171 --> 00:30:19.213]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:30:19.213 --> 00:30:24.957]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:30:24.957 --> 00:30:29.200]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:34.404]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.TV is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[00:30:34.404 --> 00:30:37.446]  PrisonPlanet.TV is a vault of forbidden information.

[00:31:06.283 --> 00:31:07.024]  PrisonPlanet.TV
[00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:10.731]  We're good to go.
[00:31:26.362 --> 00:31:30.005]  Now, Survival of Seeds introduces their Escape the Beast Kit.
[00:31:30.005 --> 00:31:33.368]  24 varieties of all-natural, non-genetically modified heirloom seeds.
[00:31:33.368 --> 00:31:36.250]  For true patriots and homesteaders wanting food insurance.
[00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:40.874]  That's over 5 pounds of rare historic seeds for a penny per seed.
[00:31:40.874 --> 00:31:44.056]  15,000 seeds that will feed a family healthy food for 7 years.
[00:31:44.056 --> 00:31:53.203]  Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me, is including an instructional DVD that will teach you how to earn big money selling the produce from his incredible heirloom seeds back to him.
[00:31:53.203 --> 00:31:54.684]  Restaurants and small delis.
[00:31:54.684 --> 00:31:55.725]  Don't buy from copycats.
[00:31:55.745 --> 00:31:56.246]  I think so.
[00:32:37.424 --> 00:33:02.771]  A big part of the problem we face is that if you study corruption in any society at any time, once governments, once companies, once institutions get a culture of corruption, once corruption sets in, even the smallest corruption
[00:33:05.686 --> 00:33:07.748]  Then you accept a little more.
[00:33:07.748 --> 00:33:08.429]  A little bit more.
[00:33:08.429 --> 00:33:09.089]  A little bit more.
[00:33:09.089 --> 00:33:13.072]  Until you've got all sorts of criminals.
[00:33:13.072 --> 00:33:20.158]  You've got people in government that are doing bid rigging and contract scams and all sorts of fraud and double billing.
[00:33:20.158 --> 00:33:21.399]  You know, just classic things.
[00:33:21.399 --> 00:33:24.401]  But then it becomes, you know, stealing people's houses.
[00:33:24.401 --> 00:33:28.044]  Being an IRS auditor who makes up stuff.
[00:33:28.044 --> 00:33:29.926]  Or being a federal prosecutor.
[00:33:30.914 --> 00:33:55.729]  I mean, federal courts openly operate where they'll bring in informants that you've never seen, never talked to, who testify in hundreds of trials a year, the judge, everybody knows it's a lie, the jury, are like little children from the general public, they don't know, and they'll bring up 5, 6, 10, 15, 20, you know, fake people, never met you, and they'll just say, I swear I saw him dealing cocaine, I swear I saw him laundering money.
[00:33:55.729 --> 00:33:56.790]  That's like crime labs.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.683]  Every major crime lab in the country that I've ever looked at.
[00:34:01.683 --> 00:34:07.250]  I mean, I see three or four articles a week about Boston and Houston and Dallas and L.A.
[00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:15.299]  and El Paso and... Just... I mean, any town you can imagine, any city of over 100,000 people...
[00:34:17.552 --> 00:34:38.630]  Because they so sloppily do it, and they'll put thousands of people per town behind bars over the years, which is totally made-up crime labs, made-up witnesses, that they run into people that end up being able to get witnesses and document it, and then, because there are still some good cops, they'll blow the whistle, and then you'll hear, okay, they framed, in one year, 4,000 plus people in Houston,
[00:34:40.592 --> 00:34:47.838]  And they just falsified all the evidence, but that's just what they do, and nobody's getting in trouble, or... Oh, the FBI Crime Lab!
[00:34:47.838 --> 00:34:58.686]  You know, we've had a bunch of, uh, people that work there, including the head of the Forensics Department, come out, Frederick Whitehurst, and say that it was industrialized fraud, just open fraud, not even hidden!
[00:34:58.686 --> 00:35:05.091]  They didn't even sneak around about it, it was just, okay, let's go frame everybody today!
[00:35:05.091 --> 00:35:06.573]  I mean, that's your government!
[00:35:06.573 --> 00:35:09.635]  Totally bankrupt, totally criminal!
[00:35:10.828 --> 00:35:12.309]  At the top.
[00:35:12.309 --> 00:35:20.413]  And they're busy kicking all the good people out, and then not even just kicking out good people, they're brainwashing people.
[00:35:20.413 --> 00:35:34.060]  There's a lot of people who aren't inherently evil, they're just really shallow, they're not very smart, or if they are smart, they're so mesmerized in TV and culture that they're not paying attention.
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:36.722]  And so they're told, hey, we frame people, hey, we
[00:35:37.483 --> 00:35:38.424]  We torture people.
[00:35:38.424 --> 00:35:40.845]  Hey, we, uh, you know, do this and that.
[00:35:40.845 --> 00:35:45.008]  And it's just like, okay, well, you know, I've been given a training manual.
[00:35:45.008 --> 00:35:46.069]  I'm an army captain.
[00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:47.290]  It says I torture people.
[00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:50.192]  It says I stage fake terror attacks.
[00:35:50.192 --> 00:35:52.474]  That's how we win wars.
[00:35:52.474 --> 00:35:54.715]  This is just what we do.
[00:35:54.715 --> 00:35:56.617]  It's just collateral damage in a war.
[00:35:56.617 --> 00:36:05.043]  You know, we kill 3,000 so we can save millions from Al-Qaeda attack.
[00:36:05.043 --> 00:36:06.524]  And that's the bankrupt mindset.
[00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:14.493]  That's the bankrupt system.
[00:36:14.493 --> 00:36:16.614]  Let's go to Igor in Virginia.
[00:36:16.614 --> 00:36:20.837]  Igor, you're on the air.
[00:36:20.837 --> 00:36:21.417]  Hello?
[00:36:21.417 --> 00:36:21.557]  Yes.
[00:36:22.301 --> 00:36:22.821]  How you doing Alex?
[00:36:22.821 --> 00:36:24.942]  I'm a big fan of your show for two years now.
[00:36:24.942 --> 00:36:26.262]  I'm 22 years old.
[00:36:26.262 --> 00:36:28.103]  I came from Ukraine 11 years ago.
[00:36:28.103 --> 00:36:28.843]  Love this country.
[00:36:28.843 --> 00:36:32.804]  I like what Ron Paul was saying.
[00:36:32.804 --> 00:36:34.605]  We need to stand up to the New World Order.
[00:36:34.605 --> 00:36:38.406]  I voted for Chuck Baldwin and got my citizenship not too long ago.
[00:36:38.406 --> 00:36:41.487]  I thought you were nuts at first when I started listening to you.
[00:36:41.487 --> 00:36:47.929]  But since I started listening to you, I started researching and started reading all these books about the Bilderbergers and the New World Order.
[00:36:47.929 --> 00:36:49.709]  And I understood what was going on.
[00:36:49.709 --> 00:36:51.070]  Please don't stop talking about this man.
[00:36:52.139 --> 00:36:55.002]  Like, I really feel like you're a legend, man.
[00:36:55.002 --> 00:37:01.767]  I tell everybody about you, and the most important thing is for me to ask questions, demand the answers to our problems.
[00:37:01.767 --> 00:37:05.951]  Obama's not, you know, he's not talking about any sort of change.
[00:37:05.951 --> 00:37:08.013]  It's just words, it's rhetoric.
[00:37:08.013 --> 00:37:13.257]  He's, you know, he's lining himself with the same people that have been there for generations now.
[00:37:13.257 --> 00:37:15.399]  Well, let me say this.
[00:37:15.399 --> 00:37:17.081]  I'll tell you who legend is.
[00:37:18.474 --> 00:37:24.276]  People don't need to build me up as some superhuman, as some special person.
[00:37:24.276 --> 00:37:28.598]  I'm just somebody who's aggressive and I'm not going to be a slave.
[00:37:28.598 --> 00:37:42.064]  And so I've taken publicly available information and aggressively told the people that they have power historically and that they are an unstoppable force when they simply set their mind in motion into action.
[00:37:42.064 --> 00:37:45.885]  So I'll tell you, I'll tell you the legend is Igor, it's you.
[00:37:45.885 --> 00:37:46.665]  The legend is
[00:37:48.166 --> 00:37:50.327]  People like Zach before you.
[00:37:50.327 --> 00:37:56.692]  The legend is the single mom busting her butt to raise children to not end up in the prison system.
[00:37:56.692 --> 00:38:03.296]  The legend is the firefighter that goes into a burning house to save children and the floor caves in and he dies or she dies.
[00:38:03.296 --> 00:38:08.619]  The legend is the people that broke their backs throughout history to stand up against tyranny.
[00:38:08.619 --> 00:38:11.161]  People like Alexander Schultz and Edson.
[00:38:11.161 --> 00:38:13.983]  And that's who we need to respect and appreciate.
[00:38:13.983 --> 00:38:17.345]  And look, on the surface, I do have courage.
[00:38:18.871 --> 00:38:20.952]  But that's a mind trick.
[00:38:20.952 --> 00:38:21.592]  Okay?
[00:38:21.592 --> 00:38:27.314]  I am able to intellectually understand that there's greater danger not fighting this to my progeny.
[00:38:27.314 --> 00:38:29.095]  And my progeny come first.
[00:38:29.095 --> 00:38:30.575]  And we're all connected.
[00:38:30.575 --> 00:38:32.296]  We're all genetically related.
[00:38:32.296 --> 00:38:34.076]  Everybody is my family.
[00:38:34.076 --> 00:38:40.599]  And so, that is why, as a male, it isn't something special.
[00:38:40.599 --> 00:38:44.880]  Males are meant, when their cave is attacked, when there's a threat,
[00:38:45.572 --> 00:38:55.317]  To stand up and fight it, and so I'm doing what I was made to do, and the power is people like you spreading the word about the radio show, about the websites, and God bless you.
[00:38:55.317 --> 00:38:56.957]  Igor, go ahead and finish up.
[00:38:56.957 --> 00:38:57.478]  Absolutely, sir.
[00:38:57.478 --> 00:38:59.218]  You're absolutely right.
[00:38:59.218 --> 00:39:00.239]  We're all legends.
[00:39:00.239 --> 00:39:08.843]  What I meant by, when I said legend, I meant, like, that you broke, like, you know, you woke me up to what was going on, because I've been listening to all these idiots, you know.
[00:39:08.843 --> 00:39:13.685]  I'm sorry, not idiots, but, like, you know, all these people on the air, and, you know,
[00:39:14.525 --> 00:39:16.285]  Just spreading garbage.
[00:39:16.285 --> 00:39:17.566]  You know, and all these people are brainwashed.
[00:39:17.566 --> 00:39:18.886]  We're like zombies now.
[00:39:18.886 --> 00:39:24.008]  Anyway, my question is, sir, what do you see happening in the next two years with this Obama administration?
[00:39:24.008 --> 00:39:29.489]  Because, you know, the first 100 days is critical, and the first two years is when the Democrats have full power.
[00:39:29.489 --> 00:39:32.530]  And how long do you think it will take people to realize that Obama's a fraud?
[00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:37.091]  And when do you see the war in Iran starting and other wars expanding?
[00:39:37.091 --> 00:39:38.331]  Thank you, sir.
[00:39:38.331 --> 00:39:38.972]  Thank you, Igor.
[00:39:38.972 --> 00:39:39.972]  Good to hear from you.
[00:39:39.972 --> 00:39:41.812]  What will Obama do?
[00:39:41.812 --> 00:39:43.173]  That's question number one.
[00:39:43.173 --> 00:39:43.733]  Number two,
[00:39:44.873 --> 00:39:46.334]  When will people see through him?
[00:39:46.334 --> 00:39:50.075]  When will they see through him?
[00:39:50.075 --> 00:39:56.458]  And the other one is, will they attack Iran or when?
[00:39:56.458 --> 00:39:57.719]  When Iran.
[00:39:57.719 --> 00:40:01.841]  And what I'll do is, next hour, I will answer those questions.
[00:40:01.841 --> 00:40:08.503]  Because I keep meaning to really get into what Obama's saying he's going to do publicly versus who he's hiring, what his policies are.
[00:40:08.503 --> 00:40:10.064]  I'll go over that.
[00:40:10.064 --> 00:40:11.845]  And then when I think people will wake up to him.
[00:40:13.331 --> 00:40:21.655]  That'll be when the media finally stops saying he's the Christ, the second coming, and then when they give you a new puppet to believe in.
[00:40:21.655 --> 00:40:27.379]  But we'll get more into that coming up later after I talk to Tony, Ted, Chris, Tulia, and others.
[00:40:27.379 --> 00:40:31.441]  But for the next ten minutes or so, he joins us once a month.
[00:40:31.441 --> 00:40:32.921]  He's a sponsor of the show.
[00:40:32.921 --> 00:40:34.983]  I've been here, I don't know, like three years with us now.
[00:40:34.983 --> 00:40:37.784]  He's been with Genesis for about five, six.
[00:40:37.784 --> 00:40:39.465]  And he never sold to the public.
[00:40:41.207 --> 00:40:46.131]  Until Michael Trudeau, the sales manager at Genesis, who is indoor true organics.
[00:40:46.131 --> 00:40:47.813]  He's a conservative, but he's in organics.
[00:40:47.813 --> 00:40:50.115]  Why have your kids bathe in poison?
[00:40:50.115 --> 00:40:53.858]  Found out about what hospitals and finer hotels were buying and saving money.
[00:40:53.858 --> 00:40:57.481]  It's funny, you get better quality and save money if you know what to do.
[00:40:57.481 --> 00:41:02.005]  The public buys the toxic chemicals, the byproducts of the World War II.
[00:41:02.005 --> 00:41:04.307]  They figured out how to take the toxic waste and put it into your
[00:41:05.362 --> 00:41:08.663]  Put it into your, uh, what they call shampoos and soaps and cleaners.
[00:41:08.663 --> 00:41:13.843]  The toxic detergents, the byproducts of petrochemical.
[00:41:13.843 --> 00:41:16.664]  And, uh, well, Marty's just got old-fashioned soap!
[00:41:16.664 --> 00:41:26.646]  And then he and his dad, back in 47, when he got back from World War II, Marty and the Chemical Corps... So he knew what chemical weapons were, that's why he freaked out when he read a box of soap.
[00:41:26.646 --> 00:41:27.826]  Found out it wasn't.
[00:41:27.826 --> 00:41:30.626]  They went back and made the old-fashioned stuff.
[00:41:30.626 --> 00:41:32.827]  With citrus and vegetables.
[00:41:32.827 --> 00:41:33.887]  And, you know, cherry oil.
[00:41:34.614 --> 00:41:38.096]  Uh, Essence and, and, and, and Oranges and all of that.
[00:41:38.096 --> 00:41:42.940]  And, uh, you save 85% off supermarket prices.
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:47.302]  And I know a lot of people, uh, now use Calvin Pierce Soap.
[00:41:47.302 --> 00:41:54.907]  I'll be at friends' houses and see it on the, you know, above the sink, or I'll be at my aunt and uncle's and see it, you know, in their shower.
[00:41:54.907 --> 00:42:01.832]  And so I know a lot of people out there are now using it, and that's, uh, very exciting and we're glad that folks are doing that.
[00:42:01.832 --> 00:42:03.033]  Marty, good to have you here with us.
[00:42:03.957 --> 00:42:07.318]  Alex, a pleasure again to talk to you and your listeners.
[00:42:07.318 --> 00:42:10.359]  Try to bring them up to date.
[00:42:10.359 --> 00:42:13.500]  Marty, I'm hearing a disconnect line.
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:16.061]  I think you may have a line on your phone system that's disconnected.
[00:42:16.061 --> 00:42:18.102]  I'm not sure if that's going out over air, though.
[00:42:18.102 --> 00:42:19.963]  No, everything seems to be clear.
[00:42:19.963 --> 00:42:22.844]  Your voice is coming through beautifully.
[00:42:22.844 --> 00:42:23.664]  Okay, fantastic.
[00:42:23.664 --> 00:42:25.104]  It's gone now.
[00:42:25.104 --> 00:42:30.986]  Marty, let's... Again, I know we basically tell the same story, but slightly, you know, different areas of it each time.
[00:42:30.986 --> 00:42:31.827]  It's such a big story.
[00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:43.676]  I think the most important thing here today is, well you can talk about whatever you want in the time we have, but what is in real soap that you make versus what we're using at the stores?
[00:42:44.767 --> 00:42:48.450]  We try to make soap from all natural substances.
[00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:57.576]  We use coconut oils, we use vegetable oils, we use fruit juices like orange juice, cherry juice, and honey.
[00:42:57.576 --> 00:43:04.521]  All these additives to repel the perfumes that are toxic in all the products.
[00:43:05.074 --> 00:43:08.937]  You don't need a respirator when you use our products.
[00:43:08.937 --> 00:43:17.782]  You do need one when you go to the supermarket, and one-third of that market has cleaning chemicals in it, and it makes it difficult to breathe.
[00:43:17.782 --> 00:43:23.806]  Perfumes are not good for human consumption, human use, or human smell.
[00:43:23.806 --> 00:43:29.750]  They're just there to doctor up the detergents that are made from waste petroleum.
[00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:32.011]  They're real dark chemicals.
[00:43:32.011 --> 00:43:34.433]  They bleach them out to make them white.
[00:43:34.993 --> 00:43:52.209]  They pour sodium chloride in it, which is table salt, to make it free-flowing, and to kill the bad petroleum odors, they use perfumes saturating the products so you can't recognize the foul petroleums that are in the products.
[00:43:52.749 --> 00:44:06.617]  And what we do is the old-fashioned methods of making the products, dissolving the oils, putting in the coconut oils and the vegetable oils, compressing them, and making products that don't exist in the United States today.
[00:44:06.617 --> 00:44:08.819]  I'm not sure about Europe.
[00:44:08.819 --> 00:44:14.762]  I know we're shipping goods right now to Hong Kong, China, because they have nothing like that.
[00:44:14.762 --> 00:44:19.265]  And we ship tons of our pure soaps to Hong Kong every month.
[00:44:19.989 --> 00:44:25.599]  To two big health food stores that distribute our products there, and they love it.
[00:44:25.599 --> 00:44:31.310]  We've been doing that for three years, and we've been with you for over three years, and we love it.
[00:44:34.019 --> 00:44:37.200]  Marty, tell folks about your line of real soaps.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:57.606]  Okay, what we're talking about, if you wanted to get into bulk packaging of real soap, you can get direct from factory, which is us, a one to two year supply, which is weighed out about 65 pounds, is equal to a thousand pounds of chemicals of the supermarket for three dollars a week.
[00:44:58.266 --> 00:45:03.849]  You can get a 3 to 4 year supply, 145 pounds, which is equal to 2,000 pounds, a ton, $2.50 per week.
[00:45:03.849 --> 00:45:09.771]  A 4 to 5 year supply, we're talking 210 pounds for shipping, that's equal to supermarket chemicals, 3,000 pounds, over a ton and a half.
[00:45:09.771 --> 00:45:10.872]  That's $2 per week.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:28.434]  What does it cost you now to buy these chemicals in the marketplace?
[00:45:28.434 --> 00:45:31.562]  And I got what you call a public service announcement.
[00:45:32.634 --> 00:45:43.277]  If you're using and buying from the market toothpaste, mouthwash, Lysol, antibacterials, all-purpose cleaners, oven cleaners, shampoos, etc.
[00:45:43.277 --> 00:45:45.638]  Let me give you the Poison Control Center number.
[00:45:45.638 --> 00:45:45.778]  800-222-1222.
[00:45:45.778 --> 00:45:47.159]  I'll repeat that again.
[00:45:47.159 --> 00:45:50.359]  Call the Poison Control Center using all these chemicals.
[00:45:50.359 --> 00:45:50.420]  800-222-1222.
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:51.360]  That'll help you
[00:46:02.003 --> 00:46:03.464]  Keep it on your refrigerator.
[00:46:03.464 --> 00:46:04.765]  Keep it in your kitchen.
[00:46:04.765 --> 00:46:06.127]  Keep it in your bathroom.
[00:46:06.127 --> 00:46:08.208]  You never know when you're going to need it.
[00:46:08.208 --> 00:46:13.132]  Those stuff, the chemicals that are made from Procter & Gamble.
[00:46:13.132 --> 00:46:20.018]  And I just found out that Procter & Gamble is outsourcing their manufacturing to China.
[00:46:20.018 --> 00:46:20.939]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:46:20.939 --> 00:46:24.882]  Procter & Gamble was bought by a European company.
[00:46:24.882 --> 00:46:27.024]  What, by Gillette?
[00:46:27.024 --> 00:46:30.827]  And then if you expand out from there, most of our pharmaceuticals
[00:46:31.607 --> 00:46:38.380]  I know it's more than 80% are now made in China because they can put anything they want in there.
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:43.170]  And so it is just a complete and total crisis that we're facing.
[00:46:44.313 --> 00:46:48.397]  But again, Marty, tell folks how they call and how they get.
[00:46:48.397 --> 00:46:50.218]  You also have a tote bag, a sampler.
[00:46:50.218 --> 00:47:02.089]  Well, not only do we have the bulk packages to save you literally a small fortune of what it's costing you now, you can also buy the individual products as you need them, as you like them.
[00:47:02.089 --> 00:47:07.814]  When you go to go to the supermarket and there's nothing priced anymore, there's no prices on anything.
[00:47:07.814 --> 00:47:09.095]  There's barcodes.
[00:47:09.495 --> 00:47:13.296]  And you gotta go to the checkout counter to figure out what you just bought.
[00:47:13.296 --> 00:47:19.757]  We give you a price schedule on everything, breaking down per item, per bulk, per savings.
[00:47:19.757 --> 00:47:20.737]  We do that.
[00:47:20.737 --> 00:47:22.858]  We have been doing that since 1947.
[00:47:22.858 --> 00:47:28.439]  61 years of our company going down the drain.
[00:47:28.439 --> 00:47:32.880]  And our guarantee is our satisfaction guarantee, or double your dirt back.
[00:47:35.013 --> 00:47:37.634]  Marty, you're something else.
[00:47:37.634 --> 00:47:39.135]  Anyway, we make the products.
[00:47:39.135 --> 00:47:40.355]  We've got the products.
[00:47:40.355 --> 00:47:41.976]  You can reach us 1-800-340-7091.
[00:47:41.976 --> 00:47:42.236]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[00:47:42.236 --> 00:47:43.837]  You'll talk to me.
[00:47:43.837 --> 00:47:45.818]  You'll talk to my son.
[00:47:45.818 --> 00:47:47.419]  You'll talk to my daughter.
[00:47:47.419 --> 00:47:48.819]  We're a family company.
[00:47:48.819 --> 00:47:50.440]  We are not a corporation.
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:51.821]  We take care of you personally.
[00:47:59.904 --> 00:48:07.227]  We feel that you are very valuable to keep clean, to keep healthy, to keep economically stable.
[00:48:07.227 --> 00:48:08.348]  We do that.
[00:48:08.348 --> 00:48:09.648]  Let me give folks the website.
[00:48:09.648 --> 00:48:16.771]  It's 5, just the number, 5starsoap.com, or you can spell out 5starsoap.com.
[00:48:16.771 --> 00:48:17.672]  5starsoap.com.
[00:48:17.672 --> 00:48:23.374]  We have banners up on infowars.com and jonesreport.com.
[00:48:23.374 --> 00:48:27.016]  If you forget the address, 5starsoap.com, but give out that number, Marnie.
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:29.160]  800-340-7091.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:40.783]  And not only can you get the bulk packages, and not only can you get individual packages, you think, well, this is too good to be true!
[00:48:40.783 --> 00:48:42.223]  I don't know if I'm going to like this!
[00:48:42.223 --> 00:48:44.464]  I've never heard of that company before!
[00:48:44.464 --> 00:48:47.105]  You know, they're the world's best kept secret!
[00:48:47.105 --> 00:48:48.145]  Nobody knows about us!
[00:48:48.145 --> 00:48:55.827]  That's why we're talking to you through Alex, so that we can give you information that's honest, and true, and safe.
[00:48:56.267 --> 00:49:01.252]  And this is what we do, and you can reach us through our website, which has all the information.
[00:49:01.252 --> 00:49:02.513]  Our toll-free number.
[00:49:02.513 --> 00:49:04.295]  You'll talk to us directly.
[00:49:04.295 --> 00:49:08.900]  We ship it direct from our factory in Oakland, California, direct to your door.
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:10.361]  We don't care where you are.
[00:49:10.361 --> 00:49:12.824]  We use United Parcel all over the world.
[00:49:12.824 --> 00:49:13.825]  FiveStarsSoap.com.
[00:49:13.825 --> 00:49:15.406]  Give them the number one more time, Marty.
[00:49:15.406 --> 00:49:15.446]  800-340-800.
[00:49:20.111 --> 00:49:20.431]  7091.
[00:49:20.431 --> 00:49:32.823]  You can get a miniaturized sampler of our package for $20 plus shipping, which will give you a very good taste for a four to eight week supply, so you don't take care of your reluctance.
[00:49:32.823 --> 00:49:34.645]  Try it before you buy it.
[00:49:34.645 --> 00:49:37.267]  Absolutely don't procrastinate folks, because this really is a good deal.
[00:49:37.267 --> 00:49:38.008]  I really do believe in it.
[00:49:38.428 --> 00:49:41.289]  All the sponsors I endorse, I really do believe in and think are great.
[00:49:41.289 --> 00:49:48.612]  This is one of the best offers that we bring you, the listeners here, and it makes everything we do here possible.
[00:49:48.612 --> 00:49:53.114]  Marty from 5starsub.com, a Cal Bend Pure subcompany out in Oakland, California.
[00:49:53.114 --> 00:49:54.195]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:49:54.195 --> 00:49:54.695]  Thank you.
[00:49:54.695 --> 00:49:56.155]  Get ready for your limerick for the day.
[00:49:56.155 --> 00:49:57.336]  Give it to us fast.
[00:49:57.336 --> 00:49:59.537]  There was a young fellow named Sidney,
[00:50:07.654 --> 00:50:09.716]  I am so frustrated.
[00:50:09.716 --> 00:50:12.058]  I can't seem to remember anything anymore.
[00:50:12.058 --> 00:50:12.639]  What?
[00:50:12.639 --> 00:50:15.381]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible.
[00:50:15.381 --> 00:50:16.803]  I read something and forget.
[00:50:16.803 --> 00:50:18.064]  I forget people's names.
[00:50:18.064 --> 00:50:21.507]  I hear all this great information on the radio and I want to tell people but I forget.
[00:50:22.047 --> 00:50:23.588]  Okay, slow down.
[00:50:23.588 --> 00:50:26.170]  Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault.
[00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:33.314]  Factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum in deodorants, genetically modified foods, the way the education system taught you.
[00:50:33.314 --> 00:50:34.934]  It's all meant to dumb you down.
[00:50:34.934 --> 00:50:36.675]  You know, I can remember everything now.
[00:50:36.675 --> 00:50:37.596]  Even entire books!
[00:50:37.836 --> 00:50:38.116]  What?
[00:50:38.116 --> 00:50:38.677]  How?
[00:50:38.677 --> 00:50:41.940]  There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory.
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:45.724]  Their online course is a real breakthrough in the field of memory improvement.
[00:50:45.724 --> 00:50:55.353]  In fact, they guarantee that every single person will be able to memorize any type of information, including entire books, after they complete just 60 lessons.
[00:50:55.353 --> 00:51:00.738]  And they offer a no-questions-asked, no-time-limit, money-back guarantee.
[00:51:00.738 --> 00:51:01.258]  Wow.
[00:51:01.258 --> 00:51:01.939]  What's the website?
[00:51:02.279 --> 00:51:05.741]  Now don't forget, it's Pmemory.net.
[00:51:05.741 --> 00:51:08.483]  The letter P, memory dot net.
[00:51:08.483 --> 00:51:15.227]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:51:15.227 --> 00:51:16.908]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:51:17.848 --> 00:51:19.409]  But who is the enemy?
[00:51:19.409 --> 00:51:20.210]  Bin Laden.
[00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:21.271]  This is his MO.
[00:51:21.271 --> 00:51:22.572]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:51:22.572 --> 00:51:24.573]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:51:24.573 --> 00:51:31.718]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:51:31.718 --> 00:51:32.199]  Some U.S.
[00:51:32.199 --> 00:51:37.863]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:51:38.543 --> 00:51:42.026]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:51:42.026 --> 00:51:45.128]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:52:08.374 --> 00:52:10.815]  Imagine feeling totally helpless.
[00:52:10.815 --> 00:52:17.097]  Imagine thinking and hearing clearly, but unable to move as the ground rises to meet you.
[00:52:17.097 --> 00:52:26.680]  Imagine the pain of a thousand needles as your body is invaded, locked, and hammered by 50,000 volts of the latest in taser technology.
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:34.203]  If this sounds scary, imagine how it would feel for anyone attempting to victimize a friend, loved one, or even yourself.

[00:52:58.371 --> 00:52:58.752]  We're good.
[00:53:24.287 --> 00:53:25.828]  Marty is something else, folks.
[00:53:25.828 --> 00:53:30.450]  I wanted to hold him over to finish his limerick.
[00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:33.191]  It's bad luck not to finish it and he hung up.
[00:53:33.191 --> 00:53:34.592]  And I got callers calling in.
[00:53:34.592 --> 00:53:37.954]  Doug in Tennessee, a Calvin testimonial.
[00:53:37.954 --> 00:53:42.856]  He'll turn into a huge testimonial of how much they love it.
[00:53:42.856 --> 00:53:44.417]  I got all this news I need to cover.
[00:53:44.417 --> 00:53:46.818]  And some of it's really good news.
[00:53:46.818 --> 00:53:50.220]  Like, they are successfully growing organs and now I'm planting them in people.
[00:53:53.141 --> 00:53:55.882]  And people are doing it with their own tissue.
[00:53:55.882 --> 00:53:59.144]  They're not having to kill a baby to do it.
[00:53:59.144 --> 00:54:04.447]  You know, going back a few years ago, there was this big debate about, well, should we use, you know, the tissue of aborted babies?
[00:54:04.447 --> 00:54:05.927]  And then they call that stem cell.
[00:54:05.927 --> 00:54:13.491]  But there's some other tissues that are also stem cell, like placenta and other things associated with the birth.
[00:54:13.491 --> 00:54:17.053]  But they were trying to cloud the issue in the media to set the precedent.
[00:54:17.648 --> 00:54:23.831]  To have these half-human, half-animal chimeras so they could do different genetic experiments and set that precedent.
[00:54:23.831 --> 00:54:37.237]  But, of course, then it came out that there are a lot of other tissues that are stem cells in our own bodies that work just as good or better and we don't have to kill a baby to do it.
[00:54:37.237 --> 00:54:46.381]  So, very interesting news on that front and I also want to go to Tony and Ted and Chris and Tulia
[00:54:47.706 --> 00:54:53.170]  Oh my gosh, okay.
[00:54:53.170 --> 00:55:01.556]  Let's start again, this is a very old one.
[00:55:01.556 --> 00:55:08.140]  There was a young fellow named Sidney who drank till he ruined his kidney.
[00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:11.603]  It shriveled and shrank as he sat there and drank.
[00:55:12.423 --> 00:55:16.205]  But he had a good time doing it, didn't he?
[00:55:16.205 --> 00:55:19.487]  Hey Marty, Doug, and then we'll have a hundred more of these later.
[00:55:19.487 --> 00:55:21.969]  Please, folks, don't call with the testimonials.
[00:55:21.969 --> 00:55:24.710]  We appreciate it, but once we start with one, we'll definitely get more.
[00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:32.035]  It'll be like David and Joyce's show, but Doug in Tennessee says he has a Cal Bend testimonial.
[00:55:32.035 --> 00:55:34.036]  Go ahead, Doug, tell us about it.
[00:55:34.036 --> 00:55:39.980]  Hey, Alex, I used to shave with edge gel, and one day I read the
[00:55:41.621 --> 00:55:44.482]  You want to know a story?
[00:55:44.482 --> 00:55:46.523]  I do the same thing with Calvin Bar Soap.
[00:56:08.192 --> 00:56:11.554]  Again, they figured out how to sell you a million products.
[00:56:11.554 --> 00:56:13.315]  You don't need shaving cream.
[00:56:13.315 --> 00:56:16.097]  You don't need all these little side items.
[00:56:16.097 --> 00:56:18.358]  Real soaps you can use for a whole host.
[00:56:19.833 --> 00:56:27.157]  I don't have the rashes.
[00:56:27.157 --> 00:56:29.138]  I don't get the dry skin in the winter.
[00:56:29.138 --> 00:56:31.220]  The stuff is deadly poison.
[00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:34.421]  So, if you're not going to use Calbin, use some other organic stuff.
[00:56:34.421 --> 00:56:37.763]  It's just for some reason, it always costs more than the chemical stuff.
[00:56:37.763 --> 00:56:41.205]  And Calbin, because it's factory direct, costs less than the factory stuff.
[00:56:41.625 --> 00:56:43.386]  But thank you for that testimonial.
[00:56:43.386 --> 00:56:44.948]  Marty, I bet you get a lot of those.
[00:56:44.948 --> 00:56:46.128]  Yes, endlessly.
[00:56:46.128 --> 00:56:50.612]  People phoning, people sending emails, people sending faxes.
[00:56:50.612 --> 00:56:56.316]  It swamps us down, the appreciation that we get and the compliments we get.
[00:56:56.316 --> 00:57:07.705]  And I'm talking about a heavy, heavy communication, which we appreciate very much, more than we've ever gotten since we've been in business all these years.
[00:57:07.705 --> 00:57:11.027]  We finally hit the nerve of the consumer that we got.
[00:57:11.067 --> 00:57:12.068]  What's something for them?
[00:57:12.068 --> 00:57:14.530]  Well, you finally hit an audience that isn't completely brain-dead.
[00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:15.010]  Exactly.
[00:57:15.010 --> 00:57:22.696]  I mean, you tell the general public that's drinking fluoride and taking Prozac and drinking Jack Daniels every night and watching, you know, football every day.
[00:57:22.696 --> 00:57:27.639]  I mean, you try to tell them, hey, you don't want to pay a whole bunch more money for toxic waste.
[00:57:27.639 --> 00:57:30.922]  They just, you know, basically say you're from Planet X and laugh at you.
[00:57:30.922 --> 00:57:32.343]  Marty, good to hear from you.
[00:57:32.343 --> 00:57:33.203]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:57:33.203 --> 00:57:34.604]  I appreciate this very much.
[00:57:34.604 --> 00:57:34.905]  You bet.
[00:57:34.905 --> 00:57:36.025]  Take care, my friend.
[00:57:36.025 --> 00:57:36.646]  What a character.
[00:57:37.905 --> 00:57:39.626]  I ended up doing two segments with him.
[00:57:39.626 --> 00:57:43.088]  Alright folks, we're gonna come back and get to all your calls.
[00:57:43.088 --> 00:57:46.310]  And then we got a well-known sports writer joining us coming up.
[00:57:46.310 --> 00:57:49.851]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:57:49.851 --> 00:57:50.892]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:57:50.892 --> 00:57:54.234]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[00:57:54.234 --> 00:57:55.614]  And we knew what to do.
[00:58:06.761 --> 00:58:08.023]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:58:08.023 --> 00:58:14.371]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:58:15.052 --> 00:58:23.961]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:58:23.961 --> 00:58:31.048]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:58:31.048 --> 00:58:34.111]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:58:34.111 --> 00:58:39.276]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:58:39.976 --> 00:58:43.077]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:58:43.077 --> 00:58:48.978]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:58:48.978 --> 00:58:52.038]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:58:52.038 --> 00:59:01.020]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:03.420]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:06.181]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:12.837 --> 00:59:14.138]  Big Brother.
[00:59:14.138 --> 00:59:15.919]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:15.919 --> 00:59:17.660]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:19.241]  You want answers?
[00:59:19.241 --> 00:59:20.802]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:20.802 --> 00:59:25.005]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:25.005 --> 00:59:30.448]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:30.448 --> 00:59:37.132]  We have the White House Press Secretary again saying that the U.S.
[00:59:37.132 --> 00:59:38.193]  government has never tortured.
[00:59:40.333 --> 00:59:50.797]  Then they go on to direct the press to government documents where they say that waterboarding and other forms of torture are not torture.
[00:59:50.797 --> 00:59:53.718]  Kind of like taking your pension fund isn't going to be taking your pension fund.
[00:59:53.718 --> 00:59:57.940]  It's going to be protecting your pension fund.
[00:59:57.940 --> 00:59:59.500]  Alright, let's get through calls.
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:01.341]  I want to take a lot of calls.
[01:00:01.341 --> 01:00:05.783]  Again, in this hour, we do have quite a few audio clips coming up.
[01:00:05.783 --> 01:00:09.424]  David Zirin, well-known
[01:00:11.329 --> 01:00:12.650]  Sports reporter.
[01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:15.210]  Also mixes politics into what he does.
[01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:22.693]  He got tracked by the government for being involved in a mainline Democratic Party activity.
[01:00:22.693 --> 01:00:29.775]  So we'll have you have a chance to hear him tell that story coming up in the next hour.
[01:00:29.775 --> 01:00:35.978]  And then Dr. Stephen Jones and David Ray Griffin on the 9-11 front in the fourth hour today.
[01:00:35.978 --> 01:00:39.979]  But let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:00:41.351 --> 01:00:48.713]  Let's go ahead and talk to, I guess, Chris in Arkansas is up next, and then to Leah.
[01:00:48.713 --> 01:00:50.673]  Go ahead, Chris.
[01:00:50.673 --> 01:00:56.874]  Alex, I just want to thank you very much for all you have done and been listening to you since 1999.
[01:00:56.874 --> 01:01:09.797]  All you've said has either come true or has been true, and most of it I didn't believe at first, but I did my own research, my own reading, and I was actually shocked to find out how many ways and how far and how much we were
[01:01:10.456 --> 01:01:13.638]  Under attack and just devastated me.
[01:01:13.638 --> 01:01:17.820]  I've been told by quite a few people don't believe me.
[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:20.062]  People think I'm crazy.
[01:01:20.062 --> 01:01:25.165]  But you know in the military we took an oath to defend against both foreign and domestic enemies.
[01:01:25.165 --> 01:01:27.486]  So I'm kind of committed to this.
[01:01:27.486 --> 01:01:36.952]  My questions for you is there's a lot of people out here who are they're lucky to make their they're lucky to make any kind of money during the week and they're trying to
[01:01:38.343 --> 01:01:39.384]  Well, I mean, I'm no genius.
[01:01:39.384 --> 01:01:43.506]  Everybody understands their local environment better than somebody off in Austin, Texas does, but stop eating out.
[01:02:06.977 --> 01:02:09.838]  Make food themselves.
[01:02:09.838 --> 01:02:14.558]  While they still can, sell all the junk they've got in the garage.
[01:02:14.558 --> 01:02:21.340]  I mean, even people that don't have a lot of extra income a lot of times have more stuff than they think they do.
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:22.300]  Sell it on eBay.
[01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:28.501]  If they don't have a computer, you know, sell it at a local swap meet.
[01:02:28.501 --> 01:02:34.202]  And then just realize that the biggest issue is
[01:02:35.402 --> 01:02:44.170]  Being able to feed themselves and take care of their family and not be stampeded by rioting crowds if society does totally break down.
[01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:45.711]  And that may happen.
[01:02:45.711 --> 01:02:51.516]  Undoubtedly, we're going to have a long, deep recession leading into a depression.
[01:02:51.516 --> 01:02:53.097]  The question is, how bad will it get?
[01:02:53.097 --> 01:02:57.581]  And every indicator is... You know, I keep asking the question of the audience.
[01:02:57.581 --> 01:03:03.306]  Why do you think the elite doesn't care now and is just stealing $5 trillion in front of you and won't say where $2 trillion went?
[01:03:04.588 --> 01:03:07.452]  Openly bringing in the military to police the American people.
[01:03:07.452 --> 01:03:11.177]  And it's because all the evidence is that they are going for Brooke.
[01:03:11.177 --> 01:03:13.620]  They wouldn't be emerging with the world government.
[01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:18.447]  They wouldn't be, you know, surfacing and showing everybody if they weren't going to go ahead and do it all.
[01:03:19.914 --> 01:03:26.258]  And so I would also tell people, our mission is more than just protecting ourselves, to help others.
[01:03:26.258 --> 01:03:31.480]  And so I would also worry about other people, and then God has a way of taking care of people to do that.
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:37.844]  And so people need to not just get ready, not just hide out, but try to speak out and get the word out.
[01:03:37.844 --> 01:03:44.167]  Call and talk radio, putting out flyers, emailing people, links to video clips on the web.
[01:03:44.167 --> 01:03:45.868]  You know, whatever you can to wake people up.
[01:03:45.868 --> 01:03:47.029]  Talking to folks at your church.
[01:03:48.294 --> 01:03:51.439]  And we may be able to back this thing off.
[01:03:51.439 --> 01:03:53.021]  So stay there.
[01:03:53.021 --> 01:03:58.910]  We'll come back to you and see if we have any other comments to that when we get back with Chris in Arkansas.
[01:03:58.910 --> 01:04:03.317]  Then we'll talk to Tulia, Brad, Paul, and others.
[01:04:03.317 --> 01:04:03.797]  Stay with me.
[01:04:08.803 --> 01:04:10.465]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:10.465 --> 01:04:15.231]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:04:15.231 --> 01:04:18.174]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:04:18.174 --> 01:04:21.238]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:04:21.238 --> 01:04:25.964]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:04:26.164 --> 01:04:27.365]  If you simply prepare.
[01:04:27.365 --> 01:04:31.088]  Our elective representatives wanted a good ol' boy bailout for the special interest.
[01:04:31.088 --> 01:04:33.149]  So they ignored your screams not to do it.
[01:04:33.149 --> 01:04:34.991]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[01:04:34.991 --> 01:04:38.954]  They voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out of thin air.
[01:04:38.954 --> 01:04:41.776]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[01:04:41.776 --> 01:04:47.980]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities.
[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:50.923]  Particularly food, beyond many Americans reach.
[01:04:50.923 --> 01:04:55.426]  In pre-Nazi Germany superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days.
[01:04:55.646 --> 01:04:57.987]  Until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[01:04:57.987 --> 01:05:02.450]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:08.133]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[01:05:08.133 --> 01:05:11.374]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[01:05:11.374 --> 01:05:14.516]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[01:05:14.736 --> 01:05:16.537]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[01:05:16.537 --> 01:05:20.618]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[01:05:20.618 --> 01:05:24.739]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[01:05:24.739 --> 01:05:32.281]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[01:05:32.281 --> 01:05:36.222]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[01:05:36.222 --> 01:05:39.083]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.

[01:06:12.477 --> 01:06:13.617]  Take action today.
[01:06:13.617 --> 01:06:17.741]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:06:17.741 --> 01:06:24.386]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:06:24.386 --> 01:06:27.348]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.301]  All right, let's go back to your phone calls.
[01:06:41.301 --> 01:06:44.222]  Chris in Arkansas, go ahead.
[01:06:44.222 --> 01:06:51.726]  Alex, the other thing, I moved from Austin to Little Rock and I kind of feel like I'm in the hotbed of where a lot of these things have originated.
[01:06:51.726 --> 01:07:04.493]  So I'm kind of amazed, but now I'm kind of wondering about if the bankers, the power brokers are intentionally hoping that someone will start some trouble somewhere so that they can implement martial law.
[01:07:05.285 --> 01:07:14.158]  And then just kill the United States in that way through anarchy or just as the continuance of government goes and what your comments will be on that and I'll take it off the air.
[01:07:14.158 --> 01:07:15.300]  Okay, I appreciate your call.
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:17.520]  No, that's it.
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:39.514]  I mean, if the public acquiesces and just lets them take the pension funds and bankrupt everything and then basically all businesses will get government funds to pay their employees at subsistence level and we'll all be micromanaged and the bankers will turn the money spigots back on for a while to kind of inebriate us while they dine on our hindquarters.
[01:07:43.602 --> 01:07:44.162]  Absolutely.
[01:07:44.162 --> 01:07:47.304]  I mean, that's why they're training every local police department in the nation.
[01:07:47.304 --> 01:07:49.765]  The feds are for IEDs.
[01:07:49.765 --> 01:07:54.266]  Roadside, uh, you know, improvised explosive devices.
[01:07:54.266 --> 01:08:02.950]  They are, uh, I mean, literally running around all paranoid, like they're just terrorists everywhere, and it's the American people, and it's white Al-Qaeda, and they're gonna get you.
[01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:10.053]  Because the social planners, the social engineers have admittedly done big war games on how far they can push the public
[01:08:11.255 --> 01:08:13.577]  When the public is going to start striking back.
[01:08:13.577 --> 01:08:28.268]  Last weekend the Associated Press had a big article with Homeland Security saying our main threat now isn't terrorists, it's the American people angry over the economy attacking government facilities.
[01:08:28.268 --> 01:08:38.856]  And they said conversely we're really worried about people mad at the government doing something during the four million Kool-Aid drinkers going to worship
[01:08:39.671 --> 01:08:42.275]  Uh, the new puppet, Barack Obama.
[01:08:42.275 --> 01:08:45.921]  So, they're publicly converting the whole Homeland Security apparatus.
[01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:47.443]  It was always for us.
[01:08:48.217 --> 01:08:49.777]  And we always told people it was for us.
[01:08:49.777 --> 01:08:52.078]  It was in the white papers and government documents.
[01:08:52.078 --> 01:09:01.139]  But publicly it was for shadow men in hiding in caves who always pop up at key election points or always pop up to second the CIA.
[01:09:01.139 --> 01:09:04.600]  All these Al-Qaeda guys are popping up with new videos and audio tapes.
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:08.841]  They're always put out by the very same intelligence agency fronts.
[01:09:08.841 --> 01:09:10.541]  Computer experts look at the videos.
[01:09:10.541 --> 01:09:14.202]  This is mainstream news and, you know, the Al-Qaeda watermark.
[01:09:15.535 --> 01:09:19.138]  Logo is laid in, you know, with the Intel Center's watermark.
[01:09:19.138 --> 01:09:21.440]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:25.302]  Yes, they are releasing the videos themselves.
[01:09:25.302 --> 01:09:27.244]  It's produced by the same people.
[01:09:27.244 --> 01:09:27.704]  Understand?
[01:09:27.704 --> 01:09:33.228]  I mean, it's just so cynical.
[01:09:33.228 --> 01:09:36.330]  Very, very cynical.
[01:09:36.330 --> 01:09:41.734]  You know, I'm going to go back to Tulia, Chris, Paul, Anthony here in just a moment, but we had a caller last hour
[01:09:43.877 --> 01:09:46.659]  Who was asking about what will Obama do?
[01:09:46.659 --> 01:09:50.222]  Obama will do everything George Bush did.
[01:09:50.222 --> 01:09:51.623]  Because it's the same agenda.
[01:09:51.623 --> 01:09:55.005]  It's not George Bush's agenda or Barack Obama's agenda.
[01:09:55.005 --> 01:10:01.129]  It is the multinational Fortune 100 bought and paid for by the private banking families.
[01:10:01.129 --> 01:10:03.911]  Less than 20 families.
[01:10:03.911 --> 01:10:05.012]  They are cold-blooded.
[01:10:05.012 --> 01:10:06.713]  They don't like people.
[01:10:06.713 --> 01:10:07.694]  They're eugenicists.
[01:10:07.694 --> 01:10:08.875]  They believe we're a scourge.
[01:10:08.875 --> 01:10:10.936]  They believe we all need to be killed anyways.
[01:10:10.936 --> 01:10:13.458]  So anything they do, they feel good about.
[01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:16.762]  And then you understand.
[01:10:16.762 --> 01:10:19.544]  They feel good about 3 million dead Iraqis.
[01:10:19.544 --> 01:10:24.208]  They feel good about dead Americans.
[01:10:24.208 --> 01:10:26.970]  That's a job well done for them.
[01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:35.858]  They feel good about putting police chiefs in charge in crime labs nationwide who frame anybody they want, but then release hundreds of thousands per state
[01:10:36.661 --> 01:10:39.463]  Hundreds per thousands per year just in Houston alone.
[01:10:39.463 --> 01:10:45.646]  Violent illegal aliens who have raped and murdered and stolen and molested children.
[01:10:45.646 --> 01:10:49.028]  That was all in the Houston Chronicle, Monday.
[01:10:49.028 --> 01:10:51.250]  It's in there all the time.
[01:10:51.250 --> 01:10:53.271]  Citizens have got to be hurt.
[01:10:53.271 --> 01:10:55.352]  Citizens have got to be bankrupted.
[01:10:55.352 --> 01:10:58.374]  Citizens have got to be squeezed and taught who the boss is.
[01:10:58.374 --> 01:10:59.915]  We're the bad Americans!
[01:11:00.823 --> 01:11:27.635]  Everything was about setting a trap, getting us to trust government, getting us to be bleeding heart liberals, getting us on the government trough, getting control of our lives, turning our children against us, then getting us all in debt to the point where they could bankrupt the whole society, and then point the working class at the nouveau riche, at the upper middle class, and say, that's the rich, let's loot them, they cause the economy to have the problems.
[01:11:28.504 --> 01:11:40.353]  And then they're going to stick the blue-collar, now in shiny, fancy uniforms, on the middle class, and they are going to rape you financially, and they are going to take everything you've got!
[01:11:40.353 --> 01:11:55.105]  They're going to take your pension funds, they're going to take your savings, they're going to turn a horde of blue-collar people loose on you, just like the Founding Fathers warned you, the howl of the mob, the mad howl of democracy.
[01:11:57.092 --> 01:12:08.117]  Now, there's no democracy in positioning this and setting this up, but then in the final equation, they turn the mob loose on the middle class.
[01:12:08.117 --> 01:12:14.559]  And they will slit your throat in the middle of the street for a dollar.
[01:12:14.559 --> 01:12:16.700]  And so, that's what Barack Obama is going to do.
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:18.601]  He is going to be the messianic savior.
[01:12:18.601 --> 01:12:20.482]  The economy imploding is going to be blamed on Bush.
[01:12:21.309 --> 01:12:42.175]  He is going to give people government jobs, welfare, they're going to accelerate the currency, they're going to devalue it, they're going to give the devaluing currency to the public for Taco Bell tacos and 12-packs and cases of Bud Light, and they are going to turn them loose on you.
[01:12:42.175 --> 01:12:44.076]  I mean, it's not going to be pretty.
[01:12:44.076 --> 01:12:45.656]  That's what I'm really most concerned about.
[01:12:49.568 --> 01:13:01.097]  And already, I mean, it's all over the news, the left is suddenly, yeah, don't think Obama isn't tough, he's going into Pakistan and Iran if he needs to, and he's going into Afghanistan.
[01:13:01.097 --> 01:13:01.957]  And yeah, you know what?
[01:13:01.957 --> 01:13:03.538]  We're gonna get tough with terrorists.
[01:13:03.538 --> 01:13:07.101]  We're gonna take the gloves off, and people are like, man, maybe I like torture now.
[01:13:07.101 --> 01:13:08.162]  Maybe I like spying.
[01:13:10.592 --> 01:13:13.675]  You see, they teach you to hate Bush.
[01:13:13.675 --> 01:13:18.719]  The media lets you know about the torture and let you know about 9-11 and let you know about all of this.
[01:13:18.719 --> 01:13:20.100]  They let it out on the down low.
[01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:22.722]  As I told you on the day of 9-11, they were going to allow this out.
[01:13:22.722 --> 01:13:23.623]  Blame it on America.
[01:13:23.623 --> 01:13:31.729]  Let Henry Paulson come out and say, we're sorry the American government let you down and we're sorry the American people were lazy and greedy.
[01:13:31.729 --> 01:13:33.371]  We're sorry, world.
[01:13:33.371 --> 01:13:34.912]  We will now pay.
[01:13:34.912 --> 01:13:38.355]  We will now devalue our currency and put the money into your coffers
[01:13:39.565 --> 01:13:43.246]  Before it's devalued, it's our fault.
[01:13:43.246 --> 01:13:48.488]  See, the globalists didn't like the czars, so they slaughtered 60 million and did it in Russia.
[01:13:48.488 --> 01:13:50.068]  They didn't like the Chinese people.
[01:13:50.068 --> 01:13:56.430]  They'd thrown off the control by the colonial system, so they sent in the commies.
[01:13:56.430 --> 01:13:59.551]  They killed 85 mil.
[01:13:59.551 --> 01:14:00.892]  Now, the news says 60 mil.
[01:14:00.892 --> 01:14:02.572]  The Chinese government says 80 mil.
[01:14:02.572 --> 01:14:04.893]  They're actually proud of it.
[01:14:04.893 --> 01:14:05.713]  Go pull it up.
[01:14:05.713 --> 01:14:06.514]  Go do research on it.
[01:14:06.514 --> 01:14:07.414]  Find out I'm telling you the truth.
[01:14:08.217 --> 01:14:09.657]  And see, they want to do that here.
[01:14:09.657 --> 01:14:12.578]  They want to show you who boss is.
[01:14:12.578 --> 01:14:20.180]  And they will turn the starving hordes loose on you.
[01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:22.661]  And if you run to other countries, they're going to do it there too.
[01:14:22.661 --> 01:14:31.643]  Anybody with money, unless you're living in Dubai, or the Cook Islands, or Switzerland.
[01:14:31.643 --> 01:14:33.964]  And they're not going to let you in unless you've got hundreds of millions.
[01:14:34.714 --> 01:14:38.036]  You're there to be thrown in the lions.
[01:14:38.036 --> 01:14:42.098]  And then Obama, like it's a gladiatorial arena, he's gonna be up there laughing!
[01:14:42.098 --> 01:14:45.279]  They're gonna love him!
[01:14:45.279 --> 01:14:45.779]  You understand?
[01:14:45.779 --> 01:14:54.003]  And they're gonna bring in carbon taxes and tax and regulate everybody.
[01:14:54.003 --> 01:14:59.546]  But all the poor people standing at bus stops, they're not gonna care.
[01:14:59.546 --> 01:15:02.007]  Because on the news, they're gonna see people in million-dollar houses
[01:15:02.921 --> 01:15:07.904]  Having their homes repossessed and, you know, handed over to local government people.
[01:15:07.904 --> 01:15:08.765]  It's bad, folks.
[01:15:08.765 --> 01:15:14.849]  I mean, the people that ran Lenin, the people that ran Hitler, the people that ran Mao, they're in control here, and they mean bad.
[01:15:14.849 --> 01:15:16.890]  They want to hurt you bad.
[01:15:16.890 --> 01:15:24.014]  And I'm sorry if that's scary and people don't want to believe it, but that's one scenario.
[01:15:24.014 --> 01:15:26.256]  That's the most dangerous scenario.
[01:15:26.256 --> 01:15:29.638]  If the people rebel and resist and speak out and say no at every level,
[01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:56.143]  Then what they're going to do is let Obama get a lot done for two years, get a carbon tax in, regulation, stage some terror attacks, start going after militias and claiming that they're in bed with white supremacists, and they'll stage some racial crimes and have some hate speech laws passed, and they'll start shutting the web down, get more people on welfare, and then they'll have some scandals and burn Obama.
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:01.242]  And, uh, we'll bring a Republican in in four years, but I don't see that happening.
[01:16:01.242 --> 01:16:04.623]  Because I've never seen them call somebody a messiah.
[01:16:04.623 --> 01:16:12.326]  I've never seen them... set something up like this, unless it was Mao or Hitler.
[01:16:12.326 --> 01:16:13.827]  Or Lenin.
[01:16:13.827 --> 01:16:19.049]  I mean, they are saying he is the one, Obama-mania, president of the world, the man that will fix it all, the one.
[01:16:19.049 --> 01:16:26.692]  Uh, let's go to your calls here, uh, Tulia in, uh, or Tula in New Mexico, welcome.
[01:16:27.611 --> 01:16:28.511]  Hello.
[01:16:28.511 --> 01:16:29.292]  Hi.
[01:16:29.292 --> 01:16:30.752]  Hi.
[01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:35.314]  Alex, have you ever heard of someone named Lance von Liebensfeld?
[01:16:35.314 --> 01:16:35.675]  I have.
[01:16:35.675 --> 01:16:37.996]  Refresh my memory.
[01:16:37.996 --> 01:16:39.356]  He published a magazine.
[01:16:39.356 --> 01:16:46.019]  Well, to back it up a little bit, did you hear about what Obama had in his pocket the night he got elected?
[01:16:46.019 --> 01:16:46.740]  No.
[01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:49.361]  He had some trinkets, okay?
[01:16:49.361 --> 01:16:56.364]  And it came out on CNN the next day, and what it was was a Hindu deity, a monkey.
[01:16:57.644 --> 01:17:14.840]  And if you go back to the works of Lance von Liebensfeld, who published a magazine in Germany predating the beginning of the Third Reich, he was a mentor of Adolf Hitler's, and he had a magazine called the Estara.
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.482]  Yes, now I know who he is.
[01:17:16.482 --> 01:17:19.525]  And he had a big New Age temple in Berlin.
[01:17:19.525 --> 01:17:22.888]  Right, and he published a book called of Sodom's Monkey.
[01:17:24.429 --> 01:17:39.598]  Which really became the protocol for the Thule and Viril Society, but it was also the beginning of, not really the beginning of the Eugenic Society, because the Eugenic Society began in New England in 1927.
[01:17:39.598 --> 01:17:52.206]  My tribe, which I don't want to mention their name right now, we found all the paperwork on the Eugenic Society, of the defective humans, but basically Lonson Liebensfeld's whole thesis
[01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:57.925]  About Sodom's monkey, which is why Obama had it in his pocket.
[01:17:57.925 --> 01:17:59.727]  You know how they talk in codes?
[01:17:59.727 --> 01:18:00.508]  Yeah.
[01:18:00.508 --> 01:18:05.974]  They talk to each other in codes and then they put all this other garbage, the big stuff out.
[01:18:05.974 --> 01:18:07.316]  I think they call it a sigil.
[01:18:07.316 --> 01:18:09.338]  They like focus their energies on the little idols.
[01:18:09.338 --> 01:18:12.402]  Like all the Bohemian Grove members worship these owls in their houses.
[01:18:13.445 --> 01:18:14.306]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[01:18:14.306 --> 01:18:16.367]  I want to hear more about... The Loving Monkey.
[01:18:31.039 --> 01:18:37.985]  A place where you find shelter, protection, food, water, medicine and warmth you prepared for yourself.
[01:18:37.985 --> 01:18:43.209]  It is defensible and is put together with a realistic understanding of what the dangers will be.
[01:18:43.209 --> 01:18:45.791]  Ragnar Benson also said, why retreat?
[01:18:46.411 --> 01:18:50.953]  This is a question that 90% of our population cannot and will not answer.
[01:18:50.953 --> 01:18:56.735]  If they could, that same 90% would have to admit that things may not continue on as they are now.
[01:18:56.735 --> 01:18:59.596]  They would also have to admit that they will need a retreat.
[01:18:59.596 --> 01:19:03.277]  Something completely impossible for the average American to do.

[01:19:20.884 --> 01:19:25.787]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:19:25.787 --> 01:19:28.609]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:19:28.609 --> 01:19:31.411]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:19:31.411 --> 01:19:34.573]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:19:34.573 --> 01:19:41.918]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.

[01:19:57.977 --> 01:19:58.758]  They're not after money.
[01:19:58.758 --> 01:20:00.039]  They have all the money they need.
[01:20:00.039 --> 01:20:00.999]  They're after power.
[01:20:00.999 --> 01:20:02.160]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:20:13.690 --> 01:20:14.897]  You have been warned.
[01:20:15.618 --> 01:20:17.399]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[01:20:17.399 --> 01:20:19.601]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[01:20:19.601 --> 01:20:21.383]  I can't find my wallet!
[01:20:21.383 --> 01:20:22.223]  Sound familiar?
[01:20:22.223 --> 01:20:25.686]  Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead?

[01:21:09.161 --> 01:21:10.002]  We're good to go.
[01:21:35.379 --> 01:21:35.840]  I think so.
[01:21:55.421 --> 01:21:56.862]  Has he been trying to dump that wine, Fred?
[01:21:56.862 --> 01:21:58.143]  Much too long, street girl!
[01:22:37.418 --> 01:22:45.544]  Well, I don't know about little magic trinkets in Obama's pocket.
[01:22:45.544 --> 01:22:58.833]  I know Hillary wears Kabbalah bracelets, and Madonna does, and all these Hollywood stars have got Kabbalah occultic stuff tattooed all over them, whatever.
[01:23:00.234 --> 01:23:01.995]  I mean, this is big.
[01:23:01.995 --> 01:23:11.818]  But I'll check into the, uh, Fool's Society, uh, Monkey, uh, you know, CNN announcing, ooh, he has something a little special in his pocket.
[01:23:11.818 --> 01:23:19.741]  We've had Tex Meyers talk about how they, uh, in buildings they build, you know, they put these little secret chambers in to put similar things in them.
[01:23:19.741 --> 01:23:22.302]  But, um, I know his actions.
[01:23:23.286 --> 01:23:34.256]  He immediately got hundreds of millions of dollars that Bush, from political pressure, he had to do a few things, cut from the United Nations that was used in China for forced abortion.
[01:23:34.256 --> 01:23:36.918]  Now, the news uses the term coerced abortion.
[01:23:36.918 --> 01:23:39.700]  I mean, they kill the baby in front of you.
[01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:41.602]  They drown the babies.
[01:23:41.602 --> 01:23:42.262]  In some cases.
[01:23:42.262 --> 01:23:45.365]  In others, they just fine you.
[01:23:45.365 --> 01:23:47.067]  Huge amounts of money.
[01:23:47.067 --> 01:23:49.729]  And then take your child to be raised in a government facility.
[01:23:50.791 --> 01:23:57.854]  And people actually went on Infowars.com in the comments section and said, Oh, you just don't like Obama, so what do they?
[01:23:57.854 --> 01:24:00.495]  Coerced is not forced!
[01:24:00.495 --> 01:24:03.877]  You know, just living in total denial about China.
[01:24:03.877 --> 01:24:10.480]  So... I know he's doing that in China and in Africa, and the eugenics money is flowing.
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:13.121]  Now, to be technical, the article didn't get into that.
[01:24:13.121 --> 01:24:14.542]  See, it makes it partisan.
[01:24:14.542 --> 01:24:17.363]  Bush cut the funding one place, but then increased it in another.
[01:24:18.502 --> 01:24:23.984]  So, what he did was a bait-and-switch, or, you know, he just simply moved it.
[01:24:23.984 --> 01:24:26.965]  A shell game is the proper term.
[01:24:26.965 --> 01:24:46.293]  But I know that the real eugenics societies were set up in 1846 by Sir Francis Galton, and then there were societies set up at the turn of the last century, and then through the 20s, Cold Springs Harbor, where it's the IBM Eugenics Human Genome Project today, and it's openly eugenics,
[01:24:47.117 --> 01:24:50.698]  They study their race-specific bioweapons.
[01:24:50.698 --> 01:24:55.699]  But you were making your point about the little... Do you remember the headline?
[01:24:55.699 --> 01:24:57.159]  Because I'll Google that right now.
[01:24:57.159 --> 01:24:58.379]  I want to look that up.
[01:24:58.379 --> 01:25:03.900]  Well, it was on CNN, in the news, on the television, but basically it's a Hahnemann.
[01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:13.482]  And this Hahnemann, what I'm trying to explain, is a principle, an esoteric principle, of course, which connotates the defective humans.
[01:25:14.810 --> 01:25:28.580]  With my tribe, when the Eugenics Society came up in the state of New England, they went down, they did a door-to-door statistical study of 250 families, which they called defective humans.
[01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:36.326]  And they had long hair, they wrote down they had moccasins, they did beadwork, and then these families, 250 of them disappeared.
[01:25:38.628 --> 01:25:47.412]  Oh, I know, it's on CBC right now that they still go arrest the health department, the native children, and they just take them to a camp and kill them.
[01:25:47.412 --> 01:25:50.513]  And then I tell people that, I mean, that's on CBC.
[01:25:50.513 --> 01:25:53.715]  And then nothing happens, the government just goes, yeah, we're killing them, and that's the way it is.
[01:25:53.715 --> 01:26:03.579]  Well, George Bush Sr., as you know then, ran the eugenics operations in the 70s, and the government's own number, 44% of native women were sterilized.
[01:26:03.579 --> 01:26:03.739]  Yes.
[01:26:06.039 --> 01:26:10.160]  On reservations and people laugh and email me going, oh they conked him on the head?
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:11.201]  No!
[01:26:11.201 --> 01:26:21.904]  The health department came around with police and threw him in chains and took him like you take a wild animal and uh... and uh... carried out all sorts of things on him.
[01:26:21.904 --> 01:26:33.808]  Well we've had 50, 50 suicides since January ranging from six years old to 18 hanging themselves with dog collars and all these kids have cell phones.
[01:26:35.592 --> 01:26:38.733]  On one, this is just on one reservation.
[01:26:38.733 --> 01:26:39.733]  Fifty.
[01:26:39.733 --> 01:26:45.234]  Yeah, I met a six-year-old kid, tried to hang himself and was saved last week.
[01:26:45.234 --> 01:26:46.514]  That's mind control.
[01:26:46.514 --> 01:26:47.134]  Yeah.
[01:26:47.134 --> 01:26:58.397]  I mean, we have been experiencing the New World Order, but to get back to what Berg was saying the other day about Barry, that George H.W.
[01:26:58.397 --> 01:27:01.577]  Bush is not a Bush.
[01:27:01.577 --> 01:27:04.098]  He was born in Germany.
[01:27:04.935 --> 01:27:07.957]  He was adopted by Prescott Bush.
[01:27:07.957 --> 01:27:14.641]  And I'm looking at a picture right here, which I would love to send you, because I don't think you've probably seen this.
[01:27:14.641 --> 01:27:28.189]  He was adopted, and I'm looking at a picture of him with Borman, as an 18-year-old young guy, before he came to America, and Mengele, and the Scherff family.
[01:27:28.189 --> 01:27:30.270]  That's who he is.
[01:27:30.270 --> 01:27:32.652]  George H. W. Bush is not a Bush.
[01:27:33.246 --> 01:27:34.307]  He was adopted.
[01:27:34.307 --> 01:27:40.091]  Well, I knew that Prescott was the head Nazi bag man in the United States.
[01:27:40.091 --> 01:27:41.272]  That's a fact.
[01:27:41.272 --> 01:27:47.557]  And I know, in Tex Marz that makes stuff up, he's confirmed, they have their own private church outside Houston.
[01:27:47.557 --> 01:27:52.001]  And it's a big, baby blue background with a swastika inside.
[01:27:52.001 --> 01:27:55.183]  And that's their own private family church there.
[01:27:55.183 --> 01:28:02.129]  So, I know the Skull and Bones is a Germanic death cult society at Yale.
[01:28:03.383 --> 01:28:04.426]  But send me that.
[01:28:04.426 --> 01:28:06.911]  Send that to Aaron at Infowars.
[01:28:06.911 --> 01:28:08.314]  We're on the march.
[01:28:08.314 --> 01:28:10.839]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:10.839 --> 01:28:13.544]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:16.539 --> 01:28:21.881]  HempUSA.org is now offering free shipping worldwide to better serve our customers.
[01:28:21.881 --> 01:28:28.323]  Our goal is to get these fine hemp products to you in the least amount of time so you can enjoy what the powder seeds and oil can do for you.
[01:28:28.323 --> 01:28:30.843]  HempUSA.org has a warning that the U.S.
[01:28:30.843 --> 01:28:36.145]  food supplies are dangerously low and we urge you to protect your family with hemp storable foods today.
[01:28:36.145 --> 01:28:37.565]  Tomorrow may be too late.
[01:28:37.565 --> 01:28:42.087]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit HempUSA.org.
[01:28:42.087 --> 01:28:46.368]  This incredible food source is loaded with enzymes so your body can digest the food you eat.
[01:28:46.528 --> 01:28:47.008]  We're good to go!
[01:29:16.284 --> 01:29:23.032]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:29:23.032 --> 01:29:25.675]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:29:25.675 --> 01:29:27.237]  But who is the enemy?
[01:29:27.237 --> 01:29:28.017]  Bin Laden.
[01:29:28.017 --> 01:29:29.099]  This is his MO.
[01:29:29.099 --> 01:29:30.420]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:32.002]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:29:32.362 --> 01:29:39.527]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:29:39.527 --> 01:29:40.007]  Some U.S.
[01:29:40.007 --> 01:29:46.372]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:29:46.372 --> 01:29:49.874]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:29:49.874 --> 01:30:00.361]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:30:00.361 --> 01:30:01.082]  Fabled Enemies.
[01:30:01.562 --> 01:30:12.724]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists!
[01:30:16.312 --> 01:30:19.755]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:30:19.755 --> 01:30:23.999]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:30:23.999 --> 01:30:35.688]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:30:35.688 --> 01:30:41.493]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:30:41.733 --> 01:30:42.374]  We're good to go.
[01:31:02.086 --> 01:31:07.730]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:31:07.730 --> 01:31:10.052]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:31:39.352 --> 01:32:04.785]  I'll tell you, man, our guests, we go over it and over it with them, and they just can't ever get time zones straight, which is fine with me, I don't care, but we're going to probably have Dave Zirin on later in this hour and then early into the next hour instead of next hour, because he's calling us up thinking that we, that he was supposed to be on 30 minutes ago, but c'est la vie, it doesn't even really matter.
[01:32:04.785 --> 01:32:07.407]  I want to go ahead and play this clip, this is himself on
[01:32:09.056 --> 01:32:32.827]  on CNN and he's talking about some of the things that happened to him but but first the host explains to you in the piece on CNN that they're changing the Patriot Act administratively
[01:32:34.506 --> 01:32:35.567]  Bush is.
[01:32:35.567 --> 01:32:36.648]  It's all his fault.
[01:32:36.648 --> 01:32:40.331]  It's just because he's a Republican and because he's an evil white guy.
[01:32:40.331 --> 01:32:44.655]  To where they can spy on anybody and everybody domestically.
[01:32:44.655 --> 01:32:46.517]  The state police can with federal funds.
[01:32:46.517 --> 01:32:47.978]  That's actually what it states.
[01:32:47.978 --> 01:32:49.559]  Or the feds can.
[01:32:49.559 --> 01:32:51.601]  No warrants.
[01:32:51.601 --> 01:32:53.603]  No investigations.
[01:32:53.603 --> 01:32:57.006]  Even non-terror related, non-crime related.
[01:32:57.006 --> 01:32:58.267]  I covered this some last week.
[01:32:59.748 --> 01:33:02.609]  Non-crime related.
[01:33:02.609 --> 01:33:17.712]  This has been on CNN, MSNBC, CNBC and they say in Raw Story and all these other places, oh Obama can't overturn it because Bush just did it and something a president does 60 days, you know, becomes law with an executive order.
[01:33:17.712 --> 01:33:19.273]  No it doesn't!
[01:33:19.273 --> 01:33:24.854]  Obama could overturn any of this but everywhere is this PR that Obama fought the bailout but it still happened.
[01:33:26.087 --> 01:33:30.828]  Obama fought the expansion of the Patriot Act, but Bush did it!
[01:33:30.828 --> 01:33:35.010]  Bush, he just keeps doing everything!
[01:33:35.010 --> 01:33:37.270]  And the public has no idea how government works.
[01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:37.890]  They have no idea.
[01:33:37.890 --> 01:33:42.712]  This is a ball-faced lie!
[01:33:42.712 --> 01:33:47.933]  So see, they make it all about the evil right-winger.
[01:33:47.933 --> 01:33:51.054]  So I wanted to ask David Zirin, who is a great writer,
[01:33:52.845 --> 01:33:56.508]  Sports writer, also political writer, writes for The Nation and a bunch of other publications.
[01:33:56.508 --> 01:34:02.473]  I mean, are they going to be concerned about Barack Obama when all this stuff continues and expands under him?
[01:34:02.473 --> 01:34:04.634]  Or is it all just about George Bush?
[01:34:04.634 --> 01:34:08.137]  Because, see, I mean, I'm upset about the spying and the secret police.
[01:34:08.137 --> 01:34:10.258]  You know, I understand the President's a puppet.
[01:34:10.258 --> 01:34:12.180]  See, I grew up a long time ago.
[01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:14.462]  And so I'm asking them, I mean, have you grown up?
[01:34:14.462 --> 01:34:16.824]  Or is it all about the big, bad George Bush?
[01:34:16.824 --> 01:34:19.746]  And we'll just get George Bush pinatas out and we'll hit on them.
[01:34:21.775 --> 01:34:25.999]  I mean, I'm saying Barack Obama's a puppet, and so people are going, what are you for, Obama?
[01:34:25.999 --> 01:34:27.640]  We need to focus in more on him!
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:30.042]  No, he's a puppet too!
[01:34:30.042 --> 01:34:33.305]  They don't, the establishment doesn't want you knowing that they're puppets.
[01:34:33.305 --> 01:34:37.528]  They want to make it all about them, instead of about who pulls their strings.
[01:34:37.528 --> 01:34:42.712]  So we'll play this clip, then go to your calls, and then we'll get Dave Zirin on.
[01:34:42.712 --> 01:34:43.173]  Here we go.
[01:34:49.918 --> 01:34:56.082]  Before President Bush rides back to his ranch in Texas, he hopes to finalize over 90 new federal regulations.
[01:34:56.082 --> 01:35:06.648]  Now in truth, finalizing regulations at the last minute is common practice among outgoing presidents, but the Bush administration is hoping to expand it and making their final regulation adjustments more permanent.
[01:35:07.148 --> 01:35:08.810]  Why stop now, after all?
[01:35:08.810 --> 01:35:15.175]  The president has accelerated the process to try to ensure that the changes he wants will be finalized by November 22nd.
[01:35:15.175 --> 01:35:18.738]  That's 60 days before the Obama administration takes control.
[01:35:18.738 --> 01:35:25.324]  That's dubiously convenient timing, because most federal rules take effect 60 days after they've been finalized.
[01:35:25.324 --> 01:35:27.485]  So then they're harder to turn back.
[01:35:27.485 --> 01:35:29.187]  Here you go, President Obama!
[01:35:29.187 --> 01:35:30.708]  Good luck undoing this stuff!
[01:35:30.708 --> 01:35:31.809]  Get in the chopper, everybody!
[01:35:31.809 --> 01:35:32.049]  Quick!
[01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:36.192]  So what do we have to look forward to from the Bush last days in the White House?
[01:35:36.192 --> 01:35:39.834]  You want one that'll kick opponents of the Patriot Act right in the teeth?
[01:35:39.834 --> 01:35:43.996]  How about law enforcement officials spying on us, all of us, everyone?
[01:35:43.996 --> 01:35:48.558]  Even if non-criminals not engaging in criminal activities are among us.
[01:35:48.558 --> 01:35:50.199]  Aunt Edna, you too.
[01:35:50.199 --> 01:36:01.985]  In July, the Justice Department proposed a regulation that would allow state and local law enforcement agencies to collect intelligence on individuals and organizations even if the information is unrelated to any criminal matter.
[01:36:02.685 --> 01:36:04.126]  Think about that for a minute.
[01:36:04.126 --> 01:36:05.626]  Sure, go ahead, collect the intelligence.
[01:36:05.626 --> 01:36:08.228]  It doesn't have to have anything to do with the criminal investigation.
[01:36:08.228 --> 01:36:12.330]  President Bush, according to the Washington Independent, is keen on the idea.
[01:36:12.330 --> 01:36:16.932]  Even if they weren't already watching you, they soon could be, really easily.
[01:36:16.932 --> 01:36:19.433]  Joining us now, my friend the sports writer Dave Zirin.
[01:36:19.433 --> 01:36:21.474]  He's sports correspondent with The Nation magazine.
[01:36:21.474 --> 01:36:24.175]  He got a little taste of this from the government earlier this year.
[01:36:24.175 --> 01:36:25.536]  Mr. Zirin, thanks for coming on.
[01:36:25.856 --> 01:36:32.945]  Great to be here, Rachel, but I gotta say, if your unpopularity is over 76%, you shouldn't be allowed to use the White House remote control at that point.
[01:36:32.945 --> 01:36:37.651]  Let alone dramatically change the justice orientation of the country?
[01:36:37.651 --> 01:36:39.733]  Hemorrhoids are more popular than this man.
[01:36:39.733 --> 01:36:40.835]  Why is he making laws?
[01:36:41.235 --> 01:36:41.896]  I'm very angry.
[01:36:41.896 --> 01:36:44.439]  Well he's doing it in a way that will make them hard to reverse.
[01:36:44.439 --> 01:36:44.899]  That's right.
[01:36:44.899 --> 01:36:49.824]  Now Dave, I wanted you to be on the show tonight because you went through an experience like this.
[01:36:49.824 --> 01:36:49.924]  Yes.
[01:36:49.924 --> 01:36:52.667]  What Bush is proposing for the whole country in Tacoma, Maryland.
[01:36:52.667 --> 01:36:53.748]  Now what did you go through?
[01:36:53.748 --> 01:36:58.173]  Well the Maryland State Police sent people to infiltrate meetings I was in.
[01:36:58.173 --> 01:37:00.516]  A very seditious organization called the Campaign
[01:37:00.896 --> 01:37:02.277]  To end the death penalty.
[01:37:02.277 --> 01:37:06.579]  Where we planned such horrifying acts like tabling at the local farmers market.
[01:37:06.579 --> 01:37:07.920]  Or planning rallies.
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:10.542]  I mean constitutionally protected activities.
[01:37:10.542 --> 01:37:14.064]  The most basic kinds of things that I think sometimes we take for granted.
[01:37:14.064 --> 01:37:20.128]  And the horrible thing was that not only did they send people in to spy on us, to take notes on what we were doing, notes on what we were saying.
[01:37:20.708 --> 01:37:27.531]  But also, according to their own documents, they would come back in even after they determined that we weren't doing anything wrong.
[01:37:27.531 --> 01:37:29.873]  They were sent back in to spy on us.
[01:37:29.873 --> 01:37:31.333]  And it turned, why were they spying on us?
[01:37:31.333 --> 01:37:40.978]  Because the governor at the time, Bob Ehrlich, a right-wing Republican who makes Sarah Palin look like Emma Goldman, I mean, he is somebody who saw us as political opponents.
[01:37:40.978 --> 01:37:42.519]  He was for the death penalty.
[01:37:42.519 --> 01:37:44.040]  We were against the death penalty.
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:46.521]  Therefore, in his mind, we deserve to be spied upon.
[01:37:46.561 --> 01:37:50.904]  And so we essentially used homeland security powers of the state government to go after you guys.
[01:37:50.904 --> 01:38:03.012]  Yeah, we were entered into a database, the heading of which was terrorists slash anti-government, and anti-war activists were entered in a database that was called terrorists slash anti-war.
[01:38:03.012 --> 01:38:14.300]  And then the person who organized all of this, the head of the Maryland State Police, a man by the name of Tim Hutchins, who was once named by your friend Keith one of the worst people in the world, Tim Hutchins, he called us fringe people.
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:15.420]  In the hearings.
[01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:17.341]  He said we deserved it because we were fringe people.
[01:38:17.341 --> 01:38:20.243]  So one of the things I want to ask is who's the real fringe person here?
[01:38:20.243 --> 01:38:25.125]  People who actually believe in the Constitution or people like Tim Hutchins who use it like Kleenex?
[01:38:25.125 --> 01:38:30.687]  Did any of the politicians, any of the people who were involved in this get in trouble for doing what they did?
[01:38:30.687 --> 01:38:31.848]  It was all exposed ultimately.
[01:38:32.008 --> 01:38:34.089]  It was all exposed, but here's the problem.
[01:38:34.089 --> 01:38:42.714]  To use a sports metaphor, the expose by former Attorney General Steve Sachs was the equivalent of driving 99 yards for a touchdown, and then taking a knee.
[01:38:42.714 --> 01:38:55.821]  I mean, the report revealed every last bit of anti-constitutional behavior by the Maryland State Police, but then all of the recommendations were looking forward, about future laws, future safeguards, and we believe people really need to be held into account for this.
[01:38:56.301 --> 01:38:57.882]  Bob Ehrlich, Tim Hutchins.
[01:38:57.882 --> 01:39:00.403]  I mean, we either have a constitution or we don't.
[01:39:00.403 --> 01:39:02.604]  Either our rights were violated or they weren't.
[01:39:02.604 --> 01:39:04.985]  And I mean, they're spying on sports writers here, Rachel.
[01:39:04.985 --> 01:39:06.766]  I mean, I ain't at EDDA here.
[01:39:06.766 --> 01:39:07.187]  You know?
[01:39:07.187 --> 01:39:09.408]  I mean, I got my politics, but this is ridiculous.
[01:39:09.408 --> 01:39:23.835]  Well, the prospect of this being expanded nationwide, essentially giving a Justice Department, federal government, green light to local and state law enforcement agencies to collect intelligence on anybody, regardless of criminal suspicion, which is what you went through,
[01:39:24.175 --> 01:39:30.399]  They're talking about expanding this nationwide, and what they will say in order to argue for it is, oh, what's the harm done to Dave Zirin?
[01:39:30.399 --> 01:39:31.339]  What's the harm done?
[01:39:31.339 --> 01:39:37.463]  Here's the harm, because I'll quote Senator Ben Cardin from Maryland, because it has a chilling effect on the Constitution.
[01:39:37.463 --> 01:39:40.105]  It has a chilling effect on our ability to assemble.
[01:39:40.105 --> 01:39:42.466]  I mean, we have to remember that we're living in a time where
[01:39:42.466 --> 01:39:42.706]  All right.
[01:40:03.929 --> 01:40:08.810]  And he joins us, and now we'll be taking your calls coming up in the next hour.
[01:40:08.810 --> 01:40:17.112]  Dave Zirin is our guest, and you can go up to InfoWars.com and link over to his website if you'd like.
[01:40:17.112 --> 01:40:21.694]  His website is EdgeofSports.com.
[01:40:21.694 --> 01:40:25.315]  Dave Zirin, it's good to have you on with us.
[01:40:25.315 --> 01:40:27.455]  Hey, great to be here, thank you.
[01:40:27.455 --> 01:40:30.556]  I was playing that news clip, and I think you really succinctly in just a few minutes
[01:40:31.438 --> 01:40:31.578]  Yeah.
[01:40:51.681 --> 01:40:56.122]  No, that's actually a point that a lot of people emailed me after I was on that show.
[01:40:56.122 --> 01:40:59.783]  It was a very interesting thing, first of all, about talking about that.
[01:40:59.783 --> 01:41:04.164]  I mean, first of all, I got a lot of support emails.
[01:41:04.164 --> 01:41:09.385]  And people who call themselves Democrats, Republicans, lefties, righties.
[01:41:09.385 --> 01:41:13.385]  I mean, because it seems to cross a line for all of us who live in this country.
[01:41:13.385 --> 01:41:19.807]  Like this idea that you just can't sit in a room and even just talk about an issue without worrying about being spied upon.
[01:41:19.807 --> 01:41:20.647]  It just seems to cross
[01:41:21.207 --> 01:41:23.589]  A pretty sacred line for a lot of people.
[01:41:23.589 --> 01:41:29.994]  Then the other thing was, yeah, just like you said, a lot of people got in touch with me and said, let's not be naive here.
[01:41:29.994 --> 01:41:33.317]  Let's not think this takes some sort of special public law.
[01:41:33.317 --> 01:41:35.799]  This stuff is happening already.
[01:41:35.799 --> 01:41:39.182]  Well, it's always been going on, you know, since the 50s.
[01:41:39.182 --> 01:41:42.845]  But, I mean, now it's against anybody.
[01:41:42.845 --> 01:41:46.308]  The left, the right, they're spying on everyone.
[01:41:46.308 --> 01:41:49.911]  And just the opposite of a free society.
[01:41:50.775 --> 01:41:54.016]  But specifically, how did you learn you were being spied on?
[01:41:54.016 --> 01:42:05.039]  That's a great question, and the randomness of how I found out and how it became public only speaks more to how just frightening all of this is.
[01:42:05.039 --> 01:42:10.421]  There is a gentleman, an anti-war activist named Max Obeshevsky in Baltimore.
[01:42:10.421 --> 01:42:15.102]  And Max had the feeling that he was being followed or tailed.
[01:42:16.227 --> 01:42:25.213]  And so what he did was he went to the ACLU and asked them to file a State Freedom of Information Act request.
[01:42:25.213 --> 01:42:33.418]  And what was produced out of 3,000 pages that they had, they gave 41 of those pages.
[01:42:33.418 --> 01:42:37.641]  And on those 41 pages, what was revealed was not just things about Max,
[01:42:38.399 --> 01:42:49.803]  But just all kinds of drippings and droppings about other surveillance that had been done, including surveillance on my little anti-death penalty group.
[01:42:49.803 --> 01:43:07.450]  And the thing about it that really caught people's eye, and that turned it into a national scandal, was that it was clear from looking at the document that the Maryland State Police continued to surveil even after they had made the internal determination
[01:43:08.106 --> 01:43:10.750]  That nothing illegal was going on.
[01:43:10.750 --> 01:43:15.035]  So it became surveillance for the sake of surveillance.
[01:43:15.035 --> 01:43:18.440]  And when you couple that with the fact that the death penalty has
[01:43:19.478 --> 01:43:25.201]  Nothing to do with any of what Homeland Security Fund is supposed to be funding.
[01:43:25.201 --> 01:43:32.724]  I mean, what does the anti-death penalty protest have to do with protecting the homeland and al-Qaeda and terrorism and all that stuff?
[01:43:32.724 --> 01:43:38.307]  I mean, it just went from the ridiculous to the offensive very quickly in people's minds.
[01:43:38.747 --> 01:43:52.057]  Well, you know, the famous case back in the 70s of the Texas State Police with 300,000 people in files, spying on every major preacher in every town, keeping notes on what everyone said, and that was found to be illegal, and they never quit.
[01:43:52.057 --> 01:43:53.738]  They just went underground.
[01:43:53.738 --> 01:43:55.559]  And of course, they're federally funded.
[01:43:55.559 --> 01:44:00.463]  The state police were actually founded by Roosevelt, and so they're really a federally chartered operation.
[01:44:00.463 --> 01:44:04.746]  Most people don't know that, but specifically, what I'm worried about is this.
[01:44:05.476 --> 01:44:13.101]  I would love to think Barack Obama is great, but he's already saying, hey, the troops are going to stay there until 2011, 2012, until we look at it.
[01:44:13.101 --> 01:44:15.883]  He's already saying, yeah, warrantless wiretapping, we're going to do it.
[01:44:15.883 --> 01:44:18.504]  He's already, you know, Hillary Clinton, old guard, it's all coming in.
[01:44:18.504 --> 01:44:19.245]  But regardless,
[01:44:20.077 --> 01:44:28.342]  I see these shows and it's like, oh, Bush is dastardly expanding this right before he leaves, so it makes it harder for Obama to reverse it.
[01:44:28.342 --> 01:44:31.204]  Obama can sign an order too and reverse it.
[01:44:31.204 --> 01:44:32.785]  The courts can come in and reverse it.
[01:44:32.785 --> 01:44:40.830]  So, I mean, I see a lot of backpedaling and a lot of establishment left, and I don't care about left and right.
[01:44:40.830 --> 01:44:42.472]  I just don't want secret police spying on me.
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:52.985]  I think I'll give some credit to Matthews on MSNBC, because he did a segment yesterday about a lot of this.
[01:44:52.985 --> 01:44:57.567]  And then the segment was called, Brother, Can You Spare Some Change?
[01:44:57.567 --> 01:45:06.392]  And I thought it was a good statement to ask Obama, because, hey, you can't run on change and then come to us with more of the same.
[01:45:06.392 --> 01:45:08.253]  I mean, we can't accept that.
[01:45:08.253 --> 01:45:09.174]  We can't accept
[01:45:09.762 --> 01:45:15.724]  Real debate in this country can only happen in a couple of months before a presidential election.
[01:45:15.724 --> 01:45:18.665]  And I'll tell you what, a lot of people are going to be keeping their eye on.
[01:45:18.665 --> 01:45:27.849]  I mean, one of the great criticisms of Bush and Cheney was the expansion of the executive, the expansion of the power of the executive branch.
[01:45:27.849 --> 01:45:32.050]  Will Obama roll that back when he comes in office?
[01:45:32.050 --> 01:45:35.432]  I think most people will say, no he won't.
[01:45:35.432 --> 01:45:38.853]  But I think there's the expectation that he should.
[01:45:39.861 --> 01:45:40.402]  Well, I mean, how-
[01:45:51.906 --> 01:45:59.010]  Stayed at home those midterm elections, because they were so disgusted by the broken promises of Clinton those first two years.
[01:45:59.010 --> 01:46:03.992]  All kinds of lip service, and then nothing to show for it those first couple years.
[01:46:03.992 --> 01:46:05.933]  And I think Obama better be very careful.
[01:46:05.933 --> 01:46:11.356]  I mean, he can't draw the lesson that Clinton was too left-wing his first two years in office.
[01:46:11.356 --> 01:46:14.778]  Clinton got nothing done his first two years in office.
[01:46:14.778 --> 01:46:17.559]  And then the people, especially young people, stayed home.
[01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:27.546]  And so we'll see if Obama learns that lesson from history, but given the fact that he has all these Clintonians around him, it does make you wonder.
[01:46:27.546 --> 01:46:34.550]  Well, I mean, you write for The Nation and some other big publications that would be called progressive or, you know, kind of... Yeah, right, right, right, about sports.
[01:46:35.319 --> 01:46:40.784]  Well, I mean, I understand that, but I mean, you're around those people and you go on TV and talk about issues.
[01:46:40.784 --> 01:46:44.447]  What are people kind of in the establishment left that you bump elbows with?
[01:46:44.447 --> 01:46:48.190]  Are they starting to get a little concerned about Obama?
[01:46:49.342 --> 01:47:06.747]  I think at this point, and one of the good things about being a sports writer in these publications and writing about where sports and politics collide, one of the disadvantages is maybe in the absolute center and get to hear all the scuttlebutt, but one of the advantages is I get to at least see a lot of the forest for the trees.
[01:47:06.747 --> 01:47:13.528]  And I would say at this point they still have the Obama Kool-Aid hooked up via IV into their arms.
[01:47:13.528 --> 01:47:15.869]  And it's going to take a minute.
[01:47:16.542 --> 01:47:19.764]  Before any sort of honeymoon is over on this front.
[01:47:19.764 --> 01:47:32.172]  I mean, they're gonna... I mean, right now, I just was talking to a bunch of them the other day, and they're all of a sudden saying, well, Hillary Clinton, you know, she could be a fine Secretary of State, a hard worker, very intelligent.
[01:47:32.172 --> 01:47:37.275]  And I said, well, weren't you the same person arguing that we had to turn the page on McClinton?
[01:47:37.275 --> 01:47:39.536]  I was just turning the page on McClinton.
[01:47:39.536 --> 01:47:41.237]  And they're like, well, you gotta give him a chance.
[01:47:41.237 --> 01:47:42.898]  You're being a naysayer already.
[01:47:42.898 --> 01:47:45.380]  You know, he hasn't even been inaugurated yet.
[01:47:46.181 --> 01:47:48.564]  But, you know, past his prologue, as they say.
[01:47:48.564 --> 01:47:53.531]  I mean, he is laying the groundwork right now, and I'll tell you something, there's something bizarre.
[01:47:54.913 --> 01:47:56.574]  About our side.
[01:47:56.574 --> 01:47:58.135]  You know, people who want to see change.
[01:47:58.135 --> 01:48:01.017]  And I'm not saying right-wing, left-wing, but people who want to see change.
[01:48:01.017 --> 01:48:02.658]  People who want to see the end of torture.
[01:48:02.658 --> 01:48:06.901]  People who want to see the end of corporate crime and skullduggery.
[01:48:06.901 --> 01:48:10.303]  That we're somehow going to be silent and give them a chance.
[01:48:10.303 --> 01:48:20.230]  Meanwhile, all of these other forces, the old Clintonites, what have you, the National Security State, do you think they're keeping their mouth shut and saying, let's give them a chance?
[01:48:20.230 --> 01:48:23.232]  No, they're trying to have influence right now as we speak.
[01:48:26.054 --> 01:48:28.717]  Well, that's exactly what I was about to ask you.
[01:48:28.717 --> 01:48:32.260]  People need to put pressure on him now and then there might be some change.
[01:48:32.260 --> 01:48:39.967]  But if people signal, oh, we're just in love with you and have lovey-dovey eyes and are swooning, they're gonna go crazy.
[01:48:39.967 --> 01:48:45.072]  So let's talk about that when we get back with our guest, one of the biggest sports writers out there.
[01:48:46.826 --> 01:48:50.668]  Do you take nutritional supplements but don't notice any benefits?
[01:48:50.668 --> 01:48:58.132]  The problem is today's supplements contain things like DL-alpha-tocopherol, a synthetic form of vitamin E derived from petroleum.
[01:48:58.132 --> 01:49:02.755]  Or ferrous fumarate, an inorganic form of iron that can actually damage your body.
[01:49:02.755 --> 01:49:07.438]  Most of today's vitamin and mineral supplements are actually stressing your liver and kidneys.
[01:49:07.438 --> 01:49:11.720]  Find out what nutritionist Stephen Hewer has learned from 30 years of extensive research.
[01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:12.581]  We're good to go.

[01:49:46.826 --> 01:49:50.027]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:49:50.027 --> 01:49:52.268]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:49:52.268 --> 01:49:53.648]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:49:53.648 --> 01:49:55.189]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:49:55.189 --> 01:49:56.889]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:49:56.889 --> 01:49:59.810]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:49:59.810 --> 01:50:03.412]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:50:12.638 --> 01:50:17.423]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:50:17.423 --> 01:50:19.985]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:50:37.541 --> 01:50:38.622]  Truth Rising.

[01:50:43.706 --> 01:50:46.748]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:50:46.748 --> 01:50:56.036]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[01:50:56.036 --> 01:51:04.002]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[01:51:04.162 --> 01:51:08.765]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[01:51:08.765 --> 01:51:11.527]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[01:51:11.527 --> 01:51:20.372]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol, naturally and safely, by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as
[01:51:20.732 --> 01:51:21.233]  I think so.
[01:51:56.067 --> 01:51:59.150]  Everybody knows that the day is unloaded.
[01:51:59.150 --> 01:52:03.894]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[01:52:03.894 --> 01:52:07.617]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[01:52:07.617 --> 01:52:11.901]  Everybody knows the good guy's lost.
[01:52:14.704 --> 01:52:16.045]  David Zirin is our guest.
[01:52:16.045 --> 01:52:19.629]  He'll be with us about 15 minutes of the next hour, so the next 20 minutes or so.
[01:52:19.629 --> 01:52:23.633]  Then we're going to have open phones for the rest of the next hour on Cover News.
[01:52:23.633 --> 01:52:28.638]  We have David Ray Griffin and Stephen Jones joining us, coming up in the hour after that.
[01:52:29.458 --> 01:52:36.821]  Our guest is a sports writer who also crosses over to covering the emergence of sports becoming more political.
[01:52:36.821 --> 01:52:40.183]  Kind of like the Hollywood folks have been so political for 50, 60 years.
[01:52:40.183 --> 01:52:47.126]  Well just now we're seeing, I guess kind of like a Charles Barkley going back a decade ago, the rise of sports people.
[01:52:48.570 --> 01:52:53.972]  Uh, who he was saying during the break, he believes are getting more cultural currency than Hollywood folks into politics.
[01:52:53.972 --> 01:52:56.193]  So we'll talk about that before he leaves us.
[01:52:56.193 --> 01:53:11.438]  Uh, but finishing up with being spied on, uh, after you learned you'd been spied on, had, uh, were they still following you around or going to your meetings or, you know, watching the evil sports writer, uh, or, uh, you know, by then, uh, have the investigation on you ended?
[01:53:12.679 --> 01:53:19.162]  Well, according to the reports, and once again we're just going by the reports here, the investigation itself had ended.
[01:53:19.162 --> 01:53:36.788]  And since all this took place, you know, more Freedom of Information Act requests have come through, more information has revealed itself, and it turns out they were spying on everybody from anti-war groups to the Chesapeake Climate Control Committee.
[01:53:36.788 --> 01:53:41.230]  And so you look at the whole broad swath of who they were spying on, and it's pretty much
[01:53:41.946 --> 01:53:50.292]  Anybody that was trying to have any sort of community or civic interaction with the government was spied upon.
[01:53:50.292 --> 01:53:52.414]  And to me, it's evidence of a lot of things.
[01:53:52.414 --> 01:54:00.720]  It's evidence that the previous governor here, Bob Ehrlich, was as paranoid as Nixon in terms of his own political stability.
[01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:05.143]  But it also says something really interesting to me about Homeland Security dollars.
[01:54:05.143 --> 01:54:08.386]  I mean, we're living in a time, obviously, of serious financial crisis.
[01:54:09.019 --> 01:54:19.449]  And how much state money, how much of this federal money is going to states if they have the kind of money to dither away on surveilling the Chesapeake Climate Control Committee?
[01:54:19.449 --> 01:54:25.515]  I mean, what does that say about the priorities where our tax dollars are going?
[01:54:25.515 --> 01:54:29.018]  Well, I myself, as a talk show host, have been surveilled.
[01:54:29.018 --> 01:54:30.119]  And it's really ham-fisted.
[01:54:30.119 --> 01:54:33.182]  I mean, this goes back a decade ago, where you'd be at some event
[01:54:34.145 --> 01:54:41.072]  And, uh, some mainline political deal and somebody walk over and go, we need to shoot these politicians, we ought to bomb them.
[01:54:41.072 --> 01:54:44.916]  And then you follow the person out of the parking lot and it'd be an unmarked police car.
[01:54:44.916 --> 01:54:47.539]  I mean, it's just so ham-fisted the way they try to provocateur.
[01:54:48.388 --> 01:54:50.109]  Yeah, no, that's right, that's right.
[01:54:50.109 --> 01:55:06.153]  And it does create its own paranoia as well, because I was in a meeting where we were talking about this, and one person said, we have to watch out for that very thing, the people who come in and they raise all these provocative ideas about violence and whatnot.
[01:55:06.153 --> 01:55:13.395]  And then someone else said, yeah, but we also have to watch out for people who are very conservative and don't want us to do anything, because that's also how they operate.
[01:55:13.975 --> 01:55:15.836]  Then I said, wait a minute.
[01:55:15.836 --> 01:55:16.396]  So what?
[01:55:16.396 --> 01:55:20.218]  Do we have to watch out for people who are too wild and then people who aren't wild?
[01:55:20.218 --> 01:55:21.538]  Who's left?
[01:55:21.538 --> 01:55:27.741]  I mean, you get to this point where anybody who you don't know then becomes a suspect.
[01:55:27.741 --> 01:55:34.824]  And that has an absolutely chilling, if not crippling effect on people's ability to just be civically engaged.
[01:55:34.824 --> 01:55:40.106]  Well, that's why you just have to obey the laws, do the right thing, speak up, and not cower and hide.
[01:55:40.106 --> 01:55:41.987]  I mean, back during the 90s with militia groups,
[01:55:43.097 --> 01:55:48.822]  They would immediately get into these paranoid mindsets and start hiding out, thinking everybody was after them.
[01:55:48.822 --> 01:55:54.086]  And that was perfect for the Feds to come in and actually try to get them to be violent so they could get more funding.
[01:55:54.086 --> 01:55:57.648]  I mean, it's the same thing on the left or the right.
[01:55:57.648 --> 01:56:04.113]  All of this paranoia hiding underneath the desk really feeds into what the Feds want.
[01:56:04.113 --> 01:56:05.054]  And it's just despicable.
[01:56:05.054 --> 01:56:08.216]  I don't know how they find people that are willing to do this.
[01:56:08.216 --> 01:56:11.819]  So you guys in your meetings, though, never had anybody try to provocateur that you know of?
[01:56:13.249 --> 01:56:14.310]  Uh, back in the day.
[01:56:14.310 --> 01:56:19.213]  I mean, if you're talking about in the last several years since, uh, no.
[01:56:19.213 --> 01:56:19.993]  Oh, but you did have them.
[01:56:19.993 --> 01:56:21.094]  Not in the last several years.
[01:56:21.094 --> 01:56:21.694]  But you did before.
[01:56:21.694 --> 01:56:22.715]  But back in the day.
[01:56:22.715 --> 01:56:23.715]  Well, we'll stay there.
[01:56:23.715 --> 01:56:24.336]  Stay there.
[01:56:24.336 --> 01:56:28.418]  Back in 60 seconds.
[01:56:28.418 --> 01:56:31.040]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:34.182]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:56:37.065 --> 01:56:43.827]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:56:43.827 --> 01:56:46.448]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:56:46.448 --> 01:56:48.008]  But who is the enemy?
[01:56:48.008 --> 01:56:48.809]  Bin Laden.
[01:56:48.809 --> 01:56:49.669]  This is his ammo.
[01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:51.169]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:56:51.169 --> 01:56:52.790]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:56:53.150 --> 01:57:00.320]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:00.801]  Some U.S.
[01:57:00.801 --> 01:57:07.169]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:57:07.169 --> 01:57:10.614]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:57:10.834 --> 01:57:21.116]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:57:21.116 --> 01:57:22.356]  Fabled enemies.

[01:57:30.098 --> 01:57:33.499]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:57:39.349 --> 01:57:41.751]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:57:41.751 --> 01:57:51.137]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:51.137 --> 01:57:52.437]  Big Brother.
[01:57:52.437 --> 01:57:54.218]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:54.218 --> 01:57:55.960]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.960 --> 01:57:57.541]  You want answers?
[01:57:57.541 --> 01:57:59.102]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:59.102 --> 01:58:03.304]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:03.304 --> 01:58:07.387]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:11.015 --> 01:58:12.116]  Well, he's a sports writer.
[01:58:12.116 --> 01:58:17.660]  That's for a lot of big publications, including The Nation.
[01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:18.401]  David Zirin.
[01:58:18.401 --> 01:58:20.202]  His website is edgeofsports.com.
[01:58:20.202 --> 01:58:24.106]  Got links to it up on infowars.com.
[01:58:24.106 --> 01:58:26.187]  And they have a little in-the-death-penalty group.
[01:58:26.187 --> 01:58:30.351]  And, by the way, whether you agree with that or disagree with it, totally peaceful group.
[01:58:30.351 --> 01:58:33.873]  Historically, you don't hear of death-penalty groups of hurting anybody.
[01:58:33.873 --> 01:58:36.896]  I mean, being spied on by the state police with federal funds.
[01:58:37.851 --> 01:58:41.792]  And incidentally, I am for the death penalty as a moral thing.
[01:58:41.792 --> 01:58:46.633]  I mean, if you catch somebody red-handed killing somebody premeditatively, I think they should die.
[01:58:46.633 --> 01:59:04.876]  But I'm against the death penalty because we found over a third of those on death row end up are completely innocent and the system is so... I mean, when the Houston Crime Lab alone in one year framed 4,000 people and some of them went to death row in Texas, there's a problem here.
[01:59:04.876 --> 01:59:07.157]  But regardless, regardless,
[01:59:07.853 --> 01:59:10.034]  Well, I'll say two things.
[01:59:10.034 --> 01:59:13.775]  First of all, on the question you just said, I'm in agreement with you about that.
[01:59:13.775 --> 01:59:15.076]  I mean, I'm not a morally
[01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:32.361]  I'm not one of those people who's morally against the death penalty.
[01:59:32.361 --> 01:59:42.268]  I just think the system itself is so riddled with errors and problems and biases that it just does not operate effectively in a democratic society.
[01:59:42.268 --> 01:59:49.052]  On the second point, no, the people who we know absolutely positively who are plants were spies.
[01:59:49.986 --> 01:59:51.987]  Well, actually, this is remarkable.
[01:59:51.987 --> 02:00:05.634]  Like, a young woman who just was like this kind-faced person who just asked a lot of very good questions and took copious notes and made sure she was on all the email lists.
[02:00:05.634 --> 02:00:09.336]  I mean, I have been almost a forgettable person.
[02:00:09.336 --> 02:00:12.477]  I mean, fortunately, I never erased any emails.
[02:00:12.477 --> 02:00:17.900]  And I went back and looked at all the several dozen emails she'd sent me over her time in the group.
[02:00:18.687 --> 02:00:20.789]  And they're so benign.
[02:00:20.789 --> 02:00:26.493]  And that's part of, I guess, what makes an effective long-term plan.
[02:00:26.493 --> 02:00:36.079]  But it's also benign, we have to remember, because her own conclusions, according to the declassified documents, was that we weren't doing anything wrong.
[02:00:36.079 --> 02:00:45.406]  And so, and the scandal, like I said, and I can't repeat this enough, is that she was sent back in after reporting that nothing illegal was going on.
[02:00:51.331 --> 02:00:53.432]  I was just thinking about that.
[02:00:53.432 --> 02:01:04.836]  The case with Michael Moore, where he shows the peace group, the anti-war group that bake cookies every week, and then they learn the guy was a police informant because he died in a car wreck.
[02:01:04.836 --> 02:01:13.679]  Any gauge on how many spies just through that state police program in Maryland there are?
[02:01:13.679 --> 02:01:18.101]  We know from the documents that they devoted hundreds of man and woman hours
[02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:26.622]  Two spying on groups, and you could do a lot of damage in that time if you think that a typical group at most meets for an hour or two a week.
[02:01:26.622 --> 02:01:29.803]  And you think about hundreds of hours that we know about.
[02:01:29.803 --> 02:01:36.685]  I mean, then you're talking about them really covering a lot of ground, and a lot of money going into this as well.
[02:01:36.685 --> 02:01:46.168]  And then the fact that... I mean, I know you played a clip of this off the Rachel Maddow Show, but the fact that they entered us into these anti-terror databases,
[02:01:47.063 --> 02:01:57.190]  And lumped us in within these databases that are incredibly harmful, and who knows what kind of access that gives to our personal lives if you happen to be one of those people.
[02:01:57.190 --> 02:01:59.972]  Hey, my dad was driving one of my cars.
[02:01:59.972 --> 02:02:03.094]  I sold it to him and he hadn't changed the registration over.
[02:02:03.094 --> 02:02:11.060]  And the cop pulled him over in the middle of nowhere in Texas one night, like 10 o'clock at night, and said, and said, wait right there for like 10 minutes, then came up and said, well, you're not Alex Jones.
[02:02:11.938 --> 02:02:20.509]  And he said, he said, yeah, but he said, yeah, you've got a handle with care note in my computer system.
[02:02:20.509 --> 02:02:23.212]  You know, you're on a watch list.
[02:02:23.212 --> 02:02:28.439]  So now the police departments are dialing in to these private databases as well.
[02:02:28.439 --> 02:02:29.100]  Were you aware of that?
[02:02:30.384 --> 02:02:31.465]  No, I was not.
[02:02:31.465 --> 02:02:33.989]  It's good to know.
[02:02:33.989 --> 02:02:41.859]  Well, once that happened to my dad about six months ago, I looked into it and found out that, yeah, they've got all sorts of databases and a lot of the stuff in them is wrong.
[02:02:41.859 --> 02:02:46.325]  Final segment with our guest, we'll talk about the influence of sports in politics when we get back.
[02:02:47.130 --> 02:02:48.811]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:02:48.811 --> 02:02:53.554]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:02:53.554 --> 02:02:56.516]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:02:56.516 --> 02:02:59.558]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:02:59.558 --> 02:03:05.701]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:03:05.701 --> 02:03:11.265]  Our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for the special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it.
[02:03:11.485 --> 02:03:13.327]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[02:03:13.327 --> 02:03:17.290]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[02:03:17.290 --> 02:03:20.112]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[02:03:20.112 --> 02:03:29.259]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food, beyond many Americans' reach.
[02:03:29.259 --> 02:03:36.345]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[02:03:36.345 --> 02:03:38.347]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast,
[02:03:38.567 --> 02:03:40.769]  There seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[02:03:40.769 --> 02:03:46.474]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[02:03:46.474 --> 02:03:49.717]  The stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business.
[02:03:49.717 --> 02:03:53.080]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:54.901]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[02:03:54.901 --> 02:03:58.605]  One third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[02:03:58.965 --> 02:04:03.088]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[02:04:03.088 --> 02:04:10.635]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[02:04:10.635 --> 02:04:14.578]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[02:04:14.578 --> 02:04:17.801]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:04:17.801 --> 02:04:24.806]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:04:24.806 --> 02:04:27.889]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:04:28.049 --> 02:04:33.214]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com.

[02:04:45.225 --> 02:04:47.047]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:04:55.089 --> 02:04:57.850]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:04:57.850 --> 02:05:05.573]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:05.573 --> 02:05:08.635]  Open phones in the shower at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:05:08.635 --> 02:05:12.436]  After our guest leaves us here in about 7-8 minutes.
[02:05:12.436 --> 02:05:16.418]  Got a lot of other news I haven't gotten to yet.
[02:05:16.418 --> 02:05:20.499]  Some interesting developments on the health front.
[02:05:20.499 --> 02:05:21.560]  They have now implanted
[02:05:22.944 --> 02:05:25.425]  There's a big race to do this in the last month.
[02:05:25.425 --> 02:05:30.048]  Several artificially grown organs in the human body.
[02:05:30.048 --> 02:05:32.729]  Grown from your own tissue.
[02:05:32.729 --> 02:05:37.432]  No need to even use aborted baby parts to do it.
[02:05:37.432 --> 02:05:39.833]  So that is coming up as well.
[02:05:39.833 --> 02:05:42.615]  I have some interesting news clips I want to play and comment on too.
[02:05:43.471 --> 02:05:50.334]  But we're talking to national sports writer, writes for The Nation and other publications, Dave Zirin.
[02:05:50.334 --> 02:05:53.495]  His website is edgeofsports.com.
[02:05:53.495 --> 02:05:58.057]  My website is, of course, infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:05:58.057 --> 02:06:11.503]  Dave, shifting gears in the time we have left, what you're really reporting on now is the expansion of, I mean, the exponential growth of sports icons and sports
[02:06:13.124 --> 02:06:18.687]  We're getting finally finished with the whole era that I like to think of as the era of Michael Jordan.
[02:06:18.687 --> 02:06:22.288]  And that's not a reference to the great basketball players' skills on the courts.
[02:06:42.307 --> 02:06:50.600]  But this famous statement about why he wouldn't stand up to North Carolina Senator Jesse Elms because he said Republicans buy sneakers too.
[02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:56.490]  I mean, it was a statement of apolitical principle, if there is such a thing.
[02:06:57.230 --> 02:07:02.634]  And this idea that making money is king, and everything else comes in second.
[02:07:02.634 --> 02:07:07.457]  And so that has dominated a sports world which is such a huge globalized business.
[02:07:07.457 --> 02:07:15.822]  By the way, I mean, I think that's a very cowardly... I'm not attacking Michael Jordan, but that really is a self-centered, mindless comment, and the guy's not stupid, obviously.
[02:07:15.822 --> 02:07:20.285]  I mean, thinking he's in a bubble and nothing affects him, but go ahead.
[02:07:20.285 --> 02:07:26.629]  No, that's exactly the point, is that it's a statement of saying, in a very proud way,
[02:07:27.492 --> 02:07:33.776]  I could care less about anything that happens in the world, I only care about selling my sneakers.
[02:07:33.776 --> 02:07:43.661]  And it really did fit in with this huge trillion dollar globalized sports industry, this athletic industrial complex, which has become so massive.
[02:07:43.661 --> 02:07:50.585]  Now, while that philosophy dominated a generation, you also had a lot of those lesser or middling players.
[02:07:51.385 --> 02:07:56.128]  Who are just frightened, you know, who came from poor or working-class backgrounds.
[02:07:56.128 --> 02:08:03.834]  They know that the shelf life for a bench player or a role player is only a couple of seasons, and you just want to make as much money as you can.
[02:08:03.834 --> 02:08:12.180]  And to speak out about politics and risk that, it just seemed foolhardy for a lot of players, for a generation of players, to actually risk it.
[02:08:12.180 --> 02:08:16.723]  But what you're starting to see right now is a bunch of players taking a different approach and saying,
[02:08:17.566 --> 02:08:18.467]  Wow.
[02:08:18.467 --> 02:08:20.429]  I have this remarkable platform.
[02:08:20.429 --> 02:08:22.291]  I have all of this cultural capital.
[02:08:22.291 --> 02:08:26.815]  If I say something, it might actually make some news.
[02:08:26.815 --> 02:08:30.039]  Why don't I try to use it to try to do some good?
[02:08:30.039 --> 02:08:32.001]  And that, to me, is a welcome thing.
[02:08:32.001 --> 02:08:33.642]  And a lot of people say, well, who cares?
[02:08:33.642 --> 02:08:36.365]  Athletes, why should I care what they say?
[02:08:36.365 --> 02:08:36.906]  This is why.
[02:08:37.617 --> 02:08:40.399]  Because jocks are role models.
[02:08:40.399 --> 02:08:45.302]  Whether we think that's a good thing or not, that's a question of opinion.
[02:08:45.302 --> 02:08:49.365]  It's like a warrior art type.
[02:08:49.365 --> 02:08:50.146]  Exactly.
[02:08:50.146 --> 02:08:52.007]  It's a fact that these guys are role models.
[02:08:52.712 --> 02:08:55.773]  And in my early twenties, I was a school teacher in third grade.
[02:08:55.773 --> 02:08:58.713]  I can tell you, it's deep that these guys are role models.
[02:08:58.713 --> 02:09:01.754]  Well, just interject something because you're so on target here.
[02:09:01.754 --> 02:09:02.654]  It's a cop-out.
[02:09:02.654 --> 02:09:09.995]  I mean, when we have Hollywood people sometimes on this show, our detractors will say, well, who cares what they have to say?
[02:09:09.995 --> 02:09:14.276]  Well, then why do advertisers hire them?
[02:09:14.276 --> 02:09:17.697]  Why do government officials love to get stars on board?
[02:09:17.697 --> 02:09:18.297]  The truth is,
[02:09:19.097 --> 02:09:24.180]  When somebody doesn't like what a star is saying, they play that card of so what, what they have to say.
[02:09:24.180 --> 02:09:29.443]  But bottom line, in this culture, that type of stuff is king.
[02:09:29.443 --> 02:09:32.144]  So that's a total cop-out, but go ahead.
[02:09:32.144 --> 02:09:33.285]  No, I agree, I agree.
[02:09:33.285 --> 02:09:47.953]  But here's the thing, if they're going to be role models, and if we all agree also just factually, one child born in a generation is going to be able to hit a 90 mile an hour fastball for a 350 average over a 20 year major league career.
[02:09:48.673 --> 02:09:54.319]  In other words, the odds of becoming a star yourself as a young child are infinitesimal.
[02:09:54.319 --> 02:09:56.841]  Then you have to ask yourself, well, what else are they modeling?
[02:09:56.841 --> 02:10:08.492]  I mean, if they're modeling that Jordan ethos that says, well, life is about making money and the hell with your fellow man, that's an actual modeling that people will take advantage of.
[02:10:08.492 --> 02:10:09.072]  Exactly!
[02:10:09.072 --> 02:10:10.553]  Not speaking out.
[02:10:10.553 --> 02:10:11.755]  That's a great thought.
[02:10:11.755 --> 02:10:14.237]  Not speaking out is a form of communication right there.
[02:10:15.046 --> 02:10:16.307]  It is, and it's modeling.
[02:10:16.307 --> 02:10:17.667]  This is all about role modeling.
[02:10:17.667 --> 02:10:31.652]  So when these young kids say it's a chubby short kid who doesn't have a dream in the world of dunking a basketball, and he's putting it into his stock, his role model, LeBron James, and what he's getting from LeBron James is, you know what?
[02:10:31.652 --> 02:10:33.653]  It matters to think about politics.
[02:10:33.653 --> 02:10:35.574]  It matters to care about an election.
[02:10:35.574 --> 02:10:38.775]  It matters to hold leaders accountable for what they say.
[02:10:39.415 --> 02:10:45.366]  That's a very different kind of lesson than, hey, if you can dunk a basketball and beat six foot eight, life is good.
[02:10:47.262 --> 02:10:48.403]  Wow, absolutely.
[02:10:48.403 --> 02:10:53.087]  And then, that's the exact type of message, though, that corporate America doesn't want.
[02:10:53.087 --> 02:11:00.874]  They want the basketball and football and baseball stars to say, only care about bling, only care about money, don't believe politically involved.
[02:11:00.874 --> 02:11:12.504]  But when the heroes start telling the kids, hey be real heroes, be involved politically, be involved in things that matter, be involved in your community, that could actually bring back a viable culture.
[02:11:12.504 --> 02:11:13.605]  Oh no, we can't have that!
[02:11:14.474 --> 02:11:20.038]  And that's another interesting thing about athletes, because, you know, Joe DiMaggio said this 60 years ago.
[02:11:20.038 --> 02:11:27.064]  He said, uh, he said, rich boys don't become star pro athletes because you've got to have a hunger in your belly to make it.
[02:11:27.064 --> 02:11:36.631]  I mean, it's a bit of a broad generalization, but it is true that even though a lot of these athletes, they've got tons of money, they might live in a gated community, but it's about where they come from.
[02:11:37.251 --> 02:11:46.434]  And so there's a point of relation and a point of connection with regular folk that I think the typical Hollywood celebrity just does not have.
[02:11:46.434 --> 02:11:47.334]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:11:47.334 --> 02:11:52.116]  The nouveau riche especially, they just don't have a fire in the belly.
[02:11:52.116 --> 02:11:58.118]  They're into leisurely playing golf and screwing around and managing their companies.
[02:11:58.118 --> 02:12:03.520]  They don't have that fire in the belly that somebody who could become a sports champion generally does.
[02:12:04.548 --> 02:12:09.391]  And when you know it's whether or not your family gets out of a terrible situation.
[02:12:09.391 --> 02:12:20.259]  I mean, I can tell you, you go down to Brooklyn at, you know, two o'clock in the morning down at Coney Island, you'll see people dribbling basketballs with two hands up and down the court.
[02:12:20.259 --> 02:12:24.602]  Maybe with a brick tied around each ankle to strengthen those muscles.
[02:12:24.602 --> 02:12:31.947]  I mean, it is a monastic, sacrificial life that most of them still don't make it anyway.
[02:12:31.947 --> 02:12:33.008]  Same thing with boxing.
[02:12:34.409 --> 02:12:35.669]  Definitely.
[02:12:35.669 --> 02:12:36.209]  Definitely.
[02:12:36.209 --> 02:12:46.112]  I mean, boxing is one of the ultimate warrior sports, and the sacrifice for becoming a boxer is profound, because these young people aren't stupid.
[02:12:46.112 --> 02:12:57.095]  They watch HBO Real Sports, they see the documentaries, and they know that when they hit their 40s, after a boxing career, they might not be speaking in sentences that their own mother could understand.
[02:12:57.972 --> 02:13:05.857]  But it's a sacrifice that they try to make to try to get out of a certain financial or economic climate.
[02:13:05.857 --> 02:13:10.820]  But that's also why athletes have a real sway with young people, with poor kids.
[02:13:10.820 --> 02:13:19.225]  Because they're like, look, I've been there, and I'm telling you, you're not going to be in the NBA, but you could be a thinking person.
[02:13:21.725 --> 02:13:30.554]  Well, I mean, I think it's important for these stars to explain that they're not only valuable because they are a sports star, but that there are other things that are, frankly, even more important.
[02:13:30.554 --> 02:13:33.397]  And I think that message from them has been lacking.
[02:13:33.397 --> 02:13:40.724]  The gang member activity, the arrogance, the corruption that certainly the media magnifies and, you know, loves only focusing on that.
[02:13:40.724 --> 02:13:42.166]  But that's had a detrimental effect
[02:13:42.566 --> 02:13:42.847]  That is true.
[02:13:57.820 --> 02:14:03.281]  Dave Zirin, just an amazing individual, EdgeofSports.com.
[02:14:03.281 --> 02:14:06.042]  In closing, a few minutes on Pat Tillman.
[02:14:06.042 --> 02:14:11.823]  I mean, that whole thing of him getting sucked in, you know, that same, you know, hero, warrior attitude.
[02:14:11.823 --> 02:14:13.463]  He wants to go fight for his country.
[02:14:13.463 --> 02:14:15.704]  He finds out Afghanistan's a photo-op.
[02:14:15.704 --> 02:14:17.224]  I've talked to his brother.
[02:14:17.224 --> 02:14:18.825]  He finds out it's a scam.
[02:14:18.825 --> 02:14:20.965]  He dies mysteriously.
[02:14:20.965 --> 02:14:22.545]  They cover it up.
[02:14:22.545 --> 02:14:23.566]  You've written a lot about that.
[02:14:23.566 --> 02:14:24.846]  Give us your take on Pat Tillman.
[02:14:25.968 --> 02:14:28.789]  Oh, and I spoke with his mother recently as well.
[02:14:28.789 --> 02:14:33.850]  I mean, the Pat Tillman story is both an American tragedy and an American crime.
[02:14:33.850 --> 02:14:36.931]  And we've still yet to see people truly held accountable for it.
[02:14:36.931 --> 02:14:44.814]  I think one member of the brass, a senior officer, got knocked down a peg at, like, a star taken off or something like that.
[02:14:44.814 --> 02:14:46.834]  But not the real kind of accountability that we need.
[02:14:46.834 --> 02:14:54.957]  I mean, Pat Tillman thought he was going to risk his life and die if necessary for his country and for freedom, and instead he died for public relations.
[02:14:55.678 --> 02:14:58.219]  And that in and of itself is a sin.
[02:14:58.219 --> 02:15:21.111]  And the family has the right to know what happened to him, the right to know all the facts, the right to know why his journal was destroyed after he died, the right to know why his personal effects were burned on site, and often more than anything else, the right to know why their son was exploited in the ruthless manner that he was, in death, in a way that in life, I would argue, Pat Tillman absolutely would have rejected.
[02:15:22.483 --> 02:15:24.084]  You know, you offered to go to the bottom of the hour.
[02:15:24.084 --> 02:15:24.964]  This is too important.
[02:15:24.964 --> 02:15:26.505]  Can you do that still?
[02:15:26.505 --> 02:15:27.045]  Sure.
[02:15:27.045 --> 02:15:32.808]  Okay, let's, because we've got a break, come back with a quick segment, but get started now because you've been really close to this case.
[02:15:32.808 --> 02:15:37.770]  As close as we can, you know, get to the truth, what really happened with Tillman?
[02:15:37.770 --> 02:15:39.391]  Let's do it.
[02:15:39.391 --> 02:15:40.211]  We've got about a minute now.
[02:15:40.211 --> 02:15:41.432]  Go ahead and get started.
[02:15:41.432 --> 02:15:43.773]  Oh, okay, just started now.
[02:15:43.773 --> 02:15:51.216]  Well, one of the things about the case that still just makes me very concerned is the report
[02:15:51.980 --> 02:15:56.384]  Upon his death, I mean, there's talks of friendly fire, of chaos.
[02:15:56.384 --> 02:16:08.416]  The Washington Post did a painstaking recreation of that last battle, where half of his battalion goes out, circles all the way around, and then confuses the battalion that remained, and they go after each other.
[02:16:08.416 --> 02:16:17.084]  And yet, once the autopsy results were revealed, months and months after the fact, he was killed at shots in the forehead at very close range.
[02:16:18.178 --> 02:16:21.721]  And it's just, it's hard to square those two stories together.
[02:16:21.721 --> 02:16:31.447]  I mean, on the original death, one of the troops even said that his last words were, this can't be effing happening to me, I'm effing Pat Tillman.
[02:16:31.447 --> 02:16:35.330]  Which sounded like something out of a movie when I read it at the time.
[02:16:35.330 --> 02:16:39.393]  But, and it turns out, there's no way he would have said that if he'd been shot in the forehead.
[02:16:39.393 --> 02:16:40.994]  That's not, that's not what happened.
[02:16:42.043 --> 02:16:45.289]  Yeah, it was a way to degrade him and put him down.
[02:16:45.289 --> 02:16:50.037]  We'll talk about was he murdered because he was writing letters home and going to come home against the war?
[02:16:50.037 --> 02:16:51.339]  Did they black off him?
[02:16:51.339 --> 02:16:53.463]  We'll talk to the man who's talking to the family when we get back.
[02:16:54.935 --> 02:16:58.916]  Drinking a chlorophyll-rich beverage has been found to benefit your entire body.

[02:17:54.145 --> 02:17:58.088]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[02:17:58.088 --> 02:18:01.570]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:18:01.570 --> 02:18:03.191]  The enemy struck America on September 11.
[02:18:04.191 --> 02:18:05.752]  But who is the enemy?
[02:18:05.752 --> 02:18:06.532]  Bin Laden.
[02:18:06.532 --> 02:18:07.633]  This is his MO.
[02:18:07.633 --> 02:18:08.913]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:18:08.913 --> 02:18:10.894]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:18:10.894 --> 02:18:18.057]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:18:18.057 --> 02:18:18.537]  Some U.S.
[02:18:18.537 --> 02:18:24.880]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:28.341]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:18:28.641 --> 02:18:38.863]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:18:38.863 --> 02:18:40.083]  Fabled enemies.

[02:18:47.625 --> 02:18:51.206]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[02:18:55.393 --> 02:18:57.354]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[02:18:57.354 --> 02:19:00.516]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[02:19:00.516 --> 02:19:09.142]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[02:19:09.142 --> 02:19:12.805]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[02:19:12.805 --> 02:19:17.368]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[02:19:17.368 --> 02:19:18.929]  How much are you willing to lose?
[02:19:19.329 --> 02:19:20.389]  Take action now!

[02:19:29.172 --> 02:19:32.493]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[02:19:32.493 --> 02:19:39.234]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.

[02:20:46.841 --> 02:20:47.682]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:47.682 --> 02:20:49.003]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:06.856 --> 02:21:08.117]  David Zirin is our guest.
[02:21:08.117 --> 02:21:15.383]  He's written for the Washington Post, New York Daily News, New York Newsday, Baltimore Sun, Houston Chronicle, the list goes on and on.
[02:21:15.383 --> 02:21:19.286]  Appears on national TV, does his own radio show.
[02:21:19.286 --> 02:21:21.307]  And he's just written The People's History of Sports.
[02:21:21.307 --> 02:21:22.548]  Sounds like a great book to read.
[02:21:22.548 --> 02:21:26.331]  I've got to tell you, most of these sports writers bore me to death.
[02:21:26.331 --> 02:21:26.972]  And they also
[02:21:28.150 --> 02:21:31.213]  Don't have the state police spying on him for no reason.
[02:21:31.213 --> 02:21:32.574]  That's why he's here.
[02:21:32.574 --> 02:21:37.419]  But he's also knows the Tillmans, talked to them, written about it, exposed what's going on.
[02:21:37.419 --> 02:21:43.004]  Yeah, I mean, they lied over and over again, then they shot him up close from just a few yards away in the face.
[02:21:44.204 --> 02:21:46.685]  Uh, and I talked to his brother and others years ago.
[02:21:46.685 --> 02:21:50.087]  You know, he was writing letters home saying he was going to go public.
[02:21:50.087 --> 02:22:00.811]  In the time we've got left, I mean, I'm fleshing out the evidence, but it all points towards a snuff, a frag, a murder, uh, so that he wouldn't come home and be a poster boy against the war.
[02:22:00.811 --> 02:22:03.552]  Uh, I mean, what else could it be?
[02:22:03.552 --> 02:22:05.933]  Or was it some guys that were jealous of him?
[02:22:05.933 --> 02:22:08.574]  I mean, it certainly looks like it was done on purpose.
[02:22:09.787 --> 02:22:10.707]  It certainly does.
[02:22:10.707 --> 02:22:22.312]  I mean, I spoke at Great Lamp with his mom, Mary, and it's her belief, and as much as I've studied this, I mean, she's somebody who's been over this with a fine-tooth comb because she wants justice for her son.
[02:22:22.312 --> 02:22:37.558]  And she's convinced that it was, the entire tragedy, was a result of the horrible chaos of the moment, and then people in a fumbling, bumbling, embarrassing way trying to cover it up, followed by
[02:22:38.490 --> 02:22:48.756]  A series of, you know how the armed forces work, just a series of slow, bureaucratic grinding-ness that just made the entire thing worse every step of the way.
[02:22:48.756 --> 02:22:51.077]  Well, I don't think she knows how to use an M-16, though.
[02:22:51.077 --> 02:22:58.841]  The point is, he's waving his arms saying, stop shooting, and they run up and shoot him, and then it's all an accident and they cover it up?
[02:22:58.841 --> 02:23:01.122]  Yeah, yeah, I know that's what I'm saying.
[02:23:01.122 --> 02:23:04.704]  I mean, there's a lot about that that doesn't pass the smell test.
[02:23:04.704 --> 02:23:05.585]  So you don't agree with them?
[02:23:06.661 --> 02:23:12.984]  Well, I mean, I certainly respect the angle from which she is taking it.
[02:23:12.984 --> 02:23:17.466]  I am very, very skeptical about coincidences.
[02:23:17.466 --> 02:23:31.191]  And for all the brave men and women who have died overseas, we have to remember that only a very small percentage of the, I believe it's over a million, troops who have cycled through have actually died.
[02:23:31.191 --> 02:23:32.692]  And when one of them happens to be
[02:23:33.647 --> 02:23:35.489]  The most famous one.
[02:23:35.489 --> 02:23:40.595]  And it happens to happen concurrent with the Abu Ghraib photos getting released.
[02:23:40.595 --> 02:23:45.140]  The worst public relations disaster for the Pentagon.
[02:23:45.140 --> 02:23:51.067]  It's just, I mean, I just wasn't brave to believe in coincidence.
[02:23:51.067 --> 02:23:53.230]  Well, he was planning to go public against the war.
[02:23:54.218 --> 02:23:54.799]  That's it too.
[02:23:54.799 --> 02:23:58.203]  He was writing letters to people like Noam Chomsky.
[02:23:58.203 --> 02:24:04.210]  He was making a true effort to intellectually come to terms with what was happening with U.S.
[02:24:04.210 --> 02:24:05.491]  foreign policy.
[02:24:05.491 --> 02:24:09.076]  That's one of the other things when I say it was an American tragedy.
[02:24:09.076 --> 02:24:14.282]  It's hard not to view him as being a microcosm or a representative of the country as a whole.
[02:24:14.882 --> 02:24:23.445]  You know, angry and gung-ho after 9-11, and yet going into Iraq and not understanding the logic of that.
[02:24:23.445 --> 02:24:28.447]  And then that being a pretext for him starting to question the broader war on terror.
[02:24:28.447 --> 02:24:36.149]  Well, I mean, the way they built him up to a God level, and then what would have happened if he would have come home and spoke out against the wars he was planning to do?
[02:24:36.149 --> 02:24:37.550]  I mean, they just couldn't put up with that.
[02:24:38.771 --> 02:24:41.012]  And then all the mysterious things and the different stories.
[02:24:41.012 --> 02:24:47.416]  I mean, I'm sorry, troops don't run up five feet from you in broad daylight if you're begging and screaming in English and shoot you in the face.
[02:24:47.416 --> 02:24:48.877]  I mean, come on.
[02:24:48.877 --> 02:24:53.359]  It's not something I understand to be perfectly fine to do.
[02:24:53.359 --> 02:24:54.060]  Well, we know this.
[02:24:54.060 --> 02:24:56.361]  It became a PR disaster for him one way or the other.
[02:24:56.361 --> 02:24:58.823]  It sure did.
[02:24:58.823 --> 02:25:00.604]  It sure did.
[02:25:00.604 --> 02:25:05.907]  But I really do think, though, that the twin impact of the Abu Ghraib photos with
[02:25:06.744 --> 02:25:11.729]  The death of Tillman in a Friendly Fire situation would have been ridiculous.
[02:25:11.729 --> 02:25:16.293]  We have to remember, they gave Tillman the Silver Star posthumously.
[02:25:16.293 --> 02:25:20.857]  The Silver Star is only reserved for death in the theater of active combat.
[02:25:20.857 --> 02:25:28.324]  It's specifically not reserved for Friendly Fire, which gives you an idea about the level of cover-up that was involved.
[02:25:31.505 --> 02:25:38.787]  Well, you know that the original Army doctors that first saw the body said that it looked like foul play.
[02:25:38.787 --> 02:25:40.588]  No, yes, yes, absolutely.
[02:25:40.588 --> 02:25:41.728]  Absolutely.
[02:25:41.728 --> 02:25:50.631]  I mean, I really do believe this entire thing is the equivalent of when you see a little thread off of a sweater and you pull it.
[02:25:51.312 --> 02:25:54.254]  And just the more you pull it, the more it unravels.
[02:25:54.254 --> 02:25:59.437]  Well, an army doctor who's a forensics investigator, that's what they look at is battle wounds.
[02:25:59.437 --> 02:26:06.142]  And they said, this looks like it is probably, I can pull up the, I'm sure you've seen the form, but they marked down, it looks like he was murdered.
[02:26:06.142 --> 02:26:08.263]  Looks like this was a hit.
[02:26:08.263 --> 02:26:09.984]  No, this is what we're talking about.
[02:26:09.984 --> 02:26:11.866]  And he got powder burns on his face.
[02:26:11.866 --> 02:26:13.267]  I mean, give me a break.
[02:26:13.267 --> 02:26:15.388]  This is what we're talking about.
[02:26:15.388 --> 02:26:17.229]  And it's nothing pleasant.
[02:26:17.229 --> 02:26:19.911]  Like I said, it's an American tragedy and an American crime.
[02:26:20.723 --> 02:26:25.404]  Well, great talking to you, and we appreciate all the work you're doing.
[02:26:25.404 --> 02:26:34.406]  Dave Zirin, we'll talk to you again coming up in December about your book, The People's History of Sports, because I like your angle on stuff, and we appreciate your time.
[02:26:34.406 --> 02:26:35.567]  Wonderful.
[02:26:35.567 --> 02:26:36.747]  I'll talk to you soon.
[02:26:36.747 --> 02:26:37.787]  All right, there he goes, folks.
[02:26:37.787 --> 02:26:40.748]  We're going to come back and get into your phone calls and a bunch of news.
[02:26:40.748 --> 02:26:42.989]  I've got a bunch of audio clips I haven't gotten to yet.
[02:26:42.989 --> 02:26:44.769]  And David Rigg-Riffin and Steven Jones are joining us.
[02:26:45.695 --> 02:26:49.644]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:26:49.644 --> 02:26:52.330]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:26:55.362 --> 02:26:59.064]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[02:26:59.064 --> 02:27:04.807]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[02:27:04.807 --> 02:27:09.149]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[02:27:09.149 --> 02:27:11.591]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[02:27:11.591 --> 02:27:15.913]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota.
[02:27:15.913 --> 02:27:16.693]  We're good to go!
[02:27:40.325 --> 02:27:44.188]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do.
[02:28:03.302 --> 02:28:04.646]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:28:04.646 --> 02:28:11.005]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:28:11.670 --> 02:28:20.576]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[02:28:20.576 --> 02:28:27.660]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:28:27.660 --> 02:28:30.822]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:28:30.822 --> 02:28:36.606]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:28:36.606 --> 02:28:39.188]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[02:28:39.688 --> 02:28:45.754]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[02:28:45.754 --> 02:28:48.657]  Or order the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:28:48.657 --> 02:28:53.562]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[02:28:54.955 --> 02:28:58.418]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:28:58.418 --> 02:29:02.202]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:29:02.202 --> 02:29:08.528]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[02:29:08.528 --> 02:29:13.152]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:29:13.152 --> 02:29:16.015]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly.
[02:29:16.375 --> 02:29:22.579]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:29:22.579 --> 02:29:27.081]  Run sump pumps, short-wave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:29:27.081 --> 02:29:33.205]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:29:33.205 --> 02:29:38.448]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready with the solar power generator from Solutions from Science.

[02:29:46.292 --> 02:29:46.792]  Don't wait.
[02:29:46.792 --> 02:29:47.432]  Call today.
[02:29:47.432 --> 02:29:49.193]  I don't wanna know where to go.
[02:29:49.193 --> 02:29:51.294]  I don't wanna know where to go.
[02:29:51.294 --> 02:29:52.815]  Give me the dough.
[02:29:52.815 --> 02:29:57.377]  I don't wanna know where to go.
[02:29:57.377 --> 02:29:59.638]  I don't wanna know where to go.
[02:29:59.638 --> 02:30:00.879]  Give me the dough.
[02:30:00.879 --> 02:30:03.000]  I don't wanna know where to go.
[02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.841]  I don't wanna know where to go.
[02:30:05.841 --> 02:30:06.982]  Give me the dough.
[02:30:06.982 --> 02:30:09.063]  I don't wanna know where to go.
[02:30:18.843 --> 02:30:19.624]  Give me the gold!
[02:30:19.624 --> 02:30:21.024]  I want the gold!
[02:30:21.024 --> 02:30:23.146]  I want the gold!
[02:30:23.146 --> 02:30:25.227]  I want the gold!
[02:30:25.227 --> 02:30:26.628]  I want the gold!
[02:30:26.628 --> 02:30:27.808]  I want the gold!
[02:30:27.808 --> 02:30:28.889]  I want the gold!
[02:30:28.889 --> 02:30:30.330]  Give me the gold!
[02:30:30.330 --> 02:30:31.451]  I want the gold!
[02:30:31.451 --> 02:30:32.651]  I want the gold!
[02:30:32.651 --> 02:30:35.313]  Alright folks, gotta have some fun here.
[02:30:35.313 --> 02:30:42.917]  You know, it's got like hundreds of millions of views online, literally.
[02:30:42.917 --> 02:30:45.479]  It's a newscast, but these locals think there's a leprechaun
[02:30:46.576 --> 02:30:48.457]  In a tree.
[02:30:48.457 --> 02:30:53.219]  And we all come out and say to the leprechaun, give me, give me, give me the gold.
[02:30:53.219 --> 02:30:55.199]  So that's why we're playing that little remix.
[02:30:55.199 --> 02:30:57.960]  They're having some fun because there's so much craziness going on.
[02:30:57.960 --> 02:31:01.682]  Paul, Ivan, Vinny, Wayne, Adam, I promise we're getting to all of you.
[02:31:01.682 --> 02:31:12.806]  Paul in the Netherlands, after the leprechaun leaves us in five minutes, the Swedish leprechaun, he's a, he is a, he's a traveling student.
[02:31:13.897 --> 02:31:17.038]  A foreign student, a leprechaun, Ted Anderson.
[02:31:17.038 --> 02:31:22.480]  But no, to get serious here, you know, we're trying to blunt the bad news.
[02:31:22.480 --> 02:31:22.780]  U.S.
[02:31:22.780 --> 02:31:27.862]  home construction sinks to all-time record low.
[02:31:27.862 --> 02:31:33.764]  Charts predict Dow Jones Industrial Average to go down to 6,000 points in less than a month.
[02:31:33.764 --> 02:31:37.046]  That's not just our experts, that's CNBC's experts.
[02:31:37.046 --> 02:31:37.786]  Paulson says
[02:31:39.244 --> 02:31:41.545]  None of the bailout goes to American industry.
[02:31:41.545 --> 02:31:44.787]  And by the way, I'm against the bailout for the car people.
[02:31:44.787 --> 02:31:47.028]  The automakers.
[02:31:47.028 --> 02:31:54.972]  But if you're gonna give $5 trillion to offshore banks to buy up stock, that's what they're doing, and then I gotta pay for it as a taxpayer?
[02:31:54.972 --> 02:31:58.894]  I'd rather give it to GM workers making $75 an hour.
[02:31:58.894 --> 02:31:59.994]  And by the way, all of them don't.
[02:31:59.994 --> 02:32:00.935]  A very small percentage do.
[02:32:00.935 --> 02:32:02.936]  The media uses that.
[02:32:02.936 --> 02:32:05.157]  So, yeah.
[02:32:05.157 --> 02:32:07.058]  Not $25 billion for the automakers,
[02:32:08.211 --> 02:32:10.773]  We're not going to make cars there anymore, folks.
[02:32:10.773 --> 02:32:12.454]  We don't make anything.
[02:32:12.454 --> 02:32:14.815]  Nothing for them, and it probably wouldn't save them down the road.
[02:32:14.815 --> 02:32:29.864]  I don't know what's bad news, and I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up, because Ted, the owner of the Genesis Network, and also Minus Resources, 30 years in gold and silver brokerage, Ted has some of the store closure lists.
[02:32:29.864 --> 02:32:32.526]  Now, I've got them that are a thousand names long.
[02:32:32.526 --> 02:32:36.248]  We're not going to read all these, but some of the big ones, you know, it's not just Circuit City.
[02:32:37.555 --> 02:32:41.296]  And again, I probably go out to eat about twice a week when I work late.
[02:32:41.296 --> 02:32:45.037]  About a third of the restaurants I try to go to and eat at, they're gone.
[02:32:45.037 --> 02:32:46.777]  Ted Anderson, tell us what's going on there.
[02:32:46.777 --> 02:33:00.300]  Yeah, okay, I mean obviously Circus City is at the top of the list, but you've got Ann Taylor, you've got Lane Bryant, Eddie Bauer, Fashion Bug, Catherine's, the Cachet, Talbot's closing down, J. Joe, Gap,
[02:33:00.928 --> 02:33:10.752]  Footlocker, Wicks, Levitz, Bombay closing, Zales, Whitehall, Pagoda, Disney.
[02:33:10.752 --> 02:33:13.473]  Now Disney has 98 stores they're shutting down.
[02:33:13.473 --> 02:33:16.214]  Home Depot is going to close 15 stores.
[02:33:16.214 --> 02:33:28.699]  Macy's 9 stores, Linen and Things, Movie Gallery, Pacific Sunwear, Pep Boys, Sprint Nextel, JC Penney's, now there's a big name, Ethan Allen, Wilson Leather closing down.
[02:33:29.899 --> 02:33:30.680]  Sharper image.
[02:33:30.680 --> 02:33:31.781]  And there's another one.
[02:33:31.781 --> 02:33:34.782]  I mean, people are thinking about buying gift cards.
[02:33:34.782 --> 02:33:36.103]  I mean, I won't even do that this year.
[02:33:36.103 --> 02:33:38.744]  There's just too many stores that are going to be gone.
[02:33:38.744 --> 02:33:41.606]  KB Toys, Lowell's, Dillard's.
[02:33:41.606 --> 02:33:44.288]  I mean, there's a lot more on the list.
[02:33:44.288 --> 02:33:46.309]  We just don't have time to keep going with that.
[02:33:46.309 --> 02:33:50.291]  I mean, the GM thing is just one part of the whole segment.
[02:33:50.291 --> 02:33:55.634]  We're talking about the comics now, not having enough gold to deliver and make good on all
[02:33:55.794 --> 02:33:56.876]  That's a big deal.
[02:33:56.876 --> 02:33:58.298]  We told people about this a month ago.
[02:33:58.298 --> 02:33:59.641]  Now it's mainstream news.
[02:33:59.641 --> 02:34:01.344]  As usual, what we tell you is later news.
[02:34:02.225 --> 02:34:05.947]  Explain that briefly, like Max Keiser did, for those that don't know.
[02:34:05.947 --> 02:34:13.231]  The paper gold crowd has been trying to suppress the price of gold, but now people are demanding physical delivery, and then of course they don't have it.
[02:34:13.231 --> 02:34:15.092]  Explain that in a naked shorting.
[02:34:15.092 --> 02:34:17.213]  It's like the fractional reserve banking system.
[02:34:17.213 --> 02:34:24.797]  When you're dealing with the comics, most trades close, and the contracts expire worthless.
[02:34:24.797 --> 02:34:31.421]  They don't take delivery, they just sell them to the next guy, and to the next guy, until the time value's gone, and then the contract's gone.
[02:34:32.141 --> 02:34:38.805]  If you have a contract to buy or sell and if you let it expire it means that it goes away and nothing ever happens with it.
[02:34:38.805 --> 02:34:42.667]  The same holds true in the options market.
[02:34:42.667 --> 02:34:49.250]  But now people are buying the ComEx contracts and they're wanting to take delivery and there's just simply not enough gold to do it.
[02:34:49.250 --> 02:34:52.552]  And so the physical market itself is reflecting the real prices of gold.
[02:34:52.932 --> 02:35:00.137]  Yeah, because people can buy a ComEx for $750, and then they think, well, I'll just take physical delivery and I'll be able to sell it for $900.
[02:35:00.137 --> 02:35:03.819]  People are paying premiums everywhere, and they're saying, sorry, we don't have the gold.
[02:35:03.819 --> 02:35:10.484]  Yeah, and then you have what's called a force majeure, and the contract settles and there is no delivery on the gold.
[02:35:10.484 --> 02:35:14.727]  There's just not enough gold to go around, and of course that market is all smoke and mirrors.
[02:35:14.727 --> 02:35:15.847]  It's all leverage.
[02:35:15.847 --> 02:35:19.430]  People are putting in 10% of their money to leverage 100% of the deal.
[02:35:19.430 --> 02:35:19.890]  So 90% of it is all loans.
[02:35:23.012 --> 02:35:25.193]  I know where the gold's at.
[02:35:25.193 --> 02:35:26.414]  The leprechaun got it.
[02:35:40.183 --> 02:35:42.524]  Today, it's seen a high of $764.30.
[02:35:42.524 --> 02:35:50.048]  And right now, it's up $2, and it's trading for $740.
[02:35:50.048 --> 02:35:58.732]  And what's going to happen is you're going to see $800 an ounce, and it's coming so slowly and so steadily that you'll hardly even know it happened.
[02:35:58.732 --> 02:36:01.393]  Look, it's real simple.
[02:36:01.393 --> 02:36:02.734]  They are killing the dollar.
[02:36:02.734 --> 02:36:03.995]  They've decided to do it.
[02:36:03.995 --> 02:36:08.377]  And so, in the interim, they're going to run it up and print as many as they can.
[02:36:09.187 --> 02:36:09.688]  We're good to go.
[02:36:29.867 --> 02:36:39.191]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, most gold brokerage houses and outfits that have been around decades, they're sold out, or they can sell you one coin at huge 30-40% premiums.
[02:36:39.191 --> 02:36:41.031]  I've explained this and explained this.
[02:36:41.031 --> 02:36:41.552]  You are crazy!
[02:36:43.055 --> 02:36:44.876]  If you don't buy some silver and gold.
[02:36:44.876 --> 02:36:47.298]  And I'm not saying get rid of all your stocks, all your bonds.
[02:36:47.298 --> 02:36:50.200]  You know, diversification is always king.
[02:36:50.200 --> 02:37:01.568]  But for friends, for family, you know, for children, it's great to give them, you know, some silver, some gold, you know, to have them lock it up in a safe or, you know, have them put it in the mattress, whatever.
[02:37:01.568 --> 02:37:06.431]  It's a great gift to teach people about real money with this Christmas season coming up.
[02:37:06.431 --> 02:37:11.034]  But regardless, give your children the gift of having some nest egg
[02:37:12.295 --> 02:37:23.305]  I mean, Ted, if you Google, you know, Congress looks at taking over pension funds, or taxing pension funds in 401ks, I mean, they're really getting ready to go after those, Ted.
[02:37:23.305 --> 02:37:30.011]  Well, they sure are, and they have to do it because they have to step up and they have to bail out just about everything that has trouble.
[02:37:30.011 --> 02:37:32.814]  And where do you suppose are coming up with all this money?
[02:37:33.314 --> 02:37:37.116]  You know, I mean, it's all printed money, and yeah, they want to take control.
[02:37:37.116 --> 02:37:43.018]  They really want to get people in the grasp of government.
[02:37:43.018 --> 02:37:55.362]  A big government is coming, and it's not only just our current government elected officials, but it's the banking institutions that are meeting like this G40 meeting that we just had, the G20 meeting we just had.
[02:37:57.404 --> 02:38:06.633]  It looks really gloomy out there, and as a matter of fact, the reason why gold ran up today is because the Mideastern countries were deciding that they wanted to get out of the U.S.
[02:38:06.633 --> 02:38:09.015]  dollar, and they're going to switch it into gold.
[02:38:09.015 --> 02:38:10.357]  That's right.
[02:38:10.357 --> 02:38:16.683]  Iran, three days ago, on $75 billion of their reserves, pulled it out of the U.S.
[02:38:16.683 --> 02:38:19.706]  and bought gold, and then shipped it to Tehran.
[02:38:21.050 --> 02:38:23.151]  Venezuela and others are doing the same thing.
[02:38:23.151 --> 02:38:32.513]  And now they have former CIA employee, Zawahiri, threatens America again, saying they're going to bomb us to show Barack Obama.
[02:38:32.513 --> 02:38:38.675]  All that'll do is let Barack Obama become more popular and attack more countries, which is why the globalists are going to attack themselves.
[02:38:38.675 --> 02:38:40.515]  This is really shaping up to be crazy.
[02:38:40.515 --> 02:38:41.696]  Ted, I'm going to move on to the calls.
[02:38:41.696 --> 02:38:43.236]  I appreciate you coming on, but briefly,
[02:38:44.154 --> 02:38:45.655]  You still have a few maple leaves.
[02:38:45.655 --> 02:38:48.297]  You almost sold out of those, I know.
[02:38:48.297 --> 02:38:49.618]  Folks, you can't find those anywhere.
[02:38:49.618 --> 02:38:54.000]  You've got all different sizes of American Eagles, which, again, you can't find anywhere.
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:54.961]  You've got Franks.
[02:38:54.961 --> 02:38:56.802]  You've got Sovereigns.
[02:38:56.802 --> 02:38:58.984]  You've even got some collectible coins as well.
[02:38:58.984 --> 02:39:03.807]  But everybody knows I like these bullion coins, or collector coins, close to bullion.
[02:39:03.807 --> 02:39:05.288]  Again, Ted bought a whole...
[02:39:06.188 --> 02:39:06.629]  Thank you, Ted.
[02:39:21.061 --> 02:39:24.362]  Well I know this Alex, I know I can hold the prices today.
[02:39:24.362 --> 02:39:27.082]  And I can see the prices jumping up in the marketplace too.
[02:39:27.082 --> 02:39:28.903]  I mean it's $7.64.
[02:39:28.903 --> 02:39:31.904]  If it holds there, my prices are going to have to come up too.
[02:39:31.904 --> 02:39:34.084]  I mean I did, I locked in on a lot of stuff.
[02:39:34.084 --> 02:39:35.484]  The people are buying it.
[02:39:35.484 --> 02:39:38.125]  I really appreciate the business that they're giving us.
[02:39:38.125 --> 02:39:40.786]  It obviously helps the network immensely.
[02:39:40.786 --> 02:39:41.986]  But I can tell you right now,
[02:39:42.966 --> 02:39:44.407]  I only can do so much.
[02:39:44.407 --> 02:39:46.129]  I'm buying what I can.
[02:39:46.129 --> 02:39:49.811]  I knew when gold was at $7.10 it was a buy.
[02:39:49.811 --> 02:39:51.913]  I picked up as much inventory as I could.
[02:39:51.913 --> 02:39:53.914]  Bottom line, folks, it's only going to go up.
[02:39:53.914 --> 02:39:55.275]  All the conventional wisdom says that.
[02:39:55.275 --> 02:39:55.675]  Who knows?
[02:39:55.675 --> 02:39:57.316]  But the point is, buy it now.
[02:39:57.316 --> 02:39:59.658]  We can still pass on these huge savings.
[02:39:59.658 --> 02:40:02.280]  And, Ted, you've still got all the coins I mentioned and the silver, right?
[02:40:02.540 --> 02:40:05.862]  The main price is actually, I got an $11 discount on Franks right now.
[02:40:05.862 --> 02:40:09.264]  I've got about a $22 discount on British Sovereigns.
[02:40:09.264 --> 02:40:16.169]  I have the silver dollars, the silver walking liberty half dollars, and they're currently right now at $8.90.
[02:40:16.169 --> 02:40:17.790]  The silver dollars are at $25.
[02:40:17.790 --> 02:40:20.171]  It's way more than double the price.
[02:40:20.171 --> 02:40:26.796]  We've got a good variety of things to pick from, and I would suggest that you do it now because there's a lot of problems out there.
[02:40:26.796 --> 02:40:28.617]  Now let's explain.
[02:40:28.617 --> 02:40:31.759]  Silver is down at $14 or whatever it is right now.
[02:40:32.279 --> 02:40:34.740]  And then the silver dollars everywhere are 25 bucks.
[02:40:34.740 --> 02:40:38.381]  Again, that shows the manipulation of not just gold but the silver market.
[02:40:38.381 --> 02:40:40.342]  So Ted isn't even selling you silver dollars.
[02:40:40.342 --> 02:40:44.063]  He wants to give you his half dollars that are right down there by Melt.
[02:40:44.063 --> 02:40:47.124]  Beautiful, gorgeous coins that even have some collector value.
[02:40:47.124 --> 02:40:47.664]  So 800-686-2237.
[02:40:47.664 --> 02:40:47.744]  800-686-2237.
[02:40:47.744 --> 02:40:51.666]  Let's go out of this segment and into your phone calls with Ted Anderson's new theme song,
[02:40:59.228 --> 02:41:02.890]  Here is Ted singing, I want to know where the gold at.
[02:41:02.890 --> 02:41:06.812]  Again, 800-686-2237.
[02:41:06.812 --> 02:41:11.074]  And the brokers are generally there until midnight last night.
[02:41:11.074 --> 02:41:14.756]  I know they left at about 10 last night.
[02:41:14.756 --> 02:41:16.057]  But they are there in the evenings, 800-686-2237.
[02:41:16.057 --> 02:41:17.598]  Take advantage of this today, 800-686-2237.
[02:41:17.598 --> 02:41:18.718]  Ted, thanks for having us.
[02:41:26.474 --> 02:41:27.354]  Having the network?
[02:41:27.354 --> 02:41:27.995]  Yeah, you bet.
[02:41:27.995 --> 02:41:29.095]  Thanks for having me up, Alex.
[02:41:29.095 --> 02:41:33.417]  You bet, and thanks for having the gumption to offer people such great deals.
[02:41:33.417 --> 02:41:37.059]  800-686-2237 or minusresources.com.
[02:41:37.059 --> 02:41:41.921]  Okay, you want to know where the gold's at?
[02:41:41.921 --> 02:41:43.302]  It's right there with Ted Anderson.
[02:41:43.302 --> 02:41:44.002]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:41:44.002 --> 02:41:45.103]  Okay, alright.
[02:41:45.103 --> 02:41:51.365]  Got some big guests coming up, but I want to take your phone calls right now.
[02:41:51.365 --> 02:41:52.726]  I appreciate you holding.
[02:41:52.726 --> 02:41:53.947]  Paul in the Netherlands.
[02:41:53.947 --> 02:41:54.467]  Welcome, Paul.
[02:41:55.956 --> 02:41:57.097]  Hello, Alex.
[02:41:57.097 --> 02:41:58.658]  Hello.
[02:41:58.658 --> 02:41:59.479]  Hey.
[02:41:59.479 --> 02:42:03.341]  Hey, I know where the gold is.
[02:42:03.341 --> 02:42:05.783]  I got really lucky here in the Netherlands.
[02:42:05.783 --> 02:42:16.391]  It's really odd, because there's this gold shop, as it were, near Amsterdam, and they're actually selling the gold at the actual price.
[02:42:16.391 --> 02:42:18.553]  That's official.
[02:42:18.553 --> 02:42:23.396]  It's just a company, and they don't put any interest in it.
[02:42:23.396 --> 02:42:24.157]  It's just crazy.
[02:42:24.972 --> 02:42:31.134]  Yeah, what they do is they, again, they buy it when it's low, and then they sell it when it's high, and they always have that setback.
[02:42:31.134 --> 02:42:33.894]  And yeah, there are... Europe is where Ted's getting his gold.
[02:42:33.894 --> 02:42:37.055]  I mean, it's hard to get here in the U.S.
[02:42:37.055 --> 02:42:40.636]  It's really cheap.
[02:42:40.636 --> 02:42:46.838]  I got an embarrassing lot of it, and I got really lucky, because now it's starting to run out over here, too.
[02:42:46.838 --> 02:42:47.178]  Oh, really?
[02:42:47.178 --> 02:42:47.718]  It's running out?
[02:42:47.718 --> 02:42:50.599]  Well, do you have a little pot of gold now?
[02:42:51.849 --> 02:42:57.293]  Yeah, I got the gold.
[02:42:57.293 --> 02:42:59.554]  I love it!
[02:42:59.554 --> 02:43:00.675]  Yeah, it's pretty nice.
[02:43:00.675 --> 02:43:08.300]  It's also kind of useful because even if the prices stay low, I'm a goldsmith, so I can always use it.
[02:43:08.300 --> 02:43:09.601]  Oh good, so you're in that business.
[02:43:09.601 --> 02:43:11.662]  I just got lucky.
[02:43:11.662 --> 02:43:13.523]  Anyways, we have a leprechaun calling.
[02:43:13.523 --> 02:43:15.305]  Go ahead.
[02:43:15.305 --> 02:43:16.045]  That's the secret.
[02:43:16.045 --> 02:43:17.146]  We're all really leprechauns.
[02:43:18.459 --> 02:43:20.101]  Yeah, sort of.
[02:43:20.101 --> 02:43:29.734]  Anyway, I have three subjects I wanted to talk about and try to get through them as quickly as possible.
[02:43:29.734 --> 02:43:35.361]  First to start off with is something about entertainment, and I mean movies.
[02:43:36.047 --> 02:43:42.674]  Have you ever heard of the series Firefly and of the movie that got out of it, Serenity?
[02:43:42.674 --> 02:43:43.434]  Oh, it's excellent.
[02:43:43.434 --> 02:43:45.617]  Yeah, it's total anti-New World Order.
[02:43:45.617 --> 02:43:51.743]  It admits the government is putting Prozac into the atmosphere to make you serve their world government.
[02:43:51.743 --> 02:43:53.745]  And yeah, it's all total anti-New World Order.
[02:43:54.651 --> 02:44:03.436]  I can really recommend it to everyone, and Fox, the producer, they even just cut the series down after, what was it, two seasons?
[02:44:03.436 --> 02:44:09.220]  No, it was only one season, and they wouldn't let the other shows air, even though it got high ratings.
[02:44:09.220 --> 02:44:11.181]  And then so the producer went and made his own movie.
[02:44:11.181 --> 02:44:16.044]  He's the guy that, and forget it, he's got a bunch of TV shows, like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and all that.
[02:44:16.044 --> 02:44:18.666]  He's the creator of Serenity.
[02:44:18.666 --> 02:44:20.887]  And that's the movie, the TV show is Firefly.
[02:44:22.020 --> 02:44:31.505]  Yeah, I don't get into a lot of popular culture, but I saw that movie and liked it enough to go buy the TV show on DVD.
[02:44:31.505 --> 02:44:33.706]  Yeah, that's great.
[02:44:33.706 --> 02:44:38.989]  Okay, well let's go to the second subject, the carbon tax thing.
[02:44:38.989 --> 02:44:51.196]  Because, you know, if they're actually going to pull it through, and everyone's going to pay carbon tax for their own breathing and for their fuels and their cars and everything, and electricity, well, I was thinking,
[02:44:52.188 --> 02:45:11.418]  There's a lot of hydrogen technology out there, and me and my friends are working on several projects on how to really make hydrogen gases really cheaply and not very dangerous, and using it to create electricity, using it to generate propulsion for cars and everything.
[02:45:11.418 --> 02:45:15.360]  Oh yeah, there are all sorts of clean systems.
[02:45:15.360 --> 02:45:18.782]  It just takes massive investment to bring it out to the general market.
[02:45:19.730 --> 02:45:34.339]  But it's not actually that hard to make because you could practically put a big can of water in your car, put a hydrogen generator in next to it, and then use it and drive for
[02:45:36.235 --> 02:45:38.237]  Indefinitely.
[02:45:38.237 --> 02:45:41.400]  You could go anywhere.
[02:45:41.400 --> 02:45:45.103]  Hydrogen is very explosive, as you know, and I appreciate your call.
[02:45:45.103 --> 02:45:48.466]  Hydrogen is very explosive, so they have all these regulations on it.
[02:45:48.466 --> 02:45:52.450]  So they're going to use phony environmentalism as a way to suppress all of that.
[02:45:52.450 --> 02:45:56.874]  But what I meant was getting it to roll out and retrofitted for the general public.
[02:45:57.822 --> 02:46:03.466]  You see, it's going to end up being some huge factory-delivered system instead of lots of local shops doing it.
[02:46:03.466 --> 02:46:05.247]  But yeah, no, no, innovation.
[02:46:05.247 --> 02:46:09.971]  One thing about the economy imploding is it is going to cause a lot of grassroots innovation.
[02:46:09.971 --> 02:46:10.751]  Good to hear from you, Paul.
[02:46:10.751 --> 02:46:14.914]  I could talk to you for hours, but I want to give everybody a chance here.
[02:46:14.914 --> 02:46:20.218]  Ivan in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:46:20.218 --> 02:46:21.219]  Ivan dropped off.
[02:46:21.219 --> 02:46:22.360]  Vinnie in California.
[02:46:23.436 --> 02:46:25.657]  Hey Alex, I know where to go to.
[02:46:25.657 --> 02:46:27.118]  Where is it?
[02:46:27.118 --> 02:46:29.319]  It's in my safe and buried under my house.
[02:46:29.319 --> 02:46:29.660]  Good.
[02:46:29.660 --> 02:46:33.582]  I love you, I love your show.
[02:46:33.582 --> 02:46:35.563]  I want to thank you for all the work that you've done.
[02:46:35.563 --> 02:46:36.543]  Just an incredible job.
[02:46:36.543 --> 02:46:41.706]  Sometimes when I think you're smoking something funny, I go and I do my own research and find out that you were right.
[02:46:41.706 --> 02:46:43.307]  I got two questions.
[02:46:43.307 --> 02:46:44.928]  I'm planning to let me get them both in.
[02:46:44.928 --> 02:46:48.970]  Number one, on Chemtrail, have you heard of the black lion?
[02:46:48.970 --> 02:46:50.791]  I sent Aaron a picture of it a while back.
[02:46:50.791 --> 02:46:51.512]  Do you know what that is?
[02:46:53.223 --> 02:46:55.024]  No, it's called the Black Line.
[02:46:55.024 --> 02:46:56.685]  Yeah, it's called the Black Line.
[02:46:56.685 --> 02:47:01.207]  I sent Aaron a picture, and what it is is I've noticed it when I was in Indianapolis.
[02:47:01.207 --> 02:47:08.010]  I live in Southern California, and we saw him spraying, and then as soon as the spray stopped, you could see a black continuation of the line.
[02:47:08.010 --> 02:47:13.813]  It just happened instantly, almost like it was a track or like an exhausting, but it was way too fast.
[02:47:13.813 --> 02:47:19.115]  I mean, you'd have to go hyperspeed in order to get it to finish, but if you could take a look at that when you get a chance, I sent it to Aaron.
[02:47:19.155 --> 02:47:23.217]  It's like they're energizing it with their antenna arrays.
[02:47:23.217 --> 02:47:24.777]  Now I know what a black line is.
[02:47:24.777 --> 02:47:28.219]  People have witnessed these being energized, changing colors.
[02:47:28.219 --> 02:47:29.179]  I've seen it.
[02:47:29.179 --> 02:47:38.743]  And the government admits, and now declassified, that they spray aerosols and then they energize them with these ground antennas in secret projects.
[02:47:38.743 --> 02:47:43.645]  So, yes, they're using radio systems to
[02:47:44.748 --> 02:47:46.009]  Who knows what they're doing?
[02:47:46.009 --> 02:47:49.193]  A lot of it's declassified, but only that they're doing secret tests.
[02:47:49.193 --> 02:47:51.575]  Anything else you want to add there, Vinny?
[02:47:51.575 --> 02:47:52.376]  Stay there, Vinny.
[02:47:52.376 --> 02:47:53.317]  Stay there, Vinny.
[02:47:53.317 --> 02:47:55.319]  And then Wayne and Adam and Troy.
[02:47:55.319 --> 02:48:02.246]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:48:02.246 --> 02:48:03.907]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:48:04.868 --> 02:48:06.430]  But who is the enemy?
[02:48:06.430 --> 02:48:07.411]  Bin Laden.
[02:48:07.411 --> 02:48:08.131]  This is his M.O.s.
[02:48:08.131 --> 02:48:09.593]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:48:09.593 --> 02:48:11.574]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:48:11.574 --> 02:48:18.741]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:48:18.741 --> 02:48:19.221]  Some U.S.
[02:48:19.221 --> 02:48:24.867]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:48:25.567 --> 02:48:29.049]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:48:29.049 --> 02:48:32.150]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:48:56.008 --> 02:48:59.411]  Fuel prices are up and down, biting into everyone's budget.

[02:51:10.293 --> 02:51:20.177]  Okay, going back to Vinnie in California, on the Schwarzenegger, he said global warming is causing the fires.
[02:51:20.177 --> 02:51:34.242]  There's always fires every year all over Southern and Central California, in the Northern, and of course, it was, as we said a week ago, college kids not putting out a fire, and illegal aliens,
[02:51:36.110 --> 02:51:46.594]  Out there in the camps, there's camps all over Mexico, Northern Mexico, into California, where the people live, not attacking them, they just, you know, where there's fires outside, you get fires.
[02:51:46.594 --> 02:51:48.074]  No, that's not it.
[02:51:48.074 --> 02:51:51.936]  The problem is the, the problem is the global warming.
[02:51:51.936 --> 02:51:52.976]  We need to attack you.
[02:51:52.976 --> 02:51:54.517]  I will save you.
[02:51:54.517 --> 02:51:58.358]  All right, going back to, um, Vinny, Vinny, go ahead.
[02:51:59.227 --> 02:51:59.627]  Alright, cool.
[02:51:59.627 --> 02:52:00.608]  I appreciate the opportunity.
[02:52:00.608 --> 02:52:01.869]  I really need your help with something.
[02:52:01.869 --> 02:52:06.152]  I was in Indianapolis when Obama was there, and for two days, perfectly blue skies.
[02:52:06.152 --> 02:52:08.834]  The weather doesn't change, and as soon as he leaves, they blasted us.
[02:52:08.834 --> 02:52:12.597]  Then I come back to California, and on Halloween, it's the worst spring I've ever seen.
[02:52:12.597 --> 02:52:16.681]  I posted a video on YouTube with four trails going simultaneously.
[02:52:16.681 --> 02:52:17.701]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:52:17.701 --> 02:52:18.722]  So I'm going to take action.
[02:52:18.722 --> 02:52:20.564]  I can still maintain my business.
[02:52:20.564 --> 02:52:21.504]  I'm going to get a radio show.
[02:52:21.504 --> 02:52:25.007]  I've got the connections here in the Inland Empire in Southern California.
[02:52:25.007 --> 02:52:26.088]  My question to you is,
[02:52:26.628 --> 02:52:27.929]  I know I'm going to run into some slack.
[02:52:27.929 --> 02:52:29.310]  Who do you go get for advertisers?
[02:52:29.310 --> 02:52:31.651]  Because I know we're going to catch some heat, and I can go sell it.
[02:52:31.651 --> 02:52:33.352]  I just need to know who do I go after for advertisers.
[02:52:33.352 --> 02:52:35.074]  You know, you won't really catch heat now.
[02:52:35.074 --> 02:52:38.976]  I mean, if you're going to buy your own time, I would just do it Saturday or Sunday night.
[02:52:38.976 --> 02:52:43.939]  If you want to go for the bigger stations, and then just go on there.
[02:52:45.498 --> 02:52:48.459]  You know, get gun shops, preparedness people.
[02:52:48.459 --> 02:52:51.159]  I'd get a leprechaun sponsor, but find a good gold broker.
[02:52:51.159 --> 02:52:55.760]  I mean, I mean, I mean, there's all sorts of stuff that'll allow you to do that.
[02:52:55.760 --> 02:52:57.820]  And I mean, it shouldn't be, you know, too much.
[02:52:57.820 --> 02:53:07.462]  I mean, I mean, I mean, if you're a well-spoken guy and you sound like it, just covering issues, then that's a great way to reach out to people.
[02:53:07.462 --> 02:53:10.603]  Also, access TV, huge, very effective.
[02:53:10.603 --> 02:53:11.783]  That's how I started out 13 years ago.
[02:53:12.990 --> 02:53:13.270]  Hello, Alex.
[02:53:13.270 --> 02:53:13.790]  You got a copy?
[02:53:13.790 --> 02:53:14.110]  Yes, sir.
[02:53:43.110 --> 02:53:47.513]  Yeah, I'm a foreigner from the Great White North up here in Alberta.
[02:53:47.513 --> 02:53:50.495]  I can tell you there's no gold up here, but there's a lot of oil.
[02:53:50.495 --> 02:53:55.338]  There certainly is, but according to the government, only 1% of the oil is in North America.
[02:53:55.338 --> 02:53:58.681]  Total lie, but why not tell the public that?
[02:53:58.681 --> 02:54:03.964]  But anyways, first off, I just want to say it's an honor to finally get a chance to speak to you.
[02:54:03.964 --> 02:54:06.506]  Well, it's an honor to talk to you, my friend.
[02:54:06.506 --> 02:54:11.029]  I've been following you for about three years, and I gotta admit, I'm a little bit ashamed.
[02:54:11.673 --> 02:54:17.877]  Because all I've done really is just watch your DVDs and pretty much just listen.
[02:54:17.877 --> 02:54:22.740]  I never acted on anything and I'd be a lot better off right now if I would have.
[02:54:22.740 --> 02:54:25.382]  But I've got a three-part question for you.
[02:54:25.382 --> 02:54:27.583]  It's in regards to Obama.
[02:54:27.583 --> 02:54:38.670]  The first one, anybody can take it however they want, but do you think that the Rainbow Coalition and the NAACP are going to place undue stress and pressure on the government and the people of America?
[02:54:39.346 --> 02:54:40.808]  Now that Obama is a president?
[02:54:40.808 --> 02:54:43.930]  Do I think they're going to do what?
[02:54:43.930 --> 02:54:45.452]  Eh?
[02:54:45.452 --> 02:54:46.813]  I misunderstood you.
[02:54:46.813 --> 02:54:47.874]  What are they going to do?
[02:54:47.874 --> 02:54:49.095]  What are you asking?
[02:54:49.095 --> 02:55:00.266]  Do you feel that the NAACP and the Rainbow Coalition are going to place undue stress on the government and the people of America now that Obama is elected president?
[02:55:00.266 --> 02:55:02.108]  How are they going to do that?
[02:55:02.108 --> 02:55:03.068]  Okay, I understand the question.
[02:55:03.068 --> 02:55:03.429]  Go ahead.
[02:55:06.824 --> 02:55:24.579]  The second question is, in regards to the auto industry, do you think that they are going to allow the bailout, or are they just simply going to allow the big three to go bankrupt so that the banking coalition in Europe can drain out all the funds?
[02:55:24.579 --> 02:55:26.221]  Sure, and what's the last question?
[02:55:27.683 --> 02:55:33.172]  Uh, the last question is, uh, actually your other guest already answered it.
[02:55:33.172 --> 02:55:34.594]  I'll, uh, I'll let you go, sir.
[02:55:34.594 --> 02:55:35.315]  Thank you.

[02:55:45.752 --> 02:55:58.910]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:55:58.910 --> 02:56:02.735]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[02:56:03.075 --> 02:56:09.959]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[02:56:09.959 --> 02:56:13.361]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[02:56:13.361 --> 02:56:21.265]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[02:57:03.803 --> 02:57:06.445]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[02:57:06.445 --> 02:57:15.050]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[02:57:15.050 --> 02:57:17.432]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:57:17.432 --> 02:57:20.214]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:57:33.991 --> 02:57:37.154]  We got David Ray Griffin and Professor Stephen Jones on together.
[02:57:37.154 --> 02:57:40.217]  I thought that would be interesting to have them on both together.
[02:57:40.217 --> 02:57:46.462]  The balance of the hour, trying to answer your questions, go to your calls.
[02:57:46.462 --> 02:57:48.844]  Adam, Troy, John, we'll get to all of you.
[02:57:48.844 --> 02:57:51.046]  One way or the other.
[02:57:51.046 --> 02:57:54.609]  But, uh, to answer the question about, uh,
[02:58:01.471 --> 02:58:09.399]  The Rainbow Coalition, Jesse Jackson, all those groups, they're going to be thrown to the back of the bus by Barack Obama.
[02:58:09.399 --> 02:58:14.163]  You know, he'll go speak to their groups, but that's about it.
[02:58:14.163 --> 02:58:21.710]  Obama isn't going to want to upset, you know, lily-white America too much with all of that.
[02:58:21.710 --> 02:58:26.575]  In fact, that's why they want a black president of the New World Order, is so they can carry out
[02:58:27.538 --> 02:58:30.920]  All of this corruption carry out squeezing of the poor.
[02:58:30.920 --> 02:58:33.841]  It's called left cover.
[02:58:33.841 --> 02:58:43.787]  And so now he can warmonger and spy and do everything, but the left just can't criticize a black guy.
[02:58:43.787 --> 02:58:46.028]  And so it means they can move the ball on the field.
[02:58:46.028 --> 02:58:49.130]  I don't know what's going to happen with the big three automakers.
[02:58:49.130 --> 02:58:55.013]  They'll probably just get bought up or merged with Toyota, Nissan, Datsun.
[02:58:56.681 --> 02:59:06.466]  Some of the other companies, German companies, you know, Daimler, Chrysler, they're going to get reorganized.
[02:59:06.466 --> 02:59:11.809]  $25 billion, $50 billion, it's not going to bail them out.
[02:59:11.809 --> 02:59:13.990]  The real economy is dying by design.
[02:59:13.990 --> 02:59:15.391]  We were put in this position.
[02:59:15.391 --> 02:59:18.913]  The bankers did everything they could to kill the economy, then they cut the credit off.
[02:59:24.733 --> 02:59:29.857]  So, I think you'll end up having some smaller bailout in the interim.
[02:59:29.857 --> 02:59:32.019]  But again, I don't have a crystal ball.
[02:59:32.019 --> 02:59:37.243]  Usually when you think I'm predicting something, I'm only reading what the globalists have said they're going to do.
[02:59:37.243 --> 02:59:43.288]  We have articles up on PrisonPlanet.com right now where they openly admit global warming's fake, they're going to use it to enslave us.
[02:59:43.288 --> 02:59:49.293]  I mean, they admit they're building FEMA camps, and they admit they want our guns.
[02:59:49.293 --> 02:59:51.615]  I mean, I'm only covering what they say they're going to do.
[02:59:51.615 --> 02:59:53.317]  They aren't being very clear on the
[02:59:54.361 --> 02:59:54.621]  Hello?
[02:59:54.621 --> 02:59:54.741]  Hi.
[02:59:54.741 --> 02:59:54.881]  Hi man.
[03:00:23.925 --> 03:00:33.528]  Man, I know your show, and I know pretty much that you've got generally the same ideas as myself and a lot of Americans.
[03:00:33.528 --> 03:00:48.994]  But, man, I've been doing so much research, and I'm just getting to the point where I'm trying to figure out exactly what we need to do as Americans to wake up other Americans and be like, look, these things are there.
[03:00:48.994 --> 03:00:49.494]  They're here.
[03:00:49.494 --> 03:00:50.774]  What do you think?
[03:00:54.034 --> 03:00:57.395]  We need individuals to pull all sorts of stunts.
[03:00:57.395 --> 03:00:59.776]  Let's say you own a printing company.
[03:00:59.776 --> 03:01:06.858]  Put out a fake, you know, with a thousand copies or ten thousand copy newspaper, your local paper.
[03:01:06.858 --> 03:01:20.721]  Get the same typeset, make it look the same and then write up little blurbs with real information in it and then that will end up being on all your local news about that stunt and then those issues that are in the article will get out.
[03:01:20.721 --> 03:01:22.282]  Same thing just happened in New York or
[03:01:23.766 --> 03:01:25.587]  Micro-FMs.
[03:01:25.587 --> 03:01:32.170]  As long as you're not interfering with a commercial station, and as long as people are quiet about it, just put them up and let them be there.
[03:01:32.170 --> 03:01:33.591]  People won't even know where it's coming from.
[03:01:33.591 --> 03:01:35.652]  Have a local micro-FM.
[03:01:35.652 --> 03:01:42.615]  You know, carry Genesis Network or, you know, whatever you want, and put out the truth that way on the FM dial.
[03:01:42.615 --> 03:01:49.018]  Access TV, making copies of films, emailing your own email list with films, talking to your neighbors, talking to your church.
[03:01:49.018 --> 03:01:49.778]  Just, just every...
[03:01:49.958 --> 03:01:54.001]  Look, people have this image that we have to all fix everything ourselves individually.
[03:01:54.001 --> 03:01:57.744]  No, it's all of us doing a little something.
[03:01:57.744 --> 03:02:01.226]  And, I mean, does that answer your question?
[03:02:01.226 --> 03:02:03.187]  To an extent.
[03:02:03.187 --> 03:02:08.591]  I also have another question for you, and I haven't listened too much, so I don't know if you've already talked about this.
[03:02:08.591 --> 03:02:12.074]  Do you know much about, like, Planet X and... It's not real.
[03:02:12.074 --> 03:02:12.674]  It's not real.
[03:02:14.535 --> 03:02:14.875]  You know what?
[03:02:14.875 --> 03:02:15.756]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[03:02:15.756 --> 03:02:18.217]  During breaks, I'm going to be taking calls just for the internet audience.
[03:02:18.217 --> 03:02:19.478]  Stay with us.
[03:02:19.478 --> 03:02:22.559]  I'll answer your question in the next break.
[03:02:22.559 --> 03:02:23.180]  Hello, friends.
[03:02:23.180 --> 03:02:24.240]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:02:24.240 --> 03:02:29.003]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:02:29.003 --> 03:02:31.944]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:02:31.944 --> 03:02:35.006]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:02:35.006 --> 03:02:36.487]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome.
[03:02:36.687 --> 03:02:41.130]  And begged for FEMA to take care of your family, in any emergency, if you simply prepare.
[03:02:41.130 --> 03:02:46.914]  Our elected representatives wanted a good ol' boy bailout for the special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it.
[03:02:46.914 --> 03:02:48.755]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[03:02:48.755 --> 03:02:52.717]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[03:02:52.717 --> 03:02:55.539]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[03:02:55.539 --> 03:03:04.345]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food, beyond many Americans' reach.
[03:03:04.665 --> 03:03:11.767]  In pre-Nazi Germany superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days, until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[03:03:11.767 --> 03:03:16.207]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[03:03:16.207 --> 03:03:21.909]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[03:03:21.909 --> 03:03:25.149]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[03:03:25.149 --> 03:03:28.290]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[03:03:28.510 --> 03:03:30.312]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[03:03:30.312 --> 03:03:34.395]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[03:03:34.395 --> 03:03:38.539]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[03:03:38.539 --> 03:03:46.065]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[03:03:46.065 --> 03:03:50.008]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[03:03:50.008 --> 03:03:52.871]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:03:53.231 --> 03:04:00.215]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[03:04:00.215 --> 03:04:03.496]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[03:04:03.496 --> 03:04:04.417]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[03:04:04.417 --> 03:04:08.639]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[03:04:26.252 --> 03:04:27.393]  Take action today.
[03:04:27.393 --> 03:04:29.895]  The first step is getting storable food.
[03:04:29.895 --> 03:04:35.160]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:35.160 --> 03:04:37.422]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:04:39.605 --> 03:04:44.637]  Welcome, welcome, welcome on this 19th day of November 2008.
[03:04:44.637 --> 03:04:48.065]  Got about 52 minutes left in this coast-to-coast broadcast.
[03:04:49.246 --> 03:04:58.031]  We are live, transmitting over the web at PrisonPlanet.tv on the visual, on the three-dimensional there, the two-dimensional.
[03:04:58.031 --> 03:05:06.196]  And we are going over the radio as well on the MNFM dial, global shortwave, the internet at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:05:06.196 --> 03:05:11.619]  Don't forget, for this month in November into December, you get five months free at PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:05:13.340 --> 03:05:26.352]  All of my films are super high quality, hundreds of weekly TV reports, extras, a bunch of other films, four and a half years up and running, thousands of pieces of media, and your membership at PrisonPlanet.tv also makes this radio show.
[03:05:27.449 --> 03:05:34.352]  and future films possible, so be sure and check out the five months free right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:05:34.352 --> 03:05:36.352]  Now, I thought I'd get both these guys on together.
[03:05:36.352 --> 03:05:37.933]  Something a little different.
[03:05:37.933 --> 03:05:40.854]  I mean, obviously I could have one of them on for ten hours.
[03:05:40.854 --> 03:05:42.315]  They've got so much knowledge apiece.
[03:05:42.315 --> 03:05:51.298]  But we've got David Ray Griffin on with physics professor Stephen Jones together.
[03:05:51.298 --> 03:05:53.319]  And they're both big 9-11 truthers.
[03:05:53.319 --> 03:05:55.920]  And so I thought, well, originally I was going to have them on for this hour.
[03:05:57.760 --> 03:06:16.993]  Because National Geographic wanted to interview me and others about 9-11 Truth, and then I found out that the guy that was doing the piece, this Erickson, specializes in hit pieces on the JFK assassination, and I watched some of his programs, and let me tell you, I've never seen anything like it.
[03:06:16.993 --> 03:06:20.876]  So I didn't want to be a kind of a cardboard cutout in a stacked deck.
[03:06:20.876 --> 03:06:21.816]  I think Griffin and
[03:06:23.260 --> 03:06:32.422]  Jones are still being interviewed for it, but they were going to be here today and I saw the program inside the shooter car this Sunday you made for Discovery and it was ridiculous.
[03:06:32.422 --> 03:06:33.583]  It was ridiculous.
[03:06:33.583 --> 03:06:42.185]  I mean, bottom line, they admit they tore up the Chrysler, took it apart, hid the evidence, took it away, witnesses said there were bullet holes all over it, in the windshield, none of that.
[03:06:42.987 --> 03:06:46.728]  And a parade of spooks telling us that Oswald did it alone.
[03:06:46.728 --> 03:06:50.109]  And I just said, you know what, I just don't want to be around these people.
[03:06:50.109 --> 03:06:51.870]  And they're like, but you don't want to be on TV?
[03:06:51.870 --> 03:06:54.010]  No, I don't care.
[03:06:54.010 --> 03:07:03.233]  So, that said, I've never turned down an interview, but you know what, when it's this bad, I'm just not going to be part of it.
[03:07:03.233 --> 03:07:06.734]  Bringing that subject up, let's go to David Ray Griffin first, briefly.
[03:07:06.734 --> 03:07:08.835]  David, I guess you're still going to be interviewed by these guys?
[03:07:10.287 --> 03:07:16.090]  Well, it is scheduled, but it's up in the air.
[03:07:16.090 --> 03:07:25.515]  I felt the show they did on 9-11 was pretty horrible.
[03:07:25.515 --> 03:07:28.697]  I'm mixing with the JFK.
[03:07:28.697 --> 03:07:33.019]  The History Channel did that.
[03:07:33.019 --> 03:07:35.861]  I haven't seen enough of the National Geographic.
[03:07:35.861 --> 03:07:39.623]  The one show I turned down was the second BBC show.
[03:07:41.130 --> 03:07:41.590]  We're good to go.
[03:08:07.984 --> 03:08:11.926]  Okay, we're going to go over that, and I'm glad that's why you're here today.
[03:08:11.926 --> 03:08:14.988]  I was originally going to just have you talk about 9-11 evidence.
[03:08:14.988 --> 03:08:22.913]  Okay, I agreed to do BBC, and that was a hit piece and was twisted, but let me tell you, they at least acted like they were getting our side.
[03:08:22.913 --> 03:08:28.737]  This guy, this Erickson, if you watch the JFK shooter car, inside the shooter car,
[03:08:29.497 --> 03:08:31.199]  Completely one-sided.
[03:08:31.199 --> 03:08:35.363]  I have never seen a hit piece even approaching this.
[03:08:35.363 --> 03:08:40.548]  So, a word to the wise is sufficient to you and Professor Jones, both of you are professors.
[03:08:40.548 --> 03:08:46.995]  And so, I mean, believe me, I don't just back out of... I mean, I'm not afraid of going up against somebody.
[03:08:46.995 --> 03:08:48.776]  But, I mean, if I know
[03:08:49.648 --> 03:08:58.693]  Well, I want to talk about the BBC, but also the National Geographic interview that I have already had, actually, Alex, last week.
[03:09:18.922 --> 03:09:23.564]  So, starting with BBC, like I say, I was able to get a few points in.
[03:09:23.564 --> 03:09:42.290]  I was very disappointed in their headline that came out before the preliminary report from NIST, and that was that the World Trade Center 7 mystery has been solved.
[03:09:42.290 --> 03:09:46.492]  Well, you know, it's not solved until they get the report, until we have a chance to respond.
[03:09:47.566 --> 03:09:49.708]  And review what they said.
[03:09:49.708 --> 03:10:00.356]  Overall, the piece was basically a hit piece, but like David said, we were able to get a few points across, which I was very gratified that we were able to get some truth out through that medium.
[03:10:00.356 --> 03:10:08.323]  I think it's very important that we continue to reach people through the media, even if they're not entirely friendly to us.
[03:10:08.323 --> 03:10:13.947]  You know, it gives us a chance to reach people, then we can get online and learn more.
[03:10:13.947 --> 03:10:14.968]  Now Alex, I would like to
[03:10:15.555 --> 03:10:21.700]  I don't think I gave him a lot of ammunition to do a hit piece because I was very circumspect in my answers.
[03:10:21.700 --> 03:10:28.545]  There was a question, a lot of questions about the science, the technical details, the death of 9-11.
[03:10:43.991 --> 03:10:46.594]  Which I was just very pleased to answer.
[03:10:46.594 --> 03:10:48.416]  And frankly, he seemed quite interested.
[03:10:48.416 --> 03:10:51.879]  So, I don't know if this will be different from the JFK.
[03:10:51.879 --> 03:10:53.020]  I suspect it will.
[03:10:53.020 --> 03:11:03.611]  Well, what they do is they do, with crop circles, with other JFK events, they do specific little scientific tests.
[03:11:04.272 --> 03:11:09.758]  And then they say, case closed, Oswald alone, you know, shot him from behind.
[03:11:09.758 --> 03:11:12.762]  So, I mean, I'm not saying you're bad for doing the interview.
[03:11:12.762 --> 03:11:13.442]  I'm glad you did it.
[03:11:13.442 --> 03:11:14.944]  I'm just saying, look out.
[03:11:14.944 --> 03:11:17.086]  I also kept asking him, what do you want to interview me about?
[03:11:17.086 --> 03:11:18.348]  Send me questions.
[03:11:18.348 --> 03:11:19.910]  And they wouldn't give me the questions.
[03:11:20.810 --> 03:11:33.741]  So that's the main reason, but let's get into the latest BBC piece with David Ray Griffin, and then Professor Jones, come in with your own points on the science, as a physicist, dealing with this.
[03:11:33.741 --> 03:11:42.448]  Professor Griffin, breaking down the latest BBC piece, saying, we solved Building 7, and this is why it happened.
[03:11:42.448 --> 03:11:45.050]  Break that down for folks, the distortions.
[03:11:46.792 --> 03:12:06.962]  Well, partly they're basing it on what they assumed NIST was going to say, the report of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which wasn't out yet, but they clearly were talking with them and had a pretty good idea what they were going to say.
[03:12:06.962 --> 03:12:14.226]  And one thing NIST had done was to distort the timeline of Barry Jennings and Michael Hess.
[03:12:14.226 --> 03:12:14.766]  As you know,
[03:12:16.403 --> 03:12:19.384]  And most of your listeners know.
[03:12:19.384 --> 03:12:27.845]  Jennings very clearly said that he and Hess went into the World Trade Center Building 7 very early, right after the first strike.
[03:12:27.845 --> 03:12:30.726]  So they were up there by about 9 o'clock.
[03:12:30.726 --> 03:12:36.507]  He's certain he was there at 9.03 when the second strike on the South Tower occurred.
[03:12:36.507 --> 03:12:40.987]  And shortly thereafter, they went down the stairs.
[03:12:40.987 --> 03:12:45.008]  The elevator wouldn't work, and Jennings said he was on the BBC show, he said,
[03:12:45.427 --> 03:12:48.029]  He was going a landing at a time.
[03:12:48.029 --> 03:12:50.150]  And they were going down very fast.
[03:12:50.150 --> 03:12:57.035]  So that means they would have gotten down to the sixth floor by about 9, 10 or 9, 15 at the latest.
[03:12:57.035 --> 03:12:58.696]  And there was this huge explosion.
[03:12:58.696 --> 03:13:01.478]  They went back up to the eighth floor, broke a window.
[03:13:01.478 --> 03:13:05.922]  Jennings said, I looked out and both the towers were still standing.
[03:13:05.922 --> 03:13:10.545]  So what the, the NIST said, well, these two guys were in there.
[03:13:11.500 --> 03:13:16.943]  And there was a big event, but it was just the North Tower coming down.
[03:13:16.943 --> 03:13:22.166]  Well, of course, that was 1028, which is over an hour later.
[03:13:22.166 --> 03:13:26.849]  And Hess remained silent, of course, all those years.
[03:13:26.849 --> 03:13:37.095]  And then as soon as Jennings dies, the BBC interviews Hess, and Hess freely does an interview now.
[03:13:37.754 --> 03:13:41.958]  And of course tells this new story and tells the timeline.
[03:13:41.958 --> 03:13:43.700]  And interestingly, of course,
[03:13:49.645 --> 03:14:02.869]  Also on record here, he went on Fox TV, he went on other news channels right after the towers had collapsed, and he's on tape talking about how he quickly got out of the building and then how the towers collapsed.
[03:14:02.869 --> 03:14:10.232]  So clearly on record, BBC and everybody knows that that was a very short time frame, not three hours.
[03:14:10.232 --> 03:14:14.413]  So we're seeing massive deception right there on its face.
[03:14:14.413 --> 03:14:19.075]  We know that Hess was being interviewed a half mile away before noon.
[03:14:20.014 --> 03:14:20.414]  I don't know.
[03:14:43.348 --> 03:14:49.754]  And he says, well, yeah, I thought there was an explosion at the time, but now I realize it was just the North Tower coming down.
[03:14:49.754 --> 03:14:55.959]  Well, the way the program implied it, I mean, they don't state anything in these except the pieces, was that it was the towers falling.
[03:14:55.959 --> 03:14:59.563]  And then they, you know, got them out of the building after the towers had fallen.
[03:14:59.563 --> 03:15:04.887]  I mean, that's the point I'm making is they imply the explosions are the towers falling.
[03:15:04.887 --> 03:15:05.348]  That's right.
[03:15:06.752 --> 03:15:10.674]  Now, Stephen Jones particularly gets into the science itself.
[03:15:10.674 --> 03:15:15.116]  What did you think about the science they were putting out in that piece?
[03:15:15.116 --> 03:15:20.038]  Well, I've been disappointed, you know, at what they did there.
[03:15:20.038 --> 03:15:21.898]  Let me give some background, Alex.
[03:15:21.898 --> 03:15:32.863]  About the time they interviewed me, we were finishing up our 14 points paper, which is published in the Open Civil Engineering Journal, so people can Google on that.
[03:15:33.973 --> 03:15:40.338]  Go to journal of 911studies.com, and it's right at the top, a link to this paper in an established journal.
[03:15:40.338 --> 03:15:51.566]  So, point 11 there, I discussed with the folks from BBC, which has to do with steel recovered from the site of World Trade Center 7.
[03:15:51.566 --> 03:15:54.048]  It just looks like Swiss cheese.
[03:15:54.048 --> 03:16:03.535]  I don't know if you've seen the photos, but it's heavily corroded and shows sulfur inside the steel.
[03:16:04.697 --> 03:16:05.298]  I think so.
[03:16:19.669 --> 03:16:25.733]  Well, hold on one moment.
[03:16:25.733 --> 03:16:29.516]  I'm actually going to skip this break, because this information is too important right now.
[03:16:51.490 --> 03:16:55.431]  So, here's what we did.
[03:16:55.431 --> 03:17:06.114]  FEMA, to their credit, put this data in Appendix C of their report that came out, and then NIST has totally ignored this data on the steel.
[03:17:06.114 --> 03:17:10.136]  In fact, NIST admits they didn't look at any steel from World Trade Center 7 in their report.
[03:17:10.136 --> 03:17:15.117]  Very blatant violation of normal scientific protocol.
[03:17:17.662 --> 03:17:21.644]  They said there was no steel from Building 7.
[03:17:21.644 --> 03:17:22.885]  Very interesting point.
[03:17:22.885 --> 03:17:24.545]  There's a lot of steel there.
[03:17:24.545 --> 03:17:26.426]  I saw the photos of it, but anyway.
[03:17:26.426 --> 03:17:38.472]  Okay, and I know a lot of it was whisked away, but we do know the sample that still exists, because even in touch with the people at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, they have the steel from the Robopower Building 7.
[03:17:38.472 --> 03:17:45.376]  Quite a distance, as you know, from the other two towers, so there's really very little question about it besides markings and so on.
[03:17:46.158 --> 03:17:47.859]  Well, back to the story with BBC.
[03:17:47.859 --> 03:17:58.327]  So I did this experiment with thermate, which is what I call thermite plus sulfur, and I had a piece of steel from the South Tower.
[03:17:58.327 --> 03:18:08.995]  Long story short, I got this small sample of steel, but it was actual steel from the World Trade Center, put this slice of steel in the thermate, touched it off, BBC cameras rolling,
[03:18:10.345 --> 03:18:19.849]  I don't see that they showed any of that, but then we took that steel down to the scanning electron microscope and looked at it, and sure enough, there's sulfur in the steel.
[03:18:19.849 --> 03:18:31.754]  Which is surprising, we've done this experiment before, but you know, I was trying to get the point across that we know how the sulfur and this attack, there's a hole in the steel when you do this with thermate.
[03:18:31.754 --> 03:18:35.176]  And you showed all this to BBC, and they really didn't show a lot of that.
[03:18:35.176 --> 03:18:36.817]  And they didn't show it.
[03:18:36.817 --> 03:18:39.158]  Well, let me tell you what's going to happen when this other guy from
[03:18:40.913 --> 03:18:47.818]  I mean, it's a production company, who just did a Discovery Channel piece on JFK, now they're doing the San Francisco Geographic.
[03:18:47.818 --> 03:18:51.220]  What he does is he hires a bunch of former cops.
[03:18:51.220 --> 03:18:53.622]  We know about these cop crime labs.
[03:18:53.622 --> 03:18:55.203]  Oh boy, are they reliable.
[03:18:55.203 --> 03:18:57.245]  Give me a break.
[03:18:57.245 --> 03:18:59.046]  Beelzebub's more accurate.
[03:18:59.046 --> 03:19:06.171]  And then they have them, and they're going to come out and show, knowing that the general public's not going to go out and do your thermate test, and it's going to be kind of like
[03:19:07.352 --> 03:19:08.632]  Yeah, I know what you mean Alex.
[03:19:08.632 --> 03:19:14.354]  I'm just saying that I think it's worthwhile to take a shot at trying to get some facts out there to the public.
[03:19:14.354 --> 03:19:16.855]  Even some of those slipped through in the BBC effort.
[03:19:16.855 --> 03:19:17.755]  So, I'm hopeful with this.
[03:19:35.461 --> 03:19:36.422]  Hello, Robert.
[03:19:36.422 --> 03:19:40.364]  And if I may, his questions were fair.
[03:19:40.364 --> 03:19:45.888]  There's one question that he asked that I thought was a little off, and so I didn't go there, but I'll explain why.
[03:19:45.888 --> 03:19:53.814]  His question was, well, he's talking to Professor Thomas Eager, which is good in a sense.
[03:19:53.814 --> 03:19:55.775]  I'd like to see, I'd like to talk to Professor Eager.
[03:19:55.775 --> 03:20:00.459]  I'd like to debate the issues publicly with Professor Eager, particularly the 13 points.
[03:20:00.459 --> 03:20:01.259]  But what are they asking?
[03:20:03.735 --> 03:20:05.857]  What did he specifically ask you about, Eager?
[03:20:05.857 --> 03:20:19.627]  Oh, so what he was asking about was, he said, Eager wants me to ask you, how in the world can you get all these explosives into the towers and Building 7 to bring them down?
[03:20:19.627 --> 03:20:22.369]  You know, give me an exact scenario.
[03:20:22.369 --> 03:20:30.256]  And my point was, well look, we have now found residues in the dust that show that
[03:20:31.562 --> 03:20:34.044]  Explosive material.
[03:20:34.044 --> 03:20:35.746]  Hold on, hold on, we're coming back to the full audience.
[03:20:35.746 --> 03:20:41.250]  Hold on, here we go.
[03:20:41.250 --> 03:20:49.297]  Okay, so Professor Jones is talking to the... We're gonna go back to Professor Griffin here in just a moment.
[03:20:49.297 --> 03:20:50.377]  He's talking to the
[03:20:52.031 --> 03:21:01.076]  National Geographic guy, and then a guy saying, this Professor Eager wants to know exactly how many bombs were in the building, and exactly how they wired up 7 and Tower 1 and 2.
[03:21:01.076 --> 03:21:09.201]  Well, he asked me that same question over the phone, and I said, well, Building 7 was a spook building, CIA, FBI, it was the emergency, and he just started laughing at me.
[03:21:09.201 --> 03:21:12.323]  I mean, that's an admitted fact, but it's real funny.
[03:21:12.323 --> 03:21:15.705]  And, you know, same thing with the other buildings, and Professor Jones was saying,
[03:21:16.573 --> 03:21:20.196]  Well, hey, we found the explosives residue.
[03:21:20.196 --> 03:21:22.037]  That's the issue here.
[03:21:22.037 --> 03:21:23.679]  Not how did they commit the whole crime.
[03:21:23.679 --> 03:21:25.460]  We're saying there's evidence of a crime.
[03:21:25.460 --> 03:21:29.083]  That's why we needed a real investigation, not a cover-up.
[03:21:29.083 --> 03:21:31.385]  Professor Jones?
[03:21:31.385 --> 03:21:32.085]  That's right, Alex.
[03:21:32.085 --> 03:21:35.588]  And that's what I explained to him on tape.
[03:21:35.588 --> 03:21:38.270]  So I didn't give him an exact scenario.
[03:21:38.270 --> 03:21:43.414]  What I said was there's a lot we can learn from the hard physical evidence from the 9-11 deaths.
[03:21:45.126 --> 03:21:58.929]  And these residues that we're looking for, the NFPA 921, the National Fire Code, requires a scene of a fire where there's a crime, which certainly applies to 9-11.
[03:21:58.929 --> 03:22:12.192]  But then the next step, just like in CSI, the scientists do their work, but then you have other investigators with subpoena power, for instance, in a trial setting, so that you can ask questions from a lot of people.
[03:22:15.639 --> 03:22:26.367]  Well, you've now gotten peer-reviewed journals on this, and I want to talk about that more, but going back to David Ray Griffin, who by the way has written what, now seven books on 9-11, is that correct, Professor?
[03:22:27.285 --> 03:22:27.525]  Uh, yeah.
[03:22:43.977 --> 03:22:48.219]  You know, we've got the Solicitor General's wife.
[03:22:48.219 --> 03:22:52.760]  Now the FBI admits that he made up the phone call.
[03:22:52.760 --> 03:22:53.721]  She didn't call him.
[03:22:53.721 --> 03:23:07.206]  I mean, how are they getting so many people to lie, who've been caught in lies, and how do they get these TV presenters to knowingly go out and lie and say that Barry Jennings was in the building three hours when he was in there 20 minutes?
[03:23:07.206 --> 03:23:09.967]  I mean, how do they find people to do this?
[03:23:12.096 --> 03:23:15.458]  Well, they pay them big salaries.
[03:23:15.458 --> 03:23:38.889]  A lot of my work was in the problem of evil, and this is, of course, a very old story, and it still is shocking, even though I've studied it over the centuries, the really just horrible things people can do, and at the same time be kind of ordinary good family men.
[03:23:38.889 --> 03:23:41.891]  I mean, this was notorious about the Nazis.
[03:23:43.760 --> 03:24:03.435]  In fact, the famous statement called the Banality of Evil, a study of the Nazis, that these were just ordinary family men, but get put in situations where their job depends on it, their career depends on it, their salary depends on it, and so on.
[03:24:03.435 --> 03:24:06.917]  And it is astounding what people will do.
[03:24:06.917 --> 03:24:10.400]  I was very disappointed on the BBC show
[03:24:11.269 --> 03:24:36.017]  They at least dealt with this question of the steel that had been turned into Swiss cheese looking stuff, that they at least mentioned this, but they brought on one or two of those professors at Worcester Polytechnic Institute who had done that study, and you know at the time they said, well, they had no idea where the sulfur came from.
[03:24:38.189 --> 03:24:43.971]  On the BBC show, one of them said, Oh, well, I don't find that surprising.
[03:24:43.971 --> 03:24:48.393]  It could have just kind of mixed in, you know, heating up underground there.
[03:24:48.393 --> 03:25:03.400]  Yeah, they claim steel now corroded in a few weeks in the heat when it's got the, according to Jones and others, you know, the classic burn holes, you know, that happen from something really fast.
[03:25:03.400 --> 03:25:06.501]  Well, that's right, and you'd be talking about extremely
[03:25:07.270 --> 03:25:08.831]  High temperatures.
[03:25:08.831 --> 03:25:15.814]  Stephen, what temperatures would you need to oxidize steel?
[03:25:15.814 --> 03:25:27.680]  Well, of course steel can rust, but the point here is that there are very high temperatures in evidence to reduce that steel beam to the thickness.
[03:25:27.680 --> 03:25:32.923]  It's very thin paper with holes in it, plus the sulfur in the steel.
[03:25:32.923 --> 03:25:34.544]  I talked to a fellow from
[03:25:35.565 --> 03:25:45.372]  WPI saying, well, it could, the operative term there is could, have been something like Wal-Board that could introduce sulfur.
[03:25:45.372 --> 03:25:52.917]  But you see, Wal-Board has calcium and sulfur, and they're very tightly bound with oxygen as well, calcium and sulfur.
[03:25:52.917 --> 03:25:58.200]  So, you know, it's not an issue here, just saying you could do it.
[03:25:58.200 --> 03:25:59.181]  You do experiments.
[03:25:59.181 --> 03:26:00.022]  That's what we do in science.
[03:26:01.555 --> 03:26:15.667]  Alright, we're going to break and come back and talk about that experiment, and then for both of you, both Professor Jones and Professor Griffin, find out where you think they should go from here.
[03:26:15.667 --> 03:26:20.110]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:26:20.110 --> 03:26:24.034]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:26:24.034 --> 03:26:26.736]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:26:30.296 --> 03:26:33.821]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:26:33.821 --> 03:26:39.228]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:26:39.228 --> 03:26:43.914]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:26:45.196 --> 03:26:55.899]  KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[03:26:55.899 --> 03:27:01.661]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or one year, whichever comes first.
[03:27:01.661 --> 03:27:07.923]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[03:27:07.923 --> 03:27:08.963]  What about you?

[03:27:29.838 --> 03:27:36.604]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:27:36.604 --> 03:27:38.246]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:27:39.398 --> 03:27:40.759]  Who is the enemy?
[03:27:40.759 --> 03:27:41.559]  Bin Laden.
[03:27:41.559 --> 03:27:42.580]  This is his ammo.
[03:27:42.580 --> 03:27:43.900]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:27:43.900 --> 03:27:45.921]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:27:45.921 --> 03:27:53.065]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:27:53.065 --> 03:27:53.545]  Some U.S.
[03:27:53.545 --> 03:27:59.188]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:27:59.908 --> 03:28:03.411]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:28:03.411 --> 03:28:05.393]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:28:30.387 --> 03:28:36.191]  If a low credit score is keeping you from getting the car, home, business loan, or credit cards you deserve, this message is for you.
[03:29:00.267 --> 03:29:02.008]  This message has been brought to you by RadioCreditSecrets.com
[03:29:35.765 --> 03:29:49.199]  You know, in the 25 minutes or so of airtime we have left with both of you gentlemen today, I'd like for you both just to have a discussion and cover the issues that you think are most important.
[03:29:49.199 --> 03:29:54.144]  And we can go back over the science of Building 7 or Tower 1 or 2.
[03:29:54.144 --> 03:29:55.826]  That's only a small part of it.
[03:29:55.826 --> 03:29:58.048]  You take all the evidence together, that's what's really strong.
[03:29:59.301 --> 03:30:06.127]  It's just seeing the other side, how they always lie, they always distort, they always twist, knowingly.
[03:30:06.127 --> 03:30:15.835]  And I go back to what I was saying to David Ray Griffin, who's a top theologian, amongst other things, is, yeah, the nature of evil.
[03:30:15.835 --> 03:30:17.917]  I mean, do they rationalize to themselves?
[03:30:17.917 --> 03:30:19.118]  I think some of them do that, but others
[03:30:19.909 --> 03:30:21.609]  You know, it's funny to them.
[03:30:21.609 --> 03:30:34.092]  I guess they get a thrill by working with the evil, by being patted on the head by the system.
[03:30:34.092 --> 03:30:36.533]  David Ray Griffin?
[03:30:36.533 --> 03:30:39.874]  Well you know, it's hard to know in all cases.
[03:30:39.874 --> 03:30:45.295]  I think some of it is what Sinclair Lewis pointed out long ago.
[03:30:46.334 --> 03:30:53.460]  That it's hard to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.
[03:30:53.460 --> 03:31:06.851]  So I think in some cases, the people in the news media, uh, you know, they have blinders on and they just look selectively at the evidence that seems to support the official story.
[03:31:06.851 --> 03:31:13.617]  And so they recognize, well, if they twist a little bit here and there, they're, they're doing it for a larger truth.
[03:31:13.617 --> 03:31:14.718]  They can rationalize.
[03:31:15.666 --> 03:31:18.891]  I think there's a lot of self-delusion that allows people to live with themselves.
[03:31:32.927 --> 03:31:34.570]  Absolutely.
[03:31:34.570 --> 03:31:42.844]  Steven Jones, I know you're a physicist, so you stick mainly to the science, but dealing with these people, I mean, your evidence, your research is conclusive.
[03:31:42.844 --> 03:31:45.548]  It fits in with other research and eyewitness reports.
[03:31:47.563 --> 03:31:49.645]  They're fitting square pegs and round holes.
[03:31:49.645 --> 03:31:55.450]  We're fitting round, you know, pegs and round holes.
[03:31:55.450 --> 03:31:57.832]  I mean, what has this whole journey been like for you?
[03:31:57.832 --> 03:32:00.274]  And where do you see 9-11 Truth going now?
[03:32:00.274 --> 03:32:02.816]  And then I'll ask that same question to Griffin.
[03:32:02.816 --> 03:32:07.280]  Now that Obama's coming in, some are saying, oh my gosh, they think everything's fine okay now.
[03:32:07.280 --> 03:32:08.661]  They're going to sleep.
[03:32:08.661 --> 03:32:14.746]  Not understanding the very same military-industrial complex that clearly staged the attacks is still in control.
[03:32:16.702 --> 03:32:22.507]  Let me respond to that particular issue of where the 9-11 Truth Movement is going, Alex.
[03:32:22.507 --> 03:32:24.169]  I'm actually quite encouraged.
[03:32:24.169 --> 03:32:34.398]  See, the flip side to those, basically, official people missed, for example, that keep evading many of our questions.
[03:32:34.398 --> 03:32:40.904]  Anyway, we could discuss that further, but I want to mention the people that are
[03:32:41.954 --> 03:32:43.055]  Helping us.
[03:32:43.055 --> 03:32:51.820]  And these are, there's really a very large, as you know, and you're a big part of it, this large public movement to get at the 9-11 truth.
[03:32:51.820 --> 03:33:03.407]  And in particular, I want to thank those people in New York City who saved World Trade Center deaths, the 9-11 deaths, on that day or shortly thereafter.
[03:33:03.407 --> 03:33:11.592]  We now have four samples that we're looking at very actively and scrutinizing very carefully.
[03:33:12.421 --> 03:33:17.543]  And, uh, this dust is just revealing so much to us about what really happened that day.
[03:33:17.543 --> 03:33:29.126]  Uh, I have heard reports that the officials that, uh, gathered up the steel and shipped that over to Asia for melting also tried to gather up all the dust, but they did not succeed.
[03:33:29.126 --> 03:33:33.267]  A lot of people saved dust because it came into their apartments.
[03:33:33.267 --> 03:33:41.490]  It invaded their private space and, and to their great credit, these, uh, New Yorkers saved some of that dust, often just for a souvenir.
[03:33:42.600 --> 03:33:49.584]  And we've had a dust-in from Frank Palacios, who gathered a sample ten minutes after the North Tower collapsed.
[03:33:49.584 --> 03:33:59.769]  That dust is full of these red chips, red on one side, gray on the other, that are very actively being studied now by three labs.
[03:33:59.769 --> 03:34:03.410]  And there are other labs anxious to study this material.
[03:34:03.410 --> 03:34:09.413]  And the reason I mention this, I had an email from David here just before your program.
[03:34:09.413 --> 03:34:10.554]  We would like to encourage
[03:34:11.363 --> 03:34:12.024]  I don't know.
[03:34:31.621 --> 03:34:39.906]  The labs now are here in Indiana and New Hampshire, and we want to spread that to France and Australia and so on.
[03:34:39.906 --> 03:34:46.950]  There are people in France just very anxious to get their hands on a small 9-11 dust sample.
[03:34:46.950 --> 03:34:47.210]  Sure.
[03:34:47.210 --> 03:34:51.032]  They can look for the microspheres and the red-grey chips.
[03:34:51.032 --> 03:34:55.275]  So, Stephen, would you want them to send it directly to you, or how would they get it to you?
[03:34:56.440 --> 03:35:02.362]  Okay, I wouldn't want it to come directly to me, then we have problems with chain of custody.
[03:35:02.362 --> 03:35:08.624]  But if they want to write to me, or... That you could give them the address where to send it.
[03:35:08.624 --> 03:35:10.525]  I can give them the address, right.
[03:35:10.525 --> 03:35:15.767]  Professor Barbarian in France needs a sample desperately, for example.
[03:35:16.585 --> 03:35:19.267]  And we're trying to get that over to him.
[03:35:19.267 --> 03:35:24.631]  It needs to be, a sample needs to be about what would fit in your hand, you know, a cup-shaped hand.
[03:35:24.631 --> 03:35:26.172]  Well, how do folks get in contact with you?
[03:35:26.172 --> 03:35:26.793]  Through the journal?
[03:35:26.793 --> 03:35:44.226]  Yeah, if they go to the journal of 911studies.com, and then up at the top click on Contact Us, they can write to either Kevin, or either of the three editors, Kevin Ryan, Frank Legge, a PhD chemist in Australia, or myself.
[03:35:45.021 --> 03:35:47.464]  I'm in contact with the same people in France, so I can give you the address too.
[03:36:04.661 --> 03:36:05.901]  Well, that is the good news.
[03:36:05.901 --> 03:36:10.062]  We also have Russian TV, French, Spanish, Japanese.
[03:36:10.062 --> 03:36:18.965]  I mean, they're all doing real reports that are showing, wow, there really is evidence of inside job.
[03:36:18.965 --> 03:36:24.627]  David Ray Griffin, looking at this historically, which you also look at, how do you see it unfolding now?
[03:36:24.627 --> 03:36:25.487]  Because at one level,
[03:36:26.347 --> 03:36:29.609]  I do see it losing some wind in the sails with Obama.
[03:36:29.609 --> 03:36:35.391]  But at another level, it's already gone international and actually seems to be building despite that.
[03:36:35.391 --> 03:36:40.153]  And, you know, false flag terrorism has now entered the nomenclature.
[03:36:40.153 --> 03:36:42.294]  It's in movies, it's in culture.
[03:36:42.294 --> 03:36:43.755]  People are now looking for it.
[03:36:43.755 --> 03:36:49.897]  So it seems that the tool of government of false flag or corporations has been damaged to a certain extent.
[03:36:49.897 --> 03:36:51.918]  And some people say to me, well, why do you care?
[03:36:51.918 --> 03:36:52.759]  That was seven years ago.
[03:36:52.759 --> 03:36:53.379]  The whole point is
[03:36:53.999 --> 03:37:00.944]  The entire post 9-11 world, this whole surveillance grid, has been built on that lie.
[03:37:00.944 --> 03:37:09.809]  So can you overall speak to the 9-11 truth saga itself and where you see it, what it's done and where you see it going?
[03:37:09.809 --> 03:37:11.571]  Yes, let me make three points.
[03:37:11.571 --> 03:37:21.097]  One is, I think the election of Obama is a reason to gear up, not to slow down.
[03:37:21.693 --> 03:37:32.717]  Because, you know, although we all tried, there was no realistic chance, as long as Bush was in power, that anything was going to happen in the United States.
[03:37:32.717 --> 03:37:40.999]  But with a new administration, a new Attorney General, and so on, there is really a chance that we could have an investigation.
[03:37:40.999 --> 03:37:43.340]  Now, some people were motivated by revenge.
[03:37:43.340 --> 03:37:47.942]  They wanted Bush and Cheney and the gang to be punished, and that's understandable.
[03:37:47.942 --> 03:37:49.282]  But that's not the main thing.
[03:37:50.104 --> 03:37:54.169]  The main thing is to get the policies changed, as you've indicated.
[03:37:54.169 --> 03:37:58.273]  The so-called war on terror is set to continue.
[03:37:58.273 --> 03:38:04.060]  Obama thus far has talked about increasing our activities in Afghanistan.
[03:38:04.898 --> 03:38:12.984]  And they're still talking as if they believe that Osama Bin Laden is still alive, even though there's no evidence that he's been alive.
[03:38:12.984 --> 03:38:14.906]  In fact, it appears they're reviving him!
[03:38:14.906 --> 03:38:23.693]  Yeah, he's... I'm just writing a paper on that, and the evidence is very strong.
[03:38:24.366 --> 03:38:31.368]  The evidence that he's been alive since 2001 is really extremely weak to non-existent.
[03:38:31.368 --> 03:38:37.050]  So that's one point, that we should be increasing our activity, not decreasing it.
[03:38:37.050 --> 03:38:46.354]  Secondly, on this internationalization, I just returned from a tour in Japan, and there is increasing interest there.
[03:38:46.354 --> 03:38:51.715]  We had almost 500 people turn out in Tokyo for an all-day conference.
[03:38:54.751 --> 03:39:01.613]  And then we have political leaders in Tokyo who have taken a public stand.
[03:39:01.613 --> 03:39:04.213]  And of course, that adds credibility.
[03:39:04.213 --> 03:39:16.816]  And I've been working with Fujita and another person to bring about a group called Political Leaders for 9-11 Truth, which will be an international movement.
[03:39:16.816 --> 03:39:21.377]  We already, in fact, have a website, although if you go there, there's nothing on it there.
[03:39:21.377 --> 03:39:22.977]  But we're all ready to fill in the
[03:39:23.649 --> 03:39:24.309]  The data.
[03:39:24.309 --> 03:39:27.030]  So that'll be a significant event.
[03:39:27.030 --> 03:39:31.392]  And thirdly... Hello, are you still there?
[03:39:31.392 --> 03:39:32.513]  Yes, we're here.
[03:39:32.513 --> 03:39:41.537]  Okay, I just... Thirdly, a new group has just formed called Lawyers for 9-11 Truth, which is an international group.
[03:39:41.537 --> 03:39:48.920]  And William Pepper and many other leading lawyers have already signed up, and it's moving along rather quickly.
[03:39:50.817 --> 03:40:10.026]  The point is that, whereas Stephen and Kevin and others have led the way to get us to this point where the science is so strong, that it's now time to turn it over to the political and legal realm, and that is now starting to happen.
[03:40:10.026 --> 03:40:11.687]  Alright, well let's look forward.
[03:40:11.687 --> 03:40:14.068]  First you, Professor Rivlin, quickly get a
[03:40:17.461 --> 03:40:19.662]  response from Professor Jones.
[03:40:19.662 --> 03:40:21.543]  How do you see it unfolding in the future?
[03:40:21.543 --> 03:40:23.184]  Because it is continuing to grow.
[03:40:23.184 --> 03:40:29.547]  People understand how core an issue it is of government-sponsored terror, of provocateur actions.
[03:40:29.547 --> 03:40:30.868]  How do you see it unfolding?
[03:40:30.868 --> 03:40:33.389]  Do you see any justice to the perpetrators?
[03:40:33.389 --> 03:40:45.456]  Or do you just see it becoming a public secret that this has been done, thus deterring some of the same institutions from pulling off similar events in the future?
[03:40:46.374 --> 03:40:49.955]  Well, I would prefer a third alternative.
[03:40:49.955 --> 03:40:57.516]  As I say, I'm not interested in and resent, and I'm rather encouraged by Obama.
[03:40:57.516 --> 03:41:00.077]  I know some people aren't, but I am.
[03:41:00.077 --> 03:41:06.538]  First of all, he is very bright, and secondly, I believe he has also got a strong moral compass.
[03:41:06.538 --> 03:41:12.699]  And he also appreciates constitutional law, and he knows what has been done here.
[03:41:14.085 --> 03:41:20.911]  And so I think that he will be open to, he and his people will be open to evidence.
[03:41:20.911 --> 03:41:34.561]  So that's why I say I think we need to ramp things up and present the strongest evidence and take every route we can to get it, bring it to the attention of the Obama people.
[03:41:34.561 --> 03:41:42.788]  Because I think there is the chance for real investigation, but also he has shown that he has this
[03:41:43.903 --> 03:41:51.604]  Virtue called forgiveness that, you know, at least in our Christian tradition, has been called a virtue.
[03:41:51.604 --> 03:41:55.525]  And he's willing to let bygones be bygones.
[03:41:55.525 --> 03:42:08.547]  And so I think if the most hopeful route would be a truth and reconciliation commission, where the main thing would be to get the truth out and therefore get the policies changed.
[03:42:08.547 --> 03:42:11.928]  And if these people, you know, they'll have their own punishment.
[03:42:14.223 --> 03:42:22.767]  You know, just knowing what they did and having people know what they did, that's a very secondary or tertiary matter from my point of view.
[03:42:22.767 --> 03:42:24.688]  Professor Jones?
[03:42:24.688 --> 03:42:26.889]  Yeah.
[03:42:26.889 --> 03:42:40.855]  I guess mine would be almost a fourth alternative, or maybe a modification of a couple others, and that is, I think, from the people, ourselves, internationally now, as it's clear that there's an awakening going on.
[03:42:41.627 --> 03:42:56.231]  I think that there can be this grassroots movement, coupled, frankly, with economic difficulties that are making people say, well, wait a minute, maybe I shouldn't trust the government and everything, you know?
[03:42:56.231 --> 03:43:08.735]  I mean, the depression or recession, whatever you want to call it, that seems to be spreading internationally is inducing people to take a hard look at what has brought us to this state.
[03:43:08.735 --> 03:43:09.635]  And as that happens,
[03:43:10.197 --> 03:43:17.281]  Through the internet and programs like yours, Alex, the truth about 9-11, I believe, will resonate with more people.
[03:43:17.281 --> 03:43:22.584]  We'll have this grassroots movement demanding answers.
[03:43:22.584 --> 03:43:32.309]  And I think that, coupled with the science, will force politicians, even in our own Congress, to say, look, we need to take a look at this.
[03:43:32.309 --> 03:43:37.172]  I might say that our Congressman, my Congressman, here in Utah,
[03:43:38.117 --> 03:43:46.258]  Came over to my little apartment and spent an hour with me, one-on-one, discussing 9-11 issues and the research that I'd done.
[03:43:46.258 --> 03:43:50.159]  And he is very supportive of a 9-11 investigation.
[03:43:50.159 --> 03:43:54.540]  Jason Chaffetz, just newly elected, replaced Chris Cannon.
[03:43:54.540 --> 03:43:58.481]  Wow, Jason Chaffetz.
[03:43:58.481 --> 03:43:59.781]  Chaffetz, right.
[03:43:59.781 --> 03:44:06.902]  So, you know, I'm very encouraged that, and I know there are a lot of people locally and internationally,
[03:44:09.087 --> 03:44:11.427]  Is that a federal congressman?
[03:44:11.427 --> 03:44:12.448]  Yes.
[03:44:12.448 --> 03:44:15.148]  How do you spell his name, Jason Chaffetz?
[03:44:15.148 --> 03:44:18.870]  Chaffetz, C-H-A-F-F-E-T-Z.
[03:44:18.870 --> 03:44:22.351]  Alright, I want to get him on.
[03:44:22.351 --> 03:44:23.851]  Well, okay.
[03:44:23.851 --> 03:44:29.833]  He's new into the Congress, his first round in Congress.
[03:44:29.833 --> 03:44:32.214]  So he is a 9-11 truther, or he's investigating?
[03:44:33.334 --> 03:44:38.756]  I was, he supports an investigation and he wanted to talk to me and so we did for an hour in my apartment.
[03:44:38.756 --> 03:44:40.517]  Well that's fabulous.
[03:44:40.517 --> 03:44:43.878]  That is fabulous news.
[03:44:43.878 --> 03:44:48.460]  Okay, in the... The people are... In the ten minutes... The people are... Go ahead.
[03:44:48.460 --> 03:44:58.424]  No, no, no, I mean you were saying that the people are... People are leaning on their congressman to do an investigation.
[03:44:58.424 --> 03:45:02.166]  I'm hoping that is, you know, various conditions
[03:45:03.135 --> 03:45:09.420]  David Ray Griffin, isn't there also a facet to this that the people have learned that when the mainstream media is
[03:45:30.689 --> 03:45:48.055]  Is attacking a 9-11 truth movement or a JFK investigation movement or any other movement that generally the mainstream media is so discredited now that it almost makes people then go investigate what we're saying.
[03:45:48.055 --> 03:45:55.257]  I mean I found as bad as the History Channel piece was that it seemed to backfire on them and got more people to actually look at the evidence.
[03:45:57.284 --> 03:46:03.528]  Well, yeah, and the BBC show had the same effect.
[03:46:03.528 --> 03:46:24.583]  Yeah, and just building on what Stephen was saying there, I think that it will take an international movement, and that's why I'm encouraged that Japan, it looks like now, will be putting pressure on Washington and saying, look, we lost some people in the towers.
[03:46:27.375 --> 03:46:34.019]  We've only had the assurance of President Bush that these were Muslims who did this.
[03:46:34.019 --> 03:46:36.480]  Give us the proof.
[03:46:36.480 --> 03:46:53.891]  I understand from Annie McCollum, she was here recently from the UK, the leader of the London movement, and she says that whereas some people in the United States had said things were dying down a little bit here because the Bush-Cheney people would be leaving office,
[03:46:54.335 --> 03:46:59.138]  That in Europe it's actually getting much more interest.
[03:46:59.138 --> 03:47:04.642]  Well, let me say, it's only getting bigger from what I see in New York this last year and other places.
[03:47:04.642 --> 03:47:13.129]  I'm just seeing some fear that, you know, it's a Bush-centric, all about Bush, whereas the very same military industrial complex that did this
[03:47:13.989 --> 03:47:15.331]  Uh, is still there.
[03:47:15.331 --> 03:47:20.096]  And I think that's the point that has to be made, but we'll see what Barack Obama does.
[03:47:20.096 --> 03:47:27.323]  I mean, I have to tell you, appointing Hillary Clinton, or moving to put her in Secretary of State, and a bunch of other stuff, I think we're going to see betrayal from him.
[03:47:27.323 --> 03:47:28.485]  But, we can hope for the best.
[03:47:28.485 --> 03:47:29.626]  Final segment with Everett Ray Griffin.
[03:47:30.430 --> 03:47:32.411]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:47:32.411 --> 03:47:39.375]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[03:47:39.375 --> 03:47:47.780]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:47:47.780 --> 03:47:53.503]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:47:53.683 --> 03:47:55.525]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:47:55.525 --> 03:47:57.707]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:47:57.707 --> 03:48:02.252]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:48:02.252 --> 03:48:04.474]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[03:48:31.777 --> 03:48:35.060]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[03:48:35.100 --> 03:48:35.641]  I don't know.

[03:49:29.941 --> 03:49:31.622]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[03:49:31.622 --> 03:49:33.363]  What does humidity mean to you?
[03:49:33.363 --> 03:49:36.044]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[03:49:36.044 --> 03:49:41.187]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[03:49:41.187 --> 03:49:44.368]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[03:50:32.952 --> 03:50:44.417]  Alright, final segments with Professor Stephen Jones, who I want to get back on separately, by himself and Edward Griffin, by himself in the near future, but I thought it would be neat to have both of them on together today.
[03:50:44.417 --> 03:50:46.558]  And we appreciate them joining us.
[03:50:46.558 --> 03:50:57.684]  Before I go back to them, PrisonPlanet.tv, all of my films are super high quality, the last hour of the show, every day, live, with the document cam, the video feeds, extras from films that aren't even on the DVDs,

[03:51:32.221 --> 03:51:36.924]  I know you know about the New World Order, but your friends and family, you can actually give them your passcode as a present.
[03:51:36.924 --> 03:51:37.464]  I don't care.
[03:51:37.464 --> 03:51:38.405]  Use it for yourself.
[03:51:38.405 --> 03:51:39.086]  Give it to them.
[03:51:39.086 --> 03:51:40.627]  I want to get the word out.
[03:51:40.627 --> 03:51:43.048]  So that's my little present to you.
[03:51:43.048 --> 03:51:43.368]  Also,
[03:51:44.309 --> 03:51:46.090]  You're going to David Ray Griffin.
[03:51:46.090 --> 03:51:52.931]  Tell us about your latest book, your seventh book on 9-11.
[03:51:52.931 --> 03:52:02.714]  Well, that's the New Pearl Harbor Revisited, and some people have thought it's an update or a revision of the New Pearl Harbor, but not at all.
[03:52:02.714 --> 03:52:04.515]  It's a totally new book.
[03:52:04.515 --> 03:52:12.337]  The idea is that if a journalist or a politician were going to try to dig into this who knew nothing about it before,
[03:52:13.588 --> 03:52:21.695]  It's kind of overwhelming to think, you know, they might have to read 20 journal articles and three or seven books or so.
[03:52:21.695 --> 03:52:26.379]  So the idea was to try to get all the most essential information in two books.
[03:52:26.379 --> 03:52:32.184]  So it's now a two-volume set, The New Pearl Harbor and The New Pearl Harbor Revisited.
[03:52:32.184 --> 03:52:39.990]  And by the way, when you read these books, or you go over the 500 smoking guns of 9-11 online, it is mind-blowing.
[03:52:39.990 --> 03:52:42.072]  I mean, just how obvious it is, David.
[03:52:43.117 --> 03:52:56.359]  Well that's right, and I've always argued the main thing is a cumulative case that no matter which part of the story you look at, you find outright contradictions and lies.
[03:52:57.092 --> 03:53:02.834]  And just assertions that, from a scientific point of view, cannot be true.
[03:53:02.834 --> 03:53:04.435]  Well, that's it.
[03:53:04.435 --> 03:53:05.515]  It's the covering up.
[03:53:05.515 --> 03:53:08.116]  I mean, the other evidence is strong, too.
[03:53:08.116 --> 03:53:15.038]  But the covering up, the sneakiness, the lying, the acting so suspicious, I mean, that is really powerful.
[03:53:15.038 --> 03:53:18.139]  And in closing, Stephen Jones, your take on that.
[03:53:18.139 --> 03:53:23.041]  I mean, is that strong evidence, the way they lie and cover up?
[03:53:23.041 --> 03:53:23.441]  Well, sure.
[03:53:23.996 --> 03:53:40.840]  And of course, the steel was cut up and shipped out of this country over the protests of many scientists and engineers who felt that this data, this evidence, was crucial in solving and understanding what happened on 9-11.
[03:53:40.840 --> 03:53:52.342]  So, and again, now the dust we have is still extant, and I just wanted to re-emphasize, as I'm working with David and others, Kevin Ryan and others,
[03:53:53.103 --> 03:54:05.307]  Trying to understand and get samples of this 9-11 dust out to scientists worldwide so that we can really corroborate and confirm the results that we're getting.
[03:54:05.307 --> 03:54:06.608]  The findings?
[03:54:06.608 --> 03:54:09.089]  Yeah, the residues of explosives.
[03:54:09.089 --> 03:54:12.650]  So that people can hear about it from scientists.
[03:54:12.650 --> 03:54:20.213]  I believe that there's a lot of trust still in scientists as opposed to politicians, I guess I could say it that way.
[03:54:20.934 --> 03:54:30.646]  And I believe if we can get this out to the public and keep that public discussion going based on hard evidence, it will make tremendous strides in the next year.
[03:54:30.646 --> 03:54:34.130]  Absolutely, and folks can get in contact and read your papers.
[03:54:34.130 --> 03:54:35.132]  Tell them the best place for that.
[03:54:36.551 --> 03:54:46.457]  Just go to journalof911studies.com, and our other papers that are published in the more established journals are listed right up at the top on the home page.
[03:54:46.457 --> 03:54:52.800]  Alright, and then of course for David Ray Griffin's book and other materials, you can just Google David Ray Griffin, The New Pearl Harbor Revisited.
[03:54:52.800 --> 03:54:57.763]  Gentlemen, I want to thank you both for joining us today, and have a great Thanksgiving coming up next week.
[03:54:58.592 --> 03:54:59.592]  Thanks so much.
[03:54:59.592 --> 03:55:00.793]  My pleasure, Alex.
[03:55:00.793 --> 03:55:01.633]  Thank you both, gentlemen.
