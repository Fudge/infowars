[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:27.400]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones we've got a well-known sports
[00:27.400 --> 00:34.160]  writer joining us in about two hours who just got involved in mainline politics and was
[00:34.160 --> 00:39.480]  tracked and traced by Homeland Security the state police want to give you an idea of just
[00:39.480 --> 00:48.480]  how rogue just how classically out of control wicked the government is today with the gas
[00:48.480 --> 00:54.600]  we'll tell you about him a little bit later also we have professor Stephen Jones of physics
[00:54.600 --> 01:00.080]  joining us along with David Ray Griffin together thought that'd be interesting to have the two
[01:00.080 --> 01:07.800]  on together coming up in the fourth hour today I was originally going to have them both on because
[01:07.800 --> 01:17.880]  I was going to have a TV channel here the folks from National Geographic but I decided not to do
[01:17.880 --> 01:23.720]  it because I've learned the type of programs the producers made are just so unsighted there's no
[01:23.720 --> 01:29.680]  point I'd even be part of it so up because they're being interviewed as well and so I thought it
[01:29.680 --> 01:33.760]  would be a nice tie-in but we're not doing that I think they're still being interviewed by them
[01:33.760 --> 01:43.160]  but they are coming up in the fourth hour today a lot of important news will be covering in the
[01:43.160 --> 01:49.240]  meantime and open phones the toll-free number to join us on air on any issue you wish to discuss
[01:49.240 --> 02:00.360]  any news item the economy Barack Hussein Obama the way he is well saying that it's official
[02:00.360 --> 02:07.400]  they're gonna have Hillary Clinton as the Secretary of State Bush Clinton Bush Clinton on and on
[02:07.400 --> 02:17.320]  forever and he's appointing again now all these other new world order insiders so things are
[02:17.320 --> 02:23.760]  going to get even worse if you didn't think that was possible hold on to your seat because it is
[02:23.760 --> 02:31.280]  gonna get more serious I'm actually a lot of Obama minions who were hoping for something new
[02:31.280 --> 02:37.800]  who hated Bush so much and didn't realize that he was a total puppet and didn't realize that Obama
[02:37.800 --> 02:44.240]  would be a puppet I am getting emails and calls and quite a few comments on the message board
[02:44.240 --> 02:50.040]  up on prisonplanet.com as well as in the stories on info wars.com prisonplanet.com people saying
[02:50.040 --> 02:59.680]  yeah you were right my gosh he really has completely betrayed the people well of course I mean he
[02:59.680 --> 03:04.720]  said nine ten months ago he was against the war now he's saying we'll be there at least three more
[03:04.720 --> 03:11.000]  years that's the Bush doctrine a warrantless wiretapping of the American people that continues
[03:11.000 --> 03:18.040]  torture all the policies except a few new ones that that Bush did sign on to in the last two
[03:18.040 --> 03:24.440]  years carbon taxes are regulating every fastener of your life more gun control more amnesty more
[03:24.440 --> 03:32.120]  open borders more taxes now at this point I mean I'm not for raising taxes to quote pay down the
[03:32.120 --> 03:38.000]  deficit because there's no putting Humpty Dumpty back together again the currency will be devalued
[03:38.000 --> 03:45.720]  there is no putting the dollar back together again taxes are only to squeeze the economy into
[03:45.720 --> 03:52.400]  oblivion that much faster so it can be vertically integrated consolidated by the multinational banks
[03:52.400 --> 03:59.920]  so taxes are only used as a weapon when you have an economy this irrevocably bankrupt and
[03:59.920 --> 04:06.880]  unsavageable to brutalize the middle class and by middle class I mean people making a hundred
[04:06.880 --> 04:13.760]  thousand dollars a year up to fifty million a year that is the lower middle class up to the
[04:13.760 --> 04:20.240]  new moreish I know the poor blue collar folks have been taught by Hollywood and TV that somebody
[04:20.240 --> 04:27.920]  making eighty grand a year is rich that is not the case these are economies of scale I mean
[04:27.920 --> 04:33.760]  there are thousands of billionaires ladies and gentlemen they're just good at hiding their
[04:33.760 --> 04:42.000]  assets there are just untold masses of millionaires and it ain't what it used to be as they say so
[04:42.000 --> 04:48.880]  I want to take a lot of calls today at 1-800-25 at 99231 got a lot of interesting news some of it
[04:48.880 --> 04:57.040]  is very encouraging we will talk about it all on the other side it's amazing medical breakthrough
[04:57.040 --> 05:03.720]  stay with us hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's
[05:03.720 --> 05:08.040]  important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent
[05:08.040 --> 05:12.840]  and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a red line if you have your own bread
[05:12.840 --> 05:17.080]  you'll never have to go to the super dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any
[05:17.080 --> 05:21.640]  emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[05:21.640 --> 05:26.200]  with a special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and
[05:26.200 --> 05:31.160]  email they voted to print eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air this money
[05:31.160 --> 05:35.880]  now owns the american and european banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed
[05:35.880 --> 05:41.160]  will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of the sessions particularly food beyond
[05:41.160 --> 05:46.360]  many americans reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled
[05:46.360 --> 05:52.040]  every two days until it reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there
[05:52.040 --> 05:57.000]  seems as if there may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing
[05:57.000 --> 06:01.640]  to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jacka
[06:01.640 --> 06:06.360]  prices to stay in business whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready
[06:06.360 --> 06:10.680]  everything is zeroing in on food one third of americans have to choose between buying food
[06:10.680 --> 06:15.720]  and paying for other necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient
[06:15.720 --> 06:19.800]  get food for everybody out there listening it's very important for you to understand that by having
[06:19.800 --> 06:24.200]  a supply of storable food the government the new old order has a lot less control over you and so
[06:24.200 --> 06:28.840]  it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take care
[06:28.840 --> 06:33.400]  of your family in the final equation but you you know e-foodsdirect.com is still able to ship

[09:10.920 --> 09:17.800]  bank told cnbc any moment now i think we're going to break lower elliot told europe tonight i think
[09:17.800 --> 09:23.000]  this uh is to be possible before the end of november or very early december i mean we're
[09:23.000 --> 09:30.840]  almost on our way now and it's just a question of how far down do we go she said in other financial
[09:30.840 --> 09:37.560]  news i uh watched clebs last night of the multi uh was a three or four hour testimony of henry
[09:37.560 --> 09:44.280]  paulson the guy running the treasury department the golden sacks crime boss uh and the private fed
[09:44.280 --> 09:52.520]  had been bernacky and he arrogantly chastised congress uh every time uh he would speak or
[09:52.520 --> 10:00.280]  bernacky would speak fox news cnn msnbcc nbc would put him on every time uh ron paul or others on
[10:00.280 --> 10:07.240]  the banking committee in the house would hammer them they would just cut away so you had to go
[10:07.240 --> 10:12.120]  to the c-span website or the c-span channels to watch it it's another example i mean these big
[10:12.120 --> 10:19.480]  banks and brokerage firms they own the controlling stock uh in those tv networks and they're not
[10:19.480 --> 10:26.040]  going to let you know what's going on by the way i've seen scores of news articles as they get the
[10:26.040 --> 10:32.120]  public ready to go after the pension funds and as they prepare the public uh to have their uh 401k
[10:32.120 --> 10:40.840]  is taken and um you know i tell people this on the street i was in a uh restaurant last night
[10:40.840 --> 10:43.560]  there were some nice folks talking to me but some other people were kind of laughing at me
[10:45.160 --> 10:49.400]  and and as i was picking food up at the bar for like 10 minutes you know waiting there
[10:50.120 --> 10:55.160]  and uh i just said well what is it i've said that it hasn't happened well i mean what's funny
[10:56.360 --> 11:00.040]  what's funny about all of this i mean it's not funny
[11:02.840 --> 11:08.520]  and uh having your pension funds taken isn't funny but we're a nation of
[11:08.520 --> 11:14.600]  arrogant know-it-alls and then the uh and the average individual is so arrogant
[11:15.400 --> 11:20.200]  that they can't even imagine bad things happening to them let me tell you it's gonna be that much
[11:20.200 --> 11:25.480]  worse people find out what's been done to them i mean you think people are mad now about five
[11:25.480 --> 11:32.040]  trillion stolen in five weeks by the private banks just imagine but uh watching paulson
[11:32.040 --> 11:41.240]  paulson warns tarp isn't panacea for economies ills and it goes on in bloomberg talk about how he
[11:41.240 --> 11:47.960]  chastised the congress like they were bad truly disgusting obama pushes carbon tax proposal that
[11:47.960 --> 11:52.920]  would inflict a new great depression in big speech out in california last night about how they're
[11:52.920 --> 11:58.440]  gonna bankrupt this and bankrupt that oh that's really gonna help you america let me explain
[11:58.440 --> 12:03.000]  something to people out there who are posting on the prison planet dot com story that paul
[12:03.000 --> 12:09.000]  Watson wrote going you idiots you don't understand the true vision of obama you don't understand
[12:09.000 --> 12:15.240]  how this is going to energize a new green revolution and a new 21st century economy
[12:17.800 --> 12:18.680]  on and on and on
[12:18.680 --> 12:28.120]  them even if they came out with super technologies today getting them to market bringing them to
[12:28.920 --> 12:37.000]  300 million americans that conversion would take conservatively five years
[12:39.000 --> 12:42.680]  and you know we're seeing other technological conversions the death of the newspapers
[12:42.680 --> 12:49.400]  the massive contraction of tv news not just because they're a pack of lying criminals that no one
[12:49.400 --> 12:56.840]  trust but also because people are tuning out they're tuning into the web but we see the
[12:56.840 --> 13:02.280]  establishment moving to block alternative news blogging to regulate tax and control the web so
[13:02.280 --> 13:13.000]  that fight is now shaking up will um we'll see how that unfolds because that shapes up but i digress
[13:13.960 --> 13:17.320]  the point here is have you read the international agreements you know it all
[13:18.360 --> 13:23.640]  have you read what the imf and world bank international make-up settlements the oecd
[13:25.080 --> 13:30.040]  have you read with the club of rome and trilateral commission and cfr are saying this is for
[13:30.040 --> 13:35.000]  i mean we write articles in link to their statements paul watson's done that in this article
[13:35.640 --> 13:41.880]  but do you even read the article no you even read the links no they say it's about destroying the
[13:41.880 --> 13:46.440]  middle class in vertical integration they say it's about freezing growth of the economy and
[13:46.440 --> 13:52.200]  development to control you because if technology continues to expand they are going to lose their
[13:52.200 --> 14:00.680]  monopolies and you are going to have a revolution of technology and energy and information you
[14:00.680 --> 14:06.760]  understand that of this system it will move what's left of our industry about 20 percent of what
[14:06.760 --> 14:12.920]  we have in the 70s the early 70s 20 percent is left that will move to china and india and
[14:12.920 --> 14:19.400]  mexico and the hundred and other 160 plus other countries where there are no carbon caps
[14:19.400 --> 14:26.040]  and there are no discussion of them ever having it you understand the big banks own and control
[14:26.040 --> 14:32.920]  the big slave factories overseas so it's just a cold-blooded mercantile move to shut down
[14:32.920 --> 14:37.720]  industry here in the united states in canada new zealand australia england western europe
[14:38.840 --> 14:45.000]  i mean do you understand that you understand that you understand that you understand that
[14:45.000 --> 14:53.000]  even if you believe carbon dioxide is a deadly poison and that methane is horrible and even
[14:53.000 --> 14:58.200]  all the rest of it you understand that it will only move it to third world nations and that it
[14:58.200 --> 15:05.560]  will boost the amount i mean the level of wanton ignorance but hey you know what go ahead parade
[15:05.560 --> 15:11.400]  around put obama stickers on your car call for this and just enjoy and and ask yourself if you're
[15:11.400 --> 15:16.360]  better in four or five years than you were today but it won't matter a lot of you don't even care
[15:16.360 --> 15:21.240]  of you become homeless you just he'll he'll be on tv telling you he loves you and you know it's
[15:21.240 --> 15:26.840]  sacrifices we've got to make getting everybody ready for this all right i said i go to your
[15:26.840 --> 15:32.760]  calls i'm digressing here just obama pushes carbon tax proposal sec persecutes mark cuban for
[15:32.760 --> 15:38.920]  relationship with loose change i sat on this show yesterday afternoon the end of the show
[15:38.920 --> 15:46.520]  that there was a good chance this was persecution for mark cuban's involvement with loose change
[15:46.520 --> 15:52.040]  final cut the owner of the mavericks the guy that sold a bunch of stuff to yacht who for three billion
[15:52.040 --> 16:00.920]  bucks i'll talk about that later i'm gonna go to some calls first but um the new york times is now
[16:00.920 --> 16:05.960]  saying it looks like that's what it is so now i have to reassess things maybe maybe it isn't
[16:05.960 --> 16:11.320]  for you know the new york times is agreeing with me then it must not be true uh but um
[16:13.960 --> 16:20.360]  they do point out though well if you read the article the investigation started the month
[16:22.440 --> 16:27.640]  after bill o'reilly and uh shon hand and others said we're gonna get you cuban we're gonna get
[16:27.640 --> 16:33.240]  you sheen we're gonna ruin you you better not do this and i know that charlie sheen was threatened
[16:33.240 --> 16:36.840]  in ways if i told you you wouldn't even believe it but you saw was put out in the media that was
[16:36.840 --> 16:43.080]  only part of it producers separate people in hollywood's were told you're just out of the blue the
[16:43.960 --> 16:49.240]  you know somebody's sister's husband calls up who's a general in the air force and says
[16:49.240 --> 16:54.520]  don't be involved this is a true story uh in in this movie or they will kill your children
[16:55.160 --> 16:59.240]  and then that was before o'reilly heard about it it was even on the news that's when it was secret
[16:59.240 --> 17:04.360]  it so that's why that never happened cuban actually pulled out of it but it doesn't matter
[17:04.920 --> 17:11.320]  uh this um sec lawyer emailed him and said you know here i am i'm gonna report you we're
[17:11.320 --> 17:16.280]  gonna get you and they did get it and so i'm being sarcastic about not believing the new york
[17:16.280 --> 17:23.720]  times thing i think that is what's going on and and you know i i'm committed to be put in prison
[17:23.720 --> 17:28.840]  if they do it i mean i i for for for some trumped up charge i'm committed to go ahead and you
[17:28.840 --> 17:34.280]  know let that happen i'm committed to be killed or set up or demonized or attacked or gunned down
[17:34.280 --> 17:41.080]  i mean i don't want those things to happen but uh i'm in a position that really nobody else in
[17:41.080 --> 17:47.240]  the quote alternative media or patriot movement is i mean i am the the big kahuna and the sad part
[17:47.240 --> 17:53.160]  about all of this is that i mean i i'm doing this truly from altruistic aims i really know this is
[17:53.160 --> 17:57.320]  a very special journey it's like denis kasinich said months ago on the show he said i don't care
[17:57.320 --> 18:01.720]  if they threaten me i don't care what happens to me this is this is now a spiritual thing
[18:03.160 --> 18:07.880]  by the way magically his brother and sister have both died the last four months very interesting
[18:07.880 --> 18:12.520]  um the view they're pretty young they're younger than him magically dying uh but side issue the point
[18:12.520 --> 18:23.320]  is um that um that's why i wish that other people in this movement would spend more time fighting
[18:23.320 --> 18:31.480]  the new world order instead of obsessing about alex jones and my my celebrity that is exponentially
[18:31.480 --> 18:37.640]  growing because it's a liability for me i don't like it but i do also see it as a mark of success
[18:37.640 --> 18:44.040]  and getting the word out but you can understand it's a dangerous thing it's a it's a it's a very
[18:44.040 --> 18:51.560]  dark thing it's not a you know it's a racing on the edge of the abyss running with the devil
[18:51.560 --> 18:59.400]  whatever you want to call it i mean you should realize that all of us are in danger and especially
[18:59.400 --> 19:04.120]  myself and people should really get their heads screwed on straight in and reassess this because
[19:04.120 --> 19:08.840]  you have no idea the type of persecution we go through to bring you this phase one of the
[19:08.840 --> 19:13.400]  insiders plan for a one world government has been initiated with the recent bailout international
[19:13.400 --> 19:18.280]  bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a
[19:18.280 --> 19:23.320]  new world bank to act as saviour but we've only seen the beginning their next engineered crisis
[19:23.320 --> 19:28.200]  will be on a scale never before seen in modern times shortages and empty shelves will spread

[24:05.160 --> 24:11.320]  let's go to your calls zack in main you're on the air thanks for holding yes mr. jones i i just
[24:11.320 --> 24:17.080]  want to say uh it's a great honor to be in the the air with you i'm a regular listen a listener
[24:17.080 --> 24:22.760]  i have been after this past summer i made a decision not to listen to glenn becker rush limbaugh
[24:22.760 --> 24:29.320]  i have a job that allows me to ride on a lawnmower all day and i have my headphones on and i just
[24:29.320 --> 24:34.760]  got sick of listening to the same old garbage and uh so i decided to buy some forbidden fruit and
[24:34.760 --> 24:39.640]  got one of those iPods and i've been listening to podcasts regularly and sharing it with the guys
[24:39.640 --> 24:46.120]  at work i subscribed to your uh present planet tv got some videos sharing it with my family good
[24:46.120 --> 24:52.360]  and uh i'm also i just want to give a shout out and say hi to the nsa anybody else who's listening
[24:52.360 --> 24:57.880]  i know you're listening and we know you're a bunch of criminals i am in the national guard
[24:57.880 --> 25:03.240]  i took an oath to defend the constitution the people of main the people of this country
[25:03.240 --> 25:09.080]  and uh i'm i'm gonna stick to that and uh my weapon is uh first amendment
[25:09.080 --> 25:14.840]  and i will i will continue to speak out against all these injustices and first limits bad that's
[25:14.840 --> 25:20.920]  the one hold on well some of it a lot and wrote that first amendment so i've been modding hey
[25:20.920 --> 25:27.000]  listen since you got a 9-11 show uh coming today uh you know with it steven jones is on the air
[25:27.000 --> 25:31.800]  yes i brought up glenn beckon something to just discuss me that i heard on the air a couple of
[25:31.800 --> 25:38.120]  years ago people people called into it to his show and we're talking about the uh the explosions
[25:38.120 --> 25:43.560]  that they heard before the towers went down and what glenn beck said what an idiot he said that
[25:43.560 --> 25:48.760]  it was it was people jumping from the building sounding like explosions well yeah people did
[25:48.760 --> 25:53.480]  jump from the building but there's a difference between you know a body smack in the pavement
[25:53.480 --> 25:58.760]  which i'm sure from however many stories up it's going to sound pretty loud it's not going to be
[25:58.760 --> 26:03.960]  the sound of an explosion you know like a like a grenade i've heard grenades and it wouldn't be a
[26:03.960 --> 26:08.040]  body well the police are saying get back but they're bringing it down they're bringing it down the
[26:08.040 --> 26:12.600]  owner said they blew it up and then there's all the witnesses and the countdown and the rest of it
[26:12.600 --> 26:18.840]  but the key here is glenn beck will come on the air and say they're setting up a one-world
[26:18.840 --> 26:23.560]  government the bankers are taking over but he does that only after they finally announced it on the
[26:23.560 --> 26:29.800]  news then he will talk about it yeah he will talk about the the uh treaty of the sea in a law the
[26:29.800 --> 26:34.920]  sea treaty yeah or or or or or or the department of peace you know that obama wants to set up
[26:34.920 --> 26:39.560]  that's really a department of disarming the people and actually waging war wars against innocent
[26:39.560 --> 26:44.360]  individuals the department of peace exactly is about disarming you might have half truth
[26:44.360 --> 26:49.560]  uh but uh the people are seeing through the lies more and more i was about to say that what glenn
[26:49.560 --> 26:56.280]  beck does is that he will tell a lot of things that are true but then mix in lies and say we need
[26:56.280 --> 27:01.080]  to go ahead and arrest 911 truthers we need to go ahead and use the military remember he said use
[27:01.080 --> 27:05.720]  the military on 911 truthers and then five six months later came out and said oh my gosh they
[27:05.720 --> 27:10.680]  want to use the military against the american people i can tell you i am a member of the military
[27:10.680 --> 27:17.880]  and i'm not going along with it i'm not i refuse i i stick by will not obey any unlawful orders
[27:17.880 --> 27:24.040]  and we see through the garbage and unfortunately a segue into obama and and global warming and the
[27:24.040 --> 27:31.640]  rest i had a buddy of mine uh you know who's right in with me in the guard on 911 being an inside
[27:31.640 --> 27:36.360]  job he's had another buddy on the air that's a member of a college radio station and said stuff
[27:36.360 --> 27:41.080]  when he can about it but as soon as obama got elected he's like oh man things are going to
[27:41.080 --> 27:45.880]  change things are going to change so i still gotta i gotta work on him and get them to see
[27:45.880 --> 27:50.280]  through the picture completely and uh another thing i'm sorry i don't want to take up all
[27:50.280 --> 27:56.760]  your time your listeners time but i just attended a concert recently at humane an oar concert
[27:56.760 --> 28:05.880]  and the thing about it is it was part of a campus uh our global consciousness core on global warming
[28:05.880 --> 28:10.920]  and they had all the stuff you can buy stickers to offset your carbon footprint and who's getting
[28:10.920 --> 28:15.880]  the money it seems to me that this global warming thing is exactly what you've been preaching on
[28:15.880 --> 28:23.000]  the bailout you know congress is is is drilling cash card and and it's like an indulgence it's
[28:23.000 --> 28:27.160]  like an indulgence you know 500 years ago you'd buy from the catholic church if you're on your
[28:27.160 --> 28:34.440]  wife you'd go you know you know buy some indulgences it's a total fraud and again it's a tax but they
[28:34.440 --> 28:41.320]  train you for taxes first with you voluntarily going out and paying the tax just now that's

[32:29.640 --> 32:38.840]  a big part of the problem we face
[32:41.320 --> 32:45.160]  is that if you study corruption in any society at any time
[32:49.320 --> 32:52.120]  once governments once companies once institutions
[32:52.120 --> 33:02.760]  get a culture of corruption once corruption sets in even the smallest corruption
[33:05.480 --> 33:12.520]  then you accept a little more a little bit more a little bit more until you've got all sorts of
[33:12.520 --> 33:17.240]  criminals you've got people in government that are doing bid rigging and contract scams and
[33:17.240 --> 33:22.680]  all sorts of fraud and double billing you know just classic things but then it becomes you know
[33:22.680 --> 33:29.880]  stealing people's houses being an irs auditor who makes up stuff uh or uh being a federal prosecutor
[33:30.680 --> 33:35.480]  i mean federal courts openly operate where they'll bring in informants that you've never seen
[33:35.480 --> 33:40.840]  never talked to who testified hundreds of trials a year the judge everybody knows it's a lie the
[33:40.840 --> 33:45.800]  jury or like little children from the general public they don't know they'll bring up five six
[33:45.800 --> 33:50.840]  ten fifteen twenty you know fake people never met you they'll just say i swear i saw him
[33:50.840 --> 33:56.760]  dealing cocaine i swear i saw him laundering money that's like crime labs
[33:58.760 --> 34:03.240]  every major crime lab in the country that i've ever looked at i mean i see three or four articles
[34:03.240 --> 34:13.720]  a week about boston and houston and dalis and la and el paso and just i mean any town you can
[34:13.720 --> 34:20.200]  imagine any city of over a hundred thousand people because they so sloppily do it and they'll
[34:20.200 --> 34:24.760]  they'll put thousands of people per town behind bars over the years which is totally made up
[34:24.760 --> 34:29.320]  crime labs made up witnesses that they run into people that end up being able to get witnesses
[34:29.320 --> 34:34.840]  and document it and then because there are still some good cops they'll blow the whistle and then
[34:34.840 --> 34:41.000]  you'll hear okay they framed in one year four thousand plus people in houston and they just
[34:41.000 --> 34:45.720]  falsified all the evidence but that's just what they do and nobody's getting in trouble or
[34:45.720 --> 34:50.360]  oh the fbi crime lab you know we've had a bunch of people that work there including the head of
[34:50.360 --> 34:56.280]  the forensics department come out frederick whitehurst and say that it was industrialized fraud
[34:56.280 --> 35:01.320]  just open fraud not even the hidden they didn't even sneak around about it was just okay let's go
[35:01.320 --> 35:12.280]  frame everybody today i mean that's your government totally bankrupt totally criminal at the top and
[35:12.280 --> 35:17.560]  they're busy kicking all the good people out and and and then not even just kicking out good people
[35:17.560 --> 35:23.000]  they're brainwashing people there's a lot of people who aren't inherently evil they're just
[35:23.000 --> 35:30.360]  really shallow they're not very smart or they are smart they're so mesmerized in tv and culture
[35:30.360 --> 35:37.960]  that they're not paying attention and so they're told hey we we frame people hey we we torture
[35:37.960 --> 35:43.720]  people hey we uh you know do this and that and it's just like okay well you know i've been given
[35:43.720 --> 35:50.040]  a training manual i'm an army captain it says i torture people it says i stage fake terror attacks
[35:50.040 --> 35:57.240]  that's how we win wars this is just what we do it's just collateral damage you know war you know
[35:57.240 --> 36:01.400]  we kill three thousand so we can save millions from al-qaeda attack
[36:04.840 --> 36:09.480]  and that's the bankrupt mindset that's the bankrupt system
[36:14.280 --> 36:17.320]  let's go to uh igor in virginia igor you're on the air
[36:20.680 --> 36:26.520]  hello yes i don't know i'm a big fan of your show for two years now um 20 years old i came from
[36:26.520 --> 36:33.160]  ukraine at 11 years ago love this country uh i like the romp all was saying uh you know we need to
[36:33.160 --> 36:37.080]  stand up to the new world order and uh i voted for chuck baldman got my citizenship not too long
[36:37.080 --> 36:42.440]  ago good i thought you were not the first uh when i started listening to you but since i started
[36:42.440 --> 36:46.040]  listening to you i started researching instead of like you know reading all these books about the
[36:46.040 --> 36:50.680]  bill de berger's new world order and uh i understood what's going on uh please don't stop talking about
[36:50.680 --> 36:56.840]  this man like like i really feel like you're a legend man no i tell everybody about you uh
[36:56.840 --> 37:01.560]  and uh the most important thing is when you ask questions demand the answers to our problems
[37:01.560 --> 37:07.800]  so obama is not you know he's not talking about any sort of change it's just words it's rhetoric
[37:07.800 --> 37:13.160]  he's uh you know he's lining himself with the same people that have been there for generations now
[37:13.160 --> 37:21.320]  well let me say this i'll tell you who legend is people don't need to build me up as some super
[37:21.320 --> 37:27.880]  human as some special person i'm just somebody who's aggressive and i'm not going to be a slave
[37:28.440 --> 37:34.760]  and so i've taken publicly available information and aggressively told the people that they have
[37:34.760 --> 37:41.240]  power historically and that they are an unstoppable force when they simply set their mind in motion
[37:41.240 --> 37:46.760]  into action so i'll tell you absolutely i'll tell you the legend is Igor it's you the legend is we
[37:46.760 --> 37:54.760]  are is is people like zack before you the legend is the single mom bust in her butt to raise children
[37:54.760 --> 37:59.720]  to not end up in the prison system the legend is the firefighter that goes into a burning house to
[37:59.720 --> 38:05.240]  save children and the floor caves in and he dies or she dies the legend is the people that broke
[38:05.240 --> 38:10.120]  their backs throughout history to stand up against tyranny people like alexander schultz and eason
[38:10.120 --> 38:17.320]  and and that's who we need to respect and appreciate and um look on the surface i do have courage
[38:18.200 --> 38:24.200]  but but but that's a mind trick okay i am able to intellectually understand that there's greater
[38:24.200 --> 38:30.440]  danger not fighting this to my progeny and my progeny come first and we're all connected
[38:30.440 --> 38:39.240]  we're all genetically related everybody is my family and so that is why as a male it isn't
[38:39.240 --> 38:44.760]  something special males are meant when they're when their cave is attacked when there's a threat
[38:45.400 --> 38:50.760]  to stand up and fight it and so i'm doing what i was made to do and the power is people like
[38:50.760 --> 38:55.720]  you spreading the word about the radio show about the websites and god bless you Igor go ahead and
[38:55.720 --> 39:00.840]  finish up absolutely sorry you're absolutely right uh we're all our legends what i meant by
[39:00.840 --> 39:06.360]  when i said legend i meant like that you broke like you know uh you woke me up to what was going
[39:06.360 --> 39:10.760]  on because if you listen to all these idiots you know i'm sorry not it is but like you know all
[39:10.760 --> 39:17.080]  these people on the air and uh you know just spreading garbage you know and all these people
[39:17.080 --> 39:21.880]  brainwash we're like zombies now um anyway my question is sir uh what do you see happen in
[39:21.880 --> 39:26.200]  the next two years with this obama administration because you know the first 100 days is critical
[39:26.200 --> 39:30.520]  and the first two years is when the democrats have full power and how long do you think it will
[39:30.520 --> 39:35.960]  take people to realize that bomb is a fraud and when do you see the war in Iran uh starting and uh
[39:35.960 --> 39:41.960]  the war is expanding thank you sir thank you Igor good to hear from you what will obama do that's
[39:41.960 --> 39:50.040]  question number one number two when will people see through him when will they see through him
[39:51.720 --> 39:58.680]  and the other one is will they attack iran or when when i ran and what i'll do is
[39:59.640 --> 40:03.960]  next hour i will answer those questions because i keep meaning to really get into what
[40:03.960 --> 40:09.000]  obama's saying he's going to do publicly versus who he's hiring what his policies are i'll go over
[40:09.000 --> 40:15.000]  that and then when i think people will wake up to him that'll be when the media finally
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.200]  stops saying he's the christ the second coming and then when they give you a new puppet to
[40:20.200 --> 40:24.920]  believe in so so but but we'll we'll get more into that coming up later uh after i talked to
[40:24.920 --> 40:30.040]  tony ted chris tulia and others but for the next 10 minutes or so he joins us once a month
[40:30.040 --> 40:35.000]  and he's a sponsor of the show i've been here i don't know like three years with us now he's
[40:35.000 --> 40:42.440]  been with genesis for about five six and uh he never sold to the public until michael trudeau
[40:42.440 --> 40:47.080]  the sales manager at genesis who is indoor true organics he's a conservative but he's
[40:47.080 --> 40:51.800]  in organics why have your kids bathed in poison found out about what hospitals and
[40:51.800 --> 40:56.120]  finer hotels were buying and saving money it's funny you get better quality and save money if
[40:56.120 --> 41:01.880]  you know what to do the public buys the toxic chemicals the byproducts of the world war two
[41:01.880 --> 41:06.600]  they figured out to take the toxic waste and put it into your uh put it into your uh what
[41:06.600 --> 41:11.800]  they call shampoos and soaps and cleaners the toxic detergents the byproducts of petrochemical
[41:13.640 --> 41:18.680]  and uh well marty's just got old-fashioned soap and then he and his dad back in 47 when he got
[41:18.680 --> 41:23.400]  back from world war two marty in the chemical corps so he knew what chemical weapons were
[41:23.400 --> 41:28.360]  that's why he freaked out when he read a box of soap found that it wasn't they went back
[41:28.360 --> 41:35.240]  and made the old-fashioned stuff with citrus and vegetables and you know cherry oil uh essence
[41:35.240 --> 41:43.960]  and and and oranges and all of that and uh you save 85 off supermarket prices and i know a lot
[41:43.960 --> 41:50.760]  of people uh now use calvin pure soap i'll be at friends houses and see it on the you know above
[41:50.760 --> 41:55.480]  the sink or i'll be at my aunt and uncles and see it you know in their shower and so i know
[41:56.040 --> 42:00.040]  a lot of people out there are now using it and that's uh very exciting and we're glad
[42:00.040 --> 42:05.640]  that folks are doing that marty good to have you here with us i like the pleasure again to talk to
[42:05.640 --> 42:13.560]  you and your listeners try to bring them up to date marty i'm hearing a disconnect line i think
[42:13.560 --> 42:16.840]  you may have a line on your phone system that's disconnected i'm not sure if that's going out
[42:16.840 --> 42:21.560]  of our air though no i everything seems to be clear your voice is coming through beautifully
[42:22.120 --> 42:28.280]  uh okay fantastic it's gone now uh marty let's uh again i know i we basically tell the same story
[42:28.280 --> 42:34.120]  but slightly you know different areas of it each time it's a big story but i think the most important
[42:34.120 --> 42:37.560]  thing here today is well i mean talk about whatever you want but in the time we have but
[42:38.760 --> 42:45.960]  what is in real soap that you make versus what we're using at the stores we try to make soap
[42:45.960 --> 42:53.880]  from all natural substances we use coconut oils we use vegetable oils we use frutal juices like
[42:53.880 --> 43:02.600]  orange juice and cherry juice and uh honey uh all all these additives to to repel the perfumes
[43:02.600 --> 43:08.760]  that are toxic and all the products you don't need a respirator when you use our products
[43:08.760 --> 43:14.440]  you do need one when you go to the supermarket and one third of that market has cleaning chemicals
[43:14.440 --> 43:21.240]  in it and you it makes it difficult to breathe perfumes are not good for human consumption
[43:21.240 --> 43:28.360]  human use or human smell they're just there to doctor up the detergents that are made from waste
[43:28.360 --> 43:35.480]  petroleum they're real dark chemicals they bleach them out to make them white they pour
[43:36.120 --> 43:43.080]  sodium chloride in it which is table salt to make it free flowing and to kill the bad petroleum
[43:43.080 --> 43:51.320]  odors they use perfumes saturating the product so you can't recognize the fall petroleum that are
[43:51.320 --> 43:57.720]  in the products and what we do is the old-fashioned methods of making the products are dissolving
[43:57.720 --> 44:03.560]  the oils putting in the coconut oils and the vegetable oils compressing them and making products
[44:03.560 --> 44:10.520]  that don't exist in united states today i'm not sure about europe i know we're shipping goods right
[44:10.520 --> 44:17.800]  now to hong kong china because they have nothing like that and we ship tons of our pure soaps to
[44:17.800 --> 44:24.840]  hong kong every month to two big health food stores that distribute our products there
[44:24.840 --> 44:30.440]  and they love it we've been doing that for three years and we've been with you for over three years
[44:30.440 --> 44:38.360]  and we love it marty tell folks about your line of real soaps okay we're talking about
[44:38.360 --> 44:45.160]  about if you wanted to get into bulk packaging of real soaps you can get direct from factory
[44:45.160 --> 44:53.240]  which is us a one to two year supply which is weight out about 65 pounds is equal to a thousand
[44:53.240 --> 44:59.880]  pounds of chemicals of the supermarket for three dollars a week you can get a three to four year
[44:59.880 --> 45:07.480]  supply a hundred and forty five pounds which is equal to two thousand pounds a ton two fifty per
[45:07.480 --> 45:15.960]  week a four to five year supply we're talking 210 pounds for shipping that's equal to supermarket
[45:15.960 --> 45:24.280]  chemicals three thousand pounds over a ton and a half that's two dollars per week what does it
[45:24.280 --> 45:30.440]  cost you now to buy these chemicals in the marketplace and i got what what you call is a public
[45:30.440 --> 45:37.720]  service announcement if you're using and buying from the market toothpaste mouthwash lysol
[45:37.720 --> 45:45.240]  antibacterials all-purpose cleaners oven cleaners shampoos etc let me give you the poison control

[46:17.720 --> 46:24.520]  their manufacturing to china oh absolutely a proctoring gamble was bought by a european company
[46:24.520 --> 46:31.800]  uh what by gelette and then if you expand out from there most of our pharmaceuticals i know it's
[46:31.800 --> 46:37.560]  more than 80 percent are now made uh in china because they can put anything they want in there

[53:24.120 --> 53:25.560]  marty is something else folks
[53:28.440 --> 53:32.040]  i wanted to hold him over to finish his limerick it's bad luck not to finish it and he hung up
[53:33.000 --> 53:36.520]  and i got callers calling in doug in tennessee a calvin testimonial
[53:36.520 --> 53:40.680]  you'll turn into a huge testimonial of people how much they love it
[53:42.680 --> 53:48.040]  i got all this news i need to cover and some of it's really good news like they are successfully
[53:48.040 --> 53:54.520]  growing organs and now i'm planning them in people and people are doing it with their own
[53:54.520 --> 54:00.680]  tissue they're not having to kill a baby to do it you know going back a few years ago there was
[54:00.680 --> 54:04.680]  this big debate about well should we use you know the the tissue of aborted babies and that they
[54:04.680 --> 54:10.360]  call that stem cell but there's some other tissues that are also stem cell like placenta and other
[54:10.360 --> 54:16.520]  things associated with the birth but they were trying to cloud the issue in the media to set the
[54:16.520 --> 54:21.720]  precedent to have these half human half animal chimeras so they could do different genetic
[54:21.720 --> 54:26.120]  experiments and set that precedent but of course then it came out that there are a lot of other
[54:26.120 --> 54:33.160]  tissues that our stem cells in our own bodies they work just as good or better and we don't
[54:33.160 --> 54:41.960]  have to kill a baby to do it so um very interesting news on that front and i also want to go to um
[54:44.200 --> 54:51.800]  tony and ted and chris and tulia many others uh that are patiently holding but but but yeah
[54:51.800 --> 54:56.520]  marty we've gotta hold you over here because we can't not finish the limerick on air go ahead
[54:56.520 --> 55:03.640]  oh my gosh okay let's start again this is a very old one there was a young fellow named
[55:03.640 --> 55:11.560]  sydney who drank till he ruined his kidney it shriveled and shrank as he sat there and drank
[55:12.200 --> 55:18.920]  but he had a good time doing it didn't he hey marty dug in uh and then we'll have a hundred more
[55:18.920 --> 55:23.240]  of these later please folks don't call with testimonials we appreciate it but once we start
[55:23.240 --> 55:30.200]  with one we'll definitely get more it'll be like david joysus show but uh dug in tennessee
[55:30.200 --> 55:36.280]  as he has a calben testimonial go ahead dog tell us about it hey uh alex i used to shave with
[55:36.280 --> 55:46.440]  edge gel and uh one day i read the uh the uh chemical lift on the back and decided you know
[55:46.440 --> 55:51.240]  i didn't want to do this and i thought you know this this calben's soap is pretty slippery maybe
[55:51.240 --> 55:56.840]  i should try that and i just lighted it up on my face and it was actually i got a better shave
[55:56.840 --> 56:04.520]  with that than with the chemical uh edge gel and i really like it you want to know a story
[56:04.520 --> 56:11.480]  i do the same thing with calben bar soap again they figured out how to sell you a million products
[56:11.480 --> 56:17.320]  you don't need shaving cream you don't need all these little side items real soaps you can use
[56:17.320 --> 56:23.240]  for a whole host of the issues and i've noticed since i only use organic deodorant organic
[56:23.240 --> 56:28.120]  products calben's mixed into all that you know i don't have the rashes i don't get the dry skin
[56:28.120 --> 56:33.480]  in the winter the stuff is deadly poison so if you're not going to use calben use some other
[56:33.480 --> 56:38.200]  organic stuff it just for some reason it always costs more than the chemical stuff and calben
[56:38.200 --> 56:43.240]  because it's factory direct costs less than the factory stuff but thank you for that testimonial

[1:00:47.880 --> 1:00:54.040]  then tulia go ahead chris alex just want to thank you very much for all you have done and been
[1:00:54.040 --> 1:01:00.600]  listening to you since 1999 all you've said has either come true or has been true and most of
[1:01:00.600 --> 1:01:06.200]  it i didn't believe at first but i did my own research my own reading and i was actually shocked
[1:01:06.200 --> 1:01:13.480]  to find out how many ways and how far and how much we were under attack and just devastated me uh you
[1:01:13.480 --> 1:01:18.360]  know i've been told by quite a few people don't believe that don't believe me people think i'm
[1:01:18.360 --> 1:01:24.680]  crazy uh but you know when the military we took an oath to defend against both foreign and domestic
[1:01:24.680 --> 1:01:29.400]  enemies so i'm kind of committed to this my questions for you is there's a lot of people
[1:01:29.400 --> 1:01:35.960]  out here who are they're lucky to make their they're lucky to make any kind of money during the week
[1:01:35.960 --> 1:01:41.480]  and they're trying to store up for the things that you recommend you know they can't invest in go
[1:01:41.480 --> 1:01:47.080]  they're lucky if they can pay for food at the week goes do you have any recommendations for those
[1:01:47.080 --> 1:01:54.520]  people and then um i have a second question if you want to answer that one first um well i mean
[1:01:54.520 --> 1:01:58.920]  i'm no genius everybody understands their local environment you know better than somebody off in
[1:01:58.920 --> 1:02:11.320]  austin texas does but stop eating out um you know make food themselves while they still can sell all
[1:02:11.320 --> 1:02:18.760]  the junk they've gotten the garage um i mean even people that don't have a lot of extra income a lot
[1:02:18.760 --> 1:02:26.040]  of times have more stuff than they think they do sell it on ebay uh they don't have a computer you
[1:02:26.040 --> 1:02:35.960]  know sell the local swat me and then just realize that um the biggest issue is being able to feed
[1:02:35.960 --> 1:02:42.360]  themselves and take care of their family and not be stampeded uh by rioting crowds of society does
[1:02:42.360 --> 1:02:47.560]  totally break down and and that may happen undoubtedly we're gonna have a long deep
[1:02:47.560 --> 1:02:54.040]  recession leading into a depression the question is how bad will it get and every indicator is
[1:02:54.040 --> 1:02:59.320]  you know i keep asking the question of the audience why do you think the elite doesn't care now and
[1:02:59.320 --> 1:03:03.400]  is just stealing five trillion dollars in front of you and won't say where two trillion went and
[1:03:04.360 --> 1:03:08.920]  openly bringing in the military to police the american people and it's because i the all the
[1:03:08.920 --> 1:03:13.480]  evidence is that they are going for broke they wouldn't be emerging with the world government
[1:03:13.480 --> 1:03:17.720]  they wouldn't be you know surfacing and then showing everybody if they weren't going to go
[1:03:17.720 --> 1:03:23.640]  ahead and do it all uh and so i would also tell people our mission is more than just protecting
[1:03:23.640 --> 1:03:29.480]  ourselves to help others and so i would also worry about other people and then uh you know god
[1:03:29.480 --> 1:03:34.040]  has a way of taking care of people to do that and so people need to not just get ready not just hide
[1:03:34.040 --> 1:03:41.960]  out uh but but try to speak out and get the word out calling talk radio uh putting out flyers uh
[1:03:41.960 --> 1:03:45.960]  emailing people links to video clips on the web you know whatever you can to wake people up talking
[1:03:45.960 --> 1:03:53.000]  to folks at your church and we may be able to back this thing off uh so stay there uh we'll
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:58.120]  come back to you see if you have any other comments to that when we get back with chris in arkansas
[1:03:58.680 --> 1:04:03.720]  then we'll uh talk to uh tulia rad paul and others stay with me
[1:04:08.600 --> 1:04:12.520]  hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important to be
[1:04:12.520 --> 1:04:16.760]  self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent and food
[1:04:16.760 --> 1:04:21.240]  and water is the key you'll never have to scan in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll
[1:04:21.240 --> 1:04:25.960]  never have to go to the super dome and beg for female to take care of your family in any emergency
[1:04:25.960 --> 1:04:30.920]  if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout of a special interest
[1:04:30.920 --> 1:04:35.320]  so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email they voted
[1:04:35.320 --> 1:04:40.040]  to print eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the
[1:04:40.040 --> 1:04:45.400]  american and european banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings
[1:04:45.400 --> 1:04:50.760]  to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many americans reach
[1:04:50.760 --> 1:04:56.120]  in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached
[1:04:56.120 --> 1:05:01.880]  over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in
[1:05:01.880 --> 1:05:06.680]  sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money
[1:05:06.680 --> 1:05:11.640]  to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business whatever
[1:05:11.640 --> 1:05:16.680]  happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third
[1:05:16.680 --> 1:05:21.480]  of americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends whatever
[1:05:21.480 --> 1:05:26.680]  it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's very important
[1:05:26.680 --> 1:05:30.520]  for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food the government the new old order
[1:05:30.520 --> 1:05:36.040]  has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness
[1:05:36.040 --> 1:05:40.840]  no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you you know efoodsdirect.com

[1:06:39.080 --> 1:06:44.680]  all right let's go back to your phone calls christian arkansas go ahead uh alex the other
[1:06:44.680 --> 1:06:49.800]  thing i moved from austin to little rock and i kind of feel like i'm in the hotbed of where
[1:06:49.800 --> 1:06:55.080]  a lot of these things have originated some kind of a maze but now i'm kind of wondering about
[1:06:55.640 --> 1:07:01.160]  if the bankers the power brokers are intentionally hoping that someone will start some trouble
[1:07:01.160 --> 1:07:07.080]  somewhere so that they can implement martial law and then just kill the united states in that way
[1:07:07.080 --> 1:07:11.400]  through anarchy or just as the continuance of government goes and what your comments will
[1:07:11.400 --> 1:07:15.240]  be on that and i'll take my i'll take it off the air okay i appreciate your call
[1:07:15.240 --> 1:07:20.760]  oh no that's it i mean of the public acquiesces and just let some take the pension funds and
[1:07:20.760 --> 1:07:25.800]  bankrupt everything and then basically all businesses will get government funds to pay
[1:07:25.800 --> 1:07:30.920]  their employees at subsistence level and we'll all be micro managed and the bankers will turn
[1:07:30.920 --> 1:07:38.120]  the money spigots back on for a while uh to uh you know kind of inebriate us uh while they
[1:07:38.120 --> 1:07:45.560]  dine on our hindquarters but um absolutely i mean that's why they're training every local
[1:07:45.560 --> 1:07:51.960]  police department the nation the feds are for ied's roadside uh you know improvised explosive
[1:07:51.960 --> 1:07:58.440]  devices they are i mean literally running around all paranoid like there's just terrorist everywhere
[1:07:58.440 --> 1:08:03.640]  and it's the american people and it's wide al qaeda they're gonna get you because the social
[1:08:03.640 --> 1:08:10.040]  planners the social engineers have admittedly done big war games on how far they can push the public
[1:08:11.080 --> 1:08:15.320]  when the public's going to start striking back uh last weekend the associated press
[1:08:15.320 --> 1:08:22.360]  had a big article with homeland security saying our main threat now isn't terrorist it's the american
[1:08:22.360 --> 1:08:30.520]  people angry over the economy attacking government facilities and they said conversely we're really
[1:08:30.520 --> 1:08:36.760]  worried about people mad at the government doing something during the four million kool-aid drinkers
[1:08:37.800 --> 1:08:45.000]  going to worship uh the new puppet barack obama so they're publicly converting the whole homeland
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:50.040]  security apparatus it was always for us and we always told people it was for us that was in the
[1:08:50.040 --> 1:08:55.880]  white papers and government documents but but publicly it was for shadow men in hiding in caves
[1:08:55.880 --> 1:09:02.040]  who always pop up at key election points or always pop up to second the cia all these al qaeda guys
[1:09:02.040 --> 1:09:07.320]  are popping up with new videos and audio tapes they're always put out by the very same intelligence
[1:09:07.320 --> 1:09:13.560]  agency fronts computer experts look at the videos this is mainstream news and uh you know the al qaeda
[1:09:13.560 --> 1:09:19.960]  watermark uh logo is laid in that we know with the intel centers watermark i mean it's just
[1:09:19.960 --> 1:09:27.080]  unbelievable yes they are releasing the videos themselves it's produced by the same people
[1:09:27.080 --> 1:09:37.880]  understand i mean it's just so cynical very very cynical you know i i'm gonna go back to uh
[1:09:37.880 --> 1:09:41.720]  to lia chris paul anthony uh here just a moment but uh we had a caller last hour
[1:09:41.720 --> 1:09:49.000]  who was asking about what will obama do obama will do everything george bush did
[1:09:50.120 --> 1:09:55.400]  because it's the same agenda it's not george bush's agenda or barack obama's agenda it is the
[1:09:55.400 --> 1:10:02.040]  multinational fortune 100 bought and paid for by the private banking families less than 20 families
[1:10:03.720 --> 1:10:08.760]  they are cold-blooded they don't like people they're eugenicists they believe we're a scourge
[1:10:08.760 --> 1:10:14.680]  they believe we all need to be killed anyways so anything they do they feel good about and then
[1:10:14.680 --> 1:10:23.480]  you understand they feel good about three million dead iraqis they feel good about dead americans
[1:10:24.040 --> 1:10:30.360]  that's job well done for them they feel good about putting police chiefs in charge in crime labs
[1:10:30.360 --> 1:10:35.800]  nationwide who frame anybody they want but then release hundreds of thousands per state
[1:10:35.800 --> 1:10:41.960]  hundreds per thousands per year just in houston alone violent illegal aliens who have raped and
[1:10:41.960 --> 1:10:47.400]  murdered and stolen and molested children that was all in the houston chronicle monday
[1:10:48.920 --> 1:10:55.240]  it's in there all the time citizens have got to be hurt citizens have got to be bankrupted
[1:10:55.240 --> 1:11:01.240]  citizens have got to be squeezed and taught who the boss is we're the bad americans everything
[1:11:01.240 --> 1:11:05.960]  was about setting a trap getting us to trust government getting us to be bleeding heart liberals
[1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:11.400]  getting us on the government trough getting control of our lives turning our children against us
[1:11:11.400 --> 1:11:17.000]  then getting us all in debt to the point where they could bankrupt the whole society and then
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:23.400]  point the working class at the new vorice at the upper middle class and say that's the rich
[1:11:23.400 --> 1:11:29.640]  let's loot them they cause the economy to have the problems and then they're going to sick
[1:11:29.640 --> 1:11:36.520]  the blue collar now in shiny fancy uniforms on the middle class and they are going to rape you
[1:11:36.520 --> 1:11:41.720]  financially and they are going to take everything you've got they're going to take your pension funds
[1:11:41.720 --> 1:11:47.480]  they're going to take your savings they're going to turn a horde of blue collar people loose on you
[1:11:47.480 --> 1:11:55.000]  just like the founding fathers warned you the howl of the mob the mad howl of democracy
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:12:01.480]  there's no democracy in positioning this and setting this up but then in the final equation
[1:12:03.160 --> 1:12:05.720]  they turn the mob loose on the middle class
[1:12:07.960 --> 1:12:12.360]  and they will slit your throat in the middle of the street for a dollar
[1:12:14.360 --> 1:12:19.000]  and so that's what barack obama is going to do he is going to be the messianic savior the economy
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:24.040]  employees can be blamed on bush he is going to give people government jobs welfare they're going
[1:12:24.040 --> 1:12:29.160]  to accelerate the currency they're going to devalue it they're going to give the devaluing
[1:12:29.160 --> 1:12:36.360]  currency to the public for taco bell tacos and and and and and and and and 12 packs and in cases of
[1:12:36.360 --> 1:12:44.120]  bud light and they are going to turn them loose on you i mean it's not going to be pretty that's
[1:12:44.120 --> 1:12:52.040]  what i'm really most concerned about and already i mean it's all over the news the left is suddenly
[1:12:52.040 --> 1:12:57.320]  yeah i don't think obama isn't tough he's going into pakistan and i and i ran if he needs to and
[1:12:57.320 --> 1:13:03.400]  he's going into afghanistan and yeah you know what we're gonna get tough with terrorist
[1:13:03.400 --> 1:13:08.120]  we're gonna take the gloves off and people are like man maybe i like torture now maybe i like spying
[1:13:10.440 --> 1:13:15.640]  you see they they teach you to hate bush the media lets you know about the torture and let you
[1:13:15.640 --> 1:13:20.520]  know about 9 11 and let you know about all of this they let it out on the download as i told you
[1:13:20.520 --> 1:13:25.640]  on the day of 9 11 they were going to allow this out blame it on america have henry polson come out
[1:13:25.640 --> 1:13:30.040]  and say we're sorry the american government let you down and we're sorry the american people
[1:13:30.040 --> 1:13:37.160]  were lazy and greedy we're sorry world we will now pay we will now devalue our currency and put
[1:13:37.160 --> 1:13:45.240]  the money into your coffers before it's devalued it's our fault see the globalists didn't like
[1:13:45.240 --> 1:13:49.880]  the czar so they slaughtered 60 million and they didn't rush it they didn't like the chinese people
[1:13:49.880 --> 1:13:57.560]  they thrown off the uh control by the colonial system so they sent in the commies they killed 85
[1:13:57.560 --> 1:14:03.240]  mil you know the news says 60 mil the chinese government says 80 mil they're actually proud of
[1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:08.920]  it go pull it up go do research on it find out i'm telling you the truth and see they want to do
[1:14:08.920 --> 1:14:19.880]  that here they want to show you who boss is and they will turn the starving hordes loose on you
[1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:26.680]  and if you run to other countries they're going to do it there too anybody with money unless you're
[1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:32.920]  living in dubai or the cook islands or switzerland and then they're not going to let you in unless
[1:14:32.920 --> 1:14:38.920]  you got hundreds of millions you're there to be thrown in the lions and then obama like it's a
[1:14:38.920 --> 1:14:43.320]  gladiatorial arena he'll because he's going to be up there laughing they're going to love him
[1:14:45.080 --> 1:14:45.720]  you understand
[1:14:49.480 --> 1:14:52.440]  and they're going to bring in carbon taxes and tax and regulate everybody
[1:14:53.800 --> 1:14:56.280]  but all the poor people standing at bus stops they're not going to care
[1:14:56.280 --> 1:15:03.480]  because on the news they're going to see people in million dollar houses having their homes
[1:15:03.480 --> 1:15:09.160]  repossessed and you know handed over to local government people it's bad folks i mean the people
[1:15:09.160 --> 1:15:14.120]  that ran linen the people that ran hitler the people that ran mal they're in control here and
[1:15:14.120 --> 1:15:18.680]  they mean that they want to hurt you bad and i'm sorry if that's scary and people don't want to
[1:15:18.680 --> 1:15:27.240]  believe it but um that's one scenario that's the most dangerous scenario if the people rebel and
[1:15:27.240 --> 1:15:33.240]  resist and speak out and say no at every level then what they're going to do is let obama get a
[1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:37.800]  lot done for two years get a carbon tax in regulation start to stage some terror attacks
[1:15:38.360 --> 1:15:43.240]  start going after militias and claiming you know that they're in bed with white supremacists and
[1:15:43.240 --> 1:15:48.680]  they wanted to you know they'll stage some racial crimes and have some hate speech laws passed and
[1:15:48.680 --> 1:15:54.440]  they'll start shutting the web down get more people on welfare and then they'll have some
[1:15:54.440 --> 1:16:01.080]  scandals and burn obama and bring a republican in four years but i don't see that happening
[1:16:01.080 --> 1:16:05.400]  because i've never seen them call somebody a messiah i've never seen them
[1:16:05.400 --> 1:16:14.920]  um set something up like this unless it was mal or hitler or linen i mean they are saying he is
[1:16:14.920 --> 1:16:18.920]  the one obama mania president of the world the man that will fix it all the one
[1:16:22.040 --> 1:16:29.160]  now let's go to your calls here uh tulia in our tula in new mexico welcome hello hi hi
[1:16:29.160 --> 1:16:36.600]  hi uh alex have you ever heard of someone named lance von livenfeld i have refreshed my memory
[1:16:36.600 --> 1:16:42.760]  um he published a magazine well to back it up a little bit did you hear about the what obama
[1:16:42.760 --> 1:16:50.680]  had in his pocket the night he got elected no he had some trinkets okay and it came out on cnn the
[1:16:50.680 --> 1:17:01.000]  next day and what it was was a hindu deity a monkey and um if you go back to the works of
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:08.840]  lance von livenfeld who published a magazine in germany uh predating the beginning of um
[1:17:08.840 --> 1:17:15.320]  the third rike he was a mentor of adolf hitlers and he had a magazine called the estara yes now
[1:17:15.320 --> 1:17:21.560]  no he has yeah and he had a big new age temple in berlin right and he published a book called of
[1:17:21.560 --> 1:17:30.760]  sodom's monkey which really became the protocol for the thule and viril society but it was also
[1:17:30.760 --> 1:17:36.520]  the beginning of not really the beginning of the eugenics society because the eugenics society
[1:17:36.520 --> 1:17:41.880]  began in new england in 1927 my tribe which i don't want to mention their name right now
[1:17:41.880 --> 1:17:48.200]  you know we found all the the paperwork on the eugenics society of the defective humans
[1:17:48.200 --> 1:17:56.680]  but basically lance von livenfeld whole whole thesis about sodom's monkey which is why obama
[1:17:56.680 --> 1:18:01.960]  had it in his pocket you know how they talk in codes yeah they talk to each other in codes and
[1:18:01.960 --> 1:18:06.680]  then they they they put all this other garbage the big well it's like i think they call it a
[1:18:06.680 --> 1:18:11.240]  sigil they like focus their energies on little idols i call the bohemian growth members worship

[1:22:26.440 --> 1:22:38.120]  well i don't know about
[1:22:39.960 --> 1:22:50.440]  little magic uh trinkets in obama's pocket i know hillary wears cabala bracelets and
[1:22:50.440 --> 1:22:58.280]  madonna does and only's hollywood stars have got cabalic occultic stuff tattooed all over
[1:22:58.280 --> 1:23:08.600]  whatever i mean this is big but i'll check into the uh full society a monkey uh you know cnn
[1:23:08.600 --> 1:23:13.240]  announcing who he has a little special in his pocket and we've had tax mars to talk about how
[1:23:13.240 --> 1:23:17.400]  they uh in buildings they built you know they put these little secret chambers in to put
[1:23:17.400 --> 1:23:26.040]  similar things in them but um i know his actions he immediately got hundreds of millions of dollars
[1:23:26.040 --> 1:23:31.080]  that bush from political pressure he had to do a few things cut from the united nations
[1:23:31.080 --> 1:23:36.840]  that was used in china for forced abortion now the news uses the term coerced abortion they
[1:23:37.640 --> 1:23:42.440]  i mean they kill the baby in front of you i mean they drown the babies in some cases and others
[1:23:42.440 --> 1:23:49.240]  they just find you huge amounts of money and then take your child to be raised in a government
[1:23:49.240 --> 1:23:54.440]  facility and people actually went on info wars dot com and then the comments section and said
[1:23:54.440 --> 1:24:01.960]  oh you just don't like obama so what is a coerced is not forced you know just living in total denial
[1:24:01.960 --> 1:24:10.760]  about china so i know he's doing that in china and in africa and the eugenics money is flowing now
[1:24:10.760 --> 1:24:15.960]  to be technical the article didn't get into that he makes it partisan bush cut the funding one place
[1:24:15.960 --> 1:24:22.520]  but then increased it in another so what he did was uh was a bait and switch or or you know he
[1:24:22.520 --> 1:24:28.760]  he just simply moved it a shell game is the proper term but but i know that the real eugenics societies
[1:24:28.760 --> 1:24:35.560]  were set up in in in 1846 by sir francis gallton and then the other world society set up at the
[1:24:35.560 --> 1:24:42.440]  turn of the last century and then through the 20s colesprings harbour where it's the ibn eugenics
[1:24:43.080 --> 1:24:49.560]  uh human genome project today and it's openly eugenics they study their race specific bio weapons
[1:24:50.520 --> 1:24:55.800]  but you were making your point about the little uh the little do you remember the headline because
[1:24:55.800 --> 1:25:01.400]  i'll google that right now i want to look that up while it was on cnn and the news on the television
[1:25:01.400 --> 1:25:09.160]  but basically it's a hanaman and this hanaman what i'm trying to explain is a principle an esoteric
[1:25:09.160 --> 1:25:17.240]  principle of course which connotates the defective humans and with my tribe when the eugenics society
[1:25:17.240 --> 1:25:22.600]  came up in the state in new england they went down they did a door-to-door statistical study
[1:25:23.160 --> 1:25:31.320]  of 250 families which they called defective humans and um they had long hair they wrote
[1:25:31.320 --> 1:25:37.560]  down they had moccasins they did beadwork and and then these families 250 of them disappeared
[1:25:38.440 --> 1:25:45.000]  oh i know it's on cbc right now that they still go arrest uh the health department uh the native
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:49.160]  children and they just take them to a camp and kill them and then i tell people that i mean that's on
[1:25:49.160 --> 1:25:53.560]  cbc and then nothing happens the government goes yeah we're killing them and that's the way it is
[1:25:53.560 --> 1:25:59.080]  well george busch senior as you know then ran the eugenics operations in the 70s and and the
[1:25:59.080 --> 1:26:05.160]  government's own number 44 percent of native women were sterilized yes and then people
[1:26:05.800 --> 1:26:10.040]  on reservations and people laugh and email me going oh they conked them on the head
[1:26:10.600 --> 1:26:13.720]  know that the health department came around with police and threw them in chains and took
[1:26:13.720 --> 1:26:21.880]  them like you taken wild animal and uh and uh carried out all sorts of things on them but
[1:26:21.880 --> 1:26:30.760]  we had 50 50 suicides since january um ranging from six years old to 18 hanging themselves
[1:26:30.760 --> 1:26:38.040]  with dog collars and and all these kids have cell phones on one this is just on one reservation
[1:26:38.600 --> 1:26:43.720]  50 yeah major six-year-old kid tried to hang himself and and was saved last week
[1:26:45.080 --> 1:26:50.840]  that's my control yeah i mean we have been experiencing the new world order but to get back
[1:26:50.840 --> 1:27:00.360]  to what berg was saying the other day about um barry um that george hw bush is not a bush
[1:27:01.400 --> 1:27:09.160]  he was born in germany he was adopted by prescott bush and i'm looking at a picture right here

[1:27:15.800 --> 1:27:22.440]  and i'm looking at a picture of him with bohrman as a as a 18-year-old young guy before he came

[1:31:23.320 --> 1:31:29.000]  the information war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:31:29.000 --> 1:31:43.240]  i tell you man our guests we go over it and over it with them and they just can't
[1:31:44.280 --> 1:31:48.120]  you ever get time zones straight which is fine with me i don't care but we're going to probably
[1:31:48.120 --> 1:31:55.720]  have uh... david uh... xyron on later in the sour and then early into the next hour instead of
[1:31:55.720 --> 1:32:00.440]  next hour because he's calling us up thinking that we that he was supposed to be on 30 minutes
[1:32:00.440 --> 1:32:06.280]  ago but say lobby it doesn't even really matter uh... i want to go ahead and play this clip this
[1:32:06.280 --> 1:32:15.480]  is a himself on uh... on cnn and he's uh... talking about some of the things that happen
[1:32:15.480 --> 1:32:29.720]  to him but but first the host explains to you in the peace on cnn that
[1:32:29.720 --> 1:32:34.360]  they're changing of the patriot act administratively
[1:32:34.360 --> 1:32:39.000]  bush is that's all his fault it's just because he's a republican and because
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:44.520]  he's an evil white guy uh... to where they can spy on anybody and everybody domestically
[1:32:44.520 --> 1:32:47.800]  the state police can with federal funds that's actually what it states
[1:32:47.800 --> 1:32:56.840]  or the feds can no warrants no investigations even non-terror related non-crime related
[1:32:56.840 --> 1:33:05.640]  i covered this some last week non-crime related this has been on cnn msnbc cnbc and they
[1:33:06.280 --> 1:33:08.840]  they say in ross story and all these other places
[1:33:08.840 --> 1:33:14.440]  oh obama can overturn it because bush just did it and something a president does 60 days
[1:33:14.440 --> 1:33:20.440]  you know becomes law with an executive order no it doesn't obama could overturn any of this
[1:33:20.440 --> 1:33:27.640]  but everywhere is this p r that obama fought the bailout but it still happened obama fought the
[1:33:27.640 --> 1:33:32.680]  expansion of the patriot act but bush did it but she just keeps doing everything
[1:33:32.680 --> 1:33:38.520]  and the public has no idea how government works they have no idea this is a ball
[1:33:39.080 --> 1:33:43.960]  faced lie so see they make it all about
[1:33:46.360 --> 1:33:51.000]  the evil right winger so i wanted to ask uh... david uh... ziren who is a great writer
[1:33:52.600 --> 1:33:56.280]  sports writer also political writer what rights for the nation a bunch of the publications
[1:33:56.280 --> 1:34:00.040]  i mean are they going to be concerned about rock obama when all this stuff continues and expands
[1:34:00.040 --> 1:34:04.040]  under him or is it all just about george bush
[1:34:04.680 --> 1:34:09.320]  because he i mean i'm upset about the spying and the secret police you know i understand the
[1:34:09.320 --> 1:34:14.200]  president's a puppet see i grew up a long time ago and so i'm asking them i mean have you grown up
[1:34:14.200 --> 1:34:19.240]  or is it all about the big bad george bush and we'll just get george bush pinatas out and we'll
[1:34:19.240 --> 1:34:24.840]  we'll hit on them and i'm saying barack obama's a puppet and so people are going what are you for
[1:34:24.840 --> 1:34:31.320]  obama we need to focus in more on him no he's a puppet too they don't the establishment doesn't
[1:34:31.320 --> 1:34:35.400]  want you knowing that their puppets they want to make it all about them instead of about
[1:34:35.400 --> 1:34:40.200]  who pulls their strings will play this clip then go to your calls and then we'll get uh
[1:34:41.480 --> 1:34:50.600]  david ziren on him here we go
[1:34:50.600 --> 1:34:55.880]  bush rides back to his ranch in texas he hopes to finalize over 90 new federal regulations
[1:34:55.880 --> 1:35:00.360]  now in truth finalizing regulations at the last minute is common practice among outgoing presidents
[1:35:00.360 --> 1:35:05.880]  but the bush administration is hoping to expand it and making their final regulation adjustments
[1:35:05.880 --> 1:35:11.640]  more permanent why stop now after all the president has accelerated the process to try to ensure
[1:35:11.640 --> 1:35:16.920]  that the changes he wants will be finalized by november 22nd that's 60 days before the obama
[1:35:16.920 --> 1:35:21.480]  administration takes control that's dubiously convenient timing because most federal rules
[1:35:21.480 --> 1:35:27.960]  take effect 60 days after they've been finalized so then they're harder to turn back here you go
[1:35:27.960 --> 1:35:33.240]  president obama good luck on doing this stuff get in the chopper everybody quick so what do we
[1:35:33.240 --> 1:35:36.920]  have to look forward to from the bush last days in the white house you want one that'll kick
[1:35:36.920 --> 1:35:41.400]  opponents of the patriot act patriot act right in the teeth how about law enforcement officials
[1:35:41.400 --> 1:35:47.560]  spying on us all of us everyone even if non criminals not engaging in criminal activities
[1:35:47.560 --> 1:35:52.920]  are among us and edna you too in july the justice department proposed a regulation that would allow
[1:35:52.920 --> 1:35:58.040]  state and local law enforcement agencies to collect intelligence on individuals and organizations
[1:35:58.040 --> 1:36:03.880]  even if the or the information is unrelated to any criminal matter think about that for a minute
[1:36:03.880 --> 1:36:07.080]  sure go ahead collect the intelligence doesn't have to have anything to do with the criminal
[1:36:07.080 --> 1:36:12.120]  investigation president bush according to the washington independent is keen on the idea
[1:36:12.120 --> 1:36:17.480]  even if they weren't already watching you they soon could be really easily joining us now my
[1:36:17.480 --> 1:36:21.560]  friend the sports writer dave ziren he's sports correspondent with the nation magazine he got a
[1:36:21.560 --> 1:36:25.960]  little taste of this from the government earlier this year mr ziren thanks for coming on great to
[1:36:25.960 --> 1:36:30.920]  be on rachel but i gotta say if your unpopularity is over 76 you shouldn't be allowed to use the
[1:36:30.920 --> 1:36:37.080]  white house remote control at that point alone dramatically change the justice orientation of
[1:36:37.080 --> 1:36:41.880]  the country hemorrhoids are more popular than this man why is he making laws i'm very angry well
[1:36:41.880 --> 1:36:45.800]  he's doing it in the way that will make them hard to reverse that's right now david i wanted you to
[1:36:45.800 --> 1:36:50.680]  be on the show tonight because you went through an experience like this what bush is proposing for
[1:36:50.680 --> 1:36:55.560]  the whole country in to come to maryland now what did you go through well the maryland state police
[1:36:55.560 --> 1:37:00.760]  sent people to infiltrate meetings i was in a very seditious organization called the campaign
[1:37:00.760 --> 1:37:05.800]  to end the death penalty where we planned such horrifying acts like tabling at the local farmers
[1:37:05.800 --> 1:37:11.720]  market or planning rallies i mean constitutionally protected activities the most basic kinds of things
[1:37:11.720 --> 1:37:16.200]  that i think sometimes we take for granted and the horrible thing was that not only did they send
[1:37:16.200 --> 1:37:21.240]  people in the spy on us to take notes on what we were doing notes on what we were saying but also
[1:37:21.240 --> 1:37:26.280]  according to their own documents they would come back in even after they determined that we weren't
[1:37:26.280 --> 1:37:31.240]  doing anything wrong they were sent back in to spy on us and it turned why were they spying on us
[1:37:31.240 --> 1:37:35.480]  because the governor at the time bob erlich a right-wing republican who makes sarah paleon look
[1:37:35.480 --> 1:37:41.720]  like emma goldman i mean he was somebody who saw us as political opponents he was for the death
[1:37:41.720 --> 1:37:46.680]  penalty we were against the death penalty therefore in his mind we deserve to be spied upon and so
[1:37:46.680 --> 1:37:51.080]  we essentially used homeland security powers of the state government to go after you guys yeah we
[1:37:51.080 --> 1:37:57.000]  were sent we were entered into a database the heading of which was terrorist slash anti-government
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:03.080]  and anti-war activists were entered in a database that was called terrorist slash anti-war and then
[1:38:03.080 --> 1:38:07.000]  the person who organized all of this the head of the maryland state police a man by the name of tim
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:12.840]  hutchins who was once named by your friend keith one of the worst people in the world uh tim hutchins
[1:38:12.840 --> 1:38:17.320]  he called us fringe people in the hearings he said we deserved it because we were fringe people so
[1:38:17.320 --> 1:38:21.400]  one of the things i want to ask is who's the real fringe person here people who actually believe in
[1:38:21.400 --> 1:38:27.000]  the constitution or people like tim hutchins who use it like kleenex did any of the um politicians
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:30.920]  any of the people who were involved in this getting trouble for doing what they did it was all
[1:38:30.920 --> 1:38:36.200]  exposed ultimately it was all exposed but here's the problem to use a sports metaphor the expose
[1:38:36.200 --> 1:38:41.240]  by former attorney general steve sacks was the equivalent of driving 99 yards for a touchdown
[1:38:41.240 --> 1:38:46.440]  and then taking a knee i mean the report revealed every last bit of anti-constitutional behavior
[1:38:46.440 --> 1:38:51.160]  by the maryland state police but then all the recommendations were looking forward about future
[1:38:51.160 --> 1:38:56.200]  laws future safeguards and we believe people really need to be held into account for this
[1:38:56.200 --> 1:39:01.000]  bob urlick tim hutchins i mean that we either have a constitution or we don't either our rights
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:05.320]  were violated or they weren't and i mean there's fine on sports writers here rachel i mean i ain't
[1:39:05.320 --> 1:39:11.240]  at edda here you know i mean i got my politics but this is ridiculous well the prospect of this
[1:39:11.240 --> 1:39:15.880]  being expanded nationwide essentially giving a justice department federal government green light
[1:39:15.880 --> 1:39:21.880]  to local and state law enforcement agencies to collect intelligence on anybody regardless of
[1:39:21.880 --> 1:39:26.600]  criminal suspicion which is what you went through they're talking about expanding this nationwide
[1:39:26.600 --> 1:39:30.840]  and what they will say in order to argue for it is so what's the harm done to davis what's the harm
[1:39:30.840 --> 1:39:35.640]  done here's the harm because i'll quote senator ben cardin from maryland because it has a chilling
[1:39:35.640 --> 1:39:40.760]  effect on the constitution it has a chilling effect on our ability to assemble i mean we have to
[1:39:40.760 --> 1:39:45.160]  remember that we're living in a time where 85 percent of the country thinks it's moving into the wrong
[1:39:45.160 --> 1:39:49.480]  in the wrong direction i mean this is a time where we need to be welcoming new people into
[1:39:49.480 --> 1:39:55.160]  community activism welcoming new new people into into struggle and what you have instead is people
[1:39:55.160 --> 1:39:59.480]  looking at each other in maryland as if is that person an enemy is this person a plant
[1:39:59.480 --> 1:40:04.680]  and it has a horrible effect right at a time where in the wake of the obama victory and he joins us
[1:40:04.680 --> 1:40:11.400]  and now we'll be taking your calls coming up in the next hour uh davis iran is our guest and you
[1:40:11.400 --> 1:40:18.760]  can go up to info wars dot com and link over uh to his website if you'd like his website is edge
[1:40:18.760 --> 1:40:26.520]  of sports dot com uh davis iran it's good to have you on with us hey great to be here thank you
[1:40:27.240 --> 1:40:30.520]  i was playing that news clip i think you really succinctly and in just a few minutes
[1:40:31.160 --> 1:40:37.240]  um broke it down but i wanted to tell the host this is already nationwide i mean they already
[1:40:37.240 --> 1:40:42.120]  have army intelligence spying on people here in austin texas that's in our newspaper in
[1:40:42.120 --> 1:40:47.400]  houston texas it's going on all over the country in denver you know cops were beating up other
[1:40:47.400 --> 1:40:53.720]  cops and blaming it on protesters so yeah you know that's actually a point that a lot of people
[1:40:53.720 --> 1:40:59.080]  emailed me after i was on that show was a very interesting thing first of all about talking
[1:40:59.080 --> 1:41:05.640]  about that i mean first of all i got a lot of support emails and people who called themselves
[1:41:05.640 --> 1:41:11.800]  democrats republicans lefties righties i mean because it seems to cross a line for all of us
[1:41:11.800 --> 1:41:17.240]  who live in this country like this idea that you just can't sit in a room and even just talk about
[1:41:17.240 --> 1:41:22.440]  an issue without worrying about being spied upon it just seems to cross a pretty sacred line for a
[1:41:22.440 --> 1:41:27.400]  lot of people then the other thing was yeah just like you said a lot of people got in touch with me
[1:41:27.400 --> 1:41:33.320]  and said let's not be naive here let's not think this takes some sort of special public law this
[1:41:33.320 --> 1:41:39.880]  stuff is happening already well it's always been going on you know since the fifties uh but i mean
[1:41:39.880 --> 1:41:48.120]  now uh it's against anybody the left the right they're spying on everyone and and and just the
[1:41:48.120 --> 1:41:53.960]  opposite of a free society uh but specifically how did you learn you were being spied on
[1:41:55.080 --> 1:42:00.840]  uh it's a great question and the randomness of how i found out and how it became public only
[1:42:00.840 --> 1:42:07.480]  speaks more to how just frightening all of this is there is a gentleman uh an anti-war activist
[1:42:07.480 --> 1:42:15.080]  named max obishevsky in baltimore and max had the feeling that he was being followed or tailed
[1:42:15.960 --> 1:42:23.480]  and so what he did was he went to the aclu and asked them to file a state freedom of information
[1:42:23.480 --> 1:42:31.000]  acroquest and what was produced what out of three thousand pages that they had they gave
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:37.640]  41 of those pages and on those 41 pages what was revealed was not just things about max
[1:42:38.280 --> 1:42:44.200]  but just all kinds of of drippings and droppings about other surveillance that had been done
[1:42:44.840 --> 1:42:52.360]  including a surveillance on my little anti-death penalty group and the thing about it that really
[1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:58.600]  caught people's eye and that turned it in there to a national scandal was that it was clear from
[1:42:58.600 --> 1:43:05.240]  looking at the document that the malin state police continued to surveil even after they had
[1:43:05.240 --> 1:43:12.520]  made the internal determination that nothing illegal was going on so it became surveillance for the
[1:43:12.520 --> 1:43:20.120]  sake of surveillance and when you couple that with the fact that the death penalty has nothing to do
[1:43:20.120 --> 1:43:26.120]  with any of what homeland security fund is supposed to be funding i mean what does the
[1:43:26.120 --> 1:43:30.360]  anti-death penalty process have to do with protecting the homeland and and i'll come
[1:43:30.360 --> 1:43:36.120]  here and terrorism and all that stuff i mean it just it went from the ridiculous to the
[1:43:36.120 --> 1:43:41.320]  offensive very quickly in people's minds well you know the famous case back in the 70s of the
[1:43:41.320 --> 1:43:47.400]  texas state police with 300 000 people in files spying on every major preacher in every town
[1:43:47.400 --> 1:43:52.200]  keeping notes on what everyone said and that was found to be illegal and they never quit they just
[1:43:52.200 --> 1:43:56.520]  went underground and of course they're federally funded uh the state police were actually founded
[1:43:56.520 --> 1:44:01.240]  by roosevelt and so they're really a federally chartered operation most people don't know that
[1:44:01.240 --> 1:44:07.320]  but specifically what i'm worried about is this i would love to think rock obama is great but he's
[1:44:07.320 --> 1:44:13.400]  already saying hey the troops are gonna stay there till 2011 2012 till we look at it uh he's already
[1:44:13.400 --> 1:44:17.720]  saying yeah warrantless wiretapping we're gonna do it he's all you know hillary clinton old guard
[1:44:17.720 --> 1:44:23.560]  it's all coming in but regardless i see these shows and it's like oh bush is dastardly expanding
[1:44:23.560 --> 1:44:29.480]  this right before he leaves so it makes it harder for obama to reverse it obama could sign an order
[1:44:29.480 --> 1:44:36.200]  to in reverse it uh the courts can come in and reverse it so i i mean i see a lot of uh a lot
[1:44:36.200 --> 1:44:41.080]  of backpedaling and a lot of establishment left and i don't care about left and right i just don't
[1:44:41.080 --> 1:44:47.640]  want sacred police spying on me uh you know yeah i i think uh i'll give some credit to uh
[1:44:48.360 --> 1:44:54.040]  Matthews on msnbc because he did a segment yesterday about a lot of this and then the segment was
[1:44:54.040 --> 1:45:00.760]  called brother can you spare some change and i thought it was a good statement to ask obama
[1:45:00.760 --> 1:45:07.480]  because hey you can't run on change and then come to us with more of the same i mean we we can't
[1:45:07.480 --> 1:45:13.400]  accept that we can't accept real debate in this country to only happen in the couple of months
[1:45:13.400 --> 1:45:17.720]  before presidential election and i'll tell you what a lot of people are going to be keeping
[1:45:17.720 --> 1:45:23.240]  their eye on i mean one of the great criticisms of bush and change was the expansion of the
[1:45:23.240 --> 1:45:30.120]  executive the expansion of the power of the executive branch will obama roll that back when
[1:45:30.120 --> 1:45:37.400]  he comes into office i think most people will say no he won't but i think there's the expectation
[1:45:38.040 --> 1:45:40.360]  that he should well i mean how
[1:45:42.200 --> 1:45:47.720]  speak about the 94 republican revolution that swept the republicans into office because
[1:45:47.720 --> 1:45:50.920]  one of the things that allowed them to be swept in was so many people
[1:45:51.800 --> 1:45:56.440]  stayed at home those midterm elections because they were so disgusted by the broken promises
[1:45:56.440 --> 1:46:02.440]  of clinton those first two years all kinds of lip service and then nothing to show for those first
[1:46:02.440 --> 1:46:08.280]  couple years and i think obama better be very careful i mean he can't draw the lesson that
[1:46:08.280 --> 1:46:13.640]  clinton was too left-wing his first two years in office clinton got nothing done his first two years
[1:46:13.640 --> 1:46:19.720]  in office and then the people especially young people stayed home and so we'll see if obama
[1:46:19.720 --> 1:46:25.000]  learned that lesson from history but given the fact that he has all these clintonians around him it
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:30.200]  does make you wonder well i mean you write for the nation some other big publications that would
[1:46:30.200 --> 1:46:36.200]  be called progressive or or uh... you know kind of right about sports well i mean i understand
[1:46:36.200 --> 1:46:40.600]  that but i mean you're around those people and you go on tv and and then talk about issues
[1:46:40.600 --> 1:46:44.840]  what are people kind of in the establishment left that you bump elbows with are they starting
[1:46:44.840 --> 1:46:51.480]  to get a little little concerned about obama i think at this point state and one of the good
[1:46:51.480 --> 1:46:55.160]  things about being a sports writer in these publications writing about where sports and
[1:46:55.160 --> 1:47:01.160]  politics collide one of the disadvantages is maybe the absolute center and get to hear all
[1:47:01.160 --> 1:47:06.520]  the scuttle but one of the advantages that get to at least see a lot of the forest for the trees
[1:47:06.520 --> 1:47:10.840]  and i would say at this point they still have the obama kool-aid hooked up via ivy
[1:47:11.560 --> 1:47:19.240]  into their arms and it's going to take a minute before any sort of honeymoon is over on this
[1:47:19.240 --> 1:47:24.200]  front i mean they're gonna i mean right now i just was talking to a bunch of them the other day and
[1:47:24.200 --> 1:47:29.320]  they're they're all of a sudden saying well illy clinton you know she could be a fine secretary
[1:47:29.320 --> 1:47:34.600]  of state the hard worker very intelligent i said well weren't you the same person arguing that we
[1:47:34.600 --> 1:47:39.960]  had to turn each on the clinton era i was just turning the page on the clinton and i think well
[1:47:39.960 --> 1:47:45.080]  you got to give him a chance to be in a naysayer already you know that he hasn't even been inaugurated
[1:47:45.080 --> 1:47:51.160]  yet but you know past this prologue as they say i mean he is laying the groundwork right now and
[1:47:51.720 --> 1:47:57.640]  i'll tell you something there's something bizarre about our side you know people who want to see
[1:47:57.640 --> 1:48:01.320]  change and i'm not saying right wing left wing but people who want to see change people who want
[1:48:01.320 --> 1:48:06.200]  to see the end of torture people who want to see the end of of corporate crime and skull duggery
[1:48:06.760 --> 1:48:12.120]  that we're somehow going to be silent and give them a chance meanwhile all of these other forces
[1:48:12.120 --> 1:48:17.240]  the old clintonites what have you that the the the national security state do you think they're
[1:48:17.240 --> 1:48:21.640]  keeping their mouth shut and saying let's give them a chance no they're trying to have influence
[1:48:21.640 --> 1:48:29.240]  right now as we speak so just well that's exactly what i was about to ask you people need to put
[1:48:29.240 --> 1:48:34.200]  pressure on him now and then there might be some change but if people signal oh we're just in love
[1:48:34.200 --> 1:48:40.840]  with you and have lovey-dovey eyes and are swooning they're gonna go crazy so so let's talk about

[1:52:23.560 --> 1:52:30.280]  have david ray griffin and steven jones joining us coming up uh in the hour after that our guest
[1:52:30.280 --> 1:52:36.040]  is a sports writer who also crosses over to covering the emergence of sports becoming more
[1:52:36.040 --> 1:52:41.000]  political kind of like the hollywood folks have been so political for 50 60 years well just now
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:46.760]  we're seeing i guess kind of with like a charles barkley going back a decade ago the rise of sports
[1:52:46.760 --> 1:52:51.800]  people uh who he was saying during the break he believes are getting more cultural currency
[1:52:51.800 --> 1:52:56.840]  than hollywood folks into politics so we'll talk about that before he leaves us uh but finishing
[1:52:56.840 --> 1:53:02.920]  up with a spied on uh after you learn you've been spied on had uh were they still following you around
[1:53:02.920 --> 1:53:09.000]  or going to your meetings or you know watching the evil sports writer uh or uh you know by then
[1:53:09.800 --> 1:53:15.240]  have the investigation on you end it according to the reports and once again we're just going
[1:53:15.240 --> 1:53:21.480]  by the reports here the investigation itself had ended and since all this took place you know more
[1:53:21.480 --> 1:53:27.000]  freedom of information act requests have come through uh for information has revealed itself
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:34.840]  and it turns out they were spying on everybody from anti-war groups to the chesapeake climate
[1:53:34.840 --> 1:53:40.680]  control committee and so you look at the whole broad swath of who they were spying on and it's
[1:53:40.680 --> 1:53:47.240]  pretty much anybody that was trying to have any sort of community or civic interaction
[1:53:47.240 --> 1:53:52.760]  with the government was spied upon and to me it's it's evidence of a lot of things it's evidence
[1:53:52.760 --> 1:53:58.920]  that the previous governor here bob erlich was uh as paranoid as nixon in terms of his own
[1:53:58.920 --> 1:54:04.600]  political stability but it also says something really interesting to me about homeland security
[1:54:04.600 --> 1:54:09.960]  dollars i mean we're living in a time obviously a serious financial crisis and how much state
[1:54:09.960 --> 1:54:15.480]  money how much of this federal money is going to states if they have the kind of money to
[1:54:15.480 --> 1:54:20.680]  dig their way on surveilling the chesapeake climate control committee what does that say
[1:54:20.680 --> 1:54:27.640]  about the priorities where our tax dollars are going well i myself as a talk show host have been
[1:54:27.640 --> 1:54:33.080]  surveilled and it's really ham fisted i mean this goes back a decade ago where you'd be at some event
[1:54:33.880 --> 1:54:39.400]  and uh some mainline political deal and somebody walk over and go we need to shoot these politicians
[1:54:39.400 --> 1:54:43.560]  we ought to bomb them and then you follow the person out of the parking lot and be an unmarked
[1:54:43.560 --> 1:54:49.480]  police car i mean it's just so ham fisted the way they try to provocateur yeah no that's right
[1:54:49.480 --> 1:54:56.280]  that's right and it does create its own paranoia as well because um i was in a meeting where we
[1:54:56.280 --> 1:55:01.000]  were talking about this and one person said we have to watch out for that very thing the people
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:06.600]  who come in and they raise all these provocative ideas of the violence and whatnot and then someone
[1:55:06.600 --> 1:55:10.760]  else said yeah but we also have to watch out for people who are very conservative and don't want
[1:55:10.760 --> 1:55:15.720]  us to do anything because that's also how they operate and i said wait a minute you just but
[1:55:15.720 --> 1:55:20.040]  so what so we have to watch out for people who are too wild and then people who aren't wild
[1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:27.640]  who's left i mean you get to this point where anybody who you don't know then becomes a suspect
[1:55:27.640 --> 1:55:33.160]  and that has an absolutely chilling if not crippling effect on people's ability to just
[1:55:33.160 --> 1:55:38.120]  be physically engaged well that's why you just have to obey the laws do the right thing speak up
[1:55:38.120 --> 1:55:43.320]  and and and not cower and hide i mean back during the nineties with militia groups uh they would
[1:55:43.320 --> 1:55:48.600]  immediately get into these paranoid mindsets and start hiding out thinking everybody was after them
[1:55:48.600 --> 1:55:52.840]  and then that was perfect for the feds to come in and actually try to get them to be violent
[1:55:52.840 --> 1:55:57.960]  so they could get more funding i mean it's the same thing on on the left or the right uh all of this
[1:55:57.960 --> 1:56:04.360]  paranoia hiding underneath the uh the desk really feeds into what the feds want uh and it's just
[1:56:04.360 --> 1:56:08.920]  despicable i don't know how they find people that are willing to do this but so you guys in your
[1:56:08.920 --> 1:56:14.840]  meetings though never had anybody try to provocateur that you know of uh back in the day i mean if
[1:56:14.840 --> 1:56:20.920]  you're talking about in the last several years since uh no oh but you did happen several years
[1:56:20.920 --> 1:56:25.240]  but you did before back in the day well we'll stay there stay there back in 60 seconds
[1:56:25.240 --> 1:56:34.120]  thank you for listening to gcn be sure to visit gcnlive.com today
[1:56:36.920 --> 1:56:42.680]  a day unlike any other in the long course of american history a terrorist act of war against
[1:56:42.680 --> 1:56:48.680]  this country the enemies struck america on september 11th but who is the enemy bin laden
[1:56:48.680 --> 1:56:53.000]  this is his ammo we have to look to the middle east we have to look to the soma bin laden
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:57.240]  fabled enemies is the first 9 11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to
[1:56:57.240 --> 1:57:02.040]  intelligence networks inside the united states some u.s investigators believe that there are
[1:57:02.040 --> 1:57:08.840]  israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the u.s i'm aware that uh some israeli
[1:57:08.840 --> 1:57:14.680]  citizens have been detained and laden's connections to the cia the hijackers ties to the fbi the
[1:57:14.680 --> 1:57:19.240]  saudi arabian connection the israeli intelligence network warnings and war games the shadow
[1:57:19.240 --> 1:57:25.240]  government and much much more fabled enemies get the dvd at info wars dot com or see it in
[1:57:25.240 --> 1:57:30.760]  super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prison planet dot tv either you are
[1:57:30.760 --> 1:57:51.000]  with us or you are with the terrorists waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:58.280]  big brother mainstream media government coverups you want answers well so does he
[1:57:58.280 --> 1:58:07.240]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[1:58:10.760 --> 1:58:14.920]  well he's a sports writer that's for a lot of big publications including the nation
[1:58:17.480 --> 1:58:23.240]  they've ensured on his website his edge of sports dot com got links to it up on info wars dot com
[1:58:23.880 --> 1:58:27.480]  and they had a little lot in the death penalty group and by the way whether you agree with that
[1:58:27.480 --> 1:58:31.800]  or disagree with it totally peaceful group historically you don't hear death penalty
[1:58:31.800 --> 1:58:36.840]  groups of hurting anybody i mean it being spied on by the state police with federal funds
[1:58:37.640 --> 1:58:42.920]  and incidentally i am for the death penalty as a moral thing i mean if you catch somebody red
[1:58:42.920 --> 1:58:48.600]  handed killing somebody premeditatedly i think they should die but i'm against the death penalty
[1:58:48.600 --> 1:58:54.440]  because we found over a third of those on death row end up are completely innocent and the system
[1:58:54.440 --> 1:59:00.440]  is so coming when the houston crime lab alone in one year frame four thousand people and some
[1:59:00.440 --> 1:59:08.040]  went to death row in texas uh there's a problem here so but but regardless regardless um
[1:59:09.400 --> 1:59:13.960]  day we were talking about years ago you know you found out about it later were there
[1:59:13.960 --> 1:59:20.680]  feds or state police in your group uh trying to agitate or trying to radicalize you guys
[1:59:20.680 --> 1:59:26.600]  well i'll say two things first of all on the question you just said um i'm in agreement
[1:59:26.600 --> 1:59:31.320]  with you about that i mean i'm not a more a morally i'm not one of the people who's morally
[1:59:31.320 --> 1:59:35.800]  against the death penalty i just think the system itself is so riddled with errors and
[1:59:35.800 --> 1:59:41.320]  problems and biases that it just does not operate effectively in a democratic society
[1:59:42.120 --> 1:59:49.000]  on the second point uh no the people who we know absolutely positively who were plants were spies
[1:59:49.000 --> 1:59:57.720]  were actually the um remarkable like a a young woman who uh just was like a kind faced person
[1:59:57.720 --> 2:00:04.440]  who just asked a lot of very good questions and took copious notes and made sure she was on all
[2:00:04.440 --> 2:00:09.720]  the email lists i mean i have been you know almost a forgettable person i mean i had to
[2:00:09.720 --> 2:00:16.040]  fortunately i never erase any emails and i went back and looked at all the the several dozen emails
[2:00:16.040 --> 2:00:22.520]  she'd sent me over her time in the group and they're so benign and that that's part of i guess what
[2:00:22.520 --> 2:00:30.840]  makes an effective long-term plant but it's also benign we have to remember because her own conclusions
[2:00:30.840 --> 2:00:37.000]  according to the declassified documents was that we weren't doing anything wrong and so and the
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:43.720]  scandal like i said and i can't repeat this enough is that she was sent back in after reporting
[2:00:43.720 --> 2:00:49.080]  that nothing illegal was going on
[2:00:50.040 --> 2:00:55.960]  there's no fact i was just thinking about that uh the case with michael moore where you know he
[2:00:55.960 --> 2:01:00.760]  shows the peace group the anti-war group that bake cookies every week and then they learned
[2:01:00.760 --> 2:01:08.920]  the guy was a police informant because he died in a car wreck uh i mean any gauge on how many spies
[2:01:08.920 --> 2:01:14.840]  just threw that state police program in maryland there are oh we know from the documents that
[2:01:14.840 --> 2:01:20.760]  they they devoted hundreds of of of man and woman hours to spying on groups and you could do a lot
[2:01:20.760 --> 2:01:25.880]  of damage in that time if you think that a typical group at most meets for an hour or two a week
[2:01:26.440 --> 2:01:31.480]  and you think about hundreds of hours that we know about i mean then you're talking about
[2:01:31.480 --> 2:01:37.400]  them really covering a lot of ground and a lot of money going into this as well and then the fact
[2:01:37.400 --> 2:01:43.240]  that i know you played a clip of this off the the racial matters show but the fact that they entered
[2:01:43.240 --> 2:01:51.080]  us into these anti-terror databases and lumped us in within these databases that are incredibly
[2:01:51.080 --> 2:01:56.440]  harmful and who knows what kind of uh access that gives to our personal lives if you happen to be one
[2:01:56.440 --> 2:02:01.720]  of those people in my dad was driving one of my cars i sold it to him and he hadn't changed the
[2:02:01.720 --> 2:02:05.640]  registration over and the cop pulled him over in the middle of nowhere in texas one night like
[2:02:05.640 --> 2:02:09.960]  ten o'clock at night and said and said wait right there for like ten minutes then came up and said
[2:02:09.960 --> 2:02:17.640]  well you're not alex jones and uh and he said he said yeah but uh he said yeah you've got a handle
[2:02:17.640 --> 2:02:25.080]  with care note in my computer system uh you know you're on a uh watch list so now the police departments
[2:02:25.080 --> 2:02:33.800]  are dialing in to these private databases as well were you aware of that no i was not good to know
[2:02:33.800 --> 2:02:37.240]  well once that happened to my dad about six months ago i looked into it and found out that
[2:02:37.240 --> 2:02:42.360]  yeah uh they've got all sorts of databases and a lot of the stuff in them is wrong final segment
[2:02:42.360 --> 2:02:47.640]  with our guests will talk about the influence of sports and politics when we get back hello friends
[2:02:47.640 --> 2:02:52.120]  this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today
[2:02:52.120 --> 2:02:56.520]  that's more important than ever we need to be independent and food and water is the key you'll
[2:02:56.520 --> 2:03:00.440]  never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the
[2:03:00.440 --> 2:03:05.480]  super dome and beg for female to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare
[2:03:05.480 --> 2:03:10.040]  our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for a special interest so they ignored
[2:03:10.040 --> 2:03:14.360]  your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email they voted to print eight
[2:03:14.360 --> 2:03:19.320]  hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the american and european

[2:05:00.600 --> 2:05:12.920]  open phones in the shower at 1-800-259-9331 after our guess it leaves us here about seven eight
[2:05:12.920 --> 2:05:18.600]  minutes got a lot of other news i haven't gotten to yet some interesting developments on the health
[2:05:18.600 --> 2:05:25.720]  front they have now implanted there's a big race to do this in the last month several
[2:05:25.720 --> 2:05:33.560]  artificial grown organs in the human body grown from your own tissue no need to even
[2:05:34.360 --> 2:05:40.600]  use aborted baby parts to do it so that is coming up as well as some interesting news
[2:05:40.600 --> 2:05:46.600]  clips i want to play and comment on too but we're talking to national sports writer right
[2:05:46.600 --> 2:05:52.680]  for the nation and other publications that davis iran's website is edgeofsports.com
[2:05:52.680 --> 2:05:57.640]  my website is of course info wars dot com and prismplanet.com
[2:05:57.640 --> 2:06:03.080]  uh... Dave shifting gears in the time we have left uh... what you're really reporting on now is the
[2:06:03.080 --> 2:06:11.480]  expansion uh... of uh... i mean exponential growth of sports icons and and and sports
[2:06:13.000 --> 2:06:19.000]  legends uh... and just average players also getting involved in politics more and more
[2:06:19.000 --> 2:06:24.200]  a why hadn't they been involved in politics a lot in the past and then b why are they now
[2:06:25.080 --> 2:06:29.880]  why is it becoming more acceptable for them uh... to be involved in the culture
[2:06:31.080 --> 2:06:36.760]  we're getting finally finished with a whole era that i like to think of as the era of michael
[2:06:36.760 --> 2:06:41.560]  jordan and that's not a reference to the great basketball players skills on the court
[2:06:42.120 --> 2:06:48.040]  but his famous statement about why he wouldn't stand up to uh... north carolina senator jesse
[2:06:48.040 --> 2:06:51.320]  elms because he said republicans by sneakers too
[2:06:51.320 --> 2:06:56.440]  i mean it was a statement of a political principle if there is such a thing
[2:06:57.080 --> 2:07:03.160]  and this idea that making money is king and everything else comes in second and so that
[2:07:03.160 --> 2:07:08.120]  has dominated a sports world which is such a huge globalized business by the way i mean i think
[2:07:08.120 --> 2:07:12.760]  that's a very cowardly i'm not attacking michael jordan but that really is a self-centered
[2:07:12.760 --> 2:07:17.720]  mindless comment and the guy's not stupid obviously i mean i mean thinking he's in a bubble
[2:07:17.720 --> 2:07:24.120]  and nothing effecting but go ahead you know that that's exactly the point is that it's a statement
[2:07:24.120 --> 2:07:30.200]  of saying that in a very proud way i could care less about anything that happens in the world i
[2:07:30.200 --> 2:07:37.880]  only care about selling my sneakers and it really did fit in with this huge trillion dollar globalized
[2:07:37.880 --> 2:07:46.200]  sports industry this athletic industrial complex which has become so massive now well that philosophy
[2:07:46.200 --> 2:07:52.360]  dominated a generation you also had a lot of those lesser or middling players who were just frightened
[2:07:52.360 --> 2:07:58.840]  you know who came from poor working class backgrounds they know that the shelf life for a bench player
[2:07:58.840 --> 2:08:03.640]  or role player is only a couple of seasons and you just want to make as much money as you can
[2:08:03.640 --> 2:08:08.920]  and to speak out about politics and risk of that it just seemed foolhardy for a lot of players for
[2:08:08.920 --> 2:08:14.600]  a generation of players to actually risk it but what you're starting to see right now is a bunch
[2:08:14.600 --> 2:08:21.000]  of players taking a different approach and saying wow i have this remarkable platform i have all of
[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:27.800]  this cultural capital if i say something it might actually make some news why don't i try to use it
[2:08:27.800 --> 2:08:33.640]  to try to do some good and that to me is a welcome thing and a lot of people say well who cares
[2:08:33.640 --> 2:08:40.840]  athletes why should i care what they say this is why because jocks are role models whether we
[2:08:40.840 --> 2:08:46.680]  we think of that's a good thing or not that's a question of opinion it's like a warrior it's like
[2:08:46.680 --> 2:08:54.280]  a warrior art type exactly it's a fact that these guys are role models and in my early 20s i was a
[2:08:54.280 --> 2:08:59.080]  school teacher in third grade i can tell you it's deep that these guys are role models well just to
[2:08:59.080 --> 2:09:03.800]  interject something because you're so on target here it's a cop out i mean when we you know have
[2:09:03.800 --> 2:09:09.400]  hollywood people sometimes on this show you know our detractors will say well who cares what they
[2:09:09.400 --> 2:09:15.800]  have to say well then why do why the advertisers hire them you know why why a government officials
[2:09:15.800 --> 2:09:21.800]  love to get stars on board the truth is uh when somebody doesn't like what a star is saying they
[2:09:21.800 --> 2:09:27.320]  play that card of so what what they have to say but bottom line in this in this culture you know
[2:09:27.320 --> 2:09:33.640]  that type of stuff is is king so that's a total cop out but go ahead no i agree i agree but here's
[2:09:33.640 --> 2:09:40.600]  the thing if they're going to be role models and if we all agree also just factually one child born
[2:09:40.600 --> 2:09:46.600]  in a generation is going to be able to hit a 90 mile an hour fastball for a 350 average over a 20
[2:09:46.600 --> 2:09:52.360]  year major league career in other words the odds of becoming a star yourself as a young child are
[2:09:52.360 --> 2:09:57.800]  infinitesimal then you have to ask yourself then well what else are they modeling i mean if they're
[2:09:57.800 --> 2:10:03.240]  modeling that jordan ethos that says well life is about making money and the hell with your
[2:10:03.240 --> 2:10:09.320]  fellow man that's an actual exactly modeling that people will take advantage of exactly not
[2:10:09.320 --> 2:10:14.120]  speaking out of that's a great thought not speaking out is a form of communication right there
[2:10:14.840 --> 2:10:19.080]  it is and it's modeling this is all about role modeling so when these young kids
[2:10:19.080 --> 2:10:23.560]  say it's a chubby short kid who doesn't have a dream in the world of dunking a basketball
[2:10:23.560 --> 2:10:29.400]  and he's going to get his stock his role model lebron james and what he's getting from lebron
[2:10:29.400 --> 2:10:35.640]  james is you know what it matters to think about politics it matters to care about an election it
[2:10:35.640 --> 2:10:41.800]  matters to hold leaders accountable for what they say that's a very different kind of lesson than
[2:10:41.800 --> 2:10:49.000]  hey if you can dunk a basketball and beat six foot eight life is good wow absolutely and and and
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:53.880]  then that's the exact type of message though that corporate america doesn't want they want the
[2:10:53.880 --> 2:10:59.000]  basketball and football and baseball stars to say only care about playing only care about money
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:04.520]  don't believe politically involved but when the heroes start telling the kids hey be real heroes
[2:11:04.520 --> 2:11:09.640]  be involved politically be involved in things that matter be involved in your community that could
[2:11:09.640 --> 2:11:15.640]  actually uh bring back a viable culture oh no we can't have that and that's another interesting
[2:11:15.640 --> 2:11:21.880]  thing about athletes because you know joe demaggio said this 60 years ago he said uh he said rich
[2:11:21.880 --> 2:11:27.160]  boys don't become star pro athletes because you got to have a hunger in your belly to make it
[2:11:27.160 --> 2:11:31.720]  i mean it's a bit of a broad generalization but it is true that even though a lot of these
[2:11:31.720 --> 2:11:35.880]  athletes they've got tons of money they might live in a gated community but it's about where
[2:11:35.880 --> 2:11:41.880]  they come from and so there's a point of relation and a point of connection with uh regular folk
[2:11:41.880 --> 2:11:47.480]  that i think the typical hollywood celebrity just does not have yeah absolutely the new
[2:11:47.480 --> 2:11:54.360]  voracious especially uh they just don't have a fire in the belly they're into you know leisurely
[2:11:54.360 --> 2:11:58.600]  playing golf and screwing around and managing you know their companies they don't have that
[2:11:58.600 --> 2:12:04.760]  fire in the belly that somebody uh who could become a sports champion generally does and when
[2:12:04.760 --> 2:12:10.440]  you know it's whether or not your family gets out of a terrible situation i mean i can tell you
[2:12:10.440 --> 2:12:15.480]  you go down to brooklyn and you know two o'clock in the morning down at coney island you'll see
[2:12:15.480 --> 2:12:22.200]  people dribbling basketballs two hands up and down the court uh maybe with a brick tied around each
[2:12:22.200 --> 2:12:29.800]  ankle to strengthen those muscles i mean it is a monastic sacrificial life that most of them still
[2:12:29.800 --> 2:12:37.480]  don't make it anyway same thing with boxing definitely definitely i mean boxing is one of
[2:12:37.480 --> 2:12:45.080]  the ultimate warrior sport and the sacrifice for becoming a boxer is profound because these young
[2:12:45.080 --> 2:12:50.120]  people aren't stupid they watch hbo real sports they see the documentaries and they know that when
[2:12:50.120 --> 2:12:55.960]  they hit their 40s after a boxing career they might not be speaking in sentences that they their own
[2:12:55.960 --> 2:13:02.520]  mother could understand but it's a sacrifice that they try to make to try to get out of a certain
[2:13:02.520 --> 2:13:09.080]  financial or economic climate and but that's also why athletes have a real sway with young
[2:13:09.080 --> 2:13:14.760]  people with poor kids because it's a because they're like look i've been there and i'm telling you
[2:13:14.760 --> 2:13:20.360]  you know you're you're not going to be in the nba but you could be a thinking person who makes a
[2:13:20.360 --> 2:13:25.320]  difference in this world well i think it's important for these stars to explain that they're not only
[2:13:25.320 --> 2:13:30.040]  valuable because they are a sports star but that there are other things that are frankly even more
[2:13:30.040 --> 2:13:36.040]  important and i think that message from them has been lacking the gang member activity the arrogance
[2:13:36.040 --> 2:13:40.840]  the corruption that certainly the media magnifies and you know loves only focus in on that but that's
[2:13:40.840 --> 2:13:45.960]  had a detrimental effect on our young people and absolutely uh we need to get them salvaged in the
[2:13:45.960 --> 2:13:49.960]  few minutes we've got left with our amazing uh guest we don't normally have sports riders on but
[2:13:50.520 --> 2:13:54.200]  most sports riders don't have homeland security state police spying on them
[2:13:55.560 --> 2:14:01.640]  david drew david xyron just an amazing individual edge of sports dot com
[2:14:03.080 --> 2:14:08.840]  in closing a few minutes on pat tilman i mean that whole thing of him getting sucked in you know
[2:14:08.840 --> 2:14:14.040]  that same you know hero uh warrior attitude he wants to go fight for his country he finds out
[2:14:14.040 --> 2:14:19.640]  afghanistan's a photo op i've talked to his brother uh he finds out it's a scam he dies
[2:14:19.640 --> 2:14:24.840]  mysteriously they cover it up uh you've written a lot about that give us your take on pat tilman
[2:14:25.720 --> 2:14:30.840]  oh that night i spoke with his mother recently as well i mean the pat tilman story is both an
[2:14:30.840 --> 2:14:36.520]  american tragedy and an american crime and we've still yet to see people truly held accountable
[2:14:36.520 --> 2:14:42.680]  for it i think one member of the brass a senior officer got knocked down a peg at like at a star
[2:14:42.680 --> 2:14:47.240]  taken off or something like that but not the real kind of accountability that we need i mean pat
[2:14:47.240 --> 2:14:52.680]  tilman thought he was going to risk his life and die if necessary for his country and for freedom
[2:14:52.680 --> 2:15:00.120]  and instead he died for public relations and that in and of itself is a sin and the family has the
[2:15:00.120 --> 2:15:04.120]  right to know what happened to him the right to know to all the facts the right to know why his
[2:15:04.120 --> 2:15:09.240]  journal was destroyed after he died the right to know why his personal effects were burned on site
[2:15:09.240 --> 2:15:14.760]  and often more than anything else the right to know why their son was exploited in the ruthless
[2:15:14.760 --> 2:15:20.520]  manner that he was in death in a way that in life i would argue pat tilman absolutely would have
[2:15:20.520 --> 2:15:25.560]  rejected you know you offer to go to the bottom of the hour this is too important can you do that
[2:15:25.560 --> 2:15:30.440]  still sure okay let's because we've got a break and come back with a quick segment but get started
[2:15:30.440 --> 2:15:35.240]  now because you've been really close to this case as close as we can you know get to the truth
[2:15:35.240 --> 2:15:40.520]  what really happened with tilman let's do it we've got about a minute now go ahead and get
[2:15:40.520 --> 2:15:47.880]  started oh okay just started now um well one of the things about the case that it is still just
[2:15:47.880 --> 2:15:54.600]  makes me very concerned is the reports upon his death i mean there are there's talks of friendly
[2:15:54.600 --> 2:16:01.560]  fire of chaos the washington post at a painstaking recreation of that last battle where half of this
[2:16:01.560 --> 2:16:06.760]  battalion goes out circles all the way around and then confuses the battalion that remained and
[2:16:06.760 --> 2:16:11.800]  they go after each other and yet once the autopsy results were revealed months and months after
[2:16:11.800 --> 2:16:18.920]  the fact uh he was killed at the shots in the forehead at very close range and it's just it's
[2:16:18.920 --> 2:16:24.920]  hard to square those two stories together i mean on the original death one of the troops even said
[2:16:24.920 --> 2:16:31.560]  that his last words were this can't be f-ing happening to me i'm f-ing pat tilman which
[2:16:31.560 --> 2:16:37.160]  sounded like something out of a movie when i read it at the time but and it turns out there's no way
[2:16:37.160 --> 2:16:40.840]  would have said that if he'd been shot in the forehead that's not that's not what happened
[2:16:41.880 --> 2:16:46.440]  yeah it was a way that it was a way to degrade him and put him down we'll talk about was he
[2:16:46.440 --> 2:16:50.600]  murdered because he was writing letters home and going to come home against the war did they black
[2:16:50.600 --> 2:16:56.120]  off him we'll talk to the man who talked to the family we get back drinking a chlorophyll rich

[2:20:59.880 --> 2:21:05.080]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[2:21:06.680 --> 2:21:11.560]  david zyrton's our guest he's written to the washington post new york daily news new york
[2:21:11.560 --> 2:21:17.400]  news day baltimore stein houston chronicle list goes on and on appears on natural tv does some radio
[2:21:17.400 --> 2:21:22.440]  chubb and he's just written now the people's history of sport sounds like a great book to read
[2:21:23.160 --> 2:21:29.640]  gotta tell you mostly sports writers for me to death and they also don't have the state police
[2:21:29.640 --> 2:21:34.920]  spying on him for no reason that's why he's here but he's also knows the tellments talk to him
[2:21:34.920 --> 2:21:39.400]  written about it expose what's going on yeah i mean they lied over and over again and then
[2:21:39.400 --> 2:21:45.240]  they shot him up close from just a few yards away in the face uh... and i talked to his
[2:21:45.240 --> 2:21:49.320]  brother and others years ago you know he was writing letters home saying he was going to go
[2:21:49.320 --> 2:21:54.680]  public in the time we've got left i mean flushing out the evidence but it in all points towards
[2:21:54.680 --> 2:22:00.680]  a snuff a frag a murder so that he wouldn't come home and be a poster boy against the war
[2:22:01.160 --> 2:22:06.520]  uh... i mean what else could it be or was it some guys that were jealous of him i mean i mean
[2:22:06.520 --> 2:22:09.640]  it it certainly looks like it was not on purpose
[2:22:09.640 --> 2:22:15.640]  it certainly does uh... i mean i spoke at great length with his mom mary and it's her belief in
[2:22:15.640 --> 2:22:19.560]  as much as i've studied this i mean she's somebody who's been over this with a fine tooth
[2:22:19.560 --> 2:22:27.240]  comb because she wants justice for her son and she's convinced that it was the entire tragedy
[2:22:27.240 --> 2:22:33.400]  was uh... a result of the horrible chaos of the moment and then people in a fumbling
[2:22:33.400 --> 2:22:38.280]  bumbling embarrassing way trying to cover it up followed by
[2:22:38.280 --> 2:22:43.320]  a series of you know how the armed forces work with the series of slow bureaucratic
[2:22:44.040 --> 2:22:49.080]  uh... grinding this that just made the entire thing worse every step of the way well i don't
[2:22:49.080 --> 2:22:53.560]  think she knows how to use an m sixteen though the point is he's waving his arms saying stop
[2:22:53.560 --> 2:22:57.880]  shooting and they run up and shooting and then it's all an accident and they cover it up
[2:22:57.880 --> 2:23:03.320]  yeah yeah i know that's that's what i'm saying i mean it there's a lot about that if it doesn't
[2:23:03.320 --> 2:23:10.120]  pass the smell test so you don't agree with them well i mean i i i certainly respect the angle
[2:23:10.120 --> 2:23:19.080]  from which she is taking it um i am very very skeptical about coincidences and for all the
[2:23:19.080 --> 2:23:24.840]  brave men and women who've died overseas we have to remember that only a very small percentage
[2:23:24.840 --> 2:23:31.560]  of the i believe it's over a million troops who've cycled through have actually died and when one
[2:23:31.560 --> 2:23:38.840]  of them happens to be the most famous one and it happens to happen concurrent with the abu
[2:23:38.840 --> 2:23:45.160]  grave photos getting released the worst public relations disaster through the pentagon it's
[2:23:45.160 --> 2:23:51.880]  just i mean i i mean i just wasn't raised to believe in coincidences well he was planning
[2:23:51.880 --> 2:23:57.160]  to go public against the war that's it to his writing letters to people like noam chomsky
[2:23:57.960 --> 2:24:03.720]  he was making a true effort to intellectually come to terms with what was happening with
[2:24:03.720 --> 2:24:07.960]  u.s. foreign policy and that's one of the other things when i say it was an american tragedy
[2:24:07.960 --> 2:24:13.880]  is that he it's hard not to view him as being a microcosm or a representative of the country as a
[2:24:13.880 --> 2:24:21.560]  whole you know angry and gung ho after nine eleven and yet going into a rock and not understanding
[2:24:21.560 --> 2:24:27.480]  of the logic of that and then that being a pretext for him starting to question the broader war on
[2:24:27.480 --> 2:24:33.000]  terror well i mean the way they built him up to a god level and then what would have happened if
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:36.440]  he would have come home and spoke out against the war as he was planning to do i mean they just
[2:24:36.440 --> 2:24:40.840]  couldn't put up with that and then and then all the mysterious things and the different stories
[2:24:40.840 --> 2:24:45.400]  and i'm sorry troops don't run up five feet from me in broad daylight if you're begging and screaming
[2:24:45.400 --> 2:24:51.560]  in english and shoot you in the face i mean come on it's not something i understand to be to be
[2:24:51.560 --> 2:24:56.280]  perfectly fine with you well we know this it became a pr disaster forum one way or the other
[2:24:57.560 --> 2:25:04.680]  it sure did it sure did um but i i really do think though that the twin impact of the abu
[2:25:04.680 --> 2:25:11.720]  grey photos with the death of tilman in a friendly fire situation would have been ridiculous we have
[2:25:11.720 --> 2:25:17.640]  to remember they gave tilman the silver star posthumously posthumously the silver star is only
[2:25:17.640 --> 2:25:24.120]  reserved for death in the theater of active combat it's specifically not reserved for friendly fire
[2:25:24.680 --> 2:25:28.200]  which gives you an idea about the level of cover-up that was involved
[2:25:31.320 --> 2:25:36.280]  well you know that the original army doctors at first saw the body said that uh it looked like
[2:25:36.280 --> 2:25:45.400]  a foul play no yes yes absolutely absolutely yeah so i mean i really do believe this entire
[2:25:45.400 --> 2:25:51.080]  thing is the equivalent of when you see a little uh thread off of a sweater and you pull it
[2:25:51.080 --> 2:25:57.000]  and just the more you pull it the more it unravels well an army doctor who's a forensics investigator
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:02.200]  that's what they look at is battle wounds and they said this looks like it is probably i can
[2:26:02.200 --> 2:26:06.360]  pull up the i'm sure you've seen the form but they might now looks like he was murdered looks like
[2:26:06.360 --> 2:26:11.880]  this was a hit no this this is what we're talking about and you got powder burns on his face i mean
[2:26:11.880 --> 2:26:17.880]  give me a break this is what we're talking about and it's nothing pleasant like i said it's an
[2:26:17.880 --> 2:26:23.880]  american tragedy and an american crime well great talking to you and we appreciate all the work

[2:31:16.520 --> 2:31:22.840]  anderson but no to get serious here you know we're trying to blunt the bad news us home
[2:31:22.840 --> 2:31:30.120]  construction sinks to all-time record low charts predict dow Jones industrial average to go down
[2:31:30.120 --> 2:31:36.040]  to 6 000 points in less than a month that's not just our experts that's cnbc's experts
[2:31:36.040 --> 2:31:42.920]  paulson says none of the bailout goes to american industry and by the way i'm against the bailout
[2:31:42.920 --> 2:31:49.160]  for the car people the automakers but if you're going to give five trillion to offshore banks
[2:31:49.720 --> 2:31:55.320]  to buy up stock that's what they're doing and then i got to pay for it as a taxpayer i'd rather
[2:31:55.320 --> 2:32:00.040]  give it to gm workers making seventy five dollars an hour and by the way all of them don't a very
[2:32:00.040 --> 2:32:08.440]  small percentage do the media uses that so yeah not 25 billion for the automakers we're not going
[2:32:08.440 --> 2:32:13.880]  to make cars there anymore folks we don't make anything nothing for them and it probably wouldn't
[2:32:13.880 --> 2:32:21.880]  save them down the road i don't know what's bad news and i want to bring ted anderson up because
[2:32:21.880 --> 2:32:26.600]  ted the owner of the genesis network and also minus resources 30 years in gold and silver
[2:32:26.600 --> 2:32:32.120]  brokers ted has some of the store closure list now i've got them that are a thousand names
[2:32:32.120 --> 2:32:35.960]  long we're not going to read all these but uh some of the big ones you know it's not just circuit
[2:32:35.960 --> 2:32:41.720]  city and again i i probably got to eat about twice a week when i work late about a third of
[2:32:41.720 --> 2:32:46.600]  the restaurants i try to go to and eat at they're gone ted anderson tells what's going on there
[2:32:46.600 --> 2:32:50.920]  yeah okay i mean obviously circuit city is at the top of the list but you've got an taylor you

[2:33:31.400 --> 2:33:35.960]  one i mean people are thinking about buying gift cards i mean i wouldn't even do that this year
[2:33:35.960 --> 2:33:42.440]  there's just too many stores that are going to be gone kb toys lolls dealers i mean there's a lot
[2:33:42.440 --> 2:33:47.720]  more on the list but i we just don't have time to keep going with that i mean the gm thing is
[2:33:47.720 --> 2:33:54.120]  just one part of the whole segment we're talking about the comics now not having enough gold
[2:33:54.120 --> 2:33:58.600]  to deliver and make good on that's a big deal and we told people about this a month ago now it's
[2:33:58.600 --> 2:34:04.280]  mainstream news as usual we tell you is later news explain that briefly like max keiser did for
[2:34:04.280 --> 2:34:09.800]  those that don't know that the paper gold crowd has been trying to suppress the price of gold but
[2:34:09.800 --> 2:34:13.800]  now people are demanding physical delivery and then of course they don't have it explain that and
[2:34:13.800 --> 2:34:17.720]  then they could shorten it's like the fractional reserve banking system when you're when you're
[2:34:17.720 --> 2:34:23.800]  dealing with the comics most trades close and they and then and the uh and the contracts expire
[2:34:23.800 --> 2:34:28.920]  worthless they don't take delivery they just sell them to the next guy into the next guy until the
[2:34:28.920 --> 2:34:34.040]  time value is gone and then the contract's gone it if you have a contract to buy or sell and if
[2:34:34.040 --> 2:34:38.840]  you don't if you let it expire it means that it goes away and nothing ever happens with it it
[2:34:38.840 --> 2:34:45.320]  same holds true in the uh in the options market but now people are buying the comics contracts
[2:34:45.320 --> 2:34:49.560]  and they're wanting to take delivery and there's just simply not enough gold to do it and so the
[2:34:49.560 --> 2:34:53.720]  physical market itself is reflecting the real prices of gold what's going on because people can buy
[2:34:53.720 --> 2:34:58.360]  a comics for 750 bucks and then they think well i'll just take physical delivery now be able to
[2:34:58.360 --> 2:35:03.640]  sell it for 900 people are paying premiums everywhere and they're saying sorry we don't have the gold
[2:35:03.640 --> 2:35:08.920]  yeah then then you have what's called a force force majeure and uh and the contract settles
[2:35:08.920 --> 2:35:13.000]  and there is no delivery on the gold there's just not enough gold to go around and of course that
[2:35:13.000 --> 2:35:17.880]  market is all smoke and mirrors it's all leverage people are putting in 10 percent of their money
[2:35:17.880 --> 2:35:24.200]  to to leverage you know 100 percent of the deal so 90 percent of it is all loan and i don't wear
[2:35:24.200 --> 2:35:29.400]  the gold's at the leprechaun got it well we're all here obviously accumulating the other thing
[2:35:29.400 --> 2:35:34.680]  to alex's gold is sneaking up inch by inch right now rather than having those big $100
[2:35:34.680 --> 2:35:42.040]  increases in all that volatility gold hit about 710 on its law and today it's seen a high of $7
[2:35:42.600 --> 2:35:51.160]  $764.30 and right now it's up two bucks and it's trading for 740 and what's going to happen is you're
[2:35:51.160 --> 2:35:57.240]  going to see $800 an ounce and it's coming so slowly and so steadily that you hardly hardly
[2:35:57.240 --> 2:36:04.280]  even know what happened look it's real simple they are killing the dollar they decided to do it and so
[2:36:04.920 --> 2:36:08.280]  in the interim they're going to run it up and print as many as they can
[2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:14.440]  and give it to the banks to buy real assets with it and then leave us holding the fiat currency bag
[2:36:14.440 --> 2:36:19.560]  well the reason how do you protect yourself folks you move into silver and gold and you do that from
[2:36:19.560 --> 2:36:25.800]  people that have it in their vault in his little pot of gold you you get it from somebody who gets
[2:36:25.800 --> 2:36:30.840]  it in such bulk that he passes on that huge discount I mean ladies and gentlemen most
[2:36:30.840 --> 2:36:36.200]  gold brokerage houses and outfits that have been around decades they're sold out or they can sell
[2:36:36.200 --> 2:36:43.880]  you one coin at huge 30 40 premiums I've explained this explain this you are crazy if you don't buy
[2:36:43.880 --> 2:36:47.640]  some silver and gold and I'm not saying you're at all your stocks all your bonds you know
[2:36:47.640 --> 2:36:54.520]  diversification is always king but for friends for family you know for children it's great to
[2:36:54.520 --> 2:36:59.160]  give them a you know some silver some gold you know to have them lock it up in a safe or
[2:36:59.160 --> 2:37:03.640]  you know have them put it in the mattress whatever it's a great gift to teach people about real
[2:37:03.640 --> 2:37:09.800]  money with this Christmas season coming up but regardless give your children the gift of of
[2:37:09.800 --> 2:37:17.240]  having some nest egg I mean Ted if you google you know congress looks at at taking over pension
[2:37:17.240 --> 2:37:22.840]  funds or taxing pension funds in 401ks I mean they're really getting ready to go after those
[2:37:22.840 --> 2:37:27.640]  Ted no they sure are and they have to do it because they have to step up and they have to bail
[2:37:27.640 --> 2:37:32.040]  out just about everything that it has trouble and where the where do you suppose are coming up with
[2:37:32.040 --> 2:37:36.280]  all this money you know I mean it's all printed money and they're gonna yeah they want to take
[2:37:36.280 --> 2:37:43.240]  control they really want to get people you know in the in the grasp of of government and big
[2:37:43.240 --> 2:37:48.760]  government is coming and it's and it's not only just our current government elected officials
[2:37:48.760 --> 2:37:53.480]  but it's the banking institutions that are meeting like this g this g40 meeting that we
[2:37:53.480 --> 2:37:59.800]  just heard the g20 meeting we just had you know it it looks really really gloomy out there and
[2:37:59.800 --> 2:38:04.200]  as a matter of fact the reason why gold ran up today is because the mid-eastern countries
[2:38:04.200 --> 2:38:08.280]  were deciding that they wanted to get out of the u.s. dollar and they're going to switch it into
[2:38:08.280 --> 2:38:16.120]  gold and that's right um I ran three days ago on 75 billion of their reserves pulled it out of the
[2:38:16.120 --> 2:38:23.000]  U.S. and bought gold and then shipped it to Tehran so Venezuela and others are doing the same thing
[2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:29.560]  and now they have former CIA employee Zahari threatens America again uh you know saying they're
[2:38:29.560 --> 2:38:34.680]  going to bomb us to show Barack Obama all that'll do is let up Barack Obama become more popular
[2:38:34.680 --> 2:38:38.440]  and attack more countries which is why the globalists are going to attack themselves
[2:38:38.440 --> 2:38:42.120]  this is really shaping up to be crazy Ted I'm going to move on to the calls I appreciate you
[2:38:42.120 --> 2:38:47.160]  coming on but briefly uh you still have a few maple leaves you almost sold out of those I know
[2:38:47.800 --> 2:38:51.320]  uh the folks you can't find those anywhere uh you've got all different sizes of american
[2:38:51.320 --> 2:38:56.840]  eagles which again you can't find anywhere uh you've got frank she's got sovereigns uh you've
[2:38:56.840 --> 2:39:01.560]  even got some collectible coins as well but everybody knows I like these bullion coins or
[2:39:01.560 --> 2:39:08.040]  collector coins close to bullion again Ted bought a whole bunch of these back when gold was 50 bucks
[2:39:08.040 --> 2:39:12.440]  cheaper and so you can still pass that on though I talked to you this morning you are running out
[2:39:12.440 --> 2:39:18.280]  of these deals Ted how long until you've exhausted your little pot of gold there that you bought
[2:39:18.280 --> 2:39:22.920]  when gold was a lot lower how long till it has to go up well I know this Alex I know I can hold
[2:39:22.920 --> 2:39:29.080]  the prices today and I can see the prices jumping up in the marketplace too I mean it's 764 if it
[2:39:29.080 --> 2:39:33.960]  holds there my prices are going to have to come up too I mean I did I locked in on a lot of stuff
[2:39:33.960 --> 2:39:39.000]  the people are buying it I really appreciate the business that they're giving us now obviously helps
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:45.080]  the network immensely but I can tell you right now uh I only can do so much you know I'm buying
[2:39:45.080 --> 2:39:50.600]  what I can I mean I knew when gold was at 710 it was a buy I just you know I picked up as much
[2:39:50.600 --> 2:39:54.440]  inventory as I could yeah bottom line folks it's only going to go up I mean all the conventional
[2:39:54.440 --> 2:39:59.400]  wisdom says that who knows but the point is buy it now we can still pass on these huge savings
[2:39:59.400 --> 2:40:03.160]  uh and Ted you've still got all the coins I mentioned and the silver right the same prices
[2:40:03.160 --> 2:40:08.280]  actually I got a $11 discount on Frank's right now I've got about a $22 discount on British
[2:40:08.280 --> 2:40:13.320]  sovereigns I have the silver dollars they are the silver walking Liberty half dollars and
[2:40:13.320 --> 2:40:18.440]  they're currently right now at 890 the dollar the silver dollars are at 25 it's way more than
[2:40:18.440 --> 2:40:23.640]  double the price uh you know we've got a good variety of stuff things to pick from and I would
[2:40:23.640 --> 2:40:29.400]  suggest that you do it now because there's a lot of problems out there and let's explain silver
[2:40:29.400 --> 2:40:34.600]  is down at 14 bucks or whatever it is right now and then the silver dollars everywhere 25 bucks
[2:40:34.600 --> 2:40:39.480]  again that shows the manipulation of not just gold but the silver market so Ted isn't even selling
[2:40:39.480 --> 2:40:43.320]  you silver dollars he just he wants to give you he has half dollars that are right down there by
[2:40:43.320 --> 2:40:50.760]  melt beautiful gorgeous coins that even have some collector value uh so 800 686 2237 800
[2:40:50.760 --> 2:40:57.640]  686 2237 let's go out of this segment and into your phone calls with Ted Anderson's
[2:40:57.640 --> 2:41:06.600]  new theme song here is Ted singing I want to know where the gold at again 800 686 2237
[2:41:06.600 --> 2:41:12.120]  and the brokers are generally there till midnight last night I know they left at about
[2:41:13.080 --> 2:41:22.600]  10 last night but they are there in the evenings 800 686 2237 take advantage of this today 800 686

[2:41:35.800 --> 2:41:43.480]  or minusresources.com okay you want to know where the gold's at it's right there with Ted Anderson
[2:41:43.480 --> 2:41:50.680]  1800 686 2237 okay uh all right got some big guests coming up but I want to take your phone
[2:41:50.680 --> 2:41:56.920]  calls right now to appreciate you holding Paul in the Netherlands welcome Paul hello Alex
[2:41:56.920 --> 2:42:06.040]  hello hey hey I know where the gold is I got really lucky here in the Netherlands it's really
[2:42:06.040 --> 2:42:14.120]  odd because there's this uh gold shop as it were near Amsterdam and they're actually selling the
[2:42:14.120 --> 2:42:21.720]  gold at the actual price that's official it's it's not it's just a company and they don't
[2:42:21.720 --> 2:42:27.480]  put any interest in on it it's just crazy yeah what they do is they again they buy it when it's low
[2:42:27.480 --> 2:42:32.360]  and then they sell it when it's high and always have that set back and yeah there are Europe is
[2:42:32.360 --> 2:42:37.960]  where Ted's getting his gold I mean it's it's it's it's hard to get here in the US it's really cheap
[2:42:37.960 --> 2:42:45.080]  I got I got an embarrassing a lot of it and I got really lucky because now it's starting to
[2:42:45.080 --> 2:42:50.600]  run out over here too oh really it's running out well do you have a little a little pot of gold now
[2:42:51.720 --> 2:43:02.680]  yeah I I got I got the gold I love it yeah it's pretty nice also kind of useful because
[2:43:02.680 --> 2:43:09.160]  even if the prices stay low I'm a goldsmith so I I could always use it oh good sir in that
[2:43:09.160 --> 2:43:15.880]  business I just got lucky anyway so we have a leprechaun calling go ahead and that's the secret
[2:43:15.880 --> 2:43:23.400]  we're all really leprechauns yeah sort of anyways go ahead my friend three subjects I wanted to
[2:43:23.400 --> 2:43:31.880]  talk about and try to get through them as quickly as possible okay the first to start off with is
[2:43:31.880 --> 2:43:39.480]  something about entertainment and I mean movies have you ever heard of the the series firefly of
[2:43:39.480 --> 2:43:45.400]  the movie that got out of it the serenity oh it's excellent yeah it's total anti-new world order
[2:43:45.400 --> 2:43:50.920]  yeah it's the government is putting crozak into the atmosphere to make you serve their world government
[2:43:51.560 --> 2:43:57.000]  and yeah it's all total anti-new world order I can really recommend it to everyone and
[2:43:57.000 --> 2:44:03.560]  box the producer they even just cut the series down after what was it two seasons because
[2:44:03.560 --> 2:44:09.000]  there was only one season and they wouldn't let the other shows air even though it got high ratings
[2:44:09.000 --> 2:44:13.160]  and then so the producer went and made his own movie he's the guy that I forget he's got a bunch
[2:44:13.160 --> 2:44:19.160]  of tv shows like buffy the vampire slayer and all that he's the creator of serenity and that's the
[2:44:19.160 --> 2:44:24.280]  movie the tv show is firefly yeah I don't I mean I don't get into a lot of popular culture but I
[2:44:24.280 --> 2:44:33.560]  uh I saw that movie and liked it enough to go buy the tv show on dvd and uh yeah yeah that's great
[2:44:33.560 --> 2:44:40.840]  okay well let's go to second subject the carbon tax thing because you know if they're actually
[2:44:40.840 --> 2:44:45.960]  gonna pull it through and everyone's gonna pay carbon tax for their own breathing and for the
[2:44:45.960 --> 2:44:53.880]  fuels and their cars and everything and electricity well I was thinking there's a lot of hydrogen
[2:44:53.880 --> 2:45:01.000]  technology out of out there and me and my friends are working on several projects on how to really
[2:45:01.000 --> 2:45:07.320]  make hydrogen gases really cheaply and not very dangerous and using it to create electricity
[2:45:07.320 --> 2:45:13.880]  using it to generate propulsion for cars and everything oh yeah there are all sorts of of
[2:45:13.880 --> 2:45:20.680]  clean systems it just takes a massive investment to bring it out to general market but it's not
[2:45:20.680 --> 2:45:27.000]  actually that hard to make because you could practically put a big can of water in your car
[2:45:27.880 --> 2:45:34.280]  put a hydrogen generator in the next to it and then use it and drive for
[2:45:36.120 --> 2:45:41.240]  indefinitely just you could you could go anywhere and it's it's not hard I know but see
[2:45:41.240 --> 2:45:46.280]  hydrogen is very explosive as you know and I appreciate your call hydrogen is very explosive
[2:45:46.280 --> 2:45:50.280]  and so they have all these regulations on it so they're going to use phony environmentalism
[2:45:50.280 --> 2:45:55.640]  as a way to suppress all of that but what I meant was getting it to roll out and retrofitted
[2:45:55.640 --> 2:46:00.600]  for the general public you see it's going to end up being some huge factory delivered system
[2:46:00.600 --> 2:46:06.680]  instead of lots of local shops doing it but yeah no no innovation one thing about the the economy
[2:46:06.680 --> 2:46:10.440]  imploding is it is going to cause a lot of grassroots innovation good to hear from you
[2:46:10.440 --> 2:46:16.200]  Paul could talk to you for hours but want to give everybody a chance here Ivan in Pennsylvania you're
[2:46:16.200 --> 2:46:26.040]  on the air Ivan dropped off Vinnie in California hey Alex I know where to go there where is it
[2:46:27.400 --> 2:46:32.760]  my safe and buried under my house good yeah I got I got uh I love you I love your show
[2:46:33.320 --> 2:46:36.760]  you know I want to thank you for all the work that you've done just an incredible job sometimes
[2:46:36.760 --> 2:46:40.280]  when I think you're smoking something funny I go and I do my own research and find out that you
[2:46:40.280 --> 2:46:46.920]  were right I got two questions I'm planning to let me get them both in number one on on Chemtrail
[2:46:46.920 --> 2:46:51.080]  there's a have you heard of the black line I sent Aaron a picture of it a while back you know what
[2:46:51.080 --> 2:46:57.880]  that is no it's called the black line yeah it's called the black line I sent Aaron a picture and
[2:46:58.600 --> 2:47:02.520]  what it is is I've noticed it when I was in Indianapolis I live in Southern California
[2:47:02.520 --> 2:47:06.520]  and we know we saw him spraying and then as soon as the spray stopped you can see a black
[2:47:06.520 --> 2:47:11.720]  continuation of the line it just happened instantly almost like it was a track or or
[2:47:11.720 --> 2:47:15.800]  like an exhausting but it was way too fast I mean you'd have to go hyperspeed in order to get
[2:47:15.800 --> 2:47:18.920]  get it to finish but if you could take a look at that when you get a chance I sent it to Aaron
[2:47:18.920 --> 2:47:24.600]  it's like they're energizing it with their antenna arrays of the no now I know what a black line is
[2:47:24.600 --> 2:47:29.560]  people have witnessed these being energized changing colors I've seen it and the government
[2:47:29.560 --> 2:47:34.520]  admits and now and declassify that they spray aerosols and then they energize them with these
[2:47:34.520 --> 2:47:45.160]  ground antennas in in secret projects so yes they're using radio systems to who knows what
[2:47:45.160 --> 2:47:49.640]  they're doing a lot of it's declassified but only that they're doing secret tests anything else you
[2:47:49.640 --> 2:47:55.720]  want to add there stay there Vinnie stay there Vinnie and then Wayne and Adam and Troy the day
[2:47:55.720 --> 2:48:02.040]  unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist act of war against this country
[2:48:02.040 --> 2:48:08.440]  the enemy struck america on september 11th but who is the enemy bin Laden this is his ammo we have
[2:48:08.440 --> 2:48:12.680]  to look to the middle east we have to look to his home of bin Laden fabled enemies is the first

[2:48:23.320 --> 2:48:30.120]  in and on the u.s. I'm aware that some israeli citizens have been detained in laden's connections

[2:54:26.200 --> 2:54:31.640]  obama uh the first one anybody can take it however they want but do you think that the
[2:54:31.640 --> 2:54:37.640]  rainbow coalition and the nblacp are gonna place undue stress and pressure on the government and
[2:54:37.640 --> 2:54:45.400]  the people of america now that obama is a president uh do i think they're gonna do what okay i'm
[2:54:45.400 --> 2:54:51.480]  misunderstood you what are they gonna do what are you asking uh do you feel that the nblacp
[2:54:51.480 --> 2:54:55.960]  and the rainbow coalition are gonna place undue stress so i'm not on the government and the
[2:54:55.960 --> 2:55:02.280]  people of america now that obama's elected president how are they gonna do that okay i
[2:55:02.280 --> 2:55:10.120]  understand the question go ahead um the second uh the second question is uh in regards to the
[2:55:10.120 --> 2:55:15.480]  auto industry do you think uh that they have to allow the bailout or are they just uh simply
[2:55:15.480 --> 2:55:21.320]  going to allow the big three to go bankrupt so that the that the banking uh coalition in europe
[2:55:21.320 --> 2:55:29.640]  can drain out all the uh funds and and what's the last question uh the last question is uh

[2:57:30.120 --> 2:57:37.480]  we had to have a great record and professor steven jones on together i thought that would
[2:57:37.480 --> 2:57:43.080]  be interesting to have them on both together the balance of the hour trying to answer your
[2:57:43.080 --> 2:57:50.600]  questions with your calls adam throw a job we'll get to all of you one way or the other
[2:57:50.600 --> 2:58:04.920]  but to answer the question about the rainbow coalition jesse jackson all those groups
[2:58:05.480 --> 2:58:10.840]  they're going to be thrown to the back of the bus by barack obama you know he'll go speak to
[2:58:10.840 --> 2:58:19.720]  their groups but that's about it obama isn't going to want to upset uh you know lily white america
[2:58:19.720 --> 2:58:25.160]  uh too much with all of that it in fact that's why they want a black president the new world order
[2:58:25.160 --> 2:58:31.640]  is so they can carry out all of this corruption carry out squeezing of the poor it's called left
[2:58:31.640 --> 2:58:39.400]  cover and so now he can warm longer and spy and do everything but the left you'll just can't
[2:58:39.400 --> 2:58:46.360]  criticize a black guy and so it means they can move the ball on the field i don't know what's
[2:58:46.360 --> 2:58:51.560]  going to happen with the big uh three automakers they'll probably just get bought up or merged
[2:58:51.560 --> 2:58:58.680]  with toyota you know nissan dotson uh some of the other companies german companies you know
[2:58:58.680 --> 2:59:07.880]  damlar christler uh they're going to get reorganized um 25 billion 50 billion it's not going to
[2:59:07.880 --> 2:59:15.720]  bail them out the the real economy is dying by design we were put in this position the bankers
[2:59:15.720 --> 2:59:19.320]  everything they could to kill the economy then they cut the credit off so
[2:59:24.600 --> 2:59:30.200]  so i i think you'll end up having some smaller bailout in the interim but but again i don't
[2:59:30.200 --> 2:59:34.280]  have a crystal ball usually when you think i'm predicting something i'm only reading what the
[2:59:34.280 --> 2:59:39.800]  globalists have said they're going to do we have articles up on prisonplanet.com right now where
[2:59:39.800 --> 2:59:43.400]  they openly admit global warming is fake they're going to use it to enslave us i mean
[2:59:46.360 --> 2:59:50.040]  they admit they're building femicamps and they admit they want our guns i mean i'm only covering
[2:59:50.040 --> 2:59:55.240]  what they say they're going to do they aren't being very clear on the auto bailout right now
[2:59:55.960 --> 3:00:00.920]  uh it looks like they're not going to do it but they still could but what will that do
[3:00:01.480 --> 3:00:04.760]  put off the inevitable for a year or two um
[3:00:04.760 --> 3:00:11.320]  um so i hope that answers your question sir let's go ahead and jam in another call here right
[3:00:11.320 --> 3:00:21.640]  now let's go ahead and talk to uh is it adam in texas adam you're only here go ahead well hi
[3:00:22.440 --> 3:00:29.240]  hi man uh i i know your show and i know pretty much that you you've got generally the same
[3:00:29.240 --> 3:00:37.400]  ideas as myself and and a lot of americans um but man i i've been doing so much research and
[3:00:38.360 --> 3:00:44.280]  i'm just getting to the point where i'm trying to figure out exactly what we need to do uh as
[3:00:44.280 --> 3:00:49.480]  americans to wake up other americans and be like look these things are there they're here
[3:00:50.360 --> 3:00:55.720]  you know how what do you what do you think is the best thing that we can do we need individuals
[3:00:55.720 --> 3:01:02.040]  to pull all sorts of stunts let's say you own a printing company put out a fake you know with
[3:01:02.040 --> 3:01:08.040]  a thousand copies or ten thousand copy newspaper your local paper get the same type set make it
[3:01:08.040 --> 3:01:13.480]  look the same and then write up a little blurbs with real information in it and then that will end
[3:01:13.480 --> 3:01:19.320]  up being on all your local news about that stunt and then those issues that are in the
[3:01:19.320 --> 3:01:25.960]  article will get out same thing just happened in new york or micro fm's as long as you're
[3:01:25.960 --> 3:01:30.120]  interfering with the commercial station and as long as people are quiet about it just put them
[3:01:30.120 --> 3:01:35.480]  up and let them be there uh people won't even know where it's coming from have a local micro fm
[3:01:35.480 --> 3:01:40.520]  you know carry genesis network or you know whatever you want uh and put out the truth
[3:01:40.520 --> 3:01:46.680]  that way on the fm dial access tv making copies of films emailing your own email list with films
[3:01:46.680 --> 3:01:50.920]  talking to your neighbors talking to your church just just every look people have this image that
[3:01:50.920 --> 3:01:56.280]  we have to all fix everything ourselves individually no it's all of us doing a little something
[3:01:57.480 --> 3:02:04.280]  and i mean does that answer your question uh to to an extent uh i also had another question
[3:02:04.280 --> 3:02:08.600]  for you and i i haven't listened too much so i don't know if you've already talked about this
[3:02:08.600 --> 3:02:14.840]  do you know much about like planet s and it's not real it's not real uh you know what i'm
[3:02:14.840 --> 3:02:18.120]  gonna put you on hold during breaks i'm gonna be taking calls just for the internet audience
[3:02:18.760 --> 3:02:20.760]  stay with us i'll answer your question in the next break
[3:02:22.360 --> 3:02:26.360]  hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important to be
[3:02:26.360 --> 3:02:30.520]  self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent and food
[3:02:30.520 --> 3:02:35.000]  and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll
[3:02:35.000 --> 3:02:39.800]  never have to go to the super dome and beg for fema to take care of your family in any emergency
[3:02:39.800 --> 3:02:44.200]  if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for a special
[3:02:44.200 --> 3:02:48.600]  interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email
[3:02:48.600 --> 3:02:54.280]  they voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the american
[3:02:54.280 --> 3:02:59.320]  and european banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to
[3:02:59.320 --> 3:03:05.240]  nothing and blast the cost of assassins particularly food beyond many americans reach in pre-nazi
[3:03:05.240 --> 3:03:09.880]  germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached
[3:03:09.880 --> 3:03:15.480]  over 4 billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end
[3:03:15.480 --> 3:03:20.040]  in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores
[3:03:20.040 --> 3:03:25.000]  enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack of prices to stay in business
[3:03:25.000 --> 3:03:30.120]  whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food
[3:03:30.120 --> 3:03:34.440]  one third of americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my
[3:03:34.440 --> 3:03:39.400]  friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there
[3:03:39.400 --> 3:03:43.240]  listening it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storeable food the
[3:03:43.240 --> 3:03:47.880]  government the new old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of
[3:03:47.880 --> 3:03:52.440]  self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation
[3:03:52.440 --> 3:03:57.480]  but you you know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storeable food that's safe from ecoli

[3:05:36.200 --> 3:05:40.920]  something a little different i mean obviously i could have one of them on for 10 hours they've
[3:05:40.920 --> 3:05:47.320]  got so much knowledge of peace but we've got david ray griffin on with physics professor
[3:05:47.320 --> 3:05:54.680]  uh steven jones together and they're both big 9-11 truthers and so i thought well originally
[3:05:54.680 --> 3:06:02.440]  i was going to have them on for this hour because national geographic wanted to interview me and
[3:06:02.440 --> 3:06:07.880]  others about 9-11 truth and then i found out that the guy that was doing the pieces this ericsson
[3:06:07.880 --> 3:06:13.880]  is a specializes in hit pieces on the jfk assassination on other and i and i watched some
[3:06:13.880 --> 3:06:17.640]  of his programs and let me tell you i've never seen anything like it so i did want to be a kind
[3:06:17.640 --> 3:06:25.240]  of a cardboard cutout in a stacked deck i i think griffin and jones are still being interviewed for
[3:06:25.240 --> 3:06:29.320]  it but they were going to be here today and i saw the program you know inside the shooter car this
[3:06:29.320 --> 3:06:34.120]  sunday you made for discovery and i mean it was ridiculous it was ridiculous i mean bottom line
[3:06:34.120 --> 3:06:38.760]  they admit they tore up the chrysler took it apart to hid the evidence took it away witnesses
[3:06:38.760 --> 3:06:45.240]  had their bullet holes all over it in the windshield none of that and a parade of spooks telling us that
[3:06:45.240 --> 3:06:50.040]  oswald did it alone and and i just said you know what i just don't want to be around these people
[3:06:50.040 --> 3:06:57.080]  and they're like but you don't want to be on tv no i don't care uh so um that said i've never
[3:06:57.080 --> 3:07:01.720]  turned down an interview but i you know what i when it's this bad i just am not going to be
[3:07:01.720 --> 3:07:07.080]  part of it uh bringing that subject up let's go to david ray griffin first briefly david i guess
[3:07:07.080 --> 3:07:12.600]  you're still going to be interviewed by these guys well it's still it is scheduled but it's
[3:07:12.600 --> 3:07:21.880]  up in the air and uh you know i felt the the the show they did on 9 11 was uh pretty horrible
[3:07:22.600 --> 3:07:30.360]  and you know they um excuse me i'm i'm i'm mixing with the jfk the history channel did that
[3:07:30.360 --> 3:07:37.400]  yeah and uh and i haven't seen enough of the national geographic the one show i turned down
[3:07:37.400 --> 3:07:45.480]  was the second bbc show uh which was on world trade center seven and ceo and went ahead and went on
[3:07:45.480 --> 3:07:50.920]  that one and i'm glad he did because he was able to get in a lot of good points as did richard gauge
[3:07:51.720 --> 3:07:57.160]  and you know they said well that show was going to be better it indeed was better than the original
[3:07:57.160 --> 3:08:04.920]  bbc show on the towers but it was still uh full of lies and and mainly the big lie about barry
[3:08:04.920 --> 3:08:10.600]  jennings timeline which they totally took out of con okay we're going to go over that and i'm glad
[3:08:10.600 --> 3:08:15.400]  that's why you're here today and i was originally just have you talk about 9 11 evidence okay i
[3:08:15.400 --> 3:08:21.000]  agreed to do bbc and that was a hit piece and was twisted but let me tell you they at least acted like
[3:08:21.000 --> 3:08:28.200]  they were getting our side this guy this ericsson if you watch the uh the jfk shooter car inside the
[3:08:28.200 --> 3:08:35.800]  shooter car completely one-sided i have never seen a hit piece even approaching this so
[3:08:35.800 --> 3:08:39.400]  a word to the wise is sufficient to you and professor jones both of the other professors
[3:08:40.360 --> 3:08:45.880]  and uh so i mean believe me i don't just back out of so i mean i'm not afraid of going up against
[3:08:45.880 --> 3:08:55.640]  somebody uh but you mean if if i know that that that that their specialty uh is uh this type of
[3:08:55.640 --> 3:08:59.720]  intellectual quackery that i'm not going to be part of it so just a heads up let's bring
[3:08:59.720 --> 3:09:06.600]  steven jones up speaking of that uh last uh bbc hit piece uh what did you think of that professor
[3:09:06.600 --> 3:09:14.520]  jones well i want to talk about bbc but also the national geographic interview that i have already
[3:09:14.520 --> 3:09:23.400]  had actually alex last week so i'm starting with bbc like say i was able to get a few points in
[3:09:24.040 --> 3:09:35.080]  i was very disappointed in their headline that came out um before the preliminary report from
[3:09:35.880 --> 3:09:42.680]  nift and that was that uh the will trade center seven's history has been solved well you know
[3:09:42.680 --> 3:09:48.520]  it's solved so they get the report until we have a chance to respond and and review what they said
[3:09:48.520 --> 3:09:54.200]  so yeah overall the the piece was basically a piece but like david said we were able to get
[3:09:54.200 --> 3:09:59.240]  a few points across which i was uh very gratified that we were able to get some truth out through
[3:09:59.240 --> 3:10:05.880]  that uh medium i think it's very important that we continue to reach people through the media even
[3:10:05.880 --> 3:10:11.320]  if they're not entirely friendly to us you know it gives us a chance to reach uh people then they
[3:10:11.320 --> 3:10:17.560]  can get online and learn more now alex i would like to say about this robert erickson i was
[3:10:17.560 --> 3:10:24.600]  interviewed by him last week let's see it would be thursday and frankly i thought his questions
[3:10:24.600 --> 3:10:31.400]  were very fair um i don't think i gave him a lot of ammunition to do a hit piece because
[3:10:32.680 --> 3:10:38.200]  i was very circumspect in my answers there there was a question there are a lot of questions about
[3:10:38.200 --> 3:10:46.360]  the um iron technical details the best of nine eleven which i was just very pleased to answer
[3:10:46.360 --> 3:10:51.800]  and frankly he seemed quite interested so i don't know if this will be different from the jfk i
[3:10:51.800 --> 3:10:59.960]  suspect it will well what they do is they do they know with crop circles uh with uh other jfk
[3:10:59.960 --> 3:11:07.960]  events they do specific little scientific test and and then they say case closed oswald alone
[3:11:07.960 --> 3:11:12.680]  you know shot him from behind so i i mean i'm not saying you're bad for doing the interview
[3:11:12.680 --> 3:11:16.520]  i'm glad you did it i'm just saying look out i also kept asking him what do you want to interview
[3:11:16.520 --> 3:11:22.280]  me about send me questions and they wouldn't give me the questions uh so that's the main reason but
[3:11:22.280 --> 3:11:27.560]  let's get into the latest bbc piece with david ray griffin and then and then and then professor
[3:11:27.560 --> 3:11:33.000]  jones come in uh you know with your own points on the science as a physicist dealing with this
[3:11:33.000 --> 3:11:40.120]  of a professor griffin uh breaking down the latest bbc piece saying we solved building seven uh and
[3:11:40.120 --> 3:11:45.000]  uh you know this is why it happened uh break that down for folks shut the the distortions
[3:11:46.680 --> 3:11:53.640]  well partly they're they're basing it on what they assumed uh nist was going to say
[3:11:54.520 --> 3:11:59.880]  the nist report and the the report of the national institute of standards and technology
[3:11:59.880 --> 3:12:04.680]  which wasn't out yet but they clearly were talking with them and had a pretty good idea
[3:12:05.240 --> 3:12:11.960]  what they were going to say and one thing nist had done was to distort the timeline of very
[3:12:11.960 --> 3:12:20.520]  jennings and michael heth as you know and most of your listeners know uh jennings very clearly
[3:12:20.520 --> 3:12:26.360]  said that he went he and hess went into the world trade center building seven very early
[3:12:26.360 --> 3:12:31.800]  right after the first strike so they were up there by about nine o'clock he's certain he was there
[3:12:31.800 --> 3:12:39.080]  at 903 when the second strike on the south tower occurred and shortly thereafter they they went
[3:12:39.080 --> 3:12:45.240]  down the stairs uh the elevator wouldn't work and jennings said he was on the bbc show he said
[3:12:45.240 --> 3:12:50.920]  he was going to landing at a time and so they were going down very fast so that means they would
[3:12:50.920 --> 3:12:57.960]  have gotten down to the sixth floor by about 9 10 or 9 15 at the latest and there was this huge
[3:12:57.960 --> 3:13:03.000]  explosion they went back up to the eighth floor broke a window jennings said i looked out and both
[3:13:03.560 --> 3:13:10.520]  towers were still standing so what the beat the nist said uh well these two guys were in there
[3:13:11.240 --> 3:13:17.080]  and uh they they uh there was a big event but it was just the north tower coming down well of
[3:13:17.080 --> 3:13:25.160]  course that was not 10 28 which is over an hour later and uh hess remained silent of course all
[3:13:25.160 --> 3:13:34.840]  those years and uh then as soon as uh jennings dies the bbc uh interviews hess and hess is three
[3:13:35.400 --> 3:13:41.160]  you know freely does an interview now and of course tells this new story and tells the timeline
[3:13:41.720 --> 3:13:44.680]  and interestingly uh of course hess is still alive
[3:13:44.680 --> 3:13:55.480]  uh also also on record here uh he went on fox tv he went on other news channels right after the
[3:13:55.480 --> 3:14:01.000]  towers had collapsed and he's on tape talking about how he quickly got out of the building uh
[3:14:01.000 --> 3:14:06.920]  and and then how the towers collapsed so clearly on record bbc and everybody knows
[3:14:06.920 --> 3:14:12.680]  that that was a very short time frame not three hours so we're seeing massive deception right
[3:14:12.680 --> 3:14:19.080]  there on its face uh we know that that hess was being interviewed uh half mile away before noon
[3:14:20.120 --> 3:14:27.320]  probably 11 34 but at least before noon and uh in this claim they didn't even get rescued until
[3:14:27.320 --> 3:14:34.200]  10 after 12 or 10 or 15 minutes after 12 so we know they're lying about that i don't think hess
[3:14:34.200 --> 3:14:37.880]  i didn't hear him say anything about the towers coming down but what he did say
[3:14:37.880 --> 3:14:44.600]  was that he there was a big explosion and now he's changed the story and he says well yeah i
[3:14:44.600 --> 3:14:49.240]  thought there was an explosion at the time but now i realized it was just the north tower coming
[3:14:49.240 --> 3:14:53.480]  down well the way the program implied it i mean they don't state anything in these accepted pieces
[3:14:53.480 --> 3:14:58.200]  was that it was the towers falling and and and then they you know got them out of the building
[3:14:58.200 --> 3:15:02.760]  after the towers had fallen i mean that's the point i'm making is they imply the explosions
[3:15:02.760 --> 3:15:09.240]  are the towers falling that's right now steven jones particularly gets into the science itself
[3:15:10.440 --> 3:15:15.480]  what did you think about the science they were putting out in that piece well um
[3:15:16.040 --> 3:15:22.040]  i've been disappointed you know what they did there uh let me tell some background alexa
[3:15:22.040 --> 3:15:28.520]  about the time they interviewed me we were finishing up our 14 points paper which is
[3:15:28.520 --> 3:15:34.360]  published in the open civil engineering journal so people can google on that or go to journal
[3:15:34.360 --> 3:15:40.200]  in 911studies.com and it's right at the top of the link to this paper in an established journal
[3:15:40.200 --> 3:15:48.520]  so point 11 there i discussed with the folks from bbc uh which has to do with the steel
[3:15:48.520 --> 3:15:54.200]  recovered from the site of world trade center seven that just looks like swiss cheese i don't
[3:15:54.200 --> 3:16:03.480]  know if you've seen the photos but uh it's heavily corroded and shows sulfur inside the steel
[3:16:04.440 --> 3:16:10.760]  and of course that's been a point in my first paper on 911 and then again on this 14 point
[3:16:10.760 --> 3:16:16.520]  paper and so i raised that with bbc and we discussed it at some link but i even did an
[3:16:16.520 --> 3:16:22.040]  experiment right there with them shaping it with termite and sulfur out of June i've talked about
[3:16:22.040 --> 3:16:26.920]  this the number of i think alexa well hold on one moment i'm actually going to skip this break
[3:16:26.920 --> 3:16:31.880]  is this information it's too important right now with food prices now let's go ahead and skip that
[3:16:31.880 --> 3:16:36.440]  break uh with david ray griffin uh and steven jones because we have both of you i want to get
[3:16:36.440 --> 3:16:41.800]  make sure both of you have more time uh specifically yeah they're claiming that the that the metal
[3:16:41.800 --> 3:16:50.040]  was was was corroded uh in the heat and uh instead of being you know instantly melted uh and
[3:16:50.040 --> 3:16:59.000]  and so can you yeah so here's what we did so it's a female to their credit put this data in appendix
[3:16:59.000 --> 3:17:06.280]  c of their report that came out and then nift has totally ignored this uh data on the steel in fact
[3:17:06.280 --> 3:17:10.280]  nift admits they didn't look at any steel from world trade center seven in their report very
[3:17:11.480 --> 3:17:18.840]  blatant violation of normal scientific protocol they've been lied steven they they said there was
[3:17:18.840 --> 3:17:25.240]  no steel from a building sound very interesting point there's a lot of steel there i saw the photos
[3:17:25.240 --> 3:17:29.880]  of it but anyway okay and i know a lot of it was whisked away but we do know this sample but
[3:17:30.440 --> 3:17:34.280]  still exists uh because even in touch with the people at worcester polytechnic institute
[3:17:34.840 --> 3:17:39.480]  we have this deal from uh the rubble pile of building seven quite a distance because you know
[3:17:39.480 --> 3:17:45.400]  from from the other two towers so there's really very little question about it like marking and so on
[3:17:45.400 --> 3:17:51.480]  anyway so back to the story with bbc so i did this experiment with uh thermate which is what i call
[3:17:51.480 --> 3:17:59.160]  thermite post sulfur and i and i had a piece of steel from the south tower long story how i got
[3:17:59.160 --> 3:18:04.600]  this small sample of steel but it's actual steel from the world trade center put this slice of steel
[3:18:04.600 --> 3:18:12.360]  in the thermate touched it off bbc cameras rolling i don't see that they showed any of that but then
[3:18:12.360 --> 3:18:17.320]  we took that field down to be a scanning electron microscope and looked at it and sure enough there's
[3:18:17.320 --> 3:18:23.400]  sulfur in the steel which didn't surprisingly done this experiment before but you know i was trying
[3:18:23.400 --> 3:18:28.120]  to get the point across that we know how this sulfur and the this attack there's a hole in this
[3:18:28.120 --> 3:18:34.440]  deal when you do this with thermate and you showed all this to bbc and they really didn't show a lot
[3:18:34.440 --> 3:18:39.080]  of that and they didn't show it well let me tell you what's going to happen with this other guy from
[3:18:39.080 --> 3:18:45.080]  um i mean it's a production company uh yeah who just did a discovery channel piece on jfk now
[3:18:45.080 --> 3:18:50.600]  they're doing uh the sashes geographic what i mean i mean what he does is he hires a bunch of former
[3:18:50.600 --> 3:18:57.080]  cops and we know about these cop crime labs oh boy are they reliable give me a break uh you know
[3:18:57.080 --> 3:19:01.800]  blsbub's more accurate and then they have them and they're going to come out and show knowing
[3:19:01.800 --> 3:19:05.800]  that the general public's not going to go out and do your thermate test and it's going to be kind of
[3:19:05.800 --> 3:19:11.720]  like um you know piltdown man where they take a pig jaw and claim and they found a new human
[3:19:12.360 --> 3:19:19.080]  uh or the missing links so just get ready uh i mean unless i'm totally wrong about all this
[3:19:20.120 --> 3:19:25.160]  i still yeah i i know what you mean alex i'm just saying that i think it's worthwhile to take a
[3:19:25.160 --> 3:19:30.360]  shot trying to get some facts out there to the public even some of those slipped through in the
[3:19:30.360 --> 3:19:39.720]  bbc effort so i'm hopeful with this fellow robert and if i say his questions were were fair um
[3:19:39.720 --> 3:19:44.680]  and there's one question that he asked that i thought was a little off and so i didn't go there
[3:19:44.680 --> 3:19:53.080]  but i explained why his question was well um he's talking to professor thomas eager which is good
[3:19:53.080 --> 3:19:57.000]  in a sense i'd like to see i'd like to talk to professor eager i'd like to debate the issues
[3:19:57.000 --> 3:20:02.280]  publicly with professor eager particularly the 15 point but what are they asking on it yeah
[3:20:03.560 --> 3:20:07.960]  what did he specifically ask you about eager oh so what he was asking about was
[3:20:08.760 --> 3:20:15.880]  he said eager wants me to ask you how in the world can you get all these explosives into the towers
[3:20:16.600 --> 3:20:23.320]  uh and building seven to bring them down you know give me an exact scenario and my point was well
[3:20:23.320 --> 3:20:33.400]  look you have now found recipes in the dust and that show this uh explosive material is
[3:20:33.400 --> 3:20:36.280]  highly hold on hold on we're coming back to the full audience hold on here we go
[3:20:41.080 --> 3:20:44.120]  okay so professor jones is talking to the
[3:20:46.680 --> 3:20:50.280]  when we're going to go back to professor griffin here in just a moment he's talking to the
[3:20:50.280 --> 3:20:56.040]  the nash's geographic guy and then a guy saying this professor eager wants to know exactly how
[3:20:56.040 --> 3:21:00.920]  many bombs were in the building and exactly how they wired up seven and tower one and two
[3:21:00.920 --> 3:21:04.040]  well he asked me that same question over the phone and i said well building seven was a spook
[3:21:04.040 --> 3:21:09.800]  building cia fbi uh it was the emergency and he started laughing at me i mean that's an admitted
[3:21:09.800 --> 3:21:14.840]  fact but it's real funny uh and uh you know the same thing with the other buildings and professor
[3:21:14.840 --> 3:21:22.200]  jones was saying well hey uh we we found the explosives residue that's the issue here not
[3:21:22.200 --> 3:21:25.960]  how did they commit the whole crime we're saying there's evidence of a crime that's why we needed
[3:21:25.960 --> 3:21:32.200]  a real investigation not a cover-up uh professor jones and i that's that's right alex and that's
[3:21:32.200 --> 3:21:37.560]  what i explained to him and and uh on tape and you know so i didn't give him an exact scenario
[3:21:37.560 --> 3:21:42.200]  we what i said what there's there's a lot we can learn from the hard physical evidence
[3:21:42.200 --> 3:21:49.560]  from the 9-11 deaths and uh these residues that uh we're looking for that nfpa 9-21
[3:21:50.200 --> 3:21:57.480]  national fire uh code requires that the scene of a fire where there's a crime it certainly
[3:21:57.480 --> 3:22:03.960]  applies on 9-11 but then the next step just like in csi the scientists do their work but then you
[3:22:03.960 --> 3:22:10.520]  have other investigators with subpoena power for instance uh in a trial setting so that you can
[3:22:10.520 --> 3:22:16.200]  ask questions from a lot of people and get the answers of uh okay exactly how well you've now
[3:22:16.200 --> 3:22:19.800]  gotten peer-reviewed journals on this and i want to talk about that more of it but but going back
[3:22:19.800 --> 3:22:25.560]  to david uh ray griffin uh who by the way has written what now seven books uh on 9-11 is that
[3:22:25.560 --> 3:22:31.720]  correct professor uh yeah and and and we'll talk about the latest book before you leave us here
[3:22:31.720 --> 3:22:36.680]  but the time we've got you know you've studied more psychology you've studied more the human mind
[3:22:36.680 --> 3:22:42.200]  you know that's what your degree is more focused on uh studying this and being involved in the
[3:22:42.200 --> 3:22:49.160]  investigation uh you know we've got the solicitor general's uh you know wife now the fbi admits
[3:22:49.160 --> 3:22:55.720]  that he made up uh the phone calls she didn't call him i mean how are they getting so many
[3:22:55.720 --> 3:23:01.240]  people to lie who've been caught in lies and how do they get these tv presenters to knowingly go out
[3:23:01.240 --> 3:23:06.600]  and lie and and and say that barry jennings was in the building three hours when he was in their
[3:23:06.600 --> 3:23:14.040]  20 minutes i mean how do they find people to do this well they pay him big salaries um
[3:23:15.320 --> 3:23:22.360]  a lot of my work was in the problem of of evil and um and this is of course a very old story
[3:23:23.160 --> 3:23:29.720]  and it is that it still is shocking even though you know i've studied over the centuries uh the
[3:23:29.720 --> 3:23:37.560]  really uh just horrible things people can do and and other and at the same time be kind of ordinary
[3:23:37.560 --> 3:23:45.320]  good family men i mean this was notorious about the nazis that uh in fact uh you know the famous
[3:23:45.320 --> 3:23:53.320]  statement uh called the banality of evil a study of the nazis that these were just ordinary family
[3:23:53.320 --> 3:23:59.240]  men but get put in situations where they're you know their job depends on it their career
[3:23:59.240 --> 3:24:06.520]  it depends on it their salary depends on it and so on and uh it is uh astounding what people will
[3:24:06.520 --> 3:24:14.520]  do i was very disappointed on the bbc show they uh they at least dealt with this question of the
[3:24:15.560 --> 3:24:22.600]  the steel that had been turned into swiss cheese looking stuff that they at least mentioned this
[3:24:22.600 --> 3:24:29.480]  but they brought on one or two of those uh professors at warchester polytechnic institute
[3:24:29.480 --> 3:24:35.560]  who had done that study and you know at the time they said well they had no idea where the sulfur
[3:24:35.560 --> 3:24:44.280]  came from and uh on the bbc show one of them said oh well i don't find that surprising it could have
[3:24:44.280 --> 3:24:51.880]  just kind of mixed in uh you know heating up underground there and they claim steel now corroded
[3:24:51.880 --> 3:24:57.960]  in a few weeks in the heat when it's got the uh according to jones and others you know the classic
[3:24:57.960 --> 3:25:04.760]  burn holes you know that happen from something really fast well that's right and you'd you'd be
[3:25:04.760 --> 3:25:11.320]  talking about extremely high temperatures uh steven of what what temperatures would you need to
[3:25:11.320 --> 3:25:21.960]  to uh oxidize steel well uh you know of course steel can rest but the point here is that they're
[3:25:22.760 --> 3:25:29.080]  very high temperatures and evidence to reduce that steel beam to the thickness uh yeah very thin
[3:25:29.080 --> 3:25:34.520]  papers and the holes in it plus the sulfur in the steel i caught that too the fellow from
[3:25:34.520 --> 3:25:42.120]  wpi saying well it could be the cooperative term there is could have been something like uh
[3:25:42.120 --> 3:25:49.240]  wallboard that could introduce sulfur but you see wallboard has calcium and sulfur and they're
[3:25:49.240 --> 3:25:56.280]  very tightly bound with oxygen as well calcium sulfate so you know it's not an issue here just
[3:25:56.280 --> 3:26:01.240]  saying you could do it you you do experiments that's what we do in times that's why you do
[3:26:01.240 --> 3:26:07.320]  experiments for me we're gonna break and come back and talk about that experiment and then from
[3:26:07.320 --> 3:26:13.800]  both of you both professor jones and professor griffin find out where you think this should go
[3:26:13.800 --> 3:26:22.920]  from here stay with us we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on the run
[3:26:22.920 --> 3:26:33.640]  Alex jones and the gcn radio network more than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water
[3:26:33.640 --> 3:26:37.880]  and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than
[3:26:37.880 --> 3:26:42.280]  when drinking the water that's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and
[3:26:42.280 --> 3:26:47.720]  others are absorbed into the skin the kdf dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold
[3:26:47.720 --> 3:26:53.080]  water and it's designed to reduce chlorine lead mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of

[3:29:38.840 --> 3:29:44.680]  with both of you gentlemen today i'd like for you both just to have a discussion and cover
[3:29:44.680 --> 3:29:51.720]  the issues that you think are most important and we can go back over the science of building
[3:29:51.720 --> 3:29:56.920]  seven or tower one or two or that's only a small part of it you take all the evidence together
[3:29:56.920 --> 3:30:02.360]  that's what's really strong it's just seeing the other side how they always lie they always
[3:30:02.360 --> 3:30:08.280]  distort they always twist knowingly and i and i go back to what i was saying to david ray griffin
[3:30:09.080 --> 3:30:16.200]  who's top theologian amongst other things is yeah the nature of evil i mean do they
[3:30:16.200 --> 3:30:21.320]  rationalize to themselves i think some of them do that but others you know it's funny to them i
[3:30:21.320 --> 3:30:28.040]  mean i guess if they get a thrill by working with the evil by being padded on the head
[3:30:29.480 --> 3:30:38.920]  by the system david ray griffin well you know it's hard to know in all cases
[3:30:39.720 --> 3:30:48.440]  i think some of it is what sin claire lewis pointed out long ago that it's hard to get a man to
[3:30:48.440 --> 3:30:55.000]  understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it so i think in some cases
[3:30:55.000 --> 3:31:01.080]  the people in the news media uh you know they have blinders on and they just look selectively
[3:31:01.880 --> 3:31:09.160]  at the evidence that seems to support the official story and so they recognize well if they twist a
[3:31:09.160 --> 3:31:15.640]  little bit here and there they're they're doing it for a larger truth they can rationalize so i
[3:31:15.640 --> 3:31:20.360]  think there's some of it quite a bit of that going on rather than just uh well i know i'm
[3:31:20.360 --> 3:31:26.920]  doing something really horrible but i need i need the money um so i think there's a lot of
[3:31:26.920 --> 3:31:35.240]  self delusion that allows people to live with themselves absolutely uh steven johns i know
[3:31:35.240 --> 3:31:39.640]  you're a physicist so you stick mainly to the science but dealing with these people i mean
[3:31:39.640 --> 3:31:45.000]  your your evidence your research is conclusive it fits in with other research and eyewitness
[3:31:45.000 --> 3:31:52.280]  reports i mean it they're fitting square pegs and round holes we're fitting round you know pegs and
[3:31:52.280 --> 3:31:59.400]  round holes uh i mean what has this whole journey been like for you and where do you see 911 truth
[3:31:59.400 --> 3:32:04.360]  going now and then i'll ask that same question to griffin uh now that obama's coming in summer
[3:32:04.360 --> 3:32:09.320]  saying oh my gosh they think everything's fine okay now they're going to sleep not understanding the
[3:32:09.320 --> 3:32:16.920]  very same military industrial complex that clearly staged the attacks uh is still in control let me
[3:32:17.560 --> 3:32:23.240]  respond to that particular issue of where 911 truth movement is going alex i'm actually quite
[3:32:23.240 --> 3:32:30.440]  encouraged either the flip side to those basically official um people missed for example that
[3:32:31.000 --> 3:32:37.480]  keep uh evading many of our questions and then uh anyway we could discuss that further but i want
[3:32:37.480 --> 3:32:45.000]  to hit on and mention the people that are helping us and and these are there's really a very large
[3:32:45.000 --> 3:32:51.640]  as you know and you're a big part of it this large public movement to get out to 911 truth
[3:32:51.640 --> 3:32:57.880]  and in particular i want to thank those people uh in new york city who saved will treat center
[3:32:57.880 --> 3:33:05.880]  deaths the 911 deaths on that day or shortly thereafter we now have four samples that we're
[3:33:05.880 --> 3:33:14.760]  looking at in very actively and scrutinizing very carefully and uh this dust is just revealing
[3:33:14.760 --> 3:33:21.320]  so much to us about what really happened that day i have heard reports that the officials that
[3:33:21.320 --> 3:33:26.600]  gathered up the steel and shipped that over to asia for melting also tried to gather up
[3:33:26.600 --> 3:33:31.960]  all the dust but they did not succeed a lot of people saved dust because it came into their
[3:33:31.960 --> 3:33:38.520]  apartments it invaded their private space and and to their great credit these new yorkers
[3:33:38.520 --> 3:33:45.400]  saved some of that dust often just for souvenir and we've had a dust in from frank palacio
[3:33:45.400 --> 3:33:51.080]  who gathered a sample 10 minutes after the north tower collapsed that that dust is full of these
[3:33:51.080 --> 3:33:57.480]  red chips red on one side gray on the other that are very actively being studied now by
[3:33:57.480 --> 3:34:04.520]  uh three labs and their other labs anxious to study this material and the reason i mentioned this
[3:34:04.520 --> 3:34:12.200]  uh had an email from uh david here just before your program we would like to encourage others who
[3:34:12.200 --> 3:34:19.480]  have saved the samples to provide a portion of the sample retaining some for for a further study
[3:34:19.480 --> 3:34:24.840]  but this study is underway now we're not waiting for an official government sanction or group to
[3:34:24.840 --> 3:34:32.360]  study this we're studying it now and we want to turn this into an international effort the labs now
[3:34:32.360 --> 3:34:39.400]  are are here in indiana and new hampshire and we want to spread that to france and australia and
[3:34:39.400 --> 3:34:45.320]  so on there are people in france just very anxious to get their hands on a small 9-11
[3:34:45.320 --> 3:34:52.120]  dust sample sure we can look for the microspheres and the red-gray chips so steven would you want
[3:34:52.120 --> 3:34:58.280]  them to send it directly to you or how would they get it to you okay um i wouldn't want it to come
[3:34:58.280 --> 3:35:05.560]  directly to me then we have problems with uh chain of custody but if they want to write to me or um
[3:35:06.520 --> 3:35:11.720]  that you could give them the address or to send them the address right uh professor barbarian
[3:35:11.720 --> 3:35:19.000]  in france needs a sample desperately uh for example and we're trying to get that over to
[3:35:19.000 --> 3:35:24.120]  him it needs to be a sample needs to be about what would fit in your hand you know a cup shaped
[3:35:24.120 --> 3:35:28.520]  hand well how do folks get in contact with you through the journal yeah if they go to the
[3:35:28.520 --> 3:35:35.880]  journal of 911 studies dot com and then up the top click on contact us they can write to either
[3:35:35.880 --> 3:35:44.120]  kevin or either of the three editors kevin ryan frank levy a phd chemist in australia or myself
[3:35:44.120 --> 3:35:49.720]  and or if this is david griffin if anybody just wants to email me if you know my email
[3:35:50.280 --> 3:35:56.200]  i'm in contact with the same people in france so i can give you the address too right so we're
[3:35:56.200 --> 3:36:02.680]  very anxious to turn this into an international basically a public conducted investigation with
[3:36:02.680 --> 3:36:08.200]  the public being involved in providing well that is the good news we also have russian tv french
[3:36:08.200 --> 3:36:16.040]  spanish japanese i mean they're all doing doing real reports uh... that are showing
[3:36:16.040 --> 3:36:21.480]  wow there really is evidence of inside job uh... david rey griffin looking at this historically
[3:36:21.480 --> 3:36:26.680]  which you also look at how do you see it on unfolding now because at one level i do see
[3:36:26.680 --> 3:36:31.160]  it losing some wind in the sales with obama uh... but at another level it's already gone
[3:36:31.160 --> 3:36:37.240]  international and actually seems to be building uh... despite that uh... and you know false flag
[3:36:37.240 --> 3:36:43.000]  terrorism has now entered the nomenclature it's in movies it's in culture uh... people are now
[3:36:43.000 --> 3:36:48.280]  looking for it so it seems that the tool of government of false flag or or corporations
[3:36:48.280 --> 3:36:52.040]  has been damaged to a certain extent and some people say to me well why do you care that was
[3:36:52.040 --> 3:36:57.560]  seven years ago the whole point is the entire post nine eleven world this whole surveillance grid
[3:36:58.840 --> 3:37:06.040]  has been built on that lie so can you overall speak uh... to the nine eleven truth saga itself and
[3:37:06.040 --> 3:37:08.600]  where you see it you know what it's done and where you see it going
[3:37:09.720 --> 3:37:15.160]  yes uh... let me make three points one is uh... i think the uh... election of obama
[3:37:15.960 --> 3:37:23.800]  is uh... reason to uh... gear up not to have not to slow down because uh... you know although we
[3:37:23.800 --> 3:37:30.280]  all tried there was no realistic chance as long as bush was in power that anything was going to
[3:37:30.280 --> 3:37:35.880]  happen in term in the united states but with a new administration a new attorney general and so
[3:37:35.880 --> 3:37:42.440]  on uh... there is really a chance that we could have investigation now some people were motivated
[3:37:42.440 --> 3:37:47.720]  by revenge they wanted bush and cheney and the gang to be punished and that's understandable
[3:37:47.720 --> 3:37:52.680]  but that's not the main thing uh... the main thing is to get the policies changed as you've
[3:37:52.680 --> 3:37:59.720]  indicated uh... the so-called war on terror uh... it's set to continue obama thus far has talked
[3:37:59.720 --> 3:38:07.160]  about uh... increasing our activities in afghanistan yes and uh... they're still talking as if they
[3:38:07.160 --> 3:38:12.840]  believe that obama ben laden is still alive you know there's no evidence that he's been alive
[3:38:12.840 --> 3:38:19.560]  in fact it appears they're reviving him they're there yeah he's uh... he's uh... i'm just writing
[3:38:19.560 --> 3:38:25.560]  a paper on that and it's the you know the evidence is very strong and the evidence that he's been
[3:38:25.560 --> 3:38:32.760]  alive since 2001 is really uh... extremely weak to non-existent yeah so that's one point that we
[3:38:32.760 --> 3:38:39.320]  should be increasing our activity not decreasing it secondly on this internationalization
[3:38:39.880 --> 3:38:47.000]  i just returned from a tour in japan and there is uh... increasing interest there we had almost
[3:38:47.000 --> 3:38:56.200]  500 people turn out in tokyo for an all-day conference and uh... and then we have uh...
[3:38:56.200 --> 3:39:02.600]  we have political leaders in tokyo who have taken a public stand and of course that adds
[3:39:02.600 --> 3:39:10.600]  credibility and i've been working with uh... fujita and uh... and another person to bring
[3:39:10.600 --> 3:39:16.680]  about a group called political leaders for nine eleven truth which will be an international movement
[3:39:16.680 --> 3:39:21.240]  we already in fact have a website although if you go there there's nothing on it there
[3:39:21.240 --> 3:39:27.560]  but we're all ready to fill in the the data so that'll be a significant event and thirdly
[3:39:28.680 --> 3:39:36.360]  uh... hello you still there yes we're here okay i just thirdly a new group has just formed called
[3:39:36.360 --> 3:39:42.680]  lawyers for nine eleven truth uh... which is an international group and uh... william pepper
[3:39:42.680 --> 3:39:47.800]  and many other leading lawyers have already signed up and uh... it's moving along rather
[3:39:48.440 --> 3:39:56.200]  quickly so uh... the the point is that whereas steven and kevin and others have led the way to
[3:39:56.200 --> 3:40:02.680]  get us to this point where the science is so strong uh... that is now time to turn it over
[3:40:03.400 --> 3:40:09.800]  uh... to the the political and uh... legal realm and uh... that is now starting to happen
[3:40:09.800 --> 3:40:13.320]  all right well let's look forward uh... first you uh... professor river than
[3:40:13.320 --> 3:40:20.920]  uh... quickly than uh... get a uh... response from professor jones how do you see an unfolding
[3:40:20.920 --> 3:40:25.640]  in the future because it is continuing to grow people understand how core and issue it is of
[3:40:25.640 --> 3:40:31.160]  government sponsored terror of provocative uh... actions how do you see an unfolding do you see
[3:40:31.160 --> 3:40:37.880]  any justice to the perpetrators or or or do you just see it becoming a public secret uh... that
[3:40:37.880 --> 3:40:44.200]  this has been done thus deterring the some of the same institutions from pulling off uh...
[3:40:44.200 --> 3:40:49.800]  similar events in the future well i would prefer a third alternative uh...
[3:40:49.800 --> 3:40:56.840]  as i say i'm not interested in and resend and i'm rather i'm i'm rather encouraged by uh...
[3:40:56.840 --> 3:41:03.400]  obama i know some people aren't but i am first of all he is very bright and secondly i believe he
[3:41:03.400 --> 3:41:10.520]  has also got a strong moral compass and uh... he also appreciates constitutional law and he knows
[3:41:10.520 --> 3:41:18.280]  what has been done uh... here and uh... so i think uh... that he will be open to uh... he and his
[3:41:18.280 --> 3:41:24.680]  people will be open to evidence so i i that's why i say i think we need to uh... ramp things up
[3:41:25.320 --> 3:41:29.800]  uh... and present the strongest evidence and and take every route we can to get it
[3:41:29.800 --> 3:41:33.880]  uh... bring it to the attention of the obama uh... people
[3:41:34.440 --> 3:41:41.080]  because uh... i think there is the chance for real investigation and but i that but also he
[3:41:41.080 --> 3:41:47.320]  has shown that he has this uh... virtue called forgiveness uh... that you know at least in our
[3:41:47.320 --> 3:41:54.200]  christian tradition uh... it's been called a virtue and uh... he's he's willing to let bygones be
[3:41:54.200 --> 3:42:01.240]  got bygones and so i think if the most hopeful route would be a truth and reconciliation commission
[3:42:01.960 --> 3:42:08.680]  where the main thing would be to get the truth out and therefore get the policies changed and if
[3:42:08.680 --> 3:42:15.400]  these people uh... you know they'll have their own punishment uh... you know just knowing what they
[3:42:15.400 --> 3:42:20.840]  did and have other people know what they did uh... that's a very secondary or tertiary matter from
[3:42:20.840 --> 3:42:25.400]  my point of view professor jones
[3:42:25.400 --> 3:42:31.640]  um i guess mine would be uh... almost a fourth alternative for maybe maybe a modification of
[3:42:31.640 --> 3:42:36.360]  a couple others and that is i think from the people ourselves internationally now
[3:42:37.160 --> 3:42:43.800]  as uh it's clear that there is an awakening going on i think that there can be this grassroots
[3:42:43.800 --> 3:42:51.080]  movement coupled frankly with uh... economic difficulties that are making people say well
[3:42:51.080 --> 3:42:58.680]  wait a minute maybe uh i shouldn't trust the government and everything i mean the depression
[3:42:58.680 --> 3:43:03.000]  or recession whatever you want to call it this seems to be spreading internationally is uh
[3:43:03.000 --> 3:43:09.480]  inducing people to take a hard look at what what has brought us to this state and as that happened
[3:43:09.480 --> 3:43:15.640]  and through the internet and programs like yours alex the truth about 9-11 i believe will
[3:43:15.640 --> 3:43:23.240]  resonate with more people who have this grassroots movement demanding answers and i think that
[3:43:23.240 --> 3:43:30.200]  coupled with uh the science will will force politicians even in our own congress to say
[3:43:30.200 --> 3:43:36.600]  look we need to take a look at this i might say that our congressman my congressman here in
[3:43:36.600 --> 3:43:43.080]  utah uh came over to my little apartment and spent an hour with me one-on-one discussing
[3:43:43.080 --> 3:43:49.400]  9-11 issues and the research that i've done and he is very supportive of a 9-11 investigation
[3:43:50.040 --> 3:43:57.400]  jason schepitz just newly elected replaced chris cammin well jason jason schepish so
[3:43:58.360 --> 3:44:03.320]  schepitz right so you know i'm very encouraged that and i know there are a lot of people
[3:44:03.320 --> 3:44:10.520]  uh locally and internationally that are it is is that a federal congressman
[3:44:11.320 --> 3:44:19.320]  yes how do you spell his name jason schepis schepitz c h a f f e t z
[3:44:20.120 --> 3:44:26.360]  all right i want to get him on now you should well okay yes that he's he's just new into the
[3:44:26.360 --> 3:44:31.480]  congress his first uh first round you know in congress so he is a 9-11 truther or he's
[3:44:31.480 --> 3:44:37.400]  investigating i would he supports an investigation and he wanted to talk to me and so we did for
[3:44:37.400 --> 3:44:44.840]  an hour in my apartment well that's fabulous that is fabulous news um okay in the people
[3:44:46.120 --> 3:44:51.000]  in the 10 minutes or go ahead no no no i mean you were saying that the people are
[3:44:52.520 --> 3:44:59.240]  people are uh leaning on their congressman to to do an investigation i'm hoping that is
[3:44:59.240 --> 3:45:05.800]  uh you know various conditions cause people to wake up that they will continue to speak out to
[3:45:05.800 --> 3:45:11.080]  their congressman not let that down but now you know keep the pressure up on the congressman
[3:45:11.080 --> 3:45:17.000]  and internationally too so that as david said we can get the political and the legal
[3:45:17.000 --> 3:45:23.400]  on active in pursuing uh justice and truth david rey griffin isn't there also a facet to this
[3:45:23.400 --> 3:45:32.520]  that the people have learned that when the mainstream media uh is is attacking a 9-11
[3:45:32.520 --> 3:45:39.960]  truth movement or a jfk investigation movement or any other movement that generally the the
[3:45:39.960 --> 3:45:46.360]  mainstream media is so discredited now uh that it almost makes people then go investigate what
[3:45:46.360 --> 3:45:52.840]  we're saying i mean i found as bad as the history channel piece was that it seemed to backfire on
[3:45:52.840 --> 3:45:59.640]  them and got more people to actually look at the evidence well yeah the and the yeah the the bbc
[3:45:59.640 --> 3:46:08.040]  show did that had the same effect um yeah and just uh building on what steven was saying there i
[3:46:08.040 --> 3:46:14.360]  think uh that it will take an international movement and that's why i'm encouraged that
[3:46:14.360 --> 3:46:22.680]  japan it looks like now will be putting pressure on uh washington and saying look we lost some people
[3:46:22.680 --> 3:46:32.120]  um in the towers and uh we uh we've only had uh the assurance of president bush that uh these
[3:46:32.120 --> 3:46:38.680]  were muslims who did this give us the proof um i understand from annie mcconnell she was here
[3:46:38.680 --> 3:46:46.680]  recently from the uk uh the leader of the london movement and she says that uh whereas some people
[3:46:46.680 --> 3:46:52.840]  in united states had said things were dying down a little bit here because the bush cheney people
[3:46:52.840 --> 3:46:59.960]  would be leaving office that in europe it's actually getting much more uh interest well let me say it's
[3:46:59.960 --> 3:47:05.400]  only getting bigger from what i see in new york this last year in other places i'm just saying some
[3:47:05.400 --> 3:47:11.560]  fear that you know it's a bush centric all about bush whereas the very same military
[3:47:11.560 --> 3:47:16.600]  industrial complex that did this uh is still there and i think that's the point that has to
[3:47:16.600 --> 3:47:21.080]  be made but but we'll see uh what barack obama does i mean i have to tell you i'm pointing
[3:47:21.080 --> 3:47:25.640]  hillary clinton or moving to put her in secretary of state and a bunch of other stuff i i think
[3:47:25.640 --> 3:47:29.240]  we're going to see betrayal from him but we can hope for the best final segment whatever we're

[3:51:41.800 --> 3:51:53.400]  you uh... also uh... going to david rey griffin tell us about your latest book your your seventh book uh... on 9 11 well that's
[3:51:53.400 --> 3:52:00.200]  the new pearl harbor uh... resisted and uh... it's uh... some people have thought it's an update or a
[3:52:00.200 --> 3:52:06.120]  revision of the new pearl harbor but not at all it's a totally new book the idea is that uh...
[3:52:06.120 --> 3:52:11.720]  it's a journalist or a politician we're going to try to dig into this uh... who knew nothing about it before
[3:52:12.440 --> 3:52:18.440]  uh... it's kind of overwhelming uh... to think you know they might have to read 20 journal articles and
[3:52:18.440 --> 3:52:24.840]  uh... three or seven books or so so the idea was to try to get all the most essential information in
[3:52:24.840 --> 3:52:30.680]  two books though that it's now a two-volume set the new pearl harbor and the new pearl harbor uh...
[3:52:30.680 --> 3:52:38.040]  resisted and by the way when you read these books or or or you go over the 500 smoking guns of 9 11 online
[3:52:38.440 --> 3:52:45.240]  it is mind-blowing i mean just how obvious it is david well that's right and i've always argued the main
[3:52:45.240 --> 3:52:52.360]  thing is a cumulative case that uh... no matter which part of the story you look at you find uh...
[3:52:52.360 --> 3:53:00.600]  uh... can believe you know outright contradictions and lies and just uh... assertions that from a scientific
[3:53:00.600 --> 3:53:06.200]  point of view well that's it i'd not be true when that's it it is that it's the covering up mean the
[3:53:06.200 --> 3:53:12.120]  the other evidence is strong too but the covering up the sneakiness the lying uh... the acting so
[3:53:12.120 --> 3:53:18.280]  suspicious i mean that is really powerful and in closing uh... steven jones your take on that i mean
[3:53:18.280 --> 3:53:22.920]  uh... even is that strong evidence where they lie and cover up
[3:53:22.920 --> 3:53:28.600]  well sure and of course uh... the field was cut up and shipped out of this country over the protests
[3:53:28.600 --> 3:53:35.960]  uh... many scientists and engineers who felt that this data was evident especially involving
[3:53:36.760 --> 3:53:40.760]  uh... an understanding what happened on 9 11
[3:53:40.760 --> 3:53:43.880]  so and again now the best we have is still
[3:53:43.880 --> 3:53:51.160]  no expand and uh... i just wanted to re-emphasize that i'm working with david and others
[3:53:51.160 --> 3:53:58.680]  kevin ryan and others trying to understand and get samples of this 9 11 dust out to scientists
[3:53:58.680 --> 3:54:05.400]  worldwide so that we can really uh... corroborate confirm the the results that we're getting the
[3:54:05.400 --> 3:54:11.720]  findings of the yeah the residues of explosives so that people can uh... you know hear about it
[3:54:11.720 --> 3:54:15.720]  from scientists i believe that there's a lot of trust
[3:54:15.720 --> 3:54:21.320]  still in science as opposed to politicians i guess i could say it that way and i believe
[3:54:21.320 --> 3:54:27.000]  if we can get this out to the public and keep that public discussion going based on hard evidence
[3:54:27.000 --> 3:54:32.440]  that will make tremendous strides in the next year absolutely and folks can get in contact
[3:54:32.440 --> 3:54:38.600]  and read your papers i tell them the best place for that uh... just go to journal of 9 11 studies
