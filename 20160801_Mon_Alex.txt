[00:00.000 --> 00:17.480]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you all from the front lines of the Info
[00:17.480 --> 00:32.000]  War. We're live, it's August 1st, 2016. We are three months and a week out from the general election, 100
[00:32.000 --> 00:40.240]  days. I'm talking to Paul Joseph Watson this morning and I said what's your assessment of the
[00:40.240 --> 00:48.600]  world right now and he said we're going into a cycle of serious corruption, a cycle of collapse,
[00:48.600 --> 00:57.120]  a cycle of general insanity because the world has become so unnatural and humanity is basically
[00:57.120 --> 01:07.840]  trying to get its balance and the social engineers are using that imbalance to gain greater control.
[01:07.840 --> 01:15.160]  And I said that's exactly what's going on and I said you understand Paul that we're not on a
[01:15.160 --> 01:20.880]  power trip at Info Wars. We have an incredible responsibility and I told him a lot of things
[01:20.880 --> 01:27.800]  that no one else really knows in the crew of some of the really dangerous behind-the-scenes
[01:27.800 --> 01:40.040]  things going on. But I tell you being involved in the highest levels of change globally is a
[01:40.040 --> 01:51.320]  incredible responsibility and it's like jumping 500 feet into freezing water. And you look around
[01:51.320 --> 01:56.400]  at the rest of the public who are basically in a rest of development living in a fantasy world
[01:56.400 --> 02:03.360]  and it's scary. Even the supposedly focused individuals that are politically involved
[02:03.360 --> 02:12.240]  still aren't one-tenth as serious as they should be. And I understand we've been inducted into
[02:12.240 --> 02:18.560]  this matrix-like system from birth. It's getting more intense as we go but man the level of outright
[02:18.560 --> 02:28.000]  corruption and evil and the directed persecution of not just humanity and the genetic code of
[02:28.000 --> 02:43.160]  the different species but the entire planet itself it is beyond devilish. We're going to
[02:43.160 --> 02:47.360]  cover all this news today and Joel Scouse is going to join us later in the middle of the broadcast
[02:47.360 --> 02:54.360]  World Fair's Brief. Probably the different things that are happening geopolitically. But the New
[02:54.360 --> 02:59.000]  World Order are masters at controlling narratives and they put out a fake right-wing narrative,
[02:59.000 --> 03:06.720]  a fake left-wing narrative. That's what's done on a planetary scale. When I say transcend the
[03:06.720 --> 03:15.120]  left-right paradigm, I turn my coin more than 20 years ago, I wasn't saying there isn't a left
[03:15.120 --> 03:21.080]  or a right. I'm saying normally the left and right are controlled and that's what Carol Quigley
[03:21.080 --> 03:25.760]  wrote about at Georgetown. He said it'll look like there's a difference on the surface but
[03:25.760 --> 03:30.120]  beneath that there's really no difference and the same elites will control it so that people will
[03:30.120 --> 03:33.800]  revolt through the political system believing they're going to have change but the change never
[03:33.800 --> 03:39.480]  really comes. But you see once you're aware of that paradigm then it's the beginning of the end
[03:39.480 --> 03:44.040]  and the globalists know that. And Brzezinski now says they've lost control to the council on
[03:44.040 --> 03:49.040]  foreign relations in three different speeches and says it's just easier to start killing everybody
[03:49.040 --> 03:57.880]  than controlling them. He admits they're losing. So the establishment's really discussing some
[03:57.880 --> 04:05.520]  hardcore stuff like World War III just to control populations and World War III will be as much
[04:05.520 --> 04:12.840]  against the United States as it is against Russia and folks have to transcend to the globalist
[04:12.840 --> 04:19.160]  mindset or descend depending on how you look at it to see that they're attacking the nation state.
[04:19.160 --> 04:24.120]  Now I'm not saying we become globalist but we have to think like a globalist to understand
[04:24.120 --> 04:32.440]  from a globalist perspective. Where are the serious men? Where are the serious women? Well
[04:32.440 --> 04:39.080]  there aren't a lot of them and so that's why Info Wars has become the counter narrative to a great
[04:39.080 --> 04:44.720]  extent to the entire world government system and I think you need to know that as listeners not at
[04:44.720 --> 04:53.040]  some braggadocia point for the broadcast but to actually examine the true danger. We are all
[04:53.040 --> 04:58.680]  in because of the nature of this fight. Stay with us. We've got to replicate this data analysis
[04:58.680 --> 05:04.080]  quickly. Hillary Clinton suggested the grieving families of victims of the Benghazi attack
[05:04.080 --> 05:08.240]  are liars and an appearance on Fox News Sunday. While the corporate media obsessed over Donald
[05:08.240 --> 05:12.480]  Trump's response to a fallen soldier from a Muslim immigrant family, Clinton's response to Pat
[05:12.480 --> 05:17.200]  Smith over the death of her son in Libya was glossed over as reported by Steve Watson. Clinton
[05:17.200 --> 05:21.440]  said quote, I don't hold any ill feeling for someone who in that moment may not fully recall
[05:21.440 --> 05:26.200]  everything that was or wasn't said. Now that's a bold statement coming from Hillary's mouth considering
[05:26.200 --> 05:31.120]  the FBI revealed she lied numerous times about sending classified information over her unsecured
[05:31.120 --> 05:36.120]  private email server. Hillary's suggesting once again that families of the Benghazi victims didn't
[05:36.120 --> 05:40.920]  hear her properly when she told them the cause of the attack was an anti-Muslim YouTube video that
[05:40.920 --> 05:45.080]  it was not a coordinated pre-planned terror attack. But private emails revealed Hillary knows the
[05:45.080 --> 05:49.200]  terrorist attack. And additionally, the whole story about the YouTube video was a state department
[05:49.200 --> 05:54.280]  fabrication to cover up the department's role in shipping living weapons to jihadists in Syria via
[05:54.280 --> 06:09.000]  Benghazi. For more reports, visit infowars.com. This is Kit Daniels reporting. A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health. Deep Cleanse by infowarslife.com. A scientifically formulated blend of nanocoloidal zeolites and organic

[07:03.800 --> 07:08.760]  for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message. Here's why.
[07:08.760 --> 07:13.880]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse, so please listen.
[07:13.880 --> 07:19.000]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power. And unlike gas generators,
[07:19.000 --> 07:23.880]  solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[07:23.880 --> 07:29.080]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to
[07:29.080 --> 07:32.600]  have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep. And here's the best news if you want to
[07:32.600 --> 07:38.360]  get one this week. Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators,
[07:38.360 --> 07:43.320]  and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low
[07:43.320 --> 07:48.840]  price for infowars listeners. So it's a good time to check it out. Go to gridwars.com. That's
[07:48.840 --> 07:54.600]  gridwars.com. It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money. Go to
[07:54.600 --> 08:19.640]  gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com. I want to be deadly clear right here at the beginning of this
[08:19.640 --> 08:27.960]  broadcast. Planetary world government is being established. The controlling central banks
[08:27.960 --> 08:42.760]  plan on an extended worldwide depression, conflict, wars, and other crises to bring in the next phase
[08:42.760 --> 08:51.320]  after the organized collapse. Even the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times are admitting that
[08:51.320 --> 08:59.640]  we've had a recovery that was not a recovery. Even with cooked numbers, this nation is seeing
[09:00.840 --> 09:10.040]  0.8 or 0.8 growth rates. That is certainly a multi-number negative when you understand they
[09:10.040 --> 09:19.720]  cook unemployment in other systems. This is organized. This is planned.
[09:26.040 --> 09:36.600]  We have to come to grips with the fact that only Donald Trump is even remotely
[09:36.600 --> 09:44.520]  talking about the reasons that this is happening and that's why the entire power structure is
[09:44.520 --> 09:57.880]  against him. The social engineers, the culture controllers are probing and are testing right
[09:57.880 --> 10:09.320]  now to see exactly how far they can push us. Much of the evidence shows they are trying to push us
[10:12.840 --> 10:22.120]  in a direction that will cause civil unrest. I know I'm stating a lot of obvious things here,
[10:22.120 --> 10:29.640]  but undoubtedly, we are entering a time of intensified crisis. If you think all of the
[10:29.640 --> 10:37.880]  escalation you've seen the last few years is serious, just get ready. The globalists are
[10:37.880 --> 10:42.920]  gambling to bring the world into this level of crisis because during this crisis, there's going
[10:42.920 --> 10:47.960]  to be a lot of people that are exposing, like UKIP and Info Wars and Drudge and others,
[10:47.960 --> 10:55.320]  exactly who the authors of this are. The globalists are the authors of it. You're going to see
[10:55.320 --> 11:01.400]  massive political upheaval and populist movements that are bringing global government and the entire
[11:01.400 --> 11:12.840]  project of the New World Order to its knees. What I'm trying to get across to you is things are bad.
[11:12.840 --> 11:20.040]  They're worse than bad. We're facing a scientific evil. But also, things are really good because
[11:20.040 --> 11:27.320]  there is a serious awakening. It's moving faster and growing faster and we're having big success
[11:27.320 --> 11:34.360]  against the technocrats across the board when we stand up, when we get involved.
[11:37.160 --> 11:41.880]  Now, let me just do this. Let me just, again, try to just read you some of the top headlines
[11:41.880 --> 11:45.160]  that I'm going to be burrowing through in this hour, then taking your phone calls, then Joel
[11:45.160 --> 11:51.160]  Scousen joins us, editor of World Affairs Brief. Exclusive. This is from Breitbart,
[11:51.160 --> 11:55.800]  but it's Aaron Klein with WorldNet Daily, who I saw at the DNC. I wish I would have asked William
[11:55.800 --> 11:59.400]  Benning this question because when he was on a year ago, he talked about, we've got Hillary
[11:59.400 --> 12:03.240]  Clinton's emails. But he said it again, this time it's become an actual news story. I want
[12:03.240 --> 12:06.600]  to get him back on this week to talk about it. Former technical director of the NSA.
[12:06.600 --> 12:14.200]  NSA architect agency has all of Clinton's deleted emails. Well, of course they do.
[12:14.200 --> 12:20.760]  And then he goes over the fact that he set up the program. Well, don't you know the Democrats
[12:20.760 --> 12:27.720]  have copies as well. Julian Assange hacked emails include info on Hillary's arming of
[12:27.720 --> 12:37.320]  jihadists, including ISIS in Syria, and the Russians are getting ready to release them.
[12:37.880 --> 12:42.040]  The Clinton Foundation state and Kremlin connections, even the Wall Street Journal,
[12:42.040 --> 12:47.960]  is saying, how dare Hillary come out with no evidence and say that Trump has some connection
[12:47.960 --> 12:54.520]  to the Russians when Hillary's been involved, transferring uranium and high tech chips. See,
[12:54.520 --> 12:59.640]  that's because they want war in the future. Hillary is in there with all the different parties
[12:59.640 --> 13:04.280]  engaged in every form of treason you can imagine at her foundation, getting hundreds of millions
[13:04.280 --> 13:12.200]  of dollars, 30 plus million dollars in one payment directly with Vladimir Putin getting
[13:12.200 --> 13:19.320]  technology. It was Hillary and it was Bill that helped transfer the nuclear reactors to
[13:19.320 --> 13:24.600]  North Korea, which were the type to make a bombs and don't even work as well.
[13:25.960 --> 13:30.040]  She's stabilizing the world again. I mean, you talk about evil and then she gets up there and
[13:30.040 --> 13:34.520]  goes, oh, I'm going to stabilize the world. And Bill Clinton says, you send her into an area,
[13:34.520 --> 13:39.320]  a country, a place in crisis, everything just gets better. This woman fixes things better than
[13:39.320 --> 13:46.280]  anybody I've ever seen. The crowd. I mean, she shows up and everything basically blows up and
[13:46.280 --> 13:53.240]  burns down on purpose. She said, oh, I guess we did make Libya failed state. That was the plan
[13:53.240 --> 13:59.560]  to begin with because it was stabilizing all of Africa. Muammar Gaddafi was actually investing
[13:59.560 --> 14:07.240]  all over Africa, tapping aquifers, putting in plants, building factories. He lived in a tent
[14:07.240 --> 14:10.280]  behind a 10 foot wall. I mean, I'm not saying he's perfect, but if you're going to have a
[14:10.280 --> 14:14.840]  philosopher king, the guy gave like 99% of the money from the oil directly to the people.
[14:14.840 --> 14:19.480]  They went and blew that up and put al-Qaeda in charge, also known as ISIS. Oh, I said,
[14:19.480 --> 14:23.480]  I just read the headlines. See, I can't. Oh, so the Clinton Foundation state and Kremlin connections
[14:24.840 --> 14:30.920]  report Hillary Clinton campaign manager John Podesta sat on board of company that bagged 35
[14:30.920 --> 14:36.840]  million from Putin connected Russian fund. That doesn't matter. New York Post runs more
[14:36.840 --> 14:42.520]  naked photos of Trump's supermodel life. That's what supermodels do is pose with their tops off.
[14:42.520 --> 14:47.240]  You know, you've got all over the world paintings of women with their tops off.
[14:47.240 --> 14:53.000]  You've got sculptures of it. It's called appreciating the finer things that God has given us.
[14:54.360 --> 15:00.440]  I just want to have first lady. I mean, that is awesome. Not some stuck up weird communist or some
[15:00.440 --> 15:07.880]  other freakazoid. I'm not even going into this is whatever the top story is. I'm just giving you
[15:07.880 --> 15:13.960]  what I sit here and look at the top one in fours.com and prisonplanet.com. Here's the economy stack.
[15:13.960 --> 15:20.120]  Seven years later, recovery remains the weakest of the post world war two era because it's fake.
[15:20.120 --> 15:25.080]  And that's with fake numbers. As I said earlier, I mean, we're talking two, three point negative.
[15:25.080 --> 15:32.840]  That is a roaring depression. But see, they selectively pick the winners now in the economy.
[15:32.840 --> 15:37.240]  If you're the right family, the right group, the right globalist organization, the right political
[15:37.240 --> 15:44.760]  vent, fragile US economy. This is Bloomberg now facing a slowdown in building boom.
[15:47.400 --> 15:51.720]  And that was only a fake building boom because they gave the elite banks free money by the
[15:51.720 --> 15:55.640]  trillions that nobody else. That's why you saw buildings being built everywhere through you,
[15:55.640 --> 16:00.520]  the new renter class that it's never going to own. And you're going to pay
[16:00.520 --> 16:06.440]  on average in Austin $3,000 a month for a 250 square foot apartment.
[16:06.440 --> 16:10.920]  Just a few years ago, you'd pay that for in a nice area town for a 2,000 square foot,
[16:10.920 --> 16:18.760]  not anymore. It's trendy where you pay more for less to the guys that fly jumbo jets and have
[16:18.760 --> 16:26.200]  jet copters and 50 mattresses. But they told you it was cute to be poor.
[16:26.200 --> 16:34.120]  Oil giant Exxon profits crash 59% 17 year low. Texas shale oil has fought Saudi Arabia to a
[16:34.120 --> 16:39.240]  standstill on a telegraph. Italy's oldest bank, it's 5 billion euro rescue.
[16:42.680 --> 16:51.800]  But boy, it's a great economy. Look at this little juicy up on info wars.com. We saw this a couple
[16:51.800 --> 16:58.280]  times in Germany lately, but now it's in London. Authorities cover up London car bomb attack
[16:58.280 --> 17:01.160]  that the police admitted. Now it's a real bomb. They're able to diffuse it. But
[17:01.880 --> 17:07.240]  oh, I love this new thing from the left, the controlled left. They're running around now
[17:07.240 --> 17:11.400]  calling themselves conspiracy theorists writing articles that Jones is sold out.
[17:11.400 --> 17:18.440]  Jones always said Muslim attacks were false flags and fake. And now he says they're all real. Jones,
[17:18.440 --> 17:22.440]  Jones is a right winger. Jones is blah, blah, blah. No, what I am is a patron. I told the truth.
[17:22.440 --> 17:26.440]  When the FBI gets caught getting a mentally ill person and trying to get him to blow up a Christmas
[17:26.440 --> 17:30.520]  tree in Portland, Oregon, the Christmas tree lining. And it turns out that he had no jihadi
[17:30.520 --> 17:34.280]  connections and they went and found a mentally ill person and got him to try to go do it.
[17:34.280 --> 17:38.760]  That is an attempt to get funding. And that's a false flag. And we talk about it at nauseam.
[17:38.760 --> 17:43.720]  And there's a bunch of those a new phase has begun where the false flag is the globalist
[17:43.720 --> 17:51.000]  are letting in 5 million in Europe. And who knows how many here real jihadis 80% military age men
[17:51.000 --> 17:55.560]  and they're attacking and they're killing. And then they take our rights and start Islamic training
[17:55.560 --> 18:01.000]  in schools to make us conform with them to go along with it. That's the next phase.
[18:01.880 --> 18:07.080]  That's what's going on. So see the strategies change, the globalist operations change. And I
[18:07.080 --> 18:12.920]  get up here and I explain what's going on. And world leaders listen and all the major
[18:12.920 --> 18:17.000]  intelligence agencies listen and the Pentagon listens and everybody else listens. I'm not
[18:17.000 --> 18:21.960]  bragging. It's a fact because I know what I'm talking about because I come from a smart family
[18:21.960 --> 18:26.520]  with good genetics that are smart and have always been involved in stuff like this. Now you go suck
[18:26.520 --> 18:34.920]  your thumbs and talk to mommy. Now continuing. There's a real program to flood the West with
[18:34.920 --> 18:43.240]  jihadist. They're flooding Russia with them. They're attacking. It's real. It's real when 200 plus
[18:43.240 --> 18:48.440]  thousand Christians get killed by jihadist forces brought in to Syria by Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[18:48.440 --> 18:54.600]  It's in the stinking emails. We told you it was coming beforehand. We were against killing the
[18:54.600 --> 19:00.680]  100 plus thousand moderate Muslims. And that's what they were in Libya. We were against the Iraq
[19:00.680 --> 19:05.480]  war because those were moderate Muslims being taken down by Saudi Arabia and the globalist.
[19:05.480 --> 19:11.880]  The globalist are running the Wahhabist jihad death cult and it's taking over all of Islam
[19:11.880 --> 19:16.600]  and they're murdering 10 to one Muslims that they kill Westerners or Christians. And I'm against that.
[19:19.480 --> 19:24.360]  There are a lot of Muslims that don't want to be in the most radical extreme version of it. But I

[23:29.320 --> 23:33.880]  We've all been taught that when you die and if you're good, you go to heaven. What have you
[23:33.880 --> 23:37.960]  found out that when you die, you don't go to heaven, but you sleep in the grave and await a
[23:37.960 --> 23:44.520]  resurrection? We built a website for the curious. It's called TheBibleSaysThat.org. What you've been
[23:44.520 --> 23:49.880]  taught might not actually be in the Bible. TheBibleSaysThat.org dismantles misguided religious
[23:49.880 --> 23:54.440]  doctrines and helps you find your own way, your own answers straight from the Bible.
[23:54.440 --> 24:08.920]  Find out who's really in heaven at TheBibleSaysThat.org.
[24:08.920 --> 24:26.040]  All right. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to tell you some of the other news that's coming
[24:26.040 --> 24:32.440]  up in the next segment. And then I'm also going to tell you about a project we're launching here
[24:34.120 --> 24:36.760]  that is just a shed light on the fact that Hillary stole the nomination
[24:36.760 --> 24:42.760]  and that our electoral process is in serious trouble. And for the first time in history,
[24:46.040 --> 24:53.240]  we have a nominee who lost in the primary, but was installed by superdelegates. They created
[24:53.240 --> 24:59.080]  in 1972, but never implemented. And so if this president gets set, we're going to see a new
[24:59.080 --> 25:04.760]  imperium set up, just like in this old Soviet Union or in communist China today, where we have
[25:04.760 --> 25:11.960]  a central committee and then a Politburo that elects the presidents. I mean, that's what this is.
[25:12.840 --> 25:16.840]  And so I shot a video Saturday. It's called an emergency message to Donald Trump.
[25:18.520 --> 25:22.360]  I'm going to repost at the front page of info wars.com. In the next hour, Paul Watson is doing
[25:22.360 --> 25:27.240]  an article about it. And then we're going to do big detailed investigative reports documenting
[25:27.240 --> 25:30.760]  all the different ways they're cheating, the way they're stealing, the way they're manipulating.
[25:30.760 --> 25:36.840]  How Google's not listing Trump as a presidential candidate, how Twitter's blocking it,
[25:36.840 --> 25:40.280]  how they're rigging the debates, how they're rigging polls. So people could just say, hey,
[25:40.280 --> 25:43.880]  do you really want to be part of a rigged election and make yourself feel like you're with a winner,
[25:43.880 --> 25:49.400]  Hillary Clinton? Because I'm reading about record numbers now saying they're going to
[25:49.400 --> 25:54.280]  vote for Green Party or Libertarian because they don't want Trump or Hillary. You have to go for
[25:54.280 --> 25:59.480]  Trump. He bucked the whole system. They tried to steal the nomination. He fought for it. He wants
[25:59.480 --> 26:04.040]  to bring jobs back. The whole establishment's against him. If you're sick of the establishment,
[26:05.560 --> 26:11.960]  you must go for Donald Trump. I mean, they're getting rid of the electoral process. You have
[26:11.960 --> 26:20.280]  to go for the guy that is bucking that. It's a no brainer. They've gotten rid of our families.
[26:21.640 --> 26:25.400]  They've gotten rid of our churches. Now our communities are just groups of basically adult
[26:25.400 --> 26:31.240]  children running around trying to conform to whatever the new cultural guidelines are to be
[26:31.240 --> 26:37.640]  trendy. They're scared. They're poor. They're desperate. And the system's telling them it's
[26:37.640 --> 26:46.040]  cool to be poor. It's cool to be ignorant. I have been on Facebook just randomly searching
[26:46.040 --> 26:52.840]  random profiles just to see what's going on out there with trendies. And many of them will have
[26:52.840 --> 26:58.280]  links to info wars going, look at this racist kook. They've got a screenshot on my phone.
[27:00.520 --> 27:07.160]  He says, Pokemon is a government conspiracy. Pokemon, or I know I pronounced it wrong on purpose,
[27:08.680 --> 27:15.640]  pocket monster, Okimon was set up with a grant directed to Western intelligence agencies.
[27:15.640 --> 27:22.200]  Google Earth live time tracks everywhere you are sending a video back to Google
[27:23.080 --> 27:27.320]  who had trucks all over the country in the world breaking into people's pass codes,
[27:27.320 --> 27:29.640]  getting into their computers and downloading their databases.
[27:31.480 --> 27:36.120]  Now they have driverless cars with these masked and video cameras and code breakers,
[27:36.120 --> 27:39.720]  literal imperial probe droids, robot cars driving around,
[27:40.360 --> 27:43.720]  jacking and stealing everything off your computer. And they don't get in trouble
[27:43.720 --> 27:51.320]  because they're an arm of the government. Major tech companies admit they're watching
[27:51.320 --> 27:55.800]  and listening to you at your house. We told people that 15 years ago with the patents,
[27:55.800 --> 28:00.120]  with the press releases from Google to their shareholders and people didn't believe it.
[28:00.120 --> 28:02.440]  Now it's like, okay, yeah, my TV's watching me big deal.
[28:06.040 --> 28:11.560]  You go get a new smart TV. And when you fire it up, it says read the contract or click here.
[28:11.560 --> 28:14.840]  You go read, there's 20, 30, 40 pages of contract depending on the TV.
[28:16.120 --> 28:18.920]  Like I just bought one a few months ago and went and looked at it. I'm gonna do a whole
[28:18.920 --> 28:24.200]  report on it. And it says right there, we will share audio and video of what's going on in your
[28:24.200 --> 28:32.680]  house with third parties. So watch what you do. Oh my gosh. I mean, whoa, we played the video
[28:32.680 --> 28:39.240]  tutorial here on here where Samsung says watch what you do. It doesn't matter.
[28:39.240 --> 28:44.920]  I'm on these Facebooks. These people will have history degrees, art degrees, jobs,
[28:45.560 --> 28:52.520]  and they're making jokes about us warning them. And we were the first. Meanwhile, CNN comes out
[28:52.520 --> 28:58.680]  and says your TV may be watching you decades after I told you. And that's what I'm getting at here is
[28:59.800 --> 29:06.120]  this isn't about liberal or conservative. This is about autism going from one and 30 something
[29:06.120 --> 29:11.560]  thousand 35 years ago to one and 58. There's only one country takes more vaccines the United States
[29:11.560 --> 29:18.440]  and that's South Korea. They're one in 24. They got warehouses in every neighborhood,
[29:18.440 --> 29:22.520]  a kids that are 10, 15 years old wearing diapers,
[29:24.840 --> 29:31.000]  throwing crap on the walls. They're gone. They got hit and hit hard. And it's a soft kill program
[29:31.000 --> 29:35.000]  where we just kill our kids brains right in front of everybody and nobody cares. We just accept
[29:35.000 --> 29:42.840]  that soon it'll be one in three by 2025. That's even the ministry of health, the health service
[29:42.840 --> 29:50.600]  in England. I mean, whoa, that matter. Trendy's just make jokes. It's all funny. We're on the march.
[29:50.600 --> 29:55.960]  The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:00.040 --> 30:02.840]  What's likely another attempt to downplay Islamic terrorism?
[30:02.840 --> 30:06.600]  London authorities covered up an attempted car bombing on Saturday night. According to a source
[30:06.600 --> 30:11.240]  who reached out to InfoWars, Camden Locke, a popular area for clubgoers, was evacuated by
[30:11.240 --> 30:15.960]  police after a report about a suspicious vehicle at 10.50pm local time as reported by Paul Joseph
[30:15.960 --> 30:20.120]  Watson. Metropolitan police sent in a bomb robot that checked the car and sequentially announced
[30:20.120 --> 30:24.760]  that the vehicle was not deemed too suspicious and officers were stood down. However, according to
[30:24.760 --> 30:28.760]  an employee who works at one of the venues that was evacuated, he saw information that suggests
[30:28.760 --> 30:33.320]  the incident was in fact an attempted terrorist attack. The bomb was real, he said, adding that
[30:33.320 --> 30:37.720]  the device contained shrapnel and that the car was filled with gas canisters. Additionally,
[30:37.720 --> 30:42.280]  the vehicle had no registered owner and no insurance. The employee also said, quote,
[30:42.280 --> 30:46.280]  the car was parked in a very high traffic area with busy clubs and pubs all around,
[30:46.280 --> 30:50.440]  including a sold out open air event. If it went off, a lot of people wouldn't have made it home
[30:50.440 --> 30:53.960]  that night. The mainstream media won't report on it, so maybe you will. And for more news,
[30:53.960 --> 30:58.600]  the mainstream media won't cover out of fear of political correctness. Visit infowars.com. This is
[30:58.600 --> 31:03.960]  Kit Daniels reporting. More than two years ago, info wars first told you about our research into
[31:03.960 --> 31:08.840]  what has been called the iodine conspiracy. I've told you about how scientists have known for decades
[31:08.840 --> 31:14.760]  that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine
[31:14.760 --> 31:19.480]  out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water. They
[31:19.480 --> 31:25.000]  took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in. And when the Fukushima crisis worsened,
[31:25.000 --> 31:29.960]  as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[31:29.960 --> 31:36.280]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine
[31:36.280 --> 31:42.200]  and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning
[31:42.200 --> 31:46.760]  iodine. You can pull these studies up for yourself. This is the real deal, folks. And the truth is
[31:46.760 --> 31:53.080]  that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival Shield X2

[32:58.120 --> 33:27.400]  I just watched a video of the DNC that I missed where this preacher was bringing everybody in
[33:27.400 --> 33:32.760]  for a one-world religion. And here in my stack, I've got the Pope calling for a one-world religion
[33:33.960 --> 33:40.120]  and for a new man, a new form of human that sees no differences and has open borders.
[33:41.000 --> 33:44.920]  Of course, they don't tell you who's going to run the world government that sits over the nation
[33:44.920 --> 33:52.600]  states because once it's in place, they will begin testing the bio weapons on the population
[33:52.600 --> 34:00.280]  as I've told you forever and use the Olympics as a rollout for it. This particular one in the
[34:00.280 --> 34:07.480]  aggregate is a PSYOP. 1954, the Rockefeller Foundation patented it and weaponized Zika.
[34:07.480 --> 34:13.000]  It's since mutated thanks to mosquitoes they've released. Oh, an accident. What could go wrong?
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.960]  And it's spreading. And yes, it's sexually transmitted or transmitted by saliva or other
[34:17.960 --> 34:23.800]  bodily fluid. And there's a Zika emergency. That's the headline at drugsreport.com. Zika
[34:23.800 --> 34:31.000]  emergency in Florida. 10 more people likely contracted Zika from mosquitoes. Governor
[34:31.000 --> 34:38.440]  Rick Scott asked CDC to activate emergency response teams. And remember, remember old Bill Gates a
[34:38.440 --> 34:43.080]  few years ago releasing at a TED talk, releasing a bunch of mosquitoes, live ones and laughing
[34:43.080 --> 34:49.560]  at everybody. He's got a bunch of patents on vaccines delivered by mosquito and other little
[34:49.560 --> 34:59.960]  goodies. So we're going to be obviously getting into that report. But before I go any further,
[35:01.160 --> 35:08.040]  we have ended the big mega sale, the biggest in our history. Every item, basically the lowest

[38:03.880 --> 38:17.160]  but for me, this is central. The video is titled the video is titled
[38:19.480 --> 38:26.680]  Donald Trump, an emergency message to Donald Trump. And we're going to play it here in just a moment
[38:26.680 --> 38:35.320]  because it deals, we play right off YouTube again, so I'm going to play it. The video deals with the
[38:35.320 --> 38:41.640]  fact that the globalists are openly trying to steal the election, the fact that the globalists
[38:41.640 --> 38:46.600]  have already been rigging things and that Hillary is completely discredited and completely dishonored
[38:46.600 --> 38:50.440]  by the fact that she stole the election Bernie Sanders. And I'm not going to drop this and the
[38:50.440 --> 38:54.200]  American people aren't going to drop this. And I can tell you the Trump folks understand how important
[38:54.200 --> 39:00.760]  this is and they're not going to drop it. So we need a referendum, a giant landslide
[39:02.200 --> 39:05.160]  against the globalists to repudiate what they've done.
[39:09.400 --> 39:18.120]  It's just that simple. And it's something that if we don't do it, it absolutely sets the precedent
[39:18.120 --> 39:23.720]  where they can do whatever they want, whenever they want, however they want, and things just get
[39:23.720 --> 39:27.720]  worse and worse. They're already talking about arresting people for their peaceful speech.
[39:27.720 --> 39:31.480]  They're already talking about national forced labor like Venezuela's brought in.
[39:31.480 --> 39:35.000]  They're already talking about national compulsory service, not just in the military,
[39:35.000 --> 39:41.880]  but in social justice warrior garbage. This is all the telltale signs, all the red flags,
[39:41.880 --> 39:48.360]  all the evidence, the signature of hardcore tyranny. And then I'm going to get into the
[39:48.360 --> 39:54.680]  pope calling for a one world religion and a lot more. But here is the video report that's up on
[39:54.680 --> 40:03.400]  infowars.com. I'm going to have it reposted and sent out to everybody because it is so key
[40:04.200 --> 40:08.120]  as the grassroots to force this issue out there in the open and to reach out to the
[40:08.120 --> 40:12.840]  Bernie Sanders people and say, are you total chumps? He betrayed you. He scams you. He let
[40:12.840 --> 40:17.720]  her rob you. They tried to rob Trump like this, but he stood up against it. That's why they're
[40:17.720 --> 40:23.080]  against him. He agrees with Sanders on trade and on the big banks and so many issues. What is your
[40:23.080 --> 40:29.720]  problem? She is the corrupt element of Wall Street candidate. She is the Goldman Sachs JP Morgan
[40:29.720 --> 40:35.960]  Minion. She is the plague. And there's another interview I did on this with Roger Stone yesterday
[40:35.960 --> 40:40.280]  titled Roger Stone, Hillary plans to seal election. We break it down there as well.
[40:40.280 --> 40:45.880]  This is so important if you want to beat her, not just to stop election fraud that day,
[40:45.880 --> 40:51.560]  but to turn everyone against her by pointing out what a crook she is. This is just one more
[40:51.560 --> 40:56.200]  corruption, but she can try to twist the email stuff or twist all the other garbage. She can't do
[40:56.200 --> 41:01.880]  this. Bernie Sanders won and they had the super delegates ignore it. So let's go ahead and go
[41:01.880 --> 41:05.560]  to this special report. An emergency message to Donald Trump. Please spread everyone you know.
[41:05.560 --> 41:09.000]  Alex Jones here with an extremely important message to Donald Trump,
[41:09.000 --> 41:13.000]  the people of the United States, the people of the world. Crooked Hillary Clinton has openly
[41:13.000 --> 41:17.480]  sold the nomination of Bernie Sanders. Mr. Trump, I'm not going to lay things out here that you
[41:17.480 --> 41:25.320]  don't already know, but I am going to ask you to seriously think about making the issue of
[41:25.320 --> 41:32.120]  Hillary's election fraud in the primaries, one of the central issues to defeating her in November.
[41:32.920 --> 41:38.680]  I have interviewed all the top election fraud experts, whether it's from low level retail
[41:38.680 --> 41:43.240]  voter fraud or election fraud with the black box voting machines. And the evidence is clear,
[41:43.880 --> 41:51.400]  only landslides can defeat major election fraud. And as your polls go up and up and up seven,
[41:51.400 --> 41:57.480]  10 points against Hillary, as people learn how corrupt she is and how corrupt she has been,
[41:57.480 --> 42:03.960]  your numbers are only going to go up. They know you are the real leader. They know you should be
[42:03.960 --> 42:08.680]  the next president of the United States. And they're going to try to block you. When the mainstream
[42:08.680 --> 42:14.120]  media ridiculed Donald Trump and said he was a sore loser, that he shouldn't talk about Ted Cruz
[42:14.840 --> 42:19.480]  canceling elections and having voterless victories in the primaries. Yes, it was sensational when he
[42:19.480 --> 42:23.960]  came out and said, I'm winning these states, but they're giving the delegates to Ted Cruz.
[42:23.960 --> 42:29.160]  In some cases, they would just cancel elections in many states and just give him all the delegates.
[42:29.160 --> 42:35.240]  So we have a rigged system. So in Colorado, they were going to vote. And you saw what's
[42:35.240 --> 42:42.200]  happened in Colorado. It's one of the big things. It's a fix because we thought we were having an
[42:42.200 --> 42:51.320]  election and a number of months ago, they decided to do it by, you know what, right? Right? They
[42:51.320 --> 42:57.000]  said we'll do it by delegate. They said they're going to do it by delegate. Oh, is that nice?
[42:57.000 --> 43:03.240]  And the delegates were all there, all waiting. And the head guy, in fact, one of them tweeted
[43:03.240 --> 43:07.880]  out today or said today by mistake, and then they withdrew it, something to the effect.
[43:07.880 --> 43:13.560]  See, never Trump. Look what we did. Never Trump. Because if I go to the voters of Colorado, we
[43:13.560 --> 43:18.440]  win Colorado. Donald Trump wasn't intimidated. He came out and said, what do you mean? When I
[43:18.440 --> 43:24.280]  win a state, I should win the delegates. And they had to back down. Sanders didn't do that.
[43:24.280 --> 43:31.960]  And Hillary stole it from him. But Bernie Sanders, I will say this for the last five
[43:31.960 --> 43:39.960]  weeks, you turn on the television. Sanders wins. Sanders wins. Again, Sanders wins.
[43:39.960 --> 43:46.520]  Like seven or eight or nine, he keeps winning. And then you listen to the people in the pundits,
[43:46.520 --> 43:50.920]  and they say he has no chance of winning. I said, what's going on? Because you have super
[43:50.920 --> 43:55.480]  delegates. By the way, I think the Republicans have a worse system than the Democrats, but
[43:55.480 --> 44:00.600]  they have super delegates. It makes it impossible for a guy that wins to win.
[44:00.600 --> 44:07.640]  It is imperative that the Trump campaign make this one of the central issues, because it only
[44:07.640 --> 44:13.640]  further documents the organized crime nature of Hillary Rodham Clinton and her crime family.
[44:14.680 --> 44:18.840]  If she stole the primary, she's going to try to steal the general election.
[44:18.840 --> 44:23.240]  So Donald Trump's already done the right thing in the primary. He didn't let the voters have
[44:23.240 --> 44:28.280]  their votes stolen. He didn't let himself and his family be robbed as well. He stood up and said no.
[44:28.840 --> 44:34.760]  And so now Donald Trump needs to really think about what he's going to do. But we have to think
[44:34.760 --> 44:41.400]  about what are we going to do to stop Hillary, who's already stolen the process, who's a fraudulent
[44:41.400 --> 44:46.360]  nominee from stealing the general election? My message to the American people is this.
[44:46.360 --> 44:53.000]  You're having your republic stolen in front of you. Not in our 240 years has there ever been a
[44:53.000 --> 44:59.960]  primary where they openly stole it from a nominee. This is unprecedented. And we need a referendum
[44:59.960 --> 45:05.800]  supporting free and open elections in this country. And that referendum is a landslide for Mr.
[45:05.800 --> 45:13.720]  Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the United States. We've got to call this fraud out for what
[45:13.720 --> 45:18.920]  she is. I know there's this attitude of good sportsmanship. When you're on the field with the
[45:18.920 --> 45:24.120]  Al Capone of politics, Hillary Clinton, you've got to tell it like it is. And Mr. Trump, I know
[45:24.120 --> 45:28.440]  I'm not telling you something you don't know. The reason you are successful is you have courage,
[45:28.440 --> 45:35.960]  you're a maverick, and you're not pulling punches. I'm asking the American people to support you in
[45:35.960 --> 45:41.000]  standing up to this witch. And I'm asking the American people to take action and to really
[45:41.000 --> 45:46.280]  cause a grassroots brush fire, dealing with the issue of black box voting, election fraud,
[45:46.280 --> 45:50.520]  illegals voting and others. Because if you think Hillary's going to stop with stealing the nomination,
[45:51.480 --> 45:55.880]  if you think she's going to try to steal the general election, I got a bridge in Brooklyn
[45:55.880 --> 46:00.920]  I want to sell you. Now this has just been a basic announcement of these messages. I'm going to be
[46:00.920 --> 46:06.760]  following these on a weekly basis with detailed reports, nymphowars.com, documenting everything
[46:06.760 --> 46:11.560]  we're breaking down so that not just Mr. Trump, but the general public can get this information
[46:11.560 --> 46:17.320]  out to everyone we know. I, as a citizen, am standing up for the integrity of my right to vote.
[46:22.840 --> 46:28.600]  By the way, I was so upset about all this that, and just realizing that other people weren't
[46:28.600 --> 46:33.240]  pointing it out, that I've reached out to the campaign in the last week and a half, I've reached
[46:33.240 --> 46:37.160]  out to others and they've said, no, we really appreciate that fact. We're actually on that,
[46:37.160 --> 46:41.720]  but thank you for pinpointing it. And a stone talked about that yesterday on the air, obviously.
[46:43.560 --> 46:49.080]  I'm just letting listeners know that really smart politicos that are patriots agree with me.
[46:49.720 --> 46:53.240]  And they actually agree and say, now that we've thought about it, we do need to get on this
[46:53.240 --> 46:59.320]  earlier instead of later. Because it's not about her trying to steal it that day. She's already
[46:59.320 --> 47:04.600]  stolen a nomination. This is a discrediting issue, a weapon against Hillary that we will use.
[47:06.440 --> 47:12.280]  We have to reach out to the Sanders people pointing out you were robbed. Do you want to go
[47:12.280 --> 47:16.840]  with the person that robbed you or throw your vote away and go vote for the Green Party person?
[47:16.840 --> 47:25.240]  Vote for Donald Trump. Stop being idiots your whole life. Stop being conned your whole life.
[47:25.240 --> 47:33.000]  The whole power structure, the foreign leaders, the globalists are all against Trump. It is a no
[47:33.000 --> 47:41.080]  brainer. All right, now we're going to play a clip coming up in the next hour
[47:41.960 --> 47:46.200]  from the DNC where they were pushing this one world religion stuff. But let me set the table
[47:46.200 --> 47:56.840]  here first. Okay. Report. Authorities cover up London car bomb attack. Top Swedish priest
[47:56.840 --> 48:02.280]  Islamists have declared war on Christianity. Video. Crooked Hillary again calls Benghazi
[48:02.280 --> 48:10.680]  families liars. This is all up on infowars.com. Pull. Americans want total revolution against
[48:10.680 --> 48:16.920]  mass immigration, especially if you got to pay for all the new people. Video. Bernie supporters
[48:16.920 --> 48:24.680]  and Phillies say they're voting for Trump. Trump lambasted over Khan while Clinton gets free pass
[48:24.680 --> 48:29.240]  after lying to Congress and getting money from the Russian government to transfer uranium
[48:29.240 --> 48:35.560]  and weapons systems. She's the real spy, but she sells out to everybody to destabilize the world.
[48:35.560 --> 48:41.080]  Just like specter plays both sides. Just like the real specter, the quantum group, George Soros
[48:41.080 --> 48:47.400]  plays both sides. But here's the news that ties into the one world religion. This all goes together.
[48:48.920 --> 48:50.520]  The Pope has come out and said
[48:54.760 --> 48:59.880]  that Islam has no violence in it and never has. And if you say it does, you're evil.
[48:59.880 --> 49:06.360]  That is totally absolutely ridiculous. Much of Europe fell to Islam and massive invasions.
[49:08.040 --> 49:10.840]  Fearing reprisal from Muslims, French publisher
[49:11.640 --> 49:16.600]  reverses decision to publish book critical of Islam. This is how the intimidation begins.
[49:18.040 --> 49:22.120]  Belgian priest stabbed in his home after refusing to give cash to an asylum seeker.
[49:22.120 --> 49:27.800]  See, they come and say, I'm allowed to kill you because you're a demi or a kaffir, a subhuman.
[49:27.800 --> 49:29.960]  But just give me money and I won't. Well, he didn't. So he's dead.
[49:30.760 --> 49:34.680]  Pope Francis defends Muslims and blasts, quote, Islam, not terrorism.
[49:35.240 --> 49:41.400]  Pope Francis yesterday is wrong to identify Islam with terrorism. It just goes on.
[49:41.400 --> 49:46.440]  Social injustice. And then it spins it that he's identifying it when he says he's not.
[49:51.480 --> 49:57.480]  Speaking abroad, the plane talking him back to Rome after a five day trip to Poland, he said,
[49:57.480 --> 50:02.440]  I think it's not right to identify Islam with terrorism. It's not right. And it's not true.
[50:02.440 --> 50:08.520]  Francis was responding to a question about the killing of July 26, 85 year old Roman Catholic
[50:08.520 --> 50:13.160]  priests by knife wielding attackers who burst into a church. And he just said, Hey, it's not right
[50:13.160 --> 50:17.080]  to say those were Islamists, even though they pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda. I'm going to skip
[50:17.080 --> 50:25.160]  this network break. Pope to young on Poland trip, believe in a new humanity. This is associated
[50:25.160 --> 50:31.560]  press. So Pope Francis defends Muslims and blasts. Islam is not terrorism.
[50:33.400 --> 50:36.360]  And you read that headline, it sounds like he's saying it's wrong to say
[50:37.000 --> 50:40.040]  it's not terrorism. And no, he's actually saying it isn't terrorism and don't say it.
[50:41.160 --> 50:44.440]  It's not right. It's not true as his quote. Francis was responding to a question about the
[50:44.440 --> 50:48.920]  killing on July 26, 85 year old Roman Catholic priests by knife wielding attackers. Yeah,
[50:48.920 --> 50:52.520]  they cut his head off, who burst into a church service in Western France.
[50:52.520 --> 50:58.120]  Yeah, Normandy forced the priest to his knees and slit his throat. Now they cut his head off.
[50:59.000 --> 51:06.760]  Now you want more from the so-called Pope associated press Pope to young on Poland
[51:06.760 --> 51:14.200]  trip, believe in a new humanity. Pope Francis encouraged hundreds of thousands of young people
[51:14.200 --> 51:20.360]  at a global gathering Sunday to believe in a new humanity close quote that is stronger than the evil
[51:20.360 --> 51:26.920]  and refuses to see borders and barriers. See evil sees borders and barriers like a front door
[51:26.920 --> 51:30.280]  in your house or you having privacy or you elect in your own government.
[51:34.840 --> 51:35.560]  Think about this.
[51:40.280 --> 51:46.440]  Think about that. This is the opposite. I mean, he came out a few months ago. I read the quote
[51:46.440 --> 51:50.760]  probably 20 times on air and said it's horrible to say Europe has Christian roots.
[51:50.760 --> 51:54.120]  It's xenophobic and it makes him nauseous. You know, read the quotes.
[51:57.240 --> 52:03.400]  What? And now he says we cannot see borders or barriers like a cult. Just don't even see it.
[52:03.400 --> 52:08.680]  But who runs this new system that doesn't have borders? The global government.
[52:11.400 --> 52:15.560]  The EU is already run by the multinationals. This is a system they want worldwide to loot
[52:15.560 --> 52:21.880]  the populations of the Pope. The Jesuit Pope. It's even the London Guardian.
[52:22.680 --> 52:27.720]  They blackmailed the last Pope and basically took the Catholic Church over. I mean, you can
[52:27.720 --> 52:31.560]  clearly say what you want about the church before this or it's different permutations
[52:31.560 --> 52:36.760]  and what it's done and whether it was always bad or always good. But now the Catholic Church is
[52:36.760 --> 52:42.520]  no more. It is run by someone who is a false prophet. Is he the false prophet?
[52:42.520 --> 52:47.560]  I got ABC News saying soon all children will have microchips. You will accept it.
[52:48.280 --> 52:51.400]  And you better believe this guy. I'll tell you to take a microchip. He's calling for
[52:51.400 --> 52:56.600]  cashless society. I mean, I wonder if he's got a little red tail, you know, wrapped up in his shorts.
[52:57.720 --> 53:02.440]  I mean, I have, I mean, if I heard the stuff he says and didn't know who said it, I'd say
[53:02.440 --> 53:05.800]  that's Satan himself. This guy is an abomination.
[53:05.800 --> 53:14.840]  And here's another report. Michael Snyder. It's up on info wars.com.
[53:15.880 --> 53:21.400]  12 times Pope Francis is openly promoted to one world religion or a new world order.
[53:21.400 --> 53:25.560]  He calls for global government. You can read the quotes with links to him.
[53:25.560 --> 53:34.680]  Global government, they had pedophiles take over the Catholic Church, corrupt it.
[53:35.720 --> 53:40.280]  The church then covered it up, made the wrong move, and then it got blackmailed for a total
[53:40.280 --> 53:45.880]  takeover. He says that we should welcome Sunni clerics into our country. We should build mosque,
[53:45.880 --> 53:53.080]  all of this. And of course, it's Sunnis he's allied with because that's who Saudi Arabia runs.
[53:53.080 --> 53:57.240]  That's the blood drinkers. That's the heart eaters. That's the folks that sell little girls into slavery.
[54:01.400 --> 54:04.760]  Not peace though. He brings in the invasion to bring down Christendom.
[54:06.120 --> 54:11.480]  Other popes literally at the gates of Vienna and the gates of Rome, they have 200 foot walls
[54:11.480 --> 54:17.720]  in Vatican City because of the Muslim invasions. It's a fact. Let's admit it. It's going on. Let's
[54:17.720 --> 54:33.400]  admit it. Unbelievable. All right. Let's shift gears into other news, but first we do have a clip
[54:33.400 --> 54:39.000]  from the DNC with this preacher, this priest, getting up with the Clintons and saying the
[54:39.000 --> 54:49.560]  God of all peoples. Yes, there is a place in our heart for God. And yes, Christ said,
[54:49.560 --> 54:53.240]  I have many flocks and I can tell you there's been people, poor pygmies out in the middle of nowhere
[54:53.240 --> 54:59.560]  that never heard about Christ that had a loving heart that God loved. But to sit there and say
[54:59.560 --> 55:04.440]  all religions follow the same God. No, the Aztecs were cutting people's hearts out and selling the
[55:04.440 --> 55:11.320]  meat. That's not the same God. The Nazis worshiped a cult of death and weird Tibetan black magic.
[55:11.320 --> 55:17.560]  That's not the same God. And when they tell you it's all the same God, it's not.
[55:20.760 --> 55:21.800]  It's not the same God.
[55:25.960 --> 55:28.280]  And when you start hearing this, it's the one world government
[55:28.280 --> 55:36.120]  where they're going to bring in incompatible religions and then make us all accept that we
[55:36.120 --> 55:40.280]  can't criticize anything and we're arrested. That's what revelation says. And maybe you don't
[55:40.280 --> 55:45.080]  believe revelations is real. Fine. It's been used as a blueprint of control and is being implemented.
[55:50.200 --> 55:53.720]  It's happening. The elite believe they're going to merge with machines and become immortal.
[55:53.720 --> 56:00.120]  What does the devil offer them in revelations eternal life through his systems?
[56:01.880 --> 56:07.240]  Everyone in the world can watch the beast at once as a moving creature in everyone's home,
[56:07.800 --> 56:11.800]  a hologram. All of this is coming into place. All of this is happening.
[56:13.560 --> 56:18.280]  Was it some type of missionary protector it pre-planning it getting us ready for a plan?
[56:18.280 --> 56:25.560]  Okay. It had to come from somewhere else. Humans didn't cook this up. Look at what we face. It's
[56:25.560 --> 56:37.240]  real. Let's go to this club. Here it is. Hold the hand of someone next to you. Let us pray.
[56:38.280 --> 56:46.360]  Oh God of many names. We know that you call us to work hard to bring people together.
[56:46.360 --> 56:56.440]  We pray. Lord, we allow your love to overcome our fears as we learn to respect the other and
[56:56.440 --> 57:05.560]  to treat the most vulnerable of our society just as we do our friends. Lord, we ask you to open
[57:05.560 --> 57:15.240]  our minds to discern the complex issues of our communities, our nation and our world. Give us
[57:15.240 --> 57:24.760]  the courage to move onward and upward to become a better nation. May we as the founder of Methodism,
[57:24.760 --> 57:30.360]  John Wesley talk. All right. Let's stop right there. Let's stop. I have been to Methodist churches
[57:30.360 --> 57:33.560]  all my life because my family went to Baptist churches, but also some Methodist churches.
[57:34.520 --> 57:41.000]  The Methodist churches that I have been to in the last decade are literal government run systems
[57:41.000 --> 57:47.000]  to change agent people week by week and brainwash them and take their Christian love and direct
[57:47.000 --> 57:51.800]  it towards the status God. And that is exactly what you're hearing. This is ecumenicalism,
[57:52.360 --> 57:56.520]  world council of churches, national council of churches. It is the Rockefeller takeover
[57:56.520 --> 58:01.800]  of the churches. And it doesn't matter. People have a spiritual connection. They get you in
[58:01.800 --> 58:07.080]  and it doesn't matter even if it's family. They will not listen. They get a crazy look in their eye
[58:07.080 --> 58:13.320]  and they're gone. And Methodist churches across the country. They're now removing the cross
[58:13.320 --> 58:19.800]  because it's seen as offensive. Started in San Francisco three years ago. It's now spreading
[58:19.800 --> 58:25.880]  to Austin, the rest of the country. This is who they are. They mean business. We're going to open
[58:25.880 --> 58:29.880]  the phones up in the next hour and cover a bunch of other news I haven't gotten to yet.
[58:29.880 --> 58:38.600]  The toll free numbers 800-25-99-231 first time callers are up first 800-25-99-231.
[58:38.600 --> 58:41.400]  Will they try to steal the election? Will they try to bring in civil emergency?

[58:49.880 --> 58:53.880]  Brainforce, it's completely different. Try a bottle of it. Rob do,
[58:53.880 --> 58:58.920]  joins us. You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours. Tell us what brainforce did.
[58:58.920 --> 59:04.280]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8.30.
[59:04.280 --> 59:08.040]  I was kind of run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it. And I really
[59:08.040 --> 59:11.880]  wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of brainforce right there. I popped two
[59:11.880 --> 59:17.160]  of them. And about 20 minutes later, it's like bing. Everything just kind of clears up. Got four
[59:17.160 --> 59:21.720]  and a half stars. People really love it. Read about it. Find out why third party
[59:21.720 --> 59:26.520]  nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic
[59:26.520 --> 59:30.680]  based systems that will blow your socks off. I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a
[59:30.680 --> 59:35.000]  while, but I probably could not have done it without brainforce. I went home about 6.45 this
[59:35.000 --> 59:40.280]  morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brainforce and came in. You will find
[59:40.280 --> 59:58.760]  brainforce and other game changing products at info wars life.com or call 888-253-3139.

[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:36.840]  to the different Patriot groups in the 50s and 60s that discovered the world government plan.
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:43.160]  It was actually being taught in colleges to the next generation of managers and technocrats.
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:51.720]  Chiefly among them were the John Burt society. They were the evil right wingers that were
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:01:01.480]  against the Vietnam War because they laid out the plan from their own documents for a one world
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:08.440]  religion, a one world army, a one world court, a one world bank, and then every facet of your life
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:18.360]  dictated to you by the central cultural destructors, they call themselves engineers.
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:24.840]  And you look at it, man, they have built it. They're about 15 years behind,
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:31.800]  but now they are massively accelerating it. They're just doing it no matter what happens.
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:38.840]  And so I keep saying they're about 15 years behind. That's their own admission.
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.840]  They've been saying they've been 15 years behind for about 20, 30 years, but now I'd say
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:48.760]  seven, eight, nine years behind. They've accelerated so much the last five, six years.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:57.480]  It's fundamental transformative change. And they've set up a cult, man. You get around
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:04.840]  trendies. You get around Fortune 500 businesses and it's women all in charge, marching around,
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:09.720]  letting you know they're in charge. They get all the management jobs. They're the professionals.
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:13.320]  And you could argue in cultures, yeah, men were generally the hunters or, you know,
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:17.240]  in the more dangerous jobs, whatever, men are in charge. The point is it's artificially being
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:23.320]  overthrown. They've broken up the family. They're only bringing women into positions of power to
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:26.680]  end the family, just like the Romans would bring in house slaves.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:33.160]  I said, Walter Williams, I forget, like 20 years ago, there was an editorial I heard
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:38.440]  Rush Limbaugh talking about and actually had to go to this news stand place called news.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:44.040]  One half of it was news. The other half of the place was like pornography, but as a news guy,
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:50.200]  that's where I'd have to go to, they had hundreds of newspapers. It was when the internet wasn't
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:57.880]  really that big in like 95, 96. So I would go every couple of days and just get the Chicago
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:00.360]  Tribune, you know, all these different newspapers that you couldn't get in Austin.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:04.760]  And I remember going and getting the newspaper I heard Limbaugh talk about.
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:10.520]  I was my own producer and it was, it was, it was one of the black philosopher,
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:15.640]  lawyer commentators, I forget which one. And it was a whole article about a manual
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:21.160]  that had been translated out of Latin that was over 2,000 years old by French sugarcane
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:25.000]  slave plantation owners. If somebody can find this send it to me because I can't find it.
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:32.120]  And I saw references to it in other history books before, but he had it. And, and he was going over,
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:35.160]  was it Cal Thomas or Walter Williams?
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:38.600]  They were going over
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:45.240]  how they were explaining and they translated it into English now. It was being used by slave
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:52.040]  owners 200 something years ago in the United States or then the colonies about how you get
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:56.600]  people off the slave ships, you take whoever the obvious leader is and you beat them to death.
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:02.040]  And you tell the women, he was bad. We're going to kill your children now, your little boys,
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:06.840]  if you don't keep them under our control. And so the women immediately became informants
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:10.680]  and controllers and then they'd be brought in. That's why you see it in all the old movies,
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:15.000]  but in the old original culture where you got the black mammy in the house and she's running the
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.600]  show and the men are outside under her control and why she would even many times dole out the
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:28.840]  discipline. My dad talks about that because he'd be sent for a month here, a month there working
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:32.600]  in a machine shop in Houston or they'd send him for a month to go pick cotton to see what it was
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:37.160]  like. He'd talk about being a little kid picking cotton a couple summers. And that's who the
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:43.240]  foremen were were old big black women over poor whites and blacks in the cotton fields. I'm just
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:47.960]  telling you and that all is out of a Roman manual that they had, mainly white slaves,
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:50.760]  about how they would first, I'm going to explain all this when you come back and then go to your
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:57.480]  calls. That's what all this is. This is classic slavery is what you're seeing right now and women
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:03.720]  are always put in charge. Hillary Clinton suggested the grieving families of victims of the Benghazi
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:07.880]  attacker liars and an appearance on Fox News Sunday. While the corporate media obsessed over
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:12.200]  Donald Trump's response to a fallen soldier from a Muslim immigrant family, Clinton's response to
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:16.760]  Pat Smith over the death of her son in Libya was glossed over as reported by Steve Watson.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:21.480]  Clinton said, quote, I don't hold any ill feeling for someone who in that moment may not fully recall
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:25.640]  everything that was or wasn't said. Now that's a bold statement coming from Hillary's mouth
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:30.200]  considering the FBI revealed she lied numerous times about sending classified information over
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:34.760]  her unsecured private email server. Hillary's suggesting once again that families of the
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:39.080]  Benghazi victims didn't hear her properly when she told them the cause of the attack was an
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:43.160]  anti-Muslim YouTube video that it was not a coordinated pre-planned terror attack.
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:46.760]  But private emails revealed Hillary knows the terrorist attack and additionally the whole
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:50.680]  story about the YouTube video was a state department fabrication that cover up the
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:55.320]  department's role in shipping living weapons to jihadists in Syria via Benghazi. More

[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:04.520]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator but we're waiting for an outrageously
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:09.080]  low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message. Here's why. My friends,
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:13.640]  we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse. So please listen.
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:18.840]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power and unlike gas generators,
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:23.800]  solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun.
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:28.120]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest,
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:31.400]  you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep. And here's
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:36.280]  the best news if you want to get one this week. Solutions from Science has a big sale on their
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:41.480]  fast charge solar generators and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off the
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:46.760]  grid gear in addition to the low price for infowars listeners. So it's a good time to check it out.
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:53.080]  Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com. It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:08:22.920]  with minimum money. Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com. 1776, baby. The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:28.520]  That guitar feeds the soul, doesn't it? Listen to that beauty blasting out.
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.760]  Oh, there's a wind on down the road for global government.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:45.160]  Worldwide extermination. UN officially says 80 percent.
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:54.360]  French Phillips says 80 percent. Ted Turner says 90 percent. I've had the higher level bioweapons technicians
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:04.120]  openly say we're going to wipe everybody out. Even make movies with Bruce Willis to throw it in your face
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:09.880]  and getting you ready for the sacrifice of humanity on the altar of Satan.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:20.200]  Do you have the strength to admit it's happening? Or is it too over the top for you to face?
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:33.320]  All right. I want to go to your phone calls. I had Joel Scowsen joining us. I was going off into
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:40.680]  modern third wave feminism that has always been about in their own manuals, their own training books,
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:44.840]  on record to end the family as we know it. I mean, that's in the textbooks that it's archaic,
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:50.040]  get rid of it. It's horrible. And that women are better than men as if we're not all the same species
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:53.960]  and haven't been through this whole thing together and love each other. And they use
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:10:03.320]  case point examples to create a tribalism within the family unit itself. The ultimate divide and conquer.
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:10.280]  And going back to the Romans, they would say go into Germania or go into Gaul or go into
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:17.320]  Brittany. And they would generally just kill all the adult males because, you know, they're not
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:22.200]  going to submit. They're never being at their own farm with their own wife and kids. They're
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:26.280]  going to get mad when you're raping their wife and you're selling your daughters and sons off.
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:30.120]  So they'd kill everybody above the age of 10. All males above the age of 10 would be killed.
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:37.640]  And then they would take usually a five or six year old boy who they claim had misbehaved and
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:42.440]  they would torture him to death in front of the women. A lot of times they take four or five hours
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:46.440]  to get that job done. It's in the manuals. There's different ones out there. This is in
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:52.680]  mainline history. You can go look it up for yourself. And then they tell the women with their
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:59.800]  interpreter. The Romans always had their sub cohorts that were made up of local contingents
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:05.240]  that they'd actually trained back in Rome and brought back. And they'd tell them, listen,
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:10.440]  you ever let one of your boys or girls or anything wrong or not what we say,
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:16.520]  we're going to kill three or four of them. And what did mama become instantly at that point?
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:23.640]  The ultimate enforcer. The women are brought in the house. The men are kept out in the barn,
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:28.440]  not allowed to learn or read. And within a generation or two, it becomes permanent slave
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:36.840]  classes. There were some slaves in Rome, five, six, seven generations. The women could be scribes
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:40.680]  and write and do everything and would even be the most trusted people. They would be called
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:43.400]  legates for the family. They would be sent on long missions.
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:52.680]  And the men would be out of the barn and weren't even allowed to know how to basically talk.
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:12:00.360]  That was taken in Latin, into French, into the Caribbean, and put into place there,
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:04.760]  and then brought into the United States. And when you see all this, that's what it is.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:11.640]  Period. And so when you see LBJ and the Great Leap Forward and the Great Society and all that
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:18.040]  garbage, that's what that is, is ending families. And you see within two generations,
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:27.000]  almost complete devastation. These are sciences of control. And if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:36.680]  It's pretty amazing, isn't it? And Pope Francis is called for world government again. He said
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:41.720]  Islam is never violent, never bad, bring more in. And that it's horrible if you criticize Islam.
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:45.400]  I read that last hour and played the clips. He says we should have a new humanity,
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:50.840]  quote, without borders or barriers who cannot see them. But that means you're ruled by global
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:13:02.200]  government. It's on, ladies and gentlemen, everyone is joining Sauron to use that as an allegory right
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:15.800]  now, except for Russia and Donald Trump and UKIP and Info Wars and Drudge and others who are insane
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:27.800]  and who are informed. Radical Islam is being allowed in everywhere to take over.
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:33.960]  As I predicted years ago, it's not hard so that we have to conform to it and get rid of our free
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:39.800]  speech because it's our fault when they attack us or kill us. And now we've gone beyond 1984,
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:43.880]  changing the names of attackers from Ali to David and saying they're not Islamic,
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:53.320]  even as they pledge allegiance to ISIS and Al Qaeda. So it is a false flag.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:57.560]  And then groups out there misrepresent what I'm saying
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:04.120]  and say that I'm not saying it's a false flag. Our governments are illegitimate,
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:07.800]  they open the door, they're bringing the people in, they run the whole show.
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:14.040]  Halan and Merkel and all of them, Merkel has declared permanent civil emergency and put
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:18.760]  troops on the streets. They changed the German law since 1945 that they can't use troops to
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:23.160]  suppress population. They've arrested more than 20,000 people the last two years that mildly
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:38.440]  criticize Islam and giving them giant multi-thousand euro fines. Europe is like the new Soviet Union.
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:48.040]  Meanwhile, look at this report and then I'm taking your phone calls. In fact, I'm going to cover this
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:54.120]  once. Scouts and charges exclusive from right Bart up on drugreport.com. NSA architect, I should
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:59.080]  have asked you this when he was on last week, William Benning, has, says the NSA has all of
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:05.560]  Clinton's emails. Of course they do. And that's the thing in law. Couldn't you go to the NSA and
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:09.080]  make them show that you were somewhere else than where they claim when you're under a murder
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:11.960]  investigation or something? But not anymore. And of course you say, well, that's a secret,
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:15.480]  we're not going to let you use it. If you're going to spy on everybody, why don't you at
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:19.240]  least let it prove we didn't do it? We see, see, no, it's all for evil intent.
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:27.720]  They won't even check the IDs or the passports of the quote immigrants and the migrants and the
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:34.520]  refugees that are coming in because they're not refugees. They're the families and the young
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:41.240]  fighting men, 80% of them being military age, that's the little telltale sign. They got kicked,
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:47.320]  they got their butt kicked. They announced Sunday, London Telegraph, but it was this article about
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:52.360]  how mean it is. Jihadi's returning from fighting in Libya and Syria and Chechny and other areas
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:57.320]  that were allowed to go by MI6. They're going to have to go to sensitivity training for a one-week
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:03.000]  class when they get back. No, they should be arrested for fighting with ISIS when they get
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:11.480]  back, but see, the media spins it like those poor little babies. And now in many areas, the majority
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:15.400]  of the time when you get a knock on the door about your kid playing in the backyard in England or
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:20.760]  didn't take your vaccine or you said something political, it's an Islamist who can barely speak
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:25.880]  English and they know they're in charge and they know a deal's been made and they come from countries
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:29.720]  where it's all about political sub-refuge and it's all about who you backstab and it's all about
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:35.320]  working with the state and it's all about being cutthroat. As our media tells us, they're so
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:44.120]  virtuous, they're so loving. They're the new enforcer in Europe.
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:53.640]  Julian Assange, oh, the big liberal, a real liberal. Hacked emails include info on Hillary's
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:58.760]  arming of Johannes, including ISIS and Syria, but we know she did that, but yes, they've got them.
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:01.320]  He says they're about to be released. Good. Release them now.
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:09.000]  Hillary Clinton denied she knew about weapons shipments during public testimony under oath
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.800]  in 2013 after Benghazi terrorist attack. Senator Rand Paul questioned Hillary Clinton about the
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:17.720]  gun-running program back in 2013 during her testimony on the Benghazi terrorist attack.
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:23.160]  Assange told Democracy Now, the WikiLeaks, DNC emails contains information on the weapons
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:26.840]  shipments to Syria. We already know from people that did it. We had the whistleblowers on.
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:29.560]  It's now been admitted they were arming them.
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:38.440]  And then it gets worse. The Clinton Foundation, state and Kremlin connections.
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:45.000]  Why did Hillary State Department urge U.S. investors to fund Russia's research for military
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:51.160]  uses and give them uranium? And her own chief of staff got 35 million from a Putin group to
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:18:01.640]  transfer weapons. You ask, why would they do stuff like this? Because the globalist are weapons
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:04.280]  merchants and they want to play both sides of the equation.
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:12.760]  And they've always got technology a couple generations ahead of it. And they're all tricked
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:17.000]  by the spirit of this world that they're going to somehow manage all this and control all this
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:22.520]  when really they're just going to destroy the planet, which is what the devil is out to do.
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:31.960]  But not until the globalists supposedly have their artificial transcendent technology
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:37.080]  to merge and become binary silicon life forms. And I know the New York Times and everybody
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:41.400]  makes jokes when I talk about that. I'm quoting the head of Google technology development,
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:47.960]  Kurzweil. I'm quoting here the cosmology, the religion of the controllers.
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:51.640]  We're going to go to break and come right back with your phone calls.
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:55.560]  And we'll take calls continually while Scowze and Zahn with us.

[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:07.800]  I put a tablespoon of the Andreas 5-seat oil in my morning one-world-way drink and was still happy
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:12.760]  and energized at 3 p.m. Normally, I feel tired and spacey at the end of the day. But today,
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:17.720]  I felt energy and very clear. My friend at the farmers market asked what I was on. She said,
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:22.600]  my eyes look bright and I had unusual energy for that time of afternoon. I told her there was a
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:27.880]  magical oil that enabled my body to absorb the sun's energy as if I were a plant. She said,
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:33.400]  I want some. A second one-world-way shake with the oil when I got home took me to bedtime with
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:39.160]  that wonderful abundant energy. I couldn't believe how much I got done and how great I felt. The
[01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:44.680]  combination of one-world-way and 5-seat oil produced a significant health event in my life.

[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:50.760]  This is, is this Alex? Yes, sir. You're on the air worldwide.
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:57.880]  Hey, hey, much respect to you. Thank you so much for taking my call. I'm a veteran out of
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:04.520]  Washington state. I'm actually from Oregon, Grand Pass, Oregon, and served 12 years with
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:10.200]  Twyrac. God bless you, brother. Yeah, I got the, got some great news for you, though. I got the
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:18.120]  anthrax vaccine in Germany in 2002. And then shortly thereafter started suffering some pretty bad
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:26.280]  blisters. And they kind of like discarded it as, you know, it was just autoimmune disorder called
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:35.240]  erythemia, multiforma. And then in 2012, after I got out, I had a severe reaction
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:42.360]  that caused blisters all over my body. And once that went down, they started doing, you know,
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:47.240]  biopsies on me. The VA did a little bit more research on it. And they come to find out this
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:51.800]  last year, after being hospitalized for three days, there was a disease called Bechet's disease.
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:57.240]  And Bechet's is like an extreme neurological disorder that causes, you know, brain lesions.
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:01.320]  No, I know what it is. Gardasil does this to people, too. This is a standard of that.
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:05.640]  That's an experimental vaccine. They had to stop doing it three times. They are literally soft
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:10.440]  killing the troops. It doesn't protect you from anthrax. We've covered this extensively. It's
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:14.200]  horrible. And I'm so sorry they did that to you. Of course, they'll tell you there's no side
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:18.600]  effects. It's totally safe, even though the insert says this is experimental and only by order of
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:23.800]  the Department of Defense. And then they basically said, Hey, if you don't get this shot, you're
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:29.000]  going to spend 24 hours on CQ duty. You know, and we just said, I was the guy back then where the
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.760]  only thing I wanted to do was serve my country. I mean, I didn't care about going and killing
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:37.000]  people 9 11 to just happen. Sure. I understand. So sir, you're saying goodness. This sounds like
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.440]  bad news. What happened? Well, the good news is that so this last year, you know, I had a really
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:47.400]  heart to heart with God basically came down to saying, All right, well, this is your body.
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:52.200]  This is your soul. This is your country. All right. So how are you going to fix your countries?
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:56.840]  You cannot fix yourself. And it was at the point where I was hearing, you know, delusional voices
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:00.440]  and the VA kept on saying, Well, it's just a skin disorder. That's post-traumatic stress
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:05.400]  disorder. You might have another problem with your brain or, you know, you have an autoimmune
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:09.800]  thing on the brain. Yeah. Correct. Right. Well, all these manifestations started happening. It
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:14.440]  basically got to the point where it's like, God, I'm hearing these voices. I don't know if it's you
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:19.720]  or if it's something else out there. I need clarity. And so it came down to the point where it's like,
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:25.800]  I wanted to just kill myself. You know, I mean, you call it the 1 800 suicide line and they,
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:29.960]  the first thing they ask you, they don't even ask you your name. They ask you, Are you suicidal?
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:33.960]  Every human being right now, they're trying to get you in the system. They're trying to not
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:39.480]  give you hope and they want you to kill yourself at these systems. But that's why we have record
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:46.120]  suicide 24 a day. So what else happened? So basically what it occurred was the only thing
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:50.360]  that kept me grounded was psychedelics, to be honest with you. And I'd only been starting
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:56.040]  psychedelics to integrate into a therapy called holographic, holographic epistemology.
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:01.320]  And epistemology is obviously the history of, you know, the grounded root that the logos,
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:05.800]  you know, the spirit of the ancient, you know, So what happened? I mean, were you able spiritually
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:11.320]  to transcend this or what happened? Yes, absolutely. So it basically came down to
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:16.360]  two different things was my own personal history and my bad habits. So it was basically I had to
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:22.520]  control my habits in my life, introduced, you know, I looked at the supplements you started
[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:26.680]  using on your website. I was really short on cash and I had to figure out some alternative.
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:29.720]  I was homeless, you know, running around the country living out of my car.
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:38.280]  And I realized, you know, I was putting in so much bad junk into my system to include bad,
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:45.880]  bad information, bad reading, bad top, everything was so wrong. And so it wasn't that I was
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:50.440]  seeing it myself, but something was being introduced into my diet that was actually
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:54.280]  making me say, Okay, absolutely, it all works together. We're almost out of time, brother.
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:58.840]  We're taking calls here and I appreciate your testimony. What it comes down to is I'll be out
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:03.720]  of a party with my kids and I'll see the Doritos with MSG. I tell them don't eat it, they eat it
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:08.440]  and then they act like demons. I mean, as long as they don't get Aspartame or MSG or red dye
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:13.560]  number, whatever, they're great kids. And this is all pharmacia. This is how the global is
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:17.560]  controlled us. We got 30 seconds. How did it end, my friend? I love your testimony.
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:23.000]  We developed a technology in Chicago based upon holographic projectionism.
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.480]  It's a new technology. Well, send me some info. I appreciate your call. We have a lot of callers
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:31.560]  here. Corey wants to talk about Drudge headline and Hillary and emails. We got Peter wants to
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:36.040]  talk about the election. Christian wants to talk about Trump, Russia hacked emails. Michael wants
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:41.000]  to talk about assassination of Trump. So we'll talk about all of that and then we're going to be
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:46.360]  getting on the line. Joel Scowles in the World Affairs Brief. Stay with us. I'm Alex Jones in

[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:03.880]  What's likely another attempt to downplay Islamic terrorism? London authorities covered
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:07.560]  up an attempted car bombing on Saturday night. According to a source who reached out to info
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:12.200]  wars, Camden lock, a popular area for clubgoers was evacuated by police after report about a
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:17.080]  suspicious vehicle attempt to DPM local time as reported by apologize Watson. Metropolitan
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:21.080]  police sent in a bomb robot to check the car and sequentially announced that the vehicle was not
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:25.880]  deemed too suspicious and officers were stood down. However, according to an employee who works at one
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:30.440]  of the venues that was evacuated, he saw information that suggests the incident was in fact attempted
[01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:35.080]  terrorist attack. The bomb was real. He said adding that the device contains shrapnel and that the
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:40.680]  car was filled with gas canisters. Additionally, the vehicle had no registered owner in no insurance.
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:45.480]  The employee also said, quote, the car was parked in a very high traffic area with busy clubs and
[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:49.800]  pubs all around including a sold out open air event. If it went off, a lot of people wouldn't
[01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:53.480]  have made it home that night. The mainstream media won't report on it. So maybe you will. And for
[01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:57.320]  more news, the mainstream media won't cover out of fear of political correctness. Visit info
[01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:01.880]  wars.com. This is kid Daniels reporting. Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:06.680]  you over a year to do it. Why is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:12.120]  problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:17.880]  toxins from food and water and beverages in my system. But right now we're dealing with massive
[01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:23.240]  parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right
[01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:29.400]  now with all the refugees spreading disease around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:32.760]  These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:37.800]  in there. You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:42.200]  recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year. All right, well, I'm glad we've got some
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:45.800]  back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday. Living defense

[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:20.120]  All right. We're back.
[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:24.120]  Hope's openly announcing world government saying open your borders up. There's no such thing as
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:31.320]  Muslim terror. Psyop is intensified. Former head of the NSA and technical division has come out
[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:34.920]  and said look they got copies all the Hillary's emails and that's a really good point to make.
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:40.600]  And we've got a new story up on info wars.com. Crooked Hillary will try to steal the election
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:45.640]  from Trump. If she stole the primary she's going to steal the general. And again people say well
[01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:49.960]  what do you do about the fraud you have a landslide to counter that. But more importantly you point
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:54.840]  out she stole it from Sanders and make that the ongoing issue to get the Sanders voters.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:05.240]  And I can tell you that people close to Trump as close as you can get know that that is a major
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:10.440]  major major issue and they're actually looking at how you broach it. But you have this whole
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:15.720]  compendium of corruption. So people understand it. They know it. Trump has said he's taken the
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:21.000]  gloves off. We are going to be putting together. This just begins it. Investigative reports with
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:27.720]  all the video clips all the documentation all the numbers that show how they stole it from Sanders
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:31.720]  how they try to steal it from Trump and where all this is going to be going and how they're
[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:39.240]  fixing Google fixing Facebook fixing the Reuters polls top pollsters are even nonpartisan are
[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:46.040]  coming out saying this is total fraud. And people say well still just steal it. No all the experts
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:50.360]  agree it's hard to steal a landslide. And then Trump will be able to challenge that.
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:58.920]  So we have to make the issue that she is crooked and has lied and has stolen things before so
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:04.040]  that when they try it again they don't get away with it. We're affecting the battle space. Now
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:07.320]  those scousings will be with us about 40 minutes in the next hour then I'll cover news the last
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:12.760]  20 minutes that we have coming up after that in the fourth hour. David Knight who always has a great
[01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:17.000]  job and then now he knew tonight 7 o'clock central but I promise to go to more of your calls today
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.840]  so we will. In fact in the last 20-30 minutes of the next hour we'll do that as well. I don't want
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:25.080]  to go to folks that have been holding since the last hour then we'll go to the editor of World
[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:32.040]  Affairs briefs old Scousen to cover the waterfront and give us his informative perspective on things
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:36.440]  that are happening around the world. I just want a laundry list with Joel Scousen today. Everything
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:42.600]  from Zika popping up in Florida, 10 cases, to what's happening with the economy, what's happening
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:48.920]  with Russia, what's happening with the emails, all of this and a lot more today. But right now
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:53.880]  let's go to Christian and Louisiana. Thanks for holding it on the air. Go ahead.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:01.720]  Yes sir. Very glad to be talking to you for some call. A couple years ago during the Ukrainian
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:09.080]  crisis I did a lot of extensive research into Russia because Dad fought communism for all
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:13.000]  of the occurred army and all that but I did a lot of research on the different things.
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:15.960]  We're going to have Joel Scousen's take on that in a minute. Go ahead.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:23.960]  But over the recent thing with the mainstream media arguing like Donald Trump is doing treason
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:28.760]  because he's asking Russia for help with this about the emails and to take their party and
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:34.520]  click with me. There was a treaty signed, it was called the United States of America
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:41.000]  treaty with the Russian Federation over. Define organized crime. A criminal matter.
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:47.080]  It was actually signed by Bill Clinton and it allows the two parties between Russia and America
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:52.600]  to trade informational records, history, documents and everything. Sure, but that's classified.
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:57.000]  That's classified information. Look, the issue is he doesn't have these Russian connections.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.560]  Hillary has been selling out our uranium, our weapons secrets to the Chinese,
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:06.760]  to the Russians and to everybody so it's ridiculous for her to claim that somehow
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:12.520]  Trump works with Putin. Clearly the Russians don't want Hillary in there because she's so hawkish
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:18.040]  and so clearly the Russians have been involved in a lot of this both from my own research
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:22.520]  and sources but I hear you. That's a great point, Christian. There are laws that Russia and the
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:25.480]  United States supposedly are going to work together fighting organized crime. Great point.
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:29.240]  Okay, I'll move quick. I want to go to our guest. Let's go ahead and talk to Peter in
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:34.040]  Michigan. You're on the air. Go ahead. Alex Jones. What's up, man? Hey, brother.
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:39.400]  Hey, man. We love you over here. Thanks. Great stuff. We watch you every night.
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:44.200]  So watch one of your videos last night and you were talking about, you know,
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:48.440]  his emergency alert in the landslide and whatnot. And, you know, I really see that
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:53.560]  landslide happening. You know, if you look at Democrats or Republicans or even independents
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:57.000]  and what's been going on, like in Detroit, they built like some state panic altar.
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:01.560]  You look at in New York, they're trying to build the arches of bail. They're trying to have.
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:06.440]  They're not trying to teach in public school satanism. An afterschool satan club could be
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:11.080]  coming to your kid's elementary school with all the criminal behavior connected to satanism and
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:16.440]  everything. Parents would be insane to let their kids even go to a school that has a satan club.
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:21.400]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And just take it back in a way. You said little boys and little girls taking
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:24.760]  showers together. If you really read that bill, I mean, that's what it's pushing.
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:26.840]  What it is is just weak people looking for power.
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:31.960]  So if you look at like whether you're a Democrat or Republican, people are just,
[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:36.840]  you know, with your show kind of exposing everything and just people kind of waking up,
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:42.760]  like you said, maybe being deprogrammed. I don't see how Trump can't win in a landslide.
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:47.320]  I mean, it's just, you have good and evil almost. It's like,
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:52.200]  well, it's the demographics, though, of the blue states and all the election fraud.
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:57.160]  There's a lot of evidence that seven to 10 percent are closeted.
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:01.640]  And they've got internal polling that shows that. And so they think that's going to swing
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:06.440]  enough of these states. But if they still Florida or something from Trump, where he's
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:12.200]  probably 10 points ahead, he'll lose. So it gets in the electoral process, but that's a really
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:17.080]  good point. Peter, I'll ask that question as well of the editor of world affairs brief.com.
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:20.520]  Joe Scowson get his take on that in a moment. Thank you, Peter. Appreciate you calling.
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:24.440]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michael in Louisiana. You're on the air. Thanks for calling.
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:36.680]  Hey, Alex. Listen, I wanted to bring up a issue. I was reading the other day about how they're
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:42.680]  letting the guy that tried to kill Reagan out of prison, John Hinkley, Jr.
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:49.560]  Yeah. And I was wondering if you think maybe they'll try to use him to try to assassinate Trump
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:53.880]  since they are obviously losing, you know, I thought it was like an omen or a bellwether,
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:58.760]  but I don't like to. I didn't comment on air, but you asked that that for 35 years of him being in
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:05.240]  the mental institution. And of course, his family meeting with the Bushes, according to the Denver
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:10.360]  Post days before, and that whole creepy thing and what was done and the fact that Reagan and,
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:18.040]  uh, of course, Herbert Walker were basically enemies and Reagan, you know, would quote
[01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:22.440]  John Birch Society material and things and talk about the New World Order of Trilateral Commission
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:26.600]  when he was running against Bush. He was forced in 1980, put him on the ticket. I thought that was
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:31.000]  really, really weird and just signifies, Hey, you know, you do something for us, we'll let you out.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:36.360]  He's had a pampered lifestyle reportedly with his own little wing of the of the facility
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:41.640]  for 35 years. And I think the guy should be executed because that will put the fear of
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:45.880]  God of these people that openly are engaged in these type of activities. So yeah, I think it's
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:53.080]  a bellwether. Well, I completely agree. And I'll find the timing just, you know, very suspicious.
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:41:01.320]  And I, I'm afraid for Donald Trump. And I hope that they don't try to take our savior from us.
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:06.440]  Well, I don't want to call him our savior and Donald Trump's got his own issues, but he's anti
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:10.600]  globalist. He isn't out to get the country. He has been against it after him gap for 20 something
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:15.080]  years and they're scared to death of him and the whole power structures against him because
[01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:19.400]  he does sing to his own sheet of music and their entire world government program, the Washington
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:23.800]  Post, the Economist magazine, the financial times of London, the people's daily in China.
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:28.280]  They've all hit the alarm bells and said, world governments in trouble. We've got to get Hillary
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:34.760]  in. So shame on all the Bernie people and anybody else. If you don't vote for Trump, he it is a
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:39.560]  referendum on free and open elections in this country. But even if they steal it from him,
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:45.080]  Hillary's got so much baggage that their program is in trouble. I know we've got unlimited calls
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:50.840]  800-25 at 99231. We'll take some later if folks want to hold. But I'll now want to go to Joel
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:56.840]  Scalzen of World Affairs brief former Marine Corps officer fighter pilot in the Vietnam era. Patriot
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:42:00.840]  comes from a long line of patriots, Cleon Scalzen, the naked communists, the folks back at the
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:07.560]  beginning 60 years ago ringing the alarm bells and being proven right about what we face.
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:12.280]  What we face. I mean, Joseph McCarthy, they've released a lot of the Soviet files.
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:18.440]  And as soon as he said, our government's funding the communists, boom, they removed him. It's okay
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:23.400]  to say there's communists and take American rights to fight it, but not to say it was a program of
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:28.200]  the ultra-rich. Carol quickly later wrote a book admitting it. And that was because people at the
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:32.440]  State Department couldn't understand. We're fascists, we're communists, we're authoritarian.
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:36.680]  What's going on? Who are we? And he explained how it worked to them. They've got always heard
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:42.040]  flavors of authoritarianism that the central banks globally manipulate and play off against each other
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:48.680]  in a dialectic to consolidate control. But now their whole project's in trouble. To the point
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:54.520]  they've got to have the Pope un-cloak himself and come out and just call for stuff that is unbelievable.
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:57.800]  Joel Scalzen, you heard a lot of those questions that the listeners were bringing up.
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:01.960]  There's so many things to tackle. In a few minutes, tell us some of the things you think we
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:05.160]  should go over today and then obviously we'll cover the waterfront. Thanks for joining us.
[01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:10.760]  Well, it's good to be with you, Alex. I, of course, we need to cover the election and Donald
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:17.640]  Trump and how they plan on defeating him. And what Trump is not doing, I think, to help out
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:24.120]  his own cause. That's a serious concern to me. I think we need to talk about the cover-up of
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:29.160]  Hillary, the kind of immunity that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have. We need to talk about
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:34.600]  the Republicans that are switching sides and planning on voting for Hillary Clinton. It's
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:39.800]  interesting to see who they are and what that portends. We also need to talk, I think, about
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:51.960]  the Middle East and where that's going in terms of ISIS and trying to defeat it, which Donald
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:57.080]  Trump says he's going to do, but I don't think he can. Well, let's start with the election.
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:04.360]  Well, the important point, I think, is that I am really not convinced that we're going to have a
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:11.240]  landslide yet. We could very easily have a landslide if Donald Trump would be more careful about
[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:16.360]  what he says. He seems to have a very sore spot about being attacked. When he got attacked by
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:23.960]  Mr. and Mrs. Khan at the Democratic National, he came out in a reactionary way of condemning them.
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:29.080]  Instead of saying, for example, you know, the politically astute thing would have been to say,
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:32.840]  look, Mr. and Mrs. Khan, you are not the kind of people that I would have stopped from coming
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:38.520]  into the country. I did not say stop all Muslims. I said, we stop it until we have a proper vetting
[01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:45.160]  process. And you obviously would have gone through and achieved the proper vetting. I mean,
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:53.160]  he would have gained tons of points. But you cannot come out and attack a set of parents whose
[01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:59.960]  child or whose son was killed in the military. You just can't do that. And it's the same thing
[01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:07.160]  of attacking the Mexican judge. It just wasn't well thought out of. And, you know, with a 60-plus
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:12.760]  point negative rating that Hillary Clinton has and Donald Trump has, the one who is going to win
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:17.320]  this election, the ones who are going to appeal to the 40%, that aren't part of these two solid
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:23.960]  blocks of socialist Democrats turning to Hillary and pro-globalist people turning to Hillary,
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:29.880]  and the anti-establishment people, there's a solid 30% block that's for Donald Trump. But there's a
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:36.360]  massive block of 40%. The Donald Trump's got to get a significant amount of that. They want to believe
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:43.480]  there's someone else other than the establishment. But I just am waiting for Donald Trump to show
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:48.920]  some restraint in terms of what he reacts to when he gets attacked. So I'm concerned about that,
[01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:56.280]  Alex. Now, I really think that they are going to throw the election. Look, when Brent Scowcroft,
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:02.440]  when Richard Armitage, when Henry Paulson, and a half a dozen other big-name globalists,
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:09.240]  Neocons, Bob Kagan come out and endorse Hillary Clinton, these are nominal Republicans. I mean,
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:14.040]  these are Neocons. These are people who aren't true Republicans. So it's no big deal for them to come
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:19.960]  out and say that, except that it is providing kind of a bandwagon effect that other liberal
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:25.640]  Republicans may be swayed or moderate Republicans may be swayed to vote for Hillary Clinton.
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:31.960]  I mean, as I pointed out last election in 2012, when they tried to say, you know, you eliminate,
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:37.720]  you had eight million less people who voted in 2012 than 2008. I just found that incredible,
[01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:43.720]  unbelievable. There was so much more intensity against Barack Obama. And even with Mitt Romney's
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:49.000]  problems, I mean, he was fairly charismatic. He was a good-looking person. He was well-smoken.
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:55.640]  There's just no way that he would have pulled less people than John McCain did, who's, you know,
[01:46:55.640 --> 01:47:02.040]  a turncoat, a Rhino Republican. Nobody trusted John McCain except the middle of the road people. So
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:08.360]  I think that at the federal level, they actually eliminated eight to 10 million votes to reelect
[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:13.080]  Barack Obama. Well, that's right. Mitt Romney was way better and much more popular and more
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:20.040]  charismatic than McCain, who was a total stand-in shill, quizzling. So definitely there is election
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:25.000]  fraud going on. What does Donald Trump do about that? I mean, she stole the nomination. I think he
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:32.200]  makes it all about this. Well, I think you have to look at how the nomination was stolen. The
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:36.280]  technique is different than what they would have to do to steal an election from Donald Trump.
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:42.040]  I mean, for example, they had the super-delegates that loaded the loaded dice against Sanders from
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:47.000]  the very beginning. And there was some actual vote fraud during some of the elections, the five
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:52.040]  major Eastern cities that should have gone to Sanders that went to Hillary Clinton. But, you
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:58.040]  know, it's awfully, and you notice they didn't do exit polling, of course, in in primaries. And so
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:04.040]  it becomes very easy to fudge the actual results. I mean, that's one of the ways that the Brexit
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:09.800]  vote went against them is they had paper ballots instead of electronic voting, and they didn't
[01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:13.720]  have exit polling. So it made it very, very difficult, even though they probably tried.
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:18.040]  Sergio, just to be clear, though, I'm not even talking about trying to block the theft. Let's
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:23.000]  talk about that next. But first, I'm saying make it a big issue that Hillary stole the primary,
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:28.440]  had the delegates come in and ignore the popular vote, and make that the issue. Because that,
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:35.240]  to me, is the biggest naked fraud out there so far. Right. I completely agree, Alex. It's a good
[01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:41.320]  point to make. But when you prepare for, you know, the national election, there will be exit polling.
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:47.080]  And exit polling means that they've got to keep the fudging of the votes within 10% or people say,
[01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:51.640]  wow, something's really wrong when it goes when the exit polling differs from the final results
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:58.120]  by more than 10%. Even when it violates more than 5%, it's really a problem that they have to explain
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:05.720]  away. So as I say, in 2012, they didn't try to do a lot of state rigging of elections, even though,
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:10.920]  you know, you have your machines in New York, in Chicago, in LA, and where they can, you know,
[01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:16.840]  fudge. They do a lot of fudging, of course, in 2012 by the Supreme Court and other courts,
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:21.560]  overruling voter ID laws, making sure that any illegal could get in there and vote.
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:25.560]  And so that probably accounted for several million votes. But boy, I tell you, that wasn't
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:31.320]  enough in 2012, I think they simply eliminated 10 million votes at the national level. And so who
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:36.520]  do you, whose 10 million votes were they from what states? You can't tell because of a state
[01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:41.320]  challenges the federal to remember in 2012. That's the first time that all the votes from
[01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:46.760]  every state was tallied at the national level, not at the state level. And so it made it very easy
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:51.080]  to fudge the result of any state challenged it, they would say, oh, yes, you have exactly what
[01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:55.400]  you would give it to us. And they would, you know, adjust the tally from some other state. It's kind of
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:50:03.240]  like a roving, shifting, hide the the peanut under the walnut shell. They can get away with that at
[01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:07.560]  the national level. And I don't know of any way to stop that really, even paper ballots won't,
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:11.960]  a challenge won't work at a state level. If it's tallied, it's a national level.
[01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:18.520]  Joel, when we come back, I want to ask you what you think they're going to do if Hillary's able
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:23.800]  to steal it and get in versus scenarios if Trump is able to get in because we're only three months
[01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:29.080]  out from this happening. What do you think Obama and the globalists will do in the few months?
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:34.760]  They're still in in December and in part of January while they're still sitting in there.
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:41.880]  I see they've got contingencies with Paul Ryan. It's coming out plans to sabotage things if Trump
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:48.280]  does get in and a lot more with Joel Scowson, editor in chief at worldofheirsbrief.com.

[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:35.160]  say indisputably. A lot of folks say he's about the best there is. But getting back with Joel
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:40.360]  Scowson here, we've got the Washington Post, everybody as I said earlier, with headlines
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:47.240]  like his globalism is in deep trouble. G 20 doubles down. And yeah, all these admissions of
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:51.000]  world government in deep trouble because of nationalism that brings it all of it.
[01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:57.240]  They always wanted to have this world government project in the dark now because of you and many
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:05.320]  others. And Donald Trump. We're having a real debate. I don't see how they can succeed long
[01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:09.640]  term as more and more people understand the Federal Reserve's private as more and more people
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:14.760]  understand the conspiracy, Joel. So in your gut, I mean, what do you see happening if Hillary gets
[01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:19.480]  in versus a Trump just a few minutes we have in the short segment? What's the big picture for
[01:56:19.480 --> 01:56:25.800]  team humanity against a team technocrat? Well, there's a massive uprising against globalism
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:30.920]  worldwide, or especially in Europe and the United States. And Donald Trump has tapped into that
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:37.400]  in a popular sense. He's not really going to, you know, swore that he will not sign the TPP or the
[01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:45.320]  TTIP. He will undo NAFTA, GATT and World Trade Organization and start to do individual treaties
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:52.040]  with individual countries. So this is a real strong position that I don't think he can ever back
[01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:56.520]  down on. So that's one of the reasons why I think the globalists cannot afford to let Donald Trump.
[01:56:56.520 --> 01:57:01.240]  That's the big one, isn't it? That's the big one. That's the big one. I mean, the borders thing is
[01:57:01.240 --> 01:57:07.560]  also a big one because this is a major conflict creation agenda and to water down conservative
[01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:12.040]  voting power in both Europe and the United States if you water down with unlimited immigration.
[01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:20.280]  This is the big thing that Hillary will, in fact, just swamp us. Within 100 days she's going to have
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:26.840]  massive amnesty. She's going to continue everything that, you know, Donald Trump is against and
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:31.720]  including more Muslim refugees that will double or triple coming into the United States. This is
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:36.760]  going to be a massive problem that, as you know, Alex, will never be undone. Once these people get
[01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:42.680]  here, they will never be shipped back. The illegals will never be shipped. Now, I personally do believe
[01:57:42.680 --> 01:57:48.760]  in self-deportation, meaning that if you start to enforce deportation and you strip people of other
[01:57:48.760 --> 01:57:53.560]  things to pay for it and things, there's a massive incentive to get back to Mexico before you get
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:58:00.680]  forcibly deported. And so I think this whole thing about you just can't deport 11 million people
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:07.320]  is just baloney. You can if you start to enforce the law. And I'm not sure that Donald Trump has
[01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:13.800]  the right tactics in that role, but I, you know, clearly Hillary Clinton is the end of the world
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:18.200]  for the conservative movement because, first of all, you're going to flood the country with voters
[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:23.000]  who will vote Democratic. You never win another election again. She'll flood the Supreme Court,
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:29.720]  could be up to three or four replacements during her term. And so you'll never win another Supreme
[01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:35.560]  Court decision again. Those are the two major things, I think. Plus, you know, the war on terror,
[01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:40.280]  it looks like Donald Trump would get suckered into fighting. Stay right there, back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:56.200]  This is the end of the republic. If it happens, it's just unbelievable. We'll be back. Stay with us.

[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:47.320]  the programming of the public to serve their one world government system we're not just being
[02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:54.840]  conquered by some more advanced civilization being conquered by people who are literal servants of
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:01:00.920]  evil and the rest of us are just caught up in the middle of it it is it is an epic time to be alive
[02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:04.680]  phone calls are coming up jones kauss is our guest i want to get into the next segment into russia
[02:01:04.680 --> 02:01:12.120]  the emails and more but jones kauss and world affairs brief you were finishing up with the
[02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:17.160]  fact that what happens if hillary gets in please continue and then briefly what happens if trump
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:24.440]  gets in it doesn't mean some panacea takes place well that's right if trump gets in first of all
[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:29.480]  you know i'm even though i plan on voting for trump i'm very worried about some of his positions
[02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:32.920]  i'm voting for trump because this is the last election that's going to make a difference in
[02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:37.240]  this country in my opinion if hillary gets in it's all over for the and by the way we haven't
[02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:41.480]  talked about your pedigree i mean you used to run the major national conservative movement in dc i
[02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:45.560]  mean i mean you've been a big wig and all that i mean you've been at the highest levels that's
[02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:49.640]  right i was the chairman of the conservative national committee during the reagan administration
[02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:57.640]  and that's when dinesh susan started out he was a young guy coming in from india and got swallowed
[02:01:57.640 --> 02:02:02.760]  up by the establishment he won't touch conspiracy conspiracy he does some good work in terms of
[02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:07.800]  exposing obama and hillary but you know he puts out the message that if we just get rid of these
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:13.240]  two people that were good to go and that's just not true we're dividing a massive conspiracy of
[02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:18.280]  power that controls both political parties and that's what happens if hillary gets back in
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:24.040]  there fully back in control but here's something that they want other than just winning with hillary
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:31.560]  what they want to do is defeat trump soundly they want to embarrass the entire anti-establishment
[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:37.000]  movement so they might steal it by a huge number and just say see you're repudiated they want to
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:43.480]  repudiate it so bad it's just like brexit theresa may is going to sabotage the breakfast so badly
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:48.360]  that people would just forever regret having voted for breakfast and that's what they want to do is
[02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:53.000]  by the way i talked to forage you know on record and off record at dinner with him and he said
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.200]  he seemed pretty freaked out he said we had to do the right thing but they're really trying to
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:03:00.760]  wreck the country now and sabotage i hope folks understand you know that you know that and then
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:05.160]  we don't get into them but they're pulling out all the stops now that's right and they're going to
[02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:10.200]  pull out all the stops to defeat trump big in my opinion because what this does is crush the
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:14.760]  anti-establishment movement and you know paul ryan can come out and mit romney will come and say you
[02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:19.960]  see this is what happens when you guys go off the rails and support somebody like donald trump you
[02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:24.680]  know this is a dead end we're going to lose the whole republican party because of you people
[02:03:24.680 --> 02:03:29.480]  and there's a whole bunch of people who will be susceptible to that and come back to the mainstream
[02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:35.720]  that's what they hope it'll be self-fulfilling prophecy yes exactly and so that's the biggest
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:41.240]  fear that i have how do we counter that then i mean just landslide exit polls get trump out
[02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:48.360]  front saying she stole the nomination well you know you have to counter it by having a leader
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:54.360]  that's got the kind of strength that the trump puts out i mean frankly the you're not going to
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:59.960]  convince the the mainstream of the main body of the 30 percent maybe 20 percent of that
[02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:05.400]  or sorry 80 percent of that 30 percent is going to stay true to the anti-establishment and not going
[02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:10.520]  to ever go back to the other thing but they need a leader they need a ron paul somebody who will
[02:04:10.520 --> 02:04:16.280]  be solid and stable and very carefully spoken that's the danger of donald trump as he's captured
[02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:23.160]  the movement and he said many right things but when you support terror i mean when you support
[02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:30.280]  torture it's just almost unfathomable and other things and the war on isis in the sense of you
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:34.360]  know i think that's him trying to go with the honesty and the brazenness because he knows it's
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:38.520]  already going on i have a problem of that as well but in a sick way it's refreshing that he's just
[02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:45.160]  being honest about it yeah the problem is it works into the support the military at any cost you
[02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:50.200]  know and as i said in this week's world affairs brief the problem of both parties out there praising
[02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:55.880]  and praising the military and police power is that it leads to a neocon agenda it leads to
[02:04:55.880 --> 02:05:00.440]  continued intervention explain it all on the other side what a interesting information which old
[02:05:00.440 --> 02:05:04.600]  scott hillary clinton suggested the grieving families of victims of the baghazi attacker liars
[02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:08.280]  an appearance on fox news sunday while the corporate media obsessed over donald trump's
[02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:12.360]  response to a fallen soldier from a muslim immigrant family clinton's response to pat
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:17.080]  smith over the death of her son and libya was glossed over as reported by steve watson clinton
[02:05:17.080 --> 02:05:21.400]  said quote i don't hold any ill feeling for someone who in that moment may not fully recall
[02:05:21.400 --> 02:05:25.560]  everything that was or wasn't said now that's a bold statement coming from hillary's mouth
[02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:30.120]  considering the fbi revealed she lied numerous times about sending classified information over
[02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:34.680]  her unsecured private email server hillary's suggesting once again that families of the
[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:39.000]  baghazi victims didn't hear her properly when she told them the cause of the attack was an
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:43.240]  anti muslim youtube video that it was not a coordinated pre-planned terror attack but
[02:05:43.240 --> 02:05:47.400]  private emails revealed hillary knows the terrorist attack and additionally the whole story about the
[02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:52.040]  youtube video was a state department fabrication to cover up the department's role in shipping

[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:48.600]  there's a story roger stone just sent over we're gonna post the whole thing and set the hill
[02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:54.520]  putans big trump gamble and it goes into a putan said hillary's a liar she's got trips on their
[02:08:54.520 --> 02:09:00.840]  border uh and they're gonna start leaking more more emails again all these governments have hillary's
[02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:05.160]  emails the bigger question is why would hillary put all this stuff on a server she knows penetrated
[02:09:05.720 --> 02:09:10.120]  what was it a more sophisticated program of like putting this info out was it a drop box where she
[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:14.520]  was getting paid we know she was paid by foreign governments but was it for this or did she just
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:20.440]  not care because these people really are reckless they're on they're on huge power trips let me
[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:26.840]  ask you that question obviously i don't put putin up on some pedestal you don't either uh all these
[02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:35.560]  big power structures are are philip predatory uh groups but what do you make with the situation
[02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:39.800]  where it breaks it and naisal forage and ukip don't want to have war with russia that just seems
[02:09:39.800 --> 02:09:45.560]  like common sense to me uh you've got uh trump not pushing that uh you've got i mean myself i'm
[02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:51.240]  not for that seems like common sense and there's almost a nostalgia uh out there uh where people
[02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:55.720]  hate obama but they like latin or putin i guess for whatever reason because he goes hunting or
[02:09:55.720 --> 02:10:00.280]  whatever or kind of like a john wane character there's been such a demonization of you know male
[02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:09.000]  leader figures what do you make of this whole spectrum of of pieces and who do you think is
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:13.400]  involved in these hacks because i've talked to a lot of folks that are smart and they say no doubt
[02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:16.760]  it's the russians i mean i think that's clear a lot of these hacks are russians but it's other
[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:21.320]  governments that are that are penetrating these as well so what do you make of all this joel scousen
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:27.880]  we have to remember that the whole reason for hillary putting her emails on private servers
[02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:33.480]  was because of her own corruption and her own illegal activities uh selling influence basically
[02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:37.400]  through like the head of the epa had her own numb the plume and and and fakes you know separate
[02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:42.600]  server yeah that's right and it was to cover her so she really didn't care about the national
[02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:47.720]  security aspects of the thing she had to protect her own and that's why she may disappear so many
[02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:53.640]  of those emails and those emails are in the hands of the nsa look they've got everything so they know
[02:10:53.640 --> 02:10:58.280]  exactly what hillary's doing and the reason why the fbi isn't prosecuting the nsa isn't revealing
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:04.920]  that is because i mean uh this is part of the system of immunity the people who play games with
[02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:12.120]  the globalist conspiracy are given protection now putin is has to be kind of careful the reason
[02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:17.160]  why he isn't revealing these things except perhaps through wiki leaks he can pass those on to a
[02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:22.920]  saunge and wiki links is because he doesn't want to let the us and nsa know how much he
[02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:27.880]  what his capabilities are in terms of spying on americans which i think are considerable
[02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:33.800]  but i don't think they're anywhere near what the nsa because remember the nsa has actual physical
[02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:40.360]  taps into email servers from it at and t and verizon and beyond that they've got backdoor
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:45.560]  chips all built in it's it's it's way beyond that that's right and the russians don't have that they
[02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:51.800]  don't have the same access to our infrastructure and to those private companies that our nsa does
[02:11:51.800 --> 02:11:57.160]  and so i don't think that the uh that the uh you know the if the russians have anything
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:12:01.960]  they're trying to tap into government servers so they can see what the government is collecting
[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:05.800]  by tapping into government and that's where they're but the government's very much aware
[02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:10.200]  they're targeting lazy staffers that take the material illegally off those government servers
[02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:15.560]  yeah that's right so i don't think the russian threat in terms of surveillance is a threat threat
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:20.200]  or ability to do cyber things there's anywhere near what our no i agree but what about the
[02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:25.320]  political import what about the relationship what about this situation between putin and and
[02:12:25.320 --> 02:12:30.760]  trump what do you make of that well first of all i don't think there's uh russia uh
[02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:35.800]  trump doesn't have as much influence in russia has he as it has been reported as he has sure he
[02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:41.480]  has some business ties for his and has tried to make inroads into moscow in terms of hotels and
[02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:45.720]  other types of things but just like you know the stories that have come out about his mafia
[02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:51.080]  trump's mafia connections i mean look you can't build a hotel in new york without dealing with
[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:57.960]  mafia controlled labor unions and mafia companies you can't build a casino in atlantic city or
[02:12:58.680 --> 02:13:04.280]  los vegas without dealing with mafia controlled companies and unions so i don't think uh putin
[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:11.320]  um i don't think uh trump has any mafioso type connections in the sense of an evil type of
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:16.360]  thing i think he just made a a pragmatic business decision that i totally agree with you that's
[02:13:16.360 --> 02:13:20.440]  what the evidence shows but but what about what do you think the anglo-american establishment
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:28.200]  thinks of this of what trump thinks of of of russia trying to help bring down hillary clinton
[02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:37.800]  well you know russia has had a great deal of success in fighting the globalist agenda in syria
[02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:41.320]  and sticking it in the face of the globalists and say look we're not going to let you take down
[02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:46.360]  a sod i mean this surprised everyone including myself i didn't see it coming because uh
[02:13:46.360 --> 02:13:52.120]  putin didn't lift a finger to help a sod until all of a sudden he changed modes and decided to do
[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:57.080]  so and and that's why paul craig roberts and other people are applauding putin is because he
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:14:03.960]  seems to be the hero on the white horse that is attacking globalist so this leads us to the bigger
[02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:10.280]  question in terms of the big propaganda out there from the anti-globalist on our side even on the
[02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:15.960]  right like paul craig roberts is that putin is the good guy and the us the globalists are the bad
[02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:20.520]  guys and they're going to start a war with russia and that's what all these troops on the border
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:26.920]  with russia and that's why the troops coming into the Baltics and the big war exercises are all
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:32.600]  meant to to start a war with russia in fact even the russians think that the us is going to provoke
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:38.760]  a war with them sooner rather than later and i think they're wrong my view is that the globalists
[02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:45.560]  are doing very soft provocations i mean the russians know that these few truth thousands of
[02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:50.120]  troops even tens and twenties sure are you saying they're doing it to like scan the defenses in war
[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:57.640]  game not only that they're doing it to help putin build his his rapport with the russian people and
[02:14:57.640 --> 02:15:03.560]  build the image of the us of nato as aggressors now this russia needs this to get the russian people
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:09.720]  on his side to eventually attack the west and so does china and that fits in with hillary is is
[02:15:09.720 --> 02:15:15.000]  actually the one on record wall street journal uh that is actually arming russia and giving them
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:21.000]  the iranium everything that shows that larger high-level globalist agenda that's exactly right i
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:27.000]  mean clinton didn't actually produce this iranium deal this was a globalist deal to help i mean the
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:33.560]  globalists have been trying to help build russian and chinese military technology for years and to
[02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:37.560]  fund them even when the phony followed the so-and-you knew they were sending suitcases full of hundred
[02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:42.120]  dollar bills over to the kremlin and that's why the the new oligarchs of russia only had hundred
[02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:47.000]  dollar bills when they went to europe that's why they could only give hundred dollar bill tips
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:51.800]  they didn't have anything but hundred dollar bills because of the fed helping out the phony
[02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:56.360]  fall of the soviet union so they've been involved in this and so it's so hypocritical but isn't
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:59.880]  there a lot of evidence i mean i know there's stay behind networks and major influence to the west
[02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:03.800]  and the anglo-american establishment penetrating russia clinton's been cutting that off kicking a
[02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:08.680]  lot of those people out the soros groups the state department people the voice of america people i mean
[02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:13.320]  it seems like russia is uh that they keep arresting oligarchs it turns out they're always Rothschild
[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:18.040]  fronts there's been lawsuits over this uh i mean it seems like i understand before
[02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:22.280]  there were stay behind networks and a lot of it was staged in perestroika but it looks like that
[02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:28.440]  kind of got double crossed once once uh yeltsin was gone and in came putin there was a double
[02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:35.080]  cross in other words the uh the oligarchs were the original communist leaders under under the
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:38.840]  table and they were the ones controlling the paulet bureau which were frontman i mean like
[02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:45.080]  gorbachev was the same crew came in in 1917 yeah that's right that's right so the point is putin
[02:16:45.080 --> 02:16:51.720]  staged a coup uh against the old oligarchs and had boros bear zofsky killed and guzinski exiled
[02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:57.480]  to israel and other places so the original oligarchs were running the soviet union behind the scenes
[02:16:57.480 --> 02:17:04.680]  got ousted and putin now has a new backing of oligarchs but let me be clear no single man
[02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:09.880]  runs any of these major conspiracies whether it's china or whether or not they're all penetrating
[02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:14.840]  each other there there's a powerful group behind and even though the old the rothschilds have tried
[02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:20.920]  to make inroads into the banking system most of this was for influence and spying and for facilitating
[02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:26.680]  aid and trade to the soviet union so let's expand on that clearly soros and others are
[02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:33.240]  launching assaults on russia but you're saying that's part of a false battlefront uh to actually
[02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:41.320]  lure them in to a false war paradigm not for the larger uh more advanced technology response attack
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:48.440]  that's right and it's also was to produce all of the oil technology in the oil aid that produced
[02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:53.000]  made russia a major oil produce all that was western oil technology that went into russia
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:58.040]  and soros helped finance that and things and the rothschild banks helped finance some of these
[02:17:58.040 --> 02:18:02.280]  oligarchs but if putin snatched it back from them then that would mean that a lot of this is i mean
[02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:06.760]  all i'm saying the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray i mean they didn't want brexit
[02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:13.400]  they didn't want russia to come into syria i mean i mean quite frankly i mean i'm not here
[02:18:13.400 --> 02:18:17.960]  shooting my horn but i was told 10 years ago by rt people hearing them by the head of rt that
[02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:21.320]  you know that rush actually was aware of the new world order what was going on and then blah blah
[02:18:21.320 --> 02:18:25.480]  blah and latimer putin you know liked what i was doing i'm like that's insane that's crazy
[02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:28.440]  you know then you get told that by people about donald trump a year and a half ago and then you're
[02:18:28.440 --> 02:18:31.560]  sitting there talking to donald trump and i'm just gonna leave it there and you realize wow we do have
[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:35.400]  that influence and i'm gonna skip this network break this is so important not bragging about
[02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:39.720]  info wars but joe we really do reach 28 million people conservatively a week a lot of those are
[02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:43.960]  new people every week but that's about on average what comes through a week uh it's we're growing
[02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:49.320]  exponentially in fact that's an old number 28 million uh it's not that we're even that good
[02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:54.600]  most people just never read you know the the books the research experienced it uh like you and i and
[02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:58.440]  others have done you've been doing this you know a lot longer than i have i mean our version of
[02:18:58.440 --> 02:19:04.600]  reality is a lot closer to than the false one and so it's just crazy to know it comes out the syrian
[02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:09.320]  emails that asad's reading info wars and telling his people this is the truth go with this that's
[02:19:09.320 --> 02:19:14.760]  an ledin telegraph you got putin we got all these guys they put on russian tv that mainstream news
[02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:20.120]  say is like an alex jones version you know and like that's putin's best buddy uh you've got uh i've
[02:19:20.120 --> 02:19:23.880]  had dinner with isle forage they've been huge listeners forever he said most people when he
[02:19:23.880 --> 02:19:28.840]  goes and knocks on the door this is like 15 years ago were were my listeners he said you okay he said
[02:19:28.840 --> 02:19:32.840]  this on air before most people up in england for me to do this and i'm not bragging about what i've
[02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:36.840]  done i've taken all the great research and the work of so many others like your uncle yourself
[02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:40.840]  i've done my own research as well and countless others and with drudge's help and others and
[02:19:40.840 --> 02:19:46.920]  my listeners i'm not selfishly i'm actually the point where normally i can handle being big i can
[02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:52.200]  handle stuff i'm not on a power trip it's getting to really weird levels now where you know i can't
[02:19:52.200 --> 02:19:56.680]  get into it on air but i mean it's getting weird and they've already tried to buy me off before
[02:19:57.560 --> 02:20:01.160]  that didn't work and i just i really feel like i'm in you know i mean i'm really worried i've
[02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:06.920]  been praying a lot uh because man there's no doubt now info wars is the tip of the spear and i'm just
[02:20:06.920 --> 02:20:11.480]  an average guy joel shows you're you're you're a wise person what do you think about what i just said
[02:20:12.280 --> 02:20:19.800]  well i agree in fact we are at an apex of influence right now that probably means that they've got to
[02:20:19.800 --> 02:20:24.360]  do something to break this all down one of those is going to be to destroy brexit the other thing
[02:20:24.360 --> 02:20:30.920]  is going to be to destroy donald trump have a backlash to try to discredit this movement i don't
[02:20:30.920 --> 02:20:35.800]  think it's going to go away and but one thing i realize even though as you say the russians are
[02:20:35.800 --> 02:20:41.080]  listening and they're watching where i don't think they believe me personally that they're being set
[02:20:41.080 --> 02:20:47.640]  up for a trap even if they did alex they it's in their dna they've got to take down the west
[02:20:47.640 --> 02:20:53.960]  they cannot stop this trajectory in other words they have to figure out a way around the trap
[02:20:53.960 --> 02:20:59.880]  they can't stop and not attack and so paul craig roberts is wrong about putin being benign and
[02:20:59.880 --> 02:21:05.080]  that he doesn't ever have to attack the west they will and so but generally in history the russians
[02:21:05.080 --> 02:21:11.640]  don't attack they get attacked no no remember in hitler they were planning attack they had a massive
[02:21:11.640 --> 02:21:15.480]  they weren't that's why hitler launched barbara rosa that that's exactly why they were gonna
[02:21:15.480 --> 02:21:20.280]  attack hitler so it's in their dna they are going to take down the west but it's in a more
[02:21:20.280 --> 02:21:26.680]  sophisticated way they want to strike the military and blackmail the west into into submission in my
[02:21:26.680 --> 02:21:31.400]  opinion they don't want to hit nuclear cities even though china has threatened that when you
[02:21:31.400 --> 02:21:36.120]  say dna though i would say the west has been more expansionist generally in history than the russians
[02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:40.920]  and it's obviously it's a complex history but when you say in the dna i mean really it seems like
[02:21:40.920 --> 02:21:45.080]  the cosmology is we're always getting attacked and picked on and we're not going to put up with it
[02:21:45.080 --> 02:21:48.200]  i mean is i mean is that why you're saying it's in the dna or explain that psychology
[02:21:48.920 --> 02:21:54.120]  no i'm saying it's part of the three predator centers that i've preached for many years russia
[02:21:54.120 --> 02:22:00.440]  china and the anglo-american globalists i think they're all three satanic uh based conspiracies
[02:22:00.440 --> 02:22:06.920]  against man god and liberty and that's what i mean by their dna is they're taking their orders from
[02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:13.400]  a dark spiritual spectrum uh in opposite to god and they cannot stop from attacking the west
[02:22:13.400 --> 02:22:18.200]  then why and i know that's been in the past certainly why is russia promoting pro-family stuff
[02:22:18.200 --> 02:22:23.880]  population increase non-gmo uh be the world provider of organics i mean it looks like
[02:22:23.880 --> 02:22:27.800]  putin's made a hard turn into all this and i was going to say well that's orthodox stuff that's not
[02:22:27.800 --> 02:22:35.000]  really real but uh it's not really real it's a it's a very good propaganda show putin is very
[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:41.240]  very smart he knows how to play this globalist anti-globalist agenda he knows how to play against
[02:22:41.240 --> 02:22:47.240]  the gmo's i mean he knows that monsanto is part of this globalism and and so is the medical
[02:22:47.240 --> 02:22:52.360]  establishment and all that so he's taking the opposite positions but believe me the soviet
[02:22:52.360 --> 02:22:58.120]  union has never ever done anything but promote their own orthodoxy and they will go back to that
[02:22:58.120 --> 02:23:04.280]  mantra if they get power again but they're playing a very careful game now of trying to keep enough
[02:23:04.280 --> 02:23:10.040]  liberty in russia to keep people in favor of putin but still controlling the agenda so i think it's
[02:23:10.040 --> 02:23:16.280]  a carefully propagated uh carefully crafted propaganda to do this uh you know pro-religion
[02:23:16.280 --> 02:23:20.600]  stuff and but you know they just shut down for example the Mormon missionaries and all of the
[02:23:20.600 --> 02:23:25.480]  baptist missionaries and the joe was witnesses in russia made it illegal for them to teach
[02:23:25.480 --> 02:23:30.120]  anything about religion in people's homes well sure you know the argument is that they're
[02:23:30.120 --> 02:23:35.320]  saying they're putting cia spies into those well this has always been the thing missionaries all
[02:23:35.320 --> 02:23:41.880]  have been claimed that they're cia spies and it's just laughable i mean they may be yes men to uh to
[02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:48.840]  government and to fbi and ci but they're not cia spies but you know that that goes around but nevertheless
[02:23:49.640 --> 02:23:54.600]  what i'm saying is is that putin isn't opening up russia for religious freedom he's shutting it
[02:23:54.600 --> 02:24:00.280]  down and that's the mantra that will eventually come back sure all i'm doing is wargaming this i'm
[02:24:00.280 --> 02:24:07.240]  not disagreeing with you my issue is western pressure on the borders is what's causing russia
[02:24:07.240 --> 02:24:12.200]  to get it and i understand you're saying they're doing that so that russia will go into that posture
[02:24:12.200 --> 02:24:16.520]  and the goblins then play the different regions off against each other and have an excuse to go to
[02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:20.600]  that posture with their own people and that's exactly what putin's writing all the way to
[02:24:20.600 --> 02:24:27.640]  rearmament well i know this separately the economy here is falling apart we they say it's a
[02:24:27.640 --> 02:24:32.280]  you know 0.8 growth rate we all know it's it's a negative growth rate they admit you know it's
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:37.240]  the worst recovery in our history the last seven years there's all this economic news coming out
[02:24:37.240 --> 02:24:42.680]  that the economy is really in shambles um what do you make of this what do you think the state of
[02:24:42.680 --> 02:24:48.360]  the world economy really is jul scousen well i think it is the numbers are indisputable they're
[02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:53.480]  going down it doesn't mean they'll ever free fall into collapse i don't believe that collapse ever
[02:24:53.480 --> 02:25:00.680]  comes without war because as long as people can hustle and make a deal in a declining economy
[02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:05.480]  they'll just continue to make deals and people will still become wealthy it's only when they're
[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:10.760]  people cannot go to work there is social unrest it comes from war that you have an economic
[02:25:10.760 --> 02:25:15.480]  collapse now i just you know people have been preaching economic collapse in terms of gerard
[02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:20.520]  salendi in other words since 2012 and it hasn't happened and the reason it hasn't happened is that
[02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:26.600]  you know the the fed can do this moderate inflation keeping it the real rate of inflation below 10
[02:25:26.600 --> 02:25:31.480]  percent and people can't adjust for that sure the economy is so complex even though it's mainly
[02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:37.240]  service and and automation is so powerful that we have the bobbles and symbols of success and
[02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:43.160]  still enough food and so yes we never hit a total collapse unless civil unrest hits and then that
[02:25:43.160 --> 02:25:50.840]  brings in black lives matter is that a beta test of the demographics change for a civil war type
[02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:57.240]  crisis or is it just social engineering to divide and conquer us so we're not politically unified
[02:25:58.520 --> 02:26:02.840]  i think it's social engineering and dividing conquer and to justify more police action you
[02:26:02.840 --> 02:26:08.040]  know this backlash against police was all government induced as well false flag operations
[02:26:08.040 --> 02:26:12.760]  and it was meant to build support for police that were really getting hammered for all of these
[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:18.680]  unjustified uh you know use of force that was and so it's kind of a backlash but i don't see this
[02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:25.480]  ever deteriorating into social unrest to the degree of racial unrest that justifies martial law
[02:26:25.480 --> 02:26:29.400]  because martial law really requires hundreds of thousands of troops to shut down everything you
[02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:33.720]  have roadblocks everywhere and the economy just comes down i agree but they have the new soft
[02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:38.680]  emergency like france and germany where they say now you have no political free speech and we just
[02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:43.000]  come and arrest you this is a soft martial law that's right that's right and that's what happened
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:48.440]  with the patriot that's what 9-11 was all about so that you accept all of this diminution of your
[02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:53.400]  civil rights so i think they're going to keep things together economically even though there
[02:26:53.400 --> 02:26:58.760]  be a slow decline we got a long way to go there's a lot of wealth uh you know residual wealth within
[02:26:58.760 --> 02:27:04.920]  the country that people can live off of even with 20 real and i know you always get to this point
[02:27:04.920 --> 02:27:07.800]  i want to go to break do a few more minutes come back and take calls i'm going to go to
[02:27:07.800 --> 02:27:10.920]  everybody's patiently holding right away after this break here's a few minutes
[02:27:11.720 --> 02:27:17.240]  let's talk about then the time frame what five years out whatever a nuclear war how this plays
[02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:20.360]  out and then if the globalists are successful that they're the dominant group of the predator
[02:27:20.360 --> 02:27:25.320]  centers what they build once that's in place and then once they finally take down say china after
[02:27:25.320 --> 02:27:30.840]  that what do they do once they've got full luciferian control okay we'll talk about that we've got
[02:27:30.840 --> 02:27:38.040]  three minutes to break let's talk about it okay all right so what i'm saying is that this is the smart way to induce
[02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:43.720]  martial law in prison camps and arresting dissidents like you and i is to wait till war comes and then
[02:27:43.720 --> 02:27:48.360]  another mantra of war saying you know we've got a major crisis this is what's going to drive them
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:53.880]  because they know that russian china will attack the military first and try to blackmail the west
[02:27:53.880 --> 02:27:59.720]  into submission that's what saves people from actual total destruction of cities there will be a
[02:27:59.720 --> 02:28:05.880]  preemptive uh emp strike preceding that nuclear strike by a few minutes and that's what's going
[02:28:05.880 --> 02:28:10.280]  to take down the grid and give us social unrest that's good you know even the government will be
[02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:15.640]  out of power for a period of time they've got they even police are not going to come to work when
[02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:21.240]  their families aren't safe so i think when things start to knit back together i think and the reason
[02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:26.040]  they do knit back together i think the u.s has secret weapon systems especially space-based
[02:28:26.040 --> 02:28:32.120]  anti-sat anti-missile systems that can stop any further nuclear attacks while we regroup
[02:28:32.120 --> 02:28:37.160]  under a global militarized new world order and that's the genius of this system if they take down
[02:28:37.160 --> 02:28:41.800]  the u.s military they can come out of the bunkers and say the only way we have to protect us is to
[02:28:41.800 --> 02:28:46.840]  join in a militarized and europe's going to come in and others and that's right they'll all come
[02:28:46.840 --> 02:28:54.760]  together on this and i think that the united states will cut a deal with china to come in
[02:28:54.760 --> 02:28:59.960]  in behalf and switch sides and attack russia's rear and russia will be taken down in this third
[02:28:59.960 --> 02:29:06.520]  world war i don't think the angle american globalist will ever be able to take down china it's too big
[02:29:06.520 --> 02:29:10.680]  it will be strengthened during the war because of more aid and trade just like we strengthened the
[02:29:10.680 --> 02:29:14.920]  soviet union already see those deals being made so what's the pivot about right now to keep china
[02:29:14.920 --> 02:29:22.040]  in line well remember china it's in their dna they're going to attack the west and so that's
[02:29:22.040 --> 02:29:28.840]  why the the mantra is talk a big stick send our ships out there into them to keep international but
[02:29:28.840 --> 02:29:34.200]  don't do anything and continue to invite china into our military exercises so that they can spy on
[02:29:34.200 --> 02:29:41.080]  our on our military that's exactly what they're doing the cno chief of naval operations is totally
[02:29:41.080 --> 02:29:45.720]  permissive about sign of the chief of sink pack fleet is totally permissive about dealing with
[02:29:45.720 --> 02:29:53.400]  china stay right there joe we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on the run alex
[02:29:53.400 --> 02:30:02.680]  jones and the gcn radio network west likely another attempt to downplay islamic terrorism
[02:30:02.680 --> 02:30:06.520]  london authorities covered up an attempted car bombing on saturday night according to a source
[02:30:06.520 --> 02:30:11.560]  who reached out to info wars camden lock a popular area for clubgoers was evacuated by police after
[02:30:11.560 --> 02:30:16.280]  report about a suspicious vehicle attempt to dpm local time as reported by paul joseph watson

[02:30:49.320 --> 02:30:52.840]  people wouldn't have made it home that night the mainstream media won't report on it so maybe you
[02:30:52.840 --> 02:30:56.920]  will and for more news the mainstream media won't cover out of fear of political correctness visit

[02:33:26.920 --> 02:33:35.000]  you know i was sitting around with my shoulder ring of your phone calls here in a moment
[02:33:36.520 --> 02:33:44.360]  and i was uh on a tablet pulling up mit magazine and other publications and i was going online i'm
[02:33:44.360 --> 02:33:49.400]  i'm doing some research sites and showing them cows that have like ports on their side doors
[02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:54.280]  where they just open them up and then go into their uteruses and insert different
[02:33:54.280 --> 02:34:01.000]  type mirror humanoid clones and then and then grow them for harvesting tissue
[02:34:02.360 --> 02:34:05.080]  and i was sitting there thinking why am i telling my kids about this because
[02:34:05.720 --> 02:34:09.080]  they need to know when they see this in popular culture and things that they're being conditioned
[02:34:09.080 --> 02:34:15.160]  for it i mean i remember i was on air like 18 years ago and the bbc had an article admitting
[02:34:15.160 --> 02:34:22.360]  that they had human animal clones but that they didn't have any rights that they weren't growing
[02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:27.400]  them up to full size they were in you know test tubes because they're not an animal so there's no
[02:34:27.400 --> 02:34:31.880]  laws on that and they're not a human see it's all these games and i've been on air 18 years
[02:34:32.440 --> 02:34:36.760]  they've been at 18 years ago it was going on a decade before that and now though it's in popular
[02:34:36.760 --> 02:34:41.160]  culture now they're going oh yeah you can buy glow-in-the-dark cats you know they're $5,000
[02:34:41.160 --> 02:34:46.680]  they're part jellyfish or and i'm really just talking about all this geopolitical news with
[02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:53.320]  jose calzen really at the end of the day you've got a crazy elite playing god who believe they're
[02:34:53.320 --> 02:34:58.360]  going to merge with machines and become god i mean that's the main worldview the religious belief
[02:34:58.360 --> 02:35:03.320]  the cosmology of the people at google and facebook and twitter and all the rest of them
[02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:08.600]  and they really are under a delusion they believe that oh what do we do to this earth
[02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:11.960]  we just use environmentalism to take control we're going to remake it and do whatever we want
[02:35:11.960 --> 02:35:17.560]  we'll have a hundred planets as soon as we become you know the singularity and gods and you know
[02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:23.400]  you're lucky we don't just step on you like you're a bug and i haven't just read this in
[02:35:23.400 --> 02:35:28.280]  magazines when they write this i have i have been invited to parties in hollywood and austin before
[02:35:28.280 --> 02:35:35.320]  and then actually sat there and had these people the head i'm talking like deputy heads heads of
[02:35:35.320 --> 02:35:45.000]  major companies just on fire with what i would call demonic energies people are like like like
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:49.480]  like crazy people but just animated and they're just laughing at me like demons
[02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:54.840]  you're a fool for not joining as blah blah blah and people say why don't you talk about who their
[02:35:54.840 --> 02:35:57.640]  names are well if you're brought to something off record you can't talk about it obviously
[02:35:57.640 --> 02:36:02.680]  as a journalist i'll never be let back in any of these things um but i can't talk about it because
[02:36:02.680 --> 02:36:06.760]  roth cop that one time in front of john harman eight nine years ago the head of the kissinger
[02:36:06.760 --> 02:36:12.120]  group at the time was on the show and going yeah no we came home we know who you are come up to
[02:36:12.120 --> 02:36:15.400]  new york let's hang out your smart guy you're part of the superclass you're the leader of the
[02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:19.400]  conspiracy movement we could do good with you and i said now this isn't off record he goes
[02:36:20.600 --> 02:36:24.520]  well no but it will be when you come up here and harman heard it all folks and it's the one time
[02:36:24.520 --> 02:36:28.280]  i've had one of them do that and it's always the same story we're bringing in world government to
[02:36:28.280 --> 02:36:32.200]  help the poor people we've got to redistribute it's true but you know we can't let all these
[02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:35.720]  advanced technologies out to everybody we'll destroy the planet it's the same story when you
[02:36:35.720 --> 02:36:43.640]  finally say no to them then they shift gears and it used an evil force we're going to go back to
[02:36:43.640 --> 02:36:47.560]  joel scousen here in a moment get his take just on the overarching system then i'm going right to

[02:37:56.920 --> 02:38:02.040]  crazy enough to try to put on a major defense against these people and you know i do ask myself
[02:38:02.040 --> 02:38:06.120]  because this is this is not fun okay at this point this is not fun it's not a power trip it's
[02:38:06.120 --> 02:38:11.480]  actually nauseating at some point but i have to do this even though i'm not stupid i know where
[02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:16.920]  this road goes down the i mean it's it's okay because i will not join with these people let me
[02:38:16.920 --> 02:38:23.400]  explain something if i passively know about this and and and just back off i'm in peril okay and
[02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:30.760]  i'm in peril with the guy upstairs okay so i'm telling you this is spiritual and i've got abc news
[02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:35.400]  saying soon all kids will have microchips they're just throwing it in our face soon we're gonna
[02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:41.640]  forcibly inoculate you blah blah blah i mean it is getting so over the top joel speaking about the
[02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:48.600]  spirit of this world a few minutes on that because you're a smart cookie when it comes to that i don't
[02:38:48.600 --> 02:38:55.320]  see a choice i mean looking at this world system just seeing what it does tuning into this dark
[02:38:55.320 --> 02:39:01.400]  spectrum you talk about is very very nauseating very scary to my soul and so it way outweighs any
[02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:06.360]  fear i have like i really don't even have any fear because it's just so nausea i actually just don't
[02:39:06.360 --> 02:39:09.960]  want to be in the presence of these people anymore and it's not that i'm even some wonderful goody
[02:39:09.960 --> 02:39:15.400]  tissues it's that they're so given over to evil that i can see their works and everything they do
[02:39:15.400 --> 02:39:20.120]  it's just like why can't other people see this why aren't we resisting it why do we have to go down
[02:39:20.120 --> 02:39:26.200]  this road joel well it's because most people don't get that close to it alex so that they
[02:39:26.200 --> 02:39:33.000]  feel that fear they feel that nausea the the the conspiracy and the satanic forces are so good at
[02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:37.400]  putting out believable people in front of you now i'm not saying that hillary clinton is one of those
[02:39:37.400 --> 02:39:42.520]  that's one of her big problems but you know when they seduced the conservatives and the republics of
[02:39:42.520 --> 02:39:48.040]  the george w bush they put out a fairly benign looking guy you know he wasn't too smart but
[02:39:48.040 --> 02:39:52.840]  it really fooled a lot of people for a lot of years and they did the same with dick cheney and
[02:39:52.840 --> 02:40:00.600]  others and so it's it's the i mean look they've paraded root of juliani in front of the the people
[02:40:01.160 --> 02:40:05.640]  of the republican party i mean this is just incredible to have a cross dressing
[02:40:05.640 --> 02:40:12.440]  uh morally incompetent person out there pretending to be the great mayor's mayor and
[02:40:12.440 --> 02:40:18.120]  champion of 9 11 he was one of the conspirators 9 11 and the republican party bought it i mean
[02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:22.920]  this is the kind of thing that we're dealing with is the sophistication of putting in front of us
[02:40:22.920 --> 02:40:30.760]  and then you have your your your idiots like mit romney you know who is a urbane guy who gets
[02:40:30.760 --> 02:40:36.200]  talked into something uh you know he's not a direct conspirator conspirator i agree with you now
[02:40:36.200 --> 02:40:41.240]  because look at how he flip flops against trump now he's for trump i mean he just seems like he
[02:40:41.240 --> 02:40:46.520]  just flip flops around yeah he's not a knowing conspirator you're people like brent sco croft
[02:40:46.520 --> 02:40:52.120]  and richard armative these are real conspirators that put playing the republican side uh but they
[02:40:52.120 --> 02:40:56.920]  like useful idiots like mit romney and other people who they can you know convince people and
[02:40:56.920 --> 02:41:02.200]  they've sabotaged the entire state of utah against trump i mean it's the first time since they voted
[02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:09.240]  for lyndon baines johnson that they might vote for a democrat and uh you know idaho is uh is a
[02:41:09.240 --> 02:41:14.840]  conservative bastion as well but you've got mainstream republican leaders who are talking them
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:20.520]  against trump and so this is the sophistication this is why people don't see it as they put
[02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:28.440]  you know dumb sheep out there in front of us who lead people so what is the end game i mean
[02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:31.240]  because i said earlier we didn't get to it because of the break and we're going to cause
[02:41:31.240 --> 02:41:35.240]  if the anglo-american establishment is the dominant world government predator group
[02:41:35.240 --> 02:41:38.600]  i mean i think that's clear they find more powerful the one the other two combined
[02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:45.160]  i don't think i'm wrong it gets full control what does it end up well then it starts really
[02:41:45.160 --> 02:41:50.360]  clamping down i think after this war uh it started after they start to get together i think
[02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:55.560]  they're going to be a global news citizenship compact they're going to say we're going to
[02:41:55.560 --> 02:41:59.080]  have to be global citizens everyone's going to have to swear allegiance to the no global
[02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:03.960]  government and we need to do this and you won't be able to be a professional you won't be able to
[02:42:03.960 --> 02:42:09.080]  buy or sell i think this is like a mark of the beast unless you're a global citizen and most
[02:42:09.080 --> 02:42:13.160]  people will not see anything wrong with this but they'll say you know there are people who
[02:42:13.160 --> 02:42:17.960]  are working against this great patriotic war there are people who don't support our troops
[02:42:17.960 --> 02:42:22.360]  the people who believe in conspiracy that we the government were responsible for bringing this
[02:42:22.360 --> 02:42:27.800]  nuclear strike upon you we need to lock these people up i think we'll be the jews and the
[02:42:27.800 --> 02:42:33.320]  japanese of world war three elix and i think it happens because of a global citizenship because
[02:42:33.320 --> 02:42:39.080]  of a tightening of the news to say you've all got to get on board we can't tolerate the kind of
[02:42:39.080 --> 02:42:44.520]  dissidents we had during the donald drump fiasco a few years before and i think they'll use that
[02:42:44.520 --> 02:42:50.440]  against people so that's the end game is to tie everyone down into a worse than political
[02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:55.800]  correctness a complete silencing of the sure but joel you're there i'm there matt drudge is there
[02:42:55.800 --> 02:42:59.480]  countless others this but we're covering is the hottest thing out there because it's reality i mean
[02:42:59.480 --> 02:43:05.080]  it's just growing exponentially i mean i think i understand that you know it's it's you know the
[02:43:05.080 --> 02:43:12.920]  elite are powerful and they've got this guidance from the other side but i mean i just i just think
[02:43:12.920 --> 02:43:17.880]  that we can short circuit their program i think there's hope and here's how we do it alex i mean
[02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:25.000]  you can if you can get to trump to establish a team an alternative team to his mainstream people to
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:30.840]  advise him on how to stop i mean i could tell him how to stop isis first of all you can't stop isis
[02:43:30.840 --> 02:43:34.440]  unless you shut down their government black operations but that's very difficult to do when
[02:43:34.440 --> 02:43:40.200]  they control the cia the nsa i mean how do you go in and shut down something where all the leaders
[02:43:40.200 --> 02:43:44.840]  of those agencies are on the dark side you can't shut them down but what you could do
[02:43:44.840 --> 02:43:49.800]  because they don't control the military you could say all right i'm going to give an order as commander
[02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:56.440]  and chief forget trump to do this to say that no militaries to take any more orders from the cia
[02:43:56.440 --> 02:44:02.520]  or the nsa or any other agency or split that back up but the commander chief and we're going to put
[02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:08.280]  that military inside syria with the permission of Assad and we're going to close his border
[02:44:08.280 --> 02:44:15.000]  to any transport coming from turkey or saudi arabia through jordan so that no supplies get to isis
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:20.520]  you're going to starve isis within about a month that's right if that well it's even come out that
[02:44:20.520 --> 02:44:24.520]  hillary was is arming them and involved and we know that and they're letting them back into
[02:44:24.520 --> 02:44:30.680]  britain the jihadis i mean this is so clear yeah but you see if we're going to do something rather
[02:44:30.680 --> 02:44:36.680]  than just broadcast and alert people what it's to get to trump to get some team that can advise
[02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:40.520]  him counter well i mean here's the good thing the bad thing about trump he really is doing
[02:44:40.520 --> 02:44:44.520]  everything himself i mean i i can just tell you and i'm not gonna obviously uh media like a big
[02:44:44.520 --> 02:44:49.160]  deal a lot of it but i mean trump really does just call people and ask their advice on things and do
[02:44:49.160 --> 02:44:54.600]  his own research he does it like 18 hours a day and uh he's really really smart in a lot of ways
[02:44:54.600 --> 02:45:00.360]  but at the same time uh i mean i guess it's good in a way he's super confident and he thinks that
[02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:06.040]  you know knows what he's doing so who am i to say you know i mean i i mean i mean what would you
[02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:09.480]  say i mean let's say i talked to donald trump 15 minutes tomorrow joe scowles and what would i say
[02:45:09.480 --> 02:45:15.720]  to him well the first thing i'd tell him is how you cannot beat isis because of the dark side
[02:45:15.720 --> 02:45:19.160]  of government how they're funding isis and how they're doing it through turkey and saudi ribby
[02:45:19.160 --> 02:45:24.440]  he knows that he's talked about turkey doing it and stuff well i'm not sure he does because he
[02:45:24.440 --> 02:45:30.200]  talks about well um he knows the public is getting sound bites he's given the speeches he knows all
[02:45:30.200 --> 02:45:34.760]  that he knows what hillary's doing he's got military he's got flin telling him everything
[02:45:34.760 --> 02:45:41.000]  he hangs out with flin constantly but flin doesn't know well general flin has come out and said
[02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:49.560]  obama ordered us to basically arm isis well look there isn't any general who isn't a yes man to
[02:45:49.560 --> 02:45:54.600]  the establishment i'd be really surprised if he knew i mean look at all of the information that
[02:45:54.600 --> 02:46:00.200]  uh that gaudy uh got out of the ben gazi hearings about a stand down and yet he wasn't part of his
[02:46:00.200 --> 02:46:06.600]  final report i mean even people who know know that they're afraid to come out and say it openly but
[02:46:06.600 --> 02:46:12.600]  i just don't trust anyone to tell trump the truth unless we get somebody on the inside who can
[02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:17.400]  sit down with him and talk to them about how this world really opposites operates he he is too
[02:46:17.400 --> 02:46:22.120]  confident about saying that i know how the world operates and he does not he may have some general
[02:46:22.120 --> 02:46:28.680]  idea of some things but he needs some detailed information about how this uh government is
[02:46:28.680 --> 02:46:33.640]  is backing isis and that's the only way you can stop it i want to go to calls but just briefly
[02:46:33.640 --> 02:46:39.320]  in 60 seconds this is just stalled how's the world really operate the world operates through
[02:46:39.320 --> 02:46:44.760]  controlling the media through controlling government all three branches controlling judges
[02:46:44.760 --> 02:46:49.400]  they they suborn about 75 percent of congress because of dirt that they have on them of course
[02:46:49.400 --> 02:46:56.200]  they control the executive uh all of the agencies have controlled individuals at the top uh this is
[02:46:56.200 --> 02:47:01.480]  a very very difficult system to beat but you've got to start somewhere and i think you can start
[02:47:01.480 --> 02:47:06.040]  first of all by not doing any globalist trade agreements like trump shutting the border down
[02:47:06.600 --> 02:47:11.800]  and then stopping black operations and that's why they killed jack kennedy they killed him
[02:47:11.800 --> 02:47:17.720]  because he was going to stop cia black operations he was mad as hell after the uh george bundy
[02:47:17.720 --> 02:47:23.320]  shut down the air support for the bay of pigs and that's when he went after the cia and i think
[02:47:23.320 --> 02:47:27.720]  that's why they killed him so this is a tough thing to have but trump is going to need some
[02:47:27.720 --> 02:47:35.960]  insiders of our type on his team if he's going to understand as they present you know what he
[02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:40.600]  should be doing what the counter to that is and if you've got influence with roger stone i would
[02:47:40.600 --> 02:47:44.840]  highly suggest yeah it's beyond that i don't want to get into the whole thing i mean i just you know
[02:47:44.840 --> 02:47:49.480]  i mean our information obviously gets out everywhere and and the thing is it's just i'm in
[02:47:49.480 --> 02:47:52.360]  way over my head i think the whole world is these globalists think they're in control they're the
[02:47:52.360 --> 02:47:58.520]  ones that are really deceived our guest again is the editor of worldoffirstbrief.com joel scousen
[02:47:58.520 --> 02:48:02.440]  really smart guys to head up the big major conservative coalition with reagan of course
[02:48:02.440 --> 02:48:07.320]  of author and of course former marine corps officer fighter pilot and been fighting the
[02:48:07.320 --> 02:48:11.080]  globalist long time i'm alex jones your host for just tuned in i wish we go to he's been holding
[02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:16.200]  the longest here that'd be melton or to be james i guess it'd be melton melton thanks for holding
[02:48:16.200 --> 02:48:23.720]  you're on the air go ahead hey alex good talk to you again it's been a while go ahead a couple
[02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:28.440]  real quick questions uh are real quick statements i wish trump would come out say something about
[02:48:28.440 --> 02:48:33.560]  the kim trails i know he sees them and uh i wish he'd back out at lady that's running against john
[02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:41.320]  mccain and uh lastly uh uh joel this is for you how far how far should we be away from a major city
[02:48:41.320 --> 02:48:49.560]  cases of nuclear strike well the important thing is you've got to be at least five miles from an
[02:48:49.560 --> 02:48:54.760]  actual nuclear target so any major communication or military site you've got to be five miles away
[02:48:54.760 --> 02:48:59.880]  to be free from the blast if you're free from the blast you're free to move but that's one of the
[02:48:59.880 --> 02:49:04.200]  reasons why i put out the world affairs brief because i track what's going to happen with this
[02:49:04.200 --> 02:49:08.280]  war and when it's coming and thing probably more accurately than anyone else so if you have
[02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:13.720]  advanced warning you won't be in a major city because it could be panicky in terms of getting
[02:49:13.720 --> 02:49:19.640]  out so it's not a matter of distance from it's the strategy you take in planning to to at least
[02:49:19.640 --> 02:49:24.520]  watch the signs so that you see when this war is coming when the strike is coming to get out of any
[02:49:24.520 --> 02:49:28.600]  major city you know why are you confident that the russians are going to do is pre-strike
[02:49:28.600 --> 02:49:32.280]  that they aren't going to take out populations and only take out military how do you know
[02:49:32.280 --> 02:49:36.840]  they're going to try to order a capitulation uh by hitting them i mean there's so many weapons
[02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:40.840]  cash there's so many offshore stuff a lot of animals think if there's any exchange to start
[02:49:40.840 --> 02:49:47.720]  it's going to just go total armageddon well you've got to remember that the us cannot respond if you
[02:49:47.720 --> 02:49:53.240]  absorb a nuclear first strike all of our ground base missiles silo are gone and you've got 50% of
[02:49:53.240 --> 02:49:59.640]  your submarines in base at any one time they'll be taken out in a strikes on kingsbay georgia and uh
[02:49:59.640 --> 02:50:04.280]  and bangor washington and so you've got six submarines out there none of their warheads
[02:50:04.280 --> 02:50:11.080]  are big enough to target main things uh main bunkers in russia or china so i just don't think how
[02:50:11.080 --> 02:50:16.760]  you can have a major exchange it's a one-way exchange and a little bit of retaliation if you
[02:50:16.760 --> 02:50:22.440]  absorb a nuclear first strike my theory is though that the russians and and chinese have never been
[02:50:22.440 --> 02:50:28.040]  able to survive without western technology so it's not in their interest to hit cities and destroy
[02:50:28.040 --> 02:50:34.760]  all the technology they want to hit the military first in order to then say look if you don't want
[02:50:34.760 --> 02:50:41.320]  your cities hit then let's make a deal and uh uh that's what i think their theory is but the minute
[02:50:41.320 --> 02:50:45.800]  those cities start getting hit by cruise missiles launched from submarines there's going to be submarines
[02:50:45.800 --> 02:50:51.000]  and weapons smuggled up to the border launched against russia i just i mean if the establishments
[02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:55.000]  really thinking about having a controlled nuclear war they're crazier than i thought they were uh
[02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:59.160]  but certainly see the preparations thank you melton more call straight ahead james and others stay
[02:50:59.160 --> 02:51:04.920]  with us honey i'm really worried about a retirement funds oh me too we lost so much value in the
[02:51:04.920 --> 02:51:09.160]  recession in the stock market i'm worried we won't have enough to retire jim next door told me that
[02:51:09.160 --> 02:51:14.280]  he had set up a new kind of ira with a gold silver group he said how simple and safe it was it's a
[02:51:14.280 --> 02:51:19.800]  private storage ira and we could have real gold and silver in our hands really you mean we can
[02:51:19.800 --> 02:51:24.760]  actually see it and touch it absolutely jim said we could have all the benefits of an ira to help
[02:51:24.760 --> 02:51:29.400]  build a retirement income bottom line we would own a real tangible asset and we would have the
[02:51:29.400 --> 02:51:33.560]  security of knowing we're protected no matter what the economy does what do you think i think
[02:51:33.560 --> 02:51:37.880]  we need to find out how to get our own private storage ira we need to call the gold silver group
[02:51:37.880 --> 02:51:44.200]  right now are you ready to protect your future call 800 421 3432 now to find out how easy and
[02:51:44.200 --> 02:51:49.320]  safe it is to set up a private storage ira with gold silver group and find out how you can qualify
[02:51:49.320 --> 02:51:54.440]  for up to 700 in free silver all transactions are privately delivered and fully insured please

[02:52:02.920 --> 02:52:07.240]  but we're waiting for an outrageously low price you are not going to want to miss this important
[02:52:07.240 --> 02:52:13.160]  message here's why my friends we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse so please
[02:52:13.160 --> 02:52:19.080]  listen solar generators really do provide lifesaving electrical power and unlike gas generators solar
[02:52:19.080 --> 02:52:24.120]  generators run silently emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun whether it's
[02:52:24.120 --> 02:52:29.480]  dangerous summer storms blackouts intensifying civil unrest you're not going to have to suffer
[02:52:29.480 --> 02:52:33.320]  through it like the rest of the sheep and here's the best news if you want to get one this week
[02:52:33.320 --> 02:52:39.160]  solutions from science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators and they're giving away
[02:52:39.160 --> 02:52:44.200]  a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for m4 wars
[02:52:44.200 --> 02:52:49.960]  listeners so it's a good time to check it out go to grid wars dot com that's grid wars dot com
[02:52:49.960 --> 02:52:54.840]  it's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money go to grid wars

[02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:32.200]  said that article that uh kit did very important to see that okay let's take some more calls for
[02:55:32.200 --> 02:55:37.320]  this segment the next day of the night takes over let's talk to uh james in texas you're on the
[02:55:37.320 --> 02:55:42.760]  air with joel scoweson go ahead hey alex long time listener first time caller and a big fan of
[02:55:42.760 --> 02:55:46.680]  joel scoweson as well thank you good strategic location is is definitely something on my mind
[02:55:46.680 --> 02:55:51.560]  right now uh but i just wanted to call in to address one of the the closing comments from
[02:55:51.560 --> 02:55:55.960]  yesterday's show that uh some of your your sources are indicating that russia was the source of the
[02:55:55.960 --> 02:56:01.880]  dnc leaks and i just wanted to put aside russia's intelligence capabilities their their potential
[02:56:01.880 --> 02:56:07.480]  motives and i just wanted to point out that it took the fbi over a year of exhausted investigation
[02:56:07.480 --> 02:56:11.800]  and the conclusion that they could neither confirm nor deny that a foreign breach occurred on
[02:56:11.800 --> 02:56:16.440]  secretary clinton's server and uh i just wanted to ask you if it seems more than a than a little
[02:56:16.440 --> 02:56:21.560]  convenient to you and and a little suspicious that our intelligence agencies are able to to
[02:56:21.560 --> 02:56:27.000]  determine russia's involvement in the dnc leaks nearly instantly now and uh with a high level
[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:31.320]  of certainty well i mean they're lying about how long it took them to get info before on hillary
[02:56:31.320 --> 02:56:36.120]  they were dragging their feet uh i mean it's it's pretty well known that the russians have been
[02:56:36.120 --> 02:56:42.280]  someone promoting uh donald trump but i mean it it might not be to me it's a distraction
[02:56:42.280 --> 02:56:45.880]  the emails show what we already know they haven't denied their authenticity so i think it puts the
[02:56:45.880 --> 02:56:51.960]  car before the horse joel william benny has said that the nsa can track every piece of
[02:56:51.960 --> 02:56:57.000]  code that comes into every server in the united states that means they can track if the russians
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:01.720]  hacked and how they hacked or who it was whether it's anonymous so i think our government is just
[02:57:01.720 --> 02:57:07.000]  playing games with us here they know who who did the hacking and well who do you think i mean just
[02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:13.400]  who stands to gain here joel the communist chinese love hillary that they wouldn't do it
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:21.080]  yeah i just don't think that uh you know the russians uh they do have hackers uh that work
[02:57:21.080 --> 02:57:26.200]  through things but what i'm just saying is is uh i think it's irrelevant who did the hacking she
[02:57:26.200 --> 02:57:33.720]  has been hacked and uh russia is not revealing those unless uh assange comes out and and reveals
[02:57:33.720 --> 02:57:38.600]  he's he's claiming that he has new information that's going to be done look look here's the
[02:57:38.600 --> 02:57:44.440]  russia admitted basically uh they pass it took credit for the climate gain emails well thank god
[02:57:44.440 --> 02:57:49.480]  you know the un working with east anglia to hide the decline and carbon taxes so great russia knows
[02:57:49.480 --> 02:57:53.640]  that carbon taxes aren't shut their economy down it's meant to hurt us too so good i mean i i mean
[02:57:53.640 --> 02:57:57.240]  if russia has evidence that hillary clinton's barbecuing small children hypothetically they
[02:57:57.240 --> 02:58:03.160]  should release it right joel except they don't want to let our government know how much they know
[02:58:03.160 --> 02:58:07.240]  exactly exactly and i'm not saying she's barbecuing children folks it's hypothetical
[02:58:07.240 --> 02:58:11.640]  james in texas great point uh let's talk real fast we're going to break we'll come back and get
[02:58:11.640 --> 02:58:18.280]  your answer after nathan in tennessee go ahead hey there alexa you done buddy good go ahead

[03:00:13.080 --> 03:00:17.320]  there are a lot of good things happening you can just feel the inexorable evil in the world intensifying
[03:00:18.520 --> 03:00:25.080]  and you just ask yourself why why because people running things are committed to a larger plan
[03:00:25.080 --> 03:00:32.040]  and this world has to be destroyed before they think their valhalla can be manifest they are insane
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:36.280]  whether you believe in god or not these people do and they believe in a very evil god
[03:00:36.280 --> 03:00:39.640]  nathan real fast are you saying maybe you want trump to get in and they're like you'd be even
[03:00:39.640 --> 03:00:45.000]  more ron polish what are you saying well what i want to hear is that for the people that don't
[03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:48.920]  really still want one over but you know trump you know that they still don't there's nothing
[03:00:48.920 --> 03:00:52.840]  that's going to vote for healer they're just kind of like and i'm going to go i was a rand paul guy i
[03:00:52.840 --> 03:00:59.080]  don't care i want to hear him say stuff like we won't patriots like edvard snowden like clinton
[03:00:59.080 --> 03:01:03.720]  pardons all these scumbags in the past i want him to pardon a guy like him who in my field
[03:01:03.720 --> 03:01:08.360]  is a political you know i hear you nathan i'm going to jump swing it to everybody i hear you i
[03:01:08.360 --> 03:01:12.440]  think with trump you actually get what's going to happen uh so i disagree with some things but i
[03:01:12.440 --> 03:01:18.040]  mean the guys pretty much just up there and then he's not out to get the country and he actually
[03:01:18.040 --> 03:01:21.960]  thinks that he can be president and you know try to stop him and they just can't believe it the fact
[03:01:21.960 --> 03:01:27.000]  of the system hates him so much legitimately shows how threatened they are by donald trump
[03:01:27.720 --> 03:01:31.400]  organic warrior from california you're on the air with joel scowles and world affairs brief dot com
[03:01:31.400 --> 03:01:39.400]  go ahead joel scowles and awesome guys alex jones anyways i want to kind of touch on the satanic
[03:01:39.400 --> 03:01:46.840]  agenda and the youth um you know i skateboard and surf but i always see like kids wearing pentagrams
[03:01:46.840 --> 03:01:52.200]  and 666 and i really think that they're they're trying to lock in on that yeah they think it's
[03:01:52.200 --> 03:01:57.000]  a symbol of rebellion but what they don't get is yeah sure satan revolted against god but now
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:02:05.000]  satan's in control of the planet real rebellion is not going with the devil correct also people
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:10.600]  need to get off their iphone sixes stop waiting in the line at starbucks and go hold up a hillary
[03:02:10.600 --> 03:02:15.800]  for president sign down here in san diego because i seem to be like i'm the only guy doing it well
[03:02:15.800 --> 03:02:18.680]  great job brother do you have any questions for joel scowles and i said you want to talk about
[03:02:18.680 --> 03:02:25.240]  relocation uh strategic relocation it's a great book i mean man everything at that point i guess
[03:02:25.240 --> 03:02:30.520]  when it happens we just have to be ready you know storeable food non-gmo everything they do is about
[03:02:30.520 --> 03:02:35.400]  making us dependent exactly we need to i mean independent on them we need to be independent
[03:02:35.400 --> 03:02:40.360]  thank you so much uh good to hear from the organic warrior joel you want to comment on what he was
[03:02:40.360 --> 03:02:49.000]  talking about uh the popularity of satanism yeah it's a fad i think you nailed it alex is a bunch
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:53.640]  of rebellion people think this is cool to do something anti-establishment but it's not in
[03:02:53.640 --> 03:02:58.920]  the right direction obviously and very very sad i mean could you be more establishment on this planet
[03:02:58.920 --> 03:03:05.720]  than to be a satanist i mean i mean that's really like yeah that's what how foolish they are alex
[03:03:05.720 --> 03:03:11.240]  they don't realize that they're trying to fight uh what's normal they're buying into what the major
[03:03:11.240 --> 03:03:16.120]  establishment controls joel we're almost out of time we got a bunch of callers but i'm gonna just
[03:03:16.120 --> 03:03:21.400]  get to those after you're gone i appreciate you spending an hour and a half uh with us uh we've
[03:03:21.400 --> 03:03:27.320]  got uh mark cuban coming out in dorses hellary that's just terrible uh we've got a lot of other
[03:03:27.320 --> 03:03:32.120]  points but what what else in the next minute do you want to impart to folks i i want to answer
[03:03:32.120 --> 03:03:37.640]  your major conundrum which you expressed that so many people expressed why would these people
[03:03:37.640 --> 03:03:44.280]  do this absorb a nuclear first strike uh and make us all vulnerable i mean it just seemed inconceivable
[03:03:44.280 --> 03:03:51.640]  but my answer to that is this that you know pdp dd 60 or presidential decision directive 60 which
[03:03:51.640 --> 03:03:57.560]  changed our entire nuclear posture so it proves that they're going to absorb a nuclear first strike
[03:03:57.560 --> 03:04:03.080]  all right so look these people are not dumb these people are not stupid they are not going to absorb
[03:04:03.080 --> 03:04:08.760]  a nuclear first strike unless they have a an answer to that and that answer i believe has to be these
[03:04:08.760 --> 03:04:15.000]  secret weapon systems i believe they can stop any missile systems coming in today any and all well
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:20.120]  sure dr bob bowman when he was the head of star wars before it was even made public uh said that
[03:04:20.120 --> 03:04:23.880]  he said i can only tell you this is accidentally leaked and he said we already had you know robot
[03:04:23.880 --> 03:04:29.400]  drones in orbit with with ddu sabos that would take out the deepest bunkers in 1978
[03:04:30.840 --> 03:04:35.880]  and so i think they're going to stop and while they regroup under the global government that
[03:04:35.880 --> 03:04:39.720]  they're going to push upon us they're going to stop any further missiles from coming in and
[03:04:39.720 --> 03:04:44.600]  that's i think the answer to why there are depending on the fact that they're not going to hit cities
[03:04:44.600 --> 03:04:48.040]  on the first strike i mean why would they you want to hit the military first you want to hit the
[03:04:48.040 --> 03:04:51.720]  missiles first so that you can't no i hear you look i know you're a marine corps officer and
[03:04:51.720 --> 03:04:54.840]  and know the research and i've done the research too i understand this is what they're bringing
[03:04:54.840 --> 03:04:59.160]  us towards thank you so much joel thank you we'll be back with david night
[03:05:00.360 --> 03:05:04.680]  hillary clinton suggested the grieving families of victims of the baghazi attacker liars an
[03:05:04.680 --> 03:05:08.760]  appearance on fox news sunday while the corporate media obsessed over donald trump's response to
[03:05:08.760 --> 03:05:13.160]  a fallen soldier from a muslim immigrant family clinton's response to pat smith over the death
[03:05:13.160 --> 03:05:18.200]  of her son and libya was glossed over as reported by steve watson clinton said quote i don't hold
[03:05:18.200 --> 03:05:22.600]  any ill feeling for someone who in that moment may not fully recall everything that was or wasn't
[03:05:22.600 --> 03:05:27.080]  said now that's a bold statement coming from hillary's mouth considering the fbi revealed she
[03:05:27.080 --> 03:05:31.640]  lied numerous times about sending classified information over her unsecured private email
[03:05:31.640 --> 03:05:36.040]  server hillary's suggesting once again that families of the big ghazi victims didn't hear
[03:05:36.040 --> 03:05:40.440]  her properly when she told them the cause of the attack was an anti muslim youtube video
[03:05:40.440 --> 03:05:44.680]  that it was not a coordinated pre-planned terror attack but private emails revealed hillary knows
[03:05:44.680 --> 03:05:48.920]  the terrorist attack and additionally the whole story about the youtube video was a state department
[03:05:48.920 --> 03:05:53.720]  fabrication to cover up the department's role in shipping living weapons to jihadists in syria

[03:08:25.320 --> 03:08:30.360]  monday august the first 2016 august is already here and of course next week we're going to have the
[03:08:30.920 --> 03:08:36.680]  primary with paul ryanow people who are in wisconsin really need to pay attention to this because
[03:08:36.680 --> 03:08:42.920]  you know what if donald trump wins his biggest opposition and congress is going to be paul ryan
[03:08:42.920 --> 03:08:46.920]  they need to understand what's going on here and there's a couple of stories that are up on the
[03:08:46.920 --> 03:08:52.440]  drudge report talking about that but i want to give you some perspective from the dnc that we
[03:08:52.440 --> 03:08:59.560]  covered last week i'm going to talk about the i would say the con job that was done by this muslim
[03:08:59.560 --> 03:09:02.920]  brotherhood guy that everybody's been talking about all weekend we're going to give you the
[03:09:02.920 --> 03:09:08.200]  background and some of these speakers that spoke at the democrat convention especially the last day
[03:09:08.200 --> 03:09:13.800]  day uh the muslim father of the soldier who was killed also the general who got up you know there's
[03:09:13.800 --> 03:09:21.720]  a story on reason magazine saying that uh alan gave the scariest speech from both the rnc and
[03:09:21.720 --> 03:09:28.440]  the dnc they said john alan had unrestrained warmongering i would say you know we we could say
[03:09:28.440 --> 03:09:35.480]  it's not just that he got up and said i'm with her he also said i'm with war everywhere at all
[03:09:35.480 --> 03:09:40.200]  times and we're going to tell you a little bit about him did you remember that he was involved
[03:09:40.200 --> 03:09:46.440]  in the patria scandal that he was selected to be the head of nato but he abruptly resigned so we're
[03:09:46.440 --> 03:09:49.960]  going to revisit all that for you we're going to do a flashback about that we're going to give you
[03:09:49.960 --> 03:09:56.280]  some background on this muslim father that was speaking there and i want to give you some uh
[03:09:57.160 --> 03:10:02.680]  just kind of my feelings as to what happened uh the week that i spent at the arkham asylum
[03:10:02.680 --> 03:10:07.800]  this last week otherwise known as the dnc but uh first let's take a look at this story from
[03:10:07.800 --> 03:10:13.000]  michael failing this up on info wars dot com just breaking there's going to be a clinton fundraiser
[03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:20.120]  set for the black hat conference coming up in las vegas how about that i guess they want to raise
[03:10:20.120 --> 03:10:26.200]  money for illery clinton how's that for irony or hypocrisy take your pick either way i guess the
[03:10:26.200 --> 03:10:32.680]  way these black hat hackers look at this is that a clinton presidency would be a hackers
[03:10:32.680 --> 03:10:38.040]  paradise it would literally be i guess i would really raise their stock because everybody would
[03:10:38.040 --> 03:10:42.280]  be saying how do we stop all these leaks uh information is coming out of everywhere we
[03:10:42.280 --> 03:10:46.520]  don't know how to stop this well you know you can stop it first of all by not putting all your
[03:10:46.520 --> 03:10:53.240]  classified emails on a private unsecured server there's some very easy things that you can do
[03:10:53.240 --> 03:10:58.120]  to keep from having your information compromised but of course the people that i talked to at the
[03:10:58.120 --> 03:11:04.600]  dnc just really didn't care about that they were far more interested in putting out conspiracy
[03:11:04.600 --> 03:11:10.600]  theories about uh putin and trump but let's take a look at this article from michael fail and they
[03:11:10.600 --> 03:11:15.640]  say according to a cyber security journalist steve reagan the fundraiser will begin this on
[03:11:15.640 --> 03:11:21.720]  wednesday during the evening hours of black hat conference in vegas uh they described this as
[03:11:21.720 --> 03:11:27.800]  focusing on policy issues that will be facing the next administration you can bet that hacking
[03:11:27.800 --> 03:11:32.920]  is going to be a policy issue that is going to face the clinton administration throughout uh
[03:11:33.480 --> 03:11:38.280]  it's rain here they say a black hat spokesman said that the fundraiser was vendor and politically
[03:11:38.280 --> 03:11:43.720]  neutral yeah right and it's being run completely independent of the conference and i say but you
[03:11:43.720 --> 03:11:47.560]  wouldn't know that from being the fundraiser's announcement said reagan he said while black
[03:11:47.560 --> 03:11:51.800]  hat called the event unofficial and clinton herself is not going to be there the idea
[03:11:51.800 --> 03:11:56.360]  of a presidential fundraiser at a hacker conference of any type just feel strange
[03:11:57.160 --> 03:12:02.920]  unless you're talking about hillary clinton he goes on to add that there are no fundraisers
[03:12:02.920 --> 03:12:09.000]  being done at the hacking conference for donald trump okay now who is behind this that's been
[03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:14.040]  the big conspiracy theory because they don't want to talk about what's really happening here they
[03:12:14.040 --> 03:12:19.000]  don't want to talk about the information that's been revealed they want to uh do a very clever pivot
[03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:25.480]  they're much more clever the way that they handle uh bad news than donald trump has been i mean donald
[03:12:25.480 --> 03:12:31.400]  trump stepped in it with this muslim just like he did with the uh la raza judge never pointing out
[03:12:31.960 --> 03:12:38.680]  that he was part of la raza la raza everything for the race for those outside of the race
[03:12:38.680 --> 03:12:45.240]  nothing that's their logo folks this is an hispanic group that is called the race and yet
[03:12:46.200 --> 03:12:50.760]  what he did was he said well because of his mexican heritage i don't think i'm going to
[03:12:50.760 --> 03:12:55.560]  get a fair trial no he's not going to get a fair trial because this guy is a muslim kkk
[03:12:56.600 --> 03:13:00.440]  that's what he needed to point out and you need to point out the same thing about con but he
[03:13:00.440 --> 03:13:05.240]  doesn't instead when you look at the way the democrats handle this kind of stuff the democrats
[03:13:05.240 --> 03:13:11.000]  come out and say well emails what emails there's nothing to see here move along just ignore it
[03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:16.040]  pretend it never existed and lie about it there's a very interesting revelation from
[03:13:16.040 --> 03:13:22.120]  wiliam benney you know i said last week that i believed that if you really wanted to uh know
[03:13:22.120 --> 03:13:28.440]  who was behind this you really had to think about uh take a look at u.s intelligence i think they have
[03:13:28.440 --> 03:13:34.680]  as much if not far more motivation to expose hillary clinton as a criminal as someone who
[03:13:34.680 --> 03:13:42.360]  cannot be trusted then do the russians i think that all of this talk about um as i said when i
[03:13:42.360 --> 03:13:47.080]  talked to alex from the convention you know they've got the other r word that they've been using
[03:13:47.080 --> 03:13:50.760]  they have racist and now they come out with russian they want to attack donald trump because
[03:13:50.760 --> 03:13:58.680]  he's been america first and they want to use this kind of macartheism and it truly is a red
[03:13:58.680 --> 03:14:05.240]  herring okay it is red baiting red herring is what they're trying to do i saw carl bernstein
[03:14:05.240 --> 03:14:09.400]  on the floor of the democrat convention i wanted to talk to me wouldn't talk to me did the same
[03:14:09.400 --> 03:14:18.120]  thing that turd blossom carl rove did with alex i'm owned by uh cnn is what he said but i would
[03:14:18.120 --> 03:14:23.320]  have asked him you know carl bernstein the guy that was part of the watergate exposure i would
[03:14:23.320 --> 03:14:27.560]  have said you know you look like somebody that appreciate a good leak what do you think about
[03:14:27.560 --> 03:14:33.720]  this this latest thing here remember when you go back and look at watergate the deep throat was
[03:14:34.600 --> 03:14:40.040]  fbi okay i think was the guy i think he was a number was a number two i think the fbi that
[03:14:40.040 --> 03:14:43.560]  eventually it came out nobody at the time interestingly enough even though we're the
[03:14:43.560 --> 03:14:49.400]  height of the cold war during watergate nobody suggested that the russians were trying to do
[03:14:49.400 --> 03:14:54.840]  a coup against richard nixon but there were connections with the cia with the fbi with
[03:14:54.840 --> 03:14:59.800]  the people at the very top you have to understand as william benney pointed out there are a lot of
[03:14:59.800 --> 03:15:05.720]  people who take their job seriously as william benney did in the security business that are
[03:15:05.720 --> 03:15:11.160]  absolutely furious and appalled and cannot believe what hillary clinton did and that
[03:15:11.160 --> 03:15:16.440]  she's getting away with us i talked to a friend of mine is retired colonel they said if he and
[03:15:16.440 --> 03:15:21.320]  his wife was also a very high-ranking military official said if we'd done that we'd have been
[03:15:21.320 --> 03:15:26.040]  in jail for the rest of our lives all these people understand that they've seen this happen they've
[03:15:26.040 --> 03:15:31.640]  seen them go after whistleblowers that they came out at the same time talking about how the government
[03:15:31.640 --> 03:15:37.720]  after 9 11 was using dragnet surveillance and violation of the constitution see people like
[03:15:37.720 --> 03:15:43.960]  william benney and thomas drake take the constitution very seriously and unlike conne they absolutely
[03:15:43.960 --> 03:15:49.000]  they understand what's in it they understand what the fourth amendment is about there is no
[03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:54.200]  right of immigration for muslims into this country and the constitution there is no right for that
[03:15:54.200 --> 03:15:59.880]  but there is a right to be left alone and these people who take their job very seriously who
[03:15:59.880 --> 03:16:05.480]  believe that there are secrets that need to be protected for our security and who understand
[03:16:05.480 --> 03:16:10.680]  the penalties that they face and then understand that when they expose criminal actions by the
[03:16:10.680 --> 03:16:16.440]  government that they try to put them away as they did thomas drake for 35 years four documents
[03:16:16.440 --> 03:16:20.360]  none of which were classified some of them they class one of them they classified that same day
[03:16:20.360 --> 03:16:24.200]  then declassified it three months later there was nothing at all to be classified by these
[03:16:24.200 --> 03:16:27.240]  one of them said well it wasn't classified but it should have been and you should have
[03:16:27.240 --> 03:16:30.840]  known it so we're going to charge you for having a classified document it was simply a schedule of
[03:16:30.840 --> 03:16:36.680]  the past project it didn't have any information on it the project was already over so what did
[03:16:36.680 --> 03:16:43.160]  william benney say we've had william benney on our show several times a true patriot a true
[03:16:43.160 --> 03:16:47.640]  constitutionalist somebody who has served his country in the intelligence industry who has served us
[03:16:48.200 --> 03:16:53.400]  as trying to protect the constitution as a whistleblower this is what he said he said speaking
[03:16:53.400 --> 03:16:57.640]  as an analyst this is a Breitbart story benney raised the possibility that the hack of the
[03:16:57.640 --> 03:17:03.880]  democrat national committee's server was done not by russia but by disgruntled us intelligence
[03:17:03.880 --> 03:17:10.200]  worker concerned about clinton's compromise of national security secrets via her personal email
[03:17:10.200 --> 03:17:16.600]  use he referenced testimony before the senate judiciary committee in march 2011 by then fbi
[03:17:16.600 --> 03:17:21.960]  director robert muhler in which muhler spoke of the fbi's ability to access various secretive
[03:17:21.960 --> 03:17:28.840]  databases to quote track down known and suspected terrorists okay he said now what muhler is talking
[03:17:28.840 --> 03:17:34.920]  about is going into the nsa database which is shown of course in the snowden material released
[03:17:34.920 --> 03:17:43.400]  which shows a direct access into the nsa database by the fbi and the cia which there is no oversight
[03:17:43.400 --> 03:17:47.720]  of by the way so that's one of the things that benney is concerned about the fact that the fbi
[03:17:47.720 --> 03:17:54.680]  and the cia can access this information in the nsa database he said so that means that the nsa
[03:17:54.680 --> 03:18:00.040]  and a number of agencies in the u.s. government also have those emails so if the fbi really wanted
[03:18:00.040 --> 03:18:07.160]  them they can go into that database and they can get them right now okay you know those
[03:18:07.800 --> 03:18:12.680]  30 000 emails that hillary clinton's lawyers had the privilege you want to talk about white
[03:18:12.680 --> 03:18:18.040]  privilege hillary clinton let's talk about your political privilege that's what's really dangerous
[03:18:18.920 --> 03:18:25.560]  you have the political privilege that when you are suspected of violating uh the highest levels
[03:18:25.560 --> 03:18:30.360]  of national security your lawyers are first allowed to go through and scrub what they don't
[03:18:30.360 --> 03:18:36.600]  want the fbi to see from your laptop now benny is saying that they do have access to those emails
[03:18:36.600 --> 03:18:41.640]  so then he was asked point blank and this was on erin kline investigated radio he was asked
[03:18:41.640 --> 03:18:47.960]  point blank by erin kline he said uh do you believe the nsa has copies of all of clinton's emails
[03:18:47.960 --> 03:18:54.360]  and benny said yes that would be my point they have them all and the fbi can get them right there
[03:18:54.360 --> 03:19:02.120]  now let me remind you that william benny wasn't just an nsa employee he wasn't just a high ranking
[03:19:02.120 --> 03:19:09.720]  nsa employee he was the head of nsa technical capabilities and had been for quite some time
[03:19:09.720 --> 03:19:13.880]  he knows what he's talking about when he talks about the hack and he also understands the
[03:19:13.880 --> 03:19:21.560]  frustration of people who take this stuff seriously unlike hillary clinton he also knows
[03:19:21.560 --> 03:19:29.800]  the history behind uh john deutch who was uh bill clinton's head of cia he had unclassified or
[03:19:29.800 --> 03:19:35.800]  classified documents on his unsecured laptop they took that laptop he didn't get a chance to
[03:19:35.800 --> 03:19:40.920]  selectively delete stuff he was facing jail time until clinton pardoned him and he lost his
[03:19:40.920 --> 03:19:46.120]  security clearance not so for hillary clinton well i think there's a lot of people in the
[03:19:46.120 --> 03:19:49.960]  u.s. government who are going to make sure that she does lose her security clearance because they're
[03:19:49.960 --> 03:19:54.200]  going to make sure she doesn't become president of the united states stay with us we'll be right

[03:24:13.800 --> 03:24:19.160]  to go back and look at some of the other odd things that happened at the democrat convention of
[03:24:19.160 --> 03:24:26.440]  course we have the con job done by the muslim brotherhood member with connections and that
[03:24:26.440 --> 03:24:31.560]  was the guy who criticized donald trump and of course everybody's been talking about that
[03:24:31.560 --> 03:24:35.400]  all weekend not really talking about the sleeper of a speech that hillary clinton gave you know
[03:24:35.400 --> 03:24:42.360]  you see those pictures of bill clinton dozing off and kane trying to distract attention from
[03:24:42.360 --> 03:24:46.440]  that as well as i get in front of him you know my comment on that on twitter was uh
[03:24:46.440 --> 03:24:52.120]  i'm surprised that he's the only one that fell asleep in that group i can't believe that anybody
[03:24:52.120 --> 03:24:55.800]  could stay awake through that speech so nobody's really talking about hillary clinton's speech
[03:24:55.800 --> 03:25:00.600]  she made sure that she wasn't going to be upstage by anybody in the democrat party they had all the
[03:25:00.600 --> 03:25:08.040]  big hitters speaking the night before that night they just had a lot of various identity politics
[03:25:08.040 --> 03:25:15.400]  and activist candidate speaking or spokesman speaking but they did change their lineup and
[03:25:15.400 --> 03:25:21.080]  we're going to talk about that a bit you know what they did in terms of a tribute to the police that
[03:25:21.080 --> 03:25:26.600]  was something that was not planned until the last minute just like all these american flags that
[03:25:26.600 --> 03:25:31.320]  suddenly appeared on to see after they were criticized for not having them on monday we'll
[03:25:31.320 --> 03:25:35.160]  get to that in just a moment before we get back to the news i just want to remind you that we have
[03:25:35.160 --> 03:25:41.800]  extended some of the specials from our sleeping giant mega sales that happened last week the 28
[03:25:41.800 --> 03:25:46.760]  hour broadcast that we had we had to pull most of those specials but we do still have three
[03:25:46.760 --> 03:25:54.680]  major products from the mega special pricing 40 off a brain force 30 off vitamin mineral

[03:26:26.200 --> 03:26:30.280]  these live events it's very important that we get there that we see these people firsthand
[03:26:30.280 --> 03:26:35.560]  that we talk to them interview the people who are protesting on the street as well as being able
[03:26:35.560 --> 03:26:39.720]  to get access to some of the people like jesse jackson we'll play that for you in just a moment
[03:26:39.720 --> 03:26:46.520]  and tell you how that fits in with the modified at the last minute modified speaker lineup at the
[03:26:46.520 --> 03:26:52.280]  dnc before we get to that i just want to finish up with one other thing that william benney said
[03:26:52.280 --> 03:26:57.640]  you know we've got this article where he says that he believes that it could very well be somebody
[03:26:57.640 --> 03:27:03.640]  inside the us intelligence community that is leaking all this information about hillary clinton
[03:27:03.640 --> 03:27:09.560]  because they're unhappy that she compromised national security that she's not only getting away
[03:27:09.560 --> 03:27:14.840]  with it but she's going to retain her security clearance and become president okay they don't
[03:27:14.840 --> 03:27:18.920]  want to see that happen he says there's another point that he brought up in this interview
[03:27:18.920 --> 03:27:23.400]  with erin kline he said the other point is that hillary according to an article published by
[03:27:23.400 --> 03:27:29.640]  the observer in march of this year has a problem with the nsa because she compromised gamma material
[03:27:30.520 --> 03:27:34.760]  he says that's the most sensitive material at the nsa so there was a number of nsa officials
[03:27:34.760 --> 03:27:39.000]  that were complaining to the press or to the people who wrote in that article that she
[03:27:39.000 --> 03:27:44.520]  compromised gamma material she lifted the material that was in her emails directly out of gamma
[03:27:44.520 --> 03:27:51.640]  reporting so what is gamma okay remember when we talked about how a lot of these emails are born
[03:27:51.640 --> 03:27:58.040]  classified because they're about discussions between top foreign leaders as well as you know
[03:27:58.040 --> 03:28:03.160]  between information that they intercepted between other foreign leaders or information
[03:28:03.160 --> 03:28:10.440]  about what she said to foreign leaders that is born classified so when you send that when that
[03:28:10.440 --> 03:28:14.520]  happens when you're having classified discussions with a foreign government and then you're making
[03:28:14.520 --> 03:28:20.680]  comments about that you don't need to wait until somebody puts a classification sticker on that
[03:28:20.680 --> 03:28:26.360]  it's already classified she should know that she shouldn't have that on her private unsecured
[03:28:26.360 --> 03:28:29.960]  server and they point out that the gamma compartment you know we're talking about
[03:28:29.960 --> 03:28:36.200]  compartmentalization so there's this one compartment called gamma it's an nsa handling caveat applied
[03:28:36.200 --> 03:28:42.120]  to extraordinarily sensitive information for example decrypted conversations between top foreign
[03:28:42.120 --> 03:28:49.000]  leadership that's the kind of stuff hillary clinton exposed okay it's not just that she sent
[03:28:49.000 --> 03:28:55.320]  and received classified emails as the fbi director said and then gave her a pass on the criminal
[03:28:55.320 --> 03:29:01.160]  actions no she also exposed that kind of information so there's a lot of people i think
[03:29:01.160 --> 03:29:09.560]  in the american government who would like to see her exposed and yet all they do is talk about
[03:29:09.560 --> 03:29:14.600]  the russians the russians with trump the russians this the russians that look nobody is talking
[03:29:14.600 --> 03:29:19.400]  about in the mainstream press are they the connections between her campaign manager
[03:29:19.400 --> 03:29:25.480]  john pedesta and the russians okay a putin connected russian government fund gave him
[03:29:25.480 --> 03:29:31.480]  35 million dollars okay she's gotten 20 percent of her funding from the saudis they brag
[03:29:32.280 --> 03:29:37.480]  this is the candidate uh this is exposed in a great report from russia with money
[03:29:37.480 --> 03:29:46.200]  hillary clinton and the russian reset cronyism stay with us we'll be right back
[03:29:49.080 --> 03:29:55.800]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:59.880 --> 03:30:03.800]  but what's likely another attempt to downplay this lomax terrorism london authorities covered
[03:30:03.800 --> 03:30:07.480]  up an attempted car bombing on saturday night according to a source who reached out to info

[03:33:23.720 --> 03:33:26.520]  welcome back to the alex joneshaw and david night this fourth hour
[03:33:26.520 --> 03:33:31.560]  i take a look at some of the other things that happened at the dnc as we were there reporting
[03:33:31.560 --> 03:33:38.680]  it live the la times talks about how vice presidential candidate tem can can speak in
[03:33:38.680 --> 03:33:45.240]  spanish and they asked the question do latino voters care and they point out that he got up and
[03:33:45.240 --> 03:33:51.960]  said in spanish inflected with the tones of the american midwest he spoke to the assembly there and
[03:33:51.960 --> 03:33:57.640]  they say his spanish has been sold as a draw to latino voters an election year in which the other
[03:33:57.640 --> 03:34:04.520]  major parties nominee donald trump said a fellow candidate speaks mexican you know what tem can
[03:34:04.520 --> 03:34:10.200]  speaks globalism uh i remarked about that went on twitter and somebody came back to me and said
[03:34:10.200 --> 03:34:14.280]  well you know this is happens to be a language that 37 million people in america speak you know
[03:34:14.280 --> 03:34:20.760]  that's still a small minority overall but uh i came back to him and i said well just press
[03:34:20.760 --> 03:34:27.800]  trump for english press cain for globalist okay that's what we have globalist and goldman sacks
[03:34:27.800 --> 03:34:33.320]  that's what he really speaks that's his real language folks and i think it's interesting
[03:34:33.320 --> 03:34:38.360]  in this la times article where they say does anybody really care that he speaks spanish they
[03:34:38.360 --> 03:34:44.680]  quote a democrat political strategist felix sanchez co-founder of the national hispanic
[03:34:44.680 --> 03:34:51.080]  foundation for the arts he said canes speaking spanish is simply unnecessary says it's a political
[03:34:51.080 --> 03:34:57.960]  trope that has run its course i prefer to have candidates address issues supply solutions and
[03:34:57.960 --> 03:35:04.920]  then see if they can get it done instead of scripted spanish pablum see that's precisely it
[03:35:05.560 --> 03:35:12.120]  it's all symbolism it's all tribalism there are no solutions being added because what this guy is
[03:35:12.120 --> 03:35:19.160]  offering is globalism okay that's what he's truly speaking hillary clinton doubled down on her choice
[03:35:19.160 --> 03:35:25.000]  with cain uh instead of trying to offer an olive branch to the bernie sanders supporter she doubled
[03:35:25.000 --> 03:35:30.440]  down on somebody that is opposed to everything they stand for which is tpp that was what we saw
[03:35:31.080 --> 03:35:35.720]  in the convention at the beginning uh monday night especially tuesday night all these people
[03:35:35.720 --> 03:35:39.000]  handwritten signs that they had folded up and carried in so they could get them and most of
[03:35:39.000 --> 03:35:44.680]  the people had pre printed signs they were told okay when this speaker comes out you hold up the
[03:35:44.680 --> 03:35:49.720]  sign when that speaker comes out here's the sign you're all going to hold up i mean what a phony
[03:35:49.720 --> 03:35:54.760]  scripted bunch of nonsense but some of them brought in their own signs about what they
[03:35:55.560 --> 03:36:01.240]  were concerned about and it was always tpp with a circle and a slash run through it no tpp
[03:36:02.200 --> 03:36:08.120]  and yet what she did was she picked somebody who is the wall street candidate when it comes to
[03:36:08.120 --> 03:36:12.760]  globalism when it comes to multinational corporations the wall street general was
[03:36:12.760 --> 03:36:17.720]  talking about how excited all of these people in wall street were about tim cain they were all
[03:36:17.720 --> 03:36:24.040]  headed to the convention to celebrate and to buy influence i'm sure but you know the real issue
[03:36:24.040 --> 03:36:29.000]  here and i think it's interesting too when they they point out uh they say well if the argument
[03:36:29.000 --> 03:36:35.160]  is that cain is her choice for vp because he spoke better spanish than castro and perez well that
[03:36:35.160 --> 03:36:41.080]  certainly is a red herring argument isn't it interesting that julian castro who's the head
[03:36:41.080 --> 03:36:47.240]  secretary former mayor of san antonio who's floated as her uh as a leading vp choice uh
[03:36:47.240 --> 03:36:54.360]  he started taking spanish lessons so he could speak better spanish because of the pandering again
[03:36:54.360 --> 03:36:59.400]  you know you all you have to do is speak fluent globalism and i thought it was interesting that
[03:36:59.400 --> 03:37:06.200]  castro whose mother was one of the founders of la raza didn't speak uh that fluent spanish
[03:37:06.200 --> 03:37:11.720]  but look you have to understand why they are pushing this out and you also have to understand
[03:37:11.720 --> 03:37:17.320]  before i move on to what happened in north carolina with a voter law another observation i saw when
[03:37:17.320 --> 03:37:23.480]  i was there one of the one of the minor speakers that was there uh was speaking and just threw out
[03:37:23.480 --> 03:37:30.280]  a phrase in spanish a token phrase just like uh cain did and it was interesting because he threw
[03:37:30.280 --> 03:37:37.640]  that out and he kind of waited as an applause line and he got crickets and then he said it in english
[03:37:37.640 --> 03:37:43.480]  and he got applause and i thought that's kind of interesting because i don't know if these people
[03:37:43.480 --> 03:37:49.160]  here who love to tout their diversity just as we see with julian castro do they really speak spanish
[03:37:49.160 --> 03:37:55.880]  you know there's a reason people speak english if you want to get ahead in this contemporary world
[03:37:55.880 --> 03:38:02.680]  you want to be able to speak english because english is the lingua franca of the 21st century folks
[03:38:02.680 --> 03:38:08.920]  like it or not it's been latin in the past it's been french in the past today it is english if
[03:38:08.920 --> 03:38:12.120]  you want to get ahead if you want the universal language that everybody seeks when we went to
[03:38:12.120 --> 03:38:19.320]  copenhagen to cover bill de berg all the signs were up in danish as well as in english really kind
[03:38:19.320 --> 03:38:24.360]  of strange and sometimes there would only be an english sign up they wouldn't have danish there
[03:38:24.360 --> 03:38:28.680]  there was a guy ahead of us in line who was a german he was very upset that there wasn't it
[03:38:28.680 --> 03:38:33.480]  there weren't any signs in german he said they used to teach uh german in the danish schools here
[03:38:33.480 --> 03:38:37.080]  he was arguing with a waiter in front of me uh he said something to him in german and the waiter
[03:38:37.080 --> 03:38:42.280]  didn't understand it so he's kind of upset about that look you have to understand the point of
[03:38:42.280 --> 03:38:47.800]  language is communication and we need to try to have a common communication so that we can
[03:38:47.800 --> 03:38:54.360]  all speak together that's especially important in government there's enough argument about what
[03:38:54.360 --> 03:39:00.680]  the clearly written constitution says when in amongst english speakers okay and so there's a
[03:39:00.680 --> 03:39:05.400]  lot of pervercation that goes along with that and it's going to be even worse if we start having
[03:39:05.400 --> 03:39:11.080]  multiple languages and government and when i look at this uh court decision striking down
[03:39:11.080 --> 03:39:17.240]  north carolina voter id law this is reported from politico uh if you remember a couple years ago
[03:39:17.800 --> 03:39:23.320]  they passed a law in north carolina saying that you would have to show uh picture id when you vote
[03:39:24.200 --> 03:39:28.840]  and i reported at the last election my brother-in-law told me that a friend of his
[03:39:28.840 --> 03:39:32.440]  told him he went to vote and in north carolina to vote all you do is you show up you give him
[03:39:32.440 --> 03:39:36.760]  your name and your address they look in their book and they say okay here it is he went to
[03:39:36.760 --> 03:39:41.560]  vote and they said well you've already voted he said no i haven't i said yeah you have and the
[03:39:41.560 --> 03:39:48.200]  other person at your address uh your has already voted goes that's my mother she's dead now he
[03:39:48.200 --> 03:39:52.680]  didn't make an issue of that he didn't go to the press he didn't want to come on and and uh talk
[03:39:52.680 --> 03:40:00.680]  with us on the record but look folks that happens there's a reason that you have photo id okay is
[03:40:00.680 --> 03:40:08.680]  it racist when the tsa asked to see your photo id before they'll let you get on a plane is it a
[03:40:08.680 --> 03:40:14.840]  problem when you have to show photo id when you cash a check okay is it is it racist for the dnc to
[03:40:14.840 --> 03:40:19.960]  ask for your photo id they were checking our id everywhere all the time different areas we go
[03:40:19.960 --> 03:40:25.800]  into every time we go into another uh inner circle of dantes inferno we would have to show them
[03:40:25.800 --> 03:40:33.000]  our id again okay now is that racist if it is then the dnc is racist the tsa is racist
[03:40:33.000 --> 03:40:38.760]  the shopping uh your grocery store is racist when you have to show your id to cash a check but we've
[03:40:38.760 --> 03:40:46.040]  got three judges two of them obama judges one of them a clinton judge and they unanimously said
[03:40:46.040 --> 03:40:52.200]  that it's racist to have to show a picture to verify your id if you vote because it's north
[03:40:52.200 --> 03:40:57.880]  carolina okay that's essentially what they're saying they said this they said the general assembly
[03:40:57.880 --> 03:41:03.080]  enacted these photo id laws in the immediate aftermath of unprecedented african-american
[03:41:03.080 --> 03:41:07.800]  voter participation in this state with a troubled racial history and racially polarized voting let
[03:41:07.800 --> 03:41:12.760]  me tell you something there was no immediate aftermath of an unprecedented african-american
[03:41:12.760 --> 03:41:19.800]  voter participation that's total baloney and they overturned a lower court fourth circuit ruling
[03:41:19.800 --> 03:41:28.200]  uh by u.s district court judge thomas schroeder a mammoth 485 page decision that he wrote just
[03:41:28.200 --> 03:41:35.000]  in april upholding the north carolina law they struck that down they said racist and you can't
[03:41:35.000 --> 03:41:40.120]  do this and of course there's no time folks for this to be appealed before the supreme court
[03:41:41.000 --> 03:41:46.520]  so you see when we're looking at kane and hillary clinton is trying to get somebody
[03:41:46.520 --> 03:41:53.000]  who is going to speak some token spanish in a midwestern accent okay it's about appealing
[03:41:53.000 --> 03:41:58.360]  to voters and i would say this illegal voters that she wants to bring into this country that's
[03:41:58.360 --> 03:42:02.280]  one of the ways she's going to rig this election that's why they're pushing back on this north
[03:42:02.280 --> 03:42:08.840]  carolina law it has absolutely nothing to do with some imaginary surge of black voters participating
[03:42:08.840 --> 03:42:14.680]  it has everything to do with making sure that illegal aliens are not voting illegally and
[03:42:14.680 --> 03:42:20.200]  to make sure that people don't vote multiple times you have a long period of time people can show up
[03:42:20.200 --> 03:42:24.760]  and all they have to do is go the phone book if such a thing still exists anywhere but all
[03:42:24.760 --> 03:42:29.800]  they have to do is look up people's names and addresses and you can go in and vote for those
[03:42:29.800 --> 03:42:34.840]  people before they show up and that's precisely what happened to our friend and one of the other
[03:42:34.840 --> 03:42:40.680]  things i think was interesting in the convention and i reported on this on friday before we went
[03:42:40.680 --> 03:42:46.840]  on thursday john mcnesby who was president of the fraternal order of police there in philadelphia
[03:42:46.840 --> 03:42:52.120]  said he was shocked and saddened by the planned choice of speakers at the democrat convention
[03:42:52.120 --> 03:42:56.280]  that was going to start the following monday in philadelphia he said the fraternal order of police
[03:42:56.280 --> 03:43:01.160]  is insulted and will not soon forget that the democratic party in hillary clinton are excluding
[03:43:01.160 --> 03:43:05.560]  the widows and other family members of police officers killed in the line of duty who were
[03:43:05.560 --> 03:43:11.080]  victims of explicit not implied racism in other words they were going to let families of blacks
[03:43:11.080 --> 03:43:16.200]  who'd been killed by police speak but they were not going to have any family members of police
[03:43:16.200 --> 03:43:21.000]  who had been killed i want to play this clip from jesse jackson in just a moment but he goes on to
[03:43:21.000 --> 03:43:28.680]  say it's sad to win an election it's sad that in order to win an election mrs clinton must pander
[03:43:28.680 --> 03:43:34.280]  to the interests of people who don't know all the facts while the men and women that they destroy
[03:43:34.280 --> 03:43:39.640]  are outside protecting the political institutions of this country in other words while you are
[03:43:39.640 --> 03:43:45.240]  demonizing us in the democrat convention we're going to be outside protecting you
[03:43:45.240 --> 03:43:51.800]  is what he was saying he said mrs clinton you should be ashamed of yourself if that's possible
[03:43:52.680 --> 03:43:57.560]  well i don't think she did it out of shame but it was interesting because that was that was done
[03:43:57.560 --> 03:44:04.440]  on thursday i reported that on friday we go there monday night on the floor of the dnc i talked to
[03:44:04.440 --> 03:44:12.760]  jesse jackson and here's what he had to say when i raised that issue to him tonight they're going to
[03:44:12.760 --> 03:44:18.520]  have families who we can talking about uh that have been killed by police uh but from what i
[03:44:18.520 --> 03:44:22.440]  understand they're not going to have any uh families of policemen who have been killed what
[03:44:22.440 --> 03:44:30.120]  what are your comments about that i wish we could share the pain of both uh because those who were
[03:44:30.120 --> 03:44:36.360]  shot unarmed did nothing to be killed the police were shot unarmed did nothing to be killed that
[03:44:36.360 --> 03:44:42.360]  must be some common commitment to stop the killing i think that for a season from trevon mongin to
[03:44:43.080 --> 03:44:49.960]  michael brown to the alo blackling killed by police the killing of police by people
[03:44:49.960 --> 03:44:54.840]  by two veterans of my dad uh is a recent thing but i hope that could be an appreciation
[03:44:55.400 --> 03:45:00.040]  the pain and unnecessary loss of both sides do you think that uh they should have to them speak
[03:45:00.920 --> 03:45:04.520]  do you think they should have had someone from the uh families that had just recently had the
[03:45:04.520 --> 03:45:08.840]  latest the most recent shootings in dalas they make they may make an adjustment i hope that they will
[03:45:09.480 --> 03:45:15.240]  thank you okay all right david night prayer for worse so he said they may make that adjustment
[03:45:15.240 --> 03:45:20.760]  i hope they will and they did just like they made an adjustment on the second night when they were
[03:45:20.760 --> 03:45:26.520]  criticized the first night for not having any american flags on stage they went out and got
[03:45:26.520 --> 03:45:30.680]  some flags daily call reported that they had two employees from city hall tell them that they got
[03:45:30.680 --> 03:45:37.080]  those flags from city hall at the last minute and just like the beard of putting those flags out there
[03:45:37.080 --> 03:45:40.760]  they weren't concerned about that when they were thinking about their convention it was an after
[03:45:40.760 --> 03:45:47.640]  thought okay and they used the police as a beard later on what they did was they brought in they
[03:45:47.640 --> 03:45:54.040]  added the dalas police chief they added a section there a tribute to fallen heroes to talk about
[03:45:54.040 --> 03:45:59.240]  the police so that was not something that they wanted to do they only did it because they were
[03:45:59.240 --> 03:46:05.320]  criticized you have to understand that and uh that's the way these guys have rolled uh and i
[03:46:05.320 --> 03:46:08.760]  think it's very interesting that they would do that i think it's also we put that jesse jackson
[03:46:08.760 --> 03:46:14.040]  was race baiting because you notice the cases that he talked about trevon martin michael brown he
[03:46:14.040 --> 03:46:19.880]  didn't talk about the clear cut cases of excessive police force he talked about the ones that were
[03:46:19.880 --> 03:46:25.320]  not clear cut the ones that were in the case of trevon martin they had jury trials they said he
[03:46:25.320 --> 03:46:30.200]  acted in self-defense they always like to throw up the ones that are the most controversial because
[03:46:30.200 --> 03:46:35.240]  that is part of the race baiting and they also threw out there oh by the way these guys were
[03:46:35.240 --> 03:46:41.000]  veterans okay in other words distancing the idea that they were motivated by black lives matter
[03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:47.480]  that's why we put that title up there that he was race baiting we've seen that kind of spin
[03:46:47.480 --> 03:46:52.120]  on this information from day one so they added them at the last minute they added the police to
[03:46:52.120 --> 03:47:00.600]  speak they also decided that they would go full on with the military and reason magazine says uh
[03:47:00.600 --> 03:47:07.720]  you can watch the scariest speech from both the rnc and the dnc it's john allen's unrestrained
[03:47:07.720 --> 03:47:14.040]  warmongering now how does this help her with bernie sanders supporters again it's like she did with
[03:47:15.080 --> 03:47:22.040]  with kane doubling down on the things that they don't like okay but here's how reason reported it
[03:47:22.040 --> 03:47:26.360]  they said he shouted in language that doubtlessly warmed the hearts of interventionists of both
[03:47:26.360 --> 03:47:32.680]  major parties it was balls out hawkishness delivered loudly at the highest decibel level possible
[03:47:32.680 --> 03:47:39.000]  garnered relatively little in the way of commentary or protest except from a few people in the arena
[03:47:39.000 --> 03:47:46.120]  itself in other words the party that has put itself out there as being anti-war had absolutely
[03:47:46.120 --> 03:47:50.600]  nothing to say about it and of course the mainstream media had absolutely nothing to say about what he
[03:47:50.600 --> 03:47:56.840]  was doing but here's what was said about this informed policy magazine this is duke university's
[03:47:56.840 --> 03:48:03.400]  peter fever he said for my money the absolute lowest point was when allen explicitly called on the
[03:48:03.400 --> 03:48:08.440]  active uniformed military to join in a political campaign he said every american in uniform and
[03:48:08.440 --> 03:48:14.360]  the white house or at home and they all chanted usa usa and of course there were people there
[03:48:14.360 --> 03:48:21.720]  that turned around said shut up uh usa is a is a uh trump slogan don't say that anyway they
[03:48:21.720 --> 03:48:27.240]  shouted usa he says we must be a force people in uniform must be a force for unity in america for
[03:48:27.240 --> 03:48:33.160]  vision that includes all of us all of us and the comment of fever he said it's hard to craft a more
[03:48:33.160 --> 03:48:39.000]  politicized call for the military to join in partisan politics than that and it's hard to
[03:48:39.000 --> 03:48:44.200]  find a bigger stage from which to make such a disturbing appeal than just before the candidate
[03:48:44.200 --> 03:48:51.640]  accepts her nomination okay now understand who this guy is john allen do you remember going back
[03:48:51.640 --> 03:48:58.600]  to the betray us leaks that he was accused of sending a lot of racy sexually charged emails
[03:48:58.600 --> 03:49:07.800]  to socialite jill kelly this is somebody who was um uh spoken of as the honorary ambassador to
[03:49:07.800 --> 03:49:12.840]  sent com to central command there in florida she was used by foreign governments to gain access
[03:49:12.840 --> 03:49:18.040]  to central command senior generals and a lot of those foreign governments most of them were
[03:49:18.040 --> 03:49:22.680]  middle eastern governments this is a lady who was born in lebanon okay they did a pentagon
[03:49:22.680 --> 03:49:28.680]  investigation at the time 20 to 30 000 pages of emails isn't it interesting that these emails always
[03:49:28.680 --> 03:49:34.200]  come in groups of 30 000 beginning to get suspicious about these figures that they're
[03:49:34.200 --> 03:49:38.360]  throwing out they always have 30 some odd thousand i guess that's just the number beyond
[03:49:38.360 --> 03:49:45.320]  which they can't count okay uh they've eventually said that he did not violate anything uh she was
[03:49:45.320 --> 03:49:50.200]  described as the other woman as she was accused of many things since the scandal erupted interestingly
[03:49:50.200 --> 03:49:57.880]  enough she accused paula broadwell uh the broad that betray us was exchanging emails with a thing
[03:49:57.880 --> 03:50:04.600]  that got him busted out of his position uh she accused paula broadwell of trying to blackmail her
[03:50:05.160 --> 03:50:09.960]  and i guess the question is you know what uh what did she have to blackmail her with
[03:50:09.960 --> 03:50:15.640]  what did she want in exchange because this is a person who was acting as a go between
[03:50:15.640 --> 03:50:19.640]  with a lot of these middle eastern governments okay now who is john allen well he was the guy
[03:50:19.640 --> 03:50:24.760]  that was exchanging emails with a socialite and he was somebody who was the commander of
[03:50:24.760 --> 03:50:30.920]  nato forces in afghanistan he had been nominated to become supreme allied commander of nato in
[03:50:30.920 --> 03:50:37.720]  europe they put that on hold while they investigated him and eventually he stepped down to say that he
[03:50:37.720 --> 03:50:43.640]  was going to retire now he hasn't retired he continues to show up at places like david portray
[03:50:43.640 --> 03:50:51.480]  his places like the bill berg group where he was in 2015 okay he has stayed connected perhaps i guess
[03:50:51.480 --> 03:50:56.680]  he feels that if he gets into clinton administration nobody will really pay any attention uh to his
[03:50:56.680 --> 03:51:00.440]  naughty emails he's going to look like a boy scout in that group stay with us we'll be right back

[03:55:34.440 --> 03:55:38.440]  convention again they wanted to appeal to the police to the military on that last night they
[03:55:38.440 --> 03:55:45.000]  wanted to make sure that they had a lot of people who are identity politics activists and so forth
[03:55:45.560 --> 03:55:51.720]  no major speakers to compete with hillary clinton he had governor qualmo speaking but that was much
[03:55:51.720 --> 03:55:56.440]  earlier way early in the evening they didn't want to have anybody there that was going to
[03:55:56.440 --> 03:56:01.960]  upstage her but the person who did upstage her was this kazir khan fellow because of the back
[03:56:01.960 --> 03:56:07.960]  and forth between he and donald trump now he goes on to say that if restrictions on muslim
[03:56:07.960 --> 03:56:12.760]  immigration had been in place decades ago he said i would have not been here none of my family would
[03:56:12.760 --> 03:56:18.360]  have been here okay we would have never been in america well you know what your son if it was up
[03:56:18.360 --> 03:56:25.400]  to donald trump would never have been in iraq he would have never been killed it was hillary clinton
[03:56:25.400 --> 03:56:31.640]  who wanted your son in that kind of a war theater as we just pointed out the last uh segment getting
[03:56:31.640 --> 03:56:37.640]  john allen out there to be one of the scariest warmongers at either convention and again bringing
[03:56:37.640 --> 03:56:43.240]  the military in in a very partisan way but who is this guy okay is he just some guy that they
[03:56:43.240 --> 03:56:50.280]  happened to read his essay and bring him in uh no he's got a long background as a matter of fact
[03:56:50.280 --> 03:56:55.640]  and there's some investigative reports on the american thinker as well as shubat showing where
[03:56:55.640 --> 03:57:01.640]  this guy's from first thing american thinker noticed was that this guy had a new york city address
[03:57:02.200 --> 03:57:07.400]  but he had a dc phone number and so they started looking at that they called the phone number they
[03:57:07.400 --> 03:57:13.000]  said well uh i was surprised he'd have a dc phone number with a new york city address so he called
[03:57:13.000 --> 03:57:18.120]  it to see who it was and they said no this isn't his law office but the man who answered it said he
[03:57:18.120 --> 03:57:23.240]  would not he would not tell him who it was then he looked up to see the domain name and yeah that
[03:57:23.240 --> 03:57:29.720]  website it was registered to him and it was registered uh very recently okay then they take
[03:57:29.720 --> 03:57:38.920]  a look at uh his connections to islam to sharia law to the muslim brotherhood this is some research
[03:57:38.920 --> 03:57:43.000]  that was done by shubat.com they say what the media is not telling you about the muslim who
[03:57:43.000 --> 03:57:47.800]  attacked donald trump he is a muslim brotherhood agent who wants to advance sharia law and bring
[03:57:47.800 --> 03:57:54.040]  muslims into the united states they point out and they show a document there a juristic classification
[03:57:54.040 --> 03:57:59.080]  of islamic law that he ran through okay his fascination with islamic law isn't the only
[03:57:59.080 --> 03:58:04.840]  issue because at the part uh at the bottom where he references his understanding of what
[03:58:04.840 --> 03:58:11.720]  uh sharia law is he references saeed ramadan who's head of the islamic center one of the people who
[03:58:11.720 --> 03:58:17.960]  have been uh he's a founder and hero of the muslim brotherhood look this guy is holding up a pocket
[03:58:17.960 --> 03:58:24.120]  constitution of course that became a bestseller on amazon.com he's not about the constitution folks
[03:58:24.120 --> 03:58:29.160]  this guy is really about sharia law but he knows maybe some of the liberals will grab a pocket
[03:58:29.160 --> 03:58:35.160]  constitution and actually read it they won't find anything in there about the right to immigration
[03:58:35.160 --> 03:59:01.160]  uh join us tonight on the nightly news seven central apm eastern
