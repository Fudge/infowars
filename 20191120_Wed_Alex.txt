[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:30.000 --> 00:44.000]  It is Wednesday, November 20th, 2019. I'm your host Alex Jones and we are going to be busy here on the broadcast today.
[00:44.000 --> 00:54.000]  President Trump is, as we speak, taking off from Washington D.C. on Air Force One and beginning the trip, the three-hour trip to Austin, Texas,
[00:54.000 --> 01:02.000]  where he's going to be with Tim Cook, one of our favorite people. I know I'm one of his favorite people, Mr. Crazy Eyes,
[01:02.000 --> 01:10.000]  the head of Apple that has the worst slave factories in the world and has moved its code keys and control of its company to communist China.
[01:10.000 --> 01:17.000]  He's going to be here in Austin at one of the few Apple factories left in the United States in North Austin,
[01:17.000 --> 01:23.000]  and I am intending to go up there right towards the end of the show and leave a little bit early.
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.000]  Tom Papert's going to be taking over for me. And then right into the fourth hour, Mike Adams is going to be hosting.
[01:29.000 --> 01:38.000]  We'll be up there giving you live coverage of that. And I do intend to deliver a message to the president via loudspeakers, via megaphone,
[01:38.000 --> 01:46.000]  that, okay, great, we'd like to have some factories here that don't have suicide nets around them and things. That's good.
[01:46.000 --> 01:54.000]  But we'd also like you, even though Ivanka and Jared are in a lip lock with Crazy Eyes,
[01:54.000 --> 01:57.000]  and go to dinner with them all the time, and that's admitted.
[01:57.000 --> 02:03.000]  I first heard that from Roger Stone like three years ago, and it was confirmed a couple years later, they're going to be here in Austin.
[02:03.000 --> 02:14.000]  And it would just be nice to not have first Tim Cook ban yours truly in Info Wars and lead the rest of Silicon Valley doing it.
[02:14.000 --> 02:24.000]  And then it would be nice to have that decried or spoken out against, because now they're doing it to pro-life sites.
[02:24.000 --> 02:30.000]  Now they're erasing Christmas holidays and things off the Google calendar, not the Apple calendar.
[02:30.000 --> 02:34.000]  That's actually in my stack of news today. It's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:34.000 --> 02:44.000]  Towns all over the U.S. and England are removing Christmas trees, because now they're saying that's a religious symbol.
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.000]  It actually is an ancient, druidic, Germanic symbol that was adopted by Christians.
[02:48.000 --> 02:59.000]  It's a heart of winter ritual with the evergreen tree hoping that the sun comes back when you're freezing in your hut,
[02:59.000 --> 03:05.000]  in your little cabin or your cave or your redoubt.
[03:05.000 --> 03:15.000]  But they want that removed as well. New Hampshire Town removes Christmas from Christmas ceremony after two people complain about being offended.
[03:15.000 --> 03:21.000]  Well, I'm offended by them. I'm offended by them harassing Chick-fil-A and harassing us.
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.000]  I mean, I really, at the end of the day, as a libertarian, do not judge people what they do in their bedrooms.
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.000]  But I do judge it when you use that to make it your identity and try to get access to our children and our culture
[03:32.000 --> 03:39.000]  and then demand all traditionalism be thrown on the fire of your petty will.
[03:39.000 --> 03:44.000]  And so, yes, this whole globalist leftist strategy is evil.
[03:44.000 --> 03:50.000]  And at the heart of it really is pedophilia and the destruction of innocence and the destruction of the future.
[03:50.000 --> 04:05.000]  And so today we're going to go deeply into that fetid rabbit hole and we're going to break down really some nightmarish information here
[04:05.000 --> 04:15.000]  with a very, very credible report and shocking audio of a man who was abused in satanic rituals by Bill Clinton and others.
[04:15.000 --> 04:22.000]  He was a child. The FBI thought this was very credible and then the FBI agent investigating it was killed.
[04:22.000 --> 04:29.000]  And then some of the other people involved were all murdered in D.C. and in New York.
[04:29.000 --> 04:33.000]  So now the original interview has been released to true pundit.
[04:33.000 --> 04:36.000]  We're going to be airing large excerpts of that.
[04:36.000 --> 04:43.000]  FBI interviews alleged boy rape victim of Bill Clinton chilling details of sex abuse rituals and more.
[04:43.000 --> 04:48.000]  And that ties into, of course, Adam Schiff and Ed Buck and the rituals going on there.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  It's all coming up.
[04:50.000 --> 04:54.000]  The religion is tyranny. The religion is predatory behavior.
[04:54.000 --> 04:59.000]  And we need to stop being sheep and laying down to it.
[04:59.000 --> 05:05.000]  Beto Roark came out dozens of times and said we're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles.
[05:05.000 --> 05:12.000]  And he got all the other Democrats on the stage, nine others, to agree and said that he was a hero.
[05:12.000 --> 05:13.000]  Think about that.
[05:13.000 --> 05:17.000]  Now those Democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control.
[05:17.000 --> 05:26.000]  Their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime.
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  They know what they're doing.
[05:28.000 --> 05:36.000]  And now the Supreme Court's come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms.
[05:36.000 --> 05:40.000]  My goodness, ladies and gentlemen, this country is under such incredible attack.
[05:40.000 --> 05:45.000]  But more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment
[05:45.000 --> 05:49.000]  and they're going to follow the original Bill of Rights and Constitution
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.000]  and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns.
[05:52.000 --> 05:55.000]  So you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens.
[05:55.000 --> 06:20.000]  Well, we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws.
[06:20.000 --> 06:28.000]  A lot of people ask me, Alex, why don't you yell and scream on air like you used to sometimes as much as you did in the past?
[06:28.000 --> 06:37.000]  And it's because if I did that, I'd actually, you know, overturn this desk and start ripping down the studio in here and God knows what else.
[06:37.000 --> 06:48.000]  I mean, I'm so angry now from the research we do on a daily basis and so focused and so awake that it's in between torture and ecstasy.
[06:48.000 --> 06:50.000]  I mean, I understand what's going on.
[06:50.000 --> 06:51.000]  I understand how to stop it.
[06:51.000 --> 06:52.000]  I see the master plan.
[06:52.000 --> 06:58.000]  I could see the globalist code and I know who they are and what they are and what they work for.
[06:58.000 --> 07:03.000]  And it should be so easy to just reject this and not go along with it.
[07:03.000 --> 07:14.000]  But the world is full of a lot of followers and a lot of people that seek petty power over others and we are a fallen species.
[07:14.000 --> 07:20.000]  We have a great potential to not be fallen and to go to the stars.
[07:20.000 --> 07:24.000]  We are falling here on this planet and it's all hidden in plain view.
[07:24.000 --> 07:34.000]  And we're not going to get off this planet until we start behaving like sentient beings that are not satanic, which is in our makeup and we're able to do it.
[07:34.000 --> 07:37.000]  But as you can see, we don't like to do that.
[07:37.000 --> 07:39.000]  We like to be bad.
[07:39.000 --> 07:43.000]  We like to be lazy and we like to be stupid.
[07:43.000 --> 07:44.000]  And it's a process.
[07:44.000 --> 08:02.000]  I'm certainly not perfect either, but I know I am a fallen creature and I am seething with understanding and awakening and destiny and potential to defeat the globalist and turn the tide just as you have that seed as well.
[08:02.000 --> 08:18.000]  And so I pray daily for calm and for focus and for justice and for clarity because I research probably six, seven hours a day, normally at night and in the morning and while I'm here at work.
[08:18.000 --> 08:29.000]  And there's always a great overriding frustration that I am not able to ever cover all of the news in the proper context that is taking place.
[08:29.000 --> 08:44.000]  Let me just give you an example of two big articles, one of which you're going to get details of exclusively with investigative journalist Tom Pappert coming up at the bottom of the hour that he'll be back hosting the third hour with me and then I'm going to veer off.
[08:44.000 --> 08:52.000]  Trump just left about 45 minutes late, so I'll be able to finish most of my broadcast and I'm going to go up and deliver a message directly to the president.
[08:52.000 --> 09:00.000]  I'm going to have to protest the president, but I'm going to deliver a very forceful message to the president and to that demon creature.
[09:00.000 --> 09:07.000]  He's traveling with Tim Cook being escorted by his daughter and son-in-law.
[09:07.000 --> 09:10.000]  So that's coming up.
[09:10.000 --> 09:29.000]  When I listened to this report yesterday, and then I went and did research from previous information I had and things I've been told by high level, Defense Department, FBI, and others years ago that I never talked about on air,
[09:29.000 --> 09:33.000]  just because I don't like to go over all the details about the torture of these children on air.
[09:33.000 --> 09:38.000]  I don't like to think about it quite frankly. Imagine them. They really don't want to talk about it.
[09:38.000 --> 09:46.000]  And I listened to this individual in this 30-minute interview that was taped several years ago in the Epstein investigation.
[09:46.000 --> 09:53.000]  Now, the FBI had investigator groups out doing this and the FBI agent heading it up was murdered.
[09:53.000 --> 09:58.000]  Of course, they tried to sweep that under the rug and others around it were murdered.
[09:58.000 --> 10:06.000]  And so now they've released the first interview that was done by investigators hired by the FBI before they took the case over.
[10:06.000 --> 10:15.000]  So dangerous the FBI actually hired investigators to do it so they could keep it secret from the bureau until they got it green lit by Trump.
[10:15.000 --> 10:24.000]  And then he was able to get it done. This deals with satanic rituals and blood drinking and ritualistic rape of children.
[10:24.000 --> 10:30.000]  And what is said here about the satanic rituals, I have never released on air for a lot of reasons.
[10:30.000 --> 10:37.000]  So I don't want people repeating them. And I don't want, when I get information, I want to know if people actually know what they're talking about.
[10:37.000 --> 10:44.000]  This is real. Now, the cherry on top of how real it is is the dead FBI agent and others surrounding it. A bunch of deaths.
[10:44.000 --> 10:53.000]  So you know that feeling you walk up to an edge of a cliff? When I was listening to this, I was on the edge of a cliff and I almost had to pull over last night.
[10:53.000 --> 11:00.000]  And I was listening to it the second time driving home at like eight o'clock at night because I started to want to throw up.
[11:00.000 --> 11:08.000]  And that was because my body was saying, kill, kill, kill, you're bad, kill, kill. I'm not going to kill anybody.
[11:08.000 --> 11:20.000]  But that's a normal response is as a man knowing this is going on and knowing these predators are out there, my physical body was beyond angry.
[11:20.000 --> 11:27.000]  And then before you go into real combat or kill somebody with bare hands, you throw up. That's not even an anxiety thing.
[11:27.000 --> 11:34.000]  You're just getting food out of your stomach to get down to business. And so we all need, quite frankly, therapy to even deal with this.
[11:34.000 --> 11:41.000]  Can you imagine being these children or these FBI agents? OK, now we're going to go ahead and play parts of this.
[11:41.000 --> 11:45.000]  I really don't want to listen to it. And I know you don't want to listen to it, but it needs to air.
[11:45.000 --> 11:50.000]  It needs to go out on radio stations and TV stations and the really graphic stuff has been bleeped out.
[11:50.000 --> 11:56.000]  But this is real. You can listen to it. It's real. If you know about these rituals, it's real.
[11:56.000 --> 12:05.000]  And the dead FBI and others, it's real, real. So I am in a controlled rage dealing with this.
[12:05.000 --> 12:11.000]  And I apologize for the crew having to be around me. But that's just the way it is.
[12:11.000 --> 12:23.000]  So we have that. Then we have this next big report from a great investigative journalist over at National File.
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.000]  It's a bunch of former Breitbart folks who are being censored.
[12:26.000 --> 12:36.000]  Video Pelosi's son ex-girlfriend claims forced abortion, abuse, weaponizing CPS, massive fraud.
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.000]  He denied that she was the girlfriend, but she has the text, the photos, the years of it.
[12:41.000 --> 12:48.000]  And all the proof has now been put out. It's a 59-minute video, and I watched this this morning
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  and became physically nauseous and disgusted as well.
[12:52.000 --> 12:58.000]  When you listen to what this Pelosi psychotic, this genetic psychotic, this is Nancy Pelosi's son did
[12:58.000 --> 13:04.000]  and the scams he runs and just how out of control and how he owns the jurisdiction of San Francisco,
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.000]  he can do whatever he wants. And he tells people that. And there's audio of that.
[13:08.000 --> 13:13.000]  And by the way, this is an hour of this. And I listened to the whole thing this morning.
[13:13.000 --> 13:18.000]  Even cut my workout short to listen to it. And they've got more tapes coming out.
[13:18.000 --> 13:25.000]  Now, let me explain something. This is the stuff that gets you killed.
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  And it's a major Epstein investigator that is working with Tom Papert bringing this out.
[13:29.000 --> 13:33.000]  I just want to point out, you know, we give medals to the military and everybody, and that's great. They deserve them.
[13:33.000 --> 13:37.000]  This is information warfare in America, and people get killed for stuff like this.
[13:37.000 --> 13:40.000]  Pelosi is a gangster. She kills people.
[13:40.000 --> 13:45.000]  So nationalfile.com, we salute you. They're the real journalists, and they've got a lot of former investigative journalists,
[13:45.000 --> 13:50.000]  some of the top folks from Breitbart over there. Some of them are even writing in pseudonyms.
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.000]  This is so dangerous. This is not a pseudonym. So we're taking the gloves off.
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.000]  That's what I've said everybody needs to do. People are doing it without me telling them.
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.000]  Obviously, real investigative journalism, bringing down the kingpins, hitting them at point-blank range.
[14:04.000 --> 14:09.000]  And you can't kill us all, Hillary. You can't kill us all, Bill. You can't kill us all, Pelosi.
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.000]  And, you know, Pelosi knows that. That's why they're like, oh, let's be friends with Republicans.
[14:13.000 --> 14:18.000]  Let's stop the calls for revolution because they know they're losing. Let me explain something.
[14:18.000 --> 14:24.000]  Toots. Your people start the violent revolution. You take out some of our people.
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.000]  You know there's nowhere in the world you're going to be able to go to get away from your crimes.
[14:28.000 --> 14:31.000]  And I'm just going to leave it at that. And they understand that.
[14:31.000 --> 14:34.000]  And they were supposed to have robots and AI by now to protect them.
[14:34.000 --> 14:39.000]  They know all their so-called protectors literally want to slip their throats.
[14:39.000 --> 14:44.000]  And you're about to see them go down. Now, it's going to be spectacular. It's going to be explosive.
[14:44.000 --> 14:49.000]  It's going to be super dangerous. And a lot of people aren't going to be here in the fight,
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  who were in the fight on the other side of this, but that really doesn't matter, does it?
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.000]  It's like Captain Ahab and Moby Dick. They both go down at the end.
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  You could decide who's Captain Ahab and Moby Dick, who's the good guy and who's the bad guy.
[15:01.000 --> 15:08.000]  But I think that's all pretty clear here, ladies and gentlemen, that this is the collapse of the globalist narrative.
[15:08.000 --> 15:12.000]  I watched all these senators and congresspeople yesterday.
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.000]  And then when I was watching the war room, when I was here working and then at night,
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  I stayed up till I went to bed at first for about an hour to rest.
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.000]  I got more than about four hours and went back to sleep a few hours.
[15:22.000 --> 15:27.000]  But I was watching the hearings on Epstein's murder and the senators were lying.
[15:27.000 --> 15:31.000]  And the Democrats were saying this too. No one believes this anymore. Total loss of faith.
[15:31.000 --> 15:36.000]  Everyone thinks there's pedophile rings running, everything. And the system's screwed.
[15:36.000 --> 15:40.000]  Yes, you're screwed. It's over. We all know your devil works.
[15:40.000 --> 15:45.000]  We know your blood drinking, child raping, vampires.
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.000]  You don't live forever, but the demons in you do live on body to body.
[15:50.000 --> 15:57.000]  So see, the archetypes are real. These are quasi-immortal blood-sucking demons.
[15:57.000 --> 16:03.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:03.000 --> 16:07.000]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:07.000 --> 16:13.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.000]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[16:44.000 --> 16:48.000]  that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[16:48.000 --> 16:53.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[16:53.000 --> 16:59.000]  Because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse
[16:59.000 --> 17:05.000]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:05.000 --> 17:11.000]  So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[17:11.000 --> 17:17.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com. Over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.

[18:00.000 --> 18:08.000]  About a month ago, President Trump announced that he was going to move his domicile from New York City to Florida,
[18:08.000 --> 18:13.000]  where he's always said he planned to retire too. And the left got so excited.
[18:13.000 --> 18:21.000]  They said, oh, he's about to resign and leave instead of facing impeachment and he's running to Florida.
[18:21.000 --> 18:26.000]  Well, now we know why the president did that. He knew the leftist controlled appeals courts.
[18:26.000 --> 18:33.000]  We're going to say that he had to give up his tax returns so they can pour over them and harass every business partner he's got.
[18:33.000 --> 18:37.000]  They want to terrorize people that he's worked with.
[18:37.000 --> 18:47.000]  And by moving his domicile from New York to Florida, that gets around the New York law they passed to get his tax returns that are supposed to be private.
[18:47.000 --> 18:52.000]  So all those people out there holding their breath for the president to resign.
[18:52.000 --> 18:58.000]  In his words, we're kicking the deep state's ass and he's never going to resign.
[18:58.000 --> 19:03.000]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up.
[19:03.000 --> 19:06.000]  I've said it many times, I will never give in.
[19:06.000 --> 19:10.000]  I will never give up, but I could give out.
[19:10.000 --> 19:24.000]  And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity, to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace.
[19:24.000 --> 19:28.000]  That most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech.
[19:28.000 --> 19:40.000]  And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word about newswords.com, infowords.com and band.video.
[19:40.000 --> 19:43.000]  And that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever.
[19:43.000 --> 19:51.000]  And that if you tell people, hey, the banned truth they don't want you to have is at infowords.com forward slash show and band.video.
[19:51.000 --> 19:58.000]  So take heart, folks, they've had to censor everybody to show everybody down because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[20:21.000 --> 20:24.000]  Mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[20:24.000 --> 20:28.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[20:28.000 --> 20:33.000]  Live from the infowords.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[20:44.000 --> 20:49.000]  Alright, let me do my best here to tell you what we're going to be laying out and start getting right into it.
[20:49.000 --> 21:03.000]  Obviously, the clown train that is the fake impeachment third round of public hearings now didn't just derail.
[21:03.000 --> 21:06.000]  It exploded as it went off the edge of a cliff.
[21:06.000 --> 21:17.000]  But Schiff continues to put his confidence act up because they're posing like they're the leaders, they're in charge and Trump did something wrong.
[21:17.000 --> 21:23.000]  And it diverts everyone and takes all the oxygen out of the room for all the real crimes, the Democrats and the globalists,
[21:23.000 --> 21:34.000]  and how they're trying to plunge the economy, how they're siding with China against us in the trade war, a whole Epstein inferno that's burning into the ground.
[21:34.000 --> 21:42.000]  It's on every network, it's everywhere, and it's literally setting the precedent that if Trump tries to engage in any foreign policy himself
[21:42.000 --> 21:51.000]  instead of a consortium of governmental bureaucrats who interface with think tanks, well, that's illegal.
[21:51.000 --> 21:52.000]  That's what I've said.
[21:52.000 --> 22:02.000]  We're ruled by interlocking boards of think tanks who build consensus on globalism and the sellout of the country.
[22:02.000 --> 22:06.000]  That's actually in the news today.
[22:06.000 --> 22:15.000]  Impeachment hearings raise questions. Who's in charge of U.S. foreign policy? Trump or interagency consensus, close quote.
[22:15.000 --> 22:21.000]  Because the human mole rat, he looks like a mole rat, he is a globalist mole, he's not a whistleblower.
[22:21.000 --> 22:40.000]  He's a vitamin in all his arrogance, and I'm Lieutenant Colonel, that's what you call me. And bug-eyed shift and all the rest of them, they are moles.
[22:40.000 --> 22:44.000]  So I'll be getting to those clips.
[22:44.000 --> 22:59.000]  You know, I know the globalists are into Satanism because it's about their power and about them willing to do extreme things and about corrupting those around them and getting them to be compromised like they are so they can trust them.
[22:59.000 --> 23:14.000]  And in these reports that the FBI agent and others got killed just this year, that's why it's coming out now, being leaked to True Pundit, the original interviews.
[23:14.000 --> 23:25.000]  That's why the operatives come in to the big accountants at the big accounting firm and they say, I'd have sex with this eight-year-old.
[23:25.000 --> 23:34.000]  And of course the couple doesn't want to do it, but they say, hey, you see the box over there on the wall? That's the camera. Have sex if you want this deal.
[23:34.000 --> 23:45.000]  And by the way, we got your blood. It's already been planted at a crime scene. We'll have you indicted anytime we want. Have sex with the kid.
[23:45.000 --> 23:52.000]  And that's exactly what they do. And they have compromised so many people.
[23:52.000 --> 24:06.000]  First they get you to cheat and manipulate, and then you get a few million bucks for the billions you manipulate and say the Pentagon budget.
[24:06.000 --> 24:18.000]  But that's not enough. You might turn state's evidence. You might not go to jail if you expose what they've done, but none of you and your wife have had sex with an eight-year-old boy.
[24:18.000 --> 24:25.000]  You're never going to talk about that. And if you did, it'd be so horrible no one would want to believe it and they'd want to cover it up.
[24:25.000 --> 24:33.000]  It's like the Catholic Church. The deputy pope got convicted of trafficking over 100 little boys as young as age five up to about age 14.
[24:33.000 --> 24:40.000]  And they would tell the other people in the seminary, you have sex with kids or you're not going to be a priest.
[24:40.000 --> 24:47.000]  Just like the Boy Scouts, just like Penn State, just like Boys Town, just like everything.
[24:47.000 --> 24:56.000]  Most of these people don't even want to do it.
[24:56.000 --> 25:02.000]  You know, I've been told about people that were abused by Bill Clinton, not just Kathy O'Brien, but others.
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.000]  Stuff that's in this report that never has been published and never been known.
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.000]  And I've researched other real Satanism files that the public hasn't seen.
[25:10.000 --> 25:16.000]  Some of them have come out recently in the Finders, and it's exactly what they do.
[25:16.000 --> 25:20.000]  But you add the dead FBI's and the others that have been killed that were investigating it.
[25:20.000 --> 25:22.000]  That's when you really know it's real.
[25:22.000 --> 25:28.000]  You listen to this poor man, he's now 26 years old, being raped since he's age three.
[25:28.000 --> 25:35.000]  It's on newswars.com, infowars.com.
[25:35.000 --> 25:39.000]  And it's exactly what I was told, like Bill Clinton didn't want to cut the children.
[25:39.000 --> 25:52.000]  He just wanted to have sex with them, and they've got the women different ages from little girls up to women on pedestals.
[25:52.000 --> 25:59.000]  And then they have chalices and gather their blood and then drink it.
[25:59.000 --> 26:05.000]  That's exactly the type of rituals I even know the name of that ritual.
[26:05.000 --> 26:10.000]  But that this is the real deal, folks, the real deal.
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  And so when you wonder, why are they so evil? Why are they so bad?
[26:14.000 --> 26:22.000]  Because evil had to recruit a cohort, a cadre, a legion of evil that would carry out the post-human world,
[26:22.000 --> 26:27.000]  that would poison their own species, that would put up the electromagnetic systems that give us cancer,
[26:27.000 --> 26:30.000]  that would feed us the GMO, that would destroy our attention spans,
[26:30.000 --> 26:37.000]  that would deploy computers and systems designed to destroy our very humanity and make us depressed and control us.
[26:37.000 --> 26:40.000]  And that's all admitted by Silicon Valley.
[26:40.000 --> 26:47.000]  It's the apple, the knowledge of evil that Eve gave Adam.
[26:47.000 --> 26:52.000]  And what does apple symbol? Made in slave factories and enslaving your mind.
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  It's an apple with a bite out of it.
[26:54.000 --> 26:58.000]  The knowledge of good was there, how to be good, how to be just,
[26:58.000 --> 27:04.000]  but then it was the knowledge of manipulation and corruption and how to control and how to feed on fellow humans
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.000]  and how to keep people stupid so you dominate them.
[27:08.000 --> 27:13.000]  And so we're now being force-fed the apple.
[27:13.000 --> 27:17.000]  And then to live in the system, in this new environment, we're going to have to hurt fellow humans
[27:17.000 --> 27:23.000]  and do bad things and trample on others so that there's no one left at the end to stand up for ourselves.
[27:23.000 --> 27:29.000]  And humanity is atomized and separated and defeated.
[27:29.000 --> 27:33.000]  Can you guys pull up the logo of apple, please?
[27:33.000 --> 27:37.000]  What an evil symbol in your face, the apple of forbidden knowledge.
[27:37.000 --> 27:44.000]  The apple of the knowledge of good and evil.
[27:44.000 --> 27:47.000]  Just give me Dr. Kim shots as soon as we can. It's all right.
[27:47.000 --> 27:54.000]  I mean, this is all just right out in the open, ladies and gentlemen,
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  because they metaphysically have to put it out in the open.
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.000]  And what is it? It's a poison apple.
[28:01.000 --> 28:14.000]  What is the witch in Snow White give the young, prepubescent girl who's going into puberty?
[28:14.000 --> 28:18.000]  She goes to the mirror and she says, who's the fairest of the all? It's not you.
[28:18.000 --> 28:21.000]  She wants that essence.
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  She wants the girl's heart cut out.
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  I mean, too much if she wanted to drink the blood or bathe the blood.
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.000]  She wants the woodsman to cut the heart out.
[28:30.000 --> 28:38.000]  And then when that doesn't work, she pours her hatred and her essence into a poison and puts it into the apple
[28:38.000 --> 28:42.000]  so that she can trick her and get her to bite into it and put her into a deep trance
[28:42.000 --> 28:46.000]  so she doesn't know who she is, the real queen, the real goddess of the future,
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.000]  but only a prince, a man standing up for her who loves her can free her.
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.000]  But we're not going to free the little girls and little boys, are we?
[28:53.000 --> 29:21.000]  We're going to let the witch shit there and torture the living hell out of them.
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[29:23.000 --> 29:25.000]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:25.000 --> 29:29.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[29:29.000 --> 29:32.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:32.000 --> 29:58.000]  Everybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[29:58.000 --> 30:02.000]  Major report out of major university.
[30:02.000 --> 30:06.000]  Researchers working on food-based treatment to slow aging science daily.
[30:06.000 --> 30:13.000]  Probiotics in the gut of a particular type cause your entire body to be healthier and make you live longer and make you not get intestinal cancer.
[30:13.000 --> 30:17.000]  We have the very best formula, literally, with what they even mentioned in the studies.
[30:17.000 --> 30:29.000]  And it explains the hormone called FGF21, pro longevity, heals the entire body and actually reverses aging, but is only made in the lower intestine.
[30:29.000 --> 30:30.000]  Oh, and what does it say?
[30:30.000 --> 30:35.000]  It's fiber from a spectrum of certain types of berries that grows this.
[30:35.000 --> 30:37.000]  And yes, this is a plug, gut fusion.
[30:37.000 --> 30:39.000]  And what do we have in this?
[30:39.000 --> 30:45.000]  High auric berry blend, strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, cranberry, escoglio, grape and pomegranate.
[30:45.000 --> 30:49.000]  It's the pulp from them that then grows this.
[30:49.000 --> 30:52.000]  Gut fusion for children, for young people, for old people, for everybody.
[30:52.000 --> 30:54.000]  This is fiber and glutamine.
[30:54.000 --> 30:55.000]  You're not going to find a better formula.
[30:55.000 --> 30:57.000]  Gut fusion, it's amazing.
[30:57.000 --> 30:58.000]  Infoorstore.com.
[30:58.000 --> 31:00.000]  Infoorstore.com.
[31:00.000 --> 31:06.000]  We have a new product, and we got several thousand of these in, and they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them.
[31:06.000 --> 31:11.000]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste.
[31:11.000 --> 31:18.000]  And it doesn't compete with super blue that's four to five of colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride-free.
[31:18.000 --> 31:20.000]  The adult or the children's.
[31:20.000 --> 31:23.000]  These are both excellent toothpaste, concentrates that don't have fillers.
[31:23.000 --> 31:24.000]  People love it.
[31:24.000 --> 31:33.000]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans, but also re-mineralizes the teeth.
[31:33.000 --> 31:39.000]  Then it has the patented silver salt, silver in it to knock out the bacteria that causes gingivitis.
[31:39.000 --> 31:40.000]  This is all proven.
[31:40.000 --> 31:53.000]  It may claims with this, but I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[31:53.000 --> 31:54.000]  So we're really proud of it.
[31:54.000 --> 31:55.000]  It funds the operation.
[31:55.000 --> 31:56.000]  Infoorstore.com.
[31:56.000 --> 32:00.000]  And that's why we're still on air, thanks to you.
[32:00.000 --> 32:09.000]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true, but I'm here to tell you, most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball.
[32:09.000 --> 32:11.000]  I could see where the globalists were going.
[32:11.000 --> 32:15.000]  I could see what their in-game agenda was, what their goal was.
[32:15.000 --> 32:34.000]  And I knew that when they were setting us up to be de-platformed, that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody off air, to silence everyone, to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed.
[32:34.000 --> 32:40.000]  But the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future.
[32:40.000 --> 32:51.000]  It was the model of InfoWars as much as the information that had to be silenced, because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed.
[32:51.000 --> 33:09.000]  That's why keeping InfoWars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever.
[33:09.000 --> 33:22.000]  More media giants are banding together to take down controversial InfoWars content from their site.
[33:22.000 --> 33:25.000]  How did you decide to ban Alex Jones?
[33:25.000 --> 33:31.000]  What users want from us and what we've always provided them is a curated platform.
[33:31.000 --> 33:46.000]  We think that what the user wants is someone that does review these apps, someone that does review the podcast, someone that on Apple News where a human is selecting the top stores.
[33:46.000 --> 33:48.000]  And that's what we do.
[33:48.000 --> 33:53.000]  We don't take a political stand. We're not leaning one way or the other.
[33:53.000 --> 34:02.000]  We don't tell that from the stuff on the app store and in podcasts, etc. You'll see everything from very conservative to very liberal.
[34:02.000 --> 34:04.000]  And that's the way I think it should be.
[34:04.000 --> 34:08.000]  But at what point were you like, okay, that's it. Alex Jones has to go.
[34:08.000 --> 34:21.000]  You know, we get into a singular kind of event, but I think there's enough there that reasonable people could agree that if you're going to curate, that that should be all.
[34:21.000 --> 34:30.000]  Looking live there at the White House lawn, Alex Jones, the controversial host, Trump's supporter, out there with a bullhorn.
[34:30.000 --> 34:32.000]  And that's what you heard earlier.
[34:32.000 --> 34:39.000]  President Trump started a great job rebooting this country, but he hasn't stood up against Big Tech and the censorship.
[34:39.000 --> 34:52.000]  Big Tech has been caught in undercover videos of their own documents and whistleblowers suppressing the speech of Christians and conservatives and veterans. And the left is planning on using this to steal the next election.
[34:52.000 --> 34:57.000]  President Trump must take action against Big Tech like a tearing right now.
[34:57.000 --> 35:12.000]  President Trump must enforce the First Amendment in section 230 of the Telecommunications Act and stop Big Tech from making censors. The American people demand that their First Amendment be a defender.
[35:12.000 --> 35:15.000]  Wow, look at that. That was three months ago.
[35:15.000 --> 35:33.000]  And as you can see, I've lost for a TV viewer more than 30 pounds because I'm taking DNA Force Plus, I'm taking X2 and X3, and ladies and gentlemen, I'm taping gut fusion fiber and glutamine.
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  So incredibly good for the body.
[35:35.000 --> 35:46.000]  Counter is what the globalists are doing, and I'm working out the same amount, but I am religiously taking the supplements, taking the fish oil, especially at night when I go to bed.
[35:46.000 --> 35:51.000]  These are really high quality products that will make your life better and they fund this operation.
[35:51.000 --> 35:59.000]  Now, Trump is coming to town today. He'll be here in about two hours and 40 minutes.
[35:59.000 --> 36:11.000]  I will be ducking out coming up in the third hour. Tom Pappers is going to take over to break huge news that goes right to the heart of the system and what makes them operate and how to bring them down.
[36:11.000 --> 36:16.000]  And then Mike Adams is host of the fourth hour and I'll be popping in on there as well.
[36:16.000 --> 36:23.000]  Trump is coming to North Austin to the Apple subcontractor. In fact, we can put that address maybe a little bit later on screen.
[36:23.000 --> 36:32.000]  Trump off Palmer Lane off 183 near Mopac and already we're going to have Will Johnson and others out there with the crew.
[36:32.000 --> 36:40.000]  I think they're there by now. You've got a bunch of anti-fund, a bunch of globalists there protesting Trump.
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.000]  Well, I'm going to be there with a message for them, but also a message for Trump.
[36:44.000 --> 37:02.000]  I'm protesting Trump, but I'm going to be protesting Apple moving most of its jobs to China, Apple helping censor the American people and the Chinese people and helping block Vietnamese and of course the Taiwanese and of course Hong Kong flags, all three of those flags.
[37:02.000 --> 37:12.000]  They don't just like to have being able to be sent because it's seen as solidarity with Vietnam that China is at war with and it's seen as solidarity with Hong Kong and Taiwan.
[37:12.000 --> 37:17.000]  So you can't send those symbols that's been in the news and now the Chai comms have invaded Hong Kong.
[37:17.000 --> 37:23.000]  They burned up the epic times there. We're going to get to all of that start of the next hour.
[37:23.000 --> 37:29.000]  So that's where this fight is. And Jared Kushner, who I'm not an enemy of.
[37:29.000 --> 37:38.000]  I don't buy into the hype that he's this bad guy just because he bought a building for twice its price at 666 Park Avenue in New York.
[37:38.000 --> 37:47.000]  Or just because his dad went to prison for really bizarre behavior and I want to think the best of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.
[37:47.000 --> 38:01.000]  I'm just told that they're big leftist and I know they hang out constantly with Tim Cook and that they're coming today with daddy and Tim Cook and you know, Apple's really a corrupt evil company.
[38:01.000 --> 38:09.000]  And they said a year and a half ago in Reuters, we've merged with the Chinese government and their intelligence agencies have the Apple code keys to all of your Apple devices.
[38:09.000 --> 38:21.000]  So if you think Huawei's bad and that's Chinese communist run, well, so is Apple. It's a globalist partnership against America and they see this very woke to be against the country and against the U.S.
[38:21.000 --> 38:26.000]  And they think we're done because they've already bought off the establishment and they think Trump's just a speed hump to what they're doing.
[38:26.000 --> 38:34.000]  So I've always made the joke that, you know, if Trump's cleaning out the goblins in the swamp in Mordor, he's going to have to have some goblin guides.
[38:34.000 --> 38:39.000]  He's going to have to be around some goblins. I just don't want to see him kissing goblins. I don't want to see him succubus with goblins.
[38:39.000 --> 38:42.000]  I don't want to see him in bed with a goblin.
[38:42.000 --> 38:50.000]  And unless he repudiates him some for the censorship and what he's doing tells him to stop it and make some move in that direction.
[38:50.000 --> 38:56.000]  Then Trump is to a great extent, even though he's trying to promote Apple having a few factories move back here.
[38:56.000 --> 39:03.000]  This is one of the few. I get that's a positive thing, but they've got hundreds in China and maybe one or two that are still open.
[39:03.000 --> 39:09.000]  I know they had three, but I heard one of them close. I think it's like two factories that actually manufacture things.
[39:09.000 --> 39:12.000]  And I'm glad that this factory's there and has 15,000 employees.
[39:12.000 --> 39:20.000]  It's at 5,000 now about to ramp up, we're told by Tim Cook. So that's a good thing, but he's in bed with a goblin.
[39:20.000 --> 39:28.000]  And if anybody is goblin-like or golem-like, it would be Tim Cook with those big old saucer eyes, whatever he's on.
[39:28.000 --> 39:32.000]  Maybe he's got a brain chip. No one's sure. So that's coming up.
[39:32.000 --> 39:37.000]  But seriously, the globalists are really down my neck. They want to shut this operation down.
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.000]  They've shut most people down. They've done all sorts of dirty tricks, all the fake lawsuits.
[39:41.000 --> 39:48.000]  We can continue info wars and other permutations and do a lot of things that will keep this message on the air and even stronger.
[39:48.000 --> 39:56.000]  But I can tell you, everybody needs fish oil. Everybody needs protein bars. Everybody needs high quality energy boost, 10-hour clean energies.
[39:56.000 --> 40:04.000]  What turbo force is. Great new tropic brain force. Everybody needs to be on DNA Force Plus with the best BQQ and CoQ 10 and all the great things it does.
[40:04.000 --> 40:09.000]  Everybody needs to be on a good clean atomic iodine. We've got several great types.
[40:09.000 --> 40:13.000]  Everybody needs really good tooth whitening toothpaste. Nobody else has got it with this nano silver.
[40:13.000 --> 40:16.000]  We have the other one with the iodine super blue. Those are both proprietary and amazing.
[40:16.000 --> 40:21.000]  If you'll just get things you need that are top of the line and great, it'll fund the operation and we'll be here.
[40:21.000 --> 40:27.000]  But I got to tell you, I've been on there 25 years and the stuff going on is an existential threat.
[40:27.000 --> 40:35.000]  And if info wars is taken off the air, so many big stories that broke that really wounded the globalist wouldn't break and in the future won't break.
[40:35.000 --> 40:42.000]  So they want to take this operation down. So take action, infowarstore.com today and get in there and get some of the products.
[40:42.000 --> 40:50.000]  I suggest DNA Force and X2 and or X3 and selenium. Those are the type of things that most people have no idea what they'll do for you.
[40:50.000 --> 40:54.000]  You're either deficient in it or you never experience real PQQ or CoQ 10.
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.000]  If you don't know what PQQ and CoQ 10 do, just get a bottle of DNA Force Plus.
[40:58.000 --> 41:02.000]  It's very expensive to get good PQQ and CoQ 10. We have both the best types in it.
[41:02.000 --> 41:07.000]  A lot of other high quality ingredients. Similar brands of this would be $300, $400 because they market up a lot.
[41:07.000 --> 41:14.000]  You know, if somebody's putting $50 as a product and a bottle, they're going to market up to $200.
[41:14.000 --> 41:20.000]  Well, we don't do that. I made an even better deal and made huge purchases of DNA Force in a two year contract.
[41:20.000 --> 41:27.000]  It comes in every three months to be able to bring it to you for the price of $125.
[41:27.000 --> 41:34.000]  So right now it's $74, ladies and gentlemen, and I got the price down from close to $50 a bottle to lower than that.
[41:34.000 --> 41:41.000]  So I can do this and still fund our operation, but you're not going to get PQQ and CoQ 10 in a formula like this anywhere near this price.
[41:41.000 --> 41:49.000]  So it's a total 360 complete win. In fact, when we reformulated it, we made it even stronger and better when I got the new deal to get it at less the price than I have.
[41:49.000 --> 41:53.000]  But again, I had to sign a two year contract. That contract is almost up.
[41:53.000 --> 42:07.000]  We've got to renegotiate it in February and we're going to have to never do a price like this or I'm going to have to raise the price or something like that and then not do as big a discount because that is really unprecedented.
[42:07.000 --> 42:14.000]  Okay, we're going to go to break and Tom Pappert of National File, great investigative journalist and TV station manager.
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.000]  He's working with a lot of former investigative journalists from Breitbart and other groups.
[42:18.000 --> 42:23.000]  We're just too hardcore, you know, once the takeover of Breitbart happened, nothing against Breitbart.
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.000]  They're just not as hardcore as they used to be, at least they're free speech.
[42:26.000 --> 42:33.000]  And we understand what happened to them. We understand how the global stop rate, but it's pretty much, you know, do this, we're going to kill you.
[42:33.000 --> 42:37.000]  When you say, okay, we'll do what you got to do. Just hope I don't see it coming.
[42:37.000 --> 42:43.000]  But we're going to break Pelosi news that's the biggest ever and goes to the heart of who and her son really are.
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  And this could bring this monster down.
[42:45.000 --> 42:53.000]  You talk about me too movement, you talk about fraud, you talk about criminal activity, you talk about her son using the speaker of the house's power illegally.
[42:53.000 --> 42:57.000]  They've caught them red handed. We have the video, the audio, the text messages, everything.
[42:57.000 --> 43:04.000]  Beto Rourke came out dozens of times and said, we're going to confiscate all your semi automatic rifles.
[43:04.000 --> 43:11.000]  And he got all the other Democrats on the stage, nine others to agree and said that he was a hero.
[43:11.000 --> 43:12.000]  Think about that.
[43:12.000 --> 43:16.000]  Now, those Democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control.
[43:16.000 --> 43:25.000]  Their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime.
[43:25.000 --> 43:27.000]  They know what they're doing.
[43:27.000 --> 43:35.000]  And now the Supreme Court's come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms.
[43:35.000 --> 43:39.000]  My goodness, ladies and gentlemen, this country is under such incredible attack.
[43:39.000 --> 43:48.000]  But more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment and they're going to follow the original Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[43:48.000 --> 43:51.000]  And they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns.
[43:51.000 --> 43:54.000]  So you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens.
[43:54.000 --> 43:58.000]  Well, we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws.
[43:58.000 --> 44:03.000]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson.
[44:03.000 --> 44:11.000]  What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to?
[44:11.000 --> 44:12.000]  How far will they go?
[44:12.000 --> 44:13.000]  What's their limit?
[44:13.000 --> 44:20.000]  And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[44:20.000 --> 44:23.000]  The answer is there is no limit to evil.
[44:23.000 --> 44:26.000]  It is a bottomless pit.
[44:26.000 --> 44:33.000]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist or that there's no free will.
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  There's no devil or the God.
[44:35.000 --> 44:45.000]  But those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like.
[44:45.000 --> 44:49.000]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us.
[44:49.000 --> 44:51.000]  Oxford's banned clapping.
[44:51.000 --> 44:59.000]  Universities in the U.S. have banned 21 Gun Salutes for veterans. These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[44:59.000 --> 45:04.000]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up.
[45:04.000 --> 45:07.000]  I've said it many times, I will never give in.
[45:07.000 --> 45:10.000]  I will never give up, but I could give out.
[45:10.000 --> 45:16.000]  And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity.
[45:16.000 --> 45:24.000]  To see evil running rampant like this and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace.
[45:24.000 --> 45:28.000]  That most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech.
[45:28.000 --> 45:38.000]  And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word about news wars dot com,
[45:38.000 --> 45:47.000]  info wars dot com and banned dot video. And that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever and that if you tell people, hey, the banned truth they don't want you to have,
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.000]  is it info wars dot com forward slash show and banned dot video.
[45:51.000 --> 45:59.000]  So take heart folks, they've had to censor everybody to show everybody down because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[45:59.000 --> 46:10.000]  There's a famous quote by Marine Corps General in the Korean War when three million Chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the Marines.
[46:10.000 --> 46:14.000]  More than 50 to one some estimates have it.
[46:14.000 --> 46:19.000]  But the point is they were outnumbered and the general was told general were completely surrounded.
[46:19.000 --> 46:23.000]  He said good, we can attack in all directions.
[46:23.000 --> 46:33.000]  Well, that's the point that info wars has reached and it really is epic. It really is biblical and we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support.
[46:33.000 --> 46:40.000]  But it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete.
[46:40.000 --> 46:52.000]  And it's not just Americans, but folks all over the world are completely silenced when it comes to speak in the name of a CIA fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile or speaking out against dangerous vaccines.
[46:52.000 --> 46:57.000]  Because by info wars having its own platform that checkmates the globalists.
[47:22.000 --> 47:27.000]  From the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[47:27.000 --> 47:54.000]  Tom Papert is going to be hosting the fourth hour today so he can go through large parts of this hour long breakdown that is absolutely vital to go viral.
[47:54.000 --> 48:01.000]  And it is going viral right now as we speak.
[48:01.000 --> 48:11.000]  Pelosi's son ex-girlfriend claims he forced abortion abuse weaponizing CPS massive fraud.
[48:11.000 --> 48:14.000]  And then she's got the text messages the video all of it.
[48:14.000 --> 48:19.000]  This guy tries to deny it's even his girlfriend or that one of the children is probably his.
[48:19.000 --> 48:25.000]  Again putting his own children in foster care and threatened her to do that and then did it.
[48:25.000 --> 48:31.000]  But this was what goes on in the kingdom of Nancy Pelosi and imagine if Brett Kavanaugh had actually done this.
[48:31.000 --> 48:36.000]  So we have to go after these people for the real things they're doing.
[48:36.000 --> 48:39.000]  Trump's not going to do it. The just department's probably not going to do it for a while.
[48:39.000 --> 48:43.000]  We have to lead. You know we led exposing Jeffrey Epstein.
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  Now it's all over the news.
[48:45.000 --> 48:48.000]  Now Congress admits it. I'll play some clips of that in a moment.
[48:48.000 --> 48:55.000]  But Tom Papert will be here in the third hour and he is obviously not going to have time into air the entire hour long interview.
[48:55.000 --> 48:58.000]  It's linked up on infowars.com.
[48:58.000 --> 49:03.000]  Big article. Big investigative report by Patrick Howley, national file.com.
[49:03.000 --> 49:12.000]  Again it's a great site. It's a 12 page investigative report and it is going super viral out there right now.
[49:12.000 --> 49:23.000]  We've also added to this article on infowars the live feed so that when people are tuned in they can also find the article and hear more about this and understand what's going on.
[49:23.000 --> 49:26.000]  But that's why all the censorship is taking place.
[49:26.000 --> 49:32.000]  Now remember just 16 months ago it was Alex Jones being censored and it was only going to be him.
[49:32.000 --> 49:38.000]  And then it was Republican members of Congress being censored by Facebook, Twitter, YouTube.
[49:38.000 --> 49:44.000]  And then it was again the Taiwanese and the Hong Kong and other emojis by Apple.
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.000]  Because China said we don't want their flags available.
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.000]  And clicking their heels they said yes sir.
[49:50.000 --> 49:53.000]  Well now it's Eric Sierra Mola.
[49:53.000 --> 49:56.000]  Even though you're supposed to be public and senators have said his name.
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.000]  Oh no but now we're told there isn't a whistleblower or he's not the whistleblower.
[49:59.000 --> 50:02.000]  Schiff met with a whistleblower. He's very impressed. Oh I never met with a whistleblower.
[50:02.000 --> 50:08.000]  And vitamin getting caught lying. People are like why aren't you covering the impeachment?
[50:08.000 --> 50:12.000]  We're into three weeks of crap. It's totally staged. It's ridiculous.
[50:12.000 --> 50:15.000]  We already know all this. We're tomorrow's news today.
[50:15.000 --> 50:20.000]  Look at this article. Facebook blocks posts on BIM support for border fence.
[50:20.000 --> 50:28.000]  It's an article with a video of Democrats saying we need a border fence up until Trump got in.
[50:28.000 --> 50:33.000]  And they just blocked it. That's control of history ladies and gentlemen.
[50:33.000 --> 50:39.000]  Remember Google said the Republican Party's main affiliation is Nazis on Google.
[50:39.000 --> 50:44.000]  And Trump does nothing. He'll be hanging out with Tim Cook today.
[50:44.000 --> 50:47.000]  Who runs the worst factories on the planet with suicide deaths.
[50:47.000 --> 50:50.000]  And again I'm a big supporter of Trump. Glad it's not Hillary.
[50:50.000 --> 50:55.000]  But when it comes to saying he's going to take action on big tech censorship it's coming.
[50:55.000 --> 51:01.000]  It's going to be strong action. You heard that six months ago. Where is it? Where is it?
[51:01.000 --> 51:06.000]  And now turning point USA. And the rest of them are acting worse than leftists.
[51:06.000 --> 51:12.000]  Blocking whole groups of people from coming and asking questions at their events.
[51:12.000 --> 51:19.000]  And Trump signed an executive order saying he'll take money away from universities if they let groups do that.
[51:19.000 --> 51:27.000]  So the neocons and ever Trumpers are taking over Trump. And so if you want to know why people like Matt Drudge are pissed at him.
[51:27.000 --> 51:32.000]  There's your answer. I mean Drudge links to my super hardcore stuff.
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  Trump why are you saying you're for red flag laws. Better not do that.
[51:34.000 --> 51:37.000]  Hey Trump do something about censorship or we're done with you.
[51:37.000 --> 51:41.000]  He would top link that. That's Drudge's message to the president.
[51:41.000 --> 51:45.000]  Now I'm not going to abandon the president but there's a split here.
[51:45.000 --> 51:51.000]  Because if you support him and then he's like Hillary light. Well if Hillary was in she wouldn't have gotten away with this I think.
[51:51.000 --> 51:58.000]  I'm glad she got beaten. And we'll talk about that more but Tom you're taking over just like an hour and eight minutes from now.
[51:58.000 --> 52:04.000]  The third hour I'm going up to deliver my message up there in North Austin at the big Apple facility.
[52:04.000 --> 52:09.000]  We'll put that address on screen for you here in a minute for TV viewers. I'll give that out but everybody should come out there.
[52:09.000 --> 52:19.000]  And there'll be a bunch of leftists too and just let Trump know that hey we're glad that you are moving a few factories back to the U.S.
[52:19.000 --> 52:24.000]  That's wonderful. Pat Tim Cook on the head for that but it's like we need him to get off the neck of the First Amendment.
[52:24.000 --> 52:31.000]  But separately let's get a national file on this huge report and some of the clips and what's coming up next hour.
[52:31.000 --> 52:37.000]  Well Alex I want to say that you're right. I mean there is this massive discrepancy in this country like the GDP is growing.
[52:37.000 --> 52:43.000]  The stock market is up. Oh boy. Meanwhile people like you people like millions of Americans are being censored.
[52:43.000 --> 52:52.000]  Some people are losing their jobs because of this censorship. So it's very ironic and it does feel at times like President Trump is being coopted by the neocons in his midst.
[52:52.000 --> 52:56.000]  And I think you warned that that could very well happen all the way back in 2017.
[52:56.000 --> 53:02.000]  So I just want to commend you on your foresight and your honesty for actually telling it like it is.
[53:02.000 --> 53:07.000]  Tom national flags aren't allowed on on the A.I. watching what you're doing.
[53:07.000 --> 53:13.000]  Now people that import are having trouble sending them. Now you can't play clips of Obama and Hillary saying we need a wall.
[53:13.000 --> 53:18.000]  I mean Facebook blocks that. I mean that's that's come on folks. Come on.
[53:18.000 --> 53:26.000]  Well it's absolutely in your face. I mean yesterday a bunch of websites got dinged for fake news for covering the impeachment fiasco which is boring.
[53:26.000 --> 53:31.000]  I mean it's honestly one of the most boring things you could cover because it's so predictable. We all know what they're going to do.
[53:31.000 --> 53:40.000]  But as everybody knows Schiff essentially admitted that the witness from yesterday did speak to the Sierra Mela whistleblower.
[53:40.000 --> 53:49.000]  And I don't know the whistleblower. Exactly. And Facebook says that if you speculate if you say huh what does that mean.
[53:49.000 --> 53:56.000]  Then you are committing the cardinal sin of fake news and you'll be kicked off the platform which is why a national file.
[53:56.000 --> 54:03.000]  It's true everything we can. And I really appreciate your support to not be entirely dependent on social media.
[54:03.000 --> 54:06.000]  And of course I can't give those secrets away because then they'll be stolen from us.
[54:06.000 --> 54:12.000]  But articles like this are why they don't want us to be on these platforms.
[54:12.000 --> 54:17.000]  I mean we have the ex-girlfriend who we spent a solid week vetting.
[54:17.000 --> 54:23.000]  We've talked to her lawyers. We've done extensive research on every single person she mentioned in the hour long interview.
[54:23.000 --> 54:33.000]  And it is all completely rock solid. This woman has been in her motion text messages and videos and audio. I mean she hasn't.
[54:33.000 --> 54:41.000]  Right. I mean going back years years and years of photos with her children growing up in the presence of Paul Pelosi Jr.
[54:41.000 --> 54:46.000]  Who they referred to as daddy. That is before Paul Pelosi Jr.
[54:46.000 --> 54:56.000]  And I'm excited allegedly that he got everything he could from this woman through her under the bus allegedly stole her big beautiful apartment building from her.
[54:56.000 --> 55:02.000]  Stole it out from under his allegedly growing marijuana in the basement. I mean it's as insane as it could possibly be.
[55:02.000 --> 55:09.000]  And you sit there and you think this can't be real. And then I'm sitting there and I'm looking at the photos that Patrick Howley got a national file.
[55:09.000 --> 55:19.000]  And I'm like this is him. You can see him in the videos. You can see him when he's going and he's talking about his his new energy company and he was using clips of his mom.
[55:19.000 --> 55:27.000]  One of the biggest bombshells in this entire thing. And it's just bombshell after bombshell after bombshell. I highly recommend everybody read the article.
[55:27.000 --> 55:36.000]  It shows you what the sociopathic psychopathic monsters are like and the way they operated and what they do and what they do to people around them.
[55:36.000 --> 55:47.000]  Well in the way they grift. So one of the biggest bombshells is Paul Pelosi allegedly what he will do is he sets up these shell companies that never are designed to actually make a product.
[55:47.000 --> 55:56.000]  They're never designed to succeed. They're designed to take money from gullible people. So he'll call someone on the phone and say hi allegedly. This is what happens.
[55:56.000 --> 56:07.000]  Hi I'm Paul Pelosi and this is my mom's office calling you know Nancy Pelosi. She's the speaker of the house and we have an investment opportunity for you.
[56:07.000 --> 56:16.000]  So please give me a million dollars and you too can be involved in a Ukrainian oil company. And so then the gullible people do it. They give him money.
[56:16.000 --> 56:22.000]  This is what the ex-girlfriend says she saw over the course of years and years and years. It never ends.
[56:22.000 --> 56:34.000]  And so this is way more flagrant than anything that we've heard before. We did the bombshell piece a couple months ago or just last month I think it was where we exposed that Paul Pelosi had big ties to a company that did business
[56:34.000 --> 56:43.000]  in Ukraine just like Joe Biden did with Hunter Biden. So as you said Alex this is kind of a window into the world of the elite. They use people.
[56:43.000 --> 56:56.000]  They beat people. There's one account. She says that while Paul Pelosi was reportedly taking the oven out of her apartment stealing it from her essentially ripping out her kitchen.
[56:56.000 --> 57:07.000]  He enlisted the help of a homeless man. This homeless man was then crushed under the oven and Paul Pelosi sat there and did nothing and she's screaming you help him help him he's going to die.
[57:07.000 --> 57:16.000]  The man says I'm going to get my head split open. This is going to kill me. And Pelosi reportedly says so what. This is the callous nature of these people.
[57:16.000 --> 57:26.000]  They don't view and that's why they like the drugged out zombies all around them. This makes them feel good to see people in piles of feces. You have to understand folks they just gleefully they fly around in helicopters.
[57:26.000 --> 57:40.000]  How to be ripping a stove out they want everything they love the act of stealing dominating humiliating because that's what they are literal demons. And you've got all the audio all the video the text messages and then what he did to this woman taking
[57:40.000 --> 57:48.000]  your kids away putting them in foster care and saying in the text messages I'm going to do this to you. This is what this monster does.
[57:48.000 --> 57:59.000]  I spend a lot of time reminding the info wars family of listeners and viewers that without you won't be on the air and I spent a lot of time thanking you.
[57:59.000 --> 58:14.000]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reviewers but something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[58:14.000 --> 58:28.000]  You've got that pledge from me but you've seen the third party test out there the air filtration the water filtration the supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there and you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist.
[58:28.000 --> 58:44.000]  This hard so it's not a burden to support info wars. It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and make your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.
[58:44.000 --> 58:59.000]  Thank you so much.
[58:59.000 --> 59:17.000]  I could see where the globalists were going I could see what their in game agenda was what their goal was and I knew that when they were setting a sub to be deplatformed that they were really setting the pressure to take everybody off air to silence everyone to ban words and
[59:17.000 --> 59:30.000]  names and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed. But the globalist really feared was independent media and platforms in the future.
[59:30.000 --> 59:41.000]  It was the model of info wars as much as the information that had to be silenced because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed.
[59:41.000 --> 59:51.000]  That's why keeping info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever.
[59:51.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  It's a raging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  You're going to be back in the third hour and I'm going to play a few of these clips now but again making her get an abortion reportedly denying he knew her when he's in all these photos and text messages and then and then what he did to her.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  I mean this is so abusive and this is how these people treat women children they can get power over but they're always on the news how much they love women how much they love children but Hillary Clinton chose to represent brutal child rapist out of college as a lawyer.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  I mean it's the same MO over and over again.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  Well that's right. I mean it's really sickening to listen to this woman's account. I mean her children were yes ripped from her putting child putting foster care where they were reportedly abused because again we have the text message that comes from Paul Pelosi at least it seems that way.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  I mean maybe we can't say that 100% but the text message appears to come from him. The number that is in this text message is actually in the lawsuit that she filed against him and he is apparently allegedly saying if you don't do what I want then I'm going to call CPS and they're going to take your children away.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  That's exactly what happened last year. She gets about six hours of FaceTime with her children every 27 days. At one point one of her children went missing and again you can see the images on NationalFile.com.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  I know you've been putting them on screen for TV viewers at home Alex. You can see a man who certainly appears to be Paul Pelosi Jr. with these kids. They called him daddy according to this woman.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  I mean I've looked up his photos. It's him and I'm so wow and you guys get into all of it. The younger child may be his. Tell folks what she's saying, what she's reporting that this person that looks like him and has the phone number says he's him.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  Maybe it's an imposter, a Nigerian scam of some type, a white Nigerian but seriously where he reportedly made her get the abortion because he wanted the next baby to be his.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  So apparently this is what this nice young lady Kirina thing says. She says that she he Paul Pelosi Jr. She claims that he is obsessed with her genetics that he thinks that she is pure and beautiful and wonderful. And so for years he was essentially according to her
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  stalking this poor woman and eventually managed to get himself inserted into her lifestyle in her life but she was pregnant at the time so he forced her under threat of violence is what she says to get an abortion to abort her
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  unborn child when she was five months pregnant so he could have the next child with her but she also I mean this is this is the beautiful irony of these sick freaks Alex she says that he she tells us in the hour long interview you could find a national file
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  com she claims that he has erectile dysfunction so he may have never been able to create the child of his dreams with Tom you're taking over next hour thank you let's go to the clip six Pelosi forced abortion here it is
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  Nancy Pelosi actually knew that her son was trying to force you to have an abortion is that right.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  Yes the very next day Paul Pelosi. Well the reason why I had an abortion in. So it started because Paul Pelosi Jr. said he wanted me to have his child and no one else is and Paul Pelosi Jr. has been mad at me for having three children already.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  However this time he caught me while being pregnant so he must stop my pregnancy before I have another child that does not belong to him. So I try to tell his mother about what Paul Pelosi Jr. forced me to do.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  And right after my abortion his mother declared on her website right away that she was pro abortion so I gave up right then and there.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  Did Nancy Pelosi acknowledge your you when you tried to reach out to her did you try to reach out to her to tell her about this.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  I did not reach out to her because as soon as I reached out I saw the declaration on a website about pro abortion. So I just gave up I understood.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  I knew her and I understood what she was trying to do. So I just backed off because that would be her usual functions. If she was trying to answer someone she would just do it that way.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  All right folks you think this is bad. We're going to get into the really hardcore stuff straight ahead.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  Major report out of major university researchers working on food based treatment to slow aging science daily probiotics in the gut of a particular type cause your entire body to be healthier and make you live longer and make you not get intestinal cancer.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  We have the very best formula literally with what they even mentioned in the studies and it explains the hormone called FGF 21 pro longevity heals the entire body and actually reverses aging but is only made in the lower intestine.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  Oh and what does it say it's fiber from a spectrum of certain types of berries that grows this. And yes this is a plug gut fusion. And what do we have in this high auric berry blend strawberry blueberry blackberry cranberry escobalio grape and pomegranate.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  It's the pulp from them that then grows this gut fusion for children for young people for old people for everybody. This is fiber and glutamine. You're not going to find a better formula.
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  It's a good solution. It's amazing. In four store.com.
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:10.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  The whole house of cards is coming down in a big, big way. Now there's a report up on info wars dot com from Kellan McBrain and it links to a true pundit report that lists the FBI agent that was investigating this and mysteriously died listed others who are investigating this and mysteriously died.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  When you listen to the interview with a confirmed investigator the FBI hired a few years ago to do this investigating the Epstein case or the FBI. It's just chilling.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  Then the individual did go in report this directly to the FBI they opened an investigation and the FBI agent heading up the investigation died we have the name all the info we've pulled it up it's confirmed.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:32.000]  This is exactly what's been reported to me, not just by Kathy O'Brien, but others and researching the type of rituals these groups do this is exactly what they do.
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  And then you add people being killed in and around this.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  And all these state senators and people that have been investigating things like this getting killed. It's just incredible. We know they're doing this.
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  We know Epstein was doing this you know this whole thing with the Prince and the Queen's son and how it's a 17 year old girl and he's lying about it. They know their stuff a lot worse.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  So they've chosen to focus in on that that's why he's doing interviews. That's why he's looking guilty because it diverts everything off to a 17 year old woman who was a sex life and recruited when she was 14.
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  And obviously he did it. It's true and we know it. They have all the evidence. But that's the tip of the iceberg is the girls that look 20 but they're 15.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  Then they go oh you're corrupted. That's how they corrupt the government people. That's how they corrupt the scientific establishment to get them under their control.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  This is a Ponzi scheme.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  And now the whole thing is coming down. Now this is a 30 minute interview and I have real trouble listening to it.
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  Because it's real.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  And it fits into what Ted Gunnerson laid out and so much more in the finders and how they would cut the children's feet to get the blood and the rituals because they didn't want you to see the cuts.
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  And the exact type of things that they were up to. And again we know this case was opened up. We know the FBI agent over it did die.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  We know in the early stages of the investigation they used other investigators because they were having to hide it from the rest of the bureau because there's deep status in there and they get green lit from Trump which has happened.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  That's the good thing Trump's been doing is going after the perverts. He's not into this going after the Satanist perverts is too kind of a name.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  But before I get to this let's go ahead and play a senator and a congressman.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  Come out and talk about the American people not buying the official story of Epstein and nothing hurting confidence in the system like it as I've been telling you for months.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  Nothing.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  I thought it was the zeitgeist six months ago when he was arrested again.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  And then I thought it was huge when he died. Now this has got leftist coming up to me and apologizing all over Austin.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  Other cities I go to. People walk up with tears in their eyes when I'm at the shopping center or I'm in a restaurant.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  They go I thought you were full but I thought you were fake news. And I thought Hillary was good.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  I mean this is happening. Old women young women old men.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  I mean people now get it because they all heard me attacked in the news for claiming Epstein had an island and child sex and Bill Clinton.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  I didn't make any of this up. The Clintons kill people. You think I just want to make stuff up to mafia.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  I've got to do this because I've been put in this position by God.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  That mean I'm some special person but I'm willing to do it.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  And that's why I'm here.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  And I have to do this.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  And you have to do this too. It's not fun to expose this. Nobody wants to sit there and dwell on this.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  But you know what this is going on on a mass scale because here's the thing about a Ponzi scheme.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  You start with a small group. You corrupt the next group. The next group. It's called a corruption Ponzi scheme where they get you in on the corruption.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  And then now the pyramid has gotten massive and they've got so many people involved.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  State police and FBI confirmed 3,000 Catholic priests in Pennsylvania alone were involved in abuse of little boys mainly.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  Most of them reported that it was satanic rituals. This is mainstream news.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  The deputy pope, the pope's right-hand man just got convicted of trafficking hundreds of little boys and raping them.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  Some of them ended up dead. That was barely even in the news, folks.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  The pope's right-hand man, the guy he has investigating it, it turns out, has been implicated.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  And you're like, are there this many pedophiles? No. They have a network and they take over.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  And they go to other people that just want money and power and they say, you got to have sex with a 15-year-old girl.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  You and your wife got to do it. And a lot of times just the wives are like, let's get in there. I want this $10 million.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  People in key positions, banking, academia, science, and the husband will do it and they'll do it.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  And a month later, it's like, all right, now you're going to have sex with an eight-year-old.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  And then if you get in a bigger position of power, they go, this kid's been giving us trouble.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  We want you to go into this basement and beat this five-year-old to death with a baseball bat.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  And if you don't do it, we're going to kill you.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  See, the people think they're silent for power.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  At the end, they get money. It's paid right back to the globalists.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  You get nothing but slavery.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  Most people, husband and wife, are going with baseball bats.
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  The old kid's begging. They just start beating their brains out.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  When what you do is the guy doing it, you go, yeah, let me have that baseball bat and you beat their brains out.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  And then you get their address book.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  And then you do what you do to them, don't you?
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  You want to see savage power?
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  They're going to get it soon, don't worry, because God is vengeance.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  And you can feel the vengeance coming down.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  Like Sunday morning.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  So, let's start with this sickening first 10 minutes of the interview.
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  Here it is.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  Just so we're on the same page and just know, what I plan on doing is,
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  I'm going to contact the FBI, right?
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  If I can't find anybody worth a shit in the FBI,
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  I'm going to try something in Homeland Security to come and talk to you.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  And you enter them, I'm going to work on this video.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  The parts that I like, I'm going to cut up and put in a one area, right?
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  And then if they don't do anything with the story with you,
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  I'm going to do a story on it.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  I said, we're not going to do anything right away,
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  because I want to give these guys an opportunity to talk to you.
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  And if they talk to you, that's a story too, that they're talking to you,
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  and this is what happened to you.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  If they're not talking to you, then that's a story as well.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  They're not talking to you, but this is what happened to you.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  But I just want you to know that when we do a story or have your name and everything,
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  I'm not interested in doing something any other way when it comes to this,
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  because I think that this is the best way for you to start putting blocks back on top of this.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  And if I can help you anyway, I will.
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  I don't know how I can help you, or if I can do anything for you,
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  I'm happy to try to help.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  Before I was taken up to the top of the boat,
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  I was in a cabin on the other side of the boat being prostituted by my great uncle.
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  And I was left to believe that there were several other young boys in the adjacent rooms
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  that were going to be taken to the top of the boat one at a time, starting with me.
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  How old are you?
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  Eight years old.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  So you were eight years old and all this stuff.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  When you first got on the, this is like a yacht situation.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  Yeah, it's like a luxury cruise ship.
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  When you first get on the ship, what do you think is going to happen?
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  You don't know?
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  I was just not aware.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  It started this activity in my life when I was three or four years old, if not earlier.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  So I just didn't question where I was or what had happened to me at any of these times.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  All right, folks, we're going to go to break.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  We're going to come back.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  And we're going to get into satanic rituals with little boys and girls
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  and Bill Clinton drinking their blood.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  As seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  This is a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  Don't miss this one, stake your claim today. Call 800-600-3388. That's 800-600-3388.
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long. Call now 800-600-3388.
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  800-600-3388.
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  800-600-3388.
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  There's a famous quote by Marine Corps General in the Korean War when 3 million Chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the Marines.
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  More than 50 to 1 some estimates have it.
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  The point is they were outnumbered and the general was told, General, we're completely surrounded. He said, good, we can attack in all directions.
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  Well, that's the point that Info Wars has reached and it really is epic. It really is biblical and we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support.
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  But it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete. And it's not just Americans, but folks all over the world are completely silenced.
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  When it comes to speaking the name of a CIA fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile or speaking out against dangerous vaccines.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  Because by Info Wars having its own platform, that checkmate's the globalist.
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  Beto O'Rourke came out dozens of times and said, we're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles.
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  And he got all the other Democrats on the stage, nine others, to agree and said that he was a hero. Think about that.
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  Now those Democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  Their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime.
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  They know what they're doing. And now the Supreme Court's come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms.
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  My goodness, ladies and gentlemen, this country is under such incredible attack, but more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment.
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  And they're going to follow the original Bill of Rights and Constitution and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns.
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  So you see, a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens. Well, we can ignore all your unconstitutional laws.
[1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  Mike Moore heads up to the pundit that put the story out and he worked for the FBI for many years in forensic investigations.
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  And this is a real FBI group that they hired to investigate.
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:51.000]  I looked it up. The FBI agent that was on the case did mysteriously die. What was it a year ago? And then the original tape of the first interview came out.
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  Now, people consider that an attack true pundit, you know, because they've been under a lot of heat and a lot of demonization.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  And I think that's reasonable to investigate who's putting this stuff out. But this information is very credible to me from my research.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  And we know it's what the Clintons are mixed up in.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  I mean, I'm not going to recount all that again because there's some time that it makes my head spin.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  The Ed Buck thing and the reports of the Egyptian human sacrifice parties and the people telling folks about this don't know what it was.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  Or like, yeah, they're wearing Egyptian stuff. They're simulating murdering a black man and then black men, three of them have died in the house.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  And Adam Schiff's wearing an Egyptian outfit. These are real diaries. The police have. This is, you know, coming out.
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:42.000]  Nobody says, oh, that's an Alistair Crowley ritual. Here's the type. That's what it is.
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  So that's the type of crazy stuff going on. And that's why true pundit keeps getting the stuff because he worked for the FBI for a long time.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  But what goes on in these rituals and what's described here is what has been confirmed, what's come out with the finder's case and others that have been documented.
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  And again, take the 3000 priests admitting to a grand jury task force of a whole group of grand juries that they were running rituals, raping little boys in the Catholic Church at night on Saturday nights,
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  killing some of them, drinking their blood. I mean, it just gets worse and worse. They get you. It's a black hole. They start you out here with underage and then it just goes down to killing little kids.
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  That's the basis of it. You notice it's all coming out.
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  And notice they recruit women saying your genetics are incredible. You're the best. I want you to have children for me.
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  That's what's coming out with Pelosi's son and this woman. She doesn't even know what's going on. She's like, it's weird. He wanted a baby.
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  He said I had, he wanted to, it's the same deal. It's a cult. Okay.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  And I used to hear this again from Ted Gunderson and high level FBI agents 25 years ago and I couldn't believe it.
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  And it turned out everything Gunderson said was true. And three weeks ago they declassified thousands of pages of finders and I was reading it.
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  I stayed up two days, hours every night trying to finish it. I only read through like half of it. Thousands of pages.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  I had thousands of pages printed up.
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  And it gave me a headache because I was remembering everything Gunderson was saying and it was, they took over this town. They had this and they were doing that.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  And you're like, this is crazy. The Satanists aren't this powerful.
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  And then I'm reading stuff. This guy's been dead eight, nine years and I'm reading stuff. He was telling me, well, this is classified, but I don't care.
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  I'm going to say it. And I'm like reading. I was crying remembering Gunderson and I don't even have the crew, they're a great crew to go find all the interviews.
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  They did with him where he said all that and then match it up with the declassified stuff. FBI files that weren't even his reports all over the country.
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  Satanists taking over whole towns.
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  I said, I dare this tape. Just go back to it. Go back to it. This is a reported victim. One of the pre FBI interviews. Here it is.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  That situation. Yeah, it's like a luxury cruise ship.
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  When you first get on the ship, what do you think is going to happen? You don't know?
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  I was just not aware. It started this activity in my life when I was three or four years old, if not earlier.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  So I just didn't question where I was or what had happened to me these times.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  Let's go back to what you said about being prostituted. What happened?
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  I was put in the room and for most of the time that I was in the room, my great uncle was standing outside the door, taking people's money and letting them in.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  And then when he left, his cousin was left with me.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  I'm not sure if his cousin was alone outside the door at any point, but he was left alone with me on one of the lower decks of the boat.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  My uncle went to the top.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  So people would just come in and say, you're eight years old, so take advantage of me? What happens?
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  It's hard to talk about.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  Well, there were two beds in the room and I remember being on one of them at first.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  And then I remember a couple of, I remember at least three of the people who came in the room.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  And the last person that come in the room and the people who came in beforehand, it was, like, you, it's like...
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  You were raped.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  You were raped.
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  These are men coming in?
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  Yeah.
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  And at some point, all this happened on one yacht trip where there were subsequent yacht trips?
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  This was this one.
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  This was one event.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  Okay.
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  So then at some point you are essentially assaulted by Bill Clinton?
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  Mm-hmm.
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  Boy, what happens with that?
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  Well, there's a whole sequence of events leading up to when I was raped by him.
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  Okay, so just feel comfortable to just talk.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  If you want to lead up to it, that's fine.
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  Well, there is an incredibly violent display going on and I don't want to talk too much about that.
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  But before I was raped by Bill Clinton, my uncle held me up over his head and his accomplice p*** walked up and slashed across the bottom of my feet with a scimitar
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  and collected the blood in a chalice dish with us.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  He took a sip from it and then walked away through the crowd.
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  After my uncle got bored or whatever, he held me up and tried to get Bill Clinton's attention.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  Bill Clinton turned around and looked like he gave us a look like,
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  what am I going to do?
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  I have to do it.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  Yeah, well, that's not true.
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  This is the top deck of the book.
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  How many other kids you're age or on it?
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  I only saw two other kids my age and they were in different circumstances.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  Meaning they weren't in as much danger or they were in more danger or equal danger?
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  On top of the top, the only other child was a young girl on birth bait.
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  I remember there being a young girl on one of the four podiums, her four podiums like this.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to go to break and come back.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  I'm going to play a little bit more of this than I need to shift gears into all the other news.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  And I haven't even gotten the clips of the senators and others admitting that the whole cover-ups collapsing,
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  that America is outraged at government and that they know the government's involved with that scene.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  It's coming down.
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:28:57.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:01.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  I can help you too.
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:17.000]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:43.000]  Call 834 no tax or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:53.000]  That's 866-295-5305, hpextract.com.
[1:29:53.000 --> 1:29:57.000]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[1:29:57.000 --> 1:30:06.000]  I spend a lot of time reminding the info wars of family of listeners and viewers that without you we won't be on the air.
[1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:13.000]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better
[1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:16.000]  and raising the alarm as modern ball reveres.
[1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:23.000]  Something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  You've got that pledge from me but you've seen the third-party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration.
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:42.000]  So it's not a burden to support info wars.
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:48.000]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom
[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:55.000]  So visit infowarstore.com today.
[1:30:58.000 --> 1:31:01.000]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson.
[1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to?
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:11.000]  How far will they go? What's their limit?
[1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:18.000]  And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  The answer is there is no limit to evil. It is a bottomless pit.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:30.000]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist.
[1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:33.000]  Or that there's no free will. There's no devil or the God.
[1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:43.000]  But those very Saint people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like.
[1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:47.000]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us.
[1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  Oxford's banned clapping.
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:53.000]  University of the U.S. have banned 21 gun salutes for veterans.
[1:31:53.000 --> 1:31:56.000]  These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[1:31:56.000 --> 1:32:04.000]  Infowarstore.com. We have a new product and we got several thousand of these in and they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them.
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:09.000]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it but this really is a game changing toothpaste.
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:15.000]  And it doesn't compete with super blue that's four to five of colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride free.
[1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:17.000]  The adult or the children's.
[1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:22.000]  These are both excellent toothpaste, concentrates that don't have fillers. People love it.
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:31.000]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans but also re mineralizes the teeth.
[1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:37.000]  Then it has the patented silver salt, silver in it to knock out the bacteria that causes gensivitis.
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:39.000]  This is all proven. You can make claims with this.
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  But I had to tell you no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:54.000]  So we're really proud of it. It funds the operation in full or store.com.
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:33:22.000]  That's why we're still on air. Thanks to you.
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:24.000]  Okay.
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  In about 25, 30 minutes, I'm going to get in my car and I'm going to drive up to North Austin where President Trump is going to be at the Apple contractor facility.
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  And the crew gave me the address but it's been buried here in my stack.
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  We'll put it up on screen for folks before I leave.
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  And there's a bunch of leftist up there protesting Trump for all the wrong reasons.
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  I'm going to be up there delivering a message to the president that I'd really like to see him take action when it comes to the censorship of the Internet and what's happening.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  Again, Facebook admits that they banned people posting previous clips of Obama and Hillary saying we need a border wall and that people shouldn't be able to come here illegally and get benefits.
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  Now, that's an info wars.com article. It's in mainstream news as well.
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  Facebook is proud of what they've done.
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  They said we've taken this down to fact check it.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  And then they got fact checked and yeah, it's Obama and Hillary.
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  We've all played those clips probably 200 times here since the 2016 election.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  He ended up probably for about four and a half years.
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  You want to play him again? Let's see that's so powerful to say Trump's a Nazi needs to go to prison.
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  He's the worst person on earth because he believes we should have borders.
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  Think about that.
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  And then you can show the exact same things he's saying.
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  By the way, he set his policy according to US policy and US law and what the border patrol advised him on, which is what Hillary and Obama had before as the policy.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  Because if you tried to say no borders, no country at all, no one would go along with that.
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  So it's so powerful to show that Trump's done nothing except his job that they won't allow that.
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  Now that's history, their memory holding to use the term from 1984.
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  Or it's Winston Smith's job to go back and clip through the microfilm, the microfish, and find things where the government had said one thing a year before, two years before, six months before, sometimes a day before,
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  that was contradictory to what they're saying now.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  We've never been at war with East Asia.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  Day later, we've always been at war with East Asia.
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  And if you said the next day, hey, they just said last week we were never at war with East Asia.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  Now they're saying we're always at war.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  They kill you.
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  Because everything's an open air force labor camp.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  That's always the leftist utopia once.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  Oh, you're trying to job.
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  It's an honor to work for free for the system.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  A lot of the elites have helicopters and caviar and they can have five kids, but we can't.
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  Oh, you're dead.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  But first, we're going to torture you until you give us your soul.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  George Arwell, folks, I'm not going to go into George Arwell's appeal.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  His real name Eric Blair, part of an elite family of aristocratic brain trust in England.
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  I've read all his essays.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  This is the Fabian society till he resigned from it.
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  That's the head group.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  And when they finally let him into the Satanist group, he said, I'm not into stomping on the human face forever.
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  And they said, listen, Winston, Mr. Blair, Mr. Orwell, we want to trample and be trampled upon.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  We want to destroy humanity and bring it down.
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  We're here to destroy the species.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  I'm not in the club anymore.
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  And he died one year after it was published.
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  He was living and hiding, by the way, by then.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  He was so freaked out when they went, by the way, we're not really communists that went and power everybody.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  We're devil worshipers.
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  Because he had been a secret police officer in India.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  He then fought for the communist against Hitler in the Spanish Civil War.
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  War hero got shot through the throat and everything.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  Then he'd worked as one of the top propagandists at BBC during World War II and was the head of the Fabian society.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  Until they went, by the way, you're just a public head.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  Here's the real group.
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  And as we went, whoa, we don't want to empower humanity.
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  We're not killing people and lying for a greater good.
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  We're doing it to hurt people.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  And they said, yep.
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  So, remember that.
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  That Facebook now, four months ago, you can't see Alex Jones' name unless it's negative.
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  And now you can't show clips of Obama or Hillary saying, build a wall, build a border or arrest people that are here illegally.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  And that's why I'm protesting Trump.
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  Enough is enough.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  That isn't them censoring what they want as a private company.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  That's panopticonic AI control saying you can't share Hong Kong or Taiwan or the Vietnam flags.
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  Because China does, and you can't share Winnie the Pooh.
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  It's pre-control.
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  Imagine if the Chai comms said we don't want the letter X or the letter A in your alphabet.
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  Would Apple remove a letter out of the alphabet?
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  It's destroying language.
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  It's cult-like.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  It's authoritarian.
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  It's dangerous.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  And Trump is enamored with Tim Cook because of Ivanka and Jared Kushner.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  And I'm not going to sit here and put up with this crap.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  You know, I'm not going to play any more of the hour-long interview with this poor young man.
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  It's up on itforwars.com.
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  If you want to go see it, I can't listen any more of it.
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  But it gets a lot worse.
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  But they're cutting little girls up and all this stuff.
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  And it's disgusting.
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  I mean, you have to understand that I've actually researched this because I ran into this when I was a teenager.
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  And I didn't know that we'd moved to a town that had been taken over by it.
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  What do you think was the richest county in Texas when I lived there?
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  And that's wherever the money is, is where you're going to find this stuff.
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  And I never took part in rituals.
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  But I got fooled into going to them twice and got out.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  And had to kick some ass one time.
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  And, you know, they didn't want me to dittle me and stuff.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  They wanted me on the dark side to be a operative.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  And thank God, thank God, I didn't get caught up in it.
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  Because I was taking a liking to the outer rings of it.
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  I mean, I like to get in fights and I like to, you know, sex in all nine yards.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  And just thank God I didn't get picked up and become a channeler for those people to empower them.
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  Because that's really what they want.
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  And now this engine is dedicated to taking them down.
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:09.000]  And you've got that same spiritual engine and you need to turn it over to God and let God work through you.
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  And we're going to crush these people together.
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  All right, I'm going to stop talking about this at this point.
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  I have a few clips from Congress I want to play just showing how this is breaking.
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  These senators and House members did like 10-minute speeches.
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  That's their opening remarks as leaders on the committees about how the system's lost credit.
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  It's collapsing. Everybody knows the government's covering up the pedophilia.
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  I mean, here's just some of it.
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  GOP Senator Kennedy says he doesn't believe Epstein killed himself. Here it is.
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  Christmas ornaments, drywall and jury Epstein.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  Name three things that don't hang themselves.
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  That's what the American people think.
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  That's what the American people think.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  And they deserve some answers.
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  And I know that you're not in charge of these investigations.
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  Yes, sir.
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  But you talk to the people who are.
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  And I need you to take a very respectful message today.
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  Tell the American people what happened.
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  And don't rush it so that they don't do a thorough investigation.
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  But you and I both know they can make this a top priority and get it done more quickly than they normally would.
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  They need to do that.
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  And I'd like you to deliver that message.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  I agree with you, sir, but I have no control.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  I mean, I can pass along the message, but the FBI and the Inspector General's office work on their own timeframe.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  But I will definitely give you their message because I want the investigations completed as soon as possible, too, so that we can act.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  I have a feeling you know how to be firm.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  And then he goes into the fact because they're not buying any of it and they're pissed.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  It's powerful. Stay with us.
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  There's a famous quote by Marine Corps General in the Korean War when 3 million Chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the Marines.
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  More than 50 to 1, some estimates have it.
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:16.000]  But the point is they were outnumbered and the General was told, General, we're completely surrounded.
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:20.000]  He said, good, we can attack in all directions.
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  Well, that's the point that Info Wars has reached.
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  And it really is epic.
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  It really is biblical.
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  And we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support.
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:36.000]  But it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete.
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:40.000]  And it's not just Americans, but folks all over the world are completely silenced.
[1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:49.000]  When it comes to speaking the name of a CIA fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile or speaking out against dangerous vaccines.
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  Because by Info Wars having its own platform, that checkmates the globalists.
[1:43:57.000 --> 1:44:00.000]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true.
[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  But I'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball.
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  I could see where the globalists were going.
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:12.000]  I could see what their in-game agenda was, what their goal was.
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  And I knew that when they were setting us up to be deplatformed that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody off air,
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  to silence everyone, to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers.
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:30.000]  So that their false narratives couldn't be opposed.
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  What the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future.
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  It was the model of Info Wars as much as the information that had to be silenced.
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  Because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed.
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:57.000]  And that's why keeping Info Wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever.
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:45:01.000]  Beto Rourke came out dozens of times and said,
[1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  we're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles.
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  And he got all the other Democrats on the stage, nine others, to agree and said that he was a hero.
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:11.000]  Think about that.
[1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:15.000]  Now those Democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control.
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  Their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime.
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  They know what they're doing.
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  And now the Supreme Court's come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms.
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  My goodness, ladies and gentlemen, this country is under such incredible attack.
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  But more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment.
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  And they're going to follow the original Bill of Rights and Constitution and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns.
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  So you see, a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens.
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  Well, we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws.
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:46:04.000]  Major report out of major university researchers working on food-based treatment to slow aging science daily.
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:11.000]  Probiotics in the gut of a particular type cause your entire body to be healthier and make you live longer and make you not get intestinal cancer.
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:15.000]  We have the very best formula, literally, with what they even mentioned in the studies.
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:27.000]  And it explains that the hormone called FGF21, pro longevity, heals the entire body and actually reverses aging but is only made in the lower intestine.
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:28.000]  Oh, and what does it say?
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  It's fiber from a spectrum of certain types of berries that grows this.
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:35.000]  And yes, this is a plug, gut fusion.
[1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  And what do we have in this high auric berry blend, strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, cranberry, escoblio, grape, and pomegranate?
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  It's the pulp from them that then grows this.
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:50.000]  Gut fusion for children, for young people, for old people, for everybody.
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:52.000]  This is fiber and glutamine.
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:54.000]  You're not going to find a better formula.
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:55.000]  Gut fusion, it's amazing.
[1:46:55.000 --> 1:47:07.000]  Infowars.com
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news today.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  You had some things to hide, should have hidden it, shouldn't you?
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  Now you're not satisfied.
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:42.000]  All right, I was talking to Mike Adams, who's hosting the fourth hour today.
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  NationalNews.com with a great mind, with a great asset for the human future.
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  But a warrior about what he was going to be covering, he said, have you seen these reports?
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  These are mainstream news reports, like it's a good thing.
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  Children in Colorado don't just have men dressed as women unannounced come to elementary schools in Colorado,
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  not just libraries, and have the children sit on their laps without the parents knowing
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  men dressed as women coming to have contact with their children, grooming.
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  They admit they're grooming.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  You want me to play the videos?
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  He said, have you seen this?
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  And I saw that before the show, and that made me go into more of a rage.
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  Talk about triggering, I literally just started screaming after I hung up the phone from talking to him this morning.
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  He's now written the article.
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  It's going up on infowars.com.
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  It's happening.
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  Colorado Public Schools now requiring students to role play child sacrifice poems as part of rape training indoctrination.
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  As you tell poems about children being sacrificed to MOLIC.
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  I played you a famous Italian silence film that was the impetus for Mussolini's party,
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  where they engage in mock humans child sacrifice of children.
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  And Mussolini wrote about it and talked about it and inspired Hitler, who was a Luciferian and followed the Theosophic society.
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  These people are unbelievable.
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  By the way, that's not something I just saw on my Discovery Channel or History Channel.
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  I got really obsessed with history and went through different chapters of history.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  And you know, I mean, let's probably read 30, 40 books on Rome.
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  You know, probably read 200 books on World War II, stuff like that.
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  The Nazis were devil worshipers.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  And it came out of this.
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  They weren't just druidic.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  They weren't just going back to European roots.
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  No, they were into the occult.
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  That's why they went and dug up the Middle East and tried to find all the sacred objects in the Ark of the Covenant.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  That's not just in movies like Raiders Lost Ark.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  That really was going on.
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  So now, look at this.
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  It's happening.
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  Colorado public schools now require students to role play child sacrifice poems as part of rape training and indoctrination.
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  I remember it was Colorado began in the late 90s under Clinton death education where they would roll kids up in blankets in rugs and then make them feel what it's like to die.
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  And then they saw massive increases in suicide.
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  They teach girls ages 11 and 12 how to put a string around their neck and how people kill themselves and say, don't do this.
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  You just tie it up on the little peg where you hang your coat in the bathroom in the stall and you lean forward and you pass out.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  You die and then a bunch of girls would go do it.
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  They knew exactly what they were doing.
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  You don't think South Dakota put out an ad saying meth, I'm on it.
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  Meth, we're on it on accident.
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  These people know what they're doing.
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  It's all a sick joke.
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  It's occultism because you have to tell people what you're doing openly from the top.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  It's called lesser magic.
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  They call that laying the cornerstone of a great work.
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  If they tell you what they're going to do beforehand with predicted programming, then they believe it'll be a successful mission.
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  Now, does the governor know that?
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  Obviously, these people don't know anything, but it's occultists behind them doing it all.
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  And once you realize that, it's all crystal clear.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  So this article goes on, the greatest challenge to covering the events actually taking place in our world is that most people don't recognize the level of depravity, perversion, and evil that has overtaken liberals and Democrats.
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  So they can't mentally grasp the reality of what's actually happening all around them because it's unthinkable.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  So when a 16-year-old Colorado girl was violated by sexually explicit role-playing assignment in school where she was required to play rape and sodomy concepts,
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  well, the teacher demanded that she read lines out of loud like F in the ASS and similar language.
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  Most people dismiss the reality because they can't fathom it.
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  That was actually in the major Colorado news yesterday. They defended it. Oh, it's good. It's good.
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  And again, that's creepy adults wanting to act out rape with your daughters and your sons getting off on it.
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  And there's so many good people that want to go into education to help children and lift up the next generation.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  But statistically, that's where the predators go. You've got to watch them and watch them closely. Hell, you see this stuff all the time.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  Now, is it pedophilia if you're 16 and the teacher's 25 and you have sex with her? No.
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  But it's still unethical abuse of bad. People say go to jail for that for a few years.
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  But you go after people under 15, under 14, you deserve to go to prison for life. You hurt them, you go to prison until we execute you.
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:59.000]  And that's the reality here, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  And they are corrupting our children. It's their religion. It's their plan.
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  Now, I want to get into a tax on free speech here. China threatens retaliation after U.S. Senate passes Hong Kong bill stocks young tumble.
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  And here's footage of the epic times who are just amazing patriots doing a great job.
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  Their publications, the blood of truth. I mean, it's it's like oxygen.
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  And here is video in Hong Kong of their facility set up by Hong Kong survivors.
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  The globalist tried to kill. And here come the Chai Kong military in plain clothes and they burn down their facility in Hong Kong.
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  That's courage.
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:55.000]  And that's what we're facing here in America if we let this go much longer.
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  These are mash men in front of the workers pouring gasoline on it and then setting it on fire.
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  And these guys do an excellent job. That's exactly how you don't want to put too much out.
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  You want to splash it out, you know, you know, get a pattern of it underway, you want to burn and then ignite it.
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  And then they leave and the workers go and stop it.
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  But that's the type of stuff the Chai comms their military rolled in openly.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  A few days ago, they were already there the whole time.
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  Now, let's talk about free speech. There's a zoomer clips put out a good meme.
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  We'll try to put on screen and color if we can.
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  For TV viewers, people who support free speech, real conservatives versus people who support the platforming and censorship fake conservatives.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  And you click and expand that for me. Thanks a lot.
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  People can see the full images.
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  And that's the folks that do not support free speech.
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  And then you can see the folks that do support free speech.
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  And again, the globalists are suing us, threatening us, attacking us, trying to shut us down.
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  Only you can keep us on air. Look at this article from NationalFileUponInFullWars.com.
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  Dan Crenshaw and right wing watches Jared Holt follow each other on Twitter.
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  Of course, they do. They're working together.
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  Dan Crenshaw is a total Trojan horse.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  It now supports the platforming of Michelle Malcolm, who's married to a Jew and is pro-Israel.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  She is now a Nazi because she supports free speech.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  No, Crenshaw, you're the person that's violated your oath, both in the military and in Congress, to protect and defend the Constitution.
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  You want to brown-nose the system and think you're going to get ahead.
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  Now, let's get some unintentional comedy here.
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  Does Beto realize he's actually supporting the border wall with that hat?
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  Borders are great. We need more borders.
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  He has a hat he's wearing everywhere.
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  I checked this. It's true. He did it saying the border makes America great.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  Yes, we know there's some great people that live on the U.S. side and the other side of the border.
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  There's also a failed sale on the other side of the border.
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  But the idea is there's a border there, buddy.
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  That means it's controlled like a door on your house or a screen on your window so you decide what comes in.
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  That's why we wear clothing. It's a border.
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  It's why our cells have a membrane and plant cells have a wall because that's how you partition things.
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  But it's as dumb as the meth we're on it thing.
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  The way these psychos like miss a lot of stuff.
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  They're cunning. They know how to manipulate. They know how to lie.
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  But it's like they're not alive. It's like they're missing the spark of getting jokes or getting the real meaning of things.
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  They don't have depth. They're machine-like. They're reptile-like.
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  By the way, speaking of that, David, I, the guy that does think reptiles secretly rule the Earth, hell, he might be a reptile.
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  This is going. They sure as hell act like him. He's on the show next week for two hours. Look forward to that.
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  They always told me the lizard guy. You're the guy that thinks the lizard's running.
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  I'm like, no, no. I'm not the guy that thinks that.
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  I just know that people running things really are devil worshipers and think they're bringing entities into them
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  and do horrible crimes they believe like a Dungeons and Dragons game to move up the demon they get.
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  Yeah. There's people that want to be possessed.
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  And not all these demons operate like Slimer or Linda Blair.
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  They behave like Hillary Clinton.
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  And, you know, just you need to know the aliens are walking amongst you folks. It's interdimensional.
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  They take over our bodies. Every culture knew it. It's real. It's real. It's a fact. The Bible's right.
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:45.000]  Your church won't tell you this stuff now, though. We'll be right back.
[1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:50.000]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up.
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:53.000]  I've said it many times. I will never give in.
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:56.000]  I will never give up, but I could give out.
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:58:02.000]  And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity.
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:10.000]  To see evil running rampant like this and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace.
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:15.000]  That most Americans have already been shadow banned by Big Tech.
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word about newswars.com, infowars.com, and banned on video.
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  And that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever.
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:37.000]  And that if you tell people, hey, the banned truth they don't want you to have is at infowars.com.com.
[1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:45.000]  So take heart, folks. They've had to censor everybody and shut everybody down because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:57.000]  About a month ago, President Trump announced that he was going to move his domicile from New York City to Florida, where he's always said he planned to retire to.
[1:58:57.000 --> 1:59:00.000]  And the left got so excited.
[1:59:00.000 --> 1:59:08.000]  They said, oh, he's about to resign and leave instead of facing impeachment and he's running to Florida.
[1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:13.000]  Well, now we know why the president did that. He knew the leftist controlled appeals courts.
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  We're going to say that he had to give up his tax returns so they can pour over them and harass every business partner he's got.
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  They want to terrorize people that he's worked with.
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:34.000]  And by moving his domicile from New York to Florida that gets around the New York law they passed to get his tax returns that are supposed to be private.
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:39.000]  So all those people out there holding their breath for the president to resign.
[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:55.000]  In his words, we're kicking the deep state's ass and he's never going to resign.
[1:59:55.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:26.000]  All right, Tom Papert's going to take over here in about 10 minutes. I'm going to get in my car and I'm going to drive to North Austin where Trump's going to be.
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  And the armored vehicle we did just purchase, we just ran into it a month ago in Dallas with the security up there and we got a good deal on it.
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:39.000]  That way we can grow into the Antifa. They can't get to us.
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  We can deploy a massive sound with the new powerful sound system we'll be debuting today with President Trump and a lot more.
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  So that is coming up. I'll tell you more about that and that's how we fund this operation.
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  We've got big plans with PR with the armored vehicle.
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, when I have an idea and I know that idea is going to succeed, if I take action with that idea,
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:19.000]  the idea has never failed thanks to God's discernment that I've been given and thanks to the fact that we are working together and building the resistance to this globalist satanic operation together.
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  So I didn't do this. We did this together and that's not patronization telling you how great you are.
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:39.000]  You need to know how important you are and how much I want to salute you and how much I want to thank you. And I was thinking last night how I could somehow show you how important you are.
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  I think a lot of you already realized that, but I am humbled by your prayer, your word of mouth and your financial support and I desperately don't want the globalists to win and I don't want them to snuff out in full wars.
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:02:01.000]  But listen, financially supporting us has never been easier. How do I telegraph to you that I'm not hyping up DNA Force Plus?
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  How many studies do I have to show you about CoQ10 and PQQ, especially when it's added with these other ingredients and what it's been proven to do to heart tissue and to brain tissue
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  and how it can regrow the mitochondria in brain tissue, PQQ and how we've got the best type of PQQ and how little crappy synthetic ones are 50 bucks a bottle just for one of the things that's in this.
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:39.000]  These are big old horse pills. How it cost tens of thousands of dollars a kilo for just the PQQ and thousands of dollars a kilos for the CoQ10 and how I literally had my finger chopped off and the feeling didn't come back until I started taking it six years ago
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  and within three months it tingled, the feeling came back and my finger has full feeling. We're allowed to say, even with the FDA tyrants, that PQQ regrows nerves.
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:57.000]  Now let me tell you, got an old injury that's numbed out? You may start hurting like hell about a month into this stuff, but a couple months into it, woo!
[2:02:57.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  I mean, this is powerful stuff God gave us and with all the attacks, this allows the mitochondria to grow back and pump the garbage out of the cells.
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  So people have been asking me, what the hell is going on? And it's a lot of things, prayer, getting closer to God and taking the supplements religiously.
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:23.000]  Now the problem is, my energy has grown and I'm praying God to just temper the focused rage at the globalist and I'm just going to put it into longer hours and harder work,
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  but God wants me to trigger you to take action as well. And a big way to do it is taking care of yourself and getting the DNA force at plus.
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  You need to get it at infowarstore.com. For a limited time, it's still going to be 50% off, double paid free points, free shipping.
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  We're going to run out of this by Christmas and then more comes in late January. I signed a contract to get twice as much.
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  I get a better deal on it and you're not going to find a quality formula, PQQ CoQ10 and the rest of the stuff that's in here anywhere, for anywhere close to this, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  So infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. You want game changing? DNA force plus.
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  We reformulated it and made it even stronger. When you change the formula, you have to change the name.
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  That's why our products and say plus means there's always more of it. It's better. That's what we do.
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  I treat you like I want to be treated. And it's not magic. Magic's the world's name for God's rules.
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:23.000]  It's the fact that I can't help but treat you like I want to be treated. And that's why I feel so guilty sometimes in things when I'm angry and mad and mean to the crew.
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  Because I'm just like radioactive. I'm so angry at the globalist. I don't feel good about dominating people and doing things like that and misdirecting and having friendly fire.
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:39.000]  I want to focus it all downrange and I can feel your prayer and your support and I can absolutely see the enemy's fear by what you've been doing.
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  Info Wars is not just the tip of the spear. It is a flaming sword of truth coming at the globalist and funding us as critical.
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  Plus, it's a product you need.
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:55.000]  DNA force plus at infowarstore.com.
[2:04:55.000 --> 2:05:04.000]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true, but I'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball.
[2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:11.000]  I could see where the globalists were going. I could see what their in-game agenda was, what their goal was.
[2:05:11.000 --> 2:05:29.000]  And I knew that when they were setting us up to be deplatformed that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody off air, to silence everyone, to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed.
[2:05:29.000 --> 2:05:35.000]  What the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future.
[2:05:35.000 --> 2:05:47.000]  It was the model of Info Wars as much as the information that had to be silenced because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed.
[2:05:47.000 --> 2:06:12.000]  And that's why keeping Info Wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever.
[2:06:12.000 --> 2:06:17.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[2:06:17.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:43.000]  Alright, I'm going to go up to the Apple Center up off Palmer Lane here in about 10 minutes. They're already starting to close roads off ahead of Trump who should be landing in about 45 minutes at Austin Burksford Airport.
[2:06:43.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  I want to be back on the war room today. He's getting his teeth worked on. Knocked the two top playing basketball. That guy's quite the athlete. And was it Rob Doe knocked it out? Rob Doe's quite the aggressive basketball player.
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  He got his scholarship for basketball. But that's a pointless factoid, isn't it?
[2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:16.000]  But we're going to be getting to all of it. And I'm going to be there bullhorning Trump and that little weasel, raccoon eyes of Tim Cook. Absolutely incredible. So that is all going to be streamed live.
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  We've already got live streams. And really, Alex Jones bullhorned Trump because, man, we need reinforcements.
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:31.000]  We don't need Trump parading around with the ringleader, a big tech that moved everything to China and is doing this. And I'm not against Trump, but we got Trump elected.
[2:07:31.000 --> 2:07:41.000]  And, you know, let's say we're like the kids that got Trump into office and we're like, hey dad, what are you doing with the guy that wants to put us in prison?
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:51.000]  Hey dad, what are you doing with him? You know, if you get him to do the right thing, that's good to meet with him. But if we haven't gotten relief and the censorship is getting worse for everybody now,
[2:07:51.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  then you need to do something. So I'll be up there, ladies and gentlemen, here in just a little while. We'll have live streams of that popping in during Mike Adams who does the fourth hour.
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:11.000]  But we have Tom Pepper and huge news coming up here in just a moment. This could bring down Pelosi and it could really bring down the Democratic Party.
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:24.000]  And they claim that, you know, Kavanaugh and people are like, with no evidence. So this is a lot of evidence. Somebody naming their name with photos, with text messages, with videos about Pelosi's son and Pelosi covering it up and everything else reportedly.
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:39.000]  So that's coming up just a moment. Now, speaking of weasels, this Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vidman is a deep state Obama-Clinton swamp creature of mole rat proportions.
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  And he is one of the quote whistleblowers. I always told you there's not one whistleblower. It'll be a bunch of low levels that will then say that they're the ones that heard it for Brennan and Hillary and others that ordered them to do this.
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:57.000]  And it's now come out exactly like I told you, exactly like Mike Adams told you. We just know how they operate. It's exactly as we told you.
[2:08:57.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  And yesterday, I'm not going to play all the clips. They're all over the news. There's still got live coverage going. I mean, what a waste of time once you expose just the fact that it's meant to be a waste of time and a diversion.
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:13.000]  He goes, oh, yeah, I can't tell you the whistleblower is because, you know, that's, but then I don't know who the whistleblower is, but you talk to the whistleblower.
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  This is the guy that tried to edit and change the transcript. So he lies to Congress. He gets caught lying to Congress.
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:30.000]  But the first thing I want to play by Mr. Mole Rat, who did, you know, almost a month of pre-secret hearings just to script all this.
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:45.000]  He's not a whistleblower. He's a mole, a globalist mole. This little, a feet arrogant thinks he's the master of the universe, joke, operative.
[2:09:45.000 --> 2:09:52.000]  The veterans are just recoiling. Everything the military hates. Some little corrupt disc jockey flying a desk around.
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:57.000]  I think it's folks that are in procurement things, but this guy's a political weasel.
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:10:04.000]  And he's like, you call me Lieutenant Colonel every time you have a new question. I am a king.
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:11.000]  So he is a arrogant little fob. Let's play that clip. Here it is.
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  Mr. Venman, are you testified in your deposition that you did not know the whistleblower?
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:19.000]  A ranking member at Lieutenant Colonel Venman, please.
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:29.000]  Lieutenant Colonel Venman, you testified in the deposition that you did not know who the whistleblower was.
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  I do not know who the whistleblower is.
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  How is it possible? You got to love all the titles these people have. This guy's a disgrace.
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  So here's some of the other clips I want to get to because there's so many of these.
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:52.000]  Here's an important clip. There's so many of these. I should have looked at these during the break.
[2:10:52.000 --> 2:10:56.000]  I watched these last night and again this morning. Let's go ahead and play.
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  Where's the one where Nunes catches him lying and saying the whistleblower in one testimony and now he says he doesn't know the whistleblower.
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:11.000]  He should be indicted for that. That was in my stack here. I should have looked at it during the break.
[2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:18.000]  While we look for that, let's go ahead and play another clip. Here it is. It's clip 12.
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:26.000]  Clip 12 on sheet 2. Let's go ahead and play a perjury. Nunes catches Venman contradicting closed door testimony.
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  Lieutenant Colonel Venman, did you discuss the July 25 phone call with anyone outside the White House on July 25th or the 26th?
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:37.000]  And if so, with whom?
[2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:43.000]  Yes, I did. My core function is to coordinate U.S. government policy, interagency policy.
[2:11:43.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  And I spoke to two individuals with regards to providing some sort of readout of the call.
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  Two individuals that were not in the White House?
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:12:01.000]  Not in the White House. Cleared U.S. government officials with appropriate need to know.
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:05.000]  And what agencies were these officials with?
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  The Department of State, Department of State Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent,
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  who is responsible for the portfolio Eastern Europe, including Ukraine,
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:23.000]  and an individual from the intelligence community.
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:32.000]  As you know, the intelligence community has 17 different agencies. What agency was this individual from?
[2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:37.000]  If I could interject here, we don't want to use these proceedings.
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  It's our time, but we need to protect the whistleblower.
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:51.000]  Please stop. I want to make sure that there's no effort to out the whistleblower through the use of these proceedings.
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  If the witness...
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:57.000]  Shift met with them. That all came out. It's a whole consortium of liars.
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:13:01.000]  None of them want to be put on the spot because they're all lying.
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:04.000]  Benjamin has testified in the transcripts that he did know the whistleblower was.
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:09.000]  He just said, I talked to people, one here, one there, one in intelligence.
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:13.000]  And then it's now, don't out the whistleblower. They're so unproven, not even good at lying,
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  that they're saying one of these is one of the supposed whistleblowers.
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:21.000]  And now he says he doesn't know who the whistleblower is, just like Shift's saying.
[2:13:21.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  I mean, the level of Keystone Cop, but that's who rules us, is a bunch of out-of-control crooks like Shift.
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:37.000]  So he said he knows who they are. Now he starts talking about the whistleblower.
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  Now he says he doesn't want to out the whistleblower, but he doesn't know who the whistleblower is.
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  Oh, I talked to the whistleblower, but I can't tell you who the whistleblower is because I don't know who the whistleblower is.
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  If you're old, stealing candy out of mommy's purse, lie better than this.
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:57.000]  But they don't need to be good at lying. They just have all the power because we put up with their crap.
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:13:59.000]  Let's continue.
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  If the witness has a good faith belief that this may reveal the identity of the whistleblower,
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  that is not the purpose that we are here for, and I want to advise the witness accordingly.
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:19.000]  Mr. Vynman, are you testified in your deposition that you did not know the whistleblower?
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  I remember at Lieutenant Colonel Vynman, please.
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:32.000]  Lieutenant Colonel Vynman, you testified in the deposition that you did not know who the whistleblower was.
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:35.000]  I do not know who the whistleblower is.
[2:14:35.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  How is it possible for you to name these people and then out the whistleblower?
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  In an earlier testimony, he's done it like what four times now,
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:54.000]  they said that he did know who the whistleblower was but wouldn't out the identity and that Trump shouldn't threaten him to release it.
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  Now he didn't know, then he did know, then he didn't know.
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  Meanwhile, Rodgerstone's facing 50 years in prison potentially for doing nothing.
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  But they claim lying to Congress.
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:07.000]  Tom Pappert, you are loaded for bear in 30 seconds.
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  Tell folks why this story is so important. I agree with you.
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:13.000]  Biggest story you've ever broken at nationalfile.com. Tell us what's coming up.
[2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:16.000]  Alex, this is like you were saying earlier.
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:22.000]  This is a window into the psyche of the sick control freaks who lord over society.
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:25.000]  It's a window into the psyche of the Pelosi family.
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  The woman who along with pencil neck Adam Schiff is controlling the universe right now, controlling what happens to this country.
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:35.000]  This is a tale of depravity.
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:41.000]  These allegations are horrifying. If you put yourself in this woman's shoes, there is nothing short.
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:44.000]  And she's got photos and text messages.
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  She's not like Kavanaugh's fake accusers.
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:48.000]  He's got the goods and she's hot.
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:50.000]  Yeah, you add that to it.
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:53.000]  So yeah, this is not some.
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:15:56.000]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[2:15:56.000 --> 2:15:59.000]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[2:15:59.000 --> 2:16:03.000]  Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker.
[2:16:03.000 --> 2:16:06.000]  If you're not protected, everybody sees your information.
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:12.000]  That's why you need flash routers, a custom Wi-Fi router created for privacy.
[2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:19.000]  Flash routers uses a virtual private network or VPN to protect your online activity from hackers, trackers and large corporations.

[2:16:53.000 --> 2:16:58.000]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of Black Rifle Real Estate.com.
[2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:04.000]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out-left sanctuary state until one day I chose to lead my family to freedom.
[2:17:04.000 --> 2:17:12.000]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:17.000]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our Black Rifle Real Estate team is here to help.
[2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:29.000]  Go to BlackRifleRealEstate.com. That's BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[2:17:48.000 --> 2:18:07.000]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson. What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to?
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:16.000]  How far will they go? What's their limit? And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[2:18:16.000 --> 2:18:22.000]  The answer is there is no limit to evil, it is a bottomless pit.
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:31.000]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist or that there's no free will, there's no devil or the God.
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:41.000]  But those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like.
[2:18:41.000 --> 2:18:47.000]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us. Oxford's banned clapping.
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  University of the U.S. has banned 21 gun salutes for veterans. These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:19:02.000]  Infoorstore.com. We have a new product and we got several thousand of these in and they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them.
[2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:13.000]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste and it doesn't compete with super blue that's four to five of colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride free.
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:20.000]  The adult or the children's. These are both excellent toothpaste, concentrates that don't have fillers. People love it.
[2:19:20.000 --> 2:19:29.000]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans but also re-mineralizes the teeth.
[2:19:29.000 --> 2:19:37.000]  Then it has the patented silver salt. Silver in it to knock out the bacteria that cause ginsivitis. This is all proven. You can make claims with this.
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:48.000]  But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:57.000]  So we're really proud of it. It funds the operation. Infoorstore.com. That's why we're still on air. Thanks to you.
[2:19:57.000 --> 2:20:01.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:37.000]  President Trump in a supportive but demanding way. We need some relief in the way of tech censorship. It is totally out of control.
[2:20:37.000 --> 2:20:43.000]  President Trump has it within his hands. He can reverse this right now.
[2:20:43.000 --> 2:20:48.000]  And as I said earlier, you might have seen me on this broadcast earlier today.
[2:20:48.000 --> 2:21:00.000]  We have a story in NationalFile.com that could absolutely unmake this entire impeachment push. It could potentially, if this can get enough coverage, if this can get enough eyeballs,
[2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:09.000]  this can be a major, major blow to Nancy Pelosi. The allegations levied by the ex-girlfriend of Paul Pelosi Jr.
[2:21:09.000 --> 2:21:21.000]  that is the son of Nancy Pelosi are explosive as they are varied. I mean, everything from allegations that he is misusing his mother's office,
[2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:32.000]  he is illegally, allegedly, illegally using his mother's office to go out and solicit donations to actual threats to intimidate people through,
[2:21:32.000 --> 2:21:46.000]  as I say, he goes around saying he's going to break people's legs according to this ex-girlfriend. It's totally and completely insane allegations that he has paid a homeless person to vandalize this poor lady's home.
[2:21:46.000 --> 2:22:01.000]  It just goes on and on and on. In the video you see on screen right now the article for radio listeners that says breaking Nancy Pelosi's son was executive at gas company that did business in Ukraine.
[2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:09.000]  This fits the narrative of what the ex-girlfriend, that would be Karina Fang, that fits the narrative of what she said.
[2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:21.000]  At one point, Patrick Halley, senior reporter at NationalFile.com, my website, asked Karina, what does Paul do for a living?
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:35.000]  How would you describe his work? Did he ever mention his work to you? And she struggles to come up with an answer. She struggles to say what he does for a living. Let's go ahead and play, if we could, in the control room, clip number two.
[2:22:35.000 --> 2:22:43.000]  Did he ever express to you what it is that he does for a living?
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:56.000]  He has a bunch of strange shell businesses. He talks about one company after another after another and there's really nothing going on.
[2:22:56.000 --> 2:23:01.000]  But he expresses it as if there's something going on to get a bunch of investors.
[2:23:01.000 --> 2:23:16.000]  He's always on the phone talking to investors and telling them about how wonderful and how lucrative, for example, a marijuana outlet in Canada was going to be.
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:31.000]  And they had their own people call back and forth claiming that they were health Canadian officers, but then one of the investors were able to trace the call and it was from their own cell phone.
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:46.000]  So I don't understand what that's about and I'm not for what he does. I'm not exactly sure what he does and he's not able to explain it other than the fact that it's all shells or I haven't seen him work a day.
[2:23:46.000 --> 2:24:07.000]  All I've seen is he's working, but not in a legitimate position. Rather, it's in a very strange, like always on the phone, instructing people to invest in something that's not there.
[2:24:07.000 --> 2:24:20.000]  And so again, this matches up. You saw the article on screen even in that clip. Nancy Pelosi's son was an executive at a gas company that is now the Charter has been suspended and no longer exists.
[2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:30.000]  So was it a shell company as Miss Fang describes? I don't know. Of course, you can see this entire video. It's up at NationalFile.com.
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  It's also up at infowars.com. But that's just one of the many examples of illegal activity that she alleges she witnessed.
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:55.000]  According to Miss Fang, the FBI would really like to speak to Paul Pelosi Jr. And they have yet to be able to because he is constantly making these business trips overseas.
[2:24:55.000 --> 2:25:01.000]  He's constantly going. He goes to Greece. He goes to Germany. He's going all over the place, according to Miss Fang.
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  And at one point, the FBI actually got ahold of her to question her about the whereabouts of this guy who reportedly her children referred to as daddy.
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:22.000]  The FBI got ahold of her and he was there sitting beside her coaching her as to what to say to the FBI.
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  Folks, it's an hour long interview. And I'm just going to start. We'll keep it exciting as we can.
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  But let's just start going through this. And then we're going to get into, we might have some clips of what Alex is doing.
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  We'll start to get into some of the implications, how CPS got involved.
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:50.000]  But let's actually, let's start with that. That seems like the big crux of this because the big part of her allegation.
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  And we have the images. You can see it on nationalfile.com.
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:59.000]  And the number, by the way, we reached out to Paul Pelosi Jr. and asked him for a comment.
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:04.000]  The voicemail picked up. It sure sounded a lot like his voice when he said his name.
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:11.000]  This is the number that's in the lawsuit by Miss Fang that's in the text messages by Miss Fang.
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:16.000]  So Paul Pelosi Jr., the allegation goes like this.
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:25.000]  He used this poor woman. He wanted to have a child with her. He's unable to have a child due to his own physical limitations.
[2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:34.000]  And when he wasn't able to have a child and she stopped cooperating with him to the extent that he demanded, he tossed her to the side.
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:40.000]  And he attempted then to steal a very, very highly valued building.
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:45.000]  And in the process of all this, he said, if you do not sell me this building, this is what she alleges.
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:53.000]  If you do not sell us this building for nothing, then we're going to find a way to get you thrown into a mental institution.
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  We will find a way to evict you from this building and we will get your children taken away.
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:06.000]  That text is in the article. It's got his number on it. That is an extremely hard thing to fake.
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:17.000]  In fact, we asked her, because it is possible still to fake it, we had her simply take a picture of her cell phone.
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:24.000]  And when she took the picture of the cell phone, I mean, that gets a whole lot harder to fake than if somebody takes a screenshot and you can doctor a screenshot.
[2:27:24.000 --> 2:27:28.000]  It's harder to doctor a picture of a picture, in other words.
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:40.000]  And again, there it is on screen, radio listeners. It is a communication from the two of them where he says, if you don't do what I want, then you will be homeless.
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:47.000]  And when you are homeless, CPS is going to take your kids away. That's exactly what happened over a year ago.
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:59.000]  Miss Fang lost her children or children ages between 13 and less than one year old. We'll turn one later this year.
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  It's absolute, absolute depravity. If half of these allegations are true, this is the most damning thing that's come out of electoral politics.
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  This is the most damning thing that's come out regarding Nancy Pelosi.
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:17.000]  And as Alex said in the last segment, this makes what Kavanaugh was accused of seem like nothing.
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:20.000]  What did they have a yearbook from decades ago?
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  We have texts. We have photos. We have emails. We have it all. It's all on nationalfile.com, now on infowars.com as well.
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:36.000]  God bless Patrick Halley for doing this and thank you to InfoWars for giving us this platform to get the message out.
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  We will be back. We're going to discuss, again, we've got to get to the CPS element of this because CPS, it all goes back to the Clinton administration, folks.
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:52.000]  That's where this practice of ripping children away, her profit, began. And Patrick Halley has detailed that extensively.
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  You're watching the Alex Jones show. We'll be right...
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:29:02.000]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners. If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system, but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up,
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:05.000]  this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[2:29:05.000 --> 2:29:14.000]  I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:19.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:25.000]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse,
[2:29:25.000 --> 2:29:31.000]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:37.000]  So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[2:29:37.000 --> 2:29:43.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com. Over $1,000 in great off-the-grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.
[2:29:43.000 --> 2:29:50.000]  And the best part? You're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200. Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.
[2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:54.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[2:29:54.000 --> 2:30:02.000]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up. I've said it many times, I will never give in.
[2:30:02.000 --> 2:30:11.000]  I will never give up, but I could give out. And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity,
[2:30:11.000 --> 2:30:19.000]  to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace,
[2:30:19.000 --> 2:30:24.000]  that most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech.
[2:30:24.000 --> 2:30:33.000]  And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word about newswords.com,
[2:30:33.000 --> 2:30:39.000]  infowords.com and banned.video. And that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever.
[2:30:39.000 --> 2:30:46.000]  And that if you tell people, hey, the banned truth they don't want you to have is at infowords.com.com.
[2:30:46.000 --> 2:30:54.000]  So take heart, folks. They've had to censor everybody and shut everybody down because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[2:30:54.000 --> 2:31:01.000]  Major report out of major university, researchers working on food-based treatment to slow aging science daily,
[2:31:01.000 --> 2:31:09.000]  probiotics in the gut of a particular type, cause your entire body to be healthier and make you live longer and make you not get intestinal cancer.
[2:31:09.000 --> 2:31:17.000]  We have the very best formula, literally, with what they even mentioned in the studies. And it explains the hormone called FGF21,
[2:31:17.000 --> 2:31:25.000]  pro longevity, heals the entire body and actually reverses aging, but is only made in the lower intestine.
[2:31:25.000 --> 2:31:31.000]  Oh, and what does it say? It's fiber from a spectrum of certain types of berries that grows this.
[2:31:31.000 --> 2:31:39.000]  And yes, this is a plug. Gut fusion. And what do we have in this? High auric berry blend, strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, cranberry,
[2:31:39.000 --> 2:31:45.000]  escoglio, grape and pomegranate. It's the pulp from them that then grows this.
[2:31:45.000 --> 2:31:52.000]  Gut fusion for children, for young people, for old people, for everybody. This is fiber and glutamine. You're not going to find a better formula.
[2:31:52.000 --> 2:31:53.000]  Gut fusion, it's amazing.
[2:31:53.000 --> 2:32:04.000]  MFOLWARSHORE.COM. I spend a lot of time reminding the MFOLWARS family of listeners and viewers that without you, we won't be on the air.
[2:32:04.000 --> 2:32:11.000]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you. But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better
[2:32:11.000 --> 2:32:21.000]  and raising the alarm as modern ball reviewers. But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[2:32:21.000 --> 2:32:26.000]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third-party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration.
[2:32:26.000 --> 2:32:36.000]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there. And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[2:32:36.000 --> 2:32:46.000]  So it's not a burden to support MFOLWARSHORE. It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom.

[2:33:16.000 --> 2:33:24.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I am Tom Pepper filling in for Alex while he goes to again.
[2:33:24.000 --> 2:33:40.000]  In a supportive fashion, confront President Trump over big tech censorship as the president makes a stop in North Austin, Texas to, I guess, Pat, the leader of Apple, Tim Apple, I believe, is what Trump prefers to mask.
[2:33:40.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  He's going to pat him on the head for moving a handful of jobs back to the United States, even as the company brings a Chinese social credit system into the United States with the banning of Alex Jones and many others,
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:34:00.000]  even as they admit that they have partnered with Communist China. They are getting a thumbs up from President Trump and folks just like Alex Jones.
[2:34:00.000 --> 2:34:12.000]  I love the president, but we can't be sycophantic. We have to be able to point out when his logic is flawed. But returning to this very important story, it's up at nationalphile.com.
[2:34:12.000 --> 2:34:23.000]  Pelosi's son's ex-girlfriend claims forced abortion, abuse, weaponizing CPS, and massive fraud all occurred in their relationship.
[2:34:23.000 --> 2:34:34.000]  You can also find it at infowars.com. I highly recommend if you're looking for something. If you want to be horrified later, it's better than any Halloween movie in the past decade.
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:49.000]  Go check out the hour long interview between Patrick Halley, senior reporter for Nationalphile, and Miss Fang. It is some of the most shocking, shocking information you will ever hear.
[2:34:49.000 --> 2:34:58.000]  We're going to get into all of the different facets of this, but I want people to understand. This is the beat that Patrick Halley has been following.
[2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:08.000]  He's also a writer for Epic Times where he does amazing work. This is the beat that he's been following. What's happening with CPS, particularly in left wing states like California?
[2:35:08.000 --> 2:35:19.000]  Patrick believes that it has been totally and completely weaponized. So CPS is being used by antifa, Democrats, you name it. These left to scum.
[2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:29.000]  If they see a Trump supporting family, maybe they're homeschooling, maybe they go to church every Sunday. Well, now you can call CPS. You can ruin that family's life.
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:43.000]  And I'm not saying that exactly is what happened to Miss Fang, but it is a bizarre and shocking situation. One of the reasons why CPS was called and they say that she's crazy.
[2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:53.000]  They say that she hallucinated this entire relationship with Paul Pelosi despite all of the images, years worth of images, years worth of texts, years worth of emails.
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:36:02.000]  It goes back to beyond the early 2000s when they first met. They first met in 1998. They started corresponding digitally in the early 2000s.
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:09.000]  We've got emails going back this entire time. I've reviewed them myself. We vetted this thoroughly, but they claim that she hallucinated.
[2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:15.000]  And CPS buys that hook, line and sinker.
[2:36:15.000 --> 2:36:28.000]  So as we mentioned, Miss Fang had her latest child just last year. I'm going to read from the article when Karina Fang had her baby Rosie at a California Medical Center in 2018.
[2:36:28.000 --> 2:36:37.000]  The baby was almost immediately taken away from her and Fang was placed in a mental institution.
[2:36:37.000 --> 2:36:52.000]  This is because of an anonymous complaint sent to CPS that Miss Fang believes had information in it that could only have come from one Paul Pelosi junior.
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:37:00.000]  It had the information that she had not shared with her friends, not shared with her family, not shared with anybody about her having an abortion.
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:06.000]  So instead of having another man's child, she could have Mr. Pelosi's child.
[2:37:06.000 --> 2:37:15.000]  This is an allegation that she only brought up the first time publicly that she ever discussed this was to national file in the interview we recorded last night.
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:21.000]  So it looks like we have Alex on screen here. Is he on his way or is this a live report that I'm missing?
[2:37:21.000 --> 2:37:37.000]  I'm going to lead the censorship against myself and so many others now and Apple has moved to communist China. Let's give them the code keys. They're helping block Taiwanese flags and Hong Kong emojis.
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:47.000]  Now Facebook working with Apple is openly blocking old clips of Obama calling for a border wall. That's called hate now.
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:56.000]  I mean this is massive censorship. Big Tech sees control of American communications and is doing this.
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:38:05.000]  And Trump's up here with Ivanka and Jared Kushner who are best buds with Tim Cook. Old crazy eyes.
[2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:22.000]  And so yeah, this is it. I went to Bullhorn Trump at the White House, had a Twitter was there by blessing by luck by my synchronicity by certain deputy I was there in D.C. and had to catch the exact time they were having the meeting in Bullhorn and they thought I'd been tipped off to it.
[2:38:22.000 --> 2:38:24.000]  What's the next exercise you take?
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:25.000]  I'm watching.
[2:38:25.000 --> 2:38:40.000]  All right. And then I said Trump please do something. He's saying something. He does nothing. This is beyond censorship. This is chilling effect, AI controlling what you can say and what you can do.
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:46.000]  And now blocking people that say Trump's innocent online. They're calling that fake news.
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:51.000]  Well the impeachment. I mean this is total control and it's very dangerous.
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:56.000]  I don't know 2.4 miles.
[2:38:56.000 --> 2:38:58.000]  I go left or right on the right.
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:38:59.000]  You'll make a right.
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:05.000]  You know that's where my first radio studio was. 989 JFK. I don't know right on that side.
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:06.000]  It's a good station.
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:11.000]  Yeah it covers like half the state.
[2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:13.000]  Well there's a tallest tower in Texas that FM tower.
[2:39:13.000 --> 2:39:15.000]  That's where I first heard you at 989.
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:23.000]  Almost 3,000 feet. Maybe the other station is only 18,000 watts. It went past San Antonio and almost to Dallas.
[2:39:23.000 --> 2:39:31.000]  Okay. Stay in attack formation. I'm on the leader.
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:35.000]  Several fighters are broken off from the main group.
[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:37.000]  Come with me.
[2:39:37.000 --> 2:39:43.000]  This is Al Gore approves of this car. It's a 25 horsepower.
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:50.000]  It's not a super hellcat. It's a fake one.
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:52.000]  Yeah, good old open hole.
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:56.000]  For four years I drove up here all the time.
[2:39:56.000 --> 2:39:59.000]  There it is. One, two, one hole.
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:02.000]  So again, I am I guess protesting Trump.
[2:40:02.000 --> 2:40:04.000]  And you know I love Trump. I support Trump.
[2:40:04.000 --> 2:40:06.000]  Glad he's there. Glad it's not Hillary.
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:10.000]  But he said oh we're going to take strong action six months ago against Big Tech.
[2:40:10.000 --> 2:40:13.000]  And I guess he's taking strong action.
[2:40:13.000 --> 2:40:17.000]  It's one thing if he's you know going in a goblin's nest to politically take out the goblins.
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:19.000]  Get some goblin blood and vomit on him.
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:24.000]  But to be caught kissing a goblin. Suck him up with a goblin.
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:26.000]  Catch him in bed with a goblin.
[2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:31.000]  In bed with a goblin. In bed with a goblin.
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:33.000]  That's open hole.
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:37.000]  The next one right here.
[2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:43.000]  Got a message from security. He said hurry.
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  I mean we know Trump's coming in the motorcade behind us from a side road.
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:50.000]  And I was just on air. Papert's doing a big show right now.
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:53.000]  My gav's coming up a live feed 10-4s.com. 4-slash-show.
[2:40:53.000 --> 2:40:56.000]  Twitter cuts this off.
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:40:58.000]  So we're mixing our feeds in there.
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:00.000]  Band off video.
[2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:02.000]  Okay, how far are we now? Like two minutes?
[2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:04.000]  Yeah. I wish I could text him.
[2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:07.000]  Yeah, text him on your phone.
[2:41:07.000 --> 2:41:08.000]  Yeah, that's fine.
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:09.000]  Are we going left?
[2:41:09.000 --> 2:41:10.000]  Yeah, we're going to make it right here.
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:13.000]  And then we're going to get off on the right pretty close.
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  So it's right again?
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:19.000]  Yeah, then we'll make it right off this. We're out of trace.
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  Which is you're going to want to get over pretty quick 24 miles.
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:28.000]  I'm going to let them know.
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:36.000]  This manufacturing facility, that's 1-2-4-5-5 Research Boulevard in North Austin, Texas.
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:41.000]  He has said he's inviting the InfoWars audience to, of course, go out and peacefully,
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:46.000]  politically make it clear to the president that we need and expect to see action
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:54.000]  against the big tech censors who are destroying what's left of the First Amendment in this country.
[2:41:54.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  Alex Jones, of course, was the tip of the iceberg since Alex Jones was banned 16, 18 months ago.
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:04.000]  We've seen hundreds, if not thousands of conservatives be banned.
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:07.000]  We've seen them be debanked. We've seen them be taken off PayPal.
[2:42:07.000 --> 2:42:13.000]  I personally know congressional candidates who, because of big tech censorship,
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:17.000]  they're not allowed to essentially fundraise.
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:23.000]  Let's bring the audio back up and we'll go out to Alex Jones on the way.
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:32.000]  This was in, so when I moved here in 98, I was flipping around finding stations and I found that 98.
[2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:34.000]  Hey, where's the truck?
[2:42:34.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  We're going to go up here. It's going to be up to the right.
[2:42:43.000 --> 2:42:48.000]  Alex Jones on his way seems to be receiving a hero's welcome.
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:53.000]  Stay tuned. We'll have more of this coverage when we come back until Twitter gets rid of them.
[2:43:19.000 --> 2:43:28.000]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans, but also re-mineralizes the teeth.
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:34.000]  Then it has the patented silver salt, silver in it to knock out the bacteria that causes gensivitis.
[2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:36.000]  This is all proven. You can make claims with this.
[2:43:36.000 --> 2:43:42.000]  But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses,
[2:43:42.000 --> 2:43:47.000]  and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[2:43:47.000 --> 2:43:51.000]  So we're really proud of it. It funds the operation in FullWarStore.com.
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:54.000]  That's why we're still on air, thanks to you.
[2:43:54.000 --> 2:43:58.000]  Beto O'Rourke came out dozens of times and said,
[2:43:58.000 --> 2:44:00.000]  we're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles.
[2:44:00.000 --> 2:44:07.000]  And he got all the other Democrats on the stage, nine others, to agree and said that he was a hero.
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:08.000]  Think about that.
[2:44:08.000 --> 2:44:11.000]  Now, those Democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control.
[2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:18.000]  Their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing
[2:44:18.000 --> 2:44:21.000]  and incredible levels of violent crime.
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:23.000]  They know what they're doing.
[2:44:23.000 --> 2:44:28.000]  And now the Supreme Court's come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:31.000]  for what criminals do using their firearms.
[2:44:31.000 --> 2:44:35.000]  My goodness, ladies and gentlemen, this country is under such incredible attack.
[2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:40.000]  But more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:43.000]  and they're going to follow the original Bill of Rights and Constitution
[2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:46.000]  and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns.
[2:44:46.000 --> 2:44:49.000]  So you see, a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens.
[2:44:49.000 --> 2:44:52.000]  Well, we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws.
[2:44:55.000 --> 2:45:00.000]  There's a famous quote by Marine Corps General in the Korean War
[2:45:00.000 --> 2:45:06.000]  when three million Chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the Marines.
[2:45:06.000 --> 2:45:10.000]  More than 50 to one, some estimates have it.
[2:45:10.000 --> 2:45:14.000]  But the point is they were outnumbered and the general was told,
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:15.000]  General, we're completely surrounded.
[2:45:15.000 --> 2:45:19.000]  He said, good, we can attack in all directions.
[2:45:19.000 --> 2:45:23.000]  Well, that's the point that Info Wars has reached.
[2:45:23.000 --> 2:45:24.000]  And it really is epic.
[2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:25.000]  It really is biblical.
[2:45:25.000 --> 2:45:29.000]  And we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support.
[2:45:29.000 --> 2:45:35.000]  But it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete.
[2:45:35.000 --> 2:45:39.000]  And it's not just Americans, but folks all over the world are completely silenced
[2:45:39.000 --> 2:45:43.000]  when it comes to speaking the name of a CIA fake whistleblower
[2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:48.000]  or exposing a pedophile or speaking out against dangerous vaccines.
[2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:53.000]  Because by Info Wars having its own platform, that checkmate's the globalist.
[2:45:56.000 --> 2:45:59.000]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson.
[2:45:59.000 --> 2:46:07.000]  What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to?
[2:46:07.000 --> 2:46:08.000]  How far will they go?
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:09.000]  What's their limit?
[2:46:09.000 --> 2:46:16.000]  And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[2:46:16.000 --> 2:46:19.000]  The answer is there is no limit to evil.
[2:46:19.000 --> 2:46:22.000]  It is a bottomless pit.
[2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:28.000]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist.
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:30.000]  Or that there's no free will.
[2:46:30.000 --> 2:46:32.000]  There's no devil or the God.
[2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:38.000]  But those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress
[2:46:38.000 --> 2:46:42.000]  and where we can live and what our houses can be like.
[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:46.000]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us.
[2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:48.000]  Oxford's banned clapping.
[2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:51.000]  University's the US have banned 21 gun salutes for veterans.
[2:46:51.000 --> 2:46:57.000]  These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[2:46:57.000 --> 2:47:00.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:39.000]  Oh my God.
[2:47:39.000 --> 2:47:45.000]  Apple runs slave factories in Communist China and has suicide meds around the buildings
[2:47:45.000 --> 2:47:49.000]  so people don't kill themselves.
[2:47:49.000 --> 2:47:57.000]  Tim Cook planned the censorship against the Mara Khan.
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:47:59.000]  Tim Cook is involved with the Chaikans.
[2:47:59.000 --> 2:48:07.000]  And I know President Trump was at the moon's stockage very much late.
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:28.000]  Apple is in bad with the Chaikans.
[2:48:28.000 --> 2:48:32.000]  Everybody share this live links watching.
[2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:35.000]  And on the main stage, Warsaw.
[2:48:35.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  He's also got a black belt.
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:43.000]  All right, start it now.
[2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:46.000]  Give it a big start.
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:53.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, America is back.
[2:48:53.000 --> 2:48:59.000]  America is back.
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  Donald Trump is fighting corruption.
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:08.000]  And Donald Trump is innocent.
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:11.000]  America lost Trump.
[2:49:11.000 --> 2:49:15.000]  America lost it.
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:18.000]  The Communist Chinese are censoring their people.
[2:49:18.000 --> 2:49:21.000]  President Trump should confront Tim Cook.
[2:49:21.000 --> 2:49:26.000]  The left supports Communist China and the censorship.
[2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:37.000]  America is alive.
[2:49:37.000 --> 2:49:39.000]  America is alive.
[2:49:39.000 --> 2:49:53.000]  The left supports Communist China and the left supports America.
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:50:08.000]  America is back.
[2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:12.000]  President Trump needs the same against Apple's censorship
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:17.000]  working with the Communist Chinese.
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:24.000]  President Trump needs to stop the censorship.
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:28.000]  President Trump needs to say no to the censorship of Apple.
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:32.000]  President Trump needs to defend free speech.
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:36.000]  President Trump needs to expose Jeffrey Hepstein
[2:50:36.000 --> 2:50:39.000]  and the black belt.
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:49.000]  America is free speech.
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:52.000]  It stands against Apple's cowardice.
[2:50:52.000 --> 2:50:59.000]  And America stands against America's pride.
[2:50:59.000 --> 2:51:04.000]  And America rocks.
[2:51:04.000 --> 2:51:14.000]  And America is free speech.
[2:51:14.000 --> 2:51:24.000]  And America is free speech.
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:33.000]  And America is free speech.
[2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:39.000]  Against the censorship.
[2:51:39.000 --> 2:51:55.000]  Somebody just threw something?
[2:51:55.000 --> 2:51:58.000]  This has got to go back up there somewhere.
[2:51:58.000 --> 2:52:01.000]  Keep going. Let's look at the map.
[2:52:01.000 --> 2:52:04.000]  Look, those cars are going to the right.
[2:52:04.000 --> 2:52:09.000]  Alex just confronted the anti-Trump protesters in the area.
[2:52:09.000 --> 2:52:11.000]  They were not happy to see him.
[2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:13.000]  It was a stark contrast.
[2:52:13.000 --> 2:52:18.000]  Earlier, Alex Jones was going by supporters, driving by supporters of President Trump.
[2:52:18.000 --> 2:52:23.000]  He's, of course, in the armored vehicle you've been seeing more and more of recently
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:27.000]  as it becomes necessary and it's a great, great fun thing for Alex, I'm sure, as well.
[2:52:27.000 --> 2:52:29.000]  Let's go ahead and bring the volume up.
[2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:33.000]  It looks like he might have found some more people to trigger.
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:37.000]  Apple is nurturing the Chinese people.
[2:52:37.000 --> 2:52:45.000]  Apple is helping supply the people of Hong Kong.
[2:52:45.000 --> 2:52:54.000]  Apple needs to stop this in China, Hong Kong and America.
[2:52:54.000 --> 2:53:02.000]  Apple is an authoritarian leftist company working with the Communist Chinese.
[2:53:02.000 --> 2:53:05.000]  Communist China is controlling Apple.
[2:53:05.000 --> 2:53:14.000]  Communist China is working with Apple to put millions of people in concentration camps.
[2:53:14.000 --> 2:53:20.000]  President Trump needs to stand up to Apple's charity.
[2:53:20.000 --> 2:53:31.000]  President Trump needs to tell Apple to stop censoring.
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:59.160]  They could have gone out there and made a left I think.
[2:53:59.160 --> 2:54:05.120]  So, again, Alex Jones is here, yes, as a supporter of President Trump, but he is calling
[2:54:05.120 --> 2:54:10.480]  attention to the fact that Apple is behind a significant portion of the tech censorship.
[2:54:10.480 --> 2:54:18.080]  Of course, all of his Apple podcast, iTunes podcast, were banned last year in the great
[2:54:18.080 --> 2:54:20.200]  purge of everything.
[2:54:20.200 --> 2:54:21.200]  Alex Jones.
[2:54:21.200 --> 2:54:22.200]  And of course, they didn't just do Alex.
[2:54:22.200 --> 2:54:26.200]  They did everything infowars, David Knight as well.
[2:54:26.200 --> 2:54:33.200]  So Alex is here, bullhorning Tim Cook, Tim Apple, let's bring the volume back up.
[2:54:33.200 --> 2:54:59.200]  Apple is here, Apple is here, Apple is here.
[2:54:59.200 --> 2:55:11.960]  If you are in the area, Alex has invited folks to go out and join the festivities peacefully,
[2:55:11.960 --> 2:55:13.560]  lawfully, legally.
[2:55:13.560 --> 2:55:22.960]  It's the Flex Manufacturing Facility at 12455 Research Boulevard in North Austin, Texas.
[2:55:22.960 --> 2:55:28.640]  And let's just take a moment while Alex is working on finding some more folks to have
[2:55:28.640 --> 2:55:29.640]  fun with.
[2:55:29.640 --> 2:55:34.500]  Let's take a moment to remember that this is the time to take advantage of the unbelievable
[2:55:34.500 --> 2:55:44.360]  Black Friday sales at InfowarsStore.com, including the new teeth whitening fluoride-free toothpaste.
[2:55:44.360 --> 2:55:48.960]  That is something that to my knowledge, you cannot simply cannot find in stores.
[2:55:48.960 --> 2:55:54.840]  To whitening plus fluoride free seems to be something that nobody else has come up with.
[2:55:54.840 --> 2:55:57.400]  Nobody seems to realize that that would be worthwhile.
[2:55:57.400 --> 2:56:04.400]  Let's get the volume up right now.
[2:56:04.400 --> 2:56:24.520]  Looks like Alex was just confronted by police who told him he could not go in a given direction.
[2:56:24.520 --> 2:56:30.960]  Of course, at these events, the security becomes more and more intense as President Trump arrives.
[2:56:30.960 --> 2:56:34.800]  President Trump was just minutes behind them on the highway.
[2:56:34.800 --> 2:56:38.320]  It is possible that President Trump is now there with them.
[2:56:38.320 --> 2:56:40.760]  There was another police officer earlier blowing the whistle.
[2:56:40.760 --> 2:56:45.360]  I don't think that they liked Alex standing in the moving vehicle.
[2:56:45.360 --> 2:56:49.920]  But this is an example of exercising your first amendment right.
[2:56:49.920 --> 2:56:54.400]  And that is what Alex Jones is doing, fighting for all of those who supported President Trump
[2:56:54.400 --> 2:57:03.560]  in 2016 and are now being censored, systematically purged off the Internet by big tech.
[2:57:03.560 --> 2:57:05.960]  This is why Infowars needs your support.
[2:57:05.960 --> 2:57:09.920]  They've given me a platform to spread a very, very important story, the biggest story that
[2:57:09.920 --> 2:57:14.000]  I have ever broken on my new website, nationalfile.com.
[2:57:14.000 --> 2:57:17.160]  And they are able to do it only with your help.
[2:57:17.160 --> 2:57:24.080]  Infowars is the only outlet that could survive the onslaught that it has been dealt over
[2:57:24.080 --> 2:57:26.320]  the past year and a half.
[2:57:26.320 --> 2:57:32.680]  And Alex needs your support to continue going out and having fun like you are seeing right
[2:57:32.680 --> 2:57:33.680]  now.
[2:57:33.680 --> 2:57:38.800]  I'll be back for the first 15 minutes of the next hour here on The Alex Jones Show.
[2:57:38.800 --> 2:57:40.520]  We'll see what Alex gets up to.
[2:57:40.520 --> 2:57:41.520]  Stay tuned.
[2:57:41.520 --> 2:57:45.560]  We will be right back.
[2:57:45.560 --> 2:57:50.280]  About a month ago, President Trump announced that he was going to move his domicile from
[2:57:50.280 --> 2:57:55.080]  New York City to Florida, where he's always said he planned to retire to.
[2:57:55.080 --> 2:57:58.040]  And the left got so excited.
[2:57:58.040 --> 2:58:04.720]  They said, oh, he's about to resign and leave instead of facing impeachment and he's running
[2:58:04.720 --> 2:58:05.720]  to Florida.
[2:58:05.720 --> 2:58:08.360]  Well, now we know why the president did that.
[2:58:08.360 --> 2:58:11.080]  He knew the left is controlled appeals courts.
[2:58:11.080 --> 2:58:15.000]  We're going to say that he had to give up his tax returns so they can pour over them
[2:58:15.000 --> 2:58:18.400]  and harass every business partner he's got.
[2:58:18.400 --> 2:58:22.520]  They want to terrorize people that he's worked with.
[2:58:22.520 --> 2:58:26.600]  And by moving his domicile from New York to Florida, that gets around the New York law
[2:58:26.600 --> 2:58:32.040]  they've passed to get his tax returns that are supposed to be private.
[2:58:32.040 --> 2:58:37.240]  So all those people out there holding their breath for the president to resign.
[2:58:37.240 --> 2:58:45.000]  In his words, we're kicking the deep state's ass and he's never going to resign.
[2:58:45.000 --> 2:58:51.040]  Major report out of major university researchers working on food based treatment to slow aging
[2:58:51.040 --> 2:58:56.400]  science daily probiotics in the gut of a particular type cause your entire body to be healthier
[2:58:56.400 --> 2:58:59.440]  and make you live longer and make you not get intestinal cancer.
[2:58:59.440 --> 2:59:03.240]  We have the very best formula literally with what they even mentioned in the studies and
[2:59:03.240 --> 2:59:10.440]  it explains the hormone called FGF 21 pro longevity heals the entire body and actually
[2:59:10.440 --> 2:59:15.120]  reverses aging but is only made in the lower intestine.
[2:59:15.120 --> 2:59:16.120]  Oh, and what does it say?
[2:59:16.120 --> 2:59:21.200]  It's fiber from a spectrum of certain types of berries that grows this.
[2:59:21.200 --> 2:59:22.400]  And yes, this is a plug.
[2:59:22.400 --> 2:59:23.400]  Gut fusion.
[2:59:23.400 --> 2:59:24.800]  And what do we have in this?
[2:59:24.800 --> 2:59:30.680]  High auric berry blend, strawberry blueberry, blackberry, cranberry, escoblio, grape and
[2:59:30.680 --> 2:59:31.680]  pomegranate.
[2:59:31.680 --> 2:59:35.240]  It's the pulp from them that then grows this.
[2:59:35.240 --> 2:59:38.640]  Gut fusion for children, for young people, for old people, for everybody.
[2:59:38.640 --> 2:59:40.600]  This is fiber and glutamine.
[2:59:40.600 --> 2:59:41.920]  You're not going to find a better formula.
[2:59:41.920 --> 2:59:42.920]  Gut fusion.
[2:59:42.920 --> 2:59:43.920]  It's amazing.
[2:59:43.920 --> 2:59:44.920]  EmpowerShore.com.
[2:59:44.920 --> 2:59:49.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:49.920 --> 2:59:58.920]  They are the same as the Communist Chinese that ran over people with tanks to suppress
[2:59:58.920 --> 2:59:59.920]  their speech.
[2:59:59.920 --> 3:00:00.920]  We are here to promote free speech.
[3:00:00.920 --> 3:00:01.920]  America is back.
[3:00:01.920 --> 3:00:02.920]  America is back.
[3:00:02.920 --> 3:00:03.920]  America is back.
[3:00:03.920 --> 3:00:08.920]  America is back.
[3:00:08.920 --> 3:00:10.960]  America is back.
[3:00:10.960 --> 3:00:13.200]  America is back.
[3:00:13.200 --> 3:00:17.220]  America is back.
[3:00:17.220 --> 3:00:24.800]  America is back.
[3:00:24.800 --> 3:00:29.800]  President Trump needs to stand against internet censorship.
[3:00:29.800 --> 3:00:30.800]  Internet censorship is un-American.
[3:00:30.800 --> 3:00:31.800]  Apple is leading.
[3:00:31.800 --> 3:00:32.800]  Apple is leading.
[3:00:32.800 --> 3:00:35.800]  the censorship of Americans.
[3:00:35.800 --> 3:00:39.800]  Apple needs to stop censoring America.
[3:00:39.800 --> 3:00:42.800]  Trump! We love Trump! We love Trump!
[3:00:42.800 --> 3:00:45.800]  We love Trump! We love free speech!
[3:00:45.800 --> 3:00:48.800]  Trump needs to stand up for free speech.
[3:00:48.800 --> 3:00:53.800]  President Trump needs to stand up for free speech.
[3:00:53.800 --> 3:01:02.800]  President Trump needs to tell Tim Cook to stop censoring Americans.
[3:01:02.800 --> 3:01:06.800]  It's time to stop the censorship.
[3:01:06.800 --> 3:01:09.800]  It's time to stop the censorship.
[3:01:09.800 --> 3:01:16.800]  Apple is evil! Apple is evil! Hillary for president!
[3:01:16.800 --> 3:01:22.800]  Apple is evil working with the chai comms to censor the American people.
[3:01:22.800 --> 3:01:33.800]  Liberals accept censorship of the modern communist Chinese running over political dissidents for their free speech.
[3:01:33.800 --> 3:01:37.800]  Put your hands on the wheel!
[3:01:37.800 --> 3:01:46.800]  America is back! America is back! America is back!
[3:01:46.800 --> 3:01:53.800]  America!
[3:01:53.800 --> 3:01:58.800]  Apple is working with the communist Chinese to censor.
[3:01:58.800 --> 3:02:02.800]  Apple is helping round up political dissidents and kill them.
[3:02:02.800 --> 3:02:14.800]  Apple is an evil authoritarian system running the worst factories in China with suicide nets where the people kill themselves.
[3:02:14.800 --> 3:02:19.800]  Apple is evil! Apple is evil!
[3:02:19.800 --> 3:02:25.800]  And President Trump needs to tell Apple to stop censoring.
[3:02:25.800 --> 3:02:31.800]  President Trump needs to tell Apple to stop censoring.
[3:02:31.800 --> 3:02:32.800]  What's up, brother?
[3:02:32.800 --> 3:02:38.800]  America is back! America is back! America is back!
[3:02:38.800 --> 3:02:43.800]  President Trump needs to not just kill Apple to move its factories to the U.S. That's good.
[3:02:43.800 --> 3:02:52.800]  But President Trump needs to challenge Tim Cook to demand good working conditions in communist China at their Foxconn slave laboratories.
[3:02:52.800 --> 3:02:57.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, Apple is working against America.
[3:02:57.800 --> 3:03:07.800]  President Trump needs to tell Apple to stop censoring.
[3:03:07.800 --> 3:03:15.800]  President Trump needs to tell Apple to stop censoring.
[3:03:15.800 --> 3:03:19.800]  Apple needs to stop censoring.
[3:03:19.800 --> 3:03:23.800]  Apple needs to stop censoring.
[3:03:23.800 --> 3:03:26.800]  Apple needs to stop censoring.
[3:03:26.800 --> 3:03:29.800]  Apple needs to stop censoring.
[3:03:29.800 --> 3:03:34.800]  Apple needs to stop censoring.
[3:03:34.800 --> 3:03:41.800]  must demand that Apple stop censoring and stop suppressing their people.
[3:03:41.800 --> 3:03:51.800]  President Trump must demand that Apple stop censoring the American people and the people of China.
[3:03:51.800 --> 3:03:58.800]  Apple is evil. Apple is evil. Apple is evil. Apple is evil.
[3:03:58.800 --> 3:04:05.800]  Look how nice our factors are compared to China. Apple is exploiting the people of China.
[3:04:05.800 --> 3:04:12.800]  Apple is suppressing free speech. Google is evil. Apple is evil.
[3:04:12.800 --> 3:04:30.800]  Apple is evil. Apple is evil. Apple is evil.
[3:04:30.800 --> 3:04:40.800]  President Trump is to stand up against the last dictatorship. America on his back. America on his back.
[3:04:40.800 --> 3:04:45.800]  America on his back.
[3:04:45.800 --> 3:04:53.800]  If you do not go away, you'll be back in 60 seconds with more of Alex. Stay tuned.
[3:04:53.800 --> 3:04:59.800]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true, but I'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't
[3:04:59.800 --> 3:05:04.800]  predictions that came out of a crystal ball. I could see where the globalists were going.
[3:05:04.800 --> 3:05:09.800]  I could see what their in-game agenda was, what their goal was.
[3:05:09.800 --> 3:05:14.800]  And I knew that when they were setting us up to be de-platformed that they were really setting the press
[3:05:14.800 --> 3:05:23.800]  to take everybody off air, to silence everyone, to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers
[3:05:23.800 --> 3:05:27.800]  so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed.
[3:05:27.800 --> 3:05:33.800]  What the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future.
[3:05:33.800 --> 3:05:38.800]  It was the model of info wars as much as the information that had to be silenced,
[3:05:38.800 --> 3:05:44.800]  because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed.
[3:05:44.800 --> 3:05:51.800]  And that's why keeping info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever.
[3:05:51.800 --> 3:05:58.800]  The cops are getting pissed that we're not wearing seatbelts, so I don't know what we're going to do.
[3:05:58.800 --> 3:06:11.800]  Hey, yeah, well he could just get out and we could just be in the crowd.
[3:06:11.800 --> 3:06:17.800]  So it looks like they are, let's go ahead and bring that audio down for just a minute.
[3:06:17.800 --> 3:06:22.800]  It looks like they're having difficulties. Police are not happy that they're not wearing seatbelts.
[3:06:22.800 --> 3:06:27.800]  I'm not sure how Alex is supposed to wear a seatbelt in this position.
[3:06:27.800 --> 3:06:37.800]  But of course, Alex Jones, if you are just tuning in, is attending the President Trump visiting and patting Tim Cook,
[3:06:37.800 --> 3:06:43.800]  the apples are on the head for bringing a handful of jobs back to the United States.
[3:06:43.800 --> 3:06:50.800]  Alex Jones, as do I, of course, supports President Trump greatly, but when President Trump is wrong,
[3:06:50.800 --> 3:06:55.800]  we cannot be sycophants. We have to call him out, especially when it impacts people like Alex Jones,
[3:06:55.800 --> 3:07:00.800]  organizations like Info Wars that have been hit by tech censorship.
[3:07:00.800 --> 3:07:09.800]  Worse than anyone else, and Apple is of course at the helm of this, they admitted that they merged with Communist China.
[3:07:09.800 --> 3:07:14.800]  They are the Communist Chinese force in the United States.
[3:07:14.800 --> 3:07:19.800]  It looks like we might be safe to bring up some volume again. Let's try bringing the volume back up.
[3:07:19.800 --> 3:07:21.800]  Watch that video.
[3:07:23.800 --> 3:07:25.800]  Got it. Awesome. All right.
[3:07:25.800 --> 3:07:27.800]  Coming down.
[3:07:28.800 --> 3:07:30.800]  Yeah.
[3:07:30.800 --> 3:07:40.800]  All right. Alex is moving the armored vehicle and entering the crowds.
[3:07:40.800 --> 3:07:43.800]  The cops are trying to stop me recording this. Are we still going?
[3:07:43.800 --> 3:07:46.800]  I'm going back again. I just stopped when we stopped.
[3:07:46.800 --> 3:07:47.800]  We're not going live anymore?
[3:07:47.800 --> 3:07:50.800]  No, we're still live. Most people have ever had.
[3:07:50.800 --> 3:07:55.800]  Yeah. Even with the shadow ban, this is all blocked, but InfoWars.com works like a show, has a mix of live feed,
[3:07:55.800 --> 3:08:00.800]  and band.video. So the police said, listen, you can't have a sound device that loud unless you've got people without seat belts.
[3:08:00.800 --> 3:08:02.800]  We're going to give you tickets, and you don't stop it.
[3:08:02.800 --> 3:08:05.800]  It's hard to do that what's going to happen, so now we're ready to go.
[3:08:05.800 --> 3:08:06.800]  With old trustee.
[3:08:06.800 --> 3:08:08.800]  We're going mobile.
[3:08:08.800 --> 3:08:09.800]  All right, here we go.
[3:08:09.800 --> 3:08:11.800]  All right.
[3:08:12.800 --> 3:08:14.800]  Here's the good news. The cops have us under control.
[3:08:14.800 --> 3:08:17.800]  Alex Jones is on point, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:08:17.800 --> 3:08:24.800]  He was not allowed to drive around without seat belts or use audio equipment that loudly, so now he's going old school.
[3:08:24.800 --> 3:08:28.800]  I love America. We love you. We love you. We got to put the lip cards.
[3:08:33.800 --> 3:08:38.800]  I love this bumper sticker. God is life. That's right. Love that sign right there. That's what America's all about right there.
[3:08:38.800 --> 3:08:39.800]  There it is.
[3:08:39.800 --> 3:08:41.800]  The evil cult of death. We're going to defeat them.
[3:08:41.800 --> 3:08:42.800]  Okay.
[3:08:43.800 --> 3:08:45.800]  You can get ahead of me doing this. Do whatever you want.
[3:08:45.800 --> 3:08:46.800]  Yeah, yeah.
[3:08:46.800 --> 3:08:48.800]  What are you doing?
[3:08:53.800 --> 3:08:55.800]  What are you doing?
[3:08:57.800 --> 3:08:59.800]  America is back.
[3:08:59.800 --> 3:09:10.800]  America is back.
[3:09:10.800 --> 3:09:21.800]  Now Alex Jones is walking toward the crowd, getting ready to shout Trump's praises and criticisms on foot.
[3:09:21.800 --> 3:09:25.800]  He has some of the Info Wars favorites with him.
[3:09:25.800 --> 3:09:27.800]  Here he is.
[3:09:27.800 --> 3:09:31.800]  To the censors at Apple.
[3:09:31.800 --> 3:09:34.800]  Apple runs slave factories in China.
[3:09:34.800 --> 3:09:37.800]  They help surveil the poor Chinese people.
[3:09:37.800 --> 3:09:40.800]  Apple is in the authoritarian fraud.
[3:09:40.800 --> 3:09:48.800]  And President Trump needs a demand of Apple that they stand up against censorship here.
[3:09:48.800 --> 3:09:53.800]  That they stand up against censorship overseas.
[3:09:53.800 --> 3:09:59.800]  Do you support Chinese censorship? Do you support Apple helping censor Americans?
[3:09:59.800 --> 3:10:03.800]  Do you support free speech? Do you think I should be silent?
[3:10:03.800 --> 3:10:04.800]  No.
[3:10:04.800 --> 3:10:05.800]  Okay.
[3:10:05.800 --> 3:10:07.800]  Do you support stopic censorship? How's it going?
[3:10:07.800 --> 3:10:08.800]  I don't like it.
[3:10:08.800 --> 3:10:09.800]  Trump's a racist.
[3:10:09.800 --> 3:10:11.800]  I've had no much help before, buddy.
[3:10:11.800 --> 3:10:12.800]  It's all about free speech.
[3:10:12.800 --> 3:10:13.800]  Is Apple wrong-censoring?
[3:10:13.800 --> 3:10:14.800]  Yes.
[3:10:14.800 --> 3:10:15.800]  Good.
[3:10:15.800 --> 3:10:16.800]  We agree.
[3:10:16.800 --> 3:10:17.800]  Hey, Alex Jones.
[3:10:17.800 --> 3:10:18.800]  Stop the censor, too.
[3:10:18.800 --> 3:10:20.800]  Did Jeffrey Epstein kill him some?
[3:10:20.800 --> 3:10:21.800]  No, he was murdered.
[3:10:21.800 --> 3:10:22.800]  I told him he was going to be murdered.
[3:10:22.800 --> 3:10:24.800]  He told him!
[3:10:24.800 --> 3:10:32.800]  Jeffrey Epstein was running giant salt kidnapping rings for the Queens of Black Metal people.
[3:10:32.800 --> 3:10:39.800]  America is back...
[3:11:09.800 --> 3:11:19.800]  the American people, and the Chinese people, and it's long. And the leftists are over there saying I shouldn't have speech.
[3:11:19.800 --> 3:11:24.800]  The left is a group of authoritarian criminals and middle-patients.
[3:11:24.800 --> 3:11:30.800]  And I'm here to exercise my first amendment to tell President Trump,
[3:11:30.800 --> 3:11:44.800]  bring factories to America, but we want Trump to stand up for free speech and to tell Tim Cook and the Chai comms that what they're doing is wrong.
[3:11:44.800 --> 3:11:52.800]  This guy has a great vocabulary, says F you, over and over and over again, because he doesn't support free speech.
[3:11:52.800 --> 3:12:03.800]  Let's go ahead and drop that audio. The crown can't contain itself as usual. Alex Jones is there with the unifying message and they shout obscenities.
[3:12:03.800 --> 3:12:13.800]  We'll bring that back up here in a couple seconds to see if the Antifa type degenerate you see on screen there is able to get a hold of himself.
[3:12:13.800 --> 3:12:17.800]  If he's not, we'll just kind of color commentate as Alex has fun.
[3:12:17.800 --> 3:12:22.800]  I just want to remind everybody infowarstore.com. This is why it's important.
[3:12:22.800 --> 3:12:28.800]  He does. He still goes out and faces this scum.
[3:12:28.800 --> 3:12:35.800]  It happens all the time and you can only find it at infowars.com slash show and band video.
[3:12:35.800 --> 3:12:39.800]  And you can only support it at infowarstore.com.
[3:12:39.800 --> 3:12:43.800]  I want to remind everybody as well because it looks like we're going to need to get Alex back up momentarily.
[3:12:43.800 --> 3:12:49.800]  But Mike Adams, the health ranger will be guest hosting the rest of the fourth hour.
[3:12:49.800 --> 3:13:17.800]  Let's see if it's safe to bring this audio back up.
[3:13:17.800 --> 3:13:27.800]  Let's see if it's safe.
[3:13:27.800 --> 3:13:56.800]  Let's see if it's safe to bring this audio back up.
[3:13:56.800 --> 3:14:25.800]  It's safe to bring this audio back up.
[3:14:25.800 --> 3:14:33.800]  So here you see some lunatic. It looks like the guy from a couple years ago through coffee at Alex in Portland
[3:14:33.800 --> 3:14:40.800]  bringing up Sandy Hook when he's talking about America's back.
[3:14:40.800 --> 3:14:43.800]  We'll go ahead and keep this audio low, but we'll keep it going.
[3:14:43.800 --> 3:14:48.800]  I just want to remind everybody to support this broadcast.
[3:14:48.800 --> 3:15:03.800]  It's safe to bring this audio low, but we'll keep it going.
[3:15:03.800 --> 3:15:32.800]  It's safe to bring this audio low, but we'll keep it going.
[3:15:32.800 --> 3:15:51.800]  Let's go ahead and go out to Alex Jones here, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:15:51.800 --> 3:15:56.800]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:15:56.800 --> 3:16:02.800]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[3:16:02.800 --> 3:16:07.800]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too.
[3:16:07.800 --> 3:16:12.800]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[3:16:50.800 --> 3:16:56.800]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right? So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[3:16:56.800 --> 3:17:03.800]  Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected everybody sees your information.
[3:17:03.800 --> 3:17:08.800]  That's why you need Flash Routers, a custom Wi-Fi router created for privacy.

[3:17:48.800 --> 3:18:03.800]  About a month ago, President Trump announced that he was going to move his domicile from New York City to Florida, where he's always said he planned to retire to.
[3:18:03.800 --> 3:18:14.800]  And the left got so excited, they said, oh, he's about to resign and leave instead of facing impeachment and he's running to Florida.
[3:18:14.800 --> 3:18:19.800]  Well, now we know why the president did that. He knew the left is controlled appeals courts.
[3:18:19.800 --> 3:18:26.800]  We're going to say that he had to give up his tax returns so they can pour over them and harass every business partner he's got.
[3:18:26.800 --> 3:18:30.800]  They want to terrorize people that he's worked with.
[3:18:30.800 --> 3:18:40.800]  And by moving his domicile from New York to Florida, that gets around the New York law they passed to get his tax returns that are supposed to be private.
[3:18:40.800 --> 3:18:51.800]  So all those people out there holding their breath for the president to resign, in his words, we're kicking the deep state's ass and he's never going to resign.
[3:18:51.800 --> 3:18:59.800]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up. I've said it many times, I will never give in.
[3:18:59.800 --> 3:19:11.800]  I will never give up, but I could give out. And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity, to see evil running rampant like this,
[3:19:11.800 --> 3:19:20.800]  and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace, that most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech.
[3:19:20.800 --> 3:19:33.800]  And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word about newswords.com, infowords.com, and band.video.
[3:19:33.800 --> 3:19:43.800]  And that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever. And then if you tell people, hey, the banned truth they don't want you to have is at infowords.com, forward slash show, and band.video.
[3:19:43.800 --> 3:19:51.800]  So take heart, folks, they've had to censor everybody and show everybody down because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[3:20:14.800 --> 3:20:18.800]  Bill Hicks.
[3:20:18.800 --> 3:20:24.800]  Alex Jones, Bill Hicks.
[3:20:24.800 --> 3:20:36.800]  infowords.com, infowords.com, infowords.com, infowords.com, free speech, free speech.
[3:20:36.800 --> 3:20:43.800]  Apple H3 speaks.
[3:20:43.800 --> 3:20:50.800]  Democrats need elections. They want to overturn the 2016 election and stall Hillary.
[3:20:50.800 --> 3:21:00.800]  No! The military is back and the Democrats are going down and your fake impeachment is burning in place.
[3:21:00.800 --> 3:21:16.800]  Trump! Trump! Trump!
[3:21:16.800 --> 3:21:30.800]  It's time for Trump to defend the First Amendment and Apple is an enemy of free speech that helps communist China suppress people.
[3:21:30.800 --> 3:21:42.800]  And Trump needs to stop the persecution until he ends his life. And Trump needs to put you on the still. We need to defend free speech.
[3:21:42.800 --> 3:21:57.800]  infowords.com, infowords.com, infowords.com, infowords.com, infowords.com, infowords.com, infowords.com, infowords.com, infowords.com,
[3:21:57.800 --> 3:22:01.800]  Don't worry, buddy, we're kicking your ass, you know it.
[3:22:01.800 --> 3:22:06.800]  No, she doesn't, buddy.
[3:22:06.800 --> 3:22:10.800]  Democrats always come over and talk about my kids and how they want them.
[3:22:10.800 --> 3:22:13.800]  This whole man just came over with, we got your kids.
[3:22:13.800 --> 3:22:16.800]  You don't have my kids, you perverts, you child molesters.
[3:22:16.800 --> 3:22:21.800]  You're a bunch of pot belly, chicken net pervert devil worshipers.
[3:22:21.800 --> 3:22:23.800]  Yeah, appreciate it, Alex.
[3:22:23.800 --> 3:22:26.800]  I know you want to kill every kid in the town in the womb.
[3:22:26.800 --> 3:22:28.800]  I know you like to tell them afters.
[3:22:28.800 --> 3:22:31.800]  But just devil worship and slime bags are gonna get it.
[3:22:31.800 --> 3:22:34.800]  You got that, you bunch of devil worshipers.
[3:22:34.800 --> 3:22:36.800]  No, man, get it done.
[3:22:36.800 --> 3:22:40.800]  America is back to slime bag pedophiles.
[3:22:40.800 --> 3:22:43.800]  You can kill it, this is a crap.
[3:22:43.800 --> 3:22:45.800]  You're a whole child molested.
[3:22:45.800 --> 3:22:47.800]  House of cards is coming down.
[3:22:47.800 --> 3:22:49.800]  You child molesters supporters.
[3:22:49.800 --> 3:22:51.800]  America is back.
[3:22:51.800 --> 3:22:53.800]  America is back.
[3:22:53.800 --> 3:22:55.800]  America is back.
[3:22:55.800 --> 3:22:57.800]  America is back.
[3:22:57.800 --> 3:23:07.800]  infowars.com
[3:23:07.800 --> 3:23:09.800]  You're not gonna get our free speech.
[3:23:09.800 --> 3:23:12.800]  America now uses free speech.
[3:23:12.800 --> 3:23:15.800]  And America is standing up for its free speech.
[3:23:15.800 --> 3:23:17.800]  America is back.
[3:23:17.800 --> 3:23:19.800]  America is back.
[3:23:19.800 --> 3:23:21.800]  America is back.
[3:23:21.800 --> 3:23:24.800]  Look at you laughing with your soul sucked.
[3:23:24.800 --> 3:23:28.800]  You have no energy. That's why you want the energy of children.
[3:23:28.800 --> 3:23:31.800]  New vampires are going to hell.
[3:23:31.800 --> 3:23:33.800]  And let's say we passed.
[3:23:33.800 --> 3:23:35.800]  If they repeat the same.
[3:23:35.800 --> 3:23:37.800]  That's right, you guys need to get away from the same.
[3:23:37.800 --> 3:23:39.800]  You love so much.
[3:23:39.800 --> 3:23:41.800]  infowars.com
[3:23:41.800 --> 3:23:43.800]  Free speech is live.
[3:23:43.800 --> 3:23:46.800]  Apple is the enemy of free speech.
[3:23:46.800 --> 3:23:49.800]  That's what needs to confront them over this.
[3:23:49.800 --> 3:23:51.800]  And America is...
[3:23:51.800 --> 3:23:55.800]  Looks like we might have lost our feed.
[3:23:55.800 --> 3:23:58.800]  Just briefly we'll see if it returns.
[3:23:58.800 --> 3:24:01.800]  Alex Jones is live on the ground.
[3:24:01.800 --> 3:24:03.800]  He is...
[3:24:03.800 --> 3:24:05.800]  It looks like it's back.
[3:24:05.800 --> 3:24:07.800]  Looks like we've got the feedback.
[3:24:07.800 --> 3:24:09.800]  Let's go back to it.
[3:24:09.800 --> 3:24:24.800]  Democrats are cataphiles. Democrats are cataphiles. Democrats are ghouls. Democrats are male patients. Democrats are satanists. Democrats are losers. Losers. Losers.
[3:24:24.800 --> 3:24:27.800]  Let's get out of here.
[3:24:27.800 --> 3:24:30.800]  infowars.com
[3:24:30.800 --> 3:24:32.800]  infowars.com
[3:24:32.800 --> 3:24:34.800]  infowars.com
[3:24:34.800 --> 3:24:37.800]  infowars.com
[3:24:37.800 --> 3:24:42.800]  Hey, look, liberals, it's an old lady. You probably want to euthanize her.
[3:24:42.800 --> 3:24:45.800]  Who's a baby you'd want on a border?
[3:24:45.800 --> 3:24:48.800]  infowars.com
[3:24:48.800 --> 3:24:50.800]  America is back.
[3:24:50.800 --> 3:24:52.800]  America is back.
[3:24:52.800 --> 3:24:54.800]  America is back.
[3:24:54.800 --> 3:25:03.800]  And the Democrats want our speech and their ally with Apple and Google who openly suppress the people of China.
[3:25:03.800 --> 3:25:05.800]  Apple is evil.
[3:25:05.800 --> 3:25:08.800]  Apple is evil.
[3:25:08.800 --> 3:25:16.800]  Apple is helping suppress the poor Chinese people and 2 million workers they put in concentration camps.
[3:25:16.800 --> 3:25:18.800]  Apple is evil.
[3:25:18.800 --> 3:25:24.800]  And Trump needs to confront Apple. And that's why we're here.
[3:25:24.800 --> 3:25:33.800]  Trump needs to confront Tim Cook about the suicide factories and the suicide nets and the forced driving of Apple factories.
[3:25:33.800 --> 3:25:35.800]  Sleep labor in China.
[3:25:35.800 --> 3:25:42.800]  Look, it's great to bring factories back here and we support that because people get better. We'll make this a little piece in here because we used to have values.
[3:25:42.800 --> 3:25:47.800]  But Google and Apple are evil.
[3:25:47.800 --> 3:25:53.800]  And they're helping suppress the American people and the people of China.
[3:25:53.800 --> 3:25:56.800]  And it's rude.
[3:25:56.800 --> 3:25:58.800]  infowars.com
[3:25:58.800 --> 3:26:00.800]  infowars.com
[3:26:00.800 --> 3:26:03.800]  infowars.com
[3:26:03.800 --> 3:26:06.800]  I've got to get the pervert.
[3:26:06.800 --> 3:26:13.800]  What I'm doing is real but it's the worst from here.
[3:26:13.800 --> 3:26:16.800]  Let me just ask you if this is a show.
[3:26:16.800 --> 3:26:19.800]  No, Communist China has killed over 100 million people.
[3:26:19.800 --> 3:26:21.800]  Apple has horrible factories there.
[3:26:21.800 --> 3:26:24.800]  They kill people for their speech.
[3:26:24.800 --> 3:26:29.800]  And now the list, like they've done everywhere else, is trying to take off three speech away.
[3:26:29.800 --> 3:26:36.800]  The evils of China, North, Nazi Germany.
[3:26:36.800 --> 3:26:39.800]  President Trump is right to stand up to Communist China.
[3:26:39.800 --> 3:26:43.800]  But he needs to stand up for free speech.
[3:26:43.800 --> 3:26:45.800]  President Trump defend America.
[3:26:45.800 --> 3:26:48.800]  President Trump defend the First Amendment.
[3:26:48.800 --> 3:26:53.800]  President Trump stand up to that monster Tim Cook.
[3:26:53.800 --> 3:26:58.800]  Make America great again, Alex.
[3:26:58.800 --> 3:27:00.800]  Tim Cook is an authoritarian.
[3:27:00.800 --> 3:27:07.800]  Tim Cook has given the Google and Apple tees together with Google to the Chai Kong secret police
[3:27:07.800 --> 3:27:14.800]  and admit that all of your secrets with Apple have been given to the Chinese government.
[3:27:14.800 --> 3:27:18.800]  Apple is working with the Chai Kongs.
[3:27:18.800 --> 3:27:23.800]  Apple is working to suppress the people of China.
[3:27:23.800 --> 3:27:27.800]  And now the people of America.
[3:27:27.800 --> 3:27:35.800]  The globalists are working with Communist China to turn us into another slave colony.
[3:27:35.800 --> 3:27:46.800]  Our basic freedoms are being erased and President Trump must stand up for the First Amendment.
[3:27:46.800 --> 3:27:53.800]  Defend the First Amendment.
[3:27:53.800 --> 3:28:02.800]  Defend free speech. Defend free speech.
[3:28:02.800 --> 3:28:15.800]  Alex Jones is on the ground in North Austin, Texas where President Trump is set to meet with Tim Cook of Apple.
[3:28:15.800 --> 3:28:23.800]  Mike Adams will be on the broadcast, possibly next segment, but Alex is just too fascinating.
[3:28:23.800 --> 3:28:25.800]  We may have more. Alex Jones.
[3:28:25.800 --> 3:28:28.800]  I'm of course Tom Pampered sticking with you here for this segment.
[3:28:28.800 --> 3:28:30.800]  We'll see if I'm here for the next.
[3:28:30.800 --> 3:28:39.800]  But Alex is definitely speaking truth to power and he goes out and confronts this scum.
[3:28:39.800 --> 3:28:47.800]  Wake up, learn something, read a book, turn off the freaking television because they're not teaching you anything but how to be a slave.
[3:28:47.800 --> 3:28:50.800]  And maybe you guys like slavery, maybe you guys...
[3:28:50.800 --> 3:28:54.800]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[3:28:54.800 --> 3:28:57.800]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[3:28:57.800 --> 3:29:04.800]  Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected, everybody sees your information.

[3:29:52.800 --> 3:29:57.800]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson.
[3:29:57.800 --> 3:30:04.800]  What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to?
[3:30:04.800 --> 3:30:07.800]  How far will they go? What's their limit?
[3:30:07.800 --> 3:30:13.800]  And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[3:30:13.800 --> 3:30:19.800]  The answer is there is no limit to evil, it is a bottomless pit.
[3:30:19.800 --> 3:30:25.800]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist.
[3:30:25.800 --> 3:30:28.800]  Or that there's no free will, there's no devil or the God.
[3:30:28.800 --> 3:30:38.800]  But those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like.
[3:30:38.800 --> 3:30:42.800]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us.
[3:30:42.800 --> 3:30:44.800]  Oxford's Band Clapping.
[3:30:44.800 --> 3:30:47.800]  University's the US of Band 21 Gun Salutes for Veterans.
[3:30:47.800 --> 3:30:51.800]  These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[3:30:51.800 --> 3:30:57.800]  Infoorstore.com, we have a new product and we got several thousand of these in.
[3:30:57.800 --> 3:31:00.800]  And they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them.
[3:31:00.800 --> 3:31:04.800]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it but this really is a game changing toothpaste.
[3:31:04.800 --> 3:31:11.800]  And it doesn't compete with super blue that's four to five of colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride free.
[3:31:11.800 --> 3:31:13.800]  The adult or the children's.
[3:31:13.800 --> 3:31:16.800]  These are both excellent toothpaste, concentrates that don't have fillers.
[3:31:16.800 --> 3:31:17.800]  People love it.
[3:31:17.800 --> 3:31:26.800]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans but also re mineralizes the teeth.
[3:31:26.800 --> 3:31:32.800]  Then it has the patented silver salt, silver in it to knock out the bacteria that cause ginsivitis.
[3:31:32.800 --> 3:31:33.800]  This is all proven.
[3:31:33.800 --> 3:31:34.800]  You can make claims with this.
[3:31:34.800 --> 3:31:45.800]  But I had to tell you no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[3:31:45.800 --> 3:31:47.800]  So we're really proud of it.
[3:31:47.800 --> 3:31:49.800]  It funds the operation infowarstore.com.
[3:31:49.800 --> 3:31:50.800]  That's why we're still on air.
[3:31:50.800 --> 3:31:51.800]  Thanks to you.
[3:31:51.800 --> 3:31:58.800]  Beto Rourke came out dozens of times and said we're going to confiscate all your semiautomatic rifles.
[3:31:58.800 --> 3:32:05.800]  And he got all the other Democrats on the stage nine others to agree and said that he was a hero.
[3:32:05.800 --> 3:32:06.800]  Think about that.
[3:32:06.800 --> 3:32:09.800]  Now those Democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control.
[3:32:09.800 --> 3:32:19.800]  Their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime.
[3:32:19.800 --> 3:32:21.800]  They know what they're doing.
[3:32:21.800 --> 3:32:29.800]  And now the Supreme Court's come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms.
[3:32:29.800 --> 3:32:33.800]  My goodness, ladies and gentlemen, this country is under such incredible attack.
[3:32:33.800 --> 3:32:42.800]  But more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment and they're going to follow the original Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[3:32:42.800 --> 3:32:45.800]  And they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns.
[3:32:45.800 --> 3:32:48.800]  So you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens.
[3:32:48.800 --> 3:33:05.800]  Well, we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws.
[3:33:05.800 --> 3:33:18.800]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Mike Adams. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:18.800 --> 3:33:24.800]  This is one of the most bombshell packed days or broadcast you've probably ever seen here on Info Wars.
[3:33:24.800 --> 3:33:26.800]  It's an honor to be joining you today.
[3:33:26.800 --> 3:33:35.800]  Alex is in Austin, of course, with the arrival of President Trump in the city of Austin.
[3:33:35.800 --> 3:33:40.800]  Alex is going to be there reinforcing the importance of freedom of speech to the president and his supporters.
[3:33:40.800 --> 3:33:42.800]  He's there right now, live.
[3:33:42.800 --> 3:33:45.800]  We'll be bullhorning the president and his advisors.
[3:33:45.800 --> 3:33:57.800]  Tom Pappert just has done amazing investigative research as you heard over the last hour or so about what's really happening with the perversion of elitists in our society.
[3:33:57.800 --> 3:34:07.800]  The rise of Satanism, the rise of, I don't know, child sacrifice and then the the praising of the demon child sacrifice.
[3:34:07.800 --> 3:34:15.800]  I don't know, what do you call the false pagan god of Malik, I think is what it is. I'm going to be covering some of that too in today's breaking story.
[3:34:15.800 --> 3:34:25.800]  I'll get to it in a minute. It's about the Colorado public school system now requiring students to role play child sacrifice poems as part of rape training indoctrination.
[3:34:25.800 --> 3:34:28.800]  This is happening in Colorado.
[3:34:28.800 --> 3:34:37.800]  One of the victims of this 16 year old student there is being represented by First Liberty Institute, a law firm in Texas.
[3:34:37.800 --> 3:34:49.800]  And shockingly, the administrator or the superintendent of that school district, excuse me, in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, has allowed this to go on and does not say he's going to stop this.
[3:34:49.800 --> 3:34:59.800]  So students are going to be required to stand up in front of the class and role play, sodomy. I can't even go into it. I can't even say the words here on this broadcast.
[3:34:59.800 --> 3:35:08.800]  It's so evil. It's so twisted. We'll get to that in a minute. I've got a lot of science and medicine updates for you today that are very really crucial.
[3:35:08.800 --> 3:35:27.800]  First, a programming note. Band.video is now carrying my channel, and I've been able to start uploading videos to band.video. I want to share with you. I've got a big breaking kind of a well, a home made medicine breakthrough that I'm going to be sharing with the world.
[3:35:27.800 --> 3:35:35.800]  I mentioned it last week here on the show. I will be uploading that early next year to band.video simultaneously with Brighton.com.
[3:35:35.800 --> 3:35:46.800]  That is a way to make your own anti-cancer nanoparticle medicine at home. No patents required, no royalties required, no pharmacists required.
[3:35:46.800 --> 3:35:55.800]  There will be a disclaimer because you should check with your naturopathic physician before making this medicine, but you'll be able to make it yourself for less than $50.
[3:35:55.800 --> 3:36:12.800]  I am not selling this medicine or any equipment that's used to make it. I have no financial ties to it whatsoever, which is the only way I will probably avoid being arrested and incarcerated for daring to educate the public about how to make your own anti-cancer medicine using what are called structured nanoparticles,
[3:36:12.800 --> 3:36:26.800]  which is technically spoken of botanically end cap structured nanoparticle medicine that is specifically tuned into receptor sites of specific organs and has powerful well-documented anti-cancer properties.
[3:36:26.800 --> 3:36:36.800]  So that will be coming very soon within, I don't know, two months or so on band.video. So thank you, N4Wars, for allowing me that channel on band.video.
[3:36:36.800 --> 3:36:52.800]  Another big story, cold fusion is once again making big headlines. Asia Times has done a big article on cold fusion that talks about how Japan is winning this race for this breakthrough technology.
[3:36:52.800 --> 3:37:06.800]  Now, the reason I got to mention this and their headline is cold fusion too. Japan wins with systematic method. The reason this is important is because America developed this technology first. It was in 1989, 30 years ago,
[3:37:06.800 --> 3:37:21.800]  university of Utah, Salt Lake, Fleischmann and Ponds developed this cold fusion breakthrough technology, which could make fossil fuels obsolete in many contexts, not with vehicles or airplanes or tractors, but with heating buildings.
[3:37:21.800 --> 3:37:30.800]  It produces a tremendous amount of heat at very low cost. The military could use it. Agriculture could use it to heat buildings for, you know, ranch animals and things like that.
[3:37:30.800 --> 3:37:37.800]  Businesses could use it to heat warehouses and operations and, you know, office buildings. Homes could use it.
[3:37:37.800 --> 3:37:50.800]  The Department of Energy at the time in 1989, which has been part of the deep state, which has just brought incredible suffering and destruction upon this country for decades, even generations.
[3:37:50.800 --> 3:38:02.800]  The DOE conspired with the fake news media of 1989 and MIT scientists to say, oh, cold fusion isn't real. There's nothing to it. It's a fraud. It's a hoax.
[3:38:02.800 --> 3:38:08.800]  And so they ran Fleischmann and Ponds out of academia, out of science, and even out of the country.
[3:38:08.800 --> 3:38:24.800]  And now 30 years later, Japan is leading the world in this research, even though there are companies in California right now in America that have mastered this cold fusion technology, which is really called low energy nuclear reactions or LENR.
[3:38:24.800 --> 3:38:36.800]  I just want you to know we had this technology in America. And if Trump wanted to have a breakthrough for this country, Trump should go to California, meet with these companies that are doing this.
[3:38:36.800 --> 3:38:47.800]  And lead the world in clean renewable energy that makes nuclear power obsolete in many ways. It makes fossil fuels partially obsolete for heating buildings and things like that.
[3:38:47.800 --> 3:38:59.800]  This technology was created in America, and America has surrendered it to Japan. So Japan is going to have a multi trillion dollar industry based on this technology.
[3:38:59.800 --> 3:39:07.800]  They'll be licensing this to America and to American companies and universities that need to heat buildings and all these things. Japan is going to rake in all this money.
[3:39:07.800 --> 3:39:18.800]  This should be America's technology. This is America's innovation. Fleischmann and Ponds are scientific heroes of our era. They should go down in history along with Albert Einstein, frankly.
[3:39:18.800 --> 3:39:34.800]  And yet what's really happening in our world today is that they are suppressed. The truth is suppressed. Real science is suppressed. And the deep state strikes again. The deep state suppressing the knowledge and the technology that humanity needs to be set free from the scourge of the deep state
[3:39:34.800 --> 3:39:49.800]  controllers, the military industrial complex, the petroleum complex, all these things. It's not that petroleum is evil like the leftists say. We need fuel to fly airplanes and to run tractors and long haul trucking and things like that.
[3:39:49.800 --> 3:39:56.800]  We've got to have diesel fuel. But we don't need to be heating buildings with fossil fuels. We could do it with coal fusion.
[3:39:56.800 --> 3:40:07.800]  And where is AOC on this issue? She wants to ban combustion engines but doesn't know about coal fusion, of course. They never talk about coal fusion because it's a massive multi-decades cover-up.
[3:40:07.800 --> 3:40:22.800]  It's unreal. Okay. Next story is you know that if you've been caught in a DUI by a breathalyzer, the breathalysers are fake. It's quack science. It's not even real.
[3:40:22.800 --> 3:40:33.800]  This has come out in the media recently. I'll find a story here in a minute. But these fake breathalysers are being used by cops all across the country. When I say fake, what I mean is the science is quackery.
[3:40:33.800 --> 3:40:43.800]  It doesn't even work. It's not even real. And you know, those kits that cops are using to say, oh, you're carrying cocaine or you're carrying meth or I guess, you know, meth, we're on it.
[3:40:43.800 --> 3:40:51.800]  That's the new ad campaign, right? Now they're promoting meth. But when they say you have meth and they have a little test kit and they take a sample of your powder and they put it in their test kit
[3:40:51.800 --> 3:40:58.800]  and they shake it up and they say, oh, look, it changed colors. Look, it's a different color. That means you have meth or you have cocaine. No.
[3:40:58.800 --> 3:41:11.800]  People, it's all fake. It's all completely fake. The science doesn't work. These are fake test kits so that cops can arrest people and have, quote, evidence against them when the test kits don't even work.
[3:41:11.800 --> 3:41:24.800]  It's all fake, people. The fake science, the fake police labs. There was a lab shut down in Austin, Texas by federal prosecutors because the entire lab was faking positive results for cocaine.
[3:41:24.800 --> 3:41:31.800]  No matter what samples the police would bring in to this lab in Austin, and there was another one in Boston that got shut down a couple years ago.
[3:41:31.800 --> 3:41:44.800]  The lab technicians would pretend to do the science and they would say, oh, yeah, test positive for cocaine. And those people would be convicted and imprisoned because now it's scientifically verified evidence, so to speak.
[3:41:44.800 --> 3:41:53.800]  The whole thing is fake. It's all rigged, people. The drunk driving breathalysers are fake. The on the spot drug testing is fake. The police labs are fake.
[3:41:53.800 --> 3:42:05.800]  The science is fake. It's just like fiat currency is fake and the impeachment news is fake. People, it's all fake. And I run a science lab. I know this subject area. I know what it takes to do real testing.
[3:42:05.800 --> 3:42:16.800]  It's quite involved. You can't do it in 30 seconds by shaking a powder in a vial. It doesn't work that way. Law enforcement in America, even though I support local police, I support civil society.
[3:42:16.800 --> 3:42:26.800]  If you're a cop listening to this and you have those test kits, the kits are faked. You've been putting innocent people in prison and you've been lied to about the efficacy and the accuracy of these kits.
[3:42:26.800 --> 3:42:38.800]  They do not work. It's total science fraud. It's massive fakery on a scale that's just, it's horrific. How many innocent people are in prison today because of the fake science that's used to falsely convict these innocent people?
[3:42:38.800 --> 3:42:50.800]  Much more straight ahead here. This is Mike Adams on infowars.com. We'll be back after this break. Stay with us.
[3:43:08.800 --> 3:43:26.800]  I knew that when they were setting a sub PD platform that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody off air to silence everyone to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed.
[3:43:26.800 --> 3:43:43.800]  The globalist really feared was independent media and platforms in the future. It was the model of info wars as much as the information that had to be silenced because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed.
[3:43:43.800 --> 3:43:50.800]  That's why keeping info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever.
[3:43:50.800 --> 3:44:05.800]  Major report out of major university researchers working on food based treatment to slow aging science daily probiotics in the gut of a particular type cause your entire body to be healthier and make you live longer and make you not yet intestinal cancer.
[3:44:05.800 --> 3:44:21.800]  We have the very best formula literally with what they even mentioned in the studies and explains the hormone called FGF 21 pro longevity heals the entire body and actually reverses aging but is only made in the lower intestine.
[3:44:21.800 --> 3:44:38.800]  Oh and what does it say it's fiber from a spectrum of certain types of berries that grows this and yes this is a plug gut fusion and what do we have in this high auric berry blend strawberry blueberry blackberry cranberry escobalio grape and pomegranate.
[3:44:38.800 --> 3:44:48.800]  It's the pulp from them that then grows this gut fusion for children for young people for old people for everybody. This is fiber and glutamine. You're not going to find a better formula.
[3:44:48.800 --> 3:44:54.800]  FGF 21 pro longevity fusion. It's amazing.
[3:44:54.800 --> 3:45:15.800]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up. I've said it many times I will never give in. I will never give up but I could give out and it's very very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most Americans
[3:45:15.800 --> 3:45:31.800]  have been silenced in cyberspace that most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech and to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word about news wars dot com
[3:45:31.800 --> 3:45:44.800]  info wars dot com and banned on video and that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever and then if you tell people hey the band truth they don't want you to have is at info wars dot com forward slash show and banned on video.
[3:45:44.800 --> 3:45:52.800]  So take heart folks they've had to censor everybody to show everybody down because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[3:45:52.800 --> 3:46:03.800]  I spend a lot of time reminding the info wars family of listeners and viewers that without you won't be on the air and I spent a lot of time thanking you.
[3:46:03.800 --> 3:46:18.800]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern Paul Revere's but something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[3:46:18.800 --> 3:46:23.800]  You've got that pledge from me but you've seen the third party test out there the air filtration the water filtration.
[3:46:23.800 --> 3:46:36.800]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there and you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard so it's not a burden to support info wars.
[3:46:36.800 --> 3:46:54.800]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better so visit info store dot com today.
[3:46:54.800 --> 3:47:05.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:05.800 --> 3:47:14.800]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[3:47:14.800 --> 3:47:28.800]  So much breaking news today it's almost difficult to cover it all here's one piece from zero hedge Ukrainian indictment claims seven point four billion dollar Obama linked money laundering plus Biden group take at sixteen point five million dollars.
[3:47:28.800 --> 3:47:41.800]  What this story is about is how the Bidens took over sixteen million dollars in bribes and kickbacks and real extortion money from the barisma company of corrupt Ukraine at the time before they had their new president.
[3:47:41.800 --> 3:47:46.800]  So you talk about bribery corruption fraud racketeering that's the Bidens.
[3:47:46.800 --> 3:48:03.800]  That's Barack Obama who also remember laundered tens of billions of dollars through international means to deliver pallets of cash to Iran so that Iran could fund its nuclear weapons program to create destabilization in the Middle East and threaten America's allies such as Israel.
[3:48:03.800 --> 3:48:17.800]  Now why why is Obama not in prison. Why is Nancy Pelosi using focus groups to say that Trump engaged in bribery when it's clear that Joe Biden engaged in bribery.
[3:48:17.800 --> 3:48:20.800]  Why is Joe Biden free well you know why isn't he indicted.
[3:48:20.800 --> 3:48:30.800]  Well you know the answer is because you're watching Info Wars so you know the hypocrisy of the double standards but that's big news today wanted you to be aware of that before we move on to the big stories.
[3:48:30.800 --> 3:48:39.800]  Another quick thing Elizabeth Warren is now tweeting about hashtag end traffic violence. She says traffic violence is a problem.
[3:48:39.800 --> 3:48:47.800]  Now this is more Orwellian double speak just like they say gun violence is bad because guns kill people. She now says traffic kills people.
[3:48:47.800 --> 3:48:56.800]  Traffic violence is bad. So many people in traffic crashes. She says and we have to end traffic violence. So what is she going to have a waiting period to buy a new car.
[3:48:56.800 --> 3:49:03.800]  She's going to have a car limit. Is she going to have you know cars you have to get a background check to buy a car.
[3:49:03.800 --> 3:49:11.800]  Or she's saying that maybe cars should be confiscated from ownership of civilians and citizens that only law enforcement should have cars and guns.
[3:49:11.800 --> 3:49:24.800]  I mean this is more insanity. Traffic violence. Are you serious. Why can't they just use normal human terms like car crashes kill people or people driving cars that ram the those cars
[3:49:24.800 --> 3:49:35.800]  and the other cars kill people in those cars. It's the drivers that are responsible for the car crashes just as it's the shooters that are responsible for so called gun violence.
[3:49:35.800 --> 3:49:46.800]  Remember every time that there's a terrorist in a van like in Paris and they run over a bunch of innocent pedestrians. What a CNN report. Oh van kills people in wild assault.
[3:49:46.800 --> 3:49:53.800]  We're looking for a van. We can't find the van. Well there was a driver of that van and that driver was a radical Islamic terrorist by the way.
[3:49:53.800 --> 3:50:06.800]  But of course they never say that they they act like these are you know robotic artificially intelligent self conscious self aware vans driving around like your ice cream truck just suddenly spontaneously ignited into
[3:50:06.800 --> 3:50:14.800]  Skynet and is out there running over people. That's not what happens at all. But that's that's kind of what they're implying. All right. Next thing.
[3:50:14.800 --> 3:50:28.800]  Boeing. You've seen all of these attacks on Boeing and some of its justified because Boeing of course messed up its quality control process probably lied to the FAA about the safety of its systems
[3:50:28.800 --> 3:50:41.800]  and killed hundreds of people. Well guess what big pharma kills so many people that it's like a Boeing jumbo max 737 falling out of the sky every single day in America.
[3:50:41.800 --> 3:50:50.800]  Big pharma kills far more people than Boeing ever did even if Boeing is complicit in that and which is yet to be proven. Maybe it's just a bunch of engineering mistakes.
[3:50:50.800 --> 3:51:01.800]  Who knows. But big pharma their products are known to be toxic and the vaccine industry which is part of big pharma of course has legal immunity so they can kill children with impunity.
[3:51:01.800 --> 3:51:12.800]  And they actually put deadly toxins and ingredients into the vaccines such as aluminum and squalene adjuvants and mercury and of course a board of human fetal tissue and many other toxic ingredients.
[3:51:12.800 --> 3:51:24.800]  They kill children. There's no outcry. No but Boeing is the problem. Well let me tell you something. I'd rather ride on a Boeing 737 max jumbo jet and take a vaccine shot.
[3:51:24.800 --> 3:51:33.800]  It would be safer to be in a Boeing airplane than to take a vaccine shot that's approved by the FDA or the CDC vaccines or what's killing people and pharmaceuticals.
[3:51:33.800 --> 3:51:43.800]  What's killing people every day all across the country. I mean 100,000 Americans a year at minimum are killed by toxic pharmaceuticals but everybody wants to blame Boeing.
[3:51:43.800 --> 3:51:56.800]  I mean it's insane. OK. Let's get to the main story here today. The Colorado Public School District of Steamboat Springs and this was this was covered by First Liberty Institute.
[3:51:56.800 --> 3:52:06.800]  They are a pro bono law legal firm in Texas. They've taken this case and this involves a teacher who I'm not going to name here.
[3:52:06.800 --> 3:52:24.800]  Fox News has named the teacher but we'll just treat him like the whistleblower and pretend we don't know who it is. The teacher required the students especially female students to stand up and read these sexually explicit violent poems by this lunatic poet named Ginsburg.
[3:52:24.800 --> 3:52:40.800]  And Ginsburg's poem involves all of this celebration of Malik which is the demon pagan god of child sacrifice and in this poem and I've reprinted some of this in the story.
[3:52:40.800 --> 3:52:48.800]  I think it's up on info wars dot com. If not it's on natural news. I'm not going to use any of the direct profanity but it's.
[3:52:48.800 --> 3:52:58.800]  This is what the student the 16 year old female student named case and her last name is case and what is it Skylar case and she had to say words like this again.
[3:52:58.800 --> 3:53:09.800]  I won't use any profanity so you don't have to bleep it but quote let themselves be F in the a blank blank by saintly motorcyclists and screamed with joy.
[3:53:09.800 --> 3:53:31.800]  A vision of ultimate C word and come alluding the last jism of consciousness this these are the poet's words that is an insane radical leftist sweetened the blank of a million girls trembling in the sunset who cut their wrist three times successfully unsuccessfully or
[3:53:31.800 --> 3:53:52.800]  successfully unsuccessfully who who metaphor for oral sex and were given that metaphor for all sex by those human sailors and so on it is a rambling of left wing madness and it's vile it's putrid it's violent.
[3:53:52.800 --> 3:54:05.800]  And this was part of a class where students were also required to role play through texting being sexually assaulted or come on to through unwanted sexual contact for example.
[3:54:05.800 --> 3:54:11.800]  And these students were just terrorized by this they're like wait a minute I'm going to public school what what's going on here.
[3:54:11.800 --> 3:54:23.800]  Well this poet Ginsburg who died in 1997 by the way he was a socialist he promoted socialism he promoted what would be called LGBT in today's terms.
[3:54:23.800 --> 3:54:29.800]  He hated capitalism he hated the concepts of America he obviously hated Christ and in the poem.
[3:54:29.800 --> 3:54:40.800]  He talks about like beams of light coming out of the sky and awakening his consciousness to malloc the demon pagan demon god of child sacrifice.
[3:54:40.800 --> 3:54:49.800]  This is what your teenage students are being required to act out in class in public schools in Colorado.
[3:54:49.800 --> 3:55:02.800]  And then when the administrator who's named in the article when he was contacted by First Liberty the law firm in Texas to say hey why is this happening why do you have students who are subjected to this demonic indoctrination the
[3:55:02.800 --> 3:55:14.800]  sexual perversion this vulgarity that they are they are being violated by these so-called exercises by a teacher who's obviously super twisted and probably shouldn't be teaching teenage girls in high school.
[3:55:14.800 --> 3:55:23.800]  The administrator said oh well we're sorry that we didn't give proper notice to the parents so that they could opt out of this experience are you kidding me.
[3:55:23.800 --> 3:55:35.800]  The superintendent that's the title the superintendent didn't say no this is wrong we shouldn't teach demon indoctrination and child sacrifice sexual perversion and violence in our classrooms he didn't say that.
[3:55:35.800 --> 3:55:44.800]  He said no we're sorry that your parents weren't notified in time so that they could opt out of this insane experience I mean think about this.
[3:55:44.800 --> 3:55:58.800]  The superintendent of steamboat Springs Colorado seems to be complicit with this what's he going to do have a like a praise malloc pledge of allegiance now while the the American pledge of allegiance will be banned in their schools.
[3:55:58.800 --> 3:56:11.800]  I mean look I hate to say it but I predicted all this I predicted this in a previous article is talking about 25 things that will happen if impeachment removes Trump from power and in that article I talked about the rise of demonism the rise of evil.
[3:56:11.800 --> 3:56:24.800]  The just the these demon portals where evil spirits are literally entering this realm and then infesting the bodies of these people who become school teachers and administrators and maybe superintendents and certainly lawmakers.
[3:56:24.800 --> 3:56:32.800]  You know globalist elitist the child rapist the child traffickers we are infested that our world is infested with pure evil.
[3:56:32.800 --> 3:56:40.800]  And if you got to say anything positive about Trump it's that Trump has forced evil to show its hand.
[3:56:40.800 --> 3:56:53.800]  Trump has forced this out into the open where now it's undeniable and they're having to kill people like Jeffrey Epstein to try to prevent the full details of the child trafficking and child rape and pedophilia from coming out.
[3:56:53.800 --> 3:56:56.800]  But they can't stop at all because there have been so many victims of this.
[3:56:56.800 --> 3:57:01.800]  It's all coming out just like what Tom Pappert covered today here on Infowars in an earlier segment.
[3:57:01.800 --> 3:57:02.800]  It's all coming out.
[3:57:02.800 --> 3:57:19.800]  So be prepared spiritually psychologically be prepared because what you are about to witness happening in our world it will crater it will fracture your psyche in ways that you have never experienced before because pure evil is on display.
[3:57:19.800 --> 3:57:27.800]  And it's the demon crats who are behind it and they want to destroy everything that is good everything that is innocent everything that you value in your life.
[3:57:27.800 --> 3:57:34.800]  And we are here at Infowars fighting to defend life liberty truth and happiness for all humanity.
[3:57:34.800 --> 3:57:35.800]  Thanks for watching.
[3:57:35.800 --> 3:57:51.800]  I want to show you straight ahead.
