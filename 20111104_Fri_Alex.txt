[00:35.720 --> 00:39.480]  free video streams up at info wars.com and info wars moneybomb.com
[00:39.480 --> 00:45.480]  tyranny crusher 2 just went for $3,500 on eBay and we'll thank the folks that are
[00:45.480 --> 00:49.800]  supporting us so we can get more equipment and do things like that a lot
[00:49.800 --> 00:54.400]  of other stuff different auctions going with signed pro-liberty memorabilia
[00:54.400 --> 01:01.640]  info wars memorabilia all up at info wars moneybomb.com that has a link on
[01:01.640 --> 01:07.080]  it to the eBay area we've had a big successful moneybomb so far we we're
[01:07.080 --> 01:13.680]  doing about like the moneybomb the year before last we're about $250,000 right
[01:13.680 --> 01:17.000]  now I'm told they're about to update it and of course there's a lot of mail come
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.960]  in and a lot of things were auctioning and the moneybomb will continue on out
[01:21.960 --> 01:27.680]  into the weekend as it always does and so I would imagine we're probably gonna
[01:27.680 --> 01:34.560]  get up to around $400,000 which is really a good goal and I'd like to fill
[01:34.560 --> 01:38.680]  the rocket so we can launch at the globalist of the info war all the way
[01:38.680 --> 01:43.960]  but I want to thank all of you that have supported the moneybomb and I've told
[01:43.960 --> 01:47.760]  people if you it needs to be middle-class people that needs to be folks
[01:47.760 --> 01:52.040]  that have extra money that donate to the alternative media I'm not like a

[02:16.360 --> 02:20.160]  hire at least three people more equipment and more bandwidth and things
[02:20.160 --> 02:24.640]  that's that's gonna be a big help to put that a hundred percent into the fight
[02:24.640 --> 02:29.000]  against the globalist and I would I'd like to get 400,000 but will it it'll
[02:29.000 --> 02:32.440]  take until next week to really really know engage all of that but I want to

[03:01.520 --> 03:07.040]  more reporters more crew just everything is just our overall output
[03:07.040 --> 03:13.000]  against the globalist has absolutely intensified and so I want to commend and
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.680]  thank everybody out there again I just cannot thank you enough I'm obviously a
[03:17.680 --> 03:22.560]  little bit punch-drunk here I think I'm even more tired than I was last year man
[03:22.560 --> 03:28.320]  I am just absolutely hammered right now with with with with being tired I'm a
[03:28.320 --> 03:33.040]  wimp I mean I don't know how people do these what's the record guys Google
[03:33.040 --> 03:37.120]  record filibuster I know it's the Texas House of Representatives maybe the Texas
[03:37.120 --> 03:41.560]  Senate back in the 60s it's over two days I mean can you imagine not being able
[03:41.560 --> 03:46.640]  to sit down not being able to eat not being able to go to the bathroom and not
[03:46.640 --> 03:52.920]  being able to shut up I mean I just can't even imagine that I am certainly a
[03:52.920 --> 03:59.320]  wimp compared to the people like that we got Alan Watt always extremely
[03:59.320 --> 04:04.920]  informative coming up in the next segment on world events Jesse Ventura
[04:04.920 --> 04:09.280]  I'll tell more of it when we come back from break called me last night he shut
[04:09.280 --> 04:12.320]  down a press conference about 55 minutes out front the federal courthouse in
[04:12.320 --> 04:16.520]  Minneapolis and then he's gonna try to call in after that or he may even call
[04:16.520 --> 04:19.760]  in before but I think he said we're probably calling after he doesn't carry
[04:19.760 --> 04:25.760]  a cell phone but his wife has one Terry and he's got the hotline number so if
[04:25.760 --> 04:28.920]  Ventura calls him whatever guess we've gone on whether it's Jim Mars or Alan
[04:28.920 --> 04:35.760]  I'm sure they'll be able to they'll be happy to go into a timeout timeout
[04:35.760 --> 04:41.080]  as a kid I meant like football timeout you know like go you know go into the
[04:41.080 --> 04:46.800]  bench for a breather go to the dugout there's another sports analogy while
[04:46.800 --> 04:51.080]  Ventura makes a statement here and we got Jim Mars as I said coming up and
[04:51.080 --> 04:56.240]  Alan Watt info wars money bomb dot com stay with us
[04:59.760 --> 05:03.760]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[05:03.760 --> 05:08.120]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[05:08.120 --> 05:12.280]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[05:12.280 --> 05:16.320]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[05:16.320 --> 05:20.200]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[05:20.200 --> 05:24.480]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[05:24.480 --> 05:28.640]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[05:28.640 --> 05:32.960]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[05:32.960 --> 05:36.680]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[05:36.680 --> 05:40.840]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[05:40.840 --> 05:44.240]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[05:44.240 --> 05:47.960]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[05:47.960 --> 05:53.480]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government

[07:10.160 --> 07:13.800]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[07:13.800 --> 07:18.640]  I've turned the members influence on our president in Congress and they really
[07:18.640 --> 07:23.400]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American

[07:37.360 --> 07:40.840]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[07:40.840 --> 07:46.080]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[07:46.080 --> 07:51.760]  have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic on dvd

[08:54.800 --> 09:00.760]  the next hour now listen Jesse Ventura called me last night while I was on
[09:00.760 --> 09:04.440]  air while I was interviewing Alfred a desk we're doing this 27 hour marathon
[09:04.440 --> 09:08.480]  broadcast and I saw his Ventura I answered the phone and he's and I'd
[09:08.480 --> 09:11.440]  already had a call from Tyrell who's flying out of Los Angeles he's on the
[09:11.440 --> 09:16.160]  plane his son with the bad news that the federal judge throughout the case you
[09:16.160 --> 09:22.320]  don't get a day in court TSA I mean you know lamp poles with microphones in them
[09:22.320 --> 09:27.600]  cancer viruses in the vaccines totally open borders the Super Congress running
[09:27.600 --> 09:33.520]  everything the president legalizing aggravated felons who are illegals just
[09:33.520 --> 09:38.240]  just total lawlessness peace prize to warmongers torture sacred arrest the
[09:38.240 --> 09:42.400]  troops openly growing opium and Afghanistan publicly just just just
[09:42.400 --> 09:47.840]  complete an absolute abject evil and Ventura was not even angry he was more
[09:47.840 --> 09:52.920]  just speechless he said stunned and he said I let you know you know as soon as
[09:52.920 --> 09:58.640]  the ruling came through and but I even knew about it before it hit the news
[09:58.640 --> 10:02.080]  wires about 10 minutes before it was funny to get the news first I got there
[10:02.080 --> 10:05.080]  from Tyrell and very tour calling about an hour later to let me know but the
[10:05.080 --> 10:11.520]  point is he's a big cell phone user and he will be mobbed probably at the press
[10:11.520 --> 10:15.720]  conference at noon coming up about 50 minutes at the federal courthouse and
[10:15.720 --> 10:19.680]  guys I want you guys to find the local news there because undoubtedly they're
[10:19.680 --> 10:23.920]  probably gonna have it live or at least on the web and we'll carry a few minutes
[10:23.920 --> 10:27.600]  of that and then with our guests I'm sure our guests will understand even when
[10:27.600 --> 10:32.360]  Ventura calls in and he said he would but he's gonna call the hotline and
[10:32.360 --> 10:36.520]  stuff so we'll see what happens with that he may end up calling in the third
[10:36.520 --> 10:40.080]  hour and quite frankly I was gonna punch out in the third hour and have Watson
[10:40.080 --> 10:49.720]  come in because I'm not tough like other people Bill Mayer or Meyer has the
[10:49.720 --> 11:00.000]  longest filibuster in US history and in in May of 1977 near the close of the
[11:00.000 --> 11:06.240]  regular session he spoke for 43 hours against a workers compensation bill so
[11:06.240 --> 11:09.320]  you're not allowed to go to the bathroom you're not allowed to sit down you're not
[11:09.320 --> 11:14.120]  allowed to lean if you talk continually I cannot imagine that now a lot of times
[11:14.120 --> 11:17.680]  they just start babbling after a while and ho ho the problem is here you got
[11:17.680 --> 11:20.880]  guests on I find it all to be thought-provoking I'm actually paying
[11:20.880 --> 11:25.160]  attention to what people are saying I'm actually paying attention to what
[11:25.160 --> 11:28.680]  people are doing I'm thinking is I think that's what is so incredibly
[11:28.680 --> 11:35.120]  exhausting about it now some of the news obviously Obama tells allies US will
[11:35.120 --> 11:42.880]  attack Iran by fall of 2012 so so now there may be some can kicking but Israel
[11:42.880 --> 11:49.760]  said they're getting ready to strike who knows what's going to happen also we
[11:49.760 --> 11:54.000]  got another report here fluoride the calcifier of the soul again Jesse
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.360]  Ventura to give statement about judges missing TSA lawsuit thanks to Obama the
[11:58.360 --> 12:03.080]  Al Qaeda flag is now flying high and proud of Olivia that's confirmed Al Qaeda
[12:03.080 --> 12:05.760]  has been given control the media here won't cover but it's in the foreign
[12:05.760 --> 12:08.800]  news we got the David I could interview up there was pretty powerful
[12:08.800 --> 12:12.600]  yesterday remember who we are George Norrie was also joined us and so many
[12:12.600 --> 12:18.680]  others SWAT team kills a Marine veteran at their home then wouldn't let the
[12:18.680 --> 12:21.920]  ambulance help him a new report for courthouse news and more details on that
[12:21.920 --> 12:28.000]  case and then obviously we've got all the regular stuff that's happening and
[12:28.000 --> 12:33.800]  going on around the world continuing here they're lying and still seeing
[12:33.800 --> 12:39.440]  unemployment's 9% every real economist says it's above 22 Israeli Navy boards
[12:39.440 --> 12:44.040]  gauze about boat orders will tell it to change course no go judge tosses Jesse
[12:44.040 --> 12:48.120]  Ventura airport scans I'm reading drugs here nearly 200 tons of prescription
[12:48.120 --> 12:54.800]  drugs have been turned in part of this DEA turn your pills in thing
[12:54.800 --> 13:01.840]  continuing too much time sitting increases risk of developing cancer no
[13:01.840 --> 13:06.880]  kidding your body's then not oxygenated all of that is going on a corn
[13:06.880 --> 13:11.240]  official scramble firing workers and shredding documents have to expose as
[13:11.240 --> 13:15.840]  players behind the scenes yet trying to take over occupy Wall Street Union chief
[13:15.840 --> 13:20.160]  says we need more militancy occupy protesters but the left's always
[13:20.160 --> 13:23.320]  claiming anybody that's in the Constitution is violent you're for
[13:23.320 --> 13:27.200]  freedom you're violent by Ron Paul and Alex Jones MSNBC say they want violence
[13:27.200 --> 13:34.920]  really really like your peace president and Greece is in turmoil over debt plan
[13:34.920 --> 13:39.480]  EU is weighing an exit Sarkozy's asking the US for help you've already given

[16:06.320 --> 16:10.360]  overwhelm us right now to make us go into a catatonic psychological state of
[16:10.360 --> 16:16.800]  learned helplessness Alan what I think it could be part but partly that because
[16:16.800 --> 16:21.560]  of the ones who are following this whole program but you gotta remember that
[16:21.560 --> 16:26.680]  most of the populations are not following the program then they've never
[16:26.680 --> 16:32.120]  really been awake they follow mainstream and lots of entertainment I think
[16:32.120 --> 16:36.800]  they're pushing now because it's time to push for this whole amalgamation into the
[16:36.800 --> 16:41.000]  they call it the Great Transformation that's the official title of it at the
[16:41.000 --> 16:47.480]  stage of it and the transformation of the whole planet into the system the
[16:47.480 --> 16:52.120]  quickly touched on he even he talked about the economic side of it mainly at
[16:52.120 --> 16:56.960]  the economic side as they amalgamate the continents and the central banks into
[16:56.960 --> 17:01.720]  one system under the Bank of International Settlements he talked
[17:01.720 --> 17:08.040]  about this in the 60s so we're on course with all of this and I think the
[17:08.040 --> 17:12.520]  public are so dumb down today to be honest with you it's time now to push for
[17:12.520 --> 17:17.680]  the next part all the public really know from watching mainstream is that all
[17:17.680 --> 17:22.560]  economies are in bad shape pretty well except for China and and we've got to do
[17:22.560 --> 17:26.360]  something about it so that they're preparing the public's minds for a new
[17:26.360 --> 17:31.400]  type of economic system which is to be introduced in different countries
[17:31.400 --> 17:37.120]  probably a starter in Europe and then eventually into America as a new economic
[17:37.120 --> 17:45.080]  system based on resources and taxation by consumption a value added tax will
[17:45.080 --> 17:51.080]  replace basically eventually eventually will place all other taxes and so you'll
[17:51.080 --> 17:57.280]  be kept at a certain minimum standard of living in a communitarian living area
[17:57.280 --> 18:02.800]  your region or your local area for communitarianism they've got it started
[18:02.800 --> 18:08.160]  off in Britain it's going down there and it's be introduced to into the states
[18:08.160 --> 18:13.000]  in fact they've just stopped the steam organization that started in Britain it's
[18:13.000 --> 18:20.320]  just launched their big movements in the US as well so it's it's it's a whole
[18:20.320 --> 18:25.600]  new way of living they call it scientific economy a scientifically
[18:25.600 --> 18:30.360]  designed run right down to your local level and what you do or what you're
[18:30.360 --> 18:34.360]  assigned to do with a new kind of job and when it can make people helpless
[18:34.360 --> 18:39.080]  enough with a bad economy the general public will will grab at any straw to
[18:39.080 --> 18:43.480]  deceive themselves well they also admit as you know that it's designed to shut
[18:43.480 --> 18:48.040]  things off that you will live at a lower standard the government publicly to kind
[18:48.040 --> 18:51.040]  of the unwashed masses as they see them so we're trying to make your life better
[18:51.040 --> 18:54.720]  but in all the public manuals and even public statements it's like we're gonna
[18:54.720 --> 18:58.800]  shut everything off from these people start euthanizing and and don't you
[18:58.800 --> 19:03.520]  like that slaves and the slaves go yeah we're trendy kill us we're trendy oh yeah

[19:28.200 --> 19:30.760]  going to break out I want you to continue along that line that they
[19:30.760 --> 19:33.600]  admitted all these handbooks we've shown them on air they teach it to the

[19:37.720 --> 19:40.880]  got to be removed but they really don't think it's a disease it's a disease to
[19:40.880 --> 19:44.560]  the globalist they don't want you having any sense of identity any real roots

[24:14.280 --> 24:21.400]  of NBC Los Angeles Russian genius live with 26 corpses some skeletal remains
[24:21.400 --> 24:26.080]  were reportedly dressed up as a doll and a teddy bear well I'm a better news
[24:26.080 --> 24:29.200]  rear when I'm totally tired so I get so excited normally I can't even read
[24:29.200 --> 24:34.320]  stuff a when I'm not burnout a Russian man who speaks 13 languages and
[24:34.320 --> 24:41.840]  lectured at museum head the corpses of 26 women in a small apartment and a
[24:41.840 --> 24:49.920]  totally mosque give 45 had dug up many of the mummified bodies from graves and
[24:49.920 --> 24:54.360]  some were dressed up and arranged around his three-room apartment in western
[24:54.360 --> 24:59.160]  Russia according to BNO news the bodies were discovered after his parents came
[24:59.160 --> 25:04.480]  for an unexpected visit I'm sorry it's just so sick I'm laughing as it's sick
[25:04.480 --> 25:10.320]  Russian imagine his parents walking in oh he's such a nice man see this is what
[25:10.320 --> 25:15.000]  government is like it's far worse than this right and as the and as the IQ goes
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.160]  up this gets even more common Russian media reportedly reported the bodies
[25:19.160 --> 25:27.000]  were females ages between 15 and 26 who died years ago but it goes on life news
[25:27.000 --> 25:31.440]  said that he's a historian who's sneaked into graveyards at night dug up
[25:31.440 --> 25:35.200]  bodies and took them home in plastic bags back in his apartment he dressed up
[25:35.200 --> 25:39.200]  the bodies as dolls wearing dresses and stockings that's actually a phenomenon
[25:39.200 --> 25:43.240]  I've seen cases of that in the US people there in love with corpses now
[25:43.240 --> 25:48.120]  skeletons actually but you know it's funny Alan this comes out they're
[25:48.120 --> 25:51.560]  calling this guy sick and I agree it's completely insane but the royal family
[25:51.560 --> 25:55.440]  it just came out has been you know recently not just Vlad the impaler days
[25:55.440 --> 26:00.600]  eating human body parts they said they believe it's nutritious which adds to
[26:00.600 --> 26:03.680]  all the lore this is a short segment long what's coming up but from your
[26:03.680 --> 26:07.680]  research of the British royal bloodline which German it's really Transylvanian
[26:07.680 --> 26:14.880]  and and and all of this why are so many of these elitist into this stuff it's
[26:14.880 --> 26:23.880]  an ancient myth or belief and regeneration basically especially if you
[26:23.880 --> 26:28.920]  get I mean we know in ancient times and probably into the Middle Ages they've
[26:28.920 --> 26:35.360]  actually collect the menstrual fluids of women and drink that bleeding it's
[26:35.360 --> 26:40.960]  restored youth to them the same thing is still going on in some circles today to
[26:40.960 --> 26:46.680]  do with the brother comes from the umbilical cord of babies and some
[26:46.680 --> 26:51.240]  circles are definitely still do that but that that was traditionally a royal thing
[26:51.240 --> 26:57.560]  to do and I was back all the way back to Egypt actually yeah here's what the
[26:57.560 --> 27:01.640]  commenters are saying they were actually Chicago registered voters the next one
[27:01.640 --> 27:04.440]  said everyone thinks this is funny and strange but here in Chicago these
[27:04.440 --> 27:08.320]  people these dead people would all be called voters other one says he wanted
[27:08.320 --> 27:13.200]  his mummy the other says what some guys will do to get a date how much lead time
[27:13.200 --> 27:17.360]  does one need to put away 26 corpses before mom and dad come to visit I mean
[27:17.360 --> 27:21.920]  again but this is seen as sick but when the royals are out of this stuff it's
[27:21.920 --> 27:28.600]  seen as loving mm-hmm yeah and we know we know too that you understand that
[27:28.600 --> 27:34.680]  cabala was very very high in the Middle Ages and especially in France and
[27:34.680 --> 27:39.000]  England too but in France they have found some of the paraphernalia they
[27:39.000 --> 27:44.680]  used in the royal courts during that time for the king and they found
[27:44.680 --> 27:51.040]  the skinned the skinned babies you know the skin of the babies were there that
[27:51.040 --> 27:56.560]  was again a rejuvenation thing if you wore the skin of a youth it and went
[27:56.560 --> 28:01.320]  through this ritual supposedly restored youth to them so they believed and of
[28:01.320 --> 28:04.840]  course the chalice for the blood and all the rest of it so they've always been
[28:04.840 --> 28:07.880]  into this kind of they've been fascinated with when you're up there in
[28:07.880 --> 28:12.720]  power you got nothing to go for but more power and immortality and this is
[28:12.720 --> 28:17.600]  part of the the capitalistic rituals they would end to right through and the
[28:17.600 --> 28:23.000]  king Louis the 16th yeah why why is Prince Charles now making such a big
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.840]  deal about he's a Transylvania and he's got a house there glad the impalers old
[28:26.840 --> 28:33.120]  house and he loves it on something but I wouldn't go too far with it but he I
[28:33.120 --> 28:39.880]  mean Charlie is an armscull too and he's really pretty stupid I mean even
[28:39.880 --> 28:43.760]  at school I talked to one of his headmasters once and he said the same
[28:43.760 --> 28:50.360]  thing to me and but the Charlie had no purpose for a long time he said that he
[28:50.360 --> 28:54.680]  has descended from David he said he was an Olympian from the old gods of the
[28:54.680 --> 29:00.520]  Olympics and as a secret society too and he was defender of faith the faith
[29:00.520 --> 29:03.520]  that was just Christian faith and he changed it to defender of all faiths
[29:03.520 --> 29:08.120]  and now he's trying to say that he's Transylvanian whether trying to make out
[29:08.120 --> 29:12.840]  is that their ancestors of our Saxon people or Prussian people that once
[29:12.840 --> 29:17.280]  dominated Transylvania Transylvania as well as one of their biggest states and
[29:17.280 --> 29:22.680]  we are up to the Sax Cobra Gotha or the three main houses they come from they
[29:22.680 --> 29:27.680]  were Prussian German states basically yeah they're all from the same family
[29:27.680 --> 29:34.640]  interbred and eventually in the 1800s and the early 1800s in fact the 18th
[29:34.640 --> 29:40.360]  century to say the gotten merchants very rich merchants and they became the
[29:40.360 --> 29:43.520]  dominant strain stay there we'll be right back stay right there on talk more

[34:33.920 --> 34:36.000]  what's going on with this for me a little bit of that flutter thing it does
[34:36.000 --> 34:39.520]  every once in a while or like distortion in my ear I'm not
[34:39.520 --> 34:42.320]  quite sure but I might check the board in there and see if something's been
[34:42.320 --> 34:46.560]  changed or perhaps it's in here there it stops I don't know people can hear that
[34:46.560 --> 34:54.720]  on air but we're gonna open the phones up to it's 800-259-9231-800-259-9231
[34:54.720 --> 34:57.760]  if you have any questions or comments for Ellen Watt
[34:57.760 --> 35:00.800]  Ellen the reason I keep going back to this is knowing the enemy knowing the
[35:00.800 --> 35:04.080]  global elite knowing what they're into obviously I don't believe there's real
[35:04.080 --> 35:07.600]  vampires running around people have archetypes for all of this where they
[35:07.600 --> 35:10.960]  could say it's vampires it's reptoids because you know we're saying
[35:10.960 --> 35:13.520]  me these aren't humans they don't act like humans
[35:13.520 --> 35:17.920]  psychopaths don't act like humans but really they're just I guess genetically
[35:17.920 --> 35:21.280]  different they don't have empathy in fact a lot of them enjoy
[35:21.280 --> 35:24.960]  hurting innocent people but is that from your research that's why every culture
[35:24.960 --> 35:29.280]  has these legends of vampires and stuff and because well in a lot of cultures
[35:29.280 --> 35:33.360]  it wasn't even I mean they were doing human sacrifice they were blood drinking
[35:33.360 --> 35:36.960]  and you study the elites they're obsessed with this and that's why they do the
[35:36.960 --> 35:41.280]  things that they're doing Ellen Watt
[35:41.280 --> 35:45.760]  well yeah it's a very primitive thing because way back into ancient times
[35:45.760 --> 35:49.280]  even when some of the tribes did did some still do in Africa
[35:49.280 --> 35:53.440]  drink the blood of the cattle as they move which is a more practical thing
[35:53.440 --> 35:57.360]  you understand that but of course when it comes into
[35:57.360 --> 36:02.720]  the psychopathic type they want to stun those they want to subdue they want to
[36:02.720 --> 36:08.080]  stun them by doing something which terrifies them and it wouldn't surprise
[36:08.080 --> 36:11.840]  me if they did this in ancient times publicly at times as well
[36:11.840 --> 36:15.920]  drinking the blood of humans or a sacrifice or something like that so
[36:15.920 --> 36:19.520]  but then again as I say in the middle ages you had the magic park coming
[36:19.520 --> 36:24.160]  into it from the eastern Europe and blending with it and that became very
[36:24.160 --> 36:28.720]  popular in the circles of royalty and up to the present time too that there's
[36:28.720 --> 36:33.360]  a lot of strange things to do I mean a psychopath has no inhibition
[36:33.360 --> 36:36.640]  could understand that doesn't matter what culture
[36:36.640 --> 36:41.600]  that they instill upon the people but they always put a culture on the people
[36:41.600 --> 36:45.200]  and had their managers to manage that culture today it's all sociologists that
[36:45.200 --> 36:48.560]  do it for us you know and psychologists neurologists and
[36:48.560 --> 36:52.320]  neuroscientists they call them so they give us the present culture
[36:52.320 --> 36:55.680]  they work with industry they work with the the media they work with all
[36:55.680 --> 36:59.280]  entertainers today and they have for a long long time
[36:59.280 --> 37:02.320]  so the psychopath himself doesn't follow that culture
[37:02.320 --> 37:06.160]  except in public for PR shots he'll seem fairly normal
[37:06.160 --> 37:11.600]  repeat scripts but in private life they have no inhibitions whatsoever
[37:11.600 --> 37:15.200]  the laws that apply to the general population never apply to them
[37:15.200 --> 37:19.760]  they're above the laws and they can get away they actually break a lot of laws
[37:19.760 --> 37:25.280]  and be in touch because you always find if you go into the law books
[37:25.280 --> 37:29.120]  royalty cannot be charged or fined for anything
[37:29.120 --> 37:32.960]  they're above all law they can only be tried by a peer group which is
[37:32.960 --> 37:38.480]  other members of royalty and that's why you get tried by a jury of your peers
[37:38.480 --> 37:42.480]  commoners are not the peers of royalty you see so they've a completely
[37:42.480 --> 37:45.760]  different way of doing things but there's nothing
[37:45.760 --> 37:51.280]  Eunice whatsoever there's a famous club in London
[37:51.280 --> 37:56.560]  that's still on the go I think and Lord Mount Batten used to take
[37:56.560 --> 38:00.160]  little boys you know underage boys into this club
[38:00.160 --> 38:03.120]  it was a lot of money to get in at the door like for a member so kept the
[38:03.120 --> 38:06.560]  public out of it some report many reporters actually from
[38:06.560 --> 38:09.680]  Fleet Street got in there and they'd often see Mount Batten
[38:09.680 --> 38:12.560]  sitting with a little boy and getting them piss drunk
[38:12.560 --> 38:18.080]  and going up to one of the rooms with them no one ever reported on that except
[38:18.080 --> 38:22.560]  one later on years ago actually he did by word of mouth but
[38:22.560 --> 38:26.640]  he couldn't report it in Fleet Street or it had been fined and charged
[38:26.640 --> 38:29.600]  the newspapers would be closed down actually if you actually published
[38:29.600 --> 38:32.720]  something like that so they're above all the things now
[38:32.720 --> 38:40.000]  Psychopath 2 really enjoys all sensations they flourish on
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.960]  sensations whoever drug turns them on gives them a
[38:42.960 --> 38:46.800]  better high whatever the more weird weirdest tinkiest
[38:46.800 --> 38:51.280]  sex they can possibly get gives them a better high
[38:51.280 --> 38:54.640]  that's what they live for is the highs in life and they jet all over the place
[38:54.640 --> 38:57.440]  to have their little orgies and things like that
[38:57.440 --> 39:03.120]  but of course that's just the nature of the psychopath
[39:03.120 --> 39:07.360]  lower level psychopaths have to put a better show on to the public
[39:07.360 --> 39:11.040]  pretend they're one of you but at the top royalty
[39:11.040 --> 39:14.560]  apart from the PR shots they live a completely different lifestyle that you
[39:14.560 --> 39:19.040]  can ever imagine and really that's what modern
[39:19.040 --> 39:25.520]  civilization has become is a psychopath playground
[39:25.520 --> 39:29.280]  and they've created the artificial culture the culture creators
[39:29.280 --> 39:33.920]  and more and more are trying to convert a large servant class over
[39:33.920 --> 39:38.400]  to not just do this ritually here and there but they want to go into mass scale
[39:38.400 --> 39:42.160]  war mass scale death you or i would look at the video
[39:42.160 --> 39:45.600]  of the three-year-old girl with her lower mandible blown off tongue hanging out
[39:45.600 --> 39:49.920]  and absolute panic and that rips our heart out rips our guts out
[39:49.920 --> 39:53.600]  uh and uh but the globalists for them that's beautiful
[39:53.600 --> 39:57.520]  that that's a sensation that is that is just grand
[39:57.520 --> 40:01.440]  and that's why they make the joke this is peace ha ha ha it's all about well
[40:01.440 --> 40:06.080]  there's been many many studies with a psychopath and have wired them up to
[40:06.080 --> 40:10.080]  various equipment to electrical equipment to to study their brain
[40:10.080 --> 40:13.920]  including the the electromagnetic imaging
[40:13.920 --> 40:17.840]  and um they can actually see what parts of the brain are stimulated
[40:17.840 --> 40:21.600]  or not or not even touched quite but look at different photographs
[40:21.600 --> 40:25.280]  psychopaths don't have a horror they don't have
[40:25.280 --> 40:30.080]  recoil with horror it's gruesome pictures there's a neutral
[40:30.080 --> 40:34.720]  image in the brain um sexual things something like that
[40:34.720 --> 40:38.400]  even torture might turn them on um but uh
[40:38.400 --> 40:43.440]  things which shock most people have has no uh i i feel that it responds well see
[40:43.440 --> 40:46.560]  see i mean i mean i believe it's it's healthy and normal
[40:46.560 --> 40:51.040]  to recoil from all that but then there's a place in good people
[40:51.040 --> 40:57.040]  where where i i wouldn't enjoy it but i do have a compulsion
[40:57.040 --> 41:01.040]  a compulsion you know in my mind that these people need to be
[41:01.040 --> 41:04.800]  routed out uh you know i'm somebody who doesn't like you wouldn't hurt a
[41:04.800 --> 41:10.240]  flea but when i see the globalist i have an overwhelming drive
[41:10.240 --> 41:14.880]  to see him hang high i mean i mean and of course that's a natural instinct
[41:14.880 --> 41:17.760]  they're trying to get that out of the general public so we'll just sit here
[41:17.760 --> 41:22.080]  and take it as a father as a human as a warrior as a guardian
[41:22.080 --> 41:25.600]  nothing special just i'm just a man i have absolute
[41:25.600 --> 41:29.280]  total energy even though i'm exhausted right now just thinking about these
[41:29.280 --> 41:32.480]  people to want to to to defeat them and i
[41:32.480 --> 41:36.320]  would imagine you have that same view as well oh yeah i mean
[41:36.320 --> 41:40.480]  you understand we have our figure heads that still have power like prince
[41:40.480 --> 41:44.320]  charles those articles recently where he can actually
[41:44.320 --> 41:48.960]  veto or just nullify any law that's going to affect him and his
[41:48.960 --> 41:52.000]  in fact let me stop you guys pull up london guardian
[41:52.000 --> 41:55.360]  headline prince charles offered vetoes i think it's 50 times
[41:55.360 --> 41:58.720]  but they admit oh he has a loophole where he runs everything he is still he's
[41:58.720 --> 42:03.040]  the ruler and he runs anything he wants is his and i tell
[42:03.040 --> 42:06.800]  canadiens this i go you know the queen suspended your parliament three times
[42:06.800 --> 42:10.880]  they go no you're a liar so i show articles and then they go well
[42:10.880 --> 42:14.640]  that's just ceremonial but but again i mean this is how it works
[42:14.640 --> 42:18.320]  go ahead well there's no law thing to be passed and any of the
[42:18.320 --> 42:22.560]  the british commonwealth countries australia new zealand canada
[42:22.560 --> 42:27.200]  uh britain uh even india still follows that they love those rules because they're
[42:27.200 --> 42:32.080]  part of the british commonwealth and so uh no law can be passed in those
[42:32.080 --> 42:36.480]  countries without without the final permission of the queen she must do the
[42:36.480 --> 42:42.000]  stamp it basically to pass it or or nullify it uh so that they're so very
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.800]  powerful but they also have that again their their
[42:44.800 --> 42:48.240]  pals their cousins too because they're interrelated with the big bankers
[42:48.240 --> 42:51.840]  they're intermarried with them uh like the big uh
[42:51.840 --> 42:56.320]  what i'm talking about bankers who lend to nations and so they're intermarried with
[42:56.320 --> 42:59.440]  those guys too they're all they're also in red psychopaths that
[42:59.440 --> 43:03.040]  have been at this for hundreds and hundreds of years
[43:03.040 --> 43:08.400]  and so uh we we have see everything runs from the top down by money
[43:08.400 --> 43:12.000]  and a bunch of money you can buy everything you buy countries because
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.960]  every country is in debt so you make sure of that by the system that you
[43:14.960 --> 43:18.400]  introduce and that the them that the guy who's
[43:18.400 --> 43:21.600]  in charge of money uh can can basically see well i'll give you
[43:21.600 --> 43:24.720]  this if you want to put so much to the military and he's a little
[43:24.720 --> 43:27.760]  deal like you know like your military to attack that country
[43:27.760 --> 43:30.240]  over there because they haven't been paying their debts no it's kind of
[43:30.240 --> 43:33.200]  stuff and this is how it really works that's why
[43:33.200 --> 43:36.240]  Rothschild said give me control of your money
[43:36.240 --> 43:40.640]  a system and i care not who rules the country because he knew from previous
[43:40.640 --> 43:44.160]  experience that whoever rules the money rules the whole
[43:44.160 --> 43:47.280]  country anyway and the prime minister the prime minister
[43:47.280 --> 43:52.960]  must go to to the banker uh for cap and hand every year for
[43:52.960 --> 43:57.360]  his uh good cash you know so money rules and they're
[43:57.360 --> 44:00.640]  to see the interbread psychopaths too and you find the Rothschilds are
[44:00.640 --> 44:05.200]  intermined with the royal families of britain and europe as well so
[44:05.200 --> 44:09.440]  so we're run by psychopaths on all levels some of the other ones too by the way
[44:09.440 --> 44:12.800]  it's interesting going to the military uh it is sure
[44:12.800 --> 44:16.160]  through the ranks naturally probably how they attended in fact but
[44:16.160 --> 44:19.600]  they end up being in charge in the top levels of military
[44:19.600 --> 44:24.160]  so there you have to have your your royal powers for ultimate laws
[44:24.160 --> 44:27.680]  you have your your financial industry boys there
[44:27.680 --> 44:31.440]  they govern the whole finance the whole country they use the people like peasants
[44:31.440 --> 44:35.600]  for taxation to fund their wars and their loans and the rest of it
[44:35.600 --> 44:39.440]  and then you have guys at the top of the military who are
[44:39.440 --> 44:44.720]  uh who decide to take you off to war so they have the little plans
[44:44.720 --> 44:48.080]  that really are secret plans from the public the public's never to know the
[44:48.080 --> 44:50.720]  real reasons for anything and they never do they're never told the real
[44:50.720 --> 44:54.640]  reasons for any war uh all the real reasons for anything
[44:54.640 --> 44:59.040]  happening within their country so the psychopaths really now said
[44:59.040 --> 45:03.280]  there's all people who are going to be in charge or get in power over any
[45:03.280 --> 45:07.440]  citizen that should be tested for psychopathy you got to start with that
[45:07.440 --> 45:11.840]  number one that rule real real for that and that goes to your money system and
[45:11.840 --> 45:15.920]  every other system there is because psychopaths once they get in
[45:15.920 --> 45:20.080]  they can cause so much damage so quickly and but and by the way
[45:20.080 --> 45:23.840]  they recognize each other they find each other very quickly
[45:23.840 --> 45:27.280]  they instantly recognize another psychopath and they form a little
[45:27.280 --> 45:33.600]  little societies that end up ruling uh big big chunks of the world
[45:33.600 --> 45:38.560]  where it comes from foreign relations they are a cancer and they must be
[45:38.560 --> 45:43.040]  routed out they are the you know the vampires not
[45:43.040 --> 45:46.400]  physical vampires but spiritually and they have to be routed
[45:46.400 --> 45:50.080]  or they will continue to feed on us look at this headline on a cbs news denver
[45:50.080 --> 45:53.680]  collects fines on drivers who stop at red lights
[45:53.680 --> 45:59.120]  and uh you know if their bumper just goes one inch over the white line again
[45:59.120 --> 46:03.280]  just but then but then the system can can commit any crimes they want
[46:03.280 --> 46:08.240]  um alan watt is our guest right now jessie ventura called me last night
[46:08.240 --> 46:12.080]  about the whole tsa thing and said he would try to call us after the press
[46:12.080 --> 46:15.200]  conference but we'll see what happens with that that that that's scheduled
[46:15.200 --> 46:18.560]  to happen around noon uh we're going to have alan watt with us till five
[46:18.560 --> 46:21.440]  after then jim mars is going to be popping in and look at the banking and
[46:21.440 --> 46:24.320]  the whole world the wars that are coming up in the rest of it i want to go to
[46:24.320 --> 46:29.120]  lauren patrick john lee and shantel and others that are
[46:29.120 --> 46:33.280]  wanting to talk to alan watt which is briefly alan what's your view on this
[46:33.280 --> 46:39.120]  whole iran situation well i i i was pretty certain that uh
[46:39.120 --> 46:43.040]  of how geopolitics is going to run this one and it has turned out this way
[46:43.040 --> 46:47.520]  i knew that israel would you see israel could have if you read the old
[46:47.520 --> 46:51.360]  newspapers from israel um you'll find that for the new american
[46:51.360 --> 46:54.880]  century prior to their list of countries they wanted to just take down
[46:54.880 --> 47:00.800]  they had afghanistan iraq syria they had libya they had they had uh
[47:00.800 --> 47:07.360]  iran egypt etc all on a list and of course obama is just following the same
[47:07.360 --> 47:11.840]  list he was even congratulated by romsfeld for doing so
[47:11.840 --> 47:16.720]  and so but but israel kept telling the us and the israeli papers
[47:16.720 --> 47:20.160]  um don't stop don't stop at this country keep going keep going
[47:20.160 --> 47:23.840]  they were really ticked off that the us wasn't going through them all one after
[47:23.840 --> 47:27.600]  another they had these long pauses in between so
[47:27.600 --> 47:31.200]  this time i thought well um israel will have to
[47:31.200 --> 47:34.400]  for the world for the appearance is sake it doesn't support as far as her
[47:34.400 --> 47:38.480]  appearance is sake um israel will come up and stand up and say
[47:38.480 --> 47:42.240]  we're going to attack and and then the media will come out and say that's
[47:42.240 --> 47:47.440]  putting pressure on the us who doesn't want a full scale attack on iran
[47:47.440 --> 47:51.760]  um and and therefore they'll they'll step up the sanctions they'll step up they'll
[47:51.760 --> 47:54.960]  take over and that's exactly how they're playing it out
[47:54.960 --> 47:59.760]  they get israel to come out first with a uh uh threatens a strike on iran
[47:59.760 --> 48:04.560]  and the us all will go step and say we're the protector we'll we'll we'll handle that
[48:04.560 --> 48:08.000]  and then the us takes the blame pays the cost of it
[48:08.000 --> 48:14.720]  uh financially and then blood as well and um and that's the whole region then
[48:14.720 --> 48:18.960]  cleared there's only one dominant country to be allowed
[48:18.960 --> 48:22.640]  in that whole region that was that was decided and talked about before they
[48:22.640 --> 48:26.800]  even set up the state of israel so you're simply watching a very old
[48:26.800 --> 48:31.760]  plan workouts on time on cue the way that they planned it
[48:31.760 --> 48:37.840]  yep let's go ahead and talk to john in wisconsin john you're on the air welcome
[48:37.840 --> 48:41.760]  hi uh it's a real pleasure to speak to you guys um obviously in four prison
[48:41.760 --> 48:44.160]  planet and cutting through the matrix their daily
[48:44.160 --> 48:47.120]  visits for me and most of the audience out there so i mean that's about as
[48:47.120 --> 48:51.440]  high a praise i could offer thank you um i i kind of want to change the subject
[48:51.440 --> 48:54.560]  just a little bit i i saw this movie recently about lime
[48:54.560 --> 48:57.680]  disease and just how it's spreading all over the place
[48:57.680 --> 49:01.440]  and the fact that there's a real ignorance as far as
[49:01.440 --> 49:06.800]  you know how to treat the disease and it seems like the medical establishment
[49:06.800 --> 49:09.520]  through their publishing and and through all their
[49:09.520 --> 49:13.600]  indoctrination has all these doctors under wraps you know and
[49:13.600 --> 49:17.840]  i i kind of wonder if they have it it's like this giant you know moving court of
[49:17.840 --> 49:21.280]  you know infected deer and infected ticks that they're controlling through the
[49:21.280 --> 49:25.920]  dnr and i mean how integrated is all this uh well we know lime
[49:25.920 --> 49:31.040]  disease it is pretty much on record um deer swam from plum island over to
[49:31.040 --> 49:34.720]  new york it's less than a mile deer do that and it was a
[49:34.720 --> 49:37.680]  zoological weapons base they brought nazis over
[49:37.680 --> 49:41.760]  there after world war two it's on record and so lime disease is a souped up
[49:41.760 --> 49:46.880]  weaponized system and uh yeah it's all part of their degenerative
[49:46.880 --> 49:50.640]  disease weapon program and then they just shelve and then don't cover under
[49:50.640 --> 49:53.840]  insurance all the real treatments for things alan
[49:53.840 --> 49:58.800]  as i feel older it was it was invented in canada during world war two
[49:58.800 --> 50:02.000]  and uh there's a good book out there is called uh
[50:02.000 --> 50:07.040]  deadly allies can't canada's secret war canada has led the field and by
[50:07.040 --> 50:10.640]  tiering viral warfare during and since world war two
[50:10.640 --> 50:14.080]  i knew about that but the word i got the but the main spread point they said
[50:14.080 --> 50:17.760]  was they particularly weaponized it even more at plum island
[50:17.760 --> 50:21.520]  they sent it down to plum island and the states to be worked on
[50:21.520 --> 50:26.720]  and uh and uh and and the vector that they chose was of course uh at the time
[50:26.720 --> 50:30.480]  it was ticks they dropped it from planes at one point across the western
[50:30.480 --> 50:34.800]  part of canada onto deer herds to see how it would spread and then spread amongst
[50:34.800 --> 50:37.600]  the populations and then eventually of course um
[50:37.600 --> 50:40.960]  they've actually weaponized it now it's been in the papers in canada
[50:40.960 --> 50:45.120]  that mosquitoes can carry it now as well so they're just going to dole out all
[50:45.120 --> 50:48.160]  this in a loving way to kill you and your family your children
[50:48.160 --> 50:52.720]  you know they love degenerative diseases so it's another little loving

[51:03.840 --> 51:07.920]  a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[51:07.920 --> 51:11.920]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[51:11.920 --> 51:15.280]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[51:15.280 --> 51:18.160]  it's true total government control of electricity
[51:18.160 --> 51:21.760]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[51:21.760 --> 51:25.360]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[51:25.360 --> 51:29.280]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem

[55:18.560 --> 55:22.720]  limes disease which you can go research is a
[55:22.720 --> 55:28.000]  bio weapon and that's just all part of the nastiness of the globalist
[55:28.000 --> 55:31.040]  do you think you guys know if there's like a correlation between chronic
[55:31.040 --> 55:34.400]  wasting disease and lime disease is that sort of the same
[55:34.400 --> 55:37.600]  condition or yeah there's all sorts of little carrier
[55:37.600 --> 55:42.800]  weapons they can put into ticks uh and other systems and now bill gates has
[55:42.800 --> 55:46.160]  said they're releasing the mosquitoes that are genetically engineered they'll
[55:46.160 --> 55:48.000]  put whatever they want in them and they're going to give it to you and
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.880]  that's the way it is because he's smiling and dances around and we're all
[55:50.880 --> 55:54.320]  trained if it's an authority figure they can kill us and that's just how it
[55:54.320 --> 55:57.200]  works you know they you know they want to control the
[55:57.200 --> 56:00.160]  hinterland so that you know any rebels that are gathering will just die of some
[56:00.160 --> 56:03.360]  kind of disease because they've been infected and it's even more than that
[56:03.360 --> 56:07.520]  you're you're on right track though uh yes there's been a big scare here a few
[56:07.520 --> 56:12.560]  years ago and ever i am uh at this the whole northern area
[56:12.560 --> 56:17.440]  and they tried to say that um not just limes disease but also the
[56:17.440 --> 56:21.200]  various other diseases spread by mosquitoes whereas it was on the way
[56:21.200 --> 56:25.600]  and uh that everybody terrified people were wearing full jackets of the mesh
[56:25.600 --> 56:28.640]  you know the mosquito mesh uh of eating dark
[56:28.640 --> 56:32.560]  gardeners were wearing them they're terrified um hey it's even in mainstream
[56:32.560 --> 56:36.560]  news allen interrupt you because you was maybe that um
[56:36.560 --> 56:41.520]  that uh west nile came out of uh a government weapon program sorry go
[56:41.520 --> 56:44.240]  ahead yeah yeah and and that can i fizzle the way
[56:44.240 --> 56:47.600]  that one and terrify people too but but you start to get
[56:47.600 --> 56:51.040]  the impression it's just not safe to live in the country anymore and of course
[56:51.040 --> 56:54.240]  what they'll do and what they have been doing is well we can actually spray and
[56:54.240 --> 56:58.080]  keep down the mosquitoes around cities uh but we can of course spray
[56:58.080 --> 57:03.200]  outside of the cities and etc etc so everything now is to get everyone in
[57:03.200 --> 57:06.720]  off of the rural areas that's all part of the big agenda written in lots of
[57:06.720 --> 57:10.560]  different programs uh into the big cities for the
[57:10.560 --> 57:14.000]  community and lifestyle so we're going to be watched tracked and traced as much
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.720]  cheaper for them to watch us when we're all collectively stuck
[57:16.720 --> 57:19.040]  together and crammed together and by the way
[57:19.040 --> 57:22.160]  it's all on record that our government other governments
[57:22.160 --> 57:26.160]  sterilizing people killing foster children pesticides
[57:26.160 --> 57:28.960]  half of the native kids they get their hands on die
[57:28.960 --> 57:34.400]  in canada mainstream news uh and and biological chemical radiological
[57:34.400 --> 57:38.560]  injecting people with syphilis polio i mean the governments have been caught
[57:38.560 --> 57:41.760]  thousands of times doing this radiating little children
[57:41.760 --> 57:44.720]  and people are like but it's the government don't be anti-government
[57:44.720 --> 57:49.360]  love your psychopaths hand your guns in wouldn't they want to help you
[57:49.360 --> 57:53.200]  the troops need to use du which kills them but it takes 20 years it's be
[57:53.200 --> 57:57.280]  patriotic let the troops be killed by the government
[57:57.280 --> 58:01.440]  and remember too that uh you're quite right we're under it
[58:01.440 --> 58:04.800]  she could keep asking me all the time when is this all going to start i see
[58:04.800 --> 58:09.120]  what it's already started since the 50s onwards the cancer rates have just
[58:09.120 --> 58:12.640]  massively exploded there's no and there's no
[58:12.640 --> 58:16.480]  panic about it by the way but there's no panic about it that means it's under
[58:16.480 --> 58:19.840]  their control they're behind it all the big boys
[58:19.840 --> 58:22.720]  they know it's causing it because they made sure they gave us all the products
[58:22.720 --> 58:25.520]  the injections and so on they do cause it
[58:25.520 --> 58:29.680]  so uh they're exploding and an article recently from the world health
[58:29.680 --> 58:33.360]  organization said the third world countries were now bringing up to a
[58:33.360 --> 58:37.040]  higher standard of living through the gap treaty and the world trade

[1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:43.200]  uh alan wants our guests i could talk to him for 10 hours but another
[1:00:43.200 --> 1:00:48.080]  informative person good friend of mine jim mars is coming up here in a moment
[1:00:48.080 --> 1:00:50.800]  uh and i and i want to try to go to a few more calls
[1:00:50.800 --> 1:00:54.560]  uh we'll go to all these regardless it's just it's a question you're gonna be
[1:00:54.560 --> 1:01:00.000]  talking to on air uh but uh you know there's got to be
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:03.600]  some way to get people out of their trance because
[1:01:03.600 --> 1:01:06.400]  i mean i understand this is frightening information but it's all
[1:01:06.400 --> 1:01:11.040]  verifiable i mean do people it'd be funny i mean if i went over in somebody's
[1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:15.120]  yard and if they had a bunch of pebbles or gravel in their yard
[1:01:15.120 --> 1:01:17.840]  you know one of these zero escape things and i took a rock out of their yard
[1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:23.120]  the neighbor would run out and bow up um
[1:01:23.120 --> 1:01:27.920]  and you know i get all crazy but if the government murders them
[1:01:27.920 --> 1:01:32.320]  20 30 years young or kills their kid with a cancer injection
[1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:35.520]  it's like they don't want to hear it it's like they don't even care it's like
[1:01:35.520 --> 1:01:40.240]  kill me i mean it's like almost fun to toadie around and like the government
[1:01:40.240 --> 1:01:45.040]  and like the psa is and all of it and thank you for groping me tsa
[1:01:45.040 --> 1:01:48.400]  you know just all of this it's it's it's it's mind control
[1:01:48.400 --> 1:01:54.080]  is it not ellen it is mind control but it's also propaganda it's the effect
[1:01:54.080 --> 1:01:59.120]  of mass propaganda of the authoritative uh system
[1:01:59.120 --> 1:02:03.120]  versus those who have not been given authority
[1:02:03.120 --> 1:02:06.640]  by government or whatever they want to believe in government they want to
[1:02:06.640 --> 1:02:10.960]  believe that people could never be so awful and terrible and nasty to them
[1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:14.560]  and uh the propaganda is perfect for every culture that gives you
[1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:17.760]  the guys at the top that say the traditional phrases that you're used to
[1:02:17.760 --> 1:02:20.240]  hearing and those are your they could never do
[1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:25.120]  things like that to you they're caring etc they fall for all the pr they fall
[1:02:25.120 --> 1:02:28.400]  for all the deportment these guys are taught and the scripts the
[1:02:28.400 --> 1:02:33.600]  scripts are written by professionals um that they fall for propaganda this is
[1:02:33.600 --> 1:02:37.600]  a this is a propaganda war we're in this information war
[1:02:37.600 --> 1:02:40.640]  and this is what they said they would come before they gave us the internet
[1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:44.560]  they said there will be a massive information war and of course it didn't
[1:02:44.560 --> 1:02:47.840]  sit back and wait for it happening they made sure they had they had the biggest
[1:02:47.840 --> 1:02:51.920]  most professional well funded teams to to make sure but it always have
[1:02:51.920 --> 1:02:55.360]  information wars even on the other side too
[1:02:55.360 --> 1:03:00.240]  this has been fakes over the years who've come out on the patriot side
[1:03:00.240 --> 1:03:03.440]  and later we find out like both rights that they're actually
[1:03:03.440 --> 1:03:09.600]  still working for the government so um this is a real war a real war for the
[1:03:09.600 --> 1:03:12.720]  mind when the mind goes they're at the bodies you know the body's no chance
[1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:16.640]  no choice but to follow it so there's a war for the mind
[1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:22.720]  and until people literally become informed and in paranoid about their
[1:03:22.720 --> 1:03:25.600]  governments nothing will happen the majority will go along with the
[1:03:25.600 --> 1:03:29.200]  unfortunately and now you have the big propaganda push through
[1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:32.960]  conspiracy theories conspiracy theories and it was the main line
[1:03:32.960 --> 1:03:36.800]  to put that term out there and now now everyone's labeled the conspiracy
[1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:39.680]  theorist like some kind of nuts like the guy that collects
[1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:43.040]  collects corpses there instead of stamps i think so
[1:03:43.040 --> 1:03:48.160]  that's how they label you so a phrase can literally knock you out of action
[1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:51.760]  because it's already embedded in the people's mind through propaganda
[1:03:51.760 --> 1:03:55.760]  just like nazi it shuts them up right away there's no response to it
[1:03:55.760 --> 1:04:00.560]  there's no reasoning through logic it happens yeah amazing alan thank you

[1:10:23.040 --> 1:10:27.760]  and the federal court just threw it out and said it was the wrong federal court
[1:10:27.760 --> 1:10:31.280]  i mean his lawyer checked all that it's just a total punt
[1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:36.160]  so it's not a complete defeat though i i i think you should refile it
[1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:39.680]  in that court and and just continue it when you know first you don't succeed
[1:10:39.680 --> 1:10:42.320]  try try again jesse's given a press conference right now we've been able to
[1:10:42.320 --> 1:10:46.240]  find it unable to find it in the media he called me last night
[1:10:46.240 --> 1:10:49.840]  and said that he wouldn't try to call in after the press conference that could be
[1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:54.800]  anytime jim mars of course best-selling author researcher
[1:10:54.800 --> 1:10:59.120]  the first person to teach a college level course on jfk

[1:11:13.680 --> 1:11:18.480]  for about 10 minutes give them a a breather and then bring jesse on he's
[1:11:18.480 --> 1:11:23.520]  got the hotline number and so that's going on
[1:11:23.520 --> 1:11:26.480]  obviously uh man last night he was calling me saying you know what do you
[1:11:26.480 --> 1:11:30.240]  think about this and i had a guest on alfred dask i saw it was jesse calling
[1:11:30.240 --> 1:11:33.200]  something they're talking to him alfred's talking and i'm like uh
[1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:37.440]  i'm like well because you know then it was it had been thrown out then i saw
[1:11:37.440 --> 1:11:40.400]  the judge just said it was the wrong venues that's not
[1:11:40.400 --> 1:11:43.760]  it's technically it's thrown out but it's not really thrown out so i don't know
[1:11:43.760 --> 1:11:46.480]  what jesse's gonna do but it's a big deal because it's the fight against this
[1:11:46.480 --> 1:11:50.080]  national Gestapo force now rolling out on the streets before we get into all
[1:11:50.080 --> 1:11:54.240]  these issues of iran occupied wall street the new world order all the
[1:11:54.240 --> 1:11:57.360]  things that jim wants to get into jim what what do you think of the
[1:11:57.360 --> 1:12:00.960]  the morning this was going on 13 years ago it's in my film
[1:12:00.960 --> 1:12:05.280]  police day 2000 from 12 years ago but i i knew about it 13 years ago saw the
[1:12:05.280 --> 1:12:09.360]  federal grants street lights that have cameras and microphones hidden in them
[1:12:09.360 --> 1:12:13.280]  uh power transformers that have them hidden in them smart meters can actually
[1:12:13.280 --> 1:12:16.400]  with an algorithm tell what you're watching on tv that was mainstream news
[1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:20.160]  yesterday they're connecting to him 10 000 times a day
[1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:23.280]  they're now putting switches in all the new appliances that
[1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:27.360]  that data over power actually couples with and then
[1:12:27.360 --> 1:12:30.960]  and then tracks you in the house i mean this is beyond orwell
[1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:35.040]  uh tsa are now coming out on the streets they've got psas running in hotels
[1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:38.720]  saying spy on everybody they're not running video psas where it shows tsa at
[1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:42.960]  football games and at hotels and just everyone being searched
[1:12:42.960 --> 1:12:46.720]  lined up everywhere total prison i mean this is even crazier than i thought
[1:12:46.720 --> 1:12:50.960]  it would be and moving so quickly jim uh do you think the globalists are doing
[1:12:50.960 --> 1:12:53.840]  this because they're scared i mean because i've never seen them move the
[1:12:53.840 --> 1:12:57.840]  timetable so fast oh absolutely i think the new
[1:12:57.840 --> 1:13:02.560]  world order is coming apart at the seams but before we continue that let me
[1:13:02.560 --> 1:13:08.720]  just say if jessie ben turrick comes in i'll be more than happy to jump off and
[1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:13.120]  let's do what he says because i for one am quite grateful to his suit
[1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:18.080]  against the tsa uh because uh it's about time somebody does something we
[1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:22.960]  hadn't a great opportunity in texas uh a lot of your listeners may not know
[1:13:22.960 --> 1:13:27.600]  this or may not remember this but the texas house
[1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:34.560]  actually voted on a bill that would provide for a prison term and
[1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:40.400]  and a hefty fine for any tsa officer that uh touched your genitals okay
[1:13:40.400 --> 1:13:45.520]  and 30 of the 31 senators were all set to sign it and even that new world order
[1:13:45.520 --> 1:13:50.160]  stooge rick perry uh had indicated he would sign the bill
[1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:54.080]  and then the justice department came in and said oh well if the
[1:13:54.080 --> 1:13:59.120]  tsa can't guarantee flights in texas then we'll just uh cancel all flights in
[1:13:59.120 --> 1:14:03.760]  texas in other words turn texas into a no fly zone
[1:14:03.760 --> 1:14:08.720]  okay and of course thanks and thanks to the lieutenant governor and the
[1:14:08.720 --> 1:14:12.560]  governor they immediately caved to their new world order bosses
[1:14:12.560 --> 1:14:16.080]  but uh and so they withdrew the legislation
[1:14:16.080 --> 1:14:20.640]  but what an opportunity we should have said yeah go ahead and declare texas
[1:14:20.640 --> 1:14:24.560]  the no fly zone and we'll just stop tax revenues here and
[1:14:24.560 --> 1:14:27.840]  not send them to washington we'll cut off your money supply
[1:14:27.840 --> 1:14:31.840]  how do you like that but of course their weak need and
[1:14:31.840 --> 1:14:37.440]  and they're paid for uh the solution as you will know alex would be to
[1:14:37.440 --> 1:14:42.000]  elect people at a local level particularly the local county sheriff
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:46.560]  who by tradition and by law is the highest law enforcement
[1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:52.320]  officer uh you know in the land and there have but there are a bunch of
[1:14:52.320 --> 1:14:57.200]  courageous sheriffs uh as you will know go taking part in
[1:14:57.200 --> 1:15:00.560]  in trying to protect the freedom in this country there's
[1:15:00.560 --> 1:15:04.400]  i know there was one up in i want to say montana
[1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:08.400]  who publicly stated that if any federal officials came in
[1:15:08.400 --> 1:15:12.320]  and violated the constitution of the united states or the constitution of the
[1:15:12.320 --> 1:15:15.840]  state that his deputies would escort them to the border
[1:15:15.840 --> 1:15:19.760]  and we need to have more like that and we need to start standing up at the local
[1:15:19.760 --> 1:15:23.760]  level and just say no but back to your
[1:15:23.760 --> 1:15:27.920]  thought i'm in total agreement i think they are scared to death that's why
[1:15:27.920 --> 1:15:32.480]  they're tightening down and and it may be suicidal
[1:15:32.480 --> 1:15:36.320]  alex because the more they tighten down the more people wake up and the more
[1:15:36.320 --> 1:15:39.440]  people bow their back and say no wait a minute
[1:15:39.440 --> 1:15:45.600]  stop that and so it's it's an escalating type thing
[1:15:47.760 --> 1:15:52.720]  jim where do you see all this going i mean you say you think the new
[1:15:52.720 --> 1:15:56.080]  lord is in trouble i think they are i don't think they're invincible
[1:15:56.080 --> 1:15:59.280]  i mean they've got all their plans laid but i mean people are waking up to them
[1:15:59.280 --> 1:16:03.360]  why do you say the new world order is in trouble well uh well because as you
[1:16:03.360 --> 1:16:08.000]  yourself said it's all escalating it's all uh they're tightening down harder
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:12.960]  faster more openly i mean this has been they've been in stealth mode
[1:16:12.960 --> 1:16:18.000]  uh for at least a hundred years uh moving with their new world order
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:23.200]  and now that now the gloves are off uh i mean look at what's happening with
[1:16:23.200 --> 1:16:26.960]  economy look at what's happening with the european union
[1:16:26.960 --> 1:16:32.240]  uh the greek prime minister first he says oh well we'll have a referendum and
[1:16:32.240 --> 1:16:35.200]  then he says no we won't have a referendum and then i think they
[1:16:35.200 --> 1:16:39.040]  finally said no we're not going to do that because he's in the pocket of the
[1:16:39.040 --> 1:16:43.520]  international bankers but uh and of course prime minister in
[1:16:43.520 --> 1:16:47.840]  england he won't allow a referendum so wait a minute people begin to wake up
[1:16:47.840 --> 1:16:51.440]  and say well wait a minute if we're free people why can't we vote
[1:16:51.440 --> 1:16:55.680]  on what we want to do you know for example and we see the same thing in
[1:16:55.680 --> 1:17:00.320]  this country with all the economic problems we've had and with all the
[1:17:00.320 --> 1:17:04.640]  stuff that's going on with wall street when when when is the public ever had
[1:17:04.640 --> 1:17:07.360]  a chance to vote on whether we wanted to have the tarp
[1:17:07.360 --> 1:17:11.760]  bailout or whether we wanted to send 14 trillion dollars over to
[1:17:11.760 --> 1:17:16.000]  prop up foreign banks when do we get a chance to vote on this it makes a
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:21.520]  mockery of the whole concept of democracy doesn't it
[1:17:21.520 --> 1:17:25.760]  it does and we even see msnbc and bloomberg only channel saying it's bad
[1:17:25.760 --> 1:17:28.960]  the germans might not vote for this we need to get rid of freedom we need to
[1:17:28.960 --> 1:17:32.720]  get rid of their right to vote i mean it's just like open
[1:17:32.720 --> 1:17:37.360]  it is and and and you know when you start talking about the technical
[1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:42.560]  details the financial details of derivatives and things like that
[1:17:42.560 --> 1:17:46.480]  most people that they're eyes closed over because we're just you know it's all
[1:17:46.480 --> 1:17:51.840]  we can do to just to pay our uh light bills but when you start talking about
[1:17:51.840 --> 1:17:58.000]  do you get a chance to vote or not that's pretty understandable isn't it
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:01.360]  well it's just getting crazier and crazier and crazier
[1:18:01.360 --> 1:18:05.200]  um let's start getting a little bit of occupy wall street i mean it's coming
[1:18:05.200 --> 1:18:09.920]  out now that they basically called out a crowd well many people showed up
[1:18:09.920 --> 1:18:13.120]  the sorrows folks tried to coauth it now they admit acorns there but it didn't
[1:18:13.120 --> 1:18:16.640]  work very well in my view yeah that's true
[1:18:16.640 --> 1:18:21.520]  uh but the the thing in new york is interesting too because that uh
[1:18:21.520 --> 1:18:26.160]  park that they're in uh has recently just gotten a big
[1:18:26.160 --> 1:18:31.520]  the company that owns it has gotten a big grant from the obama administration
[1:18:31.520 --> 1:18:36.080]  and so in other words it's like and of course the obama himself is more or
[1:18:36.080 --> 1:18:39.440]  less sympathized with this so we can see wait a minute
[1:18:39.440 --> 1:18:43.840]  what's happening here here are people protesting the establishment and the
[1:18:43.840 --> 1:18:46.720]  leader of the establishment says we're all for you
[1:18:46.720 --> 1:18:51.120]  doesn't that that should ring some bells with somebody
[1:18:51.120 --> 1:18:55.760]  but again this is uh uh this is the thing where
[1:18:55.760 --> 1:18:59.120]  you have to go back and understand who's really in charge and who's really in
[1:18:59.120 --> 1:19:04.000]  charge of these people who uh inhabit these secret societies like
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:07.120]  yourself and went out to bohemian grove and you
[1:19:07.120 --> 1:19:10.320]  understand totally and i think most of your listeners understand what i'm
[1:19:10.320 --> 1:19:13.840]  talking about and uh you know this goes back and of
[1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:19.200]  course uh you know one of their key motos is order out of chaos
[1:19:19.200 --> 1:19:24.320]  well to promote order out of chaos first you have to create chaos and that's
[1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:28.240]  what they're doing right now jim i want to take phone

[1:24:46.160 --> 1:24:50.160]  you know i don't understand the globalist they're expert psychological warfare
[1:24:50.160 --> 1:24:54.080]  experts that's been proven but at the same time
[1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:57.120]  they study populations but they're pushing and pushing
[1:24:57.120 --> 1:25:01.120]  it's getting the sheep more into line but but for large segments of the public
[1:25:01.120 --> 1:25:04.480]  it's just enraging people and really getting them moving
[1:25:04.480 --> 1:25:08.000]  but i guess that happens throughout history but getting back to
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:11.760]  i was asking you before the break what's what's big on your radar screen jim
[1:25:11.760 --> 1:25:15.360]  well this is november after all and i know that
[1:25:15.360 --> 1:25:19.760]  you and i have both had that long-standing interest in the
[1:25:19.760 --> 1:25:24.320]  assassination of president johnny kennedy so i've been going back and digging
[1:25:24.320 --> 1:25:29.600]  up through some of the details some of the things that can get lost in the
[1:25:29.600 --> 1:25:33.920]  the whole thing uh as you'll recall one of the big arguments they made was
[1:25:33.920 --> 1:25:39.200]  they said that lee harvey oswald who was accused of being the assassin
[1:25:39.200 --> 1:25:43.440]  and i say accused because he was never got a fair trial never got a fair
[1:25:43.440 --> 1:25:46.960]  hearing never was convicted of anything in fact
[1:25:46.960 --> 1:25:52.000]  warrant commission heard secret testimony cherry picking their evidence
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:56.320]  and behind closed doors refused to let anyone represent
[1:25:56.320 --> 1:26:02.000]  oswald uh in a legal sense and uh then came out and said well uh we think he
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:07.280]  did it and acted alone uh or as juror ford hallways said
[1:26:07.280 --> 1:26:12.560]  over and over and over again we could find no evidence of conspiracy well no
[1:26:12.560 --> 1:26:15.040]  they couldn't because they didn't allow anything that's
[1:26:15.040 --> 1:26:19.360]  active conspiracy in there but one of the key things they used quite
[1:26:19.360 --> 1:26:23.440]  effectively was that oswald was accused of shooting a dallas
[1:26:23.440 --> 1:26:29.120]  policeman jd tippett uh had uh out south oak cliff at the
[1:26:29.120 --> 1:26:33.520]  near the intersection of tent the patent and the argument went well
[1:26:33.520 --> 1:26:37.280]  if he hadn't shot the president then why did he shoot the cop
[1:26:37.280 --> 1:26:42.080]  and so he shot the cop so therefore he must have shot the president
[1:26:42.080 --> 1:26:46.240]  well i think i could prove to any reasonable
[1:26:46.240 --> 1:26:49.840]  open minded person that oswald did not shoot the cop
[1:26:49.840 --> 1:26:54.080]  so now we can reverse the argument and say well he didn't shoot the cop
[1:26:54.080 --> 1:26:58.240]  maybe he didn't shoot the president and the way i can prove he didn't shoot
[1:26:58.240 --> 1:27:04.960]  officer tippett is pretty simple uh in years past in my book crossfire the
[1:27:04.960 --> 1:27:10.160]  plot to kill kennedy i uh pointed to three separate witnesses
[1:27:10.160 --> 1:27:15.520]  um an insurance salesman uh a young boy who is now a dallas
[1:27:15.520 --> 1:27:19.840]  the manager that sort was a few years ago named jack davis and
[1:27:19.840 --> 1:27:24.720]  which burrows the assistant manager of the texas theater
[1:27:24.720 --> 1:27:28.160]  all of them told me that they encountered
[1:27:28.160 --> 1:27:34.480]  lee harvey oswald who was arrested in the texas theater about 130 uh no later
[1:27:34.480 --> 1:27:39.360]  than just a few minutes after one officer tippett was shot about 150
[1:27:39.360 --> 1:27:44.640]  110 or 115 blocks away at tent the patent so in other words
[1:27:44.640 --> 1:27:47.760]  there are three separate witnesses who placed oswald
[1:27:47.760 --> 1:27:51.200]  in the theater at the time officer tippett was shot
[1:27:51.200 --> 1:27:54.320]  so obviously he can't be in two places at the same time
[1:27:54.320 --> 1:27:57.760]  so he was not at tent the patent shoot the cop
[1:27:57.760 --> 1:28:02.000]  now well so why did they believe he did it well there was another dallas
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:06.720]  policeman named jm poe and uh poe arrived at the scene of the
[1:28:06.720 --> 1:28:11.920]  tippet shooting and was given some showcases uh that the witnesses had
[1:28:11.920 --> 1:28:15.360]  picked up off the ground that they said had been left behind
[1:28:15.360 --> 1:28:19.680]  by the killer of officer tippett officer poe
[1:28:19.680 --> 1:28:24.080]  being a good trained police officer scratched his initials
[1:28:24.080 --> 1:28:32.080]  jmp in the shell in the brass shell cases and uh that there was the evidence
[1:28:32.080 --> 1:28:37.440]  and yet in the spring of 1964 when the warrant commission called him up
[1:28:37.440 --> 1:28:42.960]  showed him the shell cases he could not find his initials on those shell cases
[1:28:42.960 --> 1:28:47.040]  so in other words the shell casings that they present to us today
[1:28:47.040 --> 1:28:50.560]  is the evidence and they're still in the national archive
[1:28:50.560 --> 1:28:54.800]  and they say these are the shell cases from lee harvey oswald's 38
[1:28:54.800 --> 1:28:58.480]  caliber pistol that he used to kill officer tippett
[1:28:58.480 --> 1:29:03.120]  are not the same shell cases that they found at the scene of the shooting
[1:29:03.120 --> 1:29:08.960]  and i could further prove that because oswald had a 38 special
[1:29:08.960 --> 1:29:16.720]  which was a uh it it was a 38 smith and wesson 38 standard pistol but it had
[1:29:16.720 --> 1:29:23.360]  been rechambered to accept 38 special ammunition now the 38 special ammunition
[1:29:23.360 --> 1:29:30.000]  is has a little bit longer than the normal uh shells bullet
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:33.520]  and but it holds more power powder so it has more power
[1:29:33.520 --> 1:29:36.800]  finish up with that on the other side but i mean look you're getting into
[1:29:36.800 --> 1:29:40.480]  important minutiae that proves this but i mean i've talked to the undertaker guy
[1:29:40.480 --> 1:29:45.040]  where they came in and put the ink on oswald's hand and put the gun in i mean
[1:29:45.040 --> 1:29:49.440]  it's just ridiculous the whole thing and now we have all these insiders going
[1:29:49.440 --> 1:29:54.160]  public we're on the march the empires on the run

[1:33:34.720 --> 1:33:38.320]  after the press conference but who knows what's going to be going on
[1:33:38.320 --> 1:33:42.000]  and it was scheduled for noon stuff like that usually starts late
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:45.040]  i don't know he's pretty wound up you might talk for an hour who knows
[1:33:45.040 --> 1:33:49.280]  but we're looking for that call to come in um jim mars again running shotgun
[1:33:49.280 --> 1:33:52.160]  with us paul watson coming in i got a bunch of geopolitical news i'll be
[1:33:52.160 --> 1:33:57.440]  also smattering in here but before i go any further
[1:33:57.440 --> 1:34:01.200]  why are we having the money bomb well why did we build this studio
[1:34:01.200 --> 1:34:04.720]  and the tv studio and hire reporters and crew
[1:34:04.720 --> 1:34:09.600]  and it people and everything else we're launching here and trying to finish
[1:34:09.600 --> 1:34:13.520]  the social network and really have a quality one and all the other projects
[1:34:13.520 --> 1:34:19.200]  we're trying to get done here um we're not funded by the globalist
[1:34:19.200 --> 1:34:22.880]  we're not funded by the new world order we're funded by you
[1:34:22.880 --> 1:34:27.040]  buying the books the videos
[1:34:33.520 --> 1:34:40.160]  now uh continuing here i um
[1:34:41.600 --> 1:34:46.480]  we've gone up to the 300 000 which sounds like a lot but when you're hiring
[1:34:46.480 --> 1:34:50.320]  crew and buying equipment really the tv equipment we need
[1:34:50.320 --> 1:34:54.960]  even the moderate grade stuff some 150 000 or so
[1:34:54.960 --> 1:34:59.600]  uh i've spent i just got to be more than a million dollars of equipment here
[1:34:59.600 --> 1:35:03.200]  right now and uh then crew members and
[1:35:03.200 --> 1:35:06.480]  things like that and i want to thank all of you that
[1:35:06.480 --> 1:35:10.800]  have donated but i'm quite frankly very exhausted so i can't
[1:35:10.800 --> 1:35:15.200]  really express the whole spectrum of reasons but
[1:35:15.200 --> 1:35:19.280]  the globalists take your money at gunpoint because if you don't pay it
[1:35:19.280 --> 1:35:22.800]  they're coming with guns so it's a gunpoint that's implied
[1:35:22.800 --> 1:35:26.480]  and it's carried out uh we're here just saying by the books by the videos
[1:35:26.480 --> 1:35:28.880]  donate to the money bomb if you want to see us expand and you like what we're
[1:35:28.880 --> 1:35:33.280]  doing and folks have responded to that we're also a platform for ron paul and
[1:35:33.280 --> 1:35:36.080]  and all these other authors and researchers and we try to support their
[1:35:36.080 --> 1:35:40.320]  work that's why it's such an important juncture in the global awakening and i'm
[1:35:40.320 --> 1:35:43.840]  i'm not here to do this half speed i'm not here to play games
[1:35:43.840 --> 1:35:47.440]  doesn't mean i do a perfect job far from it but i'm going 110 percent
[1:35:47.440 --> 1:35:51.200]  i'm doing the best job i can and you know asking god every day to help me be
[1:35:51.200 --> 1:35:55.760]  strong and focused and to be given discernment and to have courage
[1:35:55.760 --> 1:36:00.080]  um and i just appreciate all of you that have donated at info wars moneybomb.com
[1:36:00.080 --> 1:36:03.280]  you can also call you want to call and talk to the crew and donate
[1:36:03.280 --> 1:36:13.440]  it's 888-253-3139 that's 888-253-3139
[1:36:13.440 --> 1:36:18.320]  or info wars moneybomb.com and uh i think we've got the technical capability
[1:36:18.320 --> 1:36:20.880]  told them about it yesterday but everybody's exhausted appeared to
[1:36:20.880 --> 1:36:25.200]  to restream the 27 hours in the video boxes that are already at info wars.com
[1:36:25.200 --> 1:36:28.880]  and prismpana.com we end the broadcast ends in an hour and
[1:36:28.880 --> 1:36:33.040]  25 minutes from now or so but it's cold 36 central right now
[1:36:33.040 --> 1:36:36.480]  uh and uh restream that over the audio streams we'll have to turn all the
[1:36:36.480 --> 1:36:40.960]  encoders off and do some stuff and actually on the restreams and stuff
[1:36:40.960 --> 1:36:45.120]  um i'm not even sure how to do that because some stations carry the fourth
[1:36:45.120 --> 1:36:48.720]  hour as we do that live a lot uh how do we turn everything off
[1:36:48.720 --> 1:36:52.240]  we're sending the video uh over the systems
[1:36:52.240 --> 1:36:56.080]  perhaps we'll re-air the first hour in the fourth hour and that gives them time
[1:36:56.080 --> 1:37:00.160]  to get the video stuff already and then relaunch that in all the video boxes
[1:37:00.160 --> 1:37:04.000]  and players that so many people are tuning into and watching
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:07.200]  right now i want to thank folks for going to info wars.com and
[1:37:07.200 --> 1:37:11.920]  getting that article up there uh that's a red linked
[1:37:11.920 --> 1:37:15.840]  titled info wars launches 24 hour plus offensive against tyranny
[1:37:15.840 --> 1:37:19.360]  you go to that it's got the rundown of who's been on who's coming up
[1:37:19.360 --> 1:37:23.360]  it's got our video streams it's got backup video streams
[1:37:23.360 --> 1:37:28.400]  it's all there right now at info wars.com and so it will continue
[1:37:28.400 --> 1:37:31.760]  and we're going to pre-empt the nightly news tonight just restream all of this
[1:37:31.760 --> 1:37:35.200]  because we're so many incredible guests a lot of it overnight people missed
[1:37:35.200 --> 1:37:39.760]  uh again i just want to thank my crew as well uh going back to jim a jim
[1:37:39.760 --> 1:37:43.680]  finishing up with jfk look you're the expert i mean you go into all the minutiae
[1:37:43.680 --> 1:37:46.640]  all the facts you're picking through it it would take years to cover it all
[1:37:46.640 --> 1:37:50.800]  literally it's ridiculous how much evidence there is uh that this fairytale
[1:37:50.800 --> 1:37:53.840]  is a fairytale the official story and over 90
[1:37:53.840 --> 1:37:57.520]  percent of the american people in average polls don't buy the fairytale
[1:37:57.520 --> 1:38:02.320]  so so we've pretty much won on the facts and and and in the court of public
[1:38:02.320 --> 1:38:06.400]  opinion but now you've had as you know uh the
[1:38:06.400 --> 1:38:09.920]  historian release the tapes with jackie kennedy
[1:38:09.920 --> 1:38:13.440]  saying that they that that lbj killed her husband and again
[1:38:13.440 --> 1:38:17.600]  people say that's covering up to sing jfk uh i mean lbj killed him
[1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:20.960]  that's as high as she knew obviously there's folks about that
[1:38:20.960 --> 1:38:24.320]  people are like that's a disinfo to say lbj killed kennedy
[1:38:24.320 --> 1:38:27.840]  you know it was the new world order yes i understand that i'm saying that's as
[1:38:27.840 --> 1:38:30.960]  high as uh e howard hunt who did the deathbed
[1:38:30.960 --> 1:38:35.440]  confession on video audio and text said and you've got bar mclellan the
[1:38:35.440 --> 1:38:39.440]  lawyer of lbj writing a book a few years ago and saying that and you've got
[1:38:39.440 --> 1:38:43.600]  you've got all these people i mean jackie kennedy the black ops cia hitman
[1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:49.360]  e howard hunt uh the uh the the lawyer for him i mean the list goes on and on
[1:38:49.360 --> 1:38:52.880]  and on so the whole fact that the system has invested
[1:38:52.880 --> 1:38:58.080]  so much time and energy in shelling this fable it really hurt some that people
[1:38:58.080 --> 1:39:01.120]  don't buy it uh and of course people question other
[1:39:01.120 --> 1:39:04.640]  things we have a government that's been caught injecting people with syphilis
[1:39:04.640 --> 1:39:08.480]  and radiating foster children and just a few years ago testing pesticides on
[1:39:08.480 --> 1:39:12.320]  children in new york state until they died that's new york daily news is my
[1:39:12.320 --> 1:39:16.000]  film in game the articles i mean you'd be crazy
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:19.280]  to not then always and the new world order says there's too many of us they
[1:39:19.280 --> 1:39:21.840]  want to get rid of us they want to put stuff in the water the white house
[1:39:21.840 --> 1:39:26.000]  science are and and he's a protege of you know others that were i mean i mean
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:28.800]  this is just crazy it's craziness and i know people
[1:39:28.800 --> 1:39:32.160]  have trouble coming face to face with something this bad
[1:39:32.160 --> 1:39:36.080]  to be able to deal with it but the facts are still the facts jim mars
[1:39:36.080 --> 1:39:40.320]  yeah that's exactly right and uh well what it boils down to
[1:39:40.320 --> 1:39:45.120]  is that they have control over the five multinational corporations that control
[1:39:45.120 --> 1:39:51.200]  the mass media the electronic media and therefore they control the masses this
[1:39:51.200 --> 1:39:55.600]  is why you don't hear politicians refer to the republic anymore
[1:39:55.600 --> 1:40:01.440]  we're not a republic uh they simply refer to democracy democracy gotta
[1:40:01.440 --> 1:40:06.000]  go and attack people around the world bomb their villages kill their children
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:11.280]  uh to bring them democracy well what is democracy democracy by definition
[1:40:11.280 --> 1:40:15.680]  is ruled by the majority okay which sounds great on paper but
[1:40:15.680 --> 1:40:20.400]  the classic example is a lynch mob and we don't want that we want a democratic
[1:40:20.400 --> 1:40:24.720]  republic where we elect officials and we have checks and balances and we
[1:40:24.720 --> 1:40:28.160]  operate under the rule of law but and that's why we have a
[1:40:28.160 --> 1:40:32.320]  constitution and a bill of rights but it's been pretty much thrown out the
[1:40:32.320 --> 1:40:36.640]  window uh i mean uh when obama decides we're
[1:40:36.640 --> 1:40:41.120]  going to launch missiles and bomb uh livia he didn't even bother to go to
[1:40:41.120 --> 1:40:46.000]  congress to get a resolution like george w bush did before he attacked
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:50.320]  iraq i mean we're just in jim i got a preemptive for 10 minutes i appreciate
[1:40:50.320 --> 1:40:55.040]  you were uh jesse ventura has called in he's i guess completed the press
[1:40:55.040 --> 1:40:59.040]  conference there in front of the federal uh courthouse and uh again
[1:40:59.040 --> 1:41:03.920]  if people miss the associated press and abc news and all the rest of it of the
[1:41:03.920 --> 1:41:06.880]  judge after waiting months and months and months to rule of the case to go
[1:41:06.880 --> 1:41:11.440]  forward said it was the wrong venue so for me that's not even so much thrown
[1:41:11.440 --> 1:41:17.520]  out as a punt uh as a as a chicken uh
[1:41:17.520 --> 1:41:21.440]  type uh behavior of just basically passing the buck
[1:41:21.440 --> 1:41:24.800]  and we're joined now by uh former minnesota governor jesse ventura best

[1:41:40.880 --> 1:41:44.080]  well sir a lot of people appreciate your courage and what you've done please
[1:41:44.080 --> 1:41:48.160]  tell us what you said at the uh press conference and what the rat establishment
[1:41:48.160 --> 1:41:52.720]  media was behaving like well they mainly just listened to what i had to say
[1:41:52.720 --> 1:41:57.120]  and i basically told them that i would i've now been stripped of my patriotism
[1:41:57.120 --> 1:42:00.320]  that i have no more feelings for this government
[1:42:00.320 --> 1:42:04.160]  that runs this country today because quite simply
[1:42:04.160 --> 1:42:07.360]  they deny me my right in court it seems that
[1:42:07.360 --> 1:42:12.000]  going after veterans seems to be the trend right now every time veterans try to
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:17.200]  exercise their uh their rights constitutional rights we
[1:42:17.200 --> 1:42:21.600]  seem to be getting cramped down i mean the one service man that was beaten up
[1:42:21.600 --> 1:42:26.400]  uh exercising his right to protest and now myself
[1:42:26.400 --> 1:42:30.080]  wanting to exercise my right to have a trial by jury
[1:42:30.080 --> 1:42:34.480]  and the government won't allow it to happen it's that simple
[1:42:34.480 --> 1:42:39.040]  now now governor i mean obviously that i was stunned and even though i was
[1:42:39.040 --> 1:42:42.880]  knew it was possible when you were kind enough to call me last night and keep
[1:42:42.880 --> 1:42:45.760]  me abreast of what happened and you said that they thrown it out and then i went
[1:42:45.760 --> 1:42:48.080]  and looked it up and it showed up in the media
[1:42:48.080 --> 1:42:52.000]  uh but but but the way this judge did it uh correct me if i'm wrong because you've
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:55.360]  got the actual ruling not just what the news is saying said well this was the
[1:42:55.360 --> 1:43:00.880]  wrong venue uh so well what what they claim
[1:43:00.880 --> 1:43:05.440]  alex is they have no jurisdiction well if the federal court doesn't have a
[1:43:05.440 --> 1:43:13.040]  jurisdiction over a constitutional question who the hell does
[1:43:13.040 --> 1:43:16.160]  okay because the way i read it was they were saying that they need to be to be
[1:43:16.160 --> 1:43:19.280]  another circuit court but but but you're saying your lawyer's saying in the
[1:43:19.280 --> 1:43:22.960]  ruling no they're just saying the the feds don't have jurisdiction over the
[1:43:22.960 --> 1:43:27.680]  tsa well what they're saying is that i have to go to the court of appeals in
[1:43:27.680 --> 1:43:31.120]  other words i'm guilty and i have to go to the court of
[1:43:31.120 --> 1:43:35.280]  appeals to be proved innocent i can't have a jury trial
[1:43:35.280 --> 1:43:39.840]  it has to be uh they're stating it has to go to the court of appeals
[1:43:39.840 --> 1:43:44.080]  which are three federally paid judges who will make the decision
[1:43:44.080 --> 1:43:47.600]  and and they say it's because of secrecy reasons
[1:43:47.600 --> 1:43:50.880]  so clearly they won't allow an open trial
[1:43:50.880 --> 1:43:56.160]  to happen concerning the fourth amendment of illegal search and seizure
[1:43:56.160 --> 1:44:01.440]  of our constitution governor jesse ventura two days ago when you were on
[1:44:01.440 --> 1:44:05.840]  with us uh you you made the central point that it's
[1:44:05.840 --> 1:44:08.880]  marshal law when you go to the airport and now they're on the highways
[1:44:08.880 --> 1:44:12.240]  and i look at this ruling they're saying national security
[1:44:12.240 --> 1:44:16.080]  it's secret we can't tell you you're a governor you're a navy veteran
[1:44:16.080 --> 1:44:19.280]  you know honorably discharged highly decorated all of this
[1:44:19.280 --> 1:44:23.280]  well known you have to be groped by somebody and when i was
[1:44:23.280 --> 1:44:26.880]  going through the tsa in los vegas when i was out there with you a few weeks ago
[1:44:26.880 --> 1:44:30.400]  when i was flying back to austin i said how do i know you're not a terrorist
[1:44:30.400 --> 1:44:34.320]  how do i know you're not guilty until proven innocent if i'm guilty and the
[1:44:34.320 --> 1:44:37.120]  guy said i can be trusted the government's check me out
[1:44:37.120 --> 1:44:40.480]  i mean it's this idea that we're all criminals we're all prisoners can you
[1:44:40.480 --> 1:44:44.480]  elaborate on your statement of of of what this country's now become
[1:44:44.480 --> 1:44:49.760]  and uh your statement about marshal law well clearly alex is that uh you know
[1:44:49.760 --> 1:44:54.080]  we're all guilty now until we prove we're innocent and the problem is
[1:44:54.080 --> 1:44:57.600]  we can't even prove we're innocent in front of a jury
[1:44:57.600 --> 1:45:01.600]  you know we i always thought we were guaranteed the right of a jury trial in
[1:45:01.600 --> 1:45:05.920]  this country that a trial of your peers of your citizens
[1:45:05.920 --> 1:45:09.680]  clearly the government doesn't want this going in front of citizens because
[1:45:09.680 --> 1:45:13.040]  obviously they'd lose and if they lost it would open
[1:45:13.040 --> 1:45:16.720]  up pandora's box and the other thing they don't want the other
[1:45:16.720 --> 1:45:20.560]  question they don't want out there is the question that
[1:45:20.560 --> 1:45:24.800]  why is it the government's job to provide security for the airlines when the
[1:45:24.800 --> 1:45:28.960]  airlines are a private sector business
[1:45:28.960 --> 1:45:32.080]  well what about you you were a governor you know more about the tenth amendment
[1:45:32.080 --> 1:45:36.000]  than i do since when to the feds i mean i can send you the the psa's they're
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:40.720]  now airing tv ads showing tsa at buccaneers games
[1:45:40.720 --> 1:45:44.640]  and it's shopping malls searching people and in governor they're now rolling out
[1:45:44.640 --> 1:45:48.160]  on the streets absolutely they are when you drive
[1:45:48.160 --> 1:45:53.040]  around the country now our border agents are no longer at the border they're
[1:45:53.040 --> 1:45:56.240]  out in the deserts they're out on interstate highways
[1:45:56.240 --> 1:46:01.200]  i predict alex that within the decade you will have to show i d to travel
[1:46:01.200 --> 1:46:06.000]  state to state in this country because the constitution is no more and the
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:09.360]  bill of rights are no more that was proven to me today
[1:46:09.360 --> 1:46:13.120]  when i wasn't allowed to go to court on them
[1:46:13.120 --> 1:46:17.280]  governor you know you've always told me that uh you know you stay focused you
[1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:21.040]  don't give up i mean i i think the answer is
[1:46:21.040 --> 1:46:24.240]  and obviously you'd run to win but run for president
[1:46:24.240 --> 1:46:28.080]  to try to you know say restore the bill of rights restore the constitution
[1:46:28.080 --> 1:46:32.960]  legalize freedom legalize america i mean you would get a lot of attention and
[1:46:32.960 --> 1:46:36.160]  could really put the heat on these people
[1:46:36.160 --> 1:46:39.600]  and i understand you know there's a lot of other countries but you love this
[1:46:39.600 --> 1:46:41.600]  nation it's not america that went wrong it's
[1:46:41.600 --> 1:46:45.440]  it's this corrupt system i mean are you i mean obviously you're percolating
[1:46:45.440 --> 1:46:49.600]  right now you're thinking but uh what's racing through your mind i mean what's
[1:46:49.600 --> 1:46:53.200]  next well i talked about it at the press conference today
[1:46:53.200 --> 1:46:57.680]  that i guess the only recourse i could have would be to win the presidency
[1:46:57.680 --> 1:47:02.000]  and then could i get my day in court as the president
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:05.840]  you know that would be my next question as president to the united states could
[1:47:05.840 --> 1:47:09.040]  i go to court over my fourth amendment rights
[1:47:09.040 --> 1:47:13.040]  i don't know alex i mean i can't run for president because i don't have ballot
[1:47:13.040 --> 1:47:17.600]  access in all 50 states and that would require a great deal of money
[1:47:17.600 --> 1:47:22.000]  a great deal of time and the system is set up so that you're not you can't
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:25.760]  achieve that that way the democrats and republicans
[1:47:25.760 --> 1:47:30.880]  the two-party dictatorship they hold the stranglehold on all our elections
[1:47:30.880 --> 1:47:35.760]  because an independent like me cannot get ballot access in all 50 states well
[1:47:35.760 --> 1:47:40.480]  governor you've always been a winner and you you know you won as a trail
[1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:44.080]  blazer in minnesota of uh you know out of nowhere as governor
[1:47:44.080 --> 1:47:47.520]  and the people are more angry and more awake than they have they've ever been
[1:47:47.520 --> 1:47:50.400]  you got one group of people that are more sheeple than ever but a lot of
[1:47:50.400 --> 1:47:53.920]  folks are really waking up ron paul is saying hey
[1:47:53.920 --> 1:47:58.000]  i might run his third party uh the libertarians are saying come on over
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:01.680]  if paul doesn't take it i they're the ones that have ballot access
[1:48:01.680 --> 1:48:04.480]  i think it's time for them to right now approach you
[1:48:04.480 --> 1:48:08.480]  and say you know because you've got the name you've got the knowledge
[1:48:08.480 --> 1:48:13.520]  you've got the track record uh and and and again i understand the instinct
[1:48:13.520 --> 1:48:16.080]  because i i haven't myself to just get out of here
[1:48:16.080 --> 1:48:20.880]  and i won't blame you if you do that uh because you know there's you're a navy
[1:48:20.880 --> 1:48:22.960]  guy there's such a thing as abandoning ship but
[1:48:22.960 --> 1:48:26.880]  you've been a captain you've been a governor and i think we need you to
[1:48:26.880 --> 1:48:30.000]  you know try to save the republic and you've already done so much i hate to
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:34.720]  say do more more more but well let me put it to you this way alex the balls
[1:48:34.720 --> 1:48:39.040]  in the libertarian court now they have to approach me or they have to approach
[1:48:39.040 --> 1:48:42.480]  congressman paul whoever they want to approach to be their
[1:48:42.480 --> 1:48:46.160]  presidential candidate i i'm not going to approach them they
[1:48:46.160 --> 1:48:49.760]  will have to approach me what is your mental
[1:48:49.760 --> 1:48:52.960]  i mean when you got the call from your lawyer and heard about the ruling
[1:48:52.960 --> 1:48:57.680]  what was the first thing went through your mind and and please give us uh any
[1:48:57.680 --> 1:49:00.080]  other points that you made at the press conference sir
[1:49:00.080 --> 1:49:04.560]  well what went through my mind it was it was very disheartening it was like
[1:49:04.560 --> 1:49:09.440]  having your guts pulled out of you uh they gutted me as far as my patriotism
[1:49:09.440 --> 1:49:13.760]  goes i have no patriotism whatsoever to this government today
[1:49:13.760 --> 1:49:18.320]  but i you know as my t-shirts say i love my country not my government
[1:49:18.320 --> 1:49:22.000]  and i think that speaks volumes the way i feel right now alex
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:27.440]  i have no love for the government of the united states of america today
[1:49:27.440 --> 1:49:33.920]  how's your house terry taking your wife like always she's a battler she'll do
[1:49:33.920 --> 1:49:38.160]  she stands by me no matter what i do i couldn't ask for a better person that
[1:49:38.160 --> 1:49:43.440]  way and not show gritter teeth and get through it i hope
[1:49:43.440 --> 1:49:47.280]  well we were hoping for for sanity and government but it just you know we tried
[1:49:47.280 --> 1:49:50.480]  in texas it's not going to happen alex when a
[1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:55.280]  citizen can't go to court to to fight for the bill of
[1:49:55.280 --> 1:49:58.640]  rights his rights his basic bill of rights in this
[1:49:58.640 --> 1:50:02.000]  country when they won't allow you to go to court
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:07.120]  over that well that tells you i will now refer to this country no longer as the
[1:50:07.120 --> 1:50:11.360]  united states of america i will refer to it as the fascist
[1:50:11.360 --> 1:50:15.280]  states of america because that's what i believe we are alex
[1:50:15.280 --> 1:50:20.400]  we are fascist now well there's no doubt in fact there's a quote in the
[1:50:20.400 --> 1:50:24.080]  associated press where you said uh this is not the country i grew up in
[1:50:24.080 --> 1:50:29.760]  america is now a fascist nation yeah and i i quoted kevin costner today at the
[1:50:29.760 --> 1:50:33.040]  press conference i said this is not the country i was born in
[1:50:33.040 --> 1:50:38.000]  and it's certainly not going to be the country i die in well look the country's
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:43.760]  been hijacked and and and yes the we got to take it back
[1:50:43.760 --> 1:50:48.400]  well i know you're a busy man uh just uh you know as soon as you leave i'll have
[1:50:48.400 --> 1:50:51.200]  50 questions that pop my head this is all
[1:50:51.200 --> 1:50:56.080]  stunning unfortunately alex i got to take off so we gotta end it now but i'll
[1:50:56.080 --> 1:50:58.800]  try to get back to you if you'll have me on next week
[1:50:58.800 --> 1:51:03.440]  we'll talk about it more in depth next week absolutely uh and uh perhaps we
[1:51:03.440 --> 1:51:05.760]  need to talk later when you get home or next week
[1:51:05.760 --> 1:51:10.640]  off air about strategy i know ty called me last night he was getting on a plane
[1:51:10.640 --> 1:51:13.920]  i didn't come be with you there and we were talking strategy and i was going
[1:51:13.920 --> 1:51:16.800]  to send him some information i think one way to go after him and then i'll let
[1:51:16.800 --> 1:51:21.440]  you go because i know you're busy is the fact that statistically there are such
[1:51:21.440 --> 1:51:25.200]  criminals only criminals or crazy people would want to be groping people all
[1:51:25.200 --> 1:51:28.960]  day and they're constantly caught stealing money pedophiles
[1:51:28.960 --> 1:51:32.640]  uh i think the health issue of the scanners is a way to go after them
[1:51:32.640 --> 1:51:38.080]  uh but uh is there anywhere we can read the ruling
[1:51:38.080 --> 1:51:42.560]  no because the rulings are secret my court case said that
[1:51:42.560 --> 1:51:47.680]  you cannot know what's legal for the tsa to do or not it's considered
[1:51:47.680 --> 1:51:51.440]  uh it's considered national security so there's no way to know
[1:51:51.440 --> 1:51:55.200]  if you're being abused or not all right i'll let you go in 60 because i know you
[1:51:55.200 --> 1:51:58.160]  got to go but this is big news because this is not in the news
[1:51:58.160 --> 1:52:01.440]  i've read literally 15 upscan 50 something articles
[1:52:01.440 --> 1:52:04.400]  up there of 100 and something that are on google with just even tourist name in
[1:52:04.400 --> 1:52:08.000]  it today and it doesn't ever say that that your
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:11.680]  lawyer told you that he can't even see the ruling i mean give us the
[1:52:11.680 --> 1:52:15.600]  specific because that's big news this is like 1984 kothka
[1:52:15.600 --> 1:52:18.560]  where you can't find art of the soviet union you can't find out what you've
[1:52:18.560 --> 1:52:22.880]  been charged with exactly you have no way
[1:52:22.880 --> 1:52:28.240]  and even the judge said it in a ruling that it's secret and we have no way of
[1:52:28.240 --> 1:52:32.480]  knowing whether the governor was abused or not because again
[1:52:32.480 --> 1:52:36.320]  you don't know the rules and they can change them anytime they want
[1:52:36.320 --> 1:52:39.440]  and there's no way to hold them accountable the government in any way
[1:52:39.440 --> 1:52:42.960]  shape or form well governor that is martial law when when
[1:52:42.960 --> 1:52:46.240]  when the courts say it's secret when you try to bring up your rights and
[1:52:46.240 --> 1:52:49.280]  you've got to go to a star chamber at the appeals court
[1:52:49.280 --> 1:52:52.400]  uh and and so you're not even going to seek going to the appeals because
[1:52:52.400 --> 1:52:55.600]  that's not a jury that's a fraud that's giving into the sham
[1:52:55.600 --> 1:52:59.360]  well i don't know yet i haven't discussed my alternatives with my lawyer
[1:52:59.360 --> 1:53:02.960]  yet we'll probably do that early next week of whether i want to try to take
[1:53:02.960 --> 1:53:07.920]  it to the court of appeals but again alex that's three paid judges
[1:53:07.920 --> 1:53:13.920]  by the u.s government you think for one second they're going to rule in my favor
[1:53:13.920 --> 1:53:17.680]  no well in closing i appreciate you calling us first after the press conference
[1:53:17.680 --> 1:53:19.440]  i'm very honored and i want to tell you that
[1:53:19.440 --> 1:53:23.200]  jim mars who of course wrote the book that was used in the film jfk
[1:53:23.200 --> 1:53:26.400]  uh is he's on hold he just said he wants to really thank you
[1:53:26.400 --> 1:53:29.280]  i have when he heard you were probably going to be coming on um
[1:53:29.280 --> 1:53:33.120]  dade mustain said he wants to thank you just spontaneously everybody i talked
[1:53:33.120 --> 1:53:35.920]  to because people are really upset about this watching their wives or
[1:53:35.920 --> 1:53:39.920]  children grow up they all say thank you jesse for what you did and thank you to
[1:53:39.920 --> 1:53:43.040]  your family for going through all you've done and the media

[1:54:26.080 --> 1:54:29.680]  stuff and then they were laughing and it's just even turn the idiots asked him
[1:54:29.680 --> 1:54:34.960]  for autographs after they grubbed him and he was like no and uh and then i was
[1:54:34.960 --> 1:54:38.720]  like hey i shot video and photos of it you know and he's like let me see it he
[1:54:38.720 --> 1:54:41.920]  goes well it's embarrassing erase it and later would have been good actually for

[1:54:45.600 --> 1:54:48.800]  he was in a good mood until he did that and then our plane was away for like
[1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:53.360]  three hours and he was just sitting around and he would go over to troops
[1:54:53.360 --> 1:54:56.160]  that were all flying out of Atlanta and say do you like this do you know what's
[1:54:56.160 --> 1:54:59.440]  going on and and i mean by the time he got on the plane
[1:54:59.440 --> 1:55:03.680]  i mean he was just like you know controlled rage and i mean it's like a
[1:55:03.680 --> 1:55:07.440]  joke the media is all ventura claims he's been abused
[1:55:07.440 --> 1:55:11.680]  ventura claims he's i mean flying hundreds of times a year
[1:55:11.680 --> 1:55:15.440]  with him going up in his legs you know again i told the guy you know i'm
[1:55:15.440 --> 1:55:18.320]  gonna probably sue you if you grope me so he didn't do all that stuff
[1:55:18.320 --> 1:55:21.520]  he did he goes well i have to check the waistband he just barely it was still
[1:55:21.520 --> 1:55:25.840]  a violation people say well well man up the pilots most of them
[1:55:25.840 --> 1:55:29.920]  combat pilot veterans that came out last year we're going back to jim
[1:55:29.920 --> 1:55:35.440]  they would physically go it was reported and vomit
[1:55:35.440 --> 1:55:40.080]  or they they were unable to fly uh they would say and then their union said
[1:55:40.080 --> 1:55:43.200]  that's it we're shutting air traffic down and they said okay now you go through
[1:55:43.200 --> 1:55:46.480]  your own line and we'll stop groping and they quit for a few months
[1:55:46.480 --> 1:55:50.480]  in that new special line but then now started it again with some of the pilots
[1:55:50.480 --> 1:55:54.400]  and people said well why would some guys been a vietnam combat pilot one of them
[1:55:54.400 --> 1:55:58.240]  you know all you know perfect flying record whatever why would you have to
[1:55:58.240 --> 1:56:01.920]  leave and then get home and vomit in your parking lot because you live your whole
[1:56:01.920 --> 1:56:05.360]  life as a man as an upstanding good person who's all about your personal
[1:56:05.360 --> 1:56:08.640]  space your family and walking up people in uniforms
[1:56:08.640 --> 1:56:13.280]  this is like being sent to prison this is like being sent to prison i'll tell
[1:56:13.280 --> 1:56:16.560]  you i got in a fistfight one time where the guy was a lot bigger than me and
[1:56:16.560 --> 1:56:19.840]  boy that's when there's trouble because that's when you know i go into that
[1:56:19.840 --> 1:56:23.760]  caveman mode and some big 250 pound guy i'm 170 pounds then
[1:56:23.760 --> 1:56:26.720]  it's really hurting me you know it's kind of blackout time people get hurt
[1:56:26.720 --> 1:56:31.600]  so a couple times i was sent to jail as a juvenile but one time it was uh really
[1:56:31.600 --> 1:56:36.000]  bad at tarot and uh and i had the pervert guard come
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:39.680]  get me and say he was gonna go take a shower with me and i told him
[1:56:39.680 --> 1:56:43.120]  you know i said you're gonna pay for this and he and i said you will pay
[1:56:43.120 --> 1:56:47.040]  and i said am i dad because i know my dad he's a really sweet guy but i you know
[1:56:47.040 --> 1:56:50.560]  i knew him i mean i said you're gonna pay there's still such a thing as texas
[1:56:50.560 --> 1:56:53.920]  justice i said so and i wasn't gonna you know i
[1:56:53.920 --> 1:56:57.680]  said you're gonna pay for this and he said you just get back in there then i
[1:56:57.680 --> 1:56:59.760]  was in solitary for like three days till they
[1:56:59.760 --> 1:57:02.560]  got in the court and got me out because i didn't start the fight
[1:57:02.560 --> 1:57:05.760]  that you know you know the big tough guy wrestling champion started it and he
[1:57:05.760 --> 1:57:09.360]  got his brains basically bashed out uh because you start hurting me man
[1:57:09.360 --> 1:57:12.560]  that's you know that's where the switch gets thrown
[1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:16.160]  and and and you know in this country you should be able to to
[1:57:16.160 --> 1:57:20.240]  to defend yourself and my point is the feeling of that guy pushing me into
[1:57:20.240 --> 1:57:22.960]  that shower and i was dressing was take your clothes off for touching me
[1:57:22.960 --> 1:57:27.120]  the feeling of that was wanted to throw up i mean that must be what's like for a
[1:57:27.120 --> 1:57:31.360]  woman when somebody rapes them you know they say well just enjoy it bull crap
[1:57:31.360 --> 1:57:38.160]  bull crap okay i mean listen i you know growing up dating girls the first

[1:58:49.520 --> 1:58:53.200]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you
[1:58:53.200 --> 1:58:57.040]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[1:58:57.040 --> 1:58:59.920]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[1:58:59.920 --> 1:59:04.160]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[1:59:04.160 --> 1:59:07.760]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[1:59:07.760 --> 1:59:11.280]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[1:59:11.280 --> 1:59:14.960]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:59:14.960 --> 1:59:17.920]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[1:59:17.920 --> 1:59:21.760]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[1:59:21.760 --> 1:59:25.120]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[1:59:25.120 --> 1:59:28.880]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[1:59:28.880 --> 1:59:31.760]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[1:59:31.760 --> 1:59:34.800]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[1:59:34.800 --> 1:59:37.520]  science one of my old sponsors you can get more

[2:00:05.920 --> 2:00:10.720]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups

[2:00:41.760 --> 2:00:46.640]  watson earlier in the morning um i'm not sure about the whole
[2:00:46.640 --> 2:00:50.000]  scheduling but we're going to attempt to restrain the 27 hours again when the
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:53.680]  show's over today or somewhere thereafter so we'll leave the
[2:00:53.680 --> 2:00:58.080]  video boxes up if not it's all going to be archived at prismplanet.tv
[2:00:58.080 --> 2:01:02.000]  finishing up with jim mars uh jim i i guess we let you go when ventura was on
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:04.880]  so it wouldn't cross lines but he said uh you know i told him that you were
[2:01:04.880 --> 2:01:08.720]  saying that that you appreciate him um with his lawsuit in his attempt and he
[2:01:08.720 --> 2:01:12.320]  said to stay on the trail of the assassins and thank you jim
[2:01:12.320 --> 2:01:16.400]  great uh since you missed that but uh hey why don't we all jump in
[2:01:16.400 --> 2:01:22.080]  and refile as soon as a class action suit
[2:01:22.080 --> 2:01:25.440]  i'm ready to sign on to it i'm really thinking about suing them anyways i am
[2:01:25.440 --> 2:01:28.480]  too but because have you ever considered this alex
[2:01:28.480 --> 2:01:35.760]  at the height of hitlers nazi third rike the gestapo who admittedly if they
[2:01:35.760 --> 2:01:39.440]  got you alone the basement would do almost anything but
[2:01:39.440 --> 2:01:43.920]  still in all even the nazis at the height of their power
[2:01:43.920 --> 2:01:49.040]  did not have the audacity to try to grow people in a public place
[2:01:49.040 --> 2:01:53.520]  because those europeans in the 30s and 40s would not have put up with that
[2:01:53.520 --> 2:01:58.320]  why are we putting up with this i don't understand
[2:01:59.520 --> 2:02:03.760]  i don't know either it just it just absolutely makes my head spin
[2:02:03.760 --> 2:02:06.240]  well listen i know you're getting tired and
[2:02:06.240 --> 2:02:10.400]  ragged out here after the long thing and i just everybody's listening
[2:02:10.400 --> 2:02:15.280]  all right so listen you need to support alex and you need to contribute
[2:02:15.280 --> 2:02:20.800]  whatever you can because uh alex along with a lot of other people
[2:02:20.800 --> 2:02:24.400]  is reaching a lot of people he probably reaches more people than
[2:02:24.400 --> 2:02:28.320]  than the people that read my books because people don't seem to be reading
[2:02:28.320 --> 2:02:33.360]  much anymore and you need to support alex you really do
[2:02:33.360 --> 2:02:39.680]  and i appreciate everyone who is uh put their uh
[2:02:39.680 --> 2:02:43.360]  their uh money their mouth is their money yeah up to
[2:02:43.360 --> 2:02:49.360]  to do that and i congratulate you um
[2:02:49.360 --> 2:02:52.640]  well jim i want to congratulate people that have donated to the m4's money
[2:02:52.640 --> 2:02:55.760]  bomb and they continue throughout the weekend uh
[2:02:55.760 --> 2:02:59.360]  because uh it's it's it's having a huge effect and look what we've built i got
[2:02:59.360 --> 2:03:03.040]  to have you back down now we've we've we've doubled the size of the studio
[2:03:03.040 --> 2:03:06.080]  we've built the whole the tv is now reaching
[2:03:06.080 --> 2:03:09.920]  overall about another million people a week you've doubled that big
[2:03:09.920 --> 2:03:15.760]  warehouse area you you had yep you you must be covering about most of south
[2:03:15.760 --> 2:03:19.760]  austin but now now look as we found it the cheapest
[2:03:19.760 --> 2:03:23.760]  it is out here by the airport and it is an industrial area and we had to put a
[2:03:23.760 --> 2:03:27.680]  lot of stuff in that was why we got it so cheap this is the cheapest
[2:03:27.680 --> 2:03:32.000]  cheapest square foot in the city welden henson's the one that actually found
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:35.360]  this place four years ago and then it took us about six eight months to move
[2:03:35.360 --> 2:03:39.120]  in everything and then the rest is history but and then let me tell you
[2:03:39.120 --> 2:03:43.280]  off let me tell you folks any place in austin is not cheap
[2:03:43.280 --> 2:03:47.040]  austin is not a cheap place to live so you know
[2:03:47.040 --> 2:03:50.880]  alex needs all the help he can get yeah but uh
[2:03:50.880 --> 2:03:54.080]  well when it comes to the rent it's a it's a nut to crack another compared to
[2:03:54.080 --> 2:03:57.120]  the bandwidth and stuff the point is the economy so bad they couldn't
[2:03:57.120 --> 2:04:01.120]  lease the thing next door so i got that i thought this was a good deal i got
[2:04:01.120 --> 2:04:06.080]  that for like half of what i got this and uh so it is big we haven't even
[2:04:06.080 --> 2:04:08.800]  filled it all up it's got room to grow that's my plan
[2:04:08.800 --> 2:04:11.760]  because i don't want to leave here and we put a lot of time and energy into it
[2:04:11.760 --> 2:04:14.160]  we could have done all this folks look look what we built go watch the videos
[2:04:14.160 --> 2:04:17.600]  you see the shows the our output against the globalist is a lot bigger
[2:04:17.600 --> 2:04:21.840]  you can call toll free and donate 8882533139

[2:08:22.240 --> 2:08:26.320]  hour after his press conference went right over to his car and called in on
[2:08:26.320 --> 2:08:28.960]  the show he said this is no longer the united
[2:08:28.960 --> 2:08:35.120]  states of america it's the united states of fascism
[2:08:35.120 --> 2:08:39.200]  not the united states of america or the fascist united states that's what he

[2:10:34.320 --> 2:10:40.080]  bit of uh the transmission southern we've been going 26 hours and 10 minutes
[2:10:40.080 --> 2:10:44.480]  pretty much here uh and uh watson who popped in and
[2:10:44.480 --> 2:10:47.920]  covered for us a little bit this morning uh he is going to
[2:10:47.920 --> 2:10:52.320]  close it out and job well done to everybody but again on this sunday we'll
[2:10:52.320 --> 2:10:54.960]  be back four to six p.m and obviously next monday in your

[2:10:59.200 --> 2:11:04.800]  and um this is just despicable that that the
[2:11:04.800 --> 2:11:08.080]  ruling is secret he can't even see it in his lawyer can but it's national
[2:11:08.080 --> 2:11:13.040]  security and he doesn't get to have a jury trial i mean you can't in america
[2:11:13.040 --> 2:11:16.960]  basically sue the tsa they're announcing immunity the government is
[2:11:16.960 --> 2:11:20.160]  totally criminal and they're telling you driving's a privilege you're telling
[2:11:20.160 --> 2:11:24.640]  you owning guns or privileges i've got the cases where they say driving is not
[2:11:24.640 --> 2:11:28.800]  a privilege commercial driving is it's all a load of bull
[2:11:28.800 --> 2:11:32.480]  it's just this government is now no one 50 years ago would imagine they'd have
[2:11:32.480 --> 2:11:35.520]  cameras and microphones and street lights and now they just do it they go
[2:11:35.520 --> 2:11:39.280]  that's freedom well the police will tape you in public we will arrest you if you
[2:11:39.280 --> 2:11:41.920]  tape us but the law doesn't say that we're
[2:11:41.920 --> 2:11:45.440]  still gonna have a jury send you to prison i mean the government's got
[2:11:45.440 --> 2:11:48.960]  cancer the government is crook run does that mean every level is criminal no
[2:11:48.960 --> 2:11:53.280]  but at the top there are a bunch of crooks amazing information uh i want to
[2:11:53.280 --> 2:11:56.160]  just say hi to bob because uh it's always one of my high points in the week to
[2:11:56.160 --> 2:12:00.480]  get to talk to bob Chapman of the international forecaster.com
[2:12:00.480 --> 2:12:03.840]  and uh lots going on in the economy golden silver i should try to rope chat in
[2:12:03.840 --> 2:12:05.600]  here towards the end of the hour and now we got
[2:12:05.600 --> 2:12:09.040]  phones too i never got to them i'm the only person in radio i know
[2:12:09.040 --> 2:12:12.480]  who didn't lean on the callers in fact even though i'm exhausted i want to be
[2:12:12.480 --> 2:12:16.000]  here and talk about stuff because i don't like being a slave i want to fight
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:20.160]  and um it's just up up to all of us to do our
[2:12:20.160 --> 2:12:23.840]  bit and these poor brainwash tsa people who there's no radiation coming out of
[2:12:23.840 --> 2:12:26.480]  those they've shown me the documents they said in los vegas
[2:12:26.480 --> 2:12:29.600]  when i was out there uh doing a shoot with ventura
[2:12:29.600 --> 2:12:32.880]  uh out at some rocket bases and stuff when i was flying back out
[2:12:32.880 --> 2:12:37.680]  and uh and and i have government uh what they say administrative privileges
[2:12:37.680 --> 2:12:41.600]  over you i mean it's just
[2:12:41.600 --> 2:12:46.080]  they really believe all this bull uh that they uh tell these people
[2:12:46.080 --> 2:12:49.520]  uh would you like to go in a private area to be funneled uh you know that's
[2:12:49.520 --> 2:12:52.640]  where all of this is going and uh we better do something about it
[2:12:52.640 --> 2:12:56.880]  bob Chapman what do you think of uh jesse uh and his lawyer being told it's a
[2:12:56.880 --> 2:13:00.320]  star chamber you can only go to the appeals court before judges that will
[2:13:00.320 --> 2:13:02.960]  be secret you can't see the ruling but it's national
[2:13:02.960 --> 2:13:06.640]  security and you don't have a right to come here and
[2:13:06.640 --> 2:13:10.400]  challenge your fourth amendment being violated to travel having your genitals
[2:13:10.400 --> 2:13:15.200]  grabbed over and over again and being put in microwave oven machines
[2:13:15.200 --> 2:13:20.080]  well it's typical uh it was something that one would have expected
[2:13:20.080 --> 2:13:25.840]  uh considering the direction that government is headed in america
[2:13:25.840 --> 2:13:29.760]  and it's the reminiscent of the 1930s in germany
[2:13:29.760 --> 2:13:34.000]  uh i don't have to go into any detail on that because i think most people know
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:40.320]  about it and um we've just to get to expose exactly
[2:13:40.320 --> 2:13:45.760]  what they're doing make it front page news and make sure everybody in the
[2:13:45.760 --> 2:13:49.200]  country and outside the country sees it as well
[2:13:49.200 --> 2:13:53.600]  because uh they are telling you you're going to do what we
[2:13:53.600 --> 2:13:58.000]  tell you to do and i think it's going to cause a lot of people
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:02.080]  probably leave the country who have the ability to do so
[2:14:02.080 --> 2:14:08.160]  and i know uh jesse is spending uh half of his year down in bahá
[2:14:08.160 --> 2:14:13.360]  and don't blame him it's a very nice place and uh he doesn't have to put up
[2:14:13.360 --> 2:14:18.320]  with that but when he comes back he does yeah in a third world collapse society
[2:14:18.320 --> 2:14:21.760]  he doesn't have to put up with that oh north korea they don't grab your
[2:14:21.760 --> 2:14:24.320]  genitals unless you're you know pulled out and they think you're
[2:14:24.320 --> 2:14:27.600]  and they take you for a strip search they're not doing that i mean land of
[2:14:27.600 --> 2:14:31.360]  the slave home of the coward
[2:14:31.920 --> 2:14:35.680]  you're right and uh this is all leading us to the
[2:14:35.680 --> 2:14:41.120]  next election and uh if we have it it'll probably be the last one
[2:14:41.120 --> 2:14:45.440]  and uh hopefully we can get Ron Paul and people like him elected
[2:14:45.440 --> 2:14:50.000]  through the system and then we get a shot at turning this thing around
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:54.800]  and if we all work toward that then maybe we we can get it accomplished
[2:14:54.800 --> 2:14:59.120]  because it's so important because this is it
[2:14:59.120 --> 2:15:02.640]  well i'm gonna i'm gonna hand the baton over to paul watson for the last 45
[2:15:02.640 --> 2:15:05.680]  minutes we got collars on hold hopefully you guys will get to those

[2:16:55.760 --> 2:17:02.640]  thanks alex yeah just a comment on the tsa and ventura um i would add that we
[2:17:02.640 --> 2:17:06.960]  have had some achievements specifically as a result of
[2:17:06.960 --> 2:17:10.960]  people like ventura and others standing up against the tsa
[2:17:10.960 --> 2:17:15.520]  um they've now had to dispense with the naked images for the body scanners
[2:17:15.520 --> 2:17:18.560]  they're having to put in software which shows a generic
[2:17:18.560 --> 2:17:22.320]  outline image um that's an achievement again
[2:17:22.320 --> 2:17:25.600]  this doesn't stop the groping or anything but it's you know we're
[2:17:25.600 --> 2:17:29.840]  we're chipping away at it if you like in britain they've
[2:17:29.840 --> 2:17:33.840]  in britain's biggest airport Heathrow they've had to change the technology
[2:17:33.840 --> 2:17:37.120]  they're used for the scanners no longer they're using the
[2:17:37.120 --> 2:17:42.480]  radiation firing technology they had to change it to what some corporations
[2:17:42.480 --> 2:17:45.920]  like sony are already using for their employees which
[2:17:45.920 --> 2:17:49.680]  involves a different system which isn't harmful to hell so
[2:17:49.680 --> 2:17:53.760]  you know chipping away at it one piece by one but again
[2:17:53.760 --> 2:17:56.720]  the the main issue has to be the gropedowns i mean
[2:17:56.720 --> 2:18:01.440]  when i travel i travel quite regularly in europe and also
[2:18:01.440 --> 2:18:05.920]  to asia to china and i mean the difference between
[2:18:05.920 --> 2:18:10.320]  communist china which is renowned for torturing and imprisoning its political
[2:18:10.320 --> 2:18:13.760]  dissidents and the experience you have with homeland
[2:18:13.760 --> 2:18:17.360]  security entering you know land of the free
[2:18:17.360 --> 2:18:20.800]  in china you just go straight through the metal detector
[2:18:20.800 --> 2:18:24.240]  don't set it off you go straight through there's no pat down whatsoever stamp
[2:18:24.240 --> 2:18:29.200]  your visa you're in the country bang homeland security you have to literally
[2:18:29.200 --> 2:18:34.320]  and this was seven years ago iris scan five fingerprints
[2:18:34.320 --> 2:18:39.680]  you know gropedown and everything so the the difference is stark and it shows
[2:18:39.680 --> 2:18:43.600]  how deep america has fallen into this tyranny but as i said which is by the
[2:18:43.600 --> 2:18:46.960]  way just interrupting i'm back now don't want to leave
[2:18:46.960 --> 2:18:51.200]  we've now confirmed that in miami we got a email about it in a photo but not
[2:18:51.200 --> 2:18:55.680]  we've checked it out to get video games they're now having people or to sell
[2:18:55.680 --> 2:18:57.840]  them back which they have a lot of places
[2:18:57.840 --> 2:19:02.080]  they biometrically scan you with the police department so normal commerce
[2:19:02.080 --> 2:19:05.040]  is now criminal sorry go ahead i'm out of here folks great job everybody
[2:19:05.040 --> 2:19:10.240]  go ahead paul yeah so again normal commerce is
[2:19:10.240 --> 2:19:12.880]  criminal again they're trying to outlaw cash in
[2:19:12.880 --> 2:19:17.280]  louisiana and other places in britain they're trying to outlaw cash by blaming
[2:19:17.280 --> 2:19:21.200]  the fact that people are stealing copper and metal because of the crumbling
[2:19:21.200 --> 2:19:23.920]  economy it's worth more and more people are trying to sell it
[2:19:23.920 --> 2:19:27.680]  on the black market and of course the government is blaming the fact that they
[2:19:27.680 --> 2:19:30.960]  have transactions in cash so it's a widespread
[2:19:30.960 --> 2:19:34.640]  assault against our freedoms our personal liberties and
[2:19:34.640 --> 2:19:40.000]  individual convenience down to the level of using cash but as i said you know
[2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:43.600]  if we weren't here it'd be a hell of a lot worse so i'm chipping away at it

[2:24:13.520 --> 2:24:19.520]  we're back on the alex joneshow live in bobo's moneybomb.com and we're joined
[2:24:19.520 --> 2:24:23.920]  by bob Chapman of the international forecaster.com
[2:24:23.920 --> 2:24:28.160]  of course earlier in the week we saw the greek prime minister
[2:24:28.160 --> 2:24:33.280]  papandreou threatened to call this referendum on the EU bailout package
[2:24:33.280 --> 2:24:38.480]  which in itself was largely political bluffing even if the greek people had
[2:24:38.480 --> 2:24:41.920]  been allowed to vote history tells us in the case of island
[2:24:41.920 --> 2:24:46.320]  demarc and france when europeans vote against the EU
[2:24:46.320 --> 2:24:49.920]  the EU simply ignores the referendum or keeps having more
[2:24:49.920 --> 2:24:54.480]  referendums until they get the vote they won as any good
[2:24:54.480 --> 2:24:58.400]  dictatorship would but again papandreou
[2:24:58.400 --> 2:25:03.120]  he brings up this idea of a referendum literally the day after sarcosi and
[2:25:03.120 --> 2:25:08.000]  merkel have a quiet word in his ear and it's promptly dropped
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:11.600]  and so we have this euro bailout crisis
[2:25:11.600 --> 2:25:16.720]  bandwagon black comedy rolling on and on the euro swings from one extreme to the
[2:25:16.720 --> 2:25:21.440]  other against the dollar on each little rumor that comes out on a day by day
[2:25:21.440 --> 2:25:25.120]  basis bob Chapman i mean give us the
[2:25:25.120 --> 2:25:30.000]  latest on this euro crisis i want to know how can a problem
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  with greece and these other pigs countries that was caused by taking on
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:40.720]  too much debt possibly be sold by taking on yet more debt
[2:25:41.440 --> 2:25:46.480]  well obviously it cannot uh that's easy to figure out
[2:25:46.480 --> 2:25:51.520]  it's the saving of the euro and the eurozone and the european union
[2:25:51.520 --> 2:25:58.160]  and uh i think that papandreou probably first
[2:25:58.160 --> 2:26:03.440]  introduced this referendum thinking that it might get him
[2:26:03.440 --> 2:26:10.480]  uh out of the situation that he was in uh as easily as possible
[2:26:10.480 --> 2:26:14.000]  and of course what he went to con uh yesterday he was told
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:17.600]  unceremoniously i'm sure what are you doing
[2:26:17.600 --> 2:26:22.480]  now why would you do a thing like that you know uh the polls show 60 to 70
[2:26:22.480 --> 2:26:28.800]  percent of the people are going to vote no and even if you twist the question
[2:26:28.800 --> 2:26:33.360]  that's to be answered yes or no um you're not going to hold that many people
[2:26:33.360 --> 2:26:36.640]  because they expect you to post something like that
[2:26:36.640 --> 2:26:42.640]  and so now they're having a um meeting to see if they want to keep
[2:26:42.640 --> 2:26:47.680]  mr papandreou in office a confidence or non-confidence vote
[2:26:47.680 --> 2:26:52.080]  which is very very close and i'm sure that uh
[2:26:52.080 --> 2:26:57.680]  somebody there from uh pacic is running around with a
[2:26:57.680 --> 2:27:05.840]  bushel basket of 500 euro notes saying uh we want you to vote for us
[2:27:05.840 --> 2:27:12.000]  and that's probably what's going on uh summer us it is the shade better
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:15.600]  but no great shake those two are uh roommates at harvard
[2:27:15.600 --> 2:27:19.520]  for those of you who don't know that and they used to be in the same party
[2:27:19.520 --> 2:27:22.960]  together till i had a minor falling out and uh
[2:27:22.960 --> 2:27:26.640]  summer has formed his own party and i don't think he's going to do that much
[2:27:26.640 --> 2:27:30.800]  to help but they simply they the people in
[2:27:30.800 --> 2:27:34.800]  greater europe in the powerful positions
[2:27:34.800 --> 2:27:41.440]  want to yes on the second bailout that's what they're interested in
[2:27:41.440 --> 2:27:45.520]  they don't want anybody leaving the euro that's really what it's about
[2:27:45.520 --> 2:27:49.840]  but the problems don't end there uh you've got the german constitutional
[2:27:49.840 --> 2:27:52.400]  court before the end of the year is going to say
[2:27:52.400 --> 2:27:59.760]  whether the second uh bailout and uh the committee of
[2:27:59.760 --> 2:28:06.640]  12 that they formed to bypass uh legislation in germany
[2:28:06.640 --> 2:28:13.840]  and uh the ability to leverage is legal under the german constitution
[2:28:13.840 --> 2:28:18.400]  and the politicians have already been told in germany it's not legal
[2:28:18.400 --> 2:28:22.880]  and so where is that going to go it's going to be interesting to see
[2:28:22.880 --> 2:28:28.800]  uh you can now go allocate the money but until the german constitutional court
[2:28:28.800 --> 2:28:33.200]  makes their decision they can't leverage it and they do that
[2:28:33.200 --> 2:28:36.720]  by using derivatives instead of having just about
[2:28:36.720 --> 2:28:40.160]  500 billion dollars in which germany put out half of it
[2:28:40.160 --> 2:28:48.160]  uh that money would grow to 1.4 trillion if leverage is allowed
[2:28:48.160 --> 2:28:55.440]  and derivatives are allowed but the hook is this what's it gonna cost
[2:28:55.440 --> 2:29:00.400]  to clean up the sixth nation mess before between four and six trillion
[2:29:00.400 --> 2:29:06.080]  dollars they don't have that kind of money and even if they printed it
[2:29:06.080 --> 2:29:11.520]  inflation in europe would go ballistic and so uh you haven't seen the end of
[2:29:11.520 --> 2:29:14.080]  this thing yet
[2:29:15.120 --> 2:29:20.560]  but say grease leaves the euro it goes back to the drake mark it rebuilds its
[2:29:20.560 --> 2:29:24.560]  economy from the ground up you know it's a it's a haven for tourism it's
[2:29:24.560 --> 2:29:28.000]  possible that it could do that why are they so afraid
[2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:32.400]  of what would happen if grease was to leave the euro is it because it's going
[2:29:32.400 --> 2:29:35.120]  to be a domino effect for the whole euro zone
[2:29:35.120 --> 2:29:39.200]  we'll get your answer after the break bob because we're going to commercial now

[2:33:20.400 --> 2:33:24.320]  money bomb marathon special info wars money bomb dot com
[2:33:24.320 --> 2:33:28.400]  talking to bob Chapman of the international forecaster dot com
[2:33:28.400 --> 2:33:32.160]  bob just finishing up on the euro issue what happens
[2:33:32.160 --> 2:33:37.440]  if grease leaves the euro and why are the g20 elite so afraid of that
[2:33:37.440 --> 2:33:40.240]  possibility
[2:33:41.360 --> 2:33:44.880]  well i talked about this a couple of years ago on radio and television as
[2:33:44.880 --> 2:33:50.240]  well as in the press in greece and i told them that they should default in
[2:33:50.240 --> 2:33:54.480]  totality uh go to the jack marron devalue
[2:33:54.480 --> 2:34:00.640]  it versus the euro by 50 percent and clean up their act and not in five years
[2:34:00.640 --> 2:34:04.960]  they'd be out of the woods and uh i think that's the way it's
[2:34:04.960 --> 2:34:09.200]  going to end up they're playing this game that they've got going
[2:34:09.200 --> 2:34:14.400]  and uh not the greeks the uh the powers of europe will call them
[2:34:14.400 --> 2:34:17.760]  and again as i said at the beginning of the conversation
[2:34:17.760 --> 2:34:22.080]  uh saving the euro is extraordinarily important for them
[2:34:22.080 --> 2:34:25.920]  because once it's go goes then they have to reconfigure everything they're
[2:34:25.920 --> 2:34:30.400]  doing and doing on a national sovereign basis
[2:34:30.400 --> 2:34:35.040]  they won't be able to put the links in place to create their world government
[2:34:35.040 --> 2:34:38.320]  and that's really what they're up to and so
[2:34:38.320 --> 2:34:44.480]  uh if grease uh were to uh fail and it will in time because it can't
[2:34:44.480 --> 2:34:48.640]  carry carry carry that load and i don't think the people will cooperate
[2:34:48.640 --> 2:34:52.880]  uh they they are absolutely outraged and have been for two years
[2:34:52.880 --> 2:34:56.720]  and they'll be in the streets and uh they just won't play
[2:34:56.720 --> 2:35:00.000]  the revenants won't come in to pay the interest of the bonds
[2:35:00.000 --> 2:35:06.720]  but you're right uh paul uh the uh the look uh of all of this
[2:35:06.720 --> 2:35:11.280]  is we got to keep the euro together and uh
[2:35:11.280 --> 2:35:15.600]  and no matter what but they're really just buying time
[2:35:15.600 --> 2:35:20.000]  i think they know they're beyond the pale that they can't make it work
[2:35:20.000 --> 2:35:22.880]  and i think they've known this from the very beginning
[2:35:22.880 --> 2:35:27.120]  uh they should have never let the banks make the kind of loans that they did
[2:35:27.120 --> 2:35:30.800]  the banks didn't care they made the loans of out of money out of
[2:35:30.800 --> 2:35:34.720]  fanny air and expected the public to pay them back
[2:35:34.720 --> 2:35:38.160]  and that's essentially what's happening but i don't think it's going to
[2:35:38.160 --> 2:35:41.520]  continue to go on that way and that the grease
[2:35:41.520 --> 2:35:46.480]  would go bankrupt eventually uh three months six months down the line
[2:35:46.480 --> 2:35:50.480]  very possible and of course they would take
[2:35:50.480 --> 2:35:54.240]  ireland and portugal with them and ireland uh
[2:35:54.240 --> 2:35:58.640]  is a terrible mess the politicians have sold their people out
[2:35:58.640 --> 2:36:02.240]  and they were soon the the debts of the banks
[2:36:02.240 --> 2:36:06.880]  most of the foreign banks in ireland and the amount of money that they're on the
[2:36:06.880 --> 2:36:12.000]  hook for uh to pay interest on and guarantee the bonds
[2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:17.040]  is the farming on the capacity uh they'll be in the depression for
[2:36:17.040 --> 2:36:22.480]  20 30 years and so uh that uh grease going on to will
[2:36:22.480 --> 2:36:25.600]  will take the others with it and they're definitely afraid of that and they
[2:36:25.600 --> 2:36:29.520]  almost got to that point and they still may be at that point
[2:36:29.520 --> 2:36:35.360]  if bob andrayo loses the confidence vote because the next step step is uh
[2:36:35.360 --> 2:36:43.280]  snap election and getting back to the uh the people voting
[2:36:43.280 --> 2:36:48.560]  on uh whether to accept the package or not so the game isn't over yet and we
[2:36:48.560 --> 2:36:52.880]  don't have anything out of grease yet uh it's uh
[2:36:52.880 --> 2:36:56.320]  probably around eight eight o'clock at night there
[2:36:56.320 --> 2:37:00.240]  and so we should be getting something shortly
[2:37:00.240 --> 2:37:05.280]  okay switching gears for the moment story out today which is interested me
[2:37:05.280 --> 2:37:09.280]  HSBC customer customers are impacted by quote
[2:37:09.280 --> 2:37:12.960]  worldwide meltdown of all retail services
[2:37:12.960 --> 2:37:17.680]  now a few weeks ago we had problems with Bank of America ATMs
[2:37:17.680 --> 2:37:22.400]  um and now we have what's being dubbed a worldwide meltdown in which online
[2:37:22.400 --> 2:37:26.160]  banking ATMs and debit cards appear to have been blocked and no
[2:37:26.160 --> 2:37:31.200]  customer access is available and that's for HSBC customers obviously one of
[2:37:31.200 --> 2:37:34.720]  the biggest bankers in the world bob is this just
[2:37:34.720 --> 2:37:38.400]  technical gremlins or is there something deeper at work with all these
[2:37:38.400 --> 2:37:44.480]  ATM failures we've seen recently well it's very hard to say
[2:37:44.480 --> 2:37:48.080]  knowing the people that we're dealing with there is a possibility they would
[2:37:48.080 --> 2:37:51.920]  take the systems down over here and over there
[2:37:51.920 --> 2:37:55.360]  for a day or two to get the people warmed up
[2:37:55.360 --> 2:38:00.080]  to the fact that maybe uh that would happen again and maybe for a longer
[2:38:00.080 --> 2:38:03.760]  period of time as we all know they want to get people out of
[2:38:03.760 --> 2:38:08.400]  cash and into uh debit and credit cards in totality
[2:38:08.400 --> 2:38:11.680]  to be followed in some at some time in some way
[2:38:11.680 --> 2:38:17.440]  uh with uh uh using a chip and uh I don't think the people will ever
[2:38:17.440 --> 2:38:20.560]  stand for that but we don't know until we get there but I don't
[2:38:20.560 --> 2:38:26.080]  think it's anywhere in there and imminent but um I can't venture a
[2:38:26.080 --> 2:38:30.320]  guess on HSBC system going down and it is
[2:38:30.320 --> 2:38:34.160]  extensive it's all over the world
[2:38:34.640 --> 2:38:38.560]  well it's interesting because last year we had the article where
[2:38:38.560 --> 2:38:42.880]  city group was sending out an advisory to its customers where basically it
[2:38:42.880 --> 2:38:45.840]  said we reserve the right although it's not in
[2:38:45.840 --> 2:38:49.440]  place we reserve the right to require seven days
[2:38:49.440 --> 2:38:53.120]  advance notice before permitting a withdrawal from all
[2:38:53.120 --> 2:38:57.360]  checking accounts so they've got these rules and regulations on the books which
[2:38:57.360 --> 2:39:00.880]  you agree to when you sign up for a checking account with them
[2:39:00.880 --> 2:39:05.360]  where they can say right you want you want to withdraw a thousand dollars
[2:39:05.360 --> 2:39:08.560]  you're going to have to wait a week so it seems to me that definitely
[2:39:08.560 --> 2:39:13.600]  preparing for this day when if this financial collapse does come and it
[2:39:13.600 --> 2:39:17.040]  comes down quickly then they're going to have massive restrictions on people
[2:39:17.040 --> 2:39:20.720]  withdrawing cash to in their words prevent panic so
[2:39:20.720 --> 2:39:23.280]  it's very interesting to see how that develops
[2:39:23.280 --> 2:39:29.280]  um on the jobs figures um the phony unemployment figure which isn't even
[2:39:29.280 --> 2:39:33.840]  the real number has dropped by 0.1 percent today
[2:39:33.840 --> 2:39:38.240]  and the talking point is quote things are so bad this looks good
[2:39:38.240 --> 2:39:46.400]  I mean Bob is this 0.1 percent drop a cause for a big celebration
[2:39:47.200 --> 2:39:52.240]  well of course not and uh employment hasn't come down they just making mouse
[2:39:52.240 --> 2:39:55.840]  there a birth-death ratio figures again
[2:39:55.840 --> 2:39:59.360]  and that is the birth of and the death of businesses
[2:39:59.360 --> 2:40:03.040]  and government guesses of that every month that has for a long time
[2:40:03.040 --> 2:40:06.880]  and it's an excuse to create jobs that were never created
[2:40:06.880 --> 2:40:14.720]  and they do it all the time and uh what you got to look at it as uh is uh
[2:40:14.720 --> 2:40:19.680]  m6 the figure you just referred to nine percent
[2:40:19.680 --> 2:40:24.400]  is m3 that's short term unemployment you've got the others
[2:40:24.400 --> 2:40:29.040]  in there one two three and four and five with six being the total
[2:40:29.040 --> 2:40:33.840]  six including the birth-death ratio and I don't know what today's figure is but
[2:40:33.840 --> 2:40:40.320]  it was 16 and five eight percent unemployment now if you
[2:40:40.320 --> 2:40:45.040]  remove the birth-death ratio you get 22.6 percent
[2:40:45.040 --> 2:40:48.720]  and so that's really where the unemployment rate is and
[2:40:48.720 --> 2:40:53.920]  that's why people uh subscribe to my publication to see what the real number
[2:40:53.920 --> 2:40:59.280]  is or John Williams who's the best at figuring all that stuff out
[2:40:59.280 --> 2:41:03.360]  and uh the government uh is not getting away
[2:41:03.360 --> 2:41:06.400]  with what they're doing but on the other hand unfortunately
[2:41:06.400 --> 2:41:10.400]  everybody isn't listening to what we're telling them
[2:41:10.400 --> 2:41:17.840]  about this figure nine percent that comes across on all the wire services
[2:41:17.840 --> 2:41:21.280]  and on the television programs and everybody believes it because they
[2:41:21.280 --> 2:41:24.320]  don't know any better and they're not expected to know
[2:41:24.320 --> 2:41:30.080]  any better unless they listen to programs like Alex Jones
[2:41:30.800 --> 2:41:33.680]  now we've been talking at length on this show
[2:41:33.680 --> 2:41:38.480]  certainly about the war fussing the israel the u.s and the united kingdom
[2:41:38.480 --> 2:41:41.600]  have put themselves on regarding an attack on
[2:41:41.600 --> 2:41:45.520]  iran within the next 12 months we've got the article up at prison planet and
[2:41:45.520 --> 2:41:49.600]  info wars.com right now which is obama tells allies
[2:41:49.600 --> 2:41:55.760]  us will attack iran by fall 2012 and basically that's out of debka file which
[2:41:55.760 --> 2:41:58.720]  is a an israeli intelligence outlet which has
[2:41:58.720 --> 2:42:02.160]  been proven accurate in the past they predicted
[2:42:02.160 --> 2:42:06.720]  almost precisely when the libya conflict would be wound up when nator would go
[2:42:06.720 --> 2:42:10.800]  in and attack triply and then obviously immediately after gadafi went
[2:42:10.800 --> 2:42:13.520]  on the run so they've been proven accurate in the
[2:42:13.520 --> 2:42:16.560]  past and now they're saying that immediately after
[2:42:16.560 --> 2:42:20.080]  nator wound down operations on monday and libya that
[2:42:20.080 --> 2:42:24.880]  obama told germany italy israel and saudi arabia that
[2:42:24.880 --> 2:42:29.040]  if iran does not give up its nuclear they call it nuclear
[2:42:29.040 --> 2:42:32.640]  weaponization program they have the only evidence that's really being
[2:42:32.640 --> 2:42:37.440]  presented is that it's for energy if they don't give up that program
[2:42:37.440 --> 2:42:41.520]  by september 2012 because they're afraid they'll move it
[2:42:41.520 --> 2:42:44.880]  underground and they won't be able to bomb it out of existence
[2:42:44.880 --> 2:42:49.600]  then obama has given the green light for this invasion of course we had
[2:42:49.600 --> 2:42:54.160]  yesterday the former israeli intelligence chiefs out of mosad and shin
[2:42:54.160 --> 2:42:57.360]  bet came out that they're basically leaking
[2:42:57.360 --> 2:43:01.440]  information about these attack plans in a bid to derail them
[2:43:01.440 --> 2:43:06.560]  and in an effort to bring down net and yahoo take him out of office before he
[2:43:06.560 --> 2:43:10.880]  can oversee this so we've got massive war footing we've got
[2:43:10.880 --> 2:43:15.440]  anecdotal reports alex jones said his cousin told him the same thing i've
[2:43:15.440 --> 2:43:19.040]  seen other reports of us troops being sent to q8
[2:43:19.040 --> 2:43:23.280]  this is supposedly a after the withdrawal from iraq it's about
[2:43:23.280 --> 2:43:30.480]  rearranging us forces in the persian gulf specifically for targeting iran
[2:43:30.480 --> 2:43:36.720]  now bob i mean if it comes to pass and that we do see this attack on iran in
[2:43:36.720 --> 2:43:40.160]  the next 12 months and it escalates in the region
[2:43:40.160 --> 2:43:43.600]  what's the economic impact going to be are we going to see another rush to
[2:43:43.600 --> 2:43:49.280]  safety with the gold and the dollar or could it cause even greater problems
[2:43:49.280 --> 2:43:54.560]  well i think the the immediate effect would be on a price of oil
[2:43:54.560 --> 2:43:58.560]  and that would be followed by gold and silver and commodities
[2:43:58.560 --> 2:44:03.920]  the stock market would go down i would think that the bond market which would
[2:44:03.920 --> 2:44:08.080]  usually be somewhat buoyant would probably be
[2:44:08.080 --> 2:44:12.960]  relatively unchanged the u.s. government will be in the markets
[2:44:12.960 --> 2:44:17.200]  trying to manipulate them as they always do now
[2:44:17.200 --> 2:44:24.400]  legally and so it'll be a hard fight for commodities gold and silver to move up
[2:44:24.400 --> 2:44:28.480]  but they will and they're going to try to save the
[2:44:28.480 --> 2:44:34.400]  wall street market and and the bond market which is a hundred times bigger
[2:44:34.400 --> 2:44:38.800]  and that won't last very long i think they'll go down
[2:44:38.800 --> 2:44:46.480]  and the yields will increase on bonds because that's a very very difficult
[2:44:46.480 --> 2:44:52.080]  event you know they continue to use the
[2:44:52.080 --> 2:45:00.640]  the ability to use lightning strikes of and large amounts of munitions to
[2:45:00.640 --> 2:45:05.280]  accomplish what they want to do and if they don't if they do attack aran
[2:45:05.280 --> 2:45:11.600]  and they don't have aran in a difficult position within two or three weeks
[2:45:11.600 --> 2:45:16.480]  that could last for years and maybe rusher and
[2:45:16.480 --> 2:45:20.000]  china might get involved we don't know and so
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:26.160]  uh yes they probably will do that when they will do it i don't know
[2:45:26.160 --> 2:45:31.040]  but it's been on the plate for a long time and a lot of people have projected
[2:45:31.040 --> 2:45:35.120]  different date periods and they've all been wrong obviously
[2:45:35.120 --> 2:45:39.440]  and uh you shouldn't do that because you don't know
[2:45:39.440 --> 2:45:43.120]  i mean unless you work for the miss out of the cia
[2:45:43.120 --> 2:45:48.800]  and so you'll just have to be happy with the projection that it's going to
[2:45:48.800 --> 2:45:52.960]  happen in all probability but we don't know when but over the
[2:45:52.960 --> 2:45:57.040]  next year looks like a possible time
[2:45:57.760 --> 2:46:02.160]  now i saw an interesting video earlier this week and it got a lot of attention
[2:46:02.160 --> 2:46:08.480]  and that was peter schiff representing the quote one percent he went down to
[2:46:08.480 --> 2:46:12.240]  occupy wall street and he basically confronted the protesters and he was
[2:46:12.240 --> 2:46:15.600]  saying look you know i've got a company that employs
[2:46:15.600 --> 2:46:20.480]  150 people how many people do you employ and he was trying to make the point to
[2:46:20.480 --> 2:46:23.840]  them that many of the occupy wall street protesters
[2:46:23.840 --> 2:46:29.280]  are calling for solutions that would not target the super rich elite but would
[2:46:29.280 --> 2:46:33.120]  cripple the american middle class and middle class businesses
[2:46:33.120 --> 2:46:37.760]  by supporting this warren buffet tax plan which is also advocated by the
[2:46:37.760 --> 2:46:40.880]  obama administration which wouldn't even affect
[2:46:40.880 --> 2:46:44.320]  the top one percent it will hide their wealth in offshore accounts
[2:46:44.320 --> 2:46:47.280]  it would affect the american middle class and real
[2:46:47.280 --> 2:46:52.720]  businesses that employ american people bob if you could go down there to occupy
[2:46:52.720 --> 2:46:56.880]  wall street what would you say to these protesters who in
[2:46:56.880 --> 2:47:02.960]  many cases are arguing for solutions that would lead to more draconian
[2:47:02.960 --> 2:47:07.200]  worse economic conditions for most american citizens than is already the
[2:47:07.200 --> 2:47:11.600]  case what would you say to occupy wall street
[2:47:11.600 --> 2:47:16.400]  it doesn't work and their manifesto of answers looks like it was written by
[2:47:16.400 --> 2:47:19.760]  carl marx but that's only the segment that
[2:47:19.760 --> 2:47:25.680]  is running the thing you have a very well this is an equal amount of people
[2:47:25.680 --> 2:47:29.120]  now participating that are telling people who are there that
[2:47:29.120 --> 2:47:33.200]  doesn't work and here's why it doesn't and we got to get rid of the fed reserve
[2:47:33.200 --> 2:47:36.880]  and yes wall street are a bunch of criminals
[2:47:36.880 --> 2:47:41.120]  i mean we just had a company go under yesterday
[2:47:41.120 --> 2:47:48.640]  and they're missing a billion or about a billion and a quarter or 700 million
[2:47:48.640 --> 2:47:52.720]  million dollars and this sort of thing goes on
[2:47:52.720 --> 2:47:58.800]  frequently and so yes there has to be changes of wall street
[2:47:58.800 --> 2:48:03.360]  and the changes have to start with the sec and the cftc
[2:48:03.360 --> 2:48:07.440]  the regulatory arms of the government because they just do what the government
[2:48:07.440 --> 2:48:11.920]  tells them to do and the big firms very seldom get touched
[2:48:11.920 --> 2:48:19.360]  and if anything they might get a a a fine and have the hand slapped
[2:48:19.360 --> 2:48:23.200]  when they're stealing billions of dollars it's credible
[2:48:23.200 --> 2:48:32.960]  and so the the things started off being funded by people i think
[2:48:32.960 --> 2:48:39.120]  who wanted to turn into a confrontation which would lead to violence
[2:48:39.120 --> 2:48:43.200]  and then martial law that's what i think what they were up to
[2:48:43.200 --> 2:48:46.960]  and that's why a lot of those old old-time communists
[2:48:46.960 --> 2:48:52.400]  are in there some of whom i met know uh for the 60s
[2:48:52.400 --> 2:48:56.480]  and uh they've been neutralized i think the public
[2:48:56.480 --> 2:49:00.240]  has gotten into the ranks and they've neutralized it to a great extent
[2:49:00.240 --> 2:49:06.800]  and i'm happy about that okay we're going to go to the break shortly but
[2:49:06.800 --> 2:49:09.760]  going to come back with bob Chapman for the final segment
[2:49:09.760 --> 2:49:14.800]  again i want to direct people to info wars moneybomb.com we're in the final
[2:49:14.800 --> 2:49:20.960]  10 minutes of the donation drive today again as i've said before
[2:49:20.960 --> 2:49:24.720]  you know we're not funded by george saurus we're not funded by the carnage
[2:49:24.720 --> 2:49:28.080]  institute we don't get handouts from these kind of people
[2:49:28.080 --> 2:49:32.640]  we're completely funded by our listeners and our readers and this is how we've
[2:49:32.640 --> 2:49:36.240]  been able to challenge the establishment media
[2:49:36.240 --> 2:49:40.160]  particularly over the past two years with building the tv studio
[2:49:40.160 --> 2:49:43.600]  and reaching more people than ever we get more
[2:49:43.600 --> 2:49:49.920]  traffic to info wars.com than msnbc.com for example which of course is
[2:49:49.920 --> 2:49:54.960]  funded by general electric and where not which is why we need your support
[2:49:54.960 --> 2:50:00.240]  but that just illustrates really how how many people we've been able to reach
[2:50:00.240 --> 2:50:05.520]  on an independent media platform that does not get handouts from
[2:50:05.520 --> 2:50:10.080]  NGOs or billionaire philanthropists as many of the
[2:50:10.080 --> 2:50:14.640]  leftist foundation websites do like moveon.org
[2:50:14.640 --> 2:50:18.720]  think progress and media matters and of course we get more traffic than all of
[2:50:18.720 --> 2:50:23.120]  them as well because at least we try to tell the truth and our message is not
[2:50:23.120 --> 2:50:27.520]  poisoned by political influencers from either the left
[2:50:27.520 --> 2:50:32.000]  or the right. We're going to take a break shortly we're going to get back to bob
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:37.760]  Chapman again the major issue at the moment on info wars.com is this
[2:50:37.760 --> 2:50:41.760]  upcoming attack in iran. Earlier i was talking to brian
[2:50:41.760 --> 2:50:46.320]  garish about how the israeli lobbies have actually
[2:50:46.320 --> 2:50:52.000]  got in with bbc and sky news editors and made them quote change their narrative
[2:50:52.000 --> 2:50:54.560]  on israel in iran so we're going to see a lot more of that
[2:50:54.560 --> 2:51:02.640]  an article big article on that coming up stay tuned infosmoneybomb.com

[2:54:15.600 --> 2:54:18.800]  the end and we're talking to bob Chapman of the
[2:54:18.800 --> 2:54:23.680]  international forecaster dot com uh bob tell people how they can
[2:54:23.680 --> 2:54:27.680]  subscribe to the international forecaster
[2:54:27.680 --> 2:54:32.800]  well the easiest way is probably to get a hold of
[2:54:32.800 --> 2:54:38.160]  the people at mitis and that number is 877
[2:54:38.160 --> 2:54:46.480]  479-8178 that's 877-479-8178 that's toll-free
[2:54:46.480 --> 2:54:50.720]  and they will send you a copy either of the
[2:54:50.720 --> 2:54:54.560]  email version or the hardcore hard copy version
[2:54:54.560 --> 2:54:58.000]  or the international forecaster and they also have
[2:54:58.000 --> 2:55:03.440]  uh a offering for a full one year free subscription
[2:55:03.440 --> 2:55:07.440]  and the deal that they're offering i think is terrific
[2:55:07.440 --> 2:55:11.200]  we have many many many people take advantage of it
[2:55:11.200 --> 2:55:16.320]  and it's the purchase of one coin i don't know the price of it today but i'll
[2:55:16.320 --> 2:55:22.640]  i guess at 360 dollars and uh if you do that and that's a very competitive price
[2:55:22.640 --> 2:55:25.760]  that they're offering them at uh you can get
[2:55:25.760 --> 2:55:30.080]  a free one year subscription so if you want to be a subscriber
[2:55:30.080 --> 2:55:33.920]  that's certainly an inexpensive way to do it
[2:55:34.640 --> 2:55:38.160]  now i mean we've got all this financial turmoil
[2:55:38.160 --> 2:55:44.720]  swirling how can people best protect their wealth what can they do to thrive
[2:55:44.720 --> 2:55:49.520]  and prosper even in these difficult times bob
[2:55:49.520 --> 2:55:53.680]  there's only one way and that's to buy gold and silver coins,
[2:55:53.680 --> 2:55:58.880]  bullion and shares and that's it i've been in the markets for 53 years
[2:55:58.880 --> 2:56:02.000]  i owned my own brokerage firm for for many years
[2:56:02.000 --> 2:56:07.920]  i was a wall street for almost 30 years and now i have a second evocation
[2:56:07.920 --> 2:56:11.440]  for 23 years which is writing the international forecaster
[2:56:11.440 --> 2:56:17.280]  but uh that is the only way markets will go up and down there'll be a lot of
[2:56:17.280 --> 2:56:21.280]  volatility but if you look at history you'll see
[2:56:21.280 --> 2:56:24.560]  that it is the only way for you to preserve your wealth
[2:56:24.560 --> 2:56:28.080]  and that's really what you're trying to do if you happen to make money at it
[2:56:28.080 --> 2:56:32.080]  well that's fine but that's not the intention
[2:56:32.080 --> 2:56:35.920]  the intention is wealth preservation
[2:56:36.720 --> 2:56:43.040]  and i mean gold's taken a breather it went up past 1800 it's back 1750
[2:56:43.040 --> 2:56:46.800]  when do you envisage the 2000 level is it going to be
[2:56:46.800 --> 2:56:50.400]  next year or before the end of the year bob
[2:56:50.400 --> 2:56:55.920]  i think very much so that it'll be 2000 to 2200 by the end of the year
[2:56:55.920 --> 2:57:00.080]  and usually january and february are very good months for gold
[2:57:00.080 --> 2:57:04.160]  and so with that said we have a shot at 2500 or higher
[2:57:04.160 --> 2:57:09.920]  maybe 3000 and you always have to remember that the government's your enemy
[2:57:09.920 --> 2:57:13.280]  because they're in rigging those markets all the time
[2:57:13.280 --> 2:57:16.400]  there are no free markets left and it's not only gold and silver
[2:57:16.400 --> 2:57:19.760]  but it's commodities and bonds and stocks
[2:57:19.760 --> 2:57:24.240]  worldwide and so uh you're going to have to contend with that
[2:57:24.240 --> 2:57:28.400]  and there's going to be a lot of volatility so expect it
[2:57:28.400 --> 2:57:32.480]  but there's nothing in which you can invest today
[2:57:32.480 --> 2:57:38.800]  that doesn't have volatility unless it's flat on its pants and you can take
[2:57:38.800 --> 2:57:42.640]  real estate as an example it's still going down it'll continue to go down
[2:57:42.640 --> 2:57:46.560]  it may not recover for 20 or 30 years so
[2:57:46.560 --> 2:57:50.080]  you really don't want to be there for any reason
[2:57:50.080 --> 2:57:57.600]  and so uh the safest place to be is in the gold and silver related venue
[2:57:57.600 --> 2:58:01.840]  hey guys uh alex jones here interrupting in customary fashion right at the end
[2:58:01.840 --> 2:58:04.800]  i want to thank bob Chapman i want to thank uh

[3:01:10.640 --> 3:01:13.200]  don't know what they're doing we were talking about
[3:01:13.200 --> 3:01:16.320]  airing the middle of the night first and then you know kind of mixing enough
[3:01:16.320 --> 3:01:19.680]  people that miss that uh we got a skull and bone special
[3:01:19.680 --> 3:01:24.560]  never before behind the scenes stuff with charlotte isreby
[3:01:24.560 --> 3:01:28.640]  yeah exactly and and and what the streams the streams and the links you've
[3:01:28.640 --> 3:01:34.000]  got that are on info wars.com will be dead for about uh 10 15 minutes
[3:01:34.000 --> 3:01:38.240]  15 to 30 and it'll all fire back up so those pages you have those video links
[3:01:38.240 --> 3:01:41.040]  again bob chatman's here with us i just want to point this out because i never
[3:01:41.040 --> 3:01:45.120]  really got up here and started pitching all this and i just had a lady who
[3:01:45.120 --> 3:01:48.640]  wanted to talk to me on the phone i'm about to leave folks so i can't talk
[3:01:48.640 --> 3:01:51.440]  and another fellow said he wanted to make a big donation and i think we wrote the
[3:01:51.440 --> 3:01:54.320]  number down wrong or something but whatever the point is
[3:01:54.320 --> 3:01:59.680]  is that i do not want people's little donations if you don't have the money
[3:01:59.680 --> 3:02:02.400]  if you're worth 10 million dollars i want to give me five dollars that's great
[3:02:02.400 --> 3:02:05.520]  we appreciate it thank you or spread the word about the show or buy my dvds and
[3:02:05.520 --> 3:02:08.560]  make copies get a lot of people it's all about getting the word out
[3:02:08.560 --> 3:02:11.760]  but you see red macomes you guys find that article i saw last week in the
[3:02:11.760 --> 3:02:16.400]  newspaper six million dollars red macomes i think the headline was
[3:02:16.400 --> 3:02:18.400]  donors because it was two of macones one other
[3:02:18.400 --> 3:02:22.400]  get gave six million dollars for the lacrosse and football program
[3:02:22.400 --> 3:02:28.160]  of the university north of austin up in um i've been up there at georgetown
[3:02:28.160 --> 3:02:31.360]  what's the name of the university again southwestern my memory's not working
[3:02:31.360 --> 3:02:34.240]  right now i normally would know that i have friends that went there it's great
[3:02:34.240 --> 3:02:38.960]  school i'm told the point is six million for football i can see six million for
[3:02:38.960 --> 3:02:42.320]  a planetarium to study you know astronomy or
[3:02:42.320 --> 3:02:46.000]  six million for nuclear physics or six million for
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:02:50.320]  you know whatever uh or a second amendment foundation or something but
[3:02:50.320 --> 3:02:54.560]  six million for football i mean this is just ridiculous
[3:02:54.560 --> 3:02:58.880]  so in closing i want to hit our goal of five hundred thousand because then i
[3:02:58.880 --> 3:03:02.640]  could really hire a bunch of people you know reporters crew really kick butt
[3:03:02.640 --> 3:03:06.080]  i have a budget for travel that's what really kills us
[3:03:06.080 --> 3:03:08.960]  but if you go to info wars money bomb dot com we've raised over three hundred
[3:03:08.960 --> 3:03:11.600]  thousand and usually more trickles in over the next four or five days i think
[3:03:11.600 --> 3:03:14.960]  we'll hit 350 or so but info wars money bomb dot com
[3:03:14.960 --> 3:03:19.920]  uh a comment on donating to worthy causes the system scared of us pooling
[3:03:19.920 --> 3:03:25.520]  our money together and actually building an alternative media system bob
[3:03:25.520 --> 3:03:28.320]  and they should be
[3:03:28.960 --> 3:03:34.160]  this part public certainly isn't getting the truth uh on the mainline media and
[3:03:34.160 --> 3:03:38.720]  they know that they want an alternative and were you able to do that
[3:03:38.720 --> 3:03:44.480]  uh it certainly would be inviting uh i'm sure who would also bring all
[3:03:44.480 --> 3:03:48.880]  kinds of further harassment and uh you know the way
[3:03:48.880 --> 3:03:54.400]  they've attacked the station before but uh they're terrified and they
[3:03:54.400 --> 3:03:57.120]  should be yeah here it is red mccown supporting
[3:03:57.120 --> 3:04:00.320]  efforts to bring football back to southwestern
[3:04:00.320 --> 3:04:04.240]  and uh it's a total of six million dollars
[3:04:04.240 --> 3:04:08.560]  for that and lacrosse uh women's lacrosse i mean give me a break
[3:04:08.560 --> 3:04:11.840]  this country's going to hell in a handbasket 15 million kids are starving
[3:04:11.840 --> 3:04:16.160]  to death a year this is obscene and it's his money he can do what he wants with
[3:04:16.160 --> 3:04:20.480]  it but that's who i'm calling on it's the rich people out there
[3:04:20.480 --> 3:04:24.320]  i mean i don't understand it you're mad about what's happening but
[3:04:24.320 --> 3:04:28.640]  we're the tip of the spear and i you know i don't see as many big donations this
[3:04:28.640 --> 3:04:31.360]  year as we've seen in past i've seen a lot of little ones
[3:04:31.360 --> 3:04:34.560]  and uh quite frankly i don't like little donations of people that don't have
[3:04:34.560 --> 3:04:38.160]  money because then i worry about when i'm spending it that i do it do it just
[3:04:38.160 --> 3:04:41.440]  right make the right decision it's all of you rich people out there need to

[3:06:01.360 --> 3:06:06.800]  hello i'm alex jones
[3:06:13.520 --> 3:06:16.480]  cats like me and you
[3:06:16.480 --> 3:06:21.120]  have got laws
[3:06:32.800 --> 3:06:37.360]  okay folks um again i meant to end the money bomb as we hit the 27th hour but
[3:06:37.360 --> 3:06:40.320]  now internet only video streams info wars.com
[3:06:40.320 --> 3:06:42.800]  audio streams uh we're back for just a few minutes
[3:06:42.800 --> 3:06:45.760]  finishing up with paul because i didn't hear music going out
[3:06:45.760 --> 3:06:48.720]  and so we kind of butchered that break but 27 hours in you're going to start
[3:06:48.720 --> 3:06:54.480]  doing stuff like that um my point is that the government takes your
[3:06:54.480 --> 3:06:59.440]  money and then uses it against you and
[3:06:59.440 --> 3:07:03.200]  then as people have less then they even give less
[3:07:03.200 --> 3:07:07.040]  to their own families or to their church or to their community
[3:07:07.040 --> 3:07:10.320]  and that's why the globalist want to impoverish society so people don't have
[3:07:10.320 --> 3:07:13.280]  money to give it to political or media organizations
[3:07:13.280 --> 3:07:16.320]  and we're building an alternative media george soros gives all these tens of
[3:07:16.320 --> 3:07:20.400]  millions to groups like uh media matters to just spew
[3:07:20.400 --> 3:07:25.600]  lies and twisted disinformation and other prattle and spittle at us
[3:07:25.600 --> 3:07:29.840]  which is great it's a it's a badge of honor but again people like soros a lot
[3:07:29.840 --> 3:07:33.280]  of that's money he's gotten out of all sorts of global swindles and
[3:07:33.280 --> 3:07:36.080]  he couldn't even overturn his conviction in france that came out a few weeks
[3:07:36.080 --> 3:07:39.520]  ago and it's just disgusting so that's why we
[3:07:39.520 --> 3:07:42.400]  do this because the system always freaks out my gosh people that are into
[3:07:42.400 --> 3:07:45.360]  liberty are selling videos and writing books
[3:07:45.360 --> 3:07:48.960]  oh my gosh don't you know you know don't don't educate people politically
[3:07:48.960 --> 3:07:52.320]  while funding yourself that's dirty it's only good to take money
[3:07:52.320 --> 3:07:56.480]  at gunpoint as government and give it to you know the msnbc to spew anti gun
[3:07:56.480 --> 3:07:58.960]  garbage i can tell you we're having a national
[3:07:58.960 --> 3:08:02.960]  effect we're having a global effect we're having a bigger and bigger effect
[3:08:02.960 --> 3:08:06.960]  all the time in fact it's scary and i know we have a responsibility to go to
[3:08:06.960 --> 3:08:09.200]  the next level so in four wars money bomb dot
[3:08:09.200 --> 3:08:13.520]  com or 888-253-3139 because man i tell you
[3:08:13.520 --> 3:08:16.000]  they're like this person really wants to talk to you i got a phone it's a really
[3:08:16.000 --> 3:08:19.280]  nice lady and then i have the idea oh my gosh the
[3:08:19.280 --> 3:08:23.280]  red mccones thing i forgot to make that point and so i run back in and say put
[3:08:23.280 --> 3:08:26.160]  me back on right as the main show's ending put me back on
[3:08:26.160 --> 3:08:30.400]  because i meant to cover this the entire time this was going to be my pitch
[3:08:30.400 --> 3:08:33.520]  my pitch is always what i believe in the truth i mean i was going to get a bunch
[3:08:33.520 --> 3:08:37.040]  of examples of people giving i've seen 10 million dollar gifts to the two football
[3:08:37.040 --> 3:08:39.840]  programs and here it is i mean red mccones
[3:08:39.840 --> 3:08:44.480]  six million bucks i mean it's just un unbelievable
[3:08:44.480 --> 3:08:47.120]  but that's his money he can do what he wants with it
[3:08:47.120 --> 3:08:50.480]  i have first amendment right to say that's ridiculous that's why football
[3:08:50.480 --> 3:08:53.680]  makes me sick in sports where it's it's the god
[3:08:53.680 --> 3:08:57.920]  i'll tell you this i had six million dollars to give away
[3:08:57.920 --> 3:09:01.040]  i would create my own second amendment foundation
[3:09:01.040 --> 3:09:04.320]  that did things like educate and would also try to fundraise so you can keep
[3:09:04.320 --> 3:09:08.560]  doing it and it would sue government when it violates people's rights
[3:09:08.560 --> 3:09:13.760]  oh you know a literal guard dog an attack dog on the establishment
[3:09:13.760 --> 3:09:18.880]  uh i would um well that's six million dollars i do what i've done here
[3:09:18.880 --> 3:09:21.840]  in the last three years we've been spending three four five million a year
[3:09:21.840 --> 3:09:25.920]  or four and a half million so i guess i mean just the last four years 15 million
[3:09:25.920 --> 3:09:28.880]  dollars i mean it's a pretty big organization
[3:09:28.880 --> 3:09:33.280]  uh and i've got a hustle that's 15 million dollars wow
[3:09:33.280 --> 3:09:36.880]  i mean that's a lot of money so we talk about it trying to raise a half million
[3:09:36.880 --> 3:09:41.040]  uh it takes a lot to have 30 employees and and contractors and
[3:09:41.040 --> 3:09:46.000]  50 thousand and 60 thousand dollar it bills just for bandwidth a month and
[3:09:46.000 --> 3:09:50.000]  16 thousand dollar rent and all the equipment and all the garbage
[3:09:50.000 --> 3:09:53.840]  and and then we we fly in the system even though we know the fellow reserves of
[3:09:53.840 --> 3:09:57.680]  fraud the IRS is their collection agency i pay the stinking taxes
[3:09:57.680 --> 3:10:01.280]  and boy do we pay them because people like well then it's going to that well
[3:10:01.280 --> 3:10:04.720]  i mean we we buy equipment and got to pay taxes on it it's pure
[3:10:04.720 --> 3:10:09.200]  bull and so um
[3:10:09.200 --> 3:10:12.320]  when we have these money bombs it can go right to those employees and they're
[3:10:12.320 --> 3:10:16.400]  nailed down for the year it can go right to the equipment we need
[3:10:16.400 --> 3:10:19.040]  and it's just so great so info wars money bomb com
[3:10:19.040 --> 3:10:22.880]  paul i want you to close it out here uh for three or four minutes i'm going to
[3:10:22.880 --> 3:10:26.160]  say sayonara everybody but comment on what i've just talked about and what i've
[3:10:26.160 --> 3:10:29.440]  said i mean it's because people don't see themselves as active
[3:10:29.440 --> 3:10:33.280]  participants fighting tyranny and it's somebody else's job that's why we've
[3:10:33.280 --> 3:10:36.480]  gotten in this position oh and i know why we went to even super
[3:10:36.480 --> 3:10:42.400]  overdrive here 27 plus hours now uh ventura the other big facet is
[3:10:42.400 --> 3:10:45.600]  ventura was not allowed to see the ruling it was called national security
[3:10:45.600 --> 3:10:49.280]  so now i mean you have the same jury system in england
[3:10:49.280 --> 3:10:54.240]  uh so this is where the common law came from you know 12 12 15
[3:10:54.240 --> 3:10:58.640]  paul you know they told him and his lawyer you can't see it it's national
[3:10:58.640 --> 3:11:01.840]  security and you don't even get to have a jury trial in america over the fourth
[3:11:01.840 --> 3:11:05.600]  amendment i mean that is marshal law that is star chamber that is
[3:11:05.600 --> 3:11:08.400]  that is unbelievable so that's going to be a powerful article you're going to get
[3:11:08.400 --> 3:11:12.160]  out and uh great job my friend but what's your view on the money bomb and
[3:11:12.160 --> 3:11:15.680]  being with now almost what is it 10 years now it is 10 years
[3:11:15.680 --> 3:11:19.600]  that you've been uh in the info war my friend
[3:11:19.600 --> 3:11:23.200]  well back in 2005 you remember we visited
[3:11:23.200 --> 3:11:27.600]  when you were at the old studio and even back then i mean we were hard
[3:11:27.600 --> 3:11:31.200]  working and focused and we were having an impact but
[3:11:31.200 --> 3:11:37.200]  it was literally what five or six people employees
[3:11:37.200 --> 3:11:42.080]  now it's like it's grown so much just over the course of the past six or seven
[3:11:42.080 --> 3:11:44.640]  years and that's because people have supported us
[3:11:44.640 --> 3:11:49.760]  and that's why info wars dot com gets more traffic than msnbc dot com
[3:11:49.760 --> 3:11:53.600]  because everything that our supporters have poured into it
[3:11:53.600 --> 3:11:57.600]  we've in turn poured back into the information war
[3:11:57.600 --> 3:12:01.520]  that's why hillary clinton says that they're losing the information war
[3:12:01.520 --> 3:12:04.480]  because you're right in the meanwhile paul and then i am punching out letting
[3:12:04.480 --> 3:12:07.360]  you finish feds worried hackers can open prison
[3:12:07.360 --> 3:12:11.120]  doors they want to pass cyber security that's made up terror scarlet post

[3:13:14.720 --> 3:13:19.600]  spent right half of these charities that we donate to you research them and it
[3:13:19.600 --> 3:13:22.480]  turns out you know they keep off the money
[3:13:22.480 --> 3:13:26.240]  the ceo is getting paid millions of dollars a year
[3:13:26.240 --> 3:13:30.000]  and that's why people have you know they try to focus on charities that they
[3:13:30.000 --> 3:13:33.920]  know and organizations that they know will do good work and that's where their
[3:13:33.920 --> 3:13:37.680]  money goes and so that's why we appeal to people to support
[3:13:37.680 --> 3:13:42.720]  info wars money bomb dot com as i said we're not funded by
[3:13:42.720 --> 3:13:48.800]  billionaire philanthropists george soros doesn't hand us five million dollars
[3:13:48.800 --> 3:13:53.760]  to spew propaganda about how everybody's racist and violent if they oppose
[3:13:53.760 --> 3:13:58.080]  obama care and stuff like that and i mean we're regularly attacked by these
[3:13:58.080 --> 3:14:01.680]  people who are funded by the likes of soros that's where the money goes is
[3:14:01.680 --> 3:14:05.360]  basically to attack us and other patriot organizations
[3:14:05.360 --> 3:14:08.400]  so all we're doing is asking for our supporters
[3:14:08.400 --> 3:14:13.040]  to give us give us that firepower where we can strike back and we can rise above
[3:14:13.040 --> 3:14:15.440]  and we already are rising above because
[3:14:15.440 --> 3:14:18.720]  we're defeating all of them in terms of traffic
[3:14:18.720 --> 3:14:22.480]  we're defeating them in terms of activism and grassroots people really
[3:14:22.480 --> 3:14:25.920]  getting out there and having an impact rather than constant
[3:14:25.920 --> 3:14:29.360]  backbiting and infighting with each other
[3:14:29.360 --> 3:14:32.400]  we're actually trying to get the issues on the front burner
[3:14:32.400 --> 3:14:35.920]  of the national agenda and of course that's exemplified
[3:14:35.920 --> 3:14:39.760]  no better than with the presidential campaign of congressman
[3:14:39.760 --> 3:14:45.360]  ron paul which is basically now what we're a platform for in the political
[3:14:45.360 --> 3:14:48.400]  sense going forward into 2012 because they're growing
[3:14:48.400 --> 3:14:51.760]  there are going to be many more attacks against congressman paul and they're
[3:14:51.760 --> 3:14:55.200]  going to try and derail his momentum as a top
[3:14:55.200 --> 3:15:00.160]  tier candidate as he is right now and so we're going to be fully committed
[3:15:00.160 --> 3:15:04.400]  to that fight in the info war which according to none other than hillary
[3:15:04.400 --> 3:15:07.760]  clinton we're winning and they're losing
