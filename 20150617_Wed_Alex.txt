[00:00:00.402 --> 00:00:01.444]  Brother.
[00:00:01.444 --> 00:00:03.226]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:03.226 --> 00:00:04.988]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:04.988 --> 00:00:06.571]  You want answers?
[00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:08.113]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:08.113 --> 00:00:12.319]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:16.364]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.494 --> 00:00:29.155]  So what do you say about the influence?
[00:00:29.155 --> 00:00:30.796]  I mean, there's very powerful people there.
[00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:32.717]  Why does it have to be so secret?
[00:00:32.717 --> 00:00:34.337]  I mean... There is no secrecy.
[00:00:34.337 --> 00:00:37.258]  It's... There's absolutely no secrecy.
[00:00:37.258 --> 00:00:38.419]  I talked to the hotel guys.
[00:00:38.419 --> 00:00:39.899]  It's just a private meeting.
[00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:50.044]  If you want to know the evils lurking within the Bilderberg Group, look no further than the following quotes from Bilderberg insiders and those who've studied the secretive cabal.
[00:00:50.044 --> 00:00:50.644]  Bill Gates.
[00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:55.008]  So you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero.
[00:00:55.008 --> 00:01:08.564]  And that's going to be based on the number of people, the services each person's using on average, the energy on average for each service, and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.
[00:01:08.564 --> 00:01:11.547]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
[00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:16.633]  That's back from high school algebra, but let's take a look.
[00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:21.994]  Dr. Henry Kissinger at the 1992 Bilderberg meeting at Evians, France.
[00:01:21.994 --> 00:01:27.055]  Today, America would be outraged if UN troops entered Los Angeles to restore order.
[00:01:27.055 --> 00:01:29.836]  Referring to the 1991 LA riots.
[00:01:29.836 --> 00:01:31.676]  Tomorrow, they will be grateful.
[00:01:31.676 --> 00:01:37.118]  This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond, i.e.
[00:01:37.118 --> 00:01:38.918]  an extraterrestrial invasion.
[00:01:39.238 --> 00:01:42.482]  Whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence.
[00:01:42.482 --> 00:01:46.986]  It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil.
[00:01:46.986 --> 00:01:49.709]  The one thing every man fears is the unknown.
[00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:57.718]  When presented with the scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the world government.
[00:01:58.098 --> 00:02:19.008]  David Rockefeller wrote in his book Memoirs, if the Council on Foreign Relations raises the hackles of the conspiracy theorists, the Bilderberg meetings must induce apocalyptic visions of omnipotent international bankers plotting with unscrupulous government officials to impose cunning schemes on an ignorant and unsuspecting world.
[00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:39.212]  At the 1991 Bilderberg meeting at Badon, Germany, a meeting also attended by Bill Clinton, David Rockefeller said, We are grateful to the Washington Post, the New York Times, Time Magazine, and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost 40 years.
[00:02:40.553 --> 00:02:47.981]  It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years.
[00:02:47.981 --> 00:02:52.786]  But the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government.
[00:02:52.786 --> 00:03:01.936]  The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past centuries.
[00:03:02.837 --> 00:03:06.358]  And David Rockefeller from his book, Memoirs, again.
[00:03:06.358 --> 00:03:21.302]  Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as internationalists, and conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure.
[00:03:21.302 --> 00:03:23.282]  One world, if you will.
[00:03:23.282 --> 00:03:26.503]  If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.
[00:03:26.923 --> 00:03:36.529]  Already we've seen leading members of Congress used to always attend the Speaker of the House of Representatives, ranking Senators would attend.
[00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:42.033]  Now they don't dare because they get mail from their own constituents.
[00:03:42.033 --> 00:03:47.376]  Voters in their own congressional district are in their home state from the Senators saying if you
[00:03:49.158 --> 00:03:54.121]  Do business with these criminals anymore, we'll never vote for you again.
[00:03:54.121 --> 00:03:56.503]  We'll vote for anybody else.
[00:03:56.503 --> 00:04:00.286]  And they've been politically frightened out of the ballgame.
[00:04:00.286 --> 00:04:09.953]  19th century politician and historian Lord Acton said the issue which has swept down the centuries and which will have to be fought sooner or later is the people
[00:04:10.613 --> 00:04:12.535]  Versus the Banks.
[00:04:12.535 --> 00:04:19.282]  The ruthless and cunning behavior of the attendees of the Bilderberg Conference can be summed up in the Machiavelli quote,
[00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:40.438]  We can see the ripples of secrecy in the Bilderberg group and that of President Obama's TPP and Adam Weishaupt, founder of the Illuminati's quote, the great strength of our order lies in its concealment.
[00:04:40.438 --> 00:04:42.219]  Let it never appear in any place.
[00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:51.363]  That is just half of the in-depth report, Bilderberg evil in their own words, that is on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:51.363 --> 00:04:52.584]  Big transmission coming up.
[00:04:53.993 --> 00:05:00.755]  You've probably heard that synthetic ingredients in your food could be harmful to your health, but what about the clothes on your back?
[00:05:00.755 --> 00:05:05.296]  In the article, The Hidden Toxins in Your Closet, Dr. Group breaks it down.
[00:05:05.296 --> 00:05:14.458]  Popular clothing stores like H&M, Levi's, and Gap are beginning to turn their attention toward producing healthier and more environmentally friendly clothing.
[00:05:14.998 --> 00:05:23.662]  Increased consumer awareness around the dangers of synthetic dyes as well as other things are fueling a drastic revolution in the fashion industry.
[00:05:23.662 --> 00:05:33.966]  Keeping in line with current trends, clothing retailers are finally attempting to appeal to health-conscious buyers as well as appease international health organizations.
[00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:39.208]  And as with any movement, the best way to have your voice heard is to vote with your dollars.
[00:05:39.788 --> 00:05:44.871]  Support companies who make clothing out of bamboo, organic cotton, or flax.
[00:05:44.871 --> 00:05:48.393]  And always choose clothes produced using natural dyes.
[00:05:48.393 --> 00:05:50.674]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com
[00:05:54.136 --> 00:05:59.881]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:05:59.881 --> 00:06:14.314]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:22.578]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:06:22.578 --> 00:06:28.060]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.702]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:06:31.702 --> 00:06:35.844]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:06:35.844 --> 00:06:39.706]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:06:40.146 --> 00:06:44.288]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.

[00:06:52.672 --> 00:07:04.158]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[00:07:04.358 --> 00:07:11.463]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:07:11.463 --> 00:07:16.346]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:07:16.346 --> 00:07:19.988]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[00:07:21.209 --> 00:07:22.009]  We're good to go.
[00:07:45.183 --> 00:07:51.464]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:07:51.464 --> 00:08:05.387]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:08:05.387 --> 00:08:13.129]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.178 --> 00:08:23.483]  It's already Wednesday, the 17th day of June 2015.
[00:08:23.483 --> 00:08:27.668]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.668 --> 00:08:38.538]  And the news today is absolutely piercing how it exposes the planetary program to bring an absolute dehumanization.
[00:08:38.538 --> 00:08:42.302]  Just look at these three articles I'm about to cover.
[00:08:43.567 --> 00:09:09.831]  New York State Senator Proposes Using GPS Implants Implants To Track Violent Convicts New York State Senator Proposes Using GPS Implants To Track Violent Convicts That's CBS News Now it dovetails with this article out of the London Independent
[00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:15.352]  Self-driving cars may have to be programmed to kill you.
[00:09:15.352 --> 00:09:22.517]  Auto manufacturers and Google and others are admitting, as soon as I read the headline I knew what it was going to say.
[00:09:22.517 --> 00:09:27.639]  The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one or the few.
[00:09:27.639 --> 00:09:29.560]  That's collectivist thinking.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:36.805]  Self-driving cars may have to be programmed to kill you if it means killing you will save others.
[00:09:37.745 --> 00:09:43.788]  And of course, we know for a long time they've been killing folks with remote control aircraft, remote control automobiles.
[00:09:43.788 --> 00:09:50.031]  All of the new aircraft since about six years ago, all the big commercial ones, have remote control technology in them.
[00:09:50.031 --> 00:09:51.531]  That's in industry publications.
[00:09:51.531 --> 00:09:56.253]  In fact, that's an old story that could be new, because most people don't know about it.
[00:09:56.253 --> 00:10:03.817]  We should pull up those documents to get into a story for the nightly news about, did you know that passenger liners are already remote controlled?
[00:10:03.817 --> 00:10:04.117]  They are.
[00:10:05.266 --> 00:10:09.150]  Bush, one day after 9-11 was in New York, gave a press conference.
[00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:14.235]  He gave one on top of the rubble pile, gave another later at a police headquarters.
[00:10:14.235 --> 00:10:20.542]  And he got up there, and we can't find the video again, but we found the transcript on PBS from a front line.
[00:10:21.772 --> 00:10:26.479]  And he said, well, the great part about it is, is that the planes are remote control.
[00:10:26.479 --> 00:10:29.964]  In fact, these planes were, but we just didn't think about it.
[00:10:29.964 --> 00:10:33.469]  And then they grab him by the arm and tell him to shut up.
[00:10:33.469 --> 00:10:35.312]  Because obviously presidents have real bosses.
[00:10:37.793 --> 00:10:40.014]  And of course the planes were remote controlled.
[00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:41.634]  There was nerve gas released inside.
[00:10:41.634 --> 00:10:47.855]  We don't know the full story, but the only real air phone calls, not the other fake calls the FBI admitted to their credit, were all fake.
[00:10:47.855 --> 00:10:51.116]  There was no calls to the Solicitor General from his wife.
[00:10:51.116 --> 00:10:51.856]  None of that was true.
[00:10:51.856 --> 00:10:53.637]  That came out in CNN even.
[00:10:53.637 --> 00:11:01.139]  But there were two air calls from two aircraft, choking, can't breathe, there's gas, people passing out, help us!
[00:11:01.139 --> 00:11:07.060]  You release nerve gas, or knockout gas, we're not sure which one, you remote control those babies right in.
[00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.030]  Whoever did it.
[00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:12.431]  We just know the official story is a fairy tale.
[00:11:12.431 --> 00:11:13.491]  We've got the calls.
[00:11:13.491 --> 00:11:14.792]  Gas can't breathe.
[00:11:14.792 --> 00:11:17.132]  Help!
[00:11:17.132 --> 00:11:20.033]  Self-driving cars may have to be programmed to kill you.
[00:11:20.033 --> 00:11:22.574]  How loving!
[00:11:22.574 --> 00:11:24.094]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[00:11:24.094 --> 00:11:27.355]  That dovetails with this little goblet of news from the Daily Mail.
[00:11:27.355 --> 00:11:31.056]  Will your car or will your job be stolen by a robot?
[00:11:31.056 --> 00:11:33.516]  Will your job be stolen by a robot?
[00:11:33.516 --> 00:11:35.637]  Calculator reveals the likelihood of a droid
[00:11:37.006 --> 00:11:39.687]  Sitting at your desk in the future.
[00:11:39.687 --> 00:11:47.331]  And again, Australia's robot-led future put squeeze on humans, BBC.
[00:11:47.331 --> 00:11:51.293]  How Google turned Alameda into a mad science laboratory.
[00:11:51.293 --> 00:12:00.097]  The decision has been made to build a world not designed for humans.
[00:12:00.097 --> 00:12:02.038]  By all the technocrats.
[00:12:02.038 --> 00:12:06.500]  16 years ago, Bill Joy said this a thousand times, I'll say it again, or more,
[00:12:09.053 --> 00:12:14.474]  Went to a globalist confab with 200 top tech owners and leaders, a bunch of billionaires.
[00:12:14.474 --> 00:12:19.616]  And they had a meeting about, do we kill everybody because humans aren't needed?
[00:12:19.616 --> 00:12:25.997]  Or do we give them toys and games and TV shows and reality shows to watch and virtual reality?
[00:12:25.997 --> 00:12:28.278]  And the decision was made to exterminate.
[00:12:30.728 --> 00:12:41.375]  The decision was made to exterminate, exterminate, like Doctor Who's little bot robots, the Daleks, that go around killing people.
[00:12:41.375 --> 00:12:46.038]  But these aren't your grandpa's or daddy's Daleks.
[00:12:46.038 --> 00:12:53.903]  And I just sit here warning everyone that Wozniak, the founder of Apple, said the same thing.
[00:12:53.903 --> 00:12:58.546]  The creator of the internet has come out and said the same thing.
[00:12:58.546 --> 00:12:59.667]  I forget his name, he's a British.
[00:13:00.487 --> 00:13:01.869]  British royalty now.
[00:13:01.869 --> 00:13:04.531]  He's been, you know, promoted because of inventing the internet.
[00:13:04.531 --> 00:13:05.352]  It wasn't Al Gore.
[00:13:05.352 --> 00:13:10.157]  I mean, they're just all out there warning everyone.
[00:13:10.157 --> 00:13:13.540]  In fact, they're actually good people.
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.844]  They're telling you the elite have made the decision.
[00:13:16.844 --> 00:13:19.706]  Apple co-founder, Washington Post, on artificial intelligence.
[00:13:19.706 --> 00:13:22.089]  The future is scary and very bad for people.
[00:13:24.485 --> 00:13:34.169]  And you can argue these guys really aren't good, that there's a metaphysical rule that they've got to warn you and tell you what they're doing to you before they do it.
[00:13:34.169 --> 00:13:41.732]  But I've actually talked to a lot of high-level people, and they're completely freaked out.
[00:13:41.732 --> 00:13:43.093]  The owner of Tesla.
[00:13:44.918 --> 00:13:52.066]  I happen to know is a listener and has told people, mutual friends, that he's a listener and he's totally freaked out.
[00:13:52.066 --> 00:13:55.670]  And you see him running around warning everybody as well.
[00:13:55.670 --> 00:14:01.457]  I mean, basically, Stephen Hawking's out there saying the exact same thing because it's a fact.
[00:14:03.237 --> 00:14:08.720]  Humans are supposed to take control of their environment and control it and build a future for humans.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:17.085]  The elite have decided to steal the future from humans, act like they're a new species, break away and merge with machines.
[00:14:17.085 --> 00:14:24.329]  One of the few people not pushing this, warning people, is Ray Kurzweil.
[00:14:24.329 --> 00:14:27.151]  He says, the head of Google technology development, he said,
[00:14:29.704 --> 00:14:32.286]  Doesn't matter if you don't merge with machines.
[00:14:32.286 --> 00:14:34.188]  We'll just step on you like you're a bug.
[00:14:34.188 --> 00:14:35.489]  You won't even count.
[00:14:35.489 --> 00:14:38.191]  You'll be lucky to try to merge with the machines.
[00:14:38.191 --> 00:14:44.617]  There's going to be a race to become the human-AI hybrid, and all of you that don't understand that are left in the dust.
[00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:47.259]  The decision has been made.
[00:14:50.782 --> 00:14:51.943]  I'm going to say that again.
[00:14:51.943 --> 00:15:03.835]  The decision has been made to build a dystopic anti-human system that is so hellish you beg to be euthanized.
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:13.666]  And you'll be told in a ritual, the UN's already developing this, that you're actually being uploaded, your consciousness and your wisdom to the cloud.
[00:15:13.666 --> 00:15:23.132]  You're going to shed your body and loved ones will be able to talk to their mother and their father and their brother and their sister who've already decided to go on.
[00:15:23.132 --> 00:15:29.777]  It'll look and sound just like you in a hologram and people are going to believe it and just basically walk into the bug zapper.
[00:15:31.718 --> 00:15:52.254]  Because the resources are going to be turned off, the economy is going to be gamed and tilted and jilted and stilted to where it's so hellish, by design, you can only live biologically by giving up all of your sovereignty and merging with nanotech, genetic engineering and hypercomputing.
[00:15:53.615 --> 00:16:10.729]  And everything will be organized and run by IBM and Google's Watson computer, named after the progenitor of the Holocaust, Thomas Watson, who advised and ran the entire Hitler operation, basically, from the United States.
[00:16:13.297 --> 00:16:20.861]  And right now it runs the extermination operations against the vets, the don't treat list, off your political actuaries, as a beta test.
[00:16:20.861 --> 00:16:32.447]  And now it's rolling out in the next few years, system-wide, planetary-wide, total control, down to the treatment your dog gets at the vet is now under Watson's control in most areas.
[00:16:32.447 --> 00:16:37.410]  The treatment that your doctor can give you is now under Watson's control.
[00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.571]  You cannot make up the full magnitude.
[00:16:39.571 --> 00:16:41.412]  Jade Helm is a Watson computer
[00:16:42.708 --> 00:16:49.510]  Algorithm codenamed Mastering the Human Domain.
[00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:54.371]  And it's not codenamed anymore.
[00:16:54.371 --> 00:17:04.014]  And those that are smart enough to even physically resist down the road or try to sabotage fiber optic or try to jam systems, then they'll dispatch special forces to kill you.
[00:17:05.288 --> 00:17:10.192]  As the special forces families die of cancer and their children are mentally retarded.
[00:17:10.192 --> 00:17:24.182]  I mean soon, half the public is going to be basically mentally retarded or have serious disabilities and then it's going to be 70-80% and by then, just 15-20 years from now, robots are going to be everywhere.
[00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:30.831]  I mean, you want a hell future, baby?
[00:17:30.831 --> 00:17:33.851]  Implantable microchips, you name it, to buy and sell.
[00:17:33.851 --> 00:17:34.612]  It's all here.
[00:17:34.612 --> 00:17:36.152]  It's all being announced.
[00:17:36.152 --> 00:17:39.173]  It isn't Alex Jones telling you 18 years ago or 20 years ago.
[00:17:39.173 --> 00:17:41.373]  It's CBS News with a straight face.
[00:17:41.373 --> 00:17:44.454]  It's the news announcing worldwide forced inoculations.
[00:17:44.454 --> 00:17:46.775]  It's the churches hailing world government.
[00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:54.737]  It's the Catholic Church, the Pope, calling for planetary government to enforce carbon taxes and carbon credits and carbon regimes.
[00:17:54.737 --> 00:17:56.037]  I mean, it's here.
[00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:08.013]  And if it wasn't for the hand of God, even the elect would be deceived.
[00:18:08.013 --> 00:18:11.735]  DARPA is announcing brain chips to, quote, get rid of bad memories.
[00:18:11.735 --> 00:18:15.877]  They're already, for six years, been implanting them in troops publicly.
[00:18:15.877 --> 00:18:18.019]  We knew about it 15 years ago.
[00:18:18.019 --> 00:18:24.682]  They take troops with PTSD and tell them, we'll give you unlimited private health care and everything if you just accept this.
[00:18:24.682 --> 00:18:26.623]  And then after that, it gets even worse.
[00:18:26.623 --> 00:18:30.145]  They give them viral injections that eat part of their brain.
[00:18:30.145 --> 00:18:31.686]  You name it, it's all here.
[00:18:34.898 --> 00:18:37.500]  You cannot make up where we're already at.
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.503]  It's already far worse than I even know.
[00:18:40.503 --> 00:18:42.604]  It's always worse than I even know.
[00:18:42.604 --> 00:18:43.925]  People think I'm exaggerating.
[00:18:43.925 --> 00:18:44.806]  It's the opposite.
[00:18:44.806 --> 00:18:46.327]  It's far worse.
[00:18:46.327 --> 00:18:47.849]  And I'm not trying to be negative here.
[00:18:47.849 --> 00:18:50.791]  The only way to beat this is to face how far we've fallen.
[00:18:50.791 --> 00:18:52.572]  Oh, I just mentioned three articles.
[00:18:52.572 --> 00:18:56.336]  I've got over 160 articles.
[00:18:56.336 --> 00:18:57.817]  Each one of them more insane than the last.
[00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:04.787]  We told you Europe was designed to implode and then continue the consolidation.
[00:19:04.787 --> 00:19:14.171]  Well now, it's in mainstream news that the next great European financial crisis has begun.
[00:19:14.171 --> 00:19:17.973]  But don't worry, the NSA is not in trouble for illegal spying.
[00:19:17.973 --> 00:19:22.775]  The Cardinals are being investigated for hacking into Astro's database.
[00:19:22.775 --> 00:19:28.718]  That's right, because people only care about sports, so they'll give you a government that goes after scandals in soccer and in baseball.
[00:19:29.907 --> 00:19:34.890]  And in football... What a joke.
[00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:42.814]  Well, meanwhile... 90 plus percent of technocrats say, we're sorry the decision's been made to kill you.
[00:19:42.814 --> 00:19:44.935]  Don't let your children have iPads.
[00:19:44.935 --> 00:19:46.516]  It's there to brain damage them.
[00:19:46.516 --> 00:19:48.557]  I'm Steve Jobs.
[00:19:48.557 --> 00:19:50.598]  And I approve this message.
[00:19:50.598 --> 00:19:52.399]  So they feel okay about what they're doing.

[00:21:47.978 --> 00:21:49.599]  Distributor inquiries welcome.
[00:21:53.939 --> 00:21:55.721]  Honey, it's time for dinner.
[00:21:55.721 --> 00:21:57.583]  What are you doing over there on your computer?
[00:21:57.583 --> 00:21:59.064]  I'm shopping for a new wallet.
[00:21:59.064 --> 00:22:00.626]  Mine is falling apart.
[00:22:00.626 --> 00:22:06.772]  Hey, did you know there's a company called ID Stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing?
[00:22:06.772 --> 00:22:10.015]  Oh, I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing.
[00:22:10.015 --> 00:22:10.536]  What is that?
[00:22:10.836 --> 00:22:20.384]  Well, apparently many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID to transmit our banking information to card readers when we pay.
[00:22:20.384 --> 00:22:29.112]  Unfortunately, a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people, collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing it.
[00:22:29.112 --> 00:22:29.732]  Wow!
[00:22:29.732 --> 00:22:31.053]  That sounds scary.
[00:22:31.053 --> 00:22:35.497]  Since you're getting a new wallet anyway, you should definitely get an ID Stronghold shielded wallet.
[00:22:35.497 --> 00:22:36.318]  Are they more expensive?
[00:22:36.758 --> 00:22:37.258]  No.
[00:22:37.258 --> 00:22:44.943]  In fact, I can get a shielded leather wallet from IDStronghold.com for the same price or less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores.
[00:22:44.943 --> 00:22:46.144]  Sounds great!
[00:22:46.144 --> 00:22:48.765]  My wallet isn't falling apart yet, but let me pick one out too.
[00:22:48.765 --> 00:22:52.848]  I want to be protected, and these wallets at IDStronghold.com look fantastic!
[00:22:53.424 --> 00:22:54.404]  Hey, Berky Guy here.

[00:23:51.268 --> 00:23:52.148]  Come and take it!
[00:24:04.068 --> 00:24:11.040]  AI smart dust, smart meters, the RFID implanted, the cameras, the microphones.
[00:24:14.028 --> 00:24:23.475]  It's all being announced on mainstream news that, oh, your iPhone's gonna watch you, your droid's gonna watch you, and if you're in trouble, it's gonna call the police.
[00:24:23.475 --> 00:24:28.378]  But don't worry, it's just some artificially intelligent tech that knows when there's a problem.
[00:24:28.378 --> 00:24:31.060]  Oh, the new car is coming out.
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:35.743]  They're gonna have sensors of humans in it, and it gets too hot, and it's gonna call the cops.
[00:24:35.743 --> 00:24:39.026]  There won't be any kids overheating and dying in the car anymore.
[00:24:40.675 --> 00:24:42.897]  Oh, the cameras on the highways.
[00:24:42.897 --> 00:24:46.641]  Computers are monitoring those and will flag suspicious activity.
[00:24:46.641 --> 00:24:50.285]  This has already been going on for years, but now it's rolling out.
[00:24:50.285 --> 00:25:02.496]  And then when you're 11-year-olds playing in the backyard at 5 o'clock, the police will come and take them away from you and put them in foster care, saying it's neglect.
[00:25:02.496 --> 00:25:02.737]  You see,
[00:25:04.013 --> 00:25:08.236]  This nanny state is run by the globalist and is evil.
[00:25:08.236 --> 00:25:10.377]  That's why it's so bad.
[00:25:10.377 --> 00:25:23.206]  And we're paying for it and they didn't ask us, they just put the Trojan horse techs, the Trojan horse tech in everything.
[00:25:23.206 --> 00:25:26.569]  And this just hit me again this morning how hardcore this is.
[00:25:30.914 --> 00:25:36.458]  I have trouble even talking, realizing that the elite have made the decision to do this.
[00:25:36.458 --> 00:25:39.380]  In fact, put that back on screen if you can.
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:47.066]  National News last week, 11-year-old boy played in his yard, CPS took him, felony charges for parents.
[00:25:47.066 --> 00:25:51.929]  See, it was worse than my memory had had.
[00:25:51.929 --> 00:25:57.293]  They didn't just take the child, they charged the parents with felonies.
[00:25:57.293 --> 00:25:57.934]  That's in Florida.
[00:26:00.748 --> 00:26:05.170]  And I just go back to that because it illustrates everything we're talking about.
[00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:09.052]  This is a hellhole for everybody.
[00:26:09.052 --> 00:26:23.799]  And ahead of the machine takeover, the chemicals, the biologicals are in the food and water, with powdered eggs and bread and other processed foods having 300 to 700 plus
[00:26:27.898 --> 00:26:34.079]  Parts per million of hydrofluorosilicic acid in powder form.
[00:26:34.079 --> 00:26:36.500]  That's strong enough to kill roaches.
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.460]  I'm going to say that again.
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:45.642]  Hundreds of food items at the grocery store have fluoride in them strong enough to kill roaches.
[00:26:45.642 --> 00:26:47.322]  I'm going to say that again.
[00:26:47.322 --> 00:26:52.884]  Hundreds of food items at the store have fluoride strong enough in it to kill roaches.
[00:26:52.884 --> 00:26:53.764]  I'm going to say that again.
[00:26:55.470 --> 00:27:03.494]  Hundreds of food items at the store have fluoride in them strong enough to poison insects to death.
[00:27:03.494 --> 00:27:05.214]  I'm not trying to scare you.
[00:27:05.214 --> 00:27:12.998]  I'm warning you, we're under total attack!
[00:27:12.998 --> 00:27:22.422]  Before I get into that news, and into the economic news, and into the latest Vatican news, and into the TPP news, and the treason there, let me just give you this article.
[00:27:28.834 --> 00:27:31.296]  This is out of the London Telegraph.
[00:27:31.296 --> 00:27:37.341]  How sexually confusing moths could save your clothes from holes?
[00:27:37.341 --> 00:27:47.288]  See, they tell you changing the sexual persuasion of insects, that's how they kill fire ants and many other things, is a good thing.
[00:27:47.288 --> 00:27:48.269]  And they sell the idea.
[00:27:48.269 --> 00:27:49.510]  Let me explain something.
[00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:54.254]  This is what's been deployed against us in the globalist's own words.
[00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:12.405]  And then as it becomes super common for females to feel like males and males to feel like females because of the chemicals that have been publicly deployed against us, they then advertise it as if it's a cultural change and a right and a wondrous thing.
[00:28:13.326 --> 00:28:31.355]  Just like breast cancer going up 2,000 plus, 3,000 plus percent depending on which western country in the last 50 years is made into a big thing of let's give money when we buy things and when we get a drink or when we go for a jog in a marathon or a 10k and give money to find the cure.
[00:28:31.355 --> 00:28:34.796]  No, let's find why it's exploding.
[00:28:34.796 --> 00:28:36.437]  I've said it hundreds of times.
[00:28:36.437 --> 00:28:40.059]  If people were getting shot in record numbers, you'd find out who was shooting them.
[00:28:40.059 --> 00:28:42.160]  You wouldn't try to find a cure for gunshot wounds.
[00:28:46.018 --> 00:28:47.719]  But see, they make it a process.
[00:28:47.719 --> 00:28:49.119]  Everybody's got autism now!
[00:28:49.119 --> 00:28:50.139]  Be part of the community!
[00:28:50.139 --> 00:28:54.401]  But never find out why it's up from 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 56.
[00:28:54.401 --> 00:28:59.882]  In South Korea, 1 in 25.
[00:28:59.882 --> 00:29:02.643]  They're the record-level vacciners.
[00:29:02.643 --> 00:29:04.844]  Soon it'll be 1 in 10, 1 in 5.
[00:29:04.844 --> 00:29:09.385]  They're saying by 2030, 1 in 3 won't be able to talk.
[00:29:09.385 --> 00:29:11.486]  It'll be part of the community!
[00:29:11.486 --> 00:29:12.806]  No one ask why!
[00:29:12.806 --> 00:29:15.567]  You're not against the autistic children, are you?
[00:29:18.254 --> 00:29:21.678]  Even mentioning that someone did it to them is, oh, you're against them.
[00:29:21.678 --> 00:29:25.762]  Oh, oh, hey, they're putting chemicals in the water to make men be attracted to men.
[00:29:25.762 --> 00:29:26.663]  They do it to insects, too.
[00:29:26.663 --> 00:29:27.444]  Here's the document.
[00:29:27.444 --> 00:29:29.026]  Shut up, you're against gay people.
[00:29:29.026 --> 00:29:32.570]  Uh, no, I'm saying it's being purposely done on record.
[00:29:33.371 --> 00:29:35.132]  We're gonna come back and break it down.
[00:29:35.132 --> 00:29:36.913]  It's chemical warfare.
[00:29:36.913 --> 00:29:39.535]  Does that mean that it hasn't always happened throughout history?
[00:29:39.535 --> 00:29:40.516]  Naturally, yes.
[00:29:40.516 --> 00:29:42.177]  The numbers are way up though.
[00:29:42.177 --> 00:29:43.478]  Artificially being done.
[00:29:43.478 --> 00:29:44.879]  We're on the march.
[00:29:44.879 --> 00:29:46.380]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:47.400]  It's the gay bomb.
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.762]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:49.762 --> 00:29:50.983]  It's a chemical pheromone.
[00:29:54.349 --> 00:30:01.375]  The Pope has written an encyclical calling for a global political authority with power to save the environment.
[00:30:01.375 --> 00:30:07.060]  A Pope once came after Galileo for pointing out that the sun was the center of our solar system.
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:12.265]  Today, those who point out that the sun is the dominant factor in climate are vilified.
[00:30:12.845 --> 00:30:18.288]  The dogma of man-made global warming has been more of a religion than a science for a long time.
[00:30:18.288 --> 00:30:25.391]  James Lovelock, father of the Gaia hypothesis, pointedly said that environmentalism has, quote, become a religion, unquote.
[00:30:25.391 --> 00:30:33.415]  The outgoing head of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said climate change is, quote, my religion and dharma, unquote.
[00:30:33.815 --> 00:30:36.977]  The religion of environmentalism even has its own indulgences.
[00:30:36.977 --> 00:30:41.179]  You can pay for your sins against the environment with carbon credits.
[00:30:41.179 --> 00:30:46.402]  It was the abuse of indulgences by a former Pope that led to the Protestant Reformation.
[00:30:46.402 --> 00:30:51.445]  Today, we need a political and scientific reformation of the Church of Climatology.
[00:30:51.445 --> 00:30:53.326]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:30:53.786 --> 00:30:54.366]  I want more candy!
[00:30:54.366 --> 00:30:55.507]  I want more baby again!
[00:30:55.507 --> 00:30:57.027]  Mine, mine, mine!
[00:30:57.027 --> 00:31:06.771]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:31:06.771 --> 00:31:09.471]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:31:09.471 --> 00:31:13.033]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:31:13.033 --> 00:31:19.355]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[00:31:19.355 --> 00:31:22.696]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on
[00:31:22.936 --> 00:31:23.797]  We're good to go.
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:32:10.356]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[00:32:10.356 --> 00:32:13.859]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[00:32:14.199 --> 00:32:18.260]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:19.801]  hdfirearms.com.
[00:32:19.801 --> 00:32:28.223]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people, they're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[00:32:28.223 --> 00:32:32.164]  It's always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.
[00:32:32.164 --> 00:32:34.545]  Go to their website, hdfirearms.com.

[00:32:38.966 --> 00:32:43.067]  You can pick it up at the gun show, you can pick it up at a local sporting goods store, whatever you do,

[00:32:46.668 --> 00:32:51.350]  The spirit of 1776 lives at Head Down Firearms.
[00:32:51.350 --> 00:33:03.815]  Hdfirearms.com.
[00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:04.956]  I'm up here in space.
[00:33:06.431 --> 00:33:15.435]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:15.435 --> 00:33:16.455]  I'm here in space.
[00:33:16.455 --> 00:33:17.856]  I'm looking out on you.
[00:33:17.856 --> 00:33:18.936]  Looking out on you.
[00:33:18.936 --> 00:33:20.297]  My lasers trace.
[00:33:20.297 --> 00:33:21.877]  My lasers trace.
[00:33:21.877 --> 00:33:22.638]  Everything you do.
[00:33:22.638 --> 00:33:24.178]  Everything you do.
[00:33:24.178 --> 00:33:25.579]  You think you've privatized.
[00:33:25.579 --> 00:33:27.119]  You think you've privatized.
[00:33:27.119 --> 00:33:28.420]  Ain't nothing of the kind.
[00:33:29.974 --> 00:33:31.095]  There is no true escape, I'm watching all the time!
[00:33:31.095 --> 00:33:31.435]  I'm the Lamento!
[00:33:31.435 --> 00:33:31.755]  I'm the Lamento!
[00:33:31.755 --> 00:33:32.215]  I suck at screen!
[00:33:32.215 --> 00:33:32.735]  I am from Pet Show Off!
[00:33:32.735 --> 00:33:33.296]  I am from Pet Show Off!
[00:33:33.296 --> 00:33:34.156]  I keep the country free!
[00:33:34.156 --> 00:33:35.177]  I'm Alexis, the electric spy!
[00:33:35.177 --> 00:33:35.817]  I'm Alexis, the electric spy!
[00:33:35.817 --> 00:33:37.578]  I'm Alexis, the electric spy!
[00:33:37.578 --> 00:33:38.338]  I'm Alexis, the electric spy!
[00:33:38.338 --> 00:33:38.939]  I'm Alexis, the electric spy!
[00:33:38.939 --> 00:33:39.759]  I'm Alexis, the electric spy!
[00:33:39.759 --> 00:33:40.740]  I'm Alexis, the electric spy!
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:41.940]  I'm Alexis, the electric spy!
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:42.721]  I'm Alexis, the electric spy!
[00:33:42.721 --> 00:33:43.381]  I'm Alexis, the electric spy!
[00:33:43.381 --> 00:33:44.121]  I'm Alexis, the electric spy!
[00:33:44.121 --> 00:33:45.362]  I'm Alexis, the electric spy!
[00:33:45.362 --> 00:33:47.283]  I'm Alexis, the electric spy!
[00:33:47.283 --> 00:33:49.124]  I'm Alexis, the electric spy!
[00:33:49.124 --> 00:33:50.385]  I'm Alexis, the electric spy!
[00:33:50.385 --> 00:33:51.025]  I'm Alexis, the electric spy!
[00:33:51.025 --> 00:33:51.605]  I'm Alexis, the electric spy!
[00:33:51.605 --> 00:33:52.246]  I'm Alexis, the electric spy!
[00:33:52.246 --> 00:33:52.986]  I'm Alexis, the electric spy!
[00:33:52.986 --> 00:33:53.666]  I'm Alexis, the electric spy!
[00:33:53.666 --> 00:33:54.587]  I'm Alexis, the electric spy!
[00:33:58.905 --> 00:34:04.107]  Can't Fill My Stare, an incredible lyrics of Halford.
[00:34:04.107 --> 00:34:26.675]  What a brain.
[00:34:26.675 --> 00:34:28.216]  Now the electric eye.
[00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:32.191]  He's watching everybody.
[00:34:32.191 --> 00:34:33.952]  And now it's becoming sentient.
[00:34:33.952 --> 00:34:35.614]  The beast that talks.
[00:34:35.614 --> 00:34:38.736]  The great machine worshipped worldwide that all can see.
[00:34:38.736 --> 00:34:46.583]  The holograms projected into your living rooms that are about to be rolled out in the next few years.
[00:34:46.583 --> 00:34:52.288]  You know, James Cameron got led into all this stuff about 25 years ago by the Globalist.
[00:34:52.288 --> 00:34:56.071]  And he's got these big quasi-secret laboratories in Los Angeles.
[00:34:57.421 --> 00:35:02.684]  Where they're planning the future of TV and movies where you go in and around you.
[00:35:02.684 --> 00:35:06.846]  It's a 360 movie with holograms.
[00:35:06.846 --> 00:35:11.969]  And they're preparing for the massive rollout of these in the near future.
[00:35:11.969 --> 00:35:15.471]  But Cameron got so freaked out by it.
[00:35:15.471 --> 00:35:21.054]  That he basically abandoned a lot of it and left the United States to New Zealand.
[00:35:21.054 --> 00:35:25.737]  And at the time I talked about that.
[00:35:25.737 --> 00:35:27.138]  And then now of course it's been admitted.
[00:35:31.038 --> 00:35:38.062]  You see, the stuff's so horrible that these billionaires are being told about, that they're really freaking out and having serious conscience problems.
[00:35:38.062 --> 00:35:38.703]  I would too.
[00:35:38.703 --> 00:35:47.688]  I mean, I freak out every day knowing about all this, and just sitting here watching it all unfold.
[00:35:47.688 --> 00:35:52.091]  It's pointless for us to fight with each other over race, over where we're from, or
[00:35:53.174 --> 00:35:57.398]  To fight with the police, who are just brainwashed like the rest of the public.
[00:35:57.398 --> 00:36:00.541]  We're all victims of this thing, and I don't want to be a victim.
[00:36:00.541 --> 00:36:02.182]  I want to control our destiny.
[00:36:02.182 --> 00:36:05.005]  I want to build a better world for humans.
[00:36:05.005 --> 00:36:12.692]  Not a world where we're spiked, where we're thrown on the ash heap of history, where the decision has been made that we're obsolete.
[00:36:17.503 --> 00:36:19.444]  Can you guys go online to the Twilight Zone?
[00:36:19.444 --> 00:36:22.165]  I actually own it back there on DVD.
[00:36:22.165 --> 00:36:23.406]  And find the Obsolete Man.
[00:36:23.406 --> 00:36:25.306]  I know it's on YouTube.
[00:36:25.306 --> 00:36:30.169]  That's the opening scene.
[00:36:30.169 --> 00:36:35.051]  Where Serling's talking about... It's a new tyranny, but really it's the old tyranny.
[00:36:35.051 --> 00:36:37.752]  I wanna play a few minutes of that.
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:40.560]  It's so horrible.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.081]  It's so horrible.
[00:36:42.081 --> 00:36:44.201]  And I just sit up here calmly talking about it every day.
[00:36:44.201 --> 00:36:47.342]  I mean, it's just so insane, so premeditated.
[00:36:47.342 --> 00:36:51.322]  And the globalists have all written books how they're doing it to us, and that's what they've told me.
[00:36:51.322 --> 00:36:52.643]  And their millions have told me.
[00:36:52.643 --> 00:36:53.783]  Alex, we write it all down.
[00:36:53.783 --> 00:36:55.103]  The public doesn't care.
[00:36:55.103 --> 00:36:56.143]  See, they deserve it.
[00:36:56.143 --> 00:36:57.423]  Join us.
[00:36:57.423 --> 00:37:04.985]  Join you in poisoning the public so you can sit back and say you're the elite when a bunch of brain-damaged people watch ESPN and
[00:37:06.852 --> 00:37:13.497]  And Bruce Jenner and just buy into all your bull and you just put stuff in our food and water like you do moths?
[00:37:13.497 --> 00:37:16.979]  So we don't ever have families or kids?
[00:37:16.979 --> 00:37:21.082]  And they know we'll evolve towards the way they direct us in their words.
[00:37:21.082 --> 00:37:23.604]  Well, they've got us devolving.
[00:37:23.604 --> 00:37:26.486]  A species that doesn't procreate is done.
[00:37:26.486 --> 00:37:30.229]  How do you take out fruit flies, fire ants,
[00:37:32.122 --> 00:37:34.203]  Moth infestations.
[00:37:34.203 --> 00:37:38.786]  Number one university in the world researching it, Texas A&M.
[00:37:38.786 --> 00:37:41.327]  With their secret bioweapons development center.
[00:37:41.327 --> 00:37:45.810]  Why do you think that place is so important and gets all these top generals running it?
[00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:48.331]  And they've got their public rollouts.
[00:37:48.331 --> 00:37:51.733]  It's all about sterilizing insects.
[00:37:51.733 --> 00:37:53.894]  And these same systems have been deployed against us.
[00:37:53.894 --> 00:37:58.417]  And it's not a joke, people.
[00:38:01.041 --> 00:38:02.602]  It's just the intro to The Obsolete Man.
[00:38:02.602 --> 00:38:06.786]  We actually have it on DVD back there in Dew's office, but they've moved stuff around.
[00:38:06.786 --> 00:38:11.689]  How Sexually Confusing Moths Could Shave Your Clothes From Holes.
[00:38:11.689 --> 00:38:13.491]  See, it's a friendly article introducing it.
[00:38:15.396 --> 00:38:24.103]  Sexually confusing moths might not seem the obvious solution to protecting your cashmere, but it could be the most effective way to prevent insects from destroying clothes.
[00:38:24.103 --> 00:38:27.025]  Moths have become increasingly difficult, just add humans.
[00:38:27.025 --> 00:38:33.731]  Humans have become increasingly difficult to control since a ban on pesticides, Hitler, which were blamed for the decline of bees.
[00:38:33.731 --> 00:38:35.392]  So you don't want an all-out kill.
[00:38:35.392 --> 00:38:37.413]  You don't want a Hitler or commie move.
[00:38:38.254 --> 00:38:40.616]  Fascist or commie move, it's too obvious.
[00:38:40.616 --> 00:38:46.600]  But keepers at the National History Museum in London have come up with the ingenious solution.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.881]  Yeah, they came up with it.
[00:38:47.881 --> 00:38:59.148]  After suffering a four-year moth and human infestation, add the word moth, which is threatening the fur and feathers of some of its most prized exhibits.
[00:38:59.148 --> 00:39:07.874]  Now they're using a system which tricks male moths into thinking that other male moths are actually females in a bid to stop them mating and producing eggs and larvae.
[00:39:08.942 --> 00:39:18.746]  And it does not involve killing any moths, merely confusing males into fruitlessly chasing members of their own sex and overwhelming their senses so they can no longer smell the females.
[00:39:18.746 --> 00:39:30.831]  It's called the pheromone destruction system, and in simplistic terms, it makes male moths attracted to other male moths, said Armando Mendex, quarantine facility manager at the museum, who is heading the project.
[00:39:30.831 --> 00:39:35.153]  They only live for a couple of weeks, and during that time, there's only a small window in which they can reproduce.
[00:39:35.153 --> 00:39:37.934]  Then they just spray a little bit of it out, and it's bye-bye!
[00:39:40.789 --> 00:39:45.391]  They just add it to the plastic linings and it's bye-bye genitalia.
[00:39:45.391 --> 00:39:48.632]  Male genitalia across the board are shrinking in the West.
[00:39:48.632 --> 00:40:02.917]  Doesn't matter what color you are, doesn't matter what genetic background, the sperm counts are down almost 90%, the genitals are shrinking, and in the brain, through the hypothalamus, through the other glands, they're being picked up by the olfactory nerve to program it.
[00:40:04.255 --> 00:40:13.519]  Men are emitting female pheromones, and we're confused, flapping and running into walls and falling down.
[00:40:13.519 --> 00:40:15.499]  And the globalists are sitting back.
[00:40:15.499 --> 00:40:30.185]  And that's why when I cover this, they put their whole White House operation into overdrive with hundreds of articles saying it's crazy, it's insane, he makes it up, don't look, don't go there, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[00:40:34.005 --> 00:40:39.370]  Look, you feel like you want men, you want to wear a dress, you feel like a girl.
[00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:40.792]  Women, you feel like a boy.
[00:40:40.792 --> 00:40:52.203]  Because you hyper-feminize women, they then basically, it gets into complex hormones, but basically, the women are being turned into males, the men are being turned into females.
[00:40:56.553 --> 00:41:03.418]  And again, if you look at what bovine growth hormone breaks down to into women, it makes them more aggressive, taller.
[00:41:03.418 --> 00:41:07.581]  It makes men, on average, more squat and basically brain damaged.
[00:41:08.737 --> 00:41:10.098]  And it's not helping the women either.
[00:41:10.098 --> 00:41:16.642]  I mean, if you like brain tumors and you like breast cancer when you're 20 years old, baby, it's for you.
[00:41:16.642 --> 00:41:17.663]  That's the good part.
[00:41:17.663 --> 00:41:19.725]  It doesn't just confuse your sexuality.
[00:41:19.725 --> 00:41:25.508]  It mutates you and it screws up your entire endocrine system and your hormonal system.
[00:41:25.508 --> 00:41:27.930]  So knock yourselves out.
[00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:29.931]  Don't listen to me.
[00:41:29.931 --> 00:41:37.737]  Don't listen to me when I made films in 1997 saying they were going to start making prisoners take microchips.
[00:41:39.531 --> 00:41:40.271]  How did I know?
[00:41:40.271 --> 00:41:46.992]  Because Big Think Tank said they were going to put out a whole body modification movement.
[00:41:46.992 --> 00:41:51.713]  This is in Think Tank documents we covered at the time it's in the films, the actual documents.
[00:41:51.713 --> 00:42:02.615]  Again, the universities, how they would make us bisexual, then asexual, and just remove sexuality altogether until what's left of us just wears gray uniforms and have shaved heads.
[00:42:02.615 --> 00:42:04.875]  You're like, wait, I've heard of that before.
[00:42:04.875 --> 00:42:05.615]  THX 1138.
[00:42:05.615 --> 00:42:08.136]  Yes, George Lucas throwing it in your face.
[00:42:08.136 --> 00:42:08.436]  Maybe he's
[00:42:09.653 --> 00:42:10.694]  Maybe he's good.
[00:42:10.694 --> 00:42:11.374]  Maybe he's bad.
[00:42:11.374 --> 00:42:12.695]  I don't know.
[00:42:12.695 --> 00:42:13.716]  That's the future.
[00:42:13.716 --> 00:42:16.638]  If you're allowed to live.
[00:42:16.638 --> 00:42:17.739]  What's wrong?
[00:42:17.739 --> 00:42:19.740]  Take some more pills.
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:21.061]  Medicate yourself.
[00:42:21.061 --> 00:42:28.086]  They've got little 3D Buddhas you worship in your little stall.
[00:42:28.086 --> 00:42:30.467]  Where'd my mate go?
[00:42:30.467 --> 00:42:31.908]  Where'd my partner go?
[00:42:31.908 --> 00:42:34.470]  She's been sent for a reclamation.
[00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:35.411]  Calm down.
[00:42:35.411 --> 00:42:36.191]  Calm down.
[00:42:36.191 --> 00:42:36.812]  Need a pill?
[00:42:39.056 --> 00:42:41.877]  I laugh because it tears my heart out.
[00:42:41.877 --> 00:42:46.298]  New York State Senator proposing using GPS implants to track violent convicts.
[00:42:46.298 --> 00:42:47.238]  And it's going to start!
[00:42:47.238 --> 00:42:48.079]  It's going to happen!
[00:42:48.079 --> 00:42:52.920]  And the churches are going to roll over and say, the Christ says take the chip.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:54.281]  It's of the Lord.
[00:42:54.281 --> 00:42:55.621]  Name it and claim it.
[00:42:55.621 --> 00:42:59.622]  You deserve a God that's going to give you what you want.
[00:42:59.622 --> 00:43:05.364]  And when you take that chip, it gives you faith in the Lord and proves you're good.
[00:43:09.616 --> 00:43:12.997]  It's all coming up!
[00:43:12.997 --> 00:43:15.038]  I'm just trying to shake people out of their trance.
[00:43:15.038 --> 00:43:16.499]  Danger, Will Robinson!
[00:43:16.499 --> 00:43:18.240]  Danger!
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:21.241]  We did find the intro from The Obsolete Man.
[00:43:21.241 --> 00:43:22.381]  This says it all.
[00:43:22.381 --> 00:43:27.944]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth, a miserable little creature who has no value.
[00:43:27.944 --> 00:43:28.364]  You know what?
[00:43:28.364 --> 00:43:30.185]  I do have value.
[00:43:30.185 --> 00:43:31.505]  And we're all Wordsworth.
[00:43:31.505 --> 00:43:34.447]  I don't want to see the end of man, the end of humans.
[00:43:34.447 --> 00:43:36.648]  I don't want to see the end of our species.
[00:43:36.648 --> 00:43:37.288]  I want to see us
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:55.894]  Develop and challenge, but everything's about, be safe, don't run, don't jog, don't endanger yourself, don't defend yourself, don't do cartwheels, don't run, don't jog, don't, don't talk, don't, don't, just, just, just calm down while massive military force and robot attack systems are being built.
[00:43:55.894 --> 00:43:57.275]  Just calm yourselves.
[00:43:57.275 --> 00:43:59.377]  Oh, don't put your own power grid in.
[00:43:59.377 --> 00:44:00.698]  We're going to have to shut that down.
[00:44:01.078 --> 00:44:02.819]  Don't have your own chickens in your backyard.
[00:44:02.819 --> 00:44:03.920]  Don't plant stuff.
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:04.700]  Don't, don't, don't.
[00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:05.801]  No, eat the GMO.
[00:44:05.801 --> 00:44:06.941]  Eat the, drink the fluoride.
[00:44:06.941 --> 00:44:07.501]  We love you.
[00:44:07.501 --> 00:44:08.142]  Take the shots.
[00:44:08.142 --> 00:44:09.082]  They're not taking them.
[00:44:09.082 --> 00:44:09.803]  Take them.
[00:44:09.803 --> 00:44:11.404]  We're gonna take good care of you.
[00:44:11.404 --> 00:44:12.784]  Just take the shot.
[00:44:12.784 --> 00:44:15.065]  There, now you're better now.
[00:44:15.065 --> 00:44:17.867]  Yes, the virus goes and attacks the cerebral cortex areas.
[00:44:17.867 --> 00:44:18.988]  Mm-hmm, yeah.
[00:44:18.988 --> 00:44:20.348]  You're feeling better now.
[00:44:20.348 --> 00:44:21.289]  Good.
[00:44:21.289 --> 00:44:25.131]  ESPN's on.
[00:44:25.131 --> 00:44:26.712]  Let's go ahead and go to the obsolete man.
[00:44:26.712 --> 00:44:27.032]  Here it is.
[00:44:36.627 --> 00:44:53.611]  You walk into this room at your own risk.
[00:44:53.611 --> 00:44:55.752]  Because it leads to the future.
[00:44:55.752 --> 00:44:59.213]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[00:44:59.213 --> 00:45:00.233]  This is not a new world.
[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:05.864]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[00:45:05.864 --> 00:45:14.371]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[00:45:14.371 --> 00:45:22.457]  It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[00:45:22.457 --> 00:45:28.162]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[00:45:28.162 --> 00:45:30.404]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[00:45:35.758 --> 00:45:38.479]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth.
[00:45:38.479 --> 00:45:45.202]  In his last 48 hours on Earth, he's a citizen of the state, but will soon have to be eliminated.
[00:45:45.202 --> 00:45:47.663]  Because he is built out of flesh.
[00:45:47.663 --> 00:45:49.964]  And because he has a mind.
[00:45:49.964 --> 00:46:01.550]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth, who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:02.810]  Very, very powerful.
[00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:04.231]  I'm gonna play some more of that coming up later.
[00:46:13.536 --> 00:46:16.738]  I'm just speechless at this point.
[00:46:16.738 --> 00:46:29.945]  We have let the most anti-human, jealous, greedy, hateful people the world could ever imagine, who are on such power trips, they believe they're going to decide the full development of humanity.
[00:46:29.945 --> 00:46:35.908]  And they've decided we're obsolete, and they've decided to break with humanity, because they're going to merge with machines and be God.
[00:46:37.691 --> 00:46:46.560]  A real God would make that decision for themselves, but do everything to protect free will and let others develop as they see fit.
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:49.002]  But you're not doing that.
[00:46:49.002 --> 00:47:01.034]  Any entity that was aspiring to be God, little g, would instantly know that, and know that that is a galactic, dimensional, multi-dimensional rule.
[00:47:05.689 --> 00:47:10.351]  No, what we're dealing with is fallen people.
[00:47:10.351 --> 00:47:17.074]  Fallen minds, fallen hearts, fallen souls that wish to pull everyone down with them.
[00:47:17.074 --> 00:47:20.795]  What are the wages of globalism?
[00:47:20.795 --> 00:47:24.457]  Pure, crystalline death.
[00:47:24.457 --> 00:47:26.438]  Mutation.
[00:47:26.438 --> 00:47:27.258]  Degradation.
[00:47:27.258 --> 00:47:28.458]  Pain.
[00:47:28.458 --> 00:47:30.599]  Disease.
[00:47:30.599 --> 00:47:34.521]  The fruits of this tree are rotten, poisonous, stinking.
[00:47:40.478 --> 00:47:45.784]  And I just cannot believe humanity is going to make the decision to let them seduce us.
[00:47:45.784 --> 00:47:47.406]  I mean, I know it seduces you.
[00:47:47.406 --> 00:47:58.077]  You get in one of these new cars and it's got GPS that tells you where all the wrecks are, all the storms, all the gas stations, where you're being directed by it.
[00:47:58.077 --> 00:48:02.282]  And you never think it's dialed into everything, tracking everything you do, creating a total history.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:05.069]  Then you say, well, what do I have to hide?
[00:48:05.069 --> 00:48:06.130]  I'm a good person.
[00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:07.090]  It's not good.
[00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:08.130]  The system's not good.
[00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:14.812]  It's using it to game you, to end you.
[00:48:14.812 --> 00:48:21.935]  Within 15 years, they say, CNN, that everyone will be merged with machines or will be obsolete.
[00:48:21.935 --> 00:48:26.596]  And then you realize those machines are not meant to empower us and they aren't.
[00:48:26.596 --> 00:48:32.618]  No modern machines from GPS to tablets to computers are empowering us.
[00:48:34.255 --> 00:48:40.859]  In every study they are wrecking us.
[00:48:40.859 --> 00:48:53.345]  Humans used to talk for five minutes before they drove somewhere in a city and discuss the best routes and then listen to talk radio where choppers were in the air to tell you what was going on and it was primitive but it was humans interfacing.
[00:48:53.345 --> 00:48:53.706]  When I was
[00:48:54.966 --> 00:48:56.707]  Ten years old, I wasn't allowed a calculator.
[00:48:56.707 --> 00:48:57.968]  I was better at math than I am now.
[00:48:57.968 --> 00:48:59.268]  I don't even know how to do math now.
[00:48:59.268 --> 00:49:02.230]  I don't know how to spell now, because of spell checkers.
[00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:03.731]  I'm being reduced.
[00:49:03.731 --> 00:49:05.312]  I'm losing my humanity.
[00:49:05.312 --> 00:49:08.993]  Like I'm on a space mission to Mars, I'm losing my muscles.
[00:49:08.993 --> 00:49:10.334]  Well, I'm losing my mental muscles.
[00:49:10.334 --> 00:49:11.275]  I'm rotting.
[00:49:11.275 --> 00:49:12.235]  I'm dying.
[00:49:12.235 --> 00:49:13.256]  I can feel it.
[00:49:13.256 --> 00:49:14.056]  I can see it.
[00:49:14.056 --> 00:49:20.720]  And I can watch the metric meters of my species, our species, our people, under total attack!
[00:49:21.656 --> 00:49:23.377]  By design!
[00:49:23.377 --> 00:49:28.880]  This Pandora's box of technology would have probably destroyed us, even if we tried to be good.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:35.324]  But the globalists have decided to go to the center of evil, the center of destructiveness.
[00:49:35.324 --> 00:49:40.927]  They believe by merging with it, they will control it and will achieve godhood.
[00:49:40.927 --> 00:49:42.308]  Can anybody say megalomania?
[00:49:45.703 --> 00:49:49.566]  Already, AI is beating humans across the board.
[00:49:49.566 --> 00:49:54.050]  For a decade in chess, but in every other test.
[00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:56.252]  And that's the AI they're telling us about.
[00:49:56.252 --> 00:49:59.975]  There's a reason they're on such power trips in government now, in the West.
[00:49:59.975 --> 00:50:03.779]  They've got life extension where you can live to 200 already.
[00:50:03.779 --> 00:50:06.221]  If you can go out another 100 years, they believe forever now.
[00:50:07.398 --> 00:50:11.908]  They've got aircrafts that go Mach 20 in the atmosphere.
[00:50:11.908 --> 00:50:13.371]  They've got space bases.
[00:50:13.371 --> 00:50:14.433]  They've got it all, folks.
[00:50:14.433 --> 00:50:16.538]  Let me just tell you right now.
[00:50:16.538 --> 00:50:17.340]  They've got it all.
[00:50:18.413 --> 00:50:21.776]  And that's why we don't matter anymore because they're just breaking away.
[00:50:21.776 --> 00:50:25.819]  They're hitting us with chemicals, teaching us how to wear dresses, messing with us.
[00:50:25.819 --> 00:50:26.660]  Oh, you want to be black?
[00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:28.241]  Go ahead, you're white, you know.
[00:50:28.241 --> 00:50:43.253]  It's all delusional as they just hit us with culture confusion weapons as they just break off and laugh at us and build giant bunkers with seed vaults and DNA vaults of every plant and animal because they're getting ready to wipe us off the earth playing God.
[00:50:43.253 --> 00:50:44.594]  The devil.
[00:50:44.594 --> 00:50:46.136]  They're about to give the devil
[00:50:47.475 --> 00:50:49.059]  The archetype of the devil.
[00:50:49.059 --> 00:50:52.747]  Manifestation on the planet to kill!

[00:52:25.391 --> 00:52:30.772]  And Mark says to me, hey, third Sunday, June, Father's Day, I ordered Dad a gun.
[00:52:30.772 --> 00:52:31.652]  It's here.
[00:52:31.652 --> 00:52:34.393]  He's going to build it out, and we're going to go out on Father's Day shooting.
[00:52:34.393 --> 00:52:35.013]  You want to come?
[00:52:35.013 --> 00:52:35.933]  And I said, yeah.
[00:52:35.933 --> 00:52:40.774]  What a great idea for a Father's Day gift, an AR-15 rifle kit from Guns80.com.
[00:52:40.774 --> 00:52:41.814]  I think I'll get my dad one.
[00:52:41.814 --> 00:52:42.774]  He says, go ahead.
[00:52:42.774 --> 00:52:43.535]  See you out on the range.
[00:52:43.535 --> 00:52:45.435]  So we're going to meet on the range on Father's Day.

[00:54:08.968 --> 00:54:19.310]  I am an eternal optimist, but the globalists have told us that they're directing the technological development of our planet towards destruction.
[00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:32.854]  And if you study history, any decadent society begins to obsess on evil, on death, on destruction, and through the collective unconsciousness, basically manifests that.
[00:54:32.854 --> 00:54:37.635]  But we need to recognize the tyranny of the AI, the tyranny of the smart grid,
[00:54:39.087 --> 00:54:41.188]  When you hear smart, think slave.
[00:54:41.188 --> 00:54:43.350]  When you hear smart, think big brother.
[00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:54.037]  And just as we've been defeating the GMO lobby, and the gun grabbing lobby, and the fluoride lobby, we're going to defeat the AI.
[00:54:54.037 --> 00:55:01.642]  As the attacks on humanity become more and more clear, folks are going to join us, and that's beginning to happen.
[00:55:01.642 --> 00:55:05.825]  Reddit claims that an AI computer created this monstrosity of artwork.
[00:55:06.823 --> 00:55:07.984]  Who knows if it's true or not?
[00:55:07.984 --> 00:55:12.606]  If you're a TV viewer, we'll put it on screen.
[00:55:12.606 --> 00:55:25.874]  And I don't believe computers are bad in and of themselves, but if we don't educate the public properly about the way things are being engineered, we don't have a hope.
[00:55:25.874 --> 00:55:27.875]  Now, I haven't even gotten into Maynard.
[00:55:27.875 --> 00:55:35.360]  Maynard's always saying, don't try to throw me out of the leadership, be nice Tea Party, while he organizes with the Democrats to raise money to defeat the Tea Party.
[00:55:36.792 --> 00:55:44.257]  Three of the House members that voted to kill TPP that were in leadership have all been kicked out of leadership.
[00:55:44.257 --> 00:55:52.002]  It shouldn't be that the leaders of the House and Senate get to pick who the leaders are under them who basically get to control legislation.
[00:55:52.002 --> 00:55:53.863]  It's another form of royalty.
[00:55:53.863 --> 00:55:56.384]  And the committee system is only a hundred and something years old.
[00:55:56.384 --> 00:55:59.346]  It's a fraud.
[00:55:59.346 --> 00:56:02.668]  It needs to be removed.
[00:56:02.668 --> 00:56:03.389]  It's disgusting.
[00:56:05.558 --> 00:56:07.900]  Boehner takes his retribution.
[00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:09.381]  What a traitor!
[00:56:09.381 --> 00:56:23.550]  They vote to not hand over secretly our sovereignty to foreign corporations, and a few Republican leaders do the right thing and lead Republicans to say no, when all the big money's against it, and now they're trying to basically kick them out of leadership.
[00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:31.176]  The people that voted against TPP are the kind of folks we need to be governors and presidents.
[00:56:31.176 --> 00:56:34.498]  They're the type of folks you need to defend when the FBI indicts them.
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:37.661]  And just say, I don't care what you make up about them.
[00:56:37.661 --> 00:56:39.022]  They did the right thing for America.
[00:56:39.022 --> 00:56:41.604]  We don't buy it.
[00:56:41.604 --> 00:56:42.844]  We gotta hang together, folks.
[00:56:42.844 --> 00:56:46.667]  We're gonna lose everything.
[00:56:46.667 --> 00:56:55.972]  It's a no-brainer not to do what the globalists asked them to do.
[00:56:55.972 --> 00:57:01.075]  I've got dozens, 45 public statements of Hillary Clinton endorsing TPP.
[00:57:02.478 --> 00:57:08.244]  She's now saying she doesn't know if she likes it, to fool her moron constituents, who I guess aren't morons.
[00:57:08.244 --> 00:57:13.208]  They're smart enough that the biggest group not voting for TPP were Democrats.
[00:57:13.208 --> 00:57:14.429]  So see, that's what makes me mad.
[00:57:14.429 --> 00:57:18.313]  Democrats are smart in some areas, and then so stupid in others.
[00:57:18.313 --> 00:57:22.617]  Like, taking my guns is going to make you safer, idiot.
[00:57:22.617 --> 00:57:24.819]  What's your problem?
[00:57:24.819 --> 00:57:26.281]  And what's the Republicans' problem?
[00:57:29.821 --> 00:57:32.784]  Like, Democrats are the ones that don't like forced inoculations!
[00:57:32.784 --> 00:57:34.366]  What's the Republicans' problem?
[00:57:34.366 --> 00:57:35.507]  Law and order?
[00:57:35.507 --> 00:57:40.352]  Have corporations lobby government to make us take shots at the inserts they can kill us?
[00:57:40.352 --> 00:57:41.113]  By the way, briefly...
[00:57:42.301 --> 00:57:46.102]  Liver Shield, our latest product from Infowarslife.com is out.
[00:57:46.102 --> 00:57:47.062]  It's not a sales gimmick.
[00:57:47.062 --> 00:57:49.223]  It's selling better than I ever thought it would.
[00:57:49.223 --> 00:57:50.603]  We've already sold out of a third of it.
[00:57:50.603 --> 00:57:52.563]  We should have it for about a week, and then more should be in.
[00:57:52.563 --> 00:57:53.844]  It's easy to manufacture.
[00:57:53.844 --> 00:58:03.166]  We've got plenty of the herbs on hand, but you take it for a week with the oxy powder and then do the liver cleanse that's on Infowarslife.com with the olive oil.
[00:58:03.166 --> 00:58:04.506]  Lay on your side for an hour at night.
[00:58:05.166 --> 00:58:10.490]  Most people have spectacular results flushing a bunch of gallstones, and it's spectacular.
[00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:13.172]  It's not painful for most people, but consult your physician.
[00:58:13.172 --> 00:58:15.994]  It's one of the most incredible results I've ever seen.
[00:58:15.994 --> 00:58:18.175]  In fact, not one of the most incredible results.
[00:58:18.175 --> 00:58:21.538]  It's the most incredible health results I've ever seen in my life.
[00:58:21.538 --> 00:58:23.119]  Infowarslife.com
[00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:25.601]  Or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:25.601 --> 00:58:30.407]  We've got a special on it and the oxy powder that goes with it.
[00:58:30.407 --> 00:58:31.909]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:31.909 --> 00:58:34.271]  Second hour as we warn humanity coming up.
[00:58:34.271 --> 00:58:35.072]  We are an emergency beacon.
[00:58:35.072 --> 00:58:35.833]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:35.833 --> 00:58:37.956]  We're an emergency transmission.
[00:58:37.956 --> 00:58:40.118]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:44.213 --> 00:58:50.339]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[00:58:50.339 --> 00:58:54.923]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[00:58:54.923 --> 00:59:02.630]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:08.395]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:59:08.395 --> 00:59:14.341]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[00:59:14.341 --> 00:59:19.306]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[00:59:19.306 --> 00:59:22.889]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:59:23.029 --> 00:59:24.269]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:04.962]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:04.962 --> 01:00:06.542]  You want answers?
[01:00:06.542 --> 01:00:08.083]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:08.083 --> 01:00:12.284]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:12.284 --> 01:00:16.326]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.478 --> 01:00:33.060]  We are back live, broadcasting worldwide.
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:37.984]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:00:37.984 --> 01:00:41.607]  Well, Boehner has taken his retribution, The Hill reports.
[01:00:41.607 --> 01:00:57.460]  House GOP leaders booted three members off the whip team for voting against a procedural rule that structured how a critical trade package was brought to the House floor last week.
[01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:59.521]  That shows the type of garbage that's going on.
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:09.907]  Hillary knows her party is partially sane and is against the TPP.
[01:01:09.907 --> 01:01:17.653]  And so we have an article on Infowars.com that Michael Krieger put together with 45 public statements with Hillary saying we must adopt the TPP.
[01:01:17.653 --> 01:01:19.555]  You can read those at Infowars.com.
[01:01:22.810 --> 01:01:29.894]  Coming up, town threatens mom $1,000 per day fine if she keeps goats needed to feed her babies.
[01:01:29.894 --> 01:01:34.057]  Little miniature goats.
[01:01:34.057 --> 01:01:37.259]  She's going to be joining us coming up because that story's been on a month or so.
[01:01:37.259 --> 01:01:48.425]  It ties into this other report where a veteran has an off-the-grid system.
[01:01:48.425 --> 01:01:50.226]  In fact, I had the article and I can't find it.
[01:01:50.226 --> 01:01:50.947]  Will you guys print it again?
[01:01:51.957 --> 01:01:58.905]  And the government came to him and said, you have to tie it into our grid or we're going to start fining you.
[01:01:58.905 --> 01:02:00.087]  This is all over the country.
[01:02:00.087 --> 01:02:10.159]  The system doesn't want people to have their own power systems.
[01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:11.040]  The system
[01:02:15.501 --> 01:02:19.184]  wants to force you into their controlled paradigm.
[01:02:19.184 --> 01:02:20.745]  It's all about being dependent.
[01:02:20.745 --> 01:02:24.708]  Military veteran taken to court by city over off-grid lifestyle.
[01:02:24.708 --> 01:02:28.251]  Authorities demand man's property be connected to city utilities.
[01:02:28.251 --> 01:02:30.673]  Infowars.com.
[01:02:30.673 --> 01:02:32.494]  And it was on WAFF.
[01:02:32.494 --> 01:02:41.321]  We're going to play part of that newscast when we come back in the next segment and tie it in to the GOAT situation.
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:44.541]  But this is how they operate.
[01:02:44.541 --> 01:02:45.942]  This is what it's all about.
[01:02:45.942 --> 01:02:52.608]  And then the really big news will be at the bottom of the hour.
[01:02:52.608 --> 01:02:57.873]  The next great European financial crisis has begun.
[01:02:57.873 --> 01:03:00.815]  And it's chilling.
[01:03:00.815 --> 01:03:04.819]  UK draws up contingency plans as Bank of Greece warns of uncontrollable crisis.
[01:03:06.229 --> 01:03:07.670]  It's going to be bad, whatever happens.
[01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:10.172]  Greece on the edge of Eurozone exit looms.
[01:03:10.172 --> 01:03:12.353]  That'll send shockwaves throughout the system.
[01:03:12.353 --> 01:03:17.077]  NatWest and RBS customers are panicking after thousands of payments went missing overnight.
[01:03:17.077 --> 01:03:23.801]  We're going to break that down.
[01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:28.745]  We're going to get into every angle of that.
[01:03:28.745 --> 01:03:31.747]  Because that will connect into markets here, obviously.
[01:03:31.747 --> 01:03:32.728]  And notice they've had three
[01:03:34.915 --> 01:03:39.817]  Bailouts for the mega banks that they spend are bailouts of the Greek people.
[01:03:39.817 --> 01:03:40.918]  Most of it's not even their debt.
[01:03:40.918 --> 01:03:46.761]  They were signed on just like Iceland and just like Ireland and just like every other country.
[01:03:46.761 --> 01:03:49.742]  90, 91, 92, 93 is the metric.
[01:03:49.742 --> 01:03:54.705]  Always 90% or more of the debt that comes out is not the country's.
[01:03:54.705 --> 01:03:59.347]  You're signed on like we were to the derivatives and to the banks.
[01:03:59.347 --> 01:04:00.327]  The bailout.
[01:04:00.327 --> 01:04:02.889]  Then they flip it around and say, oh, you're in debt to us.
[01:04:04.116 --> 01:04:09.161]  We give them the money to bail them out, and it isn't like they then just write it off.
[01:04:09.161 --> 01:04:10.442]  No, no, no, no.
[01:04:10.442 --> 01:04:14.946]  We're now in debt to them because the average person doesn't understand finances or how this works.
[01:04:14.946 --> 01:04:17.709]  They get away with it.
[01:04:17.709 --> 01:04:20.071]  And the Greeks are starving in many areas.
[01:04:20.071 --> 01:04:22.493]  It's third world now.
[01:04:22.493 --> 01:04:27.458]  Smart people, great farmland, great tourism.
[01:04:27.458 --> 01:04:28.358]  It's just falling apart.
[01:04:29.264 --> 01:04:31.645]  That's in the news today, Greeks starving.
[01:04:31.645 --> 01:04:34.366]  And it's just gonna get worse, and worse, and worse.
[01:04:34.366 --> 01:04:37.388]  Just like Argentina.
[01:04:37.388 --> 01:04:39.249]  Alright, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:04:39.249 --> 01:04:43.711]  We'll be back with the Goat Bandit.
[01:04:43.711 --> 01:04:45.932]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:45.932 --> 01:04:46.392]  G.G.
[01:04:46.392 --> 01:04:49.053]  Freeman's gonna be joining us.
[01:04:49.053 --> 01:04:52.115]  Actually, in about 20 minutes, I got more news to cover when we come back.
[01:04:52.115 --> 01:04:52.495]  Stay with us.
[01:04:55.342 --> 01:04:56.123]  Fast-tracked?
[01:04:56.123 --> 01:04:57.205]  It's not done.
[01:04:57.205 --> 01:05:05.500]  Outright lies about job creation are now giving way to discussions on how to pay for temporary unemployment benefits for those whose jobs will be exported.
[01:05:06.192 --> 01:05:08.453]  At first they were going to take the money out of Medicare.
[01:05:08.453 --> 01:05:16.015]  Now it looks like they will try to raise fines on small business to pay workers that multinational corporations will fire.
[01:05:16.015 --> 01:05:17.616]  It's not Obama trade.
[01:05:17.616 --> 01:05:19.476]  It's Monsanto trade.
[01:05:19.476 --> 01:05:20.617]  Merck trade.
[01:05:20.617 --> 01:05:22.657]  Goldman Sachs trade.
[01:05:22.657 --> 01:05:24.058]  It's not free trade.
[01:05:24.058 --> 01:05:31.760]  It's traders in Congress trying to pass a secret treaty by subterfuge and subverting the constitutional process for treaty ratification.
[01:05:32.412 --> 01:05:43.218]  The rich get richer as multinational corporations consolidate their ownership of everything, especially their ownership of the leaders of both parties.
[01:05:43.218 --> 01:05:44.419]  Educate your friends.
[01:05:44.419 --> 01:05:45.820]  Educate your families.
[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:47.801]  Stop this before it's too late.

[01:05:50.943 --> 01:05:51.503]  I'm David Knight.

[01:05:58.738 --> 01:06:04.860]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.

[01:06:09.641 --> 01:06:13.203]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[01:06:23.386 --> 01:06:26.908]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:06:26.908 --> 01:06:35.133]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:06:35.133 --> 01:06:40.576]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:06:53.484 --> 01:06:54.745]  Another major health threat.
[01:06:54.745 --> 01:06:59.707]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:06:59.707 --> 01:07:02.388]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:07:02.388 --> 01:07:09.431]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:07:09.431 --> 01:07:12.432]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:07:12.432 --> 01:07:15.374]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:07:15.374 --> 01:07:17.395]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:07:17.395 --> 01:07:20.216]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:07:20.316 --> 01:07:26.063]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:07:26.063 --> 01:07:29.567]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:07:29.567 --> 01:07:32.671]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:07:32.671 --> 01:07:39.760]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:43.186]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[01:07:54.411 --> 01:07:57.353]  This plan, kill the country, world government, it's here!
[01:07:57.353 --> 01:08:02.557]  The challenge is how to build a world order.
[01:08:02.557 --> 01:08:10.202]  Never before has a new world order had to be assembled from so many different perceptions, or on so global a scale.
[01:08:10.202 --> 01:08:14.765]  The governments don't rule the world, Goldman Sachs rules the world.
[01:08:14.765 --> 01:08:20.569]  This is, we are going to carve up the world according to the way we want to.
[01:08:21.209 --> 01:08:21.809]  If you have so much power,
[01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:38.331]  In play.
[01:08:38.331 --> 01:08:39.712]  You can do anything.
[01:08:39.712 --> 01:08:42.814]  Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage.
[01:08:42.814 --> 01:08:46.076]  And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever.
[01:08:46.076 --> 01:08:46.656]  You understand?
[01:08:46.656 --> 01:08:48.297]  You're living in a science fiction movie.
[01:08:48.297 --> 01:08:49.038]  I'm living in it.
[01:08:49.038 --> 01:08:53.421]  The government has just approved the use of a computer chip that would be implanted under your skin.
[01:08:53.421 --> 01:08:57.903]  When complete, everyone will have a unique 12-digit identity number.
[01:08:57.903 --> 01:09:00.765]  That DNA is stored even without your consent.
[01:09:00.765 --> 01:09:03.287]  But I mean, do they point blank say, we're putting a chip in you?
[01:09:05.092 --> 01:09:06.373]  Uh, yeah.
[01:09:06.373 --> 01:09:08.715]  It was an interior barcode, if you will.
[01:09:08.715 --> 01:09:10.015]  This makes my head explode.
[01:09:10.015 --> 01:09:14.879]  That your television could be eavesdropping on your conversations and then sharing it over the web?
[01:09:14.879 --> 01:09:19.302]  All the cars now have tracker boxes that can remote control your vehicle in them.
[01:09:19.302 --> 01:09:25.766]  The Justice Department is building a national database to track in real time the movement of vehicles around the U.S.
[01:09:25.766 --> 01:09:29.248]  storing hundreds of millions of records about motorists.
[01:09:29.248 --> 01:09:31.650]  It's like seeing a leader of space aliens or something with a master plan.
[01:09:31.650 --> 01:09:32.671]  It's so evil.
[01:09:32.671 --> 01:09:33.531]  It's so sadistic.
[01:09:33.531 --> 01:09:34.272]  No, it's the devil.
[01:09:35.132 --> 01:09:38.196]  I mean, that's it.
[01:09:38.196 --> 01:09:42.340]  This galactic force of destruction that's animating people to do this.
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:43.482]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:09:43.482 --> 01:09:45.324]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:09:54.471 --> 01:09:59.714]  Tyler Truitt didn't think his decision to live off the grid would impact anyone else.
[01:09:59.714 --> 01:10:05.017]  What is it of their business what kind of home that we choose to live in?
[01:10:05.017 --> 01:10:11.560]  He uses solar panels for heat and electricity, rainwater for drinking and bathing, and composting for sewage.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:13.041]  Who are we bothering?
[01:10:13.041 --> 01:10:15.263]  That's my biggest question, you know, is why?
[01:10:15.263 --> 01:10:16.324]  Who are we hurting?
[01:10:16.324 --> 01:10:21.989]  Huntsville city leaders say Truett is bothering them and needs to follow city ordinances or leave.
[01:10:21.989 --> 01:10:25.872]  Apparently he has chosen to live an alternate lifestyle and that's great.
[01:10:25.872 --> 01:10:33.059]  You know, people can choose to live different ways, but if you choose to live within the city limits of Huntsville, you do have to abide by our laws and ordinances.
[01:10:33.573 --> 01:10:38.918]  Laws and ordinances that say you cannot live in a trailer that's not in a designated trailer park.
[01:10:38.918 --> 01:10:40.660]  This is there for property protection.
[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:47.186]  Adjoining property owners like protection and some owners might consider a trailer a nuisance.
[01:10:47.186 --> 01:10:49.829]  Truett argues his house is not visible from the road.
[01:10:50.009 --> 01:10:54.211]  I mean, as you can see out here, we're basically out of sight, out of mind.
[01:10:54.211 --> 01:10:57.513]  Another ordinance says you can't live in an unsafe environment.
[01:10:57.513 --> 01:11:03.596]  It's about the health and public safety of our citizens, so you must have sanitary sewer.
[01:11:03.596 --> 01:11:06.497]  You must have certain potable running water.
[01:11:06.497 --> 01:11:10.599]  There are certain requirements that are there to protect our citizens through the winter.
[01:11:11.018 --> 01:11:16.464]  Truett has already made it through one winter living off the grid and says the sun is all he needs.
[01:11:16.464 --> 01:11:17.965]  I think we live pretty comfortable.
[01:11:17.965 --> 01:11:20.829]  I mean, we've got things in our house that normal people would have.
[01:11:20.829 --> 01:11:24.973]  We've got a TV, we've got a refrigerator, microwave, stuff like that.
[01:11:24.973 --> 01:11:27.616]  Truett is hopeful he can work this out with the city.
[01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:33.002]  I have every belief that we will be able to resolve this in our favor.
[01:11:33.499 --> 01:11:37.181]  I asked city officials if it was illegal to live off the grid here.
[01:11:37.181 --> 01:11:44.025]  At 515, I received an email that says it's not, but everyone must follow code if they live within city limits.
[01:11:44.025 --> 01:11:48.327]  If Truett doesn't want to follow that code, city leaders say he can leave.
[01:11:48.327 --> 01:11:54.111]  I'm sure that there are other properties and areas within the country that if you wanted to choose a different lifestyle, you could do so.
[01:11:56.587 --> 01:12:13.742]  But not for long under global treaties that are unratified since 1992, Agenda 21 in Rio de Janeiro, signed on to by George Herbert Walker Bush, never ratified by the Senate.
[01:12:13.742 --> 01:12:15.483]  But still we live under it.
[01:12:15.483 --> 01:12:22.149]  And the element that's lost for radio listeners who couldn't see the video is that
[01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:28.232]  We're talking about somebody out in the middle of the countryside.
[01:12:28.232 --> 01:12:39.588]  And we've got all these tiny towns that might have one restaurant, one gas station, and then five miles away, there's a trailer in the middle of the woods in the countryside.
[01:12:41.089 --> 01:12:57.961]  And the guy wants to use an outhouse, like all our ancestors did, and he wants to live off the grid, and they're saying, no, you're going to live in a 250 square foot, that's the model, coffin apartment, and you're going to pay $8,000 a month for it.
[01:12:57.961 --> 01:13:00.142]  That's the Bloomberg model.
[01:13:00.142 --> 01:13:03.525]  And cities are going to subsidize it and only allow those to be built.
[01:13:03.525 --> 01:13:07.888]  That's now happening in San Francisco, Austin, New York, Chicago, Dallas, you name it.
[01:13:09.815 --> 01:13:20.042]  Not so you get something small and save money, but so that you have to pay more for something small.
[01:13:20.042 --> 01:13:23.324]  This is the negative growth economy.
[01:13:23.324 --> 01:13:37.194]  This is the austerity model with this arrogant code enforcer on a power trip and the good neighbor that complained, of course, when they can't even see his property
[01:13:38.595 --> 01:13:41.997]  Looks like 700 yards or something off the road.
[01:13:41.997 --> 01:13:47.001]  Back in the woods.
[01:13:47.001 --> 01:14:01.131]  This is how they control everybody, and then they're gonna increase the taxes, the regulations, the globalist operations, to ship our jobs overseas, to have such regulations you can't operate here, to where you cannot live without going on welfare.
[01:14:01.131 --> 01:14:01.552]  Walmart!
[01:14:03.168 --> 01:14:12.436]  That has 70 plus million dollars they're reporting today, just offshore in bank accounts, tax-free.
[01:14:12.436 --> 01:14:24.165]  Walmart, for three years, has been telling their employees, oh, we pay you such a little amount, so you qualify for welfare and food stamps as a supplement.
[01:14:24.165 --> 01:14:31.731]  See, and so they're then supported and get a payoff.
[01:14:32.591 --> 01:14:35.912]  Corporate welfare from the U.S.
[01:14:35.912 --> 01:14:38.613]  taxpayer.
[01:14:38.613 --> 01:14:43.494]  USA Today reports $76 billion offshore in tax havens.
[01:14:43.494 --> 01:14:46.475]  And listen, Walmart's not free market.
[01:14:46.475 --> 01:14:48.575]  Walmart games economies.
[01:14:48.575 --> 01:14:50.216]  Walmart buys slave deals.
[01:14:50.216 --> 01:14:51.116]  Walmart lobbied.
[01:14:52.386 --> 01:14:57.729]  For all these so-called free trade deals that are really tariffs on us so we can't compete.
[01:14:57.729 --> 01:15:10.497]  They go to China and other countries have special deals to get things cheaper than anybody else can because they basically pay off the top generals from the PLA that are on these boards.
[01:15:10.497 --> 01:15:16.220]  Walmart, you know, does things like change the law so they can inject meat with water.
[01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:19.142]  So it looks like it weighs more to charge you more.
[01:15:19.142 --> 01:15:20.983]  Wonder why Walmart's steak or chicken shrinks.
[01:15:23.815 --> 01:15:25.516]  Or they get the law changed.
[01:15:25.516 --> 01:15:29.760]  Was it 20 something years ago where they could go out?
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:32.622]  And before it was called racketeering.
[01:15:32.622 --> 01:15:45.813]  And they'll tell 10, 15 egg producers in a region, we're going to sign a contract from you for the next five years to buy your eggs at this amount.
[01:15:45.813 --> 01:15:49.876]  But at any time we want, we can get out of that contract.
[01:15:49.876 --> 01:15:50.597]  We're like, well, you know what?
[01:15:50.597 --> 01:15:51.597]  We just want to do it.
[01:15:51.597 --> 01:15:52.078]  It's great.
[01:15:53.166 --> 01:16:04.871]  And then they go to a whole bunch of producers, so there's a glut, and it produces so many eggs, they then come to them and say, you know what, we've decided you're the biggest manufacturer and the best.
[01:16:04.871 --> 01:16:19.017]  You're going to now do that, and our accountants say you can do it at this cost, where you make no money, but you don't violate the contract, and we're going to basically keep you at it.
[01:16:19.017 --> 01:16:20.398]  That's how Walmart operated.
[01:16:23.001 --> 01:16:26.123]  And then they get the cheapest eggs anybody's got.
[01:16:26.123 --> 01:16:47.135]  But once all the other egg producers are out of business, and once all the other businesses are out of business, and once the convenience store down the street is selling the same eggs Walmart's selling, and doesn't have a choice, and so they can't undercut Walmart, Walmart starts jacking up the prices.
[01:16:47.135 --> 01:16:47.556]  And guess what?
[01:16:47.556 --> 01:16:50.097]  The convenience store is happy because there's no competition anyways.
[01:16:50.097 --> 01:16:51.338]  They jack them up with Walmart.
[01:16:53.174 --> 01:16:57.815]  And then Walmart comes in through another subsidiary and buys out the gas station.
[01:16:57.815 --> 01:17:04.638]  And then the real rapin' starts.
[01:17:04.638 --> 01:17:11.960]  You see, Henry Ford had his problems, but he was a very smart man, and he wanted to build an economy that could buy his products.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:15.361]  He wanted to industrialize North America.
[01:17:15.361 --> 01:17:21.983]  So he would sell Model Ts, where he made a nice profit, but where they were so affordable, his employees could buy one.
[01:17:23.038 --> 01:17:25.980]  And then buy all the accessories and everything else.
[01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:29.122]  And then they got to enjoy the open roads.
[01:17:29.122 --> 01:17:30.983]  They got to get to work faster.
[01:17:30.983 --> 01:17:37.587]  They got to... But he got a large part of their discretionary income forever.
[01:17:37.587 --> 01:17:40.669]  And they were loyal to him because he gave them employee discounts.
[01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:42.170]  That's a smart businessman.
[01:17:42.170 --> 01:17:44.291]  A win-win.
[01:17:44.291 --> 01:17:46.893]  Did it make him the richest industrialist at the time?
[01:17:46.893 --> 01:17:47.673]  Absolutely.
[01:17:47.673 --> 01:17:51.836]  But see, that's a win-win model where you give people a good deal, you take over.
[01:17:54.565 --> 01:17:56.046]  Well, the globalists don't want to give you a good deal.
[01:17:56.046 --> 01:17:57.567]  They want to hurt you.
[01:17:57.567 --> 01:17:59.728]  They want to shut down your farms and ranches.
[01:17:59.728 --> 01:18:01.690]  They want to shut down your five and dimes.
[01:18:01.690 --> 01:18:03.491]  They want to shut down your mom and pops.
[01:18:03.491 --> 01:18:07.133]  They want to shut down your downtown.
[01:18:07.133 --> 01:18:19.842]  And they want the doctor, and the optometrist, and the barber, and the GMO McDonald's, and the diabetes medication, and everything in one shop, one house, one place.
[01:18:23.570 --> 01:18:34.052]  And just in case you try to go out and live in the sticks, and raise your own goats, and raise your own cows, or have an outhouse or a chemical toilet, and you're going to beat the system doing that?
[01:18:34.052 --> 01:18:38.573]  Putting solar panels out there, and you're going to have air conditioning, and you're going to have everything for free?
[01:18:38.573 --> 01:18:41.854]  After you buy those solar panels one time?
[01:18:41.854 --> 01:18:45.855]  You're going to grow grapes, you're going to grow tomatoes, and you're going to sell them to your neighbors?
[01:18:45.855 --> 01:18:46.475]  Guess what?
[01:18:46.475 --> 01:18:47.835]  We're going to send the tax police out.
[01:18:47.835 --> 01:18:50.796]  We're going to spend a million dollars having the feds do a sting on you.
[01:18:52.102 --> 01:18:56.927]  Selling your neighbors those potatoes.
[01:18:56.927 --> 01:19:00.752]  Doesn't matter if you just made a thousand dollars selling those over a whole year to your neighbors.
[01:19:00.752 --> 01:19:03.575]  We're going to shut you down!
[01:19:03.575 --> 01:19:06.859]  We're not going to shut banks down shipping heroin and cocaine in.
[01:19:06.859 --> 01:19:12.305]  We're not going to stop big banks and globalist organizations shipping little kids out to be put in snuff films.
[01:19:13.723 --> 01:19:16.244]  Begging for mommy while they get raped and tortured.
[01:19:16.244 --> 01:19:17.184]  No!
[01:19:17.184 --> 01:19:19.624]  We're gonna shut you down.
[01:19:19.624 --> 01:19:24.866]  And if we catch you using medical marijuana in Kansas, we're gonna give you 30 years in prison.
[01:19:24.866 --> 01:19:27.746]  And we're gonna take your kids from you, lady.
[01:19:27.746 --> 01:19:30.047]  We gave you Crohn's disease with the vaccines.
[01:19:30.047 --> 01:19:31.747]  Now we're gonna put you in a prison.
[01:19:31.747 --> 01:19:32.968]  And you're gonna like it.
[01:19:32.968 --> 01:19:34.268]  And you better like it.
[01:19:37.702 --> 01:19:42.490]  People say, but Walmart's eating itself, you know, in the future it'll have no customers, so everything will collapse.
[01:19:42.490 --> 01:19:43.993]  That's the game plan.
[01:19:43.993 --> 01:19:50.524]  Deindustrialize us, dumb us down, drug us up first, before they release the bioweapons and wipe everybody out.
[01:19:50.524 --> 01:19:51.245]  We'll be back.
[01:19:54.344 --> 01:19:58.827]  More and more people are discovering the incredible benefits of alkalizing the body.

[01:20:31.543 --> 01:20:32.423]  It's here.
[01:20:32.423 --> 01:20:35.164]  He's going to build it out, and we're going to go out on Father's Day shooting.
[01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:35.784]  You want to come?
[01:20:35.784 --> 01:20:36.704]  And I said, yeah.
[01:20:36.704 --> 01:20:41.545]  What a great idea for a Father's Day gift, an AR-15 rifle kit from Guns80.com.
[01:20:41.545 --> 01:20:42.585]  I think I'll get my dad one.
[01:20:42.585 --> 01:20:43.545]  He says, go ahead.
[01:20:43.545 --> 01:20:44.306]  See you out on the range.
[01:20:44.306 --> 01:20:46.206]  So we're going to meet on the range on Father's Day.

[01:21:53.243 --> 01:21:56.666]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:21:57.447 --> 01:21:58.088]  It's true.
[01:21:58.088 --> 01:22:02.250]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:04.631]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:04.631 --> 01:22:09.434]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:22:09.434 --> 01:22:16.779]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA.
[01:22:17.119 --> 01:22:22.285]  Pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[01:22:52.988 --> 01:22:54.930]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:22:54.930 --> 01:22:58.553]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[01:22:58.553 --> 01:22:59.914]  A pair of scissors.
[01:22:59.914 --> 01:23:05.719]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[01:23:05.719 --> 01:23:10.643]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[01:23:10.643 --> 01:23:11.624]  The phone line.
[01:23:11.624 --> 01:23:16.888]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[01:23:16.888 --> 01:23:20.631]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[01:23:20.771 --> 01:23:24.095]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[01:23:24.095 --> 01:23:26.558]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[01:23:26.558 --> 01:23:30.903]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[01:23:30.903 --> 01:23:32.004]  Scissors can't cut it.
[01:23:32.004 --> 01:23:34.467]  And that means your home stays safe.
[01:23:34.467 --> 01:23:38.051]  24-7 professional monitoring is under $15 a month with no contract.
[01:23:38.251 --> 01:23:41.735]  SimpliSafe home security keeps you safer than the other guys.

[01:24:03.314 --> 01:24:19.346]  Bottom line, the globalists are setting up a system where it'll be impossible to live and survive unless you acquiesce to all their edicts and waive your rights and take all the inoculations, raise your children the way they say, take the implantable microchips.
[01:24:19.346 --> 01:24:23.709]  And this isn't from me, this is from textbooks they give British school children.
[01:24:23.709 --> 01:24:28.613]  This is from, no exaggeration, hundreds of books and publications
[01:24:29.775 --> 01:24:34.518]  Put out by the IMF, the World Bank, the think tanks.
[01:24:34.518 --> 01:24:41.263]  I remember Wash Tech, back when the Washington Post put out a technology magazine, monthly.
[01:24:41.263 --> 01:24:50.729]  And back then, a lot of stuff wasn't on the internet, like in 98, so I took subscriptions to the New York Times, Washington Post, Washington Times, LA Times, the office got them all in.
[01:24:50.729 --> 01:24:54.291]  Back then we had like five employees.
[01:24:54.291 --> 01:24:57.153]  And I would sit there and clip out newspaper clippings.
[01:24:57.153 --> 01:24:59.495]  A lot of TV viewers remember that, I'd be holding up clippings all day.
[01:25:02.131 --> 01:25:12.942]  And it was in there saying we're going to promote body piercings and body modification to get folks ready to accept implantable chips to buy and sell.
[01:25:12.942 --> 01:25:16.126]  They even used the Bible term.
[01:25:16.126 --> 01:25:22.993]  And we're going to roll out the smart internet and everything's going to be tracked by chips so small you can't see them.
[01:25:24.727 --> 01:25:30.432]  And that'll be an Internet of Things, and then with that data, we can basically put it into computers and predict the future.
[01:25:30.432 --> 01:25:31.634]  Well, now they can do it!
[01:25:31.634 --> 01:25:32.614]  They did it!
[01:25:32.614 --> 01:25:36.198]  That was 17 years ago!
[01:25:36.198 --> 01:25:38.380]  That's what's so frustrating!
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:41.403]  It's not me telling you this!
[01:25:41.403 --> 01:25:44.926]  They're saying it!
[01:25:44.926 --> 01:25:46.688]  And so, if you're gonna try to run off,
[01:25:50.293 --> 01:25:53.514]  And be left alone, they're coming after you.
[01:25:53.514 --> 01:25:59.996]  There are people getting pieces of property in England, people getting pieces of property in Germany, people getting pieces of property in Russia, in Mexico.
[01:25:59.996 --> 01:26:03.277]  That's why I buy from the Chiapas folks.
[01:26:03.277 --> 01:26:06.958]  They're indigenous, 15,000 years down there.
[01:26:06.958 --> 01:26:10.559]  They may even be socialists, but they fought off the government, but they call it socialist.
[01:26:10.559 --> 01:26:12.120]  Well, it works at a communal level.
[01:26:13.615 --> 01:26:14.315]  With farmers.
[01:26:14.315 --> 01:26:19.238]  But they're really capitalists selling their high-quality, non-GMO, organic, volcanic coffee.
[01:26:19.238 --> 01:26:22.020]  Wake of America coffee.
[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:26.063]  And they've got thousands of square miles that the Mexican government doesn't control now.
[01:26:26.063 --> 01:26:29.845]  That's some of the freest areas in Mexico.
[01:26:29.845 --> 01:26:31.226]  And they just won't comply with the government.
[01:26:31.226 --> 01:26:33.807]  They won't pay taxes.
[01:26:33.807 --> 01:26:42.493]  And when government ends up shooting and killing them, even though they've got like, in some cases, 100-year-old bolt-action rifles, they'll go kill a few of them, and the Mexican troops won't even go into the area.
[01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:49.391]  And all they got is bolt-action rifles.
[01:26:49.391 --> 01:26:54.332]  But they're willing to resist, and they got product ready to sell.
[01:26:54.332 --> 01:26:55.832]  And we buy it.
[01:26:55.832 --> 01:26:57.073]  Right out of Chiapas.
[01:26:57.073 --> 01:27:04.174]  Shipped up here on trucks.
[01:27:04.174 --> 01:27:04.774]  Look at this.
[01:27:04.774 --> 01:27:10.496]  New York State Senator proposes using GPS implants to track violent convicts.
[01:27:10.496 --> 01:27:11.676]  And you know what they did in Mexico?
[01:27:13.248 --> 01:27:28.593]  All over Mexico, from Yucatan to Northern Mexico, they forced people off their land in the last 30 years under UN biosphere zones as collateral on Mexico's debt and forced them all into the Maquiladoras on the border or into Mexico City.
[01:27:28.593 --> 01:27:36.536]  Mexico City went from 10 million 30 years ago to over 30 plus million today, the second most populous city in the world.
[01:27:36.536 --> 01:27:41.358]  Half the population lives in cardboard boxes by giant black rivers of sludge.
[01:27:42.921 --> 01:27:48.586]  Upwards of a third of the babies have a syndrome that are born without a higher brain.
[01:27:48.586 --> 01:27:49.347]  It's so toxic.
[01:27:49.347 --> 01:27:54.251]  You're going to hear Mecha and La Raza complaining about how the U.S.
[01:27:54.251 --> 01:28:01.198]  ships its batteries to Mexico City to be basically thrown right in the rivers after their cores are pulled out?
[01:28:01.198 --> 01:28:06.403]  Or how the Mexicans are all being forcibly injected with Gardasil to sterilize them?
[01:28:06.403 --> 01:28:06.543]  No.
[01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:09.411]  You will hear it here.
[01:28:09.411 --> 01:28:12.272]  All we do is tell the truth, let the chips fall where they are.
[01:28:12.272 --> 01:28:17.074]  And we're not into killing people.
[01:28:17.074 --> 01:28:25.558]  But New York State Senator, this is CBS News, proposes using GPS implant to track violent convicts.
[01:28:25.558 --> 01:28:33.182]  Senator Saratoga, or call Saratoga lawmaker, suggestions an overreaction to upstate prison break.
[01:28:34.964 --> 01:28:52.860]  Well they've released 36,000 violent illegal aliens just in the last year and act like it's the end of the world and checkpoints and whole towns under martial law looking for two guys when it was an inside job and the ladies admitted that for sex basically and then she got threatened by them and blackmailed into having them escape.
[01:28:54.127 --> 01:29:04.050]  That's how people with mass Stockholm Syndrome give in to government corporations that we've been abused by to follow more and more orders from them and only gets us in more trouble.
[01:29:04.050 --> 01:29:06.951]  I mean, I instantly said inside job when that happened.
[01:29:06.951 --> 01:29:17.514]  And it's usually some woman who they trick into having sex, some unattractive woman, nothing against her, but unattractive woman, those two unattractive men, they have sex with her and then they blackmail her.
[01:29:19.798 --> 01:29:23.179]  We're going to tell people we had sex if you don't give us a little more info.
[01:29:23.179 --> 01:29:34.024]  If you don't, then pretty soon if you don't show up with a getaway car, then of course they double-crossed her and didn't even show up.
[01:29:34.024 --> 01:29:36.885]  But meanwhile, they want everybody to have implantable microchips now.
[01:29:36.885 --> 01:29:38.366]  See, this is how they push it.
[01:29:40.017 --> 01:29:41.639]  And they act like it's gonna give us security.
[01:29:41.639 --> 01:29:42.160]  No, it won't.
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:43.441]  It'll be total enslavement.
[01:29:43.441 --> 01:29:44.823]  We're on the march.
[01:29:44.823 --> 01:29:46.445]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:46.445 --> 01:29:50.030]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.278 --> 01:30:01.140]  Minority Report style policing is here, with the article, Police Release Pre-Crime Smartphone App.
[01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:10.423]  Swiss police have released a pre-crime smartphone app, which warns users about crimes before they are committed, based on criminal prediction software.
[01:30:10.423 --> 01:30:20.967]  And across the world as well, numerous police departments in the US are also using similar technology, such as the Miami Police Department, which has adopted prediction software.
[01:30:21.707 --> 01:30:25.052]  And understandably, the app has some people concerned.
[01:30:25.052 --> 01:30:37.909]  We've heard stories of people driving off bridges and into bodies of water because their GPS app told them to do so, so it's very possible that you could be harassed just because you're in the wrong place at the wrong time.
[01:30:38.630 --> 01:30:45.414]  And contrast this with the Waze app, which among many other things allowed you to tag the locations of police officers.
[01:30:45.414 --> 01:30:48.356]  And many officers said that was unacceptable.
[01:30:48.356 --> 01:30:51.978]  You can find more reports on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[01:30:54.187 --> 01:30:59.910]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[01:30:59.910 --> 01:31:14.359]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[01:31:14.619 --> 01:31:22.625]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[01:31:22.625 --> 01:31:28.049]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[01:31:28.049 --> 01:31:31.751]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[01:31:31.751 --> 01:31:35.894]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.

[01:32:23.926 --> 01:32:24.927]  Alex Jones here.
[01:32:24.927 --> 01:32:34.213]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:32:34.213 --> 01:32:37.996]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[01:32:37.996 --> 01:32:46.342]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.

[01:32:48.664 --> 01:32:49.704]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:33:09.642 --> 01:33:15.724]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:15.724 --> 01:33:25.988]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.988 --> 01:33:28.448]  So we're all being herded into these high-tech prisons.
[01:33:28.448 --> 01:33:31.890]  We call them our cars, we call them our homes.
[01:33:31.890 --> 01:33:35.931]  New York State Senate is proposing using GPS implants to track violent convicts.
[01:33:35.931 --> 01:33:37.952]  It's high-tech and certainly controversial.
[01:33:37.952 --> 01:33:38.972]  Oh, it's just controversial.
[01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:52.778]  But with two prisoners from the Clinton Correctional Facility still on the lam as if they wouldn't dig the chips out, an upstate senator says the one way to track future escapees is to microchip them.
[01:33:52.778 --> 01:33:59.723]  Bloodhounds and expensive manhunts are so yesterday, especially when you let 36,000 violent illegals out this year.
[01:33:59.723 --> 01:34:01.544]  It's all just hysteria.
[01:34:01.544 --> 01:34:03.045]  Everything's about a power grab.
[01:34:03.045 --> 01:34:04.526]  Martial law in a whole bunch of towns.
[01:34:05.899 --> 01:34:16.044]  When it comes to hunting escaped prisoners, that's the opinion of one lawmaker who says the state should explore implanting tiny GPS devices under the convict's skin.
[01:34:16.044 --> 01:34:19.726]  Oh, they'll end up catching these guys because they're in the system.
[01:34:19.726 --> 01:34:24.849]  But instead they want a bunch of paramilitary guys saying, we're searching every house in the town.
[01:34:24.849 --> 01:34:26.350]  And they search like four or five towns.
[01:34:26.350 --> 01:34:28.571]  And be like, you're not searching my house.
[01:34:28.571 --> 01:34:29.171]  Oh, yeah?
[01:34:29.171 --> 01:34:30.131]  We're in charge.
[01:34:30.131 --> 01:34:31.172]  Watch.
[01:34:31.172 --> 01:34:32.593]  Well, America never did this before.
[01:34:32.593 --> 01:34:34.834]  It ain't America no more, huh?
[01:34:37.057 --> 01:34:41.158]  Others say microchipping criminals could have multiple uses.
[01:34:41.158 --> 01:34:49.280]  If you've got convicted murderers, the type of people these two men are, it would make some good sense at the level that we should have something that we could track them.
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:54.741]  Said Senator Kathy Marchione.
[01:34:54.741 --> 01:35:03.643]  With 800 law enforcement officials, not servants, still unable to pick up the trail of escaped murderers, Richard Matt and David Sweet, the suggestion
[01:35:04.744 --> 01:35:10.050]  To implant microchips in people who are convicted of serious crimes is picking up steam!
[01:35:10.050 --> 01:35:10.551]  See?
[01:35:10.551 --> 01:35:12.634]  It's a PR piece!
[01:35:12.634 --> 01:35:17.820]  And of course they're going to have to be implanted beneath the skull to make sure you don't dig them out.
[01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:18.661]  That'll be next.
[01:35:18.661 --> 01:35:19.982]  But they don't want to say that up front.
[01:35:24.571 --> 01:35:26.853]  Why not have them be explodable?
[01:35:26.853 --> 01:35:35.020]  By the way, Homeland Security's had three meetings the last four years, seriously pushing and considering making everyone wear a taser bracelet when you fly.
[01:35:35.020 --> 01:35:37.021]  Everyone.
[01:35:37.021 --> 01:35:39.944]  Everyone.
[01:35:39.944 --> 01:35:49.051]  Because you're all criminals, except the government, who is openly funding the real Islamic terrorist.
[01:35:49.051 --> 01:35:52.394]  We're gonna go to our guest here in just a moment.
[01:35:57.287 --> 01:36:10.270]  Gingy Friedman, the evil person who made national news about a month ago, threatened his mom with a $1,000 per day fine if she keeps miniature goats needed to feed her babies.
[01:36:10.270 --> 01:36:13.631]  There's a war on chickens even in quasi and rural areas.
[01:36:13.631 --> 01:36:18.532]  I see articles where somebody will be cleaning a deer and a yuppie drives by and calls the police.
[01:36:18.532 --> 01:36:21.173]  He's torturing a deer and the cops come out like it's real.
[01:36:22.435 --> 01:36:24.956]  They'll walk up, the guy's under a tree in his front yard in the country.
[01:36:24.956 --> 01:36:26.597]  Yeah, I shot the deer, it was my license.
[01:36:26.597 --> 01:36:27.478]  What's going on?
[01:36:27.478 --> 01:36:30.980]  He's like, well, did you torture it?
[01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:41.165]  I remember the famous thing where the grandpa killed the rat that was eating his tomatoes and the rest of it.
[01:36:41.165 --> 01:36:43.566]  Because that's how they operate.
[01:36:43.566 --> 01:36:45.507]  We're going to talk to her in just a moment.
[01:36:48.766 --> 01:37:03.331]  We have a formula based on thousands of years of well-known, across the board, from Asia to Ancient Greece to Rome to the Mesoamericans, a whole fusion of different global herbs known to open up the liver to help it detox.
[01:37:03.331 --> 01:37:09.693]  You can take Liver Shield every day, a couple droppers full, and it's had an amazing effect.
[01:37:09.693 --> 01:37:12.194]  Or you can also do once a month or twice a month.
[01:37:13.570 --> 01:37:42.063]  A month, and pretty much as much as you want, a liver cleanse where you take oxy powder to flush your guts out, just higher level oxygen, take the liver shield, mix it with a gallon of water, drink it over the week, and then also take apple cider vinegar, we don't sell that, organic apple cider vinegar, get it at any major grocery store, preferably organic, that's living, it's probiotic, and that just opens up your liver and your gallbladder, and on the sixth night, you just drink six, seven ounces of olive oil,
[01:37:44.159 --> 01:37:49.621]  And you go lay on your right side that your liver and gallbladder are on for an hour before you fall asleep, read a book.
[01:37:49.621 --> 01:37:58.685]  And let me tell you, most people, over 90% of thousands we know have done this, it is in the morning it happens.
[01:37:58.685 --> 01:38:00.926]  If it's really clogged up, it takes sometimes three or four days.
[01:38:00.926 --> 01:38:01.786]  It took me two days.
[01:38:01.786 --> 01:38:04.107]  And I was calling Dr. Gribbs saying, it didn't work for me.
[01:38:04.107 --> 01:38:05.888]  And he goes, man, you must be really clogged up.
[01:38:05.888 --> 01:38:08.449]  Do another gallbladder cleanse.
[01:38:08.449 --> 01:38:09.790]  He said, give it another day and wait.
[01:38:10.498 --> 01:38:16.602]  Well, a few hours later, I went with friends to the Alamo Draft House movie, and before I walked in, I said, I'll meet you in there.
[01:38:16.602 --> 01:38:23.266]  And man, I don't like to get graphic, but you know, let's be adults here when you talk about this.
[01:38:23.266 --> 01:38:27.669]  30 or 40 black stones.
[01:38:27.669 --> 01:38:30.711]  About a third the size of a penny.
[01:38:30.711 --> 01:38:32.012]  Weldon says he'll talk about it.
[01:38:32.012 --> 01:38:36.955]  He about 15 the size of quarters, you know, big marbles.
[01:38:36.955 --> 01:38:37.876]  And it was painful for him.
[01:38:39.119 --> 01:38:43.644]  So, warning folks, most people it's not painful, but everything we promote is not a game.
[01:38:43.644 --> 01:38:52.954]  It's hardcore, the most hardcore stuff out there, if you want to try to get all the toxins, because all the plasticizers and chemicals, your gallbladder doesn't know how to deal with them.
[01:38:52.954 --> 01:38:59.561]  And so that's why gallbladders are busting and, you know, having problems at record levels and being removed, is because they're just full of all this crud.
[01:39:01.405 --> 01:39:03.847]  And there's also liver stones you can pass.
[01:39:03.847 --> 01:39:10.232]  So most people, I'd say 98%, it's very rare you'll have pain.
[01:39:10.232 --> 01:39:14.936]  But I mean, if you've got them the size of golf balls, which they can get up to even bigger, yeah, it's not going to feel too hot.
[01:39:16.203 --> 01:39:20.665]  They say it's painful for a man's birth to pass a good-sized kidney stone.
[01:39:20.665 --> 01:39:22.365]  Well, with that, it's a tiny opening.
[01:39:22.365 --> 01:39:26.727]  The good news is, is that, you know, you're used to passing things that are, you know, golf ball size or whatever.
[01:39:26.727 --> 01:39:28.127]  It's not going to be fine.
[01:39:28.127 --> 01:39:33.349]  And I hate to get gross here, but people need to know, believe me, just wait till you do it.
[01:39:33.349 --> 01:39:39.331]  And you, I mean, it might take, some people are really clogged up after two or three cleanses, but that's like two, three percent.
[01:39:41.004 --> 01:39:43.550]  And I don't want to go into details, but then it's like a flamethrower, folks.
[01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:46.899]  I mean, reportedly, it's like something out of a comedy.
[01:39:46.899 --> 01:39:48.182]  I mean, we're talking projectile.
[01:39:49.219 --> 01:39:55.261]  And this is what's in us, and it just builds up, and that gallbladder burst, folks.
[01:39:55.261 --> 01:40:02.683]  In fact, just Google burst gallbladder, or gallbladder stones, and look at them for yourself, just busting open with these things.
[01:40:02.683 --> 01:40:06.484]  So, me personally, I always think I know everything, and I learned how ignorant I am.
[01:40:06.484 --> 01:40:08.525]  For years, they tried to get me to do this cleanse.
[01:40:08.525 --> 01:40:09.525]  I rolled my eyes.
[01:40:09.525 --> 01:40:12.526]  I've never had kidney stones, never had gallstones that I knew of.
[01:40:12.526 --> 01:40:13.706]  I said, that's ridiculous.
[01:40:13.706 --> 01:40:14.647]  I'm not listening to you.
[01:40:14.647 --> 01:40:15.267]  That's crazy.
[01:40:16.485 --> 01:40:16.665]  I don't
[01:40:32.878 --> 01:40:36.160]  You notice, we just happened to have some in the refrigerator from Anthony doing it months ago.
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:38.362]  Another crew do it all the time.
[01:40:38.362 --> 01:40:41.124]  We need to get more of the organic apple cider vinegar.
[01:40:41.124 --> 01:40:42.325]  We're out of that.
[01:40:42.325 --> 01:40:46.868]  And I've just been like specifically begging folks to go get it for me, but I haven't said, well, you go get it.
[01:40:46.868 --> 01:40:47.428]  I'm out.
[01:40:47.428 --> 01:40:53.973]  Will somebody go right now to Whole Foods or Central Market and get me the Bragg brand, the oldest brand out there?
[01:40:53.973 --> 01:40:57.615]  Because I need to be doing that four times a day or it doesn't work as well.
[01:40:57.615 --> 01:40:58.175]  That's the thing.
[01:40:58.175 --> 01:40:58.716]  I'll be honest.
[01:40:59.943 --> 01:41:00.824]  They have a word for it.
[01:41:00.824 --> 01:41:02.345]  Half, you know what it did.
[01:41:02.345 --> 01:41:04.486]  I kind of half-butted it.
[01:41:04.486 --> 01:41:05.727]  Pun intended.
[01:41:05.727 --> 01:41:10.691]  Last time, I didn't do it, I didn't follow it exactly, and it still worked.
[01:41:10.691 --> 01:41:16.315]  So I said this time, in fact, I'm just restarting today, and then I'll do the thing Monday.
[01:41:16.315 --> 01:41:18.957]  Because I really haven't been doing it, I just realized that.
[01:41:18.957 --> 01:41:24.582]  See, look, I know why it's hard to do this stuff, folks, because it takes time, it takes focus, but you purchase,
[01:41:25.532 --> 01:41:28.073]  The liver shield at Infowarslife.com.
[01:41:28.073 --> 01:41:30.713]  You purchased the oxy powder at Infowarslife.com.
[01:41:30.713 --> 01:41:32.934]  You purchased the apple cider vinegar at the store or wherever.
[01:41:32.934 --> 01:41:34.655]  Olive oil, extra virgin.
[01:41:34.655 --> 01:41:42.317]  And man, it is just amazing that people don't seem to know about this, because it just sounded insane.
[01:41:42.317 --> 01:41:47.338]  They pushed me for over a year to do this, and it is spectacular.
[01:41:47.338 --> 01:41:50.299]  And you feel so much better after it's happened.
[01:41:50.299 --> 01:41:54.060]  You know, they say John Wayne had 40 pounds of you-know-what just in his intestines.
[01:41:56.843 --> 01:42:02.347]  Just the oxy powder alone, within a couple days, you won't believe what's going on.
[01:42:02.347 --> 01:42:04.268]  Again, I want to save lives here.
[01:42:04.268 --> 01:42:06.810]  I want to also fund her operation with something that's really good.
[01:42:06.810 --> 01:42:10.573]  I feel really good about this, and I hate to talk about it, but I'm just getting over it.
[01:42:10.573 --> 01:42:11.614]  I'm a private guy.
[01:42:11.614 --> 01:42:12.074]  I don't get in.
[01:42:12.074 --> 01:42:13.075]  I'm on a two-year-old.
[01:42:13.075 --> 01:42:14.636]  I don't talk about bodily functions.
[01:42:14.636 --> 01:42:17.018]  This is a medical health issue we're discussing here.
[01:42:17.018 --> 01:42:17.838]  Consult your physician.
[01:42:17.838 --> 01:42:18.579]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:42:24.116 --> 01:42:28.760]  Now we're joined by Gingy Friedman, who I appreciate holding while I was ranting.
[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:33.743]  Gingy Friedman is another victim of Agenda 21, the attempt to domesticate everybody.
[01:42:33.743 --> 01:42:42.990]  She tried to raise a couple of miniature goats, a practice that's gone on forever, to produce milk, which is a super high quality for children that can't hold down their mother's milk.
[01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:46.213]  That and Jenny milk, or Jackass milk, was most popular in Europe.
[01:42:47.282 --> 01:42:49.204]  They say jackass milk is the best.
[01:42:49.204 --> 01:42:52.766]  If you can't get anything else, go with goat.
[01:42:52.766 --> 01:42:57.390]  Town threatens mom with $1,000 per day fine if she keeps goats needed to feed her babies.
[01:42:57.390 --> 01:43:03.775]  Now they're waging war on solar panels all over the country if you don't hook into their grid.
[01:43:03.775 --> 01:43:07.297]  Or, I have a friend, I didn't want to go on air, who has a wind turbine.
[01:43:07.297 --> 01:43:11.440]  And a county visited him saying, we want you to get a license for that.
[01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:12.681]  We have a regulation.
[01:43:12.681 --> 01:43:14.483]  We want you to hook in to the grid.
[01:43:15.199 --> 01:43:19.162]  You know, you don't have a license to run that, your batteries could blow up.
[01:43:19.162 --> 01:43:22.605]  Well yeah, and an Easter Bunny can crawl out from underneath the table and bite my legs off.
[01:43:22.605 --> 01:43:26.948]  I mean, it's just, you can't have a lemonade stand without a license.
[01:43:26.948 --> 01:43:29.330]  You can't play tag, it's aggressive.
[01:43:29.330 --> 01:43:31.572]  I mean, this nanny state is called a prison state.
[01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:33.270]  So, Ms.
[01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:34.450]  Friedman, thank you so much.
[01:43:34.450 --> 01:43:37.631]  It's I'mProGoat.com.
[01:43:37.631 --> 01:43:41.492]  These are humans all over the world fighting back against domestication.
[01:43:41.492 --> 01:43:42.973]  I'mProGoat.com.
[01:43:42.973 --> 01:43:50.875]  And we've got right-wingers, we've got left-wingers, we've got moms, we've got dads, we've got black, white, Hispanic, old, young, getting back to the land.
[01:43:50.875 --> 01:43:54.116]  It doesn't mean you have to go 100%, but people are doing it partially.
[01:43:54.116 --> 01:43:56.477]  And it's really exciting to see this happening.
[01:43:56.477 --> 01:44:00.278]  Thank you for coming on, and please tell us your story and what you've gone through.
[01:44:05.248 --> 01:44:08.410]  Yeah, thank you for having me on, first of all.
[01:44:08.410 --> 01:44:12.834]  Basically, I was born with a congenital birth defect.
[01:44:12.834 --> 01:44:16.396]  It's an abnormality called tuberous breast tip plasia.
[01:44:16.396 --> 01:44:22.401]  So when I was a teenager, I had some reconstructive surgery done that ended up removing all of my breast tissue.
[01:44:22.401 --> 01:44:30.127]  And the defect by itself actually makes it where you can't produce breast milk anyway.
[01:44:30.127 --> 01:44:32.909]  So I was born unable to breastfeed children, basically.
[01:44:35.188 --> 01:44:42.633]  In an effort to basically get away from, you know, Monsanto's GMOs and things that are prevalent in infant formula.
[01:44:42.633 --> 01:44:49.217]  Last study that I looked at, it's supposed to be over 90% of infant formula is GMO contaminated.
[01:44:49.217 --> 01:44:53.400]  We don't have to label that and say that there's GMOs in the formula.
[01:44:54.031 --> 01:44:54.712]  I don't know.
[01:45:12.132 --> 01:45:17.736]  I don't want my children to suffer because of my lack of ability to give them what nature intended.
[01:45:17.736 --> 01:45:23.419]  So, uh, the best option in lieu of human breast milk would be goat milk.
[01:45:23.419 --> 01:45:26.361]  Well, Gingy, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but what you're saying is so important.
[01:45:26.361 --> 01:45:30.703]  Your Skype is degraded to the point that the audio is almost inaudible.
[01:45:30.703 --> 01:45:32.124]  We're going to call you on your phone.
[01:45:32.124 --> 01:45:39.869]  We'll keep the Skype connected as well to see if it gets better so we have a visual, but we're going to call you on the phone right now.
[01:45:39.869 --> 01:45:40.169]  Let me...
[01:45:43.274 --> 01:45:47.117]  Now let me go ahead and read some of the article while we connect with her.
[01:45:47.117 --> 01:45:55.362]  Town threatens mom with $1,000 per day fine if she keeps goats needed to feed her babies.
[01:45:55.362 --> 01:45:59.925]  But the southern border is wide open and folks are just running across by the thousands every day in front of the Border Patrol.
[01:45:59.925 --> 01:46:05.689]  I guess they didn't get the memo, they could just walk over, be put on a bus and given a voucher to drive in wherever they want.
[01:46:05.689 --> 01:46:11.233]  The city of, let's see if I pronounced that right, this font is tiny, Vizsala,
[01:46:14.246 --> 01:46:19.612]  California has given resident an impossible choice.
[01:46:19.612 --> 01:46:25.659]  Get rid of the miniature goats she relies on for milk for her babies, or pay a thousand dollar a day fine.
[01:46:25.659 --> 01:46:34.970]  And the good news is, everywhere people fight not being able to garden in their yard, not being able to garden in the public commons, not being able to have chickens or goats, everywhere people fight this.
[01:46:36.872 --> 01:46:40.654]  It is basically being defeated.
[01:46:40.654 --> 01:46:49.978]  Freeman must give up her two pet Nigerian dwarf goats within 10 days because city officials, not servants, have declared them livestock.
[01:46:49.978 --> 01:46:58.962]  Freeman needs the goats to feed her two daughters, ages 2 and 19 months, because as a teenager she had a breast tissue removed due to a birth defect.
[01:46:58.962 --> 01:47:00.083]  And thank you so much.
[01:47:00.083 --> 01:47:00.663]  Sorry about that.
[01:47:00.663 --> 01:47:02.204]  We've got you lined up now.
[01:47:02.204 --> 01:47:04.265]  Please recap what you were saying and get back into it.
[01:47:05.262 --> 01:47:08.085]  Yeah, so basically, I'm unable to breastfeed.
[01:47:08.085 --> 01:47:11.888]  So, in this effort to give my children the best.
[01:47:12.601 --> 01:47:17.564]  And not subject them to GMO formula, I decided to get some goats.
[01:47:17.564 --> 01:47:34.093]  And the reason why I had to go to Goats by the Way is because I'm located in California and the raw milk industry is so over-regulated and so mired down in fees that to get one gallon of raw goat milk, it's about $32 a gallon.
[01:47:34.093 --> 01:47:36.654]  And my daughters actually drink that in four days.
[01:47:37.509 --> 01:47:45.055]  So, my husband's military, I'm a stay-at-home mom, I went into homeschool, and we frankly just can't afford that.
[01:47:45.055 --> 01:47:53.142]  So, in order for me to have my two miniature Nigerian dwarfs, it's only $19 a month in organic feed to get them, you know, GMO-free.
[01:47:53.142 --> 01:47:59.327]  But you should just be buying some GMO formula that's 80% corn syrup from the Walmart nearby.
[01:48:00.345 --> 01:48:02.586]  Right, why not?
[01:48:02.586 --> 01:48:11.391]  So that's basically where we were at and then we did get the... We had our ghosts for close to a year and then we got the notice from the city that we had to get rid of them.
[01:48:11.391 --> 01:48:18.255]  And what's really amazing to me is that I got it on a Friday night when I opened the mail.
[01:48:18.255 --> 01:48:19.856]  I couldn't sleep that night.
[01:48:19.856 --> 01:48:21.197]  It made me sick.
[01:48:21.197 --> 01:48:22.617]  It's 4 a.m.
[01:48:22.617 --> 01:48:23.258]  I just couldn't sleep.
[01:48:23.258 --> 01:48:23.738]  So 4 a.m.
[01:48:23.738 --> 01:48:27.140]  in the morning, I get up, go on Facebook, explain what's going on.
[01:48:27.890 --> 01:48:34.233]  Within an hour, I had local news reporters contacting me, 5 in the morning, asking if they could interview.
[01:48:34.233 --> 01:48:37.134]  The community stepped out in a huge way.
[01:48:37.134 --> 01:48:41.075]  The overwhelming majority in my city wants my goats back.
[01:48:41.075 --> 01:48:43.476]  They want, and now that we are seeing some
[01:48:45.546 --> 01:48:54.549]  You know, as far as we're talking about small food producing animals, there's a huge movement wanting chickens and wanting rabbits, and people are wanting to be self-sufficient.
[01:48:54.549 --> 01:49:03.072]  In less than a month, we got more signatures than elected the local school superintendent.
[01:49:03.072 --> 01:49:06.433]  We have the numbers, we have the people who want this, and despite
[01:49:07.389 --> 01:49:10.470]  Huge valleys, massive worldwide coverage.
[01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:14.071]  We actually had a news crew from Japan fly in to cover the story.
[01:49:14.071 --> 01:49:26.395]  Despite all of this media attention and overwhelming support, our city council members decided to vote 3-2 against allowing chickens and returning my miniature goat.
[01:49:26.395 --> 01:49:35.478]  So you've got to then remove them from office, and of course they won't do this, just like Congress, upwards of 90% are against the TPP, the treaty, but
[01:49:36.485 --> 01:49:49.917]  They're still trying to go ahead with it because the elite want this, and if we ever get back fruit trees and chickens, even a small percentage of people, if we ever get somewhat self-sufficient and find out about the quality and how good it is, it's game over.
[01:49:49.917 --> 01:49:57.763]  Just like McDonald's is collapsing, Coca-Cola's collapsing, all these globalist corporations are collapsing because of voting with our dollars.
[01:49:57.763 --> 01:50:02.547]  They are scared to death of you, and thank God you took that initiative to tell your story
[01:50:03.248 --> 01:50:07.594]  Now if others tell their story, we can expose what's happening, and we can push back.
[01:50:07.594 --> 01:50:18.087]  Because they know, if the dam breaks on this, the fluoride's gonna get pulled, people are gonna learn they have power, and through that manifestation of we the people, it's game over.
[01:50:19.272 --> 01:50:28.497]  Exactly, and actually what we're doing at this point now, in fact it's kind of funny because after the city council meeting I had all these reporters coming up going, oh how do you feel about this?
[01:50:28.497 --> 01:50:30.358]  You know, how are you taking this defeat?
[01:50:30.358 --> 01:50:33.240]  And I pretty much kind of laughed at them and said, you know what?
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:34.180]  This isn't over.
[01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:43.105]  As Americans, we, our founding fathers created one of the best forms of government in giving, letting people have recourse.
[01:50:43.105 --> 01:50:48.148]  The problem is there's so much apathy that we're letting our rights being taken away and we're not taking them back.
[01:50:48.188 --> 01:50:52.070]  That's right, you're an incredible mama.
[01:50:52.070 --> 01:50:52.751]  I've got to go to break.
[01:50:52.751 --> 01:50:54.432]  What a great American we're talking to, and a mother.
[01:50:54.432 --> 01:50:58.554]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:50:58.554 --> 01:51:01.736]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:01.736 --> 01:51:03.357]  Does that sound right to you?

[01:54:01.530 --> 01:54:22.594]  I get excited when I'm talking to a smart, lovely, intelligent, fighting person.
[01:54:22.594 --> 01:54:23.934]  Especially a woman.
[01:54:23.934 --> 01:54:28.635]  It's just so refreshing to see women out there that were like, say, my dad's mom.
[01:54:29.465 --> 01:54:32.386]  Who are nice and sweet and feminine, but aren't going to be pushed around.
[01:54:32.386 --> 01:54:35.687]  And the fact that, oh, you got defeated!
[01:54:35.687 --> 01:54:36.487]  I got defeated?
[01:54:36.487 --> 01:54:46.770]  She's had a huge international victory showing it's illegal to try to produce your own food in most areas of the country with animals that are designed to be in very small places.
[01:54:46.770 --> 01:54:51.271]  And again, if communities want to vote to do this and it's popular, it should be done.
[01:54:51.271 --> 01:54:53.672]  You want to live in a fancy area where people don't do that?
[01:54:54.707 --> 01:55:00.732]  Believe me, it's going to get so in vogue, actually a lot of rich people actually have their own animals and horses and pigs and all the rest of it.
[01:55:00.732 --> 01:55:02.754]  The point is, we need to get back to this.
[01:55:02.754 --> 01:55:04.316]  We're losing our humanity.
[01:55:04.316 --> 01:55:10.301]  The corporate borg are trying to end human agriculture right now.
[01:55:10.301 --> 01:55:11.222]  This is the takeover.
[01:55:12.841 --> 01:55:15.445]  Look at our story, it's on DrugsReport.com today.
[01:55:15.445 --> 01:55:20.492]  Privacy expert, time-traveling robots could punish future crimes.
[01:55:20.492 --> 01:55:27.101]  And they're time-traveling, back in time, looking at your records, and then they project forward in time.
[01:55:27.101 --> 01:55:29.164]  And can predict, they say, almost 100%.
[01:55:32.016 --> 01:55:33.297]  It's 2015, folks.
[01:55:33.297 --> 01:55:34.718]  It's Buck Rogersville.
[01:55:34.718 --> 01:55:37.500]  We've got about five minutes left here, five minutes to the next segment.
[01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:41.783]  I want to get Mrs. Freeman back on soon.
[01:55:41.783 --> 01:55:42.703]  Simply amazing.
[01:55:42.703 --> 01:55:44.625]  So where are your goats now?
[01:55:44.625 --> 01:55:46.226]  Where does the fight go next?
[01:55:46.226 --> 01:55:52.410]  How do you recall the city council people that voted against the will of the people?
[01:55:52.410 --> 01:55:57.633]  Well, basically my goats are actually with a young woman who lives just outside of town.
[01:55:57.633 --> 01:55:59.214]  She's watching them for me in the meantime.
[01:56:01.397 --> 01:56:22.302]  As of right now, the only way that we can get this unjust law overturned, this overbearing ordinance, is if we take the power out of our corrupt elected officials who are out of touch with the public and have no desire to do their job correctly, which is to be a representative of the people, and to put the power back into the hands of the people.
[01:56:22.902 --> 01:56:27.545]  The way we can do this is through a ballot initiative, and that's what we've done so far.
[01:56:27.545 --> 01:56:38.833]  Since we got the verdict from the City Council, we have actually created a political action committee called Urban Farmers for Food Freedom, and we're in the process right now.
[01:56:38.833 --> 01:56:46.999]  We actually have a local law firm who is working for us pro bono and are very supportive of our cause, Mellow and Farsfield LLP here in Visalia, California.
[01:56:46.999 --> 01:56:48.460]  They're drafting the initiative for us.
[01:56:49.293 --> 01:56:53.797]  And we basically are going to get this on the ballot, hopefully by June.
[01:56:53.797 --> 01:56:58.161]  In the meantime, we actually are fundraising, so we could actually use a lot of help right now.
[01:56:58.161 --> 01:57:08.550]  As of right now, we don't have enough funds to get that on the ballot, but if you'd like to, you can go to our website, improvote.com, and donate there at our GoFundMe.
[01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:12.873]  But I am absolutely confident based off of the petitions.
[01:57:12.873 --> 01:57:14.254]  Our petition wasn't a legal petition.
[01:57:14.254 --> 01:57:18.037]  It was more like a show of hands, like how many people want this to be done.
[01:57:18.037 --> 01:57:33.749]  But the support in the community is overwhelming that if this is put to the people, if the vote is put to the people, I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that we will be able to allow small food-producing animals in Visalia, California that would restore property rights and food freedom rights to over 130,000 individuals.
[01:57:38.638 --> 01:57:40.419]  Yeah, that's kind of where we are right now.
[01:57:40.419 --> 01:57:42.280]  It's a little upsetting for me.
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:44.282]  One of my goats actually is pregnant right now.
[01:57:44.282 --> 01:57:45.382]  She's due in September.
[01:57:45.382 --> 01:57:49.405]  I was really hoping to have her home prior to her kidding.
[01:57:49.405 --> 01:57:54.348]  But, you know, I'm looking at my options as far as possibly moving them to my parents.
[01:57:54.348 --> 01:57:56.250]  They live in a neighboring city in the country.
[01:57:56.250 --> 01:57:59.672]  So that's where we are right now.
[01:57:59.672 --> 01:58:01.873]  Just trying to raise funds.
[01:58:01.873 --> 01:58:04.275]  I mean, even like donations of stamps are fantastic.
[01:58:04.275 --> 01:58:04.575]  It helps us.
[01:58:04.575 --> 01:58:07.217]  What does your husband, who's in the military, think about this?
[01:58:08.752 --> 01:58:10.692]  Uh, he's incredibly supportive.
[01:58:10.692 --> 01:58:15.933]  What's actually really surprising is, uh, everyone in his shop is very, very supportive as well.
[01:58:15.933 --> 01:58:20.934]  People are wearing, I mean, we've been making a lot of stickers and bumper stickers have gone a little viral.
[01:58:20.934 --> 01:58:21.194]  That's right.
[01:58:21.194 --> 01:58:21.574]  Stay there.
[01:58:21.574 --> 01:58:29.035]  I want to hear more about this when we come back in one minute and how folks can fundraise and support you, because this fight is everybody's fight worldwide.
[01:58:29.035 --> 01:58:33.176]  You see, instinctively, we know we're being removed from the land to be imprisoned.
[01:58:33.176 --> 01:58:37.297]  Instinctively, we, we, we lust after going back to the land.
[01:58:37.297 --> 01:58:37.697]  Stay with us.
[01:58:38.197 --> 01:58:44.041]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:44.041 --> 01:58:52.366]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the Nightly News, or the news website, InfoWars.com.
[01:58:52.366 --> 01:59:00.972]  Because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[01:59:00.972 --> 01:59:04.214]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[01:59:04.534 --> 01:59:08.596]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.

[01:59:46.597 --> 01:59:49.219]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:59:59.980 --> 02:00:01.302]  Big Brother.
[02:00:01.302 --> 02:00:03.065]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:03.065 --> 02:00:04.827]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:04.827 --> 02:00:06.429]  You want answers?
[02:00:06.429 --> 02:00:07.952]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:07.952 --> 02:00:12.158]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:12.158 --> 02:00:16.204]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:19.051 --> 02:00:33.676]  Gingy Freeman, I'mProGoat.com, I am Pro Goat, I-M-P-R-O Goat.com, is fighting to be able to have two little goats in her backyard that she then milks and give to her children.
[02:00:33.676 --> 02:00:37.558]  This is a medical condition, having to have her breast tissue removed when she was a young woman.
[02:00:39.546 --> 02:00:44.688]  And look, I've had neighbors even in, you know, middle class areas I've lived in that had some chickens in their backyard.
[02:00:44.688 --> 02:00:46.209]  They looked kind of cool.
[02:00:46.209 --> 02:00:48.830]  Hopping up and down on the fence and sometimes getting in my backyard.
[02:00:48.830 --> 02:00:54.211]  And just think how alien it is that some people don't like.
[02:00:54.211 --> 02:00:59.613]  Now I had neighbors that had peacocks and they would get downright annoying.
[02:00:59.613 --> 02:01:00.774]  But in a way it was kind of cool.
[02:01:00.774 --> 02:01:02.114]  But man, they screech.
[02:01:02.114 --> 02:01:06.056]  But then owls killed them, so I guess that took care of that problem.
[02:01:07.762 --> 02:01:12.123]  Everybody knows that peacocks only have about six months because the owls come in and take them out.
[02:01:12.123 --> 02:01:15.705]  At night, they don't even eat them, they just fly in and kill them.
[02:01:15.705 --> 02:01:18.645]  High speed, boom, basically knock their heads off.
[02:01:18.645 --> 02:01:20.546]  Break their necks.
[02:01:20.546 --> 02:01:23.087]  But, uh, radon owls are amazing.
[02:01:24.369 --> 02:01:27.972]  One time I saw one kill a pigeon sitting on a power line.
[02:01:27.972 --> 02:01:30.294]  It was getting dark and this big owl just flies by.
[02:01:30.294 --> 02:01:30.715]  Pow!
[02:01:30.715 --> 02:01:34.498]  Hits that pigeon and feathers just explode.
[02:01:34.498 --> 02:01:35.559]  And didn't grab the pigeon.
[02:01:35.559 --> 02:01:37.361]  Just killed it for sport, I guess.
[02:01:37.361 --> 02:01:41.985]  Saw a hawk kill a pigeon off a power pole one time, but it hit the ground and the hawk came down.
[02:01:41.985 --> 02:01:45.809]  Red-tailed hawk grabbed it to the apartment complex I lived at and took off.
[02:01:45.809 --> 02:01:46.449]  Side issue.
[02:01:47.970 --> 02:01:49.931]  Genji Friedman, I'm ProGoat.com.
[02:01:49.931 --> 02:01:51.793]  You've got about three or four minutes left.
[02:01:51.793 --> 02:01:55.796]  I want to invite you on the nightly news with an update for a full 30 minutes in the near future.
[02:01:55.796 --> 02:02:01.099]  What else do you want to impart to folks about this fight where they've banned your goats?
[02:02:01.099 --> 02:02:04.182]  Well, basically, we've reached a point where
[02:02:05.126 --> 02:02:12.907]  The reason why the government is able to get away with what they're getting away with is because we're just complacent, and we're apathetic, and we're letting it happen.
[02:02:12.907 --> 02:02:18.348]  We're letting this overbearing government take away our basic God-given rights.
[02:02:18.348 --> 02:02:20.909]  And, I mean, this isn't just property rights.
[02:02:20.909 --> 02:02:22.549]  This isn't just food freedom rights.
[02:02:22.549 --> 02:02:31.191]  I mean, we've reached a point where, especially in California, not only do we have a government telling me what I can... My goats are... They're tiny.
[02:02:31.191 --> 02:02:32.931]  You can see in the picture, that's a full-grown goat.
[02:02:34.738 --> 02:02:36.179]  That produces milk for my child.
[02:02:36.179 --> 02:02:38.140]  So cute!
[02:02:38.140 --> 02:02:39.821]  They come up to my knee.
[02:02:39.821 --> 02:02:42.383]  They're quieter than dogs.
[02:02:42.383 --> 02:02:45.065]  One of my neighbors didn't know I had them for almost half a year.
[02:02:45.065 --> 02:02:49.668]  They don't break any pre-existing ordinances.
[02:02:49.668 --> 02:02:51.269]  They're actually the perfect neighbors.
[02:02:51.269 --> 02:02:57.212]  And yet, it is a crime for me to have these goats and to feed my children with them.
[02:02:57.212 --> 02:02:59.073]  And that's just an absolute shame.
[02:03:00.566 --> 02:03:02.707]  Terrible that we've gotten to this point.
[02:03:02.707 --> 02:03:14.134]  In California now, we also have the, you know, the SB 277 that's trying to tell us not only what we can feed our children, but what we can put in them, what we have to put in them as far as vaccines go.
[02:03:14.134 --> 02:03:17.236]  And it's getting to the point as a mother, like I said, I'm a new mom.
[02:03:17.236 --> 02:03:21.419]  I have a one and a half year old and I have, she's now almost three months old.
[02:03:23.238 --> 02:03:31.574]  I'm not happy with where our government is and it's only going to change if people like me and you and other people step up and say no.
[02:03:31.574 --> 02:03:32.276]  Sure.
[02:03:32.276 --> 02:03:33.318]  Who's not there with you?
[02:03:34.491 --> 02:03:35.832]  I was actually going to introduce her.
[02:03:35.832 --> 02:03:37.154]  This is Susan Walsh.
[02:03:37.154 --> 02:03:39.416]  She is, we're going to have a fangirl moment.
[02:03:39.416 --> 02:03:41.738]  We are both huge fans of you.
[02:03:41.738 --> 02:03:45.782]  So, uh, you wanted to turn me on for 30 minutes.
[02:03:45.782 --> 02:03:54.130]  I was like, you're going to be here and you're going to say hi because I mean, like what, eight years now, eight years now, she's listened to like every single show of yours.
[02:03:54.130 --> 02:03:55.591]  So we are actually huge fans.
[02:03:55.691 --> 02:03:59.732]  Well, I'm a fan of you guys, and I just want to say, seriously, you're the heroes.
[02:03:59.732 --> 02:04:01.253]  You're the ones taking action.
[02:04:01.253 --> 02:04:05.254]  So I'm definitely humbled by that, but just great job.
[02:04:05.254 --> 02:04:09.736]  And it just shows how by them attacking your freedom, it's exposing it.
[02:04:09.736 --> 02:04:13.137]  So people see that as a negative thing that you didn't win right away.
[02:04:13.137 --> 02:04:16.318]  You're winning by taking action.
[02:04:16.318 --> 02:04:18.178]  Yeah, that's what I actually told my husband, too.
[02:04:18.178 --> 02:04:19.859]  I mean, I firmly believe God puts
[02:04:20.632 --> 02:04:21.033]  That's good.
[02:04:34.432 --> 02:04:41.318]  Well listen, you guys probably have stuff you gotta go do, but if you want to hold for 25 minutes until Esalen's gone, I kind of talked over you and cut you short.
[02:04:41.318 --> 02:04:46.543]  I wanted to come back and get both your takes on where this fight's going globally and why you think they're doing this.
[02:04:46.543 --> 02:04:50.787]  We obviously know why, but if you can stay, hold for about 20 minutes.
[02:04:50.787 --> 02:04:52.549]  Daniel Esalen's coming on with breaking intel.
[02:04:52.549 --> 02:04:53.830]  We'll come back to you for some comments.
[02:04:54.250 --> 02:05:01.255]  The Pope has written an encyclical calling for a global political authority with power to save the environment.
[02:05:01.255 --> 02:05:06.959]  A Pope once came after Galileo for pointing out that the sun was the center of our solar system.
[02:05:06.959 --> 02:05:12.163]  Today, those who point out that the sun is the dominant factor in climate are vilified.
[02:05:12.743 --> 02:05:18.169]  The dogma of man-made global warming has been more of a religion than a science for a long time.
[02:05:18.169 --> 02:05:25.296]  James Lovelock, father of the Gaia hypothesis, pointedly said that environmentalism has, quote, become a religion, unquote.
[02:05:25.296 --> 02:05:33.324]  The outgoing head of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said climate change is, quote, my religion and dharma, unquote.
[02:05:33.704 --> 02:05:36.867]  The religion of environmentalism even has its own indulgences.
[02:05:36.867 --> 02:05:41.070]  You can pay for your sins against the environment with carbon credits.
[02:05:41.070 --> 02:05:46.294]  It was the abuse of indulgences by a former Pope that led to the Protestant Reformation.
[02:05:46.294 --> 02:05:51.337]  Today, we need a political and scientific reformation of the Church of Climatology.
[02:05:51.337 --> 02:05:53.219]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:05:53.559 --> 02:06:13.305]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[02:06:13.305 --> 02:06:17.727]  Well then, about six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.

[02:06:59.220 --> 02:07:10.366]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development.
[02:07:10.526 --> 02:07:13.927]  I'm concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.

[02:07:27.352 --> 02:07:31.054]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[02:07:31.054 --> 02:07:35.195]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[02:07:35.195 --> 02:07:39.057]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.

[02:08:03.296 --> 02:08:05.098]  We are on the march.
[02:08:05.098 --> 02:08:08.241]  The empire is on the run.
[02:08:08.241 --> 02:08:13.485]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:13.485 --> 02:08:15.627]  These headlines are coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:08:15.627 --> 02:08:23.333]  Then we're going to have our guest back on with the criminalization of micro-farming, gardens, goats, chickens in your backyard.
[02:08:23.333 --> 02:08:27.016]  How that's part of the agenda 21 to make us dependent.
[02:08:27.016 --> 02:08:27.417]  U.S.
[02:08:27.417 --> 02:08:29.899]  made position for war against Russia is the headline.
[02:08:29.899 --> 02:08:30.900]  It's already happening.
[02:08:31.943 --> 02:08:35.884]  Walmart has $76 billion in undisclosed overseas tax havens.
[02:08:35.884 --> 02:08:38.964]  Illegal alien rapists, child molesters freed in the U.S.
[02:08:38.964 --> 02:08:39.804]  instead of deported.
[02:08:39.804 --> 02:08:42.585]  Judicial watch, $36,000.
[02:08:42.585 --> 02:08:50.386]  But they're having a manhunt all over northern New York searching thousands of homes looking for two escaped convicts.
[02:08:50.386 --> 02:08:54.307]  It's just a Fourth Amendment power grab.
[02:08:54.307 --> 02:09:00.908]  Military veteran taken to court over city for his off-the-grid solar panels that aren't hooked into the grid.
[02:09:01.977 --> 02:09:06.202]  Boehner targets the Republicans that didn't vote for the TPP for retribution.

[02:09:35.370 --> 02:09:40.211]  How sexually confusing moths could save your clothes from holes.
[02:09:40.211 --> 02:09:41.351]  How does all that tie together?
[02:09:41.351 --> 02:09:43.551]  We're under massive engineering.
[02:09:43.551 --> 02:09:50.373]  Best-selling author and researcher, Daniel Estelin, is an amazing individual.
[02:09:51.622 --> 02:10:05.355]  And he's written the Bilderberg Club book, The True Story of the Bilderberg Group, that became the international bestseller in more than 30 countries, danielesteland.com, and he's got a new film out as well, or coming out.
[02:10:06.206 --> 02:10:10.992]  And of course, he got even more famous when Fidel Castro invited him to Cuba to talk about his book.
[02:10:10.992 --> 02:10:11.893]  That doesn't mean he's bad.
[02:10:11.893 --> 02:10:15.838]  If Fidel Castro invited me to go speak to him, I'd go say I disagree with communism, but I'd talk to him.
[02:10:15.838 --> 02:10:17.240]  It's just interesting.
[02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:20.064]  Daniel Esselstyn obviously had a big effect, is the point.
[02:10:20.064 --> 02:10:24.069]  And I happen to know of two of his sources in the Bilderberg.
[02:10:25.475 --> 02:10:28.297]  We have some of our sources that are on the edge of Bilderberg.
[02:10:28.297 --> 02:10:32.680]  A lot of what they say ends up in public statements, but kind of shaded.
[02:10:32.680 --> 02:10:38.624]  But he really has given us a lot of information over the years that two, three years later happens exactly as he said.
[02:10:38.624 --> 02:10:39.284]  Here's an example.
[02:10:39.284 --> 02:10:46.909]  He said they're going to implode the housing market in two years to consolidate power and to start a new bubble.
[02:10:46.909 --> 02:10:47.469]  He said that in 2006.
[02:10:47.469 --> 02:10:48.130]  It happened in 2008.
[02:10:51.215 --> 02:10:52.655]  Exactly as he said.
[02:10:52.655 --> 02:10:55.216]  That's because he's not looking into a crystal ball.
[02:10:55.216 --> 02:11:00.257]  The Bilderberg Group is at the very top of these globalist power structures.
[02:11:00.257 --> 02:11:16.741]  And so he joins us, in hindsight, to get into, from his sources, what was on the agenda this year and how things are going for them, what they think about the Euro being in trouble with the EU, crisis with Greece, England wanting to have a vote to get out
[02:11:18.695 --> 02:11:20.997]  They always said they couldn't survive exposure.
[02:11:20.997 --> 02:11:23.139]  Are they in trouble or are they stronger than ever?
[02:11:23.139 --> 02:11:25.401]  Daniel Estlin of danielestlin.com.
[02:11:25.401 --> 02:11:26.142]  Thank you for coming on.
[02:11:27.671 --> 02:11:29.291]  Alex, it's always a pleasure to be on your show.
[02:11:29.291 --> 02:11:30.312]  I always feel at home.
[02:11:30.312 --> 02:11:33.592]  I'm very welcome and it's great to be with you.
[02:11:33.592 --> 02:11:37.833]  And yes, indeed, I was at the Bilderberg Conference.
[02:11:37.833 --> 02:11:41.194]  I didn't make it too close to the actual event.
[02:11:41.194 --> 02:11:43.074]  We actually stayed in Innsbruck.
[02:11:43.074 --> 02:11:53.556]  Our sources on the inside, the same sources which extend of the original document from October 2014, telling us about the actual site of the meeting in June of this year.
[02:11:54.076 --> 02:11:54.416]  I think so.
[02:12:15.666 --> 02:12:16.187]  Well, thank you.
[02:12:16.187 --> 02:12:20.250]  Well, you've got some of the best sources out there, quite frankly, inside Bilderberg.
[02:12:20.250 --> 02:12:22.191]  We just have them on the edge of Bilderberg.
[02:12:22.191 --> 02:12:22.932]  How are things going for them?
[02:12:22.932 --> 02:12:23.452]  What's the mood?
[02:12:23.452 --> 02:12:24.533]  What was the theme?
[02:12:24.533 --> 02:12:25.794]  And what are they going to be pushing?
[02:12:42.955 --> 02:12:44.496]  Well, you know, I think they're very concerned.
[02:12:44.496 --> 02:12:56.259]  You have to say, if you're looking at the agenda this year, and also if you're looking at the actual list of the attendees, it was a, you know, pound for pound, I'd say, you know, it was certainly one of the stronger pound for pound lists over the last 10 years or so.
[02:12:56.259 --> 02:13:04.462]  There were lots of, you know, presidents and prime ministers from, you know, northern European countries, you know, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, that kind of stuff.
[02:13:04.462 --> 02:13:06.263]  And also some notable
[02:13:07.523 --> 02:13:07.924]  I think so.
[02:13:25.342 --> 02:13:26.403]  We're good to go.
[02:13:52.654 --> 02:13:52.834]  Thank you.
[02:14:08.476 --> 02:14:10.638]  What about the unprecedented security?
[02:14:10.638 --> 02:14:12.660]  I mean, I know that Tucker got shot at.
[02:14:12.660 --> 02:14:13.921]  You've had them try to kill you.
[02:14:13.921 --> 02:14:15.222]  We're not being dramatic.
[02:14:15.222 --> 02:14:16.443]  There's a reason you stay back.
[02:14:16.443 --> 02:14:20.547]  They really are scared of you because they know you've got some sources inside.
[02:14:20.547 --> 02:14:22.228]  They absolutely hate your guts.
[02:14:22.228 --> 02:14:23.709]  They raided Charlie Skelton.
[02:14:23.709 --> 02:14:26.952]  Our guys were threatened some.
[02:14:28.013 --> 02:14:33.516]  I've had my family death-threatened when I covered Bilderberg, when Hillary Clinton and Obama were there.
[02:14:33.516 --> 02:14:44.921]  They were actually listening to our phones and then calling up my wife, calling up family, and making threats and saying, we just listened to you and repeating it back to freak them out.
[02:14:44.921 --> 02:14:49.342]  That tended to be a particularly important one in 2008, you noted.
[02:14:49.342 --> 02:14:54.525]  This one seemed, just from me watching afar with our reporters, to be ultra-important.
[02:14:54.525 --> 02:14:57.086]  I've never seen them put a cordon back six miles, Daniel.
[02:14:58.493 --> 02:14:59.815]  Oh, you know, that's absolutely right.
[02:14:59.815 --> 02:15:11.427]  You know, one of the reasons, they actually, they started doing this back in 2007, the last year, where you had, you know, fairly easy access or close enough, you actually, you know, get them with a, you know, with a nice big long lens.
[02:15:11.427 --> 02:15:20.517]  Well, in 2006, when you came to Canada, to Canada, on the outskirts of Ottawa, before that, Jim and I were basically the only people going to these meetings, and when my book came out in the United States,
[02:15:20.917 --> 02:15:25.759]  And you know, everybody had a chance to see these photographs, which looked like it was taken, like, you know, literally from two meters away.
[02:15:25.759 --> 02:15:28.079]  Of course, they weren't, but it looked like it.
[02:15:28.079 --> 02:15:40.143]  These people realized that they need to do something with the security, and then, you know, with the onslaught of online media and, you know, social media, it just became impossible for these people, you know, to keep this information, you know, under way.
[02:15:40.143 --> 02:15:43.264]  So they started pushing this thing further and further back.
[02:15:43.264 --> 02:15:45.245]  And this year, you're absolutely right.
[02:15:45.245 --> 02:15:47.866]  You know, they certainly got a little bit, you know, out of hand in this sense.
[02:15:48.246 --> 02:16:04.597]  But also, what would really surprise me, especially what I saw back in October 2014, the document where, you know, the Interior Ministry basically telling all their people the vacation period for the month of June is off the charts because the Bilderbergers are coming to town.
[02:16:04.597 --> 02:16:07.379]  What surprised me is the fact that these people are actually having their meeting.
[02:16:07.919 --> 02:16:15.082]  Uh, in June because usually it's, you know, it could be late April at the earliest and usually sometime in May, May 15th, 20th.
[02:16:15.082 --> 02:16:19.663]  That's just about the time when you actually look at the agendas of the last 10, 20, 30 years.
[02:16:19.663 --> 02:16:22.024]  That's just about, you know, the right time for them to have the meeting.
[02:16:22.024 --> 02:16:26.926]  And the fact is that back in October, they knew that this year's meeting is going to be held in June.
[02:16:26.926 --> 02:16:35.369]  Told me that a lot of very important things are going to be happening in June because obviously, you know, if they hold the meeting in May and then stuff happens in June, it certainly doesn't make any sense.
[02:16:35.369 --> 02:16:36.629]  And the first thing that obviously happened,
[02:16:36.889 --> 02:16:37.470]  We're good to go.
[02:16:56.184 --> 02:16:59.925]  Yeah, try saying that ten times, okay?
[02:16:59.925 --> 02:17:13.450]  And they have to make a, you know, small-ish payment of 500 million euros, you know, as a result of what basically happened when the Swiss de-pegged the franc and, you know, revalued their currency, like, you know, 30% in ten minutes.
[02:17:13.450 --> 02:17:15.650]  And so that's one of the things that happened.
[02:17:15.650 --> 02:17:23.633]  The southern province of Carinthia, you know, backed away from, you know, pledges previously made by saying that we simply can't pay the money of the monies that we owe.
[02:17:24.215 --> 02:17:26.889]  And, you know, an important understanding is how all of these banks
[02:17:27.933 --> 02:17:30.374]  Basically own each other's debt.
[02:17:30.374 --> 02:17:40.379]  In other words, the cross-ownership, quote-unquote, of debt means that when one goes down, it will, you know, basically provoke a chain reaction of all the other banks going down.
[02:17:40.379 --> 02:17:49.403]  And while this isn't, you know, a huge trigger, this IPO, Alpi, Adria, you know, it's a little bank, the fact is that all of Eastern Europe can and will be affected.
[02:17:49.403 --> 02:17:54.045]  And, you know, but what originally was from, you know, the Swiss de-banking the franc from the Euro,
[02:17:54.585 --> 02:18:00.287]  You know, with a system as illiquid as it is today, there's no telling how far, you know, this thing could reverberate.
[02:18:00.287 --> 02:18:14.834]  And, of course, you have Greece, which just recently missed the June the 5th deadline, you know, for the payment, which was 320 billion euros, the money they simply don't have, and they said, you know, we're not going to print it, and we can't, you know, we're not going to pay it, and we certainly can't print it.
[02:18:14.834 --> 02:18:19.376]  And so the only thing that's left is for them to default and fall into the old parameters of Russia and China.
[02:18:19.376 --> 02:18:22.497]  You know, yesterday, the day before, right after the Bilderberg meeting finished,
[02:18:22.998 --> 02:18:28.426]  All of the European newspapers, in Italy, in France, in Germany, in Spain, they all basically said the same thing.
[02:18:28.426 --> 02:18:31.571]  If Greece, you know, gets out of the Euro, and...
[02:18:32.933 --> 02:18:33.594]  We're good to go.
[02:19:02.822 --> 02:19:04.063]  You know, playing itself out.
[02:19:04.063 --> 02:19:11.869]  You can, you know, talk about Ukraine, International Monetary Fund thing to, you know, restructure $10 billion worth of, you know, war funds.
[02:19:11.869 --> 02:19:13.570]  That's fascinating.
[02:19:13.570 --> 02:19:14.951]  You know, and that kind of stuff.
[02:19:14.951 --> 02:19:19.374]  Not to mention something else, which was very, very interesting, and again... Well, hold on, Daniel.
[02:19:19.374 --> 02:19:20.855]  We've got to go to break.
[02:19:20.855 --> 02:19:24.718]  When we come back, I want to get into that next point you were about to hit, and I want to ask you this other question.
[02:19:24.718 --> 02:19:28.121]  You mentioned the banks and the corruption of who was there.
[02:19:28.121 --> 02:19:28.701]  HSBC,
[02:19:30.282 --> 02:19:35.728]  With all these admissions of fixing rates and laundering money.
[02:19:35.728 --> 02:19:44.918]  You have the heads of HSBC, three of them there, top people, with the regulators from the EU and the Exchequer head, which regulates it in the UK.
[02:19:44.918 --> 02:19:48.762]  I mean, that right there is so illegal, so flagrant.
[02:19:48.762 --> 02:19:50.064]  They seem to be so bold.
[02:19:50.064 --> 02:19:52.086]  We'll talk about that with Daniel Estill and straight ahead.
[02:19:54.918 --> 02:20:02.200]  If you're worried about your health, and you're tired of the nasty side effects of harsh drugs or antibiotics, then look no further.

[02:21:54.131 --> 02:22:00.873]  Usually, the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[02:22:00.873 --> 02:22:05.274]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[02:22:05.274 --> 02:22:08.775]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[02:22:08.775 --> 02:22:09.915]  Not fun!
[02:22:09.915 --> 02:22:18.298]  However, if you could consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.

[02:22:36.527 --> 02:22:42.831]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.

[02:24:04.965 --> 02:24:07.186]  Final segment with Daniel Esselin coming up.
[02:24:07.186 --> 02:24:08.726]  We'll finish up with the war.
[02:24:10.101 --> 02:24:15.690]  On being self-sufficient, solar power, chickens in your backyard, we'll briefly talk about that with our guests at the end of the last hour.
[02:24:15.690 --> 02:24:18.794]  I wanted to have them back up to finish fighting out in California.
[02:24:18.794 --> 02:24:23.161]  And then Greeks refuse to pay debt, declared illegal, illegitimate, and quote, odious.
[02:24:24.224 --> 02:24:26.526]  Other nations set to follow suit.
[02:24:26.526 --> 02:24:28.627]  That's some of the news up on InfoWars.com.
[02:24:28.627 --> 02:24:32.210]  Customer claims KFC served him fried rat.
[02:24:32.210 --> 02:24:35.953]  Well, that's going to be healthier than the chicken soaked in MSG.
[02:24:35.953 --> 02:24:37.614]  So you ought to be happy.
[02:24:37.614 --> 02:24:38.655]  Privacy expert.
[02:24:38.655 --> 02:24:42.798]  Time-traveling robots could punish future crime.
[02:24:42.798 --> 02:24:46.120]  Daniel, how is their agenda going, of course?
[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:50.884]  And when you got cut off from the break, you were trying to get into something you were saying that was really, really important.
[02:24:50.884 --> 02:24:51.184]  Go ahead.
[02:24:52.761 --> 02:24:58.945]  It's a very interesting point when you kind of look at the stuff from a bird's eye view and you see how these things kind of work together.
[02:24:58.945 --> 02:25:07.152]  For example, just a few days before the Bilderberg conference, Russian government, via Russian newspaper Pravda,
[02:25:07.592 --> 02:25:08.412]  We're good to go.
[02:25:34.358 --> 02:25:35.339]  We're good to go.
[02:25:55.101 --> 02:26:01.286]  And so when you kind of look at this whole thing, you know, gold is a financial thermonuclear weapon.
[02:26:01.286 --> 02:26:04.568]  I mean, you've been talking about gold deposits for a very, very long time.
[02:26:04.568 --> 02:26:09.752]  And now this is the kind of stuff that can actually destroy the fiat currency system of the West.
[02:26:09.752 --> 02:26:18.739]  And, you know, it wouldn't surprise, I think, anyone who really understands how things work, you know, if Washington was giving the courtesy, so to speak, of a heads up, you know, to some sort of
[02:26:19.446 --> 02:26:19.686]  Sure.
[02:26:19.686 --> 02:26:22.408]  Sure, we've seen them manipulating that with tungsten and naked shorting.
[02:26:22.408 --> 02:26:26.151]  What does it signify in Spain that they're talking about restricting sales of gold?
[02:26:26.151 --> 02:26:30.234]  I mean that's got to show you that they're really worried about gold.
[02:26:49.921 --> 02:26:55.806]  Well, what it basically tells you is that the whole thing is done.
[02:26:55.806 --> 02:27:04.692]  If you look at what's actually going on in Europe over the last few days, France, Germany, Austria, Italy, they have closed down their borders, Alex.
[02:27:04.692 --> 02:27:10.317]  This whole Schengen Treaty in Europe, which basically created this one, united, borderless Europe, that's dead.
[02:27:10.837 --> 02:27:18.002]  You have tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of immigrants coming into Italy, tens of thousands that are coming into France.
[02:27:18.002 --> 02:27:22.885]  You know, you have about 50, 60,000 over the last few months have entered Germany.
[02:27:22.885 --> 02:27:25.367]  And so the European nations are saying, we've had enough.
[02:27:25.367 --> 02:27:32.231]  As the European Central Authority, which is the European Parliament, the European Union, they have completely lost control and are losing power.
[02:27:32.231 --> 02:27:38.075]  And this is one of the reasons why we're seeing some of these, you know, shakeups on the European supranational level.
[02:27:38.075 --> 02:27:39.456]  And I will go to show you that.
[02:27:40.617 --> 02:27:46.240]  So their borders are going back up, which signifies the Euro is beginning to break up, which I know the Globalists plan to build it.
[02:28:09.756 --> 02:28:16.801]  Then suck everybody dry, then implode it, but have it fold into a new supernational global government as the bubble.
[02:28:16.801 --> 02:28:20.263]  Is it going according to plan, or is it gyrating out of control?
[02:28:20.263 --> 02:28:21.324]  Is globalism in trouble?
[02:28:22.637 --> 02:28:31.019]  And globalism is in trouble because, you know, for the first time, and I know we've talked about this last year and the year before, you know, to what point are these people controlling, you know, the financial meltdown?
[02:28:31.019 --> 02:28:51.224]  Well, I can tell you this, you know, they're controlling it, but they're not controlling it as they would have, you know, liked to have controlled it, because one of the strong sentiments amongst the Bilderbergers this year is that the United States dollar may not survive, and so what they're simply doing is they're cashing out, and you see this cashing out process on the world stage, and, you know, as the year winds down over the last, you know, six months of the year,
[02:28:51.824 --> 02:29:00.434]  It's going to be a very messy, very chaotic, and very important period in the minds of the current economic situation.
[02:29:00.434 --> 02:29:09.886]  If you kind of go back over the past, I don't know, 40, 50 years or so, every seven years there's some kind of a thing going on which makes you wonder what's going on in the world.
[02:29:11.826 --> 02:29:12.827]  We're set for another one.
[02:29:32.310 --> 02:29:37.952]  Exactly, and the year 2015 will be known for the United States... I'll tell you what, Daniel.
[02:29:37.952 --> 02:29:38.972]  Do five more minutes with us.
[02:29:38.972 --> 02:29:40.672]  You've got to finish with this bombshell info.
[02:29:40.672 --> 02:29:42.193]  Then we're going to get another guest on.
[02:29:42.193 --> 02:29:43.473]  This is huge.
[02:29:43.473 --> 02:29:44.873]  We're on the march.
[02:29:44.873 --> 02:29:46.474]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:46.474 --> 02:29:50.075]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:55.427 --> 02:29:56.189]  Fast track?
[02:29:56.189 --> 02:29:57.271]  It's not done.
[02:29:57.271 --> 02:30:05.568]  Outright lies about job creation are now giving way to discussions on how to pay for temporary unemployment benefits for those whose jobs will be exported.
[02:30:06.258 --> 02:30:08.540]  At first they were going to take the money out of Medicare.
[02:30:08.540 --> 02:30:16.086]  Now it looks like they will try to raise fines on small business to pay workers that multinational corporations will fire.
[02:30:16.086 --> 02:30:17.707]  It's not Obama trade.
[02:30:17.707 --> 02:30:19.569]  It's Monsanto trade.
[02:30:19.569 --> 02:30:20.710]  Merck trade.
[02:30:20.710 --> 02:30:22.731]  Goldman Sachs trade.
[02:30:22.731 --> 02:30:24.153]  It's not free trade.
[02:30:24.153 --> 02:30:31.839]  It's traders in Congress trying to pass a secret treaty by subterfuge and subverting the constitutional process for treaty ratification.
[02:30:32.483 --> 02:30:43.286]  The rich get richer as multinational corporations consolidate their ownership of everything, especially their ownership of the leaders of both parties.
[02:30:43.286 --> 02:30:44.487]  Educate your friends.
[02:30:44.487 --> 02:30:45.867]  Educate your families.
[02:30:45.867 --> 02:30:47.868]  Stop this before it's too late.

[02:33:05.558 --> 02:33:09.901]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:33:09.901 --> 02:33:20.069]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:20.069 --> 02:33:23.832]  We've had rabbis on talking about the seven-year Shemitah.
[02:33:23.832 --> 02:33:28.896]  We've had the former head of policy, Department of the Treasury, talking about cycles.
[02:33:28.896 --> 02:33:31.017]  We've had Mr. Dent on.
[02:33:31.017 --> 02:33:33.940]  We've had just countless economist experts on.
[02:33:35.493 --> 02:33:45.962]  All saying that a massive, massive meltdown is coming, much bigger than 2008.
[02:33:45.962 --> 02:33:52.508]  And now, it's in the news today, the next great European financial crisis has begun!
[02:33:52.508 --> 02:33:58.894]  Business Insider, Greeks are stashing tens of thousands of bundles of Euros in their homes.
[02:34:00.242 --> 02:34:02.583]  Ahead of a bank bail-in when they grab your bank account.
[02:34:02.583 --> 02:34:07.925]  UK draws up contingency plans as Bank of Greece warns of uncontrollable crisis.
[02:34:07.925 --> 02:34:09.866]  I mean, this is big.
[02:34:09.866 --> 02:34:11.667]  London Guardian, it's going to be bad.
[02:34:11.667 --> 02:34:18.050]  Whatever happens, Greece on the edge of Eurozone exit looms.
[02:34:18.050 --> 02:34:25.393]  And then you've got the banks all admitting that they're fixing the interest rates, money laundering, manipulating currencies, manipulating stock markets.
[02:34:26.249 --> 02:34:38.279]  I was talking to a very successful hedge fund manager who got bought out a few years ago, but it was a major company, billions of dollars off record.
[02:34:38.279 --> 02:34:42.323]  Ran into him and looked up who he was, and sure enough he was who he said he was.
[02:34:42.323 --> 02:34:49.789]  Pretty famous guy, I'd seen him on TV and stuff, and we were in a restaurant and he came over and talked to me for about 10 minutes, tried to buy me a drink and stuff.
[02:34:51.960 --> 02:34:54.862]  And I'm detoxing, so, you know, it's none of that.
[02:34:54.862 --> 02:34:57.043]  And he was just scared.
[02:34:57.043 --> 02:35:01.326]  And I told you about billionaires five years ago that I talked to who were leaving to New Zealand.
[02:35:01.326 --> 02:35:03.988]  I told you James Cameron really left because he's scared.
[02:35:03.988 --> 02:35:05.008]  Now that's admitted.
[02:35:05.008 --> 02:35:06.009]  But I didn't just say that.
[02:35:06.009 --> 02:35:07.410]  I knew somebody that knows him well.
[02:35:09.252 --> 02:35:10.573]  And Daniel Esslin's on with us.
[02:35:10.573 --> 02:35:11.334]  I know he's for real.
[02:35:11.334 --> 02:35:12.174]  I know his sources.
[02:35:12.174 --> 02:35:14.256]  And he's saying it's the seven-year cycle.
[02:35:14.256 --> 02:35:15.317]  Is it artificial?
[02:35:15.317 --> 02:35:16.337]  Is it there?
[02:35:16.337 --> 02:35:20.781]  Get to where you say this is going because all the experts, we have the experts on that are right.
[02:35:20.781 --> 02:35:21.721]  That's what we have you on.
[02:35:21.721 --> 02:35:23.002]  We appreciate you coming on.
[02:35:23.002 --> 02:35:27.386]  DanielEsslin.com, bestselling author, jointist, researcher, Bilderberg investigative journalist.
[02:35:28.166 --> 02:35:31.730]  But it seems like this new bubble is so much bigger than the others.
[02:35:31.730 --> 02:35:34.193]  Am I right in saying this could be spectacular?
[02:35:34.193 --> 02:35:35.455]  And how bad could it be?
[02:35:35.455 --> 02:35:38.298]  I know you've got to go, Daniel, so five minutes.
[02:35:38.298 --> 02:35:39.680]  What else do you want to impart to folks?
[02:35:40.951 --> 02:35:45.515]  Well, you know, it could be spectacular in the sense that you have gold right now at $1,200 or $1,300 an ounce.
[02:35:45.515 --> 02:35:51.499]  Well, it could very well go to about $50,000 or $60,000 an ounce very short, and it's not me saying it.
[02:35:51.499 --> 02:35:55.543]  Bloomberg came out and said that, you know, shortly just before the Bilderberg conference.
[02:35:55.543 --> 02:36:02.208]  So I know this was on the agenda, and we were talking about, you know, the dollar collapsing, and Bilderbergers understand this, and they're cashing out.
[02:36:02.208 --> 02:36:08.213]  Or if Bloomberg, which is Bilderberg and mainstream, they're talking about this thing actually going to $50,000, $60,000 an ounce.
[02:36:10.314 --> 02:36:10.795]  We're good to go.
[02:36:27.768 --> 02:36:27.948]  Wow.
[02:36:47.186 --> 02:36:47.827]  Obviously not.
[02:37:17.468 --> 02:37:20.236]  You know, start building your know art now.
[02:37:20.236 --> 02:37:21.761]  You still have a little bit of time left.
[02:37:24.212 --> 02:37:30.436]  Well, I tell you, Daniel Estlin, you look at the provocative moves against Russia.
[02:37:30.436 --> 02:37:34.639]  China's engaged in some of their own provocative moves, but the West has as well.
[02:37:34.639 --> 02:37:36.541]  I'd say that's 50-50 blame.
[02:37:36.541 --> 02:37:38.302]  But I look at the Western establishment.
[02:37:38.302 --> 02:37:40.704]  Our elites have never acted this reckless.
[02:37:40.704 --> 02:37:41.684]  I've never been to Russia.
[02:37:41.684 --> 02:37:43.145]  I don't have a dog in the fight.
[02:37:43.145 --> 02:37:46.628]  But I don't want to start fights with people, and I can't see geopolitically
[02:37:47.915 --> 02:37:54.939]  How destabilizing Poland, Ukraine, and the Caucasus helps the Euro, the West, anybody.
[02:37:54.939 --> 02:38:00.123]  I mean, we are truly, our elites in our name are cut and dry bad guys.
[02:38:00.123 --> 02:38:03.184]  There's really no way to change that.
[02:38:03.184 --> 02:38:10.429]  Russia is now allied with Egypt, allied with Greece, allied... China was bigger enemies with them than us.
[02:38:10.429 --> 02:38:13.951]  They're now buddy-buddy.
[02:38:13.951 --> 02:38:16.753]  The globalists have taken America's soft power and
[02:38:18.112 --> 02:38:18.792]  S.H.
[02:38:18.792 --> 02:38:21.813]  you-know-what-it-it-away, down the toilet.
[02:38:21.813 --> 02:38:24.714]  Our elites are super smart, as you know.
[02:38:24.714 --> 02:38:26.775]  There's got to be some larger plan.
[02:38:26.775 --> 02:38:32.997]  Why would they be destroying our name, risking World War III, and acting so crazy?
[02:38:32.997 --> 02:38:36.378]  Or is it megalomania, like Napoleon and Hitler got?
[02:38:36.378 --> 02:38:38.138]  Do they really think they're invincible?
[02:38:38.138 --> 02:38:46.361]  Do they have an ace in the hole, or a bevy of aces, a stable of aces, an arsenal of aces that we don't know about?
[02:38:47.887 --> 02:38:48.487]  I don't think so.
[02:38:48.487 --> 02:38:51.068]  I think the question is, it's the British Empire.
[02:38:51.068 --> 02:38:52.988]  And what basically happens is that they're going down.
[02:38:52.988 --> 02:38:54.648]  The economic cycle is going down.
[02:38:54.648 --> 02:39:00.150]  The system itself is putrid and that's about to be blown out.
[02:39:00.150 --> 02:39:02.910]  And so they're willing to destroy the entire world in order to save themselves.
[02:39:02.910 --> 02:39:04.691]  Of course, they're also going to go down.
[02:39:04.691 --> 02:39:06.971]  There are a lot of unknowns right now.
[02:39:06.971 --> 02:39:11.652]  And the only thing we do know is that if this thing gets started anywhere in the world, it's going to get really, really bad.
[02:39:11.992 --> 02:39:22.595]  And you're talking about nuclear nations, not just the United States, you know, projecting its weakness here or there against a weaker opponent, be it Iraq or Afghanistan or, you know, Grenada.
[02:39:22.595 --> 02:39:27.197]  No, we're talking about China, we're talking about Russia, we're talking about India, Pakistan, North Korea.
[02:39:27.197 --> 02:39:31.878]  And if we get into this shooting war with these kinds of things, the odds are it's going to go nuclear.
[02:39:31.878 --> 02:39:33.899]  If it goes nuclear, we're all going to hell.
[02:39:33.899 --> 02:39:37.840]  Well, Mark, I've seen a video where 80% of the people, uh-oh.
[02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:42.882]  Eight out of ten people said, let's nuke Russia so we're superior.
[02:39:42.882 --> 02:39:44.923]  They went and talked to Russians, did the same thing.
[02:39:44.923 --> 02:39:46.724]  They all freaked out and said, what are you crazy?
[02:39:46.724 --> 02:39:49.266]  And almost attacked the cameraman.
[02:39:49.266 --> 02:39:52.107]  Because that's a sane response to insanity.
[02:39:52.107 --> 02:39:54.129]  And I'm not glorifying the Russians.
[02:39:54.129 --> 02:40:01.733]  But what happened to Americans, especially so-called liberals, that they're in this trance because they think the word liberal lets them act like fascists.
[02:40:02.313 --> 02:40:04.976]  What happened to the Republican Party trying to sign the TPP?
[02:40:04.976 --> 02:40:10.922]  I mean, there really is a collective insanity in the West right now.
[02:40:10.922 --> 02:40:17.670]  You know, basically, Alex, like, you know, in the United States, the top two areas where the government is spending most of its money, the first is obvious, it's military.
[02:40:17.670 --> 02:40:18.631]  But you know what the second is?
[02:40:19.497 --> 02:40:20.659]  That's tens of billions a month?
[02:40:39.841 --> 02:40:42.424]  Sure, but they're using high-tech brainwashing to pacify the public.
[02:40:57.714 --> 02:41:01.197]  They're using every way possible to pacify the public, you know?
[02:41:01.197 --> 02:41:19.233]  There's a lot of games being played, and if you kind of look at what's going on in America itself, there's a lot of not only race wars, but there's a lot of fighting between, you know, groups of people and races, blacks and whites, men against women, you know, you have Indians against the Pakistanis, you know, you have the Arabs against the blacks.
[02:41:20.234 --> 02:41:34.162]  And all of this kind of stuff, you know, the police against everybody else, all this kind of stuff is, I have no doubt at all, is orchestrated from behind the scenes because while you're fighting each other, you don't keep your eye on the bigger prize, which is, you know, survival of the planet itself at the cost of these supernational organizations.
[02:41:34.162 --> 02:41:41.386]  Sure, so bottom line, the world government is being built, the Pope's out there endorsing it, but at the cost of the planet itself.
[02:41:41.386 --> 02:41:44.908]  I mean, they may get world government for about a minute and then blow it up.
[02:41:46.943 --> 02:41:47.903]  It certainly doesn't look good.
[02:41:47.903 --> 02:41:54.865]  It's a very, very, very scary situation, especially as you don't have, you know, the politicians that we had in the world in the 60s and the 50s.
[02:41:54.865 --> 02:42:02.648]  Well, actually, even the Bilderbergers who built Bilderberg, you know, in 1954 and the early 1960s, the people who came out of the, you know, early, late 19th century or 20th century,
[02:42:04.309 --> 02:42:05.390]  They're not there anymore.
[02:42:05.390 --> 02:42:07.312]  Now we have the people who are running the show.
[02:42:07.312 --> 02:42:10.296]  You have, you know, the crazy kooks who were born after the Second World War.
[02:42:10.296 --> 02:42:11.457]  You know, the baby boomers.
[02:42:11.457 --> 02:42:20.528]  And they certainly don't have the gravitas of, you know, the Rockefellers and the Jacksons and the Prince Bernards and, you know, and these individuals who actually put Bilderberg on the map.
[02:42:20.988 --> 02:42:21.509]  We're good to go.
[02:42:44.369 --> 02:42:45.930]  Well, sure, that was my final question.
[02:42:45.930 --> 02:42:47.210]  DanielLesteland.com.
[02:42:47.210 --> 02:42:49.011]  I can't wait to get you on your new film.
[02:42:49.011 --> 02:42:50.632]  Four or five years of the making comes out.
[02:42:50.632 --> 02:42:54.353]  I've seen some of the cinematography, the trailer, truly amazing.
[02:42:54.353 --> 02:42:59.315]  David Rockefeller did just turn 100 on June 12th.
[02:42:59.315 --> 02:43:00.215]  I didn't even know that.
[02:43:00.215 --> 02:43:05.057]  It just seems like yesterday he was 94 and put out memoirs.
[02:43:05.057 --> 02:43:06.758]  I'm told David Rockefeller has faded.
[02:43:06.758 --> 02:43:09.999]  That's why Senator Rockefeller retired to take over the reins.
[02:43:09.999 --> 02:43:12.080]  For those who don't know, David Rockefeller has been there
[02:43:12.620 --> 02:43:17.423]  Since his father set up the UN and the entire global government infrastructure.
[02:43:17.423 --> 02:43:22.166]  I mean, is anybody in modern world history more important than David Rockefeller?
[02:43:22.166 --> 02:43:24.968]  And what's the word on him?
[02:43:24.968 --> 02:43:27.089]  Well, you know, he's completely out of the picture.
[02:43:27.089 --> 02:43:27.389]  He's 100.
[02:43:27.389 --> 02:43:30.551]  So, you know, I don't think he's all together intellectually.
[02:43:30.551 --> 02:43:31.332]  He can't be all together.
[02:43:31.332 --> 02:43:36.175]  Certainly Gaga is, you know, I don't think he'll be going to any public meetings.
[02:43:36.175 --> 02:43:39.837]  I don't think we'll be seeing very much of him because of this kind of, you know, this advantage.
[02:43:40.257 --> 02:43:41.058]  They're in a bubble!
[02:43:41.058 --> 02:43:41.558]  They're in a bubble!
[02:44:06.912 --> 02:44:07.512]  They're in a bubble.
[02:44:07.512 --> 02:44:08.453]  They're smoking their own dope.
[02:44:08.453 --> 02:44:09.254]  Exactly, Alex.
[02:44:09.254 --> 02:44:23.744]  They're in a bubble and that means that, you know, this is going to come to time not too long from now, if you're still around, that Bill O'Brien is going to be completely, you know, irrelevant simply because the people who are there, they simply don't understand how the world works beyond, you know, the four walls that they operate within.
[02:44:24.773 --> 02:44:25.353]  Amazing.
[02:44:25.353 --> 02:44:27.074]  Well, when is your film coming out?
[02:44:27.074 --> 02:44:28.375]  I mean, I've seen clips of it.
[02:44:28.375 --> 02:44:29.135]  The film is done.
[02:44:29.135 --> 02:44:34.197]  Yeah, we just needed to put this last little bit of the Bilderberg meeting itself into the film, and it's finished.
[02:44:34.197 --> 02:44:37.419]  And we're going to be premiering in the United States in September.
[02:44:37.419 --> 02:44:38.960]  Well, I want to get you on then.
[02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:41.221]  Anytime you want to come on, we'd love to have you.
[02:44:41.221 --> 02:44:42.221]  Thank you, Daniel Esselstyn.
[02:44:42.221 --> 02:44:43.082]  Amazing information.
[02:44:43.082 --> 02:44:43.882]  Thank you.
[02:44:43.882 --> 02:44:44.222]  Sure.
[02:44:44.222 --> 02:44:45.603]  That is a true... Thank you, sir.
[02:44:45.603 --> 02:44:48.104]  That's a true investigative journalist right there of the highest caliber.
[02:44:50.213 --> 02:44:51.394]  Man, that's what I mean.
[02:44:51.394 --> 02:44:53.335]  I don't want to fight with the cops.
[02:44:53.335 --> 02:44:55.277]  I don't want to fight with the FBI.
[02:44:55.277 --> 02:44:57.298]  I don't want to fight with the ADL.
[02:44:57.298 --> 02:44:59.399]  I don't want to fight with the Muslims.
[02:44:59.399 --> 02:45:03.262]  I don't want to fight with the Black Panthers.
[02:45:03.262 --> 02:45:05.744]  I just don't want to nuke the planet.
[02:45:05.744 --> 02:45:09.466]  I don't want to inject little girls with Gardasil that sterilizes them on record.
[02:45:09.466 --> 02:45:13.469]  I mean, you know, I don't want to take a microchip.
[02:45:13.469 --> 02:45:17.612]  What type of government doesn't want you having a garden?
[02:45:17.612 --> 02:45:18.773]  People that want you to live in a prison.
[02:45:22.190 --> 02:45:27.092]  And man, tyranny is just putting its foot down right now, but the good news is people are squirming.
[02:45:27.092 --> 02:45:28.132]  I wanted to finish up with him.
[02:45:28.132 --> 02:45:37.636]  I appreciate him holding for 40 minutes, and we usually hold a guest over to finish him, but I couldn't have Daniel wait because she's fighting hard and she's got her friend there with her.
[02:45:37.636 --> 02:45:40.817]  I forgot her name, but we've got Ms.
[02:45:40.817 --> 02:45:44.038]  Freeman joining us from I'mProGoat.com.
[02:45:47.521 --> 02:45:49.343]  She again is being persecuted.
[02:45:49.343 --> 02:45:51.305]  Her husband's in the military.
[02:45:51.305 --> 02:45:56.351]  She had her breast tissue removed when she was, I guess, 19 because of a genetic condition.
[02:45:56.351 --> 02:46:00.615]  Goat milk is one of the best milks out there.
[02:46:00.615 --> 02:46:02.017]  She's out in a town in California.
[02:46:02.017 --> 02:46:04.059]  And I wanted to get some comments from your friend as well.
[02:46:04.059 --> 02:46:05.140]  You're both listeners.
[02:46:05.140 --> 02:46:06.602]  Really proud of the fact that so many times
[02:46:07.262 --> 02:46:09.603]  I don't want to sound arrogant, but I asked folks on there, are you a listener?
[02:46:09.603 --> 02:46:11.484]  And it turns out they are.
[02:46:11.484 --> 02:46:15.206]  Even members of Congress that have woken up turn out to be listeners.
[02:46:15.206 --> 02:46:16.747]  But it's not just this, you know, me.
[02:46:16.747 --> 02:46:17.907]  It's all the guests we have on.
[02:46:17.907 --> 02:46:19.208]  It's what we do on this show.
[02:46:19.208 --> 02:46:27.992]  But other points that you needed to make about the fight to be able to be self-sufficient?
[02:46:27.992 --> 02:46:28.252]  Hey there!
[02:46:28.252 --> 02:46:30.633]  Sorry, I disconnected.
[02:46:30.633 --> 02:46:31.234]  Oh, it's okay.
[02:46:31.234 --> 02:46:36.156]  Any other points that you got cut off because the hour ended that you didn't get to finish, then we can put your friend on, any comments she's got.
[02:46:37.185 --> 02:46:38.686]  Yes, yes.
[02:46:38.686 --> 02:46:41.509]  Basically, I have my little notes here, forgive me.
[02:46:41.509 --> 02:46:48.194]  I do want to thank, while this is going on, and I don't have my goats, the community has really, really stepped up.
[02:46:48.194 --> 02:46:51.798]  I have a lot of local moms that are actually donating breast milk to my children.
[02:46:52.478 --> 02:46:57.782]  So, as of right now, I've been able to kick them off a formula, which is really fantastic.
[02:46:57.782 --> 02:46:59.123]  However, we are fighting.
[02:46:59.123 --> 02:47:10.772]  I mean, my husband and I want to have more children, so I am fighting right now to... Well, that's what cutting the resources off is about, taxing you so high that you can't afford to have kids.
[02:47:10.772 --> 02:47:12.013]  Pretty much, basically.
[02:47:12.013 --> 02:47:14.015]  Population control at its finest right there.
[02:47:15.081 --> 02:47:21.266]  So, basically, I also want to kind of do a shout-out to the Info Warriors.
[02:47:21.266 --> 02:47:32.274]  I'm already getting some donations coming in, and one of the donations from Lonnie posted the quote that all of this is necessary for evil triumph is for good men to do nothing.
[02:47:32.274 --> 02:47:39.299]  That's actually my husband and I, that's our favorite quote as far as political activism and community activism goes.
[02:47:39.299 --> 02:47:40.920]  A lot of people, me personally,
[02:47:41.580 --> 02:47:45.463]  I, like I said, I'm a fan of InfoWars, I'm a fan of NaturalNews.com.
[02:47:45.463 --> 02:47:50.587]  I always read these stories and I always think, it's not going to happen to me.
[02:47:50.587 --> 02:48:01.274]  You look at it separate, you look at it as a different, almost like you're watching a story unfold, like a sci-fi story of this government grown out of control and taking away property rights.
[02:48:02.011 --> 02:48:04.434]  But the fact is, we're there right now.
[02:48:04.434 --> 02:48:05.736]  And it did happen to me.
[02:48:05.736 --> 02:48:11.562]  I did not expect to be sitting where I am right now sharing my story with you and saying, see, look, the government's out of control.
[02:48:11.562 --> 02:48:13.705]  They're infringing on property rights.
[02:48:13.705 --> 02:48:14.806]  It's happening.
[02:48:14.806 --> 02:48:16.368]  It's happening now.
[02:48:16.368 --> 02:48:17.369]  And it's coming to you.
[02:48:17.369 --> 02:48:19.933]  If it hasn't come to you yet, it is coming to you.
[02:48:20.814 --> 02:48:25.357]  So, um, I am very, very grateful for what you're doing, Alex.
[02:48:25.357 --> 02:48:26.438]  Oh, please don't thank me anymore.
[02:48:26.438 --> 02:48:30.041]  I just wanted you to be able to talk about where you go next, where the fight goes.
[02:48:30.041 --> 02:48:32.823]  And then, um, I wanted to see if your friend had anything she wanted to say.
[02:48:32.823 --> 02:48:33.583]  What was her name again?
[02:48:33.583 --> 02:48:34.984]  Susan.
[02:48:34.984 --> 02:48:36.445]  You know, let me tap the phone off of her.
[02:48:36.445 --> 02:48:40.808]  Yeah, Susan, spend a few minutes telling us about this fight and where it's going from there.
[02:48:40.808 --> 02:48:44.931]  Because, again, if they can shut off our resources, we're captured.
[02:48:44.931 --> 02:48:46.833]  So, Susan, what's your take on this situation?
[02:48:47.671 --> 02:48:49.452]  Susan, what's your take on it?
[02:48:49.452 --> 02:48:52.654]  Hi Alex, I'd just like to say thank you first and foremost.
[02:48:52.654 --> 02:48:54.956]  You are like one of my most admired people.
[02:48:54.956 --> 02:48:56.217]  Please don't thank me.
[02:48:56.217 --> 02:48:57.558]  Stop it.
[02:48:57.558 --> 02:48:59.059]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[02:48:59.059 --> 02:49:03.562]  But if I had ten people to have dinner with, you'd be one of those ten, just so you know.
[02:49:03.562 --> 02:49:04.383]  Well, you're a sweetheart.
[02:49:04.383 --> 02:49:04.663]  Thank you.
[02:49:05.523 --> 02:49:14.109]  Yeah, so I never met Gingy Freeman prior to this, and when I read about this going down in our city, I thought, she needs help.
[02:49:14.109 --> 02:49:17.531]  You know, anything that I could possibly do to help her with this cause.
[02:49:17.531 --> 02:49:26.778]  I mean, I look at this as a human rights issue, and I'm just so infuriated, and, you know, I want to see this thing through to the end regardless.
[02:49:26.778 --> 02:49:28.919]  And so we're not going away.
[02:49:28.919 --> 02:49:32.442]  We're actually gaining more and more, you know, visibility in the community.
[02:49:33.012 --> 02:49:39.919]  And we're going to be a serious force, and you know, it wasn't until this issue that I stepped up and said, you know what?
[02:49:39.919 --> 02:49:40.860]  I'm in, 100%.
[02:49:40.860 --> 02:49:53.653]  So... You know, I feel like this, but I also see it happening, but in my gut, we've reached the tipping point where people are tired of labels, they're tired of race, they're tired of all the divergence, they want freedom, they want it now, and they're not taking it anymore.
[02:49:55.402 --> 02:49:56.824]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:49:56.824 --> 02:50:01.750]  And so we're not going away and we encourage people to come join, volunteer.
[02:50:01.750 --> 02:50:09.340]  We've got lots to do and we're learning so much because we didn't really know all that is involved with getting a ballot initiative.
[02:50:09.864 --> 02:50:25.363]  And wonderful people from the community are stepping up to help us, but we still have a lot of, you know, ground to cover and money and all that kind of stuff that goes with it, but we'd like to help other cities so, you know, we can help them, but if they can help us, we'll help them.
[02:50:25.363 --> 02:50:27.485]  Absolutely, and if you guys win in your town,
[02:50:28.306 --> 02:50:32.068]  And other towns, it'll become a chain reaction, and it's already a chain reaction.
[02:50:32.068 --> 02:50:35.229]  We're on the march, the empire is on the run.
[02:50:35.229 --> 02:50:36.850]  I'mprogoat.com.
[02:50:36.850 --> 02:50:38.651]  Folks, go over there, donate, support them.
[02:50:38.651 --> 02:50:40.212]  This is a great test case.
[02:50:40.212 --> 02:50:42.853]  You couldn't do better, and pray for them and support them.
[02:50:42.853 --> 02:50:46.634]  Ladies, I want to have you both back up soon for an update on the nightly news.
[02:50:46.634 --> 02:50:47.735]  Thank you so much.
[02:50:47.735 --> 02:50:49.196]  We're going to come back.
[02:50:49.196 --> 02:50:50.596]  I'm thinking you, you're not thinking me.
[02:50:50.596 --> 02:50:52.617]  You're the ones taking action at the grassroots.
[02:50:52.617 --> 02:50:54.218]  It's that first step that's the most beautiful.
[02:50:54.298 --> 02:51:03.201]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic, and only one system allows you to produce an endless supply of nano-sized silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[02:51:03.201 --> 02:51:04.301]  Silver Lungs.

[02:51:11.603 --> 02:51:17.465]  This pioneering method also preserves the original particle sizes and delivers your silver solution directly into the bloodstream.
[02:51:17.625 --> 02:51:21.749]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and Lung Delivery System at SilverLungs.com.
[02:51:21.749 --> 02:51:24.271]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[02:51:24.271 --> 02:51:30.417]  Virtually anyone can hack your cell phone and track your calls, your texts, your emails, your every movement.
[02:51:30.417 --> 02:51:32.499]  But only if they can detect a signal.
[02:51:32.499 --> 02:51:36.503]  Stay one step ahead of hackers and Big Brother with a Blockett Pocket.
[02:51:36.503 --> 02:51:41.808]  A custom-made pocket infused with pure silver that creates a complete Faraday enclosure for your cell phone.

[02:51:51.353 --> 02:51:53.394]  Enhancing health and privacy.
[02:51:53.394 --> 02:51:57.636]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:51:57.636 --> 02:51:58.276]  It's true.
[02:51:58.276 --> 02:52:02.418]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:52:02.418 --> 02:52:04.820]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:52:04.820 --> 02:52:09.302]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[02:52:09.602 --> 02:52:22.469]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.
[02:52:22.469 --> 02:52:26.271]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[02:52:26.271 --> 02:52:28.912]  The gold standard in water purification.
[02:52:28.912 --> 02:52:33.235]  And our filters last for years at less than two cents per gallon.
[02:52:33.235 --> 02:52:37.517]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[02:52:37.757 --> 02:52:39.498]  Get your Big Berkey today.
[02:52:39.498 --> 02:52:41.820]  Call 1-877-99-BERKEY or click BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[02:52:41.820 --> 02:52:42.621]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[02:52:42.621 --> 02:52:44.042]  Big Berkey Water Filters.
[02:52:44.042 --> 02:52:45.062]  For the love of clean water.
[02:52:53.291 --> 02:52:55.053]  Honey, it's time for dinner.
[02:52:55.053 --> 02:52:56.935]  What are you doing over there on your computer?
[02:52:56.935 --> 02:52:58.416]  I'm shopping for a new wallet.
[02:52:58.416 --> 02:52:59.958]  Mine is falling apart.
[02:52:59.958 --> 02:53:06.124]  Hey, did you know there's a company called ID Stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing?
[02:53:06.124 --> 02:53:09.347]  Oh, I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing.
[02:53:09.347 --> 02:53:09.888]  What is that?
[02:53:10.188 --> 02:53:19.735]  Well apparently, many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID to transmit our banking information to card readers when we pay.
[02:53:19.735 --> 02:53:28.441]  Unfortunately, a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people, collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing it.
[02:53:28.441 --> 02:53:29.082]  Wow!
[02:53:29.082 --> 02:53:30.403]  That sounds scary.
[02:53:30.403 --> 02:53:34.846]  Since you're getting a new wallet anyway, you should definitely get an ID Stronghold shielded wallet.
[02:53:34.846 --> 02:53:35.667]  Are they more expensive?
[02:53:36.107 --> 02:53:36.607]  No.
[02:53:36.607 --> 02:53:44.290]  In fact, I can get a shielded leather wallet from IDStronghold.com for the same price or less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores.
[02:53:44.290 --> 02:53:45.470]  Sounds great!
[02:53:45.470 --> 02:53:48.111]  My wallet isn't falling apart yet, but let me pick one out too.
[02:53:48.111 --> 02:53:54.253]  I want to be protected, and these wallets at IDStronghold.com look fantastic!
[02:53:54.253 --> 02:53:55.294]  Federal agents!
[02:53:55.294 --> 02:53:55.994]  We are armed!
[02:54:01.730 --> 02:54:11.659]  We did a pretty good job today.
[02:54:11.659 --> 02:54:14.903]  There is mass tons of news, though I didn't get to.
[02:54:14.903 --> 02:54:19.287]  And I shot three special reports for the nightly news last night.
[02:54:19.287 --> 02:54:20.428]  I may just have to do it again.
[02:54:23.132 --> 02:54:26.914]  I just can't believe they're trying to start a war with Russia and have thousands of U.S.
[02:54:26.914 --> 02:54:30.677]  troops doing combat training and fighting Russians.
[02:54:30.677 --> 02:54:31.337]  I mean, the U.S.
[02:54:31.337 --> 02:54:32.838]  military is fighting Russia right now.
[02:54:32.838 --> 02:54:41.544]  I mean, crazy, crazy in their backyard over Crimea that's been part of Russia for 500 years.
[02:54:45.265 --> 02:54:50.829]  There's an article from Phyllis Schlafly, no wonder Obama won't let us read TPP, they've got more sections of it.
[02:54:50.829 --> 02:54:59.616]  It's just open borders, authorizes the president to form a new transnational governance structure, close quote, with the power to compel and restrict US policy.
[02:54:59.616 --> 02:55:02.138]  That's from the document.
[02:55:02.138 --> 02:55:05.820]  I mean, just that alone we could spend three hours on.
[02:55:05.820 --> 02:55:09.163]  This is the takeover of the country right now.
[02:55:09.163 --> 02:55:11.865]  And we're like in a sword fight, barely beat them last week, we're just like,
[02:55:12.827 --> 02:55:14.967]  And then people are like, they keep attacking.
[02:55:14.967 --> 02:55:15.748]  They're going to win.
[02:55:15.748 --> 02:55:20.109]  No, we've got to decide to fight and never quit.
[02:55:20.109 --> 02:55:28.590]  Again, growing up, I was unfortunate enough to be in a lot of serious fist fights that kind of escalated by the time I was about 17 and really brutal fights.
[02:55:28.590 --> 02:55:35.172]  And one thing I learned is if you stop and wait once you're in a fight and kind of really think about what you're doing, you're going to get stomped on the ground.
[02:55:37.045 --> 02:55:39.307]  Like, people will punch you and then wait to see what it did.
[02:55:39.307 --> 02:55:42.449]  I mean, by the time you've connected with me, I'm going to connect three times.
[02:55:42.449 --> 02:55:43.290]  I'm not thinking.
[02:55:43.290 --> 02:55:45.331]  I'm going to full power attack you.
[02:55:45.331 --> 02:55:47.173]  And that's what the globalists do.
[02:55:47.173 --> 02:55:50.015]  Except they start the fight and then they start pounding.
[02:55:50.015 --> 02:55:52.877]  We have to start pounding back and not think about winning.
[02:55:52.877 --> 02:55:53.577]  It's like a race.
[02:55:53.577 --> 02:55:55.118]  I used to be a really good swimmer.
[02:55:55.118 --> 02:55:56.840]  Used to win blue ribbons every time.
[02:55:56.840 --> 02:55:58.181]  You know, like Dallas level meets.
[02:55:58.181 --> 02:55:59.261]  I mean, I was a good swimmer.
[02:55:59.261 --> 02:56:00.382]  I quit when I was 13, but I was...
[02:56:01.523 --> 02:56:02.464]  Really good.
[02:56:02.464 --> 02:56:04.865]  You know, could have gotten scholarships and stuff.
[02:56:04.865 --> 02:56:16.011]  And a lot of people would be in a long race, a relay or something, or a long distance race, however many meters, and they would like look to see who was behind them.
[02:56:16.011 --> 02:56:17.851]  You don't look to see who's behind.
[02:56:17.851 --> 02:56:24.455]  I remember so many times I'd watch a film of it and I'd be right behind him and the person would look and I'd beat him.
[02:56:25.902 --> 02:56:26.703]  And it's the same thing.
[02:56:26.703 --> 02:56:28.644]  Stop worrying about who's going to win.
[02:56:28.644 --> 02:56:29.845]  They're in the wrong.
[02:56:29.845 --> 02:56:30.986]  We're going to fight them.
[02:56:30.986 --> 02:56:32.367]  We're going to tell the truth.
[02:56:32.367 --> 02:56:34.108]  Let the chips fall where they may.
[02:56:34.108 --> 02:56:36.330]  We're done.
[02:56:36.330 --> 02:56:37.151]  Same thing.
[02:56:37.151 --> 02:56:39.052]  You'll see these Olympic runners.
[02:56:39.052 --> 02:56:40.754]  And one of them's winning, one of them's winning.
[02:56:40.754 --> 02:56:41.734]  And they look back.
[02:56:41.734 --> 02:56:43.956]  And as soon as they do that, they lose momentum.
[02:56:43.956 --> 02:56:45.958]  It's like, why do you do that?
[02:56:45.958 --> 02:56:46.878]  Why do you look back?
[02:56:46.878 --> 02:56:53.203]  Don't look back.
[02:56:53.203 --> 02:56:54.925]  I mean, there's so much I meant to get to here.
[02:56:56.482 --> 02:57:07.068]  I've got this article where a sheriff in his uniform gave a speech and so they're flipping out saying he should be removed.
[02:57:07.068 --> 02:57:15.614]  He's elected, he can wear a cosmonaut outfit if he wants to up on the stage.
[02:57:15.614 --> 02:57:17.475]  Look at this, always in Florida.
[02:57:17.475 --> 02:57:21.777]  Florida sheriff under fire for preaching in a uniform.
[02:57:21.777 --> 02:57:25.840]  Grady Judd asked if the world would be better if we all behaved like Christians.
[02:57:27.145 --> 02:57:28.885]  Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd.
[02:57:28.885 --> 02:57:31.066]  See, now they're saying you don't have any free speech.
[02:57:31.066 --> 02:57:34.887]  He can do whatever he wants, but they twist it where it's offensive.
[02:57:34.887 --> 02:57:39.208]  He's under fire after a group says he broke the law by giving a sermon in uniform.
[02:57:39.208 --> 02:57:40.668]  He didn't break any law!
[02:57:40.668 --> 02:57:43.168]  He's elected!
[02:57:43.168 --> 02:57:55.311]  Now, if he was a city police chief, the council could reprimand him if they want to be a bunch of communists and violate his free speech, but Judd spoke from a pulpit at First Baptist Church in the mall in Lakeland two months ago.
[02:57:57.045 --> 02:58:03.129]  Freedom from Religion Foundation sent judge a letter accusing him of excluding other religions and making non-believers feel like outsiders in the country.
[02:58:03.129 --> 02:58:06.892]  And see how they ran the fraud, the hoax?
[02:58:06.892 --> 02:58:09.934]  You know, in their statement that it was illegal, but then there's no law.
[02:58:09.934 --> 02:58:13.197]  It's all just, it's illegal not to take vaccines, no law.
[02:58:13.197 --> 02:58:15.738]  It's illegal to live in uniform, you have an opinion.
[02:58:15.738 --> 02:58:18.340]  I mean, it's all lies!
[02:58:18.340 --> 02:58:18.881]  Lies!
[02:58:21.912 --> 02:58:23.473]  Alright, I'm out of... I'm out of time.
[02:58:23.473 --> 02:58:24.413]  There's a bunch I didn't get to.
[02:58:24.413 --> 02:58:28.655]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, like this whopper.
[02:58:28.655 --> 02:58:28.935]  You know what?
[02:58:28.935 --> 02:58:30.135]  I'm gonna do Father's Overdrive.
[02:58:30.135 --> 02:58:31.275]  You know I can't help it.
[02:58:31.275 --> 02:58:32.296]  Some stations don't carry it.
[02:58:32.296 --> 02:58:34.557]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:34.557 --> 02:58:37.678]  And don't forget the new product, Liver Shield's out.

[02:59:46.574 --> 02:59:49.180]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:56.764 --> 03:00:03.388]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:03.388 --> 03:00:07.071]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:07.071 --> 03:00:12.655]  From InfoWars.com, privacy expert, time-traveling robots could punish future crimes.
[03:00:12.655 --> 03:00:14.616]  That's what they're actually talking about.
[03:00:14.616 --> 03:00:17.698]  You're committing signs of the future that you don't know or sense yet.
[03:00:19.164 --> 03:00:21.126]  You're committing sins of the future.
[03:00:21.126 --> 03:00:33.596]  Privacy expert Brad Tibbleman warns that artificial intelligent robots could one day come through digital data left by internet users and retroactively punish them for future crimes that are not yet detected or considered to be a crime at that time.
[03:00:33.596 --> 03:00:39.901]  Yeah, because it's left on the web, so it's like you wrote a book that's illegal now.
[03:00:39.901 --> 03:00:41.623]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of him breaking it down.
[03:00:42.847 --> 03:00:46.109]  The truth is that today, AI is still in its early stages.
[03:00:46.109 --> 03:00:46.789]  It's still primitive.
[03:00:46.789 --> 03:00:52.812]  We cannot build an engine that could recognize any random face in the world, take a picture of someone and tell you who that is.
[03:00:52.812 --> 03:00:54.473]  That you know of.
[03:00:54.473 --> 03:00:55.394]  You've all used Siri.
[03:00:55.394 --> 03:00:59.236]  You know that natural language and speech recognition still have a long way to go.
[03:00:59.236 --> 03:01:00.216]  Facial expression recognition.
[03:01:00.216 --> 03:01:03.038]  They're all there, but they're in very early stages.
[03:01:03.038 --> 03:01:06.599]  But those early stages, they're not going to last forever.
[03:01:06.599 --> 03:01:11.202]  It's true that we have to worry about the threat of time-traveling robots from the future.
[03:01:11.807 --> 03:01:20.713]  I'm talking about the fact that even though AIs today might ask, what is Toronto, to a Jeopardy category about United States cities, that's not always going to be the case.
[03:01:20.713 --> 03:01:23.736]  And in the future, they will get good at answering these questions.
[03:01:23.736 --> 03:01:25.617]  They will get good at that face recognition.
[03:01:25.617 --> 03:01:27.819]  They will get good at that speech recognition.
[03:01:27.819 --> 03:01:31.781]  And understanding everything, all this data that's going through, at a much deeper level.
[03:01:31.781 --> 03:01:39.287]  And eventually, they'll approach the ability, and even in some cases, as you'll learn later on this morning from Jeremy Howard, to pass human abilities at recognizing things.
[03:01:39.827 --> 03:01:46.550]  And that means something important, because today, while the AI is not that good, we are getting very good at recording everything.
[03:01:46.550 --> 03:01:49.911]  Because storage has gotten cheap, cheap, cheap.
[03:01:49.911 --> 03:02:04.357]  And so we are recording all that stuff that goes through Facebook, all the stuff that goes through networks, all the movements of your cell phones that I told you about, all the video from those surveillance cameras that you passed by today, and ATM machines, and stores, and so on, and here on a military basis.
[03:02:04.357 --> 03:02:07.638]  That's all being recorded, and in the future they'll be able to analyze that data.
[03:02:08.058 --> 03:02:15.283]  And they'll be able to ask, are you now or have you ever been a member of some strange organization like Singularity University Alumni or anything else.
[03:02:15.283 --> 03:02:16.744]  They'll be able to look into the past.
[03:02:16.744 --> 03:02:26.290]  They won't, like the Terminator, be able to come back to the past to kill you, but they will be able to look into your past and see what you were doing at any time in the past at a much better ability than they have today.
[03:02:26.290 --> 03:02:30.853]  So you actually have to worry today about what A.I.s in the future are going to be able to do.
[03:02:30.853 --> 03:02:36.117]  And one reason is that you are committing sins of the future that you don't know are sins yet.
[03:02:37.382 --> 03:02:47.579]  This is Thomas Jefferson, revered in the United States, of course, for his contribution to the founding of this country, but also reviled as a slave owner, as all the Virginia landowners of his day were.
[03:02:49.292 --> 03:02:53.494]  And that's something, of course, that today we have a, quite correctly, have a different view on.
[03:02:53.494 --> 03:02:59.156]  But nonetheless, there are, mores change from time to time, and so people will look into your past and know what's going on.
[03:02:59.156 --> 03:03:08.279]  So if you thought it was bad enough to worry about what they think of you now, I'm telling you, you have to worry about what they're going to think of you in the future, because they're going to know everything you're doing now.
[03:03:08.279 --> 03:03:11.620]  Very well said, and look, it's already happening.
[03:03:13.413 --> 03:03:33.468]  This is predicting the future, and if you can predict the future, you can then add stimuli to manipulate the future, and that's how Amazon for two years can pack your package before you order it, hours before, knowing with an algorithm with 99.9% accuracy, in their words, when you're going to purchase the product.
[03:03:33.468 --> 03:03:39.113]  Not just off your shopping history there, but your shopping history all over the place.
[03:03:39.113 --> 03:03:39.793]  That's what I mean.
[03:03:39.793 --> 03:03:41.734]  We've got to decide to get a handle on this now,
[03:03:42.785 --> 03:03:47.606]  And control this so that it doesn't destroy us.
[03:03:47.606 --> 03:03:53.387]  Because elites are already using these technologies to game things to destroy free markets.
[03:03:53.387 --> 03:03:59.169]  You talk about disruptive technologies, the globalism is what's disruptive.
[03:03:59.169 --> 03:04:03.769]  It's globalists claiming they're trying to create unity and freedom and transparency.
[03:04:03.769 --> 03:04:08.691]  They're creating a giant new dark age for the general public, but not for themselves.
[03:04:08.691 --> 03:04:10.511]  The problem is they're so distorted and dark
[03:04:12.261 --> 03:04:19.122]  They're channeling such evil, wicked energy that you give them this omnipresent type power, it is going to be explosive.
[03:04:19.122 --> 03:04:23.163]  Again, I mentioned it for 10 seconds last hour, 10 seconds of plugging last hour.
[03:04:23.163 --> 03:04:26.764]  We have the new Liver Shield, highest quality, organic liver detox.
[03:04:26.764 --> 03:04:29.645]  You can take it daily or you can do the cleanse.
[03:04:29.645 --> 03:04:32.825]  The video is now up on InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:04:32.825 --> 03:04:35.926]  You can also read reviews there on the other products.
[03:04:35.926 --> 03:04:37.666]  There's not reviews in on this yet.
[03:04:37.666 --> 03:04:39.847]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:04:42.102 --> 03:04:44.085]  And we've got a special on it, an oxy powder.
[03:04:44.085 --> 03:04:45.066]  It goes together.
[03:04:45.066 --> 03:04:47.590]  Dramatic, what it does to the gallbladder.
[03:04:47.590 --> 03:04:49.974]  Go see the videos of the gallstones, the rest of it.
[03:04:49.974 --> 03:04:51.235]  It's just amazing.
[03:04:51.235 --> 03:04:52.077]  I didn't know about this.
[03:04:52.077 --> 03:04:53.098]  I think it'll blow you away.
