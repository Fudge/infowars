[00:00.000 --> 00:23.360]  Nice guy, got a lot of problems coming up in my opinion with the famous island with
[00:23.360 --> 00:24.360]  Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:24.360 --> 00:25.360]  A lot of problems.
[00:25.360 --> 00:26.360]  You think it was over the line?
[00:26.360 --> 00:29.040]  I don't know because I don't know her but it was nasty.
[00:29.040 --> 00:32.040]  You raised the question of Jeffrey Epstein in your remarks event and then Q&A.
[00:32.040 --> 00:33.040]  Well I think he's got a problem.
[00:33.040 --> 00:34.040]  I don't think the problem will be.
[00:34.040 --> 00:39.000]  I don't know but that island was really a cesspool, there's no question about it.
[00:39.000 --> 00:42.040]  Just ask Prince Andrew, he'll tell you about it.
[00:42.040 --> 00:44.760]  The island was an absolute cesspool.
[00:44.760 --> 00:53.400]  The island was an absolute cesspool and now with the judge ordering this data dump of
[00:53.400 --> 01:03.520]  pressed FBI documents and Epstein Gisling Maxwell documents, we learned that Mueller
[01:03.520 --> 01:08.680]  and the Clintons and all of them were involved suppressing information about themselves and
[01:08.680 --> 01:16.080]  how they were running these child molesting blackmail rings that was being managed by
[01:16.080 --> 01:22.600]  the Clinton Obama era FBI at the top and we also in the documents learned that they tried
[01:22.600 --> 01:31.280]  to have the FBI implicate Donald John Trump because as we've told you years ago he was
[01:31.280 --> 01:38.000]  a confidential informant to the FBI in Palm Beach saying that the word is Epstein is engaged
[01:38.000 --> 01:40.600]  in criminal activity with underage girls.
[01:40.600 --> 01:45.960]  Everybody knows Donald Trump doesn't like little girls, Donald Trump likes intimidating
[01:45.960 --> 01:50.960]  bombshell females, powerful type A females.
[01:50.960 --> 01:56.280]  I've never been since I was an adult intimidated by women, not intimidated by men, but I have
[01:56.280 --> 02:03.920]  met Melania Trump just once and I was intimidated, talk about Wonder Woman, that's the type
[02:03.920 --> 02:09.960]  of powerful man that wants a powerful woman and so I'm the same way, I mean I'm like
[02:09.960 --> 02:14.680]  from Mexico I'd say I like a big juicy you know the whole nine yards, I would never be
[02:14.680 --> 02:19.880]  attracted to a little girl because I'm empowered, I want a powerful woman but these pedophiles
[02:19.880 --> 02:26.400]  they want to suck the energy off these little girls, little boys, they want to be creepy,
[02:26.400 --> 02:31.480]  Weinstein's really gross, he likes to have underage girls clean reportedly like skin
[02:31.480 --> 02:38.280]  growths under his belly and he has a vagina as well reportedly, he's an aphrodite, I mean
[02:38.280 --> 02:44.360]  if you imagine all of this he like makes like 15 year old girls start throwing up when he's
[02:44.360 --> 02:48.680]  like all stinking and gross and they have to go like pat on him and everything, I mean
[02:48.680 --> 02:52.520]  it's all about humiliation and I'm sorry to tell you all that folks but I think you really
[02:52.520 --> 02:58.600]  need to know and it's the same thing with Jeffrey Epstein, he has sexually deformed
[02:58.600 --> 03:03.880]  genitals, you don't get in the globalist club unless you're really screwed up, they're
[03:03.880 --> 03:08.880]  fallen, they're diseased, they're inbred globalists and that's why they don't like those of us
[03:08.880 --> 03:13.720]  that aren't, why they want to make us twisted and fallen and ugly like them, yet the British
[03:13.720 --> 03:19.960]  royalty all inbred as well, so it's all a bunch of inbred hunchbacked demons who get
[03:19.960 --> 03:25.360]  all the power because they want the power, because they don't have the power.
[03:25.360 --> 03:31.080]  So now it's all coming out, oh another little surprise way before October and I really like
[03:31.080 --> 03:38.600]  how Trump's attacking now, don't wait until October, attack, launch everything now and
[03:38.600 --> 03:45.320]  then launch even more because there's such a treasure trove, you could release bombshells
[03:45.320 --> 03:51.280]  every 30 seconds from now until the election and not burn down the deep state quick enough
[03:51.280 --> 03:58.000]  and there is just so much and so these neural order types that think that they are going
[03:58.000 --> 04:02.560]  to burn down the country and destroy it and hand it over to the chai comms, you got another
[04:02.560 --> 04:08.840]  thing coming because what did von Bismarck say, God loves children, drunks in the United
[04:08.840 --> 04:16.520]  States of America, so count our lucky stars again, I mean we're not out of the woods yet,
[04:16.520 --> 04:20.240]  by the way there's so much huge news and I have trouble even dealing with it, I was shown
[04:20.240 --> 04:29.000]  secret documents yesterday by APD that I'm not allowed to show you on air about how
[04:29.000 --> 04:33.480]  this Saturday they're planning to take over the police station and burn it down, they're
[04:33.480 --> 04:38.240]  actually trafficking this at meetings rum of the democrats, I mean hell the city councils
[04:38.240 --> 04:42.320]  are going to blow it up, blow up the police station, hell that's public and now they're
[04:42.320 --> 04:47.520]  going to have overwatch snipers all over on top of parking garages that they're planning
[04:47.520 --> 04:53.760]  to shoot police and citizens if anyone stops Antifa taking control of major roads and setting
[04:53.760 --> 05:00.760]  up checkpoints, I'm not kidding you're going to have UT tower shootings this weekend I
[05:00.760 --> 05:01.760]  guess.
[05:01.760 --> 05:08.920]  Vicky Gibbs, 57 year old lesbian preacher in Houston went in with a cough, got intubated
[05:08.920 --> 05:14.480]  and then died and as soon as I saw her face, as soon as I saw the report I said watch it
[05:14.480 --> 05:20.320]  will be innovation, we know what's going to happen, it's a blue city, same story yet again
[05:20.320 --> 05:25.680]  and they say her heart gave out, if you put somebody on a breathing tube of COVID-19 as
[05:25.680 --> 05:29.600]  a death sentence it's on record, want everyone you know before they go to the hospital and
[05:29.600 --> 05:34.120]  get killed, why are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities and blue states it's
[05:34.120 --> 05:39.400]  because they intubate them putting a tube in their lungs and COVID-19 is causing an auto
[05:39.400 --> 05:44.520]  immune response and if you do that with oxygen the doctors are on records saying it will
[05:44.520 --> 05:50.560]  kill you but all these doctors in blue cities and blue states follow their orders and the
[05:50.560 --> 05:55.680]  minute I saw this report today I knew what I would be reading, don't end up like Vicky
[05:55.680 --> 06:06.000]  Gibbs or everyone.
[06:06.000 --> 06:14.800]  From coast to coast, from border to border, from sea to shining sea, the deep state globalist
[06:14.800 --> 06:22.040]  controlled democrats are planning this weekend the takeover of at least six more city police
[06:22.040 --> 06:29.800]  departments starting with an attack plan this Saturday night, now us exposing this may have
[06:29.800 --> 06:33.120]  them back down and then the media will say oh fake news from Jones but you've already
[06:33.120 --> 06:36.160]  seen the takeover of police departments and trying to take over federal buildings and
[06:36.160 --> 06:39.080]  the shootings and the bombings and all the deaths and the rest of it that were being
[06:39.080 --> 06:43.600]  told as peaceful demonstrations but I have been shown by the APD they have asked that
[06:43.600 --> 06:48.080]  we not actually show the documents themselves because you can tell what unit and groups
[06:48.080 --> 06:51.560]  they are but the police think you have a right to know about this.
[06:51.560 --> 06:59.520]  They have overwatch already with Antifa in apartments, in high rises on balconies but
[06:59.520 --> 07:05.960]  mainly in parking garages like their army special operations command or something and
[07:05.960 --> 07:11.000]  they are going to have men in pickup trucks that are already out there practicing setting
[07:11.000 --> 07:17.240]  up checkpoints, shutting down roads and ordering people to roll down their windows and pledge
[07:17.240 --> 07:22.240]  allegiance to Antifa like this individual was doing a week ago who got shot and killed
[07:22.240 --> 07:23.240]  downtown.
[07:23.240 --> 07:31.200]  There was a community of the army sergeant who was doing his second job, drive share,
[07:31.200 --> 07:37.320]  food delivery, ride share and food delivery, what this is that he indeed did aim a gun
[07:37.320 --> 07:42.520]  at him so the army sergeant shot him five times in the chest to protect his own life
[07:42.520 --> 07:49.640]  that's why he has not been charged but they were already planning this because I talked
[07:49.640 --> 07:55.600]  with several sources that this new expansion of taking over the roads and now taking over
[07:55.600 --> 08:02.680]  the parking garages is not in a response to this individual, we'll just call him shark
[08:02.680 --> 08:07.240]  eyes getting killed this weekend, they were already planning to roll this out in fact
[08:07.240 --> 08:13.960]  he was part of that rollout and they have armed men all over downtown routinely walking
[08:13.960 --> 08:17.400]  up and shutting down traffic and pointing guns at people and the man that rolled down
[08:17.400 --> 08:25.800]  the window and declare filthy to George Soros' Black Lives Matter and so this is how violent
[08:25.800 --> 08:32.880]  revolution start with idiots, cannon fodder sent out to do it and the police have tried
[08:32.880 --> 08:40.240]  to be able to go up and obviously detain and arrest individuals, it's one thing to have
[08:40.240 --> 08:44.040]  an open carry and exercise your first amendment, your second amendment, we do that, we totally
[08:44.040 --> 08:48.240]  support it and when you do it properly you don't aim guns at people or you get shot
[08:48.240 --> 08:52.880]  dead and you notice we could have 40,000 people out in Virginia for our rally and not one
[08:52.880 --> 08:56.960]  person got hurt and not one problem happened, one leftist started to fight and got arrested
[08:56.960 --> 09:03.840]  and that totally freaked the globalist out but their people are just absolute again method
[09:03.840 --> 09:09.200]  devil worshiping trash on average, the scum of the earth who are there as a smoke screen
[09:09.200 --> 09:14.520]  for more serious operators behind them and so this is the type of time you're going to
[09:14.520 --> 09:22.000]  see bigger false flag event type things happen but I can tell you right now ladies and gentlemen
[09:22.000 --> 09:28.040]  that communist forces that's what Antifa is in the Soros funded Democrat Party funded
[09:28.040 --> 09:34.920]  combine are planning assaults on new police stations and federal buildings tonight all
[09:34.920 --> 09:44.280]  across the United States and when the Austin police bring photos and video of this to the
[09:44.280 --> 09:50.560]  mayor's office they are told you are to stand down I've seen the photos I've seen the videos
[09:50.560 --> 09:56.480]  I've seen the internal memorandums this is happening for sure and the rest of the press
[09:56.480 --> 09:59.780]  is being given this information of course they're not reporting it because they're little
[09:59.780 --> 10:03.680]  totes and well after all the cops deserve to be shot in the back of the head and you
[10:03.680 --> 10:08.640]  know the police station deserves to be blown up it's in the official city council budget
[10:08.640 --> 10:16.880]  to bomb with a control demolition as a symbol of stopping police aid so I mean if they're
[10:16.880 --> 10:22.880]  publicly saying in the city council blow up the police station what do you think is going
[10:22.880 --> 10:30.560]  on so there's going to be a back to blue demonstration this Saturday I think Owen and Savannah Hernandez
[10:30.560 --> 10:35.840]  are going to be going I don't want to go and overshadow it because it's not my event I
[10:35.840 --> 10:39.360]  will be rolling around downtown in the armored vehicle because we need one we're getting
[10:39.360 --> 10:47.440]  shot at here educating folks about what's happening in the country and then we are going
[10:47.440 --> 10:54.040]  to be downtown just as citizens watching what's going on in the parking garages and the rest
[10:54.040 --> 10:57.920]  of it I'm just going to leave it at that because this is the time for all good men and women
[10:57.920 --> 11:01.320]  to come to the head of their country and so wherever you are around the country but if
[11:01.320 --> 11:08.880]  you're in Milwaukee or you're in Austin Texas or you're in Phoenix Arizona or you are in
[11:08.880 --> 11:17.120]  Los Angeles California or you're in New York City or you're in Miami these are some of
[11:17.120 --> 11:22.040]  the towns that Antifa says they're going to take over the police stations and burn them
[11:22.040 --> 11:27.520]  down Saturday night and as you've seen they've done it all over the country so you should
[11:27.520 --> 11:33.520]  probably take them at their word past behavior is the most indicative of future behavior past
[11:33.520 --> 11:39.120]  performance is the most indicative of future behavior and that's what they're planning
[11:39.120 --> 11:43.480]  so that's what's going on and I would just tell everybody who's going to be anywhere
[11:43.480 --> 11:48.600]  near downtown you shouldn't go downtown in any of these cities to eat dinner if you live
[11:48.600 --> 11:52.360]  in these areas you should get out of them for the weekend is my advice if you have to
[11:52.360 --> 11:56.920]  be down there you should be wearing body armor I've never worn body armor I'm going to wear
[11:56.920 --> 12:00.800]  body armor this weekend it's important to stay in the fight and obviously I'm a big
[12:00.800 --> 12:07.040]  target but and obviously we'll be armed defensively but somebody comes up and puts a gun at us
[12:07.040 --> 12:12.080]  you know we'll defend ourselves that's just the way it is we just can't get on our knees
[12:12.080 --> 12:16.520]  to you people so you've got all these larkers that want to go out and have their live action
[12:16.520 --> 12:24.120]  role play in the real world and they what's crazy is folks I was reading this this is
[12:24.120 --> 12:30.280]  actual like Al Qaeda ISIS terrorism they are circulating on private Facebook that has been
[12:30.280 --> 12:37.200]  infiltrated by the feds the state and the local police I mean I've seen all this and
[12:37.200 --> 12:42.560]  they're in there circulating where they're going to put their snipers and and they have
[12:42.560 --> 12:46.880]  rules of engagement that if the cops try to stop somebody setting up a checkpoint and
[12:46.880 --> 12:52.480]  pointing guns at people some crazy method they're going to shoot the cops and the mayor has
[12:52.480 --> 12:59.600]  been brought the battle plans to put snipers on roofs like we're back to the ut power shooting
[12:59.600 --> 13:05.040]  and and the mayor is going to let these people deploy with guns with the stated aim of over
[13:05.040 --> 13:09.800]  watch that when men in pickup trucks are setting up checkpoints going down the wrong way as
[13:09.800 --> 13:13.280]  they're already been doing this whole week the police been told to stand down that when
[13:13.280 --> 13:19.840]  the cops or citizens resist being abused or killed they're going to start shooting from
[13:19.840 --> 13:24.480]  rooftops and again it Antifa can't hit the side of a barn folks so you're going to have
[13:24.480 --> 13:30.840]  people 200 300 400 yards away trying to shoot police cars and you know they're going to
[13:30.840 --> 13:37.840]  just shoot their own people in the demonstrations so this is the world we live in in 2020 this
[13:37.840 --> 13:42.720]  is where Soros has taken us this is where half the Justice Department being globalist
[13:42.720 --> 13:47.600]  and your average FBI agent you know now being basically an Antifa all-star this is where
[13:47.600 --> 13:54.520]  we've got on the verge of a communist overthrow and the city council of Austin the official
[13:54.520 --> 14:00.720]  budget saying hasten the control demolition of the police station as a symbol of stopping
[14:00.720 --> 14:11.080]  police hate that's where we are and people that don't even know which end of the gun
[14:11.080 --> 14:17.200]  of bullets come out of are going to be up there pretending that they're American sniper
[14:17.200 --> 14:24.440]  on top buildings with with their muzzles aimed down schooning over crowds I mean I've been
[14:24.440 --> 14:29.840]  at demonstrations before and they've had cops up in the parking garages and they have got
[14:29.840 --> 14:34.040]  their guns point out the crowd I blew up cops shouldn't be doing that I'm not a target
[14:34.040 --> 14:37.440]  demonstrators aren't some guys in a trench coat you think something's going on okay
[14:37.440 --> 14:42.560]  put a scope on them but don't be sitting there pointing your gun at me when I'm not armed
[14:42.560 --> 14:47.080]  don't do it you use your binoculars don't aim your scope at me that's a very hostile act
[14:47.080 --> 14:54.520]  well what are you going to do with Antifa is up on rooftops pointing guns at people
[14:54.520 --> 15:03.240]  and they are just absolute drug addict nuts it's bad enough of a cop's aiming at Remington
[15:03.240 --> 15:07.840]  700 308 of your head and his fingers not on the trigger his trigger discipline that's
[15:07.840 --> 15:14.960]  still not called for when you've got a meth head devil worshipper on top of rooftop whacked
[15:14.960 --> 15:20.360]  out of their gourd who plays video games all day because this is all the in cell crowd
[15:20.360 --> 15:26.960]  that's who they are this is all the in cell crowd that became liberal and so that's Austin
[15:26.960 --> 15:31.200]  Texas this Saturday night we'll do we'll be do live streams our own feed built our own
[15:31.200 --> 15:37.080]  infrastructure own network to believe in bringing this information and I've asked my police
[15:37.080 --> 15:40.880]  source to call the police and let us show you these documents because this is national
[15:40.880 --> 15:45.960]  news and they're going over the documents right now to see if there's some way to black
[15:45.960 --> 15:51.320]  things out so that we can show you this because I mean there's maps put out by Antifa of where
[15:51.320 --> 15:55.520]  they're going to have shooters on top buildings aiming guns at you and your family and that's
[15:55.520 --> 16:03.000]  the communists for you states cracking down on social gatherings says CNN because Fauci
[16:03.000 --> 16:09.760]  says if we don't we'll see further surges in coronavirus positives because they're only
[16:09.760 --> 16:15.680]  ramping up the testing because the test have been designed at the Wuhan lab it turns out
[16:15.680 --> 16:22.120]  to be completely fraudulent they cook the whole thing up offshore in a communist dictatorship
[16:22.120 --> 16:28.840]  with Fauci Bill Gates and the chai comms to be directed by the UN as a giant planetary
[16:28.840 --> 16:33.880]  power grab and now it's all over the news that indeed Bill Gates has developed digital
[16:33.880 --> 16:39.560]  tattoos under your skin and so is Google and they're deploying them at the airports
[16:39.560 --> 16:43.880]  next year where you'll have to have it to be able to travel oh and then soon to leave
[16:43.880 --> 16:48.560]  your house or go in a grocery store and the contact tracers work for Bill and the Gates
[16:48.560 --> 16:52.000]  and the Clintons and they're going to come to your house and make sure you're inoculated
[16:52.000 --> 16:59.720]  yes we're now inside the mark of the beast there are only a few days left to take advantage
[16:59.720 --> 17:07.120]  of the biggest info war sale of 2020 so far it is Christmas in July and July ends this
[17:07.120 --> 17:13.360]  Friday the longest we can run it is a few extra days until Sunday because we are selling
[17:13.360 --> 17:18.760]  out of almost all of our best selling products and the supply chain is breaking down with
[17:18.760 --> 17:25.920]  many of our manufacturers and so a lot of the reorders are held up months in many cases
[17:25.920 --> 17:31.920]  this could be the last chance you got in the year 2020 to get these amazing products that
[17:31.920 --> 17:37.320]  empower you and your family's life and health your immune systems you name it your stamina
[17:37.320 --> 17:44.560]  your libido your focus but also you know funds the info war and everything we're doing to
[17:44.560 --> 17:49.000]  save this republic from the clutches of the globalist in the new world order all of our
[17:49.000 --> 17:54.160]  best selling items 50% off store it for shipping double page reports take advantage of it right
[17:54.160 --> 18:10.960]  now while there's still time you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[18:10.960 --> 18:14.760]  welcome back I'm your host Alex Jones so we have in our possession but APD's asses
[18:14.760 --> 18:22.360]  not to show it on air for a lot of obvious reasons all the intelligence links of where
[18:22.360 --> 18:27.440]  they got the intel and the maps and the training and the planning to then build their own map
[18:27.440 --> 18:32.400]  of where Antifa and BLM Soros funded terrorist the same types that overthrew Ukraine six
[18:32.400 --> 18:36.680]  years ago the exact same tactics they ordered the police to stand down they tried shooting
[18:36.680 --> 18:42.160]  the police and the public stood down they overthrew and the government took over they're
[18:42.160 --> 18:46.560]  not going to get rid of the police they're going to take them over and you see the little
[18:46.560 --> 18:50.160]  drug addict devil worshipper and if you think well those people won't do that they're the
[18:50.160 --> 18:58.200]  cannon fodder so what we're going to do is we're going to show you the intel we've been
[18:58.200 --> 19:02.160]  sent the links and we're going to just reconstruct it for you show it to you that way but obviously
[19:02.160 --> 19:09.240]  some of the locations we're not going to show for obvious reasons but imagine being on Facebook
[19:09.240 --> 19:16.560]  and publicly preparing to put snipers dozens of them on rooftops talking about your rules
[19:16.560 --> 19:24.400]  of engagement that in police engage the demonstrators that are going to take over the police station
[19:24.400 --> 19:32.440]  and set up their own chomp chazz down on 7th street in 535 that they're going to open fire
[19:32.440 --> 19:40.440]  on the police and the mayor has told them that no police are allowed to use pepper spray
[19:40.440 --> 19:46.160]  or rubber bullets except SWAT that's a tiny unit and so you're going to see boiling out
[19:46.160 --> 19:51.800]  of their holes 10,000 communists globalist meth heads homeless drug addicts criminals
[19:51.800 --> 19:56.120]  that want to take advantage of it basically devil worshippers is what they are I mean
[19:56.120 --> 19:59.520]  go out and talk to them I mean that all these videos of antifa what do you identify as I'm
[19:59.520 --> 20:05.680]  a Satanist that wants to kill babies and hate America and that's what they actually say
[20:05.680 --> 20:11.240]  and the police again in Austin Austin is the next Portland Austin is the next Seattle but
[20:11.240 --> 20:15.560]  they didn't have armed men in trucks already setting up checkpoints and the police told
[20:15.560 --> 20:21.280]  us to stand out and so that way these weird crazy brainwashed people that are being paid
[20:21.280 --> 20:26.400]  $20 an hour to do this and the academics that control them it's mainly academics weathermen
[20:26.400 --> 20:30.600]  2.0 types they're going out and driving the wrong way and setting up checkpoints and
[20:30.600 --> 20:36.360]  pointing guns at people it's happened hundreds of times we've confirmed only once did the
[20:36.360 --> 20:41.480]  individual get shot last weekend because it was an army sergeant doing a second job delivering
[20:41.480 --> 20:46.800]  food veteran of Afghanistan they start beating on his car they block his car the guy comes
[20:46.800 --> 20:51.960]  up raises his rifle the videos come out and he shot him five times in the chest everybody
[20:51.960 --> 20:55.680]  else though just like you heard the guy before he got killed he said I'm intimidating everybody
[20:55.680 --> 21:01.280]  they're a bunch of wimps use the P word they're a bunch of pussycats I love it I'm out here
[21:01.280 --> 21:06.880]  letting the racists know I'm the boss just random old ladies random people terrorizing
[21:06.880 --> 21:14.560]  them and the police have to sit there under orders and put up with that that's the country
[21:14.560 --> 21:20.640]  we live in in 2020 and then the president has the federal and state courts everybody
[21:20.640 --> 21:32.080]  saying that he's bad for not letting him burn down the federal courthouse in Oregon in Portland
[21:32.080 --> 21:39.160]  this isn't again a dystopic novel you're reading this isn't satire this is really going on
[21:39.160 --> 21:43.800]  and you ask well why because we've appeased everything they take knees during the national
[21:43.800 --> 21:50.040]  anthem and now say America itself is bad all the big NBA people worship communist China
[21:50.040 --> 21:55.000]  and their death camps but we're bad we let convicted pedophiles come into schools and
[21:55.000 --> 22:06.480]  have access to our children during pervert pedophile story time we kill 62 million babies
[22:06.480 --> 22:12.760]  Fauci under UN directives sent people with the flu and pneumonia into nursing homes in
[22:12.760 --> 22:18.240]  10 states where over half the deaths happen now and that little mass murderer goes up
[22:18.240 --> 22:26.280]  on TV yesterday and says with Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC it's good to ban these doctors at
[22:26.280 --> 22:29.320]  their press conferences they shouldn't be allowed to have speech it's dangerous to
[22:29.320 --> 22:34.520]  SINFO when he's the one that had his study funded by Gates that hydroxychloroquine doesn't
[22:34.520 --> 22:39.960]  help you pulled because it was a lie he's the one that said 2.5 million would be dead
[22:39.960 --> 22:44.640]  he's the one that set the parameters at the UN level to say that everybody that dies of
[22:44.640 --> 22:48.320]  car wrecks or gunshot wounds is COVID-19 he's the one that said we're not going to count
[22:48.320 --> 22:51.840]  flu deaths as flu now we're going to count them as COVID-19 I have all the documents
[22:51.840 --> 22:57.000]  next hour we'll get into that he's the one that's lied and lied with fake tests and
[22:57.000 --> 23:01.400]  then tests from China that were contaminated with COVID-19 which is a real virus a bad
[23:01.400 --> 23:06.560]  pneumonia with incredible gain of function but still not as deadly as they wanted and
[23:06.560 --> 23:10.800]  plus higher kills it so they've got a problem they're adding all the deaths and you've got
[23:10.800 --> 23:15.840]  the July effect where all these new doctors and nurses come on into their residency every
[23:15.840 --> 23:21.680]  year you have a spike in deaths because of that so they call medical practice a practice
[23:21.680 --> 23:30.800]  you practice on your patients it's a cult and some doctors are good some are bad and
[23:30.800 --> 23:35.880]  the UN admits that the doctors knew the vaccines were hurting people and so now doctors themselves
[23:35.880 --> 23:40.960]  thousands of them have been censored on Twitter Facebook YouTube Google all of it for coming
[23:40.960 --> 23:46.320]  out and saying hydroxychloroquine saving people but now major states are reversing and saying
[23:46.320 --> 23:50.600]  we're not following NIH guidelines even though Trump said stop doing those guidelines the
[23:50.600 --> 23:54.760]  NIH ignores him we're going to say you can treat with hydroxychloroquine because you
[23:54.760 --> 24:06.680]  always could for any viral infection it was a default imagine that an approved multi hundred
[24:06.680 --> 24:15.800]  year old drug that's known to treat pneumonia and they tell you oh your doctor can't prescribe
[24:15.800 --> 24:24.560]  Advil for joint pain you're like everybody does that nope no can't it's the equivalent
[24:24.560 --> 24:33.040]  of that and I've got all the documents here where they had to withdraw their whole study
[24:33.040 --> 24:41.040]  because they they want you dead folks this is a bio weapon that only kills people deficient
[24:41.040 --> 24:49.600]  in zinc vitamin D3 and C and old people get to where their guts do not absorb those anymore
[24:49.600 --> 24:54.200]  already healthy person absorbs very little D3 you get to be 70 80 years old that's what
[24:54.200 --> 25:00.760]  they've got to take bigger dosages of C D3 and zinc when you're older are there side
[25:00.760 --> 25:07.200]  effects absolutely high level you meet folks if you take 300 milligrams of zinc a day the
[25:07.200 --> 25:11.240]  studies say you can't get a viral infection you can't but it'll kill your kidneys in a
[25:11.240 --> 25:16.600]  couple years that's why you want to I personally decided to take about 60 milligrams a day
[25:16.600 --> 25:23.840]  it's not the best for your kidneys drink plenty of water but your cells are in like Flynn
[25:23.840 --> 25:30.000]  baby that's why it's called essential and I know I keep hammering this but you want
[25:30.000 --> 25:35.800]  to save lives folks Louis Gomer got tested positive for covid he says he feels great
[25:35.800 --> 25:44.240]  he's taking hydroxychloroquine zinc and erythromycin why is he taking the Z pack because the number
[25:44.240 --> 25:53.680]  one carrier of viruses is bacteria bacteria I always hear like why is the doctor prescribing
[25:53.680 --> 26:02.320]  antibiotics for viral infection because that's what carries the viruses is the bacteria big
[26:02.320 --> 26:10.280]  studies out that will get to that though the antibiotics are causing leaky gut and Crohn's
[26:10.280 --> 26:16.480]  disease and all these problems but then the other studies show you just take your probiotic
[26:16.480 --> 26:21.280]  or eat a ton of yogurt and things and act and you'll get it replaced but they don't
[26:21.280 --> 26:26.080]  tell people that because they don't make money when you eat a bunch of yogurt or sauerkraut
[26:26.080 --> 26:34.880]  or pickles or what any old black lady would tell you 50 years ago that if you got gut
[26:34.880 --> 26:38.120]  problems you can you go eat clay out of the side of the river because Europeans did that
[26:38.120 --> 26:42.360]  too and that's got all the trade stuff that you need right there as well let's see nobody
[26:42.360 --> 26:46.200]  makes money to go eat clay outside of the river bank now they rather give you a rest
[26:46.200 --> 26:49.960]  jazzevier that doesn't even work cause you thousands of dollars and kills your ass this
[26:49.960 --> 26:57.260]  voucher makes money off that a lot of you are probably already very familiar with these
[26:57.260 --> 27:02.800]  terms about to introduce but some folks are so those that aren't here they are activated
[27:02.800 --> 27:12.480]  charcoal and then another term enamel safe activated charcoal is the fastest growing

[29:57.720 --> 30:14.520]  we're listening to the alex jones show we're receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[30:14.520 --> 30:20.000]  to the globalists if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance you're
[30:20.000 --> 30:30.200]  listening to alex jones all right we're digesting open source intel we weren't just sent the
[30:30.200 --> 30:35.280]  intelligence reports obviously we have the raw data and that's that's good we're gonna
[30:35.280 --> 30:41.400]  go back and reconstruct it ourselves and put that as a report for you of antifut with five
[30:41.400 --> 30:47.080]  man sniper teams in buildings all downtown in their own words and photos of them already
[30:47.080 --> 30:52.640]  going there and doing dry runs and then their rules of engagement that if anyone tries to
[30:52.640 --> 30:56.640]  stop the takeover the police department and burning it down they will be shot and killed
[30:56.640 --> 31:04.760]  this weekend so this is this is actual terrorism being publicly planned with with mayor adler
[31:04.760 --> 31:12.240]  and all of them fully aware and letting it happen now that would sound crazy a year ago
[31:12.240 --> 31:18.200]  six months ago wouldn't it but you see the city of austin saying in their new budget
[31:18.200 --> 31:24.480]  we're gonna blow up the police department as a symbol of ending police hate you see them
[31:24.480 --> 31:28.600]  saying it's peaceful to shoot people at checkpoints and take over buildings and burn them down
[31:28.600 --> 31:33.960]  I mean they're normalizing and encouraging their people to believe they have immunity
[31:33.960 --> 31:38.680]  if they go out and engage in criminal activity that's what this is because you know bill
[31:38.680 --> 31:45.840]  clinton and obama and hillary and geslain maxwell and and and and and and ted turner
[31:45.840 --> 31:53.880]  and and bill gates and all these people they're not gonna do this themselves they're trying
[31:53.880 --> 32:00.560]  to get us to kill each other and they got enough wound up idiots who think they're on
[32:00.560 --> 32:06.080]  the right side of history that they're already doing you know just like i got a road warrior
[32:06.080 --> 32:14.400]  a fictitious future where australia is collapsing for nuclear war or whatever and there's guys
[32:14.400 --> 32:18.960]  rolling around in cars and motorcycles setting up checkpoints and robbing and raping that's
[32:18.960 --> 32:30.640]  what's going on in austin right now and you've got the disciplined police following robotically
[32:30.640 --> 32:37.240]  their orders to stand down and but the police are trying to figure out how to do this right
[32:37.240 --> 32:40.840]  and not go along with this because like tucker carlson said and i've said this a thousand
[32:40.840 --> 32:50.480]  times it's totally true the social contract has been broken and you could talk a bad about
[32:50.480 --> 32:53.720]  the government all day it's good it's bad but it's it's an american government and
[32:53.720 --> 32:57.560]  it has empowered the people we have empowered ourselves with this limited structure it's
[32:57.560 --> 33:03.040]  gotten out of control and now it's being taken over by hard court criminals that are sworn
[33:03.040 --> 33:10.480]  to destroy our lives and so the status quo is private property and second amendment and
[33:10.480 --> 33:16.480]  god and country and family the star spangled banner and it's all under attack here's tucker
[33:16.480 --> 33:21.720]  carlson's report it's on info wars dot com america is witnessing a brazen power grab here
[33:21.720 --> 33:28.680]  it is after two months of rioting and political chaos there's still people out there who claim
[33:28.680 --> 33:33.840]  this is all about the death of george floyd believe it or not there are some of the people
[33:33.840 --> 33:38.080]  who say that may actually believe it we're giving them the benefit of the doubt the liberal
[33:38.080 --> 33:43.280]  mom who lives next door to you for example she's probably entirely sincere when she lectures
[33:43.280 --> 33:48.680]  you about the scourge of police brutality she means it she has no idea blm is about
[33:48.680 --> 33:55.040]  anything else we're not judging and that's not surprising most americans are nice people
[33:55.040 --> 34:00.360]  they're literal and ingenious they tend to take claims at face value because they want
[34:00.360 --> 34:06.240]  to believe the best but in this case they are wrong none of what you are watching is
[34:06.240 --> 34:12.600]  about civil rights violence and race baiting are the enemies of civil rights what you're
[34:12.600 --> 34:17.680]  watching instead is a power grab it's being coordinated by the most ruthless and cynical
[34:17.680 --> 34:22.480]  figures in american politics they don't want you to know what they're doing they're not
[34:22.480 --> 34:27.640]  honorable enough to state their intentions they're not like you at all when normal people
[34:27.640 --> 34:33.520]  want something they can be aggressive but the professional left never is it's invariably
[34:33.520 --> 34:38.800]  passive aggressive their first instinct is to manipulate rather than persuade they hide
[34:38.800 --> 34:45.160]  their real beliefs they say precisely the opposite of what they mean every time they accuse you
[34:45.160 --> 34:49.760]  of the crimes they themselves are committing it makes your head spin arguing with them
[34:49.760 --> 34:53.600]  is pointless by the way they're nihilists they don't believe in the existence of truth
[34:53.600 --> 34:59.920]  or in the fixed meaning of words they care only about power it's painful to say this
[34:59.920 --> 35:04.360]  it hurts to admit there are people in our country who are like this but there are and
[35:04.360 --> 35:08.760]  they have more power than ever if you need more evidence of that barack obama showed
[35:08.760 --> 35:13.760]  up at congressman john lewis's funeral today obama claimed he was there to eulogize his
[35:13.760 --> 35:18.640]  own friend but that's not true and that's not what he did instead obama gave a divisive
[35:18.640 --> 35:24.880]  and deeply dishonest campaign speech in church here's part of what he said by ending some
[35:24.880 --> 35:31.480]  of the partisan gerrymandering so that all voters have the power to choose their politicians
[35:31.480 --> 35:40.400]  not the other way around and if all this takes eliminating the filibuster another jim
[35:40.400 --> 35:47.120]  crow relic in order to secure the god given rights of every american then that's what
[35:47.120 --> 35:53.760]  we should do it's hard to believe that clip is real but it is down to the cloying fake
[35:53.760 --> 35:59.240]  accent mr hawaii guy but take three steps back imagine if some greasy politicians showed
[35:59.240 --> 36:04.320]  up at your loved ones funeral and started throwing around stupid partisan talking points
[36:04.320 --> 36:09.480]  about senate procedure can you imagine that you would be shocked if that happened you'd
[36:09.480 --> 36:15.080]  probably walk out desecrating a funeral with campaign slogans what kind of person would
[36:15.080 --> 36:20.760]  do that but democrats in the audience didn't seem offended they didn't blink they cheered
[36:20.760 --> 36:26.000]  it all seemed normal to them and why wouldn't it political power is their religion it's
[36:26.000 --> 36:32.400]  not out of place in a church it's what they worship people who will politicize a funeral
[36:32.400 --> 36:38.040]  will do anything and they're trying to democrats are working systematically to dismantle the
[36:38.040 --> 36:44.800]  core institutions of american life beginning with the family and with faith they're subverting
[36:44.800 --> 36:49.880]  the core system in our government the justice system they're nullifying laws burning police
[36:49.880 --> 36:55.560]  stations attacking courthouses working to eliminate the legal equality of american citizens the
[36:55.560 --> 37:00.920]  foundation of it all they've systematically repurposed federal law enforcement agencies
[37:00.920 --> 37:06.080]  as political weapons they have imprisoned their political opponents their leaders have
[37:06.080 --> 37:10.840]  called for making all of these changes permanent by packing the supreme court packing the united
[37:10.840 --> 37:16.400]  states senate packing the electorate itself by importing tens of millions of new voters
[37:16.400 --> 37:20.280]  why are they doing all of this they'll tell you it's to make the country better and more
[37:20.280 --> 37:25.960]  just but the country isn't improving and it's not fairer they're doing this for one reason
[37:25.960 --> 37:31.440]  to ensure they have complete control of the united states we're watching it happen right
[37:31.440 --> 37:38.120]  now though almost no one ever admits it and those who do come close to getting shut down
[37:38.120 --> 37:42.240]  we can tell you stories so how should the rest of us respond to what we're seeing and
[37:42.240 --> 37:45.680]  let's be clear by the rest of us we're not talking about conservatives or people who
[37:45.680 --> 37:50.760]  watch the show we're talking about literally everybody else moderates the politically
[37:50.760 --> 37:54.640]  non-aligned traditional liberals who still care about civil liberties there are some
[37:54.640 --> 37:59.880]  of those sincere religious people of all faiths immigrants from abroad who came to this country
[37:59.880 --> 38:05.780]  because of our bill of rights only to watch it evaporate once they got here in other words
[38:05.780 --> 38:11.600]  everyone who fundamentally loves this country which is still most americans what do people
[38:11.600 --> 38:17.920]  like that do in the face of this this revolution well it's simple defend the system that we
[38:17.920 --> 38:25.240]  have that's our job the american system is flawed no one doubts that but it works better
[38:25.240 --> 38:30.680]  than any other system in history and tearing it down will not help in fact it will benefit
[38:30.680 --> 38:36.560]  only a few the ones pushing for it and it will crush millions so if you care about the
[38:36.560 --> 38:41.520]  united states fight for its institutions they have served us well this country has survived
[38:41.520 --> 38:48.040]  almost 250 years through a civil war the full video is on info wars dot com and what what
[38:48.040 --> 38:52.680]  he's saying is totally true do process gets in the way of apple in google with their slave
[38:52.680 --> 38:59.320]  camps in china it gets in the way of of the power elite and world government and that's
[38:59.320 --> 39:04.120]  why everything decent and orderly and and that's been proven and was the apple of the
[39:04.120 --> 39:08.080]  eye that everybody wanted people that didn't live under this they wanted to come here not
[39:08.080 --> 39:11.120]  because it was perfect because it was way better than what they experienced they could
[39:11.120 --> 39:17.480]  come here and live their dreams and now there's the paradox though of incredible liberty creates
[39:17.480 --> 39:22.600]  incredible wealth and it creates incredible decadence and the cycle goes into decline
[39:22.600 --> 39:26.320]  and then people forget what made us great and then the scammers come in and brainwash
[39:26.320 --> 39:30.520]  people and then they go along with hey let's just have a communist or fashion system and
[39:30.520 --> 39:37.240]  it'll all be free and of course they really all become slaves overnight and people say
[39:37.240 --> 39:41.040]  well why are they making this movie they'll never win they've won everywhere else but
[39:41.040 --> 39:46.480]  here that's why soros is doing this he's never been held accountable he thinks he's
[39:46.480 --> 39:54.360]  gonna win one way or the other now I say we pray for his destruction I have never been

[55:38.200 --> 55:41.920]  store it for shipping double patriot points take advantage of it right now while there's
[55:41.920 --> 55:49.160]  still time whether you believe in evolution in the modern theory or not the globalist
[55:49.160 --> 55:54.960]  controllers do and they constantly write about and talk about how they want to create a global
[55:54.960 --> 56:01.720]  crisis or a group of crises that forced humans to quote evolve in a new better way that when
[56:01.720 --> 56:06.240]  you study how they actually what you'd evolve you believe in that it is to stop having children
[56:06.240 --> 56:11.800]  emerge with silicon bodies and a post human future talk about psychotic talk about creepy
[56:11.800 --> 56:18.160]  talk about crazy but they need an event like COVID-19 to teach a mammal to wear some covering
[56:18.160 --> 56:23.840]  over its nose over its breathing tubes to set the precedent for the forced inoculations
[56:23.840 --> 56:29.480]  for the GMO for the 5g and for all the things that they admit will end our humanity as we
[56:29.480 --> 56:35.720]  know it that's why this is so evil their whole agenda for a cashless society global government
[56:35.720 --> 56:40.960]  you in control getting us all into debt getting rid of local government think about all the
[56:40.960 --> 57:03.920]  facts and some of the censorship the surveillance you're listening to the alex jones show
[57:03.920 --> 57:08.440]  all right we actually went out and hired a well known statistician we didn't put his
[57:08.440 --> 57:13.080]  name in it because he was targeted one time we did stuff for us before so just look at
[57:13.080 --> 57:17.320]  the CDC's own numbers we're gonna cover the giant hoax there's COVID-19 we're not saying
[57:17.320 --> 57:20.360]  it's not a real virus I'm saying it doesn't kill some people but the way they've handled
[57:20.360 --> 57:26.200]  it and exacerbated it and hyped it up as a sign to shut the economy down that is all
[57:26.200 --> 57:31.720]  coming up but let's talk about Herman Cain who died yesterday you know he had liver cancer
[57:31.720 --> 57:37.200]  he had bowel cancer he had a bunch of cancers he was really sick I don't know that know
[57:37.200 --> 57:43.600]  him well and he died of pneumonia but they're saying COVID-19 did he really die of the ventilator
[57:43.600 --> 57:48.000]  that's the question we asked the reports at man dot video here it is Herman Cain killed
[57:48.000 --> 57:57.880]  by COVID-19 or like so many others was he killed by the ventilator we just received the sad
[57:57.880 --> 58:04.040]  news on this Thursday morning that Herman Cain CEO popular talk show host former presidential
[58:04.040 --> 58:11.200]  republican candidate has died and we're told in the headlines he died of COVID-19 but read
[58:11.200 --> 58:16.920]  the fine print here are the facts that we know right now upwards of 90% of people who
[58:16.920 --> 58:22.800]  are put on ventilators with COVID-19 end up dying and for at least five months most of
[58:22.800 --> 58:26.800]  the top scientists and doctors have said you should not be put on a ventilator you should
[58:26.800 --> 58:31.520]  be given steroids to cause inflammation to go down because people are having an auto
[58:31.520 --> 58:36.680]  immune response as soon as I heard he died I began to read and watch what was happening
[58:36.680 --> 58:41.800]  and they announced within an hour that indeed ladies and gentlemen he'd been put on a ventilator
[58:41.800 --> 58:46.640]  and that he died on a ventilator also Herman Cain was 74 years of age Herman Cain had a
[58:46.640 --> 58:50.080]  lot of underlying health conditions I know that because I know some of the people that
[58:50.080 --> 58:55.040]  were involved in Neil Borts and his production crew years ago when they co-hosted shows and
[58:55.040 --> 58:58.960]  he could also see in the last few speeches he gave that he was very very frail and wasn't
[58:58.960 --> 59:03.840]  as strong as he had once been he was still a work of hauling so again we were told that
[59:03.840 --> 59:08.720]  2.5 million people would be dead by now it's actually 150,000 and most of those are people
[59:08.720 --> 59:13.760]  that died of gunshot wounds, car wrecks, motorcycle accidents, skydiving accidents and yes even
[59:13.760 --> 59:19.040]  shark attacks in this case he's a 70-something-year-old man who already had pre-existing health conditions
[59:19.040 --> 59:23.280]  he tested positive for COVID-19 now that doesn't even mean he had COVID-19 most of the tests
[59:23.280 --> 59:27.880]  it turns out are false you've had a cold or the flu no last few years it shows up as
[59:27.880 --> 59:33.000]  a false positive as well they just said 600,000 members the military had COVID it was a
[59:33.000 --> 59:38.040]  accounting error they're doing everything they can to push up these numbers and Herman Cain
[59:38.040 --> 59:42.360]  wanted to reopen the economy Herman Cain supported presidents for up having his rallies again
[59:42.360 --> 59:45.320]  and they're trying to say that because he went to the Tulsa rally that's where he got COVID-19
[59:45.320 --> 59:51.560]  with no evidence Herman Cain's death should not be used to keep America shut down the UN admits
[59:51.560 --> 59:55.480]  millions of people are on the edge of starvation and already starving because when the first
[59:55.480 --> 1:00:00.600]  world shuts down the third world dies ladies and gentlemen Herman Cain was for opening economy
[1:00:00.600 --> 1:00:05.560]  we should not let the leftist and the globalist and Bill Gates use his death to keep things locked
[1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:10.040]  down it's all about politics it's about getting Trump out of office it's about getting us further
[1:00:10.040 --> 1:00:14.360]  into debt it's about the whole surveillance state it's about forced inoculations and digital
[1:00:14.920 --> 1:00:19.320]  microchips they inject into you to prove you've been inoculated after denying it for months
[1:00:19.320 --> 1:00:22.600]  Bill Gates has now come out and admitted through his foundation that indeed they want you to take
[1:00:22.600 --> 1:00:27.320]  a microchip be able to travel an airplane or have a job ladies and gentlemen the new order
[1:00:27.320 --> 1:00:33.400]  tyranny isn't coming it's here i really liked Herman Cain he was a very positive very friendly
[1:00:33.400 --> 1:00:38.280]  guy and most of talk radio is very negative very warlike including myself because that's what it
[1:00:38.280 --> 1:00:43.880]  takes to win this fight but he was able with humor and incredible wit to really do a great job and
[1:00:43.880 --> 1:00:47.720]  i thought he did a better job than Neil Boertz on Neil Boertz's program so again i'm very very
[1:00:47.720 --> 1:00:52.680]  sad to hear that Herman Cain who i had a chance to meet at the RNC in 2006 is dead he's one of the
[1:00:52.680 --> 1:00:56.760]  best political minds we have i disagree with him on quite a few things but overall he was a great
[1:00:56.760 --> 1:01:02.680]  american he'll be sorely missed don't let these ghouls use his death to kill america kill our
[1:01:02.680 --> 1:01:08.600]  economy and kill the third world reopen america now arrest Fauci and Bill Gates for crimes against
[1:01:08.600 --> 1:01:13.320]  humanity for insider trading and for lying to people and sending sick people to nursing homes
[1:01:13.320 --> 1:01:17.960]  so that actually get some real death numbers and don't ever forget almost everyone that's put on one
[1:01:17.960 --> 1:01:22.440]  of these breathing machines dies normally that saves somebody with pneumonia but this virus is
[1:01:22.440 --> 1:01:26.840]  different it's an autoimmune response so warn your family and warn others the most dangerous
[1:01:26.840 --> 1:01:31.720]  place for them to be is in a hospital not just during covid 19 upwards of a half million americans
[1:01:31.720 --> 1:01:37.080]  die a year of medical malpractice that's not even counting the other 300 000 that die from flesh
[1:01:37.080 --> 1:01:42.360]  eating bacteria and other infections in hospitals the most dangerous place in the world is in a

[1:04:25.480 --> 1:04:29.240]  with us so we're not putting his name on it this time but we already knew these numbers we thought
[1:04:29.240 --> 1:04:35.800]  we'd get a you know degreed phd statistician to come and look at the numbers all over the country
[1:04:35.800 --> 1:04:41.400]  where they take the flu and the other deaths and they put it in the covet 19 column and we've done
[1:04:41.400 --> 1:04:47.160]  it it's an ad on sell us our article on infowarstore.com skandemic cdc stats show flu deaths dropped
[1:04:47.160 --> 1:04:53.240]  as covet deaths increased data shows agency categorizing deaths from common flu as covet
[1:04:53.240 --> 1:04:59.400]  deaths that's the article we'll get to it in a moment but first a big zero hedge article that
[1:04:59.400 --> 1:05:07.480]  links to mainstream news abc you name it ohio withdraws ban on hydroxychloroquine
[1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:15.320]  fouchy accused of misinformation campaign now imagine saying tylenol doesn't help headaches
[1:05:15.320 --> 1:05:20.040]  i mean everybody knows that's not true or or ibuprofen doesn't help inflammation and joints
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:27.160]  hydroxychloroquine goes back to quinine it was used by the Aztecs a thousand years ago the dutch
[1:05:27.160 --> 1:05:32.840]  found out about it from the spanish 400 years ago i mean this is it kills malaria okay it's an
[1:05:32.840 --> 1:05:38.520]  antiviral it's established it's ridiculous but if you're fouchy with res denovir or whatever
[1:05:38.520 --> 1:05:42.440]  for two thousand dollars a dose you don't want that because he owns part of it and he's got the
[1:05:42.440 --> 1:05:49.480]  patents on the drugs so this article lays out how the governor now of ohio came out and said
[1:05:49.480 --> 1:05:54.920]  executive order you can now prescribe it you could before they put orders in saying you couldn't
[1:05:55.960 --> 1:06:02.680]  and imagine medical doctors have press conferences and they are being shut down they're being told
[1:06:02.680 --> 1:06:06.520]  they can't do it and in some cases fired now let's turn your mic on yeah they're being they're
[1:06:06.520 --> 1:06:10.840]  being fired too alex some of these uh nurses our doctors some of these doctors are being fired
[1:06:10.840 --> 1:06:16.680]  that's right because it's all intimidation so researchers retract botched anti-hydroxychloroquine
[1:06:16.680 --> 1:06:22.520]  study which was used to attack trump that was happened two months ago so that the un uses a
[1:06:22.520 --> 1:06:30.200]  botch study paid for by fouchy and and and and and and and gates to say that it doesn't help you
[1:06:30.200 --> 1:06:35.640]  that was a lie and they're still doing that they got criminal they took veterans who were dying alex
[1:06:35.640 --> 1:06:39.480]  and and gave them hydroxychloroquine like oh well they died well they were already dying they were
[1:06:39.480 --> 1:06:44.120]  already on deathbed they should have given it to them exactly gates funded hydroxychloroquine studies
[1:06:44.120 --> 1:06:49.160]  are designed to kill people researchers retract botched hydroxychloroquine study which was used
[1:06:49.160 --> 1:06:54.680]  to attack trump coronavirus influential study of hydroxychloroquine was drawn the lands that
[1:06:54.680 --> 1:07:00.680]  retracts large study hydroxychloroquine so meanwhile video trump defends viral hydroxychloroquine
[1:07:00.680 --> 1:07:06.120]  doctor says i thought she was very impressive meanwhile ladies and gentlemen they're trying
[1:07:06.120 --> 1:07:12.680]  to shut anybody down that puts this out including donald trump jr so it's alex jones two years ago
[1:07:12.680 --> 1:07:22.360]  now it's medical doctors in a press conference and fouchy goes on tv rob do and says yesterday i agree
[1:07:22.360 --> 1:07:27.000]  don't let doctors have speech this is beyond the soviet union and the head of youtube admitted
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:33.080]  it he said hey it doesn't follow cdc un head guidelines so we just ban them we we don't
[1:07:33.080 --> 1:07:38.360]  let doctors who've been practicing that's what you practice medicine they've been practicing medicine
[1:07:38.360 --> 1:07:43.000]  having results with hydroxychloroquine but this is a we can't establish antiviral known oh yeah
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:46.840]  they've been using it for years and the doctor it's like saying brush your teeth and get rid of
[1:07:46.840 --> 1:07:51.080]  cavities and the doctor who is talking about this black lady she's from nigeria she's been using
[1:07:51.080 --> 1:07:55.160]  hydroxychloroquine for years to treat people with malaria she knows how it works plenty of other
[1:07:55.160 --> 1:07:59.720]  doctors have come out and said hey there's no problem with it even dr drew the tv doctor said
[1:07:59.720 --> 1:08:02.680]  i prescribe it all the time i've never had any problems with it because they were talking about
[1:08:02.680 --> 1:08:06.280]  the heart problems he goes i've never seen anyone with heart they've had all these doctors come out
[1:08:06.280 --> 1:08:12.120]  and say i've got a thousand patients i got 300 patients i got it's a fact it's like saying electricity
[1:08:12.120 --> 1:08:17.960]  comes out of a light socket i mean they are literally gas what let me ask this for you know
[1:08:17.960 --> 1:08:26.520]  these these the study that we paid for and the huge news why are they skipping animal trials
[1:08:26.520 --> 1:08:32.280]  why are they admitting that 100 of people have side effects on the vaccine 20 or hospitalized
[1:08:32.280 --> 1:08:36.600]  like they just don't care they're just doing it they're skipping animal trials because then they
[1:08:36.600 --> 1:08:41.800]  don't have to what they have is a they'll do a third another study after they inject you with it
[1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:46.120]  you know if our human trial it goes up to here and then with the animal trial they go one step
[1:08:46.120 --> 1:08:51.640]  further where they can put the virus into the animal and see how it reacts 100 the first guy
[1:08:51.640 --> 1:08:55.640]  exactly well with the old coronavirus because they've been trying to get coronavirus vaccines
[1:08:55.640 --> 1:08:59.640]  for years that's a big that's supposedly never gonna release a coronavirus as soon as they got it
[1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:05.320]  exactly and and now it's what an RNA vaccine that's going to rewrite your dna they're like this is
[1:09:05.320 --> 1:09:10.920]  okay on it a weaponized yeah they always the holy grail was a weaponized comical right because it
[1:09:10.920 --> 1:09:15.960]  spreads fast and and and then you know some people really get it and they'll really they'll die off
[1:09:15.960 --> 1:09:20.600]  and it gets rid of uh i guess the people who are older who have comorbidities because that's what
[1:09:20.600 --> 1:09:25.240]  we're seeing we're seeing a lot of people die from this yeah the average age is like 82 they're 82
[1:09:25.240 --> 1:09:28.680]  and they have all these other problems they have diabetes they have high blood pressure they have
[1:09:28.680 --> 1:09:33.640]  cancer all kinds of things and and this is gates who says i want to kill old people yeah and then
[1:09:33.640 --> 1:09:38.440]  he cooks up at wuhan on record him and fouchy something that kills old people and i love how
[1:09:38.440 --> 1:09:42.520]  they he goes on tv he goes i'm not involved and the whole internet goes and finds all the clips of
[1:09:42.520 --> 1:09:48.280]  him yeah how much trouble is gates in though well you could tell uh when even laura noro donald asked
[1:09:48.280 --> 1:09:54.360]  him about the the side effects and the adverse reactions and he starts uh uh he can't get his
[1:09:54.360 --> 1:09:59.080]  words out because well the fda old did they'll do it they'll do it they're the gold standard
[1:09:59.080 --> 1:10:03.240]  and yeah there it is right there i mean he really and he's talking about the severe pain in the arm
[1:10:03.240 --> 1:10:08.680]  and he's rubbing his arm it's just severe pain but 20 percent had to be put on ventilators they had
[1:10:08.680 --> 1:10:12.920]  to be put in hospitals oh yeah and they're not can you they're gonna try to give millions of people
[1:10:12.920 --> 1:10:18.600]  this this is actually psychos destroying themselves i actually i don't want people to die but i kind of
[1:10:18.600 --> 1:10:23.160]  like they want to normalize everybody you imagine when they start giving the vaccine how they're
[1:10:23.160 --> 1:10:27.160]  gonna try to cover up the deaths oh totally you had the guy come out who was in the trial and said
[1:10:27.160 --> 1:10:30.680]  i went home and i had the i had the worst fever i felt horrible but i still think people should
[1:10:30.680 --> 1:10:35.240]  take the vaccine i mean that's how crazy these people are they've been brainwashed into believing
[1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:39.720]  anything that these authority figures say well that's it they're just like Aztecs come up here
[1:10:39.720 --> 1:10:43.160]  we're gonna cop chop your heart out and use some more triple i'm chopping yeah like okay this is
[1:10:43.160 --> 1:10:47.240]  like they can't we can't cover up the vaccines are hurting people we'll just get people to accept
[1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:51.800]  yeah they've accepted it with the mass now they're gonna try this goggle thing that's that you know

[1:12:09.880 --> 1:12:14.440]  no hey nobody above a certain level is taking think about what a psycho he is though his whole

[1:12:49.080 --> 1:12:54.520]  the global initiative with the contact tracers yeah the bbc estate run media in the uk and then
[1:12:54.520 --> 1:13:01.160]  come out with a detailed article it's linked to an info wars dot com saying you will have to have
[1:13:01.160 --> 1:13:07.960]  forced inoculations multiple times a year to be able to travel robots will scan you when you land
[1:13:07.960 --> 1:13:13.160]  you'll have a digital tattoo under your skin to be able to enter the country but it's gonna be so
[1:13:13.160 --> 1:13:18.760]  easy and so cool and so fun the microsoft website now officially has announced the digital tattoo
[1:13:19.400 --> 1:13:23.880]  we exposed this six months ago now bill gates was funding it they had hundreds of news articles
[1:13:23.880 --> 1:13:29.080]  attacking and saying it wasn't true this is a tactic they use first they announce it we say it's
[1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:33.400]  a bad idea they say that's crazy we didn't do it they introduced the idea to you then they come
[1:13:33.400 --> 1:13:39.240]  back and announce it again thinking you have no memory this is a criminal takeover this is the
[1:13:39.240 --> 1:13:46.200]  line in the sand we must say no we must expose the fraud of covet 19 this entire house of evil
[1:13:46.200 --> 1:13:52.040]  is built on i'm alex jones never surrendered a tyranny info wars dot com the reasons that the
[1:13:52.040 --> 1:13:57.960]  globalist launch this planetary lockdown the number one reason is it serves every one of their
[1:13:57.960 --> 1:14:05.400]  purposes we've gone over those purposes many times here on air the casual society the surveillance
[1:14:05.400 --> 1:14:11.640]  system global government medical tyranny forced inoculation but the most important facet is it
[1:14:11.640 --> 1:14:19.560]  teaches us that we are obsolete that we are non-essential as we begin to witness automation
[1:14:19.560 --> 1:14:26.920]  computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had by design this isn't like it's some
[1:14:26.920 --> 1:14:33.640]  advancement that we just fell into it's been pre-planned organized globally and it's extremely
[1:14:33.640 --> 1:14:40.520]  predatory and through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations the central banks that
[1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:47.640]  control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power this is the truest
[1:14:47.640 --> 1:14:56.680]  is the truest form of technocracy fascism you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:14:56.680 --> 1:15:07.640]  so
[1:15:07.640 --> 1:15:19.640]  iris jones
[1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:28.600]  these great-grandchildren believe you could live to 103 103 is forever when you're just a little
[1:15:28.600 --> 1:15:40.200]  kid so silas jones live forever brave digger we are back live ladies and gentlemen all right so
[1:15:40.200 --> 1:15:44.760]  we went out we hired a statistician to come up with the numbers the stories on info wars
[1:15:44.760 --> 1:15:51.080]  dot com is in the zone don salazar story scandemic cdc stat show flu deaths dropped as coveted
[1:15:51.080 --> 1:15:57.640]  deaths increased this is life saving to get this information to get it out to doctors hospitals
[1:15:57.640 --> 1:16:02.920]  you name it we looked at a whole bunch of states and found what people were saying six months ago
[1:16:02.920 --> 1:16:07.560]  five months ago was true they're counting all the flu deaths you name it in the same column
[1:16:07.560 --> 1:16:11.800]  so rob news here you have the statistician to go over this stories on info wars
[1:16:11.800 --> 1:16:15.240]  the starts out with arizona let's walk through this yeah and i had him look at the hot spot
[1:16:15.240 --> 1:16:20.120]  state so arizona florida michigan uh texas those are all florida that's where they said this is
[1:16:20.120 --> 1:16:24.440]  where it's all happening so if you look and you can see uh you have the flu deaths here
[1:16:24.440 --> 1:16:29.080]  going up to 16 so not that many that's per day these are deaths per day uh and then this is
[1:16:29.080 --> 1:16:33.560]  actually the flu is the blue line the coveted deaths you can see the number it's 140 it almost
[1:16:33.560 --> 1:16:39.480]  gets to 140 a day at one point but you can see how as the flu goes down ah covet's magically taking
[1:16:39.480 --> 1:16:45.320]  its place and and in graphic after graphic it's the exact same signature yeah it's just a computer
[1:16:45.320 --> 1:16:50.360]  change exactly which they admit they're counting flu as the death but here's the numbers there's
[1:16:50.360 --> 1:16:54.840]  the numbers and then if you look at pneumonia pneumonia follows almost the same path as covet
[1:16:54.840 --> 1:17:00.200]  almost the same number so i've got him doing pneumonia deaths next comparing that with uh
[1:17:00.200 --> 1:17:03.880]  with the covet because he's got to get all this data put it all in and it took him all to gather
[1:17:03.880 --> 1:17:07.480]  the data now we're going to start seeing graphs spit out which is going to be great i can't wait
[1:17:07.480 --> 1:17:12.120]  to see how these numbers line up we i've also got him looking at uh pneumonia deaths throughout the
[1:17:12.120 --> 1:17:16.760]  years to see if there's a big change in these in these states we're looking at these specific
[1:17:16.760 --> 1:17:22.040]  states now i think next we go and look at states that didn't have lockdowns and see what the numbers
[1:17:22.040 --> 1:17:26.360]  are because i think you're going to see totally different ads of that exactly there wasn't the
[1:17:26.360 --> 1:17:30.520]  manipulation going on so you're seeing that meanwhile new york will not release data because
[1:17:30.520 --> 1:17:33.960]  they're they're running the he was looking at new york he goes i can't make sense of it none of it
[1:17:33.960 --> 1:17:38.280]  makes sense he's like it's different in different places so he we kind of excluded new york even
[1:17:38.280 --> 1:17:41.720]  though new york was one of the ones i said we need to look at that but he goes i can't make sense of
[1:17:41.720 --> 1:17:45.240]  this and you could well because they know what they're doing there they're covering up well yeah
[1:17:45.240 --> 1:17:49.480]  i mean new york's old school mobsters they know how to manipulate data uh they know they know what
[1:17:49.480 --> 1:17:52.680]  they're doing to get the money because that's what it's all about at the end of the day the more
[1:17:52.680 --> 1:17:57.880]  covid patients 50 000 for everybody you put a tube in and kill you like hang johnson said money
[1:17:57.880 --> 1:18:02.440]  so let's go to california and you can see california almost the same signature but you've got
[1:18:02.440 --> 1:18:07.640]  you know maybe 10 times more almost 10 times more covid deaths and flu deaths but it's like
[1:18:07.640 --> 1:18:13.800]  here we got the dip and we had the dip and then as these go down these go up it's really weird they
[1:18:13.800 --> 1:18:18.120]  just manipulate they put it out just put it out a few weeks and drop the number or raise the number
[1:18:18.120 --> 1:18:22.120]  up and that's what we're going to crazy as it matches like they cut off the they cut off the
[1:18:22.120 --> 1:18:25.960]  flu and then the same signature of what it would have done is the same deal and then you almost
[1:18:25.960 --> 1:18:31.000]  have the same thing with pneumonia if you look at these with multiple causes of death which is the
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:36.120]  comorbidities and then the underlying and so look at it they match they met it's crazy it's really
[1:18:36.120 --> 1:18:40.760]  crazy what they've done i'll pull this down so you can see pneumonia and they kind of do the same
[1:18:40.760 --> 1:18:45.720]  thing and then flu is almost the exact same thing it's like they've they've just reminipulated the
[1:18:45.720 --> 1:18:51.000]  data and added a bunch more deaths to her you know they're being extremely lazy they are and you
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:55.080]  know it's i think as part of the point is it's all fake but it's you know the fraction that we've
[1:18:55.080 --> 1:18:59.640]  talked about this election uh metal fraction magic yeah we're just gonna move make these little
[1:18:59.640 --> 1:19:03.240]  maneuvers right here and you're not going to see them because it's not whole numbers it's fraction
[1:19:03.240 --> 1:19:09.640]  so you know you never it's hard to find the the i i guess the signature but here you go
[1:19:09.640 --> 1:19:15.560]  same thing in florida big scoop goes down big scoop goes down and then they cross each other
[1:19:15.560 --> 1:19:20.920]  as one's going down one starts going up i mean it's it's comical when you look at it talk about
[1:19:20.920 --> 1:19:26.200]  a double cross there it is that's what yeah there you and it's in every every state does the same
[1:19:26.200 --> 1:19:32.200]  thing here's texas so you know we've we've seen texas going up and down and crazy but robert's
[1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:38.040]  crazy is they admit they're adding regular deaths to it so it's not like it's even our opinion we
[1:19:38.040 --> 1:19:42.440]  just have graphs showing it's just like my god michigan state senator dr jensen came out and
[1:19:42.440 --> 1:19:46.840]  then they they investigated him for saying what they told him to do he went out and said hey they're
[1:19:46.840 --> 1:19:51.000]  telling us if we suspect it's covid you could put covid on the death certificate he goes well i've
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:54.760]  never heard of that so i had to want to go out and talk to him now he's got an ethics investigation
[1:19:54.760 --> 1:19:59.480]  he's got it well they just ended it but it took him he was under this other doctor for being in
[1:19:59.480 --> 1:20:03.240]  the press conference saying oh yeah she gets saying hydroxychloric and help my patients she's fired
[1:20:03.240 --> 1:20:08.120]  yeah exactly and then the other one gets tarred and feathered through the uh through the media
[1:20:08.120 --> 1:20:12.120]  because the bureaucracy we don't care about your degree or your patience or your proof
[1:20:12.120 --> 1:20:16.120]  we're the insurance companies we're the bankers we say what reality we care about the numbers
[1:20:16.120 --> 1:20:20.920]  and we care about i mean let's look at this what who's funded by the major news media it's a big
[1:20:20.920 --> 1:20:25.960]  pharma so they're working hand in hand on this and hey we got to promote remdesivir okay cool
[1:20:25.960 --> 1:20:30.440]  we're on that there's a total we got to go against yeah we got to go against hydroxychloric
[1:20:30.440 --> 1:20:35.400]  we have to have a law where you can't have these these drug companies but i imagine remdesivir
[1:20:35.400 --> 1:20:40.600]  in their fake study had an eight percent increase in life and it turns out actually probably kills
[1:20:40.600 --> 1:20:44.760]  you in the other studies but then something that has a nine nine percent success rate that's cheap
[1:20:44.760 --> 1:20:49.160]  oh we got to crush that i mean this is murder oh it's total murder and then we had the the doctor
[1:20:49.160 --> 1:20:54.520]  out in west texas with butesidine he was the inhaler steroid yeah he's he said hey this is
[1:20:54.520 --> 1:20:58.760]  working with all my patients like oh no we can't we got to drag this guy through the mud anybody
[1:20:58.760 --> 1:21:03.400]  who comes out with anything that works it's like folks it's only because they're murdering everybody
[1:21:03.400 --> 1:21:06.840]  and and in the end of the day it's all going to pan out yeah look at these other these other
[1:21:06.840 --> 1:21:13.160]  here's michigan here this is from dr dr jensen came out look it matches perfectly the pneumonia
[1:21:13.160 --> 1:21:18.280]  almost to the week um in that but then you have the same thing a big rise here i guess this is
[1:21:18.280 --> 1:21:23.160]  when they started killing the old people here but they still have the same peak and then it drops
[1:21:23.160 --> 1:21:28.680]  down almost the same way it's weird how this stuff works when you start looking at the numbers and
[1:21:28.680 --> 1:21:34.040]  then you have in texas where we have them on video saying we're going to count one person
[1:21:34.040 --> 1:21:38.040]  we're going to multiply that or we're going to add 15 to that every time we get one case and that's
[1:21:38.040 --> 1:21:42.600]  why people all over the country because the nih still runs even if trump had to shut them off
[1:21:44.040 --> 1:21:47.720]  if one person gets it they count 15 more that's why you never even been to the doctor you get a
[1:21:47.720 --> 1:21:52.120]  letter you have COVID-19 exactly because somebody near you had it some people were getting positive
[1:21:52.120 --> 1:21:56.040]  and negatives in the same debt they're getting them sent you got it oh no you don't have it
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:02.680]  and they never went and took it no because the computer says somebody you were around had it
[1:22:02.680 --> 1:22:08.200]  it was also a fake positive right and we're trying so what this is is just the globalist just said
[1:22:08.200 --> 1:22:12.840]  hey take the gloves off people are awake to us just use medical system it's trusted hammer them
[1:22:12.840 --> 1:22:16.280]  with this info and just ban people ban people when they speak up you notice they're getting a lot
[1:22:16.280 --> 1:22:20.680]  quicker at banning people it barely took them 24 hours to pull that nurse press coverage which is
[1:22:20.680 --> 1:22:25.880]  like a 10 minute video off yeah notice it was a big deal when they banned me and now it's just like
[1:22:25.880 --> 1:22:31.720]  add no doctors if the UN doesn't approve it you can't talk exactly i mean we're under UN control
[1:22:31.720 --> 1:22:36.360]  folks and these are instead if it's not you and approve it i can go on the internet i i just found
[1:22:36.360 --> 1:22:41.000]  a they did a six hour summit i found part one you can't find part two anywhere but i'm going to go
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:45.800]  put that up today that's going to be three hours of these doctors and having long discussions with
[1:22:45.800 --> 1:22:50.760]  each other uh even dr erickson the one of the first doctors to get banned off youtube is is in
[1:22:50.760 --> 1:22:54.600]  with this group so these are let's expand all over the country we should create a segment that's at
[1:22:54.600 --> 1:22:59.320]  banned on video called banned medical videos well we have one called uh banned by globalists i think
[1:22:59.320 --> 1:23:03.080]  it's called censored by globalists is the channel that we created and it's got most of this medical
[1:23:03.080 --> 1:23:07.640]  information because i mean that's why we have people ask them how are you taking being banned
[1:23:07.640 --> 1:23:10.760]  i'm like they're coming for you next what do you think i'm taking this i mean now they're banned
[1:23:10.760 --> 1:23:15.080]  in doctors like it's like in world war two like german bombers are bombing britain they bomb my
[1:23:15.080 --> 1:23:18.680]  business you oh we're so sorry for you like they're coming back tomorrow to bomb you yeah exactly i
[1:23:18.680 --> 1:23:22.760]  mean i don't even know what these people are thinking here it's like we're under globalist attack
[1:23:22.760 --> 1:23:26.200]  where doctors can't even tell you what's happening with their patient they're not thinking they're
[1:23:26.200 --> 1:23:30.440]  reacting and it's so much information's coming at them all they do is react react react and they
[1:23:30.440 --> 1:23:34.520]  don't have time to really sit and think and they keep doing it and they keep piling it on so that's
[1:23:34.520 --> 1:23:38.920]  that's how it's happening it's no thinking it's already well the reports on info wars dot com
[1:23:38.920 --> 1:23:43.240]  only way the dog hunts as you share the links have a lot of lives folks the article we're coming out
[1:23:43.240 --> 1:23:48.920]  scandemic cdc stats show flu deaths dropped as covid deaths increased it's totally important
[1:23:48.920 --> 1:23:54.760]  there are a lot of reasons to get an alex jones plastic mask at infowarstore.com you can wear them
[1:23:54.760 --> 1:24:00.040]  out to political events you can trigger live darts but one of the biggest reasons is it's a great
[1:24:00.040 --> 1:24:06.840]  conversation starter at any costume party or at halloween but on top of that they admit that
[1:24:06.840 --> 1:24:10.840]  wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you from covid 19 or anything else
[1:24:10.840 --> 1:24:15.480]  it's total virtues signaling to show that you're prepared for the force inoculations and contact
[1:24:15.480 --> 1:24:20.840]  tracing of their openly announce it it's an active submission it's an active like putting a burqa on

[1:27:02.120 --> 1:27:08.280]  yeah here's our new single record from highwayman 2 album silver stallion
[1:27:08.280 --> 1:27:19.560]  good morning everybody this is dr. lisa coach coming to you live from tample florida where
[1:27:19.560 --> 1:27:27.880]  i continue to lead a large 8000 patient practice through the front lines of this COVID-19 pandemic
[1:27:28.920 --> 1:27:35.880]  many of you have been joining me from the beginning where my strong urge for answers
[1:27:35.880 --> 1:27:46.840]  my huge level of curiosity my constant asking of why made me feel compelled and drawn to be
[1:27:46.840 --> 1:27:54.520]  more present and more vocal during this time back in March there were extremes going on
[1:27:54.520 --> 1:28:00.840]  there were you're going to die because there's not enough ventilators and there were stay in
[1:28:00.840 --> 1:28:07.800]  your house before you infect somebody and i sat in my kitchen and said where are the people that
[1:28:07.800 --> 1:28:15.400]  are speaking to the middle which is humanity who's talking to the day-to-day people about how to
[1:28:15.400 --> 1:28:20.600]  take care of ourselves about how to go through get through this without turning into a fear
[1:28:20.600 --> 1:28:27.480]  mongering panicked mess so i felt as i analyzed that more and more that that person needed to
[1:28:27.480 --> 1:28:34.200]  be somebody on the front lines who understood internal medicine who understood how viruses work
[1:28:34.200 --> 1:28:40.600]  who treats people day in and day out with comorbid conditions i also understood that that person
[1:28:40.600 --> 1:28:48.200]  should be somebody who can take information and not get sucked into the energetic response of
[1:28:48.200 --> 1:28:55.320]  fear and panic and i felt that there was a huge integrative side to how we were going to handle
[1:28:55.320 --> 1:29:00.680]  this virus in this pandemic and that's when i decided as i was looking around for someone to
[1:29:00.680 --> 1:29:07.240]  speak that i was just as much equipped as the next person and i came out and i've tried to lead
[1:29:07.240 --> 1:29:13.320]  during this time with the best information i could get my hands on i'm going to try to make it through
[1:29:13.320 --> 1:29:21.880]  this live without getting too upset but yesterday um my colleagues were on capitol hill and and these
[1:29:21.880 --> 1:29:27.640]  people i felt the connection so deeply because they are people who love and care for patients
[1:29:27.640 --> 1:29:34.280]  just like i do and they came out and they spoke about information that has been hidden from the
[1:29:34.280 --> 1:29:41.000]  public information that i've had to go underground to find i'm not a political person i just want
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:47.240]  to heal people i want to empower people i want you to be able to take care of yourselves and live
[1:29:47.240 --> 1:29:52.760]  a life the highest potential you ever can possibly achieve and that requires the full interview at
[1:29:52.760 --> 1:29:58.680]  least with coke is at man dot video she was fired from her job after she went to that press conference
[1:29:58.680 --> 1:30:03.240]  and talked about her patients doing well with hydroxychloroquine which put zinc into the cells
[1:30:03.240 --> 1:30:08.840]  but here's dale big tree documentary filmmaker investigative journalist laying out what's really
[1:30:08.840 --> 1:30:13.560]  going on with the vaccine trials and why they've skipped the animal trials he's in studio with us
[1:30:13.560 --> 1:30:19.240]  but here's the clip multiple drug companies have been attempting to make a coronavirus vaccine
[1:30:19.240 --> 1:30:25.960]  here's what's amazing and i discovered in our research every single animal trial by all of those
[1:30:25.960 --> 1:30:31.240]  different drug companies in different approaches to a coronavirus vaccine had the same result
[1:30:31.240 --> 1:30:36.680]  in every one of the trials they used ferrets it's a popular animal i think it has a similar
[1:30:36.680 --> 1:30:42.520]  immune system of human beings they gave them their trial covid our coronavirus vaccine
[1:30:42.520 --> 1:30:47.000]  and the animals seem to be doing just fine they would have said it's safe look the animal's fine
[1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:52.200]  vaccine didn't hurt them they even checked their blood and they were having robust antibody
[1:30:52.200 --> 1:30:55.720]  production meaning it looks like it really works and they're probably all jumping in up and down
[1:30:55.720 --> 1:31:01.000]  in their laboratories but here's what happens in an animal trial you're allowed to go one step
[1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:05.240]  further than you're ethically allowed to in a human trial that's called a challenge study
[1:31:05.240 --> 1:31:10.200]  where they actually put the animal in contact with the virus can't do this with human being
[1:31:10.200 --> 1:31:15.400]  but they put the ferrets in contact with coronavirus and every single one of the trials
[1:31:15.400 --> 1:31:21.640]  had the same problem instead of the antibodies protecting the animal from the coronavirus
[1:31:21.640 --> 1:31:27.960]  the antibodies actually helped the virus attack their own immune system and it overreacted they
[1:31:27.960 --> 1:31:34.440]  had serious upper respiratory conditions organ failure what's called a cytokine storm meaning
[1:31:34.440 --> 1:31:39.720]  the immune system sent their body into inflammation and brain all over many of the animals died it
[1:31:39.720 --> 1:31:44.680]  was so catastrophic that in these trials you'll see at the end a caution that says we should be
[1:31:44.680 --> 1:31:51.000]  very careful moving forward with human trials well now we have just skipped all the animal trials
[1:31:51.000 --> 1:31:56.840]  and we're going into these small human trials that will never have the challenge study part of this
[1:31:56.840 --> 1:32:02.440]  so what i'm saying is we are rushing a vaccine that was deadly in the animal trials
[1:32:02.440 --> 1:32:10.760]  and this hit in the science fiction movie this is really happening del big tree is an award-winning
[1:32:10.760 --> 1:32:17.720]  producer of shows like doctors uh he's on emmy's for it he also has the
[1:32:18.520 --> 1:32:24.360]  woman documentary vaxed and he also has the show the higher wire del big trees with us on
[1:32:24.360 --> 1:32:30.520]  twitter del big tree thehighwire.com he's here with us right now for the next hour and 20 minutes
[1:32:30.520 --> 1:32:39.320]  or so this historical time i have to pinch myself before i go on air every day that owners of hospitals
[1:32:39.320 --> 1:32:47.400]  clinics doctors scientists epidemiologists rockefeller university scientists uh they go public
[1:32:47.400 --> 1:32:52.520]  they say basic things that are true they say hey they said 2.5 million with died 150 thousand
[1:32:52.520 --> 1:32:56.360]  they're putting people that died of audible accidents in the thing they're counting flu deaths
[1:32:56.360 --> 1:33:01.880]  is this and they get banned and now sundar pacias in congress two days ago going yeah we take orders
[1:33:01.880 --> 1:33:07.080]  from the un and if they say it's not allowed we don't do it and fouchy who's been wrong about
[1:33:07.080 --> 1:33:12.360]  everything right it is like up there on tv yesterday saying yeah we should censor doctors
[1:33:12.360 --> 1:33:16.920]  in america this feels like jump of the shark del big tree what do you think's happening i think
[1:33:16.920 --> 1:33:22.120]  it's uh one of the most outrageous moments in american history we're watching the american dream
[1:33:22.120 --> 1:33:27.400]  on fire right now as we speak i think that you have real crimes against humanity taking place
[1:33:27.400 --> 1:33:32.600]  this is nazi stuff in my mind you know or let's just let's look at his tuskegee experiment this
[1:33:32.600 --> 1:33:36.920]  is what i get asked about all the time you know we had african americans that syphilis we had a cure
[1:33:36.920 --> 1:33:41.800]  we didn't give it to them one of the tragic moments of the cdc the nih where fouchy worse well
[1:33:41.800 --> 1:33:47.640]  that's happening right now you've got hydroxychloroquine that is is being shown to be successful in
[1:33:47.640 --> 1:33:53.720]  65 studies internationally you have the ford medical center which is one of our best research
[1:33:53.720 --> 1:33:59.240]  hospitals uh that came forward after a study of six of their hospitals randomized study
[1:33:59.240 --> 1:34:05.720]  and they said half the people died uh in the uh hydroxychloroquine group then those that died
[1:34:05.720 --> 1:34:11.400]  that didn't receive it meaning we would have half the death rate had this nation used hydroxychloroquine
[1:34:11.400 --> 1:34:16.200]  and now you have you still have fouchy coming out against ford medical center he's got no
[1:34:16.200 --> 1:34:20.520]  science to push to it it's incredible and and i think honestly he's putting it all on the line
[1:34:20.520 --> 1:34:24.680]  you got a hand to the guy because now if he's wrong when we prove that he's wrong when the world
[1:34:24.680 --> 1:34:30.040]  finally says hydroxychloroquine was the cure we got to put these guys up for trial for murdering
[1:34:30.040 --> 1:34:35.080]  hundreds of thousands and never ever trial never absolutely we're not saying that i agree he's got
[1:34:35.080 --> 1:34:39.560]  hoodspot never seen yeah it's incredible i mean he is doubling down for whatever reason it is this
[1:34:39.560 --> 1:34:45.560]  agenda is so powerful i mean i've been saying all along the agenda is to force vaccinate
[1:34:45.560 --> 1:34:49.720]  every adult every person in America and now they admit it and now they're admitting right
[1:34:49.720 --> 1:34:54.680]  they're telling you you we will not let your lives go back to normal until there is a vaccine
[1:34:54.680 --> 1:34:59.720]  we are going to destroy this you know this economy and however long it takes we will not
[1:34:59.720 --> 1:35:05.320]  let your kids go back to school we will not let you have the life you had before until our vaccine
[1:35:05.320 --> 1:35:11.720]  agenda is fulfilled and and then it's an rna dna vaccine that goes in and reprograms yourself i mean
[1:35:11.720 --> 1:35:15.880]  it's terrifying really i mean it's hard to wrap your head around what's happening the moderna
[1:35:15.880 --> 1:35:20.120]  trial i mean even alex jones can't do i know i mean i'm getting the point where i'm just like
[1:35:20.120 --> 1:35:25.320]  this is even real this is even real it is it's a failed concept for decades have been working on
[1:35:25.320 --> 1:35:31.960]  mRNA vaccines but everyone in the moderna trial got sick okay everyone had an adverse reaction
[1:35:31.960 --> 1:35:36.920]  the high dose had severe adverse reactions but what's happening in their bodies alex this isn't
[1:35:36.920 --> 1:35:41.480]  a piece of a virus how we usually make a vaccine we did just put a little piece or a
[1:35:41.480 --> 1:35:45.560]  dead virus inside where your body's kind of like what is that and it reacts and maybe have a fever
[1:35:45.560 --> 1:35:50.040]  they'll say like all you know they they excuse that you're kind of getting a little like they're
[1:35:50.040 --> 1:35:55.320]  giving you the disease they're basically giving you data there's basically this data now they're
[1:35:55.320 --> 1:35:59.800]  going in and rewriting the book right they're rewriting your book why are you getting sick
[1:35:59.800 --> 1:36:04.360]  what about rewriting your book does make you sick they don't know that's what's crazy they're
[1:36:04.360 --> 1:36:09.720]  giant lab experiment it is a giant lab experiment that's failing to say well there's not long
[1:36:09.720 --> 1:36:15.000]  term events how do you know well del we always feel guilty about rats and guinea pigs being tested on
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:19.800]  you don't look like a guinea pig to me i don't either this is a this is crazy it is crazy these
[1:36:19.800 --> 1:36:24.360]  are real human beings and and look i hope they're being paid well i hope they were told right up
[1:36:24.360 --> 1:36:29.800]  front that animals died when we did this in animal trials so you are risky your life let's talk about
[1:36:29.800 --> 1:36:33.800]  that we come back we should probably pull up the cbs clip where they go 80 percent are having
[1:36:33.800 --> 1:36:39.880]  bad reactions 20 percent are going to the hospital and and it's like but it's not a problem this is
[1:36:39.880 --> 1:36:44.200]  all safe and effective they'll big trees our guests stay with us ladies and gentlemen and tell folks
[1:36:48.200 --> 1:36:56.040]  states cracking down on social gatherings says see it in because Fauci says if we don't
[1:36:56.040 --> 1:37:02.760]  we'll see further surges in coronavirus positives because they're only ramping up the testing
[1:37:02.760 --> 1:37:09.400]  because the tests have been designed at the wuhan lab it turns out to be completely fraudulent
[1:37:09.400 --> 1:37:16.280]  they cook the whole thing up offshore in a communist dictatorship with Fauci bill gates and the chai
[1:37:16.280 --> 1:37:23.160]  comms to be directed by the un as a giant planetary power grab and now it's all over the news that

[1:41:30.760 --> 1:41:37.080]  gates and the world awakening to him and his eugenics agenda and the skipping the animal
[1:41:37.080 --> 1:41:42.840]  trials and and and david not has a big article on info wars the three phases of the lies with the
[1:41:42.840 --> 1:41:48.680]  vaccine and all the huge health problems and people being paralyzed on the vaccine and they're
[1:41:48.680 --> 1:41:53.400]  just going to deploy this they're saying by december and start injecting everyone well how
[1:41:53.400 --> 1:41:57.400]  are they going to cover that up i mean amazing right you got and you got uh tony fouchy out there
[1:41:57.400 --> 1:42:01.240]  saying that well we just don't see the safety and hydroxychloroquine even though it's been
[1:42:01.240 --> 1:42:05.720]  safe for 65 years given to pregnant women that are breastfeeding that's how safe they believe
[1:42:05.720 --> 1:42:10.840]  that drug is but when we have everybody getting sick in the moderna trials uh sickness in the
[1:42:10.840 --> 1:42:16.680]  oxford trials of astrazeneca the two different top-running contenders of the vaccine they say
[1:42:16.680 --> 1:42:20.840]  fouchy says i'm not concerned about i'm not concerned about the adverse events and we're
[1:42:20.840 --> 1:42:25.000]  going to get this out to the public before we're done with all the safety trials and i've been
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:30.920]  looking at the safety trials alex you've never seen a bigger mess of webs of of hidden i mean that
[1:42:30.920 --> 1:42:37.080]  they've got all these branched on even cbs is like shocked like wait a minute uh right 80 percent
[1:42:37.080 --> 1:42:41.720]  are having bad effects 20 percent go to the hospital right i mean serious like all the fda
[1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:46.680]  they'll do a good job yeah yeah and and yeah bill gates saying well if the fda isn't pressured
[1:42:46.680 --> 1:42:51.320]  they'll do a good job by the way i just want you to know my nonprofit we put forward a petition
[1:42:51.320 --> 1:42:57.400]  to the fda demanding because we you know we've won lawsuits against cdc fda health and human services
[1:42:57.400 --> 1:43:01.000]  so they're not happy with me right now which is probably why i got kicked off of youtube
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:06.200]  but i put forward a petition demanding that the fda cannot call a vaccine safe it's not
[1:43:06.200 --> 1:43:10.520]  being compared against a saline placebo they were going to use the meningococcal vaccine as
[1:43:10.520 --> 1:43:14.520]  the saline group in the second and third phase trials two days after our demand at least now
[1:43:14.520 --> 1:43:18.600]  we have it it's going to be a saline i mean i have to thank you for my family you know i mean
[1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:22.280]  and then that's what shows that people challenge things we have an effect we have an effect we do
[1:43:22.280 --> 1:43:26.520]  and then you know we are really starting you sue when you win against government health agencies
[1:43:26.520 --> 1:43:30.760]  they have a real issue so they're changing the protocols thank god but here's the problem
[1:43:30.760 --> 1:43:35.080]  they're only going to look at you know the safety profile for a couple of months when we talk about
[1:43:35.080 --> 1:43:39.720]  the autoimmune diseases all the issues these people are getting sick on the spot fever is going to
[1:43:39.720 --> 1:43:46.200]  the hospital but we have exactly what's coming later nobody knows nobody knows obviously a dna
[1:43:46.200 --> 1:43:51.560]  vaccine that changes yourselves your dna is mutating as we speak we started with a fever and a lot of
[1:43:51.560 --> 1:43:58.040]  pain where does it end that's the question we don't know where this problem where it's obviously
[1:43:58.040 --> 1:44:03.560]  this it's like somebody's got a gun to gates's head like who what why are they doing this that's
[1:44:03.560 --> 1:44:08.840]  the case i don't know i mean i honestly don't know but what they're doing is very destructive it
[1:44:08.840 --> 1:44:14.280]  looks to me that gates is attempting to be a world power it looks to me he's taking over maybe there's
[1:44:14.280 --> 1:44:18.680]  someone beside him but i have a feeling he's saying get out of the way raw shells get out of the way
[1:44:18.680 --> 1:44:23.880]  i made the move i have silicone valley and i have all the medical establishment i'm putting this
[1:44:23.880 --> 1:44:28.840]  cabal together i know i agree because if he can reign over the world i don't know if he can put
[1:44:28.840 --> 1:44:34.360]  in our body what he wants and in minutes going to kill us he's gone and shut down every way that
[1:44:34.360 --> 1:44:39.320]  we now communicate with each other via the web or the internet or any 5g and he's going on he's
[1:44:39.320 --> 1:44:43.800]  got his fingers and all that he can control the discussion he can you know he's controlling
[1:44:43.800 --> 1:44:48.360]  government and he said i'm going to build that world government to depopulate and and that's the
[1:44:48.360 --> 1:44:53.080]  wall street journal i agree you're right he's the antichrist basically he sure seems to be if there's
[1:44:53.080 --> 1:44:57.160]  someone behind him i don't know who that is and i don't know who he does he looks like he's you
[1:44:57.160 --> 1:45:01.480]  know off the chain but no one likes him i mean this is the brilliance really no matter where he
[1:45:01.480 --> 1:45:06.440]  goes and everyone gets it everyone seems to get it africa literally they said no one in african
[1:45:06.440 --> 1:45:12.040]  history the africa literally hates bill case they get it yeah well they've been poisoned by him long
[1:45:12.040 --> 1:45:15.640]  enough yeah and they're just finally saying the world now that your cameras are on us now that you
[1:45:15.640 --> 1:45:20.680]  want to send your test vaccines into our country again well thank god for the first time in history
[1:45:20.680 --> 1:45:25.640]  phase one trials are under a microscope because of the arrogance of these drug companies saying
[1:45:25.640 --> 1:45:29.880]  we we're gonna get a vaccine we're gonna destroy your life until we get one all right well let's
[1:45:29.880 --> 1:45:35.240]  watch that this is the part of the drug you know creating process we've never seen we've never watched
[1:45:35.240 --> 1:45:39.560]  the phase one trials this is where they kill african children all over indian children all over
[1:45:39.560 --> 1:45:43.880]  the place and they don't tell us it ever happened well now every camera is poised because of the
[1:45:43.880 --> 1:45:48.680]  work that you and i we are i was going to focus on this right you know what happened last december
[1:45:48.680 --> 1:45:53.720]  they had the u n meeting two days in switzerland their own scientists said the doctors are wobbly
[1:45:53.720 --> 1:45:58.280]  we're hurting people there's no testing yep they were having a soul they doubled down with this big
[1:45:58.280 --> 1:46:02.360]  crisis that's it i think this blows up in their face i think it's blowing up in their face and i
[1:46:02.360 --> 1:46:07.480]  think this week it came to a head like we've never seen i'm calling it the cyber cyber attack on truth
[1:46:07.480 --> 1:46:13.160]  you had silicon valley just shut down silicon valley just shut down 12 doctors i know you were
[1:46:13.160 --> 1:46:18.440]  talking about this earlier but it is such a shocking it's not how much zones you lied about
[1:46:18.440 --> 1:46:24.840]  it's not it's not a asshole like david duke we don't like me as a speech it's it's doctors aren't
[1:46:24.840 --> 1:46:29.960]  allowed to speak now your front line doctors that are treating people with their own hands
[1:46:29.960 --> 1:46:34.440]  taking risking their own careers to give them a drug that obviously is controversial around the
[1:46:34.440 --> 1:46:39.640]  world and then finally stepping up and admitting to the world on camera i'm putting my license on
[1:46:39.640 --> 1:46:44.280]  the line to tell you even though i know fouchy never liked this drug has been pushing against it
[1:46:44.280 --> 1:46:49.720]  and the fda has been making it hard to get new mate fousy this god it's it's it's so evil a man who
[1:46:49.720 --> 1:46:54.440]  hasn't touched a patient in 40 years why are we listening to this guy i want to listen to people
[1:46:54.440 --> 1:46:58.760]  that are looking to the eyes of human beings that are going to live or die by the choices they're
[1:46:58.760 --> 1:47:05.000]  making and they're living yeah and they're standing there saying all of my patients are living right
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:09.720]  now you can be saved if you're in a hospital if you have a relative and they're did not here's the
[1:47:09.720 --> 1:47:14.360]  thing they don't have a treatment it's not like we like this other treatment it's literally no
[1:47:14.360 --> 1:47:18.600]  treatment or hydration and let me give you the good news though i've looked at fouchy he was really
[1:47:18.600 --> 1:47:22.520]  arrogant even two weeks ago he looked scared as hell on tv now he better be because we're coming
[1:47:22.520 --> 1:47:27.720]  after him it's over whoever now he is working for i believe bill gates and other people like him
[1:47:27.720 --> 1:47:32.280]  oh he's on the barrel puppet he's out there and they're putting him on the line and he is going
[1:47:32.280 --> 1:47:38.440]  to go down and it will not be pretty this man needs to be arrested and and simply because
[1:47:38.440 --> 1:47:42.680]  then we need to get him on the stand and say hey you want to mitigate your sentence go ahead and
[1:47:42.680 --> 1:47:47.160]  start telling us what bill gates has been up to you're on the inside that's how psychos work
[1:47:47.160 --> 1:47:51.000]  when they start getting caught like when the cops are after a psycho might kill one person a year
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:55.240]  they'll kill five in a day and they get they they get disorganized and that's what they're doing
[1:47:55.240 --> 1:48:00.520]  is they're like doubling down and going crazy you know i i met an israeli uh professor that
[1:48:00.520 --> 1:48:05.960]  investigates crime scenarios and he teaches you know the the military there and he says it's called
[1:48:05.960 --> 1:48:11.640]  a crime cyclone that it starts out as just a lie to cover up a problem but then someone hears a lot
[1:48:11.640 --> 1:48:16.280]  they're the lie breaks you got to kill somebody and now you find yourself you know in this murder
[1:48:16.280 --> 1:48:20.680]  spree because all it started out with it's out of control it's out of control and that's where
[1:48:20.680 --> 1:48:25.880]  they're at they are now out of control they're going to try and kill destroy shut down websites
[1:48:25.880 --> 1:48:31.960]  shut down youtube they don't care but it's too late they're too deep in they can't stop this
[1:48:31.960 --> 1:48:37.800]  crime spree trying to cover up what is one of the greatest most tragic mistakes i think it started
[1:48:37.800 --> 1:48:42.520]  out as a mistake in many ways i think bill gates took it beyond a mistake and said i don't care
[1:48:42.520 --> 1:48:47.400]  we're pushing forward and yeah that's why he was like hissing on tv and giggling because psychos
[1:48:47.400 --> 1:48:52.280]  do that when they've got you chained down we're not chained down asshole right we see you right
[1:48:52.280 --> 1:48:55.960]  he's doing a little celebration like these ted bundy and we're chained down in the basement
[1:48:55.960 --> 1:49:00.120]  dude we ain't chained down we are chained down now and we don't have stockholm syndrome either
[1:49:00.120 --> 1:49:03.640]  you know what i mean we're not falling in love with our pressure that's what they keep hoping for
[1:49:03.640 --> 1:49:07.640]  that they just keep you know telling us the same lies over and over you need us we you can't live
[1:49:07.640 --> 1:49:12.680]  without us that somehow by the way this is the most powerful radio i've done in 26 years it's
[1:49:12.680 --> 1:49:17.800]  the time we're in though it is now you're on fire brother right so what's coming next you know what's
[1:49:17.800 --> 1:49:22.680]  coming next i think is we are going to see these these social media companies falling apart i mean
[1:49:22.680 --> 1:49:26.440]  they're already turning on half the country oh they're scared when you come from media when you
[1:49:26.440 --> 1:49:31.000]  when i worked on cbs you never really you don't let i was it was a medical talk so i worked on
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:35.480]  you never want anything to sound republican or democrat because you just lost half the country
[1:49:35.480 --> 1:49:39.960]  when you do that i've been on air 20 the use of the meeting was pretty fair actually right they were
[1:49:39.960 --> 1:49:44.200]  caring producers now they're like demons well because you can't lose millions and mute millions of
[1:49:44.200 --> 1:49:48.840]  viewers it's all about money and now they're making choices where they're isolating they're
[1:49:48.840 --> 1:49:54.120]  driving conservatives into this vaccine discussion into the chloroquine discussion into medical
[1:49:54.120 --> 1:49:59.400]  discussion they're making it two sides but in many ways when i started this there was like 10
[1:49:59.400 --> 1:50:03.000]  15 percent of us that were really starting to question vaccines well now that they're saying
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:07.800]  well conservatives are jumping on board with this thing you just gave us 50 percent of america
[1:50:07.800 --> 1:50:11.640]  now 50 percent wait a minute oh i'm i'm thinking about the levels they have the power but they
[1:50:11.640 --> 1:50:16.920]  don't have the smarts they sure do not have the smarts they are not we have got to stop giving
[1:50:16.920 --> 1:50:21.400]  them credit for being these brilliant thinkers they're like third graders it's like watching school
[1:50:21.400 --> 1:50:26.440]  girls fight over a doll right now and in the end they're gonna tear the arms off of both of it no
[1:50:26.440 --> 1:50:30.920]  one's gonna get the doll and someone's gonna step forward that's what actually frightens me though
[1:50:30.920 --> 1:50:35.640]  is i mean gates comes out and says i don't want you to have a digital tattoo and there's 100 articles
[1:50:35.640 --> 1:50:39.160]  that day where his company's pushing it right and people go look at that and they go
[1:50:39.800 --> 1:50:44.760]  microsoft's front page says i get a digital tattoo to travel he says it's not true right
[1:50:44.760 --> 1:50:51.080]  you're on camera we can rewind now this is you know we didn't get this message by the pony express
[1:50:51.080 --> 1:50:57.240]  we can't say that it was written by somebody else you are on camera saying these things a history of
[1:50:57.240 --> 1:51:03.080]  you saying these things how many times has bill gates said i want to reduce the population and
[1:51:03.080 --> 1:51:08.040]  yet they say don't big tree spreads misinformation by saying there's a deep and now he wants to put
[1:51:08.040 --> 1:51:13.480]  something in my body agenda i agree it i'm telling you it's the that's what they say what you said
[1:51:13.480 --> 1:51:17.640]  to the criminology psychos at the end destroy themselves they do they and that's what we're
[1:51:17.640 --> 1:51:22.120]  watching right now in many ways and you got to feed them right just keep feeding them energy
[1:51:22.120 --> 1:51:26.680]  right now go ahead you know that's why i love it you're fighting me you're gonna take me on let's
[1:51:26.680 --> 1:51:31.320]  do not agree that's why i prod them and attack them that's right that's right make them swing even
[1:51:31.320 --> 1:51:35.560]  wilder you know it's like that you know you want to bully just make them swing wild oh my god
[1:51:37.880 --> 1:51:45.000]  americans have had freedom for so long and most americans were born into such docile times compared
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:50.600]  to the rest of history that we really have a blind spot for tyranny we don't appreciate the american way
[1:51:50.600 --> 1:51:55.720]  truth justice due process the right to self-defense private property because we've had it so long and
[1:51:55.720 --> 1:52:00.360]  we just think that's how the rest of the world is ladies and gentlemen the renaissance the social
[1:52:00.360 --> 1:52:06.200]  contract that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try
[1:52:06.200 --> 1:52:11.400]  to empower the weak as well as the strong is something the west invented and that's what made
[1:52:11.400 --> 1:52:16.600]  our modern world that's now been hijacked by the technocrats by the globalists who say humans are
[1:52:16.600 --> 1:52:22.520]  ugly and bad for the earth and we need to be cold and dumbed down and put into subgroups that the
[1:52:22.520 --> 1:52:27.560]  elites dominate manipulate and command you were even lucky enough to stay alive and that's what
[1:52:27.560 --> 1:52:34.760]  covet 19 is a global un revolution against free humanity against your family against prosperity

[1:54:35.400 --> 1:54:41.240]  not we're not losers we're overcomers yeah well and every you know i had a friend that reached out
[1:54:41.240 --> 1:54:45.080]  said i'm you know i'm i'm sorry about hearing what happened youtube and i had a lot of friends
[1:54:45.080 --> 1:54:49.880]  online that were complaining says i've known del for a really long time and i want to tell you i
[1:54:49.880 --> 1:54:55.000]  have never seen a problem that he's come up against that didn't make him bigger and stronger it always
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:59.720]  works in his favor and it's true but that's how you deal with the world right you use the i believe
[1:54:59.720 --> 1:55:03.880]  in using the energy that comes out you don't run from it it's empowering to have that energy
[1:55:03.880 --> 1:55:07.800]  count nico attacks yoda he just grabs the power that's right you know but you know i want to take
[1:55:07.800 --> 1:55:11.400]  this moment really quick to get off of just me really in general because you know what's important
[1:55:11.400 --> 1:55:15.960]  it's how we raise our children and when people ask me where does this start for you for me it
[1:55:15.960 --> 1:55:20.440]  goes back to how i was raised my parents taught me to question authority from the beginning
[1:55:20.440 --> 1:55:25.720]  they said the most important you know voice was my own my instincts and i want to tell you a quick
[1:55:25.720 --> 1:55:31.320]  story i was in third grade in boulder colorado i would walk to school every day with my sister
[1:55:31.320 --> 1:55:35.240]  it was about four blocks away i came back for lunch with my sister and i walked through the door
[1:55:35.240 --> 1:55:38.920]  and my mom said what happened your t-shirt i'd walked out the door in a t-shirt i'd made an art
[1:55:38.920 --> 1:55:43.480]  class that spelled my gymnastics team across it the flyers and she said what happened your t-shirt
[1:55:43.480 --> 1:55:47.720]  and and i said well you know craig said it looks stupid and he lives right next door to the school
[1:55:47.720 --> 1:55:52.760]  so i just borrowed a t-shirt from him my mom pulled me out of school the next day alex and and i was
[1:55:52.760 --> 1:55:57.960]  homeschooled after that she said i will never raise children that care what somebody else thinks
[1:55:57.960 --> 1:56:01.960]  you like that shirt you believed in what you're doing you're going to believe in who you are
[1:56:01.960 --> 1:56:07.000]  and what you are and that's what makes me who i am today that's how i persevere and if we don't
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:13.400]  take parenting that seriously then we are just making drones that will do whatever they're exactly
[1:56:13.400 --> 1:56:18.600]  gates admits he wants robots we want that's it we want individual souls that's it and that's what's
[1:56:18.600 --> 1:56:24.520]  critically express their own gift god gave them that's right so for the parents out there that
[1:56:24.520 --> 1:56:29.480]  say you know i want to see change in the world your children are that change you cannot fax in
[1:56:29.480 --> 1:56:33.720]  that job and if you're just going to have a nanny raise them and drop them up at school and pick
[1:56:33.720 --> 1:56:38.360]  them up and you're going to focus on your career then don't have kids yeah the tv's raising them
[1:56:38.360 --> 1:56:44.040]  that's right we can't have that is a holy act that's right your kids should be inspired to be
[1:56:44.040 --> 1:56:49.800]  difference makers in this world they should recognize that they're given a power inside of them that
[1:56:49.800 --> 1:56:55.320]  cannot be snuffed out they are not a part of a herd they are not a part of a of a of a but listen
[1:56:55.320 --> 1:57:00.200]  you're on i mean you were at cbs you want you know major awards grammy's emmy's whatever yeah the
[1:57:00.200 --> 1:57:05.480]  point is what when did you ignite like this what what happened it was just a process well you know
[1:57:06.280 --> 1:57:10.520]  it was simply getting out in front of the camera i was writing for dr phil and then i was writing
[1:57:10.520 --> 1:57:15.240]  for the doctor's television show travis stork and all these doctors i enjoyed that process
[1:57:15.240 --> 1:57:19.880]  and you just you'd complain like no i didn't want it said that way well once vax came out all of a
[1:57:19.880 --> 1:57:24.520]  sudden that put me out in front of the camera because andy wakefield we decided they're just
[1:57:24.520 --> 1:57:29.000]  and then they attacked you and that unleashed and that unleashed me they attacked me but i had the
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:33.400]  facts right i had the truth how do you attack someone that can i had no problem standing
[1:57:33.400 --> 1:57:39.080]  at cameras don't they get that they're attacks are going to make men and women that were never
[1:57:39.080 --> 1:57:42.840]  trying not to be arrogant were they're holding back no they realize the power they're unleashing
[1:57:42.840 --> 1:57:49.960]  no that's the genius right the genius is they still do not understand that attacking is power
[1:57:49.960 --> 1:57:54.120]  that every time i'm attacked you give me more publicity they have not wrapped their head
[1:57:54.120 --> 1:57:58.360]  around that's how donald trump won the election they're so arrogant they're so arrogant and they
[1:57:58.360 --> 1:58:03.800]  they're so filled with anger and rage that it blinds them to what you're what they're doing
[1:58:03.800 --> 1:58:09.640]  they're giving me free advertising by kicking me off of youtube the entire facebook social
[1:58:09.640 --> 1:58:13.960]  media is blowing up with my name right now because like oh my god i have so many people
[1:58:13.960 --> 1:58:18.280]  tune into my show yesterday and i was reading to say who is this guy i never heard of him but
[1:58:18.280 --> 1:58:22.920]  everyone said he'd been cut from the internet i didn't know he was well you're very charismatic
[1:58:22.920 --> 1:58:28.440]  and smart so i mean they just really screwed up they really screwed up because from the beginning
[1:58:28.440 --> 1:58:33.080]  from vax i've been using censorship as a power tool and they just good to know there's more men
[1:58:33.080 --> 1:58:42.200]  in the fight brother the next hour to 60 seconds away you can taste victory can't you stay with us
[1:58:47.000 --> 1:58:51.720]  another part of the great awakening was taking place is people that haven't even been religious
[1:58:51.720 --> 1:58:57.880]  or christian now see how evil is out in the open how hundreds of churches have been burned in europe
[1:58:57.880 --> 1:59:04.440]  and the us hundreds of christian icons have been burned destroyed jesus has had their heads cut off
[1:59:04.440 --> 1:59:09.480]  all over the country all over the philippines all over europe virgin marys are getting torn down i mean
[1:59:09.480 --> 1:59:15.160]  crosses are being torn down it's absolutely out of control but people now understand that evil was
[1:59:15.160 --> 1:59:21.720]  always real it is spiritual and it was just waiting to make its move building beneath the surface
[1:59:21.720 --> 1:59:26.200]  and now it's emerged that's why when i ask listeners and viewers for your prayer i mean it i'm praying
[1:59:26.200 --> 1:59:31.480]  for america i'm praying for you and i know the power prayer is real and god hears it we need to come
[1:59:31.480 --> 1:59:37.080]  together and pray for an even greater awakening pray for donald trump to be protected pray for him
[1:59:37.080 --> 1:59:42.680]  to win a landslide and pray for the people under deception of the globalist to awaken and join

[1:59:58.600 --> 2:00:10.440]  yeah the new world order put a spell on us
[2:00:12.520 --> 2:00:13.800]  this time to break that spell
[2:00:15.560 --> 2:00:20.360]  yell big tree award-winning documentary filmmaker enemy award-winning cbs producer
[2:00:21.720 --> 2:00:27.480]  at yell big tree for now at twitter but you need to go to thehighwire.com yeah so my twitter's not

[2:00:51.480 --> 2:00:55.000]  tell listeners this you know how key it is like people come to me all the street they go i well i
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:58.920]  used to love you i wish you were still on air again i'm like i'm on 200 radio stations yeah
[2:00:58.920 --> 2:01:03.960]  i got info wars dot com and band off video they're like oh yeah actually yeah see there's things
[2:01:03.960 --> 2:01:07.880]  outside twitter and facebook but we gotta get people ready for that we do we've got to start
[2:01:07.880 --> 2:01:12.600]  getting making people migrate or helping them migrate i'm hoping that there's more you know
[2:01:12.600 --> 2:01:16.840]  social media platforms that start being built by people that don't believe in censorship maybe
[2:01:16.840 --> 2:01:20.760]  aren't in it just for the cash cow and control because that's what happens as soon as you bring
[2:01:20.760 --> 2:01:25.080]  in sponsors and as soon as you have outside input then it starts changing everything you believe in
[2:01:25.080 --> 2:01:32.360]  oh this is a this is a true story five years ago they had and i had decided on a disclosure
[2:01:32.360 --> 2:01:36.120]  someone's gonna get into all of it but they had facebook made a representative reach out and they
[2:01:36.120 --> 2:01:39.800]  go listen we just want you to come to new york meet with some people and we want you to kind
[2:01:39.800 --> 2:01:43.720]  of work with us and we're gonna they said watch what happens when you do your next live feed
[2:01:43.720 --> 2:01:48.840]  i was getting like 200 000 300 000 feeds on i did a facebook it was like five million in one minute
[2:01:48.840 --> 2:01:55.240]  and they're like you like that wow but then i i still came out in the tax so imagine that currency
[2:01:55.240 --> 2:01:59.880]  they've got to buy people with that fame yeah i mean that's the thing and then a lot of people
[2:01:59.880 --> 2:02:04.280]  are vulnerable to that to me uh i'm all about the truth there's no way because what does it matter
[2:02:04.280 --> 2:02:09.160]  if there's five million viewers and you're saying bs right that's it that it's worthless that's what
[2:02:09.160 --> 2:02:13.480]  i was doing in television in many ways and that's why i'm really excited with my show i brought over
[2:02:13.480 --> 2:02:18.280]  two of the producers i worked with on cbs one is my executive producer another one i sent out in the
[2:02:18.280 --> 2:02:23.880]  field we're all living a dream right we're doing what we can never do in television you know uh in
[2:02:23.880 --> 2:02:28.600]  the internet space tell folks even in old line television all these producers all these executives
[2:02:28.600 --> 2:02:32.760]  everything you write is being looked at yeah what's it like to be your own self now i can't tell you
[2:02:32.760 --> 2:02:37.880]  how exciting it is and i have to say getting cut free of youtube i think in some ways we felt like
[2:02:37.880 --> 2:02:42.040]  that was a shackle that we didn't realize how much we were paying attention to and so now we're really
[2:02:42.040 --> 2:02:46.920]  free now they're really in trouble now we can say whatever i want i mean not that i ever worried
[2:02:46.920 --> 2:02:52.920]  have never you do seem even more energetic i am energized man i am pumped up because i i think
[2:02:52.920 --> 2:02:57.160]  and the reason is nothing like somebody punching the nose i think well and especially when you're
[2:02:57.160 --> 2:03:00.840]  looking at what just punched in the nose and they just got lucky and they're dizzy and you realize
[2:03:00.840 --> 2:03:05.400]  oh my god i'm about to knock this dude out you know i've got this i got a little stinger but
[2:03:05.400 --> 2:03:12.600]  oh my god i've got him on the ropes i think that this establishment this dark control of people
[2:03:12.600 --> 2:03:18.920]  that this cabal between silicone valley and and and pharma i think it's on his last legs they are
[2:03:18.920 --> 2:03:23.080]  so i agree you were a confident smart guy you were already happy with life but now you found
[2:03:23.080 --> 2:03:26.280]  your purpose i have you're actually facing not evil now that's right that's what people don't
[2:03:26.280 --> 2:03:30.840]  get they think like fighting evils is bad thing it's energizing like the perception opens up the
[2:03:30.840 --> 2:03:34.920]  discernment what is it like be experienced that like a like all the sudden your brain works better
[2:03:34.920 --> 2:03:38.600]  it's it's incredible in fact that's that's what this whole experience has been i never really
[2:03:38.600 --> 2:03:43.880]  thought of myself as that smarter person i you know i did okay in school i got through but now
[2:03:43.880 --> 2:03:48.760]  everything sticks the medical points and the names and the things it just flows through you and you
[2:03:48.760 --> 2:03:53.640]  realize man i've been the zone i feel like i've been in the zone for about four years since backs
[2:03:53.640 --> 2:03:58.280]  came out and then every time that's what people don't get like like they persecute me and they go
[2:03:58.280 --> 2:04:04.440]  we're defend them like are you i'm in volhalla right i know i know i think there are i know it's
[2:04:04.440 --> 2:04:09.640]  like the worst it gets the closer i it's like it's it's it's incredible yeah they say well thank you
[2:04:09.640 --> 2:04:14.360]  for your sacrifice everybody sacrifice i'm gonna have the best time of my life i could only wish
[2:04:14.360 --> 2:04:20.120]  what my life feels like right now upon everybody out there to actually find your purpose to wake up
[2:04:20.120 --> 2:04:23.960]  in the morning i used to say well you're standing just to exterminate each other right well that's
[2:04:23.960 --> 2:04:29.080]  so you're very genetics are saying good job deal big trade that's right your very ancestors are like
[2:04:29.080 --> 2:04:35.160]  yes yes i feel it you can feel it coming through us right and i think many of us alive right now
[2:04:35.160 --> 2:04:39.880]  i think there's a reason we're here right now i think that that dna is flowing through us we
[2:04:39.880 --> 2:04:46.600]  are being pulled upon stop hiding from it that's why you're in fear give your answer that's it give
[2:04:46.600 --> 2:04:53.720]  into your you know your inevitability you have a purpose on this planet and if you lock in with that
[2:04:53.720 --> 2:05:00.520]  man your wires there's nothing that can shut you down isn't it like your whole life it's women money
[2:05:00.520 --> 2:05:06.920]  power none of it does it when you click in the genetic force of the future it's like it's like
[2:05:06.920 --> 2:05:11.560]  it's like i want everybody to have this feeling you're explaining it as well as i've i've always
[2:05:11.560 --> 2:05:16.840]  i've been trying to to get it across to people there's also something else that happened you know
[2:05:16.840 --> 2:05:21.960]  it was stepping into vax i knew i was destroying everything i'd built every all your contacts
[2:05:21.960 --> 2:05:26.520]  everything was gonna go away everything was going going to go away and it was that plunge but it was
[2:05:26.520 --> 2:05:32.440]  the easiest decision i've ever made i've never seen been so clear that you are about to step on
[2:05:32.440 --> 2:05:37.160]  the road that you've been looking for your whole life and the moment i did some of that like foresight
[2:05:37.160 --> 2:05:40.600]  like all in which is a lot of fear like where's this going how's it going to build out what do you
[2:05:40.600 --> 2:05:45.240]  go and spread out it's like i'm in the instant moment and and it's like somebody else is moving
[2:05:45.240 --> 2:05:50.760]  my feet somebody else is speaking the words uh i'm just here as a vessel and i have to tell you at
[2:05:50.760 --> 2:05:55.560]  that moment you're fearless there's there's nothing that can stop you every day is a celebration of
[2:05:55.560 --> 2:06:00.760]  life and i don't care how long i'm on this planet i just want to know that that i get to experience
[2:06:00.760 --> 2:06:06.680]  it the way i'm experiencing it now as long as as long as god willing and so let's talk about the info
[2:06:06.680 --> 2:06:10.760]  the enemy doesn't want to be known about what's really in these vaccines the day trials to tell
[2:06:10.760 --> 2:06:14.920]  people what the enemy doesn't want to hear well i mean so here's the deal these vaccines are are
[2:06:14.920 --> 2:06:21.080]  extremely extremely dangerous only you know 0.26 percent of people should even be considering this
[2:06:21.080 --> 2:06:26.920]  vaccine they're the only ones that are risking death what you have to recognize is 99.74 percent of
[2:06:26.920 --> 2:06:31.560]  us are not dying from this and most of us have got to take a test just to find out we have it
[2:06:31.560 --> 2:06:37.080]  because we have no symptoms and you'll i want you to watch this they're slowly backing away from
[2:06:37.080 --> 2:06:40.920]  the you know what i've been calling the vaccine unicorn we're gonna find the unicorn this is now
[2:06:40.920 --> 2:06:47.960]  a chihuahua with an ice cream cone glued to its head because the FDA is saying we will accept a 50
[2:06:47.960 --> 2:06:53.800]  percent success rate now with a vaccine that we bring forward which is absolutely useless if not
[2:06:53.800 --> 2:07:00.120]  you think about here's what i want you to know your own immune system is beating any vaccine or drug
[2:07:00.120 --> 2:07:07.320]  that we have ever seen we have never seen any drug on this planet with a 99.74 percent success rate
[2:07:07.320 --> 2:07:13.720]  the human body the god-given body you have or the evolution machine that's been designed perfectly
[2:07:13.720 --> 2:07:22.520]  however you want to look at it has a 99.74 success rate against this virus and if you then for those
[2:07:22.520 --> 2:07:26.920]  of you that in the 0.26 percent i would highly recommend looking at the hydroxychloroquine
[2:07:26.920 --> 2:07:31.400]  if you're in that group that just for some reason your antibodies aren't working right
[2:07:31.400 --> 2:07:37.160]  and one thing we now know is that 60 to 80 percent of the people in this world were already immune
[2:07:37.160 --> 2:07:42.920]  you cannot get it odds are you can't get COVID-19 because you already had coronavirus because you
[2:07:42.920 --> 2:07:47.880]  already had a coronavirus last year five years ago and all you need is then regular nutrients
[2:07:47.880 --> 2:07:52.200]  that's it you need your vitamins you need good food look it if you want to run around you know
[2:07:52.200 --> 2:07:56.840]  eating mcdonald's every day doritos drinking coca-cola then i might think you know i might
[2:07:56.840 --> 2:08:01.400]  recommend a vaccine for you because you're destroying your body anyway and i don't know what hope
[2:08:01.400 --> 2:08:06.360]  you have but if you're treating treating your body right if you exercise if you eat correctly
[2:08:06.360 --> 2:08:10.760]  if you watch how much fluoride you're drinking and it's a spiritual thing though absolutely like
[2:08:10.760 --> 2:08:14.520]  they know that studies the spiritual really boosts the immune system you know it was amazing i had
[2:08:14.520 --> 2:08:18.280]  an opportunity to be at the national institute of health across from tony fouchy was this far away
[2:08:18.280 --> 2:08:22.520]  from me francis collins with their bobby kennedy and i had a meeting set up by donald trump and and
[2:08:22.520 --> 2:08:26.840]  we said to them if vaccines are so great why don't you just do a comparative study you're
[2:08:26.840 --> 2:08:31.800]  sitting on a database of 10 million people tens of thousands of unvaccinated people just compare
[2:08:31.800 --> 2:08:36.520]  them have the group the vaccinated and the unvaccinated ask simple questions who has more cancer who
[2:08:36.520 --> 2:08:42.600]  has more diabetes who has more ad d adhd who has more autism or other neurological disorders and
[2:08:42.600 --> 2:08:47.800]  you know what they said we can't figure out a way to do that study wait a minute i'm sitting at the
[2:08:47.800 --> 2:08:52.760]  national institute of health this is the thought leaders of science in the world and you can't
[2:08:52.760 --> 2:08:58.040]  figure out how to compare two groups and you know what they basically admitted they said we don't
[2:08:58.040 --> 2:09:04.600]  know how to isolate the co-founding issues because people who don't vaccinate don't live the same
[2:09:04.600 --> 2:09:10.200]  life as others there are other issues that get in the way of their lifestyle choices meaning
[2:09:10.200 --> 2:09:14.520]  people that don't vaccinate also probably aren't standing in airport scanners every time they go
[2:09:14.520 --> 2:09:18.600]  into an airport they're probably not drinking fluoridated water they're definitely not eating
[2:09:18.600 --> 2:09:23.800]  doritos every day and drinking coca-cola you know like it's going out of style and so that's what
[2:09:23.800 --> 2:09:28.360]  they're saying to you what they're saying is we we've already done the study and no matter how
[2:09:28.360 --> 2:09:32.680]  we look at anti-vaxxers they're healthier than those that are vaccinating but we know just like
[2:09:32.680 --> 2:09:37.160]  almost don't this like how much don't have autism right so since i have a healthy lifestyle i gotta
[2:09:37.160 --> 2:09:42.440]  be poisoned so that the dorito eaters are allowed to walk in this planet i'm sorry no big tree is on
[2:09:42.440 --> 2:09:48.920]  fire stay with us the people are awakening they're taking control of their own environment cell
[2:09:48.920 --> 2:09:54.280]  phones are an amazing tool really they're a supercomputer that's handheld but big tech large
[2:09:54.280 --> 2:09:59.480]  corporations hackers governments foreign governments the chai comms especially are using
[2:09:59.480 --> 2:10:05.400]  this to steal your data to share your data to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up
[2:10:05.400 --> 2:10:11.320]  billions of people's data they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements
[2:10:11.320 --> 2:10:18.840]  cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their ai takeover in their own words
[2:10:18.840 --> 2:10:23.080]  they admit it show i've been selling privacy pouches and blocket pockets and things like that
[2:10:23.080 --> 2:10:27.400]  for more than a decade and now the units have gotten really lightweight they're faraday cages
[2:10:27.400 --> 2:10:32.120]  they just look like a cloth envelope they work absolutely great and it just gives you that
[2:10:32.120 --> 2:10:37.560]  security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and

[2:12:16.600 --> 2:12:22.760]  any award-winning producer y'all big tree is here but his real lore ulcers the work he's done with
[2:12:22.760 --> 2:12:28.520]  vaxton how he's been banned off youtube and the rest of it and all these medical doctors coming out
[2:12:28.520 --> 2:12:35.640]  exposing these therapeutics that are incredibly effective against covid-19 yeah being banned so
[2:12:35.640 --> 2:12:40.680]  it's not the kkk being banned i don't like the kkk but i say don't ban them because next will be me
[2:12:40.680 --> 2:12:45.640]  well then it was me and now it's medical doctors i mean this is so cut and dry and i think they've
[2:12:45.640 --> 2:12:49.720]  really jumped the shark well they have you know what's amazing about that when you when you said
[2:12:49.720 --> 2:12:54.280]  that is you know thousands of doctors and scientists that are being sidelined right they're being
[2:12:54.280 --> 2:12:59.880]  called liars and this is exactly what happened to dr andy wakefield it's the heart of vax i mean
[2:12:59.880 --> 2:13:05.160]  this scientist talk about that is he not vindicated wow i i believe that he has been vindicated i
[2:13:05.160 --> 2:13:09.080]  know that history will look back and say we lost one of the greatest scientists of our time by the
[2:13:09.080 --> 2:13:15.320]  way he just put out a great film uh 1986 the act which talks about how they took liability away from
[2:13:15.320 --> 2:13:21.320]  the vaccines so we had this great scientist in the uk that had his career destroyed by the general
[2:13:21.320 --> 2:13:26.680]  medical council which is basically their hhs or their tony fouchy went after a doctor that was
[2:13:26.680 --> 2:13:31.960]  saying i'm seeing some sort of connection between this m mr vaccine and injury in children well
[2:13:31.960 --> 2:13:35.320]  doctors all around the world say well he's that discredited doctor in fact i bet you've
[2:13:35.320 --> 2:13:38.920]  you grabbed the 12 people that stood up in front of the supreme court they'd say oh yeah that andy
[2:13:38.920 --> 2:13:43.960]  wakefield guy you know he was fraudulent but they don't recognize that's what they're doing to you
[2:13:43.960 --> 2:13:50.440]  this is what they do it is so easy to do it if they own the television and now all 20 years later
[2:13:50.440 --> 2:13:56.120]  all the science proves it's gut flora and issues with vaccines and autoimmune the man was way ahead
[2:13:56.120 --> 2:14:02.520]  of his time you never heard of gut flora and he had done 170 studies that were published in journals
[2:14:02.520 --> 2:14:07.400]  on crone's disease gut flora talking about how your gut flora does appear to be affecting your
[2:14:07.400 --> 2:14:12.200]  brain not take credit away he said the mothers told them when they have diarrhea when they're
[2:14:12.200 --> 2:14:15.800]  having crones yeah that's when they're mental and then he found out about the connection well
[2:14:15.800 --> 2:14:20.200]  that was what was amazing about that study that he's famous for that this was apparently debunked
[2:14:20.200 --> 2:14:25.960]  total lie uh you know how it was debunked is outrageous but that's what they saw when they
[2:14:25.960 --> 2:14:29.560]  had these 12 kids that were in this study they were autistic their parents are saying their autism
[2:14:29.560 --> 2:14:34.680]  started right after they developed this gut disease that happened right after the vaccinations well
[2:14:34.680 --> 2:14:38.600]  when they would clear their intestines out right they were going to do colonoscopies and things to
[2:14:38.600 --> 2:14:42.520]  find out what is this gut illness that's what the parents were bringing their children forward
[2:14:42.520 --> 2:14:46.920]  just like you drink alcohol you get high right there was a poison they would clear them out for
[2:14:46.920 --> 2:14:50.360]  the you know the day before they were going to get the colonoscopy and all of a sudden all the
[2:14:50.360 --> 2:14:55.800]  repetitive motions would disappear in the kids why was it affecting you know their their their
[2:14:55.800 --> 2:15:00.040]  psychological what was supposed to be a psychological problem why is cleaning out their intestinal
[2:15:00.040 --> 2:15:04.760]  system making their mannerisms and and these associations to autism disappear it was one of
[2:15:04.760 --> 2:15:10.200]  the greatest discoveries of all times and what do we do we just destroyed it the the medical
[2:15:10.200 --> 2:15:15.640]  establishment said oh we can't have you know and you know and now gave this money and bought the whole
[2:15:15.640 --> 2:15:21.000]  field that's it bought the whole field is running it every side of it the testing side of it the
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:26.440]  vaccinating side of it the tracking side of it the cyber side of it all of it is being controlled
[2:15:26.440 --> 2:15:31.640]  I mean this is these are scary scary times but the point I want to make is when we look at this
[2:15:31.640 --> 2:15:36.120]  and this is this is gonna be hard I think for some of your your listeners it is for mine too
[2:15:36.120 --> 2:15:41.880]  but the point is is you know who's at risk of COVID-19 it's the pharmaceutical dependent people
[2:15:41.880 --> 2:15:46.840]  that's who it is it's not that you're over the age of 65 is that you're over the age of 65 with
[2:15:46.840 --> 2:15:52.040]  comorbidities like heart disease COPD you should have been smoking the cigarettes your whole life
[2:15:52.040 --> 2:15:56.760]  I'm sorry but you know it's a free country you said I want to live in the moment I want to drink
[2:15:56.760 --> 2:16:00.760]  as much as I want to alcohol I may not want to smoke cigarettes I want to eat McDonald's and
[2:16:00.760 --> 2:16:05.480]  guess what it's a free country but now that you're sick and now that you're on drugs to keep you
[2:16:05.480 --> 2:16:11.000]  alive you're not allowed to say that it's my responsibility to change the way I live so that
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:15.960]  I can protect you you know what you're in a bubble you need to be in a bubble you put yourself in
[2:16:15.960 --> 2:16:20.200]  that bubble but when we heard the story of the boy in the bubble that we grew up with it was one
[2:16:20.200 --> 2:16:24.360]  cheat in a bubble we felt bad for him he had autoimmune disease well now he's the only one out
[2:16:24.360 --> 2:16:29.400]  of the bubble the rest of us have got to wear a bubble and that is not cool exactly he's in the
[2:16:29.400 --> 2:16:33.880]  bubble so we got to be a right we all got to be in a bubble no I'm sorry whatever happens to you
[2:16:33.880 --> 2:16:39.080]  whatever that you're you know is going on with you I know it's like 60% a burst now I was reading
[2:16:39.080 --> 2:16:46.440]  in Austin it's like 50% nationwide are a cesarean and they they they induce the delivery the cervix
[2:16:46.440 --> 2:16:51.000]  doesn't soften then they've got to do the thing they're making everything artificial and everything
[2:16:51.000 --> 2:16:56.440]  is artificial and they skip the entire biome process right birth we know all of that bacteria all
[2:16:56.440 --> 2:17:00.680]  that natural bacteria that's going to protect the skin that they're going to drink in and breathe in
[2:17:00.680 --> 2:17:05.800]  and creates their gut virus all their mother's immunity it's not there they're not getting any
[2:17:05.800 --> 2:17:10.120]  of the mother's immunity and the mother's not having that interaction she's not triggering
[2:17:10.120 --> 2:17:15.160]  you know her own you know connection systems with the child you know we have we have postpartum
[2:17:15.160 --> 2:17:20.440]  depression like we've never seen because we're we're not having that last handoff moment you know
[2:17:20.440 --> 2:17:25.640]  where these two souls that we found together you know separate out spiritual moment it is a spiritual
[2:17:25.640 --> 2:17:32.120]  moment and we're taking the spiritual moment away and we're and and that's binding the bind
[2:17:32.120 --> 2:17:36.840]  yeah and and this is the foolhardiness of modern medicine right it's going to just but it knows
[2:17:36.840 --> 2:17:41.800]  what it's doing it's taking control of the process well that's where you and I might differ maybe
[2:17:41.800 --> 2:17:45.800]  I I don't give them that much I don't think the average doctor knows but up at the level
[2:17:45.800 --> 2:17:49.880]  there are probably some really sick individuals a couple of them at the top that know what's
[2:17:49.880 --> 2:17:53.560]  going on most doctors but you just said you know it's a big spiritual moment when a mother
[2:17:53.560 --> 2:17:57.400]  gives birth that's right and that whole moment and that thing is like a connection we you know we
[2:17:57.400 --> 2:18:01.240]  had midwives and we were giving birth through our children and and the midwives to talk about
[2:18:01.240 --> 2:18:05.960]  the times that they have to transport to a hospital there are you know the doctors call
[2:18:05.960 --> 2:18:10.120]  in all the new doctors and say come watch this there's going to be a natural childbirth as though
[2:18:10.120 --> 2:18:15.720]  it has not I mean literally they hadn't seen one so it's incredible they got around like oh my god
[2:18:15.720 --> 2:18:20.440]  like like aliens like aliens watching a woman give birth like we've never seen anything like this
[2:18:20.440 --> 2:18:24.840]  that's how bad it is nobody's saying naturally giving birth they'll be a moment where they say oh
[2:18:24.840 --> 2:18:29.800]  it's a conspiracy that women ever breastfed right try to keep the kid away for a day that's it milk
[2:18:29.800 --> 2:18:34.440]  doesn't come in I mean it's all scientific and then and then remember we had that whole because
[2:18:34.440 --> 2:18:39.080]  the brain isn't being bigger if you get the milk your mother had for you well which isn't just
[2:18:39.080 --> 2:18:45.720]  protein and fat it's literally all of her immunity and all of her get enzymes that do not exist on
[2:18:45.720 --> 2:18:50.520]  this planet anywhere else that totally trigger the brain and that change depending on where the kid
[2:18:50.520 --> 2:18:54.840]  is at when a kid is sick do you know that the mother's milk changes to absolutely to deal with
[2:18:54.840 --> 2:18:59.560]  that illness there's nothing like it on the planet they can't deal with that science that's not no no and
[2:18:59.560 --> 2:19:03.720]  oh and you're oh and by again again it's oh and you are man you want i'm gonna be a mean kid so
[2:19:03.720 --> 2:19:07.880]  we're gonna breastfed but it's known the brain's a third smaller on average it doesn't have the
[2:19:07.880 --> 2:19:12.440]  connections and that's why they're zombified they literally didn't get what do you think women got
[2:19:12.440 --> 2:19:17.560]  these four while we love them that's like the future of humanity's in those breasts right well and
[2:19:17.560 --> 2:19:23.000]  this is the problem I'm I get it some mothers can't do we're not judging them I'm not judging you
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:26.920]  but trying to keep kids away from that and that's where science is great right science is great that
[2:19:26.920 --> 2:19:31.640]  it figures out a way to create a formula that for those of you that cannot know they knew donkey milk
[2:19:31.640 --> 2:19:36.200]  was you know right but but that's supposed to be for a small percentage of us like every drug
[2:19:36.200 --> 2:19:40.600]  everything you do what science is only good for a few people but it's when hey we're just not making
[2:19:40.600 --> 2:19:44.680]  enough money let's get everybody to stop breastfeeding let's sell our products to everybody
[2:19:44.680 --> 2:19:49.080]  and that's the sickness right that's where it goes they're forcing you so you use a product
[2:19:49.080 --> 2:19:53.880]  taking healthy people and putting them on a regiment they don't need that's what vaccinations
[2:19:53.880 --> 2:19:59.960]  are doing healthy people don't die from measles healthy people don't die from polio healthy people
[2:19:59.960 --> 2:20:04.440]  don't die from these things in fact I only get sick like once every five years that's right because
[2:20:04.440 --> 2:20:09.160]  obviously you take care of yourself and and and they'll say it's practically illegal to make that
[2:20:09.160 --> 2:20:14.680]  point now right no doctor right think about how crazy this is and you know when I get sick it's
[2:20:14.680 --> 2:20:20.600]  like I'm at the RNC I'm up for three days I'm drinking a bunch and I'm drinking tons of caffeine
[2:20:20.600 --> 2:20:25.400]  and then I get sick right it's every time I push myself way out past you have your adrenaline going
[2:20:25.400 --> 2:20:29.320]  and going and going you're not eating right you're skipping meals you're missing your vitamins
[2:20:29.320 --> 2:20:33.800]  you're drinking crappy water and the next thing you know you know you pay the price I think about
[2:20:33.800 --> 2:20:37.400]  people live like that every day though when I see these people when I watch these grocery
[2:20:37.400 --> 2:20:40.440]  carts and here's the thing right they're trying to say that I have to wear a mask to protect you

[2:22:47.240 --> 2:22:54.360]  we laid out the ai takeover plan the tracking of cell phones how programmed master computers would
[2:22:54.360 --> 2:23:00.440]  manipulate control society how they'd be able to not just predict large groups of human movements
[2:23:00.440 --> 2:23:04.680]  and activities but even predict what individuals would do and then once you could predict what
[2:23:04.680 --> 2:23:11.320]  individuals were going to be doing you can add stimuli through the ai systems through the computers
[2:23:11.320 --> 2:23:15.560]  through digital billboards through face scanning through the social credit score
[2:23:15.560 --> 2:23:20.840]  to control people and make them act like you wanted to but when we cover that the media would attack
[2:23:20.840 --> 2:23:26.120]  us and say we were making it up it was a conspiracy theory even though it was in the actual corporate
[2:23:26.120 --> 2:23:31.160]  level blueprint documents well the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they
[2:23:31.160 --> 2:23:36.840]  are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out and it's something about
[2:23:36.840 --> 2:23:52.200]  a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned so we might want to dismantle the system now
[2:23:58.840 --> 2:24:05.800]  a durnovaccine sound concerning we looked after the second dose at least 80 percent of participants
[2:24:05.800 --> 2:24:15.480]  experienced a systemic side effect ranging from severe chills to fevers so are these vaccines safe
[2:24:17.240 --> 2:24:26.600]  well the uh the fda not being pressured will look hard at that the fda is the gold standard of
[2:24:26.600 --> 2:24:33.800]  regulators uh and their current guidance on this if they stick with that is is very very
[2:24:33.800 --> 2:24:39.000]  appropriate so he falls back on the immunity from the 1986 act del big tree award-winning
[2:24:39.000 --> 2:24:43.880]  documentary filmmaker and me award winner is here with us at del big tree's lockdown on
[2:24:43.880 --> 2:24:49.080]  twitter he's banned on youtube now but you still find him at thehiwire.com let's talk about bill
[2:24:49.080 --> 2:24:54.760]  gates and his agenda and what he's doing and where you see all this going well i think that there's
[2:24:54.760 --> 2:24:59.560]  an agenda to forcibly inject every single human on this planet that's what he's already said they
[2:24:59.560 --> 2:25:05.640]  want 7.5 billion people uh being vaccinated this is what the world health organization met back in
[2:25:05.640 --> 2:25:11.080]  december to how to stop vaccine hesitancy because our goal is to have everybody vaccinating why do
[2:25:11.080 --> 2:25:15.320]  they have to vaccinate everybody because the vaccine program failed you have to understand
[2:25:15.320 --> 2:25:19.560]  when they started the vaccine program the idea was you could get a vaccine to do what nature did
[2:25:19.560 --> 2:25:24.200]  when you catch a virus you have lifelong immunity well let's make money off of that process and
[2:25:24.200 --> 2:25:28.680]  control it and so they gave us the measles vaccine but within five years they recognize oh my god it's
[2:25:28.680 --> 2:25:33.640]  wearing off right away so they added a second back and they gave us peanut allergies all the other
[2:25:33.640 --> 2:25:39.320]  problems but besides that let's just look at the inherent issue you now have cdc talking about a third
[2:25:39.320 --> 2:25:43.560]  m mr vaccine by the time they go into college they're talking about there's two more m mr vaccines
[2:25:43.560 --> 2:25:47.960]  i'm just talking about measles as adults we're talking about five m mr's you're already getting
[2:25:47.960 --> 2:25:52.920]  five d tap vaccines by the time you're 18 years old so these things are wearing off and so this
[2:25:52.920 --> 2:25:58.680]  and they're saying five for old people for covid correct and here's the issue everything that everyone's
[2:25:58.680 --> 2:26:04.120]  been vaccinated for is wearing off and all of the outbreaks it's not the anti-vaxxers it's the people
[2:26:04.120 --> 2:26:08.680]  who were vaccinated who now have no immune system the vaccine is well you're not lying the studies
[2:26:08.680 --> 2:26:12.680]  show it's the vax that are getting so the vax start getting sick they're the ones catching up no
[2:26:12.680 --> 2:26:17.560]  immune system even worse because there's been vaccinations out there just like so they're trying
[2:26:17.560 --> 2:26:22.120]  to prop up their collapsing house that's it it's falling apart it's falling apart and the only thing
[2:26:22.120 --> 2:26:26.520]  they need to do is inject you more we just got to keep injecting them we'll figure and this is it
[2:26:26.520 --> 2:26:32.440]  it's like they're like rats on a sinking ship you know the problem is is that their only way is
[2:26:32.440 --> 2:26:36.920]  we don't know how to fix the problem polio is now running rampant in many countries
[2:26:36.920 --> 2:26:42.200]  caused by the vaccine and so they call it polio like polio like but they're all they're
[2:26:42.200 --> 2:26:47.800]  even they're not they're not even doing that cdc is admitting it's vaccine strain me polio that's
[2:26:47.800 --> 2:26:52.040]  when you know in the fine print they admit it's what's scary so how the hell are they giving you
[2:26:52.040 --> 2:26:57.800]  we are not being vaccinated for this my grandmother died at 92 three years ago and i remember she
[2:26:57.800 --> 2:27:01.480]  told me she said no my doctor told me the second round the shots i was giving it she was like i'm
[2:27:01.480 --> 2:27:06.600]  tough it's okay she was paralyzed most of her life in a wheelchair yeah but the point is is that they
[2:27:06.600 --> 2:27:11.080]  told her the vaccine gave it to her that's right they used to admit it right and we we used to say
[2:27:11.080 --> 2:27:15.880]  it is a casualty it's a side effect you hear bill gates saying you know 10 thousand or 10 million
[2:27:15.880 --> 2:27:20.200]  people whatever his numbers will get injured by this vaccine but you know that's just part of
[2:27:20.200 --> 2:27:24.280]  what we have to put up with well why are we just putting up with this tiny little casualty from
[2:27:24.280 --> 2:27:28.680]  the virus then where none of us even have any side effects i mean think about this materna is
[2:27:28.680 --> 2:27:33.480]  injuring everybody everybody's getting sick that virus can't do that the virus isn't that what are
[2:27:33.480 --> 2:27:39.480]  they thinking where it says a hundred percent got sick 20 with the hospital 80 got super ill
[2:27:39.480 --> 2:27:44.760]  what the hell why would you do this inject everyone knowing they're gonna get sick and you're the
[2:27:44.760 --> 2:27:50.360]  villain you're gonna make 100 percent of people sick with the vaccine when only 0.2 per six percent
[2:27:50.360 --> 2:27:54.600]  are having a problem with the virus so so so is this does does bill gates have a death wish
[2:27:55.560 --> 2:28:02.040]  you know he's just arrogant i think that he is blind and it's really gets to a spiritual story
[2:28:02.040 --> 2:28:06.840]  right it's i i think back to the creation story and god says hey just don't eat of the knowledge
[2:28:06.840 --> 2:28:10.680]  of the tree of good and evil and as a kid i didn't really understand that when i look at bill gates
[2:28:10.680 --> 2:28:14.280]  this is the problem right you have this beautiful world i've got it all figured out
[2:28:14.280 --> 2:28:18.200]  we've got the bacteria and virus you've been working in concert everything's working perfectly
[2:28:18.200 --> 2:28:23.560]  but then man thinks oh no i'm smarter than god right i'm smarter than all this i can i can start
[2:28:23.560 --> 2:28:28.520]  eliminating a bacteria i can i can eradicate a virus inside of your body even though there's
[2:28:28.520 --> 2:28:33.880]  billions so bottom line is don't play god inside of you don't play god and once you start playing
[2:28:33.880 --> 2:28:38.360]  god where do you stop well you have to double down you once there's a problem oh i'm the only one
[2:28:38.360 --> 2:28:42.200]  that can fix the problem because god didn't make this problem man made this problem and so now we're
[2:28:42.200 --> 2:28:47.720]  in a position where vaccines are what are destroying herd immunity the only let me be perfectly clear
[2:28:47.720 --> 2:28:53.400]  the only thing vaccines have ever achieved is destroying herd immunity never created it
[2:28:53.400 --> 2:28:58.680]  it destroying explain that yes that's true because we had herd immunity no one was dying
[2:28:58.680 --> 2:29:04.040]  from measles by the time the vaccine came along in 1961 the death rate of measles in america's one
[2:29:04.040 --> 2:29:11.880]  out of 500 000 americans that's 000 000 like after the decimal point but then the vaccine came along
[2:29:11.880 --> 2:29:16.600]  there were things that we had no baby even in an outbreak ever died from measles because they
[2:29:16.600 --> 2:29:22.280]  couldn't get it why because mothers that had gotten measles as kids held on their lifelong immunity
[2:29:22.280 --> 2:29:27.240]  but passed it on to the child once they were born now that we're back playing the first three weeks
[2:29:27.240 --> 2:29:32.520]  of milk has all the immunity it i don't even think you have to breastfeed it is literally
[2:29:32.520 --> 2:29:37.480]  placenta driven that you draw that you have the immunity given over the breastfeeding takes a
[2:29:37.480 --> 2:29:42.280]  year and a half of the mean of natural immunity and maybe extends it to two or three years what's
[2:29:42.280 --> 2:29:47.640]  called colostrum the colostrum huge i mean it's huge in the health of the baby as if as if our
[2:29:47.640 --> 2:29:53.240]  mother is it better than bill gates right uh it's a human it's us it's an attack on women really
[2:29:53.240 --> 2:29:57.640]  right this entire thing is the most that's how it's shocking women are i mean and i and i was
[2:29:57.640 --> 2:30:03.480]  once a liberal most of my life but you know for a group to say oh you know i'm with her and you
[2:30:03.480 --> 2:30:09.880]  know women's first my body my choice they hate women they hate the intuitive inside of women
[2:30:09.880 --> 2:30:15.640]  the power of women the power to heal and feed and give birth and give life bill gates wants to be
[2:30:15.640 --> 2:30:21.080]  that woman he wants that power he wants to create life he wants to control life he wants to manipulate
[2:30:21.080 --> 2:30:27.320]  life he wants to affect population size and the planet earth he wants to affect how we farm how we
[2:30:27.320 --> 2:30:33.320]  grow things how we poison he wants to pray he wants to be our god he does he's got a god complex
[2:30:33.320 --> 2:30:37.000]  you're on fire you know they trade you're absolutely right so what do you predict coming
[2:30:37.000 --> 2:30:42.360]  in the future because there is a global awakening i i believe that we are going to see all of this
[2:30:42.360 --> 2:30:46.920]  fall i think bill gates is going to fall i do i think out in the future he will be tried for
[2:30:46.920 --> 2:30:52.040]  treason and rightfully so this man is an american citizen that worked with foreign agents and when
[2:30:52.040 --> 2:30:57.240]  i see when i got pulled uh you know off of youtube you know they they put up things like you know the
[2:30:57.240 --> 2:31:03.240]  who we we respond to what the who who is not that's not even a government agency since when is the
[2:31:03.240 --> 2:31:10.840]  un say medical doctors and and and major emmy award-winning filmmakers at cbs don't have speech
[2:31:10.840 --> 2:31:16.440]  right think about we're under un control i am not allowed to question the pharmaceutical industry
[2:31:16.440 --> 2:31:21.240]  that has paid out hundreds of billions of dollars for murdering innocent people whether it's the
[2:31:21.240 --> 2:31:26.440]  sackman sackman family and johnson and johnson with the oxy cotton epidemic johnson and johnson
[2:31:26.440 --> 2:31:31.240]  has a vaccine in this game they are rushing a vaccine that killed animals in trials they lied
[2:31:31.240 --> 2:31:36.600]  to us about oxy cotton that is now getting 60 70 000 people killed every year that the fda was
[2:31:36.600 --> 2:31:41.480]  behind cdc they all they want to just normalize killing us they want to normalize and they don't
[2:31:41.480 --> 2:31:45.720]  want any responsibility we can be wrong we can get you killed we can say that talcum powder was
[2:31:45.720 --> 2:31:50.920]  safe your whole lives now we know it was asbestos we're sprinkling asbestos on our naked babies
[2:31:50.920 --> 2:31:56.200]  because johnson and johnson could was like you know cared about us and our children was all of these
[2:31:56.200 --> 2:32:01.880]  people murder them it's a sick joke murk visor it's all about money we see when when we consume
[2:32:01.880 --> 2:32:06.120]  right when you can actually sue the manufacturers which you can't with vaccines you get to see
[2:32:06.120 --> 2:32:10.200]  their internal emails where they're laughing about the people that are going to die and they point to
[2:32:10.200 --> 2:32:15.800]  the bottom line it's like it's a bear with the with the blood the factor eight they said screw
[2:32:15.800 --> 2:32:19.640]  these hemophiliacs so what do they die so what we know they're gonna die we'll make so much money
[2:32:19.640 --> 2:32:23.320]  anyway why would you why are you gonna cost us why would you ride it in corporate minutes
[2:32:24.680 --> 2:32:29.240]  arrogance right i mean and that's it that's what darkness is it if once you're god what are you
[2:32:29.240 --> 2:32:33.080]  afraid of we got another i can write whatever i want i'm god right well that's why they're
[2:32:33.080 --> 2:32:38.120]  gonna fall jesus christ that's why they make the mistakes that they do and that's why no one can
[2:32:38.120 --> 2:32:42.840]  stand that man right bill gates literally think about what he thought the plan was there was a
[2:32:42.840 --> 2:32:48.600]  couple weeks ago he was on ellen jenner's he was literally like on every new you know a media platform
[2:32:48.600 --> 2:32:53.160]  i'm sure he's funding them he's literally paying he is on record he was forced to be at his party
[2:32:53.160 --> 2:32:58.280]  he's like that pathetic kid that no one likes and the family just buys his friends he bought his way
[2:32:58.280 --> 2:33:04.040]  into television you know stations across the country and ellen's feed you know on social media
[2:33:04.040 --> 2:33:09.640]  that had the video up had so much negativity they had to take it down people hate bill gates
[2:33:09.640 --> 2:33:13.480]  which you have to recognize that if that was part of the plan i'm going to be the ruling
[2:33:13.480 --> 2:33:17.080]  dictator and everyone's gonna love me and they're going to just do whatever i say that's the beauty
[2:33:17.080 --> 2:33:21.960]  that humanity is rejecting we're human and that's where we have got to stay confident you have to
[2:33:21.960 --> 2:33:27.640]  recognize that even the people that are wearing masks that you know deep down hate it inside of
[2:33:27.640 --> 2:33:31.640]  them there's still their blood is boiling about it something's really wrong and now this jerk
[2:33:32.280 --> 2:33:36.920]  fouchy's gonna make me wear goggles i mean are we serious wow they'll be

[2:37:38.600 --> 2:37:52.120]  this is it's available at infowarstore.com you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:37:52.120 --> 2:38:06.200]  all right dale big treat
[2:38:07.240 --> 2:38:11.560]  documentary filmmaker of vaccines where this is on fire i've invited him to come co-host
[2:38:11.560 --> 2:38:15.960]  he got me once and we've got uh daughter nick baggis one of the pioneers exposing the whole
[2:38:15.960 --> 2:38:20.920]  global's operation coming up about to take over next hour but i've got so many articles here
[2:38:20.920 --> 2:38:28.520]  ohio abandons its hydroxychloroquine ban after public outrage that is such a big victory
[2:38:28.520 --> 2:38:33.320]  that they're firing doctors they're they're persecuting them they're censoring them but
[2:38:33.320 --> 2:38:37.560]  the fact it's an approved drug it has an incredible success rate the fact that they're
[2:38:37.560 --> 2:38:42.680]  trying to create this fear and it's blowing up in his face that's a major positive it's really
[2:38:42.680 --> 2:38:48.200]  major and it just shows you know how the people we've got to recognize how powerful we are right
[2:38:48.200 --> 2:38:52.520]  all of these you know when they took down those videos that's one thing the 17 million views
[2:38:52.520 --> 2:38:56.200]  with the doctors that stood in front of the supreme court but that's not what blew my mind
[2:38:56.200 --> 2:39:01.000]  the next morning when i woke up tuesday morning my facebook feed was nothing but that video
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:04.520]  people stepping forward saying i and you know that you saw them getting warnings and if your
[2:39:04.520 --> 2:39:08.760]  listeners are just joining us explain yeah there were like a bunch of doctors so you had 12 doctors
[2:39:08.760 --> 2:39:14.280]  it was uh it was america's front line doctor's summit uh in front of uh it was put out by bright
[2:39:14.280 --> 2:39:19.720]  bar did the video uh you had great people putting it together but they brought a letter of 600
[2:39:19.720 --> 2:39:23.720]  doctors and signed it to get to donald trump they stood in front of the supreme court talks this
[2:39:23.720 --> 2:39:29.640]  this doctor right here she has healed 300 of her patients no one died with hydroxychloroquine
[2:39:29.640 --> 2:39:34.360]  they all had similar stories telling the truth saying we really do have a treatment people
[2:39:34.360 --> 2:39:39.240]  don't need to die anymore this death rate can be stopped right now in its tracks that we just used
[2:39:39.240 --> 2:39:45.720]  this brilliant treatment it's available 17 million views on facebook in six hours and then facebook
[2:39:45.720 --> 2:39:50.760]  pulled it youtube pulled it twitter pulled it an absolute total commitment to evil a total
[2:39:50.760 --> 2:39:55.880]  commitment to evil and admitting it right and then what i was saying the next morning it was the
[2:39:55.880 --> 2:40:00.840]  citizens the people that just found that video and just started putting up so that all i could see
[2:40:00.840 --> 2:40:05.160]  was thousands and thousands only have two million views on band dot video amazing right people have
[2:40:05.160 --> 2:40:10.280]  just gone crazy and and that's the difference you cannot stop the people they cannot stop the truth
[2:40:10.280 --> 2:40:13.800]  and that and what do you think they're gonna take down and now more doctors are coming out more
[2:40:13.800 --> 2:40:18.600]  doctors are now being emboldened saying i'm gonna stand with those doctors i'm gonna and scientists
[2:40:18.600 --> 2:40:23.000]  all around the world the one thing that has really shifted alex and and i've been at this for five
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:27.800]  years discovered you know discussing vaccines and health and safety around drug companies
[2:40:27.800 --> 2:40:32.440]  is that they used to always say that there's the consensus of science says that vaccines are safe
[2:40:32.440 --> 2:40:38.440]  the consensus of science they have destroyed their own consensus with us their consensus is dead
[2:40:38.440 --> 2:40:43.560]  you now have you know ddr by the way we don't lie we don't lie we don't say positive things but not
[2:40:43.560 --> 2:40:48.840]  true you're right they are destroying their own consensus this is a big deal they are making their
[2:40:48.840 --> 2:40:55.320]  own doctors not trust the fda that you you saw the u in video december at the who the head of
[2:40:55.320 --> 2:40:59.160]  vaccine goes our doctors don't believe it we're hurting people right we don't test it there's a
[2:40:59.160 --> 2:41:03.000]  cover up we're we're covering up we got to be more honest with our doctors we got to do more
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:06.520]  studies we can put in their hands so that they can defend the products that they're giving because
[2:41:06.520 --> 2:41:12.360]  these parents are coming more armed with more and then and then the doctors so we're skipping them
[2:41:12.360 --> 2:41:17.160]  right right they said stop it no no we're not doing more studies we're going to keep our our
[2:41:17.160 --> 2:41:21.000]  doctors more in the dark and any doctor that steps forward we're going to try and wait so we
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:25.240]  reached that point though when psychos get caught i'm gonna say this be positive yeah this is true
[2:41:25.240 --> 2:41:28.680]  we've reached the point where they're just doubling down they're gonna fail now but
[2:41:28.680 --> 2:41:32.200]  what do they do to claw back power they're gonna pull something well and think about this they're
[2:41:32.200 --> 2:41:38.280]  desperate right i mean we now have caged while the cornered shrews these tiny little tiny minds
[2:41:38.280 --> 2:41:41.720]  that are they've been been trying to take over the world and they were getting away with it for
[2:41:41.720 --> 2:41:47.080]  some time now they're doubling and tripling down think about they're willing to kill american
[2:41:47.080 --> 2:41:52.840]  citizens now by denying them hydroxychloroquine what what's next i mean you are talking about
[2:41:52.840 --> 2:41:56.920]  there's murder of a hundred thousand americans in the nursing homes right well and what's that
[2:41:56.920 --> 2:42:00.440]  going to be how many people are going to be sick once we get into flu season and now they're
[2:42:00.440 --> 2:42:05.080]  going to push the flu vaccine which those study on the military here in america thousands of the
[2:42:05.080 --> 2:42:11.320]  military found a 38 increase in coronavirus amongst military that got the flu shot versus
[2:42:11.320 --> 2:42:16.600]  those that did not huge study out of japan yeah it blows your immunity it blows your immunity we've
[2:42:16.600 --> 2:42:21.720]  seen this a double blind study at japan saw that the flu shot those that got it um like i'm not
[2:42:21.720 --> 2:42:27.080]  going to tell men what boost your immunity okay but it's a family show but i mean this is out of
[2:42:27.080 --> 2:42:32.360]  control folks it's out of control and here's the point and all i do is show public science all i've
[2:42:32.360 --> 2:42:37.560]  ever done i'm a medical journalist i make sure i have multiple sources to anything that i've said
[2:42:37.560 --> 2:42:42.920]  on my show on youtube they do not have a ground to stand on i have done nothing but present
[2:42:42.920 --> 2:42:47.800]  scientific evidence of the points that i make on twitter all i've ever done you have a belief
[2:42:47.800 --> 2:42:52.520]  that truth will win i do being documented so i love how you're not rolling over in fear that you
[2:42:52.520 --> 2:42:56.520]  were censored that's why they censored us incrementally was to get others to be frayed
[2:42:56.520 --> 2:43:01.240]  and not stand up no everyone should speak up everyone has to speak up that's what our founding
[2:43:01.240 --> 2:43:05.880]  fathers demanded of us that's what jesus christ demanded of us that's what i mean whatever religion
[2:43:05.880 --> 2:43:11.560]  you're in every prophet that ever stood says if you can't stand in your truth then you don't deserve
[2:43:11.560 --> 2:43:17.720]  the kingdom of heaven man what are you doing here you you've been given every opportunity in the world
[2:43:17.720 --> 2:43:23.240]  to live in truth you can't let other people take that away from you and on my show i stood in the
[2:43:23.240 --> 2:43:27.240]  articles against me with their bullet points of what del big tree has said i said yep i did say
[2:43:27.240 --> 2:43:33.080]  that i did say that you're misrepresenting this i said that i said that and i have i'm not afraid
[2:43:33.080 --> 2:43:38.040]  of anything i stand and i will present evidence i will debate anyone in the medical establishment
[2:43:38.040 --> 2:43:43.480]  i will sit across from bill gates on cbs live and i will go toe to toe with that guy i know
[2:43:43.480 --> 2:43:48.200]  you would do it too i have known people like how can you be so bold because it's the truth
[2:43:48.200 --> 2:43:52.760]  he's got to make up lies he's got to remember what lie goes to what lie tonic voucher and look
[2:43:52.760 --> 2:43:57.560]  at this guy right he's got to tell us mass work but now all of a sudden i got to wear goggles
[2:43:57.560 --> 2:44:01.800]  he just admitted by the way i'm being attacked for i've said i think mass are a joke i don't think
[2:44:01.800 --> 2:44:06.360]  they project protect you and now he just admitted it by saying you need goggles if mass work why
[2:44:06.360 --> 2:44:11.000]  do i need goggles it's the whole point you can't touch your mask all the time you can't stick it in
[2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:15.800]  the in the in the ashtray of your car and then put it back on and walk in restaurant take off lay
[2:44:15.800 --> 2:44:19.800]  it on the table and then you've never you didn't wash it put it back on stick it on the counter
[2:44:19.800 --> 2:44:23.960]  while you're washing your hands put it back on you're wearing a dirty diaper around your face
[2:44:23.960 --> 2:44:29.000]  getting those viruses makes you weaker absolutely and then now goggles here's here's here's the
[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:34.760]  point folks i want to just make this perfectly clear if you are afraid of a point two six death
[2:44:34.760 --> 2:44:39.000]  rate of kovat 19 that's your right but don't believe that mass is going to roll over the
[2:44:39.000 --> 2:44:43.560]  flu with the cold and why would he know it's over he's right you do need goggles you need a mask
[2:44:43.560 --> 2:44:48.360]  but you know what you need you need a hazmat suit let's be honest no one that works with virus would
[2:44:48.360 --> 2:44:53.880]  ever you know i mean look at this gold leader look at these clothes this moron i mean they are
[2:44:53.880 --> 2:44:59.160]  here i'm losing control so now they're wearing masks oh perfect we've got to wear a mask i mean
[2:44:59.160 --> 2:45:04.600]  absolutely perfect this is the world we're going to and here's the point where hazmat suit
[2:45:04.600 --> 2:45:08.840]  we're gonna we're gonna mandate hazmat suits you know we're gonna we're gonna attempt to avoid
[2:45:08.840 --> 2:45:12.600]  herd immunity that much because we're this close man they need they they don't want to have natural
[2:45:12.600 --> 2:45:17.640]  burst they want to send pods that's it they that's in that's been written about in science fiction
[2:45:17.640 --> 2:45:21.560]  novels that used to be required reading have you looked into that i'll bet you anything nobody
[2:45:21.560 --> 2:45:26.440]  reads 1984 fahrenheit 451 brave new world they're not reading that in high school anymore there's
[2:45:26.440 --> 2:45:32.040]  no way you can't have to have kids embracing the idea that governments may actually not be out for
[2:45:32.040 --> 2:45:38.120]  your best interest just like george washington and thomas jepperson john adams told us right
[2:45:38.120 --> 2:45:42.120]  we're giving you a government it's going to be a mess it's a necessary evil because we don't want
[2:45:42.120 --> 2:45:46.520]  y'all killing each other you better watch out but you better watch out man this is this is a pitball
[2:45:46.520 --> 2:45:51.000]  from hell and if you feed it wrong you're gonna give you a government to block other worse that's
[2:45:51.000 --> 2:45:57.640]  it this is the best we could find it's still a piece of crap but man be very careful with it and
[2:45:57.640 --> 2:46:03.720]  now we see people that hate this our constitution they hate this country and they are you know
[2:46:03.720 --> 2:46:08.840]  they're pushing an agenda they've done you know to to say we don't need borders right let's just be a
[2:46:08.840 --> 2:46:13.560]  world let's also see the bread basket of the world let's just all this do this together yeah go ahead
[2:46:13.560 --> 2:46:17.960]  just pay me like yeah wear a mask you can't trust anything but then open up any political system
[2:46:17.960 --> 2:46:22.680]  that's right i mean oh and by the way while this this covet 19 you know what else is doing is

[2:46:55.000 --> 2:46:59.640]  say that that was the public science at that time in his modernized they've made mistakes let's bring
[2:46:59.640 --> 2:47:04.840]  this up obviously gates is a front guy but this isn't going the way he thought it would go it is not
[2:47:04.840 --> 2:47:09.880]  going the way he plans not going the way anyone planned they did not expect 50 of americans are
[2:47:09.880 --> 2:47:14.440]  now questioning using the vaccine 30 saying i won't go near that thing over my dead body and all
[2:47:14.440 --> 2:47:18.280]  these doctors coming out and all these doctors coming out but it's the greatest thing for me i mean
[2:47:18.280 --> 2:47:23.400]  i'll be honest it was clear there was an article came out media matters against me uh last thursday
[2:47:23.400 --> 2:47:27.960]  another one came out over the weekend cnn did a story with me in it on saturday my twitter went
[2:47:27.960 --> 2:47:33.080]  down thursday by monday facebook was threatening to take me down on wednesday youtube took me down
[2:47:33.080 --> 2:47:38.200]  i feel like i was the goal for the week but then these doctors like they're like angels for me they
[2:47:38.200 --> 2:47:43.320]  came out of nowhere they stood in front of the supreme court 17 million views and boom oh my god

[2:47:57.240 --> 2:48:03.720]  doctors on my show they're standing in truth they're treating people they care about people
[2:48:03.720 --> 2:48:07.240]  they're not throwing up their hands saying yeah everybody i put on a ventilator dies
[2:48:07.240 --> 2:48:12.200]  and by the way i want to i want to be perfectly clear i do celebrate and and say thank you to
[2:48:12.200 --> 2:48:17.240]  those frontline doctors that stood in front of dc i do not thank these doctors that are going along
[2:48:17.240 --> 2:48:21.400]  with protocols it essentially says i'm not going to give you anything i can't put you on an oxygen
[2:48:21.400 --> 2:48:25.160]  machine i'm going to stick you on a ventilator i'm going to kill you five more minutes till big

[2:48:33.560 --> 2:48:39.800]  modern theory or not the globalist controllers do and they constantly write about and talk about how
[2:48:40.360 --> 2:48:46.920]  they want to create a global crisis or a group of crises that force humans to quote evolve
[2:48:46.920 --> 2:48:51.800]  in a new better way that when you study how they actually want you to evolve you believe in that
[2:48:51.800 --> 2:48:57.480]  it is to stop having children emerge with silicon bodies and a post-human future talk about psychotic
[2:48:57.480 --> 2:49:04.440]  talk about creepy talk about crazy but they need an event like covid 19 to teach a mammal to wear
[2:49:04.440 --> 2:49:10.840]  some covering over its nose over its breathing tubes to set the precedent for the forced inoculations
[2:49:10.840 --> 2:49:17.080]  for the gmo for the 5g and for all the things that they admit will end our humanity as we know it

[2:50:58.120 --> 2:51:02.600]  final points you want to make people the point is this is that your body is your own you know
[2:51:02.600 --> 2:51:06.600]  your children are your children it's really that simple we are not property of the us government
[2:51:06.600 --> 2:51:11.160]  we are certainly not property of the chinese government which really is going to take over
[2:51:11.160 --> 2:51:15.000]  this country they're going to take over this country if we are hunkered down in our basements
[2:51:15.000 --> 2:51:20.040]  and not manufacturing anything not growing anything not producing anything then while
[2:51:20.040 --> 2:51:25.000]  we're in our basements china is going to have to take care of us and we are looking at losing
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:29.960]  the power that the united states of america has had this is beyond a medical issue this medical
[2:51:29.960 --> 2:51:34.120]  issue is getting in our way and it's clouding our thinking if china was attacking our borders
[2:51:34.120 --> 2:51:40.200]  right now we would risk millions of lives to go and fight and make sure that we maintain our property
[2:51:40.200 --> 2:51:45.480]  that we hold on to our jobs that we hold on to american exceptional you know understand they're
[2:51:45.480 --> 2:51:50.040]  open for business and we're all shut down right we're shut down because of 0.26 death rate a
[2:51:50.040 --> 2:51:54.600]  couple hundred thousand of us might die especially if we deny them hydroxychloroquine but we would
[2:51:54.600 --> 2:51:59.880]  risk far more than that and we should if we knew we were under threat over our will we're going to
[2:51:59.880 --> 2:52:05.160]  lose the greatest nation in the world and what are we being told why are we going to do it because

[2:53:05.640 --> 2:53:09.800]  happens next you're gonna see a massive onslaught by media you're gonna see everything under attack
[2:53:09.800 --> 2:53:13.800]  you're gonna see trump under massive massive attack because he just won't get along with the
[2:53:13.800 --> 2:53:19.320]  program you were gonna watch social media shutting down everybody everything in sight it's a total
[2:53:19.320 --> 2:53:25.240]  blitzkrieg it's just started they're playing their hands it is war the war is on and it's a war of
[2:53:25.240 --> 2:53:29.320]  truth i don't want people thinking i'm out there trying to call people to arms you are armed with
[2:53:29.320 --> 2:53:34.600]  a mouth you are armed with a mind you are armed with intuition use it you are being asked and

[2:53:45.000 --> 2:53:49.800]  you know we can't tell people what's right you know what you're supposed to do is they feel human
[2:53:49.800 --> 2:53:53.720]  will turning on they feel it turning on in such a way and they don't know what to do about the
[2:53:53.720 --> 2:53:58.680]  bunch of lizard brains they can inspire you they can't that's what they've decided we have got to
[2:53:58.680 --> 2:54:03.160]  muzzle you because you're making more sense to everybody in the world than we are we can't seem
[2:54:03.160 --> 2:54:08.280]  to language why you would want to poison everything we do successful everyone wants it because it's
[2:54:08.280 --> 2:54:12.520]  human that's right so who are these people that's right they don't know what to do with us so all
[2:54:12.520 --> 2:54:16.360]  we can do is try and shut them down and yet i shut them down they appear over here and over here

[2:56:02.760 --> 2:56:07.960]  heart gave out if you put somebody on a breathing tube with COVID-19 as a death
[2:56:07.960 --> 2:56:12.200]  sentence it's on record when everyone you know before they go to the hospital and get killed
[2:56:12.200 --> 2:56:17.160]  why are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities and blue states it's because they intubate
[2:56:17.160 --> 2:56:23.320]  them putting a tube in their lungs and COVID-19 is causing an autoimmune response and if you do
[2:56:23.320 --> 2:56:29.480]  that with oxygen the doctors are on records saying it will kill you but all these doctors in blue
[2:56:29.480 --> 2:56:35.160]  cities and blue states follow their orders and the minute i saw this report today i knew what i
[2:56:35.160 --> 2:56:39.080]  would be reading don't end up like vicki gibbs or everyone
[2:56:46.600 --> 2:56:55.640]  the alex jones show because there is a war on or you're mine i remember when i remember i remember
[2:56:55.640 --> 2:57:03.480]  when i lost my mind i could feel my ancestors are pleased with me but they know the war is here
[2:57:09.080 --> 2:57:13.960]  the enemy and their pedophile rings are being exposed their operations are being exposed but
[2:57:13.960 --> 2:57:21.000]  don't lie to yourself the enemy counter strike is coming make no mistake just because our ancestors
[2:57:21.000 --> 2:57:28.520]  are pleased with us does not mean we won the war yet dr nick baggage is taking over right now
[2:57:28.520 --> 2:57:33.640]  earth pulse dot com dr baggage we really appreciate you and love you we're glad you're here today
[2:57:33.640 --> 2:57:39.240]  what would you call this time in space we're in right now because i want to be optimistic i feel
[2:57:39.240 --> 2:57:43.080]  a great awakening happening but i also understand the empire will strike back
[2:57:43.080 --> 2:57:51.080]  yeah you know uh we've been uh talking about this for over 25 years you know this whole
[2:57:52.680 --> 2:57:59.800]  issue and what's been happening and you know i gotta say uh when i look at how it unfolded
[2:57:59.800 --> 2:58:03.400]  you know and i was thinking about the program today and how to how what you guys were doing
[2:58:03.400 --> 2:58:09.720]  is sort of the handoff and you know when you think about it it's really at the brink is where i
[2:58:09.720 --> 2:58:15.480]  would say we are and it's and we were looking forward you know you know kind of predicting this
[2:58:15.480 --> 2:58:21.480]  25 years ago and it's all the steps are there but i still like this pathological
[2:58:21.480 --> 2:58:27.880]  optimist terms of how i view it i think we have the opportunity uh to leap um into this without
[2:58:27.880 --> 2:58:33.720]  you know this defeat is oh i'm beaten down sort of viewpoint that so many have adopted and i believe
[2:58:33.720 --> 2:58:39.240]  that's part of the programming that's been going on is to take our energy away and take what
[2:58:39.240 --> 2:58:47.000]  we know i agree i feel victory yeah i do too i i mean i'm uh and i you know i always think we live
[2:58:47.000 --> 2:58:53.960]  in uh as i used to say in interesting times you know and i think we do and how we engage it and
[2:58:53.960 --> 2:58:59.320]  you know this is a short stop and i've said it recently on a lot of the programs 80 years maybe
[2:58:59.320 --> 2:59:03.640]  if we're lucky maybe a little longer you know short stop between interviews after that you've
[2:59:03.640 --> 2:59:11.640]  got eternity so what we do here matters and we should um really uh see ourselves being able
[2:59:11.640 --> 2:59:16.520]  to do more and i think that's it and that's not like i've been talking to about don't do the
[2:59:16.520 --> 2:59:21.320]  impossible you know i think it's impossible you're never going to do it do what you know is possible
[2:59:21.320 --> 2:59:27.160]  and there's a lot and i think people are falling into that and that is where i see the optimism
[2:59:27.160 --> 2:59:33.240]  as we come into our own uh individual power don't let globalists take it from us individually
[2:59:33.240 --> 2:59:38.120]  and that's where the sovereignty of the nation began with which is with sovereign individuals so
[2:59:38.120 --> 2:59:43.480]  that's i mean that's the nature of it that's why i love you know what we do here together you know to
[2:59:44.120 --> 2:59:45.880]  remind people of what we are
[2:59:45.880 --> 3:00:00.200]  and
[3:00:03.240 --> 3:00:09.480]  adorn a vaccine sound concerning we looked after the second dose at least 80 percent of
[3:00:09.480 --> 3:00:17.080]  participants experienced a systemic side effect ranging from severe chills to fevers so
[3:00:18.760 --> 3:00:27.080]  are these vaccines safe well the uh the FDA not being pressured will
[3:00:28.440 --> 3:00:34.680]  look hard at that the FDA is the gold standard of regulators uh and their current guidance on this
[3:00:34.680 --> 3:00:44.920]  if they stick with that is is very very appropriate uh and you know the the the the side effects were
[3:00:44.920 --> 3:00:52.200]  not super severe that is it didn't cause permanent health problems for uh the things there they you
[3:00:52.200 --> 3:00:59.400]  know maderna did have to go with the fairly high dose and so uh you know to get the antibodies
[3:00:59.400 --> 3:01:07.320]  some of the other vaccines are going able to go with lower doses to get responses that are
[3:01:07.320 --> 3:01:13.320]  are pretty high including the the jnj and the Pfizer and so there's a lot of characteristics
[3:01:13.320 --> 3:01:20.680]  of these vaccines um it's great that we have multiple of them uh that are going out there and
[3:01:20.680 --> 3:01:25.400]  yes i think you know the data better than i do but the bill bill that the data show that everybody
[3:01:25.400 --> 3:01:33.240]  with a high dose had a side effect yeah but some of that is is not dramatic where you know it's
[3:01:33.240 --> 3:01:39.000]  just you know super painful but yes there we need to make sure there's not severe side effects the
[3:01:39.000 --> 3:01:47.960]  FDA uh i i i think we'll do a good job of that uh despite the pressure how many doses of the vaccine
[3:01:47.960 --> 3:01:55.240]  will we need well none of the vaccines at this point appear like they'll work with a single dose
[3:01:55.240 --> 3:02:01.880]  that was the the hope at the very beginning uh maybe one of them particularly in the second
[3:02:01.880 --> 3:02:08.840]  generation won't surprise us we hope just two although in the elderly sometimes uh it it takes
[3:02:08.840 --> 3:02:14.360]  more and and so making sure we have lots of elderly people in the trial will give us that data
[3:02:16.200 --> 3:02:22.760]  you've said some more than seven billion doses that's what we'll need well if if what you're
[3:02:22.760 --> 3:02:27.240]  trying to do
[3:02:27.240 --> 3:02:34.440]  unbelievable can uh unbelievable you know when you think about um just you know sort of how
[3:02:34.440 --> 3:02:42.360]  this is all being rolled out you know we've had um chases for vaccines for aids for instance for
[3:02:42.360 --> 3:02:48.200]  decades and no result and they expect to roll something out in the short term and and i just
[3:02:48.200 --> 3:02:56.200]  don't see it i don't see how that can possibly occur when when i look forward into um what's
[3:02:56.200 --> 3:03:04.520]  happening in this um entire rollout it's really a a violation of us and what it's connected to
[3:03:04.520 --> 3:03:13.000]  and when you look back for the historically on where all this began um it's pretty predictable
[3:03:13.000 --> 3:03:20.440]  actually uh where we are at the moment uh is it the end no i don't think so i think there's a
[3:03:20.440 --> 3:03:27.400]  lot of potential within this if we can remember a little more about what we are not respond to the
[3:03:27.400 --> 3:03:36.040]  panic party but really look at all of this much much differently and i think that's what we're
[3:03:36.040 --> 3:03:42.280]  missing in a lot of a lot of what's happening right now and so you know going forward uh
[3:03:42.280 --> 3:03:49.480]  as we approach um the next year what's going to happen what do we see happening well i think we're
[3:03:49.480 --> 3:03:55.800]  going to see periodic up and down the fire drill of getting people to think things are calming down
[3:03:55.800 --> 3:04:04.280]  and then rolling it back up as um the programming continues you know but it's really a fear driven
[3:04:04.280 --> 3:04:11.480]  thing this is what i've noticed uh as i go around my city in Anchorage um and we're way different than
[3:04:11.480 --> 3:04:18.040]  a lot of the big cities as i see uh the news feeds from around the country uh and the alternative news
[3:04:18.040 --> 3:04:25.560]  fees quite frankly but when i when i look at what's happening it's the fear level and and i see that
[3:04:25.560 --> 3:04:33.800]  expressed in lots of different ways and it's it's kind of odd to me because a lot of conservatives
[3:04:33.800 --> 3:04:39.960]  right now aren't speaking up and i understand that because the left is crazy i mean they'll beat you up
[3:04:39.960 --> 3:04:46.360]  in the street so i get that but what i would say too is the polls are wrong all the polling you're
[3:04:46.360 --> 3:04:52.760]  saying is wrong i think there's a major backlash and people aren't speaking their truth right now
[3:04:52.760 --> 3:04:57.960]  because we're afraid i mean i look around and i go oh you know certain crowds you don't want to wear
[3:04:57.960 --> 3:05:04.040]  a a magnet at you know i mean they're gonna hang you so i get that all right and we all get that
[3:05:04.040 --> 3:05:09.800]  and but this is really um the beauty of the ballot box and what they're trying to shut down too
[3:05:09.800 --> 3:05:15.560]  not trump i don't believe that but this whole idea of getting it into a position where it can be
[3:05:15.560 --> 3:05:23.000]  manipulated now i see that um i see a lot of that possibility so that's where we need to be sharp
[3:05:23.000 --> 3:05:30.840]  now the other thing i would say is uh the splintering of the cia you remember that that was jfk you
[3:05:30.840 --> 3:05:37.800]  know before they took him out he was going to splinter the cia into 10 000 pieces and then they
[3:05:37.800 --> 3:05:44.840]  poof he was gone and so was his brother not too long after what were they up to what did they know
[3:05:45.960 --> 3:05:53.880]  they knew about the deep state then what kind of indictments might be coming now in this moment
[3:05:53.880 --> 3:06:00.200]  this moment that we're all experiencing together you see because they want us distracted looking
[3:06:00.200 --> 3:06:05.960]  one way you know that's two years overdue all that jfk info was supposed to be released two years ago
[3:06:05.960 --> 3:06:15.000]  we still don't have it hey donald trump dig it out what's the rest what's the rest of this story i
[3:06:15.000 --> 3:06:21.720]  think that's gonna be our september october november surprise i at least i hope so i hope
[3:06:22.280 --> 3:06:30.280]  that this time perhaps in this moment we see the deep state revealed perhaps in this moment
[3:06:30.280 --> 3:06:36.040]  that we see a real shift in what's happening pay attention you're the tip of the spear we'll
[3:06:36.040 --> 3:06:42.200]  be right back this is nick faggot let's go to one in connecticut you're on the air thanks for

[3:09:59.160 --> 3:10:04.520]  whenever you go there to my product page you actually link straight on in and you know what
[3:10:04.520 --> 3:10:10.360]  what i want to say about some of this you know when we were back and uh jim rodrick and i wrote
[3:10:10.360 --> 3:10:15.400]  earth rising earth rising too it was kind of predicting sort of the matrix that was being
[3:10:15.400 --> 3:10:22.440]  woven together uh you know this kind of digital gulag that we're now in and here's these are the
[3:10:22.440 --> 3:10:28.760]  next steps you're seeing unfolded because it takes a panic party an injection of fear you know where
[3:10:28.760 --> 3:10:32.920]  your neighbors are spying on each other and blowing the whistle on you if you don't have a mask or
[3:10:32.920 --> 3:10:40.200]  whatever it is and this was like opportunistic city you know in terms of that because power in the
[3:10:40.200 --> 3:10:46.840]  21st century is knowledge right and when you have digital knowledge that's powerful and they figured
[3:10:46.840 --> 3:10:54.120]  it out in the big uh analytical um uh work that was done Cambridge Analytica and now all the options
[3:10:54.120 --> 3:11:00.200]  from that because big data what we predicted was going to happen has arrived ladies and gentlemen
[3:11:00.200 --> 3:11:08.200]  in its control it's all about control it's about manipulation it's about making us all move like
[3:11:08.200 --> 3:11:15.320]  lemmings jumping off the cliff whatever panic uh leads us and that leads us always the wrong way
[3:11:15.320 --> 3:11:23.320]  when we succumb to that now fear boop excites the reptilian brain and says pay attention you
[3:11:23.320 --> 3:11:29.400]  know that's what it's for even in the 21st century although you know the same adrenaline rush
[3:11:29.400 --> 3:11:35.960]  shouldn't happen and the fatigue you know the adrenal fatigue that a lot of people are experiencing
[3:11:35.960 --> 3:11:43.240]  from just the up and down and in and out of all of this nonsense flooding at us at an incredible
[3:11:43.240 --> 3:11:49.960]  rate so part of the focus has to be on calming because we're doing damage you know with the
[3:11:49.960 --> 3:11:55.640]  last cost yes was talking about damage we're doing a lot of self damage in this instance so
[3:11:55.640 --> 3:12:03.640]  so the breath take a breath uh and recognize that we're in a very powerful moment right now this
[3:12:03.640 --> 3:12:08.440]  moment the one we're in right now not the one we did the one we're going to do the one we're in
[3:12:08.440 --> 3:12:15.800]  right now and how we execute what we do next the possible what each of us do does next and I want
[3:12:15.800 --> 3:12:21.560]  to frame this a little bit uh from where I left off a little bit last week you know I talked about
[3:12:21.560 --> 3:12:26.520]  slavery you know the slavery is kind of in the news and I want to get it get into that again
[3:12:26.520 --> 3:12:32.760]  someone remind people what I said last week and draw it back into this week slavery you know the
[3:12:32.760 --> 3:12:43.960]  civil war 1861 to 1865 and that's ended and then women's suffrage later but in 1890s in the 1890s
[3:12:43.960 --> 3:12:50.200]  there was a us supreme court decision everybody forgets this where they decided that taxing labor
[3:12:50.200 --> 3:12:58.120]  income tax on labor your labor your work was unconstitutional because it was slavery
[3:12:59.320 --> 3:13:07.960]  think about this ladies and gentlemen a little over a hundred years ago it was slavery in america
[3:13:07.960 --> 3:13:17.800]  the tax a man or woman's labor wow think about this now no one's asking for reparations for being
[3:13:17.800 --> 3:13:23.640]  turned into slaves when we did the constitutional amendment you don't kind of reverse that because
[3:13:23.640 --> 3:13:29.000]  we did that in 1913 when we brought in the income tax and made it constitutional to be a slave
[3:13:30.600 --> 3:13:36.520]  I'm not kidding about this this is how it unfolded and how it went and we forget it if you don't
[3:13:36.520 --> 3:13:43.080]  have multi-generational memory right and you know this is part of the forgetting and the controlling
[3:13:43.080 --> 3:13:49.000]  now you have but here's the thing you didn't know a lot about people individually like you do now
[3:13:49.000 --> 3:13:55.320]  with greater and greater what I've called for 25 years greater and greater resolution you know
[3:13:55.320 --> 3:14:02.600]  like how clear you see the picture how great you see the hear the sound you know see think about
[3:14:02.600 --> 3:14:10.120]  this for a moment the finer the resolution the more information you have so in a digital world
[3:14:10.120 --> 3:14:16.760]  where you're collecting data 300 data points someone who lived with your five years knows
[3:14:16.760 --> 3:14:21.720]  all about you that's what you get for 300 data points everybody has that in the digital world
[3:14:21.720 --> 3:14:28.440]  3000 get you a model a predictive model that somebody lives with you for 20 years can predict
[3:14:28.440 --> 3:14:36.120]  what you do but that 3000 data points will give more data than someone needs to predict better
[3:14:36.120 --> 3:14:43.160]  than you will predict about yourself stop for a moment that's power you see that's a lot of power
[3:14:43.160 --> 3:14:48.440]  in the hands of people taking our data like they're rummaging through your underwear drawer and
[3:14:48.440 --> 3:14:52.600]  digging through your closet and going through all your private papers and they just kicked in your
[3:14:52.600 --> 3:14:59.560]  digital doorway and none of us blink and all of us have been violated and now they want to
[3:14:59.560 --> 3:15:05.000]  violate our bodies again something they said in the u.s supreme court was unconstitutional for
[3:15:05.000 --> 3:15:10.200]  women that want to have an abortion right and a lot of us disagree with that but now they're
[3:15:10.200 --> 3:15:16.360]  saying again they're saying and what's on steroids that are saying everybody's body needs to be
[3:15:16.360 --> 3:15:22.440]  violated by whatever poison they want to pump into you and demand you take and participate in
[3:15:22.440 --> 3:15:29.000]  at the same time you have all of these global organizations from the world health organizations
[3:15:29.000 --> 3:15:36.920]  to the u.n to the democrats in the house trying to slide it into the panic bill of bailout and
[3:15:36.920 --> 3:15:43.640]  you know it's about digital currency being plugged in and all the filthy looper you know the coins
[3:15:43.640 --> 3:15:51.000]  and the currency going away we predicted this long ago this is the excuse and then every single
[3:15:51.000 --> 3:15:57.480]  data point everything you consume everything you spend your money on because that's how you
[3:15:57.480 --> 3:16:04.840]  translate your life energy in the world you get aid and currency right which is which is the paper
[3:16:05.720 --> 3:16:12.840]  or now maybe the digital event that connects you to the four things that constitute real
[3:16:12.840 --> 3:16:23.480]  wealth we are being looted on every front under a delusion of of vast massive proportions it's
[3:16:23.480 --> 3:16:32.440]  not conspiracy theory it's called history for goodness sake history playing out in the 21st
[3:16:32.440 --> 3:16:38.600]  century they don't even teach history in school you know kids who are coming out of high school
[3:16:38.600 --> 3:16:45.320]  today coming out of college they don't know what the cold war was with and what it all
[3:16:45.320 --> 3:16:50.040]  meant and how it happened they don't know any of our history and when you go back to this
[3:16:50.040 --> 3:16:57.560]  part of history who knows it who studies it who teaches it right they don't for good reason they
[3:16:57.560 --> 3:17:04.120]  don't from their perspective and very bad reasons for march because the democratic republic that
[3:17:04.120 --> 3:17:12.120]  began a little over 200 years ago has been sliced away you see one slice at a time because what's
[3:17:12.120 --> 3:17:20.440]  the target what was the targeting colonialization natural resources right on the backs of whatever
[3:17:20.440 --> 3:17:26.280]  labor you can enslave when you arrive and that was it let's get back into history after the breaks
[3:17:26.280 --> 3:17:31.960]  this is dr. nick baggage you're listening to info wars and we are changing the way we see the world
[3:17:31.960 --> 3:17:36.920]  because the world needs to change this is thick baggage we'll be right back i know what we'll do
[3:17:36.920 --> 3:17:42.040]  to make them conform to our cult we'll tell them to wear masks or they're gonna die and then
[3:17:42.040 --> 3:17:46.280]  we'll release the pressure for a while and bring it back and squeeze it harder and release it yet
[3:17:46.280 --> 3:17:50.760]  and we will be the virtuous second ones will be the angels even though our lord and master
[3:17:50.760 --> 3:17:59.880]  bill gates helped fund the whole covid-19 oh no don't seduce me that's right that's the code word
[3:17:59.880 --> 3:18:08.280]  for bill gates's operation he carries out with his good little buddy dr. Fauci in the surgeon cult
[3:18:08.280 --> 3:18:12.600]  because you know for girls there's five different types of villains they secretly desire in the
[3:18:12.600 --> 3:18:20.280]  romance novels one of the vampire the werewolf the billionaire and and who else oh that's what
[3:18:20.280 --> 3:18:24.920]  there's the surgeon and then there's one other one and it's so much fun to be ruled over by these
[3:18:24.920 --> 3:18:30.920]  psychotic psychopaths it's so good to know that there are masters and they're coming to rape us
[3:18:30.920 --> 3:18:40.920]  with their inoculations psychopaths are so hot oh yeah
[3:18:45.640 --> 3:18:50.920]  where the hell did this water come from

[3:21:05.160 --> 3:21:14.360]  and welcome back and just before the uh break i was talking a little bit about the history you
[3:21:14.360 --> 3:21:19.720]  know because history when you think about coming to the new world it was about natural resources
[3:21:19.720 --> 3:21:25.320]  right through the real wealth because in europe everyone lived in these feudal systems where
[3:21:25.320 --> 3:21:28.760]  they really didn't own anything they were just serfs on the land they get a little bit of what
[3:21:28.760 --> 3:21:33.400]  they produced in place to build a house and that's basically it they didn't even own they couldn't
[3:21:33.400 --> 3:21:39.320]  even hunt there you know something on the game and so when the new world happened which was kind
[3:21:39.320 --> 3:21:46.120]  of this whole thing that's too long to tell this story but basically think about it as a grab for
[3:21:46.120 --> 3:21:51.880]  resources right and but people came here and then they had the opportunity and they said hey you know
[3:21:51.880 --> 3:21:57.560]  what uh we don't like this the strings that are attached and the kings and queens of europe can
[3:21:57.560 --> 3:22:02.920]  keep it you know and so we had revolutions and we broke away from this and did a different program
[3:22:02.920 --> 3:22:07.960]  here and and we learned a lot in 200 years and the way we ran our deal but it was always about
[3:22:07.960 --> 3:22:13.720]  natural resources think about it we had home setting you can go out and claim 160 acres
[3:22:14.520 --> 3:22:21.160]  that's a really decent track to land you know as tracks of land go and anybody's book that's like a
[3:22:21.720 --> 3:22:28.280]  quarter mile by a quarter mile you know it's a big chunk and so when you think about that
[3:22:28.280 --> 3:22:37.160]  uh land and then you could um if you improve the land for seven years five out of the seven years
[3:22:37.160 --> 3:22:43.480]  you got to keep it and it was yours and that's how it worked and it worked that way in alaska
[3:22:43.480 --> 3:22:49.160]  up until the early 1970s i remember i remember they were still letting home setting happen here
[3:22:49.160 --> 3:22:57.800]  and and it was up down to like five acre home sites and uh five acre trade sites and for businesses
[3:22:57.800 --> 3:23:02.920]  and you could do that on blm land it was kind of cool and you could go out and stake blm land
[3:23:02.920 --> 3:23:08.600]  that wasn't appropriated and and you had to improve it and then you you you could survey it and then
[3:23:08.600 --> 3:23:14.200]  you owned uh that you could apply for the pat and get the title and so you could move public lands
[3:23:14.200 --> 3:23:19.560]  into private hands it was always part of our heritage until the 1970 we stopped it and the
[3:23:19.560 --> 3:23:25.000]  thought was that that that there wouldn't be much public land you know constitutionally it was supposed
[3:23:25.000 --> 3:23:31.080]  to be post office military installations you know you know that was kind of it and then they created
[3:23:31.080 --> 3:23:37.240]  parks and preserves and that took a big chunk and then you know and then they you know continue
[3:23:37.240 --> 3:23:43.560]  to try and reach more and whittle away at the rights that ran with the land either energy rights
[3:23:43.560 --> 3:23:52.040]  oil and gas the minerals the wealth the wealth of the nation is held in the land natural resources
[3:23:52.040 --> 3:23:58.520]  the labor of its people the creativity in which we apply our label to make money called entrepreneurship
[3:23:58.520 --> 3:24:03.320]  which is one of the third factor of economic production i often talk about it and then capital
[3:24:03.320 --> 3:24:08.440]  equipment which things that make other things you like a shovel makes a ditch like the factory
[3:24:08.440 --> 3:24:15.080]  makes a widget these are capital capital equipment it's not money remember this money is the fluid
[3:24:15.080 --> 3:24:22.920]  between all those things that are real wealth and the battle in the nation is the wealth of nations
[3:24:23.880 --> 3:24:30.600]  what is the wealth what's your wealth when it's all stripped away is it some piece of paper you
[3:24:30.600 --> 3:24:36.840]  know a stock certificate you can wave around and when things get bad you can't even well you can
[3:24:36.840 --> 3:24:41.800]  start a fire with it but you can't do other things with it you want to stock up on toilet paper for
[3:24:41.800 --> 3:24:48.040]  that but stock certificates get really worthless you know and and in that kind of a scenario but
[3:24:48.040 --> 3:24:54.600]  does a farm or a tractor or a tank of fuel no because that's capital equipment that all goes
[3:24:54.600 --> 3:24:59.400]  together and make something you know oh and the land is the land and your labor is your labor
[3:24:59.400 --> 3:25:06.280]  and your creativity for all the gathers are entrepreneurship see most people 95 96 100 years
[3:25:06.280 --> 3:25:15.720]  ago had all that as part of their wealth package not a 401k not a bunch of paper but real stuff
[3:25:15.720 --> 3:25:21.480]  okay so this is an important thing think about they didn't have a lot of gold because that was
[3:25:21.480 --> 3:25:27.640]  again the medium of exchange in those days just a different medium of exchange between real wealth
[3:25:27.640 --> 3:25:33.560]  things that sustain us and build and are created all that so we need to remember that but in the
[3:25:33.560 --> 3:25:39.640]  context of what we're talking about in slavery we were all slaves and then we made ourselves slaves
[3:25:39.640 --> 3:25:47.080]  by the income tax that started as a one percent tax on the first on the first money you made that
[3:25:47.080 --> 3:25:56.360]  was over 25 thousand dollars in 1913 my grandfather was making uh seven dollars uh well yeah seven
[3:25:56.360 --> 3:26:08.280]  dollars uh a week you know the thought of making 25 000 a year was the furthest thing from most
[3:26:08.280 --> 3:26:13.400]  people's mind ever now my grandfather was an underground miner in those days they made very
[3:26:13.400 --> 3:26:18.920]  much money maybe it was up a little bit by then because we were in you know in the head and into
[3:26:18.920 --> 3:26:27.320]  world war one shortly thereafter but the point i'm making is nobody was affected by it unless you
[3:26:27.320 --> 3:26:31.480]  may use a amount of money you made over a over a half million which is absurd amount of money
[3:26:31.480 --> 3:26:36.760]  it'd be like making 60 million today they tax you three percent back so it was like minimal money
[3:26:37.320 --> 3:26:42.440]  but look where it is now and the leftists are talking 70 percent you make over a couple hundred
[3:26:42.440 --> 3:26:50.040]  grand you know this is like serious change now is it slavery how you tell me you know if you're
[3:26:50.040 --> 3:26:55.800]  making a couple hundred grand or you're making 50 grand and uh you know if they're taking from you
[3:26:55.800 --> 3:27:01.480]  20 percent of your of your labor of your life energy the thing that's really valuable as i've
[3:27:01.480 --> 3:27:07.720]  said here before are they just grabbing that chunk for your 80 years that you might get here and
[3:27:07.720 --> 3:27:12.840]  deciding it's appropriate steal that from you because that's really what we're talking about
[3:27:12.840 --> 3:27:20.120]  is how much of that should these guys take from us our life energy and the transformation of money
[3:27:20.120 --> 3:27:28.440]  the medium between our labor and creativity our life energy they steal this in an income tax
[3:27:29.720 --> 3:27:34.520]  and and we don't even consider it in this way anymore as part of our normal thinking
[3:27:34.520 --> 3:27:40.760]  because we gave that normal thinking up two generations ago my grandfather was always so
[3:27:40.760 --> 3:27:45.000]  uptight about so many things you know i think about it well what did he had got to see you know
[3:27:45.000 --> 3:27:51.720]  he was getting a horse moving in 1890 when he was born and being transported from wherever
[3:27:52.280 --> 3:27:57.640]  you know he was uh going and i saw where he was born in it you know and my my cousins still live
[3:27:57.640 --> 3:28:03.560]  there uh in croatia right i visited there a few years ago with my oldest son you know and just
[3:28:03.560 --> 3:28:09.720]  the whole route back to the and i wrote a paper on it actually the you know grabbing back the roots
[3:28:09.720 --> 3:28:15.000]  where does our democracy come from what kind of people helped create it you know and how did that
[3:28:15.000 --> 3:28:23.160]  go and he came here in 1906 16 years old and stuck around and uh my dad became a congressman
[3:28:23.160 --> 3:28:28.280]  a state senator my brother a u.s senator my other brother a state senator you know people are doing
[3:28:28.280 --> 3:28:33.320]  things in one generation when they show up and work hard and that was the way it was they my
[3:28:33.320 --> 3:28:39.880]  grandfather came to ellis island you know wow what a place you know and it was hard as hell i can
[3:28:39.880 --> 3:28:45.560]  tell you um and he would have told you to you told me um and sort of my great grandmother who came
[3:28:45.560 --> 3:28:52.840]  here um back in the late 1800s you know but you know going back in time and discovering all of our
[3:28:52.840 --> 3:29:00.440]  roots is an important thing for perspective but in this moment today is this incredible opportunity
[3:29:00.440 --> 3:29:08.840]  to put the brakes on the the raid on our digital doorways which is what's happened you know all
[3:29:08.840 --> 3:29:14.200]  these idiots standing in front of the congress being asked questions by other idiots trying to
[3:29:14.200 --> 3:29:21.880]  mask a raid as democracy you know this is crazy ladies and gentlemen we're being hijacked our
[3:29:21.880 --> 3:29:29.960]  democracy our republic is being taken from us in front of us by people taking the public squares
[3:29:29.960 --> 3:29:35.320]  if they own it because that's what's also changed so when you think about the digital doorway think
[3:29:35.320 --> 3:29:41.320]  about the digital public square and get this wrapped in the right direction we own all of our data
[3:29:41.960 --> 3:29:47.640]  and anyone who takes that data and uses it to manipulate us to persuade us in any way
[3:29:48.600 --> 3:29:55.400]  violate our very essence in terms of civil liberties and who we are and they masquerade
[3:29:55.400 --> 3:30:04.280]  with all this social nonsense as if we're one big squishy blob of humanity and we're not
[3:30:04.280 --> 3:30:11.160]  we're individual sovereign souls creating the image and likeness of a creator energetically
[3:30:11.160 --> 3:30:19.560]  and consciously and through this thing that links us so profoundly and we need to act like it

[3:34:33.480 --> 3:34:58.120]  of the beast resist to be enslaved you're listening to the alex jones show live from austin texas
[3:34:58.120 --> 3:35:05.880]  broadcasting worldwide it's nick baggage you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:35:09.960 --> 3:35:15.480]  and welcome back you know i was thinking about this during the break you know and i love working
[3:35:15.480 --> 3:35:23.480]  with alex and uh you know i think about him as the most most misunderstood radio talk show host
[3:35:23.480 --> 3:35:30.040]  in america about that because you have to know someone over their block of their time you know
[3:35:30.040 --> 3:35:34.840]  on the planet to know a person you know and those who've listened to alex a long time have been
[3:35:34.840 --> 3:35:39.640]  associated in the long time you know the heart of the man you know and that's what matters and i i
[3:35:39.640 --> 3:35:45.720]  know all these really unusual characters you know i i laugh about it a lot because they're really
[3:35:45.720 --> 3:35:52.680]  unusual from all every angle you can imagine from my friends the wheeler brothers a couple of wild
[3:35:52.680 --> 3:35:58.200]  miners in alaska that i've known for uh almost 40 years you know and good friends of mine and
[3:35:58.200 --> 3:36:03.720]  they're now in their 70s uh you know i think about alex i think about some of the heads of state
[3:36:03.720 --> 3:36:09.800]  i've met in my life and i've known and a lot of people i've known and what i do know is that the
[3:36:09.800 --> 3:36:18.280]  heart of each of us that connects us that that is the deal you see and a lot of the things we do
[3:36:18.280 --> 3:36:23.960]  are totally different they seem really radically different but they don't define us they're just
[3:36:23.960 --> 3:36:33.640]  small expressions of us if i can say that but the heart of a person is what i've always connected
[3:36:33.640 --> 3:36:41.000]  and so it makes for a lot of unusual friends and i appreciate that and and here's what also i know
[3:36:41.000 --> 3:36:48.680]  is i've met uh everyone who's connected in this way has tremendous power most don't
[3:36:48.680 --> 3:36:55.400]  remember i nice i say this a lot of my work today is about remembering helping others remember
[3:36:55.400 --> 3:37:02.360]  remembering myself more about what we are in the expression of what we see in the world around us
[3:37:02.360 --> 3:37:07.000]  so we're not lost in what we see in the world around us we get confused and we think that's us
[3:37:07.000 --> 3:37:12.760]  playing the game in the world around us through the body that our soul occupies in the world
[3:37:12.760 --> 3:37:20.200]  around us now think about it in this moment you get to decide stuff that's called choice free will
[3:37:20.200 --> 3:37:27.160]  that's pretty powerful think about it it's really pretty powerful if you apply it fully with the
[3:37:27.160 --> 3:37:35.320]  dimension of knowing who and what you are that's that's the uh uh essence of it you know and that's
[3:37:35.320 --> 3:37:42.520]  also the essence of the dark side of it because what you choose when you find that power within you
[3:37:44.680 --> 3:37:50.760]  is a lot of uh catch to that and so that's why i always say ask for grace ask for wisdom
[3:37:51.480 --> 3:37:55.560]  and ask for knowledge and make sure they're all wrapped together because it really works
[3:37:55.560 --> 3:38:01.320]  better that way but but i want to say this um about what i was saying earlier about sovereignty
[3:38:01.320 --> 3:38:08.280]  and the individual and the currency between the wealth and the things that are of the earth but
[3:38:08.280 --> 3:38:14.200]  what people who are of the earth in the world lost in the world for them that's all there is
[3:38:14.200 --> 3:38:19.640]  so the bigger the pile of chips you know somehow that's it and then they want to take their what
[3:38:19.640 --> 3:38:27.640]  they think is their consciousness their brain programming and pump it into some kind of AI
[3:38:27.640 --> 3:38:33.800]  and preserve their essence you know because they don't get it you don't need to do all that it
[3:38:33.800 --> 3:38:40.920]  already is um and but here's the fear that's running that programming are so much i mean think
[3:38:40.920 --> 3:38:47.480]  about this i was saying it during the break um in a little more colorful language with the guys
[3:38:47.480 --> 3:38:53.000]  working with me today and i and i'm thinking about this and i'm going you know they are really scared
[3:38:53.000 --> 3:38:58.600]  you really think about the deep state because with a guy like trump at the helm he might
[3:38:59.240 --> 3:39:04.600]  break it up into 10 000 pieces of truth but he better roll it out fast the public's gonna have
[3:39:04.600 --> 3:39:12.360]  to digest this and they're very quickly shutting down the ability to hear it by turning off everything
[3:39:12.360 --> 3:39:17.880]  even the communication links from the president of the united states stop and fathom that for just
[3:39:17.880 --> 3:39:25.560]  a moment contemplate that for a moment mainstream media is thinking about turning him off don't let
[3:39:25.560 --> 3:39:35.560]  that happen for goodness sake now is the time and now is the hour mr president to pull the pin
[3:39:35.560 --> 3:39:43.800]  and release the files open the files let truth open the eyes of the nation again time to break
[3:39:43.800 --> 3:39:53.560]  the back of the deep state now is that time look at uh the last 50 years were being looted we've
[3:39:53.560 --> 3:40:00.440]  been looted for the last 200 we were looted before the whole point was to loot this hemisphere and
[3:40:00.440 --> 3:40:08.760]  hand it off to the spanish and portuguese royalty when the hope split the new world you know and
[3:40:08.760 --> 3:40:14.600]  then the british got involved and kind of carved out a chunk and then we decided hey to ekvitalia
[3:40:14.600 --> 3:40:21.000]  and you know then we started taking it away from them you know think about all of the things that
[3:40:21.000 --> 3:40:25.720]  unfolded as is our let go of alaska why do you do that because you figured hey i better sell it
[3:40:25.720 --> 3:40:30.840]  because otherwise we're probably going to take it and uh you know i mean it was think about the
[3:40:30.840 --> 3:40:36.200]  nature of history within its context and we come to different conclusions because really about well
[3:40:36.200 --> 3:40:41.640]  even in alaska the british crown owned 25 percent of british petroleum all the way through the middle
[3:40:41.640 --> 3:40:47.160]  80s i believe and and they were pumping alaskan oil you know it's producing at that time two
[3:40:47.160 --> 3:40:51.400]  million barrels of oil a day so it was still going to the british crown indirectly through
[3:40:51.400 --> 3:40:57.480]  british petroleum it's like the handoff oh shoot we got caught by the ground let's build a corporation
[3:40:57.480 --> 3:41:03.320]  let's bury it in that you know think about the way of layering create some new words i call it
[3:41:03.320 --> 3:41:08.840]  corporation that sounds good let's do that you know but the point of the matter is you create
[3:41:08.840 --> 3:41:13.320]  new entities now you don't have a sovereign crown you have don't want you don't want sovereign
[3:41:13.320 --> 3:41:17.240]  individuals you're running around making all the decisions better some sovereign corporations
[3:41:17.240 --> 3:41:21.880]  that can run around and not be liable for anything you know but here's what they did that's what they
[3:41:21.880 --> 3:41:28.520]  did created all of these things um and got us further and further and further removed from
[3:41:28.520 --> 3:41:34.040]  the things that really represent wealth and then they squandered um our money and handed her off
[3:41:34.040 --> 3:41:40.760]  the bankers that was part of 1913 too and think of the banker game you know that's a hell of a game
[3:41:41.560 --> 3:41:47.080]  you take a doll you take a hundred dollars in and then you loan out a thousand on credit cards so
[3:41:47.080 --> 3:41:52.840]  you pay somebody a dollar a year if you're lucky for your hundred bucks and then they loan out a
[3:41:52.840 --> 3:42:01.000]  thousand and they collect uh you know 180 bucks and you know here we are you know and and they do
[3:42:01.000 --> 3:42:05.880]  that with the nation and the national debt on steroids more or less you know so this whole thing
[3:42:06.520 --> 3:42:14.920]  is a looting and then a way to enslave the future generations to paying back a borrowed debt from
[3:42:14.920 --> 3:42:20.760]  fictional money to take real assets and concentrate them in fewer and fewer hands and then lately we
[3:42:20.760 --> 3:42:26.120]  saw them hand out like a couple hundred grand per family of four although families supported and see
[3:42:26.120 --> 3:42:31.400]  it to corporate america once again we saw it in other forms you know the 20 year war what 20 year
[3:42:31.400 --> 3:42:36.440]  war you know the one in afghanistan and iraq we've been in and all over the world we've been in this
[3:42:36.440 --> 3:42:42.120]  costed trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars you know like we just spent the last few
[3:42:42.120 --> 3:42:49.160]  months only we did it on the installment plan to a debt our future generations for what for
[3:42:49.160 --> 3:42:56.840]  people that don't even want us there why why are we there what are our interests really what are
[3:42:56.840 --> 3:43:03.400]  our interest in these places and these entanglements that squander our national wealth trump recently
[3:43:03.400 --> 3:43:09.400]  is pulling troops out of germany why is he doing it germans can pay for their own defense for god's
[3:43:09.400 --> 3:43:13.400]  sake you know why do they have good schools and their people aren't enslaved to student
[3:43:13.400 --> 3:43:17.160]  debt in their universities because they don't have to pay for their military because we have
[3:43:17.160 --> 3:43:24.120]  and instead we have lousy medical care and our next generation enslaved in student debt worrying
[3:43:24.120 --> 3:43:31.560]  about their jobs now they're going to pay it in this digital gulag right why is it why are the
[3:43:31.560 --> 3:43:39.720]  elites making russia and china our enemy today because they're not playing ball wow china i don't
[3:43:39.720 --> 3:43:45.000]  like china okay i i say that now they like their political system you know they run capitalism as
[3:43:45.000 --> 3:43:50.840]  an economics about like a political system russia russia is an emerging democracy still got a ways
[3:43:50.840 --> 3:43:57.480]  to go but they're also a capitalist system but these two together are going independent on the
[3:43:57.480 --> 3:44:05.080]  currency game you see they're getting out of the dollar game and so is brazil and perhaps india
[3:44:05.080 --> 3:44:10.600]  and perhaps uh south african perhaps a whole lot of others and when they do all of a sudden there's
[3:44:10.600 --> 3:44:15.800]  going to be the pile of dollars floating around with no home to park in and you're seeing this
[3:44:15.800 --> 3:44:22.600]  in the same with euros um and rubles in terms of gas and oil exchange there's going to be a whole
[3:44:22.600 --> 3:44:30.680]  new configuration ladies and gentlemen us bankers are in deep trouble and so is the dollar in the
[3:44:30.680 --> 3:44:39.800]  long run because that's the decoupling of contracts globally our sovereignty is linked to a theory of
[3:44:39.800 --> 3:44:48.040]  wealth that is false it's a false narrative real wealth is converting money into those four things
