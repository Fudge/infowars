[00:00.000 --> 00:11.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.400 --> 00:18.960]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.960 --> 00:23.000]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:23.000 --> 00:37.240]  we have a absolutely jam-packed broadcast with just amazingly important
[00:37.240 --> 00:43.000]  developments lined up today as we track what's happening around the globe and
[00:43.000 --> 00:50.480]  here in the United States it is the 31st day of March 2011 and we're going to
[00:50.480 --> 00:57.800]  be live here for the next three hours at least and we're going to have open
[00:57.800 --> 01:04.100]  phones as well. Webster Griffin Tarpley one of our geopolitical analysts will be
[01:04.100 --> 01:09.360]  joining us as it becomes a mainstream media firestorm discussing the fact
[01:09.360 --> 01:16.360]  that the core of the rebels in the east of Libya that started this whole thing
[01:16.360 --> 01:23.440]  with Muammar Gaddafi are Al Qaeda and we have the key video posted at infowars.com
[01:23.440 --> 01:28.760]  and prisonplanet.com in a detailed article written by Aaron Dykes and my
[01:28.760 --> 01:34.080]  shelf breaking down the entire history of this and the headline is Al Qaeda is
[01:34.080 --> 01:42.440]  100% Pentagon run and then I have a comment a very well-written comment by
[01:42.440 --> 01:48.760]  rabbit 2000 who commented on the prisonplanet.com posting of Al Qaeda
[01:48.760 --> 01:55.080]  100% Pentagon where he takes a little issue with me and he's right and he's
[01:55.080 --> 02:00.280]  wrong and I'm right that Al Qaeda is a hundred percent Pentagon run but from a
[02:00.280 --> 02:04.880]  low-level perspective I'm wrong and I'm going to explain how this works how
[02:04.880 --> 02:08.760]  people are looking at this from a one-dimensional perspective and not
[02:08.760 --> 02:14.600]  understanding what true full-spectrum dominance is and Webster Griffin Tarpley
[02:14.600 --> 02:21.080]  is going to be discussing this with us as well obviously the big news first when
[02:21.080 --> 02:27.480]  we come back from break low levels of radiation found in US milk now remember
[02:27.480 --> 02:31.040]  they tell the troops that there's no health problems from DU even though
[02:31.040 --> 02:36.320]  their own internal army reports say it is a weapon that when fired from any
[02:36.320 --> 02:42.720]  device any large artillery small arms ignites in the barrel and that you get
[02:42.720 --> 02:48.800]  deadly doses of it every time you use it but they say now they may wave a magic
[02:48.800 --> 02:54.040]  wand 20 years ago in 1991 and said no it's now good for you I wonder how Anne
[02:54.040 --> 02:58.160]  Coulter and George Monbiot on the left and right are gonna feel now that Japan
[02:58.160 --> 03:03.440]  is saying they're bracing for deaths and that there is radiation sickness and that
[03:03.440 --> 03:07.520]  there's been an ongoing cover-up with that no kidding when you're getting a
[03:07.520 --> 03:12.720]  thousand milli sieverts of radiation an hour and that's conservative numbers if
[03:12.720 --> 03:18.920]  you get five hours of that it's a death sentence and that's the radiologist and
[03:18.920 --> 03:22.960]  radiation poison specialist that the Washington Post was interviewing three
[03:22.960 --> 03:27.680]  days ago so obviously if the radiation is so high that they've basically
[03:27.680 --> 03:33.400]  abandoned trying to fix the reactors and may go to dumping concrete on them
[03:33.400 --> 03:38.520]  to try to seal up the meltdowns what does that tell you if it's so deadly
[03:38.520 --> 03:42.760]  workers can't go in there I mean do you think that's a high radiation 100,000
[03:42.760 --> 03:49.480]  times normal levels as reported since Sunday four and a half days ago so low
[03:49.480 --> 03:53.920]  levels of radiation found in US milk Japan's nuclear rescuers inevitable
[03:53.920 --> 03:59.760]  some of them may die within weeks Fox News continuing president of Fukushima
[03:59.760 --> 04:03.040]  nuclear power plant operators sent to the hospital they're not really saying
[04:03.040 --> 04:08.320]  why I think I can guess he's been at the plant quite a bit radiation levels and
[04:08.320 --> 04:13.720]  seawater off Japan plants spiked to all-time highs CNN London Telegraph
[04:13.720 --> 04:20.200]  Japan nuclear crisis evacuees turned away from shelters because the the medical
[04:20.200 --> 04:24.960]  personnel are scared to treat them because they're so radioactive now I
[04:24.960 --> 04:30.400]  mean there's the people from the Fukushima region the prefecture are so
[04:30.400 --> 04:34.400]  radioactive that they're being turned away all over Japan I think there's some
[04:34.400 --> 04:39.960]  radiation going on oh it's in our mill but it's not a problem it's no big deal
[04:39.960 --> 04:44.960]  another headline Fukushima radiation double Chernobyl outside evacuation zone
[04:44.960 --> 04:49.360]  that's outside the evacuation zone Japanese are telling the kids go to
[04:49.360 --> 04:54.960]  school even in Fukushima even in the local area we're gonna come right back

[07:06.680 --> 07:10.920]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[07:10.920 --> 07:14.800]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[07:14.800 --> 07:19.320]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[07:19.320 --> 07:23.600]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[07:23.600 --> 07:27.760]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[07:27.760 --> 07:32.040]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[07:32.040 --> 07:35.760]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[07:35.760 --> 07:39.960]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[07:39.960 --> 07:43.360]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[07:59.880 --> 08:18.560]  ease the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:30.680 --> 08:39.480]  we are back live I barely slid into my chair here out there during the break
[08:39.480 --> 08:45.560]  working on things but we are live Phil what's so funny
[08:45.560 --> 08:53.880]  Phil is out there acting like he do what a close call you know we got all this
[08:53.880 --> 08:57.280]  incredibly serious news and I was out there during the break working on some
[08:57.280 --> 09:03.400]  other news reports that we're collating and I barely made it back in live here
[09:03.400 --> 09:10.480]  but we are now back in the saddle thank you so much for joining us today
[09:10.480 --> 09:16.320]  still laughing what did something else happen okay now just everybody's
[09:16.320 --> 09:20.680]  laughing like I'm you know 70 Sam or something we are live ladies and gentlemen
[09:20.680 --> 09:28.080]  it is the 31st day of March 2011 and we're gonna be live here for the next
[09:28.080 --> 09:33.840]  three hours Dr. Webster Tarpley will be joining us coming up dealing with the
[09:33.840 --> 09:37.680]  fact that it's become a firestorm in the media and it's being debated all over
[09:37.680 --> 09:42.680]  talk radio now mainline conservatives are finally going wait a minute and we're
[09:42.680 --> 09:47.000]  all a locky the head of Al Qaeda under bin Laden who runs all the major attacks
[09:47.000 --> 09:51.360]  is hanging out secretly at the Pentagon Fox News Associated Press you notice
[09:51.360 --> 09:54.280]  we've been beating this drum for months and now it's finally getting out there
[09:54.280 --> 09:59.560]  because everybody's heard me basically talk about this and others discussed it
[09:59.560 --> 10:04.000]  over the years and we've been made fun of even though we had the facts and now
[10:04.000 --> 10:07.240]  they're seeing all these mainstream news headlines about yes the core of the
[10:07.240 --> 10:12.840]  fighters are being basically armed by NATO and they are Al Qaeda and they are
[10:12.840 --> 10:19.880]  attacking Qaddafi and yes the airstrikes are killing civilians but this is
[10:19.880 --> 10:24.240]  liberty and people are going wait a minute Al Qaeda is now the good guys so
[10:24.240 --> 10:28.920]  coming up in the next hour with Webster Griffin Tarpley we're going to break all
[10:28.920 --> 10:36.320]  of this down today now in the meantime shifting into obviously the most
[10:36.320 --> 10:40.480]  important news we're gonna be going over the radiation now being picked up in
[10:40.480 --> 10:45.840]  milk here in the United States we're gonna get into Walmart CEO Bill Simon
[10:45.840 --> 10:51.040]  expects inflation inflation's already here my friends we're also going to get
[10:51.040 --> 10:56.960]  into farmers and seed producers launch preemptive strike against Monsanto we're
[10:56.960 --> 11:02.600]  also going to get into the fact that they're claiming that they are going to
[11:02.600 --> 11:09.800]  avert a government shutdown with Congress but why even worry about a
[11:09.800 --> 11:13.440]  government shutdown I mean why not just have the president run everything and be
[11:13.440 --> 11:17.760]  a dictator I mean he already ordered military strikes because the UN gave him
[11:17.760 --> 11:22.320]  an order and didn't even consult Congress and and and we already have the
[11:22.320 --> 11:26.800]  unelected SPP security prosperity partnership for North American
[11:26.800 --> 11:33.520]  integration in a you merger board setting most of our policies with Canada and
[11:33.520 --> 11:40.000]  Mexico and trade in the North American continent so why is it even an issue
[11:40.000 --> 11:47.920]  here to have the president just do whatever he wants see see that's the
[11:47.920 --> 11:52.680]  issue is that we're just being trained to accept a dictatorship of the
[11:52.680 --> 11:57.320]  presidential power and the bureaucracy and it's wrong so that's coming up
[11:57.320 --> 12:05.440]  today but we have seen in the last coming up on three weeks tomorrow we have
[12:05.440 --> 12:10.640]  seen since March 11th an ongoing cover-up by the Japanese government for
[12:10.640 --> 12:16.640]  two weeks the Japanese government would not release any radiation numbers from
[12:16.640 --> 12:22.200]  the two prefectures or the two states surrounding the Fukushima six reactor
[12:22.200 --> 12:28.440]  facility yesterday they were they reported another reactor seven miles
[12:28.440 --> 12:35.160]  away is now smoking and and and may be on fire most of the emergency personnel
[12:35.160 --> 12:39.600]  were pulled out more than two weeks ago the US military pulled back to 200 miles
[12:39.600 --> 12:47.280]  away two weeks ago last week the US military said they may begin forced
[12:47.280 --> 12:51.720]  evacuations of US personnel and citizens and we've gotten many calls on and off
[12:51.720 --> 12:56.800]  air saying that indeed the US military is going to addresses of US citizens and
[12:56.800 --> 13:01.200]  telling them to leave major corporations major media outlets from around the world
[13:01.200 --> 13:05.920]  France the US you name it have completely pulled out of Japan the
[13:05.920 --> 13:11.160]  government announced two days ago that it's a maximum alert the greatest
[13:11.160 --> 13:17.400]  alert since World War two that they have been under we know that at least five of
[13:17.400 --> 13:22.120]  the six reactors have either completely exploded two of the internal
[13:22.120 --> 13:27.480]  containment vessels have been breached at the number two reactor now going back
[13:27.480 --> 13:34.440]  two days ago or a day and a half ago plutonium and uranium has has has leached
[13:34.440 --> 13:39.560]  out through the broken vessel from the huge explosions and fires and has
[13:39.560 --> 13:44.560]  melted through the concrete floor and into the water table below that's why
[13:44.560 --> 13:51.840]  they're reporting 100,000 times a safe levels of uranium plutonium and all the
[13:51.840 --> 13:59.600]  other deadly isotopes of a cesium radioactive iodine it is incredible and
[13:59.600 --> 14:06.680]  our media is mainly focused on Libya mainly focused on NCAA mainly focused
[14:06.680 --> 14:13.720]  on issues of littler no significance and because this radiation is invisible
[14:13.720 --> 14:21.880]  it's it's being played down but we know a huge cover-up has taken place and we
[14:21.880 --> 14:28.200]  know as of a week ago radiation had already gone from Japan over the Pacific
[14:28.200 --> 14:32.680]  over North America over the Atlantic first reaching Iceland then England and
[14:32.680 --> 14:37.640]  now Western Europe going into Eastern Europe and will soon go all the way
[14:37.640 --> 14:42.560]  around the globe and pass over Japan again via the trade winds and jet stream
[14:42.560 --> 14:48.800]  it is in the jet stream thank God most of it is raining down in the Pacific
[14:48.800 --> 14:52.400]  before it gets caught up in the winds in the lower atmosphere and carried into
[14:52.400 --> 14:57.600]  the jet stream but it is circling the globe and if you put a radiation
[14:57.600 --> 15:02.600]  detector out you only get slight increases in North America and in Western
[15:02.600 --> 15:06.960]  Europe but that's because it's the general increased background radiation
[15:06.960 --> 15:12.720]  I mean here's an analogy to to to to boil it down if you're driving down the
[15:12.720 --> 15:19.520]  highway and you go whoo I smell a skunk well that's not one one thousandth of
[15:19.520 --> 15:22.840]  what it would be like to walk out in your backyard at night to throw some
[15:22.840 --> 15:27.920]  trash in the dumpster in the trash can and your dog runs out behind you and
[15:27.920 --> 15:34.240]  scares a skunk and the skunk sprays you and the dog that actually happened to me
[15:34.240 --> 15:40.500]  many years ago now let me tell you being sprayed directly by a skunk is is is
[15:40.500 --> 15:45.680]  obviously conservatively a thousand times more intense actually being sprayed
[15:45.680 --> 15:50.800]  by a skunk that's that you've startled then when a car has run one over an hour
[15:50.800 --> 15:54.800]  before and you just drive through and get a whiff of it and so basically that's
[15:54.800 --> 16:02.160]  what's happening is the detectors are just barely picking up the skunk stink
[16:02.160 --> 16:05.560]  you ever smelled a skunk from really far away and you're like that's a skunk
[16:05.560 --> 16:09.360]  they're almost kind of smells good a lot of finer French perfumes actually use
[16:09.360 --> 16:13.320]  a little bit of skunk musk in them to carry the scent to the olfactory nerve
[16:13.320 --> 16:18.680]  they attach other other smells to it that's one of the French perfume
[16:18.680 --> 16:25.440]  makers secrets so so so so we're just getting a whiff of peppy lapuse radioactive
[16:25.440 --> 16:32.560]  stench Japan is getting a full frontal 100,000 times safe levels spray of the
[16:32.560 --> 16:37.440]  skunk in the face but the problem is this skunk doesn't spray once for three
[16:37.440 --> 16:43.800]  weeks tomorrow it's exploding burning belching out the radioactive skunk stink
[16:43.800 --> 16:48.320]  and it's going out over the Pacific and most of it's going in the water then it
[16:48.320 --> 16:55.840]  gets into the krill it gets into the diatoms it gets into the plankton that is
[16:55.840 --> 16:59.720]  then eaten by the krill eaten by the shrimp eaten by the crabs eaten by the
[16:59.720 --> 17:06.120]  smaller fish the anchovies then eaten by the tuna then eaten by the humans and
[17:06.120 --> 17:12.400]  it bio accumulates all these different radioactive isotopes and toxins because
[17:12.400 --> 17:15.240]  even if some of these isotopes decay quickly they're still very poisonous
[17:15.240 --> 17:19.000]  even when they've already decayed and then you're going to be eating that
[17:19.000 --> 17:23.040]  fish and the media guaranteed is gonna tell you don't worry we're not even
[17:23.040 --> 17:27.400]  testing the fish remember what happened going back more than two weeks ago just a
[17:27.400 --> 17:31.320]  few days into this aircraft were coming in commercial aircraft into Dallas
[17:31.320 --> 17:36.280]  San Francisco Chicago and they were doing radiation testing now they're not
[17:36.280 --> 17:40.520]  even doing it and the Geiger counters would go off the chart on their shoes
[17:40.520 --> 17:45.000]  particularly and they just said go it's fine we're not going to have emergency
[17:45.000 --> 17:49.840]  scrubbers that every city has for homeland security NBC attack nuclear
[17:49.840 --> 17:53.480]  chemical biological we're not going to sorry to we're taking your clothes we're
[17:53.480 --> 17:56.880]  giving you you know something new to wear you got to go in this decon we're
[17:56.880 --> 18:00.680]  going to scrub you off you know with this soap you got to get as much of this
[18:00.680 --> 18:05.280]  off they're not sitting the shoes and clothes to a nuclear waste dump they're
[18:05.280 --> 18:10.480]  just come on in come on into America you know they'll they'll they'll
[18:10.480 --> 18:15.640]  confiscate your your pocket knife or they'll confiscate your bottled water or
[18:15.640 --> 18:19.000]  they'll confiscate your laptop and download the contents on to it without
[18:19.000 --> 18:22.440]  a warrant which the courts have ruled they can't do but they don't care they
[18:22.440 --> 18:25.720]  don't stop they're gonna stick their hands down your pants but when you get
[18:25.720 --> 18:29.520]  off an airplane and they had Geiger counters and they showed serious levels
[18:29.520 --> 18:33.720]  of radiation nothing's gonna happen and they're just gonna let that on out to
[18:33.720 --> 18:38.240]  the public because that's part of the policy of okay it's in the milk okay
[18:38.240 --> 18:42.000]  it's getting into the vegetables don't worry about it okay it's in the fish
[18:42.000 --> 18:46.080]  don't worry about it it's low level it's not bad for you just like they tell
[18:46.080 --> 18:50.760]  the troops with depleted uranium and they've got and culture on the fake
[18:50.760 --> 18:53.960]  right and they've got George Monbiot on the socialist left calling for world
[18:53.960 --> 18:58.440]  government saying hey we like radiation the people of Fukushima and cultures
[18:58.440 --> 19:03.120]  out there saying should be happy they're not gonna get cancer now really Fox
[19:03.120 --> 19:07.720]  News Japan's nuclear rescuers inevitable some of them may die within weeks
[19:07.720 --> 19:12.560]  one of the plant head when he broke down a week and a half ago say when he
[19:12.560 --> 19:16.440]  started crying he said no there there is super high levels of radiation this is
[19:16.440 --> 19:20.920]  gonna kill a bunch of people I can't lie to you oh guess where he is now the guy
[19:20.920 --> 19:24.480]  that broke down president of Fukushima nuclear power plant operator
[19:24.480 --> 19:28.400]  hospitalized he's been out the plant they're saying well we're not gonna
[19:28.400 --> 19:32.280]  really say why but it's high blood pressure and stress probably yeah sure
[19:32.280 --> 19:36.080]  and there's other reports here that the Japanese government's not releasing
[19:36.080 --> 19:39.600]  info just like they did with radiation detectors for a few weeks on exactly
[19:39.600 --> 19:45.760]  what's happening with people who have radiation sickness but
[19:47.240 --> 19:51.720]  medical facilities and shelters in the southern area of Japan are refusing the
[19:51.720 --> 19:56.440]  evacuees because of fears of radiation we'll just send them to America here we

[24:49.480 --> 24:55.960]  of Japan and the United States here's the San Francisco Chronicle low levels
[24:55.960 --> 25:01.000]  of radiation found in the US milk now remember in two weeks ago it's almost
[25:01.000 --> 25:05.560]  three weeks tomorrow but a weekend to the disaster the Japanese government was
[25:05.560 --> 25:08.720]  still saying very low levels of radiation nothing to worry about but not
[25:08.720 --> 25:16.360]  releasing radiation levels from the two states or prefectures around Fukushima
[25:16.360 --> 25:22.600]  when they finally released it it was 1600 times 10,000 times and now as of
[25:22.600 --> 25:29.280]  Sunday 100,000 times safe levels and we have seen clear evidence of cover-ups
[25:29.280 --> 25:34.240]  at the hospitals with reports of the citizens upwards of 50 kilometers away
[25:34.240 --> 25:40.320]  getting red-faced vomiting bleeding gums radiation poisoning now we're seeing
[25:40.320 --> 25:44.480]  the articles we're seeing the head of the plant break down a week ago and cry
[25:44.480 --> 25:48.600]  or more than a week ago and say that I can't be part of the cover-up people are
[25:48.600 --> 25:54.120]  going to die now in the news today Japan's nuclear rescuers inevitable some of
[25:54.120 --> 25:57.720]  them may die within weeks workers at the disaster-stricken Fukushima nuclear
[25:57.720 --> 26:01.760]  plant in Japan say they expect to die from radiation sickness as a result of
[26:01.760 --> 26:04.880]  their efforts to bring the reactors under control the mother of one of the men
[26:04.880 --> 26:08.760]  tells Fox News and that's the same calls we're getting that the vomiting the
[26:08.760 --> 26:13.720]  bleeding in the mouth it first hits your gums fast-growing cells ever burns
[26:13.720 --> 26:16.880]  your mouth eating pizza that's too hot and it like heels in a day but your
[26:16.880 --> 26:21.280]  regular skin wouldn't it's a fast-growing cells of the intestines and the mucus
[26:21.280 --> 26:25.840]  membranes in the sinus and in the mouth ladies and gentlemen and other areas
[26:25.840 --> 26:29.880]  other delicate areas of the body the so-called Fukushima 50 the team of brave
[26:29.880 --> 26:33.640]  plant workers struggling to prevent a meltdown before reactors critically
[26:33.640 --> 26:37.440]  damaged in the March 11th earthquake and tsunami are being repeatedly exposed
[26:37.440 --> 26:41.600]  to dangerously high radioactive levels as they attempt to bring vital cooling
[26:41.600 --> 26:45.440]  systems back online I'm going to say this again because this is what every
[26:45.440 --> 26:51.200]  nuclear physicist we've interviewed has said from Dr. Busby chemical physicist
[26:51.200 --> 26:54.880]  Dr. Bob Bowman three degrees in nuclear physics former head of the Star Wars
[26:54.880 --> 27:00.000]  program and many others that we've read in the mainstream press that yes
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.240]  background radiation in Europe and North America where this stuff blew over is
[27:04.240 --> 27:09.680]  only a little heightened but that's the general background radiation if one
[27:09.680 --> 27:14.320]  microgram of plutonium or uranium it's been splattered all over that area and
[27:14.320 --> 27:18.800]  ejected into the sky gets on a spider web the upper atmosphere they have
[27:18.800 --> 27:23.400]  plane test routinely they send planes up 30 50,000 feet and they they have
[27:23.400 --> 27:28.800]  scoops and they pick up spider webs pieces of dirt things that get into the
[27:28.800 --> 27:32.680]  atmosphere you see that stuff gets airborne like a kite and blows up
[27:32.680 --> 27:38.280]  the trash trash bags things little pieces of plastic that can then pieces of
[27:38.280 --> 27:43.560]  seaweed that dry and then get into the atmosphere that blows over and so the
[27:43.560 --> 27:46.800]  Geiger counter and we've seen this now with the different radiation monitoring
[27:46.800 --> 27:51.840]  stations they'll suddenly go from only a little bit of radiation to a lot as the
[27:51.840 --> 27:57.840]  piece of highly of highly radioactive material blows by and then it's like
[27:57.840 --> 28:01.080]  well we did get a spike we keep seeing these spikes and they go right back down
[28:01.080 --> 28:06.440]  that's because it's localized it's only little bitty pieces of this stuff that's
[28:06.440 --> 28:11.640]  actually making it over here and so that's why you're seeing certain
[28:11.640 --> 28:15.800]  detectors showing higher levels other showing no increases other showing just
[28:15.800 --> 28:26.840]  a general increase that's why this is happening now remember we have heard over
[28:26.840 --> 28:33.560]  and over and over and over again that it was only low radiation in Japan and it
[28:33.560 --> 28:37.760]  turns out that that was a cover-up the Russians in 86 with Chernobyl same
[28:37.760 --> 28:42.960]  story governments behave the same deceptive whitewashing manipulative
[28:42.960 --> 28:46.480]  because they'd rather not have liability for these big corporations that
[28:46.480 --> 28:50.080]  built these plants they'd rather not have politicians that have been pro
[28:50.080 --> 28:55.000]  nuclear getting in political trouble and there's really not a lot they can do
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.280]  about this so they're just going to tell you everything's fine very low levels
[28:59.280 --> 29:03.840]  of radiation turned up in a sample of milk from Washington State exactly where
[29:03.840 --> 29:06.600]  we predicted it would make landfall according to the meteorological reports
[29:06.600 --> 29:09.760]  the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration said
[29:09.760 --> 29:14.640]  yesterday but federal officials assured consumers not to worry well you know
[29:14.640 --> 29:19.240]  what we're only buying milk that's locally produced right now for our
[29:19.240 --> 29:25.520]  children even though Texas has gotten some of it in the winds in the satellite
[29:25.520 --> 29:30.600]  reports the FDA said such findings were to be expected in the coming days
[29:30.600 --> 29:34.000]  because of nuclear crisis in Japan and that levels were expected to drop
[29:34.000 --> 29:37.960]  relatively quickly really more radiations coming out we're just
[29:37.960 --> 29:44.160]  getting radiation now from a week and a half into the disaster it's admitted the
[29:44.160 --> 29:51.040]  higher levels came after that and are now belching forth as we speak we're on

[32:13.800 --> 32:18.360]  America and unprotected exports of food the falling dollars inflating food
[32:18.360 --> 32:24.240]  prices ethanol subsidies are driving fuel and food costs to all-time highs we
[32:24.240 --> 32:28.440]  are experiencing the greatest explosion of food shortages and food prices

[33:00.800 --> 33:11.960]  no one's got to take me
[33:20.240 --> 33:24.760]  okay so running back through these headlines
[33:24.760 --> 33:33.400]  Washington State is reporting radioactive iodine in the milk but the FDA
[33:33.400 --> 33:37.480]  saying don't worry about it it's not gonna hurt you this was to be expected
[33:37.480 --> 33:43.320]  and we expect the levels to drop my friends the facts are going back now
[33:43.320 --> 33:49.720]  it'll be three weeks ago tomorrow when the tsunami and earthquake first the
[33:49.720 --> 33:54.720]  earthquake in the tsunami hit and devastated the Fukushima six reactor
[33:54.720 --> 34:00.160]  facility and five of the six have either exploded have breached cores have
[34:00.160 --> 34:05.480]  fully melted down a reactor to was damaged and had a crack in it that has
[34:05.480 --> 34:10.960]  now melted and basically poured out and melted through the floor the London
[34:10.960 --> 34:16.960]  Guardian reported on that yesterday and there is almost no US media even talking
[34:16.960 --> 34:22.280]  about that and so the fires the explosions the smoking the meltdowns
[34:22.280 --> 34:28.960]  it's only intensifying they've gone from 20 times safe radiation to 100 to 200
[34:28.960 --> 34:37.160]  to 1600 to 10,000 to 100,000 as of four days ago on Sunday now does that jive with
[34:37.160 --> 34:42.400]  the FDA saying we expect the radiation to go down now no that's not what's gonna
[34:42.400 --> 34:46.360]  happen with the jet stream and the trade winds going right over Japan with those
[34:46.360 --> 34:53.080]  reactors on their east coast coming in in the highest levels from northern Mexico
[34:53.080 --> 34:57.960]  through southern California northern California Washington Washington State
[34:57.960 --> 35:02.480]  Canada and Alaska that's where it's heading that's where we said two weeks
[35:02.480 --> 35:06.080]  ago we expected to see the first radiation in the milk would be in
[35:06.080 --> 35:10.680]  Washington I said that on air why because meteorologists said the jet stream
[35:10.680 --> 35:15.560]  tended to dump in at a lower level on the west coast along that mountain range
[35:15.560 --> 35:20.800]  and then it would precipitate higher levels out from southern California and
[35:20.800 --> 35:24.840]  that mountain range the high desert all the way up through the mountain ranges
[35:24.840 --> 35:29.400]  and the and the hill ranges there on the coastline that's why you get so much
[35:29.400 --> 35:35.560]  fog in Los Angeles and so much smog is because you got those hills and mountains
[35:35.560 --> 35:41.560]  on the other side of the city the ocean currents and the ocean stream and the
[35:41.560 --> 35:45.760]  jet stream comes in and it builds up and stacks up against those mountains and it
[35:45.760 --> 35:48.480]  does it all the way up the coast and that's where you're gonna get higher
[35:48.480 --> 35:52.720]  levels of radiation but they're saying oh don't worry we expect it to lower it
[35:52.720 --> 35:58.000]  will not lower I mean if these plants continue to explode and burn and smoke
[35:58.000 --> 36:02.800]  and put out higher levels of radiation on average it takes seven to ten days for
[36:02.800 --> 36:06.200]  it depending on the speed of the jet stream you have to forecast that but
[36:06.200 --> 36:09.960]  seven to ten days according to all the meteorologists for whatever happens in
[36:09.960 --> 36:16.600]  northeast Japan to reach us so we could expect the next three to four days
[36:16.600 --> 36:22.680]  getting those higher levels of radiation here it will obviously dissipate into
[36:22.680 --> 36:27.480]  the Pacific Ocean so low levels of radiation found in US milk they're
[36:27.480 --> 36:31.520]  saying don't worry about it it's going to go down soon total lie I would
[36:31.520 --> 36:35.000]  absolutely expect I'd say it's a hundred percent because those those trade
[36:35.000 --> 36:38.800]  winds and jet stream haven't changed that it's going to go up in the next week to
[36:38.800 --> 36:43.840]  two weeks continuing Japan's nuclear rescuers inevitable some of them may die
[36:43.840 --> 36:48.280]  within weeks the head of the facility who's been at the facility is now in
[36:48.280 --> 36:51.960]  the hospital they won't really say why president Fukushima nuclear power plant
[36:51.960 --> 36:55.320]  operator hospitalized they give some vague thing about blood pressure
[36:55.320 --> 37:00.360]  radiation levels and seawater off Japan plants spiked all-time highs that's how
[37:00.360 --> 37:06.840]  to see an end continuing nuclear Japan nuclear crisis evacuees turned away from
[37:06.840 --> 37:10.560]  shelters hundreds of people evacuated from towns and villages close to the
[37:10.560 --> 37:14.040]  stricken Fukushima nuclear plant are being turned away by medical
[37:14.040 --> 37:20.160]  institutions and emergency shelters as fears of radioactive contagion catch on
[37:20.160 --> 37:25.480]  hospitals doctors nurses are refusing to treat people who when you put a
[37:25.480 --> 37:29.600]  Geiger counter to them the Geiger counter ticks up and I think that that
[37:29.600 --> 37:32.920]  violates their Hippocratic oath you signed up to be a doctor to be in rough
[37:32.920 --> 37:37.800]  situations but I can't really judge them because I haven't been in their shoes but
[37:37.800 --> 37:42.680]  I will tell you right now that this shows you that some of these people have
[37:42.680 --> 37:48.360]  been around radiation 100,000 times safe levels and they are walking dead many of
[37:48.360 --> 37:53.200]  them they are also walking dead that do spread the contagion of high radiation
[37:53.200 --> 37:57.880]  so we're going to break that down more coming up in the next hour Fukushima
[37:57.880 --> 38:02.440]  radiation double Chernobyl outside evacuation zone and Kurt Nemo has a
[38:02.440 --> 38:06.880]  detailed report linking to the New York Times and Japanese reports the
[38:06.880 --> 38:09.920]  radiation level in the ocean near Fukushima near the plant keeps rising
[38:09.920 --> 38:16.120]  it is now 4,385 times up from 3,000 plus times what it was yesterday was
[38:16.120 --> 38:21.160]  3,000 and change yesterday now it's 4,385 times what is considered normal
[38:21.160 --> 38:26.320]  this is a significant increase from the yesterday report of the radioactive
[38:26.320 --> 38:32.320]  iodine 131 isotope down in water that was 3,355 times the regulatory
[38:32.320 --> 38:36.120]  limit Japan officialdom does not consider this a problem they explained
[38:36.120 --> 38:39.960]  that the isotope loses half its radiation every eight days and should
[38:39.960 --> 38:44.040]  dilute over time trace amounts of radioactive seizing M137 have been
[38:44.040 --> 38:51.960]  found in anchovies as far away as Chaiiba near Tokyo and it continues with
[38:51.960 --> 38:58.000]  that information we will be breaking that down Japanese are now protesting all
[38:58.000 --> 39:01.840]  over the country some even ramming the gates of the Tokyo power electric
[39:01.840 --> 39:09.000]  company with a car they are saying that they want answers they're holding up
[39:09.000 --> 39:12.920]  signs that say we need the truth so the Japanese are starting to get angry it
[39:12.920 --> 39:16.680]  takes a lot to get them mad at their government France urges worldwide nuclear
[39:16.680 --> 39:21.120]  review after Japan crisis that's so they can control the whitewash Japan has
[39:21.120 --> 39:25.400]  even more nuclear reactors than France has more nuclear reactors than even
[39:25.400 --> 39:32.400]  Japan so that's all coming up now I want to shift gears into al-Qaeda what is it
[39:32.400 --> 39:36.800]  what's its history who created it we have a video along with a detailed
[39:36.800 --> 39:41.280]  article at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com that it's vital to get
[39:41.280 --> 39:47.200]  out to everyone you know the headline is al-Qaeda 100% Pentagon run now that
[39:47.200 --> 39:52.520]  doesn't mean the low-level grunts know this they actually have a false enemy
[39:52.520 --> 39:56.840]  built for them that they fight our grunts don't understand this al-Qaeda
[39:56.840 --> 40:01.440]  grunts don't understand this but at the top they are being financed by the
[40:01.440 --> 40:06.080]  globalist to bring down the liberties of the west but also as a pretext to
[40:06.080 --> 40:11.160]  invade the Middle East and Central Asia now I'm gonna break this down then we're
[40:11.160 --> 40:15.120]  gonna get Webster Tarpleon to go over it more because it's finally really
[40:15.120 --> 40:18.840]  starting to catch fire more and more mainline conservatives are saying whoa
[40:18.840 --> 40:24.960]  Alex Jones is right the head of al-Qaeda is dining at the Pentagon they are
[40:24.960 --> 40:29.400]  being funded the West was already in there months ago setting up this
[40:29.400 --> 40:32.320]  rebellion against Qaddafi we're gonna go ahead and go to this nine and a half
[40:32.320 --> 40:39.680]  minute report titled al-Qaeda 100% Pentagon run here it is
[40:39.680 --> 40:50.920]  the system thinks you're stupid they think you're morons and I'm about to
[40:50.920 --> 40:54.360]  cover one of the biggest examples of this in modern history one of the
[40:54.360 --> 41:00.080]  biggest hoaxes I've ever seen anyone who's followed the news for the last
[41:00.080 --> 41:06.480]  few decades anyone who's researched admitted mainline history knows that
[41:06.480 --> 41:12.040]  al-Qaeda was CIA created with the backing and support of the Saudi
[41:12.040 --> 41:16.640]  Arabians and the Israelis as well as Pakistani intelligence Zbigniew
[41:16.640 --> 41:20.840]  Brzezinski's written two books bragging that in 79 they created the group had
[41:20.840 --> 41:24.960]  them attacked the Russians to get them to then invade Afghanistan so that the
[41:24.960 --> 41:29.520]  Soviets could have their quote Vietnam this is a fact and the Muslim brigades
[41:29.520 --> 41:33.000]  being controlled by British intelligence goes back to Lawrence of Arabia and
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.800]  then Hitler took over the Middle East during the first few years of World War
[41:35.800 --> 41:41.720]  two and they went over to his control but the hoax is that in the attack
[41:41.720 --> 41:46.520]  against the Serbs to take over Serbia it was admitted al-Qaeda and Osama bin
[41:46.520 --> 41:52.880]  Laden running those operations and then NATO came in and bombed all of Serbia
[41:52.880 --> 41:56.880]  and they were forced to give up one third of their land basically to Albanian
[41:56.880 --> 42:01.560]  backed Muslim rebels who were calling themselves al-Qaeda then of course we
[42:01.560 --> 42:06.200]  have the attacks of 9-11 and the Newsweek headlines about hijackers
[42:06.200 --> 42:11.440]  trained at US bases and the Dean of the Defense Language School coming out and
[42:11.440 --> 42:15.800]  saying that they were trained at US bases and then you have the Times of
[42:15.800 --> 42:19.920]  London as well reporting on the airlift of evil months after the Afghanistan
[42:19.920 --> 42:24.240]  war started US military and British military captured thousands of top
[42:24.240 --> 42:28.960]  al-Qaeda and Taliban commanders and they would be ordered to release them and
[42:28.960 --> 42:35.800]  fly them out into Pakistan to start the next wave of destabilization so al-Qaeda
[42:35.800 --> 42:44.200]  on record is a CIA slash British slash Israeli slash Saudi Arabian creation and
[42:44.200 --> 42:50.600]  they're used all over the world and then you add to that Fox News AP last
[42:50.600 --> 42:55.360]  October 2010 reporting and we're all a lucky the guy they're now saying is more
[42:55.360 --> 43:00.880]  powerful than a summit bin Laden trained in the US ran the underwear bombing the
[43:00.880 --> 43:06.520]  Christmas Day event ran the Fort Hood shooting ran the Times Square attack the
[43:06.520 --> 43:11.800]  list goes on and on the shoe bomber he's always handling these patsies and it
[43:11.800 --> 43:15.280]  turns out he's secretly hanging out at the Pentagon when he's been on the most
[43:15.280 --> 43:19.120]  wanted list and getting orders and having dinner with the Secretary of the
[43:19.120 --> 43:23.680]  Army and top brass while he's on the news as the head of al-Qaeda Julie Kurtz
[43:23.680 --> 43:28.400]  transits from Washington you've got to be kidding me yeah here's what we know
[43:28.400 --> 43:33.320]  Fox News has learned that Anwar al-Alaqi the American Muslim cleric remember him
[43:33.320 --> 43:38.360]  with a worldwide following dined with military brass at the Pentagon within
[43:38.360 --> 43:45.920]  months of a 9-11 attacks now you add to this hoax now that the openly Western
[43:45.920 --> 43:50.400]  funded rebels in the east of Libby and I'm not saying he's a good guy the point
[43:50.400 --> 43:57.000]  is the West overthrew Egypt and its own puppet to the east of Libya they've
[43:57.000 --> 44:02.560]  brought down Tunisia now it's admitted that British special forces were inside
[44:02.560 --> 44:10.080]  eastern Libya even before the latest rebellion started so al-Qaeda rebels and
[44:10.080 --> 44:14.480]  it's admitted that the head of the Libyan rebels was trained by the CIA for
[44:14.480 --> 44:19.280]  decades in Virginia and he admits that he's working with al-Qaeda al-Qaeda and
[44:19.280 --> 44:24.440]  so I have to get up here and either say no to this hoax and expose the facts or
[44:24.440 --> 44:29.600]  say I'm a bad American because I refuse to say that now al-Qaeda are freedom
[44:29.600 --> 44:35.560]  fighters and great people I must refuse to be ignorant and not face the facts of
[44:35.560 --> 44:40.440]  history but the average gullible person out there who buys into the system will
[44:40.440 --> 44:44.720]  make the decision to say oh I guess al-Qaeda is good it's like 1984 we've
[44:44.720 --> 44:48.280]  never been at war with East Asia and the next day we've always been at war with
[44:48.280 --> 44:52.360]  East Asia and if you pointed out that well you said we were at war with them
[44:52.360 --> 44:57.800]  yesterday but we're not at war today and that we were never at war then you get
[44:57.800 --> 45:02.880]  arrested in that system and that's basically where this country and where
[45:02.880 --> 45:08.960]  the West is going where the system thinks we're so stupid that Western
[45:08.960 --> 45:14.680]  intelligence is in the east of Libya usling radical Muslim al-Qaeda backed
[45:14.680 --> 45:19.840]  out of Saudi Arabia and arms out of Saudi Arabia and Egypt to destabilize
[45:19.840 --> 45:24.080]  Qaddafi Qaddafi then fights armed force trying to overthrow the government and
[45:24.080 --> 45:29.400]  our media calls them protesters protesters who had tanks and missile
[45:29.400 --> 45:34.280]  launchers and Western weapons oh the poor protesters and the media lied and
[45:34.280 --> 45:37.480]  said he strafe protesters turned out that wasn't true the media lied and said
[45:37.480 --> 45:40.760]  that he'd he'd run to Venezuela to try to give the rebels support think they
[45:40.760 --> 45:44.040]  would win it doesn't mean that there aren't groups in Libya who don't like
[45:44.040 --> 45:51.440]  the goofy dictator Muammar Qaddafi but Muammar Qaddafi is independent and has
[45:51.440 --> 45:56.080]  tried to build a strong Africa outside of the New World Order and that's why he
[45:56.080 --> 45:59.840]  must be brought down he doesn't have a international private central bank
[45:59.840 --> 46:03.560]  running his country they have their own central bank and that's why the system
[46:03.560 --> 46:08.000]  is doing this and they think we have no memory where they're telling us al-Qaeda
[46:08.000 --> 46:11.000]  is horrible we've got to take all your liberties in America because they may
[46:11.000 --> 46:15.240]  attack you any minute the end of the bill of rights freedom is dead America
[46:15.240 --> 46:19.400]  surrenders and gives up all its rights to Homeland Security to keep us safe
[46:19.400 --> 46:25.360]  because of al-Qaeda but then al-Qaeda who wants to overthrow the secular Arab
[46:25.360 --> 46:30.560]  leader Qaddafi is being brought in to do this and then we're being told it's
[46:30.560 --> 46:35.080]  humanitarian and we've got to bomb them and attack them to protect them I mean
[46:35.080 --> 46:39.800]  think about it folks and we're all a lucky the number one guy under a mid-laden
[46:39.800 --> 46:43.160]  secretly hanging out the Pentagon the Taliban al-Qaeda being flown out to
[46:43.160 --> 46:47.840]  safety in the first few months the Afghan war to start the next crisis al-Qaeda
[46:47.840 --> 46:51.480]  being used to attack the Serbs when the Serbs fight back oh it's humanitarian
[46:51.480 --> 46:55.800]  we've got to bomb them they just move al-Qaeda around all over the world call
[46:55.800 --> 47:00.040]  them humanitarian freedom fighters if anybody resist them and then the UN and
[47:00.040 --> 47:05.680]  NATO comes in and bombs the daylights out of them but at least with the attack in
[47:05.680 --> 47:09.440]  the 90s against Serbia they wouldn't got congressional authorization for
[47:09.440 --> 47:13.200]  force at least bush with his illegal wars because there's they were still
[47:13.200 --> 47:17.560]  wars of aggression but he went and got the Congress to sign off on it wasn't
[47:17.560 --> 47:23.200]  engaged in that form of brazen treason Obama less than 48 hours after the UN
[47:23.200 --> 47:30.360]  gave that resolution to invade openly in front of everyone he ordered the US
[47:30.360 --> 47:36.680]  military to start bombing and firing cruise missiles when out in the open the
[47:36.680 --> 47:41.840]  UN had given the order and Obama hadn't even consulted Congress this is a huge
[47:41.840 --> 47:45.800]  issue that's taking place here my friends and I hope you'll research the
[47:45.800 --> 47:49.800]  fact that al-Qaeda is an arm of the globalist al-Qaeda is an arm of the new
[47:49.800 --> 47:54.760]  world order al-Qaeda is a system that the new world order uses to minnish
[47:54.760 --> 47:58.440]  civilizations into giving up their liberties in the name of protection and
[47:58.440 --> 48:03.400]  also to go stir up revolutions and wars to then poses freedom fighters so the
[48:03.400 --> 48:07.680]  globalist have an excuse to come in and take over countries this is 21st century
[48:07.680 --> 48:14.560]  imperialism and al-Qaeda is the key set piece on this game of chess to bring us
[48:14.560 --> 48:19.120]  into the world government they are a creation of the private banking cartels
[48:19.120 --> 48:23.600]  who are waging wars against the nation-state and all basic liberties that
[48:23.600 --> 48:28.360]  defend the rights of the indigenous populations of the nation-states al-Qaeda
[48:28.360 --> 48:35.200]  is CIA is a MI6 is Mossad is Saudi Arabian intelligence and they've caught
[48:35.200 --> 48:41.040]  British SAS dressed up like al-Qaeda shooting at police in Basra to get
[48:41.040 --> 48:45.520]  Sunnis and Shiites killing each other I mean al-Qaeda is the Swiss army knife of
[48:45.520 --> 48:50.320]  destabilization they are that magic go-to tool that's used to foment the
[48:50.320 --> 48:54.880]  crisis so the globalists have the excuse to offer the solution we've broken down
[48:54.880 --> 49:00.120]  one of the biggest modern ongoing hoaxes in history where you're un-american if
[49:00.120 --> 49:04.400]  you don't support the freedom fighters of al-Qaeda well I don't support them and
[49:04.400 --> 49:07.200]  I don't agree with what Ronald Reagan said about them saying that they were
[49:07.200 --> 49:11.800]  founding father material I don't like al-Qaeda now you may hate me because I
[49:11.800 --> 49:17.160]  don't love al-Qaeda I'm not gonna apologize I'm sorry I hate al-Qaeda and I
[49:17.160 --> 49:20.400]  hate their handlers even more
[49:20.400 --> 49:25.840]  ask yourselves what are you doing in this time of great challenge what are you
[49:25.840 --> 49:37.960]  doing to unlock my all right folks we are back live thank you so much for
[49:37.960 --> 49:43.840]  joining us and that was powerful audio for radio listeners but when you watch
[49:43.840 --> 49:48.760]  the nine and a half minute video every statement I make is congressional
[49:48.760 --> 49:54.040]  reports mainstream news articles admissions Brzezinski's own book
[49:54.040 --> 49:59.040]  Aaron Dykes did an off-the-chart job again he did a lot of the research I did
[49:59.040 --> 50:02.680]  a lot of it we print up the articles before I do the breakdown then he has
[50:02.680 --> 50:06.240]  them all to put in the video when somebody watches that and this video is
[50:06.240 --> 50:11.160]  freaking people out it's free on YouTube get it out to everybody you know we
[50:11.160 --> 50:15.400]  put a lot of hours in I'd say collectively 20 hours in the last two
[50:15.400 --> 50:19.840]  days into putting together that nine-minute video to really break it
[50:19.840 --> 50:24.360]  down but still we've only broken down one facet and later after we've had
[50:24.360 --> 50:30.760]  tarpley on for 30 minutes when he leaves us I'm going to explain that it's real
[50:30.760 --> 50:34.280]  but it's not real you see the low-level al-Qaeda operatives are criminal
[50:34.280 --> 50:37.640]  psychopaths jihadists who believe they're fighting the West the Great
[50:37.640 --> 50:42.320]  Satan in their mind but their but the but their master controllers actually
[50:42.320 --> 50:45.920]  were funded and created by the globalist and are protected and hang out the
[50:45.920 --> 50:51.600]  Pentagon so see the al-Qaeda really is killing our troops but that's because the
[50:51.600 --> 50:54.880]  Empire has to have an enemy to fight that's full-spectrum dominance they
[50:54.880 --> 51:01.360]  create the entire military universe the enemy and the responder we all know
[51:01.360 --> 51:04.720]  that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water
[51:04.720 --> 51:08.440]  filtration as an authorized Berkey dealer for over five years and serving

[52:08.200 --> 52:12.440]  history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from
[52:12.440 --> 52:16.400]  underneath the Americans at home. I've turned a tremendous influence on our
[52:16.400 --> 52:20.640]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's
[52:20.640 --> 52:25.880]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. For the
[52:25.880 --> 52:30.440]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[52:30.440 --> 52:34.800]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[52:34.800 --> 52:38.520]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, the arsonists they're asking for more
[52:38.520 --> 52:42.480]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to. Today seems
[52:42.480 --> 52:48.040]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[52:48.040 --> 52:54.080]  the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or
[52:54.080 --> 53:00.600]  watch it online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. Hi this is
[53:00.600 --> 53:04.120]  Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[53:04.120 --> 53:07.840]  seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a
[53:07.840 --> 53:11.280]  real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or
[53:11.280 --> 53:14.680]  gold. It's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this
[53:14.680 --> 53:18.440]  country and it's possible that could even happen again. So our friends at
[53:18.440 --> 53:22.880]  Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they
[53:22.880 --> 53:27.920]  call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[53:27.920 --> 53:31.640]  dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have
[53:31.640 --> 53:35.480]  not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to
[53:35.480 --> 53:40.480]  plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com
[53:40.480 --> 53:47.080]  that's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365
[53:47.080 --> 53:55.360]  that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the
[53:55.360 --> 54:01.200]  ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[54:01.200 --> 54:16.440]  All right we're gonna continue with the globalist secret
[54:16.440 --> 54:22.000]  stratagem of controlling both sides of a conflict and how they throughout
[54:22.000 --> 54:26.840]  history have carried off this masterful feat really in the last 200 to 250 years
[54:26.840 --> 54:30.520]  in Europe is where the system was developed by the banking cartels to
[54:30.520 --> 54:34.600]  finance both sides this is just a more sophisticated form of that so the grunts
[54:34.600 --> 54:39.480]  in the US military or the NATO military they don't know that Al Qaeda is being
[54:39.480 --> 54:44.200]  financed and protected by the globalist on record and the low-level Al Qaeda the
[54:44.200 --> 54:50.080]  young poor men that they recruit out of Palestine they recruit out of Libya
[54:50.080 --> 54:56.240]  Saudi Arabia Pakistan Afghanistan they're not aware of it as well and many of
[54:56.240 --> 55:00.640]  the young men they capture they then take the torture centers and recruit them
[55:00.640 --> 55:03.760]  to then be the leaders of Al Qaeda and I've been telling you that for years it's
[55:03.760 --> 55:08.880]  come out in the news the main rebel leader was captured and put years ago in
[55:08.880 --> 55:13.840]  one of these torture brainwashing centers and now openly works for the CIA
[55:13.840 --> 55:17.560]  that's all over the news and we have links to that in the big article that
[55:17.560 --> 55:22.960]  we wrote that accompanies the video of the same name Al Qaeda 100% Pentagon run
[55:22.960 --> 55:29.120]  from the top and that's that's why the head of Al Qaeda the number two guy and
[55:29.120 --> 55:33.200]  they will immediately now says he's number one operationally Amaral Alaki is
[55:33.200 --> 55:37.080]  secretly hanging out the Pentagon with the Secretary of the Army I mean this is
[55:37.080 --> 55:41.120]  reality ladies and gentlemen and it's so over the top they know the average
[55:41.120 --> 55:44.360]  person can't deal with it kind of like when they blew up building seven in
[55:44.360 --> 55:47.440]  front of everybody and had police say get back they're blowing it up the news
[55:47.440 --> 55:50.800]  said they're blowing it up to protect other buildings nobody asked how do you
[55:50.800 --> 55:56.080]  wire building so precisely during an emergency in a few hours when it takes
[55:56.080 --> 56:00.040]  regular firms weeks or months then they blew it up and said oh it fell on its
[56:00.040 --> 56:04.440]  own but we said but you just said you blew it up again this is all in your
[56:04.440 --> 56:09.120]  face they think you're too afraid to face the facts this is mind control this
[56:09.120 --> 56:12.480]  is psychological warfare but it's not even our government doing this it's
[56:12.480 --> 56:16.680]  rogue synthetic terror elements and of course Tarpley has written the book that

[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:31.520]  happening at Fukushima low levels of radiation found in US milk San Francisco
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:36.440]  Chronicle Associated Press Wall Street Journal also reporting on it Japan
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:41.360]  nuclear rescuers inevitable some of them may die the head of the plant is in the
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:46.920]  hospital Fukushima 50 death unavoidable the Japanese government is saying it's
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:50.880]  gonna be a lot more than the Fukushima 50 unfortunately radiation levels and
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:57.080]  seawater off Japan have now gone up to over 4,000 times safe levels Japan
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.320]  nuclear crisis even hospitals are refusing people from in and around
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:04.520]  Fukushima because of the higher levels of radiation on their bodies and
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:08.480]  clothing of course when these people flying to the US radiation detectors go
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:13.560]  off homeland security says come on in in Japan the doctors are like I'm not gonna
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:17.320]  treat you you're so radioactive here when they get out of the country and come
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:23.200]  here it's like come on in they're also lying big time the food and drug
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:26.800]  administration saying well there is some radiation in the milk but that's the
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:30.000]  first it precipitates out in the large cows and then precipitates out in their
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.680]  udders and their mammary glands they're now running around saying well that was
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:37.120]  radiation from a few weeks ago that got here we think it's gonna go down now
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.600]  well the radiation that blew over here from a few weeks ago that's now gotten
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:44.280]  here and then gotten into the food chain that's from the early leaks and the
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:48.800]  explosions now there's full meltdown and the least reactor number two it's
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:52.240]  melted out from a crack in the containment facility threw into the
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:57.560]  ground it's smoking up into the air it could go completely Chernobyl mainstream
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:02.440]  news was reporting levels of radiation at least double Chernobyl so what do you
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:06.640]  think's really going on here it's incredible and I just mentioned earlier
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:10.240]  that we I was looking for potassium iodine for my family because stuff I
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:14.960]  had was over 10 years old and and and you weren't supposed to you know if we
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:19.520]  needed to take it we couldn't and we found the third biggest manufacturer of
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:24.720]  the pills they have the raw potassium iodine 200 doses for an adult that's
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:30.400]  that's a 20 adults for 10 days and we held back some until everything was
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:34.200]  shipped out to make sure that we had enough we've got limited vials of
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:38.400]  potassium iodine in the original form that basically lasts forever and the
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:42.480]  pills it degrades this I've been told basically lasts forever kind of like
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.840]  honey lasts forever they've gotten honey out of Egyptian tombs you can still eat
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:49.280]  and we have a limited supply because they're out of them now we bought a
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:56.880]  limited supply of these rad stickers that pick up the radiation levels and we're
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.320]  basically buying these for like three dollars a piece and selling them for
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:03.160]  five dollars now because they're sold out ladies and gentlemen so again we have
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:06.900]  a limited supply of these rad stickers and this all started because I was
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:11.800]  looking for this for myself and found right under our nose in Texas the only
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:17.360]  place that had these they are the exclusive distributor of the the third
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.720]  largest brand of the pills the only distributor of the raw potassium iodine
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:25.120]  out there and the only us distributor directly from the factory of the rad
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:29.000]  stickers and we got a limited supply of those I expected to be gone in hours if
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.040]  it's anything like a few weeks ago and so this is yet because the rad stickers
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:38.640]  are sold out everywhere well from the supplier of the potassium iodine is
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:46.040]  sold out info wars dot com or 8882533139 we're limiting these to five per
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:50.440]  person because the supplies are so limited we wanted to get out to everybody
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:56.480]  so again 8882533139 or info wars dot com we're right back with Dr. Webster

[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:29.040]  silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:34.280]  needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas this
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:40.440]  includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:44.400]  the digestive system be sure to watch our new seven-minute video tour of the
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:50.520]  silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:55.320]  silver lung system works as well we are always ready to answer any questions you
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:07:01.720]  may have that's www.silverlungs.com this is Alex Jones with five good
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:05.720]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:09.520]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:13.880]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:18.240]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:22.680]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:27.440]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:31.240]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:34.840]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:39.200]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:42.360]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:46.040]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:16.880]  because there's a war on for your mind
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:23.520]  Aaron Dykes and I have spent the last two days in deep research codifying all
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:27.560]  of our previous research and the latest developments putting it into a detailed
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:36.800]  report al-Qaeda 100% Pentagon run at info wars.com prison planet.com now that
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:44.920]  doesn't mean that there aren't real jihadi al-Qaeda psychopaths criminals
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:55.520]  dupes miscreants misfits misguided loons that are attacking but al-Qaeda
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:01.360]  according to Brzezinski who founded them in 79 under the Taliban it is the name
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:05.160]  of a CIA database of jihadi fighters from all over the Middle East and
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:10.160]  Central Asia who then are funded and financed through spy handlers like
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:15.000]  Amaral Laki who was brought up in the US Pentagon train secretly hanging out at
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.600]  the Pentagon Associated Press Fox News Reuters it's all there so I wanted
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:24.040]  Webster Griffin Tarpoli who's been doing a stunning job and is the true
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:28.040]  omnibudsman of understanding this to go through their history and we'll take a
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:31.840]  whole hour if we have to to go through their whole history who they are what
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:36.720]  they are but yes when they suicide bomb someone it's real those guys believe
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:40.280]  in what they're doing when they go into a CIA base in Pakistan and blow up a
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.880]  bunch of people it's real and you notice that guy last year that blew up a bunch
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:48.480]  of CIA people in Pakistan he'd been one of their double agents many of them are
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:53.200]  trained they're they're picked up in different areas of the world they're
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:57.160]  taken to torture centers then they're recruited and put out as commanders that
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:02.440]  the Reuters and others and BBC it's just all over the news now are reporting
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:05.880]  one of the main rebel leaders admits there's a thousand al-Qaeda fighters
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:10.280]  under him and that he was picked up years ago and taken to a US black site
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:14.920]  go site and then released many of these leaders it turns out were picked up then
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:20.200]  released and then go out as double agents to lead the SWAT guy it came out in
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:27.600]  the telegraph and BBC in 2006 a year after the 7-7 bombings that he was the
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:32.160]  guy who ran the attacks but then he was allowed to fly in and out of England to
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:36.600]  Africa and back and when the lower level Scotland yard wanted to arrest him
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:42.960]  MI6 said no he's ours the underwear bomber brought on board the plane by the
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:46.240]  sharp-dressed man didn't have to have a passport didn't have to have anything he
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:50.000]  got a visa from the US when the visa office got in trouble the assistant
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.880]  secretary of state mr. Kennedy said look I was ordered by an unnamed US
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:58.280]  intelligence agency to give him a visa and help him get on the plane just as
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:02.320]  Kurt Haskell the lawyer and his wife who witnessed all this had said on this
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:08.920]  show first okay and we're all lucky the CIA lackey handling the Fort Hood
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:14.800]  shooter handling the shoe bomber on record the government says it's him and
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:18.880]  they won't release to Congress the hundreds of emails from him and the
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:23.720]  psychiatrist to sign of Fort Hood infamy it's just like the FBI even mainstream
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:27.520]  news in the last year has admitted you know that the FBI figures type it into a
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:32.280]  search engine FBI creating terror FBI creating groups and it's not even
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:37.880]  Muslims or Arabs it's generally guys with with with with Anglo last names or
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:42.920]  Hispanic or African Americans who get recruited into Islam in prison and they
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:49.000]  don't go join some al-Qaeda group the FBI comes as al-Qaeda sets them up gives
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.360]  them dummy bombs to create this perception of terror so what the CIA and
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:57.360]  high-level Pentagon is doing is one level more sophisticated because I saw a
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:01.880]  comment that we're going to Webster but I want to preface this I saw a comment on
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:06.560]  the prison planet dot-com version of the posting of al-Qaeda 100% Pentagon run by
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:12.080]  rabbit 2000 and he said Alex we're getting it in the pants from al-Qaeda and
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.520]  there's these other military guys saying we know we're not allowed to catch
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:17.760]  him or capture him and there's some truth to this but why would the Pentagon
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:22.320]  want to have its own people killed don't they want to win the Pentagon wins
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:26.560]  because it works for the offshore banks by funding the commanders of al-Qaeda and
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:30.600]  other groups to attack as a pretext to go in and get the 500 billion a year in
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:34.960]  opium out of Afghanistan that went from 10% of world production of opium before
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:40.360]  the takeover in 2001 to over 93% now you could type that in you know 90 plus
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:43.840]  percent of opium now coming out of Afghanistan to the weapon sales the
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:46.640]  pretext to destabilize Pakistan about the former head of Pakistani
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:52.040]  intelligence on to break that down when 8000 Taliban and al-Qaeda cream times of
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:57.360]  London Newsweek airlift of evil were captured 2001 2002 they would be ordered
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:02.480]  to release them pay them money gold the international currency and fly them out
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:07.000]  on C-130 to Pakistan okay and the media tried to spin it like it was Pakistan but
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.920]  it was our own military doing it this is how they're operating this this is how
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:16.120]  the globalists get their wars their businesses war remember about 15 years
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:20.920]  ago there was a famous case of a guy in Manhattan who ran and advertised and ran
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:25.240]  the biggest windshield repair shop and he had a team of four guys who went out
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:30.120]  every night with ball peen hammers and busted people's windshields and then
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:33.320]  guess who had billboards and signs up gets your windshield fixed for the lowest
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:37.440]  price it's very simple the globalist bankers want to take our liberties they
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:41.440]  ministers with al-Qaeda they went over for al-Qadhafi they put an al-Qaeda they
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:44.800]  want to overthrow the Serbs say it's humanitarian when the Serbs fight back
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:48.040]  they bring in al-Qaeda they want to get the Russians to start a war with them
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:52.760]  bring in al-Qaeda 1979 the media tells you that you know we got involved in 82
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:57.000]  so Webster Tarpley is going to break this down for you from the history right
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.800]  through what's happening today to understand what's going on here Webster
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:08.920]  you of course have authored the seminal book that again when I read it five
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:12.200]  years ago yeah five years ago when it came out I'd already separately the
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.920]  reason I could confirm it was all so accurate took me to another level though
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:20.280]  and taught me something was separately I'd seen all this in government
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:24.440]  documents that are public mainstream news all there but never put together in
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:30.520]  one place like 911 synthetic terror made in the USA and the former head of
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:34.800]  German intelligence Andres von Mulo and former minister of research and
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:43.720]  technology said 911 synthetic terror is brilliantly and most sovereignly written
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:48.680]  one can't stop reading Webster delivers a devastating judgment congratulations I
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:54.880]  endorse it wholeheartedly and it just goes on and on and on and on and on with
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:15:00.280]  the people that endorse this book and so I certainly hope you get it at info
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:05.680]  wars.com but regardless it is a treatise it is written very scholarly but if you
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:09.640]  read this you'll understand everything okay and we tried to boil it down in the
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:13.640]  nine-and-a-half minute video with documents the entire time al Qaeda a
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:17.400]  hundred percent Pentagon run and that's an oversimplification but but the point
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:21.760]  is it's it's globalist rogue network run through the rogue networks in Israeli
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:26.520]  Mossad in British MI six in US intelligence in Saudi intelligence so
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:30.040]  Webster you've got the floor for the rest of this segment the next and I've got
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:33.160]  questions then I want to go into what's currently happening and the larger
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:37.480]  strategy here but do you concur with the analysis I just laid out oh yes by all
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:41.240]  means there's just one one thing to point out though because people find it
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:46.720]  confusing there has been a change there's been a shift and it's this al Qaeda is
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:53.040]  exactly what you say under Bush Cheney and the neocons al Qaeda was a reason to
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:16:00.920]  bomb and invade countries with the idea that for example if you have Zarkawi
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:06.320]  Zarkawi was a guy who was in an enclave of Iraq that was not controlled by Saddam
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:11.520]  Hussein it was defended it was the so-called Ansar group the US air cover
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:16.800]  the no fly zone protected him and at a certain point in 2004 I believe it was
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:21.680]  when the credibility of bin Laden was getting shot up by various British
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:27.080]  documentaries and others Zarkawi comes out and says I am the supporter of
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:32.960]  bin Laden and al Qaeda and I pledge eternal loyalty and this was a godsend
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:37.960]  for US propaganda because it allowed the US to say aha you see Bush was right
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:43.440]  all along al Qaeda is in Iraq and of course what those people did then inside
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:48.120]  Iraq was that they went went out and killed a great number of Shiites to get
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:52.200]  a civil war going to split the population so there would not be a united
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:58.000]  front against the against the US forces so Bush Cheney would say if al Qaeda is
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:03.960]  there we can bomb them we can invade them now in the case of Obama with the
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:09.000]  new Brzezinski strategy which is different with Obama you see al Qaeda
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:15.000]  becomes your infantry it becomes the the US ground forces the idea I guess it
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.720]  goes back to its inception under Brzezinski and you predicted three years
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:22.000]  ago this would be the change in strategy it's gone back to what it was at the
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.320]  beginning when Brzezinski and Robert Gates the current boss of the Pentagon
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:30.960]  when Robert Gates was deputy director of the CIA as he more or less tells us in
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:35.960]  his memoirs he said we could we considered creating a CIA Arab legion to
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:39.040]  go fight the Soviets in Afghanistan but then we decided not to well
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:44.800]  unfortunately he decided to do it or he and and others so today the idea is the
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:49.040]  United States is so so poor so overstretched right we're suffering from
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:55.520]  imperial overstretch we can't have an invading force or we they they into
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:00.240]  these characters would rather not have an invading force so they say we'll
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:05.240]  provide air cover and the ground forces the ground troops our divisions in
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:11.320]  effect our infantry will be this al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb meaning the
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:17.960]  Libyan Islamic fighting group which is a is an older terrorist organization which
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:22.480]  was then sheep dipped into al Qaeda they declared themselves part of al Qaeda I
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:29.400]  believe in 2007 it was announced by a man's al wahiri the the reputed mi6
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:34.280]  double agent who essentially runs the show there with this bin Laden who may
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:38.280]  or may not be there this group of actors whatever it is so so that's the
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:41.920]  difference it used to be that al Qaeda was something that you would bomb and
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:47.320]  strafe and invade and try to kill and use to create a civil war but in this
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:51.280]  case it's it's slightly different because now the air support comes in on the
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:55.520]  side of al Qaeda and with that though you've got a tremendous a tremendous
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:00.400]  contradiction because in Obama's speech the other night Obama said well I want
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:03.960]  to salute the American military because they're going after al Qaeda all
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:09.880]  across the globe well no not in Libya where you're arming them and financing
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:14.280]  them and providing air support and not in Yemen because the group that's trying
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:18.000]  to overthrow the government of Yemen are basically people who have been
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.040]  recycled through the Guantanamo Bay concentration camp they've been sent in
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:29.200]  there in particular the head of it is a guy called shiri shi hri is a Saudi who
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:34.920]  is in Guantanamo Bay camp there and they sent him back to create al Qaeda in the
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:40.520]  Arabian Peninsula a QAP and as you mentioned our dear friend al laki the
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:45.240]  CIA laki has been transferred over there and al laki the CIA laki is you know so
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:50.280]  they've got the Muslim brigade commander now in place after doing great
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:53.320]  jobs here in America for them especially at Fort Hood I'm sure he's gotten
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:56.000]  medals with those dinners with the secretary of the army we'll be right
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.600]  back on the other side of this break to continue to break down this key

[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:17.560]  Amarillo Locky who's run the attacks to help give us the naked body scanners
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:22.200]  who's helped attack the troops on record runs all the attacks so they can
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:26.440]  bring in their tyranny they've now deployed one of their top ringwraiths
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:32.320]  to the area Adam Gadan the grandson the former head of ADL who was arrested for
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:36.760]  beating up Arabs in Southern California before he grew a big beard and makes
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:41.760]  these announcements always concurring with a new invasion he's running around
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:47.720]  so you were getting into Amarillo Locky the CIA commander well these are double
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:52.280]  agents I think both the two that you've just mentioned Adam the American so-called
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:56.800]  and and our lucky the CIA lucky these these are double agents and these are
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:01.720]  the leadership people you were talking about Al Qaeda before as the database
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:05.680]  right and certainly from the Pentagon point of view and again it's it's not
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:09.640]  the whole Pentagon it's the people inside the Pentagon who are part of that
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:14.680]  Wall Street target network that rogue network that invisible government that's
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:20.400]  been there since Grober Cleveland surrendered to JPMorgan back in 1895 it's
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:23.720]  not the average the average military officer is going to be a victim of this
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:27.120]  stuff and not that those are the people that you were mentioning before so from
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:30.880]  the from the point of view though of the let's say the CIA terrorist controller
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:35.680]  that are yet or special forces guys or something like this it's a database but
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:40.760]  in terms of the social process that you see sociologically it's a pool it's a
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:46.080]  it's a middle-earer right it's it's where people go and can be found it's in
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:49.680]  cafes or on the internet and who are these people that you were mentioning
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:54.560]  before they're fanatics they're psychotics they're dupes they're misfits
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:58.120]  they're mercenaries some of them do it for money some of them are part of a
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:01.280]  criminal enterprise they're they're common criminals some of them are
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:06.920]  mental deficient those are quite common in their chaos league right in the
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:10.720]  middle of all this other double agents and the double agents are the ones who
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:14.200]  tend then to become the leadership figures because they have the outside
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:18.560]  support and they the outside support can can shape the environment so that these
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:23.680]  double agents get get more power so the average person the average rank-and-file
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:29.360]  member of al-qaeda maybe a fanatic or a dupe or or a misfit or a psychotic he
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:33.560]  may not know that he's actually working for the US he thinks he's working for
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:40.640]  some some religious call the ongoing Pentagon bombings in in North Africa in
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:47.240]  Yemen in Pakistan Iraq Afghanistan killing whole weddings that's also a good
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:51.840]  way to create quote al-qaeda i.e. anybody that resist when they go to join al-qaeda
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:56.480]  they come into double agent midst to then be directed against the west as a
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:00.600]  pretext for the defense spending and the new wars but now the shift back to the
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:08.080]  1980s model of also using them as a secret army brigade right so so this is
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:11.680]  the situation we now have I mean the news from the last few days you've
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:15.760]  probably gone through it on Saturday we have the London Daily Telegraph repeating
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:20.120]  an article from the U.S.O.A. the 24th order the main Italian business
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:23.800]  newspaper this is actually quite remarkable it was all day of Milan
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:28.840]  sort of like the Wall Street Journal sends a reporter to Donna and Donna is
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:33.600]  the city about halfway between Benghazi and Tobruk the rebel heartland where
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:38.640]  these anti-giddafi people are very strong it had number one recruiting zone
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:42.880]  of al-qaeda worldwide the world capital of terrorism per capita in other words
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:49.000]  50 or 60,000 people and about one fighter one jihadi one Mujahideen
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:54.280]  Mujahideen sent to Iraq or Afghanistan per thousand
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:59.640]  population beating in absolute numbers sending more terrorists than Riyadh
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:04.200]  which is Saudi Arabia four to five million people this little town of 50
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:10.840]  60,000 sends more people over there 85% of them are suicide bombers and it
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:17.000]  turns out now that the commander of the town Hasidi is this former US POW he's
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.680]  a former possible Guantanamo Bay inmate because nobody knows he says he was not
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:26.160]  in Guantanamo he says he was held in the secret prison in in Pakistan but it
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:30.280]  the Libyan government says he was held in Guantanamo and that could indeed be
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:34.640]  accurate and the Italian reporter goes to meet this guy and takes his picture
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:41.480]  and the guy says I sent 25 fighters to go kill the US and NATO in in Afghanistan
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:46.160]  and Iraq and this is now the person they want to give them modern weapons they
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:50.520]  want to give them a cut of the 32 billion dollars in frozen assets they
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:55.000]  want to give them future oil revenue this is absolute insanity and indeed
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.520]  governments around the world I think that there's some there are some cables
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:01.880]  going into the State Department governments around the world I think
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:06.080]  are going to ask the United States we demand explanations what in God's name
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:11.360]  do you think you're doing funding this group of wild crazy destructive
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:16.840]  sociopathic terrorists and giving them a big chunk of the the southern coast of
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:20.480]  the Mediterranean this area of of Surinaca the other thing that
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:25.520]  supplements al-Qaeda in this case is the presence of the tribes because this is
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:30.840]  a tribal society now there was a monarchy there and the tribes that
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:36.560]  benefited from the monarchy with the Harabi and the obey that stay there
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:41.560]  break down the the regional situation let's look into a wider view of why the
[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:45.800]  globalists are doing this and how we stop it we'll also break a look at the

[01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:58.080]  absolutely right that we've been right I wanted to read and it's somewhat
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:04.400]  lengthy and then I wanted Webster to respond to this a commenter who was on
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:10.120]  prisonplanet.com in the article titled al-qaeda 100% Pentagon run or should say
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:14.640]  birthed you know commanded created that's where it started out the Pentagon
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:21.200]  engaged was there back in 7980 now this is a rabbit 2000 says sadly with
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:26.680]  headlines like this and the headline again was al-qaeda 100% Pentagon run
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:30.920]  sadly with headlines like this AJ will never advance any further with his media
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:34.520]  efforts or following than he has right now really we're just exponentially
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:38.520]  exploding being hardcore not menacing words pal the worst thing is there's a
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:42.840]  lot of truth to this but to make a blanket statement like this is a
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:48.000]  official company policy at Lainley is insane while the real secret policy is
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:51.640]  not the public policy or not what low-level compartmentalized people are
[01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:57.960]  given Bob it isn't like the CIA has been bloodless in all of this folks they
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:01.640]  publicly now ship the the opium out and put it on Fox News and say it's good
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:05.560]  they've got to ship the opium out or al-qaeda will get it the al-qaeda fighters
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:10.320]  CIA is supposedly running as agents and managed to do some real heavy damage in
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:14.360]  blood to CIA officers and at least a couple of very high-profile operations
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:19.480]  in Afghanistan against them you mean when one of the brainwashed fighters sees
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:25.000]  through it and then attacks there's been a few cases of that again this is so
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  incredible if you go back to strategy 2000 plus years ago with Alexander the
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.320]  Great he would send in a small force to draw out the main force of the enemy
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:42.760]  into an area that geographically supported Alexander's main forces I mean
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:48.040]  it's called a gambit you sacrifice upon it's in chess that the Persians invented
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:52.720]  3000 years ago or more they can debate some say northern Indians developed it
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:57.480]  same area the point is is that you sacrifice the pawn to make your enemy
[01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:02.800]  come out in a phalanx that you are going to basically pincers attack ever played
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:07.280]  chess ladies and gentlemen you got to think 10 15 20 moves ahead that's what's
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:10.520]  going on here and see those of you in the military going well I know we're not
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:12.800]  allowed to catch him and they're protected and they are always hanging out
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:16.440]  at US military bases and when we do catch him we got to release him I and
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:20.680]  ensure they're telling us al-Qaeda's good now you know in these over throws or in
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:25.080]  these rebel actions but but but the Pentagon's fighting them I mean the
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:28.800]  Pentagon wants to win no they don't want to win they are winning by being able
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:32.640]  to be in these regions and control these oil and opium resources and use it as a
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:36.840]  reason to take our liberties this poor guy you know he's nice but he's not
[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:40.760]  getting it it isn't like the CIA has been bloodless in all of this the al-Qaeda
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:44.600]  fighters and CIA supposedly running as agents have managed to do some real heavy
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:50.440]  damage well yeah Alexander the Great might send in 300 horsemen and then to
[01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:53.960]  draw out his enemy and knowing they're all going to get wiped out that that's
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:58.400]  warfare of course there's going to be real killing of course they have been
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:02.840]  caught in my six having their guys dressed up as she as soon he shoot it
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:06.560]  shooting sea ice to get that stirred up as a pretext to stay in Iraq and to
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:10.520]  destabilize both sides and divide and conquer of course troops are going to
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:14.320]  get killed they're staging and triggering the wars they've got patsy's
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:17.760]  working under them so the CIA's controlled fighters are fighting their own
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:22.360]  controllers and murdering agents in cheap ambushes is that it well if that's
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:27.000]  the case the CIA is far greater disarray than I've been led to believe disarray
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:32.160]  global domination pal additionally it makes no sense the Pentagon would as an
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:36.880]  institution no it's the leadership follow anything like this well the whole
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:41.240]  Pentagon didn't lie about WMD's a special office of special plans was set up to
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:44.840]  lie and then quote fix the intelligence as the White House and Downing Street
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:49.640]  memo show wasn't the whole Pentagon not the secretary not some army captain in
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:54.120]  logistics additionally makes no sense the Pentagon would as an institution
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:57.840]  follow anything like this policy they are taking it right in the shorts are far
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:00.800]  worse than any of the other organizations on earth from these jihadi
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:04.520]  fighters you mean how they let the troops use DU that's a slow death you
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:07.640]  mean how they signed secret deals to steal their death benefits Bloomberg
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:10.280]  reported you mean oh they don't want to hurt the troops they could care less
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:14.840]  Kissinger called them dumb animals now we're supposed to accept that the
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:19.160]  Pentagon as a whole is actually running their own worst and most lethal enemy
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:23.920]  well that's they are running them it's public come on it's laughable but this
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:29.520]  doesn't mean it passes the laughing test and then he goes on Webster responding
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:34.240]  to rabbit 2000 can you explain full-spectrum dominance how the criminal
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:38.120]  cartels have to create the enemy through their controllers and their ground
[01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:41.640]  troops don't know and our ground troops don't know that this is part of the
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:46.680]  pretext to control both sides well I would just direct his attention to what's
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:52.040]  happening in Libya first of all you you cannot pitch what your analysis is to
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:56.160]  US public opinion because you have some public opinion is manipulated it's
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:40:00.680]  practically brainwashed and it's often wrong so this doesn't matter you
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:06.960]  got to look at the evidence now we just had Admiral Stavridis the NATO commander
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:11.800]  the US Admiral who is the NATO commander of all the NATO armed forces and he
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:16.000]  testified at the Senate Armed Services Committee and said we see flickers of
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:22.720]  al-Qaeda flickers Admiral go and look in the POW prisoner of war records of your
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:28.280]  own commands and you will find it has city the commander of the rebels in the
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:33.600]  city of Dana one of the top half dozen cities of this rebellion was at one time
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:38.800]  your prisoner of war he was a terrorist captured near Peshawar in Pakistan or if
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:42.320]  you can't do that why don't you pick up the London Daily Telegraph or get
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:46.320]  somebody to give you a version of this you sold a article which is the the
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:51.200]  original one hell hockey is at the Pentagon getting orders maybe they met
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:57.280]  for lunch Hillary says we have no 100% insight into this well in that case you
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:01.200]  better back off then shouldn't you it seems to me that this is going to be
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:05.640]  a huge issue now and it's it's good that you're out in front on it I see this
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:11.920]  issue of the US supporting al-Qaeda in Libya out of this awful opportunism right
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:15.720]  because that's what it is it's a it's the idea that you can somehow control the
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:20.160]  outcome what they've forgotten is the Frankenstein monster principle you
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:26.560]  create these covert operations you think you can control them and sometimes you
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:30.920]  can't I mean if you look at the story of Lenin or to some degree the story of
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:36.040]  Hitler these are each in its own way covert operations that escaped from
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:40.360]  control and turned against the people that had that had fermented them at the
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:44.440]  beginning but now I see inside the United States this has been on all the
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:50.480]  cable networks how did he is going with it MSNBC as having to respond to it and
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:54.920]  the Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov has made a I think an important turn
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:59.560]  towards a sharper criticism of what's going on there after having been in a
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:04.440]  kind of a spent sitting a position for a while it seems to me this is going to
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:08.760]  become a big issue how do you go into northern Pakistan and kill people with
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:13.120]  predator drones and attack wedding parties with the idea that you're
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:18.520]  attacking al-Qaeda when you're also embracing arming financing and and
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:24.800]  indeed defending with propaganda al-Qaeda in Libya how do you how do you go to
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:28.920]  other places around the world and accuse people of being al-Qaeda as as
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:33.400]  Obama said we're going after al-Qaeda everywhere not not in Libya not in
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:37.920]  Yemen and the mother of al-Qaeda the little bit of the history of it the
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:42.320]  mother organization is this Muslim brotherhood back in the 1920s the
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:47.760]  British saw in Egypt that there were strong anti-colonial anti-imperialist
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:53.040]  anti-pronational nationalist tendencies in the waft party which was the the main
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:58.480]  political party in Egypt so they created a brand of very benighted Muslim
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:01.840]  fundamentalism which essentially was the rejection of modernity it was
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:07.200]  extremism it was a radical rejection of modern technology modern institutions
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:11.040]  and the modern world and that's the Muslim brotherhood and that comes from
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:16.040]  the 1920s which is what the globalists want so that these these highly advanced
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:20.800]  societies that invented mathematics and in writing they can never get on their
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:24.960]  feet and be independent this is a war against civilization exactly these are
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:30.000]  obscurantist their anti-science their anti-intellectual all this today the
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:34.240]  Muslim brotherhood exists as a British kind of freemasonry it's a British
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:39.320]  masonry which appeals to doctors lawyers professors but in those poor
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:43.800]  societies doctors lawyers professors often have a very oligarchical
[01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:48.000]  mentality right they think that there's some kind of elite or petitions rather
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:51.600]  different from what we have here where these people are not so not so different
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:56.520]  they're like a milk nobility okay yeah something like that they have you know
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:44:01.680]  pretenses right they they they believe they should rule well out of that like
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:06.640]  you spin off out of that the second or third generation of that then can become
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:10.200]  people who are interested in in in violence notice that the al-qaeda
[01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:15.160]  ideology is perfect it's made to order the al-qaeda ideology says all existing
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:20.240]  Arab states all existing Muslim states are illegitimate they shouldn't be there
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:24.280]  because they're not the caliphate so therefore whatever it is if it's Libya
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:29.240]  Algeria Egypt Jordan doesn't matter they're not the caliphate therefore they
[01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:34.240]  have to go down so that's a perfect way to have an international movement and
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:38.400]  these are indeed international deployments as we see from this hasid he
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:45.240]  goes from Lebanon to Syria and then to Iraq or to Afghanistan it's a perfect
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:50.440]  way to get a armed movement going against the existing government now in
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:54.680]  Egypt it was the golden youth in the square right the upper middle class
[01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:58.240]  kids who were interested in Facebook and Twitter that were the main forces
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:01.520]  same thing in Iran two and a half years ago exactly and of course there it
[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:06.280]  didn't work but then when you when they needed more numbers they would bring in
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:10.000]  the Muslim Brotherhood for the big demonstrations but then as we see in
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:15.120]  Libya if the regime fights back and uses military force against military
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:18.840]  force because they're those guys in Egypt those demonstrators they were violent
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:22.240]  from the beginning they were lynching policemen they were burning down the
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:26.080]  party headquarters killing people with arson and God knows what it's the same
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:29.520]  thing in Libya and we don't like Kedavya the point is he's not with you know the
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:33.440]  globalist pick so he's better than them they were attacking they had armored
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:36.760]  vehicles they were attacking government buildings and our media called them
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:40.800]  protesters right and it's a very important thing to see these two tribes that I
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:45.480]  mentioned the tribes that are the basis of this Libyan Islamic fighting group
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:50.720]  Anabell Qaeda the Harabi and the Obedad they're racists there's a there's a
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:56.000]  tribe a tribal group in the southwest corner of Libya called the Fezzan and
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:00.440]  they are either black or very dark and at the beginning of the rebellion you
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:04.960]  heard this propaganda line that everybody who was black in Libya was a
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:09.520]  mercenary brought in by Gaddafi to fight against these wonderful rebels so that
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:15.080]  meant that if you were from Chad or Mali or Somalia or Eritrea you were going to
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:20.400]  be lynched and they lynched a lot of people they massacred stories 50-60
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:25.080]  people in a factory run by a Turk they were from Chad the rebels came in killed
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:29.000]  them all you never heard a word about that these are people who are racist and
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:33.600]  this it extends to the to the black and dark tribes of southwest Libya again the
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:39.280]  so-called Fezzan if that rebel army ever got into western Libya the Harabi
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:44.160]  and the Obedad would start killing the Gaddafi that's Gaddafi's tribe the
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:51.820]  the Magrahi or the another important tribe the Wafala and the Fezzan so
[01:46:51.820 --> 01:46:55.240]  they would be genocide so the UN resolution says we're protecting
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:58.880]  civilians and it would actually turned out to be genocide interesting story the
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:03.320]  woman on the weekend who claimed she was raped Obedi well you look at her name
[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:07.480]  she's Obedi what does that mean it means she is from the Obedad tribe and the
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:12.920]  Obedad tribe is an elite group inside the Harabi the Obedad so therefore we
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:17.520]  have to ask ourselves what is the story of this woman who comes forward claiming
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:22.560]  she was raped and she is from the Obedi is she not perhaps a Jessica Lynch is
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:27.520]  she not another Kuwait incubator babies is she not another Neta another by the
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:30.960]  way our media is saying these rebels are like George Washington under the most
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:35.320]  loving people but it's admitted buried in all the news that they're just
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:39.240]  grabbing people they don't know or people they had scores with lining them up
[01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:43.240]  and shooting them absolutely and the media is like and then Egypt last week
[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:47.520]  banned all protests the media is like that's freedom yes yes tyranny is good
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:50.920]  and Al Qaeda is good and we're like no tyranny is bad Al Qaeda is bad and
[01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:54.160]  they're like shut up you're an American yeah these are not the singing
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:59.520]  tomorrows of democracy human rights and the rule of law this is brutal cynical
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:05.520]  imperialist colonialist power politics politics and the again the rebels in
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:12.320]  Libya are simply the ground forces of imperialism of NATO and in the middle
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:16.440]  of them a lot of them are you know young young people from the Harabi tribe in
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:21.160]  the Obedad tribe who hate Gaddafi but in the middle of it is Al Qaeda now the
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:25.280]  reason that the Harabi in the Obedad hate the other group when there was the
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:31.560]  monarchy this area of Sirenayika right when the Italians were there there was
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:35.840]  something called the Sunni order and the Sunni order are obscure in this they're
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:39.720]  kind of like the Muslim brotherhood and they were fighting the Italians and
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:43.160]  they've got into cahoots with the British of course obviously so that
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:47.120]  after the fall of Mussolini after World War two when the British took over the
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:53.440]  area the British installed King Idris who was from this Harabi Obedad and Sunni
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:59.240]  order and they were the ruling class and the British still think they own
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:02.880]  Iran that they had the same story they still think that Libby is theirs and
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:06.120]  that's why we saw the British Foreign Ministry a month ago say that Gaddafi
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:09.720]  had fled to Venezuela and that he was strafing crowds all of that turned out
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:15.360]  to not be true but it's fun to be conned again right so the the idea is that the
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:21.960]  the tribes of this Benghazi Donna Tobruk area are monarchists they're not
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:26.160]  interested in democracy they have the flag they use is the monarchist flag and
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:30.240]  there are pretenders to the throne there are descendants of King Idris who want
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:33.200]  to go back and be king and that's what I'm sure we're almost out of time great
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:37.720]  job tarply.net in the minute we've got left how do you see this unfolding not
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:41.120]  how you want to see it right now the way the cards are being played it looks
[01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:44.120]  like this thing is not going too well Gaddafi's been repulsing the latest
[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:47.280]  attacks right now they've got troops off the coast they're saying we may invade
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:51.440]  but it's not a ground war it'll be humanitarian backup right well we know
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:54.960]  that there have been special forces from the US the British and the French have
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:58.120]  been there for more than a month delivered by a ship some of the Dutch
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:02.840]  ones were captured some of the British ones were captured Obama we now have
[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:07.560]  this this order from Obama saying that the CIA and the special forces can go
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:14.360]  in it it's rather late in the day I think it's going to be likely that you're
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:19.000]  going to see some kind of an invasion by NATO with the US in the lead that will
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:23.920]  violate the UN resolution which forbids boots on the ground because the UN
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:28.360]  resolution also forbids bringing in weapons the US has been smuggling in
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:32.440]  weapons with the help of the Egyptian junta for probably a month or more
[01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:36.400]  also that's why they had to bring down Egypt first because Mubarak wasn't going
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:40.760]  along with this as you said a month ago right and remember Gaddafi last October
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:44.600]  Gaddafi kicked out the Western oil companies and brought in the Chinese
[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:49.040]  the Russians and let the Italians stay well we're out of time and positive
[01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:52.240]  points we're out of time will have you up very soon thank you for the time we

[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:20.400]  this radio broadcast is all about empowering people with knowledge in two
[01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:25.520]  months ago I had dr. Joel Wallach on for an hour we had a lot of requests to have
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:31.200]  him back on if he's a syndicated radio host of course dead doctors don't lie
[01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:37.880]  for what 15 16 years he's been out there he of course is a veterinarian and he
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:42.080]  also holds a well I'll discover his bio here he's published numerous books on
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:45.920]  dietary deficiencies is being one of the main causes of all these increased
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:50.680]  illnesses and their results and effects dr. Wallach conducts approximately
[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:55.000]  300 lectures annually to overflowing enthusiastic audiences all over the
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:00.440]  world he sold over 40 million cassettes CDs before the internet even got big
[01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:03.760]  which recordings on the lecture dead doctors don't lie he obtained a
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:07.680]  bachelor's of science and agriculture from the University of Missouri in 62
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:12.800]  with a major in animal husbandry and nutrition and minor in field crops and
[01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:16.120]  soils that's why he learned about the soils being depleted which is now
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:20.120]  admitted in 64 he was awarded the doctorate in veterinarian medicine also
[01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:23.480]  from the University of Missouri thereafter he completed a three-year post
[01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:26.440]  doctoral fellowship at the Center for Biology and Nutritional Systems at
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:30.040]  Washington University in St. Louis Missouri in 82 he obtained a doctorate
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:33.080]  in naturopathic medicine from the National College of naturopathic
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:36.680]  medicine in Portland, Oregon and of course the site where we promote his
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:42.560]  incredible information is info wars team dot com info wars team dot com will be
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:46.200]  with us till about 45 after next hour them in a blitz through financial news
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:50.640]  nato news the latest on the meltdown reactor full meltdown will it explode
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:55.720]  like Chernobyl is the question at Fukushima number two but dr. Doug
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:55:59.320]  Wallach I got a lot of questions for you I mean not just looking at the dietary
[01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:03.920]  deficiencies because they say you need 40 plus minerals but the products you've
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:07.400]  developed that we carry at info wars team dot com like the beyond tangy
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:11.000]  tangerine they have over 90 minerals and I remember separately reading mainline
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  studies years ago that that if you don't have these other trace minerals and
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:19.640]  things your body then can't fully access the 40 or so that they say is all that
[01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:24.400]  you need that's those trace minerals trace elements and I want to go over some
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:28.360]  of the things that we know because here's the deal I've seen the real
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:33.800]  statistics overall life expectancy's gone down until the 20s and 30s are
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:38.480]  so around a third in the west of children died by the age of five so
[01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:43.000]  infant mortality did get better but if you average out infant mortality people
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:47.840]  are living over 84 years on average now men they just downgraded to what 73
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:53.360]  years women 75 to 76 years it varies every year so people say oh there's not
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:58.320]  poison in the food and water the soils aren't you know debilitated because
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:01.520]  people are living longer well that's not really true if you go to an old
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:06.760]  cemetery in many cases more than a third our children our babies so yes those
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:12.080]  developments in regular medicine has gotten better so that those numbers are
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:17.360]  averaged out but you are averaged in but you take them out life expectancy is
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:20.640]  going down and I want to talk about why that's happening because from your
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:24.440]  research which I work for large animal and a small animal vet they were
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:30.920]  obsessed when I'm top of his class A&M they were obsessed with minerals and
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:34.400]  it was always minerals minerals minerals for your cows horses pigs ducks
[01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:37.840]  everything minerals minerals minerals you know being how to have them
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:40.880]  healthier live longer all the studies about cows they don't have the right
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:44.120]  minerals freezing to death easier when they shouldn't I mean you know all this
[01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:47.600]  explain this to people but but do you concur with my analysis on life
[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:55.160]  expectancy well Alex you hit the nail right on the head in 1990 America ranked
[01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:59.040]  to 17th in the world longevity at that time we're actually spending more money
[01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:04.320]  for health care than all the other 200 plus nations on earth and today we ranked
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:08.080]  50th and we're still spending more money for health care than all the other
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:13.920]  200 plus nations on earth and kind of a fun one is a medical doctors back in
[01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:17.920]  1993 when I came out with the original audio cassette tape dead doctors don't
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:22.320]  lie lived being average of 58 today medical doctors live to be 56 I'm

[02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:22.160]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:27.120]  alright Dr. Joel Wallach is with us for the next 45 minutes or so getting into
[02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:30.440]  one of the biggest causes from his research a lot of other research
[02:00:30.440 --> 02:00:35.200]  confirming it being mineral deficiencies vitamin deficiencies and the fact
[02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:39.720]  that our overall life expectancy is dropping it's also dropped massively in
[02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:44.320]  Russia and if you average out the fact that infant mortality at least the last
[02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:49.200]  80 years or so has gotten better then you realize it's it's when you average
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:52.240]  that out that we are living a lot less you were going over some of those
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:56.600]  numbers Dr. Wallach please continue well thank you Alex so well you know as we
[02:00:56.600 --> 02:00:59.880]  said the average medical doctor today Lizzie 56 there's supposed to be the
[02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:03.760]  holders of all knowledge when it comes to health billionaires who can afford to
[02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:07.840]  eat the best can afford to hire the entire staff of Harvard Medical School
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:14.080]  for a little owie on their finger a cold in 2004 Forbes magazine did a study on
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:18.680]  them for longevity and what kills them and they found out that billionaires die
[02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:22.680]  from heart attacks cancer diabetes and stroke all things everybody else dies
[02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:26.520]  from and they there's never been a billionaire living to be a hundred and
[02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:32.760]  back then in 2004 the average lifespan of billionaires was 78 with just this
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:39.000]  last month March I think maybe we're still in March here the Forbes magazine
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:42.560]  did another study on billionaires and they had dropped from 78 and average
[02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:48.840]  lifespan now to 66 so in a seven-year period they've dropped from 78 to 66
[02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:52.040]  is a 12-year drop and there's still never been a billionaire living to be a
[02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:57.040]  hundred and this is because they leave out the most important piece which you
[02:01:57.040 --> 02:02:01.560]  pointed out very clearly Alex that they're they're leaving out the basic
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:07.280]  raw materials that the human being needs to maintain itself you cannot fix a
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:12.320]  nutritional deficiency with pharmaceuticals and surgery and you're
[02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:16.480]  exactly right so many diseases we have today are actually physician-caused
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:20.840]  disease and I really appreciate the opportunity to bring this up that right
[02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:24.560]  now everybody's yelling about all Americans being deficient in vitamin D3
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:28.440]  well who caused that the medical doctors who said stay out of the sun use
[02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:33.080]  these SPF 7 billions long sleeves gloves big brim hats don't go out in the moon
[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:37.360]  lit night do not take vitamin A and D because they'll kill your liver so it's
[02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:41.280]  no wonder every American is deficient vitamin D3 now they charge you $300 to
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:45.560]  test your levels and then they give you prescription vitamin D3 for 150 bucks a
[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:49.920]  month you get free vitamin D3 standing out in the sun for 20 minutes then they
[02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:56.200]  also cause another series of diseases now one of which of course is alchemy
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:03:00.120]  disease probably the most severe one is Alzheimer's disease I didn't exist 40
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:04.360]  years ago even by another name today it's the number 4 killer of adults or
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:09.080]  the age of 65 and it's actually a deficiency of nutrients some minerals
[02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:13.720]  and some vitamins but particularly of an essential fat called cholesterol when
[02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:17.320]  they got everybody on a cholesterol restricted diet gave them statin drugs
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:22.240]  to lower their cholesterol Alzheimer's appeared and this is a totally 100%
[02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:27.440]  physician-caused disease it's just absolutely criminal that and they're
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:30.360]  out running around buying up all by the way doctor I want to talk about this
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:34.400]  more after the break long segment coming up I remember because I have an uncle who
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:39.040]  was in a motorcycle wreck and he has seizures and I remember him decades ago
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:42.920]  reading literature when I was at his house where his doctors were saying get
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:46.760]  more cholesterol because he actually had you know a good medical doctor and it
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:50.720]  actually did help him starting to eat the really fatty proper diets to not have
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:55.520]  as many seizures and that's another example the brain is what 70% water but
[02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:59.440]  almost all the rest of it is cholesterol it's an electrochemical computer
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:04.120]  exactly right well actually it's 75% to your brain is myelin the fatty
[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:09.800]  installation material and of that myelin 100% is cholesterol and so 75% of your
[02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:13.280]  brain is cholesterol and so if somebody calls you a fatty that's a good thing
[02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:17.280]  sure you sure of the solid part most of its cholesterol just meant is also water
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:21.760]  but I mean that's that's the cutting edge of people with epilepsy that they
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:26.680]  know that and you were saying this 20 years ago that's correct and that's so
[02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:31.320]  one of the things that brought me to the controversial levels was that in my
[02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:36.840]  original audio cast set tape dead doctors don't lie I said back in 1993 that in
[02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:40.520]  fact Alton disease was not genetic it was a simple nutritional deficient
[02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:43.960]  disease and the entire medical system dropped down we'll stay there we're
[02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:46.640]  gonna break this down at the side but folks you can pull the studies up just
[02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:52.720]  google them you know high full-spectrum cholesterol diets increasing IQ I mean
[02:04:52.720 --> 02:05:00.560]  fat ladies and gentlemen is brain food it is it is the best energy right back
[02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:03.880]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:05:03.880 --> 02:05:08.240]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:12.400]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:16.440]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:20.320]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:05:20.320 --> 02:05:24.600]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:28.760]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:33.080]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:36.800]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:40.960]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:44.320]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution
[02:05:44.320 --> 02:05:48.040]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[02:05:48.040 --> 02:05:53.600]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government

[02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:10.600]  Japanese tragedy proves how important food is our own gas prices are driving
[02:06:10.600 --> 02:06:14.440]  food costs through the roof the huge population countries are buying up
[02:06:14.440 --> 02:06:19.480]  American unprotected exports of food the falling dollars inflating food prices
[02:06:19.480 --> 02:06:25.160]  ethanol subsidies are driving fuel and food costs to all-time highs we are
[02:06:25.160 --> 02:06:29.920]  experiencing the greatest explosion of food shortages and food prices America

[02:07:17.480 --> 02:07:21.760]  outrageous predictions over the years the crazy part is he's usually right you
[02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:25.720]  see he predicted the collapse of GM Danny May Freddie Mac and America's
[02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:29.600]  biggest mall owner general growth properties in fact Barron's called his
[02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:34.040]  work a dire prophecy recently he created a video which you can watch online for

[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:41.360]  real eye-opener I can't stress this enough you should at least watch this

[02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:23.240]  can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which by any decent standard they ought
[02:08:23.240 --> 02:08:28.720]  not to intrude perhaps you'd better start from the beginning
[02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:34.320]  perhaps you'd better start from the beginning
[02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:43.120]  perhaps you'd better start from the beginning too many kids are what's
[02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:47.320]  making planet worse a lot of these kids come from bad gene pools they don't have
[02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:53.520]  stable parents making good decisions mercury containing vacuums may help
[02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:57.960]  not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal pediatrics these
[02:08:57.960 --> 02:09:01.680]  new studies suggest that the opposite that the preservatives may actually be
[02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:05.800]  associated with improved behavior and mental performance fluoride in water is
[02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:09.840]  supposed to fight tooth decay but could it also cause cancer
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:14.600]  the government had the right under US law to conduct secret testing on the
[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:18.160]  American public under a specific condition we have to work the dark side
[02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:23.760]  we will spend time in the shadows any attempt to achieve world order must be
[02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:28.360]  the work of the devil will join me I'm glad to sit here at the right hand to
[02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:36.800]  say it's a need for a new world order someday in the next few years a
[02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:50.320]  solution will emerge Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central standard
[02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:55.640]  time back Sundays four to six we are here you have found at the front lines in
[02:09:55.640 --> 02:10:01.680]  the info war to awaken the sleeping giant that is free humanity to set
[02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:07.040]  brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere to defeat the globalist and
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:11.440]  one of their biggest attacks is through the food and water supply the radioactive
[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:14.960]  isotopes that are mined out of phosphate mines they call it sodium fluoride
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:21.120]  and added now major news in Texas the cover-up of this now CBS Associated Press
[02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:25.000]  the fact that they tell you in Cass Sunstein the Winehouse regulations are
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:29.320]  two years ago but out of report and said arrest people that don't believe in
[02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:31.920]  man-made global warming that's published type it into a search engine
[02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:37.520]  mainline news saying how great it is a New York magazine basically said he's
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:41.400]  great wanting to censor people and that's what's needed attacking me just on
[02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:45.280]  Monday with a cover story he also said that anybody that says you need sunlight
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:49.080]  any of it is a conspiracy theorist it doesn't matter if they're a doctor they
[02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:54.280]  should be arrested he said that that's public folks they do not want you getting
[02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:59.320]  sun and and and Dr. Walik that was a short segment before we get into Alzheimer's
[02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:03.320]  and and the statins that the media the governments have now been saying they
[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:07.560]  want to put in the water or make kids even take statins in fact Google
[02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:14.040]  government wants to put kids on statins are literally destroying the brain
[02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:19.320]  increasing Alzheimer's but first let's get in to sunlight and the different
[02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:25.320]  vitamins it generates in the body and and and then go through the good
[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:30.000]  cholesterol that they're telling you not to have and how that affects the body
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:35.320]  they say you don't need more vitamin C basically scurvy is good for you you've
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:39.600]  got the floor walk through that situation and and why people like cast
[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:45.480]  Sunstein do not want you to get sunlight okay well first of all even a
[02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:50.080]  lizard know that sunlight is good right the lizard goes out and bask during the
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:54.400]  early morning before the Sun gets too intense to get his body temperature
[02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:58.880]  warmed up but also to get vitamin D3 it's free and everybody lives in
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:03.720]  buildings all day and they go you know from their house into the garage in
[02:12:03.720 --> 02:12:06.920]  their car they drive to work into a parking garage they walk in the parking
[02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:10.600]  garage that are business they go into the parking garage they drive home at
[02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:13.360]  night go into the garage go to the house nobody's out in the sun anymore and
[02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:18.160]  vitamin D3 that not only prevents rickets and kids which was what its
[02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:23.280]  earliest interest were of course the sunlight they knew back in the days when
[02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:28.800]  coal mining in the 1840s actually 1741 when they were switching over from wood
[02:12:28.800 --> 02:12:33.360]  to coal in Europe they realized that kids who lived in areas where they were
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:36.680]  using coal for fuel had rickets and when they would go out and live in the
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:39.840]  sunshine without the smoke out in the countryside they didn't have rickets
[02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:42.720]  they didn't know exactly what it was but they knew there was something to do with
[02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:48.640]  the sunlight. Basically we're not supposed to be mole men. Exactly and then in the most
[02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:54.520]  recent research the last 10 years Alex we've determined that vitamin D3 will
[02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:59.600]  reduce your risk of cancer reduce the risk of many diseases including heart
[02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:06.440]  disease and so it's more than just for rickets for kids it's a global use
[02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:09.960]  vitamin that you need every day of your life just like oxygen and water so
[02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:14.040]  anybody who says you don't need sunlight should be arrested from a I'll turn
[02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:17.760]  around on they should be arrested as a class A felony and be put in jail for
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:22.120]  25 years to life without possibility of parole because he's killing millions of
[02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:27.840]  people when they hear nonsense like that. When you have a deficiency of
[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:31.960]  cholesterol not only do you get Alzheimer's disease and you can get
[02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:39.600]  acquired seizure disorders but you can also get low testosterone, low
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:45.920]  menopausal problems because you're getting low estrogen, low progesterone
[02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:49.840]  people are exhausted all the time now they say why my adrenals are exhausted
[02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:53.800]  well adrenal hormones are steroid hormones and 95% of their weight is
[02:13:53.800 --> 02:13:58.600]  cholesterol so you need cholesterol to make adrenal hormones, ovarian
[02:13:58.600 --> 02:14:02.880]  hormones, testosterone for the testicles and so there's all this low
[02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:06.920]  testosterone the low T thing the erectile dysfunction you see all these
[02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:10.600]  ads on TV for all these erectile function drugs in the last five years those
[02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:15.120]  are all physician-caused diseases and any parent and grandparent who lets
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:19.560]  their little kids get statin drugs to lower their cholesterol and there's
[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:25.600]  actually the stated goal of the American Association of
[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:29.200]  Pediatricians is to get all eight-year-olds on statin drugs to begin to lower
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:32.480]  their cholesterol they're not going to make it to 25 years of age and by the way
[02:14:32.480 --> 02:14:36.360]  while you're speaking we're putting up major medical research institutions
[02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:41.320]  saying exactly what you're saying UC San Diego health system higher vitamin D
[02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:46.280]  intake needed to reduce cancer risk and I hear Dr. Dina Dell I hear the White
[02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:50.360]  House regulations are who by the way is for population reduction freaking out
[02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:55.720]  assaulting vitamin D as if it is Satan itself they've got to know what they're
[02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:59.240]  doing well they do know what they're doing this is what makes it a criminal
[02:14:59.240 --> 02:15:03.000]  act Alex if they're just ignorant you couldn't forgive them but you want to
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:06.320]  try and steer them in the right direction but the fact that they know this you and
[02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:09.000]  I aren't the only two people who are reading this information these guys
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:13.920]  know it in fact you're the creators of it and so the fact that they're saying
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:17.880]  what they are doing they're trying to create more business for themselves and
[02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:24.960]  as a result they should be put in jail for a RICO breaking the RICO laws a
[02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:28.880]  rack of cheering laws it is just on such a massive scale nobody in their
[02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:31.720]  wildest dreams can believe that that's what they're doing but that's well look
[02:15:31.720 --> 02:15:35.560]  they've got the studies up one side down the other literally thousands black
[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:39.520]  people or anybody living near the equator has black skin because you get too
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:44.520]  much sun and so it basically absorbs it and blocks it people that live the more
[02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:48.840]  north the lighter you get because you need more sun so you actually absorb it
[02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:54.120]  I mean we are creatures that do not you know live underground like a mole rat we
[02:15:54.120 --> 02:15:58.240]  live out in the sun and it literally drives our entire endocrine system as
[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:03.440]  you know you're absolutely right and and to answer to one of your other
[02:16:03.440 --> 02:16:08.280]  earlier questions which is really on the same subject these vitamins and minerals
[02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:13.680]  we need 60 60 minerals 16 vitamins 12 essential amino acids three essential
[02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:17.560]  fatty acids can be found in your alex pack right I'm very excited about that
[02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:21.440]  that you put together this wonderful alex pack that has all these essentially
[02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:24.840]  guaranteeing all your listeners and followers that they can get all these
[02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:31.360]  90 essential nutrients they can in fact alex prevent and eliminate 900 different
[02:16:31.360 --> 02:16:37.200]  diseases most diseases that doctors will tell you are genetic or that are auto
[02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:40.920]  immune disease your body's attacking the self these are absolute fraudulent
[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:47.360]  lies these diseases are all nutritional deficiencies for instance diabetes just
[02:16:47.360 --> 02:16:52.360]  a couple of pennies a day of a couple of trace minerals will prevent diabetes and
[02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:55.920]  if you have it in just a couple of days you get rid of it you go no one can deny
[02:16:55.920 --> 02:17:01.440]  the diabetes I've seen statistics of it 2,000 to 3,000 percentage points higher
[02:17:01.440 --> 02:17:07.240]  I've seen reports that they estimate by 2020 more than half the population will
[02:17:07.240 --> 02:17:10.960]  have diabetes that what is it 80% of Hispanics will people won't believe that
[02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:16.440]  guys Google half the population to have diabetes and I think it's I think it's
[02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:21.080]  a 2020 but but but soon half the population to have diabetes from the
[02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:25.560]  numbers I saw just 50 60 years ago what was it maybe two percent of the
[02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:30.400]  population exactly right and of course the thing that's changed here the basic
[02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:36.400]  thing that's changed it goes back to the way our four fathers lived in eight back
[02:17:36.400 --> 02:17:39.960]  when you and our kids alex our granddaddies still had a wood stove and
[02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:43.480]  they're putting that powder which is left when you burn wood in a wood stove in
[02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:46.960]  a fireplace into the garden the powders not really ashes is the minerals that
[02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:50.560]  were left when you burn away the carbon in the wood and then the beans and the
[02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:53.680]  tomatoes and corn would take up those minerals we'd eat them we get our
[02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:58.520]  minerals in that fashion we'd also put bone meal in our bread and that's where
[02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:02.800]  the old fairy tale Jack in the beans over in the giant was chasing Jackie say
[02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:07.000]  Fifa fofum I smell the blood of an Englishman be he live or be he dead I'll
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:10.760]  grind his bones to make my bread that's the way they used to do it well we've
[02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:14.760]  left out bone meal we've left out these plant minerals of the wood ashes if you
[02:18:14.760 --> 02:18:19.080]  will in our bread now so where are we getting our minerals it's up to you and
[02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:22.520]  me to train people Alex so they can they know they must supplement to get these
[02:18:22.520 --> 02:18:25.640]  minerals because they're not in our food like they were in our granddaddy's day
[02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:31.840]  by the way tell folks how old you are I'll be 72 in June and by the way you
[02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:36.440]  look like you're 50 well thank you I most people say think I'm 50 nobody's
[02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:40.280]  gonna steal an airplane with me on it I'll tell you that I'm pretty good shape
[02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:45.960]  and very few people can keep up with me and you and that's because we take the
[02:18:45.960 --> 02:18:50.720]  Alex back I take it twice a day I kind of overdose purposely because as you do I
[02:18:50.720 --> 02:18:54.480]  have detractors who would say well there he is wallet died at 300 we knew that
[02:18:54.480 --> 02:19:00.120]  nutrition wouldn't work right and so so I've got to be a little extra ahead of
[02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:03.440]  the curve there so I just started doing it in the last few months and as people
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:07.280]  can notice on there I've had a lot more energy my brain's been working works it's
[02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:10.040]  all available people want to find out more because it's all in one place but
[02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:13.160]  the guy that really you know discovered so much of this that the system knew he
[02:19:13.160 --> 02:19:18.240]  discovered it you know they knew but he discovered it himself at info wars team
[02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:23.840]  calm that's info wars team calm but and I want to get into this beyond Tangier
[02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:26.760]  tangerine and what it's got in it some of the other products but I want to
[02:19:26.760 --> 02:19:29.960]  continue when we come back from break going through what some of the other
[02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:33.440]  minerals and vitamins if we have deficiencies in some of the other things
[02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:38.760]  that the system knows that it's triggering but they want to treat the
[02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:42.360]  symptoms of the mineral deficiency they know full well and they're telling you
[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:46.960]  with a straight face you don't want vitamin D you don't want sunlight you
[02:19:46.960 --> 02:19:50.080]  you know don't you dare eat that type of cholesterol what are the best types of
[02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:53.200]  cholesterol I want to get into the Alzheimer's they're now saying that
[02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:56.840]  people are getting Alzheimer's at 30 because they're living like mold people
[02:19:56.840 --> 02:19:59.960]  they're not getting the fats they need but the brains made of they're right

[02:23:57.760 --> 02:24:09.400]  since 1976 there must be some kind of way out of here said the Joker to the thief
[02:24:09.400 --> 02:24:15.320]  there's too much confusion I can't get no relief
[02:24:15.320 --> 02:24:22.640]  Dr. Joel Walling has a passion for warning people about mineral and vitamin
[02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:28.700]  deficiencies and he has been demonized he's been attacked and I know with
[02:24:28.700 --> 02:24:32.000]  Cass Sunstein he's a wicked anti-free speech globalist I don't know about
[02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:35.600]  Dr. D. Nadell so listen to him and agree with some disagree with other stuff but
[02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:39.640]  I've heard him say you don't need to be a bunch of this vitamin D you don't you
[02:24:39.640 --> 02:24:43.440]  don't need vitamins when I had him on the show once I said but people if
[02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:47.520]  they're deficient need them and yeah there are the the the you know the big
[02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:51.560]  drug companies put out these these artificial vitamins that studies do show
[02:24:51.560 --> 02:24:56.320]  are toxic so I can't say he needs to get in trouble but certainly somebody like
[02:24:56.320 --> 02:24:59.720]  Cass Sunstein saying you don't need any sunlight and it's a conspiracy theory
[02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:04.240]  and we should outlaw this it's crazy when put it on screen you know earlier I
[02:25:04.240 --> 02:25:08.800]  went from memory for prison planet TV viewers and I just said you know I
[02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:13.240]  remember seeing the numbers that half of Americans could be diabetic by 2020 and
[02:25:13.240 --> 02:25:19.440]  it set up what 80% of Hispanics and there it is AOL news 10 years from now
[02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:24.360]  more than half the US population could be of diabetes or prediabetes according
[02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:28.000]  to a newly released analysis by the United Health Group Center for reform
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:33.000]  and modernization so see I don't just say stuff here my memory's super good I
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:36.680]  don't I don't just said an agree with Wallach I've done incredible amounts of
[02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:41.000]  research so when I started looking at his stuff years ago and then when I got
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:46.080]  contacted via an intermediary about interviewing him and getting involved and
[02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:49.680]  explaining this to my audience I said absolutely because even though I know all
[02:25:49.680 --> 02:25:53.920]  this stuff I don't follow it all sure I filter my water I try to eat healthy but
[02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:56.520]  the point is it doesn't matter how much stuff you eat even if it's supposedly
[02:25:56.520 --> 02:26:01.040]  healthy but if it's from bad soils and most of it is and so that's what we're

[02:26:24.520 --> 02:26:28.440]  interview this is a short segment long segment coming up Dr. Wallach let's get
[02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:32.040]  back in to Alzheimer's and what cholesterol does in the brain and the
[02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:36.320]  fact that just like diabetes is off the charts out of nowhere now I've got in
[02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:40.680]  fact pleured in people won't believe it young people now getting Alzheimer's or
[02:26:40.680 --> 02:26:45.040]  are people you know in their 30s now getting it folks this isn't normal this
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:49.600]  okay it all these degenerative diseases I know the main line medical
[02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:54.240]  institutions I could pull up thousands of articles and reports they know that
[02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:58.120]  people don't get enough cholesterol and I put the headline up where the
[02:26:58.120 --> 02:27:03.560]  governments around the world want to put statins in the water Dr. Wallach break
[02:27:03.560 --> 02:27:09.680]  that down well again you hit the nail on the head Alex this cholesterol thing
[02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:16.880]  came in about oh 20 years before the Second World War in 1971 I wrote the
[02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:22.480]  first paper on it was an international journal a medical journal that showed
[02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:26.080]  that vegetarians get much higher plugged arteries from cholesterol than
[02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:31.040]  meat eaters and that's because they stir fry they stir fry with oils which
[02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:34.440]  turns the oils into trans fatty acids which plug the arteries it's not the
[02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:39.360]  cholesterol cholesterol is used for our hormones is used to make up 75% of our
[02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:43.480]  brain weight it's the burning of the fats it's the burning of them that makes
[02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:48.800]  something we're not supposed to eat well yeah it when you're cooking food we
[02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:52.520]  can actually reduce the risk of breast prostate and colon cancer Alex if we
[02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:56.040]  just cook our meat medium rare instead of well done we can reduce our risk by
[02:27:56.040 --> 02:28:00.960]  462% according to a big study humans are meant to eat raw meat all the big
[02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:05.920]  colon cancer studies show that it's heavily cooked red meat I keep
[02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:10.320]  interrupting because it's all admitted exactly it's the cooking it's not the
[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:13.920]  meat the meat you could like to say you can eat it raw is good for you it's
[02:28:13.920 --> 02:28:18.600]  just in fact chunks of meat like steaks you'll never get E. coli from that it's
[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:21.860]  always the ground meat when the guys who are pushing the meat through the
[02:28:21.860 --> 02:28:24.480]  grinder don't wash their hands after they go to the bathroom that's where the
[02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:29.240]  E. coli comes from so there's a little bit of hygiene there but you and I we
[02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:32.880]  could actually eliminate this is a big one else we could actually eliminate all
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:37.920]  diabetes in 30 days in America we can eliminate because it's a simple mineral
[02:28:37.920 --> 02:28:42.480]  deficient disease if we could convince everybody to either on their own or have
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:46.440]  the government give everybody you know 50 cents a day worth of these trace
[02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:51.040]  minerals within 30 days everybody in America if they had diabetes would get
[02:28:51.040 --> 02:28:54.120]  rid of it and if they don't have diabetes they'll never get it it's a
[02:28:54.120 --> 02:29:00.560]  simple mineral deficient disease but doctors make $750,000 by treating you
[02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:05.280]  for 20 years so why would they make 300 bucks to cure you now explain to people
[02:29:05.280 --> 02:29:09.080]  the basic mineral the minerals that are missing that is triggering so much of
[02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:13.280]  the diabetes epidemic okay well the basic minerals that are missing are two of
[02:29:13.280 --> 02:29:17.360]  them chromium vanadium if you take those two by themselves nothing happens
[02:29:17.360 --> 02:29:22.960]  there's actually 23 other cofactors a mix of vitamins and minerals amino acids
[02:29:22.960 --> 02:29:27.360]  and the omega-3s that are necessary for those two trace minerals to work and
[02:29:27.360 --> 02:29:31.000]  this is where the disconnect comes from pretty average person you walk I ran
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:35.480]  to the health food store and I got some chromium vanadium I took it didn't
[02:29:35.480 --> 02:29:39.920]  affect my blood sugar at all it was a nothing less because they're not taking
[02:29:39.920 --> 02:29:45.160]  the other 23 cofactors and this is where if people take your alex pack and then
[02:29:45.160 --> 02:29:48.640]  they throw in what we call sweeties usually within two days I don't give
[02:29:48.640 --> 02:29:53.680]  your blood sugar is 200 it'll drop down to 70 we're on the March the empires on
[02:29:53.680 --> 02:29:59.680]  the run alex jones and the GCN radio network

[02:31:01.480 --> 02:31:06.240]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[02:31:06.240 --> 02:31:11.720]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[02:31:11.720 --> 02:31:15.480]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I have tremendous
[02:31:15.480 --> 02:31:20.560]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[02:31:20.560 --> 02:31:25.920]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[02:31:25.920 --> 02:31:30.840]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off-short cartel
[02:31:30.840 --> 02:31:35.200]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[02:31:35.200 --> 02:31:38.960]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[02:31:38.960 --> 02:31:42.880]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[02:31:42.880 --> 02:31:48.560]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the
[02:31:48.560 --> 02:31:54.560]  Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com or

[02:32:04.280 --> 02:32:08.240]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[02:32:08.240 --> 02:32:12.520]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[02:32:12.520 --> 02:32:16.800]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:32:16.800 --> 02:32:21.120]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:32:21.120 --> 02:32:25.200]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:32:25.200 --> 02:32:29.760]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:32:29.760 --> 02:32:33.920]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:32:33.920 --> 02:32:37.880]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[02:32:37.880 --> 02:32:41.680]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[02:32:41.680 --> 02:32:44.400]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[02:32:44.400 --> 02:32:50.400]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:11.680]  you take a model Dr. Joel Wallach is our guest find out more info wars team.com
[02:33:11.680 --> 02:33:15.800]  a lot of our great radio affiliates are signing up with info wars team.com and
[02:33:15.800 --> 02:33:21.680]  getting involved getting this information out ladies and gentlemen
[02:33:21.680 --> 02:33:25.480]  in fact put that latest headline up I told you that they're talking about
[02:33:25.480 --> 02:33:29.080]  putting statins in the drinking water which so many studies we can pull up
[02:33:29.080 --> 02:33:32.880]  for you show is causing all sorts of health problems statin fortified
[02:33:32.880 --> 02:33:37.680]  drinking water BBC this week cholesterol lowering drugs called statins have
[02:33:37.680 --> 02:33:43.120]  become available to buy at UK pharmacies basically over the counter and from the
[02:33:43.120 --> 02:33:46.760]  Japanese British US government they're talking about putting children as young
[02:33:46.760 --> 02:33:54.280]  as five on statins I mean Dr. Wallach if you from the numbers you've seen as I
[02:33:54.280 --> 02:33:57.760]  see numbers of two thousand three thousand percent from the numbers in
[02:33:57.760 --> 02:34:02.000]  your research that you warned about decades ago all these different types of
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:05.720]  diabetes this epidemic half the population they estimate in ten years to
[02:34:05.720 --> 02:34:11.320]  have it already about 30% do why is it hitting Hispanics even worse I mean
[02:34:11.320 --> 02:34:14.360]  obviously corn syrup and things have been shown in studies to be metabolized
[02:34:14.360 --> 02:34:18.000]  differently but but something else is going on there and we know about your
[02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:22.360]  research and other research dealing with those minerals and cofactors I mean
[02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:26.600]  obviously something's going on here what are the numbers you have on the
[02:34:26.600 --> 02:34:31.640]  increases of diabetes okay we're exactly right again Alex you're on top of it I'm
[02:34:31.640 --> 02:34:36.640]  very proud of you it's amazing how much you keep up with but when it comes to
[02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:40.800]  diabetes right now if you take in pre-diabetics and people who are what
[02:34:40.800 --> 02:34:44.840]  would be called metabolic syndrome victims were their insulin resistance
[02:34:44.840 --> 02:34:50.720]  sort of just on that cutting edge of being pre-diabetic we already are at
[02:34:50.720 --> 02:34:56.720]  30% the 90 million Americans have diabetes type 2 if you throw in the
[02:34:56.720 --> 02:35:01.320]  pre-diabetics in the metabolic syndrome 90 million out of 308 million so we're
[02:35:01.320 --> 02:35:05.400]  just about a third now if you look at ones who are full-blown diagnosed with
[02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:10.880]  type 2 diabetes 32 million and it's about a couple hundred thousand when it
[02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:17.160]  comes to type 1 type ones when it comes to the the population diabetics are
[02:35:17.160 --> 02:35:22.720]  less than 1% they're not a significant factor when it comes to the amount of
[02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:25.760]  money that's being spent but they are you know when you have somebody in your
[02:35:25.760 --> 02:35:29.480]  family has type 1 I can actually help them live be it will be on the hundred
[02:35:29.480 --> 02:35:35.120]  and I actually have dozens of people who have type 1 diabetics when they're
[02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:40.300]  older they're now in their 50s and 60s and 70s and they can live to be well
[02:35:40.300 --> 02:35:43.600]  beyond 100 if they do everything I tell them to do it's a diet and a
[02:35:43.600 --> 02:35:47.320]  supplement program but they will be on insulin because type 1 diabetics by
[02:35:47.320 --> 02:35:52.400]  definition do not make insulin and by the way you got you got nominated for a
[02:35:52.400 --> 02:35:58.400]  Nobel Prize you learned this basically running a Zeus department but see the
[02:35:58.400 --> 02:36:01.920]  reason when I saw your info it clicks so well from the vets I've known because
[02:36:01.920 --> 02:36:04.720]  this is taught in animal husbandry because you know this is business you
[02:36:04.720 --> 02:36:07.920]  actually want to keep your animals alive until folks some of the studies
[02:36:07.920 --> 02:36:12.840]  about mineral deficiencies and herds dying cows not being able to handle
[02:36:12.840 --> 02:36:16.160]  cold weather and then you give them the right minerals I heard this from the
[02:36:16.160 --> 02:36:21.800]  vets I worked with well again you're exactly right the project I was almost
[02:36:21.800 --> 02:36:25.960]  actually a national institute's a health project National Science Foundation
[02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:32.880]  and this project was a 10-year project I did over 20,000 autopsies at 3,000
[02:36:32.880 --> 02:36:40.000]  humans and 17,500 zoo animals of over 454 species venom I was working with
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:45.000]  Marlon Perkins me old mutual Omaha Wild Kingdom days and the nomination for the
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:50.880]  Nobel Prize was for being able to pick out birth defects were thought to be
[02:36:50.880 --> 02:36:54.920]  genetic in human populations which are really just nutritional deficiency
[02:36:54.920 --> 02:36:58.680]  during pregnancy and that's what the nomination for the Nobel Prize as far as
[02:36:58.680 --> 02:37:03.080]  very proud of that piece was specifically for our cystic fibrosis
[02:37:03.080 --> 02:37:06.840]  and actually it's come back now that the National Science Foundation is
[02:37:06.840 --> 02:37:13.000]  recognizing me for recognizing kind of one of those discoveries in monkeys at
[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:16.240]  the Urquoise primate Center in Atlanta Georgia where I discovered the first
[02:37:16.240 --> 02:37:20.680]  animal models for cystic fibrosis and proved unequivocally that it was in
[02:37:20.680 --> 02:37:24.720]  fact a deficiency of selenium during pregnancy my wife and I went to China
[02:37:24.720 --> 02:37:29.440]  we did 1,200 autopsies on kids under the age of 10 who died of selenium
[02:37:29.440 --> 02:37:33.440]  deficiencies cardiomyopathy heart disease looked at their pancreas in their
[02:37:33.440 --> 02:37:38.760]  lungs and found out that some 30% of the Chinese kids had actually died not only
[02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:42.480]  the heart disease from a selenium deficiency but also of cystic fibrosis
[02:37:42.480 --> 02:37:46.400]  which was significant because it was supposed to be a genetic disease of a
[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:51.360]  white Eastern Europeans and not Chinese so the fact that about 400 these kids
[02:37:51.360 --> 02:37:55.600]  had cystic fibrosis well correct me if I'm wrong there is a genetic link but
[02:37:55.600 --> 02:38:01.680]  then it's triggered by not having those key minerals just like boys have a much
[02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:07.200]  greater chance if they have too much mercury of developing things like
[02:38:07.200 --> 02:38:11.520]  autism because they're genetically predisposed but then you add add the
[02:38:11.520 --> 02:38:16.640]  toxic metal that's what then triggers it well there's all kinds of that kind of
[02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:20.800]  stuff you're exactly right there's you know we have to think well here we are
[02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:25.960]  we have these chromosomes right and we have all these genes and the chromosomes
[02:38:25.960 --> 02:38:30.320]  it's silly to think that they don't have some impact they do how we use
[02:38:30.320 --> 02:38:34.080]  nutrition and there's actually a new science out now called epigenetics
[02:38:34.080 --> 02:38:39.360]  there's a whole science out now we're back in the 1960s when I was doing these
[02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:43.720]  autopsies writing our article saying hey these diseases have a nutritional
[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:47.360]  deficiency element to them they're just calling me a fool and a liar and a nut
[02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:51.240]  well today they're saying well we have a new science now that shows that by
[02:38:51.240 --> 02:38:56.840]  supplementing with these nutrients you can in fact prevent a genetic disease
[02:38:56.840 --> 02:39:00.360]  from manifesting itself you can take a disease it was thought to be 100%
[02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:03.600]  genetic and you can give these nutrients and then we're talking about
[02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:07.160]  mustard mystery that's an easy one by the way all three times my wife has been
[02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:11.000]  pregnant we go in you know we allow the one ultrasound even though it's probably
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:14.920]  not good but at the end of the second trimester and then they say let us do
[02:39:14.920 --> 02:39:20.560]  genetic testing we say no but then they advertise because if we learn what the
[02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:25.120]  genetic triggers are and predispositions there are mineral things and
[02:39:25.120 --> 02:39:30.800]  basically pharma you know big pharma is now creeping in kind of admitting this
[02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:35.560]  and and saying then then you can we can recommend things you take that then
[02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:40.760]  we'll block that and you or your child also as you know doctor more and more
[02:39:40.760 --> 02:39:46.680]  big pharma is coming in and and and trying to patent vitamin D and then
[02:39:46.680 --> 02:39:50.240]  put out a pharmacological pharmaceutical grade they're coming in now
[02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:55.200]  with regular female hormones with women that have you know low levels of
[02:39:55.200 --> 02:39:59.600]  progesterone that they would take as a supplement to not have miscarriages and
[02:39:59.600 --> 02:40:03.240]  they're now patenting that and saying they're not gonna let the compounding
[02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:07.440]  pharmacies put it out that have done such a good job I mean so they've been
[02:40:07.440 --> 02:40:10.960]  attacking vitamins and minerals from one end but quietly they're trying to take
[02:40:10.960 --> 02:40:15.880]  it over and say nobody can sell these but us well exactly right I'm the guy
[02:40:15.880 --> 02:40:20.280]  that sued the FDA to be able to say that omega-3s can prevent stroke and
[02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:24.760]  coronary thrombosis I sued the FDA on that one and now the pharmaceutical
[02:40:24.760 --> 02:40:28.400]  companies have come out with a prescription grade omega-3 and it's like
[02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:33.280]  150 times the cost of what ours is and then you have something like niacin
[02:40:33.280 --> 02:40:37.800]  vitamin B3 which we know will lower your cholesterol levels they came out with
[02:40:37.800 --> 02:40:42.120]  niacin now which is sort of a time-release niacin they're charging you 150
[02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:47.600]  times but we charge for niacin and the vitamin D3 as you point out and it's
[02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:51.240]  just kind of interesting that we do all the work and they poo poo us and say
[02:40:51.240 --> 02:40:54.480]  we're quacks and then they put the little carbon unit on one end of the
[02:40:54.480 --> 02:40:58.320]  thing insignificant but but they're manufacturing it so to speak and
[02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:02.960]  therefore they get the patent and insurance will pay for their plunky
[02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:06.920]  little thing that's synthetic and not for the natural stuff okay now now now
[02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:10.760]  now doctor racing through this tell us from the research and as we do it my
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:13.560]  team can just put it in Google and pull up mainstream news confirming it that's
[02:41:13.560 --> 02:41:16.560]  what we've been doing here if you're a radio listener but just just type in
[02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:19.240]  whatever I say and then you can pull it up for yourself your main line this is
[02:41:19.240 --> 02:41:22.400]  not even hidden race through some of the other mineral and cofactor
[02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:27.080]  deficiencies that are the triggers or one of the you know big things
[02:41:27.080 --> 02:41:31.480]  contributing towards many of these chronic diseases that are skyrocketing
[02:41:31.480 --> 02:41:35.120]  okay okay well let's see you know Elizabeth Taylor just died of congestive
[02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:39.680]  heart failure which is a simple thymine deficiency vitamin B1 I get thousands of
[02:41:39.680 --> 02:41:43.320]  people off the heart transplant list every year by giving them the Alex pack
[02:41:43.320 --> 02:41:48.320]  and throwing in what we call distress capsules two capsules give you 3,000
[02:41:48.320 --> 02:41:52.560]  times the minimum daily requirement of B1 and B1 deficiency thymine
[02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:58.640]  deficiency can cause congestive heart failure and also a disease a dementia
[02:41:58.640 --> 02:42:03.240]  looks exactly like Alzheimer's disease it's called Korsakov syndrome and so we
[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:06.520]  can get rid of that disease that one you can get rid of in two weeks called
[02:42:06.520 --> 02:42:09.760]  Korsakov syndrome that's right because they admit that they will mislabel
[02:42:09.760 --> 02:42:13.280]  things as new diseases or another disease when they know full well it's a
[02:42:13.280 --> 02:42:18.520]  vitamin or mineral deficiency syndrome you're exactly right Alex and then of
[02:42:18.520 --> 02:42:22.440]  course as muster dystrophy we got rid of the animal issue because muscle is meat
[02:42:22.440 --> 02:42:26.000]  and Jerry Lewis is still running around there I love him I'm sure the medical
[02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:29.840]  system is duping him that he doesn't realize that for 54 years they've
[02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:33.880]  already known the cause-revention cure of muster dystrophy that's a simple
[02:42:33.880 --> 02:42:38.120]  deficiency of the tracerminal selenium during pregnancy and then when you go to
[02:42:38.120 --> 02:42:44.280]  again menopause and the progesterone there's actually 150 year old formula
[02:42:44.280 --> 02:42:49.040]  it's a herbal formula was called Lydia Pinkham's back 150 years ago today it's
[02:42:49.040 --> 02:42:53.960]  called women's FX and you can get it through the info wars team dot com it's
[02:42:53.960 --> 02:42:58.880]  called women's FX it actually gets the women to slide through menopause very
[02:42:58.880 --> 02:43:02.960]  quickly very healthily they do have to eat about four to six eggs a day to get
[02:43:02.960 --> 02:43:06.040]  enough cholesterol so they can make their progesterone their astrogens and
[02:43:06.040 --> 02:43:10.960]  then there's erectile dysfunction in men but that's a new disease that's
[02:43:10.960 --> 02:43:15.760]  actually a cholesterol deficiency what about thyroid a low thyroid is actually
[02:43:15.760 --> 02:43:20.400]  deficiency not only of iodine but the people forget Alex that your thyroid
[02:43:20.400 --> 02:43:24.840]  needs all 90 a sense of nutrients that's actually in the Alex pack and the
[02:43:24.840 --> 02:43:30.160]  they the medical system is focused on iodine because it's the metal that's
[02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:33.920]  actually on the carbon chain to make the thyroid hormone but your thyroid
[02:43:33.920 --> 02:43:38.200]  really needs the other 89 nutrients as well so and if you don't have those
[02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:41.960]  explain to people that the thyroid will grab other toxic things in the
[02:43:41.960 --> 02:43:45.880]  environment that they use like in white flour break down if you don't give your
[02:43:45.880 --> 02:43:51.560]  thyroid what it needs what it does okay well it'll get goiter you actually get
[02:43:51.560 --> 02:43:55.360]  this huge sort of grapefruit size thyroid gland that's non-functional cold
[02:43:55.360 --> 02:43:58.880]  goiter and all you have to give the nutrients goes away but this is you hit
[02:43:58.880 --> 02:44:02.320]  the nail on the head again for what's pertinent now because we're now getting
[02:44:02.320 --> 02:44:07.240]  radioactive iodine this was just on the on the news on the Fox crawler here that
[02:44:07.240 --> 02:44:12.840]  they're finding now radioactive iodine from the rainfall out in our kids milk
[02:44:12.840 --> 02:44:16.400]  in the milk supply now in the United States from this thing in Japan they
[02:44:16.400 --> 02:44:20.760]  found it today radioactive iodine and this will be rapidly taken up by the
[02:44:20.760 --> 02:44:25.720]  thyroid gland of these kids and put them at high risk for thyroid cancer and we
[02:44:25.720 --> 02:44:30.200]  have to get these kids to supplement properly with the Alex pack and I would
[02:44:30.200 --> 02:44:36.920]  also throw in what we call oceans gold or cell shield RTQ these are things that
[02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:43.600]  have the normal gargagley bound iodine with plant material or gargagley bound
[02:44:43.600 --> 02:44:49.320]  and once the thyroid gland has those it will not be eager to take up the radioactive
[02:44:49.320 --> 02:44:52.960]  iodine so it's a protection it's a that's what I call a cell shield so you're
[02:44:52.960 --> 02:44:56.520]  saying from your research they don't need generally the big mega dose of the
[02:44:56.520 --> 02:45:02.160]  medical grade iodine that even lower levels will keep it from wanting to
[02:45:02.160 --> 02:45:06.880]  absorb as much of this oh exactly so if you take these nutrients the Alex pack
[02:45:06.880 --> 02:45:11.480]  and cell shield RTQ oceans gold if you take these things every day then you
[02:45:11.480 --> 02:45:15.720]  don't have to worry about this low-grade radioactive iodine and by the way you
[02:45:15.720 --> 02:45:18.680]  keep saying Alex pack Alex pack to explain that when we got together with
[02:45:18.680 --> 02:45:23.960]  you guys and I really believe in it so I'm pushing it at info wars team calm the
[02:45:23.960 --> 02:45:27.200]  Alex pack is the name of a discounted package of what you believe is is
[02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:31.320]  basically everything they need now tell folks what's in the tangy tangerine
[02:45:31.320 --> 02:45:35.080]  beyond tangy tangerine because that's what my wife and I just love and I just
[02:45:35.080 --> 02:45:39.280]  got it in the house said it there didn't even you know you know to sell her on
[02:45:39.280 --> 02:45:42.560]  it she's like what is this stuff I'm having incredible energy working out
[02:45:42.560 --> 02:45:47.680]  she's a big workout person okay well usually you know the health and us used
[02:45:47.680 --> 02:45:51.040]  to have to take 50 different bottles and take all their different vitamin C
[02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:57.480]  vitamin D vitamin A calcium and what we've done and put it into one product
[02:45:57.480 --> 02:46:01.920]  using the same technology that has been used for coffee crystals so that every
[02:46:01.920 --> 02:46:05.760]  crystal is identical it's not like powder where there's there's variations in
[02:46:05.760 --> 02:46:09.640]  the value of the dust that's in there well this is every crystal is perfect
[02:46:09.640 --> 02:46:15.480]  and it has 130 nutrients vitamins amino acids and minerals and it has 115
[02:46:15.480 --> 02:46:19.280]  berries fruits and vegetables in it think of that Alex 115 berries fruits
[02:46:19.280 --> 02:46:23.960]  and vegetables most medical doctors can't name 10 let alone 115 and this
[02:46:23.960 --> 02:46:27.880]  gives you the antioxidant points to support your immune system and fend off
[02:46:27.880 --> 02:46:33.280]  a lot of these chronic diseases including things like oh rheumatoid arthritis
[02:46:33.280 --> 02:46:39.520]  which is an infection chronic things like oh irritable bowel syndrome
[02:46:39.520 --> 02:46:43.960]  inflammatory bowel disease lupus there's a 41 year old lady who died in
[02:46:43.960 --> 02:46:47.520]  south side Chicago just a couple of days ago from lupus a simple mineral
[02:46:47.520 --> 02:46:52.960]  deficiency disease you take the healthy starter pack which is the Alex pack which
[02:46:52.960 --> 02:46:58.920]  has the Beyonce tangerine in it it's got everything you need in there to prevent
[02:46:58.920 --> 02:47:03.640]  or reduce your risk of lupus and so nobody should ever die of lupus it's not
[02:47:03.640 --> 02:47:06.840]  an autoimmune disease your body's not attacking itself is a simple
[02:47:06.840 --> 02:47:10.960]  nutritional deficient disease results in a breakdown of connective tissue and
[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:16.200]  so it's really a type of scurvy they just rename it lupus yeah exactly as if
[02:47:16.200 --> 02:47:20.640]  scurvy fibromyalgia sarcoidosis all these are connective tissue diseases
[02:47:20.640 --> 02:47:26.240]  including vitamin C which is the big one for what we call by the way two time
[02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:31.280]  Nobel Prize winner what 50 something years ago Linus Pauling I mean he
[02:47:31.280 --> 02:47:36.120]  confirmed that mega doses of naturally occurring vitamin C are magic and I go
[02:47:36.120 --> 02:47:40.960]  back to this the British was it 300 years ago plus they discovered the
[02:47:40.960 --> 02:47:44.600]  limies they were called limies because and the Spanish are by laughed at them
[02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:50.920]  bags of lime they would put limes they would put it in the rum two parts water
[02:47:50.920 --> 02:47:55.240]  one part rum knowing that the sailors would only drink it because it was
[02:47:55.240 --> 02:47:59.440]  seeing us that kind of stuff was bad for you then but but the British Royal
[02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:03.640]  Academy of Sciences they had to secretly discovered this and actually kept it as
[02:48:03.640 --> 02:48:06.960]  a closely guarded secret why they made everybody drink limes so you'd have a
[02:48:06.960 --> 02:48:10.960]  ship 10,000 miles away when it met with a Spanish galleon in the trading routes
[02:48:10.960 --> 02:48:15.120]  in the Indian Ocean and they would be able to absolutely smash them because
[02:48:15.120 --> 02:48:19.080]  the Spanish or the Portuguese or the Dutch would be laying around half dead
[02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:22.680]  on the deck and the Brits would pull up absolutely in great shape ready to kill
[02:48:22.680 --> 02:48:25.920]  with their sabers in their hands because they were getting the vitamin C they
[02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:32.720]  needed and also as a result Linus Pauling died at 94 40 years longer than
[02:48:32.720 --> 02:48:36.080]  the average medical doctor although the medical doctors poo pooed him for taking
[02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:40.800]  all that vitamin C so I'm on I'm on your side I'm on Linus Pauling side
[02:48:40.800 --> 02:48:45.200]  by the way you know he was one of the discoverers of DNA as well and a top
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:49.000]  eugenicist so I guess in a way you know they kind of got to him and said look
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:55.080]  don't give the slaves this info shut up well yeah he actually was left out of
[02:48:55.080 --> 02:49:00.880]  the Nobel Prize unfortunately for the double helix thing and from my research
[02:49:00.880 --> 02:49:04.240]  he was one of the guys that discovered it yeah that's right actually he came up
[02:49:04.240 --> 02:49:06.840]  with it first the other guys just confirmed it and they got the Nobel
[02:49:06.840 --> 02:49:09.760]  Prize he should have gotten it for that yeah well and by the way that's in the
[02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:12.680]  encyclopedia folks if you want to pull that up but he did get the other two he
[02:49:12.680 --> 02:49:17.080]  had two to two he did get though correct oh yeah he did his first one was
[02:49:17.080 --> 02:49:24.560]  actually for the enzymes inside the mitochondrias there's enzyme chemistry
[02:49:24.560 --> 02:49:29.000]  not vitamin C and the second one was the peace prize when he was against nuclear
[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:33.240]  weapons that's right folks were almost out of thinks it was vitamin C yeah we're
[02:49:33.240 --> 02:49:37.960]  almost out of time here with dr. Joel Wallach of info wars team dot com the
[02:49:37.960 --> 02:49:42.160]  host of dead doctors don't lie and you get great products that also supports
[02:49:42.160 --> 02:49:45.760]  the broadcast and if you want to sign up and get discounts it's ten dollars then
[02:49:45.760 --> 02:49:49.040]  you can sign other people up so it's got that factor to it so we can promote
[02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:53.440]  this out just like 10 15 years ago you couldn't find organic food to store or
[02:49:53.440 --> 02:49:57.040]  organic milk now people have demanded it you can hardly find stuff at many
[02:49:57.040 --> 02:50:00.880]  stores that isn't organic so they're trying to name stuff organic that isn't
[02:50:00.880 --> 02:50:04.760]  now because it's so popular the point is this is another revolution we can have
[02:50:04.760 --> 02:50:07.960]  we've gone over the evidence almost everything dr. Wallach's talked about
[02:50:07.960 --> 02:50:12.720]  we've put up on the screen mainstream news recently he was just saying it back
[02:50:12.720 --> 02:50:17.000]  in the 60s and 70s because he was a big researcher as you heard I hope you'll
[02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:22.400]  get involved in info wars team calm and you know obviously minerals and in
[02:50:22.400 --> 02:50:25.760]  things are something we need and when you take it in these liquid forms you
[02:50:25.760 --> 02:50:30.120]  absorb a lot more of it that if it's in a pill form correct dr. Wallach you're
[02:50:30.120 --> 02:50:35.720]  exactly right liquid and then of course the the beyond taint injury or these
[02:50:35.720 --> 02:50:40.160]  neutral crystals they're very they will instantize you just put that little
[02:50:40.160 --> 02:50:44.560]  scoop in a and some room temperature water it instantly goes in the solution
[02:50:44.560 --> 02:50:50.040]  and so now you have a liquid which is predicted absolutely 130 nutrients in
[02:50:50.040 --> 02:50:53.520]  it dr. Wallach thank you so much for joining us in full wars team calm or
[02:50:53.520 --> 02:50:58.040]  877-551-1301 if you've got any questions thank you dr. Wallach we'll

[02:55:40.520 --> 02:55:46.800]  Walmart CEO Bill Simon expects inflation USA today US consumers face serious
[02:55:46.800 --> 02:55:51.680]  inflation but Obama says it's fine man they say the recession ended almost two
[02:55:51.680 --> 02:55:56.080]  years ago US consumers face serious inflation in the months ahead for
[02:55:56.080 --> 02:56:00.240]  clothing food and other products the head of Walmart US operations warned
[02:56:00.240 --> 02:56:03.600]  Wednesday and he goes through all of those facts of course we all know
[02:56:03.600 --> 02:56:08.360]  inflation is going up across the board but Carl Rove says they control
[02:56:08.360 --> 02:56:14.520]  reality it doesn't matter what the facts are continuing here Europe rates to
[02:56:14.520 --> 02:56:19.280]  lead US is global power shift for the first time since the Bretton Woods
[02:56:19.280 --> 02:56:23.480]  agreement decades and decades ago when the dollar was made the world reserve
[02:56:23.480 --> 02:56:29.360]  currency Europe is now moving to make the choices that are followed by raising
[02:56:29.360 --> 02:56:32.840]  interest rates ahead of the Federal Reserve after following the Federal
[02:56:32.840 --> 02:56:37.520]  Reserve's lead for a decade or more the European Central Bank is poised to
[02:56:37.520 --> 02:56:40.760]  launch a series of interest rate hikes before the US Central Bank for the first
[02:56:40.760 --> 02:56:45.320]  time in ECB's history that means bond buyers treasury buyers and euros are
[02:56:45.320 --> 02:56:49.400]  going to move away from the dollar as it becomes a bigger plum the change from
[02:56:49.400 --> 02:56:53.280]  the traditional pattern reflects ECB's greater preoccupation with inflation
[02:56:53.280 --> 02:56:57.680]  pressures as well as its higher level of discomfort with the emergency bond
[02:56:57.680 --> 02:57:01.800]  buying programs run by central banks yeah the Federal Reserve's monetizing more
[02:57:01.800 --> 02:57:05.560]  and more the dollar which of course is causing the inflation that the head of
[02:57:05.560 --> 02:57:11.120]  Walmart is warning people about all we've got left is that dollar we've been
[02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:16.240]  pretty much deindustrialized with all the regulations and rules and the tax
[02:57:16.240 --> 02:57:19.840]  incentives to move offshore and so we're still able to buy all these goods for
[02:57:19.840 --> 02:57:24.520]  the service economy but as oil goes up it costs more to deliver those it cost
[02:57:24.520 --> 02:57:32.080]  more just across the board at every level and adds cost and once it starts
[02:57:32.080 --> 02:57:36.880]  spiraling it just gets more and more intense and we're now entering that
[02:57:36.880 --> 02:57:39.960]  phase and Bob Chapman might be right hyperinflation could be around the
[02:57:39.960 --> 02:57:46.760]  corner NATO rules out arming Libyan rebels an incredible lie from NATO I
[02:57:46.760 --> 02:57:49.400]  mean you go back four weeks ago they were admitting that they were bringing
[02:57:49.400 --> 02:57:53.880]  arms out of Egypt with the SAS British special forces giving them the weapons
[02:57:53.880 --> 02:57:58.080]  I mean it is it's not a war it's kinetic military action we may put ground troops
[02:57:58.080 --> 02:58:01.840]  in who are massing in ships off the coast British and US Marines but it won't
[02:58:01.840 --> 02:58:06.920]  be military it'll be it'll be helping the population it'll be humanitarian
[02:58:06.920 --> 02:58:16.160]  helping them with weapons and advisors and lazing targets continuing at least
[02:58:16.160 --> 02:58:20.360]  40 civilians dead in Tripoli strikes Vatican official reports that they've
