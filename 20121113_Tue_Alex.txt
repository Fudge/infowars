[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.300]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.300 --> 00:42.100]  Texas Alex Jones it is Tuesday the 13th of day of November 2012 and I guess the
[00:42.100 --> 00:46.340]  end of the world is in about a month and ten days of course the media will cut
[00:46.340 --> 00:52.900]  that out of context I've always said the 2012 garbage is is just that garbage
[00:52.900 --> 00:57.140]  the Mayans didn't even say that I've gone and studied their prophecies not that
[00:57.140 --> 01:04.020]  I put any stock in it to begin with but I just thought about wow 2012 tiktok it
[01:04.020 --> 01:11.820]  is long in the tooth as I like to say okay here is what Mark Fomber who's been a
[01:11.820 --> 01:16.020]  guest on this show before and I'm gonna pull out all the stops guys to call him
[01:16.020 --> 01:21.700]  to Skype him to email him to all the producers attack you're on the hunt
[01:21.700 --> 01:27.720]  get a bring us Faber I mean attack in a friendly way like like a red devil
[01:27.720 --> 01:32.640]  squid you've ever seen a red devil squid attack amazing footage called the
[01:32.640 --> 01:37.140]  jumbo squid side issue I picture all of us as a swarm of jumbo squid attacking
[01:37.140 --> 01:42.260]  its quarry the they'll actually eat fishermen if they catch them in the
[01:42.260 --> 01:48.060]  water side nature issue there Mark Fomber is saying prepare for a massive
[01:48.060 --> 01:53.060]  market meltdown this is what I've been saying as soon as Obama got elected they
[01:53.060 --> 01:57.060]  would implode the economy so they could hold everyone hostage like they did in
[01:57.060 --> 02:03.580]  2008 in October to say give us unlimited trillions more and give us a new
[02:03.580 --> 02:09.100]  taxes VAT and carbon and that's now been announced by Bloomberg you name it in
[02:09.100 --> 02:12.140]  fact guys I've been meaning to do a dissertation on this and I have mentioned
[02:12.140 --> 02:15.660]  it but not done it properly special report on this I'll do it on the radio
[02:15.660 --> 02:19.580]  today sometime after our guests leave us will you print me all the Bloomberg and
[02:19.580 --> 02:28.180]  Reuters articles about the the Obama's gonna propose a VAT and the carbon tax
[02:28.180 --> 02:32.740]  to save us it's only way to keep all the welfare going and hey half a year on
[02:32.740 --> 02:38.340]  some form of government assistance so what do you want give us more money okay
[02:38.340 --> 02:42.140]  we'll raise taxes which is designed to actually implode the economy further
[02:42.140 --> 02:46.460]  because the globalists want to consolidate it and they're exempt so that
[02:46.460 --> 02:52.300]  is coming up obviously this Petraeus thing is really heating up now drudge
[02:52.300 --> 03:00.020]  report comm calls it a four-star circus and it certainly is that's the image up
[03:00.020 --> 03:03.700]  at drudge report comm perhaps we'll punch that up and show the TV viewers
[03:03.700 --> 03:08.300]  radio listeners can obviously go there also on drudge report comm he's linked
[03:08.300 --> 03:13.740]  to our article drivers questioned on guns at federal checkpoint and this is
[03:13.740 --> 03:18.540]  even worse in hindsight now that I thought about it because it turns out
[03:18.540 --> 03:22.460]  they're doing this all over the place where national parks surround major
[03:22.460 --> 03:26.940]  cities and you've got to go through them to get to Tucson Arizona unless you
[03:26.940 --> 03:31.780]  want to go a hundred miles out of the way through circuitous routes so you
[03:31.780 --> 03:37.100]  want to the past they're there like robbers of old at the past and I'm all
[03:37.100 --> 03:41.140]  but the past you know that's that's where they will lie and wait the highway men
[03:41.140 --> 03:45.060]  everyone's known that for thousands of years in different cultures but it's not
[03:45.060 --> 03:53.580]  banditos it's not desperados it's not highway men it's government bureaucrats
[03:53.580 --> 03:56.460]  they're wanting to search your car and inspect your legal and lawful guns and
[03:56.460 --> 03:58.860]  then order you to do things that are illegal we're gonna be breaking more of
[03:58.860 --> 04:02.220]  that down are also gun sales against soaring after Brock Obama's reelection

[08:26.580 --> 08:33.180]  happening we have a corrupt out of control globalist bureaucracy where the
[08:33.180 --> 08:38.460]  most corrupt are being promoted to the highest positions of power and then
[08:38.460 --> 08:45.980]  over time even more corrupt individuals replace them it is a system where the
[08:45.980 --> 08:51.140]  most evil the most cunning the most manipulative are able to get into
[08:51.140 --> 08:57.820]  control and that is what we are facing right now we have seen this cyclical
[08:57.820 --> 09:02.100]  situation over and over again throughout history here's what we've got
[09:02.100 --> 09:07.460]  coming up on the transmission today consulate State Department black ops
[09:07.460 --> 09:11.860]  insider dr. Steve Pacinac you can just search engine his name mainstream
[09:11.860 --> 09:15.820]  newspapers you're reporting on him running fire and assassination teams
[09:15.820 --> 09:23.580]  psych warfare operations hostage rescue negotiations the Camp David Accords
[09:23.580 --> 09:30.860]  between Egypt and Israel that were successful the only time they've
[09:30.860 --> 09:34.980]  ever had a peace deal a lasting peace deal that he was there running
[09:34.980 --> 09:39.700]  psychological operations to get that done so he is a heavy hitter I don't
[09:39.700 --> 09:45.300]  know you know completely obviously sit here and just absolutely buy everything
[09:45.300 --> 09:51.260]  he says out of hand because it is all cloak and dagger but he says he's got
[09:51.260 --> 09:55.580]  the scoop on what's really going on with Petraeus and he also says he has a
[09:55.580 --> 09:59.540]  scoop on Benghazi now that doesn't mean I totally agree with him because when I
[09:59.540 --> 10:04.460]  know what's going on with something I'll tell you when I still haven't figured
[10:04.460 --> 10:08.260]  out exactly what's going on I know Obama's line and others a massive
[10:08.260 --> 10:11.700]  cover-up I've said that from day one it's been now proven accurate obviously
[10:11.700 --> 10:15.060]  was a planned assault we know that there were missile caches there being shipped
[10:15.060 --> 10:18.740]  into Syria that's now been confirmed so day one we knew more than most people
[10:18.740 --> 10:22.860]  because we studied the situation but I'm not gonna sit here and say oh I agree
[10:22.860 --> 10:25.220]  with Pacinac and I know he's probably out there listening right now we're gonna
[10:25.220 --> 10:32.100]  debate this coming up hey this you know was a neocon hit to blame Obama I mean I
[10:32.100 --> 10:36.220]  could see neocons doing something like that as an October political surprise the
[10:36.220 --> 10:40.500]  problem is Obama ordered the standout they sat around now we learned seven
[10:40.500 --> 10:44.180]  hours this is all come out they lied day one and said it was a group of
[10:44.180 --> 10:49.780]  protesters the CIA torture base down the street was ordered to stand down for
[10:49.780 --> 11:02.460]  seven hours two Navy SEALs assigned the CIA refused to go along with the orders
[11:02.460 --> 11:06.660]  to stand down and went and fought for hours and got killed so but it doesn't
[11:06.660 --> 11:10.180]  mean that I'm saying he's wrong either I just need to get some of this in
[11:10.180 --> 11:16.180]  perspective from his position and I know that Lieutenant Colonel Tony Schaefer
[11:16.180 --> 11:19.220]  Anthony Schaefer who's been on many times and been proven to be very very
[11:19.220 --> 11:29.500]  accurate he says it's a hit on the ambassador ambassador Stevens but he
[11:29.500 --> 11:34.460]  says he doesn't know who did it what faction in the government but clearly
[11:34.460 --> 11:40.580]  Obama is lying so Tarpley says it's a neocon hit or Mormon mafia hit as he
[11:40.580 --> 11:45.220]  calls it which is pretty ridiculous I mean just use the term Mormon mafia
[11:45.220 --> 11:50.100]  because the Mormon Mafia's is from a group of Mormons hired by a non-mormon
[11:50.100 --> 11:57.220]  it's literally been Mormon you know the big CIA guy who was involved in all
[11:57.220 --> 12:01.060]  those different clandestine operations Howard Hughes and that's that's the
[12:01.060 --> 12:03.500]  Mormon mafia they were called that because that's so he trusted to handle
[12:03.500 --> 12:08.380]  his affairs and his money the issue is is clearly this is a big scandal they're
[12:08.380 --> 12:12.700]  calling it the new Watergate you've got different senators and house members in
[12:12.700 --> 12:18.980]  the news calling for a new Watergate investigation so we're going to be
[12:18.980 --> 12:23.100]  breaking all of that down and more with Steve Pachining and then we do have
[12:23.100 --> 12:27.940]  Larry Pratt coming on the transmission head of governors of America the
[12:27.940 --> 12:31.820]  second largest second amendment group in the country who's basically forced the
[12:31.820 --> 12:36.220]  NRA to stop supporting gun control NRA supported 68 gun control act has been
[12:36.220 --> 12:41.660]  used against everybody not just felons and let the feds get control of our
[12:41.660 --> 12:44.780]  second amendment to a great extent and course crime exploded in the aftermath
[12:44.780 --> 12:48.980]  in the cities where they banned guns like Chicago in New York he's gonna be
[12:48.980 --> 12:55.100]  able to break down the full flotilla of attacks on our second amendment that are
[12:55.100 --> 13:00.180]  coming not just legislatively through fraudulent law but by rule making the
[13:00.180 --> 13:05.020]  ATF is promised if Obama got reelected to go forward with its rule you can just
[13:05.020 --> 13:11.460]  type in ATF takes public comments on banning shotguns all semi-auto shotguns
[13:11.460 --> 13:15.140]  that can take clips or be altered to do it they're saying they're gonna ban
[13:15.140 --> 13:24.100]  outside of a law and a lot more that is coming up with Larry Pratt in the third
[13:24.100 --> 13:33.460]  hour today that said I have given Obama supporters last Friday and yesterday on
[13:33.460 --> 13:38.620]  the Monday show a chance to call in to tell me why Obama was a good guy and
[13:38.620 --> 13:42.700]  they say your guy lost your racist I'm like but I really wasn't a supporter of
[13:42.700 --> 13:46.300]  Romney but his rhetoric was better the fact that America at least on the
[13:46.300 --> 13:49.620]  surface if you believe the electronic voting machines are a lot of evidence of
[13:49.620 --> 13:55.100]  fraud endorsed Romney shows how far gone we are I agree with Ron Paul's statement
[13:55.100 --> 14:00.780]  who joined us last Friday on that issue we are far gone to a great extent and so
[14:00.780 --> 14:09.900]  that was my point and they just showed their utter mindlessness their
[14:09.900 --> 14:14.420]  political tribalism just like Republicans would support Bush with torture
[14:14.420 --> 14:19.980]  secret arrest open borders NAFTA GATT expansion North American Union they'd
[14:19.980 --> 14:23.860]  say but he's a Republican shut up liberal and I'd say I'm not a liberal
[14:23.860 --> 14:27.380]  because I'm against Bush trying to reauthorize the assault weapons ban
[14:27.380 --> 14:34.940]  like he did in 2005 it elapsed in 2004 he tried to get it back in in 0506 or
[14:34.940 --> 14:39.620]  708 and they introduced the legislation and I would get hate mails saying I was
[14:39.620 --> 14:45.580]  a darn liar I've been in a gun shop in McBrides and then the guy said I don't
[14:45.580 --> 14:49.020]  like you lying about George W. Bush and then the one of the owners said no no
[14:49.020 --> 14:55.460]  he's right he did but the point is I mean look I'm not bad because because I
[14:55.460 --> 15:01.700]  defend our Republic I'm not bad because I love this country I'm not bad
[15:01.700 --> 15:09.380]  because I won't compromise I'm not bad because I understand both parties are
[15:09.380 --> 15:14.300]  controlled but mainline Republicans are incredibly tribal and so are mainline
[15:14.300 --> 15:19.860]  Democrats and the Democrats take the cake I mean it is a new level I'd say
[15:19.860 --> 15:23.100]  to these callers so you don't care that 52% of blacks are aborted in this
[15:23.100 --> 15:27.460]  country and that it's a eugenics program they're like no I don't care I like it
[15:27.460 --> 15:30.900]  and then we've got a whole compilation of videos we're going to put on the
[15:30.900 --> 15:36.180]  nightly news tonight with Aaron Dykes of different black people saying let's get
[15:36.180 --> 15:40.620]  rid of these nappy-headed black kids and statements like that and it's a real
[15:40.620 --> 15:45.540]  sick culture thing evil is increasing everywhere there is there is really no
[15:45.540 --> 15:49.740]  doubt about that so I don't I want to give everybody a chance to call in
[15:49.740 --> 15:55.220]  first-time callers though here today Obama supporters people that are upset
[15:55.220 --> 15:59.220]  about Obama being elected people that think it's great because things are
[15:59.220 --> 16:02.940]  going to get worse a lot faster now you know kind of that theory electric kid
[16:02.940 --> 16:07.460]  have the fever so they break the fever you have a fever to kill the bacteria to
[16:07.460 --> 16:14.260]  kill the viruses to slow down their replication putting them into that you
[16:14.260 --> 16:22.100]  know hotter environment is that the idea here because we are in trouble either
[16:22.100 --> 16:27.580]  way it's time to wake up and really realize how much trouble we're in as
[16:27.580 --> 16:34.260]  they say wake up and smell the coffee well that is the best time I'm waking up
[16:34.260 --> 16:39.740]  I will tell you it's time to wake up and smell the deep tyranny and the road
[16:39.740 --> 16:42.980]  we're going down is very bad because here's the bottom line and then I'm
[16:42.980 --> 16:47.740]  going to get into the latest on San Diego residents face six years in prison
[16:47.740 --> 16:52.460]  for washing their cars that's in the local paper info wars commas our own
[16:52.460 --> 16:56.060]  story this is already started in England see it's time to learn how to go to
[16:56.060 --> 17:04.060]  prison it's time to learn how to be a prisoner of the globalist and so they
[17:04.060 --> 17:07.820]  want to get everybody into the corrupt system everybody getting a record this
[17:07.820 --> 17:12.260]  is how the bureaucracy how the agenda 21 how the tyranny by zoning and petty
[17:12.260 --> 17:18.060]  regulation that's how it works that's how it operates and then we're going to
[17:18.060 --> 17:23.820]  get more into drivers questioned at check federal checkpoints Larry Pratt as I
[17:23.820 --> 17:30.620]  mentioned petitions to secede are filed for 23 states since election and in a
[17:30.620 --> 17:36.180]  matter of hours the Houston Chronicle reports 25,000 Texas is like 50,000 by
[17:36.180 --> 17:39.580]  now is 40 something thousand this morning so I'm guessing where it is now
[17:39.580 --> 17:46.340]  25,000 Texans in a matter of hours shine the petition for secession and that's
[17:46.340 --> 17:50.020]  actually in the Constitution in the federal law the states created the
[17:50.020 --> 17:56.020]  federal government so it's the United States not the the states under the
[17:56.020 --> 18:00.540]  federal government itself run by foreign banks so now they're moving in that
[18:00.540 --> 18:03.940]  direction more and more and you will see more calls for this as the tyranny
[18:03.940 --> 18:07.460]  increases and when Obama tries to go after the guns you will see official
[18:07.460 --> 18:13.100]  moves not to secede but to a null and use nullification at the state level to
[18:13.100 --> 18:20.620]  block unconstitutional federal activity and that's why they've been billing and
[18:20.620 --> 18:31.380]  selling the entire time the idea that Obama is Lincoln and that he is going
[18:31.380 --> 18:36.660]  to you know shut everybody down and romanticizing Lincoln and all these
[18:36.660 --> 18:43.380]  movies and fantasy shows and Abraham Lincoln vampire slayer and Time magazine
[18:43.380 --> 18:47.100]  and Newsweek you know he's the new Lincoln so we're going to be discussing
[18:47.100 --> 18:55.380]  all of that coming up today as well and we're also going to be getting into
[18:55.380 --> 18:59.500]  Rupert Murdoch gleeful at BBC debacle in Britain the giant pedophile scandal
[18:59.500 --> 19:03.540]  that the police are busy covering up as usual you know they're saying that the

[25:20.180 --> 25:25.100]  story or the rest of the story the media is of course playing out a facade for
[25:25.100 --> 25:28.380]  people but before I do that let me give the number out as I was mentioning
[25:28.380 --> 25:31.340]  earlier since I haven't done that yet because that's the cute open the phones

[25:41.780 --> 25:45.020]  try to make you turn in all your semi-automatic rifles and handguns as
[25:45.020 --> 25:48.420]  they're now announcing they're gonna try to do even outside law they just say

[25:59.900 --> 26:05.020]  megabanks that use socialism to get the majority of the people on the take on
[26:05.020 --> 26:10.820]  the dole so they'll sell out their birthright of freedom for nothing it's
[26:10.820 --> 26:15.180]  like Cain and Abel you know Cain sold out his birthright half the land
[26:15.180 --> 26:20.500]  everything it was a rich family you read the Bible for a bowl of porridge came
[26:20.500 --> 26:24.900]  in and he said I want that bowl of porridge you're sitting there cooking
[26:24.900 --> 26:29.020]  so what do I get he goes everything my birthright and you know the rest of the
[26:29.020 --> 26:33.980]  story after they eat the bowl and it's gone well they bash our brains out and
[26:33.980 --> 26:38.420]  then the golden goose is destroyed but they don't care because well they get
[26:38.420 --> 26:41.660]  to dominate and run everything and people are spray-painting King Obama
[26:41.660 --> 26:45.860]  everywhere and getting tattoos saying hell Caesar we've got a whole report on
[26:45.860 --> 26:50.060]  that and you think it's a joke to you talk to these people they're like I you

[33:47.980 --> 33:55.860]  it follows an exact pattern and it is nightmarish now I want to get in
[33:55.860 --> 34:00.020]  briefly into the Petraeus news is a prelude to what's coming up in the next
[34:00.020 --> 34:06.300]  hour and then go to your phone calls at 800-25-99-231 my son who's ten years
[34:06.300 --> 34:12.100]  old who I'm not just saying this because he's my son he's good I will put him on
[34:12.100 --> 34:16.140]  air soon he's gonna be part of the news team here because he keeps begging to do
[34:16.140 --> 34:21.660]  it and because if I was reading history books and things when I was ten but I
[34:21.660 --> 34:28.020]  wasn't half as informed as he already is and I always conflate stories when
[34:28.020 --> 34:32.060]  it's news and information I almost always get it right I make some mistakes we
[34:32.060 --> 34:35.700]  correct it when I do sometimes I'm thinking about something else and I say
[34:35.700 --> 34:40.340]  yeah they've already shipped General Motors over to China now they're
[34:40.340 --> 34:44.540]  shipping Jeep I tell you that's what you get bailing out General Motors or it
[34:44.540 --> 34:47.900]  sounded like I was saying Jeep was General Motors and not Chrysler I know
[34:47.900 --> 34:56.580]  that it's Chrysler my dad drives a Jeep Sahara I'm a fan of Jeep and I knew that
[34:56.580 --> 35:00.020]  but I heard the rebroadcast later and it was wrong so occasionally the type of
[35:00.020 --> 35:05.220]  mistakes I make are blaring and I was conflating the story of Kane and Abel
[35:05.220 --> 35:12.620]  where one brother killed the other and my son was smart enough he wasn't on the
[35:12.620 --> 35:16.140]  on-air Mike though was he he was on the conference Mike were you guys talk to
[35:16.140 --> 35:20.180]  me he was on the conference Mike correct thumbs up yeah he comes in and pops
[35:20.180 --> 35:25.500]  my ear and says dad you're wrong about Kane and Abel and I'm like oh hold your
[35:25.500 --> 35:29.820]  horses so I'll walk out he tells me how I'm wrong during the break we pull it up
[35:29.820 --> 35:34.060]  on the online Bible resources and he's correct been a long time since I was in
[35:34.060 --> 35:40.180]  Sunday school it's Jacob and Esau so shine I'm not gonna say your name yet
[35:40.180 --> 35:42.860]  I'm not ready to just to destroy your innocence yet and throw you into the
[35:42.860 --> 35:48.940]  shark pit but we're you know no guts no glory fortune favors the bold and our
[35:48.940 --> 35:53.060]  fortune is liberty that we're looking for so you want in the shark tank we're
[35:53.060 --> 35:56.100]  gonna I was gonna put him in a shark tank a few months ago here on the air
[35:56.100 --> 36:02.340]  and because he really wants to do it and my wife is like no no not yet but I
[36:02.340 --> 36:06.500]  think she's ready to pull the trigger so mama has got to pull the trigger so
[36:06.500 --> 36:10.300]  don't say your name let's put him on air he can correct me on this guy has
[36:10.300 --> 36:13.420]  written this is no exaggeration try to read in children's Bibles when he was
[36:13.420 --> 36:19.460]  five he now reads adult King James versions and and he loves it it's a
[36:19.460 --> 36:23.500]  great history book and he reads it many other history books but here I'm
[36:23.500 --> 36:27.220]  bragging on my son and I'll get to the news in your calls but son you can now
[36:27.220 --> 36:35.740]  correct me live on air go ahead well dad if you look at the Bible you got it
[36:35.740 --> 36:40.500]  right that they do get into a big fight but his mom gets him out of there before
[36:40.500 --> 36:46.420]  Esau can bash his brains out and also you got it right about the soup as you
[36:46.420 --> 36:50.340]  just got their names wrong I'm sorry about interrupting the show no no you
[36:50.340 --> 36:54.180]  didn't you listen the guys all the time you make mistakes and they don't correct
[36:54.180 --> 36:58.100]  me and I've asked them at least when I go to break to correct me because when
[36:58.100 --> 37:03.780]  they kind of shout corrections at me you know then I'm not quite picking up
[37:03.780 --> 37:07.180]  what they're saying half the time probably because I'm half deaf but
[37:07.180 --> 37:13.540]  thank you so much for that tell us about the story of the brother that sold his
[37:13.540 --> 37:17.460]  birthright and then how I conflated that means come on you take two sides of the
[37:17.460 --> 37:24.420]  card deck and and you put them in together I know you know what conflate means watch
[37:24.420 --> 37:27.680]  the story of Cain and able then I know one brother killed the other what was
[37:27.680 --> 37:31.180]  that fight over that was over that was over the soup wasn't it or was that the
[37:31.180 --> 37:39.820]  other guys it was over actually a sacrificed God because God was pleased
[37:39.820 --> 37:44.820]  with able sacrifice because it was a flesh and blood sacrifice and not Cain
[37:44.820 --> 37:50.260]  sacrifice because it was actually fruit and vegetable sacrifice you see Cain was
[37:50.260 --> 37:55.140]  a farmer and able was a shepherd by the way Wes in there is a big Bible guy goes
[37:55.140 --> 37:57.780]  the church multiple times a week reads the Bible this children every day and
[37:57.780 --> 38:02.020]  he's in there nodding his head so see this is not scripted I mean the crews
[38:02.020 --> 38:05.860]  here they saw my son just came knew how to hit the button and talked to me on
[38:05.860 --> 38:10.060]  air I guess from watching took over the show and now during the break I said
[38:10.060 --> 38:13.300]  well go ahead and officially come on the air then and correct us so that's the
[38:13.300 --> 38:16.900]  Cain and able story what's the other story that I mixed with the Cain and
[38:16.900 --> 38:25.300]  able story you see he saw was the oldest brother by like a few seconds he came out
[38:25.300 --> 38:29.620]  if they were actually twins Jacob and he saw were twins he came out first so he
[38:29.620 --> 38:33.180]  got the double portion of his father's wealth wasn't the other one holding on
[38:33.180 --> 38:41.260]  to the other guy's foot or was that the twins that Abraham had well they weren't
[38:41.260 --> 38:45.260]  they were they were fraternal twins right and then it made the two nations
[38:45.260 --> 38:48.300]  no no that was the kid that came later see my promise I got to revisit the Bible
[38:48.300 --> 38:51.740]  because I know this news stuff but now when it comes to the Bible it's all just
[38:51.740 --> 38:56.940]  mixed together okay can I continue a story now yes go ahead okay they grew up
[38:56.940 --> 39:01.580]  Easter I was like the best in the tribe at hunting and he was his father's
[39:01.580 --> 39:06.260]  favorite but Jacob was his mother's favorite he was so quiet he would stir
[39:06.260 --> 39:14.340]  the stoop he would he would cook no no no keep going oh they just got caught out
[39:14.340 --> 39:18.980]  for a minute and so this sort of constant dynamic dynamic between the
[39:18.980 --> 39:26.060]  brothers where Jacob was really jealous of he saw and one night he saw I'd come
[39:26.060 --> 39:33.940]  home from hunting he had a big deer and I mean he didn't have any deer I he was
[39:33.940 --> 39:38.060]  hungry yeah and he was hungry and he saw Jacob starting to stoop and Jacob was
[39:38.060 --> 39:44.780]  very clever while his brother was very pretty much stupid and he tricked Esau
[39:44.780 --> 39:52.340]  into trading the soup for his birthright all right well thank you so much for
[39:52.340 --> 39:57.220]  that story again this is unscripted and you've done a great job guys you see
[39:57.220 --> 40:01.340]  why he's gonna do so good on air I mean first time boom correcting Alex Jones
[40:01.340 --> 40:06.620]  on air and but hey with great power comes great responsibility remember that
[40:06.620 --> 40:13.060]  I love you that's anything else you'd like to add listen to Vodandi out there
[40:13.060 --> 40:19.300]  go ahead oh thank you for letting me be on the this day or for the first time I
[40:19.300 --> 40:25.660]  really hope it turns out to be a good thing for me and I'm nervous all right
[40:25.660 --> 40:31.140]  I love you son oh man I'm nervous too bye bye I love you okay no more jumping on
[40:31.140 --> 40:37.260]  the microphone oh man okay there you go so he corrected me I was conflating
[40:37.260 --> 40:43.020]  those two stories all right ladies and gentlemen maybe we can have bibles time
[40:43.020 --> 40:48.060]  with with my son I keep wanting to say his name I'm not gonna say his name yet
[40:48.060 --> 40:55.620]  on air because you know what the enemy will do all right continuing here ladies
[40:55.620 --> 41:00.100]  and gentlemen we have a lot of other news that I want to get to but I do want
[41:00.100 --> 41:05.260]  to get to your phone calls on the Petraeus front let me just read you some
[41:05.260 --> 41:10.900]  of the headlines here Petraeus investigation in snares commander of
[41:10.900 --> 41:16.220]  US NATO troops in Afghanistan and it was a couple other generals in the last
[41:16.220 --> 41:22.020]  month the one over Africa Khan has had to be relieved from his overall command
[41:22.020 --> 41:26.740]  it's all about Benghazi it's a huge purge they want to Petraeus to testify
[41:26.740 --> 41:31.820]  this week magically all this happens I mean does anybody buy this exclusive
[41:31.820 --> 41:37.460]  Paula Broadwell's emails revealed this is a four-star circus as Matt Rudd says
[41:37.460 --> 41:45.460]  and they're not threatening so why was the FBI tapping Petraeus's computer this
[41:45.460 --> 41:50.620]  is just their cover so they can say and then you've got this woman on the base
[41:50.620 --> 41:56.700]  who's unpaid part of social help yes who just so happened to be contacting the
[41:56.700 --> 42:01.460]  FBI guy who's sending her images of his shirt off I mean all of this that's just
[42:01.460 --> 42:06.180]  their excuse to claim of why they were surveilling them and they've now raided
[42:06.180 --> 42:12.420]  Broadwell's home was Broadwell a spy for a foreign government I don't know I
[42:12.420 --> 42:17.340]  mean I mean you know is Obama engaged in damage control is this a blackmail
[42:17.340 --> 42:25.020]  operation like we now know that the young lady Clinton was sharing cigars
[42:25.020 --> 42:31.300]  with Monica Lewinsky who knows FBI agent sent topless pictures of himself to
[42:31.300 --> 42:34.180]  Petraeus whistleblower after becoming obsessed with her and now he's been
[42:34.180 --> 42:38.500]  banned from the investigation so that's a way to shut down an FBI guy who they're
[42:38.500 --> 42:41.940]  setting up as well see they'll burn everybody involved in the cover-up I
[42:41.940 --> 42:47.700]  mean this is big and here's this woman this Jill Kelly the whistleblower oh
[42:47.700 --> 42:56.580]  yes who who was unpaid on the base just just part of the social support group
[42:56.580 --> 43:04.660]  yes just like Broadwell I'm sure continuing Petraeus a fair part of
[43:04.660 --> 43:09.380]  criminal probe again FBI they're having to raid everyone Paula Broadwell's
[43:09.380 --> 43:13.180]  father this is about something else entirely and the truth will come out
[43:13.180 --> 43:20.260]  gee think so think it's about a honeypot maybe you know what that is it's the
[43:20.260 --> 43:24.700]  number one level of intelligence operations to use women on men and
[43:24.700 --> 43:30.140]  Casanova types on women or men on men women on women that's how they control
[43:30.140 --> 43:34.260]  these people and the people knowingly get involved in it because you're always
[43:34.260 --> 43:38.980]  compromised at those levels it's it's so they can just destroy you whenever they
[43:38.980 --> 43:44.580]  want and you know it you know I used a an example of this yesterday and CJ said
[43:44.580 --> 43:46.980]  well people probably didn't get it they probably haven't seen Dune the movie
[43:46.980 --> 43:50.780]  which is a shadow of the incredible book by Frank Herbert that if you know
[43:50.780 --> 43:54.340]  politics and the Illuminati of the New World Order that guy was definitely a
[43:54.340 --> 43:58.700]  insider of some type don't get Frank Herbert's son on sometime if you can do
[43:58.700 --> 44:02.820]  that but the point is he's a good writer too but nothing compared to his dad I
[44:02.820 --> 44:07.420]  gotta be honest you know it's like more like pulp fiction I guess they're just
[44:07.420 --> 44:10.540]  churning them out I guess his dad churned out some too but the point is
[44:10.540 --> 44:15.100]  that one book you know on on on how intrigue and conspiracies operate
[44:15.100 --> 44:18.540]  Baron Harkinen has these heart plugs and that's in the movie it's actually not in
[44:18.540 --> 44:22.020]  the book where where if he's upset with you you just don't worry everyone gets a
[44:22.020 --> 44:27.020]  heart plug they just pull them out and you know it opens up a port to your heart
[44:27.020 --> 44:31.780]  and blood gouts out and Baron Harkinen likes it splattering on him it's actually
[44:31.780 --> 44:34.540]  based on what a lot of the British royalty and people are into if you
[44:34.540 --> 44:38.020]  actually look at the history of it because they are a Transylvanian lineage
[44:38.020 --> 44:43.780]  to Dracula Vlad the Impaler account Dracula
[44:43.780 --> 44:48.700]  count dragon little red dragon symbol of England that's the Illuminati symbol of
[44:48.700 --> 44:52.260]  England though the lion rampant is the symbol they don't particularly like but
[44:52.260 --> 44:58.220]  it's the old symbol of England but I now digress here expanding on all this
[44:58.220 --> 45:05.980]  lore how did I get off into that oh the people know they're compromised that you
[45:05.980 --> 45:13.260]  have to go be compromised to be sent up the ladder of ascension into the New
[45:13.260 --> 45:17.780]  World Order barony of being a high-level minion you know the real power
[45:17.780 --> 45:22.780]  structure you never hear about them and again Judge DePaulatano is asking what
[45:22.780 --> 45:28.500]  FBI just doing monitoring betray us his private emails the CIA director has the
[45:28.500 --> 45:33.540]  FBI spying on him over over a girlfriend that sent stuff saying I'm
[45:33.540 --> 45:37.540]  watching you and you better you better watch it hussy you know running around
[45:37.540 --> 45:41.980]  here on the basis basically what she said oh my gosh let's spy on the CIA
[45:41.980 --> 45:47.180]  director I mean the Congress the Congress is told what it wants to know
[45:47.180 --> 45:50.380]  about what the CIA director is doing that it's above their security clearance
[45:50.380 --> 45:53.980]  when Congress funds the CIA and everything else and is the highest level
[45:53.980 --> 45:56.580]  even above the president so things have gotten totally backwards but we're to
[45:56.580 --> 46:03.100]  believe the FBI was in was spying on the CIA director I mean does anyone buy
[46:03.100 --> 46:13.100]  this does anyone buy that we have seen seven hour stand down in Benghazi up
[46:13.100 --> 46:18.020]  from five hours a CIA torture base down the street and no help rendered there is
[46:18.020 --> 46:21.900]  a cover up here that there's a cover up Obama has lied the question is what's
[46:21.900 --> 46:29.860]  really going on here so we're going to be looking at that more coming up and now
[46:29.860 --> 46:33.140]  more commanders the investigation is there's commander of US NATO troops in
[46:33.140 --> 46:37.980]  Afghanistan turns out the FBI has 30,000 pages of documents with all of their
[46:37.980 --> 46:44.060]  camp followers and again the military has totally degenerated at the top the
[46:44.060 --> 46:48.140]  regular troops are having their pension funds stolen they're having their their
[46:48.140 --> 46:51.700]  death benefits they paid into that's their money stolen that's on record
[46:51.700 --> 46:56.180]  that's not even a news item it's just back of the paper they're using DU they're
[46:56.180 --> 46:58.900]  getting sick they're being they're having the experimental vaccine
[46:58.900 --> 47:03.500]  tests and on them they're serving five six seven eight nine tours that no one
[47:03.500 --> 47:06.740]  ever think of they're committing suicide at record numbers seven times the
[47:06.740 --> 47:12.260]  previous record and the generals have brand-new jet aircraft with lavish you
[47:12.260 --> 47:17.940]  know marble champagne all the women on board it's like an orgy this has come
[47:17.940 --> 47:22.980]  out in the nose they're on there with you know having orgies basically and the
[47:22.980 --> 47:27.620]  troops are in she won 30s with the cushions all rotted out with mites
[47:27.620 --> 47:32.020]  everywhere and toilets overflowing defecating in buckets or that came out
[47:32.020 --> 47:35.900]  three years ago I mean they I mean I mean all those troops transports they're
[47:35.900 --> 47:40.420]  defecating in buckets there's there's there's mites everywhere it's total
[47:40.420 --> 47:46.940]  filth the aircraft are rattling apart you think I'm joking go go look it up it
[47:46.940 --> 47:50.460]  was in the news a couple years ago you remember that just type in military
[47:50.460 --> 47:56.060]  transports falling apart you know troops using buckets meanwhile the generals
[47:56.060 --> 48:01.500]  are champagne with I mean this bumbling woman is on the news gushing about
[48:01.500 --> 48:08.500]  Petraeus obviously I mean it's just so ridiculous I just and I was thinking
[48:08.500 --> 48:10.780]  about it this morning then I'm gonna go to your calls you know I'm gonna go to

[49:10.100 --> 49:15.780]  big transformer blows up well the part that concerns me is that the whole area

[49:21.940 --> 49:25.620]  the whole area of the explosion yeah well that that's usually a sign of a
[49:25.620 --> 49:28.140]  cover-up that they're not letting you leave they were letting you come in
[49:28.140 --> 49:31.580]  that's understandable yeah too dead from that sir I appreciate your call

[49:54.620 --> 50:01.180]  not following this this drone over here what what's the topic I kind of just
[50:01.180 --> 50:05.660]  missed the last five minutes I apologize your call bro no not not listen I
[50:05.660 --> 50:10.540]  really appreciate your call here's what happens when we don't screen calls
[50:10.540 --> 50:14.180]  sometimes we get really great calls sometimes we get the worst in talk radio
[50:14.180 --> 50:16.860]  because I have this thing of not screening your calls because all their
[50:16.860 --> 50:20.540]  talk radio doesn't and a lot of radio uses it to get the views they want on
[50:20.540 --> 50:25.860]  air but I mean my big thing is I give the number out and people calling and
[50:25.860 --> 50:30.780]  say I don't know what we're talking about today or they sound drunk but when I
[50:30.780 --> 50:35.180]  say I want police to call in or military or school teachers or people on
[50:35.180 --> 50:40.020]  certain topics it's incredible calls or when I say folks from Australia folks
[50:40.020 --> 50:43.500]  from Mexico call in tell us what you're seeing with the flu outbreak incredible
[50:43.500 --> 50:49.580]  groundbreaking calls so I guess we're gonna have to start screening calls just
[50:49.580 --> 50:53.140]  by the topic so we won't screen you calling in but it's got to be on the
[50:53.140 --> 50:57.020]  topic this time I said are you celebrating the Obama election and no
[50:57.020 --> 51:02.060]  one is calling in about what I said I mean I I said what the topic was we have

[54:23.900 --> 54:28.140]  the state of the world where you see the economy going Mark Fomber top economist
[54:28.140 --> 54:32.380]  researcher right up there with Jim Romgers says prepare for a massive market
[54:32.380 --> 54:38.340]  meltdown well yeah stage just like 08 to hold everyone hostage Max Kaiser
[54:38.340 --> 54:42.220]  predicted it I predicted it Gerald Solente predicted it Bob Chapman before
[54:42.220 --> 54:45.220]  he died predicted it because they do the same tricks they do it in the third
[54:45.220 --> 54:49.620]  world they did here in 08 we're gonna be talking about that coming up as well
[54:49.620 --> 54:54.340]  but they're gonna hold everybody hostage and say oh we got a raise carbon taxes
[54:54.340 --> 54:59.300]  VAT to pay so that all the welfare Queens get their money and really it's
[54:59.300 --> 55:02.020]  gonna go to banker bailouts with the welfare Queens will say yeah I deserve
[55:02.020 --> 55:06.820]  some more money and it's all short-term they have short-term thinking that's why
[55:06.820 --> 55:10.340]  they're poor that's why they're broke that's why they're domesticated and
[55:10.340 --> 55:14.340]  they're gonna come rob those of us the producers even more it's the poor
[55:14.340 --> 55:19.100]  welfare class with the ultra elite pressure from above pressure from below
[55:19.100 --> 55:25.440]  God help us God help us Martha in Hawaii welcome to the airwaves thank you for

[55:43.980 --> 55:48.220]  been trying to show them and tell them I've had the most terrible experiences
[55:48.220 --> 55:53.700]  with TSA the woman went completely into my vagina this last time it was just
[55:53.700 --> 55:58.500]  horrible yeah it's a total act of domination every guy listen if they
[55:58.500 --> 56:03.940]  admit for three years they go in the pants and in women and I we don't I don't
[56:03.940 --> 56:07.300]  like to talk like this on air folks this is what happens in America it's why I
[56:07.300 --> 56:13.100]  cannot fly because now they will demand to grab your children even if you say
[56:13.100 --> 56:19.380]  no and want to leave now and drag them to the pervert assault room and I'm sorry

[56:25.020 --> 56:29.900]  from the old school I dress nicely and it's not about it's not about that you're
[56:29.900 --> 56:34.140]  non-threatening it's an act of domination and enslavement we're being
[56:34.140 --> 56:39.740]  inducted back into slavery that we have no dignity that we have that's why the
[56:39.740 --> 56:43.060]  globalists try to push that we have no dignity exactly you say you're from
[56:43.060 --> 56:47.540]  the old school when Hispanics blacks whites everybody even the poorest people
[56:47.540 --> 56:52.100]  did everything they could to walk upright to to dress nice and to have
[56:52.100 --> 56:57.700]  dignity they've taken our dignity with the MTV culture so that now we can have
[56:57.700 --> 57:02.140]  our dignity destroyed the first step of slavery is destroying your dignity and
[57:02.140 --> 57:08.900]  that's what the TSA is the front line of ma'am go ahead the NDA was the final
[57:08.900 --> 57:14.020]  straw we are relocating I was been with I've been studying where to go in the
[57:14.020 --> 57:17.780]  world but we're waiting for our book for the relocation it's going to take four
[57:17.780 --> 57:21.700]  to six weeks I ordered it the most in a moment you said it was it was available
[57:21.700 --> 57:26.100]  so I've been waiting for it to come but the worst part about it is this race
[57:26.100 --> 57:31.060]  thing they're trying to divide us that way that is the most horrible thing in
[57:31.060 --> 57:35.060]  the world I can't that's really getting me and the things that are going on here
[57:35.060 --> 57:39.380]  on the island we have these these people with these big black cars stopping us
[57:39.380 --> 57:46.460]  already here on the island it's going on yeah there are now federal police all
[57:46.460 --> 57:50.340]  over the country just setting up checkpoints searching vehicles from
[57:50.340 --> 57:54.300]  Tennessee to Arizona in the middle of the country and sometimes they have army
[57:54.300 --> 57:59.180]  there or Marines with heavy machine guns on the news aiming them at your cars
[57:59.180 --> 58:03.300]  and they'll have police to set up a checkpoint and just aim in 16s at
[58:03.300 --> 58:06.820]  families it's on the news and I mean I'm gonna tell you something I'm driving
[58:06.820 --> 58:10.860]  along and I'm pulling up it's one thing if the car matches a description it
[58:10.860 --> 58:13.700]  looks like it and they're you know they're saying get out of the car no
[58:13.700 --> 58:17.540]  they aim them at everybody as an act of domination and let me tell you I'm gonna
[58:17.540 --> 58:21.980]  get upset by that I mean look it's gonna be just like 1776 they're gonna push
[58:21.980 --> 58:24.980]  and they're gonna push and they're gonna push because they're a bunch of
[58:24.980 --> 58:28.940]  delusional perverts if they're not up there with a bunch of whores on board the
[58:28.940 --> 58:32.700]  jet aircraft the military at least the military's with you know with women I
[58:32.700 --> 58:36.500]  think most these politicians are in there literally raping little kids we're

[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:33.540]  thousands of inappropriate emails to a woman who reported harassment by
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:38.420]  Petraeus Mistris you got the FBI spying on the CIA director give me a break
[01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:42.380]  ladies and gentlemen that's off the charts we're gonna be breaking that down
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:45.300]  with Dr. Steve Pachennick coming up getting his take on what's really going
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:50.140]  on he personally knows Petraeus goes to the CFR and called out general Dempsey
[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:53.620]  he said there wouldn't be an Iran attack because the joint chiefs had told
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:58.220]  Israel there wouldn't be I respect what he has to say but we're gonna try to
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:02.660]  flesh it all out coming up this is gonna be some pretty powerful radio Gary in
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:06.620]  New York you're on the air thanks for holding sir are you celebrating Obama's
[01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:12.380]  victory no sir no I'm not I'm a true patriot first off I bless you and your
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:18.180]  staff I appreciate all you guys do thank you you know I was thinking maybe this
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:24.300]  before I get on my a bomb you know it's a push in Obamunism statement possibly
[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:30.580]  this Petraeus thing could be a blessing in disguise maybe you know start some
[01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:36.340]  things up possibly get Obama maybe in some trouble well my gut is this is what
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:39.780]  they did with Nixon and others when somebody goes into a second term they're
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:43.140]  dangerous to even the establishment goes because they're not facing a re-election
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:46.580]  and if a president ever tried to actually act like a president and not just a
[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:49.740]  total puppet they have to assassinate them but they don't like that either
[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:53.860]  because people won't buy that anymore like Kennedy so instead what they do is
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:56.700]  they destroy with a scandal but they don't like scandals that deal with
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:01.500]  corporate corruption so they usually get you with a sex scandal like Clinton and
[01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:05.980]  Monica Lewinsky and again I was no fan of Bill Clinton but that was all part and
[01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:10.300]  parcel of that the Republicans wouldn't go after him you know for the missile
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:14.220]  secrets of Laurel and Hughes the Communist Chinese or the death of
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:17.620]  Commerce Secretary Ron Brown they went after him on a sex thing because that's
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:22.900]  isolated to just that and that's probably what's gonna end up happening here I
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:26.420]  think it's a balance of power thing that's happening but again that's that's
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:30.100]  that we know this is a big scandal we know it's bigger than what they're saying
[01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:33.660]  we know it's an intelligence operation we know they knew about Benghazi we know
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:36.700]  they lied about it the question is who's behind it what are the real players
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:40.820]  what's the outcome going to be I don't think we really know that yet you can
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:46.460]  speculate but I want proof go ahead and make sure the points are well real
[01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:51.660]  quick it's just ironic that you know Hitlery Quinn was going away Patreus
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:56.860]  isn't going to testify it's just really shady and that on top of the all the
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:00.620]  executive orders Obama passed in his first four years should have been
[01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:04.380]  frightening enough and that gets me to my point but he gave us a phone he's
[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:09.420]  gonna do more I'm sorry oh it's crazy and and you know you got people like
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:15.540]  that idiot Eric from New York calling up yesterday you know the thing that they
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:21.500]  that disgust me the most is it seems like the globalist double standard is
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:26.860]  trickle down to to the dumb down masses I mean oh no no no they think it's good
[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:31.820]  to kill other people so they have more more room in there but they don't
[01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:35.260]  understand they're being killed too is that what you were gonna say yeah well
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:38.900]  you know it doesn't it doesn't make sense that the average person I mean your
[01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:44.820]  son is more intelligent than 90% of the people in this country and you know these
[01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:49.500]  guys they could kill we kill we go to jail they could sell drugs we sell drugs
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:53.740]  we go to jail they could push away vaccines we push away vaccines on our
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:58.420]  kids they have CPS come snatch up our children you know and it's trickle down
[01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:03.180]  to the people and you have you know I live in the Bronx unfortunately it's
[01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:08.500]  bittersweet I understand it's the police city-state I understand that but I got
[01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:13.900]  I'm Italian I got a lot of people who were African-American they're not dumb
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:19.740]  down and ignorant and people forget when Planned Parenthood was created they

[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:46.980]  geopolitical movements worldwide we are seeing incredible movements inside the
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:51.540]  military industrial complex what you're seeing from my perspective we'll get
[01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:56.980]  dr. Pachennick's take on this is soft power coos going on back and forth you
[01:08:56.980 --> 01:09:02.780]  have the FBI on record and and even judge Andrew Napolitano is saying this is
[01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:09.380]  clearly illegal and constitutional spying on the CIA director without warrants
[01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:16.780]  because another woman who was involved in in in the host hospitality of
[01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:23.300]  volunteer at the special forces command bases she was a volunteer there
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:29.660]  helping the men in social services she was a social volunteer what a nice lady
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:33.740]  and you've got the head of the Afghanistan operations sending her
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:37.580]  thousands of inappropriate according to the Associated Press emails
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:43.020]  drport.com has it all calling in a four-star circus info wars.com has it
[01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:47.220]  all as well so does prisonplanet.com we're streaming video right now for
[01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:52.260]  radio listeners that they like to watch at info wars news.coms you can see all
[01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:57.060]  these articles and documents and photos that we're talking about but I remember
[01:09:57.060 --> 01:10:01.940]  just a few days after the Benghazi situation we had dr. Steve Pachennick on
[01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:05.980]  who is a member of the council on foreign relations he confronted a few
[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:11.660]  months ago the joint chiefs of staff chairman Dempsey at the CFR and said you
[01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:17.180]  know that he needed to go public and say don't attack Iran that later even came
[01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:21.580]  out in the news months after he talked about it and to his credit Dempsey went
[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:25.660]  public and said it's a suicide mission just as many as the Israelis are
[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:29.500]  saying it's going to be a catastrophe including the former massage chief instead
[01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:34.460]  of using soft power against Iran some want to go to this larger regional war
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:38.620]  that will probably lead to a third world war at least conventional world war and
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:43.380]  you saw Benghazi we know it didn't go five hours it went seven hours we know
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:47.020]  there's been a cover-up we know it was an orchestrated attack why did the White
[01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:51.180]  House come out and say it wasn't an orchestrated attack then dr. Pachennick
[01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:57.100]  said it was a neocon internal government operation as a false flag October
[01:10:57.100 --> 01:11:02.140]  surprise to knock out Obama he's been critical of Obama saying the bin Laden
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:05.700]  story was a hoax he said it ten years ago on my show he said it right after it
[01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:09.460]  happened then that started to come out Stratford responded the mainstream media
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:13.020]  responded and said that a lot of the intelligence community weren't buying it
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:18.420]  so this became a big international story but also within it within internal
[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:22.140]  intelligence it became really big and dr. Pachennick was approached by
[01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:27.660]  different spy agencies massage CIA you name it I was approached off record and
[01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:32.780]  asked to shut up I have not shut up I have been threatened as well so you know
[01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:37.100]  at a certain point even though I researched this stuff no exaggeration
[01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:39.780]  18 hours a day and even dream about it because once you get obsessed with
[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:44.220]  something and you've got a decent brain the world opens up I'm not sure what's
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:48.660]  going on oh there's a cover-up I know it was an attempted false flag at some level
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:51.940]  I know there were missiles at that facility the thousands that are missing
[01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:55.740]  to be shipped into Syria that's now come out we said that a month ago dr.
[01:11:55.740 --> 01:12:00.500]  Tarpley and others did we know that the ambassador was starting to become
[01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:03.900]  critical of what was happening that since been confirmed Pachennick said that
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:07.820]  so that backs up some of what he's saying but I don't get and we're gonna walk
[01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:12.180]  through this here today I wanted to give us the big picture first and simplify
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:17.100]  thinking into more details I don't get if it's a if it's some type of internal
[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:22.100]  false flag October surprise against Obama because certain power structures
[01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:25.420]  wanted in you know to control the middle of the military industrial complex
[01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:30.900]  trough and wanted a hot war against Iran while Obama stood down why he lied
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:34.140]  about it why he gave the press conferences why the US ambassador to the
[01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:39.140]  UN rice shed on all the different news shows that Sunday after it happened the
[01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:44.740]  day after that it was just a protest going wrong why the cover-up if if it
[01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:50.260]  was a black op against him okay and now why are they purging betray us why are
[01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:55.180]  they purging the head of african why are they purging who was over Benghazi why
[01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:59.780]  are they purging the head of the afghanistan operation this is all
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:07.100]  happening all connected to this one woman is this woman a operative is this
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:10.580]  woman what they call a honeypot that's a question we're going to ask and Dr.
[01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:15.420]  Pachennick again is an MD PhD in American psychiatrist trained and served under
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:18.580]  Kissinger former State Department official author and publisher he of

[01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:48.380]  State before administration Steve Pachennick.com and notice he's revamped
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:52.140]  and upgraded his site looks really good and of course if you really look up his
[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:56.340]  name he's been involved in overthrows of governments using psych warfare to get
[01:13:56.340 --> 01:14:00.060]  people to kill you know we're talking about this on air but the London
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:02.620]  telegraph he can correct me what I'm wrong says that he tricked the
[01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:06.700]  Communists into killing the Italian Prime Minister things like that so he's a
[01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:10.700]  serious guy he joins us now sure I know I've thrown a lot out there that's what
[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:14.740]  I do if everybody kind of gets some of the pieces I want to start with the big
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:19.660]  picture you said that there were internal jockeying and things going on I'd like
[01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:23.020]  to start with Petraeus and what's happening now lead that into Benghazi
[01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:27.620]  lead that into Bin Laden and and and what the power structure is doing right now
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:31.740]  with the internal tectonic fissures Dr. Pachennick thank you for joining us
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:35.900]  thank you Alex for having me on the show let me let me start with number one
[01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:40.860]  basically what Petraeus is doing is doing what all generals have done
[01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:47.260]  previously is to basically fall on the sword of emulation basically take
[01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:52.940]  himself out because he probably did not agree with the decision to general
[01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:57.620]  density and Anna and what I call the choir boys the people who are Donlan
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:04.420]  Brandon the president of the south what this really is is a internal fight
[01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:09.540]  between what is the military of culture which was rising and something I
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:14.900]  encouraged against the civilian culture which was really dominated by the TIA
[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:20.620]  antiquated TIA and it's been a power structure fight for a very very long time
[01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:26.060]  over 20 years probably starting with back to the Bush senior going through the
[01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:30.020]  government administration where you had two different types of cultures trying
[01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:35.940]  to dominate our foreign policy and it was much more Machiavellian than
[01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:39.900]  anybody realized it was behind the scenes what you have is a TIA that's
[01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:45.220]  really dysfunctional that is consisting of people who have never really been
[01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:48.820]  able to acclimate to the new world the world which has become more
[01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:54.140]  electronic what precise more incisive and what happened is you have a lot of
[01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:59.340]  men who were in the 70s and 80s many of them were alcoholics who I treated many
[01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:02.980]  of them came out of the Catholic religion I have nothing against Catholicism
[01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:08.020]  people like Dempsey who's the chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff Brandon
[01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:12.980]  Donald and all of whom really were not very qualified to run anything other
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:17.500]  than serious the past failure so I'll give you an example Brandon who's now the
[01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:23.580]  counterterrorism head was in charge of the towers that blew up in Saudi Arabia
[01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:28.620]  he's totally incompetent station chief who's been an advisor but not only
[01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:34.460]  Clinton but went through Bush Junior was involved in 9-11 the original 9-11 and
[01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:39.300]  it's created a total series of false narratives but the CIA has been very
[01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:44.980]  not effective in doing including the 9-11 Osama bin Laden story Osama bin
[01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:48.940]  Laden raid which was false and now it finally came to the confrontation of
[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:55.300]  Benghazi Benghazi is really the trigger point of the entire conflict between our
[01:16:55.300 --> 01:17:01.060]  US military which is a highly trained very precise organization which would not
[01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:08.740]  tolerate the ad hoc or the kind of a willy-nilly efforts of the CIA to create
[01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:12.980]  all kinds of conflicts and the incompetence of our civilian government
[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:18.340]  including Obama including Hillary Clinton who has had a history of men who
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:23.100]  have died all along the side who've allowed men to die remember Foster she
[01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:27.980]  herself has been a very the disastrous figure in our foreign policy going all
[01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:32.340]  the way back to Bill Clinton when she encouraged him not to get involved in
[01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:36.300]  the killing in the massacre of 800,000 people who wanted nobody knows about
[01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:39.300]  sure doc listen I'm gonna give you the floor to get into all this but just for
[01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:42.580]  listeners tuning in right now I understand some of the background you're
[01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:46.300]  talking to people out there in government not just the audience but but I mean
[01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:49.980]  come on you've got the same woman connected to all these generals you've
[01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:54.500]  got about the woman Alex what I want you to remember all of this is what we
[01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:59.620]  call a cover story and a honey trap that doesn't really exist whatever the story
[01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:04.220]  is we're talking about characters now we're the real bigger picture you've
[01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:08.420]  got to pull back Alex for a minute the real picture now is what happens when
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:13.660]  you have a military that was read by Petraeus taking over the CIA and saying
[01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:18.220]  that you're gonna have to now not work Lucy Goosey and out of control as you've
[01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:22.780]  been doing it for 20 30 years but you're gonna be a militarized service and so it
[01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:27.540]  happened a lot of the CIA is no longer what we have civilian we have really
[01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:32.700]  outsourced special forces who have been on contracts so basically our entire
[01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:38.020]  covert operation institution it's been contract officers who make a lot of money
[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:44.140]  250,000 ex-special force and we have the military who's been standing by and
[01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:48.460]  being told what to do and to go into areas that they don't want to create
[01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:53.180]  wars for example in Libya there was no reason whatsoever to take down the
[01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:58.420]  top absolutely no reason there was no reason whatsoever to go into Libya into
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:04.700]  Syria to take down Syria and a lot of it's purely about the payday and if they
[01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:08.220]  continue this even if there's a corrupt power structure there's not going to be
[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:15.020]  an America left if these mercenaries continue to get in the way of the real
[01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:19.100]  you know national goals and national interest of this nation that's correct
[01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:23.580]  the mercenaries was a problem that was brought up to me by the general to
[01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:28.340]  actually of the special forces general ten years ago when he asked me who would
[01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:33.580]  I think would be the next and the next major enemies of the United States and I
[01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:37.020]  said the mercenaries that would okay doc we got to go to break humor when we
[01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:41.820]  come back and recap what you're really saying happened in McGaughy and then
[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:45.620]  let's get into what's happening with the trace because clearly the FBI and the
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:51.220]  Justice Department is now spying on generals without warrants this is some
[01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:56.020]  type of internal battle coup operation I want you to put it in layman's terms
[01:19:56.020 --> 01:20:02.300]  talk to me like I'm six years old doc we'll be right back stay with us we have
[01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:06.180]  witnessed two terrible storms in the east but we are still in the eye of the
[01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:09.500]  perfect storm the most devastating economic condition since the Great
[01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:13.220]  Depression America's worst drought in agricultural history and now the
[01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:16.740]  economic results of the presidential election this perfect storm is a huge
[01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:20.980]  threat to everyone's food supply I just doubled down and got even more supplies

[01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:35.180]  okay dr. Steve Pachenek is our guest is a short segment long segment coming up I
[01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:41.220]  just want to revisit this because you were honest month or so ago you said
[01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:51.860]  that it was a Israeli neocon coup from the information you had against the
[01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:54.780]  Obama administration who you've been critical of but you were saying there
[01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:58.420]  were all these internal power structure coups I'd like to hear the evidence of
[01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:02.780]  that now in the aftermath why would Obama then try to cover up why wouldn't
[01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:08.380]  he send aid there was a CIA torture base right down the street why is all this
[01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:13.540]  going on and how does it tie into five generals now in the last month the head
[01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:17.860]  of african the head of the afghan operation now Petraeus and one other
[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:22.020]  I guess press with the head of was he the head of cent com I mean I mean I mean
[01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:27.620]  this is getting this is getting really really crazy and obviously there's
[01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:31.740]  seismic you know the ground is rumbling in Washington and we're being told it's
[01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:35.060]  about these women I know that's a distraction I know that's the cover
[01:25:35.060 --> 01:25:39.580]  story I get that but I'm saying what's deeper dr. Pachenek so let's start at
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:44.860]  Benghazi place it all right Benghazi issue was the totally illegal operation
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:49.700]  which was signed off by the president of the United States who remember it's part
[01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:55.620]  of the CIA his mother was CIA his grandfather CIA he was trained in the
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:26:01.980]  CIA what you have here is the CIA versus the military conflict going on and you
[01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:07.660]  have basically an out-of-control foreign policy that's run by mercenaries and by
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:15.460]  a military that refuses to engage in civilian intrusions into Libya Syria and
[01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:20.420]  what happened in Benghazi was that the ambassador was clearly murdered under the
[01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:25.340]  directions of Hillary Clinton who has had a history of allowing people to die
[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:30.500]  and then to die so the consulate was really used as a senator as I said
[01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:38.380]  before RPGs for torture now they had the mercenaries the seals had several
[01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:44.700]  Libyan and other foreigners in the embassy in the consulate which was used
[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:50.780]  to torture the victims and basically this was a totally illegal operation which
[01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:54.460]  did have a finding when I say it's illegal it means that it's illegal it by
[01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:59.060]  the International Court of Law it's legal by using embassy or consulate it's
[01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:05.260]  an illegal usage so what you have here is military fighting the CIA basically in
[01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:10.060]  the military coup that was beginning to say we no longer want to find we don't
[01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:12.820]  want to listen to the president of the United States we're tired of listening
[01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:16.780]  to the pushes we're tired of listening to Obama's we're tired of listening to
[01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:21.780]  Canada who really had no credibility and we were tired of listening to Dempsey
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:26.300]  who I had warned a month before as I told you the constant violation would you
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:29.660]  ever stand up to the president of the United States and in this little thing
[01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:36.180]  Irish kind of leprechaun a basic mess he gave me such bullshit they I would have
[01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:42.100]  fired him been a man but the real issue was that General Hum the career admiral
[01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:47.020]  in charge of a carrier task force were watching their own men being killed in
[01:27:47.020 --> 01:27:51.380]  a place where illegally the operation was not legal but nevertheless these were
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:57.060]  their soldiers their special forces and all over the world we could monitor this
[01:27:57.060 --> 01:28:01.260]  for eight hours and you said this a month ago they had two drones over so why
[01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:06.020]  don't the generals come out and say you you made us stand down and go public
[01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:09.060]  because if what you're saying is right and I agree that's where this is
[01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:13.260]  pointing then they're gonna end up killing these guys before they can come
[01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:17.900]  out and blow the whistle let me tell you Alex why because we have created this is
[01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:21.420]  quite important for our public understanding and I've said it for a long time
[01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:26.980]  we have created a general core that is not consistent with what we had in
[01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:31.900]  World War two and we had a George Marshall who would fire 600 generals in
[01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:36.300]  minutes and an hours because they would not stand for it and instead of standing
[01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:40.540]  down they should have never stood down and should never stood down the rear
[01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:44.980]  admiral should never stood down none of them should have stood down because the
[01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:49.140]  field teams that were in there is that no special forces that were in there were
[01:28:49.140 --> 01:28:54.180]  told that they would have overhead cover and they marked the entire consulate
[01:28:54.180 --> 01:28:58.620]  to say look we have to blow this up and instead what we've had is a military
[01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:03.340]  which has wanted to assert power as backed down because several weeks number
[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:07.220]  one America has to understand our military now it's a non-functional
[01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:12.060]  military it is filled with generals who have never really been in war who was
[01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:15.940]  really concerned about getting more medals and more positions but it never
[01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:21.940]  asserted their their their aggressiveness or they wore like attitudes which they
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:26.420]  should have and basically they're making three million dollars when they leave the
[01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:30.940]  government and they go on to go to the L3 okay break it down this is riveting and
[01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:36.020]  it makes sense and you did call it early on I'm saying our military has been
[01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:41.420]  dysfunctional for the past 20 to 30 years however we developed the small core
[01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:45.620]  of the general so I've worked with whether it was the trace or others okay
[01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:50.340]  stay there doc we gotta go to break satellites cutting in here we go we're
[01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:58.820]  on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:18.940]  just a smokescreen for something bigger that's what the father of Petraeus's
[01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:24.540]  blogger for girlfriend has said and he says it's about to come out local TV

[01:34:56.500 --> 01:34:59.100]  his inside scoop member of the council on foreign relations and what's
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:02.060]  happening we're going back to him to give him the floor here in one moment to
[01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:06.420]  go out of Benghazi to the battle that's happening where he sees it going and why
[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:11.140]  the generals didn't come out with this because it's now confirmed the military
[01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:14.220]  sat there and watch that's been confirmed Colonel Schaefer agrees with a lot of
[01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:17.740]  what Pachennick saying he says it was a hit a murder he just says you know it
[01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:21.380]  looks like some elements want missiles to get to Al Qaeda because that's good
[01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:26.020]  for military business that's basically what Pachennick saying this is about
[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:30.780]  arming Al Qaeda for the next stage is will that be terror attacks here you

[01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:19.900]  segment now I'm gonna stand down here roll through it in layman's terms been
[01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:24.620]  gauzy what this signifies where it's now going why these generals are all
[01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:28.780]  leaving what does signify you know shouldn't they be speaking out we know
[01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:32.820]  they sat there while those people were murdered who was really behind that where
[01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:37.820]  is it all going what do you predict number one the Benghazi episode has been
[01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:43.180]  the culmination of the legal operations that have been done under the CIA with
[01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:50.580]  Treyas first with Pineda who was the CIA and basically the CIA is no longer the
[01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:55.580]  CIA we knew that 10 20 years ago where I had men who would work for our country
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:59.820]  they're big basically mercenaries who have been hired out of special forces
[01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:04.380]  have been using drone attacks and killing many many people Pineda has
[01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:08.980]  seriously should be impeached for war crimes he was then brought into the
[01:38:08.980 --> 01:38:14.340]  military and really does not understand military he does not come from the
[01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:21.860]  military culture the military did not set Pineda's view of drone attacks they
[01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:25.780]  have a much more sophisticated approach to the world they're much more precise
[01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:31.020]  they follow orders unfortunately the military watched a series of attacks
[01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:37.220]  occurring Benghazi with an illegal operation legal meaning literally it was
[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:42.580]  illegal using the cover of a consulate which is an illegal cover to use
[01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:48.740]  tortured of Libyan prisoners and foreign prisoners which we were
[01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:53.820]  interrogating and repeatedly in the CIA denied that and was also supplying
[01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:59.740]  weapons in Syria in a misgotten a misbegotten type of foreign policy
[01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:06.300]  which was initiated by Hillary Clinton Obama Valerie Jered and the people in
[01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:11.420]  the White House so we've been running an incredible amount of secret wars under
[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:15.740]  Obama where normally we should have known about it our Congress has never
[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:20.620]  covered it and we have had more wars and covert operations under him than any
[01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:26.060]  other president I know and since he's come out of the CIA he's run by the CIA
[01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:31.300]  what you have here is a cultural clash between military generals who refuse to
[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:35.940]  continue to listen to civilian authority and I have encouraged that to my
[01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:40.100]  lectures at the war colleges my meetings with the general saying that at some
[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:44.380]  point in time you generals will have to stand up the billion leaders who led us
[01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:48.900]  into the war in Vietnam who led us into the wars in Iraq who led us into
[01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:53.500]  Afghanistan you have performed poorly you have performed exceedingly poorly you
[01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:58.100]  have destroyed the integrity of the military and the army and yet these
[01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:02.820]  generals watched while their own men were being killed and said nothing now
[01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:07.580]  it's unfortunate they should have said something they should have stood forward
[01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:12.220]  and instead they were given the cover story by Dempsey who's the total coward
[01:40:12.220 --> 01:40:17.420]  someone I met had total disrespect for and Panetta another coward who should be
[01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:22.740]  impeached and in the White House and in turn they were told to stand down but
[01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:26.460]  what was happening in the middle of all of this thank God the episode was the
[01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:31.100]  fact that not only was a navy we were admiral and a carrier task force sent
[01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:35.740]  back which is unheard of and they were ready to protect our soldiers after seven
[01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:41.500]  hours of an attack and where these special forces units were literally
[01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:45.780]  putting their lives on the line they look save us and they were told that they
[01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:49.980]  would be saved but they weren't basically what happened is this was an
[01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:55.660]  attempt by the White House by Panetta by all the men in the CIA from the old
[01:40:55.660 --> 01:41:00.220]  days like Brandon should have been indicted for war criminals on the 9-11
[01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:06.140]  2001 who's a continuing problem Donald and who's should have been
[01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:11.340]  indicted for criminal activities under 9-11 and this is all culmination where
[01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:14.780]  the military did not do what they should have done which was to refuse a
[01:41:14.780 --> 01:41:21.220]  civilian order and be treasonous as I have been repeatedly and defied civilian
[01:41:21.220 --> 01:41:25.060]  order to save the lives that are military man I'm ashamed of our military
[01:41:25.060 --> 01:41:29.780]  for having done that I'm sorry that they did it but basically what's happened is
[01:41:29.780 --> 01:41:34.820]  that there was a fear in the White House and a correct fear that part of what I
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:38.900]  had been doing and others had been doing was to develop a military Corps of
[01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:44.020]  Generals which betray us as part of a that we will no longer follow civilian
[01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:48.300]  military civilian orders meaning that the civilians who come to power our
[01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:54.740]  president was junior a Clinton and Obama really know nothing about foreign
[01:41:54.740 --> 01:42:00.860]  policy and the people who they picked Susan Rice, Hillary Clinton, Samantha Powers, Brandon
[01:42:00.860 --> 01:42:04.580]  all of these people are incompetent they've had a history of incompetence
[01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:08.300]  and they're an ideologue and they basically wanted to go into countries
[01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:13.620]  like Libya and overthrow Gaddafi who was our ally for years and create stories
[01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:17.820]  that really were not even rational and claim that we would create an Arab
[01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:22.220]  spring when in fact they had no solution as to what that meant and where
[01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:27.100]  that was going and in Benghazi this was the final point of where the military
[01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:33.220]  and the civilian or the CIA came to a clash of who was in charge and it was
[01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:37.580]  clear that at this point in time the president committed not only illegal
[01:42:37.580 --> 01:42:43.460]  act to use the State Department as a cover for torture and extradition as
[01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:49.780]  well as as well as sending a weapon illegally to Syria on rebels where we
[01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:54.100]  have never declared war but at the same time it was the clash to allow the
[01:42:54.100 --> 01:42:59.100]  civilian to get rid of all those generals who in any way could be defying the
[01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:04.220]  White House so this is really a poo attempt this was the taking down of a
[01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:10.980]  real military coup to say we've had enough and unfortunately our military
[01:43:10.980 --> 01:43:17.340]  back down and they will pay a heavy price for it 14 other Navy commanders
[01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:21.500]  were dismissed during this period and that was not written about so that
[01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:26.100]  basically the White House under the direction of Brennan who's a very dangerous
[01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:31.060]  CIA operative who was involved in 9-11 should have been indicted for criminal
[01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:39.260]  activities under the 2001 9-11, Donlan as well and this gets into that
[01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:43.780]  specific issue now the person who's missing in all of this and the most
[01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:47.260]  important person who's never been talked about is exactly the person
[01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:52.220]  you were talking about and that's Mr. Bob Mueller who for years I have borne that
[01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:56.860]  if he doesn't watch what he's doing he should be under investigation and should
[01:43:56.860 --> 01:44:02.860]  be the one who's being investigated. Mueller has had a very very very dangerous
[01:44:02.860 --> 01:44:08.540]  history of having come in before 9-11 one week beforehand appointed by Bush
[01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:14.700]  Jr. the head of the FBI and knew very well that his involvement in 9-11 the
[01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:20.860]  attack the stand-down and the false attack that we had and basically he was
[01:44:20.860 --> 01:44:24.980]  covering that up with the FBI agents is no question about it. And by the way his
[01:44:24.980 --> 01:44:31.820]  number two just to briefly interject was saying that they were gonna allow an
[01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:36.660]  Al-Qaeda attack as a pretext even gave newspaper interviews John O'Neill and
[01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:40.820]  then he died in the World Trade Center were told. Correct and I knew about O'Neill
[01:44:40.820 --> 01:44:44.980]  because John O'Neill was the CIA operative who was sent to New York and the
[01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:49.620]  head of count intelligence to the CIA told me about him and he warned about it.
[01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:55.340]  Mueller should be investigated should be indicted for war crimes he is very much a
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:45:01.100]  part of this cover-up and has been for a very long long time. Mueller goes back and
[01:45:01.100 --> 01:45:04.580]  so does the FBI which should also be investigated but unfortunately we don't
[01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:08.900]  have investigative capabilities our Congress our Senate it's totally the
[01:45:08.900 --> 01:45:13.820]  fun. So we have to develop some kind of body where the American public comes in
[01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:17.580]  and says you know what our congressmen and senators are useless our
[01:45:17.580 --> 01:45:22.300]  civilians are useless but Mueller has to be investigated repeatedly for his
[01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:28.100]  involvement not only in 9-11 2001 cover up the criminal activities but now
[01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:34.020]  illegal operation against the military the CIA and it hearts back to the time
[01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:39.020]  if Jay had go over when he used the investigative powers of the FBI to
[01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:44.300]  illegally monitor not only president Nixon which was an illegal monitor by the
[01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:49.420]  way but use the legal monitoring of every other political candidate and use
[01:45:49.420 --> 01:45:56.100]  that as a way to punish our military and our CIA. So the notion that the FBI has
[01:45:56.100 --> 01:46:00.220]  worked closely with the CIA or the military is so this is as far as I'm
[01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:05.100]  concerned for over 30 years when I've worked with the FBI or the CIA they have
[01:46:05.100 --> 01:46:09.460]  been the most least cooperative group I've ever seen in particular they also
[01:46:09.460 --> 01:46:13.980]  make up their own storyline which is absolutely amazing I was involved in the
[01:46:13.980 --> 01:46:19.420]  Hanafi Muslim and they failed terribly and I defied presidential order and that
[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:23.780]  was basically treason I threw out the president of the United States Jimmy
[01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:28.300]  Carter and warned him that if he would have come back into the room I would have
[01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:34.180]  500 hostages killed but he started it that was basically treason. At the same
[01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:38.100]  time I committed treason when I overthrew someone in the Aldemar
[01:46:38.100 --> 01:46:43.140]  kidnapping and that's what we call a hard coup. There was no question that I
[01:46:43.140 --> 01:46:48.420]  overrode the CIA, overrode military orders, overrode civilian orders but in my
[01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:53.980]  opinion and at the directives whoever it was and my own opinion I was able to do
[01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:57.820]  that and to those years nobody could understand it that's why I was able to
[01:46:57.820 --> 01:47:03.260]  override the CIA and either fire dismiss them or marginalize them. Well now that you
[01:47:03.260 --> 01:47:06.620]  told the Jimmy Carter story I looked it up it's on record that you were the
[01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:11.420]  State Department representative at the famous Camp David Accord we should have
[01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:16.380]  you on just about the history sometime but let me get back to this story of why
[01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:20.700]  this but I mean let's get back to you what happened with President Carter? Well
[01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:25.460]  Jimmy Carter, President Carter had initially created a guy himself involved
[01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:29.820]  in a bank holdup where he was micromanaging everything and as a result
[01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:35.900]  of that what happened was a man by the name Khalid who had saw his daughter
[01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:41.180]  drowned by the Elijah Muhammad group held five different building hostages
[01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:46.740]  including the name Britt, shot Mayor Barry and we had 500 hostages. The FBI could
[01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:51.860]  not handle it, the CIA could not handle it and I was called in the middle of the
[01:47:51.860 --> 01:47:56.940]  night to take it over and Earl Silver who was at that time not my friend but with
[01:47:56.940 --> 01:48:01.540]  the US Attorney General I told him that whatever happens will be answered, will
[01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:05.980]  have a gag ordered, no one is to talk, nobody's to say anything and I took over
[01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:10.940]  complete command and control. There were three ambassadors for my Yahu Khan from
[01:48:10.940 --> 01:48:15.940]  Pakistan from Egypt and from Iran all of whom were just sitting there so I
[01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:19.980]  provided the Quran I quickly formulated the strategy and tactics where I took
[01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:24.300]  over the control of Khalid and told him that this is what's going to happen and
[01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:30.980]  through a colonnade who was a very good police officer we were able to change
[01:48:30.980 --> 01:48:35.820]  the entire course of a disastrous event where 500 people with napalm on the
[01:48:35.820 --> 01:48:41.340]  stairwell was about to die and Jimmy Carter had no understanding of it
[01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:45.340]  neither did his people and I literally threw them out and I warned them that if
[01:48:45.340 --> 01:48:51.300]  they did come in they will have a blood death on their hands. Sure and that's on
[01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:54.700]  record too, it sounds amazing to listeners. This is not something I... Let's
[01:48:54.700 --> 01:48:58.460]  expand on this, let's expand on this then. I'm just letting people know the
[01:48:58.460 --> 01:49:02.740]  kind of stuff you've done and what you've seen. Where is this going now where
[01:49:02.740 --> 01:49:06.460]  mercenaries because the US has been corrupt for a long time and that's part
[01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:09.420]  of the whole Machiavellian system and you know when you have danced with the
[01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:15.060]  devil you the devil doesn't change you change but now you can see it that what
[01:49:15.060 --> 01:49:20.340]  these mercenaries and the CIA and 80% of intelligence now run by private groups
[01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:24.540]  I found an NSA base by my house and have confirmed it what's a private group
[01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:28.220]  data mining I mean that's how bad it is it's just everywhere now they've made
[01:49:28.220 --> 01:49:30.900]  the American people their enemy too because that's a new battlefield for
[01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:35.220]  them they don't care about long term now they really just want their paychecks
[01:49:35.220 --> 01:49:40.220]  you've got contractors low level paid more than top generals and and so it's
[01:49:40.220 --> 01:49:45.140]  a private corporate coup that we see happening and they brag about it where
[01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:51.860]  is it going then well it is going into the into a major confrontation with our
[01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:57.380]  military because for every mercenary who's basically was either ex-special
[01:49:57.380 --> 01:50:05.620]  forces receives $250,000 and you put in a special forces legal soldier next to
[01:50:05.620 --> 01:50:10.100]  him and he's only making 40 or 50,000 you're gonna get real conflicts and I
[01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:13.860]  remember telling General Schumacher they had a special forces on the head of the
[01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:18.820]  army and years ago that our major enemy within five to ten years and it's
[01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:24.300]  right now about Benghazi will be those mercenaries under L3 under North
[01:50:24.300 --> 01:50:29.380]  the Grumman under all the companies that have been outsourced and and Panetta has
[01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:34.060]  been one of the greatest uses of these L3 communications as that's the CIA
[01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:38.220]  by the way they plan to use L3 domestically for civil unrest they got a
[01:50:38.220 --> 01:50:41.860]  giant training base here in Texas stay there I want to come back then and just
[01:50:41.860 --> 01:50:48.900]  zero in why did Obama stand down then if it was some type of internal operation
[01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:53.860]  with the neocons wanting to get missiles you know into the next theater to expand
[01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:58.740]  the war why did Obama play into their hands or is he joined up with these
[01:50:58.740 --> 01:51:03.060]  people I mean I want to zero in on this have you ever wanted to generate your

[01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:14.780]  war room at the Pentagon when they realized there was no possibility of
[01:54:14.780 --> 01:54:20.260]  recalling the wing will be only one course of action over total commitment
[01:54:20.260 --> 01:54:26.740]  mandry you recall what Clemens once said about war I know I didn't think I do
[01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:31.220]  something else he said war was too important to be left to the generals
[01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:39.460]  when he said that 50 years ago he might have been right but today war is too
[01:54:39.460 --> 01:54:46.260]  important to be left to politicians they have neither the time the training or
[01:54:46.260 --> 01:54:53.020]  the inclination for strategic thought resistance to tyrants is obedience to
[01:54:53.020 --> 01:55:00.860]  God it's Alex Jones okay we got one more segment here and then another two more
[01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:04.860]  segments short ones with dr. Steve Pacanik riveting powerful interview
[01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:08.620]  unfortunately so much is what he's saying I can just verify from open
[01:55:08.620 --> 01:55:13.260]  intelligence reading between the lines here we were I was saying isn't it about
[01:55:13.260 --> 01:55:18.100]  phasing out the military converting it to a social enforcement thing
[01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:22.340]  domestically everything going to drones controlled by mega corporations that have
[01:55:22.340 --> 01:55:27.500]  hijacked our country and he said bingo that's it so dr. Pacanik you also another
[01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:31.180]  announcement you wanted to make about the CFR breakdown geopolitically where
[01:55:31.180 --> 01:55:34.060]  all this is going because soon the mercenaries are going to be cut out of
[01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:38.980]  the equation to the new world order it likes robots it likes drones it likes
[01:55:38.980 --> 01:55:42.580]  drone subs and drone ships explain where we're going
[01:55:42.580 --> 01:55:47.820]  basically this is the end of the army we no longer really need an army it will be
[01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:53.300]  decreased in size they know this it's the end we don't need army units we don't
[01:55:53.300 --> 01:55:57.540]  need the teeth to tail ratio then in other words the amount of supply that we
[01:55:57.540 --> 01:56:02.580]  need to get actual fighters in would not done well it's very high so basically
[01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:08.060]  where we are going into is a new kind of warfare which is space warfare cyber war
[01:56:08.060 --> 01:56:13.540]  and cyber attack which is really very important doesn't belong to the army it
[01:56:13.540 --> 01:56:17.420]  really now belongs to a whole new concept that which the United States has to
[01:56:17.420 --> 01:56:21.900]  begin to understand which has to deal with private industry and working in
[01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:28.180]  cyber war and cyber security because the army isn't necessarily designated or
[01:56:28.180 --> 01:56:32.100]  have been trained in cyber war and cyber attack although they're interested in it
[01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:38.340]  it's not the cynical unknown their reason so what you have is the elimination of
[01:56:38.340 --> 01:56:42.700]  really war structures that can effectively change the world powers what
[01:56:42.700 --> 01:56:47.580]  can change world powers it's now social media statements like what you make what
[01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:52.940]  we do the CFRs have finished I quit as I told you I was dying it was it was an
[01:56:52.940 --> 01:56:58.420]  antiquated rest home for you know very you know retarded individuals who were
[01:56:58.420 --> 01:57:01.900]  just what you got to get in Jim C's face there it's still useful for that well
[01:57:01.900 --> 01:57:06.860]  but Dempsey is a coward I mean if I was if I were what I normally was George
[01:57:06.860 --> 01:57:11.220]  Marshall I would have fired him on spot I would have fired 600 generals on spot
[01:57:11.220 --> 01:57:15.140]  we don't do that anymore instead we promote the generals we give them pensions
[01:57:15.140 --> 01:57:18.580]  for three million dollars so they're useless sure bottom line where's it
[01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:23.300]  going with Obama then how bad is this is going to be heading into a very serious
[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:27.740]  problem of impeachment he continues all these wars that are illegal wars which
[01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:31.700]  have not been overseen by the Congress and an almost effective Congress but
[01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:36.380]  the American public understands this is not just the president who quietly goes
[01:57:36.380 --> 01:57:41.060]  around and does what he does he has been ordering these overt operations for
[01:57:41.060 --> 01:57:46.420]  years on end and as a product of the CIA and can no longer continue this we will
[01:57:46.420 --> 01:57:51.100]  implode in terms of both our national security and also our military will
[01:57:51.100 --> 01:57:55.820]  refuse to follow any more orders and in particular I talk about our Air Force
[01:57:55.820 --> 01:58:01.260]  which is in space warfare which has to do with satellite warfare and our Navy
[01:58:01.260 --> 01:58:05.820]  because our Navy when you talk about our Navy nobody's really talked about our
[01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:10.940]  nuclear subs and our our fleets what we call sync pack commander and other
[01:58:10.940 --> 01:58:16.860]  Pacific or the nuclear drone subs they have those classified missile platforms
[01:58:16.860 --> 01:58:21.580]  that have been around for 20 years right so some kind of deterrence is required
[01:58:21.580 --> 01:58:26.620]  are we going to be going into another major war no but we have created under
[01:58:26.620 --> 01:58:32.020]  Obama and the Bush administration more unnecessary wars thanks to the CIA
[01:58:32.020 --> 01:58:36.100]  thanks to incompetent civilians and incompetent generals who wanted to just

[02:00:05.020 --> 02:00:12.820]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.820 --> 02:00:20.340]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.340 --> 02:00:26.860]  Alex Jones well we were just talking about space-based weapons and how
[02:00:26.860 --> 02:00:30.220]  advanced they really are with Dr. Pachennick we got five minutes doc and
[02:00:30.220 --> 02:00:35.620]  Larry Pratt's coming up folks on the assault on the Second Amendment government
[02:00:35.620 --> 02:00:38.780]  is getting more and more corrupt more more out of control look at the Secret
[02:00:38.780 --> 02:00:43.700]  Service and the hookers all of it we've got all these super weapons but they're
[02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:47.260]  starting all these wars they're trying to convert America to the police state
[02:00:47.260 --> 02:00:51.580]  what's the establishment's grand plan and is there any way to turn it around
[02:00:51.580 --> 02:00:56.260]  in your view dr. Pachennick yes I think it's very easy that the American public
[02:00:56.260 --> 02:01:00.940]  now yesterday started requiring that states rights they wanted to secede from
[02:01:00.940 --> 02:01:05.020]  the Union I think this is something I wrote about 10 20 years ago in state of
[02:01:05.020 --> 02:01:09.460]  emergency that the federal government has lost its legitimacy across the board
[02:01:09.460 --> 02:01:14.100]  on the civilian side legislative executive judicial on the military and
[02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:19.340]  the intelligence side it is no longer legitimate body of our national of our
[02:01:19.340 --> 02:01:24.700]  Republic it has become a serious problem to our Republic and the sustaining of
[02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:29.020]  the ability of the Republic to remain so therefore the question becomes does the
[02:01:29.020 --> 02:01:33.500]  Republic really have legitimacy and the answer is no the federal government has
[02:01:33.500 --> 02:01:37.740]  lost its legitimacy and I think those who are requiring and asking for states
[02:01:37.740 --> 02:01:41.700]  rights I think are right I wrote about in the state of emergency when I said
[02:01:41.700 --> 02:01:46.340]  state after state will fight over water resources and that from now on our
[02:01:46.340 --> 02:01:49.980]  country has to be concerned about domestic issues taking care of our
[02:01:49.980 --> 02:01:54.140]  veterans taking care of people's jobs and making sure that we grow domestically
[02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:58.500]  and not fund some military industrial complex that generalize and how one of
[02:01:58.500 --> 02:02:03.220]  our greatest generals said we no longer need is dangerous and at the same time
[02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:08.780]  warned the CIA that they would to create a legacy of ashes his words have come
[02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:13.420]  back to resonate 40 50 years later we have to decrease and eliminate most of
[02:02:13.420 --> 02:02:18.660]  our military across the board just as George Marshall did when he fired 6 to
[02:02:18.660 --> 02:02:23.780]  700 generals in one day Eisenhower kept firing them until young men who were
[02:02:23.780 --> 02:02:29.500]  26 and 27 were division commanders we don't need an army anymore we have space
[02:02:29.500 --> 02:02:34.140]  warfare we have cyber war we don't need that and the notion that we really need
[02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:39.020]  is the greatest national security problem we have is our national debt and the
[02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:42.780]  greatest problem in our national debt is that we're not really developing our
[02:02:42.780 --> 02:02:47.820]  own economic strength force and in doing that we have to now get rid of those
[02:02:47.820 --> 02:02:51.620]  people who have committed the crimes against the state number one is new
[02:02:51.620 --> 02:02:55.060]  learn I think you should be brought forth more than anybody else and
[02:02:55.060 --> 02:02:59.660]  investigate it for what he has been investigating number two is the CIA and
[02:02:59.660 --> 02:03:03.820]  they should be eliminated completely number three the generals about three to
[02:03:03.820 --> 02:03:08.260]  four hundred should be dismissed right away and taken down to the simplest core
[02:03:08.260 --> 02:03:13.700]  of special forces number four I think everybody involved in this Benghazi
[02:03:13.700 --> 02:03:17.740]  attack from Hillary Clinton should be indicted for war crime the president
[02:03:17.740 --> 02:03:21.060]  should be possibly impeached every one of the men in the White House
[02:03:21.060 --> 02:03:26.420]  Donlan Brandon particularly should be impeached and indicted and as well as
[02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:32.460]  a clapper and the DNI which is totally useless and General Dempsey should be
[02:03:32.460 --> 02:03:36.540]  court martial that's my opinion I think that's what's going to happen I think
[02:03:36.540 --> 02:03:41.420]  the American public is sick and tired of corruption of excuses of lies and
[02:03:41.420 --> 02:03:45.180]  throughout the world we have been the only country that has lived through those
[02:03:45.180 --> 02:03:48.940]  lies and have been able to break through them the American public is not
[02:03:48.940 --> 02:03:54.860]  stupid they will not tolerate that but the lies of 9-11 have come back of 2001
[02:03:54.860 --> 02:04:01.740]  to recapitulate again the lies Benghazi of 9-11 Congress needs to
[02:04:01.740 --> 02:04:06.660]  wake up but it represents nothing Congress is now a dead body has very
[02:04:06.660 --> 02:04:10.540]  little legitimacy the White House has very little legitimacy and so all we have
[02:04:10.540 --> 02:04:15.500]  is giant organized crime syndicates battling for taxpayer money that's why
[02:04:15.500 --> 02:04:18.700]  they want to keep raising taxes to get more corporate welfare and they
[02:04:18.700 --> 02:04:23.220]  plan on using the giant welfare hordes as the political muscle to vote the
[02:04:23.220 --> 02:04:26.700]  middle classes money directly into the bankers hands while the dumb down
[02:04:26.700 --> 02:04:31.180]  welfare queen that queens drool demanding more goodies I think it goes
[02:04:31.180 --> 02:04:34.900]  back to the original statement I made 10 years ago on your first show which said
[02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:39.180]  we needed a revolution revolution doesn't have to be violent it has to be one
[02:04:39.180 --> 02:04:44.900]  which takes down the totally corrupt White House totally corrupt Congress
[02:04:44.900 --> 02:04:50.700]  totally corrupt judicial system totally corrupt FBI secret service it's

[02:08:30.980 --> 02:08:43.460]  welcome to another live hour of the alex jones show and I think you guessed it I
[02:08:43.460 --> 02:08:47.980]  am alex jones and we've got a lot of new listeners tuning in every day as the
[02:08:47.980 --> 02:08:55.220]  broadcast continues to explode well the bugle has sounded the charge has begun
[02:08:55.220 --> 02:09:02.100]  Obama is not facing reelection he has the power of the executive order he has
[02:09:02.100 --> 02:09:06.900]  shown he'll use it like no other president and he as a state senator and
[02:09:06.900 --> 02:09:11.060]  a US senator we did this in a report last week read the clothes from the
[02:09:11.060 --> 02:09:16.580]  voter guides there in Illinois he said he believes in the abolition of private
[02:09:16.580 --> 02:09:20.900]  ownership he believes in a total ban of guns you see Chicago total ban you see
[02:09:20.900 --> 02:09:25.460]  New York total ban for the general public if you're kind of the mafia
[02:09:25.460 --> 02:09:28.580]  connected big wigs they can get you know armed guards or whatever you know the
[02:09:28.580 --> 02:09:31.520]  mercenaries they're always love to have their guns the UN's above the law they
[02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:35.740]  can rape and kill whoever they want get the diplomatic immunity in any city so
[02:09:35.740 --> 02:09:38.980]  that's that's what it's all about the government massing weaponry against this
[02:09:38.980 --> 02:09:44.180]  private mercenaries but we can't have anything and Obama has said he wants the
[02:09:44.180 --> 02:09:49.100]  assault weapons ban back and diane feinstein as you know is said that means
[02:09:49.100 --> 02:09:53.860]  physical she wants California style where you have to turn them in she wants
[02:09:53.860 --> 02:09:59.580]  gun show shut down and again I did a 20 minute special report last week titled
[02:09:59.580 --> 02:10:03.140]  you know proof Obama is coming for your guns but I thought we should get Larry
[02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:07.300]  Pratt on for about 40 minutes or so and then we'll go to your phone calls those
[02:10:07.300 --> 02:10:12.260]  you that are holding and get into some of the economic news that I have not not
[02:10:12.260 --> 02:10:16.780]  gotten into yet in any detail that we need to cover but I mean this is just
[02:10:16.780 --> 02:10:22.300]  from last year and again this year ATF to accept public comments prior to
[02:10:22.300 --> 02:10:26.060]  outlawing shotguns and then you go they have a link in the Greeley Gazette
[02:10:26.060 --> 02:10:29.580]  this should have been national news to the ATF they said oh we're gonna have a
[02:10:29.580 --> 02:10:35.260]  rulemaking saying we're gonna ban most shotguns 60 plus percent made in last
[02:10:35.260 --> 02:10:41.180]  decade that can take a clip that can be converted to take a clip well that's
[02:10:41.180 --> 02:10:45.220]  any gun that is semi auto or pump that you load in the bottom that's pretty
[02:10:45.220 --> 02:10:51.660]  much all my shotguns so it's not just law they're suing on manufacturers
[02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:54.940]  Bloomberg who also wants to tell you what you can eat and drink these are
[02:10:54.940 --> 02:10:59.220]  control freaks they want us to live like folks in Chicago and New York with six
[02:10:59.220 --> 02:11:02.540]  seven locks on our doors the great people in New York and Chicago not allowed
[02:11:02.540 --> 02:11:06.020]  to defend themselves this is mafia government we're on the air by the way
[02:11:06.020 --> 02:11:09.380]  in Chicago we've had folks call in saying they wish they could have guns
[02:11:09.380 --> 02:11:15.180]  almost impossible to get one and they harass people statewide there but not
[02:11:15.180 --> 02:11:19.140]  but but those cities is where they really restricted California highly
[02:11:19.140 --> 02:11:22.940]  restrictive and if you look at a map of the world most countries of ban guns
[02:11:22.940 --> 02:11:27.700]  outright and they always follow the same pattern so the plunge is happening now
[02:11:27.700 --> 02:11:34.340]  and I know Larry Platt doesn't like to be alarmist but what did Barry Goldwater
[02:11:34.340 --> 02:11:38.860]  say extremism and defensive liberty is you know vice so I really want him
[02:11:38.860 --> 02:11:42.540]  pun intended to hit him with both barrels gun owners.org he's the
[02:11:42.540 --> 02:11:46.140]  executive director of Gun Owners of America for 30 years needs no no
[02:11:46.140 --> 02:11:51.100]  introduction and again the NRA's gotten better I remember talking to Larry 12
[02:11:51.100 --> 02:11:54.540]  years ago and saying that you've got to go after the NRA for their 68 gun
[02:11:54.540 --> 02:11:58.220]  control act support for their current support and he finally sort of going
[02:11:58.220 --> 02:12:01.540]  after him a few years ago when they were basically saying oh we can have some
[02:12:01.540 --> 02:12:04.660]  you know restriction they've they've gotten a little better but still gun
[02:12:04.660 --> 02:12:09.740]  owners is the place to keep the NRA honest so all I could say is go sign up
[02:12:09.740 --> 02:12:15.380]  become a member I get their free email alerts gun owners.org because we
[02:12:15.380 --> 02:12:18.620]  would have our guns basically banned if it wasn't for Gun Owners of America and
[02:12:18.620 --> 02:12:23.580]  you supporting them and many others and it's just a fact understand folks we
[02:12:23.580 --> 02:12:27.740]  don't have a lot of allies but the ones we've got are like big junkyard dogs in
[02:12:27.740 --> 02:12:33.500]  defense of the Republic Larry how bad is it because we know the former chief of
[02:12:33.500 --> 02:12:35.980]  staff at the White House said we're gonna put you on a no-gun buy list we
[02:12:35.980 --> 02:12:39.500]  know they're moving towards that I mean they are licking their chops right now
[02:12:39.500 --> 02:12:43.660]  Obama said in the second debate that he wants to ban not just semi-auto rifles
[02:12:43.660 --> 02:12:48.180]  but handguns so so they're letting us know the UN has reconvened there they're
[02:12:48.180 --> 02:12:52.540]  letting us know that you in gold of quote banning civilian ownership of
[02:12:52.540 --> 02:12:56.140]  firearms saying they threaten the legitimate power monopoly of the state
[02:12:56.140 --> 02:13:03.380]  that's July 7th 2001 unideer I mean how bad is it what is the state of our
[02:13:03.380 --> 02:13:06.780]  precious Second Amendment the only country really in the world left other
[02:13:06.780 --> 02:13:11.940]  than Switzerland that doesn't have disarmed slaves well Alex first of all
[02:13:11.940 --> 02:13:18.260]  thank you so much for letting me appear before your viewers and listeners you
[02:13:18.260 --> 02:13:22.500]  have a tremendous audience and very grateful every time I have a chance to
[02:13:22.500 --> 02:13:29.380]  visit with you I don't think your concerns are misplaced I think this
[02:13:29.380 --> 02:13:35.340]  president showed us during the time when he still had to face reelection that he
[02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:41.780]  didn't have any basic problems certainly no moral objection to rule ruling
[02:13:41.780 --> 02:13:47.940]  illegally and to ruling unconstitutionally and his use of the
[02:13:47.940 --> 02:13:54.660]  executive order is something like perhaps ten times what George Bush's was
[02:13:54.660 --> 02:14:00.500]  and his was quite a bit more than those before him so we have seen government
[02:14:00.500 --> 02:14:08.900]  growing like a metastatic cancer here in Washington and its enclaves all around
[02:14:08.900 --> 02:14:14.180]  the country and I suppose around the world it's just stunning to me that we
[02:14:14.180 --> 02:14:19.220]  have reelected a man who really doesn't give a rip about his oath of office
[02:14:19.220 --> 02:14:22.900]  whatever he understands by the Constitution isn't what the founders
[02:14:22.900 --> 02:14:29.860]  understood and so I think we're in for as you're indicating a real time I would
[02:14:29.860 --> 02:14:35.220]  have no surprise if the president were to have his Department of Justice issue
[02:14:35.220 --> 02:14:41.100]  an edict to gun stores who were ultimately under them through the Bureau
[02:14:41.100 --> 02:14:44.380]  of Alcohol the back of the firearms and explosives which is part of the Department
[02:14:44.380 --> 02:14:50.420]  of Justice telling their dealers you'll lose your license after oh maybe maybe
[02:14:50.420 --> 02:14:56.900]  30 days from now if you sell another handgun that has a caliber bigger than
[02:14:56.900 --> 02:15:03.580]  380 or if you sell a long gun rifle or shotgun that accepts a high capacity
[02:15:03.580 --> 02:15:08.740]  magazine and as you indicated that's probably most of your shotguns and any
[02:15:08.740 --> 02:15:13.620]  rifles you might have might also fit that same description it's going to hit
[02:15:13.620 --> 02:15:17.940]  if he were to do something like that in a way that the dealers would have no
[02:15:17.940 --> 02:15:24.540]  choice because unconstitutionally they have to have it right now they have to
[02:15:24.540 --> 02:15:29.860]  have a permit a license from the federalis in order to be able to open a
[02:15:29.860 --> 02:15:34.140]  business and stay in business and today they pull that license from any dealer
[02:15:34.140 --> 02:15:38.740]  he's out of business he can no longer sell any of his guns to the general
[02:15:38.740 --> 02:15:45.060]  public he's finished and so if your livelihood depends on that unconstitutional
[02:15:45.060 --> 02:15:50.180]  scrap of paper well you're going to tend to do whatever you're told from
[02:15:50.180 --> 02:15:56.540]  Washington or else and so I I can see something like that happening and by the
[02:15:56.540 --> 02:16:01.380]  way it would probably make the UN so happy because in countries where they
[02:16:01.380 --> 02:16:07.260]  do let you have a gun my wife's from Panama and their laws are rather similar
[02:16:07.260 --> 02:16:11.540]  to those of Latin America if you can crawl over enough glass and you have
[02:16:11.540 --> 02:16:16.420]  enough connections and you finally get a permit you'll be limited to a 380 and
[02:16:16.420 --> 02:16:21.900]  you won't be able to have any long gun that accepts a high-capacity magazine so
[02:16:21.900 --> 02:16:26.940]  that's that that would make us so much more responsible in the eyes of the
[02:16:26.940 --> 02:16:31.740]  rest of the world you you know that that will be one of the arguments that well
[02:16:31.740 --> 02:16:35.860]  our good friends but if we're going to be a responsible citizen in the world
[02:16:35.860 --> 02:16:40.420]  community these are the kinds of conditions that we will have to impose
[02:16:40.420 --> 02:16:45.300]  upon ourselves in order to be a good neighbor in the international community
[02:16:45.300 --> 02:16:51.940]  barf that's I'm afraid that's what's coming down and there's two ways that I
[02:16:51.940 --> 02:16:57.900]  think we can try to deal with this one is that there's a there are a small
[02:16:57.900 --> 02:17:01.660]  number of representatives coming to the Congress the likes of which they've
[02:17:01.660 --> 02:17:08.300]  never been in my memory maybe if I go back to John Ashbrook somebody like
[02:17:08.300 --> 02:17:13.140]  that was a very outspoken conservative and died mysteriously in a Senate
[02:17:13.140 --> 02:17:21.740]  campaign years and years ago but for the recent past we've had nobody like Steve
[02:17:21.740 --> 02:17:26.260]  Stockman who just got elected from a district outside of Houston to the
[02:17:26.260 --> 02:17:32.780]  east into the north and Jackie Walorsky in the northwest corner of Indiana these
[02:17:32.780 --> 02:17:37.860]  two have a history that tells me and since I know them personally I'll just
[02:17:37.860 --> 02:17:42.060]  describe them but I understand there may be a handful of others coming with the
[02:17:42.060 --> 02:17:47.980]  same steel backbone that these two have when Stockman was in Congress for the
[02:17:47.980 --> 02:17:54.140]  his one term with the class of 94 he introduced a bill to overturn the
[02:17:54.140 --> 02:18:01.620]  recently enacted Clinton gunman and the Republicans were even more if you will
[02:18:01.620 --> 02:18:05.940]  gun-shy than they are now this was a controversial issue they didn't want to
[02:18:05.940 --> 02:18:10.420]  tell you you're going it's time to get on the offense or we're cooked it's over
[02:18:10.420 --> 02:18:15.300]  we either realize we either game ground or we're gonna lose it all this is a war
[02:18:15.300 --> 02:18:19.700]  we cannot just keep having battles we have to literally go dig these people
[02:18:19.700 --> 02:18:24.700]  out we have to call them the authoritarian scum they are because
[02:18:24.700 --> 02:18:27.700]  listen the gun culture is what the reason they call us bitter clingers is
[02:18:27.700 --> 02:18:32.780]  they know it's it's the core it's what brings everybody together even liberals
[02:18:32.780 --> 02:18:37.260]  I know on social issues get now that they need guns and we're gaining ground on
[02:18:37.260 --> 02:18:41.380]  this so they're they're coming in to take it all the bat that the final battle
[02:18:41.380 --> 02:18:46.620]  is it starting to really unfold I think so I think we're going to see the
[02:18:46.620 --> 02:18:53.100]  fangs bared by this administration again and no more elections so that he has to
[02:18:53.100 --> 02:18:57.620]  worry about and I don't think he worries about his party and only worries about
[02:18:57.620 --> 02:19:00.580]  a point about the people and bringing bills up is that what you were getting
[02:19:00.580 --> 02:19:04.020]  at is it's time to go on the offense it's time to go in the offense it's time
[02:19:04.020 --> 02:19:10.700]  to reintroduce and to push all over again repealers that repeal whole swaths
[02:19:10.700 --> 02:19:16.700]  of unconstitutional federal gun laws Stockman did it against his Republican
[02:19:16.700 --> 02:19:21.740]  leadership when he was in we were in a meeting in Dick army's office he was the
[02:19:21.740 --> 02:19:26.340]  majority leader then and he told us to our face you're not going to get a vote
[02:19:26.340 --> 02:19:31.140]  on Stockman's bill if you do it'll be over my dead body well gingrich was a
[02:19:31.140 --> 02:19:35.580]  little politically moxier we did get the vote because gingrich didn't want gun
[02:19:35.580 --> 02:19:40.220]  owners of America messing over his guys in their districts over this issue
[02:19:40.220 --> 02:19:45.100]  that's right we've got a really just just remove the rhinos put real people in
[02:19:45.100 --> 02:19:48.940]  there I want to come back and get into what I'm now seeing on the news they're
[02:19:48.940 --> 02:19:52.020]  saying it's racist on guns kind of like if you don't want government run
[02:19:52.020 --> 02:19:56.940]  healthcare your racist and Obama's now being called the conqueror I mean this

[02:24:15.180 --> 02:24:18.940]  want to just ban semi-automatic rifles he wants to ban your handguns that are
[02:24:18.940 --> 02:24:24.660]  semi-automatic that's most handguns and they've got the UN treaty coming up that
[02:24:24.660 --> 02:24:29.140]  once it's passed the member nation's 50% vote 51% it becomes law here
[02:24:29.140 --> 02:24:35.300]  they've got more Democrats in the Senate and we're in deep trouble I mean we've
[02:24:35.300 --> 02:24:38.420]  never had the Second Amendment hanging by a thread and they try to play this
[02:24:38.420 --> 02:24:42.580]  double game of going we don't want your guns you're stupid to go out and buy
[02:24:42.580 --> 02:24:45.940]  them even though every gun I've bought over the last 20-something years has
[02:24:45.940 --> 02:24:53.260]  gone up in price it's amazing and they they really can't stand the fact that
[02:24:53.260 --> 02:24:57.620]  we know their liars and we're voting with our dollars and the fact that our
[02:24:57.620 --> 02:25:00.300]  gun culture I just showed the Huffington Post article there in the last
[02:25:00.300 --> 02:25:03.940]  segment if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv but it says Obama's
[02:25:03.940 --> 02:25:09.540]  got to do something about this growing gun culture they are hitting the panic
[02:25:09.540 --> 02:25:13.340]  button we guys pull that back up that was a great article you found they are
[02:25:13.340 --> 02:25:18.500]  panicking no no not not that article about the general but general portray as
[02:25:18.500 --> 02:25:22.980]  but that one yeah Obama must take drastic action to end gun culture to end our
[02:25:22.980 --> 02:25:27.020]  culture see the media has destroyed our culture they destroyed Christianity they
[02:25:27.020 --> 02:25:30.380]  destroyed everything we don't have anything left hardly but guns I hate to
[02:25:30.380 --> 02:25:34.380]  say that but that's the one thing people still get I'm not a slave I have a right
[02:25:34.380 --> 02:25:38.500]  to defend myself places that take the guns have higher crime Larry Pratt I
[02:25:38.500 --> 02:25:42.060]  mean is that an overstatement that it's so many levels the strongest thing we've
[02:25:42.060 --> 02:25:47.260]  got it's so many areas is the guns and they know it and they are launching a
[02:25:47.260 --> 02:25:52.580]  total assault on it a do you agree be what do we do to defeat them I mean I
[02:25:52.580 --> 02:25:57.420]  agree with you go on the offense well in addition to going on the offense and I
[02:25:57.420 --> 02:26:03.500]  think now we have some players who are willing to play offense I mentioned two
[02:26:03.500 --> 02:26:07.220]  of them Steve Stockman a new representative in the House of Representatives
[02:26:07.220 --> 02:26:12.500]  here in Washington and Jackie Walorsky also a new representative they have a
[02:26:12.500 --> 02:26:18.380]  history of standing up to their party leaders elected leaders and Jackie
[02:26:18.380 --> 02:26:23.500]  Walorsky's case she bucked Governor Mitch Daniels who is known as a fiscal
[02:26:23.500 --> 02:26:27.180]  conservative well he wanted to raise taxes to balance the budget and she
[02:26:27.180 --> 02:26:31.740]  bucked him and got the whole caucus eventually to go along with her forcing
[02:26:31.740 --> 02:26:38.060]  him to make cuts instead of raising taxes now in a way that's almost it's at
[02:26:38.060 --> 02:26:41.620]  least as impressive as what Stockman did because Stockman got his vote on the
[02:26:41.620 --> 02:26:47.060]  gun issue and unlike the last time if it goes over to the Senate it's not going
[02:26:47.060 --> 02:26:52.580]  to be smothered by a Bob Dole and Harry Reid has shown that when push comes to
[02:26:52.580 --> 02:26:58.740]  shove he's a little reluctant to have an up or down vote on a gun issue and so
[02:26:58.740 --> 02:27:03.260]  what I think might well happen is we'll get something out of the house it'll go
[02:27:03.260 --> 02:27:08.100]  over to the Senate Reid won't want to bring it up but the rules of the Senate
[02:27:08.100 --> 02:27:14.940]  are rather somewhat more available for getting things done and as an amendment
[02:27:14.940 --> 02:27:21.660]  on threat of a filibuster I can see somebody like Jim DeMint, Mike Lee, Randa
[02:27:21.660 --> 02:27:27.220]  Paul, Ted Cruz, somebody of that sort making sure that there's a fight to amend
[02:27:27.220 --> 02:27:31.900]  a say a spending bill that the president has shown in the past he will sign
[02:27:31.900 --> 02:27:38.420]  even with pro-gun amendments to it and that way we could actually have the
[02:27:38.420 --> 02:27:42.860]  prospect of getting something done. Sure so it's time to get on the offense
[02:27:42.860 --> 02:27:45.300]  briefly we're gonna come back with part of the next segment and then let you
[02:27:45.300 --> 02:27:50.420]  go because only you're a busy man oh you had one more point no we can break if
[02:27:50.420 --> 02:27:53.220]  you need to that's fine no no I was just gonna say shifting gears another
[02:27:53.220 --> 02:27:57.660]  subject because I mentioned it before the break we are seeing and I'm getting
[02:27:57.660 --> 02:28:01.460]  callers saying this when I'm defending the Second Amendment saying you're just
[02:28:01.460 --> 02:28:06.340]  a racist and I go what does that mean and they can't even say and now I'm
[02:28:06.340 --> 02:28:11.900]  seeing MSNBC and people say aha the age of the white man's over you're gonna
[02:28:11.900 --> 02:28:15.580]  have to turn your guns in and I'm getting emails and seeing comments on
[02:28:15.580 --> 02:28:21.700]  YouTube this is some new meme like like like oh it's like a it's like a weird
[02:28:21.700 --> 02:28:25.620]  reverse racism or something and the cover of Newsweek says you're white
[02:28:25.620 --> 02:28:31.140]  your history the Obama conquest and he's in a Napoleon outfit with a sword it's
[02:28:31.140 --> 02:28:36.020]  like some on the left now just are screaming for authoritarianism but it's
[02:28:36.020 --> 02:28:41.980]  it's almost like Hitlerian though because it's mixed with a weird racial vitriol
[02:28:41.980 --> 02:28:47.100]  that I guess MSNBC's been able to sell it's very bizarre yeah they've they've
[02:28:47.100 --> 02:28:52.620]  learned that many conservatives or at least many quote Republicans are
[02:28:52.620 --> 02:28:59.020]  cowed by the playing of the race card and I think what we need to do is to if
[02:28:59.020 --> 02:29:04.900]  we're I speak Spanish I address Spanish audiences I did a debate for an hour on
[02:29:04.900 --> 02:29:11.140]  CNN and Espanyol and the point has to be made that the fact that guns are
[02:29:11.140 --> 02:29:17.460]  readily available here is why America is different it's a tangible expression of
[02:29:17.460 --> 02:29:22.740]  the American spirit that we the people are in charge not the governments from
[02:29:22.740 --> 02:29:28.020]  which you fled to get here to America I want to hear you break that down further
[02:29:28.020 --> 02:29:31.540]  when we come back because it's fundamental that if they can get our
[02:29:31.540 --> 02:29:34.980]  guns they believe they've won I mean because then it's about living under
[02:29:34.980 --> 02:29:37.500]  the socialist they're gonna take everything we got I mean this is
[02:29:37.500 --> 02:29:43.140]  slavery Hitler took the guns Stalin took the guns Lenin Mao Mao say tongue
[02:29:43.140 --> 02:29:46.540]  some political power goes out of the barrel of a gun the big government

[02:33:22.620 --> 02:33:25.740]  says prepare for massive market meltdown we're gonna get to that and then some of
[02:33:25.740 --> 02:33:29.060]  your phone calls when Larry Pratt leaves us Larry I've been asking a lot of the
[02:33:29.060 --> 02:33:33.460]  questions here I want you to be able to add any other points that you think are
[02:33:33.460 --> 02:33:37.060]  important for listeners and other assaults we're gonna see but they tell us
[02:33:37.060 --> 02:33:40.220]  they're coming after our guns they go you got a second amendment we just have a
[02:33:40.220 --> 02:33:45.020]  right to take them but finishing up the point that you were trying to get to
[02:33:45.020 --> 02:33:49.580]  because they say oh I mean it's racist that our guns are killing people in
[02:33:49.580 --> 02:33:53.420]  Mexico well Mexico's banned guns and most the guys that have them it's hang
[02:33:53.420 --> 02:33:56.500]  grenades and grenade launchers and machine guns they're not getting those
[02:33:56.500 --> 02:33:59.980]  at gun stores you know it's turned out the ATF was shipping them directly into
[02:33:59.980 --> 02:34:05.100]  Mexico fast and furious goes a lot deeper but finishing up with this weird
[02:34:05.100 --> 02:34:11.100]  racial vitriol where Time Magazine says you're white your history and shows
[02:34:11.100 --> 02:34:15.940]  Obama as a general with a sword I mean that's pretty they show him as a
[02:34:15.940 --> 02:34:19.780]  dictator they also show him as Lincoln and say he may have to deal with the
[02:34:19.780 --> 02:34:25.540]  states we have a Texas now in less than 24 hours what is it 50 something thousand
[02:34:25.540 --> 02:34:30.580]  second church now it was 25,000 in hours saying we want to secede we need to
[02:34:30.580 --> 02:34:33.300]  just kick the globalist out of this country and just take our country back
[02:34:33.300 --> 02:34:37.660]  but I mean where do you see Obama going and again you were trying to finish your
[02:34:37.660 --> 02:34:42.380]  point about this whole racism angle it's like hey I don't like lemon pie why are
[02:34:42.380 --> 02:34:45.300]  you racist you know it's like hey I don't like your food this restaurant what
[02:34:45.300 --> 02:34:49.980]  are you racist it's just this my and people call in like it's powerful like
[02:34:49.980 --> 02:34:54.180]  they're gonna say why are you a racist when I'm talking about not wanting to
[02:34:54.180 --> 02:34:57.780]  shut down our cold power plants and I go what do you mean I'm racist well you
[02:34:57.780 --> 02:35:02.340]  know you are you don't like Obama and I go yeah I don't like him he's a front
[02:35:02.340 --> 02:35:06.980]  man for the globalist I mean it's like a religion now I mean what can you say to
[02:35:06.980 --> 02:35:09.380]  this you were you were getting cut off by the break talking about your seeing
[02:35:09.380 --> 02:35:15.100]  in debate well I think it's somewhat disappointing for the other side to
[02:35:15.100 --> 02:35:21.060]  realize that there are a number of us on the right who I'm married to a Latin
[02:35:21.060 --> 02:35:27.180]  American woman have been for almost 50 years and I can debate them in Spanish
[02:35:27.180 --> 02:35:32.380]  and so that kind of takes a little bit of the starch out of their shirt I think
[02:35:32.380 --> 02:35:38.820]  because it doesn't fit the stereotype that somebody that they just assume if
[02:35:38.820 --> 02:35:42.620]  you don't agree with me as you were saying Alex it's one size fits all well
[02:35:42.620 --> 02:35:46.020]  you're racist I mean if you don't agree with me down the line everything I say
[02:35:46.020 --> 02:35:53.460]  you're a racist they don't increasingly have the ability to debate their point
[02:35:53.460 --> 02:36:00.420]  and when I did the CNN debate in Spanish it they felt to I guess they were
[02:36:00.420 --> 02:36:05.620]  comfortable with the strength in numbers so it was three against one but you know
[02:36:05.620 --> 02:36:09.020]  it's all the same argument so I was really only debating one other that
[02:36:09.020 --> 02:36:15.540]  argument that they all three were making and they don't I'm not sure they figured
[02:36:15.540 --> 02:36:21.220]  out how to get out of that pit now so far they were able to do a very effective
[02:36:21.220 --> 02:36:27.180]  job with Mitt Romney because Mitt Romney who doesn't share say a Reagan view of
[02:36:27.180 --> 02:36:31.660]  America's greatness and he doesn't how to articulate it that's for sure and he
[02:36:31.660 --> 02:36:37.380]  didn't and so he let Obama get away with anything he wanted and in fact as you
[02:36:37.380 --> 02:36:43.380]  say they came up with the race card in the fast and furious scandal wait wait
[02:36:43.380 --> 02:36:50.580]  excuse me those are Mexicans that are dying almost none of whom trace back to
[02:36:50.580 --> 02:36:56.900]  Spain through my wife's lineage these are people who are brown who are typical
[02:36:56.900 --> 02:37:03.380]  Latin Americans and I thought it was kind of racist to kill some 400 plus in
[02:37:03.380 --> 02:37:08.460]  counting with guns that our government sent down there for that purpose but I
[02:37:08.460 --> 02:37:12.600]  mean yeah that racist sure I mean you're right but I mean it's literally like you
[02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:17.380]  said you go hey I don't want socialism I don't want to lose our freedoms and they
[02:37:17.380 --> 02:37:20.520]  just call in and go you're a racist right and then they wait like you're
[02:37:20.520 --> 02:37:26.940]  about to fall over and I guess they and they repeat talking points of MSNBC and
[02:37:26.940 --> 02:37:32.060]  Chris Matthews and Rachel Maddow and all of them I mean they get up there and they
[02:37:32.060 --> 02:37:36.500]  say if you don't like health care it's because you're racist no I don't I know
[02:37:36.500 --> 02:37:40.220]  government's gonna ruin health care and look the prices are already going up the
[02:37:40.220 --> 02:37:46.580]  economy's shutting down I mean socialism I had a guy call in you know who said
[02:37:46.580 --> 02:37:50.060]  he was a socialist and when I said well I don't like socialism we see he's
[02:37:50.060 --> 02:37:53.580]  endorsed communism before his name John from Ohio he's called many times he's
[02:37:53.580 --> 02:37:57.140]  a white guy and when I said look socialism doesn't work he goes well
[02:37:57.140 --> 02:38:02.740]  that's a typical racist statement and I'm like I mean the Russians are white it
[02:38:02.740 --> 02:38:06.220]  didn't work over there I mean you know there's hardly any black people over
[02:38:06.220 --> 02:38:09.900]  there maybe you know one out of a thousand what is that now racist too I
[02:38:09.900 --> 02:38:15.060]  mean it's like I mean if I say I like lemon pie over cheesecake they go
[02:38:15.060 --> 02:38:19.500]  that's racist I mean it's like if I say I like blue skies instead of you know
[02:38:19.500 --> 02:38:24.300]  red skies it's I mean it's like if I haven't all they say is that it's like
[02:38:24.300 --> 02:38:29.700]  a weird cult of people just like parrot racism racism right it's really bizarre
[02:38:29.700 --> 02:38:35.580]  racism racism racism some of the folks that have been produced by the public
[02:38:35.580 --> 02:38:41.500]  schools the government schools are probably okay with that comeback that's
[02:38:41.500 --> 02:38:47.820]  racist but frankly a lot of people in this country still can think and if
[02:38:47.820 --> 02:38:53.060]  that's the way they want to conduct a debate in front of the American people
[02:38:53.060 --> 02:38:58.860]  bring it on I think it's time we we have that debate and let the whole country
[02:38:58.860 --> 02:39:04.100]  see just how inadequate their argument why would Newsweek come out and have
[02:39:04.100 --> 02:39:10.980]  David from has attacked me seven ways to Sunday come out and say if you're white
[02:39:10.980 --> 02:39:15.620]  your history I mean that isn't it and then I see that as a meme online it's
[02:39:15.620 --> 02:39:19.540]  like trying to I guess they want the left really wants to try to have a race
[02:39:19.540 --> 02:39:24.780]  war in the hopper well golly you're gonna have to be attacked by somebody at
[02:39:24.780 --> 02:39:29.140]  more substance than this week they are no longer publishing in paper they're
[02:39:29.140 --> 02:39:35.580]  only online what what the American people are not buying that stuff and if
[02:39:35.580 --> 02:39:40.220]  that little kept house conservative mr. Fromm is happy associating with
[02:39:40.220 --> 02:39:47.260]  Newsweek bless his heart more power to you're right he is a just a piece of
[02:39:47.260 --> 02:39:52.820]  work what do you think this election really signified I mean I saw a lot of
[02:39:52.820 --> 02:39:57.340]  fraud against Romney I just call it like I see it some states didn't even count
[02:39:57.340 --> 02:40:01.980]  that day's boss and just said he you know that Obama was the winner I see them
[02:40:01.980 --> 02:40:06.020]  saying conservatives and libertarians had better become socialist if you ever
[02:40:06.020 --> 02:40:10.220]  want to win the Democrats well I mean you if you became Stalin they would
[02:40:10.220 --> 02:40:15.380]  become linen if you became linen they would become Marx there's no way to
[02:40:15.380 --> 02:40:19.620]  ever become them to win because you've already become them you've got to go out
[02:40:19.620 --> 02:40:24.380]  and promote real constitutionalism we saw 12 million to 15 million Ron Paul
[02:40:24.380 --> 02:40:27.620]  people go out and not vote this time because of the way they were treated
[02:40:27.620 --> 02:40:32.820]  and in a way some say let it get worse that's what will cause real change I
[02:40:32.820 --> 02:40:37.660]  mean is there way to make lemons out of this lemonade well I'd prefer to make
[02:40:37.660 --> 02:40:42.540]  lemons that I purchased rather than there were shoved down my throat sure I'll
[02:40:42.540 --> 02:40:46.700]  do what I have to do and so in addition to going on the offense in
[02:40:46.700 --> 02:40:52.700]  Congress which I think now we might be able to do we also need to keep in mind
[02:40:52.700 --> 02:40:57.420]  and you and I have talked about this before there is in most of our states
[02:40:57.420 --> 02:41:02.060]  the very powerful institution of the county sheriff in fact one of the things
[02:41:02.060 --> 02:41:07.500]  that urge people to buy at our site at gunowners.org in the media section where
[02:41:07.500 --> 02:41:12.420]  we have the bookstore or one other site you'll find the bookstore it's called
[02:41:12.420 --> 02:41:16.380]  the county sheriff by Richard Mack you've probably interviewed him excellent
[02:41:16.380 --> 02:41:19.980]  book we carry it as well people should go to gunowners.org and buy that book and
[02:41:19.980 --> 02:41:24.380]  give it to your sheriff and give it to all the sheriff candidates. Yes that's
[02:41:24.380 --> 02:41:28.340]  exactly read it first so you're sure you know what's in it but it's the history
[02:41:28.340 --> 02:41:32.820]  and the constitutional doctrine of the sheriff is the top cop because he's the
[02:41:32.820 --> 02:41:38.260]  only cop that has a an immediate delegation of authority via election from
[02:41:38.260 --> 02:41:45.020]  we the people by we the people and so it is very important that we increase the
[02:41:45.020 --> 02:41:49.260]  number of these constitutional sheriffs throughout the land who are willing and
[02:41:49.260 --> 02:41:55.620]  able to tell the feds not in my county if what you're trying to do is not an
[02:41:55.620 --> 02:41:59.100]  article one section eight of our federal constitution and there's a couple
[02:41:59.100 --> 02:42:02.300]  other things the Constitution tells them to do as well then you're not going to
[02:42:02.300 --> 02:42:05.060]  do it here in this county. And the sheriff gets their authority from the
[02:42:05.060 --> 02:42:10.660]  state constitutions expanding on that what do you make of nullification I
[02:42:10.660 --> 02:42:15.060]  think that's something we're going to really see explode now. The sheriff is
[02:42:15.060 --> 02:42:19.740]  the guy who can nullify a state legislature can nullify an acting
[02:42:19.740 --> 02:42:23.780]  legislation that's and some states have done it saying there's not going to be
[02:42:23.780 --> 02:42:29.460]  any exchange for Obamacare in our state they are just flat out telling the feds
[02:42:29.460 --> 02:42:36.340]  take a hike that's what the federal system was designed to do and now with
[02:42:36.340 --> 02:42:41.020]  25 states I think is the latest count petitioning the White House for
[02:42:41.020 --> 02:42:45.220]  secession and it's a rather more serious matter than any of the other states
[02:42:45.220 --> 02:42:50.500]  when Texas does that because Texas came into the Union with the proviso
[02:42:50.500 --> 02:42:57.820]  explicit proviso that it can also say adios and it can be on its way that's
[02:42:57.820 --> 02:43:02.860]  why it's called the lone star state because it has that proviso built in
[02:43:02.860 --> 02:43:09.540]  go ahead. So I think that's a very serious threat Texas is one of the few
[02:43:09.540 --> 02:43:15.860]  healthy economies in this among the states of this country it's robust it
[02:43:15.860 --> 02:43:21.420]  has a conservative political culture and frankly I think there could be a
[02:43:21.420 --> 02:43:26.340]  majority of Texas that say you know why not we've got our own seacoast if they
[02:43:26.340 --> 02:43:30.300]  want they can't really boycott our airports because we have too many hubs
[02:43:30.300 --> 02:43:34.500]  that are central for the airlines that we're just too important for them to
[02:43:34.500 --> 02:43:39.340]  ignore and if they do they really think they're going to invade Texas and take
[02:43:39.340 --> 02:43:44.860]  it over you know they tried that once and they got away with it that one time
[02:43:44.860 --> 02:43:47.620]  I don't think they get away with this time I don't think the military would
[02:43:47.620 --> 02:43:52.140]  would most of them would say that's not a constitutional order I'm not gonna do
[02:43:52.140 --> 02:43:55.780]  it. Well the Texas legislature last year said you're not going to grope us
[02:43:55.780 --> 02:43:59.340]  anymore because all of the house reps have been flying into Austin had been
[02:43:59.340 --> 02:44:04.020]  getting groped unanimous house vote Dewhurst killed it in the Senate so he
[02:44:04.020 --> 02:44:08.460]  lost his national Senate run Cruz says he's gonna support the second amendment
[02:44:08.460 --> 02:44:14.140]  Ron Paul type guy we'll let's see if that's really the case but expanding on
[02:44:14.140 --> 02:44:19.580]  all of this they threaten a federal blockade with aircraft I say throw me in
[02:44:19.580 --> 02:44:23.260]  that briar patch let's get this confrontation going let's show what
[02:44:23.260 --> 02:44:28.940]  crooks you are right I don't I think that blockade would hurt the remaining
[02:44:28.940 --> 02:44:32.700]  states more than it would hurt Texas and it could well precipitate a
[02:44:32.700 --> 02:44:39.340]  sympathetic joining of Texas's action you know it's gonna happen we need Texas
[02:44:39.340 --> 02:44:43.100]  to lead out of this new order takeover and then we can reconstitute the
[02:44:43.100 --> 02:44:46.300]  Republic because there's no doubt Larry we've got a globalist takeover in
[02:44:46.300 --> 02:44:49.780]  Washington they think they've conquered this country they brag on the news that
[02:44:49.780 --> 02:44:53.420]  these foreign banks have taken us over they're the ones that want us disarmed
[02:44:53.420 --> 02:44:57.900]  so that they can create socialism to suck our money offshore to themselves and
[02:44:57.900 --> 02:45:02.540]  they want to use a giant gaggle of illegals and welfare queens as their
[02:45:02.540 --> 02:45:06.500]  army and I just you know it's time to call them on it it's time to get in their
[02:45:06.500 --> 02:45:13.020]  face Texas could effectively seal its own border that would be an extremely
[02:45:13.020 --> 02:45:20.020]  positive first step whether or not they ultimately secede to simply say we're
[02:45:20.020 --> 02:45:25.060]  being invaded United States you're supposed to protect us from invasion
[02:45:25.060 --> 02:45:29.620]  you're not we're going to take that over because we didn't give that power away
[02:45:29.620 --> 02:45:33.340]  we just said that was something the federal government should do but if
[02:45:33.340 --> 02:45:37.380]  you're not gonna do it we're gonna do it and what are the feds gonna do invade
[02:45:37.380 --> 02:45:42.340]  Texas in order to not close the border I think at some point the American people
[02:45:42.340 --> 02:45:48.060]  gonna say what one of the the biggest problem I saw with Romney is he as a
[02:45:48.060 --> 02:45:54.020]  liberal would not join issues and he would not call Obama the socialist that
[02:45:54.020 --> 02:46:00.460]  he is he would not specifically draw attention to the many socialist programs
[02:46:00.460 --> 02:46:06.140]  that Obama has been implementing and advocating and he would not address the
[02:46:06.140 --> 02:46:11.620]  country in terms of the greatness of America what it has been and what it can
[02:46:11.620 --> 02:46:16.260]  be again he didn't spell any of that out and sure because he couldn't he agree
[02:46:16.260 --> 02:46:21.100]  with Obama on so much instead of again people going and joining the globalist
[02:46:21.100 --> 02:46:26.300]  this this is a real shot across the bow the Republicans that that no more games
[02:46:26.300 --> 02:46:30.340]  they're not co-opting the Liberty Movement it's over they're either gonna
[02:46:30.340 --> 02:46:33.860]  disappear and let the Democrats take over and a bunch of states are gonna
[02:46:33.860 --> 02:46:38.580]  secede or the power structure is gonna get it right they're either gonna have
[02:46:38.580 --> 02:46:42.100]  to act like Republicans talk in other words they're gonna have to walk the talk
[02:46:42.100 --> 02:46:49.500]  or I agree with you there will be and at first I think we might see next
[02:46:49.500 --> 02:46:56.580]  election an increase in what we saw this time the establishment continue to lose
[02:46:56.580 --> 02:47:01.620]  in contests that are brought by conservatives the one in your Texas
[02:47:01.620 --> 02:47:07.500]  Senate race was a great example of an outsider challenging the establishment
[02:47:07.500 --> 02:47:12.380]  do first and do first showed what the establishment was like he's a
[02:47:12.380 --> 02:47:19.660]  facilitator of all that is wrong in Texas he makes it happen or keeps reform
[02:47:19.660 --> 02:47:24.620]  from happening as a lieutenant governor there in Texas exactly yeah the
[02:47:24.620 --> 02:47:29.940]  terrible record and Cruz called him on it showed how you should run a campaign
[02:47:29.940 --> 02:47:35.060]  and when people hear that there is a distinction being drawn by somebody who
[02:47:35.060 --> 02:47:40.140]  really believes in freedom the freedom fighter is often going to win and we
[02:47:40.140 --> 02:47:43.860]  will there's no doubt Ron Paul would have beaten Obama but the Republicans had
[02:47:43.860 --> 02:47:48.140]  to throw him out of there and so now look what they've gotten Larry Pratt by
[02:47:48.140 --> 02:47:51.140]  the way we were gun owners.org never seen this happen before we crashed your

[02:49:25.700 --> 02:49:31.860]  you're on the air go ahead how you doing Alex good I want to start off by
[02:49:31.860 --> 02:49:35.420]  saying I do not support Obama and I do not support the actions that he is
[02:49:35.420 --> 02:49:39.900]  undergoing with the country at the moment but my real question I want to get
[02:49:39.900 --> 02:49:43.940]  your take on when are we gonna see Denver Airport come into play from the
[02:49:43.940 --> 02:49:49.540]  research that I've done is that it's gonna be the the base for the for the
[02:49:49.540 --> 02:49:54.980]  globalist elite to survive while they're just destroying every yeah I mean
[02:49:54.980 --> 02:49:59.340]  it's official that Colorado is the designated secondary capital it's got a
[02:49:59.340 --> 02:50:02.540]  bunch of underground bases in Colorado Springs they're at norad and all over
[02:50:02.540 --> 02:50:06.100]  Denver there's a bunch of underground stuff there at Denver that's just a
[02:50:06.100 --> 02:50:09.220]  globalist day in in case they have a nuclear war with China or Russia and
[02:50:09.220 --> 02:50:13.220]  they have the COG government operating there the Congress is all vestigial
[02:50:13.220 --> 02:50:20.100]  unless Congress stands up and retakes its power and so yeah that's my take on
[02:50:20.100 --> 02:50:25.940]  that on the Denver Airport serve so you think that we're gonna be seeing a lot
[02:50:25.940 --> 02:50:31.820]  more action with it coming here shortly no we already have a Northcom military
[02:50:31.820 --> 02:50:36.500]  over the U.S. we already have space command base there the real government
[02:50:36.500 --> 02:50:40.420]  is based there that's why there's more underground bunkers and underground
[02:50:40.420 --> 02:50:44.220]  railways and missile bases you can shake a stick at that's the head of
[02:50:44.220 --> 02:50:48.260]  Northcom that's the head of the military industrial complex it's run by foreign
[02:50:48.260 --> 02:50:54.220]  banks that's the real capital the whorehouse on the Potomac DC is just the
[02:50:54.220 --> 02:50:58.820]  crime syndicate minions that are there as a facade of a stigial ceremonial

[02:54:55.260 --> 02:54:58.860]  can catch cat and that's why they're doing everything they can to shut down our
[02:54:58.860 --> 02:55:03.420]  rural communities and to kill the gun culture
